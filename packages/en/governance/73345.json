BLAINE,\r\n  The Typical American,\r\n  DEDICATED,\r\n  BY THE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nMountains are the homes of giants,--giants in brawn and giants in\r\nbrain. The giants of brawn may be the more numerous, and in the sense\r\nof muscle and fisticuffs, more powerful; but not in the sense of\r\nmanhood and power that achieves results that are far-reaching and\r\nthat endure,--results that thrill a nation’s heart and command the\r\nadmiration of the world.\r\n\r\nWhoever makes you proud that you are a man,--that you are an American\r\ncitizen,--makes you feel that life is not only worth living, but that\r\nto live is joy and glory,--such an one lifts you up toward those higher\r\nregions from which man has evidently fallen, and gives some glimmer and\r\nhint of the old image and likeness in which we were created. That man\r\nwho comes from nearest to the nation’s heart and gets nearest to the\r\nworld’s heart, brings with him lessons of wisdom, goodness, and love\r\nwhich shall work like leaven with transforming power.\r\n\r\nGreat not only in brains, but great in heart, also, are the giant men\r\nof true greatness, who come down from the mountains into the arena of\r\nthe world’s activities. They need no introduction. The world awaits\r\nthem, recognizes, and hails them. They know and are known; they love\r\nand are beloved. Place awaits them, and they enter; fitness fits; life\r\nis a triumph, and they are happy. Such men, fresh from nature’s mint,\r\nbring consciences with them,--consciences unseared, into the battle of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThese are not only the germ of character and the source of joy, but\r\nchief among the elements of that stupendous strength which makes\r\nvictory their birthright, and victory is the birthright of every good,\r\ntrue soul that will work to win. Only the false and the indolent are\r\nsure to fail; the true and industrious are ever succeeding.\r\n\r\nEspecially great in powers of will are the men who come forth from the\r\nnation’s strength and give themselves back in exalted service to a\r\nnation’s life. The great streams that flow into the ocean, went forth\r\nof the ocean in mists and clouds of rain. The great men of Rome were\r\nthe products of Rome. The great men of Germany and France are the\r\nproducts of those respective countries. And so the great men of America\r\nare the products of America. It took generations to produce the heroes\r\nof the Revolution, but when the hour struck, they came forth, full\r\narmed with a purpose that blood could not weaken, clad in a panoply\r\nthat no host could destroy. Washington blazed forth as an orb of\r\ngreater magnitude in the chair of state, in time of peace, than in the\r\nsaddle in time of war. As a warrior he cut out the work, as statesman\r\nhe made it. Statesmanship is more the work of the whole man and of a\r\nlife-time. Garfield was splendid upon the field of battle, but while\r\nthere he shone as a star among suns, while in the halls of state he\r\nshone as a sun among stars. There was a steady grandeur of purpose, a\r\nmagnificence of character, a wealth of intellect, a power of thought,\r\na loftiness of courage, of that high, heroic type which moral stamina\r\nalone can produce, which created a greater demand for him in the\r\ncouncils of the nation than in the battle-front when warriors were the\r\nnation’s sorest need. Others could take his place in Tennessee, but not\r\nin Washington.\r\n\r\nAmong the nation’s great productions, born midway between the war of\r\nthe Revolution and the war of the Rebellion; born in times of peace,\r\nfor times of direst carnage and divinest peace again, a very prince\r\nof the land; born to lead, and born to rule; springing at once with\r\nthe bound of youthful blood into the foremost ranks of the nation’s\r\nmonarchs of forces, and emperors of kingly powers, is he who leads\r\nto-day the giant forces of the great nation’s conquering host, the Hon.\r\nJAMES G. BLAINE, not of Maine, or of Massachusetts; not of Minnesota,\r\nor the Golden Gate, but of America. He is a man of the nation’s heart,\r\na man of the nation’s brain, a man of conscience, and a man of will;\r\nlarge, vivid, and powerful in his consciousness, wherein he realizes,\r\nin most brilliant conceptions, both the power and glory of men and\r\nthings. He came forth from the mountains of the Alleghanies, a giant\r\nfrom the nation’s side.\r\n\r\nNever since the nation’s youth was there such demand for any man. He\r\nis emphatically the typical American, and the yeomanry would have\r\nhim. They caught his spirit, and would not shake off the spell of his\r\ngenius. They forget not to-day that he was Garfield’s first choice, and\r\nsat at Garfield’s right hand. They remember, as only they who think\r\nwith the heart can remember, that as his pride and confidant, he was\r\nby Garfield’s side in that awful hour of holy martyrdom, thrusting\r\nback the terrible assassin with one hand, and with the other catching\r\nthe falling chief. Garfield knew him, Garfield loved him, Garfield\r\nsanctioned, honored, trusted, and exalted him. And the sentiments of\r\nthat great heart which beat out its life-blood for the nation’s glory\r\nthen, it is firmly believed, are the sentiments of the nation’s heart\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I.\r\n\r\n  THE BOY.\r\n\r\n  Old Hickory--National Highway--Indian Hill Farm--The\r\n    Alleghanies--Daniel Boone and the Wetzells--Scotland\r\n    of America--Birth-Place--Ancestors--Mother--Valley\r\n    Forge--The Old Covenanters--Dickinson College--Cradle\r\n    Songs--Stories of Monmouth and Brandywine--Old\r\n    United States Spelling-Book--Country School-House--Cut\r\n    Jackets--Uncle Will--Grandfather’s Ferry--Too\r\n    Much Spurt--Capt.

He will be along in his great coach to-morrow,\r\nbefore noon,” rang out the cheery voice of Uncle Will Blaine, who\r\nseemed glad all over at the prospect of once more seeing the Hero of\r\nNew Orleans and the man of iron will.\r\n\r\n“Well, let him come,” said the Prothonotary. “I would not walk up to\r\nthe cross-roads to see him,” and the face of the old Whig grew stern\r\nwith determination.\r\n\r\n“You will let me take Jimmy, will you not, to see the old General?”\r\n\r\n“O, yes, you can take him,” the politic use of General instead of\r\nPresident having relaxed, somewhat, the stern features of the sturdy\r\nScottish face.\r\n\r\n“He’s coming! He’s coming! Hurrah! Hurrah! Here he comes,” shouted\r\nvoice after voice of the great crowd assembled on the morrow, from\r\nvalley and mountain, Uncle Will leading off at last, with the regular\r\nold-fashioned continental “Hip, Hip, Hurrah,” with three-times-three.\r\n\r\nMartial music, of the old revolutionary sort, rang out, with fife and\r\ndrum, as President Jackson, who had just been succeeded by Martin Van\r\nBuren, after serving from 1829 to 1837, stepped from his carriage, and\r\nafter a hearty greeting, spoke a few incisive words, as only the old\r\nhero could.\r\n\r\nA boy seven years old was held above the crowd, just before him, by the\r\nstrong arms of Uncle Will. The General saw the large, wondering eyes,\r\nand the eager face, patted him on the head, saying, “I am glad to see\r\nyou, my noble lad.”\r\n\r\nThe boy was James G. Blaine.\r\n\r\nThe impression of that moment remains to this hour. Little did General\r\nJackson think he was looking into the face of a future candidate for\r\nthe presidency.\r\n\r\nThe National Road over which the congressmen and presidents, and the\r\ngreat tide of travel from the west and south, passed to and from\r\nWashington, was near his father’s door.\r\n\r\nThis National highway, built by the government before the days of\r\nrailroads and steam-boats, was a strong band of union between remote\r\nsections of the country. It was a highway of commerce as well as of\r\ntravel, and formed one of the chief features in the country, so rapidly\r\nfilling up after the fearful storms of war were over and the settled\r\nyears of peace had come.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable fact, that inspired penmen have sketched the\r\ninfancy of most of the great men whose lives they have portrayed. This\r\nis beautifully true of Moses, the great emancipator and leader, a\r\nlaw-giver of the ancient Hebrew people. How they glorify the childhood\r\nof this great man, and make us love him at the start! So, also, are the\r\ninfancy and childhood of Samuel, great among the prophets of Israel,\r\ndisclosed. The voice of his heroic mother is heard as she gives him to\r\nthe Lord. The infancy of John, the mighty man at the Jordan, and of\r\nJesus, are most impressively revealed. No lovelier pictures hang on the\r\nwalls of memory; no sweeter sunshine fills the home than the little\r\nones with their joy and prattle, and with the sublime possibilities to\r\nbe unfolded as they fill up the ranks in humanity’s march, or take the\r\nlead of the myriad host.\r\n\r\nAs we go back to study the beginnings of a world, so may we well look\r\nback to behold the dawning of that life, great in the nation’s love and\r\npurpose to-day.\r\n\r\nWe shall find there a child of nature, born in no mansion or city, but\r\non “Indian farm,” upon the Washington side of the Monongahela River,\r\nopposite the village of Brownsville, and about sixty miles below\r\nPittsburgh, in the old Quaker State of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nIt was at the foot-hills of the Alleghanies, a region wild, romantic,\r\nand grand, well fitted to photograph omnipotence upon the fresh young\r\nmind, and impress it with the greatness of the world. It was a section\r\nof country whose early history is marked with all that is thrilling in\r\nthe details of Indian warfare, which constituted the chief staple of\r\nchildhood stories.\r\n\r\nDaniel Boone and the Wetzells had been there. The startled air had\r\nechoed with the crack of their rifles; the artillery of the nation\r\nhad resounded through these mountains; the black clouds of war had\r\nblown across the skies, and the smoke of battle had drifted down those\r\nvalleys.\r\n\r\nAll that is terrible in nature had its birth and home in that section\r\nof our country, which is most like the great ocean petrified in its\r\nangriest mood and mightiest upheavals. The bears and wolves, in their\r\nnumbers, ferocity, and might commanded in early days the respect even\r\nof savages, while elk and deer, antelope and fowl, and fish in endless\r\nvariety, birds and flowers of every hue, and foliage of countless\r\nspecies, won the admiration of these rude children of nature.\r\n\r\nHere in this Scotland of America, born of a sturdy ancestry whose\r\nmuscle and brain, courage and mighty wills, had made them masters of\r\nmountain and glen,--here in the heart of the continent,--James G.\r\nBlaine was born. Eternal vigilance had not only been the price of\r\nliberty in that bold mountain home for generations, but the price of\r\nlife itself.\r\n\r\nIt was in a large stone house, built by his great-grandfather\r\nGillespie, that James Gillespie Blaine was born, January 31, 1830, one\r\nof eight strong, robust, and hearty children, five of whom survive.\r\nIt was midway between the war of 1812 and the Mexican war of 1848,\r\nand in a country settled nearly fifty years before by soldiers of the\r\nRevolution. Few are born in circumstances of better promise for the\r\nfull unfolding of the faculties of body and mind than was this child\r\nof four and fifty years ago, cradled in the old stone house on the\r\nancestral farm. The house itself tells of the Old World; and those\r\nmountains whose heights are in the blue, tell of Scottish and Irish\r\nclans that never lose the old fire and the old love, and that marched\r\nfrom the conquest of the Old to the conquering of the New World.\r\n\r\nThe father, Ephraim Lyon Blaine, was of Scottish origin, and\r\nPresbyterian of truest blood, with sign and seal and signet stamp of\r\nthe old Scotch Covenanters upon life and character. His ancestors came\r\nto this country in 1720,--one hundred and ten years before the birth of\r\nJames.\r\n\r\nHis mother, Maria Gillespie, was of an Irish-Catholic family from\r\nDonegal in Ireland. They belonged to the Clan Campbell, Scotch-Irish\r\nCatholics, and descended from the Argyles of Scotland. They came to\r\nAmerica in 1764, and were Catholics through and through. They were\r\nlarge land-owners in America, and resided wholly in old colonial\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThe great-grandfather of Ephraim Lyon Blaine, father of James G.,\r\nwas born in 1741, and died at Carlisle, Penn., in March, 1804. He\r\nwas a colonel in the Revolutionary war from its commencement, and\r\nthe last four years of the war was the Commissary General. He was\r\nwith Washington amid the most trying scenes, and enjoyed his entire\r\nconfidence. During the dark winter at Valley Forge, he was by the side\r\nof the Commander-in-Chief, and it is a matter of history that the army\r\nwas saved from starvation by his vigilant and tireless activity. It is\r\nnot difficult to see how stupendous was the task of subsisting broken\r\nand shattered forces in the dead of an awful winter, upon an exhausted\r\ncountry. It required skill and courage, tact and force of personal\r\npower, not surpassed even in the daring march of Napoleon across the\r\nAlps. But he did it, brave, determined spirit that he was. Others might\r\nfalter, but not he; others might break down from sheer exhaustion or\r\ndismay, but not General Blaine, so long as the fires of the unbroken\r\nspirit of the old Covenanters heated the furnace of his heart, and\r\ntheir high resolve for liberty was enthroned in his affections.\r\n\r\nFrom such parent stock what shall the bloom and blossom be? What the\r\nfruitage and harvesting of other years from the seed-sowing of such\r\nsplendid living? Not what the height of stature, but what the stature\r\nof soul,--not what the breadth of back, nor bigness of brawn, but what\r\nthe breadth of mind and bigness of brain?\r\n\r\nLet the history of our day and generation make reply.\r\n\r\nEight years before the old patriot General died, at Carlisle, his\r\ngrandson, Ephraim Lyon Blaine, the father of James, was born in the\r\nsame quaint old Scottish town. At Dickinson College he received his\r\neducation, and settled as a lawyer in Washington County, Penn., where\r\nfor years he lived an honored and useful life as Prothonotary of the\r\nCourts; and here, amid the lull in the storm of battle-years, the boy,\r\nJames G. Blaine, was born.\r\n\r\nHis cradle-songs were the old songs of the New Republic. It is pleasant\r\nto think of such a personage coming to consciousness, clear and strong,\r\namong such hallowed scenes of a land redeemed, a nation born, a people\r\nfree. All about our youthful hero were the scarred faces and shattered\r\nforms of those who had come back from the fields of strife.\r\n\r\nThe stories of Monmouth and Brandywine, of Concord and Lexington, of\r\nNew Orleans and Yorktown, were lived over and dreamed about. Living\r\nepistles, walking histories, were all about him. Instead of reading\r\nabout them, they read to him, poured out the dearly-bought treasures of\r\na life, painted scenes that were forever impressed upon their minds;\r\nwith all the shades of life and death, unrolled the panorama of the\r\ngreat campaigns, through those long, dread battle-years. What education\r\nthis, in home and street, in shop and store, on farm and everywhere,\r\nfor patriot youth! It gave a love and zest for historic reading,\r\nwhich must be traced when we enter more largely upon his literary and\r\neducational career.\r\n\r\nAt five years of age the systematic work of an education began by\r\nsending James to a common country school near by. The old United States\r\nspelling-book was the chief textbook. Webster’s spelling-book was not\r\nthen in vogue. Nothing remarkable transpired, except to note the\r\nproficiency and steady progress he made in mastering the language he\r\nhas learned so well to use.\r\n\r\nThe intensity of his life was that within, rather than the outer life.\r\nHe was observing, drinking in with eyes and ears. Robinson Crusoe was\r\nhis first book, as it has been with many another boy, and from this\r\nbeginning he became a most omnivorous reader.\r\n\r\nHis first two teachers were ladies, and are still living. The first, a\r\nQuakeress, Miss Mary Ann Graves, now Mrs. Johnson, living near Canton,\r\nOhio, eighty-four years of age; the other was Mrs. Matilda Dorsey,\r\nstill living at Brownsville, just across the Monongahela River from\r\nWashington County, where Mr. Blaine was born. While speaking in Ohio,\r\nfive years ago, during Governor Foster’s campaign, his old teacher,\r\nMrs. Johnson, came forward at the close of his speech to congratulate\r\nher old scholar. How little these two women dreamed of the splendid\r\nfuture of the young mind they helped start up the hill of knowledge;\r\nhow little they thought of the tremendous power with which he would\r\none day use the words, great and small, he spelled out of that old\r\nbook; the great occasions upon which he would marshal them, as a\r\ngeneral marshals his men for effective warfare; of the great speeches,\r\norations, debates, papers, pamphlets, and books into which he would put\r\na power of thought that would move nations.\r\n\r\nIt was merely a country school-house, and the old frame-building has\r\nbeen torn down, and a new and more modern brick house substituted. It\r\nwas not simply to spell words, but also to read and write, and, indeed,\r\ngain the rudiments of a thorough English education.\r\n\r\nAs a learner, he exhibited the same quick, energetic traits of mind he\r\nhas since shown in the use of the knowledge gained.\r\n\r\nIt was upon the hardest kind of high, rough seats his first lessons\r\nwere learned, with none of the splendid appliances of the graded\r\nschool of to-day. Then was the time of the rod and fool’s cap, which\r\nmany remember so distinctly. Boys that fought were compelled to “cut\r\njackets,” as it was called. The stoutest boy in school was sent with\r\nan old-fashioned jack-knife to cut three long switches, stiff, and\r\nstrong, and lithe. The offending boys were called upon the floor\r\nbefore the whole school, and each one given a rod, while the teacher\r\nreserved the third. They were commanded to go at it, and at it they\r\nwent, to the uproarious delight of the whole school. Nothing could be\r\nmore ludicrous, as stroke after stroke thicker and faster fell, on\r\nshoulders, back, and legs, while the blood flew through their veins\r\nhot and tingling. The contest ended only when the switches gave out.\r\nWhen one was broken and cast away, the teacher stepped up and laid his\r\nswitch on the back of the boy whose switch was whole, while the other\r\nfellow had to stand and take it from the boy whose switch was yet\r\nsound. So they kept at it, stroke after stroke.\r\n\r\nThe demoralizing effect for the moment had a great moralizing power\r\nafterward. No boy ever wanted to take the place of one of these boys.\r\n\r\nMaster James was seldom punished at school, except to have his knuckles\r\nrapped with the ruler, or ears boxed for some slight offence; but he\r\nnever failed to take full notes of the fracas, when other boys received\r\ntheir just deserts. His observations have always been very minute, and\r\nhis remembrances distinct. Among his earliest recollections is one\r\nin 1834, when he was but four years of age, the building of a bridge\r\nacross the Monongahela River to Brownsville, by the company that\r\nconstructed the National Road. His Uncle Will took him by the hand and\r\nled him out upon the big timbers, between which he could look down and\r\nsee the waters below. The building of this bridge was a great event to\r\nthe people, and one of special interest in the Gillespie family, as his\r\ngrandfather owned the ferry, which of course the bridge superseded,\r\nand which had been a source of revenue to the extent of five thousand\r\ndollars a year to him. But in the march of progress ferries give way\r\nto bridges, as boyhood does to manhood, and by a sort of mute prophecy\r\nthat bridge made and proclaimed the way to Washington more easy. It was\r\nto him the bridge over that dark river of oblivion from the unknown of\r\nchildhood to the consciousness of youth and manhood. This same uncle,\r\nWilliam L. Gillespie, who held him by the hand while on the bridge,\r\nwas often with his favorite nephew, and exerted a strong influence for\r\ngood upon him. He was a fine scholar, a splendid gentleman, and a man\r\nof infinite jest. The impressions received from one so accomplished,\r\nand yet so genial, loving, and tender, during these walks and talks, of\r\nalmost constant and daily intercourse, are seen and felt to-day in the\r\ncharacter of the nephew of whom we write.\r\n\r\nThe first outbreak in the nature of young James, and which shows\r\nlatent barbarism so common to human nature, was a little escapade\r\nwhich happened when about five years old. A Welshman, by the name of\r\nStephen Westley, was digging a well in the neighborhood; in some way\r\nhe had injured the boy and greatly enraged him. The man at the top of\r\nthe well had gone away, and Master James, who never failed to see an\r\nopportunity, or to estimate it at its proper value and improve it\r\npromptly, stepped upon the scene.\r\n\r\nHe found his man just where he wanted him, and without reflection as\r\nto consequences, began immediately to throw clods and stones upon\r\nhim, which of course was no source of amusement to the man below. He\r\nscreamed lustily, and on being rescued went to the house and complained\r\nof the young offender, saying,--\r\n\r\n“He has too much _spurt_” (spirit).\r\n\r\nIt cost James a good thrashing, but the Welshman is not the only one\r\nwho has had just cause to feel that “_he had too much spirit_.” Indeed\r\nit is the same great, determined spirit, trained, tempered, and toned\r\nby the stern conflict of life, which is the law of fullest development,\r\nand brought under complete control, that has given Mr. Blaine his\r\nnational prominence, and filled the American mind with the proud dream\r\nof his leadership.\r\n\r\nHis grandfather Gillespie was the great man of that region. His Indian\r\nHill farm, with its several large houses and barns, was a prominent\r\nfeature of the country. He was a man of large wealth for his time;\r\nbuilt mills and engaged in various enterprises, damming the river for\r\nmilling purposes, which was a herculean task. In 1811, in company with\r\nCapt. Henry Shreve, later of Shreveport, he sent the first steamer\r\nfrom Pittsburgh. It was not until the year following that Fulton and\r\nLivingston began building steamers in that city.\r\n\r\nThis grandfather, Neal Gillespie, was five years old when the war of\r\nthe Revolution began, and as a boy received the full impression of\r\nthose scenes from the very midst of the fray in his Pennsylvania home.\r\nIt doubtless helped to produce and awaken in him that great energy\r\nof character, and force of personality which enabled him to amass\r\na fortune in that western wild, and in every way help forward the\r\ncountry’s development.\r\n\r\nIt was the good fortune of James to spend the first nine years of\r\nhis life in the closest relations of grandson to grandsire, with\r\nthis remarkable man; and doubtless much of that magnetism and rich\r\npersonality for which Mr. Blaine is so justly noted, may be traced to\r\nthis strong-natured and powerful ancestor upon the side of his mother,\r\nas well as to Gen. Ephraim Blaine, on the side of his father. He\r\ninherits the combined traits of character which gave them prominence\r\nand success in life.\r\n\r\nThe little country school and its slow, monotonous processes, were\r\nnot rapid enough for the swift, eager mind of the boy. He had learned\r\nto read, and a new world opened to him. He caught its charm and\r\ninspiration. He had read Scott’s Life of Napoleon before he was\r\neight years old,--a little fellow of seven, on a farm in an almost\r\nwilderness, devouring with his eager mind such a work! Half of our\r\npublic men have never even heard of it yet. But what is perfectly\r\namazing, before he was nine years old he had gone over all of\r\nPlutarch’s Lives, reciting the histories to his grandfather Gillespie,\r\nwho died when he was nine years of age.\r\n\r\nHe acquired all that Isocrates and Alcibiades tell of, before he was\r\nten years old, and it is a conviction with Mr. Blaine that the common\r\nideas of the average boy’s ability need to be greatly enlarged. Certain\r\nit was, that he inherited a hardy mental and physical constitution.\r\nLife on that great farm kept him engaged and associated constantly with\r\nmen who both enjoyed and appreciated learning, and who loved him and\r\nsaw in him at least a remarkably bright boy.\r\n\r\nEspecially did his father, who was a college-graduate and member of\r\nthe bar, see that he was steadily and persistently drilled, and to his\r\nfather Mr. Blaine freely gives the credit so largely and justly due.\r\nHis reading was not the careless, hap-hazard doing of a big-brained\r\nboy, who read from curiosity simply to while away time, but there was\r\nmethod in it,--a quieting hand was on him,--it was all done under\r\nintelligent, wise, and loving direction.\r\n\r\nThere was none of the hard, rough, and bitter experiences in his\r\nboyhood days or early manhood, to which so many of our nation’s great\r\nmen were subjected. He had none of the long and desperate struggle with\r\npoverty and adversity which hung on Mr. Garfield’s early years. He knew\r\nnothing by experience of the privations and hardships through which Mr.\r\nLincoln came to the high honors of the nation and the world; but sprang\r\nfrom the second generation after the Revolutionary War, and from a long\r\nline of ancestors who had been large land-owners and gentlemen in the\r\nsense of wealth and education, as well as in that finely cultivated\r\nsense, of which Mr. Blaine is himself so excellent an exponent.\r\n\r\nJames worked on the farm, carried water to the men, and carried the\r\nsheaves of grain together for the shockers, and did just as any\r\nschool-boy on a farm would do;--hunt the eggs, frolic with the calves,\r\nfeed the pigs, drive up the cows, run on errands, pet the lambs, bring\r\nin wood, and split the kindlings. He loved the sports in which boys\r\nstill delight; went fishing, played ball, rowed his boat on the river,\r\nand would laugh, and jump, and tumble, and run equal to any boy.\r\nAll the boys about him were sons or grandsons of old Revolutionary\r\nsoldiers. They had a lesson which this day does not enjoy, to talk over\r\nand keep full of the old theme. The nation was then young, and new,\r\nand fresh. The Fourth of July was celebrated as it is not now; when\r\nold soldiers passed away, their deeds and worth were all talked over.\r\nThe result was an intense Americanism, for which he has since become\r\nnoted, and which has made him an American through and through, of the\r\nmost pronounced loyalty and patriotic type, as to deem a stain upon his\r\ncountry’s honor an individual disgrace.\r\n\r\nEmpty sleeves and nothing to fill them, limbs gone and no substitute\r\nfor them, were as common then comparatively as they are now, only now\r\nthere is an artificial substitute.\r\n\r\nJames enjoyed the benefits and blessings of a large family home. It was\r\nthe practice of his father to read aloud to his family, and thus the\r\nevening-hours were utilized in the early education of his children.\r\nHome training, so often neglected now, was in vogue then, and the\r\nlegal, scholarly mind of Mr. Blaine could well choose in his fatherly\r\nlove and pride, just what was best suited to the young minds about him,\r\nwhile he was amply competent to give intelligent and suitable answers\r\nto the numerous questions called forth by the narration in hand. That\r\ngreat National Road to the cities of the Union, and its larger towns,\r\nwas a highway of intelligence. Not only did it bring the mail and all\r\nthe news, but many a book, magazine, or other periodical they were\r\npleased to order.\r\n\r\nBeside, the direct communication by steamer with Pittsburgh and points\r\nabove, which had been the case eighteen years before the birth of\r\nJames, supplied abundant means for travel and correspondence with\r\nother quarters. Living where the steamers passed the highway, they\r\nwere more highly favored with facilities of commerce and the news than\r\nperhaps any other portion of the land. They could get all there was\r\ngoing. There was no telegraph, and none of the swifter means of travel\r\nso common now; canal-boats were a luxury then. But all was life and\r\nenergy. The enthusiasm of manhood was on the nation. Then, indeed, it\r\nwas in manhood’s glory. It had grown to be its own ruler and governor;\r\nwas truly of age, and did its own voting. British interference had\r\nlearned its lesson of modest withdrawal, and for the same period of\r\neighteen years no unnaturalized Englishman had been found on American\r\nsoil with a uniform on and a gun in his hand.\r\n\r\nThere was a fine piano in the home of Mr. Blaine, and the good wife and\r\nmother was an excellent player, and frequently delighted the household\r\nwith music. Songs abounded; a harpsichord was in the home, and it\r\nadded its quaint music to the melody of the circle.\r\n\r\nBut James could not leave books alone, especially history. The history\r\nof the country was read by him over and over again. The books he had\r\nread, and that had been carefully read to him by the time he was ten\r\nyears of age, would surpass in number, size, and literary value, the\r\nlibraries of many a professional man, outside his purely professional\r\nworks, and not only had the principal ones been read, but studied\r\nand recited. Seldom is any boy so highly favored with the interested\r\npersonal efforts of such a trio of educators as were the father, uncle,\r\nand grandfather of Mr. Blaine.\r\n\r\nIt is frequently said by college-graduates, that they learn more\r\noutside of the recitation-room, from association with teachers and\r\nstudents from libraries and in the societies, than in the room for\r\ninstruction. It was in associating with these relatives, cultured and\r\ngentlemanly, able and instructive, that he was encouraged and inspired\r\nto his task of learning. James mastered the spelling-book; in fact, he\r\nwas the best speller in the school, and was called out far and near\r\nto spelling-matches, and every time “that boy of Mr. Blaine’s” would\r\nstand alone and at the head, when all the neighborhood of schools was\r\n“spelled down.”\r\n\r\nOne night the word was “Enfeoff.” It came toward the last, and was\r\none of the test words. The sides were badly thinned as “independency,\r\nchamois, circumnavigation,” and a host of other difficult words\r\nhad been given out. But the hour was growing late; some of the\r\nyoung fellows began to think of going home with the girls, of a big\r\nsleigh-ride down the mountain and through the valleys, and one big,\r\nmerry load belonged over the river at Brownsville, and they began to be\r\na little restless. But still there was good interest as this favorite\r\ntriumphed, and that one went down. Finally the word was given, all\r\nmissed it and sat down but James. Every eye was on him as the president\r\nof the evening said “Next,” and our little master of the situation\r\nspelt “En-feoff.”\r\n\r\nNo effort was made to restrain the cheers. The triumph was complete.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the death of his grandfather Gillespie, who was worth about one\r\nhundred thousand dollars,--a large sum for that early time,--Mrs.\r\nBlaine inherited, among other things, one-third of the great Indian\r\nHill Farm, comprising about five hundred acres, with great houses,\r\norchards, and barns,--a small village of itself.\r\n\r\nThis, with his father’s office in the courts, and other property,\r\nplaced the family in good circumstances, and it was decided to give\r\nJames a thorough education. He was now nine years old, with a mind as\r\nfully trained and richly stored as could be found for one of his years.\r\nHe was a ready talker, and loved discussion, and so frequently showed\r\nwhat there was in him by the lively debates and conversations into\r\nwhich he was drawn.\r\n\r\nThus his ability to express himself tersely and to the point, was early\r\ndeveloped. He came to be, almost unconsciously, growing up as he did\r\namong them, the admiration and delight of the large circle of friends\r\nand loved ones, whose interest centered on and about the farm, as well\r\nas among neighbors and acquaintances.\r\n\r\nBullion’s Latin Grammar was called into requisition, and mastered so\r\nwell that he can conjugate Latin verbs as readily now as can his sons\r\nwho are recent graduates, the one of Yale, and the other of Harvard.\r\n\r\nThe thoroughness with which he did his work is a delightful feature of\r\nhis career. One is not compelled to feel that here is sham, and there\r\nis shoddy; that this is sheer pretense, and that is bold assumption, or\r\na threadbare piece of flimsy patch-work.\r\n\r\nOne word expresses the history of the man, and that one word is\r\n_mastery_. It fits the man. Mastery of self; mastery of books; mastery\r\nof men; mastery of subjects and of the situation; mastery of principles\r\nand details. He goes to the top, every time and everywhere, sooner or\r\nlater. And it is largely because he has been to the bottom first, and\r\nmastered the rudiments, one and all, and then risen to the heights, not\r\nby a single bound, but “climbing the ladder, round by round.”\r\n\r\nThe amazing power of dispatch in the man, as well as thoroughness, are\r\nonly the larger development of his youthful habit and character.\r\n\r\nIt was not so much an infinite curiosity as an infinite love of\r\nknowledge that made his young mind drink so deeply. His was a thirsty\r\nsoul, and only by drinking deeply and long could the demand be met.\r\n\r\nWhen ten years old, the great campaign of General Harrison came\r\non. He was ready for it, and soon filled up with the subject. His\r\nimpulsiveness was powerful and intelligent, vastly beyond his years.\r\n\r\nFew men were fresher or fuller of the history of the colonies and\r\nstates than this boy. He was, in fact, a little library on foot,\r\nfilled with incidents, names, and dates, familiar with the exploits\r\nof a thousand men and a score of battles, posted as to the great\r\nenterprises and measures of the day, by reason of his distinguished\r\nrelations and his abundant facilities and sources of information.\r\nPerhaps, too, no campaign was ever more intense and popular, or\r\nentered more into the heart and home-life of young and old, than that\r\nof “Tippecanoe and Tyler too,” “Log Cabin and Free Cider.” The great\r\ngatherings, barbecues, and speeches, and multiplied discussions and\r\ntalk everywhere in house and street, in office and shop, would fire any\r\nheart that could ignite, or rouse anyone not lost in lethargy. James\r\nwas not troubled that way, but was always on hand; he would sit in the\r\nchimney-corner, or out on the great porch, while the old-line Whigs\r\ngathered to read, and hear, and digest aloud the news.\r\n\r\nThe political world had dawned upon him. He was in it for sure, and\r\nin earnest. His historical mind was gathering history ripe from the\r\nboughs. It was luscious to his taste. He was somewhere in every\r\nprocession that wended its way with music and banners and mottoes\r\ninnumerable to the place of speaking, and absorbed the whole thing.\r\n\r\nFew could have voted more intelligently than he when election day came,\r\nfor few had taken a livelier interest in the whole campaign, or taken\r\nthe matter in more completely.\r\n\r\nIn three years he was admitted to college, so this was no spurt\r\nof mental power, but a steady growth, and but marked an era of\r\nintellectual unfolding.\r\n\r\nIt was a genuine and profitable source of most practical education,\r\nfor all through the great and exciting campaign he did nothing else\r\nbut attend the monster demonstrations. Dr. William Elder and Joseph\r\nLawrence, the father of Hon. George B. Lawrence, now in Congress, were\r\nparticularly powerful in impressions upon him.\r\n\r\nAmong the prominent speakers going through, who stopped to address\r\nmeetings, was Wm. C. Rivers, of Virginia, who is particularly\r\nremembered by Mr. Blaine.\r\n\r\nHon. Thomas M. T. McKenna, father of the present Judge McKenna, was\r\na distinguished personage in that portion of the state, and took an\r\nactive and influential part in the contest,--a contest full of vim,\r\nas it was the first Whig victory on a national scale, but as full of\r\ngood nature. Jackson’s severe methods and measures, throttling the\r\nNullifiers, sweeping out of existence the great United States Bank\r\nat Philadelphia, with its $150,000,000 of capital, and sundry other\r\nmeasures, had filled the people with consternation, and a great change\r\nwas imperatively demanded.\r\n\r\nNewspapers were numerous in the home of Mr. Blaine, and never escaped\r\nthe vigilant eye of the young and growing journalist and statesman.\r\nThe Washington _Reporter_ made a large impression upon him, as did\r\nalso the old Pittsburgh _Gazette_, a semi-weekly paper, and the\r\n_Tri-weekly National Intelligencer_ (Gales and Seaton, editors) was of\r\nthe strongest and most vigorous character; also, the _United States\r\nGazette_ (semi-weekly), published at Philadelphia, and edited by Joseph\r\nR. Chandler, of that city, and later on Joseph C. Neal’s _Saturday\r\nGazette_. Surely the incoming of these nine or ten papers into the home\r\nevery week, counting the semi- and tri-weekly issues, would furnish\r\nmental pabulum of the political sort in sufficient quantity to satisfy\r\nthe longing of any young mind. No wonder his growth was strong and\r\nhardy. We have heard of an American boy of ten or twelve, who followed\r\nthe Tichborne Claim case at its original trial through the English\r\ncourts, but he was a bright high-school boy, who had every advantage\r\nof the best graded schools, and improved them steadily, and yet it was\r\ngreatly to his credit. Graded schools were unknown in 1840, yet James,\r\nwho had finished reciting Plutarch’s Lives the year before to his\r\nGrandfather Gillespie, watched eagerly for the heavily loaded sheets as\r\nthey came by post or steam-boat, and posted himself on their contents.\r\nBesides these numerous papers, two magazines were taken and steadily\r\nread by the boy. They were both published in Philadelphia,--_Graham’s\r\nMagazine_ and _Godey’s Lady’s Book_. The one was dinner, and the other\r\ndessert, to the ever hungry mind.\r\n\r\nThe magazines will be remembered as among the very best the country\r\nafforded at that time. But things that do not grow with the country’s\r\ngrowth are soon outgrown in the day of steam and lightning.\r\n\r\nThe boy who read those periodicals then has not been outgrown, but\r\nhe has outgrown much that then caused him to grow. They constituted\r\nthe chief part of polite literature, as it was called, of that form,\r\nand helped in the culturing process which has resulted in harvests so\r\nabundant.\r\n\r\nCan we imagine the deep joy and satisfaction of that mere boy of ten\r\nyears at the election of General Harrison, for whom he had cheered a\r\nhundred times? And when he came through on his way to Washington, to be\r\ninaugurated president, he stayed over night at Brownsville, just across\r\nthe bridge over the river, and James was presented to him.\r\n\r\nNo camera obscura ever photographed a face so distinctly, and no\r\ncurious eyes ever took in the details of the scene more perfectly.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the two lady teachers who bore a part in the early\r\neducation of James Blaine, there are four men who held a conspicuous\r\nplace as instructors in the neighboring country school he attended, and\r\nwho are remembered with gratitude to-day. These are Albert G. Booth,\r\nJoshua V. Gibbons, Solomon Phillips, and Campbell Beall. Mr. Booth is\r\nstill living, and has doubtless rejoiced many times that he did his\r\nfoundation work so well.\r\n\r\nMr. Booth was one of those patient, careful, devoted workers who do\r\ngood, honest work.\r\n\r\nJoshua V. Gibbons bore a striking likeness to Abraham Lincoln. When\r\nan old man, he visited Mr. Blaine in Congress, at the time he was\r\nSpeaker of the House. Mr. Blaine invited him to a seat beside him, in\r\nthe Speaker’s desk. It was a worthy honor to a noble teacher, a moment\r\nof thrilling interest to the great national assembly, and attracted\r\nuniversal attention.\r\n\r\nMr. Gibbons was a man of heavy, strong mind, and forceful personality,\r\nand made himself deeply and strongly felt in the progress of young\r\nBlaine’s mental growth. He did solid, accurate, and enduring work.\r\n\r\nHomely people, as a general thing, have quite a fund of native\r\ngoodness, a sort of genial love and sympathy, to atone for physical\r\ndefects. Such seemed to be the case with the man who so resembled Mr.\r\nLincoln, and it drew all hearts to him. There was no rod or ruler\r\nin school so long as he taught, and no need of any. Such things are\r\ngenerally used in the school-room or family to supply deficiencies\r\nof wisdom, tact, and genuine ability. He simply won their love and\r\nrespect, and it was their joy to give it. He taught them, also, things\r\noutside of the books, and told them plenty of good, wholesome stories.\r\nOne day, in speaking about the heathen being away round on the other\r\nside of the world, he simply remarked,--“Of course you know the world\r\nis round,” but of course they did not.\r\n\r\nThe great eyes of James dilated, but he said nothing. He could not\r\nhelp thinking and taking a child’s view of it when school was out. It\r\ndid not hurt much to fall down four or five times as he went home that\r\nnight, with his eyes upturned toward the Heavens, and the great thought\r\nrevolving in his brain. The first question his mother heard was,--\r\n\r\n“Is this world round, anyhow, and how is it round?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my child,” and the old story of the ship was told, and he was\r\nexamining the picture in the atlas when his father came in, and _he_\r\nwas sounded and agreed with the assured fact of science; and that night\r\nwhen he went up the hill to grandfather’s house to recite Plutarch,\r\nfirst of all he asked,--\r\n\r\n“Grandpa, did you know this world was round?”\r\n\r\nGrandpa took him up in his great arms, and told him all about it, and\r\nshowing him through the window the great round haystack, on whose top\r\nand sides there was room for twenty boys like him without falling off,\r\nand how “the earth keeps turning around and around all the time, and a\r\ngreat power holds people on, just as the roots hold the trees, so no\r\none can fall off,--and the fact is, it is so big, and large, and round,\r\nand wide, they cannot fall off,” Jimmy thought he saw it and felt that\r\nit must be so.\r\n\r\nBut the next week when he went to Pittsburgh with Uncle Will, on the\r\nsteamer, he was looking all the way for proof that the world was round.\r\n\r\nBut what puzzled the boy fully as much, was the grave assertion, made\r\nwithout proof, that the sun does not move, when he knew that it did\r\nrise and set. Grandpa, and his parents, and Uncle Will, had to hold\r\ncourt every day until these questions were all settled, the testimony\r\nall in, and the dreams of the young learner reflected other scenes.\r\n\r\nHis youth had a great sorrow. No grandson was ever loved and petted and\r\ncared for and helped in a thousand ways as his Grandfather Gillespie\r\nhad helped and loved and cared for him. Though a man of affairs, and\r\ncarrying on business operations on a large scale and in distant parts,\r\nhe loved his home and all about him, and took special pride in this\r\nboy. The heart of James was truly won. It was his special joy to be\r\nup at grandfather’s. It was not the big red apple-tree, nor the great\r\nclock on the stairs, nor the old rusty sabre and flint-lock musket, and\r\nthe many relics of the Revolution that attracted him, but grandfather\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nBut grandfather did not get up, one morning, and the doctor was there,\r\nand nobody went to work, and there was general alarm. The delirium of\r\nfever was on him, but his strong constitution resisted its ravages of\r\ninward fire for days and weeks. Now he went there oftener, walked more\r\nsoftly, asked more eagerly. It all seemed so very strange. There was\r\nhis great chair vacant, and the hand that had so often lain on his head\r\nseemed void of touch and power now. Everything seemed to stop. Books\r\nhad nothing in them now; papers were unopened. The world grew darker\r\nand darker, until one black night, amid a terrific storm, word came\r\nthat grandfather had just died, and father and mother would not be home\r\nfor some time. The sun seemed to set to James, and he cried himself to\r\nsleep, while the other children bewailed their loss.\r\n\r\nThe morrow was bright and clear, but full of sadness, and as he looked\r\nupon the dear old man lying there, and felt his cold face and hand,--he\r\nhad never seen death before,--he was filled with wonder. The loss,\r\nindeed, was great to him. But his memory was an inspiration, and\r\nknowing what grandpa would have him do, he returned to his study with\r\nrenewed energy and to feel more than ever the worth and power of books\r\nthe departed one had prized so highly.\r\n\r\nSolomon Phillips was a Quaker and a farmer, but a man of strong,\r\npowerful intellect, honest as the day was long, painstaking and\r\npersevering. Mathematics were his special delight. It is a triumph\r\nof skill in teaching to love a hard, difficult science so as to get\r\nothers to love it, also. In this he succeeded. He felt its worth and\r\npower. He would divide 0 by 1 (zero by one), and get infinity, and sit\r\nand gaze out into its clear, white depths; and reversing the process he\r\nwould divide one by zero, and get the same result, and again gaze upon\r\nthe white depths of a world most beautiful to thought, in its clear,\r\nunclouded, not nothingness, but somethingness, and that something\r\ninfinity. He seemed almost to worship at the shrine of this kingly\r\nscience, and would tell again and again how brilliant and beautiful,\r\nand with what delightful accuracy, the labyrinths of the most gnarled\r\nand vexed problems opened to him.\r\n\r\nThis was the man to give Master James his great lift in preparation for\r\ncollege.\r\n\r\nHe followed promptly wherever the Quaker master led the way. Week after\r\nweek, and month after month, and term after term, the drill went on.\r\nThere were no bounds or limits then, as in academies now, so these\r\nwere passed as ships pass the equator, or railroad trains pass state\r\nor county lines. Hard study was the work of the hour, but hard study\r\nmade work easy, and this was the secret, of all his progress,--constant\r\nstudy brought constant victory.\r\n\r\nWhen his Grandfather Gillespie died, his father took up the drill in\r\nhistory, and Hume’s England was gone over carefully, beside Marshall’s\r\nLife of Washington and a volume of Macaulay’s Essays which he got hold\r\nof as a young boy.\r\n\r\nHis father had a fine, large library, in which he delved by day and\r\nnight, and aroused his son not only by example to constant application,\r\nbut also by persistent pressure. Here is the real key to that early\r\ncareer of youthful days so thoroughly utilized,--the father’s\r\nintelligent watchfulness, and careful method, and constant direction.\r\nOnly gauge the wheel to the stream, and the grist to the wheel, and\r\nthere will be no danger.\r\n\r\nThe father determined his son should be educated to the utmost, and\r\nplanned and wrought accordingly. No time was lost, and no undue haste\r\nmade; it was the persistency of constant pressure that won the day.\r\n\r\nHis boyhood was a happy, healthy period. He could swim across to\r\nBrownsville, discarding both ferry and bridge.\r\n\r\nHe went nutting with the boys, as is their wont when autumn days are\r\non the woods, and Nature, glorified with a thousand tints of foliage,\r\nis, in the poet’s sombre language, “in the sere and yellow leaf.” Black\r\nwalnuts, butternuts, shellbarks, hickory nuts, and chestnuts rewarded\r\ntheir search, and gladdened winter evenings with their cheer.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing unnatural about young Blaine. He was no prodigy; no\r\nmarvel, except of industry and constant training. He was simply a fair\r\nexhibition of what a good average boy, well endowed with pluck and\r\nbrains may become in the hands of good teachers, and under the guidance\r\nof intelligent love and the unyielding pressure of a strong paternal\r\nwill. What his Eulogy says of Garfield is equally true of himself:--“He\r\ncame of good stock on both sides;--none better, none braver, none\r\ntruer. There was in it an inheritance of courage, of manhood, and of\r\nimperishable love of liberty, of undying adherence to principle.”\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine could also speak of himself as “fifth in descent from those\r\nwho would not endure the oppression of the Stuarts,” and had fought\r\nunder Prince Charles in the affair of 1715 and 1723.\r\n\r\nSo satisfactory had been his progress thus far in the school, that the\r\nplan of his education involved, in 1841, sending him to Lancaster,\r\nOhio, where for one term he was in a school taught by a younger brother\r\nof Lord Lyons, so long our Minister from England, who according to\r\nEnglish law inherited nothing from his father’s estates, the eldest\r\nbrother receiving all; and so he made his home in the New World, and\r\nworthily engaged in training future presidents of the great Republic.\r\n\r\nDuring his term in Lancaster his home was in the family of Hon. Thos.\r\nEwing, his mother’s cousin. Mr. Ewing was a United States Senator when\r\nJames was born, and entered the Cabinet of President Harrison the\r\nyear before James’s appearance there as student, as Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, and in 1849 in Taylor’s Cabinet as Secretary of the Interior,\r\nboth of whom died soon after their inauguration. In 1849 Governor Ford\r\nappointed him to the Senate in the place of Hon. Thomas Corwin, who\r\nentered Fillmore’s Cabinet.\r\n\r\nThis first and only term of school away from home and out of that\r\nlittle country school-house in preparation for college, under the\r\nbroadening influences of such a home and the inspiration of such a\r\nteacher, was a long stride forward toward the desired goal. It was\r\na great journey in those days for a boy only eleven years old to\r\nmake, but it added another large chapter to his already wide range of\r\nknowledge and experience.\r\n\r\nThe other James, only a year younger, was living with his mother in\r\nthe woods of Orange, in the same state of Ohio, improving the modest\r\nprivileges of school, and maturing slowly, the winter James G. Blaine\r\nspent at Lancaster in the spacious home of that distant relative\r\nwho had enjoyed all the high honors of the government, next to the\r\npresidency.\r\n\r\nThese boys were probably not over one hundred miles apart that winter,\r\nand both at school,--investing more largely in themselves than in all\r\nbesides, using themselves as capital, their own powers and endowments.\r\nSurely no course is wiser, as their careers amply prove. It is\r\ngathering what is outside that one may get out what is inside, that is\r\nthe process of education; not getting what is outside regardless of\r\nwhat is within, that may be developed into treasures of transcendent\r\nworth, more valuable than the contents of forest and mine.\r\n\r\nAmerican history furnishes few examples of the practical value of\r\ncultivated brain more illustrious and potent than James A. Garfield and\r\nJames G. Blaine, and each the opposite in temperament and opportunity,\r\nbut both brought up on a farm, and both getting their first start up\r\nthe hill of knowledge in a country school.\r\n\r\nWhere are the two boys who, forty or fifty years from now, will take\r\nthe helm of state and guide the ponderous ship farther on her tireless\r\nvoyage?\r\n\r\nNo ever-recurring problem for the nation’s wisdom and the nation’s\r\nchoice, is greater than this one problem of presidents. It is the\r\nnation’s offer of greatness and renown to any boy who, through long\r\nyears of patient and persistent endeavor, will seek full and honorable\r\npreparation for the prize she proffers.\r\n\r\nThe brief stay at Lancaster was soon over, and James once more\r\nharnessed into the old régime at home, with Campbell Beall for teacher,\r\nin the same old house that seven years before he entered, a boy of five\r\nyears old.\r\n\r\nIn one year he is to pass his examination to enter Washington and\r\nJefferson College, in the village of Washington, their shire-town of\r\nthree thousand inhabitants, twenty-four miles away. Will he be ready?\r\nMuch depends on Campbell Beall, much on his father, and much on himself.\r\n\r\nThe common English branches are well wrought over, languages and\r\nmathematics have come to be a delight, and in the old atmosphere, and\r\nthe old ways, with the old inspiration on him, progress comes anew.\r\nLines of reading from the library are kept up; the papers and magazines\r\nare not neglected; political matters are settled; bad news comes in\r\nfrom every quarter; Tyler is at the head of affairs; Ewing has sent\r\nin his scathing letter of resignation as Secretary of the Treasury,\r\ncharging him with violating every promise the Whig party made to the\r\npeople; but there is no campaign, no voting to be done, so the thing is\r\nsettled.\r\n\r\nMr. Beall proves a good teacher. The Latin begun at Lancaster is\r\nrenewed at home, and so the winter goes by. Time seems literally to\r\nbe alive and drifts like the snow as it goes rushing by. As Benj. F.\r\nTaylor has it:--\r\n\r\n  “How the winters are drifting like flakes of snow,\r\n    And the summers, like buds between;\r\n  And the year, in its sheaf, so they come and they go\r\n  On the river’s breast, with its ebb and its flow,\r\n    As it glides thro’ the shadow and sheen.”\r\n\r\nFather, mother, teacher, Uncle Will, all seem convinced that James can\r\npass and enter college; so, though only thirteen years of age, his\r\nfather takes him in the carriage, and they drive over to Washington.\r\n\r\nIt is a great experience for older heads, but for one so young, a\r\nveritable epoch in his history.\r\n\r\nIt does not take long to convince the president that he has drawn a\r\nprize, and he is entered with about forty other bright, smart boys, for\r\nthe Freshman class in the autumn. After three months of vacation, the\r\ngreat work is to begin in real earnest, and the stuff those boys are\r\nmade of is to be thoroughly tried and tested.\r\n\r\nThere was none of the hard, rough, and bitter experience in his boyhood\r\ndays and early manhood to which so many of our nation’s great men\r\nwere subjected. He had none of the long and desperate struggles with\r\npoverty and adversity which hung on Mr. Garfield’s early years. He knew\r\nnothing, by experience, of the privations and hardships through which\r\nMr. Lincoln came to the high honors of the nation and the world, but\r\nsprang from the second generation after the Revolutionary war, and from\r\na long line of ancestors who had been large land-owners and gentlemen,\r\nin the sense of wealth and education, as well as in that finely\r\ncultivated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nIN COLLEGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe summer of 1843 was bright with the anticipations of college life to\r\nthe eager boy. Manhood seemed dawning upon him, in all its glory. Since\r\nhis examinations, the great Dr. McConaughy had grasped his hand so\r\nkindly and drawn him to his side; then putting his arm around him had\r\nsaid, as he brushed the long, light hair from his forehead,--\r\n\r\n“You are a brave boy; I am glad to see you and know you. We shall have\r\na good place ready for you September third, and I shall be glad to see\r\nyou in my home.”\r\n\r\nThe president of Washington and Jefferson College could appreciate to\r\nthe full the fact before him, that this boy, without the aid of high\r\nschool or academy, was more than ready for the studies and honors of\r\ncollege.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WASHINGTON AND JEFFERSON COLLEGE]\r\n\r\nThe three months of summer were not lost. A general review was had,\r\nand particular attention paid to toning him up physically. He would\r\nplunge into the river and swim to his heart’s content; dash away on\r\nhorse-back for a good ride; go over to Brownsville, where they all did\r\ntheir trading, on errands, and regularly for the papers and magazines;\r\ngo on excursions up and down the river, and, withal, help in the field,\r\nespecially at harvest-time, and fill up regular hours with his best\r\nendeavors at study. So that he was not rusty and broken in habit,\r\nwhen September came; and it came very soon. His going to college was\r\nquite an event for the community. The neighbors took pride in it, for\r\nJames was greatly beloved. His exploits with books were known to all.\r\nTeachers had reported his progress and rejoiced in it.\r\n\r\nIt took a long while to say all the good-byes, but early Monday morning\r\nhe was off, and soon nicely settled in a good boarding-place, and when\r\nthe great bell rang out the beginning of new school-year, James G.\r\nBlaine was in his place taking in the situation in all its magnitude\r\nand interest.\r\n\r\nThere were one hundred and seventy-five scholars present, all boys and\r\nyoung men. There was a young ladies’ school, or seminary, in another\r\npart of the town, but they were entirely separated, and boys and girls\r\nwere not mingled together, as now in some of our colleges.\r\n\r\nJames devoted himself strictly to study, and retired promptly at ten\r\no’clock each night. He found himself in a large class of bright,\r\nenergetic students, full of pranks, jokes, and fun, but still boys of\r\nnerve, and pluck, and ample brain; boys who had been well fitted for\r\nthe task before them, many of them in the preparatory department of the\r\ninstitution itself, so that they were familiar with the place, and had\r\nknown each other for several years. They were not long in finding that\r\nthe new boy, who came from down near the big bridge, knew about Greek\r\nand Latin grammars, and could read without difficulty when his turn\r\ncame.\r\n\r\nHe did not have the town-boy sort of look that many of the others\r\nhad, but his good manners, and kind, easy ways made them feel and\r\nacknowledge that he was a little gentleman, anyhow. His mother had\r\nnever neglected her boy, and his father, being a professional man,\r\nknew the joy and worth of being a gentleman; and, if they had done but\r\nlittle, his grandfather had planted seeds of kindness in him enough to\r\nproduce a bountiful harvest. He moulded and shaped his ways and manners\r\nto the clear, strong model that was never wanting in the old Scottish\r\nclans and seems to remain in the very blood and very atmosphere of life\r\nand character.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing brusque or acrid about him. He took on and wore the\r\nair and atmosphere of the enlightened, quiet, and cultured home-life\r\nin which he was brought up. He was modest and retiring, there for\r\na purpose, and devoted to its accomplishment. It was not hard,\r\ndistasteful work to him, but a loved and longed-for opportunity. He\r\nhad no ills or aches to nurse, or trouble him. He felt greatly the\r\nabsence from home. But he was not off in Ohio now, only four and twenty\r\nmiles from old, familiar Indian Hill farm. But his books absorbed him;\r\nstudy roused and cheered him; competition electrified and nerved him.\r\nNothing would sting him like missing a question, or any petty failure.\r\nBut these were few and simple. He took first rank at once, and held it\r\nsteadily to the end.\r\n\r\nHis life at college was a comparatively quiet one. He never appeared\r\nupon a public exhibition, although he entered the societies, and took\r\npart in debates, read essays, contributed to the college paper, and\r\ndelivered orations.\r\n\r\nHe was rather retiring in his disposition, and sought rather to be a\r\nworshiper at the shrine of knowledge, than as is so often the case, be\r\nworshiped.\r\n\r\nThe quiet reticence and reserve referred to may strike some, owing to\r\ntheir knowledge of his dashing brilliancy of later years. But as a\r\nsurprise, the modest, unobtrusive habit was happily conducive to study,\r\nand served as a guard against many of the intrusions of a student’s\r\nlife. While kind and affable, he was not of the hail-fellow-well-met\r\norder. But he was not a recluse,--no monk with monkish ways. He was a\r\nstudent, through and through, and he loved study; it satisfied him and\r\nserved his aspirations.\r\n\r\nHe was a boy no longer; he had come to himself, to self-consciousness;\r\na consciousness of his powers, to a recognition of his own personal\r\nidentity. Manhood was fast coming on him; he was out of childhood. It\r\nwas a new world in thought to him, and life at college a new world\r\nin fact. He was respected and honored and trusted now, in a sense\r\ndifferent from being loved and petted and cared for at home. There\r\nwas not so much praise, but more power in it. He was on his own\r\nresponsibility now, and must rely largely upon his own resources.\r\nManliness was the needful quality. It was everywhere in demand. At\r\nstudy it was the prelude to victory; in the recitation-room it was\r\nthe well-poised harbinger of success, and in association with others\r\nit always won. This was just the quality that those who loved him had\r\nsought to develop in him, and they had not failed. He would take hold\r\nof the hardest task with a marvelous energy of resolve. His will was\r\na strong feature of his personality. It was an element of power that\r\nserved him now. He had reached a long-sought height and was pushing on.\r\n\r\nGood teachers are not long in finding good scholars in a new class.\r\nThey look for them as a miner watches for gold, and prize them as\r\nhighly. There was such a teacher in the faculty at Washington, and to\r\nProfessor Murray Mr. Blaine feels a deep and lasting debt of gratitude.\r\n\r\nLike all good teachers, he felt the dignity and power of his\r\nprofession. He could help the weakest into strength, and put a window\r\nin the darkest mind by his varied questionings, illustrations,\r\nsuggestions, and explanations. He was quiet, but forceful, genial, but\r\nsevere if laziness or wanton disregard showed its hydra head. In his\r\nown peculiar way, by virtue of an immense personality, he would light\r\nup and enthuse a whole class-room.\r\n\r\nThe Professor found in young Blaine a pupil to his mind, and James\r\nfound in the teacher just the man of his heart. He learned to love\r\nhim. A genuine teacher can incarnate himself in his pupils, just as\r\nNapoleon seemed to reproduce himself in his armies, firing them with\r\nhis spirit, arming them with his purpose, so that they would move with\r\nthe solid impetuosity of his own daring, scaling the Alps, triumphing\r\nat Austerlitz, until they came to look, and breathe, and act him out\r\nlong after; but Professor Murray was training men and citizens of the\r\ngreat Republic. His was a solemn, sacred work, of grave responsibility.\r\nIt was worthy of life and manhood’s strength and prime, as the great\r\nideals which burned in the heat of his glowing life fully assured him.\r\n\r\nTo sit in such a light, to dwell in such a presence, was to be lead\r\nover the fields of conquest by the hand of Alexander after he had\r\nconquered the world. No wonder this man is loved and honored, and his\r\nmemory cherished sacredly.\r\n\r\nOutside of the regular college course, Mr. Blaine read through the New\r\nTestament in Greek with him three times. This was a Sunday Bible-class\r\nexercise, and shows how deeply his mind became imbued with the truths\r\nof the Christian religion, which have since made him a devoted member\r\nof the Congregational Church in Augusta, Maine.\r\n\r\nJames was no book-worm in college. He was a severe, close student. This\r\nwas his chief business there. He was on his honor, and loved his work,\r\nand so did it well.\r\n\r\nProf. E. B. Neely, superintendent of schools in St. Joseph, Mo., an old\r\nclass-mate, says of him:--\r\n\r\n“James G. Blaine was always looked up to as a leader, by his\r\nclass-mates, being universally recognized as such. While a close\r\nstudent, he was genial in his habits, and decidedly popular with all,\r\nbeing the very reverse of what is known as a book-worm.”\r\n\r\nThis is just what those who know him now have reason to expect was\r\nthe case, and yet it is very remarkable, from the fact that he was\r\nseventeen and a half years of age when he graduated, and in a large\r\nclass of thirty-three, seventeen of whom entered the Christian ministry.\r\n\r\nAt the end he was one of those to divide the honors of his class, and\r\nhere again we are indebted to Professor Neely.\r\n\r\n“Third, by reference to my class-book you will see that at the time\r\nhe graduated Mr. Blaine was given the second of the three honors of\r\nthe occasion. The first, the Latin salutatory, was delivered by Jno.\r\nC. Hervey, of Virginia; the second, English salutatory, by James G.\r\nBlaine, of Pennsylvania; and the third, Greek salutatory, by T. W.\r\nPorter, of Pennsylvania.”\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Blaine graduated he delivered a masterly oration, most of\r\nwhich he can speak to-day, after a lapse of thirty-seven years. The\r\nsubject was,--“The Rights and Duties of American Citizens.” How fitting\r\nsuch a theme for such a man, and how admirably it shows his trend of\r\nmind!\r\n\r\nDuring his course at college, in 1844, occurred the great campaign of\r\nHenry Clay. It had been Mr. Blaine’s privilege to meet Mr. Clay, and\r\nhe took the liveliest interest conceivable in the contest. He was a\r\nvery positive man, decided and aggressive, especially in his political\r\nopinions. Of course the great question of the day was debated in the\r\ncollege-society, and Mr. Blaine was on hand. He usually was on such\r\noccasions, and had a large part in the discussion. He was so well read\r\nin the history of the country and of parties, had entered so into the\r\nmerits of the campaign of General Harrison, four years before, that\r\nwith all his growth and acquisitions since, he was well qualified to\r\ntake his position and maintain it against all who chose a tilt with\r\nhim. His was the force of accumulated strength, the weight of reserved\r\npower. He was so full of his subject, that it seemed to require no\r\neffort to bring out the facts and figures and formulate the arguments\r\nthat demolished his antagonist. He joined, as if by instinct, the fresh\r\nyoung Whig party of progress and of power. Clay was their idol, and\r\nthis was the hour of his destiny. No young life was ever given with\r\nmore ardent devotion to any cause than did the young collegian give\r\nheart and thought, sympathy and endeavor, to the star so surely rising.\r\nHe lead in the fight among the boys, and won the day; and wherever\r\nvoice or influence could reach, he energized others with the wholesome\r\ntruths of political equity, justice, and common sense that filled\r\nhis soul. No wonder his theme on Commencement day was so near the\r\nnation’s life. It was near his heart, and so his first great triumph\r\nwas celebrated by considering, back in those times of the slave-power,\r\n_Rights and Duties of American Citizenship_.\r\n\r\nWashington and Jefferson College was famous in those days for sending\r\nforth great men. It was a great institution of the times. Indeed,\r\nit was two colleges united. Jefferson College had been located at\r\nConnersburgh, some four miles distant, and was merged into Washington\r\nCollege at Washington.\r\n\r\nThis gave increased advantage in picked teachers, fuller endowment,\r\nlarger classes, and better appliances. To go to such an institution, a\r\nmere boy and a total stranger, and take the lead and keep it through\r\nhis entire course, argues for the mental power and furnishing of the\r\nboy, as well as his other qualities of heart and character. He led his\r\nclass in mathematics, as a fellow-student testifies, and thus showed\r\nthe unabated influence of his old Quaker teacher, Solomon Phillips.\r\n\r\nThe college-library was a great resort for him, a sort of second home.\r\nHere he could delve, with no thought of time or weariness. It was his\r\ndelight and joy. Books seemed a part of him; he was seldom without\r\nthem, and yet he utilized, by good mental digestion and strong powers\r\nof assimilation, the substance of what he read. He ranged over a wide\r\nfield, principally of English works then, as works of American authors\r\nwere comparatively few. Indeed, it is only within the last quarter of a\r\ncentury the sneer, “Who reads an American book?” has ceased to sting.\r\nVacation was his busiest time with books. He was never empty, but\r\nalways full.\r\n\r\nBut all his study and meditation; all his reading, thought, and\r\nobservation; all he had gleaned, gathered, and garnered from books,\r\nteachings, and associations; all that had come to him from newspapers,\r\nperiodicals, travel, great men, found their fitting and powerful\r\nculmination in the great oration he delivered on Commencement day,\r\nin June, 1847. It was sound and convincing, patriotic and manly, and\r\nwould do credit to any graduate to-day, though twice his age. It was\r\nthe key-note of a life-long career, which has ever since been urging in\r\na most potent way the rights, and discharging the duties of American\r\ncitizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nTEACHING IN KENTUCKY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe world opened grandly to young Blaine at his graduation. His college\r\ncourse had been a triumph, his reception home an ovation. The heart of\r\nthe great class beat with his; their hopes were justly high, and high\r\nespecially for him whom they had learned to love and honor. His power\r\nto make friends and hold them was remarkable. Those who knew him best\r\nloved him most.\r\n\r\nOne who knew so much of the world must see some of it, and as yet he\r\nhad traveled but little; but a good rest is taken, and the summer spent\r\nat home. Old, familiar scenes are viewed through larger eyes. Books are\r\nreviewed, fresh volumes read; the news, home and foreign, is seized\r\nwith a new avidity by one whose business of life is just beginning. As\r\nyet, though, he has not been earning money, he has gained something he\r\ncan never lose, and that can never be stolen or borrowed from him. It\r\nis his fortune; his father’s wise plan has been carried out, and he\r\nis ready for business now. A call comes for a teacher in Blue Licks\r\nMilitary Academy, at Georgetown, Kentucky, and he is selected and\r\nrecommended by the faculty for the place. He has never taught an hour.\r\nShall he go? He knows enough, has good command of himself, and from\r\ncareful observation, a fair knowledge of methods. He believes he can do\r\nit, for, as yet, he has never failed, and has always been able to make\r\nhimself understood, whether in private conversations and discussions,\r\nor society debates in college.\r\n\r\nThe question is decided. He is to receive a salary of five hundred\r\ndollars a year, while boys of his age are working for eight and ten\r\ndollars a month. It is a man’s work. He is to start September first,\r\nand he will not be eighteen years old until January. There is not a\r\nhair on his face. But there is a man within, strong in manly powers,\r\nand rich in stores of knowledge.\r\n\r\nHe had a fine address, clear and strong of speech, large lustrous eyes,\r\nfine conversational powers, and in all respects, of good appearance.\r\nHis youth was in his favor, since it made his accomplishments all the\r\nmore marvelous. He had been well written up and highly recommended\r\nbefore going, so that anticipations were high on both sides.\r\n\r\nIt was harder than ever to say good-bye, especially for mother and\r\nson, but it must be done. They recalled the time when their ancestors\r\nleft native land across the seas, to come to this country, and were\r\nreconciled. His father and Uncle Will tried the name of Professor\r\non him before he started, and it seemed to fit, though at first it\r\nstartled him. It weighed him down with the gravity of his position, and\r\ndrove the last remnant of pedantry from him. He declined a tall hat and\r\ndiscarded a cane. He was simple, genuine, and true, and went for just\r\nwhat he was worth.\r\n\r\nThe trip to Pittsburgh, and down the river to Louisville, and out to\r\nGeorgetown by public conveyance, was full of interest to him, because\r\nit was his country he was seeing. A steam-boat explosion, and talk of\r\nan insurrection among the negroes, made him a little nervous. But the\r\nfact that he was going to the state of Henry Clay, gave him a sort of\r\nhome feeling, and made him feel they were his sort of folks, and then\r\nsome of the students were from down that way, and he had met several of\r\nthe public men from Kentucky, besides Mr. Clay.\r\n\r\nThere happened to be an old Jacksonian Democrat in the stage-coach,\r\nwho had been attracted to the young professor by his manly bearing,\r\nhis quiet urbanity, which cost him no effort, and especially by his\r\npoliteness in giving a lady from the Blue Grass region a back seat,\r\ninsisting “that she take it” in a most gentlemanly manner, while he\r\ntook a far less comfortable one, riding backward. This brought him face\r\nto face with a full-blooded Kentuckian of the old type.\r\n\r\n“You are a native of the soil, I take it, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, but not of this state.”\r\n\r\n“Of what state, may I ask?”\r\n\r\n“The Keystone state of Pennsylvania, sir,” with a suppressed air of\r\npride.\r\n\r\n“Indeed, then you are from the North?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Clay has a good many friends up there, has he not?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, a great many.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it was an awful whipping he got.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and he did not deserve it.”\r\n\r\n“Didn’t deserve it?”\r\n\r\n“I think not; he is a royal man, and would have made an excellent\r\npresident, in my judgment.”\r\n\r\n“If he had not been a Whig; that spoils him. Strange how much good and\r\nsmartness a man may have, and not have good sense.”\r\n\r\n“But he has good sense, in my judgment, if you will pardon me.”\r\n\r\n“Young man, slavery is a Divine institution. That is fixed; the Bible\r\ndecides that!”\r\n\r\nThese words were said with great emphasis.\r\n\r\n“Then what of the Declaration of Independence; does that conflict with\r\nthe Bible? Is that a Divine institution?”\r\n\r\nThe man was puzzled, but finally said,--\r\n\r\n“Well, the Bible don’t have to agree with everything.”\r\n\r\nJames had just finished the study of the Constitution, of Political\r\nEconomy, of Moral Science, was thoroughly posted regarding political\r\nparties and all the great questions of the day, and slavery had a\r\nblack, villanous look to him. Some of the sights he had witnessed had\r\nroused his blood, and taking it altogether he was ready for quite a\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nHe had never been placed under any particular restraint, but had\r\ntalked right out the best he knew how, and so followed the person\r\nup who encountered him pretty closely, until the questions were all\r\nanswered to their satisfaction, and a few difficult ones asked to\r\nhis satisfaction. But when the identical lady whom he had favored\r\nwith a seat, asked right out,--“Would you marry a nigger?” he seemed\r\nlifted from his moorings all at once, and replied almost instantly,\r\nwithout inspecting his words,--“No, ma’am, would you?” A fair amount\r\nof indignation was in the air, without any perceptible delay, and\r\nsundry epithets, so common in those days, such as “nigger-lover,”\r\n“nigger-stealer,” and “black abolitionist,” found expression. James’\r\nonly apology was,--\r\n\r\n“Madame, I only asked you the very respectful and lady-like question\r\nyou had so kindly asked me.”\r\n\r\n“I admire your courage and independence of character, sir,” said a\r\nyoung lady opposite, with some warmth, who, though rather large, and\r\nwith a look of rare intelligence, and a voice of peculiar sweetness and\r\nvolume, was evidently still in her teens,--possibly sweet sixteen, in\r\nits fullest glory.\r\n\r\nThe driver stopped at the foot of a big hill, and, as was their\r\nprivilege, several passengers got out to walk up the hill. James was\r\namong their number. It was a real relief to be in the open air.\r\n\r\n“Give us your hand, young man,” said a fellow-passenger, as the stage\r\npassed on. “I like yer pluck; brains is good, but it ain’t much without\r\npluck. I tell you, you sot the truth right home that time. You are\r\na right smart kind of a boy. Do they raise meny sich up in the old\r\nKeystone or Yellowstone--What did you call it? I reckon that that\r\nMissis was right down put out when you axed her what she axed you.\r\nBut, then, they do say a heap of jokers don’t like to be joked. But my\r\nrule is, tit-for-tat. I tell you, a little nip and tuck now and then\r\nis a mighty edicating sort of thing, and I guess you’ve been educated,\r\nhaven’t you?”\r\n\r\nJames shook hands and followed up the conversation until the top of the\r\nhill was reached.\r\n\r\nAll had a good dinner, and felt better.\r\n\r\nIt was a simple act of courtesy which the occasion demanded, to help\r\nthe young lady of sixteen, more or less, from the coach, as she was\r\nready to step out after James had alighted, and as she thanked him very\r\ngraciously he could but offer to escort her to the table, and with rare\r\ngood grace she assented.\r\n\r\nJames had done such things before, and done them very handsomely, in\r\nconnection with their college-exhibitions and socials in the town, to\r\nwhich he occasionally went.\r\n\r\nKentucky is a great country for quail, and the colored cook had broiled\r\nand buttered them that day exactly to the taste of an epicurean. They\r\nwere simply delicious, and just in season. They enjoyed them hugely,\r\nand chatted with the cheer and gusto of old friends, mostly speaking\r\nof the glories of the North, in which they perfectly agreed, and upon\r\ntheir homes. “One touch of nature makes the whole world kin” may be\r\ntrue or not, but that little touch of nature in the stage-coach had\r\nmade them kin.\r\n\r\nAnother fresh brace of the savory quails had just been placed before\r\nthem, when the coach dashed around to the door, and the lusty voice of\r\nthe driver crying “All aboard!” resounded through the hall and open\r\ndoor of the dining-room.\r\n\r\nThere was no alternative, so without delay they resumed their old\r\nseats, and conversation was discontinued.\r\n\r\nThe political status of the company had been pretty well defined, and\r\nJames had made two friends, the names of neither of whom, however, he\r\nhad learned.\r\n\r\nThere was a lull in the conversation, and James was going over his\r\nscheme of study and recitations for the twentieth time, when at three\r\no’clock Georgetown was announced. He bade his two friends good-bye, and\r\nexpressed the hope that all would enjoy their journey.\r\n\r\nThe stage had but just started, when the old Jacksonian said, “I dunno\r\nbut the boy is more n’r half right, anyhow.” The young lady knew he\r\nwas, but the lady number one did not know about it.\r\n\r\n“Well, it’s mighty sartin the Declaration is agin’ Slavery, and the\r\nBible can’t stand up for both, nohow,” said the man who walked up the\r\nhill with James.\r\n\r\nJames was now in his lodgings, and liked the looks of things. He had\r\njust brushed and dusted up when he heard the tap of a drum, and looking\r\nout he saw a line of cadets forming, and ascertaining that that was\r\nthe academy, he walked over and saw one hundred and fifty fine-looking\r\nyoung men, handsomely uniformed, each with a musket, marching to music\r\nof fife and drum. They stood erect and stepped together. It was a fine\r\nsight to him. They went through the evolutions, marked time, marched,\r\nand countermarched.\r\n\r\nThe entire faculty were present. He ventured in, and soon heard a\r\nmessenger announce that Mr. Blaine had come, but he had missed him.\r\nHe simply said, “I am Mr. Blaine,” and the Principal grasped his hand\r\nwith evident delight, placing his left hand upon his shoulder and\r\nsaying, “I am glad to see you, Mr. Blaine,” and introduced him to the\r\nother teachers, and then turning to the students he said, “Battalion,\r\npermit me to present to you our new professor, James G. Blaine, of\r\nWashington, Pennsylvania; you will please receive him at present\r\narms”; instinctively Mr. Blaine removed his hat in recognition of his\r\nreception. “Perhaps you have a word for the boys,” said the Principal,\r\nand the battalion was brought to a “shoulder arms,” an “order arms,”\r\nand then to a “parade rest,” when, stepping forward, he said,--“I\r\nam glad to see you, gentlemen, in such fine form and spirit, and so\r\naccomplished at your drill, for I watched you several moments yonder,\r\nunobserved. We had nothing of this kind where I studied, but I think\r\nit must be a fine thing for you. I hope you will never be needed in\r\nyour country’s service, though it does begin to look a little as though\r\nthere might possibly be war with Mexico. But as I have been nearly two\r\nweeks on my journey, and as we shall have ample time to get acquainted,\r\nI will not detain you longer.”\r\n\r\nThree cheers were proposed for Professor Blaine, and given with a will.\r\nThe Professor was the lion of the hour.\r\n\r\nThe Principal said, “You will take tea with me, Professor Blaine?”\r\n\r\n“With great pleasure.”\r\n\r\nAnd to the other professors, “You will please take tea with Professor\r\nBlaine, at my house.”\r\n\r\nThe hour spent in the study with the Principal was not without a\r\npurpose on his part. It confirmed all that Doctor McConaughy and\r\nProfessor Murray had written about him, and afforded certain knowledge\r\nthat they had drawn a prize. By an adroit, yet careless method of\r\nconversation, introducing a general discussion of the textbooks of\r\nthe day, with their general contents, their defects and excellences,\r\nthe great knowledge of the new man was made evident, and it was not\r\nrestricted to the mere curriculum of studies.\r\n\r\n“Surely,” thought he, “I am in for it now in earnest,” as he was left\r\nalone for a few moments while his host went down to receive his other\r\nguests.\r\n\r\nThere was not a soul within three hundred miles who would think of\r\ncalling him Jim Blaine, or Jimmy, nor dare to, if by some strange,\r\nunnatural process it did occur to him.\r\n\r\nHe was treated, respected, and honored as a man and a scholar. The\r\nworld had opened to him, and he had entered. It was well there was no\r\nshow or shoddy about him, and he knew it. The stamp of the mint was on\r\nhim, and he passed at par, with the ring of honest coin.\r\n\r\nThere is a power in some men to meet any emergency when it is fairly\r\non them. They rise with the tide, become a part of the occasion, and\r\nadjust themselves to it with a quiet dignity. He had this power, and\r\nfelt it on him now. As he was going down-stairs to be presented to the\r\nladies, he said to himself, as he threw back his hair with a quick,\r\ndecided toss, “No politics to-night”; and this prolific subject was\r\nmentally abjured.\r\n\r\nThey received him as an equal, spoke of the favorable opinion they all\r\nentertained of him, and the joy his coming had given them.\r\n\r\nHe thanked them, and spoke of the pleasure he experienced in coming to\r\na state so great in the nation’s life.\r\n\r\nIt was a matter of conscience with Professor Blaine to know where he\r\nwas going and where he had been, so that he had made his own state\r\nas well as that of Ohio where he had spent the term at school, and\r\nthe state of Kentucky, a special study; so that when they were fairly\r\nseated at table, and after repeated questions had been asked, he fairly\r\neclipsed all his former attempts at conversation, by the brilliancy of\r\nhis historical allusions, extending far back into colonial days.\r\n\r\nHe had learned, by his early drill in Plutarch’s Lives, where a brief\r\nbiography of a Roman and a Greek are alternately given, and then\r\ncomparisons and contrasts between them introduced, so to deal with\r\nstates and individuals. He had thus dealt with political parties and\r\ntheir leaders, but not to-night. This method helped him greatly.\r\n\r\nEvents, dates, names, places, fell into line and were marshalled like\r\ntroops just when the drum tapped, or the word of command was given.\r\nThey all seemed amazed; an hour passed by; material sufficient for\r\na half-dozen Fourth of July orations had been given. A veritable\r\npanorama of those three great states, three of the greatest in the\r\nUnion, seemed to march before them in sections and decades.\r\n\r\nThe members of the faculty, who understood very well what it was to\r\nknow and to talk, had some very complimentary things to say. He had won\r\nthem all, so unobtrusive was he, and entirely at his ease, withal.\r\n\r\nMonday morning, at nine o’clock, twenty-eight young men marched into\r\nthe school-room and faced him as their teacher, twelve of them older\r\nthan himself. They had taken his measure when on drill, and felt\r\nhonored to call him teacher.\r\n\r\nThey were from the best families of the state, were clad in bright\r\nuniforms, and sat erect. Mathematics was the first recitation. He\r\nlooked around almost instinctively for Solomon Phillips or Professor\r\nMurray, but they were not there. He was on the platform, not in the\r\nseats. He must lead off. A list of names had been furnished him. As he\r\nread them over, calling each name by itself, the scholar came forward\r\nand received a hearty shake of the hand, and was photographed at once\r\nin the mind of the teacher. This was the work of but a few minutes,\r\nyet it recognized each one of them, and made them feel acquainted. No\r\nother teacher had done this, but it was something they could tell of,\r\nwrite home about, and made them say,--“He is a fine man; I like him.”\r\n\r\nHe then told them many things about mathematics as a science, its power\r\nin intellectual development, and its great value in the practical\r\nbusiness of life; its place in astronomy and engineering, in naval and\r\nmilitary operations, and the certainty with which it assures the mind.\r\n\r\nIt was a simple, quiet talk, illustrated in various ways by references\r\nto the book and the sciences spoken of. He thus drew them nearer to\r\nhimself, and removed the dread with which so many approach the vexed\r\nsubject of mathematics. This class was in algebra, on at cube root,\r\ndoing pretty solid work. The ground was familiar to him. Problem after\r\nproblem had been performed; the whole class seemed roused to a new\r\ninterest, and in stepped the Principal, but the work went on. Every\r\nblackboard was in use; it was a busy scene; there were no idlers there.\r\n\r\n“Never touch a problem hereafter,” he said, “unless you are certain you\r\nhave the rule fixed in your minds. Do not forget this, and if you have\r\nthat clear, then ask yourself, in case of difficulty, ‘What axiom shall\r\nI use next?’ for you must keep using them, as you do the letters of the\r\nalphabet, over and over again.\r\n\r\n“One thing more: we are going to have hard, quick work done in this\r\nroom, and be sure now that every one gets ready for it, and we will\r\nhave a splendid time.”\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine’s resources had never been drawn on before in any real,\r\nbusiness-like way. But it was an experience he was ready for, and he\r\nliked it. He next had a class in Latin, and then in United States\r\nhistory. He could not have been better suited in studies. They were\r\njust the ones that delighted him. Christmas seemed to come that year on\r\nwings, and soon the spring-time was on them, and the picnic season.\r\n\r\nHe had shut himself up closely to his work. Visitors had abounded,\r\nbut he accepted but few of the invitations that were given. He did\r\nnot even accept any one of several invitations to spend the holidays\r\nwith students at their homes. A short trip to Lexington and Frankfort\r\nsatisfied, and he was back at work.\r\n\r\nThe literature of every subject connected with his recitations must he\r\nread up carefully, and every spare hour was devoted to these lines of\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\nBut he did go to the annual picnic. He was part of the school, and he\r\nmust go. Everybody went, seemingly. It was a sectional affair; other\r\nschools were there. He met a familiar face: it was a lady’s; who could\r\nit be?\r\n\r\nShe recognized him, and bowed. He returned it. He awoke as from a\r\nrevery, he had so lived in his work; and being worried with the\r\nquestion, “Where have I seen that face,” traced it at once to the\r\nstage-coach. They were introduced.\r\n\r\nIt was Miss Hattie Stanwood, of Augusta, Maine. She also was teaching\r\nschool, not far away. It was quite the thing in that day for\r\nwell-educated New England girls or young ladies to go South and teach\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nThey had remembered each other through the winter, but neither knew the\r\nother’s name, address, or occupation. Now all was clear. Thoughts and\r\ndreams were actualized. It was a marvel, almost a miracle, that they\r\nshould meet.\r\n\r\nThe picnic had no further charms for them. They quietly strolled away\r\ntogether over the hills after the lunch was served, and for three full\r\nhours they lived in each other’s lives. They seemed strangely near to\r\neach other, and a peculiar peaceful joy seemed living in their hearts.\r\nIt had evidently come to stay. None other ever seemed to be so needful\r\nto life itself. No formal words were spoken, only cards exchanged and\r\ncarefully preserved. In two weeks her school would close, and she\r\nwould spend the summer northward at her home, and he would take a long\r\ntrip southward through various states, and see what could be seen as\r\nfar down as New Orleans. They spent two afternoons in each other’s\r\ncompany before the time of departure came; correspondence was agreed\r\nupon, and in the autumn they would meet and renew acquaintance in the\r\nold posts of duty. Some slight tokens were exchanged, and as they must\r\nthey nerved brave hearts for a long and perilous separation.\r\n\r\nWhen the time for their departure came they were found seated side by\r\nside in the same old coach, for Louisville. The ride was much shorter\r\nand far more pleasant in that rich and beauteous spring-time than in\r\nthe ripe and luscious autumn before.\r\n\r\nPolitics was a barren subject now. Homes were admired as they passed\r\nalong; bits of sentiment indulged; snatches of song and lines of\r\npoetry; much sober, sensible talk filled in the hours which served as a\r\nneeded respite to minds kept hard at thought throughout the year.\r\n\r\nThe future loomed up, real and grand. Their lives took on a glow of\r\ninterest and earnestness of hope they never had known. There seemed to\r\nbe a reason in them now, before unseen. They felt their worth and knew\r\ntheir joy, as it was never felt or known before.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine took his southern trip, and made business of it. He knew the\r\nhistory of all that country, every state and town.\r\n\r\nIt had a vastly different look to him from any region of the North\r\nwhich he had visited. Slavery was the hideous monstrosity of evil\r\nthat met him everywhere. It was to him the great contradiction and\r\ncondemnation of the South.\r\n\r\nHe had heard and heard, but determined to see for himself, and see\r\nhe did. There was much that seemed pleasant in plantation-life,\r\nbut when he went to the slave-pens and the slave-auctions, and saw\r\nfamilies broken and sold asunder, and heard their cries, and saw the\r\nblows,--their only recognition,--his patriot-blood boiled fiercely in\r\nhis veins. It was enough. He sought his old home, and spent a happy\r\nmonth or more with its loved ones, those who rejoiced with him greatly\r\nover the achievements of the year.\r\n\r\nMiss Stanwood made her journey northward amid all the loveliness of\r\nNature, and arrived home far more the woman than when she left. Life\r\nwas more real and earnest now, and filled with larger hopes. She was\r\ncharmed with the South, and had strange longings to return. But letters\r\nare tell-tale things, for men, without any special reason, will write a\r\ngreat, bold hand.\r\n\r\nJames was able to lay two hundred dollars on the table on his return,\r\nand entertained them by the hour with stories of the South. He had seen\r\nmuch gambling and drinking, many bowie knives and revolvers, and seen\r\nmany splendid specimens of men.\r\n\r\nHe was filled with its beauties and glories, and with its generous,\r\nkindly hospitalities. It was a region so historic, so immense in\r\npossibilities, so alive and magnificent with the old ante-bellum\r\ngreatness, and splendor of cities and homes; so many graduates from\r\nYale and Harvard, which had been a dream of fame and greatness ever to\r\nhim; so many men of leisure, and, withal, so much to see; so much of\r\npleasing, thrilling interest; so much stir and life, that weeks passed\r\nby.\r\n\r\nHe spent parts of two winters in New Orleans. He was, in fact, a\r\nsouthern man for the time. His business was in the South, and his great\r\nsocial powers gave him friends and entrance everywhere.\r\n\r\nThe kind letters of his fellow-teachers,--Colonel Thorndike F. Johnson,\r\nthe principal of the Academy, and Colonel Bushrod Johnson, after of\r\nthe Confederate army,--gave him many pleasing acquaintances. This was\r\ntwelve or fourteen years before the war. The political business and\r\neducational interests of the country were a unit. There was no talk of\r\nrebels or of treason. The prominent men of the country, politically,\r\nwere largely from the South. The presidents had been selected largely\r\nfrom that section, and the political contests throughout were carried\r\non by parties whose strongholds were North and South. Only the summer\r\nbefore, President Polk had made a tour through the Middle and Eastern\r\nstates, going eastward as far as Portland, Maine, and was received with\r\nevery demonstration of respect. Nathan Clifford, of Maine, was his\r\nAttorney-general, and Mr. Bancroft, his Minister to England.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine’s father had moved to Washington, as he was prothonotary of\r\nthe courts, during his term at college, so that he had made his home\r\nwith them during some of these years, and the remainder of the time\r\nwith a Mrs. Acheson. He had ample opportunity to renew acquaintance\r\nwith old friends; with Prof. Wm. P. Aldrich, who had drilled him so\r\nfaithfully in mathematics: with Prof. Richard Henry Lee, grandson of\r\nRichard Henry Lee, of the Revolutionary war, who was his professor of\r\nrhetoric and belle-lettres; with his firm friend, Professor Murray,\r\nwho so inspired him in the study of the languages, and gave Mr. Blaine\r\na regular theological drill in the study of Greek, that most perfect\r\nreceptacle of human thought, in all its shades and vastness, even\r\nnow,--a language which took up Christ, his kingdom, and his mission,\r\nthoughts and doctrines, and perpetuated them for the world.\r\n\r\nNo drill is more highly intellectual, more conducive of fine taste,\r\ngood judgment, and accuracy, than the study of the Greek; and this he\r\nhad under the master-hand.\r\n\r\nTo Prof. Richard Henry Lee may be traced the training of power so\r\nbrilliantly displayed in Mr. Blaine’s forensic efforts and on the stump.\r\n\r\nTo renew acquaintance with these men, and a multitude of other friends,\r\nwas a part of his great pleasure. He was fresh and full as ever, taller\r\nby an inch, and larger every way. He no longer seemed to them a boy,\r\nbut had the air and manners of a man, and yet his laugh was as merry\r\nand hearty, his shake of the hand as vigorous and friendly as ever.\r\n\r\nThe sunny South shone full upon them in the fresh report he brought. It\r\nwas a goodly land, and he had made it a study, bringing to bear all his\r\npower of close observation.\r\n\r\nHe had taken his course at college principally for the sake of study,\r\nsimply, and the knowledge he gained; but the prominent thought in his\r\nmind had been journalism. This had not been his purpose in education,\r\nbut simply a chief idea in his mind rather than a chosen aim in\r\nlife. So that with this thought within him, and the habit of seeing\r\neverything on him, but little escaped the wide range of his vision\r\nduring his southern journeyings.\r\n\r\nOf course when home he did not ignore the old college-library. It was a\r\nresort so greatly loved, and almost sacred.\r\n\r\nBut when the hour struck he was eager to be off for his post of\r\nduty,--Kentucky. Promptness and despatch were ever elements of power\r\nwith him. He reached Georgetown ahead of time, and was rested and in\r\nreadiness when the new year of work began, and it was a year of hard,\r\nsteady, constant work with him. He not only had now a reputation to\r\nsustain, but to be greatly advanced. That a man stops growing when he\r\nis satisfied, was a thing perfectly understood by him. A man without\r\nambition is dead while he lives, and the one content to live with his\r\nhead over his shoulder may as well be turned into a pillar of salt.\r\nIt is the men who look ahead, and who look up who have a future. A\r\nbackward look is a downward look to them.\r\n\r\nCompetition was strong at the academy. Enthusiasm was great. Professor\r\nBlaine had done much to arouse it, but all unconsciously. He had\r\nheld steadily to his fixed habits of study, preparing carefully for\r\neach recitation himself, permitting no shams in his class-room. The\r\nmilitary discipline at the institution aided greatly its matter of\r\ndiscipline. Life and energy were everywhere manifest.\r\n\r\nAnd so the year passed with nothing special worthy of note, except\r\nthe amount of real work performed, and the large measure of success\r\nachieved.\r\n\r\nAcquaintance with his lady friend was early renewed and pleasantly\r\ncontinued. It had much to do with the inspiration of the present and\r\nin shaping his future. Of course it was kept a profound secret, and no\r\none in Kentucky permitted to know that they were aught to each other\r\nexcept chance friends, and indeed in point of formal fact they were not\r\nuntil near the close of the year, when the crisis came; but the young\r\nprofessor was a gallant knight, and had occasion required might readily\r\nhave performed some thrilling act of knighthood that would have set\r\nthe neighborhood agog, for none can doubt he had it in him even then.\r\nMilder methods have ever been his rule, except emergency arise, and\r\nthen he arises with it.\r\n\r\nIt is this ability of abilities, this almost perfection of powers,\r\nthat has made him equal to every occasion, however dire or desperate\r\nopposition may have been; that has given him his great prominence in\r\njournalism, in halls of legislature, both of state and nation, and\r\nin the field of politics. But he has had this mountain-peak of power\r\nbecause beneath and back of it lay a long mountain-range of endeavor,\r\ncapacity, and growth.\r\n\r\nThe patient, hard, honest toil of years has ever and anon had its\r\nculmination in hours of splendid victory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nA NEW FIELD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe years at Georgetown reviewed and solidified the work of his student\r\nscholarly life thus far, beside carrying him forward to new fields of\r\nconquest. Courtship could not interfere with study and with work, and\r\nit did not.\r\n\r\nThis new relationship had changed somewhat the plan of life. Other\r\nyears could be but a repetition of the two now nearly passed, so that\r\nwhile he was in the line of promotion and in a place to grow, it was\r\nnot just the thing, so he relinquished his professorship and went\r\nnorthward.\r\n\r\nThese years had been eventful in the history of the country. The\r\nMexican war had been fought, and General Taylor, its hero, elected and\r\ninaugurated president. Both were triumphs of the Slave-Power.\r\n\r\nPresident Polk had taken part in the ceremonies attendant upon the\r\ninauguration of General Taylor, and gone to his home in Tennessee by\r\nway of Richmond, Charleston, and New Orleans, only to die on the 15th\r\nof June, 1849, in the fifty-fourth year of his age.\r\n\r\nThe cholera was raging in the South “like a desolating blast. It swept\r\nover the valley of the Mississippi, carrying off thousands with the\r\nsuddenness of the plagues of the old world.” The South was surely no\r\nplace for northerners at such a time.\r\n\r\nThe great gold-fever of California was on the country, and scores\r\nwere hurrying to the Pacific coast. But Mr. Blaine had no taste for\r\nadventure,--no thirst for gold. He was a man of books and a man of\r\naffairs, profoundly interested in all that pertained to the country,\r\nbut too young as yet either to hold office or vote.\r\n\r\nHe took his last winter’s journey to the South, and returned home to\r\nfind his father near his end, at the age of fifty-five years.\r\n\r\nJames was now twenty years old, and the pressure of new\r\nresponsibilities was on him. His attention is turned to business\r\nmatters, and he displays the same capacity and aptitude which in fuller\r\npower have characterized him.\r\n\r\nHe early became impressed with the extent and richness of the great\r\ncoal-fields of Pennsylvania, and before he was thirty years of age made\r\nthose investments which have so enriched him in later years.\r\n\r\nIt is the part of wisdom and sagacity in men to make the most of their\r\nfirst years, or the first half of life. This is an eminent feature in\r\nthe career of Mr. Blaine. There are no wasted years in his life; no\r\nbaneful habits to destroy his energies or dry up the fountain of his\r\njoys. He is a clean, strong, vigorous man, and is able to celebrate the\r\nyear of his majority with a more extensive preparation and experience\r\nas scholar, teacher, traveler, and man of business, and a brighter\r\noutlook for life, than falls to the lot of many young Americans.\r\n\r\nIn this year of 1851 transpired the event more propitious than any\r\nother. It was his marriage, at Pittsburgh, to Miss Hattie Stanwood, the\r\npresent Mrs. Blaine, a lady of fine culture and rare good sense, who\r\nloves her home with the devotion of a true wife and noble mother.\r\n\r\nIt would require the sagacity of a sage to have predicted the future of\r\nMr. Blaine, had it not been his kindly fortune to have his life crowned\r\nwith so much of goodness, wisdom, intelligence, and love, as is found\r\nin the companion of his honors and joys.\r\n\r\nSix children, now living, have come in these years to honor their\r\nwedded life;--a goodly family indeed.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps not unworthy of remark that during an entire century of\r\nthe nation’s life, but one old bachelor was ever elected president, and\r\nhe the last resort of an expiring Democracy.\r\n\r\nFrom 1852 to 1854 Mr. Blaine was principal teacher in the Institution\r\nfor the Blind at Philadelphia, meanwhile reading law in the office\r\nof Theodore Cuyler, who became a leading lawyer in that famed city,\r\neminent for the greatness of the members of its bar.\r\n\r\nThese quiet years of reading and study and teaching in a great degree\r\nfitted Mr. Blaine for his career as a statesman.\r\n\r\nHe fitted himself for admission to the bar, but never committed himself\r\nto the practice of the profession by assuming its functions. The love\r\nof journalism would not die. It was in his heart. The time had come to\r\ngive it light and opportunity. Often had the attractions of the Pine\r\nTree state been presented to him by Mrs. Blaine in all the glowing\r\ncolors with which youth is accustomed to paint the scenes that lie near\r\nits heart. No state had the charms for her possessed by the state of\r\nMaine. Here she was born, and here those dearest to her resided.\r\n\r\nAs yet they had not settled down for life. The time had come for their\r\ndecision. Her powers of argument, and its very eloquence of oratory,\r\nwithout aught of noise and gesture, but of simple and quiet way, were\r\nbrought into requisition, and it was decided not to go west and grow up\r\nwith the country, but go east and grow where greatness has its models.\r\n\r\nMaine has never wanted for great men; she had them then, she has them\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nIn 1854 Mr. Blaine removed with his family to Augusta, the capital city\r\nof Maine, where he has since resided.\r\n\r\nHe purchased, with Joseph Baker, the _Kennebec Journal_, founded in\r\n1823.\r\n\r\nNow, the political field could be reviewed and studied at will; the\r\npolitical arena was entered. The paper had been first started by a\r\nmeeting of the principal citizens to found a Republican paper, and such\r\nit was in real earnest. No longer the secluded life of the student, or\r\nthe quiet life of the teacher.\r\n\r\nEmbarking in journalism at such a time was like embarking on the sea,\r\nwhere storms and collisions abound; where icebergs show themselves, and\r\nrocks and reefs are found. No country has more political storms and\r\ncommotions, perhaps, than America. They are of all kinds and sizes,\r\nfrom city, town, county, up to state and national storms, and blows,\r\nhurricanes, and tempests. In those times of the slave oligarchy, they\r\nbeat with a fury unknown to-day. Sometimes they were fierce in their\r\ncruelty. It was a fight of great learning and profound convictions on\r\nboth sides, a fight of dearest principle and of Christian faith.\r\n\r\nPresident Taylor had died on the 9th of July, 1850, and Millard\r\nFillmore served out his term of office. March 4, 1853, Franklin Pierce,\r\nof New Hampshire, who, in 1846, had declined to be Attorney-general in\r\nPresident Polk’s cabinet; also an appointment of United States Senator\r\nby Governor Steele, and the Democratic nomination for Governor, but had\r\nplunged into the Mexican war and won his honors there, and who stood at\r\nthe head of the New Hampshire bar, was inaugurated President, and ruled\r\nthe nation when Mr. Blaine became an editor. He had a powerful cabinet,\r\nwho, of course, were among the prominent public men of the time.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Blaine entered political life, though not of his ilk, there\r\nwere William L. Marcy, of New York, Secretary of State; Robert\r\nM’Clelland, of Michigan, Secretary of the Interior; James Guthrie, of\r\nKentucky, Secretary of the Treasury; Jefferson Davis, of Mississippi,\r\nSecretary of War; James Dobbins, of North Carolina, Secretary of the\r\nNavy; Caleb Cushing, of Massachusetts, Attorney-general, and James\r\nCampbell, of Pennsylvania, Postmaster-general. Webster, Corwin, Stuart,\r\nConrad, Graham, Crittenden, and Hall had been in Mr. Fillmore’s\r\ncabinet. The time for Republican victory was drawing nigh, and the\r\nyoung editor was in position to help bring it on.\r\n\r\nIt was the centennial of the city’s history. The celebration was very\r\nbeautiful, an account of which appeared in Mr. Blaine’s paper, the\r\n_Kennebec Journal_, of July 6, 1854, and seemed auspicious of his\r\narrival in the city, and the inauguration of his work.\r\n\r\nAugusta is about midway between towns that boast two of the leading\r\ninstitutions of learning in the state, Colby University at Waterville,\r\nand Bowdoin College at Brunswick, where Longfellow graduated, and his\r\nclass-mate, Hon. James W. Bradbury, who was, about this time, United\r\nStates Senator from Maine, when the great men of the nation,--Webster,\r\nClay, Calhoun, Douglas, Cass, and others,--were discussing in the\r\nsenate the constitutional and slavery questions involved in the\r\ncompromise measures.\r\n\r\nIt was a time and place where great historic interests centered. It\r\nhad been the scene of grave military operations, a fort and outposts\r\non the nation’s frontier, less than a hundred years before, had been\r\nconspicuous in the French and Indian wars.\r\n\r\nThe mind of Blaine was not long, with his practical methods of historic\r\nresearch, in threading out lines of history, entering the labyrinths\r\nof knowledge of a mighty past, and a great and wondrous present,\r\nboxing the compass historically, as it were, until he knew the past and\r\npresent of his adopted state, and of New England, as he had known his\r\nnative state.\r\n\r\nHe came with no beat of drum and blare of trumpet, but quietly, with\r\nno parade or display, and went to work with good grace and strong\r\ndetermination. He brought his capital with him. It had not been\r\nembezzled, nor squandered, nor stolen. It was in a portable bank\r\nin which he had been depositing his investments, or investing his\r\ndeposits, steadily for nearly twenty years. Already he had drawn\r\ncompound interest, and yet, unlike air, water or money, the more\r\nhe drew, the more there was on deposit, bright and clear with the\r\npolish of the mint. He had invested in solid, reliable knowledge and\r\neducation. He had taken stock in James G. Blaine, taught and trained\r\nhim to think, to know, to talk, to write, and act. There is always a\r\ndemand for just such men. Communities want them, the state and nation\r\nwants them. From the distant South, explored and carefully surveyed and\r\nestimated, he had come to the farthermost North and East, and here for\r\nlife his home is to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nJOURNALISM.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not the policy of Mr. Blaine to undertake a work for which he\r\nwas not specially fitted. General adaptation and preparation were not\r\nenough; he must be master of the situation or not at all, so he did not\r\nsit down in the editorial chair at once. He was among a new people.\r\nHe must know them. His paper was published at the state capital. He\r\nmust know the state. He must know it politically, socially, morally,\r\neducationally, religiously. This required extensive travel. He must\r\nunderstand the demands of the people, their character and temperament.\r\n\r\nThe _Kennebec Journal_ had not yet risen to that standard of\r\ncirculation and of excellence, its position warranted and required. In\r\nthe words of one thoroughly conversant with its affairs, “The paper was\r\nbadly run down.” It was the opposition paper, and had long been what,\r\nin common parlance is known as “the under dog in the fight.” There\r\nwas the largest opportunity for the display of the new editor’s push\r\nand tact in business matters. To these two things, therefore,--public\r\nacquaintance and business affairs,--he gave himself until November,\r\n1854.\r\n\r\nAbout this time a turn came in the political tide, and William Pitt\r\nFessenden, “that good Whig,” was elected to the United States senate,\r\nrouting the Pillsbury Democracy. Governor Crosby and his council were\r\nalso Whigs.\r\n\r\nEverything of a political character seemed highly favorable for the\r\nbest editorial work, just as after the war the highest statesmanship\r\nwas requisite to garner and perpetuate its results, crystalize its\r\nvictories, and thus secure their glory untarnished.\r\n\r\nSo now conservatism, power, and radical might,--the one to hold, and\r\nthe other to defend what had been gained,--were needful. It did not\r\ntake long to catch the spirit of the hour. Mr. Blaine had been familiar\r\nwith the fight from boyhood, and in the great campaign of General\r\nHarrison had seen, upon a grander scale, a similar victory. Now he was\r\non the stage of action, in the responsibilities of life.\r\n\r\nHe had really entered the state in one of the happiest years,\r\npolitically, of her history. It was not until several years later that\r\nthe legislature of his old state of Pennsylvania defeated the express\r\nwish of President Buchanan upon this same issue, and sent Gen. Simon\r\nCameron to the senate in place of Mr. Buchanan’s selected candidate,\r\nJohn W. Forney. This, at the time, was said to be one of the most\r\nsevere blows his administration could receive.\r\n\r\nIn Maine it was the voice of the people against the nefarious attempt\r\nto fasten slavery upon the territories, and against the repeal of\r\nthe Missouri Compromise. Then the opponents of slavery were not\r\nall abolitionists. They were rather restrictionists. In an address\r\ndelivered by Henry Ward Beecher about this time, he makes these two\r\npoints,--\r\n\r\nFirst.--“We must hedge in slavery as far as possible.”\r\n\r\nSecond.--“Ameliorate the condition of the blacks to the extent of our\r\nability.”\r\n\r\nThere were, indeed, abolitionists then, red hot, just as there are\r\nprohibitionists now, and as events have proved, they were the vanguard\r\nof Vicksburg and Gettysburgh, where there were no compromises of the\r\nMissouri, or any other kind, and no Mason and Dixon’s line, but lines\r\nof battle. And in the one case the words “surrender of slaves,” written\r\nwith bayonets dipped in blood, and in the other, resounding from cannon\r\nand battle charge, the only alternative, “give in or go under.”\r\n\r\nBut the great political battles were being fought now, not to kill\r\nmen, but to save them, and to avert, if possible, the dread arbitrament\r\nof civil war with its consequences, more dire than pen could write\r\nor tongue could tell. It was a time for greatest wisdom and loftiest\r\ncourage.\r\n\r\nPolitical life was the life of a soldier, and the political field a\r\nfield of battle, as the assault upon Charles Sumner and Horace Greeley,\r\nat the nation’s capital testify.\r\n\r\nNo wonder the wise and prudent Pennsylvanian surveyed the field with\r\ngreat deliberation, and gained the fullest possible knowledge of the\r\nsituation ere he balanced his spear for its first lunge. It was but the\r\nputting on of his full armor ere the soldier enters the fray. It was no\r\nbusiness venture or financial investment merely, but rather the solemn\r\ndedication of himself to the nation’s weal.\r\n\r\nThen and there the public career begins that has brought him to this\r\nhour. It is a career of alternate wildest storm and serenest sunshine.\r\nThere were at this time, practically, four parties in Maine, and two\r\ngreat questions, both of them moral in character, namely: Temperance\r\nand Slavery. The Democratic party was split into two most radical\r\nsections, with slavery for their dividing line. Beside these were the\r\nWhigs and Liberalists.\r\n\r\nThe birth-hour of the Republican party was near at hand. The elements\r\nwere in existence demanding organization. Already men in sympathy with\r\neach other upon the great questions of the day in the different parties\r\nand divisions had acted together upon occasions of great political\r\nimportance, as in the election of Mr. Fessenden, an ardent Whig, to\r\nthe senate. Anti-slavery men, of the Democratic party, could and did\r\nvote for him. The nation demanded the man, somewhat as to-day she\r\ndemands another son of Maine. The _New York Tribune_, in an issue prior\r\nto his election, said,--“The nation wants him.” Not party names, but\r\nprinciples, ruled the hour.\r\n\r\nLess than ninety days after Mr. Blaine, quill in hand, made his bow\r\non the 10th of November, 1854, to the people of Augusta and to the\r\nstate of Maine, the Republican party was in existence, a full-fledged\r\norganization. Conventions had met a little earlier in Wisconsin and in\r\none of the counties of Maine for a similar purpose. Mr. Blaine was with\r\nthe movement, heart and soul. He was present at its birth, and rejoiced\r\nin its existence. It had come into existence full of life and power, as\r\nit had taken nearly all the life and power out of the other parties.\r\n\r\nIt had taken a minority of the Democrats, a majority of the Whigs, and\r\nall of the Anti-slavery or Liberty party. “Liberty national, Slavery\r\nsectional,” was upon its shield. No one, of course, stopped to ask, in\r\nthe rejoicing of the hour, how in the name of reason liberty could be\r\nnational and slavery sectional. But they were organized for victory,\r\nas right against wrong. How auspicious and full of promise that Mr.\r\nBlaine should celebrate the twenty-fifth year of his remarkable life by\r\nentrance with this party of progress and of power upon its marvelous\r\ncareer, himself an integral part of it, and a power within it.\r\n\r\nAbout this time John L. Stevens, a man of great good sense, takes\r\nMr. Baker’s place, a large law-practice demanding his attention, as\r\nco-editor of the _Journal_. But Mr. Stevens is so occupied with the\r\ndetails of party organization, that most of the editorial work at this\r\ntime falls to Mr. Blaine, and it shows great vigor and ability.\r\n\r\nOne who was associated with him intimately at this time, in\r\nprofessional life, speaks of him as “a man of great natural and\r\nacquired ability, and of adaptation, familiar with all questions of\r\ngovernment, with a remarkable facility for getting at the core of a\r\nquestion, a man of genius and talent to a striking degree”; and as we\r\nwent over year after year of editorials, some of them very striking\r\nand forceful in their headings, about the time the young party of great\r\nmen was fairly on its feet, and had become the target for rifle shots\r\nfrom the enemy, the old man turned, and with that peculiar emphasis\r\nwhich always comes with conviction of the truth, said, “He always\r\ncalculated to draw blood, if there was a tender spot.”\r\n\r\nHe invariably struck to demolish when fighting his great political\r\nbattles. There was no play about it, and none could doubt the moral\r\nearnestness of the man. It was a battle of great moral ideas with him\r\nall the way through.\r\n\r\nBut his work was more largely literary in conducting the paper. It\r\nwould be difficult to find more solid or instructive reading in any\r\npaper during those years. Mr. Blaine was himself a great reader of the\r\nbest journals and reviews, and with a high standard ever before him,\r\nnot only in his own ideals, but also in the great papers of the nation\r\nat his command, and having high aims and a mind whose rich stores were\r\nconstantly increased, and with all his varied powers of expression,\r\nbooks were reviewed, the substance of lectures given, and the best\r\nlecturers of the day entertained Augusta audiences, and a multitude of\r\narticles upon various subjects abounded.\r\n\r\nWithin fifty days after he became editor, the legislature met, and\r\nit devolved on him to gather in the substance of their speeches\r\nand addresses, and record the principal part of their doings. This\r\nbrought him into immediate and extensive acquaintance with members of\r\nthe senate, whose hall he chose to visit chiefly. They soon became\r\nacquainted with him, and saw and felt his power.\r\n\r\nHis life was stirring and active, and upon a scale quite in contrast\r\nwith the life of a recluse teaching in the Blind Institute in\r\nPhiladelphia, and quietly reading law only a year before.\r\n\r\nThough a man of strong impulse at times, it is intelligent, purposeful,\r\nand under such control that upon such occasions he has won his highest\r\npraise for brilliancy. He has made mistakes and blunders, and has had\r\nhis share of regrets and misgivings, giving ample proof that he is a\r\nmember of the human family.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine’s old foreman, who was afterwards proprietor of the paper,\r\nHoward Owen, says that he wrote most of his editorials at home, and\r\ncame down to the office to see his numerous friends, and that they\r\nwould have great times pounding for “copy” while he was entertaining\r\nhosts of friends in the office below. One who knows him well has\r\nwritten of him as a conversationalist.\r\n\r\nMr. Blame has few equals. He has a keen appreciation of fun, and can\r\ntell a story with a wonderful simplicity. There is no dragging prelude,\r\nno verbose details preceding a stupid finale; the story is presented\r\nalways dramatically, and fired almost as from a gun, when the point is\r\nreached.\r\n\r\nThe dinner-table in the Blaine house is the place where the gayest of\r\ngood-natured pleasantry rules. From six to eight the dinner speeds\r\nunder cover of running talk upon the incidents of the day.\r\n\r\nMr. Owen says that “when they came to ‘making up the form’ Mr. Blaine\r\nwould stand over him and attend to every detail, decide the location\r\nof every article, and give just that prominence that would produce the\r\nbest effect.” It showed the interest he took in the children of his own\r\nbrain, and the great activity of the man.\r\n\r\nHis force of intellect, strength of constitution, and great endurance\r\nhave been a marvel to many.\r\n\r\nHe has lived his life on a rising tide, amid immense prosperity, and\r\nthe great cheerfulness of temper thus produced has made life less a\r\ndrag and more a joy to him.\r\n\r\nHe struck the current at the start, caught at its flood that “tide in\r\nthe affairs of men that leads on to fortune.”\r\n\r\nHe got into the national drift of the new party and has kept it ever\r\nsince. It was like a splendid ship, all staunch and strong, launched\r\nat his hand; he sprang aboard, was soon at the helm, and has steadily\r\npassed along the line of honorable promotion.\r\n\r\nThere have been storms whose fury has been terrific; and there have\r\nbeen triumphs whose brightness has reflected the nation’s glory.\r\n\r\nThe paper improved in every way. They procured the state printing, and\r\nan increased circulation.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine’s pleasant home on Green Street, where most of his children\r\nwere born, was one of comfort and happiness.\r\n\r\nHe soon became a favorite in Augusta, and among the public men of the\r\nstate. People love to hear good things said well, and he never failed\r\nin this.\r\n\r\nHe soon appears on the Republican Central Committee. The party is\r\nvictorious from the start, and elects Anson P. Morrill Governor. Mr.\r\nMorrill is still living in Augusta, hale and hearty at eighty-one, a\r\ngreat reader, and soon after his nomination called upon Mr. Blaine to\r\ncongratulate him. The name of J. G. Blaine appears as chairman of the\r\nRepublican Central Committee soon after its organization, and the\r\nfollowing year he is presented as a candidate for the legislature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Residence of JAMES G. BLAINE, Augusta, Maine.]\r\n\r\nHe enters a city seventy-five years older than himself, rich with\r\nnumbers of strong men, but is taken up and speedily honored with a\r\nplace in the councils of the state.\r\n\r\nIt was an era of great and almost constant political conventions. The\r\nremnants of the Whig party and the Know-nothings kept up a struggle for\r\nexistence, but they were doomed, and failed to submit gracefully to the\r\ninevitable. They must be watched and won, if possible, to the new party\r\nof the future, whose substantial, steadfast principles,--as expressed\r\nby Mr. Blaine and his editorial colleague, Joseph Baker, in their\r\ninaugural,--were freedom, temperance, river and harbor improvement\r\nwithin constitutional limits, homesteads for freemen, and a just\r\nadministration of the public lands of the state and nation; and the\r\npresent testifies how well those principles, embracing all that were\r\nneedful then in a political party, have been carried out.\r\n\r\nThe words “Liberty” and “Freedom,” in Mr. Blaine’s paper always began\r\nwith capital letters.\r\n\r\nThe religious tone and character of the paper is worthy of note. It\r\nfurnished a column of “Religious Intelligence” each week. Many of its\r\nselected articles, notices of books, its correspondence, and even\r\neditorials, were deeply religious. The work of that time was solemn,\r\nserious business. There was much of the Puritan and Pilgrim in the\r\npeople then. There was a reliance upon God, a demand for his wisdom\r\nexpressed in prayer and song and sermon, that told that the importance\r\nand magnitude of the great principles at stake were fully appreciated.\r\nThere had been so much failure in the past, so many parties had been\r\norganized and proved inadequate, and still the encroachments of\r\nslavery, the nation’s foe, continued with an audacity unparalleled.\r\nAlready Kansas was conceded to the slave-power; secession was already\r\nin the air. The great war was only seven years in the future. A\r\nCharleston paper had stated the issue distinctly, “We must give up\r\nslavery or secede,” as it viewed the first contests and sweeping\r\nvictories of the new party. And Mr. Blaine, in a ringing editorial of\r\ncaustic power, quoting the entire paragraph, said, “This is the exact\r\nissue, squarely stated.”\r\n\r\nHis life in Kentucky and extensive winter trips through the South had\r\nbeen a revelation to him, and were now an inspiration. He knew what\r\nwas in the South, and he knew what was in the North, and he knew that\r\nthey could not keep house together for centuries, with slaves in the\r\ncountry, without quarreling. And, moreover, he knew that the destinies\r\nof the country could not be divided. She could not remain half slave\r\nand half free. The South itself was not satisfied with this, as all\r\ntheir measures of legislation at their various state capitals, and in\r\nWashington clearly indicated. Slavery must conquer or be conquered.\r\nBlaine saw it at that early day, as anyone may in the light of more\r\nrecent events.\r\n\r\nBut this was not the position or demand of the Republican party then.\r\nAnti-slavery did not mean abolition. In 1855 the Free Democratic party,\r\nas it was called, was achieving victories in the state of New York,\r\nand various phases of the great question were championed in different\r\nstates and sections, until the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860.\r\nAnd it was not until about two years of the war were gone, and it was\r\nimperatively demanded as a war-measure; not until it had been held\r\nback for months by the sagacious Lincoln, after it was written, that\r\nthe emancipation of the slave was proclaimed in states then in armed\r\nrebellion. But it was a fact fated and decreed, signed, sealed, and\r\ndelivered in a higher than earthly tribunal, long years before.\r\n\r\nThere are always high-wrought souls, keenly alive and sensitive to\r\nissues of the hour, who seem ordained to catch the foreshadowing of\r\nevents and report to others of duller and heavier mould. Mr. Blaine\r\nhad projected himself upon the future with the use of his princely\r\npersonal power, and with an eagle eye had read out the doom and destiny\r\nof that “peculiar institution” which violated the fundamental principle\r\nof the government, the great end for which it was established,--a doom\r\nwhich nothing could avert. God’s time for liberty had come, and chosen\r\nmen far out upon the frontier of human thought had watched its dawn and\r\nseen it mount the heavens.\r\n\r\nBut first, the shining of this same sun must produce a similar harvest\r\nof ideas, where the mists of a false and sophistical political\r\nphilosophy, and the fogs of a wrong and vicious science of government,\r\nand an unnatural and cruel selfishness and monopoly of liberty prevent\r\nthe cleanest vision, the fullest knowledge, and the most righteous\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nAt this time Mr. Blaine was closely and sharply following the course of\r\nthe Pro-slavery party. We give a single extract from his paper in 1855,\r\nas showing what facts the party had to stir its thought and fire its\r\nheart,--facts that read strangely in the light of to-day, and which had\r\na strange, ominous look even then.\r\n\r\n  “SLAVE TRADE--It is said that the business of fitting out slavers\r\n  is carried on extensively in New York. The _Commercial Advertiser_\r\n  believes the practice to be ‘alarmingly and disgracefully prevalent,’\r\n  and the _Tribune_ states, on good authority, that thirty vessels are\r\n  annually fitted out there, for the purpose of procuring slaves upon\r\n  the west coast of Africa.\r\n\r\n  “This is no more than following out the political creed of the\r\n  more advanced wing of the progressive pro-slavery Democracy. The\r\n  Charleston papers, which support President Pierce’s administration,\r\n  boldly advocate the re-opening of the African Slave Trade, with the\r\n  view of making ‘niggers’ cheaper. The ‘party’ in New England are not\r\n  as yet up to the work, but another Presidential election will _fetch_\r\n  them. _Progress_ is the distinct feature of the age.”\r\n\r\nSome are ready now with their verdict of principle, despite the mists\r\nand fogs and storms; yet not all. The party of Freedom organized in\r\ncounties and states all over the country, must be brought together,\r\nunified and organized as a great national party; a convention must be\r\nheld and all must be invited who can be induced to affiliate. It is a\r\npreliminary meeting, as it precedes the great organization. They want\r\nto get acquainted and see their strength. It is to be a time of great\r\nargument and powerful speeches. Where so appropriate to hold it as in\r\nthe goodly city of Philadelphia? Whigs, Know-nothings, Free-soilers,\r\nare to be there; anti-slavery Democrats, and staunch Republicans.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine was there. It continued for eight days. Its value lay in the\r\nfull and free discussion of the absorbing questions of the day, by\r\npeople widely separated and subjected to varied local influences. Men\r\nwere influenced by mercantile and commercial, by social and domestic\r\ninterests; by educational and religious interests, and it is almost\r\nimpossible for many minds of most excellent, though conservative\r\nquality, to rise above fixed orders of things to the clear apprehension\r\nand vigorous grasp of a great principle.\r\n\r\nEarly education or neglect, also, may have dwarfed or blunted\r\nperceptions and capabilities; but, however, they came largely to see,\r\neye to eye, and great progress was made. There was a lengthening of\r\ncords and strengthening of stakes, and on the 22d of February, 1856,\r\nthe Republicans met in Pittsburgh and appointed its national committee,\r\nand arranged for its first nominating convention. The aim of the party,\r\naccording to Mr. Blaine’s voluminous report, had been declared to be\r\n“the restoration of the government to the policy of its founders; its\r\nideal of patriotism, the character of Washington; its vital philosophy,\r\nthat of Jefferson; its watchwords, American enterprise and industry,\r\nSlavery sectional, Freedom national.”\r\n\r\nThe delegates of twelve Northern states withdrew from the Philadelphia\r\nconvention, and left the New York and Southern delegates to their fate.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine’s work is principally at home, within the boundaries of his\r\nadopted state. But fiercer than ever, the fires of the great conflict\r\nare raging.\r\n\r\nJefferson has remarked, that “in the unequal contest between freedom\r\nand oppression, the Almighty had no attribute that could take part with\r\nthe oppressor.” And yet the Democratic party, in violation of its name\r\nand prestige could invoke the shades of this great man; could continue\r\nits warfare upon the life of the nation, and its encroachments upon the\r\nconstitution, and violation of a plighted faith wherever slavery made\r\nits frightful demands.\r\n\r\nAt the head of his editorial column, Mr. Blaine kept these words,\r\nprinted in capitals, from the last great speech delivered by Henry Clay\r\nin the United States senate, “I repeat it, sir, I never can and I never\r\nwill, and no earthly power can make me vote, directly or indirectly,\r\nto spread slavery over territory where it does not exist. Never, while\r\nreason holds its seat in my brain; never, while my heart sends its\r\nvital fluid through my veins, NEVER!”\r\n\r\nWm. H. Seward was battling against “the fall of constitutional liberty”\r\nin the senate. The Fugitive Slave Act had passed in 1850, and the\r\nMissouri Compromise abrogated in 1854, and now an extreme measure is\r\npending to protect United States officers in the arrest of fugitive\r\nslaves. Mr. Blaine prints the great speech in full. It had the true\r\nRepublican ring.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine’s final editorial for 1855, prior to the Republican\r\nconvention, and first presidential campaign, is every way so fine a\r\nsummary of the situation, and affords so clear a view of the man in\r\nall the moral earnestness of his powers and wide comprehension of\r\nthe subject, that we give two or three extracts from his editorial\r\nin the _Kennebec Journal_ of Dec. 28, 1855, on the “Condition of the\r\nCountry”:--\r\n\r\n  “It is the settled judgment of our ablest and best statesmen, that\r\n  the present is a more momentous period than any through which the\r\n  country has passed since the Revolution. The issue is fairly before\r\n  the American people, whether Democracy or Aristocracy, Liberty or\r\n  Despotism, shall control the government of this Republic.... The\r\n  contest enlists on one side the intelligence, the conscience, the\r\n  patriotism, and the best energies of the American people. On the\r\n  other are engaged the avarice, the servility, the ignorance, and the\r\n  lust of dominion which characterize human depravity in every age and\r\n  nation.\r\n\r\n  “There are in reality but two sides to this great question. There is\r\n  no ground of neutrality. As true now is it as it was in the days of\r\n  the Great Teacher of liberty and salvation, that men cannot serve\r\n  opposite principles at the same time.... The deepening cry from\r\n  all quarters is that the White House must be cleansed, and all the\r\n  channels to and from the same thoroughly renovated. The march of\r\n  slavery must be stopped or the nation is lost. Only by the firm and\r\n  practical union of all true men in the nation can its most valuable\r\n  interests be preserved.\r\n\r\n  ... “We are, then, for a common union against the National\r\n  Administration, on the basis of restoring the Missouri Prohibition\r\n  against slavery in the territories, forgetting past distinctions and\r\n  priority in the combination. Who shall be the standard-bearer of this\r\n  patriotic and conservative Opposition in the great struggle of ’56?\r\n  Whoever the right man may be,--whether he has his home in the East or\r\n  the West, in the North or the South, we care not, if he is but the\r\n  statesman to comprehend the hour, and is equal to the necessities of\r\n  the country, we hope to see him triumphantly elected. We only ask\r\n  that he be loyal to Liberty, a sworn defender of the Union on its\r\n  constitutional basis, in favor of bringing back our government to\r\n  the principles and policy of its founders, and pledged to undo the\r\n  giant wrong of 1854. To enlist in such an opposition, patriotism, the\r\n  memory of our Revolutionary sires, everything sacred in our history,\r\n  the welfare of posterity, invoke us. In such a ‘union for the sake of\r\n  the Union’ we shall all be Republicans, all Whigs, all Democrats, all\r\n  Americans.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nIN THE LEGISLATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great year of Republicanism dawns, in which its friends are to\r\nmeet, and its foes are to feel its power. Men had been hearing the\r\nvoice of conscience on the moral questions of the nation. Money had\r\nstiffled it with some; for others the climate and location were\r\nnot propitious; blight and mildew had struck some,--darkness to\r\nthem was light, black was white. Some, perchance, held the truth in\r\nunrighteousness; trimmers and time-servers abounded. But the press and\r\nthe pulpit had been great educators. God was in the contest, and it was\r\nbeginning to be apparent. There were light and glory all about the sky,\r\nbut reformations that reform, and revolutions that revolutionize have\r\nin them not only forceful, but voluntary powers. There are always those\r\nwho will not be persuaded or won, on all grave questions. They must be\r\npassed by or overpowered.\r\n\r\nTo get men into position upon all questions of the nation’s life\r\nand destiny, it is needful to first get the questions into position.\r\nRepublicans had undertaken a herculean task. It was not the\r\nemancipation of slaves, but of the nation itself. The thraldom of a\r\nmighty woe was on her.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine entered the year with the same great purpose, and the same\r\nbold enunciation of principles. He was a true knight. His pen was\r\nmightier than the sword. It was never idle, never cold. From home to\r\noffice, and office to senate, and back to office and home he went, day\r\nby day, wherever truth and right could be served.\r\n\r\nWashington’s birthday came soon, and with it the Republican gathering\r\nat Pittsburgh, and then the great convention that nominated Frémont\r\nand Dayton at Philadelphia, in the summer of 1856;--Blaine was there;\r\nit was on his native heather. Never had men listened so intently since\r\nthe farewell address of Washington; rarely had they thought, and felt,\r\nand resolved so deeply. Conscience and will, intelligence and love,\r\nwere in all they thought, and said, and did. They chose their men for\r\nstandard-bearers, and fought out the hard, bitter fight. It was a good\r\nfight, and they kept the faith.\r\n\r\nIt was on his return from the convention in Philadelphia that he was\r\nselected, of all who went, to report to the citizens at home. It was\r\nhis first oratorical effort in Augusta, if not his first since leaving\r\ncollege. His pen had done the work. There had been no demand for\r\noratory. He surprised himself and astonished his hearers, and from that\r\nhour the door was open for him to enter the state legislature.\r\n\r\nAn old friend and neighbor of Mr. Blaine has, since his nomination,\r\ngiven the following sketch of the speech:--\r\n\r\n“This was his first public effort. He was then twenty-six years of\r\nage. Although remarkably ready and easy of speech and holding a\r\npracticed and powerful pen, he had an almost unconquerable repugnance\r\nto letting his voice be heard, except in familiar conversation, where\r\nhis brilliant powers of statement and argument, his marvelous memory\r\nof dates and events in political history, and his acquaintance with,\r\nand keen estimate of the public men and parties of the day, were the\r\ndelight and wonder of all who listened to him. The writer well recalls\r\nthe trepidation, at once painful and ludicrous, with which he rose to\r\naddress the meeting. In confronting the sea of faces, almost every\r\none of which was known to him, he seemed to be struggling to master\r\nthe terror that possessed him. He turned pale and red by turns, and\r\nalmost tottering to the front, he stood trembling until the generous\r\napplause which welcomed him had died away, when, by a supreme effort,\r\nhe broke the spell, at first by the utterance of some hesitating words\r\nof greeting and thanks, and then gathering confidence, he went on with\r\na speech which stirred the audience as with the sound of a trumpet, and\r\nheld all present in breathless interest and attention to its close.\r\nFrom that moment Mr. Blaine took rank among the most effective popular\r\nspeakers of the day; but it may be doubted if among the many maturer\r\nefforts of his genius and eloquence upon the political platform or\r\nthe legislative tribune, he has ever excited an audience to a more\r\npassionate enthusiasm, or left a profounder impression upon the minds\r\nand hearts of his hearers.”\r\n\r\nHis editorials of this year would fill a large volume, and all bold,\r\ntrenchant, and uncompromising in tone. His experience of the year\r\nbefore had just fitted him for this hard, strong work. The temptation\r\nis exceedingly great to make copious extracts, for it is our single\r\neffort to cause the man to appear in all the just and worthy splendor\r\nof his enduring manhood, and if a scar is found in all of wide\r\nresearch, no hand shall cover it.\r\n\r\nNot alone the great cause, but the great men who embodied it, were to\r\nhim an inspiration. Next to books, men were his study. He studied the\r\nnation in them, and all the questions they incarnated. Henry Wilson\r\nwas to him an inspiration. “All praise to the cold and lofty bearing\r\nof Henry Wilson at the Philadelphia convention,” he writes of him in\r\nhis issue of June 22, 1854. And all the great, strong men of the party\r\nloomed up before him at full stature, and had a large place in his\r\naffections. They were the apostles of liberty to him.\r\n\r\nThe last year of Mr. Blaine’s journalistic career in Augusta was tame\r\ncompared with other years, and yet the paper continued a splendid\r\nspecimen of what the leading paper at the state capital ought to\r\nbe,--rich in every department, and justly noted for the courage and\r\nacumen of its editorial writings.\r\n\r\nThe great presidential campaign had resulted in the election of James\r\nBuchanan, to whom the _Richmond Enquirer_ immediately gave this\r\nfriendly word of caution: “The president elect will commit a fatal\r\nfolly if he thinks to organize his administration upon any other\r\nprinciple than that of an avowed and inflexible support of the rights\r\nand institutions of the slave-holding states. He who is not with us is\r\nagainst us, and the South cannot attach itself to an administration\r\nwhich occupies a _neutral_ ground, without descending from its own\r\nlofty and impregnable position.”\r\n\r\nIn announcing the cabinet of Mr. Buchanan and the Dred Scott decision\r\nin the same issue, Mr. Blaine says,--“The conquest of slavery is\r\ncomplete. President, cabinet, congress, judiciary, treasury, army,\r\nnavy, the common territory of the union are all in its hands to be\r\ndirected as its whims shall direct.” The five great acts in the drama\r\nof national shame and degradation he mentions as, “the Fugitive Slave\r\nAct, repeal of the Missouri Compromise, the raid on Kansas, election of\r\nJames Buchanan, and the supreme court decision in the Dred Scott case.”\r\n\r\nIt was a great deal for the nation to endure, but it was the thing to\r\narouse the nation to the iniquity to be overthrown by the Republican\r\nparty in the next election. Five of the nine judges were from the\r\nSouth, and two of the others, Nelson and Grier, were selected with\r\nspecial regard to their fidelity to the slave-holding interests of the\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\nBut there was some honor and joy in the fact that Hannibal Hamlin was\r\nGovernor of Maine, and United States senator elect. His inaugural\r\naddress Mr. Blaine heads,--“A Paralytic Stroke.”\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, a time for great men to speak out, and this Mr. Hamlin\r\ndid with power. So greatly had the _Journal_ prospered under the\r\nfirm management of Stevens and Blaine, that they removed from the\r\noffice at the corner of Oak and Water Streets, which it had occupied\r\nfor twenty-four years, and at great expense, added new and improved\r\nmachinery. This had scarcely been done a month when Mr. Blaine’s name\r\ndisappears from its management. He had sold his interest in the paper\r\nfor “a good, handsome price,” and invested it all, beside money loaned\r\nfrom a brother-in-law, in coal lands in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nHe urged his partner, Mr. Stevens, to sell out his interest and do\r\nthe same. This investment, says Mr. Stevens, was very fortunate, and\r\nhas yielded him handsome returns. But Mr. Blaine was wanted on the\r\n_Portland Daily Advertiser_. John M. Wood, a man of wealth, owned it,\r\nand was looking around for an able editor. Mr. Blaine had acquired a\r\nreputation as editor, and was offered the position, which he accepted\r\nat three thousand dollars a year salary, but never removed to Portland.\r\n\r\nThis year of 1857 is remembered as the year of the great financial\r\ncrash. It was anything but a crash to Mr. Blaine. He had sold\r\nhis paper, which he had brought into a leading position in state\r\njournalism, at a large advance, made a profitable investment of his\r\nfunds, gone on a salary of the first-class, for the time, and also been\r\nnominated and elected a member of the state legislature, as one of the\r\ntwo representatives of the city of Augusta.\r\n\r\nHis popularity is seen in the fact that at the time of this seeming\r\nbreak-up, when if he had been a machine man with insatiable political\r\naspirations he would certainly have held on to his paper, and parted\r\nwith it at no price, he artlessly sells out and enters business about\r\neighty miles from home. But the people wanted him. He would not leave\r\ntheir midst. He had served the cause of his espousal with ability and\r\nfidelity for three years, and the time had come to honor him.\r\n\r\nIt is not often that a man so young comes into an old established\r\nstate, and in a time so brief makes for himself a name and a place so\r\nlarge.\r\n\r\nIt is only needful to read over the files of that paper from the first\r\nhour his pen touched it to see that he had made for himself a place so\r\nlarge. He had put himself into its columns, and so into the life both\r\nof the state and the nation. He lived, and thought, and wrought for\r\nthat paper. That was the instrument of his power. The bold thunder of\r\nartillery is heard along its columns; the charge of cavalry and the\r\nsweep of infantry are seen and felt upon its pages. There is push, and\r\ndash, and rush, and swing, and hurrah along the whole battle-line\r\nwhere he stood and fought through those years. It was a manly fight.\r\nHe stood squarely to the line. It was all upon the broad scale of the\r\nnation’s existence and welfare. He spoke the truth as such; he had no\r\ndreams to tell.\r\n\r\nHe took no vacation, but summer and winter was at his post. In July and\r\nAugust there is no relaxation, but the same dash of breakers on the\r\nshore. No wonder he was in demand elsewhere, and the fee was large.\r\nHe was a business success, and had made a success of politics thus\r\nfar. The first Republicans of Maine had gone into office mid the glow\r\nof his genius, and now his turn had come. It was a weekly before, but\r\nnow it was a daily, and a seat in the legislature to fill beside. But\r\nhe was abreast of the times, a full man, a large man, with immense\r\ncapabilities of work, and a strong, tenacious memory, or he could never\r\nhave done the work of two men steadily, and four men much of the time,\r\nand a man destined for leadership. He took to Portland all his powers,\r\nand soon was felt as fire is felt, or the rising sun, for foes and\r\nfriends learned speedily of his presence. Every day was a field-day in\r\npolitics then. It was a political revival all the year round. No ponds\r\nor pools were visible. There were currents in every stream. There was\r\na mighty flood to the tides. The states were raising men and building\r\ncharacters. They were mining gold and minting it. Life then was a\r\nBessemer steel-process; the heat was intense, and hydraulic pressure\r\ndrove out all impurities. The great columbiads that did the execution\r\nwere cast before the war; they were large of calibre and deep of bore,\r\nand thoroughly rifled, for it was the men who manned the guns in war\r\ntimes who made the guns man the rebellion.\r\n\r\nThe clouds are drawing water and marshaling forces for the sweep of a\r\nmighty storm,--the storm of a righteous judgment, of a holy justice. It\r\nwas God’s storm and must come. Already the lightning played furiously\r\nalong the sky, and mutterings of thunder could be distinctly heard.\r\nThe air grew thick, and heavy, and dark. All signs were ominous. From\r\nthrone to cloud, and cloud to brain, and brain to pen, the electric\r\ncurrent flew. Men were thinking the thoughts of God. They were being\r\nfilled with his vision and armed with his purpose. No times were\r\ngrander since men had pledged their lives, and fortunes, and sacred\r\nhonor at the shrine of Liberty, for its perpetuation; and now their\r\nsons from heights of manhood just as lofty, were breathing the same\r\nspirit and plighting the same faith. How men stretch upward to a kingly\r\nheight when such grand occasions come, or wither and waste like froth\r\non the billows that charge along the shore!\r\n\r\nIt was promotion to rank of greater influence when Mr. Blaine took\r\nhis sceptre of power in Portland. Six times a week instead of once,\r\nhe went out in teeming editorials to the people. Every department of\r\nthe paper was enriched and felt the thrill of his presence. He was a\r\ngraduate in journalism now. Its ways were all familiar. His study of\r\nit and experience had brought him the ability of hard, rapid work. It\r\nwas the testimony of his old associate at Augusta, that he would go at\r\nonce to the core of a subject, and get the wheat out of the chaff. The\r\nbeginning and ending of an article, he said, were its heavy parts, and\r\nMr. Blaine knew just where to look, whether in newspaper, review, or\r\nbook.\r\n\r\nHe always found what he wanted, and so was always armed to the teeth\r\nwith fact and incident, with argument and illustration. He had the eye\r\nand ear and pen of the true journalist.\r\n\r\nSome men have a peculiar faculty for getting at what is going on. They\r\nseem to know by instinct. It is not always told them, but they are good\r\nlisteners, as all great men are. They are men of great industry; search\r\nand research are ever the order with them.\r\n\r\nSome men are sound asleep when the decisive hours of life are passing,\r\nothers seem ever awake It is this ability to see, and hear, and feel,\r\nto catch and ever know, that has made Mr. Blaine a living centre of\r\nthe political intelligence of his time. As a student of history he had\r\nlearned the ways of men and nations, the policies of governments, and\r\nthe methods of their execution, their meteorology, mineralogy, and\r\nways of navigation,--for nations have all of these, political weather,\r\nmaterials of construction, together with tides and currents in their\r\naffairs, besides rocks and reefs and coasts of danger. The right ways\r\nare always the great ways, the light the best ways.\r\n\r\nAll the light of any subject comes from the truth it holds within,\r\nand the man of mastery is the man of light and life and energy. It is\r\nunfilled capacity that makes of so many the sounding brass and tinkling\r\ncymbal. Unfed, untrained, and unworked minds have filled the world with\r\nwrecks.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine is climbing the ladder now. Coming up out of the ranks, as\r\nsome must come, with worth or worthlessness.\r\n\r\n  “Heaven is not reached by a single bound,\r\n  But we climb the ladder by which we rise.”\r\n\r\nIt was General Taylor’s great difficulty in Mexico to bring on a\r\nbattle. This at times requires the ablest generalship; but this he\r\nfinally succeeded in doing at Buena Vista, and so created the occasion\r\nof his greatest victory. This was a power in the tactics of Mr. Blaine.\r\nHe was never afraid to attack, and never out of ammunition, however\r\nlong the siege or strong the foe.\r\n\r\nSoon after he entered the legislature Mr. Blaine encountered Ephraim\r\nK. Smart, one of the greatest men of his party, a man who had been in\r\ncongress, and afterward was twice their candidate for governor. While\r\nin congress he had opposed the extension of slavery in Kansas, and the\r\nrepeal of the Missouri Compromise which limited slavery to the Southern\r\nstates; but now, during the Buchanan régime, when the party seemed\r\nhopelessly sold to slavery, he went back on his record, swore by the\r\nparty, and stood by its record, regardless of his own.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine was thoroughly posted, and when the time came turned it\r\nagainst him in debate. It was a time of danger at the nation’s capital;\r\nassaults were frequent, thrilling scenes were enacted everywhere.\r\nEach hour brought the country nearer the verge of war. Our man was\r\nfearless and he was strong,--strong in the right, strong in his\r\nknowledge of the situation, strong in the command of his powers; so\r\nwith his ever aggressive spirit of true progress, he hurled his lance.\r\nWith a merciless skill he unfolded the history of the man, with all\r\nof its inconsistencies, sophistry, and contradiction, and reaching\r\nthe climax he held it up to view, and advancing towards him (his name\r\nwas Ephraim), he said, with great dramatic power, “Ephraim is a cake\r\nunturned, and we propose to turn him.”\r\n\r\nImagine if you can the bewildered consternation of the man! It was one\r\nof Mr. Blaine’s first triumphs in the house, and a stride toward the\r\nspeaker’s chair.\r\n\r\nWith this same spirit and power he did his work at Portland. His\r\nposition afforded him the best opportunity for news of every sort, and\r\nhis legislative work was largely in the line of his editorial, so that\r\npreparation for the one was fitness for the other. Yet life was full to\r\nthe brim. He was a man of immense vitality, and is to-day, as almost\r\ndaily intercourse with him can testify.\r\n\r\nThe first day of his duties in the legislature he is appointed chairman\r\nof a committee of five to inform the newly-elected governor, Lot M.\r\nMorrill, of his election. Thus he is recognized and honored as the\r\nchief one, worthy to represent the body in the presence of the governor.\r\n\r\nA few days after, he presented a long, well-worded resolution that the\r\nhouse, in concurrence with the senate, according to certain forms of\r\nlaw indicated, proceed, upon the following Tuesday, at twelve o’clock,\r\nto elect a United States senator to succeed Hon. Wm. Pitt Fessenden,\r\nwhose term expired on the fourth of March, of that year. Also an\r\nimportant resolution submitting an amendment of a legal character\r\nto their consideration, thus showing that his knowledge of law was\r\nutilized by him as a law-maker.\r\n\r\nAs one of the chairmen of the State Prison committee of the house he\r\ndelivers a long speech upon the 17th and 18th of March in reply to one\r\ndelivered by the same Hon. E. R. Smart, who had opposed resolutions\r\npresented by Mr. Blaine’s committee upon improving the present prison\r\nand building another.\r\n\r\nMr. Smart was evidently the aggressor, and very much his senior in age,\r\nbut Mr. Blaine sharply tells him that large portions of his speech were\r\nirrelevant, having been delivered the night before in a democratic\r\nmeeting downtown; calls him the Earl of Warwick to the Democratic\r\nPlantagenets; compares him, with great vigor, to a character in Gil\r\nBlas, who had written a book in support of certain remedies sure to\r\ncure, and which, though utterly futile, he argued with a friend he must\r\ncontinue to practice, because he had written the book, and so Mr. Smart\r\nmust inflict his speech because he had written it.\r\n\r\nBlaine was well-armed; had a wide array of statistics; had, indeed,\r\nbeen over the ground thoroughly the year before with the governor, and\r\nwritten it up for his paper, and showed himself competent to take care\r\nof his committee.\r\n\r\nA short time before this he had made a handsome little speech in favor\r\nof a resolve introduced by this same leader of the Democracy, in which\r\nhe desired a new county formed, and his own town of Camden made the\r\nshire-town, and yet Mr. Blaine’s measure, a necessity, and for the\r\npublic good, is violently assailed.\r\n\r\nA careful examination of the proceedings of the legislature prove this\r\nto be a fact, that Mr. Blaine was a devoted, constant, and faithful\r\nmember; that about every motion he made was carried; and that he ranked\r\nin ability as a speaker, both in matter and method, with the best of\r\nthem. His three years’ work as an editor had made him well acquainted\r\nwith its members, and thoroughly conversant with the ways of the house,\r\nso that he was thoroughly at home in their midst, with none of the\r\nnervous diffidence which a new member from the country, however good\r\nand honest he might be, would be very likely to have. He spoke about as\r\nhe wrote. He had written about five hundred good, solid editorials in\r\nthe previous years, as they issued a tri-weekly during the session of\r\nthe legislature, and in reporting its doings had caught the drift of\r\nits operations.\r\n\r\nMoreover, he had a good business preparation for his work. He had been\r\nlargely upon his own resources for ten years, and in the business\r\nmanagement of his paper, and in studying up the business interests of\r\nthe city and of the state, he had acquired experience and knowledge.\r\nNo one, it would seem, can read the record of his speeches, short\r\nand long, or the motions he made, resolves he offered, without being\r\nimpressed that he had a clear, strong way of looking at questions. He\r\ncould tell the husk from the corn at a glance, and if he had anything\r\nto do with a member’s speech would tear off the husk without any\r\nceremony and make quick search for the corn.\r\n\r\nBut the affairs of the country were in a bad way as Mr. Blaine was\r\ndaily recording them. There had been over nine thousand business\r\nfailures in the country in 1857 and 1858; or, to be exact, there were\r\nfour thousand nine hundred and thirty-two in 1857, and four thousand\r\ntwo hundred and twenty-five in 1858, with a loss of three hundred and\r\neighty-seven million four hundred and ninety-nine thousand six hundred\r\nand sixty-two dollars, a sum in those days of enormous proportion.\r\nSlave-holders, who had the power then, were urging the purchase of\r\nCuba, at a cost of two hundred million dollars, for the purposes of\r\nslavery.\r\n\r\nThe country seemed to be at a stand-still, or going backwards. The\r\nstate of Vermont had increased in population but one thousand six\r\nhundred and fifty-seven in ten years, from 1850 to 1860.\r\n\r\nSenators Crittenden, of Kentucky, and Seward, of New York, had a\r\npassage of words in the senate, and apologized.\r\n\r\nFessenden had been re-elected to the United States Senate, and New\r\nHampshire had gone Republican.\r\n\r\nBut Stephen A. Douglas had beaten Abraham Lincoln for the senate\r\nfrom Illinois by a vote of fifty-eight to forty-four, and Seward had\r\nintroduced his famous bill for the repression of the slave trade, just\r\nto bring the Southern senators into position on that subject, and this\r\nonly a year before Lincoln was nominated. It provided for ten steamers,\r\nas a part of the navy, to cruise along the coast of Africa, as the\r\npresident might direct.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Oregon is admitted as the second state on the Pacific\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine deals with all the questions of the day with skill and\r\neffectiveness. A municipal election is going on in Portland, and\r\nMr. Blaine does his part by tongue and pen to aid in achieving a\r\nRepublican victory, which is triumphantly accomplished just as the\r\nlegislature is closing. But Mr. Blaine has time to deliver his best\r\nspeech of the session, on Friday before final adjournment on Tuesday,\r\nApril 5th, after a session of ninety days. Now he has nearly nine\r\nsolid months of straight editorial work. The one great object is\r\never prominent,--slavery must go, or it must be restricted and kept\r\nout of the territories. The country is in great commotion; state\r\nafter state fights out its battles and wheels into line. In border\r\nstates, especially, political revolutions are taking place. The\r\ngospel of Liberty is taking the place of the hard political doctrines\r\nof pro-slavery Democracy. Mr. Blaine has to fire at long range, so\r\nefficiently has the work been done at home, but it is cheering to see\r\nthe beacons lighted along the coast of Maine, and to know that the\r\nbonfires are lighted all over the state. Men have already been trained\r\nand gone forth to do yeoman service in other states. The Washburns are\r\nin Illinois, Wisconsin, and Minnesota, while Israel Washburn, Jr., has\r\njust been elected governor of the home state.\r\n\r\nIn 1860 Mr. Blaine is elected speaker of the House, although his\r\ncolleague, William T. Johnson, of Augusta, was speaker the year before.\r\nThe singular popularity of the man is thus demonstrated, as he takes\r\nthe chair, escorted to it by his defeated competitor; his words are\r\nfew but in the best of taste. Mr. Blaine said,--\r\n\r\n  “GENTLEMEN OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\n  “I accept the position you assign me with a due appreciation, I\r\n  trust, of the honor it confers and the responsibility it imposes. In\r\n  presiding over your deliberations it shall be my faithful endeavor to\r\n  administer the parliamentary rules in such manner that the rights of\r\n  minorities shall be protected, the constitutional will of majorities\r\n  enforced, and the common weal effectively promoted. In this labor\r\n  I am sure I shall not look in vain for your forbearance as well as\r\n  your cordial co-operation. I am ready, gentlemen, to proceed with the\r\n  business of the House.”\r\n\r\nHe is in a position of power and influence now; he is in the third\r\noffice of the state. His ability will be tested; great presence of\r\nmind, quickness of decision, tact, and skill are needful. But he is\r\nready and at his ease. He has the knowledge requisite, and experience\r\nseems born of the man. He fits wherever placed. He must know each\r\nmember, and he knows them; he must be just, and fair, and honorable,\r\nand he is all of these by virtue of a broad, generous nature.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine is speaker of the House of Representatives of the state of\r\nMaine, not because of any one good quality,--he is excelled in single\r\nqualities by many another,--but because of a large combination of good\r\nqualities, and these, cultivated to a high degree. This it is that\r\nwins; many a face is beautiful in some one or more of its features, but\r\nso distorted in others that the effect is bad, and beauty, which is\r\nthe harmonious blending of many lines upon the canvas or features on\r\nthe face, is lost. Character is the restoration of moral order in the\r\nindividual; let this be broken by some defect, omission, or failure,\r\nsome secret or overt act, and the harmony is lost, and a once fair\r\ncharacter is marred.\r\n\r\nThus it is not so much the symmetry as the large and splendid\r\ncombination of talents and genius which make him what he is. He\r\nsimply does his best, and keeps himself at his best all the time. He\r\nanticipates every occasion, and has forces in reserve all the time,\r\nand they are brought forward, if his tactics are not known, very\r\nunexpectedly. The most telling points in all his earlier speeches are\r\nnot brought out at first, and when they do appear you wonder why he did\r\nnot produce them before, and this very wonder increases its power on\r\nyou. This is rather a necessity, it would seem, because there is point\r\nand pith, and power all through.\r\n\r\nA great year of destiny is before the nation; a mighty, conquering\r\nbattle-year. Slavery refuses any concessions, and Liberty loves itself\r\ntoo well to be compromised. The great convention of Republicans in the\r\nold wigwam in Chicago is an event of so great importance that all minor\r\nevents dwindle before it. James G. Blaine is there.\r\n\r\nExcitement is at the highest pitch. The tone and temper of the North\r\nis felt and feared. The old Democratic party is shattered into\r\nfragments. It has several wings, but no body. The Union seems on the\r\nverge of dissolution. But strong men, tried and true, who cannot be\r\nbrow-beaten and crushed; men who have not been deceived or intimidated,\r\nor despoiled of their convictions since the Whig party sold out to\r\nSlavery in 1852; men who have waited eighteen long, eventful years for\r\nthe iron to get hot enough to strike, are there; there in their power;\r\nthere, not to become demoralized, and drop their guns and run, but to\r\nstand firm and strong in a mighty phalanx, and do tremendous battle for\r\ntremendous right against tremendous wrong.\r\n\r\nWilliam H. Seward is the choice of men, but Abraham Lincoln is the\r\nchoice of God. He has been fitting and training him for half a century,\r\nmuch as he trained Moses, the great leader and emancipator of his\r\nancient people. They try in vain to elect their man. The way is hedged\r\nup; ballot after ballot is taken, but it cannot be done. Finally,\r\nthe moment comes, and “honest old Abe” is crowned by the hand of a\r\nremarkable Providence, and God’s will is done.\r\n\r\nMen shake their heads, but high yonder on his throne the King does his\r\nthinking. All is clear to him. Well-nigh a century of prayer is to be\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine’s description of the sessions and impressions at Chicago,\r\nmake the great, inspiring scenes live before the imagination, and show\r\nhow his broad, eager mind took it all in.\r\n\r\nTen of the Maine delegation were for Seward, and six for Lincoln. A\r\nmeeting was called, and an effort made by the Seward men to win the\r\nLincoln delegates to their side. Wm. H. Evarts was then in his prime,\r\nand was called in to make the speech. He spoke for forty-five minutes,\r\nand his speech, it was said, was “a string of pearls.” Mr. Blaine stood\r\njust behind him, and though greatly delighted with the beauty and\r\nbrilliancy of the address, remained a firm Lincoln man to the end.\r\n\r\nHe had no vote then, but he had a voice and a pen. From that time he\r\nwas a great admirer and friend of Mr. Evarts. This convention greatly\r\nenlarged Mr. Blaine’s knowledge of men and acquaintance with them.\r\n\r\nThe party in the four years since Frémont and Dayton had been nominated\r\nat Philadelphia, under the goading provocations of Buchanan’s\r\nadministration, the frequent exhibition of the horns and hoofs of\r\nSlavery, and the unwearied agitation in congress, and in every state,\r\ncounty, and town of the North, the East, and the West, had made a\r\nsturdy, constant, determined growth, a development of back-bone, and a\r\nkindling of nerve that imparted courage and sent joy to the heart.\r\n\r\nIt brought into the life of Mr. Blaine, more than ever, the life and\r\ngrandeur, the power and greatness of the party to which he had wedded\r\nhis destiny, giving his hand and his heart. He was in complete sympathy\r\nwith every principle and every measure. No man living more fully, and\r\nclearly, and strongly, represents the ideas and purposes of the men\r\nthen at the front,--the leading men to whom was entrusted the guidance\r\nand responsibility, for he himself was then at the front,--than does he.\r\n\r\nHe is, and has been, right through, the defender and conservator of\r\nall that was dear, and precious, and grand, then. Few men did more to\r\nhelp elect Mr. Lincoln, or to make his administration a power in the\r\nNorth. He was under fire constantly, but then he was firing constantly\r\nhimself, and doing execution that told every hour for the nation’s good.\r\n\r\nThe North was surely aroused as never before, on fire with a great and\r\nmighty excitement that rolled in waves and billows from ocean to lake,\r\nand lake to gulf. There was no general on the side of Slavery that\r\ncould command all the forces. It had come to be in fact a house divided\r\nagainst itself. Their convention at Charleston was broken up, and Mr.\r\nDouglas nominated at Baltimore, and two other candidates, Breckenridge\r\nand Bell, elsewhere. The serpent seemed stinging itself to death. But\r\nin the great party of the North there is a solid front, no waver along\r\nthe entire line. They simply fight their great political battle after\r\nthe true American style of the Fathers, in a most just and righteous\r\nmanner, and for a cause most just and righteous.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine was on the stump, as he had been the year before, making\r\nspeeches that the people loved to hear. The campaign usually closed in\r\nMaine in September, when the state officers were elected, and as the\r\nconvention in Chicago was held in May, they had but three months to do\r\nthe work that other states did in five months. Owing to the illness of\r\nhis old friend and business partner, he edited the _Kennebec Journal_\r\nfor five or six months during the summer and autumn of 1860, so that he\r\nwas back upon his old ground during the great campaign, sitting at the\r\nsame desk.\r\n\r\nThe people loved him, and he loved them. “Send us Blaine,” would come\r\nfrom all over the state. “We must have him, we will have him.” And he\r\nwould go. It seemed as if he would go farther, do more, and get back\r\nquicker than any other man, and seemingly remember everybody.\r\n\r\nEx-Gov. Anson P. Morrill, his old political friend and neighbor\r\nsays, “I would go out and address perhaps an acre of people, and be\r\nintroduced to a lot of them, and like enough, in six months or a year,\r\nalong would come a man and say, ‘How are you? Don’t you know me?’ and\r\nI would say ‘No,’ and then the man would turn and go off; but Blaine\r\nwould know him as soon as he saw him coming, and say, ‘Hello,’ and call\r\nhim by name right off.\r\n\r\n“There,” he said, and he laid his gold-bowed spectacles on the table,\r\nand continued, “a little better than a year ago he was in here, and we\r\nsat at this table, and the spectacles laid there, and he took them up\r\nand said, as he looked at them closely, ‘If those are not the very same\r\ngold-bowed spectacles you bought in Philadelphia in 1856.’\r\n\r\n“‘Why, how do you know?’ I asked in surprise.\r\n\r\n“‘Why I was with you, and you bought them at such a place on such a\r\nstreet.’\r\n\r\n“And that,” said the governor, “was twenty-six years before. Now did\r\nyou ever hear of anything like that? I didn’t. Why, I’d even forgotten\r\nthat he was there. I tell you that beat me; and I asked him ‘what made\r\nyou think of it now?’\r\n\r\n“‘O, I don’t know,’ said Mr. Blaine, ‘I just happened to see them lying\r\nthere, and thought of it.’\r\n\r\n“Well, it must be a good thing for you to remember things that way.”\r\n\r\n“And he simply replied, without any boasting, or in a way to make his\r\nhonored friend feel that he felt his superior faculty in the least,--\r\n\r\n“‘O, yes, it is, at times.’”\r\n\r\nGov. A. P. Morrill is a fine sample of a real down-east Yankee, of the\r\nold style; a man of sterling worth and integrity, and of the hardest of\r\ncommon sense, and takes a special pride in Mr. Blaine, as he was at one\r\ntime of great assistance to him in a political way.\r\n\r\n“The first time I saw Blaine,” he said, “was the night before my\r\ninauguration; he called at my hotel and wanted a copy of my address.\r\nHe was simply a young man then, very pleasant in his manner. But how\r\nhe has grown. Yes, that is the secret of it; he has been a growing man\r\never since, and so he has come right up and gone right along.”\r\n\r\nHis own re-election to the legislature is a minor matter in the\r\ncampaign of ’60, in comparison with the election of Mr. Lincoln\r\npresident. As this state votes earlier than many of the others, the\r\neffort is to roll up a large majority, and have great gains, so as to\r\ncarry moral power with it, and thus encourage other states who are\r\nstanding with them in the contest.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note the position of parties or presidential\r\ncandidates at this time. Mr. Lincoln would prohibit by law the\r\nextension of slavery. This was exactly the position of the candidate\r\nwith him for vice-president, the Hon. Hannibal Hamlin, a strong friend\r\nof Mr. Blaine.\r\n\r\nMr. Hamlin had originally been a Democrat of the Andrew Jackson type,\r\nbut when the Missouri Compromise, which prohibited the extension\r\nof slavery, was repealed, he entered the Republican party at its\r\nformation, and as candidate for governor in Maine in 1856, was a\r\npowerful factor in breaking down the Democratic party.\r\n\r\nMr. Breckenridge would extend slavery by law, and was of course the\r\nslave-holders candidate. Douglas, the candidate of the Northern\r\nDemocrats, would not interfere; simply do nothing to procure for\r\nslavery other portions of the fair domain of Liberty to despoil. This,\r\nof course made him unpopular in the South, where the demand was for\r\nmore states to conquer for our “peculiar institution.” The cry of the\r\nDouglas Democrats,--and they counted their wide-awakes by the thousand,\r\nwho marched with torch and drum,--“The Constitution as it is, and the\r\nUnion as it was.” The Bell and Everett faction were simply for saving\r\nthe Union without telling how.\r\n\r\nWhat a field these four great armies, each with its chosen leader,\r\noccupied, and each conducting a hot, fierce campaign, determined to\r\nwin, and determined to believe they would win. Slavery was the great\r\ndisturbing element. It was all a question of how to deal with this\r\nmonster.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln was elected, and Blaine was again on the winning side.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Blaine had another great interest in the political campaign\r\nof this year. A Mr. Morse, of Bath, had been in congress from another\r\npart of the third Maine district, in which Augusta is located, and\r\nit was thought time for a change, and Gov. A. P. Morrill wanted\r\nBlaine to run, but Morse was a strong man and Blaine was young, and\r\na new man comparatively, and though he was speaker of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, he thought it not prudent at that time to subject\r\nhimself to such a test. “Fools rush in where Angels fear to tread.”\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine was in a good position, and growing rapidly, and so he urged\r\nthe strong and sagacious governor to try it himself, and Blaine went\r\ninto the campaign and helped achieve the victory,--for victory it was\r\nby seven thousand majority.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine, it would seem, who possessed an instinct for journalism so\r\nwonderful and fine, possessed one equally well-developed for politics.\r\nHe well-knew that his rapid promotion would awaken jealousies,\r\nprejudice, and envy, and also that he needed and must have time to\r\ngrow. There was one at least in the state legislature who had been in\r\ncongress, and he did not wish to “advance backward,” as the colored\r\nservant of the rebel General Buckner called it.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine is a man of caution and carefulness, because he is a man of\r\ngreat thoughtfulness and deliberation. When he has thought a subject\r\nthrough, and it is settled, and he feels just right, he is ready, and\r\nhis courage rises, and so he moves with great power and determination.\r\nIf the action seems rash to any, it is because they are not informed\r\nupon a subject upon which he is conversant.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine had seen his man nominated at Chicago, and triumphantly\r\nelected over a stupendous, well-organized, and desperate opposition.\r\nHe himself is returned to the legislature. His friend, Ex-Gov. A. P.\r\nMorrill, is secured for congress, and Israel Washburn, Jr., a grand\r\nRepublican, elected governor over the man who felt and learned to fear\r\nthe power of Mr. Blaine in the legislature the year before, Ephraim K.\r\nSmart. But, notwithstanding all of these triumphs, and the prospective\r\ncleansing and regeneration of the country, the present condition is\r\nmost appalling.\r\n\r\nSecession is the chief topic throughout the South, and in every\r\ndebating society in every college, and in every lyceum in every town or\r\ncity, the question is being discussed with the greatest warmth, “Can a\r\nSouthern state secede?” or “Can the government coerce a state?” The old\r\ndoctrine of state rights and state sovereignty is the form of the topic\r\nin other quarters.\r\n\r\nWith many the question was clear on the asking of it; with others the\r\nconstitutional powers of self-preservation, of self-existence, and\r\nself-perpetuation had to be presented with the arguments and the acumen\r\nof a statesman. Perhaps Mr. Blaine, as an editor, never dealt with\r\na question in a more masterly way. It was the question of the hour\r\ncontinually forcing itself upon attention.\r\n\r\nIt was the constant assertion of the Southern press that they would.\r\nThey believed all sorts of unkind things about the great and kindly\r\nLincoln. The fact is, the South had never before been defeated in a\r\ncontest for the presidency when slavery was involved in the issue. This\r\nwas their pet and idol. They would guard it at all hazards. Fanaticism\r\nthey regarded as the animus of the anti-slavery movement, and an\r\nabolitionist to them was a malefactor.\r\n\r\nA grave responsibility now was on those who “broke down the adjustments\r\nof 1820, and of 1850.” But the year was closing, and the glare of a\r\ncontest more fierce than that through which we had passed, was on the\r\nnation. It seemed inevitable. They had grown so narrow, intolerant, and\r\ncruel, that the light of present political truth did not penetrate them.\r\n\r\n“Southern statesmen of the highest rank,” said Mr. Blaine, “looked\r\nupon British emancipation in the West Indies as designedly hostile\r\nto the prosperity and safety of their own section, and as a plot for\r\nthe ultimate destruction of the Republic.” They were suspicious, and\r\nfilled with alarm; and it was needless, as the action of Mr. Lincoln in\r\nproclaiming emancipation was only when, in the second year of the war,\r\nit was necessary.\r\n\r\nThe era of peace seems breaking with the hand of cruel war. It was\r\nnight to them, but a glorious day to us.\r\n\r\nWe close this chapter with this fresh, new poem of the time, by\r\nWhittier.\r\n\r\nAt a time when it was rumored that armed men were drilling by the\r\nthousands in Virginia and Maryland, for the invasion of Washington\r\nbefore February, so as to prevent the announcement in congress of\r\nLincoln’s election, in the same issue of the _Kennebec Journal_, was a\r\npoem by John G. Whittier, closing with these lines:--\r\n\r\n  “The crisis presses on us; face to face with us it stands,\r\n  With solemn lips of question, like the sphinx in Egypt’s sands!\r\n  This day we fashion Destiny, our web of Fate we spin;\r\n  This day for all hereafter choose we holiness or sin;\r\n  Even now from starry Gerizim, or Ebal’s cloudy crown,\r\n  We call the dews of blessing, or the bolts of cursing down.\r\n\r\n  “By all for which the Martyrs bore their agony and shame;\r\n  By all the warning words of truth with which the prophets came;\r\n  By the future which awaits us; by all the hopes which cast\r\n  Their faint and trembling beams across the blackness of the Past;\r\n  And in the awful name of Him who for earth’s freedom died;\r\n  Oh, ye people! Oh, my brothers! let us choose the righteous side.\r\n\r\n  “So shall the Northern pioneer go joyful on his way,\r\n  To wed Penobscot’s waters to San Francisco’s bay;\r\n  To make the rugged places smooth, and sow the vales of grain,\r\n  And bear, with Liberty and Law, the Bible in his train;\r\n  The mighty West shall bless the earth, and sea shall answer sea,\r\n  A mountain unto mountain calls, ‘_Praise God, for we are free!_’”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nSPEAKER OF THE MAINE LEGISLATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo one read the signs of the times with a clearer understanding of\r\ntheir significance, all through the winter and spring of 1861, than\r\nthe Speaker of the House of Representatives in the Legislature of\r\nMaine. The great duties that devolved upon him filled his mind with\r\nevery important matter, but the overshadowing interests were all\r\nnational,--the present and future of the country. They had become\r\naccustomed to threats and fears; this had grown to be the normal\r\ncondition of the public mind. But the short, sharp question “What is\r\nthe latest from Charleston, Richmond” and other points of prominence\r\nand activity in the South, showed how squarely up to the times people\r\nof the North were living; how loyal and zealous for the nation the\r\nmasses were.\r\n\r\nIt was a higher compliment, in times so great in their demands for the\r\nprofoundest deliberations of the best minds, to be put at the head, as\r\nthe leader in positions of greatest power in the House.\r\n\r\nKnown and acknowledged worth could have been the only argument for\r\nan action so personal to the honor of the state and its power in the\r\nUnion, and helpfulness to the nation in an emergency imminent with\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nThis man of one and thirty is lifted over the heads of old and\r\nrespected citizens of soundest integrity. Is it an experiment, or do\r\nthey know their man? The state has called to the helm a man who has\r\nbeen ten years in the congress of the United States; a man of largest\r\nexperience and profoundest wisdom, nearly twice the age of the young\r\nspeaker. But no mistake is made. He read in his youth books that\r\nGovernor Morrill is reading to-day at the age of eighty-one; he has\r\nbeen a college-graduate for nearly fourteen years, and has won his\r\npresent distinction upon the floor of the house where he now presides.\r\n\r\nHis duties are manifold. He must preside over the deliberations of\r\nthe House, be a good parliamentarian, prompt and accurate in his\r\ndecisions, as well as fair and impartial. He is dealing with freemen\r\nand citizens, and representatives of the people of the entire state.\r\nHe must know every member, not by name, and face, and location in\r\nthe House, but in characteristics and accomplishments, all the great\r\ninterests of the state, as a whole, of its different sections, and in\r\nits Federal relations, so that he may wisely appoint the twenty-one\r\nimportant committees. He must know the business, education, experience,\r\nresidence, and political principles of every member, so that he\r\nmay know just who to appoint on banks and banking, on agriculture,\r\nmilitary, pensions, manufactures, library, the judiciary, the militia,\r\neducation, etc.\r\n\r\nThere are one hundred and forty-four members, twenty-three of whom\r\nare Democrats, and he must use them all. He must select two chairmen\r\nfor each committee, and choose six or eight others to act with them,\r\nputting some of the more valuable men on several committees,--all must\r\nbe treated with honor and fairness.\r\n\r\nWhat did those one hundred and forty-four men see in James G. Blaine,\r\naway back in the stormy, perilous times of 1861, that led them to\r\nselect him for that high and honorable position? He had not been a\r\ncitizen of Maine six years, and had been in political life, officially,\r\nonly two years. It was the man they saw, strong and splendid, just the\r\nman for the hour. They felt, instinctively, they could trust him; they\r\nknew him to be loyal and true, and capable, by the testimony of all\r\ntheir senses. He was quick and keen, and life itself in all of energy\r\nand endeavor; a born leader of men.\r\n\r\nHe had no wealthy and influential friend by his side, no one to say I\r\nhave known him from childhood, and can recommend him as worthy of all\r\nhonor, and all praise. He brought with him simply the name his mother\r\ngave him, with no prefix and no affix. He lived in no mansion, rode in\r\nno carriage, was attended by no courtiers in livery; he had no returns\r\nto make, no promises to give. The whole of him sat before them,--a\r\nrefined and courteous gentleman, an elegant gentleman.\r\n\r\nThey could not mistake the powerful combination. They saw and felt its\r\nworth, and so the great party which had just come into power in the\r\nnation by electing its first president, honors itself by honoring him.\r\n\r\nHis short-cut words of acceptance are uttered. The senate and the\r\nnew governor, Israel Washburn, Jr., are informed that the House is\r\norganized, and they proceed to business with energy and despatch.\r\n\r\nBut the great war for the Union is coming. The peace convention\r\ncalled by Virginia amounts to nothing. Mr. Crittenden’s resolutions\r\nare futile, though most conventions adopt them in Philadelphia and\r\nelsewhere. Southern states are actually seceding.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln is choosing and announcing his cabinet, with Seward as his\r\nPremier, but treason is rampant in the South, holding high carnival in\r\nstate capitals, and even in the halls of congress. Mr. Lincoln is on\r\nhis way to Washington. He reaches Philadelphia on Feb. 22d, at seven\r\no’clock; is escorted to Independence Hall, where Theodore Cuyler, in\r\nwhose office Mr. Blaine read law, receives him with an address of\r\nwelcome, to which Mr. Lincoln replied, and “raised the national flag\r\nwhich had been adjusted in true man-of-war style, amid the cheers of a\r\ngreat multitude, and the cheers were repeated until men were hoarse.”\r\n\r\nWhile these patriotic cheers were resounding through the old halls of\r\nIndependence, the traitorous secretaries of the navy and of war were\r\nsending vessels to southern ports and forts. Thirty-three officers,\r\namong whom was Albert Sidney Johnson, abandon their regiments of the\r\nregular army in Texas, and join the rebels. But Lincoln is inaugurated,\r\nand the most pacific measures employed, but all of no avail;\r\ndetermined, desperate men are ruling the destiny of the South.\r\n\r\nThe South was in no condition of want at this time, but rather in a\r\ncondition of prosperity, and its proud, haughty spirit seemed rather\r\nborn of luxury and extravagance.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine has shown that she had increased in ten years before the war\r\nthree thousand millions of dollars, and this not from over-valuation of\r\nslaves, but from cultivation of the land by new and valuable appliances\r\nof agriculture. One state alone,--Georgia,--had increased in wealth\r\nthree hundred millions of dollars. But South Carolina had commenced\r\nin October,--before Mr. Lincoln’s election even,--her correspondence\r\nupon the subject of secession. No wonder she was ready in the April\r\nfollowing to inaugurate the war of the Rebellion.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine’s life could not be put into the nation, nor the life of any\r\nstrong, true man, at a time when it would be more valuable than now.\r\nMen were men in earnest. They rose to par, and some, by a mathematical\r\nprocess which redoubles energy and intensifies life, are cubed or\r\nsquared or lifted to the hundredth power; a premium is on them; they\r\nare invaluable.\r\n\r\nThe governor issues his call for ten thousand men from Maine. Will Mr.\r\nBlaine go? Mr. Garfield is in the state senate of Ohio, and president\r\nof a college, but he drops all at once, and is soon at the front with\r\nhis regiment. His stay is short, however. Elected to congress, by\r\nadvice of President Lincoln he lays aside the dress of a major-general\r\non Saturday to enter the national House of Representatives, a\r\ncongressman in citizen’s dress, the following Monday.\r\n\r\nWhat will Mr. Blaine do? He is speaker of the House, and that gives\r\nhis name a power in the state. He is wielding a powerful pen as editor\r\nof the leading daily paper at Portland. Few men in the state have more\r\ninfluence; some must stay; the state must be aroused and electrified;\r\nan immense work of organization is to be done. It is a less\r\nconspicuous, more quiet home-work, but it is of the utmost importance.\r\n\r\nHe stays, while many, like Garfield, go to return to do the statesman’s\r\nwork and make available the resources of the nation, and strengthen the\r\nhands of the brave men at the front.\r\n\r\nThis was a work of vast importance in the conduct of the war. It was\r\npower that was felt by both governor and president, by army and navy.\r\nMr. Blaine was on terms of intimacy with the governor of his state,--a\r\nfirm supporter of a faithful man. Very soon he was instrumental in\r\nraising two regiments, and rallied thousands more to the standard of\r\nthe Union.\r\n\r\nHe became at this time chairman of the Republican State Central\r\nCommittee, and continued in this position for twenty years. He planned\r\nevery campaign, selected the speakers, fixed dates and places for\r\nthem, and so arranged all details, that no man of his ever disappointed\r\nan audience. He knows the time of departure and arrival of every train.\r\nHe must do his part to see that the legislature continues Republican,\r\nthat the governor and his council are Republican, that congressmen and\r\nsenators of the United States are Republican, and that the war-power of\r\nthe state is not broken.\r\n\r\nThe great question for him to aid largely in settling is the worth of\r\nthe state of Maine to the nation. She must have governors that are in\r\nfull sympathy with the president; congressmen and senators that uphold\r\nhis administration.\r\n\r\nIn North’s History of Augusta, a valuable work of nearly a thousand\r\npages, it is recorded of Mr. Blaine that “probably no man in Maine\r\nexerted a more powerful influence on the patriotic course pursued\r\nthan he. Ever active, always watchful, never faltering, he inspired\r\nconfidence in the cause of the Union in its darkest days.”\r\n\r\nAt the close of the first session of the legislature over which Mr.\r\nBlaine presided, the leading Democrat in the House, a Mr. Gould, from\r\nThomaston, arose after remarks of great pathos and tenderness, and\r\npresented this resolution:--\r\n\r\n  “_Resolved_, That the thanks of this House are presented to the\r\n  Hon. James G. Blaine, for the marked ability, the urbanity and\r\n  impartiality with which he has presided over its deliberations, and\r\n  for the uniform amenity of his personal intercourse with its members.”\r\n\r\nHe bore testimony to the “marvelous despatch with which the formal\r\nparts of the business had been done, and so the session greatly\r\nshortened.”\r\n\r\nThe resolution was adopted by a unanimous vote, and Mr. Blaine said,--\r\n\r\n  “GENTLEMEN OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\n  “You will accept my most grateful acknowledgments for the very\r\n  cordial manner in which you have signified your approbation of my\r\n  course as your presiding officer. I beg in return to witness to the\r\n  dignity, the diligence, and the ability with which you have severally\r\n  discharged your representative trusts. We met, many of us, as\r\n  strangers; may I not hope that we all part as friends, and parting,\r\n  may we bear to our homes the recollection of duties faithfully\r\n  performed, and the consciousness of having done something to promote\r\n  the prosperity and welfare of our honored state. I bid you farewell.”\r\n\r\nThis was on the 18th of March, and on the 22d of April, the war having\r\nbroken out, they were assembled again in extra session, Mr. Blaine\r\nin the chair. In three days and a half provisions were made for\r\nraising troops and money for the war, and legislation pertaining to\r\nmilitia-laws was enacted, etc. The wildest rumors filled the air. The\r\ncountry seemed transformed at once into a turbulent sea, but men did\r\nnot lose their reckoning. Latitude and longitude were things too deeply\r\nfixed and broadly marked to be unseen or ignored. The storm blew from\r\na single quarter. Its long gathering had made it black and fierce. It\r\nstruck the gallant ship of state. She was reeling with the shock of war.\r\n\r\nNever did the beauty and worth of federal states appear to better\r\nadvantage than when the impoverished and plundered government called on\r\nthem for aid. It was the parent’s call upon her children for defence\r\nagainst their own misguided sisters. Never was mechanism more finely\r\nadjusted, or power more equally balanced, than in the Republic. Very\r\ndistinct and separate are head and feet and hands, eyes and ears, yet\r\nnothing is more perfect in its unity.\r\n\r\nIt is much the same with the great union of states. They are separated\r\nfar, and quite distinct in varied interests, but one in powerful unity.\r\nBut the time had come to show the strength of that unity. All there was\r\nof the great mind and heart and life of Mr. Blaine was given to the\r\nnation in holiest exercise of all his powers.\r\n\r\nWhile eighty thousand of the foe are opposing thirty-five thousand of\r\nour troops at Manassas Junction, and Colonel Ellsworth is losing his\r\nlife at Alexandria; while Stephen A. Douglas is delivering in early\r\nJune his last eloquent words, straight and heroic for the nation;\r\nwhile the bankers of Boston, New York, and Philadelphia are casting\r\none hundred and fifty millions of dollars into the national treasury\r\nat Washington, and the brave General Lyon with eight thousand men is\r\nrouting twenty-three thousand of the enemy in Missouri, at the cost of\r\nhis life,--while all the activities of that first summer of war are\r\ngoing on, Mr. Blaine is facing a political storm of great severity,\r\nas general-in-chief in the campaign that places Israel Washburn, Jr.,\r\nagain in the gubernatorial chair of the state, and keeps the reins of\r\ngovernment in Republican hands.\r\n\r\nIt has been a question often debated whether the nation is most\r\nindebted to her warriors or her statesmen. There can be no hesitation\r\nin deciding, where the mere question of life is considered, or the\r\nhardships of camp and march and field are included in the account. And\r\nyet Lincoln, nor Garfield wore a uniform when the bullet struck.\r\n\r\nNo one thinks their patriotism less intense, or that of cabinet, or\r\nsenators and members of the house, or governors and council, or members\r\nof legislatures less ardent in their love of country, and zeal for the\r\nhonor of her imperilled cause. At such times all true hearts are one,\r\nand the blood that throbs in hands and heart and feet is all the same.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine was re-elected to his accustomed place in the legislature\r\nof the state. The terrific war rages on. The demand for troops\r\nincreases,--is indeed quadrupled,--and the state must be brought up\r\nto her quota by methods the wisest and best. And again and again the\r\nclarion voice of the speaker of the House rings over the state with no\r\nuncertain sound. Companies and regiments are formed, and these must\r\nbe filled. The fires burning so brightly, must burn brighter. Intense\r\nlove must be intensified. The news of terrible battles thrills over the\r\nstate almost daily. The romance of war is over. Its gilt edge is gone.\r\nIt is hard, desperate, bloody work. Their sons and brothers and fathers\r\nare falling by the score and hundred at the front. The bloody work has\r\nbeen done at Ball’s Bluff and Port Royal. Sons of Maine are in Libby\r\nPrison and at Belle Isle.\r\n\r\nThe hard, serious question is discussed in every home. It fills the\r\ndreams of yeomanry,--“Shall I go?” “Can I go?” All that is sacred\r\nin business and religion in home and country is the question. Men\r\nare lifted by appeals almost divine in eloquence, above any petty\r\nconsideration, to the grave question of the nation’s life and destiny.\r\nTheir names go down by scores and hundreds. Regiments and brigades\r\nseem born in a day. They come from all ranks and conditions,--from\r\npulpit and press, from farm and shop, from bank and office, and store\r\nand halls of state,--and are transformed in an hour from citizens to\r\nsoldiers, and march away to the front. Steamer and car swarm with them.\r\n\r\nThe music dies away down the river, and they are gone,--gone perhaps\r\nforever. Good-byes are cherished in heart of hearts, and kisses from\r\nmother, father, lover, friend, are carried away like cameos of thought,\r\nthe sacred things of memory.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn we find Mr. Blaine in Washington, probably for the first\r\ntime, but not in official relations to the government. He must have a\r\nnearer view of the great scenes being enacted. He must know the men who\r\nare wielding the nation’s power, and put his finger on the pulse of\r\nwar, and gather material for the more intense activity his work at home\r\nassumes. He must see the great-hearted Lincoln, and shake his hand, and\r\ngive him cheer.\r\n\r\nFessenden, Hamlin, and Morrill are there, for congress is in session in\r\na city fortified, and its streets patrolled by soldiers. Andrew Johnson\r\nis the only senator present from eleven seceded states. Breckenridge,\r\nmortified by the vote of his state, and the rebuke and the castigation\r\nthe dead Douglas had given him in the early spring, was present from\r\nKentucky; and Lane and Pomeroy were in their seats from the new, free\r\nstate of Kansas, as her first senators. And the two Union senators\r\nwere there,--Messrs. Willy and Carlisle,--from the western portion\r\nof seceded Virginia. Only five free states had other than Republican\r\nsenators. Bright, Breckenridge, and Polk were expelled.\r\n\r\nChase, and Cameron, and Seward had entered the cabinet, but an\r\nimpressive array of talent remained in the senate, to be studied by\r\nour rising young statesman to best advantage. Charles Sumner and Henry\r\nWilson were there from Massachusetts; Zachariah Chandler, and Bingham,\r\nof Michigan; Wilkinson of Minnesota; John P. Hale and Daniel Clark,\r\nof New Hampshire; Benjamin F. Wade and John Sherman, of Ohio; Wilmot\r\nand Cowan, of Pennsylvania; James R. Doolittle and Timothy O. Hone,\r\nof Wisconsin. Jacob Collamore, formerly in General Taylor’s cabinet,\r\na ripe, scholarly man, was a senator from Vermont, and Simmons and\r\nAnthony, from Rhode Island.\r\n\r\nOn his first visit to the National Capital, Mr. Blaine could not fail\r\nto visit the House where he himself was destined to have a career so\r\nfamous and honorable alike to himself, his state, and the nation.\r\nThere was his friend, Anson P. Morrill, who had desired him to take\r\nthe nomination to congress the present session, rather than himself,\r\nand Galusha A. Grow, from his native state, a member of the convention\r\nwhich has just nominated him for the presidency, and of the committee\r\nnotifying of the same, was then in the chair to be reserved for\r\nhim as speaker of that house. Thaddeus Stevens, fearless, able, of\r\nintrepid spirit and strong character, the best hater of slavery on\r\nthe continent, hating even those who did not hate it, was the natural\r\nleader of the House, assuming his place by common consent. He attracted\r\nMr. Blaine’s special attention.\r\n\r\nJohn Hickman and Edward McPherson were with him from Pennsylvania;\r\nand from New York there were Reuben E. Fenton, experienced and strong\r\nin public affairs, Elbridge G. Spaulding, the financier, William A.\r\nWheeler, since vice-president, secretary Seward’s friend and confidant,\r\nTheodore Pomeroy.\r\n\r\n“The ablest and most brilliant man of the delegation,” says Mr. Blaine,\r\n“was Roscoe Conkling. He had been elected to the preceding congress\r\nwhen but twenty-nine years of age, and had exhibited a readiness and\r\nelegance in debate that placed him at once in the front rank. His\r\ncommand of language was remarkable. In affluent and exhuberant diction\r\nMr. Conkling was never surpassed in either branch of congress, unless,\r\nperhaps, by Rufus Choate.”\r\n\r\nMassachusetts had a strong delegation, headed by Henry L. Dawes,\r\nand with him were A. H. Rice, since governor of the state, Elliott,\r\nAlley, and William Appleton. Missouri sent Blair and Rollins, from\r\nthe battle-field. Crittenden, who had been six times elected to the\r\nsenate, in two cabinets, appointed to the supreme bench, was then in\r\nthe house, seeking with Charles A. Wickliffe, to save Kentucky to the\r\nUnion, against the treasonable conspiracies of Breckenridge. With\r\nCrittenden and Wickliffe strong for the Union, were Robert Mallory,\r\nJames S. Jackson, and William H. Wadsworth, keeping up the almost even\r\nbalance of power in their state. Gilman Marston was there from New\r\nHampshire, soon to become conspicuous in the field. Justin S. Morrill\r\nfrom Vermont, Frederick A. Pike, and the brother of senator Fessenden\r\nfrom Maine, in company with Ex-Gov. Anson P. Morrill. Illinois, Ohio,\r\nand Indiana had strong men there also, as did Iowa and Minnesota.\r\n\r\nElihu B. Washburn, Owen Lovejoy, William A. Richardson, and John A.\r\nLogan, represented the state of Lincoln and Grant; Schuyler Colfax,\r\nGeorge W. Julian, Albert G. Porter, Wm. McKee Dunn, and Daniel W.\r\nVoorhees, were there from Indiana; and from the state of Garfield,\r\nBingham, Shellabarger, Horton, and Ashley. Pendleton, Vallandigham, and\r\nS. S. Cox were on the Democratic side.\r\n\r\nIt must have been the dawn of an era of new inspirations and of fresh\r\naspirations, to look in upon such a body of men, only a few of the\r\nleaders of whom we have mentioned.\r\n\r\nAnson P. Morrill had written him, six months before he let anyone\r\nelse into the secret, that he should not run again for congress. His\r\nbusiness required his attention, having extensive woolen mills some\r\ntwelve miles from Augusta, and he did not enjoy life at Washington, and\r\naway from home.\r\n\r\nHe desired Mr. Blaine, as he had before desired, to take his place,\r\nand hence gave him a note of warning, and special opportunity for\r\npreparation. This surely betokened Mr. Merrill’s large confidence in\r\nMr. Blaine, which is certainly remarkable, when we remember that Mr.\r\nBlaine was twenty-seven years younger than Mr. Morrill, who was then\r\nin his prime, about sixty years of age; and yet he looks down upon a\r\nyoung man of thirty-one, and asks him to come up and take his place\r\nin the councils of the nation. Why this confidence, this unquestioned\r\nassurance of power, this high compliment of age and experience, of\r\nwealth, and extraordinary business ability of the old governor of Maine\r\nto the young and dauntless Speaker of the House at home?\r\n\r\nFirst of all, because he had abundantly found him as speaker of the\r\nHouse winning golden opinions from those over whose deliberations he\r\nhad presided.\r\n\r\nSecond, because he had just conducted, as chairman of the State\r\nCentral Committee of the Republican party, a campaign, re-electing\r\nGovernor Washburn, and himself to the legislature, and thus fighting\r\nunto victory the home-battle of the Union, meanwhile pushing hard and\r\nsuccessfully the editorial work of the _Daily Advertiser_ at Portland.\r\n\r\nBut more than either of these events or considerations, the\r\npresidential campaign of 1860 had endeared him to Mr. Morrill.\r\nThen he had stumped the state with the Hon. Anson Burlingame of\r\nMassachusetts,--he discussing the state issues while Mr. Burlingame\r\ndiscussed the national issues.\r\n\r\nAn old citizen high in state office to-day, who heard him frequently,\r\nsays “he won the people by the skill and comprehensiveness with which\r\nhe analyzed and argued the great questions of the time.”\r\n\r\nHe also said “that his editorials in the _Journal_ of that summer and\r\nautumn, when Mr. Stevens, his old partner, was sick, furnished all the\r\nmaterial for the campaign.” He gathered up and crowded in all there was.\r\n\r\nIt was that total exemption from indolence, his marked degree of\r\nenergy, and priceless abilities, that charmed the old governor and\r\nwarmed his great heart toward him. And then it was upon that same tidal\r\nwave of influence, sweeping out from the depths of that fresh, young\r\nlife, that Mr. Morrill himself was swept into his seat in congress.\r\n\r\nThe Democrats had up for governor their strong man that year, Ephraim\r\nK. Smart, who had been several terms in congress, and made the biggest\r\npossible fight that lay in their power, but all to no purpose. The\r\nspeeches of Mr. Blaine fixed the attention of the state upon him,\r\nas coming from a man away beyond his years. He could, we are told,\r\n“marshal statistics with great facility”; facts, figures, faces, he\r\nknew them all, and impressed the people, even the old campaigners,\r\nwith a boundlessness of political and historical knowledge that is\r\ndistinctly remembered to this day.\r\n\r\nThey have gotten use to this sort of thing up in Maine, and talk like\r\nmen who reached their conclusions years ago. Their minds were made up\r\nas to the man in Augusta, at least over a quarter of a century ago,\r\naway back in 1856, some of them when, fresh from the Philadelphia\r\nconvention, he made his Frémont and Dayton speech, twenty-eight years\r\nago, and he has simply been expanding, and enlarging, filling up, and\r\ngrowing ever since. He has been watched with eager pride and rejoiced\r\nin with the devotion of brothers and friends, as wave after wave of his\r\nmajestic influence has dashed across the boundary lines of the state,\r\nand broken over the nation.\r\n\r\nIt would have been something unaccountable if every round of the ladder\r\nhad not been touched at last by him, and yet there is no fatality about\r\nit. He was no child of destiny, but of industry; no creature of chance,\r\nbut of choice; not of luck, but of pluck; not of fortune, but of\r\nfortitude; not of circumstance, but of courage and consecrated energy.\r\n\r\nHe returned home from his first view of Washington with larger views of\r\nthe nation’s greatness, and the fierceness of the contests that were\r\ntesting her strength, and a holier ambition to make every power tell\r\nfor Liberty’s victory, and the nation’s emancipation from wrong, and\r\nher projection upon a loftier career of service among the nations of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nThe state could not hold him long after the revelation of these\r\nfew brief days and weeks. But he could wait his time, meanwhile\r\nreorganizing all the forces at his command for victory of a larger\r\nkind, and in a larger field than had fallen to his lot. And why not? He\r\nwas fast outgrowing the places filled thus far, and others were opening\r\nto him without the asking.\r\n\r\nThe plans for the new year are all laid before the old year dies. Then\r\nhe shall stand nearer the seat of war; then he shall study questions\r\nand characters, plans and persons, opinions, policies, and principles,\r\nall the great states and machinery of government. His home shall be\r\nin the great city and centre of the land, where authority, wisdom,\r\nand power reside, and where no excellence but is in demand, no great,\r\nshining quality but shall shine amid a thousand reflections, and name\r\nand place shall but increase each power to serve and save the nation’s\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\nSECOND TERM AS SPEAKER.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 1, 1862, Mr. Blaine was re-nominated by acclamation, and\r\nre-elected by an almost unanimous vote, Speaker of the Maine House of\r\nRepresentatives. The war was enlarging the demand for legislation. All\r\ngreat national issues must be discussed by the state legislatures, and\r\nthe demand for their adoption sprung from the people, a knowledge of\r\nwhose will could be best gained in this way. Resolutions were discussed\r\nas regards confiscating the slaves, and arming them in the nation’s\r\ndefence, and so the representatives in congress were instructed and\r\nencouraged, and their actions brought up as legislative measures and\r\nendorsed.\r\n\r\nGrave suspicions existed at this time in the minds of many in the state\r\nof Maine, in view of the attitude of the British nation towards the\r\nUnited States, and the feeling of a portion of the British people, as\r\ndeveloped by the Mason and Slidell affair, and the blockade-runners\r\nfitted out in British ports. The exposed condition of the coast and\r\nboundary line of Maine, had caused national alarm upon this subject to\r\ncenter largely in the state.\r\n\r\n“For more than four hundred miles,” said the governor, Israel Washburn,\r\nJr., in his inaugural address of January, 1862, “this state is\r\nseparated from the British Provinces of New Brunswick and Canada by a\r\nmerely imaginary line. Of the deep and bitter hostility to this country\r\nof large numbers of the people, we have now, unhappily,” he goes on to\r\nsay, “the most indubitable proofs.\r\n\r\n“Upon the coast of Maine there are more deep, accessible harbors,\r\ncapable of being entered by the largest ships of war, than can be found\r\non the entire coast-line of the slave-holding states; and yet since she\r\nentered the federal Union in 1820, less than half has been expended for\r\nher coast protection and improvement than was expended within ten years\r\nfor the building of a custom-house in the single city of Charleston.”\r\n\r\nThe old adage, “In time of peace prepare for war,” had not been\r\nfollowed, and now commissioners are sent to Washington to present\r\nthe facts regarding Maine’s defenseless condition, and the engineer\r\ndepartment was directed, by order of Simon Cameron, Secretary of War,\r\nto send a competent officer to examine and report upon the subject.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the topics filling the mind of Maine statesmen of this\r\ntime, and its importance is so presented and impressed, that on Jan.\r\n17, one hundred thousand dollars was appropriated for Fort Knox on the\r\nPenobscot River, Maine, one hundred thousand dollars for the fort on\r\nHog Island, Portland Harbor, and fifty thousand dollars each for these\r\ntwo forts the following year.\r\n\r\nSeldom were there so many bills of great importance to the state and\r\nnation before the legislature, as at this and subsequent sessions. But\r\nmost of the time the speaker sat quietly in his chair, exercising the\r\nfunctions of his office. Men seemed to be growing into greatness at\r\na single session; speeches of great effectiveness, and eloquent with\r\npatriotic ardor, came to be a daily occurrence.\r\n\r\nUnion victories began to cheer the nation. General Thomas at Mill\r\nSprings, Ky., had fought and won a glorious day. Forts Henry and\r\nDonelson had fallen, and hordes of rebels had surrendered. Nashville\r\nwas occupied by Union troops, and Andrew Johnson was appointed governor\r\nof Tennessee. Indeed, he was descending the steps of the Capitol at\r\nWashington with a bevy of his friends, and just starting for the\r\ncapital of Tennessee, the very afternoon of March 7th, to which we are\r\nabout to call special attention.\r\n\r\nNo scene more brilliant graces the early history of Mr. Blaine, than\r\nhis reply to Hon. A. P. Gould, a distinguished lawyer of Thomaston,\r\nand a member of the lower House, in vindication of the war-power of\r\ncongress. The hearty support of every Northern state was a necessity.\r\n\r\nThe following resolutions were passed by the Senate of Maine, on the\r\n7th of February, 1862, by yeas twenty-four, nays four:--\r\n\r\n  “STATE OF MAINE.\r\n\r\n  “RESOLUTIONS RELATING TO NATIONAL AFFAIRS.\r\n\r\n  “_Resolved_, That we cordially endorse the administration of Abraham\r\n  Lincoln in the conduct of the war against the wicked and unnatural\r\n  enemies of the Republic, and that in all its measures calculated to\r\n  crush this rebellion speedily and finally, the administration is\r\n  entitled to and will receive the unwavering support of the loyal\r\n  people of Maine.\r\n\r\n  “_Resolved_, That it is the duty of congress, by such means as\r\n  will not jeopardize the rights and safety of the loyal people of\r\n  the South, to provide for the confiscation of estates, real and\r\n  personal, of rebels, and for the forfeiture and liberation of every\r\n  slave claimed by any person who shall continue in arms against the\r\n  authority of the United States, or who shall in any manner aid and\r\n  abet the present wicked and unjustifiable rebellion.\r\n\r\n  “_Resolved_, That in this perilous crisis of the country, it is\r\n  the duty of congress, in the exercise of its constitutional power,\r\n  to ‘raise and support armies,’ to provide by law for accepting the\r\n  services of all able-bodied men of whatever status, and to employ\r\n  these men in such manner as military necessity and the safety of the\r\n  Republic may demand.\r\n\r\n  “_Resolved_, That a copy of these resolutions be sent to the senators\r\n  and representatives in congress from this state, and that they be\r\n  respectfully requested to use all honorable means to secure the\r\n  passage of acts embodying their spirit and substance.”\r\n\r\nThe resolutions were sent to the House for concurrence, and were there\r\nreferred to the committee of the whole. On the 6th and 7th of March,\r\nMr. Gould, of Thomaston, made an elaborate argument against them. At\r\nthe conclusion of his remarks he was replied to by Mr. Blaine, Speaker\r\nof the House. The resolutions were subsequently adopted by the House\r\nin concurrence with the Senate, by yeas one hundred and four, nays\r\ntwenty-six.\r\n\r\nMr. Gould had spoken for seven hours against the resolutions. The House\r\nhad gone into committee of the whole, with Mr. Frye, the present United\r\nStates senator, in the chair. The senate was present in a body, on one\r\nside, the governor and his council on the other, and as many as could\r\nenter, filled the galleries and vacant spaces, when Mr. Blaine, then\r\nbut thirty-two years of age, took up the gage of battle, and spoke for\r\ntwo hours, and so utterly demolished the premises and conclusions of\r\nhis powerful antagonist as to carry the resolution through the House\r\nwith but few dissenting voices.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine had been re-elected Speaker of the House by a vote of one\r\nhundred and thirty-five out of one hundred and forty, at the present\r\nsession. All eyes were turned to him as the man for the occasion.\r\n\r\nHis old paper, the _Kennebec Journal_, with which he had had no\r\nofficial connection for three years, says of the speech:--\r\n\r\n“Never, in the legislative history of Maine, has there been such an\r\nopportunity for a forensic effort as was presented in the House of\r\nRepresentatives on Friday afternoon, at the close of the seven hours’\r\nspeech of Hon. A. P. Gould on the national resolutions. The expectation\r\nof the legislature was that Hon. James G. Blaine would speak in defense\r\nof the principles and the measures by which the Federal government will\r\nbe able to crush the Rebellion and restore the Republic to that true\r\nand certain basis on which it was originally established. Mr. Blaine’s\r\nspeech occupied two hours, and was fully equal to the anticipations\r\nof the unconditional friends of the government. From beginning to\r\nclose it was crowded with arguments and salient facts, interspersed\r\nwith due proportion of wit, satire, invective and telling hits against\r\nthe doctrines and positions of his opponent. It showed, with great\r\nclearness and strength, that the power of confiscating the slaves of\r\nrebels belongs to congress, and to no other power. It adhered firmly\r\nto the long-recognized principle that _the safety of the Republic is\r\nthe supreme law_, before which every pecuniary interest must give way,\r\nand advancing in this broad highway, so clearly defined by the highest\r\nauthorities of international law, and so luminous with the best light\r\nof history, the speaker made a complete overthrow of the sophistry and\r\ndisloyalty of those who plead the defences of the constitution for the\r\nsecurity of traitors, as against the necessities of the Republic. The\r\nspeech was brilliantly eloquent, conclusive in argument, and in all\r\nessential particulars was a success which cannot fail to add to the\r\nreputation of the author.”\r\n\r\nWe give some extracts from the speech of Mr. Blaine:--\r\n\r\n  “The first hour of the seven which the gentleman from Thomaston has\r\n  consumed I shall pass over with scarcely a comment. It was addressed\r\n  almost exclusively, and in violation of parliamentary rules, to\r\n  personal matters between himself and a distinguished citizen\r\n  from the same section, lately the gubernatorial candidate of the\r\n  Democratic party, and now representing the county of Knox in the\r\n  other branch of the legislature....\r\n\r\n  “I shall best make myself understood, and perhaps most intelligibly\r\n  respond to the argument of the gentleman from Thomaston, by\r\n  discussing the question in its two phases: _first_, as to the\r\n  power of congress to adopt the measures conceived in the pending\r\n  resolutions; and, _secondly_, as to the expediency of adopting them.\r\n  And, at the very outset, I find between the gentleman from Thomaston\r\n  and myself a most radical difference as to the ‘war-power’ of the\r\n  constitution; its origin, its extent, and the authority which shall\r\n  determine its actions, direct its operation, and fix its limit. He\r\n  contends, and he spent some four or five hours in attempting to\r\n  prove, that the war-power in this Government is lodged wholly in the\r\n  executive, and in describing his almost endless authority, he piled\r\n  Ossa on Pelion until he had made the president, under the war-power,\r\n  perfectly despotic, with all prerogatives and privileges concentrated\r\n  in his own person, and then to end the tragedy with a farce, with\r\n  uplifted hands he reverently thanked God that Abraham Lincoln was not\r\n  an ambitious villain (like some of his Democratic predecessors, I\r\n  presume), to use this power, trample on the liberties of the nation,\r\n  erect a throne for himself, and thus add another to the list of\r\n  usurpers that have disfigured the world’s history.\r\n\r\n  “I dissent from these conclusions of the gentleman. I read the\r\n  Federal constitution differently. I read in the most frequent and\r\n  suggestive section of that immortal chart, that certain ‘powers’ are\r\n  declared to belong to congress. I read therein that ‘congress shall\r\n  have power’ among other large grants of authority, ‘to provide for\r\n  the common defence’; that it shall have power ‘to declare war, grant\r\n  letters of marque and reprisal, and make rules concerning captures\r\n  on land and water’; that it shall have power ‘to raise and support\r\n  armies’; to ‘provide and maintain a navy’; and ‘to make rules for\r\n  the government of the land and naval forces.’ And as though these\r\n  were not sufficiently broad and general, the section concludes in its\r\n  eighteenth subdivision by declaring that congress shall have power\r\n  ‘to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying\r\n  into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by\r\n  this constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any\r\n  department or officer thereof.’ Mark that,--‘in any department or\r\n  officer thereof!’...\r\n\r\n  “At the origin of our government, Mr. Chairman, the people were\r\n  jealous of their liberties; they gave power guardedly and grudgingly\r\n  to their rulers; they were hostile above all things to what is termed\r\n  the _one-man_ power; and you cannot but observe with what peculiar\r\n  care they provided against the abuse of the ‘war-power.’ For, after\r\n  giving to congress the power ‘to declare war,’ and ‘to raise and\r\n  support armies,’ they added in the constitution these remarkable and\r\n  emphatic words,--‘_but no appropriation of money to that use shall\r\n  be for a longer term than two years_,’ which is precisely the period\r\n  for which the representatives in the popular branch are chosen. Thus,\r\n  sir, this power was not given to congress simply, but in effect it\r\n  was given to the house of representatives; the people placing it\r\n  where they could lay their hands directly upon it at every biennial\r\n  election, and say ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the principle or policy of any\r\n  war....\r\n\r\n  “The other point at issue has reference to the relations that now\r\n  exist between the Government of the United States and the so-called\r\n  Confederate States. The gentleman from Thomaston has quoted the\r\n  treason clause of the constitution, and has elaborately argued that\r\n  the armed rebels in the South have still the full right to the\r\n  protection of property guaranteed therein, and that any confiscation\r\n  of their property or estates by any other process than is there\r\n  laid down would be unconstitutional. I am endeavoring to state the\r\n  position of the gentleman with entire candor, as I desire to meet his\r\n  argument throughout in that spirit. I maintain, sir, in opposition\r\n  to this view, that we derive the right to confiscate the property\r\n  and liberate the slaves of rebels from a totally different source.\r\n  I maintain that to-day we are in a state of civil war,--civil\r\n  war, too, of the most gigantic proportions. And I think it will\r\n  strike this House as a singular and most significant confession of\r\n  the unsoundness of the gentleman’s argument, that to sustain his\r\n  positions, he had to deny that we are engaged in civil war at all.\r\n  He stated, much to the amusement of the House, I think, that it was\r\n  not a civil war because Jeff. Davis was not seeking to wrest the\r\n  presidential chair from Abraham Lincoln, but simply to carry off a\r\n  portion of the Union, in order to form a separate government. Pray,\r\n  sir, is not Abraham Lincoln the rightful president of the whole\r\n  country and of all the states, and is it not interfering as much with\r\n  his constitutional prerogative to dispute his authority in Georgia or\r\n  Louisiana as it would be to dispute it in Maine or Pennsylvania?\r\n\r\n  “To assume the ground of the gentleman from Thomaston, with its\r\n  legitimate sequences, is practically to give up the contest. Yet\r\n  he tells you, and he certainly repeated it a score of times, that\r\n  you cannot deprive these rebels of their property, except ‘by due\r\n  process of law,’ and at the same time he confesses that within the\r\n  rebel territory it is impossible to serve any precept or enforce any\r\n  verdict. He at the same time declares that we have not belligerent\r\n  rights because the contest is not a civil war. Pray, what kind of a\r\n  war is it? The gentleman acknowledges that the rebels are traitors,\r\n  and if so, that they must be engaged in some kind of war, because the\r\n  constitution declares that ‘treason against the United States shall\r\n  consist only in levying war against them.’ It is therefore war on\r\n  their side. It must also be war on ours, and if so, what kind of war?”\r\n\r\n  [Mr. Gould rose and said that he would define it as domestic war.]\r\n\r\n  [Mr. Blaine, resuming.] “Domestic war! That’s it! Well, Mr.\r\n  Chairman, we shall learn something before this discussion is over.\r\n  Domestic war! I have heard of domestic woolens, domestic sheetings,\r\n  and domestic felicity, but a ‘domestic war’ is something entirely new\r\n  under the sun. All the writers of international law that I have ever\r\n  read, speak of two kinds of war,--foreign and civil. Vattel will,\r\n  I suppose, have a new edition, with annotations by Gould, in which\r\n  ‘domestic war’ will be defined and illustrated as a contest not quite\r\n  foreign, not quite civil, but one in which the rebellious party has\r\n  at one and the same time all the rights of peaceful citizens and\r\n  all the immunities of alien enemies--for that is precisely what the\r\n  gentleman by his argument claims for the Southern secessionists.”\r\n\r\nThe stormy and brilliant session was drawing to a close. The speaker\r\nhad achieved the great triumph of the winter. Others had made grand\r\nand effective speeches. It could scarcely be otherwise. Soldiers were\r\nencamped about the city; camp-fires were burning; martial music was\r\nfilling the air; Colonel Nickerson had marched his Fourteenth Regiment\r\nof Maine Volunteers through Augusta, and had come to a “parade rest”\r\non Water Street; troops were coming and troops were going; the papers\r\nwere filled with news from every quarter, containing even Jeff. Davis’\r\nmessage to the rebel congress. All was life and animation. Events\r\nwere hastening to the emancipation of the slave. It was the demand\r\nof the hour. From soldier in the field, citizen in the home and place\r\nof business, and from resolute, far-seeing statesmen in congressional\r\nhalls, came the imperative call to “free and arm the slaves!”\r\n\r\nWill the negro fight? was a question gravely discussed over the North.\r\nFred. Douglas, the colored orator of that time, was asked it by the\r\npresident of Rochester University, and the keen-eyed man replied,\r\n\r\n“I am only half a negro, and I know I’d fight.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the genial and scholarly president, Martin B. Anderson,\r\nwith a merry twinkle in his eye, “if half a negro would fight, Mr.\r\nDouglas, what would a whole one do?”\r\n\r\nAfter a session of seventy-eight days, in which “the public business\r\nhad been completed with all possible promptness,” the legislature\r\nadjourned. “During the past two years,” the record says, “with the same\r\npresiding officers in the senate and House,--Hon. John H. Goodenow, of\r\nAlfred, in the senate, and Hon. James G. Blaine, of Augusta, in the\r\nHouse,--there has not been a single appeal from their decisions.”\r\n\r\nIt is also said that the high character of the legislature of 1862\r\nstands unrivalled in Maine, in members of legislative experience, men\r\nof practical business talent, men learned and ready in debate, men\r\nwise in political action and patriotic in purpose. Surely it were an\r\nhonor to stand at the head of such a body of men.\r\n\r\nVery soon the Third Congressional Convention would be held to nominate\r\nthe successor to A. P. Morrill. The three counties embraced in the\r\ndistrict,--Kennebec, Somerset, and Lincoln,--sent to the legislature\r\nsix senators and twenty-eight representatives.\r\n\r\nThe district is an extensive one, embracing seventy-five towns, and\r\nextending from the Atlantic to the Canada line, inhabited by an\r\nintelligent and influential body of freemen, deeply interested in the\r\nwelfare of the country, and devoted to the principles and purposes of\r\nthe administration of Abraham Lincoln. The unqualified and emphatic\r\ndeclination of Mr. Morrill to be a candidate for re-election, rendered\r\nit necessary to take a new man for the position.\r\n\r\n“The superior ability and high qualifications of Hon. James G. Blaine\r\ndrew toward him the spontaneous and almost unanimous support of the\r\nfriends of the national administration in the district.”\r\n\r\nAt two o’clock on Friday afternoon of July 11, 1862, the ballot was\r\ntaken, and only one was needed. Whole number of votes, one hundred and\r\neighty-one; Hon. James G. Blaine had one hundred and seventy-four; W.\r\nR. Flint, five; scattering, two.\r\n\r\nThis is the simple record, and Mr. Blaine was declared nominated,\r\nand “the result was made unanimous with enthusiasm and mutual\r\ncongratulations.” He was brought in, and with something of sober\r\ndiction, evidently feeling the greatness of the honor and the\r\nresponsibility upon him, he only pledged his best intentions and most\r\nearnest efforts to serve the constituency of the district to the best\r\nof his ability, should he be elected.\r\n\r\n“If so, I shall go with a determination to stand heartily and\r\nunreservedly by the administration of Abraham Lincoln. In the success\r\nof that administration, in the good providence of God, rests, I\r\nsolemnly believe, the fate of the Union.\r\n\r\n“Perish all things else,” he exclaims, “the nation’s life must be\r\nsaved. If slavery or any other institution stands in the way, it must\r\nbe removed. I think the loyal masses are rapidly adopting the idea that\r\nto smite the rebellion, its malignant cause must be smitten. Perhaps\r\nwe are slow in coming to it, and it may be even now we are receiving\r\nour severe chastisement for not more readily accepting the teachings of\r\nProvidence.\r\n\r\n“It was the tenth plague which softened the heart of Pharaoh and caused\r\nhim to let the oppressed go free. That plague was the sacrificing\r\nof the first-born in every household, and with the sanguinary\r\nbattle-fields, whose records of death we are just reading, I ask you\r\nin the language of another, how far off are we from the day when our\r\nhouseholds will have paid that penalty to offended heaven?”\r\n\r\nAfter his nomination Mr. Blaine went on a short visit to his old home\r\nin Washington, Penn. His mother was still living; many friends and\r\nrelatives, beside business interests, demanding attention. He had been\r\ngone but eight years, and four of them he had spent in the legislature,\r\nand now was nominated for congress, with a certainty of election. He\r\nhad come on a visit to the old scenes of childhood, and early manhood,\r\nand could present himself to them as he soon did to the nation, covered\r\nwith honor.\r\n\r\nHe returned just in time to attend a great mass-meeting in Augusta.\r\nThe two calls for troops, each for three hundred thousand, were out.\r\nSenator Lot M. Morrill, a brother of the ex-governor, had just made a\r\nstrong speech, saying “we have been playing at arms before, but now\r\nwe are going to fight,” etc., and closed, when there were loud calls\r\nfor Blaine, and he appeared, burning with enthusiasm, and kindled all\r\nhearts with his presence and patriotic appeals.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, Sept. 8, 1862, Mr. Blaine was first elected to congress.\r\nAlthough it was a state campaign in which he was elected, conducted by\r\nMr. Blaine in person, aided by able lieutenants and a governor,--five\r\ncongressmen and a host of minor officials were to be elected,--the work\r\nwas prosecuted with vigor.\r\n\r\nA draft is threatened. Maine’s quota must be filled, and it was during\r\nthis same month of September the Emancipation Proclamation appeared,\r\nand two months later General McClellan was relieved, and General\r\nBurnside put in command of the army of the Potomac.\r\n\r\nThe great events of national importance would of course over-shadow\r\nall state matters of minor importance, comparatively, and to which\r\nthe public mind was accustomed. Beside, the mind and heart of the new\r\ncongressman were full of the nation’s interest. Women were going to the\r\nfront as nurses,--more than forty had gone from one town in Maine; the\r\nMississippi was open now clear to the Gulf; General Butler was in New\r\nOrleans. Volumes of history were made in a day, much of it unwritten\r\nhistory, traced only in saddened faces, swollen, tearful eyes, in\r\nnights of watchings, in sobs and sighs, and long farewells, in fields\r\nbillowed with mounds, and in the dark shadows that even now will not\r\nbe chased away from many a heart, from many a hearth-stone. How little\r\nis ever heard or known of the dark dreamings still of a multitude all\r\nsilent and alone, when night is on the earth.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine encountered one of the hard-headed men, yet men of harder\r\nhearts, during his campaign up in Clinton township, a hard, Democratic\r\nhold. General Logan used to call them copperheads down in southern\r\nIllinois during the war. They have mostly emigrated since then. At the\r\nclose of the speech one of them arose up and said,--a fellow of grizzly\r\nbeard,\r\n\r\n“Well, young man, you’ve made a right smart speech, but if it is a sin\r\nto hold slaves, how about Gineral Washington?”\r\n\r\nThis was one of Mr. Blaine’s strong points, to answer questions, and so\r\nkeep up a running fire through his speech. He has lately told us how he\r\nenjoyed, not so much to turn the tables on the questioner, as to get at\r\nthe minds of the people, and then turn on the light just where it is\r\nneeded. But to this brave fellow up in Clinton, he quietly replied,\r\n\r\n“Yes, but General Washington manumitted his slaves before he died.”\r\n\r\n“Manu, what?”\r\n\r\n“Manumitted them, set them free, gave them their liberty.”\r\n\r\n“O yes,” and the man sat down.\r\n\r\nIn his stump speeches effectiveness is his chief object, and he strives\r\nwith all the power in him to conquer his foe, and is fully determined\r\nto do it. He ascertains his weak point, and assaults him there. He does\r\nnot apply his battering-ram all over the wall, but on that particular\r\nplace of weakness. He sees the strong points, and has been noted for\r\nhis ability to see almost at a glance, the strong and weak points of\r\na bill. This has served him when canvassing for large majorities. He\r\nwould study the enemy thoroughly, know him without mistake, beyond the\r\npossibility of ambush or surprise, and then enlist his own forces, and\r\nenough of them without fail for certain victory, organize them for\r\nsomething more than simple victory, plan the battle, and then call no\r\nhalt until the work was done. None can be more elegant or choice and\r\nbeautiful in the use of language when occasion requires, but in the\r\ncanvas the great elements of style are plainness, great plainness, and\r\nforce, tremendous force.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine was a Republican before there was a party, and has fought,\r\nand written, and argued, and plead for all the great interests its\r\nexistence has subserved, and of which it is the conservator to-day.\r\nThat eternal vigilance which is the price of liberty, is not to be kept\r\nup on picket posts or parapets, but where laws are made and judged\r\nand executed. He learned his tactics in the war times, and up to the\r\nlast experience in the House, he fought those he felt were traitors\r\nstill and tried to crush him; and who shall not say that in point and\r\nfact the South has ruled the South the past fifteen years, as truly as\r\nthough they were a separate people,--solid, separate, and distinct.\r\n\r\nWhen elected to congress a great work opened up before Mr. Blaine.\r\nIt was the work of preparation. His old methods of thoroughness\r\nmust prevail; mastery must be his watchword still. Augusta was not\r\nWashington; Kennebec county was not the District of Columbia; Maine was\r\nnot the nation, nor the state legislature the congress of the nation.\r\nThe resources that gave him prominence and power in one sphere, would\r\nbe but a small fortune in the other. This history of congress must be\r\ndeeply studied, the history of men and of measures. He must know all.\r\nThere may be dark spots on the sun, but must be none in his mind. They\r\nmay be necessary there, but not here. The charge of ignorance must not\r\nbe his. The craving to know devours all before it. Just over there\r\nin New Hampshire is the warning of Franklin Pierce, great in his own\r\nstate, but little out in the nation. This is before him; but this is\r\nnot the incentive. It is rather the habit of his life to touch bottom,\r\nand sides, and top.\r\n\r\nThis was sacred honor to him, to carry into a place or position to\r\nwhich he is called, what will fill it, or not to enter. So now he\r\ngives the winter largely to this work. It is sacred work to him.\r\nManliness demands it; self-respect makes it imperative. But he loves\r\nit. It is opportunity to him. And surely with all his former years of\r\nconquest, no one ever came to such task with more of fitness for the\r\ntask.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, though flushed with victory from other fields, the echo of the\r\npeople’s cheers still ringing in his heart, and their laurels unfaded\r\non his brow, he feels, he knows there is a lack of that strength and\r\nfulness which have ever been to him the harbingers of victory.\r\n\r\nHow many have run through congress much as they ran for congress,\r\nbecause they took it for granted that preparation for a law office\r\nor a stump speech was preparation for congress; just as many a\r\ndeluded theorist has drifted from college out into life, dreaming\r\nthat preparation for a senior examination was preparation for the\r\ncompetition of life.\r\n\r\nThere was ever a charm to Mr. Blaine about the study of character.\r\nGov. Abner Coburn was Mr. Blaine’s ideal of a business man. He loved\r\nanything large and grand in human nature, and anybody good and true,\r\nand Abner Coburn,--as a man of great ability, of great wealth and\r\nliberality, giving away fifty thousand dollars at a time, and withal a\r\nnoble Christian gentleman,--was to him among the best and worthiest.\r\n\r\nHe loved characters if at all remarkable for hard common sense, and\r\nso he loved to meet and talk with one Miles Standish, from way up in\r\nSomerset county, at Flagstaff Plantation. Plantations abound in the\r\nstate of Maine. There are twenty-five of them in Aroostook county,\r\nwhich is said to be as large as the state of Massachusetts. These\r\nplantations are a mild form of government, rather below the usual\r\ntownship organization, and yet covering a township of land six miles\r\nsquare.\r\n\r\nThis Mr. Standish used frequently to come to Augusta, and it was a\r\npleasant hour for Mr. Blaine to meet him. He was human nature in crude\r\nstate, or in the original package. Unspoiled by art, or science, or\r\nphilosophy, and yet full of quaint, original ideas, and quainter forms\r\nof expression. He was never in a hurry when he met him, and yet it\r\nwas not for sport or fun at his expense, but for the boldness of his\r\npersonality, and the rocky-like substance of his character.\r\n\r\nThis was a great part of his effort in life to understand men, to know\r\nthem, and a high authority has defined just this as common sense. To\r\nknow a man, says the distinguished scholar referred to, is knowledge,\r\nbut to know men, that is common sense. It lets one out of a thousand\r\nblunders and into a thousand secrets; it gives one the science of\r\ncharacter-building, as one may have the science of architecture. It\r\nis a study of the higher sciences, such as moral and mental, in their\r\noriginal sources.\r\n\r\nRight here is the open letter of Mr. Blaine’s career. First, he knows\r\nthe strong points, and then he knows the weak points, and he has his\r\nman every time, for he certainly has a key that will unlock him, only\r\nlet him know what one to use. And it is not a matter of artful, politic\r\nchicanery, and legerdemain. He simply studies the individual, and then\r\nwith ease of manner and a wise, discriminating grace of diction, adapts\r\nor adjusts himself to them. Thomas Carlyle would use a hurricane, it is\r\nsaid, to waft a feather; Mr. Blaine would never.\r\n\r\nAnd again Carlyle employed the weight of his mighty genius to emphasize\r\nthe sumless worth of a man, and yet he did not have common sense\r\nsufficient to treat half who called upon him with common civility. What\r\navails this solemn prating, impoverishing the lexicon and wearying\r\ngenius to express a cynical, over-wrought view of man in his high-born\r\ngreatness, if, when Ralph Waldo Emerson crosses the Atlantic and calls\r\nupon him with compliments of the highest order, he receives only\r\nreplies that sting, and burn, and rankle?\r\n\r\nExactly the reverse of Carlyle has been the method of Mr. Blaine. Men\r\nhave been his glory, his study, and delight. This was his first work\r\nin Augusta, his first work in the state legislature, his first work in\r\ncongress. And not their names alone, but their political history, their\r\npedigree,--all about them. They must all be weighed and measured, sized\r\nand classified. And he must know himself as well, and how far he can\r\nreach, and how firm he can grasp, and how much he can lift. He uses\r\nonly the powers of his personality, and these must all be toned and\r\ntempered anew.\r\n\r\nHe has gone to congress to stay, and not to experiment, but for the\r\nwork of life. He carries with him just the power to get the power which\r\nhe shall need,--the seed-corn for the large, abundant harvest. But he\r\nmust work and cultivate, and this he knows right well how to do, and so\r\nhe does and will. It is his purpose, and that purpose is fixed.\r\n\r\nRight well he knows that there is no power that causes growth\r\nlike contact with strong, determined personalities,--intelligent,\r\nconscientious, affectionate, purposeful. It is mind that makes mind\r\ngrow, that plants the seeds and brings on the harvest by the shining of\r\nits light; and so heart by getting into heart, expands it and causes\r\ngrowth, and conscience rouses conscience, and will awakens will, and\r\nall cause growth. He has not forgotten those lifts out of childhood\r\nalmost into manhood, when the great faces of Jackson, Harrison,\r\nand Clay shone upon him, and now he is the friend and confident of\r\nthe great Lincoln, and they are to be within an evening’s call,\r\nand the great men of the nation are there and will soon be etched,\r\nphotographed, or painted, and hung up within the gallery of his large\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\nENTERING CONGRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is said that life in Washington is a liberal education, social\r\nlife in particular, but public life as well. The great interests of\r\nthe nation center there, and all nations are represented there. Life\r\nis intense in all respects. Victors gather there from all fields of\r\ncontest. They are at their best, and have multitudes to cheer them on,\r\nor cry them down, if they fail or falter. The door of prosperity to\r\nthe country hinges there; defective legislation closes it, and mars\r\nthe delicately balanced confidence in the business world. It is the\r\nnation’s higher school of politics, or rather university, with all its\r\ngreat departments. Graduates from all the state academies are there,\r\ntaking observations of the nation and the world, discussing all live\r\nquestions, following out great lines of thought, fixing policies,\r\nframing laws and enacting them. The arts and sciences flourish there,\r\nscholars congregate from all parts of the land. To them it is a place\r\nof mighty interests; institutions and libraries abound, history is\r\nmanufactured day by day. Strong men in pride and power are in their\r\nglory there.\r\n\r\nSociety is like a myriad-sided palace, with many a gate of entrance and\r\nof exit, but all most deftly closed except to bearer of the keys,--a\r\npalace filled with light of knowledge, and resplendent with beauty;\r\nthe goal of every clique and clan the nation over, where all the\r\naristocracies of the Republic may glow and shine and shine and glow,\r\nand all the courtiers of all the nations mingle in magnificent and\r\npompous array. Guards are at every door. Passports are in demand.\r\n\r\nAt twelve o’clock, the 7th of December, 1863, Mr. Blaine was in his\r\nseat. His heart beat high, his hopes were great. Earnest faces of\r\ndetermined men were all about him. The administration had a clear\r\nworking majority, but there could scarcely have been seventeen\r\nDemocrats from New York to fourteen Union Republicans, had not one\r\nhundred and fifty thousand men been at the front from that state,\r\nand not permitted to vote until the presidential election. And so\r\nwith Lincoln’s own state of Illinois, which just before the war gave\r\nhim such a great majority, now sends nine Democrats to five Union\r\nRepublicans to congress, and has over one hundred thousand men in the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nIn the Pennsylvania delegation the result is similar, though the\r\nadministration is endorsed by six thousand two hundred and thirty-one\r\nmajority,--which would have been vastly increased if her one hundred\r\nthousand soldiers had been permitted to vote, as they were a year or\r\ntwo later.\r\n\r\nOut of figures sent from the field then were shown to be five thousand\r\ntwo hundred and sixty-seven Republican votes in a total ballot of seven\r\nthousand one hundred and twenty-two, in over thirty organizations; but\r\nmost of these were from Iowa, a state with such Republican majorities\r\nthat when Mr. Blaine was urged to speak there during the campaign of\r\n1876, replied,\r\n\r\n“What is the use of burnishing gold?”\r\n\r\nBut there had been a vast amount of political light spread over that\r\nstate during the years that intervened from 1862 and ’63 to 1876.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine had spent a year as a quiet observer and a deep and diligent\r\nstudent since his election in September, 1862.\r\n\r\nNo course could have been wiser than the one adopted by Mr. Blaine.\r\nNone from the state was more popular, and so none had a heavier\r\ncorrespondence. It related to all departments of the government, and he\r\nmust at once gain influence in all. And this he did, with the greatest\r\ncertainty of results. He was most obliging. It was soon found out, and\r\nall parties, without respect to politics, wrote him for favors of\r\nvarious characters, and they never appealed in vain.\r\n\r\nA Democrat of the deepest dye, a malignant enemy of Mr. Blaine\r\npolitically, had a son in the army who had deserted, was tried by a\r\ncourt-martial, found guilty, and condemned to be shot, according to the\r\narmy law in such cases. The father appealed to Mr. Blaine to use his\r\ngood offices with the great-hearted president in behalf of his son’s\r\nrelease.\r\n\r\nTrue to his instincts as a man, and his fidelity in all matters of\r\npublic trust, utterly destitute of a prejudice, and without a particle\r\nof enmity to curdle the milk of human kindness by its lightning-stroke,\r\nto poison his motive or weaken his purpose to truly represent the\r\npeople, he went at once to Mr. Lincoln, and so presented the facts, and\r\nplead for the life of the young man, that the pardon was granted, and\r\nhe was transferred from the guard-house to his place in the regiment at\r\nthe front.\r\n\r\nAnd it is a simple fact that a brother of that same young man hooted\r\nthe nomination of Mr. Blaine recently upon the streets of Augusta. So\r\nlittle does gratitude hold sway in the breasts of some!\r\n\r\nIt is a singular coincidence that Mr. Blaine and Mr. Garfield had\r\nentered so nearly together, and both so nearly of an age; but they\r\nwere both great students, and ready for the service required at their\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nSome have said that Mr. Blaine spent his first term in congress in\r\nquiet observation, without being read, seen, or heard. This would\r\nnot be his nature. He would not be there if he was to be simply an\r\nonlooker. This he could be from the galleries. Such a course would be\r\ncrucifixion, and an acknowledgment of inefficiency and incompetency.\r\nWithin two weeks after entrance we find him participating in debate.\r\n\r\nThe secretary of war had sent a note to the Committee on Ways and\r\nMeans, requesting an immediate appropriation of twenty million dollars\r\nfor bounties, to encourage more rapid enlistment. The chairman had\r\nreported the item at once, and there was no delay in calling it up, and\r\nin its discussion he took part. His first resolution related to the\r\nprompt payment of prize-money to the officers and seamen of the navy,\r\nand was offered Jan. 6, 1864.\r\n\r\nSix days after he rose to oppose the views of the chairman of the\r\nWays and Means Committee in appropriating seven hundred thousand\r\ndollars to pay a Pennsylvania claim only six months old, when claims\r\nfiled eighteen months before by the state of Maine were unpaid. It\r\nwas a claim for enlisting, arming, and organizing troops to guard the\r\nnavy-yard and coast at Kittery and Portsmouth when cruisers endangered\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nOn April 21st Mr. Blaine presented his first bill, having reference to\r\nthis same subject of war-claims of the state against the nation, the\r\nsubject having remained in an unsettled condition. His bill is a model\r\nof excellence, providing for a commission of three, appointed by the\r\npresident, to receive, examine, and endorse state claims, etc., against\r\nthe general government, and order the payment of the same, after a\r\nspecified time fixed in the future, so heavy were the drafts then upon\r\nthe national treasury. He supported the measure with a speech of great\r\nbreadth of view and comprehensiveness of statement, occupying ten\r\ncolumns of the _Congressional Globe_. Mr. Hamilton’s refunding measure,\r\nafter the war of the Revolution, was used in argument, and also the\r\nadoption of similar measures after the war with England in 1812 to ’15,\r\nand also the Mexican war.\r\n\r\nHe was replied to by Mr. Dawes of Massachusetts, and a general debate\r\nensued. He had now fairly entered upon his congressional career, and\r\nseems to have come with a bound into a position that numbered him\r\nat once with the leading members. He was easily at the head of his\r\ndelegation; he commanded the attention of the House, which some members\r\nnever do. He was recognized, assented to, opposed in person and\r\nparticulars, co-operated with, and in various ways was it manifest that\r\nhe had gained in a session what never comes to many members.\r\n\r\nWe find his resolutions and amendments passing; his points of order\r\nsustained. He is referred to on over fifty pages of the _Congressional\r\nGlobe_, in remarks, resolutions, amendments, bills, etc. He has\r\nsomething to say on all great measures of importance that come before\r\nthe House. He shows himself at home upon all the questions receiving\r\nattention, and watches the drift of proceedings with close and careful\r\neye, and shows an abiding interest in all that is going on. The matter\r\nin hand seems ever to be just the matter in his mind. He is from the\r\nstart a “working-member.” There are members who are not classed as\r\nworking-members. They listen and look on; work does not agree with\r\nthem; they do not like it. They have an equal chance with all the\r\nothers, but they are afraid to speak out; to take a position and defend\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIntelligence is an important factor in such a man, and it is hardly\r\nwise or best for a man, although he is a member, to “speak out in\r\nmeeting” unless he surely has something to say and knows how to say it,\r\nand can really get it off, and to the point. Men may go into battle\r\nby regiments, brigades, corps, and divisions, and no man flinch; but\r\nthey do not act that way on the floor of congress. It is worse than\r\na battle-field in some respects; takes courage of a different type.\r\nThey must go in alone, and fire away, with several hundred keen eyes\r\nupon them. They will quale and tremble, falter and trip in a little\r\nsentence, and stand there, pale and blanched with fear, while the same\r\none might mount a horse and charge into hottest battle, midst fearful\r\ncarnage, with the tinge of highest courage mantling cheek and brow.\r\n\r\nIn his eloquent eulogy of Mr. Garfield, Mr. Blaine says: “There is no\r\ntest of a man’s ability in any department of public life more severe\r\nthan service in the House of Representatives. There is no place where\r\nso little deference is paid to reputation previously acquired, or to\r\neminence won outside; no place where so little consideration is shown\r\nfor the feelings or failures of beginners. What a man gains in the\r\nHouse, he gains by sheer force of his own character, and if he loses\r\nand falls back he must expect no mercy, and will receive no sympathy.\r\nIt is a field in which the survival of the strongest is the recognized\r\nrule, and where no pretense can deceive, and no glamour can mislead.\r\nThe real man is discovered, his worth is impartially weighed, and his\r\nrank is irreversibly decreed.”\r\n\r\nA long and strong experience had convinced him of the deep, historic\r\ntruth of this utterance. The challenge seemed constantly to be, “What\r\nare you doing here?” The waves dashed high, and the undertow was\r\ndreadful. One can easily read between the lines the battle Mr. Blaine\r\nhad with himself at his first rising in the House, which was simply to\r\nread in evidence on the pending discussion a few sentences from the\r\nreport of the secretary of the treasury, he was met by a slight rebuff\r\nfrom old General Schenk of Ohio, to the effect that the matter was\r\nirrelevant.\r\n\r\nHe was not Mr. Speaker any more, and felt the newness of his situation,\r\nbut he belonged there, and he proposed to whip and win, and so he sets\r\nhimself to work to draft a bill, and works, and watches his opportunity\r\nfor four months, and not until December 21st is lost in April 21st does\r\njust his opportunity come; but when it came he showed by a speech of\r\nnearly two hours in length, full of hard, solid facts, arguments forged\r\nwith something of the weight and power of thunderbolts, bristling\r\nwith statistics, and fairly boiling with his richest and most fervid\r\neloquence, that he knew his rights, and knowing, dared maintain them.\r\nAnd it was in discussing this same bill on which he and Schenk had\r\nspoken, and which had kept afloat, or anchored in the House in various\r\nforms of bill, resolve, or amendment, that he won his spurs in this\r\nsplendid speech. He did not let it come to final passage until he had\r\nshown his power of relevancy, and convinced the General from Ohio that\r\nmen were not elected speakers up in Maine until they could fairly\r\ndiscriminate between tweedle de and tweedle dum.\r\n\r\nMeantime, what he said of Garfield is true of him: “He stepped to the\r\nfront with the confidence of one who belonged there.”\r\n\r\nNineteen of those who sat with Mr. Blaine when he first took his place\r\nin the House, have been chosen United States senators since then.\r\nMany served well as governors, and many in the foreign service of\r\ntheir country. “But among them all, none grew more rapidly; none more\r\nfirmly,” are his words of that other one, but they are just as true of\r\nhimself. His early course in congress was marked by great courage and\r\npersistency.\r\n\r\nTwo others had failed to secure the adoption of an amendment to the\r\nbill for the establishment of national banks, to the effect that\r\ninterest should be uniform when not fixed by state law, and though\r\nit had been voted on and defeated before; though its form had been\r\nchanged, yet seeing the wisdom of it, and having the courage of his\r\nconviction, he moved it again, and made a short, ringing speech of not\r\nover fifteen minutes, and it was carried by a vote of sixty-nine to\r\nthirty-one. Such power to control legislation so soon after entering\r\ncongress, clearly reveals the influence already gained.\r\n\r\nShortly after this, when the committee on the penitentiary in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia reported a bill appropriating two hundred and\r\nfifty thousand dollars for the purpose, he was ready to oppose. He\r\nhad been one of the chairmen of the prison committee in the Maine\r\nlegislature, had been on a committee or commission appointed by\r\nthe governor to visit prisons elsewhere and gain full information\r\nconcerning them, having, with his customary energy and thoroughness,\r\nvisited seventeen, and found they were being run at great expense to\r\nthe several states, and so he opposed the bill, as prisoners were\r\nbeing kept safely in prisons already established, and, as he said,\r\nthe proposed amount would only start the work and make many hundred\r\nthousands a necessity.\r\n\r\nWhatever the question of national or state importance that came before\r\nthe House, he had made himself familiar with it. And so we find him\r\nspeaking on the revenue, conscription, and currency bills; legislative\r\nappropriation and tariff bills; the Fugitive Slave Law and the civil\r\nappropriation bills, beside the bill relating to Pennsylvania\r\nwar-expenses. The terrible battle of Gettysburgh had been fought the\r\nsummer before, and the state heavily involved, and the effort was to\r\nhave her re-imbursed.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine was heartily on the side of the administration and the war,\r\nsupporting the various measures of prosecution and relief as against\r\nthe opposition, with all the power in him. But it was not a blind\r\nsupport. It must be wise, intelligent, and discriminating, to put\r\nhim in the fullest action, and bring on what might so soon be termed\r\naccustomed triumph.\r\n\r\nBut there came a day on the twenty-first of June, and during the first\r\nsession of his first congress,--the thirty-eighth,--that a bill came\r\ninto the House embodying a report from James B. Fry provost-marshal\r\ngeneral, endorsed definitely by Edwin M. Stanton, secretary of war,\r\nand concurred in by Abraham Lincoln, proclaiming the conscription act\r\na failure. The bill had come from the committee on military affairs,\r\nthrough their chairman. The exact point in the bill that had proved\r\nobjectionable, and which they desired expunged, was what is known\r\nas the three hundred dollar clause, enabling any drafted man by the\r\npayment of the above sum to procure a substitute, and so be relieved\r\nhimself. This very feature of the bill Mr. Blaine had incorporated as\r\nhis first amendment offered in congress, and enforced by a vigorous\r\nspeech, which carried it through, and now a repeal of it would compel\r\nany business man in the country, if drafted, to go at once, provided\r\nonly he was fit for military service. This would take the best\r\nphysician, with the largest practice, in the greatest city of the Union.\r\n\r\n“Such a conscription,” said Mr. Blaine, “was never resorted to but\r\nonce, even in the French Empire, under the absolutism of the First\r\nNapoleon; and for the congress of the United States to attempt its\r\nenforcement upon their constituents is to ignore the best principles of\r\nrepublican representative government.”\r\n\r\nRemarkable as it may seem, and specially so in view of the fact that he\r\nhad but fifteen minutes granted him to speak, his motion prevailed by\r\na vote of one hundred to fifty. Such men as Boutwell, Brooks, Dawes,\r\nMcDowell, Edward H. Rollins, Schofield, Wadsworth, and Wheeler, stood\r\nwith him. Mr. Stanton’s idea was that by forcing into the field a great\r\narmy of soldiers the war might be speedily terminated. But freemen\r\ncannot be dealt with as slaves. There is a vast difference between the\r\npurely military and the truly civil view of a question.\r\n\r\nA few days after the same bill was up again, for further repairs, when\r\nwe get a fine view of Mr. Blaine. It was Saturday afternoon, June 25,\r\n1864. Mr. Mallory, of Kentucky, was making a long speech against the\r\nfeature of the bill that provided for enlisting the negro, when he\r\nobserved Mr. Blaine watching him. He said,--\r\n\r\n“My friend from Maine (Mr. Blaine), who seems to be listening so\r\nattentively, lived in Kentucky once, and knows the negro and his\r\nattributes, and he knows, if he will tell you what he knows, that they\r\nwon’t fight.”\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine: “From a residence of five years in Kentucky, I came to the\r\nconclusion from what I saw of the negroes, that there was a good deal\r\nof fight in them.”\r\n\r\nAfter a pleasant colloquy, he went on to state that during the Crimean\r\nwar Egypt furnished Turkey fifteen regiments of negroes of pure blood,\r\nunmixed from the foundation of the world, and as good troops as ever\r\nmarched upon European soil. And so the debate went on. One thing\r\nseems quite evident: Mr. Blaine had come to feel perfectly at home\r\non the floor of the House. His quiet ways and quick-witted replies;\r\nthe conversational character of the proceedings at times, in which\r\nhe participates; his familiarity with men and their almost constant\r\nrecognition of him; the fluent and undisturbed character of his\r\nsentences; the general ease and pleasure of the man, and the home-like\r\nair that seems constantly to surround him, show that he is in his\r\nelement. But he is always there, and very attentive, keeping up with\r\nthe great debates as they are carried on day after day. Nothing seems\r\nto escape him, and every move is a cautious one. Even then he must have\r\nbeen the pride of his state.\r\n\r\nHe had not listened so attentively to the speech of the Kentuckian,\r\nMr. Mallory, for naught, in which it was asserted that Mr. Lincoln\r\nissued the Emancipation Proclamation in consequence of pressure brought\r\nto bear upon him by a meeting of governors of the loyal states,\r\nat Altoona, Penn., the autumn of 1862. Having armed himself with\r\ndocumentary proof, so that he might be doubly sure, though his memory\r\ntold him he was right, he thus corners the gentleman in the neatest\r\nmanner possible.\r\n\r\n“I understood the gentleman (Mr. Mallory, of Kentucky) to assert,”\r\nsaid Mr. Blaine, “and to reiterate with great emphasis, that the\r\nEmancipation Proclamation was issued in consequence of the pressure\r\nbrought to bear upon the president by the meeting of the governors at\r\nAltoona, in the autumn of 1862.”\r\n\r\nMr. Mallory. “I said it was issued in consequence of the pressure\r\nbrought to bear by these governors.”\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine. “Will the gentleman state at what date the president’s\r\nproclamation was issued?”\r\n\r\nMr. Mallory. “On the 22d of September.”\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine. “Will the gentleman state further at what date the meeting\r\nof the governors took place at Altoona?”\r\n\r\nMr. Mallory. “Some days before.”\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine. “Not at all, sir. That meeting was on the 24th of\r\nSeptember, two days after the proclamation was issued.”\r\n\r\nMr. Mallory. “Oh, no.”\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine. “Yes, sir; I am correct. I had a personal recollection of\r\nthe date, and I have further certified it by documentary evidence,\r\nwhich I sent for and now hold in my hand.”\r\n\r\nOf course the man squirmed and tried to escape, but he was held by\r\na firm hand to the grave discrepancy of which he had been guilty,\r\ninvolving the governors of all the loyal states in an instigation of\r\nwhich they were guiltless as a body of men, in convention assembled.\r\nThen he tried to escape by asserting that the governors were on at\r\nWashington, laboring with the president to secure the same end. But he\r\nwas assured most emphatically, that such was not the case, as they all\r\nwere extremely busy, and no time for a week’s excursion to Washington.\r\n\r\nGovernor Washburn, of Maine, had invited Mr. Blaine to accompany him\r\nto this meeting of the governors, but pressure of duties forbade.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine closed the little contest for supremacy, with the Kentucky\r\ngentleman, with this single sentence: “The anachronism into which my\r\nfriend has been led, and which I have thus pointed out, is quite as\r\nconclusive in the premises as Mr. Weller hoped the alibi would prove in\r\nthe celebrated Pickwickian trial.”\r\n\r\nA pleasant thing about the episode is that Mr. Boutwell, of\r\nMassachusetts, afterwards President Grant’s secretary of the treasury,\r\nyielded his own time upon the floor to Mr. Blaine, for the friendly\r\ntilt in the interest of the Union, and the pending war-measure.\r\n\r\nIt proved conclusively that congress is no place for a Fourth of July\r\noration, but for clear heads, well-managed tongues, and brave hearts,\r\nsuch as Mr. Blaine seems never to be without.\r\n\r\nA long session of congress was being held on into the middle of summer,\r\nand many of the old laws relating to slavery were being abolished,\r\namong them one that related to the coastwise slave trade, which was\r\ninterlaced with the coastwise trade of rightful commerce. It comprised\r\nthirty-two sections, so bound up together as to make a sort of a\r\ncode on the subject. It, of course, bore directly upon the shipping\r\ninterests of Maine, and brought Mr. Blaine to his feet more than\r\nonce during the discussion. The effort was made to revise them in the\r\ninterest of New York city, and so discriminate sharply against New\r\nEngland ports. The condition of that city, at this time, was very bad\r\npolitically. It was about the time of the draft-riots, when Tilden\r\naddressed the mob, calling the rioters “My friends.” Of course Mr.\r\nBlaine was thoroughly informed, and he made a strong point against the\r\nmeasure of the New York member, Mr. Brooks. “To-day,” he said, “in New\r\nYork city, the sentiment is anti-American, and were it submitted to\r\nvoters of the city of New York now, whether they would have Jeff Davis\r\npresident, or a loyal Republican Union man, North, Jeff Davis would\r\nhave thirty thousand votes ahead,” and a voice said, “What of that?”\r\nAnd Mr. Brooks, the gentleman from New York, admitted that there were\r\nfifty thousand majority now in New York city opposed to Abraham Lincoln.\r\n\r\nThis was six months and seven days after the Proclamation of\r\nEmancipation, and showed that, though the great heart of that noble\r\nstate beat true, and, as was a fact, had sent about two hundred\r\nthousand troops to the war, yet the mass in the city, left behind, were\r\nweakening largely the Union cause. It was a feature of the struggle\r\nwith slavery continually felt, not only in congress, but in the\r\nexecution of laws for the strengthening of the cause.\r\n\r\nIn reply to “What of that?”--that is, what of it if Jeff Davis could\r\nreceive thirty thousand majority in New York city--he said: “Just this:\r\nif gentlemen suppose that the whole country will contribute to the\r\nprosperity and growth of the city under such circumstances, they are\r\nunder a perfect delusion,” and then he went for the man who said “What\r\nof that?” in his own princely style.\r\n\r\nHe encounters first “Sunset” Cox, then of Ohio, now of New York, the\r\nwit of the House, and there is a perfect fusilade of questionings and\r\nreplies, sharp retorts and pertinent sallies, and though they are after\r\nhim from all sides, Cox, Randall, Arnold, Brooks, yet he holds his\r\nposition with a fearless hand, standing firm as an admiral on the deck\r\nof his flag-ship in the squadron, amid the boom and smoke, the thunder,\r\nand flash, and roar of a naval engagement; just as intrepid, just as\r\ngrand; no twitching of nerve, or faltering of muscle; he is commander\r\nof the situation, and never strikes his flag.\r\n\r\nNearly a month before the adjournment of congress the Union National\r\nRepublican Convention met at Baltimore (June 7), to nominate a\r\npresident.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln had been regarded as too conservative by the extreme\r\nradical wing of the party, notwithstanding the slaves were free, and\r\narmed, and organized by the thousands in defence of the Union; and\r\nGrant had been so successful in the West, he had been brought East\r\nand made lieutenant-general, having fought his way from Fort Henry to\r\nPittsburgh Landing, to Vicksburg, and to Chattanooga. But the war had\r\nbeen prolonged beyond the expectation of the people. Rebels were still\r\non the banks of the Rappahannock and the Tennessee. A few defeats, loss\r\nof men, great expenditures of money, and a rather dormant campaign\r\nduring the winter, had produced some despondency and doubt.\r\n\r\nSecretary Chase, with his powerful position in the cabinet and at the\r\nhead of the treasury, was known to be seeking the presidency, and so he\r\nbecame the centre around which clustered various elements of discontent\r\nand opposition. He was the head, it is said, of the radical forces in\r\nthe cabinet, as Mr. Seward was of the conservative forces. But though\r\na man of great prominence, and of great power, a man with a splendid\r\nrecord as a political chief of the Free-soil party that had battled\r\nslavery before the war, his legislature of Ohio pronounced for Mr.\r\nLincoln, and Mr. Chase at once withdrew.\r\n\r\nBut everything was at fever-heat. The “radical men of the nation” were\r\ninvited to meet at Cleveland on the 31st of May, eight days before\r\nthe Republican Convention met at Baltimore. “It was simply a mass\r\nconvention of one hundred and fifty persons, claiming to come from\r\nfifteen states.” General Frémont was put forward as candidate for\r\npresident, and Gen. John Cochrane, of New York, for vice-president, and\r\nall in violent opposition to Mr. Lincoln, as the call indicated, and\r\nGeneral Frémont’s letter of acceptance confirmed. If anybody else was\r\nnominated, he would not be a candidate.\r\n\r\nThis was the state of affairs when Mr. Blaine went with his delegation\r\nto Baltimore, where Union troops were first fired upon less than three\r\nyears before.\r\n\r\nIt seems exceeding strange as we look back upon it now, that anyone\r\ncould be found in all the North, and especially among his party,\r\nmen who could oppose a man so great and worthy as Abraham Lincoln,\r\nand even attack the wisdom of his administration and the rectitude\r\nof his intentions, just as some were found to attack Washington,\r\nnotwithstanding the magnitude of his service, the splendor of his life,\r\nand the magnificence of his character.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine was among the staunchest friends of the president, and\r\ncannot look, even from this distance of years, with any respect, upon\r\nthe actions of those who sought to undermine him. He regarded it as\r\nunwise, cruel, and next to disloyalty. But it availed not,--he was too\r\nproudly enthroned amid the affections of the people, so that every\r\neffort of opposition but increased their love and zeal for him, and\r\nmade his nomination, which came in due time, doubly sure.\r\n\r\nThis convention, in which Mr. Blaine bore so signal a part, was\r\nfull of interest, not only for the sake of Mr. Lincoln, but also of\r\nVice-president Hannibal Hamlin, of his own state.\r\n\r\nMany eminent men were included in its roll of delegates. Not less\r\nthan five of the leading war-governors were chosen to participate\r\nin its councils. Vermont sent Solomon Foote, who had stood faithful\r\nin the senate during the struggle before the war. Massachusetts had\r\ncommissioned her eloquent governor, John A. Andrew. Henry J. Raymond,\r\nDaniel S. Dickinson, and Lyman Tremaine were there from New York. New\r\nJersey and Ohio each sent two ex-governors,--Marcus L. Ward and William\r\nA. Newell from the former, and William Dennison and David Tod from\r\nthe latter. Simon Cameron, Thaddeus Stevens, and Ex-Speaker Grow, of\r\nPennsylvania; Governor Blair and Omer D. Conger, of Michigan; Angus\r\nCameron, of Wisconsin, and George W. McCrary, of Iowa, were among the\r\nother delegates.\r\n\r\nGovernor Morgan, of New York, called the convention to order, and Dr.\r\nRobert J. Breckenridge was chosen temporary chairman, who, on taking\r\nthe chair, delivered the great speech of the convention, as Mr. Blaine\r\nthinks. It impressed him deeply, and he refers to it with emotions of\r\nadmiration to-day.\r\n\r\nHe was a tall, sturdy man, of Scotch extraction and advanced in years,\r\nwhich, with his history, inspired reverence. His speech was “sharp,\r\nsinewy, and defiant.” He had been reared amidst Slavery, but was for\r\nthe Union. “The nation shall not be destroyed,” he said. “We shall\r\nchange the Constitution if it suits us to do so. The only enduring,\r\nthe only imperishable cement of all free institutions, has been the\r\nblood of traitors,” he said with thrilling effect; and added regarding\r\nSlavery, “Use all power to exterminate and extinguish it.”\r\n\r\n“Next to the official platform itself,” said Mr. Blaine, “the speech\r\nof Doctor Breckenridge was the most inspiring utterance of the\r\nconvention.” Every vote in the convention was cast for Mr. Lincoln\r\non the first ballot, except twenty-two from Missouri, which, by\r\ninstruction, were cast for General Grant.\r\n\r\nWhen congress adjourned, July 4th, the great campaign opened, and into\r\nit plunged Mr. Blaine with all the fiery ardor of which his nature was\r\ncompetent, and patriotism prompted, and his personal friendship for\r\nMr. Lincoln could inspire.\r\n\r\nGen. George B. McClellan, who had been the idol of the army for\r\ntwo years and a half, was nominated by the Democrats. Mr. Blaine\r\ndenominates it “a canvass of extraordinary interest and critical\r\nimportance.” And such indeed it was, coming as it did right in the\r\nmidst of the great war, when over a million men were in arms on the\r\ncontinent, and the great summer and fall campaigns were to be fought.\r\nIt was, indeed, a critical time for heated discussions, the grinding\r\nof opposition, the friction of parties, constant irritation, not only\r\nat home, throughout every city, village, and hamlet of the North, but\r\nthroughout the army, in every camp and hospital, on the march, at\r\npicket, post, and bivouac,--for the soldiers were to vote.\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, a perilous time. No tongue can tell, no mind can even\r\ndream, the results that would have followed Mr. Lincoln’s defeat; what\r\nreversals of history; what undoing of mighty deeds; what paralysis of\r\nmoral power in the nation; what defeat of principle; what compromise\r\nwith wrong; what stagnation, downfall, death. But it was not to be;\r\nit could not be. High heaven’s decree was otherwise. Incompetence was\r\nnot to be rewarded. The great North, when it spoke out for all the\r\nworld to hear, had no premium to place upon supposed disloyalty. The\r\nold ship of state was not to change captains in mid-ocean; he who had\r\nbrought her by island, and rock, and reef, through storm and tempest,\r\nthrough cyclone and hurricane, safely thus far, was no Jonah, to be\r\ncast overboard now. Few people in all the world can know more clearly,\r\nfeel more deeply, and act more strongly when things thoroughly arouse,\r\nthan the American people, and none have more to rouse them at times.\r\nIndeed, we have the cream of all the nations, and so strike high above\r\nthe average. We heard of “thinking bayonets” back there, and fife, and\r\ndrum, and horn that spoke the thoughts and love of men. The triumph was\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nThere were but twenty-one votes in the electoral college, when autumn\r\ncame, for McClellan, and two hundred and twelve for Mr. Lincoln.\r\nThe decree of a holy Providence had been recorded with an emphasis\r\nas unmistakable as doubtless would have been the case had the Great\r\nEmancipator of Israel been subjected to a test-vote in the wilderness.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that no period of the nation’s history is so bright with\r\nvictories, both civil and military, as the sixty days succeeding the\r\nconvention at Chicago, Aug. 29, 1864, which nominated General McClellan\r\nfor the presidency,--a period in which the labors of Mr. Blaine were\r\nindefatigable for the Union cause, and to which he referred with the\r\nemphasis of a life-time interest.\r\n\r\nThe Democrats voted the war a failure, and then placed its leading\r\ngeneral up to within less than a year before, upon their platform.\r\nAnd yet, while they were declaring the war a failure, the news came\r\nthat Fort Morgan was captured, and Sherman took Atlanta the day after\r\nthey adjourned, and speedily came the successes of Admiral Farragut in\r\nMobile Bay.\r\n\r\nA proclamation of thanksgiving was issued by President Lincoln for\r\nthe great Union victories within two days after they had proposed,\r\npractically, to surrender to traitors; and Secretary Seward said in a\r\npublic speech, “Sherman and Farragut have knocked the planks out of the\r\nChicago platform.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Grant held Lee in a vise at Petersburgh, and Sheridan, within\r\nthree weeks of Sherman’s capture of Atlanta, had dashed down the\r\nShenandoah valley and won three brilliant victories in the battles of\r\nWinchester, Fisher’s Hill, and Cedar Creek.\r\n\r\nThe political effect of these victories was just what Mr. Lincoln had\r\npredicted. “With reverses in the field,” he said, “the case is doubtful\r\nat the polls; but with victory in the field, the election will take\r\ncare of itself.”\r\n\r\nAnd then came the civil victories,--Maine and Vermont in September (and\r\nMr. Blaine was still chairman of the Republican State Central Committee\r\nin Maine, and had to plan the entire campaign, secure speakers, etc.,\r\netc.); then in October, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana, wheeled into\r\nline, and “registered in advance the edict of the people in regard to\r\nthe presidency.”\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine had usually to remain in his own state each summer after the\r\nadjournment of congress, until after the election, and they had one\r\neach year, which occurred the second Monday in September, and as this\r\nwould come from the eighth to the twelfth of the month it gave him from\r\nfifty to sixty days for campaign-work in other states, which, during\r\npresidential years, was fully and heartily improved. He was greatly\r\nsought for, and would draw immense audiences, and kindle an enthusiasm\r\nwhich would blaze and burn, and smoulder, and then blaze forth again.\r\nHis offer of a thousand dollars a line for anything that he has written\r\nthe past year, expressing in any way a desire for the nomination, is\r\nproof that his nomination is but the result of the old smouldering\r\nfires of almost boundless and unquenchable enthusiasm blazing forth\r\nanew. These fires that are burning now have been kindled for ten or\r\ntwenty years, and they have been chiefly lighted during these fifty or\r\nsixty days intervening between September elections in Maine and the\r\nOctober and November elections in other states. While others might go\r\nto the mountains or sea-shore to rest and rust, he would breathe for\r\ntwo or three days, and respond to some of the numerous calls for help\r\nwhere the brunt of battle was heaviest, or the enemy seemed strong and\r\ndesperate.\r\n\r\nHe was always a hard hitter, and never played at politics. It was\r\nbusiness with him, and war. He would wring the neck of a political\r\nheresy with all the gusto an old Scotch Covenanter would experience\r\nin hounding to the death a religious heresy. There is such a thing\r\nas political truth and political virtue to him. It is not fancy and\r\nfoible, chimera and dream, phantasm and fable, but granite truth, and\r\nprinciple rock-like and firm as adamant.\r\n\r\nSomething was fought for in the war, and that something has been worth\r\npreserving, and is to-day.\r\n\r\nIt is Liberty in purest form and on grandest scale this world has\r\never known; the life of all prosperity, the very spirit of peace,\r\nthe inspiration of all development, the law of all growth, and the\r\nharbinger of hope’s brightest anticipations.\r\n\r\nAnd so Mr. Blaine has done his great, best work, not simply in the\r\nlight of glowing idols, but in the glow of great victories achieved,\r\nand the substance of great realities enjoyed, in a mental and moral\r\nrealization; and a country broad, and grand, and free; its great\r\ncities, rivers, forests, lakes, its ocean, mountains, prairies, plains,\r\nand all its five and fifty million people, to him a joy.\r\n\r\nHe takes it in and calls it ours,--the fair inheritance of a people\r\nfree,--for we inherit one another too, in all that constitutes society,\r\ncommunity, city, and country.\r\n\r\nWe said he hit hard, struck out to win. It is true. Each man before him\r\nmust squirm or cheer. There were no lookers on; he had no idle issues,\r\nbut live ones; personal, and things of destiny.\r\n\r\nWhen in Ohio once with Congressman Bingham,--and he did not go that far\r\nfrom home for nothing,--he got up a little political hail-storm for\r\nthe special benefit of the Democrats present. Such a storm is usually\r\nproduced by two dark clouds coming together, heavily charged with the\r\ndouble extract of electricity and other substances. He brought one of\r\nthose clouds with him and manufactured the other one on the spot out of\r\nmaterials in the audience.\r\n\r\nThe result was a good many were hit, and hail hurts when it has a fair\r\nchance to strike, and as that was well aimed it struck square. Among\r\nothers, a man from the “old sod,”--an Irishman,--who had in him what is\r\nrare in Maine,--whiskey,--so after the speaking he made for Mr. Blaine,\r\ndetermined to try his shillalah upon the cranium of the honorable\r\ngentleman, but just as he came up, Bookwalter, who ran for governor,\r\nseized him, and gave him the direction of the comet which did not know\r\nhow it came there, or where it was going. At all events, he did not get\r\nthe whirl, and twist, and buzz out of him in time to find out where he\r\nwas, or Mr. Blaine either, or to reform his purpose and execute it.\r\n\r\nIt is said Henry Clay’s speeches had the most effect at the time they\r\nwere delivered, and that Daniel Webster’s speeches had more effect a\r\nweek afterwards, when people had had time to think them over, than at\r\nthe time they were delivered.\r\n\r\nYou must combine these views to get at the truth regarding Mr. Blaine’s\r\nspeeches. They have tremendous effect when delivered, and great\r\npower afterward. His illustrations, taken right out of daily life,\r\nwould catch and hold the thought, and illuminate the mind, and make\r\nthemselves remembered. They would not let go; like some of the things\r\nthat have clung to us through life, we don’t hold on to them, they hold\r\non themselves.\r\n\r\nA speech we heard from him years ago will never leave us. It was on the\r\ncurrency question, which was discussed for years, and, like Banco’s\r\nghost, would not down.\r\n\r\nHis first sentence will never be forgotten. It was characteristic of\r\nthe man, and expressed a great principle of his political philosophy.\r\nThis was it: “_A thing is never settled until it is settled right._”\r\n\r\nHow true that was of Slavery! how true of the currency question! how\r\ntrue of every great question of moral or religious reform! Until it is\r\nsettled right it is like a piece of glass in the eye, you cannot get it\r\ninto a comfortable position; you move it and arrange and re-arrange it,\r\nand think now that it is fixed for certain, and just as it ceases to\r\nvex you,--like the crooked stick in the fable, so crooked it could not\r\nlie still,--it turns over.\r\n\r\nIn that same speech,--and it moved and swayed thousands then, and\r\nclings to them yet like an influence of magic power, moving and swaying\r\nthem still, in it was a little simple reference to experience he had\r\nin California, and it was before specie payments had been resumed, but\r\nthey were on a gold basis out on the Pacific coast. He had gone into a\r\nbank to get a check of three hundred dollars cashed, and he said, “Give\r\nme gold,” and they gave him gold, and he divided it up and put it in\r\nall his pockets to balance the load, and he went about the city calling\r\nhere and there, going up long stairways, and over great establishments,\r\nand all the while that gold was getting heavier. He would change it\r\nabout and carry some in his hand. It was such a luxury to have gold\r\nand not pay any premium on it. But finally it was too much for him,\r\nand in a sort of desperation he went back to the bank, and asked them\r\nif they would not give him greenbacks for that gold, and the man said\r\n“Yes,” and he took the little roll of greenbacks and put it in his\r\nvest-pocket, and was not bothered any more. He acted out the scene with\r\ndramatic effect. The incident gave all a new love for the greenback,\r\nand less thirst for gold.\r\n\r\nIt was his delight all through that speech to get questions from the\r\naudience, and so settle their difficulties by giving them just the\r\ninformation desired.\r\n\r\nHis power with an audience lay largely in this method of questioning.\r\nHe drew near to them, or rather drew them near to him, was helpful\r\nand kindly; he would stop in his speech and talk with anyone in the\r\naudience that had sensible questions to ask, and so was down to earth\r\nall the time, and not up among the clouds “careering on the gale.”\r\nAnd thus he really did something, really accomplished it, and so made\r\nprogress. He did not fly any eagle, he did not have one along.\r\n\r\nSome grocer or laboring man in the crowd asked a question about the\r\nrevenue on sugar, which Mr. Blaine did not get at first, and an\r\naristocrat on the platform said, “O, never mind him, go on with your\r\nspeech,” but he had said “What,” and was eagerly listening to get the\r\nman’s thought, and said quickly to the honorable gentleman, “Keep\r\nstill,” and waved his hand back at him to keep quiet, and he heard the\r\nlaboring man’s question fairly, and answered it, too.\r\n\r\nIt made all respect him the more, and beside, that was his speech. It\r\nwas his way of getting error out of the mind and truth in. It does not\r\ndo much good to shoot off a quantity of powder out doors. It will make\r\na big flash and smoke and noise, but what of that; put it in a cannon\r\nbehind a ball and give it aim, and then touch it off, and there will be\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine’s method of getting the light into the people was by getting\r\nthe dark out; like the Dutchman who put a window into his barn to let\r\nthe dark out, but the same process that let the dark out, let the light\r\nin.\r\n\r\nHe had gotten this colloquial style, it may be in congress, or in\r\nYankee land where they “raise questions.” It is a part of a real live\r\nYankee’s life-work to ask questions. This is his birthright, an\r\ninheritance of the soil.\r\n\r\nBut the practice is very prevalent in congress, where there are a great\r\nmany lawyers who are skilled in questioning witnesses, and it is a\r\nhabit with them, carried from their practice in the courts to the halls\r\nof legislation; and it is a very convenient and serviceable habit, as\r\nthe record of proceedings clearly shows.\r\n\r\nIt may be recalled that the campaign of 1864 was prosecuted so\r\neffectually that while McClellan received twenty-one electoral votes,\r\nonly one of the eighteen free states voting thus honored him, namely:\r\nNew Jersey,--Kentucky and Delaware joining with her.\r\n\r\nThe real triumph to Mr. Lincoln was in New York, and we close this\r\nchapter by giving it in Mr. Blaine’s own words, for it had attracted\r\nhis special attention. Horatio Seymour and Reuben E. Fenton were\r\nrespectively the Democratic and Republican candidates for Governor of\r\nNew York:--\r\n\r\n“Governor Seymour’s speech in the Democratic convention at Chicago,\r\nAug. 29, 1864, had been an indictment of the most malignant type\r\nagainst the administration. The president felt that he was himself\r\nwholly wrong, or Governor Seymour was wholly wrong, and the people of\r\nNew York were to decide which. They rendered their verdict in the\r\nelection of Reuben E. Fenton to the governorship by a majority of\r\nthousands over Mr. Seymour. Without that result Mr. Lincoln’s triumph\r\nwould have been incomplete. The victory in the nation,” he adds, “was\r\nthe most complete ever achieved in an election that was seriously\r\ncontested.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\nSECOND TERM IN CONGRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine reached home weary in body, but fresh in spirit, from the\r\ngreat political war in Massachusetts, New York, and Pennsylvania, just\r\nin time to cast his ballot the last time for Abraham Lincoln. He had\r\nstumped his own state from “Kittery to Houlton,” which are the extreme\r\npoints in Maine, and had put in about fifty speeches in the other\r\nstates,--between one and two hundred in all. He had confidence in the\r\nresult, for he had been near the people and got their temper and knew\r\nthe purpose of their sovereign will in the matter, and so it came, but\r\nwith it the reflection that they were only about five years off from\r\nthe Dred Scott decision, and every free state but one voting solid\r\nin the electoral college for the great abolition president, Abraham\r\nLincoln.\r\n\r\nHow dark and infamous, and mysterious, too, looked the repeal of the\r\nMissouri Compromise; the war with Mexico; the Kansas and Nebraska\r\nbill; the proposition to purchase Cuba for purposes of slavery, and\r\nall the political paltroonery and truckling of honored public men, the\r\ntrimmers and time-servers!\r\n\r\nBut what ruin strewed the pathway to such triumph! There was not a\r\nslave in all the land now, according to the proclamation, emphatically\r\nendorsed, and the rebellion well-nigh crushed. The effort had been,\r\nit is thought, for the South to hold out until after the presidential\r\nelection, and hope for the defeat of Mr. Lincoln. The war was over six\r\nmonths after his re-election.\r\n\r\nIn less than a month after election day, Mr. Blaine was in his seat\r\nin congress (December 5th), and there, also, with a knowledge of the\r\nfact that not only had Mr. Lincoln been re-elected president, but he\r\nhimself, also, had been re-elected to congress, for the election took\r\nplace a year before each term expired. How could he be otherwise than\r\nhappy regarding the political outlook of either himself or the nation.\r\nHe need have little thought for himself; he had surely caught at the\r\nflood that tide which leads on to greatness. He was not a coming man,\r\nbut one who had already come. His record of the former session had made\r\nhim more widely known, and known in a larger sense. Indeed, he was\r\nevery way a larger man; beloved at home, respected and admired abroad\r\nin other states, and where his great life-work had so auspiciously\r\nbegun--in congress.\r\n\r\nThe principle of evolution was at work upon him in its only true sense,\r\njust as it operates in tree and flower, where heaven and earth in all\r\ntheir vital forces are made tributary to Nature’s laws of unfolding in\r\nthe deep processes of growth upward to perfection.\r\n\r\nThere had been a wondrous involution from centuries of great history,\r\naccording to subtle, silent laws of hereditary inheritance, in very\r\nblood and life, of tone, and quality, and temper, and now there is\r\nevolved, evoked, just that of power which tells of kinship with those\r\nwho have gone before.\r\n\r\nIt should not cause surprise that Nature keeps her treasures, or that\r\nthe right, the good, the true, live to confront the wrong, the false,\r\nthe bad, with just those elements of a nobler life that no power can\r\nresist.\r\n\r\nThe people everywhere were singing,--\r\n\r\n  “Our God is marching on.”\r\n\r\nAnd so he was, in all of truth and right maintained, in all of good\r\nperformed.\r\n\r\nNever were the good and true remembered in such hosts as when the\r\nnation struggled with her foes. What mighty ones stepped out of the\r\nchaos of a dismal past into splendid life with her! Their name is\r\nlegion; grand in every sphere of greatness, and great in every realm\r\nof grandeur. They thought out the nation first; fought out and forged\r\nit in battle-heat, and hurled it like a thing of life, upon its great\r\ncareer. It never loses its power to go, to be, and conquer, bringing\r\never to the birth, and upward into strong, armed life those whose great\r\nabilities are her own; her own for defense; her own for war, living in\r\ntheir lives, powerful in their strong right arms,--one with them in\r\ndestiny. Among that number now, though reckoned with a multitude, was\r\nJames G. Blaine.\r\n\r\nHe surveyed the field for but a single day after the second session\r\nof his first congress opened,--the thirty-eighth,--and then undid the\r\nmischief of another. It was called the “Gold bill” in the House, and\r\nhad simply been offered and referred to the committee of Ways and\r\nMeans, by a Mr. Stevens, of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nIts substance was, that a dollar note issued by the Government,\r\ndeclared lawful money and legal tender, is declared of equal value for\r\nall purposes as gold and silver coin of like denominations. A contract\r\nmade payable in coin may be payable in legal tender, and anyone should\r\nbe imprisoned who received a greenback for less than gold coin was\r\nworth, and fined as well.\r\n\r\nGold went up in Wall Street within twenty-four hours after the\r\nbill was presented, twelve per cent. Mr. Blaine saw it and moved a\r\nreconsideration of it, sections two, three, five, and six being the\r\nobjectional features of the bill. His speech in support of his motion\r\ndid not occupy ten minutes. The author of the bill, Mr. Stevens, said,--\r\n\r\n“My friend from Maine (Mr. Blaine) has an intuitive way of getting\r\nat a great national question, one that has exercised the thoughts of\r\nstatesmen of several countries for many years.” This in opening; and in\r\nclosing his speech, he said,--\r\n\r\n“How the gentleman from Maine, by his intuitive knowledge of these\r\nthings comes to understand at once what the ablest statesmen of England\r\ntook months to mature, I cannot very well understand. It is a happy\r\ninspiration.”\r\n\r\nHad he a knowledge of his long years of study, that it was then\r\ntwenty-five years since he finished reciting Plutarch, and but little\r\nless than twenty since his graduation, had he a knowledge of the\r\nstrong, determined spirit of mastery which characterized him in all his\r\nwork, could he have read over at that moment the long list of volumes\r\nover which he had poured, had he known these things, he would not\r\nhave felt that a genius of intuition who got at things by inspiration\r\nmerely, sat before him, but one with a genius for the hardest kind\r\nof a student’s work, with intuitions born of high intelligence and\r\ninspiration that comes from conscious strength. No wonder he was an\r\nenigma, a man beyond his years and place, yet master of the situation.\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens’ motion to table the motion of Mr. Blaine, failed,\r\nfifty-one to sixty-eight, and then the motion of Mr. Blaine regarding\r\nthe bill of Mr. Stevens, carried, seventy-three to fifty-two. It is\r\ninteresting to notice, that though the gentleman did not call up his\r\nbill for a solid month,--not until after the holidays,--and then came\r\nin with an elaborate argument showing the financial course of England\r\nin her war with France in 1793, and then in her war finally with the\r\nwhole of continental Europe, though he seemed to have made a careful\r\nstudy of his subject, and of England’s financial policy, he closed with\r\nthis sentence:--\r\n\r\n“I feel that England never had so absurd a law as to pay one part of\r\nher war-debt in gold and another part in Bank of England notes.” He\r\nsaid “I feel,” he did not know. But Mr. Blaine knew, and so he asked\r\nhim whether the bonds negotiated by England upon the continent were not\r\npayable in gold.\r\n\r\n“I do not know,” was the answer.\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Blaine stated, “Every one of them negotiated upon the\r\ncontinent was payable in gold, both principal and interest. Every one\r\nnegotiated at the Hague, at Frankfort-on-the-Main, and elsewhere upon\r\nthe continent, was negotiated upon the gold basis exclusively.”\r\n\r\nThis was no contest to win, but simply to bring out financial\r\nintelligence in a semi-official way, for the benefit of the country.\r\nIt was a most sensitive subject. Gold was up to two hundred and fifty,\r\nthat is, a hundred dollars in gold cost two hundred and fifty dollars\r\nin greenbacks, and Mr. Stevens had endeavored in a wrong way, as Mr.\r\nBrooks showed, to correct gambling in gold, but Mr. Blaine could\r\nfurnish him with deficiencies of knowledge, and manifest the acumen of\r\na statesman upon a subject so great.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine had his magnetic power then, and Mr. Stevens refers to it,\r\nand his great power over the House in securing so promptly the passage\r\nof his motion. He said,\r\n\r\n“The House, partaking of the magnetic manner of my friend from Maine,\r\nbecame alarmed, and immediately laid the bill on the table.”\r\n\r\nIt was his power of quick, thrilling action; of feeling strongly, and\r\nmaking others feel as he did; of casting upon them the glow of his own\r\nbrilliancy; of charming them with the rhapsody of his own genius; of\r\npiercing them with the energy of his own thinking, and so shutting them\r\nup to his conclusions by the force of his own arguments; it was thus\r\nby methods the fairest and most honorable to his abilities, that he\r\ncarried all before him. And one can but see in his repeated control of\r\nthe House, the power of his friendships.\r\n\r\nCox, Pendleton, Brooks, and others of the opposition would show him the\r\ngreatest courtesies in debate. Randall, even, in his first session,\r\ngave him time out of his own hour for an entire speech, and Cox\r\nencouraged him in the midst of his Gold bill speech, by saying he was\r\nwith him on it.\r\n\r\nWhen the Naval Academy bill was before the House, he moved to repeal\r\na section relating to cadets “found deficient.” If they had a hundred\r\ndemerit marks in six months they would be expelled. Mr. Blaine had\r\nvisited the academy in 1861, as a member of the “Board of Visitors,”\r\nand while there a young man was dismissed, not for any fault of\r\nscholarship, for he was among the brightest and best in his class.\r\n\r\nBecoming deeply interested in the cause of the young man, he went to\r\nWashington and successfully interceded with the secretary of war, and\r\nhe was restored. He subsequently graduated very high in class-rank,\r\nand since his entrance upon active service has distinguished himself\r\nas an officer of great merit, serving with efficiency and distinction\r\nas ordnance-officer on General Sheridan’s staff in that splendid,\r\nvictorious campaign in the valley of the Shenandoah.\r\n\r\nThe demerits were given for singularly small offences, as: “floor out\r\nof order near wash-stand, four demerits,” etc., etc.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine insisted that to the secretary of war and the president be\r\nrestored the power that was taken from them at the last session,--to\r\npardon any cadet discharged for any of these offences.\r\n\r\nGeneral Schenck joined him, and the amendment was adopted.\r\n\r\nThere is a little section of his speech on the Military Academy bill\r\nwhich shows his admiration for the telling power of manhood, and his\r\nutter scorn of sacrificing great ability, for which the nation was so\r\nloudly calling then, to little, simple things, good in themselves, but\r\nnot of first importance, that we cannot forbear to give it. Here it is,\r\nverbatim, as he delivered it in congress:--\r\n\r\n“Many of the cadets, sir, who have been very precise and decorous in\r\ntheir conduct in matters of petty discipline at the academy, and manage\r\nto pass through smoothly, often graduating with high rank obtained\r\nby very strict attention to ‘folding beds by 10 A. M.,’ and ‘drawing\r\ncurtains by at precisely 6.45 A. M.’ (academy rules), are unfortunately\r\nnever heard from afterwards. Their names do not always figure in the\r\nrecord of our bloody battles, and they have achieved no distinction\r\nin this war, with all its thousand opportunities, while on the other\r\nhand not a few of the graduates at the academy who at the Point had\r\nthe ‘odor of tobacco in their rooms,’ and whose ‘floors were out of\r\norder near the wash-stand,’ have blazoned their names high on the roll\r\nof fame for conduct as gallant and skill as great as ever graced the\r\nbattle-fields of any age country.”\r\n\r\nEfficiency has ever been the test with him in his own work, and this\r\nhe applies to others; as one has said, “We measure others in our own\r\nhalf-bushel; of course we do, we have no other.”\r\n\r\nEarly in the session he had a running debate which tried his metal,\r\nwith Thayer, of Pennsylvania; Justin S. Morrill, of Vermont; James\r\nS. Wilson, of Iowa; General Schenck, of Ohio, and S. S. Cox, of Ohio\r\nyielding the floor for the purpose.\r\n\r\nIt was not only a proof of his knowledge, but also of his ability to\r\nuse it on demand, and he showed himself equal to the exigency, and\r\nshowed that he was generally found away on the lead in his discussion\r\nof constitutional measures and application of principles.\r\n\r\nIt is possible for a man to go over, in a long-winded speech, a vast\r\namount of ground, which has been tramped as bare as the camp-ground of\r\na brigade of soldiers, by a multitude of debaters; ground which has\r\nbeen surveyed, and staked out, and pre-empted, and owned for a century\r\nor more, and concerning which, as concerning the constitution there is\r\nno question. Such speeches as these wearied the progressive spirit of\r\nadvanced ones, and made them restless when the fate of great interests\r\nhung on the decision of a few hours’ discussion. No one watched more\r\nclosely the utterances of men upon the floor, or held them to a\r\nstricter account.\r\n\r\nIn presenting a minority report on amendment of rules for the\r\ngovernment of the House, Mr. Morrill had placed some undue restriction\r\nupon the powers of congress, and courteously waiting until he had\r\nfinished a long speech of ten or eleven columns, Mr. Blaine asked him\r\nwhether the power of impeachment would not extend to cabinet officers,\r\nand so their attendance upon the sittings of the House be compelled, a\r\npoint Mr. Morrill had denied.\r\n\r\nThere had been little demand for this power slumbering in the\r\nconstitution,--power which was used upon a president shortly\r\nafterward,--but brought prominently to the attention of the House,\r\nand much light thrown on it by the answers tersely given to near a\r\nscore of questions, members were pleased to ask Mr. Blaine, and while\r\nhe was ready with abundant answers; clear and strong, and packed with\r\nknowledge of the highest legal type, he was ready as well if there was\r\nhint of an assailant in manner or tone, to thrust out a sharp, rising\r\nquestion which would almost take the breath of the man who might be\r\nafter him. When General Schenck asked him if the secretary of war was\r\na civil officer, his quick reply was, “I do not think that a ‘civil’\r\nquestion.” Neither was it, for as member of the cabinet of course he\r\nwas a civil officer, as much so as the president himself, who was by\r\nvirtue of his office “Commander-in-chief of the armies of the Union.”\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Blaine had great respect for age and learning, and allowed no\r\nopportunity to show it to pass by unimproved. His early intercourse\r\nwith his Grandfather Gillespie had developed largely veneration both\r\nfor gray hairs and scholarly attainments, a veneration which had\r\nmatured by associations with his teachers and great men of the nation\r\nwhom he had met in his youthful days, and those whom he had since come\r\nto know and honor.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Henry Winter Davis came on with his great naval speech,\r\nMr. Blaine heard him with special pleasure, and had some very\r\ncomplimentary things to say of “the caustic, scathing, truthful, and\r\ndeserved criticism of the naval department in building,” as Mr. Blaine\r\nsaid, “twenty iron-clad vessels, at a cost of ten millions of dollars,\r\nthat will not stay on top of water.”\r\n\r\nMr. Pike had just taken him to task for this last statement, when\r\nthe “hammer fell,” and Mr. Davis, showing his appreciation of the\r\ncourtesies of Mr. Blaine, arose and said, “I ask unanimous consent that\r\nthe gentleman from Maine may be permitted to proceed.” This was indeed\r\na consideration which young members seldom received from the veterans\r\nof the House, and especially from one with a national reputation for\r\nscholarly attainments. But as “the debate in Committee of the Whole\r\nwas closed by order of the House,” the Chair could not grant the\r\nrequest, and just here Mr. Blaine’s shrewdness and intimate knowledge\r\nof parliamentary rules showed itself. “I move,” he said, “to amend the\r\namendment, by striking out the first line; that will entitle me to the\r\nfloor for a few minutes longer.”\r\n\r\nThen he went on to give an official fact, as he called it, and he knew\r\nwell the value of such things; there was nothing “fine-spun” about\r\nthem, but strong and stubborn, and full of power to convince. “Out of\r\nninety British steamers,” he said, “caught within a given period in\r\nattempting to run the blockade, only twelve were caught by vessels\r\nbuilt by the present administration of the navy department; while\r\nseventy-eight were caught either by purchased vessels, or vessels\r\ninherited from the old navy. I submit, sir, that this fact bears with\r\ncrushing force on the practical question of the speed and efficiency of\r\nvessels of the new navy.” It is bad enough to swindle the government at\r\nany time, and in any thing, but in times of war to swindle her in the\r\nconstruction of iron-clad vessels that will not float, yet needed at\r\nonce for active service, and produce twenty of them at half a million\r\ndollars apiece, was enough to arouse the indignation not only of the\r\nolder member, Mr. Davis, but also of the younger man, Mr. Blaine.\r\n\r\nAnd this now gave him a new, fresh start, untrammeled by crutch or\r\ncane, casting him wholly upon his own resources, and placing him where\r\nhe must put forth all the power in him, or utterly fail.\r\n\r\n“When the Jeannette went down, crushed and sunken by the ice,” writes\r\nLieutenant Danenhouser, “we started with our boats southward, dragging\r\nthem over the ice, broken and piled in every conceivable shape. We\r\naccomplished seven miles the first week, only to find, by taking\r\nobservations, that the ice-floe had drifted us back to the northward\r\ntwenty-seven miles, and so placing us twenty miles to the rear of the\r\nspot where we had started, and our ship had sunk.” They had intrepid\r\nspirits, but no firm ground; he had both the intrepid spirit and the\r\nfirm ground on which to stand, and his victory was swift and certain.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine never lost an opportunity to do a favor, or make a friend.\r\nDoing duty was his delight; getting hold of strong, plain, practical\r\nfacts, and presenting them in a way that showed a constant, abiding\r\ninterest in his constituency, that he was living and toiling for them,\r\nand had their best interest, and those of the entire state of Maine,\r\nand the whole country at heart.\r\n\r\nHere is one of his plain, practical statements, showing his loyalty to\r\nhome interests, as well as the business interests of the country. A\r\nvessel from his district had been chartered to government to carry a\r\ncargo of four hundred and fifty tons of coal from Philadelphia to New\r\nOrleans, for six thousand dollars. Upon her return her disbursements\r\nhad been six thousand, two hundred and thirty-eight dollars and\r\nfive cents. She received six thousand dollars in certificates of\r\nindebtedness from the government, then selling them at ninety-four,\r\nwhich made but five thousand six hundred and forty dollars in cash,\r\nshowing a net cash loss of five hundred and ninety-eight dollars and\r\nfive cents, besides the interest on advance, about two hundred dollars\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n“And now, sir,” said Mr. Blaine, “after this melancholy experience the\r\ntax-collector came forward and demanded of the owner of the vessel, two\r\nand one-half per cent. on the six thousand dollars which the government\r\npaid, as above, and on top of all losses already incurred actually\r\ncompelled him to pay one hundred and fifty dollars under that section\r\nof the internal-revenue law, which we are seeking to amend.\r\n\r\n“A man’s profit in business,” he goes on to say, “affords a fair basis\r\nof taxation, but it is a cruel mockery of one’s misfortune to assess a\r\ntax upon losses.”\r\n\r\nHe further plead that “as commercial men of the country, who do so much\r\nto sustain our finances and our honor, they should be relieved from its\r\noppressive exactions.”\r\n\r\nThere were no mists or fogs about him to conceal him or his methods,\r\nand what he said stood out in the clear light of day. In this case he\r\nwas able to catch up from memory, a better argument for the repeal\r\nof the oppressive section of the law than had come to the House in\r\na lengthy written memorial from a company doing business on the\r\nSchuylkill Canal in Pennsylvania, and who could make sitings net them\r\nfour hundred and ten dollars, while in the case cited by Mr. Blaine,\r\none trip was made at a loss of nine hundred and forty-eight dollars and\r\nfive cents.\r\n\r\nSeldom did he cite his own opinion. It was the bludgeon of hard, solid\r\nfacts with which he did his best execution. Others might theorize,\r\nand imagine, and conceive, and spin web after web of sophistry, like\r\nthe spider, out of themselves, to be full as flimsy when the storm\r\nof debate beat upon it, but not he. He evidently kept up a living\r\nacquaintance with those to whom he was responsible, and this, with\r\nan ever vigilant correspondence, enabled him to know, and not simply\r\nthink and feel, but actually to know their adverse experiences where\r\nthe operations of the machinery of government affected them, and with\r\nreasonable and apparent facts in hand he could easily procure the\r\nremedy. This lively interest, so practical and so potent as well, was\r\nwith him a constant element of power.\r\n\r\nHe lost no opportunity to familiarize himself with business\r\nenterprises, great and small, and get the best authority on all\r\nquestions of finance and trade, and as a result he could speak with\r\npertinency, and from a mind prolific of the freshest data on the\r\npractical questions as they were constantly coming before the House,\r\nand especially in the old war-days, when the vexed questions of\r\ninternal revenue, with all its myriad details regarding the nature and\r\nvalue of taxable articles, were being adjusted.\r\n\r\nAt one time when he first entered congress, nearly every article that\r\nentered into the construction of a ship was taxed, and then upon her\r\ntonnage, and then, beside, upon the gross receipts for carrying the\r\ncargo. He saw to it at once that those matters were attended to.\r\n\r\nBut a fresh call was out for troops, and it was a final call. They\r\nwere getting ready for the great opening of the spring campaign which\r\nwas to speedily end in crushing the Rebellion, and annihilating the\r\nConfederacy. There was a flaw in the enrollment law passed the last\r\nsession, which Mr. Blaine had discovered, and sought to remedy. It\r\npermitted recruiting in the rebel states, and credits for previous\r\nnaval enlistments. “From these two sources have arisen the gigantic and\r\nwide-spread evil of filling quotas of towns without adding troops to\r\nthe army.” He had offered an amendment which was designed to bring back\r\nrecruiting to “an honest, meritorious, and patriotic effort to fill the\r\nranks of our gallant army with men, and not with shadowy fictions which\r\npass under the name of ‘paper credits.’” The quotas of entire cities,\r\ndistricts, and possibly states, had been thus filled “without adding a\r\nsingle man or musket to the effective military force of the nation.\r\nThere was fraud, and he would so change the law that it could not be\r\nperpetuated.”\r\n\r\nThere were substitute-brokers, who, in some mysterious way, would get\r\nhold of these “credits,” as they were called, and sell them, much as\r\ntorn scrip is sold.\r\n\r\n“We can deal just by the government,” he said, “in its struggle for\r\nexistence. It calls for men, and it is worse than madness to answer\r\nthis call with anything else than men.\r\n\r\n“In conclusion,” and his words reveal a genuine patriotism and zeal of\r\naffection for the soldier, “nothing so discourages the brave men at the\r\nfront as the belief that proper measures are not adopted at home for\r\nre-enforcing and sustaining them.\r\n\r\n“After four years of such patriotic and heroic effort for national\r\nunity as the world has never witnessed before, we cannot now afford\r\nto have the great cause injured, or its fair fame darkened by a\r\nsingle unworthy incident connected with it. The improper practices of\r\nindividuals cannot disgrace and degrade the nation, but after these\r\npractices are brought to the attention of congress, we shall assuredly\r\nbe disgraced and degraded if we fail to apply the remedy. Let us, then,\r\nin this hour of the national need, do our duty here, our duty to the\r\ntroops in the field, our duty to our constituents at home, and our\r\ncountry; above all, to our country, whose existence has been in such\r\nperil in the past, but whose future of greatness and glory seems now so\r\nassured, and so radiant.”\r\n\r\nFew utterances of those long, dark years, breathed a spirit of more\r\ndevoted loyalty than is found even in these few sentences, and they\r\nwere uttered when they would do the most good, and secure just those\r\nre-enforcements that would gladden the hearts of veterans, and hasten\r\nthe end of the struggle.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine had a keen eye for fraud, and made it his business to detect\r\nit; and he was just fearless enough to hold it up to the light of day.\r\nWherever he unearthed it he would point out the individual, and point\r\nhis finger at him and say, with a boldness known only to invective and\r\nscorn, “Thou art the man!”\r\n\r\nHe never seemed to take care of his popularity, but of his constituents\r\nand of his country. Enemies abounded, and evil, and wrong; and to these\r\nhe paid effective attention, rightly judging that no course is safer,\r\nor accords with fuller satisfaction, than the right course. With him,\r\ncharacter was the citadel of strength and influence; and so we find\r\nhim knowing and trusting himself, reaching for wrong in all of its\r\nstrongholds.\r\n\r\nAnd there was much to encourage now Sherman had reached the sea;\r\nColumbia, S. C., was captured; Charleston was evacuated; the old flag\r\nwas again flying over Fort Sumter, and Washington’s Birthday was to\r\nbe celebrated, by order of the secretary of war, E. M. Stanton, by\r\na “national salute at West Point, and at every fort, arsenal, and\r\narmy head-quarters of the United States, in honor of the event.” This\r\ntwenty-second day of February was a long, busy day in congress. It\r\nwas a quarter past five before the House adjourned. Mr. Blaine was in\r\nhis seat all day long, voting steadily for the right and against the\r\nwrong. The conquered states, cut off from the Rebellion and rescued to\r\nliberty and lawful authority, were left without government, and must\r\nbe provided, as Tennessee had been in the person of Andrew Johnson,\r\nnow vice-president, with provisional governors. Much legislation was\r\nrequisite. Every man in congress who had ever had any pro-slavery\r\nproclivities, was in his place contesting every step of progress with\r\nmen who had never breathed aught but the air of freedom and known only\r\nloyal heart-beats.\r\n\r\nOne bill granted citizenship to all colored men who had served in the\r\narmy and navy.\r\n\r\nRight royal work, this, for such a man to be doing on a day so sacred;\r\nhelping into citizenship the colored man, ever loyal, ever true.\r\n\r\nThis seemed to be the great feature of all the great bills before the\r\nHouse that day. It came up in the bill to encourage enlistments, and\r\nthe worth and dignity of being an American citizen was held up before\r\nthe negro as a prize for him to win; as something in store for him in\r\nthe future; and so as giving to the colored troops, and all who united\r\nwith them, this personal interest in relation to the government. But\r\nit takes time to get such thoughts adjusted to minds struggling with\r\nthe fact of Emancipation, and so little is done but give the bills a\r\nhearing and pass them to another reading. Coming events had cast their\r\nshadows before them. It was, however, but the shadow of a passing\r\ncloud, and told of a great, bright sun shining in the heavens yonder,\r\nwhich would soon dissipate all clouds and shadows, and the long night\r\nof bondage ended, give a glorious day, in which the world might see\r\nin the poorest black man of the South an American citizen, possessed\r\nof certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the\r\npursuit of happiness.\r\n\r\nTo the happy consummation of a task so grand, whose inspiration comes\r\nfrom that free and holy place where “all are one,” Mr. Blaine had set\r\nhis hand, only to remove it when the chaplet of America’s proudest,\r\nnoblest glory was on the black man’s brow.\r\n\r\nThat life is most divine which is most in line with Providence, and has\r\nthe most of uplifting power in it, which stands the highest up, and\r\ncan reach the farthest down, is many-handed in its helpfulness, and\r\nstrong-handed as well, to unshackle humanity in body, in soul, and in\r\nspirit, and tell the fallen or sunken ones how to get upward toward God\r\nand heaven.\r\n\r\nOpening the gates of heaven means unlocking the gates of earth, and to\r\nthis latter task the statesmen of the nation stood pledged from that\r\nday, since numbered among the nation’s holidays. A close student of\r\nMr. Blaine’s congressional career will be impressed with the fact that\r\nit seems planned and determined before-hand. There are no surprises in\r\nit. He seems to have determined upon his course before entering it, and\r\ngives his strength to certain measures, and does not fritter it away\r\nupon every resolve, or amendment, or motion, that happens to be before\r\nthe House, affecting some far away interest of a day-dreamer.\r\n\r\nHe recognizes the fact fully that he is one of a great body of men,\r\neach one of whom is charged with interests of an important character\r\nto their state or district, and many heavily weighted with special\r\nand peculiar measures of national importance. These must all have\r\ntheir opportunity. Less than ninety working-days usually comprise the\r\nsession, and there are but four of these in a congress,--from March to\r\nadjournment, and from December to March, and then repeated, constitutes\r\na congressional term, with eight of them in a presidential term, or\r\ntwo a year for the four years. Beside, it takes so long a time to get\r\nmeasures through congress that the successful man finds it necessary to\r\ndevote himself with great carefulness to the few measures of importance\r\nhe would have adopted, and become law organic or otherwise.\r\n\r\nVery soon after Mr. Blaine entered congress he presented a resolution\r\ninstructing the Committee on Judiciary to inquire into the expediency\r\nof amending the constitution so as to allow congress to levy an export\r\ntax. But the session closed, and it is not reported, and now his second\r\nsession is closing, and still it is not forthcoming. Why not? He will\r\nknow the reason why! And so there comes a day near the session’s close,\r\nonly the day before Mr. Lincoln’s second inauguration, when he arises\r\nand states “a little grievance.” He states the resolution, its being\r\noffered at the last session, and now again at the present session.\r\nIt had been to the Ways and Means Committee, to which it had been\r\ntransferred. Evidently he had been ready to grapple with the subject\r\nfor some time, and proceeded to do so. It involved an amendment to\r\nthe constitution, and one “essential to the financial success of the\r\ngovernment, and to the agricultural, commercial, and manufacturing\r\nprosperity of the country in all future time.”\r\n\r\nIt was stated that the measure would have been presented by the\r\ncommittee, if they had supposed time would have permitted of its\r\nconsideration. It presented a subject that was discussed at length in\r\nthe Convention of 1787. The “Madison Papers” give a synopsis of the\r\nconstitutional debates of that convention, and show that many of the\r\nstrongest men of that body, the really far-sighted ones, opposed the\r\ninsertion of the clause prohibiting a tax on exports. The vote was not\r\na very decisive one, nor did its advocacy come from the Southern or\r\n“staple states,” and opposition from Northern states.\r\n\r\nHe proceeds to deliver what is his great speech, if not the great\r\nspeech of the session. It was probably not over an hour long, but he\r\nhad not proceeded far before it became apparent that he had thoroughly\r\nstudied the subject, and was investing it with a new interest.\r\n\r\nA great debt of more than two billion eight hundred million was on the\r\nnation. Mr. Blaine’s amendment was looking towards its liquidation.\r\nIt was the wise, strong look far ahead. He saw in it several hundred\r\nmillions of revenue in the export of cotton, tobacco, and naval stores,\r\nwithout affecting the demand for them, and also in petroleum, and\r\nnumberless articles, still more of revenue. France was taxing her wines\r\nand brandies, and countries having peculiar commodities taxed them.\r\n\r\nCotton which sold in Liverpool at eleven and three-quarters pence per\r\npound in December, 1861, sold for twenty-four and one-half pence per\r\npound in just one year from that date. The three million two hundred\r\nthousand bales of five hundred pounds each, this country had exported,\r\nwere missed there.\r\n\r\n“Whoever as secretary of the treasury shall undertake and succeed in\r\npaying the debt,” he argues in closing, “must have open to him the\r\nthree great avenues of taxation, namely, the tariff, the excise system,\r\nand the duties on exports, and must be empowered to use each in its\r\nappropriate place, by congressional legislation.”\r\n\r\nAnd so he closed the first half of his second congressional year, with\r\nthe same policy of questions with which he began, aiming still at\r\nthoroughness and mastery, still the guiding stars of his history, the\r\nmoulding powers and the prominent features of his great career.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\nCONTINUED WORK IN CONGRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is Inauguration Day in Washington. Not McClellan,--he is in\r\nEurope,--but Lincoln is to be inaugurated. It is a day of wondrous\r\nglory to him, and to the nation, but one so oppressed with the cares of\r\nstate has but little joy in it. There is no retiring president to sign\r\nall the tardy bills of an expiring congress. He must do it all, and\r\nthen go from the realizations of the past to the unknown of the new.\r\nThere was no instant of rest for him between laying off the armor and\r\nputting it on anew.\r\n\r\nOf all the many thousand eyes that looked on him that day, none were\r\nmore brilliant with the look of praise, none gleamed with a soul-light\r\nmore fervent, none took in the scene with deeper thoughts of the hour\r\nor the future, oppressive with interest, than Mr. Blaine.\r\n\r\nLittle did he dream of twenty years to come. He had thought to scale\r\nthe centuries as they stood like silent statues in the sombre, shadowy\r\npast, and read out the hieroglyphics of their history. But just as the\r\nrebellion was broken, shattered, staggering to its fall, and seemed\r\ncertain, and was scarce hung about with doubt, so now to faith the\r\nfuture is bright and clear, while hope is strong and almost gay with\r\nvivid anticipations.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine was profoundly impressed with the religious character of\r\nAbraham Lincoln, as exemplified in the tone of his public documents.\r\n\r\nHe says: “Throughout the whole period of the war he constantly directed\r\nthe attention of the nation to dependence on God. It may indeed be\r\ndoubted whether he omitted this in a single state paper. In every\r\nmessage to congress, in every proclamation to the people, he made it\r\nprominent. In July, 1863, after the battle of Gettysburgh, he called\r\nupon the people to give thanks because ‘it has pleased Almighty God to\r\nhearken to the supplications and prayers of an afflicted people, and to\r\nvouchsafe signal and effective victories to the army and navy of the\r\nUnited States,’ and he asked the people ‘to render homage to the Divine\r\nMajesty and to invoke the influence of His Holy Spirit to subdue the\r\nanger which has produced and so long sustained a needless and cruel\r\nrebellion.’”\r\n\r\n“On another occasion,” writes Mr. Blaine, “recounting the blessings\r\nwhich had come to the Union, he said: ‘No human counsel hath devised,\r\nnor hath any mortal hand worked out these great things. They are the\r\ngracious gifts of the Most High God, who, while dealing with us in\r\nanger for our sins, hath nevertheless remembered mercy.’ Throughout his\r\nentire official career, attended at all times with exacting duty and\r\npainful responsibility, he never forgot his own dependence unto the\r\nsame authority, or the dependence of the people upon a Higher Power.”\r\nAnd then he quotes those words of the great man, uttered reverently\r\nto the people assembled in crowds to congratulate him upon the return\r\nof peace: “In the midst of your joyous expressions, He from whom all\r\nblessings flow must first be remembered.”\r\n\r\nHis last inaugural, delivered but a little while before this final\r\nutterance, was in keeping with it. It was a deeply religious document,\r\nreferring to no political measure or material interest, and in six days\r\nafter the people crowd about him, full of joy at the close of the war,\r\nthe bullet of the assassin is in his brain! What a week was that in\r\nwhich the war closed, and the great Lincoln was murdered! And what a\r\nsummer was that, when the broken armies came marching home, halting in\r\nWashington for the great review!\r\n\r\nBut a campaign is on Mr. Blaine, and he hurries home. For the third\r\ntime Samuel Coney is elected governor, and Mr. Blaine has again done\r\nhis work well. Autumn passes, and he is in his place at the opening of\r\nthe thirty-ninth congress. With his usual unforgetfulness, he resumes\r\nconnection with a bill presented by him in the early part of the\r\nprevious congress, for reimbursing the loyal states for war-expenses in\r\nresponse to the president’s call for troops. His bill is very explicit,\r\nand shows that during the long delay he had perfected it in its\r\ndetails. No flaw is found in it, no amendment is made to it, but it is\r\nat once referred, upon his motion, to a select committee of seven, and\r\nupon his motion he demands the previous question, so that the matter\r\nshall be attended to at once. The bill was read a first and second\r\ntime, and so referred.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine is of course upon the committee, and by his motion members\r\nare added to it, and they are empowered to hire a clerk. What a work\r\nto examine and pass upon all the war-debts of the loyal states! A\r\ngrave question soon makes its appearance in congress. In undoing the\r\nlegislation of years, enacted in the interests of slavery, they have\r\ncome to the basis of representation. The slave is not yet a citizen,\r\nand if the basis is population and not suffrage, the South will have an\r\nimmense advantage,--indeed an advantage similar to that enjoyed before\r\nthe war, when, though slaves were expressly recognized as chattels,\r\nand according to the Dred Scott decision, “a black man had no rights a\r\nwhite man was bound to respect,” yet, according to slavery law five of\r\nthem gave their master three extra votes.\r\n\r\nBut the ratio of voters to population varied from nineteen to\r\nfifty-eight per cent. in different states, as, for example, California\r\nhad two hundred and seven thousand voters out of a population of three\r\nhundred and fifty-eight thousand one hundred and ten, while Vermont had\r\nbut eighty-seven thousand voters out of a population of three hundred\r\nand fourteen thousand three hundred and sixty-nine, and each had three\r\nrepresentatives in congress; that is, eighty-seven thousand voters in\r\nVermont sent three congressmen, while two hundred and seven thousand\r\nvoters in California sent but the same number.\r\n\r\nThere were more women and children in Vermont, two to one, than in\r\nCalifornia, and so in the latter state there were more than twice as\r\nmany voters in the same population.\r\n\r\nIt was with such arguments as the above,--a mathematical argument,\r\nwithout sophistry, and that cannot be impeached,--that he opposed a\r\nconstitutional amendment making suffrage and not population the basis\r\nof representation, and so reserving an argument to use in framing the\r\ncitizenship of the freemen.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine has long been noted for the great rapidity with which he\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nHe very soon has an immense report from his committee of nine, to\r\npay the loyal states their war-claims. In it twenty-six states, five\r\nterritories, and the District of Columbia have their war-claims\r\nadjusted, and they are to receive all the way from nine thousand nine\r\nhundred and fifty-five dollars, as in the case of the territory of\r\nDakota for enlisting one hundred and eighty-one men, up to twenty\r\nmillion nine hundred and ninety-three thousand two hundred and eighty\r\ndollars, as in the case of New York for enlisting three hundred and\r\neighty-one thousand six hundred and ninety-six men; and it is a\r\npeculiarity with him to know for himself, by careful computation, the\r\nexact truth of the statistics he employs.\r\n\r\nOne day it so happened that he used the calculations of a distinguished\r\nmember who was chairman of a prominent committee,--that of ways and\r\nmeans,--and they were called in question; but soon after he was able to\r\naffirm publicly that they were correct.\r\n\r\nThere was such a charm in being right and knowing it, despite all\r\ncontradiction, that he could not forego the pleasure, the very\r\nconfidence and self-respect, even at the expense of perplexing effort.\r\nA point of order was raised against him one day; his instant reply was,\r\n“That point was raised exactly ten years ago and overruled,” and the\r\nchair ruled in harmony with his remembrance.\r\n\r\nHis great love for mathematics, and the position he was in requiring\r\nit, he was led to make an extensive study of the history of finance,\r\nand in a speech of great length, by which he supported his report to\r\npay the vast war-claims of the loyal states, he clearly shows the wide\r\nrange of his acquaintance with the subject. He shows great familiarity\r\nwith the policy and utterances of Alexander Hamilton, his exceeding\r\ncommon-sense methods, which he quotes with so great aptness as to give\r\nthem the power of living arguments, as he offers them in evidence of\r\nthe wisdom of his own views and the tenable nature of the positions he\r\nhas taken.\r\n\r\nIt was proposed to bring all troops to a three years’ basis, and then\r\nrefund at the rate of fifty-five dollars a man. Thus, Pennsylvania,\r\nwith three hundred and sixty-six thousand three hundred and twenty-six\r\nmen, which, reduced to a three years’ basis, gave two hundred and\r\nsixty-seven thousand five hundred and fifty-eight, which at the rate\r\nproposed made the claim of that state fourteen million seven hundred\r\nand fifteen thousand six hundred and ninety dollars. The Gettysburgh\r\nbattle alone had cost the state seven hundred thousand dollars, and as\r\nfor that and other service she had furnished men for a much shorter\r\nperiod than three years, the whole number of men were reduced nearly\r\none hundred thousand to get them all on the three years’ basis.\r\n\r\nNo question commanded a more wide-spread or deeper attention for years\r\nsubsequent to the war than the question of money, and it behooved any\r\nman with the aspirations of a statesman, to make a long and thorough\r\nstudy of it.\r\n\r\n“Reading,” it is said, “makes a full man, speaking a ready man.” He was\r\nboth reader and speaker, and so proved the truth of the maxim, by being\r\nboth a full and a ready man; and he never allowed himself to get empty.\r\nIt was the knowledge of the day, most valuable to him, with which he\r\nwas filled, as well as that which came from historical research.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that, as a member of the committee on military\r\naffairs, and while the conduct of the office of provost-marshal\r\ngeneral was being investigated, that he had his lively tilt with Mr.\r\nRoscoe Conkling, and brought out all of his powers of wit and sarcasm,\r\nshowing him more than a match for the gentleman. It was undoubtedly\r\nthe most brilliant intellectual contest of the session. Ex-Governor\r\nMorrill says, “It was a pretty lively time, but they were boys then,\r\nand probably are better friends to-day, though it is certainly evident\r\nthey both did their best.”\r\n\r\nConsistency in legislation seemed a law with Mr. Blaine, so that\r\nthe House should not be found contradicting itself on the military\r\nfunctions of the president. Indeed the powers of government are so\r\nnicely balanced between the executive and the Senate and House,\r\nthat great watchfulness is needed that there be no conflict; and\r\nnew members,--and sometimes old members,--are found transgressing\r\nlegitimate bounds. For instance, there was a section to a bill that\r\n“until the fourth day of July, in the year 1870, all persons who\r\nvoluntarily adhered to the late insurrection, giving it aid and\r\ncomfort, shall be excluded from the right to vote for representatives\r\nin congress, and for elections for president and vice-president of the\r\nUnited States.” He at once raised the question of bad faith, because on\r\nJuly 17, 1862, they had authorized the president to grant pardon and\r\namnesty to any person, state or part thereof, that was in rebellion.\r\n\r\nAnd to this effect President Lincoln did issue a proclamation, and\r\nhundreds, and perhaps thousands of pardons were granted. And in 1865\r\nPresident Johnson issued his celebrated amnesty proclamation, pardoning\r\nall below the military rank of colonel, who had participated in the\r\nRebellion, excepting certain classes.\r\n\r\nOne thing is clearly manifest in all of Mr. Blaine’s operations in\r\ncongress,--he thoroughly enjoys it all; he is at home, and feels so\r\nconstantly. He can trust himself; there is no striving for effect. He\r\nnever gets lost in depths, nor aground upon shallows. He can fish in\r\ndeep water, or seine near shore. It is quite noticeable how he will go\r\nwith the passage of a motion from some minor detail of internal revenue\r\nto the gravest questions of constitutional law. It was said once by\r\na great preacher who was pastor of a large church, editor of a large\r\npaper, and engaged in writing a book, that he had to live in those\r\nthree great spheres, transporting himself daily from one to another,\r\nas he worked in each. But here were not less than a dozen great\r\ndepartments with which one must be as familiar as with the rooms of his\r\ndwelling, and have in possession, living, present, trenchant facts;\r\nthe latest phases of new, fresh life, and the old and musty as well.\r\nFor it will not do to blunder in congress; it is blundering before the\r\nnation, and before the world. The folks at home will find it out right\r\noff, and worst of all _you_ will find it out, and a man will feel so\r\nterribly small, and ashamed, and mean, and it will be such desperate\r\nhard work to own up, and sit down with all-hands looking straight at\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the first matters of congressional courtesy, to let anyone\r\nask you a question. And this is all done so blandly, and in such\r\nelegant diction, one is almost charmed by the tones so as scarcely to\r\nget hold of the question itself; but that question is like the bee, so\r\nbright and beautiful, and musical withal, and yet it has a sting.\r\n\r\nWhat is denominated “brass,” in modern parlance, will not serve one’s\r\npurpose. It is at once detected by its sound, and then confusion\r\ncomes,--it will come, it must come, and brass cannot prevent it.\r\n\r\nThe present was a long, tedious term, and kept the members well into\r\nthe summer. The internal-revenue laws must be properly adjusted; the\r\narmy re-organized; settlers were pouring, by the thousand, and actually\r\nby the hundred thousand, into the great region between the Missouri and\r\nthe Pacific,--so much so that the lieutenant-general urges congress to\r\nprovide the means requisite for their protection, as a great body of\r\ncitizens who are filling up the country, rendering it productive, and\r\nerecting states; and beside these, a multitude of other things are\r\ndemanding attention.\r\n\r\nAnd then, after adjournment, comes the great campaign, in which the\r\nthirteenth amendment is submitted to the suffrage of the people.\r\nTwo-thirds of the states must endorse it to make it organic law, and\r\nthis they do right heartily, and congress resumes its session the\r\nfirst Monday in December. It is the second session of the thirty-ninth\r\ncongress, and the second of Mr. Blaine’s second term.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine had a very eligible seat, at the left of the speaker, and\r\nwell in front; almost within reach of him sat Garfield.\r\n\r\nThe first day of the session Mr. Blaine made a move for the repeal of\r\nthe three cents per pound tax on raw cotton, which was finally carried.\r\nThis was a move which affected every home, and especially the laboring\r\nclasses; for older ones do not forget how enormously high cotton goods\r\nwere in war times and subsequently, and so have little difficulty in\r\nunderstanding the importance of such a move. It was contended that it\r\nwas a wrong principle to tax the raw production of the soil, and in\r\nconflict with the long-established policy of the nation.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine’s resolves at this time came thick and fast, like\r\nresolutions at New Year’s, but with more purpose in them. Indeed his\r\npurpose is a noticeable feature of every move, and he could state it\r\nin the plainest kind of English, and it was his practice, after a bill\r\nwas read, or resolution presented, to state its meaning, tell just\r\nwhat he meant by it, as the legal forms do not always make it at once\r\napparent. He gives his reasons for the measure. For instance, volunteer\r\nofficers could not be breveted in the regular army for meritorious\r\nservice in the volunteer service. This he saw was wrong, and drew up a\r\nbill in regular form to right the matter, and then states what he means\r\nabout it, and the facts that have moved him, generally move the rest.\r\nAlmost nine-tenths of the new regular army was to be made up of the old\r\nvolunteers, and he would have the old regular army laws changed so as\r\nnot to discriminate against them and in favor of West Pointers.\r\n\r\nThere was no red-tape about him. He did not believe in it. It took\r\ntoo much time, and was too unjust. He believed in solid worth, and in\r\nrewarding it. He is a straight and constant American, and loves all\r\nwho love America, and will not have them dealt unfairly with if it is\r\nin his power to prevent. Fair play is a term he often used during his\r\nearly terms in congress. It seemed to express his ideal of honor. An\r\nunfair man was not respectable in his eyes. It was a right upon which\r\nhe strenuously insisted for himself. He evidently had seen the old\r\ndefinition of freeman, “Who knows his rights and knowing dare maintain.”\r\n\r\nAnd yet this genius of fair play which possessed him, kept him from\r\nbeing a bigot. His sense of justice would rebel against an outrage\r\ninflicted upon anyone. But it is getting to be a hot place in congress.\r\nAndrew Johnson has disappointed the hopes of the nation. He is not\r\nfilling the place of the dead Lincoln, but rather dishonoring it,\r\nand articles of impeachment are originating in the House, summoning\r\nhim before the bar of the senate because of “the crimes and high\r\nmisdemeanors of which he is manifestly and notoriously guilty, and\r\nwhich render it unsafe longer to permit him to exercise the functions\r\nhe has unlawfully assumed.” The air was filled with this matter of\r\nimpeachment during the summer campaign, but on in the dead of winter\r\nthere is no disposition to rush madly or blindly into it. It is but one\r\nof many things demanding attention.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine is as conservative as he is radical. He combines in a very\r\nstrong and decided manner many of the best characteristics of both. He\r\ndoes not rush into everything that comes before the House, but calmly\r\nsurveys and studies, and comes to know the question in its bearings,\r\nand reaches conclusions, and with these truly gained and firmly held,\r\nhe is ready for action.\r\n\r\nThe novelty of a thing makes him suspicious; he must know it through\r\nand through, for when he begins he will surely end. One comes to expect\r\nthat when he presses a measure it will pass, and however much there may\r\nbe to retard its progress, he will never lose sight of it until it goes\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to be a time of political apostasy in the nation. Many are\r\nbetraying their trusts, and a large number fall, politically, to rise\r\nno more. Many of the old war Democrats, like Andrew Johnson, were\r\nsimply Democrats when the war was over. It seemed to be a sort of\r\npolitical reaction after the high pressure of the war. They were not\r\nprepared to accept all the results of the war. It was more than they\r\nhad anticipated, and the result was an unwillingness to proceed, and\r\nso many called a halt; but Thaddeus Stevens in the House, and Charles\r\nSumner in the senate, kept the work planned and the forces in motion.\r\nMr. Stevens formed a strong friendship for Mr. Blaine, and as they were\r\non the military committee together, he learned to respect his talents\r\nand prize his ability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\nCONGRESSIONAL CAREER CONTINUED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 4th of March comes, and with it the fortieth congress, with\r\nSchuyler Colfax, of Indiana, still in the speaker’s chair; Rutherford\r\nB. Hayes, James A. Garfield, and James G. Blaine are in the House.\r\nThey were on their way up to the nation’s honors, and had seats near\r\neach other. The House, rather than the senate, is the place to look\r\nfor presidents. There seems to be no special reason for it, unless it\r\nis that senatorial dignity and greatness are less approachable, not\r\nso easily grasped by the public mind, and farther away from the great\r\nmasses of the people.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine comes to the fortieth congress with the same soldierly\r\nspirit of fearlessness, the same scholarly spirit of intelligence,\r\nthe same genial spirit of friendship, that have borne him through\r\ntwo former terms in Washington. He is now recognized as an adept in\r\nparliamentary law, and is put on with the speaker, Mr. Washburne,\r\nand others to revise the rules of the House, and is found reporting\r\nrule after rule for adoption. He is fairly in training now for the\r\nspeakership, but before that can come he must be re-elected, and he\r\nhas already been elected twice by way of compliment, as it is termed\r\nin Maine. But he is no dreamer, and so devotes himself to business,\r\nwith enough to do, and no idle hours. He is quite methodical, and is\r\nheard frequently insisting upon the regular order of business, and\r\nthat business on the speaker’s stand be attended to, and also that\r\nmembers attend the evening sessions for business. It worries him to\r\nsee business of importance drag, and bills accumulate, and so the\r\nHouse get behind in its work. He uses every parliamentary method to\r\nprevent delays, and seldom is his way hedged up effectually when he\r\nhas determined upon his course, and feels that fidelity to his trust\r\nrequires expedition. He usually gets through without much opposition,\r\nfor good nature in him begets it in others, and so when all are thus\r\nmade willing, as by an opposite disposition they are made unwilling,\r\nit is an easy matter. But when the measure is at all political, as are\r\nsome of the great measures which crystalize the war-victories into\r\nconstitutional enactments, he is put upon his resources for ways and\r\nmeans, and is found usually to be as fertile as the occasion demands.\r\n\r\nHe is down in the Record as an editor, and this places him in relations\r\nof sympathy and friendship with journalists at the capital. He is\r\nknown, and knows them, and shows by the favor of various acts of\r\nkindness that his editorial heart is still beating warm for the drivers\r\nof the quill. There are but three other editors besides himself in the\r\nHouse,--James Brooks, of New York city; Lawrence J. Getz, of Reading;\r\nand Adam J. Glassbremer, of York, Penn.\r\n\r\nGen. John A. Logan sits near enough to Mr. Blaine for them to get well\r\nacquainted, and they are soon found speaking upon the same question of\r\nappropriating seventy-five thousand dollars to purchase seed-corn for\r\nthe South.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly a matter of peculiar interest to look in upon these men\r\nand see them at their work, all unconscious of the great future that\r\nlies before them; some of the time doing what seems like little things,\r\nas when Mr. Blaine moves “to exempt wrapping paper made from wood from\r\ninternal tax,” and Mr. Garfield rises and says, “I ask the gentleman\r\nfrom Maine to allow an amendment by inserting the word ‘corn-stalks,’\r\nwhich,” he added, “was a very important manufacture.” But all of these\r\nlittle things were part of the great internal-revenue tax bill, which\r\nwas to bring millions into the treasury of the nation, and so support\r\nthe government, and pay the war-debt.\r\n\r\nThe impeachment resolutions were having a history in the House, and\r\na reference to them brings out one fact very conclusively,--that Mr.\r\nBlaine was not hot-headed in the sense of rashness. Many were at this\r\ntime,--about a year before the impeachment trial,--filled with alarm,\r\nexcited, aroused, and bent upon the work at once; but Mr. Blaine was\r\ncool, attentive, collected, and studious of the great subject, and he\r\nsaw that as yet the country did not demand it, and so he moved, the\r\nsenate concurring, “That when the House adjourn, on Tuesday next, it be\r\nto meet on Monday, November 11, at twelve o’clock, M.” Some six months\r\nwould intervene, and many objected. General Butler was there, and\r\noffered a vigorous protest. He was for war, vigorous, uncompromising,\r\nand merciless. But Mr. Blaine replied, “I would ask the gentleman from\r\nMassachusetts, through what convention of the people, through what\r\norganism of public opinion, through what channel of general information\r\nanywhere throughout the length and breadth of the land, this demand is\r\nmade upon congress? [It was then March 23, 1867.] Sir, I maintain that\r\nout of the seventeen or eighteen hundred newspapers that represent the\r\nloyal Union party of this country,--and these are the best indices\r\nof public opinion which a party has,--the gentleman cannot find\r\ntwenty-five which regard the impeachment movement as one seriously to\r\nbe undertaken on the part of congress at this time.”\r\n\r\nIt is exceedingly difficult for us now to go back to a year before the\r\nextraordinary spectacle of an impeachment trial of the President of the\r\nUnited States, and recall all the circumstances and the state of the\r\ncountry at that particular time. The best minds in the House seemed to\r\nbe with Mr. Blaine in his feeling, that there was no immediate demand\r\nor warrant for the impeachment of the president. His acts were public,\r\nand known to the people, and from them to their representatives in\r\ncongress must come the demand. Moreover, the resolutions of impeachment\r\nhad been in the hands of a special committee for some months, but they,\r\nagreeing with Mr. Blaine, saw no cause for impetuous action.\r\n\r\nIt was evidently designed to be a matter of wholesome restraint, that\r\nthis preliminary step had been taken. A great many speeches were made\r\nunder the resolution to adjourn, upon the impeachment question.\r\n\r\nMr. Garfield said, “The gentleman said I desired congress to remain in\r\nsession for two reasons; first, to compel the appointment of certain\r\npersons to office [there were several hundred postmasters to be\r\nappointed and confirmed], and second, for the purpose of impeaching the\r\npresident. I call his attention to the fact, that I made no allusion\r\nwhatever to the question of impeachment; I have nothing to say in that\r\ndirection until I hear from the committee. I expressed it as my opinion\r\nmerely that the President of the United States would be very glad to\r\nhave the fortieth congress adjourn, and this I understood from the\r\nfriends of the president.”\r\n\r\nMr. Boutwell, taking part, said, “The great and substantial reason is\r\nthat whether this House shall proceed to impeach the president or not,\r\nthe majority of the people of this country, South and North, black and\r\nwhite, loyal and rebel, have pretty generally lost confidence in him.”\r\n\r\n“That is true,” said Mr. Blaine.\r\n\r\n“Whether this loss of confidence be based upon facts of his character,\r\nor measures of his public policy, or upon suspicion or prejudice\r\nmerely, I do not propose now to inquire. The great fact is, the people\r\nof the country everywhere have lost confidence in the wisdom, if not in\r\nthe honesty, of his administration.”\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine. “The gentleman will allow me to inquire whether he thinks\r\nthat our staying here will restore confidence in the president.”\r\n\r\n“No, Sir.”\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine held the floor under a certain rule of congress, and gave\r\nhis time to others as they desired to discuss the question, but at\r\nthe end was firm as a rock. His mind was unchanged, and from this\r\nand other instances the truth appears, that as he used only facts,\r\nfigures, testimony, experience, written or related evidence of a\r\npersonal character, and that he could not be gainsaid, and was never\r\nmetaphysical, _a priori_, or theorizing in his discussions, so nothing\r\nbut facts or figures, something tangible and real, influenced him. The\r\nsailing of an eagle might be very beautiful, and elicit feelings of\r\nadmiration and sublimity, but it did not influence his judgment.\r\n\r\nOnly the kind of arguments he used to influence other minds would\r\ninfluence his,--and when his mind was made up, it was from just these\r\nsources of evidence that are so convincing, so incontrovertible, giving\r\nstrength to the mind, and putting granite under the feet of the man.\r\n\r\nAs one has said, “I believed, therefore have I spoken”; so with him,\r\nhe believed, and therefore spoke. No surface-current, only the deep\r\nunder-current, moved him.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine has great accuracy in the use of language, and although\r\noff-hand and often under peculiarly distracting circumstances, one\r\nwho followed him quite closely through his various utterances, did\r\nnot discover a grammatical mistake until near the end of the fortieth\r\ncongress, and that was possibly a mistake of the printer, and very\r\nslight in itself, using “to” for “at” in the phrase “strike at the\r\nsenate committee clerks more than it does _to_ ours.”\r\n\r\nCongress adjourned on the 30th of March until the 21st of November,\r\nunless a quorum was present the 3d of July, and if so a session would\r\nbe held. A brief session of two weeks was held, but Mr. Blaine was\r\nnot there. He and Elihu B. Washburne and another congressman were in\r\nEurope. It was Mr. Blaine’s first trip. Liverpool was visited, and\r\ncommercial interests were studied. Imagination seldom furnishes right\r\nimpressions. No one about whom we have heard ever looks as we expected\r\nhe was going to. It always gets great men too large on the outside,\r\nand enormous cities either too large or too small, as the case may be.\r\nLiverpool was immense; it has to be so. Almost limitless is England’s\r\nforeign trade. What men they must have been to make their island so\r\nimportant as to compel the commerce of the world to visit them! It was\r\nwonderful; the ships and cargoes for all of India, for Egypt, for all\r\nof Europe, for Australia, for America, and the Indies, for Mexico,\r\nChina and Japan.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed a study for him whose mind must find the merits of every\r\nsubject. It was not simply a matter of landing safely and boarding a\r\ntrain for London. The war was but two years over. The Alabama was not\r\nforgotten, nor all of England’s mischief. Ships and shipping in all\r\ntheir construction and competition had been the study of years to him,\r\nand to take in those busy scenes upon the Mersey and the Clyde, was but\r\nthe reading of a new book to one familiar with the language.\r\n\r\nThey reach the great metropolis. Parliament is their objective point.\r\nFew will have more brains than they bring with them, or know more about\r\ntheir affairs of state; but the study is to be long and careful, and\r\nthey are to know more fully the inner life and character of those who\r\nhave made laws for half the world. Day after day, week after week,\r\nthe great Head Centre in all its ramifications is studied at shortest\r\npossible range.\r\n\r\nBut Scotland and Ireland must be visited, for they are the home of his\r\nancestors. He breathes the air, he sees the sky, he presses the sod, he\r\ntouches the heather. He is really, truly there. The dream of boyhood\r\ndays, when he stood by grandfather’s knee, and heard of the old clans,\r\nthe blowing of the horn, and the echoes down the valleys, of the cows\r\nand sheep, and the tinkling of the bells, the clash of arms and the\r\nbattles won; and now he is there, thrilled with the memories and the\r\nancient scenes. The old castles, quaint, and moss-covered, and grand,\r\nand the people with their fresh look and fiery eye, vigilant ever to\r\nthe end of time. What valleys and mountains and peoples are there; what\r\nrivers and lakes and loud-sounding sea! Surely nothing short of an\r\naffair of the Stuarts would compel them to quit their strongholds and\r\ntheir homes, their native heather, and flee to other lands, so far, so\r\nvery far away as it was then, back in that olden time.\r\n\r\nWhat events have transpired since that 1720, nearly one hundred and\r\nfifty years before. What events in Europe, England and America. What in\r\nIndia and the Orient; and yet the man of eighty had sat, a boy of five,\r\nupon his grandsire’s knee who had rounded out his four-score years, and\r\na boy of ten had walked with him upon the highlands, and so could bring\r\nthe messages of that far-off time to present generations.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Garfield had “during his only visit to England busied himself\r\nin searching out every trace of his forefathers in parish-registries\r\nand ancient army-rolls,” so his inheritor of the nation’s honors traced\r\nback the stock from which he sprang to mountain, glen, and castle,\r\nwhich had rung with the name he bore. He too might say, sitting with a\r\nfriend in the gallery of the House of Commons, “that when patriots of\r\nEnglish blood had struck sturdy blows for constitutional government and\r\nhuman liberty, his family had been represented.”\r\n\r\nBut they continue their journey, and cross the English channel from\r\nDover to Calais, and soon are in the capital of the French Empire.\r\nNapoleon III is there in his glory. Two years later his traveling\r\ncompanion, Hon. E. B. Washburne, is to be United States minister at his\r\ncourt, and not long after a prisoner in Paris during its siege in the\r\nFranco-Prussian war.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine’s knowledge of French serves him, and enables him to\r\nsecure all the general information he desired. He was not among free\r\ninstitutions now, and felt the keen chill in the very atmosphere. But\r\nin visiting the French Assembly there was a show of liberty, like\r\nan eagle in a cage. It was a noisy, tumultuous scene, with a jargon\r\nindescribable and largely unintelligible. Few things are wilder, except\r\nthe ocean in a storm, than the deliberative assembly of the French\r\nnation when measures of special importance are pending. But the great\r\ncity, with its multitudes of people, is full of attractions.\r\n\r\nThe Tuilleries is visited, and the Champs Elysées, the great armies\r\nso soon to reel in the shock of war, and learn a lesson of sobriety\r\nand contented home-life that shall give to the French of the future\r\na greatness that has in it more of the element of stability and\r\npermanency, and so tone down their mercurial and volatile nature. The\r\nRhine is visited, and Florence.\r\n\r\nRelaxation and rest are great objects of the visit. The malaria of the\r\nPotomac at Washington, which gets into the bones of congressmen, and\r\nsenators, and presidents, must be gotten out of him, and he made ready\r\nfor greater service and larger conquests.\r\n\r\nHistory is all about him; the nations of Europe are within his\r\nreach; their capitals are visited, and they are studied from life.\r\nImpressions deep, and strong, and lasting are made. Plutarch’s old\r\nmethod of comparisons and contrasts still serves him, and he gets his\r\nknowledge in classified, compact forms. The people and their condition,\r\ntheir rulers and the laws, interest him as much as the great, queer\r\nbuildings, the splendid palaces, the magnificent cathedrals, the\r\nvaried works of art, and the giant mountains, the beautiful villages,\r\nvalleys, and lakes, and all that is picturesque in nature. Switzerland\r\nis a charm; Italy a delight, and the whole journey a joy. He returns a\r\nbroader, deeper, wiser man, to live a stronger, richer life in a larger\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nHe was in his seat at the beginning of congress in November. Eight\r\nmen are there from Tennessee, whose right to seats is challenged. The\r\nimpeachment question has gained prominence, and he joins in the search\r\nfor evidence. He does not want hearsay, but official documents, and so\r\nhe introduces a resolution, calling upon the general commanding the\r\narmies to communicate to the House any and all correspondence addressed\r\nby him to the president upon the removal of Secretary Stanton and\r\nGeneral Sheridan, and General Sickles as well; and also with reference\r\nto the proposed mission of the general of the army to Mexico in 1866.\r\n\r\nBut his great friend, Senator Fessenden, is now secretary of the\r\ntreasury, and this gives the financial question a new interest, and he\r\ncomes to the front in a most vigorous manner as vindicator and defender\r\nof the secretary’s financial policy, in one of his great speeches on\r\nthe currency.\r\n\r\nIt is quite early in the session, only five days after congress\r\nconvened. His friend, Mr. Washburne, had taken the initiatory step by\r\nmoving they go into committee of the whole on the state of the Union.\r\n\r\nMr. Dawes was in the chair, and the question related to the reduction\r\nof the currency. Erroneous and mischievous views had been put forward,\r\nregarding the nature of the public obligation imposed by the debt of\r\nthe United States. Various forms of repudiation had been suggested.\r\nMr. Pendleton, the recent Democratic candidate for vice-president,\r\nand General Butler, of Massachusetts, had assumed the position that\r\n“the principal and the interest of United States bonds, known as the\r\nfive-twenties, may be fairly and legally paid in paper currency by the\r\ngovernment, after the expiration of five years from the date of the\r\nissue.”\r\n\r\nAnd just here we get a view of Mr. Blaine’s power of analysis; the\r\nability of his mind to grasp a subject in its great features and\r\nfundamental principles; to bring to the surface its underlying points\r\nor elements of strength and weakness, so classified and arranged as to\r\nstate them in logical and convincing propositions, and all of them most\r\npractical in their character.\r\n\r\n1. “The position contravenes the honor and good faith of the national\r\ngovernment.” And this was the final view adhered to by the best\r\nstatesmen of the Republican party.\r\n\r\n2. “It is hostile to the spirit and letter of the law.\r\n\r\n3. “It contemptuously ignores the common understanding between borrower\r\nand lender at the time the loan was negotiated (which was by Jay Cooke\r\n& Co. in 1863, to the extent of five hundred million dollars), a large\r\nproportion of which was purchased by foreign capitalists, and was very\r\nsuccessful. Nothing was said about payment in gold, but payment in\r\ngold, both of principal and interest, had been the invariable rule from\r\nthe foundation of the government.”\r\n\r\n“Our government,” said Nathaniel Mason, “is a hard-money government,\r\nfounded by hard-money men, and its debts are hard-money debts.”\r\n\r\nNothing was intimated to the contrary when the bill was passed and the\r\nbonds issued, and the duties on imports pledged to their payment, were\r\nto be paid in coin. The final point in his argument was:--\r\n\r\n4. “It would prove disastrous to the financial interests of the\r\ngovernment, and the general prosperity of the country,” by, of course,\r\nreducing the par value of the bonds and blockading their sale as they\r\nfloated through the markets of the world.\r\n\r\nIt should be with some pride and glory now, after the honorable history\r\nof the national debt thus far, and which has given to the nation the\r\ncredit of the world, that Mr. Blaine remembers that so early in the\r\ndiscussion, when the ideas of the many were crude, and only those of\r\nthe few were clear, that he closed his speech with these splendid\r\nwords,--words which embody the steady policy of the government from\r\nthat time to the present:--\r\n\r\n“I am sure,” said Mr. Blaine, “that in the peace which our arms have\r\nconquered, we shall not dishonor ourselves by withholding from any\r\npublic creditor a dollar that we promised to pay him; nor seek by\r\ncunning construction and clever afterthought to evade or escape the\r\nfull responsibility of our national indebtedness. It will doubtless\r\ncost us a vast sum to pay that indebtedness, but it will cost us\r\nincalculably more not to pay it.”\r\n\r\nIt took Gen. Benj. F. Butler two days to reply to this speech of Mr.\r\nBlaine’s, in which he bloomed forth as a greenbacker of fullest flower\r\nand strongest fragrance. This led Mr. Blaine to say:--\r\n\r\n“We have a loan distinctly defined, well known to the people,\r\nthat has a specific rate of interest, a certain time to run, and\r\nexpress condition on which it is to be paid; but the gentleman from\r\nMassachusetts is for brushing this all aside and placing before the\r\ncountry a species of legal-tender notes which have no fixed time\r\nto run, bear no interest, have no standard of value, and which the\r\ngovernment is under no obligation to pay at any particular time, and\r\nwhich may indeed never be called in for redemption.”\r\n\r\nAnd all of this reminded Mr. Blaine of a story:--\r\n\r\n“I think the gentleman must have borrowed his notions of finance from\r\na man who failed a few years since in one of the eastern cities of\r\nMaine, and who wrote over his store-door, ‘Payment suspended for thirty\r\ndays.’ A neighbor passing by said to him, ‘You have neglected to date\r\nyour notice.’ ‘Why, no,’ said he, ‘I did not intend to date it; it\r\nwould run out if I did.’ And so the gentleman was to issue a government\r\nlegal tender that never runs out.”\r\n\r\nThe sitting of congress during the winter of 1867 and 1868, was\r\nlong and tedious, extending from November on into July. Mr. Blaine\r\nwas on the committee on appropriations, and had charge of the\r\narmy-appropriation bill on its passage through the House. The army had\r\nbeen reduced to sixty regiments, and thirty-two million dollars asked\r\nto pay them, while before the war twenty-five million dollars for the\r\narmy, consisting of only nineteen, or as Mr. Blaine put it, “a regiment\r\nunder the Democratic administration preceding the war cost more than\r\ndouble in gold what it costs now under General Grant in paper, or in\r\nother words, that it cost on an average over a million of dollars in\r\ngold to a regiment then, and when General Grant was in charge, about\r\nhalf a million to a regiment.”\r\n\r\nIt required great patience, courage, and intelligence to stand by\r\nsuch a bill for two or three days, answer all questions, meet all\r\nobjections and opposition, and keep sweet all through; for it was\r\nmade a political question, as nearly every measure was, and so the\r\nopposition party would sit there and resist and vote in a bunch, but\r\nusually to no purpose. The great impeachment trial had come on, and was\r\nbeing conducted by the senate in the presence of members of the House.\r\n\r\nThis caused their adjournment after the morning hour until three\r\no’clock, daily. The managers of the trial, chosen by the House, were\r\nJohn A. Bingham, George S. Boutwell, James F. Wilson, Benjamin F.\r\nButler, Thomas Williams, John A. Logan, and Thaddeus Stevens.\r\n\r\nHaving faithfully performed all his work upon the great committee, and\r\nseen to it that every trust confided to him in congress was sacredly\r\ndischarged, he procured an indefinite leave of absence, after being\r\nthere day and night for some eight months, and not being one of the\r\nmanagers of the impeachment trial, and having no active part to take in\r\nits proceedings, and so he went home to conduct the summer campaign,\r\ngiving himself, however, but two months for this purpose. He had been\r\nabsent in Europe, the summer before, and now he had been re-nominated\r\nto congress for the fourth time, something unusual in the district, as\r\nhe had been elected three times already.\r\n\r\nIt would not do to fail, having been thus honored by his party. So\r\nnotwithstanding his long, hard siege in congress, and which had\r\nbrought him more than ever into official communication with heads of\r\ndepartments and the general of the army, he devotes July and August to\r\nhard campaign-work, discussing before the people the great questions\r\nof the currency, and the war-debt, etc., that had filled his mind in\r\ncongress. His experience there had been just the needed preparation\r\nfor this field-work, which was little more than justifying their\r\ncongressional actions and explaining them.\r\n\r\nThe great question of the campaign was, “hard or soft money,” as it\r\nwas called. The seeds of the greenback heresy, it will be recalled,\r\nhad been sown broadcast in Mr. Garfield’s Western Reserve district in\r\nOhio, and the convention met to renominate him had declared for soft\r\nmoney, when he was called in for a speech. He was a hard-money man, and\r\nnothing else, and could not stultify himself. He was begged by friends\r\nnot to antagonize the convention, but his firm reply was, “I shall not\r\nviolate my conscience and my principles in this matter,” and so he\r\nmade it known to the convention without any compromise. It was such an\r\nexhibition of courage, integrity, and of all manly power, that they\r\nnominated him at once by acclamation.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine encountered the same heresy, and wrung its neck most\r\nvigorously. He was up in the art, as he had just had extensive\r\nexperience in congress. But 1868 was a presidential year. U. S. Grant\r\nand Horatio Seymour were the candidates.\r\n\r\nOne president was being impeached, and another being elected. Mr.\r\nBlaine had done what was necessary for him in the case of one, and\r\nnow was doing what he could for the other. He had not taken the most\r\nadvanced grounds regarding the impeachment. He was quite inclined to be\r\nconservative; and while he did not oppose, neither did he vehemently\r\ndemand it at all hazards. It was serious business, and he viewed it\r\nwith the broad, comprehensive mind of a statesman.\r\n\r\nIt was like “tearing up the foundation of things,” as he said. He had a\r\ndeep and delicate sense of honor about it. The president was the chief\r\nman of the nation, there by the suffrages of a great people. Results\r\nseem to show that all were finally brought to Mr. Blaine’s conclusions,\r\nif not to his temper of mind upon the subject. He simply did not\r\nmake any violent speeches in its favor, as so many did, but acted\r\neffectively with his party for the right. His strength was used in the\r\ncampaign. He wanted a new president of the right stamp, and knew that\r\nif faithful work was done, they would have one in less than a year. So\r\nto this task he addressed himself with his accustomed energies, and not\r\nwithout success, which had come to be almost a matter of course, though\r\nhard, hot fights were made against him.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant received two hundred and fourteen votes in the electoral\r\ncollege, to eighty-four for Mr. Seymour, and again the Republican sky\r\nwas ablaze with great and wide-spread victory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\nSPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IN CONGRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe future had no clouds for Mr. Blaine as he returned for the fourth\r\ntime to Washington as a member-elect to congress. He was in manhood’s\r\nprime, backed by a splendid record of triumph on the field of political\r\ncontest, and of achievement in the arena of debate. He was thoroughly\r\nconversant with the affairs of the House in every detail of rule or\r\nmeasure, and was widely known and recognized as among the most popular\r\nand efficient members. His knowledge, gathered from wide fields of\r\ntravel, experience, and observation, was vast; his powers thoroughly\r\ndisciplined and under the finest control; his acquaintance extensive,\r\nand his rank high in personal and political friendships.\r\n\r\nSchuyler Colfax, the former speaker, was vice-president now; standing\r\nnext to General Grant, the new president. Who should take his place?\r\nThis was the question that filled Mr. Blaine with high anticipations.\r\n\r\nGranting his fitness and ability, which, perhaps, no one who knows him\r\nat all would question, the still greater question is how to win the\r\nprize, how to secure the position. It is purely a question of votes,\r\nand the one thing that secures them is personal influence. It may come\r\nof the individual’s own exertions, his power to command, the charm\r\nof his name, the fascination of his character, the magnetism of his\r\nperson. But it is a matter of stupendous strength and of transcendent\r\nabilities for one to lift himself so far above his fellows as to win\r\ntheir suffrages in such a place as that, by his own unaided personal\r\nattractions.\r\n\r\nHere was the great argument, but not the active agent. There must be\r\nsome one to state the case, to manage it, to make the appeal, some one\r\nstrong friend or more, who has grit and gumption to put it through,\r\nand see it done,--that man is Thaddeus Stevens, of his native state of\r\nPennsylvania. He is the one of all others to do this thing.\r\n\r\nOf few men’s power Mr. Blaine had a loftier idea than of Mr. Thaddeus\r\nStevens. There was indeed a trio who attracted and held the admiration\r\nof Mr. Blaine, and he has sketched their characters most vividly. Will\r\nyou hear him as he says:--\r\n\r\n“The three most distinguished parliamentary leaders hitherto developed\r\nin this country, are Mr. Clay, Mr. Douglas, and Mr. Thaddeus Stevens.\r\nThey were all men of consummate ability, of great earnestness, of\r\nintense personality, differing widely each from the others, and yet\r\nwith a single trait in common,--the power to command. In the give and\r\ntake of daily discussion, in the art of controlling and consolidating\r\nreluctant and refractory followers, in the skill to overcome all forms\r\nof opposition, and to meet with competency and courage the varying\r\nphases of unlooked-for assault, or unsuspected defection, it would be\r\ndifficult to rank with these a fourth name in all our congressional\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n“But of these Mr. Clay was the greatest. It would, perhaps, be\r\nimpossible to find in parliamentary annals, greater power than when,\r\nin 1841, at sixty-four years of age, he took the control of the Whig\r\nparty from the president who had received their suffrages, against the\r\npower of Webster in the cabinet, against the eloquence of Choate in the\r\nsenate, against the herculean efforts of Caleb Cushing and Henry A.\r\nWise in the House. In unshared leadership, in the pride and plenitude\r\nof power, he hurled against John Tyler, with deepest scorn, the mass\r\nof that conquering column which had swept over the land in 1840, and\r\ndrove his administration to shelter behind the lines of his political\r\nfoes.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Douglas achieved a victory scarcely less wonderful, when, in 1854,\r\nagainst the secret desires of a strong administration, against the wise\r\ncounsel of the older chiefs, against the conservative instincts and\r\neven the moral sense of the country, he forced a reluctant congress\r\ninto a repeal of the Missouri Compromise.\r\n\r\n“And now we come to Mr. Thaddeus Stevens, who, in his contests from\r\n1865 to 1868, actually advanced his parliamentary leadership until\r\ncongress tied the hands of the president, and governed the country by\r\nits own will, leaving only perfunctionary duties to be discharged by\r\nthe executive. With two hundred millions of patronage in his hands at\r\nthe opening of the contest, aided by the active force of Seward in the\r\ncabinet, and the moral power of Chase on the bench, Andrew Johnson\r\ncould not command the support of one-third in either House against the\r\nparliamentary uprising of which Thaddeus Stevens was the animating\r\nspirit and the unquestioned leader.”\r\n\r\nAnd this was the man who stood at Mr. Blaine’s right hand in this\r\nmatter of the speakership.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine was on the committee of military affairs with Mr.\r\nStevens. He became known to him thoroughly as a man with talent for\r\nindefatigable toil, and a genius for doing hard and difficult things\r\nwith great certainty and despatch. He was just the man to attract\r\nthe attention, and be admired, respected, and loved by a man of Mr.\r\nStevens’ consummate ability, and to be selected by him for promotion\r\nand honor. And the hour had come for just that honor, the highest in\r\nthe gift of the House.\r\n\r\nIt was the third office in the nation, with a salary three thousand\r\ndollars greater than that of United States senator, and equal to the\r\nsalary of vice-president or secretary of state. And so by virtue of\r\nhis recognized fitness, and the power of this great friend, the office\r\ncomes to him, and he comes to it.\r\n\r\nSome think, and perhaps rightly, that his tilt with Mr. Conkling\r\npopularized him greatly with the members of the House, who thoroughly\r\nenjoyed it, and so prepared the way to the honor which in point of fact\r\nwas his by right of nature. But six years was a long time to wait, yet\r\nhe waited, and was rewarded. And still it was not waiting, but working,\r\nwith him, occupying the stronghold he had made for himself in the\r\nmanifold business of the House.\r\n\r\nBut now he is taken from this, and out of the arena of debate, and yet\r\nlifted into greater prominence and power; appointing all the great\r\ncommittees of the House, a task requiring the highest order of ability\r\nin the knowledge of men; deciding all questions, and exercising a\r\ncontrolling influence over legislation.\r\n\r\nThere is little power men employ in all the great work of life, but he\r\nneeds it in its rarest form. He must be a broad, a wide, a universal\r\nman; in sympathy with all, so far as right and justice are concerned.\r\nThere are the choice, the crowned ones from every congressional\r\ndistrict in all the states and territories, and he is the choice, the\r\ncrowned one among them,--their chosen chief.\r\n\r\nTennyson’s words press for utterance right here, as we see him step\r\nfrom the floor to the speaker’s chair:--\r\n\r\n  “Divinely gifted man,\r\n    Whose life in low estate began,\r\n  And on a simple village green.\r\n\r\n  “Who breaks his birth’s invidious bar,\r\n    And grasps the skirts of happy chance,\r\n    And breasts the blow of circumstance,\r\n  And grapples with his evil star.\r\n\r\n  “Who makes by force his merit known,\r\n    And lives to clutch the golden keys,\r\n    To mould a mighty state’s decrees,\r\n  And shape the whisper of the throne.\r\n\r\n  “And moving up from high to higher,\r\n    Becomes on Fortune’s crowning slope\r\n    The pillar of a people’s hope,\r\n  The centre of a world’s desire.”\r\n\r\nIt was only by the proof of character, the most solid and reliable,\r\nhe could possibly have secured the friendship of Mr. Stevens. And not\r\nhis alone, but the friendship of Hon. Elihu B. Washburne, of Illinois,\r\nwho nominated Mr. Blaine as candidate for speaker, and who, as senior\r\nmember, swore him in.\r\n\r\nIt was a proud day for Mr. Washburne, the staunch friend of General\r\nGrant, to witness his inaugural, and then, as the true friend of Mr.\r\nBlaine, aid so largely in putting him into the speaker’s chair the same\r\nday.\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens was not there to enjoy the triumph of his friend, but his\r\nendorsement was good as a letter of credit.\r\n\r\nWhen the ballot was concluded it read:--Whole number of votes cast,\r\none hundred and ninety-two; necessary for a choice, ninety-seven;\r\nMr. Blaine received one hundred and thirty-five; Mr. Kerr received\r\nfifty-seven.\r\n\r\nMr. Dawes and Mr. Kerr conducted him to the chair, when he addressed\r\nthe House as follows:--\r\n\r\n  “GENTLEMEN OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\n  “I thank you profoundly for the great honor which your votes have\r\n  just conferred upon me. The gratification which this signal mark\r\n  of your confidence brings to me, finds its only drawback in the\r\n  diffidence with which I assume the weighty duties devolving upon me.\r\n  Succeeding to a chair made illustrious by such eminent statesmen,\r\n  and skilled parliamentarians as Clay, and Stevenson, and Polk, and\r\n  Winthrop, and Banks, and Grow, and Colfax, I may well distrust my\r\n  ability to meet the just expectations of those who have shown me such\r\n  marked partiality. But relying, gentlemen, upon my honest purpose\r\n  to perform all my duties faithfully and fearlessly, and trusting in\r\n  a large measure to the indulgence which I am sure you will always\r\n  extend to me, I shall hope to retain, as I have secured, your\r\n  confidence, your kindly regard, and your generous support.\r\n\r\n  “The forty-first congress assembles at an auspicious period in the\r\n  history of our government. The splendid and impressive ceremonial\r\n  which we have just witnessed in another part of the capitol [Grant’s\r\n  inauguration], appropriately symbolizes the triumphs of the past,\r\n  and the hopes of the future, a great chieftain, whose sword at the\r\n  head of gallant and victorious armies, saved the Republic from\r\n  dismemberment and ruin, has been fitly called to the highest civic\r\n  honor which a grateful people can bestow. Sustained by a congress\r\n  which so ably represents the loyalty, the patriotism, and the\r\n  personal worth of the nation, the president this day inaugurated will\r\n  assure to the country an administration of purity, fidelity, and\r\n  prosperity; an era of liberty regulated by law, and of law thoroughly\r\n  inspired with liberty.\r\n\r\n  “Congratulating you, gentlemen, on the happy auguries of the day, and\r\n  invoking the gracious blessings of Almighty God on the arduous and\r\n  responsible labors before you, I am now ready to take the oath of\r\n  office, and enter upon the discharge of the duties to which you have\r\n  called me.”\r\n\r\nIt is a curious coincidence that General Schenck, of Ohio, who startled\r\nMr. Blaine with the charge of irrelevancy at his first utterance on the\r\nfloor, but was so utterly discomfited afterwards, is now the first one\r\nto address him as “Mr. Speaker,” and Mr. Kerr, his competitor, soon\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\nIt was at this session that new members from reconstructed states\r\nappeared, and many were the objections made to this new member and\r\nthat, because of disloyalty. It was to present a charge of this kind\r\nthat Mr. Schenck arose.\r\n\r\nThe noticeable feature of Mr. Blaine’s speakership is the expeditious\r\nmanner in which business is conducted, and the consequent brevity of\r\nsessions.\r\n\r\nIt may be observed right here that Mr. Blaine’s friend, E. B.\r\nWashburne, chose rather to go as minister to Paris, and Hamilton Fish\r\nbecame secretary of state.\r\n\r\nFor two successive congresses Mr. Blaine was re-elected speaker by the\r\nlarge Republican majorities serving through the reconstruction period\r\nof the rebel states, and through most of General Grant’s two terms of\r\nthe presidency. It was during this period his reputation became truly\r\nnational.\r\n\r\nHe might have occupied the chair all the time, and taken things easy;\r\nbut this was not his nature. It was his privilege to go upon the floor,\r\nand take up the gauntlet of debate. It was expected that things would\r\nbecome lively at once when he did so. There was a resolution one day\r\nfor a committee to investigate the outrages in the South. Mr. Blaine\r\nhad written the resolution, which was presented by his colleague, and\r\nasked for its passage; and, lest the _claquers_ should say he put only\r\n“weak-kneed Republicans” on the committee, he made Benj. F. Butler\r\nchairman, which in some almost unaccountable way greatly enraged Mr.\r\nButler, who might have then contemplated accompanying Gen. John M.\r\nPalmer and others into the Democratic party, and so he telegraphed\r\nto newspapers and issued a circular which appeared on the desks of\r\nmembers, denouncing what he was pleased to call a trick, and used other\r\nvigorous language on the floor of the House. Of course the speaker\r\ncould not sit quietly in the chair and be thus tempestuously assailed,\r\nso calling a future vice-president to the chair (Wheeler), he said, “I\r\nwish to ask the gentleman from Massachusetts whether he denies me the\r\nright to have drawn that resolution” (it was presented in the caucus\r\nfirst which had just re-nominated Mr. Blaine for speaker).\r\n\r\nMr. Butler replied, “I have made no assertion on that subject, one way\r\nor other.”\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine: “Did not the gentleman know distinctly that I drew it?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir!” was the reply.\r\n\r\n“Did I not take it to the gentleman and read it to him?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” replied Mr. Butler.\r\n\r\n“Did I not show him the manuscript?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” was the reply.\r\n\r\n“And at his suggestion,” continued Mr. Blaine, “I added these words,\r\n‘and the expenses of said committee shall be paid from the contingent\r\nfund of the House of Representatives’ (applause), and the fact that\r\nways and means were wanted to pay the expenses was the only objection\r\nhe made to it.”\r\n\r\nIt appears that the resolution was considered as a test of the\r\nRepublicanism of members. General Butler had been asked to take the\r\nchairmanship, but refused, and said he would have nothing to do with\r\nthe resolution; but Mr. Blaine put him on the committee, and when\r\nasked why, replied, “Because I knew very well that if I omitted the\r\nappointment of the gentleman it would be heralded throughout the\r\nlength and breadth of the country by the _claquers_, who have so\r\nindustriously distributed this letter this morning, that the speaker\r\nhad packed the committee, as the gentleman said he would, with\r\n‘weak-kneed Republicans,’ who would not go into an investigation\r\nvigorously, as he would. That was the reason (applause), so that\r\nthe chair laid the responsibility upon the gentleman of declining\r\nthe appointment, and now the gentleman from Massachusetts is on his\r\nresponsibility before the country,” and there we leave him.\r\n\r\nIt can but be with peculiar interest that we read the strong words of\r\nthe oath taken so repeatedly by Mr. Blaine, and administered the second\r\ntime by Mr. Dawes, of Massachusetts, after he had received one hundred\r\nand twenty-six votes, to ninety-two for Gen. George W. Morgan, of Ohio.\r\n\r\nIt kept a large committee busy to pass upon the character of\r\nmembers-elect and the legality of their election. Such was the broken\r\ncondition of state governments in the South, so battered by war, and\r\ndistracted by schism and contending factions. All of these perplexities\r\nadhered to applicants for membership in congress, presenting\r\ncredentials of membership various in value as greenbacks and gold, and\r\nthese same perplexities affected the staple of congressional measures.\r\n\r\nCongress was increasing rapidly in the number of its members, so\r\nthat while one hundred and ninety-two votes were cast at Mr. Blaine’s\r\nfirst election to the speakership in 1869, there were two hundred and\r\nsixty-nine votes cast at his election to the same office in 1873, of\r\nwhich number he received one hundred and eighty-nine, and Mr. Ferdinand\r\nWood received seventy-six.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine refers to it in his address to the “Gentlemen of the House\r\nof Representatives,” the last time he was elected speaker. “To be\r\nchosen,” he says, “speaker of the House of Representatives is always\r\nan honorable distinction; to be chosen a third time enhances the honor\r\nmore than three fold; to be chosen _by the largest body that ever\r\nassembled in the Capitol_ imposes a burden of responsibility which only\r\nyour indulgent kindness could embolden me to assume. The first occupant\r\nof this chair presided over a House of sixty-five members, representing\r\na population far below the present aggregate of the state of New York.\r\nAt that time there were not, in the whole United States, fifty thousand\r\ncivilized inhabitants to be found one hundred miles distant from the\r\nflow of the Atlantic tide. To-day, gentlemen, a large majority of you\r\ncome from beyond that limit, and represent districts peopled then only\r\nby the Indian and the adventurous frontiersman.\r\n\r\n“The national government is not yet as old as many of its citizens,\r\nbut in this brief span of time,--less than one lengthened life,--it\r\nhas, under God’s good providence, extended its power until a continent\r\nis the field of its empire, and attests the majesty of its law.\r\n\r\n“With the growth of new states and the resulting changes in the centres\r\nof population, new interests are developed, rival to the old, but by no\r\nmeans hostile; diverse, but not antagonistic. Nay, rather are all these\r\ninterests in harmony, and _the true science of just government is to\r\ngive to each its full and fair play, oppressing none by undue exaction,\r\nfavoring none by undue privilege_.\r\n\r\n“It is this great lesson which our daily experience is teaching,\r\nbinding us together more closely, making our mutual dependence more\r\nmanifest, and causing us to feel that, whether we live in the North\r\nor in the South, in the East or in the West, we have indeed but ‘one\r\ncountry, one constitution, one destiny.’”\r\n\r\nFew addresses so brief breathe a spirit of broader statesmanship,\r\nor loftier ideal of civil government. Two years before this, in\r\n1871, he had been charged by General Butler with having presidential\r\naspirations, and surely he was able to manifest the true conception of\r\na just and righteous government, “oppressing none by undue exaction,\r\nfavoring none by undue privilege,” which is apparently the exact\r\noutcome--a sort of paraphrase of Lincoln’s words, “With malice toward\r\nnone, with charity toward all.”\r\n\r\nMany who had participated in the Rebellion, having had their political\r\ndisabilities removed by the vote of two-thirds of each House of\r\ncongress, came forward and took the special oath provided for them by\r\nact of July 11, 1868.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine seldom, if ever, leaves the chair to participate in debate\r\nwhen questions of a political nature are pending, so that he may hold\r\nhimself aloof for fair ruling in all of his decisions.\r\n\r\nThe position of speaker is, in many respects, a thankless one. When\r\nparty spirit runs high, as it does at times, like the tide of battle,\r\nin the great debates, men are swept on by their sympathies, as\r\nbarks are tossed in ocean-storms, and under the influence of their\r\nmost powerful prejudices they are driven to rash and unwarrantable\r\nconclusions regarding the justice of any ruling, to conjectures the\r\nmost unfair and wanton regarding motive, and as in the case of Mr.\r\nBlaine, to the most stupendous efforts at political assassination.\r\n\r\nBut it was not until the days of his speakership were over, and the\r\npeople at home had expressed their confidence in him and their love and\r\nadmiration for him, by electing him to congress for the seventh time\r\nconsecutively, that the storm struck him. It had been gathering long.\r\nIts animus was enmity, its bulk was hate, its dark, frowning exterior\r\nwas streaked with the lurid lightnings of a baleful jealousy; muttering\r\nthunders like the deep growlings of exasperation were heard oft, but\r\nfeared not.\r\n\r\nThe solid South had marched its rebel brigadiers by the score into the\r\narena of national questioning and discussion, where for twelve years\r\nhe had stood intrepid as the founders of the Republic. No man was more\r\nat home upon that field than he,--none more familiar with the men, the\r\nmethods, and the measures that had triumphed there,--and few have been\r\nmore victorious in the great ends for which he strove, few readier to\r\nchallenge the coming of any man, to know his rights, his mission, and\r\nhis weight. He was, of all men, the most unconquerable by those who\r\nplead for measures subversive of any great or minor end for which the\r\nwar was fought.\r\n\r\nHe had gained the credit of the fourteenth amendment, and had been\r\nidentified with all. He was simply bent upon resistance, the most\r\npowerful he could command, against all encroachments of the bad and\r\nfalse, and to show no favor toward any feature for which rebellion\r\nfought. Fair, honorable, just,--none could be more so.\r\n\r\nWhen speaker of the House, he was informed one day that a prominent\r\ncorrespondent of a leading paper, who had maligned and vilified\r\nhim shockingly, was on the floor, and at once he said, “Invite him\r\nup here,” and he gave him a seat by his side, within the speaker’s\r\ndesk, and placed at the disposal of the man the information of public\r\nimportance at his command. The fellow was amazed, and went away and\r\nwrote how kindly he had been treated by the great-hearted man of noble\r\nimpulses, after he had so roundly abused him.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing vindictive about him, nothing despicable. He is\r\nsevere, herculean, desperate for the right, and will win in every\r\nbattle that commands the forces of his being, if victory be achievable.\r\nBut he honors strong, square men, who have convictions and dare\r\nproclaim them; but petty, mean, ignoble souls are first despised, then\r\npitied.\r\n\r\nBut the day of his betrayal came, the day of rebel wrath; and he met\r\nthe stroke before the nation’s gaze, and was vindicated before the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nA business correspondence, it had been said he had burned. He said,\r\n“No, there it is, and I will read it to the House,” and he read it.\r\nWhat business firm, it has been asked, would like to have their\r\ncorrespondence regarding any great business interest, read to those\r\nwho are filled with all manner of suspicions, and so have it misjudged,\r\nmisinterpreted, and misapplied? And then, to show the temper of those\r\nwith whom he dealt, a cablegram from Europe vindicating him, was for\r\ntwo days suppressed by the chairman of the congressional committee,\r\nbefore whom he stood, and who failed to convict him by any document at\r\ntheir command. The scene at that time, and their discomfiture, is thus\r\ndescribed by an eye-witness:--\r\n\r\n“His management of his own case when the Mulligan letters came out\r\nwas worthy of any general who ever set a squadron in the field. For\r\nnearly fifteen years I have looked down from the galleries of the House\r\nand Senate, and I never saw, and never expect to see, and never have\r\nread of such a scene, where the grandeur of human effort was better\r\nillustrated, than when this great orator rushed down the aisle, and,\r\nin the very face of Proctor Knott, charged him with suppressing a\r\ntelegram favorable to Blaine. The whole floor and all the galleries\r\nwere wild with excitement. Men yelled and cheered, women waved their\r\nhandkerchiefs and went off into hysterics, and the floor was little\r\nless than a mob.”\r\n\r\nAbout this time, Hon. Lot M. Morrill, of his state, was transferred\r\nfrom the senate to the cabinet of President Grant, and as a partial\r\njustification, General Connor, the governor of Maine at this time,\r\nappointed him to represent Maine in the United States senate in place\r\nof Mr. Morrill. The official note was as follows:--\r\n\r\n                                          “AUGUSTA, Maine, July 9, 1876.\r\n\r\n  “TO HON. MILTON SAYLOR, _Speaker of the House of\r\n      Representatives, Washington, D. C._:\r\n\r\n  “Having tendered to the Hon. James G. Blaine the appointment of\r\n  senator in congress, he has placed in my hands his resignation as\r\n  representative from the third district of Maine, to take effect\r\n  Monday, July 10, 1876.\r\n\r\n                                             “SELDON CONNOR,\r\n                                                  “_Governor of Maine_.”\r\n\r\nWhen the legislature of his state met, he came before them and placed\r\nhimself under a thorough investigation at their hands. And as Ex-Gov.\r\nA. P. Morrill says, “They made thorough work of it.” A man to come\r\nforth from such an ordeal unscathed, and without the smell of fire on\r\nhis garments, must be right and not wrong,--or else he is the veriest\r\nscoundrel, guilty, deeply so, and competent for bribes, and they, the\r\nlegislature of Maine, who virtually tried him, hopelessly corrupt. But,\r\nno! this cannot be; and so he was vindicated, and triumphantly elected\r\nby them to the highest trust within their gift, to wear the honors of a\r\nMorrill and a Fessenden.\r\n\r\nAnd yet again do they elect him for a full term of years. And then the\r\nroyal Garfield, the nation’s loved and honored president, knowing all,\r\nand knowing him most intimately for seventeen years or more, takes him\r\ninto his cabinet, trustingly, and for the nation’s good.\r\n\r\nCan victory be grander, or triumph more complete, endorsement more\r\nhonorable, or vindication more just, or a verdict be more patient,\r\nthorough, or exhaustive of evidence! What man in all the land, traduced\r\nand vilified just as Washington, Lincoln, and Garfield were, wears\r\nprouder badges of endorsement from congress, governor, legislature,\r\nsenate, and conventions by the score! What man that bears credentials\r\nof his character as trophies of higher worth, from judges of sounder\r\nmind, and lives more unimpeachable? Answer, ye who can!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nXV.\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES SENATOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was generally understood in Maine that the Hon. Lot M. Morrill\r\nwas serving his last term in the United States senate, and that Mr.\r\nBlaine was to be his successor; so that when Mr. Morrill was advanced\r\nto the secretaryship of the treasury in General Grant’s cabinet, it\r\noccasioned no surprise that Governor Connor appointed Mr. Blaine to the\r\nsenate in his stead. He was just recovering from the partial sunstroke\r\nwhich felled him to the pavement while on his way to church, on a\r\nSabbath morning, with Miss Abigail Dodge (Gail Hamilton), just prior\r\nto the Cincinnati Convention, and soon after his victory over Proctor\r\nKnott, during his persecution in the House. Next to the nomination\r\nat Cincinnati, nothing of a political nature could have been more\r\ngrateful to him than this high honor from the governor of his state,\r\nin accordance, as the governor himself says, with the expectation of\r\nthe people. Coming, as it did, at an ill and weary time, it must have\r\ngreatly refreshed and revived his spirits, to have new and larger\r\nevidence of the esteem and endorsement of those to whose interests his\r\nlife was devoted.\r\n\r\nOn July 12, 1876, he took his seat as the colleague of Hannibal Hamlin\r\nin the senate. He is placed at once as chairman on the committee on\r\nrules, and on the committee on appropriations, and on naval affairs,\r\nbesides on a select committee “on the levees on the Mississippi River.”\r\nThis, for a senatorial start, was quite honorable to his judgment and\r\nability.\r\n\r\nThere are many old traditions and customs, which amount to laws, so far\r\nas assigning positions of responsibility to new members is concerned,\r\nbut there is no law which prevents a new member from taking the most\r\nadvanced position possible by virtue of his wisdom and knowledge, and\r\nhis ability in debate.\r\n\r\nHe could not well become entangled in the meshes of an intricate\r\nnetwork of rules and regulations, which Butler, in acknowledging Mr.\r\nBlaine’s superior knowledge of in the House, had said he knew nothing\r\nabout,--Blaine knew it all. His position made it necessary that he\r\nshould, and now he was made chief in this department in the new branch\r\nof legislation to which he had succeeded. So he could not be held or\r\nhampered by any difficulty of this kind. Moreover, his acquaintance\r\nwas well-nigh universal among the members, and some of them knew him a\r\nlittle better than they could have wished. He was also familiar with\r\nthe methods and measures of the senate, having frequently been on\r\njoint committees with them during his early terms of service in the\r\nlower House, and then the general subjects of appropriations, naval,\r\nmilitary, judiciary, manufactures, commerce, foreign affairs, finance,\r\npension affairs, etc., these were the subjects with which he was\r\naccustomed to deal during all of his years in congress.\r\n\r\nHe was at home, and coming into the senate on the wave of popular\r\nexcitement, which was of the same broad and sweeping character that\r\nsurrounded Henry Clay, and which came so near giving him the nomination\r\nfor the presidency then, he was not only at home in all his feelings\r\nof political association and public duty, but exceedingly prominent as\r\nwell,--the one man of worth above all others, though the last to enter\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nHe had no need to take front rank; he was there already, and gave\r\nhimself to his work, not as a defeated man,--they had played but one\r\ninning then,--but as a victor, enjoying his promotion well, from\r\nthe lower to the upper house of congress. He was nearing the goal,\r\ntaking the honors by the way, just as Garfield did, but unlike him,\r\ntarrying in the senate to enjoy them. It was a good place to be; grand\r\nenough to command the lives, in all their richness and maturity, of\r\nSumner, Webster, Choate, of Hamlin, Fessenden, and Clay, of Wilson,\r\nEdmunds, Dawes, and galaxies by the score, representing every state\r\nin the Union. Great lights from every department of life shone there:\r\nscholars, teachers, authors, successful generals; culture, refinement,\r\nand every excellence.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine brought with him from the House, his old spirit of freeness,\r\nand general adaptability and service. He had not come in to rest, be\r\nshelved, or fossilized. His old habit of thoroughness was on him still;\r\nhe was not the man to change at six and forty years of age. He must\r\nstill touch top, bottom, and sides of every question with which he\r\ndealt, and so he did.\r\n\r\nHe loved the truths of history, and took them whole, entire, lacking\r\nnothing, and not in a garbled form. This of course caused facts and\r\nfigures to strike with telling power upon many a man’s coat of mail, or\r\ncause the shield to tremble with the power of his stroke. But he was\r\nthere without apology, to do the strong, decisive work which marked the\r\nhistory of his life. He loved the state of his adoption, and the time\r\nhad come when the pride of her glory should appear.\r\n\r\nThe old House of Representatives had been devoted, as a gallery of art,\r\nto portraits and statues of the great men of the nation. Two were to be\r\nselected by each state from the record of their leading men.\r\n\r\nThe statue of William King, the first governor of Maine, in 1820 and\r\n1821, was presented with speeches in the senate by both Mr. Hamlin and\r\nMr. Blaine. In reciting briefly the history of Mr. King, Mr. Blaine\r\nrelied wholly upon Massachusetts authority, and he added, “To have\r\ngiven anything like a sketch of Governor King’s life without giving his\r\nconflict with Massachusetts, touching the separation of Maine and her\r\nerection into an independent state, would have been like writing the\r\nlife of Abraham Lincoln without mentioning the great Rebellion, which,\r\nas president of the United States, he was so largely instrumental in\r\nsuppressing.”\r\n\r\nThese words he uttered in vindication of himself from certain\r\nrestrictions placed upon him, and he closed by saying “that he notified\r\nthe senators from Massachusetts that he should feel compelled to\r\nnarrate those portions of Mr. King’s history that brought him in\r\nconflict with the parent state.”\r\n\r\nIn less than a month after the statue of Governor King was placed in\r\nthe national gallery, by a unanimous vote of the senate, Mr. Blaine\r\nwas before that body with a speech of his usual force and energy, upon\r\nthe absorbing question of hard money. The subject had been discussed\r\nin the House, and their action sent to the senate, and Mr. Blaine had\r\noffered a substitute for their bill, which contained three very simple\r\nprovisions, as he said, viz.:--\r\n\r\n1. “That the dollar shall contain four hundred and twenty-five grains\r\nof standard silver, shall have unlimited coinage, and be an unlimited\r\nlegal tender.\r\n\r\n2. “That all the profits of coinage shall go to the government, and not\r\nto the operator in silver bullion.\r\n\r\n3. “That silver dollars or silver bullion, assayed and mint-stamped,\r\nmay be deposited with the assistant treasurer at New York, for which\r\ncoin-certificates may be issued, the same in denomination as United\r\nStates notes, not below ten dollars, and that these shall be redeemable\r\non demand in coin or bullion, thus furnishing a paper-circulation based\r\non an actual deposit of precious metal, giving us notes as valuable as\r\nthose of the Bank of England and doing away at once with the dreaded\r\ninconvenience of silver on account of bulk and weight.”\r\n\r\nHe cites an exclusively gold nation like England, which, while it may\r\nhave some massive fortunes, shows also the most hopeless and helpless\r\npoverty in the humblest walks of life. But France, a gold-and-silver\r\nnation, while it can exhibit no such fortunes as England boasts,\r\npresents “a people who, with silver savings, can pay a war indemnity\r\nthat would have beggared the gold-bankers of London, and to which the\r\npeasantry of England could not have contributed a pound sterling in\r\ngold, nor a single shilling in silver.”\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine’s sense of justice, and national honor, and national\r\npride were injured by making a dollar which, in effect, was not a\r\ndollar,--was not worth a hundred cents.\r\n\r\n“Consider, further,” he says, “what injustice would be done to every\r\nholder of a legal-tender or national-bank note. That vast volume of\r\npaper-money--over seven hundred millions of dollars--is now worth\r\nbetween ninety-eight and ninety-nine cents on the dollar in gold coin.\r\nThe holders of it, who are indeed our entire population, from the\r\npoorest to the wealthiest, have been promised, from the hour of its\r\nissue, that the paper-money would one day be as good as gold. To pay\r\nsilver for the greenback is a full compliance with this promise and\r\nthis obligation, provided the silver is made as it always has been\r\nhitherto, as good as gold. To make our silver coin even three per cent.\r\nless valuable than gold, inflicts at once a loss of more than twenty\r\nmillions of dollars on the holders of our paper-money. To make a silver\r\ndollar worth but ninety-two cents, precipitates on the same class a\r\nloss of well-nigh sixty millions of dollars. For whatever the value of\r\nthe silver dollar is, the whole paper issue of the country will sink to\r\nits standard when its coinage is authorized and its circulation becomes\r\ngeneral in the channels of trade.\r\n\r\n“Some one in conversation with Commodore Vanderbilt during one of the\r\nmany freight competitions of the trunk lines, said, ‘Why, the Canadian\r\nroad has not sufficient carrying capacity to compete with your great\r\nline!’\r\n\r\n“‘That is true,’ replied the Commodore, ‘but they can fix a rate and\r\nforce us down to it.’\r\n\r\n“Were congress to pass a law to-day, declaring that every legal-tender\r\nnote and every national-bank note shall hereafter pass for only\r\nninety-six or ninety-seven cents on the dollar, there is not a\r\nconstituency in the United States that would re-elect a man that should\r\nsupport it, and in many districts the representative would be lucky if\r\nhe escaped with merely a minority vote.”\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine’s sympathies in this discussion were with the people, and\r\nalthough he had passed out of that popular branch of congress, as it is\r\ncalled, most nearly connected with them, he could not in any sense be\r\ndivorced from them, and so, although before men of great wealth, his\r\nplea was for the laboring class,--for those who made the country strong\r\nand rich,--and so in continuing his speech he pleaded for them; and it\r\nwill bring them nearer to him to-day to recall his strong and earnest\r\nwords, which, even in the staid and formal senate, with its infinite\r\ncourtesies and conservative venerations, has a heart to smile, and good\r\ncheer sufficient to applaud, as they did this close of his hard-money\r\nspeech. These were his final utterances:--\r\n\r\n“The effect of paying the labor of this country in silver coin of full\r\nvalue, as compared with irredeemable paper,--or as compared, even, with\r\nsilver of inferior value,--will make itself felt in a single generation\r\nto the extent of tens of millions--perhaps hundreds of millions--in\r\nthe aggregate savings which represent consolidated capital. It is the\r\ninstinct of man from the savage to the scholar--developed in childhood,\r\nand remaining with age--to value the metals which in all tongues are\r\ncalled precious.\r\n\r\n“Excessive paper-money leads to extravagance, to waste, and to want, as\r\nwe painfully witness on all sides to-day. And in the midst of the proof\r\nof its demoralizing and destructive effect, we hear it proclaimed in\r\nthe halls of congress, that ‘the people demand cheap money.’ I deny\r\nit. I declare such a phrase to be a total misapprehension--a total\r\nmisinterpretation of the popular wish. The people do not demand cheap\r\nmoney. They demand an abundance of good money, which is an entirely\r\ndifferent thing. They do not want a single gold standard that will\r\nexclude silver, and benefit those already rich. They do not want an\r\ninferior silver standard that will drive out gold, and not help those\r\nalready poor. They want both metals, in full value, in equal honor, in\r\nwhatever abundance the bountiful earth will yield them to the searching\r\neye of science, and to the hard hand of labor.\r\n\r\n“The two metals have existed side by side in harmonious, honorable\r\ncompanionship, as money, ever since intelligent trade was known among\r\nmen. It is well-nigh forty centuries since ‘Abraham weighed to Ephron\r\nthe silver which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth--four\r\nhundred shekels of silver--current money with the merchant.’ Since that\r\ntime nations have risen and fallen, races have disappeared, dialects\r\nand languages have been forgotten, arts have been lost, treasures\r\nhave perished, continents have been discovered, islands have been\r\nsunk in the sea, and through all these ages, and through all these\r\nchanges, silver and gold have reigned supreme as the representatives\r\nof value--as the media of exchange. The dethronement of each has been\r\nattempted in turn, and sometimes the dethronement of both; but always\r\nin vain! And we are here to-day, deliberating anew over the problem\r\nwhich comes down to us from Abraham’s time--_the weight of the silver_\r\nthat shall be ‘current money with the merchant.’”\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Blaine resumed his seat, it is said, in brackets, there was\r\nprotracted applause; and so much was there that the vice-president,\r\nWilliam A. Wheeler, of New York, felt compelled to say, “Order! The\r\nchair assuming that the galleries are ignorant of the laws of the\r\nsenate, gives notice that if applause is repeated they will be promptly\r\ncleared.”\r\n\r\nThis cannot fail to suggest the fact beyond a doubt, that he had lost\r\nnone of his old-time fervor, and that he proposed to allow no right of\r\nthe people to slip from them, so long as he held place and power in\r\ntheir interest, and had a voice to lift in their defence.\r\n\r\nThe great business of congress is done by committees, as is well known,\r\nand their reports are discussed, amended, and acted upon, endorsed or\r\nrejected.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine’s committee on appropriations was one of the most difficult.\r\nDemands are almost innumerable, and to act intelligently requires a\r\nlarge knowledge of every department of the government; of the military,\r\nthe great postal lines and offices, and the new ones being built,\r\ncustom-houses, forts, arsenals, navy-yards, etc.; and this work must be\r\ndone by the committees, working not early, but late.\r\n\r\nHe was specially fitted for the committee on naval affairs, as he had\r\ngone over the whole question of ship-building and shipping while in the\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nWe find him actuated by the same feelings of humanity and carefulness,\r\nas actuated him years before, but now more conspicuously, because in a\r\nlarger, loftier sphere.\r\n\r\nHe presents bills for the relief of the families of those who perished\r\non the United States dredge-boat “McAlister”; to enlarge the power\r\nand duties of the board of health in the District of Columbia; to\r\namend the Pacific Railroad act by creating a sinking-fund. He moved to\r\ninvestigate charges against Senator M. C. Butler, of South Carolina.\r\n\r\nWe find Mr. Blaine showing an appreciation for that old soldier of the\r\nRepublic, in the Mexican war and the war of the Rebellion, Hon. James\r\nShields, of Missouri, by presenting a bill to make him a major-general.\r\nGeneral Shields had a bullet through his body in Mexico, at Buena\r\nVista, and a silk handkerchief drawn through his body in the track of\r\nthe wound, and now he is honored as an old man; but he does not live\r\nlong to enjoy it. He was a hardy, heroic, faithful man and soldier, and\r\nworthy of the repeated honors conferred upon him by his state and by\r\nthe nation. It was a generous impulse of a kindly heart that prompted\r\nthis honor in the senate for the aged soldier.\r\n\r\nThe bureau of engraving and printing was remembered by him in a bill to\r\nprovide that department with a fire-proof building.\r\n\r\nWhen the bill was before the senate to pension the soldiers of the\r\nMexican war, Mr. Hoar offered a resolution by way of amendment:\r\n“Provided, further, that no pension shall ever be paid under this act\r\nto Jefferson Davis, the late president of the so-called Confederacy.”\r\nTwenty-two were found to vote against it. The discussion grew now\r\nalmost intolerable. Nearly every rebel sympathizer from the South\r\nspoke against it; among them were Garland, Bailey, Maxey, Thurman,\r\nGordon, Lamar, Morgan, Coke. Strong hearts were stirred against their\r\nutterances, and strong words uttered for the Union cause.\r\n\r\n“There is no parallel to the magnanimity of our government,” said\r\nMr. Blaine, in reply to Lamar’s charge of intolerance. “Not one\r\nsingle execution, not one single confiscation; at the outside only\r\nfourteen thousand out of millions put under disfranchisement, and\r\nall of them released, and all of them invited to come to the common\r\nboard, fraternally and patriotically, with the rest of us, and share a\r\ncommon destiny for weal or for woe in the future. I tell the honorable\r\ngentleman it does not become him, or any Southern man, to speak of\r\nintolerance on the part of the national government; rather, if he speak\r\nof it at all, he should allude to its magnanimity and its grandeur.”\r\n\r\nThe great boldness with which Mr. Blaine stood up against the\r\nusurpations of the solid South is a lasting honor to him. He desired\r\nto place on record, in a definite and authentic form, the frauds and\r\noutrages by which some recent elections were carried by the Democratic\r\nparty in the Southern states, and to find if there be any method\r\nto prevent a repetition of those crimes against a free ballot. One\r\nhundred and six representatives had been elected recently in the\r\nSouth, and only four or five of them Republicans, and thirty-five of\r\nthe whole number had been assigned to the South, he said, “by reason\r\nof the colored people.” In South Carolina, he speaks of “a series of\r\nskirmishes over the state, in which the polling places were regarded as\r\nforts, to be captured by one party and held against the other, so that\r\nthere was no election in any proper sense.” The information came from a\r\nnon-partisan press, and without contradiction so far as he had seen.\r\n\r\nThis was his resolution in the senate:--\r\n\r\n  “_Resolved_, That the committee on the judiciary be instructed to\r\n  inquire and report to the senate, whether at the recent elections\r\n  the constitutional rights of American citizens were violated in\r\n  any of the states of the Union; whether the right of suffrage of\r\n  citizens of the United States, or of any class of such citizens,\r\n  was denied or abridged by the action of the election-officers of\r\n  any state in refusing to receive their votes, in failing to count\r\n  them, or in receiving and counting fraudulent ballots in pursuance\r\n  of a conspiracy to make the lawful votes of such citizens of non\r\n  effect; and whether such citizens were prevented from exercising the\r\n  elective franchise, or forced to use it against their wishes, by\r\n  violence or threats, or hostile demonstrations of armed men or other\r\n  organizations, or by any other unlawful means or practices.\r\n\r\n  “_Resolved_, That the committee on the judiciary be further\r\n  instructed to inquire and report whether it is within the competency\r\n  of congress to provide by additional legislation for the more perfect\r\n  security of the right of suffrage to citizens of the United States in\r\n  all the states of the Union.\r\n\r\n  “_Resolved_, That in prosecuting these inquiries the judiciary\r\n  committee shall have the right to send for persons and papers.”\r\n\r\nThe negro had become practically disfranchised; the true end of the war\r\nin his rightful liberty as a freeman, in the full sense of the term,\r\nwas concerned; and the acts of government in making him a citizen,\r\nand his representation in congress according to the new allotment of\r\nthirty-five representatives for the colored population;--all these ends\r\nhad been subverted, these rights abrogated, and the constitution, in\r\nits most sacred and dearly-bought amendments, violently ignored, and\r\nmen were there with perjury on their lips and treason in their hearts,\r\nwho had countenanced and upheld all of this.\r\n\r\n“Let me illustrate,” Mr. Blaine says, “by comparing groups of states\r\nof the same representative strength North and South. Take the states\r\nof South Carolina, Mississippi, and Louisiana. They send seventeen\r\nrepresentatives to congress. Their aggregate population is composed\r\nof ten hundred and thirty-five thousand whites and twelve hundred and\r\ntwenty-four thousand colored; the colored being nearly two hundred\r\nthousand in excess of the whites. Of the seventeen representatives,\r\nthen, it is evident that nine were apportioned to these states by\r\nreason of their colored population, and only eight by reason of their\r\nwhite population; and yet in the choice of the entire seventeen\r\nrepresentatives, the colored voters had no more voice or power than\r\ntheir remote kindred on the shores of Senegambia or on the Gold Coast.\r\nThe ten hundred and thirty-five thousand white people had the sole and\r\nabsolute choice of the entire seventeen representatives.\r\n\r\n“In contrast, take two states in the North, Iowa and Wisconsin, with\r\nseventeen representatives. They have a white population of two million\r\ntwo hundred and forty-seven thousand,--considerably more than double\r\nthe entire white population of the three Southern states I have named.\r\nIn Iowa and Wisconsin, therefore, it takes one hundred and thirty-two\r\nthousand white population to send a representative to congress, but in\r\nSouth Carolina, Mississippi, and Louisiana every sixty thousand white\r\npeople send a representative. In other words, sixty thousand white\r\npeople in those Southern states have precisely the same political\r\npower in the government of the country that one hundred and thirty-two\r\nthousand white people have in Iowa and Wisconsin.”\r\n\r\nAnd it is because this state of things continues and has threatened\r\nevery presidential election since then, that the brave deed of standing\r\nin the presence of the perpetrators of the wrong, and unmasking its\r\nhideous mien, is still all the more worthy of notice, and demands an\r\nincreased interest; and so we venture to give another sample of his\r\nold Plutarch method of contrast and comparison; the last few sentences\r\nof the speech, constituting as they did his peroration, and being so\r\npointed, personal, and triumphant in tone and manner, revealing the\r\nman so clearly and forcibly, that we close our reference to the speech\r\nwith them, and giving a summary of argument and powerful, homeward\r\nputting of truth, worthy of the honor of the great cause he pleaded,\r\nworthy of the dignity of the high place in which he spoke, and worthy\r\nof himself:--\r\n\r\n“Within that entire great organization there is not one man, whose\r\nopinion is entitled to be quoted, that does not desire peace and\r\nharmony and friendship, and a patriotic and fraternal union, between\r\nthe North and the South. This wish is spontaneous, instinctive,\r\nuniversal throughout the Northern states; and yet, among men of\r\ncharacter and sense, there is surely no need of attempting to deceive\r\nourselves as to the precise truth. First pure, then peaceable. Gush\r\nwill not remove a grievance, and no disguise of state rights will close\r\nthe eyes of our people to the necessity of correcting a great national\r\nwrong. Nor should the South make the fatal mistake of concluding that\r\ninjustice to the negro is not also injustice to the white man; nor\r\nshould it ever be forgotten, that for the wrongs of both a remedy will\r\nassuredly be found.\r\n\r\n“The war, with all its costly sacrifices, was fought in vain unless\r\nequal rights for all classes be established in all the states of\r\nthe Union; and now, in words which are those of friendship, however\r\ndifferently they may be accepted, I tell the men of the South here on\r\nthis floor and beyond this chamber, that even if they could strip the\r\nnegro of his constitutional rights, they can never permanently maintain\r\nthe inequality of white men in this nation; they can never make a white\r\nman’s vote in the South doubly as powerful in the administration of the\r\ngovernment as a white man’s vote in the North.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nXVI.\r\n\r\nBLAINE AND GARFIELD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese names will be forever linked together in American history. Not\r\nas the names of Lincoln and Seward. They had little in common except\r\nmassive powers and a common work, without any special affinities\r\nor friendships other than of a public and political nature. They\r\nwere, indeed, friends in a large sense, and each worthy of the\r\nother, constituting largely the nation’s head, when the greatness of\r\nstatesmanship is head, and the loyalty of statesmanship is heart, was\r\nthe demand of the hour. It was the cause and circumstance that brought\r\ntheir great lives in unison. And yet we are not told that in any sense\r\nthey were like David and Jonathan,--one at heart in a personal love,\r\nas they were one in mind, devoted to the great concern of the nation’s\r\nperpetuity.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Garfield and Mr. Blaine, when young men far from their prime,\r\nentered together the thirty-eighth congress in 1863. Those were dark\r\ndays, and side by side they fought out in congress halls the great\r\nbattle for Liberty and Right against Slavery and Wrong. No contest\r\ncommanded talent of a higher order. No men supremer in those great\r\nqualities which give to greatness the sovereign right to dictate the\r\ndestiny of mighty interests, and crown, as personal achievements, those\r\ninterests with a glory imperishable,--none better, braver, truer, armed\r\nto the point of triumph, ever stood up against incarnate wrong, to\r\nwage the sharp, decisive engagement to final conquest, than did these\r\nmen and their noble compeers. They entered the lists when the breath\r\nof battle blew hottest, when the land was darkest with shadows of the\r\nwar-cloud, when the nation was saddest from loss of noble sons by\r\nland and sea, when desperation was stamped in the face of the foe and\r\nrankled in his heart. Like Spartans, there they stood, pouring their\r\nvital energies into the current of the nation’s life, until the end of\r\nwar, and all its fruits were gathered in and secured in safety within\r\nthe iron chest of the constitution’s sure protection.\r\n\r\nIt was not for four years, but for thirteen, that they thus held each\r\nother company in their high service of the nation and the world. Such\r\nfellowship as this, rich with every element of honor, could but weld\r\ntheir hearts in unity. As they grew up into those expansive lives,\r\nrare and fragrant with the choicest gifts of nature, and rich with\r\ndeeds worthy of the noblest powers, so that the highest honors of the\r\nnation seemed theirs, they grew not apart, but together. Thinking and\r\nspeaking, writing and contending, for the same great measures, their\r\nlives ran in the same great channels.\r\n\r\nThe friendship of soldiers who have toiled and endured together, is\r\nfelt by thousands in our Republic to-day, and the feeling grows deeper\r\nand stronger as the years go by. This is general, and is common to all,\r\nbut it is enduring and sincere. Yet there were special, particular\r\nfriendships, more personal in their nature, that sprang up like\r\nbeautiful plants, upon this larger field. These are not forgotten or\r\ndestroyed. The strength of life is in them, and the growth of years is\r\non them. The immortality of time is theirs. So in the narrower field,\r\nwhen the life-giving service of years, wrought into the structure of a\r\nnation redeemed, these men added to the charm and glory of the broader\r\nand more general interest, the grace of a special personal friendliness.\r\n\r\nThey were just dissimilar enough for this. They were both large, strong\r\nmen in physique, and yet not large and portly in the sense of large\r\nand needless bulk of flesh; but fine and strong frames, with massive\r\nheads set squarely upon broad shoulders; arms that swung with power;\r\nbodies filled with health,--not shrunken, dwarfed, or withered,--and\r\ngood, stout limbs, that held them well in air, and moved with speed of\r\nthe same strong will that commanded and controlled their utterance.\r\nThere were ease and grace in every motion. They stood erect and bore\r\nthemselves with the dignity of kings, and yet the merest child was\r\nbeloved by them. If the one was deeper and more metaphysical than the\r\nother, that other was broader, richer in generalization,--marshalling\r\nhis well-armed troops of knowledge from every field where Right had\r\nconquered Wrong, and moving his battalions with the speed of a swifter\r\nmarch. They were never left to be bitter contestants at any point;\r\nneither had ever plunged the iron into the soul of the other, or done\r\naught to hinder the cause of the other’s promotion.\r\n\r\nEarly in their congressional career they were both stamped as future\r\ncandidates for the presidency. They were so thought of and talked\r\nabout. But Mr. Blaine’s prominence as a speaker of the House of\r\nRepresentatives had given him earliest the greater prominence in this\r\ndirection, and from various quarters it was being thrust upon him.\r\nBut they were friends, and had no bickerings and jealousies on this\r\naccount. Garfield could wait, and would. He did not put himself\r\nforward, nor seek it at the hands of friends. He would rather bide his\r\ntime, and help another. But that other was not Mr. Blaine, though they\r\nwere friends. It was a matter of honor, of state-pride, and of duty,\r\nthat he gave his suffrage and his power to John Sherman, of his own\r\nstate of Ohio, who had done such magnificent service in the treasury in\r\npaying the national debt and resuming specie payment. And his great,\r\nhonest speech was so brilliant and earnest for his friend at home, that\r\nit turned the mind of the convention toward him.\r\n\r\nWhen the crisis came they crowned him, and on the instant the news was\r\nflashed into the presence of Mr. Blaine, while still the cheers went up\r\nin that great assembly in Chicago; he sent his congratulations to his\r\nfriend, and said, “Command my services for the great campaign.” They\r\nwere friends and brothers still, each worthy of the other’s highest\r\nhonor, truest devotion, and fullest praise. Political lying could not\r\nbefoul the heart of either with any member of that brood of vipers\r\nwhich inhabit this sphere in other breasts. They knew too well the\r\nnature and the tactics of the foe. I have seen a soldier dead upon the\r\nfield, so blackened with blood and powder from the fray, that three\r\nstood by and claimed him for their different companies, and none\r\nperchance were right.\r\n\r\nBut no blackening powder of the enemy, no mud of march, no dust of\r\ncamp, or any other creature, could so bespatter or besmear these men\r\nso they should fail to know and love each other. The battle had been\r\nlong and hard, and desperate to them. Neither could be pierced or\r\nfall without the other’s notice, and full well they knew that such\r\nhard pressure of the enemy would bring them to desperate straits. But\r\nthis did not cause them to fear or falter, but to rush on, through\r\nblinding and begriming powder-smoke, to victory. They could but smile\r\nat the enemies’ reports of battle, and of the skill and bearing of both\r\ngeneral and troops, just as when a paper crossed the lines in Rebellion\r\ntimes the truth came not always with it. Some one must bear the wrath\r\nof those whose flag was ever in the dust, and whose broken ranks were\r\nreeling in defeat. Hard names and lies were but the sparks,--the flint\r\nflash from the clash of arms,--they but consume themselves, then die\r\naway. No man, since all the hate of treason had blackened Lincoln and\r\nour leading men with crimes imaginary, had had his name politically\r\ntarnished with darker words of calumny than the wise, the good, the\r\nsainted Garfield; and yet Mr. Blaine lived so close to him, so well\r\nknew the health and the beauty of his inward life, the strength and\r\nsoundness of his character, the boldness of his purpose, purity of\r\nhis motive, and the cleanness of his record,--as history shall record\r\nit,--that his voice resounded as it never had done, from city to city,\r\nfrom state to state, in support of the man and in vindication of his\r\ncause; and the wreath was on his brow, and multitudes stood, with\r\nuncovered heads, to do him honor. His old, tried friends, who had\r\nwatched, and studied, and known him for twenty years had sent him back\r\nto congress for the ninth time. The legislature of Ohio had given him\r\ntheir suffrage and elevated him spontaneously, without his presence\r\nor his asking, to the senatorship. The convention had nominated, and\r\nthe people elected him to the presidency, and all despite the flinging\r\nof mud and the breath of slander. “He was met,” says Mr. Blaine,\r\n“with a storm of detraction at the very hour of his nomination, and\r\nit continued with increasing volume until the close of his victorious\r\ncampaign:--\r\n\r\n  “‘No might, nor greatness in mortality,\r\n  Can censure scope; back-wounding calumny.\r\n  The whitest virtue strikes; what king so strong,\r\n  Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue.’”\r\n\r\n“Under it all,” he says, “he was calm, and strong, and confident;\r\nnever lost his self-possession, did no unwise act, spoke no hasty\r\nor ill-considered word. Indeed, nothing in his whole life is more\r\nremarkable than his bearing through those five full months of\r\nvituperation. The great mass of these unjust imputations passed\r\nunnoticed, and with the general _débris_ of the campaign fell into\r\noblivion.”\r\n\r\nThe friendship of Mr. Blaine never waned. He was true as steel. And\r\nwhen the honors of the nation, who had honored him, were in Garfield’s\r\nhands, the chiefest and the best were for his first best friend, whom\r\nhe called to the highest place in his cabinet,--the _premier_ of the\r\nnation. This was no mere compliment. It was an official act. The\r\nsuccess of his administration, which was his greatest care, depended\r\nlargely upon his secretary of state. He must be clean as well as\r\ncompetent,--a king in skill and scholarship, as well as brother,\r\nfriend. It must then have been an act of his best judgment, as well\r\nas an expression of regard. And yet it was as well respect for the\r\nmillions, represented by the large and strong delegations who voted for\r\nhim with such strength of purpose for five-and-thirty times.\r\n\r\nFour months, less two days, he sat at his right hand in the highest\r\ncounsels of the country, a wise, and honored, and trusted man. He\r\ncould not have been there had not Garfield known him,--but he did\r\nknow him through and through, and because he knew him so thoroughly\r\nand well, he placed the keeping of the nation’s wisdom, integrity, and\r\nhonor before the world, and in the great world abroad, into his hands.\r\n\r\n“The heart is wiser than the head,” and knows more deeply into life and\r\ncharacter, than simple, abstract thought can penetrate. It receives\r\nand knows the whole man as a whole, knows him as a person in his every\r\nelement of personality in reason, conscience, affections, will; knows\r\nhim by the touch of moral reason, for pure intellect may act alone\r\ncomparatively in abstract questions, of metaphysical thought, but the\r\nheart never. The true enlightenment is here. It is the abode of motive,\r\npurpose, plan,--out of it are the issues of life itself.\r\n\r\nWe are ignorant of those we hate, as the South was of the North before\r\nthe war, and hence her braggart boasts. But those whom we know deeply,\r\nfully, truly, we love deeply, fully, truly. Love lights the path of\r\nreason, when it carries the whole reason with it, and furnishes by\r\nreciprocal acts of confidence data for its guidance. And thus we love\r\nour way into each other’s lives, while reason thus enlightened, helps\r\nus on.\r\n\r\nIt was thus with these great men of the nation’s hope, her honor, and\r\nher trust. They sat, they stood, they walked, they talked together,\r\ntheir great hearts open as the day, shining full upon each other. And\r\nas they shone thus on each other’s life, there was a blending, and so a\r\nmutual life, an interlacing, twining, locking, and so a unity.\r\n\r\nEvery walk in life furnishes its friendships; and the greater the\r\nwalk may be, the greater are the friendships; for the greater the\r\naffinities, the broader the sympathies, the purer, sweeter, more\r\nsupreme the life; for the true life is never isolated, but unstarved\r\nin every part. The king has his queen, the Czar his Czarina. Only the\r\nsmall-souled men are shrunken hearted, while large, capacious spirits\r\ntake in worlds.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the country never possessed two men at the same time who had\r\nmore friends of the solid and reliable sort than these men, who admired\r\nand loved to honor, and honored because they loved, and this because\r\nthey lived out their splendid natures before their countrymen, hating\r\nevery mean thing, loving and praising the good. They were not dark,\r\nunfathomable mysteries, enigmas, puzzles, problems, staring at you,\r\nunsolved, and daring you to the thankless task, and promising but the\r\ngloom of deeper shadows; you felt you knew them. They did not stand\r\naloof, daring you mount up to them, but coming down, they sat beside\r\nyou, and made you feel akin, and not blush out your feelings of a\r\ndoomed inferiority; and this great-heartedness, beating responsive to\r\nthe strong, warm touch of nature, made them friends.\r\n\r\nGarfield did not live to draw the picture of his Blaine, but Blaine has\r\nlived to draw the picture of his Garfield.\r\n\r\n“It is not easy,” he says, “to find his counterpart anywhere in the\r\nrecord of American public life. He, perhaps, more nearly resembles Mr.\r\nSeward in his supreme faith in the all-conquering power of a principle.\r\nHe had the love of learning, and patient industry of investigation to\r\nwhich John Quincy Adams owes his prominence, and his presidency. He\r\nhad some of those ponderous elements of mind which distinguished Mr.\r\nWebster, and which, indeed, in all our public life, have left the great\r\nMassachusetts senator without an intellectual peer.\r\n\r\n“Some of his methods recall the best features in the strong,\r\nindependent course of Sir Robert Peel, to whom he had striking\r\nresemblance in the type of his mind and the habit of his speech. He had\r\nall of Burke’s love for the sublime and the beautiful, with, possibly,\r\nsomething of his superabundance. In his faith and his magnanimity; in\r\nhis power of statement and subtle analysis; in his faultless logic,\r\nand his love of literature; in his wealth and mode of illustration, one\r\nis reminded of that great English statesman of to-day,--Gladstone.”\r\n\r\nBut the nation seems to commemorate most fittingly the friendship of\r\nthose two men, when in the person of its representatives and senators\r\nit selects to deliver the eulogy of the dead president. Not any of his\r\ncolleagues in the House from his native state, however long or well\r\nthey may have known him; nor his colleague in the senate; no governor\r\nof his honored state; his loved and cultured pastor, nor any other man\r\nthan Blaine,--his chosen counsellor in the great affairs of state;\r\nhe who was with him when, on that quiet, happy morning in July, they\r\nrode slowly to the depot, and “his fate was on him in an instant. One\r\nmoment he stood erect, strong, confident in the years stretching out\r\npeacefully before him;--the next he lay wounded, bleeding, helpless,\r\ndoomed to weary weeks of torture, to silence, and the grave.”\r\n\r\nAnd now, as the hand of Mr. Blaine draws aside the curtain, let us look\r\nin upon the final scene in the life and death of his great friend, and\r\nsee, as he saw, the man so deeply, truly loved by the great nation he\r\nhad just begun to rule so well.\r\n\r\n“Great in life, he was surpassingly great in death. For no cause,\r\nin the very frenzy of wantonness and wickedness, by the red hand of\r\nmurder, he was thrust from the full tide of this world’s interest; from\r\nits hopes, its aspirations, its victories, into the visible presence\r\nof death, and he did not quail. Not alone for the one short moment\r\nin which, stunned and dazed, he could give up life, hardly aware of\r\nits relinquishment; but through days of deadly languor; through weeks\r\nof agony, that was not less agony because silently borne; with clear\r\nsight and calm courage he looked into his open grave. What blight and\r\nruin met his anguished eyes, whose lips may tell? What brilliant,\r\nbroken plans; what baffled high ambitions; what sundering of strong,\r\nwarm manhood’s friendships; what bitter rending of sweet household\r\nties! Behind him a proud, expectant nation; a great host of sustaining\r\nfriends; a cherished and happy mother, wearing the full, rich honors\r\nof her early toil and tears; the wife of his youth, whose whole life\r\nlay in his; the little boys not yet emerged from childhood’s day of\r\nfrolic; the fair, young daughter; the sturdy sons, just springing into\r\nclosest companionship, claiming every day and every hour the reward of\r\na father’s love and care; and in his heart the eager, rejoicing power\r\nto meet all demands. Before him, desolation and great darkness! And his\r\nsoul was not shaken.\r\n\r\n“His countrymen were thrilled with instant, profound, and universal\r\nsympathy. Masterful in his mortal weakness, he became the centre of\r\na nation’s love; enshrined in the prayers of a world. But all the\r\nlove and all the sympathy could not share with him his suffering. He\r\ntrod the wine-press alone. With unfaltering front he faced death.\r\nWith unfailing tenderness he took leave of life. Above the demoniac\r\nhiss of the assassin’s bullet he heard the voice of God. With simple\r\nresignation he bowed to the divine decree.\r\n\r\n“As the end drew near, his early craving for the sea returned. The\r\nstately mansion of power had been to him the wearisome hospital of\r\npain, and he begged to be taken from its prison walls, from its\r\noppressive, stifling air, from its homelessness, and its hopelessness.\r\nGently, silently, the love of a great people bore the pale sufferer to\r\nthe longed-for healing of the sea, to live or to die, as God should\r\nwill, within sight of its heaving billows, within hearing of its\r\nmanifold voices. With wan, fevered face tenderly lifted to the cooling\r\nbreeze, he looked out wistfully upon the ocean’s changing wonders; on\r\nits far sails, whitening in the morning light; on its restless waves,\r\nrolling shoreward to break and die beneath the noonday sun; on the\r\nred clouds of evening, arching low to the horizon; on the serene and\r\nshining pathway of the stars. Let us believe that in the silence of the\r\nreceding world he heard the great waves breaking on a further shore,\r\nand felt, already upon his wasted brow, the breath of the eternal\r\nmorning.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nXVII.\r\n\r\nSECRETARY OF STATE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine was a member of the cabinets of President Garfield and\r\nof President Arthur for ten months, retiring at his own request, in\r\nJanuary, 1881.\r\n\r\nThe Foreign Policy of the Garfield administration, as conducted by Mr.\r\nBlaine, was emphatically a Peace Policy. It was without the motive or\r\ndisposition of war in any form. It was one of dignity and uprightness,\r\nas a work of twelve hundred and fifty pages, entitled “Foreign\r\nRelations of the United States for 1881,” and another book entitled\r\n“War in South America, and attempt to bring about Peace, 1880-81,” a\r\nbook of about eight hundred pages, both printed by the United States\r\nGovernment, and now before us, amply testify.\r\n\r\nIts two objects, as distinctly stated by him, were: first, to bring\r\nabout peace, and prevent future wars in North and South America;\r\nsecond, to cultivate such friendly commercial relations with all\r\nAmerican countries as would increase the export trade of the United\r\nStates, by supplying those fabrics in which we are abundantly able to\r\ncompete with the manufacturing nations of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe second depended on the first. For three years Chili, Peru, and\r\nBolivia had been engrossed in war, and the friendly offices of the\r\nUnited States Government had barely averted it between Chili and the\r\nArgentine Republic, postponed it between Guatemala and Mexico; so also\r\nit might in these South American Republics. War was threatened between\r\nBrazil and Uruguay, and foreshadowed between Brazil and the Argentine\r\nstates.\r\n\r\nTo induce the Spanish American states to adopt some peaceful mode of\r\nadjusting their frequently recurring contentions, was regarded by\r\nPresident Garfield as one of the most honorable and useful ends to\r\nwhich the diplomacy of the United States could contribute; and in the\r\nline of the policy indicated, is a letter from Mr. Blaine to Gen. S. A.\r\nHurlbut, United States Minister to Peru. While it shows the spirit of\r\nthe president, it shows as well the hand and heart of his secretary:--\r\n\r\n                                      “DEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n                                             “WASHINGTON, June 15, 1881.\r\n\r\n  “SIR:--The deplorable condition of Peru, the disorganization of its\r\n  government, and the absence of precise and trustworthy information\r\n  as to the state of affairs now existing in that unhappy country,\r\n  render it impossible to give you instructions as full and definite as\r\n  I would desire.\r\n\r\n  “Judging from the most recent despatches from our ministers, you will\r\n  probably find on the part of the Chilian authorities in possession\r\n  of Peru, a willingness to facilitate the establishment of the\r\n  provisional government which has been attempted by Senor Calderon.\r\n  If so you will do all you properly can to encourage the Peruvians\r\n  to accept any reasonable conditions and limitations with which this\r\n  concession may be accompanied. It is vitally important to Peru,\r\n  that she be allowed to resume the functions of a native and orderly\r\n  government, both for the purposes of internal administration and the\r\n  negotiation of peace. To obtain this end it would be far better to\r\n  accept conditions which may be hard and unwelcome, than by demanding\r\n  too much to force the continuance of the military control of Chili.\r\n  It is hoped that you will be able, in your necessary association\r\n  with the Chilian authorities, to impress upon them that the more\r\n  liberal and considerate their policy, the surer it will be to obtain\r\n  a lasting and satisfactory settlement. The Peruvians cannot but be\r\n  aware of the sympathy and interest of the people and government of\r\n  the United States, and will, I feel confident, be prepared to give to\r\n  your representations the consideration to which the friendly anxiety\r\n  of this government entitles them.\r\n\r\n  “The United States cannot refuse to recognize the rights which the\r\n  Chilian government has acquired by the successes of the war, and it\r\n  may be that a cession of territory will be the necessary price to be\r\n  paid for peace....\r\n\r\n  “As a strictly confidential communication, I inclose you a copy of\r\n  instructions sent this day to the United States minister at Santiago.\r\n  You will thus be advised of the position which this government\r\n  assumes toward all the parties to this deplorable conflict. It is\r\n  the desire of the United States to act in a spirit of the sincerest\r\n  friendship to the three republics, and to use its influence solely in\r\n  the interest of an honorable and lasting peace.\r\n\r\n                                                      “JAMES G. BLAINE.”\r\n\r\nThe appointment of William Henry Trescot as Spanish envoy, with the\r\nrank of Minister Plenipotentiary to the republics of Chili, Peru,\r\nand Bolivia, was done in the same regard, not only of the nation’s\r\nhonor, but also of peace and that commerce which brings prosperity and\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nIt has long been felt, and is felt deeply to-day, that there are many\r\nkindly offices of state which this great nation may offer to weaker,\r\nfeebler, and distressed peoples, for their good and for our glory;\r\nthat it is not enough to be simply an example and an asylum, but to\r\nbe a potent benefactor in a direct and personal way, teaching them\r\nthat peace, not war, is the secret of growth and greatness. This, in\r\neffect, was the object of the peace congress, which was a cherished\r\ndesign of the administration, and to which Mr. Blaine was fully\r\ncommitted.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that such a project commanded the thought and enlisted the\r\nsympathies of such men as Garfield and his great _premier_; and Mr.\r\nBlaine tells us that it was the intention, resolved on before the fatal\r\nshot of July 2d, to invite all the independent governments of North\r\nand South America to meet in such a congress at Washington, on March\r\n15, 1882, and the invitations would have been issued directly after\r\nthe New England tour the president was not permitted to make. But the\r\ninvitations were sent out by Mr. Blaine on the 22d of November, when in\r\nMr. Arthur’s cabinet. It met with cordial approval in South American\r\ncountries, and some of them at once accepted the invitations. But in\r\nsix weeks President Arthur caused the invitations to be recalled, or\r\nsuspended, and referred the whole matter to congress, where it was lost\r\nin debate, just as the Panama congress was wrecked when Mr. Clay was\r\nsecretary of state over fifty years ago.\r\n\r\nIt was argued that such an assemblage of representatives from those\r\nvarious states would not only elevate their standard of civilization,\r\nand lead to the fuller development of a continent at whose wealth\r\nHumboldt was amazed, but it would also bring them nearer us and turn\r\nthe drift of their European trade to our American shores. As it is,\r\nthey have a coin balance of trade against us every year, of one hundred\r\nand twenty millions of dollars, and this money is shipped from our\r\ncountry to Europe, to pay for their immense purchases there. Their\r\npetroleum comes from us, but crosses the Atlantic twice before it gets\r\nto them, and the middle-men in Europe receive a larger profit on it\r\nthan the producers of the oil in north-western Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nIt may be both wise and prudent, in order to completeness of biography,\r\nto state two aspersions,--one of war, and the other of gain,--cast upon\r\nthe policy of Mr. Blaine.\r\n\r\nWilliam Henry Trescot, in a published letter dated July 17, 1882,\r\nstates “his knowledge of certain matters connected with Mr. Blaine’s\r\nadministration as secretary of state”:--\r\n\r\n“2. As to your designing a war, that supposition is too absurd for\r\nserious consideration. If you had any such purpose it was carefully\r\nconcealed from me, and I left for South America with the impression\r\nthat I would utterly fail in my mission if I did not succeed in\r\nobtaining an _amicable settlement of the differences_ between the\r\nbelligerents.\r\n\r\n“3. In regard to the Cochet and Landreau claims, it is sufficient to\r\nsay that you rejected the first, absolutely. As to the second, you\r\ninstructed General Hurlbut to ask, if the proper time for such request\r\nshould come, that Landreau might be heard before a Peruvian tribunal in\r\nsupport of his claim.\r\n\r\n“General Hurlbut, although approving the justice of Landreau’s claim\r\nin his dispatch of Sept. 14, 1881, never brought it in any way to\r\nthe notice of the Peruvian government. During my mission in South\r\nAmerica, I never referred to it, so that, in point of fact, during\r\nyour secretaryship the Landreau claim was never mentioned by ministers\r\nof the United States, either to the Chilian or Peruvian government.\r\nIt could not, therefore, have affected the then pending diplomatic\r\nquestions in the remotest degree.”\r\n\r\nBut for these he appeared and answered, in company with Mr. Trescot,\r\nbefore the House committee on foreign affairs, Hon. Charles G.\r\nWilliams, of Wisconsin, chairman.\r\n\r\n“He received a vindication,” is the simple report.\r\n\r\n“I think Mr. Blaine has rather enjoyed his opportunity, and his\r\ntriumph,” writes one. “It is inspiring to have Mr. Blaine associated\r\nwith public affairs again, if only as a witness before a committee. How\r\nthe country rings with his name, the moment he breaks silence! His\r\nfamiliar face, framed in rapidly whitening hair; his elastic figure,\r\ngrowing almost venerable, from recent associations; his paternal manner\r\ntoward young Jimmie, his name-sake son, whom by some whim of fancy,\r\nhe had with him during the examination,--all these were elements of\r\ninterest in the picture.”\r\n\r\nAnd now comes a beautiful prophecy, two years old, which shows how\r\none may argue his way into the future by the hard and certain logic\r\nof events. It is this: “The administration will have to do something\r\nthat shall appeal strongly to the popular heart; something out of the\r\nline of hospitalities within its own charmed circle; something magnetic\r\nand heroic, or else ‘Blaine, of Maine,’ will become so idolized in the\r\nminds of the people that he will be invincible in 1884.”\r\n\r\nIn all of his foreign correspondence there is, in one particular, a\r\nstriking likeness between Mr. Blaine and President Lincoln,--the man is\r\nnot lost in the statesman, but rather the man is the statesman.\r\n\r\nAs Abraham Lincoln in all his giant form appears upon the forefront of\r\nevery public document that came from his hand, so James G. Blaine is\r\nphotographed from life in every state-paper that bears his name. He\r\ncopies no model, he stands on no pedestal,--his personality is free\r\nand untrammeled in every utterance.\r\n\r\nIn his paper to Mr. Lowell, our Minister to England, of Nov. 29, 1881,\r\nwe get a full view of the man at his work.\r\n\r\nA modification of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty of April 19, 1850, is the\r\nsubject in hand. His instructions had been sent ten days before. A week\r\nafterwards the response of Lord Granville to his circular note of June\r\n24, in relation to the neutrality of any canal across the Isthmus of\r\nPanama, had been received.\r\n\r\nAnd so he proceeded to give a summary of the historical objections\r\nto the Clayton-Bulwer treaty, and the very decided differences of\r\nopinion between the two governments, to which its interpretation has\r\ngiven rise. And this he does with singular skill and aptness, which is\r\nnot unusual to him, when the philosophy of history is needful as the\r\nservant of his genius.\r\n\r\nNo less than sixteen direct quotations of from two to eight lines each,\r\nare given in a letter of six large pages, taken from the discussion of\r\nthe subject for thirty years, while the main body of the letter, in its\r\nvarious parts, shows a comprehensive grasp of details, a familiarity\r\nwith utterances of the leading men of the past, and with England’s\r\noperations under the treaty, as to prove conclusively that in the\r\nhighest realms of statesmanship, mastery is still the one word that\r\ndefines the man.\r\n\r\nHis previous letter of instructions, presenting an analysis of the\r\nClayton-Bulwer treaty, singling out the objectionable features to be\r\nabrogated, and stating his reasons, is of the same clear, strong type,\r\ncompactly written, and applying the great arguments of common sense to\r\na subject of international importance.\r\n\r\n“The convention,” he says, “was made more than thirty years ago, under\r\nexceptional and extraordinary conditions, which have long since ceased\r\nto exist,--conditions which at best were temporary in their nature, and\r\nwhich can never be reproduced.\r\n\r\n“The development of the Pacific coast places responsibility upon\r\nour government which it cannot meet, and not control the canal now\r\nbuilding, and just as England controls the Suez canal.\r\n\r\n“England requires and sustains an immense navy, for which we have no\r\nuse, and might at any time seize the canal, and make it impossible for\r\nus to marshal a squadron in Pacific waters, without a perilous voyage\r\nourselves around the Horn.”\r\n\r\nGreat events of permanent importance would doubtless have been the\r\nresult, had the president and his secretary been permitted to continue\r\nas they were for the full term of office. Already Mr. Blaine was\r\nshowing himself a master in the arts of diplomacy, not with aught of\r\ncunning artifice or sly interrogation, but with straight-forward, solid\r\nutterances upon the great interests of the nation’s weal. Not only of\r\nthe loved and honored president did the assassin’s bullet deprive us,\r\nbut also of the services of Mr. Blaine, as well. A Providence more kind\r\nseems to be giving him back to the nation, to complete their unfinished\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nXVIII.\r\n\r\nHOME LIFE OF MR. BLAINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his “Letters to the Joneses” J. G. Holland describes various homes\r\nas possessing all the elements of an empire, a kingdom, a monarchy, or\r\na republic. Mr. Blaine’s home is a republic. Every member of his family\r\nseems to be on an absolute equality; and he, as one, has described him,\r\nand an intimate friend confirmed it, is more like a big brother than\r\naught beside. Certainly he is no emperor, no monarch, czar, or king. He\r\nis not even president or governor, nor chieftain there, or general; but\r\nrather the senior member of the family, the head by right of priority.\r\nHe is there deeply loved, greatly respected, and highly honored. Why\r\nneed he be a tyrant where a father’s wisdom and a father’s love will\r\nserve him best and win high encomiums of praise? Why not shine on when\r\nhe enters there, as well as in the places of the state and nation, or\r\nin the simpler walks and haunts of men? Why put out his light when\r\namong those who most admire and love? Why ring down the curtain upon\r\nall those splendid qualities of soul that make him famous in the world\r\nabroad, when in the charmed circle of those who love and share his fame\r\nand honor?\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine’s first home in Augusta was the eastern half of a large,\r\nbrown, double house, on Green Street, nearly opposite the Methodist\r\nchurch. It was a simple, unpretentious, pleasant home, all through\r\nhis editorial, legislative, and on into his congressional life. It\r\nwas where he did the hard work of those first years, where he made\r\nhis friends and bound them to him, where he entertained them and gave\r\nthem cheer. His business was a constant thing with him; he never quit\r\nor laid it aside; and it was a great part of his business to get\r\nacquainted. He took them to his home; it was open to all, and there\r\nwas a seat for any and all at his table. He kept open house the year\r\naround. When friends came it was hard to get away; he would hold on\r\nto them as he would to a book. He loved the people; they were a study\r\nto him; a very joy and pleasure, a real delight. Among the people he\r\nis perfectly at home, and they are made to feel that “come and see\r\nme” means just that, and all that that means. He is like a father or\r\nbig brother out among them. They all knew him, and knew where he\r\nlived,--in that “brown house on Green Street.” This was back in those\r\nyears before he was so largely in Washington, and before he had his\r\npleasant and more commodious house and grounds near the capitol.\r\n\r\nThe whole care of the home was upon Mrs. Blaine, who looked after\r\neverything down to the veriest _minutiæ_. She was thoroughly in\r\nsympathy with him, was pleased with what he enjoyed; and so was\r\nperfectly willing their home should be the rallying-place for his hosts\r\nof friends, who might come and go at will. The Maine legislature met at\r\nhis house during the Garcelon trouble.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine attended strictly to his work, and that meant the\r\npeople,--strangers, and townspeople, one and all. He never, I am\r\ncredibly informed, bought a pound of steak in his life, nor a barrel\r\nof flour; never went to a grocery store to buy anything. He has had\r\nno time or thought for things like these. He has been a student and\r\nteacher all his life; a close, deep, careful reader and thinker. He had\r\nnever been in a printing-office in his life until he became editor, and\r\nhad to learn the people, study them, get politics from their ways of\r\nthinking and looking at things; and it was a matter of principle with\r\nhim to make the thing go. It is not a half-dozen things, but “This one\r\nthing I do,” with him, and he does it. But he has always been regular\r\nat his meals, as a matter of health, and so a law of life. He was no\r\nepicurean; cared only for the more substantial things of diet, and\r\nnever seemed to be particular about what he ate, except one thing, and\r\nthat he liked, and always wanted them in their season, and always had\r\nthem. It was baked sweet apples and milk at the close of every meal.\r\nAnd then he would sit and read, and read, and read, especially after\r\nsupper, and Mrs. Blaine, if she wanted him to move from the table,\r\nwould say, “James! James!” and again, “James!” like enough half a dozen\r\ntimes before he would hear, and she pleasant and careful of him all\r\nthe time. She has had mind and heart to know his worth, and has needed\r\nno one to tell her that teaching school in Kentucky has paid her a\r\nhandsome dividend and is full of promise for the future. He has made no\r\nmove but what she has seconded the motion. Her life is in his, and not\r\na thing independent and apart from it.\r\n\r\nOne who knew her well in those early years, and knows her well to-day,\r\nsaid of Mrs. Blaine, “She is just as lovely as she can be; of superior\r\nculture, and a real, true mother.”\r\n\r\nThe gentleman who was Mr. Blaine’s foreman, and for a year and a\r\nhalf made his home with them, is most enthusiastic in their praise.\r\nHe tells what a real mother Mrs. Blaine was to him if he was sick, or\r\nanything the matter with him, how she would take the best of care of\r\nhim. Every winter they published a tri-weekly during the session of the\r\nlegislature, and this kept him at the office late every-other night,\r\nand she would be “worried about him because he had to work nights,” and\r\nMr. Blaine would say, “Howard, you are worth a dozen boys (shiftless,\r\ngood-for-nothing boys, he meant), but you must not work so hard.” The\r\nhumanities of life were the amenities to them.\r\n\r\nThis same man, who has since been editor and proprietor of Mr. Blaine’s\r\nold paper, said with depth of feeling, and strong emphasis, “I wish\r\nevery voter in America had had my opportunity for eighteen months,\r\nright in his own home, to see and know Mr. Blaine, they would find out\r\nthen what a royal man he is.”\r\n\r\nIn less than ten days after his nomination, parties of prominence,\r\nconnected with a paper favorable to his election, but located in quite\r\na city where a leading Republican paper affects to oppose him, visited\r\nAugusta, and called upon his political enemies, and enquired into his\r\nprivate, social, and domestic life, and they finally confessed there\r\nwas no lisp or syllable of aught to tarnish his name or cause a blush.\r\nIt is all pure, and sweet, and clear.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. and Mrs. Blaine first entered their Augusta home, a bright and\r\nbeautiful baby boy was in the arms of Mrs. Blaine. He was the pride and\r\njoy of the home, their first-born. His name was Stanwood Blaine, taking\r\nhis mother’s maiden-name. One short, bright year of sunshine, and\r\nprattle, and glee, and a dark cloud rested on that home; a deep sorrow\r\nstung the life of that father, and heavy grief oppressed the heart of\r\nthe mother,--their little Stanwood was gone; he was among the jewels on\r\nhigh, and there he is to-day, while a lovely picture of him adorns the\r\npresent home.\r\n\r\nSince then, six children have been born to them,--John Walker, a\r\ngraduate of Yale college, and a member of the Alabama Court of Claims;\r\nRobert Emmons, a graduate of Harvard college, now connected with\r\nthe North-western Railroad, in Chicago; Alice, the wife of Colonel\r\nCoppinger; Margaret; James Gillespie, Jr., and Hattie, named for her\r\nmother, Harriet. Walker, the oldest, is about thirty-one years old,\r\nand unmarried. Hattie, the youngest, is fourteen years of age. All\r\nof the children have been born in Augusta, and with but two or three\r\nexceptions, in the old home on Green Street.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine has been accustomed to sit up quite late at night with\r\nbooks, papers, and letters, and make up his sleep in the morning. He\r\nloves a good story, and keeps a fund on hand constantly, and they serve\r\nhis purpose well. There is one he has enjoyed telling to knots of\r\nfriends here and there, and especially when friends have gathered at\r\nhis table. The Maine law, in the interest of temperance, was a leading\r\nissue in the state during Mr. Blaine’s connection with the _Journal_.\r\nIt fell to the lot of his partner, John L. Stevens, who had been a\r\nminister, to write the temperance articles, and he would write them\r\nlong and strong. It was a custom with Mr. Blaine to go around among\r\nthe workmen and chat with them, a few words of good cheer. Among them\r\nwas an Irishman named John Murphy, who loved his glass. He was a witty\r\nfellow, and generally had something to say. One day while Mr. Blaine\r\nwas around, Murphy had a large, long manuscript from Mr. Stevens, on\r\ntemperance, which he was setting up in type. It was a hard job, and\r\nthe day was hot. He was about half through, when he called out to the\r\nforeman,--\r\n\r\n“Owen, have you a quarter?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir! What do you want of it?”\r\n\r\nAll were listening, including Mr. Blaine, for they expected something\r\nbright and sharp.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir, I thought I would have to be after having something to wet\r\nme throat wid before I got through with this long, dry temperance job.”\r\n\r\nEverybody roared at the Irishman’s quaint sally. It struck Mr. Blaine\r\nas particularly dry and ludicrous; he laughed outright, and he would\r\ntell it as a good joke on his partner.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine has never talked about people behind their backs; he is\r\nno gossiper. He is a fearless man, and if he has anything to say to\r\na man he says it squarely to his face. There is a purity of tone and\r\nrichness of life in his home, that are both noticeable and remarkable.\r\nThere seem to be no frictions, gratings, or harshness. One of ample\r\nopportunity has said, “I never heard him speak a cross word to his\r\nchildren.” He is rather indulgent than otherwise. While he may be, as\r\ncase requires, the strong, central government, they are as sovereign\r\nstates; no rebellion manifests itself, requiring coercion.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine’s family have been accustomed to attend church, and the\r\nfamily pew is always full. Father and mother are both members of\r\nthe Congregational Church, and have the reputation of being devoted\r\nChristians and liberal supporters of the church. Mr. Blaine tells them\r\nto put down what they want from him, and he will pay it.\r\n\r\nHe has the reputation of being one of the best Bible-class teachers\r\nin the city. His long drill at college, reading the New Testament\r\nthrough in Greek several times, has helped him in this. A Mission\r\nSabbath-school was started down in the lower part of Augusta, and he\r\nwent down with the others and taught a large Bible-class. His old\r\npastors, Doctor Ecob, of Albany, N. Y., and Doctor Webb, of Boston,\r\nMass., bear the highest testimony to his Christian character and\r\nintegrity. It was said of him at Cincinnati, that “he needed no\r\ncertificate of moral character from a Rebel congress,” and a very\r\ncareful examination proves it true. No man could, it would seem, by\r\nany possibility, stand better in his own home community than does Mr.\r\nBlaine. It is not simply cold, formal endorsement, as a matter of\r\nself-respect and state-pride, but the clear, strong words of a deep and\r\npowerful friendship, that one constantly hears who will stand in the\r\nlight and let it shine on him.\r\n\r\nThere were in his Green-street home, parlor, sitting-room, dining-room,\r\nand kitchen, down-stairs, and corresponding rooms up-stairs. There\r\nwas quite a large side-yard, with numerous trees, and garden in the\r\nrear. The barn and rear part of the house were connected by a long\r\nwood-house, as is the custom in New England. It was an ample and\r\nrespectable place for a young editor and politician to reside, and\r\nwhile it was up on the hill or low bluff from Water Street, down near\r\nthe Kennebec River, where the business portion of the city was, and his\r\noffice was located, still it was quite convenient for him.\r\n\r\nHis old office was burned in the big fire of 1865, which destroyed\r\nthe business portion of the city, but the desk was saved at which he\r\ndid much of his writing when in charge of the office of the _Journal_\r\nduring the presidential campaign of 1860.\r\n\r\nDuring this campaign there was so much to excite him, so much news to\r\nread, so many speeches to make, so many ways to go, and such a general\r\nmonopoly of time and attention, that very early in the morning they\r\nwould get out of “copy.” The foreman would say,--and he was a very\r\nkind-hearted man, and loved Mr. Blaine,--\r\n\r\n“I don’t see any way for you to do, Dan, but to go up to Mr. Blaine’s,\r\nand wake him up, and tell him we must have some more copy.”\r\n\r\nUp he would go to the Green-street home, and rouse him up. Mr. Blaine\r\nwould come down in his study-gown and slippers and say,--\r\n\r\n“What, that copy given out?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, and we will have to have more right away!”\r\n\r\n“Well, what did he do, sit right down and dash it off for you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sometimes, and sometimes he would take the scissors.”\r\n\r\nThis was said with a mild, significant smile.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine could write anywhere, and did much of it out in the\r\ndining-room on the supper-table, with his family all about him. He\r\nwould become oblivious of all surroundings, and with his power of\r\npenetration and concentration, adapt himself to his work, utterly lost\r\nto circumstances.\r\n\r\nHe had no mercy on meanness. It roused his whole nature. He would walk\r\nthe floor at home, plan his articles, think out his sentences, and\r\nsend everything to the printer just as he had written it first,--but\r\nwhen he came to correct the proof he would erase and interline until\r\nthe article had passed almost beyond the power of recognition. His\r\nfinishing touches were a new creation.\r\n\r\nOf course the poor printers never said anything either solemn or\r\nwise at such times, especially when driven to the final point of\r\ndesperation. But they could not get mad at him, and there was no use\r\ntrying. Dan said,--\r\n\r\n“He would just as soon shake hands with a man dressed up as I am now,\r\nwith this old suit of overalls on, and sit down and talk with him as\r\nwith the richest man in town.”\r\n\r\n“The men knew this, and saw and felt his power. He looked at the man,\r\nand not at the clothes?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that is just it.”\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine’s business and home-life are so blended, it is impossible\r\nto separate them. He never left his business at the office. It was all\r\nhours and every hour with him, except upon the Sabbath.\r\n\r\nHe took some time to look after the education of his children,\r\nsomething as his father and grandfather had dealt with him. But Mrs.\r\nBlaine, having been a teacher, took this responsibility upon herself.\r\nThey all attended the public schools of the city, and were early sent\r\naway to academy, college, and seminary. The home always had an air\r\nof intelligence. Busy scenes with books were common, day and night.\r\nMaterials for writing, papers, magazines, and books for general\r\nreading, and for review, seemed omnipresent. There is order and system\r\namid all the seeming confusion.\r\n\r\nMrs. Blaine’s hand and touch are felt and seen everywhere. She is a\r\nlarge, magnificent woman, a born queen, as fit to rule America as Queen\r\nVictoria to rule England. She has a quiet, commanding air, with nothing\r\nassumed or affected about her. A gentle, wholesome dignity makes her a\r\nstranger to storms, and her clear, strong mind makes her ready and at\r\nhome in society. She is not a great talker, and encourages it in others\r\nby listening only when it is sensible. She is too wise and womanly\r\nto ever gush, and never encourages talk about her husband. There is\r\nnothing patronizing about her.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, the presidency, since the death of Mr. Garfield, and the\r\nterrible ordeal through which they then passed, has been very serious\r\nbusiness to them. They have not labored for it. It has been thrust upon\r\nthem,--for they are one in every sympathy and every joy.\r\n\r\nAbout a year ago, while calling upon his old friend, Ex-Gov. Anson P.\r\nMorrill, Mr. Morrill said,--\r\n\r\n“Are you going to try for the presidency again, Blaine? Come, now, tell\r\nme, right out. I want to know.”\r\n\r\n“No, sir,” was the reply. “I do not want it. If you could offer it to\r\nme to-night, I would not accept it. I am devoted to my book at present,\r\nand love it, and do not wish to be diverted from it.”\r\n\r\nMr. Morrill went on to say, that “eight years ago, when they tried to\r\nnominate him at Cincinnati, I was opposed to it, and told my neighbor,\r\nMr. Stevens, I would not vote for him. I thought he was too young, and\r\nhad not grown enough.”\r\n\r\n“Well, how is it now?”\r\n\r\n“O, he is all right now, well-developed, solid, and strong. The nation\r\ncan’t do better than put him right in. He will make a master president,\r\nand give the country an administration they will be proud of.”\r\n\r\nThis shows the honor and honesty of the old governor, and that he loved\r\nthe nation above his friend. The happy, blessed, prosperous years of\r\nhome-life ended on Green Street, when Mr. Blaine was advanced to the\r\nthird office in the nation, as speaker of the House of Representatives\r\nin congress,--and they removed to the larger home, with ampler grounds,\r\non State Street, next to the capitol. Here they have since resided,\r\nexcept when living in Washington. Mr. Blaine loves home, and has his\r\nfamily with him.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing extravagant about the home on State Street, either\r\nin the house or its furnishing. It is plain, simple, and comfortable.\r\nThe sitting-room and dining-room upon the right of the main hall, and\r\nthe two parlors on the left are thrown into one, making two large\r\nrooms, which have always been serviceable for entertaining company,\r\nbut never more so than since his nomination for the presidency. The\r\nhallway extends into a large, new house, more modern in appearance than\r\nthe house proper, erected by Mr. Blaine for his library, gymnasium,\r\netc. Mr. Blaine is careful about his exercise, and practises with\r\ndumb-bells, takes walks, rides, etc.\r\n\r\nHe has a large barn for horses, and generally keeps a number of them.\r\nThe house is of Corinthian architecture, without a trace of Gothic.\r\nCorinthian columns, two on each side, indicate the old division of the\r\nlarge room on the left of the hallway into the front and back parlor,\r\nbut all trace of doors is removed, and they are practically one. A\r\nlarge bay-window, almost a conservatory, built square, in keeping with\r\nthe house, looks out upon the lawn.\r\n\r\nIt is, all in all, a very convenient, home-like place, with nothing\r\npretentious or to terrify the most plebeian who would care to enter,\r\nand they have been there by the score and hundred. Not less than a\r\nthousand friends, neighbors, and visitors were cordially invited to\r\ncome in and shake hands with General Logan, when he visited Mr. Blaine\r\nsoon after the convention that nominated them, and received a quiet\r\nserenade, declining any public reception.\r\n\r\nA bright, important feature of Mr. Blaine’s home is his cousin, “Gail\r\nHamilton,”--Miss Abigail Dodge,--the gifted authoress. She is an\r\nintellectual companion, and an important factor in the social and\r\nhome-life of the family, deeply interested, but with native good grace,\r\nin all that pertains to the honor and welfare of her distinguished\r\nrelatives. Books, music, bric-a-brac, abound in their present home.\r\n\r\nThey do not “fare sumptuously every day,” though feasts of course\r\nthere are, but continue in their simple, democratic ways. Eating is\r\nnot a chief business in that home. The children are very intelligent,\r\nand minds, rather than stomachs, have premiums on them. When Walker\r\nwas a little fellow, long before he could read, less than two years\r\nold, he could turn to any picture in a large book; he knew them all.\r\nBut none of them have surpassed, or equalled, their father’s work\r\nat books,--going through those great lives of Plutarch by the time\r\nhe was nine years old,--and this we hear from Mrs. Blaine herself.\r\nOnly the three younger are at home,--Margaret, James Gillespie, Jr.,\r\nand Hattie, who, although she is the baby, wears glasses. She is a\r\nwide-awake and pleasant child, and finds so much of life as is now a\r\ndaily experience, a burden rather than a delight. James has many of\r\nhis father’s characteristics, it is said. He is a tall, noble, manly\r\nfellow, and, though still in his teens, has been tutoring in Washington\r\nthe past winter. Margaret, older than Hattie or James, has achieved a\r\nnational reputation by a dexterous use of the telephone at the time of\r\nher father’s nomination. She was the first to receive the intelligence.\r\nShe has mature, womanly ways, and is very like her mother, though\r\nthe children all resemble their father,--have his strong, marked\r\nfeatures,--unless it may be Emmons or Alice.\r\n\r\nAlice was the oldest daughter, and would accompany, with perhaps\r\nother members of the family, Mrs. Blaine herself, at times, back in\r\nthe editorial days, upon the press-excursions. Upon those occasions\r\nMr. Blaine was in his glory, full of facts, full of life, and full of\r\nstories. There was none of the wag or loafer about him; he was never\r\nidle or obsequious; but he knew all about the bright side of things,\r\nand never failed to find it. His own life seemed to light up all around\r\nhim. The ludicrous side was as funny as the mean was despicable. He\r\nwas very popular among the journalists of the state. He was an honor\r\nto the craft, and they felt it, and easily recognized him as a royal\r\ngood fellow,--a sort of leader or representative man. He was called out\r\nwhen toasts were to be responded to or speeches to be made, and was\r\nthe captivating man on all occasions. The crowd gathered about him. He\r\nnever would tell a story but that any lady might listen to it without\r\na blush. They were well selected, and always first-class, and told in\r\nthe shortest, sharpest manner possible. He would never spin a long\r\nyarn. It must be quickly told, and to the point, and have a special\r\nfitness for the occasion.\r\n\r\nA story that he enjoyed hugely, and could tell with a gusto inimitable,\r\nwas of a country-man elected to the legislature, and for the first\r\ntime stopping at a large hotel. The waiters were busy, and while he\r\nawaited his turn he observed a dish of red peppers in front; taking\r\none of them on his fork, he put it in his mouth, and began the work of\r\nmastication. All eyes were turned on him. The process was a brief one,\r\nand he very soon raised his fair-sized hand, and, taking that pepper\r\nfrom his mouth, laid it beside his plate, and said, as he drew in a\r\nlong breath to cool off his blistered tongue, “You lie thar until you\r\ncool!” This was only matched by one regarding a man from the interior,\r\nat a hotel-table in St. Louis, who, observing a glass of iced-milk on\r\nthe outer circle of dishes that surrounded the plate of a gentleman\r\nopposite to him, reached for it and swallowed it down. The gentleman\r\nwatched him closely, and, with some expression of astonishment, said\r\nsimply,--\r\n\r\n“That’s cool!”\r\n\r\n“Ya-as,” the fellow blustered out, “of course it is; thar’s ice in it!”\r\n\r\nFew toasts touch the heart of Mr. Blaine more deeply than the great\r\ntoast of the family and of friendship, and one to which he could\r\nrespond with the happiest grace and the liveliest good cheer, “Here’s\r\nto those we love, and those who love us! God bless them!”\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine drinks no liquors, not even the lightest kinds of wine, I\r\nam credibly informed by one who was with him on those occasions, and\r\nfrequently at his table.\r\n\r\nMrs. Blaine, like her husband, is a great reader, and while a devoted\r\nmother and faithful wife, never neglecting her home, husband, or her\r\nchildren, has kept herself well informed, and is intelligent and\r\nattractive in conversation.\r\n\r\nOld friends say, “I do love to hear Mrs. Blaine talk; she has a fine\r\nmind, is so well educated, and so well informed.”\r\n\r\nAn old school-mate testifies that she was a fine scholar when at the\r\nacademy over the river from her present home, and that she also studied\r\nand finished her education at Ipswich.\r\n\r\nShe has trained her children with a skill that few mothers could\r\ncommand. Her children are her jewels, and are loved with a mother’s\r\naffection. They are as stars, while her husband is as the great sun\r\nshining in the heaven of her joys.\r\n\r\nThe present Augusta home has been, for years, little more than a\r\nsummer-resort, to which they have come the first of June. Their great\r\nhome has been in Washington. This, for twenty years, has been life’s\r\ncentre to them. Here home-life has reached its zenith; its glories\r\nhave shone the brightest; it has been at the nation’s capital, and\r\nhusband and father among the first men of the nation. Wealth has been\r\nat their command, to make that home all they desired. They could fill\r\nit with the realizations of their choicest ideals, and friends, almost\r\nworshipers, have come and gone with the days and hours, from all parts\r\nof the nation. They have lived in the nation’s life. They have been in\r\nthe onward drift and trend of things, ever on the foremost wave, caught\r\nin the onward rush of events. Life has been of the intensest kind, rich\r\nin all that enriches, noble in all that ennobles. They have occupied a\r\nlarge place in the nation, and the nation has occupied a large place\r\nin them; and yet, though at the very farthest remove from the quiet,\r\nsimple life of the cottage or the farm, it has been an American home;\r\nit could be no other with such a united head, and retains much of the\r\nold simplicity. The habits of early life are still on them, and in\r\nnothing are they estranged from the people.\r\n\r\nIt has been an experience with them so long, and came on so early in\r\nits beginnings, and gradually, that they have become accustomed to\r\nhonor and distinction.\r\n\r\nAnother home is likely to be theirs in Washington, the crown of all\r\nthe others. But in it they will be the same they are now; just as glad\r\nto see their friends, as home-like as themselves, as genuine and true.\r\nTheir heads cannot be turned if they have not been, and home in the\r\nWhite House will be, if in reserve for them, the same dear, restful,\r\ncheerful spot, for the loved ones will be there, and that makes home,\r\nnot walls, and floor, and furniture.\r\n\r\nPhotographs of the family abound at Mr. Blaine’s, all except the\r\npicture of Mrs. Blaine,--she has not had it taken. “They are not true,”\r\nshe says, and she brought a half-dozen of her husband, and only one\r\nseemed good, and she admitted it. The others showed, I thought, how\r\nterrific has been the conflict of life with him. They show him when\r\nhaggard and worn, and perhaps prove, by her judgment on them, how\r\nconsummate is her ideal of the man of her heart. Mr. Blaine loves the\r\nopen air. The hammock, seen in the back-ground of the picture of his\r\nhouse, is soothing and restful to him, and to a man of such incessant\r\nactivity rest is very welcome. He was out in the hammock, as shown\r\nin the picture of his home, with his family and some of his nearest\r\nneighbors about him, when the balloting was going on in Chicago. The\r\nthird ballot had just been taken when his neighbor, Mr. Hewins, came on\r\nthe grounds.\r\n\r\n“Well, Charley,” he said, “you don’t see anybody badly excited about\r\nhere, do you?”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Blaine,” he said, “was the coolest one of the company.”\r\n\r\nThese lawn-scenes are a part of the home-life, a very large and\r\npleasant part; for there are no pleasanter grounds in Augusta than\r\nthose surrounding Mr. Blaine’s modest mansion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nXIX.\r\n\r\nCHARACTERISTICS OF MR. BLAINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn conversation with a leading business man in Maine, the question was\r\nasked, “What are the chief characteristics of Mr. Blaine?” The man was\r\nwell situated to know, and well fitted to comprehend, although he was\r\nnot the man to analyze character, except in a general way, and largely\r\nfrom a business point of view. His answer was,--\r\n\r\n“His immense industry; his great enlightenment, and he has always been\r\na growing man! He has such great force of character, and such large\r\nintellectual power, and then he is such a social man. He knows so much,\r\nand is so interesting in conversation. He will talk to a peasant so\r\nthat he will take it all in, and a prince sitting by will enjoy it.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Lincoln and his wife, New England people, but from the\r\nSandwich Islands, where he had been for some five years in charge of\r\na vessel, called to see him about the middle of June, to pay their\r\ncongratulations; and it was pleasant to observe, how, without a trace\r\nof aristocracy, but with a genuine manliness, he sat down just like a\r\nbrother, and talked with them of their interests, the Island and ocean\r\naffairs, and observed, “They don’t have any more roast missionary out\r\nthere now”; but this was slipped into a sentence that almost gave a\r\nhistory of the Islands. And as he discussed ocean problems, routes to\r\nMexico, and different parts of America, North and South, the captain’s\r\neyes opened with admiration. And it was not a display of knowledge, but\r\nbrought out in questions, as to what do you think of such a project,\r\nand in stating a few brief reasons for it, the man’s information not\r\nonly cropped out, but burst forth. He seems so full of it, that when it\r\ncan find a vent it comes forth in deluge fashion, much as water does\r\nfrom a fire-plug.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine never could be a specialist, but must be world-wide in his\r\nknowledge, as he is in his sympathies. Some men are like ponds in which\r\ntrout are raised,--small and narrow, serve a single purpose, and serve\r\nit well; but he is more like the ocean,--broad, and grand, and manifold\r\nin the purposes he serves, and deep as well. Mr. Blaine is not a\r\nshallow man. His has not been the skimming surface-life of the swallow,\r\nbut rather the deep-delving life of reality and substance. Deep-sea\r\nsoundings, both of men and things, have been a peculiar delight to him.\r\n\r\nCuriosity has ever been a secret spring in him. He must know all, and\r\nhe would hunt, and rummage, and delve, and search, until he did. He\r\nhas the scent of a greyhound for evidence, however abstract, and he\r\nwould track it down somehow, “with all the precision of the most deadly\r\nscience,” as he did the telegram which Proctor Knott suppressed. This\r\ninborn faculty, which he has developed to a marvelous degree, has been\r\na mighty weapon of defence to him, when combinations and conspiracies\r\nhave been formed against him, and of the most cruel character, for his\r\ndestruction. For, let it not be forgotten, that he has lived through\r\nthat era of American life when the great effort was to kill off,\r\npolitically, the great men of the Republican party. A rebel congress\r\nof Southern brigadiers did their worst, but the nation applauded as he\r\ntriumphed.\r\n\r\nThe same knowledge seems greater power in him than in ordinary men, or\r\nthan in almost any other man, because of his great intellectual force.\r\nJust as a dinner amounts to more in some men, because of greater power\r\nof digestion,--just as the smooth stone from the brook when in David’s\r\nsling went with greater precision and power, penetrating the forehead\r\nof Goliath. It is the man and in his combinations, manner, methods,\r\nand the time, and yet all of these have little to do with it. Force\r\nand directness seem to express it all. Conventionalities are merely\r\nconveniences to Mr. Blaine, and when not such are instantly discarded.\r\nCommon sense is the pilot of his every voyage. Everything is sacrificed\r\nto this. This, and this alone, has been the crowned king of his entire\r\ncareer, and all else merely subjects.\r\n\r\nWhat he has seen in the clear, strong light of his own best judgment,\r\nenlightened by a vast and varied knowledge, he has seized and sworn\r\nto. He has never plundered others of their cast-iron rules; he had no\r\nuse for them. Saul’s armor never fitted him. He has delighted in the\r\nfathers’ reverences and laws, though but seldom quotes them. He has\r\nno time or taste for such easy, common methods. He is too original.\r\nAnd this is one of the strongest features of the man. He is not simply\r\nunlike any other man, but has no need of resemblance. He has much of\r\nthe impetuosity and fiery eloquence of Clay, but then he has more of\r\nthe solid grandeur of Webster. But then he is too much like himself to\r\nbe compared intelligibly with others.\r\n\r\nThere are great extremes in his nature,--not necessarily\r\ncontradictions, yet opposites. He is one of the most fervid men, and\r\nyet one of the most stoical at times, perfectly cool when others\r\nare hot and boiling. He never loses his head. There is never a\r\nrunaway,--but great coolness and self-possession when it is needed, and\r\nability to turn on a full head of steam, when the occasion requires.\r\nHere is the testimony of a scholar and author:--\r\n\r\n“One element in his nature impressed itself upon my mind in a very\r\nemphatic manner, and that is his coolness and self-possession at the\r\nmost exciting periods. I happened to be in his library in Washington\r\nwhen the balloting was going on in Cincinnati on that hot day in\r\nJune, 1876. A telegraph-instrument was on his library table, and Mr.\r\nSherman, his private secretary, a deft operator, was manipulating its\r\nkey. Dispatches came from dozens of friends, giving the last votes,\r\nwhich only lacked a few of the nomination; and everybody predicted the\r\nsuccess of Mr. Blaine on the next ballot. Only four persons besides Mr.\r\nSherman were in the room. It was a moment of great excitement. The next\r\nvote was quietly ticked over the wire, and then the next announced the\r\nnomination of Mr. Hayes. Mr. Blaine was the only cool person in the\r\napartment. It was such a reversal of all anticipations and assurances,\r\nthat self-possession was out of the question except with Mr. Blaine.\r\n\r\n“He had just left his bed after two days of unconsciousness from\r\nsunstroke, but he was as self-possessed as the portraits upon the\r\nwalls. He merely gave a murmur of surprise, and, before anybody had\r\nrecovered from the shock, he had written, in his firm, plain, fluent\r\nhand, three dispatches, now in my possession: one to Mr. Hayes, of\r\ncongratulation; one to the Maine delegates, thanking them for their\r\ndevotion; and another to Eugene Hale and Mr. Frye, asking them to go\r\npersonally to Columbus and present his good-will to Mr. Hayes, with\r\npromises of hearty aid in the campaign. The occasion affected him no\r\nmore than the news of a servant quitting his employ would have done.\r\nHalf an hour afterward he was out with Secretary Fish in an open\r\ncarriage, receiving the cheers of the thousands of people who were\r\ngathered about the telegraph-bulletins.”\r\n\r\nThis power of self-control seems to be supreme. It is just the\r\nparticular in which so many of our great men, and small ones too, have\r\nmiserably failed. This enables him to harness all his powers and hold\r\nwell the reins,--to bring all his forces into action when emergency\r\nrequires, and send solid shot, shrapnel, or shell, with a cool head and\r\ndetermined hand.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine has a great memory. Nearly all who know him will speak of\r\nthis. He seems never to forget faces, facts, or figures.\r\n\r\nThirty years after he attended school in Lancaster, Ohio, he went\r\nthere to speak. It was, of course, known that he was coming, and an old\r\nacquaintance of the town, whom he had not seen all these years, said,\r\n“Now I am going to station myself up there by the cars, and see if he\r\nwill know me. They say he has such a wonderful memory.” Several were\r\nlooking on, watching the operation. Mr. Blaine had no sooner stepped\r\noff from the train than he spied him, and sang out at once, “Hello,\r\nJohn, how are you!” and a murmur of surprise went up from those who\r\nwere in the secret.\r\n\r\nAt another time he was near Wheeling,--my informant thought it was\r\nacross the river from Wheeling,--in Belmont County; he met a man and\r\ncalled him by name. The man said, “Well, I don’t know you.” Mr. Blaine\r\ntold him just where he met him, at a convention, and then the man could\r\nnot remember. That night he told some of his friends about it, and they\r\nsaid it was a fact; they were with him, and saw him introduced to Mr.\r\nBlaine and talk with him, and not till then did the man remember him.\r\n\r\nAs General Connor, ex-governor of Maine, who appointed Mr. Blaine to\r\nthe United States senate, said: “He could do a thing now as well as any\r\nother time.”\r\n\r\n“Governor Connor was in Washington,” he went on to relate, “and called\r\nupon Mr. Blaine when he was secretary of state, and he said, in his\r\nfamiliar way, ‘Now you talk with Mrs. Blaine awhile,’ and went into his\r\nstudy. In about an hour he called him, and all about his table were\r\nlying sheets of paper on which he had just written. It was his official\r\ndocument on the Panama canal, and which he read to the governor. It\r\nhad been produced during the past hour, and appeared in print, with\r\nscarcely a change. It came out in a white heat, but it was all in there\r\nready to be produced at any time.”\r\n\r\nThe General remarked, “This one characteristic of the man, and an\r\nelement of his popularity and hold on others, is this close confidence\r\nhe exercises in his friends, of which the above is an illustration.”\r\n\r\nAnd this touches at once another feature, and that is his ability to\r\nread character, and so to know whom to trust. He goes right into a\r\nman’s life, when he gets at him.\r\n\r\nWhile out riding, during the preparation of his volume, with his wife,\r\ntwo or three miles from Augusta, in Manchester township, he got out to\r\nwalk, and finding a farmer in a field near by, he stopped, talked with\r\nhim some time, asked him about his history, his ancestors, and found\r\nout pretty much all the man knew about himself, and could have told\r\nwhether it would do to leave his pocket-book with the man or no. Such a\r\nthing is a habit with him, and keeps him near the people, gives him a\r\nlook into their minds, a peep into their hearts, as well as a view of\r\ntheir history.\r\n\r\nCharacter-readers usually are persons of strong intuitions. They\r\nsee not so much the flesh and blood of the individual, as the soul\r\nwithin. Just giving one sharp, quick, penetrating look at the man in\r\nthe concrete, and the abstract question is settled; the man is rated;\r\nhis value written down. It is not so much a study as a look,--thought\r\ntouches thought, mind feels of mind. It is power to know clearly,\r\nquickly, strongly, and certainly, with him. He does not have to eat a\r\nwhole ham to find out whether it is tainted, nor drink an entire pan of\r\nmilk to find out whether it is sweet.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine is very obliging, and he can usually tell an opportunity\r\nfrom a chance. Life is no lottery to him; he keeps his feet on the\r\ngranite, and gives all “fortuitous combination of atoms” the slip,\r\nbeing too discriminating to invest. One day he was in the old _Journal_\r\noffice, now owned by Sprague and Son,--a very kind and considerate\r\nfirm, who are producing a sprightly daily,--when a citizen entered who\r\nhad just been appointed clerk of the Probate Court, and asked the\r\ngentleman to go on his bond. Mr. Blaine spoke up at once, “I will do\r\nit,” and then said it reminded him of a story, which he proceeded to\r\ntell:--\r\n\r\n“Governor Coney lived in Penobscot, shire-town of Penobscot County, and\r\nwas judge of the Probate Court. The sheriff of the County had failed,\r\nand Mr. Sewall, a citizen, met Judge Coney and said, ‘The sheriff has\r\nfailed, and you and I are on his bond.’ ‘Well, that’s good,’ said the\r\njudge, ‘I guess you can fix it up.’ ‘O, but my name is on the left-hand\r\nside, as a witness to his signature.’ So the unlucky judge was left\r\nto contemplate the delightful privilege of paying what amounted to a\r\nrogue’s bail.”\r\n\r\nThis same clerk of the Probate Court of former years, but still\r\na friend and neighbor, a man, however, with an unhappy physical\r\ndisability, came upon the lawn when the large committee to notify him\r\nof his nomination were gathered there to perform that duty, and as the\r\nman told me, Mr. Blaine caught sight of him off some distance, and\r\n“notwithstanding all those men were there, he spoke right up in his\r\nold, familiar way, ‘How are you, ----?’”\r\n\r\nIt shows his genuineness and simplicity. There is enough to him without\r\nputting on any airs. It could not be otherwise than that a nature so\r\nhighly wrought and intense, should be possessed of the powers of\r\nwithering scorn and just rebuke, and when the occasion required, could\r\nuse them. There happened such an occasion in 1868.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant had been invited to attend the opening of the European\r\nand North American Railway, at Vanceboro’, in the State of Maine.\r\nIt formed a new connecting-link with the British Provinces. There\r\nwas a special train of invited guests, and as General Grant was then\r\npresident, and had never been in the state before, it was quite\r\nan honor to be of the company. Mr. Blaine was, of course, of the\r\nnumber, as were the leading citizens without respect to party. A\r\nnewspaper-correspondent, without any invitation, got aboard the train,\r\nand went with the party, and on his return reported that President\r\nGrant was drunk. This cut Mr. Blaine to the quick, because of its\r\nuntruthfulness, and as he was a Republican president, and politics\r\nusually ran high in Maine during the palmy days, from 1861 to 1881,\r\nwhen Mr. Blaine was at the helm, and also because the president was\r\nguest of the state. Not long after, he met the reporter in the office\r\nof Howard Owen, a journalist of Augusta.\r\n\r\n“And if you ever saw a man scalped,”--I use the exact language,--“and\r\nthe grave-clothes put on him, and he put in his coffin, and buried,\r\nand the rubbish of the temple thrown on him forty feet deep, he was the\r\nman. I never heard anything like it in all my born days: philippics,\r\ninvectives, satires, these common things were nowhere.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what did he say?”\r\n\r\n“What didn’t he say?” was the reply,--“‘You were not invited, you were\r\nsimply tolerated; you sneaked aboard, and then came back here and lied\r\nabout us,’ etc.”\r\n\r\nBut sixteen years had effaced much, and yet the impression was vivid,\r\nas the man’s very expressive manner betokened.\r\n\r\nAnd a leading Washington correspondent, conversant with all the sights\r\nat the capital, says, “It would look strange to see him with the\r\nwhiskey-drinking crowd at either bar in the capitol building. He does\r\nnot visit them, and he does not drink.”\r\n\r\nThe great-heartedness of Mr. Blaine comes out in his book, “Twenty\r\nYears in Congress,” and shows how large are his sympathies. He devotes\r\nover fifteen pages of that great work to an historical vindication of\r\nBrig. Gen. Charles P. Stone, who was the victim chosen to atone for the\r\nBall’s Bluff disaster, in which Col. E. D. Baker, of California, a most\r\ngallant officer, lost his life. It is a deeply interesting portion of\r\nthe seventeenth chapter.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine is a great lover of fair play. He is too great to cherish\r\nany feeling of resentment, for he is true-hearted as well as\r\ngreat-hearted.\r\n\r\nIn this same chapter he presents Mr. Roscoe Conkling very handsomely,\r\nand does him the honor to quote more extensively from his speech than\r\nfrom Chandler, Lovejoy, Crittenden, Richardson, or Thad. Stevens,\r\nalthough Conkling was younger than any of them. The Republican party\r\nis like a great family to him, and he loves and cares for all, in the\r\nsense of valuing them highly for their principles’ and works’ sake, and\r\nso studies the things that make for peace,--but not peace for peace’\r\nsake, but for the sake of principle.\r\n\r\nHe asks no quarter for himself, but will follow out the behests of his\r\ngreat nature in the interests of others, and the great cause through\r\nwhich his life has run, like a thread of purest gold. It is his great\r\nfriendliness which has enabled him to take others into his very life,\r\nand live and toil for them so largely. He seems ever living outside\r\nof self,--going outside of self and entering into their cause and\r\ncondition, and making their case his own. He aims to know enough about\r\nthose within his reach so that he shall be interested in them, and can\r\nthink and feel intelligently regarding them. His whole nature acts\r\nin unison, just as heaven designed. His mind must know, and his heart\r\nmust love, and his will must act, while conscience detects and demands\r\npurity of motive.\r\n\r\nThis honor makes life a joy, a melody, a delight, and so resonant\r\nwith constant notes of praise. He cannot be idle; this is against his\r\nnature; and to be vicious would give him pain. He is not mean, or low\r\nand truckling, but large and open as the day.\r\n\r\nAn old Democrat, who had known him ever since he landed in Augusta,\r\nsaid, when asked a point-blank question about him as a man, “He is a\r\ngood neighbor and a great citizen,” and this man had had many dealings\r\nwith him, but he could not escape the impressions of his work. No man,\r\nit would seem, could stand a better examination among his neighbors.\r\nIf a court of inquiry were established, covering these points, right\r\nwhere he is best known, it would not be necessary for him to challenge\r\na juryman, or impeach a witness.\r\n\r\nThis same old Democrat said, “A number of years ago we wanted to fix\r\nup the Baptist church, and they asked me to go and see Mr. Blaine, as\r\nthey were making a general call upon the public. It was on the eve\r\nof his departure for California, but he gave his check at once for a\r\nhundred dollars, and said, ‘If that is not enough I will give you more\r\nwhen I return.’” He is interested in all good enterprises, and turns\r\nnone empty away. As an instance of the humanity of the man, a neighbor\r\nrelated the following:--\r\n\r\n“A laborer fell in a fit right out there in the road near Mr. Blaine’s\r\nhouse, and his sympathies were all roused for the man. He helped him\r\nwhat he could, and as he came out of it right away, Mr. Blaine called\r\nto his coachman, and said, ‘Fred, harness the horse, and take this man\r\nto Hallowell,’ which was ten miles away; and Mr. Blaine helped the man\r\ninto his carriage, in his kindly way, and so sent him home.” He has\r\ntime for all these occasions to help and cheer a fellow-man.\r\n\r\nAnd Mrs. Blaine is just like him. Since their return from Washington,\r\nand since the nomination, she was returning from a ride, and when near\r\nthe gate, there was a crowd. A circus was in town, and a girl had been\r\nrun over and badly hurt. Mrs. Blaine did not begin to scold and blame\r\nthe girl for being out in the crowd, but said, “Take her right into my\r\nparlor,” and they did, when she sent for a doctor, and had every care\r\ntaken of the child. She has a mother’s heart, and a mind suited for the\r\nbest companionships.\r\n\r\nThere has been a reference elsewhere to Mr. Blaine’s marked liberality\r\nas a distinguishing characteristic. He is not a wealthy man, as wealth\r\nis reckoned to-day, but whenever he has turned his great abilities to\r\nfinancial matters for the purpose of money-getting, he has succeeded,\r\nshowing most conclusively that, had he served himself all these years\r\ninstead of serving the nation, he would be worth reputed millions. As\r\nit is, he told a friend who asked him, about a year ago, if reports\r\nwere true that he was worth several millions, as people were saying,\r\nand his answer was, “No, I am worth less than half a million.”\r\n\r\nHis great activity is very noticeable, especially in society. He has\r\nbeen compared to Mr. Burlingame in his ability to see and converse\r\nwith three or four persons, while another is seeing but one. He moves\r\nrapidly at times, but with great care, especially in examining any\r\ndocument or letter requiring his signature.\r\n\r\nHe will sign nothing unless it be a common letter prepared by his\r\nprivate secretary, without reading every word. But out among men his\r\nactivity is quick and constant. He is always in motion, not in an\r\naimless, nervous way, but in a wide-awake, fully alive manner. His\r\nbattery is ever charged with the freshest and purest electricity. It\r\nwould be a thing incredible to find him asleep in the day-time.\r\n\r\nHe had a singular habit when editor, of folding up little slips of\r\npaper and inserting them between his teeth quickly, or tearing them off\r\nfrom a newspaper, inserting them, and then throwing them away, so that\r\nafter a few moments’ conversation, he would be surrounded with bits of\r\npaper which he had torn off and used in this way.\r\n\r\nLong walks have been his habit, and at times he would strike off across\r\nthe fields and jump the fences. “What,” I said to my informant, “jump\r\nthe fences?” “Yes,” he said, and another party confirmed it. To go\r\nacross lots, they say, is “the Yankee of it.”\r\n\r\nThis vigorous exercise is a part of his programme for keeping up his\r\nhealth. He has had a cross-bar also, for athletic sports, and made use\r\nof it, too. Life is never dull and monotonous with him, but always full\r\nto the brim.\r\n\r\nIt is this active, energetic spirit which took him to England, and for\r\nfour or five months all over the continent of Europe; and in 1875 to\r\nCalifornia, and up and down the Pacific coast; and it was this same\r\nmighty energy of being, which led him to make five speeches a day\r\nsometimes when he was campaigning in Ohio. He did this one day, when\r\nthe last one was to an immense assemblage in Columbus. And he generally\r\nspoke until he was quite satisfied that he had the people with him,\r\nand they were certain to vote about right when the time came. His\r\nresources of strength, at times, seems amazing. Many who have known\r\nhim for thirty years, speak of his great energy, of his decision of\r\ncharacter, of his power with an audience.\r\n\r\nHis private secretary, who has been by his side for fifteen years,\r\nsays that all the time he was speaker in congress, he was never late a\r\nsingle moment, that just exactly at twelve o’clock, the usual time for\r\nmeeting, his gavel would fall, and the House be called to order.\r\n\r\nIt is a consciousness of responsibility, and conscientiousness in\r\nthe discharge of duty, great readiness for the work, and eagerness\r\nto perform it, that have made him prompt, energetic, accurate, and\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\nHe has been among the broadest of men in his thinking, reading,\r\nobservation, experience, travel, sympathy, purpose, motive, and\r\nactivities. Truly his life has been onward and upward, and with these\r\nas his principal characteristics he has been tested as few men are\r\ntested, and not found wanting. In ten great departments,--as student,\r\nteacher, editor, stump-speaker, legislator, speaker of the House at\r\nhome, congressman, speaker of the National House of Representatives,\r\nUnited States senator, and secretary of state,--has he been tried, and\r\nnot found wanting. Only a man of transcendent abilities could have\r\ntriumphed in such a career.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nXX.\r\n\r\nNOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine’s steady march upward in the line of promotion, was constant\r\nand irresistible, from 1856 to 1876, and even that year was crowned\r\nwith a seat in the United States senate. But the presidency seemed\r\nwithin his grasp. It was the demand and expectation of the people that\r\nhe should have it. The popular fervor was intense. He was the ideal\r\nstatesman of the multitude. But the cast-iron political machinery,\r\nthen running so deftly and with such precision in several states, was\r\nmanipulated with a craftiness so subtle as to defeat their strongly\r\nexpressed and urgent wish. They were ready, hat in hand, in every\r\nstate and territory in the Union, to cheer his nomination, when the\r\nintelligence came that the “dark horse,” Rutherford B. Hayes, was the\r\nhonored man. No one was more loyal to him than Mr. Blaine.\r\n\r\nThe state machinery was run by a Corliss engine in 1880,--band, pulley,\r\nand cog united the complicated and ingenious device into a single and\r\npowerful combination of great effectiveness. The whirl of its great\r\nwheel, and the whir of the wheels within, were swift and precise in\r\ntheir momentum. There was no cessation of control, no deviation in rate\r\nof speed or execution. The result was ever the same. The steam-gauge\r\nregistered three hundred and six, simply that and nothing more. They\r\nwould “make or break,” and so they broke;--Garfield, grand, and\r\nsplendid, and worthy, came to be the convention’s man. And the people\r\nloved him and were loyal to him,--none more so than Mr. Blaine.\r\n\r\nFor the third time the people sent their chosen men to take for them\r\nthe great initiative, that they might have the long-sought privilege of\r\nendorsing him with their suffrage. It was a great day in Chicago,--that\r\nTuesday, the third of June, 1884,--when the great convention opened in\r\nthe massive exposition building, where four years before the stubborn\r\ncontest was had. Fresh men were there. The old machinery was worn out,\r\nbroken, and cast aside,--not a squeak of it was heard. New men were at\r\nthe helm when Senator Sabin, of Minnesota, chairman of the Republican\r\nNational Committee, called the convention to order.\r\n\r\nAfter prayer, and the reading of the call for the convention, Senator\r\nSabin addressed the convention, welcoming them to Chicago, as amongst\r\nthe most cherished spots in our country, sacred to the memories\r\nof a Republican. “It was the birthplace of Republican victories.\r\nHere the fathers chose that immortal chief who first led us on to\r\nvictory,--Abraham Lincoln; here they elevated to the first place in\r\nthe nation that great chieftain of the conflict,--General Grant;\r\nhere they nominated that honored soldier, that shining citizen, that\r\nrepresentative American,--James A. Garfield.”\r\n\r\nHon. John R. Lynch, of Mississippi, a colored gentleman, well known\r\nthroughout the South for his conspicuous parliamentary ability, for his\r\ncourage, and for his character, was chosen temporary chairman.\r\n\r\nThe following day, after prayer, memorials and resolutions were\r\npresented in great profusion, which were referred to committees, save\r\none, and that was, “that all are bound to support the nominee of the\r\nconvention,” which, after a determined discussion, pro and con., was\r\nwithdrawn.\r\n\r\nGen. John B. Henderson, of St. Louis, was made permanent chairman.\r\n\r\nThursday, June 5th, the nominations began. When in the call of states\r\nMaine was reached, the vast assembly arose, and for nearly six or\r\neight minutes, twelve to fourteen thousand people were shouting at the\r\ntop of their voices, cheer upon cheer, and could not be restrained.\r\nThen Judge West, of Ohio, in a speech from the people’s heart,\r\npresented, amid almost continuous applause, the name of the people’s\r\nchoice,--James G. Blaine. The names of Generals Hawley and John A.\r\nLogan had been presented.\r\n\r\nWhen Hon. T. C. Platt, of New York, seconded the nomination of Mr.\r\nBlaine, the applause broke out anew at the mention of the magic name,\r\nmore tumultuous than before. It was a nation in miniature, sending\r\nforth the sovereignty of their hearts, not to be baffled a third time,\r\nbut surely to win.\r\n\r\nGovernor Davis of Maine, Goodeloe of Kentucky, and Galusha A. Grow\r\nof Pennsylvania, joined in most exalting kind of commendations, in\r\nseconding the nomination, while flags were waved, and every conceivable\r\nform of demonstration consistent with the hour, was indulged in.\r\n\r\nMr. Townsend placed President Arthur in nomination, seconded by Bingham\r\nof Pennsylvania, Lynch of Mississippi, Winston of North Carolina, and\r\nPinchback of Louisiana.\r\n\r\nJudge Foraker, of Ohio, presented the name of John Sherman. Judge Holt,\r\nof Kentucky, seconded Mr. Sherman’s nomination, and Ex-Governor Long,\r\nof Massachusetts, seconded by George William Curtis, of New York,\r\npresented the name of Senator Edmunds, of Vermont.\r\n\r\nFriday, June 6th, after the usual prayer and preliminary exercises,\r\nthe voting began. On the first ballot Mr. Blaine had three hundred\r\nand thirty-four and one-half; Arthur, two hundred and seventy-eight;\r\nEdmunds, ninety-three; Logan, sixty-three and one-half; John Sherman,\r\nthirty; Hawley, thirteen; Lincoln, four; and W. T. Sherman, two.\r\n\r\nThe second ballot resulted in three hundred and forty-nine for Blaine;\r\ntwo hundred and seventy-six for Arthur; eighty-five for Edmunds;\r\nsixty-one for Logan; twenty-eight for John Sherman; thirteen for\r\nHawley; four for Lincoln; two for W. T. Sherman.\r\n\r\nCheering followed the announcement of gains for Blaine. With many\r\nincidents the third ballot was taken, increasing Mr. Blaine’s ballot\r\ntwenty-six votes, to three hundred and seventy-five; Arthur went down\r\nto two hundred and seventy-four; Edmunds, sixty-nine; John Sherman,\r\ntwenty-five; Logan, fifty-three; Hawley, thirteen; Lincoln, seven; and\r\nW. T. Sherman, one.\r\n\r\nCheers again rent the air, and confusion ensued; the inevitable was\r\nin sight, and motions to adjourn, and in various ways to postpone the\r\nresult, were resorted to; but Stewart, of Blaine’s native state, said,\r\n“We are ready for the brunt of battle, Mr. Chairman; let it come.” And\r\ncome it did, though filibustering abounded to prevent it.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the fourth and decisive ballot, General Logan’s\r\ndespatch came, to cast his strength for Blaine.\r\n\r\nSenator Shelby M. Cullom, of Illinois, began the stampede by announcing\r\nthirty-four votes from Illinois for Blaine, seven for Logan, and three\r\nfor Arthur.\r\n\r\nJudge Foraker, of Ohio, followed, and withdrawing John Sherman, cast\r\nforty-six votes for James G. Blaine, amid a tremendous outburst of\r\napplause.\r\n\r\nA whirlwind of vociferous cheering, unmanageable and unparalleled,\r\ngreeted the announcement: Blaine five hundred and forty-one; Arthur\r\nstill had two hundred and seven; Edmunds, forty-one; Hawley, fifteen;\r\nLogan, seven, and Lincoln, two.\r\n\r\nBut Blaine was nominated, after contesting for eight years, in three\r\nof the greatest conventions ever held, with the principal men of the\r\nnation. The nomination was made unanimous, in the midst of the wildest\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\nAt the evening session, Senator Plumb of Kansas, seconded by Judge\r\nHouck of Tennessee, Thurston of Nebraska, Lee of Pennsylvania,\r\nand Congressman Horr of Michigan, nominated John A. Logan for\r\nvice-president.\r\n\r\nGen. J. S. Robinson, in seconding the nomination of General Logan,\r\nmoved to suspend the rules and nominate him by acclamation, which was\r\ncarried.\r\n\r\nLogan’s total vote was seven hundred and seventy-nine, the New York\r\ndelegation having given six votes for Gresham, and one for Judge\r\nForaker.\r\n\r\nThe voice of the people had at last been heard, and the men of their\r\nchoice presented as the standard-bearers, and from East to West went up\r\na shout of joy, which had in it the ring of a long-cherished purpose\r\nto see that the “calling and election” of their heroes should “be made\r\nsure” at the polls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: General JOHN A. LOGAN]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nXXI.\r\n\r\nJOHN A. LOGAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was on the 9th of February, 1826, that John A. Logan was born, at\r\nMurphysborough, Ill., a little town among the hills that hem in the\r\nMississippi River. He was the eldest of eleven children.\r\n\r\nHis father was a physician, and came to America from Ireland three\r\nyears before, while his mother, Elizabeth Jenkins, was from a family\r\nthat lived in Tennessee.\r\n\r\nHe grew up, strong and powerful in youth, amid the exciting scenes of\r\npurely western life. It was a life that appealed to courage, placed a\r\npremium upon all of manly energy and exertion, and infused into him,\r\nwith every breath, that best of robust health which, like bank-stock\r\ndrawing a high rate of interest, has met every demand made upon it for\r\nover half a century.\r\n\r\nHis advantages of education in early youth were of a slender character,\r\nexcept as he derived instruction from the teaching of his father and at\r\nhis mother’s knee; for no regular schools existed in the settlement,\r\nexcept at a log school-house, where an itinerant teacher presided,\r\nunder whose tuition only the quickest and aptest boy or girl would make\r\nadvancement.\r\n\r\nOne who knows him well says that when eighteen years old he was sent\r\nto the nearest school, called Shiloh Academy, under the jurisdiction\r\nof the Methodist Church, and graduated from it into the Mexican war.\r\nHe had breathed an atmosphere of war from childhood. In his youth the\r\nstories of the war of 1812 and of the Revolution were fresh in the\r\nmemories and constantly in the mouths of those about him, many of whom\r\nhad been actual participants. The Seminole and Black-Hawk wars had\r\noccurred in his youth, and personal acquaintance with many who had\r\nparticipated in them kindled in him the glow and fervor of adventure.\r\nHe enlisted in the First Illinois Regiment, and went to Mexico.\r\n\r\nThough among the youngest of the men, he came at once into prominence\r\nby his energy and bearing, and the quick activity of his mind, and the\r\ngreat fearlessness with which he occupied and held each post of danger\r\nto which he was assigned.\r\n\r\nThere was about him such an utter abandonment to the work of battle,\r\nthat his strong marks of leadership were quickly recognized, and he was\r\nmade lieutenant, then adjutant, and finally quartermaster, a position\r\nof grave responsibility in the enemy’s country.\r\n\r\nAfter the war he studies at college, and then reads law with his uncle,\r\nAlexander M. Jenkins, who was a great man in southern Illinois. He had\r\nat one time been lieutenant-governor of the state, and was a Jacksonian\r\nDemocrat.\r\n\r\nIn 1849 Mr. Logan was elected clerk of Jackson County, and continued\r\nhis study of law. He took a course of law-lectures at Louisville, and\r\nwas admitted to the bar. He commenced practice with his uncle, and soon\r\ngained prominence. But political life, for one so active, filled with\r\nan unbounded energy, had charms for him.\r\n\r\nSoon after his return from Louisville, he was elected prosecuting\r\nattorney for Jackson County, in 1852, and the same year to the\r\nlegislature, and re-elected in 1853, 1856, and 1857. In 1854 he was\r\nelected prosecuting attorney of the third judiciary district of\r\nIllinois, and in 1856 was a presidential elector on the Buchanan and\r\nBreckenridge ticket.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time he began his career as a stump-speaker, and his\r\nspeeches were regarded as remarkable examples of eloquence, giving\r\nhim a reputation that sent him to congress in 1858. He was an earnest\r\nDouglas man, and being re-nominated in 1860, he stumped the state\r\nwith great success, and was re-elected by a large majority. This was\r\na transition period. The great contest was coming on, and “the piping\r\ntimes of peace” were angry with the most dread forebodings.\r\n\r\nAt this point we will let one speak who knows him well:--\r\n\r\n“Right here came a critical period in his career, and although there\r\nare men who still assert that his sympathy was with the secessionists,\r\nthere is plenty of evidence that the South had no claim upon him,--that\r\nwhatever his original sentiments may have been, his public utterances\r\nwere always loyal, and that when the crisis came he was on the right\r\nside. The country he lived in was full of Southern sympathizers, his\r\nmother’s family were secessionists, and his surroundings made loyalty\r\nunpopular. The story that he tendered his services to Jefferson Davis\r\nis contradicted by that gentleman, who says he never heard of Logan\r\nuntil more than a year after the war began.\r\n\r\n“There are several witnesses to the fact that in November, 1860, when\r\nLincoln’s election was assured, and threats were freely made that\r\nhe should not be inaugurated, Logan publicly declared that he would\r\nshoulder a musket and escort the ‘Rail-Splitter’ to the White House.\r\n\r\n“While he was in Washington, attending the called session of congress\r\nin the summer of 1861, he went to the front, as many representatives\r\ndid, to visit the army in Virginia, and being the guest of Colonel\r\nRichardson when the battle of Bull Run took place, he was given a\r\nmusket and fought through that eventful July day as a private in the\r\nranks.”\r\n\r\nWhen congress adjourned in August, he went home, resigned his seat in\r\ncongress, raised the Thirty-first Illinois Regiment, was commissioned\r\nits colonel, and led them into battle at Belmont, Missouri, ten months\r\nafter they were mustered into service. One has well said, “Logan was\r\ndeveloped by the war. The bugler of the army sounded the key-note of\r\nhis character, and in an atmosphere of dust and powder he grew great.”\r\n\r\nIn that first battle at Belmont he had his horse shot under him, while\r\nleading a successful bayonet-charge. He fought with General Grant at\r\nFort Henry, and in the siege and terrific contest at Fort Donelson he\r\nbore a brave, conspicuous part, and was wounded in the left arm. He\r\nwas off duty for a while, and refused a re-election to congress, but\r\nreported on March 5th to General Grant for duty at Pittsburgh Landing,\r\nonly about a month after the Fort Donelson engagement, and was at once\r\nmade a brigadier-general.\r\n\r\nNashville had fallen. Tennessee was largely within the Union lines,\r\nand entrance was being effected into Georgia and Mississippi; hence\r\nthe stubborn resistance of the foe at Pittsburgh Landing. But victory\r\nbrought them to the siege of Corinth, Island No. 10 falling under the\r\nguns of Commodore Foote. Grant and Logan led their armies down to\r\nVicksburg.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter-campaign in Mississippi and the siege of Vicksburg,\r\nLogan’s bravery was proverbial. He was given command of a division in\r\nMcPherson’s corps, and made a major-general in the army, within a year\r\nof entrance.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1862 he was repeatedly urged to “run for\r\ncongress,” but his reply was worthy a hero: “I have entered the field\r\nto die, if need be, for this Government, and never expect to return\r\nto peaceful pursuits until the object of this war of preservation has\r\nbecome a fact established.”\r\n\r\nHis personal bravery and military skill were so conspicuous in Grant’s\r\nNorthern Mississippi movements, where he commanded a division of the\r\nSeventeenth Army Corps, under General McPherson, he was promoted to\r\nthe rank of major-general Nov. 26, 1862. He was present in every fight,\r\nhis daring bravery animating his men at Fort Gibson, Raymond, Jackson,\r\nChampion Hill, and Vicksburg. He was in command of McPherson’s centre,\r\nJune 25th, when the assault upon Vicksburg was made. His column led the\r\nentrance into the city, and he became its first military governor.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1863, he was called to succeed General Sherman in command\r\nof his famous Fifteenth Army Corps. The following May he joined Sherman\r\nas the Georgia campaign was opening. It was Logan who led the advance\r\nof the Army of the Tennessee at Resaca, who whipped Hardee’s trained\r\nveterans at Dallas, and drove the enemy from Kenesaw Mountain.\r\n\r\nOn July 22d he was in the fierce assault before Atlanta. In this\r\ndesperate attack upon Hood, Logan fought as he never fought before, and\r\nwhen McPherson fell he took command of the Army of the Tennessee, and\r\nwith resistless fury avenged the death of the beloved commander.\r\n\r\nAfter the fall of Atlanta he returned to Illinois, temporarily, to\r\ntake part in the presidential campaign. It was our privilege to hear\r\nhim then, and never, it would seem, did such withering scorn, such\r\nutter denunciation, such infinite contempt, show themselves, as he\r\nmanifested in a great speech, full of vim and fire, not for the brave,\r\nhonest rebel in arms, but for the cowardly copperheads in the rear.\r\n\r\nHe was less than forty years of age, only thirty-eight, but his name\r\nand fame as a soldier were a tower of strength, and he drew together\r\nimmense crowds.\r\n\r\nSoon after Mr. Lincoln’s second election he returns to the front, and\r\njoins Sherman in his march to the sea, and continued with him until\r\nthe surrender of Gen. Joseph Johnston, on April 26, 1865. After the\r\nsurrender he marched his men to Alexandria, and rode at their head in\r\nthe grand review in Washington. He had taken command of the Army of\r\nthe Tennessee, Oct. 23, 1864, and tendered his resignation when active\r\nservice was over, being unwilling to draw pay unless on duty in the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nPresident Johnson tendered him the mission to Mexico, but he declined\r\nit, and returning home was elected successively to the fortieth, the\r\nforty-first, and the forty-second congresses. He was selected as one of\r\na committee of seven to represent the House in the impeachment trial of\r\nAndrew Johnson.\r\n\r\nBefore he had taken his seat in the forty-second congress, the\r\nlegislature of Illinois elected him to the United States senate for\r\nthe full term from March 4, 1871, to succeed the Hon. Richard Yates,\r\nthe gallant war-governor of that state. He was again chosen for the\r\nsenate, and took his seat the second time March 18, 1879. His present\r\nterm expires March 3, 1885. He led the delegation of his state in\r\nthe national convention of 1880, and was one of the most determined\r\nof the “three hundred and six” who followed the fortunes of “the old\r\ncommander,” General Grant.\r\n\r\nHe has been an active man at military reunions, and was one of the\r\nfounders of the Grand Army of the Republic. He was the first national\r\ncommander of that organization, and as such issued the order in 1868\r\nfor the decoration of the graves of Union soldiers.\r\n\r\nHis financial views have been the subject of criticism, but they have\r\ngenerally represented the sentiments of his constituency. In 1866\r\nhe took strong grounds in favor of the payment of the national debt\r\nin gold coin. In 1874 he followed the popular Western movement, and\r\nvoted for the Inflation bill, which President Grant vetoed. But in the\r\nfollowing year he favored the Sherman Resumption act.\r\n\r\nGeneral Logan was always a leader in securing pension legislation. He\r\nhas been radical in favoring internal improvements, has always voted\r\nfor liberal appropriations for rivers and harbors, and has given his\r\nsupport to railroad land-grant measures. His property consists of a\r\nresidence on Calumet Avenue in Chicago, which is worth from twenty-five\r\nthousand to thirty thousand dollars, and a farm at his old home in\r\nsouthern Illinois.\r\n\r\nHe resides in Washington at a boarding-house on Twelfth Street,\r\noccupying two modest rooms, the same in which he has lived for twelve\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nIn 1855 he married Miss Mary Cunningham, of Shawneetown, Ill., and she\r\nhas proved a most valuable helpmeet, being as good, if not a better\r\npolitician than himself, and a lady of great refinement as well as\r\nintellectual force. There is no woman in public life who possesses\r\nmore admirable traits than Mrs. Logan, and her popularity with her own\r\nsex is quite as great as with the other. She can write a speech on\r\nfinance, or dictate the action of a political caucus, with as much ease\r\nand grace as she can preside at a dinner-party, or receive her guests.\r\nAt the same time she is a devoted mother. She has two children,--a\r\ndaughter, who is the wife of Paymaster Tucker, of the army, and a son,\r\nManning, a cadet at West Point. Both of them have been educated by her,\r\nor under her personal supervision.\r\n\r\nAs a society woman she is graceful and accomplished; in charities she\r\nis always active and generous; in religion she is a devout Methodist.\r\n\r\nDuring the campaign of 1866 General Logan was running for\r\ncongressman-at-large. The multitudes came to hear him; a grand stand\r\nwas erected in the court-house yard at Bloomington; thousands were\r\ngathered, filling the grounds and covering the roofs of buildings.\r\nHe was in his glory; for three hours he spoke; the people laughed,\r\nand cried, and shouted cheer on cheer. We had heard Douglas, Lovejoy,\r\nColfax, but never such a speech as that.\r\n\r\nThe rebel army was whipped and gone, and now the Democratic party\r\nloomed up as an enemy in the land.\r\n\r\nIn telling why he had left the party and become a staunch Republican,\r\nhis sarcasm burned like caustic. He told a story in an inimitable way,\r\nto illustrate the point. It was the story of the flock of sheep the\r\nfarmer gave his boys:--\r\n\r\n“Tommy was to divide the flock, and Johnny take his choice, so Tommy\r\nput all the fine, large ones by themselves, and all the scabby, scaly,\r\nshaggy ones in another yard, and with them he put Johnny’s little pet\r\nlamb, which he had raised and cared for all summer, feeding it with\r\nfresh, warm milk, and had put a little blue ribbon, with a bell on\r\nit, about its neck; and Tommy knew how he loved it, and so he put it\r\nin with the poor, old, scaly lot of sheep. When Johnny came to look at\r\nthe sheep he looked for Nannie, his lamb; he heard its bell, and saw\r\nit was in bad company, with a miserable lot of bad sheep, and so he\r\nsaid, ‘Nannie, good-bye; I’ve loved you. I tied that blue ribbon about\r\nyour neck, and put that bell on it. I’ve fed you and taken care of you\r\nall this time’ (and this description was given with the most dramatic\r\neffect); ‘but, Nannie, we must part. Johnny, I will take this lot,’\r\npointing to all the best sheep.”\r\n\r\nThe roar was tumultuous when they saw the point, and it was a terrific\r\nhit for the old party, in with the copperheads and rebels.\r\n\r\nIt was surely one of the happiest steps of his life, when he came out\r\non the Republican side of the Republic’s great battle for the liberty\r\nof the enslaved and the citizenship of freemen.\r\n\r\nFew soldiers are now living, not excepting the old commander himself,\r\nwho in a political campaign will make the heart of the old veterans\r\nbeat faster and warmer at the remembrance of former times, and\r\nthe achievements of battles now enjoyed, than Gen. John A. Logan,\r\nUnited States senator from Illinois, and Republican candidate for\r\nvice-president, with James G. Blaine, of Maine, for president.\r\n\r\nThe old hearts thrill anew, and the old shout rings out again, and the\r\nvictory of the past must at their hands be perpetuated in the victory\r\nof the future.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _FINIS._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSCRIBER’S NOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Italicized text is surrounded by underscores: _italics_.\r\n\r\n  Obvious typographical errors have been corrected.\r\n\r\n  Inconsistencies in hyphenation have been standardized.\r\n\r\n  Archaic or variant spelling has been retained.\r\n\r\n  Pages 7, 8, 17 and 18 are missing in this edition.",
