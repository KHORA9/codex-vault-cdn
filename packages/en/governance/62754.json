In the first years of its appearance it was compared to the\r\n“krypteia” of Sparta, to the “eterie” of Athens, and to similar\r\nphenomena, which are repeated as a manifestation of self-defence of\r\nstrong and active groups or classes, uniting and forming centres of\r\nresistance; exercising thus, by their extended action, general functions\r\nof State in a period in which its protection is weak or inefficient, and\r\nshows signs of disintegration or degeneration. Other examples of this\r\nphenomenon can be found in the history of the Church and in the Italian\r\nCommunes, in England, Germany, in the Clubs of the French Revolution,\r\nand in the rest of Europe. When in a nation which shows such signs this\r\nform of vitality does not exist, we witness the general collapse of that\r\nnation, as in Russia at this moment, where only the radical uprooting of\r\nBolshevism might lead to the general resurrection of the country.\r\n\r\nThe after-war period in Italy, as elsewhere, had caused complete apathy,\r\nslackness and disorder in Parliamentary State functions, characterised\r\nby many elaborate programmes, but few facts. The Italian working\r\nclasses, moreover, had been hypnotised by the nefarious gospel of Lenin,\r\nwhich had powerfully contributed to bring about the grave state of\r\naffairs in Italy in 1920, when the Communist peril had reached its acute\r\nstage. The continued strikes in all industries had caused prices to rise\r\nat a tremendous pace; the production of commodities had been reduced to\r\na minimum; the enormous deficit in the railway and postal departments,\r\nthe debt and the general budget of the State were alarming, while\r\nforeign exchanges had reached fantastic figures. The arrogance of the\r\nCommunist elements had become unbearable, and officers at times were\r\nobliged to dress in plain clothes in order not to be attacked by\r\nBolshevists, while soldiers, Carabineers and Guardie Regie were\r\nfrequently insulted and in some instances even killed by Communists.\r\n\r\nBut the gallant fighters of the Trentino, of the Carso and of the\r\nGrappa, the volunteers who had saved Italy and arrested the advance of\r\nthe enemy on the Piave could not reconcile themselves to this state of\r\naffairs, to the idea of watching with folded arms the complete loss of\r\nthe fruits of victory for which half a million men had left their lives\r\non the battlefields. These brave youths, with an indomitable courage,\r\nready to face all, full of the purest ideals and passionate love for our\r\ncountry, representing a new force and a new Italy, had already in April\r\n1919 grouped themselves together in a “fascio” (bundle), as the “Fascio\r\nNazionale dei Combattenti” (National Fasces of Combatants), under the\r\nleadership of Benito Mussolini, who was the inspirer and organiser of\r\nthe movement and had himself been their comrade at the front.\r\n\r\nThey became stronger every day and dealt the initial blow to Communism\r\nin 1921, when the first encounter took place between Fascisti and\r\nCommunists at Bologna, which marks the waning of Bolshevism and the rise\r\nof Fascismo.\r\n\r\nBut it was not an easy matter for the new movement to make its way, as\r\nin its laborious progress it met with endless difficulties, and above\r\nall had to fight the apathy of the people and the general scepticism\r\nregarding it. Fascismo had to deal with peculiar mentalities, to fight\r\nvarious organisations, including the State, which felt itself being\r\nundermined by this new political group, while its chief enemy, the\r\nBolshevist faction, had made endless victims among its rank and file\r\nduring the past.\r\n\r\nIt was not possible, however, for the Fascisti to deal with the\r\nCommunists otherwise than by using violence, as normal means would have\r\nbeen entirely inadequate against the seditious elements (made all the\r\nmore arrogant by the manifest impotence of the State and the _laisser\r\nfaire_ attitude of public opinion), in view of the daily increasing\r\nnumber of crimes committed against property and peaceful individuals.\r\n\r\nFascisti, moreover, started a strong movement against the composition of\r\nthe Chamber, maintaining that it no longer represented the nation, that\r\nit had grown prematurely old and must, therefore, be quickly dissolved\r\nand a new appeal to the electors be made as soon as possible. They had\r\nbeen deeply concerned, on the other hand, with the Italian economic\r\ncrisis, which, according to Edmondo Rossoni, the able organiser and\r\nSecretary-General of the Syndicalist Corporations, could not be overcome\r\nwithout an increase in the production of commodities to be obtained by a\r\nmore rigorous discipline in the labour question; thus an economic\r\nvictory followed the victory on the battlefields. The masses of the\r\nworking classes, many of them previously Socialists and Communists,\r\nenrolled themselves among the Fascisti syndicates scattered all over\r\nItaly and were able to settle various important disputes.\r\n\r\nThe alleged dissension between Fascismo and the Italian Monarchy had\r\nalways been a favourite weapon in the hands of the anti-Fascisti\r\nelements. The Hon. Mussolini, in his speech at the great Fascista Mass\r\nMeeting at Naples on 24th October of last year, clearly manifested his\r\nparty feeling in the matter, as can be gathered by his own words uttered\r\nthere (see Part IV. page 171, of this collection). The attitude of\r\nFascismo towards Monarchy clearly defined by its leader was very\r\nopportune, and contributed to the greater popularity of the movement\r\nthroughout the country, where this institution rests on a solid base,\r\nrepresents Italian unity, and is to-day associated with its illustrious\r\nrepresentative, King Victor Emmanuel III., an example of domestic virtue\r\nin private life, one of the most cultured men of our times, beloved by\r\nall classes, who at the front proved himself the first soldier among\r\nsoldiers and gained the popularity of the whole nation.\r\n\r\nThe Army was secretly or openly greatly in favour of Fascismo, the\r\nsuccessful efforts of which to save the country from the\r\nSocial-Communist factions it could not forget. The soldiers could,\r\ntherefore, never have marched against the Fascisti—who represented\r\nItalian patriotism. The very generals of the regular Army, such as\r\nGenerals Fara, Ceccherini, Graziani, de Bono, and others, in black\r\nshirts, themselves directed the famous “March to Rome.”\r\n\r\nWith reference to religion, Mussolini’s Government promised to respect\r\nall creeds, especially Catholicism. At Ouchy he said to the Press: “My\r\nspirit is deeply religious. Religion is a formidable force which must be\r\nrespected and defended. I am, therefore, against anti-clerical and\r\natheistic democracy, which represents an old and useless toy. I maintain\r\nthat Catholicism is a great spiritual power, and I trust that the\r\nrelations between Church and State will henceforward be more friendly.”\r\nAnd while the Minister for Public Instruction, Senator Gentile, has\r\nintroduced compulsory religious instruction in the elementary public\r\nschools, the Under-Secretary of the same Ministry, Hon. Dario Lupi, one\r\nof Mussolini’s closest friends, issued, as one of his first acts, a\r\ntimely and peremptory order to the school authorities requesting the\r\nimmediate replacement of the Crucifix and the picture of the King.\r\n\r\nFascismo, which during the last months of 1922 had seen its membership\r\nincreasing by leaps and bounds, finally won with a note of fanaticism\r\nthe very heart of the country from the Alps to the southern shores of\r\nSicily. Latterly it had exercised the functions of State almost\r\nundisturbed, and did not spare either institutions or individuals in the\r\npursuit of its end. It had demanded and successfully obtained the\r\ndismissal of the Pangermanist Mayor of Bolzano, Herr Perathoner; it had\r\noccupied the Giunta Provinciale of Trento, causing the removal of the\r\nItalian Governor, maintaining that he had been too weak in his attitude\r\ntowards arrogant Pangermanists in that region; and had acted\r\nsuccessfully as arbitrator in the labour dispute between Cantiere\r\nOrlando of Leghorn and the Government itself. It was no wonder, then, if\r\nafter the big October meeting of last year at Naples and the “March to\r\nRome” with the famous Quadrumvirate formed by General Cesare de Bono,\r\nHon. Cesare Maria de Vecchi, Italo Balbo, and Michele Bianchi, then\r\nSecretary-General of the Party, Mussolini, the creator of this mighty\r\nmovement, was summoned by the King to form the new Fascista Cabinet.\r\n\r\nIt might be a cause of surprise to the superficial observer, this sudden\r\nascent to power of a party which, a few days before it took the\r\ngovernment into its hands, had been threatened with martial law, an\r\norder which the King wisely refused to sign, thus avoiding civil war.\r\nBut whoever has followed the development and progress of Fascismo during\r\nthe last four years, considers its great strength and power in the\r\ncountry, its formidable membership (now over a million strong) compared\r\nwith that of any other party (the Socialists are reduced to seventy\r\nthousand), and takes into account the high and patriotic principles on\r\nwhich this movement is founded will not wonder that the party got to\r\npower through an extra-parliamentary crisis. We cannot and must not\r\nforget that these “black shirts”—as the Fascisti are called—have really\r\nsaved Italy from Bolshevism, which was sucking her very life-blood, and\r\nthat they are thereby entitled to the gratitude of our country and of\r\nthe world at large. “The Moscow conspirators, whose object was the\r\noverthrow of Western civilisation, swept with a wide net,” writes Lord\r\nRothermere in his recent article, _Mussolini: What Europe owes to him_.\r\n“They made great headway in Germany, especially in Berlin; they seized\r\nBudapest under the direction of a convicted thief, but it was upon Italy\r\nthey counted most, and when Mussolini struck against them in Italy, he\r\nwas fighting a battle for all Europe.”\r\n\r\nI do not think—and the Hon. Mussolini agreed with me in one of the\r\nconversations I had with him—that people abroad, especially in England\r\nand the United States, know much about Fascismo. It had been diagnosed\r\nas a sporadic revolutionary movement, which sooner or later would be put\r\ndown by drastic measures. Not many have realised that in this after-war\r\nperiod there is no more important historical phenomenon than Fascismo,\r\nwhich, as our Prime Minister said, “is at the same time political,\r\nmilitary, religious, economic and syndicalist, and represents all the\r\nhopes, the aspirations and requirements of the people.” The popular air\r\n“Giovinezza” (Youth), the official song of the Fascisti, with its\r\nthrilling notes, which magnetised the heart of the people, the\r\ncharacteristic black shirts with the shield of the “fascio” on their\r\nbreasts, the “gagliardetti” (Fascisti standards)—all these have largely\r\ncontributed towards rousing a delirium of enthusiasm among the masses\r\nfor the great cause.\r\n\r\nBut three other important elements account for the success of the\r\n“National Fascista Party” (as it is now officially constituted, with its\r\n“Great National Council”), namely its military organisation, its\r\npowerful Press, and, above all, the personality of Mussolini himself,\r\nthe “Duce,” as he is called. The military organisation is entirely on\r\nRoman lines, with Roman names of “legion,” “Consul,” “cohort,” “Senior,”\r\n“Centurion,” “Decurion,” “Triari,” etc. The symbol of Fascismo is the\r\nsame as that of the lictors of Imperial Rome—a bundle of rods with an\r\naxe in the centre—and the Fascista salute is that of the ancient\r\nRomans—by outstretched arm. The coins which are being struck bear on one\r\nside the King’s head and on the other the Roman “fascio;” in the same\r\nway special gold coins of one hundred lire will be issued shortly, to\r\ncelebrate the first anniversary of the “March to Rome.” There is the\r\nmost rigorous discipline, and the motto: “No discussion, only\r\nobedience,” has proved of immense value in all the sudden mobilisations\r\nand demobilisations carried out, often at a few hours notice, which\r\ncould give points to the best organised army in the world. On the\r\noccasion of the mass meeting preceding the “March to Rome,” which was\r\nattended by over half a million men, in less than twenty-four hours\r\nforty thousand left the town in perfect order and without the slightest\r\nhitch.\r\n\r\nFascismo possesses a large Press, which comprises five dailies and a\r\nlarge number of weekly, fortnightly and monthly publications and a\r\npublishing house in Milan.\r\n\r\nBut the decisive factor in the great victory of Fascismo is due to the\r\npersonality of the great leader of this army of Italy’s salvation, the\r\nvery soul of this mighty movement.\r\n\r\nFew public men of our time have had a more rapid, brilliant and\r\ninteresting career than Benito Mussolini, the son of a blacksmith. He is\r\nthe youngest of his predecessors in this office, as he was born only\r\nforty years ago at Predappio, in the province of Forli, where the\r\nvillagers still call him simply “Our Benit.” He was deeply attached to\r\nhis mother, Rosa Maltoni, and her death caused him intense sorrow. He\r\nhas one sister, Edvige, and a younger brother, Arnaldo, who, since the\r\nelder one has become Prime Minister, has taken his place as editor of\r\n_Il Popolo d’Italia_. Mussolini first worked in his father’s forge and\r\nthen, having occupied for a time the position of village schoolmaster,\r\nemigrated to Switzerland, from which country he was, however, expelled\r\non account of articles he had written advocating the Marxist doctrines.\r\nReturning once more to Italy, he became an active member of the\r\nSocialist Party and finally editor of its organ, the _Avanti_. Upon the\r\noutbreak of war in 1914, with his keen political insight, Mussolini saw\r\nthe necessity of Italian intervention, and in consequence was forced to\r\nleave the official Socialist Party, giving up all the positions he held\r\nin it. He founded his _Popolo d’Italia_, and began fiercely to sound the\r\ntrumpets of war, inciting his country to abandon her neutral attitude\r\nand to throw in her lot with the Allies. He gained his end, and in 1915\r\nhe went to the front as a simple soldier in the 11th Bersagliere\r\nRegiment. In 1917, as the result of the bursting of a shell, he received\r\nthirty-eight simultaneous wounds; he was obliged to go to hospital, was\r\npromoted on the field, and invalided out of the Army. He then returned\r\nto Milan, and having resumed the editorship of his paper, the _Popolo\r\nd’Italia_, began his political battles, and continued to fight through\r\nits columns, spurring his countrymen on to final victory.\r\n\r\nWith no exaggeration it can be stated that since the advent to power of\r\nMussolini every day has seen a steady advance in the direction of the\r\nrebuilding of the country within and a notable enhancement of our\r\nprestige abroad. His strenuous everyday work is inspired by an\r\nindomitable determination to make Italy worthy of the glories of\r\nVittorio Veneto, strengthened and disciplined, and he will spare neither\r\nhimself nor those around him in his attempt to bring about its\r\nrealisation.\r\n\r\nHe wishes to secure Italy’s rightful position in the world. Mussolini’s\r\nforeign policy of dignity, honesty and justice has already been outlined\r\nin his opening speech before the Chamber, and can be summarised thus:\r\n“No imperialism, no aggressions, but an attitude which shall do away\r\nwith the policy of humility which has made Italy more like the\r\nCinderella and humble servant of other nations. Respect for\r\ninternational treaties at no matter what cost. Fidelity and friendship\r\ntowards the nations that give Italy serious proofs of reciprocating it.\r\nMaintenance of Eastern equilibrium, on which depends the tranquillity of\r\nthe Balkan States and, therefore, European and world peace.”\r\n\r\nIt is enough to cast an eye on the numerous legislative and\r\nadministrative work accomplished by Mussolini’s Government in these\r\nfirst eleven months to convince oneself that he is in deep earnest as to\r\nthe vast programme of reconstruction he means to carry through. With\r\nreference to domestic matters, the Fascista Government has passed a\r\ngreat number of bills and projects of laws concerning the Electoral\r\nReform Bill approved by the Chamber last July, radical reform of the\r\nentire school system, institution of the National Militia, and abolition\r\nof the Guardie Regie (which was a poor substitute for the Carabineers),\r\nindustrialisation of Public Services (Posts, Telegraphs, Railways),\r\nabolition of Death Duties between near relations, enactment of Decree on\r\nthe Eight Hours Work Bill, reformation of the Civil Law Codes, reduction\r\nof Ministerial departments, now only nine, which formerly were sixteen,\r\nand formation of the recent Ministry of National Economy, under which\r\nare grouped various others: Industry, Agriculture, Labour, etc.,\r\nreduction of the National Debt by over a milliard, a comforting\r\ncontribution towards the balance of the Budget, as is gathered by the\r\nspeech delivered in June, at Milan, by the Minister of Finance, Hon. De\r\nStefani.\r\n\r\nMussolini, besides having established a real discipline (there are no\r\nmore strikes since the Fascista Government is in power), and having\r\nfully restored the authority of the State, has shown himself to be the\r\nmost practical anti-waste advocate which the world has yet known. As to\r\nforeign policy, besides adhering to the Washington Disarmament\r\nConference, and having signed conventions relative to the laying of\r\ncables for a direct telegraphic communication with North, Central and\r\nSouth America, negotiated important commercial treaties with Canada,\r\nRussia, Spain, Lithuania, Poland, Siam, Finland, Esthonia, etc., and\r\nhaving exercised beneficial influence in the Ruhr conflict and in the\r\nLausanne Conference, has been an element of equilibrium for the new\r\nafter-war international policy in the world.\r\n\r\nThe selection of his speeches contained in this volume is not a mere\r\ntranslation, since, in fact, the exact equivalent of this book as it has\r\nbeen arranged, classified and edited is not to be found in any other\r\nlanguage. These speeches, illustrated by the valuable prefatory notes,\r\nalmost all of which have been supplied to me by one who has been closely\r\nassociated with Mussolini during the whole of his political career,\r\nserve, in my opinion, as could no biography, to reveal the mind,\r\ncharacter and personality of Mussolini himself. Delivered at intervals\r\nthroughout the various stages of his career, from Socialist to Fascista\r\nPrime Minister, they enable the reader to follow intimately the events\r\nwhich led up to the Fascista Revolution and its leader’s attainment of\r\nhis present strong position. The forcible and sober style of his\r\ncharacter, shorn of every unnecessary word, betrays the dynamic force\r\nand intense earnestness of this man, who has been compared to Cromwell\r\nfor his drastic and dictatorial methods in the Chamber, and to Napoleon\r\nfor his eagle-like perception, for his decisiveness and his marvellous\r\npower of leadership.\r\n\r\nMussolini is a volcanic genius, a bewitcher of crowds. He seems a\r\nregular warrior, with an indomitable daring, great physical and moral\r\ncourage, and he has seen death near him without wavering. He is the real\r\ntype of Roman Emperor, with a severe bronzed face, but which hides a\r\nkind and generous heart. He is what people call a real “self-made man,”\r\nand is a great lover of the violin and of all kinds of sport: fencing,\r\ncycling, flying, riding and motoring. Mussolini gets all he wants and\r\nquickly, and, as all his party do, knows exactly what he _does_ want.\r\n\r\nApart from all that has been said, the present collection of speeches,\r\nbesides showing Mussolini’s strong hand in the difficult art of\r\nstatesmanship, displays clearly in almost every page (and so, possibly,\r\nthe book may also appeal to others than politicians), additional\r\nimportant elements which are not usually found in a volume of political\r\nspeeches, namely a richness of sympathy for mankind, a blunt\r\nstraightforwardness, a gentleness of soul together with exceptional\r\nmoral strength, pure idealism, which lift him not only above party\r\npolitics, but also high above the average of mankind.\r\n\r\nSuch is the builder of New Italy, and the enthusiasm and deep confidence\r\nwhich Mussolini has inspired in our country, and the unanimous approval\r\nhis work has prompted abroad, are a good omen for Italy’s future\r\nfortunes and for the welfare of the world at large.\r\n\r\n                                      BERNARDO QUARANTA di SAN SEVERINO.\r\n\r\n  SIENA, Via S.

Return now to your usual occupations, as,\r\nin order to arrive at the summit of her fortunes, Italy needs to work.\r\nMay nothing disturb the glory of these days through which we have just\r\npassed—days of superb passion and of Roman greatness.\r\n\r\n                                          Long live Italy!\r\n                                          Long live Fascismo!\r\n\r\n                                                      THE QUADRUMVIRATE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ERRATA\r\n\r\n\r\nPage 133, last line, _for_ wars _read_ stars.\r\n\r\nPage 140, line 24, _for_ times _read_ temples.\r\n\r\nPage 143, This Speech was delivered 20th September 1922.\r\n\r\nPage 208, line 1, _for_ Council of Munitions _read_ Council of\r\nMinisters.\r\n\r\nPage 351, line 21, _for_ 1885 _read_ 1855.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                    PAGE\r\n FACSIMILE LETTER                                                     vi\r\n\r\n INTRODUCTION: A NOTE ON ITALIAN FASCISMO                             ix\r\n\r\n REPRODUCTION OF THE ORIGINAL OF THE MANIFESTO ISSUED BY THE HON.\r\n   MUSSOLINI AFTER HE AND HIS PARTY SUCCEEDED TO THE GOVERNMENT       xx\r\n\r\n ENGLISH TRANSLATION                                                 xxi\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 PART I\r\n\r\n                        MUSSOLINI THE “SOCIALIST”\r\n\r\n “DO NOT THINK THAT BY TAKING AWAY MY MEMBERSHIP CARD YOU WILL TAKE\r\n   AWAY MY FAITH IN THE CAUSE”                                         3\r\n           (_Speech delivered at Milan, 25th November 1914._)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 PART II\r\n\r\n                     MUSSOLINI THE “MAN OF THE WAR”\r\n\r\n FOR THE LIBERTY OF HUMANITY AND THE FUTURE OF ITALY                   9\r\n           (_Speech delivered at Parma, 13th December 1914._)\r\n\r\n “EITHER WAR OR THE END OF ITALY’S NAME AS A GREAT POWER”             18\r\n            (_Speech delivered at Milan, 25th January 1915._)\r\n\r\n “TO THE COMPLETE VANQUISHING OF THE HUNS”                            25\r\n     (_Speech delivered at Sesto San Giovanni, 1st December 1917._)\r\n\r\n “NO TURNING BACK!”                                                   30\r\n            (_Speech delivered at Rome, 24th February 1918._)\r\n\r\n THE FATAL VICTORY                                                    37\r\n             (_Speech delivered at Bologna, 24th May 1918._)\r\n\r\n “IN HONOUR OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE”                                   49\r\n             (_Speech delivered at Milan, 8th April 1918._)\r\n\r\n THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS                                                52\r\n            (_Speech delivered at Milan, 20th October 1918._)\r\n\r\n IN CELEBRATION OF VICTORY                                            58\r\n           (_Speech delivered at Milan, 11th November 1918._)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PART III\r\n\r\n              MUSSOLINI THE “FASCISTA FRIEND OF THE PEOPLE”\r\n\r\n WORKMEN’S RIGHTS AFTER THE WAR                                       63\r\n            (_Speech delivered at Dalmine, 20th March 1919._)\r\n\r\n SACRIFICE, WORK, AND PRODUCTION                                      67\r\n            (_Speech delivered at Milan, 5th February 1920._)\r\n\r\n “WE ARE NOT AGAINST LABOUR, BUT AGAINST THE SOCIALIST PARTY, IN AS\r\n   FAR AS IT REMAINS ANTI-ITALIAN”                                    71\r\n              (_Speech delivered at Milan, 24th May 1920._)\r\n\r\n FASCISMO’S INTERESTS FOR THE WORKING CLASSES                         75\r\n            (_Speech delivered at Ferrara, 4th April 1921._)\r\n\r\n “MY FATHER WAS A BLACKSMITH AND I HAVE WORKED WITH HIM;

NOT THINK THAT BY TAKING AWAY MY MEMBERSHIP CARD YOU WILL TAKE AWAY\r\n                         MY FAITH IN THE CAUSE”\r\n\r\n  Speech delivered on 25th November 1914, at Milan, before the meeting\r\n    of the Milanese Socialist Section, which had decreed Mussolini’s\r\n              expulsion from the official Socialist Party.\r\n\r\n  In the fearless militarism of the dramatic speech with which this\r\n  volume begins, the Socialistic activity of Benito Mussolini ends—of\r\n  Benito Mussolini, who from the autumn of 1914 could have been\r\n  considered the recognised and acclaimed leader of the Italian\r\n  Socialist Party. He had attained with giant strides the highest rank\r\n  in the party’s hierarchy, namely the editorship of the _Avanti_, the\r\n  chief organ of the political and syndicalist movement. He had been a\r\n  clever and aggressive writer in a weekly provincial paper of Forli,\r\n  called _La lotta di classe_,[1] and an ardent Sunday orator for the\r\n  “ville” of Romagna. He had revealed himself a “comrade” of\r\n  tremendous power at the Congress of Reggio Emilia, held in the\r\n  summer of 1912, where he delivered a memorable speech bitterly\r\n  criticising the flaccid mentality of Reformism then dominating the\r\n  party.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n    Class struggle.\r\n\r\n  It was within two months of his success at Reggio Emilia that the\r\n  revolutionary leaders, feeling the need of strong men, entrusted to\r\n  Benito Mussolini the editorship of the _Avanti_, which was the most\r\n  powerful weapon of the party.\r\n\r\n  The following speech was delivered before a furious crowd of not\r\n  less than three thousand holders of membership cards, who hastened\r\n  from other centres adjacent to Milan, amid a diabolical tumult in an\r\n  atmosphere of organised hostility, which was the more violent by\r\n  contrast with the fanatical devotion which Benito Mussolini had\r\n  evoked during the two years in which he had been the undisputed\r\n  mouthpiece of the party.\r\n\r\n  This atmosphere of intolerance and hatred had been fostered by the\r\n  neutralist adversaries who had succeeded to the management of the\r\n  _Avanti_ after the present head of the Italian Government had left\r\n  the party.\r\n\r\n  As is known, the excited meeting held in the spacious hall of the\r\n  Casa del Popolo closed with a resolution for the expulsion of the\r\n  new heretic, which was passed, except by a negligible minority of\r\n  about fifty supporters, who afterwards stood by Mussolini in the\r\n  victorious campaign for intervention.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy fate is decided, and it seems as if the sentence were to be executed\r\nwith a certain solemnity. (Voices: “Louder! Louder!”)\r\n\r\nYou are severer than ordinary judges who allow the fullest and most\r\nexhaustive defence even after the sentence, since they give ten days for\r\nthe production of the motives of appeal. If, then, it is decided, and\r\nyou still think that I am unworthy of fighting any longer for your\r\ncause—(“Yes! yes!” is shouted by some of the most excited among the\r\naudience.)—then expel me. But I have a right to exact a legal act of\r\naccusation, and in this meeting the public prosecutor has not yet\r\nintervened with regard either to the political or to the moral issues. I\r\nshall, therefore, be condemned by an “order of the day” which means\r\nnothing. In a case like this, I ought to have been told that I was\r\nunworthy to belong any longer to the party for definite reasons, in\r\nwhich case I should have accepted my fate. This, however, has not been\r\nsaid, and a great many of you—if not all—will leave this room with an\r\nuneasy conscience. (Deafening voices: “No! no!”)\r\n\r\nWith reference to the moral question, I repeat once more that I am ready\r\nto submit my case to any Committee which cares to make investigations\r\nand to issue a report.\r\n\r\nAs regards the question of discipline, I should say that this has not\r\nbeen examined, because there are just and fitting precedents for my\r\nchanged attitude, and if I do not quote them it is because I feel myself\r\nto be secure and have an easy conscience.\r\n\r\nYou think to sign my death warrant, but you are mistaken. To-day you\r\nhate me, because in your heart of hearts you still love me, because....\r\n(Applause and hisses interrupt the speaker.)\r\n\r\nBut you have not seen the last of me! Twelve years of my party life are,\r\nor ought to be, a sufficient guarantee of my faith in Socialism.\r\nSocialism is something which takes root in the heart. What divides me\r\nfrom you now is not a small dispute, but a great question over which the\r\nwhole of Socialism is divided. Amilcare Cipriani can no longer be your\r\ncandidate because he declared, both by word of mouth and in writing,\r\nthat if his seventy-five years allowed him, he would be in the trenches\r\nfighting the European military reaction which was stifling revolution.\r\n\r\nTime will prove who is right and who is wrong in the formidable question\r\nwhich now confronts Socialism, and which it has never had to face before\r\nin the history of humanity, since never before has there been such a\r\nconflagration as exists to-day, in which millions of the proletariat are\r\npitted one against the other. This war, which has much in common with\r\nthose of the Napoleonic period, is not an everyday event. Waterloo was\r\nfought in 1814; perhaps 1914 will see some other principles fall to the\r\nground, will see the salvation of liberty, and the beginning of a new\r\nera in the world’s history—(Loud applause greets this fitting historical\r\ncomparison.)—and especially in the history of the proletariat, which at\r\nall critical moments has found me here with you in this same spot, just\r\nas it found me in the street.\r\n\r\nBut I tell you that from now onwards I shall never forgive nor have pity\r\non anyone who in this momentous hour does not speak his mind for fear of\r\nbeing hissed or shouted down. (This cutting allusion to the many\r\nprominent absentees is understood and warmly applauded by the meeting.)\r\n\r\nI shall neither forgive nor have pity on those who are purposely\r\nreticent, those who show themselves hypocrites and cowards. And you will\r\nfind me still on your side. You must not think that the middle classes\r\nare enthusiastic about our intervention. They snarl and accuse us of\r\ntemerity, and fear that the proletariat, once armed with bayonets, will\r\nuse them for their own ends. (Mingled applause, and cries of “No! no!”)\r\n\r\nDo not think that in taking away my membership card you will be taking\r\naway my faith in the cause, or that you will prevent my still working\r\nfor Socialism and revolution. (Hearty applause follows these last words\r\nof Mussolini, uttered with great energy and profound conviction. He\r\ndescends from the platform and makes his way down the great hall.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PART II\r\n\r\n                     MUSSOLINI THE “MAN OF THE WAR”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          FOR THE LIBERTY OF HUMANITY AND THE FUTURE OF ITALY\r\n\r\n    Speech delivered at the Scuole Mazza, Parma, 13th December 1914.\r\n\r\n  This speech was delivered under the stress of great excitement. The\r\n  most ardent supporters of active neutrality were assembled at Parma,\r\n  a citadel of revolutionary Syndicalism, which opposed Party\r\n  Socialism, and the majority of whose members, after the outbreak of\r\n  the European War, sided against the Central Empires and in defence\r\n  of intervention. Among these we remember Giacinto Menotti Serrati,\r\n  then Editor-in-chief of the _Avanti_, and Fulvio Zocchi, a\r\n  ridiculous and malignant demagogue, now removed from political life.\r\n\r\n  But, notwithstanding this pressure from outside, the people of\r\n  Parma, mindful of their Garibaldian and anti-Austrian traditions,\r\n  sided enthusiastically with Mussolini and Alcesto De Ambris, the\r\n  leader of Syndicalism and member of Parliament for the city, who had\r\n  been the first to support the section of the extremists.\r\n\r\n\r\nCitizens,—It is in your interest to listen to me quietly and with\r\ntolerance. I shall be brief, precise and sincere to the point of\r\nrudeness.\r\n\r\nThe last great continental war was from 1870 to 1871. Prussia, guided by\r\nBismarck and Moltke, defeated France and robbed her of two flourishing\r\nand populous provinces. The Treaty of Frankfurt marked the triumph of\r\nBismarck’s policy, which aimed at the incontestable hegemony of Prussia\r\nin Central Europe and the gradual Slavisation of the Balkan zones of\r\nAustria-Hungary. One recalls these features of Bismarck’s policy in\r\ntrying to understand the different international crises which took place\r\nin Europe from ’70 up to the bewildering and extremely painful situation\r\nof to-day. From ’70 onwards there were only remoter wars among the\r\npeoples of Eastern Europe, such as those between Russia and Turkey,\r\nSerbia and Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey, or wars in the colonies. There\r\nwas, in consequence, a widespread conviction that a European or world\r\nwar was no longer possible. The most diverse reasons were put forward to\r\nmaintain this argument.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Illusions and Sophisms._ It was suggested, for example, that the\r\nperfecting of the instruments for making war must destroy its\r\npossibility. Ridiculous! War has always been deadly. The perfecting of\r\narms is relative to the progress—technical, mechanical and military—of\r\nthe human race. In this respect the warlike machines of the ancient\r\nRomans are the equivalent of the mortars of 420 calibre. They are made\r\nwith the object of killing, and they do kill. The perfecting of\r\ninstruments of war is no hindrance to warlike instincts. It might have\r\nthe opposite effect.\r\n\r\nReliance was also placed on “human kindness” and other sentiments of\r\nhumanity, of brotherhood and love, which ought, it was maintained, to\r\nbind all the different branches of the species “man” together regardless\r\nof barriers of land or sea. Another illusion! It is very true that these\r\nfeelings of sympathy and brotherliness exist; our century has, in truth,\r\nseen the rapid multiplication of philanthropic works for the alleviation\r\nof the hardships both of men and of animals; but along with these\r\nimpulses exist others, profounder, higher and more vital. We should not\r\nexplain the universal phenomenon of war by attributing it to the\r\ncaprices of monarchs, race-hatred or economic rivalry; we must take into\r\naccount other feelings which each of us carries in his heart, and which\r\nmade Proudhon exclaim, with that perennial truth which hides beneath the\r\nmask of paradox, that war was of “divine origin.”\r\n\r\nIt was also maintained that the encouragement of closer international\r\nrelations—economic, artistic, intellectual, political and sporting—by\r\ncausing the peoples to become better acquainted, would have prevented\r\nthe outbreak of war among civilised nations. Norman Angell had founded\r\nhis book upon the impossibility of war, proving that all the nations\r\ninvolved—victors and vanquished alike—would have their economic life\r\ncompletely convulsed and ruined in consequence. Another illusion laid\r\nbare! Lack of observation. The purely economic man does not exist. The\r\nstory of the world is not merely a page of book-keeping; and material\r\ninterests—luckily—are not the only mainspring of human actions. It is\r\ntrue that international relations have multiplied; that there is, or\r\nwas, freer interchange—political and economic—between the peoples of the\r\ndifferent countries than there was a century ago. But parallel with this\r\nphenomenon is another, which is that the people, with the diffusion of\r\nculture and the formation of an economic system of a national type, tend\r\nto isolate themselves psychologically and morally.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Internationalism._ Side by side with the peaceful middle-class\r\nmovement, which is not worth examination, flourished another of an\r\ninternational character, that of the working classes. At the outbreak of\r\nwar this class, too, gave evidence of its inefficiency. The Germans, who\r\nought to have set the example, flocked as a man to the Kaiser’s banner.\r\nThe treachery of the Germans forced the Socialists of the other\r\ncountries to fall back upon the basis of nationality and the necessity\r\nof national defence. The German unity automatically determined the unity\r\nof the other countries. It is said, and justly, that international\r\nrelations are like love; it takes two to carry them on. Internationalism\r\nis ended; that which existed yesterday is dead, and it is impossible to\r\nforesee what form it will take to-morrow. Reality cannot be done away\r\nwith and cannot be ignored, and the reality is that millions and\r\nmillions of men, for the most part of the working classes, are standing\r\nopposite one another to-day on the blood-drenched battlefields of\r\nEurope. The neutrals, who shout themselves hoarse crying “Down with\r\nwar!” do not realise the grotesque cowardice contained in that cry\r\nto-day. It is irony of the most atrocious kind to shout “Down with war!”\r\nwhile men are fighting and dying in the trenches.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Real Situation._ Between the two groups, the Triple Entente and the\r\nAustro-German Alliance, Italy has remained—neutral. In the Triple\r\nEntente there is heroic Serbia, who has broken loose from the Austrian\r\nyoke; there is martyred Belgium, who refused to sell herself; there is\r\nrepublican France who has been attacked; there is democratic England;\r\nthere is autocratic Russia, though her foundations are undermined by\r\nrevolution. On the other side there is Austria, clerical and feudal, and\r\nGermany, militarist and aggressive. At the outbreak of war Italy\r\nproclaimed herself neutral. Was the “exception” contemplated in the\r\ntreaties? It seems as if it were so, especially in view of the recent\r\nrevelations made by Giolitti. If the neutrality of the Government meant\r\nindifference, the neutrality of the Socialists and the economic\r\norganisations had an entirely different character and significance. The\r\nSocialist neutrality intended a general strike in the case of alliance\r\nwith Austria; no practical opposition in the case of a war against her.\r\nA distinction was made, therefore, between one war and another. Further,\r\nthe classes were allowed to be called up.\r\n\r\nIf the Government had mobilised, all the Socialists would have found it\r\na natural and logical proceeding. They admitted, therefore, that a\r\nnation has the right and duty to defend itself by recourse to arms, in\r\ncase of attack from outside. Neutrality understood in this way had\r\nnecessarily to lead—with the progress of events, especially in\r\nBelgium—to the idea of intervention.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Bourgeoisie is Neutral._ It is controversial whether Italy has a\r\nbourgeoisie in the generally accepted sense of the word. Rather than the\r\nbourgeoisie and lower classes, there are rich and poor. In any case, it\r\nis untrue that the Italian middle classes are, at the moment, jingoist.\r\nOn the contrary they are neutral and desperately pacifist. The banking\r\nworld is neutral, the industrial classes have reorganised their\r\nbusiness, and the agrarian population, small and great, are pacifists by\r\ntradition and temperament; the political and academic middle classes are\r\nneutral. Look at the Senate! There are perhaps exceptions, young men who\r\ndo not wish to stagnate in the dead pool of neutrality; but the middle\r\nclasses, taken as a whole, are hostile to war and neutral. As a\r\nconclusive proof, compare the tone of the middle-class papers to-day\r\nwith that shown at the time of the Libyan campaign, and note the\r\ndifference. The trumpet-call which then sounded for war is muffled now.\r\nThe language of the middle-class Press is uncertain, wavering and\r\nmysterious, neutral in word but, in effect, in favour of the Allies.\r\nWhere are the trumpets that summoned us in the September of 1911? The\r\nsecret is out, and ought to make the Socialists, who are not stupid,\r\nstop and think. On the one side are all the conservative and stagnant\r\nelements, and on the other the revolutionary and the living forces of\r\nthe country. It is necessary to choose.\r\n\r\n\r\n_We want the War!_ But _we_ want the war and we want it _at once_. It is\r\nnot true that military preparation is lacking. What does this waiting\r\nfor the spring to come mean?\r\n\r\nSocialism ought not, and cannot, be against all wars because in that\r\ncase it would have to deny fifty years of history. Do you want to judge\r\nand condemn in the same breath the war in Tripoli and the result of the\r\nFrench Revolution of 1793? And Garibaldi? Is he, too, a jingoist? You\r\nmust distinguish between one war and another, as between one crime and\r\nanother, one case of bloodshed and another. Bovio said: “All the water\r\nin the sea would not suffice to remove the stain from the hands of Lady\r\nMacbeth, but a basinful would wash the blood from the hands of\r\nGaribaldi.”\r\n\r\nGuesde, in a congress of French Socialists held a few weeks before the\r\noutbreak of war, declared that, in case of a conflagration, the nation\r\nthat was most Socialist would be the victim of the nation that was\r\nleast. To prove this, notice the behaviour of the Italian Socialists.\r\nLook at them in Parliament. Treves lost time by quibbling. At one moment\r\nhe exclaimed, “We shall not deny the country.” In fact the country\r\ncannot be denied. One does not deny one’s mother, even if she does not\r\noffer one all her gifts, even if she does force one to earn one’s living\r\nin the alluring streets of the world. (Great applause.)\r\n\r\nTreves said more: “We shall not oppose a war of defence.” If this is\r\nadmitted, the necessity of arming ourselves is admitted. You will not\r\nopen the gates of Italy yet to the Austrian army, because they will come\r\nto pillage the houses and violate the women! I know it well. There are\r\nbase wretches who blame Belgium for defending herself. She might have\r\npocketed the money of the Germans, they say, and allowed them a free\r\npassage; while resistance meant laying herself open to the scientific\r\nand systematic destruction of her towns. But Belgium lives, and will\r\nlive, because she refused to sell herself ignobly. If she had done so,\r\nshe would be dead for all time. (Great applause, and cries of “Long live\r\nBelgium!” The cheering lasts for some minutes.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_The War of Defence._ When do you want to begin to defend yourselves?\r\nWhen the enemy’s knee is on your chest? Wouldn’t it be better to begin a\r\nlittle earlier? Wouldn’t it be better to begin to-day when it would not\r\ncost so much, rather than wait until to-morrow when it might be\r\ndisastrous? Do you wish to maintain a splendid isolation? But in that\r\ncase we must arm; arm and create a colossal militarism.\r\n\r\nThe Socialists, and I am still one, although an exasperated one, never\r\nbrought forward the question of irredentism, but left it to the\r\nRepublicans. We are in favour of a national war. But there are also\r\nreasons, purely socialist in character, which spur us on towards\r\nintervention.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Europe of To-morrow._ It is said that the Europe of to-morrow will\r\nnot be any different from the Europe of yesterday. This is the most\r\nabsurd and alarming hypothesis. If you accept it, there is some absolute\r\nmeaning for your neutrality. It is not worth while sacrificing oneself\r\nin order to leave things as they were before. But both mind and heart\r\nrefuse to believe that this spilling of blood over three continents will\r\nlead to nothing. Everything leads one to believe, on the contrary, that\r\nthe Europe of to-morrow will be profoundly transformed. Greater liberty\r\nor greater reaction? More or less militarism? Which of the two groups of\r\nPowers, by their victory, would assure us of better conditions of\r\nliberty for the working classes? There is no doubt about the answer. And\r\nin what way do you wish to assist in the triumph of the Triple Entente?\r\nPerhaps with articles in the papers and “orders of the day” in\r\ncommittee? Are these sentimental manifestations enough to raise up\r\nBelgium again? To relieve France? This France which bled for Europe in\r\nthe revolutions and wars from ’89 to ’71 and from ’71 to ’14? Do you\r\nthen offer to the France of the “Rights of Man” nothing but words?\r\n\r\n\r\n_Against Apathy._ Tell me—and this is the supreme reason for\r\nintervention—tell me, is it human, civilised, socialistic, to stop\r\nquietly at the window while blood is flowing in torrents, and to say, “I\r\nam not going to move, it does not matter to me a bit”? Can the formula\r\nof “sacred egoism” devised by the Hon. Salandra be accepted by the\r\nworking classes? No! I do not think so. The law of solidarity does not\r\nstop at economic competition; it goes beyond. Yesterday it was both fine\r\nand necessary to contribute in aid of struggling companions; but to-day\r\nthey ask you to shed your blood for them. They implore it. Intervention\r\nwill shorten the period of terrible carnage. That will be to the\r\nadvantage of all, even of the Germans, our enemies. Will you refuse this\r\nproof of solidarity? If you do, with what dignity will you, Italian\r\nproletarians, show yourselves abroad to-morrow? Do you not fear that\r\nyour German comrades will reject you, because you betrayed the Triple\r\nEntente? Do you not fear that those in France and Belgium, showing you\r\ntheir land still scarred by graves and trenches, and pointing out with\r\npride their ruined towns, will say to you: “Where were you, and what did\r\nyou do, O Italian Proletarians, when we fought desperately against the\r\nAustro-German militarism to free Europe from the incubus of the hegemony\r\nof the Kaiser?” In that day you will not know how to answer; in that day\r\nyou will be ashamed to be Italian, but it will be too late!\r\n\r\n\r\n_The People’s War._ Let us take up again the Italian traditions. The\r\npeople who want the war want it without delay. In two months’ time it\r\nmight be an act of brigandage; to-day it is a war to be fought with\r\ncourage and dignity.\r\n\r\nWar and Socialism are incompatible, understood in their universal sense,\r\nbut every epoch and every people has had its wars. Life is relative; the\r\nabsolute only exists in the cold and unfruitful abstract. Those who set\r\ntoo much store by their skins will not go into the trenches, and you\r\nwill not find them even in the streets in the day of battle. He who\r\nrefuses to fight to-day is an accomplice of the Kaiser, and a prop of\r\nthe tottering throne of Francis Joseph. Do you wish mechanical Germany,\r\nintoxicated by Bismarck, to be once more the free and unprejudiced\r\nGermany of the first half of last century? Do you wish for a German\r\nRepublic extending from the Rhine to the Vistula? Does the idea of the\r\nKaiser, a prisoner and banished to some remote island, make you laugh?\r\nGermany will only find her soul through defeat. With the defeat of\r\nGermany the new and brilliant spring will burst over Europe.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to act, to move, to fight and, if necessary, to die.\r\nNeutrals have never dominated events. They have always gone under. It is\r\nblood which moves the wheels of history! (Frantic bursts of applause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        “EITHER WAR OR THE END OF ITALY’S NAME AS A GREAT POWER”\r\n\r\n             Speech delivered at Milan, 25th January 1915.\r\n\r\n  The progress of Milanese, which is to say of Italian\r\n  interventionalism, thanks to the authority and the influence of the\r\n  Lombard metropolis, the throbbing heart of the country, begins with\r\n  the meeting held in the great hall of the Istituto Tecnico Carlo\r\n  Cattaneo. At this meeting there were present forty-five “fasci,”\r\n  called “fasci di azione rivoluzionaria,” formed almost entirely in\r\n  the principal regional and provincial centres. Among the most\r\n  notable supporters were a group of soldiers of the 61st and 62nd\r\n  Infantry, the poet Ceccardo Roccatagliata Ceccardi, and the old\r\n  Garibaldian patriot Ergisto Bezzi, called the “Ferruccio” of the\r\n  Trentino.\r\n\r\n\r\nI thank you for your greeting, and am happy and proud to be present at\r\nthis meeting which represents, perhaps, in these six months of a\r\nneutrality of commercialism and smuggling, branded with Socialism, a new\r\nfact of the utmost importance and significance.\r\n\r\nWhile listening to the reports which were made here, my mind carried me\r\nback to the first Congresses of the International, when the\r\nrepresentatives of the various sections of the different countries\r\nprepared written reports which gave full details as to the situations of\r\nthe respective peoples. This was a splendid means of coming to a closer\r\nunderstanding. I pass now to speak of the international state of\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nThe diplomatic and political situation cannot be spoken of without the\r\nmilitary. The military situation is stationary, although, to-day, it is\r\nclearly in favour of the Germans, who occupy the whole of Belgium, with\r\nthe exception of 880 square kilometres, who hold ten rich and populous\r\ndepartments of France, and a great part of Russian Poland. Besides, the\r\nrecent attack upon Dunkirk and the activity of the submarines and\r\ndirigibles show that the Germans are still full of fight, and wish to\r\ncarry the war on literally to the utmost limits of their powers of\r\nattack and defence. Thus the intervention of Italy is not late. I think\r\nthe right moment has come now, when the military situation hangs in the\r\nbalance. There is neither advance nor retreat on either side, for which\r\nreason it would be a good thing to decide the game by the introduction\r\nof a new factor, the intervention of Italy and Roumania.\r\n\r\nThe principal international events of this week have been the Berchtold\r\nresignations, the consideration of intervention by Roumania, and the\r\ntreaty of the Triple Entente for the regulation of Russia’s financial\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Russia._ It really seems to me that there was a moment of slackness in\r\nthe pursuit of the war on the part of Austria and Russia. It is enough\r\nto call to mind a short paragraph in an official Russian paper, the\r\n_Ruskoie Slovo_, in order to realise that there was a time when Russia\r\nwavered.\r\n\r\n“It is true,” says the paper, “that on the 4th September, Russia,\r\nFrance, England, Belgium and Serbia undertook not to make peace\r\nindividually; but this pledge brings with it the necessity of supporting\r\nthe expenses of war in common, especially now that Turkey has come to\r\nthe help of the Central Powers. Our treasury is empty. Where can we\r\nobtain that money which is more important than men? If England refuses,\r\nwe shall be obliged to end the war in any way convenient to Russia.”\r\nReally threatening words these, of which England, however, understood\r\nthe meaning, and immediately took steps to prevent their realisation by\r\nlaunching the loan of fifteen milliards in favour of Russia to be\r\nsubscribed to in the capitals of the Triple Entente. And, in fact,\r\nimmediately after the announcement of the loan the tone of the official\r\npapers changed, and there was no more talk of making a separate peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Austria._ There were other symptoms of restlessness in Austria.\r\nClearly, up to the present, Austria has been sacrificed the most. She\r\nhas lost Galicia and been defeated by the Russians and Serbs.\r\n\r\nIt may be then that the resignation of Berchtold is an indication that\r\nAustrian politics are taking a new direction. In what sense? I do not\r\nthink in the pacifist sense. Austria is tied to Germany, and Germany\r\nleans upon Austria and Hungary. Burian’s journey to the German General\r\nStaff was made, I think, with the object of obtaining military aid for\r\nHungary. Austria and Hungary are preparing themselves against Roumania,\r\nbecause this nation will probably intervene before Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Roumania._ Roumania has four million men concentrated in Transylvania\r\nunder the rule of Austria-Hungary; she is a young nation with a perfect\r\narmy of 500,000 men, and she will be obliged to end her hesitation,\r\nprobably owing to the fact that the Russians are at her frontier.\r\nNothing would embarrass the Roumanians as much as this, since they\r\nremember that in 1878 the Russians occupied Bessarabia. When the\r\nRussians, therefore, are in Transylvania, the intervention of Roumania\r\nwill be decided at once.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valona._ One fact that has a certain importance where Italy is\r\nconcerned is the occupation of Valona, which has come about in curious\r\ncircumstances with the occupation of Sasseno, and the landing of the\r\nmarines before the Bersaglieri. I do not think that there are really\r\nrebels in Albania; and I think that Italy will stop at Valona. I do not\r\nthink either that Valona will run any serious risk, because the\r\nAlbanians have rifles but no artillery. Albania does not exist in the\r\ntrue sense of the word, as the Albanians are divided both by race and\r\ntribe, and I do not think that an organised movement is to be feared.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Switzerland._ One point that we must take into consideration is the\r\nposition of Switzerland—a point, to my mind, rather obscure. It is true\r\nthat we can feel, to a certain extent, reassured by the fact that the\r\nPresident of Switzerland at the moment is an Italian. But without doubt\r\na restless state of mind prevails among the German element there. The\r\nvoice of race calls louder than the voice of political union; the German\r\nSwiss lay down laws; they circulate pamphlets which say “Let us remain\r\nSwiss”; they go in search of the Swiss spirit, but I think that it would\r\nbe difficult to find it. In any case, it is certain that they make acid\r\ncomments on the articles in the _Popolo d’Italia_! Taken as a whole it\r\ncan be said that a Pan-German movement has developed in German\r\nSwitzerland, which manifests open sympathy towards the Central Powers.\r\n\r\nZahn, a Swiss writer, in this way published an ode and sent money to the\r\nGerman Red Cross. A political personality of Basel sent information\r\nabout the troops and the Swiss defence to the _Frankfurter Zeitung_. The\r\nnovelist Schapfer, of Basel, went to Berlin to extol Germany and to sing\r\n_Deutschland über Alles_ at a public meeting. The journalist Schappner\r\nadvocated in the _Neues Deutschland_ that Switzerland should abandon her\r\nneutral position in order to help Germany, and have as compensation\r\nUpper Savoy, the Gex region and a part of Franche-Comté so that she\r\nmight form an advanced post of Germany towards the south, declaring at\r\nthe same time an alliance with Austria-Hungary which would enable\r\nSwitzerland to extend her boundaries also towards Italy.\r\n\r\nThe _Neue Zurcher Nachrichten_ has even gone to the extent of taunting\r\nBelgium with her unhappy fate, saying that the neutrality of Belgium\r\nwould have been violated by her own Government, and calling her the\r\nbetrayer of Germany, and saying that Germany had every right to punish\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThese are all documents which are worth while knowing about, because\r\nthey denote a state of mind that might have a surprise in store for us.\r\nSwitzerland is made up of twenty-four cantons, in one of which the\r\nItalian language is spoken; but I don’t think that much reliance can be\r\nplaced on that fact. For the rest, I know that the General Staff\r\npreoccupies itself a good deal with the possibility that, either through\r\nlove or fear, Switzerland will allow the Kaiser’s troops to pass through\r\nSwiss territory, in which case they would then find themselves at once\r\nin Lombardy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Dilemma of Italy._ This meeting, therefore, asks for the\r\nrepudiation of the Treaty of the Triple Alliance as the first step to\r\nmobilisation and war. Otherwise, if the treaty is still in force, you\r\ncan see how it can be interpreted in any sense. At first it bound us to\r\nintervene on the side of Austria and Germany, and we were taxed with\r\nbeing traitors when we declared ourselves neutral. To-day it proves that\r\nit is our duty to remain neutral. Treaties then are interpreted\r\naccording to the letter, according to the spirit and according to the\r\nconvenience of those who have to interpret them! Necessity demands,\r\ntherefore, the explicit repudiation of the Treaty of the Triple\r\nAlliance. Perhaps this can be made the _casus belli_. We are not\r\ndiplomats, but it is certain that if Italy repudiates the Treaty of the\r\nTriple Alliance, Germany will ask for explanations, and if, at the same\r\ntime, there was mobilisation against Austria and Germany, we should be\r\nable to reach the stage in which a solution by arms would be forced upon\r\nus. For us the _casus belli_ was magnificent and solemn; it was that\r\ncreated by the violation of the neutrality of Belgium. Italy ought to\r\nintervene in the name of _jus gentium_, in the name of her own national\r\nsecurity. She has not been able to do so then; but now we must decide.\r\n“Either war, or the end of our name as a great power.” Let us build\r\ngambling-houses and hotels and grow fat. A people can have this ideal\r\nalso, which is shared by the lower zoological species!\r\n\r\nIn reality the German working classes have embraced the cause of\r\nPrussian militarism, and so, my friends, the chief reason for remaining\r\nneutral falls to the ground. You Italian Socialists are preparing to\r\ncommit the same crime of which you accuse the German Socialists. We, in\r\nthe meantime, question the right of the German Socialists to call\r\nthemselves Socialists any more. The International compact is only of\r\nvalue when it is signed and respected by all the contracting parties.\r\nSince the Germans are the first to have broken it, the Italians are no\r\nlonger under obligation to hold by a contract which might mean their\r\nruin.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact, however, that Italy is “still bound to the Triple\r\nAlliance.” This Government of ours is pusillanimous, because the\r\nrepudiation of the Triple Alliance does not mean a declaration of war or\r\neven mobilisation. But, meanwhile, this would prove that the Italian\r\npeople vindicate their right to independence of action in this period of\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Revolutionary War._ To say that we are causing a revolution in\r\norder to obtain war, is to say something which we cannot maintain. We\r\nhave not the strength. We find ourselves face to face with formidable\r\ncoalitions, but the _fasci_ of action have this object, to create that\r\nstate of mind which will impose war upon the country.\r\n\r\nTo-morrow, if Italy does not make war, a revolutionary position will be\r\ninevitably decided, and discontent will spring up everywhere. Those same\r\nmen who to-day are in favour of neutrality, when they feel themselves\r\nhumiliated as men and Italians, will ask the responsible powers to\r\naccount for it, and then will be our chance. Then we shall have our war.\r\nThen we shall say to the dominant classes: “You have not proved\r\nyourselves capable of fulfilling your task; you have deceived us and\r\ndestroyed our aspirations. Your first care should have been the\r\ncompletion of the unity of the country, and you have ignored it. You\r\nhave been warned about it by democracy in general and by the Republican\r\nParty particularly.” This will be a case which will surely end in\r\ncondemnation; in condemnation which cannot be other than capital. And\r\nthen perhaps we shall issue from this harassing period of history. Every\r\nday we feel that there is something in Italy which does not work, that\r\nthere is a cog missing in the gear, or a wheel that does not go round.\r\nThe country is young, but its institutions are old; and when—if I may be\r\nallowed to quote once more from Karl Marx, the old Pangermanist—a\r\nconflict between new forces and old institutions begins to shape itself,\r\nthat means that the new wine cannot any longer be kept in the old skins,\r\nor the inevitable will occur. The old forces of the political and social\r\nlife of Italy will fall into fragments. (Loud applause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               “TO THE COMPLETE VANQUISHING OF THE HUNS”\r\n\r\n       Speech delivered at Sesto San Giovanni, 1st December 1917.\r\n\r\n  After the Caporetto disaster the patriotic organisations of Milan\r\n  had consolidated their union, previously undermined by the opponents\r\n  of war, who, thanks to the leniency of the Government, had been able\r\n  to work in the interest of the enemy. They developed the existing\r\n  sphere of propaganda, advocating resistance within the country. One\r\n  of the centres most infected by neutralist opposition was\r\n  undoubtedly Sesto San Giovanni, a large borough of the working\r\n  classes at the gates of Milan, completely controlled by\r\n  Social-Communist administration.\r\n\r\n  Mussolini, having just left the military hospital, where he had been\r\n  lying ill as a result of many wounds received when a “bersagliere”\r\n  of the 11th Regiment, spoke in this hostile citadel as only he could\r\n  speak; and it is certainly beyond question that his frank and\r\n  incisive eloquence was mainly instrumental in dispersing the bitter\r\n  anti-war feelings fomented by stubborn and impudent Socialist\r\n  neutralism.\r\n\r\n\r\nWorkmen and citizens! The other evening, after three years’ silence, I\r\nspoke to the audience of the Scala; an imposing audience and a large\r\nhall; but I prefer this friendly gathering of workmen and soldiers,\r\nbecause, in spite of everything, I am, and shall always remain, one with\r\nthe masses which produce and work, and the implacable adversary of every\r\nparasite.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The International Illusion._ I am here to talk to you of the war, and\r\nto remind you of an article, which some of you will still remember, in\r\nwhich, in a certain degree, I foresaw this truce. “A truce of arms” I\r\ncalled it then, and I repeat these words to-day. When one speaks of war,\r\none must do so with a clear conscience and without all those useless\r\nornaments of speech typical of an old, artificial style of literature.\r\nWe must remember that while we stand together here to think of them, the\r\nbest among our men, our brothers, your sons and your husbands are\r\nconsuming themselves, suffering and perhaps dying for us, for our\r\ncountry and for our civilisation! We wished for the war, it is true, but\r\nbecause the arrogance of other men imposed it upon us. We had\r\nentertained the illusion that it was possible to realise the\r\ninternational dream among the peoples, but, while we were sincerely\r\nputting our faith in this beautiful chimera, the German\r\n“Internationals,” with Bebel at their head, were declaring themselves to\r\nbe first Germans, and afterwards Socialists! And in the International\r\nCongresses the Germans always systematically refused to bind themselves\r\nto decisive action with the Socialists of other countries, under the\r\nspecious pretext that the retrograde constitution of their country did\r\nnot allow them, without jeopardising their organisation, to conclude\r\ninternational agreements. They held too much by their organisations, by\r\ntheir hundred and one deputies and by the fat and swollen purse of\r\nmarks, which is the only thing which has been saved from German\r\nSocialism. (Loud applause.)\r\n\r\nWhile Germany was preparing for war by organising formidable means of\r\ndominion and massacre, nobody in England, France, Italy or Russia\r\ndreamed of the imminence of the terrible scourge.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The True Germany._ We had a very wrong idea of Germany. We only knew\r\nthe Germany of the flaxen-haired Gretchens and of home-sick novels, and\r\nnot that of Von Bernhardi, Harden and the Hohenzollerns.\r\n\r\nIt was Germany who wanted the war. Harden said so in an ill-considered\r\noutburst of sincerity. The Socialists, who claimed more land for the\r\nexpansion of the German people, wanted it; spectacled professors\r\nincapable of synthesis, but terrible in analysis, prepared it; the\r\nmilitary caste imposed it. The pretext for the unchaining of these\r\nforces was soon found. Two revolver shots in 1914; some bombs thrown;\r\ntwo imperial corpses hurried away in a court coach were the pretext. The\r\nwar, for which the Central Powers were prepared, blazed up on all sides.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Socialist Intervention._ We Socialists who were in favour of\r\nintervention advocated war, because we divined that it contained within\r\nit the seeds of revolution. It is not the first instance of\r\nrevolutionary war. There were the Napoleonic wars, the war of 1870, the\r\nenterprises of Garibaldi, in which, had we lived in those days, we\r\nshould have joined in the same spirit and the same faith.\r\n\r\nKarl Marx, too, was a jingoist. In 1855 he wrote that Germany would have\r\nbeen obliged to declare war against Russia; and in 1870 he said of the\r\nFrench: “They must be defeated! They will never be sufficiently beaten.”\r\nAnd when in 1871 the Socialists of France, with Latin ingenuousness,\r\nafter declaring the Republic, sent a passionate appeal to the Germans\r\nfor peace, Karl Marx said: “These imbeciles of Frenchmen claim that for\r\ntheir rag of a republic we should renounce all the advantages of this\r\nwar.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_One does not deny one’s Country._ It is possible to remain a Socialist\r\nand be in favour of certain wars. When the country is in danger, it is\r\nnot possible to remain pacifist. A man cannot ignore his country any\r\nmore than a tree can ignore the earth which provides it with sustenance.\r\n(Applause.) Our people have understood it, and you, who carry in your\r\nveins some drops of the warrior-blood of those men of Legnano who drove\r\naway Barbarossa, of the people of the Cinque Giornate, join with me\r\nto-day in inciting our soldiers to free our land from the shame of\r\nservitude. (Applause.) To deny one’s country, especially in a critical\r\nhour of her existence, is to deny one’s mother!\r\n\r\nIt was thought that the soldiers’ strike would bring peace. But, when\r\nour soldiers found that the enemy, instead of throwing down their\r\nrifles, mounted cannons and field-guns, instead of fraternising,\r\nmassacred old men, women and children, and far from returning to their\r\nown country, advanced into ours, they only waited until a large enough\r\nriver divided them from the adversary to place before them once again\r\nthe impassable barrier of the Italian forces. (Loud applause.)\r\n\r\nOur set-back is not due to fear of the Germans. The victors of eleven\r\nbattles, the soldiers of the Carso, Bainsizza, Monte Santo, Cucco and of\r\nSabotino do not fear spiked helmets. The armies of all the combatant\r\ncountries have had moments of bewilderment, but not one recovered itself\r\nas quickly as we have. After only one week of retreat, our troops faced\r\nthe enemy again and forced them back.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Resolute Resistance._ We have skirted the abyss; we might have been\r\nlost, but we have saved ourselves. While the Germans were hoping for\r\nstill further revolution, the soldiers re-established the force of\r\nresistance which had been weakened; and now at the front the only\r\nfraternity is that of rifle shots. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nWhen the storm is passed we shall be proud of having done our duty.\r\nWilson, convinced pacifist, was drawn into the war by an elevated\r\nhumanitarian motive, which made him feel that to prolong the war was an\r\nact of intolerable complicity with the Germans, and he gives us an\r\nexample.\r\n\r\nThe war will end with our victory; but in order to win, you, workmen,\r\nmust produce more. We must have guns, shells, rifles and bombs in great\r\nquantities. Arms and munitions, at this moment, represent our salvation.\r\nTo-morrow, when our factories again produce ploughs and spades and\r\ninstruments for agriculture, we shall have the joy of a duty done.\r\nTo-day, and until the barbarians are defeated for ever, instruments of\r\nwar must increase in number under the impulse of your decisive will to\r\nwin. (Loud applause and demonstration of affection and sympathy.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           “NO TURNING BACK!”\r\n\r\n     Speech delivered in the Augusteo at Rome, 24th February 1918.\r\n\r\n  The speech delivered at the Augusteo in Rome may be included among\r\n  those made by the most fervent patriots to rouse the country to a\r\n  resolute effort after the Caporetto disaster. It was a summons to\r\n  resistance, and a strong indictment against the heads of the\r\n  Government in Italy which was responsible for the moral collapse\r\n  which took place in the Army, due to the evil influences of\r\n  blackmail and neutralist Parliamentarism at work in the country. The\r\n  salient feature of this meeting was the leaving of the hall by the\r\n  generals representing the “Corpo d’Armata” and the Ministry of War.\r\n  But it was entirely owing to this meeting of exasperated patriots\r\n  that the general policy of the then Prime Minister ceased to be\r\n  lenient to the enemy’s sympathisers and that active resistance paved\r\n  the way to the victory of the country in arms.\r\n\r\n\r\nI wonder if there is anyone among you who remembers a meeting in favour\r\nof intervention in the war, that we held three years ago in one of the\r\nsquares in Rome? We were dispersed by the police, but we were in the\r\nright. We moved on, and history moved on with us.\r\n\r\nThree cities created history. But it does not matter. It is always the\r\ncities which create history; the villages are content to endure it. We,\r\nafter three years of war, notwithstanding Caporetto, solemnly and truly\r\nreaffirm all that was deep, pure and immortal in those days in May.\r\n\r\nRemember! It was just in the May of 1915 that Italy was not afraid of\r\nknowing how to live, because she was not afraid of knowing how to die!\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Mistake of May._ But we made a great mistake then, that we have\r\nsince paid for bitterly. We, who wished for the war, ought to have taken\r\ncommand of the situation. (Loud applause.) The Italian people—which is\r\nnot the plebeian crowd which gets drunk in taverns, for twenty centuries\r\nof history have not civilised us for nothing—the Italian people had,\r\neven then, a vague apprehension of the dangers which threatened its\r\nmission.\r\n\r\nIn the May of 1915 the nation as a whole presented a marvellous\r\nconcentration of human force. We men of ’84, when we forded the Upper\r\nIsonzo, thought that it was never again to be crossed by the Germans.\r\nWhen we gained the other side, with one accord we shouted: “Long live\r\nItaly!” (Loud applause from the whole assembly, who echo the cry.) It\r\nwas fine human material which we handed over to those men who carried on\r\nwar as if it were a tiresome task more tedious than the rest. We gave it\r\nover—for a war which, after twenty centuries of history, was the first\r\nwar of the Italian people—to men who did not understand it; to men who\r\nrepresented the past; to bureaucrats who have spilled much too much ink\r\nover the trials and sufferings of the people.\r\n\r\nBut we are here to say to you: Gentlemen! the Germans are on the Piave,\r\nthe Germans have broken down one gate of the Veneto and are in the\r\nprocess of breaking down the other. The moment has come to see if our\r\nhearts are made of steel. (Enthusiastic applause.)\r\n\r\nI know these soldiers, because, as a simple soldier myself, I have lived\r\namong them, leading the life of a simple soldier. I have seen them under\r\nall the different aspects of military life. I have seen them in the\r\nbarracks, in the hard, bare military transports while going to the\r\nfront, in the trenches, in the dugouts under ceaseless bombardment when\r\nthe shells rained down death; I have seen them when every heart has\r\nstopped beating, awaiting the command of the officer, “Over the top”; I\r\nknow them, these sons of Italy, and I tell you, they have not been\r\nmerely soldiers, they have been saints and martyrs! (Loud burst of\r\napplause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Causes of Caporetto._ How then did Caporetto happen? Let us search\r\nour consciences courageously as a great people.\r\n\r\nAh! yes! At first, it may have had a military reason, not later. Later\r\nwe were face to face with a gigantic hallucination. (Applause.) Great\r\nwords were flashed across the horizon. The formulæ of “salvation” had\r\ncome from Russia, and from Rome came a fierce outcry against the war,\r\nsaying that it was “a useless massacre.” You cannot conceive the\r\nprofound disturbance this outcry caused in the minds of the multitude.\r\nAnd, as if that were not enough, without anyone having the courage to\r\ntake summary proceedings against the authors, another sacrilegious\r\nmessage came from Parliament: “No more trenches next winter.” And, it is\r\ntrue, we are not any longer in the trenches beyond the Isonzo; we are on\r\n_this_ side of the Piave.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Justice for All._ All this was the result of a falsehood that lay at\r\nthe bottom of our national life. The words “political liberty” had been\r\nsaid. Ah! liberty to betray, to murder the country, to pour out more\r\nblood, as said the man in France. (General applause. Cries of “Long live\r\nClémenceau!”) This political liberty is a paradox. It is criminal to\r\nthink that men are requisitioned, dressed, armed and sent to be killed,\r\nwhilst every liberty of speech and power of protest is denied them; that\r\nthey are terribly punished for the slightest act or word not in keeping\r\nwith given orders, while at the same time, behind, in the secret\r\nmeeting-places, in the club-houses of brutalised drunkards, plans are\r\nallowed to be matured and words to be spoken which are death to the war.\r\n(Loud general applause.)\r\n\r\nBut did you not feel, after 24th October, that there was a great change\r\nin us, both collectively and individually? Did you not feel that the\r\nvultures had torn away the flesh and fixed their claws in the open\r\nwounds? Did you not understand that we were going back to ’66? Did you\r\nnot take into account the danger that the military system of ’66 would\r\nbe accompanied by the same diplomatic manœuvring which we have not yet\r\nexpiated? One does not deny one’s country, one conquers it! (Warm\r\napplause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Example of Russia._ Take a lesson from what has happened in Russia.\r\nThe Latin sages used to say that Nature does not work by sudden leaps. I\r\nthink, on the contrary, that she does sometimes. But in Russia they\r\nwanted to make things move too fast. They got rid of Czarism in order to\r\nform the democratic republic of Rodzianko and Miliukoff. That was in\r\nitself a big step, and I pass over the intermediate action of the Grand\r\nDuke Michael. But, not satisfied with this republic, they wished to\r\nbecome more Socialist and called for Kerensky. Kerensky went, because he\r\nwas a mere figurehead—(Laughter.)—and now there are other people who\r\nstill want to make things move too fast. But now the Germans, under the\r\npretence of a future pseudo-democracy, have unmasked their brutal and\r\nbarbarous annexationist projects. At Petrograd, it is said, all citizens\r\nmust dig trenches, and those falling under suspicion of vagabondage or\r\nespionage will be shot immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n_An Iron Policy._ But meanwhile the Germans advance, and I think they\r\nare impelled by three motives: military, political and dynastic. I think\r\nthat the Hohenzollerns propose to put the Romanoffs back on the throne.\r\nWell! I don’t care if they do! As the Russian people have proved that\r\nthey don’t know how to live under a régime of liberty, let them live in\r\nslavery. But, in the meantime, the defection of the Russians increases\r\nour task.\r\n\r\nIt is not the moment to bewail idly or to follow a weak policy. I seek\r\nferocious men! I want the fierce man who possesses energy—the energy to\r\nsmash, the inexorable determination to punish and to strike without\r\nhesitation, and the higher the position of the culprit the better. (Loud\r\napplause from the assembly which understands the allusion.)\r\n\r\nYou send the simple soldier, burdened with a family, full of cares, and\r\nwhom you have never taught anything about the country, to court-martial\r\nbecause he has disobeyed some order. If you put this soldier with his\r\nback against the wall, I approve of what you do, because I am a believer\r\nin rigid discipline. But you must not have two kinds of law. If there is\r\na general who infringes the Sacchi decree, strike him too. If there is a\r\ndeputy who, after the experience of Caporetto, says again that war is a\r\n“useless massacre,” I tell you that he, too, ought to be arrested and\r\npunished! (Ovation.)\r\n\r\nWhoever has been to the front and lived in the trenches, knows what an\r\neffect the reading of certain speeches and Parliamentary reports had\r\nupon the minds of the soldiers. The poor man in the trenches asked\r\nhimself: “Why must I suffer and die, if they are still discussing at\r\nRome whether there ought to be war, if those who are at the head of\r\naffairs there do not know whether or not it is a good thing to be\r\nfighting?” That is deplorable and criminal talk, gentlemen! And now,\r\neven after Caporetto, after defeat, irresponsible people are allowed to\r\nmake public anti-war demonstrations. (Loud applause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ghosts!_ After Caporetto men showed themselves again whom we thought to\r\nhave swept away for ever. But we have driven them back into their holes,\r\nbecause we are still on our legs.\r\n\r\nYes! Many of our comrades have not come back from the Carso and from\r\namong the Alps. But we carry their sacred memory in our hearts. I think\r\nof the indescribable torture of mind of those men of the Third Armata,\r\nwhen they had to abandon the Carso. I think they must have cried out,\r\n“For what reason, as the result of what unexpected catastrophe, are we\r\nforced to abandon these rocks?” Because in the end one loves the tracks,\r\nthe stones, the trenches and the dugouts among which men have lived and\r\nsuffered. We love the Carso, this heap of stones dotted with little\r\ncrosses which mark the graves of those fallen in the cause of the\r\nliberty of our country. (Applause.) We love the Carso, from which we can\r\nview the coveted coast-line, the riviera of our Trieste. We still carry,\r\nalive and splendid, the torch of the dead; the torch of those who fell\r\nin the face of the enemy. And we are not moved by motives of gain. We\r\nwant clear and explicit recognition of the fact that we have done our\r\nduty. And we find ourselves still in the breach, that we may tell this\r\npeople, in case they have forgotten, that there is no turning back.\r\nThere is no possibility of choosing. Worry your brains as you will,\r\nthere is nothing else to be done, nothing else can be thought of!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Until Victory._ The game is such that we must go on, because there is\r\nno other solution than this; victory or defeat! And it is the life or\r\ndeath of the nation that is at stake. Also those who assumed power with\r\ndifferent ideas, with the intention of mending the situation, have had\r\nto change their minds. There is no turning back; we must win!\r\n\r\nThe warning has come from Russia. The Russian rulers tried to turn back\r\nand make peace. They have talked for days, weeks and months without\r\ncoming to any conclusions, because if Massimalism had sent lawyers more\r\nor less smart, Prussia had sent armed generals who from time to time\r\ntapped the pavement with their swords so that German rights might be the\r\nbetter understood. Then they accepted peace. But Prussia, thirsty for\r\nland, the Prussia of the Hohenzollerns, insatiable and implacable,\r\nmarches into Russia and occupies territory.\r\n\r\nIf there is anybody to-day who does not wish for peace, who prevents\r\ntalk of peace, who wants to continue the war, you must not seek him\r\namong the people, but at Berlin in the company of Hindenburg and\r\nLudendorff. These are the enemies of mankind and to these one does not\r\nkneel. No! The Latin race holds itself upright! (Ovation.)\r\n\r\nWe who desired the war and make it our boast that we did so, we who do\r\nnot go humbly soliciting electoral divisions, we shall not follow the\r\ncowardly demagogic example of those who wish to ingratiate themselves\r\nwith the people. Democracy does not signify descent. It means ascent. It\r\nmeans raising up those who are down. And so for all the sacred and\r\nyouthful blood that has been shed, and that we have not forgotten, and\r\nfor the sake of all that is still to be shed, let us renew the solemn\r\npact of our faith in the certainty of victory.\r\n\r\nNo! Italy will not die, because Italy is immortal! (Frantic applause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE FATAL VICTORY\r\n\r\n    Speech delivered at the Teatro Comunale, Bologna, 24th May 1918.\r\n\r\n  On this occasion the principal speaker was the Editor of _Il Popolo\r\n  d’Italia_, who had recovered his physical efficiency after severe\r\n  wounds received on the Carso, and had a real influence in securing\r\n  victory because of the encouragement he gave to the spirit of\r\n  resistance within the country.\r\n\r\n  Bologna was then a stronghold of the opponents of war, on account of\r\n  the net of political and syndicalist organisation stretching\r\n  throughout the province, and of Socialist supremacy in the communes\r\n  and dependent administrations. It is, unfortunately, well known that\r\n  the State had by then ceased exercising any authority other than\r\n  merely formal in this province.\r\n\r\n  A mark of Socialist power, which proves also the profound\r\n  anti-national feeling of the defeated politicians who to-day stammer\r\n  so many lying excuses, is offered by the absolute prohibition of\r\n  manifestations calculated to glorify the Italian Army.\r\n\r\n  Mussolini’s speech at the “Comunale” temporarily reunited the sane\r\n  sections of Bologna to the rest of Italy, then in great anxiety for\r\n  her fate and future.\r\n\r\n\r\nCombatants and Citizens! Will you allow me to pass over without\r\nunnecessary delay the polemics which preceded my coming to this city?\r\nIf, as says our great poet Carducci, “one does not seek for butterflies\r\nbeneath the arch of Titus,” one does not seek for them either beneath\r\nthe arches of this, our ancient and magnificent town of Bologna,\r\nespecially as one would probably not find butterflies at all, but bats\r\ndazed and frightened by this glorious May sunshine.\r\n\r\nThe form of my speech will not surprise you. In those days, three years\r\nago, all the Italy that was conscious of life and possessed of\r\nwill-power, the only Italy which has a right to transform her chaotic\r\nsuccession of events into history, burned with an intense ardour—our\r\nardour. I have noticed now for some time that there are opportunists who\r\nare trying to open a door for eventual responsibilities and who are\r\ncarefully and laboriously cataloguing the reasons why Italy could not\r\nremain neutral.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Destiny and Will._ Very well! I admit that there has been fatality, I\r\nadmit this compulsion, which was the result of a number of causes which\r\nit is useless to dwell upon, but I add that at a certain moment we\r\nimprinted the mark of our will upon this concatenation of events, and\r\nto-day, after three years, we are not penitent of what we have done. We\r\nleave this weak, spiritual attitude to those who seek applause, seats in\r\nParliament, and personal satisfaction; those who thoroughly despise, as\r\nI do, all parliamenteering and demagogism, are far away from all this.\r\n\r\nWhat Machiavelli says in chapter vi. of the _Principe_, about those who,\r\nby their own inherent qualities, attained the position of princes,\r\nMoses, Cyrus, Romulus and Theseus, can be applied not only to the\r\nindividual, but to the nation. “And examining,” says the Florentine\r\nSecretary, “their lives and actions, one does not see that they had\r\nother fortune than that of the opportunity which gave them the material\r\nand enabled them to shape it as seemed best to them; and without that\r\nopportunity the virtue of their souls would have been lost, and without\r\nthat virtue the opportunity would have come in vain.”\r\n\r\nAs to the Italian people in that glorious May, it can be said that\r\nwithout the opportunity of the war the virtue of our people would have\r\nbeen lost; but without this virtue the opportunity of the war would have\r\ncome in vain.\r\n\r\nI have found an echo of the thought of Machiavelli in the book of\r\nMaeterlinck, the great Belgian poet, the poet who, perhaps, more than\r\nany of his contemporaries, has given expression to the most delicate and\r\ncomplex movements of the human soul. Maeterlinck in his book _Wisdom and\r\nDestiny_ admits the existence of a mechanical, external fate, but says\r\nthat a human being can react against it. “An event in itself,” he says\r\nin chapter viii. of this book, “is pure water which the fountain pours\r\nout over us, and which has not generally in itself either taste, colour\r\nor perfume. It becomes beautiful or sad, sweet or bitter, life-giving or\r\nmortal, according to the soul which receives it. Thousands of\r\nadventures, all of which seem to contain the seeds of heroism,\r\ncontinually happen to those who surround us, whilst no heroism arises\r\nwhen the adventure is over. But Christ met a group of children in his\r\npath, an adulteress, a Samaritan, and three times in succession humanity\r\nrose to divine heights.” The war has been as a jet of pure water for our\r\nnation. It has been deadly for Spain, for instance, but life-giving to\r\nus. We desired it. We chose. Before making our choice we argued and\r\nstruggled, and the struggle sometimes assumed the aspect of violence;\r\nbut we won, and now we are proud of those days, and are glad to think\r\nthat the memory of the crowds which filled the streets and squares of\r\nour cities disturbs those who were defeated and those who even to-day,\r\nby the most insidious means, try to extinguish the sacred flame and the\r\nfaith of our people. They accepted this war as one accepts a heavy\r\nburden, and their leader, followed by the curses of the people,\r\nwithdrew, like an old feudal lord, to his remote native country, and we\r\ncan only wish that he will always remain there.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Enough of Old Age!_ But, as I am never tired of repeating, we young men\r\nmade one fatal mistake then, which we have paid for bitterly; we\r\nentrusted this ardent youth of ours to the most grievous old age. When I\r\nsay old age, I do not establish merely a chronological fact. I think\r\nsome people are born old, that there are those at twenty who are in a\r\nmental and physical decline, whereas some men—the marvellous Tiger of\r\nFrance, for instance—at seventy have all the vibration and fire of\r\nvirile youth. I speak of the old men who are old men, who are behind the\r\ntimes, who are encumbrances. They neither understood nor realised the\r\nfundamental truths underlying the war.\r\n\r\nBesides the people, the meaning of this war in its historical aspect and\r\ndevelopment has been perceived by two classes of men: the poets and the\r\nindustrial world. By the poets, because with their extreme sensitiveness\r\nthey grasp truths which remain half veiled to the ordinary person; and\r\nby the industrial world, because it understands that this war is a war\r\nof machines. Between the two let us also put the journalists, who have\r\nenough of the poet in them not to belong to the industrial world, and\r\nare enough of the industrial world not to be poets. And the journalists\r\nhave often forestalled the Government. I speak of the great journalists\r\nwho keep their ears open, on the alert to catch vibrations from the\r\noutside world. The journalist has sometimes foreseen what those\r\nresponsible, alas! have recognised too late.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Quality versus Quantity._ This war has so far been one of quantity.\r\nNow, it is realised that the masses do not beat the masses, an army does\r\nnot vanquish an army, quantity does not overcome quantity. The problem\r\nmust be faced from another point of view—that of quality. This war,\r\nwhich began by being tremendously democratic, is now tending to become\r\naristocratic. Soldiers are becoming warriors. A selection is being made\r\nfrom the armed mass. The struggle, now carried on almost exclusively in\r\nthe air, has lost the characteristics it had in 1914.\r\n\r\nThe first novelist who foresaw the problems of the war of quality was\r\nWells. Read his book _The War on Three Fronts_. It is in this book that\r\nhe advised the exploitation of the “quality” of the Latin and\r\nAnglo-Saxon races. Because, whereas the Germans only work in close\r\nformation, only give good results through the automatism of the masses,\r\nthe Latin feels the joy of personal audacity, the fascination of risk,\r\nand has the taste for adventure; which taste, says Wells, is limited in\r\nGermany to the descendants of the feudal nobility, while with us it is\r\nto be found also among the people.\r\n\r\nAnother truth which those responsible realised late was that, in order\r\nto win the armies, the people must be won, that is to say, that the\r\narmies must be taken in the rear. This would be difficult where Germany\r\nwas concerned, as she is ethnically, politically and morally compact.\r\nBut we are face to face with an enemy against whom we could have acted\r\nin this way from the very first. We ought to have penetrated the mosaic\r\nof the Austrian State.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Great People._ Among the peoples who cannot be taken in the rear by\r\nsurprise, is ours. My praise is sincere. The people in the trenches are\r\ngreat, and those who have not fought are great. For deficiency you must\r\nlook among those old men of whom I spoke just now.\r\n\r\nI have lived among our brave soldiers in the trenches and listened to\r\nthem talking in their little groups. I have seen them during their bad\r\ntimes and in epic moments of enthusiasm. And when, after the sad 24th\r\nOctober, there was a certain distrust of them, I would not allow it,\r\nbecause it seemed to me impossible that the soldiers, who had won\r\nbattles in circumstances more difficult than those prevailing in any\r\nother theatre of war, had become all at once weak cowards, who fled at\r\nthe mere crackling of a machine-gun. And it was not so, because if it\r\nhad been, no river would have stopped the invading forces, and if we\r\nstopped them on the Piave, it means we could have resisted also on the\r\nIsonzo. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nI was reading in the train last night a book of poems written in the\r\ntrenches by a Captain Arturo Arpigati. The literature of the war is the\r\nonly readable literature, but it must have been written by men who have\r\nreally been at the front. In this verse I recognised my one-time\r\nfellow-soldiers, the humble and great soldiers of our war. Here it is:\r\n\r\n                Col vecchio suo magico sguardo\r\n                il Dovere, nume d’acciaio\r\n                gli inconsci anche soggioga.\r\n                benché ne balbettino il nome,\r\n                ecco, essi, la madre difendono\r\n                ed è la madre di tutti;\r\n                e sono essi la Guerra,\r\n                e sono essi la Fronte,\r\n                sono essi la Vittoria;\r\n                dai loro elmetti ferrei\r\n                spicca il volo la gloria:\r\n                essi martiri e santi,\r\n                sono l’eroica Patria, essi. I Fanti![2]\r\n\r\nBut the highest praise of the people in arms is contained in the\r\nthousand bulletins of the Supreme Command. The unarmed also deserve\r\npraise, both those in cities—inevitably nervous and restless by reason\r\nof the association of thousands of human beings and the contact of\r\nthousands of temperaments—and those in the country. From the Valle\r\nPadana to the Tavoliere delle Puglie, from the vine-clad hills of\r\nMontferrat to the plains of the Conca d’Oro, the houses of the peasants\r\nstand empty, and with the houses the stables. The women have seen the\r\nfather and the son depart together, the thoughtful territorial of over\r\nforty and the adventurous youth. It is useless to expect from the humble\r\npeople of the proletariat a highly developed sense of nationality. It\r\ncannot possess what we have never done anything to cultivate. From the\r\npeople who have exchanged the spade for the gun we simply ask for\r\nobedience, and the Italian people, the people of the country and of the\r\nfactories, obey. A sad episode, some signs of restlessness are not\r\nenough to spoil this picture. It had been said that we should not hold\r\nout six months; that at the announcement of the names of the dead the\r\nfamilies would rebel; that the sight of the maimed at the street corners\r\nwould rouse the people to action. Three years have now passed—three long\r\nyears. The mothers of the fallen take a sacred pride in their grief. The\r\nmaimed do not ask to be called “glorious,” and refuse to be pitied. Food\r\nis scarce, but the people still resist. The troop trains go to the front\r\nadorned with flowers as in the May of 1915. The dignity and peace in the\r\ntowns and in the country is simply marvellous! The national crisis,\r\nwhich lasted from August to October of 1917, and which is summed up in\r\nthe two names of Turin and Caporetto, has been in a certain sense\r\nsalutary. It was the repercussion of the great crisis which hurled\r\nRussia into the abyss.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  As of old, Duty, of the steel hand, enchains even the ignorant by the\r\n  magic of her glance. While as yet they can barely stutter her name,\r\n  lo! they defend their mother, who is the mother of all.\r\n\r\n  And they are the war, and they are the battle front, and they are the\r\n  victory. Glory is reflected from their steel helmets.\r\n\r\n  They, the soldiers, are the martyrs and saints and the heroic country.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Russian Tragedy._ Was there any definite motive in the Leninist\r\npolicy which led Russia to make the “painful, forced and shameful Peace\r\nof Brest”? Yes! there was. The massimalists really believe in the\r\npossibility of revolution by “contagion.” They hoped to infect the\r\nGermans with the massimalist bacillus. They did not succeed; Germany is\r\nrefractory. The very “minoritaries” are far from proclaiming themselves\r\nBolshevists. And more, these “minoritaries,” who ought to represent the\r\nfermenting yeast, are continually losing ground. In three elections\r\nthere have been three overwhelming defeats. The “majoritaries” triumph.\r\nThey are the same now as in the August of 1914, accomplices of\r\nPangermanism. They want to win. After Brest-Litowsk the Socialists lay\r\nlow; after the Peace of Bucharest they kept silence.\r\n\r\nWe have seen what have been the results in Russia of the Leninist\r\ngospel, we have seen how the German Socialists, who accepted “neither\r\nannexations nor indemnities and the right of the people to decide their\r\nown fate,” have interpreted this doctrine. The Germans took possession\r\nof 540,000 square kilometres of territory in Russia with a population of\r\nfifty-five millions; then they went on to Roumania and plundered her. If\r\nthe Peace of Brest-Litowsk was shameful for Russia, the Peace of\r\nBucharest was not. The Roumanians were taken in the rear, and could not\r\nresist.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Cicerin, the Commissioner of Foreign Affairs, made the\r\nwireless work. A cynic might remark that if the Roman Republic had a\r\nCicero in a critical hour of her history, Russia has a Cicerin, whom,\r\ncontrary to the former, nobody takes seriously, because it is impossible\r\nto take seriously those who do not know how to take up arms in the\r\ndefence of their own rights.\r\n\r\nThe Russian experiment has helped us enormously, both from the socialist\r\nand the political points of view. It has opened many eyes which had\r\npersistently remained closed. It must be realised that if Germany wins,\r\ncomplete and certain ruin awaits us. Germany has not changed her\r\nfundamental instincts. They are the same as those which Tacitus\r\ndescribes to perfection in his _Germania_ in these words: “The Germans\r\ndo not live in villages, but in separate houses, set wide apart the\r\nbetter to protect them against fire. To shield themselves from the cold,\r\nthey live in underground dwellings covered with manure or clothe\r\nthemselves in the skins of small animals, of which they have a great\r\nnumber. Strong in war, but persistent drunkards and gamblers, armed with\r\nspears and well supplied with horses, they prefer to gain wealth, when\r\nit suits them, by violence rather than by the working of their lands.”\r\n\r\nIn his _De Vita Julii Agricolæ_ this Roman writer notes a contrast\r\nbetween the Germans and the Britons nineteen centuries ago which is\r\nstill the same to-day, that is, that while the Britons fight for the\r\ndefence of their country and their homes, the Germans fight for avarice\r\nand lust. These same tribes, driven once to Legnano, have resumed their\r\nmarch beyond the Rhine and are preparing once more to take up the\r\noffensive against us. But the “lust” of which Kuhlmann speaks will not\r\ncarry the Germans beyond the Piave.\r\n\r\n\r\n_We are on our Feet._ According to German calculations, the Italian\r\nnation, as the result of Caporetto, ought to fall into a state of chaos.\r\nInstead, it is on its feet. What vicissitudes may not this last phase of\r\nthe war bring with it? Will Germany, who has not been able to beat us by\r\nourselves, beat the formidable combination of nations which faces her?\r\n\r\nWe are one with France, whose soldiers have performed wonders of\r\nheroism. And this France, which we knew so little, because we had looked\r\nfor her only in the cabarets of Montmartre, not frequented by Frenchmen\r\nat all but by adventurers from all over the world, has written for us\r\nthe most splendid pages of heroic deeds. She has known how to rid\r\nherself of insidious dangers, to give the death-blow to the plotters of\r\ntreachery, both great and small, and to make the rifles of the\r\nexecutionary squadrons crackle, a sound which, to one who loves his\r\ncountry, is sweeter than the harmonies of a great opera. Also we, in\r\nItaly, must act inexorably where traitors are concerned, if we are to\r\ndefend our soldiers from attack from behind. Where the existence of the\r\nnation and of millions of men is involved, there cannot and must not be\r\na moment’s hesitation about sacrificing the lives of one, ten or a\r\nhundred men.\r\n\r\nWe are one with England, who repeats the words of Nelson, “England\r\nexpects that every man this day will do his duty.”\r\n\r\nAnd we are one with the United States. This is Internationalism, the\r\nreal, true and lasting Internationalism, even if it has not got the\r\nformulas, dogmas and chrism of Socialism made official. It is in the\r\ntrenches, where soldiers of different nationalities have crossed six\r\nthousand leagues of ocean to come and die in Europe.\r\n\r\nYou must allow me to be optimistic about the outcome of the war. We\r\nshall win because the United States cannot lose, England cannot lose,\r\nFrance cannot lose. The United States has a population of 110 millions;\r\none single levy can produce a million recruits. America, like England,\r\nknows that the wealth of society is at stake.\r\n\r\nAs long as we are in this company there is no danger of a ruinous peace.\r\nNot to arrive at the goal of peace means to be crushed; but when we\r\narrive there, we, too, can look the enemy in the face and say that we,\r\ntoo, small, despised people, army of mandolinists, have held out to the\r\nend, wept, suffered, but resisted, and have thus the right to a just and\r\nlasting peace!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Convalescence._ I am an optimist, and see the Italy of to-morrow\r\nthrough rose-coloured spectacles. Enough of the Italy of the\r\nhotel-keeper, goal of the idle with their odious Baedekers in their\r\nhands; enough of dusting old plaster-work; we are and we wish to be a\r\nnation of producers.\r\n\r\nWe are a people who will expand without aiming at conquest. We shall\r\ngain the world’s respect by means of our industries and our work. It\r\nwill be the august name of Rome which will still guide our forces in the\r\nAdriatic, the Gulf of the Mediterranean, and in the Mediterranean, which\r\nforms the communication between three continents.\r\n\r\nThose who have been wounded know what convalescence means. There comes a\r\nday when the surgeon no longer takes his ruthless but life-giving knife\r\nfrom the tray, no longer tortures the suffering flesh. The danger of\r\ninfection is over, and you feel yourself re-born. A second youth begins.\r\nThings, men, the voice of a woman, the caress of a child, the flowering\r\nof a tree—everything gives you the ineffable sensation of a return. New\r\nblood surges through your veins, and fills you with a feverish desire to\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe Italian people too will have its convalescence, and it will be a\r\ncompetition for reconstruction after destruction. The flag of the\r\ndisabled is a symbol of a change in their moral and spiritual life. Just\r\nthink that certain rascals thought to take advantage of them for their\r\ninfamous speculations. But the disabled answered: “We will not lend\r\nourselves to this shameful game, we do not intend to accept from your\r\ncharity and sympathy help which would humiliate us.” And they do not\r\ncurse their fate, they do not complain, even if they are without an arm\r\nor a leg; even those who have lost the divine light of their eyes hold\r\ntheir peace. In vain the enemy hoped to profit by the state of mind of\r\nthese people. They reply to this by saying that all they had they gave\r\nfor their country, and to-day they do not wish to be a burden upon her,\r\nand so they work and train themselves, and give further proof of their\r\ndevotion to the sacred cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Returning Battalions._ I no longer see relegated to some far future\r\ntime the day upon which the banners of the disabled will precede the\r\ntorn and glorious standards of the regiments. And around the standards\r\nwill be collected the veterans and the people. And there will be the\r\nshadow of our dead, from those who fell on the Alps to those who were\r\nburied beyond the Isonzo, from those who stormed Gorizia to those who\r\nwere mowed down between Hermada and the mysterious Timavo, or upon the\r\nbanks of the Piave. All this sacred phalanx we sum up in three names:\r\nCesare Battisti, who wished deliberately to face martyrdom, and who was\r\nnever so noble as when he offered his neck to the Hapsburg executioner;\r\nGiacomo Venezian, who left the austere halls of your Athenæum in order\r\nto go and meet his death upon the road to Trieste; and Filippo\r\nCorridoni, born of the people, a fighter for the people, and who died\r\nfor the people on the first rocky ridges of the Carso.\r\n\r\nThe returning battalions will move with the slow and measured tread of\r\nthose who have lived and suffered much and who have seen innumerable\r\nothers suffer and die. They will say, we shall say:\r\n\r\n“Here upon the track which leads back to the harvest field, here in the\r\nfactory which now forges the instruments of peace, here in the\r\ntumultuous city and the silent country, now that the duty was done and\r\nthe goal reached, let us set up the symbol of our new right. Away with\r\nshadows! We, the survivors—we, the returned, vindicate our right to\r\ngovern Italy, not to her destruction and decay, but in order to lead her\r\never higher, ever on, to make her—in thought and deed—worthy to take her\r\nplace among the great nations which will build up the civilisation of\r\nthe world to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   “IN HONOUR OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE”\r\n\r\n        Speech delivered at Milan on the occasion of the popular\r\n                    demonstration of 8th April 1918.\r\n\r\n  The exaggerated welcome lavished upon President Wilson during his\r\n  visit to Italy is well known; and of all cities Milan accorded him\r\n  the most generous hospitality. Benito Mussolini, who on that\r\n  occasion was specially entrusted with the task of addressing the\r\n  President of the United States on behalf of the Lombard Association\r\n  of Journalists, had prepared the mind of the Milanese eight months\r\n  before, by a speech delivered in Piazza Cordusio, extolling the\r\n  generous and brotherly effort of the great and vigorous American\r\n  people.\r\n\r\n\r\nCitizens! Time does not allow long speeches. I do not speak of time by\r\nthe clock, but of historical time, which for some few weeks has\r\nquickened its beat. To-day throughout Italy demonstrations are taking\r\nplace worthy of this unique moment in the history of humanity.\r\n(Applause.)\r\n\r\nThe people of Bergamo go to Pontida to renew the vows made by the League\r\nof the Lombard Communes seven centuries ago, when they took the field\r\nagainst Barbarossa; at Rome an imposing demonstration is in progress\r\nbeneath the shadow of the imperial walls of the Coliseum; while here the\r\npeople of Milan, by their numbers and enthusiasm, express the keen\r\nsympathy they feel for the noble American Democracy. It was a year ago\r\nto-day that America, having loyally waited for the Germans to come to\r\ntheir senses, unsheathed her sword and joined the battle. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nSix thousand leagues of ocean have not prevented the United States from\r\nfulfilling her definite duty. The importance of her intervention does\r\nnot consist only in the fact that America gives us, and will give us,\r\nmen, ammunition and provisions. There is something deeper in the\r\nintimate reassurance given us as men and civilised people, as America\r\nwould never have embraced our cause if she had not been firmly convinced\r\nof the right and justice of it. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nCitizens! It is for us a source of pride and satisfaction to be\r\nassociated with twenty-three other nations in this war against Prussian\r\nmilitarism. But it must also be a satisfaction for the United States to\r\nfight side by side with a great and powerful England which does not\r\ntremble before the varying chances of war; beside a France which is\r\nalmost sublime in her heroism—(Applause.)—and beside the new Italy,\r\nwhich has now definitely taken her place in the world struggle.\r\n(Applause.)\r\n\r\nAs Italy discovered America, so America and the rest of the New World\r\nmust discover Italy, not only in the great towns, pulsating with life\r\nand humming with industry, but also in the country, where the humble\r\nlabourers wait with quiet resignation for the dawn of a victorious and\r\njust peace to appear on the horizon.\r\n\r\nThere cannot be anybody now, even the most ignorant, who can sincerely\r\nbelieve that Germany did not want the war, and that Germany does not\r\nwish to continue the war in order that she may turn the world into a lot\r\nof horrible Prussian barracks. (Applause and cries of “Death to\r\nGermany!”)\r\n\r\nThis is our conviction, and also the conviction of the Americans, a\r\ngreat people numbering more than a hundred million, who have a vast\r\nwealth at their command and who have already submitted themselves to the\r\nmagnificent discipline of war.\r\n\r\nAn old story comes into my mind. When Christopher Columbus turned the\r\nprows of his three poor little ships towards unknown lands and far-off\r\nshores, there were those who called him mad and moonstruck; and\r\ncertainly sometimes during those three months of wandering a sense of\r\ndespair invaded the hearts of those men lost in the midst of the unknown\r\nocean. But one morning the crew up aloft saw something new upon the\r\nhorizon. It was a dark, vague line. They shouted “Land! Land!” and three\r\nmonths of misery were forgotten in one delirious moment.\r\n\r\nThe day will come when from our blood-stained trenches will arise\r\nanother such cry; the cry of “Victory! Victory!” And there will be the\r\nright and just peace for all the nations!\r\n\r\nCitizens! On behalf of the Committee of the Wounded and Disabled\r\nSoldiers, I thank you for your solemn demonstration and I ask you to\r\njoin with me in giving three cheers for America and for Italy. (Warm\r\napplause and cheers.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS\r\n\r\n             Speech delivered at Milan, 20th October 1918.\r\n\r\n  Immediately after the end of the war a group of journalists and\r\n  politicians, belonging for the most part to the Republican and\r\n  Radical democracy, took the initiative in a movement supporting the\r\n  future work of the League of Nations. Later, however, this\r\n  initiative had to be abandoned by those who were loyal to victory,\r\n  because it seemed clear to them that the pseudo-idealism of the\r\n  Allies would prejudice the legitimate interests of the Italian\r\n  nation. The following speech, however, shows clearly the generosity\r\n  of Italian ex-soldiers disappointed by the realism of other\r\n  countries’ national aspirations.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Executive Committee of the Wounded and Disabled Soldiers has asked\r\nme to speak on the order of the day expressing support of the idea of\r\nthe League of Nations, which, already preconceived in Italy, is now so\r\nnobly advocated by President Wilson, and which proclaims the\r\ndetermination of the Italian people to co-operate effectively in\r\nbringing about its realisation. I shall do so shortly, as the question\r\nis not new, but is already understood throughout the country.\r\n\r\nThe disabled soldiers have taken the initiative, and it is significant,\r\nas only those who have suffered most from the war have the right to say\r\nwhat the peace ought to be, not those who have wilfully opposed it and\r\nwould have led us to defeat or—not wishing that the people should suffer\r\ndefeat—to continuous war.\r\n\r\nThis is the hour particularly suited to the discussion of these\r\nproblems. Already a League of Nations seems to be in the process of\r\nrealisation; in the trenches the different peoples are mixed up and are\r\nassociating with each other. The humblest peasant, dreaming of return to\r\nhis native village after the hard experiences of the trenches, has\r\nwidened his spiritual horizon and, for a time, breathes a world\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nIn the other nations, the question has already come under discussion in\r\nthe papers, the universities and the Parliaments. It could be said that\r\nItaly was behindhand, but we might reply that in a certain sense we have\r\nforestalled the others. There have been epochs in our history when\r\nItalian thought has been almost too universal, but I think perhaps at\r\nthose times the universality of our literature, our philosophy, our art,\r\nof our spirit, in fact, was our highest and noblest title to greatness.\r\n\r\nBut, without returning to the Middle Ages, two men of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, Cattaneo and Mazzini, prove that Italian thought led, and that\r\nthe other nations followed the furrow we were the first to plough.\r\n\r\nThis war may be divided into two periods: the first, from the outbreak\r\nof hostilities to the American intervention; the second, from the\r\nAmerican intervention up to to-day. In the first, the war has a national\r\nand territorial character. The names of Metz, Trento, Fiume and Zara\r\noccur frequently, and can be said to sum up our aims. The territorial\r\nquestions come first. The systemised jurisdiction of the world is not\r\nyet spoken of; the war is world-wide in its direct and indirect\r\nrepercussion in as far as England has already made use of her colonies,\r\nsince Australians and Indians came to fight in Europe, but it is not yet\r\nworld-wide in its extension and aims. The second period began with the\r\nApril of ’17. Already, in the first period, English politicians had\r\nbegun to disregard the territorial problems; but this process was\r\nshaped, hurried on and definitely settled by the intervention of\r\nAmerica. But in my modest opinion, the national and territorial\r\nquestions must not be underrated too much; that would be to play into\r\nthe hands of the anti-war agitators and the Germans. These are questions\r\nof justice. It is a good thing to remember that Wilson, in all his\r\nmessages, though he certainly made a transposition of values, never\r\nfailed to establish that vindication of national rights, without which\r\nthe settlement of Europe and the world of to-morrow in general could\r\nhave no definite meaning.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of a League of Nations we must take into account certain\r\ndispositions. Cesare Lombroso used to divide men into two categories:\r\nthe “misoneists” and the “philoneists”: the misoneists, who accept the\r\nrevealed truths, lean upon them and sleep upon them; the philoneists,\r\nwho are restless, impatient spirits and as necessary to the world as the\r\nwheels and shafts to a cart. For the first the so-called kingdom of the\r\nimpossible has always extensive boundaries, but the war has enormously\r\nreduced that kingdom. That which yesterday was a misty, fantastic\r\nUtopia, to-day has become reality and fact.\r\n\r\nOur enemies talk too much about the League of Nations. There are furious\r\n“Wilsonites” of the latest kind in Austria and in Germany. Now I must\r\nsay that seeing this kind of people bleating like lambs makes a certain\r\nimpression on me. (The simile is that of a Republican German paper\r\nprinted at Berne.) They are the same who burnt the cities of Belgium,\r\nwho sank ships without leaving a trace, or gave orders to that effect;\r\nthey are the same who carried off men and women in their retreat. They\r\nshout “League of Nations,” but we cannot be mixed up with them. There is\r\nevidently an underlying motive. But they will be unmasked by the\r\nvictorious armies of the Entente.\r\n\r\nSome people say, Would not this League of Nations be a substitute for\r\nvictory? No! on the other hand, it presupposes victory. Wilson has\r\ntalked of absolute victory.\r\n\r\nIt is said, in a Socialist review, that a League of Nations is\r\nimpossible if the Allies gain a military victory, because the desire for\r\nrevenge would lurk in the depths of the German mind. Now there are three\r\nhypotheses as regards the way in which the conflict may end. The first\r\nis the victory of the enemy, and this has already fallen through. If\r\nthis had come about, there would not have been a League of Nations, but\r\na master at Berlin and slaves in the rest of Europe, which would then\r\nhave become a German colony. The second is a war which ends in neither\r\nvictory nor defeat; and this is the most repugnant and inhuman of all,\r\nas it would leave all the problems unsolved, and give a peace which was\r\nonly a truce. The third is the solution which is now shaping itself\r\ngloriously upon the horizon—our victory. There is no danger of the\r\nspirit of revenge being fostered by the Germans to-morrow, because we\r\nallies in war would remain allies in peace. Germany will find herself\r\nface to face with the same coalition which defeated her, and will have\r\nto resign herself to the _fait accompli_. The League of Nations will be\r\nformed without Germany, against Germany, or with Germany when she has\r\nexpiated her crime by being defeated.\r\n\r\nSome people say: “Does it not seem very dangerous to go back to\r\nuniversality, after the experiences of the past?” Ernest Renan must have\r\nbeen up against this problem when he wrote: “The nation which entertains\r\nproblems of the religious and social order is always weak. Every country\r\nwhich dreams of a kingdom of God, lives on general ideas and carries out\r\nwork in the interests of the universe, sacrifices through this its own\r\nparticular destiny and weakens and destroys its efficiency as a\r\nterritorial power. It was thus with Judea, Greece and Italy. It will,\r\nperhaps, be thus with France.”\r\n\r\nRenan was a great man, but his prophecy has not been fulfilled. France\r\nduring the nineteenth century entertained universal ideas, but with the\r\noutbreak of war she recovered her national spirit. Internationalism may\r\nbe dangerous when a single nation advocates it, but to-day all the\r\nnations of the world are seeking each other, in order to lay the\r\nfoundations of a lasting and pacific means of co-existence. Besides\r\nthis, the racial, historical and moral sense of every nation has been\r\ndeveloped by the war. It is not a paradox but a reality that the war,\r\nwhile it has made us find ourselves and exalted the national spirit,\r\nhas, at the same time, carried us beyond those boundaries which we have\r\ndefended and conquered.\r\n\r\nThere is no danger of the levelling of the national spirit as the result\r\nof contact with other nations. Solid foundations are needed for national\r\nunity, and for this reason the condition of the working classes must be\r\nraised. No nation can become greater in which there are enormous masses\r\ncondemned to the conditions of life of prehistoric humanity.\r\n\r\nAnother paradox of this war is that the nations fighting against the\r\nGermans have not yet formed a peace alliance. The peace manifesto to the\r\npeoples of the world ought to have come from Versailles. This could\r\nhelp, among other things, to make the German crisis more acute. It has\r\nnot been done yet. The people intuitively felt the necessity. Sometimes\r\ntruths are arrived at more quickly by intuition than by reasoning, and\r\nthe people felt that that was the path to follow. And we are upon that\r\npath to-day. Not long ago Clémenceau said that the liberation of France\r\nmust be the liberation of humanity.\r\n\r\nIt is true that to put the idea of the League of Nations into practice\r\nwould present difficulties, especially at first. According to me the\r\nproblems which will have to be faced and solved are of a political,\r\neconomic, military and colonial order. In a month’s time you will have\r\nreports upon these subjects, and I do not wish to tire you with hasty\r\nanticipations.\r\n\r\nWe have arrived at a decisive point in history. While we are gathered\r\nhere the battle is raging; there are millions and millions of men who\r\nare fighting their last fight. Let us swear that all this has not been\r\nin vain, but that these sacrifices must mark a new phase in the history\r\nof humanity. Let us say to ourselves that all that can be tried will be\r\ntried, in order to make the purple flower of liberty spring from the\r\nblood shed in the cause of freedom, and that justice shall reign\r\nsovereign over all the peoples of the renewed world!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       IN CELEBRATION OF VICTORY\r\n\r\n   Speech delivered at Milan, 11th November 1918, before the Monument\r\n                       of the “Cinque Giornate.”\r\n\r\n  Milan, notwithstanding its multi-coloured local Socialism, had ever\r\n  remained the burning heart of the country’s resistance and spent\r\n  herself lavishly for the war. On the morrow of the memorable day of\r\n  Vittorio Veneto she gave herself up to unrestrained manifestations\r\n  of patriotic joy.\r\n\r\n  Benito Mussolini—the ardent advocate of intervention in the\r\n  harassing times gone by, the indomitable fighter in the Carso\r\n  trenches, and the fervent advocate of resistance in the hour in\r\n  which the enemy’s friends were crying for “peace at any\r\n  price”—Benito Mussolini may well be considered as one of the\r\n  principal artificers of victory.\r\n\r\n  The people of Milan felt this in the triumphant rejoicings and the\r\n  Editor of _Il Popolo d’Italia_ was acclaimed by public gratitude for\r\n  his part in the union of hearts.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy brothers of the trenches, Citizens! I have never before felt my\r\ninefficiency as an orator as deeply as I do now in the face of the\r\ngreatness of the events and your memorable and imposing manifestation.\r\nWhat can I say to you, when this manifestation is already more than a\r\nspeech, a hymn—more than a hymn, an epos?\r\n\r\nWe have arrived at this day after many hardships. I see here, gathered\r\nround the monument of the Cinque Giornate, which is the altar of Milan,\r\nthose who fought first and last, those of the trenches who are the\r\nsurvivors of the sacrifice of devotion, who marked with their blood the\r\ndestinies of the country, and the disabled who feel themselves no longer\r\nmaimed since Italy has become great. I see beside them the refugees, who\r\nwill soon return to their lands and deserted hearths. I remember what I\r\nsaid last year; we must love these brothers of ours, warm them by our\r\nfiresides, and still more in our hearts. And I see the people of Milan\r\njoined together like all the Italian people in a superb act of love.\r\n\r\nHow many different events in the course of a year! Do you remember these\r\ndays a year ago? Do you remember last year at the Scala when we swore\r\nthat the Germans should not pass the Piave? And they did not pass, and\r\nthe then line of resistance became afterwards the line of advance\r\ntowards victory. Even in the darkest hours I did not despair, and paid\r\nhomage to the fighters. We saw in those days the first “poilus” and\r\n“tommies”; it was the Entente coming to cement the Alliance in our\r\ntrenches. After a year of faith and sacrifice has come victory.\r\n\r\nWe think with gratitude of the fine leaders who led us on to victory,\r\nbut also, still more, of the anonymous mass of soldiers, our marvellous\r\npeople, who resisted the invasion on the Piave, and from the Piave\r\nsprang forward to rout the enemy.\r\n\r\nRemember it here—here where we held the first meeting for war—here, with\r\nFilippo Corridoni. (The crowd give a prolonged ovation to the memory of\r\nFilippo Corridoni.) We wanted the war, because we were obliged to want\r\nit, because it was imposed by historical necessity. To-day we have\r\nrealised all our ideals; we have secured our national aims; the Italian\r\nflag to-day flies from the Brenner to Trieste and Fiume and Italian\r\nZara. We did not know then that there were Italian infantry on the other\r\nside of the Adriatic. Now, in all the cities and villages on the eastern\r\nshore, the Italians have planted the flag of their country, because that\r\nshore, which is Italian, must remain Italian.\r\n\r\nWe have also accomplished the international aims of our war. When we\r\nsaid, four years ago, that the red flag must wave over the castle at\r\nPotsdam, the dream appeared madness. To-day the Kaiser has fled, and\r\nwith the passing of the Hohenzollerns passes militarism.\r\n\r\nThe most magnificent political panorama which history records unfolds\r\nitself before the eyes of the astonished world. Empires, kingdoms and\r\nautocracies crumble like castles built with cards. Austria no longer\r\nexists; to-morrow there will no longer be Imperialist Germany. We, with\r\nthe sacrifice of our blood, have given the German people liberty, while\r\nthe German people have made a holocaust of their blood in order to\r\ndeliver us over to the chain of imperialism and military slavery. Upon\r\nthe ruins of the old world is outlined the dream of a League of Nations.\r\n\r\nVictory must also see the realisation of the aims of war within the\r\ncountry—that is to say, the redemption of labour. From now onwards the\r\nItalian people must be the arbiters of their destinies, and labour must\r\nbe redeemed from speculation and misery.\r\n\r\nCitizens! At Trento there is the statue of Dante with his hand\r\noutstretched towards the Alps. It seemed before that the reproach of the\r\ngreat poet:\r\n\r\n               Ahi! serva Italia, di dolore ostello,\r\n               Nave senza nocchiero in gran tempesta,[3]\r\n\r\nrang out admonishing the country. But Italy to-day is no longer a slave,\r\nshe is the mistress of herself and her future. She is no longer a\r\nrudderless ship in a storm, because a glorious horizon has been opened\r\nup by her victory.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n                Alas! Slave Italy, the home of all griefs,\r\n                A ship without rudder in a great storm.\r\n\r\nAnd the people are the rudder of this ship, which, between three seas\r\nand three continents, sails serenely and securely towards the port of\r\nsupreme justice in the light of the redeemed humanity of to-morrow.\r\n(Prolonged applause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PART III\r\n\r\n             MUSSOLINI THE “FASCISTA FRIEND OF THE PEOPLE”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     WORKMEN’S RIGHTS AFTER THE WAR\r\n\r\n    Speech delivered 20th March 1919 before the workmen of Dalmine.\r\n\r\n  The episode of Syndicalist strife, during which the present Prime\r\n  Minister addressed a crowded meeting of ironworkers, is often\r\n  recalled as a kind of reproach by Italian Socialists. They would\r\n  like to attribute to Mussolini and to Fascista Syndicalism the\r\n  initial responsibility for that dark period in our national life\r\n  which had its dramatic expression in the occupation of the\r\n  factories.\r\n\r\n  But the methods of protest adopted by the patriotic Italian workmen\r\n  of Dalmine (Bergamo), although primitive on account of the moral\r\n  immaturity and technical incapacity of the proletariat at that time,\r\n  were provoked by the insolence of employers. For the rest, the\r\n  protest was kept within the bounds of correct and calm expression.\r\n\r\n  A significant item in the story, which reveals the state of mind of\r\n  the workers, is the following: tricolour flags, which were then\r\n  frequently insulted by organisations of workmen under the thumb of\r\n  the Socialist Party, flew from all chimney-tops during the\r\n  occupation of Dalmine works, while in the workshops below the work\r\n  itself throbbed cheerfully and briskly.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have often asked myself if, after the four years of terrible though\r\nvictorious war in which our bodies and minds have been engaged, the\r\nmasses of the people would return to move in the same old tracks as\r\nbefore, or whether they would have the courage to change their\r\ndirection. Dalmine has answered. The order of the day voted by you on\r\nMonday is a document of enormous historical importance, which will and\r\nmust give a general direction to the line taken by all Italian labour.\r\n\r\nThe intrinsic significance of your action is clearly set forth in the\r\norder of the day. You have acted on the grounds of class, but you have\r\nnot forgotten the nation. You have spoken for the Italian people, and\r\nnot only for those of your class of metal-workers. In the immediate\r\ninterests of your category you might have caused a strike in the old\r\nstyle, the negative and destructive style; but, thinking of the\r\ninterests of the people, you have inaugurated the creative strike which\r\ndoes not interrupt production. You could not deny the nation after\r\nhaving fought for her, when half a million men have given their lives\r\nfor her. The nation, for which this sacrifice has been made, cannot be\r\ndenied, because she is a glorious and victorious reality. You are not\r\nthe poor, the humiliated, the rejected, as the old rhetorical sayings of\r\nthe Socialists would have you be; you are the producers, and it is in\r\nthis capacity that you vindicate your right to treat the industrial\r\nowners as equals. You are teaching some of them, especially those who\r\nhave ignored all that has occurred in the world in the last four years,\r\nthat for the figure of the old industrial magnate, odious and grasping,\r\nmust be substituted that of the industrial captain.\r\n\r\nYou have not been able to prove your capacity for creation, on account\r\nof shortness of time and of the conditions made for you by the\r\nindustrial leaders; but you have proved your good-will, and I tell you\r\nthat you are on the right road, because you are freed from your\r\nprotectors, and have chosen from among yourselves the men who are to\r\ndirect you and represent you, and to them only you have entrusted the\r\nguardianship of your rights.\r\n\r\nThe future of the proletariat is a question of will-power and capacity;\r\nnot of will-power only and not of capacity only, but of both together.\r\nYou are free from the yoke of political intrigue. Your applause tells me\r\nthat it is true. I am proud of having fought for intervention. If it\r\nwere necessary, I would carve in capital letters upon my forehead, so\r\nthat all cowards might see, that I was among those in the glorious May\r\nof ’15 who demanded that the shame of the neutral Italy of those days\r\nshould cease.\r\n\r\nNow that the war is over, I, who have been in the trenches, and\r\nwitnessed daily for long months the revelation, in every sense, of the\r\nvalour of the sons of Italy—I say, to-day, that it is necessary to go\r\nout and meet the returning workers and those, who were no shirkers, who\r\nlaboured in the factories with minds open to the necessities of the\r\nhour. And those who do not see this necessity, involved by the new order\r\nof things, or deny it, are either stupid or deluded.\r\n\r\nI have never asked, and to-day less than ever, anything from you or\r\nanybody. And so I have no anxiety or misgivings as to the effect that my\r\nwords will have upon you. I tell you that your action has been original,\r\nand is worthy, on account of the motives of sympathy which inspired it.\r\n\r\nAnother observation. Upon the flagstaff of your building you have run up\r\nyour flag, which is the tricolour, and around it you have fought your\r\nbattle. You have done well. The national flag is not merely a rag, even\r\nif it has been dragged in the mud by the bourgeoisie, or by their\r\nrepresentatives; it still remains the symbol of the sacrifice of\r\nthousands and thousands of men. For its sake from 1821 to 1918\r\ninnumerable bands of men suffered privation, imprisonment and the\r\ngallows. Around it during these years, while it was the rallying-point\r\nof the nation, was shed the blood of the flower of our youth, of our\r\nsons and brothers. It seems to me that I have said enough.\r\n\r\nAs regards your rights, which are just and sacred, I am with you. I have\r\nalways distinguished the mass which works from the party which assumes\r\nthe right, nobody knows why, of representing it. I have sympathy with\r\nall the working classes, not excluding the “General Federation of\r\nLabour,” though I feel myself more drawn towards the “Italian Union of\r\nWorkmen.” But I say that I shall not cease fighting against the party\r\nwhich during the war was the instrument of the Kaiser. They wish at your\r\nexpense to try their monkey-like experiments, which are only an\r\nimitation of Russia. But you will succeed, sooner or later, in\r\nexercising essential functions in modern society, though the political\r\ndabblers of the bourgeoisie and semi-bourgeoisie must not make\r\nstepping-stones of your aspirations so as to arrive at winning their\r\nlittle games.\r\n\r\nThey may have said what they liked to you about me, I do not mind. I am\r\nan individualist, who does not seek companions on his journey. I find\r\nthem, but I do not seek them. While this despicable speculation of the\r\njackals rages, you, obscure workers of Dalmine, have cleared the way. It\r\nis labour which speaks in you, and not an idiotic dogma or an intolerant\r\ncreed. It is that labour which in the trenches established its right to\r\nbe no longer considered as labour, necessarily accompanied by poverty\r\nand despair, because it must bring joy, pride in creation, and the\r\nconquest of free men in the great and free country of Italy within and\r\nwithout her boundaries. (Enthusiastic applause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    SACRIFICE, WORK, AND PRODUCTION\r\n\r\n    Speech delivered at Milan, 5th February 1920, before the Fascio\r\n                        Milanese Combattimento.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf it were possible, before voting on the orders of the day, to put into\r\npractice the system of democracy, we ought to have summoned the\r\nAssembly. But when events follow one another with lightning speed, it is\r\nnot possible to carry out this system of absolute Democracy.\r\n\r\nWe have, therefore, voted the orders of the day, and wait for you to\r\nratify them. We have brought forward three, and done so from a point of\r\nview essentially Fascista. I dare to say that one is born a Fascista,\r\nand that it is difficult to become one. All the other parties and\r\nassociations argue on a basis of dogmas and from the standpoint of\r\ndefinite preconceptions and infallible ideals. We, being an anti-party,\r\nhave no preconceptions. We are not like the Socialists, who always think\r\nthat the working masses are in the right, and we are not like the\r\nConservatives, who think that they are always in the wrong. We have got\r\nabove all this and have the privilege of moving on the ground of pure\r\nobjectivity. Voting these “orders of the day,” after a serious and\r\nelaborate discussion, we have kept before us three classes of facts or\r\nelements. First, we have kept in mind the general interests of the\r\nnation, particularly as regards the recent strikes. Secondly, we have\r\nconsidered the subject of production, because if we kill production, if\r\nto-day we render sterile the fount of economic activity, to-morrow there\r\nwill be universal poverty. Thirdly, we have been guided, in voting these\r\norders of the day, by our disinterested love for the working classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_All must sacrifice themselves._ I agree with those who recommend the\r\nspirit of sacrifice also to the working classes; I agree, because we do\r\nnot only say to the working men that they must wait, while still\r\nworking, for better times to come in order to break the vicious circle\r\nin which they move; we also say that, generally speaking, capital must\r\nbe controlled. In this connection I announce to you that in a short time\r\na manifesto will be issued in which it will be once more asserted that,\r\nin order to solve the financial problem, it is necessary to resort to a\r\nthreefold measure: first, the partial confiscation of all wealth over a\r\ncertain amount; secondly, the heavy taxation of inheritance, and\r\nthirdly, the confiscation of super war profits.\r\n\r\n\r\n_No Pessimism._ I am not a bit pessimistic about the future of the\r\nItalian nation. If I were, I should retire from public life. But as I am\r\nprofoundly optimistic, I think that with the January strikes over we\r\nhave passed the critical period of our social crisis.\r\n\r\nYou will tell me that February has not brought much light; we have the\r\nstrike of 50,000 textile workers belonging to the Popular Party, which\r\nshows that black Bolshevism has the same destructive and anti-social\r\ncharacter as the other Bolshevism. But it seems to me that the social\r\ncrisis is stabilising itself while awaiting solution. If we can get over\r\nthese next six or eight months without catastrophe, if we can increase\r\nour trade with the East, if the workmen can be made to understand that\r\nwe cannot take our money there but must send our manufactured goods, and\r\nthat only thus will the high rate of living be diminished, because only\r\nfrom the East come those raw materials of which we stand in need, it is\r\ncertain that the workmen will repudiate the more destructive than\r\nconstructive weapon of strikes and settle down to serious work.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sure Repentance._ Our position as regards the syndicalist movement is\r\nnot reactionary, as has been said by some purposely malicious adversary.\r\nI wrote some very bitter articles during the strikes, but these\r\narticles, which were so incriminating, brought me approval which was\r\nvery significant. If there is a man in the Italian Union of Workmen who\r\nhas worked seriously, it is the republican Carlo Bazzi, who has recently\r\nfounded the Syndicate of Co-operation, which is the necessary\r\ncounterwork to the Socialist co-operative movement. Now Bazzi wrote my\r\nbrother[4] a letter which contained these words: “I fully subscribe to\r\nMussolini’s article ‘You are immortal, Cagoia.’” This is enough for me.\r\nBut, at the same time, I do not require that everybody shall agree with\r\nme, and that there shall be no one who differs. I am always ready to\r\npersuade myself of my mistake when I am in the wrong. But I do not think\r\nthat our work can be valued now. I think that within five or six months’\r\ntime there will be quite a few Socialists who will recognise that I am\r\nthe only Socialist that there has been in Italy for the last five years;\r\nand I am not being paradoxical, even if I add that the Socialist Party\r\non the whole is detestable. I think, too, that a great many elements of\r\nthe Centre and followers of Turati are beginning to recognise it even\r\nnow, and that in a short time the working classes will admit that the\r\ndays of 15th April and 20th–21st July, with all our violent opposition,\r\nwere providential and miraculous, because, having put the stake between\r\nthe wheels of the runaway coach, we prevented that what has happened in\r\nHungary should happen in Italy.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  Arnaldo Mussolini, Editor of _Il Popolo d’Italia_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Production necessary._ To-day it is said that poverty should not be\r\nsocialised, but that is what we said two years ago, just as to-day it is\r\nsaid that there must be increased production, as we said two years ago.\r\nAnd when history comes to be written, as it will be shortly, then our\r\nwork will be judged very differently from that of the Socialists and the\r\nresponsible elements in the working classes.\r\n\r\nThe discussion of this evening, I think, might end with a declaration\r\nupon these four points:\r\n\r\n1. The meeting ratifies the “orders of the day” voted by the Executive\r\nCommittee and the Central Committee.\r\n\r\n2. The meeting reaffirms its solidarity with the just demands of the\r\npostal telegraphists and the railway men and all the State employees\r\n(because I have never been tired of repeating that we are against the\r\nstrike, but not against the demands of the staff).\r\n\r\n3. The meeting votes a warning to the Government that the working of the\r\nState services must be made really efficient, whether it be by removing\r\nthe bureaucratic management or by industrialisation. (And I think that\r\nautonomous organisations can be formed of the postal, telephone and\r\nrailway services, in which the agents would have a large direct\r\nrepresentation.)\r\n\r\n4. Finally, the meeting votes its sympathy with all the working-class\r\nelements who are agitating against the Socialist Party and urges them to\r\ngather together in a compact body so that, though hitherto it has not\r\nbeen possible, from to-day onwards it may be possible, even in Italy, to\r\nlive and work and struggle without being slaves to the new tyrannies,\r\nwithout the necessity of being compelled to become a mere member in a\r\nflock of membership cardholders like a flock of sheep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n “WE ARE NOT AGAINST LABOUR, BUT AGAINST THE SOCIALIST PARTY, IN AS FAR\r\n                      AS IT REMAINS ANTI-ITALIAN”\r\n\r\n    Speech delivered at Milan, 24th May 1920, at the second National\r\n                           Fascista meeting.\r\n\r\n  The following is not a conventional speech, but represents a sincere\r\n  act of faith, made in the darkest hour through which Italy passed,\r\n  the hour which followed upon the sweeping electoral and political\r\n  triumphs of 1919, when communal and provincial administrations were\r\n  divorced from the Liberal policies.\r\n\r\n  The subversive newspapers of the day regarded that second Fascista\r\n  meeting as a useless attempt at galvanisation, since the movement\r\n  which was destined later to conquer the State seemed then merely to\r\n  lead to a blind alley. Such is the futility of newspaper prophecies!\r\n\r\n\r\nWords, at certain times, can be facts. Let us act, then, in such a way\r\nthat all the words we utter now may be potential facts to-day, and\r\nreality to-morrow.\r\n\r\nFive years ago, at this time, popular enthusiasm burst forth in all the\r\nstreets and squares of the towns of Italy. Looking back now and studying\r\nthe documents of those times, I can state, with certainty and a clear\r\nconscience, that the cause of intervention was not taken up by the\r\nso-called middle classes, but by the best and healthiest part of the\r\nItalian people. And when I say the people, I mean also the proletariat,\r\nbecause nobody could imagine that the thousands and thousands of\r\ncitizens who followed Corridoni were all from the middle class. I\r\nremember that one Agricultural Chamber of Labour, that of Parma,\r\ndeclared in favour of intervention on the part of Italy with a great\r\nmajority. And even admitting that the war was a mistake, which I do not\r\nadmit, he who scorns the sacrifice which has been made is despicable.\r\n\r\nIf you want to go back and make a critical examination, I am ready to\r\nargue with anybody and to maintain: First, that the war was desired by\r\nthe Central Powers, as has been confessed by the politicians of the\r\nGerman Republic and confirmed by the imperial archives. Secondly, that\r\nItaly could not have remained neutral, and thirdly, that if she had, she\r\nwould find herself, to-day, in a worse condition than she actually does.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we who intervened must not be surprised if the sea is\r\ntempestuous. It would be absurd to expect that a nation which had just\r\npassed through so grave a crisis would recover itself in twenty-four\r\nhours. And when you think that after two years we have not yet got our\r\npeace, when you think of the weakness of those who govern us, you will\r\nrealise that certain crises of doubt are inevitable. But the war gave\r\nthat which we required of it—it gave us victory.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Let us idealise Labour._ When, not long ago, you hissed the song of the\r\nsickle and the hammer, you certainly did not mean to disdain these two\r\ninstruments of human labour. There is nothing more beautiful and noble\r\nthan the sickle, which gives us our bread, and nothing finer than the\r\nhammer, which shapes metals. We must not despise manual work. We must\r\nunderstand that if it is overrated to-day, it is because mankind, as a\r\nwhole, is suffering from a lack of material goods. It is natural,\r\ntherefore, that those who produce these necessaries are excessively\r\noverrated. We do not represent a reactionary element. We tell the masses\r\nnot to go too far, and not to expect to transform society by means of\r\nsomething which they do not understand. If there is to be\r\ntransformation, it must come when the historical and psychological\r\nelements of our civilisation have been taken into account.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Let us unmask the Deceivers._ We do not intend to oppose the movement\r\nof the working classes, only to unmask the work of mystification which\r\nis carried on by a horde of middle-class, lower-middle-class and\r\npseudo-middle-class men, who think that they have become the saviours of\r\nhumanity by the mere fact of being possessed of a card of membership.\r\n“We are not against the proletariat, but against the Socialist Party in\r\nas far as it continues to be anti-Italian.” The Socialist Party\r\ncontinued, after the victory, to abuse the war, to fight against those\r\nwho had been in favour of intervention, threatening reprisals and\r\nexcommunication. Well, I, for my part, shall not give way. I laugh at\r\nexcommunication, and as for reprisals, we shall answer with sacred\r\nreprisals. But we cannot go against the people, because the people made\r\nthe war. We cannot look askance at the peasants, who to-day are\r\nagitating for the solution of the land question. They commit excesses,\r\nbut I ask you to remember that the backbone of the infantry was the\r\npeasantry.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Repentance._ We do not deceive ourselves by thinking that we shall\r\nsucceed in sinking completely the now wrecked ship of Bolshevism. But I\r\nalready note signs of repentance. I think that some day the working\r\nclasses, tired of letting themselves be duped, will turn to us,\r\nrecognising that we have never flattered them, but have always told them\r\nthe brutal truth, working really in their interests. If, to-day, Italy\r\nhas not fallen into the Hungarian abyss, it is due to us, because we\r\nhave saved them by active interposition and by our life.\r\n\r\nWe have then one clear duty, which is to understand the social\r\nphenomenon which is developing before our eyes, and to fight the\r\ndeceivers of the people and maintain a sure and immovable faith in the\r\nfuture of the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Towards Equilibrium._ There has been a period of lassitude on the\r\nmorrow of all great historical crises. But afterwards, little by little,\r\nthe tired muscles recover. All that which before was neglected and\r\ndespised becomes once more honoured and admired. To-day nobody wants to\r\ntalk of war, and it is natural. But when a certain period of time has\r\nelapsed, things will change, and a large part of the Italian people will\r\nrecognise the moral and material value of victory, they will honour\r\nthose who fought and will rebel against those Governments which do not\r\nguarantee the future of the nation. All the people will honour the great\r\n“arditi.” It was the “arditi” who went to the trenches singing, and if\r\nwe returned from the Piave and the Isonzo, if we still hold Fiume, and\r\nare still in Dalmatia, it is due to them.\r\n\r\nThree martyrs, among the thousands who were consecrated to the war,\r\nclearly defined what were to be the destinies of the nation. Battisti\r\ntells us that the boundary of Italy should be at the Brenner; Sauro that\r\nthe Adriatic must be an Italian sea and commercially Italo-Slav; while\r\nRismondo tells us that Dalmatia is Italian. Very well! Let us swear upon\r\nthe standard which bears the sign of death, of that death which gives\r\nlife, and the life which does not fear death, to keep faith to the\r\nsacrifice of these martyrs! (Loud applause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              FASCISMO’S INTERESTS FOR THE WORKING CLASSES\r\n\r\n  Speech delivered at Prato della Marfisia in Ferrara, 4th April 1921.\r\n\r\n  The manifestations of enthusiasm culminating in the meeting at the\r\n  Prato della Marfisia solemnly confirmed the triumphant development\r\n  of Fascismo at Ferrara, the red province _par excellence_. On that\r\n  occasion some fifty thousand _contadini_, who had come on foot from\r\n  the remotest centres of the vast province, spent the day acclaiming\r\n  the “leader of the black shirts” and the new faith in Italy. A\r\n  noteworthy feature was that many red flags belonging to the\r\n  disbanded and defeated Socialist leagues were deposited before\r\n  Mussolini and thereupon trampled underfoot by the crowd.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople of Ferrara! and I say _people_ intentionally, because that which\r\nI see before me now is a marvellous gathering of the people, in both the\r\nRoman and Italian sense of the word. I see among you children who are\r\nupon the threshold of life, and not long ago I shook hands with an old\r\nGaribaldian, a survivor of that heroic Italy which was born at Nola in\r\n1821, when two cavalry officers hoisted the flag of liberty against the\r\nBourbons, and which triumphed at Vittorio Veneto with the great and\r\nmagnificent victory of the Italian people. I see also among you factory\r\nhands and their brothers of the fields.\r\n\r\nWe, Fascisti, have a great love for the working classes. But our love,\r\nin as far as it is pure, is seriously disinterested and intransigent.\r\nOur love does not consist in burning incense and creating new idols and\r\nnew kings, but in telling upon every occasion and in every place the\r\nplain truth, and the more this truth is unpalatable the greater the need\r\nto speak it out.\r\n\r\nWe, Fascisti, hitherto slandered and maligned, wished to continue the\r\nwar in order to obtain freedom of movement in Italy, and although not\r\ngiving way to a sense of weak demagogism, we are the first to recognise\r\nthat the rights of the labouring classes are sacred, and even more so\r\nthe rights of those who work the soil. And here I can give hearty praise\r\nto the Fascisti of Ferrara, who have undertaken with facts, and not with\r\nthe useless words of the politicians, that agrarian revolution which\r\nmust gradually give the peasants the possession of the soil. I strongly\r\nencourage the Fascisti of Ferrara to go on as they have begun, and to\r\nbecome the vanguard of the Fascista agrarian movement in all Italy.\r\n\r\nHow does it come about that we are said to be sold to the middle\r\nclasses, capitalism and the Government? But already our enemies dare no\r\nlonger continue this accusation, so false and ridiculous is it. This\r\nimpressive meeting would move a heart harder than mine, and shows me\r\nthat you have done justice to those base calumnies put into circulation\r\nby people who believed in the eternity of their fortunes, while in\r\nreality they had barricaded themselves in a castle which must fall with\r\nthe first breath of a Fascista revolt. And this Fascista revolt, and we\r\ncould also use the more sacred and serious word _revolution_, is\r\ninspired by indestructible and moral motives and has nothing to do with\r\nincentives of a material nature. We, Fascisti, say that above all the\r\ncompetition and those differences which divide men—and which might\r\nalmost be called natural and inevitable, since life would be\r\nextraordinarily dull if everybody thought in the same way—above all this\r\nthere is a single reality, common in all, and it is the reality of the\r\nnation and of the country to which we are bound, as the tree is bound by\r\nits roots to the soil which nourishes it.\r\n\r\nThus, whether you like it or not, the country is an indestructible,\r\neternal and immortal unity, which, like all ideas, institutions and\r\nsentiments in this world, may be eclipsed for a time, but which revives\r\nagain in the depths of the soul, as the seed thrown in the soil bursts\r\ninto flower with the coming of the warmth of spring. We have thus, by\r\nour furious blows, broken the unworthy crust beneath which lay\r\nimprisoned the soul of the proletariat. There were those among the\r\nproletariat who were ashamed to be Italian; there were those who,\r\nbrutalised by propaganda, shouted “Welcome to the Germans!” and also\r\n“Long live Austria!” They were for the most part irresponsible but\r\nsometimes wicked! Well we, Fascisti, want to bring into every city, into\r\nevery part of the country, even the most remote, the pride and passion\r\nof belonging to the most noble Italian race; the race which has produced\r\nDante, which has given Galileo, the greatest masterpieces of art, Verdi,\r\nMazzini, Garibaldi and d’Annunzio to the world, and which has produced\r\nthe people who won Vittorio Veneto.\r\n\r\nAnd not this only. We do not intend to push the working classes\r\nbackwards. All that which they have won and which they will win is\r\nsacred. But they must acquire these conquests by material and moral\r\nimprovement. We, Fascisti, do not speak only of rights, we speak also of\r\nduty, as Mazzini would have wished. We have not only the verb “to take,”\r\nwe have also the verb “to give,” because sometimes when our country\r\ncalls, whether she be threatened by an internal or external enemy, we\r\nexact both from our adherents and from those who sympathise with us\r\nreadiness even for the supreme sacrifice. And you, Fascisti of Ferrara,\r\nhave consecrated the Fascista ideals with martyrdom.\r\n\r\nIf the idea of Fascismo had not contained in itself great potentiality,\r\nnobility and beauty, do you think that it would have spread with this\r\ntremendous impetus! Do you think that seven lives would have been given\r\nfor it, lives which point out to us the path of perseverance and\r\nvictory? A short time ago I went to your cemetery. One by one we visited\r\nthe graves and threw our flowers upon them. Those seconds of silence\r\nwhich we passed there were pregnant with feeling. Each one of us felt\r\nthat within those graves were the bodies of young men in the flower of\r\ntheir days, men who were certainly loved and who had before them all the\r\npossibilities of life. They are dead; they have fallen. But we, in this\r\ngreat hour of your history, O people of Ferrara, will recall them one by\r\none in the orders of the day; and since they are not dead, because their\r\nmortal clay is transformed in the infinite play of the possibilities of\r\nthe universe, we ask of the pure, bright blood of the youth of Ferrara\r\nthe inspiration to be true to our ideals, to be faithful to our nation.\r\nAnd so we are content that our flags, after having saluted the dead,\r\nsmile on life, because the working people of Ferrara, and of all Italy,\r\nhave found the true path that had been forgotten, have cast off all\r\nthose ignoble politicians who had filled their heads with lying fables.\r\n\r\nWe, O Italians of Ferrara, have no need to go beyond our boundaries,\r\nbeyond the seas, in order to find the word of wisdom and of life. We do\r\nnot need to go to Russia in order to see how a great people may be\r\nmassacred. We do not need to turn the pages of the Muscovite gospels;\r\ngospels which the prophets themselves are reviling since, overwhelmed by\r\nthe reality of life, they are denying them. We have no need to imitate\r\nothers, because brilliant original minds are to be found in Italy in all\r\nbranches of civilisation and learning. And if there is to be Socialism,\r\nit cannot be the bestial, tyrannical Socialism of yesterday, it can only\r\nbe the Socialism of Carlo Pisacane, of Giuseppe Ferrari and Giuseppe\r\nMazzini.\r\n\r\nHere, O people of Ferrara, is your history, your life and your future.\r\nAnd we, who have undertaken this hard battle, which has cost us tens and\r\nhundreds of lives, we do not ask you for salaries, we do not ask you for\r\nvotes. We only ask you for one thing, and that is that you shall shout\r\nwith us “Long live Italy!” (Loud applause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n “MY FATHER WAS A BLACKSMITH AND I HAVE WORKED WITH HIM; HE BENT IRON,\r\n              BUT I HAVE THE HARDER TASK OF BENDING SOULS”\r\n\r\n  Speech delivered at Milan, 6th December 1922, before the workmen of\r\n    the iron foundries, in answer to Engineer Vanzetti, the manager.\r\n\r\n  On the occasion of his first visit to Milan after assuming the\r\n  Premiership of the Council, the city where he had lived and the\r\n  centre of his victorious political strife, Mussolini was urgently\r\n  summoned to the works of the Lombard Iron Foundries (Acciaierie\r\n  Lombarde), where he was welcomed with enthusiastic demonstrations of\r\n  support and appreciation. During the stormy years of 1919–20 these\r\n  very works were the scene of extraordinary events.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am particularly glad to have seen these works, already known to me by\r\nwhat has been accomplished in them in the last five strenuous years. I\r\nam not going to make a speech, but, as has always been—and always will\r\nbe—my way, I shall tell you things clearly as they are, things that will\r\ninterest you.\r\n\r\nThe Government over which I have the honour of presiding is not, cannot\r\nand does not wish to be anti-proletariat. The workmen are a vital part\r\nof the nation; they are Italians and, like all Italians, when they work,\r\nwhen they produce and when they live orderly lives, must be protected,\r\nrespected and defended. My Government is very strong and does not need\r\nto seek a great deal of outside support; it neither asks for it nor\r\nrefuses it. If the workmen’s organisations choose to give me support, I\r\nshall not reject it. But we shall have to come to a clear understanding\r\nand to make definite agreements in order to avoid dissension later.\r\n\r\nI was deeply moved just now while I was visiting the factory, and seemed\r\nfor an instant to be living again the bygone days of my youth. Because I\r\ndo not come of an aristocratic and illustrious family. My ancestors were\r\npeasants who tilled the earth, and my father was a blacksmith who bent\r\nred-hot iron on the anvil. Sometimes, when I was a boy, I helped my\r\nfather in his hard and humble work, and now I have the infinitely harder\r\ntask of bending souls. At twenty I worked with my hands—I repeat, with\r\nmy hands—first as a mason’s lad and afterwards as a mason. And I do not\r\ntell you this in order to arouse your sympathy, but to show you how\r\nimpossible it is for me to be against the working class. I am, however,\r\nthe enemy of those who, in the name of false and ridiculous ideologies,\r\ntry to dupe the workmen and drive them towards ruin.\r\n\r\nYou will have the opportunity of realising that more valuable than my\r\nwords will be the acts of my Government, which, in all that it does,\r\nwill be inspired by and keep before it these three fundamental\r\nprinciples:\r\n\r\nFirst: The NATION, which is an undeniable reality.\r\n\r\nSecondly: The necessity of PRODUCTION, because greater and better\r\nproduction is not only the interest of the capitalist but also of the\r\nworkman; since the workman, together with the capitalist, loses his\r\nlivelihood and falls into poverty if the productions of the nation do\r\nnot find a market in the trade-centres of the world.\r\n\r\nThirdly: THE PROTECTION OF THE LEGITIMATE RIGHTS OF THE WORKING CLASSES.\r\n\r\nKeeping these three essential principles in sight, I intend to give\r\npeace to Italy and to make her more respected at home and abroad.\r\n\r\nNobody wants to go in search of adventures which will imperil the lives\r\nand wealth of the citizens; but, on the other hand, neither do we wish\r\nto follow a policy of renunciation nor allow Italy to be the last\r\nconsidered among the nations. In order that we may be listened to in\r\ninternational conferences—conferences which are of the greatest\r\nimportance to you workmen—it is necessary that the most rigid discipline\r\nbe maintained at home, as no one will listen to us if we have a\r\ndisturbed and unsettled country behind us.\r\n\r\nYou, workmen, must not think that it is only the head of the Government\r\nwho is speaking to you now, but a man who knows you well and who is\r\nknown by you; a man who understands your value and what you can and what\r\nyou cannot do. But, as the head of the Government, I tell you that this\r\none over which I preside is serious, strong and sure of itself, and no\r\nslow-moving bureaucracy; it is a Government that wishes to act in the\r\ninterests of the working classes, interests which will always be\r\nrecognised when they are just.\r\n\r\nThe workmen thought that they could, and ought to, disassociate\r\nthemselves from the life of the nation; and this has been a great\r\nmistake. They ought, instead, to be a most intimate part of the nation,\r\nso that all our long and laborious toiling may not be miserably lost.\r\n\r\nThis is the message which comes from our dead, who, hovering above us,\r\nrepeat this command.\r\n\r\nThe Italian people must somehow find that medium of harmony necessary\r\nfor the reconstruction and development of civilisation; and if there be\r\nrebellious and seditious minorities they must be inexorably stamped out.\r\n\r\nTreasure up these words in your hearts and remember the motto of the\r\nFascista Syndicates:\r\n\r\n             The country must not be denied but conquered.\r\n\r\nI raise my glass with you and drink to the future and the fortunes of\r\nItalian industry, that it may take a glorious place in the eyes of the\r\nwhole world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              LABOUR TO TAKE THE FIRST PLACE IN NEW ITALY\r\n\r\n  Speech delivered at Rome, 6th January 1923, before a representative\r\n  gathering of Fascisti dock-workers from Genoa who had presented him\r\n                      with an illuminated address.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou must certainly be aware of the fact that I take a great interest in\r\nyour city—an interest which dates from 1915 when Genoa, together with\r\nMilan and Rome, led the way to revolution; because the revolution which\r\nhas brought the Fascisti into power began in the May of 1915, was\r\ncontinued in the October of 1922, and goes on still, and will go on for\r\nsome time. I am very pleased to accept your message, and I thank you\r\nwith sincere cordiality.\r\n\r\nI must tell you that the Government over which I have the honour of\r\npresiding never has had, never can and never will have the intention of\r\nfollowing a so-called antilabour policy. On the contrary, I want to\r\npraise the working classes, who do not put obstacles in the way of the\r\nGovernment, who work, and who have practically abolished strikes. They\r\nhave redeemed themselves, because they no longer believe in the Asiatic\r\nUtopia which came from Russia; they believe in themselves, in their\r\nwork; they believe in the possibility, which for me is a certainty, of a\r\nprosperous Italian nation.\r\n\r\nYou have been directly interested in this greatness of the nation, and\r\nyou, who come from such a live centre as Genoa, are the most suited to\r\nfeel this ferment of new life, all this active preparation for a new\r\ndestiny.\r\n\r\nThe Government, as you see, governs for all, over the heads of all, and,\r\nif necessary, against all. It governs for all, because it takes into\r\naccount all general interests; it governs against all, when any group,\r\nwhether of the middle class or of the proletariat, tries to put its\r\ninterests before the general interests of the nation. I am sure that if\r\nthe working classes—of which you are the aristocratic minority—continue\r\nto give this noble exhibition of tranquillity and discipline, the\r\nnation, which was upon the verge of ruin, will recover itself\r\ncompletely.\r\n\r\nI do not say things which have not been well considered and thought\r\nover; and, after two months of government, I tell you that if the\r\nFascista revolution had been postponed for another few months or perhaps\r\nonly another few weeks, the nation would have fallen into a state of\r\nchaos. All that we are performing now is really work in arrears; we are\r\nfreeing the citizens from the weight of laws which were the result of a\r\nfoolish demagogic policy; we are freeing the State from all those\r\nsuperstructures which were suffocating it, from all the economic\r\nfunctions which it was unfitted to perform; we are working to balance\r\nthe budget, which means re-establishing the value of the lira, which\r\nmeans taking a position of dignity and influence in the international\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe Italy which we wish to make, which we are building up day by day,\r\nwhich we shall succeed in making, as it is our aim and our immovable\r\ndetermination to do, will be a magnificent creation of power and of\r\nwisdom. You can rest assured that in this Italy the workman—and all\r\nlabour both of the brain and of the hands—will take, as is right, the\r\nfirst place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PART IV\r\n\r\n                        MUSSOLINI THE “FASCISTA”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          THE THREE DECLARATIONS AT THE FIRST FASCISTA MEETING\r\n\r\n   Speech delivered at Milan, 23rd March 1919, at the first Fascista\r\n                                meeting.\r\n\r\n  In the spring of 1919, the most critical period through which Italy\r\n  has passed, the attempt initiated by Benito Mussolini to summon the\r\n  men prepared to fight Bolshevism, that apparently triumphant beast,\r\n  seemed absolute madness. A handful of bold spirits, for the most\r\n  part ex-soldiers coming from the extreme interventionist sections,\r\n  responded to the appeal. But the gravity of the moment and the\r\n  danger of physical sacrifice to which they exposed themselves were\r\n  not sufficient to lessen their ardour and determination for an\r\n  immediate counter-offensive. This had its conclusive expression in\r\n  the assault upon and the burning of the offices of the newspaper\r\n  _Avanti_, which took place on a day of general strike, when two\r\n  hundred thousand workmen marched defiantly through the streets of\r\n  Milan.\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst of all, a few words about the proceedings. Without too much\r\nformality or pedantry, I will read you three declarations which seem to\r\nme worthy of being discussed and voted upon. Then in the afternoon we\r\nwill resume the discussion of the declaration of our programme. I tell\r\nyou at once that we cannot go into detail. Wishing to act, we must take\r\nsalient facts as they exist.\r\n\r\nThe first declaration is as follows:\r\n\r\n  The Meeting of the 23rd March first salutes with reverence and\r\n  remembrance the sons of Italy who have fallen for the cause of the\r\n  greatness of the country and the liberty of the world, the maimed\r\n  and disabled, and all the fighters and ex-prisoners who fulfilled\r\n  their duty, and declares itself ready to uphold strongly the\r\n  vindication of rights, both material and moral, advocated by the\r\n  “Association of Fighters.”\r\n\r\nAs we do not wish to form a Party of ex-soldiers, because something in\r\nthat line has already been done in various cities in Italy, we cannot\r\nsay exactly what this programme of vindications will be; those\r\ninterested will do so. We declare simply that we will uphold them. We do\r\nnot wish to classify the dead, to look into their pockets to find out to\r\nwhich party they belonged; we leave this sort of occupation to the\r\nOfficial Socialists. We include in one single loving thought all the\r\nfallen, from the general to the humblest soldier, from the most\r\nintelligent to the most ignorant and uncultured. But you must allow me\r\nto remember with special, if not exclusive, affection our dead, those\r\nwho were with us in the glorious May: the Corridoni, Reguzzoni, Vidali,\r\nDeffenu, and our Serrani—all that marvellous youth which went to fight\r\nand remained to die. Certainly when one speaks of the greatness of the\r\ncountry and the liberty of the world, there may be someone who will\r\nsneer and smile ironically, because it is the fashion now to run down\r\nthe war, but war must be either wholly accepted or wholly rejected. If\r\nthis line is to be taken up, it will be for us to do so and not the\r\nothers. Besides, wishing to examine the situation in the light of facts,\r\nwe say that the active and passive sides of so immense an undertaking\r\ncannot be established with cut-and-dried figures. One cannot put on one\r\nside the “quantum” of that which has been accomplished and that which\r\nhas not; the “qualifying” element must be taken into account.\r\n\r\nFrom this point of view we can, with complete certainty, maintain that\r\nthe country is greater to-day, not only because it extends as far as\r\nthe Brenner—reached by Ergisto Bezzi, to whom my thoughts\r\nturn—(Applause.)—not only because it extends as far as Dalmatia; Italy\r\nis greater, even if small minds try their little experiments, because\r\nwe feel ourselves greater inasmuch as we have the experience of the\r\nwar, inasmuch as we willed it, it was not forced upon us and we could\r\nhave avoided it. The choosing of this path was a sign that there are\r\nelements of greatness in our history and our blood, because if it were\r\nnot so, we, to-day, should be the least important people in the world.\r\nThe war has given us that for which we asked. It has yielded its\r\nnegative and positive advantages: negative, in as far as it has\r\nprevented the Houses of Hapsburg and Hohenzollern from dominating the\r\nworld—and this result, which all can see, is enough in itself to\r\njustify the war; and positive, because in no nation has reaction\r\ntriumphed. Everything moves towards a stronger political and economic\r\nDemocracy. In spite of certain details which may injure the more or\r\nless intelligent elements, the war has given all that we asked.\r\n\r\nAnd why do we speak of ex-prisoners also? It is a burning question.\r\nEvidently there were those who surrendered themselves, but those are\r\ncalled deserters. The large majority of the mass which fell prisoner did\r\nso after having fought and done their duty. If this were not so, we\r\ncould begin to brand Cesare Battisti and many brave and brilliant\r\nofficers and men who had the misfortune to fall into the hands of the\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The National Vindications._ Second declaration:\r\n\r\n  The Meeting of the 23rd March declares that it will oppose\r\n  Imperialism in other peoples which would be prejudicial to Italy,\r\n  and any eventual Imperialism in Italy which would be prejudicial to\r\n  other nations, and accepts the fundamental principle of the League\r\n  of Nations, which presupposes the geographical integrity of every\r\n  nation. This, as far as Italy is concerned, must be realised on the\r\n  Alps and the Adriatic with the annexation of Fiume and Dalmatia.\r\n\r\nWe have forty million inhabitants and an area of 287,000 square\r\nkilometres, divided by the Apennines, which reduce still further the\r\navailability of the land capable of cultivation. In ten or twenty years’\r\ntime we shall be sixty millions, and we have a bare million and a half\r\nsquare kilometres of land in the way of colonies, which to a large\r\nextent is barren, and to which we certainly can never send the surplus\r\nof our people. But, if we look round, we see England, with forty-seven\r\nmillion inhabitants, and a colonial empire of fifty-five million square\r\nkilometres, and we see France, with a population of thirty-eight\r\nmillions, and a colonial empire of fifteen million square kilometres.\r\nAnd I could prove to you with figures that all the nations of the world,\r\nnot excluding Portugal, Holland and Belgium, have colonies which they\r\ncling to, and are not in the least disposed to relinquish for all the\r\nideologies which come from the other side of the ocean. Imperialism is\r\nat the base of the life of every people which desires economic and\r\nspiritual expansion. That which distinguishes the different kinds of\r\nimperialism is the method adopted in its pursuit. Now the method which\r\nwe choose, and shall choose, will never resemble the barbaric\r\npenetration of the Germans. And we say, either everybody idealist or\r\nnobody. One cannot understand how people who are well off can preach\r\nidealism to those who suffer, because that would be very easy. We want\r\nour place in the world because we have a right to it. I reaffirm the\r\nprinciple of the Society of Nations, but we must beware lest this\r\nprinciple mean only protection of the material interests of wealthy\r\nnations.\r\n\r\n\r\n_In View of the Elections._ Third declaration:\r\n\r\n  The Meeting of the 23rd March pledges the Fascisti to prevent by\r\n  every means in their power the candidature of neutralists of any\r\n  party.\r\n\r\nYou see I pass from one subject to another, but there is logic in it, an\r\nunderlying thread. I am not an enthusiast for ballot-paper battles, so\r\nmuch so that for some time I have abolished the chronicles of the\r\nChamber, and nobody is sorry. My example, too, has caused other papers\r\nto do the same, within the limits of strict necessity. It is clear in\r\nany case that the elections will take place before the end of the year.\r\nThe date and the system to be followed are not yet known, but this year\r\nthese electoral campaigns and ballot-paper battles will take place.\r\n\r\nNow, whether one likes it or not, the war having been of late the\r\ndominant event of our national life, it is clear that in these elections\r\nthe subject of the war cannot be avoided. We shall accept the battle\r\nprecisely on the topic war, because not only have we not repented of\r\nthat which we have done, but we go further and say, with that courage\r\nwhich is the result of our individuality, that if the same condition of\r\nthings which existed in 1915 were repeated in Italy, we should demand\r\nwar again as in 1915.\r\n\r\nNow it is very sad to think that there are those who formerly were in\r\nfavour of intervention and who now have changed. Only a few have done\r\nso, and it has not always been for political reasons. Some have changed\r\nfor those reasons, and this I do not wish to discuss, but there has also\r\nbeen defection due to physical fear. “In order to pacify these people\r\nlet us cede Dalmatia, let us renounce something!” But their calculations\r\nhave piteously failed. We shall not only refuse to take up this\r\npolitical line, but we shall not give way to that physical fear which is\r\nsimply absurd. One life is of the same value as another, and one\r\nbarricade is as good as another. If there is to be a fight, we shall\r\nengage also in that of the elections.\r\n\r\nThere have been neutralists also among the official Socialists and the\r\nRepublicans. We shall go and examine the passports of all these people,\r\nboth the ultra-neutralists and those who accepted the war as a painful\r\nburden; we shall go to their meetings, we shall present candidates and\r\nfind every possible means of routing them. (Prolonged applause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             OUTLINE OF THE AIMS AND PROGRAMME OF FASCISMO\r\n\r\n   Speech delivered at Milan, 22nd July 1919, at the Liceo Beccaria.\r\n\r\n  The evening before the general international strike of the 20th\r\n  and 21st of July 1919, called by the federal organisations as a\r\n  reaction to the rash movement, the National Socialists, the\r\n  Republicans, the Democrats and the Fascisti met in order to share\r\n  the responsibilities for possible complications and to demonstrate\r\n  the inconsistency of so-called revolutionary attitudes.\r\n\r\n  This manifestation, according to the intention of its organisers,\r\n  had also the object of marking the beginning of a political\r\n  concentration of the Left, composed of ex-interventionists. But the\r\n  attempt afterwards failed, chiefly on account of want of\r\n  understanding on the part of the Republican Party, and because of\r\n  the development of the spiritual crisis within the mass of Italian\r\n  Fascismo.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think that it will depend upon the sincerity and loyalty with which we\r\njoin in this meeting whether it will become an historical event, or a\r\nlittle fact of everyday life destined to pass without leaving any trace.\r\n\r\nThis being the case, it will not surprise you if I speak with a\r\nfrankness almost brutal. I add at once that the friendly confusion of\r\nthis moment of reunion after schisms and separations will not eliminate\r\nthe necessity of settling certain personal and political questions,\r\notherwise this union, which we wish to be eminently fruitful, cannot be\r\nother than painfully sterile.\r\n\r\nWhat are we looking for, we who are members of U.S.M., the Fascio of\r\nFighters, the Association of Fighters, the Association of Arditi, the\r\nUnion of Demobilised, the Association of Volunteers, the Association of\r\nGaribaldians, the Republican Party, the Italian Socialist Union, the\r\nCorridoni Club, etc.—we who are together represented in the Committee of\r\nIntesa e Azione[5] which was formed at the time of the movement against\r\nthe high cost of living? We are looking for the least common denominator\r\nfor this understanding and action. Shall we find it? Yes! We come from\r\ndifferent schools; we have different temperaments, and temperaments\r\ndivide men more widely than ideas; we belong to an individualist people;\r\nbut all this does not prevent something else bringing us together and\r\nbinding us both in these present contingencies and in that which has to\r\ndo with the action of to-morrow.\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  Understanding and Action.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Basis of Unity._ There can be a thousand shades of ideas among us,\r\nbut upon one important point we are all agreed, and that is in regarding\r\nthe Socialist manifestation as a bluff, a comedy, a speculation and\r\nblackmail. Also we are all agreed in making a differentiation between\r\nthe Socialist Party and the mass of the workmen. The Socialist Party has\r\nusurped up to yesterday the name of being a pure revolutionary\r\norganisation, of being the protector and the exclusive, genuine\r\nrepresentative of the working masses. This is all nonsense and must be\r\ncleared up. Referring to statistics, we find that out of forty-two\r\nmillions of Italians, hardly sixty thousand were enrolled in the\r\nSocialist Party in the August of 1919, and the dominating element is a\r\ngroup composed of lower-middle-class people in the most philistine sense\r\nof the word.\r\n\r\nIn the unlikely and absurd event of a triumph on the part of the\r\nLeninist revolutionaries, ten of these idiots would be, to-morrow, the\r\nten Ministers of the Italian nation. The Socialist Party is one thing,\r\nand the organised mass of working men another, and the disorganised mass\r\nyet another and seven times larger than the rest put together.\r\n\r\nWe must not allow ourselves to approach the working classes in the\r\nsometimes unctuous, sometimes theatrical, manner of the demagogues. The\r\nmasses must be educated and for this reason must have the straight\r\ntruth. Many of the crowds which the Socialists sway are not worthy of\r\nblandishments, because they consist of masses of brutes infected and\r\nbarbarised by the “Red” gospel. Our working-class colleagues know all\r\nabout it, because they have had to leave certain factories. We must not\r\npresent ourselves to the masses as charlatans, promising Paradise within\r\na short time, but as educators who do not seek either success,\r\npopularity, salaries or votes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Produce! Produce! Produce! The Admonition of Merrheim._ The way in\r\nwhich the working masses should and must be spoken to has been shown us\r\nby Merrheim, one of the thinking heads of French Syndicalism. Last\r\nJanuary he made a very important speech, and it would be a good thing to\r\nrun over those parts of it which are now of most importance, especially\r\nthose touching upon the relations between economics and politics and the\r\nnecessity of production.\r\n\r\n“The militant Socialists must tell the truth, and all the truth, to the\r\nmasses, even if the truth brings hatred and slander. Now the truth is\r\nfor all those who reflect, that the bad conditions of life, which are\r\nthe trouble of the masses, are not going to be remedied by a solution\r\nbased on an increase of wages which is not only inoperative, but\r\nentirely in opposition to economic laws. The masses must be told that\r\nthe régime of production and distribution of commodities must undergo a\r\ntransformation, if efficacious and lasting remedies are to be found for\r\nexisting bad conditions, and that this can be arrived at by means of the\r\nforce of organisation.”\r\n\r\n“... It is pleasant to provoke loud applause by telling the audience at\r\nmeetings that we are overstocked with commodities, and that they can\r\nconsume without limit and enjoy comfort by imposing wages proportionate\r\nto their desires without increasing production.”\r\n\r\n“Courage lies in repeating to the masses that each man is at the same\r\ntime a producer and consumer, and that the continued increase of\r\nproduction is necessary and indispensable.”\r\n\r\n“Courage lies in saying that it is not only impossible to satisfy those\r\nnormal needs, natural to everyone, without normal production, but that\r\nit is absolutely impossible to obtain general comfort for everyone if at\r\nthe same time individual production in the general interest is not\r\nincreased.”\r\n\r\n“Courage lies in proclaiming that the purely political revolution, which\r\ninflames the people’s minds, would not solve the social problem, the\r\nsolution of which has been precipitated and rendered essential by the\r\nwar.”\r\n\r\n“Courage lies in repeating untiringly to the masses that the revolution\r\nwhich must be brought about must be economic, and that it is not to be\r\nbrought about in the streets by a delirious crowd destroying for the\r\nsake of destruction.”\r\n\r\n“Courage lies in saying that an economic revolution draws its substance\r\nfrom labour, and that it is strengthened, advanced, and carried out by\r\nthe intensification of production whether in the fields or in the\r\nfactories, and by a further utilisation of scientific processes and\r\nmethods of production.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Italian Situation._ We agree upon a third point, in connection with\r\nexisting circumstances, that is in maintaining that our national\r\nsituation is critical, though far from being desperate. Briefly, it is\r\nthis. From the 1st July we have been defaulting debtors of England.\r\nSince the 31st July other financial agreements with the United States\r\nmust be faced. To save the situation a loan of one milliard dollars\r\n(seven to eight milliard lire) must be arranged. The railways have a\r\ncoal supply for only fifteen more days. There are enough provisions for\r\nanother twenty days, that is to say until the end of the month. Two\r\nmillion tons of food must be imported to save us from immediate hunger.\r\nBut these financial and economic agreements depend upon the political\r\nones at Paris.\r\n\r\nThe possibility, almost a certainty, has presented itself to us of\r\nobtaining large concessions in Asia Minor, with the coal mines of\r\nHeraclea. Clémenceau has made difficulties about it, but Lansing told\r\nhim that he could not see any obstacle, given that Italy approved of the\r\nexploitation of the Saar mines on the part of France. We may also obtain\r\noil wells in Armenia.\r\n\r\nBut these acquisitions in the East are in their turn subordinate to the\r\nAdriatic agreements. The solution of the problem of Fiume is already\r\ncompromised by the work of the preceding Delegation, which had already\r\naccepted the principle of a Free State. But the project of Tardieu\r\npresented future dangers as far as the safeguarding of the Italian\r\ncharacter of Fiume is concerned, because the Italian majority in the\r\ncity would be overwhelmed by the mass of Slavs in the country. It is a\r\nquestion, then, of reducing these dangers to the smallest possible\r\nlimits by the introduction of another plan which would substitute for\r\nthe idea of a Free State that of a Free City with limited boundaries.\r\n\r\nIn Dalmatia it is only possible for us to save the centres which have an\r\nItalian majority, with guarantees for the safeguarding of those Italian\r\nminorities scattered in the other centres. The eventual loss of\r\nSebenico, which had strategic and not national value, would be\r\ncompensated for by some other strategic point to be given to Italy.\r\nLansing said that this would be eventually sought for in the\r\nMediterranean.\r\n\r\nGiven this situation, it is no exaggeration to say that the general\r\nSocialist strike is a real attempted crime against the nation. And note:\r\nI could understand a strike which had as its object the setting up of\r\nthe Soviet in Italy, but I do not understand or admit this one, which is\r\nwithout aim, object or justification. It must and will fail, because the\r\nleaders themselves are in the _cul de sac_ of this dilemma: either\r\ntragedy, because the State at this moment has its repressive machinery\r\nin full working order; or comedy, in the event of a revolt on the part\r\nof the workmen already outlined, and due to their being tired of serving\r\na Socialist Party mostly composed of middle-class elements.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is worth while in passing to confute the objection in the\r\n_Stampa_ of Portogruaro, which would like to deny our right of rising up\r\nagainst the strike on the ground that we were in favour of war. “What,”\r\nit says, “is the damage done in two days of strike compared with that\r\ndone in four years of war?” We crush these gentlemen with the reply that\r\nfour years of neutrality would have damaged us more, besides having been\r\nto our lasting and ineffaceable moral shame.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Reactionaries and vice versâ._ For me revolution is not an attack of\r\nSt. Vitus’ dance or an unexpected fit of epilepsy. It must have force,\r\naims, and above all, method. In 1913, when the Socialist Party was\r\nalready rotten, it was I who put into circulation the words which made\r\nthe pulses of the big men of Italian Socialism beat: “This proletariat\r\nis in need of a bath of blood,” I said. It has had it, and it lasted for\r\nthree years. “This proletariat is in need of a day of history.” And it\r\nhas had a thousand.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary then to shake up the masses, because they had fallen\r\ninto a state of weakness and insensibility. To-day this situation exists\r\nno longer. To-day the only way not to live in fear of a revolution is to\r\nthink that we are now in the full swing of one, that it began in the\r\nAugust of 1914 and that it is still going on. It is not a question, as\r\nsome think, of entering into a revolution as one passes from a state of\r\ntranquillity to a state of action. The task of really free spirits is\r\ndifferent. If this great and immense process of changing the world\r\nstagnates or becomes confused, we can hasten it on; but if it is already\r\nprogressing at a frantic rate, then our task is to apply the brakes and\r\nslow it down, in order to avoid disintegration and ruin. To be\r\nrevolutionaries, in certain circumstances, time and place, can be the\r\npride of a lifetime, but when those who speak of revolution are a lot of\r\nparasites, then one must not be afraid, in opposing them, to pass as a\r\nreactionary. One is always a reactionary and revolutionary for somebody.\r\nFritz Adler, revolutionary in the time of Sturck, is a reactionary\r\nto-day compared with the Communists. I am not afraid of the word. I am a\r\nrevolutionary and a reactionary. Really, life is always like this. I am\r\nafraid of the revolution which destroys and does not create. I fear\r\ngoing to extremes, the policy of madness, at the bottom of which may lie\r\nthe destruction of this our fragile mechanical civilisation, robbed of\r\nits solid moral basis, and the coming of a terrible race of dominators\r\nwho would reintroduce discipline into the world and re-establish the\r\nnecessary hierarchies with the cracking of whips and machine-guns.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Compass._ At the same time, as regards reaction and revolution, I\r\nhave a compass in my pocket which guides me. All that which tends\r\ntowards making the Italian people great finds me favourable, and—_vice\r\nversâ_—all that which tends towards lowering, brutalising and\r\nimpoverishing them finds me opposed.\r\n\r\nNow Socialism comes into the second category. I find it odd that my\r\nfriend Carli, the founder of the National Association of Fighters and a\r\nvaliant soldier, puts the Socialists among the advanced parties,\r\nstorming them with a succession of “whys,” as he did in the last number\r\nof the _Roma Futurista_.\r\n\r\nI deny the title of vanguard to Socialism. I deny the use and timeliness\r\nof any co-operation with this party. I maintain that a reactionary party\r\nin 1914, ’15, ’16, ’17, and ’18 cannot become revolutionary in ’19. I\r\nmaintain that this serenading of the Socialists is useless, and this\r\nmaking of advances not clean. One day, in the culminating moment of the\r\nhistory of humanity, they embraced the cause of reaction represented by\r\nthe Germany of the Hohenzollerns and Sudekum. Besides, it is idiotic and\r\ndangerous to lavish blandishments upon the official Socialists; we\r\ncannot reconcile ourselves with these people. There have been those who\r\nhave attached themselves to the movement of to-day, but the Socialists\r\nhave disdained that help, because they are megalomaniacs and nourish,\r\namong other things, the fatuous vanity of splendid isolation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Revision of the Treaty of Versailles._ The Peace of Versailles is\r\nnot a sufficient motive for the courted collaboration. Things must be\r\nmade clear. The Socialists talk of annulling the peace; we wish simply\r\nto revise it. We do not condemn wholesale a peace which a German, and\r\nnot one of the most insignificant, Edward Bernstein, has called nine\r\nparts just. The revision of the peace must not mean condemnation of the\r\nwar. The Florentine Republican Union has published a manifesto which\r\ndefines the limits of protest against the Treaty of Versailles.\r\n\r\n“We do not wish to conceal,” say the Florentine Republicans, “that,\r\nalthough requiring radical amendments, the Treaty is, after all, the\r\nconsecration of the fall of four Imperial autocracies, the fall of\r\nnumerous dynasties, the creation of as many republics, the\r\nre-establishment of Poland, the reconquest of Alsace and Lorraine, and\r\nof Trento and Trieste by Italy, and of Jerusalem by civilised Europe.\r\nAll this would suffice, as long as emendations were made, to bear\r\nwitness to the supreme sanctity of the Italian intervention in the\r\natrocious war let loose by the brutal German Hohenzollerns and\r\nHapsburgs.”\r\n\r\n“We do not approve, however, of the proposed general strike as a form of\r\nprotest, because—and we say so with the traditional sincerity of our\r\nparty—the country is thirsty for fruitful work, and this deluge of\r\nstrikes certainly does not help in that.”\r\n\r\n“The Peace of Versailles must be corrected and brought into keeping with\r\nthe progress of humanity.”\r\n\r\nThis is also our idea. Rather than seek or beg for useless co-operation,\r\nlet us outline a programme of our own of understanding and action. I\r\nrefuse, after having got rid of the old, to accept the new dogmas. I\r\nthink that it is possible to create a strong economic organisation in\r\nItaly based upon these principles:—\r\n\r\n1. Absolute independence from all parties, groups and sets.\r\n\r\n2. Federation and autonomy.\r\n\r\n3. Abolition, as far as possible, of all paid officials.\r\n\r\n4. No steps to be taken without having consulted regularly, by means of\r\na referendum, the masses interested.\r\n\r\nThe means of obtaining this end may be altered according to time and\r\nplace. The organisation will promote at times co-operation, and at times\r\nwar between the classes and the expropriation of class. It will not\r\nalways be for co-operation, but neither will it always be in favour of\r\nclass preservation; and when it expropriates, it will not be to make all\r\npoor, but to make all rich. In the conquest of a colonial market and in\r\ncertain questions connected with the customs, the middle classes and the\r\nproletariat can work together. When there is division of booty, then\r\nclass war; but class war in times of under-production is destructive\r\nnonsense.\r\n\r\n\r\n_In the Political Field._ The Electoral Reform will pass. The scrutiny\r\nof lists and proportional representation will pass. That will determine,\r\nfor obvious reasons, the great coalitions—the Socialist-Leninist, the\r\nClerical-Popular, and, lastly, ours, which might be called the “Alliance\r\nfor the Constituent,” the Republican Alliance or the group of the\r\n“interveners” of the Left.\r\n\r\nOur programme is to present candidates who pledge themselves to place\r\nthe problem of constitutional revision before the new Chamber in the\r\nfirst session.\r\n\r\nThis is the Constituent as I understand it. This is the lowest\r\ndenominator to which all of us can pledge ourselves and around which we\r\ncan all form a union. The moment is particularly propitious for such an\r\norganisation. I think that all we who are represented in this Milanese\r\nCommittee of Intesa e Azione can follow this path.\r\n\r\nIt is a case of “nationalising” this attempt, of making it general all\r\nover Italy. We could, if we wished, number not thousands, but millions\r\nof followers. I myself refuse, in the actual delicate economic situation\r\nin Italy, to adhere to any movement which makes the path clear for\r\nBolshevism and ruin. The victory cannot and must not be destroyed. I\r\nunderstand a certain impatience, but I beg you to reflect that if the\r\nlives of individuals are counted in years, the lives of nations are\r\ncounted in centuries, and we must not refer egoistically to ourselves\r\nthat which is of a general nature. Good strategy is calculation and\r\naudacity. We do not wish to govern by recourse to the bayonet alone,\r\nbecause that would be dictatorship, which we condemn. We wish first to\r\nsound the masses by the coming elections. Once having had our principles\r\naccepted, we will spring to action.\r\n\r\nThe revolution which we desired and obtained in 1915 will be ours again\r\nby the victorious peace in its conclusive phase, and it will be called\r\n“Well-being,” “Liberty” and, above all, “Italy.” (Loud applause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   FASCISMO AND THE RIGHTS OF VICTORY\r\n\r\n      Speech delivered at Florence, 9th October 1919, at the first\r\n                       Congress of the Fascisti.\r\n\r\n  At Florence was held the first Congress of the “Fasci Italiani di\r\n  Combattimento,” which was the name originally given to the Fascista\r\n  movement. This Congress succeeded the improvised, unorganised\r\n  meeting of 19th March at Milan, and was held in an atmosphere of\r\n  isolation and hostility, amid continuous tumult and interruption; so\r\n  much so, that the members of the Congress were repeatedly obliged to\r\n  suspend their proceedings and go out into the streets to defend\r\n  themselves against hostile demonstrations.\r\n\r\n  At that time Florence, the cradle of art, and famed for courtesy and\r\n  hospitality, had been temporarily submerged under waves of\r\n  Bolshevism; Serrati and Lenin, referring to the Italian situation,\r\n  could point to the capital of Tuscany as “the most fertile soil for\r\n  the imminent revolutionary harvest.”\r\n\r\n  But even on that occasion Italian Fascismo was able to hold the\r\n  centre successfully, in spite of the numbers of the adversary.\r\n\r\n\r\nFascisti comrades! I do not know if I shall succeed in giving you a very\r\nconnected speech, as I have not had the opportunity of preparing it, as\r\nis my habit. I had intended to make a Fascista speech to-morrow morning\r\nfor a personal reason which might also interest you, and which gave me\r\nthe right to ask some hours of rest.\r\n\r\nThe other day I left Novi Ligure in a “S.V.A.” with a magnificent pilot,\r\nand, having crossed the Adriatic, came down at Fiume, where D’Annunzio\r\ngave us a great welcome. Returning yesterday, we were caught in a storm\r\non the Istrian tablelands, and were obliged to go out of our course and\r\nto come down at Aiello.\r\n\r\nAt Fiume I lived in what D’Annunzio justly calls “an atmosphere of\r\nmiracles and prodigies.” In the meantime, I bring you his message; he\r\nwas thinking of writing one especially for our meeting. (Applause.) My\r\narrival at Fiume coincided with the capture of the ship _Persia_, about\r\nwhich Captain Giulietti of the “Federation of the Sea” was so agitated.\r\n\r\nThe situation at Fiume is splendid from every point of view. There are\r\nsupplies for three months. The Yugoslavs have no intention of moving.\r\nNot only that; the Croats, to a certain extent, are supplying the town,\r\nwhich shows how inappropriate and insidious the movement was which tried\r\nto stir up the people and make them believe that we were on the verge of\r\na war against the Yugoslavs. Nothing of this exists. D’Annunzio has not,\r\nso far, fired a single shot against those who are on the other side of\r\nthe line of the armistice; on the contrary, he has issued a proclamation\r\nto the Croats, which is a magnificent document both from the political\r\nand the human point of view. It ends with these words: “Long live the\r\nItalian-Croat brotherhood! Long live the brotherhood on the sea!”\r\n\r\nNow, as regards international relations, the position of Fiume is\r\nperfectly clear. D’Annunzio will not move, because everything is in his\r\nfavour. What can the plutocratic powers of Western capitalism do against\r\nhim? Nothing! Absolutely nothing, because to strive against a _fait\r\naccompli_ would be to let loose a still greater calamity which nobody\r\nthinks of either in France or England. In France—and we can say so with\r\ntranquillity—there is a sacred horror of further bloodshed; and as for\r\nthe English, they have made war very well and brilliantly, but now all\r\ntheir ideas are contrary to any warlike undertakings and any adventures\r\nof even a slightly complicated nature. To-morrow Fiume would be a _fait\r\naccompli_ for everybody, because nobody would have the strength to\r\nmodify it. If the Government had been less cowardly, the problem of\r\nFiume would be settled by now, and the Allies would have had to accept\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Forces of the Socialist Party._ And now we come to our affairs. We\r\nmust keep the Socialist Party within sight. Let us look a little closer\r\nat their forces. They have had lately to number their forces, and 14,000\r\nof its 80,000 members have disappeared. They are the disbanded. As many\r\nas 500 sections were not represented in what they call the Assizes of\r\nthe Italian Proletariat. Nothing of very great importance was said or\r\ndone during the congress. Bordiga is not a great general. He is only a\r\nlittle above mediocrity. What he said to the tribune was what I told the\r\ncrowd in 1913. Only Turati’s speech was of any real significance. All\r\nthe other unlimited speeches did not, in the end, give practical\r\nindications of that which the Socialists wish or ought to do.\r\n\r\nOur statements are much more definite than theirs, and we tell you at\r\nonce that we must present an ultimatum to the Government, saying that,\r\nif the censor is not abolished, we Fascisti will not take part in the\r\nelections. It is necessary to protest against an enforced censorship\r\nduring the period of the elections, otherwise we shall seem to show that\r\nwe are ready to accept an arbitrary act. To this we can add another\r\npositive and effective protest. As for the Socialists, the larger part\r\nof them are distinguished by physical cowardice. They do not like\r\nfighting, they do not wish to fight; fire and steel frighten them.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, and I want to draw your attention to this, we must\r\nnot confuse this creation, which is for the most part artificial, with a\r\nparty of which the proletariat is a lowest minority, while those members\r\nabound who want a seat in Parliament, or in the communal councils and in\r\nthe organisations. It is really a political clique which wishes to\r\nsubstitute itself for the ruling clique. We must not confuse this group\r\nof mediocre politicians with the immense movement of the proletariat\r\nwhich has a reason for its existence, development and brotherhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Against every Idol._ I repeat here what I said before. No demagogism.\r\nWork-worn hands are not yet enough to show that a man is capable of\r\nupholding a State or a family. We must react against these “cajolers”\r\nand these new semi-idols, in order to uplift these people from the moral\r\nand mental slavery into which they have fallen. We must not approach\r\nthem in the attitude of partisans. We are syndicalists, because we think\r\nthat by means of the mass it may be possible to determine an economic\r\nreadjustment, but this readjustment involves long and complicated\r\nconsideration. A political revolution is accomplished in twenty-four\r\nhours, but the economic constitution of a nation, which forms part of\r\nthe world system, is not overturned in twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nBut we do not, by this, mean to be considered as a kind of “bodyguard”\r\nof the bourgeoisie, which, especially where it is composed of the new\r\nrich, is simply unworthy and cowardly. If these people do not know how\r\nto defend themselves, they must not hope for protection from us. We\r\ndefend the nation and the people as a whole. We desire the moral and\r\nmaterial welfare of the people.\r\n\r\nI think that, with this as our attitude, it will be possible to approach\r\nthe masses. In the meantime, the Federation of Seamen has separated\r\nitself from the General Federation of Labour; the railwaymen have proved\r\nin the big strike that they are Italian and wish to be Italian; and\r\nwhile the upper bureaucracy of the public administration is, on the\r\nwhole, in favour of Nitti and Giolitti, the proletariat of the same\r\nadministration tends to sympathise with us. For fifty years generals,\r\ndiplomats, and bureaucrats have been taken from the upper classes and\r\nfrom a certain limited number of persons of rank and position. It is\r\ntime to put an end to all this, if we want to infuse new energy and new\r\nblood into the body of the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_For the Elections._ And now we come to the elections. We must deal with\r\nthem, because whatever happens it is always a good thing to keep\r\ntogether and not to burn one’s boats. It may happen that in this month\r\nof October events may be hurried on at such a rate that the elections\r\nmay be side-tracked. It may be, on the other hand, that they will take\r\nplace. We must be ready also for the second contingency. And then we\r\nFascisti must do our utmost by ourselves, we must come out clearly\r\nmarked and numbered, and if we are few, we must remember that we have\r\nonly been in the world six months. Where there is no probability of\r\nisolated success, a union with the “interveners” of the Left might\r\npossibly be formed, which must vindicate, on the one hand, the utility\r\nof the Italian intervention in the name of humanity and the nation\r\nagainst all those who opposed it, whether followers of Giolitti,\r\nSocialists or Clericals. On the other hand, this programme cannot\r\nexhaust our action; and we shall then have to present to the masses the\r\nfundamental principles upon which we wish to build up a new Italy. Where\r\nthe situation may prove more complicated we might also be able to\r\nidentify ourselves with a group of “interveners” in a wider and fuller\r\nsense of the word.\r\n\r\n\r\n_After Vittorio Veneto._ But we wish, above all, to reaffirm solemnly at\r\nthis meeting of ours the great Italian victory, vindicating it before\r\nall those who wish to deny and forget it.\r\n\r\nWe have subdued an Empire which was our enemy, which had advanced to the\r\nPiave, and whose leaders had endeavoured to overthrow Italy. We now\r\npossess the Brenner, the Julian Alps and Fiume, and all the Italians of\r\nDalmatia. We can say that between the Piave and the Isonzo we have\r\ndestroyed that Empire and determined the fall of four autocracies.\r\n(Enthusiastic applause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE TASKS OF FASCISMO\r\n\r\n      Speech delivered at the Politeama Rossetti at Trieste, 20th\r\n                            September 1920.\r\n\r\n  The following speech may be considered as the first of the series of\r\n  those which belong to the period of elaboration of the Fascista\r\n  programme. The moment chosen was not the most favourable, because it\r\n  coincided with two manifestations equally critical both with regard\r\n  to internal and to foreign policy. We refer to the occupation of the\r\n  factories, then at an acute and threatening stage, and to the\r\n  Legionary occupation of Fiume, the first anniversary of which was\r\n  celebrated at this time.\r\n\r\n  Benito Mussolini, although taking into due account these two\r\n  important events, destined not to be ignored by history, could and\r\n  did rise above the circumstances of the moment. As a far-seeing\r\n  statesman looking forward to resistance and final victory, he drew\r\n  the attention of his hearers to a sane conception of the problems of\r\n  foreign policy, not included in the enterprise of Ronchi, and, at\r\n  the same time, heartening all Italians who were panic-stricken under\r\n  the arrogant tyranny of Social-Bolshevism.\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not consider you, men of Trieste, as Italians to whom the whole\r\ntruth cannot yet be spoken, because I think of you as among the best in\r\nthe country, and your enthusiasm to-day has confirmed me in my opinion.\r\nThe event, which had its counterpart in Rome on the 20th September 1870,\r\nwas a magnificent picture in a poor frame, but upon this I am not going\r\nto dwell.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Comforting Balance._ After a lapse of fifty years since the breach of\r\nPorta Pia, we must undertake the examination of our consciences. A\r\nnation like ours, which had issued from many centuries of disunion,\r\nwhich had barely achieved unity, had not then muscles strong enough to\r\nbear the weight of a world policy. A great Italian thinker[6] broke this\r\ntradition. In fifty years Italy has made marvellous progress. In the\r\nfirst place she has a sure foundation, and that is the vitality of our\r\nrace. There are nations which every year scan the birth-rates with a\r\ncertain preoccupation, because, gentlemen, it is just the want of\r\nbalance in this sphere which produces the great crises—you know to what\r\nI allude. But Italy is not thus preoccupied. Italy had twenty-seven\r\nmillion inhabitants in 1870, she has now fifty million; forty million of\r\nwhom live in the Peninsula, and represent the most homogeneous block in\r\nEurope, because, compared with Bohemia, for instance, where five\r\nmillions of the Czecho race govern seven millions of other races, Italy\r\nhas only 180,000 German subjects on the Upper Adige and 360,000 Slavs,\r\nall the rest forming one compact whole. And besides these forty\r\nmillions, there are ten millions who have emigrated to all the\r\ncontinents and beyond all the oceans; there are 700,000 Italians in New\r\nYork alone, another 400,000 in the state of San Paulo, 900,000 in the\r\nArgentine and 120,000 in Tunis.\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  Francesco Crispi.\r\n\r\n\r\n_National Discipline._ It is a pity that foreigners know us so little,\r\nbut it is still more serious that Italians know Italy so little. If they\r\nknew her a little better, they would realise that there are peoples\r\nbeyond her boundaries who are more retrograde than she is; they would\r\nlearn, for instance, that Italy possesses the most powerful\r\nhydro-electric plant in the world.\r\n\r\nDo not speak to me of reactionary forces in Italy. Those who talk to me\r\nof a reactionary Government make me laugh, especially if they are\r\nimmigrants or renegades from Trieste. Because if there is a country in\r\nthe world where liberty is in danger of degenerating into licence, and\r\nwhere it is the inviolable patrimony of every citizen, it is Italy.\r\nThere has not yet been seen in our country that which has been seen in\r\nFrance, where, as the result of a political strike, the Republic\r\ndissolved the General Confederation of Labour, locked up the leaders and\r\nkeeps them still in prison. Nor have we seen that which has been\r\nwitnessed in England, where so-called undesirable elements are sent over\r\nto the other side of the Channel; or in the ultra-democratic republic of\r\nthe United States, where, in one single night, five hundred rebels were\r\nseized and sent over the Atlantic. If there is something to say, it is\r\nthis: it is time to impose an iron discipline upon the individual and\r\nupon the masses, because social renovation is one thing—and this we are\r\nnot against—but the destruction of the country quite another. As long as\r\ntransformation is spoken of we are all agreed, but when instead it is a\r\nquestion of a leap in the dark, then we put our veto upon it. You will\r\npass, we say, but it will be over our bodies; you will have to overcome\r\nour resistance first.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Greatness of Victory._ Now, after this half-century of the life of\r\nItaly which I have thus roughly sketched, Trieste is Italian and the\r\ntricolour waves over the Brenner. If it were possible to pause one\r\nmoment to measure the greatness of the event, you would find that the\r\nfact of the tricolour on the Brenner is of capital importance, in the\r\nhistory not only of Italy, but also of Europe. The tricolour on the\r\nBrenner means that the Germans will no longer descend with impunity upon\r\nour lands. Glaciers have now been placed between us and them, and on\r\nthese glaciers are the magnificent Alpine soldiers who went to the\r\nassault of Monte Nero, who were sacrificed at Ortigara, and who have on\r\ntheir flag the motto “No passage this way.” (Loud applause.)\r\n\r\nNow it is a most important fact that Trieste has come to Italy after a\r\ngreat victory. If we were not so occupied with the daily material\r\nnecessities of life and the solution of commonplace and banal problems,\r\nwe should know how to appreciate all that which took place on the banks\r\nof the Piave and at Vittorio Veneto. An Empire was destroyed in an hour,\r\nan Empire which had outlasted a century, an Empire in which necessity\r\nhad developed a superfine art of government which consisted in the\r\neternal “Divide et impera,” according to the wisdom of Budapest and\r\nVienna. This Empire had an army, a traditional policy, a bureaucracy,\r\nand had bound all its citizens together in a universal suffrage. This\r\nEmpire, which seemed so powerful and invincible, fell before the\r\nbayonets of the Italian people.\r\n\r\nThe Italian Risorgimento is only a struggle between a people and a\r\nState, between the Italian people on one side and the Hapsburg State on\r\nthe other, between the live forces of the future and the dead past. It\r\nwas inevitable that, having passed the Mincio in 1859, and the Upper\r\nAdige in 1866, we had, in 1915, to pass the Isonzo and get beyond; it\r\nwas so far inevitable that the neutralists themselves have had to\r\nacknowledge that Italy could not, under pain of death, and what is\r\nworse, dishonour, have remained neutral.\r\n\r\nThis vindication of our intervention is the fact which gives us the\r\ngreatest satisfaction. And what does it matter if I read in a gloomy and\r\npessimistic book that the acquisition of Trento, Trieste and Fiume still\r\nrepresents a deficit in the balance of the war? This way of arguing is\r\nridiculous. In the first place, historical events cannot be regulated\r\nlike a page of book-keeping with receipts and payments, debit and\r\ncredit. It is impossible to make out an estimate of historical facts and\r\nexpect it to agree with the final balance.\r\n\r\nAll this is the result of a melancholy philosophy which was widespread\r\nover Italy after the war. But let us hope it will soon pass to leave\r\nroom for a little optimism and pride. This after-war period is certainly\r\ncritical; I fully recognise the fact. But who can expect that a gigantic\r\ncrisis like that of five years of a world-war will be settled at once,\r\nthat the world will return to its previous tranquil state in less than\r\ntwo years? The crisis is not limited to Trieste, Milan or Italy, it is\r\nworld-wide and is not yet over.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Necessity of Struggle._ Struggle is at the bottom of everything,\r\nbecause life is full of contrasts. There is love and hate, black and\r\nwhite, night and day, good and evil, and until these contrasts are\r\nbalanced, struggle will always be at the root of human nature, as the\r\nsupreme fatality. And it is a good thing that it is so. To-day there may\r\nbe war, economic rivalry and conflicting ideas, but the day in which all\r\nstruggle will cease will be a day of melancholy, will mean the end of\r\nall things, will mean ruin. Now this day will not come, because history\r\npresents itself as a changing panorama. An attempt to return to peace\r\nand tranquillity would mean fighting against the existing dynamic\r\nperiod. It is necessary to prepare ourselves for other surprises and\r\nstruggles. “There will not be a period of peace,” they say, “unless the\r\nnations indulge in a dream of universal brotherhood and stretch out\r\ntheir hands beyond the mountains and the oceans.” I, for my part, do not\r\nput too much faith in these ideals, but I do not exclude them, because I\r\nnever exclude anything; everything is possible, even the impossible and\r\nabsurd. But to-day, being to-day, it would be fallacious, criminal and\r\ndangerous to build our houses on the quicksands of international\r\nChristian-Socialist-Communism. These ideas are very respectable, but a\r\nlong way from the truth. (Applause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Patriotism of Fascismo._ What is the position of Fascismo in this\r\ndifficult post-war period? The foundation-stone of Fascismo is\r\npatriotism; that is to say, we are proud of being Italian. Now it is\r\njust this which separates us from a great many other people, who are so\r\nridiculous and small and hide their patriotism, because eighty per cent.\r\nof the Italian population was once illiterate. This does not mean\r\nanything, for narrow, poor, elementary education may be worse than pure\r\nand simple illiteracy. It is an outworn idea that one who knows how to\r\nwrite must needs be more intelligent than one who does not know how to.\r\n\r\nNow we vindicate the honour of being Italian, because in our wonderful\r\nPeninsula—wonderful, although there are inhabitants who are not always\r\nwonderful—there has been enacted the most marvellous story of humanity.\r\nDo you think that a man who lives in far Japan or in America or in any\r\nother far-off spot can be counted educated if he does not know the\r\nhistory of Rome? It is not possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rome._ Rome is the name which filled history for twenty centuries. Rome\r\ngave the lead to universal civilisation, traced the roads and assigned\r\nthe boundaries; Rome gave the world the laws of its immutable rights.\r\nBut if this was the universal task of Rome in ancient times, we have now\r\nanother universal task. Our destiny cannot become universal unless it is\r\ntransplanted to the pagan ground of Rome. By means of Paganism Rome\r\nfound her form and found the means of upholding herself in the world.\r\n\r\nNote that the task of Rome is not yet completed. No! Because the story\r\nof Italy of the Middle Ages—the most brilliant story of Venice, which\r\nlasted for ten centuries, with her ships in all seas and her ambassadors\r\nand her government, the like of which is no longer to be found to-day—is\r\nnot closed. The story of the Italian communes is full of wonders,\r\ngrandeur and nobility. Go to Venice, Pisa, Amalfi, Genoa and Florence,\r\nand you will find in the palaces and in the streets the signs and\r\nvestiges of this marvellous and not yet decayed civilisation.\r\n\r\nNow, my friends, after this period, in the beginning of 1800, when Italy\r\nwas divided into seven little States, there arose a generation of poets.\r\nPoetry also has its task to perform in history, in arousing enthusiasm\r\nand in kindling faith, and not for nothing the greatest modern Italian\r\npoet—whether second-rate writers, who do not know how to express the\r\nsmallest idea, recognise it or not—Gabriele d’Annunzio, represents in a\r\nmagnificent union of thought and sentiment, the power of action which is\r\ncharacteristic of the Italian people.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Dolomites of Italian Thought._ We are proud of being Italians, and\r\nnot only for reasons of exclusivism. The modern spirit reaches out\r\ntowards beauty and truth. One cannot think of a modern man who has not\r\nread Cervantes, Shakespeare, Goethe and Tolstoy. But all this must not\r\nmake us forget that we were great when the others were not yet born,\r\nthat while German Klopstock was writing his verbose _Messiade_, Dante\r\nAlighieri had been a giant for centuries. And we have also the sculpture\r\nof Michelangelo, the painting of Raffaello, the astronomy of Galileo,\r\nand the medicine of Morgagni, and with these the mysterious Leonardo da\r\nVinci who excelled in all fields. And then, if you want to pass to\r\npolitics and war, there is Napoleon and, above all, Garibaldi, most\r\nItalian of all.\r\n\r\nThese are the Dolomites of Italian thought and spirit; but beside these\r\nalmost inaccessible peaks are lower summits in great numbers, which show\r\nthat it is quite impossible to think of human civilisation without the\r\ngigantic contribution made by Italian thought. And this must be repeated\r\nat our boundaries, where there are tribes chattering incomprehensible\r\nlanguages who would pretend, simply on account of their numbers, to\r\nsupplant our marvellous civilisation which has endured two millenniums\r\nand is ready for a third.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Sincerity of Fascismo._ The second foundation-stone of Fascismo is\r\nrepresented by anti-demagogism and pragmatism. We have no preconceived\r\nnotions, no fixed ideas and, above all, no stupid pride. Those who say,\r\n“You are unhappy, here is the receipt for happiness,” make me think of\r\nthe advertisement “Do you want health?” We do not promise men happiness\r\neither here or in the next world; differing thus from the Socialists,\r\nwho pretend that they can set the Russian mask on the face of the\r\nMediterranean.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce there were courtiers who burned incense before the king and the\r\npopes; now there is a new breed, which burns incense, without sincerity,\r\nbefore the proletariat. Only those who hold Italy in their hands have\r\nthe right to govern her, they say, while these do not know even how to\r\ncontrol their own families. We are different. We use another language,\r\nmore serious, unprejudiced and worthy of free men. We do not exclude the\r\npossibility that the proletariat may be capable of using its present\r\nforces to other ends, but we say that before it tries to govern the\r\nnation it must learn to govern itself, must make itself worthy,\r\ntechnically and, still more, morally, because government is a\r\ntremendously difficult and complicated task. The nation is composed of\r\nmillions and millions of individuals whose interests clash, and there\r\nare no superior beings who can reconcile all these differences and make\r\na union of life and progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fascismo is not Conservative._ But we are not, on the other hand,\r\ntraditionalists, bound hand and foot to the stones and débris.\r\nEverything must be changed in the modern city. The ancient streets will\r\nno longer stand the wear and tear of the trams and motor traffic,\r\nbecause through them passes the whole of civilisation. It is possible to\r\ndestroy in order to create anew in a form more beautiful and great, for\r\ndestruction must never be carried out in the method of a savage, who\r\nbreaks open a machine in order to see what is inside. We do not refuse\r\nto make changes in our spiritual life just because the spirit is a\r\ndelicate matter. No social transformation which is necessary, is\r\nrepugnant to me. In this way I accept the famous control of the\r\nfactories and also their co-operative management by companies; I only\r\nask that there shall be a clear conscience and technical capacity, and\r\nthat there shall be increased production. If this is guaranteed by the\r\nworkmen’s unions, instead of by the employers, I have no hesitation in\r\nsaying that the former have the right to substitute the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Bolshevist Mask._ That which we Fascisti are opposing is the\r\nBolshevist element in Italian Socialism. It is strange that a race which\r\nhas produced Pisacane and Mazzini should go in search of gospels first\r\nto Germany and then to Russia. Pisacane and Mazzini ought to be studied,\r\nand then it would be seen that some of the truths which it is pretended\r\nhave been revealed in Russia, are only truths already consecrated in the\r\nbooks of our great Italian thinkers.\r\n\r\nHow can Communism be thought possible in the most individualistic\r\ncountry in the world? It is only possible where every man is a number,\r\nnot in Italy where every man is an individual, and more, has\r\nindividuality. But after all, my dear friends, does Bolshevism exist in\r\nRussia? It does not any longer. There are no longer councils of the\r\nfactories, but dictators of the factories; no longer eight hours of\r\nwork, but twelve; no longer equal salaries, but thirty-five different\r\ncategories, not according to need, but according to merit. There is not\r\nin Russia even that liberty which there is in Italy. Is there a\r\ndictatorship of the proletariat? No! Is there a dictatorship of the\r\nSocialists? No! There is a dictatorship of a few intelligent men, not\r\nworkmen, who belong to a section of the Socialist Party, and their\r\ndictatorship is opposed by all the other sections.\r\n\r\nThis dictatorship of a few men is what is called Bolshevism. Now we do\r\nnot want this in Italy. The Socialists themselves, realising what they\r\nhave seen in Russia, recognise, when you question them, that that which\r\nhas gone badly in Russia cannot be transplanted into Italy. Only they\r\nare wrong in not saying so openly; they are wrong in playing with\r\nequivocations and deceiving the masses. We repeat, we are not against\r\nthe working classes, because they are necessary to the nation, sacredly\r\nnecessary. The twenty million Italians who work with their hands have\r\nthe right to defend their interests. What we oppose is the deceitful\r\naction of politicians to the detriment of the working classes; we fight\r\nthese new priests who promise, in bad faith, a paradise they do not\r\nbelieve in themselves. Those who are the most ardent advocates of\r\nBolshevism here in Trieste take up this attitude in order to make\r\nthemselves popular with the Slav masses who live near. And if I have a\r\nprofound lack of esteem for the Bolshevist leaders in Italy, and despise\r\nmany of them, it is because I know them all well and have been in\r\ncontact with them. I know perfectly well that when they play the lion\r\nthey are rabbits, and that they are like certain monks in Heinrich Heine\r\nwho openly preach the drinking of water and drink wine themselves in\r\nsecret. We wish to see this shameful speculation finish, because it is\r\nagainst the interests of the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Always against Italy._ Can you tell me by what curious chance the\r\nSocialists are always against Italy in all questions? Can you tell me\r\nwhy they always side with those who are against Italy? With the\r\nAlbanians, the Croats, the Germans and others? Can you tell me why they\r\nshout “Long live Albania!” who is fighting for Valona, which is\r\nAlbanian, and do not shout “Long live Italy!” who is fighting for Trento\r\nand Trieste, which are Italian? By what criterion are they always\r\nagainst Italy, shouting, “Down, down!” Four Arabs revolt in Libya and\r\nthey shout, “Down with Libya!” Six thousand Albanians attack Valona and\r\nit is, “Down with Valona!” And if to-morrow the Croats of Dalmatia\r\nattack us it will be, “Down with Dalmatia!” And if, upon the burning\r\nmountain of the Carso, an insurrectional movement develops against\r\nTrieste, I am afraid the Italian Socialists would cry, “Down with\r\nTrieste!” But there are Italians here and elsewhere who would strangle\r\nthe fratricidal cry in their throats.\r\n\r\nIt was the same with their opposition to the war. War is a horrible\r\nthing in itself. Those who have been through it know. But it is\r\nnecessary to explain. If they say, “War in itself and for itself, for\r\nwhatever reason, in whatever latitude, under whatsoever pretext, must\r\nnot be made,” then I respect these humanitarians and Tolstoyans. If they\r\nsay, “I abhor that blood shall be spilled under any pretext,” then I\r\nrespect them and admire them, although I find this impracticable. But\r\nwhen they cry, “Down with the war!” when Italy makes it, and “Long live\r\nthe war!” when Russia makes it, it is a different matter. They had a\r\npaper which was very happy when the so-called Bolshevists were marching\r\ntowards Warsaw, and employed the military style: “While we are writing\r\nthe cannons....” etc.; we know it all by heart. Is not this war then the\r\nsame thing? Does not the Russian war make widows and orphans? Is it not\r\nmade with guns, aeroplanes and all the innumerable instruments which\r\ntear and kill human bodies? Either they must be contrary to _all_ wars,\r\nin which case we can discuss together, or if they make distinctions\r\nbetween war and war, between the war which can be made and the war which\r\ncannot—well, we can tell them that their humanitarianism is simply\r\nhorrible. And if they have reason to make war, we had reason to make it\r\nfor the destinies of the country in 1915. (Applause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Epic of D’Annunzio._ What, then, is to be the task of Fascismo? It\r\nis this: to bridle Demagogism with courage, energy and impetuosity.\r\nFascismo is called the Fascio of Fighters, and the word “fighters” does\r\nnot leave any doubts about its aims, which are, to fight with peaceful\r\narms, but also with the arms of warriors. And this is normal in Italy,\r\nbecause all the world is arming itself, and so it is absolutely\r\nnecessary that we Italians arm ourselves in our turn.\r\n\r\nBut the task of Fascismo here is more delicate, more difficult, and more\r\nnecessary. Fascismo here has a reason for existence, and finds a natural\r\nfield for development. I have unlimited faith in the future of the\r\nItalian nation. Crises will succeed crises, there will be pauses and\r\nparentheses, but we shall arrive at a settlement, and the history of\r\nto-morrow cannot be thought of without the participation of Italy.\r\n\r\nThere have been many orders of the day, many articles in the papers,\r\nmuch more or less senseless talk, but the only man who has achieved a\r\nreal revolutionary stroke, the only man who for twelve or thirteen\r\nmonths has held in check all the forces ranged against him is Gabriele\r\nd’Annunzio with his legionaries. Against this man, of pure Italian\r\nblood, are leagued all the cowards, and it is for this reason that we\r\nare proud to be with him, even if all this tribe turn against us too.\r\nThis man also represents the possibility of victory and resurrection.\r\nAnd this possibility exists because we have made war and won. It is\r\nridiculous that those who most profited by it in wages, votes and\r\nhonours are those who, to-day, turn round and revile it. In any case I\r\nthink, as indeed this meeting of yours bears witness, that the hour of\r\nthe vindication of our national efficiency has struck. While on the one\r\nhand there is a vast world of wretched, poor creatures, there is also a\r\nworld which does not forget and does not ignore our victory. (Applause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Re-birth of Ideals._ Just as I was leaving Milan, I received from\r\nthe mayor of Cupra Marittima, a little town of Central Italy, an\r\ninvitation to be present at their commemoration of the fallen. I did not\r\naccept, because I do not like making speeches. But this episode, like\r\nthe pilgrimage of the Ortigara, the pilgrimage to the Grappa, the\r\npilgrimage of the 24th October to the rocky Carso, tells you that all\r\nideals are not lost, but are, on the contrary, being re-born. We wish to\r\nassist this spiritual re-birth in every way possible.\r\n\r\nYesterday, I experienced a moment of great emotion when passing over the\r\nIsonzo. Every time that I have passed that river with my pack on my\r\nback, I have stooped to drink of its crystal waters. If we had not\r\nreached the other side of that river, the tricolour would not to-day be\r\nflying from San Giusto.\r\n\r\nThis is the real and true meaning of the war. If the tricolour flies\r\nfrom San Giusto, it is because twenty years ago a man of Trieste was the\r\nforerunner; it is there because in 1915 Italian soldiers threw\r\nthemselves upon the Austrian defences, and all Italy took part in that\r\nact, from the Alpine detachments of the mountains of Piedmont, Lombardy\r\nand Friuli to the magnificent infantry of the Abruzzi, Puglie and Sicily\r\nand the soldiers of the generous island of Sardinia, too much neglected\r\nby the Government! And these generous sons have not yet risen up to take\r\nreprisals against the demagogues of Italy, because they are always ready\r\nto fulfil their duty.\r\n\r\nMen of Trieste! The tricolour of San Giusto is sacred, the tricolour on\r\nthe Nevoso is sacred, and still more so is that on the Dinaric Alps. The\r\ntricolour will be protected by our dead heroes, but let us swear\r\ntogether that it will be defended also by the living. (Prolonged\r\napplause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              FASCISMO AND THE PROBLEMS OF FOREIGN POLICY\r\n\r\n   Speech delivered at the Politeama Rossetti, Trieste, 6th February\r\n                                 1921.\r\n\r\n  Just as, a few months before, at the time of Italy’s darkest hour,\r\n  when the Bolshevist movement was at its zenith, Mussolini had\r\n  addressed to the people of Trieste wise words of faith, so in the\r\n  spring of 1921, the spring famous for anti-Socialist reaction,\r\n  Trieste was once more the city he chose as the place best suited for\r\n  the exposition of his analysis of the problems of foreign policy. On\r\n  that occasion the patriotic and liberated town, which gave the first\r\n  impulse of assault in the energetic offensive against the local\r\n  Austrian Bolshevists, accorded to the leader of the new Italy hearty\r\n  manifestations of general assent.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to indicate the direction which Italian foreign policy should\r\ntake in the immediate future, it is a good thing to give a glance first\r\nat the general situation in the world, and at the forces and currents\r\nwhich are at work, with a view to finding out what may be the possible\r\ndevelopments and results.\r\n\r\nAll the States of the world are in a condition of fatal interdependence.\r\nThe period for splendid isolation is passed for everyone. It can well be\r\nsaid, that with the war the story of mankind has acquired a world\r\nmovement. While Europe, severely weakened, struggles to recover her\r\neconomic, political and spiritual balance, already beyond the boundaries\r\nof the old Continent a formidable clash of interests is shaping itself.\r\nI allude to the conflict between the United States and Japan, and to the\r\naccounts of recent episodes, from the Affair of the Cable to the Bill\r\nagainst the Yellow Immigration in California, which have occupied the\r\npapers. Japan has a population of 77 millions, and the United States 110\r\nmillions. That it was known that a struggle between these two States was\r\ninevitable is proved by the very significant fact that the book which\r\nhad the widest circulation among all classes in Tokio was called _Our\r\nNext War with the United States_, a book which outlined the war between\r\nthe continents for the dominion of the Pacific. The centre of world\r\ncivilisation is tending to alter its position. Up to about 1500 it was\r\nin the Mediterranean; after the discovery of America, it shifted to the\r\nAtlantic; to-day its passage to the biggest ocean of the planet is\r\nindicated. I said, last time I spoke here, that we were approaching the\r\n“Asiatic” century. Japan is destined to be the fermenting element of all\r\nthe Yellow world.\r\n\r\nAs the result of shifting the centre of civilisation from London to New\r\nYork (which has already seven million inhabitants and will soon be the\r\nlargest agglomeration of human beings on the earth), and from the\r\nAtlantic to the Pacific, there are those who foresee a gradual economic\r\nand spiritual decay of our old Europe, and of our wonderful little\r\ncontinent, which has been, hitherto, the guiding light of all the world.\r\nShall we live to see the eclipse of the European rôle in the history of\r\nmankind?\r\n\r\n\r\n_The European Situation._ To this disquieting and depressing question we\r\nanswer, “It is possible.” The life of Europe, especially that of Central\r\nEurope, is at the mercy of the Americans. Europe presents a troubled\r\npolitical and economic panorama, a thorny maze of national and social\r\nquestions, and it happens that Communism is sometimes the mask of\r\nNationalism and _vice versâ_. European “unity” does not seem to be any\r\nnearer realisation. Egoism and the interests of nations and classes\r\nexist in proud contrast. Russia is no longer an enigma from the economic\r\npoint of view. In Russia there is neither Communism nor Socialism, but\r\nan agrarian revolution of the democratic lower-middle-class kind. She\r\nonly remains an enigma from the political point of view. What foreign\r\npolicy does Russia follow? Is it a policy of peace or war? The variety\r\nof facts which reach our ears make us continually waver between one\r\nopinion and another. Perhaps under the emblem of the sickle and the\r\nhammer is hidden—or not hidden—the old Panslavism, which to-day is\r\ndominated, besides, by the immediate necessity of extending the\r\nrevolution to the rest of Europe, in order to save the Government of the\r\nSoviet in Russia. If Russia adopts a policy of war, the fate of the\r\nBaltic States (Lithuania, Lettonia and Esthonia) will be sealed. The\r\nfate of Poland would also be uncertain, and she might find herself\r\ndriven against the unfriendly German wall by an eventual breaking loose\r\nof the Russian forces. There are serious conflicting interests between\r\nthe different States of those north-east shores. There is a disagreement\r\nbetween Poland, Lithuania and Russia as regards Wilna and Grodno. The\r\nrights on the basis of history and statistics are with Poland. There are\r\n263,000 Poles in the district of Wilna as compared with 118,000\r\nLithuanians, 8000 White Ruthenians and 83,000 Jews. The same figures,\r\nproportionately, are found in Grodno. As for Upper Silesia, which keeps\r\nthe Polish and German worlds in a state of continuous agitation, the\r\nGerman statistics give these returns: 1,348,000 Poles, 588,000 Germans.\r\nUpper Silesia is, therefore, Polish, but its final destiny will be\r\ndecided by the plebiscite summoned for the 15th March.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Treaties of Peace._ The Great War has resulted in six treaties of\r\npeace up to the present: Versailles, St. Germain, Trianon, Neuilly,\r\nSèvres, Rapallo. Not one of these treaties has wholly satisfied the\r\nvictors; not one, even the Treaty of Rapallo, which was supposed to be a\r\nmasterpiece of friendly and peaceful negotiation, has been accepted by\r\nthe vanquished. As far as the Treaty of Versailles, the greatest of all,\r\nis concerned, even at this moment the important question of the\r\nindemnity which Germany ought to pay is still under discussion. It is a\r\nfigure which makes us feel giddy and the last word has not yet been\r\nsaid. All the settlements, especially those made by diplomats, have an\r\nironically provisional character.\r\n\r\nThe Germans, who have formed the “sacred union” of non-payment, announce\r\nthat they will make counterproposals by the same representatives who\r\nwill speak at London in a few weeks’ time. Our opinion is, that if the\r\nGermans can pay they ought, as far as it is possible, and the experts\r\nmust ascertain the truth of this possibility. We must not forget, before\r\nallowing ourselves to pity the Germans—who had already fixed our\r\nindemnity at 500 milliards of gold, in the case of their victory—that it\r\nwas the Germans who began the war, and that the first Irredentism was\r\ndirected against Italy, on account of those minorities which had\r\ndescended, without right, into the Upper Adige.\r\n\r\n\r\n_German Austria, Macedonia and Smyrna._ The present Austrian Republic\r\nwas the result of the Treaty of St. Germain. Can it continue to live,\r\nformed as it is at present? It is generally thought not. There remains\r\nthe alternative of a Danube Confederation with its centre at Vienna and\r\nBudapest, but the “Little Entente” sees to it that there shall be no\r\nreturn, under any form, of the old régime. We think that, by the force\r\nof events, an economic Danube Confederation will be formed sooner or\r\nlater, in which case the conditions of Austria, and especially of\r\nVienna, would improve until she had arrived at the point of lessening\r\nthe pro-German annexationist movement. From the standpoint of justice,\r\nand whenever there was a clear manifestation of the will of the people,\r\nAustria would have the right of separating herself from Germany. This\r\npossible eventuality cannot leave us indifferent, because of the\r\nboundaries of the Brenner, which is a question of life or death for the\r\nPaduan valley. A hungry and pauper Austria cannot organise a dangerous\r\nIrredentism against us; but as the result of union with Germany the\r\nquestion of the Upper Adige would certainly become more acute.\r\n\r\nAs for Hungary, she can certainly expect a revision of the treaty which\r\nmutilates her on every side. It must be added, however, that the chapter\r\nof Fiume is definitely closed in Hungarian history.\r\n\r\nCentres of infection for another war exist all over the Balkan world.\r\nLet us quote Montenegro and Albania, for example. We are in favour of\r\nthe independence of both these States, provided that they show\r\nthemselves capable of enjoying it. Bulgaria has a right to Macedonia[7]\r\nand also to a port on the Ægean. And this is of capital importance for\r\nthe economic expansion of Italy in Bulgaria. The Treaty of Sèvres\r\ncrushed Turkey in order to exalt the Greece of Venizelos and\r\nConstantine, which gave the European war the sacrifice of 787 “euzoni.”\r\nWe consider, as far as the Eastern Mediterranean is concerned, that\r\nItaly, on the whole, should follow a pro-Turkish policy.\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\n  Population: 1,181,000 Bulgarians, 499,000 Turks, and 228,000 Greeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Treaty of Rapallo._ Immediately after the signing of the Treaty of\r\nRapallo, the Central Committee of the Fascio passed its judgment upon\r\nit, finding it “acceptable for the Eastern boundaries, inacceptable and\r\ndeficient as regards Fiume, and insufficient and to be rejected as\r\nregards Zara and Dalmatia.” At three months’ distance this judgment does\r\nnot seem to be contradicted by successive events. The Treaty of Rapallo\r\nis an unhappy compromise, against which pages of criticism were printed\r\nin the _Popolo d’Italia_, which it is now useless to repeat.\r\n\r\nIt must be explained why victorious Italy ever arrived at the point of\r\nsigning the Peace of Rapallo. And the explanations do not need much\r\nmental exertion. Rapallo was the logical consequence of the line of\r\nforeign policy followed by us or imposed upon us before, during and\r\nafter the war. It is explained by Wilson and his so-called experts and\r\nthe absolute lack of Italian propaganda abroad and the dead-tiredness of\r\nthe people. Rapallo is explained by the meeting of the oppressed\r\nnationalities held at Rome in April 1918, which meeting can be directly\r\nconnected with the ill-fated story of Caporetto. Everything is paid for\r\nin this life. On 12th November 1920, we paid at Rapallo for the\r\nbreakdown of 24th October 1917. Had there been no Caporetto, there would\r\nhave been no Pact of Rome. In that congress the Yugoslavs threw dust in\r\nour eyes because in reality they did nothing towards breaking up the\r\nDual Monarchy from within, of which they were the faithful slaves to the\r\nlast, with traditional Croat loyalty. Not for nothing did the Hapsburg\r\nmonarchy, upon its decease, try to present the Jugoslavs with its navy.\r\nBut it was in the April of 1918 that the irreparable was committed, with\r\nthe consent of all currents of Italian public opinion, including ours\r\nand the Nationalists—that is to say, our worst enemies were raised to\r\nthe rank of effectual and powerful allies, and naturally, when the\r\nvictory was obtained, there was no accepting of the rôle of vanquished,\r\nbut they adopted that of co-operators with a relative share in the\r\ncommon booty. After the Pact of Rome it was no longer possible to place\r\nour knee on the chest of Yugoslavia—this is the truth. And so it\r\nhappened that the Italian people—tired, impoverished and unnerved by two\r\nlong years of useless negotiations, demoralised by the policy of the\r\nGovernment and the tremendous wave of after-war sabotage (against which\r\nonly the Fascisti reacted powerfully)—accepted, or rather suffered, the\r\nTreaty of Rapallo, without manifestations of grief or joy. And, in order\r\nto finish it once and for all, many people would also have accepted the\r\nterrible line of Montemaggiore. All the parties of all the grades of\r\nLeft and Right accepted the treaty as a lesser evil. We, too, submitted\r\nto it, considering it merely as a transitory and ephemeral act (has\r\nthere ever been anything definite in the world, much less upon the\r\nmoving sands of diplomacy?), and with the intention of gathering our\r\nforces to be ready for the revision which, sooner or later, would\r\nimprove the treaty and not make it worse, would carry our boundaries to\r\nthe Dinaric Alps, but never again allow the boundaries of Yugoslavia to\r\nreach the Isonzo.\r\n\r\nThe fate meted out to Dalmatia makes us very sad. But the fault does not\r\nlie wholly with the negotiators of the eleventh hour; the renunciation\r\nhad already been made in Parliament, in the papers and in the\r\nuniversities themselves, where a professor printed a book, which was\r\nnaturally translated at Zagabria, in which he proved, in his own way,\r\nthat Dalmatia is not Italian. The Dalmatian tragedy lies in this\r\nignorance, bad faith and want of understanding; faults which we hope to\r\nrepair with our work by making Dalmatia known, loved and defended.\r\n\r\nThe treaty, once signed, could be annulled in one of two ways: by\r\noutside war or internal revolution. Both equally absurd. You do not make\r\nthe people throng the squares in order to change a peace treaty after\r\nfive years of bloodshed. Nobody is capable of working such prodigies. It\r\nwas possible to cause a revolution in Italy in order to obtain\r\nintervention; but to cause a revolution in November 1920, in order to\r\nannul a peace treaty which, good or bad, had been accepted by\r\nninety-nine per cent. of the Italian people, could not be considered. I\r\ndo not mind much about coherence, but there are stenographic records\r\nwhich bear witness to the fact that I steadily refused to go against the\r\ntreaty either by promoting outside war or internal revolution. I\r\nconsidered that it was also dangerous to get mixed up in an armed\r\nresistance to the treaty.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Tragedy of Fiume._ Two months of polemics and daily articles during\r\nNovember and December bear witness to my support of the cause of Fiume,\r\nand my open and strong opposition to the Parliament.\r\n\r\nIt is a pity that oblivion falls so quickly on the words of a daily\r\npaper; and I have not the melancholy habit of unearthing what I publish.\r\nBut the undeniable truth is this: that day after day I fought so that\r\nthe Government at Rome should recognise the Government at Fiume; so that\r\nthe representatives of the Regency should be invited to Rapallo; and so\r\nthat the Government at Rome should avoid any armed attack on Fiume. At\r\nthe outset I called the attack of Christmas Eve an enormous crime, and I\r\nalways upheld the spirit of justice, liberty and free-will which were\r\nthe inspiration of the legions of Ronchi.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Audience in the Gallery._ It sometimes happens in history as in the\r\ntheatre, that there is an audience in the gallery, which, having paid\r\nfor its tickets, demands that the performance shall run to a close at\r\nall costs. Thus in Italy to-day there are two types of individuals:\r\nthose who blame D’Annunzio for having lived to see the end of the Fiume\r\ntragedy, and those who blame Mussolini for not having brought about that\r\neasy, pretty little thing which is called a revolution! I have always\r\ndisdained the cowardly method by which, in Italy, impotence, anger and\r\nmisery are laid upon the heads of real or imaginary scapegoats. The\r\nFasci had never promised to bring about revolution in the event of an\r\nattack on Fiume, nor have I ever written or made known to D’Annunzio\r\nthat revolution depended upon my caprice. Revolution is not a\r\nJack-in-the-box which can be worked at will. I do not carry it in my\r\npocket, any more than those who fill their noisy mouths with its name\r\nand in practice do not get beyond disorders in the squares after\r\nunimportant demonstrations accompanied by a providential arrest to avoid\r\nany more serious complications. I know the breed. I have been in\r\npolitics for twenty years. In the war between Caviglia and Fiume, either\r\ngreat things should have been accomplished, or else, for reasons of\r\nself-respect, excessive shouting and raising of smoke, which vanished at\r\nonce without trace and without bloodshed, should have been avoided.\r\n\r\n\r\n_With Whom and Where?_ History learned from far-off events teaches men\r\nlittle; but that which we see written daily under our eyes ought to be\r\nmore successful. Now these chronicles of every day tell us that\r\nrevolution is made with an army and not against an army; with arms, not\r\nwithout arms; with movements of trained squadrons, not with the\r\nuntrained masses called to meetings in the squares. They succeed when\r\nthey are made in an atmosphere of sympathy on the part of the majority;\r\nif this is lacking they die down and fail. Now in Fiume the army and\r\nnavy did not fail. A certain revolutionary spirit of the eleventh hour\r\ndid not take definite shape; it was the work sometimes of anarchists and\r\nsometimes of Nationalists. According to some emissaries it was possible\r\nto put the devil and holy water together, the nation and that which was\r\nagainst the nation: Misiano and Del Croix. Now I reject all forms of\r\nBolshevism, but if I were obliged to choose one, I should choose that of\r\nMoscow and Lenin, if for no other reason because at least it has\r\ngigantic, barbaric and universal proportions. What revolution was it to\r\nbe, then? National or Bolshevist? A great uncertainty, complicated by a\r\ngreat many minor considerations, confused men’s minds, while the nation,\r\nin a mood of revolt against that which had happened round Fiume,\r\nabandoned itself to an attitude of grief, in which the only bright spot\r\nwas the hope that the episode would retain its local character and come\r\nquickly to a peaceful conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hypotheses and Certainties._ If there had been an insurrection on our\r\npart—and this was not possible owing to the armed forces which the\r\nGovernment had at its disposal—there must have been one of two results:\r\ndefeat or victory. In the first case, everything would have been\r\nirretrievably lost in the abyss of civil war. Let us, for the sake of\r\nargument, presuppose the second hypothesis: that of victory with the\r\nfall of the Government and of the régime. After the more or less easy\r\nperiod of demolition, what form would the revolution take? Social, as\r\nsome Bolshevists wish—those with the motto “Always further Left,” the\r\nequivalent of the grotesque “Go to the reddest”—or national, Dalmatian\r\nand reactionary, as others desire?\r\n\r\nThere is no possibility of reconciliation between the two currents. In a\r\nrevolution of the social order, what importance would the territorial\r\nquestions, and more precisely that of Dalmatia, have had? In the other\r\nevent of a national revolution against the Treaty of Rapallo, everything\r\nwould have been limited to a formal annulment of the treaty and to a\r\nsubstitution of men; to be followed later by another treaty in another\r\nRapallo, in order that one day or another the nation might have her\r\npeace. An episode of civil war was not remedied by letting loose a\r\nbigger war in times like these through which we are passing, and nobody\r\nis capable of prolonging and creating artificially historical situations\r\nwhich are over and done with. Only the man who knows how to lift himself\r\nabove common passions, who knows how to draw conclusions from\r\nconflicting elements and how to distinguish the pure grain from the\r\nequivocal chaff, is able to understand that Fiume Christmas, which can\r\nbe called the tragic crossroads between the reasons of the State and of\r\nthe ideal: the meeting-place of all our deficiencies and all our\r\ngreatness.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Suspended Problems._ The first is that of Fiume. We do not feel the\r\nnecessity of reaffirming our sympathy for the sacrificed city. We have\r\ngiven the most tangible proofs, recently, of our solidarity with the\r\nFascio of Fiume, in order to put it in a position to undertake the\r\nstruggle against the Croats, who are now beginning to show signs of\r\nlife. The action of the Fascisti must tend, for the moment, towards\r\neconomic annexation of Fiume to Italy, to arousing the interest of the\r\nGovernment and private individuals, and at the same time keeping alive,\r\nby every means, the torch of Italy, so that in due time economic will be\r\nfollowed by political annexation. We shall achieve this in spite of\r\neverything. All the Fascista force, national and parliamentary, must be\r\nconcentrated on Zara, so that the little city shall be able to\r\naccomplish her important and delicate mission in history. There must be\r\nefficacious education for the Italians who have remained in the\r\nprincipal cities of Dalmatia, and no separate constituencies for the\r\nSlavs in Istria and the Germans in the Upper Adige. It is not possible\r\nto establish such a precedent, as it would carry us far. The French of\r\nthe Val d’Aosta, who are in reality excellent Italians, have no special\r\nconstituencies and privileges of that sort. These duplicate\r\nconstituencies would be a grave mistake. It is up to the Fascisti of\r\nTrento and Trieste to prevent this happening at any cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Old and New Directions._ The lines of the programme laid down at the\r\nmeeting at Milan in May last year have not become out of date or in need\r\nof revision. Fascismo has the name of being “imperialist.” This\r\naccusation goes together with that of being reactionary. Fascismo is\r\nagainst renunciations when they mean humiliation and diminution.\r\n\r\nGiven these general premises—_first_, that Fascismo does not believe in\r\nthe principles of the so-called League of Nations nor in its vitality;\r\n_secondly_, that Fascismo does not believe in the Red Internationals,\r\nwhich die, reproduce themselves, multiply and die again: for they are\r\nsmall, artificial organisations, small minorities compared to the masses\r\nof the population, which, living, dying, progressing or retrogressing,\r\nfinishes by deciding those changes of interests before which the\r\ninternational organisations of the first, second and third order crumble\r\nto pieces; _thirdly_, that Fascismo does not believe in the immediate\r\npossibility of general disarmament, and _fourthly_, considers that\r\nItaly, in the present historical period, should follow a policy of\r\nEuropean equilibrium and conciliation—it follows that the Italian Fascio\r\nof Fighters demands:—\r\n\r\n1. That the treaties of peace shall be revised and modified in those\r\nparts which have proved inapplicable, or which might prove in\r\napplication the cause of formidable hatred and new wars.\r\n\r\n2. The economic annexation of Fiume to Italy, or the care of the\r\nItalians resident in Dalmatia.\r\n\r\n3. The gradual economic emancipation of Italy from abroad by the\r\ndevelopment of her productive forces.\r\n\r\n4. The renewal of relations with the enemy countries—Austria, Germany,\r\nBulgaria, Turkey and Hungary—but with dignity and holding fast to the\r\nsupreme necessity of maintaining our northern and eastern boundaries.\r\n\r\n5. The creation and intensification of friendly relations with the\r\npeoples of the East, not excluding those governed by the Soviet and\r\nSouth-eastern Europe.\r\n\r\n6. The vindication of the rights and interests of the nation as regards\r\nthe colonies.\r\n\r\n7. The abandonment of the old systems and the replacement of all our\r\ndiplomatic representatives with others from the special university\r\nfaculties.\r\n\r\n8. The furtherance of the Italian colonies in the Mediterranean and\r\nbeyond the Atlantic by economic and educational means and by rapid\r\ncommunications.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Towards a New Italy._ I have enormous faith in the future greatness of\r\nthe Italian people. Ours is the most numerous and homogeneous of the\r\npeoples of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe war has enormously increased the prestige of Italy. “Long live\r\nItaly!” is now cried in far-off Lettonia and still more distant Georgia.\r\n\r\nItaly is the tricolour wing of Ferrarin, the magnetic wave of Marconi,\r\nthe baton of Toscanini, the revival of Dante, in the sixth centenary of\r\nhis departure. Let us prepare ourselves by energetic everyday work for\r\nthe Italy of to-morrow of which we dream; an Italy free and rich,\r\nresounding with song, with her skies and seas populated with her fleets,\r\nand her earth fruitful beneath her ploughs. And may the coming citizens\r\nbe able to say what Virgil said of ancient Rome: “Imperium oceano, famam\r\nterminavit astris” (The Empire ended with the ocean, but her fame\r\nreached the stars.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        HOW FASCISMO WAS CREATED\r\n                       ITS EVOLUTION AND ESSENCE\r\n\r\n  Speech delivered at the Teatro Comunale of Bologna, 3rd April 1921.\r\n\r\n  Bologna, the capital of the so-called red region of Emilia, a region\r\n  thought to be lost to the Italian State as far as laws and authority\r\n  were concerned, from the 2nd to the 4th of April passed through\r\n  truly memorable days.\r\n\r\n  The learned and noble city, with its fine patriotic traditions,\r\n  whose very walls recall the popular and patrician insurrection\r\n  against the Austrians, welcomed Benito Mussolini with manifestations\r\n  of solidarity and veneration such as were accorded to Giuseppe\r\n  Garibaldi. For if the latter was a liberator from foreign tyranny,\r\n  the former had been no less a liberator from an equal tyranny,\r\n  arising from similar causes, although materialised through different\r\n  means and by different agents living in our midst.\r\n\r\n  All who witnessed those enthusiastic manifestations instantly\r\n  perceived that the problem of Italian internal politics was now\r\n  solved by the definite defeat of that parasitic, anti-National\r\n  Socialism, the enemy of liberty, which had chosen the Valle Padana\r\n  as the most suitable experimental field for the fecundation of the\r\n  microbes of Collectivist Utopia, and incidentally for the\r\n  exploitation of the masses of the proletariat.\r\n\r\n\r\nFascisti of Emilia and Romagna—Citizens of Bologna! I feel that I might\r\nbe carried out of that sphere of eloquence which is mine by all the\r\ncircumstances of this meeting, beginning with the welcomes of yesterday\r\nevening and the songs of last night, and ending with this magnificent\r\nsea of heads and the greeting which I received with the greatest\r\nveneration from the widow of our unforgettable Giulio Giordani, and the\r\npresence of two heroic women, the widows of the two heroes, Battisti and\r\nVenezian. (Applause.) But as I hope, and am almost certain, that you do\r\nnot expect eloquence from me, but a short abrupt speech as is my habit,\r\nI will proceed to speak clearly in the Fascista manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n_How Fascismo was born._ I thank my friend Grandi for having presented\r\nme to you and with such flattering words. I do not think, however, that\r\nI am guilty of the sin of pride if I accept them. I think I may say, in\r\naccordance with Socrates, that I know myself. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nHow then was this Fascismo born; amid what conflicting passions,\r\nsympathy, hatred, and lack of comprehension? It was not only born in my\r\nmind and heart, in that meeting held in March 1919 in the little hall at\r\nMilan, it was born of the profound and perennial need of this our\r\nMediterranean and Aryan race, which felt the essential foundations of\r\nits existence threatened by a tragic folly which will crumble to pieces,\r\nto-day, upon the ground on which it was raised.\r\n\r\nWe felt then—we, who were not penitent Magdalens; we, who had always had\r\nthe courage to uphold intervention and reason in those days of 1915; we,\r\nwho were not ashamed of having barred the way to Austria on the Piave\r\nand having crushed her at Vittorio Veneto; we, who wished for a\r\nvictorious peace, felt at once, almost before the exultation of victory\r\nhad passed, that our task was not ended, and I, myself, felt that my\r\nwork was not done. As a matter of fact, at every turn of events it was\r\nsaid that my task and the task of the forces I lead was accomplished. In\r\nMay 1915, when the Fascismo of Revolutionary Action had swept away all\r\nneutralists from the streets and squares of Italy, even in the smallest\r\nvillages, it was said: “Mussolini has no more to say to the nation.” But\r\nwhen the tragic days of Caporetto came and Milan was grey and ghastly\r\nfor those who felt that if the Austrians passed and came to the city of\r\nthe Cinque Giornate it would be the end of Italy, then we felt that we\r\nstill had a word to say. And again, after victory, when there arose the\r\nmore or less democratic school of renunciation which was intent upon\r\nmutilating the victory, we Fascisti had the supreme and unprejudiced\r\ncourage to proclaim ourselves Imperialists and against all renunciation.\r\n\r\nThat was the first battle, fought in the theatre of the Scala in January\r\n1919. But how did it happen? We had won; we had sacrificed the flower of\r\nour youth, and they came to us with bills of usury and extortion! They\r\ndisputed with us the sacred boundaries of the country, and there were\r\nDemocrats in Italy, whose democracy consisted in Imperialism for others\r\nand no Imperialism for us, who threw this ridiculous accusation at us,\r\nbecause we intended that Italy should be bounded on the north by the\r\nBrenner, as she shall be while there is Italian blood in Italy! We\r\nintended that the eastern boundaries should be at the Nevoso, because\r\nthat is the just and natural confine of our country; and they accused us\r\nbecause we did not turn deaf ears to the appeal of Fiume, because we\r\nfeel in our hearts the sufferings of our brothers in Dalmatia, because,\r\nin fact, we feel those bonds of race to be alive and vital which bind\r\nus, not only to the Italians of Zara, Ragusa and Cattaro, but also to\r\nthose of the Canton Ticino and Corsica, to those beyond the oceans, to\r\nall that great family of fifty million men whom we wish to unite in the\r\nsame pride of race. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nAlready we have noticed the first signs of the Socialist offensive. On\r\n16th February, Milan was the witness—to the fear and terror of the\r\ntrembling middle classes—of a procession of 20,000 Bolshevists, who,\r\nafter having hymned Lenin from the top of the castle towers, proclaimed\r\nthat the Bolshevist revolution was imminent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Pride of Victory._ On the morrow of that day I issued an\r\narticle,[8] which made an impression also among some friends, and which\r\nwas entitled, “The Return of the Triumphant Beast.” In it was said: “We\r\nare ready to dig trenches in the squares of Italy and set up barbed\r\nwire, in order to win and fight to the last against the enemy.” And the\r\nsabotage, begun with that parade, lasted all the summer.\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  _Popolo d’Italia_, 17th Feb. 1919.\r\n\r\nAlso, in those days, we Fascisti had the courage to defend certain\r\nactions which, measured by the standard of current morals, perhaps were\r\nindefensible. But, gentlemen, war is like revolution, it must be taken\r\nas a whole; detail cannot and must not be gone into. But, meanwhile, the\r\ncampaign had its results upon the elections. One million eight hundred\r\nand fifty thousand electors registered their vote with the symbol of the\r\nsickle and the hammer. One hundred and fifty-six deputies were returned\r\nto the Chamber. The catastrophe seemed imminent. Then I was fished out,\r\na suicide(!) of the waters—not by any means too limpid—of the old\r\nNaviglio!\r\n\r\nBut one thing had been forgotten—our tenacious spirit and sometimes\r\nindomitable will. I, proud of my four thousand votes—and those who saw\r\nme in those days know how immovably I accepted that electoral\r\nresponse—said, “The battle goes on!” Because I firmly believed that the\r\nday would come in which the Italians would be ashamed of the elections\r\nof 16th November, that the day would come in which the Italians would no\r\nlonger elect in two cities that ignoble deserter whom I do not wish to\r\nname. And it has proved true, because this man to-day, not being able to\r\nmaintain his part in the drama, has descended from the stage and, having\r\ndespised the Guardie Regie, now asks them for protection.\r\n\r\nBut has the growth of this movement of Fascismo, this young ardent and\r\nheroic movement, finished yet? I, who vindicate the paternity of this,\r\nmy creature so overflowing with life, feel sometimes that it has already\r\noverstepped the modest boundaries I laid down for it. Now we Fascisti\r\nhave a clear programme; we must move on led by a pillar of fire, because\r\nwe are slandered and not understood. And, however much violence may be\r\ndeplored, it is evident that we, in order to make our ideas understood,\r\nmust beat refractory skulls with resounding blows.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Necessary Violence._ But we do not make a school, a system or, worse\r\nstill, an æsthetic of violence. We are violent when it is necessary to\r\nbe so. But I tell you at once that this necessary violence on the part\r\nof the Fascisti must have a character and style of its own, definitely\r\naristocratic, or, if you prefer, surgical.\r\n\r\nOur punitive expeditions, all those acts of violence which figure in the\r\npapers, must always have the character of a just retort and legitimate\r\nreprisal; because we are the first to recognise that it is sad, after\r\nhaving fought the external enemy, to have to fight the enemy within,\r\nwho, whether they like it or not, are Italians. But it is necessary, and\r\nas long as it is necessary, we shall continue to carry out this hard and\r\nthankless task.\r\n\r\nNow the Democrats, the Republicans and the Socialists accuse us of\r\nvarious things. The Socialists, hitherto, have said that we were sold to\r\nthe profiteers and the agrarians. Now there are not enough profiteers in\r\nthe whole of Italy to support a movement like ours, and in any case I\r\nmust say that they would be rather stupid profiteers, because from the\r\nMarch of 1919 we, in our Fascista programmes, have laid down fiscal\r\nprovisions which are pretty heavy and in any case anti-profiteer. The\r\naccusations of the Democrats are equally ridiculous, and also those of\r\nthe Republicans. I cannot explain to myself why the Republicans are\r\nagainst a movement which has republican tendencies like ours. I could\r\nunderstand them being against us if we were in favour of the monarchy.\r\nThey say to us: “You have no preconceptions.” We have not, and we are\r\nproud of it. But you must explain the phenomenon of the anger and the\r\nincomprehension of the Socialists. The Socialists had formed a State\r\nwithin a State. If this new State had been more liberal, more modern,\r\nnearer the old type, there would have been nothing against it. But this\r\nState, and you know it by direct experience, is more tyrannical,\r\nilliberal and overbearing than the old one; and for this reason that\r\nwhich we are causing to-day is a revolution to break up the Bolshevist\r\nState, while waiting to settle our accounts with the Liberal State which\r\nremains. (Applause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Socialist Crisis and the Fascista Attitude to the Elections._ There\r\nare those who think that the Socialist crisis is only a crisis limited\r\nto a few men; but it goes deeper, my dear friends, and it represents a\r\ngeneral upheaval.\r\n\r\nAmong other absurd things, there has been that of baptising Socialism as\r\nscientific. Now there is nothing scientific in the world. Science\r\nexplains the “how” of things, but does not explain the “why.” If, then,\r\nthere is nothing scientific in what are called the exact sciences, what\r\nis more absurd than to try and pass off as scientific a vast, uncertain,\r\nunderground and dark movement such as Socialism has been, even though it\r\nmay have had a useful function at first, when it directed the oppressed\r\npeoples towards new ways of life, because you will agree with me that\r\nthere is no turning back? Foolish reactionary and Conservative\r\ncontraband practices must not be carried on under the Fascista flag. To\r\nwrench from the masses the conquests, they have obtained through\r\nsacrifice would be impossible. We are the first to recognise that a\r\nState law should grant the eight-hour day, and that there should be a\r\nsocial legislation corresponding to the exigencies of the new times. And\r\nthis is not because we recognise the importance of the proletariat. We\r\nlook at the question from another point of view. We realise that there\r\ncannot be a great nation, capable of doing great things, if the working\r\nmasses are constrained to live under brutalising conditions. It is\r\nnecessary, then, that by preaching and practising the reconciliation of\r\nright and duty, which I call Mazzinian, this enormous mass of tens of\r\nmillions of people who work shall be raised to an ever higher level of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Brothers, not Enemies!_ It is absurd to depict us as the enemies of the\r\nworking classes. We feel ourselves to be brothers in spirit of all those\r\nwho work; but we do not make distinctions, we do not put work-worn hands\r\ninto the first rank. We do not place the new divinity, manual labour,\r\nupon the altar. For us all work—the astronomer who in his observatory\r\nconsults the trajectory of the stars, the lawyer, the archæologist, the\r\nstudent of religion and the artist, if they are increasing by their work\r\nthe sum total of spiritual wealth which is at the disposal of mankind.\r\nWe wish to see the realisation of a communion between spirit and matter,\r\nbetween the arm and the brain, the realisation of the solidarity of the\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nFascismo is then the blast of heresy which beats at the doors of all the\r\nchurches and says to the old and more or less tearful priest: “Get out\r\nof the way of these temples which threaten ruin to you, for our\r\ntriumphant heresy is destined to bring light to all brains and all\r\nsouls!” And we say to all men, great and small, upon the national\r\npolitical scene: “Make way for the youth of Italy which wishes to affirm\r\nits faith and passion. And if you do not make way spontaneously, you\r\nwill be overwhelmed in our universal punitive expedition, which is to\r\ncollect all the free spirits of Italy and bind them together in a\r\nFascio.” (Applause.)\r\n\r\nWe are now face to face with a fact, which is that of the elections. The\r\nChamber being old, and more than old, worn out, the protagonists of this\r\nsemi-tragedy being tired and misled, it is time to make that new appeal\r\nto the electors which is imperative. Do you not feel that, if the\r\nelections of 1919 had the character of sabotage, the elections of 1921\r\nwill be definitely Fascista? Do you not feel that the helm of State will\r\nnever return to the old men of the old Italy?\r\n\r\nI received a message to-day on the strength of which I feel I can state\r\nthat the difference, more or less artificially created, which existed\r\nbetween the defenders of Fiume—to whom we pay the homage of our\r\ngratitude—and us, her defenders at home, has no more _raison d’être_.\r\nAnd this difference, which, rather than by the legionaries, was created\r\nby certain politicians who were not even at Fiume when it was attacked\r\nseriously, will be put an end to by Gabriele d’Annunzio.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Day consecrated to Fascismo._ Another characteristic of Fascismo is\r\npride of nationality. And, in connection with this, I am pleased to tell\r\nyou that we have already decided the Fascista day. If the Socialists\r\nhave May Day, if the Popular Party have 15th May, and other parties\r\nother days, we Fascisti will have one, too, and it shall be the day of\r\nthe birth of Rome, 21st April. Upon that day, in token of the eternity\r\nof Rome, in memory of that city which gave two civilisations to the\r\nworld and will give a third, we Fascisti will gather together, and the\r\nregional legions will file past in the Fascista order, which is neither\r\nmilitary nor German, but simply Roman. We have abolished the procession\r\nand substituted this ancient form of manifestation, which imposes\r\nindividual control on each participator and order and discipline upon\r\nall. For we wish to introduce strict national discipline, without which\r\nItaly cannot become the Mediterranean and world nation of which we\r\ndream. And those who blame us for marching like the Germans must\r\nremember that it is not we who imitate the Germans, but they who imitate\r\nthe Romans, for which reason it is we who go back to the original, who\r\nreturn to the Roman style, the Latin and Mediterranean style.\r\n\r\nWe have no prejudices, because we are not a church, we are a movement.\r\nWe are not a party, we are a band of free men. If anyone is tired of\r\nbeing Fascista, there are twenty shops, twenty churches at whose doors\r\nto knock and ask for hospitality. We have not institutions either, we\r\nconsider them superfluous. Ours is an army characterised by enthusiasm\r\nand voluntary discipline, and known, above all, not in the light of\r\nguardian of some party or faction, but as guardian of the nation. We are\r\nknown for the love we bear to Italy, to her history and her\r\ncivilisation, as well as to her inhabitants and geographical\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nYesterday, while the train carried me to Bologna, I felt myself in\r\nharmony with all things and all men. I felt bound to this earth; I felt\r\nmyself an infinitesimal part of that great river which flows from the\r\nAlps to the Adriatic; I recognised my brothers in the peasants, those\r\npeasants with the grave attitudes of those who work the soil; I saw\r\nmyself in the blue sky, which awakened my inextinguishable passion for\r\nflight; I recognised myself in all the aspects of nature and man. And a\r\nprofound prayer arose in my heart. It is the prayer that every Italian\r\nshould make, when the sunrise illumines the sky and the twilight\r\ndescends over the earth. “We, Italians of the twentieth century, who\r\nhave witnessed the great tragedy which has brought about the fulfilment\r\nof our nationality; we, who carry in the depths of our souls the memory\r\nof the dead, who are our religion; we, citizens of Italy, shall make one\r\noath, one single resolution: that we only shall be the modest but\r\npersevering builders of her present and future fortunes.” (Applause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          THE ITALY WE WANT WITHIN, AND HER FOREIGN RELATIONS\r\n\r\n             This Speech was delivered 20th September 1922.\r\n\r\n  The four following speeches are undoubtedly the most important of\r\n  this collection, because they depict Mussolini as the polemic, the\r\n  agitator, the warrior, the leader, travelling to his political\r\n  maturity. In reading them one recognises the _condottiero_ who is\r\n  quite sure of himself, who is near the end of his march, and is\r\n  certain of reaching his final goal.\r\n\r\n  Except for a gradually accelerated rhythm, proportionate to the\r\n  precipitation of events, the tone of the four speeches is almost the\r\n  same. There is no pause, no perplexity, nothing which might induce\r\n  the reader to think of a change of direction, of a truce, of the\r\n  relinquishing of the struggle. But rather one notices the close\r\n  march of a compact and well-equipped army, determined to struggle on\r\n  and to win at whatever cost.\r\n\r\n  At UDINE, that strong old town, the sentinel of the country, dear to\r\n  the heart of all Italian soldiers, the leader of Fascismo initiates\r\n  the spiritual and physical mobilisation of the “black shirts,” while\r\n  he hurls the first challenge at the old political caste and lays\r\n  down the fundamental points of the imminent national revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe speech which I intend to make to-day is going to be an exception to\r\nthe rule which I have imposed upon myself of limiting my speeches, as\r\nfar as I can. Oh! if it were only possible to do as the poets advise and\r\nstrangle the verbose, inconclusive oratory which has side-tracked us for\r\nso long! I am certain, or at any rate I hope, that you do not expect\r\nanything from me in a speech which is not eminently Fascista, that is to\r\nsay straightforward, hard, bare facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Unity of the Country._ Do not expect a commemoration of the 20th\r\nSeptember. Certainly the subject would be tempting and there would be\r\nample material for reflection in re-examining by what prodigies of\r\nimmeasurable force, and through how many and how great sacrifices, Italy\r\nhas been able to achieve her not yet complete unity. I say not yet\r\ncomplete, because perfect unity cannot be spoken of until Fiume and\r\nDalmatia and the other territories have come back to us, thus fulfilling\r\nthe proud dream which we carry in our hearts. Instead, I ask you to\r\nconsider that throughout the Risorgimento—which began with the first\r\nattempt at rebellion on the part of a small section of a cavalry\r\nregiment at Nola, and ended with the breach of Porta Pia in ’70—two\r\nforces were brought into play: one, the traditional and conservative\r\nforce, of necessity rather stationary and sluggish, the force of the\r\nSavoy and Piedmont tradition; the other, the rebellious and\r\nrevolutionary force which sprang from the best elements among the\r\nbourgeoisie especially. And it was only as the result of the\r\nreconciliation and balancing of these two forces that we were able to\r\nrealise the unity of the Country. Perhaps something of the sort can be\r\nfound to-day, and of this I shall go on to speak later.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rome!_ Have you ever asked yourselves why the unity of the country is\r\nsummed up in the symbol and the name of Rome? We Fascisti must forget\r\nthe more or less ungrateful welcome we received at Rome in the October\r\nof last year, otherwise we should show ourselves to be mean-spirited,\r\nand we must have the courage to own that part of the responsibility for\r\nwhat happened belongs to us, on account of some elements among us which\r\nwere not on the high level the situation required.\r\n\r\nAnd Rome must not be confused with the Romans; with those hundreds of\r\nso-called “fugitives of Fascismo” which are to be found at Rome, Milan\r\nand other centres in Italy, who effectively arouse harmful anti-Fascista\r\nfeeling in the country. But if Mazzini and Garibaldi tried three times\r\nto arrive at Rome, and if Garibaldi gave his “red shirts” the tragic and\r\ninexorable alternative of “Rome or death,” this means that, to the best\r\nmen of the Risorgimento, Rome already had an essential function of the\r\nfirst importance to perform in the new history of the Italian nation.\r\n\r\nLet us then, with minds pure and free from animosity, lift up our\r\nthoughts towards Rome, which is one of the few spiritual cities which\r\nexist in the world; because at Rome, among those seven hills so pregnant\r\nwith history, occurred one of the greatest spiritual miracles which have\r\never taken place—that is, the transformation of an Eastern religion, not\r\nunderstood by us, into a universal one, and which has succeeded, under\r\nanother form, to the Empire that the Roman legions had carried to the\r\nextreme ends of the earth. And we want to make Rome the city of our\r\nideals, a city cleaned and purified of all those elements which corrupt\r\nand defile her; we wish to make Rome the throbbing heart, the living\r\nspirit of the Italy of which we dream.\r\n\r\nSomebody might object, saying: “Are you worthy of Rome? Are you capable\r\nof inheriting and transmitting the ideals and glories of an Empire?” And\r\nthen surly critics busy themselves with trying to find signs of\r\nuncertainty in our young, exuberant organisation!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fascista Discipline._ People speak to us of Fascista _autonomy_. I tell\r\nthe Fascisti and citizens that this autonomy has no importance\r\nwhatsoever. It is not an autonomy of ideas and prejudice. Fascismo has\r\nno prejudices; they are the sad privilege of the old parties,\r\nassociations scattered over all countries, whose members, having nothing\r\nbetter to do or to say, end by imitating those sordid priests of the\r\nEast who discussed all the questions of the world while the Byzantine\r\nEmpire perished. The few and sporadic attempts on the part of Fascisti\r\nto establish autonomy are either frustrated or nearly so, because they\r\nrepresent only revenge of a personal nature.\r\n\r\nWe come to another question: _discipline_. I am in favour of the most\r\nrigid discipline. We must first sternly discipline ourselves, otherwise\r\nwe shall not have the right to discipline the nation. And it is only by\r\nthe discipline of the nation that Italy can make herself heard in the\r\ncouncils of the other countries. Discipline must be accepted. If it is\r\nnot, it must be imposed. We put aside the democratic dogma that one must\r\nfor ever proceed by sermonising and lecturing in a more or less liberal\r\nmanner. At a given moment discipline must show itself under the form of\r\na command or of an act of force.\r\n\r\nI exact discipline, and I do not speak to the men of the Friulian\r\ndistrict, who are—let me say—perfect as regards sobriety and\r\ncorrectness, austerity and quiet living, but I speak to the Fascisti of\r\nall Italy, who, if they must have a dogma, must have one which bears the\r\nclear name of discipline. Only by obedience, by the humble and sacred\r\npride in obedience, can the right to command be conquered. And only when\r\nit is conquered can it be imposed upon others; otherwise, no! The\r\nFascisti of Italy must take note of this. They must not interpret\r\ndiscipline as a call to order of the administrative kind or as the fear\r\nof shepherds who foresee the scattering of their flock. This cannot be,\r\nbecause we are not shepherds and our forces cannot be called, by any\r\nmeans, a flock. We are an army, and it is just because we have this\r\nspecial organisation that we must make discipline the supreme pivot of\r\nour life and action.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Violence!_ I come now to the question of violence. Violence is not\r\nimmoral. On the contrary it is sometimes moral. We dispute the right of\r\nour enemies to bewail our violence, because, compared with that which\r\nwas committed in the unlucky years of ’19 and ’20 and with that of the\r\nBolshevists in Russia—where two million people have been executed and\r\nanother two million still pine in prison—our violence is child’s-play.\r\nOn the other hand violence is decisive, because at the end of July and\r\nAugust, after having made use of it systematically for forty-eight\r\nhours, we got results which we should not have obtained in forty-eight\r\nyears of sermons and propaganda. When, therefore, violence removes a\r\ngangrene of this sort, it is morally sacred and necessary.\r\n\r\nBut, my Fascista friends, and I speak to the Fascisti of all Italy, our\r\nviolence must have certain Fascista characteristics. The violence of ten\r\nto one is to be disowned and condemned. There is a violence that frees\r\nand a violence that binds; there is moral violence and stupid, immoral\r\nviolence. Violence must be proportionate to the necessities of the\r\nmoment, and not made a school, a doctrine or a sport. The Fascisti must\r\nbe careful not to spoil with sporadic, individual and unjustifiable acts\r\nof violence, the brilliant and splendid victories of August.\r\n\r\nThis is what our enemies are waiting for. As the result of certain\r\nepisodes—let us frankly admit disagreeable episodes—such as that at\r\nTaranto, they have been led to believe and to hope that violence has\r\nbecome a sort of second habit, and that when we no longer have a target\r\nupon which to practise, we shall turn against ourselves and against each\r\nother, or the Nationalists. Now the Nationalists differ from us on\r\ncertain questions, but the truth is this, that in all the battles we\r\nhave fought we have had them by our side. It may well be that among them\r\nthere are leaders who do not see Fascismo as we see it, but it must be\r\nrecognised and proclaimed that the “blue shirts”[9] at Genoa, Bologna\r\nand Milan, and in another hundred centres, were with the “black shirts.”\r\nIn consequence the occurrence at Taranto was most displeasing, and I\r\nhope that the leaders of Fascismo will act in such a way that it remains\r\nan isolated incident to be forgotten in a local reconciliation and in a\r\nnational manifestation of sympathy and solidarity.\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n  The Nationalists.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Our Syndicalism._ Another argument which raises the hopes of our\r\nenemies is the existence of the masses. You know that I do not worship\r\nthe new divinity, the masses. It is a creation of Democracy and\r\nSocialism. Just because they are numerous, they must be right. Not a bit\r\nof it, the opposite has often proved to be true that the masses are\r\nagainst the right. In any case history proves that it has always been\r\nthe minorities, a handful from the first, that have produced profound\r\nchanges in human society. We do not adore the masses, even if they have\r\ngot work-worn hands and brains. We shall bring, instead, into our\r\nexamination of social life, ideas and elements new at any rate in\r\nItalian circles. We could not turn away the masses; they came to us.\r\nOught we to have received them with kicks on the shins? Are they\r\nsincere? Do they come to us as the result of conviction or fear, or\r\nbecause they hope to get from us what they failed to obtain from the\r\nSocialists? These questions are really superfluous, as no one yet has\r\nfound the way to penetrate into their inmost minds.\r\n\r\nWe have, therefore, had to adopt syndicalism, and we are doing so. They\r\nsay: “Your syndicalism will end by being in every way exactly like that\r\nof the Socialists, and you will have, of necessity, to promote class\r\nwar.” The democracy, or a section of them, that section which does not\r\nseem to have any better object than stirring up the mud, continue from\r\nRome (where they print too many papers, many of which do not represent\r\nanybody or anything) to work in this direction. But our syndicalism\r\ndiffers from that of the others, because we do not allow strikes in\r\npublic services under any pretext, and we are in favour of co-operation\r\namong the classes, especially in a period like the present one of acute\r\neconomic crisis. We try to make this conception penetrate the brains of\r\nour syndicates. But it must be made equally clear that the industrial\r\nworkers and their employers must not blackmail us, because there is a\r\nlimit which must not be passed; and these workers and their masters—the\r\nbourgeoisie in a word—must take into account that the nation also\r\nconsists of the people, a mass which labours, and one cannot think of\r\nthe greatness of the nation if this portion is restless and idle. The\r\ntask of Fascismo is to make the people organically one with the nation,\r\nso that they may be ready to-morrow when the nation has need of them, as\r\nthe artist takes his raw material in order to create his masterpiece.\r\nOnly with the masses forming an intimate part of the life and history of\r\nthe nation can we have a foreign policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Foreign Policy._ And now I come to the subject which, at the present\r\nmoment, is of the greatest positive importance. It is evident that at\r\nthe end of the war it was not understood how to make peace. There were\r\ntwo alternatives: the peace of the sword, and the peace of approximate\r\njustice. But, under the influence of a pernicious democratic mentality,\r\nthe peace of the sword was not made by occupying Berlin, Vienna and\r\nBudapest, and neither has the approximate peace of justice been\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nMen, many of whom were ignorant of history and geography (and it seems\r\nthat these famous experts who thus disarrange and rearrange the map of\r\nEurope at their will really know as little about it as their masters),\r\nhave said: “The moment the Turks give trouble to the English, we will\r\nsuppress Turkey; but the moment that Italy, in order to become a\r\nMediterranean power, ought to have the Adriatic as her inland gulf, we\r\ndeny Italy her Adriatic rights.” What is the result? The result is that\r\nthis kind of treaty naturally falls to pieces before the others. But,\r\nsince everything depends upon the making up of these treaties, since\r\nthey are all connected with each other, so the failure of the Treaty of\r\nSèvres may possibly involve the failure of all the others. Moreover, if\r\nthe position becomes more involved, you will see the indestructible\r\nRussian Cossack, who changes his name but not his nature, coming forward\r\nagain. Who armed the Turkey of Kemal Pasha? France and Russia. Who may\r\npossibly arm Germany to-morrow? Russia. Considering what we aim at in\r\nour foreign policy, it is very fortunate that besides our national army,\r\nof glorious tradition, there is the Fascista army.\r\n\r\nOur Ministers for foreign affairs ought to know how to play this card\r\ntoo, with the warning: “Be careful; Italy no longer follows a policy of\r\nrenunciation and cowardice, cost what it may!” So it has come about that\r\nwhile in other countries men are beginning to realise the force\r\nrepresented by Italian Fascismo, in the field of foreign policy our\r\nMinisters still remain in a yielding attitude. We are asked what is our\r\nprogramme. I have already answered this question, which was meant to be\r\ninsidious, at a little meeting held at Levanto in the presence of thirty\r\nor forty Fascisti, and I did not think that a little homely speech would\r\nhave such a vast echo.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Our Programme. The Crisis of the Liberal State._ Our programme is\r\nsimple: we wish to govern Italy. They ask us for programmes, but there\r\nare already too many. It is not programmes that are wanting for the\r\nsalvation of Italy, but men and will-power.\r\n\r\nThere is not an Italian who does not think that he possesses the one\r\nsure method by which the most acute problems of our national life may be\r\nsolved. But I think you are all convinced that our political class is\r\ndeficient. The crisis of the Liberal State has proved it. We have made a\r\nsplendid war from the point of view of collective and individual acts of\r\nheroism. From having been soldiers, the Italians, in 1918, became\r\nwarriors. I beg you to note the essential difference. But our political\r\nclass carried on the war as if it had been work of ordinary\r\nadministration. These men whom we all know, and whose very features are\r\nfamiliar to every one of us, now appear men of the past, ruined, tired\r\nand beaten.\r\n\r\nI do not deny, in my absolute objectivity, that this middle class, which\r\nmight, with a world-wide title, be called Giolittian, has its merits. It\r\ncertainly has. But to-day, when Italy is still under the influence of\r\nVittorio Veneto—to-day, when Italy is bursting with life, vigour and\r\npassion, these men, who are above all accustomed to Parliamentary\r\nmystification, do not appear to us to be big enough for the situation.\r\nIt is necessary, therefore, to consider how to replace this political\r\nclass which has of late consistently surrendered to that swollen-headed\r\npuppet, Italian Socialism.\r\n\r\nI think that this replacement has become necessary, and that the more\r\ncomplete it is the better. Certainly Fascismo, in taking the entire\r\nforty-seven millions of Italians under its care, will assume a great\r\nresponsibility. It is to be foreseen that many will be disappointed,\r\nbecause, in any case, there is always disappointment sooner or later,\r\nwhether things are accomplished or not.\r\n\r\nFriends! Like the life of the individual, the life of the nation brings\r\nwith it a certain amount of risk. One cannot hope to run for ever on the\r\nDecauville track of daily regularity. At a given moment both men and\r\nparties must have the courage to shoulder heavy responsibility and to\r\nadopt a daring policy. They may succeed; they may fail. But there are\r\nalso unsuccessful attempts that suffice to ennoble and uplift for all\r\ntime the soul of a movement such as Italian Fascismo.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Question of Régime. The Monarchy and Fascismo._ I had intended to\r\nrepeat this speech at Naples, but I think that I shall have other things\r\nto deal with there. Do not let us delay, therefore, about entering on\r\nthe delicate subject of régime.\r\n\r\nMany of the controversies which were raised by the question of the\r\nnature of my tendencies are forgotten, and everybody is convinced that\r\nthey were not formed suddenly, but represented a settled idea. It is\r\nalways like that. Certain attitudes appear improvised to the general\r\npublic, which is neither fitted nor obliged to follow the slow changes\r\nwhich take place in a restless spirit desirous of making a profound\r\nexamination of certain problems. But there is inward pain and toil,\r\nwhich is sometimes tragic. You must not think that the heads of Fascismo\r\ndo not know what this individual, and above all national, travail is.\r\n\r\nThe much-talked-of republican tendency had to be a kind of attempt at\r\nseparation from the many elements which had come to us simply because we\r\nhad won. These elements do not please us. These people who always side\r\nwith the victor, and who are ready to change their flag with a change of\r\nfortune, must be looked upon with suspicion and carefully watched by the\r\nFascisti. Is it possible—here is the question—to bring about a profound\r\ntransformation in our political régime and to create a new Italy without\r\ntouching the monarchic system? What is the general attitude of the\r\nFascisti as regards political institutions? Our attitude does not commit\r\nus in any sense. In truth, perfect régimes are only to be found in books\r\nof philosophy. I think that it would have been disastrous for the Greek\r\ncity if the theories of Plato had been literally applied. A people\r\ncontent under a republic never dreams of having a king. A people not\r\naccustomed to a republic longs to return to a monarchy.\r\n\r\nIt was in vain that the Germans tried to make the Phrygian cap fit their\r\nsquare heads. The Germans hate a republic, and the fact that it was\r\nimposed by the Entente and that it has been a kind of _ersatz_, is\r\nanother reason for their hating it. So that, generally speaking,\r\npolitical forms cannot be approved of or condemned for ever, but must be\r\nexamined from the point of view of their direct relation with the\r\nmentality, the economic condition and the spiritual force of any\r\nparticular people. (A voice cries: “Long live Mazzini!”)\r\n\r\nNow, I think that the régime can be largely modified without interfering\r\nwith the monarchy. In reality—and I refer to the cry of my friend—the\r\nsame Mazzini, republican and advocate of republicanism, did not consider\r\nhis doctrines incompatible with the monarchic aspect of Italian unity.\r\nHe resigned himself to it and accepted it. It was not his ideal, but the\r\nideal cannot always be realised.\r\n\r\nWe shall, then, leave the monarchic institution outside our field of\r\naction, which will have other great objects, because we think that a\r\ngreat part of Italy would regard with suspicion a change in the régime\r\nwhich was carried thus far. We should have regional separatism, perhaps,\r\nbecause it is always so. To-day there are many indifferent to the\r\nmonarchy who to-morrow would be its supporters, and who would find\r\nhighly respectable and sentimental reasons for attacking Fascismo, if it\r\nhad dared to aim at this target.\r\n\r\nI do not think that the monarchy has really any object in opposing what\r\nmust now be called the Fascista revolution. It is not in its interests,\r\nbecause by doing so it would immediately make itself an object of\r\nattack, in which case we could not spare it, because it would be a\r\nquestion of life or death for us.\r\n\r\nThose who sympathise with us must not withdraw into the shade; they must\r\nstay in the light. They must have the courage to remain monarchists. The\r\nmonarchy would represent the historical continuity of the nation; a\r\nsplendid task and one of incalculable importance.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Fascista revolution must also avoid risking\r\neverything. Some firm ground must be left, so that the people shall not\r\nfeel that everything is falling to pieces, that everything must be begun\r\nagain, because in that case the first wave of enthusiasm would be\r\nfollowed by a wave of panic. Now everything is very plain. The\r\nsocial-democratic superstructure must be destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The State we want._ We must have a State which will simply say: “The\r\nState does not represent a party, it represents the nation as a whole,\r\nit includes all, is over all, protects all, and fights any attempt made\r\nagainst her inviolable sovereignty.”\r\n\r\nThis is the State which must arise from the Italy of Vittorio Veneto. A\r\nState which does not acknowledge that the strongest power is right;\r\nwhich is not like the Liberal State, which, after fifty years of life,\r\nwas unable to install a temporary printing press so as to issue its\r\npaper when there was a general strike of printers; a State which does\r\nnot fall under the power of the Socialists; which does not think that\r\nproblems can be settled only from the political point of view, as\r\nmachine-guns do not suffice if there is not the spirit behind to keep\r\nthem going. The whole armoury of the State falls to pieces like the old\r\nscenery in an operatic theatre when it is not inspired by the most\r\ndeep-rooted sense of the necessity of the fulfilment of duty—nay, of a\r\nmission.\r\n\r\nThat is why we want to remove from the State all its economic\r\nattributes. We have had enough of the State railwayman, the State\r\npostman and the State insurance official. We have had enough of the\r\nState administration at the expense of Italian tax-payers, which has\r\ndone nothing but aggravate the exhausted financial condition of the\r\ncountry. It still controls the police, who protect honest men from the\r\nattacks of thieves, the masters responsible for the education of the\r\nrising generations, the army which must guarantee the inviolability of\r\nthe country and our foreign policy.\r\n\r\nIt must not be said that the State thus shorn will remain very small.\r\nNo! It will remain very great, because it will still have all the\r\nspiritual dominion, having given up only material power.\r\n\r\nCitizens, I have placed my ideas before you as a whole, it is enough, to\r\nmy mind, for you to individualise them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To Friends and Enemies._ If this mentality of ours was not sufficient,\r\nthere are our methods, there is our daily activity, which we do not mean\r\nto give up, though watching at the same time that it is not carried to\r\nextremes, that it does not over-reach itself and so harm Fascismo. But\r\nwhen I say these words, I say them with intention, because if Fascismo\r\nwas a movement like all the rest, the attitude of the individual or of\r\nthe group would have a relative importance. But blood has been shed for\r\nour movement, and this must be remembered when there are attempts at\r\nautonomy and lack of discipline. The recent dead must be thought of\r\nbefore all things. It must be remembered that such autonomy and lack of\r\ndiscipline serve to arouse the miserable instincts of the Socialists,\r\nwho, though subdued, still secretly hatch plots for revenge, a revenge\r\nwhich we shall prevent by collective action and the avoidance of\r\nbloodshed.\r\n\r\nAfter all, the Romans were really right; if you want peace you must show\r\nyourself prepared for war. Those who are not prepared for war do not\r\nhave peace, and are defeated into the bargain. So we say to all our\r\nenemies: “It is not enough for you to go planting the tricolour all over\r\nthe place. We wish to see you put to the proof. You will have for a\r\nlittle while to undergo a sort of spiritual and political quarantine.\r\nYour leaders, who might again infect us, must be sent where they can do\r\nno harm.” Only by thus avoiding the lure of the mistaken idea of\r\nquantity shall we succeed in saving the quality and the spirit of our\r\nmovement, which is no ephemeral one, since it has already lasted four\r\nyears, equal in this tempestuous century to forty. Our movement is still\r\nin its prehistoric period and in process of formation; its real history\r\nbegins to-morrow. All that Fascismo has accomplished thus far has been\r\nnegative. Now it must begin to reconstruct. In this way its force, its\r\nspirit and its nobility will appear.\r\n\r\nFriends, I am sure that the Fascisti officers will do their duty. I am\r\nsure, too, that the men will do theirs. Before proceeding to the great\r\ntask we must make an inexorable selection from the rank and file. We\r\ncannot carry useless impedimenta; we are an army of _velites_, with a\r\nrearguard of solid territorials. We do not wish to have untrustworthy\r\nelements amongst us.\r\n\r\nI salute Udine, this dear old Udine to which I am bound by so many\r\nmemories. Many generations of Italians who were the flower of our race\r\nhave passed by its broad ways. Many of its young men now sleep their\r\nlast sleep in the little isolated cemeteries of the Alps or beside the\r\nIsonzo, now once again the sacred river of Italy.\r\n\r\nMen of Udine! Fascisti! Italians! Take upon yourselves the spirit of\r\nthese our unforgettable dead and make of it the burning emblem of our\r\nimmortal country! (Loud applause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    “THE PIAVE AND VITTORIO VENETO MARK THE BEGINNING OF NEW ITALY”\r\n\r\n           Speech delivered at Cremona, 25th September 1922.\r\n\r\n  Before forty thousand _contadini_ set free from the Social-Clerical\r\n  yoke, who march past in military order in closely-following\r\n  battalions, the leader’s eloquence is roused and elated, so that one\r\n  seems to hear the very sound of joy bells ringing in his speech.\r\n\r\n\r\nFascisti and working men of Cremona and the provinces! As so often\r\nhappens, reality has surpassed the most brilliant expectations. Your\r\nmeeting, Fascisti of Cremona, is the most impressive that I have yet\r\nattended. I have come among you to tell you how completely I am with\r\nyou, from your fine leader Roberto Farinacci to the last man in your\r\nranks. (Prolonged applause.)\r\n\r\nHere in times long past great ideas were conceived. This was the\r\nbirthplace of Democracy, which had a period of glory before it became\r\ncrippled and enfeebled by the influence of Socialism. And in spite of\r\nthe profound differences of opinion which divided us after the war, I\r\nmust call to remembrance another noble figure of your fruitful land—I\r\nspeak of Leonida Bissolati. (Frantic applause.)\r\n\r\nThose who, as the result of being led into false ideas by incorrect\r\ninformation, talk about agrarian slavery, ought to come here and see\r\nwith their own eyes this crowd of genuine workers, people with shoulders\r\nbroad enough and arms strong enough to bear the weight of the increasing\r\nfortunes of the nation. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nOnly the rabble could accuse us of being the enemies of the people, for\r\nwe are the sons of the people; we have known what manual labour is; we\r\nhave always lived among the working classes, who are infinitely superior\r\nto the false prophets who pretend to represent them. (Unanimous and\r\nprolonged applause.) But just because we are the sons of the people, we\r\ndo not wish to deceive them, we do not wish to mystify them or promise\r\nthem the unattainable, although we solemnly and formally pledge\r\nourselves to protect them and to vindicate their just rights and their\r\nlegitimate interests.\r\n\r\nAs I watched your procession passing—disciplined, ardent and exulting—as\r\nI watched the little Balillas, who represent the still immature spring\r\nof life, followed by the squadrons in the full flush of youth, and\r\nfinally the men in the vigour of manhood and even old men, I said to\r\nmyself that the series was complete since all phases of life, from the\r\nfirst to the last, were represented.\r\n\r\nFascisti! Great tasks await us. That which we have accomplished is\r\nnothing compared to that which awaits us. There is already a strong and\r\nmanifest contrast between the Italy of the cowardly politicians and the\r\nvigorous healthy Italy which is preparing to give the death-blow to all\r\ninefficiency and egoism and to clear away the infected strata of the\r\nItalian community. (Loud applause, and cries of “Rome! Rome!”)\r\n\r\nOur adversaries must not delude themselves. They thought in the\r\nunfortunate year of 1919, when we here in Cremona and all over Italy\r\nwere no more than a handful of men, that Fascismo would only be a\r\npassing phenomenon. Fascismo has now been alive four years, and it has\r\ntasks enough to fill a century. Nor must our enemies deceive themselves\r\nby thinking that they can break up our organisation, because we intend\r\nto make it more compact, more solid, better equipped against all\r\nemergencies; since, my friends, if a decisive blow is necessary, every\r\nman from the first to the last will do his exact duty. In a word, we\r\nwant Italy to become Fascista. (Clamorous applause.)\r\n\r\nThat is simple and clear. We want Italy to become Fascista, because we\r\nare tired of seeing her governed by men whose principles are continually\r\nwavering between indifference and cowardice. And, above all, we are\r\ntired of seeing her looked upon abroad as a negligible quantity.\r\n\r\nWhat is that feeling which stirs you when you hear the song of the\r\nPiave? It is that the Piave does not mark an end, it marks a beginning.\r\n(Hear, hear!) It is from the Piave, it is from Vittorio Veneto, it is\r\nfrom our victory—even if it was mutilated by a mistaken diplomacy—that\r\nour standards move on!\r\n\r\nIt was on the banks of the Piave that the march was begun that cannot\r\nstop until Rome is reached. (Enthusiastic applause.) And there are no\r\nobstacles, either of men or things, that can prevent us from arriving\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nI wish to thank you, Fascisti of Cremona and people of this city, for\r\nyour reception. I know and like to think that it is not to me personally\r\nthat you pay this honour, but to the ideal, our cause, which has been\r\nsanctified by so much blood shed by the flower of Italian youth. And\r\nembracing my old friend Farinacci I mean to embrace all the Fascisti of\r\nCremona, to the cry of Long live Italy! Long live Fascismo!\r\n(Enthusiastic applause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE FASCISTA DAWNING OF NEW ITALY\r\n\r\n     Speech delivered at Milan at the “Sciesa” on 6th October 1922.\r\n\r\n  At the seat of the local Fascista group “Antonio Sciesa,” Mussolini\r\n  pays his tribute to the memory of her two dead who fell, as\r\n  Garibaldi fell, during the days of August, and then devotes himself\r\n  to the analysis of a well-matured plan, strategic and tactical, for\r\n  the coming battle.\r\n\r\n\r\nI agreed to come and speak to the “Sciesa” group this evening for three\r\nreasons—first sentimental, second personal, and third political. For the\r\nsentimental reason, because I wished to pay the tribute of my admiration\r\nand profound devotion to our unforgettable and magnificent\r\nfallen—Melloni, Tonoli and Crespi; the first two of your squad and the\r\nlast of the “Sauro.” I remember them perfectly. Then I agreed also\r\nbecause of the way in which this group has interpreted this meeting.\r\nLastly, in view of the general attitude of suspense all over Italy at\r\nthis moment, I did not wish to let the opportunity slip for defining\r\ncertain points, a definition which is necessary in these difficult times\r\nthrough which we are passing.\r\n\r\nYou feel, to judge from your silent and austere bearing, that if the\r\nflesh is corruptible, the spirit is immortal. You feel that here in this\r\nlittle hall this evening the spirits of our fallen are still with us. We\r\nfeel their presence, because the soul cannot die, and they fell in the\r\nmost heroic action yet accomplished by Fascismo in the four years of its\r\nhistory. Many times when the Fascisti have gone forth to destroy with\r\nfire and sword the haunts of the cowardly Social-Communist delinquents,\r\nthey have only seen the backs of the flying enemy, but the members of\r\nthe “Sciesa” squad and the two fallen, whom we remember, and all the\r\nsquadrons of the Milanese Fascio, went to the assault of the offices of\r\nthe _Avanti_ as they would have attacked an Austrian trench. They had to\r\nscale the walls, break through barbed wire, burst open doors and face\r\nthe leaden hail which the enemy poured forth from their weapons. This is\r\nheroism. This is violence. This is the violence of which I approve and\r\nwhich I uphold, and which Fascismo—and I speak to the Fascisti of all\r\nItaly—ought to make hers. Not little, individual, sporadic acts of\r\nviolence, but the great, wonderful, relentless violence of the decisive\r\nhour. It is necessary, when the moment comes, to strike with the utmost\r\ndecision and without pity. You must not think that I wish to hide the\r\nvery strong sympathy I have for the Milanese Fascio, because my love,\r\nabove all, is for the cause. When a cause has been sanctified by so much\r\npure young blood, it must not, at any cost, become defiled in any way.\r\nOur friends have been heroes, their action has been that of warriors,\r\ntheir violence saintly and moral. We exalt them, we remember them, and\r\nwe will avenge them. We cannot accept the humanitarian, Tolstoyan moral\r\nstandard, the moral standard of slavery. In times of war we adopt the\r\nformula of Socrates: “Overcome friends with kindness, overcome enemies\r\nwith evil.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nation and State._ Our line of conduct is perfectly correct. Those who\r\ndo good to us will have good; those who do ill, ill. Our enemies cannot\r\ncomplain, if being such, they are treated hardly, as enemies must be\r\ntreated. We are in an historical period of crisis which every day\r\nbecomes more acute. The general strike, which was averted by the\r\nsacrifice of blood of the Fascisti, was an episode in this crisis.\r\nDissension lies between the State and the nation. Italy is not a State,\r\nshe is a nation, because from the Alps to Sicily there is the\r\nfundamental unity of our race, our customs, our language and our\r\nreligion. The war fought from 1915 to 1918 consecrates this unity, and\r\nif this is enough to characterise the nation, the Italian nation exists,\r\nfull of power and resource and impelled towards a glorious destiny.\r\n\r\nBut the nation must create for itself the State. And there is no State.\r\nTo-day the paper which represents Liberalism in Italy, the paper with\r\nthe largest circulation—and which, for this reason, by upholding absurd\r\narguments has done a great deal of harm at times—stated that there are\r\ntwo Governments in Italy, and if there are two, there is one too many.\r\nThere is the Liberal Government and the Fascista Government; the State\r\nof to-day and the State of to-morrow. “Wanted, a Government,” said the\r\n_Corriere della Sera_. We agree, a Government _is_ wanted.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Lesson of Two Episodes._ Two occurrences during these last days—one\r\ncharacteristic of our activity in the cause of humanity, the other of\r\nour activity in the cause of national rights—have proved the superiority\r\nof the Fascista over the Liberal State, and have shown that Fascismo is\r\ncapable and worthy to succeed that State.\r\n\r\nAt San Terenzo of Spezia, if all the dead were buried and the wounded\r\ntaken to the hospital, if the country was cleared of débris, and the\r\nfurniture and belongings safeguarded from the base attempts of human\r\njackals, if the soldiers had their supplies in good time, it was by the\r\nactivity of the Fascista State. And the mayor of Lerici—who is not a\r\nFascista—telegraphed his great gratitude, not to the Prime Minister, but\r\nto us, as you learnt in the _Popolo d’Italia_.\r\n\r\nThis is a question of mercy, humanity and national solidarity. Let us\r\ntransfer our attention to Bolzano. Here it is a question of our rights\r\nand the Italian law. Who stood up for those rights and imposed the\r\nItalian nationality in a city which ought to be Italian? Fascismo. Who\r\nbanished Perathoner who for five years held in check five Italian\r\nMinisters? Fascismo. It has been Fascismo that has given a school and a\r\nchurch to the Italians in the Upper Adige and inspired them with the\r\nsense of their own dignity. Who placed the bust of the king in the\r\nCouncil Hall? The Fascisti. The Germans are astonished at seeing before\r\nthem all these young Fascisti, splendid physically and morally.\r\nInhabiting as they do without right our Italian soil, they seem to\r\nwonder: “What Italy is this?” And we answer: “By the action of the\r\ndefeatist ministers and as a result of the unfortunate peace, you\r\nGermans are accustomed to the Italy of Abba Garima; now you must\r\naccustom yourselves to the Italy of Vittorio Veneto, which has force and\r\nenergy, and which says: ‘We are at the Brenner, and there we mean to\r\nstay! We do not wish to go to Innsbruck, but do not imagine that Germany\r\nand Austria can ever return to Bolzano!’”\r\n\r\nThis is the Fascista State which reveals itself to Italian eyes in two\r\ntypical moments of everyday history, the disaster of San Terenzo and the\r\noccupation of Bolzano.\r\n\r\n\r\n_For the Italy of To-morrow._ The citizens wonder which State will end\r\nby dictating its law upon the nation. We have no hesitation in answering\r\nthat it will be the Fascista State. The _Corriere della Sera_ says that\r\nsomething must be done quickly, and we agree. A nation cannot live\r\nnursing in its bosom two States, two Governments, one in action and the\r\nother in power. But what is the way to give the nation a Government? I\r\nsay Government, because when we say State we mean something more. We\r\nmean the spirit and not merely the inert and transitory form. There are\r\ntwo ways, gentlemen. If the whole of Rome was not suffering from\r\nsoftening of the brain, they would summon Parliament at the beginning of\r\nNovember, and having passed the Bill for Electoral Reform, make an\r\nappeal to the electors in December. Because the crisis for which the\r\n_Corriere_ asks could not alter the situation. Thirty crises in the\r\nItalian Parliament as it is to-day would mean thirty reincarnations of\r\nSignor Facta. If the Government does not follow this path, gentlemen, we\r\nshall be obliged to take the other. You see our tactics are now clear.\r\nWhen it is a question of assaulting the State it is no longer possible\r\nto have recourse to little plots, of which the “to be or not to be”\r\nremains a secret to the last. We must give orders to hundreds and\r\nthousands of men, and it would be merely absurd to try to keep it\r\nsecret. We play an open game. We leave our cards on the table until it\r\nis necessary to lift them; and we say: “There is an Italy which you\r\nLiberal leaders no longer understand. You do not understand it because\r\nyour mind works on old-fashioned lines, you do not understand it because\r\nParliamentary policy has killed your spirit. The Italy which has come\r\nfrom the trenches is strong, and full of life.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fascismo, the Bourgeoisie and the Proletariat._ It is an Italy which\r\ndeserves to begin a new period of history. There exists, therefore, a\r\ndramatic contrast between the Italy of yesterday and our Italy. The\r\nconflict appears inevitable. It is a question now of developing our\r\nforces, summoning all our energies and strength, so that the conflict\r\nshall end in victory for us—and, as a matter of fact, upon that score\r\nthere can be no doubt.\r\n\r\nNow the Liberal State is a mask behind which there is no face, it is a\r\nscaffolding behind which there is no building. There is force but there\r\nis no spirit behind them. All those who ought to uphold it feel that it\r\nis approaching the extreme limits of incompetence, impotence and\r\nabsurdity.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, as I said at Udine, we do not wish to stake\r\neverything on the game, because we do not present ourselves as the\r\nsaviours of humanity, nor do we promise anything special to the people.\r\nWe may even impose greater discipline and more sacrifices upon them. And\r\nwe shall make no difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie,\r\nbecause there is an infected proletariat just as there is a bourgeoisie\r\nstill more infected. There is a part of the proletariat that must be\r\nchastised in order that it may be redeemed afterwards, and there is a\r\npart of the middle class which detests us and tries to throw our lines\r\ninto confusion, which finances anti-Fascista slander, which has hitherto\r\nignobly courted the anti-national forces, and for which I do not feel\r\none ounce of pity. We are surrounded by enemies, and those who are our\r\nopen foes, and who belong to the Bolshevist parties, have now perfected\r\nthemselves in the art of ambush and assassination.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Warning!_ But there are other insidious enemies who try to harm\r\nFascismo under cover of the tricolour and other similar emblems, who try\r\nto insinuate themselves into our movement and to create simulacra of\r\norganisations in order to weaken us just at the time when it is most\r\nnecessary for us to remain united. Now I must say that if we do not have\r\nmercy upon those who attack us from behind hedges, neither shall we have\r\nmercy upon those who attack us thus insidiously. When the clock of\r\nhistory strikes the hours, we must speak as the peasants do, simply,\r\nsincerely and loyally.\r\n\r\nWe have no great obstacles to overcome, as the nation is waiting for us,\r\nthe nation hopes in us and feels itself represented in us. Certainly we\r\ncannot promise to plant the tree of liberty in the squares. We cannot\r\ngive liberty to those who would profit by it to assassinate us. The\r\nshortsightedness of the Free State lies in this, that it gives freedom\r\nto all, including those who use this freedom to overthrow it. We shall\r\nnot give this universal liberty, not even if it assumes the garb of\r\nimmortal principles. Finally, it is not electoral subterfuges which\r\ndivide us from Democracy. If people wish to vote, let them vote. Let us\r\nall vote until we are sick of it! Nobody wants to suppress universal\r\nsuffrage.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Policy needed._ But we shall carry out a severe and reactionary policy;\r\nwe are not afraid of doing so. If the representative organs of Democracy\r\nsay that we are reactionary it does not offend us, because what\r\ndistinguishes us from the Democrats is mentality and spirit. History\r\ndoes not follow a given itinerary; it is made up of contrasts and all\r\nkinds of vicissitudes, there are no centuries which are all light and no\r\ncenturies which are all darkness. It is not possible to transport\r\nFascismo out of Italy, as Bolshevism has been transported out of Russia.\r\n\r\nThe Italians can be divided into three categories: the indifferent, who\r\nwill stay at home; the sympathetic, who will have freedom of movement;\r\nand the antagonistic, who will have their freedom restricted. We shall\r\nmake no promises. We shall not give ourselves out as missionaries who\r\nbring the revealed truth.\r\n\r\nBut I do not think that our enemies will place serious obstacles in our\r\nway. Bolshevism is defeated. Look at the Congress of Rome. What a\r\npitiful sight! When the leader of a congress behaves like the lawyer of\r\nBusto, then you understand that we are upon the bottom rung of the\r\nladder. There was one Socialism, to-day there are four, and there is a\r\ntendency towards further divisions. And not only this, but each of these\r\ndivisions claims to represent the authentic party. It is no wonder that\r\nthe proletariat scatters, discouraged and disgusted by the attitude of\r\nSocialism. As I have already said, the day of Socialism is not only past\r\nas a party, its philosophies and doctrines no longer stand. The Italians\r\nand the Western peoples in general must burst with logical criticism the\r\ngrotesque bubble of international Socialism. Perhaps, looking at things\r\nfrom an historical point of view, it is a struggle between the East and\r\nthe West, between the chaotic, fatalistic East (look at Russia) and us,\r\nwe people of the West, who cannot be carried away by flights of\r\nmetaphysics and require hard concrete realities.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Let us flee from Imitations._ Italians cannot be mystified for long by\r\nAsiatic doctrines, which are absurd and criminal in their practical\r\napplication. This is the essence of Italian Fascismo, which represents a\r\nreaction against the Democrats who would have made everything mediocre\r\nand uniform and tried every way to conceal and to render transitory the\r\nauthority of the State, from the supreme head to the last usher in the\r\nlaw courts; consequently everybody from the King to the lowest official\r\nhas suffered from this false conception of life. Democracy thought to\r\nmake itself indispensable to the masses, and did not understand that the\r\nmasses despise those who have not the courage to be what they ought to\r\nbe. Democracy has taken “elegance” from the lives of the people, but\r\nFascismo brings it back; that is to say, it brings back colour, force,\r\npicturesqueness, the unexpected, mysticism, and in fact all that counts\r\nin the souls of the multitude. We play upon every cord of the lyre, from\r\nviolence to religion, from art to politics. We are politicians and we\r\nare warriors. We are syndicalists and we also fight battles in the\r\nstreets and the squares. That is Fascismo as it was conceived at Milan,\r\nand as it was and is realised. And, my friends, we must maintain this\r\nprivilege, and Fascismo must be kept up to this level of strength and\r\nwisdom. We must not abandon ourselves to imitations, because that which\r\nis possible in a particular agricultural region in a given time and\r\nplace is not possible here in Milan. Here the situation has been\r\ndominated more by the spontaneous maturing of events than by men’s\r\nviolence or by circumstances. Here our domination becomes more and more\r\ndecided.\r\n\r\nBut, my friends, we must prepare ourselves with hearts free from\r\npreoccupation for the tasks which await us. To-morrow it is probable,\r\nalmost certain, that the formidable burden of the direction of a modern\r\nState will be on our shoulders. And it will be on the shoulders not only\r\nof a few men, it will be on the shoulders of the whole of Fascismo.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Towards a more Glorious Destiny._ And millions of eyes, many of them\r\nmalicious, and millions of men, many of them beyond our frontiers, will\r\nbe looking at us. They will want to see how we are organised, how\r\njustice is administered in the Fascista State, how honest people are\r\nprotected, how we deal with the problems of the school and the army. And\r\nthe wrong-doing of any man, his error and his shame will react upon the\r\nwhole organisation of the State and of necessity upon Fascismo. Have\r\nyou, my friends, realised how formidable is the task which awaits you?\r\nAre you spiritually prepared for it? Do you think that enthusiasm alone\r\nis enough?—because it is not enough. It is necessary, because it is a\r\nprimitive and fundamental force in human nature, it is impossible to do\r\nanything not inspired by intense passion or religious mysticism; but\r\nthat is not enough. Together with these must work the reasoning forces\r\nof the brain. I think that in the case of a general crisis Fascismo\r\nwould have all that was necessary to impose itself and to govern, not\r\naccording to the ideas of demagogism, but according to the ideas of\r\njustice. And then, by ruling the nation well, by leading her towards a\r\nmore glorious destiny, by conciliating the interests of all classes\r\nwithout increasing the hatred of one and the selfishness of another, by\r\nuniting the Italian people to face the world-task, by fulfilling with\r\npatience this hard and cyclopean task, we shall inaugurate, thus, a\r\nreally great period in Italian history. Thus will our dead be made\r\nimmortal and their names written in the gold book of the Fascista\r\naristocracy. We shall point them out to the rising generation, to the\r\nchildren who are growing up and who represent the eternal spring of\r\nlife. We shall say: “Great was the effort and hard the sacrifice, and\r\npure was the blood that was shed; and it was not shed to safeguard the\r\ninterests of individuals, class or caste, it was not shed in the name of\r\nmaterialism, it was shed in the name of an ideal, of all that is most\r\nnoble, beautiful and generous in the human soul.” With the example of\r\nour dead before you, I ask you to remember to be worthy of their\r\nsacrifice and to examine daily your own activity. Friends, I have faith\r\nin you. You have faith in me. In this mutual trust is the guarantee and\r\ncertainty of our victory. Long live Italy! Long live Fascismo! Honour\r\nand glory to the martyrs of our cause! (Loud applause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n “THE MOMENT HAS ARRIVED WHEN THE ARROW MUST LEAVE THE BOW OR THE CORD\r\n                              WILL BREAK!”\r\n\r\n             Speech delivered at Naples, 26th October 1922.\r\n\r\n  At this, the final stage of the pilgrimage of the ever-swelling\r\n  ranks of Italian youth, where the first trench is dug in preparation\r\n  for the imminent assault of the “black shirts,” Mussolini in the\r\n  morning, as politician, hurls his vehement reproach against “the\r\n  three black souls,” the ministerial exponents of anti-Fascista\r\n  reaction. In the afternoon he shows himself in the guise of a\r\n  warrior, and, wearing the colours of Rome on his breast,\r\n  contemplates thoughtfully his fifty thousand faithful crusaders in\r\n  Piazza Plebiscito, who shout with one insistent voice, “To Rome! To\r\n  Rome!”\r\n\r\n\r\nFascisti and citizens! It may be, or rather it is almost certain, that\r\nmy eloquence will disappoint you, accustomed as you are to the\r\nimpetuosity and rich imagery of your own orators. But since I realise my\r\nincapacity for rhetoric, I have decided to limit myself, when speaking,\r\nto plain necessity.\r\n\r\nWe have gathered together here at Naples from every part of Italy to\r\nperform an act of brotherhood and love. We have with us our brothers\r\nfrom the borderland of betrayed Dalmatia, men who do not mean to yield.\r\n(Applause, and cries of “Long live Italian Dalmatia!”) There are also\r\nthe Fascisti from Trieste, Istria and Venezia Tridentina, Fascisti from\r\nall parts of Northern Italy, even from the islands, from Sicily and\r\nSardinia, all come together to affirm quietly and positively the\r\nindestructibility of our united faith, which means to oppose strongly\r\nevery more or less masked attempt at autonomy or separatism.\r\n\r\nFour years ago the Italian infantry, made great through twenty years of\r\nwork and hardship, the Italian infantry in which the sons of your\r\ncountry were so largely represented, burst from the Piave and, having\r\ndefeated the Austrians, surged on towards the Isonzo, and only the\r\nfoolish democratic conception of the war prevented our victorious\r\nbattalions from marching through the streets of Vienna and the highways\r\nof Budapest. (Applause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_From Rome to Naples._ A year ago at Rome, at one time, we found\r\nourselves surrounded by a secret hostility, which had its origin in the\r\nmisunderstandings and infamies characteristic of the uncertain political\r\nworld of the capital. (Hear, hear!) We have not forgotten all this.\r\n\r\nTo-day we are happy that all Naples—this city which I call the big\r\nsafety-reserve of the nation—(Applause.)—welcomes us with a sincere and\r\nfrank enthusiasm, which does our hearts good, both as men and Italians.\r\nFor this reason I request that not the smallest incident of any kind\r\nshall disturb this meeting, for that would be a mistake, and a foolish\r\none. I demand also, as soon as the meeting is over, that every Fascista\r\nnot belonging to Naples shall leave the town immediately.\r\n\r\nAll Italy is watching this meeting, because—and let me say this without\r\nfalse modesty—there is not a post-war phenomenon of greater interest and\r\noriginality in Europe or the world than Italian Fascismo.\r\n\r\nYou certainly cannot expect from me what is usually called a big speech.\r\nI made one at Udine, another at Cremona, a third at Milan, and I am\r\nalmost ashamed to speak again. But in view of the extremely grave\r\nsituation in which we find ourselves to-day, I consider this an\r\nappropriate opportunity to establish the different points of the problem\r\nin order that individual responsibilities may be settled. The moment has\r\narrived, in fact, when the arrow must leave the bow, or the cord, too\r\nfar stretched, will break. (Applause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Solving of the Problem._ You remember that my friend Lupi and I\r\nplaced before the Chamber the alternatives of this dilemma, which is not\r\nonly Fascista but also national; that is to say, legality or illegality;\r\nParliamentary conquest or revolution. By which means is Fascismo to\r\nbecome the State? For we wish to become the State! Well! By 3rd October\r\nI had already settled the question.\r\n\r\nWhen I ask for the elections, when I ask that they shall take place\r\nsoon, and be regulated by a reformed electoral law, it is clear to\r\neveryone that I have chosen my path. The very urgency of my request\r\nshows that the tension of my spirit has arrived at breaking point. To\r\nhave, or not to have, understood this means to hold, or not to hold, the\r\nkey to the solution of the whole Italian political crisis.\r\n\r\nThe request came from me; but it also came from a party consisting of a\r\nformidably organised mass, which includes the rising generations in\r\nItaly and all the best, physically and morally, of the youth of the\r\ncountry; and from a party, too, which had a tremendous following among\r\nthe vague and unstable public.\r\n\r\nBut, gentlemen, there is more. This request was made upon the morrow of\r\nthe incidents of Bolzano and Trento, which had made plain to all eyes\r\nthe complete paralysis of the Italian State, and revealed, at the same\r\ntime, the no less complete efficiency of the Fascista State.\r\n\r\nWell! In spite of all this, the inadequate Government at Rome puts the\r\nquestion on the footing of public safety and public order!\r\n\r\n\r\n_What we have asked the Government._ The whole question has been\r\napproached in a fatally mistaken manner. Politicians ask what we want.\r\nWe are not people who beat about the bush. We speak clearly. We do good\r\nto those who do good to us, and evil to those who do evil. What do we\r\nwant, Fascisti? We have answered quite simply: the dissolution of the\r\npresent Chamber, electoral reform, and elections within a short time\r\nfrom now. We have demanded that the State shall abandon the ridiculous\r\nneutral position that it occupies between the national and the\r\nanti-national forces. We have asked for severe financial measures and\r\nthe postponement of the evacuation of the third Dalmatic zone; we have\r\nasked for five portfolios as well as for the Commission of Aviation. We\r\nhave, in fact, asked for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the War\r\nOffice, the Admiralty, the Ministries of Labour and of Public Works. I\r\nam sure none of you will find our requests excessive. But to complete\r\nthe picture, I will add that I shall not take part with the Government\r\nin this legal solution of the problem, and the reason is obvious when\r\nyou remember that to keep Fascismo still under my control I must of\r\nnecessity have an unrestricted sphere of action both for journalistic\r\nand polemic purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Ridiculous Answer._ And what has been the Government’s reply?\r\nNothing! No; worse than that, it has given a ridiculous answer. In spite\r\nof everything, not one of the politicians has known how to pass the\r\nthreshold of Montecitorio in order to look the problem of the country in\r\nthe face. A miserable calculation of our strength has been made; there\r\nhas been talk of Ministers without portfolios, as if this, after the\r\nmore or less miserable experiences of the war, was not the culmination\r\nof human and political absurdity. There has been talk of sub-portfolios,\r\ntoo; but that is simply laughable! We Fascisti do not intend to arrive\r\nat government by the window; we do not intend to give up this\r\nmagnificent spiritual birthright for a miserable mess of ministerial\r\npottage. (Loud and prolonged applause.) Because we have what might be\r\ncalled the historical vision of the question as opposed to the merely\r\npolitical and Parliamentary view.\r\n\r\nIt is not a question of patching together a Government with a certain\r\namount of life, but of including in the Liberal State—which has\r\naccomplished a considerable task which we shall not forget—all the\r\nforces of the rising generation of Italians which issued victorious from\r\nthe war. This is essential to the welfare of the State, and not of the\r\nState only, but to the history of the nation. And then...?\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Question of Strength._ Then, gentlemen, the question, not being\r\nunderstood within its historical limits, asserts itself and becomes a\r\nquestion of strength. As a matter of fact, at turning-points of history\r\nforce always decides when it is a question of opposing interests and\r\nideas. This is why we have gathered, firmly organised and strongly\r\ndisciplined our legions, because thus, if the question must be settled\r\nby a recourse to force, we shall win. We are worthy of it. It is the\r\nright and duty of the Italian people to liberate their political and\r\nspiritual life from the parasitic incrustation of the past, which cannot\r\nbe prolonged indefinitely in the present, as it would mean the death of\r\nthe future. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nIt is then quite natural that the Government at Rome should try to\r\ndivert and counteract the movement; that it should try to break up the\r\nFascista organisation, and to surround us with problems.\r\n\r\nThese problems have the names of the Monarchy, the Army and\r\nPacification.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Acceptance of the Monarchy._ I have already said that the\r\ndiscussion, abstract or concrete, of the good and evil of the monarchy\r\nas an institution is perfectly absurd. Every people in every epoch of\r\nhistory, given the time, place and conditions necessary, has had its\r\nrégime. There is no doubt that the unity of Italy is soundly based upon\r\nthe House of Savoy. (Loud applause.) There is equally no doubt that the\r\nItalian Monarchy, both by reason of its origin, development and history,\r\ncannot put itself in opposition to the new national forces. It did not\r\nmanifest any opposition upon the occasion of the concession of the\r\nCharter, nor when the Italian people—who, even if they were a minority,\r\nwere a determined and intelligent minority—asked and obtained their\r\ncountry’s participation in the war. Would it then have reason to be in\r\nopposition to-day, when Fascismo does not intend to attack the régime,\r\nbut rather to free it from all those superstructures that overshadow its\r\nhistorical position and limit the expansion of our national spirit? Our\r\nenemies in vain try to keep this alleged misunderstanding alive.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fascismo and Democracy._ The Parliament, gentlemen, and all the\r\nparaphernalia of Democracy have nothing in common with the monarchy. Not\r\nonly this, but neither do we want to take away the people’s toy—the\r\nParliament. We say “toy” because a great part of the people seem to\r\nthink of it in this way. Can you tell me else why, out of eleven\r\nmillions of voters, six millions do not trouble themselves to vote? It\r\nmight be, however, that if to-morrow you took their “toy” away from\r\nthem, they would be aggrieved. But we will not take it away. After all,\r\nit is our mentality and our methods that distinguish us from Democracy.\r\nDemocracy thinks that principles are unchangeable when they can be\r\napplied at any time or in any place and situation.\r\n\r\nWe do not believe that history repeats itself, that it follows a given\r\npath; that after Democracy must come super-Democracy. If Democracy had\r\nits uses and served the nation in the nineteenth century, it may be that\r\nsome other political form would be best for the welfare of the nation in\r\nthe twentieth. (Well said!) So that not even fear of our anti-Democratic\r\npolicy can influence the decision in favour of that continuity of which\r\nI spoke just now.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Army._ As regards the other institution in which the régime is\r\npersonified—the army—the army knows that when the Ministry advised the\r\nofficers to go about in civilian clothes to escape attack, we, then a\r\nmere handful of bold spirits, forbade it. (Prolonged applause.) We have\r\ncreated our ideal. It is faith and ardent love. It is not necessary for\r\nit to be brought into the sphere of reality. It is reality in so far as\r\nit is a stimulus for faith, hope and courage. Our ideal is the nation.\r\nOur ideal is the greatness of the nation, and we subordinate all the\r\nrest to this.\r\n\r\nFor us the nation has a soul and does not consist only in so much\r\nterritory. There are nations that have had immense possessions and have\r\nleft no traces in the history of humanity in spite of them. It is not\r\nonly size that counts, because, on the other hand, there have been tiny,\r\nmicroscopic States that have left indelible marks in the history of art\r\nand philosophy. The greatness of a nation lies in the aggregation of all\r\nthese virtues and all these conditions. A nation is great when its\r\nspiritual force is transferred into reality. Rome was great when, from\r\nher small rural democracy, little by little, her influence spread over\r\nthe whole of Italy. Then she met the warriors of Carthage and fought\r\nthem. It was one of the first wars in history. Then, bit by bit, she\r\nextended the dominion of the Eagle to the furthermost boundaries of the\r\nknown world, but still, as ever, the Roman Empire is a creation of the\r\nspirit, as it was the spirit which first inspired the Roman legions to\r\nfight. (Applause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Our Syndicalism._ What we want now is the greatness of the nation, both\r\nmaterially and spiritually. That is why we have become syndicalist, and\r\nnot because we think that the masses by reason of their number can\r\ncreate in history something which will last. These myths of the lower\r\nkind of Socialist literature we reject. But the working people form a\r\npart of the nation; and they are a great part of the nation, necessary\r\nto its existence both in peace and in war. They neither can nor ought to\r\nbe repulsed. They can and must be educated and their legitimate\r\ninterests protected. (Applause.) We ask them: “Do you wish this state of\r\ncivil war to continue to disturb the country?” No! For we are the first\r\nto suffer from the ceaseless Sunday wrangling with its list of dead and\r\nwounded. I was the first to try to bridge over the gap which exists\r\nbetween us and what is called the Italian Bolshevist world.\r\n\r\n\r\n_How Peace can be obtained._ To prove this, I have just recently signed\r\nan agreement most gladly; in the first place because it was Gabriele\r\nd’Annunzio who asked me to, and in the second place because it was, as I\r\nthought, another step towards a national peace.\r\n\r\nBut we are no hysterical women who continually worry themselves by\r\nthinking of what might happen. We have not the catastrophic, apocalyptic\r\nview of history. The financial problem which is so much talked about is\r\na question of will-power. Millions and millions would be saved if there\r\nwere men in the Government who had the courage to say “No” to the\r\ndifferent requests. But until the financial question is brought on to a\r\npolitical basis it will not be solved. We are all for pacification, and\r\nwe should like to see all Italians find the common ground upon which it\r\nis possible for them to live together in a civilised way. But, on the\r\nother hand, we cannot give up our rights and the interests and the\r\nfuture of the nation for the sake of measures of pacification that we\r\npropose with loyalty but which are not accepted in the same spirit by\r\nthe other side. We are at peace with those who ask for peace, but for\r\nthose who ensnare us and, above all, ensnare the nation, there can be no\r\npeace until after victory.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Hymn to the Queen of the Mediterranean._ And now, Fascisti and\r\ncitizens of Naples, I thank you for the attention with which you have\r\nlistened to me.\r\n\r\nNaples gives a fine display of strength, discipline and austerity. It\r\nwas a happy idea that led to our coming here from all parts of Italy,\r\nthat has allowed us to see you as you are, to see your people who face\r\nthe struggle for life like Romans, and who, with the desire to rebuild\r\ntheir lives and to gain wealth through hard work, carry ever in their\r\nhearts the love of this their wonderful town, which is destined to a\r\ngreat future, especially if Fascismo does not deviate from its path.\r\n\r\nNor must the Democrats say that there is no need for Fascismo here, as\r\nthere has been no Bolshevism, for here there are other political\r\nmovements no less dangerous than Bolshevism and no less likely to hinder\r\nthe development of the public conscience.\r\n\r\nI already see the Naples of the future endowed with an even greater\r\nsplendour as the metropolis of the Mediterranean; and I see it together\r\nwith Bari (which in 1805 had sixteen thousand inhabitants and now has\r\none hundred and fifty thousand) and Palermo forming a powerful triangle.\r\nAnd I see Fascismo concentrating all these energies, purifying certain\r\ncircles, and removing certain members of society, gathering others under\r\nits standards.\r\n\r\nAnd now, members of the Fascio of all Italy, lift up your flags and\r\nsalute Naples, the capital of Southern Italy and the Queen of the\r\nMediterranean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 PART V\r\n             MUSSOLINI THE “FASCISTA MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     FASCISMO AND THE NEW PROVINCES\r\n\r\n            Speech delivered in the Chamber, 21st June 1921.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hon. Mussolini._ I am not displeased, gentlemen, to make my speech from\r\nthe benches of the Extreme Right, where formerly no one dared to sit.\r\n\r\nI may say at once, with the supreme contempt I have for all nominalism,\r\nthat I shall adopt a reactionary line throughout my speech, which will\r\nbe, I do not know how Parliamentary in form, but anti-Socialist and\r\nanti-Democratic in substance. (Approval.) In spite of this I am\r\naudacious enough to affirm that I shall be listened to with advantage by\r\nall sections of the Chamber. In the first place by the Government, which\r\nwill notice our position with regard to it. In the second place by the\r\nSocialists, who, after seven years of changing fortunes, see before\r\nthem, in the proud attitude of a heretic, the man they excommunicated\r\nfrom their orthodox church. They will listen to me, too, because, having\r\nheld their fortunes in the palm of my hand for two years, there may\r\nstill be some secret longings for me in the depths of their hearts!\r\n\r\nI may also be listened to with interest by the Popular Party and the\r\nother groups and sections. In fact, since I hope to define some\r\npolitical aspects, and I may add some historical ones, of this extremely\r\npowerful and complicated movement Fascismo, perhaps what I have to say\r\nmay have political consequences worthy of note.\r\n\r\nI beg you not to interrupt me, because I shall never interrupt anybody,\r\nand I add that from this moment I shall make sparing use of my freedom\r\nof speech in this Assembly.\r\n\r\nAnd now to the argument.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Italophobia on the Upper Adige._ In the speech from the throne, the\r\nHon. Giolitti made the Sovereign say that the barrier of the Alps was\r\nentirely in our hands. I dispute the geographical and political\r\nexactness of this statement. We have not yet, at a few kilometres from\r\nMilan, the barrier of the Alps as the defence of Lombardy and the valley\r\nof the Po.\r\n\r\nI am touching on a delicate subject, but it is well known, both in this\r\nChamber and elsewhere, that in the Canton Ticino, which is being\r\nGermanised and bastardised, there is springing up a nationalist vanguard\r\nwhom the Fascisti look on with favour.\r\n\r\nWhat is the present Government doing to defend the Alpine barrier of the\r\nBrenner and the Nevoso? Its policy, as regards the Upper Adige, is\r\nsimply lamentable and, though its representatives would doubtless be\r\nextremely capable of running a kindergarten, I absolutely deny that they\r\nhave the necessary qualifications for governing a region where several\r\nlanguages are spoken and the rivalry between the races is very bitter.\r\nThe Governor of Venezia Tridentina, for instance, has made a present of\r\nthe constituency of Gorizia to the Slovaks and of four German deputies\r\nto the Italian Chamber; while the other belongs to that category of more\r\nor less respectable people who are slaves to one so-called immortal\r\nprinciple, which consists in maintaining that there is only one form of\r\ngood government in the world, and that it is applicable to all peoples,\r\nat all times, and in all quarters of the globe.\r\n\r\nAllow me to put before the Chamber the results of a few personal\r\nenquiries I have made into the situation on the Upper Adige.\r\n\r\nThe political anti-Italian movement on the Upper Adige is monopolised by\r\nthe Deutscher Verband, an offspring of the Andreas Hoferbund, which has\r\nits centre at Munich, and claims that the German frontier is not at the\r\nPass of Salorno but at the Bern Clause or Chiusa di Verona.\r\n\r\nNow the representative of whom I have just spoken is responsible for\r\nthis German propaganda, because he has written the preface to a book\r\nwhich states that the natural boundaries of Germany are at the foot of\r\nthe Alps towards the valley of the Po. In the first days of the military\r\noccupation, immediately after the Armistice, this Italophobia was not\r\npossible; but when, by a great misfortune, this governor was appointed,\r\nthe attitude of the people changed immediately and the submission\r\npreviously shown was succeeded by an insolent arrogance, which denied\r\nthe Austrian reverses and kept alive the desire for the return of the\r\nHapsburgs.\r\n\r\nAt the sample fair organised by the Chamber of Commerce of Bolzano, a\r\nnest of Pangermanism, all Italian firms were excluded, so much so that\r\nthe invitations were issued in German, and a Bavarian band played for\r\nthe whole duration of the fair!\r\n\r\nI come now to the events of 24th April, when a Fascista bomb, justly\r\nadministered by way of reprisal, and for which I take upon myself the\r\nmoral responsibility—(Loud applause and comments.)—marked the limit to\r\nwhich Fascismo intended that the German movement should go.\r\n\r\nThe demonstration of 24th April in the Tyrol was only a simultaneous\r\nmanifestation to the plebiscite which had been summoned that day beyond\r\nthe Brenner, because the Germans in the Upper Adige resort to these\r\nsubtle tricks of making the same manifestations under different guises.\r\nIn this way, when they publicly mourned the loss of the Upper Adige on\r\nthis side of the Brenner, on the other they did the same for the fallen\r\nAustrian soldiers. When the Fascisti presented themselves at Bolzano,\r\nthey found the police helmeted and tasselled, and when they were\r\narrested, the enquiry was entrusted to Count Breitemburg, a notorious\r\nmember of the Deutscher Verband.\r\n\r\nI will not linger over the cases of Malmeter, because they are more like\r\nthe chapters of a novel. But I cannot help mentioning one most curious\r\nepisode.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner of Merano went to the commune of Maja Alta and was\r\nreceived, not in the town hall, but in an old mansion house, where were\r\ngathered the mayor and the councillors. The commissioner read the form\r\nof the oath, and the mayor and the councillors, sitting down\r\nimmediately, put on their hats and burst out laughing. The commissioner\r\nhad hardly recovered from his surprise when the mayor rose to his feet\r\nand began a storm of abuse against the King, Italy and the commissioner,\r\nwho, returning to Merano, requested the dismissal of this council. But\r\nthe Deutscher Verband interceded with the governor, who returned the\r\ncommissioner’s report, writing at the same time that it was not a good\r\nthing to practise irredentism. And the representatives of the commune\r\nremained as they were!\r\n\r\nSince the period of mismanagement the Upper Adige is no longer\r\nbi-lingual. The mayor himself refused to accept the evidence he had\r\nasked for concerning the events of 24th April, because they were written\r\nin Italian. These are small individual cases, but they serve to give an\r\nidea of the whole situation.\r\n\r\nAt Megré the Italophobe president of the Young Catholics’ Club turned\r\nout two young men because they presented their demands in Italian,\r\nsaying that that language would not do for his office and telling them\r\nto keep it for themselves. And among all those competing for the office\r\nof President of the Court of Appeal of redeemed Italian Trento, the one\r\nselected was a man who in 1915 had resigned his magistracy in order to\r\nserve as a “Kaiser-Jäger” volunteer under the Austrian flag. To-day this\r\nman administers justice in the name of Italy! (Comments.)\r\n\r\nIf you imagine that the postal and telegraphic services in the Upper\r\nAdige are in Italian hands, you are much mistaken. The Deutscher Verband\r\nhas control of all the communications and disposes of them at its\r\npleasure. Although 24th April was a holiday, the Pangermans and the\r\nheads of the movement at Innsbruck were kept informed all along of the\r\ndevelopment of events at Bolzano, while all communications with the\r\ncivil and military authorities were cut and the town completely isolated\r\nfrom Trento and the rest of Italy for twenty-four hours. This is the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_What the Fascisti ask as regards the Upper Adige._ Gentlemen of the\r\nGovernment, as regards the Upper Adige, we ask you for these immediate\r\nmeasures:\r\n\r\n1. The abolition of everything which reminds us of the Austro-Hungarian\r\nMonarchy, even in outward form. Because I wish to say to the House that\r\nit is useless to make compacts to prevent the return of the Hapsburgs\r\nwith the Austrian heirs, who are more Austrian than Austria, when we\r\nleave a great part of Austria intact within our own boundaries.\r\n\r\n2. The dissolution of the Deutscher Verband.\r\n\r\n3. The immediate dismissal of the two Italian governors.\r\n\r\n4. The formation of a united province of Trento with the administration\r\nat Trento, and the strictest observance of the use of the two languages\r\nin every act of public administration.\r\n\r\nI do not know what measures will be adopted by the Government in these\r\ncases, but I hereby declare, and I do so before the four German deputies\r\nthat they may repeat it and make it known beyond the Brenner, that there\r\nwe are and there we mean to stay at all costs. (Applause.)\r\n\r\n_Giolitti_ (Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior). Upon this we\r\nare all agreed. (Applause.)\r\n\r\n_Mussolini._ I note with pleasure the explicit declaration the Prime\r\nMinister has just made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               THE QUESTION OF MONTENEGRO’S INDEPENDENCE\r\n\r\n         Same speech delivered in the Chamber, 21st June 1921.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hon. Mussolini._ What is going to be our line of policy in view of the\r\nvast field for disagreement which has been left by the peace treaty, or\r\nrather peace treaties, all over the world?\r\n\r\nI shall not touch upon the quarrel between Greece and Turkey, although\r\ninconceivable complications may result if it is true, as is said, that\r\nLenin is an ally of Kemal Pasha and has already despatched the advance\r\nguard of the Red army to Asia Minor. Neither shall I speak of Upper\r\nSilesia, as I have not yet succeeded in defining the attitude of the\r\nGovernment on this question. Egypt, again, I shall leave untouched. But\r\nI cannot hold my peace about the fate prepared for Montenegro.\r\n\r\nHow is it that Montenegro has lost her independence? In theory she has\r\nnot lost it, but actually she lost it in October 1918. And yet Count\r\nSforza said that the independence of Montenegro was completely\r\nguaranteed, first by the Treaty of London of 1915, which presupposed her\r\naggrandisement at the expense of Austria and the restitution of Scutari;\r\nsecondly, by the conditions laid down by Wilson for the Allies, which\r\nsafeguarded her existence with that of Belgium and Serbia; and thirdly,\r\nby the decision of the Supreme Council of the Conference of January\r\n1919, in which the right of Montenegro to be represented by a Delegate\r\nat the Paris Peace Conference was recognised. Not only this, but when\r\nFranchet d’Esperey entered Montenegro with Serb and French elements, he\r\ngave out that he was governing in the name of King Nicholas.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, King Nicholas, the Court and the Government wished to\r\nreturn to Cettinge, France, in whose interest it was to create a\r\npowerful Yugoslavia to counterbalance Italy in the Adriatic, informed\r\nthe Montenegrin Government that she would have broken off all diplomatic\r\nrelations had they done so.\r\n\r\nWhat attitude did Italy adopt in this difficult situation? The Hon.\r\nFederzoni spoke yesterday of a Convention that became a scrap of paper;\r\nand it was this Convention of 30th April 1919. In it the relations\r\nbetween Italy and Montenegro are clearly established. And this is what\r\nit says: “Following upon the agreement made between the Italian Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs and the Government of Montenegro” (so there _was_ a\r\nGovernment still in 1919), “represented by their Consul General at Rome,\r\nCommander Ramanadovich, the Montenegrin Government will form a nucleus\r\nof officers and troops, drawn from the Montenegrin refugees, and will\r\nreceive from the Italian Government the necessary funds in money for the\r\npayment of the allowances of the officers and men.” Other conditions\r\nfollow, the last being: “The present Convention cannot be altered\r\nwithout the common consent of both the Italian and Montenegrin\r\nGovernments.”\r\n\r\nNow this Convention was destroyed after the death of King Nicholas.\r\nSigns of disaffection were noticed among the Montenegrin troops, and the\r\ncommander asked for military aid from our Government, in order to\r\nproceed to the work of elimination. A Commission was appointed, presided\r\nover by Colonel Vigevano. This commission, which was to save the\r\nMontenegrin army, was the chief cause of its disbandment. And not only\r\nthis—on 27th May the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs told the\r\nMontenegrin Government that the troops must be disbanded or no more\r\nfunds would be forthcoming from Italy. And in this way the Convention of\r\n30th April 1919 was violated, because in it it had been said that no\r\nalteration was to be made without the common consent of the two\r\nGovernments, and this decision had never been accepted by the consul\r\ngeneral at Rome, who represented the Montenegrin Government. The fact is\r\nthat the Italian Minister had made use of the presence of the\r\nMontenegrin army in Italy for political purposes, thinking thereby to\r\nobtain better terms with Yugoslavia. This expectation not being\r\nrealised, the Montenegrin army, at a given moment, was cast aside like a\r\nworn-out coat. The fact of the election of the Constituent does not\r\njustify the tragic state of abandonment in which Italy left Montenegro,\r\nbecause only twenty per cent. of the electors voted, and of those only\r\nnine per cent. in favour of annexation by Serbia. The Serbian\r\nauthorities have introduced a real reign of terror in Montenegro and\r\nhave prevented the presentation of lists which might contain the names\r\nof candidates favourable to the independence of the country.\r\n\r\nBut I hope Count Sforza will not think that the question of Montenegro\r\nis a thing of the past. First, as he knows, the Montenegrin people are\r\nstill in arms against the Serbs, and secondly, the Italian people are\r\nunanimous as regards this question. Even the Socialists, and I say it to\r\ntheir honour, have several times declared in their papers that the\r\nindependence of Montenegro is sacred. The Universities of Padua and\r\nBologna have pronounced in favour of her independence, while the\r\nFascisti have presented a motion to this effect.\r\n\r\nThe shameful page which signs the death warrant of the Montenegrin\r\npeople must be redeemed by the adoption of our motion, because if you\r\nbring the question once more before the Great Powers, so that another\r\nplebiscite be summoned, I am certain that, under conditions of liberty,\r\nanti-Serbian results will be returned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          D’ANNUNZIO AND FIUME\r\n\r\n         Same speech delivered in the Chamber, 21st June 1921.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hon. Mussolini._ In the speech from the throne, the Alps which go\r\ndown to the Brenner were spoken of. Now we wish to know if these\r\nAlps include Fiume or not. I deplore the fact that in this speech no\r\nnotice was given to the action of Gabriele d’Annunzio and his\r\nlegionaries—(Applause.)—without whom our boundaries to-day would be\r\nat Monte Maggiore instead of at the Nevoso. Such a reference would\r\nhave been generous, as well as politically opportune.\r\n\r\nI do not intend to enlarge upon the sacrifice of Dalmatia. My honourable\r\nfriend Federzoni spoke very eloquently on the subject yesterday. But I\r\nwas surprised when in that same speech from the throne it was affirmed\r\nthat Zara must be the advance guard of Italy on the opposite shores,\r\nbecause Zara is crushed between the Slav sea and the Slav hinterland.\r\n\r\nWhile upon the subject of the Adriatic, gentlemen, we Fascisti cannot\r\nforget, we who speak for the first time in this hall, the attitude that\r\nyou adopted in the affair of Fiume. We cannot forget that you attacked\r\nFiume; and that when on 28th December General Ferrario said that he\r\ncould not suspend the order for the bombardment that would have levelled\r\nthat town to the ground, that general and the Government that gave him\r\nthe order compromised our national dignity more than a little. (Approval\r\non the Right.)\r\n\r\nYou put a knife to the throat of Fiume, but you did not solve the\r\nproblem. You sent a commander there with an amazing scheme for the\r\nformation of a Government, which was to accept the conditions agreed\r\nupon at Belgrade—accept, that is to say, the Consortium, which means the\r\nnear, if not immediate, destruction of the port of Fiume. Because you\r\nare well aware that after the lapse of twelve years Porto Barro and the\r\nDelta ought to go to Yugoslavia, and you have already handed them over,\r\nbecause, if you had not done so, you would have been obliged to make\r\nstatements which have not been made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          ITALY, SIONISM, AND THE ENGLISH MANDATE IN PALESTINE\r\n\r\n         Same speech delivered in the Chamber, 21st June 1921.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hon. Mussolini._ I come now to another very delicate question that must\r\nbe faced, because it is historically necessary and because, in view of\r\nthe recent Pontifical Allocution before the Secret Consistory, it can no\r\nlonger be put off.\r\n\r\nWe must choose: the Government must decide what line it is going to take\r\nup. Either it must adopt the English attitude in favour of the Sionists,\r\nor that of Benedict XV. I do not think that I shall be boring the\r\nChamber if I run over the antecedents of this question.\r\n\r\nOn 2nd November 1917, the English Government declared itself in favour\r\nof the creation in Palestine of a national centre for the Jewish race,\r\nit being clearly understood that nothing would be done to offend the\r\nrights, civil or religious, of the non-Jewish communities already\r\nexisting in Palestine or of the Jews in the rest of the world. Later the\r\nAllied Powers agreed to this, and finally, in Article No. 222 of the\r\nPeace Treaty, confirmed on 20th August at Sèvres, Turkey renounced all\r\nher rights in Palestine, and the Allied Powers chose England as\r\nmandatory.\r\n\r\nNow it has come about, that while the civilised nations of the West have\r\nnot altered the common régime of liberty for the different religions, in\r\nPalestine just the reverse has happened, and this in particular because\r\nthe administration of the State in embryo has been entrusted to the\r\npolitical organisation of the Sionists.\r\n\r\nBut there have been Arabs in Palestine for ten centuries. There are\r\n600,000 now, and 70,000 Christians, while the Jews only number 50,000.\r\nIn this way an extraordinarily interesting situation has been created.\r\n\r\nThe native Jews, who have lived for years under the shadow of the mosque\r\nof Jerusalem, cordially dislike those immigrant elements which come from\r\nPoland, Ukraine and Russia, on account of their extremely emancipated\r\nideas. They have already divided into three sections, one of which,\r\ncommonly known by its abbreviated name “Mopsy,” being already inscribed\r\nin the Third International at Moscow as Communist Section.\r\n\r\nI wish to say, however, that no anti-Semitism, which would be new in\r\nthis hall, must be read into my words.\r\n\r\nI recognise the fact that the sacrifices made by the Italian Jews during\r\nthe war were considerable and generous, but now it is a question of\r\nexamining certain political positions and of indicating what line the\r\nGovernment might eventually adopt.\r\n\r\nAn alliance between the Arabs and the Christians has now been\r\nestablished in Palestine, and a party formed at the Conference of Jaffa,\r\nwhich opposes by civil war all Jewish immigration. On the 1st and 14th\r\nof May, serious disturbances occurred which resulted in some hundreds of\r\nwounded and several deaths, including a writer of note.\r\n\r\nNow, according to the _Bulletin du Comité des Délégations Juives_, page\r\n19, it appears that the text of the English Mandate for Palestine must\r\nbe submitted to the Council of the Society of the League of Nations in\r\nthe next meeting at Geneva. I should wish the Government, in this\r\ndelicate situation, to accept the point of view of the Vatican.\r\n\r\nThis is in the interest of the Jews, who, having fled from the pogroms\r\nof Ukraine and Poland, must not meet Arab pogroms in Palestine;\r\nmoreover, it is advisable that the Western nations should refrain from\r\ncreating a painful legal position for the Jews, since to-morrow those\r\nsame Jews, becoming citizen-subjects of those States, might immediately\r\nform foreign colonies within them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        THE ATTITUDE OF FASCISMO TOWARDS COMMUNISM AND SOCIALISM\r\n\r\n         Same speech delivered in the Chamber, 21st June 1921.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hon. Mussolini._ I do not wish to enlarge upon the question of foreign\r\npolicy, as I should then find myself out in the open, and I might ask\r\nthe Minister for Foreign Affairs what Italy’s position exactly is in the\r\nface of the formidable conflicts which loom upon the horizon of\r\ninternational politics. While Count Sforza is at the head of Foreign\r\nAffairs in Giolitti’s Cabinet, we Fascisti cannot but find ourselves\r\namong the opposition. (Comments.)\r\n\r\nI shall pass now to an examination of the position of Fascismo with\r\nregard to the various parties—(Signs of attention.)—and I shall begin\r\nwith the Communists.\r\n\r\nCommunism, the Hon. Graziadei teaches me, springs up in times of misery\r\nand despair. When the total sum of the wealth of the world is much\r\nreduced, the first idea that enters men’s minds is to put it all\r\ntogether so that everyone may have a little. But this is only the first\r\nphase of Communism, the phase of consumption. Afterwards comes the phase\r\nof production, which is very much more difficult; so difficult, indeed,\r\nthat that great and formidable man (not yet legislator) who answers to\r\nthe name of Wladimiro Ulianoff Lenin, when he came to shaping human\r\nmaterial, became aware that it was a good deal harder than bronze or\r\nmarble. (Approval and comments.)\r\n\r\nI know the Communists. I know them, because a great many of them are my\r\nsons—I mean, of course, spiritually—(Laughter.)—and I recognise with a\r\nsincerity that might appear cynical, that it was I who first inoculated\r\nthese people, when I put into circulation among the Italian Socialists a\r\nlittle Bergson mingled with much Blanqui.\r\n\r\nThere is a philosopher[10] sitting among the Ministers who certainly\r\nteaches me that the neo-spiritualistic philosophies continually\r\noscillating between the metaphysical and the lyrical are very dangerous\r\nfor small minds. (Laughter.) The neo-spiritualistic philosophies are\r\nlike oysters—they are palatable, but they have to be digested.\r\n(Laughter.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 10:\r\n\r\n  Benedetto Croce, Minister of Public Instruction.\r\n\r\nThese, my friends or enemies....\r\n\r\n(Voices from the Extreme Left: “Enemies, enemies!”)\r\n\r\n_Mussolini._ Very well, then—enemies, swallowed Bergson when they were\r\ntwenty-five and have not digested him at thirty. I am very surprised to\r\nsee among the Communists an economist of the standing of Antonio\r\nGraziadei, with whom I had great battles when he was a reformer and had\r\nthrown aside Marx and his doctrines. While the Communists speak of the\r\ndictatorship of the proletariat, of republics more or less united with\r\nthe Soviet, and other far-fetched absurdities of that kind, between them\r\nand us there cannot be other than war. (Interruptions from the Extreme\r\nLeft. Comments.)\r\n\r\nOur position is different as regards the Socialist Party. In the first\r\nplace we are careful to make a distinction between party Socialism and\r\nthe Socialism of Labour. (Comments on the Extreme Left.)\r\n\r\nI am not here to overrate the importance of the syndicalist movement.\r\nWhen you think that there are sixteen millions of working men in Italy\r\nand of these hardly three millions belong to the syndicates, whether the\r\nGeneral Conference of Workmen, the National Italian Syndicate, the\r\nItalian Workmen’s Union, the Confederation of Italian Economic\r\nSyndicates, the White Federation or other organisations which do not\r\nconcern us, and that their membership increases and diminishes according\r\nto the times; when you think that the really advanced and scrupulous\r\nthinkers are a scanty minority, you will realise at once that we are\r\nright when we do not overrate the historical importance of this movement\r\nof the working classes.\r\n\r\nBut we recognise the fact that the General Federation of Workers did not\r\nmanifest the attitude of hostility at the time of the war which was\r\nshown by a great part of the Official Socialist Party. We recognise,\r\nalso, that through the General Federation of Workers technical forces\r\nhave come to the front which, in view of the fact that the organisers\r\nare in direct and daily contact with the complex economic reality, are\r\nreasonable enough. (Interruptions from the Extreme Left and comments.)\r\n\r\nWe—and there are witnesses here who can prove the truth of my words—have\r\nnever taken up _a priori_ an attitude of opposition to the General\r\nFederation of Workers. I add also that our attitude might be altered\r\nlater if the Confederation detached itself—and the political directors\r\nhave for some time considered the possibility of this being done—from\r\nthe political Socialist Party—(Comments.)—which is only a fraction of\r\npolitical Socialism, and is formed of those people who, in order to act,\r\nhave need of the big forces represented by the working-class\r\norganisations.\r\n\r\nListen to what I am going to say. When you present the Bill for the\r\nEight Hours Day, we will vote in favour of it. We shall not oppose this\r\nor any other measures destined to perfect our special legislation. We\r\nshall not even oppose experiments of co-operation; but I tell you at\r\nonce that we shall resist with all our strength attempts at State\r\nSocialism, Collectivism and the like. We have had enough of State\r\nSocialism, and we shall never cease to fight your doctrines as a whole,\r\nfor we deny their truth and oppose their fatalism.\r\n\r\nWe deny the existence of only two classes, because there are many more.\r\n(Comments.) We deny the possibility of explaining the story of humanity\r\nin terms of economics. We deny your internationalism, because it is a\r\nluxury which only the upper classes can afford; the working people are\r\nhopelessly bound to their native shores.\r\n\r\nNot only this, but we affirm, and on the strength of recent Socialist\r\nliterature which you ought not to repudiate, that the real history of\r\ncapitalism is beginning now, because capitalism is not only a system of\r\noppression, but a selection of that which is of most worth, a\r\nco-ordination of hierarchies, a more strongly developed sense of\r\nindividual responsibility. (Applause.) So true is this that Lenin, after\r\nhaving instituted the building councils, abolished them and put in\r\ndictators; so true is it that, after having nationalised commerce, he\r\nreintroduced the régime of liberty; and, as you who have been in Russia\r\nwell know, after having suppressed—even physically—the bourgeoisie,\r\nto-day he summons it back, because without capitalism and its technical\r\nsystem of production Russia could never rise again. (Applause from the\r\nRight. Comments.)\r\n\r\nLet me speak to you frankly and tell you the mistakes you made after the\r\nArmistice, fundamental mistakes which are destined to influence the\r\nhistory of your politics.\r\n\r\nFirst of all you ignored or underrated the survival of those forces\r\nwhich had been the cause of intervention in the war. Your paper went to\r\nridiculous lengths, never mentioning my name for months, as if by that\r\nyou could eliminate a man from life and history. You showed yourselves\r\nworse knaves than ever by libelling the war and victory. (Loud approval\r\non the Right.) You wildly propagated the Russian myth, awakening almost\r\nmessianic expectation; and only afterwards, when you realised the truth,\r\ndid you change your position by executing a more or less prudent\r\nstrategic retreat. (Laughter.) Only after two years did you remember,\r\nbeside the sickle—a noble tool—and the hammer—no less noble—to place the\r\nbook—(Bravo!)—which represents the rights of the spirit over matter,\r\nrights which cannot be suppressed or denied—(Bravo!)—rights which you,\r\nwho consider yourselves the heralds of a new humanity, ought to be the\r\nfirst to inscribe upon your banners. (Great applause from the Extreme\r\nRight.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE ATTITUDE OF FASCISMO TOWARDS THE POPULAR PARTY. THE VATICAN AND\r\n                            SOCIAL DEMOCRACY\r\n\r\n         Same speech delivered in the Chamber, 21st June 1921.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hon. Mussolini._ I come now to the Popular Party; and I wish to remind\r\nit first that in the history of Fascismo there are no invasions of\r\nchurches, and not even the assassination of the monk Angelico Galassi,\r\nwho was killed by revolver shots at the foot of the altar. I confess to\r\nyou that there have been some chastisements and the sacred burning of\r\nthe offices of a newspaper which called the Fascisti a band of\r\ncriminals. (Comments; interruptions from the Centre.)\r\n\r\nFascismo neither practises nor preaches anti-Clericalism. It can also be\r\nsaid that it is not in any way tied to Freemasonry; this, however,\r\nshould not be the cause of alarm which it is to some members of the\r\nPopular Party, as to my mind Freemasonry is an enormous screen behind\r\nwhich there are generally small things and small men. (Comments and\r\nlaughter.) But let us come to concrete problems.\r\n\r\nThe question of divorce has been touched on here. I am not, at bottom,\r\nin favour of divorce, because I do not believe that questions of the\r\nsentimental order can be settled by juridical formulæ; but I ask the\r\nPopular Party to consider if it is just that the rich can obtain divorce\r\nby going into Hungary, while the poor are sometimes obliged to be tied\r\nall their lives.\r\n\r\nWe are one with the Popular Party as regards the liberty of schools. We\r\nare very near them as regards the agrarian problem, for we think that\r\nwhere small properties exist it is useless to destroy them; that where\r\nit is possible to create them, they ought to be created; that where they\r\ncannot be created, because they would be unproductive, other methods\r\nmust be adopted, not excluding more or less collective co-operation. We\r\nagree about administrative decentralisation, provided, necessarily, that\r\nautonomy and federation are not spoken of, because regional federation\r\nwould lead to provincial federation, and so on till Italy returned to\r\nwhat she was a century ago.\r\n\r\nBut there is another problem more important than these incidental\r\nquestions to which I wish to draw the attention of the Popular Party,\r\nand that is the historical problem of the relations between Italy and\r\nthe Vatican. (Signs of attention.)\r\n\r\nAll of us, who from fifteen to twenty-five drank deep at the fountain of\r\nCarduccian literature, learned to hate “una vecchia vaticana lupa\r\ncruenta” of which Carducci speaks, I think, in the ode _To Ferrara_; we\r\nheard talk of “a pontificate dark with mystery” on the one hand, and on\r\nthe other of the sublime truth and the future in the words of the\r\npoet-prophet. Now all this, confined to literature, may be most\r\nbrilliant, but to us Fascisti, who are eminently practical, it seems\r\nto-day more than a little out of date.\r\n\r\nI maintain that the Imperial and Latin tradition of Rome is represented\r\nto-day by Catholicism. If, as Mommsen said thirty years ago, one could\r\nnot stay in Rome without being impressed by the idea of universality, I\r\nboth think and maintain that the only universal idea at Rome to-day is\r\nthat which radiates from the Vatican. I am very disturbed when I see\r\nnational churches being formed, because I think of the millions and\r\nmillions of men who will no longer look towards Italy and Rome. For this\r\nreason I advance this hypothesis, that if the Vatican should definitely\r\nrenounce its temporal ambitions—and I think it is already on that\r\nroad—Italy ought to furnish it with the necessary material help for the\r\nschools, churches, hospitals, etc., that a temporal power has at its\r\ndisposal. Because the increase of Catholicism in the world, the addition\r\nof four hundred millions of men who from all quarters of the globe look\r\ntowards Rome, is a source of pride and of special interest to us\r\nItalians.\r\n\r\nThe Popular Party must choose; either it is going to be our friend, our\r\nenemy or neutral. Now that I have spoken clearly, I hope that some\r\nmember of the party will do likewise.\r\n\r\nSocial Democracy seems to have a very ambiguous position. First of all\r\none wonders why it is called Social Democracy. A democracy is already\r\nnecessarily social; we think, however, that this Social Democracy is a\r\nkind of Trojan horse which holds within it an army against whom we shall\r\nalways be at war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PART VI\r\n                MUSSOLINI THE “FASCISTA PRIME MINISTER”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                MUSSOLINI THE “FASCISTA PRIME MINISTER”\r\n\r\n  We deem it superfluous to linger over a detailed analysis of the\r\n  separate speeches delivered by Benito Mussolini after 1st November\r\n  1922, the day on which, by the will of the people, he rose fully\r\n  equipped to the dignities and responsibilities of power.\r\n\r\n  Foreigners are to a great extent ignorant of the origin, the\r\n  character and the evolution of the Fascista movement, owing to the\r\n  lack of literature on the subject outside Italy. They have, however,\r\n  already had the means of appreciating the qualities of strength,\r\n  balance of mind, and foresight revealed from the very first by the\r\n  Italian Fascista Premier. Although European public opinion may be\r\n  logically entitled to an attitude of reserve in the face of the\r\n  crisis of evolution and renovation through which Italy is passing,\r\n  it is certain that the young President of the Council—of humble\r\n  birth, and risen to power by a remarkable combination of\r\n  circumstances—romantic, daring, ingenious, tempestuous—stands now\r\n  the principal figure in the arena of world politics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    A NEW CROMWELL IN THE PARLIAMENT\r\n\r\n          Speech delivered in the Chamber, 16th November 1922.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hon. Mussolini._ Honourable Members,—(Signs of great attention.)—I\r\nperform to-day in this hall an act of formal deference towards you for\r\nwhich I do not expect any special gratitude.\r\n\r\nI have the honour of announcing to the Chamber that His Majesty the\r\nKing, by a Decree of 31st October, has accepted the resignations of the\r\nHon. Luigi Facta from the office of President of the Council and of his\r\ncolleagues, Minister and Under-Secretaries of State, and has asked me to\r\nform the new Ministry. On the same day His Majesty has appointed me\r\nPresident of the Council of Ministers and Minister of the Interior and\r\nof Foreign Affairs, etc.\r\n\r\nFor many years—for too many years—crises in the Government took place\r\nand were solved by more or less tortuous and underhand manœuvres, so\r\nmuch so that a crisis came to be regarded as a regular scramble for\r\nportfolios, and the Ministry was caricatured in the comic papers.\r\n\r\nNow, for the second time in the brief space of seven years, the Italian\r\npeople, or rather the best part of it, has overthrown a Ministry and\r\nformed for itself an entirely new Government from outside, regardless of\r\nevery Parliamentary designation.\r\n\r\nThe seven years of which I speak lie between the May of 1915 and the\r\nOctober of 1922. I shall leave to the gloomy partisans of\r\nsuper-Constitutionalism the task of discoursing, more or less\r\nplaintively, about all this. I maintain that revolution has its rights;\r\nand I may add, so that everyone may know, that I am here to defend and\r\ngive the greatest value to the revolution of the “black shirts,”\r\ninserting it intrinsically in the history of the nation as an active\r\nforce in development, progress and the restoration of equilibrium. (Loud\r\napplause from the Left.) I could have carried our victory much further,\r\nand I refused to do so. I imposed limits upon my action and told myself\r\nthat the truest wisdom is that which does not forsake one after victory.\r\nWith three hundred thousand young men, fully armed, ready for anything\r\nand almost religiously prompt to obey any command of mine, I could have\r\npunished all those who have slandered the Fascisti and thrown mud at\r\nthem. (Approval on the Right.) I could have made a bivouac of this\r\ngloomy grey hall; I could have shut up Parliament and formed a\r\nGovernment of Fascisti exclusively; I could have done so, but I did not\r\nwish to do so, at any rate at the moment. Our adversaries remained in\r\ntheir shelters and then quietly issued forth and obtained their freedom,\r\nof which they are already taking advantage to set traps for us and\r\nslander us, as at Carate, Bergamo, Udine and Muggia.\r\n\r\nI have formed a Coalition Government, not with the intention of\r\nobtaining a Parliamentary majority, with which at the moment I can\r\nperfectly well dispense, but in order to gather together in support of\r\nthe suffering nation all those who, over and above questions of party\r\nand section, wish to save her.\r\n\r\nFrom the bottom of my heart I thank all those who have worked with me,\r\nboth Ministers and Under-Secretaries; I thank my colleagues in the\r\nGovernment, who wished to share with me the heavy responsibilities of\r\nthis hour; and I cannot remember without pleasure the attitude of the\r\nItalian working classes, who indirectly encouraged and strengthened the\r\nFascisti by their solidarity, active or passive. I believe also that I\r\nshall be giving expression to the thoughts of a large part of this\r\nassembly, and certainly of the majority of the Italian people, if I pay\r\na warm tribute to our Sovereign, who, by refusing to permit the useless\r\nreactionary attempts made at the eleventh hour to proclaim martial law,\r\nhas avoided civil war and allowed the fresh and ardent Fascista current,\r\nnewly arisen out of the war and exalted by victory, to pour itself into\r\nthe sluggish main stream of the State. (Cries of “Long live the King!”\r\nThe Ministers and a great many deputies rise to their feet and applaud.)\r\n\r\nBefore arriving here we were asked on all sides for a programme. It is\r\nnot, alas! programmes that are wanting in Italy, but men to carry them\r\nout. All the problems of Italian life—_all_, I say—have long since been\r\nsolved on paper; but the will to put these solutions into practice has\r\nbeen lacking. The Government to-day represents that firm and decisive\r\nwill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             THE FOREIGN POLICY OF THE FASCISTA GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n       Same speech delivered in the Chamber, 16th November 1922.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hon. Mussolini._ Honourable Members,—Our foreign policy is the business\r\nwhich chiefly concerns us at the present moment. I shall speak of it at\r\nonce, as I think that what I am going to say will dispel many\r\napprehensions. I shall not touch upon all the questions connected with\r\nthe subject, because, in this sphere as in all others, I prefer actions\r\nto words.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental principle upon which our foreign policy is based is that\r\ntreaties of peace, once signed and ratified, must be carried out, no\r\nmatter whether they are good or bad. A self-respecting nation cannot\r\nfollow another course. Treaties are not eternal or irreparable; they are\r\nchapters and not epilogues in history; to put them into practice means\r\nto try them. If in the course of execution they are proved to be absurd,\r\nthat in itself constitutes the possibility of a further examination of\r\nthe respective positions.\r\n\r\nI shall bring before the consideration of Parliament both the Treaty of\r\nRapallo and the Agreements of Santa Margherita, which are derived from\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAgreed that treaties, when once perfected and ratified, must be loyally\r\ncarried out, I go on to establish another fundamental principle, which\r\nis the rejection of all the famous “reconstructive” ideology. We admit\r\nthat there is a kind of economic union or interdependence among European\r\ncountries. We admit that this economic life must be reconstructed, but\r\nwe refuse to think that the methods hitherto adopted will succeed in\r\ndoing so. Commercial treaties concluded between two Powers—the basis of\r\nthe closest economic relations between nations—are of more value in the\r\nreconstruction of the European economic world than all the complicated\r\nand confused general plenary conferences, whose lamentable history\r\neverybody knows.\r\n\r\nAs far as Italy is concerned, we intend to follow a policy which will be\r\ndignified and at the same time compatible with our national interests.\r\n(Loud applause.) We cannot allow ourselves the luxury of a policy of\r\nfoolish altruism, or of complete surrender to the desires of others. _Do\r\nut des._ For Italy to-day has a new importance which must be reckoned\r\nwith adequately, and this fact is beginning to be recognised beyond her\r\nboundaries. We have not the bad taste to exaggerate our powers, but\r\nneither do we wish to belittle them with excessive and useless modesty.\r\n\r\nMy formula is simple: “Nothing for nothing.” Those who wish to have\r\nconcrete proofs of friendship from us must give us the same. Fascista\r\nItaly, just as she does not intend to repudiate treaties for many\r\nreasons, political, moral and economic, does not intend, either, to\r\nabandon the Allies—Rome is in line with London and Paris; but Italy must\r\nassert herself and impose upon the Allies that strict and courageous\r\nexamination of conscience which has not been faced by them from the time\r\nof the Armistice up to the present day.\r\n\r\nDoes an Entente still exist in the full sense of the word? What is the\r\nposition of the Entente with regard to Germany and Russia? with regard\r\nto an alliance between these two countries? What is the position of\r\nItaly in the Entente, of the Italy who, not solely by reason of the\r\nweakness of her governors, lost strong positions in the Adriatic and the\r\nMediterranean, who did not obtain any colonies or raw materials, who is\r\nliterally crushed under the load of debts incurred in order to obtain\r\nvictory, and whose most sacred rights, even, were held in question? In\r\nthe conversations I intend to have with the Prime Ministers of England\r\nand France, I mean to face clearly and in its entirety the question of\r\nthe Entente and Italy’s position within it.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this, alternatives will arise; either the Entente,\r\nfinding a way of settling her inward perplexities and contradictions,\r\nwill become a really solid homogeneous body, with evenly distributed\r\nforces, with equal rights and equal duties, or her hour will have\r\nstruck, and Italy, regaining her freedom of action, will turn loyally\r\nwith a new policy to the work of safeguarding her interests.\r\n\r\nI hope that the first eventuality will be realised, particularly in view\r\nof the new uprising in the East and the growing intimacy between Russia,\r\nTurkey and Germany. But, however it may be, we must get beyond\r\nconventional phrases. It is time, in fact, to abandon diplomatic\r\nexpedients, which are renewed and repeated at every conference, in order\r\nto deal directly with historical fact, by which alone it is possible to\r\ndecide one way or another the trend of events. Our foreign policy, which\r\naims at protection of our interests, respect of treaties and the\r\nsettling of our position in the Entente, cannot be described as\r\nadventurous and imperialist, in the vulgar sense of the word. We want to\r\nfollow a policy of peace that will not, however, be at the same time\r\nsuicidal.\r\n\r\nIn order to refute the pessimists who expected catastrophic results to\r\nfollow upon the advent of the Fascisti to power, it is enough to remind\r\nthem that our relations with the Swiss are perfectly friendly, and that\r\na commercial treaty, already in the process of formation, will further\r\ncontribute towards strengthening them when it is completed; that they\r\nare perfectly correct as regards Yugoslavia and Greece; we are on good\r\nterms with Spain, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Roumania, and the other\r\nBaltic States, where of late Italy has gained a great deal of sympathy,\r\nand where we are trying to make commercial agreements; and on equally\r\ngood terms with the other States.\r\n\r\nAs far as Austria is concerned, Italy will keep faith as regards her\r\npromises, and will not neglect to enter into economic relations with her\r\nas well as with Hungary and Bulgaria.\r\n\r\nWe maintain, as regards Turkey, that what is now an accomplished fact\r\nought to be recognised as such at Lausanne, with the necessary\r\nguarantees as to trade in the Straits, European interests and the\r\ninterests of the small Christian communities. The situation which has\r\narisen in Islam is going to be carefully watched. When Turkey has got\r\nwhat belongs to her she must not try to obtain more. There will come a\r\nday when it will be necessary to say, “Thus far and no further!” The\r\ndanger of complications in the Balkans, and in consequence in Europe in\r\ngeneral, can be avoided by firmness, which will have an increased effect\r\nin proportion to the loyalty of the Allies’ conduct. We do not forget\r\nthat there are 44,000 Mohammedans in Roumania, 600,000 in Bulgaria,\r\n400,000 in Albania, and 1,500,000 in Yugoslavia; a world which the\r\nrecent victory of the Crescent has exalted, at any rate secretly.\r\n\r\nAs far as Russia is concerned, Italy believes that the moment has come\r\nto face the question of her relations with that country in their actual\r\nreality; but this apart from internal conditions in that country, with\r\nwhich we, as a Government, do not wish to interfere, since in our turn\r\nwe shall admit of no interference in our home affairs. In consequence we\r\nare disposed to consider the possibility of a definite solution of the\r\nsituation. As regards the presence of Russia at Lausanne, Italy has\r\nsupported the most liberal point of view and does not despair of its\r\neventual triumph, although thus far she has only been invited to discuss\r\nthe single question of the Dardanelles.\r\n\r\nOur relations with the United States are very good, and I shall make it\r\nmy care to see that they are improved, especially as regards a close\r\neconomic co-operation. A commercial treaty with Canada is on the point\r\nof being signed. We are on cordial terms with the republics of Central\r\nand South America, and especially with Brazil and the Argentine, where\r\nmillions of Italians live. They must not be denied the possibility of\r\ntaking part in the local political life around them, which will not\r\nestrange them from, but rather bind them all the closer to their Mother\r\nCountry.\r\n\r\nAs for economic and financial problems, Italy will maintain in the\r\napproaching conference at Brussels that debts and reparations form an\r\nindivisible binomial.\r\n\r\nIn order to carry out this policy of dignity and regard for our national\r\ninterests, we need to have at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs a central\r\nstaff competent to deal with the new necessities of the national life\r\nand of the increased prestige of Italy in the world. (Applause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE POLICY OF FASCISMO FOR ITALY: ECONOMY, WORK AND DISCIPLINE\r\n\r\n       Same speech delivered in the Chamber, 16th November 1922.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hon. Mussolini._ Honourable Members,—The policy we shall follow as\r\nregards the country itself can be summed up in three words: economy,\r\nwork and discipline. The financial problem is a fundamental one, the\r\nbalancing of the State Budget must be accomplished as soon as possible\r\nby a régime of careful administration, intelligence in the use of money,\r\nthe utilisation of all the productive forces of the nation and the\r\nremoval of the trappings of war. (Loud applause.) For further\r\ninformation as regards the financial question, which, though serious, is\r\nopen to rapid improvement, I refer you to my colleague Tangorra,[11] who\r\nwill give you information when the financial measures are discussed.\r\n\r\nFootnote 11:\r\n\r\n  Late Minister of Finance.\r\n\r\nHe who talks of work, talks of the productive middle classes in the\r\ntowns and in the country. It is not a question of privileges for the\r\nfirst or for privileges for the second, but of the safeguarding of all\r\nthe interests which are in accordance with national production. The\r\nproletariat which works, and whose well-being concerns us, though not\r\nfrom weak demagogic motives, has nothing to fear, nothing to lose and\r\neverything to gain from a financial policy which preserves the balance\r\nof the State and prevents bankruptcy, which would have a disastrous\r\neffect, especially among the humbler classes.\r\n\r\nOur policy as regards emigration must free itself of an excessive\r\n“paternalism,” while, at the same time, an Italian who emigrates must\r\nknow that his interests will be securely guarded by the representatives\r\nof his country abroad. The growth of the prestige of a nation in the\r\nworld is in proportion to the discipline it shows at home. There is no\r\ndoubt that the internal condition of the country has improved, but it is\r\nnot yet as I should like to see it. I do not intend to indulge myself in\r\neasy optimism. I am no lover of Pangloss. In the big cities, and in all\r\nthe towns in general, there is peace; instances of violence are sporadic\r\nand peripheral; but, at the same time, these also must cease. The\r\ncitizens, no matter to what party they belong, shall have freedom of\r\nmovement; all religions shall be respected, with particular regard to\r\nthe dominant faith, Catholicism; statutory liberty shall not be\r\ninfringed and the law shall be made to be respected at all costs!\r\n\r\nThe State is strong and will prove its power equally where all classes\r\nof citizens are concerned, including illegal Fascismo, because it would\r\nnow be irresponsible illegality and without any justification. I must\r\nadd, however, that almost all the Fascisti have submitted to the new\r\norder of things. The State does not mean to abdicate for anyone, and\r\nwhoever opposes it must be punished. This explicit statement is a\r\nwarning to all citizens, and I know will be particularly pleasing to the\r\nFascisti, who have fought and won in order to have a State which would\r\nmake itself felt in every direction with inexhaustible energy. It must\r\nnot be forgotten that, besides the minority that represent actual\r\nmilitant politics, there are forty millions of excellent Italians who\r\nwork, by their splendid birth-rate perpetuate our race, and who ask, and\r\nhave the right to obtain, freedom from the chronic state of disorder\r\nwhich is the sure prelude to general ruin. Since sermons, evidently, are\r\nnot enough, the State will put the army it has at its disposal in order\r\nby a process of selection and improvement. The Fascista State will form\r\na perfectly organised and united police force, of great mobility and\r\nwith a high moral standard; while the army and navy—glorious and dear to\r\nevery Italian heart—withdrawn from the vicissitudes of Parliamentary\r\npolitics, reorganised and strengthened, will represent the last reserve\r\nof the nation both at home and abroad.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, from the last communication issued you will learn what the\r\nFascista programme is in detail with regard to each individual Ministry.\r\nI do not wish, as long as it is possible to avoid it, to govern against\r\nthe wishes of the Chamber; but the Chamber must understand the peculiar\r\nposition it holds, which makes it liable to dismissal in two days or in\r\ntwo years. (Laughter.) We ask for full powers, because we wish to take\r\nfull responsibility. Without full powers you know perfectly well that\r\nnot a penny—a penny I say—would be saved. By this we do not intend to\r\nexclude the possibility of voluntary co-operation, which we shall\r\ncordially accept, whether it be from deputies, senators or single\r\ncompetent citizens. We have, every one of us, a religious sense of the\r\ndifficulty of our task. The country encourages us and waits. We shall\r\nnot give you further words but facts. Let us solemnly and formally\r\npledge ourselves to balance the Budget, and we shall do it. We wish to\r\nhave a foreign policy of peace, but, at the same time, it must be\r\ndignified and firm; and we shall have it. None of our enemies, past or\r\npresent, need deceive themselves about the rapidity of our advent to\r\npower. (Laughter; comments.) Our Government has a formidable hold upon\r\nthe hearts of the people and is supported by the best elements in the\r\ncountry. There is no doubt that in these last days an enormous step has\r\nbeen taken towards spiritual unity. The Italian nation has found herself\r\nagain, from the north to the south, from the Continent to those generous\r\nislands which shall no more be forgotten—(Applause.)—from Rome to the\r\nindustrious colonies of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic. Gentlemen,\r\ndo not throw useless words at the nation; fifty-two requests to speak on\r\nmy lists is too much. Let us work, rather, with pure hearts and ready\r\nbrains to assure the prosperity and the greatness of the country.\r\n\r\nAnd may God help me to carry my arduous task to a victorious end. (Loud\r\napplause. Many deputies come down to congratulate the President.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n “CONSCIENTIOUS GENERAL DIAGNOSIS OF THE CONDITIONS OF THE COUNTRY AND\r\n                          ITS FOREIGN POLICY”\r\n\r\n                 Sitting of 27th November 1922, Senate.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hon. Mussolini._ Honourable Senators,—I have listened with deep\r\ninterest and attention to all the speeches touching upon various\r\nsubjects which have been delivered in this hall. The Ministers directly\r\nconcerned can answer to the different individual questions. I shall\r\nlimit myself to confuting some of the statements which can be said to be\r\nof a general order. Of course if the vote of the Senate be unanimous, it\r\nwill please me—(Laughter.)—but you must not believe that unanimity\r\nflatters me excessively. I entertain a thorough contempt for those who\r\nhave more or less clamorously sided with me in these last days. They are\r\nso often the kind of people who follow the fair wind and are ready to\r\ntumble headlong over to the other side when the wind changes direction.\r\n(Laughter.) I prefer sincere enemies to doubtful friends.\r\n\r\nOf the speeches delivered in this hall some have a particular\r\nimportance, as for instance that, generally optimistic, of Senator\r\nConti, which reminded me of the analogous speech, also optimistic,\r\ndelivered in the Chamber by the Hon. Buozzi. This favourable view of\r\neconomic conditions in Italy, coming thus from a head of the proletariat\r\nand a head of the great Italian industries, is a curious coincidence and\r\ncertainly of good omen.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Neat Surgical Operation._ I owe a special answer to Senator\r\nAlbertini. I admire his firm faith in pure Liberalism, but I take the\r\nliberty to remind him that Constitutionalism in England, Liberalism in\r\nFrance, in fact all the ideas and doctrines which have in common the\r\nname of Liberalism, spring out of a fierce revolutionary travail without\r\nwhich, to-day, Signor Albertini would not, very probably, have been able\r\nto pay these tributes to pure Liberalism.\r\n\r\nHow was it possible to find a way out of this internal crisis, which\r\nevery day was becoming more alarming and distressing? A temporary and\r\ntransitional Ministry was no longer possible. It did not solve the\r\nproblem, it hardly delayed it. Consequently in two, three or six months’\r\ntime at the most, with that mobility of opinions and desires that\r\ncharacterised certain Parliamentary circles, we should have found\r\nourselves where we were at the beginning, with nothing gained but the\r\nfailure which would have aggravated the crisis. (Hear, hear!)\r\n\r\nAfter having thought over the matter deeply, therefore, and having\r\nclearly realised the ironic paradox, becoming every day more manifest,\r\nof the existence of two States—one the actual State itself and the other\r\nwhich nobody succeeded in defining—I said to myself at a certain moment\r\nthat only a neat surgical operation could make one compact State of the\r\ntwo and save the fortunes of the nation.\r\n\r\nSenator Albertini must not think that this decision was other than the\r\nresult of long meditation; he must not think that I had not well\r\nconsidered all the dangers and risks of this illegal action. I willed it\r\ndeliberately. I dare to say more than this—I forced it on. To my mind\r\nthere was no other way except by revolution to revive a political class\r\ngrown enormously tired and discouraged in all its sections; and since\r\nexperience teaches something, or ought to teach something, to\r\nintelligent men, I at once set limits and established rules for my\r\naction. I have not gone beyond a certain point, I did not in the least\r\nbecome intoxicated by victory, nor did I take advantage of it. Who could\r\nhave prevented me from closing Parliament? Who could have prevented me\r\nfrom proclaiming a Dictatorship with two or three men? Who could\r\nwithstand me? Who could have withstood a movement which consisted not\r\nonly in 300,000 membership cards but in 300,000 rifles? Nobody. It was I\r\nwho, for love of our country, said that it was necessary to subordinate\r\nimpulse, sentiment and personal ambition to the supreme interests of the\r\nnation; and it was I who put the movement at once on constitutional\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nI have formed a Ministry with men from all parties in the House. I did\r\nnot hesitate to include a member of the old Cabinet. I gave importance\r\nto technical efficiency and paid no attention to political labels. I\r\nformed a Coalition Ministry and I presented it to the Chamber. I asked\r\nfor its judgment and its vote and I found that Chamber a little changed.\r\nBut when I found out that not less than thirty-three orators had\r\npresented thirty-six orders of the day, I said to myself that perhaps it\r\nwas not necessary to abolish Parliament, but that the country would be\r\nglad to see it enjoying a holiday for a certain period. (Laughter.) I\r\nhave, therefore, no intention of dismissing the Chamber, of destroying\r\nall the fruits of the Liberal revolution. I can boast of all this\r\nphilosophically from a point of view which might almost be called\r\nnegative. But philosophy must be silent in the face of political\r\nnecessity. Let us speak frankly! What is this Liberalism, this\r\nLiberalism put into practice? Because if there is anyone who believes\r\nthat, to be a true Liberal, it is necessary to give some hundreds of\r\nirresponsible people, fanatics and scoundrels, the power of ruining\r\nforty millions of Italians, I refuse absolutely to give them this power.\r\n(Applause.) Gentlemen, I have no fetishes, and where the interests of\r\nthe country are concerned the Government has the right to intervene. If\r\nit did not do so, it would be inadequate the first time and the next\r\ntime suicidal.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Respect for the Constitution._ I do not intend to deviate from the\r\nConstitution or to improvise. The example of other revolutions has shown\r\nme that there are some fundamental principles in the life of the people\r\nthat must be respected. (Hear, hear!) I do not intend that national\r\ndiscipline shall be any longer merely a word. I do not intend that the\r\nlaw shall be any longer a blunt weapon. (Hear, hear!) I do not intend\r\nthat liberty shall degenerate into licence. I do not intend, either, to\r\nremain above the fray among those who love, who work for, and who are\r\nready to sacrifice themselves for the nation, or, on the other hand,\r\namong those who are ready to do the reverse.\r\n\r\nIt was for just such a foolish “Rolandism” that this last Government\r\nfailed. One cannot remain above the fray when the moral forces which are\r\nthe foundation of the national community are at stake; and nobody can\r\nsay that a national policy, understood thus, is reactionary. For me all\r\nthese names of Left and Right, of Conservative, Aristocracy and\r\nDemocracy are so many empty academic terms. They serve occasionally to\r\ndistinguish, but more often to confuse.\r\n\r\nI shall not follow an anti-proletariat policy, for reasons national, and\r\nother than national. We do not want to oppress the proletariat; we do\r\nnot want to drive it back into humiliating conditions of life. On the\r\ncontrary we want to elevate it materially and spiritually; but not\r\nbecause we think that the masses, the populace, could create a special\r\ntype of civilisation in the future. Let us leave this kind of ideology\r\nto those who profess themselves to be ministers of this mysterious\r\nreligion. The reasons for which we wish to follow a policy of\r\nproletarian welfare are quite different. They lie in the interests of\r\nthe nation; they are dictated by the reality of facts, by the conviction\r\nthat no nation can be united and at peace if twenty millions of workmen\r\nare condemned to live in humiliating and inadequate conditions of life.\r\nAnd it may be, nay, it is certain, that our labour policy—or rather\r\nanti-demagogic policy, because we cannot promise the paradise we do not\r\npossess—will ultimately prove to be much more useful to those same\r\nworking classes than the other policy which, like an oriental mirage,\r\nhas hypnotised and mystified them into a vain attitude of waiting.\r\n(Approval.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Military Organisation of Fascismo._ “What will you do with the\r\nmilitary organisation of Fascismo?” I have been asked. This military\r\norganisation gave Rome an imposing spectacle. There were 52,000 “black\r\nshirts,” and they left Rome within the twenty-four hours prescribed by\r\nme. They obey. I dare even to go further and to say that they have the\r\nmysticism of obedience! I do not intend to disperse these exuberant\r\nforces, not only for the sake of Fascismo itself, but in the interests\r\nof the nation. What I shall impose upon Fascismo is the discontinuance\r\nof all the acts for which there is now no necessity—(Hear, hear!)—those\r\nsmall, individual and collective acts of violence which are rather\r\nhumiliating to everyone, which are often the result of local situations\r\nand could with difficulty be associated with the big problems of the\r\ndifferent Italian parties. I am sure that what might be called “illegal\r\nFascismo,” now happily on the decline, will soon end altogether. This is\r\none of the conditions of that pacification to which my friend Senator\r\nBellini alluded; but in order that this pacification may succeed, the\r\nother side must also cease their ambushes and acts of violence.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Foreign Policy._ I thank the Senate for not having dwelt too much on\r\nforeign policy. I am particularly glad that Fascismo has universally\r\naccepted with enthusiasm my firm decision as regards the application of\r\ntreaties, because if I do not allow illegality in internal policy, still\r\nless shall I allow it in foreign affairs. (Hear, hear!) So let it be\r\nclear to all inside this hall and out. Foreign policy will be in the\r\nhands of one man alone, of the man who has the honour of representing\r\nand directing it; because there cannot be an unlimited division and\r\ndiffusion of responsibility, and foreign policy is too difficult and\r\ndelicate a matter to be thrown as occupation to those who have nothing\r\nbetter to do. (Laughter.)\r\n\r\nI can then tell the Hon. Barzilai that I shall keep the Ministry for\r\nForeign Affairs for myself. At bottom the Ministry of the Interior is a\r\nMinistry of Police, and I am glad to be the head of the police. I am not\r\nin the least ashamed of it. On the contrary, I hope that all Italian\r\ncitizens, forgetting certain atavisms, will recognise in the police one\r\nof the most necessary forces for the welfare of our social existence.\r\nBut, above all, I intend to follow a line of foreign policy which will\r\nnot be adventurous, while, at the same time, it will not be\r\ncharacterised by self-sacrifice. (Strong approval.) Certainly miracles\r\nare not to be expected in this field, as it is impossible to cancel in a\r\nconversation, even in a dramatic one of half an hour, a policy which has\r\nbeen the result of other conditions and of another period of time.\r\n\r\nI think that foreign policy should have as its supreme aim the\r\nmaintenance of peace. This is a fine ideal, especially after a war that\r\nhas lasted four years. Our policy, therefore, will not be that of the\r\nImperialists who seek the impossible, while, at the same time, it will\r\nnot necessarily rest upon the negative formula according to which one\r\nshould never have recourse to force. It is well to keep the possibility\r\nof war in sight; it cannot be discarded _a priori_, because in that case\r\nwe should find ourselves disarmed with the other nations in arms. (Great\r\napplause.)\r\n\r\nBut I have no illusions, for, in accordance with my temperament, I\r\ndisdain all easy optimism. People who see things through rose-coloured\r\nspectacles make me laugh; I often pity them. I think, however, I have\r\nalready succeeded in something, and in no small thing either, which will\r\nhave no small results. That is to say, I think I have succeeded in\r\nmaking the Allies and other peoples of Europe, who had not yet attained\r\na true vision of Italy, see her as she really is. Not as something\r\nvaguely prehistoric, not the Italy of monuments and libraries—all most\r\nrespectable things—but Italy as I see her born under my eyes, the Italy\r\nof to-day, overflowing with vitality, prepared to give herself a new\r\nlease of life, pregnant with serenity and beauty; an Italy which does\r\nnot live like a parasite on the past, but is prepared to build up her\r\nown future with her own forces and through her own work and martyrdom.\r\n\r\nThis is the Italy which has now flashed, be it ever so vaguely, before\r\nthe eyes of the representatives of other nations, who henceforward must\r\nbe convinced, whether they wish it or not, that Italy does not intend to\r\nfollow in the wake of others, but intends to vindicate her rights with\r\ndignity, and with no less dignity to protect her interests. (Approval.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_God and the People._ I have been admonished in turn by all those who\r\nhave spoken in this hall. They have said to me: “The responsibility\r\nwhich you take is enormously heavy.” Yes! I know it and I feel it.\r\nSometimes, intensified by a deep and vibrating expectancy, it almost\r\ncrushes me. At these times I have to gather all my force, to arm myself\r\nwith all my determination, in order to keep before me the interests and\r\nthe future of our country. Well I know that it is not my interests that\r\nare at stake. Certainly, if I do not succeed I am a broken man. These\r\nare not experiments that can be tried twice in a lifetime. But my person\r\nis of little value. Not to succeed would not mean much to me personally,\r\nbut it would be infinitely serious for the nation. (Hear, hear!) I\r\nintend to take the helm of the ship, and I do not intend to yield it to\r\nanybody. But I shall not refuse to take on board all those who wish to\r\nform my crew, all those who wish to work with me, who will give me\r\nadvice and suggestions, who will, in a word, give me their invaluable\r\nand indispensable co-operation.\r\n\r\nIn the other Chamber I invoked the help of God. In this—and I hope my\r\nwords will not be taken as mere rhetoric—I shall invoke the Italian\r\npeople. In doing this I might feel that I was walking in the steps of\r\nMazzini, who made a union between God and the people. But if, as I hope\r\nand earnestly desire, the people will be disciplined, laborious, and\r\nproud of this their glorious country, I feel I shall not fail to arrive\r\nat my goal! (Ovation; the Ministers and many Senators advance to\r\ncongratulate the orator.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    “I REMAIN THE HEAD OF FASCISMO, ALTHOUGH THE HEAD OF THE ITALIAN\r\n                              GOVERNMENT”\r\n\r\n  Speech delivered in London, 12th December 1922, before the Fascisti.\r\n\r\n\r\nFascisti! You must feel that in this last month the Italian people have\r\nraised themselves considerably in the eyes of all the other nations.\r\nEverybody knows now that a new and vigorous Italy was born in those\r\nhistoric days of October. Remember that the revolution was great, but\r\nthat it is not over, indeed that it has hardly begun. Hard tasks and\r\nheavy responsibilities await us. I remain the head of Fascismo, although\r\nthe head of the Government. Beneath these official clothes, which I wear\r\nas a duty, I shall keep the Fascista uniform, just as I wore it before\r\nHis Majesty when he summoned me to form a new Cabinet.\r\n\r\nFascista Italy, I assure you, is in very strong hands. All our enemies\r\nknow that every attempt at revolt will be inexorably crushed. The old\r\nItaly is dead and will not come to life again. The men who gave their\r\nlives in the war will prevent it; those who fell in the Fascista war, no\r\nless sacred and necessary, will prevent it; the living will prevent it.\r\nWe, here and everywhere, are ready for any battle so that we may uphold\r\nthe foundations of our race and of our history. The time has come to\r\nface serenely the sons of other nations. The era of renunciations and\r\nobligations is past; the head of the Government tells you this. You\r\nasked me to come here upon this occasion of the inauguration of the\r\nLondon section of the Fascista Party. I present you with your banner;\r\nkeep it as you keep alive the flame of that faith for which so many fine\r\nyoung men have died, keep it for the fortunes of Italy and Fascismo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n “OUR TASK IN HISTORY IS TO MAKE A UNITED STATE OF THE ITALIAN NATION”\r\n\r\n  Speech delivered 2nd January 1923, upon the occasion of the\r\n  Ministerial Reception in Palazzo Chigi at Rome, in answer to the\r\n  Hon. Teofilo Rossi, Minister of Industry and Commerce, who had\r\n  concluded his address to the President by saying: “The victorious\r\n  Greeks returning from Troy through the storm cried: ‘Nil desperandum\r\n  Teucro duce et auspice Teucro.’ We in our turn will say: ‘_Nil\r\n  desperandum_ while at the helm of the State there is a man like\r\n  Benito Mussolini.’”\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Colleagues,—Let me first of all say how happy I am that we should\r\nhave met in these magnificent rooms which furnish evidence of the\r\nstrength and beauty of our race, and are also a testimony of our\r\nvictory, as, if I am not mistaken, these were the apartments of an\r\nenemy’s Embassy.[12]\r\n\r\nFootnote 12:\r\n\r\n  Palazzo Chigi, at present Ministry for Foreign Affairs, formerly was\r\n  the seat of the Austrian Embassy to the Quirinal.\r\n\r\nI was very much touched by the words spoken just now by our colleague\r\nRossi. The nation as a whole is not deceived, and follows with brotherly\r\nsympathy the work of our Government. It is aware of the difficulties we\r\nhave to overcome: difficulties which arise from the double work of\r\ndemolition and reconstruction which we have undertaken simultaneously.\r\nThe nation, little by little, is being restored to order. There are more\r\nthan ten thousand communes in Italy, and there is no reason to fear a\r\ncatastrophe because there is a quarrel, without any particular positive\r\nimportance, in one of them during the critical days of Saturday and\r\nSunday.\r\n\r\nAll this does preoccupy me, however, and I intend by every means\r\npossible to get the nation back into a state of general discipline that\r\nwill be above all sects, factions and parties.\r\n\r\nThere was an Italian people who had not yet become a nation; the travail\r\nof fifty years of history and, above all, the last war has made them a\r\nnation. The task in history which awaits us is this: to make a State of\r\nthis nation, that is to say, a moral idea which is personified and\r\nexpressed in a system of individual, responsible hierarchies composed of\r\nmen who, from the first to the last, feel it a pride and a privilege to\r\nfulfil their duty.\r\n\r\nThis work, seen from the standpoint of historical development, cannot be\r\ncompleted in two months and probably not even in two years. But this is\r\nthe direction in which our Government is working, and every decision we\r\nmake and every act we achieve is guided by the necessity of establishing\r\none united State, which will be the only depositary of our history and\r\nof the future and the strength of the Italian nation.\r\n\r\nIt is a difficult and arduous undertaking. But life would not be worth\r\nliving if we did not face these tasks, and if we had not the\r\nsatisfaction of having met them all the more serenely for their\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nNo! I am certain that we shall not frustrate the legitimate hopes of the\r\nItalian people. We can and we will adopt a policy of wisdom and severity\r\ntowards the people and towards ourselves. We must foster the ideals of\r\nthe nation, and deal relentlessly with the slightest manifestation of\r\nlack of discipline.\r\n\r\nI, too, should like to quote from the tales of ancient Greece. When the\r\nSpartan mothers presented their departing sons with their shields, it\r\nwas with these words: “Either with this or on it.” Now I should like our\r\nprogramme to be inspired by this idea, for with this programme, and with\r\nthis only, shall we win.\r\n\r\nThrough our efforts, our work and our suffering will rise that powerful,\r\nprosperous and peaceful Italy of which we dream, which we long for and\r\ndesire to see! Long live Italy!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE ADVANCE IN THE RUHR DISTRICT\r\n\r\n Speech delivered at Rome, 15th January 1923, before the members of the\r\n                                Cabinet.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Prime Minister._ Honourable Colleagues,—The most important event of\r\nthese last few days in the international world has been the French\r\nadvance on the Ruhr. It is well to establish clearly the attitude of\r\nItaly with regard to this advance, since, for political reasons and also\r\nfor reasons connected with the Stock Exchange, it has purposely not been\r\nproperly estimated.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to go back to the Conference of Paris, and the rejection\r\nof Bonar Law’s proposals on the part of Italy, France and Belgium, in\r\norder to understand the line of conduct adopted by the Italian\r\nGovernment. It is a fact that each one of the Powers in the Entente has\r\ntaken up an attitude of its own, due to its own particular conditions.\r\nWithout taking into consideration the Americans, who have withdrawn\r\ntheir troops from the Rhine, this is the position of the Powers.\r\n\r\nEngland has not joined with France, but has not decided, at any rate up\r\nto the present, to recall her troops from German soil, nor has she\r\nchanged in her friendly attitude towards France, as was set forth by the\r\nmost recent communications from the Foreign Office.\r\n\r\nFrance, interested in the problem of reparations, has, upon the basis of\r\nthe deliberations of the Commission appointed to enquire into this\r\nquestion, sent into the Ruhr a Board of Control for the production of\r\ncoal and, later, troops for the purpose of protection.\r\n\r\nBelgium has afforded France some military co-operation and undivided\r\npolitical support.\r\n\r\nItaly has only given political and technical support, sending her\r\nengineers to the Ruhr. Our country could not isolate herself without\r\ncommitting a very grave mistake. She could not exclude herself entirely\r\nfrom any operation of control taking place in a region of coalfields,\r\nand, therefore, of fundamental importance in European and Italian\r\neconomics.\r\n\r\nAs regards the project for a continental alliance directed against\r\nEngland, such an idea simply does not exist. The Italian Government\r\nnever suggested such a thing, and, in any case, would never have been\r\nable to consider the possibility of a continental union against England,\r\nboth on account of her importance in the economic life of the Continent\r\nand of existing relations between Italy and that country.\r\n\r\nIt is true, on the contrary, that the Italian Government had advised\r\nFrance to limit, as far as possible, the military character of the\r\nadvance in the Ruhr district, and not to reject all possibilities of\r\nagreement in this burning question. But if this understanding, which\r\nwould give peace to Europe, were to be realised, it is the opinion of\r\nItaly that it could not come about without the co-operation of England.\r\nItaly, which has no coal, cannot afford the luxury of renunciations and\r\nisolation, but it is as well to make it clear—because it is the\r\ntruth—that Italian policy upon this occasion, as upon all others, is\r\ninspired by considerations of a general nature, as decided in the\r\nMemorandum of London, for the protection of Italian interests and of\r\nEuropean economics generally. The Italian Government thinks that if\r\nthere is a possibility of agreement—and it works in this direction—it\r\nwould be a grave mistake on the part of Germany to refuse it.\r\n\r\nIt seems as if a _détente_ between the French command and some of the\r\nindustrial magnates of the Ruhr district has already taken place. As for\r\nthe mass of the workmen, it appears as if they do not intend to put\r\ninsuperable difficulties in the way of the work of control.\r\n\r\nThe payment of the quota for the 15th January is postponed until the end\r\nof the month. There are, therefore, fifteen days of useful time,\r\nsufficient to mend the situation. It does not seem improbable that the\r\nFrench will support the Italian project presented at London upon the\r\nsubject of reparations.\r\n\r\nAs for the attitude of the Soviet Government, it appears to be very\r\ncircumspect, and has not changed from that previously manifested, though\r\nonly in words, towards the German proletariat.\r\n\r\nFrom Lausanne comes satisfactory news. I have the pleasure of announcing\r\nthat, in some of the very delicate questions which seemed to be leading\r\nto a rupture, such as that of minorities, if an agreement has been\r\nreached, it has been due to the wise and level-headed work of the\r\nItalian Delegation.\r\n\r\n(Without discussion, the declarations of the Prime Minister are\r\nunanimously approved.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Great Fascista Council._ My colleagues in the Cabinet will\r\ncertainly have read with attention the deliberations of the Great\r\nNational Council of the Fascisti, and have noticed the importance of\r\ntheir character.\r\n\r\nIt is an essentially political organisation, which, however, does not\r\nencroach in any way upon the sphere of action of the Government,\r\nrepresented by the Cabinet. In fact none of the legislative measures\r\npassed or to be passed by the Cabinet were made the subject of\r\ndiscussion by the Fascista Council. All its decisions are of a purely\r\npolitical nature. Thus they have definitely settled the character of the\r\nnational militia. They have constituted the organisation which is to\r\nestablish relations between Fascisti and Nationalists, as well as those\r\nbetween Fascismo and the other parties which loyally co-operate with the\r\nGovernment and the organisations of employers already in existence\r\nbefore the formation of the analogous Fascista groups.\r\n\r\nImportant also is the vote by which the associations of ex-soldiers\r\n(including the disabled) who have entered the sphere of the State have\r\nbeen asked to give men for the purposes of administration. The\r\ndeclaration of loyal devotion to the Monarchy is both magnificent and\r\nsolemn, and dispels every little misunderstanding of interested dabblers\r\nin politics on that score, for whom the warning that closed the\r\nproceedings of the Great Council came opportunely—the warning, that is\r\nto say, that the Government—note, the Government—will inexorably crush\r\nevery attempt at direct or indirect opposition to its authority.\r\n\r\nThe Great Fascista Council has also sent messages to the working people\r\nof Italy, who are in the process of re-establishing active discipline\r\namongst themselves, and who accept the provisions of the Government,\r\neven the hardest, because they are sure that they are inspired by purely\r\nnational necessity.\r\n\r\nThus the essentially historic function of the Great Fascista Council at\r\nthis moment is clearly outlined. The Council will support and safeguard\r\nthe action of the Government, and perform in the party and in the nation\r\nthe work of general political orientation which must serve as a base for\r\nthe work of the Government itself. (The Council of Ministers approves\r\nthe declarations of the Prime Minister.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE GOVERNMENT OF SPEED\r\n\r\n Speech delivered at Rome, 19th January 1923, at the headquarters of the\r\n                         Motor Transport Company.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hon. Mussolini._ I warmly thank Commendatore De Cupis and all the\r\nworkmen—I was going to say my colleagues—for the warm welcome I have\r\nreceived. If my minutes were not numbered, I should like, here in the\r\npresence of the “controllers of the steering wheel,” to sing the praises\r\nof speed, in this the epoch of speed. The times in which we live no\r\nlonger allow of a sedentary egoistical life; everything must be on the\r\ngo, everybody must raise the standard of his activity, both in the\r\noffices and in the factories where the work is done—(Applause.)—and the\r\nGovernment, which I have the honour to represent, is the Government of\r\nspeed, that is to say, we get rid of all that is stagnant in our\r\nnational life.\r\n\r\nFormerly the bureaucracy dozed over deferred decisions, to-day it must\r\nproceed with the maximum of rapidity. (Applause.) If we all go ahead\r\nwith this energy, good-will and cheerfulness we shall surmount the\r\ncrisis, which for that matter is already partly overcome.\r\n\r\nI am pleased to see that Rome also is waking up and can offer us sights\r\nsuch as these works. I maintain that Rome can become an industrial\r\ncentre. The Romans must be the first to disdain to live solely upon\r\ntheir memories. The Coliseum and the Forum are glories of the past, but\r\nwe must build up the glories of to-day and of to-morrow. We belong to\r\nthe generation of builders who, by work and discipline, with hands and\r\nbrains, desire to reach the ultimate and longed-for goal, the greatness\r\nof the future nation, which will be a nation of producers and not of\r\nparasites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         THE MARCH OF EVENTS ON THE RUHR THE POSITION OF ITALY\r\n\r\n    Speech delivered at Rome, 23rd January 1923, before the Cabinet.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Prime Minister._ Honourable Colleagues,—Since the last meeting of\r\nthe Cabinet, the situation on the Ruhr has become more complicated, and\r\nthis also from the social point of view, as the result of the closing\r\ndown of the factories and the outbreak of strikes in the mines and\r\npublic services of the occupied zones.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the attitudes of the different Powers and the\r\nfact that these attitudes have not undergone any changes worthy of note,\r\nit is necessary to summarise briefly the events of these last few days\r\nof high tension, political and economic.\r\n\r\nThe period of time granted for the Moratorium having elapsed on 15th\r\nJanuary, France and Belgium have caused a Mission of Control to be sent\r\nto the mines in the Ruhr district, escorted by protecting troops, and\r\nhave extended the area of territory occupied in the Ruhr district as far\r\nas Dortmund. On 16th January the French Government gave notice that the\r\nindustrial magnates on the Ruhr had declared that they had received\r\norders from the German Government not to hand over any more coal. The\r\nGerman Minister for Foreign Affairs himself communicated these\r\ninstructions to our Ambassador at Berlin.\r\n\r\nFrance and Belgium were not, therefore, receiving any more coal, even\r\nwhen payment was made in advance. In the face of the German resistance,\r\nthe French and Belgian troops have proceeded to requisition the coal\r\ndeposits at the pitheads, the factories and the railway stations, and\r\nhave also taken other serious steps of a political and military order.\r\nItalian experts, sent only to take part in economic operations of\r\ncontrol, received orders to limit their co-operation to that which\r\nconcerned coercive measures of a political nature.\r\n\r\nSuch an attitude was clearly faced and decided in Paris. On the strength\r\nof the decision made on 26th December by the Commission of Reparations,\r\nwhich reported the failure of Germany, as regards Italy also, to supply\r\nwood, France and Belgium decided to proceed to the exploitation of the\r\nCrown and Communal forests in the Rhine territory. Germany had, besides,\r\nmade it known that coal supplies and cattle would be refused to France\r\nand Belgium, by way both of reparation and restitution.\r\n\r\nThe Commission of Reparations in its decision of 16th January verified\r\nthis intentional failure on the part of Germany from the 12th January,\r\nand notified it to the Government. As a result of this, France and\r\nBelgium decided to take possession of the west customs frontier of\r\nGermany in the occupied zone. The Italian Government took over control\r\nof the customs and also of the forests, this being included among the\r\nmeasures which the Italian Memorandum had reserved as a security in the\r\ncase of the concession of the Moratorium; but it asked the French\r\nGovernment what was going to be the extent to which the action was to be\r\ncarried. The French Government replied that the occupation of the Ruhr\r\nwas not of a military character, but was for the protection of French\r\ntechnical bodies, which were very numerous in the occupied area. The\r\nItalian Delegate, who was already on the High Commission of the Rhine,\r\nwhich directs the exploitation and also the control of the mines, has\r\nreceived orders to take part in those deliberations which have an\r\neconomic and financial character, and to abstain from attending those\r\nwhich are political.\r\n\r\nAs I said before, the attitudes of the Great Powers have not altered to\r\nany great extent. England seems officially uninterested in what happens\r\non the Ruhr, but this has not prevented the English Representative on\r\nthe Rhine High Commission from declaring in the name of his Government\r\nthat he will be present at the deliberations, abstaining from recording\r\nhis vote when he thinks it best; but he adds, also, that his Government\r\nwill not oppose the carrying out of the provisions in the zone occupied\r\nby the English troops which still remain on the Rhine. As you see, it is\r\nnot England’s intention to accentuate the difference between her policy\r\nand that which is, at present, adopted by France.\r\n\r\nMediation on the part of Italy was spoken of, which might have led later\r\nto a direct Anglo-Italian intervention, both at Berlin and Paris. An\r\noffer of real mediation does not exist, and could not be made without\r\nthe certainty that it would be accepted with a certain favour. It would\r\nbe a grave mistake to expose Italian policy to a failure of this sort.\r\nIt is a fact that the Italian Government did warn the Germans of the\r\ndanger of the blind-alley situation in which she has voluntarily placed\r\nherself, and in which she seems determined to stay. She also called the\r\nattention of France, in a friendly manner, to the complications, not\r\nonly economic but also political and social, which might arise from the\r\noccupation of the Ruhr.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Work of the Italian Government._ Matters standing thus, the Italian\r\nGovernment cannot at present change its attitude, because no step it\r\ntook now would alter the general situation or exercise a preponderating\r\ninfluence in the decisions of the Governments most involved. The opinion\r\nof the Italian Government is that the situation on the Ruhr has not yet\r\nreached the stage at which a solution must necessarily be found, and\r\nonly when that moment arrives will it be able, perhaps, to have an\r\ninfluence on the situation itself.\r\n\r\nAs for the Moratorium which President Poincaré has decided to propose to\r\nthe Germans, in view of the fast approaching date of payment, 31st\r\nJanuary, it is worthy of note that it will include some of the points\r\nmade in the Italian Memorandum of London, namely the two years’\r\nMoratorium and the German internal loan.\r\n\r\nAs far as America is concerned, having once withdrawn her troops from\r\nthe Rhine, she has not altered her policy of neutral inactivity.\r\n\r\nOne understands that the events in the Ruhr district have caused a\r\ngeneral uneasiness over the whole of Europe, especially in the countries\r\nwhich form the Little Entente. Rumours which spoke of mobilisation and\r\nthe concentration of troops upon some of the frontiers have proved\r\nunfounded and exaggerated. As regards Russia, beyond reports of certain\r\npolitical activities on the part of the Third International, carried on\r\nwith a view to taking advantage socially of the events on the Ruhr,\r\nthere is no definite news of serious preparations for military\r\nintervention on a large scale. At Lausanne, the reaction of the\r\nsituation on the Ruhr is being felt, and is arousing an increased\r\nintransigence on the part of Turkey.\r\n\r\nTo sum up: The policy of Italy must be inspired first of all by the\r\ndefence of her own interests, though, at the same time, due note must be\r\ntaken of considerations and needs of a general order. It is a question\r\nwhether, by a more exact valuation of the conditions put forward in the\r\nItalian Memorandum of London, the grave complications which exist to-day\r\nwould not have been avoided. At any rate the Italian Government will\r\ntake careful and speedy measures to avoid any further difficulties and\r\nre-establish as soon as possible a release of tension throughout Europe,\r\nwhich might make it possible to face the problem of reparations and\r\ndebts under other conditions.\r\n\r\n(The Cabinet at the end express entire approval of the line of foreign\r\npolicy adopted by the Prime Minister.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       THE RUHR, THE CONFERENCE OF LAUSANNE AND THE PORT OF MEMEL\r\n\r\n    Speech delivered at Rome, 1st February 1923, before the Cabinet.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Prime Minister._ With reference to foreign affairs, the situation,\r\nas far as Italy is concerned, cannot be said to have altered much in the\r\ninterval which has elapsed between the last Cabinet meeting and to-day.\r\n\r\nThe German resistance on economic grounds has provoked aggravation of\r\nthe measures—both military and political—which are being taken by France\r\nand Belgium, but from which Italy, following her previous line of\r\nconduct, has kept apart.\r\n\r\nThe complications which were—or could have been—feared, so far have not\r\noccurred. Fresh factors have not entered into the close duel which is\r\nbeing fought on the Ruhr. Russia has not altered her attitude as a\r\nState, although the dominating party continues to give clamorous verbal\r\ndemonstrations of solidarity with the German proletariat.\r\n\r\nThe serious disquietude which had been manifested by the Powers of the\r\nLittle Entente is diminishing. There had been rumours—more or less\r\nwithout foundation and spread, perhaps, with the object of producing\r\ncomplications—of plans for repeating in Hungary what France had done on\r\nthe Ruhr, which were attributed to one State or another. These have\r\ngiven Italy the opportunity of confirming and clearly establishing her\r\nattitude of opposition to any movement which could extend the conflict\r\nto other zones or give the opportunity of attacking the validity of the\r\ntreaties of peace already concluded.\r\n\r\nThe Italian Government has been and is following attentively the coal\r\nsituation on the Ruhr, above all as regards its reaction on other\r\nevents. I can say that all internal measures, reduction of the train\r\nservices, including those from abroad, and contracts for fresh supplies,\r\nhave been quickly and diligently carried through, because, whatever may\r\nhappen, no paralysis of our industrial activity or of our communications\r\nmust result. In connection with the supplies of raw materials, I have\r\nthe pleasure to announce to the Cabinet that the Italian Government has\r\nsucceeded in concluding a favourable agreement with the Polish\r\nGovernment for oil.\r\n\r\nAs I said last time, the events on the Ruhr have had the most serious\r\nconsequences in the developments at the Conference of Lausanne, which\r\nhas now arrived at its last stage. The Italian Delegation has carried\r\nout successful work there with the object of obtaining peace in the\r\nEast.\r\n\r\nThe Italian Government has not been among the last to recognise the\r\nlegitimate rights of Turkey, and thinks to-day that it would not be in\r\nher interests to entrench herself in a position of absolute\r\nintransigence. It may be that Turkey has not realised the extensive\r\nprogramme that was laid down by the Grand National Assembly of Angora,\r\nbut it cannot be denied that a great part of that programme has been put\r\ninto execution, since the Turks from Angora have returned not only to\r\nSmyrna but to Constantinople and Adrianople, and have got their way, it\r\ncan be said, in questions of the highest importance, such as that of the\r\ndomination of the Straits and that of Capitulations.\r\n\r\nTaken as a whole, although the general situation continues to be very\r\ncritical, there seems to be a small ray of light upon the horizon. The\r\naction of the Italian Government is directed decidedly towards a policy\r\nof general peace.\r\n\r\nAs regards the question of Memel, the Italian Government has pursued a\r\ntemperate policy, inspired by principles of equity and justice. It is\r\nnot possible to do less than recognise the rights of Lithuania over that\r\nport, but the Lithuanian Government cannot be allowed to substitute\r\nitself for the Allied Powers in deciding its fate.\r\n\r\nWe, then, have remained in an attitude of solidarity with the Allies in\r\nthe measures taken for facing the situation there. But we have, on the\r\nother hand, tried effectively to reduce those measures to the necessary\r\nminimum, avoiding those of such a nature as to provoke further\r\ncomplications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       RATIFICATION OF THE WASHINGTON TREATY OF NAVAL DISARMAMENT\r\n\r\n           Chamber of Deputies. Sitting of 6th February 1923.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Prime Minister._ Honourable Members,—I do not think that it is\r\nworth while losing time in a general discussion upon the qualities of\r\nmen, good and bad, and upon the question as to whether the war of 1914\r\nwill be the last or the one before the last. That would be perfectly\r\nidle and would only lead to academic discussions. Let us, instead, turn\r\nour attention more practically to the Project of Law which I have\r\npresented.\r\n\r\nThe Convention of Washington was closed a year ago. Now the delay in the\r\nratification of the treaty on the part of Italy has already had\r\nambiguous and, I should almost say, unfavourable consequences in the\r\ninternational world. It will be a good thing, then, to proceed at once\r\nto complete this act.\r\n\r\nThe Conference at Washington shared the fate of all the conferences. It\r\nopened with great hopes, flashing before our eyes the possibility of\r\neternal peace. Then the concrete results frustrated these hopes. I\r\nconfess that I do not believe in perpetual and universal peace. In the\r\nlife of the peoples, notwithstanding ideals—noble and worthy of\r\nrespect—there exist the permanent factors of race, and the greatness and\r\ndecadence of nations, which lead to differences often only settled by a\r\nrecourse to arms. Now it is not a case of weighing these conventions\r\nwith a view to peace; they represent a breath, a pause, and it is\r\nuseless to enquire if they have been laid down for idealistic or for\r\nbusiness reasons. In any case I declare that Italy did well to adhere to\r\nthis Convention. If she had not done so, we should have appeared in the\r\neyes of the world as Imperialists and jingoists, which is far from what\r\nwe have in our hearts and minds. The fact that the Government asks the\r\nChamber for this ratification gives an idea of the general trend of the\r\nFascista foreign policy. (Applause.)\r\n\r\n(The ratification of the Treaty is approved of without discussion, only\r\nthe Communists being against it.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  MESSAGE FROM THE HON. MUSSOLINI TO THE ITALIANS IN AMERICA UPON THE\r\n   OCCASION OF THE SIGNING OF THE CONVENTION FOR THE LAYING OF CABLES\r\n                BETWEEN ITALY AND THE AMERICAN CONTINENT\r\n\r\nThe National Government, which has worked indefatigably for three months\r\nto set the country going upon the path to better fortunes, has in these\r\ndays signed the Convention for the laying of cables which are to put our\r\ncountry into communication with you, who represent it in the numerous,\r\nrich and patriotic colonies beyond the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThe enthusiasm for this work, so necessary to our life as a great\r\nnation, seemed at one time to have died down, but to-day with the rise\r\nof youth upon the scenes of Italian politics, that which it seemed would\r\nbe relegated to some remote future has been transformed into a concrete\r\nand almost immediate reality. It is not you, who suffer almost more than\r\nany the pangs of homesickness for our adored country, who need to be\r\nshown the usefulness and necessity of this undertaking, which will be\r\ncarried through in the shortest space of time possible. It will render\r\nfrequent, daily and, above all, free the communications between the\r\nforty million Italians who live in our beautiful peninsula and the six\r\nmillions who live beyond the ocean. All the Italians who can give\r\nfinancial and moral support must co-operate so that the undertaking may\r\nsucceed. The Italian Government does not appeal in vain to its emigrant\r\ncitizens, because it knows that distance makes the love of their country\r\nstronger and more intense.\r\n\r\nThe cables, which in two or three years will bind together Italy and the\r\nAmericas across the boundless ocean, are like a gigantic arm which the\r\ncountry stretches out to her distant sons to draw them to her and to\r\nmake them share more intimately her griefs and her joys, her work, her\r\ngreatness and her glory.\r\n\r\n                                                              MUSSOLINI.\r\n\r\n  ROME, _6th February 1923_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             FOR THE CARRYING OUT OF THE TREATY OF RAPALLO\r\n\r\n   Prefatory remarks to the Deputies, 8th February 1923, accompanying\r\n    the Project of Law presented by the Hon. Mussolini, Minister for\r\n                  Foreign Affairs and Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Prime Minister._ Honourable Members,—Last November I began my\r\nstatement to Parliament of the programme of the National Government as\r\nregards foreign policy with the following words:\r\n\r\n“The fundamental principle upon which our foreign policy is based is\r\nthat treaties of peace, once signed and ratified, must be carried out\r\nwhether they are good or bad. A self-respecting nation cannot follow\r\nanother course. Treaties are not eternal or irreparable; they are\r\nchapters and not epilogues in history; to put them into practice means\r\nto try them. If in the course of execution they are proved to be absurd,\r\nthis in itself may constitute the new element which may open the\r\npossibility of a further examination of the respective positions.”\r\n\r\nThe preceding Government had undertaken to present to Parliament the\r\nAgreements concluded at Santa Margherita, and signed at Rome on the 23rd\r\nOctober last. This undertaking I now fulfil.\r\n\r\nThese Agreements, contrary to what has been stated by someone, do not\r\ncontain any new political pledges on the part of Italy, but regulate the\r\nrelations between the Commune of Zara and the surrounding territory of\r\nDalmatia, make clear some recognised rights on the part of citizens who\r\nare Italian by option, and endeavour, by means of friendly agreements,\r\nto find a possibility of giving and assuring a peaceful and industrious\r\nlife to the troubled city of Fiume.\r\n\r\nOwing to the way in which it is drawn up—whether on account of its\r\ndiffuseness in those clauses which touch upon territorial questions, and\r\nits brevity in others, or whether on account of the seeming precedence\r\ngiven to the task of the commissions which ought, according to the\r\nletter of the treaty itself, to proceed exclusively to the settlement of\r\nterritorial questions, while for the commissions to which were entrusted\r\nthe settlement of other questions, limits were established, _a priori_,\r\nof a certain amplitude (Art. VI.)—the Treaty of Rapallo has given\r\nYugoslavia the opportunity of maintaining that it was necessary first to\r\neffect the evacuation of the territories over which the sovereignty of\r\nthe Serbo-Croat-Slovak Kingdom had been recognised, and then of\r\nproceeding to the stipulations of the agreements for the regulation of\r\nthe new relations between the two countries.\r\n\r\nThey tried to justify this with arguments of a political nature. That is\r\nto say, they saw, in the first place, that the opposition met with in\r\nvarious Italian political spheres to the transactions concluded at\r\nRapallo had stirred up the discontent and opposition of the Yugoslavs to\r\nthe treaty; secondly, that the suspended execution of the Territorial\r\nClauses, evidently attributed to some Italian parties, had given the\r\nimpression to the Yugoslavs that Italy did not want to proceed to the\r\ncarrying out of the treaty; thirdly, that, in consequence, the\r\nparliamentary opposition to a policy of friendliness towards Italy had\r\nbecome very marked, and rendered extremely difficult the adoption of\r\ndirect provisions for the favourable regulation of these relations; and\r\nlastly, that if, instead, the prearranged course had been followed—that\r\nof proceeding, say, first to the evacuation of the territories—a radical\r\nchange of position would have been realised, which would have allowed of\r\nthe conclusion of more favourable agreements.\r\n\r\nIn Italy, on the other hand, the discontent was increased by an idea,\r\nentertained by many, that the new State, which had also arisen as the\r\nresult of Italy’s victorious war, ought to give to the citizens, and in\r\nItalian interests, privileges no less great than those granted by the\r\nAustro-Hungarian Monarchy, not taking into account that a national\r\nState, newly formed, may have particular exigencies and\r\nsusceptibilities. The contrast of such opposite tendencies ended by\r\ncreating in the relations between the two countries an atmosphere of\r\nuneasiness, which has at times reached an acute stage. And in Italy, the\r\nintransigence of some circles found justification, above all, in the\r\nweakness of the Governments, inasmuch as they had ground for fearing\r\nthat all our rights would be trodden underfoot the moment we no longer\r\nhad tangible securities in our hands. By the Agreements which are now\r\nhanded to us, the Government of Belgrade has recognised the necessity of\r\ndetermining the régime which will have to regulate the reciprocal\r\nrelations of the new boundaries before passing to the definite execution\r\nof the Territorial Clauses.\r\n\r\nAs for the substance of the Agreements, it is my conviction that their\r\ngreater or less efficacy will depend upon the spirit in which they are\r\ncarried out, because never, perhaps, has it been so true, as in this\r\ncase, that the most perfect pacts become empty formulas if a doubtful or\r\nhostile spirit is brought to their execution.\r\n\r\nI observe, in conclusion, that the uncertainty which has been manifested\r\nin the foreign policy of Italy as regards the Treaty of Rapallo has\r\ncreated a situation unfavourable to her, often preventing her from\r\ntaking a decided attitude, which would have been in her interest, in\r\nmost essential questions of a general nature, and making her appear in a\r\nlight contradictory to her position as a Great Power.\r\n\r\nMy intense, though brief, experience of Government has shown me that it\r\nis not possible to carry out a strong foreign policy without having\r\ndecisive and clearly defined attitudes as regards the other States.\r\n\r\nItaly must get away from this weak situation, must regain her full\r\nliberty and efficiency of action also in this sphere. We shall,\r\ntherefore, carry out the treaty resolutely and loyally, exacting its\r\nscrupulous observance. We shall watch over this as is our right and\r\nduty. And we wait for time to pass definite judgment upon the soundness\r\nand the fate of to-day’s Conventions.\r\n\r\nWith this understanding, I ask you, Honourable Members, to approve of\r\nthe following Project of Law:\r\n\r\n“Full and entire execution is given to the Agreements and Conventions\r\nsigned at Rome on 23rd October 1921, between the Kingdom of Italy and\r\nthe Kingdom of the Serbs, the Croats and the Slovenes for the execution\r\nof the Treaty of Rapallo of 12th November 1920.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        THE AGREEMENTS OF SANTA MARGHERITA, ITALY AND YUGOSLAVIA\r\n\r\n          Chamber of Deputies. Sitting of 10th February 1923.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Prime Minister._ Honourable Members,—With the approval of the\r\nAgreements of Santa Margherita, there came to an end what might be\r\ncalled “the Foreign Policy week” of the Italian Government; a week that\r\nmight also be called pacific, since it began with the ratification of\r\nthe Convention of Washington, which represents a pause in the great\r\nnaval armament, and ends with the approval of the Agreements of Santa\r\nMargherita, which are the consequence of the Treaty of Rapallo already\r\nratified and partly carried out.\r\n\r\nIn closing this week of the life of Parliament, I realise that the\r\nChamber has done good work, and that it has during this session\r\nundoubtedly raised, in some ways, its prestige in the country.\r\n(Comments.) The questions with which the Chamber has dealt are large;\r\nthey are not concerned with treaties and bills of minor importance, as\r\nsome have said.\r\n\r\nI refuse to embark, as was attempted on the Left, upon the usual\r\ndiscussions of a general character which do not conclude anything. While\r\nI am on this bench, the Chamber will not be changed into an electoral\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\n\r\n_No Discussion._ There is nothing to discuss as regards home policy;\r\nthat which happens, happens because it is my direct and clear desire and\r\nin accordance with my precise orders, and for which I naturally assume\r\nfull personal responsibility. (Comments.)\r\n\r\nIt is useless, therefore, to go to the police officials, because the\r\norders are mine. It does not affect me to know of the existence of a\r\nplot, in the sense usually attributed to that word; this will be settled\r\nby competent authorities. But there are those who thought that they\r\nwould fight with impunity against the State and Fascismo. By now they\r\nmust be disillusioned; and they will be more so in the future. The\r\ndifference between the Liberal and Fascista States consists precisely in\r\nthis: that the Fascista State does not defend itself only, but attacks,\r\nand those who intend to slander it abroad and to undermine its authority\r\nat home must be warned that their manœuvres bring with them unforeseen\r\nconsequences. The enemies of the Fascisti must not be surprised if I\r\ntreat them severely as enemies.\r\n\r\nAs regards the speech of Filippo Turati, my old fighting scent did not\r\ndeceive me when a few days ago I refused the advances which came to me\r\nfrom that quarter through Gregorio Nofri, who, having been in Russia,\r\nfelt the overpowering necessity of becoming anti-Bolshevist. Strayed\r\nsheep do not enter my fold. I am still faithful to my old tactics. I do\r\nnot seek anybody. I do not refuse anybody. I put faith above all in my\r\nown forces. This is why, lately—after the meeting of the Great Fascista\r\nCouncil—I desired that there should be a closer union with those parties\r\nwith which, fighting on national ground, friendly relations can be\r\nestablished for common work. But all this, let it be said at once, has\r\nnot been done for parliamentary purposes, but for the sake of cohesion,\r\nunity and the pacification of the country.\r\n\r\nI agree wholly with that which the Hon. Cavazzoni said yesterday with\r\nregard to the eight-hour day. I declared, before a meeting of eight\r\nhundred printers, that the eight-hour day represents an inviolable\r\nconquest on the part of the working classes. To-day there are those who\r\ndream of setting on foot a long discussion because opposing ideas are\r\nattributed to this and that member of the Cabinet. I give definite\r\nnotice that the Government, in one of its forthcoming meetings, will\r\ndecide once and for all the question of the eight-hour day. This having\r\nbeen said, and I hope that everybody will understand also the sense of\r\nall I have not said, I pass on to the subject of foreign policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Circumspect Policy of Activity._ In the meantime, I cannot accept the\r\nstatement of the Hon. Lucci, who makes out that I am original. In the\r\nfirst place, he must give me time. In the second, there is no\r\noriginality in foreign affairs, and I refuse to be original, if this\r\noriginality would result in the slightest damage to my country.\r\n(Applause.) And I cannot accept, either, his too idealistic point of\r\nview. I see the world as it really is, that is to say, a world of\r\nunbounded egoism. If the world was Arcadia, it would be pleasant to\r\namuse oneself with nymphs and shepherds; but I do not see anything of\r\nall this, and even when the more or less respectable standards of great\r\nprinciples are displayed, I see behind them interests which seek for a\r\nfooting in the world. If all foreign policy were brought into the region\r\nof pure idealism, it would certainly not be Italy who would refuse to\r\njoin in. But it is not so; hence all that the Hon. Lucci says belongs to\r\nthe music of the most distant spheres. (Laughter.)\r\n\r\nWhen I first took up my position on this bench, there was a moment of\r\ntrepidation in certain sections of international politics. It was\r\nthought that the advent to power of Fascismo would mean, at the very\r\nleast, war with Yugoslavia. After a few months, international opinion is\r\nfully reassured. The foreign policy of Fascismo cannot be, especially in\r\nthese historic times, other than extremely circumspect, though at the\r\nsame time very active.\r\n\r\nThe nation, having issued from the splendid and blood-stained travail of\r\nthe war, is now fully intent on the work of building up its political,\r\neconomic, financial and moral life. To compel it to make an effort which\r\nwas not absolutely necessary, would be to follow an anti-national and\r\nsuicidal policy. At London, as at Lausanne, Italian foreign policy has\r\npursued this direction; at Lausanne, above all, the work of the Italian\r\nDelegation has been highly appreciated. If peace was not concluded\r\nthere, it was not the fault, in any way, of Italy.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is not good to speak too pessimistically of the\r\ndevelopment of affairs in the Eastern Mediterranean. It must not be\r\nthought that a certain harmless showing of teeth, sometimes the result\r\nof reciprocal restlessness, means the beginning of a war. I think that\r\nif Greece is prudent and the Entente remains firmly united—as in the\r\ncase of their ships in the port of Smyrna—that Turkey too, since she has\r\nrealised a large part of the programme laid down at Angora, will become\r\nreasonable. There is no reason, therefore, to fear military\r\ncomplications in Europe. Still Italy will keep a careful look-out that\r\nthe disturbances resulting upon the events in the Ruhr district shall\r\nnot have serious consequences among the countries of the Danube basin.\r\n\r\nThe situation on the Ruhr is stationary. I declare once again that Italy\r\ncould not have followed a different line of policy. The time for fine\r\ngestures is past, as they are useless. The attitude which was advocated\r\nby certain elements on the Left would have been equally useless. We\r\ncould not have prevented the French from marching on the Ruhr, and we\r\nmight have encouraged the German resistance. Also the other plan of our\r\nmediation could not have been carried out, because no mediation of any\r\nkind is possible if it is not asked for and welcomed. (Applause.)\r\nBesides, England has limited herself to non-technical participation in\r\nthe operations on the Ruhr, but has not pushed her difference of opinion\r\nwith France to the point of withdrawing her troops from the Rhine. It is\r\nopportune to add that France has not asked us, up to now, for formal and\r\nconcrete assistance. Should this happen, it is evident that Italy should\r\nreserve to herself the right of exposing all the complex system of the\r\nrelations between the two countries. (Loud applause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Last Phase of the Adriatic Drama._ As to the Agreements of Santa\r\nMargherita, of which the Chamber is asked to approve, they represent the\r\nlast phase of our sad and lamentable Adriatic drama. I could here reply\r\nin detail, I could show the Hon. Chiesa, for example, how only\r\nyesterday, 9th February, I received a telegram from Belgrade to this\r\neffect: “The Ministry of Yugoslavia communicates that orders have been\r\nsent to the authorities of Spalato that the premises of the school shall\r\nbe evacuated and put at the disposal of the school itself, and that the\r\nhouse which adjoins the Church of Santo Spirito shall be emptied and\r\nhanded over.” I could correct other inaccuracies, but it is not my\r\nbusiness, it is not worth while to descend to the discussion of detail.\r\nI am always of the opinion that this Convention must be carried out in\r\norder to test it. At the same time, I do not feel like defending, at too\r\ngreat a length, a treaty of which I did not approve when it was\r\nconcluded, and which I still hold to be, as regards a great many of its\r\nclauses, absurd and harmful to Italian interests. But matters, to-day,\r\nstand thus: either the treaty must be definitely enforced or denounced.\r\nSince, in present conditions, it cannot be denounced, for that would\r\nmean the reopening of all difficulties, there remains nothing but its\r\nloyal and scrupulous application on our part, as loyal and scrupulous as\r\nthe application on the part of Belgrade will have to be. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nTo wait indefinitely for events which may occur is the worst of systems\r\nat this moment. It is necessary to put an end to a situation which has\r\nbecome unbearable and which gave us all the disadvantages without\r\nassuring us of what might be the advantages of clearly defined\r\nrelations. Moreover it is difficult to understand why the Treaty of\r\nRapallo, of all the treaties which have been made from the beginning of\r\nhistory, should be the only one irreparable and perpetual. No treaty has\r\never withstood new conditions of affairs developed by the progress of\r\ntime. The essential thing, to my mind, is to place ourselves in such a\r\nposition that an eventual revision will enable us to vindicate our\r\neternal rights with dignity and power. (Applause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Government in favour of Fiume and Zara._ By the application of the\r\nAgreements of Santa Margherita the Fascista Government gives a solemn\r\nproof of its probity, its spirit of decision and of absolute loyalty.\r\nBelgrade must do the same. Yugoslavia must take into account the\r\nintrinsic value of this act, and follow, where the Italians who remain\r\nin Dalmatia are concerned, a policy of freedom and judicious action; as\r\na policy which would tend to suppress the Italian element in Dalmatia\r\nwould not be tolerated by the Fascista Government. (Applause.) By the\r\nratification of these Agreements the Government offers Yugoslavia the\r\nopportunity of furthering the economic relations between the two\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nThe Government, which has already done all it can, within the limits of\r\nits possibilities, for Fiume and Zara, will continue to work with the\r\nutmost energy and diligence for these two cities. The evacuation of\r\nSusak having been carried out—and of Susak only, because the Delta and\r\nPorto Baros will still be occupied by our troops until Fiume has become\r\njuridically a perfect State—Italy will continue to interest herself in\r\nthe fate of Fiume, so that she may be restored in a short time to her\r\nancient splendour.\r\n\r\nAs for Zara, her destiny is serious and difficult, and I, for one,\r\nunderstand the tragedy of that city and the suffering of all the\r\nItalians scattered in Dalmatia up as far as Cattaro. But Zara, the\r\nsentinel of Dalmatia, is ready to bear, with the spirit of absolute\r\nnational discipline, the completion of the last act of the Adriatic\r\ndrama.\r\n\r\nThe Government will meet its needs immediately, because Zara must live,\r\nbecause Zara beyond the Adriatic represents one of the most vital\r\nportions of the Italian people. And the people of Zara and Dalmatia may\r\nbe sure that the Government will watch over their fate with the most\r\nloving care. These are not merely words spoken to help them through this\r\ndifficult time; deeds will follow them.\r\n\r\nAs for public, national opinion, it is unanimous in feeling that these\r\nAgreements had to be applied in order that Italy might be free in the\r\never closer international competition, free to carry out a policy of\r\ndefence of her interests and free to influence with increasing activity\r\nthe course of events. I think that the best part of the Italian people\r\nagree in this line of home and foreign policy. (Applause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS OF FOREIGN POLICY BEFORE THE SENATE. THE RUHR; FIUME; ZARA AND\r\n                                DALMATIA\r\n\r\n               Sitting of the Senate, 16th February 1923.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Prime Minister._ Honourable Senators,—After having written the\r\nprefaces and the introductions to the Bills, and after the speech made\r\nin the other branch of Parliament, I do not think that there remains\r\nmuch to say.\r\n\r\nThe very rapidity of the discussion itself bears witness to the fact\r\nthat all these treaties and agreements are already, in a certain sense,\r\nsuperseded. By this I do not wish to deny their importance, but it is a\r\nquestion of treaties and conventions of some time back, and life to-day\r\nmoves at a very great rate. I do not disguise the fact that in\r\ncontinuing the eternal theory of conferences, people have reason to show\r\na certain scepticism about the likelihood of results. (Laughter.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Why Italy intervenes._ Senator Crespi tried to carry the discussion\r\non to general ground—the burning ground of debts and reparations. He\r\ndemands new pacts; but there are none. Perhaps there cannot be any.\r\nWith reference to a recent appeal for Italy’s intervention in this\r\nmatter, if responsible members of Governments, and especially those\r\nengaged or interested in the conflict, turned to Italy, the only\r\nnation in the world which, at this moment, is following a policy of\r\npeace—(Applause.)—I should not hesitate one moment in answering the\r\nappeal.\r\n\r\nThere is a new factor, Senator Crespi, which it would be a good thing to\r\ntake into consideration, though it is one which tends to stifle rather\r\nthan arouse enthusiasm. It is that England and the United States have\r\ncome to an agreement. England has undertaken to pay her debts to\r\nAmerica. It is no good, therefore, for us to entertain too many\r\nillusions about the likelihood of a cancellation of our debts. It would\r\nbe perfectly just, I think, from the strictly moral point of view; but\r\nthe criteria and principles of absolute morality do not as yet guide the\r\nrelations of the peoples. (Approval.)\r\n\r\nIt was said in a foreign Parliament that Italy had attempted to mediate\r\nbetween France and Germany. No such attempt was ever made. My duty was\r\nto make investigations in the European capitals, and I have done so. But\r\nhaving gathered that there was no possibility of proceeding in that\r\ndirection, I drew back, as to continue would have been a great mistake.\r\nI think, however, that the crisis has reached its culminating point. It\r\nis a question now of knowing whether the Entente still exists and still\r\nwill exist. (Comments.)\r\n\r\nI do not think that I shall be revealing secrets if I say here what\r\nmeets the eye of anyone who reads the daily news in the papers. Not a\r\nsingle event has occurred, not a single question arisen, without the\r\nproblem of the unity of action of the Entente having been brought\r\nforward. Of necessity in this political situation there can be no\r\nimprovised action and still less originality. All foreign policies, not\r\nexcluding that of Russia, which is simply terrifying in form and method,\r\nare of a cautious and circumspect nature at this moment. There is no\r\nreason why Italy should follow a different course. When it is a question\r\nof the interests of our nation and of forty million inhabitants who have\r\nthe right to live, it is necessary to be careful about improvisations,\r\nand it is necessary to take into account that, besides our wishes, there\r\nare also the wishes of others.\r\n\r\nIf we had coalfields; if we had in some way solved the problem of raw\r\nmaterials; if we could dispose of large reserves of gold in order to\r\nkeep up the value of our money, we could follow a given policy, even one\r\nof generosity towards Germany. But we cannot afford the luxury of\r\nprodigality and generosity when we have to toil to carry on life, when\r\nwe have to summon all our energies to avoid falling into the abyss.\r\n\r\nAnd so you will agree with me, Honourable Members, that Italy could not\r\nkeep aloof from that which is taking place on the Ruhr, could not\r\ndeprive herself of participation in an economical and technical\r\ncapacity. It is always better, in my opinion, to be present, because\r\nsometimes complicated problems find unexpected solutions. It was not\r\npossible to run the risk capriciously of not being present, in the\r\nevent—not at all improbable—of an economic agreement, as regards iron\r\nand coal, between Germany and France. (Applause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Zara and Dalmatia._ Coming to the Agreements of Santa Margherita, I\r\nunderstand perfectly the grief and anguish expressed in the words of\r\nSenators Tamassia and Tivaroni. Undoubtedly sentiment is a great\r\nspiritual force, both in the lives of individuals and of peoples, but it\r\ncannot be the one dominating influence of foreign policy.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to have the courage to say that Italy cannot remain for\r\never penned up in one sea, even if it is the Adriatic. Beyond the\r\nAdriatic there is the Mediterranean and other seas which can interest\r\nus. The Treaty of Rapallo was, in my opinion, a lamentable transaction,\r\nwhich was the result of a difficult internal situation and of a foreign\r\npolicy which was not marked by its excessive autonomy. And here allow me\r\nto repeat that a strong and dignified foreign policy cannot be carried\r\nout if the nation does not present a daily example of iron discipline.\r\n(Approval.) I do not think that these Agreements of Santa Margherita\r\nsign the death warrant of Zara and Dalmatia. With the last concessions\r\nwe have saved the use of the Italian language for our brothers there.\r\nNow I think it was Gioberti who said that where the language is spoken\r\nthere is the nation. For this reason, if these brothers of ours can\r\nspeak, write and learn in their mother tongue, I think that already one\r\nof the foundations of their Italian nationality is saved.\r\n\r\nFor a decade the Italians of Zara and Dalmatia have resisted the furious\r\nattempts at denationalisation made by the Hapsburg Monarchy. In those\r\ndays Italy could not give active assistance to those brothers; now you\r\nsee that she has another realisation of herself. Those brothers of ours,\r\nwho might have felt themselves forgotten if the Agreements of Santa\r\nMargherita were applied by another nation, cannot feel the same when the\r\ndefinite and necessary application of the Treaty of Rapallo is carried\r\nout by the Government over which I have the honour of presiding and of\r\nwhich the members are those who won the victory. (Applause.) We firmly\r\nbelieve that the strict and scrupulous application of the Agreements of\r\nSanta Margherita on our part, as well as on the part of Yugoslavia, will\r\nsave the Italian character of Zara and Dalmatia. There is no need for me\r\nto repeat that treaties are transactions, and are like the steps of an\r\nequilibrist. No treaty is eternal and perpetual; all that is happening\r\nto-day under our eyes gives us clear warning.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Question of Fiume._ We shall then carry out these Agreements\r\nimmediately and loyally. It must not be thought that the Third Zone is a\r\nkind of vast continent, and that in it we have immense forces. It is a\r\nquestion of the territory round Zara and a group of islands; all told,\r\nwe have only 120 policemen, 18 custom-house guards, and 20 soldiers. At\r\nSusak we have a battalion of infantry. It will be a case of turning them\r\nback to the line of Eneo, because until it is known what is to become of\r\nFiume, Porto Baros and the Delta, they will remain under the control of\r\nItalian troops. (Applause.) What is this Arbitration Commission? It\r\nrepresents an attempt to bring about the existence of that more or less\r\nvital creature, first conceived at Rapallo, known as the Independent\r\nState of Fiume. (Laughter.) One thing is certain, at any rate, and that\r\nis that there are three Italians on the Commission. And another thing is\r\ncertain, and that is that it is not absolutely necessary for Fiume to\r\nbecome a new province of the realm. That there should actually be a\r\nprefect at Fiume is to me a secondary matter; the important thing is\r\nthat Fiume shall keep her spirit sound and intact, that she shall remain\r\nItalian, and that such means shall be found that shall make her a city\r\nwhich lives in itself and for itself and not only through the largess of\r\nthe Italian State. (Loud applause.)\r\n\r\nThe Government, which sometimes makes deeds precede words, has already\r\ntaken steps for the provision of Zara, economically, politically and\r\nspiritually. The same has been done for Dalmatia. It is necessary to\r\nadmit frankly that since the coming of the Fascista Government the\r\nYugoslavs have been less intransigent with regard to us. There is no\r\ndoubt that the definite carrying out of the Treaty of Rapallo is the\r\ncause of great grief to the citizens of Fiume and Zara, of Dalmatia and\r\nmany in the old kingdom.\r\n\r\n(Cries of “It is true.”)\r\n\r\n_Mussolini._ At other times there might perhaps have been difficulties.\r\nBut the Government over which I have the honour of presiding does not\r\nhesitate; it faces difficulties, I was almost going to say seeks them. I\r\nintend to regulate as soon as possible all that more or less successful\r\nheritage of foreign policy left me by my predecessors. It is no good\r\nbeing alarmed by what happens. I have what I dare to call a Roman\r\nconception of history and life. Things must never be thought to be\r\nirreparable. Rome did not believe in the irreparable, even after the\r\nbattle of Cannæ, when she lost the flower of her generation. On the\r\ncontrary, you will remember that the Senate went out to meet Terentius\r\nVarro, who, having wished to undertake the battle against the advice of\r\nPaulus Æmilius, was certainly one of those responsible for the defeat.\r\nRome fell, and rose up again; she marched slowly, but she marched; she\r\nhad a goal to reach, and she intended to reach it. Italy, our Italy, the\r\nItaly which we carry in our hearts, and which is our pride, must be like\r\nthis; the Italy which accepts her destiny when it is imposed, by hard\r\nnecessity, but only while she prepares her spirit and her forces to\r\novercome it some day. (Loud and prolonged applause, many Senators\r\nadvance to congratulate the Prime Minister. Silence being once more\r\nestablished, Mussolini continues.)\r\n\r\nI propose that the Senate, having concluded the discussion suspended\r\nyesterday evening, should be adjourned. I do not know for how long. The\r\nGovernment must be left free to work and to prepare work for the Chamber\r\nand the Senate.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I feel the necessity of thanking the President, who has\r\ndirected the proceedings with that tact and high wisdom for which he is\r\nknown. I am glad that the Senate, in approving of these political and\r\ncommercial treaties—which are two aspects of the same policy—has thus\r\nbrought to a conclusion a part of our foreign policy. I beg the\r\nPresident to accept the expression of my profound admiration.\r\n\r\n_Tittoni, President of the Senate_, replies, reciprocating the words of\r\nthe Prime Minister and praising his spirit and his patriotic faith. He\r\npays tribute to the way in which the Hon. Mussolini has assumed, with a\r\nfirm hand, the direction of public interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       A REVIEW OF EUROPEAN POLITICS IN THEIR RELATION WITH ITALY\r\n\r\n          Speech delivered before the Cabinet, 2nd March 1923.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Prime Minister._ Honourable Colleagues,—The situation on the Ruhr\r\nhas remained stationary during these last weeks. While the two\r\ndisputants seem to settle themselves more rigidly in their respective\r\npositions of passive resistance on the part of Germany and active\r\npressure on the part of Belgium and France, England has not changed her\r\nattitude of benign disapproval and Italy has neither increased nor\r\nreduced the number of technical experts representing her on the Ruhr. So\r\nfar there has not arisen the new factor which would lead, in one sense\r\nor the other, to the solution of the crisis. This new factor could\r\nconsist either in a direct proposal made by one disputant to the other,\r\nor in a request for mediation, or in the modification, on a political\r\nbasis, of the aims which France says she has in view—aims of an economic\r\nnature, which so far have not gone beyond the limit of the payment of\r\nreparations—or else in an increase of the opposition of England which\r\nwould lead to the withdrawal of her troops from the Rhine.\r\n\r\nIt seems, however, clear—notwithstanding the solicitations of an element\r\nof the advanced democracy—that England maintains her attitude of\r\ncircumspect waiting, without impatience or precipitation. The war, which\r\nat the present moment has for its theatre the basin of the Ruhr, is one\r\nof attrition, and it may yet last for some time, in spite of the general\r\nexpectation all over Europe of a rapid conclusion. As I have already\r\nsaid both in the Senate and the Chamber, Italy will not refuse her\r\nassistance in any attempt that may be made to render normal the\r\nsituation in Central Europe as soon as possible, and of this she has\r\ngiven tangible proof in the help afforded, before any other country, to\r\nAustria. The solidarity which Italy was bound to show towards France\r\nupon the common ground of reparations, has given rise to projects of\r\ngreater importance, which might have been interpreted in certain circles\r\nas having been directed against other Powers or to the exclusion of some\r\none of them. An official declaration on the part of the Government has\r\nestablished the truth of the matter. The campaign in certain papers has\r\nnot been approved of and still less authorised. That it is very\r\nopportune that friendly and cordial relations should exist between Italy\r\nand France is the sincere conviction of my Government. It is very much\r\nto be desired that the economic relations between these two neighbouring\r\ncountries shall be intensified and strengthened, and the Government has\r\nworked in this direction in concluding the recent commercial agreement.\r\nBut this has nothing to do with a real treaty of alliance, as has been\r\nsuggested in certain sections of public opinion. The Fascista Government\r\nintends on the whole to follow a line of foreign policy as far as\r\npossible autonomous, and it could never adhere to alliances which did\r\nnot protect the interests of Italy in the highest degree and which did\r\nnot constitute a solid guarantee of peace and prosperity for Italy in\r\nparticular and Europe in general.\r\n\r\nFascista Italy cannot and will not adhere to a system of alliances which\r\ndoes not take into account these fundamental premises. For her to pledge\r\nherself in any way definitely while the Entente is still in a state of\r\ncrisis, and there are still many obscure points in the general situation\r\nin the world, would be unpardonable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Turkey and Peace._ No reliable news has hitherto reached us as to the\r\nintentions of the Government at Angora concerning the acceptance or\r\nnon-acceptance of the projected treaty presented by the Allies to the\r\nTurkish Delegation at Lausanne. Information is contradictory, because,\r\nwhereas on the one hand it is said that, in spite of the moderating\r\ninfluence of Mustapha Kemal and Ismet Pasha, the Assembly of Angora has\r\nshown itself adverse to some of the conditions already accepted by the\r\nTurkish Delegation at Lausanne and intends to re-discuss the projects of\r\nthe treaty, article by article; on the other hand, especially from\r\nBritish quarters, it is continually said that the Turks seem favourably\r\ndisposed towards the rapid conclusion of peace.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the decision of the Government at Angora, it must be\r\nremembered that, once the deliberations of the Assembly are at an end,\r\nthe Turks will, by means of the Secretary-General of the Conference, who\r\nremains for the present at Lausanne, give a definite reply to the Allies\r\nconcerning eventual requests and proposals.\r\n\r\nBetween the Governments at Rome, London and Paris there is in\r\nconsequence an active diplomatic correspondence in progress with the\r\nobject of establishing the common line of action to be adopted by the\r\nAllies in certain important questions, such as that of Capitulations and\r\nthose concerning the Economic Clauses, as well as the course to be\r\nadopted in the eventual resumption of the work of the Conference, if the\r\nTurkish proposals are such as to furnish a serious basis for discussion.\r\nThe British Government is showing itself to be very rigid in this\r\nrespect and seems not to wish to allow discussion upon other than these\r\nthree points:\r\n\r\n(_a_) The formula of the Turko-Grecian reparations.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The formula of the judicial guarantees for foreigners.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Economic Clauses.\r\n\r\nAs regards the first, it is a question of putting in the hands of an\r\nArbitration Commission the reciprocal claims of the two countries, since\r\nthe Turks do not even admit that the Greeks have any claims to present.\r\nFor the second, it is a question of finding a formula which will provide\r\nmore efficient guarantees for foreigners where the searching of private\r\nhouses and arrests are concerned; and as regards the third, of resuming\r\nthe discussion and negotiations upon all economic questions and of\r\nhanding them over to another commission to be dealt with apart from the\r\ntreaty of peace.\r\n\r\nThe Italian Government is fully convinced of the necessity of bringing\r\nabout the conclusion of this peace in order that grave dangers, derived\r\nfrom the actual situation in the East, may be avoided, and in order that\r\nnormal conditions, favourable to the free exercise of trade and\r\nindustry, may be re-established. Although we are resolute in demanding\r\nfrom Turkey the acceptance of the really moderate conditions proposed by\r\nthe Allies, we do not think, however, that every and any request, not\r\nconnected with the three points mentioned above, made by Turkey, should\r\nbe excluded _a priori_, but rather that the possibility of examination\r\nwithout preconception should always be considered where some\r\nwell-defined and limited proposal is concerned.\r\n\r\nAs to procedure, the British Government would be inclined towards the\r\nrenewal of the discussion at Constantinople, while the Italian\r\nGovernment, realising the dangers which would menace the success of the\r\nnegotiations in the surroundings of the Turkish capital, would prefer\r\nthat it should take place at Lausanne with a limited gathering of\r\ntechnical delegates.\r\n\r\nIn any case it will not be possible to make a definite decision about\r\nthis before knowing the answer of the Turkish Government, which is to be\r\ndecided by the vote of the Grand Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memel and the Polish Frontier._ The question of Memel has been solved\r\nin theory, and it is not probable that in practice overpowering\r\nobstacles will be met with, since in the solution the rights of both the\r\nLithuanians and the Poles have been taken into account.\r\n\r\nThis incident has afforded an opportunity of examining generally the\r\nstill uncertain position of Poland with regard to her boundaries. It\r\nseemed to the Italian Government that such uncertainty was pregnant with\r\ndangers, and that it was of the utmost importance to arrive, as soon as\r\npossible, at the recognition of the frontier, the delimitation of which\r\nis reserved for the Allied Powers by the Treaty of Versailles.\r\nConsequently, at the Conference of Ambassadors at Paris, the Government\r\nproposed that such a delimitation should be proceeded with at once, a\r\nproposal which, not having appeared at first to meet with the approval\r\nof the other representatives, has recently been presented again by the\r\nFrench Government, and to which we, for the sake of consistency, have\r\nadhered.\r\n\r\nAs far as the boundaries between Lithuania and Poland are concerned, we\r\nshould have preferred the League of Nations to have been called upon to\r\npass an opinion, so that the largest number of States possible should be\r\ninterested in guaranteeing the decision. Our Allies, however, having\r\ndrawn attention to the fact that the procedure of the League of Nations\r\nis of a length and tediousness which, at the present moment, it is\r\nbetter to avoid, we have also adhered on this point to the French\r\nproposal to hand the question over to the Conference of Ambassadors.\r\n\r\nWe truly hope that Poland and Lithuania will accept the decisions which\r\nthe Conference of Ambassadors thinks it just to make. And this is one of\r\nthose typical cases in which Poland and Lithuania must take into account\r\nthe inevitable necessity of sentiment yielding to reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Problems of the Adriatic. Fiume; Abbazia; Zara._ The Italian\r\nDelegation and part of that of Yugoslavia have already arrived at\r\nAbbazia. At present work has not begun, but will begin as soon as\r\npossible. At our request the Government at Belgrade has replaced Admiral\r\nPriza by Signor Rybar as her representative. The accusations against\r\nAdmiral Priza, as a participator in the legal proceedings which led to\r\nthe condemnation and death of Nazario Sauro, are well known. The\r\nGovernment at Belgrade showed itself to be appreciative of the eminently\r\nmoral reasons for our objection and consented to the substitution—even\r\nat the cost of facing the criticism of the Italophobe opposition—with a\r\ngood-will which seems an excellent omen for the future.\r\n\r\nOur Delegation, too, to the Commission for the Evacuation of the Third\r\nZone is already at Zara, and since the Yugoslav Delegation has also\r\narrived, work can begin at once.\r\n\r\nAn incident which occurred the night before last, when abuse of Zara and\r\nItaly was shouted from a passing Yugoslav steamer within sight of that\r\nport, has already evoked spontaneous and immediate apologies from the\r\nYugoslav consul to our prefect. But I have urged Belgrade to prevent\r\nsuch deplorable, although unimportant, incidents from occurring again.\r\n\r\nI must say that, hitherto, the Yugoslav Government has shown itself to\r\nbe animated on the whole by excellent feeling, and loyally co-operates\r\nin seeking to smooth the way in this period of important and delicate\r\nnegotiations which has just begun.\r\n\r\nAs for the attitude of the national elements at Zara and Fiume, they\r\nremain inspired by a high sense of discipline and recognition of the\r\nnecessity of subordinating private interests to the general welfare of\r\nthe nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Conference of the Südbahn._ The work of the Conference of the\r\nSüdbahn for the purpose of technical and administrative reorganisation\r\nhas made sufficient progress. Both the States interested and the company\r\nhave presented their proposals for amendments, in which they try,\r\nwithout interfering with the basis of the projects under discussion, to\r\nlessen the financial burden.\r\n\r\nThe project of the agreement concerning through traffic, which contains\r\nregulations guaranteeing the regularity of the organisation of the\r\nrailways, facilities for the customs and sanitary services, and the\r\nsetting in order of the international stations, as well as regulations\r\nregarding the railway rates of the through trains, has already been\r\ndiscussed. The States have shown themselves to be of one opinion with\r\nregard to the intentions of the project, which tend to unite in a\r\nspecial convention all the different regulations which have issued from\r\nthe treaties of peace and the projects of the Convention concluded at\r\nBarcelona and Portorose.\r\n\r\nThe project, moreover, is directed particularly towards reviving the\r\npowers of the Convention of Berne in respect of international traffic.\r\nThe scheme of agreement for the technical and administrative\r\nreorganisation of the Südbahn admits the possibility of direct control\r\non the part of the State as well as on the part of the company. It aims\r\nalso at the maintenance of that unity of commercial direction which,\r\nwithout offending the sovereignty of the States with regard to tariffs,\r\nwill allow of international traffic and the direct despatching of goods,\r\nand will take into account the special exigencies of trade which require\r\nparticular measures and which, not being prejudicial to the States, will\r\nbe advantageous as regards the economic relations between them.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Conference will probably last another week on account of\r\nthe complicated and difficult character of the various financial,\r\ntechnical and administrative problems to be solved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        THE ITALO-YUGOSLAV CONFERENCE FOR THE COMMERCIAL TREATY\r\n\r\n  Opening address delivered in Rome at the Palazzo Chigi, on 6th March\r\n              1923, before the members of the Conference.\r\n\r\n\r\nGentlemen,—I am particularly glad to open this meeting and welcome\r\ncordially the delegates of the Kingdom of the Serbs, the Croats and the\r\nSlovenes. I attach great importance to this meeting and to its results,\r\nwhich I am confident will be excellent.\r\n\r\nYou know that at Abbazia the Adriatic question is being settled, so that\r\nat the present time the field may be cleared of those special problems\r\nwhich up to to-day have not permitted an understanding with Yugoslavia.\r\n\r\nAlong with that of Abbazia, this meeting, convened with the object of\r\nlinking together more closely commercial relations between the two\r\ncountries, attains a great importance. Italian public opinion and the\r\nFascista Government consider that, together with political relations,\r\nthere must be close and profitable economic ties.\r\n\r\nI am certain that the Italian delegates will make every effort to arrive\r\nat this agreement and I do not doubt that the Yugoslav Delegation will\r\ndo the same. This will be in the common interest of the two countries.\r\n(Applause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n “HISTORY TELLS US THAT STRICT FINANCE HAS BROUGHT NATIONS TO SECURITY”\r\n\r\n  Speech delivered at the Ministry of Finance on 7th March 1923, where\r\n  Mussolini officially handed over to the Minister, Hon. de Stefani,\r\n  the Budgets of Home and Foreign Affairs, to be revised in accordance\r\n  with a decision of the Council of Ministers.\r\n\r\n\r\nHonourable Ministers, Colleagues, Gentlemen,—It might be asked, Why such\r\nfuss, why so many soldiers for a ceremony which could be described as\r\npurely administrative, such as the consignment of my two Budgets to the\r\nFinance Minister? We must answer this question thus: For various\r\nmotives, some more plausible than others. The solemnity which\r\naccompanies this ceremony serves to demonstrate the immense importance\r\nthe Government attaches to a rapid restoration of financial normality.\r\nWe have formally promised to make a start towards balancing the State\r\nBudget, and with this promise we wish to keep faith at whatever cost. We\r\nmust be convinced that if the whole falls, the part falls too; and that\r\nif the economic life of the nation falls in ruin, all that is in the\r\nnation—institutions, men, classes—is destined to suffer the same fate.\r\n\r\nAnd why these soldiers? To show that the Government has strength. I\r\ndeclare that, if possible, I want to govern with the consent of the\r\nmajority of the people, but whilst waiting for this consent to be\r\nformed, to be nourished, to be strengthened, I collect the maximum\r\navailable force. Because it may happen, by chance, that force may aid in\r\nrediscovering consent, and, at any rate, should consent be lacking,\r\nforce still remains. In all the measures—even the most drastic—the\r\nGovernment takes, we shall put before the people this dilemma: either\r\naccept them from a high spirit of patriotism or submit to them. This is\r\nhow I conceive the State, and how I understand the art of governing the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nI am glad to find myself before you—(continued the President, turning to\r\nthe officials of the Ministry of Finance present at the\r\nceremony)—because the Minister has spoken very favourably to me of the\r\nhigh officials of the Ministry of Finance. He told me that some of you\r\noften work up to sixteen hours a day. Well done! Those are long hours,\r\nbut it is a splendid example. But if they were not sufficient, it would\r\nbe necessary to work even twenty hours. Only thus, gentlemen, shall we\r\nrise up out of the sea of our present difficulties and reach the shore.\r\n\r\nWe must inculcate in our spirit a sense of absolute discipline. We must\r\nconsider that the money of the Treasury is sacred above everything else.\r\nIt does not rain down from Heaven, nor can it even be made with a turn\r\nof the printing press, which, if I could, I would like to smash to\r\npieces. It is made out of the sweat, it might be said of the blood, of\r\nthe Italian people, who work to-day, but who will work more to-morrow.\r\nEvery _lira_, every _soldo_, every _centesimo_ of this money must be\r\nconsidered sacred and should not be spent unless reasons of strict and\r\nproved necessity demand it. _The history of peoples tells us that strict\r\nfinance has brought nations to security._ I feel that each one of you\r\nbelieves in this truth, which is fully proved by history.\r\n\r\nWith this conviction I bid you farewell. (Applause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n “IT IS NOT THE ECONOMIC SYSTEM OF EUROPE ALONE THAT WE HAVE TO RESTORE\r\n                        TO ITS FULL EFFICIENCY”\r\n\r\n   Speech delivered at the Palazzo dell’ Esposizione in Rome, on 18th\r\n    March 1923, before the International Congress of the Chambers of\r\n                               Commerce.\r\n\r\n\r\nGentlemen,—The Government over which I have the honour to preside and\r\nwhich I represent is glad to welcome you to Rome and offers you a\r\ndeferential and cordial greeting, which I extend also to the foreign\r\nrepresentatives, who have wished to honour us by their presence. The\r\nfact that your important Congress is held in the capital of Italy, only\r\nfive months after the events which gave the control of public affairs to\r\nthe youthful forces of war and of victory is the best declaration to the\r\nworld that the Italian nation is rapidly returning to the full normality\r\nof her political and economical life. In a meeting like this I shall not\r\nlinger on the former, but shall briefly dwell on the latter subject.\r\n\r\nThe economic policy of the new Italian Government is simple. I consider\r\nthat the State should renounce its industrial functions, especially of a\r\nmonopolistic nature, for which it is inadequate. I consider that a\r\nGovernment which means to relieve rapidly peoples from after-war crises\r\nshould allow free play to private enterprise, should renounce any\r\nmeddling or restrictive legislation, which may please the Socialist\r\ndemagogues, but proves, in the end, as experience shows, absolutely\r\nruinous.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, time to remove from the shoulders of the producing\r\nforces of every nation the last remains of that machinery which was\r\ncalled the trappings of war and to examine economic problems, no longer\r\nwith a state of mind veiled by the influence of particular interests, as\r\nthey had to be examined during the war. I do not believe that the\r\naggregate of forces, which in industry, in agriculture, in commerce, in\r\nbanking, in transportation may be called by the world-name of\r\ncapitalism, is near its downfall, as certain doctrinarians belonging to\r\nthe Social-Extremists have claimed. One of the great historical\r\nexperiences of which we have been witnesses proves that all the systems\r\nof associated economics which do away with private initiative and\r\nindividual effort fail more or less pitifully in a short time. But free\r\ninitiative does not exclude an agreement between groups, which will be\r\nrealised all the easier when there is a loyal protection of each\r\nseparate interest. Your Chamber of Commerce follows exactly this\r\nprogramme of enquiry, and of stabilisation, of co-ordinating and\r\nconciliating the various interests. You are here in Rome to discuss the\r\nbest means to revive the great currents of trade which, before the war,\r\nhad increased general wealth and brought all people to a high standard\r\nof living. These are weighty and delicate problems which often cause\r\ndiscussions of a political and moral nature. To solve them we must be\r\nguided by the conviction that _it is not the economic system of Europe\r\nalone that we have to restore to its full efficiency_, but that there\r\nare also countries and continents which may offer a field for a larger\r\neconomic activity in the near future. It is not without significance\r\nthat the powerful Republic of the United States has sent such a large\r\nnumber of her representatives to Rome. It means that, if official\r\npolitical America still keeps an attitude of reserve, economic America\r\nfeels that she cannot remain indifferent to what may or may not be done\r\nin Europe.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that Governments—beginning with mine—will examine with\r\nthe utmost care and give due weight to the decisions which are arrived\r\nat by this Congress. (Loud cheers.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n “ONLY THOSE WHO PROFITED BY THE WAR GRUMBLED AND STILL GRUMBLE, CURSED\r\n                      AND STILL CURSE AT THE WAR”\r\n\r\n   Speech delivered on 29th March 1923, in Milan, at Villa Mirabello,\r\n                       before blind ex-soldiers.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dear Comrades!—When a little time ago one of your officers told me\r\nthat you never grumbled at the war, even when Italy seemed overwhelmed,\r\nI was not surprised because only those who profited by the war grumbled\r\nand still grumble, cursed and still curse at the war. Those who have\r\nperformed their duty do not grumble, do not curse, but accept their\r\nsacrifice with Roman simplicity and austerity.\r\n\r\nWhen I am amongst the maimed I live again the greatest days of our war.\r\nAnd I declare to you that a Government which did not bear you in mind\r\nwould be unworthy, and would only be worthy of being overthrown by the\r\nfury of the people.\r\n\r\nBut the Government which I represent is entirely formed of men who have\r\nfought from the Stelvio to the sea of Trieste, and such men cannot\r\nignore the sacrifices accomplished.\r\n\r\nI express to you here this morning all my brotherly sympathy and\r\nadmiration as an ex-soldier, as a man, as an Italian, and I embrace you\r\nall. And by this act I intend to honour and exalt all those who\r\ncontributed to the greatness of the mother country by the deeds\r\naccomplished and by the shedding of their blood. (Applause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                “PATRIOTISM IS NOT FORMED BY MERE WORDS”\r\n\r\n   Speech delivered at Arosio, near Milan, on 30th March 1923, before\r\n                ex-soldiers suffering from shell-shock.\r\n\r\n\r\nFellow-Soldiers,—I did well to accept your courteous invitation, in the\r\nfirst place, as it always gives me great pleasure to offer to my\r\ncomrades of the trenches the proof of my fraternal sympathy as a\r\nsoldier, as a man, as an Italian, and as the head of the Government.\r\n\r\nAs I said yesterday to the blind ex-soldiers at Villa Mirabello, so I\r\nsay to you. The Government intends to protect you, intends to satisfy\r\nyour requests, to defend your material and moral rights.\r\n\r\nYour invitation has given me the opportunity to see this splendid work,\r\nwhich represents the results and the harmonious synthesis of faith in\r\nyour undertakings and of noble love for our country.\r\n\r\nEverything that is done for the maimed and for ex-soldiers is a small\r\nthing in face of the sacrifice of so many Italians who gave their life\r\non the battlefields or who shed their blood.\r\n\r\nWhat is done here is not only a manifestation of piety, it is an\r\nexpression of national solidarity and of conscientious patriotism.\r\nBecause patriotism is not formed by mere words, it is formed by deeds,\r\nby example, by showing oneself worthy before one’s own conscience of the\r\nquality of being Italian.\r\n\r\nThe Government intends to exalt all the forces of the country, all the\r\nmoral forces arising from our victory; it means daily and\r\ndisinterestedly to defend all those who by their deeds and their blood\r\nhave contributed to this glorious victory. (Applause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             QUESTIONS OF FOREIGN POLICY BEFORE THE CABINET\r\n\r\n         Speech delivered before the Cabinet on 7th April 1923.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Abbazia Conference._ Colleagues,—The Commission appointed according\r\nto the Agreements of Santa Margherita, which met, as is known, on 1st\r\nMarch, started its work by the arrangement for the evacuation of Susak,\r\nwhich took place on the following day. It is opportune here to note that\r\nthe Italian Delegation wished to express to the world and to the Italian\r\ntroops its gratitude for the courteous and chivalrous behaviour during\r\nthe whole occupation of Susak.\r\n\r\nThe Commission decided, at that time, a provisional settlement for\r\ncommunication and traffic between Fiume and Susak, which was made\r\neffective for two months, in view of the eventuality of the prorogation\r\nof the sittings of the Commission. The frontier traffic between Castua\r\nand the adjacent territories was also organised.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the military operations, the Serbo-Croatian-Slovak\r\nDelegation has at once recorded an objection, on the grounds that with\r\nthe evacuation of Susak, it did not consider that that stipulated by the\r\nAgreements of Santa Margherita had been carried out, seeing that the\r\nDelta and Porto Sauro remained occupied by Italian troops. Against this\r\nassertion the Italian Delegation replied that Italy had carried out to\r\nthe letter the provisions of the Agreements of Santa Margherita, which\r\nrefer purely and simply to the evacuation of Susak.\r\n\r\nApart from this objection, the Commission has continued its work and the\r\nItalian Delegation has put forward a project for a Consortium in the\r\nport of Fiume between the three interested States. Such a project, in a\r\ngeneral way, attributes to Fiume the character of an international port,\r\nleaving the possibility of the enjoyment of special privileges and\r\nguarantees to each of the contracting States for a freer development of\r\nthe traffic which affects them. With regard to such a project, the\r\nSerbo-Croatian-Slovak Delegation has put forward its objections,\r\npresenting on its own account a draft of a project, according to which\r\nthe Sauro Basin and the Delta would be excluded from the port of Fiume\r\nand assigned exclusively to Yugoslavia.\r\n\r\nThe Italian Delegation has formally declared that it could not accede to\r\nany pact whatsoever which, destroying the unity of the port of Fiume,\r\nwould irremediably damage the future of the new State, and, in answer to\r\nthe objections raised by the Serbo-Croatian-Slovak Delegation to the\r\nItalian project, our Delegation has presented another plan, in which\r\nfull consideration was given to the said exceptions. But, in the course\r\nof the following discussion, the points of view of the two Delegations\r\ncould not be reconciled. The sittings were suspended on 24th March, to\r\nbe resumed shortly.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The new Lausanne Conference._ Following the counterproposals put\r\nforward by the Government of Angora, the British Government has convened\r\nin London an Inter-Allied meeting in order to examine what modifications\r\nto the drafting and the substance of the Peace Treaty presented to the\r\nTurks on the 30th of last January may be possible. The Allied\r\nRepresentatives at this meeting have decided to invite the Turks to\r\nresume as soon as possible at Lausanne the discussion with the Allied\r\nexperts and have at the same time come to an agreement as to the line of\r\nconduct to follow in such a discussion.\r\n\r\nIn the text of the reply sent to the Government of Angora, which has\r\nbeen published, the Allies have deemed it opportune to insert some\r\nremarks and objections on certain points of special importance, as for\r\nexample that regarding the removal of the Economic Clauses asked by the\r\nTurks, to which the Allies cannot accede; that concerning some part of\r\nthe judiciary declarations and the Turkish demands relative to\r\nsubstantial modifications of the Territorial Clauses already agreed\r\nupon, such as that of Castelrosso, whose restoration to Turkey could not\r\nbe countenanced.\r\n\r\nIt is to be hoped that the good-will that both parties have the\r\nintention of displaying in the imminent negotiations of Lausanne may\r\nbring about speedily the conclusion of peace in the East, which\r\ncorresponds with the warmest wish and interest of the Italian\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Italo-Polish Relations._ Mr. Skrzynski came to Milan to express to me\r\nthe gratitude of Poland for the friendly attitude of Italy in the\r\ndetermination of the Polish frontier, which took place recently.\r\nExpressing a personal view, I mentioned to him the advisability of a\r\nlarger extension of autonomy to the population of Eastern Galicia. I\r\nprofited by the occasion to examine with the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs some concrete points, which, with regard to oil and coal,\r\nconcern more closely our commerce. I recognised with satisfaction the\r\nfriendly disposition which animates the Polish Government and I was\r\nstruck with the impression that whenever important Italian enterprises\r\nshould wish to develop their activity in Poland, they would find there\r\nthe best of welcomes. The representatives of some Italian firms of\r\nstanding, moreover, are now already in negotiation at Warsaw, and the\r\nresults, I hope, will in a short time confirm the favourable attitude of\r\nthe Polish Foreign Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Visit of the Austrian Chancellor Seipel._ In the conversations I\r\nhad at Milan with the Austrian Chancellor, both parties expressed the\r\nreciprocal desire and interest to improve further relations between the\r\ntwo countries. The Chancellor has warmly thanked the Italian Government\r\nfor the helpful action on behalf of Austria and has asked our support\r\nfor the satisfactory solution of all problems which might contribute to\r\nthe economic reconstruction of the Republic. I gave favourable\r\nassurances and, consequently, have accordingly hastened the negotiations\r\nalready begun for a commercial agreement and I have had examined\r\nnumerous questions which had been dragging on unsolved for some time.\r\n\r\nIt is to be hoped that, the last difficulties having been removed, the\r\nCommercial Treaty may be signed within a few days. The Clauses of the\r\nPortorose Conventions, signed and not ratified by the contracting\r\nparties, will be included in it. The Chancellor has asked that the small\r\nAustrian properties in Italy and the historical Austrian Institute in\r\nRome should be restored to Austria, as was done for Germany. While I\r\ndeclared myself favourable to his requests, I have, for my part,\r\nreminded him of the situation of Italian property in Austria and have\r\nobtained from the Chancellor satisfactory assurances concerning this and\r\nother subjects. With reference to the Conventions signed at the\r\nConference of Rome, some of which have notable importance for Italy, the\r\nChancellor has promised to proceed to their ratification without further\r\ndelay.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Commercial Relations with Austria._ The negotiations with Austria\r\nare being conducted with a spirit of the greatest good-will on both\r\nsides, in order to arrive in a short space of time at an agreement which\r\nshould establish regular and profitable relations between the two\r\ncountries and also after the first period, during which the economic\r\nrelations between the two States are regulated by the Treaty of St.\r\nGermain. If some difficulty still remains, this is due in the first\r\nplace to the fact that it is not the case of negotiating pacts which,\r\nwith regard to their application and their consequences, could remain\r\nrestricted to the exchanges between the two neighbouring States, but are\r\ndestined to have a repercussion also on our relations with the other\r\nStates which, for their imports into Italy, enjoy the “most favoured\r\nnation” clause.\r\n\r\nThis fact, independently of the specially favourable conditions by which\r\ncertain important industries, competing with ours, are working in\r\nAustria, compels us to be very cautious in adhering to the many Austrian\r\nrequests, and all the more that, for financial and other reasons,\r\nAustria is herself not in a position to meet our demands to the extent\r\nwhich is essential to us. The two Delegations have, however, already\r\narrived at an agreement on most of the questions which have been the\r\nsubject of reciprocal demands, and now certain controversies remain to\r\nbe solved which, although they offer the greatest interests for both\r\nsides, it is to be hoped may be solved with satisfaction to all.\r\n\r\nSpecial attention has been paid by the two Delegations to the study of\r\nthe questions relative to the traffic through the port of Trieste and\r\nthe regulation of the frontier traffic for the protection of the\r\ninterests of the populations of the zone near the frontier of the two\r\nStates. On this subject agreement may be said to be complete.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Commercial Treaty with Yugoslavia._ The negotiations with\r\nYugoslavia, which should lead to the regulation of all the economic and\r\nfinancial questions still pending between the two States, have been\r\nconducted so far on the Treaty of Commerce, which, except for the part\r\nconcerning the Italian proposals on the tariffs, may be said to be\r\nalready agreed upon by the two Delegations. With reference to the other\r\nsubjects under examination, of which only a small part has been possible\r\nto discuss at the same time as the negotiations for the Commercial\r\nTreaty, the Yugoslav Delegation is now awaiting further instructions\r\nfrom Belgrade. Besides the commercial negotiations I have mentioned,\r\nthere are others proceeding for a Commercial Treaty with Spain.\r\nNegotiations will shortly be opened for commercial agreements with Siam,\r\nFinland, Esthonia, Lithuania, Lettonia and Albania.\r\n\r\n(After a short discussion, in which several Ministers participated, the\r\nCabinet approved the declarations of the Prime Minister.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          “MINE IS NOT A GOVERNMENT WHICH DECEIVES THE PEOPLE”\r\n\r\n  Speech delivered at the Palazzo Municipale on 2nd June 1923, to the\r\n                         _contadini_ of Rovigo.\r\n\r\n\r\nFascisti,—How shall I find adequate words to thank you for this\r\nmagnificent welcome? A few moments ago your mayor gave voice to the\r\ngreeting of the city and the province. To-day I have passed through your\r\nfertile lands, furrowed by rivers, exploited by your tenacious work. All\r\nItaly must be grateful to this industrious people, who, too, having\r\nrealised the beautiful and supreme interests of the nation, has now all\r\nthe more the right to be treated with greater friendship and\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nI know that I am speaking to an assembly where workers are certainly in\r\nenormous majority. Well, I say to them with calm words and with a still\r\ncalmer conscience that the Government which I have the honour to\r\nrepresent is not, cannot, and will never be against the working classes.\r\n(Loud applause.) Six months of Government are still too few for a\r\nprogramme to be carried through, but, to my mind, they are sufficient to\r\ngive an idea of its _directives_ which to-day are precise and sound.\r\n_Mine is not a Government which deceives the people._ (Applause.) We\r\ncannot, we shall not, make promises if we are not mathematically sure of\r\nbeing able to fulfil them. The people have been too long deceived and\r\nmystified for the men of our generation to continue this low trade.\r\n\r\nWe have traced a furrow, very clear-cut and deep, between that which was\r\nthe Italy of yesterday and that which is the Italy of to-day. In the\r\nlatter, all classes must have a sphere of action for their fruitful\r\nco-operation. The struggle between classes may be an episode in the life\r\nof a people, it cannot be the daily system, as it would mean the\r\ndestruction of wealth, and, therefore, universal poverty. The\r\nco-operation, citizens, between him who labours and him who employs\r\nlabour, between him who works with his hands and him who works with his\r\nbrains, all these elements of production have their inevitable and\r\nnecessary grades and constitutions. Through this programme you will\r\nattain a state of well-being and the nation prosperity and greatness. If\r\nI were not sure of my words I would not utter them before you on such a\r\nsolemn and memorable occasion. (Applause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n(At this point of the speech an aeroplane piloted by Ferrarin was\r\nexecuting some daring evolutions just above the Palazzo Municipale, from\r\nwhere Mussolini was speaking. The Prime Minister stopped for a few\r\nseconds following Ferrarin’s evolutions, then went on:)\r\n\r\n\r\nFascisti! The other day I was passing in one of those aeroplanes over\r\nyour town. That flight was profoundly significant, as it was meant to\r\nshow that six months of tenure of office have not yet nailed me down\r\ninto my Presidential easy chair and that I, as you, as all of you, am\r\nstill ready to dare, to fight, if necessary, to die, so that the fruits\r\nof the great Fascista revolution may not be lost!\r\n\r\nLong live Fascismo! Long live Italy! (Loud applause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   “IN TIME PAST AS IN TIME PRESENT, WOMAN HAD ALWAYS A PREPONDERANT\r\n            INFLUENCE IN SHAPING THE DESTINIES OF HUMANITY”\r\n\r\n Speech delivered at Padua at the first Women’s Fascista Congress, on 2nd\r\n                                June 1923.\r\n\r\n\r\nLadies,—If I am not mistaken, this, which is inaugurated here to-day, is\r\nthe first Women’s Fascista Congress of the “three Venices.” The title\r\nand the field covered by this first Congress of yours are full of\r\nprofound significance. Fifty years ago one could not speak of the “three\r\nVenices”! Venice herself, after the magnificent years of heroism of 1848\r\nand 1849, was still held by the shackles of foreign slavery. In 1866 we\r\nliberated Venice, one of the Venices. Fifty years afterwards we\r\nliberated the other two—that which has as its boundary the devoted and\r\nimpregnable Brenner, and the other which has as its boundary the not\r\nless devoted nor less impregnable Nevoso.\r\n\r\nFascisti do not belong to the multitude of fops and sceptics who mean to\r\nbelittle the social and political importance of woman. What does the\r\nvote matter? You will have it! But even when women did not vote and did\r\nnot wish to vote, _in time past as in time present, woman had always a\r\npreponderant influence in shaping the destinies of humanity_. Thus the\r\nwomen of Fascismo, who bravely wear the glorious “black shirt,” and\r\ngather round our standards, are destined to write a splendid page of\r\nhistory, to help, with self-sacrifice and deeds, Italian Fascismo.\r\n\r\nDo not trust the little stuffed owls, the yelling monkeys or, indeed,\r\nany representative of the lower zoological orders, who believe they\r\npractise politics, but could be called by a more infamous name. Do not\r\nbelieve those who talk of crises within the ranks of Fascismo;—these are\r\ndetails, mere episodes in the great event, and they, after all, concern\r\nmen, not masses. When Fascisti have not to strike the enemy, they can\r\nwell afford themselves the luxury of internal quarrels. But if the enemy\r\nshould begin to raise his head again and intensify the character of his\r\nmore or less stupid opposition, then Fascisti will again become solidly\r\nunited. Then “Woe to the vanquished!” (Applause.) And since the\r\nopportunity is propitious, I would like to tell you, women of Fascismo,\r\nand the Fascisti of all Italy, that the attempt to sever Mussolini from\r\nFascismo or Fascismo from Mussolini is the most useless and grotesque\r\nattempt that could be conceived. (Applause.) I am not so proud as to say\r\nthat I who speak and Fascismo are one; but four years of history have\r\nnow clearly shown that Mussolini and Fascismo are two aspects of the\r\nsame thing, are two bodies and one soul or two souls in a single body. I\r\ncannot forsake Fascismo, because I have created it, I have reared it, I\r\nhave strengthened and I have chastened it, and I still hold it in my\r\nfist, always! It is, therefore, quite useless for the old screech-owls\r\nof Italian policy to pay me their foolish court. I am too shrewd to fall\r\ninto this ambush of the commercial mediocrities of village fairs. I can\r\nassure you, my dear friends, that all these little vipers, all these\r\ncheap politicians will be bitterly disillusioned.\r\n\r\nTo think that I could become brutalised in Parliamentary bureaucracy is\r\nto believe an absurdity. Although I come from the working class, I have\r\na spirit too aristocratic not to feel disgust for low Parliamentary\r\nmanœuvres. We shall continue our march vigorously (added the Hon.\r\nMussolini, raising his voice), because this has been imposed on us by\r\ndestiny. We shall not turn back, nor shall we even mark time. I have\r\nalready said that we did not want to push matters to extremes only to\r\nsee ourselves driven back by the swing of the pendulum. I prefer, as I\r\nwrote in an article, which aroused some interest—I prefer to march on\r\ncontinually, day by day, in the Roman way, in the way of Rome who is\r\nnever reconciled to defeat; of Rome who welcomed Terentius Varro coming\r\nfrom Cannæ, although she knew that he had given battle against the\r\nopinion of Consul Paulus Æmilius and was, in a certain degree,\r\nresponsible for the defeat; of Rome who after Cannæ forbade matrons to\r\nsally forth, so that their grief-stricken bearing should not shake the\r\nstrength of the citizens; of this Rome who re-wrote continually the\r\nchapters of her history, who found in every ill-success the incentives\r\nto endurance, to steadfastness, to strengthen her spirits, to harden her\r\nnerves, to light the flame of passion! This is the Rome of whom we\r\ndream; the Rome in whom all hierarchies are respected, those of\r\nstrength, beauty, intelligence, and human kindness; the Rome who struck\r\nhard at her enemies, but then raised them up again and made them share\r\nher great destiny; the Rome who left the utmost liberty to the beliefs\r\nof her subject-peoples, provided only that they obeyed her!\r\n\r\nGiuseppe Mazzini used to say that power is but the unity and\r\nperseverance of all efforts put together. Well, Italian power, Fascista\r\npower, the power of all the new generations which expand in this superb\r\nspring of our life and history, will be the result of the unity of our\r\nefforts, of the tenacity of our work. After all, what do Fascisti ask\r\nfor? They are not ambitious or factious. They have the sense of\r\nlimitation and of their responsibility. And I am sure of interpreting\r\nyour thought, the deep craving of your soul, if I say that Fascisti,\r\nfrom the first to the last, from the leaders to the led, ask only one\r\nthing: To serve with humility, with devotion, with steadfastness, our\r\nbeloved Mother Country, Italy! (The speech was greeted with enthusiastic\r\napplause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  “SO LONG AS THESE STUDENTS AND THESE UNIVERSITIES EXIST, THE NATION\r\n  CANNOT PERISH AND BECOME A SLAVE, BECAUSE UNIVERSITIES SMASH FETTERS\r\n               WITHOUT ALLOWING THE FORGING OF NEW ONES”\r\n\r\n     Speech delivered at the University of Padua on 3rd June 1923.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Chancellor, Professors, My Young Friends,—It is not I who honour\r\nyour University, it is your University which honours me, and I must\r\nconfess that, although on account of my laborious dealings with men I am\r\na little refractory to emotions, to-day, being among you, I feel deeply\r\ntouched.\r\n\r\nWe have known each other for some time, from 1915, from the days of that\r\nMay always radiant. I remember that the students of Padua hung up at the\r\ndoors of this University a big paper puppet representing a politician\r\nabout whom I do not wish to express any opinion now. But that act meant\r\nthat the youth of the University of Padua did not want to hear about\r\nignoble diplomatic bargains—(Applause.)—did not want to sell its\r\nsplendid spiritual birthright for a more or less wretched mess of\r\npottage. The University of Padua, the students, who were not degenerate\r\ndescendants of those Tuscan students who went out to die at Curtatone\r\nand Montanara, wished then to be the vanguard, to take up their post in\r\nthe fighting line, carrying with them the reluctant ones, chastening the\r\npusillanimous, overthrowing the Government and going out to fight, to\r\nsacrifice and death, but also to honour and glory.\r\n\r\nFrom that time I know that among you there are faithful followers and\r\nthat this University among all the others is truly an active centre of\r\nfaith and of intense patriotism. If I look back for a moment to the\r\nrolling by of centuries, I recognise in this University a great fountain\r\nat which thousands of men of all countries, of all generations, of all\r\nraces, have quenched their thirst.\r\n\r\nThe Government which I have the honour to represent repudiates, at any\r\nrate in the person of its chief, the doctrine of materialism and the\r\ndoctrines which claim to explain the very complex history of humanity\r\nonly from the material point of view, to explain an episode, not the\r\nwhole of history, an incident, not a doctrine. Well, this Government\r\nprizes individual, spiritual and voluntary qualities, holds in high\r\nesteem the Universities, because they represent so many glorious strong\r\npoints in the life of the people. In fact I do not hesitate to state\r\nthat if Germany has been able to resist the powerful influence of\r\nBolshevism, it is due, above all, to the strong University traditions of\r\nthat people.\r\n\r\nA people with an ardent spirit and with genius like ours is necessarily\r\na well-balanced and harmonious one. The Government understands the\r\nenormous historic importance of Universities, has a respect for their\r\nnoble traditions and wishes to raise them to the heights of modern\r\nexigencies. All this cannot be done at once, as everything cannot be\r\naccomplished in six months. All that we are doing at present is to clear\r\nthe ground from all the débris which the rotten political caste has left\r\nus as a said inheritance. (Applause.) How could a Government composed of\r\nformer soldiers ever disparage Universities? It would not only be absurd\r\nbut criminal! From the Universities have come out by the thousands\r\nvolunteers and by tens of thousands those magnificent warriors who used\r\nto assault the enemy’s trenches with a superb contempt of death. They\r\nare our comrades whose memory we bear engraved in our hearts. You will\r\nwrite their names on your gates of bronze, but their memory will be more\r\nimperishably engraved in our spirit. We cannot forget them, as we cannot\r\nforget that out of the Universities came by thousands the “black\r\nshirts,” those “black shirts” who, at a given moment, put an end to the\r\ninglorious vicissitudes of Italian politics, who took by the throat with\r\nstrong fingers all the old profiteers who appeared, to the exuberant\r\nimpatience of the new Italian generations, always the more inadequate\r\nfor their paralysing decrepitude. (Applause.) Well, so long as there are\r\nUniversities in Italy—and there certainly will be for a long time—and so\r\nlong as there are young men to attend these Universities and to become\r\nacquainted with the history of yesterday, thus preparing the history of\r\nto-morrow, so long as there are such young men, the doors of the past\r\nare definitely shut. I guarantee it formally! But I add further that _so\r\nlong as these young men and these Universities exist, the Nation cannot\r\nperish and it cannot become a slave, because Universities smash fetters\r\nwithout forging new ones_. (Applause.) If to-morrow it were again\r\nnecessary, either for causes arising within or without the frontiers, to\r\nsound again the trumpet of war, I am sure that the Universities would\r\nagain empty themselves to re-populate the trenches. (Loud applause.)\r\n\r\nAnd now that you have rejuvenated me by twenty years, I would like to\r\nsing with you the “Gaudeamus Igitur.” After all, Lorenzino dei Medici\r\nwas right when he sang: “How beautiful is youth!” Well, my young\r\nfriends, there can never be for us as individuals the certainty of the\r\nmorrow, but there is the supreme and magnificent certainty of the morrow\r\nfor us as a nation and as a people.\r\n\r\nAnd with the students’ hymn, let us utter in Latin a simpler word,\r\n_Laboremus_. To work with dignity, with probity and with cheerfulness,\r\nto assault life with earnestness and to meet it as a mission, trying to\r\nfulfil the categorical injunction left us by our dead. They command us\r\nto obey and to serve, they command us discipline, sacrifice and\r\nobedience.\r\n\r\nWe should really be the last of men if we failed to do our clear duty.\r\nBut we shall not fail. I who hold the pulse of the nation and who\r\ncarefully count its beats, I who sometimes shudder in the face of the\r\nheavy responsibilities which I have assumed, feel in me a hope, nay a\r\nvibration, of a supreme certainty which is this: that, by the will of\r\nthe leaders, by the determination of the people, and by the sacrifice of\r\npast, present and future generations, Imperial Italy, the Italy of our\r\ndreams, will be for us the reality of to-morrow. (Loud applause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nITALY’S FOREIGN POLICY REGARDING GERMAN REPARATIONS, HUNGARY, BULGARIA,\r\n    AUSTRIA, YUGOSLAVIA, TURKEY, RUSSIA, POLAND AND OTHER COUNTRIES\r\n\r\n            Speech delivered at the Senate on 8th June 1923.\r\n\r\n\r\nHonourable Senators,—The speech that I have the honour of delivering\r\nbefore your illustrious Assembly may appear analytical, because in it I\r\npropose to touch on several questions and to speak decisively upon\r\nseveral problems, especially with regard to internal policy.[13] By this\r\nI do not delude myself to be able to convince those who are my opponents\r\nin _malâ fide_, nor to disperse completely the small opposition which\r\nnourishes itself on detail, and is the effect of personal temperament.\r\n\r\nFootnote 13:\r\n\r\n  The speech on Internal Policy here referred to will follow this one on\r\n  page 306.\r\n\r\nYou will not be surprised if I begin with foreign policy, even if it\r\nhappens that this is the field in which serious and founded opposition\r\ndoes not exist, and it may be legitimately said that our policy is\r\nendorsed unanimously by the nation.\r\n\r\nAs I have already said on other occasions, the foreign policy of the\r\npresent Government is inspired by the necessity for a progressive\r\nrevaluation of our diplomatic and political position in Europe and in\r\nthe world. It is a fact that, except for territorial acquisitions\r\nbounded by the Brenner and the Nevoso, frontiers wrested by long and\r\nbloody wars, Italy was excluded in the Peace of Versailles and other\r\nsuccessive treaties from all other benefits of an economic and colonial\r\nnature. Solemn pacts signed during the war have lapsed and have not been\r\nreplaced. The position of inferiority assigned to Italy has weighed and\r\nstill weighs heavily on the economic life of our people. It is useless\r\nto dwell upon recriminations of the past. We must rather seek to regain\r\nthe ground and time lost. There is no doubt that from October to to-day\r\nthe situation has notably improved.\r\n\r\nThe other Powers, whether allied or not, know that Italy intends to\r\nfollow an energetic and assiduous policy for the protection of her\r\nnatural and vital interests, intends to be present wherever, directly or\r\nindirectly, they are at stake, because this is her right and her\r\ndefinite duty; but at the same time she is in favour of that line of\r\nconduct in general policy which tends to bring back as quickly as\r\npossible to a normal state the economic situation of our continent.\r\nItaly, who too is marching rapidly towards her readjustment, sees this\r\nre-birth continually disturbed by general outside factors. There is,\r\ntherefore, a definite Italian interest in hastening the pacific solution\r\nof the European crisis.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Position of Italy and Reparations._ All such crises, since the\r\nTreaty of Versailles onwards, have been dominated by the one problem:\r\nReparations. In the face of this problem the fundamental position of\r\nItaly is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Germany can and must pay a sum which now seems universally fixed and\r\nwhich is very far from the many hundreds of milliards talked of on the\r\nmorrow of the Armistice;\r\n\r\n2. Italy could not tolerate territorial changes which would lead to a\r\npolitical, economic or military hegemony in Europe;\r\n\r\n3. Italy is prepared to bear her quota of sacrifice, if it is necessary\r\nto obtain what is called European reconstruction;\r\n\r\n4. The Italian Government maintains to-day more than ever, above all\r\nafter the last German Note, that the problem of reparations and that of\r\nInter-Allied debts are intimately connected and are in a certain sense\r\ninterdependent.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the occupation of the Ruhr has contributed to\r\nrender the crisis of the Ruhr extremely acute, and therefore to a\r\ncertain extent hastened a solution.\r\n\r\nIt will not be inopportune to recall, considering the rapidity of\r\nevents, that the French and Belgians went to the Ruhr on account of the\r\ndeclarations of a series of failures of the supplies in kind by Germany,\r\nadmitted also by England, at any rate as regards that of wood, and the\r\nfailure of the Conference of Paris.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly worth while to fix exactly in their essential lines the\r\nmain features of the Italian, English and German projects, in order to\r\nhave a picture of the situation as regards its agreements and\r\ndivergencies, and to see what conjectures we can form as to a possible\r\nsettlement. This will also serve to explain why Italy was not able to\r\naccept the Bonar Law scheme at Paris, and why she had to reject the\r\nrecent Cuno-Rosenberg Memorandum.\r\n\r\nThe Italian project reduced the German debt to fifty milliards of gold\r\nmarks, proposed a moratorium of two years, during which Germany would\r\ncontinue the supply of reparations in kind, accepted the distribution of\r\nGerman payments according to the quotas fixed at Spa, by which the\r\nItalian quota was put at five milliards of gold marks, fixed the payment\r\nof one part of the “C” bonds by means of the security given by the other\r\nex-enemy States, used the remainder of the “C” bonds to settle the debt\r\nto America, agreed to the taking of economic pledges as a guarantee of\r\nthe German payments, and finally, as regards the payments of the\r\nreparations owed by Austria, Bulgaria and Hungary, asked for a pledge\r\nfor the acceptance of the proposals which England had deferred putting\r\nforward—proposals, that is, of annulling those debts.\r\n\r\nThe Italian quota of reparations, which the Italian project fixed at\r\nfive milliards of gold marks, was thus reduced in the English project to\r\nless than half; whilst cancelling the bonds, it partly abolishes to our\r\ndetriment German solidary responsibility for minor ex-enemy debts and\r\nrendered impossible the execution of the agreement of March 1921, which\r\nensures important advantages to Italy upon the basis of the “C” bonds.\r\nThe larger percentage reserved on the seventeen milliards, representing\r\nthe interest of the moratorium capitalised to 1923, could not be used\r\nfor the payment of American debts, in consideration of the aleatory\r\nnature of these seventeen milliards.\r\n\r\nI do not recall all this to reopen discussions, but only to make clear\r\nthe main outlines of that which was and remains a noteworthy attempt to\r\nfind a solution for this grave problem; an attempt which contains worthy\r\nelements which can be usefully taken up again in case of a definite\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of an agreement between England and America on the\r\nproblem of debts—the work of the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr.\r\nBaldwin, to-day Prime Minister, followed shortly after the presentation\r\nof the English project.\r\n\r\nAny idea of this debt being itself cancelled, or even of a simple\r\ncompensation through the payment of reparations, is excluded from this\r\nagreement. The obligation to pay, although facilities may be accorded\r\nconcerning both the number of years in which it must take place and the\r\ninterests due, is solemnly affirmed and put into execution. In England\r\nthe Speech from the Throne strongly emphasised this agreement. Even\r\ntaking into account the diversity of economic strength and the totality\r\nof sacrifices borne, it could not remain without effect upon the\r\nimportance of the whole question for the other European Powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Analysis of the German Project._ If we compare the English and Italian\r\nprojects with the German, the inacceptability of the latter appears\r\nevident. As is known, one of the fundamental points of the last German\r\nproject concerns the consolidation of the actual debt of Germany,\r\nespecially in kind, at the figure of twenty milliard gold marks, with an\r\nadditional ten milliards, the payment of which depends upon the decision\r\nof an International Commission. Deducting the interest, these twenty\r\nmilliards are reduced to fifteen, and the sums necessary must be found\r\nby international loans; and in the very probable eventuality that by\r\n1927 the twenty milliards have not been subscribed, an annuity will be\r\npaid which represents five per cent. interest plus one per cent. for the\r\nredemption of the loan. Finally, in the German project any provision or\r\nregulation for the guarantees demanded is lacking. The total German\r\ndebt, which in the English and the Italian projects is fixed at the\r\nfigure of fifty milliards, in the German project is reduced to less than\r\na third, and it is difficult, if not impossible, to determine in it the\r\nItalian quota and the sacrifice demanded from Italy.\r\n\r\nIn view of the representations, especially of England and Italy, Germany\r\nhas recognised her proposals as insufficient, and yesterday the German\r\nAmbassador, Neurath, presented to me the new German Note, on the\r\ncontents and nature of which I cannot pronounce an opinion for evident\r\nreasons, as in consequence of this Note diplomatic action with all the\r\nAllies must be taken up. I will only say that the German Note no longer\r\ndemands the preliminary evacuation of the Ruhr as a condition for\r\nnegotiation. This might make us believe in a renunciation on the part of\r\nGermany of that passive resistance, the utility of which—even for German\r\naims—appears ever more doubtful, and whose cessation would help towards\r\na more rapid attainment of a solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Italy and Hungary._ But the problem of reparations is not only\r\nFranco-German, it is also Hungarian, Bulgarian and Austrian.\r\n\r\nIt is useful to define the stage which has been reached with regard to\r\nthese ex-enemy countries. The total of the Hungarian reparations, which\r\nis fixed by the Treaty of Trianon, has not yet been determined by the\r\nReparations Commission, and Hungary up to to-day has only furnished\r\nlimited supplies in kind. The Hungarian Government, alleging the\r\ndisturbed economic and financial conditions of the country caused by the\r\nserious depression of the krone, has recently put forward the necessity\r\nto contract a foreign loan, which, if it is to succeed, should be\r\nguaranteed by the custom duties, by the tobacco monopoly, and, if needs\r\nbe, by other resources. Hence arises the necessity for such resources to\r\nbe freed for an adequate period from the claims of reparations. A\r\nMemorandum precisely to this effect has been recently presented by the\r\nHungarian Minister in Paris to the Reparations Commission.\r\n\r\nThe Italian Government, having examined the question from a technical\r\npoint of view, has deemed it indispensable to concede to Hungary the\r\ntemporary relinquishment of certain resources, so that she may proceed\r\nto her own economic restoration by means of loans to be contracted\r\nabroad. Italy has, therefore, shown herself favourable to the above\r\nHungarian request, with the addition of certain conditions necessary to\r\nguarantee her own rights, on which point she is in agreement with the\r\nBritish Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Agreement with Bulgaria for Payment._ With reference to Bulgarian\r\nreparations, Italy, Great Britain and France came to an agreement on\r\n21st March with the Bulgarian Government to facilitate the payment of\r\nher debt of 2250 million gold francs fixed by the Treaty of Neuilly, by\r\ndividing it in two parts; one of 550 millions to be paid by instalments\r\nbeginning in October of this year, and the other 1700 millions not to be\r\nclaimed before thirty years.\r\n\r\nBulgaria has pledged herself by this agreement to reserve for the\r\nregulation of her debt the revenues of her customs and has already\r\npassed a law to this effect. The agreement has also been approved by the\r\nReparations Commission, with the reservation of our rights for the\r\nreimbursement of the expenses of the army of occupation. In fact,\r\nnegotiations are proceeding with the Bulgarian Government for the\r\nregulation of this credit, which enjoys the privilege of priority over\r\nother reparations.\r\n\r\nOur Government, animated by favourable dispositions as regards all that\r\nconcerns the settlement of obligations arising from the war, has had no\r\ndifficulty in accepting such an agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Loan to Austria._ Fulfilling the pledge taken by its predecessors\r\nin the Protocol of Geneva of 4th October 1922, the Italian Government\r\nhas co-operated with the Governments which are signatories of the\r\nProtocol, in order that the loan in favour of Austria should have a\r\nlarge and ready success. For this purpose the Government has consented\r\nto postpone for twenty years, which is the duration of the War Loan, her\r\ncredits against Austria for the recovery of damages and for bonds of\r\nfood supply, has given her own guarantee for twenty-five per cent. of a\r\nmaximum loan of 585 million gold kronen, and has authorised Italian\r\nbanks to contribute directly to the loan up to the maximum of 200\r\nmillion lire, including the sixty-eight which Italy had previously lent\r\nto Austria, and which, by the terms of the Protocol of Geneva, should\r\nhave been repaid in cash.\r\n\r\nPutting off for a further period the exaction of Austrian reparation,\r\nand giving a guarantee and a direct and substantial contribution to the\r\nloan in favour of Austria, the Italian Government has wished to offer\r\nher co-operation towards the political independence and territorial\r\nintegrity of the Austrian Republic to which the Protocol of Geneva\r\nrefers, and to which the United States of America also wish to\r\ncontribute, confidently subscribing for the first time to a European\r\nloan.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Relations between Italy and Yugoslavia._ Italy’s political line of\r\nconduct towards the States of the Little Entente and in general towards\r\nthe States recently created is substantially inspired by the necessity\r\nof exacting the respect and the scrupulous fulfilment of the treaties,\r\nbecause, given the present contingencies, only such a policy can produce\r\nquick and pleasing results with regard to an economic settlement of the\r\nDanubian States which would contribute to the larger one of Central\r\nEurope. On several occasions the friendly and moderate policy of Italy\r\nhas followed such a course with satisfactory results.\r\n\r\nWith reference to such a policy the relations between Italy and\r\nYugoslavia have a special importance. The clear attitude taken by the\r\nGovernment with regard to Yugoslavia by proceeding to the definite\r\nenforcement of the Treaty of Rapallo has strengthened our legal\r\nposition, and we are able to rest any further development of our policy\r\non a solid basis. The enforcement of the Agreements of Santa Margherita,\r\nwhich has been necessarily laborious owing to the large extent of the\r\nfield covered, can be said, however, to proceed on the whole\r\nsatisfactorily. In spite of the initial difficulties encountered in any\r\nexceptional régime, the economic system of the so-called “special zone\r\nof Zara” is already in force for the evacuation of the remaining\r\nDalmatian territories, and the various organisations for the regulation\r\nof all the intricate questions arising out of the Agreements have been\r\nconstituted.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fiume._ But naturally the most important question to solve is that of\r\nFiume. As is known, it offers the gravest difficulties, since, in order\r\nto ensure the future of the commercial life of the town, there must be\r\nsolved many complex problems of an economic nature which are often in\r\nopposition to those of a political character. Undoubtedly the recent\r\nlong Parliamentary crisis in Yugoslavia, which for a considerable time\r\nforced the Government of Belgrade to confine its attentions almost\r\nexclusively to internal problems, has heavily weighed against the\r\nrapidity of the solution of such a question.\r\n\r\nThat Government has repeatedly acquainted us with its wishes to solve\r\nthe question in a satisfactory way as regards the sentiments and the\r\ninterests of Italy, and has also frankly made known to us the real\r\ndifficulties with which the Government is faced in asking the\r\npopulations interested to accept a solution in agreement with the\r\nItalian point of view.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Italo-Yugoslav Commission._ With a view to ensure an atmosphere of\r\ngreater quiet to the Italo-Yugoslav Commission, the Government of\r\nBelgrade has, in the meantime, agreed to transfer the seat of the\r\nCommission to Rome. The Yugoslav Delegation has arrived, and between it\r\nand the Italian Delegation, which is fulfilling its duty with a high\r\nsense of patriotism and political probity, preliminary meetings are\r\ntaking place with the object of fixing certain fundamental points before\r\nresuming official discussions, so that the latter may proceed with the\r\nnecessary speed without lapsing into a deplorable stagnation, which\r\nwould be otherwise inevitable in such an arduous task.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Conference of Lausanne and the definite Cession of Castelrosso to\r\nItaly._ The Conference of Lausanne, which after the well-known\r\nsuspension of last February resumed its proceedings on 23rd April, is\r\nslowly completing them through the no small difficulties of various\r\nkinds caused by the delicacy and complexity of the questions under\r\nexamination. The course followed by the Italian Delegation under any\r\ncircumstance has always been inspired by the most calm and impartial\r\nattitude, and its efficacy has been recognised and generally appreciated\r\nat its just worth.\r\n\r\nItaly cannot help considering as her vital interests the speedy\r\nrestoration of a normal state of trade in the East, as well as the\r\neconomic development and general progress of all the peoples living on\r\nthe shore of the Eastern Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nAlthough all the questions under discussion have not yet been solved at\r\nLausanne, on some of them, however, which more directly affect our\r\ncountry, an agreement, satisfactory on the whole, has been reached. The\r\nGovernment of Angora has explicitly withdrawn the objection regarding\r\nthe cession of the island of Castelrosso to Italy, the possession of\r\nwhich on our part could in no way justify an eventual suspicion of\r\nItalian aggressive aims with regard to Turkey. Our flag, which has\r\nalready been saluted from the moment it appeared in the island as a\r\nsymbol of peaceful well-being, will in the future continue to protect a\r\npopulation which by plebiscite has entrusted itself to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Juridical Protection of Foreigners in Turkey._ The Italian\r\nGovernment has also obtained the cancellation of those clauses, with\r\nregard to our colonies in North Africa, which the agreements concluded\r\nafter the Libyan War had left in existence, and at the same time the\r\ninterests of Libyan subjects residing in Turkey, whose rights have been\r\nequal to those of Italian citizens, were opportunely protected.\r\n\r\nFrom the opening of the Conference the question of the juridical\r\nprotection of foreigners has been of the greatest importance. The\r\nConference has agreed in fixing the limits of such protection, including\r\nit in a formula which establishes for a period of five years the\r\nappointment on the part of the Turkish Government of foreign judges, who\r\nare authorised to receive complaints of the sentences and of the\r\nproceedings of Turkish magistrates.\r\n\r\nAt Lausanne there still remain under discussion certain important\r\nquestions of general interest, such as those relative to the management\r\nof the Ottoman Public Debt and others of an economic nature, which I\r\nhope may be quickly solved.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Relations between Italy and Russia._ The present relations with Russia\r\nare regulated by the Italo-Russian and Italo-Ukraine Agreements of 26th\r\nDecember 1921. A few days ago the projects for the conversion into law\r\nof the Royal Decree of 31st January 1922 were presented to Parliament,\r\nby whom the said agreements had been approved, though some opposition\r\nhad been offered to their practical application. This opposition gave\r\nthe Russians a pretext for violating the agreement. We mean to remove\r\nthese obstacles in order to render easier the economic relations between\r\nthe two countries and pave the way for an understanding resting on a\r\nwider basis without excessive illusions, but also without dangerous\r\nprejudices.\r\n\r\nRelations between the two countries, which possess different economic\r\nsystems, present enormous difficulties. They are, however, not\r\nunsurmountable if on both sides there is a good-will to overcome them.\r\nItalian policy towards Russia is clear and cannot give rise to\r\nmisunderstanding.\r\n\r\nThe presentation before Parliament of these decrees represents another\r\nproof of our intentions and gives us the right to expect from the\r\nGovernment of Moscow the scrupulous fulfilment of the pacts, the\r\nexecution of the pledge taken to abstain from any act hostile to our\r\nGovernment, and from whatsoever direct or indirect propaganda against\r\nthe institutions of the kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Relations between Italy and the United States._ I do not think it is\r\nnecessary, considering the brevity of this speech, to enter into further\r\ndetail. I will only say that the relations between the United States and\r\nItaly are particularly cordial, and I am glad to add that both the\r\nGovernment and the American people have fully understood the new\r\npolitical situation in Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Relations with Poland and other Countries._ The initiative of Italy for\r\nthe definite determination of the Polish frontiers has cemented even\r\nmore closely the bonds of cordial friendship which have united the two\r\ncountries for centuries. Their collaboration continues to be\r\nstrengthened on economic as well as on political grounds. In these last\r\ndays the Polish Government has placed important orders with Italian\r\nmanufacturers.\r\n\r\nThe conversations and the personal relations I have had with the\r\nMinisters of Austria, of Roumania, of Hungary, the recent journey of\r\nH.M. the King of England, the commercial treaties concluded and to be\r\nconcluded, are other signs of that progressive revaluation of our\r\ndiplomatic position which I referred to at the beginning of this speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Improvement of the Diplomatic and Consular Services._ The Fascista\r\nGovernment, always with the object of this revaluation, as soon as it\r\ncame into power instructed its representatives abroad to direct their\r\npolicy outside the confines of the country to the renewed life of Italy,\r\nand to face immediately the problem of the means and the men for that\r\nend. In fact, the administration of Foreign Affairs, in the face of so\r\nmany difficulties from outside, already possessed a great difficulty in\r\nher own constitution, due to the scanty number of its elements. The\r\ntools of our work, which is so delicate abroad, had to be renewed, and\r\nrendered suitable, as regards the increase in number of officials and\r\nthe new conditions of Italy, for the momentous task which they are\r\nrequired to perform.\r\n\r\nInstructions have, therefore, been given with effect from the first days\r\nof November for the reorganisation of the competition for the Diplomatic\r\nand Consular Services, and for Interpreters.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I wish to repeat that Italian foreign policy, while it\r\nintends to safeguard national interests, wants at the same time to\r\nconstitute a factor of equilibrium and peace in Europe, and by such a\r\npolicy I think I interpret the tendencies and the needs of the Italian\r\npeople. (Applause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         “THE INTERNAL POLICY”\r\n\r\n   Speech delivered at the Senate on 8th June 1923, after the one on\r\n                      Foreign Policy (see p. 293).\r\n\r\n\r\nHonourable Senators,—The problems of public order are problems of the\r\nauthority of the State. There is no real authority in the State if\r\npublic order is not perfectly normal. Public order and authority of the\r\nState are, therefore, two aspects of the same problem. I ask you if\r\nconditions have improved or become worse since last October.\r\n(“Improved!”) Some of you give an affirmative answer. I, too, say they\r\nhave improved. Although, naturally, I am far from being pessimistic and,\r\ntherefore, from being discontented, I feel that nothing ever goes well\r\nenough. But, Gentlemen, when one speaks of public order, one must make\r\ncomparisons. Even if they are disagreeable, they are necessary. Unrest,\r\nuneasiness and sedition are phenomena to be found not only in Italy. If\r\nwe glance beyond our frontiers we have reason to repeat that, if Messene\r\nweeps, Sparta does not laugh! Look at the vanquished peoples and note\r\nwhat happens in Austria and in Germany. Look at the victorious peoples\r\nand you will see that only yesterday there was a strike of public\r\nofficials in Belgium, which has cost the Treasury hundreds of millions\r\nof francs. If, then, you glance at the neutral countries, at Spain, you\r\nwill find there, too, that life is not excessively bright and easy. All\r\nthis I say for those who, at every small revolver shot fired in one of\r\nthe twenty thousand villages of Italy, think they have been wounded by a\r\n17–inch shell!\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Significant Comparison._ But, above all, it is worth while to look at\r\nItaly and consider, on one side, her conditions in the years 1918–20 and\r\nin the period following 1920–21. The dominating events of the former two\r\nyears are the occupation of the factories, the permanent strike of the\r\nofficials belonging to public organisations, carried out in rotation,\r\nand by a displacement of all the powers of State authority (Assent.);\r\nand, although the incident is extremely painful, one must recall to mind\r\nthat in the rank and file of that same glorious army of ours occurred an\r\nepisode at Ancona which proves how deeply sedition had worked its way\r\ninto the body of the Italian State.\r\n\r\nThe dominating event of the following two years is the punitive Fascista\r\nexpedition. Fascisti, from sheer necessity, went out to the assault of\r\nthe towns in large armed bodies. To-day all this is over. To-day the\r\nofficials of public organisations do not and will not strike. (Assent.)\r\nWhen the Fascista employees of the Post and Telegraph Offices came to me\r\nto protest because my colleague, the Hon. Colonna di Cesaro, had\r\npunished them, I told them that if I had been Minister of Post and\r\nTelegraphs I should have punished them twice, and I added that, just\r\nbecause they were Fascisti, they would have to recognise the necessity\r\nfor a strict discipline. (Assent.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_The State renewed._ The conditions of public order reached their zenith\r\nof disintegration during the latter part of the year. In August there\r\nwas the anti-Fascista strike, which completely paralysed the State. This\r\nhad no effect; the Fascista forces, in its stead, obtained success. And,\r\nfrom that time, I said that the two must be made one, and that since\r\nthat State was destitute of all the attributes of virility, while there\r\nwas a State in power which was rising with great strength and capable of\r\nimposing discipline on the nation, it was indispensable for the rising\r\nState to substitute itself, by a revolutionary movement, for the other\r\nState which was declining. The August anti-Fascista strike was followed\r\nby the Fascista occupation of the towns of Bologna and Bolzano. The\r\nauthority of the State was a complete ruin. There are no more reports of\r\nlabour conflicts in the papers now.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Chamber and the Conflicts._ I am sufficiently impartial to say that\r\nin these last days there has been a slight recrudescence of trouble.\r\nWhat is its cause? I tell you quite frankly: the reopening of the\r\nChamber. (Laughter.) The Chamber is the place of questions. By the\r\nspectacle it offers to the nation it sows seeds of conflict and discord\r\namongst the impulsive and excitable masses.\r\n\r\nFurther, the attitude of a section of Italian Liberalism is a very\r\nwelcome piece of good fortune for the subversive elements, because they\r\nconstitute for them unhoped-for, unexpected allies, who blow enormous\r\nbubbles, which I promise myself to prick with the pin of logic and\r\nsincerity before closing my speech. (Assent.) Then perhaps there is\r\nthis, that certain gentlemen, when they found out that they had not to\r\nfear the law of Fascismo or that of the Government, which is slower\r\nbecause it is bound to move in accordance with legal procedure, resumed\r\ntheir bold attitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Elimination of the Subversive Elements._ The measures adopted to\r\nrestore public order are: First of all the elimination of the so-called\r\nsubversive elements. There was much clamour after the hauling in of the\r\nnets, but in reality it was only a very small affair. Of two thousand\r\nwho were arrested, those who are still in gaol do not reach the figure\r\nof one hundred and fifty. They are in the hands of the judges. They were\r\nelements of disorder and subversion. On the morrow of each conflict I\r\ngave the categorical order to confiscate the largest possible number of\r\nweapons of every sort and kind. This confiscation, which continues with\r\nthe utmost energy, has given satisfactory results. (Assent.) I had to\r\nrepress every illegal act.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The High Grades of the National Militia._ There was another problem\r\nwith regard to the National Militia: namely the necessity of filling the\r\nsuperior posts, to which had to be appointed men coming from the army\r\nwith a large personal military experience; this necessity had to be\r\nharmonised with the gratitude due to the small heads of Fascista\r\n“squadrismo,” the body which, by leaving thousands of glorious dead, had\r\ncrushed the subversive demagogic elements.\r\n\r\nWe have solved this problem. All the ranks of superior officers above\r\nthose of “Seniore” have been assigned to the officers coming from the\r\nregular army; all the inferior grades and those of sub-officers have\r\nbeen given to military men, to “squadristi” who had previously seen\r\nmilitary life.\r\n\r\nMoreover, statistics are always worth more than speeches. Ninety-seven\r\nper cent. of the officers of the Militia having a rank superior to that\r\nof “Seniore” come from the officers of the regular army. Out of about\r\ntwo hundred and thirty officers superior to the rank of “Seniore,” six\r\nare decorated with the Military Order of Savoy, two with Gold Medals,\r\none hundred and thirty with Silver Medals, eighty with Bronze Medals.\r\n\r\nAs this is a day of explanations, even at the risk of abusing your\r\npatience, I must read the list of rewards bestowed on the Chiefs of the\r\nNational Militia. _General Cesare De Bono_, Field Marshal of the regular\r\narmy: three Silver Medals, special promotion for war services, “Croce di\r\nGuerra.” _General Gandolfo_, Field Marshal of the regular army: two\r\nSilver Medals, special promotion for war services. _Hon. Cesare Maria De\r\nVecchi_: four Silver Medals, two Bronze Medals, two “Croci di Guerra.”\r\n_Italo Balbo_: one Silver Medal, one “Croce di Guerra.” _Gustavo Fara_,\r\nthe general well known through all Italy: one Gold Medal, two Silver\r\nMedals, special promotions for war services. _Stringa_, Major-General of\r\nthe regular army: three Silver Medals, one Bronze Medal, disabled in the\r\nwar. _Ozol Clemente_, Major-General in the regular army: two Silver\r\nMedals, “Croce di Guerra.” _Ceccherini_, Major-General in the regular\r\narmy: three Silver Medals, two Bronze Medals. _Zambon_, Major-General of\r\nthe regular army: Silver Medal and Bronze Medal. _Guglielmotti_,\r\nMajor-General of the regular army: two Silver Medals.\r\n\r\nAfter these follow:\r\n\r\n_Giuriati_, with two Silver Medals; _Acerbo_, with three Silver Medals\r\n(voices: “Bravo!”); _Caradonna_, with three Silver Medals; _Finzi_, with\r\na Silver Medal and two “Croci di Guerra.”\r\n\r\nNot to embarrass the modesty of my friends, I shall not continue to read\r\nthe list of these officers of the National Militia,—(Laughter.)—but this\r\nis enough to prove to you that this is a serious institution. And I add\r\nthat every day it becomes more so, because I mean that it shall be so,\r\nbecause all its chiefs mean it.\r\n\r\nIt might be asked of us: “Why does the Militia remain?” I shall tell it\r\nto you at once: for a very simple reason, to defend Fascismo at home and\r\nalso abroad. The word “abroad” might alarm you. Well, I tell you that\r\nabroad there is a difficult atmosphere for Italian Fascismo. Difficult\r\nfor the parties of the Right, which, being formed of national elements,\r\ncannot feel enthusiasm for a movement that exalts our national\r\nqualities; difficult for the parties of the Left, because those elements\r\nare our adversaries from the social point of view, knowing that the\r\nFascista movement is clearly anti-Socialist. It is well, therefore, that\r\nit should be known that there is in Italy a mighty army of volunteers to\r\ndefend that special form of political organisation called Fascismo.\r\n\r\nThe Militia, moreover, has the object of enabling the army to do its own\r\nwork. The army must fight, must get ready for war. It must not do police\r\nwork, especially of a political nature, except under absolutely\r\nexceptional circumstances, of which now I do not wish to think, even\r\nhypothetically. As an example I can tell you that last night, upon my\r\npersonal instructions, a whole section of Leghorn was blockaded. Well,\r\none hundred carabineers and three hundred black shirts sufficed, whilst\r\nthe army, the official troops, were sleeping peacefully in their\r\nbarracks, as was their duty and their right. Moreover, believe me, so\r\nlong as in Italy they know that, besides some tens of thousands of\r\nfaithful carabineers, there is this enormous force, attempts at revolt\r\nor at sedition will never be dared.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Modifications to the Statute Law._ Finally, and this is a manœuvre of\r\nthe last few days, have burst forth in Italy the bold defenders of the\r\nStatute, of Liberty and of Parliament. (Laughter.) It seems, listening\r\nto these gentlemen, who had for a long time forgotten the existence of\r\nthe Statute, even as a simple historical document,—(Laughter.)—that the\r\nStatute runs a serious risk and that one cannot even discuss nor examine\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWell, I think that none of you can consider Camillo Cavour as a\r\nBolshevist and a Fascista of 1848. Everybody knows that the\r\nConstitutional movement of Piedmont was the work of Cavour. Everybody\r\nknows how the political Constitution was granted. At Genoa a tumult\r\narose against the Jesuits, believed supporters of Absolutism. A\r\nCommission of Genoese went to Turin and asked for the expulsion of the\r\nJesuits and the calling out of the Civic Guard. But Cavour answered:\r\n“This is too little, the times are ripe for something more!” Cavour\r\nwrote in his paper, _Il Risorgimento_: “The Constitution must be\r\ndemanded.” And this was promulgated on the 4th of March. In its preamble\r\nit says: “The Statute is the fundamental, perpetual law of the\r\nMonarchy.” Four days afterwards the first Constitutional Ministry of\r\nCoalition was formed with the Moderate Balbo and the Democratic Pareto.\r\n\r\nThe phrase “The Statute is the fundamental, perpetual and irrevocable\r\nlaw of the Monarchy” had wounded the ears of the Democrats. Cavour\r\nhastened to interpret it in a relative sense. It is worth while to\r\nlisten attentively to this paragraph of Cavour. “How is it possible,” he\r\nsaid, “how can it be expected that the legislator would have wished to\r\npledge himself and the nation not to make the slightest direct change,\r\nto bring the smallest improvement to a political law? But this would\r\nmean the removal from the community of the power of revising the\r\nConstitution; it would mean the deprival of the indispensable power of\r\nmodifying its political form according to new social exigencies; this\r\nwould be such an absurd idea that no one of those who co-operated in the\r\nmaking of this fundamental law could conceive it. A nation cannot\r\nrenounce the power of changing by legal means its common law.”\r\n\r\nAfter a short time history had to register a first violation of the\r\nStatute, which assumed or presumed that, in order to become a member of\r\nParliament, it was necessary to be an Italian citizen. On the 16th of\r\nOctober there was a division between the Right, amongst which there were\r\nthe Moderates and the Municipals, and the Left, to which belonged the\r\nDemocrats, called the “burnt heads,” and the Republicans. On the\r\nfollowing day these two parties were agreed in unanimously proclaiming\r\nabove the Statute that all Italians could belong to the Subalpine\r\nParliament. The first to benefit by this violation of the Statute was\r\nAlessandro Manzoni; but he declined the mandate by a letter which\r\nrepresents a fine example of correctness and political probity.\r\n(Approval.)\r\n\r\nNobody, Gentlemen, wishes to overthrow or destroy the Statute, which\r\nrests solidly on firm foundations; but the inhabitants of this building\r\nfrom 1848 up to to-day have changed. There are other exigencies, other\r\nneeds. There is no longer the Piedmontese Italy of 1848! And it is very\r\nstrange to notice among the defenders of the Statute those who have\r\nviolated it in its fundamental laws, those who have curtailed the\r\nprerogatives of the Crown, those who wanted the Crown to be entirely\r\noutside the politics of the nation, and to become a dead institution.\r\n(Loud applause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Abolition of Parliament?_ They say that this Government does not\r\nlike the Chamber of Deputies. (Comments.) They say that we want to\r\nabolish Parliament and deprive it of all its essential attributes. It is\r\ntimely to say that the collapse of Parliament is not desired by me, nor\r\nby those who follow my ideas. Parliamentarism has been severely affected\r\nby two phenomena typical of our days: on one side Syndicalism, on the\r\nother Journalism. Syndicalism gathers by its various organisations all\r\nthose who have special interests to protect, who wish to withdraw them\r\nfrom the manifest incompetence of the political Assembly. Journalism\r\nrepresents the daily Parliament, the daily platform where men coming\r\nfrom the Universities, from Science, Industry, from the experience of\r\nlife itself, dissect problems with a competence that is very seldom\r\nfound on the Parliamentary benches.\r\n\r\nThese two phenomena typical of the last period of capitalist\r\ncivilisation are those which have reduced the enormous importance which\r\nwas attributed to Parliament. To sum up, Parliament can no longer\r\ncontain all the life of the nations, because modern life is\r\nexceptionally complicated and difficult.\r\n\r\nBut this does not mean that we wish to abolish Parliament. We wish\r\nrather to improve it, to make it more perfect, make it a serious, if\r\npossible a solemn institution. In fact, if I had wished to abolish\r\nParliament, I would not have introduced an Electoral Reform Bill. This\r\nBill logically presupposes the elections, and through these elections\r\nthere will be deputies—(Laughter.)—who will form Parliament. In 1924,\r\ntherefore, there will be a Parliament.\r\n\r\nBut must the Government be towed along by Parliament? Must it be at the\r\nmercy of Parliament? Must it be without a will, or a head before\r\nParliament? I cannot admit that.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Great Fascista Council._ They say that Fascismo has created\r\nduplicate institutions. These duplicates do not exist. The Great\r\nFascista Council is not a duplicate of the Council of Ministers or above\r\nit. It met four times and never dealt with problems which concerned the\r\nCouncil of Ministers. With what, then, did the Great Fascista Council\r\ndeal? In the February meeting it devoted itself to the National Militia\r\nand Freemasonry; it paid a tribute to the Dalmatians and to the people\r\nof Fiume, and dealt with Fascismo abroad. In the March meeting it\r\narranged the ceremony for the anniversary of the foundation of Rome and\r\ndealt with Syndicalism. In its fourth meeting it devoted itself to the\r\nCongress of Turin and again to Syndicalism.\r\n\r\nAll the great problems dealing with State administration, with the\r\nreorganisation of armed forces, with the reform of our judiciary\r\ncircuits, with the reform of the schools, all the measures of a\r\nfinancial nature have been adopted directly by the responsible body, the\r\nCouncil of Ministers.\r\n\r\nAnd then what is the Great Fascista Council? It is the organ of\r\nco-ordination between the responsible forces of the Government and those\r\nof Fascismo. Among all the organisations created after the October\r\nrevolution, the Great Fascista Council is the most characteristic, the\r\nmost useful, the most efficient. I have abolished the High\r\nCommissioners, because they duplicated the Prefects and also embarrassed\r\nthe authority of the latter, who alone have the right to wield\r\nauthority. But I could never think of abolishing the Great Fascista\r\nCouncil, not even if to-morrow by chance the Council of Ministers were\r\ncomposed entirely of Fascisti.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Our Magnanimity must not be taken advantage of!_ This Government, which\r\nis depicted as hostile to liberty, has been perhaps too generous. The\r\nOctober revolution has not been bloodless for us; we have left dozens\r\nand dozens of dead. And who would have prevented us from doing in those\r\ndays that which all revolutions have done, from freeing ourselves once\r\nfor all from those who, taking advantage of our magnanimity, now render\r\nour task difficult? Only the Socialists of the newspaper _La Giustizia_,\r\nof Milan, have had the courage to recognise that if they still exist\r\nthey owe it to us, who did not wish that, in the first moments of “The\r\nMarch on Rome,” the “black shirts” should be stained with Italian blood.\r\nBut _our generosity_ must not be taken advantage of!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nobody must hope for a Crisis in Fascismo. The Membership of Fascismo._\r\nBut nobody must hope for a crisis in Fascismo, which is and will remain\r\nsimply a formidable party. If you happen to notice that in one of its\r\ninnumerable sections in Italy there is dissension, do not thus draw the\r\nconclusion that Fascismo is in a state of crisis. When a party holds the\r\nGovernment in its hands it holds it, if it wishes to hold it, because it\r\npossesses formidable forces to use to consolidate its power with\r\nincreasing strength. Fascismo is a Syndicalist movement which includes\r\none million and a half of workmen and _contadini_, who, I must say in\r\ntheir praise, are those who give me no trouble. There is, moreover, a\r\npolitical body which has 550,000 members, and I have asked to be\r\nrelieved of at least 150,000 of these gentlemen. (Laughter.) There is,\r\nstill, a military section of 300,000 “black shirts,” who are only\r\nwaiting to be called. These bodies are all united by a kind of moral\r\ncement, which might be called mystic and holy, and through which, by\r\ntouching certain keys, we would hear to-morrow the sounds of certain\r\ntrumpets!\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Associations which are included in Fascismo._ They ask us: “Will\r\nyou then camp out in Italy as an army of enemies which oppress the\r\nremainder of the population?” Here we have the philosophy of force by\r\nconsent. In the meanwhile I have the pleasure to announce that imposing\r\nmasses of men who deserve all the respect of the nation have joined\r\nFascismo, such as the Association of the Maimed and the Disabled, the\r\nNational Association of Ex-soldiers. In the wake of Fascismo, moreover,\r\nare also included the families of the fallen in war. There are a great\r\nmany members coming from the people in these three Associations, whilst\r\nthere is a great solidarity amongst these disabled ex-soldiers and\r\nfamilies of the fallen in war. They represent millions of people, and,\r\nin the face of this collaboration, must I go and simply seek all the\r\nfragments, all the relics of the old traditional parties? Must I sell my\r\nspiritual birthright for a mess of pottage which might be offered to me\r\nby those who have followed no one in the country? (Loud assent.) No! I\r\nshall never do this.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Collaboration I welcome._ If there is anybody who wishes to\r\ncollaborate with me, I welcome him to my house. But if this collaborator\r\nhas the air of a controlling inquisitor, or of the expectant heir, or of\r\nthe man who lies in ambush, with the object of being able at a given\r\nmoment to record my mistakes, then I declare that I do not want to have\r\nanything to do with this collaboration. (Bravo!)\r\n\r\nBesides, there is a moral force in all this. What was the cause after\r\nall which affected Italian life in past years? Italy was passing through\r\na transformation. There were never definite limits. Nobody had the\r\ncourage to be what he should have been.\r\n\r\nThere was the bourgeois who had Socialistic airs, there was the\r\nSocialist who had become a bourgeois up to his finger tips. The whole\r\natmosphere was made up of half tones of uncertainty. Well, Fascismo\r\nseizes individuals by their necks and tells them: “You must be what you\r\nare. If you are a bourgeois you must remain such. You must be proud of\r\nyour class, because it has given a type to the activity of the world in\r\nthe nineteenth century. (Approval.) If you are a Socialist you must\r\nremain such, although facing the inevitable risk you run in that\r\nprofession.” (Laughter.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Taxation and the Discipline of the Italian Population._ The sight which\r\nto-day the nation offers is satisfactory, because the Government\r\nexercises a stern and, if you like to say so, a cruel policy. It is\r\ncompelled to dismiss by thousands its officials, judges, officers,\r\nrailway men, dock-workers; and each dismissal represents a cause of\r\ntrouble, of distress, of unrest to thousands of families. The Government\r\nhas been compelled to levy taxes which unavoidably hit large sections of\r\nthe population. The Italian people are disciplined, silent and calm,\r\nthey work and know that there is a Government which governs, and know,\r\nabove all, that if this Government hits cruelly certain sections of the\r\nItalian people, it does not do so out of caprice, but from the supreme\r\nnecessity of national order.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Government is One._ Above this mass of people there are the\r\nrestless groups of practising politicians. We must speak plainly. In\r\nItaly there were several Governments which, before the present one,\r\nalways trembled before the journalist, the banker, the grand master of\r\nFreemasonry, before the head of the Popular Party, who remains more or\r\nless in the background,—(Applause.)—and it was enough for one of these\r\nministers _in partibus_ to knock at the door of the Government, for the\r\nGovernment to be struck by sudden paralysis. Well, all this is over!\r\nMany men gave themselves airs with the old Governments; those I have not\r\nreceived, but have reduced them to tears. (Assent.) For the Government\r\nis one. It knows no other Government outside its own and watches\r\nattentively, because one must not sleep when one governs, one must not\r\nneglect facts, one must keep before one’s eyes all the panorama, notice\r\nall the composition and decomposition, the changes of parties and of\r\nmen. Sometimes it is necessary, as a tactical measure, to be\r\ncircumspect; but political strategy, at least mine, is intransigent and\r\nabsolute.\r\n\r\n\r\n_My only Ambition is to make the Italian People Strong, Prosperous,\r\nGreat and Free._ I should have finished; in fact I have finished, but I\r\nmust still add something that concerns me a little personally. I do not\r\ndeny to citizens what one might call the “Jus murmurandi”—the right of\r\ngrumbling. (Laughter.) But one must not exaggerate, nor raise bogies,\r\nnor have one’s ears always open to dangers which do not exist. And,\r\nbelieve me, I do not get drunk with greatness. I would like, if it were\r\npossible, to get drunk with humility. (Approval.) I am content simply to\r\nbe a Minister, nor have I ambitions which surpass the clearly defined\r\nsphere of my duties and of my responsibilities. And yet I, too, have an\r\nambition. The more I know the Italian people, the more I bow before it.\r\n(Assent.) The more I come into deeper touch with the masses of the\r\nItalian people, the more I feel that they are really worthy of the\r\nrespect of all the representatives of the nation. (Assent.) My ambition,\r\nHonourable Senators, is only one. For this it does not matter if I work\r\nfourteen or sixteen hours a day. And it would not matter if I lost my\r\nlife, and I should not consider it a greater sacrifice than is due. My\r\nambition is this: I wish to make the Italian people strong, prosperous,\r\ngreat and free! (The end of the speech is hailed by a frantic and\r\ndelirious ovation. All the Senators rise, and the Tribune applauds\r\nloudly, whilst the great majority of the Senators go to congratulate the\r\nHon. Mussolini.)\r\n\r\n(The sitting is adjourned.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  “AS SARDINIA HAS BEEN GREAT IN WAR, SO LIKEWISE WILL SHE BE GREAT IN\r\n                                 PEACE”\r\n\r\n Speech delivered from the Palazzo della Prefettura at Sassari (Sardinia)\r\n                            on 10th June 1923.\r\n\r\n\r\nCitizens of Sassari! Proud people of Sardinia! The journey which I have\r\nmade to-day is not, and should not be interpreted as, a Ministerial\r\ntour. I intended to make a pilgrimage of devotion and love to your\r\nmagnificent land.\r\n\r\nI have been told that, since 1870 to to-day, this is the first time that\r\nthe head of the Government addresses the people of Sassari assembled in\r\nthis vast square. I deplore the fact that up to this day no Prime\r\nMinister, no Minister, has felt the elementary duty of coming here to\r\nget to know you, your needs, to come and express to you how much Italy\r\nowes you! (Applause.)\r\n\r\nFor months, for years, during the long years of our bloody sacrifice and\r\nof our sacred glory, the name of Sassari, consecrated to history by the\r\nbulletins of war, has echoed in the soul of all Italy. Those who\r\nfollowed the magnificent effort of our race, those who steeped\r\nthemselves in the filth of the trenches, young men of my\r\ngeneration—proud and disdainful of death—all those who bear in their\r\nheart the faith of their country, all those, O men of the Sassari\r\nBrigade, O citizens of Sassari, pay you tribute of a sign, of a\r\ntestimony of infinite love. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nWhat does it matter if some lazy bureaucrat has not yet taken into\r\naccount your needs? Sassari has already passed gloriously into history.\r\nI was grieved to-day when I was told that this town has no water. It is\r\nvery sad that a city of heroes has to endure thirst. Well! I promise you\r\nthat you will have water; you have the right to have it. (Applause.) If\r\nthe National Government grants to you, as it will grant, the three or\r\nfour millions necessary for this purpose, it will only have accomplished\r\nits duty, because while elsewhere young men with broad shoulders worked\r\nat the lathe, the people of Sardinia fought and died in the trenches.\r\n\r\nWe intend to raise up again the towns and all the land, because he who\r\nhas contributed to the war is more entitled to receive in peace.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, on the anniversary of the war, I went by aeroplane to\r\nthe cemeteries of the Carso. There are many of your brothers who sleep\r\nin those cemeteries the sleep which knows no awakening. I have known\r\nthem, I have lived with them, I have suffered with them. They were\r\nmagnificent, long-suffering, they did not complain, they endured, and\r\nwhen the tragic hour came for them to advance from the trenches they\r\nwere the first and never asked why. (Loud applause.)\r\n\r\nThe National Government which I have the honour to direct is a\r\nGovernment which counts upon you, and you can count upon it. It is a\r\nGovernment sprung forth from a double victory of the people. It cannot,\r\ntherefore, be against the working classes. It comes to you so that you\r\nmay tell it frankly and loyally what are your needs. You have been\r\nforgotten and neglected for too long! In Rome they hardly knew of the\r\nexistence of Sardinia! But since the war has revealed you to Italy, all\r\nItalians must remember Sardinia, not only in words, but in deeds. (Loud\r\napplause.)\r\n\r\nI am delighted, I am deeply moved by the reception which you have given\r\nme. I have looked you well in the face, I have recognised that you are\r\nsuperb shoots of this Italian race which was great when other people\r\nwere not born, of this Italian race which three times gave our\r\ncivilisation to the barbarian world, of this Italian race which we wish\r\nto mould by all the struggles necessary for discipline, for work, for\r\nfaith. (Applause.)\r\n\r\n_I am sure that, as Sardinia has been great in war, so likewise will she\r\nbe great in peace._ I salute you, O magnificent sons of this rugged,\r\nferruginous, and so far forgotten island. I embrace all of you in\r\nspirit. It is not the head of the Government who speaks to you, it is\r\nthe brother, the fellow-soldier of the trenches. Shout then with me:\r\nLong live the King! Long live Italy! Long live Sardinia!\r\n\r\n(An enthusiastic ovation greeted the last words of Mussolini.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n “MEN PASS AWAY, MAYBE GOVERNMENTS TOO, BUT ITALY LIVES AND WILL NEVER\r\n                                  DIE”\r\n\r\n  Speech delivered at Cagliari (Sardinia) on 12th June 1923, from the\r\n                       Palazzo della Prefettura.\r\n\r\n\r\nCitizens! Black shirts! Chivalrous people of Cagliari! Of late I have\r\nvisited several towns, including those which belong to the place where I\r\nwas born. Well! I wish to tell you, and this is the truth, that no town\r\naccorded me the welcome you gave me to-day. I knew that the town of\r\nCagliari was peopled by men of strong passions, I knew that an ardent\r\nspirit of regeneration throbbed in your hearts. The cheers with which\r\nyou welcomed me, the crowd crammed into the Roman amphitheatre, all this\r\ntells me that here Fascismo has deep roots. I thank you, therefore,\r\nCitizens, from the depth of my heart.\r\n\r\nI have come to Sardinia not only to know your land, as forty-eight hours\r\nwould not be enough for that purpose, and still less would they be\r\nenough to examine closely your needs. I know them; statesmen have known\r\nthem for the last fifty years. Those needs are already before the\r\nnation, and if up to to-day they have not yet been solved, this is due\r\nto the fact that Rome was lacking that iron will for regeneration which\r\nis the pivot, the essence of the Fascista Government’s faith in the\r\nfuture of our country. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nPassing through your land, I have found here a living, throbbing limb of\r\nthe mother country. Truly this island of yours is the western bulwark of\r\nthe nation; is like a heart of Rome set in the midst of our sea. Amongst\r\nall the impressions I have received in coming here, one has struck my\r\nheart. I was told that Sardinia, for special local reasons, was\r\nrefractory to Fascismo. Here, too, there was another misunderstanding.\r\nBut from to-day the cohorts and the legions, the thousands of strong\r\n“black shirts,” the syndicates, the _fasci_, the whole youth of this\r\nisland is there to show that Fascismo, representing an irresistible\r\nmovement for the regeneration of the race, was bound to carry with it\r\nthis island where the Italian race is manifested so superbly.\r\n(Applause.)\r\n\r\nI salute you, Black shirts! We saw each other in Rome and the groups\r\ncoming from Sardinia were cheered in the capital. You bear in your\r\nhearts the faith which at a given moment drove thousands and thousands\r\nof Fascisti from all the cities, from all the villages of Italy, to\r\nRome. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nNobody can ever dream of wrenching from us the fruit of victory that we\r\nhave paid for by so much blood generously shed by youths who offered\r\ntheir lives in order to crush Italian Bolshevism. Thousands and\r\nthousands of those who suffered martyrdom in the trenches, who have\r\nresumed the struggle after the war was over, who have won—all those have\r\nploughed a furrow between the Italy of yesterday, of to-day and of\r\nto-morrow.\r\n\r\nCitizens of Cagliari! You must certainly play a part in this great\r\ndrama. You, undoubtedly, wish to live the life of our great national\r\ncommunity, of this our beloved Italy, of this adorable mother who is our\r\ndream, our hope, our faith, our conviction, because men pass away, maybe\r\nGovernments, too, but Italy lives and will never die! (Loud applause.)\r\n\r\nTo-day I have visited the marvellous works of the artificial Lake Tirso.\r\nThey are not only a glory to Sardinia, they represent a masterpiece of\r\nwhich the whole nation may be proud.\r\n\r\nI feel, almost by intuition, that Sardinia also, too long forgotten,\r\nperhaps too patient, Sardinia to-day marches hand in hand with the rest\r\nof Italy. Let us then salute each other, O Citizens!\r\n\r\nAfter this speech of mine, which was meant to be an act of devotion, a\r\nbond of union between us, let us salute each other by shouting: Long\r\nlive the King! (Cheers.) Long live Italy! (Cheers.) Long live Fascismo!\r\n(Loud cheers.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       “FASCISMO WILL BRING A COMPLETE REGENERATION TO YOUR LAND”\r\n\r\n Speech delivered at Iglesias (Sardinia), at the Palazzo Municipale, on\r\n                            13th June 1923.\r\n\r\n\r\nCitizens of Iglesias! Black shirts! Fascisti! Your welcome, so cordial\r\nand so enthusiastic, surpasses any expectation. Iglesias has really been\r\nthe cradle of Sardinian Fascismo. From here sprang the first groups of\r\nblack shirts; it was, therefore, my definite duty to come and get into\r\ntouch with you.\r\n\r\nYou deserve that the Government should remember you, as in this island\r\nthere is a large reserve of faith and ardent patriotism: I go back to\r\nRome with my heart overcome with emotion.\r\n\r\nSince Italy has been united this is the first time that the head of the\r\nGovernment is in direct touch with the people of Sardinia.\r\n\r\nOne thing only I regret, and that is that the shortness of my visit has\r\nnot given me an opportunity of seeing more of your beautiful land. But I\r\nformally pledge myself to come again and visit your towns and your\r\nvillages. As the head of the Government I am glad to have found myself\r\namongst industrious, quiet and truly patient people, who have been too\r\nlong forgotten, indeed almost considered as a far-away colony.\r\n\r\nIt is well it should be known that Sardinia is one of the first regions\r\nof Italy, and it should be known, too, that she gave the largest\r\ncontribution of lives to our glorious victory.\r\n\r\nAs the head of the Government I am glad to find myself among the heroic\r\nblack shirts and to have seen the splendid flourishing conditions of\r\nFascismo, which will bring a complete regeneration to your land.\r\n\r\nHere (said the Hon. Mussolini, putting his hand on the standard of\r\nIglesias, which was hoisted near him)—here is the standard, the symbol\r\nof pure faith. I kiss it with fervour, and with the same fervour I\r\nembrace you, O magnificent people of Sardinia. (Loud applause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n “AS WE HAVE REGAINED THE MASTERY OF THE AIR, WE DO NOT WANT THE SEA TO\r\n                              IMPRISON US”\r\n\r\n Speech delivered at Florence from the balcony of the Palazzo Vecchio, on\r\n                             19th June 1923.\r\n\r\n\r\nBlack shirts of Florence and Tuscany! Fascisti! People! Where shall I\r\nfind the necessary words to express the fullness of my feelings at this\r\nmoment? My words cannot but be inadequate for the purpose. Your solemn,\r\nenthusiastic welcome stirs me to the depths of my heart. But it is\r\ncertain that it is not only to me that you pay this extraordinary\r\nhonour, but also, I think, to the idea of which I have been the\r\ninflexible protagonist.\r\n\r\nFlorence reminds me of the days when we were few. (Deafening applause.)\r\nHere we held the first glorious meeting of the Italian “Fasci di\r\nCombattimento.” You remember, we had often to interrupt our meeting to\r\ngo out and drive away the base rabble. (“Bravo!” Frantic applause.) We\r\nwere few then! Well, in spite of this huge crowd here assembled, I say\r\nthat we are still few, not with regard to the enemies who have been put\r\nto flight for ever, but with regard to the enormous tasks that lie\r\nbefore our Italy. (Applause.) I said that our enemies have been put to\r\nflight, as we shall no more do the honour of considering as enemies\r\ncertain corpses of the Italian political world—(“Bravo!”)—who delude\r\nthemselves that they still exist simply because they abuse our\r\ngenerosity. Tell me, then, Black shirts of Tuscany and of Florence, were\r\nit necessary to begin again, should we begin again? (Deafening applause\r\nand cries of “Yes! Yes!”) This loud cry of yours, more than a promise,\r\nis an oath which seals for ever the Italy of the past, the Italy of the\r\nswindlers, of the deceivers, of the pusillanimous, and opens the way to\r\n“our” Italy, the Italy whom we bear proudly in our hearts, who belongs\r\nto us who represent the new generation who adore strength, who is\r\ninspired by beauty, who is ready for anything when it is necessary to\r\nsacrifice herself to struggle and to die for the ideal.\r\n\r\nI tell you that Italy is going ahead. Two years ago, when the bestiality\r\nof the red demagogy raged, only twenty aeroplanes entered for the\r\nBaracca Cup. Last year they were thirty-five; this year, up to now,\r\nninety. And as we have regained the mastery of the air, so we do not\r\nwant the sea to imprison us. It must be, instead, the way for our\r\nnecessary expansion in the world. (Great applause.)\r\n\r\nThese, O Fascisti, Citizens, are the stupendous tasks which lie before\r\nus. And we shall not fail in our aim if each of you will engrave in his\r\nown heart the words by which is summed up the commandment of this\r\nineffable hour of our history as a people: “Work,” which little by\r\nlittle must redeem us from foreign dependence; “Harmony,” which must\r\nmake of the Italians one family; “Discipline,” by which at a given\r\nmoment all Italians become one and march hand in hand towards the same\r\ngoal.\r\n\r\nBlack shirts! You feel that all the manœuvres of our adversaries tending\r\nto sever me from you are ridiculous and grotesque. And I hope it will\r\nnot seem to you too proud a statement if I say that Fascismo, which I\r\nhave guided on the consular roads of Rome, is solidly in our\r\nhand—(“Bravo!”)—and that if anybody should delude himself in this\r\nrespect I should only need to make a sign, to give an order: “_A noi!_”\r\n(Deafening applause.)\r\n\r\nRaise up your standards! They have been consecrated by the sacred blood\r\nof our dead. When faith has thus been consecrated it cannot fail, cannot\r\ndie, _will not_ die! (Prolonged applause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   “I PROMISE YOU—AND GOD IS MY WITNESS—THAT I SHALL CONTINUE NOW AND\r\n           ALWAYS TO BE A HUMBLE SERVANT OF OUR ADORED ITALY”\r\n\r\n   Speech delivered on 19th June 1923, at Florence, in the historical\r\n      Salone dei Cinquecento, where the Municipal Council solemnly\r\n       bestowed on Mussolini the freedom of the city of Florence.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Mayor, Councillors, People of Florence, the capital for many\r\ncenturies of Italian art,—You will notice that—on account of the honour\r\nwhich you pay me—I feel moved. To be made a citizen of Florence, of this\r\ncity which has left such indelible traces on the history of humanity,\r\nrepresents a memorable and dominating event in my life. I do not know if\r\nI am really worthy of so much honour. (Cries of “Yes.” “May God preserve\r\nyou for the future of our Italy.” Applause.)\r\n\r\nWhat I have done up to now is not much; but oh! Citizens of Florence, my\r\ndetermination is unshakable. (“Bravo!”) Human nature, which is always\r\nweak, may fail, but not my spirit, which is dominated by a moral and\r\nmaterial faith—the faith of the country.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment in which Italian Fascismo raised its standards, lit its\r\ntorches, cauterised the sores which infected the body of our divine\r\ncountry, we Italians, who felt proud to be Italians—(“Bravo! Bravo!”\r\nApplause.)—are in spiritual communion through this new faith.\r\n\r\nCitizens of Florence! I make you a promise, and be sure I shall keep it!\r\nI promise you—and God is my witness in this moment of the purity of my\r\nfaith—I promise you that I shall continue now and always to be a humble\r\nservant of our adored Italy! (Prolonged applause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     “THE VICTORY OF THE PIAVE WAS THE DECIDING FACTOR OF THE WAR”\r\n\r\n  Speech delivered in Rome on 25th June 1923, from Palazzo Venezia, in\r\n      commemoration of the anniversary of the Battle of the Piave.\r\n\r\n\r\nFellow-Soldiers!—After your ranks, so well disciplined and of such fine\r\nbearing, have marched past His Majesty the King, the intangible symbol\r\nof the country, after the austere ceremony in its silent solemnity\r\nbefore the tomb of the Unknown Warrior, after this formidable display of\r\nsacred strength, words from me are absolutely superfluous, and I do not\r\nintend to make a speech. The march of to-day is a manifestation full of\r\nsignificance and warning. A whole people in arms has met to-day in\r\nspirit in the Eternal City. It is a whole people who, above unavoidable\r\nparty differences, finds itself strongly united when the safety of the\r\ncommon Motherland is at stake.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of the Etna eruption, national solidarity was\r\nwonderfully manifested; from every town, every village, one might say\r\nfrom every hamlet, a fraternal heart-throb went out to the land stricken\r\nby calamity.\r\n\r\nTo-day tens of thousands of soldiers, thousands of standards, with men\r\ncoming to Rome from all parts of Italy and from the far-away Colonies,\r\nfrom abroad, bear witness that the unity of the Italian nation is an\r\naccomplished and irrevocable fact.\r\n\r\nAfter seven months of Government, to talk to you, my comrades of the\r\ntrenches, is the highest honour which could fall to my lot. And I do not\r\nsay this in order to flatter you, nor to pay you a tribute which might\r\nseem formal on an occasion like this. I have the right to interpret the\r\nthoughts of this meeting, which gathers to listen to my words as an\r\nexpression of solidarity with the national Government. (Cries of\r\nassent.) Let us not utter useless and fantastical words. Nobody attacks\r\nthe sacred liberty of the Italian people. But I ask you: Should there be\r\nliberty to maim victory? (Cries of “No! no!”) Should there be liberty to\r\nstrike at the nation? Should there be liberty for those who have as\r\ntheir programme the overthrow of our national institutions? (Cries of\r\n“No! no!”) I repeat what I explicitly said before. I do not feel myself\r\ninfallible, I feel myself a man like you.\r\n\r\nI do not repulse, I cannot, I shall not repulse any loyal and sincere\r\ncollaboration.\r\n\r\nFellow-soldiers! The task which weighs on my shoulders, but also on\r\nyours, is simply immense, and to it we shall be pledged for many years.\r\nIt is, therefore, necessary not to waste, but to treasure and utilise\r\nall the energies which could be turned to the good of our country. Five\r\nyears have passed since the battle of the Piave, from that victory on\r\nwhich it is impossible to sophisticate either within or beyond the\r\nfrontier. It is necessary to proclaim, for you who listen to me, and\r\nalso for those who read what I say, that the _victory of the Piave was\r\nthe deciding factor of the war_.... On the Piave the Austro-Hungarian\r\nEmpire went to pieces, from the Piave started its flight on white wings\r\nthe victory of the people in arms. The Government means to exalt the\r\nspiritual strength which rises out of the victory of a people in arms.\r\nIt does not mean to disperse them, because it represents the sacred seed\r\nof the future. The more distant we get from those days, from that\r\nmemorable victory, the more they seem to us wonderful, the more the\r\nvictory appears enveloped in a halo of legend. In such a victory\r\neverybody would wish to have taken part!\r\n\r\n\r\n_We must win the Peace!_ Too late somebody perceived that when the\r\ncountry is in danger the duty of all citizens, from the highest to the\r\nlowest, is only one: to fight, to suffer and, if needs be, to die!\r\n\r\nWe have won the war, we have demolished an Empire which threatened our\r\nfrontiers, stifled us and held us for ever under the extortion of armed\r\nmenace. History has no end. Comrades! The history of peoples is not\r\nmeasured by years, but by tens of years, by centuries. This\r\nmanifestation of yours is an infallible sign of the vitality of the\r\nItalian people.\r\n\r\nThe phrase “we must win the peace” is not an empty one. It contains a\r\nprofound truth. Peace is won by harmony, by work and by discipline. This\r\nis the new gospel which has been opened before the eyes of the new\r\ngenerations who have come out of the trenches; a gospel simple and\r\nstraightforward, which takes into account all the elements, which\r\nutilises all the energies, which does not lend itself to tyrannies of\r\ngrotesque exclusivism, because it has one sole aim, a common aim: the\r\ngreatness and the salvation of the nation!\r\n\r\nFellow-soldiers! You have come to Rome, and it is natural, I dare to\r\nsay, fated! Because Rome is always, as it will be to-morrow and in the\r\ncenturies to come, the living heart of our race! It is the imperishable\r\nsymbol of our vitality as a people. Who holds Rome, holds the nation!\r\n\r\n\r\n_The “Black Shirts” buried the Past._ I assure you, my fellow-soldiers,\r\nthat my Government, in spite of the manifest or hidden difficulties,\r\nwill keep its pledges. It is the Government of Vittorio Veneto. You feel\r\nit and you know it. And if you did not believe it, you would not be here\r\nassembled in this square. Carry back to your towns, to your lands, to\r\nyour houses, distant but near to my heart, the vigorous impression of\r\nthis meeting.\r\n\r\nKeep the flame burning, because that which has not been, may be, because\r\nif victory was maimed once, it does not follow that it can be maimed a\r\nsecond time! (Loud cheers, repeated cries of “We swear it!”)\r\n\r\nI keep in mind your oath. I count upon you as I count upon all good\r\nItalians, but I count, above all, upon you, because you are of my\r\ngeneration, because you have come out from the bloody filth of the\r\ntrenches, because you have lived and struggled and suffered in the face\r\nof death, because you have fulfilled your duty and have the right to\r\nvindicate that to which you are entitled, not only from the material but\r\nfrom the moral point of view. I tell you, I swear to you, that the time\r\nis passed for ever when fighters returning from the trenches had to be\r\nashamed of themselves, the time when, owing to the threatening attitudes\r\nof Communists, the officers received the cowardly advice to dress in\r\nplain clothes. (Applause.) All that is buried. You must not forget, and\r\nnobody forgets, that seven months ago fifty-two thousand armed “black\r\nshirts” came to Rome to bury the past! (Loud cheers.)\r\n\r\nSoldiers! Fellow-Soldiers! Let us raise before our great unknown comrade\r\nthe cry, which sums up our faith: Long live the King! Long live Italy,\r\nvictorious, impregnable, immortal! (Loud cheers, whilst all the flags\r\nare raised and waved amidst the enthusiasm of the immense crowd in the\r\nsquare.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n           THE RELATIONS BETWEEN ITALY AND THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\n               Speech by the American Ambassador to Rome.\r\n\r\n  On the 28th June 1923 the Italo-American Association held in Rome a\r\n  banquet in honour of Mr. Richard Washburn Child, American Ambassador\r\n  to Italy, and of the Hon. Mussolini, President of the Italian\r\n  Council. The two distinguished guests delivered the following\r\n  speeches,[14] which have a special importance, both with regard to\r\n  Fascismo and to Italo-American relations.\r\n\r\nFootnote 14:\r\n\r\n    The two speeches have been courteously given at his request to\r\n    Baron Quaranta di San Severino for publication by the American\r\n    Ambassador, Richard Washburn Child.\r\n\r\n  The object of this meeting was clearly explained by the Hon. Baron\r\n  Sardi, Italian Under-Secretary of State for Public Works, in an\r\n  appropriate address to the illustrious guests (published in full by\r\n  the Bulletin of the Library for American Studies in Italy, No. 5),\r\n  in which, after having thanked them in the name of Senator Ruffini,\r\n  President of the Association, still detained on account of important\r\n  duties in Geneva, and also in the name of the other members, for the\r\n  honour they conferred on the Society by their presence, went on to\r\n  lay stress on the purpose for which the Association exists, namely,\r\n  to promote a better reciprocal understanding between the American\r\n  and Italian peoples through the manifold activities of their\r\n  respective countries.\r\n\r\n  The Hon. Sardi announced that during the summer months of this year\r\n  courses of preparation will be inaugurated again for American\r\n  students who wish to come and visit our country and study our\r\n  language, literature and history, while for next October, under the\r\n  patronage of the American Ambassador and the Italian Premier, with\r\n  the co-operation of American and Italian professors, special\r\n  industrial and commercial courses are in preparation. The American\r\n  students will be able to benefit by the use of the valuable library\r\n  of the Association, which is daily enriched by the competent work of\r\n  Commendatore Harry Nelson Gay and his collaborators.\r\n\r\n  The Hon. Sardi, after referring to the fraternity of arms, which\r\n  during the Great War brought together the soldiers of Italy and\r\n  America, said that, having returned now to the peaceful spheres of\r\n  industry and culture, these forms of effort contribute strongly to\r\n  cement between the two countries that spiritual fraternity which\r\n  arises out of a better mutual acquaintance with the respective\r\n  virtues and qualities and a clearer realisation of our aspirations.\r\n\r\n  The orator concluded by expressing the wish that the Italo-American\r\n  Association, by the indissoluble union of cultured minds, might be\r\n  able to intensify the bonds already uniting the United States of\r\n  America and Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. President and Gentlemen,—It is my privilege to propose a toast to\r\nthe King and to the spirit of an Italy now stronger and more united than\r\never before.\r\n\r\nI wish to express the earnest hope that my country and yours will\r\ncontinue to stand together in upholding ideals which make men strong\r\ninstead of tolerating those which make men weak.\r\n\r\nDuring the last eight months Italy has made an extraordinary\r\ncontribution to the whole world by raising ideals of human courage,\r\ndiscipline, and responsibility. I would be unfaithful to my beliefs and\r\nto those of hosts of Americans if I failed to acknowledge the part\r\nplayed by your President of Council, Mussolini, with the people of\r\nItaly, in giving to all mankind an example of courageous national\r\norganisation founded upon the disciplined responsibility of the\r\nindividual to the State, upon the abandonment of false hopes in feeble\r\ndoctrines, and upon appeal to the full vigorous strength of the human\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nWe have heard a great deal in the last few years about the menace which\r\nwar brings before the face of the world. I am confident that my people\r\nand your people are willing to act together to contribute anything\r\npossible to reduce the dangers of war, but I hold the belief, and I\r\nthink your Premier holds the belief, that worse menaces than war now\r\noppose the progress of mankind. Folly and weakness and decay are worse.\r\n\r\nThese menaces of weakness are often fostered by men of good intentions,\r\nwho talk about the need to rescue mankind and about the necessity to\r\nestablish the rights of mankind.\r\n\r\nI want to see leaders of men who, instead of teaching humanity to look\r\noutside themselves for help, will teach humanity that it has power\r\nwithin itself to relieve its own distress. I want to see leaders who,\r\ninstead of telling men of their rights, will lead them to take a full\r\nshare of their responsibilities.\r\n\r\nI do not doubt that the spirit of benevolence is a precious possession\r\nof mankind, but a more precious possession is the spirit which raises\r\nthe strength of humanity so that benevolence itself becomes less of a\r\nnecessity. He who makes himself strong and calls upon others to be\r\nstrong is even more kind and loving of the world than he who encourages\r\nmen to seek dependence on forces outside themselves or upon\r\nimpracticable plans for new social structures. I do not doubt the good\r\nfaith of many of those who put forth theories of new arrangements of\r\nsocial, economic and international structure, but they may all be sure\r\nthat more important than any of these theories is individual\r\nresponsibility and the growth and spread of self-reliance in the home\r\nand in the nation.\r\n\r\nI do not doubt that we, Italians and Americans, have a full appreciation\r\nof the pity which we ought to confer upon weak or wailing groups or\r\nnations or races which clamour for help or favour; but I trust that,\r\neven in the competition of peace or war, I shall be the last ever to\r\nbelieve that weak groups or nations or races are superior or are more\r\nworthy of my affection than those who mind their own business with\r\nindustry, strength and courage, and stand upon their own strong legs.\r\n\r\nI do not question the motives of many of those who, feeling affectionate\r\nregard for the welfare of their fellow-men, hope for a structure of\r\nsociety in which international bodies shall hand down benefactions to\r\ncommunities, and communities shall hand down benefactions to\r\nindividuals. I merely point out that some nations, such as yours and\r\nmine, are beginning to believe that these ideas come out of thoughts\r\nwhich, though easily adopted, are the offspring of a marriage of\r\nbenevolence with ignorance. In any structure of society which can\r\ncommand our respect and our faith the current of responsibility runs the\r\nother way. The doctrine that the world’s strength arises from the\r\nresponsibility of the individual is a sterner doctrine. The leaders of\r\nmen who insist upon it are those who will be owed an eternal debt by\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nThe strength of society must come from the bottom upward. The world\r\nneeds now more than anything else the doctrine that the first place to\r\ndevelop strength is at home, the first duty is the nearest duty. A\r\nstrong co-operation of nations can only be made of nations which are\r\nstrong nations, a strong nation can only be made of good and strong\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\nWhen one makes the _fasces_, the first requirement is to find the\r\nindividual rods, straight, strong and wiry, such as you have found, Mr.\r\nPresident, and so skilfully bound together in the strength of unity. But\r\nif they had been rotten sticks you could not have made the _fasces_.\r\nUnity in action would have been impossible. The rotten sticks would have\r\nfallen to pieces in your fingers.\r\n\r\nMr. President, what the world needs is not better theories and dreams,\r\nbut better men to carry them out. The world needs a spirit which thinks\r\nfirst of responsibilities before it thinks of rights. It was this spirit\r\nwhich you have done so much to awaken into new life in Italy.\r\n\r\nNot long ago I heard a speech made by a foreigner in Italy who is used\r\nto dealing with economic statistics. He was trying to account for the\r\nnew life in Italy on the basis of comparative statistics. I told him he\r\ncould not do it until he could produce statistics of the human spirit. I\r\ntold him he could not account for everything in Italy until he could\r\nreduce to statistics that wonderful record of the human spirit which in\r\nscarcely more than half a century has created the new Italy. I told him\r\nhe would have to account for the number of Italians who in 1848 and\r\n1859, in the Great War and 1923, had a cause for which they were willing\r\nto die. I told him that I was always a nationalist before I was an\r\ninternationalist, and I would go on being a nationalist, believing in\r\nthe spirit of strong and upright and generous nationalism, and believing\r\nnot in theorising nations or whining peoples, but in nations and peoples\r\nwho develop a national spirit so finely tempered that they offer to the\r\nworld an example of organisation, discipline and fair play, because they\r\nthemselves are upright and strong men and can contribute valuably to\r\ninternational co-operation. I said to him that when he could produce\r\nstatistics on human virtues and human spirit he would be nearer to\r\nunderstanding what made progress in the world. I asked him if he had\r\nfigures to show the difference between nations which breed men who are\r\nready to die for their beliefs and nations which produce no such men. I\r\nasked him to put his figures back in his pocket and go out and talk to\r\nthe youth of Italy.\r\n\r\nMr. President, the youth of Italy, as in any other country, are the\r\ntrustees of the spirit of to-morrow. It is a fact which goes almost\r\nunnoticed, that the training of masses of youth in the spirit of\r\ndiscipline and fair competition and of loyalty to a cause is largely to\r\nbe found in athletic games. It is a fact which almost always is\r\nforgotten, that nations of history or those of to-day which have engaged\r\nin athletic games are the strong nations, and those which have had no\r\nathletics are the weak nations. It is a fact almost neglected that\r\nnations which can express their spirit of competition in athletics are\r\nthe nations which have the least destructive restlessness within and are\r\nthe most fair and, indeed, are the most restrained in their dealings\r\nwith other nations.\r\n\r\nAthletic games teach the lesson that every man who competes must win by\r\nreason of his own virtue. No help can come from without. There is no\r\nspecial privilege for anyone. He who wins does so by merit alone.\r\nAthletic games, whenever they are carried on by teams, teach the lesson\r\nthat the individual must put aside his own interests for the good of his\r\ngroup. There must be a voluntary submission to discipline and absolute\r\nloyalty to a captain in order to avoid the humiliation of\r\ndisorganisation and defeat.\r\n\r\nAthletic games are not for the weak and complaining, but for the strong\r\nand for the lovers of fair play.\r\n\r\nFinally, they furnish oft-repeated lessons of the truth that when flesh\r\nand muscles and material agencies seem about to fail, human will and\r\nhuman spirit can work miracles of victory.\r\n\r\nBecause I believe in these ideals for my own country and for yours, I\r\noffer through you, for the purposes which the Olympic Committee of Italy\r\nwill set forth, a small but friendly token of my deep interest in the\r\nyouth of Italy. (Loud applause.)\r\n\r\nTHE ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER’S REPLY\r\n\r\nMr. Ambassador,—The discourse which your Excellency has pronounced at\r\nthis reunion strengthens the bonds of sympathy and fraternity between\r\nItaly and America, and has profoundly interested me in my capacity as an\r\nItalian and as a Fascista. As an Italian, because you have spoken frank\r\nwords of cordial approval of the Government which I have the honour to\r\ndirect. I have no need to add that this cordiality is reciprocated by me\r\nand by all Italians. There is no doubt that the elements for a practical\r\ncollaboration between the two countries exist. It is only a question of\r\norganising this collaboration. Some things have been done, but more\r\nremain to be done.\r\n\r\nI will not surprise your Excellency if I point out, without going into\r\nparticulars, a problem which concerns us directly. I speak of the\r\nproblem of emigration. I limit myself only to saying that Italy would\r\ngreet with satisfaction an opening in the somewhat rigid meshes of the\r\nImmigration Bill, so that there could be an increase in Italian\r\nemigration to North America, and would greet with similar satisfaction\r\nthe employment of American capital in Italian enterprises. As a\r\nFascista, the words of your Excellency have interested me because they\r\nreveal an exact understanding of the phenomenon and of our movement, and\r\nconstitute a sympathetic and powerful vindication of it. This fact is\r\nthe more remarkable because the Fascismo movement is so complex that the\r\nmind of a stranger is not always the best adapted to understand it. You,\r\nMr. Ambassador, constitute the most brilliant exception to this rule.\r\nYour discourse, I say, contains all the philosophy of Fascismo and of\r\nthe Fascismo endeavour, interwoven with an exaltation of strength, of\r\nbeauty, of discipline, of authority, and of the sense of responsibility.\r\nYou have been able to show, Mr. Ambassador, that in spite of the\r\nnumerous difficulties of the general situation, Fascismo has kept faith\r\nto its promises given before the “March on Rome.” The time intervening\r\nsince those promises were made has been short, so that only a stupid\r\nperson would pretend that the work is already completed. I limit myself\r\nto saying that I find corroboration by your Excellency that it is well\r\nbegun.\r\n\r\nI am certain, Mr. Ambassador, that all Italians will read with emotion\r\nthe words which you have pronounced on this memorable occasion. I ask\r\nyou especially to believe this. I have heard, just now, not a discourse\r\nin the manner and strain of an ordinary conventional speech, but a clear\r\nand inspiring exposition of the conception of life and history which\r\nanimates Italian Fascismo. I do not believe that I exaggerate when I say\r\nthat this conception finds strong and numerous partisans even on the\r\nother side of the ocean, among the citizens of a people who have not the\r\nthousands of years of history behind them which we have, but who march\r\nto-day in the vanguard of human progress. In this affinity of\r\nconceptions I find the solid basis for the fraternal understanding\r\nbetween Italy and America. The announcement that you, Mr. Ambassador,\r\nare giving a wreath of gold to the Italian youth who will be victor in\r\nthe next Olympic competition games will win the hearts of all Italian\r\nathletes, and of these there are, as you know, innumerable legions.\r\n\r\nI thank your Excellency in the name of Italian youth, almost all of whom\r\nhave put on the “black shirt,” especially the young athletes, and, at\r\nthe same time that I encourage the Italo-American Society to persevere\r\nin the execution of its splendid programme, I declare that my Government\r\nwill do whatever is necessary to develop and strengthen the economic and\r\npolitical relations between the United States and Italy.\r\n\r\nI raise my glass to the health of President Harding and the fortunes of\r\nthe great American people. (Loud applause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n “THE GREATNESS OF THE COUNTRY WILL BE ACHIEVED BY THE NEW GENERATIONS”\r\n\r\n  Speech delivered 2nd July 1923 in Rome, at the Palazzo Venezia,\r\n  before the schoolboys of Trieste, Nicastro, Castelgandolfo, Vetralla\r\n  and Perugia and their masters, who were accompanied by\r\n  representatives of the Roman “balillas,” and had come to Rome to pay\r\n  homage at the tomb of the “Unknown Warrior,” before which they laid\r\n  a wreath of beaten iron and kneeling repeated the oath of love and\r\n  loyalty to the King and the Country. The Hon. Mussolini with the\r\n  Minister of War, General Diaz; the Under-Secretary of State for the\r\n  Presidency, Hon. Acerbo; General De Bono, the Director General of\r\n  Police; Signor Lombardo Radice, the Director General of Primary\r\n  Schools, and other officials, greeted them. The Hon. Mussolini thus\r\n  addressed the meeting:\r\n\r\n\r\nOn this radiant morning you have offered the capital a magnificent\r\nspectacle. Romans, having lived through many millenniums of history, are\r\nrather slow in being impressed by events and are not easily to be\r\ncarried away by excessive enthusiasm. They have certainly however been\r\nfilled to-day with admiration at this scene of promising youth which has\r\nbeen offered them by the schoolboys here gathered from all parts of\r\nItaly and especially from the “Venezia Giulia,” particularly dear to the\r\nheart of all Italians. It was well said that in the dark pre-war days\r\nthe schools of the National League and in general the schools entrusted\r\nto Italian masters represented the centre around which were nursed the\r\nhopes and the faith of the Italian race. I am glad to express to you the\r\nfeelings of my brotherly sympathy. I am pleased to add that the National\r\nGovernment, the Fascista Government, holds in high esteem the scholarly\r\ncharacteristics and has deep respect for the teachers of all grades, of\r\nall schools.\r\n\r\nThe Fascista Government feels and knows that the _greatness of the\r\ncountry, to which all of us must consecrate the best of our energies,\r\nwill be achieved by the new generations_.\r\n\r\nYou (continued the Hon. Mussolini, turning especially to the masters),\r\nyou must be the artificers—as you show you are—of this great Italian\r\nrestoration.\r\n\r\nThe task falls on you of blending together in increasing intimacy the\r\nintellectual life of the Italians who were slaves to Austria with that\r\nof the Italians who rose and sacrificed themselves by hundreds of\r\nthousands to break their fetters.\r\n\r\nYou passed before the Unknown Warrior, and you certainly gathered his\r\nspirit; take it to Trieste near the other great spirit of him who was\r\nthe forerunner of your liberation and of ours: Guglielmo Oberdan! (Loud\r\napplause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE SITUATION ON THE RUHR AND OTHER QUESTIONS OF FOREIGN POLICY\r\n\r\n      Speech delivered 3rd July 1923, at the Council of Ministers.\r\n\r\n\r\nHonourable Ministers and Colleagues,—From my last detailed declarations\r\nof Foreign Policy made at the Senate up to to-day the salient events of\r\ninternational politics are the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Bulgarian Coup d’état._ The first is the Bulgarian _coup d’état_,\r\nfollowing which the opponents of the Fascista Government fell into\r\ncertain paradoxical misunderstandings. The end of Stambuliski and the\r\nadvent of Zankoff aroused a certain ferment in some of the countries of\r\nthe Little Entente. Italy at once took a moderating action in the right\r\nquarters and the complications feared were averted.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Treaty of Lausanne._ The signing of the Peace Treaty of Lausanne\r\nseems imminent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Situation in the Ruhr._ In the last few days the situation in the\r\nRuhr has become aggravated. On one side the passive resistance\r\ncontinues; on the other, the occupation is extended and intensified by\r\nmeasures of a nature increasingly political and military. A general\r\nrepercussion of this crisis, which seems to have reached its acute\r\nstage, is felt by the European exchanges, which are all falling, not\r\nexcluding the English sovereign, as compared with the dollar.\r\n\r\nThe attempt made by the Pope, so noble in its humanitarian and European\r\naims, has not modified the situation. On the day after the letter to\r\nCardinal Gasparri there was, on the part of the French, Poincaré’s\r\nspeech, which had the unanimous approval of the Senate, and, on the same\r\nday, the fearful act of “sabotage” which cost the lives of many Belgian\r\nsoldiers. All this does not represent a _détente_ but an aggravation of\r\nthe situation.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, following the solution of the Belgian crisis, it has\r\nbeen possible to resume diplomatic action. Italy participates directly\r\nin it, and as soon as she sees the problem on its way to complete\r\nsolution, will signify her consent to those propositions of the\r\nMemorandum of London, from which none of the projects presented\r\nafterwards has departed, that is to say: connection of the problem of\r\nReparations with that of Inter-Allied debts; sufficient moratorium to\r\nGermany; the fixing of a definite amount; rational scheme for payment;\r\nsolid guarantees of an economic nature and, hence, renunciation on the\r\npart of France of the territorial occupation of the Ruhr.\r\n\r\nAs for passive resistance, the Italian Government thinks that it is not\r\nin Germany’s interest to prolong it, because she cannot hope to weaken\r\nFrance nor can she delude herself that she may obtain outside help.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly necessary urgently to hasten the possibility of an\r\nagreement, as the occupation of the Ruhr has weighed heavily on the\r\neconomic life of Europe, delaying its recovery.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fiume._ As to the question of Fiume, representations have been made to\r\nBelgrade so that negotiations might be conducted more equably, in view\r\nof the situation of the town and of the necessity of putting on a normal\r\nfooting the relations between the two countries. (The Council approves\r\nthe declarations of the Hon. Mussolini.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE ELECTORAL REFORM BILL\r\n\r\n     Speech delivered at the Chamber of Deputies on 16th July 1923.\r\n\r\n\r\nHonourable Gentlemen,—I should have preferred to speak to this Assembly\r\non that question of Foreign Policy which at this moment interests Italy\r\nand fills the world with excitement: I mean the Ruhr. I should have\r\nproved that the action of Italy is autonomous, and is inspired by the\r\nprotection of our interests and also by the need generally felt to get\r\nout of a crisis which impoverishes and humiliates our continent.\r\n(Assent.) I promise myself to do so shortly, if the Chamber does not\r\nhave the whim to-day of dying before its time. (Laughter and prolonged\r\ncomments.) My speech will be calm and measured, although fundamentally\r\nforceful. It will be composed of two parts: one that I should like to\r\ncall “negative,” and another which I shall call “positive.”\r\n\r\nAfter all, I am not sorry that the discussion has gone, little or far,\r\nbeyond the limits in which it could have been confined. The discussion\r\non the Electoral Bill has offered opportunity to the Opposition to\r\nreveal itself, to move, from all its sections, from all its benches, to\r\nan attack against the policy and the political system of my Government.\r\nIt will not surprise you, therefore, if, although not entering into\r\ndetails of all the speeches, I pick out from what has been said by the\r\nprincipal speakers those arguments and those propositions which I must\r\ndefinitely refute.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Warning to the Popular Party._ As the speech by the Hon. Petrillo was\r\nfavourable to the Government, it is not worth while to busy ourselves\r\nwith it. (Laughter.)\r\n\r\nI shall give my attention to the speech delivered by the Hon. Gronchi,—a\r\nspeech fine as regards its form, and perhaps still finer as regards its\r\ncontents. The Hon. Gronchi has once again offered the Government a\r\ncollaboration of convenience, as in those _mariages de convenance_ which\r\ndo not last or which end in ceaseless yawns. (Comment.)\r\n\r\nYour collaboration, Gentlemen of the Popular Party, largely consists of\r\ndetails omitted. Your party, too, shows the same weakness. You should\r\nset to work and clear them up.\r\n\r\nI do not know for how long these elements who wish to collaborate\r\nlegally with the National Government can still remain united with your\r\nparty, together with those who would wish to do so but cannot, because\r\ntheir inmost feelings do not allow them this step and this\r\ncollaboration. You certainly know me well enough to understand that, as\r\nfar as political discussion goes, I am intransigent. The small fry of\r\nthe two-fifths and of the three-quarters or some other fraction of this\r\nelectoral arithmetic does not interest nor concern me. Politics cannot\r\nbe compared to a retail business. (Assent and comment.) To be or not to\r\nbe! I am such a poor electoralist that I could even let you have the\r\nthirty or forty deputies who satisfy you; but I do not give them to you,\r\nas this would be immoral, because it would represent a transaction which\r\nmust be repugnant to your conscience, as it is to mine. (Assent and\r\ncomment.) In fact, I cannot accept a kind of Malthusian collaboration!\r\n(Laughter and approval.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Russian and the Italian Revolutions both tend to overcome all\r\nIdeologies._ The speech delivered by the Hon. Labriola was certainly\r\npowerful. He said that Ministerial crises are a substitute for\r\nrevolution. He should have said “Ersatz,” because substitutes, since\r\nthe war, are of German origin. That is too like the opinion of a\r\nherbalist to be accepted. It may be that the want of Ministerial\r\ncrises leads to revolution, but here you have an example that shows\r\nhow excessive Ministerial crises lead also to revolution. But, above\r\nall, it astounded me to hear the Hon. Labriola still employ the old\r\nvocabulary of second-class Socialist literature, speaking of\r\nbourgeoisie and proletariat—two entities clearly defined and\r\nperpetually in a state of antagonism. It is certainly true that there\r\nis not one bourgeoisie, but there are, perhaps, twenty-four or\r\nforty-eight bourgeoisies and under-bourgeoisies. The same can be said\r\nof the proletariat. What relation can there be between a workman of\r\nthe “Fiat” factory—specialised, refined, with tendencies and tastes\r\nalready bourgeois, who earns thirty to fifty lire a day—what relation\r\ncan there be between this so-called proletarian and the poor peasant\r\nof Southern Italy, who despairingly scrapes his land burnt by the sun?\r\n(Assent and comments.)\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Labriola has said that only the proletariat can give itself the\r\nluxury of a dictatorship. This is a mistake which is proved and can be\r\nproved. The only example of dictatorship is offered us by Russia. But\r\nthe Hon. Labriola has written dozens of articles to prove that\r\ndictatorship does not exist in Russia and that dictatorship is not “of”\r\nbut “upon” the proletariat. All those who govern the Russian States are\r\nprofessors, lawyers, economists, literary men, men of talent; that is to\r\nsay, men coming from the professional classes, from the bourgeoisie.\r\n\r\nThe fault which the Hon. Labriola lays on us, finding an analogy between\r\nthe methods and the evolution of the Russian and of the Italian\r\nrevolution, does not exist. And here I make a simple statement of\r\nhistorical order. It is a fact that both revolutions tend to destroy all\r\nthe ideologies and in a certain sense the Liberal and Democratic\r\ninstitutions which were the outcome of the French Revolution.\r\n\r\n_Italy pulled herself together after Caporetto, because the necessary\r\nDiscipline of War was imposed on her._ During the last few days use and\r\nabuse of a polemic method have been made, that of unearthing the\r\nwritings and opinions of the past to employ them as a weapon in the\r\npresent dispute. This is a very wretched system which I am going to use\r\nagainst those who have adopted it.\r\n\r\nIn his speech the Hon. Alessio has stated that the defeat of the Central\r\nEmpires was due to the deficiency of their representative organs. This\r\nis a totally one-sided explanation. There has been a war; millions of\r\nmen have fought against the Central Empires and defeated them. Another\r\nmistake is to say that after Caporetto Italy pulled herself together\r\nbecause she had regained her liberty. Nothing of the kind! The reason is\r\nthat the necessary war discipline was imposed upon her. (Loud applause\r\non the Right.) I am not one of those who think that Caporetto was due\r\nentirely to the disintegration of the country in rear of the fighting\r\nfront. It was a military reverse in its causes and development; but\r\nthere is no doubt that the atmosphere of the country, an atmosphere of\r\nleniency and of excessive tolerance, has produced disturbing moral\r\nphenomena which must have contributed to our reverse.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Dawn of Italian Risorgimento came from the Bourgeoisie of Naples._\r\nThe other statement made by the Hon. Alessio, that the Italian\r\nRisorgimento represented the efforts of the Italian lower classes, is\r\nsuperficial. Alas! it is not so. The Italian lower classes were absent\r\nand often hostile to it. The first dawn of the Italian Risorgimento came\r\nfrom Naples, from that bourgeoisie of intelligent and gallant\r\nprofessional men which in Southern Italy represents a class\r\nhistorically, politically and morally well-defined. (Applause and\r\nassent.) Those who at Nola in 1821 hoisted the standard of revolution\r\nagainst the Bourbons were two cavalry officers. All the noble\r\nmartyrology of the Italian Risorgimento is formed out of elements of the\r\nbourgeoisie. Nothing is sadder than the useless sacrifice of the\r\nBandiera brothers. And when you think of the tragedy of Carlo Pisacane\r\nyou are thrilled! (Applause.) I should like to deny that Giuseppe\r\nMazzini himself can be included in Democracy. His methods were certainly\r\nnot democratic. He was very consistent in his aims, but how many times\r\nwas he not incoherent and changeable in his means?\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Expedition to the Crimea really prepared the way for the Unity of\r\nItaly._ And what about Cavour? I think that the event which really\r\nprepared the way for the unity of the country was the expedition to the\r\nCrimea,—(Comment.)—which represents one of the most noteworthy in\r\nhistory. I recall it because it shows how in solemn hours the decision\r\nis left to one man, who must consult only his own conscience. (Applause\r\nand comment.) When General Dabormida refused to sign the Treaty of\r\nAlliance with France and with England, Cavour, on the same evening of\r\nthe 1st of January 1855, signed it without consulting Parliament or the\r\nCouncil of Ministers, and signed it above all at his discretion without\r\nimposing any condition whatsoever. It was a stroke of rashness that you\r\nmight call sublime. Cavour himself recognised it, and when writing to\r\nCount Oldofredi, he said: “I have taken a tremendous responsibility on\r\nmy shoulders. It does not matter. Let happen what may. My conscience\r\ntells me that I have fulfilled a sacred duty!”\r\n\r\nWhen the soldiers of the small and valiant Piedmont were on the point of\r\nleaving, the discussion in the Subalpine Parliament took place, and\r\nAngelo Brofferio, a kind of Cavallotti of the time,—(Comment.)—accused\r\nCavour of not having a definite political line of conduct. It is really\r\nworth while to read part of this speech, because it closely recalls the\r\nspeeches which during the present week have been made in this hall.\r\n\r\n“Our Ministers,” said Angelo Brofferio, “represent all ideas and all\r\nconvictions. At one time they become Conservatives and withhold the Jury\r\nfrom the Press; another time they ape the Democrats and raise cries\r\nagainst usurpations of Rome; still another time they throw off the mask\r\nand become retrogrades in order to unite with Austria!”\r\n\r\nAngelo Brofferio ends with these really singular words: “Where is in\r\nthis system respect for convention and for constitutional morality?”\r\nand, referring to the Treaty, he added: “May God preserve us from that\r\nsinister eventuality! But if you agree to this Treaty, the prostitution\r\nof Piedmont and the ruin of Italy will be accomplished facts!”\r\n\r\nIt is curious, also, that another powerful ideologist, certainly sacred\r\nto the memory of all Italians, Giuseppe Mazzini, was very much against\r\nthis Treaty, even to the extent of calling “deported” the Piedmontese\r\nsoldiers who were leaving for the Crimea and of inciting them to desert!\r\nBut Garibaldi, a far more practical leader, had an intuition of the\r\nfundamental importance of the Treaty of Alliance between Piedmont and\r\nWestern Powers. “Italy,” said Garibaldi, “should lose no opportunity of\r\nunfurling her flag on the battlefield which might recall to European\r\nnations her political existence.”\r\n\r\nTo-day you certainly all agree in recognising that history has shown\r\nthat Angelo Brofferio was in the wrong and Camillo Benso, Count of\r\nCavour, was entirely in the right. (Assent.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Moral Unity of the Italian People._ The speech delivered by the\r\nHon. Amendola is, after that of the Hon. Labriola, more worthy of being\r\nanalysed. He said: “The Italian people are affected by a moral and\r\nspiritual crisis, which is certainly connected with our intervention,\r\nwith the war, and with the after-war period,” and he concluded by\r\nsuggesting that it is necessary to give to this Italian people its moral\r\nunity. Well, we must be clear. What means “moral unity of the Italian\r\npeople”? A minimum common denominator, a common field for action, in\r\nwhich all the National Parties meet and understand each other, a general\r\nlevelling of all opinions, of all convictions, of all parties? For me it\r\nis sufficient that moral unity should exist in certain decisive hours of\r\nthe life of the people. We cannot expect to have it on all days and on\r\nall questions. On the other hand I firmly believe that this moral,\r\nfundamental unity of the Italian people is already at work. We ourselves\r\nsee it realised, perhaps not so much by our political work as by the\r\nwar, which has made Italians know one another, and has thrown them\r\ntogether, making of this small peninsula of ours a kind of family.\r\n\r\nMany local boundaries which separated provinces and regions have\r\ndisappeared. Now we must complete the work. The Hon. Bentini, speaking\r\nof the freedom of the Press, to which subject we will return later,\r\nquoted the episode of Garibaldi and Dumas. I fully approve the answer\r\ngiven by Garibaldi. But I ask you—if the newspaper _Indipendente_ had,\r\nby chance, published news concerning the movements of the Garibaldian\r\ntroops or discrediting the military action, do you think that Garibaldi\r\nwould not have suppressed that paper? (Assent and comment.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_We have the Power—we shall hold it and defend it against all!_ But in\r\nthe speech by the Hon. Bentini, what is particularly singular is the\r\nconfusion between tactics and political strategy. To-day it is possible\r\nto win many battles and the war can be lost or won. What happened? You\r\nhad brilliant tactical results, but afterwards you had not the courage\r\nof undertaking what was necessary to reach the final goal. You conquered\r\na great many outlying communes, provinces and institutions, and you did\r\nnot understand that all this was perfectly useless if, at a given\r\nmoment, you had not become masters of the brains, of the heart of the\r\nnation,—(Interruptions on the Extreme Left.)—if, that is to say, you had\r\nnot the courage of making use of a political strategy. To-day your\r\nchance is over, and do not delude yourselves!\r\n\r\nHistory offers certain chances only once. (Assent on the Extreme Right.)\r\nBut to understand this law it is necessary, Honourable Gentlemen, to\r\nkeep before you two very simple considerations, and they are these:\r\nthere has been a war which has shifted interests, which has modified\r\nideas, which has exasperated feelings, and there has also been a\r\nrevolution. To make a revolution it is not necessary to play the great\r\ndrama of the arena. We have left many dead on the roads to Rome and\r\nnaturally anybody who deludes himself is a fool. _We have the power and\r\nwe shall hold it. We shall defend it against anybody!_\r\n\r\nThe revolution lies in this firm determination to hold power! (Assent\r\nand comment.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Italian People under the Domination of a Liberticidal Government,\r\ngroaning under the Fetters of Slavery?_ And now I come to the practical\r\nside of the discussion.\r\n\r\nThey speak of liberty. But what is this liberty? Does liberty exist?\r\nAfter all, it represents a philosophical and moral concept. There are\r\nvarious manifestations of liberty. Liberty never existed. The Socialists\r\nhave always denied it. The liberty of work has never been admitted by\r\nyou. You have beaten the blackleg when he presented himself at the\r\nfactories when the other workmen were on strike. (Applause:\r\ninterruptions by the Extreme Left.)\r\n\r\nBut then is it really true and proved that the Italian people are under\r\nthe domination of a liberticidal Government, and groans in the fetters\r\nof slavery? Is mine a liberticidal Government?\r\n\r\nIn the social field, No! I had the courage to transform the eight hours\r\nday into a law of the State. (Comments on the Extreme Left.) Do not\r\ndespise this victory; do not undervalue it. (Assent.) I have approved\r\nall the social and pacifist Conventions of Washington. What has this\r\nGovernment done in the political field? It is said that Democracy lies\r\nwhere suffrage is widened. Well, this Government has maintained\r\nuniversal suffrage. And, although Italian women, who are intelligent\r\nenough to exact it, had not done so, I have given it, be it only as\r\nregards the municipal elections to from six to eight millions of women!\r\nNo exceptional laws were passed,—(Comments on the Extreme Left.)—and the\r\nregulation of the Press is not an exceptional law.\r\n\r\nYou forget a very simple thing, that the revolution has the right of\r\ndefending itself. (Approval from the Right: comments.) Is there in\r\nRussia liberty of association for those who are not Bolshevists? No! Is\r\nthere liberty of Press for them? No! Is there liberty of meeting, of\r\nvote? No! (Applause: comments on the Extreme Left.) You who are the\r\ndefenders of the Russian régime have not the right to protest against a\r\nrégime like mine, which cannot, even distantly, be compared with that of\r\nthe Bolshevists. (Approval on the Right: comments on the Left.)\r\n\r\nI am not, Gentlemen, a despot who remains locked up in a castle\r\nprotected by strong walls. I circulate freely amongst the people without\r\nany concern whatsoever, and I listen to them. (Loud assent.) Well, the\r\nItalian people, up to now, have not asked for liberty. (Assent on the\r\nRight: comments on the Extreme Left.) At Messina the population which\r\nsurrounded my carriage said: “Take us out of these wooden huts.”\r\n(Assent.) In Sardinia—(you will notice that I am speaking of a region\r\nwhere Fascismo has not tens of thousands of followers as in Lombardy)—in\r\nSardinia, at Arbatax, men came to me with drawn faces; they surrounded\r\nme and, pointing out to me a track with a putrid river among the marshy\r\nreeds, said to me: “Malaria is killing us!” They did not speak to me of\r\nliberty, of the Statute, of the Constitution. It is the emigrants of the\r\nFascista revolution who create this idol which the Italian people, and\r\nnow, too, foreign public opinion, has largely dismantled. (Loud applause\r\non the Right.)\r\n\r\nEvery day I receive dozens of Committees, and hundreds of applications\r\nare flung on my desk, in which one might say that the urgent needs of\r\neach of the eight thousand communes of Italy are represented.\r\n\r\nWell, why should all those not come to me and say: “We suffer because\r\nyou oppress us”? But there is a reason, a fact to which I wish to draw\r\nyour attention. You say that the ex-soldiers fought for liberty. How\r\ndoes it happen, then, that these ex-soldiers are in favour of a\r\nliberticidal Government? (Applause.)\r\n\r\nAre force and consent antagonistic elements? Not at all! In force there\r\nis already consent, and consent is force in itself and for itself.\r\n\r\nBut tell me, have you found on the face of the earth a Government, of\r\nwhatsoever kind, which claimed to make happy all the people it governed?\r\nBut this would mean the squaring of the circle! Whatever Government, be\r\nit even directed by men participating in the Divine wisdom, whatever\r\nmeasure it takes, will make some people discontented. And how can you\r\ncheck this discontent? By force! What is the State? It is the police.\r\nAll your codes of law, the laws themselves, all your doctrines are\r\nnothing if, at a given moment, the police by their physical strength do\r\nnot make felt the indestructible weight of the law. (Comments and\r\nassent.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_We do not want to abolish Parliament._ They say that we want to abolish\r\nParliament. No! It is not true. First of all, we do not know what we\r\ncould substitute for it. (Comment.) Parliaments, the so-called Technical\r\nCouncils, are still in the embryonic stage.\r\n\r\nMaybe they represent some principles of life. With such subjects one can\r\nnever be dogmatic or explicit; but, in the face of to-day’s state of\r\naffairs, they represent only attempts. Maybe that in a second stage it\r\nmay be possible to allot to these Technical Councils a portion of the\r\nlegislative work.\r\n\r\nBut, Gentlemen, I beg you to consider that Fascismo is in favour of\r\nelections. That is to say, it calls for the elections, in order to\r\nconquer the communes and the provinces. It has called for them in order\r\nto send Deputies to Parliament; it does not, therefore, seek to abolish\r\nParliament. On the contrary, as I said before and I repeat it, the\r\nGovernment wants to make of Parliament a more serious, if not more\r\nsolemn institution: it wants, if possible, to bridge over that hiatus\r\nwhich undeniably exists between Fascismo and the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fascismo is not a transitory Phenomenon. Do not hope that its Life will\r\nbe short!_ Gentlemen, we must follow Fascismo, I will not say with love,\r\nbut with intelligence. There must be no illusions. How many times from\r\nthose benches it was said that Fascismo was a transitory phenomenon! You\r\nsaw it. It is an imposing phenomenon which gathers in its followers, one\r\nmight say, by millions. It is the largest mass party which has ever\r\nexisted in Italy. It has in itself some vital, powerful force, and since\r\nit is different from all others, as regards its extent, its\r\norganisation, its discipline, do not hope that its life be short!\r\n\r\nTo-day Fascismo is going through the travail of a profound\r\ntransformation. You will ask: “When will Fascismo grow up?” Oh! I do not\r\nwish it to grow up too soon! (Laughter.) I prefer that it should\r\ncontinue still for some time as it is to-day till all are resigned to\r\nthe _fait accompli_, and have its fine armour and its virile warlike\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\nThere is a fact which is rapidly transforming the essence of Fascismo.\r\nThe Fascista Party, on one side, becomes a Militia, and, on the other,\r\nbecomes an administration and a Government. It is incredible what a\r\nchange the head of a “squadra” undergoes when he becomes an alderman or\r\na mayor. He understands that it is not possible to attack abruptly the\r\nCommunal Budgets without preparation, but that it is necessary to study\r\nthem and devote himself to the administrative part, which is a hard,\r\ndry, and difficult task. (Applause.) And as the communes conquered by\r\nFascisti number now several thousands, you will conclude that the\r\ntransformation of Fascismo into an organ of administration is taking\r\nplace and will be soon an accomplished fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Liberty must not be converted into Licence, and Licence I shall never\r\ngrant!_ You ask: “When will this moral pressure of Fascismo end?” I\r\nunderstand that you are anxious about it. It is natural, but it depends\r\non you. You know that I should be happy to-morrow to have in my\r\nGovernment the direct representatives of the organised working classes.\r\nI would like to have them with me; I would like also to entrust them\r\nwith a Ministry which requires delicate handling, so as to convince them\r\nthat the administration of the State is a thing of the utmost complexity\r\nand difficulty, that there is little to improvise, that _tabula rasa_\r\nmust not be made, as in some revolutions, because afterwards it is\r\nnecessary to rebuild. You cannot take a corporal of the division of\r\nPetrograd and make of him a general, because afterwards you have to call\r\nin a Brusiloff! (Comment.) To sum up, so long as opponents exist who,\r\ninstead of resigning themselves to the _fait accompli_, contemplate a\r\nreactionary movement, we cannot disarm. But I say further that the last\r\nexperience after your attempt at the strike of last year must also have\r\nconvinced you by now that that road will lead you to ruin; whilst, on\r\nthe other hand, you ought to take into account, once and for all, if you\r\nhave in your veins a little Marxist doctrine, that there is a new\r\nsituation, to which (if you are intelligent and watch over the interests\r\nof the classes you say you represent) you should conform. And, moreover,\r\nColombino, who is a friend of Ludovico d’Aragona, can say if I am an\r\nenemy of the working classes. I dare him to deny my statement that six\r\nthousand workmen belonging to the Italian Metallurgic Consortium work\r\nto-day because I helped them and because I did my duty as citizen and\r\nhead of the Italian Government. (Comment and assent.)\r\n\r\nBut liberty, Gentlemen, must not be converted into licence. What they\r\nask for is licence, and this I shall never grant! (Loud applause and\r\ncomment.) You can, if you wish, organise and march along in processions\r\nand I shall have you escorted. But if you intend to throw stones at the\r\ncarabineers or to pass through a street where it is forbidden to do so,\r\nyou will find the State which opposes you, if necessary by force. (Loud\r\napplause on the Right: comment on the Left.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Close Analysis of the Electoral Reform Bill._ But this Electoral Law\r\nwhich harasses us so much: is it really a monster? I declare it to you\r\nthat, were it a monster, I should like to hand it over at once to a\r\nmuseum of monstrosities. (Laughter.) This law, of which I have traced\r\nthe fundamental lines, but which afterwards has been successively\r\nelaborated by my friend the Hon. Acerbo, and re-elaborated by the\r\nCommission, I do not know whether for better or for worse,—(Much\r\nlaughter.)—is a creation, and, like all creations of this world, has its\r\nqualities and defects. One must not condemn it as a whole; it would be a\r\ngreat mistake.\r\n\r\nYou must consider—I say this to you with absolute frankness—that it is a\r\nlaw for us;—(Comments.)—but it involves principles which are\r\nultra-democratic—that of the State election schedule; that of the\r\nnational constituency, which was the vindication of Socialism, as just\r\nnow Constantino Lazzari recalled. You say that the struggle is\r\nimpersonal, that the elections will cause unrest. But who tells you that\r\nthe elections are near? (Laughter: prolonged comments.) The working of\r\nthis law is such that a fourth part of the seats is guaranteed to the\r\nminorities, while I think that, calling the elections by the present\r\nlaw, the minorities would, perhaps, be further sacrificed. (Assent and\r\ncomment.) At any rate the impersonality of the struggle withholds from\r\nthe same struggle that character of harshness which might preoccupy from\r\nthe point of view of public order. As things stand to-day, elections\r\nheld on the uninominal constituency or even on the proportional basis\r\nwould certainly lead to excesses. (Assent.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Government cannot accept Conditions. Either you give it your\r\nConfidence or deny it._ I declare that I shall not call elections until\r\nI am sure that they will be held in independence and order. (Comment and\r\napplause.) I add that while on principle I am, and I must be,\r\nintransigent, I entrust myself, in a certain sense, as regards technical\r\ndiscussion, to the competent elements. In this hall there are very many\r\ncompetent elements. They will say how this law can be even more abused\r\nor improved. (Comment.) But this is the business of the Chamber, and the\r\nGovernment declares to you that it does not refuse to accept those\r\nimprovements which would render easier the exercise of the right to\r\nvote.\r\n\r\nThis concerns in a certain sense the Popular Party, which must decide\r\nfor itself. I have spoken plainly, but I must say not as plainly as has\r\nbeen spoken from those benches. The Government cannot accept conditions.\r\nEither you give it your confidence or you deny it. (Assent and comment.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_On your Vote will depend in a certain sense your Fate!_ I agree with\r\nall the speakers who have declared that the country wishes only to be\r\nleft alone; to work in peace with discipline. And my Government makes\r\nenormous efforts to achieve this result and will go on, even if it has\r\nto strike its own followers, because, having wished for a strong State,\r\nit is only just that we should be the first to experience the\r\nconsequences of strength. (Loud applause.) I have also the duty of\r\ntelling you—and I tell you from a debt of loyalty—that on your vote\r\ndepends in a certain sense your fate! Do not delude yourselves, even in\r\nthis field, because nobody gets out of the Constitution—neither I nor\r\nthe others—as nobody can suppose that he is not amply guaranteed\r\naccording to the spirit and the letter of the Constitution. (Comment.)\r\nAnd then, if things are thus, I tell you, take into account this\r\nnecessity. Do not let the country have once again the impression that\r\nParliament is far from the soul of the nation and that this Parliament,\r\nafter having manœuvred for an entire week in a campaign of opposition,\r\nhas achieved sterile results at the end. Because this is the moment in\r\nwhich Parliament and country can be reconciled. But if this chance is\r\nlost, to-morrow will be too late, and you feel it in the air, you feel\r\nit in yourselves. And then, Gentlemen, do not hang on political labels,\r\ndo not stiffen yourselves in the formal coherence of the parties, do not\r\nclutch at bits of straw, as do the shipwrecked in the ocean, hoping\r\nvainly to save themselves. But listen to the secret and solemn warning\r\nof your conscience; listen also to the incoercible voice of the nation!\r\n\r\n\r\n(The last words of the speech of the Hon. Mussolini, which had been\r\nlistened to all through with the greatest attention by the Assembly and\r\nthe Tribunes, are greeted by frantic, repeated applause by the benches\r\nof the Right, by the Centre and by many Deputies of the Democratic Left.\r\nThe ovation lasts for a long time and is intensified by that paid by all\r\nthe Tribunes.\r\n\r\nWhen the applause is over, all the members of the Government shake hands\r\nwith the President of the Council, while from the benches of the Right\r\nall the Deputies come down to congratulate the Hon. Mussolini, amongst\r\nthem the Hon. Fera, ex-Minister of Justice, and the ex-Prime Ministers,\r\nthe Hon. Giolitti, the Hon. Salandra, the Hon. Orlando, and the\r\nPresident of the Chamber, the Hon. De Nicola, who exclaims: “It is the\r\nfinest speech in the annals of Parliamentary history.”)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sitting is suspended for half an hour. When it is resumed at 8.10\r\nthe Hon. Mussolini agrees to accept the order of the day proposed by\r\nLarussa, viz.:\r\n\r\n“_The Chamber, reaffirming its confidence in the Government, approves\r\nthe principles contained in the Electoral Reform Bill, and passes to the\r\ndiscussion of the Articles of the project._”\r\n\r\nAt 11.10, the operation of voting having been completed, the result is\r\nproclaimed, viz.: “_The Chamber of Deputies votes in favour of the\r\nGovernment by a large majority._”\r\n\r\n(The sitting is adjourned.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   THE MASSACRE OF THE ITALIAN DELEGATION FOR THE DELIMITATION OF THE\r\n                        GRECO-ALBANIAN FRONTIER\r\n\r\n  On the 27th of August, General Enrico Tellini, President of the\r\n  International Commission for the Delimitation of the Greco-Albanian\r\n  Frontier, the medical officer, Major Luigi Corti, and Lieutenant\r\n  Mario Bonacini, members of the Mission, were atrociously murdered in\r\n  Greece, while motoring from Janina to Santi Quaranta.\r\n\r\n  In consideration of preceding assassinations, of all the concordant\r\n  information from different sources gathered on the scene of the\r\n  massacre, and of the persistent campaign of libel and instigation on\r\n  the part of the Greek Press against Italy and the Italian Military\r\n  Mission, the Royal Government (the Stefani Agency informs us) has\r\n  come to the conclusion that the moral as well as implicitly the\r\n  material responsibility of the massacre falls on the Greek\r\n  Government. On these grounds the head of the Government, certain of\r\n  interpreting the sense of indignation of the whole Italian nation,\r\n  has instructed Commendatore Montagna, Minister at Athens, to present\r\n  to Greece the following Note containing Italy’s demands.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hon. Mussolini’s Note_ to Greece demands on behalf of Italy:\r\n\r\n1. Apologies in the most ample and official form, to be presented to the\r\nItalian Government at the Royal Italian Legation at Athens through the\r\nhighest Greek authority;\r\n\r\n2. Solemn funeral ceremony for the victims of the massacre, to be\r\ncelebrated in the Catholic Cathedral at Athens, with the presence of all\r\nthe members of the Greek Government;\r\n\r\n3. Honours to the Italian flag to be paid by the Hellenic Fleet in the\r\nbay of the Piraeus to one of our naval divisions, which will proceed\r\nthere purposely, and this by means of a salute of twenty-one shots fired\r\nby the Hellenic ships, whilst the Greek Fleet flies the Italian flag\r\nfrom the masthead;\r\n\r\n4. A strict inquiry will be held by the Greek authorities on the scene\r\nof the massacre, with the assistance of the Royal Military Italian\r\nAttaché, Colonel Perrone, for whose personal safety the Hellenic\r\nGovernment holds itself absolutely responsible. Such an inquiry will\r\nhave to be conducted within five days of the acceptance of these\r\ndemands;\r\n\r\n5. Capital punishment of the guilty;\r\n\r\n6. Indemnity of fifty million Italian lire (about £500,000)—to be paid\r\nwithin five days of the presentation of this Note;\r\n\r\n7. Military honours to the remains of the victims upon their embarkation\r\nat Prevesa on Italian warships.\r\n\r\n                                                              MUSSOLINI.\r\n\r\n  ROME,
