He had previously been Under-Secretary for\r\nIndia (1891-92), and Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs (1895-98),\r\nand he was well known for the distinction of his Oxford career and\r\nfor his travels in Central Asia, Persia, and the Far East. In the\r\nHouse of Commons he had further won a high reputation for industry,\r\nknowledge, and self-reliance.\r\n\r\nThe first year of his office (1899) was marked by a change in the\r\nCURRENCY, by which a gold standard was introduced, gold and currency\r\nreserves instituted, and a permanent rate of exchange fixed at\r\nsixteen pence to the rupee, or fifteen rupees to the pound sterling—a\r\nhigher value than the rupee had reached in the fluctuations of the\r\nfive previous years. Before the closing of the mints, it had sunk to\r\n13·1 pence.\r\n\r\nIn the same year Lord Curzon began his policy of efficiency by\r\nreducing the CALCUTTA MUNICIPALITY from seventy-five to fifty,\r\ncutting out twenty-five of the elected members, in spite of strong\r\nprotests on the part of the Indian electors.\r\n\r\nHe also began to earn an enviable unpopularity among certain classes\r\nof Anglo-Indians for his characteristic vigour in denouncing a\r\nBritish battalion, some privates of which were believed to have\r\noutraged a native woman to death in RANGOON and remained undetected.\r\n\r\nThe year 1900 was a season of terrible FAMINE, especially in the\r\nCentral Provinces. About 5,500,000 people came on relief works, and\r\nfamine was followed by cholera.[1] At the same time the Punjab LAND\r\nALIENATION ACT was passed, forbidding the transference of land to any\r\nbut agriculturists, the intention being to prevent the expropriation\r\nof peasants by money-lenders.\r\n\r\nLORD WELBY’S COMMISSION on Indian Expenditure issued their reports,\r\nbut the majority report suggested no important changes of taxation\r\nbeyond the transference of charges amounting to £293,000 a year to\r\nthe Imperial Exchequer. Their recommendation that England should\r\ncontribute £50,000 to the expenses of the India Office was not\r\ncarried out.\r\n\r\nIn 1901 the NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE was created, and in the\r\nfollowing year LORD KITCHENER was appointed Commander-in-Chief, the\r\nEducation Commission, presided over by Sir Thomas Raleigh, published\r\nits Report (Sir Guru Das Banerjee writing a Note of Dissent), and the\r\nPOLICE COMMISSION began to sit under Sir Andrew Fraser (afterwards\r\nLieut.-Governor of Bengal).\r\n\r\nIn the same year Lord Curzon increased his unpopularity among the\r\nclass of Anglo-Indians above mentioned, by punishing the 9TH LANCERS,\r\nbecause at Sialkot two privates were believed to have beaten to death\r\na native cook who refused to procure a native woman for them; they\r\nremained undetected.\r\n\r\nThe next year (1903) opened with a great DURBAR AT DELHI, the\r\nestimated cost of which was £180,000, and the real cost probably at\r\nleast £200,000, apart from the local expenses of provinces and Native\r\nStates. The TIBET expedition started in the same year.\r\n\r\nMore important than either of these events for the history of India\r\nwas the REDUCTION OF THE SALT TAX, or more properly, the reduction of\r\nthe price of salt under the Government monopoly. Between this year\r\nand 1907 it was reduced from 2 rupees 8 annas per maund to 1 rupee (a\r\nmaund = 82·29 lbs.).[2]\r\n\r\nLord Curzon’s office was now renewed for a further uncertain term,\r\nbelieved to be two years. But before his departure for six months’\r\nleave in 1904, he had already reduced his popularity among the\r\neducated classes of India. By the OFFICIAL SECRETS ACT, he extended\r\nthe Acts of 1889 and 1897 so as to include information upon civil\r\naffairs and matters of fact among the offences, as well as military\r\nsecrets and newspaper criticism, “likely to bring the Government or\r\nconstituted authority into suspicion or contempt.” As the burden of\r\nproof was thrown on the accused, and it was unnecessary to establish\r\ncriminal intention for conviction, this Act limited newspapers to the\r\nsupply of such information as the Government pleased.\r\n\r\nIn the same year an attempt was made to raise the standard of higher\r\neducation by the UNIVERSITIES ACT. The main object was to induce the\r\nfive Universities of Calcutta, Madras, Bombay, Lahore, and Allahabad\r\nto undertake instruction and supervision as well as examination, to\r\nwhich their function had been limited at first. It was laid down\r\nthat all students at a University must be members of an affiliated\r\ncollege, and changes were introduced into the constitution of the\r\nSenates, which were now to be largely composed of the Chancellor’s\r\nnominees and _ex-officio_ members—High Court Judges, Bishops,\r\nmembers of Executive Councils, the provincial Directors of Public\r\nInstruction, and professors of Government and missionary colleges. It\r\nwas complained that these provisions destroyed the independence of\r\nthe Universities, and, owing to the increased expense, much reduced\r\nthe number of students able to compete for degrees. On the other\r\nhand, it is maintained, and I believe justly, that the standard of\r\nlearning in its higher branches has been considerably advanced since\r\nthe Act among the affiliated colleges.\r\n\r\nA few sentences may be quoted from Lord Curzon’s BUDGET SPEECH in\r\nMarch of this year (1904), as showing his general attitude towards\r\neducated Indians and their demands:—\r\n\r\n  “I sympathize most deeply with the aspirations of the Indians\r\n  towards greater national unity, and with their desire to play a\r\n  part in the public life of the country. But I do not think that\r\n  the salvation of India is to be sought on the field of politics\r\n  at the present stage of her development.... The highest ranks\r\n  of civil employment in India must as a general rule be held by\r\n  Englishmen, for the reason that they possess, partly by heredity,\r\n  partly by up-bringing, and partly by education, the knowledge of\r\n  the principles of government, the habits of mind, the vigour of\r\n  character, which are essential for the task, and that, the rule\r\n  of India being a British rule, and every other rule being in the\r\n  circumstances of the case impossible, the tone and standard should\r\n  be set by those who have created and are responsible for it.”[3]\r\n\r\nHe further went on to maintain that on salaries of £800 a year and\r\nupward, 1263 government servants were Europeans, 15 Eurasians, and\r\n92 Indians; while on salaries between £60 and £800, there were 5205\r\nEuropeans, 5420 Eurasians, and 16,283 Indians. These figures were,\r\nhowever, severely analysed by Mr. Gokhale in his Budget speech of\r\n1905.\r\n\r\nIt was held by educated Indians that a Government Resolution of May\r\n24, 1904, carrying this statement of policy into effect, tended to\r\nexclude Indians from the higher branches of the service, and stood in\r\ncontradiction to QUEEN VICTORIA’S PROCLAMATION for India in 1858, in\r\nwhich occur the following two clauses:—\r\n\r\n  “We hold ourselves bound to the natives of our Indian territories\r\n  by the same obligations of duty which bind us to all our\r\n  other subjects; and those obligations we shall faithfully and\r\n  conscientiously fulfil.\r\n\r\n  “And it is our further will that, so far as may be, our subjects,\r\n  of whatever race or creed, be freely and impartially admitted to\r\n  offices in our service, the duties of which they may be qualified,\r\n  by their education, ability, and integrity, duly to discharge.”\r\n\r\nAccordingly, at the meeting of the National Congress in Bombay at\r\nthe end of this year, the first resolution was in protest against\r\nthe EXCLUSION OF INDIANS from the higher grades of the Service.\r\nThe other resolutions, showing the tendency of the time, included\r\nprotests against the increasing military expenditure, especially upon\r\nthe Tibet expedition, and demands for wider education, technical\r\nschools, a Permanent Land Settlement, police reform in accordance\r\nwith the Commission of 1903, the separation of judicial and executive\r\nfunctions throughout the Civil Service, simultaneous examinations\r\nfor the Service in England and India, and part payment by England\r\nof the cost of the India Office in Whitehall. SIR HENRY COTTON,\r\nChief Commissioner of Assam from 1896 to 1902, was President of the\r\nCongress that year, and he was deputed to lay the resolutions before\r\nthe Viceroy in person. But Lord Curzon refused to receive him.\r\n\r\nOn February 11, 1905, Lord Curzon addressed the CONVOCATION OF\r\nCALCUTTA UNIVERSITY with a dissertation upon truthfulness and other\r\nvirtues—\r\n\r\n  “I hope I am making no false or arrogant claim,” he said, “when\r\n  I say that the highest ideal of truth is to a large extent a\r\n  Western conception. I do not thereby mean to claim that Europeans\r\n  are universally or even generally truthful, still less do I mean\r\n  that Asiatics deliberately or habitually deviate from the truth.\r\n  The one proposition would be absurd, the other insulting. But\r\n  undoubtedly truth took a high place in the moral codes of the West\r\n  before it had been similarly honoured in the East, where craftiness\r\n  and diplomatic wile have always been held in much repute. We may\r\n  prove it by the common innuendo that lurks in the words ‘Oriental\r\n  diplomacy,’ by which is meant something rather tortuous and\r\n  hypersubtle. The same may be seen in Oriental literature. In your\r\n  epics truth will often be extolled as a virtue; but quite as often\r\n  it is attended with some qualification, and very often praise is\r\n  given to successful deception practised with honest aim.”\r\n\r\nThe Viceroy, addressing his Bengali audience, went on to say that “he\r\nknew no country where mare’s-nests were more prolific than here”;\r\nand he warned them especially against flattery and vituperation, and\r\nafterwards against eloquence.\r\n\r\n  “In India,” he said, “there are two sets of people, the reticent\r\n  and the eloquent. I dare say you know to which class the people in\r\n  this part of the country belong. I am sometimes lost in admiration\r\n  at the facility with which they speak in a foreign language, and I\r\n  envy the accomplishment. All I say to you is, do not presume upon\r\n  this talent.”\r\n\r\nTowards the conclusion of the speech, he introduced the following\r\nsentences:—\r\n\r\n  “Learn that the true salvation of India will not come from\r\n  without, but must be created within. It will not be given you\r\n  by enactment of the British Parliament, or of any Parliament at\r\n  all.... Be true Indians—that is the prompting of nationality.... In\r\n  India I see the claim constantly advanced that a man is not merely\r\n  a Bengali, or an Uriya, or a Mahratta, or a Sikh, but a member of\r\n  the Indian nation. I do not think it can yet be said that there is\r\n  any Indian nation, though in the distant future some approach to it\r\n  may be evolved. However that may be, the Indian is most certainly a\r\n  member of the British Empire.”[4]\r\n\r\nNeither these contradictory remarks on nationality, nor the Viceroy’s\r\nwell-intentioned exposition of the national tendency to deceit, were\r\nreceived by the audience and their friends in a properly chastened\r\nspirit. But the _Amrita Bazar Patrika_, next to the _Bengalee_,\r\nperhaps the most influential Indian paper in Calcutta, contented\r\nitself with the following extract from Lord Curzon’s book, called\r\n“Problems of the Far East” (p. 155 of the edition quoted), where,\r\nwriting of his conversation with the President of the Korean Foreign\r\nOffice, he said:—\r\n\r\n  “Having been warned not to say I was only thirty-three, when he\r\n  put me the straight question, ‘How old are you?’ I unhesitatingly\r\n  responded, ‘Forty.’ ‘I presume you are a near relative of the Queen\r\n  of England?’ (asked the President). ‘No,’ I replied, ‘I am not.’\r\n  But I was fain to add, ‘I am, however, as yet an unmarried man,’\r\n  with which unscrupulous suggestion I completely regained the old\r\n  gentleman’s favour.”\r\n\r\nThe quotation was regarded as apt, but the passage was only a joke,\r\nand it must be remembered that Lord Curzon had not claimed that\r\nEuropeans are universally or even generally truthful. He had called\r\nthat proposition absurd.\r\n\r\nThe speech itself would probably have been soon forgotten if it\r\nhad not been connected in the popular mind with the greatest and\r\nmost disastrous of Lord Curzon’s schemes for promoting his ideal of\r\nefficiency—the PARTITION OF BENGAL.\r\n\r\nIt had long been evident that the Province of Bengal, if the\r\nlarge outlying districts of Orissa, Behar, and Chota Nagpur were\r\nincluded, was too large for one administration. It contained close\r\nupon 80,000,000 souls. But of this amount Bengal Proper counted for\r\nonly 43,000,000. The next largest of the districts was Behar, with\r\n21,500,000. Two things were possible and would have been gladly\r\naccepted—either to form a new province out of the western districts\r\nof Behar, Chota Nagpur, and Orissa, with a capital at Patna or\r\nRanchi, relieving Bengal of a population of about 33,000,000; or\r\nto have elevated Bengal into a Governorship on the same standing\r\nas Bombay and Madras, under a Governor appointed directly from\r\nEngland instead of a Lieut.-Governor appointed out of the Indian\r\nCivil Service; and at the same time to have organized the outlying\r\ndistricts as Commissionerships, responsible either to the Crown, or\r\nto the Governor of Bengal. Either of these two main schemes would\r\nhave been accepted without question by the enormous majority of the\r\ninhabitants, and the chief principles of the second were favoured by\r\nMr. Brodrick (Lord Midleton), at that time Secretary of State for\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nLord Curzon, however, was determined to cut Bengal Proper and\r\nthe Bengali-speaking community in two, giving 25,000,000 of the\r\npopulation to the new Province of Eastern Bengal and Assam with a\r\nnew capital at Dacca, and 18,000,000 of the population to a Province\r\nstill to be called Bengal, with the old capital of Calcutta, and\r\nbound up with the outlying districts of Behar, Chota Nagpur, and\r\nOrissa, all of which differ from Bengal in race, language, and\r\ncivilization, as does Assam. Under this division, the populations of\r\nthe two new Provinces are approximately 54,000,000 in Bengal, and\r\n31,000,000 in Eastern Bengal and Assam.[5]\r\n\r\nWhen Partition on these lines was first proposed, it excited\r\nstrong protest, not only among the Hindu population of Bengal, but\r\namong many Civil Servants and Anglo-Indian papers, also among the\r\nMohammedans of Eastern Bengal, who are Bengalis by race, but number\r\nthree-fifths of the population, and, therefore, might be expected to\r\nwelcome the change, especially as they were promised considerable\r\nadvantages under the new administration. Large numbers of public\r\nmeetings were held throughout Bengal to protest against the\r\nmeasure, and petitions were sent to the British Parliament. As the\r\nBritish authorities paid no attention to these representations, the\r\n“Swadeshi” (literally “Our own Country”) movement was started for the\r\nexclusive use of native productions, in the hope that a boycott on\r\nBritish goods might at last induce public opinion in England to take\r\nnotice of an Indian grievance. As Mr. John Morley said, when speaking\r\nas Secretary of State for India in the House of Commons, February 26,\r\n1906: “I am bound to say, nothing was ever worse done in disregard to\r\nthe feeling and opinion of the majority of the people concerned.”\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Lord Curzon accomplished the Partition by an unexpected\r\nPROCLAMATION from Simla on September 1, 1905, appointing Sir Andrew\r\nFraser Lieut.-Governor in Calcutta, and Sir Bampfylde Fuller\r\nLieut.-Governor in Dacca, both being entire strangers to Bengal. The\r\nPartition came into force on October 16, 1905—a day observed as a\r\nfast of humiliation and prayer throughout the Provinces.\r\n\r\nIn the same month MR. GOKHALE and LALA LAJPAT RAI came to England as\r\nCongress Delegates, to lay the demands of the constitutional reform\r\nparty before English audiences. Lala Lajpat Rai also visited America.\r\n\r\nBefore the Partition was proclaimed, Lord Curzon had submitted his\r\nRESIGNATION (August 12, 1905), owing to a difference of opinion\r\nwith Lord Kitchener over the appointment of a new “Military Supply\r\nMember” to the Viceroy’s Council; and, in reality, over the position\r\nof the Commander-in-Chief and the Military Supply Member with regard\r\nto the Governor-General in Council. The difference does not concern\r\nus, except that, as the Conservative Home Government supported Lord\r\nKitchener’s view, and thus drove Lord Curzon to resign, it was widely\r\nbelieved that Mr. Brodrick accepted the Partition the more readily as\r\na salve to Lord Curzon’s feelings.[6]\r\n\r\nThe EARL OF MINTO was at once appointed to succeed, but Lord Curzon\r\nremained to nearly the end of the year, partly in order to welcome\r\nthe Prince and Princess of Wales on their visit to India. In his\r\nfarewell speech at Simla (September 30, 1905) he said:—\r\n\r\n  “If I were asked to sum up my work in a single word, I would\r\n  say ‘Efficiency.’ That has been our gospel, the keynote of our\r\n  administration.”[7]\r\n\r\nNo one has questioned his industry and personal devotion. During his\r\nseven years’ tenure, he instituted Commissions on plague, famine,\r\nirrigation, universities, and police; he organized departments of\r\nCommerce and Industry, and of Imperial Customs; he endeavoured to\r\nintroduce elasticity into the Land Assessment; he revolutionized\r\nour Frontier policy; and he did more for the preservation of\r\nIndian history, architecture, and ancient memorials than any of\r\nhis predecessors. All this in addition to the other changes and\r\nundertakings mentioned above.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of MR. JOHN MORLEY to the India Office (December,\r\n1905) was received with the utmost enthusiasm by the country, but,\r\nunfortunately, Lord Curzon’s industrious devotion to efficiency,\r\nwithout consideration of the prejudices or reasonable desires of\r\nthe people concerned, had sown the seed for the irritation and\r\ndisturbances of the next two years. The first signs of unrest\r\nnaturally appeared in Eastern Bengal, where the SWADESHI movement had\r\nbeen instituted as a protest against the Partition. SIR BAMPFYLDE\r\nFULLER found himself at once involved in difficulties about the\r\nboycott of foreign goods, public meetings, and the participation of\r\nschoolboys and students in the political questions that occupied\r\nall minds. On April 14, 1906, the Bengal Provincial Conference\r\nwas dispersed with violence by the police at Barisal. Bodies of\r\npunitive police and Gurkhas were quartered in several small towns\r\nand villages at their expense. Schools were deprived of their grants\r\nand the right to compete for scholarships. A circular was issued\r\ncurtailing the right of public meeting, and suppressing processions\r\nand the cry of “Bande Mataram.” In another circular Sir Bampfylde\r\nFuller laid it down that a fixed proportion of Government posts\r\nshould be reserved for Mohammedans, and, until that proportion had\r\nbeen reached, no qualified Mohammedan candidate should be rejected\r\nin favour of a Hindu candidate, merely because the latter had\r\nsuperior qualifications (May 25, 1906). Finally, owing to some petty\r\ndisturbances by schoolboys at Serajganj, in the Pabna district\r\n(November 15, 1905), the Lieut.-Governor who had already severely\r\npunished the two schools in the place, and posted punitive police\r\nthere, demanded that they should be disaffiliated from Calcutta\r\nUniversity. The Government asked him to reconsider the case, and he\r\nresigned (August 4, 1906), being succeeded by Sir Lancelot Hare.\r\n\r\nThe next month was marked by a characteristic description of a\r\nsimple incident by Calcutta correspondents to the English press. On\r\nSeptember 5th MR. SURENDRA NATH BANERJEA, twice President of the\r\nNational Congress and now editor of the _Bengalee_ newspaper in\r\nCalcutta, was honoured by a common Indian ceremony of “benediction”\r\nin a private house. It was an affair of an umbrella, a chaplet,\r\ngarlands, and the recitation of verses from the Vedas. It is almost\r\nimpossible for even a casual visitor to India to escape a score of\r\nvery similar performances. Yet the correspondents on whom England\r\nchiefly depends for Indian news described this as a solemn CORONATION\r\nof Mr. Banerjea as India’s Emperor, as if to rouse the suspicions and\r\nrage of the English people into sensational panic.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1907, local disturbances occurred in Eastern\r\nBengal and the Punjab. Meetings to protest against the Partition\r\nhad been continually held in Eastern Bengal, and in the first week\r\nof March the Nawab Salimulla of Dacca visited the small town of\r\nCOMILLA in order to encourage counter-demonstrations on the part of\r\nthe Mohammedans, over whom he claimed great influence. During his\r\nvisit small riots took place between Hindu and Mohammedan crowds;\r\na Mohammedan was killed and one or two Hindus. By one means or\r\nanother, the report was circulated through the country that the\r\nIndian Government was favouring the Mohammedan population and would\r\ninflict no punishment for the looting of Hindu shops or the abduction\r\nof Hindu women, especially widows. Accordingly, shops were looted,\r\nHindu widows abducted, and the cases of outrage upon women by gangs\r\nincreased in number.\r\n\r\nIn the third week of April further disturbances broke out at\r\nJAMALPUR, another small town in Eastern Bengal, where the Hindus,\r\nduring a festival, were set upon by Mohammedan rowdies, who\r\ndesecrated a temple and maintained panic in the district for the next\r\nfew weeks.\r\n\r\nThe troubles that arose in the PUNJAB, about the same time, were\r\nlargely agricultural in origin. There had been a large increase in\r\nthe land-assessment, together with a sudden rise in the irrigation\r\nrates, especially on the Bari-Doab canal. The Punjab Legislative\r\nCouncil had also brought forward a COLONIZATION BILL altering the\r\nagreements by which colonists held reclaimed land, especially in the\r\nChenab Colony, under the Act of 1893. Many relations of these tenants\r\nwere enlisted in Sikh and other Indian regiments, and ultimately\r\nLord Minto withheld his consent from the Bill. The question of the\r\nirrigation dues was also postponed for a year.\r\n\r\nMeantime, Indian opinion was constantly irritated by the abuse and\r\nridicule poured upon educated Indians in the “CIVIL AND MILITARY\r\nGAZETTE,” the leading Anglo-Indian paper of Lahore. They were spoken\r\nof as “babbling B.A.’s,” “base-born B.A.’s,” “an unhonoured nobility\r\nof the school,” “serfs,” “beggars on horseback,” “servile classes,”\r\n“a class that carries a stigma,” and so on. When petitioned twice to\r\nput an end to this kind of journalism as stirring up strife between\r\nthe races, Sir Denzil Ibbetson, at that time Lieut.-Governor of the\r\nPunjab, regretted the tone of the articles but refused to prosecute.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, two Indian papers in Lahore were\r\nprosecuted—“INDIA” for republishing a letter from America containing\r\na seditious appeal to the native troops, and the “PUNJABEE” for its\r\ncomments on a case of “Begar,” or forced labour, which was supposed\r\nto have led to the death of two villagers compelled to work for an\r\nofficial. In the case of _India_, the proprietor and editor, Pindi\r\nDas, was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment, and the printer, Dina\r\nNath, to two years. In the _Punjabee_ case, the proprietor, Lala\r\nJaswant Rai, was sentenced, on appeal, to a fine of 1000 rupees and\r\nsix months’ imprisonment, and the editor, K. K. Athavale, to a fine\r\nof 200 rupees and six months’ imprisonment.\r\n\r\nAfter the judgment of the Chief Court on appeal was given in the\r\n_Punjabee_ case (April 16, 1907), the prisoners on their way to gaol\r\nwere met by an enthusiastic crowd, and there was some disturbance,\r\nfor which three young men were arrested.\r\n\r\nThis disturbance was followed by a more serious riot at RAWAL PINDI,\r\nthe greatest military cantonment of the north-west district of India\r\n(May 2nd). In the previous February a young and then unknown Indian,\r\nnamed AJIT SINGH, had started an “Indian Patriots’ Association,”\r\nchiefly to deal with the agricultural grievances above mentioned.\r\nVarious meetings were held, and at Lyallpur (March 22nd) LALA LAJPAT\r\nRAI, who had no connection with the Association, but was well known\r\nin Lahore as a religious and social reformer in the Arya Samaj,\r\naddressed an agricultural audience, in a speech in which he ventured\r\nto declare that officials are servants of the public. Ajit Singh also\r\nspoke, and this was the only occasion on which the two men were on\r\nthe same platform.\r\n\r\nMeetings were held at Rawal Pindi, on April 7th and 21st. On the\r\nlatter day Ajit Singh made a violent attack upon the increase of\r\nland assessment, calling on the peasants to cease cultivation until\r\nthe amount was reduced. Mr. Hansraj Sawhny, a prominent pleader, in\r\nthe chair, checked the speaker, who went away in a rage. But shortly\r\nafterwards, Mr. Agnew, the Deputy Commissioner, summoned the chairman\r\nand two other lawyers, for an enquiry into the matter. On the very\r\nmorning of the enquiry, the proceedings were postponed, owing to a\r\ntelegram from Sir Denzil Ibbetson, and the large crowd which had\r\ncollected, instead of dispersing, swept down a main road, destroyed\r\nand burnt some furniture from a mission house and church, and damaged\r\nsome gardens and houses of Europeans, together with a Hindu workshop,\r\nwhere the men were on strike. The police did not appear, but troops\r\npatrolled the town later.\r\n\r\nFor this riot, six prominent lawyers were arrested and kept in gaol,\r\nno bail being allowed, through the hot weather from May 3rd to\r\nOctober 1st, when they were acquitted and discharged, the magistrate\r\ndeclaring the evidence was fabricated. In consequence of this\r\nunmerited imprisonment, one of them has since died.\r\n\r\nAbout sixty other persons were arrested, and five were condemned,\r\nthree of them to seven years’ imprisonment for riot and arson. The\r\ntrial took place before Mr. A. E. Martineau, Sessions Judge of Delhi,\r\nas Special Magistrate, and the terms of his judgment did much to\r\nrestore Indian confidence in British justice.\r\n\r\nTHE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE OUTBREAK OF THE MUTINY (May 10th),\r\nhad been fixed by some Anglo-Indian journalists as the date for a\r\nprobable rising against the British, and, owing to their warnings,\r\npreparations were made for withdrawing the British residents,\r\nespecially in the Punjab towns, into the forts. But in spite of all\r\nthat prophecy could do, no outbreak occurred.\r\n\r\nHowever, on May 9th, Lala Lajpat Rai was suddenly DEPORTED from\r\nLahore without notice, charge, or trial, and conveyed to the fort in\r\nMandalay. Ajit Singh was similarly deported from Amritsar.\r\n\r\nWhen questioned in the Commons as to this breach of “Habeas Corpus,”\r\nMr. John Morley pleaded the powers of deportation granted by a\r\nREGULATION OF 1818, under which thirty-two persons were at the moment\r\ndetained in restraint.\r\n\r\nOn May 11th, Lord Minto issued a PROCLAMATION limiting the RIGHT OF\r\nPUBLIC MEETING in parts of the Punjab and Eastern Bengal. Under this\r\nOrdinance seven days’ written notice was required before a meeting,\r\nthe meeting might be prohibited by a magistrate, and the police were\r\nto attend.\r\n\r\nOn May 27th, the Viceroy refused his assent to the Punjab\r\nColonization Bill above described.\r\n\r\nMeantime, on behalf of the Home Department of the Government of\r\nIndia, SIR HERBERT RISLEY issued a CIRCULAR with regard to the\r\npolitical behaviour of schoolboys, teachers, students, and professors\r\n(May 6th). It ordained that where schoolboys associated themselves\r\nwith political movements grants-in-aid should be withdrawn from the\r\nschool, and the privilege of competing for scholarships withheld;\r\nuniversities were not to recognize the school, nor to admit its\r\ncandidates to matriculation. Schoolmasters were allowed by the\r\nCircular “to have a right to their own opinions as much as any one\r\nelse,” but should be visited by “disciplinary action” if their\r\nutterances endangered the orderly development of the boys, or were\r\nsubversive of their respect for authority. In the case of colleges,\r\nstudents were allowed to attend meetings, but if they became active\r\nin politics, the privileges of affiliation should be withdrawn.\r\nProfessors were permitted more latitude, but if they encouraged\r\nstudents to attend political meetings, the university or the\r\nGovernment should intervene.\r\n\r\nThe BUDGET for the year 1907-8 was estimated at £75,012,800 revenue,\r\nand £74,238,100 expenditure, giving a surplus of £774,700. In his\r\nBudget speech of June 6th, Mr. John Morley made the important\r\nannouncement that TWO NOMINATED INDIANS were to be added to the INDIA\r\nCOUNCIL in Whitehall, and gave the names of Mr. K. G. Gupta, as\r\nrepresenting the Hindus, and Mr. S. H. Bilgrami, as representing the\r\nMohammedans.\r\n\r\nAt the same time he announced a SCHEME OF REFORMS, proposed by the\r\nIndian Government at Simla, to be submitted to the Local Governments\r\nfor criticism. In brief, the scheme included:—\r\n\r\n(1) The institution of an “Imperial Advisory Council,” consisting of\r\nabout sixty members, all appointed by the Viceroy, including twenty\r\nruling chiefs, “with a suitable number of territorial magnates of\r\nevery province where landholders of sufficient dignity and status\r\nare to be found.” This council was to be summoned at the Viceroy’s\r\npleasure, and to hold nothing but private, informal, and confidential\r\nmeetings, having no legislative powers of any sort.\r\n\r\n(2) Provincial Advisory Councils—apparently seven—of smaller size,\r\nbut consisting of the local Imperial Councillors and representatives\r\nof lesser landholders, industry, commerce, capital, and the\r\nprofessional classes, all nominated by the head of the Local\r\nGovernment; their functions also to be entirely consultative.\r\n\r\n(3) The enlargement of the Viceroy’s Legislative Council from\r\ntwenty-four to fifty-three by the inclusion of more Viceroy’s\r\nnominees, two representatives of the Chambers of Commerce, two\r\nMohammedans elected by rotation from Mohammedan districts, seven\r\nlandholders elected by the landed magnates, and seven instead of\r\nfour members elected by the non-official members of the Legislative\r\nCouncils. The last point may appear like a concession to popular\r\nrepresentation, but seven out of fifty-three is not so powerful a\r\nfraction as four out of twenty-four.\r\n\r\n(4) The enlargement of the Provincial Legislative Councils, but this\r\nproposal was left vague, beyond a few suggestions.\r\n\r\nSome miscellaneous points in the history of the year remain to be\r\nnoticed.\r\n\r\nThe official return of deaths from PLAGUE during the first four\r\nmonths of the year (1907) amounted to 642,000, and the total deaths\r\nfrom plague since its first appearance in 1896 up to April, 1907,\r\nwere 5,250,000.\r\n\r\nOn August 7th, and again on October 2nd, disturbances arose in\r\nCollege Square and Beadon Square in Calcutta, and in the same city a\r\npopular speaker named BEPIN CHANDRA PAL was sentenced to six months’\r\nimprisonment (September 11th) for refusing to give evidence in the\r\nprosecution of the Indian paper, _Bande Mataram_. When summoned as\r\nwitness before the magistrate, Mr. Kingsford, he replied:—\r\n\r\n  “I have conscientious objections against taking part in a\r\n  prosecution which I believe to be unjust and injurious to the cause\r\n  of popular freedom and the interests of public peace.” (August 26.)\r\n\r\nTwo special commissions were instituted in the autumn—a\r\nDECENTRALIZATION COMMISSION, under Mr. Charles Hobhouse, at that time\r\nUnder-Secretary for India, and a FACTORY LABOUR COMMISSION, under Mr.\r\nW. T. Morrison of the Bombay Civil Service. They sat in various parts\r\nof India during the winter.\r\n\r\nIn July an agreement was announced with China, by which it was\r\nultimately arranged that China should regard 51,000 chests of OPIUM\r\nexported from India as a standard amount, this amount to be decreased\r\nyearly by one-tenth from 1908 till it disappeared in ten years,\r\nprovided that China made similar reductions in her produce.\r\n\r\nOn August 31st an ANGLO-RUSSIAN AGREEMENT was signed, dividing Persia\r\ninto Russian and British spheres of influence, with a neutral zone\r\nbetween; Afghanistan was recognized as outside Russian influence,\r\nand both Powers agreed not to send representatives to Lhassa. In\r\nsome quarters it was hoped that this Agreement would warrant a large\r\nreduction in the military expenditure of India.\r\n\r\nIn October SIR GEORGE CLARKE, lately Secretary to the Committee of\r\nImperial Defence, arrived from England as new Governor of Bombay. In\r\nthe same month MR. KEIR HARDIE, ex-leader of the Labour Party in the\r\nCommons, visited Eastern Bengal, where his private statements and\r\nconversation were misrepresented by correspondents to the English\r\nnewspapers and agencies as seditious speeches.\r\n\r\nOn November 1st a SEDITIOUS MEETINGS ACT was passed by the Viceroy in\r\nCouncil at Simla, giving Local Governments the power to “proclaim”\r\nthe whole or part of their provinces, in which case seven days’\r\nnotice in writing must be given of every public meeting, including\r\nthe assembly of twenty persons or over in a private house; the\r\nDistrict Magistrate, or Commissioner of Police was given power to\r\nprohibit such a meeting, or to direct that police should be present.\r\n\r\nMr. Gokhale and Dr. Rash Behari Ghose spoke strongly in opposition\r\nto the Bill as Indian representatives on the Council, and the Tikka\r\nSahib of Nabha, a Sikh representative of the Punjab, joined them in\r\nvoting against the measure, which was carried by a majority of nine\r\nBritish against three Indians, no other members of Council being\r\nable to attend, as the session was in Simla contrary to precedent\r\nfor important legislation.\r\n\r\nThe next week brought the full text of Mr. John Morley’s speech\r\nto his constituents at Arbroath, in defence of his Indian policy.\r\nI quote the following sentences on account of the attention they\r\nattracted:—\r\n\r\n  “Does any one want me to go to London to-morrow morning and to\r\n  send a telegram to Lord Kitchener, and tell him to disband the\r\n  Indian Army, and send home as fast as we can dispatch transports\r\n  the British contingent of the Army, and bring away the whole of the\r\n  Civil Servants?... How should we look in the face of the civilized\r\n  world if we had turned our back upon our duty and upon our task?\r\n  How should we bear the savage stings of our own consciences when,\r\n  as assuredly we should, we heard through the dark distances the\r\n  roar and scream of confusion and carnage in India?”\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Mr. Keir Hardie and one of his reported sayings in\r\nEastern Bengal, Mr. Morley said:—\r\n\r\n  “I am not at all sure that he said this, but it does not matter,\r\n  because many other people have said it—That whatever is good in\r\n  the way of self-government for Canada must be good for India. In\r\n  my view that is the most concise statement that I can imagine, and\r\n  the grossest fallacy in all politics.... You might just as well say\r\n  that, because a fur coat in Canada at certain times of the year is\r\n  a most comfortable garment, therefore a fur coat in the Deccan of\r\n  India is a sort of handy garment that you might be very happy to\r\n  wear.”\r\n\r\nA few sentences further on he added:—\r\n\r\n  “I hope that the Government of India, so long as I am connected\r\n  with it and responsible for it to Parliament and to the country,\r\n  will not be hurried by the anger of the impatient idealist. The\r\n  impatient idealist—you know him, I know him, I like him; I have\r\n  been one myself. He says, ‘You admit that so and so is right, why\r\n  don’t you do it? why don’t you do it now?’ Ah, gentlemen, how many\r\n  of the most tragic miscarriages in human history have been due to\r\n  the impatience of the idealist?\r\n\r\n  “... You would not have me see men set the prairie on fire without\r\n  arresting the hand. You would not blame me when I saw some men\r\n  smoking their pipes near powder magazines—you would not call me an\r\n  arch-coercionist if I said, ‘Away with the men, and away with the\r\n  powder.’”\r\n\r\nIn answer to those who said India was astonished at the licence\r\nextended to newspapers and speakers, he continued:—\r\n\r\n  “Orientals, they say, do not understand it. But we are not\r\n  Orientals; that is the root of the matter. We English, Scotch,\r\n  and Irish are in India because we are not Orientals.... We\r\n  are representatives, not of Oriental civilization but Western\r\n  civilization, of its methods, its principles, its practices; and I\r\n  for one will not be hurried into an excessive haste for repression\r\n  by the argument that Orientals do not understand this toleration.\r\n\r\n  “Anybody who has read history knows that the Extremist beats the\r\n  Moderate by his fire, his fiery energy, his very narrowness and\r\n  concentration. But still we hold that it would be the height of\r\n  political folly for us at this moment to refuse to do all we can to\r\n  rally the Moderates to the cause of the Government, simply because\r\n  the policy will not satisfy the Extremists. Let us, if we can,\r\n  rally the Moderates, and, if we are told that the policy will not\r\n  satisfy the Extremists, so be it; our line will remain the same.\r\n\r\n  “... Some of them (the leaders of unrest) are angry with me. Why?\r\n  Because I have not been able to give them the moon. I have got no\r\n  moon, and if I had I would not give them the moon.\r\n\r\n  “... I am not surprised that these educated Indians who read these\r\n  great masters and teachers of ours (Milton, Burke, Macaulay, and\r\n  Mill) are intoxicated with the ideas of freedom and nationality and\r\n  self-government which these great writers promulgate. Who of us can\r\n  wonder who had the privilege in the days of our youth, at college\r\n  or at home, of turning over these golden pages and seeing that\r\n  lustrous firmament dome over our youthful imaginations—who of us\r\n  can forget the intoxication and rapture with which we made friends\r\n  with these truths?... I only say this to my idealist friends,\r\n  whether Indian or European, that for every passage they can find in\r\n  the speeches or writings of these great teachers of wisdom, I will\r\n  find them a dozen passages in which, in the language of Burke, the\r\n  warning is given—‘How weary a step do those take who endeavour to\r\n  make out of a great mass a true political personality!’”\r\n\r\nAfter referring to a saying about Sir Henry Lawrence, that “no one\r\never sat at his table without learning to think more kindly of the\r\nnatives,” Mr. Morley added:—\r\n\r\n  “India is perhaps the one country—bad manners, overbearing manners\r\n  are very disagreeable in all countries—India is the only country\r\n  where bad and overbearing manners are a political crime.”\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the summer there had been some local riots and\r\ndisturbances in Southern India because at COCANADA, on the coast\r\nnorth of Madras, an Englishman was accused of having beaten a Hindu\r\nboy for shouting “Bande Mataram.” He was sentenced to a small fine\r\n(£10, including damages), and was acquitted on appeal. But this\r\nautumn, unhappily, Indian opinion was further inflamed by the results\r\nof two trials in private cases held before British juries in the\r\nPunjab. In LAHORE a British journalist was accused of having shot his\r\nbearer dead, after kicking him out of the house, revolver in hand,\r\nand was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment, the jury finding that\r\ndeath was accidental. In the other case, at RAWAL PINDI, a British\r\nassistant station-master and a Mohammedan porter admitted to having\r\nin turn outraged a Hindu woman, who was waiting for a train and\r\nwas enticed into the stationmaster’s room by threats and pretended\r\ninformation about a telegram. Both were acquitted by the jury on a\r\nplea of “consent.”\r\n\r\nIn November of this year, Mr. Dadabhai Naoroji, veteran champion\r\nof India’s cause before the English people, returned to spend his\r\nlast days in a quiet place on the coast near Bombay. Born a Bombay\r\nParsi in 1825, he had first gone to live in England just before the\r\nMutiny, but had often returned to official or other work in Baroda\r\nand Bombay. He was a member of the first Indian National Congress\r\nat its inauguration in Bombay (1885), and in the next year stood as\r\nLiberal candidate for Holborn, on which occasion Lord Salisbury told\r\nthe electors he could not believe they would vote for a “black man.”\r\nNevertheless, he was Liberal member for Central Finsbury from 1892\r\nto 1895, being the first Indian in the House of Commons. In 1892 he\r\nwas President of the Congress held at Lahore, and in 1906, in spite\r\nof his great age, he consented to be President of the Congress held\r\nat Calcutta, because it was felt that the reverence with which he\r\nwas regarded by all Indians would avert the danger of open rupture\r\nbetween the moderate and extremist parties.\r\n\r\nThis bare summary of events may, perhaps, be useful for reference,\r\nand I think it will enable readers of the following pages better to\r\nunderstand the subjects of public interest that were occupying the\r\nattention of educated Indians and of Anglo-Indians when I arrived\r\nat Bombay in October, 1907, as correspondent for the _Manchester\r\nGuardian_ and other papers.\r\n\r\nI owe my hearty thanks to all Anglo-Indian and Indian officials\r\nand friends who gave me ungrudging assistance during my visit, and\r\nespecially to Mr. S. K. Ratcliffe, lately editor of the _Statesman_\r\nin Calcutta, for reading my proofs and giving me the advantage of his\r\nexceptional knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] For an eye-witness’s account see “The Great Famine,” by Mr.\r\nVaughan Nash, at that time correspondent of the _Manchester Guardian_\r\n(Longmans: 1900).\r\n\r\n[2] The revenue from salt in 1907-8 was £3,336,900 against £4,362,706\r\nin 1906-7, but the consumption of salt went up in 1907-8 to\r\n44,289,000 maunds, compared to an average of 36,445,000 maunds for\r\nthe ten previous years.\r\n\r\n[3] “Lord Curzon in India;” selection from his speeches; with\r\nIntroduction, by Sir Thomas Raleigh.

But, in\r\nfeeling, the Diwali comes nearer to Christmastide, for it has no\r\npolitical significance, and the flames are not lighted as a defiance\r\nto the Pope of Rome, but in honour of Lakshmi, the goddess of family\r\nprosperity, who provides wealth sufficient for us, and holds a baby\r\nto the breast above her heart.\r\n\r\nSo brothers and sisters, nephews and nieces, cousins to the tenth\r\nremoval, were gathered together in the joy of a kinship that regards\r\nthe smallest trace of common blood as absolute and unquestioned claim\r\nto lifelong support under a common roof. No Workhouse or Industrial\r\nSchool for them! As long as one of the kin has pancakes and a cow,\r\nthere is always a certainty of a crumb and a sup of milk all round.\r\nIn honour of such riches and family love, the ceilings of the rooms\r\nand the verandahs fluttered with pink and yellow flags; the windows\r\nand doors were hung with festoons of orange marigolds on a string;\r\nupon the entrance pavement neat patterns in whitewash were drawn\r\nby hand-rollers; and, as the streets turned blue with evening, the\r\nchildren, draped in all the gorgeous crimsons and golds their mothers\r\ncould afford, lighted the tiny oil lamps on window-sill and doorstep,\r\nor threw the spurting fires under the very noses of sacred bulls that\r\nwander for their living from shop to shop. To be sure, other helpful\r\npowers beside Lakshmi have a share in the honour (for who can tell\r\nunder which form he loves God best?), and it is the temples of Durga\r\nand Vishnu, of Siva and Parvati, lady of the far-off mountain snow,\r\nthat make the sacred hill of Parbati outside the city sparkle like an\r\nilluminated birthday cake, for at least one night during the Diwali\r\nfeast of brotherhood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A STREET IN POONA.\r\n\r\n  [_Face p. 32._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe sad thing was that in the beautiful streets where Mahratta nobles\r\nhad built their simple palaces under the Peshwas a century ago, many\r\nof the houses now stood dark and empty, in terror of the plague.\r\nHardly eleven years had passed since the pestilence first appeared,\r\nimported from Hongkong as people thought, and in those eleven years\r\nit had killed nearly six millions of India’s inhabitants. Six\r\nmillions out of three hundred millions may not sound very much; it is\r\nonly two in every hundred spread over eleven years. But the loss\r\nwas not equally distributed, and when I was told that within those\r\neleven years the inhabitants of Poona had been reduced to nearly\r\none-third, I knew why so many homes were dark on a night of lamps\r\nand family affection. At the time, the plague was striking down from\r\ntwelve to fifteen, or at the highest twenty, so that its visitation\r\nwas regarded as light. But I remember the panic when a single case\r\nwas reported in London, or even at the more comfortable distance of\r\nMarseilles, and so it was natural to find that many families had gone\r\nto live on selected open spaces outside the city. There among rocks\r\nand withered grass they kindled their little lamps and celebrated\r\nfamily joy in any hut of wicker, matting, canvas, petroleum\r\ntins, old boxes, boards, or branches which they and the Imperial\r\nGovernment could manage to rig up between them. Many shopmen had even\r\ntransferred their little stores of grain, sweets, and cottons to this\r\ncountrified scene, and the general effect was like a scrappy Derby\r\nDay without the races.\r\n\r\nHaving crossed a bridge, to the left of which thin columns of smoke\r\nstill rose from the smouldering bodies of yesterday’s dead, I passed\r\nthrough one of these Health Camps, as official language fondly\r\ncalls them, and found before me a partly finished building of solid\r\nstone—unfinished, but with something already monastic and grave in\r\nits straight-roofed hall and line of cloistral habitations. It was\r\nthe rising home of the “Servants of India Society,” and in front of\r\nhis own small house the founder and “First Member” of the Society was\r\nstanding to receive me.\r\n\r\nMr. Gopal Krishna Gokhale is one of the very few Indians whose name\r\nis known in England to a certain number of people outside the score\r\nor two that pay attention to Indian affairs. Born a Mahratta Brahman\r\nof the highest caste and of ordinary poverty in the small town of\r\nKolhapur, he threw away the caste and retained the poverty. While\r\na student at the Elphinstone College in Bombay, he came under the\r\ninfluence of Justice Ranade, also a Mahratta Brahman and judge of\r\nthe High Court, famous already for social reform, and at that time\r\ncombining with others to establish the National Congress, which held\r\nits first meeting in 1885. Mr. Gokhale had taken his degree the year\r\nbefore. Lord Ripon had just left the country, honoured and regretted\r\namong Indians as no other Viceroy has been, and the air was full of\r\nschemes for political emancipation under the favour and encouragement\r\nof British statesmen. Among the reformers of that time, when all\r\nwere moderate, Ranade was distinguished for moderation, and when Mr.\r\nGokhale in his student days chose him as his “guru,” or spiritual\r\nguide, he fixed for life his own characteristics of moderation, and a\r\ncertain sweet reasonableness, not only of manner, but of aim.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MR. GOKHALE AND SERVANTS OF INDIA.\r\n\r\n  [_Face p. 34._\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt is common to say of a dead politician that he was devoted heart\r\nand soul to the service of his country, and, happily, it is sometimes\r\ntrue, even though that devoted service has been crowned by honours,\r\nfame, and riches. But of Mr. Gokhale who is still alive, I would\r\nsay that for every day of his manhood he has had no motive but his\r\ncountry’s service, from the day of his appointment on a salary of £60\r\na year as teacher of history and economics at the Fergusson College\r\nin Poona up to his retirement in 1902 on a pension of £20 a year, and\r\nonward through the last six years of labour, vilification, and heated\r\ncontroversy. Not a great speaker, and making no attempt at emotional\r\neloquence at a time when oratory counted for much more in India than\r\nit does now—a man who has never even contemplated any popular arts\r\nexcept his own inevitable politeness, he has won his influence upon\r\nhis country’s future simply by unreserved devotion and integrity of\r\nlife. At a moment of intense excitement during the plague riots in\r\nPoona, when Mr. Rand and Lieut. Ayerst were shot by Damodar Chapekar\r\nand his brothers as they drove into the city from Government House\r\n(June 22, 1897), he, being then in England, published charges against\r\nthe method of plague-observation by British soldiers, which on his\r\nreturn he discovered were not supported by the promised evidence, and\r\nhe offered an open apology to Lord Sandhurst and the Army. Amidst\r\nan infuriated public opinion, which believed the charges to be not\r\nonly true, but below the truth, few could have lived down such a\r\nretractation. But Mr. Gokhale lived it down.\r\n\r\nWhen the National Congress met at Benares in December, 1905, just\r\nafter the partition of Bengal, he was elected President as the safest\r\nguide in a crisis of extreme difficulty and increasing indignation.\r\nMr. John Morley had just received his appointment to the India\r\nOffice, and a few lines from Mr. Gokhale’s presidential address may\r\nbe quoted to show the hopes and fears of the time:—\r\n\r\n  “Large numbers of educated men in this country feel towards Mr.\r\n  Morley as towards a Master, and the heart hopes and yet trembles.\r\n  He, the reverent student of Burke, the disciple of Mill, the friend\r\n  and biographer of Gladstone, will he courageously apply their\r\n  principles and his own to the government of this country, or will\r\n  he too succumb to the influences of the India Office, and thus\r\n  cast a blight on hopes which his own writings have done so much to\r\n  foster? In any case his appointment indicates how favourable to our\r\n  cause the attitude of the new Ministry is.”\r\n\r\nFor two or three years past Mr. Gokhale had represented the\r\nPresidency of Bombay as one of the elected Indians upon the Viceroy’s\r\nLegislative Council, and when I first met him at Poona, as I have\r\ndescribed, he had just returned from the Council at Simla, in\r\nwhich the Seditious Meetings Bill was approved.[8] Before the\r\nViceroy and the rest of the British majority, he had opposed the\r\nBill with a restrained but overwhelming plea for the common rights\r\nof freedom, as English people understand them. In one significant\r\npassage, after referring to “the malignant activity of certain\r\nunscrupulous correspondents” who had recently been trying to lash the\r\nBritish public into a panic by false versions of events and private\r\nutterances, he added:—\r\n\r\n  “The saddest part of the whole thing is that the Secretary of State\r\n  for India has fallen a victim to these grievous misrepresentations.\r\n  Possessing no personal knowledge of the people of this country,\r\n  and overwhelmed with a sense of the vast responsibilities of his\r\n  office, he has allowed his vision to be obscured, and his sense of\r\n  proportion to be warped. From time to time he has let fall ominous\r\n  hints in the House of Commons, and more than once he has spoken as\r\n  though some great trouble were brewing in India and the country\r\n  were on the eve of a dark disaster. My Lord, in these circumstances\r\n  the passing of a Bill like the present, and in such hot haste,\r\n  is bound to have the effect of confirming the false impression\r\n  which has been already created in England, and this cannot fail\r\n  to intensify and deepen still further the sense of injustice and\r\n  injury, and the silent resentment with which my countrymen have\r\n  been watching the course of events during the last few months.”\r\n\r\nHere, on the edge of the rocky country west of Poona, close beside\r\nthe Fergusson College for Indians, with which he had been so long\r\nconnected, he had laid the foundation of his “Servants of India\r\nSociety” two years before, and in the two-roomed cells about a dozen\r\nKnights of the Order were already living. They were men prepared,\r\nin the language of the Society’s rules, “to devote their lives to\r\nthe cause of the country in a religious spirit, and to promote,\r\nby all constitutional means, the national interests of the Indian\r\npeople.” The object of the Society is to train the Servants as\r\nnational missionaries, ready to visit any part of India at the order\r\nof the First Member and Council, in the hope of creating a deep\r\nand passionate love of the country, organizing political teaching,\r\npromoting goodwill among the different races, assisting education,\r\nespecially of women, and raising the people who live below even the\r\nlowest caste.\r\n\r\nEach Servant of India remains under close training for five years,\r\nbut out of the five years he spends two in visiting various parts of\r\nIndia, so as to know the people’s needs at first hand. Even when his\r\nnovitiate is complete, he is required to live two months every year\r\nin the Headquarters, and, like the Monastic Orders, all the members\r\ntake vows—to give their best to the service of the country; to earn\r\nno money for themselves and seek no personal advantage; to regard\r\nall Indians as brothers, without distinction of caste or creed; to\r\nengage in no personal quarrel; and to lead a pure personal life. In\r\nthis Order, as in other similar societies throughout India, there\r\nis a growing tendency to celibate consecration, like the Roman\r\npriesthood’s. But the last vow does not exclude marriage. In fact,\r\nthere is a provision that every member under training shall have his\r\npersonal expenses borne by the Society, but be granted £2 a month\r\nfor his family, if he has one, and that after his novitiate the full\r\nmember shall bear the expenses of himself and family out of a grant\r\nof £3 6_s._ 8_d._ (Rs. 50) a month, with an extra allowance for the\r\ninsurance of each child as it comes.\r\n\r\nThe merely learned side of the Order is represented by a large\r\nlibrary, already containing rows on rows of the many great books\r\nthat Indians and Englishmen have written on India, together with a\r\nselection from the history of liberty in all countries. That is the\r\nlibrary’s distinction. Beginning with England herself, and passing\r\nright down the glorious roll to the Russia of 1905, it has here\r\ncollected the long record of man’s gradual and hard-won conquest of\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nSocial reform is certainly one side of the Society’s work. To\r\nfree the laborious peoples of India from the bondage they lay on\r\nthemselves in harassing ritual, immature marriages, exclusion from\r\nlife’s decencies of some fifty millions, who eat dead animals and\r\nthink they commit mortal sin if their shadow touches a Brahman—to\r\nfree the common people gradually from these obsolete ways, and to\r\nspread among them the first inkling of knowledge, for which the\r\nGovernment does not yet afford the money—these are objects common to\r\nmost Indian reformers, and natural under the tradition of Ranade.\r\nSuch purposes are missionary in the ordinary sense, like the efforts\r\nof our missionary societies or university settlements. Only those who\r\nare dubious about all missionary efforts could criticize them. I am\r\ndubious myself, only because no one has ever deliberately missionized\r\nme without driving me further into sin, if only as a relief from his\r\npresence. For I keep in my mind that saying of Thoreau’s:—\r\n\r\n  “If I knew for a certainty that a man was coming to my house with\r\n  the conscious design of doing me good, I should run for my life as\r\n  from that dry and parching wind of the African deserts, called the\r\n  simoom, which fills the mouth and nose and ears and eyes with dust\r\n  till you are suffocated, for fear I should get some of his good\r\n  done to me—some of its virus mingled with my blood.”\r\n\r\nBut I think the cause of all this peril and terror really lies,\r\nnot in the good that might be done to myself, but in a certain\r\ndisintegration in the missionary nature, an over-maturity or\r\nstaleness of virtue that rots the good before I get it. If it were\r\npossible for the missionary spirit to move on the same insecure plane\r\nof pitfalls with me, unconscious of any salutary purpose beyond its\r\nown difficult salvation, one might possibly escape its virus without\r\nrunning in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nThat is why the frankly political side of the Society is so welcome.\r\nPolitics, being less intimate to the soul, appear less dangerous for\r\na teacher than social reform or philanthropy, in which some kind of\r\nmoral or class superiority is nearly always assumed. Regarding the\r\nSociety’s attitude towards the British Government, I had better quote\r\nfrom its own little book of rules:—\r\n\r\n  “Its members frankly accept the British connection, as ordained,\r\n  in the inscrutable dispensation of Providence, for India’s good.\r\n  Self-government on the lines of the English colonies is their goal.\r\n  This goal, they recognize, cannot be attained without years of\r\n  earnest and patient work and sacrifice worthy of the cause.”\r\n\r\nMany have smiled over that “inscrutable dispensation of Providence.”\r\nNaturally, I took it for irony myself, though I felt that irony was\r\nout of tune with the Society’s regulations. But it is not irony.\r\nMr. Gokhale’s nature is too direct, his purpose too simple in its\r\nintensity, for the ironic bypaths.\r\n\r\nI was dining that night with such of the Servants of India as had not\r\ngone home for the family festival. Mr. Paranjbye was there too—Senior\r\nWrangler of his year, Fellow of St. John’s, present Head of the\r\nFergusson College close by, famous among European mathematicians, and\r\nalmost tolerated in the Anglo-Indian society of Poona for his skill\r\nat lawn tennis. Mr. Kelkar had come as well—editor of the _Mahratta_,\r\na leader in the Extremist camp, Mr. Tilak’s vigilant captain. And\r\na few more Brahmans and others sat with us, not too sacrificial\r\nin purity to eat beside a carnivorous European. That “inscrutable\r\ndispensation” was discussed amid laughter, but Mr. Gokhale retained\r\nhis accustomed serenity. He had written the words with entire\r\nseriousness. The dispensations of Providence were inscrutable, but\r\nstill he believed the British connection was ordained for India’s\r\ngood. It had secured various things which any one could count, but\r\nabove all it had instilled into the Indian nature a love of freedom\r\nand a self-assertion against authority that Indians used to lack, but\r\nEnglish people often possess in enviable abundance.\r\n\r\nI remember quoting the common opinion that Anglo-Indians have lost\r\nsympathy with Indians because they no longer make India their home,\r\nbut keep one eye on England and are always on the flit. But Mr.\r\nGokhale disagreed. He thought it an advantage that fewer English\r\npeople now settled in the country. The fairly permanent residents,\r\nlike shopkeepers and planters, were as a rule the worst mannered\r\nand most domineering, and they took hardly any part in public life.\r\nThe standard of manners in general, he thought, had gone down. It\r\nmight be that, in old days, the Englishman found it easier to be\r\nsympathetic with natives whom he could treat as dear good things. But\r\neducated Indians had come to detest such sympathy as only fit for pet\r\nanimals, and both races were beginning to notice the change. For his\r\npart, he thought that since Lord Ripon left India in 1884, the type\r\nof Englishman that came out had slowly been declining.\r\n\r\n  “It is unfortunate,” he said, “that our Congress movement should\r\n  have coincided with the past twenty-two years of violent reaction\r\n  and Imperialism in England. You can hardly imagine how intolerable\r\n  our life became at the time of the Boer war. The insolence of\r\n  Anglo-Indian papers, like the _Englishman_ or the _Civil and\r\n  Military Gazette_ towards our people goes beyond all bounds. Yet\r\n  the _Civil and Military Gazette_, which is the worst offender, has\r\n  only received a mild remonstrance from the Lieut.-Governor of the\r\n  Punjab, while the editors of Indian papers are in gaol.[9] Such\r\n  treatment, however, is the inevitable penalty of a conquered race,\r\n  and, I think, within the last year manners have mended a little.\r\n  Lord Minto, at all events, is very much the gentleman himself.\r\n\r\n  “During the last three years of Lord Curzon’s time,” he continued,\r\n  “we were kept in a state of perpetual irritation. Then came our\r\n  high hopes from the Liberal Party, and our violent disappointment.\r\n  The worst of all is that many people are beginning to lose faith\r\n  in English integrity and sense of justice—the two main qualities\r\n  that could be used for the maintenance of your power. It is a new\r\n  thing, but our young men are beginning to ask what is the good\r\n  of constitutional agitation if it only results in insult and the\r\n  Partition of Bengal? That is how Extremists are created. There are\r\n  two schools of them now, one here in Poona, the other in Bengal\r\n  itself, and Anglo-Indians are always calling upon us to denounce\r\n  them. But we are not likely to denounce a section of our own people\r\n  in face of the bureaucracy. For, after all, they have in view the\r\n  same great object as ourselves.”\r\n\r\nFor himself, I discovered many months afterwards that Mr. Gokhale\r\nhated the name of Moderate, as, I suppose, all beings of flesh and\r\nblood needs must. But, for brief, one has to call by some such name\r\nthe party which continues in patience and hope to believe that\r\nappeals to justice and reason may still induce the English people to\r\ngrant reform.\r\n\r\nFor the Simla scheme, recently put out by Mr. Morley for\r\ncriticism,[10] no Indian whom I met had anything to say, except Mr.\r\nGokhale alone, who thought he detected one or two minor points that\r\nmight possibly be of advantage. He condemned the Imperial Advisory\r\nCouncil entirely, as sure to produce a body of half-educated ruling\r\nchiefs and territorial magnates, powerless to stand against any\r\nGovernment proposal, and unlikely to be summoned except to discuss\r\na royal visit, a statue, a famine, or the plague. But from the\r\nProvincial Advisory Councils he thought something might possibly be\r\ngained, if at least half the members were elected on a high franchise\r\nand were bound to meet for the discussion of definite local subjects\r\nso many times a year.\r\n\r\nThe attempt to clutch at any possible chance of good was\r\ncharacteristic of the man. With all his power he repels the\r\ntemptation to sulky aloofness, always a strong temptation to\r\nenthusiasts in opposition. It is true he could find nothing to say\r\nfor the Simla proposal of enlarging the Viceroy’s Legislative Council\r\nfrom twenty-four to fifty-three, by packing it with representatives\r\nof Chambers of Commerce, Mohammedans, and landowners. Such a scheme\r\nwas too obviously only an attempt to crush down the influence of the\r\neducation which has been one of England’s greatest gifts to India. It\r\nwas a reversal of all British policy, which had hitherto set itself\r\nto depress the landlord gentry and men of wealth who “have a stake in\r\nthe country,” and to stand as protector of the poor. The whole thing\r\nwas too evidently framed in the spirit of fear and not of progress.\r\nBut nevertheless, in Mr. Gokhale’s own scheme of reforms, an\r\nenlargement of the Legislative Councils is a prominent clause. That\r\nand some genuine control over the Budget by representative Indians on\r\nthe Viceroy’s Council would start the reform of political machinery.\r\nIn other departments the old cry for complete separation of judicial\r\nand executive functions must be listened to, so that even the lower\r\nofficials in districts should never act both as prosecutor and judge.\r\nIn the same public services, Indians should be granted an improved\r\nposition in accordance with Queen Victoria’s Proclamation,[11] and,\r\nabove all, the teaching of children should be gradually extended till\r\nit became free and compulsory, even in villages. There were a few\r\nother points in Mr. Gokhale’s programme of immediate reform. But in\r\nnone could I discover a trace of that vagueness and impracticable\r\ndemand, that “crying for the moon,” of which Mr. Morley and other\r\ncritics of Indian demands were then complaining.[12]\r\n\r\nI met Mr. Gokhale many times again—in Poona itself, Surat, Bombay,\r\nand London—and his reasonable and open-hearted personality will often\r\nre-appear in this record. But to myself I still picture him on that\r\nDiwali evening in the refectory where the Servants of India were\r\ngathered round him, together with friends from both the main Parties\r\nof the time. In concession to my outlandish habits, I was allowed\r\na table, chair, and spoon at dinner. But the sons of the country\r\nsat on boards level with the floor, their backs against the walls,\r\nand in front of each of us was laid half a plantain or banana leaf,\r\nneatly studded round the edge with little piles of rice, beans and\r\nother seeds, flavours, sauces and other condiments, together with\r\nthin wheaten cakes. Which when we had eaten, and drunk clean water\r\nfrom round brazen vessels such as all Indians carry when they walk,\r\nwe washed up by burning the plantain leaves, rinsed our hands, and\r\ncontinued the discussion over pomegranate seeds, orange cloves, and\r\npan-leaves concealing beetel-nut and various spice. Serene, modest,\r\ndefinite in aim and in knowledge, he continued to discourse with us,\r\nuntil the full moon rolled westward, and under her obscure silence\r\nI returned to the city of the plague, where the oil lamps were now\r\nextinguished, and the children asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[8] See Introduction, p. 25.\r\n\r\n[9] See Introduction, p. 17.\r\n\r\n[10] Introduction, p. 22.\r\n\r\n[11] Introduction, p. 6.\r\n\r\n[12] Introduction, p. 28.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nRATS AND MEN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bubonic plague, as I said, had been known in India for only\r\neleven years, but from the first the common people had noticed its\r\nconnection with rats. The sight of a dead rat in a house spread\r\nterror, and when rats crept out upon the floors, regardless of man,\r\nand lay panting to death, it was early recognized that the plague was\r\nat hand. The unlearned observed these warnings, but no one detected\r\ntheir full significance, and for many years the pestilence was\r\nattributed to bad water or overcrowded and insanitary houses.\r\n\r\nIn Poona it was thought there was too much water about, and the\r\nofficer of health undertook the remedial measure of draining a rather\r\nnice pond that used to be behind the Deccan Club, and converting it\r\ninto as malarial a marsh as I have ever seen outside West Africa.\r\nThe authorities, in their perplexity, also set about cleansing the\r\nquarters and homes of the Indian population, who, I suppose, are, on\r\nthe whole, the most scrupulous about washing and cleaning of any\r\nworking people in the world. They tried disinfectants, and poured\r\nthousands of pounds in the form of chemicals down drains, ditches,\r\nand streets. Sometimes, by mistake, they poured things that do not\r\ndisinfect, and still the plague went on. They tried “segregation.”\r\nThey divided the city into compartments under military guard, and\r\nsent British soldiers into the homes to examine men, women, and\r\nchildren, and take them off to isolated hospitals if there was a\r\nsign of plague. The symptom from which the plague takes its name of\r\n“bubonic” is the swelling of the great glands in the groin into hard\r\nlumps. No greater profanation of the Indian reverence for home and\r\nwomen could be imagined than this forcible entrance and examination\r\nby men—by soldiers of another race. No matter how kindly and decent\r\nand respectful our men were, no virtue on their part could prevent\r\ntheir presence and action from infuriating any population, especially\r\nin an Asiatic town. Riots broke out, and when I was in Poona, a small\r\nstone was put up to mark the spot on the country road to Government\r\nHouse, where the Chairman of the Plague Committee had been murdered,\r\ntogether with a young officer who happened to be with him. When the\r\nyouth who conceived the deed was sentenced, he said to the judge,\r\n“You may hang me to-morrow, but my soul will at once pass into\r\nanother body, and in sixteen years it will be fighting against the\r\nEnglish again.”\r\n\r\nThe kindly zeal, the strenuous measures, the fatherly concern, the\r\nhaste to do something, the utter inability to understand another\r\npoint of view, are alike characteristic of our Government and of the\r\nelephant that sat on the orphaned eggs to hatch them.\r\n\r\nFrom that time, I believe, arose a peculiar bitterness and feeling\r\nof distrust towards our rule that slowly permeated the country, and\r\nare still particularly strong in Poona itself. But their origin is\r\ndistant now, and when I was there all our old methods had long been\r\nabandoned. There was now no examination for suspected cases, and no\r\nmilitary searching of houses. The people were not “segregated,” and\r\ngeneral disinfection was given up. Inoculation and “health camps”\r\nhad become the Government methods now. The object of inoculation\r\nwas the same as similar processes in other diseases, like small-pox\r\nor typhoid; the object of the “health camps” was simply to separate\r\nhuman beings from rats.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A HEALTH CAMP.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN A VILLAGE.\r\n\r\n  [_Face p. 50._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThat old connection between rats and plague had lately been examined\r\nafresh, chiefly by Dr. Turner, the Public Health Officer in Bombay,\r\nand the theory of the rat-flea had sprung into science. Contemplate\r\na dead rat lying on your floor in the day-time, and you will find\r\nnumerous fleas leaping up and down upon his body. If you are wise\r\nand prudent, you will rapidly pour kerosene over him from a distance,\r\nand then set him alight. For if, having seen him brewing in the air,\r\nyou do not thus nip him in the bud, you are likely to fall a victim\r\nto the plague after sunset. A rat’s fleas are not the harmless,\r\nhomely insects that we know. This species of flea has a special\r\npredilection for rats, and they will not leave their favourite home\r\nif they can help it, at all events by day. At night, when the rat is\r\ndead, they have to go, and then, as a last resort, they will take\r\nrefuge on a human body for want of better sustenance. But with them\r\nthey bring the germ that has killed the rat.\r\n\r\nWhether they themselves infect the rat in the first instance, or\r\nwhether they only transmit from him a bacillus which the rat has\r\ndeveloped from other origins, I have not discovered; but I suppose\r\nthe latter. Nor am I quite sure whether the fleas die of plague\r\nthemselves or remain immune. Anyhow, the theory is that when once\r\nthey have passed the germ into a human being’s blood, the plague\r\nis assured. In a climate like India’s the most careful and cleanly\r\npeople can never be secure against fleas, for, wash as they will,\r\nsome insect or other is pretty certain to be biting them every minute\r\nof the day and night, and it is difficult to distinguish one bite\r\nfrom another. A further terror is that the little grey squirrel\r\nwith paler stripes, which draws no distinction of race or riches,\r\nand swarms throughout India, even on the roofs of the wealthiest\r\nbungalows, is quite as much a favourite with the fleas as any rat\r\ncould be. While I was in Poona they were climbing over my verandah\r\nand scampering across my floor by dozens, and I took a peculiarly\r\npersonal interest in their health, which happily appeared excellent.\r\n\r\nThe British Government was, at the time, buying rats alive at some\r\nfraction of a farthing a head. They had already purchased 25,000 in\r\nthe town when I was there, and everywhere one met industrious Hindus\r\ncarrying rats in cages to the official rat-collector. Whether the\r\nprice was high enough to induce industrious Hindus to breed rats for\r\nthe British market, I do not know. But I believe it was found that\r\nthe reduction of the rat population gave the survivors such increased\r\nvitality that never had such active and powerful specimens of rat\r\nbeen seen before.\r\n\r\nThere is no very strict rule about the season for plague. Sometimes\r\nit comes in the rains, sometimes in the drought. Usually it is worst\r\nat the end of winter, but in 1907, when nearly 70,000 people died in\r\na week in the Punjab, it was approaching the height of summer. As a\r\nrule the season lasts three months, and in bad seasons at Poona the\r\ncases go up to 100 a day. While I was there, the rate, as I said\r\nabove, was comparatively low—only 12, 15, or 20 cases a day. But in\r\nthe Presidency of Bombay, as a whole, people were dying by 7000 a\r\nweek, and that seems a good deal, even though the population of the\r\nprovinces is 18,000,000, including Scinde. The British Isles count\r\nfor more than twice that number, but if we began dying of plague by\r\n7000 a week, I dare say there would arise such a commotion for escape\r\nas when you stir up an ants’ nest with a stick.\r\n\r\nIn Poona the Government had erected rows of tin huts as a hospital on\r\nsome vacant ground just beyond the railway station, and there I was\r\nable to observe cases of the pestilence in every stage. There were\r\nfrom 80 to 100 men, women, and children admitted as patients, and\r\nthe men and women were laid in separate rows. But otherwise not much\r\ndifference could be made between the patients as to caste and habits,\r\nthough some of the Brahmans had their food sent in from outside when\r\nthey were recovering, like first-class misdemeanants in our prisons.\r\nIt is rather peculiar that the Brahmans offer least resistance\r\nto the disease, and this the Sister-in-charge attributed to the\r\nstrictness of their vegetarianism for ages past. To Europeans it is\r\nless fatal than to any Indians, but, next to Europeans, the lowest or\r\n“sweeper” caste, who will eat anything anyhow, almost like Europeans\r\nthemselves, are the best patients, and show the most recoveries.\r\nThere may, however, be other reasons for this difference besides\r\nthe food—I mean the natural hardiness of the labouring class, and\r\nthe natural tendency of all highly organized and sensitive beings to\r\ncollapse under fever.\r\n\r\nEach patient in hospital lay in a separate cubicle, and mothers\r\nor other relations were allowed to visit and sit there. A\r\nplague-stricken mother might, I believe, even bring a young child\r\nwith her, so great was the confidence in the new theory of infection\r\nand in the absence of rats. The stories of instant and unavoidable\r\ncontagion in other plagues, such as the plague of London, seem to\r\nseparate those diseases in kind from this bubonic plague; but very\r\nlikely the stories were not true, or what was considered to be\r\ncontagion was in reality an underlying common origin.\r\n\r\nIt was some comfort to a mother to be allowed to watch her thin,\r\nbright-eyed child panting its life away, but the absorbed intensity\r\nof her watching, as a rule, had not to continue long. The disease\r\nbegins with violent headache and a rapidly increasing temperature;\r\nthe breath becomes terrible, and the tongue chalky white or bluish.\r\nThere is a strong objection to taking food or drink, and milk is\r\noften spat out by a spasm in the throat, as in hydrophobia. Delirium\r\nsupervenes about the third day and usually lasts to the sixth, when\r\nmost patients die. During the delirium there is an extreme desire to\r\nget up and walk about, so that many patients have to be strapped down\r\nto their beds. Far the most important thing is to keep the patient\r\nabsolutely still, as death most frequently comes from collapse of\r\nthe heart, and recovery depends almost entirely upon the patient’s\r\nconstitutional power of heart action. An English lady, who had come\r\nthrough the disease, told me that even during the delirium she seemed\r\nto be dimly conscious of the strain on the heart; but this memory may\r\nhave been only suggestion. I think the delirious patients that I saw\r\nwould be incapable of remembering anything of those three days, even\r\nif they recovered.\r\n\r\nMeantime, in their benign efforts to work off the poison in the\r\nblood, the glands have from a very early stage developed into hard\r\nlumps that usually suppurate and have to be incised, but sometimes\r\nabsorb without operation. When I touched the glands in the groin,\r\nthey felt like walnuts under the skin, and it is, as I said,\r\nthe presence of this obvious symptom which gives the plague its\r\ncharacteristic name of “bubonic,” from the Greek word for groin.\r\nAfter incision, the patient’s temperature often goes down rapidly,\r\nbut, in any case, the pain from the glands is usually very great;\r\nindeed, I think it is the chief cause of such pain as the plague\r\ngives.\r\n\r\nNext to heart failure, the commonest cause of death is lung\r\ncomplication after the crisis of fever is passed. The prostration\r\nwhen the temperature begins to decline is usually extreme, and\r\nsome patients whom I saw were so emaciated that they appeared to be\r\nparodies of famine—legs and arms like sticks, back and ribs like\r\nframeworks of bone. It is true that probably they were not very fat\r\nwhen they went into hospital. The delirium often leaves the patients\r\nsilly, and if I had been in Central Africa again, I should have said\r\nat once that several of them had sleeping sickness in the third or\r\nfourth month—the time when, in sleeping sickness, the control over\r\nthe emotions begins to fail. The nurses in the hospital were Indian\r\nwomen, under the direction of a European Sister.[13]\r\n\r\nWhile I was still in Poona, Sir George Clarke, the new Governor of\r\nBombay, who was already winning the confidence and respect of Indians\r\nin all parties by his straightforward ways and his freedom from\r\nofficial routine, issued a proclamation giving the actual statistics\r\nof the plague, and calling on the people to submit themselves\r\nvoluntarily to inoculation as the only means of defence yet\r\ndiscovered. The proclamation was read about the streets in Mahrati,\r\nthe people listening patiently, and then reflecting. Many Indians\r\nhave a feeling against inoculation, just as thousands of English\r\npeople have. They regard it as some sort of contamination, even when\r\nit is voluntary, and the memory of an old error in the serum that\r\npoisoned a village dies hard.[14] There is also a certain amount of\r\nnational and even religious prejudice on the subject. The thing is\r\nEuropean; it does not fit in with Hindu tradition, and Mr. Tilak, the\r\nmost powerful political and religious force in Poona, was known at\r\nthat time to oppose it. Still, it had been proved that, as a rule, no\r\ngreat harm was done, and, on the off-chance that it might save their\r\nlives, many took it. For inoculation there was the further inducement\r\nof sixpence bestowed on each patient by a considerate Government, so\r\nas to tide over the two or three days’ gentle illness that usually\r\nfollows the operation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A VILLAGE STREET.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A STREET IN PLAGUE.\r\n\r\n  [_Face p. 58._\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt naturally occurs to one that many a poor but dishonest man would\r\ngladly be inoculated every day of his life for sixpence, or would,\r\nat all events, induce his wife and children thus to contribute to\r\nthe family budget. Very likely that happens from time to time in the\r\ncase of far-seeing people who are resolved to avail themselves fully\r\nof the Government’s prophylactic measures. But some real check upon\r\nthis form of prudence is imposed by the appearance of the arm, and an\r\nofficial check is also kept by an elaborate system of finger-print\r\nrecords—one of the most official farces I have ever seen. Even more\r\nembarrassing, however, than the thrifty man is he who, feeling rather\r\nunwell, hastens up to be inoculated, and is found to be developing\r\nthe plague already. Of course, nothing will persuade him that his\r\nvisit to the inoculator was not the cause of the disease, and much\r\nsuspicion is spread in this way among the people. It is, in any\r\ncase, extremely difficult to induce women to take the inoculation.\r\nEverything possible is done to shelter their feelings; a most\r\ndiscreet curtain is hung to protect them from sight and make them\r\nfeel at home; one of their own people is the operator, and only an\r\ninch or two of arm is exposed, whereas they never have the slightest\r\nobjection to walking in the crowd with legs and waist quite bare at\r\nany hour of the day. Yet the whole traditional instinct of Indian\r\nwomanhood, from the day of Sita, Rama’s wife, rises up in protest\r\nagainst such a profanation.\r\n\r\nAt four separate points of the native city the Government had set\r\nup stations where all comers might be inoculated free—not only\r\nfree, but with that sixpenny reward. In the midst of the central\r\nmarket-place, where elderly bangle-merchants, with the help of soapy\r\npowder, were squeezing gorgeous glass bangles from China over women’s\r\nhands, and men and women were squatted on the stones, chaffering\r\nover little heaps of queer vegetables and fruit, I found a native\r\napostle of science and fatherly Government preaching the terrors of\r\nplague and the glory of redemption by serum. Before him was fixed\r\na little spirit stove, on which boiling vaseline simmered. At his\r\nside was a glass saucer containing scraps of cotton wool dipped in\r\nstrong carbolic. One hand gesticulated the truths of nature, the\r\nother held a little glass syringe, with a long, sharp beak, and any\r\none could see that the syringe was half full of yellow salvation.\r\nUnder the mingled influences of rhetoric and fear of death, a man\r\nstepped forward from the listening half-circle. With the carbolic\r\nwool the expositor washed the dust from the thin brown arm, told the\r\npatient to admire an imaginary bird in the opposite direction, just\r\nlike a Margate photographer with a child, and plunged the sharp-nosed\r\nsyringe first into the boiling vaseline and then under the brown\r\nskin. Instantly it was withdrawn, but a drop or two of the yellow\r\nsalvation had gone, and for three or four months—say, for the length\r\nof one plague season, but only for that—the man was fairly safe. The\r\ncrowd sighed its satisfaction, as when a rocket bursts. The place on\r\nthe arm was wiped with carbolic wool. “Take his thumb mark, give him\r\nthe paper of instructions, pay him his six annas,” said the apostle\r\nof bacillary science in Mahrati to a subordinate, and the labour of a\r\nfatherly Government struggling with adversity went doggedly on.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[13] For the sake of comparison it may be of interest to quote a few\r\nof the symptoms given in descriptions of other plagues. The account\r\nby Thucydides (ii. 49) of the plague in Athens, 430 B.C., is the\r\nmost detailed: “All of a sudden,” he says, “people who were quite\r\nwell before were seized with violent pains in the head, together\r\nwith redness and inflammation of the eyes; the throat and tongue\r\nbecame blood-red, and the breath strangely disagreeable. Sneezing and\r\nsore throat ensued, and after a short time the lungs were affected\r\nand there was violent coughing. When the disease settled in the\r\nstomach it caused great disorder, with every known kind of purging\r\nof bile, accompanied by severe pain. Most patients suffered from an\r\nempty retching, with violent spasms, that sometimes gave relief at\r\nonce, sometimes only after a long time. The surface of the body was\r\nnot very hot to touch, nor was it pale, but suffused red or livid,\r\ncovered with small spots and ulcers. But the internal heat was so\r\ngreat that the patients could not endure even the lightest clothes or\r\nmuslins, but insisted on being naked, and longed to throw themselves\r\ninto cold water. Many who were not looked after actually jumped into\r\nwells, overcome with unquenchable thirst; but it was just the same\r\nwhether a patient drank much or little. All through the illness they\r\nwere unable to keep still or get any sleep. Whilst the fever was at\r\nits height the body did not waste away, but resisted the disease\r\nbeyond all expectation, so that most patients died from the internal\r\nfever on the seventh or ninth day with a good deal of strength still\r\nleft; or, if they survived the crisis, the disease descended to the\r\nbowels, where it set up ulceration and such violent diarrhœa that in\r\nmost cases death ensued from weakness.”\r\n\r\nThe chief symptoms given by Boccaccio in the Introduction to the\r\n“Decameron,” where he describes the plague in Florence (1348),\r\nare: “At the beginning of the disease both men and women developed\r\nswellings in the groin or under the armpit. These swellings grew to\r\nthe size of a crab-apple or an egg, sometimes larger, sometimes less,\r\nand the common people called them ‘gavoccioli.’ In a short time this\r\ndeadly sore began to spread to all parts of the body, and the nature\r\nof the disease gradually changed into black or livid spots, which\r\nappeared on the arms and thighs and other parts, sometimes large and\r\nscattered, sometimes minute and thick together.” He goes on to speak\r\nof the entire inability of doctors to deal with the plague, and of\r\nthe readiness with which the smallest association or contagion spread\r\nit from one to another.\r\n\r\nDefoe wrote only at secondhand about the plague of London (1665),\r\nbut such symptoms as he gives of that “spotted fever” were probably\r\ntaken from eye-witnesses with whom he had conversed. He mentions\r\nviolent pains in the head, vomitings, and spots on the thighs; also\r\n“swellings, generally in the neck and groin, which, when they grew\r\nhard and would not break, grew so painful that it was equal to the\r\nmost exquisite torture.... In some these swellings were made hard,\r\npartly by the force of the distemper, and partly by their being too\r\nviolently drawn, and were so hard that no instrument could cut them,\r\nand then they burnt them with caustics, so that many died raving mad\r\nin the torment, and some in the very operation. In these distresses,\r\nsome for want of help to hold them down in their beds, or to look to\r\nthem, laid hands upon themselves. Some broke out into the streets,\r\nperhaps naked, and would run directly down to the river, if they were\r\nnot stopped by the watchman or other officer, and plunge themselves\r\ninto the water, wherever they found it.”\r\n\r\n[14] In 1902, nineteen died from this cause at Mulkowal, a village\r\nin the Punjab, and the Punjab Government abandoned the hope of\r\ninoculation for the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE EXTREMIST\r\n\r\n\r\nI knew it would come. Till I had been some time in Bombay, I did not\r\nrealize the custom, but the moment I realized it, I felt there was no\r\nescape. As often happens with forebodings, it came unexpectedly in\r\nthe end. I was visiting the simple house, workshop, and garden, in a\r\nmain street of Poona, where the two Extremist papers are published.\r\nBoth appear weekly—the _Mahratta_ in English, the _Kesari_ or\r\n_Lion_ in the Mahrati language. Both are owned and directed by Mr.\r\nTilak, the acknowledged leader of the Extremists in India, but the\r\n_Mahratta_ was edited by Mr. Kelkar, an intellectual, keen-tempered\r\nBrahman, who accompanied me over the printing office and showed me a\r\ncourteous friendliness all through my stay in Poona. Both papers have\r\nobtained what is thought a large circulation in India—the _Mahratta_\r\nselling 11,000 a week, the _Kesari_ close upon twice that number. In\r\noutward appearance, the _Mahratta_ is very much like the _Spectator_.\r\nThe _Kesari_, with lions in emblem defiant on each side of the tide,\r\nis on cheaper paper of eight folded pages. Its language is said to\r\nbe more violent than the _Mahratta’s_, which as a rule is carefully\r\nmoderate in expression.\r\n\r\nIn the cool and quiet of the editor’s room, among bookshelves\r\nmildewing like most Indian libraries, I was listening to the history\r\nof the papers when I observed a crowd of brown printers, deferential\r\nbut eager, at the door. In their hands they bore strange objects,\r\nsuch as I had never before seen, but at a glance I knew the moment\r\nhad arrived. Advancing to my chair they hung around my neck a thick\r\nfestoon of orange marigolds, picked out with the silvery tinsel\r\nwhich decorators of our Christmas trees identify with fairy rain.\r\nThey encircled both my wrists with orange bracelets to match, and\r\nin my right hand they placed an arrangement of variegated flowers\r\nand spangles, stiff and formal as the sceptre of the Tsar. So I\r\nsat enthroned, and if only a correspondent from Calcutta had been\r\npresent, the broadsheets of London that evening might have screamed\r\nwith scare-heads of “Sedition!” Even in the midst of my friendly\r\nembarrassment, I could not but regret a journalistic opportunity lost.\r\n\r\nEmbarrassing, certainly it was, but only to my British ignorance\r\nand shyness. To complete the Imperial ceremony, my dusky subjects\r\nsprinkled me with delicate odours from silvern vessels; they soused\r\nmy handkerchief in scent; they rubbed spikenard and aloes on the back\r\nof my hands. Then, standing at a distance, they contemplated their\r\nhandiwork with kindly satisfaction, while I laboured to express my\r\naugust gratification in an Imperial tongue they could not understand.\r\nEvery one present knew, and I knew myself, that they would have\r\nhonoured in the same way any visitor who had come to their works in\r\na benignant spirit. Even when, hung with fillets like a sacrificial\r\nvictim and bearing the floral sceptre upright in my hand, I issued\r\nfrom the front door into the full blaze of the public street, the\r\npassers-by looked at me with admiring interest, but without a trace\r\nof laughter. These things are merely habit, and before I left India I\r\nlived to dread garlands as little as my bed. But that first time—with\r\nwhat shamefaced horror the consciousness of my British trousers\r\nand khaki helmet filled me! Suddenly, with an inexplicable pang, I\r\nremembered that I had once rowed two in the Christ Church torpid, and\r\nif any of my own countrymen had gone down the street at that moment,\r\nI think I should have got under my cart instead of into it.[15]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MR. TILAK.\r\n\r\n  [_Face p. 64._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThus ornamented by a graceful hospitality, I drove away, some sixteen\r\nmiles south-west of the city, through an irrigated and fertile\r\nland of terraced rice-fields, draining the abundant water that rice\r\nflourishes in from one level into another. Slowly we drew near a\r\ngreat blue mountain, conspicuous from Poona among the other hills\r\nfor its height and flat-topped outline. It is the mountain fortress\r\nof Singarh, famed in Deccan history. Unknown peoples had made it\r\ntheir rock of defence, Mohammedans had reigned there, Mahrattas took\r\nit by storm. Finally the British, some ninety years ago, bombarded\r\nthe place till it could stand no more, and now all that afternoon\r\nI had watched a British helio on its summit blinking messages to\r\nthe Poona cantonment. There is a long, steep climb before the old\r\nfortifications that run round the edge of the cliffs are reached,\r\nfor the top is as high as Ben Nevis. But passing through a western\r\narch in the walls we entered on the broad grassy plateau while still\r\nthe low horizon was brilliant with sunset, and against the sunset a\r\nred-turbaned, white-clad figure, upright but using a long staff, came\r\nto meet me.\r\n\r\nBal Gangadhar Tilak appeared to be about ten years older than Mr.\r\nGokhale, but it is difficult to tell his age, for if ever he takes\r\noff his Mahratta turban, one sees his head shaven to the back, where\r\nthe hair grows in a long, black tuft, as is the fashion of his race\r\nor caste. His full, brown eyes are singularly brilliant, steady with\r\ndaring, rather aggressive But his general manner is very quiet and\r\ncontrolled, and both in conversation and public speaking he talks\r\nin brief, assured sentences, quite free from rhetoric, outwardly\r\npassionless even in moments of the highest passion, and seldom going\r\nbeyond the statement of facts, or, rather, of his aspect of facts at\r\nthe time. His apparent calmness and self-command may arise partly\r\nfrom courageous indifference to his own future, partly from prolonged\r\nlegal practice at his own trials. At first one would say, his was\r\nthe legal mind, subtle, given to fine distinctions, rather capable\r\nof expressing thought than of thinking, and quick to adapt both the\r\nexpression and the thought to the audience of the moment. But there\r\nis much in his life and energies that seems to show that his natural\r\nbias was towards religious speculation and scholarly traditions.\r\n\r\nAmong the leading reformers of India, he is probably the most\r\northodox Hindu. He professes a devout belief in progressive Hinduism\r\nand in successive reincarnations of Krishna at epochs of India’s\r\ngreatest need. But in practice his Hinduism often reacts against\r\nthe forces of progress, and serves him as an ally in resisting the\r\nmaterializing notions imported from the West. In scholarship, he is\r\nknown among all Sanscrit scholars as one of the closest and most\r\noriginal. His book on “The Arctic Home of the Vedas” maintains from\r\ninternal evidence that the Sacred Books of India originated among a\r\nglacial people inhabiting the region of the Arctic Circle, or some\r\nland equally chilly. I cannot say what the value of the theory may\r\nbe. Possibly the book is as fantastic as it is learned. But to me\r\nit is significant because it appeared in the midst of the author’s\r\ndirest persecution, when money, reputation, influence, and everything\r\nwere at stake, and few men would have had the courage to spare a\r\nthought either for Sacred Books or Arctic Circles.\r\n\r\nIt is said that he is embittered. One of the highest and best of\r\nEnglish officials in India told me he admired Mr. Tilak, and would\r\ngladly know him personally, but was afraid of inviting him for fear\r\nof a rebuff, so irreconcilable was the man reputed. Yet when the\r\nmeeting did take place, by a kind of accident some weeks later,\r\nthere was no rebuff, but only courtesy and openly expressed esteem.\r\nCertainly, if a fine nature can ever be embittered, Mr. Tilak has\r\nhad enough to embitter him. Early in the ’eighties he was imprisoned\r\nfor speaking against the Diwan or Prime Minister of a Native State,\r\nwhom he accused of cruelty to the Raja. In September, 1897, he\r\nwas sentenced to eighteen months’ imprisonment for attacks in the\r\n_Kesari_ upon the Bombay Government when the population of Poona\r\nwas frenzied at the plague regulations. After a year in gaol he was\r\nreleased, but soon afterwards he became involved in a private suit\r\nconcerned with his trusteeship for a widow named Tai Maharaj and her\r\nadoption of an heir. The Bombay Government took up the case, and the\r\ntrial, with appeals, dragged on for nearly two years, Mr. Tilak being\r\ncondemned by one magistrate to a long imprisonment and heavy fine.\r\n“The paths of scholarship,” was the _Pioneer’s_ comment, “lead but to\r\nthe gaol,” and in Court Mr. Tilak was publicly handcuffed. Finally,\r\nin March, 1904, his appeal came before the High Court of Bombay,\r\nrepresented by Chief Justice Sir Lawrence Jenkins and Mr. Justice\r\nBatty; the conviction and sentence were quashed and the fine was\r\nordered to be refunded.\r\n\r\nThis judgment confirmed the common Indian opinion that British\r\njustice can best be looked for in the High Courts of Bombay,\r\nCalcutta, and Madras, because the judges appointed directly by the\r\nCrown can maintain the law without being unconsciously prejudiced\r\nby long service under the Anglo-Indian routine. But, unfortunately,\r\nowing to Mr. Tilak’s past record, and his connection with the\r\nExtremist papers, the ruinous action taken against him had the air\r\nof persecution, and laid the Bombay Government open to a charge\r\nof vindictiveness. It was during these proceedings that Mr. Tilak\r\ndisplayed his fine unconcern by issuing his treatise on the origin\r\nof the Vedas, and in the end, when his innocence was finally\r\nestablished, he found that a leader’s greatest advantage of having\r\nsuffered for his cause was indefinitely increased.\r\n\r\nWhen I met him that evening on the mountain top, another crisis\r\nof his fate was just being decided, but nothing could surpass his\r\noutward calm. He was living in one of the dilapidated bungalows\r\nthinly scattered over the plateau. I was put to lodge in another\r\nempty one, because, belonging, as he does, to the same high caste\r\nas Mr. Gokhale, and to the same subsection of it, he refuses, as a\r\nstrict Hindu, to emancipate himself from the caste obligations and\r\nlive or eat with mere Europeans. All that night the wind roared\r\nover the mountains, but with the first sun he came to lead me round\r\nthe elaborate ruins of the fortifications, and, as though he had no\r\ninterest in the world except as tourist’s guide, he showed me where\r\nthe British guns had battered, and where, in the time of the Mahratta\r\nhero, Shivaji, two hundred and forty years ago, his own ancestors\r\ncrept up the precipice at night and scaled this very wall, aided by\r\na great lizard that was trained to carry a string up the surface and\r\nhold tight with its claws till a man could climb. So at this dizzy\r\nspot the party had climbed; then killed.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to perceive the marvels of the past, and belief in them is\r\nunimportant. But to realize the strange significance of the man at\r\nmy side, and to understand the things he believed in at the moment\r\nwas a different matter. He continued to discourse about the villages\r\nhalf hidden in the deep valleys below, and narrate their sufferings,\r\nhopes, and varying prosperity as if he had no further thought on\r\nearth beyond their cattle and their rice. But I knew that at Nagpur\r\nin the Central Provinces, things had just been happening which deeply\r\ninvolved himself and his party. The annual meeting of the National\r\nCongress was to have been held there at Christmas. The Reception\r\nCommittee had met to appoint a President, and the Moderates of the\r\nmajority chose Dr. Rash Behari Ghose. Thereupon, the Extremists,\r\ninsisting upon their majority in the Central Provinces and in the\r\nExecutive Committee, chose Mr. Tilak. He in turn proposed Mr. Lajpat\r\nRai, as a compromise; but, with his usual chivalry, Mr. Lajpat Rai\r\nrefused to stand rather than risk a division among the reform party,\r\nor an open breach between the Congress and the Government. To be\r\nsure, deeper questions of principle or of method lay behind these\r\npersonal disputes, but on the personal question of the President the\r\nNagpur meeting had just broken up in disorder. The Moderates had\r\ndetermined not to hold the Congress at Nagpur at all, but to accept\r\nthe invitation of Surat, only a few hours’ journey north of Bombay,\r\nwhich was the headquarters of the strongest section among them.\r\n\r\nCompared to the wild adventures of his Mahratta ancestry, or to\r\nthe economic conditions of the peasants far below us, one might\r\nhave supposed from his manner that Mr. Tilak regarded these party\r\ndifferences as beneath all notice. Perhaps he did so regard them,\r\nand, if he did, he was partially right. But still, at the moment, the\r\nparty difference was the thing attracting most attention in India,\r\nand it was sure to grow in importance. Mr. Tilak’s own thoughts might\r\nhave been occupied with the situation all day, but it was only in\r\nthe afternoon that he came quietly into my empty bungalow alone, and\r\nbegan to discuss it in his concise and definite way. When I published\r\na careful abstract of this conversation shortly afterwards, many\r\nModerates and Extremists alike supposed that he had dissembled his\r\ntrue intentions, and told me only what he wished to be known. As he\r\ndid not ask for secrecy, certainly I never supposed he was telling\r\nme things he did not wish to be known, and I think it very likely\r\nthat he enjoyed giving himself the pleasure of appearing as Moderate\r\nas possible. But in the evening I read over to him the notes I had\r\ntaken of the conversation just as it was afterwards published, and he\r\napproved of what I wrote. In studying his speeches and writings of\r\nrecent years, I have also found the lines of his policy laid down in\r\nalmost the same words as he used to me, and I am inclined to think\r\nthat his statements resembled his beliefs rather closely.\r\n\r\nHis first object was to show that, as to their immediate purpose,\r\nExtremists and Moderates did not differ in aim:—\r\n\r\n  “It is not by our purpose, but by our methods only,” he said, “that\r\n  our party has earned the name of Extremist. Certainly, there is\r\n  a very small party which talks about abolishing the British rule\r\n  at once and completely. That does not concern us; it is much too\r\n  far in the future. Unorganized, disarmed, and still disunited, we\r\n  should not have a chance of shaking the British suzerainty. We may\r\n  leave all that sort of thing to a distant time. Our object is to\r\n  obtain eventually a large share in the administration of our own\r\n  country. Our remote ideal is a confederacy of the Indian provinces,\r\n  possessing colonial self-government, with all Imperial questions\r\n  set apart for the central government in England. Perhaps our Home\r\n  Rule would take the form of Provincial Councils of fifty or sixty\r\n  members, nominated or indirectly elected at first, but elected by\r\n  popular vote as education became more general.\r\n\r\n  “But that ideal also,” he went on, “is far ahead of us—perhaps\r\n  generations ahead. What we aim at doing now is to bring pressure\r\n  on the bureaucracy; to make it feel that all is not well. Of late\r\n  the attitude of our British officials has greatly changed for the\r\n  worse. They no longer speak of educating us up to freedom, as the\r\n  great Englishmen like Elphinstone did in the past. They appear to\r\n  agree with the _Times_ that our education in subjects like English\r\n  history must be checked, because it is dangerous for ‘natives’ to\r\n  learn anything about freedom. Your present statesmen seem to take\r\n  the old Roman Empire as their ideal, and even in that they follow\r\n  the modern school of Oxford historians, who trace the fall of the\r\n  Empire to the concession of citizenship to the provinces.\r\n\r\n  “I know the worst that you can say about the Russian bureaucracy;\r\n  but even that bureaucracy does, according to its lights, seek to\r\n  maintain the honour and prosperity of Russia, because Russia is its\r\n  own country. Our bureaucracy administers a country not its own for\r\n  the sake of a country far away, entirely different in character and\r\n  interests. Our bureaucracy is despotic, alien, and absentee.”\r\n\r\nMr. Tilak then referred to the well-known complaints brought against\r\nour Administration by nearly all students of Indian economics—the\r\n“drain” of some £30,000,000 to £35,000,000 a year to England in the\r\nshape of various payments from an impoverished country; the ruin of\r\nIndian trades and manufactures, first by duties against her exports,\r\nand now by customs dues within her own borders, deliberately imposed\r\nfor the advantage of British, Austrian, and American firms; the\r\nreduction of very nearly the whole population to a subsistence on\r\na starving agriculture; and the unexplained increase of malaria,\r\nfamine, and plague.\r\n\r\n  “The immediate question for us,” he continued, “is how we are to\r\n  bring pressure on this bureaucracy, in which we have no effective\r\n  representation, but are debarred from all except subordinate\r\n  positions. It is only in our answer to that question that we differ\r\n  from the so-called Moderates. They still hope to influence public\r\n  opinion in England by sending deputations, supporting a newspaper,\r\n  and pleading the justice of our cause. Both parties, of course,\r\n  have long ago given up all hope of influencing Anglo-Indian opinion\r\n  out here. But even in England we find most people ignorant and\r\n  indifferent about India, and the influence of retired Anglo-Indians\r\n  at home is perpetually against us. When Lord Cromer said the other\r\n  day that India must be no party question, he meant that Liberals\r\n  should support the bureaucracy as blindly as Tories. The history of\r\n  the last year has proved to us how unexceptionably they fulfil that\r\n  duty.\r\n\r\n  “Under these disappointments we Extremists have determined on other\r\n  methods. It is a matter of temperament, and the younger men are\r\n  with us. Our motto is ‘Self-reliance, not Mendicancy.’\r\n\r\n  “Besides the ordinary Swadeshi movement, we work by boycott and\r\n  passive resistance. Our boycott is voluntary. We do not advocate\r\n  picketing or compulsory prevention from the purchase of foreign\r\n  goods. And in passive resistance we shall simply refuse to notice\r\n  such measures as the Seditious Meetings Act. But we do not care\r\n  what happens to ourselves. We are devoted absolutely and without\r\n  reservation to the cause of the Indian peoples. To imprison\r\n  even 3000 or 4000 of us at the same time would embarrass the\r\n  bureaucracy. That is our object—to attract the attention of England\r\n  to our wrongs by diverting trade and obstructing the Government.\r\n  Without in the least intending it, England has promoted the idea\r\n  of Indian unity—by railways, by education, and the use of a common\r\n  official language. The mere pressure of the British domination upon\r\n  us makes for unity. Our unity will not be complete, perhaps, for\r\n  generations yet, but it is the goal to which our faces are now set,\r\n  and we shall not turn back.”\r\n\r\nAs I said, many have suspected that, in this statement of his party’s\r\naims and methods, Mr. Tilak was playing down to an Englishman’s love\r\nof moderation. To some extent that may have been true, but only, I\r\nthink, with regard to the distance in time at which he placed India’s\r\nrealization of self-government. On January 4, 1907, Mr. Tilak had\r\naddressed the students in College Square, Calcutta, upon the “Tenets\r\nof the New Party,” and I extract a few sentences dealing with this\r\nsubject:—\r\n\r\n  “There were certain points,” he said, “on which both parties were\r\n  agreed. The object both parties had at heart was the same; it was\r\n  self-government. The present system of administration was ruinous\r\n  to the country both materially and morally.... There were some,\r\n  indeed, who still believed that the continuance of the British rule\r\n  was necessary for some centuries in order to raise them to the\r\n  level of civilized nations. Those who held such views obviously\r\n  could not follow his arguments, and they must agree to differ and\r\n  part as friends. But most of them were agreed that the present\r\n  system must be mended or ended as soon as possible. Their object\r\n  being the same, it was with regard to their methods that the\r\n  difference arose.\r\n\r\n  “... The New Party’s conclusion was that it was impossible to\r\n  gain any concessions by petitions and prayers. This was the first\r\n  difference between the Moderate and Progressive parties. He did\r\n  not believe in the philanthropy of British politics. There was\r\n  no instance in history of one foreign nation ruling another for\r\n  the benefit of the other and not for its own profit. The rule of\r\n  one nation by another was in itself unnatural. He granted the\r\n  efficiency of the British Government and the excellence of its\r\n  methods for its own purpose, but these methods and that efficiency\r\n  did not work for the interests of the people of the country. A\r\n  good foreign government was less desirable than an inferior native\r\n  government.”[16]\r\n\r\nOn the question of revolution and revolutionary violence, the\r\nfollowing passage occurred in Mr. Tilak’s address during the Shivaji\r\nFestival in Poona, June, 1907:—\r\n\r\n  “It is true that what we seek may seem like a revolution; it is\r\n  a revolution in the sense that it means a complete change in\r\n  the theory of the government of India as now put forward by the\r\n  bureaucracy. It is true that this revolution must be a bloodless\r\n  revolution, but it would be a folly to suppose that if there is to\r\n  be no shedding of blood, there are also to be no sufferings to be\r\n  undergone by the people. These sufferings must be great. You can\r\n  win nothing unless you are prepared to suffer. An appeal to the\r\n  good-feeling of the rulers is everywhere discovered to have but\r\n  narrow limits. Your revolution must be bloodless, but that does not\r\n  mean that you may not have to suffer or to go to gaol.”[17]\r\n\r\nWhen I left the mountain’s summit, Mr. Tilak accompanied me back to\r\nthe limit of the dark and ancient walls. I recognized in him the\r\npersonal attraction that Extremists always have—the freedom from\r\nhesitation and half-measures, the delight in conflict, the reckless\r\ndisregard of self. When to this attraction his own people could add\r\nhis personal and intimate acquaintance with all classes among them\r\ndown to the poorest villagers, and his steady maintenance of all that\r\nthey held most dear in religious belief and customary observances, I\r\ncould not wonder at his influence among them. So he stood surrounded\r\nby the ruins of empires built by his own and other races, while, with\r\nthe merriment and ironic humour I knew so well, our soldiers of the\r\nhelio party folded up their instruments among the rocks close by and\r\nprepared for night.[18]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[15] Compare the Attis of Catullus LXIII. 50. “Patria o mei creatrix,\r\npatria o mea genetrix.... Ego gymnasei fui flos,” etc.\r\n\r\n[16] Report in Mr. Tilak’s paper, the _Mahratta_, January 13, 1907.\r\n\r\n[17] Report in the _Mahratta_, June 30, 1907.\r\n\r\n[18] On June 24, 1908, Mr. Tilak was again arrested for alleged\r\nsedition contained in an article of the _Kesari_, commenting on\r\nthe suppressive measures introduced after the discovery of bombs\r\nin Calcutta. He was tried in Bombay before Mr. Justice Davar and a\r\nspecial jury of seven Europeans and two Parsis. The jury was unable\r\nto agree, but the judge accepted the verdict of guilty from seven\r\nagainst two, and Mr. Tilak was sentenced to six years’ transportation\r\nand a fine of 1000 rupees (July 22, 1908).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE RYOT’S BURDEN\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral times in Poona I met a Mr. Junshi (as I will call him),\r\nwho lived in one of the beautiful houses the Mahrattas used to\r\nbuild while their Peshwas still reigned. He was an oldish man, for\r\nan Indian, but thin, bright-eyed and alert, and from his mouth\r\nstatistics flowed like water from a fountain statue. One day I called\r\non him, and was shown into the open courtyard of old marble and teak,\r\nround which the main building rose in three stories; but beyond I\r\ncould see another courtyard, more beautiful and cooler still, where\r\nlived his wife, his sons’ wives, his nieces, and other ladies of\r\nthe blood, and beyond that again there was a glimpse of leaves and\r\nbrilliant flowers.\r\n\r\n“We require flowers,” he said, “for the worship of our idols. We\r\nworship our idols here in the house every morning and evening,\r\nhanging garlands round their necks and placing bunches of flowers\r\nbefore them. You, I believe, worship only once a week.”\r\n\r\nI told him I had been brought up on family prayers that never failed\r\nin regularity, even when we were at the seaside, and this pleased him\r\nvery much.\r\n\r\n“However,” he went on, “I think we have an advantage in acknowledging\r\nso many gods in our pantheon that each of us can choose which\r\nhe likes best. For each of our idols is a symbol of some divine\r\nattribute, and helps the worshipper to fix his thoughts upon the\r\nattribute he most desires to worship.”\r\n\r\n“But some of us also,” I said, “find it helpful to contemplate images\r\nrepresenting the attributes of motherly love, chastity, compassion,\r\nor courage in the face of evil; and we offer flowers to them.”\r\n\r\nThis pleased him too, but when we reached his long room upstairs we\r\nturned from idols to the main interest of his life. On bookshelves\r\nround the walls, and heaped upon the floor and tables, were hundreds\r\nof volumes and pamphlets crammed with figures. It seemed as if the\r\nowner had collected every book and essay ever written upon the\r\neconomics of India, and year by year had filtered them into his mind.\r\nHe had the instinct for averages which I take to be the economist’s\r\ninstinct. He thought of women and children in terms of addition; he\r\nsaw men as columns walking. He watched the rising and falling curves\r\nof revenue, expenditure, and population as others watch the curves\r\nof beauty. Any line of figures was welcome to his spirit, and though\r\nhe had made his living by teaching little Indians to read “Robinson\r\nCrusoe,” his chief study seemed to lie in the scripture called the\r\n“Statistical Abstract relating to British India.” Upon this careful\r\npiece of literature he meditated day and night; or, if his mind\r\nrequired a change, he relaxed it on theology.\r\n\r\nI have called the “Statistical Abstract” literature, and to him it\r\nwas so. To him it was as pleasing as a poem to know that under the\r\nheading of “Priests and others engaged in religion,” the number of\r\n“total supported” was 2,728,812, among whom 178,656 females were\r\nclassified as “actual workers”; or that the total supported by\r\n“indefinite and disreputable occupations” was 737,033, and in this\r\nclass alone the male and female “actual workers” were approximately\r\nequal. He liked to meditate on the daily average of prisoners in the\r\nvarious provinces, and on the infirmities of population according\r\nto residence and according to age. It was good to know that there\r\nwere about 6,000,000 more males than females in the country, but\r\n18,000,000 more widows than widowers, and 391,000 widows under\r\nfifteen. These were the lyrics or realistic ballads of his reading,\r\nbut he took higher interest in the figures that move with something\r\nof epic grandeur. To him there was a splendour and æsthetic\r\nsatisfaction in knowing that the total of India’s population,\r\nincluding the Native States, was 294,361,056 in 1901, and that of\r\nthis number 207,050,557 were Hindus like himself; while agriculture\r\nsupported 191,691,731—close upon two-thirds, or 65·16 per cent., as\r\nhe put it—and 15,686,421 (including nearly 1,000,000 females) could\r\nwrite and read, a total of 1,125,231 being “literate in English.”\r\n\r\nBut I think, after all, it was the great passage headed “Finance”\r\nthat he enjoyed with the most delicate appreciation for style.\r\nPerhaps it depended on his mood whether he more admired the lines\r\nof the “Gross Revenue and Expenditure” or of the “Net Revenue\r\nand Expenditure.” It was sonorous as a hexameter to read aloud\r\nthat the total gross revenue in India and England for 1905-6 was\r\n£84,997,685, and the total gross expenditure charged to revenue was\r\n£82,905,831. But the net statements of revenue at £48,539,680, and\r\nexpenditure at £46,447,826, were trim as a sonnet. It was a dubious\r\npoint, but for details he certainly preferred the gross, thinking\r\nthem more realistic, and his favourite passage was that beginning,\r\n“Principal heads of Revenue, Land Revenue, £18,862,169, for 1905-6.”\r\nAgainst this he would set, as a kind of antiphone, the gross\r\nexpenditure on army services (excluding Marine and Military Works) of\r\n£19,267,130.[19]\r\n\r\nThere were two passages also from which he appeared to derive the\r\nkind of savage pleasure most men seek in tragedy or satire. One was\r\nthat the gross expenditure on education by the Government of India\r\namounted to less than £1,700,000 in 1905-6, and he worked out the\r\nState expenditure for education for the current year (1907-8) at\r\n1½_d._ per head in India, as against 5_s._ 4_d._ per head in France.\r\nThe other was that the Hindus, Mohammedans, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists,\r\nand Animists contributed out of their labour during the year of grace\r\nwhich we had just survived (1906-7) the sum of £125,906 in order\r\nthat the British residents might not be devoid of the consolations\r\nof religion as represented by Bishops and Anglican chaplains, Roman\r\npriests, Presbyterian divines, and cemeteries.\r\n\r\nFor myself, there was, of course, a certain ironic interest in the\r\nendowment of an Anglo-Indian’s Christianity by the natives around\r\nhim, and for the first time I was inclined to favour a system of\r\npayment by results. But, in regard to Finance, all such things are\r\ninsignificant in comparison with the one main question of the tax\r\nupon the cultivator.[20]\r\n\r\nAn immemorial custom in India, consolidated in the Laws of Manu,\r\ngave the ruler a share in all crops—a fraction fluctuating according\r\nto the soil, but not higher than one quarter. Probably this was a\r\ntribute levied upon the village community in return for protection,\r\nor simply as a penalty for conquest. It was paid in kind, so much\r\ngrain from so much crop, and as the proportion was always the same on\r\nthe same ground, the peasant did not feel the variation in quantity\r\nmuch. But having inherited the custom, the British rulers found it\r\nmore convenient and uniform to collect the tax in cash, and to levy\r\nthe rate, not in proportion to each year’s crop, but on a valuation\r\nthat remains unaltered for long terms of years—usually thirty years\r\nin Madras and Bombay, but twenty years in other places, for instance\r\nin the Punjab. This process of valuation is called the Settlement,\r\nand Settlement Officers are almost continually engaged in drawing\r\nup a kind of progressive Doomsday Book upon the fields, pastures,\r\nwoods, and wells of each village. It is hardly possible to ascertain\r\nthe exact proportion of value fixed by the Settlement Officers as\r\nthe tax. Throughout India there is a general understanding that\r\n“about one-half of the well-ascertained net assets should be the\r\nGovernment demand.”[21] This income tax of ten shillings in the pound\r\nis, however, in reality a fairly steady minimum, and the tax often\r\ngoes higher, to say nothing of the “cesses” or local taxes nominally\r\nlevied for roads and education.\r\n\r\nWhether the money is called tax or rent, would not seem at first\r\nsight to make much difference; for it has to be paid and the people\r\nwho pay it have no voice in its levy or in its expenditure. If it\r\nis a tax, it is a large income tax on land, fixed for some years\r\nand collected from the smallest landowners as well as the largest.\r\nIf it is a rent, the system is partial land-nationalization without\r\nnational control and without economic freedom. But as a matter of\r\npractice, the difference in the use of words is vital, and it cannot\r\nbe put more plainly than in the Minute written by Lord Salisbury when\r\nhe was Secretary of State for India in 1875:—\r\n\r\n  “If we say that it is rent, the modern Indian statesman will hold\r\n  the Government in strictness entitled to all that remains after\r\n  wages and profits have been paid, and he will do what he can to\r\n  hasten the advent of the day when the State shall no longer be\r\n  kept by any weak compromises from the enjoyment of its undoubted\r\n  rights. If we persuade him that it is revenue, he will note the\r\n  vast disproportion of its incidence compared to that of other\r\n  taxes, and his efforts will tend to remedy the inequality, and to\r\n  lay upon other classes and interests a more equitable share of the\r\n  fiscal burden. I prefer the latter tendency to the former.”[22]\r\n\r\nThe average Indian official does not agree with Lord Salisbury. He\r\nprefers the rent theory to the tax theory, and when the cultivator\r\nhas been allowed his subsistence off the holding, together with what\r\nthe official estimates as profit, the rent is taken in the name\r\nof revenue, but under the excuse of rent, and I have often heard\r\nofficials urge the theory of land nationalization in their defence.\r\nIt is, however, as I said, a nationalization in which the conditions\r\nof political and economic freedom are absent.\r\n\r\nThe new assessment, which in Bombay lasts for thirty years, depends\r\nalmost entirely on the discretion of the Settlement Officer. His\r\ndecision is supervised by higher authorities, but it usually stands,\r\nand the only fixed rule for his guidance is that he may not increase\r\nthe revenue of a Taluka (group of villages) by more than 33 per\r\ncent., nor that of a single village by more than 66 per cent., nor\r\nthat of a single holding by more than 100 per cent. This leaves\r\nhim plenty of margin, and in fifteen large districts of the Bombay\r\nPresidency we find that the average increase was 30·4 per cent. at\r\nthe last assessment (1899).[23] This increase is assessed, not on\r\nthe yield of the ground, but on the “capabilities” of the ground,\r\nand “capabilities” are calculated upon the quality of the soil,\r\nthe average rainfall, the market, the railway, and other elements\r\nof “unearned increment.” Mr. Vaughan Nash’s account of the matter\r\nexpresses what happens:—\r\n\r\n  “The officer appointed to value the land and fix the assessment\r\n  has made his shot—I use the expression advisedly—at the average\r\n  crop, and has determined the demand which is to hold for the next\r\n  twenty or thirty years; and in theory it is understood that the\r\n  cultivator is to enjoy not less than half the profits of his farm,\r\n  beside the privilege of subsisting on its produce.... At the end\r\n  of the assessment period the authorities make another shot; and\r\n  now mark what happens. They find that since their last valuation\r\n  prices have advanced, new railways have been made, cultivation has\r\n  been intensified—or might be intensified, under a little pressure;\r\n  and, after the due application of tests of all kinds, geological,\r\n  botanical, hydrographical, meteorological, arboricultural, etc., it\r\n  is discovered that land and farmer can bear an extra 30 per cent.\r\n  or so on the old assessment.”[24]\r\n\r\nWe may assume the Settlement Officer to be a scrupulously honest\r\nand painstaking public servant. Let us assume that his knowledge of\r\nagriculture and local conditions is equal to his devotion. Still his\r\nresponsibility is almost too great for the wisest and most zealous\r\nofficial. It is his official duty to raise as much as he decently can\r\nfor the Government, whether he calls the sum tax or rent or share\r\nof profits. Against his decision there can be no resistance and no\r\npracticable appeal. The cultivator is not in reality a free agent in\r\nthe new bargain, and if he protests that the payment is beyond his\r\nincome, he is informed that, being incapable of cultivating his own\r\nland to the highest advantage, he must learn better or go.\r\n\r\nUsually he does neither. In most cases he has no opportunity for\r\nlearning better, and he cannot, or does not, go. He borrows. An\r\nanonymous writer once attacked me with scorn for saying that a large\r\nproportion of cultivators in Bombay were receiving no net income, no\r\nprofits for themselves at all; they were simply existing on their\r\nland, and for their few clothes, medicines, and family festivals they\r\nwere trying to get outside work, selling their family bangles, or\r\nappealing to the money-lender on the off-chance that a “bumper crop”\r\nmight enable them to pay something some day.\r\n\r\n  “According to Mr. Nevinson,” cried this anonymous writer, “the\r\n  ryots in the Presidency are such simpletons as to go on cultivating\r\n  land, their income from such cultivation being always equalled\r\n  by their cultivation expenses. Why, then, do they cultivate at\r\n  all, when obviously by abandoning the land and its profitless\r\n  cultivation they could at once better their position by devoting to\r\n  other work the time and labour they now expend on cultivation.”[25]\r\n\r\nThe question is worthy of the old professorial economists, who never\r\nwent beyond books for knowledge, and settled the affairs of human\r\nnature in their studies by their own conceptions of reason. They\r\nused to tell us that, when one trade failed, the labour devoted to\r\nit became absorbed in other occupations. I have often wondered, if\r\ntheir trade of theorizing failed, in what other occupation their\r\nlabour would become absorbed. A large number of our Indian officials\r\nspend nearly the whole of their time dealing with abstractions and\r\ncases on paper, their feet under their writing-tables. The increasing\r\npressure of the daily routine drives them further and further from\r\nreality, and one might suppose that this anonymous writer had never\r\nbeen face to face with a peasant in his home, or known anything of\r\nthe peasant’s clinging to the land, or ever been thrown out of work\r\nand compelled to face starvation for a single day himself.\r\n\r\nWhat I said was perfectly accurate. The Indian cultivator will cling\r\nto his land even when he makes no profit beyond his subsistence wage.\r\nI believe the same to be true of peasant proprietors or small holders\r\nin nearly every country; certainly it is true in France, Russia,\r\nand Ireland, for I have known cases in all three countries. So the\r\nIndian cultivator, when he makes no profit and is called upon for\r\nincreased assessment or his daughter’s marriage, does not at once\r\nset off to Bombay and become a watchmaker or a docker, as economists\r\nthink he ought. As I said, he borrows. Usually he goes to the village\r\nmoney-lender (banya or sowkar), and receives advances at 12 to 30\r\nper cent. per annum, according to his character in the village. In\r\nreality, I think, the money-lender speculates on the chance of a\r\n“bumper crop” every few years, but in the last resort he may sell up\r\nthe cultivator through the civil courts in Bombay, or convert him\r\ninto his own labourer to work the land for him on a subsistence wage.\r\nIn hopes of saving the ryot from this extortion, the Government has\r\ndevised agricultural banks and other schemes for advancing loans at\r\nthe reasonable interest of 5 per cent., and in course of time this\r\nbenefit will probably increase. But at present the economists, as\r\nusual, have made the mistake of omitting the uncertain element in\r\nman, and he yet continues to prefer his familiar old money-lender\r\nto the most advantageous Government loan. In some districts I have\r\nheard there is a national feeling about it, but I suppose the chief\r\nreason really is that the Government claims its interest down on the\r\nnail for a fixed day, whereas the village money-lender can often be\r\ncajoled, bribed, frightened, or persuaded, like a reasonable tailor,\r\nto put off the dreaded moment of demand.\r\n\r\nThe actual cash amount of the assessment is not such an important\r\nquestion to the cultivator as its proportion to his income. The\r\nfigures given for Deccan villages by Mr. Vaughan Nash in his “Family\r\nBudgets,” show an assessment of about two shillings an acre.[26]\r\nMany of the villages I visited were probably poorer, being in the\r\nmountains, but the average assessment tax in them appeared to be\r\nonly a little over one shilling an acre, and sometimes as low as\r\nfivepence, on an average holding of twenty acres. The assessment, as\r\nI said, has now to be paid in cash on a certain day, often while the\r\ncrop is still growing. If payment is not made, everything the peasant\r\npossesses can be seized and sold by the Revenue authorities—house\r\nand land, plough and oxen, bedding and cooking pot. That is the\r\nmoney-lender’s opportunity, and in practice it is usually the\r\nmoney-lender who hands over the cash. If he refuses a further\r\nadvance, the Government is compelled either to cancel the debt (which\r\nis now often done in famine seasons), or to suspend the debt till\r\nnext harvest (which is frequently done, but only puts off the evil\r\nday), or to sell the peasant up, which usually yields a very small\r\nprice, and sometimes produces serious disturbances, as in the Deccan\r\nriots of 1875, when the money-lenders were burnt out and driven from\r\nthe village.[27]\r\n\r\nAs is well known, nearly all the land in the Bombay Presidency, and\r\nfar the greater part of Madras, is held on this “ryotwari” system,\r\nor peasant tenantry to the State, there being no intermediary at law\r\nbetween the Government and the cultivator, though the money-lender\r\noften acts as such. In many other provinces the land is owned\r\nby landlords, or “zemindars,” much as in our own country, and\r\nthe revenue is taken from them, though it is ultimately paid by\r\nthe cultivator. In Bengal the zemindars were granted a Permanent\r\nSettlement in 1793, which fixed the demands of the State so that\r\nno further assessment has been instituted, and revenue stands at\r\nan almost constant figure. The Rent Acts of 1859 and 1885 aimed at\r\nprotecting the cultivators from the usual abuses and extortions of\r\nthe landlord system, but whether the Permanent Settlement, which, of\r\ncourse, involves a great loss of revenue to Government, is justified\r\nor not by its results—whether the greater prosperity and intelligence\r\nof Bengal arise from the moderation and fixity of the assessment, or\r\nare due to climate, race, and enterprise, is one of those questions\r\nthat are argued between officials and educated Indians with a kind of\r\nperpetual motion. A similar Permanent Settlement for the whole of\r\nIndia was proposed by Lord Canning just before his death in 1862, but\r\nfinally abandoned twenty years later, after laborious discussion.[28]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RYOT’S HOME.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARRYING LEAVES FOR FUEL.\r\n\r\n  [_Face p. 92._\r\n]\r\n\r\nOn leaving even small and beautiful cities like Poona you pass\r\nthrough a zone where the inhabitants enjoy the health and suffer\r\nfrom the scrappiness of suburbs. Here they live partly by gardening,\r\npartly by burning lime or working in the town, and their houses\r\nhave a touch of urban refinement. The ceilings and the tops of the\r\nwalls, for instance, are hung with those garish pictures of religious\r\nsubjects—the adventures of Krishna, and other scenes—which would\r\nprovide so suitable a market for German art. But the suburbs are\r\nshort, within a few miles you enter the heart of the country, and in\r\nhis primeval village are brought face to face with the ryot—the\r\ncultivator of the soil, the basis of the Indian Empire, the one man\r\nfor whom, or at least by means of whom, all the rest of the intricate\r\nmachinery exists, from the splendours of Simla down to the office of\r\nthe “Remembrancer of Legal Affairs,” and the “Finger-print Bureau,”\r\nin Poona’s residential quarter, or to Lord Kitchener’s reviews in the\r\nPoona cantonment.\r\n\r\nIn my various journeys within a circle of twenty miles round the\r\ncity, I found the ryot much what I had expected—gentle-mannered,\r\npatient, hardy, and incredibly thin, living with his family in a\r\nclean but dusty hut, furnished with little beyond a few brass pots\r\nand dishes. All day he was working in his field, and he gathered for\r\nconverse at evening—“cow-dust time,” as they call it—on the steps of\r\nthe village temple, in which a vague red image represents the idea of\r\nhelpful strength—something like Hercules or the Archangel Michael;\r\nfor it is the same Maruta who helped Rama on his wandering search for\r\nthe beloved Sita.\r\n\r\nI have never heard even the most frigid official speak evil of the\r\nryot. As the best patronizers in the world, we find in the ryot a\r\nmost suitable object for our characteristic capacity. Hard-working,\r\nsober, and reverential beyond the dreams of country parsons, he is\r\nexactly the sort of being to whom we enjoy extending the kindly and\r\nprotective sympathy due from a squire to his villagers. Just as in\r\nNatal or Nigeria every one is ready to commend the untutored savage\r\nand pat his curly head provided he remains savage, so in India even\r\nthe Anglo-Indian will admit a distant affection for the poor dear\r\nryot, and regrets the good old times when hardly an Indian of them\r\nall made pretence to further education or equality. But education and\r\nequality are the two things that undermine our accustomed pedestal,\r\nand the thought of a time when we might no longer be required to\r\nexercise our national function of patronage fills us with dismay.\r\n\r\nThe crop and the assessment are the two kindred and vital points\r\nin the ryot’s earthly life, as distinguished from the life of his\r\nspirit. In the Deccan, as in all parts of India, the crop is simply\r\na matter of opportune rainfall, and when I was in Poona there had\r\nbeen no good crop for fifteen years. That autumn the prospect was a\r\nlittle worse than ordinarily poor, though the main famine district of\r\nthe year was in the United Provinces, far away north. Preparations\r\nfor a serious famine had to be made already, for, as Sir William\r\nHunter estimated, one-fifth of India’s population—say sixty million\r\nsouls—are perpetually living on insufficient food, apart from\r\nfamines; and, partly owing to the export-trade, the villagers no\r\nlonger store grain to meet an evil day, nor do they possess cash to\r\npurchase grain from other parts of the country. So when the pinch\r\nof scarcity comes, the land-owning or land-taxing Government alone\r\nstands between them and starvation; and, indeed, the Government\r\nprides itself at all times upon its service as protector of the\r\npoor, especially against other landlords and money-lenders. There is\r\nalways a good deal of justice in the claim, even when the Government,\r\nhaving first tempered the wind, proceeds to shear the lamb. But\r\nfamine is the special opportunity for Government beneficence. All\r\nofficials then vie with each other in the thankless labour of holding\r\nthe bodies and souls of thousands together, and within a month of\r\nhis landing as Governor of Bombay, Sir George Clarke had all his\r\npreparations ready for relief works, terracing of hills, sinking of\r\nwells, and remission (not merely suspension) of the year’s assessment\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nOf the assessment and of famine I had heard and read a great deal\r\nbefore, but one set of grievances, closely connected with both,\r\nwas new to me. It arose from the Forest Laws—a subject we hardly\r\nconsider in England unless we are thinking of William Rufus or the\r\ngame-preserves of kilted City Fathers in the Highlands. The present\r\nstrict system of forest preservation was, I believe, instituted\r\nafter the terrible famine of 1877-78, with the admirable intention\r\nof restoring the rainfall. In old times the village communities\r\nmaintained a tract of communal forest for grazing and fuel near\r\neach village, just as they did formerly in England, and still do\r\nin Russia. An ancient Indian custom set aside an acre of grazing\r\nfor every acre of cultivated land. But under our rule the influence\r\nof village communities was to a great extent destroyed, because we\r\nremembered nothing like it in England, and the plough was suffered to\r\nencroach upon the forest till there was a real danger that no forest\r\nwould be left and the rains would cease. Nothing could be better\r\nthan the intention of the Forest Department in checking the process\r\ncalled “denudation,” but instead of restoring the control of forests\r\nto the villagers themselves under definite rules of maintenance,\r\nthey centralized the managements as bureaucrats will, declared\r\nuncultivated land to be Government forest, prohibited wood-gathering\r\nor cattle-grazing without payment, let out the grass and timber by\r\nauction to contractors, and entered the proceeds to the advantage\r\nof the Department. There is no denying the benefits to Government\r\nand the contractors. The destruction of forest is checked, hay and\r\nfuel are supplied to the cavalry cantonments and cities, and the\r\nDepartment (including Burma) contributes a net sum of about £800,000\r\na year to the Indian exchequer.[29] Could anything be more desirable?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ON THE CAUSEWAY.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A VILLAGE HEADMAN.]\r\n\r\n“But how about my buffalo?” cries the thin ryot of the valley. As\r\nMr. Vaughan Nash said in his book on the Famine, the buffalo is\r\nquite as necessary to the Indian peasant as a boat to a fisherman.\r\nBuffaloes are necessary for work on the fields, manure for the soil,\r\nand milk for the family, to say nothing of fuel and flooring. No one\r\nwho, like myself, has lived much in Kaffir huts with cow-dung floors,\r\nor has cooked on the veldt for weeks together with cow-dung as fuel,\r\nwill make light of such uses. But still, when wood is to be had, only\r\na fool uses cow-dung for cooking or even for flooring. In the Indian\r\nforests, wood is to be had, but the Forest Laws forbid the people to\r\nuse it, and they are driven to floor and cook with the cow-dung that\r\nought rightly to go as manure for the fields.\r\n\r\nBut the grazing is the chief difficulty, now that the old communal\r\nlands are being swallowed up by the Forest Department. The villagers\r\nmay earn a few pence by cutting grass for the contractor who carts\r\nit away to the city, but the hungry buffaloes look up and are not\r\nfed. Even where a grazing allotment is made, it is too small, and I\r\nwas in a village fifteen miles from Poona where the twelve families\r\ncould afford to keep only one buffalo between them, and they had to\r\npay rent to the Forest Department for the right of grazing that one\r\nbuffalo and a few goats upon little patches of the vast hillsides,\r\nall of which they regarded as the common lands of the village for\r\ncenturies past. The rent, no doubt, was very small, probably only\r\na few shillings a year for the buffalo and goats, but the village\r\nincome was very small too.\r\n\r\nFrom the bureaucracy’s well-intentioned schemes, other peculiar\r\nresults arise which perhaps did not occur to those who framed\r\nthe laws. One case, for instance, was mentioned to me by several\r\nvillagers as a kind of typical or proverbial absurdity. A waggon\r\nbroke its wheel and the owner began to mend it. The village police,\r\nhearing the hammer, arrested him under Section E, paragraph 109 (or\r\nsome such clause) of the Forest Laws, upon the charge of practising\r\ncarpentry within a mile of the forest limit. In his innocence, he\r\nasked what he ought to have done to get his waggon home over the\r\nfew hundred yards to his door. He was informed that he ought to\r\nhave walked into Poona, twenty or thirty miles away, discovered the\r\noffice of the Forest Department, waited till the proper official,\r\nwho would very likely be in the country, returned to town, stated\r\nhis case, and asked for a legal certificate authorizing him to cut\r\ntimber for the repairs of his wheel on the spot. Then, with good\r\nluck, within a week or ten days from the accident, he might have\r\nfound himself in a position to drive his waggon home in accordance\r\nwith bureaucratic regulations. I believe, however, that this rule has\r\nnow been modified, and that the man would only have to hunt a forest\r\nranger for permission. But take another grievance, which recalls\r\nchildhood’s memories of the Norman Conquest. The ryot’s little\r\nwealth of crop and stock is continually exposed to wild beasts—deer,\r\nwolves, panthers, and boars—just as our farmers’ crops are exposed to\r\nhares and rabbits. But under the Arms Act, the ryot has little chance\r\nof killing them himself. His duty is to walk into the nearest town\r\nand report the presence of a wild beast to the police. The police\r\nlook round for an Englishman who wants something to kill. Frequently\r\nthey advertise for one in the local papers, and usually they have not\r\nto wait very long. Off goes the Englishman—rifle, tiffin-basket, boy,\r\nbedding, and all. But in the meantime it is not improbable that the\r\nwild beast has walked away, or founded a whole new family even worse\r\nthan himself. At the best, it is just possible that the Englishman\r\nmay miss him.\r\n\r\nWhile I was in India a movement was started for the protection of the\r\nhelpless ryot from deer. In many parts of the country, especially in\r\nRajputana and the Central Provinces, you may frequently see herds\r\nof deer and antelopes browsing upon the standing crops, to the\r\ngreat loss of the cultivator. It was alleged that the increase of\r\ndeer was due to the gradual reduction of tigers (which are nature’s\r\nown corrective), and the proposal was to discourage the slaughter\r\nof tigers by withdrawing the Government reward of £3 6_s._ 8_d._ a\r\nhead, or even to forbid the sport of shooting tigers unless they\r\nwere proved by experience to be man-eaters. Personally, I think\r\nthe latter regulation would be good, for the deer would be reduced,\r\nthe crops protected, and the tigers increased. But I am not sure\r\nhow far a ryot, in the interests of agriculture, would approve of a\r\nregulation that allowed one tiger one man.\r\n\r\nThe main grievances of the ryot against the Forest Department may be\r\nseen briefly stated in a memorial presented to the Governor of Madras\r\nby the cultivators of eight villages in the Salem district, April,\r\n1908. The Forest Department proposed to reserve the Anurath Hills\r\nin the neighbourhood of the villages, and the memorial protested\r\nthat already there was not much waste land for grazing, and hardly\r\nenough land even for cultivation. To reserve the hills would also\r\ndeprive the villagers of wood and fuel, and inflict a kind of double\r\nassessment:—\r\n\r\n  “You settle our lands,” said the memorial, “every thirty years\r\n  and raise the assessment. To pay this assessment we ought to\r\n  cultivate our land with the aid of good manure. To have manure we\r\n  must maintain sufficient stock of cattle. When we enter the forest\r\n  to procure fodder, you demand permit fees; thus you demand double\r\n  payment (one in the shape of land assessment and the other in the\r\n  shape of forest fees) for the lands we cultivate.”\r\n\r\nThe memorial went on to say that, owing to the rigour of forest\r\nadministration, the villagers, to protect themselves, had to bribe\r\nthe subordinate officials of the Forest Department, and it concluded\r\nwith the words:—\r\n\r\n  “We lead a peaceful life. It is the policy of the Government to\r\n  keep every ryot in a contented and happy state. But in order\r\n  to secure additional forest revenue, if you permit the Forest\r\n  officials to enclose an additional reserve against our wishes,\r\n  you will create much heart-burning and discontent against the\r\n  Government.”\r\n\r\nBut let us put things at their best. Let us suppose there is neither\r\ndrought, nor famine, nor plague. Let us assume that the assessment\r\nhas been paid without borrowing, and the Forest Laws observed or\r\nevaded, that wild beasts have been killed, and yet the deer have not\r\ndamaged the crops. Let us suppose that the ryot’s income reaches\r\nthe highest possible average, which Lord Curzon calculated at £2 a\r\nyear per head of the population, including all the rich merchants,\r\nbankers, and landowners. It is next to impossible that the average\r\nincome in any village could be as much as that, but let us assume it\r\nis. Still it remains at only half what is spent per head in England\r\nevery year on drink alone. It represents a standard of poverty which\r\nwe can hardly conceive—a level where every fraction of a farthing\r\ncounts. And yet I found within twenty miles of Poona a group of\r\nvillages where the ryots clubbed together of their own accord to hire\r\na schoolmaster at a salary of eight shillings a month. In face of\r\na sacrifice so astonishing it appeared to me that all the outcries\r\nabout the dangers of education in India that were then filling\r\nthe speeches of our statesmen and the columns of the _Times_ and\r\nAnglo-Indian papers, might with good hope be accounted vain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A TEMPLE TANK, MADRAS.\r\n\r\n  [_Face p. 102._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[19] The total military expenditure for India, including Marine,\r\nMilitary Works, etc., was £21,586,086 for 1906-7, but this was\r\nreduced in the following year to £20,520,500.

His general conclusion is that\r\nthe Indian system of land-tenure is something intermediate between\r\ncomplete nationalization and absolute private property. “To the\r\nextent of one-half the State is able to appropriate that unearned\r\nincrement in rental incomes which is due to the development of the\r\ncountry. But, except for this contribution to the public exchequer,\r\nthe economic position of the landlord is not affected by the land\r\nrevenue laws. He receives rent for the use of the national and\r\nindestructible properties of the soil, and he raises that rent when\r\nthe growth of population and the development of the country makes it\r\nprofitable to bring poorer lands under cultivation.” In saying this,\r\nMr. Morison is, however, obviously thinking only of a zemindar or\r\nlandlord district, such as the United Province, with which his book\r\nchiefly deals.\r\n\r\n[29] The net profit on Forest Revenue for 1905-6 was £824,748. In the\r\nfour previous years it had risen by nearly £100,000 a year, but in\r\n1907-8 it dropped to £756,100, chiefly owing to a fall of price in\r\nBurma.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE SOUTHERN CITY\r\n\r\n\r\nMadras, the most Oriental of the great Indian cities, is well known\r\nto English people as the first foothold of Elizabethan merchants,\r\nthe fortress of Clive, and the coral strand where little English\r\nboys used to convert their patient bearers. But apart from these\r\nassociations, the mother city of Southern India has a peculiar\r\ncharacter of her own. Her reformers talk with confidence of the dry\r\nlight of reason in Madras. They pride themselves on the logic and\r\nunimpassioned judgment of her mind. They point to the neighbouring\r\nState of Mysore to show what Southern Indians like themselves can\r\ndo in the way of political advancement, and to Travancore as the\r\nmost highly educated part of India—the State where women have most\r\nfreedom, both to gather knowledge and to enjoy their home or leave\r\nit. The whole of South India, but especially the city of Madras\r\nitself, they regard as a reserve of intellectual force, always ready\r\nto support the new spirit that has appeared in the north and west,\r\nand destined ultimately to take the lead in the general movement of\r\nreform.\r\n\r\nCertainly I noticed signs of a practical intelligence that might be\r\ncalled dry. Hour after hour, on a steaming afternoon, I listened to\r\nthe Madras members of the municipal corporation arguing in protest\r\nagainst the English members and officials about the position of\r\nstandpipes, and the adulteration of ghee with oil, and of rice with\r\nsand, while the President, in the broadest Scots, kept calling on\r\nthem to address the chair, or declaring their motion lost. When\r\nI was in Madras also, the Decentralization Commission, under Mr.\r\nCharles Hobhouse, at that time Under-Secretary for India, began its\r\nsession, and the educated citizens followed the chaotic windings\r\nof its questions and evidence with minute accuracy, all the more\r\neager, perhaps, because Mr. Romesh Dutt, the national authority on\r\nIndian economics, was among the Commissioners. It was even more\r\nsignificant that Madras, the devoted home of Hinduism and of Vishnu’s\r\nworshippers, should have steadily chosen her leading Mohammedan\r\ncitizen as her representative upon the Viceroy’s Council. One may\r\ncall this a sign of practical intelligence and the dry light of\r\nreason, because they could not have chosen a better member than Nawab\r\nSyed Mohammed, descendant of our old enemy Tippoo Sultan, and their\r\ndeep sense of religion did not deter them from the choice. Calm,\r\nmodest, and generally silent but for a few definite words thrown into\r\na discussion, he seemed an ideal member for any Council.\r\n\r\nYet, though the boast of reason’s dry light is justified, the\r\npervading tone of Madras, and probably of all Southern India, is\r\nnot practical logic, but imaginative religion. One sometimes finds\r\nthe two things in attractive combination. I had gone out one early\r\nmorning to visit the god in his beautiful temple at Mailapur, not\r\nvery far from the widespread “compounds” of park and garden, where\r\nthe happy English and a few rich Indians reside, two or three miles\r\ninland from the sea and the jumbled “Black Town” of crowded natives.\r\nThere, as I stood by the edge of the temple tank covered with the\r\nlotus, I came upon an elderly Hindu reading at the door of his modest\r\nhome. The verandah was partly arranged as a stable for the sacred\r\ncow, partly laid with mats for beggars, wanderers, or religious\r\nteachers who might be seeking a shelter for the night. The man had\r\nbathed in the tank and washed his only garment of a long cotton\r\ncloth, as he did every morning himself, following the cleanly and\r\nchivalrous Indian custom. He was a schoolmaster, with a fixed salary\r\nof £3 6_s._ 8_d._ a month. Upon this he mainly supported his sons and\r\ntheir wives and children, all of whom lived in his house, under the\r\ndirection of his widowed mother, who arranged which of the married\r\ncouples should occupy the married quarters in turn, as there was\r\nnot room to supply married quarters for all. In gratitude for her\r\nservices, and in reverence for motherhood, “which is the centre of\r\nhuman life,” he told me how every morning members of the family\r\nwashed the widow’s feet and covered them with flowers, as though they\r\nwere the feet of a divinity.\r\n\r\nThe day being a religious holiday—a festival of Shiva, destroyer\r\nand healer—he was spending the quiet hours in meditating upon God,\r\nand reading a large volume of Professor William James’s “Principles\r\nof Psychology.” In religion he was inclined to the Monist view that\r\nthe spirit of man is identical in essence with the spirit of God,\r\nbut admitted that he felt no violent enmity towards the Dualists,\r\nwho maintain a difference in essence. He wore on his forehead the\r\nthree strong lines of white and vermillion, which represent the\r\nfootprint of Vishnu, the maintainer of existence, and pronounce the\r\nwearer to be a reverential servant to the god’s commands. But, here\r\nagain, he felt no enmity towards the worshippers of Shiva, who draw\r\nthree parallel lines in grey or yellow earth across their brows. His\r\ntrue interest lay in the region of philosophy, and as a Monist his\r\nconception of the universe hardly differed from Spinozism, unless\r\nit be said that he went beyond Spinoza in his belief in a universal\r\nConsciousness, the subtle waves of which he could himself universally\r\nperceive if only his mind were not too gross an instrument of\r\nperception. All through his life he had striven to purify and\r\netherialize that instrument by clean feeding and the practice of\r\nconcentration. He had never touched flesh or strong drink or tobacco.\r\nBy practising for an increasing time every day, he had been able\r\nto fix his mind on eternal truths with such absorption that the\r\ntransitory things no longer disturbed his meditation, and he had\r\nacquired new and subtle powers, enabling him dimly to perceive a\r\nconsciousness in the air and so-called inanimate objects. He could\r\nsometimes even feel the impalpable workings of Karma—the influence of\r\nman’s reputed good or evil deeds working upon his own destiny, and\r\naffecting even the infinitesimal atoms of the universe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SERVANT OF VISHNU.\r\n\r\n  [_Face p. 106._\r\n]\r\n\r\nHe now longed to retire from the world, to lay aside his sacred\r\nthread—the triple thread of Brahmans—and devote to contemplation the\r\nfew years left. But the size of his patriarchal household, and the\r\nnecessity of making that 16_s._ 8_d._ a week restrained him, and, of\r\ncourse, his motives were laudable. Nevertheless, as usually happens,\r\nit would have been better for himself and his family if he had flung\r\naway his obvious duties and followed the call of his higher thoughts\r\nalone. For as I came away after receiving sour milk, and the usual\r\npan leaf enclosing a bit of spice and beetel-nut to chew, one of his\r\nsons—an inferior telegraph clerk—stole after me to ask my advice\r\nabout £2, which he had forwarded to a swindling Trust Company that\r\nplays the confidence trick with Congo Bonds and other ludicrous\r\nimpostures. It was pitiful to think that the £2, now probably\r\ngreasing the dirty works of Belgian brothels and gambling-hells,\r\nmight have secured the philosopher nearly three weeks’ leisure\r\nfrom his school-teaching for the contemplation of the Monistic\r\nEssence, and but for his sense of family duty his son could not have\r\nsquandered it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE END OF MAN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OFFERINGS TO THE DEAD.\r\n\r\n  [_Face p. 108._\r\n]\r\n\r\nBut among the common multitudes of the city, the dry light of this\r\nphilosophic spirit is not conspicuous. It has never arisen, and the\r\nreligious fervour of their existence remains misty, dark, and warm.\r\nRelics of far older beliefs mingle with their Hinduism. In one of\r\ntheir burning-grounds I met a little procession carrying milk in\r\nbrazen bowls to wash the bones of the dead burnt yesterday, and to\r\npour an offering for the spirit’s consolation. Round another grave a\r\ngroup of mourners were seated, offering yellow flowers, and pouring\r\nwater on the dust that was alive last week. Two of them beat cymbals,\r\nand at long intervals a man raised a large white conch-shell to\r\nhis lips and blew a melancholy note. Why will not the dead listen\r\nwhen they are called? Why will they not give one word of answer to\r\ntrumpet, prayers, and love? And all the while, one of the mourners,\r\nregardless of the world, swayed to and fro chanting the undying\r\ntruth that man must die, for life is a shadow, and he vanishes;\r\nthose who stand beside a grave know this truth undying; they know\r\nthat they too shall vanish like a shade, yet they go back to the\r\ncity and sin, and sin again, forgetting that they too shall vanish\r\nlike a shade. So the lamentation went on, the water was poured, the\r\nmilk was offered, the conch-shell sounded its last vain summons, and\r\nthe living returned to their life of numbered days. In the middle\r\nof Africa I have witnessed a yearning ceremonial exactly the same.\r\nIt was the same that brought Electra out to Agamemnon’s tomb. It is\r\nthe same that one may still see on All Saints’ Day, in any primitive\r\nregion of Europe, and in the cemeteries of Paris herself. For it\r\nsprings from the common longing of all mankind not to be forgotten,\r\nand, if only it were possible, never to forget. The same truth has\r\nbeen beautifully expressed with regard to the Bulgarian villagers of\r\nMacedonia by Mr. Brailsford in his book upon that country:—\r\n\r\n  “The real religion of the Balkans is older and more elemental than\r\n  Christianity itself; more permanent even than the Byzantine rite.\r\n  It bridges the intervening centuries and links in pious succession\r\n  the modern peasant to his heathen ancestor, who wore the same\r\n  costumes and led the same life in the same fields. It is based on a\r\n  primitive sorrow before the amazing fact of death, which no mystery\r\n  of the Resurrection has ever softened. It is neither a rite nor a\r\n  creed, but only that yearning love of the living for the dead which\r\n  is deeper than any creed.”[30]\r\n\r\nIn the service of the living, the fervent religious spirit of the\r\nSouth takes other forms, some of adoration, some only ritualistic.\r\nNow and then it turns to practical utility—the hope that religion\r\nwill bring some temporal good to the worshipper. There is a belief\r\nalmost universal, I suppose, in our own country and in Europe\r\nthat religious thoughts, prayers, and observances ensure outward\r\nwell-being, health, protection, or prosperity of some kind. In the\r\nEast it is probably not so common, for religion is there elevated to\r\nits proper sphere of the inmost soul, where the comforts and external\r\nadvantages of life disappear into insignificance compared with the\r\nglory that is revealed. But, deeply religious as the Hindu mind can\r\nbe, I found the people in the streets of Madras directing religious\r\necstasy to the rather trivial object of healing disease, much as\r\nthough they had been mere Faith-healers or Christian Scientists.\r\nThe festival of Shiva lasted three or four days, and at any hour of\r\nthe burning sunlight, one could meet little processions parading\r\nthrough Black Town with some sort of shrine or image, accompanied by\r\npipes and drums, dancing and praying crowds. The sick were caught up\r\nfrom the doors into the pious orgies and with holy revelry danced\r\nthemselves into a state of ecstatic self-forgetfulness which was\r\nunquestionably wholesome. Few diseases, I think, could stand against\r\nsuch treatment, provided only that the patient survived. It might\r\nbe tried with miraculous results in the streets of our bath-chair\r\nwatering-places. But if the triumph and proof of religion depended on\r\nmere miracles of healing the sick and raising the dead, it would be a\r\npity to waste a minute’s thought upon the subject.\r\n\r\nFar more fruitful was the unmixed and disinterested adoration that\r\nthronged the temples in the evening. One night I found myself at a\r\nbeautiful temple in the southern part of the town. It is a Vishnu\r\ntemple: here is his tank, here his chariot. But the people there\r\nwere celebrating the festival of Shiva all the same, and among the\r\ndeep orange columns of the external portico, dim figures in white or\r\nIndian red moved silently about, hardly revealed in the purple night\r\nby rare lanterns and tiny lamps. Being accompanied by a Brahman who\r\nwas guardian of the temple, I was admitted through brazen doors into\r\na vast courtyard leading up to the inner shrine on which no alien\r\nmay look. Here the worshippers stood in an almost continuous crowd,\r\nsilent, slowly moving in dubious obscurity. I caught one gleam of\r\nyellow light on prostrate forms among columns beyond, but a priest\r\nled me quietly into a vast chamber at the side, where were stabled\r\nthe mystic figures of a dragon large as life, a flying kite and an\r\nelephant, all awaiting the great day when the god takes to his car\r\nand moves in glory through the streets, seated beneath the mystic\r\ntree, which also was standing there. From a hidden and cavernous safe\r\nthe priest then displayed a flashing wealth of emeralds and rubies,\r\nunnumbered as the Milky Way and, possibly, surpassing their own value\r\nby their holiness. Disappearing for a while, after shutting the safe,\r\nhe returned with a pink garland, thick as a liner’s hawser, and hung\r\nit round my neck, where already two white garlands hung, for I had\r\nbeen received with honour by a political club just before I came. But\r\nthis new pink garland nearly touched my feet. It had been an offering\r\nto the shrine, and came to me cold from the neck of the god himself.\r\n\r\nThus sanctified and adorned, I passed back into the throng of\r\nworshippers in the temple court, and presently felt among them a\r\npeculiar stir of excitement, which I naturally attributed to my\r\nunusual appearance, just visible in the darkness. But when I was\r\nconducted by the Brahman to a large private house overlooking the\r\nprecincts, for the first time in India I failed to receive the usual\r\nHindu welcome. The rooms and courtyards glimmered with little lamps.\r\nSeated in the verandah before the door, a band of pipers, blowing\r\nas they pleased, drove dull care away—far away, one hoped, for her\r\nsake. Gods, kites, and elephants of painted alabaster were arranged\r\nin neat rows upon the table of an inner room, and little girls,\r\ndressed in the gorgeous silks and embroideries of Southern India,\r\ntended them with lights and flowers. But the master of the house,\r\nhimself a temple guardian, politely expressed an unwillingness to\r\nreceive the foreigner, and when I turned back among the excited crowd\r\nthat swarmed round me under the temple colonnade, I heard for the\r\nfirst time the wild shout of “Bande Mataram! Bande Mataram!” (Hail\r\nto the Motherland!) rising on every side. If a Brahman had not been\r\nmy guide, I should have supposed the outcry to be due to religious\r\nindignation. He told me afterwards it was in compliment to my Liberal\r\nopinions. But I think it was not in compliment to my English clothes,\r\nwhich were far more conspicuous than my Liberal opinions.\r\n\r\nThere is no part of India where the anti-English feeling was less to\r\nbe expected than in Madras. Here the Hindu is seen at his mildest,\r\nhere he asks least of this fleeting world, and accepts destiny with\r\nthe gentlest quietude. If ever there was a country easy to govern,\r\nit should be Southern India; and in time past no part of India has\r\nsurrendered itself more unreservedly to British rule or trusted\r\nmore confidently to British justice. Much of this friendliness\r\nhas been due to the influence of our missionaries, represented by\r\nsome very remarkable men in Madras. I do not know their statistics\r\nof conversion: I think they must be very low, especially as the\r\nBishop of Madras, during my visit, was expressing his despair of\r\never converting educated Indians, and was urging his clergy to pay\r\nattention only to the lowest castes. But the missionary influence\r\nupon education itself has been very large. It has created one famous\r\nand excellent institution, and a popular restaurant besides. It is\r\nchiefly the cause, I suppose, of the widespread knowledge of English\r\namong all classes in the city. More than this, I found that in Madras\r\nand other parts of India, as I had seen in Nigeria, Central Africa,\r\nand South Africa—even in Macedonia and Armenia also—the missionaries\r\ndo maintain a certain standard of justice to the credit of the “White\r\nMan,” or “European,” and that the oppressed and destitute, even among\r\nthe classes below the protection of any caste, do actually turn to\r\nthem with the assurance of finding a quality of mercy and sympathetic\r\nunderstanding not very remote from their profession of brotherhood in\r\nChrist. It is easy to join in the taunt about “Famine Christians,”\r\nand to point to the curve of conversions varying directly with the\r\nprice of food. But if we were starving, I suppose most of us would\r\ngladly profess any religion in the world for a prospect of regular\r\nmeals, and the important thing is that by the missionaries no class\r\nis neglected or left to feel itself outcast from humanity—not even\r\nthe poor fishers on the sands south of the town, or the dwellers\r\nin savage huts that let at fourpence a month, and are sublet among\r\ndifferent families.\r\n\r\nMissionaries have done much, and so has a succession of good\r\ngovernors, from the time of Sir Thomas Munro, to whose memory the\r\ntemple bell still rings a special chime before service. Our own\r\npeople have forgotten him for three generations now, but I have\r\nseen the Hindu women drop their baskets and bow their heads as they\r\npassed his equestrian statue on “the Island”—an honour seldom paid\r\nto equestrian statues at home. He it was who reduced the taxes and\r\nwatered the land and executed justice; and so his memory lives.\r\nTaught by his example, the people used to recognize that there were\r\nsome things we English could do: we could organize drainage, and\r\nbuild bridges to stand, and decide quarrels without taking bribes.\r\nSo they were content to leave these comparatively unimportant\r\nconcerns in our hands, while they devoted themselves to the only two\r\noccupations that matter much—the growth of food and the worship of\r\nGod. If their faith in our peculiar powers is declining, and they are\r\nthemselves making new claims upon government and public life, the\r\nchange is due to underlying causes, which are affecting the whole of\r\nIndia in varying degrees, and have already produced a new sense of\r\nunity in opposition.\r\n\r\nUnhappily, the grievance of Anglo-Indian manners is not peculiar\r\nto Madras. The attitude of the vulgar among Anglo-Indians towards\r\nthe people of the country would be incredible to any one who had\r\nnot seen it, and the vulgar are a large and increasing class. They\r\nincrease by a kind of infection, and the deterioration of a new-comer\r\nwho has been sent out with the usual instincts of our educated\r\nclasses in favour of politeness and decency, is often as unconscious\r\nas it is rapid. The pressure of his social surroundings is almost\r\nirresistible. If he does not wish to cut himself off altogether from\r\nthe society and amusements of his own people, he will be driven to\r\nconform to the code of insolence established among them. To stand\r\nalone against feminine dislike and masculine views of good-form\r\nrequires a toughness of character and an indifference to personal\r\nreputation or advancement which one cannot expect from many of the\r\nyoung Englishmen and Englishwomen who come out. These usually spring\r\nfrom a caste bred upon rather rigid observances, and they look to\r\nthe opinion of their own caste almost entirely for the sanction of\r\nconduct. At first they are astonished that Anglo-Indian opinion not\r\nonly permits but imposes so ill-bred a manner in intercourse with\r\n“natives,” but the astonishment soon wears off, and the infection\r\nof arrogance catches them as a matter of course. The Governor of\r\nBombay once told me it was impossible to convert “bounders” into\r\ngentlemen by Act of Parliament, and, unfortunately, that is true;\r\nelse we might enjoy a more enviable reputation in the world. But I\r\nwas astonished to find how easily an apparent gentleman may become\r\nentirely the opposite if he finds himself set up as one of a superior\r\nrace among a polite and gentle people, always too much inclined to\r\nsubmit to rudeness with reverential astonishment.\r\n\r\nDr. Lefroy, the Bishop of Lahore, who for a quarter of a century\r\nhas striven with constancy and some success to restore the higher\r\ntradition of our race, has said that, but for railways, all might\r\nbe well. And it is quite true that the commonest and most flagrant\r\ninstances of Anglo-Indian vulgarity are to be found in trains. But\r\nthat is chiefly because it is most often in trains that the two races\r\nmeet on terms of nominal equality. On almost every railway journey\r\none sees instances of ill-manners that would appear too outrageous\r\nfor belief at home. But it is the same throughout. In hotels,\r\nclubs, bungalows, and official chambers, the people of the country,\r\nand especially the educated classes, are treated with an habitual\r\ncontumely more exasperating than savage persecution. I gladly admit\r\nthat in every part of India I found Englishmen who still retained the\r\ncourtesy and sensitiveness of ordinary good manners. But one’s mere\r\ndelight in finding them proved their rarity. Anglo-Indians tell us\r\nconstantly that our first thought must be to maintain our national\r\nprestige, and if arrogance will do it, our prestige is safe. But when\r\nI watched the Anglo-Indian behaviour towards Indians themselves, I\r\noften wondered whether prestige is really to be secured by manners\r\nsuch as we should hardly find among “bounders” at home. For myself,\r\nI should have thought Lord Morley was right when he said that “bad\r\nmanners, overbearing manners, are very disagreeable in all countries,\r\nbut India is the only country where bad and overbearing manners are a\r\npolitical crime.”[31]\r\n\r\nUnhappily, the justice of Indian complaints on this subject was not\r\nnew to me, when I came to Madras. Every one finds proofs of it from\r\nthe moment of landing in Bombay, and, in fact, even on board ship.\r\nThe social estrangement between the two races rapidly increases\r\nafter Port Said is left. But in Madras I found another cause of deep\r\ndissatisfaction. In spite of all I had heard about injustice in\r\nparticular cases, in spite of the old demand for police reform and\r\nthe separation of the judicial and executive functions now combined\r\nin the District Magistrate, it was disconcerting to discover a\r\nprevailing and uneasy suspicion that British justice could not safely\r\nbe trusted. Certainly, much disquietude had recently been roused\r\nby a few special instances, at Rawal Pindi, Lahore, and elsewhere.\r\n“Killing no murder, outrage no crime, when Indians are concerned and\r\nEnglishmen the culprits”: that was the common conclusion, and it was\r\nnot unnatural.\r\n\r\nBut the suspicion arose from more general and permanent causes\r\nas well. There remains the standing sense of wrong, because an\r\nEnglishman has the right to a different form of trial from an\r\nIndian. A magistrate with power to inflict a two years’ sentence\r\non an Indian, may inflict only six months on a European. No Indian\r\nmay try a criminal case against a European, and in criminal cases a\r\nEuropean may claim a jury, with a majority of Europeans on it. Lord\r\nRipon’s attempt gradually to modify these distinctions is one of the\r\nwell-remembered events of his famous Viceroyalty—one of the many\r\nreasons which have endeared his name to India as no other Viceroy’s\r\nis endeared—but his endeavour was thwarted.\r\n\r\nAs to the separation of functions, the Viceroy’s Council, through Sir\r\nHarvey Adamson, has lately (March, 1908) promised an experiment with\r\nthis purpose in Eastern Bengal; but in India generally the District\r\nMagistrate who tries cases himself, or arranges for their trial by\r\nhis subordinates, also controls the police, and in nearly all cases\r\nthe police bring the charge. The injustice of this arrangement, with\r\nall its opportunities for official influence on legal decisions, has\r\nlong been so obvious that one would have thought the cost of the\r\nchange was the only obstacle to it. But while I did not hear much\r\nabout the danger of increased cost, I heard a great deal about the\r\ndanger of diminished dignity, if the District Magistrate lost either\r\nhalf of his functions. After a battle of over half a century, we may\r\nhope, however, that this grievance is now to disappear.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I found that the old scandals about the police had\r\nsurvived Sir Andrew Fraser’s commission of inquiry (1902). Promotion\r\nstill went in practice by the number of convictions obtained, and\r\nconvictions too often depended on evidence derived by the police\r\nfrom the accused themselves—so-called “confessions,” extorted by\r\nmeans which, rightly or wrongly, were spoken of with horror among\r\nthe people, and even among Anglo-Indians. Between his arrest and\r\nhis sentence the prisoner was left in the hands of the police, and\r\nat their mercy, thus giving them the opportunity of compelling him\r\nto give evidence to his own detriment. Wherever I went in India I\r\nheard the same complaint of the unscrupulousness and corruption of\r\nthe police. Some of the British police officers with whom I became\r\nintimate, appeared to be experienced and sympathetic men, struggling\r\nrather hopefully on the side of reform. But the pay of the ordinary\r\nnative policeman is so ludicrously small (from 8_s._ to 10_s._ a\r\nmonth), even when the low scale of wages in India is considered,\r\nthat the constant temptation to extortion can hardly be resisted,\r\nespecially among a population so indifferent to this world and so\r\ndeferential to authority, that even the innocent will volunteer\r\nbribes in hopes of being left in peace.\r\n\r\nThe drink question in Madras is much the same as in the rest of\r\nIndia. In a sense, it is worse even than in England, for we see one\r\nof the most temperate and frugal populations of the world gradually\r\ntaking to drink as a new habit.[32] The increase of drink is largely\r\ndue to education, largely to the example of Europeans and of Indians\r\nlately returned from Europe; partly, in Madras at all events, to\r\nChristianized Indians who claim the right of casting off all the old\r\nrestrictions of Indian behaviour. As in England, the Government does\r\nnot escape its share of blame, owing to the large revenue derived\r\nfrom the drink trade. The Excise or “Abkari” Department sells the\r\nlicences by auction, the bidding is keen, and it is difficult to\r\nprevent the purchaser of a licence from setting up business in the\r\nmost lucrative position he can find. By a series of resolutions\r\nin February, 1890, the Government of India declared its intention\r\nof reducing the drink traffic, especially by the restriction of\r\nshops. Nevertheless, the traffic has very largely increased, and\r\nif the number of shops has not increased in proportion, they have\r\nbeen opened near market places, bathing ghats, schools, hospitals,\r\ntemples, factories, and other places of common resort, where, as Sir\r\nFrederic Lely has said, they serve as “veritable traps to catch the\r\nweak, the thirsty, and the tired.”\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to define how far the most paternal of Governments\r\nis responsible for the excesses of its children, to whom it refuses\r\nthe common rights of grown men. The evils of the drink traffic in\r\nIndia were not to be compared with the evils I had seen in West and\r\nCentral Africa, nor were they so pronounced in Madras as in Calcutta.\r\nBut the growth of the drinking habit—mainly European in origin—must\r\nbe added to the other more prominent causes of unrest, even among a\r\npopulation so peaceful and backward as Madras is considered to be in\r\ncomparison with Poona. Hatred of drink as something equally deadly\r\nand foreign was one of the causes why the Swadeshi movement, starting\r\nfrom Eastern Bengal, had spread in less than two years throughout the\r\nwhole country. Of that movement I had already seen many evidences.\r\nIn Bombay I had seen the Indian cotton-mills working against time to\r\nmeet the demand for _saris_ and _dhotis_ (women’s and men’s cloths)\r\nfree from the taint of foreign profit. And now in Madras I found the\r\nSwadeshi movement very strong. “None but Swadeshi goods,” “Buy our\r\nNationalist cottons,” “Try our Bande Mataram cigarettes,” were the\r\nmost telling advertisements a shop could write up or insert in the\r\nnative newspapers, which are particularly strong and excellent in\r\nMadras.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DANCE OF HIGH CASTE GIRLS IN MADRAS.\r\n\r\n  [_Face p. 122._\r\n]\r\n\r\nOne wealthy Hindu had ventured even in manufacture to follow the\r\nextreme party which said: “Let the English go their way. We will ask\r\nno share in their government and take none. We will neither appeal\r\nto their law courts nor accept salaries as their officials. We must\r\npay their taxes, but otherwise we will forget that these foreigners\r\nare among us at all.” He had determined to set up a cotton works\r\nwithout the aid even of imported machinery. Collecting members of\r\nthe old weaving caste, he erected a bamboo factory of hand-looms,\r\nwhere they were turning out the beautiful fabrics of Indian work,\r\nlittle more expensive than the English machine-made stuffs and four\r\ntimes as durable. The experiment is exposed to some of the dangers of\r\nconscious revivals—the dangers of “Arts and Crafts.” But hand-loom\r\nweaving still retains a quite natural life in many parts of India,\r\nin spite of the British manufacturers’ long endeavours to kill the\r\nIndian weaving industry. When I visited his simple factory among the\r\npalms north of Madras, he told me he could not keep pace with the\r\ndemands of the Hindu women. And if the women who buy cotton cloth for\r\ntheir _saris_ and children’s bits of clothing are willing to give a\r\nfew farthings more for native and national work, in a district where\r\nthey have to toil all day for a wage of twopence, it shows that\r\nthe national spirit, even in philosophic and devotional Madras, is\r\nreaching far beyond the limits of the class that our own most highly\r\neducated classes taunt and sneer at as “educated Indians.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[30] “Macedonia,” by H. N. Brailsford, p. 75.\r\n\r\n[31] Speech at Arbroath, October 21, 1907.\r\n\r\n[32] This increase is probably shown in the rapid increase of the\r\nExcise Revenue, which rose from £3,742,800 in 1897 to £5,687,820 in\r\n1906. Of the latter sum “country spirits” yielded nearly £3,000,000,\r\nand “toddy” (the popular drink made from the toddy palm), £874,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nON THE BEACH\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was evening, and the sky was full of the deep and ominous colours\r\nof an Indian sunset in the rains. A hot wind blowing in from the\r\nsea threw the waves in heavy surf upon the sand. Up and down the\r\nlong “Marina,” or esplanade, bordered by a few vast public offices\r\nand a few fishermen’s hovels, the last carriages were bearing home\r\nAnglo-Indian ladies or youths comfortably wearied with their polo\r\nand other games. But on the broad, dry sand, between the esplanade\r\nand the surf, a vast circle of people was gathered round a little\r\nplatform and chair. They were seated by hundreds on the sand—between\r\nfour and five thousand of them altogether—and round the outer edge of\r\nthe seated circle hundreds more were standing upright, like the rim\r\nof a flat plate.\r\n\r\nWhen the meeting began their dark and eager faces could still be seen\r\nin the sunset light. The faces disappeared, and only the brilliant\r\nwhite turbans and white draperies were visible by the flicker of\r\na big lamp they had fitted upon the platform. The waning moon rose\r\nlate and shapeless among heavy clouds, and the dark faces reappeared,\r\noutlined in silver; but still the crowd sat on.\r\n\r\nAll were men, and most of them were young. They had assembled to\r\nshow their joy at the release of Ajit Singh and Lajpat Rai—both\r\ninhabitants of the far-off Punjab, one till lately an unknown youth,\r\nthe other till lately hardly known to any one in Madras, and only\r\nknown anywhere as a reformer of Hindu superstitions, a man of austere\r\nprivate life and inexhaustible liberality to his own people.[33] Now\r\nboth had been raised by their deportation and imprisonment without\r\ntrial to the position of heroes and martyrs, and their recent release\r\n(Nov. 11, 1907) had been greeted with joy throughout the country,\r\nthough not with gratitude; for there is no great cause for gratitude\r\nwhen a wrong-doer undoes the wrong.\r\n\r\nThrough the middle of the crowd came a line of white-robed students\r\ncarrying a yellow banner with a strange device. “Bande Mataram!\r\nBande Mataram! Hail to the Motherland! we bow before our mother!”\r\nrose the familiar cry from the thousands seated there. But there was\r\nno wild gesticulation, no frantic excess, such as we might imagine\r\nin a fanatical East. A Trafalgar Square crowd is more demonstrative\r\nand unrestrained. Nor was a single soldier or policeman visible,\r\nthough the occasion had been publicly announced as a meeting of the\r\nExtremists. In the audience I was of course the only European present.\r\n\r\nA little boy with head half shaven and a long tuft of black hair at\r\nthe back stood up before the platform, and amid complete silence sang\r\nin his native Tamil the Bengali song of “Bande Mataram,” which has\r\nnow become the national song of India. The music is of that queer\r\nEastern kind, nasal, quavering, full of turns and twists, such as\r\none may hear from the Adriatic to Burma, and very likely beyond. In\r\norigin I believe it to be Persian; at all events I have heard it\r\nin highest perfection on the Persian frontier and sung by Persian\r\nmusicians. Usually—in Greek for instance—the words are rendered\r\ndifficult to distinguish owing to the twists and long-drawn phrases,\r\nbut in this boy’s singing the words were fairly distinct, and the\r\nrepeated cadence gave a certain solemnity.\r\n\r\nThe words of the song were by a Bengali poet, Bankim Chandra\r\nChatterji, who introduced it into his historic novel called\r\n“Anandamath,” or “The Abbey of Joy,” a romance upon the rebellion\r\nof the austere Sanyasi Order against the decaying rule of the\r\nMohammedans in Eastern Bengal when Warren Hastings was the real\r\npower. The best-known translation is by Mr. W. H. Lee, late of\r\nthe Indian Civil Service. It is fairly close, but English cannot\r\nreproduce the compression of the original Sanscrit and Bengali mixed:—\r\n\r\n    “My Motherland, I sing\r\n     Her splendid streams, her glorious trees,\r\n     The zephyr from the far-off Vindyan heights,\r\n     Her fields of waving corn,\r\n     The rapturous radiance of her moonlit nights,\r\n     The trees in flower that flame afar,\r\n     The smiling days that sweetly vocal are,\r\n     The happy, blessed Motherland.\r\n     Her will by seventy million throats extolled,\r\n     Her power twice seventy million arms uphold;\r\n     Her strength let no man scorn.\r\n     Thou art my head, thou art my heart,\r\n     My life and soul art thou,\r\n     My song, my worship, and my art,\r\n     Before thy feet I bow.\r\n     As Durga, scourge of all thy foes,\r\n     As Lakshmi, bowered in the flower,\r\n     That in the water grows,\r\n     As Bani, wisdom, power;\r\n     The source of all our might,\r\n     Our every temple doth thy form unfold—\r\n     Unequalled, tender, happy, pure,\r\n     Of splendid streams, of glorious trees,\r\n     My Motherland I sing,\r\n     The stainless charm that shall endure,\r\n     And verdant banks and wholesome breeze,\r\n     That with her praises ring.”\r\n\r\nIt is obviously too tender for a stirring “Marseillaise.” There is\r\nnot enough march and thunder either in words or tune to enflame the\r\nsoul of trampling hosts. The thunder comes in the cry of “Bande\r\nMataram!” But the tenderness, the devoted love of country, and the\r\nadoration of motherhood are all characteristic of the Indian mind.\r\n\r\nWhen this national anthem was finished, the Tamil poet of Madras\r\nrecited a lament he had written for Lajpat Rai at the time of his\r\ndeportation. It was the common lament of exiles—the fond memory of\r\nhome, the deep attachment to the land of childhood, the loneliness\r\nof life among strangers and unknown tongues—all very quietly and\r\nsimply told. Then by a sudden change, the poet turned to satire,\r\nand described a dialogue between Mr. John Morley and India, on the\r\nsubject of Swaraj or Home Rule:—\r\n\r\n  “You are disunited,” says Mr. Morley; “what have you to do with\r\n  Home Rule? You don’t speak the same language, you haven’t got the\r\n  same religion; what have you to do with Home Rule? You cannot\r\n  fight, you are too fond of law, you are the victims of education;\r\n  what have you to do with Home Rule? You are born slaves, you\r\n  prostrate yourselves before the Englishman: what have you to do\r\n  with Home Rule? You are seditious, you are a prairie on fire, you\r\n  are a barrel of gunpowder, you cry for the moon, you are not fit\r\n  for a fur coat; what have you to do with Home Rule?”[34]\r\n\r\nTo which India makes firm and dignified reply. She has tasted\r\nfreedom, she has learnt from England herself what freedom is; even\r\nJohn Morley has been her teacher, and she will not cease to labour\r\nfor Swaraj. Having drunk the nectar of freedom, can she turn back to\r\nthe palm-tree “toddy” of a Government shop, or cease to labour for\r\nSwaraj? She claims the right of other nations, the rights for which\r\nEngland herself has fought; she claims the same freedom of person and\r\nof speech, and she will not cease to labour for Swaraj. From north to\r\nsouth her people are becoming united, from east to west the cry of\r\n“Bande Mataram” goes up, and slowly the sun of freedom is arising: it\r\nmay rise slowly, but India will not cease to labour for Swaraj.\r\n\r\nThe chairman rose, and the darkening air glimmered with the petals of\r\nflowers thrown in handfuls, as the custom is. Round his neck heavy\r\ngarlands were hung, pink and white, to match the lesser garlands\r\nwhich surrounded the photographs of the two national heroes on the\r\ntable. He spoke in English, like all the subsequent speakers till\r\nthe last. One felt at once how great a contribution to Indian unity\r\nthe English rule makes in the gift of a common language which all\r\neducated men can understand, while even in Madras alone four distinct\r\nnative languages are spoken. He summarized the history of the last\r\nyear of suspicion, repression, deportation, imprisonment, flogging of\r\nboys and students for political causes, and the Seditious Meetings\r\nAct. It was all done without passion or exaggeration, and he ended\r\nwith a simple resolution calling on the Government to repeal the\r\ndeportation statute as contrary to the rights which England had\r\nsecured for herself under the _Habeas Corpus_.\r\n\r\nFour speakers supported the resolution, and all spoke with the\r\nsame quiet reasonableness, so different from our conception of the\r\nOriental mind. But for clapping of hands, and occasional shouts\r\nof “Bande Mataram!” or “Jai!” (literally “Victory!” or “Long live\r\nSo-and-so!”), the immense crowd remained equally calm. There was\r\nno frenzy, no disorder, no excitement, beyond intense interest and\r\ndesire to leave no word unheard. If a speaker was just a shade too\r\nemotional the crowd laughed a little scornfully, just as an English\r\ncrowd does. They laughed when one speaker—a well-known writer and\r\njournalist of Madras—just overstepped the limits in recalling,\r\nwith tears in his voice, those happy days when as a student he had\r\nsucked the enthusiasm for freedom from John Morley’s own books,\r\nand had learnt to regard him as one of the gods of literature and\r\nliberty, in the same great pantheon with Mill and Burke and Milton.\r\nThe crowd knew the man was in earnest, and they applauded, but they\r\nlaughed just a little scornfully. For the rest, the speaking was\r\naverage straightforward stuff, free from flowers, and even free from\r\nquotations, which are the besetting tendency of many Indian minds.\r\nIndeed, I remember only one quotation—just a hint at a parody on\r\nMark Antony’s speech, with John Morley and the Liberal Government as\r\nthe honourable men.\r\n\r\nOnly Anglo-Indians could have called the speeches seditious. To a\r\ncommon type of Anglo-Indian mind any criticism of the Government, any\r\nclaim to further freedom, is sedition. But though this was avowedly\r\na meeting of Extremists, the claim in the speeches was for the\r\nsimple human rights that other peoples enjoy—the right to a voice\r\nin their own affairs, and in the spending of their own money. As\r\nto the increased suppression and persecution now overhanging them,\r\nthey might well be driven to despair. Other grievances they had long\r\nknown, and ever since Lord Curzon came to India their complaints\r\nhad been augmented. But they had always kept a belief in England’s\r\nrespect for personal rights and freedom, till Mr. Morley, of all\r\nstatesmen, came to overthrow it. What was left to hope for now?\r\n\r\nSo the meeting went on, till four speakers had spoken long, and\r\nthe late moon was moving up among the clouds and stars. Then a new\r\nspeaker rose—tall, dark, and aged, with clearly cut features, and a\r\nshaven head. His dress was of deep salmon-coloured cotton—saffron,\r\nwith a tinge of red—and in one hand he held a wanderer’s staff,\r\nsymbolic of control over thought, speech, and action. Once he had\r\nbeen a rich man, a barrister, a councillor, a leader of public life.\r\nNow he had given away all he possessed. He had discarded the mark\r\nof worship and the sacred thread. Having said farewell to family\r\nand friends, to business, politics, and all transitory things, he\r\nhad set off with only a staff to wander through India, begging his\r\nbread and teaching the divine realities, on which he meditated\r\nday and night. To this meeting he had come, not to discuss mortal\r\njustice or the British rule—things that hardly throw a shadow on\r\nthe radiance of eternity—but only to say that in his wanderings he\r\nhad met with Lajpat Rai, and had found in him a saintly human soul,\r\nsimple-hearted, austere, and regardless of possessions. He spoke in\r\nhis childhood’s Tamil, and when he had finished speaking he went upon\r\nhis way, while the meeting dispersed, and dying shouts of “Bande\r\nMataram!” mingled with the roaring of the surf.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[33] Introduction, p. 20.\r\n\r\n[34] See Introduction, p. 26 ff., Mr. Morley’s speech at Arbroath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE FLOODS OF ORISSA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe holy region of Orissa, where stand the temples of Juggernath,\r\n“Lord of the World,” and of Tribhuvaneshwar, less famous but “Lord\r\nof Three Worlds” all the same, needs what wealth of holiness it has\r\ngot, for its earthly fortunes are small. The ancient Uriya people\r\nlive there, speaking a strange and separate language, though it is\r\nsaid to be near akin to an ancient Sanscrit form, and using a script\r\nlike wire netting or a series of circles in a row. In the southern\r\ndistrict near Ganjam they are still counted as part of the Madras\r\nPresidency, but all the rest of their country is now limited to\r\nBengal, and its officials are responsible to the Lieutenant-Governor\r\nin Calcutta. The greater part of the land is held by Tributary\r\nChiefs and Rajahs, under the control of a Political Agent, but a\r\ngood deal is owned by ordinary zemindars or landlords who sublet\r\nto peasants much in the usual way, come under the authority of the\r\nusual Commissioners and Collectors of the Civil Service, and about\r\ntwo-thirds of them pay a land-tax or rent to Government, nominally\r\nfixed every thirty years, because they are not included in the\r\nPermanent Settlement of Bengal. There are also a few cultivators\r\nholding direct from Government.\r\n\r\nSo far the peasants of Orissa are not worse off than other people\r\nwho have to live at the mercy of landowners. Their special hardship\r\ncomes from the nature of the country and from “visitations of God,”\r\nas they are called; though why God’s visitations are regarded only\r\nas evil it is difficult to understand. Looking inland from the\r\ncoast, one can see the beginning of mountain ranges running far into\r\nthe interior, and it is there that the Tributary Chiefs and Rajahs\r\nhave their territories, there that hill-tribes live, and wandering\r\nelephants abound. But between the mountains and the sea lies a broad\r\nbelt of alluvial plain. It is under British control, but permeated\r\nby uncertain and changeable rivers that issue like wild animals\r\nfrom the mountains and refuse control of any kind. Such rivers are\r\nthe Byturni, a sacred stream, where millions of pilgrims bathe on\r\ntheir way down the Grand Trunk Road to the shrine of Juggernath; the\r\nBrahmani, also sacred as its name denotes, but the chief cause of the\r\npresent profane disasters; and the Mahanadi, which threatens the old\r\ncapital city of Cuttack, and is sometimes a desert of sand, sometimes\r\na sea.\r\n\r\nIn August rain had fallen on the mountains for fifteen days and\r\nnights without ceasing. Foot by foot the water in the sacred rivers\r\nrose. The islands disappeared, the broad miles of sand disappeared,\r\nthe water reached the edge of the steep mud banks. Forty years before\r\nit had done the same, and old people began to awake their appalling\r\nmemories. At a point called Janardan Ghai, not far from Jenapur, upon\r\nthe Brahmani, the embankment had then given way. The breach had never\r\nbeen properly repaired; only lately a rubble “bund” or break-water\r\nhad been constructed, and now on August 20th, in the middle of the\r\nnight, it gave way again. In a dark torrent, bearing sand and stones\r\nwith it, the irresistible river streamed over all the lower lands\r\naround, covering the crops and melting the mud villages away like\r\nant-heaps. The land is flat, but in the confusion and darkness the\r\npeople crowded up any little slope for safety, or climbed into trees;\r\nand one woman had her baby born as she supported herself among the\r\nbranches. When morning came, eight feet of turbulent water lay over\r\ntheir homes and crops. In November I could still trace the tidemark\r\nof the flood by tufts of dried grass and drift-wood sticking in the\r\ntrees high above my head, as you may do in early summer on the banks\r\nof the Severn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HUNGER.\r\n\r\n  [_Face p. 136._\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhen I reached Orissa, the first sign I saw of the calamity was a\r\nband of thirty or forty brown skeletons crawling towards me as I\r\nstood in a garden at Cuttack. They said they had walked from their\r\nruined homes beside the Brahmani, looking for work or food, and\r\nhundreds were wandering over the country in the same way, even as\r\nfar as Calcutta, which they counted a fortnight’s walk from there.\r\nProbably they had heard of my arrival, and collected in the vague\r\nhope of some kind of assistance, or perhaps simply from the instinct\r\nthat makes most people fling their misery before any human being for\r\nsympathy. Very likely some were habitual beggars, worn thin by man’s\r\nwant of charity, and taking the advantage of extra numbers to impress\r\nme. A man of stone would have been impressed. There is no need to\r\ndescribe a brown skeleton—the projecting ribs and spiny backbone, the\r\nlegs and arms like withered sticks, the deep pits at the collarbones,\r\nthe loose and crinkly skin. But when a party of brown skeletons fling\r\nthemselves flat on the ground before you, with arms outstretched\r\nbeyond their heads and faces rubbing in the dust, when they take your\r\nfeet in their bones and lay their skulls upon your boots, what are\r\nyou to do? What are you to do when there are fifteen hundred men,\r\nwomen, and children only waiting to catch sight of you that they may\r\nmake the same irresistible and hopeless appeal?\r\n\r\nI went to the officials. The Collector, under whose immediate charge\r\nthe problem of relief came, was away, but I had a long interview with\r\nthe Commissioner in his beautiful home, built on an ancient stone\r\nembankment that protects the town from the river, then hardly visible\r\nin the wide expanse of sand. In the case of both officials I observed\r\nthe same difficulties that I found in official life wherever I came\r\nacross it in India. Both I believe to have been entirely honourable\r\nand conscientious men, devoted to their rather monotonous but\r\nresponsible work, from which they could gain no great glory beyond\r\nthe usual steps of promotion, ending in retirement to the obscurity\r\nof some English golf-links. One of them, as I heard afterwards,\r\nhad a high reputation among his colleagues in the Service for his\r\nsolicitude on behalf of the people under his charge. He studied\r\ntheir language and customs with enthusiasm, and on one occasion had\r\ndisplayed conspicuous gallantry in defending them from a gang of\r\npillaging outlaws, whom he captured single-handed. Yet he was not\r\nthe more popular of the two; and though both were, I think, rather\r\nexceptional public servants, they were regarded with more hostility\r\nthan veneration. The curse of ordinary officials is that reform\r\nmeans change, and change means trouble. But a conscientious official\r\nhas the further curse that, under the constant pressure of work, he\r\nis compelled to spend most of his time among papers, statistics,\r\nand abstractions. To preserve his sanity under these conditions,\r\nthe Indian official is forced to the Club, where he can relax his\r\nmind among his own people, speak his own language, and follow the\r\npursuits that really interest our race, and so, little by little,\r\nthe people of the country, for whose sake alone he is supposed to be\r\nthere, appear to him only under the form of cases or numbers—inhuman\r\nsubjects, to be avoided in polite conversation.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner, from among his barricades of reports, abstracts,\r\nand regulations, gave me the official figures of distress, as far as\r\nwas ascertained at the end of the third month after the disaster.\r\nThey showed an estimated area of 460 square miles affected by the\r\nflood, with a peasant population of over 300,000; also so many houses\r\nswept away, so much loss in cattle and horses, so many deaths from\r\ncholera after the flood (nearly 2000), and so many rupees already\r\ndistributed in relief. From what 1 saw and heard afterwards, I should\r\nput the numbers reduced to a skeleton condition at about 5 per cent.\r\nof the 300,000 population. That does not sound very much, but if you\r\nwork it out, it gives 15,000 brown skeletons close to the touch of\r\ndeath by hunger.\r\n\r\nFor myself, I cannot think in thousands. I trust economists and\r\nofficials to do that for me. But there was one phrase in the official\r\nstatement that appeared quite comprehensible even to me: it was,\r\n“Deaths from starvation, nil.” Nothing could well be more explicit,\r\nyet even that simple assertion began to look as elusive as other\r\neconomics when I went out into the villages and saw the bony corpses\r\nand was told the official cause of death is always some innocent and\r\nunavoidable sickness like cholera or “bowel complaint,” and that the\r\nofficial mind has a rooted objection to starvation.\r\n\r\nFirst I went up the line to a place called Balasore, and late at\r\nnight visited two Settlement Camps, where a revision of land-titles\r\nwas slowly going on, in view of the next great Settlement which was\r\nto take place in twenty years’ time. It was a recent idea of Sir\r\nAndrew Fraser, Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, who with Scottish\r\nprovidence aimed at thus reducing the work that would await his\r\nfourth successor in office for the year or two before the next\r\nSettlement came. It is true that the present revision would require\r\nfurther revisions before then, but that did not matter. With this\r\nlaudable object, Indian officials were seated in their tents, and\r\njust visible by lanterns a crowd of forty or fifty small holders from\r\nneighbouring villages were gathered round them, all clutching their\r\nprecious title-deeds to their bosoms. For six days they had been\r\nwaiting there from nine in the morning to eleven at night, just at\r\nthe time when harvest needed them most. An official told me it took\r\nabout a month to complete the revision in a circle of twenty-one\r\nvillages, and the work never stopped but for the rains. Outside\r\none tent an enterprising shopkeeper had opened a little store of\r\nplantains, rice, and cakes to feed the patient crowd. Some were\r\nlittle boys whose fathers had died, some represented widows. So under\r\nthe dispensation of Scottish providence they waited, and one can only\r\nhope that the officials of eighteen or nineteen years hence will\r\nthink of them kindly while enjoying the far-off interest of their\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MY ELEPHANT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A VILLAGE CROWD.\r\n\r\n  [_Face p. 140._\r\n]\r\n\r\nNext day I returned to Jenapur, and mounted a large elephant, which,\r\nsad to say, could heartily enjoy a daily meal that would keep any\r\nHindu in prime condition for six weeks. As upon a watch-tower, for\r\nthe next few days I passed up and down the long line of flat country\r\nthat had been flooded beside the Brahmani, sometimes crossing over\r\ninto the basin of the Kharsua, another of the uncertain rivers\r\nthat alternately save and devastate the land. Where it was not\r\ndevastated, the country was thickly cultivated in little fields\r\nof rice, pulse, and a kind of millet, and the numbers of planted\r\nmango-trees gave it much the same look as an elm-row part of Essex or\r\nthe Midlands. Throughout the district rice was certainly the staple\r\ncrop, because, though it is so risky and wants so much water, its\r\nyield is magnificent when it yields at all; and it was one of the\r\nironies of India that, while here the land had been ruined by the\r\ndeluge of rain, on the way up from Madras I passed through miles on\r\nmiles of rice fields where the crops stood dying of drought, or were\r\nalready cut as straw for thatch or as fodder for the sacred cow.\r\nEven here the drought had been so severe since the flood that the\r\ninferior crops of grain and pulse had failed and could not be used to\r\nalleviate the distress.\r\n\r\nBut in many of the villages that I visited neither flood nor drought\r\nwill matter for many years. Sand like the seashore had covered crops,\r\nand fields, and boundaries, and homes in one indistinguishable\r\ndesert. At the first village I came to after my elephant had waded\r\nthrough the numerous shallow channels into which the river had now\r\nsunk, a crowd of naked people—two or three hundred, I suppose—had\r\nassembled round a Government agent who was issuing little doles of\r\nrice. Similar doles had been issued soon after the disaster three\r\nmonths before, but otherwise the people had received nothing from\r\na fatherly Government, because rain was officially due, and they\r\nought officially to have lived on the subsidiary crops nurtured by\r\nthe rain. But the heavens did not comply with official expectations;\r\ncholera came instead, and now the people were dying, not, of course,\r\nfrom starvation, but from “bowel complaints.”\r\n\r\nAt sight of me upon the elephant, the people left their doles and\r\nflung themselves prostrate upon the hot sand which had ruined them.\r\nSome brought hoes, and digging three feet down, they showed a few\r\nwithered blades from what had once been a rice-field. To that\r\nthickness the sand lay over acres and miles of country along the\r\nlow land beside the river, and now on the top of the sand the hungry\r\nvillagers flung themselves flat in their appeal. Surely a man who\r\nrode an elephant and wore a helmet, and was white by courtesy, could\r\nsave them! What could I do? There were 15,000 living skeletons ready\r\nto join in that prayer, and I had one pocketful of coppers. Rice was\r\nselling at 1½_d._ a pound; it takes two pounds a day to feed a man\r\ndecently, and the full wage for a working cultivator was twopence in\r\nordinary times. Where is charity when things are like that? And where\r\nare economics?\r\n\r\nAs usual, it was the hangers-on to life who suffered most. Weavers\r\nare useful people, and the village weaver with his wooden hand-loom\r\ncan hardly be called a hanger-on in a land where every man and woman\r\nwears several yards of woven cotton, and washes the garment at least\r\nonce a day. But how can a weaver live unless women buy his stuff? And\r\nhow can a woman buy his stuff when she has just sold her doorposts\r\nand the family brass dish to buy food for her children, or to pay the\r\npolice tax for the protection of property? She makes her old rags\r\ndo, and the weaver starves. There were starving weavers in all the\r\nvillages, and some it seemed impossible to save even with the food\r\nrepresented by a gift of twopence.\r\n\r\nIt was the same with the landless labourers who worked under the\r\nryots for wages. It was the same with the village blind, the village\r\nidiots, and the lepers. No one could afford to employ labour now or\r\nto give alms. In one village a labourer had scooped a little hole in\r\nthe ground, and fitted a plantain leaf neatly into it as a bowl for\r\ngifts. But charity was as dry as the heavens, and no alms fell. I saw\r\nthe plantain leaf still vainly appealing, but the man had died of\r\nhunger. In another village they were carrying a body to the fire, and\r\nthey laid the poor, naked thing down for me to see. It was a woman’s\r\nbody, a labourer’s sister, shrivelled and spiky with hunger, like the\r\nskeleton of a starved cat found under the slates. In defence of her\r\nbrother, the labourer himself, I must say that he was dying of hunger\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\nThe village houses in this part of Orissa, as in most parts of\r\nIndia, are built of mud plastered on to a bamboo framework, with\r\nwooden doorposts and rafters. They are thatched with rice straw or\r\npalm branches. At the first rush of the flood, the houses dissolved\r\nlike children’s castles in the tide, and I saw flat and bare plots\r\nof land where they had stood. Even the houses that had escaped the\r\nwater were almost as bare, for the people had been obliged to sell\r\nthe scanty stock of furniture that Hindu villagers possess—brass pots\r\nand plates, a corn bin, cooking vessels, and perhaps a bed—in order\r\nto pay the rent which the zemindars or landlords continued to exact,\r\nthough I was told the officials had ordered a suspension.\r\n\r\nThe native official “tahsildars,” acting as village tax-collectors,\r\nhad also compelled them to sell everything they had, even to their\r\nwooden doorposts, as I said, for paying the “chaukidari” tax (or\r\n“tikut,” as they call it) which supports the village police. It is\r\na small tax, paid quarterly, and running from a halfpenny up to\r\n1_s._ 4_d._ a month per house, but the police pay used formerly to\r\nbe raised from special plots of land set apart in each village for\r\nthe purpose, and the imposition of a hut-tax for the purpose ten\r\nyears ago had always been regarded as a grievance. Nor does it matter\r\nwhether a tax is great or small when you have to sell the family\r\nplate, valued at eighteenpence, to pay it. Just before my journey\r\nthrough the country, this tax had also been officially remitted,\r\nbut it was collected up to a day or two previously, and was always\r\nmentioned by the people as one of their most irritating grievances.\r\nNo one loves a tax-collector, but in time of famine there is\r\nsomething particularly galling in selling one’s property to feed the\r\npolice for preserving it.\r\n\r\nIn Orissa itself and in Calcutta the British officials were being\r\nrather angrily criticized for negligence, but apart from the\r\nnecessary failure of a system which tries to administer welfare\r\nthrough foreign rulers who live completely isolated from the people,\r\nI do not think the officials were to blame. They had given a little\r\nrelief at first. When the rains that ought to have fallen did not\r\nfall, they gave a little more. They remitted a tax, and called on the\r\nzemindars to remit rent. They did not discourage a band of Indian\r\nvolunteers, some of whom belonged to a reforming Vedantic Order\r\nin Calcutta, from distributing private relief. Sir Andrew Fraser,\r\nLieut.-Governor of Bengal, who was then on progress through Orissa,\r\nand spent a day in the famine district, told me relief works were\r\njust going to be undertaken, and the Government expected to spend\r\nabout £20,000 on the business of keeping alive and starting again.\r\nHe probably knew as much about starvation in the abstract as any\r\nofficial could, for he was in control of the relief in the Central\r\nProvinces during the terrible famine of 1900.[35] The officials had\r\nalso made the usual advances, called “takavi” loans, to holders of\r\ntwo to ten acres for the purchase of new seed and stock upon the\r\nsecurity of their holding.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the violent personal attacks upon the officials\r\nappeared to arise chiefly from the habit of all peoples who are\r\ncompelled to submit to a fatherly despotism. Being themselves\r\nexcluded from a voice in their destiny, they turn savagely upon the\r\nGovernment whenever distress or disorder supervenes, and the only\r\nreal hope I could see in the situation was the appearance of the\r\nlittle bands of volunteers who in true Swadeshi spirit were spreading\r\nthe conception of self-reliance throughout India. Sir Andrew Fraser\r\nand the higher officials welcomed their efforts, but the average\r\nAnglo-Indians and the journalists of Calcutta either treated them\r\nwith contempt, or shrieked “sedition!”\r\n\r\nWhatever blame lay with the authorities seemed to arise from the\r\nusual official tendency to make light of distress for fear of\r\nincreasing difficulties, and to temper benevolence with bad manners.\r\nI think both tendencies were interestingly combined in a Bengali\r\nDeputy Magistrate, who was superintending the relief in one of the\r\nlarger villages. I was myself travelling with Mr. Madhu Sudan Das,\r\na resident of Cuttack, highly educated on European lines, the only\r\nUriya graduate of Calcutta, and a man well known throughout India\r\nfor his unlimited generosity and devotion to his own people, whose\r\nrights he had often vindicated against aggression. From early manhood\r\nhe had been a Christian, though perhaps not a very dogmatic and\r\necclesiastical Christian, his faith being founded entirely upon his\r\nheartfelt admiration of Christ’s prayer, “Father, forgive them, for\r\nthey know not what they do.” “The man who could utter that prayer\r\nwhile dying under torture was divine,” he often said to me. “The\r\nmoment I heard the prayer, I recognized that truth, and I have never\r\ndoubted it since.”\r\n\r\nBut Christian though he was, and though his daughter had studied in\r\nCambridge, and now lived in Cuttack like an English lady without a\r\nshade of “purdah,” he was almost worshipped as the saint of Orissa\r\nby the poor among his countrymen. I have seen a man with a frightful\r\nrunning sore entreat Mr. Das to lend him the eighth of a penny that\r\nhe might touch the sore with it and be healed. Another came with a\r\nbrass bowl and implored Mr. Das to dip his finger into the water that\r\nhis wife might be delivered from her dangerous labour, and the moment\r\nhe dipped his finger into the water, the child was safely born.\r\n\r\nUnhappily, in spite of his Christianity and saintly reputation, Mr.\r\nDas appeared to act on official minds much as a hedgehog would on a\r\nnaked man who found one rolled up in his bed. On arriving one night\r\nat a dak-bungalow or rest-house, we found that two of the three rooms\r\nwere occupied by a Bengali magistrate and a colleague. So having\r\narranged that Mr. Das, who was oldish and invalid, should have the\r\nother room while I slept in the free air like the elephant, we sent\r\nin our names to the Deputy Magistrate and were invited to enter.\r\nKnowing Mr. Das well by reputation, he had evidently determined not\r\nto fall below the standard of European dignity. Consequently he\r\nreceived us with his legs on the long arms of his deck-chair—an\r\nattitude which, I suppose, he had observed as customary among English\r\nofficials when they receive “natives,” and I could not correct his\r\nimpression.\r\n\r\nMr. Das began by requesting him to hear the petitions of three or\r\nfour widows who stood lamenting outside the door because their\r\nhusbands had died of starvation. Entrenched behind his legs, the\r\nofficial refused to comply, stating that he had already heard their\r\ncases, and had proved to his own satisfaction that the men had not\r\ndied of starvation, but of something else. Mr. Das then went through\r\na number of other cases, in most of which the official said he\r\nthought he had made examination, but could not be sure. Anyhow, all\r\ncharges of neglect or harshness against the officials were absolutely\r\nfalse, and he was not there to be cross-examined. With prickly\r\ninsistence, Mr. Das continued his interrogations upon the complaints\r\nof the villagers, till at last the Deputy Magistrate, irritated past\r\nhuman endurance, refused to say any more, and waving good-night to\r\nhis boots we left the room.\r\n\r\nOn our return journey, a day or two later, we discovered that he had\r\nsent out orders by the _chaukidars_ or village police to all the\r\nvillages round, commanding the people not to come out to meet us\r\nunder threats of unknown penalties. So great is the terror inspired\r\nby officials and police under a bureaucracy, that very few came of\r\nthe hundreds who had before thronged our path in hopes of winning\r\nsome assistance, or merely of seeing the elephant and their national\r\nfavourite. The few who did come told us the truth with fear, and\r\nperhaps we should never have got at the real facts if we had not\r\nfound a chaukidar in one village actually going round from house to\r\nhouse with the order. Yet Mr. Das was a man whose assistance in such\r\na crisis any one but an official would have been delighted to secure;\r\nfor the people trusted him absolutely, in spite of his foreign\r\nreligion, and no one living understood them better. It was only that\r\nhe was the kind of man who perturbs tabulated columns.\r\n\r\nMost administrators would find it much easier to appreciate a Rajah\r\nor Tributary Chief who lived about twenty miles from Cuttack, and\r\nexpended, as I was told, £335 on a breakfast which he expected\r\nto offer the Lieutenant-Governor with the usual trimmings of\r\ndancing-girls, fireworks, and other delights. At such a breakfast\r\ncases of starvation could hardly occur, and nothing would interrupt\r\nthe cheers, loyalty, and goodwill, such as Simla and the Anglo-Indian\r\npapers were expecting from the proposed Advisory Councils of\r\nNotables. Yet £335 did seem a largish sum to consume at one meal in\r\nthe midst of a starving people. Perhaps the Lieutenant-Governor\r\nthought so too, for I believe he continued his progress without\r\naccepting the entertainment. One would like to know how that meal was\r\never consumed. Perhaps the elephants were called in to help.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[35] “The Great Famine,” by Mr. Vaughan Nash (Longmans, 1900).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n“LORD OF THE WORLD”\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom every part of India, by day and night, the pilgrims come,\r\nand the roads to the great temple, by the sea at Puri, are always\r\nopen and always thronged. The pilgrims come from behind the white\r\nmountains, and from the purple lands of the south, and across the hot\r\nplains from the other ocean. The train that shot me out upon the sand\r\namid a crowd of dim white figures at three o’clock one morning raises\r\na high dividend from religion. Hundreds come by it every day, for it\r\nsaves time—and under British rule even devotion goes by time. But\r\nworshippers still think it more religious and purifying to make the\r\nwhole journey on foot, visiting other sacred temples upon the road,\r\nbathing in holy rivers, and turning at every dawn towards the rising\r\nsun, as all mankind instinctively turn for worship, just as for love\r\nwe turn towards the sunset. To take years upon the journey only\r\nextends the glory of expectation, and if you have the holy patience\r\nto travel the Grand Trunk Road, measuring every two yards of its\r\nthousand miles by prostrating your body along the dust, what is\r\nspace, what is time, when you are on the way to God?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TEMPLE OF EQUALITY.\r\n\r\n  [_Face p. 152._\r\n]\r\n\r\nChildren and young mothers come if the entire family sets out for\r\nholiness, but the best time for the great act of worship is late in\r\nmiddle-age, when for many years the field has been sown and reaped,\r\nthe buffalo fed, the taxes paid, the children tended, the cotton\r\ngarment daily washed. Then the present career upon this visible\r\nworld is almost over, the shadowy gate to the next stage upward is\r\nalmost in sight. Then men and women long to go on pilgrimage, and,\r\nuntouched by the cares of fortune, family, or any transitory things,\r\nthey travel forth in calm elation of soul, their thoughts fixed only\r\non the lasting realities of eternity, till they hear the thud of the\r\nlong waves upon the sand, and before them rises the great white tower\r\nof the Lord of the Universe, surmounted by its wheel and flag. There\r\nstands at length the beatific vision, there the end of all these\r\nlabours, the revelation of the Divine Essence for which they had\r\nwaited so many years of repeated seasons in the fields.\r\n\r\nIt is the ancient temple of Juggernath, “Lord of the World,” to\r\nwhich they have come. Yes, our old friend Juggernath, of childhood’s\r\nstories and journalistic tags—the God in the Car, before whose\r\nbloodstained wheels the benighted heathen were driven by deceiving\r\npriests to fling themselves shrieking down, before the days when\r\nenlightened missionaries and British rulers combined to clean up\r\nIndia’s coral strand. Since then, as is well known, such extremity of\r\ndevotion has been prosecuted as the law directs, and the guide-book\r\ntells us that “of recent years much has been done to improve the\r\nsanitation of the place.” Both signs of progress are good. But, after\r\nall, it is only an Englishman whose first thought is of sanitation\r\nwhen he approaches the divine presence, and the British missionaries\r\nwho first told that weary old tale of the car were as incapable of\r\nunderstanding the divine passion that, even at the cost of life,\r\nyearns for union with eternal powers, as they would have been of\r\nunderstanding the passion of a woman whose grandson described to\r\nme how, with proud bearing and joyful face, she walked from her\r\nchamber and sat down in the midst of the flames beside her husband’s\r\nbody till their ashes lay indistinguishably commingled. Sanitary\r\nappliances and the “Merry Widow” appeal more successfully to our\r\nWestern minds.\r\n\r\nThe fame of Juggernath may be due, as scholars say, to some ancient\r\nattempt to conciliate under his symbol the new Buddhistic reformers\r\nwith the primeval Hindu worship. It seems to be certain that his\r\ntemple as it stands shows the trace of Buddhistic influence—the\r\nteaching of Buddha who made the great renunciation, Buddha who\r\nreceived the poor and all mankind beneath his blessing. It is a\r\nshrine of peace and conciliation, perhaps the one place in India\r\nwhere former generations saw some hope of acquiring the new purity\r\nand kindliness of life, without rejecting the sacred traditions of\r\nimmemorial wisdom brought by unknown ancestors from lands of bitter\r\ncold. And it may have been this bright hope of peace that first\r\nestablished the unaltering rule of Juggernath’s worship, that before\r\nhis sight all castes and ranks and riches are equal, and the woman is\r\nequal with the man.\r\n\r\nLions and monsters guard the four gates of his enclosure, but when\r\nonce they are passed, all the earthly distinctions of mankind fall\r\naway, and only the naked soul remains to worship. Within that oblong\r\nwall, Brahman may eat with sweeper, and warrior with the retail\r\nseller of flesh for carrion Europeans. Along the inner side of the\r\nsouth wall are simple kitchens, where the god’s four hundred cooks\r\ndaily prepare the sacred food for pilgrims, beggars, and all who\r\ncome. One is served with another, and all may eat from the same\r\ndish, side by side, without contamination. Thousands of monks in the\r\nservice of the god carry the food far through the country, and the\r\npilgrims themselves take some of it home in their brazen vessels, so\r\nthat the villagers and children left behind may taste of wisdom, and\r\nshare the blessings of pilgrimage. For wherever the sacred food is\r\neaten, worldly differences disappear, and soul stands bare to soul.\r\nIt is the sacrament of equality, the consecration of mankind.\r\n\r\nSide by side with Juggernath, within the dark and secluded shrine,\r\nupon which no alien may look, stand his brother and little\r\nsister—quaint figures all of them, hideous as gollywogs with\r\nsymbolism—the round and staring eyes of eternal vision, the atrophied\r\nhands and feet of eternal meditation. Every year new cars are built\r\nfor them, and every twelve years the gods themselves are made anew of\r\nwooden blocks, while their old forms are sunk into a pit to perish.\r\nThis was told me by the treasurer and chief trustee of the god’s\r\nvast estate, who traced to this renewal the well-known story of the\r\nphysicians appointed to minister to the deity’s health, and put him\r\nto bed if he ails. He informed me this was a popular error, but there\r\nis a Rajah who is hereditary guardian, and also hereditary sweeper of\r\nthe temple, and he, as I understood, had rather frequently to be put\r\nto bed by his physicians, so that possibly the two cases have become\r\nconfused.\r\n\r\nIt would be, perhaps, too curious to identify the little sister\r\nof Juggernath with Liberty, and his brother with Fraternity. But\r\nJuggernath, “Lord of the World,” has beyond question the attribute\r\nof Equality, and it seems possible that it is just this glorious\r\nattribute, and no deeper metaphysic reason, which gives his temple\r\nits place as the most worshipped fane of India, and inspires the\r\ncommon people with a passionate desire even to touch with one finger\r\nthe painted board of which he is made. Many people worship what most\r\nthey fall short of, just as in England we struggle to worship Christ,\r\nwhose character and manner of life differed so entirely from our own.\r\nAnd of all great virtues the Indians, perhaps, have been most wanting\r\nin the sense of equality. Their whole system of existence is based on\r\ninequality, inevitable and permanent. The man who is born to study\r\nthe Vedas will continue to study the Vedas, and so will his son. The\r\nman who is born to carry sewage will continue to carry sewage, and so\r\nwill his son. Nor could the daughter of a millionaire ever hope for\r\nmarriage with a man of learning, since wisdom lies beyond the dreams\r\nof avarice.\r\n\r\nThis ancient basis of inequality has made the Indian people the\r\neasiest in the world to govern. It lies also, I think, at the bottom\r\nof their almost excessive politeness, their reverential manners,\r\ntheir courtly deference to any one who appears to have been born of\r\nhigher station, or with higher advantages. No one denies the charm\r\nof such qualities. It is an education in behaviour to pass from a\r\nScottish or American crowd to the streets of an Indian city. The\r\nobligations of high caste—such things, I mean, as cleanliness in food\r\nand life, intellectual alertness, and disregard of wealth—are as\r\nvaluable as any obligations laid on Europeans by noblesse. The only\r\nweakness about both is that they are restricted to caste or class,\r\nand are not considered universally binding, as such principles must\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nThere is much to be said for reverential manners; but take a race\r\nwhich has very little notion of manners of any kind—a race not very\r\nsensitive, not very imaginative or sympathetic, trained from boyhood\r\nto think little of personal dignity, and nothing at all of other\r\npeople’s feelings; take such a race and set its most characteristic\r\nmembers from the well-to-do middle classes, with the help of rifles\r\nand batteries, to dominate an entirely different people, among\r\nwhom reverential manners are ingrained by birth, and see what evil\r\neffects for both races will result! Watch the growing arrogance of\r\nthe dominant people; watch their demands for deference, their lust\r\nfor flattery, their irritation at the least sign of independence,\r\ntheir contempt for the race whose obeisance they delight in, their\r\nrudeness of manner increasing till it becomes incredible to the\r\nrelatives they left at home, and would once have been incredible to\r\nthemselves. Then turn to the subordinate race, and watch the growing\r\nweakness of character, the temptation to cringe and flatter, the loss\r\nof self-respect, the increasing cowardice, the daily humiliation.\r\nIn that hideous process—that degeneration in manners of two great\r\nraces, each of which has high qualities of its own, we recognize the\r\ntrue peril which has been advancing upon Indians and ourselves for\r\nthe last ten, or, perhaps, fifty years of Indian history. It is not\r\na question of loss of power, or loss of trade. It is a question of a\r\nmuch more serious loss than these.\r\n\r\nBut what if all this so-called unrest is only the beginning of\r\nanother great humanistic reform, another incarnation of that “Lord\r\nof the World” whose attribute is equality? Throughout India we are\r\nwitnessing the birth of a new national consciousness, and with it\r\ncomes a revival of dignity, a resolve no longer to take insults lying\r\ndown, not to lick the hand that strikes, or rub the forehead in the\r\ndust before any human being, simply because he wears a helmet and is\r\ncalled white. Like pilgrims bound for the shrine of Juggernath in\r\nan ecstasy of devotion, the leaders of India are inspired by that\r\nlonging for equality which is always springing afresh in human minds.\r\nIf any one chooses to say that equality is like Juggernath’s Car,\r\ncrushing everything equally flat, he is welcome to his little jest.\r\nBut as I saw the white-robed pilgrims passing into the temple, there\r\nto partake of equality’s sacrament, I knew that these outward things\r\nwere but the symbols of an invisible worship, which may renew the\r\nface of the Indian people, and save ourselves from a threatening and\r\ndishonourable danger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE DIVIDED LAND\r\n\r\n\r\nThe plains of Eastern Bengal have been formed grain by grain from the\r\nwashings of the dividing range of Asia brought down by melted snow on\r\nits way to the sea. Rivers that rise not very far apart on opposite\r\nsides of the Himalaya here unite at last after their thousand miles\r\nof circuit, and finish their course by broad and quiet streams, which\r\nlose the sacred names of Ganges and Brahmaputra. Some of the rivers\r\nalso spring from the hill-country of Assam and the ranges where the\r\npleasant station of Shillong offers a summer residence for the new\r\nLieut.-Governor of Eastern Bengal as comfortably isolated from his\r\ncapital at Dacca, as Simla or Darjeeling is from Calcutta. Thus the\r\nwhole country is intersected with vast waterways and streams as slow\r\nand curling as the Ouse. Railways are built only in short sections,\r\nas it were to connect the rivers, and continuous roads must be very\r\nfew. Everything goes by water, and the only trouble is that the\r\nrivers sometimes change their course, owing to an earthquake or\r\nother natural caprice. Their channels, too, are continually silting\r\nup, so that the course of the steamers upon their broad surface is\r\nalways a little dubious, and, in spite of its slip of railway, the\r\nnew capital of Dacca is even now being cut off from the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ON THE BRAHMAPUTRA.\r\n\r\n  [_Face p. 160._\r\n]\r\n\r\nBut for the square-sailed junks that the Indians use, and for the\r\nlong black boats with pointed prow and stern pitched high in air, the\r\nrivers form a fine system of traffic; and if the water takes a fancy\r\nfor a new passage through miles of cultivated land the owners of the\r\nfields simply stake out their claims upon the surface, confident\r\nthat in God’s good time the river will withdraw, leaving the soil\r\nto future generations only the richer for its deposit. The whole\r\ncountry is, indeed, one of the richest parts of India, and the rivers\r\npass between flat lands of mangoes and palm trees, jute or yellow\r\nrice. At times the size and stillness of the streams reminded me of\r\nthe Oil Rivers of Southern Nigeria; but how different here are the\r\nfirm and fruitful banks from those gloomy creeks and forests of the\r\nslime! When they are not busy in their sunny fields, the people are\r\nchiefly engaged in washing themselves, their babies, and their brazen\r\nvessels. Large numbers are also occupied in fishing, especially for\r\na bony fish like a gigantic perch, which they drive into the nets\r\nwith tame otters, captive in long leashes. Others live by converting\r\nthe clay of the banks into enormous potting jars that serve as\r\nstores for grain, _ghee_ (clarified butter), and other food. The\r\nwaterways also still carry a certain amount of the country’s ancient\r\nindustries—the gold and silver work, the bangles and ornaments cut\r\nfrom white conchs, and, above all, the hand-woven muslins for which\r\nDacca was once celebrated throughout the world.\r\n\r\nSince England killed the Indian cotton industry for the benefit of\r\nLancashire, first by imposing duties on imports from India, and\r\nthen by the present excise of 3½ per cent. upon Indian cottons\r\nmanufactured for India itself, that ancient fame is chiefly found in\r\nmuseum specimens of past splendour, and in lingering words like the\r\nFrench “Indienne” for calico print. Even in Dacca the very finest\r\nmuslin, such as the cows used to lick up with the grass, feeling\r\nno difference between it and gossamer, is no longer made. It has\r\nfallen out, partly owing to Manchester, partly because there are no\r\nlonger enough rich Indians to buy it. But still the great caste of\r\nweavers have clung to their hand-looms as fondly as starving ryots\r\ncling to the land. There is hardly any difference of race in Bengal,\r\nbut it so happens that nearly all the weavers are Mohammedans,\r\ndescended from the old Hindu families who changed their religion to\r\nplease their conquerors in the days when Dacca itself was an Islam\r\ncapital of empire. In the last three years, the Swadeshi movement,\r\nwhich officials have told Lord Morley is specially abhorrent to\r\nMohammedans, has enormously increased their industry. It has revived\r\nthe ancient craft just as it was dying, and so I found the weavers\r\nin every town and village sitting on the floor, with legs stuck\r\nunder the wooden loom, plying their thin-spun thread with hereditary\r\nskill—plying it sometimes under water, so that a woman’s skin should\r\nhardly feel a stuff so fine and soft.\r\n\r\nBut one can never be sure how long a handicraft, no matter how\r\nbeautiful, can hold its own against the mills. Even under Swadeshi\r\nthe hand-looms will probably disappear, and the main produce of\r\nEastern Bengal is no longer the most delicate fabric in the world,\r\nbut the roughest. It is jute. It is not literally true that this\r\ndark and fibrous plant, something between a mallow and a flax, grows\r\nonly in East Bengal, but it grows best there, and almost all that\r\nis used in the jute factories of Dundee is imported from this land\r\nof rivers. I believe it was through the Dundee shippers, not more\r\nthan one generation ago, that jute first came to the Tay, but since\r\nthen the prosperity of the jute wives on the Tay has varied with the\r\nprosperity of the peasant wives on the Ganges, and, unhappily, it has\r\noften varied inversely.\r\n\r\nIt is very doubtful whether the immense increase of the jute crop\r\nhas been of real benefit to the peasant. The price is variable. In\r\n1906, for example, it went up to 14_s._ 8_d._ a maund (82 lbs.), and\r\nall the peasants laid down their land in jute, thus creating such\r\na scarcity of rice that its price went up more than double—from an\r\naverage of 5_s._ 4_d._ to 12_s._ a maund. In some districts rice rose\r\nto more than three times its normal price. Drought and flood combined\r\nto increase the scarcity, and a terrible famine ensued. Of course, it\r\nought not to have been so. Economists would say that the sale of the\r\njute and the export of the rice should bring in money with which the\r\npeasants could purchase food. The trouble was that reality refused to\r\nsupport the economic doctrine.\r\n\r\nJute, like flax, is a very exhausting crop, yet I have seen it\r\nactually planted on the same field with rice, and at the same time,\r\nbecause it grows quicker, and can be harvested while the rice is\r\ngreen and short. Nothing but a deluge can restore the soil so\r\ntreated, and, at the best, jute wants more room and more labour.\r\nThen there are the middlemen to be considered—the British and Jewish\r\nmiddlemen who swarm at the centres of the jute trade, where the heavy\r\nwooden junks lie thick as a town upon the rivers. Lastly, there is\r\nthe zemindar or landowner. He comes under the Permanent Settlement\r\nof Bengal, and his rent or tax to Government is fixed for ever. But\r\nwithin limits he can raise the rent on the cultivator, and it is\r\nin the nature of landlords to raise the rent. They are not rich\r\nthemselves, these zemindars. Throughout Bengal I heard lamentable\r\nstories of their genteel but increasing poverty that reminded me\r\nof the distressed Irish landlords of twenty years ago. Like the\r\nFrench, they have the custom of dividing the land equally among the\r\nchildren, and the Mohammedans endow their daughters in the division,\r\nwhich is very nice of them, but only hastens the family ruin. Unless\r\na zemindar family launches out into other forms of labour beyond\r\neating its rents, the number of hangers-on to small parcels of land\r\nincreases, and their condition is often pitiable. All the more\r\nbecause, though the Settlement is permanent, the cesses or rates\r\nnominally levied for roads and District Boards, but really applied\r\nto all manner of other purposes, are continually increasing, and the\r\ncurse of malaria, which saps the vitality and rots the brain, appears\r\nto be falling with peculiar virulence upon the zemindar class.\r\n\r\nIt is a question whether jute and the export of rice have benefited\r\nany one except the merchants and middlemen. Owing to the fall in\r\njute, the peasants were growing quantities of rice again when I was\r\nthere; but next year the rice might go down and jute up, and so they\r\nlive in a gambler’s uncertainty, and lay up no store of food, as the\r\ncustom used to be, against the evil day. They sell everything as it\r\ngrows, and with the money buy Rangoon rice which makes them sick.\r\nMany paternal officials, though bred on our university economics,\r\ntold me that to save the people they would even prohibit jute, tax\r\nexported rice, and abolish the cotton excise.\r\n\r\nSo far we may say the contest lies between Dundee and Eastern\r\nBengal, but though I believe it to be a vital matter, that contest\r\nis tranquil and slow compared to the dramatic battle raging between\r\nEastern Bengal and the British cities of Liverpool and Manchester.\r\nLiverpool stands for salt, Manchester for cotton, and Eastern Bengal\r\nhas taken a solemn vow not to touch either their salt or their cotton\r\ntill the burning wrong of Bengal is redressed. By the burning wrong\r\nthey mean the Partition of the Bengali people into two separate\r\nand unconnected governments, Bengal proper to contain 18,000,000\r\nof the race, and Eastern Bengal to contain 25,000,000. With the\r\naddition of the outlying and alien provinces of Behar, Chota Nagpur,\r\nand Orissa, Lord Curzon estimated the population of Bengal under\r\nthe old capital of Calcutta at 54,000,000, of whom 9,000,000 would\r\nbe Mohammedans; while, including the outlying and alien province\r\nof Assam, the population of “Eastern Bengal and Assam” with a new\r\ncapital at Dacca would come to 31,000,000, of whom 18,000,000 would\r\nbe Mohammedans. Throughout the whole of Bengal, whether East or West,\r\nit must be again remembered that the people are homogeneous, both\r\nMohammedans and Hindus belonging to the Bengali race, speaking the\r\nsame language, living in amity side by side for generations past, and\r\nonly divided in religion because some of their number, chiefly of the\r\nlower and less educated castes, had long ago embraced Islam for the\r\nmost persuasive of reasons.[36]\r\n\r\nVarious schemes for sharing out the administrative burden of the vast\r\nprovince with its dependencies had been discussed for at least twelve\r\nyears before, and there were obvious ways in which it could have\r\nbeen done—by creating the three contiguous districts of different\r\nrace into a new western province with the capital at Patna, or by\r\nplacing them under Chief Commissioners, while in either case Bengal\r\nshould be raised to a Presidency under a Governor in Calcutta,\r\nenjoying the same privileges as Madras and Bombay. By the Charter\r\nof 1833 we promised a Governorship for Fort William (Calcutta), and\r\nthe promise was renewed by Lord Dalhousie in 1853. It is hard in\r\nEngland to understand the difference that Indians feel between a\r\nLieutenant-Governor trained in Anglo-Indian routine and a Governor\r\nappointed from among the leading men of England, and coming to\r\ntheir country free from the narrowing routine of the Service and\r\nAnglo-Indian society. But a very short time in India shows what that\r\ndifference means.\r\n\r\nFar from carrying out these pledges or following a smaller scheme\r\nof devolution favoured by Mr. Brodrick (Lord Midleton), at that time\r\nSecretary of State for India, Lord Curzon determined to split the\r\nBengali people roughly in half and give them two Lieutenant-Governors\r\ninstead of one—with a view, of course, to “greater administrative\r\nefficiency”; for, as Mr. John Morley somewhere remarked, “the usual\r\nexcuse of those who do evil to other people is that their object is\r\nto do them good.” The first sign of Lord Curzon’s purpose was Sir\r\nHerbert Risley’s letter of December 3, 1903, announcing a Partition\r\nin the name of the Government of India. The scheme then proposed\r\nwas instantly met by a storm of opposition throughout Bengal, among\r\nMohammedans and Hindus alike, and to the credit of Anglo-Indians it\r\nmust be said that the opposition of the Bengalis was supported by\r\nmany of the officials and by the leading Anglo-Indian newspapers,\r\nthough the worldly success of officials and newspapers largely\r\ndepends on Government favour.\r\n\r\nAlways impatient of criticism, Lord Curzon hastened through Eastern\r\nBengal, lecturing the Hindu leaders and trying to win over the\r\nMoslems. With the Moslems, by one means or another, he partially\r\nsucceeded, but the opposition among the bulk of the Bengal population\r\ncontinued as determined as ever. Hundreds of indignation meetings\r\nwere held; I believe about two thousand in all. Great petitions\r\nwere presented; one with 70,000 signatures attached was sent to\r\nthe Home Government. But it was all in vain. The English people\r\npaid no attention; they were not sure where Bengal was; most of\r\nthem had never heard of it apart from tigers, and did not care what\r\nPartition meant. The Home Government perhaps had its own reasons for\r\n“letting Curzon down gently.” The scheme was hustled through almost\r\nin secrecy, and almost avowedly against his better judgment, Mr.\r\nBrodrick gave his assent. The fatal “Government Resolution on the\r\nPartition of Bengal” was issued from Simla on July 19, 1905; it was\r\nfollowed by the Proclamation of September 1st, and a blow was given\r\nto the credit of our country and to her reputation for justice and\r\npopular government, from which it will take us long years of upright\r\nadministration and reform to recover.[37]\r\n\r\nOn October 16th of the same year the Resolution took effect, and\r\nthe Partition became what Mr. Morley in an unhappy moment called “a\r\nsettled fact.” The anniversary of that national wrong has now become\r\nthe Ash Wednesday of India. On that day thousands and thousands of\r\nIndians rub dust or ashes on their foreheads; at dawn they bathe in\r\nsilence as at a sacred fast; no meals are eaten; the shops in cities\r\nand the village bazaars are shut; women refuse to cook; they lay\r\naside their ornaments; men bind each other’s wrists with a yellow\r\nstring as a sign that they will never forget the shame; and the whole\r\nday is passed in resentment, mourning, and the hunger of humiliation.\r\nIn Calcutta vast meetings are held, and the errors of the Indian\r\nGovernment are exposed with eloquent patriotism. With each year the\r\nindignation of the protest has increased; the crowds have grown\r\nbigger, the ceremonial more widely spread, the fast more rigorous.\r\n\r\nSuch was the Partition of Bengal, prompted, as nearly all educated\r\nIndians believe, by Lord Curzon’s personal dislike of the Bengali\r\nrace, as shown also by his Convocation speech of the previous\r\nFebruary, in which he brought against the whole people an indictment\r\nfor mendacity.[38] The Partition marks the beginning of the “unrest”\r\nin its present form. I think some kind of unrest would have been\r\ndeveloped within the next few years in any case. It arises from all\r\nmanner of deep-lying causes—from the success of Asiatic Japanese in\r\nwar against a great European power, from the general communication by\r\nrailway, the visits of even high-caste Brahmans to Europe, the use of\r\nEnglish as a common tongue, the increasing knowledge of our history\r\nand liberties, and the increasing study of our great Liberal thinkers\r\nand John Morley’s works. Add to these things the growing alienation\r\nof the subject races, owing to notorious cases of injustice in\r\nthe law courts, ill-mannered arrogance on the part of certain\r\nAnglo-Indians, abusive incitements to violence by Anglo-Indian\r\nnewspapers, and a system of espionage by the police and postal\r\nofficials. It would be a wonder indeed if any people with a grain of\r\nself-respect left in them had remained unmoved. But beyond question\r\nit was the Partition that directly occasioned the present outbreaks\r\nof distrust and hostility. When their petitions remained unanswered,\r\nand their public meetings had no effect, when the Partition was\r\ncarried out with despotic indifference to their feelings and\r\ninterests, the Bengali people, and through them the vast majority of\r\neducated Indians, unwillingly became convinced that England no longer\r\ncared what happened to them or their country, provided they paid the\r\nrevenue and kept quiet. It was a dangerous conviction to which they\r\nhad been brought. England as a whole neither knew nor cared anything\r\nabout it. She thought she had done enough when she had entrusted Lord\r\nCurzon and the Home Government with the duty of knowing and caring.\r\n\r\nAll advocates of the Partition, from Sir Harvey Adamson downwards,\r\nhave continually sneered at the Bengali objection to having their\r\ncountry cut in half as “sentimental.”[39] By “sentimental” I find\r\nthat this sort of people always understand an emotion that does not\r\nbring in sixpence. For instance, if we love our country because of\r\nher reputation for justice and freedom, they call us hysterical\r\nsentimentalists; but if we love our country because trade follows\r\nthe flag, they call us sound supporters of the Empire. In accordance\r\nwith this despicable standard, we may say that the chief objection\r\nto the Partition is one of sentiment. It is none the less strong on\r\nthat account. It is the same kind of sentiment as would set Scotland\r\nablaze with indignation if an English Prime Minister drew a jagged\r\nline from Thurso to Dumfries, and announced that in future Scotland\r\nwould consist of two separate provinces, with one government in\r\nEdinburgh and the other in Glasgow, and no connection between them.\r\nA Scotsman’s chief objection might be described as “sentimental”\r\nby people of Sir Harvey Adamson’s mind, but I think “unrest” would\r\nhardly be the word for what would follow.\r\n\r\nYet that is exactly what England has allowed to be done in Bengal.\r\nThe root of the indignation is a sentiment—an emotion that does\r\nnot bring in sixpence. It is the sentiment of a patriotic and\r\nprogressive race cut in two by an action which they believe to have\r\nbeen arbitrary and suggested by pique. And just because it is a\r\nsentiment, no material advantage or convenience of administration\r\ncan ever serve as compensation for the wrong. But even if outraged\r\nnational feeling could be set aside as a sentimental complaint,\r\nthe other grievances are strong. Calcutta is justly claimed by all\r\nBengalis for their own capital, as well as the capital of India. It\r\nis the centre of their culture and trade, of justice and government.\r\nIt has the best Indian newspapers; it is the home of the best social\r\nintercourse; its University sets the standard of knowledge; its High\r\nCourt is regarded with confidence by all Indians as a sure appeal\r\nagainst injustice. To be separated from Calcutta and compelled to\r\nlook to poor, ruinous, decrepit old Dacca as their capital is for\r\nBengalis an intellectual and material loss. Dacca was a good enough\r\nMohammedan capital three centuries ago, but now it is difficult to\r\nget at; its river, as I said, is silting up; it has not a single\r\nnewspaper worthy of the name; it has no University, no High Court,\r\nand its new Lieutenant-Governor lives for months together far away\r\nat Shillong, almost inaccessible in the hills. It is true that\r\nGovernment has bought a lot of land north of the town and has laid\r\nout foundations for residences and offices where future officials can\r\nenjoy themselves in comfort. The existence of those foundations is a\r\ncommon argument against reversing the Partition even among the many\r\nofficials who recognized its error. But to the Bengalis it only makes\r\nthe thing worse, for their wretched country will now have to pay fora\r\ndouble set of buildings, a double set of high and low officials, and\r\na double set of questionable police.\r\n\r\nThere are other points. No one but landlords feels much disturbed\r\nat the woes of landlords, who suck their livelihood off the land\r\nlike ticks off a sheep. But even sheep-ticks have their feelings,\r\nand in Eastern Bengal the zemindars also have a certain use in\r\nthe world, especially when hunger drives them to cultivate their\r\nland themselves. To the zemindars the Partition has been a loss\r\nand hardship, increasing their legal expenses, and reducing such\r\namenity as life afforded them. Naturally, their sufferings are worst\r\nwhen the line of partition passes straight through their land and\r\nexposes their flanks to double lawyers’ fees from right and left.\r\nAn Englishman whose ancestral estate had been thus divided between\r\nthe two provinces, told me his existence had been rendered almost\r\nintolerable. He had always been accustomed to go to Calcutta for\r\nbusiness connected with the estate, and as he was a celebrated\r\npolo-player and took an intelligent interest in horse-racing, his\r\nbusiness visits to the capital were both frequent and pleasing. But\r\nnow for more than half his business he had to travel far away to\r\ndingy Dacca—no horse-racing; no polo renown! This was no imaginary\r\nor sentimental grievance like the indignation of a proud and ancient\r\nrace split in two for the satisfaction of its rulers, and I felt sure\r\nthat if only such a case could be brought home to the sportsmanlike\r\ngovernors of our Empire, they would persuade Lord Morley to regard\r\nhis “settled fact” in a more pliable spirit.\r\n\r\nThe Eastern Bengalis also object to being bound up with the backward\r\nprovince of Assam, whose people they regard as semi-barbarous, and\r\nfor whose improvement they alone will now have to pay, whereas the\r\ncost was formerly shared by all India. “Are we to be Assamese for\r\never?” is the scornful question of even Mohammedan peasants when they\r\nmeet the sort of man who knows the news. Equally significant was\r\na small Assamese deputation which came to me in Calcutta, because\r\nthey had heard I was a Liberal, and they supposed that a Liberal\r\nGovernment would listen to Liberal principles. Their petition was for\r\nhelp in removing the yoke which now binds them to Eastern Bengal,\r\nwhere the progressive and educated population are too clever for them\r\nby half!\r\n\r\nBut of all material grievances—of all grievances other than the\r\ncentral crime of cutting a nationality in half—I think the Eastern\r\nBengalis most fear their threatened separation from the Calcutta\r\nHigh Court. It is true that the blow has not yet fallen, but it\r\nis almost certain to fall, and the Government has refused to give\r\nany pledge against it. When I consulted Sir Andrew Fraser, the\r\nLieutenant-Governor of Bengal, upon this subject, he very kindly\r\nreferred me to Sir Herbert Risley’s answer to the Bengal Chamber of\r\nCommerce, which had from the first petitioned against the change.[40]\r\nIn Sir Andrew Fraser’s opinion, “Lord Curzon’s Government there\r\nplaced clearly on record their view that nothing less than a High\r\nCourt could ever be established in the new province,” but he appears\r\nto me to have misread the document. In the main sections of his\r\nreply, Sir Herbert Risley carefully guards the Government three times\r\nover from making any guarantee as to the future. He states it as the\r\nGovernment’s opinion:—\r\n\r\n  “That it is most unlikely that in the event of the existing\r\n  judicial machinery being found inadequate for the service of\r\n  the two provinces and of public opinion then demanding the\r\n  establishment of a Chartered High Court, any tribunal occupying a\r\n  position of less authority and influence would either be proposed\r\n  by the Government of India or sanctioned by the Secretary of State.”\r\n\r\nBut he refuses to bind the future Government either to maintain the\r\npresent connection between Eastern Bengal and the Calcutta High\r\nCourt, or to establish a new High Court at Dacca in its place. The\r\nfear of the Eastern Bengalis is that in place of a High Court, which\r\nis regarded throughout India as the embodiment of true British\r\njustice uncontaminated by Anglo-Indian prejudice and tradition,\r\nthey may be put off with a Chief Court, in which the judges have\r\nbeen trained under the distorting influence of that prejudice and\r\ntradition. It is hard for us, accustomed to regard all our Courts\r\nas fairly equal in the dispensation of justice, to realize what\r\nthat difference implies to Indians. But it is exactly parallel to\r\nthe difference they recognize between most Anglo-Indians and the\r\nEnglishman straight from home.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[36] See Introduction, p. 10 ff, and for the history of Eastern\r\nBengal see Mr. Bradley Birt’s “Romance of an Eastern Capital,” _i.e._\r\nDacca.\r\n\r\n[37] See Introduction, p. 12.\r\n\r\n[38] See Introduction, p. 7 ff.\r\n\r\n[39] Sir Harvey Adamson’s speech at St. Andrew’s Dinner in Calcutta,\r\n1907.\r\n\r\n[40] Proceedings of the Home Department, Simla, October 2, 1905.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nSWADESHI AND THE VOLUNTEERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Partition led to Swadeshi. Of course, there was nothing new in\r\nan attempt to encourage Indian industries. For thirty years past\r\nthe true friends of India, like Sir William Wedderburn, had been\r\ninsisting that the solution of her economic miseries lay partly\r\nin diverting some portion of her agricultural population to the\r\nindustrial work for which she used to be celebrated till England\r\nstamped on her manufactures and determined to use her only as a farm\r\nfor raw material and a market for Lancashire. Artistic people had\r\nalso attempted to realize the same object, for it did not require\r\na politician’s eye to perceive the immense superiority of Indian\r\nfabrics in point of beauty. But the true Swadeshi movement dates\r\nfrom the year of the Partition. I believe it was first suggested by\r\nMr. Krishna Kumar Mitra in his paper _Sanjibani_, when he declared\r\nthat India’s one sure means of drawing England’s attention to the\r\nPartition and other wrongs was the boycott of British goods. The\r\nmovement, however, did not become public till a great meeting held\r\nin Calcutta Town Hall on August 7, 1905, to protest against the\r\nPartition. A form of oath was then drawn up by Mr. Surendra Nath\r\nBanerjea, Principal of Ripon College, Editor of the _Bengali_, and\r\nprobably the most prominent leader of the Congress party in Bengal,\r\nand the oath ran as follows:—\r\n\r\n  “I hereby pledge myself to abstain from the purchase of all\r\n  English-made goods for at least a year from this date. So help me\r\n  God.”\r\n\r\nThus a movement which had been entirely economic for some twenty\r\nyears suddenly became political, and the boycott was added to\r\nSwadeshi. The growth of the new phase was rapid. It spread like a\r\ngospel through both provinces of Bengal. Within a few months the\r\nreports of our Commissioners were full of it.\r\n\r\n  “The Swadeshi movement has contributed largely to the development\r\n  of the cotton cloth industry in all the districts of this\r\n  division,” writes the Commissioner of Burdwan in Western Bengal\r\n  (1906-7), “except Bankura, where the inclination of the people to\r\n  use country-made things is not pronounced and consequently the sale\r\n  of Manchester goods has not much decreased.”\r\n\r\nIn the _Indian Trade Journal_ (July 25, 1907), published by the\r\nGovernment, the Magistrate of Hooghly is quoted:—\r\n\r\n  “It appears that while formerly the weavers had to take advances\r\n  from the middlemen, they are now very much better off, and, if\r\n  anything, the middlemen are sometimes indebted to them.... There\r\n  cannot be any doubt that, on account of the Swadeshi movement, the\r\n  weavers as a class, who are a stay-at-home people, have distinctly\r\n  advanced. Fly-shuttle looms arc being largely used, and the people\r\n  are said to appreciate them.”\r\n\r\nIn the Report on the Land Revenue Administration of the Lower\r\nProvinces (1906-7) we read—\r\n\r\n  “It is reported that on account of the demand for country-made\r\n  cloths, weavers working with the fly-shuttle can make as much as\r\n  Rs 20 (£1 6_s._ 8_d._) a month” (about double the average earnings\r\n  of the class) “and that the demand for their services is daily\r\n  increasing ... some prospect of improvement in their material\r\n  condition is held out by the present Swadeshi movement, in so far\r\n  as it may induce the younger generation to devote themselves to a\r\n  technical rather than a literary profession.”\r\n\r\nIn the “Report on the Administration of Eastern Bengal, 1905-6,”\r\nwe find that eleven factories had been added in the year to the\r\nseventy-one already existing, the foreign imports showed a decrease\r\nof 16 per cent., and “Liverpool” salt had declined by 6000 tons. It\r\nhas been the same with “imported liquors,” though apparently the\r\ngreat decrease in them does not mean a decline in drinking, but an\r\nincrease in “country” or Swadeshi spirits. The Collector of Dacca,\r\na strong opponent of Swadeshi, or at all events of the boycott,\r\nremarked in his Report for 1906-7—\r\n\r\n  “Even the public women of Dacca and Narainganj took the so-called\r\n  Swadeshi vow and joined the general movement against the use of\r\n  foreign articles. People formerly addicted to imported liquor took\r\n  to country spirit.”[41]\r\n\r\nSuch facts prove how widely the movement prevails among the common\r\npeople. It is necessarily a woman’s movement, because women wear most\r\nof the cotton and do most of the housekeeping. They are the thrifty\r\nsex, because they and the children are generally the first to suffer\r\nfrom want. If they sacrifice cheapness to political conviction, it\r\nshows the conviction is strong; and though now the coarse hand-woven\r\n_sari_ or woman’s garment of the greater part of India (at two to\r\nthree shillings a pair) is almost as cheap as Manchester stuff, and\r\nmuch more durable, the sacrifice has been something. I will add only\r\ntwo further proofs of the movement’s strength. In reviewing the\r\nEnglish exports in cotton piece-goods for May, 1907, the _Times_\r\nremarked: “India took less by 42,492,500 yards;”[42] and sitting by\r\nher mother, a child of Eastern Bengal was heard to ask, “Mother,\r\nis this an English or a Swadeshi mosquito?” “Swadeshi,” the mother\r\nanswered. “Then I won’t kill it,” said the child.\r\n\r\nSuch was the movement which I had found speeding up the eighty or\r\nninety cotton mills in Bombay, because, work as they might, they\r\ncould not keep pace with the demand from Bengal. It is true that\r\nEnglish manufacturers were said to be adopting the simple device of\r\nstamping their Manchester stuff with the Swadeshi mark, but I did not\r\ndiscover how far their deceit was successful.\r\n\r\nThe movement was spreading to all kinds of merchandise besides\r\ncotton. In Calcutta they had started a Swadeshi match-factory, in\r\nDacca soap-works and tanneries. In all Indian towns you will now\r\nfind Swadeshi shops where you may buy native biscuits, cigarettes,\r\nscents, toys, woollens, boots, and all manner of things formerly\r\nimported. Nearly all the trade advertisements in Indian papers are\r\nnow Swadeshi. The officials whom I consulted, from the Governor of\r\nBombay and the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal downwards, professed\r\nsympathy and admiration for the Swadeshi movement. It would be almost\r\nimpossible for them to do anything else, considering the economic\r\nsalvation it may bring to India if it is maintained. Their interest\r\nin this economic development is quite genuine, and I am told that,\r\nthough under official management, the Swadeshi stalls from Eastern\r\nBengal during the Calcutta Congress of 1906 were the success of the\r\nexhibition. But the officials are in a very difficult position.\r\nWith all their love for India, they do not like to stand by and see\r\nBritish trade ruined, neither does the word “boycott” delight the\r\nofficial mind.\r\n\r\nThe Indians themselves have made an attempt to separate Swadeshi\r\nfrom boycott, and again to separate the economic boycott from the\r\npolitical boycott. At the Calcutta Congress (December, 1906) two\r\nresolutions were adopted that were to have a critical influence on\r\nthe stormy Congress in Surat a year later. They ran—\r\n\r\n  “(1) Having regard to the fact that the people of this country\r\n  have little or no voice in the administration and that their\r\n  representations to the Government do not receive due consideration,\r\n  this Congress is of opinion that the boycott movement inaugurated\r\n  in Bengal by way of protest against the Partition of that province\r\n  was and is legitimate.\r\n\r\n  “(2) This Congress accords its most cordial support to the Swadeshi\r\n  movement and calls upon the people of the country to labour for\r\n  its success by making earnest and sustained efforts to promote the\r\n  growth of indigenous industries and to stimulate the production\r\n  of indigenous articles by giving them preference over imported\r\n  commodities, even at some sacrifice.”\r\n\r\nThe first resolution sanctioned the political boycott, and was passed\r\nafter much controversy, and mainly to avoid an open rupture under\r\nthe presidency of the veteran Mr. Dadabhai Naoroji; for, unless the\r\nresolution had been admitted, the Extremists would have left the\r\nCongress. The second resolution was for the encouragement of economic\r\nSwadeshi, and was accepted almost without question.\r\n\r\nIt appears very doubtful whether the Swadeshi movement could have\r\nbeen carried on without a boycott of foreign goods; and as to\r\npolitical boycott, the Swadeshi remained an impotent and æsthetic\r\nconcern till the political movement gave it driving power. Swadeshi\r\nis now so strong that it would probably hold its own even if all\r\npolitical grievances were removed. But its true origin was political,\r\nand hitherto it has been impossible to separate it from its political\r\nmotive—the protest against the Partition of Bengal.\r\n\r\nIn any case, it was the political motive which spread the Swadeshi\r\nvow like a beacon light through Eastern Bengal. In towns and villages\r\nyoung men formed themselves into associations to preach Swadeshi and\r\nthe boycott. Shops that continued the sale of foreign goods were\r\nsurrounded by youths who implored customers for the sake of their\r\ncountry to depart without purchasing. Boys threw themselves prostrate\r\nin supplication before the customer’s feet. This form of picketing\r\nwas never violent, and I think it was not often prosecuted. It is\r\ntrue the officials regarded it with disfavour, and at Barisal Sir\r\nBampfylde Fuller personally compelled the leading men of the town\r\nto withdraw a Swadeshi appeal they were issuing to the villages\r\n(November 16, 1905), and through the District Magistrate and Police\r\nhe broke up a Provincial Conference which was being held in the same\r\ntown (April 15, 1906). But in some places the boycott took the form\r\nof destroying British goods, especially “Liverpool salt,” and the\r\ngoods were not always paid for first, though usually they were. In\r\none case, four youths destroyed foreign sugar, valued at is 1_s._\r\n2_d._, and were sentenced to three and four months’ imprisonment,\r\nwith heavy fines. As is usual when political offences are savagely\r\npunished, the victims triumphed as heroes in the popular mind.\r\n\r\nBut when I was in Eastern Bengal, the time for that kind of boycott\r\nhad passed. Even the remotest villages knew the principle of Swadeshi\r\nthen, and the chief importance of the preaching movement among the\r\nyoung men was the stimulus it gave to the so-called “Volunteers.”\r\nIn the previous summer (1907), the phrase “National Volunteers” had\r\nroused alarm among sensationalists at home; but it was unknown in\r\nEastern Bengal, and I believe it to have been the sole invention of a\r\ncorrespondent in Calcutta, who had at that time set himself to make\r\nthe flesh of the British public creep. The Volunteers were originally\r\norganized in the ’eighties to act as stewards at the National Indian\r\nCongress, but under the enthusiasm of the Swadeshi and national\r\nmovement, they have developed along many other lines. I met them\r\nfirst in Orissa, relieving the distress from famine and flood there,\r\nthough Eastern Bengal was still their proper sphere. In Barisal,\r\nthe centre of the Bakerganj district, which was then the only part\r\nof India proclaimed under the Seditious Meetings Act, I first met\r\none of the “captains,” a mere boy, who explained to me the peculiar\r\nmixture of politics and philanthropy in their duties. In the Barisal\r\nBraja Mohun Institution, whose Principal, Mr. Aswini Kumar Dutt, is a\r\nnotable Nationalist, the students had formed a society of Volunteers\r\ncalled “The Little Brothers of the Poor,” for nursing among the\r\nvillages, especially in the commonest and most deadly plagues of\r\ncholera and small-pox. The Oxford Brethren, who have a strong\r\nsettlement in that unruly place and, I think, the only beautiful\r\nAnglican church in India, spoke of the movement as not unworthy of\r\nits famous name, though they themselves refused to take any part in\r\nthe political controversies around them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A TEMPLE TANK.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A TEMPLE OF SHIVA.\r\n\r\n  [_Face p. 186._\r\n]\r\n\r\nBut the work of the Volunteers is not chiefly a matter of nursing\r\nand poor relief. In Calcutta and other cities they arrange public\r\nmeetings and organize the course of the immense pilgrimages. At fairs\r\nand the great festivals when Hindu women come from all over the\r\ncountry to bathe in the sacred rivers, they act as their protectors\r\nagainst the rowdy class of Mohammedans, who regard women as their\r\nnatural prey. When the Mohammedans, after the Partition, were induced\r\nto believe that the Government would connive at any violence on their\r\npart against the Hindu inhabitants, the Volunteers attempted a\r\ndefence of their homes and temples. They were generally beaten,\r\nbut they are doing their best to stiffen their courage and the\r\nfighting qualities we all admire. Ever since Macaulay’s time the\r\nAnglo-Indians have wasted much of their lives in sneering at Indians,\r\nand especially at Bengalis, for effeminacy and unwarlike habit. By\r\nathletics, gymnastics, by football with bare feet, and lathi-play\r\nwith the bamboo singlestick, the Volunteers are now seeking to wipe\r\noff the disgrace, and Anglo-Indians suspect sedition. They cannot\r\nhave it both ways, and, for myself, I admire the Indian determination\r\nto obtain bodily strength. For, without being advocates of war at any\r\nprice, we all know what moral force an argument gains when we feel\r\nthat, if sweet reasonableness fails, we could, if we liked, knock the\r\nadversary down and break his bones!\r\n\r\nOf course, some one has to pay for Swadeshi, and it is not always the\r\nBritish merchant who suffers for Lord Curzon’s error. Late one night,\r\nas I sat on a river steamer after two crowded days in a strongly\r\nSwadeshi town, five or six dark forms were dimly seen to gather round\r\nme with gestures of secrecy and peril. In other countries I should\r\nhave thought them assassins thirsting for blood, but they were only\r\nHindu merchants with an interest in Manchester piece-goods. Of these\r\nthey had a large store, I have forgotten how many thousand pounds’\r\nworth, laid up in their warehouses; and, in consequence, they were\r\nshunned by their kind. Barbers would not shave them, milkmen would\r\nnot bring them milk, friends would not come to their daughters’\r\nmarriages, acquaintances would not say good-morning. Such treatment\r\nwas distressing and inconvenient. Would I please use my influence\r\nwith the Home Government, and set everything right again? They\r\nrefused to throw in their lot with the Swadeshi movement; their goods\r\nwere too valuable to be sacrificed, and they preferred to stand and\r\ndie as martyrs in the cause of British commerce. I had no doubt\r\ntheir statement was true, but what hope could I hold out to them?—I,\r\nwho had no influence with the Home Government, and, if I had been\r\nan Indian, would have done my utmost to dissuade my countrymen from\r\nbuying any foreign goods at all till grievances had been redressed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[41] See “Swadeshi-cum-Boycott,” by Hemendra Prasad Ghose; _The\r\nIndian Review_, April, 1908.\r\n\r\n[42] Quoted in the above article.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE NAWAB\r\n\r\n\r\nDacca still wears something of a Mohammedan air, for Akbar’s long\r\narm reached to Eastern Bengal, and the inheritors of his empire here\r\nbuilt a fort, a palace, and a capital. Passing one day among its\r\nenclosed gardens, mouldering lengths of wall, and dying mosques, I\r\nhad begun to imagine myself back in some Turkish town like Ochrida or\r\nMonastir, when I was suddenly recalled to the streams of Brahmaputra\r\nby the appearance of a large wooden cage under a tree in an open\r\ncourt. It was bigger than the cages in which Louis XI. swung his\r\npolitical opponents in the castles of Touraine. It would have held a\r\nbull as well as an eagle, and was firmly set upon a base of stone,\r\ndaubed with vermillion, as is the Hindu way. Life in a cage has\r\nalways seemed to me so curious a choice when this nutshell of a\r\nplanet is itself so small, that I stopped to contemplate it, and,\r\nobserving my interest, the Brahman who accompanied me began to knock\r\nwith a stone upon a large wooden box, which occupied one corner of\r\nthe interior. The summons appeared to be recognized, like the call to\r\na menagerie’s wild beast at feeding time. There was a stir inside,\r\na lid opened, and presently a human head emerged shaggy as John the\r\nBaptist’s, with black hair.\r\n\r\nIt was the city anchorite, whose sleep or meditation we had rather\r\nrudely disturbed. But he took it in good part, as one accustomed\r\nto allow for grosser natures, and, raising himself deftly from his\r\nlair, he stood naked before us, contemplating this garish muddle of\r\na world with shy and melancholy eyes. Human speech was distasteful\r\nto him, but he had come, he said, from a distant province, the name\r\nof which did not concern a mind set upon infinity. All his life now\r\nhe meditated, not directly upon God, but upon the remembered words\r\nof his Guru, or spiritual master, which in time might lead him to\r\nthe meditation upon God Himself. He was unwilling to say more, and,\r\nbeing in haste, I gave him six annas (sixpence) as an endowment of\r\nmeditation, which appears to me far the most difficult achievement of\r\nthe human mind, and he crept back into his box to continue it.\r\n\r\nI was in haste, because I had an appointment with the Nawab Salimulla\r\nof Dacca, certainly the most influential personality in the city,\r\nand perhaps in the province. For the population of Eastern Bengal,\r\nthough nearly all Bengali, is about three-fifths Mohammedan, and,\r\nowing to his father’s wealth, wisdom, and public munificence, the\r\nNawab is regarded by the Mohammedans as their natural leader. It\r\nis an instance of mankind’s touching belief in heredity, for the\r\npresent Nawab is not specially conspicuous for those three claims to\r\nrecognition. His munificence has been largely private, and, added to\r\ncertain peculiarities on the part of his guardian, it has so much\r\nreduced his father’s wealth, that he has been compelled to hand over\r\nthe remainder to the Government Court of Wards, having publicly\r\ndeclared himself a “disqualified proprietor,” incapable of managing\r\nhis own affairs. This cannot, however, in itself imply any lack of\r\nwisdom, for since that public declaration the Government of India\r\nhas reappointed him a member of the Viceroy’s Legislative Council,\r\nas one peculiarly capable of managing the affairs of an Empire. And,\r\nindeed, with regard to the burning question of the Partition, he\r\nhas shown wisdom’s reasonable and open mind. When the Partition was\r\nfirst suggested, he was as much opposed to it as any Bengali could\r\nbe, and I was told that, in his simple-hearted way, he described it\r\nas “beastly.” But such prejudice was not proof against reason, and it\r\nbegan to dissolve under the influence of Lord Curzon’s visit, and the\r\nspeeches in which he promised that the Partition “would invest the\r\nMohammedans of Eastern Bengal with a unity which they had not enjoyed\r\nsince the days of the old Mussulman viceroys and kings.”\r\n\r\nShortly after the Partition the Government of India advanced a loan\r\nto relieve the Nawab’s private munificence from bankruptcy—a loan\r\namounting to about £100,000, at what was, for India, a very low\r\nrate of interest. This benevolent action, combined with certain\r\nprivileges granted to Mohammedans, was supposed by many Hindus to\r\nhave encouraged the Nawab and his co-religionists in taking a still\r\nmore favourable view of the Partition itself.\r\n\r\nNot only so, but priestly mullahs went through the country preaching\r\nthe revival of Islam, and proclaiming to the villagers that the\r\nBritish Government was on the Mohammedan side, that the Law Courts\r\nhad been specially suspended for three months, and no penalty\r\nwould be exacted for violence done to Hindus, or for the loot of\r\nHindu shops, or the abduction of Hindu widows. A Red Pamphlet was\r\neverywhere circulated, maintaining the same wild doctrines. It was\r\nseen that a large proportion of Government posts were set aside\r\nfor Mohammedans, and some were even kept vacant because there was\r\nno Mohammedan qualified to fill them. Sir Bampfylde Fuller said in\r\njest that of his two wives (meaning the Moslem and Hindu sections of\r\nhis province) the Mohammedan was the favourite. The jest was taken\r\nin earnest, and the Mussulmans genuinely believed that the British\r\nauthorities were ready to forgive them all excesses.\r\n\r\nSome two years after his departure from India Lord Curzon wrote to\r\nthe _Times_ that it was “a wicked falsehood” to say that by the\r\nPartition he intended to carve out a Mohammedan State, to drive\r\na wedge between Mohammedan and Hindu, or to arouse racial feuds.\r\nCertainly no one would willingly accuse another of such desperate\r\nwickedness, but a statesman of better judgment might have foreseen\r\nthat, not a racial, but a religious feud would probably be the\r\nresult of the measure. What might have been expected followed. In\r\nComilla, Jamalpur, and a few other places, rather serious riots\r\noccurred. A few lives were lost, temples were desecrated, images\r\nbroken, shops plundered, and many Hindu widows carried off. Some of\r\nthe towns were deserted, the Hindu population took refuge in any\r\n“pukka” house (_i.e._ house with brick or stone walls), women spent\r\nnights hidden in tanks, the crime known as “group-rape” increased,\r\nand throughout the country districts there reigned a general terror,\r\nwhich still prevailed at the time of my visit. Thus a new religious\r\nfeud was established in Eastern Bengal, and when Mr. Morley said in\r\nthe Commons that the disturbance was due to the refusal of Hindus to\r\nsell British goods to Mohammedans, it was a grotesque instance of the\r\npower that officials have of misleading their Chief.\r\n\r\nThe largest of the Nawab’s palaces, looking over the river, is\r\nbuilt in the French style of Louis XIV., but is not so old, having\r\nbeen probably constructed by the present Nawab’s rich and prudent\r\nfather. Similarly, the large collection of knightly armour in the\r\nentrance hall, recalling the onsets of Cressy and Agincourt, do not\r\nsuggest that the present owner’s ancestors were engaged in those\r\nfamous battles, as they would in an English millionaire’s house.\r\nAs a matter of fact, I believe the present Nawab’s grandfather or\r\ngreat-grandfather came from peaceful Kashmir and established the\r\nfamily fortunes originally on carpets. Since his time, while the\r\nfamily fortunes have developed, the family taste has developed too,\r\nand the enormous vaulted room into which I was shown was stuffed with\r\nthe expensive sweepings of European furniture shops. A huge armchair\r\nin cut glass especially fascinated my gaze, and in spite of my haste\r\nI had full time to be fascinated, because the Nawab was an hour and a\r\nhalf late for his appointment, having been detained at another palace\r\nwhere a wife dwelt to whom he was much attached—more attached, I was\r\ntold, than to any other.\r\n\r\nSo there was every excuse for his unpunctuality, and he made none,\r\nbut swept into the room with a smile of benign complacency. He was a\r\nwell-developed man of middle age—something of Falstaff’s prominent\r\npersonality, but preserving the childlike air of innocence and\r\ncandour which nursemaids call “engaging.” Round his large and serene\r\nface, which smiled almost perpetually, hung a loose black fringe of\r\nbeard. He was dressed in little purple slippers, thin pyjamas of\r\nwhite silk, a vest of exquisitely fine Dacca muslin “sprigged” (as\r\nthey say in the china trade) with delicate rosebuds, a copious turban\r\nof the same, and a long purple coat or cloak of flowered brocade,\r\nwith a white border embroidered with passion flowers.\r\n\r\n“My own design!” he exclaimed with justifiable pride, as soon as the\r\nformal greetings were over, holding up the stuff for my inspection\r\nand slowly turning round that I might enjoy its full effect.\r\n\r\nI soon discovered that though his mind was much occupied with\r\nImperial politics, he retained a human interest in home life and the\r\ndomestic arts. Like the elder Dumas, he was particularly proud of his\r\nskill in cooking, and he told me of many wonderful dishes he could\r\nmake.\r\n\r\n“You should taste my nougat!” he cried, and leaning forward like a\r\ndiplomat with a State secret, he added, “Only this morning I composed\r\na new almond toffee!”\r\n\r\nI was not surprised that, with these natural gifts only waiting to be\r\nrecognized, he was keenly alive to a lack of sympathy in his family\r\ncircle.\r\n\r\n“My wife,” (he used the singular, and sighed)—“you have no idea what\r\ndifficulty I have in getting my wife to try a new dish. With her it\r\nis always mutton, mutton, mutton! She has been brought up on mutton,\r\nand Indian women have so little enterprise. She will not try my\r\ndishes.”\r\n\r\n“Let us go hence, my songs; she will not hear,” I quoted in sympathy,\r\nand he sighed again.\r\n\r\n“Our Indian women are very backward,” he went on. “Now, there is my\r\nretired groom, my livery man—what a woman his English wife is! How\r\nfinished! What pleasantness! How much nicer a home she makes for him\r\nthan I can ever get! I will show you the difference.”\r\n\r\nHe called an attendant who had been keeping his eye on me from behind\r\na glass door, and presently the attendant returned with heavy gold\r\nornaments—bracelets, anklets, and necklaces—thickly sprinkled with\r\nsmall turquoises and pearls.\r\n\r\n“I gave these jewels as presents to my wife,” he said. “They are my\r\nown design too. I bought the pearls cheap when the plague was very\r\nbad here, and people were glad to sell everything.”\r\n\r\nI commended this one evidence of ancestral thrift.\r\n\r\n“Then I took the pearls and turquoises and gold to Paris,” he went\r\non, “and drew out a design for the Parisian jewellers to follow. You\r\nsee the result. What grace! What finish I You cannot get finish in\r\nthe East. It is the same with our women. They are backward; they have\r\nno finish.”\r\n\r\nBy a mere slip of the tongue I said I greatly admired what I had\r\nseen of Hindu ladies, and added something about seclusion and purdah.\r\n\r\n“Hindu ladies!” he cried indignantly. “They don’t understand what\r\npurdah is. They might just as well live shamelessly in public. It\r\nis only Mohammedan ladies who practise strict purdah, and seclude\r\nthemselves with absolute delicacy and refinement.”\r\n\r\nI assured him I had supposed no less, and his aspect cleared again.\r\nResuming his lightsome smile, he continued—\r\n\r\n“For myself I am singularly happy. I suppose even the Emperor can\r\nhardly be happier than I am?”\r\n\r\nHe said this in a tentative way, as though appealing to my personal\r\nacquaintanceship with King Edward. But as I could offer no opinion\r\nupon the Emperor’s happiness, he went on—\r\n\r\n“Every morning I feel like a bird. I wake after my sweet sleep, when\r\nthe birds are waking too. 1 like to hear them sing, because I know\r\nthat I am as happy as they can be. I have my troubles of course. I\r\nnever can induce the gardeners to water my flowers at the right time.\r\nThey will water them in the evening when the cool night is coming. I\r\ntell them they ought to water in the morning, as a protection against\r\nthe hot days. They promise to obey, and next evening out they go\r\nagain with their water-pots, as their fathers did before them. There\r\nis no science in the East, no progress, no reason.”\r\n\r\nFor an instant this lamentable truth depressed him, but he revived at\r\nthe recollection of his own assured happiness.\r\n\r\n“I trust entirely to God,” he said. “I leave everything in His hands,\r\nand all goes well. He has always helped me very much. Hitherto He has\r\nhelped me so that I hardly ever have to work. He has never let me\r\nwork very much, and I trust everything to His care. I think that is\r\nwhy I am so happy, and feel like a bird in the morning after my sweet\r\nsleep.”\r\n\r\nI suggested that an easy conscience conduces to sleep and happiness,\r\nand he agreed it was so.\r\n\r\nHe then turned to more general subjects, and, like Lord Curzon, he\r\nmuch regretted the Bengali tendency to lying. It was corrupting even\r\nthe Mohammedans, and nearly all Indian children were brought up\r\nin deception, usually to escape punishment or to give pleasure. I\r\nremarked that even in Europe these motives sometimes lead to deceit,\r\nbut he had formed an ideal of English education, such as the Greeks\r\nformed of Persian. English boys, he said, were taught to ride, shoot,\r\nand tell the truth. It was a fine testimony from a man of education\r\nso different from our own.\r\n\r\nOf Hindus in general, and of Mohammedans who had lost their faith, he\r\nexpressed deep distrust, pointing the moral from the fate of a near\r\nrelation, who, through associating with women and Hindus, was now no\r\nbetter than one of the lost. This grieved me very much, for I had\r\nheard that relation highly spoken of in the town, and he had made me\r\nvarious offers of kindness. But the Nawab was inflexible in virtue.\r\n\r\n“You must fear God,” he said, becoming for a moment almost grave.\r\n“There is no good in praying to God, for He needs nothing that we\r\ncould give Him in exchange for His gifts. But we know that He is\r\npleased with truth, and we must tell it.”\r\n\r\nThen we discussed the Partition, and as I rose to go he exclaimed,\r\n“Here in Dacca I have 10,000 men ready to die for me if I raise my\r\nlittle finger. That is how I keep the peace.”\r\n\r\nHow far he expected to please God by that statement I do not know.\r\nBut probably he was quite sincere, for it is impossible to exhaust or\r\ncaricature the illusions of mankind.\r\n\r\nOne would like to discover the causes of a certain “quality” (as\r\ncountry people say of gentlefolk) that appears common to nearly all\r\nMohammedans. I have felt it almost equally in Constantinople and\r\nother parts of Turkey, in Asia Minor and Crete, in Morocco, and\r\non the West African coast, in Madras, in the North-West Frontier\r\nProvince, and even in the rather petted luxury of the Mohammedan\r\nCollege at Aligarh. In all these places one finds a similar\r\npleasing gravity of manner, courteous address, and an impression of\r\nstraightforward dealing, which, perhaps, would be more trustworthy\r\nif the Sultan were not a Mohammedan. This gentlemanly manner may\r\nexist merely as the heritage of a conquering religion; for in all\r\nthese countries, as in Eastern Bengal, the Mohammedans have come and\r\nstayed as conquerors, and it is easy to acquire fine and aristocratic\r\nmanners when you carry a sword and the other man does not. But at the\r\nback of external behaviour there is a queer mixture of simplicity and\r\nshrewdness more difficult to account for. It may arise naturally in a\r\nmind reared upon a broad and unquestioned basis of belief, free alike\r\nfrom the confusion of mythologies and the distracting details of\r\nuseful knowledge. There is a well-known letter, written to a friend\r\nof Nineveh Layard by a Turkish Cadi, that exactly expresses the finer\r\nside of Mohammedan ignorance. For that reason I quote it in the note\r\nbelow,[43] and when to this disregard of unessential phenomena\r\nin earth and sky is added an indifference to the controversies,\r\nbare facts, and mechanical actions upon which most of us spend our\r\nlives, we may look for a certain simplicity tempered by shrewdness.\r\nThat even in the Nawab, in spite of his Government loan and boasted\r\npowers of design, cookery, and the control of men, I should still\r\nhave been conscious of both those qualities combined, is a remarkable\r\ntestimonial to the influence of Islam.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TEMPLE OF SIKHS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MOHAMMEDAN MOSQUE.\r\n\r\n  [_Face p. 200._\r\n]\r\n\r\nOwing to these pleasant qualities, so attractive to Englishmen sprung\r\nlike myself from the public-school, country-house, and villa classes,\r\nI have almost invariably found English officers and officials on\r\nthe side of the Mohammedans where there is any rivalry of race or\r\nreligion at all. And in Eastern Bengal this national inclination\r\nis now encouraged by the Government’s open resolve to retain the\r\nMohammedan support of the Partition by any means in its power. It was\r\nagainst the Hindus only that all the petty persecution of officialdom\r\nwas directed. It was they who were excluded from Government posts;\r\nit was Hindu schools from which Government patronage was withdrawn.\r\nWhen Mohammedans rioted, the punitive police ransacked Hindu houses,\r\nand companies of little Gurkhas were quartered on Hindu populations.\r\nIt was the Hindus who in one place were forbidden to sit on the river\r\nbank. Of course, the plea was that only the Hindus were opposed to\r\nthe Government’s policy of dividing them from the rest of their race,\r\nso that they alone needed suppression. And certainly, after what I\r\nhad seen in the previous four or five years in Macedonia, Central\r\nAfrica, Russia, and the Caucasus, this kind of persecution might well\r\nappear ludicrously small. But it was the beginning of a dangerous\r\nroad, to which one could not see the end, and the knowledge that our\r\nown country was taking that road aggravated the sense of wrong.\r\n\r\nIt was the same with espionage. Personally I enjoyed being followed\r\nby spies wherever I went. I enjoyed it much more than the spies\r\nthemselves. It was a pleasure to watch the open-hearted stupidity\r\nwhich never left me in doubt as to their purpose, or to look them\r\ntranquilly in the face and see their eyes drop in honourable shame.\r\nIt was a joyful moment when at Serajganj I turned in wrath upon a man\r\nwho had been following me all day long in the melodramatic disguise\r\nof a black shawl and an umbrella, and watched the poor hired worm\r\ngrovel away, murmuring tearful appeals about superior orders. In\r\nthat case I was angry because I was visiting the schools—the same\r\nover which Sir Bampfylde Fuller resigned—and it seemed to me unfit\r\nthat the schoolboys should see our Government’s habit of espionage\r\nthus illustrated before their faces. But at another place where I\r\narrived in the cold of half-past three in the morning, and found that\r\nthe telegram to prepare for my arrival had been detained, there was\r\nno alloy in the pleasure with which I seized upon the spy detailed\r\nto dog me, and compelled him to procure a cart, conduct me to the\r\nhouse where he knew I ought to have been expected, and knock up the\r\nsleeping servants to receive me.\r\n\r\nWhen I first landed in Bombay, it appeared to me a little undignified\r\nthat representatives of the British Government should set police\r\nspies to question a Member of Parliament’s chauffeur every morning\r\nand evening where he was going or had been, and with whom he\r\nhad conversed. Of course it made no difference to the Member of\r\nParliament, any more than the delightful spies in Eastern Bengal made\r\nany difference to me. But what was a joke to us may be anything but\r\na joke to native Indians who are compelled to live permanently under\r\na system of official surveillance which reads their private letters,\r\ndetains their telegrams, and hires men to watch their actions. Far\r\nworse than the mere annoyance involved is the indignant contempt\r\nwhich our Government thus stores up against itself. Every now and\r\nthen by such means it may discover the trail of some seditious\r\nmovement. But the discovery of all the sedition in India would not\r\nbe worth the loss of reputation to which we expose ourselves by\r\nresorting to methods that would exclude a man from any club in our\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThere is something about espionage that stirs indignation more deeply\r\nthan anything else in the world. But I do not wish to part from that\r\nland of great rivers with a mere feeling of bitterness. When I recall\r\nthe quiet circuit of streams by which I slowly passed from Khulna\r\nto Barisal, and on to Dacca; and from Dacca through Mymensingh and\r\nJamalpur and Serajganj and Goalundo, where the Ganges and Brahmaputra\r\nare joined, to Faridpur, where trains run back to Calcutta,—I lose\r\nthe sense of bitterness, though there was plenty in the country.\r\nI think only of the fertile land basking under an uninterrupted\r\nsky, or of bright crowds of men in yellow, red, and white standing\r\nupon the river bank and shouting their “Bande Mataram” against the\r\nsunrise; or of long torchlight processions that conducted some leader\r\nof the nation home in his carriage through the blue night; or of\r\nlittle groups of schoolboys who had stayed on the platform till the\r\ncold of morning to cheer a passing train, delighted even to shiver\r\nfor their country. “I fear we shall never meet again on life’s rough\r\nsea,” said a student at one place, being naturally proud of such\r\nbeautiful English; and, certainly, one cannot hope to visit the\r\nBrahmaputra every week-end. But even from a good month’s distance, as\r\nLondon is, it seems impossible to believe that one petulant error can\r\nfor all time produce division and rancorous hatred in so excellent a\r\ncountry and among a people so devoted to the same causes of freedom\r\nand nationality that we so much admire.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[43] “My illustrious Friend, and Joy of my Liver! The thing you ask\r\nof me is both difficult and useless. Although I have passed all my\r\ndays in this place, I have neither counted the houses nor inquired\r\ninto the number of the inhabitants; and as to what one person loads\r\non his mules and the other stows away in the bottom of his ship, that\r\nis no business of mine. But, above all, as to the previous history of\r\nthis city, God only knows the amount of dirt and confusion that the\r\ninfidels may have eaten before the coming of the sword of Islam. It\r\nwere unprofitable for us to inquire.\r\n\r\n“Oh, my soul! Oh, my lamb! seek not after the things which concern\r\nthee not. Thou camest unto us and we welcomed thee: go in peace.\r\n\r\n“Of a truth, thou hast spoken many words; and there is no harm done,\r\nfor the speaker is one and the listener is another. After the fashion\r\nof thy people thou hast wandered from one place to another, until\r\nthou art happy and content in none. We (praise be to God) were born\r\nhere, and never desire to quit it. Is it possible then that the idea\r\nof a general intercourse between mankind should make any impression\r\non our understanding? God forbid!\r\n\r\n“Listen, O my son! There is no wisdom equal to the belief in God. He\r\ncreated the world, and shall we liken ourselves unto Him in seeking\r\nto penetrate into the mysteries of His creation? Shall we say, behold\r\nthis star spinneth round that star, and this other star with a tail\r\ngoes and comes in so many years? Let it go. He from whose hand it\r\ncame will guide and direct it.\r\n\r\n“But thou wilt say to me, Stand aside, O man, for I am more learned\r\nthan thou art, and have seen more things. If thou thinkest thou art\r\nin this respect better than I am, thou art welcome. I praise God that\r\nI seek not that which I require not. Thou art learned in the things I\r\ncare not for; and as for that which thou hast seen, I defile it. Will\r\nmuch knowledge create thee a double belly, or wilt thou seek Paradise\r\nwith thine eyes?\r\n\r\n“Oh, my friend, if thou wilt be happy, say there is no God but God!\r\nDo not evil and then wilt thou fear neither man nor death; for surely\r\nthine hour will come.\r\n\r\n“The meek in spirit,\r\n\r\n“IMAUM ALI ZADE.”\r\n\r\nLayard’s “Nineveh and Babylon,” p. 663.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHREE BENGALIS AND THE PAPERS\r\n\r\n\r\nAll know the crowded Kalighat on the muddy little branch of the\r\nGanges south of Calcutta. The little temple of the mother Kali stands\r\nclose by, where Hindus keep up an animal sacrifice something similar\r\nto the classic and ancient Jewish rites. Many Europeans enjoy seeing\r\nthe heads of the wretched little goats sliced off by a priest’s sword\r\nwhile the animals are still dripping from a plunge in the sacred\r\ntanks. Many, like myself, have gone with the crowding pilgrims on\r\nfestival Sundays or weekday evenings and watched the people bathing\r\nin the turbid water, and the Brahmans seated in the open portico\r\nreading aloud the wanderings of Rama and breaking into song at the\r\nimpassioned parts. Or we have stood at the narrow entrance till the\r\ndoor of the inmost shrine should open, allowing a glimpse of the\r\ngoddess herself, the Bengal Mother, symbolic of the strange Force in\r\nnature, always moving irresistibly on its way with life and death,\r\nblessing and damnation in its hands. Blue-black she is, with three\r\nstaring, scarlet eyes, one of them in her forehead. In her four\r\narms she holds the signs of happiness and of destruction. One foot\r\nis planted on the body of a man, and from her mouth a golden tongue\r\nprotrudes. Her worshippers tell that in her career of destruction\r\nthrough the universe, she was only stayed by the intervention of\r\nher husband Shiva, who in the semblance of a dead man flung himself\r\nbefore her feet to be trampled on. She is represented pausing in\r\nhorror at the discovery. To put out the tongue is the common gesture\r\nof shame or horror among the Indian women, and if it seems a peculiar\r\nexpression of those emotions, watch an English country servant\r\nwhenever she drops a trayful of your best china on a stony floor, and\r\nshe will almost invariably do the same.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE KALIGHAT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PILGRIMS TO KALI.\r\n\r\n  [_Face p. 206._\r\n]\r\n\r\nHow far this hideous collection of symbols is itself worshipped is\r\nthe problem of all imagery and symbolic art. A priest of Kali, who\r\nhad himself received a religious education in one of our missionary\r\ncolleges, told me that in the hour of prayer he found that the image\r\nhelped him to concentrate his thoughts upon that idea of universal\r\nforce. He admitted that some unlearned worshippers obscurely\r\nconnect a supernatural power with the actual image as it stands;\r\nand the great desire of many to draw near, and even to touch the\r\nrepresentation of the god, seems to prove it, as one may see in all\r\ntemples and churches where symbolism prevails. It is rather strange\r\nthat Indians, with their beautiful sense of colour and design,\r\nshould content themselves with unusually hideous gods; for, grand\r\nas the figure of Buddha in contemplation is, it stands alone in its\r\nbeauty, and now no longer appears in Hindu forms of worship. Yet the\r\nadoration of the Mother Kali, even at the bloodstained Kalighat,\r\ndoes not appear to be more horrible or debasing than the service of\r\nother gods. In divine worship, devotion has never corresponded to\r\nexternal beauty; and as to the blood sacrifice, that custom has been\r\ntoo universal, and is still too recent even in the highest forms of\r\nreligion, to excite horror or disgust, except in the tourists who go\r\nto enjoy the spectacle. It seemed to me that the Kali worship did not\r\nsuggest the violence of bloodshed, still less the common lust that\r\nvisitors are told to associate with it, but rather a certain heat\r\nor fervency that pervades and sometimes obscures the Bengali mind,\r\ntaking the form in some of exaltation, in others of oratory, and now\r\nand then of fluid speech.\r\n\r\nAll know this crowded Kalighat. But turn northward again; pass\r\nthe Lieutenant-Governor’s beautiful Residency at Belvedere;\r\npass the racecourse and polo-grounds, the old Fort where the\r\nCommander-in-Chief has his headquarters, and the Strand where\r\nsteamers smoke on the river and the English drive slowly up and down\r\nin the evening; pass the white Government House where the Viceroy\r\nlives in winter, and the dull streets of English shops where they\r\nsell things that are not quite good enough for England or quite bad\r\nenough for the Colonies; enter the squalid chaos of the Indian city,\r\nso ordinary and colourless compared to Bombay or Madras; pass through\r\nmile after mile of crowded bazaars, and teeming slums, and factories\r\njumbled up with temples;—till at last the buildings begin, as it\r\nwere, to shake themselves loose, green reappears, and when you come\r\nupon the river on your left, it looks almost clean and holy; palms\r\nand other trees grow on the banks, and there is a sense of escape\r\nin the air. There you will find another temple of Kali, spacious,\r\nsilent, and a home of peace.\r\n\r\nUnder a great banyan tree in this temple’s garden a religious teacher\r\nsat for years, and gathered many disciples round him before his\r\ndeath in 1886. He was known as Ramakrishna, but he had the names of\r\nDeva and Paramahamsa as well, and there he sat expounding the things\r\nof the spirit, like other Hindu teachers. But there seems to have\r\nbeen an intensity of conviction about him that attracted unusual\r\ndisciples. Among them was a young Bengali named Norendra Nath Datta,\r\nwho took the more holy name of Vivekananda, and spread his master’s\r\nteaching as far as Oxford and Chicago—cities so seldom associated\r\ntogether in spiritual things. He too has gone from this world\r\nnow—he went in 1902, at the age of forty—but has left a school, a\r\nkind of religion or Church, that proclaims a spiritual Hinduism to\r\nall mankind without limitation of race or nation. Its proper name\r\nis the Ramakrishna Society, but the members are generally called\r\nVedantists, because of their belief in the Vedas as the inspired\r\nguides of man. They abjure images and sacrifice, except of flowers\r\nand fruits, which I have seen them offer as symbols of thanksgiving\r\nand praise to the spirituality of the universe in their bare but\r\nsufficient little temple up a flight of steps. By their belief\r\nin the Vedas they approach the Arya Samaj. But their more modern\r\nadvancement and universality bring them nearer the Brahmo Samaj,\r\nor cultivated Unitarians of Hinduism, whose freedom of life and\r\nsocial intercourse for men and women alike gives a peculiar charm to\r\nIndian society in Calcutta. Small in number themselves, they stand\r\nbetween these two main bodies of religious reformers—believers in the\r\nHindu scriptures, but preachers of a universal religion; free from\r\nthe caste restrictions of travel, marriage, and food, but strongly\r\nnational in their devotion to the country. Just across the river,\r\nfrom that peaceful temple of Kali where their founder sat, they have\r\ntheir little monastery for the training of about thirty Brothers, who\r\ngo out from their pleasant garden to teach all the world, and to save\r\ntheir own Indian people in days of plague and famine.\r\n\r\nIt was in a small circle of these Vedantists that I first met Moti\r\nLal Ghose, one of the most peculiar figures of Calcutta life. He\r\nis not a Vedantist himself, being a special worshipper of Vishnu.\r\nIndeed, he follows the Bengali saint Chaitanya, or, as he prefers to\r\ncall him, the Lord GAURANGA, who proclaimed a purified and emotional\r\nform of Hinduism about the time of Luther, and still has disciples,\r\nespecially among outcasts and downtrodden people, because he promised\r\nthe love of God to all without charity’s limitations to the thrifty\r\nand deserving. But devoted Vaishnava as Moti Lal is, one would think\r\nhis guiding faith was a sort of clanship or family affection. They\r\nsay a hundred relations make their home in his rambling household\r\namong the little streets of the Bagh Bazar, and that number would be\r\ndistracting enough for the most placid of mankind, which Moti Lal is\r\nnot. Almost every one seems to be Moti Lal’s relation, and as, like\r\nmany Hindus, he speaks of his cousins as brothers, and his nephews\r\nas sons, the bonds of kinship seem as close as they are wide. But\r\nthe affection of his heart is reserved for his real born brother,\r\nShishir Kumar, who now has waved adieu to this carnal world and\r\nlives in religious seclusion at Baidianath, a far-famed shrine of\r\nCentral Bengal, communing with spirits whose visitations among men he\r\nchronicles in the _Hindu Spiritual Magazine_.\r\n\r\nBoth the brothers were brought up in the district of Jessore,\r\nand they made their mother’s village famous by taking its name\r\nof Amrita Bazar for the title of their paper, the _Amrita Bazar\r\nPatrika_—_Amrita News_, as we should say. It so happens that the word\r\n“Amrita” in Bengali means both “nectar” and “poison,” and no name\r\ncould have been invented to express the character of their paper more\r\nexactly, for it can be sweet or venomous at pleasure, and is usually\r\nboth. Its quickness and satiric power have won it a unique place\r\namong Indian newspapers. It has also a good service of news, and as\r\nfor enterprise, when Lord Lytton passed his Vernacular Press Act in\r\nthe ’seventies, while Sir Ashley Eden was Lieutenant-Governor of\r\nBengal, the _Amrita_ changed its language from the vernacular Bengali\r\nto the alien English in its very next issue. Such a transformation\r\nwould have seemed impossible, if I had not seen the compositors in\r\nMadras setting up my “copy” with hardly a mistake, though they did\r\nnot understand a word of English, and only guessed our letters by\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nMoti Lal is an oldish man now, as Bengalis go, but he stands thin\r\nand erect, his mass of grey hair surmounting a face in which pathos,\r\nhumour, and subtlety are strongly mingled. It is difficult to class\r\nhim among the Indian parties. He often runs off on side issues, such\r\nas his peculiar and personal indignation at the rational proposal\r\nto separate the large and extraneous province of Behar from the\r\nCalcutta government, so as to relieve the pressure of work which was\r\nthe nominal excuse for the Partition of Bengal. On most of the wider\r\nquestions of policy he would take a fairly steady “Congress” line,\r\nwith a tendency to the Left or Extremist position. But that tendency\r\nmay be suddenly interrupted by some queer cross-current, such as a\r\npersonal devotion to the Royal Family, because he was once introduced\r\nto the Prince of Wales, and kissed his feet with a veneration that\r\nmight abash even Royalty’s sense of Divine Right. By means of his\r\npaper he is undoubtedly a power among the party of nationality and\r\nreform, but the general belief that in the past he has exercised a\r\ncertain influence even upon British officials is perhaps justified.\r\nAt all events, when he asked me to remind the Lieutenant-Governor\r\nof a promise to restore the Road Cess to its proper purpose of\r\nsanitation, I noticed that the petition was received in a friendly\r\nspirit, and I was instructed to tell Moti Lal that the proposal had\r\nnot been forgotten, but was already embodied in a Bill.\r\n\r\nSanitation is one of those side issues which he follows with\r\npeculiar zeal. Poverty and high prices, he says, are killing out\r\nthe educated classes in Bengal. But worse than the disappearance\r\nof educated Bengalis, which many Anglo-Indians would regard as a\r\nmercy of Providence, is the general ravage of malaria, plague, and\r\nfamine. The plague is still new, famine has been unusually frequent\r\nand terrible in the last thirty years; but worse than either, in\r\nhis opinion, is the malaria which rots the country away. Like many\r\nIndians he attributes the growth of the disease to the Government\r\nrailways, which have blocked or diverted the natural drainage of the\r\nland. The theory sounds a little fantastic. To me it seems a far more\r\nserious matter that the irrigation, which is often so lucrative, both\r\nto the peasant and the Government, should be accompanied by increase\r\nof fever. But whatever evil may arise in India, from a cesspool to\r\na famine, is put down to the Government, as always happens when the\r\npeople have no control over its powers and no experience of every\r\nGovernment’s limitations. “There is no need to talk about driving the\r\nEnglish from India,” cried Moti Lal to me once: “In twenty years they\r\nwill be driven out by the stench of our rotting corpses!”\r\n\r\nHumorous, sarcastic, vehement, probably a little peevish, a little\r\nuncertain and unstable in his dealings with men and things, Moti\r\nLal moves as a strange and isolated figure in Indian life. He is\r\nageing and rather feeble now; when I asked him if he was going to the\r\nCongress at Surat, he answered, “No, I cannot afford to die.” But\r\nhe went all the same. I suppose he might be called a Congress man,\r\nbut it seems unlikely that any one ever thought of him as a possible\r\nPresident, or as anything else except the bitter-sweet editor of the\r\n_Amrita Bazar Patrika_.\r\n\r\nVery different is the editor of the other leading Indian daily in\r\nCalcutta. Mr. Banerjea, whom every one calls Surendra Nath, is just\r\nthe ideal of a leader in Congress, and Poona made him President in\r\n1895, Ahmedabad in 1902. He appears to be about sixty now, and in\r\nthe early ’seventies he was an assistant magistrate in the Indian\r\nCivil Service, from which he was dismissed for a casual neglect of\r\nduty that in the opinion of many English Civilians might have been\r\nsuitably punished with a sharp reprimand. Like most highly educated\r\npeople out of work, he took to teaching, lecturing, and journalism;\r\nbecame Principal of Ripon College for the training of Hindu boys,\r\nas he still is; was appointed editor of the _Bengalee_ by the\r\nproprietors, who, I believe, are Indian physicians; and has for many\r\nyears maintained it in its position as the most prominent Indian\r\npaper written in English.\r\n\r\nFrom early days, when he was the first to originate tours of\r\npolitical instruction, his influence has been very powerful, and no\r\none has opposed the partition of his country with greater vehemence\r\nand persistency. In politics he has shown himself the fighting man\r\nrather than the thinker, a better leader than guide. Such theory\r\nas he has professed holds him to the Moderate and Constitutional\r\nparty, and till it comes to action he would cordially accept the\r\npropositions of all reasonable and practical reformers. But his\r\ninstincts might carry him further than his creed, and in a moment of\r\ncrisis he would probably be found in the front almost out of sight of\r\nhis party. No matter how strongly reason and expediency disapproved,\r\nhe would be reluctant to hang back from any extreme position, or\r\nto leave a devoted band of defenders there alone. That appeared to\r\nmark him out as the best intermediary between the Extremists and\r\nthe Centre; for, while neither party would look to him for definite\r\npolitical guidance, both might be supposed to know that he was at\r\nheart their friend, and both could point to his past services in\r\nthe Bengal Legislative Council, the University Senate, and the old\r\nCalcutta Corporation, before Lord Curzon destroyed it.\r\n\r\nThe same kind of divergence between reason and personality causes,\r\nI believe, an uncertain attitude towards other affairs of life.\r\nBy education and habit he is Western in the things of society and\r\nreligion, and probably would have remained so without scruple of\r\nconscience, but for the recent revolt against everything foreign.\r\nAmong the Extremists there is a kind of conservative reaction towards\r\nIndian ways and Indian religion, prompted not so much by love of\r\nthose early marriages and Hindu gods as by the determination to\r\ntolerate European things no more. Thus, you might find an Indian\r\ngraduate of Oxford worshipping Kali for the same reason as makes him\r\nbuy Swadeshi cotton, or pledging his infant daughter in marriage for\r\nfear she should grow up like an English lady. From patriotism of this\r\nsort Surendra Nath would not like to stand aloof, and, even if his\r\njudgment hesitated, an impetuous nature would perhaps bear him on,\r\nespecially if he could thus assist his associates of the moment.\r\n\r\nBut his real function in life is as an orator, and his eminence has\r\nbeen won by an extraordinary power of speaking. I do not know how\r\nfar his speeches in his own tongue might be effective, but he served\r\nhis political apprenticeship at a time when oratory was tested by\r\na knowledge of English, and I think he always speaks by choice in\r\nour language. Certainly, his command over it is very remarkable.\r\nExcept for Mr. Gladstone, I have heard no speakers use the grand\r\nand rhetorical style of English with more assurance and success. I\r\nremember one afternoon there was a crowded meeting of many thousand\r\nstudents and other young men in the great College Square at Calcutta.\r\nThere they stood, white-robed, bare-headed, as is the Bengali\r\ncustom, and when the “Bande Mataram” had been sung, Surendra Nath\r\nrose. It was not a specially important speech. His object was only\r\nto sketch out the general programme of the approaching Congress,\r\nand to urge all parties to unite for the credit of their country,\r\nwhich was being watched by jealous eyes ever ready to detect the\r\nfirst appearance of a flaw. That was all his theme, but he expounded\r\nit with a magnificence of phrase, and continuity of expression\r\nthat held me in wonder. Sentence answered to sentence, period to\r\nperiod, thunder to thunder. There was no hesitation, no throwing\r\nback, no wandering for ideas or words. Out the great language\r\nrolled without a break and without a drop, each syllable in its\r\nexact place and order, each sentence following some cadence of its\r\nown, so inevitable that you could foretell the stress and rhythm of\r\nits rise and fall far in advance of the actual words, just as you\r\ncan in Macaulay’s declamations. It was oratory such as, I suppose,\r\nCicero loved to practise, and Pitt, and Brougham—such oratory as\r\nfew living Englishmen dare venture on for fear of drowning in the\r\ngulfs of bathos. But Surendra Nath loved it, as Cicero might. To him\r\nit was evidently the sincerest pleasure of life to listen to the\r\nbeat of marching phrases, to advance from one to another with the\r\nassurance that not one of them would fail, and to lead them out in\r\nthe martialled order of earth-shaking battalions moving shoulder to\r\nshoulder on their front. It was to him the fulfilment of function,\r\nand that way happiness lies. After him I spoke, and the meeting ended.\r\n\r\nThat evening I went to see a Bengali of still another type, but as\r\ndistinctive of the present crisis in the country as the satirist\r\nor the orator. It had been arranged, as I supposed, that I should\r\nmeet some representatives of the young Nationalist party which form\r\nthe staff of _Bande Mataram_, a daily paper written in English\r\nand maintaining Extremist views, but trying rather carefully to\r\nkeep within the law. In that respect it differed from the farthing\r\npaper, _Sandhya_ (“Evening”), written in Bengali of the roughest\r\npopular dialect, and deliberately going all lengths in virulence and\r\nabuse. That had been the policy of its founder and editor, Pundit\r\nUpadhya Brahmabandhab, who had died a few months before while under\r\ntrial for sedition. One of the Brahmo Samaj by training, he had\r\ntravelled much in Europe, had lectured in Cambridge, tried to become\r\na Roman Catholic but failed (so rare a failure!) and on returning\r\nto Calcutta had startled the reformers of the Congress party by\r\na light-hearted violence that must have ended in gaol, had not\r\ndeath anticipated imprisonment by release. In the same way _Bande\r\nMataram_ differed from the vernacular weekly _Yugantar_ (“New Age”\r\nor “New Dispensation”), a revolutionary paper of a more gloomy and\r\nsolemn type than the _Sandhya_, but about equally open to charges of\r\nsedition, to meet which it kept a staff of “prison editors” always\r\nready for the next prosecution. The first of them to go to gaol was\r\nthe youth Bupendra Nath Datta, a brother of the Swami Vivekananda,\r\nwho followed Ramakrishna. In the early summer of 1908 it was\r\nprosecuted for the fifth time, its printer was fined about £67, and\r\nsent to hard labour for twenty-three months, and after Lord Minto’s\r\nnew Press Act of June, 1908, it stopped regular circulation.\r\n\r\nMr. Arabindo Ghose was almost certainly not connected with the\r\n_Yugantar_, but nobody seriously denied his connection with the\r\nEnglish-written _Bande Mataram_, though that paper also had a staff\r\nof volunteers for prison.[44] When I reached the house in a large\r\nsquare where the meeting was to have been held, I found it dark\r\nand apparently empty. A Hindu servant let me in, and after a time\r\nMr. Arabindo Ghose himself appeared alone. He had not expected me,\r\nbecause the letter about my coming had been stopped, no doubt by\r\nthe postal spies, as he said nearly all his letters were. He had no\r\nspecial reason to complain of that, nor did he complain; for the\r\nletters from one of the most respected public men in England to a\r\nmember of the Viceroy’s Council had recently been opened in Bombay,\r\nand English people who were friendly with Indians in Calcutta told me\r\neven their letters from home were tampered with in the same way.\r\n\r\nHe was a youngish man, I should think still under thirty. Intent\r\ndark eyes looked from his thin, clear-cut face with a gravity that\r\nseemed immovable, but the figure and bearing were those of an\r\nEnglish graduate. His parents had been half-anglicized, and had\r\nnever fully taught him his own language, so that he could not write\r\nBengali correctly, or make a speech in the only tongue, as he said,\r\nthat really went to the heart of the people. He had brought himself\r\nup amid poverty in Manchester, St. Paul’s School in London, and at\r\nCambridge. Though he passed the Indian Civil Service examinations\r\nwithin the first two or three, he failed to pass the riding test, and\r\nwas rejected. Having served the Gaekwar of Baroda for a time in the\r\neducation of that progressive State, he came to Calcutta, and was now\r\nthe leader of the Nationalists, or young Extremists who regarded even\r\nMr. Tilak as touched with the cautious moderation of the past. One of\r\nhis brothers, a poet of some standing in English, was Professor of\r\nEnglish Literature at the Presidency College in Calcutta University,\r\nand I found him there teaching the grammar and occasional beauties of\r\nTennyson’s “Princess,” with extreme distaste for that sugary stuff.\r\nAnother brother was supposed to belong to a different branch of the\r\nExtremists.\r\n\r\nArabindo’s purpose, as he explained it to me, was the Irish policy of\r\nSinn Fein—a universal Swadeshi, not limited to goods but including\r\nevery phase of life. His Nationalists would let the Government go its\r\nway and take no notice of it at all. They hoped nothing from reforms;\r\nall the talk about Legislative Councils and Indian members and\r\nthe separation of Judicial and Executive functions was meaningless\r\nto them. They did not spend a thought upon it. In fact, the worse\r\nthe Government was, the more repressive it became, and the less it\r\ninclined to reform, so much the better for the Nationalist cause. He\r\nregarded the Partition of Bengal as the greatest blessing that had\r\never happened to India. No other measure could have stirred national\r\nfeeling so deeply or roused it so suddenly from the lethargy of\r\nprevious years.\r\n\r\n“Since 1830,” he said, “each generation had reduced us more and more\r\nto the condition of sheep and fatted calves.”\r\n\r\nHe lamented the long peace, leading to degeneracy and effeminate\r\nways. Under it the ordinary people had sought only after prosperity\r\nand material comfort, while the thoughtful men spent their time in\r\næsthetic circles, admiring Shelley and Swinburne, or imitating them.\r\nThe more English a man was, the more he counted himself successful,\r\nand the life-blood of nationality had run thin. But all this torpor\r\nand smug contentment had been rudely interrupted by the disguised\r\nblessings of Lord Curzon’s errors. Indignation had again created\r\npatriotism when apparently it was dead, and the new party’s whole\r\npolicy was aimed at carrying forward the work that Lord Curzon\r\nhad so successfully begun for the revival of national character\r\nand spirit. For this purpose of building up a race worthy of a\r\ngreat name they proposed to work on the three lines of a national\r\neducation, independent of Government but including the methods of\r\nEuropean science; a national industry, with boycott of all foreign\r\ngoods except the few things that India could not produce; and the\r\nencouragement of private arbitration, in place of the law-courts, for\r\nthe settlement of disputes.\r\n\r\nBut behind these simple means a deeper spirit was at work. Arabindo\r\nGhose had already, I think, formed the project of developing out\r\nof the Congress, or in place of the Congress, a nationalist and\r\ndemocratic body that would prepare the country for self-government\r\nand, indeed, act within limits as a true Indian Parliament quite\r\napart from the Anglo-Indian system. A few weeks later, a leading\r\narticle on the subject, probably written by Arabindo himself,\r\nappeared in _Bande Mataram_—\r\n\r\n  “Let us try the experiment,” it said, “of a self-governing popular\r\n  assembly, so far as is consistent with the existence of an alien\r\n  bureaucracy seeking to restrict our independent activities in every\r\n  possible way. No growth is possible under perpetual tutelage. We\r\n  must devise means for stimulating activities on the part of our\r\n  people. This cannot be better done than by organizing a really\r\n  representative assembly that in its annual or periodic sittings\r\n  will decide on our course of action. It does not necessarily follow\r\n  that such an assembly will come into collision with the powers that\r\n  be. We have every right to organize ourselves independently. The\r\n  agitators have so long been taunted with absolute dependence on\r\n  the bureaucracy that people cannot reasonably try to repress an\r\n  assembly for the offence of carrying out their own precepts....\r\n  As they cannot see their way to giving us any real voice in the\r\n  administration, even in a dim and distant future, we have no other\r\n  course open to us. Let us relieve the bureaucratic administration\r\n  of as much of its duties as we can by undertaking to govern\r\n  ourselves in as many departments as possible.”[45]\r\n\r\nCourage, he rightly saw, was the first thing to maintain or to create\r\nin any people, especially in a subject people like the Bengalis, who\r\nhad so long been taunted with cowardice by one master after another.\r\nThe taunt of cowardice is like one of those prophecies that fulfil\r\nthemselves. It implants the cowardice that it derides, and if you\r\ncall a people timid they begin to shake. Ever since Macaulay wrote,\r\nthe Anglo-Indians had been brought up by their schools and coaches\r\nto regard the Bengalis as the cowards of the world, and what was far\r\nworse, the educated Bengalis had been taught to regard themselves as\r\nthe cowards of the world too, just because Macaulay had delighted\r\nhimself one morning with a brilliant passage of rhetoric.[46]\r\n\r\nWhere the consciousness of timidity exists among a people, the first\r\nduty of a patriot is to remove it at all costs. So in the columns\r\nof his paper and in his rare speeches Arabindo Ghose was insisting\r\nespecially on the necessity of courage:—\r\n\r\n  “Courage,” said a leader in _Bande Mataram_, “is your principal\r\n  asset. Heroism, says Emerson, feels and never reasons, and\r\n  therefore is always right. If you are to work out the salvation\r\n  of your country, you will have to do it with heroism. You have\r\n  voluntarily cut yourselves off from outside help to develop\r\n  strength from within. Darkness will hem you round, disappointments\r\n  will cross your path, slander will pursue you from behind, but you\r\n  are to depend on yourselves, and yourselves alone. You must press\r\n  on and not allow yourselves to be dragged back by encumbrances in\r\n  the name of unity. You have your only guide in the loftiness and\r\n  spirituality that make their heaven in the thought of the wider\r\n  light and purer happiness that you may bring to your country by\r\n  long force of vision and endeavour. The rapturous contemplation\r\n  of a new and better state for your country is your only hope. What\r\n  great element is wanting in a life guided by such a hope?”[47]\r\n\r\nThere is a religious tone, a spiritual elevation, in such words\r\nvery characteristic of Arabindo Ghose himself, and of all Bengali\r\nNationalists, contrasted with the shrewd political judgment of Poona\r\nExtremists. In an age of supernatural religion Arabindo would have\r\nbecome what the irreligious mean by a fanatic. He was possessed by\r\nthat concentrated vision, that limited and absorbing devotion. Like a\r\nhorse in blinkers, he ran straight, regardless of everything except\r\nthe narrow bit of road in front. But at the end of that road he saw a\r\nvision more inspiring and spiritual than any fanatic saw who rushed\r\non death with Paradise in sight. Nationalism to him was far more than\r\na political object or a means of material improvement. To him it was\r\nsurrounded by a mist of glory, the halo that mediæval saints beheld\r\ngleaming around the head of martyrs. Grave with intensity, careless\r\nof fate or opinion, and one of the most silent men I have known, he\r\nwas of the stuff that dreamers are made of, but dreamers who will act\r\ntheir dream, indifferent to the means. “Nationalism,” he said, in a\r\nbrief address delivered in Bombay, early in 1908—“Nationalism is a\r\nreligion that comes from God”:—\r\n\r\n  “Nationalism cannot die, because it is God who is working in\r\n  Bengal. God cannot be killed, God cannot be sent to gaol. Have\r\n  you got a real faith, or is it merely a political inspiration,\r\n  a larger kind of selfishness?... You all know what Bengal used\r\n  to be; you all know that the name of Bengali used to be a term\r\n  of reproach among nations. What has happened? What has made the\r\n  Bengali so different from his old self? One thing has happened,\r\n  Bengal is learning to believe. Bengal was once drunk with the wine\r\n  of European civilization, and with the purely intellectual teaching\r\n  that it received from the West. It began to see all things, to\r\n  judge all things, through the imperfect instrumentality of the\r\n  intellect. When this was so, Bengal became a land of doubters and\r\n  cynics....\r\n\r\n  “The intellect, having nothing more to offer save despair, became\r\n  quiescent, and when the intellect ceased to work, the heart of\r\n  Bengal was open and ready to receive the voice of God whenever he\r\n  should speak. When the message came at last, Bengal was ready to\r\n  receive it, and she received it in a single moment. In a single\r\n  moment the whole nation rose, the whole nation lifted itself out\r\n  of despair, and it was by this sudden awakening from a dream that\r\n  Bengal found the way of salvation, and declared to all India that\r\n  eternal life, immortality, not lasting degradation, was our fate....\r\n\r\n  “There came a time, after the first outbreak of triumphant hope,\r\n  when all the material forces that could be brought to bear against\r\n  Nationalism were gradually brought into play, and the question was\r\n  asked of Bengal, ‘Can you suffer? Can you survive?’ The young men\r\n  of Bengal were now called upon to suffer. They were called upon to\r\n  bear the crown, not of victory, but of martyrdom....\r\n\r\n  “It is not by any mere political programme, not by National\r\n  Education alone, not by Swadeshi alone, not by boycott, that\r\n  this country can be saved. Swadeshi by itself might merely lead\r\n  to a little more material prosperity, and you might forget the\r\n  real thing you sought to do, in the glamour of wealth and in the\r\n  desire to keep it safe. In other subject countries also there was\r\n  material development.... When the hour of trial came, it was found\r\n  that those nations which had been developing materially were not\r\n  alive.... The forces of the country are other than visible forces.\r\n  There is only one force, and for that force I am not necessary, you\r\n  are not necessary, he is not necessary. Let us all be thrown aside\r\n  as so much waste substance, the country will not suffer. God is\r\n  doing everything. When He throws us away, He does so because we are\r\n  no longer required. But He is immortal in the hearts of His people.”\r\n\r\nThis fervour of nationality, which some would call fanaticism,\r\ncertainly appears to differ in degree from the religious fervour\r\nwith which we pray for the High Court of Parliament, “under our most\r\nreligious and gracious King at this time assembled.” But it would be\r\nno compliment to ourselves to doubt that at the back of both there is\r\na unity of spirit.[48]\r\n\r\nAs to fanaticism of language and the violence that cannot keep\r\noutside the limits of sedition, I have seen violent and bloodthirsty\r\npassages translated from the _Yugantar_, the _Sandhya_, the\r\n_Hitaishi_ (“Friend”) of Barisal, and other vernacular papers. Such\r\npapers are fined, suppressed, have editors imprisoned, and under\r\nthe new Press Act may have their type confiscated. But in none of\r\nthem have I seen more deliberate attempts to stir up race hatred and\r\nincite to violence than in Anglo-Indian papers which suffer nothing.\r\nTake, for instance, this obvious instigation to indiscriminate\r\nmanslaughter by the _Asian_, an Anglo-Indian weekly in Calcutta (May\r\n9, 1908):—\r\n\r\n  “Mr. Kingsford has a great opportunity, and we hope he is a fairly\r\n  decent shot at short range. We recommend to his notice a Mauser\r\n  pistol, with the nickel filed off the nose of the bullets, or\r\n  a Colt’s automatic, which carries a heavy soft bullet and is a\r\n  hard-hitting and punishing weapon. We hope Mr. Kingsford will\r\n  manage to secure a big ‘bag,’ and we envy him his opportunity.\r\n  He will be more than justified in letting daylight into every\r\n  strange native approaching his house or his person, and for his\r\n  own sake we trust he will learn to shoot fairly straight without\r\n  taking his weapon out of his coat pocket. It saves time and gives\r\n  the elevation fairly correctly at any distance up to about ten or\r\n  fifteen yards. We wish the one man who has shown that he has a\r\n  correct view of the necessities of the situation the very best of\r\n  luck.”\r\n\r\nThat was written certainly at a time of great excitement, when an\r\nattempt had been made to assassinate the unpopular magistrate by a\r\nbomb, which killed two ladies, not only innocent, but related to one\r\nof those exceptional men whose sympathy with the people makes them\r\njustly beloved. But two can play at the evil game of race hatred,\r\nand if the Indian press is violent, the tone of the Anglo-Indian\r\npress is almost invariably insolent and provocative. If “seditious”\r\nonly means “likely to lead to violence,” it is seditious too. There\r\nare fine exceptions, like the _Statesman_, the _Indian Daily News_,\r\nthe _Empire_, and _Capital_, in Calcutta. Steadily supporting the\r\nofficial side, though with great freedom of criticism, as was shown\r\nin the case of Lord Curzon, the _Pioneer_ of Allahabad maintains\r\nan honourable tradition. But as to Anglo-Indian papers like the\r\n_Englishman_ of Calcutta and the _Civil and Military Gazette_ of\r\nLahore, it must have been difficult for any thoughtful Indian who\r\nloved his country to read them during 1907 without cursing our race.\r\nEven the _Times of India_, the best paper in Bombay, greeted Mr. Keir\r\nHardie’s arrival in the city with a whole column of insults, not only\r\nto the Labour leader, but to the Indian people. Judging from the\r\nstyle, I thought the editor must have bribed some poor, half-educated\r\nIndian to do the thing for him; but I heard afterwards, through one\r\nof the staff, that it was written by an Anglo-Indian, who was quite\r\nproud of his achievement. What cause he had for pride may be seen\r\nfrom a paragraph or two:—\r\n\r\n  “Mr. Keir Hardie’s reception in Bombay was thoroughly in keeping\r\n  with the rest of his experiences, and foolishly ebullient\r\n  proceedings. All along the mountains have been in labour; to the\r\n  disappointment of excited and expectant Babudom the mighty throes\r\n  have never produced more than here and there the proverbial mouse.\r\n  Fifty Hindus, and a couple of Parsis: what a deputation from the\r\n  wealthiest and most progressive commercial city of the East, what\r\n  a characteristic greeting from the great heart of Indian labour to\r\n  the personification of the political labourite spirit! Even this\r\n  bathotic manifestation of the deplorable fact that the Oriental is\r\n  almost entirely devoid of humour, as completely so as the labouring\r\n  man and his chosen apostle, must needs miscarry. The fifty Hindu\r\n  schoolboys and their two Parsi companions cannot find the god of\r\n  their idolatry. Perchance he sleepeth, and cannot hear, or will not\r\n  hear the piping yell of ‘Bande Mataram’; at any rate look where\r\n  they will in the compartments commonly occupied by their beloved\r\n  agitators and demagogues, not a sign of this one is to be found.\r\n  Topknots and draperies flying wildly to the winds, they race up\r\n  and down chattering discordantly, baffled, desperate till at last,\r\n  ‘proh pudor,’ they find him, not occupied in great meditations,\r\n  not even spouting platitudes to the circumambient air, but\r\n  prosaically strapping up his exiguous baggage, in a second-class\r\n  compartment. ‘Cophinus foenumque supellex.’ A damper this and no\r\n  mistake. Deputation from the dumb millions of India brimming over\r\n  with enthusiasm and verbosity, subconsciously dominated by the\r\n  traditional respect of the East for superior men, men to be looked\r\n  up to, men on the summits, what to say to this essentially and\r\n  markedly labelled second-class product!...\r\n\r\n  “Does it not occur to this man of the people, uncultured,\r\n  illiterate, with at the best a stunted and perverted imagination,\r\n  does it not occur to him, and the astuter ones who are making\r\n  him their cat’s-paw, that his enterprise is not only radically\r\n  mischievous but overwhelmingly ridiculous? The appeal from masses\r\n  to masses, the slogan of gutter to gutter, cementing all the forces\r\n  of inferiority, inefficiency, and serfdom, preludes war against\r\n  all that is best and sanest and strongest in life. It is the\r\n  voiced concentration of hatred, the hatred which the sick and the\r\n  feeble and the bad by some strange law of antagonism cannot help\r\n  cherishing against the healthy, the great and the good. On the one\r\n  hand Aristocracy, the rule of the best, on the other Democracy, the\r\n  rule of the mob, that ‘bellua centiceps’ representing again by the\r\n  inexorable laws of nature what for the time being is the worst.”[49]\r\n\r\nAnd for the time being we certainly need not look, even from\r\nDemocracy, for anything worse than that!\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[44] For Bepin Chandra Pal’s action during a prosecution of the\r\n_Bande Mataram_, see Introduction, p. 23.\r\n\r\n[45] _Bande Mataram_, January 21, 1908.\r\n\r\n[46] As Macaulay is no longer thought generally necessary to\r\neducation, it may be worth while to recall a few sentences of his\r\nindictment of a whole people nearly twice as numerous as his own. The\r\npassage comes in his essay on Warren Hastings: “A war of Bengalis\r\nagainst Englishmen was like a war of sheep against wolves, of men\r\nagainst demons.... The physical organization of the Bengali is\r\nfeeble even to effeminacy. He lives in a constant vapour bath. His\r\npursuits are sedentary, his limbs delicate, his movements languid.\r\nDuring many ages he has been trampled upon by men of bolder and more\r\nhardy breeds. Courage, independence, veracity, are qualities to\r\nwhich his constitution and his situations are equally unfavourable.\r\nHis mind bears a singular analogy to his body. It is weak even to\r\nhelplessness, for purposes of manly resistance; but its suppleness\r\nand its tact move the children of sterner climates to admiration\r\nnot unmingled with contempt. All those arts which are the natural\r\ndefence of the weak are more familiar to this subtle race than to the\r\nIonian of the time of Juvenal, or to the Jew of the dark ages. What\r\nthe horns are to the buffalo, what the paw is to the tiger, what the\r\nsting is to the bee, what beauty, according to the old Greek song,\r\nis to woman, deceit is to the Bengali.” And so on, for many more\r\nsentences of nicely balanced rhetoric.\r\n\r\n[47] _Bande Mataram_, January 22, 1908.\r\n\r\n[48] On May 3, 1908, Mr. Arabindo Ghose was arrested on the charge of\r\nbeing implicated in a conspiracy to provide rifles and dynamite for\r\nrevolutionary purposes.\r\n\r\n[49] _The Times of India_, October 26, 1907.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nA MAHRATTA SHOE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was roses, roses all the way—almost all the way during the\r\nforty-four hours in the train from Calcutta to Surat; and along the\r\nlast part of our journey every platform was crowded with eager,\r\nsmiling faces straining to catch sight of the future President of the\r\nCongress, and the long-trusted leaders who accompanied him. Dr. Rash\r\nBehari Ghose had been designated President by the Reception Committee\r\nat Surat, in spite of stormy opposition in favour of Mr. Tilak at\r\na conference in Nagpur some two months earlier, and the subsequent\r\nproposal of Lajpat Rai by Mr. Tilak himself. He stood smiling at\r\nthe carriage door, and answered with short speeches of thanks\r\nand encouragement. Or he walked the platform, and sat at station\r\ntea-tables while old men and youths hung long garlands of marigolds\r\nand jasmine round his neck, presented him with bright bouquets of\r\nflowers sparkling with “fairy rain,” or sprinkled his coat and hands\r\nwith Swadeshi scents from long silver bottles. Others were with\r\nhim—Mr. Surendra Nath Banerjea, the orator, Mr. Aswini Kumar Dutt,\r\nthe leader of Barisal, members of the Chaudhuri family conspicuous\r\nin Calcutta, and many other well-known men who for years past had\r\ntried to carry on the work of constitutional reform in the face of\r\nAnglo-Indian ridicule, contempt, and hatred. A few younger men were\r\nthere also, men of another party, who had abandoned appeals and\r\npetitions either to Anglo-Indian or British justice.\r\n\r\nBut the chief attention was centred on Dr. Ghose—Rash Behari,\r\nas people called him—a large, spectacled man of sixty-two, with\r\nstrongly marked face and the general look and bearing of a European\r\njudge. From his student days at the Presidency College in Calcutta\r\nhe had devoted himself to the law. He obtained the highest honours\r\nthe University gives, he lectured in law, he produced the standard\r\nwork on the “Law of Mortgage in India.” I suppose he was exactly\r\nwhat people mean by a jurist. He prided himself also on a minute\r\nacquaintance with the whole range of the English classics, and it is\r\nalmost impossible to read a page of his speeches without coming upon\r\nmemories of some great passage in our literature. For he belonged to\r\nthe time when education and capacity were estimated by a knowledge\r\nof English, and he had besides a genuine delight in the form and\r\nsubstance of words. But civil law was his life’s business, and in\r\nthe knowledge of it he was called unrivalled.\r\n\r\nHe had taken to public politics late, only when the pressure of\r\nGovernment upon the growing national feeling appeared to him\r\ndangerous. But the weight of his knowledge, and his influence as one\r\nof the representative Indian members on the Viceroy’s Legislative\r\nCouncil brought him quickly into notice, and in the previous December\r\n(1906) Calcutta had chosen him Chairman of the Reception Committee\r\nfor the Congress, to which Dadabhai Naoroji had been brought from\r\nEngland as President to preserve the peace. Like all lawyers, he\r\ntended to moderation. He represented the spirit of the Congress as\r\nit had been established for more than twenty years—the spirit that\r\nhad begun by hoping to win even Anglo-Indian consideration for its\r\nprogramme of reform, and, after abandoning that hope, still did not\r\ndespair of influencing opinion in England, if only petitions and\r\nproposals could be heard.\r\n\r\nHis danger was the danger of all students—of all whose life is\r\nspent among writings that usually appeal to reason, and not among\r\nmen, with whom reason plays so small a part. When it comes to\r\naction, such students are likely either to distrust themselves, to\r\nhesitate between opposite courses, in both of which they perceive\r\nadvantages, and in hesitation finally to submit their wills to far\r\ninferior intellects, out of a kind of awe towards men who have\r\nreally done something. Or else they may show a childish impatience\r\nat disagreement, and suppose they have settled a controversy by\r\nending it, like shutting a book with a bang. I thought the judicial\r\nhesitancy rather than impatience would be Dr. Ghose’s temptation, but\r\nI was wrong, for he had, in fact, recently displayed a very decisive\r\nvigour in joining with Mr. Gokhale in denouncing the Seditious\r\nMeetings Bill on the Viceroy’s Council.[50]\r\n\r\nSo amid acclamation they travelled to the Congress—the\r\nPresident-Elect and the other leaders.\r\n\r\nOn Christmas Day Surat was reached at last—a little old town on the\r\nwest coast, between Baroda and Bombay, where early traders from\r\nEngland, France, Portugal, and Holland had built their “Factories,”\r\nsoon after Akbar’s death. The crowd round the station was so tightly\r\njammed that it was a long time before any one could leave the train.\r\n\r\nBy reasoning and entreaty the youthful bands of “Volunteers” in\r\nkhaki and forage caps at last cleared a space. A procession of\r\ncarriages was formed and began to advance step by step through the\r\nshouting throngs of orange, crimson, and white-clad people. All the\r\nwindows and tottering balconies of the beautiful but decrepit city\r\nthat starves upon its past—even the galleries of Islam’s crumbling\r\nminarets and the roofs of Hindu temples—were crammed with faces.\r\nWomen peeped through shutters or stood shamelessly beside their\r\nchildren and brothers. Boys and girls thrust their heads through\r\nholes in the ruinous walls. At every few yards more garlands were\r\noffered, more bunches of flowers and sweet-smelling seeds. Thick fell\r\nthe showers of rose-water sprayed from silver bottles. On every side\r\nrose the great cheer of “Bande Mataram!” From end to end the streets\r\nwere hung with strings of pink and yellow paper flags, and here and\r\nthere a triumphal arch uttered the universal welcome in Indian or\r\nEnglish words. The great Pandal, or Pavilion, for the Congress, and\r\nthe camp of tents pitched around it for the delegates from all India\r\nstood by the river side beyond the town itself. The distance was not\r\nmuch over two miles, and yet that journey took more than two hours to\r\naccomplish, so high ran the enthusiasm of joy.\r\n\r\nBut, behind the shouting and the triumph, one heard the quiet voice\r\nthat whispers of mortality. In the grey light of Christmas morning,\r\nas we came through some obscure junction in the train, we had heard\r\nthat Mr. Allen, the collector of Dacca, had been shot on the platform\r\nat Goalundo in Eastern Bengal, and his life was despaired of. Mr.\r\nAllen did in the end recover, but at the time recovery was said to be\r\nimpossible, and the news threw the same gloom and consternation over\r\nthe Indian party of reform as struck the Irish Home Rulers on the\r\nnews of the Phœnix Park murders. The month before there had been an\r\nattempt to wreck Sir Andrew Fraser’s train as he was returning from\r\nOrissa; but this was the first political assassination, and every\r\none knew that it would be answered by more repression, leading to\r\nfurther outrages and more repression again. Nothing worse could have\r\nbefallen the party that still hoped for some sort of agreement in\r\nreform and conciliation with the country’s far-off rulers, and the\r\nmute despondency that fell upon the leaders in the train showed the\r\ndepth of their foreboding.\r\n\r\nEven more ominous were the whispers of growing and violent division\r\nthat reached us at Surat. The Extremist or Nationalist party had\r\ntaken a new and decisive step in pitching a separate camp for\r\nthemselves in a distant quarter of the town. For the last two days\r\nMr. Tilak had been there, organizing and addressing them. The day\r\nbefore they had held a full meeting of five hundred delegates, with\r\nMr. Arabindo Ghose in the chair, and Mr. Tilak had spoken at length\r\non the situation, especially denouncing the rumoured withdrawal of\r\nthe Moderate party from the previous year’s Calcutta resolutions upon\r\nSelf-government, Swadeshi, Boycott, and National Education. Such\r\na withdrawal was not to be endured. Rather than submit they would\r\noppose the election of the President himself, even though the chair\r\nwas waiting to receive him.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions were nowhere to be seen. Rumour said they had been\r\naltered past recognition. The heading of a Draft Constitution for the\r\nCongress was found. There it stood written that the ultimate goal of\r\nthe Congress was “the attainment by India of self-government similar\r\nto that enjoyed by the other members of the British empire.” That was\r\nMr. Gokhale’s work! How inferior to the Calcutta resolution that “the\r\nsystem of Government obtaining in the self-governing British Colonies\r\nshould be extended to India”! “Other members of the British Empire”\r\nmight mean Crown Colonies, Dependencies, anything! The Self-governing\r\nColonies must be the model, and nothing else! That the heading of the\r\ndraft implied nothing else,—that no one in his senses would apply the\r\nword “Self-government” to a Crown Colony, did not matter. Undermining\r\nways were at work! The Calcutta resolutions were being tampered\r\nwith! the Moderates were capturing the Congress in the enemy’s\r\ninterest! It was not to be endured.\r\n\r\nThe whole air was full of suspicion. The mere choice of Surat for\r\nthe Congress after Nagpur was abandoned—how suspicious that was!\r\nSurat, too close a neighbour to Bombay, the very stronghold of\r\n“Bombay Moderates”—Parsis, mere Parliamentarians, unredeemed by the\r\nfire of sacrifice, men who would make the best of both worlds, men\r\nwho took titles from an alien Government! It was in Surat that Sir\r\nPherozeshah Mehta had founded his fortunes. Now he dominated all\r\nthe west coast, all the Presidency of Bombay, and here he was seen\r\nwith Mr. Dinshaw Edulji Wacha, most statistical of Parsis, himself\r\nPresident of the Calcutta Congress in 1901. All the other obedient\r\nsatellites were circling round him too, bent on conciliating a\r\nGovernment that answered conciliation with titles or contempt. Was\r\na National Congress to be manipulated by mitred Parsis? It was all\r\nvery well to plead Sir Pherozeshah’s services to India in the past—in\r\nthe days when, as a disciple of Ranade himself, he had stood almost\r\nalone against the bureaucracy, had displayed a courage equal to Mr.\r\nGokhale’s, an eloquence hardly second to Surendra Nath’s, a power of\r\nsarcasm hardly rivalled by Moti Lal’s; had been chosen President of\r\nthe young Congress in 1890; had conquered for Indians the control of\r\nthe Bombay Corporation; had converted his city into a model of local\r\ngovernment; had swept away her slums and purged her administration.\r\nTo the suspicious Nationalist these things were nothing now. They\r\nbelonged to the past, to the scrap-heaps of dead reputations. The\r\ncrisis called for other arms, other methods. It was no longer a\r\nbattle of slums and water, no longer a thing of appeals for sympathy\r\nand dear old Lord Ripon’s reforms. Even Sir Pherozeshah’s address at\r\nthe Bombay Congress only three years before was now suspect. He was\r\nchairman of the Reception Committee, and one remembered the passage\r\nwhich ran:—\r\n\r\n  “My steadfast loyalty is founded upon the rock of hope and\r\n  patience. Seeking the will of Providence, like Oliver Cromwell,\r\n  in dispensations rather than revelations, seeing God’s will, like\r\n  him, in the fulfilment of events, I accept British rule, as Ranade\r\n  did, as a dispensation so wonderful—a little island set at one end\r\n  of the world establishing itself in a far continent as different\r\n  as different could be—that it would be folly not to accept it as a\r\n  declaration of God’s will. But, as I have often said, when, in the\r\n  inscrutable dispensation of Providence, this country was assigned\r\n  to the care of England: the choice was offered to England as to\r\n  Israel of old: ‘Behold I have placed before you a blessing and a\r\n  curse; a blessing, if ye will obey the commandments of the Lord\r\n  your God; a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments, but go\r\n  after other gods, whom ye have not known.’ We cordially confess\r\n  that, in the main, England has chosen wisely and well.... But the\r\n  acceptance and announcement of a policy of righteousness is one\r\n  thing, its application is another.”\r\n\r\nTo the suspicious Nationalist the time for such language was three\r\nyears past. Such compliments, such protests, all belonged to the\r\nage of innocence, before the Partition of Bengal proved the real\r\ncharacter of England’s domination and the futility of protest and\r\nof compliment alike. It was known that in a Provincial Conference\r\nlately, here in Surat itself, Sir Pherozeshah had secured the\r\nexclusion of the great questions of Boycott and National Education\r\napart from Government aid. All evidences pointed one way: the Bombay\r\nModerates were not the men for times like these; the Bombay Moderates\r\nmust go!\r\n\r\nSo in the Nationalist camp suspicion cried aloud, and indignation\r\ngrew on rumour. In the afternoon of Christmas Day, just before\r\nthe President-elect arrived in insecure triumph, Lala Lajpat Rai\r\nhimself went to the Nationalist camp—Lajpat Rai, the quiet, fearless\r\nman, with all the honour of dishonour still upon him; a Moderate,\r\na close friend of Gokhale, but a patriot above suspicion, the man\r\nput forward as President by the Nationalists themselves, had he not\r\nrefused to stand rather than hasten the dangerous breach. Surely\r\nhe, if any one, might serve as peacemaker. He proposed a conference\r\nbetween the parties, five leaders aside. The Nationalists appointed\r\ntheir representatives—Mr. Tilak, Mr. Arabindo Ghose, Mr. Khaparde\r\nof Nagpur, and two others. On the bare hope of peace, Lajpat Rai\r\nsought Mr. Gokhale at the station as the President-elect steamed in.\r\nWhat a moment to arrange a conference! How could even Mr. Gokhale\r\nappoint five leaders to represent sixteen hundred delegates? For\r\nthe twenty-two years of its existence the Congress had settled the\r\nform of its resolutions by a “Subjects Committee,” which met for\r\ndiscussion in the evening after the Presidential address. Why depart\r\nfrom constitutional usage now?\r\n\r\nSo behind Rash Behari’s triumphal carriage, amid the shouting and\r\nthe garlands and the flags, death, distrust, and suspicion whispered\r\nof mortality. That night few slept. Backwards and forwards, from\r\ntent to tent and house to house, the leaders passed, discussing,\r\nconsulting, deliberating, full of uncertainty and apprehension.\r\nMorning found them still apprehensive and uncertain. In a last effort\r\nto secure Mr. Surendra Nath Banerjea, if not peace, Mr. Tilak,\r\nArabindo Ghose, and Mr. Khaparde went to his house with proposals.\r\nMr. Moti Lal Ghose, of the _Amrita Bazar Patrika_, went with him\r\nas peacemaker, though that remarkable man had qualifications for\r\nthe task about on a level with a porcupine’s. To Surendra Nath\r\nthey proposed two conditions under which they would refrain from\r\nopposing the President’s election: the four Calcutta resolutions\r\non Self-government, Swadeshi, the Boycott, and National Education\r\nmust be repeated in the same form as last year, and some “graceful\r\nallusion” must be made by one of the speakers on the election of the\r\nPresident, “to the desire of the public to have Lajpat Rai in the\r\nChair.” To make such an allusion graceful at such a moment might have\r\npuzzled even Surendra Nath’s eloquence. But he was not the man to\r\nabandon either party in their need. He undertook both conditions for\r\nhimself, and advised the Nationalists to seek an interview with Mr.\r\nGokhale or Mr. Tribhovandas Malvi, a Surat gentleman, chairman of the\r\nReception Committee, and supreme in the Congress till the President\r\nwas elected. They did not attempt to see Mr. Gokhale. Mr. Malvi could\r\nnot see them, because he was engaged in prayer.\r\n\r\nOne by one the fateful hours of the morning passed away. By noon the\r\nCongress delegates and the vast audience who had paid for seats began\r\nto gather in the Pandal. The meeting was to have begun at one, but,\r\nto allow time for burning the body of a Scinde delegate who had died,\r\nit was put off till half-past two. The delay was unfortunate. In that\r\nenormous pavilion of striped canvas full ten thousand people were\r\nalready assembled. The architect had constructed it for something\r\nover ten thousand, and every place was full. The delegates from all\r\nthe provinces of India, with a few to represent the Indian grievances\r\nin the Transvaal, numbered perhaps sixteen hundred, of whom five\r\nhundred might be called Extremists of one kind or the other. On\r\nthe platform sat some thirty to forty Indian ladies, Parsis, for\r\nthe most part, but Hindus and even Mohammedans as well, significant\r\nof a deeper change than politics. The other thousands were the\r\nindistinguishable audience who had come to listen, or perhaps do more\r\nthan listen. The whole interior, constructed on different levels so\r\nthat all might see, rose and fell in waves of brilliant turbans,\r\norange, crimson, gold, and white, according to the provinces from\r\nwhich they came, and in a black and solid square sat the bare-headed\r\ndelegates from Bengal. Under the burning sun that pierced the roof\r\nthe whole of that vast crowd remained for hours, disputing, arguing,\r\nexhorting each other in groups and districts, a dubious exercise of\r\npatience.\r\n\r\nThe platform people began to arrive. Among the first came Dr.\r\nRutherford, Member of the Mother of Parliaments, now visiting India\r\nin hope of understanding a little of her distress. At his side was\r\nanother of “the ruling race,” come for the same purpose. As they\r\nadvanced up the centre of the throng applause and shouts of “Bande\r\nMataram” received them, but under all the shouting one heard low,\r\npenetrating hisses and angry cries of “Shame!” from men who no longer\r\nendured a sign of British rule, not even in the way of friendship.\r\nThen a quiet, white-turbaned figure, with sad determination in his\r\nlook, entered from the side. Like one man, the ten thousand sprang to\r\ntheir feet. Cheer followed cheer; it seemed as though the cheering\r\nwould never cease. Who does not love the man that has suffered for a\r\ncause? It was Lajpat Rai.\r\n\r\nA few minutes afterwards the Volunteers were seen lining the central\r\npassage again, and up the midst in a solid body came Dr. Rash Behari\r\nGhose, President-elect; Sir Pherozeshah Mehta, the mitred Parsi;\r\nMr. Wacha, the sane, unwearied master of statistics; Mr. Surendra\r\nNath Banerjea, the orator of Bengal; Mr. Gokhale, whom some were\r\ntired of hearing called the Just; and other leaders of the Congress,\r\nfamous and trusted for twenty years. At the sight, opposition shut\r\nits voice. The cheering rose, and rose again. In honour done to\r\npatriots so long conspicuous and so tenacious against contempt\r\nand failure, it seemed as though the day might yet pass without a\r\nrupture. The platform was reached. Mr. Tribhovandas Malvi, Chairman\r\nof the Reception Committee, rose to welcome the Congress in the name\r\nof his native Surat, and there was silence. He told the history of\r\nSurat, and passed on to the history of the Congress. People do not\r\nwant to hear history when they are making it. Moghuls, Mahrattas,\r\nFrench Factories that stood on their very ground where now the Pandal\r\nstood—what did all of them matter? King Shivaji, he was dead. The\r\nearly efforts of the Congress, the failures, the successes—all were\r\ndead. But the present moment was alive and big with futurity. For\r\nheaven’s sake, come to the present moment! So the assembly waited,\r\nimpatient, but in silence, save that at the word “moderation” a\r\nbreath of murmur stirred.\r\n\r\nThe address ended. Dewan Bahadur Ambalal S. Desai, late Chief Justice\r\nof progressive Baroda, learned in law, in banking, and commercial\r\nenterprise, rose formally to propose that Dr. Ghose, already\r\ndesignated President, should now take the Presidential Chair. At the\r\nname of Ghose, the deep murmur of dissent was heard again, and one\r\nshrill voice cried, “Never!” But the moment the Dewan sat down, Mr.\r\nBanerjea was seen standing in his place beside the table—Surendra\r\nNath, the hero of a hundred platforms, grey-bearded son of thunder,\r\nyouthful still in the service of the cause, by reason and temperament\r\nfriend and champion of both parties alike. He was to second the\r\nproposal that Dr. Ghose should take the Chair. Hardly had his immense\r\nvoice uttered ten words when, like the cracking of thunder that\r\nbegins before the lightning ceases, the tumult burst, and no word\r\nmore was heard.\r\n\r\nWaving their arms, their scarves, their sticks, and umbrellas, a\r\nsolid mass of delegates and spectators on the right of the Chair\r\nsprang to their feet and shouted without a moment’s pause. Over their\r\nheads was the label, “Central Provinces”—Central Provinces where\r\nNagpur stands and the Congress was to have been. “Remember Nagpur!”\r\nthey cried; “Remember Midnapur!” where, during the Bengal Provincial\r\nConference a week or two before, Surendra Nath had attempted to keep\r\nthe peace against the Extremists, and had actually sat on the same\r\nplatform with a District Superintendent of Police! White turbans\r\nfrom Madras joined them. The whole ten thousand were on their feet,\r\nshouting for order, shouting for tumult. Mr. Malvi, still half in the\r\nChair, rang his brass Benares bell, and rang in vain. Surendra Nath\r\nsprang upon the very table itself. Even a voice like his was not a\r\nwhisper in the din. Again and again he shouted, unheard as silence.\r\nHe sat down, and for a moment the storm was lulled. The voices of the\r\nleaders were audible, consulting in agitated tones—Dr. Ghose shrill,\r\nimpatient, and perturbed with anger; Mr. Gokhale distressed, anxious,\r\nharassed with vain negotiation and sleepless nights. Already one\r\ncaught the word “suspension.” “If they will not hear Surendra Nath,\r\nwhom will they hear?” said one. “It is an insult to the Congress,”\r\nsaid another. “An insult to Bengal!” cried a third. Again Surendra\r\nNath sprang on the table, and again the assembly roared with clamour.\r\nAgain the Chairman rang his Benares bell, and rang in vain. In an\r\ninaudible voice like a sob he declared the sitting suspended. The\r\nplatform rose, Surendra Nath descended, the Indian ladies, who had\r\nbeguiled the long waiting by chanting the hymn of “Bande Mataram”\r\nwith quavering voice, filed out through a door at the back, and the\r\nleaders of the Congress movement disappeared into tents prepared for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAfter twenty-two years of steady and regular procedure the Congress\r\nhad broken up in less than an hour. To the excited groups into which\r\nthe great assembly split it seemed incredible. As when a growing\r\nchild overturns the family routine and is astonished to find its\r\nparents distraught and weeping, so the Extremists stood a little\r\namazed and dumbfounded at what they had done. Wild defence was met by\r\nwild denunciation, but no violence followed. It was still a polite\r\nand peaceful people, anxious to leave conciliation open. I conversed\r\nwith Mr. Kelkar of Poona, editor of the _Mahratta_, as Mr. Tilak’s\r\nlieutenant. The outbreak, he said, was accidental and unexpected.\r\nThey had determined to oppose Dr. Ghose’s election, but not by\r\ntumult; they would not even have opposed it had not the Moderate\r\noffer of compromise come too late. I visited the Nationalist camp,\r\nfar across the town, and found Mr. Tilak himself, just returned from\r\nhis dubious triumph, sitting naked in his cloth. He gave me the same\r\nassurance. The whole thing had been a mistake; it had all happened\r\nbecause the undertaking to renew the Calcutta resolutions had reached\r\nhim too late—not till the Chairman had begun his speech. The\r\nresolutions had then been handed to him by Mr. Gokhale, and he had\r\nadmitted he would himself have been satisfied if certain changes in\r\ntheir wording had been removed and the original form restored. But by\r\nthat time it was too late to reassure his followers, or re-establish\r\nhis authority for peace.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to say how far this difficulty about the Calcutta\r\nresolutions was vital, or how far a sincere desire for peace might\r\nhave explained it away. The mere delay in supplying them to Mr. Tilak\r\nwas accidental—the fault of a Surat printer. Mr. Gokhale has said\r\nso, and his word is above suspicion.[51] But he admits that “slight\r\nverbal alterations had been made in one or two of them to remove\r\nambiguity,” and it was left, as usual, for the Subjects Committee to\r\ndecide in what form they should finally be submitted to the Congress.\r\nUnhappily, after the events of the day, there was no chance or\r\nthought of a Subjects Committee meeting, and the disputed alterations\r\nremained unsettled. Some were obviously unimportant, unless a\r\nquarrel was desired on any straw. The change from “the system\r\nof government obtaining in the self-governing Colonies” to “the\r\nself-government enjoyed by other members of the British Empire” in a\r\ndraft constitution implied no change of meaning, but, hearing of the\r\ncriticism, Mr. Gokhale had himself inserted the word “self-governing”\r\nbefore “members of the British Empire.” In the Swadeshi resolution,\r\nthe Calcutta version had promised “to stimulate the production\r\nof indigenous articles by giving them preference over imported\r\ncommodities even at some sacrifice”; in the new draft this sentence\r\nappeared as “to stimulate the consumption of indigenous articles by\r\ngiving them preference where possible over imported commodities.”\r\nHere the omission of the words “even at some sacrifice” was due to\r\nthe inaccuracy of the newspaper copy, from which the resolution\r\nwas taken. In the Calcutta resolution about National Education\r\nthe clause proposing “to organize a system of education—literary,\r\nscientific, and technical—suited to the requirements of the country\r\non national lines and under national control” had been altered in\r\nthe new draft to a proposal “to organize an independent system\r\nof education—literary, scientific, and technical—suited to the\r\nrequirements of the country.” Mr. Gokhale defended the alteration\r\non the ground that it avoided the triple repetition of the word\r\n“national,” was more restrained in form, and “more in accord with\r\nwhat was being actually attempted in different parts of India.” In\r\nthe changes so far there was nothing to split a party determined to\r\npreserve its unity.\r\n\r\nThe difference in the remaining resolution was vital. It went to\r\nthe very root of the difference between the parties, and for the\r\nsake of it alone the proposed changes remain worthy of notice. In\r\nthe original Calcutta resolution the Congress was “of opinion that\r\nthe Boycott Movement inaugurated by Bengal by way of protest against\r\nthe Partition of that province was and is legitimate.” In the new\r\nform proposed for discussion in the Subjects Committee the wording\r\nran, “This Congress is of opinion that the Boycott of foreign goods\r\nresorted to in Bengal by way of protest against the Partition of that\r\nprovince was and is legitimate.” All the difference between Moderates\r\nand Extremists—just the one point which made genuine conciliation\r\nimpossible—lay implied in that small difference of wording. “Boycott\r\nof foreign goods” was plain; it was a necessary part of Swadeshi,\r\nwhether used as a political protest or as an encouragement to Indian\r\nindustries. But “Boycott Movement” might mean the rejection of\r\nalmost anything—the rejection of foreign goods, of foreign justice,\r\nforeign appointments, foreign education, foreign authority, taxation,\r\nGovernment itself. Already it had been so interpreted, both at the\r\nCalcutta Congress and frequently throughout the year. To yield on\r\nthis point would be to hand over the Congress to Extremists for ever,\r\nto abandon the first principles of the Congress, which had been to\r\nwork out the salvation of India in association with the British\r\nrulers, and endeavour, in spite of Anglo-Indian mockery and hatred,\r\nto invoke the sense of justice which must somewhere surely lie in\r\nthe heart of so great and free a people as the English. If these\r\nfirst principles were now to be abandoned, if the Congress was to\r\nbe pledged to call upon India to go her own way, regardless of the\r\nEnglish people and the English Government, the Congress as it had\r\nhitherto existed might as well give up the pretence of existence,\r\nand bequeath its effects to a new and different force. Here was no\r\nhalf-way house, no common ground for compromise. The alteration in\r\nthe wording was vital.\r\n\r\nOn this difference at the root negotiation failed. The Boycott\r\nresolution was perhaps not even mentioned, but at the back of men’s\r\nminds the difference lay. Through the evening and night negotiations\r\ncontinued. The Nationalists held another conference in their camp.\r\nUnless the Calcutta resolutions were replaced in the original form,\r\nthey were instructed to oppose the election of Dr. Ghose, but to\r\nallow all speakers a fair hearing and create no tumult. Envoys passed\r\nbetween the camps; could not a joint committee of the parties meet\r\nfor discussion? Could not Mr. Gokhale and Mr. Tilak meet? Could not\r\nSurendra Nath act as conciliator? Could not Dr. Rutherford, Member\r\nof the Mother of Parliaments, be asked for the advice of historic\r\nexperience? Backwards and forwards the negotiation went, and during\r\nthat night also few slept.\r\n\r\nThe morning of December 27th again found them at variance, still\r\nuncertain, their mood more fretted by sleeplessness and anxiety.\r\nBut a general anticipation of peace prevailed, because all foresaw\r\nwhat the enemies of reform would say if the Congress collapsed. By\r\nnoon the Pandal was again full to overflowing. At one o’clock the\r\nPresidential procession entered. Again Dr. Rash Behari Ghose bore\r\nwith him the printed copy of his Presidential address, which ought\r\nto have been delivered the afternoon before, and had, unhappily,\r\nappeared that morning in some of the Calcutta papers, with an attack\r\nupon the Extremists still unaltered.[52] At his side, as before,\r\ncame the familiar Congress leaders, and amid stormy applause that\r\nbreathed defiance to interruption, they took their seats behind\r\nthe green table that stretched the whole length of the high-raised\r\nplatform, before which there was no railing, but only, as it were, an\r\nescarpment for defence.\r\n\r\nIn the front row of the delegates, not in the place reserved for him\r\non the platform, Mr. Tilak was seated. As the procession entered he\r\nsent a note to the Chairman by one of the boy Volunteers to say he\r\nwished to speak on the election of the President after the seconder\r\nhad spoken. According to his own account, he added, “I wish to move\r\nan adjournment with a constructive proposal,” apparently referring to\r\nanother special conference of delegates from both sides. According\r\nto the Chairman and others who claimed to have seen the note, it\r\nproposed “an amendment for the adjournment of the Congress.” It\r\nwas a difference much argued afterwards, but the note itself had\r\ndisappeared into chaos and could no more be recovered than the\r\nSibyl’s leaves that flitted round her cave.\r\n\r\nIn deliberate and expectant silence the proceedings began. Mr. Malvi\r\ncalled upon Mr. Banerjea to take up his speech, seconding the\r\nappointment of Dr. Ghose as President. Speaking with a chastened\r\nexuberance, as of a hero rebuked by fate, Surendra Nath appealed to\r\nthe past achievements of the Congress, appealed to the necessity\r\nof union for strength, and sat down amid silence, amid applause.\r\nMr. Motilal Nehru, wealthy barrister of Allahabad, circumspect and\r\nrespected, Moderate by nature in everything but generosity, said a\r\nfew sentences. Every one went delicately, moving on a crust of ashes.\r\nIn inaudible words Mr. Malvi proposed that Dr. Ghose should take\r\nthe Chair as President, and amid various shouting he declared the\r\nmotion carried. Heavy with years and knowledge, Dr. Ghose transferred\r\nhimself to the seat, and rose at once to deliver that thoughtfully\r\nprepared address. “Brother Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen,” he\r\nbegan, “my first duty is to tender you my thanks for the signal\r\nhonour you have done me.”\r\n\r\nBeyond his first duty he never went. As when lightning flashes in air\r\nsurcharged with storm, Mr. Tilak was seen standing straight in front\r\nof the Presidential Chair itself, expostulating, protesting, all in\r\nthat calm, decisive voice of his, the voice of a man indifferent to\r\nfate. He had given notice of an amendment, he was there to move it,\r\nand there he would remain. “You cannot move an adjournment of the\r\nCongress,” cried Mr. Malvi; “I declare you out of order.” “I wish to\r\nmove an amendment to the election of President, and you are not in\r\nthe Chair,” Mr. Tilak replied. “I declare you out of order!” cried\r\nDr. Ghose. “You have not been elected,” answered Mr. Tilak; “I appeal\r\nto the delegates.”\r\n\r\nUproar drowned the rest. With folded arms Mr. Tilak faced the\r\naudience. On either side of him young Moderates sprang to their feet,\r\nwildly gesticulating vengeance. Shaking their fists and yelling to\r\nthe air, they clamoured to hurl him down the steep of the platform.\r\nBehind him, Dr. Ghose mounted the table, and, ringing an unheard\r\nbell, harangued the storm in shrill, agitated, unintelligible\r\ndenunciations. Restraining the rage of Moderates, ingeminating peace\r\nif ever man ingeminated, Mr. Gokhale, sweet-natured even in extremes,\r\nstood beside his old opponent, flinging out both arms to protect him\r\nfrom the threatened onset. But Mr. Tilak asked for no protection. He\r\nstood there with folded arms, defiant, calling on violence to do its\r\nworst, calling on violence to move him, for he would move for nothing\r\nelse in hell or heaven. In front, the white-clad audience roared like\r\na tumultuous sea.\r\n\r\nSuddenly something flew through the air—a shoe!—a Mahratta\r\nshoe!—reddish leather, pointed toe, sole studded with lead. It\r\nstruck Surendra Nath Banerjea on the cheek; it cannoned off upon\r\nSir Pherozeshah Mehta. It flew, it fell, and, as at a given signal,\r\nwhite waves of turbaned men surged up the escarpment of the\r\nplatform. Leaping, climbing, hissing the breath of fury, brandishing\r\nlong sticks, they came, striking at any head that looked to them\r\nModerate, and in another moment, between brown legs standing upon the\r\ngreen-baize table, I caught glimpses of the Indian National Congress\r\ndissolving in chaos.\r\n\r\nLike Goethe at the battle of Valmy, I could have said, “To-day marks\r\nthe beginning of a new era, and you can say that you were present at\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nThe Indian ladies vanished. The platform leaders withdrew rapidly\r\nthrough a door at the back of the Pandal. Mr. Tilak was borne off\r\nby his followers. But in the vast pavilion itself a combat raged\r\nat large. Chairs, useless now except as missiles, flew through the\r\nair like shells discharged at a venture; long sticks clashed and\r\nshivered; blood flowed from broken heads. Group rushed upon group,\r\ndelegate upon delegate. Breathing slaughter, they glared for victims.\r\nIt was hard to tell friend from foe. Ten thousand men, all crowded\r\ntogether among ten thousand chairs, no uniform, no distinction,\r\nnothing to mark off Extremist from Moderate except the facial\r\nexpression of a temperament—it was a confused and difficult conflict\r\nto maintain. Who would wish to fall to the bludgeon of a political\r\nfriend? Nor was a certain chivalry or politeness wanting. Standing\r\nin the midst on a chair from which I could command the scene, I\r\nwatched two champions, beaked vultures from the North, belabouring\r\neach other with murderous intent. By an adroit stroke one brought\r\nhis stick down on the other’s skull, and knocked his turban off.\r\nInstantly a truce was granted till the many yards of long white\r\nturban had been rapidly rolled tight again, and then with fresh fury\r\nthe contest was renewed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENTRANCE TO THE PANDAL AT SURAT.\r\n\r\nTHE LINE OF RETREAT.\r\n\r\n  [_Face p. 258._\r\n]\r\n\r\nSo with varied incident the combat swayed and raged and crackled.\r\nSuddenly the police appeared—no mistaking them in their short blue\r\nuniforms and the little clubs that made no political distinctions.\r\nOnly about thirty entered, but thirty men who know what they want\r\nare to ten thousand who are not quite sure like a dog to sheep. With\r\nthem came their Superintendent, their Inspector—Scottish, small and\r\nwizened as a prize jockey, calmly ordering here, ordering there,\r\nprotected in the roaring turmoil only by courage and a penny cane.\r\nBit by bit the tumult was driven out by the doors into the open.\r\nWithin an hour the vast Pandal, strewn with broken chairs, sticks,\r\nand rags of raiment, stood empty as a banquet-hall deserted.\r\n\r\nEven that night negotiations were again renewed. But suspicion had\r\nnow gone too deep, and, as in an instinctive quarrel, each attempt\r\nat conciliation revealed a new distrust. Next day (December 28th)\r\nopened with savage rumours of bloodshed, but two hundred police now\r\nguarded the wreck of the Pandal, and there, in anxious and regretful\r\nsecurity, a convention of nine hundred Moderates met. They had signed\r\nan agreement to preserve order, to promote reform by constitutional\r\nmeans, and to aim at self-government similar to the self-government\r\nexisting in other parts of the Empire. Dr. Ghose was in the Chair,\r\nsome of the prominent leaders spoke, and a committee was appointed\r\nto watch events. The most significant point in the meeting was the\r\npresence of Lajpat Rai upon the platform, and his declaration that he\r\nwould continue to fight under the old banner of the Congress was at\r\nsuch a moment worth a thousand men.\r\n\r\nThe Convention then turned to consider the woes of Indians in the\r\nTransvaal, whose delegates had been wandering about in the chaos,\r\ntearfully lamenting the vanity of human wishes. In the afternoon the\r\nExtremists also held a convention, and also appointed a committee\r\nto watch events. In the large courtyard of a private house they met\r\nin silent crowds. Grave and silent—I think without saying a single\r\nword—Mr. Arabindo Ghose took the Chair, and sat unmoved, with far-off\r\neyes, as one who gazes at futurity. In clear, short sentences,\r\nwithout eloquence or passion, Mr. Tilak spoke till the stars shone\r\nout and some one kindled a lantern at his side. He reviewed the\r\nsituation, accused the “Bombay Moderates” of seeking favour with the\r\nGovernment and rejecting the Nationalist offers of compromise. He had\r\nno wish to destroy the Congress, for its prestige was useful; but a\r\nnew spirit had entered Indian affairs, and unless the Congress was\r\npermeated with the new spirit it had better die—it was dead already.\r\nBy the new spirit he meant self-confidence and self-assertion,\r\ncontrasted with the old methods of petitions for rights, appeals for\r\njustice, and other forms of mendicancy which the British Government\r\nanswered with elusive promises, and the Anglo-Indians with scorn.\r\n\r\nSo, on that note of deep and perhaps irreconcilable divergence,\r\nthe twenty-third Indian National Congress ended. Many delegates\r\nremained in Surat for a day or two, taking part in conferences upon\r\nchild-marriage, widow-remarriage, the education of women, Indian\r\nindustries, the drink problem, the revelations of the Divine Will,\r\nand other questions of permanent interest for Indian life. But the\r\nCongress was over. The work of the old Congress as it had existed\r\nfor all those years was rolled up and done. Re-union of Moderate\r\nand Extremist in some form might still be possible; for a militant\r\nparty, a nationalist party, an Opposition is never long divided,\r\nand oppression is a fine reconciler. But breach or no breach, all\r\nfelt the Congress would never be the same again. In the twinkling\r\nof a shoe it had been changed, and a new spirit, a different and\r\ndifficult spirit, had indeed arisen in the country.\r\n\r\nAs I returned with the leaders of the Congress movement in the train,\r\neach station rang with shouts of “Down with Rash Behari!” “Down with\r\nGokhale!” “Down with Surendra Nath!” Not a cheer, not a single cry of\r\n“Jai!” That was on a Sunday, and on the Wednesday before no cheering,\r\nno garlands had seemed enough. It had been roses, roses all the way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SACRED RIVER.\r\n\r\n  [_Face p. 262._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[50] Towards the conclusion of his speech came the following\r\ncharacteristic sentences: “I oppose this Bill because it violates all\r\nthe traditions which have up to this time guided the Government. I\r\noppose this Bill because I wish to see the English Rule broadbased\r\non the people’s will, and not resting merely on the sword, whether\r\nIndian or British. And, lastly, I oppose this Bill because it will\r\nkill all political life in this country.... One word more. It is\r\nunfortunate that the 1st of November should have been fixed for this\r\nmeeting. That day has always been associated in our minds with the\r\ngracious Proclamation of Queen Victoria. It will now be associated\r\nwith the loss of one of our most cherished rights.”\r\n\r\n[51] See Mr. Gokhale’s letters on the Breach in the Congress, the\r\n_Bengalee_, January 13 and 14, 1908.\r\n\r\n[52] The main part of the address was a sorrowful indictment of\r\nMr. Morley’s government during the year, an answer to the Arbroath\r\nspeech, and a criticism of the professed Simla reforms. It then\r\npassed to the situation between the two parties in India, and\r\nconcluded with a strong repudiation of the Extremist position, and a\r\nwarning to Extremists “not to be beguiled by phantoms, nor to expect\r\nthey could end the British rule by boycotting the administration,”\r\nwhereas their only chance lay in co-operation with the Government in\r\nevery measure likely to hasten their political emancipation. At the\r\nend of the copy which Dr. Ghose gave me, and which he intended to\r\nread to the Congress, was a manuscript note expressing deep regret\r\nat the murderous attempt upon Mr. Allen in Eastern Bengal, and the\r\nfollowing peroration, also in manuscript:—\r\n\r\n“I call upon you to fight for your rights, resolved not to be beaten,\r\nnor even knowing when you are beaten. To doubt of victory is to doubt\r\nthe justice of our cause. It is to doubt our courage and the strength\r\nof our combination. It is to doubt the honesty and sincerity of a\r\ngreat people who are bound by every obligation of duty to redeem\r\ntheir pledges. It is to doubt the irresistible force of moral power\r\nin the affairs of nations. We may be baffled for a time, our efforts\r\nmay be abortive, but I have faith in the justice of our cause, faith\r\nin your patriotism, in the English nation, and in the sword of the\r\navenging angel. Let us then work, not in sorrow or despondency, but\r\nin the joyful assurance that our cause will triumph and our country\r\ntake her rightful place in the Federation of the Empire.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nA CITY OF GOD\r\n\r\n\r\nI had escaped to the Ganges, as myriads of transitory pilgrims\r\nhave escaped before. From the distractions of politics and the\r\ndust of practical reforms I had come to the quiet river, sliding\r\nunder immemorial walls. The water was still white and dove-coloured\r\nwith morning, but already along the thin crescent of the shore,\r\nwhite-robed men and women were coming down the steps with naked\r\nfeet, and silently approaching the edge. They threw long strings of\r\nmarigolds into the stream. Stooping down, they scooped up the water\r\nin brazen pots, and set a marigold upon the mouth of each. Hung with\r\nflowers, and bearing on their foreheads the triple mark of the god,\r\nmen settled cross-legged upon slabs of stone or wooden platforms, and\r\nplunged at once into prayer, or, opening long and narrow books, began\r\nto recite aloud the words of inspired ancestors. Men and women alike,\r\nstill draped in white, walked step by step down into the water, till\r\nit passed over their heads, and then came back step by step, and\r\nstood dripping in prayer. They raised water in their hands, splashed\r\nit three times on their mouths and foreheads, and with arms lifted\r\nto the risen sun, poured what was left back into the river. Covering\r\nher face with her hands, one girl knelt upon the bare stone so long\r\nin adoration that the sun dried her one white length of sari, and it\r\nhung loose around her form again.\r\n\r\nThe common life of the holy city began, and the calling of\r\nthe milkmen, the cake-sellers, the fruiterers, and drivers of\r\nbullock-carts mingled with the temple bells. They brought the dead\r\ndown to the river, hung with marigolds, and wrapped in cotton cloths\r\nas when they lived. Pushing them feet forwards a little way out\r\nfrom shore, they let them soak in the holy water until wooden pyres\r\nshould be ready to consume their deserted forms, happy in a double\r\npurification. Washerwomen carried down their bundles of linen, and\r\nswung each piece over their heads again and again upon flat stones\r\nin the water, until it was cleansed, with the added advantage of\r\nsanctity. Ascetics in brick-dust robes passed up and down among\r\nthe crowd, bearing long staves in memory of their vow to constrain\r\ntheir thoughts, their speech, and their desires. Other ascetics,\r\ndressed only in a transparent coating of ashes, sat in perpetual\r\ncontemplation, forgetful of the body and the world. One man I saw in\r\nfaded yellow robe, worn by sun and rain, passing quietly in and\r\nout of the worshipping throng, as he followed the little footpath\r\nby the water’s brink. He was of those who all the year long tread\r\nthe bank of the Ganges, from her source in the mountains to her\r\nmouth among the forest swamps, and back again to her source in\r\nthe mountains. On that day’s walk he happened to be passing again\r\nthrough her most sacred city, but that seemed hardly to interrupt his\r\ncontemplation of her holiness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ON THE BANK.\r\n\r\n[_Face p. 264._ ]\r\n\r\n“Yours is the Order I should belong to by nature,” I said, giving him\r\na halfpenny, for which he had not asked.\r\n\r\n“For you it would be easy and difficult,” he answered, in good\r\nEnglish, and led me up many steps and along galleries overhanging\r\na cliff of ruinous masonry to a cool courtyard, where Brahmans are\r\ndaily fed on boiled rice and salt, laid out upon a plate of stitched\r\nbanana leaves.\r\n\r\n“Obviously it would be easy for you as for any one,” he went on as\r\nwe climbed up, after his meal, to the top of the flat roof where a\r\nlittle shelter had been erected for shade and worship; “but for you\r\nit would be difficult also, because you hang upon the world, and your\r\nsoul is entangled in illusions and desires. Like all your people, you\r\ncall the unreal things realities, and for reality you have no name.”\r\n\r\nHaving devoted himself for a while to prayer, he continued: “You see\r\nthis low parapet? Many years ago a boy was seated upon it reading\r\na Sanscrit book of wisdom, when, it is thought, a monkey, inspired\r\nby the god, pushed him, and he fell. Look over and you will see\r\nthe projecting slab half way down which he broke as he fell. They\r\ngathered up his shattered body, and laid it, almost alive, in the\r\nGanges. I cannot doubt that he attained at once to salvation, his\r\nsoul returning to the universal consciousness, as the space inside\r\na pot returns to universal space when the pot is broken. And in his\r\nsalvation I may claim a share, for I was his father.”\r\n\r\nIt was noon, and the sun blazed upon the roof. Green parrots flew\r\nscreaming among the trees of a garden far below us. The hum of the\r\ncity arose, pierced with loud cries, and over the far-off iron\r\nbridge across the Ganges a train was slowly passing with prolonged\r\nand shrieking whistle. But still the crowding pilgrims moved down\r\nthe steps to the water’s edge, and bathed and offered flowers, and\r\nstretched up their hands in silent adoration, or recited ancient and\r\nsacred words aloud.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BURNING PLACE.\r\n\r\nTHE RIVER WALLS.\r\n\r\n  [_Face p. 266._\r\n]\r\n\r\n“It is possible for you,” I said, after a long time, “to desire\r\nescape from the danger of rebirth, and to speak of being merged in\r\nthe universal consciousness as salvation. But how about these people\r\nwho come in millions to the river? All their lives they struggle\r\nonly to live. From day to day their thought is only to keep alight\r\ntheir little glimmer of life, and hand it on to others who are\r\ntheir children. How is it to be supposed that they come to the river\r\nso wearied of existence as to pray only to be saved from being born\r\nagain? I myself, who am one of them, would walk in the opposite\r\ndirection if I thought the river was going to extinguish my life, and\r\nfor choice I should rather be born a mouse than nothing.”\r\n\r\n“You remind me,” he answered, “of those worshippers of Vishnu, who\r\npray in great humility, ‘Let me be born a cat or dog, if only I may\r\nlove thee, O God.’ It is a great prayer, and you may join in it, for,\r\nbeing a wanderer through the world, you can always hope to become a\r\nreligious man, avoiding the many-sided degradation of which people\r\ntell me who have visited the West. I, too, was once engaged in common\r\nbusiness, managing large estates in this very city, and I know the\r\nrich men in the streets, though they cannot now tell who passes\r\nthem so close. But each day I gave much time to contemplation, and\r\nI took the vow of kindliness to every living thing, just as you see\r\nthose Jain monks there who are feeding ants with sugar, and would\r\nnot wittingly kill a cholera germ; or like those wandering Sisters\r\nof the faith who wear a strip of white felt across their mouths lest\r\nthey should breathe a midge to death, and carry soft brooms in their\r\nhands to sweep the place where they are about to sit, lest the weight\r\nof their frail bodies should crush an irrecoverable life. By such\r\nmeans, even in your present body, you may begin to penetrate the\r\nillusions of existence, and at rare moments may perceive some gleam\r\nfrom what one of your poets has called the white radiance of eternity.\r\n\r\n“As for these pilgrims,” he went on, “they are like a woman who\r\nlights her cow-dung fire at evening, not considering as she cooks\r\nthat the flame is composed of ten divisions, each symbolic of a\r\nfaculty of the soul. Or they are like a man who walks by the light\r\nof sun and moon, not considering that sun and moon are nothing but\r\nsymbols of creative power, as are men and women, fire and water, heat\r\nand cold. Or they are like the nautch girls who have a separate song\r\nfor every hour of the day and night, but do not know that their songs\r\nare only the pulses of eternity. In cooking, in light, and in song,\r\neach finds an ignorant joy, and in the same way these pilgrims have\r\na dim sense of righteousness and purification in the outward symbols\r\nof truths that they will never learn in their present life. By such\r\nmeans, for a few hours together, they may free themselves from the\r\nillusions of existence, and in some cases even reach the state of\r\nthose highly religious men who devour putrid cats, to prove that in\r\ntheir estimation all material things are alike, all being equally\r\nunimportant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PLACE OF PRAYER.\r\n\r\n  [_Face p. 268._\r\n]\r\n\r\n“But for people like you,” he continued with pity, “what can one say?\r\nYou are still ensnared by political anxieties, artistic interests,\r\nand the desires of personality. You have far to go before, by\r\ncontemplation and hard discipline, you perceive how like happiness is\r\nto its opposite—how accurately the joy of existence may be compared\r\nto a fire-fly wandering in an unlimited vault of darkness, or to the\r\ninch of cool shadow thrown by a snake’s head upon a burning desert.\r\nTill you can reach that supreme state when birth, and life, and death\r\nhave no separate meaning, you have far to go. But there is always\r\nhope for one who will begin by overcoming earthly desire. For, as you\r\nmay have heard, there has been one being and one alone who in this\r\nflesh attained to salvation without death, and he was Janaka, the\r\nfather of Sita, Rama’s wife. He sat still, you remember, with one\r\nhand in a blazing fire and the other upon a woman’s breast, showing\r\nthat to him the one was the same as the other, and both indifferent.”\r\n\r\nWe descended, and I went away in the rapid twilight, sorrowful\r\nbecause I was not in the least like Janaka. But as I went, I came\r\nto the courtyard of a temple to Shiva, the dissolver of existence,\r\nand there in the darkness I found a lonely woman walking round and\r\nround a sacred tree, driven by the blind desire to bear a child. So\r\nuntameable among the unlearned is the passion for life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE PATIENT EARTH\r\n\r\n\r\n“Cold!” I said, just for something to say, as I came out of the\r\ndak-bungalow into the thin January air before sunrise, and met an\r\neducated Indian, who said “Good morning!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” he answered. “You’d have thought it cold if you had slept\r\nwhere I did.” And he pointed to a dusty place, where he had evidently\r\nbeen lying in front of the house.\r\n\r\n“Why on earth did you sleep there?” I asked; “there was plenty of\r\nroom inside.”\r\n\r\n“I’m a Famine official, and I have been living inside for some nights\r\npast,” he answered. “But when I got back at nine o’clock last night,\r\nI found you were reading in one room and your boy had gone to sleep\r\nin the other, so I stayed out here.”\r\n\r\n“My boy!” I said. “Why, he sleeps everywhere! On the floor of my\r\nroom, at the door—anywhere! Why didn’t you come in?”\r\n\r\n“Well, you see,” he answered, with hesitation, “I saw you were an\r\nEnglishman, and I knew that if I had come in, you’d have kicked me\r\nout, and I didn’t want to be kicked out. That’s why.”\r\n\r\nAs I had been three months in India, I was not surprised, but as a\r\npatriot I found it hard to reply, so I turned the conversation to\r\nFamine and Relief.\r\n\r\nWe were in the United Provinces, where that season’s famine was\r\nparticularly bad. Mr. Theodore Morison has explained that in India\r\nthe word “famine” is now equivalent only to a “suspension of\r\nagricultural industry.”[53] “Now that the relief of the unemployed\r\nis undertaken by Government,” he says, “it is not a fact that\r\nany considerable proportion of the people die of hunger when the\r\nagricultural industry is interrupted.” In the United Provinces, then,\r\nagricultural industry was suspended, and the cause of the suspension\r\nwas obvious. For close on four and a half months not a drop of rain\r\nhad fallen, and day after day the sun rose and set in a sky as clear\r\nand hard as steel. Rain ought to have lasted well into October, and\r\nin December to have begun again, and here was the second week in\r\nJanuary without a drop since August. The December harvest was lost,\r\nand the ground so hard that scarcely a quarter of the usual crops had\r\nbeen sown for the greater harvest due in March. The horror of past\r\nfamines is easily obliterated in India, for what would you expect of\r\na people to whom history is but a sleep and a forgetting? But men who\r\nhad known the course of Indian famines since the seventies told me\r\nthat unless rain came within a fortnight that year’s famine would be\r\nworse than any that India had ever suffered.[54]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A BULLOCK WELL.\r\n\r\n  [_Face p. 272._\r\n]\r\n\r\nComing twenty or thirty miles south of the Jumna from Allahabad,\r\nwhere the Jumna and Ganges join, I had passed through a country\r\nthat became continually more desert. It was nearly flat, and rather\r\nthickly covered with isolated thorns and the heavy mango trees, which\r\nyield a fruit much sought after by the villagers, but now regarded as\r\na chief cause of cholera in famine time. So far, the trees had not\r\nbeen stript bare for fodder, as I afterwards saw them round Delhi,\r\nand the cattle were still kept from the unholy butcher’s hands by\r\na diet of chopped millet stalks, with linseed for the milkers. The\r\nland was divided into tiny fields, about the size of one to four\r\ntennis-courts, marked off by earthen banks, along the top of which\r\nthere is a right of way. Round the mud villages, wherever the wells\r\nstill held water, some of these fields were green with potatoes or\r\nyoung wheat, or a tall bushy pulse with yellow flower, and all\r\nday long the ryots were busy distributing the precious water through\r\nlittle channels among the crops. I suppose no form of irrigation\r\nsurpasses the wells in value, though very many of them are sunk only\r\ntemporarily in times of drought, on account of the expense of sinking\r\na “pukka” or masonry shaft. As in most parts of India that I visited,\r\nthe water is usually drawn up in one or two large bags by bullocks\r\nharnessed to the end of a rope and driven down a steep incline. But\r\nmany of the wells were dry, and so were many of the tanks or public\r\nponds, which, having originally supplied most of the mud for the\r\nvillage habitations, afterwards become the social centres of village\r\nlife. In fact, the only tank I saw with a plentiful supply of water\r\nleft was one that three crocodiles had wisely selected for their\r\nhome. They were not so large as the dragonish monsters I had shot at\r\nin West Africa, but large enough to disturb the social centre of any\r\nEnglish green. Two or three hundred yards away from the village wells\r\nthe little squares and oblongs of fields were absolutely bare, not a\r\nweed showing. For miles on miles the drab surface of the earth was\r\nhard and barren as a brick pavement.\r\n\r\nThe famine in Orissa was due to flood—an unforeseen calamity—and\r\nthough the area was small in comparison, the horror of the starvation\r\nwas much worse than anything in the United Provinces. The effect of\r\ndrought can be foreseen, and it is one of the Government’s recognized\r\nfunctions to keep people alive in famine. Preparations for relief\r\nhad begun in October, and at the head of the administration stood\r\nSir John Hewett, the Lieutenant-Governor, in whom all Indians felt\r\na peculiar confidence. But apart from his special influence, it is\r\nin famine time, as I have noticed before, that the zeal and sympathy\r\nof our officials are seen at their best. Men who in ordinary seasons\r\nwould treat all Indians alike with habitual contumely, are perfectly\r\nwilling to die for them in their distress, and once I travelled in a\r\ncabin with a high legal official in Allahabad, not connected in any\r\nway with relief, whose voyage out was made more and more miserable,\r\nbecause at every port came the news of continued drought in the\r\nprovince. Such sympathy from above is a memory of our old land-owning\r\ntraditions, a relic of noblesse and its obligations, and, as long as\r\nour superiority is as undisputed as a captain’s or a curate’s, we are\r\nparticularly successful in exercising this devoted patronage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOING TO WORK.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RELIEF SHELTERS.]\r\n\r\nAs no rain fell, “test works” were established in December. On test\r\nworks heavy tasks like road-making are set, and no payment is given\r\nunless the work is done. Nothing but real poverty and hunger will\r\ndrive people to work of this kind, and so, when two thousand men\r\nwere found to be labouring at each of the test works, it was assumed\r\nthat hunger was general, and “a state of famine” was officially\r\nproclaimed. A state of famine implies relief works on which the\r\nGovernment pays a fixed rate of wages to all workers, and assistance\r\nof some kind is given to every one—women, children, babies, and the\r\nold, as well as the able-bodied workers. The rate is decided by the\r\nFamine Commissioner according to his estimate of the price of grain.\r\nIn this case he had calculated the price of grain for the time being\r\nat 18 lb. (9 seers) to the rupee (1_s._ 4_d._). By the “Wages Table\r\nfor Public Works,” which is as easy to work with and as indisputable\r\nas a table of logarithms, this price gave the rate of wages at 2_d._\r\na day for diggers, whether men or women (but hardly any women consent\r\nto dig), 1½_d._ a day for carriers of earth (chiefly women), 1_d._\r\nfor children, and ½_d._ a day for babies.[55]\r\n\r\nA few exceptional cases are specially treated. Any woman, for\r\ninstance, who presents the works with a new baby is rewarded with a\r\nspecial donation of 1_s._ 4_d._ down. The wages were paid out of a\r\nguarded treasure tent every afternoon, and the people bought their\r\nown food from local merchants, who generally conveyed the grain on\r\nthe backs of bullocks from Allahabad. The women ground it themselves,\r\nand made it into a sticky paste with a little salt, and that was what\r\nthe families lived upon. Drinking water was served from kerosene\r\ntins by Brahmans so that none might be defiled.\r\n\r\nVillagers in want of the wage looked round the plain at sunrise\r\nfor a red flag hoisted on a long pole. That showed the “recruiting\r\nstation,” and there the families congregated in long rows, waiting\r\nto be allotted to gangers chosen from their own number. If any\r\nwere already too starved for labour, they were fed up to working\r\npoint; but there were none of the brown skeletons here that I saw in\r\nOrissa, because, as the disaster was not sudden, the relief had begun\r\nwhile the people were still in good condition. When the gangs were\r\narranged, they were led out to some allotted portion of the works,\r\nthe fellow-villagers remaining together for the stimulus of public\r\nopinion. In other districts the relief works took the form of new\r\nroads, but where I was the engineers had designed two great bunds\r\nor dams to catch the monsoon rains over a large and gently sloping\r\narea. For a few months each year shallow tanks would thus be formed,\r\nwhich could be tapped as required for the fields at a lower level,\r\nand, when dry, would leave a surface enriched with silt and moisture.\r\nThe dams were called Garhaiya Kalan and Telghana from neighbouring\r\nvillages, and one was seven miles long, the other a mile and a half.\r\nIf these were not sufficient for the winter’s relief work, many\r\nmore might be constructed, and the Government could always hope to\r\nrecover part of the outlay by the increased value of the land, for\r\nwhich the landowners (zemindars) would as usual have to pay about\r\nhalf their income as revenue. And as I thought of it, I sighed for\r\nthe orgy of battleships and old age pensions which we should enjoy\r\nif only our Government at home could scoop up the unearned increment\r\nlike that!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ON THE RELIEF WORKS.\r\n\r\n  [_Face p. 276._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe process of constructing the dams was simple. Engineers had fixed\r\nthe required levels and breadths by upright poles with strings\r\nstretched between them, and all that the workers had to do was to\r\npile up earth till the strings were just covered and disappeared\r\nfrom sight. The earth was cut from both sides of the dam, and each\r\ndigger’s daily task, with the help of a woman carrier, was to clear\r\na plot of earth 13 ft. by 8 ft., and 1 ft. deep. A pick and hoe were\r\nsupplied by Government, but the natives refused the new English-made\r\ntools, not from any Swadeshi prejudice, but because they were rotten\r\nand would not cut. Women carried the earth in baskets made in the\r\ngaols and threw it on the dam. Weaker women, cripples and children\r\nbroke up the clods, patting them rather gently with wooden implements\r\ntill the surface was fairly smooth and solid. That was all the work.\r\nIf the allotted task fell short, the payment of the whole gang of\r\nfellow-villagers was reduced, so that each worker had an interest\r\nin keeping all his friends up to the mark, and I did not hear any\r\ncomplaints about reductions. What I did hear were the common\r\ncomplaints of humanity that bellies were not full, that dealers\r\ngave short weight, and that some parts of the ground were harder to\r\ndig than others. By that time there were twenty thousand workers\r\non relief in this small district alone, and the numbers were daily\r\nincreasing. When people have to be saved by averages of thousands\r\ntogether, how can you stop to give complete satisfaction? It is not\r\nso that heaven is filled.\r\n\r\nThe hope was that, as the famine had been taken in time, the cholera,\r\nwhich comes in the rearward of famine, might be avoided; and it was.\r\nThe only definite disease I noticed was a very common paralysis of\r\nthe knees, which crippled both men and women, but was not directly\r\ndue to famine. The people themselves attributed it to a kind of\r\npea they eat, and the pea had lately been forbidden to be sold on\r\nGovernment works. I had seen the same kind of paralysis in the stone\r\nquarries at Les Baux in Provence, where it was attributed to the\r\ndust; but it seems hard to connect the two cases. Otherwise, the\r\npeople were as healthy as one can be on an average of 1½_d._ a day.\r\nMost of them went back to their own villages in the evening. For\r\nthose who lived too far away tiny huts or coverts of bamboo frames\r\nthatched with straw were provided. When the dams were finished, they\r\nwere to be “departmentally watched and maintained.”\r\n\r\nWhen I saw Sir John Hewett a short time afterwards at Agra, he\r\ntold me he had over 150,000 workers on the relief works, and over\r\n310,000 receiving relief of one kind or another. Owing to the famine\r\nthe yield of grain in his province was 3,500,000 tons below the\r\nnormal; rice yielded only a quarter of the average; and £4,000,000\r\nhad been lost on the sugar and cotton crops combined. To meet the\r\nscarcity, Government had already suspended 120 lakhs (£800,000) of\r\nland revenue, a large part of which would be permanently remitted,\r\nand had advanced about £1,000,000 for relief, the purchase of seed,\r\nand sinking of temporary wells. Speaking at Lucknow a few days later\r\n(January 25, 1908) Sir John Hewett said:—\r\n\r\n  “These measures have given heart to the people, provided occupation\r\n  in the villages at remunerative rates of wages, and prevented the\r\n  occurrence of crime. The people themselves have met the crisis in\r\n  the most commendable spirit. Never was there a famine in which the\r\n  people and the Government and its officers showed a more united\r\n  front than the present one. The ryots have toiled early and late to\r\n  prepare and sow their fields for the spring harvest, and they have\r\n  not toiled in vain.”\r\n\r\nThat speech was made, however, after blessed rain had fallen. When\r\nI was at Agra, one inch of rain suddenly fell in one night, and I\r\nshall not forget the joyful change upon the faces of the officials.\r\nIt must be remembered also that, excellent as the administration of\r\nthe famine relief was, and fully as the Lieutenant-Governor deserves\r\nhis popularity, the United Provinces is probably a district all the\r\neasier to govern just because it is comparatively backward, and\r\nout of its population of nearly 50,000,000 about 70 per cent. are\r\ndirectly dependent upon agriculture for their living.[56]\r\n\r\nIn his Financial Statement to the Viceroy’s Council (March 20, 1908),\r\nMr. E. N. Baker, now Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, calculated that\r\nthe famine of the year had affected an area with a population of\r\nabout 49 millions. It had raised the price of wheat so high that\r\nthe export from India had almost wholly stopped, while the Burma\r\nrice crop had been diverted to India to take the place of what was\r\nlost. He estimated the amount of takavi advances, or village loans\r\nfor wells, seed, etc., for the preceding and present years together\r\nat 4 crores of rupees (about £2,650,000), and the amount of revenue\r\nsuspended for the two years at nearly 360 lakhs (nearly £2,400,000),\r\nof which a large proportion must be permanently remitted. The total\r\nloss to the State by loss of revenue and increase of expenditure\r\ncombined he estimated at 985 lakhs (about £6,633,000) for the two\r\nyears. He added the significant comment:—\r\n\r\n  “The distress caused by high prices has undoubtedly affected\r\n  all classes, and has pressed with great severity on the urban\r\n  populations, and on all who are dependent on small fixed incomes.\r\n  But the more painful conditions which we associate with widespread\r\n  famine in India—the emaciation, the aimless wandering, the\r\n  disruption of social ties, and the increase of crime—are as yet\r\n  so rare and exceptional as to be scarcely noticeable. The energy\r\n  and determination with which the people have themselves faced the\r\n  calamity have been observed on all hands, and we may reasonably\r\n  hope that if the coming season is favourable the progress of the\r\n  country will resume its normal course, without any such check as a\r\n  famine on a similar scale would have caused in bygone times.”[57]\r\n\r\nThat sounds fairly simple, and, of course, its hopefulness was\r\njustified; but the whole question of the famine brought one up short\r\nagainst problems that may be common to all countries, but are perhaps\r\nmore difficult in India, because under our rule the economic stages\r\nare becoming mixed together. What Mr. Baker, for instance, says about\r\nthe pressure upon urban populations and small fixed incomes owing to\r\nthe famine is true; but then the pressure appears to be permanent,\r\nfamine or no famine. The rise in price of ordinary provisions seems\r\nto be continuous and general. I heard the same complaint in the\r\nDeccan, in Eastern Bengal, Calcutta, Benares, Allahabad, Delhi, and\r\nLahore. Within twenty years wages may have doubled, but the cost\r\nof common food has quadrupled. In Bengal, for example, Mr. Chunder\r\nNath Bose, Fellow of the Calcutta University, who knew the prices\r\nas a boy, says they have gone up fourfold or even tenfold for the\r\nstaples of Bengal diet, such as rice, wheat, potatoes, brinjal, dal,\r\nfish, and, what is worst, for milk and ghi (clarified butter).[58]\r\nMany explanations were given me by English and Indian alike—the\r\nexport of grain, the growth of jute, the fixing of the rupee, the\r\nincreased circulation of rupees before 1893, and the transition from\r\npayment in kind to payment in cash. Some of these explanations are\r\ncontradictory, and all of them have been vehemently contradicted. But\r\nas to the result, there appeared to be no doubt: life is becoming\r\nharder for all working people, especially for all workers on fixed\r\nincomes, and the only people who do not notice the increasing burden\r\nare the few with “rapidly expanding business” and those who could not\r\npossibly eat up to their incomes if they tried.\r\n\r\nIt was still more difficult to discover the real condition of the\r\npeasants and labourers in the country compared to the workpeople in\r\nthe towns. In villages near the relief works, the cultivators (ryots)\r\ntold me they paid sometimes one and sometimes ten rupees a bigha\r\n(rather over half an acre) to the zemindar, but their average rent\r\nappeared to be about two rupees a bigha (say 5_s._ 6_d._ an acre).\r\nSome said they thought they made or saved ten or even twenty rupees\r\na year for marriages, births, funerals, ceremonies, and pilgrimages.\r\nBut nearly all of them said they saved nothing. They admitted,\r\nhowever, that for a daughter’s marriage a ryot would sometimes\r\nspend as much as two hundred rupees, borrowed from the zemindar\r\nor banya (money-lender), and when I asked one of them what he\r\nborrowed on if he had no savings, he replied that he borrowed on his\r\n“respectability,” which is, I suppose, what most people borrow on.\r\nAt the back of the borrower’s mind, I think, is the continual hope\r\nfor a “bumper” crop that will start him free again, but as the rate\r\nof interest without solid security was anything from 25 to 36 per\r\ncent. both here and in the Punjab, the ryot often became little more\r\nthan a labourer in the employment of the money-lender, who advanced\r\nhim seed and stock and took the crop. In a village outside Lahore I\r\nfound the cultivators had agreed among themselves not to spend money\r\non marriages in future, though these village festivals had been their\r\nonly joy, and now, unless a juggler or reciter came round, they had\r\nnothing whatever to break the monotony of toil upon the land—not even\r\na school. Neither were there any schools in the villages I visited\r\nnear Allahabad, nor in those near Delhi.\r\n\r\nBut though in many cases the ryot had become little better than a\r\nlabourer in the employment of a landowner or money-lender, there was\r\nstill a recognized class of landless labourers below him. In the\r\nvillages near the relief works the labourer (who is always paid in\r\nkind) got 2½ lbs. of grain for a day’s work from dawn to dark with\r\ntwo hours off, and he could count on work most of the year if the\r\nrains were good. He also received one pair of shoes, one cloth, and\r\nground for his hut, which he built himself. Some of the labourers\r\ntold me of a further gift of three rupees a year (4_s._) which seemed\r\nto be a kind of Christmas-box. If the wife worked she got 1⅛ lb.\r\nof grain a day. Turned into money, at the village price of grain,\r\nthe labourer’s wage would thus be about 2_d._ a day, apart from his\r\nwife’s earnings (say 1_d._) and the extras I have mentioned.[59]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SWADESHI WEAVERS, BOMBAY MILLS.\r\n\r\nSWADESHI WEAVERS, MADRAS HAND-LOOMS.\r\n\r\n  [_Face p. 284._\r\n]\r\n\r\nBeside the money-lender, the landowner, the cultivator, and the\r\nlabourer, I found in every village one or two artisans, though the\r\ndivision of industry was not exact, and some of the artisans did\r\na little agriculture as well. Nearly all villages seem to have a\r\nbarber, a potter, a carpenter, “sweepers” or scavengers, and one or\r\ntwo priestly families to perform the common rites that mankind wants,\r\nto bless the harvest, foretell the weather, and control the local\r\nghosts. In some villages I also found the hand-loom weaver, and in a\r\nMohammedan village near Lahore the weaver told me he could make ten\r\nyards a day, which he valued at five annas, his wife spinning the\r\nyarn by walking to and fro as on a rope-walk. In the same village\r\nthe carpenter was specially employed on making water-wheels. But the\r\nvillage artisans, as a rule, are not paid by the job but are allowed\r\na fairly regular income by the village, each family contributing so\r\nmany measures of grain at each of the two harvests for their support.\r\nFor instance, the village priest gets about 5 lb. of grain per plough\r\nat harvest, but the potter gets 20 lb. per plough and the carpenter\r\n50 lb.[60]\r\n\r\nAs far as mere money-value goes, it is not very hard to compare the\r\nearnings of village labourers and artisans with the earnings of\r\nworkpeople in the towns. In the eighty or ninety cotton mills of\r\nBombay, for instance, the average man’s wages are 18 rupees a month,\r\nor a little over 10_d._ a day; a woman’s highest wage is a fraction\r\nunder 7_d._ a day, and half-time children, nominally over nine years\r\nold and under fourteen, get 2¾_d._ a day, which is more than the\r\naverage labourer’s wage in the village. At a mill in Delhi I found\r\nthe wages were less—12 rupees a month instead of 18 for men, and 6\r\nrupees instead of 8 for boys; but the hours of labour were twelve\r\nwith one hour off instead of thirteen with (nominally) only half an\r\nhour off. In reality, I think it would be quite impossible to get\r\nIndians to do what Lancashire people would call work for twelve or\r\nthirteen hours at a stretch, with only those little breaks. At all\r\nevents, it is not done.\r\n\r\nBy the measure of money, then, the Bombay mill-hand would seem to\r\nbe about five times better off than the village labourer of the\r\nUnited Provinces. In so far as most people enjoy living in swarms\r\nrather than in isolation, he is better off; but otherwise the lot\r\nof both is perhaps almost equally unenviable. The hours in a Bombay\r\nmill are spent in monotonous labour, among hideous noise, and in a\r\nfluffy atmosphere, where there are no fans to decrease the dust, the\r\nheat, or the smell. All round the factories, workmen’s dwellings, or\r\n“chawls,” have sprung up, usually in galleries of single rooms along\r\nthe first floor above a row of open shops. The average rent is one\r\nrupee (1_s._ 4_d._) a week for a room, and the whole family lives\r\nin one room, in which, as a rule, there is no window but the door.\r\nMost families are saved a lot of dusting and breakages by having no\r\nfurniture except a metal cooking-pot for the rice and dal—a sort of\r\nsplit pea. These are cooked in cocoanut oil, and form the almost\r\ninvariable food, though in one black hole I did see a woman\r\ncooking something that smelt like the ghost of a fish, and sometimes\r\na family launched out into a maize pancake. In one or two rooms there\r\nwere real decorations—portraits of Rama, of Krishna, or the King—and\r\nfor a week every doorway was hung with a string of dry leaves, ears\r\nof rice, and little crimson flowers like knapweed, in memory, I\r\nsuppose, of some old village festival. All night long, under a waning\r\nmoon, the mill hands sat in the verandahs of these wretched homes,\r\nbeating drums, and chanting their barbaric scales—“praising God,”\r\nas they said when we asked them; but what form of God, or for what\r\nreason they praised Him, they could not explain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WORKMEN’S DWELLINGS, BOMBAY.\r\n\r\n  [_Face p. 286._\r\n]\r\n\r\nVillagers, of course, retained the usual advantages of country\r\nlife—fresh air, purer food, and greater bodily freedom and variety\r\nin labour. But the inner conditions of life were otherwise much\r\nthe same. In furniture, even the fairly well-to-do cultivators\r\nseldom went beyond a fireplace (usually outside), a grain store,\r\na plank bed, some rags, some brass pots and dishes, and in rare\r\ncases a few silver ornaments on the legs and arms of the women as\r\nthe most convenient bank. All necessary architecture, even in mud\r\nhovels, is beautiful, and so are all implements for human use,\r\nbut I never saw any attempt at decoration or conscious beauty. It\r\nwould be absurd to call the Indian peasants ignorant, for they\r\nunderstand their own business quite as well as we understand ours,\r\nand in their own knowledge they have little to learn. But in most\r\nvillages the isolation and absence of schools make them unnecessarily\r\nsuperstitious and apprehensive of unreal dangers. Almost within sight\r\nof Lahore, the women rushed away to the flat roof-tops with their\r\nchildren for fear I should blight their souls, and the men could not\r\nimagine what I might be, except a revenue collector, a pill doctor,\r\nor an official come to poison the wells with plague. Near Delhi the\r\nwomen turned their faces sharply to the wall at my shadow, and lived\r\nin perpetual terror of “soldiers,” though for no definite reason. At\r\nthe foot of the Himalaya up from Hardwar, no one in the village had\r\nheard of the Viceroy, or of the Congress, or of Lajpat Rai, though\r\nit was little more than twenty-four hours’ journey from Lahore. Only\r\none man knew what a newspaper was, or had ever seen one, and neither\r\nhe nor any one else could have read a word of it. One old man said he\r\nknew they were governed by England, but he had no notion what sort of\r\na thing England was. Another old man in a village within ten miles of\r\nDelhi told me that, although he knew nothing about England, he was\r\ngrateful to the English because when he was a boy his grandfather\r\nused to tell him of horrible murders and lootings, but there were\r\nhardly any of such terrors now. And as that was one of the few nice\r\nthings I heard about ourselves in India, I will conclude with it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOMBAY MILL-HANDS.\r\n\r\n  [_Face p. 288._\r\n]\r\n\r\nBut the central problems remain untouched—the problems of the\r\nfamines, the rise in prices, and of the poverty, which is probably\r\nincreasing. Is the rainfall permanently growing less, and, if so,\r\nhave the alterations in the Nile anything to do with it? Is the\r\ndistress more terrible because the cultivators sell their grain,\r\nlargely for export, instead of hoarding some proportion of it? Or is\r\nit true that they ever hoarded it? Is it want of money rather than\r\nwant of grain that is bringing ruin on the people? All these things\r\nare said.[61] But I would point out one simple and obvious thing\r\nabout the famine district that I visited in the United Provinces. The\r\nland there by its direct and immediate yield was expected to support,\r\nin the first place, the Government, with its expensive army and civil\r\nservice; in the second place, the landowners (zemindars) who usually\r\ndid the same kind of work as our landowners at home—collecting rents;\r\nin the third place, the farmers (ryots), who sold the crops, paid\r\nthe rent, and worked themselves when poverty compelled them; in the\r\nfourth place, the labourers, who worked in good years and starved in\r\nbad; in the fifth place, the artisans, who worked for civilization\r\nand decency; in the sixth place, the priests, who worked for\r\nreligion and the soul; and in the seventh place, the money-lenders,\r\nwho scooped up an interest of about 30 per cent. when they could get\r\nit. Patient as this old earth is, it seems to me that in parts of\r\nIndia her patience is a little overburdened.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[53] “The Industrial Organization of an Indian Province,” p. 241.

A few score\r\nof boys and young men were gathered round a small square pit, in\r\nwhich a fire of dry sticks was burning with a yellow flame. They were\r\ndressed in long cotton cloths of yellow or white, and, sitting in\r\nrows, they chanted the ancient Vedic hymns in praise of God, with the\r\npeculiar intervals and nasal quaverings of the East. In their midst,\r\nby the edge of the pit, sat their Guru, or teacher, and from time\r\nto time he ladled clarified butter into the fire, while youths from\r\neach of the other sides of the square threw in handfuls of rice and\r\nfragrant woods or herbs. Meantime the chanting never ceased, but with\r\na concentrated vehemence all raised to the air the eternal Sanscrit\r\nwords, revealed to the Aryan race before recorded history, so that\r\nthey might never be devoid of the holiest wisdom, but bear it with\r\nthem across mountains of ice and over sunburnt plains to the furthest\r\nworld. At the end, all stood up for the final evening hymn, and then\r\ndispersed, leaving the fire burning as a symbol of man’s soul, and of\r\nthe divine power, and of the transfiguration of the spirit by flame\r\nand purity.\r\n\r\nThat form of worship is celebrated every morning and evening by all\r\nVedic believers, whether assembled or alone. But I saw it first at\r\none of the students’ homes in Lahore, where a branch of the Arya\r\nSamaj, or Aryan Society, has a school and an “Anglo-Vedic College,”\r\nnumbering about 1800 members together. Lala Lajpat Rai sat next\r\nme, for it was to this branch that he had devoted all his labours\r\nfor social and religious reform, till injustice drove him to turn\r\naside into politics from the true objects of the Samaj. I speak of\r\na branch because, like most vital movements, the Samaj is divided\r\ninto parties, one holding its services inside the crowded old city\r\nitself, the other just outside the ancient walls. As usually happens,\r\nthe two parties in the religion have split on unessential points,\r\nfor which they are prepared to die, though not to kill. But both\r\nclaim to follow the doctrines of their founder, Dayananda Saraswati,\r\nwho quitted this stage of existence at Ajmere in 1883, after a\r\nwandering life of holy poverty given up entirely to the denunciation\r\nof idols, caste restrictions, animal sacrifices, licentious rites,\r\nthe multiplicity of deities, and other accretions with which frail\r\nhumanity has surrounded the stern purity of the Vedic revelation.\r\n\r\nLeaving his home as an outcast rather than submit to the carnal\r\nmarriage tie, Dayananda spent sixteen years of youth and early\r\nmanhood in walking from one holy place of Northern India to\r\nanother. Sometimes he passed into Kashmir, thrice he crossed the\r\nsnow mountains into Thibet, and, hungry for wisdom, he sought\r\neverywhere for the teacher at whose feet he might enjoy it. At\r\nlast he found wisdom near at hand, in those very scriptures on\r\nwhich he had meditated day and night, and full of reforming zeal he\r\nturned to Benares and other seats of religious learning where he\r\nmight confute the Pundits, whose obscure minds darkened the hard\r\nradiance of God’s Sanscrit word. In city after city public debates\r\nwere held before immense audiences, Dayananda in solitary knowledge\r\nopposing the priestly hostility of all the teachers combined, while\r\nas a rule, the local representative of the British Empire was\r\ninvited to take the chair and see fair play, or award the prize in\r\nsubtleties of theological controversy. The latter was a task for\r\nwhich our public-school education does not specially adapt us, but\r\nas a rule the British representative was spared the difficulty of\r\nmetaphysical decision by the Pundits themselves, who violently broke\r\nup the meeting under consciousness of defeat. Perhaps unhappily\r\nfor his cause, Dayananda did not confine himself to the purgation\r\nof Hindu superstitions and social abuses, but was equally vehement\r\nin his attacks upon the unworthy additions and compromises that\r\nhave gathered round Christianity and Islam; and to his success in\r\ninterrupting the process of conversion among Hindus we may trace the\r\nmarked hostility with which Christian and Mohammedan missionaries\r\nhave always regarded the Samaj.[62]\r\n\r\nThe first branch of the society was established in Bombay by\r\nDayananda himself in 1875, but its real strength now lies in the\r\nPunjab and United Provinces, in both of which together it numbers\r\nabout 250,000 members. The two parties into which the Samaj in Lahore\r\nis to some extent divided, as I said, both unite in rejecting idols,\r\nand in condemning the seclusion or “purdah” of women, the dangerous\r\nprerogatives of the priesthood, and all restrictions of caste,\r\nexcept such rights and obligations as are the due of character or\r\nintellect. Both unite in maintaining the unity of God, the eternal\r\ntrinity of God, Soul, and Matter, and the universal wisdom revealed\r\nfor all races in the Vedas. The differences that divide them are,\r\nperhaps, rather of temperament than of doctrine. The party that\r\nworships in the city claims to be more democratic in its appeal,\r\nto be stricter in life and discipline, but at the same time freer\r\nfrom “purdah”; and, indeed, its women are allowed to attend divine\r\nservice in a gallery unveiled, while the women of the other party\r\nhave a service to themselves, with a woman preacher, whose sermons I\r\nwas, unhappily, unable to attend. The city party has been called the\r\nCulture Section, in which name, I think, there lies a covert sneer.\r\nBut it briskly retaliated by calling the suburban party the Vulture\r\nSection, in which the sneer is not covert at all, but palpably due to\r\na backsliding from vegetarianism.\r\n\r\nNot that the extra-mural party itself dreams of backsliding. It\r\nonly aims at progress and increasing freedom in social life; for,\r\nlike other great movements of religious reform, it maintains that\r\nthe kingdom of heaven is not meat and drink. The differences, in\r\nfact, have never been serious, though a few years ago there was the\r\nsame tender hostility as used to prevail between Newton Hall and\r\nLamb’s Conduit Street, when Positivists turned their criticism from\r\nChristians to each other. But of late persecution, which makes all\r\nits victims friends, has brought them together again, and few of the\r\noutside world are now aware of any division. It was the deportation\r\nof Lajpat Rai that gave the final touch to reconcilement. That a man\r\nof austere and generous life, one who had given up great worldly\r\nsuccess for the service of the poor and unlearned, should be spirited\r\naway without warning and without trial for venturing to criticize\r\nofficial injustice—that was the touch to kindle the indignant fire\r\nwhich welds men into one.\r\n\r\nLajpat Rai was one of those men into whose soul the wrongs of their\r\npeople enter. By nature averse from politics, he devoted himself to\r\nthose deeper questions which lie beyond the touch of governments\r\ngood or bad, and it was not till he was forty that the decisive\r\nchange came. It is true that he joined the Congress movement in 1888,\r\nwithin two or three years of its beginning; but no one has more\r\nseverely criticized the Congress and its methods—its unwieldy size,\r\nits holiday aspect, its failure to touch the poverty and ignorance\r\nof India, and its mistaken confidence in the power of speeches and\r\nresolutions for the redress of political wrongs.[63]\r\n\r\nIt was significant of his strength of character and indifference to\r\npopularity, that after the breach in the Surat Congress, he gave\r\nhis immense influence to the Moderate party, and declared he would\r\nfight under the old banner, as I have described. But it was still\r\nmore characteristic that, when the Congress had vanished, he remained\r\nin Surat for the Social and Swadeshi Conferences, and organized a\r\nfamine-relief fund there, just as if nothing had happened.\r\n\r\nDeeper things than can be reached by Government or speeches have\r\noccupied his life. Born at Jaguran, in the district of Ludhiana,\r\nwhere his father taught Persian and Urdu, he became a student at the\r\nGovernment College in Lahore, and a Pleader in the Courts there\r\njust at the time when the Arya Samaj was engaged in its earliest\r\nstruggle for religious and social reform.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LALA LAJPAT RAI.\r\n\r\n_Photo by P. Girdhar Roy & Sons, Lahore._\r\n\r\n  [_Face p. 296._\r\n]\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of Hans Raj, now the Principal of the Anglo-Vedic\r\nCollege, a direct and silent man of similar austerity and devotion of\r\nlife, he joined the Samaj and threw himself into its conflict against\r\nidol-worship, child-marriage, girl-widowhood, caste subdivisions, and\r\nthe other abuses of orthodox Hinduism. Poverty, ignorance, and famine\r\nappeared to him the chief outward and visible evils of his country,\r\nand for many years, in the intervals of heavy professional work,\r\nhe lived the life of what one would call a philanthropist, if the\r\nword had not gathered round it the inhuman associations of charity.\r\nHe directed orphanages, superintended education, helped to found\r\nSwadeshi banks and mills long before Swadeshi became a political\r\nweapon; he administered famine funds—with a side-glance at the\r\nunhappy “famine Christians,” the Samajists say he rescued thousands\r\nof souls from famine and conversion—and one of his great achievements\r\nwas the relief of the destitute in the Kangra valley after the\r\nterrible earthquake of 1905.\r\n\r\nBut I think that year marked a change. So far, beyond attending the\r\nCongress and publishing two vernacular pamphlets on Mazzini and\r\nGaribaldi—dangerous themes, I admit, for a member of any subject\r\nrace—his action had not been political. In that year he went to\r\nEngland, like Mr. Gokhale, to represent the cause of Indian reform,\r\nand he also visited America. It so happened that he found England\r\non the verge of the greatest Liberal revival. She appeared to have\r\nawakened from the ten years’ incubus of reaction and Imperialistic\r\nmisgovernment. Hopes of reform went hand in hand with hatred of\r\noppression. He noticed the movements of the unemployed, the devotion\r\nof passive resisters, the sympathies with oppressed nationalities,\r\nthe rapid recovery from the fever of the Boer war. He noticed that\r\neven on such a question as bringing the trams across the bridges\r\nthe Lords were threatened with a revolution in the ordering of the\r\nState.[64] The same spirit of freedom appeared to be at work in other\r\nparts of the world—in Ireland, Japan, Egypt, Persia, and especially\r\nin Russia. It was natural that the ideal of winning for his own\r\npeople a true share in the government of their country should be\r\nstrengthened.\r\n\r\nUnhappily, Lajpat Rai also observed in England that the people\r\nwere too much occupied with the overwhelming problems confronting\r\nthemselves to pay close attention to a subject so distant and\r\nabstruse as Indian reform. He observed that in English politics\r\nthe cause of justice had no chance unless it were made a party\r\nquestion, and the Liberal Party refused to make Indian reform a party\r\nquestion, because, while it did not move the people at large, it\r\ntouched too many important interests. As to the upper classes, he\r\nfound, as Ruskin had found long before, that “every mutiny, every\r\ndanger, every crime occurring under our Indian legislation arose\r\ndirectly out of our native desire to live on the loot of India.” Only\r\nfrom the Irish and Labour Parties did his mission receive any real\r\nencouragement, and, owing to the executive weakness of those two\r\nparties, he concluded—one may still hope too hastily—that any appeal\r\nto the justice and benevolence of Great Britain as represented by her\r\nParliament was vain:—\r\n\r\n  “You can at times,” he wrote, “successfully appeal to the\r\n  humanity and benevolence of individuals, but to hope for justice\r\n  and benevolence from a nation is hoping against hope. The rule\r\n  of a foreign democracy is, in this respect the most dangerous.\r\n  The democracy is swayed by so many diverse interests that it\r\n  is impossible to expect anything like unanimity or even a\r\n  preponderance of opinion in dealing justly with a subject race,\r\n  because justice to a subject race often clashes with the interest\r\n  of some class of the ruling democracy. Whenever an attempt is made\r\n  to do justice to the subject race, that class rises up, raises a\r\n  storm, and prevents the Government from doing the right thing. Look\r\n  at the history of the cotton duties in India, and every one will\r\n  see the truth of this. How many times has the Government of India\r\n  been overruled in the matter, simply because the Home Government\r\n  cannot afford to risk the opposition of Lancashire and incur its\r\n  displeasure!”[65]\r\n\r\nHe returned to India convinced that the political as well as the\r\nsocial salvation of the country rested only with the Indian peoples\r\nthemselves. As to means, he looked to anything that would promote\r\npolitical knowledge, courage, and self-reliance. At one time he seems\r\nto have contemplated a kind of Teaching Order, something like Mr.\r\nGokhale’s “Servants of India.”\r\n\r\n  “Where are the political thinkers of the country,” he cried, “whose\r\n  sole thought by day and night, sleeping or waking, would be how\r\n  to initiate and carry on the struggle for freedom? Where are the\r\n  political Sanyasis (wandering friars) whose sole work in life would\r\n  be the preaching of the gospel of freedom? Were are the Vaishyas\r\n  of the movement who will make money only for the struggle: who\r\n  will live poorly and modestly and save every farthing for the\r\n  sacred cause?... Where are the people who will raise agitation for\r\n  political rights and liberty to the dignity of a Church and will\r\n  live and die for the same?”[66]\r\n\r\nHe believed that the only way to win the consideration of England\r\nfor reforms was to prove the determination and self-reliance of the\r\nIndians themselves.\r\n\r\n  “The British are not a spiritual people,” he said. “They are either\r\n  a fighting race or a commercial nation. It would be throwing pearls\r\n  before swine to appeal to them in the name of the higher morality\r\n  or justice or on ethical grounds. They are a self-reliant, haughty\r\n  people, who can appreciate self-respect and self-reliance even in\r\n  their opponents.”[67]\r\n\r\nIn a yielding disposition, a false prudence, a distrust of enthusiasm\r\nand energy, he found the real dangers of the Indian temperament.\r\n\r\n  “Our whole life from top to bottom smacks of fear,” he wrote,\r\n  “deadly fear of losing in the estimation of those whom we in our\r\n  heart of hearts believe to be only usurpers; fear of losing the\r\n  sunshine of the smile of those whom we believe to be day and night\r\n  engaged in the exploitation of our country and the spoliation of\r\n  our people, fear of offending the false gods that have by fraud or\r\n  force taken possessions of our bodies and souls, fear of being shut\r\n  up in a dungeon or prison house, as if the freedom that we enjoy\r\n  were not by its own nature one to be abhorred.”[68]\r\n\r\nHe was soon in his own person to prove the sincerity of his creed.\r\nThe condition of the Punjab during 1907 was particularly deplorable.\r\nFor thirteen years scarcity had prevailed almost without intermission\r\nin the south of the province, and the increasing poverty was only\r\nrelieved by the hideous mortality of the plague. Just before Lajpat\r\nRai’s deportation, the official record of deaths from plague in the\r\nPunjab alone rose to nearly 65,000 in one week, and the real number\r\nwas almost certainly higher. On the top of hunger and plague, which\r\nwe piously call the visitations of God, came the visitations of the\r\nGovernment in a largely increased revenue assessment, increased\r\nirrigation rates, the Colonization Bill threatening to break a\r\nsolemn promise made by Government to the Chenab settlers fifteen\r\nyears before, and the refusal of the Lieutenant-Governor to take\r\nany steps against the leading Anglo-Indian paper of Lahore for a\r\nseries of abusive articles against Indians, whilst Indian papers\r\nwere prosecuted and condemned for articles containing certainly no\r\ngreater incitement to racial animosity.[69] The feeling in the Punjab\r\nbecame intensely embittered. Local riots occurred at Lahore and Rawal\r\nPindi. Anglo-Indian journalists remembered that it was the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the Mutiny. Strange precautions were taken. English\r\npeople took refuge in the forts. In the haggard element of fear\r\nanything may assume a terrifying shape, and without trial or charge\r\nor warning, the most prominent member of the Arya Samaj was seized,\r\nand sent to Mandalay.[70]\r\n\r\nIt was all a little ironic, this treatment of a sad, retiring,\r\nclear-minded man, seeking neither advantage nor fame—one who had\r\nfreely given up his possessions, and worked for many years unknown\r\nat the humblest duties. When I was at Peshawar, I ventured to ask\r\none in authority why a man of such high reputation as Lajpat Rai\r\nshould have been selected for attack, and in defence of the Punjab\r\nGovernment, he said: “You see, it was just because he was so good\r\nthat they fired him. If he had been a rotter, they could have left\r\nhim alone.” I think it was as fine a compliment as any political\r\noffender could hope for.\r\n\r\nBut it was not entirely for his personal excellence that the Punjab\r\nGovernment struck at Lajpat Rai, nor for the wide influence of his\r\ndecisive eloquence. It was because they hoped to strike the Arya\r\nSamaj at the same time. The authorities in Northern India, always\r\ntimid and suspicious owing to the neighbourhood of the Frontier\r\nand the more warlike character of the peoples, had long regarded\r\nthe Samaj with special enmity. I have known a soldier, with papers\r\nof the highest character, turned out of a Sikh regiment admittedly\r\nfor belonging to the Samaj. Much of this suspicion arises from\r\nfalse information, such as is always supplied to officials who\r\nremain isolated from the surrounding people. The editor of the\r\n_Hindustan_, for instance, who had recently been sentenced to two\r\nyears’ imprisonment, was described as a graduate of the Anglo-Vedic\r\nCollege, though he had hardly been there a month, and owed the rest\r\nof his training to a Christian Mission School. In the same way\r\nyoung Ajit Singh, who was deported on suspicion of tampering with\r\nthe native troops, was described as a prominent Samajist, though he\r\nhad never belonged to the Samaj at all. Some members of the Society\r\nhave turned to politics, because for the moment the attraction is\r\nirresistible for many generous minds, and at such a time, as Disraeli\r\nsaid in “Sybil,” “to be young and to be indifferent are no longer\r\nsynonymous.” But the Samaj as such has no concern with politics.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ARYA SAMAJ TEACHER.\r\n\r\n  [_Face p. 304._\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt is a religious body—a Universal Church—bent only on religious\r\npurification and the training of youth in accordance with Vedic\r\nrules. One can understand the opposition of orthodox Hindus,\r\nMohammedans, and Christian missionaries, for in its religious\r\npropaganda the Samaj is distinctly militant and gathers in many\r\nconverts. But the Indian Government is mistaken in regarding it\r\nas a centre of sedition. The leaders of both sections—such men\r\nas Hans Raj, Principal of the Anglo-Vedic College in Lahore, and\r\nLala Munshi Rama, Governor of the Gurukula, near Hardwar—have\r\nsteadily set their faces against political work of any sort, and\r\nthey discourage political discussion among the students as strictly\r\nas the Risley Circular. It is useless, they say, to look for the\r\npolitical regeneration of India while the character and intellect of\r\nthe people are unregenerate. I do not agree with them, believing, as\r\nI do, that political freedom is essential for any regeneration\r\nof the national spirit. But to accuse the Samaj of political aims,\r\nto grasp at any forgery or lie which seeks to implicate the Society\r\nin sedition, are only signs of ignorance fixed in its isolation\r\namong a subject race. In the summer of 1907, Lala Munshi Rama wrote\r\na detailed defence of the Samaj on this point in the _Civil and\r\nMilitary Gazette_ of Lahore—a defence so just and reasonable that\r\neven the _Gazette_, conspicuous among Anglo-Indian papers for the\r\nvirulence of its anti-Indian feeling, described the “dignity of this\r\ndeeply pondered vindication” as commanding respect. In one passage he\r\nsaid:—\r\n\r\n  “It is an awful responsibility which these people undertake who\r\n  try to set the Government against the Arya Samaj, a Society which\r\n  is trying its best to uproot some of the evils of intemperance, of\r\n  impurity, of child-marriage, of polygamy, of gambling, and a host\r\n  of other vices—why, it is the Arya Samajists whom you find in the\r\n  foremost rank of workers in the field.”\r\n\r\nSix or seven years ago—in 1901 or early 1902—the writer of that\r\nprotest cleared a large open space in a pleasant jungle where in a\r\nsingle day I have still seen many deer and monkeys, many wild boars\r\nand jackals, the bone-strewn home of a tigress with cubs, the spoor\r\nof a huge elephant, wild peacocks perching in the trees, and nearly\r\nall the other delights of Eden, except Eve. A few miles away the\r\nholy Ganges issues from the foot of the Himalayas into the great\r\nIndian plain, and there stands the holy town of Hardwar, goal of\r\ngreat pilgrimages and pitch of many religious beggars, who keep with\r\nthem deformed cows and other holy monsters to move the hearts of\r\nworshippers to pity. On the open space in the jungle a quadrangle of\r\ntin-roofed buildings has been raised to be a Vedic school and future\r\ncollege. Over its gateway floats a red banner, inscribed with the\r\nsacred symbol of “Om,” and its Brahmacharya, or holy discipline,\r\nfollows the lines laid down by primeval revelation.\r\n\r\nThose lines are Spartan, or, at least, Platonic. The boys are\r\nadmitted at eight, and their parents take a solemn pledge not to\r\nremove them or allow their marriage till they are twenty-five, the\r\nlowest age fixed for a man’s marriage by the Vedic Scriptures.\r\nDuring these sixteen years the Brahmacharies, or disciples, do not\r\ngo home, nor are they allowed to write letters or receive them; but\r\ntheir parents may visit them once a month, and do, in fact, visit\r\nthem about twice a year. The great occasion for these visits is the\r\nschool anniversary, which happens to be St. Patrick’s Day, when over\r\nsixty thousand Samajists come, including many thousands of women,\r\nand encamp on the edge of the jungle in grass and wicker huts,\r\nwhich were being prepared for them during my stay in the school.\r\nUnlike the parents who come to see their sons on speech-days at our\r\npublic-schools, the pilgrim visitors bring their own supplies, and\r\nthey generally stay three days, that being all of family life the\r\nboys ever know. And that is all they know of woman’s society, too,\r\nfor it is, as I said, an Eveless Paradise.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A STREET IN HARDWAR.\r\n\r\nHARDWAR STRAND.\r\n\r\n  [_Face p. 306._\r\n]\r\n\r\nSuch isolation in the midst of our common and intermingled world\r\nis, perhaps, dangerous. It comes too near the inhuman monotony\r\nof workhouse schools. It is likely to exaggerate the desires and\r\ncuriosity of growing men, or to produce the hesitation of bashful and\r\nsecluded lives when confronted with the need for action. The entire\r\nremoval of home influence might appear harsh if we did not remember\r\nthe scores of men whom we have known ruined by their parents’\r\nvulgarity or their mothers’ indulgence. But even if we grant that\r\nmost parents are quite unfit to bring up children, sixteen years\r\nseems too long for any boy to remain in the same place, with the\r\nsame teachers and the same companions. Even the holiday excursions\r\nto historic cities of India, which are arranged by the Governor,\r\nand usually conducted by him, do not sufficiently break up the\r\none-sidedness of such a life; and think of the boy who is genuinely\r\nunfitted for school and is compelled to remain unhappy for a quarter\r\nof man’s existence!\r\n\r\nMr. Rama Deva, the young and highly educated head-master of the\r\nschool, and the other masters as well, met my scruples by urging\r\nthat in India the home influence is almost invariably dangerous\r\nor softening. They said their only hope of preserving the boys\r\nfrom child-marriage, maternal ignorance, and the evil of cities\r\nlay in this monastic seclusion. In place of parents they have a\r\nfew Superintendents—about one to every twenty-five of the 220 boys\r\nthen in the school—who live with each class day and night, except\r\nduring school hours. The greatest difficulty of the school is to\r\nfind Superintendents worthy and willing, and I should have thought\r\nit impossible. The three oldest boys in the top form have rooms to\r\nthemselves and no Superintendent. All sleep on plank beds, but are\r\nallowed a warm covering in winter. All dress in yellow “dhotis”\r\n(long cotton cloths) for schooltime, and in white “dhotis” for play.\r\nThey are allowed wooden sandals, held on by a peg between the toes,\r\nbut nearly all go barefoot, and with feet and legs bare they ride\r\nbareback and play cricket, football, and an Indian form of prisoners’\r\nbase. The school belongs to the Culture Section of the Arya Samaj,\r\nand is so violently vegetarian that I was not allowed to approach the\r\nbuildings in boots of murdered leather.\r\n\r\nThe boys get up at four in the morning, and attend Divine service\r\nround the symbolic fire. Having taken the vows of obedience, poverty,\r\nand chastity for sixteen years at their entrance, when two of those\r\nvows can mean very little to them, they are further taught to speak\r\nthe truth, to practise concentrated contemplation for a period of\r\nevery day, and to subdue passion by the “yoga” of deep breathing\r\nand holding the breath. They bathe in cold water before sunrise,\r\nthey climb the steep jungle mountains near, and all learn swimming\r\nin the Ganges. Almost the only form of punishment is exclusion from\r\nthe games. The school hours run to about seven, divided into two\r\nparts, and the chief subject taught is Sanscrit. There are the other\r\nordinary subjects—arithmetic and mathematics, history, science, and\r\nEnglish—and, unlike the Government schools, all teaching is given\r\nin the vernacular Hindi, so that the boys understand the subjects\r\nbetter, and can cover more ground, whereas in ordinary schools the\r\nlearning is continually hampered by the foreign tongue. But the\r\nchief means of education is Sanscrit, just as in my old school it\r\nwas Greek. At least seven years are spent in getting that amazing\r\nSanscrit grammar off by heart, and in learning to read the Vedas.\r\nWhether the Sanscrit literature is worth all that, I cannot say; we\r\nspent much the same time over Greek, and it was well worth it to\r\nabout one in twenty. But in all the upper forms, though none of the\r\nboys had yet approached the full age, they could already read and\r\nwrite Sanscrit as fluently as a mother tongue, and that is more than\r\nany of us ever did with Greek.\r\n\r\nBut the subject taught never matters much. The thing that does\r\nmatter is the manner of teaching, and nearly all the schools and\r\ncolleges I visited in India had the one common fault, that they tried\r\nto force knowledge into the mind by giving information. They treated\r\nthe mind as a passive vessel to be filled through the channel of the\r\nears. The method was by lecture, not by dialectic, and I at least\r\nhave never learnt anything by being lectured. If the officials wish\r\nto reform our system of education in India, here, at the very basis\r\nof teaching, is where they might begin. They will find they are far\r\ntoo late if they hope to stifle the national aspiration for liberty\r\nby excluding the study of our own history and the works of Western\r\nthinkers. Those are plants that we ourselves have generously set\r\nin India, and they are too deep-rooted to be pulled up now. But to\r\ntransform the ordinary teaching into real education would be a change\r\nindeed.\r\n\r\nThe Gurukula (the word means The Master’s Home) that I have been\r\ndescribing takes no Government grant, and submits to no Government\r\ninspection; nor is it affiliated to a Government University, like\r\nthe Anglo-Vedic College in Lahore. In the boarding houses of the\r\nAnglo-Vedic School and College a pupil’s total expenses come to 20\r\nor 25 rupees a month. In the Gurukula the parents pay 10 rupees a\r\nmonth (£8 a year) for the complete education, including clothes,\r\nfood, games, and all. But the cost for each boy is really\r\nabout £15 a year, and the deficit is made up by the subscriptions\r\nof the Samajists. Fifteen pounds a year is a great deal for a\r\npoverty-stricken country like India, but I wish our public schools\r\ndid not cost ten times as much. In the great Government school and\r\ncollege for Mohammedans at Aligarh the Principal told me the parents\r\npaid from 20 to 40 rupees a month according to the boy’s room (£16 to\r\n£32 a year). But that is a home of luxury, and I believe the money\r\nrequired to keep a son there often amounts to £45 or even £50 a year,\r\nas much as a third of the payment at one of our own public schools.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN THE GURUKULA.\r\n\r\n  [_Face p. 310._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[62] “Life and Teachings of Dayananda Saraswati,” by Bawa Chaju Singh\r\n(Lahore, 1903).\r\n\r\n[63] Speech at Lahore before the meeting of the Calcutta Congress,\r\n1906.\r\n\r\n[64] “Our Struggle for Freedom: How to Carry it on”; see “Lala Lajpat\r\nRai, the Man in his Word” (Madras, Ganesh and Co., 1907), p. 134-145.\r\n\r\n[65] _Ibid._, p. 197, “Indian Patriotism towards the Empire,” being\r\nan answer to a circular order from the Director of Public Instruction\r\nin the Punjab (May, 1906) requiring all schools to celebrate Empire\r\nDay in a certain manner.\r\n\r\n[66] _Ibid._, p. 141, “Our Struggle for Freedom.”\r\n\r\n[67] _Ibid._, p. 184, “The Swadeshi Movement.”\r\n\r\n[68] _Ibid._, p. 209, “The National Outlook.”\r\n\r\n[69] See Introduction, p. 17 ff.\r\n\r\n[70] For a full account of these events, see “The Story of My\r\nDeportation,” by Lajpat Rai (The Punjabi Press, Lahore, 1908).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nA FESTIVAL OF SPRING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mango trees were all in bloom, and the air full of their smell.\r\nIt has just the touch of turpentine in it that makes the mango fruit\r\nso pleasant, and is so refreshing in an English room that has been\r\nspring-cleaned with furniture polish. The mango bloom is the Indian\r\n“may,”—the sign that spring has come indeed, and that was why all\r\nthe great Sirdars, or landowners, of Baroda were gathered in the\r\npalace hall at nine o’clock one morning, and sat in thick rows of\r\nwhite-clad figures, with Mahratta turbans of red and gold on their\r\nheads, and curved swords glittering across their knees. The Maharajah\r\nhad summoned them in durbar, to celebrate the festival of Vasantha,\r\nor the Spring, and on the inlaid pavement below their seats a\r\nnautch-girl from Madras danced without ceasing, to the inspiriting\r\nnoise of three or four pipes and a little drum. All the instruments\r\nsounded their peculiar notes together, but apparently with random\r\nindependence, though the girl seemed to know what varied emotions\r\nthey would express. For she danced forward with gestures that she\r\nfelt to be suited to some imperceptible motive, her jewels flashing,\r\nand the heavy gold of her sash swinging over her knees. Then, having\r\nreached her limit of advance towards the empty throne, she walked\r\nquietly backwards, softly clapping her little brown hands to some\r\nimperceptible time.\r\n\r\nSuddenly from the palace garden came the sound of the tiny old\r\nguns which the British Government allows Native Rulers to retain\r\nfor saluting purposes, or to batter the mud walls of an occasional\r\nvillage, as evidence of their regal power. To the roar of this\r\nartillery the Maharajah entered, and, keeping step at his side, came\r\nthe British Resident, conspicuous in civilization’s clothing. Behind\r\nthem, stiff with scarlet and gold, stalked the British officers\r\nof a regiment quartered upon the State by the terms of an ancient\r\ntreaty. Passing up the pavement between the rows of Sirdars, the\r\nMaharajah took his seat upon the purple velvet sofa, having the\r\nBritish Resident side by side upon his right, while the British\r\nofficers settled into the topmost chairs, like a patch of poppies\r\nin a daisy field. All the time the pipes and drum never ceased,\r\nand the dancing-girl continued to advance and retire with various\r\nembellishments.\r\n\r\nAttendants appeared, bearing garlands and silver sprinklers, and\r\ntrim little bunches of flowers tightly tied up. The heaviest garland\r\nwas selected for the British Resident, and he bent his comely head\r\nsubmissively to receive it on his neck. It was made of white jasmine,\r\npicked out with silver “fairy rain,” which I have mentioned before\r\nas beautifying our Christmas-trees. He was also presented with a\r\ntight bunch of flowers, and lavishly sprinkled with scent from the\r\nsilver vessels. Similar but smaller garlands were then placed round\r\nthe necks of the British officers; similar but smaller bunches were\r\npresented to them, and they were sprinkled with scent, but less\r\nlavishly, as became their inferior position in the representation of\r\nBritain’s might. When the most junior subaltern had been sprinkled,\r\nthe Maharajah and the Resident rose, and the British contingent\r\nmarched out of the hall, the garlands flopping against their thighs,\r\nas when of old Greek bulls went adorned for sacrifice.\r\n\r\nSo the rulers departed, and again the feeble old guns did their\r\nutmost to voice the honours due to Imperial grandeur. Then the\r\nMaharajah returned to his sofa, and a sigh of relief appeared to\r\npass through the hall. I thought I could even hear it from behind\r\nthe carved shutters of the gallery, where ladies stood watching in\r\nseclusion, like the ladies behind the grill of our House of Commons.\r\nThe attendants again bore garlands, bouquets, and sprinklers into\r\nthe hall. The Maharajah was garlanded first, and then his son, the\r\nheir to the sofa, who received his honours with a superior smile\r\nthat told of Oxford’s contamination. The most peculiar part of the\r\nceremony came next, when silver plates were brought in, heaped high\r\nwith vermillion powder and with yellow, to represent the fertilizing\r\ndust of flowers in spring, and this dust was thrown in handfuls over\r\nthe Maharajah and his heir, and then over each Sirdar in turn.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the white chests of all those loyal counsellors blazed with\r\npatches of scarlet and gamboge, while pipes and drum pursued their\r\nown wild will, and the dancing-girl danced up seductively. Then\r\nthe Maharajah rose, and the whole assembly followed him from the\r\nhall. The climax had been reached, and the ceremony of spring was\r\nover, except that for the rest of the day the street boys rejoiced\r\nin “all the fun of the fair,” throwing red and yellow powder over\r\nthe passers-by. And if they mixed a little oil with the powder, the\r\npasser-by would recall the flowers that bloom in the spring whenever\r\nhe put those clothes on again.\r\n\r\nYou would suppose that such a ceremony was but the childish\r\nconsolation of some wretched prince, whom we allow to retain on\r\nsufferance the pomps and vanities of barbaric splendour, just as\r\nan idiot heir is allowed a rocking-horse and wooden sword by his\r\ntrustees. And that is partly true. It is in the spirit of interested\r\ntrustees for idiot children that the British Government gives the\r\nMaharajah that artillery to play with, and arms his handful of\r\ntroops with ancient muzzle-loaders that I had despaired of ever\r\nseeing in use. An ordinary and enfeebled ruler might thus solace\r\nhimself with pretty shows for a life of miserable impotence, just\r\nas Napoleon’s son played at soldiers in the Austrian palaces. Such\r\nis the end of most of those who are born to rule our Native States.\r\nFantastic palaces in every street, marble courts where fountains play\r\nall the summer, bedizened elephants in lordly rows, bejewelled girls\r\nbeyond the dreams of Solomon, studs of horses ceaselessly neighing,\r\nchanges of golden clothes for every hour of the day and night, heaps\r\nof golden coins piled high in treasuries, drink deep as wells,\r\nexquisite foods selected from Paris to Siam—oh, but to be weak is\r\nmiserable!\r\n\r\nBut the ruler of Baroda has the strength that conquers power out of\r\nweakness. Brought up among the temptations of princes, cheated with\r\nthe mockeries of authority, distrusted as seditious for the very\r\nexcellence of his reforms, he has raised his little State of some\r\ntwo million souls to become the most advanced and best administered\r\ndistrict of India, with the possible exception of Mysore. I know the\r\nworst that can be said against him. His land-tax is rather above the\r\naverage of British India, but at all events his entire income of just\r\nunder £1,000,000 a year is spent in the country itself, and does not\r\ngo to cherish the annuitants in Cheltenham or Whitehall. Like the\r\nEnglish aristocracy, he is fond of building more houses than one man\r\nneeds to live in. Like the late Lord Salisbury and Mr. Kruger, he\r\ndisplays an exaggerated solicitude in providing for members of his\r\nfamily, beyond the requirements of laudable thrift. And, worst fault\r\nof all, he has been sometimes suspected of imitating the Anglo-Indian\r\nauthorities in favouring Europeans at the cost of fully qualified\r\nIndians. On one occasion also, I believe, he conducted a punitive\r\nexpedition, on almost British lines, against some troublesome\r\nvillagers. I know all this is said, and much of it is very likely\r\ntrue, for even in a hovel it is difficult to live above reproach.\r\nBut I have also heard that in the foolish Durbar at Delhi, when\r\nother native rulers salaamed and prostrated themselves to earth, the\r\nMaharajah of Baroda went up to Lord Curzon like a man, and shook him\r\nheartily by the hand; and I think that story as likely to be true as\r\nthe others.\r\n\r\nIt is now over twenty-five years since he entered upon his power,\r\nafter a few years of tutelage under the British Government, which\r\nhad deposed his predecessor for overstepping the latitude granted to\r\nnative rulers in everything but politics. In that quarter-century,\r\nby the help of carefully chosen Ministers, such as Mr. Romesh\r\nChandra Dutt, he has realized reforms in government and daily life\r\nthat are continually called impossible by ourselves. Throughout\r\nhis whole State he has absolutely separated the judicial from the\r\nexecutive functions—a reform that we have acknowledged for years\r\nto be essential for India, but are boggling over still. He has\r\nrestored the ancient village Panchayat, or parish council, by the\r\nmen whom villagers can trust, whereas, in our passion for rigid and\r\ncentralized power, we have almost destroyed the last vestige of this\r\nnational training in self-government.\r\n\r\nAfter a careful experiment for fourteen years in one district, he\r\nhas now made primary education compulsory and universal throughout\r\nhis State. Whereas in British India the Government expenditure\r\nupon primary education still stood in 1906-7 at about £200,000, or\r\nconsiderably less than £1 per thousand of the population, in Baroda\r\nthe proportion was about £1 to every fifty-five, and the State counts\r\nmore educated girls, for its size, than any other part of India.\r\nThe latest step in constitutional reform has been the admission of\r\ngenuinely elected members into the Legislative Council, which was to\r\nmeet that year (1908) for the first time in its more democratic form.\r\nSuch reforms as the Indian Government had at that time proposed for\r\nits Legislative Council, were only intended to frustrate what shadow\r\nof democratic principle then existed in them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAKING YARN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A VILLAGE PANCHAYAT.]\r\n\r\nBut it is much harder to change a social custom than to legislate,\r\nand the Maharajah’s greatest triumphs lay in the prevention of\r\nchild-marriages, the emancipation of ladies from the “purdah,” or\r\ncurtained life, and the breaking-down of caste barriers. In all\r\nthis he had been aided by the encouragement and example of his\r\nMaharani, who had stood by his side like one of the heroic queens\r\nof Mahratta history. In all India I suppose there was not another\r\nman and woman who had done more for the happiness and advancement of\r\ntheir people, or done more to disprove the common Anglo-Indian charge\r\nthat Indians are incapable of carrying out even their own reforms.\r\nFor their very success they were suspected and maligned by officials,\r\nwho had not the courage to imitate their methods. But when official\r\ntorpor and private malignity had said their worst, the Maharajah and\r\nhis queen remained among the royal souls of India. They had once\r\nmore established the old Roman paradox that it is possible to follow\r\nvirtue even in a palace, and there was something almost Aurelian in\r\ntheir proud service to the Commonwealth.[71]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[71] For the development of Baroda, see the admirable series of\r\nannual Administration Reports prepared up to 1907 by Mr. Romesh C.\r\nDutt, C.I.E., Revenue Minister of Baroda, and since then by his\r\nsuccessor, Mr. Kersasp Rustamji.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nLet it be granted, as a matter of bare fact, quite apart from any\r\nwishes or opinions, that for many years to come we shall retain\r\nmilitary and administrative command in India. Rightly or wrongly, we\r\nshall retain it, unless we are so overwhelmingly defeated at home\r\nthat we almost cease to be not only an empire but a nation. Probably\r\nit is to our own advantage to retain it, because to withdraw before\r\nIndia is strong enough to stand alone would degrade our national life\r\nwith a cowardly sense of failure. Personally I think it is to India’s\r\nadvantage also, because her peoples are so unarmed, undrilled, and\r\nunorganized under our rule that if we withdrew our place would easily\r\nbe taken within a year by Russia, Germany, or Japan; perhaps by all\r\nthree in conflict. When the very worst that can be said against our\r\nrule has been said, the substitution of Russia’s rule for ours would\r\nbe an incalculable disaster from which India might recover only after\r\nmany generations, just as Poland, the Caucasus, and Persia may. Nor\r\nhave Germany and Japan yet given proof of governing subject races\r\nwith success, much less with humanity. Till India is sufficiently\r\nadvanced in arms, unity, and knowledge to hold her own (which used to\r\nbe the hope of our statesmen), it is probably to her advantage that\r\nwe should retain the ultimate supremacy in government and war. We may\r\nnot do it particularly well, but the chances are that others would do\r\nit incomparably worse. Let it be granted, anyhow, that nothing but\r\noverwhelming national defeat will deter us from doing it.\r\n\r\nBut whilst we shall continue, as far as politics can foresee, to\r\nsuperintend the administration of India and to protect her from\r\nexternal attack, the danger is that our bureaucracy, always the\r\nslowest form of government to realize change, should ignore the new\r\nspirit arising in the country, or should seek to stifle rather than\r\nguide it. It is the conviction of many that India is now standing on\r\nthe verge of a national renaissance—a new birth in intellect, social\r\nlife, and the affairs of state. There are unmistakable evidences of\r\nthis, not only among educated Hindus, but among educated Mohammedans;\r\nnot only among the educated classes, but throughout the masses of the\r\npeople. Many things have combined to create a new spirit, and we have\r\nourselves contributed much. The long peace that has made development\r\npossible, the easy communication by railways, the wide distribution\r\nof newspapers, the visits of highly educated Indians to England,\r\nthe use of English as a common tongue among educated people of all\r\nraces and religions, the increasing knowledge of our history and\r\nour hard-won liberties, the increasing study of our great Liberal\r\nthinkers—all these admirable advantages we have ourselves contributed\r\nto the new spirit, and it is useless for startled reactionaries to\r\nthink of withdrawing them now. We must also take into account the\r\nexample set to all Oriental nationalities by Japan, and the awakened\r\nstirring of Liberalism in England herself, and, no matter how feeble\r\nits efforts and how bitter its failure, in Russia, Egypt, Persia, and\r\nTurkey.\r\n\r\nMost of these beneficent influences move slowly, with a deep and\r\ngradual force, and, whatever happens, they will continue to move,\r\nthough to move slowly. But the outburst of the new spirit which we\r\ncall the unrest in India was occasioned by a different order of\r\nthings, for the most part, sudden, external, and pernicious. Such\r\nthings were the contemptuous disregard of Indian feeling in the\r\nPartition of Bengal and Lord Curzon’s University speech upon Indian\r\nmendacity; the exclusion of fully qualified Indians from public\r\npositions, in contradiction to Queen Victoria’s Proclamation of 1858;\r\nseveral notorious cases of injustice in the law courts, where English\r\ncriminals were involved; numerous instances of petty persecution\r\nfor political opinions since 1905; the well-known measures for\r\nthe suppression of personal liberty and freedom of speech in 1907\r\nand 1908; the espionage of police and postal officials; and the\r\nincreasing insolence of the vulgar among Anglo-Indians, as shown in\r\nordinary behaviour and in the newspapers which represent their views.\r\n\r\nAll these obvious and external causes of complaint, crowded into the\r\nspace of very few years, have been sapping India’s confidence in\r\nthe justice of our rule and the benevolence of our people. Indians\r\nhave, no doubt, exaggerated both the injustice and the malevolence.\r\nThey have taken a few flagrant cases of injustice as typical of our\r\nCourts; they have mistaken for malevolence what is only our reckless\r\nindifference to far-off responsibilities. But we cannot wonder at\r\ntheir mistakes. Nearly every one generalizes about foreign nations\r\nfrom the one or two specimens he knows; and we, as foreigners in\r\nIndia, must not hope to escape generalizations rapidly founded on\r\nthe behaviour of every man or woman who may represent us there\r\nunworthily. As to our national indifference, I wish we could say that\r\nthis charge also was founded only on special and notorious instances.\r\nBut it is not. Our indifference to the Indian peoples, from whom\r\nwe are continually sucking so much of our wealth, is universal and\r\ninvariable. Or it is varied only at long intervals after outbreaks of\r\nbloodshed and threatenings of revolt. No wonder that a growing party\r\nin India believes that only by such means can England’s attention be\r\nroused, and any permanent advantage for their country obtained.\r\n\r\nOf course, they are inconsiderate. In spite of the ill-manners of\r\na certain type of Anglo-Indian, we are as a whole rather a polite\r\nand kind-hearted people, and the mere shadow of injustice makes\r\nus seethe with indignation, so long as it is not too far away. If\r\nthey charge us with indifference, they ought to consider that we\r\nare faced with almost insoluble problems of our own; that we are a\r\nvery busy people, and that our knowledge of what goes on in India\r\nis generally limited to one or two speeches which attract little\r\nattention, a few Parliamentary questions, and the reports of official\r\nor other journalists whose very existence depends on standing\r\nwell with the Anglo-Indian community. Indians are too apt not to\r\nconsider these mitigating circumstances. But it does not tend to\r\nmake people considerate when men, women, and children are dying of a\r\ncomparatively recent plague by hundreds of thousands every year; when\r\nfor fifteen years in succession famines have been almost regularly\r\nrecurrent; when increasing malaria is rotting the population away in\r\nbody and mind, and when thousands, or probably millions, of people\r\nwho used to have two meals a day can now afford only one. I do not\r\nsay these disasters are the fault of the Indian Government or the\r\nBritish people. But it is obvious that they do not tend to make the\r\nsufferers under them considerate towards the difficulties of rulers\r\nwho hardly suffer from them at all. They are likely to be the less\r\nconsiderate because they know that, out of a revenue over which they\r\nhave no control, at least £20,000,000 a year is withdrawn from their\r\ncountry to be spent in England, partly in the shape of interest on\r\nserviceable loans, but largely in incomes, pensions, and other more\r\nquestionable forms; while, even against the better judgment of the\r\nhighest Anglo-Indian authorities themselves, the greatest Indian\r\nindustry is kept depressed by the countervailing excise of 3½ per\r\ncent. imposed by the Cotton Duties Act of 1896 on cottons made and\r\nsold in India, simply for the benefit of our Lancashire mills.\r\n\r\nConsiderate or not, the new spirit—the section of it that has time\r\nand youth on its side—has begun to despair of further appeals and\r\npetitions for English justice or assistance. In spite of the splendid\r\ntraditions of many noble Englishmen from Sir Thomas Munro down to\r\nLord Ripon, I suppose few representatives of our rule have been\r\npopular among the Indian races. That was not usually the fault of\r\nour representatives; their position made genuine popularity very\r\ndifficult, and it is impossible for one race to deny freedom to\r\nanother and rule it to the true advantage of either. But I think that\r\ntill lately the verdict of most Indians upon us would have been the\r\nsame as the schoolboy’s who called Dr. Temple “a beast, but a just\r\nbeast.” In their verdict to-day the compliment of that saving clause\r\nwould generally be omitted, and that loss of our high reputation for\r\njustice, if it is to be permanent, is the worst loss we could ever\r\nsuffer—worst for ourselves as patriots who honour our country for\r\nher justice, and worst for the Indians, whose position a sense of\r\npermanent injustice will render intolerable.\r\n\r\nThe belief that petitions for the redress of grievances, whether\r\npresented to the Indian Government or to the British people, are\r\nequally vain, is not so serious a matter for us as the distrust of\r\nour justice, but it contributed very strongly to the new spirit in\r\nits extreme form. Our disregard of all the public protests against\r\nthe Partition of Bengal and all the persistent appeals for its\r\nwithdrawal; our disregard of the reasonable pleading of such men as\r\nMr. Gokhale and Dr. Rash Behari Ghose in the Viceroy’s Council, have\r\nperhaps done more than anything else to discredit the methods of the\r\nold Congress. I do not mean that the Congress has been useless. It\r\nserved as a training ground for political knowledge. It afforded a\r\ncentre for the growing unity of India, and without it the leaders\r\nof Indian reform could hardly have formulated their own programme.\r\nBut in two avowed objects it has failed; it has had no influence\r\nupon the action of the Indian Government, and no influence upon\r\nEnglish opinion at home. For twenty-two years it was a model of order\r\nand constitutional propriety. It passed excellent resolutions, it\r\ndemanded the redress of acknowledged grievances, in trustful loyalty\r\nit arranged deputations to the representatives of the Crown. By the\r\nAnglo-Indians its constitutional propriety was called cowardice, its\r\nresolutions remained unnoticed, its grievances unredressed, and the\r\nrepresentative of the Crown refused to receive its deputation. In\r\nEngland, outside the half-dozen who take some interest in India, no\r\none knew where the Congress met, what language it spoke, what were\r\nits demands, or what its object; no one knew, and no one cared.\r\n\r\nThe new spirit perceived that it was useless addressing pious\r\nresolutions to the official waste-paper basket. The cry of\r\n“self-reliance, not mendicancy” spread through the country. One\r\nlast effort to attract British attention to the grievance of India\r\nwas made by the Swadeshi movement and the boycott on British goods.\r\n“Touch the pockets of our rulers, and they will listen”—that was the\r\nhope. And the hope was partly realized, for owing to Swadeshi and\r\nthe local disturbances in Eastern Bengal, Calcutta, and the Punjab,\r\nEngland during 1907 and 1908 has probably paid more attention to\r\nIndia than at any time since the Mutiny.\r\n\r\nBut the principle of Swadeshi has now been developed by the new\r\nspirit for purposes far beyond the immediate object proposed.\r\nSwadeshi in manufacture and commerce is now followed for the great\r\neconomic purpose of restoring the Indian industries, threatened or\r\nalready ruined by England’s favoured competition. And even this\r\neconomic Swadeshi is seen to be only a part of a much wider movement\r\nin self-reliance. On every side societies and orders are growing up\r\nfor the promotion of Indian ideals and the development of Indian\r\ncharacter, quite independently of our influence, and their members\r\nare sometimes inspired by an uncalculating devotion like that of\r\nthe early Christians. Such are the Arya Samaj in the Punjab and\r\nUnited Provinces; the Servants of India in Poona; the Brahmo Samaj\r\nof highly educated Theists in Calcutta; the Order of Ramakrishna\r\non the Ganges above Calcutta; the Hindu College in Benares, with\r\nwhich Mrs. Annie Besant’s name is so closely connected; the Order\r\nof the Gangrath Institute near Baroda; to say nothing of the\r\nwhole Volunteer movement, the object of which is the renewal of\r\norganization, courage, and physical power among the youth. None of\r\nthese movements is political in aim. Their work as societies lies in\r\nsocial and theological reform. But both in aim and method all are\r\ndistinctly Swadeshi. They take little account of Government or of\r\nthe Anglo-Indian community. In some of them there is even a tendency\r\nto react against reform, lest some taint of Western civilization\r\nshould be introduced into Indian life. But religious and social as\r\nthese movements are in origin and object, it is no longer possible\r\nto exclude their keener members from politics; for, among educated\r\npeople, the events of the last few years have given to national\r\npolitics the place once held by theology, and even social reform\r\ncannot now be entirely separated from political reform, since the\r\nresult of educational and other advance is inevitably an increased\r\ndemand for self-government.\r\n\r\nThe question immediately before India now is, which of two courses\r\nwith regard to ourselves the new spirit as a whole will take. On the\r\none hand, it may follow the line of most resistance. It may proclaim\r\nthroughout the whole country: “It is useless to trouble about any\r\nreforms that these intruding foreigners will give us. Let them go\r\non their way with their Advisory Councils, their Notables, their\r\nextended Legislative Councils, and other deceits. They have never\r\npaid the smallest attention to our real demands. In Mill’s words,\r\nthey keep us as a warren or preserve for their own use, a place to\r\nmake money in, a human farm to be worked for their own profit. It\r\nis for us to pursue our own course, disregarding their presence.\r\nBeyond paying their taxes, we need have little concern with them.\r\nIf they imprison us, we will go to gaol silently; if they deport us\r\nwithout trial, we will endure without protest; if they execute us,\r\nwe know that our souls will be at once re-incarnated to continue the\r\nstruggle. But we will not notice their Government either by sharing\r\nin it or denouncing it. In religion, in education, in industries and\r\ncommon life, we will follow our own national lines just as though no\r\nforeigners were pretending to rule us. If enough of us combine, we\r\nshall embarrass their position; perhaps we shall make it untenable\r\nas well as ridiculous. But whether it is untenable or not, we do not\r\ngreatly care, till a common Indian nationality has the strength to\r\ntake freedom into its own hands.”\r\n\r\nThat is the line of most resistance, always a tempting line to take,\r\nand many Indians are taking it now. The temptation must be almost\r\nirresistible in a vast population like India’s, where a handful of\r\npeople from a distant country maintain a predominance unmitigated\r\nby social intercourse, marriage, or permanent residence. All the\r\nmore because this predominance rests on so narrow a basis that for\r\nits own maintenance it is inclined to deter the subject race from\r\nall initiative, enterprise, or leadership, and so to reduce it to\r\nwhat Dadabhai Naoroji has described as “moral poverty.” Any movement\r\nto check this national deterioration must be welcomed on behalf of\r\nthe Indian peoples, except by those who openly desire those races\r\nto remain as flocks of sheep, dependent on the good nature or\r\ninterested bounty of their appointed shepherds. But that is not\r\nthe ideal that the best of our statesmen in India have set before\r\nthemselves, nor is it an ideal that can any longer be maintained. The\r\nnew spirit has already overthrown it.[72]\r\n\r\nBut besides this tempting line of most resistance there is another\r\nway, and, considering the external dangers that threaten India and\r\nher own existing difficulties of race, religion, and inexperience,\r\nthis other way is probably the way of wisdom. The new spirit may\r\nstill endeavour to act in harmony with us for the common good,\r\nacquiescing in our presence as on the whole tending to justice and\r\nadvancement, acknowledging the material advantages we have brought,\r\nbut at the same time persistently pressing for extensions of\r\nliberty, taking every opportunity that offers, and never hesitating\r\nto grasp at any chance of progress because it falls short of the\r\nperfect ideal. I admit that to follow this course requires a sweet\r\nreasonableness and a strength of character which few men in any\r\nnation possess. But after the defeats of many years, Mr. Gokhale\r\nstill retains his hope; and after the outrage upon his own freedom\r\nand the very basis of our liberties, Lajpat Rai still classes himself\r\nwith the Moderates. It depends almost entirely on ourselves whether\r\nthose who, in spite of recent disappointments, still believe in an\r\nEnglish feeling for justice and freedom shall be able to make their\r\nvoices heard. If only the more reasonable and hopeful party had\r\nsomething to point to—some generous and ungrudging act of justice on\r\nEngland’s part—they might still silence the counsels of despair. It\r\nis not yet too late. Only, it is no good juggling with sham reforms\r\nand half-hearted concessions. Our measures, as Burke said, must be\r\nremedial.\r\n\r\nThe nature of such measures is well known. They should include\r\na modification of the Partition of Bengal, by which the central\r\nprovince would be united under one Governor, having the same status\r\nas the Governors of Bombay and Madras, while the contiguous western\r\ndistricts were collected into a new province, and Assam remained\r\nisolated as it is by nature and race, under a Chief Commissioner\r\nresponsible either to the Viceroy or to the Governor of Bengal.[73]\r\nThey should include the appointment of at least one Indian on each\r\nof the Executive Councils (a concession which in the case of the\r\nViceroy’s Council seems likely to be fulfilled), and an enlargement\r\nof the Viceroy’s and other Legislative Councils by genuinely elected\r\nmembers up to the number of half the Council. This would leave to\r\nthe officials a steady but narrow majority, the right of absolute\r\nveto remaining with the Viceroy, Governor, or Lieutenant-Governor.\r\nIt might then be laid down that if a large proportion of the elected\r\nmembers—say, two-thirds—were opposed to a certain measure, it\r\nshould be suspended for further consideration. Some similar control\r\nshould be granted over the expenditure of money, for at present\r\nthe representative members have no voice in the revenue that is\r\nscraped off their people year by year, and the papers of protest\r\nor suggestion, which they read as they sit round the Viceroy’s\r\ncouncil-table, might almost as well remain unread for any effect they\r\nhave upon the official policy.\r\n\r\nThese reforms could be followed by a gradual extension of primary\r\neducation, which might in the end cost us £5,000,000 a year, but\r\nwould be well worth the price, even if we had to save something off\r\nthe £20,000,000 now spent on the Army, and something off the other\r\npublic services. Owing to our present parsimony in education, the\r\ncensus of 1901 reported that there were 104,500,000 males in India\r\nwho could not read, 826 boys out of every 1000 of school age who had\r\nno school to go to, and only 1 in 10 males literate, and 7 in 1000\r\nfemales. Further, we could be loyal to the late Queen’s Proclamation\r\nand admit Indians without prejudice to the positions they had fitted\r\nthemselves for. We could make the position of the police such that\r\nthey would be no longer compelled to help out their livelihood by\r\ncorruption and false evidence. We could resolutely extinguish the\r\nsystem of Begar or forced labour for the benefit of Civilians and\r\nother Europeans. And we could make it illegal for any representative\r\nof our Government to condescend to the baseness of opening other\r\npeople’s letters, even on the off-chance of spying upon sedition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A DESERTED CITY.\r\n\r\n  _[Face p. 334._\r\n]\r\n\r\nSuch measures as these would be remedial. They would serve as an\r\nearnest of our country’s goodwill, and of our determination to\r\nmaintain the principles of freedom and justice in our government.\r\nThey would cut the ground under the feet of those who, by proclaiming\r\nperpetual distrust of our intentions, are fostering a fanatical\r\nhatred against us. But I am aware that measures by themselves are\r\ninsufficient. What is wanted is the difficult thing that our fathers\r\ncalled a “change of heart,” and no legislation can effect that. We\r\nneed a change that would transform our people’s arrogance towards\r\n“natives”; a change that would prevent the ladies and gentlemen whom\r\nwe send out from degenerating into “bounders” where Indians are\r\nconcerned, and would make it impossible for an Englishman to display\r\ntowards Indians the outrageous manners that would exclude him from\r\ndecent society at home. Such a change must be extremely difficult\r\namong ourselves of the upper and middle classes, for we are not\r\nborn very imaginative or sympathetic, we are educated on a plane\r\nof patronizing superiority, and outside our class and nation any\r\nclaim to equality staggers us like a sudden blow. But there are one\r\nor two quite simple points on which we might begin to practise for\r\nthe change. Except among the baser sort of Anglo-Indians, the word\r\n“nigger” has died out, and I would suggest that the word “native”\r\nmight follow it. If the phrase “rulers and ruled” died too, and\r\nif our social philosophers would cease to drone out their weary\r\nineptitude that “East is East, and West is West,” the situation would\r\nbe much eased. I have sometimes thought also that our reputation\r\nwould stand higher if English people who insist, quite rightly, on\r\nthe importance of our prestige, were to abstain now and then, for the\r\nsake of our prestige, from games that develop neither courage nor\r\nstrength, and are regarded by Indians with contemptuous astonishment,\r\nand from a mode of dancing which is regarded by Indians as an\r\nindescribable abomination.\r\n\r\nBut the present crisis is too acute to allow of waiting for a change\r\nof heart. Upon our immediate action will depend the terms under\r\nwhich we must maintain our position in India: whether we are to hold\r\nthe new spirit fairly on our side, and to cooperate with it for\r\nthe progress of the country in enlightenment and self-government;\r\nor whether we are to have our rule confronted by impenetrable\r\nresentment, and our best efforts thwarted by indifference or\r\nsuspicion. In any case, India has a long and bitter road to travel.\r\nThe gulf between her educated and uneducated classes is wider\r\neven than in our own country. She has many divisions of thought,\r\nand caste, and race to overcome. But, as to the growth of her new\r\nspirit, we need have no fear. It is one of the most hopeful signs\r\nof our hopeful time. Every act of injustice on our part, and every\r\nattempt at political suppression, have only promoted India’s sense of\r\nunity and hastened her progress in self-reliance. If injustice and\r\nsuppression continue, their effect will be the same. Whatever course\r\nour action may now take, the new spirit has already breathed a fresh\r\nlife into large classes of the Indian peoples, and it will continue\r\nto afford a high motive for self-devotion, and for the moral courage\r\nand love of freedom in which the Indian character has hitherto been\r\nlacking. For India herself the present unrest holds out a promise\r\nof the highest possibilities, no matter how much she may suffer in\r\nrealizing them.\r\n\r\nBut for us the brief interval left for decision is momentous. On our\r\ndecision it will depend whether, in contempt of the freedom we have\r\nwith such obstinate labour secured for ourselves, we shall sink, step\r\nby step, from suppression into persecution, and from persecution\r\ninto atrocities that now we should shudder at; or whether we\r\nshall display strength enough to welcome the spirit of freedom and\r\nnationality which we have done so much to create, and strength enough\r\nto advance with it hand-in-hand for the furtherance of India’s\r\nwelfare as a self-respecting country, and so to redeem our reputation\r\nfor the love of a freedom which others may enjoy, as we enjoy it.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[72] This subject of “moral poverty” was treated in a paper Prof.\r\nC. F. Andrews of St. Stephen’s College, Delhi, read before the\r\nPan-Anglican Congress in London (1908), and published in “The Indian\r\nReview” for June. The success of Prof. Rudra, a Bengali economist and\r\nhistorian, as Principal of that College, with a staff that includes\r\nFirst Class Cambridge men, one of them a Fellow of his College, is\r\none of the many disproofs of the theory that Indians are incapable of\r\ninitiative and leadership. Even Mohammedan men of learning are glad\r\nto serve under him gratuitously.\r\n\r\n[73] See Introduction, p. 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abkari, excise, 121\r\n\r\n  Act, Land Alienation, 2;\r\n    Official Secrets, 4;\r\n    Universities, 4\r\n\r\n  Adamson, Sir Harvey, 119-171\r\n\r\n  Afghanistan, agreement with Russia about, 24\r\n\r\n  Agnew, Mr., Deputy Commissioner, 18\r\n\r\n  Agra, land question in, 83;\r\n    effect of rain at, 279\r\n\r\n  Agreement with China and Russia about Afghanistan, Lhassa, and\r\n        Persia, 24\r\n\r\n  Agricultural banks, 89\r\n\r\n  Ahmedabad (Congress, 1902), 215\r\n\r\n  Ajit Singh, founds “Indian Patriots,” 18;\r\n    speaks at Lyallpur, 18;\r\n    deported, 19, 304;\r\n    released, 126\r\n\r\n  Akbar, inheritors of, 189;\r\n    land of, 236\r\n\r\n  Aligarh, college at, 199, 321\r\n\r\n  Allahabad, press of, 230\r\n\r\n  Allen, Mr., Collector of Dacca, shot, 238;\r\n    regrets for assault, 254\r\n\r\n  _Amrita Bazar Patrika_, M.
