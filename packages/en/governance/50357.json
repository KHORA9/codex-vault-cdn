Smith, Jr.\r\n\r\nSalt Lake City\r\n\r\n1909\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1906 and continuing until the summer of 1907,\r\na number of Reorganite ministers who were engaged in missionary\r\nwork in Salt Lake City and Ogden, were greatly encouraged by one or\r\ntwo apostates and the local anti-\"Mormon\" press. Their method of\r\nproselyting was of the usual nature, a tirade of abuse and false\r\naccusation hurled at the authorities of the Church. Encouraged\r\nby the anti-\"Mormon\" help, they became extremely vindictive in\r\ntheir references to President Brigham Young and the present Church\r\nauthorities. Their sermons were so bitter and malignant--which has been\r\nthe character of most of their work from the beginning, in Utah--that\r\nthey raised considerable protest from many respectable citizens. Even\r\nnon-\"Mormons\" declared that in no other community would such vicious\r\nattacks be tolerated. It appeared at times that these missionaries were\r\nattempting to provoke the \"Mormon\" people to some act of violence,\r\nthat it might be seized upon and published to the world through the\r\nanti-\"Mormon\" press that they had been mobbed, and thus capital for\r\ntheir cause be made of it. Fortunately they were not molested to the\r\ncredit of the people so constantly abused. One of these meetings was\r\nattended by a prominent gentleman from the East who was somewhat\r\nacquainted with Utah and her people, he said, in conversation with the\r\nwriter a few days later, that never in his experience has he witnessed\r\nsuch a thing before. \"If that fellow\"--referring to a Reorganite who\r\nhas since been promoted in his church--\"should come to our town and\r\nabuse the ministers of our church, calling them murderers, thieves and\r\nliars, as he did Brigham Young and your churchmen, we would kick him\r\noff the streets.\"\r\n\r\nWhile this agitation was going on, a number of the young people of\r\nOgden appealed to their stake presidency asking that some reply to\r\nthose assaults be made for the benefit of those who were not grounded\r\nin the faith, and in danger of being deceived. Acting on this request\r\nthe presidency of the Weber Stake invited the writer to speak along\r\nthese lines in the Ogden Tabernacle. The invitation was accepted and\r\ntwo discourses were delivered, the first, March 10, 1907, on the\r\nsubject of the \"Origin of the Reorganized Church,\" and the other\r\nApril 28, 1907, on the question of \"Succession.\" These remarks were\r\nsubsequently published in the _Deseret News_, and many requests were\r\nreceived asking that they be published in pamphlet form, where they\r\ncould be preserved by those who had to meet the ministers of the\r\n\"Reorganization.\" An edition was therefore published in the summer\r\nof 1907, which has been disposed of, evidently without supplying the\r\ndemand, for in the summer of 1909 the orders for the pamphlet were so\r\ngreat that is was deemed necessary to issue a second edition. In the\r\nmeantime a reply appeared in the Saints' Herald, commencing with the\r\nissue of June 30, and ending that of July 21, 1909. This reply will be\r\nremembered more for the unfair way matters were treated and the fact\r\nthat the greater part of the evidence was left untouched, than for any\r\nmerit in the argument presented. Wherever it was deemed necessary, for\r\nthe sake of those who may be deceived, answers are given in this work\r\nin footnote references to the argument set forth in the Reorganite\r\n\"defense.\" However, there was nothing presented in the \"defense\"\r\nthat really required any reply; by reading carefully the discourses\r\nmentioned, the ordinary reader can readily perceive the trickery,\r\ndeception and sophistry, of the Reorganite reply.\r\n\r\nPart one of this book contains the discourse delivered in Ogden on\r\nthe \"Origin of the 'Reorganized' Church;\" part two contains the\r\ndiscourse on the \"Succession in the Presidency,\" and part three deals\r\nwith the most prominent differences existing between the Church and\r\nthe \"Reorganization,\" wherein they accuse us of departing from the\r\ndoctrines of the Prophet Joseph Smith. This matter in part three is\r\nadded by request of a number of parties who have had to meet the\r\nsophistry of the Reorganite missionaries.\r\n\r\nThis book is not put forth to replace any other work, neither with the\r\nidea that it will turn Reorganite ministers from the folly of their\r\nways; but with the hope that some honest soul who have been deceived\r\nmay see the light and embrace the truth, and that the feet of the\r\nweak may be strengthened in the path of righteousness that they may\r\nnot falter on their way. Neither is it intended to be an exhaustive\r\ntreatise in of the subjects it contains; the idea has been in the main,\r\nto present matters that have not been treated elsewhere.--J. F. S., Jr.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF THE \"REORGANIZED\" CHURCH.\r\n\r\nThe Question of Rejection--Salvation for the Dead\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nRemarks made in the Weber Stake Tabernacle, Ogden City, March 10, 1907,\r\nby Elder Joseph F. Smith, Jr.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nMy beloved brethren and sisters and friends: The great majority of\r\nyou who are assembled here today are, without doubt, members of the\r\nChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and I suppose that most of\r\nyou have a divine testimony of the truth of this latter-day work--the\r\nGospel of Christ--which we have received. To you who have a testimony,\r\nmy remarks shall not be addressed particularly, but if you will bear\r\nwith me in what I have to say that I may be led to say something that\r\nwill strengthen the faith of those who may be weak, or that will\r\nencourage those who have no faith at all, I will feel amply paid.\r\n\r\nI am not here for the purpose of assailing any man for his religion,\r\nfor we Latter-day Saints hold that every man is entitled to his\r\nreligious views and should have the privilege of worshiping according\r\nto the dictates of his conscience, let him worship, how, where, or what\r\nhe may. And we will protect him in this right. But we are opposed to\r\nthe custom adopted by certain men who travel through the settlements\r\nof our people abusing the authorities of the Church, distorting our\r\ndoctrines and defaming the dead, for the purpose of destroying the\r\nfaith and confidence of the Latter-day Saints. Therefore in treating\r\nthe subject of the \"Reorganized\" Church this afternoon, it will be in\r\nthe spirit of self-defense.\r\n\r\nWe will first consider the statement made by the senior senator from\r\nMichigan, Mr. Burrows, in his speech delivered in the United States\r\nSenate on the 11th of last December. After stating that the membership\r\nof the Church at the martyrdom in 1844, was 50,000 adherents, he\r\ncontinues:\r\n\r\n    \"The death of Joseph Smith in 1844, carried dismay and\r\n    demoralization throughout the entire membership of the Mormon\r\n    Church, scattering its adherents in divers directions and for the\r\n    time being seemed to presage the complete overthrow and dissolution\r\n    of the organization. Recovering, however, from the shock, the\r\n    scattered bands soon reappeared in various parts of the country\r\n    and promulgated their doctrines with increased zeal, and set to\r\n    work to reassemble and reorganize their scattered forces, resulting\r\n    finally in the formation of what is now known and recognized as\r\n    the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, with\r\n    headquarters at Lamoni, Iowa, and presided over by Joseph Smith, a\r\n    son of the prophet.\"\r\n\r\nHe continues:\r\n\r\n    \"During this period of disintegration one Brigham Young, who\r\n    had identified himself with the 'Mormon Organization' as early\r\n    as 1832, a man of indomitable will and undaunted courage, bold\r\n    and unscrupulous, seized upon the occasion of the demoralization\r\n    incident to the death of the prophet to place himself at the head\r\n    of some 5,000 Mormons, and marching over desert and mountain,\r\n    established himself with his adherents in the valley of Salt\r\n    Lake, July 24, 1847, then Mexican territory, where he undoubtedly\r\n    indulged the hope that the new doctrine of polygamy about to be\r\n    publicly proclaimed by him might be promulgated with impunity\r\n    and practiced and maintained without interference by the United\r\n    States.\"[1]\r\n\r\nNow, this is not true. The senior senator from Michigan has here stated\r\nthe position of the \"Reorganized\" Church as capably and clearly as any\r\nmember of that sect could possibly have done, and in exactly the same\r\nway that they have stated it for the past forty-seven years. Why he was\r\nled to make such a statement he best may know, but it shows the careful\r\ncoaching that he has received by members of the \"Reorganized\" Church in\r\ntheir opposition to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\r\n\r\nIn a pamphlet published by that organization in 1864, the following\r\nappears:\r\n\r\n    \"The greater portion of the Church did not follow this Brigham\r\n    Young, and in obedience to the revelation in relation to gathering,\r\n    remained around about the land of Zion, waiting for the Lord to\r\n    again reveal Himself; and today where there is one Saint who was in\r\n    the Church in the days of Joseph the martyr, now associated with\r\n    Brigham Young, there are ten of those old members standing aloof or\r\n    rejoicing under the administration of the word of the Lord through\r\n    his son Joseph.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSAINTS FOLLOWED PRESIDENT YOUNG.\r\n\r\nAnd this is not true. Now I intend to show that at the martyrdom the\r\nLatter-day Saints followed President Brigham Young and the Twelve. And\r\ntoo, in accordance with divine revelation. For we learn in the Doctrine\r\nand Covenants that the quorum of Apostles is equal in authority with\r\nthe First Presidency and it is their right to take the lead of Church\r\naffairs and the presidency in the absence of the First Presidency, or\r\nwhen that quorum is invaded by the death of the President of the Church.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the martyrdom the Church in and about Nauvoo, the\r\nheadquarters, numbered not to exceed 20,000 souls. This information is\r\nbased on the best possible authority. And while this was not all the\r\nChurch membership in the United States, it was the great bulk of the\r\nSaints, as the following will show:\r\n\r\nIn the Times and Seasons, volume 2, page 274, in a \"Proclamation to the\r\nSaints scattered abroad,\" and signed by the Presidency Joseph Smith,\r\nSidney Rigdon, and Hyrum Smith, dated January 15, 1841, we read the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n    \"The population of our city is increasing with unparalleled\r\n    rapidity, numbering more than 3,000 inhabitants. Every facility\r\n    is offered in the city and adjacent country, in Hancock county,\r\n    for the successful prosecution of the mechanical arts, and the\r\n    pleasing pursuits of agriculture. The waters of the Mississippi\r\n    can be successfully used for manufacturing purposes, to an almost\r\n    unlimited extent.\r\n\r\n    \"Having been instrumental in the hands of our Heavenly Father\r\n    in laying a foundation for the gathering of Zion, we would say,\r\n    let all those who appreciate the blessings of the Gospel, and\r\n    realize the importance of obeying the commandments of heaven, who\r\n    have been blessed of heaven with the possession of this world's\r\n    goods, first prepare for the general gathering, let them dispose\r\n    of their effects as fast as circumstances will possibly admit,\r\n    without making too great sacrifice, and remove to our city and\r\n    county--establish and build up manufactories in the city, purchase\r\n    and cultivate farms in the county--this will secure our permanent\r\n    inheritance, and prepare the way for the gathering of the poor.\r\n    This is agreeable to the order of heaven, and the only principle on\r\n    which the gathering can be effected--let the rich, then, and all\r\n    who can assist in establishing this place, make every preparation\r\n    to come on without delay, and strengthen our hands, and assist in\r\n    promoting the happiness of the Saints. This cannot be too forcibly\r\n    impressed on the minds of all, and the elders are hereby instructed\r\n    to proclaim this word in all places where the Saints reside,\r\n    in their public administrations, for this is according to the\r\n    instructions we have received from the Lord.\"\r\n\r\nNow, this shows that the Saints \"scattered abroad\" were commanded of\r\nthe Lord to gather at Nauvoo and in Hancock county, Illinois. It will\r\ngo without saying that all the faithful Latter-day Saints would take\r\nadvantage of this commandment and therefore the faithful Saints, or\r\nthe great majority of them would soon be located at Nauvoo. Again in\r\nthis same volume, page 434, we find another proclamation to the Saints\r\nabroad, signed by President Joseph Smith, in which he says:\r\n\r\n    \"The First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\r\n    Saints, anxious to promote the prosperity of said Church, feel it\r\n    their duty to call upon the Saints who reside out of this county\r\n    to make preparations to come in, without delay. This is important\r\n    and should be attended to by all who feel an interest in the\r\n    prosperity of this the corner stone of Zion. Here the Temple must\r\n    be raised, the university be built, and other edifices erected\r\n    which are necessary for the great work of the last days; and which\r\n    can only be done by a concentration of energy and enterprise. Let\r\n    it therefore be understood, that all the stakes, excepting those\r\n    in this county and in Lee county, Iowa, are discontinued, and the\r\n    Saints instructed to settle in this county as soon as circumstances\r\n    will permit.\"\r\n\r\nThis was on May 24, 1841, and we find in the same volume, page 520, an\r\nepistle from the Twelve to the \"Saints scattered abroad,\" in which the\r\nfollowing is found:\r\n\r\n    \"We say to all Saints who desire to do the will of heaven, arise,\r\n    and tarry not, but come up hither to the places of gathering as\r\n    speedily as possible, for the time is rapidly approaching when\r\n    the Saints will have occasion to regret that they have so long\r\n    neglected to assemble themselves together and stand in holy places\r\n    awaiting those tremendous events which are so rapidly approaching\r\n    the nations of the earth.\r\n\r\n    \"It will be recollected that in a recent communication from the\r\n    First Presidency, all places of gathering are discontinued,\r\n    excepting Hancock county, Ill., and Zarahemla in Lee county, I. T.,\r\n    opposite Nauvoo.\"\r\n\r\nAt the conference of the Church held in October, 1841, Almon W. Babbitt\r\nwas disfellowshipped for persuading Saints who were emigrating to\r\nNauvoo to remain and build up Kirtland, Ohio, as the minutes say,\r\n\"until such time as he shall make satisfaction.\" This shows how\r\nimportant this doctrine of gathering was. Therefore the great bulk of\r\nthe Latter-day Saints, at the time of the martyrdom, were located at\r\nNauvoo and its vicinity.\r\n\r\nIt is in order now to show that these Latter-day Saints sustained\r\nPresident Brigham Young and the Twelve.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th day of August, following the martyrdom, a special conference\r\nwas held in Nauvoo at which time the claims of Sidney Rigdon and the\r\nrightful claim of the Twelve Apostles were presented for the vote\r\nof the Latter-day Saints. At this conference President Young, in\r\naddressing the Saints said:\r\n\r\n    \"I will ask you as quorums, Do you want Brother Rigdon to stand\r\n    forward as your leader, your guide, your spokesman? President\r\n    Rigdon wants me to bring up the other question first, and that is,\r\n    Does the Church want, and is it their only desire to sustain the\r\n    Twelve as the First Presidency of this people? * * * * All that are\r\n    in favor of this, in all the congregation of the Saints manifest\r\n    it by holding up the right hand. (There was a universal vote.) If\r\n    there are any of the contrary mind, every man and every woman who\r\n    does not want the Twelve to preside, lift up your hands in like\r\n    manner, (no hands up.) This supersedes the other question, and\r\n    trying it by quorums.\" (History of the Church, Aug. 8, 1844.)\r\n\r\nAlso at the general conference held the following October the Apostles\r\nwere again unanimously sustained by the vote of the Church as the\r\npresiding quorum and Presidency of the Church. (Times and Seasons,\r\n5:692). Mark you this was by the unanimous vote of the Saints.[2]\r\n\r\nNow, in the exodus from Nauvoo these Saints--the great bulk of the\r\nChurch, continued to be true and faithful and followed the Twelve\r\nApostles.\r\n\r\nGovernor Thomas Ford, in his \"History of Illinois,\" states that in 1846\r\nthere were 16,000 Church members with the Twelve on the plains of Iowa,\r\nwhile the 1,000 that remained, a small remnant, were those who were\r\nunable to sell their property, or who having no property to sell, were\r\nunable to get away. (History of \"Reorganized\" Church iii:164). And this\r\nremnant followed as soon as they were able.\r\n\r\nIn the census report for 1850--three years after the settlement of\r\nSalt Lake valley, we learn that the population of Utah was 11,380, all\r\nMormons. That same year the population of Pottawattomie county, Iowa,\r\nwas 7,828, all Mormons, the Latter-day Saints at Kanesville. Thus\r\nwe see that 19,208 members of the Church who had followed President\r\nBrigham Young in the exodus from Nauvoo, were located at these two\r\nplaces. And that is not all, there were other settlements of the\r\nSaints at Garden Grove, Mount Pisgah, St. Louis, and other places\r\nwhere temporary settlements for the Saints were formed during that\r\nexodus. These also later gathered to Utah. Thus we see that almost\r\nthe entire membership of the Church as it stood in 1844, is accounted\r\nfor in the following of President Brigham Young and the Twelve.\r\nThat the Church was not threatened with dissolution the following\r\nstatistics will show--I have not at hand the increase of membership of\r\nthe Church during that period in the United States, but the increase\r\nin Great Britain is as follows: In the year 1844, the population\r\nof the Church in the British Isles was 7,797. Six years after the\r\nmartyrdom--December, 1850--that membership had increased to 30,747.\r\nThis does not show much of a dissolution or falling away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHO FORSOOK THE CHURCH?\r\n\r\nI do not intend to convey the idea that there was not a falling away,\r\nan apostasy, at the time of the martyrdom and the exodus from Nauvoo,\r\nfor there were many who forsook the cause, but compared with the Church\r\nmembership, they were but few. Who were they? Did the faithful Saints\r\nforsake the Church at that time? Did those who risked their lives--who\r\nwere shot with the Prophet and Patriarch forsake the Church? No! We do\r\nnot find the faithful Latter-day Saints, who had the Gospel rooted in\r\ntheir hearts turning away. Then who were those who forsook the cause? I\r\nwill tell you.\r\n\r\nIn the parable of the sower the Savior said:\r\n\r\n    \"Behold a sower went forth to sow; and when he sowed some seed fell\r\n    by the wayside, and the fowls came and devoured them up. Some fell\r\n    upon stony places where they had not much earth; and forthwith they\r\n    sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth; and when the sun\r\n    was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they\r\n    withered away.\"\r\n\r\nIn explaining this parable He said:\r\n\r\n    \"But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he\r\n    that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it; yet hath he\r\n    not root in himself, but dureth for a while; for when tribulation\r\n    or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is\r\n    offended.\"\r\n\r\nThese were they who forsook the Church in the exodus from Nauvoo. Not\r\nthe faithful who had been tried and proved and not found wanting, who\r\nhad an abiding testimony of the truth. Now, let us see what Gen. Thomas\r\nL. Kane has to say on this subject. He visited Nauvoo about this time\r\nand also the camps of Israel. In the postscript to the second edition\r\nof his lecture on \"The Mormons\" he says, page 86:\r\n\r\n    \"The Mormons as I saw them, though a majority, were but a portion\r\n    of the Church as it flourished in Illinois. When the persecution\r\n    triumphed there, and no alternative remained for the steadfast in\r\n    the faith but the flight out of Egypt into the wilderness, as it\r\n    was termed, all their fair weather friends forsook them.\" * * * * *\r\n\r\n    \"So the Mormons have been as it were, broken and screened by\r\n    calamity. Their designing leaders have left them to seek after\r\n    fortunes elsewhere. Those that remain of the old stock are the\r\n    masses, always honest in the main and sincere even in delusion; and\r\n    their guides are a few tried and trusty men, little initiated in\r\n    the plotting of synagogues, and more noted for services rendered\r\n    than bounties received. They are the men whom I saw on the prairie\r\n    trail, sharing sorrow with the sorrowful, and poverty with the\r\n    poor; the chief of them all, a man of rare natural endowment, to\r\n    whose masterly guidance they are mainly indebted for their present\r\n    prosperity, driving his own ox team and carrying his sick child in\r\n    his arms.\"\r\n\r\nWe have the statement of Sidney Rigdon, one of those who forsook the\r\ncause. It is found in his Messenger and Advocate for June, 1846, pages\r\n474-5, and a portion of his statement I will now read:\r\n\r\n    \"Their camp [that is the camp of the exiles, the pioneers] is in\r\n    the western part of Iowa, some 200 miles west of Nauvoo. Their\r\n    situation according to our informant, is as miserable as it well\r\n    could be. Their stock of provisions they took with them, is getting\r\n    fast reduced, so much so, that they can proceed no further; neither\r\n    can they go back. They are there without shelter, other than tents\r\n    and wagons, and their tents so indifferent that they will not shed\r\n    the rain, which has been incessantly falling since their arrival.\r\n    In this awful condition is to be found the aged and infirm, the\r\n    mother and tender infant. When our informant left, they were\r\n    going to fence in some 300 or 400 acres of land, for the purpose\r\n    of raising a crop of corn to try and preserve life. The remains\r\n    of their furniture, which in part consists of beds and bedding,\r\n    they are sending off to Missouri to exchange for corn and bacon to\r\n    sustain life. * * * * This said Young professed to be a follower\r\n    of Christ, and hold communion with Him, and to receive revelations\r\n    from Him; but where are his pretensions now? He has got, according\r\n    to our informant, some 800 or 1,000 people far into the wilds,\r\n    without food, without shelter, and himself being judge, without\r\n    object. * * * A state of wretchedness beyond this is not easily\r\n    conceived of. Our informant says when he left, which was some three\r\n    weeks since [and I may add that it is quite evident from this\r\n    account why he left] the mud, by reason of the incessant rains, was\r\n    six inches deep round their camp.\"\r\n\r\nI suppose that there are some present this afternoon who realize the\r\nhardships through which the pioneers had to pass that tried men's souls\r\nand that only the faithful were able to endure.\r\n\r\nI have now shown that the great majority of the Latter-day Saints\r\nfollowed President Brigham Young and were true to the Church. We get a\r\ngood idea of the number who scattered from the testimony of William W.\r\nBlair.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEW JOINED REORGANITES.\r\n\r\nOf the members of the Church who were in fellowship in 1844-6, the\r\n\"Reorganized\" Church has received no more, and likely less than 1,000\r\nconverts, which fact shows that the apostasy was not so great in 1844-6\r\nas has been stated by the Senator from Michigan and members of the\r\n\"Reorganization.\" This statement is based on the testimony of William\r\nW. Blair, one of the original members of the \"Reorganized\" Church, as\r\nhe testified before the United States court of appeals for the Western\r\ndistrict of Missouri, in 1894, in the temple lot suit, which was for\r\nthe possession of property in the hands of the \"Church of Christ,\" or\r\n\"Hedrickites.\"\r\n\r\nBefore that court Mr. Blair, who was for many years a member of the\r\npresidency of the \"Reorganized\" Church, testified that \"1,000 was\r\nprobably too high an estimate for the members of the original Church,\r\nthat had joined the 'Reorganized' Church.\" He could \"approximately\r\nsay,\" that 1,000 had joined the \"Reorganized\" Church, and \"possibly\r\nthat estimate was too large.\" (Record pp. 180, 181).\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF \"REORGANIZED\" CHURCH.\r\n\r\nWe will now consider the origin of this \"Reorganized\" Church. Many\r\npeople have been lead to believe that this society had its origin at\r\nthe martyrdom, or immediately following the martyrdom. But this is not\r\nthe fact. Properly it did not come into existence until 1860--16 years\r\nafter the martyrdom, but the two men who were mainly responsible for\r\nthe organization commenced their work in 1852-3. These men were Jason\r\nW. Briggs and Zenas H. Gurley. Perhaps a brief outline of their lives\r\nwould be interesting.\r\n\r\nJason W. Briggs who was really the founder of the \"Reorganized\" Church,\r\nor, who perhaps did more than any other one man to bring about that\r\nsect, was born June 25, 1821, at Pompey, Onondaga county, N. Y. It is\r\nsaid he joined the Church at Potosi, Wis., about 1841, but most of the\r\nhistory of this man we get through the records of the \"reorganization.\"\r\nHis home was at Beloit, Wis., from 1842 to 1854.[3] He remained with\r\nthe Church under the leadership of President Young and the Twelve until\r\nthe year 1846 (Reorg. Hist., 3:737). It is interesting to note in this\r\nregard that the exodus commenced February 4, 1846, so we are quite safe\r\nin saying that this man was one of \"the fair weather friends.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the exodus he joined James J. Strang, and in his organization\r\nlabored in the ministry quite extensively (Reorganite History 3; 737),\r\nfilling short missions to various parts of New York and in Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nIn September of 1849, with B. G. Wright, he organized the Waukesha\r\nbranch of Mr. Strang's church (Hist. Reorganized Church, 3; 737-8).\r\nNow, remember this was in September, 1849, and the organization of\r\nthis branch was in the Strangite church. About this same time he also\r\norganized the Beloit branch for the same organization.[4]\r\n\r\nIn 1850 he left Mr. Strang's organization and joined with William\r\nSmith, who had himself been a follower of Mr. Strang until\r\nexcommunicated from that organization. In William Smith's church Mr.\r\nBriggs accepted the position of \"apostle;\" but at the time of the\r\ndisintegration of William Smith's church in 1851, he withdrew, and in\r\n1852 joined with Zenas H. Gurley. These two men then organized what\r\nwas called at the time the \"New Organization of the Church,\" but today\r\nknown as the \"Reorganized\" Church.\r\n\r\nIn 1886, together with the family of Zenas H. Gurley,[5] Mr. Briggs\r\nwithdrew from the \"Reorganization,\" which he had begotten. (Saints'\r\nHerald, 33; 248-9). His reasons for withdrawing we will consider later.\r\n\r\nZenas H. Gurley was more active in the Church previous to the\r\nmartyrdom. He was ordained a Seventy in Nauvoo in 1844, and when the\r\nTwenty-first quorum of Seventy was organized, April 6, 1845, he was\r\nchosen as the senior president, he being the oldest of the presidents\r\nchosen. He was a native of New York state, born May 29, 1801, and was\r\ntherefore 43 years of age in 1844.\r\n\r\nWe know something about this man's career between the martyrdom and the\r\nexodus from the minutes of this quorum of Seventy. And as this record\r\ncontains some very interesting items I will read a few of them here. In\r\nthe minutes of November 2, 1845, we read:\r\n\r\n    \"President Zenas H. Gurley apologized for his absence the two last\r\n    meetings. He then enlarged upon the subject (i. e., the subject\r\n    before the quorum). He said he had received the assurance of\r\n    an addition of power of the Priesthood upon every accession of\r\n    authority he had received. We ought to be the best men living in\r\n    consideration of our privileges as members of the Church of Jesus\r\n    Christ of Latter-day Saints, enlightened as it was with divine\r\n    revelation, He exhorted the brethren not to aspire but to rise upon\r\n    their own merits and to visit the poor in their afflictions.\"\r\n\r\nIn the minutes of November 9, we are informed that President Erastus H.\r\nDerby, one of the presidents of that quorum, said:\r\n\r\n    \"Brother Brigham advised and counseled the Saints to get ready for\r\n    emigration in May, 1846. If he (Derby) possessed the wealth of the\r\n    whole nation he would not stay behind the Church going into the\r\n    wilderness.\"\r\n\r\nImmediately following these remarks, Zenas H. Gurley arose and said, as\r\nthe minutes read, that \"He confirmed the same.\" That is, he too would\r\nrather forsake the wealth of the whole nation than fail to go with the\r\nChurch into the wilderness. Then continuing his remarks, he said:\r\n\r\n    \"Small prototypes of great national events were given by command\r\n    of God, by the ancient prophets, and the like would probably\r\n    nowadays distinguish what God is about to do in the earth. * * *\r\n    Certain characters have been elected from before time to fulfill\r\n    certain purposes in the earth, called though they were from all\r\n    nations, tongues, and ranks. * * * The order of free masonry was\r\n    outrageously violated by the people of Hancock; but the pledges,\r\n    obligations and vows of the Latter-day Saints would, if adhered to,\r\n    exalt them to thrones dominions and power.\"\r\n\r\nThis was in relation to temple work. On the 21st of December, 1845, he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n    \"He remembered forcibly the sayings of the first presidents of\r\n    Seventy, that we should so live that no charge can be brought\r\n    against us. A few years ago the men in high standing in this\r\n    Church (the Twelve) were as little as we are. They obtained their\r\n    exaltation by patient submission to right, and minding their own\r\n    business. * * * There are many young men in this quorum able to\r\n    travel a great way. You will be called on to go, also to receive\r\n    your endowment. Keep always meek and a teachable spirit. The willow\r\n    always bends in the breeze and is also firm in the root. Though\r\n    many have gone out from the Church.\"--now remember this--\"YET\r\n    it increases as fast as ever and evinces to the world as great\r\n    affinity and identity to the eternal plan of Jehovah as ever it\r\n    did.\"\r\n\r\nThis does not sound much like a falling away or a dissolution of the\r\nChurch, does it? And this is the testimony of Zenas H. Gurley given\r\nbefore he left the Church. Again, on the 3rd of January, 1846, the\r\nminutes say:\r\n\r\n    \"Zenas H. Gurley enlarged on the subject of liberally donating\r\n    to the Church necessities. God said He has so shaped the scheme\r\n    of salvation as that to be saved and appear approved of God, we\r\n    must sacrifice of all that we possess. * * He felt filled with the\r\n    Spirit. The course the Church is pursuing has been spoken of by\r\n    Jesus Christ and the holy prophets of olden time.\"\r\n\r\nThere is his endorsement of the course of the Church. And on January\r\n10, 1846:\r\n\r\n    \"Zenas H. Gurley arose and said that the presidents of the quorum\r\n    had received their endowment.\"\r\n\r\nContinuing he said--mark you, he was one of those presidents:\r\n\r\n    \"He observed that it was remarkable for an unusual outpouring of\r\n    the Holy Spirit. He felt for the quorum that they should receive\r\n    their endowment. The Church authorities, the quorum of Seventy in\r\n    succession, to furnish the people engaged in the endowment, one day\r\n    each, and he wanted the quorum (Twenty-first) to acquit themselves\r\n    from every obligation.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be interesting to know that this man and his wife were endowed\r\nin the Temple January 6, 1846. Here is the testimony of Zenas H. Gurley\r\nin relation to the Temple ceremonies when he was in full fellowship in\r\nthe Church and was in possession of the spirit of his calling. At that\r\ntime he declared most emphatically that on that occasion the Spirit of\r\nthe Lord was unusual in its outpouring. If that is true and he could\r\ntestify to it then, there cannot be anything so very bad in these\r\nglorious privileges of which he testified. In later years when he had\r\nlost the spirit of the Gospel and was fighting the work he had formerly\r\nupheld, he denounced in bitterness these sacred ordinances that he\r\non this occasion sanctioned. His former testimony is the one that is\r\nconsistent.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of January, 1846, the minutes say:\r\n\r\n    \"President Zenas H. Gurley arose and said * * The business before\r\n    the meeting was the arranging for a donation for the benefit of\r\n    those of the Priesthood engaged in the Temple. (Not on the Temple\r\n    but in it). He beautifully observed that it was his design, and\r\n    also his council's to exalt the Twenty-first quorum, and the quorum\r\n    should reciprocally return the favor; give support and influence\r\n    towards its welfare.\"\r\n\r\nThen on the 25th of the same month:\r\n\r\n    \"President Zenas H. Gurley arose and said that the business before\r\n    the meeting was to select persons to receive their endowment. He\r\n    had received direction to select 10 or 12 to go in the Temple. He\r\n    desired the brethren not to think it was partiality to make this\r\n    selection. The most important point to be considered was to learn\r\n    obedience. This was the principle taught by Jesus Christ.\"\r\n\r\nHe then proceeded to name the brethren for this purpose, and continuing\r\nhis remarks he said:\r\n\r\n    \"The Saints who have passed through the trials of the Church were\r\n    generally rooted and grounded in love and have a witness in their\r\n    hearts or they would not have remained.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I say amen to that. I wish with all my soul that Zenas H. Gurley\r\nhad been one of them for his own sake, for it was but 10 days after he\r\nmade this utterance, that the exodus from Nauvoo began, and this is\r\nthe last reference we have of Zenas H. Gurley while connected with the\r\nChurch! What became of him? \"Because he had no root he withered away.\"\r\nThe terrible trials the Saints were forced to undergo in the wilderness\r\nwere too great for him; he could not stand the test. And while he had\r\ndeclared that he would go with the Saints even if it required that he\r\nshould sacrifice the wealth of the whole nation, when put to the actual\r\ntest, his heart failed him and he sought safety in flight, he sought\r\nhis life, but lost the life eternal!\r\n\r\nThe next reference we have of him in the minutes of the Twenty-first\r\nquorum is in 1855, where the statement is made that he had fled from\r\nthe Church and was associated with James J. Strang. Of his connection\r\nwith Mr. Strang, I prefer to read to you the account from the history\r\nof the \"Reorganized\" Church, for you know then we will have it correct.\r\nOn page 744 of volume three we have the following:\r\n\r\n    \"After the death of Joseph Smith, Elder Gurley investigated the\r\n    claims of the various leaders, and finally accepted those of James\r\n    J. Strang as being the most reasonable. A letter written by him\r\n    from Gananoque, Canada West, November 6, 1849, and published in\r\n    Gospel Herald, volume 4, page 187, indicates that he was then on a\r\n    mission to Canada in the interest of the organization under Strang.\r\n    On January 1, 1850, he again wrote from Landsdown, Upper Canada,\r\n    still engaged in the same work.\r\n\r\n    \"A letter written January 10, 1850, from Pittsburg, Canada West,\r\n    manifested zeal in his work.\"\r\n\r\nWe have already shown how he manifested great zeal in his work in the\r\nTwenty-first quorum before he left the Church. But to continue:\r\n\r\n    \"March 15, 1850 he wrote from St. Lawrence, New York, that he was\r\n    assisting Brother Silsby in organizing the brethren and helping\r\n    them in getting ready for Beaver. He was present at a conference\r\n    held at Voree, Wisconsin, June 1 and 2, 1850, and in these minutes\r\n    we find this entry: 'Brother Z. H. Gurley was'--\r\n\r\nThen there is an ellipsis, no doubt it would be interesting to know what\r\nfollows, and the account continues--\r\n\r\n    'sent to the northeastern parts of Wisconsin, on the presentation\r\n    of President Strang.'\"\r\n\r\nNow, please note carefully what follows:\r\n\r\n    \"It was probably while on the mission thus appointed that Elder\r\n    Gurley raised up the Yellowstone branch, the members of which\r\n    helped to form the nucleus of the Reorganization.\"--Page 744-5.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that Jason W. Briggs raised up the Waukesha branch\r\nof the Strangite church in 1849, also that he raised up the Beloit\r\nbranch for the same organization, and now we have the admission fatal\r\nto their organization, that the Yellowstone branch was also raised\r\nup to Mr. James J. Strang. These branches you see became the nucleus\r\nof the \"Reorganization.\" They were not connected with the Church of\r\nJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, according to their own admission,\r\nbut were organized for the Church of James J. Strang. Yet, mark you,\r\nthese Strangite branches were admitted into what was called the \"New\r\norganization,\" or the \"Reorganization,\" on their original baptisms.[6]\r\nIt is quite evident that the \"Reorganization\" is the offspring of the\r\nchurch of this man James J. Strang.\r\n\r\nNow let us return to Jason W. Briggs. In Mr. Heman C. Smith's \"True\r\nSuccession,\" pages 134-135, we have an alleged revelation that\r\nthis man received that was the cause of the coming together of the\r\nso-called \"Reorganized\" Church. I have already told you that he was\r\nthe most important man in this movement, if not the father of it. The\r\n\"revelation\" is as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"Therefore, let the elders whom I have ordained by the hand of my\r\n    servant Joseph, or by the hand of those ordained by him, resist not\r\n    this authority, nor faint in the discharge of duty, which is to\r\n    preach my gospel as revealed in the records of the Jews, and the\r\n    Book of Mormon, and the Book of Doctrine and Covenants; and cry\r\n    repentance and remission of sins through obedience to the gospel,\r\n    and I will sustain them, and give them my Spirit; and in mine own\r\n    due time will I call upon the seed of Joseph Smith, and will bring\r\n    one forth, and he shall be mighty and strong, and he shall preside\r\n    over the High Priesthood of my Church; and then shall the quorums\r\n    assemble, and the pure in heart shall gather, and Zion shall be\r\n    reinhabited, as I said unto my servant Joseph Smith.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY BRIGGS SECEDED.\r\n\r\nIn this alleged revelation we have this man teaching lineal Priesthood\r\nor the right of succession from father to son. We also have him\r\nteaching the literal gathering to Zion of the honest in heart. We will\r\nnow see what his reasons were for withdrawing from the \"Reorganized\"\r\nChurch. We find on pages 248-249 of volume 33 of the Saints' Herald\r\nthat the reasons why this man withdrew from the \"Reorganization\" with\r\nthe family of Zenas H. Gurley, were as follows:\r\n\r\nThat he could not believe in:\r\n\r\n(1) \"The literal gathering of the Church into Jackson and the adjoining\r\ncounties in the state of Missouri (or any one or more places) known as\r\na local Zion.\"\r\n\r\n(2) \"Temple building and ceremonial endowments therein.\"\r\n\r\n(3) \"Baptism for the dead.\"\r\n\r\n(4) \"Tithing as a law applicable to the Church.\"\r\n\r\n(5) \"The law of consecration by which individuals are made legal heirs\r\nto the Kingdom of Zion.\"\r\n\r\n(6) \"A sole mouthpiece of God to the Church.\"\r\n\r\n(7) \"The plenary inspiration of and consequent absolute authority of\r\nwhat are called the sacred books.\"\r\n\r\n(8) \"The doctrine of 'cursing our enemies,' and of 'avenging God upon\r\nthem to the third and fourth generations.'\"\r\n\r\n(9) \"To the foregoing may be added the revelation of January 19, 1841,\r\nsection 107 D. & C., (124 our edition), which enjoins upon the Church\r\nthe building of a hotel, called the 'Lord's boarding-house,' for Joseph\r\nSmith and posterity to dwell in from generation to generation, as\r\nalso the promise contained therein, viz: 'And as I said unto Abraham\r\nconcerning the kindreds of the earth, even so I say to my servant\r\nJoseph, in thee and thy seed shall the kindreds of the earth be\r\nblessed.\"\r\n\r\n\"This coupled with the provisions in section 43, that 'none else should\r\nor could receive revelation for the Church' and the provision of\r\nsection 19, that the Church shall receive Joseph's words and commands\r\nthe same as if from God's own mouth,--establish in our judgment a\r\nlineal descent of authority, equivalent to an imperial dynasty, which\r\nis foreign to the spirit and genius of the Gospel of Christ.\"\r\n\r\nThis communication was dated March 28, 1886, and was signed by Jason\r\nW. Briggs, (president of their apostles); Zenas H. Gurley, (a member\r\nof that quorum); Gracie Gurley, Margaret Gurley, Edwin H. Gurley, Mida\r\nGurley.\r\n\r\nWe see that this Mr. Briggs repudiated the fundamental portions of\r\nhis alleged revelation. In the \"revelation\" he teaches the gathering,\r\nbut here he says he does not believe in the gathering, either to\r\nJackson county or to any other place to be known as a local Zion. In\r\nhis \"revelation\" he teaches lineal Priesthood, but when he withdraws\r\nfrom the church one reason was that he could not believe in \"a sole\r\nmouth-piece of God to the Church,\" and in an \"imperial dynasty,\" which\r\nhe erroneously thought was taught in the revelation. Thus he repudiates\r\nhis \"revelation,\" denies the divine mission of the Prophet Joseph\r\nSmith, and repudiates the standard works of the Church.[7] Unstable to\r\nthe last, this man would not rest content in this organization which he\r\nwas such a potent instrument in bringing into existence.[8]\r\n\r\nThere is another thing in his so-called \"revelation\" that is\r\ninteresting. He declares that the Lord would raise up one of the seed\r\nof Joseph Smith who would be mighty and strong. Now, evidently this\r\nrefers to Joseph Smith, president of that organization. Joseph Smith\r\nof the \"Reorganized\" Church declares that he is not the one mighty and\r\nstrong and the \"Reorganized\" Church has backed him up by resolution in\r\nthat conclusion.[9]\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTION OF REJECTION.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the question of the rejection of the Church. Our friends\r\ntell us that the Church was rejected for the reason that they failed\r\nto complete the Nauvoo Temple \"in the sufficient time granted by the\r\nLord.\" They say that the Temple was not finished. The president of the\r\n\"Reorganization\" has made the following statement in this connection:\r\n\r\n    \"The basement was fitted for occupation and the baptismal font was\r\n    ready for use. The auditorium on the first floor was completed\r\n    sufficiently to be seated and occupied for assembly purposes. The\r\n    stairway on the south side was completed for use. The auditorium\r\n    on the second floor, the stairway on the north side, nor any other\r\n    portion of the building except those above named were completed;\r\n    though the small rooms above the second floor auditorium were used\r\n    by President Young and the resident Church authorities for various\r\n    purposes.\" (History of Reorganized Church, 2:562).\r\n\r\nHis brother Alexander makes a similar statement.\r\n\r\nIn reply to this it is only necessary to say that it made no difference\r\nwhether the Temple was finished or not. The revelation of January 19,\r\n1841, provided,\r\n\r\n    \"That when I (the Lord) give a commandment to any of the sons of\r\n    men, to do a work unto my name, and those sons of men go with all\r\n    their might, and with all they have, to perform that work, and\r\n    cease not their diligence, and their enemies come upon them, and\r\n    hinder them from performing that work; behold, it behooveth me to\r\n    require that work no more at the hands of those sons of men, but to\r\n    accept of their offerings:\r\n\r\n    \"And the iniquity and transgression of my holy laws and\r\n    commandments, I will visit upon the heads of those who hindered my\r\n    work, unto the third and fourth generation, so long as they repent\r\n    not, and hate me, saith the Lord God.\r\n\r\n    \"Therefore for this cause have I accepted the offerings of those\r\n    whom I commanded to build up a city and a house unto my name, in\r\n    Jackson county, Missouri, and were hindered by their enemies, saith\r\n    the Lord your God:\r\n\r\n    \"And I will answer judgment, wrath, and indignation, wailing and\r\n    anguish and gnashing of teeth upon their heads, unto the third and\r\n    fourth generation, so long as they repent not and hate me, saith\r\n    the Lord your God.\r\n\r\n    \"And this I make an example unto you for your consolation\r\n    concerning all those who have been commanded to do a work, and have\r\n    been hindered by the hands of their enemies, and by oppression\r\n    saith the Lord your God.\"[10]\r\n\r\nNo sane man will dare say that the Saints were not hindered by their\r\nenemies in the building of the Nauvoo Temple, both before and after the\r\nmartyrdom. Nevertheless, I maintain that they were diligent in their\r\nlabors as the following references will show, furthermore that the\r\nTemple was completed. In the Times and Seasons, volume 3, page 775, is\r\nto be found an editorial written by the Prophet Joseph in which he says:\r\n\r\n    \"This noble edifice is progressing with great rapidity; strenuous\r\n    exertions are being made on every hand to facilitate its erection;\r\n    and materials of all kinds are in great state of forwardness. * * *\r\n    *\r\n\r\n    \"While the busy multitudes have thus been engaged in their several\r\n    avocations, performing their daily labor, and working one-tenth of\r\n    their time, others have not been less forward in bringing in their\r\n    tithings and consecrations for the same great object. Never since\r\n    the formation of this Church was laid have we seen manifested a\r\n    greater willingness to comply with the requisitions of Jehovah; a\r\n    more ardent desire to do the will of God; more strenuous exertions\r\n    used, or greater sacrifices made, then there have been since the\r\n    Lord said: Let the Temple be built by the tithing of my people.\r\n    It seemed as though the spirit of enterprise, philanthropy, and\r\n    obedience rested simultaneously upon old and young; and brethren\r\n    and sisters, boys and girls, and even strangers, who were not\r\n    in the Church, united with an unprecedented liberality in the\r\n    accomplishment of this great work; nor could the widow in many\r\n    instances, be prevented, out of her scanty pittance, from throwing\r\n    in her two mites.\"\r\n\r\nThis was written in May, 1842. Remember the date, for I will have\r\noccasion to refer to this again before we are through.\r\n\r\nThis editorial reveals to us what is meant by laboring with your\r\nmight and \"to cease not their diligence.\" The Lord did not require\r\nall the time of the Saints to be devoted on that building, but a\r\ntithing--one-tenth of their time or means. That is all He required of\r\nthem in order that they should fulfill the commandment. This is also\r\nset forth in the second vol. of the Times and Seasons, page 567, and in\r\nvol., 3 pages 938-9, but I take it for granted that the reference given\r\nis sufficient to cover this ground.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEMPLE BUILT BY SACRIFICE.\r\n\r\nLet us here pause a moment and see what it took to build the Temple.\r\nThat structure cost more than one million dollars; the Saints were\r\npoor, and a great deal of the time the Temple was in course of erection\r\nthey were harassed by their enemies. The Prophet Joseph was forced\r\ninto exile to avoid his enemies who tried to drag him to Missouri, and\r\ntherefore he could not devote his personal attention to the building of\r\nthe Temple as he otherwise would have done; and in this way the work\r\nwas retarded to some degree by the enemies of the people. Moreover,\r\nthe building of that structure was not like building one today. The\r\nSaints could not order their timber from the lumber yard in a state of\r\npreparation for the Temple. There were no iron foundries from which\r\nthey could obtain the required metal properly prepared; but on the\r\ncontrary, every detail had to be performed by the Saints. The timber\r\nhad to be hewed in the far off forests of Wisconsin, carried to Nauvoo,\r\nand cut into boards and for the various uses of the Temple. The stone\r\nhad to be cut and polished from the quarries, and the whole work had to\r\nbe supplied out of the tithing of the people. If the Lord had required\r\nall of their time how would they have supported their families? Of\r\ncourse, He could have cared for them, but it was but the tenth, mark\r\nyou, of their time and means that was required. And yet some of our\r\nfriends complain that the Temple was not completed inside of six\r\nmonths! Naturally under these conditions it would take a number of\r\nyears to complete the building.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the Saints were diligent up to May, 1842.[11] Let us\r\nnow see if they did not continue their diligence. Of course, there were\r\nsome who were not diligent; but not of the faithful, not of those who\r\nfollowed the Twelve. At the April conference, 1844, the Patriarch Hyrum\r\nSmith, addressing the Saints, said:\r\n\r\n    \"I am one of the committee (i. e., Temple committee); the committee\r\n    tell me the quarry is blockaded, it is filled with rock, the stone\r\n    cutters are wanting work; come on with your teams as soon as\r\n    conference is over. It is not necessary for me to tell who will\r\n    come and do it; I will prophesy that you will do it. There is not\r\n    one in the city but that will do right if they know it, only one or\r\n    two exceptions, and they are not worth notice; God will take care\r\n    of them, and if He doesn't, the devil will.\" (T. & S., 5:597).\r\n\r\nNow, I know that Hyrum Smith was a prophet of God, the Lord declared\r\nit, and his prophecy did not fail. This shows the willingness of the\r\nSaints to do this work as late as 1844.\r\n\r\nIn a communication to the Times and Seasons, October 13, 1844, signed\r\n\"C,\" we have the following:\r\n\r\n    \"The Temple is rising even faster than could have been anticipated,\r\n    and has a very imposing appearance.\"\r\n\r\nAgain on page 744, of volume 5, Times and Seasons, (December 15, 1844),\r\nthis is stated:\r\n\r\n    \"The Temple has progressed with greater rapidity since the death of\r\n    Joseph and Hyrum than ever it had done before; and things in this\r\n    city never looked more prosperous.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in an editorial in this same paper of May 15, 1845:\r\n\r\n    \"The Temple progresses rapidly and the Saints being united (as we\r\n    have heretofore said), are industrious, frugal and determined.\"\r\n\r\nThen in the Times and Seasons, volume 6, page 926:\r\n\r\n    \"After a little more than four years of hard labor, in truly\r\n    troublesome times, and not, too, without the loss of the best blood\r\n    in the Church, on the morning of the 24th ult. (April, 1845), at a\r\n    little past 6, a goodly number of Saints had the honor, and glory\r\n    to witness the capstone of the Temple laid in its place.\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter from Elder John Taylor to Joseph Cain (Mill. Star, 8:31),\r\nwe find this:\r\n\r\n    \"My feelings were very peculiar while standing in the font, which\r\n    is of stone, and passing through the rooms when I thought how the\r\n    Saints had labored and striven to complete the building.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in the Times and Seasons, volume 6, page 1017:\r\n\r\n    \"On Sunday, the 5th of October (1845) through the indefatigable\r\n    exertions, unceasing industry, and heaven blessed labors, in the\r\n    midst of trials, tribulations, poverty, and worldly obstacles,\r\n    solemnized, in some instances, by death, about 5,000 Saints had the\r\n    inexpressible joy and great gratification to meet for the first\r\n    time in the house of the Lord in the city of Joseph (Nauvoo). From\r\n    mites and tithing, millions had risen up to the glory of God, as a\r\n    Temple where the children of the last kingdom, could come together\r\n    and praise the Lord.\"\r\n\r\nThere are other passages; but these ought to suffice on this point of\r\nthe diligence of the Saints. But some one will say, all this testimony\r\nis from those who are interested--from your friends. Should we take the\r\ntestimony of our enemies, those who are interested in our downfall,\r\nand who are not acquainted with these facts? However, I will add the\r\ntestimony of one who hoped that the Temple would not be finished. In\r\nthe Messenger and Advocate of June, 1846, published by Sidney Rigdon, I\r\nquote the following:\r\n\r\n    \"That people [the Saints with Brigham Young] were told that they\r\n    would not finish that Temple which THEY were building. They were\r\n    told that they would get the roof on, and do some of the inside\r\n    work, but never would finish it.\"\r\n\r\nNow mark this; he adds:\r\n\r\n    \"No people ever labored harder to prove the above declaration\r\n    false. No pains were spared; but where has it terminated? Just as\r\n    we said it would.\"\r\n\r\nHere we have the testimony of Sidney Rigdon, who opposed the Twelve\r\nand the Church and the building of that Temple. Yet he says they were\r\ndiligent, but when he says it was not completed, he spoke too soon.\r\nThis article was written just shortly after the exodus commenced, and\r\nat that time the Temple was not quite finished; but it was finished\r\nbefore all the Saints' left Nauvoo.\r\n\r\nI suppose that it is unnecessary to continue this branch of the subject\r\nany further, but since our Church members have to meet the sophistry on\r\nthe part of the elders of the \"Reorganization,\" we will.\r\n\r\n\r\nNAUVOO TEMPLE COMPLETED.\r\n\r\nIn proof that the Temple was completed I present the following\r\nevidence. In the Times and Seasons, volume 6, page 1017, we find the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n    \"It certainly afforded a holy satisfaction to think that since\r\n    the 6th of April, 1841, when the first stone was laid, amidst\r\n    the most straightened circumstances, the Church of Jesus Christ\r\n    of Latter-day Saints has witnessed their bread cast upon waters;\r\n    or more properly their obedience to the commandments of the Lord\r\n    appear in the tangible form of a Temple, entirely enclosed, windows\r\n    in, with temporary floors, pulpits, and seats to accommodate so\r\n    many persons preparatory to a general conference.\"\r\n\r\nAnd on page 1018:\r\n\r\n    \"The font and the other parts of the Temple will be in readiness\r\n    in a few days to commence the administration of holy ordinances of\r\n    endowment, for which the faithful have long diligently labored and\r\n    fervently prayed, desiring above all things to see the beauty of\r\n    the Lord and inquire in His holy Temple.\"\r\n\r\nNow, this was given in October, 1845, and we learn that the font--that\r\nis the permanent font, which replaced the former and temporary\r\none--also the other parts of the Temple would be in readiness in a few\r\ndays to commence the administration of holy ordinances. I wish now\r\nto refer to another reference from the writings of the president of\r\nthe \"Reorganization.\" I have already read where he declares that the\r\nfont and the first floor above the basement and one stairway, also the\r\nbasement, were completed. He reaffirms that in the following from an\r\neditorial in the Saints' Herald of February 17, 1904:\r\n\r\n    \"Work continued to be done on the Temple until the fall of 1845,\r\n    possibly until the summer of 1846\"--you see he is not quite sure\r\n    about it--\"but the building was never finished; and whatever\r\n    ordinances were performed in it took place in rooms not wholly\r\n    finished.\"\r\n\r\nNow note this particularly:\r\n\r\n    \"The north stairway, the second or upper auditorium, and the attic\r\n    were entirely incompleted.\"\r\n\r\nWe will now examine the Times and Seasons of January 20, 1846, and see\r\nwhat his testimony is worth. Here on page 1096 occurs the following:\r\n\r\n    \"January thus far has been mild, which, in the midst of our\r\n    preparations for an exodus next spring, has given an excellent time\r\n    to finish the Temple. Nothing has appeared so much like a finish of\r\n    that holy edifice as the present.\"\r\n\r\nNow, I want to call your attention to this which immediately follows:\r\n\r\n    \"The ATTIC story was finished in December.\"\r\n\r\nThat is in December 1845. You will remember that the president of the\r\nReorganization declares that the attic was \"entirely incompleted.\" But\r\nto continue the quotation:\r\n\r\n    \"And if the Lord continues to favor us, the first story above the\r\n    basement will be completed ready for meeting, in the month of\r\n    February. The font, standing upon 12 stone oxen, is about ready,\r\n    and the floor of the story is laid, so that all speculation about\r\n    the Temple of God at Nauvoo, must cease.\"\r\n\r\nNow the temporary floors were laid in October, 1845, so these floors\r\nmust have been the permanent ones, and while the temporary finishing in\r\nOctober was for the purpose of fitting the building for the ordinances,\r\nthis finishing was permanent.\r\n\r\nHere is an interesting feature about the testimony of this man. The\r\nparts of the Temple which the president of the \"Reorganized\" Church\r\nsays were completed--finished, the Times and Seasons here states would\r\nnot be finished for a few days, or till February, but the part of the\r\nbuilding which he says was \"entirely incompleted,\" is here declared\r\nto have been finished in the past December, 1845. I shall not dispute\r\nwith him the fact that the parts which he says were finished, were\r\ncompleted, for they were; but what does his testimony amount to as\r\nevidence when confronted with the statement of the Times and Seasons?\r\nSimply nothing; more than to prove that he knew nothing about it at\r\nall. Now which shall we believe? The Times and Seasons, published\r\nat the time, or the president of the \"Reorganization,\" who made his\r\nstatement some 40 years later? Remember if he admits that the Temple\r\nwas finished his whole structure crumbles to the ground--it's bound to\r\ncrumble anyway sooner or later, for it is built upon the sand.\r\n\r\nElder John Taylor, in an address to the Saints in England, published in\r\nthe Millennial Star of November, 1846, (vol. 8:97) has this to say:\r\n\r\n    \"Time alone can unfold this to many, but to us it has been\r\n    manifested long ago, years before the Temple WAS COMPLETED, and\r\n    long before the martyrdom of our Prophet and Patriarch.\"\r\n\r\nHere he declares that the Temple was completed. Now our friends quote\r\nfrom the remarks of President Brigham Young delivered at the dedication\r\nof the St. George Temple to the effect that up to that time the Saints\r\nhad never had the privilege of completing and enjoying a Temple. I call\r\nyour attention to the fact that President Brigham Young left Nauvoo\r\nbefore the Temple was finished. He left in February, 1846, and a great\r\nportion of the Latter-day Saints were expelled from that city before\r\nthey had the privilege of receiving the ordinances of the house of God,\r\ntherefore President Young was correct when he said we had not up to\r\nthat time had the privilege of completing and enjoying one. But I will\r\nnow call your attention to the statement of President Young's made in\r\nOctober, 1863, (News, 13:96). Said he,\r\n\r\n    \"We have already built two Temples, one at Kirtland, Ohio, and one\r\n    at Nauvoo, Illinois. * * * God commanded us to build the Nauvoo\r\n    Temple, and we built it, and performed our duty pretty well. There\r\n    are elders present here today who labored on that house with not a\r\n    shoe to their foot, or pantaloons that would cover their limbs, or a\r\n    shirt to cover their arms.\r\n\r\n    \"We performed the work, and performed it WITHIN THE TIME WHICH\r\n    THE LORD GAVE US TO DO IT IN. Apostates said that we never could\r\n    perform that work, but through the blessing of God it was completed\r\n    and accepted of Him. Apostates never build Temples unto God, but\r\n    the Saints are called to do this work.\"\r\n\r\nThe Nauvoo Temple was publicly dedicated May 1, 1846, by Elder Orson\r\nHyde, and the following day about 3,000 Saints met in the building in\r\na public service. It is most likely that the greater number of these\r\nSaints were also at the dedication. It is not reasonable to suppose\r\nthat this building was dedicated until it was finished, for each part\r\nhad been dedicated as it was finished, and the dedication on the 1st of\r\nMay, 1846, was of the entire structure.[12]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REVELATION ON TEMPLE WORK.\r\n\r\nI have now shown that the Temple was completed; that the Saints\r\nwere diligent in their labors, and they were also hindered by their\r\nenemies. I now reaffirm what has previously been said; that it made no\r\ndifference, so far as the Church and its authority is concerned, even\r\nif the Temple had not been completed, or finished, in the technical\r\nsense of that word. Some of the embellishments, the ornamentations and\r\nfixtures, may not have been placed in the building according to the\r\noriginal intention, and in that technical sense the building may not\r\nhave been \"finished completely.\" But if so, what difference would it\r\nmake? The Lord, thank heaven, is not as technical and peevish as men\r\nare, or woe be unto all of us. The revelation does not say that the\r\nChurch would be rejected with its dead if every identical board and\r\nplank or fixture was not in the building according to the original\r\ndesign. The thing the revelation does require is that a place be\r\nprepared, or built, where the Lord could reveal the Priesthood and its\r\nordinances which had been taken away or that had not been restored.\r\nAnd, too, if the temporary floors had not been replaced by the\r\npermanent floors, the Lord could and would have revealed Himself to the\r\nSaints and would have accepted of their offering. Now let's see just\r\nwhat the revelation does say about this matter. Beginning at verse 25.\r\n\r\n    \"25. And again, verily I say unto you, let all my Saints come from\r\n    afar;\r\n\r\n    26. And send ye swift messengers, yea, chosen messengers, and say\r\n    unto them; come ye, with all your gold, and your silver, and your\r\n    precious stones, and with all your antiquities; and with all who\r\n    have knowledge of antiquities, that will come, may come, and bring\r\n    the box tree, and the fir tree, and the pine tree, together with\r\n    all the precious trees of the earth;\r\n\r\n    27. And with iron, with copper, and with brass, and with zinc, and\r\n    with all your precious things of the earth, and build a house to my\r\n    name, for the most High to dwell therein;\r\n\r\n    28. For there is not a place found on earth that he may come and\r\n    restore again that which was lost unto you, or which he hath taken\r\n    away, even the fulnesss of the Priesthood;\r\n\r\n    29. For a baptismal font there is not upon the earth, that they, my\r\n    Saints, may be baptized for those who are dead;\r\n\r\n    30. For this ordinance belongeth to my house, and cannot be\r\n    acceptable to me, only in the days of your poverty, wherein ye are\r\n    not able to build a house unto me.\r\n\r\n    31. But I command you, all ye my Saints, to build a house unto me;\r\n    and I grant unto you a sufficient time to build a house unto me,\r\n    and during this time your baptisms shall be acceptable unto me.\r\n\r\n    32. But behold, at the end of this appointment, your baptisms for\r\n    your dead shall not be acceptable unto me; and if you do not these\r\n    things at the end of the appointment, ye shall be rejected as a\r\n    church, with your dead, saith the Lord your God.\r\n\r\n    33. For verily I say unto you, that after you have had sufficient\r\n    time to build a house to me, wherein the ordinance of baptizing\r\n    for the dead belongeth, and for which the same was instituted from\r\n    before the foundation of the world, your baptisms for your dead\r\n    cannot be acceptable unto me.\r\n\r\n    34. For therein (that is in Temples) are the keys of the Holy\r\n    Priesthood ordained that you may receive honor and glory.\r\n\r\n    35. And after this time, your baptisms for the dead, by those who\r\n    are scattered abroad, are not acceptable unto me, saith the Lord.\r\n\r\n    36. For it is ordained that in Zion, and in her stakes, and in\r\n    Jerusalem, those places which I have appointed for refuge, shall be\r\n    the places for your baptisms for your dead.\r\n\r\n    37. And again, verily I say unto you, How shall your washings be\r\n    acceptable unto me, except ye perform them in a house which you\r\n    have built to my name?\r\n\r\n    38. For, for this cause I commanded Moses that he should build a\r\n    tabernacle, that they should bear it with them in the wilderness,\r\n    and to build a house in the land of promise that those ordinances\r\n    might be revealed which had been hid from before the world was;\r\n\r\n    39. Therefore, verily I say unto you, that your anointings and\r\n    your washings, and your baptisms for the dead, and your solemn\r\n    assemblies, and your memorials for your sacrifices, by the sons of\r\n    Levi, and for your oracles in your most holy places, wherein you\r\n    receive conversations, and your statutes and judgments, for the\r\n    beginning of the revelation and foundation of Zion, and for the\r\n    glory, honor, and endowment of all her municipals, are ordained\r\n    by the ordinance of my holy house, which my people are always\r\n    commanded to build unto my holy name.\"\r\n\r\nI have read quite extensively from this revelation, now let us examine\r\nand see just what is meant. At the time this revelation was given the\r\nSaints were baptizing in the Mississippi river for their dead, this was\r\na special privilege that the Lord granted them in their poverty and\r\nwhile they could prepare a place in the Temple for that ordinance. He\r\ndeclares that while that place was being built He would accept of their\r\nbaptisms in the river, but just as soon as a place could be prepared\r\nin the Temple baptisms for the dead in the river should cease. Now you\r\nwill notice that verse 31 reads:\r\n\r\n    \"But I command you, all ye my Saints, to build a house unto me; and\r\n    I grant unto you a sufficient time to build a house unto me.\"\r\n\r\nNow I wish you to note what follows:\r\n\r\n    \"And during this time your baptisms shall be acceptable unto me.\"\r\n\r\nI take it that this means that the Lord would accept of their baptisms\r\nin the river until they could prepare a place where the ordinance\r\ncould be attended to properly, and that He would not discontinue river\r\nbaptisms until they had had sufficient time to build such a place. I\r\nwant to read what the president of the \"Reorganized\" Church has to say\r\non this point. Said he:\r\n\r\n    \"Baptisms for the dead was a permissive rite.\"\r\n\r\nOf course I do not agree with him that it was a permissive rite, but to\r\ncontinue the quotation:\r\n\r\n    \"Baptism for the dead was a permissive rite; or to write more\r\n    plainly, the Church was permitted by the Lord to baptize for the\r\n    dead under certain rules.\"\r\n\r\nHere is the rule:\r\n\r\n    \"By terms stated in the revelation this permissive rite could be\r\n    performed and would be acceptable if performed in the river while\r\n    the time given the Church in which the Temple should be built was\r\n    passing. After the completion of the Temple, baptisms for the dead\r\n    were to be performed in it.\" (Saints' Herald, February 17, 1904).\r\n\r\nWe are certainly safe in saying that the Lord would not break His\r\npromise, therefore if we can discover a time when baptisms were\r\ndiscontinued in the river it will be a sign that the sufficient\r\ntime had expired, so far as baptisms in the river for the dead were\r\nconcerned. I turn to the minutes of the October conference, 1841, and\r\nread from the remarks on baptism for the dead delivered by the Prophet\r\non the third day as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"There shall be no more baptisms for the dead until the ordinance\r\n    can be attended to in the font of the Lord's house; and the Church\r\n    shall not hold another general conference, until they can meet in\r\n    said house. _For thus saith the Lord!_\" (Times and Seasons, Vol.\r\n    II., page 578).\r\n\r\nRemember this was in October, 1841--six months after the first stone\r\nof the Temple was laid. Was the Temple finished? No. Was the Church\r\nthen rejected with its dead? Verily no! for this was 1841, and I have\r\nalready referred you to the editorial of the Prophet's of May, 1842,\r\nwherein he says that never since the formation, or foundation, of the\r\nChurch was laid, have the Saints been so willing to comply with the\r\nrequisitions of Jehovah, and manifested a more ardent desire to do\r\nthe will of God, than in the building of that Temple. Therefore they\r\ncould not have been rejected. Yet the sufficient time was up.[13] What\r\nmust we then conclude? That the Temple had progressed so far that\r\nbaptisms could be performed in it for the dead in accordance with the\r\nrevelation, and it did not depend altogether, you will see, on the\r\ncomplete finishing of the building; and as the rooms were finished one\r\nby one and dedicated, they too, could be used for the ordinances of the\r\nTemple until the whole Temple was built.\r\n\r\nAre we right in our conclusion that a font had been built? Yes,\r\na temporary font had been built in the basement of the Temple--a\r\ntemporary one--but obviously one that answered the requirements of the\r\nrevelation. Moreover, in this temporary font, which was used by the\r\ncommand of the Lord through the Prophet Joseph Smith, baptisms for the\r\ndead were performed from November, 1841, until it was replaced by the\r\npermanent font, and then these baptisms continued in that until the\r\nSaints were driven from Nauvoo.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAPTISMS FOR THE DEAD OBLIGATORY.\r\n\r\nWe will now examine the thirty-second verse; it is:\r\n\r\n    \"But behold, at the end of this appointment, your baptisms for your\r\n    dead shall not be acceptable unto me.\"\r\n\r\nThat means, of course, the baptisms in the river shall not be\r\nacceptable after the font is built. But listen to this:\r\n\r\n    \"And if you do not these things at the END OF THE APPOINTMENT ye\r\n    shall be rejected as a church, with your dead, saith the Lord your\r\n    God.\"\r\n\r\nIf you do not do what things? Does it mean if you do not build the\r\nTemple at the END of the appointment? That would be absurd. It means,\r\nif you do not perform your baptisms for your dead and the ordinances\r\nfor the dead at the end--not the beginning, but the end--of the\r\nappointment, then will you be rejected with your dead. So you see\r\nit was not the failure to finish the attic, or to carve figures in\r\nthe woodwork, or embellish the building by placing pictures on the\r\nwalls, or painting them; it was not for this that the Church was to\r\nbe rejected; but it was to be rejected with its dead if it failed to\r\nperform the work in the Temple for the dead when the opportunity was\r\nafforded. Now let us see if this view is not in harmony with other\r\nScriptures. I turn to the second section of the Doctrine and Covenants.\r\nHere the angel says:\r\n\r\n    \"Behold, I will reveal unto you the Priesthood, by the hand of\r\n    Elijah the prophet, before the coming of the great and dreadful day\r\n    of the Lord.\r\n\r\n    \"And he shall plant in the hearts of the children the promises made\r\n    to the fathers, and the hearts of the children shall turn to their\r\n    fathers.\r\n\r\n    \"If it were not so, the whole earth would be UTTERLY WASTED AT ITS\r\n    COMING.\"\r\n\r\nWhy would the earth be wasted? Simply because if there is not a welding\r\nlink between the fathers and the children--which is the work for the\r\ndead--then we will all stand rejected; the whole work of God will fail\r\nand be utterly wasted. Such a condition of course, shall not be. When\r\nElijah restored this Priesthood, he said that the time spoken of had\r\nfully come, and that the dreadful day of the Lord was near, even at the\r\ndoors.\r\n\r\nLet us now see what Joseph Smith had to say in relation to this.\r\nSpeaking of the baptism and salvation for the dead, he said:\r\n\r\n    \"The GREATEST RESPONSIBILITY in this world that God has laid upon\r\n    us, is to seek after our dead. The apostle says they without us\r\n    cannot be made perfect. Now I will speak of them: I say to you,\r\n    Paul, you cannot be perfect without us; it is necessary that those\r\n    who have gone before, and those who come after us should have\r\n    salvation in common with us, and thus hath God made it OBLIGATORY\r\n    to man. Hence God said He would send Elijah.\" (Times and Seasons,\r\n    6:616).\r\n\r\nMoreover, at the conference held October, 1841, to which I have already\r\nreferred, the prophet said this:\r\n\r\n    \"Baptism for the dead is the only way that men can appear as\r\n    saviors on Mount Zion. The proclamation of the first principles of\r\n    the gospel was a means of salvation to men individually, and it was\r\n    the truth, not men, that saved them; but men by actively engaging\r\n    in rites of salvation _substitutionally_, become instrumental in\r\n    bringing multitudes of their kin into the Kingdom of God.\"\r\n\r\n    \"This doctrine\"--that is, baptism for the dead--\"he said, presents\r\n    in a clear light the wisdom and mercy of God, in preparing an\r\n    ordinance for the salvation of the dead, being baptized by proxy,\r\n    their names recorded in heaven, and they judged according to the\r\n    deeds done in the body.\"\r\n\r\nNow here comes the most important statement.\r\n\r\n    --\"This doctrine was the BURDEN OF THE SCRIPTURES. Those Saints\r\n    who NEGLECT it in behalf of their deceased relatives, do it at the\r\n    PERIL OF THEIR OWN SALVATION.\"\r\n\r\nThere we have the key to the whole situation. If we neglect the\r\nsalvation of our dead when we have the opportunity to save them, then\r\nwe ourselves will be rejected, and that is just what the revelation of\r\nJanuary 19, 1841, says. In the Doctrine and Covenants, Section 128,\r\nverse 5, we are told that baptism for the dead was prepared from before\r\nthe foundation of the world, \"for the salvation of the dead,\" mark\r\nthis, \"WHO SHOULD DIE WITHOUT A KNOWLEDGE OF THE GOSPEL!\" And in verse\r\n15:\r\n\r\n    \"And now, my dearly beloved brethren and sisters, let me assure you\r\n    that these are principles in relation to the dead and the living\r\n    that cannot be lightly passed over, as pertaining to our salvation,\r\n    as Paul says concerning the fathers, 'that they without us cannot\r\n    be made perfect, neither can we without our dead be made perfect.'\"\r\n\r\nHere we have it in this revelation that if we do not save our dead we\r\ncannot ourselves be saved, therefore if we neglect their salvation, we\r\nourselves will be rejected. Now verse 18:\r\n\r\n    \"It is sufficient to know * * * that the earth will be smitten\r\n    with a curse, UNLESS there is a welding link of some kind or\r\n    other, between the fathers and the children, upon some subject or\r\n    other, and behold what is that subject? IT IS THE BAPTISM FOR THE\r\n    DEAD. For we without them cannot be made perfect; neither can they\r\n    without us be made perfect. Neither can they nor we be made perfect\r\n    without those who have died in the Gospel also; for it is necessary\r\n    in the ushering in of the dispensation of the fulnesss of times,\r\n    which dispensation is now beginning to usher in, that a whole and\r\n    complete and perfect union and welding together of dispensations,\r\n    and keys, and powers, and glories, should take place, and be\r\n    revealed, from the days of Adam even to the present time; and not\r\n    only this, but those things which never have been revealed from\r\n    the foundation of the world, but have been kept hid from the wise\r\n    and prudent shall be revealed unto babes and sucklings in this the\r\n    dispensation of the fulness of times.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSALVATION FOR THE DEAD IMPORTANT.\r\n\r\nNow, is it not plain to see how important this doctrine is, and why\r\nthe Saints were to be rejected? But they were not rejected for they\r\nperformed the baptisms for their dead, and are today performing the\r\nbaptisms and the ordinances for and in behalf of their dead. Therefore\r\nthey are not rejected. Again, the Prophet says that the Saints have not\r\ntoo much time to save and redeem their dead, and gather their living\r\nrelatives together that they may be saved also, before the earth will\r\nbe smitten, as revealed by Malachi. Therefore it is quite evident why\r\nthe Lord permitted them to baptize in the river, and not wait until\r\nthose ordinances could be performed in the Temple, and why He was so\r\nanxious that they should hurry and prepare a place in the Temple, where\r\nthey could be performed in accordance with the plan from before the\r\nfoundation of the world.\r\n\r\nHere is another statement that I wish to refer to. In an editorial\r\nin the Times and Seasons written by the Prophet, in volume 3, pages\r\n759-761, where he is speaking of the remarks made by the Savior to the\r\nJews, that upon them should come all the righteous blood shed upon the\r\nearth from the blood of righteous Abel, unto the blood of Zacharias,\r\nson of Barachias, who was slain between the Temple and the altar,\r\nJoseph the Prophet declares in most emphatic terms that the reason why\r\nthis blood was to come upon these Jews was, that:\r\n\r\n    \"They possessed greater privileges than any other generation, not\r\n    only as pertaining to themselves but to their dead, their sin was\r\n    greater as they not only neglected their own salvation but that\r\n    of their progenitors, and hence their blood was required at their\r\n    hands.\"\r\n\r\nNow, if these Jews were to answer for the blood of their progenitors\r\nbecause they neglected the salvation of their dead, then, may we not\r\nask; will not we have to answer for the blood of our dead if we neglect\r\nthese ordinances in their behalf? It matters not even if we have been\r\nbaptized and have had hands laid on our heads for the reception of the\r\nHoly Ghost; if we wilfully neglect the salvation of our dead, then also\r\nwe shall stand rejected of the Lord because we have rejected our dead;\r\nand just so sure their blood will be required at our hands.\r\n\r\nNow, what is the attitude of the \"Reorganized\" Church in relation to\r\nthe salvation of the dead, the neglect of which the Church--yes, and\r\nalso the individual--was to stand rejected of the Lord? I have here a\r\ncopy of a resolution that was passed by the general conference of that\r\nsect in 1886, at the time that Mr. Briggs withdrew. This resolution\r\nis in reply to his charge that he could not accept the principle of\r\n\"baptism for the dead.\" Here it is:\r\n\r\n    \"That as to the alleged Temple building and ceremonial endowments\r\n    therein, that we know of no Temple building, except as edifices\r\n    wherein to worship God, and no endowment except the endowment of\r\n    the Holy Spirit of the kind experienced by the early Saints on\r\n    Pentecost day.\"\r\n\r\n    \"'Baptism for the dead' referred to belongs to those local\r\n    questions of which the body has said by resolution:\r\n\r\n    \"'That the commandments of a local character, given to the first\r\n    organization of the Church are binding on the Reorganization only\r\n    so far as they are either reiterated or referred to as binding by\r\n    commandment to this church. And _that_ principle has neither been\r\n    reiterated nor referred to as a commandment.\"\r\n\r\nJust think of that! They declare that we were rejected because we\r\nfailed to build a house where these ordinances were to be performed,\r\nand yet they actually have the audacity to say that the work of\r\nsalvation for the dead is not binding on them because it has not\r\nbeen reiterated or referred to as a commandment binding on them.\r\nNow is that consistent? They call it a local commandment, yet we\r\nhave seen that this commandment was the burden of the Scriptures and\r\nthe greatest responsibility that God has placed upon us, and we are\r\nobliged to save our dead if we would ourselves be saved. And yet, this\r\ncommandment without which the whole earth was to be utterly wasted and\r\ndestroyed--this eternal commandment that had been prepared before the\r\nfoundation of the world--is not binding on them! \"A local commandment!\"\r\n\"A permissive rite!\" My friends, from the teachings of Joseph Smith the\r\nProphet, which I have presented, you may well judge which is the Church\r\n\"rejected with its dead.\"[14]\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes\r\n\r\n1. This statement that the Latter-day Saints were endeavoring to get\r\nbeyond the jurisdiction of the United States, which is repeated so\r\noften by anti-\"Mormon\" writers and speakers, including many devotees\r\nof the \"Reorganization,\" who vainly attempt to prove the disloyalty of\r\nthe Saints, is rather astonishing in the face of the facts of history.\r\nThe exodus to the Rocky Mountains was undertaken _of necessity_, as it\r\nwas from Missouri to Illinois, because the Saints had been ruthlessly\r\ndriven from their homes by armed mobocrats. Notwithstanding this, the\r\nChurch came to the Rocky Mountains because the Lord willed it so,\r\nfor He permitted the expulsion from Nauvoo that His purposes might\r\nbe fulfilled. The Prophet Joseph Smith, as early as 1842, received a\r\nrevelation declaring that the Saints would be driven to these valleys.\r\nThat revelation is found in the history of the Church for Saturday,\r\nAugust 6, 1842. Our friends the Reorganites, have themselves testified\r\nin their more sober moments to the truth of this grand prediction. In\r\na history published by them in 1880, and which they said was \"the aim\r\nof the publishers to place within the reach of those who cared to know,\r\na more correct standard from which to determine the character and work\r\nof Joseph Smith, the founder, under divine direction, of the Church of\r\nJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,\" \"And is the cheapest book published\r\nby the (Reorganized) Church.\" They record the following:\r\n\r\n\"Just at this time (1842) also occurred Joseph's first marked prophecy,\r\non record, concerning the removal of the Saints to the Rocky Mountains.\r\nSays the Record:\r\n\r\n\"Saturday 6th, (August, 1842). Passed over the river to Montrose,\r\nIowa, in company with General Adams, Colonel Brewer, and others, and\r\nwitnessed the installation of the officers of the Rising Sun Lodge of\r\nAncient York Masons, at Montrose, by General James Adams, Deputy Grand\r\nMaster of Illinois. While the Deputy Grand Master was engaged in giving\r\nthe requisite instructions to the Master Elect, I had a conversation\r\nwith a number of brethren, in the shade of the building, on the subject\r\nof our persecutions in Missouri, and the constant annoyance which has\r\nfollowed us since we were driven from the State. I prophesied that the\r\nSaints would continue to suffer much affliction, and would be driven\r\nto the Rocky Mountains, many would apostatize, others would be put\r\nto death by our persecutors, or lose their lives in consequence of\r\nexposure or disease, and some would live to go and assist in making\r\nsettlements and building cities, and see the Saints become a mighty\r\npeople in the midst of the Rocky Mountains.\"\r\n\r\n\"The exodus is a great historic fact. It would do violence to history\r\nto expunge this record. The Twelve, however, may have shaped the record\r\nthus to fit their own events. It is not even affirmed that Joseph gave\r\nsuch a revelation to the Church; but the historical landmark, pointing\r\nto the Rocky Mountains, is this prophecy to his Masonic brethren, on\r\nthe 6th of August, 1842, just about five years before the feet of the\r\npioneers emerged from the last mountain gorge into the beautiful\r\nvalley of the Great Salt Lake.\" (Tullidge's Life of Joseph Smith,\r\nLamoni edition, page 398-9).\r\n\r\nIn February 1844 a company was selected to go and explore Oregon\r\nand California (Utah then being a portion of what was called \"Upper\r\nCalifornia,\") for the purpose of selecting a site where the Saints\r\ncould build a city. The minutes of this meeting say: \"At a meeting\r\nof the Twelve, at the Mayor's office, Nauvoo, February 21, 1844,\r\nseven o'clock, p. m., Brigham Young, Parley P. Pratt, Orson Pratt,\r\nWilford Woodruff, John Taylor, George A. Smith, Willard Richards and\r\nfour others being present, called by previous notice, by instruction\r\nof President Joseph Smith on the 20th instant, for the purpose of\r\nselecting a company to explore Oregon and California, and select a site\r\nfor a new city for the Saints.\"\r\n\r\nJonathan Dunham, Phineas H. Young, David D. Yearsley and David Fullmer,\r\nvolunteered to go; and Alphonzo Young, James Emmett, George D. Watt,\r\nand Daniel Spencer were requested to go. These brethren were requested\r\nto meet with the council on the following Friday evening at the\r\nAssembly Room, and the history of the Prophet continues: \"Met with the\r\nTwelve in the Assembly Room (Friday 23rd) concerning the Oregon and\r\nCalifornia Exploring Expedition; Hyrum and Sidney present. I told them\r\nI wanted an exploration of all that mountain country. Perhaps it would\r\nbe best to go direct to Santa Fe. Send twenty-five men: let them preach\r\nthe Gospel wherever they go. Let that man go that can raise $500, a\r\ngood horse and mule, a double-barrel gun, one barrel rifle, and the\r\nother smooth bore, a saddle and bridle, a pair of revolving pistols,\r\nbowie-knife, and a good saber. Appoint a leader, and let him beat up\r\nfor volunteers. I want every man that goes to be a king and a priest.\r\nWhen he gets on the mountains he may want to talk with his God; when\r\nwith the savage nations have power to govern, etc. If we don't get\r\nvolunteers wait until after the election.\"\r\n\r\nOn this and other occasions shortly following, these volunteered to go:\r\nGeorge D. Watt, Samuel Bent, Joseph A. Kelting, David Fullmer, James\r\nEmmett, Daniel Spencer, Samuel Rolfe, Daniel Avery, Samuel W. Richards,\r\nAlmon L. Fuller, Hosea Stout, Thomas S. Edwards, Moses Smith and Rufus\r\nBeach. There were also others. It is also a fact that on the evening\r\nof June 22, 1844, because of persecution, the Prophet Joseph Smith,\r\nhis brother Hyrum and a few others crossed the Mississippi river with\r\nthe intention of going to the Rocky Mountains, beyond the persecutions\r\nof their enemies. The following day they were accused of cowardice by\r\nfalse friends who declared that they were fleeing from the flock in\r\ntime of danger. This falsehood so wounded the Prophet who had stood in\r\nthe breach from the beginning to protect the Saints, that he returned\r\nto Nauvoo, and gave himself up declaring that if his life was of no\r\nvalue to his friends, it was of none to himself. Four days later he\r\nsuffered martyrdom, sealing his testimony with his blood.\r\n\r\nMr. George Derry, himself a Reorganite, in the Saints' Herald for\r\nJanuary 31, 1906, in reply to the editor who doubted that any such\r\nintention as a settlement in the West was contemplated by Joseph Smith,\r\nwrote the following:\r\n\r\n\"In reading the article in Saints' Herald, No. 46, 'The Editor at\r\nHome,' I got the impression that the writer was in doubt as to the\r\ncorrect statement of S. W. Richards that he was one of twenty-five\r\nmen that were selected by Joseph Smith, Jr., to go out west to try to\r\nfind a location for the Saints beyond the reach of mobs--a condition\r\nno doubt desirable in those trying times. S. W. Richards was president\r\nof the Church in the British Isles while I lived in London. I was\r\npresident of a branch there and I was often brought in contact with\r\nother presiding officers as they met in council every month. The London\r\nconference was composed of forty-two branches, was often visited by\r\nthe president of the mission and his counselors. I well remember S. W.\r\nRichards and others making the same statement at one of our monthly\r\nmeetings, for they frequently dwelt at considerable length on the\r\npersecutions and trials of the Saints in that day. I believed the\r\nstatements then--fifty-three years ago. I have no reason to reject it\r\nnow. I have never heard it disproved. The testimony of S. W. Richards\r\nis as true in 1905 [See Era, Vol. 7, 927] as it was in 1853, that the\r\ncompany was organized. Recording the facts would not add to their\r\n_truthfulness_. I never heard that the company went west, but the\r\ncompany was _organized_, although conditions were changed.\r\n\r\n\"In reading of the wonderful manifestations given in Kirtland, I\r\nfind the following vision seen by Joseph Smith: 'I saw Brigham Young\r\nstanding in a strange land in the far South and West in a desert place\r\non a rock in the midst of about a dozen men of color. He was preaching\r\nto them in their own tongue. I saw the twelve apostles of the Lamb that\r\n_now are_ upon the earth standing together in a circle, much fatigued.\r\nI finally saw them in the celestial Kingdom of God.'\r\n\r\n\"The conditions here stated very much resemble the conditions existing\r\nin Utah extending four hundred miles south of Salt Lake City. Here is\r\ncertainly strong indication, if visions are reliable, that Brigham\r\nYoung with the rest of the apostles would go to a strange land\r\nbeyond the bounds of civilization. And in view of the mobbings and\r\ndrivings they had to endure, is it any wonder that they should seek\r\na quiet resting-place? Who shall say there was anything dishonorable\r\nin organizing a company by Joseph Smith, Jr., to seek out a quiet\r\nresting-place where they could be free to worship God in peace, none\r\nto make them afraid? The writer seems to have serious doubts as to\r\nthe truth of the statements of the two men he met in Salt Lake City,\r\nbecause we have no record of the preparations made. I never heard it\r\nstated that the company did go west, because conditions changed, but\r\nthe fact still remains--the company was formed, firearms and provisions\r\nwere agreed upon, but as to what happened to change the program we\r\nhave no record. But that the company was formed under the direction\r\nand choice of Joseph Smith is beyond doubt.\" As early as 1831, the\r\nLord in a revelation (Doc. & Cov. 49:25) declared that \"Zion shall\r\nflourish upon the hills and rejoice upon the mountains, and shall be\r\nassembled together unto the place which I have appointed.\" When Brigham\r\nYoung therefore, and the apostles, lead the Church to the valleys\r\nof the mountains, it was in fulfillment of the word of the Lord to\r\nJoseph Smith, uttered first, in March, 1831, second in August 1842,\r\nand moreover, it was but carrying out the design of the Prophet Joseph\r\nSmith. When men accuse the Saints of fleeing to the west desiring to\r\nget beyond the borders of the United States, and of being disloyal to\r\nthe American government, they not only place themselves at variance\r\nwith the facts of history, but utter a miserable falsehood that merits\r\nonly the severest contempt. In B. H. Roberts' \"Succession,\" pages 109\r\nto 126, a complete array of evidence regarding the exodus as outlined\r\nby Joseph Smith may be found.\r\n\r\n2. In several of the revelations given to the Church in the beginning,\r\nthe doctrine of common consent is made mandatory. In the revelation of\r\nApril 6, 1830, the date of the organization of the Church--the Lord\r\nsays: \"The elders are to receive their licenses from other elders,\r\nby vote of the Church (branch) to which they belong, or from the\r\nconferences.\" * * * * * No person is to be ordained to any office in\r\nthis Church, where there is a regularly organized branch of the same,\r\nwithout the vote of that Church.\" In section 26, verse 2: \"All things\r\nshall be done by common consent in the Church, by much prayer and\r\nfaith, for all things ye shall receive by faith.\" See also Sec. 124:144.\r\n\r\nThe Saints by vote accepted the Twelve Apostles as the presiding\r\nquorum of the Church at this special conference August 8, and again\r\nat the regular conference in October. This fact settled the matter of\r\nsuccession according to the revelations. These authorities and their\r\nsuccessors, have been sustained at each conference of the Church, twice\r\na year, and at the quarterly conferences of the various stakes four\r\ntimes a year from that day to this. The question of succession was,\r\ntherefore, settled at Nauvoo when the assembled Saints voted to sustain\r\nthe Apostles as the presiding quorum of the Church. The attempt of any\r\nparty or parties, before any other body, to set up the Church and to\r\nordain officers in conflict with the action of the Church on the dates\r\npreviously mentioned, would be illegally done; just as much so as if in\r\nthe municipality, state or nation, after the majority of the citizens\r\nhad elected officers (and that almost unanimously) to serve them, a few\r\ndisgruntled, defeated, candidates and their sympathizers should appoint\r\nanother election, hold it by themselves and then declare that the\r\nregularly and properly elected officers were rejected and unauthorized\r\nto serve. Such a thing in the nation could be no more foolish or absurd\r\nthan were the attempts of apostates to set up a _new organization_\r\nof the Church from a handful of disgruntled office-seekers and their\r\nsympathizers. In one case there would be as much authority as in the\r\nother and no more.\r\n\r\nBut the contention of Reorganites has been, that the apostles assumed\r\nauthority and powers that did not belong to them. That their duty was\r\nin the world and it was the prerogative of the high council of Nauvoo\r\nwith William Marks and counselors, at their head, to direct the affairs\r\nof the Church. They say:\r\n\r\n\"That the Twelve usurped authority, and assumed privileges and duties\r\nafter the death of Joseph and Hyrum which did not belong to them, is\r\nseen in the fact that their mission and calling was to travel abroad\r\namong the branches, and throughout the world, preaching, organizing\r\nbranches, thus building up the Church outside of Zion and the organized\r\nstakes. That such was their mission and calling may be seen in the law\r\nof the Church which is further confirmed in the teachings of the martyr\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\"'The Twelve _will have no right_ to go into Zion, or any of its\r\nstakes, and there undertake to regulate the affairs thereof, where\r\nthere is a standing high council. But it is _their duty to go abroad_\r\nand regulate all matters relative to the different branches of the\r\nChurch.' Joseph Smith's History, Mill. Star, Vol. 15, p. 261.\r\n\r\n\"After the death of Joseph, the Twelve superseded, by their arrogant,\r\ndespotic acts, the standing high council at the stake of Nauvoo,\r\nof both which the late President Wm. Marks was president. And this\r\nusurpation thus begun, has been perpetuated till now; entailing\r\ndarkness, discord, and misrule upon that faction of the Church.\" (The\r\nSuccessor pp. 14, 15).\r\n\r\nAlexander H. Smith, presiding patriarch of the \"Reorganized\" church,\r\nand then one of their \"apostles,\" made the following statement, March\r\n29, 1885, in Salt Lake City:\r\n\r\n\"At the evening meeting his remarks were directed to the subject of\r\nthe reorganization of the church, in which he showed why this measure\r\nbecame necessary, and how Brigham Young and the Twelve Apostles usurped\r\nthe leadership. He quoted from declarations of Joseph Smith and Brigham\r\nYoung, and the revelations to show what the organization and order of\r\nthe priesthood were, and how, in case of death of the prophet, the\r\nword of the Lord, was to be given to the Saints. It was to be through\r\nthe high council of the chief or center stake of Zion, in which\r\njurisdiction the Twelve Apostles had no business whatever. Their work\r\nand powers extended only to matters beyond the borders of Zion. When\r\nthe prophet was killed, therefore, the right and duty to rule fell upon\r\nthe high council at Nauvoo, of which Elder Marks was the president. But\r\nBrigham Young and eight others of the Twelve, brushed this order of the\r\npriesthood to one side, and seized the reins of government themselves.\"\r\n(Saints' Herald, Vol. 32:342).\r\n\r\nThis argument set forth in the \"Successor\" and by Alexander H. Smith,\r\nwhich has been quite universal in the \"Reorganized\" Church, would\r\nnot be quite so bad if it was not for a number of insurmountable\r\ndifficulties and objections that stand in the way. In the first place\r\nthe objectors fail to state that the powers of the high council and\r\nstake presidency at Nauvoo, were limited to the affairs of the stake,\r\nand outside of that they held no jurisdiction. Following the martyrdom,\r\nthe Church was considering matters that affected the whole Church\r\nand not merely the stake at Nauvoo. The Twelve Apostles, therefore,\r\nassumed by legal right their proper place as the presiding quorum of\r\nthe Church, and were so sustained. The revelation on Priesthood (sec.\r\n107) says the Twelve Apostles, form a quorum equal in authority with\r\nthe First Presidency (verse 24) and it was the duty of the Apostles,\r\nnot only to ordain evangelical ministers (Patriarchs) but also to\r\nordain and set in order all the other officers of the Church, (verse\r\n58). We read that \"God hath set some in the Church, _first_ apostles,\r\nsecondarily prophets, thirdly teachers,\" etc. (I. Cor. 12:28) not\r\n_first_ high councils and presidents of Stakes. Neither are the duties\r\nof the Apostles confined to their labors out side of the Stakes of Zion.\r\n\r\n3. If Jason W. Briggs joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\r\nSaints June 6, 1841, and resided in Wisconsin from that time till 1854,\r\nhe cannot be considered a faithful member of the Church, \"who desired\r\nto do the will of heaven;\" for in remaining at Beloit during all these\r\nyears he was going contrary to the word of the Lord given to the\r\nProphet in 1841. On January 15th of that year, the Lord said through\r\nthe Presidency, Joseph Smith, Sidney Rigdon and Hyrum Smith, and on\r\ndivers other occasions, that the Saints scattered abroad should come\r\nto Nauvoo and Hancock county. Here is the command: \"Let all those who\r\n_appreciate the blessings of the Gospel_, and realize the importance\r\nof _obeying the commandments of heaven_ * * * first prepare for the\r\ngeneral gathering. _Let them dispose of their effects as fast as\r\ncircumstances will possibly admit_, without making too great sacrifice,\r\nand _remove to our city and county_. * * * _This cannot be too forcibly\r\nimpressed_ on the _minds of all_, and the elders are hereby instructed\r\nto proclaim this word in all places where the Saints reside in their\r\npublic ministrations, _for this is according to the instructions we\r\nhave received from the Lord_. (My italics.)\r\n\r\nAgain, on May 24, 1841, the Prophet said this gathering to Hancock and\r\nLee counties was \"important and should be attended to _by all who feel\r\nan interest in the prosperity of this corner stone of Zion_,\" and the\r\nTwelve Apostles a short time later, under the direction of the First\r\nPresidency, in an epistle to the Saints, said: \"We say to _all Saints\r\nwho desire to do the will of heaven_, arise, and tarry not, but come\r\nup hither to the place of gathering _as speedily as possible_.\" (My\r\nitalics.)\r\n\r\nMr. Briggs visited Nauvoo once in 1843, but again returned to Wisconsin\r\n(Reorg. Hist. 3:737) where he lived until 1854, either defying this\r\ncommandment or else ignoring it, thus proving he was not in harmony\r\nwith the Presidency of the Church, and was one who did not \"desire to\r\ndo the will of heaven.\" If he had been faithful he would have gone\r\nto Nauvoo and remained there and assisted in the building of the\r\nTemple, but he did not do so, _was not diligent_ and went contrary to\r\nthe \"instructions\" the Presidency had \"received from the Lord.\" That\r\nthe Lord would not choose such an unfaithful servant to build up His\r\nChurch, give him revelations and cause him to stand as president pro\r\ntem., in the place of the Seed of Joseph Smith, which Reorganites claim\r\nJason W. Briggs did, is obvious and requires no further comment.\r\n\r\n4. I have been taken to task for saying that about this time Jason\r\nW. Briggs organized the Beloit branch for the Strang organization.\r\nReorganites claim that the Beloit branch was raised up in 1842 or\r\n1843--they don't know just when. For the sake of the argument we will\r\ngrant that a branch was organized at Beloit in 1842 or 1843. If so,\r\nthe faithful members of that branch removed to Nauvoo, agreeable to\r\nthe commandment of the Lord previously quoted. Those who remained\r\nat Beloit, like Jason W. Briggs, were not faithful in that they did\r\nnot \"desire to do the will of heaven.\" And what has been said of Mr.\r\nBriggs, will also apply to them. Nevertheless, between 1846 and 1848,\r\nJason W. Briggs organized the Beloit branch for Strang's organization,\r\nor else the Reorganite history is at fault. They say that in 1849 the\r\nBeloit branch was a Strangite branch, and remained with Mr. Strang\r\nuntil 1850 (Reorg. Hist., 3:737). Most of these members--and they were\r\nfew--after they left the Strangites joined the organization of William\r\nB. Smith's organizations were without authority, so whatever power\r\nthose unfaithful members had before 1844, they lost when they joined\r\nthese apostate organizations of Strang, et al. For they could not take\r\npower or authority with them. This truth is expressed by an officer\r\nof the Reorganized Church who said, at Galland's Grove, Iowa, October\r\n25, 1863: \"Whenever individuals claiming authority under the church\r\nas organized by the first Joseph, become members of any faction, they\r\nimmediately become divested of all authority except that received from\r\nthat faction.\" (True Saints' Herald, Vol. 4, page 158).\r\n\r\n5. In a vain effort to blind the readers of the Saints' Herald the\r\n\"defender\" tries to make it appear that I state here that Zenas H.\r\nGurley left the \"Reorganized\" church; but from the way he writes it,\r\nit is evident that he doesn't himself believe that any such attempt\r\nwas made. Zenas H. Gurley, Sen., died August 28, 1871, and in speaking\r\nof his _family_ in 1886--fifteen years later--it is obvious that the\r\nreference does not include him. That Mr. Gurley left them when he got\r\non the other side, I have my reasons to believe, but at no time in the\r\nentire publication has he been confounded with his son of the same\r\nname. The son is mentioned _but once_ and then only incidentally and\r\nunavoidably in connection with the withdrawal of Jason W. Briggs from\r\nthe \"Reorganization.\" The _family_ of Zenas H. Gurley mentioned here\r\nconsisted of his wife Margaret, sons Zenas H. (who was one of their\r\n\"Apostles\") Edwin H., and their wives. The attempt of the writer of\r\nthe \"defense\" to throw dust in the eyes of the readers of the _Saints'\r\nHerald_ as he has done here and at many other points, is contemptible.\r\n\r\n6. In the \"defense\" that appeared in the Saints' Herald, June 30, 1909,\r\nin answer to this, the statement is made that, \"Those were received\r\nwhose original baptisms had been performed either previously to 1844\r\nor by men who held authority previous to 1844.\" This declaration helps\r\ntheir cause not at all, for whatever authority any of those men who\r\nwere active in these various \"factions\" may have held, when in the\r\nChurch, they could not take it with them, when they withdrew. Moreover,\r\naction was taken against them and they were divested of all authority\r\nby the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, from which their\r\nauthority came. And what authentic proof have they to offer that these\r\nmen had authority in the Prophet's day? Zenas H. Gurley, and Jason\r\nW. Briggs were confessedly, the two most active and most noted in\r\nthis work of the \"Reorganization.\" Mr. Gurley, it is true, was senior\r\npresident of the 21st quorum of Seventy at Nauvoo before he left the\r\nChurch, having been ordained under the direction of President Joseph\r\nYoung. He claimed it was by virtue of this office in the Priesthood\r\nthat he officiated originally in the bringing forth of the \"New\r\nOrganization,\" in 1852. (True Saints' Herald, Vol. I, page 56). Yet the\r\npresident of the \"Reorganization\" himself repudiates that authority.\r\n(See section on Succession, subject _Properly Ordained?_)\r\n\r\nIt is claimed by the \"Reorganization\" that Mr. Briggs was an Elder in\r\n1842, but that also is mere sayso, there is no authentic record for it.\r\nIn proof of this I submit the following correspondence.\r\n\r\n                                           Salt Lake City., Feb. 21, 1905.\r\n\r\n    _Mr. Heman C. Smith, Church Historian, Reorganized Church_.\r\n\r\n    Dear Sir: The 3rd volume of the \"History of the Reorganized Church,\"\r\n    page 737, states that Jason W. Briggs was ordained an Elder in 1842.\r\n    Will you kindly inform me who ordained him and the date of the\r\n    ordination; also the authority on which the statement of the\r\n    ordination is made, and oblige?\r\n\r\n                                    Very respectfully,\r\n                                          JOSEPH F. SMITH, JR.\r\n\r\nThe reply dated Lamoni, Iowa, Feb. 26, 1905, is as follows:\r\n\r\n    _Mr. Joseph F. Smith, Jr._ _Salt Lake City, U._\r\n\r\n    Dear Sir: Yours of February 21, is at hand and contents noted.\r\n\r\n    Replying we will say we are not able to inform you as to who\r\n    officiated in the ordination of Elder Jason W. Briggs to the office\r\n    of Elder; nor can we give you the date any nearer than the year 1842.\r\n\r\n    The authority upon which the statement was made is the sworn statement\r\n    of Elder Briggs in the Temple Lot Case. See Plaintiff's Abstract, page\r\n    393.\r\n\r\n                                     Very respectfully,\r\n                                           HEMAN C. SMITH.\r\n\r\nIn the formation of the \"New Organization\" (now the \"Reorganization\")\r\nMr. Briggs acted by virtue of the office of High Priest. Mr. Gurley\r\nsays they had \"two High Priests (Mr. Briggs being one of them) and one\r\nsenior President of the Seventies.\" (The Seventy being himself). See\r\nTrue Saints' Herald, Vol. I, page 56. And in the \"revelation\" given by\r\nMr. Deam it was stated that \"It is my will that you respect authority\r\nin my Church, therefore let the greatest among you preside at your\r\nconference.\" (True Saints' Herald, Vol. I, p. 55). Mr. Jason W. Briggs\r\nwas chosen to preside (p. 57). Where did he get his authority as a High\r\nPriest by which he had the right to preside? From James J. Strang. The\r\nVoree record of conferences, April 8, 1846, contains the following:\r\n\"Resolved unanimously that Jason W. Briggs be ordained a High Priest.\r\nOrdination under the hands of President James J. Strang and William\r\nMarks.\"\r\n\r\n7. In reply to this the Reorganite \"defender\" declares that I have not\r\nbeen fair to Mr. Briggs, that if he believed \"even one section out\r\nof what was in excess of one hundred, both as to its genuineness and\r\nauthenticity, it would necessarily follow that he believed to an extent\r\nin the mission of Joseph Smith through whom it was given, in that case\r\nJoseph F. Smith, Jr., could not truthfully use the language he did in\r\ndescribing Briggs' attitude toward the Standard works of the Church.\" *\r\n* * * Mr. Briggs denied the _plenary_ inspiration of the sacred books;\r\nbut that is neither a denial of the authenticity, or of the partiality\r\nof their inspiration.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a mere quibble. Mr. Briggs denied the gathering of Israel;\r\ntemple building and the ceremonial endowments therein; the salvation\r\nof the dead through the temple ordinances, which the Prophet Joseph\r\nsaid was \"the burden of the Scriptures;\" the law of tithing and of\r\nconsecration, the only law by which Zion could be redeemed and built;\r\nthe right of Joseph Smith or any other man to be a sole mouthpiece of\r\nGod to the Church; the plenary inspiration and consequent absolute\r\nauthority of the _Scriptures_; and the revelation on temple building.\r\nWhat else he did not believe is not stated; but _if_ there is any\r\nfundamental principle in the mission of the Prophet Joseph, or in the\r\nScriptures that he _did believe_, surely he ought to have full credit\r\nfor it!\r\n\r\n8. The writer of the \"defense\" also very peevishly objects to the\r\nstatement that Mr. Briggs was unstable to the last. He says: \"If\r\nunstable and discontented _to_ the last, he could not have been stable\r\nand contented for a generation preceding the 'last'. If stable and\r\ncontented for upwards of thirty years preceding the last (1886,) then\r\nMr. Smith uttered an untruth, then he reflected a falsehood, when\r\nhe said Briggs was 'unstable' and discontent 'to the last.' Why not\r\ntell the truth about him even though an 'apostate?' I see no excuse\r\nfor reflecting on his stability any part of his life. If he stepped\r\nmomentarily aside from his path in the early part of his life it was\r\nbecause his north star was obscured by a cloud he could not avoid;\r\nbut as soon as the cloud disappeared and his guiding star was again\r\nvisible, he resumed his pathway. No lack of stability there. * * * *\r\nJoseph F. Smith, Jr., should tell the truth, even about the dead.\"\r\n\r\nAnother quibble. This is rather a severe arraignment to come from a\r\nmember of the \"Reorganized\" Church, which organization has been from\r\nits beginning so energetic in maligning the leaders of the Church of\r\nJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, both living and dead, accusing them\r\nof every wickedness under the sun, even going so far as to accuse\r\nPresident Young of being an accomplice in the death of the Prophet\r\nJoseph Smith. (See R. C. Evans, in Toronto Star, of January 28, 1905,\r\nand Saints' Herald, Vol. 32:190.)\r\n\r\nWell, let us see wherein we have wrongfully accused Mr. Briggs. He\r\njoined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1841; failed\r\nto gather at Nauvoo when commanded; left the Church in 1846 during the\r\nexodus, \"because he had no root;\" joined James J. Strang in 1846 and\r\nremained with him until 1850; left Mr. Strang and followed William\r\nSmith until 1851; left William Smith and joined with Zenas H. Gurley\r\nin the \"New Organization of the Church,\" which finally resulted in the\r\nforming of the \"Reorganized\" Church; remained with this organization\r\nuntil 1886, when he withdrew from it and died at Harris, Colorado,\r\nJanuary 11, 1899, rejecting the work he performed in all these\r\norganizations. Moreover, he was \"ordained\" April 8, 1846 to the office\r\nof \"High Priest\" by James J. Strang, and declared that Strang was\r\nJoseph Smith's legal successor as this letter will show:\r\n\r\n\"The following letter was written in answer to one from Mr. Briggs of\r\nWisconsin. His letter is too scurrilous to appear in print, therefore\r\nwe publish only the reply of Mr. Bacon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Beaver Island, July 18th, 1851.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Briggs:\r\n\r\n\"Sir: Some time since I received a letter from you in which you claim\r\nto take the liberty to write to me, on the ground that our acquaintance\r\nhad been such as to forbid personal enmities; and, therefore, you would\r\ncarry out the precept: 'Do unto others as you would have others do unto\r\nyou;' and that I was less orthodox in the pretenses of Strang, etc.,\r\nthan some others. * * * * * I will not notice the argument, powerful as\r\nit may be, which you assert you have found upon examination, touching\r\nthe letter of appointment. But what examination can this be, in which\r\nyou have found out that you spoke that which was not true? _When you\r\ndeclared in public congregations, at your own fireside, and at the\r\nfireside of your neighbors_, that Joseph Smith wrote with his own\r\nhand the 'Letter of Appointment' (for you saw him in vision) and your\r\nsurprise and faith in the 'knocking spirits' of New York, from the fact\r\nthat they (the spirits) asserted the same?\"\r\n\r\nHe represented the Beloit and Prairie branches of Strang's church at\r\nthe conference held in October, 1848, (Voree Record) and traveled quite\r\nextensively for that cult from 1846 to 1850. When he joined William\r\nB. Smith he acknowledged him as Prophet and leader, was ordained by\r\nWilliam B. Smith, an \"Apostle.\" After he left William B. Smith and\r\njoined Zenas H. Gurley he claimed to have a revelation embodying the\r\nvery things he repudiated when he withdrew from the \"Reorganization.\"\r\n\r\nTo Mathias F. Cowley, in the presence of others, Mr. Briggs, a\r\nshort time before his death in answer to the question whether the\r\n\"revelation\" he received in 1851 was true or not, said: \"You know we\r\nlearn by experience. I would not like to claim it to be a revelation\r\nnow, but it is just as good as any revelation that was given to Joseph\r\nSmith.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough he remained with the \"Reorganized\" Church for thirty years,\r\nif this record does not show that he was unstable of character at the\r\nbeginning all the way through and \"to the end,\" pray tell, what does\r\ninstability mean!\r\n\r\n9. The members of the \"Reorganized\" Church in the beginning laid great\r\nstress on the statement that the Prophet Joseph Smith was smitten by\r\nthe shaft of death (D. & C. 85th sec.) for putting forth his hand to\r\nsteady the ark of God, and that his successor should be the \"one mighty\r\nand strong,\" the Lord should send, \"holding the sceptre of power in his\r\nhand, clothed with light for a covering, whose mouth shall utter words,\r\neternal words; while his bowels shall be a fountain of truth, to set in\r\norder the house of God, and to arrange by lot the inheritances of the\r\nSaints, whose names are found, and the names of their fathers, and of\r\ntheir children, enrolled in the book of the law of God.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Briggs in his \"revelation\" says the Prophet's successor should be\r\none mighty and strong and one of his seed, and for years the claim\r\nwas made that Joseph Smith the present head of the \"Reorganization,\"\r\nwas that personage. This is emphatically declared in the \"Successor,\"\r\n(revised edition) and in various numbers of the \"Saints' Herald\" and\r\nother of their publications. This is from page 66, Vol. 17, True L.\r\nD. S. Herald: \"God foreknew the character of sister Emma--that she\r\nwould be faithful and true to him who had called her--and he _elected_\r\nher to be the mother of the successor of the Martyr--the \"one mighty\r\nand strong,\" who is \"to set in order the _house_ of God, (i. e., the\r\nchurch; see I. Tim. iii. 15; I. Pet. iv. 17; Heb. iii. 6), and arrange\r\nby lot the inheritances of the Saints; the man who shall lead them (the\r\nSaints) like as Moses led the children of Israel, (which was by direct\r\nrevelation from God), and who, when sent of God, would find the Saints\r\nin 'bondage,' from which they should be 'led out' by power, (of God)\r\n'and with a stretched out arm.'\"\r\n\r\nThat's the way they formerly gave it; but they have been forced to\r\nrecede because their president has not come up to this standard of the\r\none spoken of in the Prophet's revelation. Therefore they have, since\r\n1900, resolved:\r\n\r\n\"Whereas, we have received no divine communication authorizing any\r\nparticular interpretation of the revelation before us; and as the\r\nReorganized Church has never taken action upon the matter;\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, that we leave it an open question, to be decided as God\r\nmay develop His purposes among us, while we acknowledge the leading\r\nfeatures in it to be prominently characteristic of Jesus Christ.\" (From\r\na letter by Joseph Smith of the \"Reorganization\" in my possession--J.\r\nF. S., Jr.)\r\n\r\nThis is rather a hard jolt to Mr. Briggs' \"revelation.\"\r\n\r\n10. The Reorganite \"defender\" says, \"Also, we wish Mr. Smith to note,\r\nthat the Lord in the same connection says, 'If my people will hearken\r\nto my voice,' they shall not be moved out of their place. Were they\r\nmoved? Yes, they were cannonaded from Nauvoo, their enemies scattered\r\nthem, some of them went to Utah. Was it because they \"hearkened,\" or\r\nbecause they had not hearkened?\"\r\n\r\nHe misinterprets the Scriptures. Thus do they read:\r\n\r\n\"And if my people will hearken unto my voice, _and unto the voice of\r\nmy servants whom I have appointed to lead my people_, behold, verily I\r\nsay unto you, they shall not be moved out of their place\" (verse 45).\r\nWho these _servants_ were that the Saints should _\"hearken\"_ to, the\r\nLord informs us in verses 124 to 129 of this same section. \"First, I\r\ngive unto you Hyrum Smith, to be a Patriarch unto you, * * * I give\r\nunto you Joseph Smith, to be a presiding elder over all my Church. *\r\n* * I give unto him for counselors my servant Sidney Rigdon, and my\r\nservant William Law. * * * * I give unto you my servant Brigham Young,\r\nto be a President over the Twelve traveling council, which Twelve hold\r\nthe keys to open up the authority of my kingdom upon the four corners\r\nof the earth, and after that to send my word to every creature; They\r\nare--Heber C. Kimball, Parley P. Pratt, Orson Pratt, Orson Hyde,\r\nWilliam Smith, John Taylor, John E. Page, Wilford Woodruff, Willard\r\nRichards, George A. Smith.\" These were the general authorities who\r\nwere to be _\"hearkened\"_ to. And the people hearkened to the Prophets\r\nJoseph and Hyrum Smith until their death, then the right of presidency\r\nfell on the shoulders of the Twelve. The faithful Saints \"hearkened\" to\r\nthem and helped them to build the Temple. But the unfaithful rejected\r\nthese servants whom the Lord in this revelation gave to the Church\r\nfor the Saints to hearken to, departed from Nauvoo, refused to comply\r\nwith the command of the Lord to build His house, and were consequently\r\n_moved out of their place_ in the Church into the \"Reorganization.\" The\r\nmoving \"out of their place\" did not refer to the location (Nauvoo) but\r\nto their place in the Kingdom of God; or, the Church of Jesus Christ\r\nof Latter-day Saints. And all who refused to obey this commandment\r\nand hearken to these _servants_ were removed from the Church. \"But if\r\nthey will not hearken to my voice, _nor unto the voice of these men\r\nwhom I have appointed_, they shall not be blest, because they pollute\r\nmine holy grounds, and mine holy ordinances, and charters, and my holy\r\nwords which I give unto them. And it shall come to pass, That if you\r\nbuild a house unto my name, and _do not do the things that I say_, (i.\r\ne., hearken to \"the voice of these men whom I have appointed\") I will\r\nnot perform the oath which I make unto you, neither fulfil the promise\r\nwhich ye expect at my hands, saith the Lord.\" (verses 46-7).\r\n\r\n11. The Reorganite response to this is as follows: \"Not by any means,\r\nno such an indication. We have seen that they were diligent _in_ May\r\n1842--not _up to_. The corner-stone of the edifice had been laid April\r\n6, 1841, over a year from the date of the quotation. Room for a great\r\ndeal of lagging between those two periods of time.\"\r\n\r\n\"The next quotation is from Hyrum Smith (no reference) at the April\r\nConference, 1844, who speaks of, as Joseph F. Smith [Jr.], puts it, the\r\n'willingness of the Saints to do the work as late as 1844.' Yes, but he\r\ndoes not say they had been willing afforded time _up to_ 1844. From May\r\n1842, to April, 1844, (nearly two years), afforded time to be guilty of\r\nlethargy and to falter enough to incur the penalty the fiat of the Lord\r\nhad fixed.\"\r\n\r\nSuch miserable, puerile, balderdash set forth as argument, is\r\ndisgusting. Nevertheless it is characteristic of the \"defense\"\r\nwriter who, throughout, argues in this fashion, failing to present\r\nthe quotations he attacks for fear his readers will discover his\r\ndishonorable methods. He was afraid to present to his readers the\r\nquotation from the remarks of Patriarch Hyrum Smith and the quotation\r\nfrom the Prophet wherein he said:\r\n\r\n\"Never since the formation of this Church was laid have we seen\r\nmanifest a greater willingness to comply with the requisitions of\r\nJehovah, a more ardent desire to do the will of God; more strenuous\r\nexertions used or greater sacrifices made, than have been SINCE _the\r\nLord said_, LET THE TEMPLE BE BUILT BY THE TITHING OF MY PEOPLE!\"\r\n\r\nThe reasons he did not give these quotations is, that he knew his\r\nreaders would see his trickery and deception. Then he goes on to argue\r\nthat the Saints were not _diligent_ in September 1841, because the Lord\r\nsaid at that time: \"Let the work of my Temple, and _all the works which\r\nI have appointed unto you_, be continued on and not cease, let _your\r\ndiligence_ and _your perseverance_, and _patience_, and _your works be\r\nredoubled_, and you shall in no wise lose your reward.\" (My italics).\r\nTherefore, he argues, \"they were not sufficiently diligent at that\r\ntime,\" because they were commanded to _redouble_ their works. \"That at\r\nleast makes one positive break in Mr. Smith's chain of diligence.\"\r\n\r\nLet us see: their works that were to be redoubled were not confined to\r\nthe building of the Temple, and the context of this revelation (see\r\nsec. 127) proves that they were in favor with the Lord and had been\r\n_diligent_ and _patient_ and _persevering_ in their works. We have seen\r\ntoo, from the Prophet's own words, that \"laboring with their might\"\r\nmeant _one-tenth_ of their _time_ or _means--a tithing_ of the people,\r\nwhich is all the Lord had asked of them, and this could be redoubled\r\nwithout any thought of lethargy or lack of diligence. There is no\r\nsense in the Reorganite \"defender,\" being unreasonable, technical and\r\npeevish in this matter to win a point for a dilapidated cause. There is\r\nsufficient evidence given in this book; and it is not all that could\r\nbe given by any means, to show that the Saints labored faithfully,\r\ndiligently, and did all that the Lord required of them until they had\r\ncompleted the Temple; and that, too, while they were being harassed,\r\npersecuted, and in every way opposed by their enemies. All these facts\r\nthe \"defender\" very carefully avoids.\r\n\r\nAnother thing. Who was it that failed to be diligent and to labor\r\nwith their mights in building the Temple? Those scattered members who\r\nrefused to go to Nauvoo when commanded, and afterwards,--if we may\r\naccept Reorganite testimony--became the nucleus of their Church! Those\r\nwho fled from Nauvoo with James J. Strang, Sidney Rigdon and William\r\nSmith; forsaking the Church; refusing to assist in the completion of\r\nthe Temple; opposing the building of that edifice; even prophesying\r\nthat it would not be built, and blocking the progress of its erection!\r\nNotwithstanding the Lord declared to Parley P. Pratt in a revelation\r\njust following the martyrdom--which is accepted by the Reorganites as\r\ngenuine--\"Go and say unto _my people_ (not rejected) in Nauvoo, that\r\nthey shall continue to pursue their daily duties and take care of\r\nthemselves, and make no movement in _Church government_ to reorganize\r\nor alter anything until the return of the remainder of the quorum of\r\nthe Twelve (not rejected). _But exhort them that they continue to build\r\nthe House of the Lord which I have commanded them to build in Nauvoo_.\"\r\n(My comments and italics). Autobiography of Parley P. Pratt, page 371).\r\nNotwithstanding this commandment, some forsook Nauvoo and refused to\r\nassist in building the Temple, and these were the ones who afterwards\r\nbecame active members of the \"Reorganization.\" It will take more\r\nevidence than a lot of innuendos, accusations, and downright sophistry\r\nto prove that the Lord rejected those who labored diligently on the\r\nTemple, according to His command, and accepted those who rejected the\r\nTemple, and refused to assist in its erection.\r\n\r\n12. Commenting on this the Reorganite \"defender\" says: \"On page 23 he\r\nquotes from Sidney Rigdon, 'In the _Messenger_ and _Advocate_ for June,\r\n1846;' and on next page (24) he says: 'At that time (June, 1846) the\r\ntemple was not quite finished.' On page 24, not finished in June, and\r\non page 23, finished on May 1st. On which page is he correct?\"\r\n\r\nIf the foregoing criticism was written through ignorance, of course the\r\nwriter may be excused, for one cannot be expected to furnish reasoning\r\npowers to men who lack the capacity to understand a simple fact. But it\r\nappears very forcibly that it is a deliberate prevarication, prepared\r\npurposely to deceive, and thus shall I look upon it, rather than lay it\r\nto his stupidity.\r\n\r\nThere is no contradiction whatever here, for I did not say, as he gives\r\nit: \"At this time (June, 1846) the Temple was not quite finished.\"\r\nThe reference taken from the letter of Sidney Rigdon, appeared in\r\nthe _Messenger_ and _Advocate_ of June, 1846, along with a number of\r\nother articles _written_ in March, April and May, 1846. Any greenhorn,\r\nmuch less a man of wisdom and intelligence, knows that an article\r\nappearing in a monthly magazine is _always written before_ the date\r\nof publication of the magazine, and more was this the case in 1846,\r\nwhen the modern improvements and facilities were not to be had by a\r\nsmall country publication. Now, what I did say--which would have been\r\napparent to his readers had he dared to publish the statement of Sidney\r\nRigdon and my comment which proves the diligence of the Saints _up to_\r\nthe last--was this: \"This article was written just shortly after the\r\nexodus commenced, and at _that time_ (i. e., shortly after the exodus\r\ncommenced) the Temple was not quite finished, but it was finished\r\nbefore all the Saints left Nauvoo.\" (See context). This harmonizes\r\nperfectly with the date of dedication. Moreover, Sidney Rigdon had\r\nnot been at Nauvoo since before the exodus commenced, which was in\r\nFebruary, 1846, not June, and was not prepared to say just what the\r\nSaints did after that time.\r\n\r\n13. In answer to the question, \"when was the Church rejected with\r\nits dead?\" the president of the \"Reorganization\" in an editorial in\r\nthe Saints' Herald, February 17, 1905, said: \"We are not aware that\r\nspecific date or time, or any one specific act has been fixed upon as\r\n_the_ time and _the_ event when and why the Church was rejected.\" He\r\nthen declares that the seed was sown as early as 1843 that finally grew\r\nand culminated in the \"rejection of the Church.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Heman C. Smith quotes Lyman Wight (True Succession, p. 74) as\r\nfollows: \"We were to have sufficient time to build that house,\r\n[Nauvoo Temple] during which time our baptisms for our dead should be\r\nacceptable in the river. If we did not build within this time we were\r\nto be rejected as a church, we and our dead together. Both the Temple\r\nand baptizing went very leisurely, till the Temple was somewhere in\r\nbuilding the second story, when Brother Joseph from the stand announced\r\nthe alarming declaration that baptism for the dead was no longer\r\nacceptable in the river. As much to say the time for building the\r\nTemple had passed by, and both we and our dead were rejected together.\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n\"The Church now stands rejected together with their dead. The Church\r\nbeing rejected now stands alienated from her God in every sense of the\r\nword.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Heman C. Smith accepts this statement saying: \"What but blind\r\nambition to rule prevented others of the signers [Apostles] from\r\nrecognizing the consequence so apparent?\"\r\n\r\nThis was written by Lyman Wight in _1851_ and was an _afterthought_ on\r\nhis part, for he continued to work in the ministry until the death of\r\nJoseph and Hyrum Smith, without one intimation by word or deed that\r\nthe Church had been rejected in 1841. Moreover, if the Saints could\r\nget the structure of a building that cost a million dollars \"somewhere\r\nin building the second story\" in that time of distress and trouble,\r\nwithin _about six months_ they could not possibly have worked _very\r\nleisurely_, and the Prophet in 1842 praised them for their diligence\r\nand zeal. (See page 38).\r\n\r\nAnother Reorganite writer (A. M. Chase) in the Saints' Herald for June\r\n20, 1906, declares that the Church was rejected in 1841: \"When this\r\nappointment was ended by revelation, October 3, 1841, and the temple\r\nnot completed, then all Israel should have known they were 'rejected as\r\na church' with their dead.\"\r\n\r\nIt is quite evident that the sufficient time was up on this date, for\r\nthey were to have the privilege to baptize in the river \"while the time\r\nwas passing\" and this privilege of baptizing in the river terminated,\r\nOctober 3, 1841, thus proving that the time had come for baptisms in\r\nthe Temple. It was not _finished_ and the revelation did not call for\r\nit to be _finished_, and at this time it was _built_ sufficiently for\r\nthis ordinance to be attended to in the font in the proper way. For\r\nthat reason the Lord transferred the ordinance of baptism for the\r\ndead from the river to the font of the Lord's House. That he had not\r\nrejected the Church is evident from this very commandment, for in it\r\nthe Lord tells them to baptize in the font in the Temple, which He\r\nwould not have done had they been rejected. If He had rejected them He\r\nwould have stated so positively in a revelation to the Prophet, for\r\nhe received several revelations _after_ this event and some of them\r\nwere concerning baptism for the dead and temple work. (See sections\r\n127 and 128). This commandment given to the Church in 1841 and other\r\nrevelations subsequently, prove conclusively that the Lord would and\r\ndid accept of the work for the dead in the Temple, without it being\r\n\"completely finished,\" after the privilege to baptize in the river had\r\nexpired. The thing for which they were to be rejected was the failure\r\nto perform these ordinances, _after the expiration of river baptisms_,\r\nand the Saints did not fail to perform the ordinances in the Temple.\r\n\r\n14. The Reorganite \"defender\" at this point carefully avoids the\r\nevidence and argument presented here, and argues at great length\r\nattempting to prove that the Church was rejected because the Lord\r\nsaid He was \"_about_ to restore many things to the earth pertaining\r\nto the Priesthood.\" The Lord said: \"I deign to reveal unto _My\r\nChurch_, things which have been kept hid from before the foundation\r\nof the world, things that pertain to the dispensation of the fulnesss\r\nof times.\" The \"defender\" says these things were not revealed, nor\r\nrestored to the Church; that no revelations that were kept hid from\r\nbefore the foundation of the world, pertaining to the Priesthood in the\r\ndispensation of the fulnesss of times, have been revealed from heaven;\r\ntherefore the Church was rejected with its dead. He says their Doctrine\r\nand Covenants contains no such revelations; that no such revelations\r\nare to be found in our edition of the Doctrine and Covenants; and,\r\ntherefore, he concludes, no such revelations have been given to us, or\r\nthe Church; so the Church must have been rejected.\r\n\r\nHe asks me to answer the following questions: \"Now let us ask, Mr.\r\nSmith: Have any such revelations been received? Name them. Where are\r\nthey and what are they?\"\r\n\r\nI have taken this matter up under the head of \"Temple Building and\r\nCeremonial Endowments Therein.\" All that is necessary to say here is\r\nthis: If the Lord kept things hid from the world since before the\r\nfoundation thereof was laid and now has revealed them to His people,\r\nthey are not intended for the world and necessarily will not be\r\nfound in the written word. Such revelations have been revealed unto\r\nthe Church in the Temples of the Lord; but I shall _not_ name them.\r\nIf the Lord saw fit to keep them from the world, yes, and from the\r\ndispensations past, He does not intend to reveal them to the world\r\n_now_; neither to the scoffer and the unbeliever in His works. Let our\r\nfriend read Matthew 7:10-12, as it is given in the Holy Scriptures:\r\n\"_And the mysteries of the kingdom ye shall keep within yourselves_;\r\nfor it is not meet to give that which is holy unto the dogs; neither\r\ncast ye your pearls unto swine, lest they trample them under their\r\nfeet. For the world cannot receive that which ye, yourselves, are not\r\nable to bear; wherefore ye shall not give your pearls unto them, lest\r\nthey turn again and rend you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSuccession in the Presidency of the Church.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nAn Address Delivered in the Weber Stake Tabernacle, Ogden, Sunday,\r\nApril 28, 1907, by Elder Joseph F. Smith, Jr.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nA short time ago I was invited to address the Saints from this stand\r\non the subject of \"The Origin of the Reorganized Church.\" It has been\r\nthought by some that it would be wise to continue the subject and\r\ntherefore I have been invited to address you this afternoon on the\r\nquestion of Succession in the Presidency of the Church. In doing so, I\r\ndesire it to be understood that I have no feeling of animosity towards\r\nthose of a different faith; but so much has been said on the other\r\nside of this question, and so little in our defense, that I feel it\r\nimportant to deal with this subject.\r\n\r\nThe testimony on which members of the so-called \"Reorganized\" Church\r\nbase their contention that Joseph, son of the Prophet Joseph Smith,\r\nshould have succeeded his father in the Presidency of the Church is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n1. That it is his right by the law of lineage--that the office of\r\npresident of the High Priesthood descends from father to the first born\r\nson.\r\n\r\n2. That it is his right by appointment of his father.\r\n\r\n3. That he was properly ordained by those holding the authority to\r\npreach and administer in the ordinances of the gospel.\r\n\r\nWe shall take these questions up and consider them and will refer to\r\nthe passages in the Doctrine and Covenants that are used by these\r\npeople, together with other passages that they do not use, and we will\r\nsee just how much there is in them in support of their position.\r\n\r\nWe will first consider the statement that the Prophet was to choose\r\nhis successor. The passages referred to in support of this are in\r\nthe Doctrine and Covenants as follows: Sections 28:6-7, 35:18, and\r\n43:2-5. These I shall read to you. I cannot stop now to explain the\r\ncircumstances under which these revelations were given, and take it for\r\ngranted that you will consider that matter for yourselves. The first of\r\nthese was given to Oliver Cowdery and I read, beginning with the 4th\r\nverse:\r\n\r\n    \"And if thou art led at any time by the Comforter, to speak or\r\n    teach, or at all times by the way of commandment unto the Church,\r\n    thou mayest do it. But thou shalt not write by way of commandment,\r\n    but by wisdom; and thou shalt not command him who is at thy head,\r\n    and at the head of the Church, for I have given him the keys of\r\n    the mysteries, and the revelations which are sealed, until I shall\r\n    appoint unto them another in his stead.\"\r\n\r\nYou see, the Lord was to appoint another.\r\n\r\nThe passage in section 35 is as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"And I have sent forth the fulnesss of my Gospel by the hand of\r\n    my servant Joseph; and in weakness have I blessed him, and I have\r\n    given unto him the keys of the mystery of those things which have\r\n    been sealed, even things which were from the foundation of the\r\n    world, and the things which shall come from this time until the\r\n    time of my coming, IF HE ABIDE IN ME, AND IF NOT, ANOTHER WILL I\r\n    PLANT IN HIS STEAD. Wherefore, watch over him that his faith fail\r\n    not, and it shall be given by the Comforter, the Holy Ghost, that\r\n    knoweth all things.\"\r\n\r\nThe third passage is as follows, beginning with the first verse:\r\n\r\n    \"O hearken, ye Elders of my Church, and give an ear to the word\r\n    which I shall speak unto you; for behold verily, verily, I say unto\r\n    you, that ye have received a commandment for a law unto my Church,\r\n    through him whom I have appointed unto you, to receive commandments\r\n    and revelations from my hand.\r\n\r\n    \"And this ye shall know assuredly that there is none other\r\n    appointed unto you to receive commandments and revelations until\r\n    he be taken, if he abide in me. But verily, verily, I say unto\r\n    you, that none else shall be appointed unto this gift except it be\r\n    through him, FOR IF IT BE TAKEN FROM HIM, he shall not have power\r\n    except to appoint another in his stead; and this shall be a law\r\n    unto you, that ye receive not the teachings of any that shall come\r\n    before you as revelations or commandments; and this I give unto you\r\n    that you may not be deceived, that you may know they are not of me.\"\r\n\r\nThese revelations, extracts from which I have read, were all given\r\nbetween September, 1830, and the first of March, 1831. At that time\r\nthe Church was less than one year old, and was not fully organized\r\nwith its various officers as we have it today. The quorums of Apostles\r\nand Seventies were not called till 1835--over four years subsequent to\r\nthese revelations. When they were given the Prophet Joseph was young\r\nand inexperienced, and this law was laid down for the government of\r\nthe Church as it existed at that time, as these revelations clearly\r\nindicate. You will notice from these passages, that the Lord was to\r\nchoose another in the Prophet's stead in case of his removal through\r\ntransgression, or for any other cause, during that incipient stage of\r\nthe history of the Church. It was necessary at that time that some\r\nprovision be made for the perpetuity of the prophetic office, in case\r\nthat Joseph Smith should not prove faithful to the great trust in\r\nthe days of his preparation and qualification, and before he became\r\nthoroughly seasoned and fitted for this important calling. In such an\r\nemergency the power of necessity must have been conferred by Joseph\r\nSmith on his successor, for he held the keys; therefore, the Lord\r\ndeclared that in case of the prophet's transgression or removal, he\r\nwould still retain the power in that case to ordain his successor and\r\nto confer upon such successor, whom the Lord was to choose, the keys\r\nand authority that had been conferred upon him.\r\n\r\nIt must also be remembered that the Prophet Joseph, like the prophets\r\nof old and even the Savior Himself, had to continue from grace to grace\r\nand \"increase in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God,\" and with\r\nhim, as with the Master, \"he received not a fulnesss at first;\" but\r\nthrough trials, tribulations, and varied experiences, had to prove\r\nhis worthiness before God in order that he might hold the keys of the\r\nkingdom. It was during this period of preparation that the expression\r\nin the revelations quoted were given regarding the appointment of\r\na successor; but later the Lord revealed more of His will, and the\r\nChurch was established with all the proper officers and quorums for\r\nits guidance and perpetuity, when death should remove its President.\r\nMoreover, while in these revelations the Lord prepared the means of\r\na successor in case of the transgression or removal of Joseph Smith,\r\nlater when he had proved himself and evinced before God through his\r\nfaithfulness that he was worthy of the trust placed in him, the Lord\r\ndeclared that the keys of the kingdom should never be taken from him in\r\nthe following words:\r\n\r\n    \"Thus saith the Lord, verily, verily, I say unto you my son,\r\n    thy sins are forgiven thee according to thy petition, for thy\r\n    prayers and the prayers of thy brethren have come up into my ears;\r\n    Therefore thou art blessed from henceforth that bear the keys of\r\n    the kingdom given unto you; which kingdom is coming forth for the\r\n    last time.\r\n\r\n    \"Verily I say unto you, the keys of this kingdom shall NEVER be\r\n    taken from you, while thou art in the world, neither in the world\r\n    to come; nevertheless, through you shall the oracles be given to\r\n    another, yea, even unto the CHURCH.\"\r\n\r\nI take it as a natural sequence that this law which was given in March,\r\n1833, superseded the provision made in 1830 and winter of 1831, wherein\r\na law was given as a protection to the Church in case of the taking\r\naway of the keys from Joseph the Prophet--a contingency that did not\r\narise.[1] Later in the year 1835, when the Twelve Apostles were chosen\r\nand their duties defined, the Lord declared that they were equal with\r\nthe Presidency as a quorum. That is, in case of the dissolution or\r\ndestruction of the First Presidency of the Church, the Twelve should\r\nsucceed to the presidency, and would thus act until such time and\r\nplace as the Lord revealed that the First Presidency should be again\r\norganized. And whenever the First Presidency should be disorganized it\r\nwould devolve upon the Apostles' quorum to set in order and direct the\r\naffairs of the Church. I quote from the one hundred and seventh section.\r\n\r\n    \"And they (that is the Twelve) form a quorum, equal in authority\r\n    and power to the three Presidents previously mentioned.\r\n\r\n    \"The Seventy are also called to preach the Gospel and to be\r\n    especial witnesses unto the Gentiles and in all the world. Thus\r\n    differing from other officers in the Church in the duties of their\r\n    calling.\r\n\r\n    \"And they form a quorum equal in authority to that of the Twelve\r\n    special witnesses or Apostles just named.\"\r\n\r\nThat is to say: that when the First Presidency is disorganized, the\r\nTwelve Apostles become the presiding quorum of the Church until the\r\npresidency is again organized, and during that time they are virtually\r\nthe Presidency of the Church--the presiding quorum. If through some\r\ncause--which is not likely to arise--both these quorums should be\r\ndestroyed then it would devolve on the Seventies to set in order the\r\nChurch and they would become the presiding quorum. This is the law that\r\nGod has revealed, and it is the only law and order of the Priesthood\r\nthat He has revealed for the guidance of the Church in succession. You\r\nmay search the Doctrine and Covenants from beginning to end and will\r\nfind no other law of succession.\r\n\r\nI think it must be conceded that the Apostles could not be equal in\r\nauthority with the Presidency when the First Presidency is fully and\r\nproperly organized. There could not be two heads--or three heads--of\r\nequal authority at the same time, for such a thing would lead to\r\nconfusion. Hence the Apostles are equal, as has been stated in that\r\nthey have power to assume control of the affairs of the Church when the\r\nPresidency is dissolved by the death of the President. This idea was\r\nclearly in the mind of the Prophet when on the 16th day of January,\r\n1836, in a special council of the Presidency and the Twelve, he\r\nsaid--This is in the History of the Church, vol. 2, page 374; also the\r\n'Reorganite' history, vol. 2, pages 11-12:\r\n\r\n    \"I next proceeded to explain the duty of the Twelve, and their\r\n    authority, which is next to the present Presidency, and that the\r\n    arrangement of the assembly in this place on the 15th instant,\r\n    in placing the High Council of Kirtland next the Presidency, was\r\n    because the business to be transacted was business relating to\r\n    that body in particular, which was to fill the several quorums\r\n    in Kirtland, not because they were first in office, and that the\r\n    arrangements were the most judicious that could be made on the\r\n    occasion; also the Twelve are not subject to any other than the\r\n    First Presidency; viz., myself, Sidney Rigdon, and Frederick G.\r\n    Williams, who are now my counselors; and where I am not, there is\r\n    no First Presidency over the Twelve.\"\r\n\r\nIf in such a case, there is no First Presidency over the Twelve, then\r\nthe Twelve must be the presiding quorum of the Church when the First\r\nPresidency is disorganized. Again, at a special conference of the\r\nChurch held August 16, 1841, we are informed in the minutes that the\r\nProphet addressed the Saints as follows--(T. S., 2. 521.):\r\n\r\n    \"President Joseph Smith now arriving proceeded to state to the\r\n    conference at considerable length, the object of their present\r\n    meeting, and in addition to what President Young had stated in the\r\n    morning, said that the time had come when the Twelve should be\r\n    called upon to stand in their place next to the First Presidency,\r\n    and attend to the settling of emigrants and the business of the\r\n    Church at the stakes and assist to bear off the kingdom victorious\r\n    to the nations; and as they had been faithful and had borne the\r\n    burden in the heat of the day that it was right that they should\r\n    have an opportunity of providing something for themselves and\r\n    families, and at the same time relieve him so that he might attend\r\n    to the business of translating.\r\n\r\n    \"Motioned, seconded and carried, that the conference approve of the\r\n    instructions of President Smith, in relation to the Twelve, and\r\n    that they proceed accordingly, to attend to the duties of their\r\n    office.\"\r\n\r\nTherefore it was by right of divine appointment that the Apostles'\r\nquorum became the presiding quorum of the Church at the death of the\r\nProphet Joseph Smith.\r\n\r\n\r\nLINEAGE.\r\n\r\nWe will now consider this \"law of lineage.\" From section 86, they quote\r\nto us as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"Therefore, thus saith the Lord unto you with whom the Priesthood\r\n    hath continued through the lineage of your fathers, for ye are\r\n    lawful heirs, according to the flesh, and have been hid from the\r\n    world with Christ in God; therefore your life and the Priesthood\r\n    hath remained and must needs remain through you and your lineage,\r\n    until the restoration of all things spoken by the mouths of all the\r\n    holy prophets since the world began.\"\r\n\r\nBut they fail to quote the eleventh and succeeding verse:\r\n\r\n    \"Therefore, blessed are ye if ye continue in my goodness, a light\r\n    unto the gentiles, and through the Priesthood, a savior unto my\r\n    people Israel. The Lord hath said it, Amen.\"\r\n\r\nBut to whom was this revelation given? Was it to the Prophet Joseph\r\nSmith alone? Is this a promise that his seed shall inherit the\r\nPriesthood? Certainly not. This revelation was given December 6,\r\n1832, to the Elders of the Church. Therefore, when members of the\r\n\"Reorganization\" declare that Joseph Smith was one of these Elders\r\nand must be included with his posterity in the promise, we meet their\r\nargument with the counter statement, that the promise was also to Hyrum\r\nSmith, to Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, George A. Smith, Parley P.\r\nPratt, Orson Pratt, and a large number of other Elders who never have\r\nbeen identified with the \"Reorganization,\" nor have their children, and\r\nto them this promise is as sure as to the seed of any others. We must\r\nnot lose sight of the fact that no man can lay claim to salvation, nor\r\nto the Priesthood of God, simply because he had a faithful father. The\r\ninference in this eleventh verse is, that if they are not faithful,\r\nthen they will not receive the fulfilment of the promise. The posterity\r\nof Joseph Smith, like the posterity of any other Elder of Israel, will\r\nstand or fall on their own foundation which they have builded. And if\r\nthe sons of Joseph Smith refuse to keep the commandments, the blessings\r\nwill pass them by; but God's work will continue until the consummation\r\nof all things.\r\n\r\nAgain they quote from section 112 as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"For verily I say unto you, the keys of the dispensation which ye\r\n    have received, have come down from the fathers; and last of all\r\n    being sent down from heaven unto you.\"\r\n\r\nThis revelation was given to Thomas B. Marsh and the Apostles in July,\r\n1837; and while it is true that the Priesthood which these men held\r\ndid come down from the fathers, it was not from father to son, from\r\ngeneration to generation, in the flesh. For the Priesthood, as we\r\nknow, was conferred on the heads of Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery\r\nby Peter, James and John. Joseph Smith's grandfather did not hold the\r\nPriesthood nor his fathers before him for generations upon generations.\r\nSo we must look at this in a broader sense than our friends are willing\r\nthat we should do. What is meant by the Priesthood coming down from\r\nthe fathers, and that it must needs remain through the lineage of the\r\nElders of the Church? It means simply this, that the Priesthood has\r\ncome down from those who held it in ancient days and has been conferred\r\nupon men in this day according to promise, because they are of the seed\r\nof Joseph of the tribe of Ephraim. For the Lord promised to bless the\r\nchildren of Ephraim in the latter days with His power. And when the\r\nChurch was established it was with the promise that it was never again\r\nto be destroyed; therefore, it must needs be that the Priesthood remain\r\nthrough the lineage of the Elders of the Church. But it will be through\r\nthose who are faithful, and not the unfaithful sons, and there is not\r\none word in these passages that declares that the Presidency of the\r\nHigh Priesthood descends from father to son, and that it is the right\r\nof the son of Joseph Smith to succeed his father. Not one word!\r\n\r\nThey also quote section 110; to the effect that the generations were\r\nto be blessed through the seed of Joseph Smith. That passage is from a\r\nvision received by Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, April 3, 1836, when\r\nthey received the keys of various dispensations, and is as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"After this, Elias appeared, and committed the dispensation of\r\n    the Gospel of Abraham, saying, that in us, and our seed, all\r\n    generations after us should be blessed.\"\r\n\r\nTherefore they say that unless the sons of the Prophet Joseph Smith\r\nwere in the true Church and held the Priesthood, this promise would\r\nfail. Not so, however. As I have said, if those sons are not faithful\r\nthe realization of the promise will pass them by until some of the seed\r\nof Joseph Smith will stand up to receive the blessing. Furthermore,\r\nthis promise was not made solely to Joseph Smith. Oliver Cowdery\r\nreceived the same blessing; but he left the Church and went into\r\nforbidden paths, and the promised blessing was taken from him and given\r\nto another. So it will be with the sons of Joseph the Prophet; if they\r\nrepent not they shall not receive the blessing. The Lord has declared:\r\n\r\n    \"Who am I, saith the Lord, that have promised and have not\r\n    fulfilled? I command and a man obeys not, I revoke and they receive\r\n    not the blessing.\"\r\n\r\nI stated that this blessing that was given to Oliver Cowdery was taken\r\nfrom him and given to another. In the Doctrine and Covenants, section\r\n124:94-95, this is found:\r\n\r\n    \"And from this time forth I appoint unto him (that is Hyrum Smith)\r\n    that he may be a prophet, and a seer, and a revelator unto my\r\n    Church, as well as my servant Joseph.\r\n\r\n    \"That he may act in concert also with my servant Joseph, and that\r\n    he shall receive counsel from my servant Joseph, who shall show\r\n    unto him the keys whereby he may ask and receive, and be crowned\r\n    with the same blessing, and glory, and honor, and Priesthood, and\r\n    gifts of the Priesthood, that once were put upon him that was my\r\n    servant Oliver Cowdery.\"\r\n\r\nHere the blessings of Oliver Cowdery are transferred to the head\r\nof Hyrum Smith, and, therefore, we can say with equal emphasis\r\nthat in the seed of Hyrum Smith, as well as in the seed of Joseph\r\nSmith, all generations after him shall be blessed. For the Lord hath\r\nspoken it! Now, the seed of Hyrum Smith are not connected with the\r\n\"Reorganization.\" However, in the words of another let me say:\r\n\r\n    \"That the descendants of Joseph Smith, and those of Hyrum Smith,\r\n    stand before God as do all other men, assured of honor or dishonor,\r\n    exaltation or degradation, according to their individual works.\"\r\n\r\nWe are also referred to verses 56-58 of section 124, which, perhaps, is\r\na passage on which they lay the greatest stress of all. I shall read\r\nbeginning with the fifty-sixth verse, and ask you to follow me closely\r\nand I will read it as clearly as I possibly can:\r\n\r\n    \"And now I say unto you, as pertaining to my boarding house which I\r\n    have commanded you to build for the boarding of strangers, let it\r\n    be built unto my name, and let my name be named upon it, and let my\r\n    servant Joseph, and his house have place therein, from generation\r\n    to generation;\r\n\r\n    \"For this anointing have I put upon his head, that his blessing\r\n    shall also be put upon the head of his posterity after him.\r\n\r\n    \"And as I said unto Abraham concerning the kindreds of the earth,\r\n    even so I say unto my servant Joseph, in thee and in thy seed shall\r\n    the kindred of the earth be blessed.\"\r\n\r\nYou see it says, \"this anointing have I put upon his head.\" What\r\nanointing does this refer to? Notice that it says, \"as pertaining to\r\nmy boarding house * * let my servant Joseph, and his house have place\r\ntherein, from generation to generation.\" That is the anointing the\r\nterm \"this\" refers to. It is the place in that boarding house, and has\r\nnothing to do with the Presidency of the Church. I have already shown\r\nto you that in the seed of Hyrum Smith as well as in the seed of Joseph\r\nSmith the generations after them were to be blessed; there is nothing\r\nin this promise indicating that the posterity of either of them shall\r\nhave right to the Presidency of the Church.\r\n\r\nBut they say this blessing does not refer to the boarding house in\r\nwhich the Prophet Joseph paid stock for himself and generations after\r\nhim; but that it refers to the blessing of his progenitors; that\r\nis, to the birthright which was given to Joseph--the right of the\r\nprimogeniture. And considering this passage Heman C. Smith, in his\r\n\"True Succession,\" has the following to say:\r\n\r\n    \"Here then is the blessing given to Joseph to occupy in this\r\n    position, and to discharge these duties and responsibilities. But\r\n    some one objects that this is not called a 'blessing;' but is it\r\n    not a blessing? However, to silence this caviling, we refer the\r\n    reader to the blessing of Joseph Smith as pronounced by his father\r\n    on the occasion of the ordination of the High Council. February 19,\r\n    1834, Joseph in his history says:\r\n\r\n    \"'My father Joseph then laid his hands upon my head and said,\r\n    \"Joseph, I lay my hands upon thy head and pronounce the blessings\r\n    of thy progenitors upon thee, that thou mayest hold the keys of the\r\n    mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, until the coming of the Lord.\r\n    Amen.'\" (True Succession, p. 44).\r\n\r\nThen he goes on to say that this is the blessing referred to in the\r\nrevelation I have just quoted from, and that it was the blessing of the\r\nprimogeniture. The birthright of the first born. But Mr. Heman C. Smith\r\nis too hasty. Invariably in quoting this blessing given to the Prophet\r\nby his father and which is found in the Times and Seasons, volume 6,\r\npages 994-5, they tactfully refrain from quoting what immediately\r\nfollows. I will quote it from the Times and Seasons:\r\n\r\n    \"He also laid his hands upon the head of his son Samuel and said,\r\n    'Samuel, I lay my hands upon thy head, and pronounce the blessing\r\n    of thy progenitors upon thee, that thou mayest remain a Priest of\r\n    the Most High God, and like Samuel of old, hear His voice, saying,\r\n    Samuel, Samuel. Amen.'\r\n\r\n    \"John Johnson also, laid his hands upon the head of his son Luke\r\n    and said, 'My Father in heaven, I ask thee to bless this my son,\r\n    according to the blessings of his forefathers, that he may be\r\n    strengthened in his ministry, according to his holy calling. Amen.'\"\r\n\r\nThis proves to us that the blessing of the progenitors was not\r\nnecessarily the blessing of the first born; nor was it the right to\r\nthe Presidency of the Church; for Samuel received a blessing similar\r\nto that of his brother Joseph, and neither of them received the\r\nbirthright in these blessings. I shall now show you that it was Hyrum\r\nSmith who received the blessing of the first born--the birthright--and\r\nit was not the Presidency of the Church either, for they are not the\r\nsame. However, before I show this I want to read a paragraph from the\r\nhistory published by the \"Reorganized\" Church. This is volume 2, and\r\nis \"written and compiled\" by Joseph Smith and his assistant, Heman C.\r\nSmith, their historian. On pages 462-3 they give the dying blessings\r\npronounced by Patriarch Joseph Smith on the heads of his children. They\r\nintroduce this account in the following words:\r\n\r\n    \"In connection with the fact that Joseph's and William's children\r\n    are identified with the Reorganization, while Hyrum's and Samuel's\r\n    are in Utah, it is interesting to note that the children of the two\r\n    former were to be blessed after them, while the children of the two\r\n    latter are not mentioned.\r\n\r\n    \"The account of this deathbed scene and the blessings, as given by\r\n    Lucy Smith, the mother of the Prophet and widow of the Patriarch,\r\n    is as follows:\"\r\n\r\nHere is the blessing of Hyrum Smith:\r\n\r\n    \"My son Hyrum, I seal upon your head your patriarchal blessing,\r\n    which I placed upon your head before, for that shall be verified.\r\n    In addition to this, I now give you my dying blessing, You shall\r\n    have a season of peace, so that you shall have sufficient rest to\r\n    accomplish the work which God has given you to do. You shall be\r\n    as firm as the pillars of heaven unto the end of your days. I NOW\r\n    SEAL UPON YOUR HEAD THE PATRIARCHAL POWER, and you shall bless the\r\n    people. This is my dying blessing upon your head in the name of\r\n    Jesus. Amen.\"\r\n\r\nThere is the birthright!\r\n\r\nAnd now Joseph's blessing:\r\n\r\n    \"Joseph, my son, you are called to a high and holy calling. You\r\n    are even called to do the work of the Lord. Hold out faithful and\r\n    you shall be blessed and your children after you. You shall even\r\n    live to finish your work. At this Joseph cried out, weeping, 'Oh!\r\n    my father, shall I?' 'Yes,' said his father, 'you shall live to\r\n    lay out the plan of all the work which God has given you to do.\r\n    This is my dying blessing on your head, in the name of Jesus. I\r\n    also confirm your former blessing upon your head; for it shall be\r\n    fulfilled. Even so. Amen.\"\r\n\r\nOn first thought it is a little strange that the children of Joseph\r\nthe Prophet are to be blessed after him, while that promise is not\r\nin the blessing of Hyrum Smith. However, let us examine the blessing\r\ngiven to Hyrum Smith a little more closely. The first sentence reads:\r\n\"My son Hyrum, I seal upon your head your patriarchal blessing, which\r\nI placed upon your head before, _for that shall be verified_. And what\r\nfollowed was in addition to that former blessing so there was no need\r\nof repeating what that former blessing contained; but it was to be\r\nverified. I have before me that former blessing. This is a patriarchal\r\nblessing given by Patriarch Joseph Smith on the head of his son Hyrum,\r\nDecember 9, 1834, in Kirtland, Ohio, and is recorded in Patriarch\r\nJoseph Smith's book of blessings on pages 1 and 2, and is in the\r\nhandwriting of Oliver Cowdery. Here is a portion of it:\r\n\r\n    \"Hyrum, thou art my oldest son whom the Lord has spared unto me.\r\n    * * * * Behold thou art Hyrum, the Lord hath called thee by that\r\n    name, and by that name He has blessed thee. Thou hast borne the\r\n    burden and the heat of the day, thou hast toiled hard and labored\r\n    much for the good of thy father's family; thou hast been a stay\r\n    many times to them, and by thy diligence they have often been\r\n    sustained. Thou hast loved thy father's family with a pure love,\r\n    and hast greatly desired their salvation. Thou hast always stood by\r\n    thy father, and reached forth the helping hand to lift him up when\r\n    he was in affliction, and though he has been out of the way, thou\r\n    hast never forsaken him nor laughed him to scorn; for all these\r\n    kindnesses the Lord my God will bless thee.\"\r\n\r\nI promised that I would prove to you that when the Patriarch blessed\r\nJoseph, his son, with the blessing of his progenitors, that it was not\r\nthe birthright, but that that blessing was reserved for Hyrum. Here is\r\nthe proof, or at least a portion of it. The blessing continues:\r\n\r\n    \"I now ask my Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ, to\r\n    BLESS THEE with the SAME BLESSING with which Jacob blessed his son\r\n    Joseph, for thou art his true descendant, and thy posterity shall\r\n    be numbered with the house of Ephraim, and with them thou shalt\r\n    stand up to crown the tribes of Israel; when they come shouting to\r\n    Zion. * * * *\r\n\r\n    \"The Lord will multiply his choice blessings upon thee and thy\r\n    seed after thee and thou with them shall have an inheritance in\r\n    Zion, and they shall possess it from generation to generation, and\r\n    thy name shall never be blotted out from among the just, for the\r\n    righteous shall rise up, and also thy children after thee, and say\r\n    thy memory is just, that thou wert a just man and perfect in thy\r\n    day.\"\r\n\r\nWe see that Hyrum was blessed with the blessing of Joseph, and we learn\r\nfrom the fifth chapter of I Chronicles that through the transgression\r\nof Reuben, Joseph received the birthright, and he got it from his\r\nfather Jacob. In the second verse we read:\r\n\r\n    \"For Judah prevailed above his brethren, and of him came the chief\r\n    ruler; but the birthright was Joseph's.\"\r\n\r\nBefore we leave this chapter in Chronicles let me state that if Joseph\r\nreceived the birthright, and if the birthright and the Presidency of\r\nthe Church were inseparable, then it should have been through Joseph\r\nthat the Messiah should have come; but we learn that Judah prevailed\r\nabove his brethren in this particular.\r\n\r\nSo you see Hyrum was blessed with Joseph's blessing, and in his dying\r\nblessing his father declared that it should be verified! I maintain\r\nthat the birthright therefore was not the blessing of his progenitors\r\nthat was given to Joseph, neither to Samuel Smith.\r\n\r\nOur friends have solemnly informed us there was \"no blessing to the\r\nchildren of Hyrum Smith.\" I desire to call your attention to a few\r\nexpressions in the blessing which I have just read. The promise is\r\nhere given that the posterity of Hyrum Smith shall be numbered with\r\nthe house of Ephraim and shall stand up with their father to crown the\r\ntribes of Israel when they come shouting to Zion. Now, how can they\r\ncrown the tribes of Israel unless they hold the Priesthood and are\r\nfaithful men? Again, the promise is made to them that they shall have\r\nan inheritance in Zion and possess it from generation to generation,\r\nand their names never were to be blotted out. Now, how could this be\r\nunless they were members of the Church holding the Priesthood? For\r\nthe faithless and unbelieving and the apostate was not to be numbered\r\nin Zion, but his name was to be blotted out. I think you will agree\r\nwith me that these gentlemen in their preface to these blessings spoke\r\nrather hastily of the children of Hyrum Smith.\r\n\r\nI have here another blessing. This was given by the Prophet Joseph to\r\nhis brother Hyrum December 18, 1833, at Kirtland, and is also recorded\r\nin the handwriting of Oliver Cowdery and is on file in the Historian's\r\noffice, Salt Lake City. This blessing shows to us that the Prophet\r\nJoseph Smith recognized the fact that his brother Hyrum had received\r\nthe birthright. He says:\r\n\r\n    \"Blessed of the Lord is my brother Hyrum, for the integrity of his\r\n    heart; he shall be girt about with strength, and faithfulness shall\r\n    be the strength of his loins; from generation to generation he\r\n    shall be a shaft in the hands of his God to execute judgment upon\r\n    His enemies.\"\r\n\r\nI will pause here. We are told that faithfulness shall be the strength\r\nof his loins. This is a figure. We all understand what it means. It\r\nmeans that the children of Hyrum Smith shall be faithful and from\r\ngeneration to generation shall be a shaft in the hands of God to\r\nexecute His judgments. That is what it means!\r\n\r\nBut the blessing continues:\r\n\r\n    \"And he shall be hid by the hand of the Lord, that none of his\r\n    secret parts shall be discovered unto his enemies unto his hurt.\r\n    * * * He shall stand in the tracks of his father, and be numbered\r\n    among those who hold the right of Patriarchal Priesthood, even the\r\n    Evangelical Priesthood and power shall be upon him. His children\r\n    shall be many and his posterity numerous, and they shall rise up\r\n    and call him blessed.\"\r\n\r\nHere we have the Prophet acknowledging that his brother Hyrum should\r\nreceive the birthright, for it was the right of Patriarchal Priesthood,\r\neven the Evangelical Priesthood that was conferred upon the first born,\r\nand not the office of President of the Church.\r\n\r\nWe learn from the Doctrine and Covenants that there are two offices\r\nin the Church that descend from father to son. One is that of the\r\nBishopric, for upon Aaron and his sons the Lord conferred this\r\nPriesthood (section 68:16-18). The other is that of the Evangelist.\r\nThis we learn in section 107, but our friends misconstrue this section\r\nand try to make it appear that it is the Melchizedek Priesthood that is\r\nmeant.[2]\r\n\r\nI will read it and you may judge for yourselves:\r\n\r\n    \"It is the duty of the Twelve, in all large branches of the Church\r\n    to ordain Evangelical ministers, as they shall be designated unto\r\n    them by revelation.\r\n\r\n    \"The order of this Priesthood was confirmed to be handed down from\r\n    father to son, and rightly belongs to the literal descendants of\r\n    the chosen seed, to whom the promises were made.\r\n\r\n    \"This order was instituted in the days of Adam, and came down by\r\n    lineage in the following manner,\" etc.\r\n\r\nNow, Hyrum Smith obtained this birthright from his father. The Prophet\r\nJoseph Smith declared in his blessing upon the head of his brother\r\nHyrum that it was his right to walk in the footsteps of his father.\r\nLet's see what the Lord says about this: In section 124, verse 91, we\r\nread:\r\n\r\n    \"And again, verily I say unto you, let my servant William (Law) be\r\n    appointed, ordained, and anointed, as a counselor unto my servant\r\n    Joseph in the room of my servant Hyrum, that my servant Hyrum may\r\n    take the office of Priesthood and Patriarch, which was appointed\r\n    unto him by his father, by blessing and also BY RIGHT!\"\r\n\r\nThe fact that the Lord has made two exceptions in the order of the\r\nPriesthood, and has so plainly indicated them proves beyond the need of\r\ncontroversy that the other offices do not so descend, for if they did,\r\nthe Lord would not make special mention of these two. Another thing,\r\nif the first born son was to receive the office of Patriarch, that is\r\nsufficient proof that the Presidency of the High Priesthood did not\r\nso descend, for if it did one man must of necessity hold them both.\r\nAgain we learn that this evangelical order came down from father to son\r\nand was instituted in the days of Adam. Let us see if the office of\r\npresident has come down in that manner.\r\n\r\nReorganites sometimes quote to us the following from section 81, but\r\nfor the life of me I do not understand why, since it destroys their\r\nposition:\r\n\r\n    \"Verily, verily I say unto you my servant Frederick G. Williams\r\n    listen to the voice of him who speaketh, to the word of the Lord,\r\n    your God; and hearken to the calling wherewith you are called, even\r\n    to be a High Priest in my Church, and a counselor unto my servant\r\n    Joseph Smith, Jun.\r\n\r\n    \"Unto whom I have given the keys of the kingdom, which belongeth\r\n    always unto the Presidency of the High Priesthood.\"\r\n\r\nIf the keys of the kingdom belongeth always to the Presidency of the\r\nHigh Priesthood, then Peter was President of the High Priesthood for\r\nthe Lord conferred upon him the keys of the kingdom (Matt. 16:19), and\r\nhe conferred them upon Joseph Smith (Doc. & Cov. 27 and 128 sections)\r\neven when we go back in ancient Israel we find Moses of the tribe of\r\nLevi ordaining Joshua the son of Nun as his successor,[3] and not\r\nhis own son; Joseph, son of Jacob, receiving the birthright, but his\r\nbrother Levi receiving the Priesthood in Israel, and Judah the promise\r\nof the Messiah. Even in Book of Mormon times, Nephi was the younger\r\nbrother of Sam, a faithful man, and Nephi ordained his brother Jacob,\r\nnot his son. Alma who became the High Priest of the Nephite church\r\nwas not a son of Mosiah who by right of birth became the king of the\r\npeople. And thus we might go on. It is a peculiar law indeed when the\r\nLord ignores it almost if not quite every time, and we may conclude\r\nthat it is a man-made doctrine concocted to bolster up the claim of an\r\naspiring set of men, not inspired of the Lord.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHOSEN BY HIS FATHER.\r\n\r\nWe will now consider the claim that the president of the \"Reorganized\"\r\nChurch was appointed by his father. They base their claim on the\r\ntestimony of the following witnesses: (1) the statement of the\r\npresident of the \"Reorganization,\" (2) the statement of Lyman Wight,\r\n(3) the statement of James Whitehead, (4) the statement of John S.\r\nCarter, (5) and the statement of William Smith.\r\n\r\nThe president of their church declares that he was blessed in Liberty\r\nJail, twice afterwards before the fall of 1843, and again publicly in\r\nthe Grove at Nauvoo. (True Succession, p. 40). However, he is very\r\ncareful in the wording of his statement and deals with glittering\r\ngeneralities. All he dare tell us is that the \"promise and blessing\r\nof a life of usefulness to the cause of truth was pronounced upon his\r\nhead.\" Lyman Wight declares that the Prophet blessed his son in Liberty\r\nJail in 1839 as his successor. In another place he states that this\r\nblessing was given shortly after they came out of Liberty Jail. (See\r\nSuccession, pp. 51-2). So you see that Lyman Wight contradicts himself.\r\nWe will further examine his statement. Sidney Rigdon, Caleb Baldwin\r\nand Alexander McRae were fellow prisoners with the Prophet Joseph,\r\nPatriarch Hyrum and Lyman Wight in Liberty. If any such blessing or\r\nordination, or whatever you desire to call it, had taken place at\r\nthat time these brethren would have known something of it. Moreover,\r\nHyrum Smith and Sidney Rigdon were counselors to the President, and\r\nin such an appointment they would in all reason have been called on\r\nto assist in such blessing; an account of it would have been made on\r\nthe records of the Church. In other words it would have been done in\r\nan official way, and not in a corner. These fellow prisoners with the\r\nProphet and Patriarch, even including Lyman Wight, knew nothing of\r\nsuch an appointment, calling or ordination while in Liberty prison.\r\nNo record of such a thing was made. Again, that such a blessing did\r\nnot take place, either in or shortly after they came out of that\r\nprison, is quite evident from the fact that Sidney Rigdon, August 8,\r\n1844, while making his claim to the \"guardianship\" of the Church,\r\ndeclared that there could be no successor to Joseph Smith. It is also\r\nquite evident that this expression was an afterthought on the part\r\nof Lyman Wight from the fact that on that memorable 8th of August,\r\n1844, he voted to sustain the Twelve Apostles as the presiding quorum\r\nand Presidency of the Church, (History of the Church, for August 8,\r\n1844). If such a thing had taken place Sidney Rigdon and Lyman Wight\r\nwould most certainly have remembered it on that day. But they were not\r\nonly ignorant of such a thing, but each took a course diametrically\r\nopposed to this alleged blessing. The entire lives of Caleb Baldwin and\r\nAlexander McRae also protest against the statement of Lyman Wight.[4]\r\n\r\nThe testimony of James Whitehead is as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"I recollect a meeting that was held in the winter of 1843,\r\n    at Nauvoo, Ill., prior to Joseph Smith's death, at which the\r\n    appointment was made by him, Joseph Smith, of his successor. His\r\n    son Joseph was selected as his successor. Joseph Smith did the\r\n    talking. There were present Joseph and Hyrum Smith, John Taylor,\r\n    and some others who also spoke on the subject; there were 25 I\r\n    suppose at the meeting. At that meeting Joseph Smith, the present\r\n    presiding officer of the complainant church, was selected by his\r\n    father as his successor. He was ordained and anointed at that\r\n    meeting. Hyrum Smith, the Patriarch, anointed him, and Joseph, his\r\n    father, blessed him and ordained him and Newel K. Whitney poured\r\n    the oil on his head, and he was set apart to be his father's\r\n    successor in office, holding all the powers that his father held.\r\n    I cannot tell all the persons that were present, there was a good\r\n    many there. John Taylor and Willard Richards, they were two of the\r\n    Twelve, Ebenezer Robinson was present, and George J. Adams, Alpheus\r\n    Cutler, and Reynolds Cahoon. I cannot tell them all; I was there\r\n    too.\"\r\n\r\nNewel K. Whitney, John Taylor, Willard Richards and Reynolds Cahoon all\r\nremained with the Church and came with the Twelve to Utah. Their entire\r\nlives protest against this falsehood of James Whitehead. They deny that\r\nany such ordination ever took place. Ebenezer Robinson also denies it\r\nand after the martyrdom, he followed Sidney Rigdon, and later joined\r\nthe Whitmerites. If George J. Adams was present on such an occasion, he\r\nsoon forgot it, for after the martyrdom, he followed James J. Strang\r\nand acknowledged him as the legal successor to the Prophet Joseph\r\nSmith, and was the very man who crowned Strang \"king\" on Beaver Island.\r\nAlpheus Cutler also denied that any such thing as this occurred. I\r\nshall read his testimony. This is the statement of Abraham Kimball, his\r\ngrandson:\r\n\r\nFather Cutler said:\r\n\r\n    \"I know that Brigham Young is Joseph Smith's legal and lawful\r\n    successor, and always did know it. But the reason I am where I\r\n    am, I could not be led but must lead. I have run my race and must\r\n    meet my fate, and I know what my doom is, as I died once as dead\r\n    as any one dies. And I went to the land of spirits, and saw the\r\n    crown I should wear if I remained faithful and the condemnation I\r\n    should meet if I failed. I begged to stay. I was informed I could\r\n    not remain now, but must return and warn sinners to repent. And\r\n    the first word I spoke on returning was to Sidney Rigdon, who\r\n    was bending over me, 'Sidney, repent of your sins or you will be\r\n    damned.' He then continued. 'I know that Mormonism is true. I know\r\n    that Heber C. Kimball is your father, and Isaac's and he is a good\r\n    man. Now I want you to take Isaac and return to your father, and\r\n    remain true to Mormonism and never yield the point, for it will\r\n    save and exalt you in the kingdom of God and all who will live\r\n    it to the end of their days.' He then wept like a child, which\r\n    caused my eyes to moisten. After recovering himself he continued by\r\n    saying: 'Now my boy, I want to ask one favor of you, and that is\r\n    that you will never reveal what I have told you today to the people\r\n    I lead while I live as you boys are going away and I depend on the\r\n    people for my support.' I promised him I would do as requested. He\r\n    then released me to go visiting.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Now, Mr. Wilcox (E. S. Wilcox) and friends, I am in a shape that I\r\n    may be called to meet my God any minute, as disease is praying upon\r\n    my poor body and I am near a skeleton, and my flesh may soon be\r\n    devoured by worms; but I bear testimony to you before my God that\r\n    the statement I have made of Alpheus Cutler's confession is correct\r\n    as near as I can word it.\"--Saints' Herald, Vol. 52:255.\r\n\r\nYou see that each of these men named by James Whitehead give the lie\r\nto his declaration by their entire lives, but this is not all. Joseph\r\nSmith of the \"Reorganized\" Church denies it himself. While he states\r\nthat he was blessed by his father, in his testimony under oath in the\r\nTemple lot suit, he said:\r\n\r\n    \"No, sir, I did not state that I was ordained by my father; I did\r\n    not make the statement. I was NOT ordained by my father as his\r\n    successor--according to my understanding of the word ordained, I\r\n    was not\"--Plaintiff's Abstract, Page 79, Par. 126.\r\n\r\nThus the testimony of James Whitehead is worthless. John S. Carter said\r\nthe Prophet chose his son at a public meeting in Nauvoo on a Sunday,\r\n\"not long before Joseph was killed.\" (True Succession, page 48). Yet\r\nnone of the people knew of this. Nothing was said of it during the\r\ntrouble with Sidney Rigdon. And William Marks, president of the Nauvoo\r\nStake, would most likely be present at the public meetings held on\r\nSundays in Nauvoo. Yet he supported the claim of Sidney Rigdon to be\r\nthe guardian when the latter declared that there could be no successor.\r\nIt is a little strange that such an appointment could be made at a\r\npublic meeting and all the people--just a few months later--be ignorant\r\nof it. Where were the people the day this public meeting was held? How\r\nmuch easier it would have been for Sidney Rigdon to have said, August\r\n8, 1844: \"I want to be appointed 'Guardian' until young Joseph grows\r\nup,\" instead of declaring that no successor could be appointed! How\r\neasy it would have been for Lyman Wight to have said, \"I was present\r\nwhen Joseph blessed his son in Liberty prison, as his successor,\" or\r\nfor James Whitehead and John S. Carter to have declared that young\r\nJoseph had been ordained as his father's successor in a public meeting\r\nin Nauvoo shortly before the martyrdom, and thus have reminded the\r\npeople of it. How strange that such an important occurrence should slip\r\nthe minds of the entire people on such a vital occasion? But they did\r\nnot think of it. The truth is it was an afterthought on the part of\r\nthese men.\r\n\r\nAnother thing which is peculiar: There were too many \"appointments\"\r\nand \"ordinations\" of this \"successor\" which makes the thing look\r\nsuspicious. It is hardly reasonable to suppose that the Prophet,\r\n\"appointed,\" \"blessed,\" and \"ordained\" his son to this office every few\r\ndays. If such a thing had taken place it would have been done in the\r\nproper way and manner in the presence of the presiding officers of the\r\nChurch and a proper record of it would have been made and filed away.\r\nBut the records of the Church are silent and it is quite significant\r\nthat Lyman Wight, James Whitehead, John S. Carter and even Joseph\r\nof the \"Reorganization\" himself had \"forgotten\" this \"appointing\"\r\nor \"ordination\" at the most critical moment for it to have been\r\nmentioned--August 8, 1844.\r\n\r\nWilliam Smith stated that the right of Presidency was by lineage,\r\nand therefore he supported the son of the Prophet in 1850, or even\r\nin November, 1845. (True Succession, p. 17). Yet William Smith knew\r\nof no appointment or ordination of young Joseph, although he was one\r\nof the Apostles, and would have been sure to have known had such a\r\nthing taken place. In May, 1845, he stated that the Twelve were the\r\nproper authorities to lead the Church. (Times and Seasons, 6:904).\r\nHe was excommunicated in the following October and it was not till\r\nafter his excommunication that he advocated the right of young Joseph.\r\nFurthermore, William Smith claimed that he was himself ordained by his\r\nbrother to lead the Church (Roberts' Succession, pp. 103-105.) And he\r\nalso followed James J. Strang and accepted him as the \"successor\" until\r\nexcommunicated from that cult.\r\n\r\nNow, can we put any credence in the testimonies of such men as Lyman\r\nWight, James Whitehead, John S. Carter, and William Smith? Most\r\nassuredly not.\r\n\r\nThat the Prophet did not choose his son is quite evident also from the\r\nfollowing testimony given by reliable witnesses and at the proper time:\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF PRESIDENT YOUNG.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting held at Nauvoo, August 7, 1844, he said:\r\n\r\n    \"How often has Joseph said to the Twelve, 'I have laid the\r\n    foundation and you must build thereon, for upon your shoulders the\r\n    kingdom rests. * * * * I tell you in the name of the Lord, that\r\n    no man can put another between the Twelve and the Prophet Joseph\r\n    Smith. Why? Because Joseph was their file leader, and he has\r\n    committed into their hands the keys of the kingdom in this last\r\n    dispensation for all the world; don't put a thread between the\r\n    Priesthood of God.\"--(History of the Church for August 7, 1844).\r\n\r\nAnd in a letter written to Orson Spencer, January 23, 1848, President\r\nYoung said:\r\n\r\n    \"Joseph told the Twelve the year before he died, 'There is not one\r\n    key or power to be bestowed on this Church to lead the people into\r\n    the celestial gate but I have give you, showed you, and talked\r\n    it over to you, the kingdom is set up, and you have the perfect\r\n    pattern, and you can go and build up the kingdom and go in at the\r\n    celestial gate, taking your train with you.\"--Mill.

President Young is our president, and our head, and\r\n    he puts the shoes on first. If Brother Hyrum had remained here, he\r\n    would have put them on. Hyrum has gone with Joseph and is still his\r\n    counselor.

He conducted us\r\n    through every ordinance of the Holy Priesthood, and when he had\r\n    gone through with all the ordinances, he rejoiced very much, and\r\n    said, 'Now, if they kill me, you have got all the keys, and all\r\n    the ordinances and you can confer them upon others, and the hosts\r\n    of Satan will not be able to tear down the kingdom, as fast as you\r\n    will be able to build it up;' and now, said he, 'on your shoulders\r\n    will the responsibility of leading this people rest, for the Lord\r\n    is going to let me rest awhile.'\"--Times and Seasons, 5: 651.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.\r\n\r\n    \"Has the Prophet Joseph found Elder Rigdon in his councils when he\r\n    organized the quorum of the Twelve, a few months before his death,\r\n    to prepare them for the endowment?

SMITH'S TESTIMONY.\r\n\r\n    \"I was a resident of Nauvoo, State of Illinois, from 1840 to 1846.\r\n    I was married to George A. Smith, July 25, 1841, Elder Don Carlos\r\n    Smith performing the ceremony. Near the close of the year 1843,\r\n    or in the beginning of the year 1844, I received the ordinance of\r\n    anointing in a room in Sister Emma Smith's house in Nauvoo, and\r\n    the same day, in company with my husband, I received my endowment\r\n    in the upper room over the Prophet Joseph Smith's store. The\r\n    endowments were given under the direction of the Prophet Joseph\r\n    Smith, who afterwards gave us lectures or instructions in regard to\r\n    the endowment ceremonies. They are the same today as they were then.\r\n\r\n    In the year 1844, a short time before the death of the Prophet\r\n    Joseph Smith, it was my privilege to attend a regular prayer circle\r\n    meeting in the upper room over the Prophet's store. There were\r\n    present at this meeting most of the Twelve Apostles, their wives,\r\n    and a number of other prominent brethren and their wives. On that\r\n    occasion the Prophet arose and spoke at great length, and during\r\n    his remarks I heard him say that he had conferred on the heads\r\n    of the Twelve Apostles all the keys and powers pertaining to the\r\n    Priesthood, and that upon the heads of the Twelve Apostles the\r\n    burden of the kingdom rested, and they would have to carry it.\"[5]\r\n\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN F. JOHNSON'S TESTIMONY.\r\n\r\nAt the eighty-seventh birthday anniversary celebration of Elder\r\nBenjamin F. Johnson, held at Mesa, Arizona, July 29, 1905, that\r\nPatriarch said:\r\n\r\n    \"I speak of things of which I know I was the business partner of\r\n    Joseph Smith, from my mission until the time of his martyrdom, was\r\n    as familiar with him as with my brother or my father.\r\n\r\n    \"Do I know that Brigham Young was the true successor of Joseph\r\n    Smith? I knew it before the Prophet was martyred, for Joseph had\r\n    made it known. I was present when the Prophet gave his charge to\r\n    the Twelve Apostles, when in council, after solemn prayer, he rose\r\n    up with the light of heaven shining in his countenance, related\r\n    his experiences with reference to the beginning of this work, the\r\n    responsibilities placed upon him, the persecutions and hardships\r\n    through which he had passed. He declared that God had revealed all\r\n    the truth necessary to save mankind, had given unto him the keys\r\n    of the kingdom, and he had carried the weight and load thus far,\r\n    and then, speaking directly to the Twelve, he said: 'I now roll off\r\n    the burden of this responsibility upon you; I give unto you all the\r\n    keys and powers bestowed upon me, and I say unto you, that unless\r\n    you round up your shoulders and bear off this kingdom you will be\r\n    damned.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEZRA T. CLARK'S TESTIMONY.\r\n\r\n    \"Before I left Nauvoo, I heard the Prophet Joseph say he would give\r\n    the Saints a key whereby they would never be led away or deceived,\r\n    and that was: 'The Lord would never suffer the majority of this\r\n    people to be led away or deceived by imposters, nor would he allow\r\n    the records of this Church to fall into the hands of the enemy.'\r\n    I heard Joseph say this, and I also heard him say that he would\r\n    roll the burden of the Apostleship upon the quorum of the Twelve.\r\n    I heard Joseph preach many times; heard him in the last sermon he\r\n    ever delivered, bear testimony to the truth of the work that God\r\n    had called him to; also that the Lord had never suffered him to be\r\n    slain by his enemies, because his work had not been done, until a\r\n    short time ago. He had now laid the foundation of this work, and\r\n    rolled the burden of the Priesthood upon the Twelve; and having\r\n    given them their washings and anointings, they would now bear off\r\n    this work triumphantly, and it would roll on faster than ever\r\n    before; and, if the Lord was willing to accept him, he was willing\r\n    to go.\"--M. I. A. Era, Vol. 5: 202.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPERLY ORDAINED.\r\n\r\nWe will now consider the claim that Joseph Smith of the\r\n\"Reorganization\" was properly ordained. We must first know what\r\nconstitutes a proper ordination.\r\n\r\nFirst. It must be done by those holding authority in the Priesthood who\r\nhave been properly appointed; otherwise the ordination is not valid.\r\n\r\nSecond. The ordination must be approved by the body of the Church and\r\nsanctioned by the Church, or it is not valid. For there is in the\r\nGospel the law of common consent. Doc. & Cov. Sec. 20:63, 65; 26:2.\r\n\r\nThird, If a man exercises his Priesthood contrary to the rules of the\r\nChurch, or in unrighteousness, Amen to his authority.--Doc. & Cov.\r\n121:27.\r\n\r\nFourth, \"Again, I say unto you, it shall not be given to any one to\r\ngo forth to preach my Gospel, or to build up my Church except he be\r\nordained by some one who has authority, and it is known to the Church\r\nthat he has authority, and has been regularly ordained by the heads of\r\nthe Church.\"--(Sec. 42:11).\r\n\r\nThe question is, will the ordination of Joseph Smith of the\r\n\"Reorganization\" stand this test? He was \"ordained\" under the hands of\r\nWilliam Marks (mouth), Zenas H. Gurley, William W. Blair and Samuel\r\nPowers. Messrs. Blair and Powers never did belong to the Church of\r\nJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, so we will pass them by without\r\nconsideration, and will take up the cases of William Marks and Zenas H.\r\nGurley separately.\r\n\r\nWilliam Marks was president of the Nauvoo stake at the time of the\r\nmartyrdom, but it is of a more recent period that we are considering\r\nhim. Did he in 1860 hold the priesthood? William Marks was dropped from\r\nhis position as president of the Nauvoo stake at a conference of the\r\nChurch held October 7, 1844. (T. & S., 5: 692).\r\n\r\nThe whole Church voting not to sustain him, excepting two votes. This\r\naction was taken because he supported the claims of Sidney Rigdon and\r\nopposed the Twelve and action of the Church. In the December following\r\nhe acknowledged his error in the following:\r\n\r\n                                 NOTICE.\r\n\r\n    \"After mature and candid deliberation, I am fully and\r\n    satisfactorily convinced that Mr. Sidney Rigdon's claims to the\r\n    Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,\r\n    are not founded in truth. I have been deceived by his specious\r\n    pretenses and now feel to warn every one over whom I may have\r\n    any influence to beware of him, and his pretended visions and\r\n    revelations. The Twelve are the proper persons to lead the Church.\"\r\n\r\n                                                  \"WILLIAM MARKS.\"\r\n\r\nAfter making this acknowledgment he was received back into fellowship,\r\nbut did not again obtain his former position. Later he became\r\ndissatisfied and withdrew from the Church and was excommunicated.\r\nDuring the exodus he joined James J. Strang, and in 1846 was called\r\nto be a counselor to James J. Strang in his organization. (History\r\nof \"Reorganized\" Church, 3:723). For a time he was also president\r\nof Strang's \"Stake of Zion,\" and also a bishop in his organization\r\n(History of \"Reorganized\" Church, 3:44 and 723). First a \"bishop,\" then\r\n\"president of the 'Stake of Zion,' and then \"counselor\" in Strang's\r\npresidency. In 1852 he became a member of Charles B. Thompson's church\r\n(Reorg. Hist., 3:55 and 3:724). In 1855 he left Thompson and entered\r\ninto an organization with John E. Page and others (Reorg. Hist.,\r\n3:724); and on June 11, 1859, he was received into the \"Reorganization\"\r\non his original baptism,\" \"and they recognized his original ordination\r\nto the Priesthood, although he had been disfellowshiped by the church\r\nthat conferred that Priesthood. After he was disfellowshiped in 1844\r\nand later left the Church and wandered around through the organizations\r\nof James J. Strang, Charles B. Thompson and John E. Page, receiving\r\n\"ordinations,\" and honors, and positions, in these movements, he was\r\nthen received into the \"Reorganized\" Church on his original baptism.\r\nNow, I ask the question in all candor of any fair minded Latter-day\r\nSaint--Did he after this, in 1860, have any authority or Priesthood to\r\nconfer upon Joseph Smith of the \"Reorganization,\" much less the keys\r\nand position of president of the High Priesthood; keys that he never\r\ndid hold?[6]\r\n\r\n\r\nGURLEY'S AUTHORITY.\r\n\r\nZenas H. Gurley, who also laid hands on the head of Joseph in that\r\n\"ordination,\" was ordained to the office of a Seventy in Nauvoo in\r\n1844 under the direction of President Joseph Young. Members of the\r\n\"Reorganization\" claim that he was ordained a Seventy in Far West,\r\nMo., in 1838, but this is not the fact. The records in the Historian's\r\noffice show that this man was ordained in 1844, as I have stated, and\r\nthe following year--April 6, 1845--he was made the senior president of\r\nthe Twenty-first quorum of Seventy. He left the Church as did William\r\nMarks, and therefore lost his Priesthood and had none to confer on the\r\nhead of Joseph Smith.\r\n\r\nNow the revelation clearly indicates that no man is called to build up\r\nthe Church unless it is known to the Church that he has been properly\r\nordained to that calling, by the heads of the Church. But these men\r\nwere not so called. On the 8th of July, 1904, I wrote to Mr. Heman C.\r\nSmith, historian of the \"Reorganization\" as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"In the biographical sketch of Zenas H. Gurley, in the third\r\n    volume of your Church History, the statement is made that he,\r\n    (Zenas H. Gurley) was ordained to the office of a Seventy at Far\r\n    West, Missouri. Would you kindly furnish me with the date of this\r\n    ordination, and also state the authority on which the statement is\r\n    made, and oblige.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of that month I received the following:\r\n\r\n    \"Replying to yours of July 8, will say that the church record in\r\n    the Recorder's office shows that Zenas H. Gurley was ordained to\r\n    the office of Seventy at Far West, Mo., in 1838; day and month\r\n    are not stated. This appears once in the hand-writing of Isaac\r\n    Sheen, former church recorder, and once in the handwriting of\r\n    Henry A. Stebbins, the present church recorder. Elder Stebbins'\r\n    memory is that he received it directly from Elder Gurley; and it is\r\n    presumable that Elder Sheen also had the information direct. It is\r\n    upon the authority of this record that the statement was made in\r\n    the biographical sketch.\"\r\n\r\nYou see they don't know very much about it, it is all presumption. I\r\ncannot conceive of any reason why Mr. Gurley would desire to falsify\r\nthe record, and doubt that he ever made such a statement as the above.\r\nThe fact is, however, that he was not ordained a Seventy in Far West in\r\n1838, but in Nauvoo in 1844.\r\n\r\nNow we will see how much faith they put in the \"authority\" of Mr.\r\nGurley themselves. January 30, 1905, the following communication was\r\nsent to the president of the \"Reorganization:\"\r\n\r\n    \"Will you be so kind as to answer for me the following questions:\r\n    Is it a teaching of the 'Reorganized' Church that the quorums of\r\n    Seventies are limited in number to seven quorums, or do you place a\r\n    limit on these quorums at all?\r\n\r\n    \"Do you recognize as valid any of the ordinations in Nauvoo in\r\n    1844-5, of men to the office of Seventy, under the direction of the\r\n    Twelve Apostles and first council of Seventy, beyond those of the\r\n    first seven quorums?\r\n\r\n    \"In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Utah, the\r\n    custom is to ordain Seventies and organize quorums beyond the\r\n    seventh, and as this practice has been opposed by some of the\r\n    Elders of the 'Reorganized' Church, I was prompted to inquire if\r\n    those Elders were in harmony with the doctrines of the Church.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of January the following was received:\r\n\r\n    \"There are no provisions as revelations as law to the Church for\r\n    the organization of more than seven quorums of Seventy; for that\r\n    reason we do not recognize as valid any of the ordinations in\r\n    Nauvoo in 1844-5 beyond those of the first seven quorums; and\r\n    our teaching is that the number is necessarily limited by direct\r\n    provision of the law.\"\r\n\r\nThus you see, the president of the \"Reorganization\" repudiates the\r\nPriesthood of the very man who \"ordained\" him to the office which he\r\npretends to hold. In conclusion let me add that these men did not\r\nhold the keys of the kingdom and therefore could not bestow them on\r\nanother. The organization to which they belong is not the Church of\r\nJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and all the laying on of hands\r\nthat they can practice from now till dooms day, will not give one\r\nsingle soul the Priesthood of God, for that can only come through the\r\nproper channel--the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. An\r\nordination in the \"Reorganized\" Church is of no more effect than is\r\nan ordination in the Methodist, Presbyterian, or Catholic church, for\r\nthose officiating do not hold the Priesthood, and are not recognized\r\nof God. The Prophet did bestow the keys of the kingdom upon the head\r\nof Brigham Young and with him his associates, the Twelve, as we have\r\nshown with a multitude of unimpeachable testimony. If it was necessary\r\nfor all the prophets from Adam to Peter, James and John to confer their\r\nkeys upon the head of Joseph Smith (See D. & C., 110 and 128 sections),\r\nnotwithstanding he has been ordained to the Priesthood by angels, then\r\nin all reason we must hold that it is necessary for him to bestow the\r\nsame power and keys of the kingdom on others which the evidence shows\r\nthat he did. The men who ordained Joseph Smith of the \"Reorganization\"\r\nwere not regularly ordained and did not hold the keys of the kingdom.\r\nThe Apostles constituted the second quorum in the Church and were\r\nsustained in their calling as the First Presidency of the Church by the\r\nvote of the people August 8, 1844, and again at the fall conference in\r\nOctober of that same year.\r\n\r\nI call the attention of the Latter-day Saints once more to the fact\r\npreviously mentioned (section 43:4-6) that there is but one at a\r\ntime who holds the keys and the right to receive revelation for the\r\nChurch, and that man is the President of the Church. And when the First\r\nPresidency is disorganized through the death of the President, then,\r\naccording to revelation, the Twelve Apostles become the presiding\r\nquorum of the Church, and then, if the Lord has any revelations to\r\ngive to His people they will come through the proper channels--the\r\nPresident of the Twelve. If we will keep this in mind it will be a key\r\nto us as the Lord intended that it should be, by which we may gage\r\nand weigh the pretended revelations of men. When we see this man, or\r\nthat man, or perhaps that woman, or child, giving revelations as was\r\nthe case in the \"Reorganized\" Church when Jason W. Briggs, Zenas H.\r\nGurley, Henry H. Deam and the daughter of Zenas H. Gurley, received\r\n\"revelations\" bearing on the organization of their cult, we will\r\nknow assuredly that these things are not of God. The Lord will never\r\nignore the presiding officer and quorum of the Church, for he respects\r\nauthority, as He requires us to respect authority. And it will always\r\nbe a key to us, if we will bear it in mind, that whenever He has a\r\nrevelation or commandment to give to His people that it will come\r\nthrough the presiding officer of the Church. This is plainly taught in\r\nthe revelations.\r\n\r\nIf there is within the sound of my voice one soul who has not received\r\na testimony of this work, and that Brigham Young was the right man in\r\nthe right place, and the rightful successor, and so on down to the\r\npresent day, then I say to you, when you go home go before the Lord\r\nin the spirit of repentance, and humility, and prayer, and ask Him in\r\nfaith for that knowledge and He will hear your prayers. There is no\r\nreason why any man should be deceived, for the Lord has promised us\r\nthat we shall receive if we ask and if we knock it shall be opened unto\r\nus. By keeping the commandments of God, all men may know of this work\r\nthat it is true. If you will do this, then when these deceivers and\r\npretenders, these men who delight in destroying your faith, come to you\r\nsaying that you are in the dark, you can say to them, get behind me,\r\nfor I will not be deceived by you. I know we have the truth, that this\r\nis the work of the Lord, that Jesus is the Redeemer of the world, and\r\nthat Joseph Smith was a Prophet of God and was called to stand at the\r\nhead of this dispensation, and those keys and that position he will\r\never hold. He was not a fallen Prophet, but died a martyr to this work.\r\nMay God bless you. Amen.\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes\r\n\r\n1. Serious objection is raised to this line of argument by the author\r\nof the \"defense,\" who attempts to place me in a false position by\r\nimputing to me expressions that are not here conveyed. Had he been\r\nhonest in his argument he would have fairly presented what I have\r\nhad to say; but this he has studiously avoided throughout his reply.\r\nHere he argues that the provisions in these revelations regarding\r\na \"successor\" were not limited in their scope, but were to be\r\ncarried out during the life of Joseph Smith. I respectfully call\r\nhis attention to an editorial in the _Saints' Herald_ of August 18,\r\n1888. At that time Joseph Smith, his president, and William W. Blair,\r\ncounselor, were the editors of the _Herald_. The article is called\r\n\"_The Power to Perpetuate the Church_.\" After quoting these passages\r\nthe author--presumably the editor, or his assistant, for it is an\r\neditorial--continues:\r\n\r\n(d) \"The authority to ordain is given unto the Church.\r\n\r\n(e) \" 'Verily, I say unto you, the keys of this kingdom shall never be\r\ntaken from you, while thou art in the world, neither in the world to\r\ncome; nevertheless, through you shall the oracles be given to another;\r\nyea, even unto the Church.'\r\n\r\n(f) \"This language was addressed to Joseph Smith, the one who had been\r\nappointed of God to hold and exercise the gift to receive commandments\r\nand revelations for the Church, two full years after it was said\r\nthrough him _that if he fell away he should have power only to appoint\r\none in his stead_. The saying is preceded by the statement that the\r\nsins of Joseph Smith had been forgiven him, and he should bear the keys\r\nfrom thenceforth.\r\n\r\n(g) \"Joseph Smith was taken away dying a martyr, of which death he was\r\nconscious and made preparation before it occurred. He was not accused\r\nof the Lord of transgression and the gift that had been conferred\r\nupon him taken from him; nor was there a command given him to appoint\r\nanother in his stead because he had been unworthy and the Lord proposed\r\nto depose him from his office. _It was only in the event of the gift\r\nbeing taken from him that he was to so appoint another. This event did\r\nnot occur_. * * *\r\n\r\n\"If Joseph Smith had been adjudged unworthy to longer bear the \"keys\"\r\nand exercise the \"gift,\" which had been conferred upon him, he was\r\nunder obligation to declare it, at the command of God, and to designate\r\nwho the Lord had ordained to act in his stead. _The fact that no such\r\ndeclaration was made_, is strong proof that no command came from God,\r\nand _no one was so designated to act in his stead_ while he was still\r\nliving. This proof is made stronger still by the declaration made by\r\nJoseph Smith just before his death: \"I go as a lamb to the slaughter.\"\r\n\r\n(h) \"If Joseph Smith continued to abide in Christ, which all must admit\r\nthat he did, in that case the gift conferred was to continue with him;\r\nnot only in the present world, the life of the flesh, but the keys were\r\nto remain with him in the world to come. But that no harm could come\r\nto the Church, and the elders be put in possession of a key to the\r\nsituation in case Joseph Smith should be taken, _they were told that\r\nthere was no one other than he appointed until he was taken, and that\r\nwhen this should occur the oracles should be given to the Church_.\r\n\r\n(k) \"The command, 'Nevertheless through you shall the oracles be given\r\nunto the Church,' is equivalent to the saying, Until Joseph Smith be\r\ntaken he shall continue to act in the office unto which he is called,\r\nand shall continue to exercise the gifts conferred upon him; but\r\nwhen he is taken, _then_ the oracles and the power conferred in them\r\n_are lodged with, or in the Church_, to be exercised and observed in\r\naccordance with the revelations and commandments given to and accepted\r\nby the Church, from God through him, up to the time he should be taken.\"\r\n\r\nThe writer then quotes sec. 87, paragraph 5, Reorganite Doctrine and\r\nCovenants, and continues:\r\n\r\n(n) \"This commandment was given to Joseph Smith, Sidney Rigdon and\r\nFrederick G. Williams. The latter died before Joseph Smith did; and\r\nwhatever may have been the rights of Sidney Rigdon at the death of\r\nJoseph Smith, he was not permitted to stand in Joseph's stead nor act\r\nas his successor. This confirms the thought that Joseph was to continue\r\nin the exercise of the gift conferred upon him, during his life, and\r\n_was not to be compelled to appoint another in his stead_.\" (My italics\r\nthroughout.)\r\n\r\nWe concur.\r\n\r\n2. Of this the \"defense\" says: \"Our friend's idea is that 'the order\r\nof this priesthood;' refers to the office of evangelist in particular\r\nrather than to the Melchizedek priesthood in general, although the\r\nlatter is under consideration not only on the page from which the\r\nquotation is taken, but also on the following page and on the two\r\npreceding.\"\r\n\r\nIt does refer to the priesthood of the evangelist, and only by a\r\ndeliberate twisting of the Scriptures can it be made to apply to the\r\nMelchizedek Priesthood in general; it does not read that way. In the\r\nverses preceding the _offices_ of the priesthood have been defined also\r\nthe duties of the officers. The paragraphs immediately preceding speak\r\nof the High Councils.\r\n\r\nVerse 38 declares that the traveling High Council shall call upon the\r\nSeventy when they need assistance, then verse 39 says it is the duty of\r\nthe Twelve to ordain evangelical ministers. From and including verse\r\n40 to 57, is parenthetical and is explanatory of the office of the\r\nEvangelist. Verse 58 continues: \"It is the duty of the Twelve, _also_\r\nto ordain and set in order _all other officers_ in the Church. Only\r\nby misconstruing the revelation can this be given the appearance of\r\napplying to the Melchizedek Priesthood.\r\n\r\nThe critic says: \"If it said 'this _office_ of the Priesthood,' there\r\nmight be some shadow of reason in his contention, but it does not.\"\r\nIs our friend not aware of the fact that the office of the Evangelist\r\n(Patriarch) is spoken of as an order of Priesthood? The Lord said\r\npertaining to Hyrum Smith: \"That my servant Hyrum may take the office\r\nof _Priesthood_ and Patriarch which was appointed unto him by his\r\nfather, by blessing and also by right.\" (Sec. 124:91). And in the\r\nblessing of Hyrum by his brother Joseph at Kirtland: \"He shall stand\r\nin the tracks of his father, and be numbered among those who hold the\r\nright of Patriarchal _Priesthood_, even the Evangelical _Priesthood_\r\nand power shall be upon him.\" It is spoken of as an order of\r\nPriesthood, although a part of the Melchizedek Priesthood, just as the\r\nLevitical is spoken of as an order, included in the Aaronic Priesthood.\r\n\r\n3. The \"defense\" writer says: \"There is not a scrap of evidence that\r\nMoses confirmed upon Joshua a particle of Priesthood--merely the civil\r\nleadership\" The Scriptures say: \"And Joshua the son of Nun was full\r\nof the spirit of wisdom; _for Moses had laid his hands upon him_;\r\nand the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the Lord\r\ncommanded Moses.\" (Deut. 34:9). He may, of course, quibble because it\r\ndoes not say he gave him \"the priesthood\" when he laid hands upon him;\r\nbut surely he did not lay hands on Joshua merely to give him civil\r\nleadership. It was by the power of the Priesthood that he led Israel\r\nand commanded the sun and moon, he could have done it by no other\r\npower. In regard to the others mentioned here who were ordained, the\r\n\"defender\" is absolutely silent.\r\n\r\n4. Of this argument and the testimony that follows the \"defense\" writer\r\nremains silent, the editor of the Herald, however, takes exception\r\nto the statement that Lyman Wight was at the meeting on the 8th of\r\nAugust, having refused to attend. He says: \"Heber C. Kimball and George\r\nMiller came to his house, in her presence, (L. Wight's oldest daughter)\r\nwith a summons from Brigham Young to appear, which he declined to do,\r\ndeclaring that the Twelve were usurping authority. This resulted in a\r\npersonal encounter during which Miller was forcibly evicted from the\r\nroom by Wight and Kimball followed without awaiting the enforcement of\r\nthe order.\"\r\n\r\nIf Lyman Wight refused to attend that meeting then he is incompetent\r\nto say that the Apostles were usurping authority, for he knew nothing\r\nabout it. Moreover, if this statement is true it merely shows the\r\nbitter apostate spirit manifested by Lyman Wight at that time. It\r\nwas his duty to meet with the Twelve and if things were not going as\r\nhe thought they should he had the privilege of stating his feelings;\r\nthis he refused to do, if the statement is correct. His hasty\r\nunchristian-like action and sulking in his house does not redound to\r\nthe credit of the man.\r\n\r\n5. Blood Atonement and Origin of Plural Marriage, p. 104.\r\n\r\n6. Here are a few items in the history of William Marks after he left\r\nthe Church and was excommunicated.\r\n\r\nAt a conference held at Voree, April 6, 1846, \"On motion of William\r\nMarks * * * James J. Strang unanimously called to the chair as\r\nPresident of the Conference.\" \"On motion of Elder William Marks, it was\r\nunanimously resolved that this church receive, acknowledge, and uphold\r\nJames J. Strang as President of this church, Prophet, Seer, Revelator,\r\nand Translator, with our faith and prayers.\"--_Voree Record_.\r\n\r\nApril 8, 1846: \"The First Presidency presented William Marks for the\r\noffice of Bishop of the Church and on motion of Apostle John E. Page,\r\nresolved unanimously (that he) be sustained.\"--_Voree Record_.\r\n\r\nAug. 26, 1849: \"Brother William Marks was then ordained, consecrated\r\nand set apart as Apostle of the Lord, Jesus Christ, a Counselor to the\r\nProphet, one of the First Presidency, and a Prophet of the Most High\r\nGod, under the hands of Presidents Strang and Adams.\"\r\n\r\n\"Brother William Marks was anointed, _ordained_ and set apart to\r\nadminister baptism for the dead, under the hands of Presidents Strang\r\nand Adams.\"--_Voree Record_.\r\n\r\nPreviously, William Marks had forsaken James J. Strang, and January,\r\n1849, James J. Strang had a \"revelation\" in which he said: \"Behold my\r\nservant, William Marks, has gone far astray in departing from me, yet\r\nI will give unto him a little space, that he may return and receive\r\nmy word, and stand in his place; for I remember his works that he has\r\ndone in the time that is past. If he will return and abide faithful, I\r\nwill make him great, and his possessions shall be great, and he shall\r\npossess a city, and his children shall dwell therein; a nation shall\r\ncall him Blessed.\"\r\n\r\nWell, he returned, and at the conference August 25, 1849, arose and\r\nsaid: \"He ought to make a confession to the Saints for _not_ acting in\r\nhis calling and also to ask their forgiveness. Gave a brief history of\r\nthe course he had pursued after the martyrdom of the Prophet Joseph,\r\ntestified that he had ever had the fullest confidence in the work of\r\nthe last days, and knew it was of God, and was now determined by the\r\nhelp of God to go forth in the discharge of his duty and act in the\r\nplace in which he was called by revelation of God through His servant\r\nJames\" [J. Strang].--_Voree Record_.\r\n\r\nHe was received back and sustained.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1852 he joined Charles B. Thompson's organization and\r\nwas \"_ordained_\" \"Chief evangelitical teacher of the School of Faith\r\nin Jehovah's Presbytery of Zion.\" Acting in this calling he wrote an\r\nepistle to \"the School of Faith to all the traveling teacher's quorums\r\nand classes of said school, and Jehovah's presbytery of Zion.\" In that\r\nepistle he said:\r\n\r\n\"Well Brethren: I have lived to see the foundation and the platform\r\nlaid, the principles revealed and the order given, whereby the great\r\nwork of the Father can, and will be accomplished. _There is no doubt\r\nresting on my mind in reference to this work of Baneemy being the work\r\nof God, for I am fully convinced that it is the work it purports to\r\nbe_, the work of the Father spoken of in the Book of Mormon, to prepare\r\nthe way for the restoration of His covenants to the house of Israel.\r\nNow, all who are convinced of this fact ought to move forward and take\r\na decided stand to labor for Jehovah and the benefit of Mankind. I\r\nintend from this time, henceforth, to labor in the cause and give my\r\ninfluence and substance to speed the work.\" (Harbinger and Organ, Vol.\r\n3:52-3-4).\r\n\r\nThis is his testimony when with Thompson. He later organized a quorum\r\nat Batavia, and appointed James Blakeslee--a man who was excommunicated\r\nfrom the Church May 18, 1844, with Francis M. Higbee, Charles Ivans and\r\nAustin Cowles, for apostasy--chief, and Jehial Savage teacher. \"After\r\nthis he joined John E. Page's organization, forgetting how faithful\r\nhe had promised to be in Thompson's organization, and later (1859)\r\nconnected himself with the \"New Organization.\" He was not one of the\r\ntrue fold, for:\r\n\r\n\"When he [the true Shepherd] putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth\r\nbefore them, and the sheep follow him; for they know his voice. And a\r\nstranger will they not follow, but will flee from him; for they know\r\nnot the voice of strangers.\"--(John 10:4-5).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Doctrines of Joseph Smith.\r\n\r\nOne of the charges made by the \"Reorganized\" Church against the Church\r\nof Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is that when the Apostles assumed\r\ntheir place as the presiding quorum following the martyrdom of Joseph\r\nand Hyrum Smith, they departed from the pure Gospel as it was revealed\r\nin the Bible, Book of Mormon, and the revelations and teachings of\r\nthe Prophet Joseph Smith, and in the stead thereof introduced false\r\ndoctrines that were never entertained by the Prophet and were foreign\r\nto the revelations given to the Church. This proves, they declare, the\r\n\"apostasy\" of the Church and its \"rejection\" and the few scattered\r\nmembers who refused to follow the leadership of the Apostles into\r\nforbidden paths, and to accept these \"false doctrines\" retained the\r\nSpirit of the Lord and were directed by Him to \"re-organize\" the\r\n\"faithful\" members into what was then called a \"New Organization\r\nof the Church,\" the name subsequently having been changed to the\r\n\"Re-organized\" Church. They inform us--though it is most likely with\r\nsome misgivings and doubts--that these \"faithful\" few who refused to\r\nfollow after \"false gods,\" or \"bow the knee to Baal,\" still retained\r\nthe Priesthood they had received from the \"Original\" Church and were\r\n\"not rejected as individuals\" although the \"Church was rejected with\r\nits dead.\" Therefore, when these \"faithful\" souls tired of wandering\r\naround in the apostate organizations of James J. Strang, Sidney Rigdon,\r\nWilliam Smith, Charles B. Thompson, and others, as sheep that knew\r\nnot the Master's voice, and therefore followed strangers, receiving\r\nfrom these self-appointed leaders \"ordinations\" and honors, and after\r\nhaving testified that these false teachers were inspired of God and\r\ntheir organizations the work of the Lord--after all this, when they\r\ncame together and formed the \"New Organization\" they were still the\r\n\"faithful\" who had not followed after \"false gods\" or \"bowed the knee\r\nto Baal,\" and had retained power to \"re-organize\" the Church according\r\nto the original pattern, although the Prophet had not commissioned them.\r\n\r\nIn an address to these scattered \"faithful\" written shortly after the\r\n\"New Organization of the Church\" was formed, the declaration was made\r\n\"that we believe that the Church of Christ organized on the 6th day of\r\nApril, A. D. 1830, exists as on that day, wherever six or more Saints\r\nare organized to the pattern in the Book of Doctrine and Covenants.\"\r\nAnd, of course, _they_ are the Saints \"organized according to the\r\npattern\"--if their word can be taken for the fact.\r\n\r\nThe president of their church states it this way: \"The individuals who\r\nkept this covenant (the new and everlasting covenant of the Gospel)\r\nwere accepted of Him and were not rejected, nor their standing before\r\nGod put in jeopardy by the departure of others from the faith. Whatever\r\noffice in the priesthood each held, under the ordinations ordered by\r\nthe call of God and vote of the Church, would remain valid. They could\r\nas elders, priests, teachers, etc., pursue the duties of warning,\r\nexpounding, and inviting all to come to Christ, and by command of\r\nGod, could build up the Church from any single branch, which, like\r\nthemselves, had not bowed the knee to Baal, or departed from the faith\r\nof the Church as founded in the standard works of the body at the death\r\nof Joseph and Hyrum Smith.\"--(Saints' Herald, Feb. 17, 1904).\r\n\r\nIn their attempt to prove that the Apostles led the Church astray\r\nand introduced false doctrines, they have one standard by which the\r\nChurch and the Apostles are measured; but in proving that _they_ are\r\nthe \"faithful who have kept the new and everlasting covenant\" and have\r\nremained in harmony with \"the pattern\" their standard of measurement is\r\nquite another thing. The Church is to be judged by all the unauthorized\r\nsayings and doings of any or all of its members or ministers. Their\r\nchurch is to be judged \"by its authorized doctrines and deeds, and not\r\nby the unauthorized sayings or doings of some or many of its members or\r\nministers.\" (_See Blood Atonement and Origin of Plural Marriage, page\r\n44_).\r\n\r\nThey even go so far in their own defense as to reject the teachings and\r\nrevelations of the Prophet Joseph Smith, wherein they are in conflict\r\nwith their expressed views and have not been received by them by vote\r\nof their church as doctrine; but they deny to us the privilege of being\r\ntried by our \"authorized doctrines and deeds,\" and would force upon us,\r\nas a body, teachings of any member of the Church wherein they think\r\nthey could make a point to their advantage; and this they have done in\r\nthe courts of the land. We grant unto them the right to be tried by\r\nthat rule laid down by the president of their organization, and claim\r\nthe right to be tried by the same kind of standard. The Church of Jesus\r\nChrist of Latter-day Saints is not responsible for the sayings or\r\ndoings of any individual in conflict with that which has been received\r\nas a standard by which the Church is to be governed. We are to be\r\njudged by _our_ authorized doctrines and deeds not by the whims or\r\nnotions of men. But the ministers of the \"Reorganization\" have not been\r\nwilling from the beginning to permit us to stand on this platform, but\r\ninsist that we stand on the platform they have prepared for us.\r\n\r\nThe Bible, Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of\r\nGreat Price, including the Articles of Faith, have been received by\r\nthe vote of the Church in general conference assembled as the standard\r\nworks of the Church. On this platform we stand. The Church is not\r\nresponsible for the remarks made by any Elder or for the numerous\r\nbooks that have been written. The authors of the words or books must\r\nbe responsible for their own utterances. It is not to be supposed from\r\nthis that all that has been written outside of the standard works of\r\nthe Church is discarded and rejected, for these things are profitable\r\nas helps in the government of the Church, and to promote faith in the\r\nmembers. The point is this, if in these books mistakes are found, \"they\r\nare the mistakes of men,\" and the Church as an organization is not to\r\nbe held accountable for them, but for that which is received from time\r\nto time by vote of the Church, as it comes through the President of the\r\nHigh Priesthood. When the Lord reveals his mind and will it is to be\r\nreceived, \"whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it\r\nis the same,\" but we are not to be judged by \"unauthorized sayings or\r\ndeeds.\"\r\n\r\nThe ministers of the \"Reorganization\" tell us that the Church has\r\ndeparted from the teachings received from 1830-1844 in many principles\r\nof vital importance, viz., the Godhead, marriage, the atonement, the\r\nlocation of Zion, Temple building and the ceremonies therein, and other\r\nthings, in which they have strictly adhered to the original faith. We\r\nwill take these subjects up one by one and see which organization it\r\nis that is following the teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith and the\r\ndoctrines of \"the Original Church.\" First as to the Godhead.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GODHEAD.\r\n\r\nThe first article of faith of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\r\nSaints, reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\"We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ,\r\nand in the Holy Ghost.\"\r\n\r\nWe accept these three personages as the supreme governing council in\r\nthe heavens. The Father and the Son have tabernacles of flesh and\r\nbones, and the Holy Ghost is a personage of spirit. (D. & C. 130:22).\r\nWe worship the Father in the name of the Son, who is the Mediator\r\nbetween God and man, and His is the only name given whereby man can\r\nbe saved (D. & C. 18:23). We accept Jesus as the Only Begotten Son\r\nof the Father in the flesh, although we are all His offspring in the\r\nspirit, (Acts 17:28) and therefore His children. This is the teaching\r\nof \"Mormonism.\"\r\n\r\nWe are accused by the Reorganites, however, of departing from the\r\ndoctrines of the Prophet Joseph Smith in that we believe in a plurality\r\nof Gods. That we believe in a plurality of Gods is true, and if they\r\ndo not--and they confess almost unanimously that they do not--then\r\nthey are not following the teachings and revelations of Joseph Smith.\r\nIf the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost are separate and distinct\r\npersonages, then they are three Gods, then they are plural, this fact\r\nJoseph Smith taught to the world. But our Reorganite friends quote from\r\na purported discourse of President Brigham Young to the effect that\r\nAdam is our Father and our God, and the only God with whom we have to\r\ndo. But this discourse even if reported correctly--which we have reason\r\nto believe is not the case--is not the doctrine of the Church and has\r\nnot been received by the Church. Joseph Smith the Prophet taught a\r\nplurality of Gods, and moreover, that man, by obeying the commandments\r\nof God and keeping the whole law will eventually reach the power and\r\nexaltation by which he also will become a God. And if Reorganites do\r\nnot accept this truth, then they have departed from the teachings of\r\nthe Prophet Joseph Smith. The doctrine of plurality of Gods, did not\r\noriginate with Brigham Young, but was taught him by Joseph Smith.\r\n\r\nIn a discourse delivered by the Prophet in Nauvoo at the April\r\nconference of the Church in 1844, he said:\r\n\r\n    \"I will go back to the beginning before the world was, to show\r\n    what kind of a being God is. What sort of a being was God in the\r\n    beginning? Open your ears and hear, all ye ends of the earth, for\r\n    I am going to prove it to you by the Bible, and to tell you the\r\n    designs of God in relation to the human race, and why He interferes\r\n    with the affairs of man.\r\n\r\n    \"_God himself_ was once as we are now, and is an exalted man, and\r\n    sits enthroned in yonder heavens! That is the great secret. If the\r\n    veil were rent today, and the great God who holds this world in\r\n    its orbit, and who upholds all worlds and all things by His power,\r\n    was to make Himself visible,--I say, if you were to see Him today,\r\n    you would see Him like a man in form--like yourselves in all the\r\n    person, image and very form as a man; for Adam was created in the\r\n    very fashion, image and likeness of God, and received instruction\r\n    from, and walked, talked and conversed with Him, as one man talks\r\n    and communes with another.\r\n\r\n* * * * * * * *\r\n\r\n    \"I shall comment on the very first Hebrew word in the Bible; I\r\n    will make a comment on the very first sentence of the history of\r\n    creation in the Bible--_Berosheit_. I want to analyze the word.\r\n    _Baith_--in, by, through, and everything else. _Rosh_--the head.\r\n    _Sheit_--grammatical termination. When the inspired man wrote it,\r\n    he did not put the baith there. An old Jew without any authority\r\n    added the word; he thought it too bad to begin to talk about the\r\n    head! It read first, 'The head one of the Gods brought forth the\r\n    Gods.' That is the true meaning of the word--_Baurau_ signifies\r\n    to bring forth. If you do not believe it, you do not believe the\r\n    learned man of God. Learned men can teach you no more than what I\r\n    have told you. _Thus the head God brought forth the Gods in the\r\n    grand council_.\r\n\r\n    \"I will transpose and simplify it in the English language. Oh ye\r\n    lawyers, ye doctors, and ye priests, who have persecuted me, I want\r\n    to let you know that the Holy Ghost knows something as well as you\r\n    do. The head God called together the Gods and sat in grand council\r\n    to bring forth the world.\"--(See Era, January, 1909).\r\n\r\nIn another discourse delivered June 16, 1844 the Prophet said:\r\n\r\n    \"And hath made us kings and priests unto God _and His Father_: to\r\n    Him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.\"--(Rev. 1:6). It\r\n    is altogether correct in the translation. Now, you know that of\r\n    late some malicious and corrupt men have sprung up and apostatized\r\n    from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and they\r\n    declare that the Prophet believes in a plurality of Gods; and,\r\n    lo and behold! we have discovered a very great secret, they cry,\r\n    'The Prophet says there are many Gods, and this proves that he has\r\n    fallen.'\"\r\n\r\n    \"I will preach on the plurality of Gods. I have selected this text\r\n    for the express purpose. I wish to declare I have always, and in\r\n    all congregations when I have preached on the subject of the Deity,\r\n    it has been the plurality of Gods. It has been preached by the\r\n    Elders fifteen years. I have always declared God to be a distinct\r\n    personage, Jesus Christ a separate and distinct personage from God\r\n    the Father, and that the Holy Ghost was a distinct personage and a\r\n    spirit; and these three constitute three distinct personages and\r\n    three Gods. If this is in accordance with the New Testament, lo\r\n    and behold! we have three Gods anyhow, and they are plural; and\r\n    who can contradict it? The text says--'And hath made us kings and\r\n    priests unto God _and His Father_.' The apostles have discovered\r\n    that there were Gods above, for Paul says God was the Father of\r\n    our Lord Jesus Christ. My object was to preach the Scriptures,\r\n    and preach the doctrine they contain, there being a God above the\r\n    Father of our Lord Jesus Christ I am bold to declare. * * John was\r\n    one of the men, and the Apostles declare they were made kings and\r\n    priests unto God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. It reads just\r\n    so in the Revelations. Hence, the doctrine of a plurality of Gods\r\n    is as prominent in the Bible as any other doctrine. It is all over\r\n    the face of the Bible. It stands beyond the power of controversy. A\r\n    wayfaring man, though a fool, need not err therein.'\r\n\r\n    \"Paul says there are Gods many, and Lords many * * * But to us\r\n    there is but one God--that is, _pertaining_ to us; and he is in all\r\n    and through all. But if Joseph Smith says there are Gods many and\r\n    Lords many, they cry: 'Away with him! Crucify him, crucify him!'\r\n    Mankind verily say that the Scriptures are with them. Search the\r\n    Scriptures, for they testify of things that these apostates would\r\n    gravely pronounce blasphemy. Paul, if Joseph Smith is a blasphemer,\r\n    you are. I say there are Gods many, and Lords many, but to us\r\n    only one; and we are to be in subjection to that one, and no man\r\n    can limit the bounds or the eternal existence of eternal time. *\r\n    * * Some say I do not interpret the Scriptures the same as they\r\n    do. they say it means the heathens' gods. Paul says there are\r\n    Gods many, and Lords many; and that makes a plurality of Gods, in\r\n    spite of the whims of all men. * * You know, and I testify, that\r\n    Paul had no allusion to the heathen gods. I have it from God, and\r\n    get over it if you can. I have a witness of the Holy Ghost, and\r\n    a testimony that Paul had no allusion to the heathen gods in the\r\n    text. I will show from the Hebrew Bible that I am correct, and the\r\n    first word shows a plurality of Gods; and I want the apostates\r\n    and learned men to come here and prove to the contrary, if they\r\n    can. An unlearned boy must give you a little Hebrew. _Berosheit\r\n    Baurau Eloheim ait aushamayeen vehau auraits_, rendered by King\r\n    James' translators, 'In the beginning God created the heavens and\r\n    the earth. I want to analyze the word _Berosheit. Rosh_, the head;\r\n    _sheit_, a grammatical termination. The _Baith_ was not originally\r\n    put there when the inspired man wrote it, but it has been since\r\n    added by an old Jew. Baurau signifies to bring forth; _Eloheim_ is\r\n    from the word _Eloi_, God in the singular number; and by adding the\r\n    word _heim_, it renders it Gods. It read first--'In the beginning\r\n    the head of the Gods brought forth the Gods,' or, as others have\r\n    translated it--'The head of the Gods called the Gods together.'\r\n\r\n* * * * * * *\r\n\r\n    \"The head God organized the heavens and the earth. I defy all the\r\n    learning in the world to refute me. 'In the beginning the head of\r\n    the Gods organized the heavens and the earth.' * * If we pursue\r\n    the Hebrew text further, it reads--'_Berosheit baurau Eloheim\r\n    ait Aushamayeen vehau auraits_,' 'The head one of the Gods said,\r\n    'Let us make man in our own image.' I once asked a learned Jew\r\n    'If the Hebrew language compells us to render all words ending in\r\n    heim in the plural, why not render the first Eloheim plural? He\r\n    replied--'That is the rule, with few exceptions; but in this case\r\n    it would ruin the Bible.' He acknowledged I was right. I came here\r\n    to investigate these things precisely as I believe them. Hear and\r\n    judge for yourselves: and if you go away satisfied, well and good.\r\n\r\n    \"In the very beginning the Bible shows there is a plurality of Gods\r\n    beyond the power of refutation. * * * The word _Eloheim_ ought to\r\n    be in the plural all the way through--Gods. The head of the Gods\r\n    appointed one God for us; and when you take a (this) view of the\r\n    subject, it sets one free to see all the beauty, holiness and\r\n    perfection of all the Gods.\"--(See Mill. Star, Vol. 24:108, et seq).\r\n\r\nThis is the doctrine taught by Joseph Smith the Prophet at Nauvoo, and\r\nwe accept his teachings as authentic. \"But this was not published until\r\nafter the Prophet's death,\" says our Reorganite objectors, and \"Brigham\r\nYoung tampered with history and made it read to suit himself, therefore\r\nwe do not accept it.\" Nevertheless these two discourses were delivered\r\nbefore the congregation of the Saints and thousands of them heard\r\nthe Prophet deliver these remarks, and _if he had not spoken as here\r\nrepresented_, the Apostles would not have dared publish his remarks\r\nwithin a month or two after they were delivered, for the people would\r\nhave discovered the deception. But thousands of them have testified\r\nthat these discourses were delivered by Joseph Smith. None can, without\r\nsuccessful contradiction, say he did not deliver them. Again, the\r\nobjection is raised, that these discourses were never accepted by the\r\nChurch as doctrine, and therefore are not binding even if the Prophet\r\ndid deliver them. Very well; the fact remains that the Church has\r\naccepted the Bible _as far as it is translated correctly_. Therefore,\r\nwhere it is not translated correctly we should receive the correct\r\ntranslation _when it is given_. The Prophet says the Hebrew word\r\n_Eloheim_ is plural and means Gods, and should have been so translated\r\nin the Bible throughout. Is that true? If you think not, why not accept\r\nthe Prophet's challenge to prove to the contrary? If you cannot, then\r\nhold your peace about it being binding!\r\n\r\nWell, my friends of the \"Reorganization\" we will give you another\r\nquotation from the Prophet Joseph Smith, _this time it was published_\r\nbefore his martyrdom and that too by himself, for which he declared he\r\nstood responsible (See Times and Seasons, Vol. 3:710). This quotation\r\nis taken from the _Book of Abraham_ in the _Times and Seasons_ for\r\nMarch 1, 1842, which the Prophet says are some ancient records \"from\r\nthe Catacombs of Egypt, purporting to be the writings of Abraham,\r\nwhich he made in Egypt, called the _Book of Abraham_, written by his\r\nown hand, upon papyrus.\" These records were translated by the Prophet\r\nat Nauvoo, and in the MS. History of the Church prepared under his\r\ndirection, he declares that they are absolutely the writings of\r\nAbraham, a fact which a reading of them will show. If you accept Joseph\r\nSmith as a Prophet, Seer and Revelator, you must, if you believe he\r\ntranslated the record, accept these writings, at least as the genuine\r\ntranslations of Abraham's record. There is no room for quibbling here.\r\n\r\nThis is from the Prophet's translation:\r\n\r\n    \"Thus, I Abraham, talked with the Lord face to face, as one man\r\n    talketh with another. * * * * *\r\n\r\n    \"Now the Lord had shewn unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that\r\n    were organized before the world was; and among all these there were\r\n    many of the noble and great ones, and God saw these souls that they\r\n    were good, and he stood in the midst of them, and He said, these,\r\n    I will make my rulers; for He stood among those that were spirits,\r\n    and He saw that they were good; and He said unto me, Abraham,\r\n    thou art one of them, thou wast chosen before thou wast born. And\r\n    there stood one among them that was like unto God, and He said\r\n    unto those, who were with Him, We will go down, for there is space\r\n    there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an\r\n    Earth whereon these may dwell; and we will prove them herewith, to\r\n    see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall\r\n    command them; and they who keep their first estate shall be added\r\n    upon; and they who keep not their first estate, shall not have\r\n    glory in the same kingdom with those who keep their first estate;\r\n    and they who keep their second estate, shall have glory added upon\r\n    their heads forever and forever.\r\n\r\n    Verse 23. \"And the Lord said, who shall I send? And one answered\r\n    like unto the Son of Man, here am I, send me. And another answered\r\n    and said, here am I, send me. And the Lord said, I will send the\r\n    first. And the second was angry and kept not his first estate, and,\r\n    at that day, many followed after him. And then the Lord said, let\r\n    us go down; and they went down at the beginning, and they organized\r\n    and formed (that is, the Gods) the heavens and the earth. And the\r\n    earth, after it was formed, was empty and desolate; because they\r\n    had not formed anything but the earth; and darkness reigned upon\r\n    the face of the deep, and the spirit of the Gods was brooding upon\r\n    the face of the water.\r\n\r\n    24. And they said, the Gods, let there be light, and there was\r\n    light. And they, the Gods, comprehended the light, for it was\r\n    bright; and they divided the light, or caused it to be divided from\r\n    the darkness, and the Gods called the light day, and the darkness\r\n    they called night. * * * * *\r\n\r\n    25. And the Gods also said let there be an expanse in the midst of\r\n    the waters, and it shall divide the waters from the waters. And the\r\n    Gods ordered the expanse, so that it divided the waters which were\r\n    under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse: and\r\n    it was so, even as they ordered. And the Gods called the expanse\r\n    heaven. * * *\r\n\r\n    26. And the Gods ordered, saying, let the waters under the heavens\r\n    be gathered unto one place, and let the earth come up dry, and it\r\n    was so, as they ordered; and the Gods pronounced the earth dry.\"\r\n\r\nThus it continues unto the end of the 32nd verse in each verse\r\ndeclaring that the formation of the earth was done under the direction\r\nof the Gods. This agrees admirably with the discourses delivered at\r\nNauvoo in 1844, previously quoted. Is it true doctrine? It certainly\r\nwas taught by Joseph Smith, so in accepting it, we are not so far out\r\nof harmony with his teachings on this subject as our enemies have\r\nstated. Here again we hear another objection from our Reorganite\r\nbrethren. Say they: \"This _Book of Abraham_ was never accepted by the\r\nChurch in the Prophet's day as doctrine and it has not been so accepted\r\nby us; it is not a part of 'our authorized doctrines and deeds,'\r\ntherefore it is not binding on us.\" Perhaps so, you may not have\r\naccepted it. That does not destroy the truth of this doctrine, which\r\nthe Prophet Joseph Smith and the Church in his day _did accept_--the\r\nDoctrine of plurality of Gods. Do you deny this? If so then you deny\r\nthe revelations of God given through the Seer and _you_ are out of\r\nharmony with the revelations given through that man. The Bible and\r\nthe Doctrine and Covenants both have been received as the law of the\r\nChurch, and these sacred books both teach the doctrine of plurality\r\nof Gods. First as to the Bible: I quote in each instance from the\r\n\"Inspired Translation.\"\r\n\r\n    \"For the Lord your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great\r\n    God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not persons, nor\r\n    taketh reward.\"--(Deut. 10:17).\r\n\r\n    Joshua says: \"The Lord God of gods, the Lord God of gods, he\r\n    knoweth, and Israel he shall know.\"--(Josh. 22:22).\r\n\r\n    David the Psalmist says: \"Oh give thanks unto the Lord; for He is\r\n    good; for His mercy endureth forever.\r\n\r\n    \"Oh give thanks unto the God of gods; for His mercy endureth\r\n    forever.\r\n\r\n    \"Oh give thanks to the Lord of lords, for His mercy endureth\r\n    forever.\"--(Psalm 136:1-3).\r\n\r\n    Again he says in the 138th Psalm: \"I will praise Thee with my whole\r\n    heart; before the gods, will sing praise unto Thee.\"\r\n\r\nBut you say these were the heathen gods? but that will never do, surely\r\nthe Lord is not the chief God of the heathen gods. Perhaps we may\r\ndiscover more light on the subject.\r\n\r\n    Again the Psalmist sings: \"God standeth in the congregation of the\r\n    mighty; he judgeth among the gods. * * * I have said ye are gods;\r\n    and all of you are children of the Most High.\"\r\n\r\nSay what you will of the other passages, but of this you must admit\r\nthat the heathen gods are not mentioned, for this truth received the\r\ndivine approval of the Redeemer Himself as He taught the apostate Jew:\r\nHear Him:\r\n\r\n    \"I and my Father are one.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shown you from my\r\n    Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?\r\n\r\n    \"The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not;\r\n    but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, maketh\r\n    thyself God.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are\r\n    gods?\r\n\r\n    \"If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, _and the\r\n    Scriptures cannot be broken_;\r\n\r\n    \"Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the\r\n    world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?\"\r\n\r\nAnd the Jews were shocked, just as a Reorganite minister is, with this\r\ndoctrine of plurality of Gods, and they sought the life of the Savior,\r\nbut He was delivered out of their midst.\r\n\r\nThe Apostle John in his First Epistle and third chapter also teaches\r\nthis doctrine:\r\n\r\n    \"Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that\r\n    we should be called the sons of God; therefore _the world knoweth\r\n    us not_, because it knew him not.\r\n\r\n    \"Beloved, _now are we the sons of God_, and _it doth not yet appear\r\n    what we shall be_; but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall\r\n    be like him; for we shall see him as he is.\"\r\n\r\nIf the faithful, who keep the commandments of the Father are _His\r\nsons_, then they are heirs of the kingdom and shall receive of the\r\nfulnesss of the Father's glory, even until they become like Father. And\r\nhow can they be perfect as their Father in heaven is perfect if they\r\nare not like Him?\r\n\r\nIn the revelations given to Joseph which were accepted by the Church\r\nbefore 1844, the doctrine of plurality of Gods is also taught. From the\r\n\"Vision\" one of the grandest revelations ever given to man, I quote the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n    \"And again, we bear record for we saw and heard, and this is the\r\n    testimony of the Gospel of Christ, concerning them who come forth\r\n    in the resurrection of the just: They are they who received the\r\n    testimony of Jesus, and believed on His name, and were baptized\r\n    after the manner of His burial, being buried in the water in His\r\n    name, and this according to the commandment which He has given,\r\n    that by keeping the commandments, they might be washed and cleansed\r\n    from all their sins, and receive the Holy Spirit by the laying on\r\n    of the hands of him who is ordained and sealed unto this power:\r\n    and who overcome by faith, and are sealed by the Holy Spirit of\r\n    promise, which the Father sheds forth upon all those who are just\r\n    and true; they are they who are the Church of the firstborn; they\r\n    are they into whose hands the Father has given all things; they are\r\n    they who are priests and kings, who have received of His fulnesss,\r\n    and of His glory, and are priests of the Most High after the order\r\n    of Melchizedek, which was after the order of Enoch, which was after\r\n    the order of the Only Begotten Son; wherefore, as it is written,\r\n    they are gods, even the sons of God; wherefore all things are\r\n    theirs, whether life or death, or things present, or things to\r\n    come, all are theirs, and they are Christ's and Christ is God's\r\n    and they shall overcome all things.\"--(D. & C., Sec. 76:50-60.\r\n    Reorganite edition, 76:5).\r\n\r\nHow could this doctrine be stated plainer? This is the doctrine taught\r\nby the Savior to the Jews, by David in his psalms and by others of\r\nthe prophets. Here it is stated emphatically that they who are of the\r\nChurch of the Firstborn (i. e., those who keep the whole law) even\r\n\"_as it is written, they are gods_, even the sons of God!\" Where is it\r\nwritten? In this section; and in the words of the Savior wherein He\r\nsays, referring to David's Psalm, \"_the Scriptures cannot be broken_\"\r\n(John 10:34-36). Doesn't this teach plainly the doctrine of plurality\r\nof Gods? Does it not teach the fact that the children shall, through\r\nobedience, sometime obtain the exaltation of the Gods themselves? If\r\nnot what does it mean? Even a Reorganite dare not argue that these are\r\nthe heathen gods!\r\n\r\nNow, if they overcome _all things, then_ there _are not some things_\r\nthat they do not overcome. If these are to receive \"of His fulnesss\r\nand of His glory, and if into their 'hands the Father has _given all\r\nthings_, then the Father _has not withheld_ some of the fulnesss of\r\nHis glory, or _some things_. And if they receive His fulnesss and His\r\nglory, and if _all things_ are theirs, whether life or death, or things\r\npresent, or things to come, _all are theirs_,\" how can they receive\r\nthese blessings and not become Gods? They cannot. Yet this is doctrine\r\nreceived by the Church and taught by Joseph Smith the Seer.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of this same subject in the revelation on Priesthood (Sec.\r\n84:35-40. Reorganite edition, 83:6) the Lord says:\r\n\r\n    \"And also all they who receive this priesthood receiveth me, saith\r\n    the Lord, for he that receiveth my servants receiveth me, and he\r\n    that receiveth me receiveth my Father, and he that receiveth my\r\n    Father receiveth my Father's kingdom. Therefore, _all that my\r\n    Father hath_ shall be given unto him; and this is according to the\r\n    oath and covenant which belongeth to the priesthood.[1] Therefore,\r\n    all those who receiveth the priesthood receiveth this oath and\r\n    covenant of my Father, _which He cannot break, neither can it be\r\n    moved_; but whoso breaketh this covenant, after he hath received\r\n    it, and altogether turneth therefrom, shall not have forgiveness of\r\n    sins in this world nor in the world to come.\"\r\n\r\nHere again we are given to understand that those who are faithful in\r\nobtaining the priesthood and magnifying their calling that they become\r\nof the Church of the Firstborn, receiving ALL THAT THE FATHER HATH!\r\nand this according to an oath and covenant that cannot be broken. Now,\r\nagain, how are they to receive _all that the Father hath_, if something\r\nis withheld? And if something is not withheld, how can they receive all\r\nthat He hath and not become as He is, that is, Gods themselves?\r\n\r\nHere is another revelation given to the Prophet December 27, 1832. This\r\nis section 88 and verses 106-7 (Reorganite edition, 85:33):\r\n\r\n    \"And again, another angel shall sound his trump, which is the\r\n    seventh angel, saying, It is finished! It is finished! the Lamb\r\n    of God hath overcome and trodden the wine-press alone; even the\r\n    wine-press of the fierceness of the wrath of Almighty God; And\r\n    then shall the angels be crowned with the glory of His might,\r\n    and the saints shall be filled with His glory, and receive their\r\n    inheritance and be _made equal with Him_\" (i. e., with Christ).\r\n\r\nHow can the Saints receive of His fulnesss and be _equal_ with the Lord\r\nand not be as He is, that is Gods? This is not the doctrine of Brigham\r\nYoung (for then in the eyes of Reorganites it would be blasphemy),\r\nbut these are the revelations of the Lord to Joseph Smith. And these\r\nrevelations have been received by the \"Reorganized\" Church as binding\r\non them, yet they do not accept the truth these revelations contain.\r\nTherefore, they prove themselves to be those who have departed from the\r\nteachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith.\r\n\r\n\r\nADAM.\r\n\r\nA word now, in relation to Adam. If all those, _as it is written--and\r\nthe Scriptures cannot be broken_--are Gods unto whom the word of God\r\ncame, and they are to receive all things, even the fulnesss of the\r\nFather's glory and be made equal with him, will not Father Adam be\r\nincluded among them? What do the Scriptures say of _him_?\r\n\r\nIn section 27 of the Doctrine and Covenants he is called, Michael, or\r\nAdam, the _father of all, the prince of all_, the \"ancient of days.\"\r\n\r\n    In section 107:54-55: \"And the Lord appeared unto them, and they\r\n    rose up and blessed Adam, and called him Michael, the Prince, the\r\n    Archangel,\r\n\r\n    \"And the Lord administered comfort unto Adam, and said unto him, _I\r\n    have set thee to be at the head_--a multitude of nations shall come\r\n    of thee, and _thou art a prince over them forever_.\" Section 78:16:\r\n    \"Who hath appointed Michael your prince, and established his feet,\r\n    and _set him upon high, and given unto him the keys of Salvation\r\n    under the counsel and direction of the Holy One_, who is without\r\n    beginning of days or end of life.\"\r\n\r\nThese expressions are from the revelations to Joseph Smith, Brigham\r\nYoung did not receive them, although he accepted them.\r\n\r\nThis is what the Prophet said in a discourse in 1839:\r\n\r\n    \"The Priesthood was first given to Adam, he obtained the First\r\n    Presidency, and held the keys of it from generation to generation.\r\n    He obtained it in the Creation, before the world was formed, as\r\n    in Gen. 1:26, 27, 28. He had dominion given him over every living\r\n    creature. He is Michael, the Archangel spoken of in the Scriptures.\r\n    * * * * The Priesthood is an everlasting principle, and existed\r\n    with God from eternity, and will to eternity, without beginning\r\n    of days or end of years. The keys have to be brought from heaven\r\n    whenever the Gospel is sent. When they are revealed from heaven,\r\n    _it is by Adam's authority_. (My italics.)\r\n\r\n    \"Daniel in his seventh chapter speaks of the Ancient of Days; he\r\n    means the oldest man, our Father Adam, Michael, he will call his\r\n    children together and hold a council with them to prepare them for\r\n    the coming of the Son of Man. He (Adam) is the father of the human\r\n    family, and presides over the spirits of all men, and all that have\r\n    had the keys must stand before him in this grand council. This may\r\n    take place before some of us leave this stage of action. The Son of\r\n    Man stands before him, and there is given him glory and dominion.\r\n    Adam delivers up his stewardship to Christ, that which was\r\n    delivered to him as holding the keys of the universe, but retains\r\n    his standing as head of the human family.--(History of the Church,\r\n    Vol. 3:385-7. See also Vol. 4:207-9.)\r\n\r\nNow, if all the Saints who become members of the Church of the\r\nFirstborn are to become Gods--_and the Scriptures cannot be\r\nbroken_--through the fulnesss of the Father's glory which they are to\r\nreceive after they are \"made equal with Him,\" will not Adam, who is\r\nappointed \"_to be at the head_\" as \"a prince over them forever,\" be one\r\nof them? And as one of them he shall hold the scepter of power and rule\r\nover them under the direction of the Holy One of Israel, and they shall\r\nbe in subjection to him forever.\r\n\r\nThis was taught by Joseph Smith, and in departing from it, the\r\n\"Reorganized\" Church has denied the revelations and teachings of the\r\nLord.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ONLY BEGOTTEN OF THE FATHER.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this subject, Reorganites also claim that Brigham\r\nYoung went astray and apostatized because he declared that Jesus\r\nChrist was not begotten of the Holy Ghost. Reorganites claim that He\r\nwas begotten of the Holy Ghost, and they make the statement that the\r\nScriptures so teach. But they do err not understanding the Scriptures.\r\nThey tell us the Book of Mormon states that Jesus was begotten of the\r\nHoly Ghost. I challenge the statement; the Book of Mormon teaches no\r\nsuch thing! Neither does the Bible. It is true there is one passage\r\nthat states so but we must consider it in the light of other passages\r\nwith which it is in conflict. The Book of Mormon says:\r\n\r\n    \"And behold, He shall be born of Mary at Jerusalem * * she being a\r\n    virgin, a precious and chosen vessel, who shall be overshadowed,\r\n    and conceive _by the power_ of the Holy Ghost.\"\r\n\r\nWith this Luke agrees:\r\n\r\n    \"Then said Mary unto the angel; How can this be?\r\n\r\n    \"And the angel answered and said unto her, of the Holy Ghost,\r\n    and _the power of the Highest_. Therefore also, that holy child\r\n    that shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.--Luke\r\n    1:34-35).\r\n\r\nIn Matthew it reads \"of the Holy Ghost\" which evidently means \"power of\r\nthe Holy Ghost,\" to agree with the Book of Mormon and with Luke.\r\n\r\nIf Reorganites are correct then Jesus is not the Only Begotten Son of\r\nthe Father, but the Son of the Holy Ghost. This will not do for it\r\nconflicts with the Scriptures. The Prophet taught that the Father,\r\nSon and Holy Ghost were three separate personages, and that Jesus was\r\nthe Only Begotten of the Father. In the Book of Genesis, (Inspired\r\nScriptures) Jesus is spoken of throughout as the _Only Begotten of\r\nthe Father_ not less than _twelve_ times and in the Book of Mormon\r\nat least five times and a great number of times in the Doctrine and\r\nCovenants (see section 76:23, 25, 35, 57) and in these Scriptures He is\r\nspoken of as the Son of God innumerable times. Now, if He is the _Only\r\nBegotten_ of the Father in the flesh, He must be the Son of the Father\r\nand not the Son of the Holy Ghost. Yet, to be consistent, Reorganites\r\nmust claim that Jesus is the Son of the Holy Ghost and not the Son of\r\nGod the Father. Their alternative--if it can be called such--must be,\r\nthen, the stand of Mr. William H. Kelley, the \"president\" of their\r\n\"apostles,\" who in a written statement in answer to the question put to\r\nhim by the writer, September 10, 1903: \"You say that Jesus Christ the\r\nSon of God was begotten of the Holy Ghost. Is He the Son of the Holy\r\nGhost?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Kelley signed his answer as follows: \"_I do not know_. Wm. H.\r\nKelley.\"\r\n\r\nJust think of this for a moment. Here is a man professing to be the\r\nChief of the Special Witnesses for Christ, declaring that he does not\r\nknow whether Jesus is the Son of God the Father or the Son of the Holy\r\nGhost. And the Savior declared it so plainly that He was the Son of\r\nthe Father, His Only Begotten, and was so acknowledged by the Father\r\nthroughout the Scriptures. \"And this is life eternal, that they might\r\nknow Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent.\"\r\nJohn 17:3. Again we prove that _they_ have departed from the Scriptures\r\nand the teachings and revelations of the Prophet Joseph Smith. Why do\r\nthey make this error? Because they do not understand the Scriptures and\r\nfail to recognize the fact that all things that the Father doeth are\r\ndone by the _power of the Holy Ghost_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARRIAGE.\r\n\r\nThe question of Celestial (including plural) marriage is treated quite\r\nextensively in _Blood Atonement and the Origin of Plural Marriage_ so\r\nit will be passed with a brief notice here.\r\n\r\nWe maintain with abundant authority that Joseph Smith the Prophet\r\nintroduced Celestial Marriage, that is, marriage for eternity, into\r\nthe Church. This fact has been admitted by many members of the\r\n\"Reorganized\" Church, notwithstanding they attack us on this doctrine\r\nand say it is not a doctrine of the Church. And while they attack us\r\nthe better part of them hope it is true. What is there so terrible in\r\nthe doctrine of the preservation of the family union in eternity? What\r\nright-living God-fearing man is there but would be glad to meet his\r\nparents, his wife and children, in the kingdom of God and know they\r\nwere united never again to separate? While this belief is not taught\r\nin the creeds of men--including the Reorganites--yet there is a hope\r\nburning in the bosoms of many people that this doctrine _may_ prove\r\ntrue!\r\n\r\nWell, it is a Scriptural doctrine, and it _is_ true, for the Lord\r\nrevealed it to Joseph Smith. In the beginning, the very first marriage\r\nwas one intended to last forever. Do you not believe it? I quote from\r\nthe Inspired Scriptures:\r\n\r\n    \"And I, God, created man _in mine own image_, in the image of mine\r\n    Only Begotten created I him, _male and female created I them_,\r\n    And I, God, blessed them, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and\r\n    multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion\r\n    over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over\r\n    every living thing that moveth upon the earth.\"--(Genesis 1:29-30).\r\n\r\nThis was a spiritual creation, man was created in the image of God,\r\n_male and female_, first in the Spirit, and told in that spiritual\r\ncreation that they were expected to multiply and replenish the earth\r\nwhen they were placed upon it to subdue it. This we prove from the\r\nsecond chapter of Genesis beginning with the fifth verse:\r\n\r\n    \"For I, the Lord God, created all things of which I have spoken\r\n    _spiritually_, before they were naturally upon the face of the\r\n    earth; for I, the Lord God, had not caused it to rain upon the face\r\n    of the earth.\r\n\r\n    \"And I, the Lord God, had created all the children of men, and\r\n    not yet a man to till the ground, for in heaven created I them,\r\n    and there was not yet flesh upon the earth, neither in the water,\r\n    neither in the air.\"\r\n\r\n    Verse 23. \"And I, the Lord God, said unto mine Only Begotten, that\r\n    it was not good that the man should be alone;\r\n\r\n    \"Wherefore, I will make an help meet for him.\"\r\n\r\nHere the Lord declares that it is not good for man to be alone, and\r\ntherefore he gave him an helpmeet, Eve; and this union was formed\r\nbefore _mortality or death came into the world_, and there is no\r\nindication that it was meant to have an end. If, therefore, it was not\r\ngood for man to be alone before the days of mortality, will it not also\r\nbe good for man to have a helpmeet _after_ mortality has passed away?\r\nPaul thought so, said he: \"Nevertheless neither is the man without the\r\nwoman, neither the woman without the man, _in the Lord_.\"--(I Cor.\r\n11:11).\r\n\r\nAlexender H. Smith, \"Patriarch\" of the \"Reorganized\" Church, in a\r\ndiscourse that is very excellent in many respects, delivered July 1,\r\n1903, and published in \"Zion's Ensign\" of December 31, 1903, taught\r\nthe eternity of the marriage covenant as strongly and emphatically as\r\nit could have been done by an Elder of the Church of Jesus Christ of\r\nLatter-day Saints. The subject of the discourse was: \"In My Father's\r\nhouse are many mansions,\" after enlarging upon the theme for some time,\r\nhe concludes his discourse with some personal testimony regarding the\r\nlast illness of his mother from which the following extracts are here\r\nproduced:\r\n\r\n    \"Pretty son the still, small voice of the Spirit said, \"If your\r\n    mother dies _she will be with her companion, Joseph_. If she lives\r\n    she cannot but live a few short years at most of pain and anguish.\"\r\n\r\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\n    \"Just before she passed away she called, 'Joseph, Joseph,' I\r\n    thought she meant my brother. He was in the room, and I spoke to\r\n    him, and said, Joseph, mother wants you. I was at the head of the\r\n    bed. My mother raised right up, lifted her left hand as high as she\r\n    could raise it, and called, Joseph. I put my left arm under her\r\n    shoulders, took her hand in mine, saying, Mother, what is it, laid\r\n    her hand on her bosom, and she was dead; she had passed away.\r\n\r\n    \"And when I talked of her calling, Sr. Revel, who was with us\r\n    during our sickness, said, Don't you understand that? No, I\r\n    replied, I do not. Well, a short time before she died she had a\r\n    vision which she related to me. She said that your father came to\r\n    her and said to her, Emma, come with me, it is time for you to come\r\n    with me. And as she related it she said, I put on my bonnet and\r\n    my shawl and went with him; I did not think that it was anything\r\n    unusual. I went with him into a mansion, a beautiful mansion, and\r\n    he showed me through the different apartments of that beautiful\r\n    mansion. And one room was the nursery. In that nursery was a babe\r\n    in the cradle. She said, I knew my babe, my Don Carlos that was\r\n    taken away from me. She sprang forward, caught the child up in her\r\n    arms, and wept with joy over the child. When she recovered herself\r\n    sufficiently she turned to Joseph, and said. Where are the rest of\r\n    my children? He said to her, Emma, be patient, and you shall have\r\n    all of your children.\"\r\n\r\nThen Alexander comments:\r\n\r\n    \"Do you wonder why, as a son of that mother, I plead for those who\r\n    believe upon the Lord Jesus Christ, and picture their beautiful\r\n    home in the city of God, in the language that I do, when I realize\r\n    that my mother occupies, or will occupy one of those beautiful\r\n    mansions? _It may be imagination; but it is grand_; it fills me\r\n    with a grand hope.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so they do hope, notwithstanding the fact that they oppose us in\r\nthis doctrine, and say that there is no union of parents and children\r\nin family union after death. They secretly hope, and pray in their very\r\nhearts, that after all in this we _may_ be right.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLOOD ATONEMENT.\r\n\r\nThis subject is also found in _Blood Atonement and the Origin of Plural\r\nMarriage_, therefore only a brief outline will be given here. Joseph\r\nSmith taught that there were certain sins so grievous that man may\r\ncommit, that will place the transgressors beyond the power of the\r\natonement of Christ. If these offenses are committed, then the blood of\r\nChrist will not cleanse them from their sins even though they repent.\r\nTherefore their only hope is to have their own blood shed to _atone_,\r\nas far as possible, in their behalf. This is Scriptural doctrine, and\r\nis taught in all the standard works of the Church. The doctrine was\r\nestablished in the beginning, that \"Whoso sheddeth man's blood, _by man\r\nshall his_ blood shed to _atone_ as far as possible, in their behalf.\r\nFor a commandment I give, that every man's brother shall preserve the\r\nlife of man, for in mine own image have I made man.\"--(Genesis 9:12-13,\r\nInspired Scriptures).\r\n\r\nThis was the law among the Nephites: \"Wo unto the murderer, who\r\ndeliberately killeth, _for he shall die_.\"--(II Nephi 9:35).\r\n\r\nJohn says: \"If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto\r\ndeath, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not\r\nunto death. _There is a sin unto death_: I do not say that ye shall\r\npray for it.\"\r\n\r\nEvery nation since the world began has practiced blood atonement at\r\nleast in part as that doctrine is based upon the Scriptures. And men\r\nfor certain crimes have had to _atone_ for their sins wherein they have\r\nplaced themselves beyond the redeeming power of the blood of Christ.\r\n\r\nBut that the Church practices \"Blood Atonement\" on apostates or any\r\nothers, which is preached by ministers of the \"Reorganization\" is a\r\ndamnable falsehood for which the accusers must answer.\r\n\r\n\r\nZION.\r\n\r\nMembers of the \"Reorganized\" Church inform us that Zion does not\r\ninclude Utah,[2] but is limited to Jackson County, Mo., and the regions\r\nround about, Nauvoo being one of the \"corner stones;\" and when the\r\nSaints came westward they left the borders of Zion. Moreover, since\r\nTemples were to be built in Zion and Jerusalem, all the Temples we may\r\nbuild in Utah or the West are not recognized of the Lord on this ground\r\nalone, if no other.\r\n\r\nWe accept the fact that the center place where the City New Jerusalem\r\nis to be built, is in Jackson Country, Missouri. It was never the\r\nintention to substitute Utah or any other place for Jackson Country.\r\nBut we do hold that Zion when reference is made to the land, is as\r\nbroad as America, both North and South--all of it is Zion. If Zion is\r\nlimited in its scope to the country surrounding Jackson County, it\r\nis indeed too bad that Nephi did not know that fact. What a glorious\r\nthing it would have been had there been a few Reorganites in his day\r\nto inform him of it. Then he and his people would not have fallen into\r\nthe error of building Temples--like unto Solomon's at Jerusalem--away\r\noff down in Central or South America, but they could have placed one\r\nin Jackson Country, or the regions round about. It was really an\r\nunfortunate occurrence.\r\n\r\nBut to be serious. The Book of Mormon informs us that the whole of\r\nAmerica, both North and South, is a choice land above all other lands,\r\nin other words--Zion. The Lord told the Jaredites that He would lead\r\nthem to a land \"which is choice above all the land of the earth.\"\r\n(Ether 1:42). We understand that they landed in Central America where\r\ntheir kingdom existed the greater part of their residence in America.\r\nWhen the Lord led the family of Lehi to this land, He said to them:\r\n\"And inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall prosper,\r\nand shall be led to a land of promise; yea, even a land which I have\r\nprepared for you; yea, a land which is choice above all other lands.\"\r\n(I. Nephi, 2:20). It is generally understood that they landed in South\r\nAmerica, and that their nations, the Nephites and Lamanites, dwelt in\r\nSouth and Central America during the greater part of their sojourn\r\nhere. At any rate, the time of their civilization was principally spent\r\nin the South and not in the region now comprising the United States.\r\nThis proves beyond the possibility of doubt that the choice land was\r\nSouth as well as North America, and while the City New Jerusalem, which\r\nthe Book of Mormon tells us is to be built on this land that is choice\r\nabove all other lands, will be in Jackson County, nevertheless, if one\r\naccepts the Book of Mormon, one must accept the whole hemisphere as the\r\nland of Zion.\r\n\r\nAt the April conference of the Church, held at Nauvoo in 1844, the\r\nProphet Joseph Smith declared that the whole of America was Zion. (See\r\nMill. Star, 23:280). His remarks are recorded in the _Life of Joseph\r\nthe Prophet_ (Reorganite edition, page 503) as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"But in the mighty sweep of the crowning sermons of his life we\r\n    must not overlook the more miscellaneous gems and striking sayings.\r\n    Here is one for America, like the sound of an archangel's trump:\r\n\r\n    \"I want to make a proclamation to the Elders. You know very well\r\n    that the Lord has led this Church by revelation. I have now another\r\n    revelation--a grand and glorious revelation. I shall not be able to\r\n    dwell as largely upon it as at some other time, but I will give you\r\n    the first principles. You know there has been a great discussion\r\n    in relation to Zion, where it is, and where the gathering of the\r\n    dispensation is, which I am now going to tell you. The Prophets\r\n    have spoken and written upon it, but I will make a proclamation\r\n    that will cover a broader ground. _The whole of America is Zion\r\n    itself_, from north to south, and is described by the Prophets,\r\n    who declared that it is the Zion, where the mountain of the Lord\r\n    should be, and that it should be in the centre of the land. When\r\n    the Elders will take up and examine the old prophecies in the Bible\r\n    they will see it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"AN ESOTERIC GOSPEL.\"\r\n\r\nAnother charge is that after the death of Joseph and Hyrum Smith,\r\nPresident Young and the Apostles introduced secrets into the Church,\r\nthat they claimed to hold \"_keys that the written word never spoke\r\nof, nor never will_.\" (True Succession, p. 122). All this, say they,\r\nis contrary to the Gospel of Jesus Christ and to the teachings of\r\nJoseph Smith, who always taught openly and not in secret. One of their\r\ndefenders writing on this point quotes from the Redeemer as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in\r\n    the synagogue, and in the temple, wither the Jews always resort;\r\n    _and in secret have I said nothing_. Why ask thou me? ask them:\r\n    behold they know what I said.\" (John 18:18-21.)\r\n\r\n    \"But Brigham was afraid that people would ask his followers what he\r\n    taught. In speaking of some who wanted their endowments, he says:\r\n    'Well, he gets his endowment, and what for? To go to California,\r\n    and _reveal everything he can_, and stir up wickedness, and prepare\r\n    himself for hell.\" (Journal of Discourses, 2: 144).\r\n\r\n    \"Christ was not afraid of any revealments. He stood there among\r\n    His enemies, defying them to find any fault with His teachings;\r\n    but Brigham was afraid of what his followers might reveal of his\r\n    doctrine and secret works. Did he represent Christ?\" (Necessity for\r\n    a Reorganization, p. 30).\r\n\r\nYes, Jesus taught the Gospel openly as far as the Jews were able to\r\nstand it; but it does not follow that he did not teach His disciples\r\nthings that were not for the world! And at times He was constrained by\r\nHis Father from teaching His disciples some truths. Why? Because of the\r\nhardness of their hearts they were not able to receive His teachings.\r\nIn not revealing everything to the world, did Brigham Young,--aye, did\r\nJoseph Smith represent Christ? for Brigham Young was only following in\r\nthe footsteps of the Seer! What was it the Savior said to Peter, James,\r\nand John, when they came down from the mount of transfiguration? Jesus\r\ncharged them, saying, \"Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of Man\r\nbe risen again from the dead.\"--Matt. 17:8. (Inspired Scriptures) Why\r\ndidn't he tell them to proclaim it openly from the housetops? Because\r\nit was not for the world! Jesus was in the habit of teaching the people\r\nin parables. On one occasion when He had thus spoken, His disciples\r\ncame and said unto him:\r\n\r\n    \"Why speakest Thou unto them in parables? He answered and said unto\r\n    them, _Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the\r\n    kingdom of heaven_, but _to them_ it is not given. For whosoever\r\n    receiveth, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance;\r\n    but whosoever continueth not to receive, from him _shall be taken\r\n    away even that he hath_. Therefore speak I to them in parables;\r\n    because they, seeing, see not; and hearing, they hear not; neither\r\n    do they understand.\" (Matt. 13:8-12).\r\n\r\nOn another occasion Jesus said unto His disciples: \"And other sheep\r\nI have, which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they\r\nshall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.\"\r\n(John 10:16). But He did not tell them who those \"other sheep\" were.\r\nThe reason He failed to tell them this interesting fact we learn from\r\nthe Book of Mormon:\r\n\r\n    \"And now it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words,\r\n    He said unto those Twelve whom He had chosen, ye are my disciples;\r\n    and ye are a light unto this people, who are a remnant of the\r\n    house of Joseph. And behold, this is the land of your inheritance;\r\n    and the Father hath given it unto you. And not at any time hath\r\n    the Father given me commandment that I should tell it unto your\r\n    brethren at Jerusalem; neither at any time hath the Father given\r\n    me commandment, that I should tell unto them concerning the other\r\n    tribes of the house of Israel, whom the Father hath led away out\r\n    of the land. This much did the Father command me, that I should\r\n    tell unto them. That other sheep I have, which are not of this\r\n    fold; them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice, and\r\n    there shall be one fold, and one shepherd. And now, _because\r\n    of stiffneckedness and unbelief, they understood not my word:\r\n    therefore I was commanded to say no more of the Father concerning\r\n    this thing unto them_.\" (III. Nephi, 15:11-17).\r\n\r\nHow different this is from Reorganite philosophy, according to their\r\nrule of faith, Jesus should have spoken boldly and openly and should\r\nnot have withheld anything. Was Jesus \"_afraid_ of any revealments?\"\r\n\r\nPaul says he knew a man, whether in the body, or out of the body, he\r\ncould not tell, \"How that he was caught up into paradise, and _heard\r\nunspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter_.\" What\r\nmade the words unlawful to utter to man? simply because in the hardness\r\nof his heart and unbelief, man was not worthy to hear them, he could\r\nnot endure them.\r\n\r\nThe Book of Mormon is most emphatic on this point that there are\r\n\"mysteries\" that are not to be revealed to the unfaithful. This is from\r\nthe Prophet Alma:\r\n\r\n    \"And now Alma began to expound these things unto him, (Zeezrom),\r\n    saying, It is given unto many _to know the mysteries_ of God;\r\n    _nevertheless they are laid under a strict command, that they shall\r\n    not impart only according to the portion of His word, which He doth\r\n    grant unto the children of men; according to the heed and diligence\r\n    which they give unto Him_; and therefore he that will harden his\r\n    heart, the same receiveth the lesser portion of the word; and he\r\n    that will not harden his heart, to him is given the greater portion\r\n    of the word, _until he know them in full_; and they that will\r\n    harden their hearts, to them is given the _lesser portion_ of the\r\n    word, _until they know nothing concerning his mysteries_; and then\r\n    they are taken captive by the devil, and led by his will down to\r\n    destruction. Now, this is what is meant by the chains of hell.\"\r\n\r\nIt is because Reorganites have hardened their hearts that they have\r\nnot received the _greater portion_ of the word, even the mysteries,\r\nand therefore they are, through their hard-heartedness and unbelief,\r\ncaptives of the devil and in danger of the chains of hell.\r\n\r\nIf the Lord places His servants under a strict command _not to reveal_\r\nHis word, \"only according to the portion of His word, which He doth\r\ngrant unto the children of men, according to the heed and diligence\r\nwhich they give unto Him;\" and, therefore, they withhold some of those\r\nthings from the world that have been revealed unto them does that make\r\nthem _cowardly_? If so, not only Brigham Young, but Joseph Smith, yes,\r\neven the Son of Man Himself would be cowardly. No, the fact that they\r\nhave refused to do this thing proves them to possess the greatest\r\ncourage, for it has caused them to face persecutions, even death.\r\n\r\nWe are told that the Book of Mormon contains the fulnesss of the\r\nGospel, yet the greater parts of the teachings of the Savior to that\r\npeople are not yet revealed, because of the unbelief of the people.\r\nThis is from III. Nephi, 26th chapter:\r\n\r\n    \"And now there cannot be written in this book even a hundredth part\r\n    of the teachings which Jesus did truly teach unto the people; but\r\n    behold the plates of Nephi do contain the more part of the things\r\n    which He taught the people; and these things have I written, which\r\n    are a _lesser part_ of the things which He taught the people; and I\r\n    have written them to the intent that they may be brought again unto\r\n    this people, from the Gentiles, according to the words which Jesus\r\n    hath spoken.\r\n\r\n    \"And when they shall have received this, which is expedient that\r\n    they should have first, _to try their faith_, and if it shall so\r\n    be that they shall believe these things, then shall the _greater\r\n    things_ be made manifest unto them. And if it so be that they will\r\n    not believe these things, then shall the greater things be withheld\r\n    from them, _unto their condemnation_. Behold I was about to write\r\n    them all which were engraven upon the plates of Nephi, _but the\r\n    Lord forbid it, saying, I will try the faith of my people_.\"\r\n    (Verses 6-11).\r\n\r\nThe calling of Brigham Young a coward for withholding some things that\r\nthe Lord has revealed to His Church, may be excused because of the\r\nignorance of the accusers; but who dare presume to say the Lord was\r\ncowardly because He withheld the greater things from His people? And\r\nyet if you have done it unto one of His servants ye have done it unto\r\nHim.\r\n\r\nAgain:\r\n\r\n    \"Behold, I have written upon these plates the very things which\r\n    the brother of Jared saw: and there never was greater things made\r\n    manifest, than that which was made manifest unto the brother of\r\n    Jared; wherefore the Lord hath commanded me to write them; and I\r\n    have written them. And He commanded me that I should seal them up;\r\n    and He also hath commanded that I should seal up the interpretation\r\n    thereof; wherefore I have sealed up the interpreters, according to\r\n    the commandment of the Lord. For the Lord said unto me, They shall\r\n    not go forth unto the Gentiles until the day that they shall repent\r\n    of their iniquity, and become clean before the Lord.\" (Ether 4:4-6).\r\n\r\nJoseph the Prophet was commanded to keep some things from going out\r\ninto the world that had been revealed unto him and the Church. He also\r\nreceived revelations that he could not teach to the Church in the\r\nbeginning, no more than Jesus could teach all things to His disciples.\r\nWhen he did reveal some of the \"mysteries\" there were many who left Him\r\nand denied the faith, just as they did when Jesus told His disciples He\r\nwas the bread of life (John 6:66). \"Many of them went back and walked\r\nno more with Him.\" The Prophet said at Kirtland, April 6, 1837: \"If the\r\nChurch knew all the commandments, one half they would condemn through\r\nprejudice and ignorance. (Hist. of Church, Vol. 2:477). A great many\r\ndid fall away at that time, not being able to endure, and among them\r\nwere the Witnesses of the Book of Mormon, one of whom afterwards set up\r\na church of his own, declaring that Joseph Smith was a fallen Prophet,\r\nand rejecting all his commandments given after about 1835.\r\n\r\nThe Lord gave a revelation to the Prophet, March 7, 1831, at Kirtland\r\n(Sec. 45), in which He revealed many things to take place before His\r\nsecond coming, and at the close of the revelation He said:\r\n\r\n    \"And now I say unto you, _keep these things from going abroad unto\r\n    the world_, until it is expedient in me that ye may accomplish this\r\n    work in the eyes of the people, and in the eyes of your enemies,\r\n    that they may not know your works until ye have accomplished the\r\n    thing which I have commanded you.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Prophet Joseph gave his charge to the first foreign\r\nmissionaries of the Church, Elders Heber C. Kimball, Orson Hyde, Joseph\r\nFielding, and others, he said:\r\n\r\n    \"My instructions to the brethren were, when they arrived in\r\n    England, to adhere closely to the first principles of the Gospel,\r\n    and remain _silent_ concerning the _gathering_, the _vision_, (D. &\r\n    C., Sec. 76), and the _Book of Doctrine and Covenants_, until such\r\n    time as the work was fully established, and it should be clearly\r\n    made manifest by the Spirit to do otherwise. (Hist. of Church,\r\n    2:492).\r\n\r\nWas there anything in the doctrine of _gathering_, in the _vision_,\r\nor the _Doctrine and Covenants_, that Joseph Smith was ashamed of?\r\nWas he \"afraid that people would ask his followers what he taught?\"\r\nthat he gave such a charge to these first foreign missionaries of the\r\nChurch! Was he afraid, a coward? No, he was merely obeying the voice\r\nof the Spirit, for the people were not prepared to receive these\r\nthings. Brigham Young was no more \"afraid that the people would ask his\r\nfollowers what he taught,\" than was Joseph Smith, or even the Master\r\nHimself, when He commanded certain of His disciples to withhold some of\r\nHis teachings from the world, until after His resurrection.\r\n\r\nNow, our Reorganite friends have attempted to make considerable capital\r\nout of the statement of President Brigham Young, that there were \"keys\r\nthat the written word never spoke of, nor never will.\" In the light of\r\nthe facts herein set forth, that \"it is given unto many to _know the\r\nmysteries_ of God; _nevertheless they are laid under a strict command,\r\nthat they shall not impart only according to the portion of His word,\r\nwhich He doth grant unto the children of men_; according to the _heed_\r\nand _diligence_ which they give unto Him, and that things have been\r\nrevealed to the faithful even to babes, that were \"_forbidden_, that\r\nthere should not any man _write them_,\" and that many of them have\r\nseen and heard \"_unspeakable things_, which are _not lawful to be\r\nwritten_,\" (III. Nephi 26:16, 18). is it, after all, so unreasonable\r\nthat there should be _keys_ that the written word _does not and will\r\nnot_ speak of? Joseph Smith the Prophet held the \"_keys_\" of the\r\n_mystery of things which have been sealed_, even things which were from\r\nthe foundation of the world.\" (D. & C. 35:18), which _mysteries_ it was\r\ngiven to the Saints to know, \"but _unto the world_ it is not _given\r\nto know them_.\" (D. & C. 42:65). Again: \"But unto him that keepeth my\r\ncommandments, I will give the mysteries of my kingdom, and the same\r\nshall be in him a well of living water, springing up unto everlasting\r\nlife.\" (D. & C. 63:23).\r\n\r\nNow, how were these _keys_ and _mysteries_ to be kept from the world,\r\nif they were to be published to the world in the written word? And\r\nif the Saints through faithfulness are to receive the _mysteries_\r\nof the kingdom, then they must be withheld from the world and from\r\nthe unfaithful. How is this to be if they are to be published to\r\nthe world in the written word? Therefore, when our friends of the\r\n\"Reorganization\" attack President Young because there were _keys_ not\r\nspoken of in the written word, which keys we have seen were held by\r\nJoseph Smith, they merely display their own ignorance and folly in\r\nraising the question.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEMPLE BUILDING AND CEREMONIAL ENDOWMENTS THEREIN.\r\n\r\nAnother phase of this same subject is Temple work, which is so bitterly\r\nattacked by the Reorganites. They say:\r\n\r\n    \"That as to the alleged 'temple building and ceremonial endowments\r\n    therein,' that we know of no temple building, except as edifices\r\n    wherein to worship God, and no endowment except the endowment of\r\n    the Holy Spirit of the kind experienced by the early Saints on\r\n    Pentecost day.\" (Book of Resolutions, p. 82).\r\n\r\nThey take the ground that the Temple work of the Latter-day Saints is\r\ncontrary to the teachings of the Prophet, and it was not contemplated\r\nbefore the martyrdom that in the Temple of God anything of a secret\r\nnature should take place. Of course it is to be expected that the\r\n\"Reorganization\" knows of \"no Temple building or ceremonial endowments\r\ntherein,\" for they have rejected the \"_greater things_\" and therefore\r\nthe Lord has withheld from them this knowledge \"to their condemnation.\"\r\nThis charge has been already answered in part in what goes before, but\r\nwe will see what is in the revelations to Joseph Smith which justify\r\nstill further the actions of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\r\nSaints in the belief and practice of \"ceremonial endowments,\" etc., in\r\nthe Temples.\r\n\r\nAfter speaking of baptism for the dead in the revelation of January 19,\r\n1841, the Lord continues:\r\n\r\n    \"And again, verily I say unto you, How shall your _washings_ be\r\n    acceptable unto me, except ye perform them in a house which you\r\n    have built to my name? * * * Therefore, verily I say unto you, that\r\n    your _anointings_, and your _washings_, and your baptisms for the\r\n    dead, and your _solemn assemblies_, and your memorials for your\r\n    sacrifices, by the sons of Levi, and for your _oracles in your\r\n    most holy places_, wherein you receive _conversations_, and your\r\n    statutes and judgments, for the beginning of the revelations and\r\n    foundation of Zion, and for her glory, honor, and endowment of\r\n    all her municipals, _are ordained_ by the _ordinance of my holy\r\n    house_ which my people are always commanded to build unto my holy\r\n    name. And verily I say unto you, Let this house be built unto my\r\n    name, that _I may reveal mine ordinances therein, unto my people_.\"\r\n    (Verses 37-40).\r\n\r\nHere are mentioned ordinances that were not had on Pentecost day that\r\nwere to be had in the Lord's Temple, of which our self-confessed\r\nReorganites know nothing, because God has not revealed these things\r\nunto them, and He will not for they have rejected these greater things\r\nto _their own condemnation_.\r\n\r\nIn the Book of Abraham (See Pearl of Great Price) published by the\r\nProphet Joseph Smith in the Times and Seasons in 1842, is given a\r\nfac-similie of hieroglyphics with an accompanying translation by\r\nJoseph Smith, as far as he was permitted to translate. These figures\r\nare numbered from 1 to 20. Here are some of these translations and\r\ncomments of the Prophet: Figure 3.--Is made to represent God, sitting\r\nupon His throne, clothed with power and authority; with a crown of\r\neternal light upon His head; representing also the grand _key-words_ of\r\nthe Holy Priesthood, as revealed to Adam, etc.\" Figure 7.--Represents\r\nGod sitting upon His throne revealing through the heavens, the grand\r\n_key-words_ of the Priesthood, as, also, the sign of the Holy Ghost\r\nunto Abraham, in the form of a dove. Figure 8.--_Contains writing that\r\ncannot be revealed unto the world, but is to be had in the Holy Temple\r\nof God_. Figures 9, 10, 11, the Prophet says \"Ought not to be revealed\r\nat the present time; if the world can find out these numbers, so let it\r\nbe. Amen.\" Figures 12, to 20, \"Will be given in the own due time of the\r\nLord.\" Then the Prophet concludes: \"The above translation is given as\r\nfar as we have any right to give, at the present time.\"\r\n\r\nHere, then, we find things that were to be taught to the Saints in the\r\nTemple of the Lord, but were not to be revealed to the world; for they\r\nare sacred and holy, and can only be had in the Temple of God, for the\r\nLord through Joseph Smith declared it.\r\n\r\nAgain, in verse 28 (see 124), the Lord says: \"For there is not a place\r\nfound on earth that he may come and restore again that which was lost\r\nunto you, or which he hath taken away, even the _fulnesss of the\r\nPriesthood_.\" Therefore, we learn that only in the Temple of the Lord\r\ncan the fulnesss of the Priesthood be received by His people.\r\n\r\nThese facts place our Reorganite brethren in a rather unenviable light,\r\nfor they are opposing through ignorance and unbelief, and the hardness\r\nof their hearts, the revelations of the Lord on Temple work as it was\r\nrevealed to Joseph Smith, and by him to others, and from them to the\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\n\"Hold on,\" say they, \"not so fast, the Lord said He was _about_ to\r\nrestore these things, but it depended on the faithfulness of the\r\nSaints, and Joseph Smith died before the Temple was built, therefore,\r\nsince these things could only be revealed to the people _in the Temple_\r\nthey were not revealed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have any such revelations been received? Name them. Where are they and\r\nwhat are they? Our Doctrine and Covenants contains only two sections\r\nthat were given between that time and the time the Saints left Nauvoo,\r\nand they are not revelations, but letters of Joseph Smith containing\r\nitems of revelation pertaining to baptism for the dead. The Utah\r\nDoctrine and Covenants contains nothing that could be accepted as a\r\nresponse, an answer, to the promise in full.\"[3]\r\n\r\nNow, it's our turn to cry \"Hold on, not so fast.\" We will examine the\r\nword of the Lord: In verse 41 (sec. 124) He says: \"For I deign to\r\nreveal _unto my Church_, things which have been kept hid from before\r\nthe foundation of the world, _things that pertain to the dispensation_\r\nof the fulnesss of times.\" Well, if we were rejected, and _they have\r\nnot received_ the revelations of these things the Lord was _about to\r\nreveal to His Church_, then it stands to reason that _they are not His\r\nChurch_ or they would have received them. For the word of the Lord\r\ncannot be broken. They testify to us that _they have not_ received\r\nthese things.\r\n\r\nIn section 127:8, the Lord again affirms: \"For _I am about to restore\r\nmany things_ to the earth, pertaining to the Priesthood, saith the Lord\r\nof Hosts.\" Yes, He was about to do it, but nearly seventy years have\r\npassed away and the \"Reorganization\" confesses that they have not been\r\nrevealed to them yet! Then they are not the Church! This is obvious.\r\n\r\nElijah said the time had fully come (Sec. 110) and the Prophet said\r\n\"the earth will be smitten with a curse, unless there is a welding link\r\nof some kind or other, between the fathers and the children * * * it\r\nis necessary in the ushering in of the dispensation of the fulnesss\r\nof times * * that a whole and complete and perfect union, and welding\r\ntogether of _dispensations_, and _keys_, and _powers_, and _glories_\r\nshould take place and _be revealed_ from the days of Adam even to the\r\npresent time; and not only this, but those things which _never have\r\nbeen revealed from the foundation of the world_, but have been kept hid\r\nfrom the wise and prudent, shall be revealed unto babes and sucklings\r\nin this the dispensation of the fulnesss of times.\" (Sec. 128:18).\r\n\r\nHere is a point of considerable interest that our friends have\r\noverlooked. The Lord says: \"_And I will show unto my servant Joseph ALL\r\nTHINGS pertaining to this house, and the Priesthood thereof_; and the\r\nplace whereon it shall be built. (Sec. 124:42). Evidently the Lord was\r\ngoing to show him these things before the Temple was built. Did the\r\nLord keep His word? Our Reorganite friends say not, that these things\r\n_were not_ revealed. But they were revealed to Joseph Smith _and he\r\nrevealed them to others_; not the unfaithful who would receive only\r\nthe \"lesser portion of the word\" and were therefore denied the greater\r\nthings, but he taught them to the Apostles and others. Now, the Lord\r\ndid not say that Joseph Smith could not receive the fulnesss of the\r\nPriesthood _out side of the Temple_, neither that he should not confer\r\nthe same Priesthood upon others, to the contrary the Lord said He\r\nwould reveal these things to Joseph Smith, but it was _His people, His\r\nChurch_ that could not receive them outside of the Temple of the Lord!\r\nand unto them He was going to reveal them _in_ the Temple, but unto\r\nJoseph Smith He would show _all things_ pertaining to His house, and\r\n_the Priesthood thereof_.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary here to quote the evidence proving that Joseph Smith\r\nreceived _all things_ pertaining to the Priesthood of the Lord's house\r\nand conferred them on the heads of the Apostles, for that is given\r\nin another place, and has often been recorded. It is, therefore,\r\nsufficient to say that shortly before his death he conferred upon the\r\nheads of the Apostles all the _keys and Priesthood_ the Lord had given\r\nhim, and this was done by command of the Lord. We will merely refer to\r\nthe testimony of Orson Hyde which with other testimonies is given in\r\nthis book. Said Brother Hyde:\r\n\r\n    \"Before I went east on the 4th of April last, we were in council\r\n    with Brother Joseph almost every day for weeks, said Brother Joseph\r\n    in one of those councils, 'There is something going to happen; I\r\n    don't know what it is, but the Lord bids me to hasten and give you\r\n    your endowment before the Temple is finished.' He conducted us\r\n    through every ordinance of the Holy Priesthood, and when he had\r\n    gone through with all the ordinances, he rejoiced very much, and\r\n    said, 'Now, if they kill me, you have got all the keys, and all\r\n    the ordinances, and you can confer them upon others, and the hosts\r\n    of Satan will not be able to tear down the kingdom, as fast as you\r\n    will be able to build it up.'\" (Times and Seasons, 5:651).\r\n\r\n\"Have any such revelations been received? they cry. Name them. Where\r\nare they and what are they?\" Yes, these revelations have been received.\r\nThey were revealed to Joseph Smith[4] and from him to the Apostles,\r\nand by the Apostles they have been given to the faithful Saints in the\r\nTemples of the Lord; both at Nauvoo and here in Utah. \"_Name them?_\"\r\nNo, I shall not name them nor tell what they are. Why? because if the\r\nLord kept some things hid from the world since before the foundation of\r\nthe world, pertaining to the dispensation of the fulnesss of times, and\r\nhas revealed them now unto _His Church_, I have no authority to reveal\r\nthem to the world. Moreover, I am--like every other member of the\r\nChurch--\"laid under a strict command, not to impart only according to\r\nthe portion of His word, which He doth grant unto the children of men.\"\r\nShould I reveal these things, because of the hardness of your hearts\r\nyou would not receive them, therefore, you shall receive but the lesser\r\nportion of the word, to your condemnation. If you will not hear Moses\r\nand the Prophets, neither will you though one arose from the dead.\r\n\r\n\r\nREVELATION.\r\n\r\nAnother charge is that the Presidents of the Church have not\r\nreceived the revelations of the Lord which have been given to the\r\n\"Reorganization\" through their president. The charge is false. The\r\nPresidents of the Church from the Prophet Joseph until now have\r\nreceived revelations from the Lord for the guidance of His people.\r\nWhile all these revelations have not been placed in the Doctrine and\r\nCovenants, they are none the less true. Not all the revelations given\r\nto Joseph the Seer were placed in the Doctrine and Covenants in his\r\nday, we have added many of his revelations to that volume since his\r\ndeath; and there are others that have not been placed in it. Some of\r\nthem were for the Church and _not for the world_, and, therefore, are\r\ngiven only to the Saints. But many revelations have been given to\r\nthe Church since the death of Joseph Smith, some of these have been\r\npublished, some have not. It has been my privilege to read and handle\r\na number of them that are still in the manuscript and have not as yet\r\nbeen given to the world for a wise purpose in the Lord. But they are on\r\nfile and will be preserved.\r\n\r\nA short time ago a number of Elders visited Lamoni and held meetings\r\nthere. The following issue of the Saints' Herald contained an\r\neditorial, not very dignified, ridiculing them. It was written by the\r\nassociate editor. In part he said:\r\n\r\n    \"It may be urged that these are young and inexperienced men. But\r\n    the dearth of spiritual power is not confined to these young men.\r\n    Joseph F. Smith, who is supposed to be a 'Prophet, seer, and\r\n    revelator,' when before the Senate Committee was asked by Senator\r\n    Dubois, 'Have you received any individual revelations yourself,\r\n    since you became president of the Church under your own definition,\r\n    even, of a revelation?'\r\n\r\n    \"To this he replied, 'I cannot say that I have.'\r\n\r\n    \"A moment later he added, 'Well, I can say this: That if I live as\r\n    I should in the line of my duties, I am susceptible, I think, of\r\n    the impressions of the Spirit of the Lord upon my mind at any time,\r\n    _just as any good Methodist or any other church member might be_.'\r\n\r\n    \"This seems to be in line with the experiences of his predecessors,\r\n    Snow, Woodruff, Taylor, and Young, who also posed as 'revelators,'\r\n    for during a period of over sixty years they have received nothing\r\n    professing to be a revelation, that was thought worthy of a place\r\n    in the Book of Doctrine and Covenants.\" (Elbert A. Smith, _Saints'\r\n    Herald_, 56:681).\r\n\r\nThis slurring presumption counts for naught, for the editor of the\r\n_Herald_ knows nothing pertaining to the revelations we have received,\r\nor what we think of them. Nor is he fair to President Joseph F. Smith\r\nin this quotation from the record of the investigation, for it does not\r\nconvey the belief or knowledge, or the true expression of President\r\nSmith, and was purposely misapplied, which a careful reading of his\r\ntestimony will show.\r\n\r\nTo presume to speak in the name of the Lord is a serious matter, and\r\nwoe be to the man who speaks in the name of the Lord when he has not\r\nbeen commanded. It is far better never to receive a revelation than\r\nto follow after those who receive \"revelations\" that the Lord has not\r\ngiven. The \"revelations\" given by the Reorganite president to the\r\n\"Reorganized\" Church, need only to be read to convince one of their\r\nspurious character. They are weak, puerile, and it takes a very little\r\nof the spirit of discernment to know what source they are of. However,\r\nif they are acceptable to the \"Reorganization,\" that is their business.\r\nWe are satisfied.\r\n\r\nBut the people who lack in discernment may be deceived through the\r\npretenses of men and accept for facts and revelations that which the\r\nLord has not commanded. If there are any who are honestly deceived\r\npertaining to the revelations of this man who presumes to be the\r\n\"President of the High Priesthood\" and \"the mouthpiece of God,\" we will\r\nrespectfully call their attention to one or two items in his pretended\r\nrevelations.\r\n\r\nThis is from section 116, \"revelation\" given May 4, 1865:\r\n\r\n    \"Be not hasty in ordaining men of the negro race to offices in my\r\n    church, for verily I say unto you, All are not acceptable unto me\r\n    as servants, nevertheless I will that all may be saved, but every\r\n    man in his own order, and there are some who are chosen instruments\r\n    to be ministers to their own race. Be ye content, I the Lord have\r\n    spoken it.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prophet Joseph Smith taught the Saints that the negroes could not\r\nhold the Priesthood, for the Lord had cursed them as pertaining to the\r\nPriesthood. This is supported by the revelation in the Book of Abraham,\r\nwhich was translated by the Prophet. It reads:\r\n\r\n    \"Now the first government of Egypt was established by Pharaoh, the\r\n    eldest son of Egyptus, the daughter of Ham, and it was after the\r\n    manner of government of Ham, which was patriarchal.\r\n\r\n    \"Pharaoh, being a righteous man, established his kingdom and judged\r\n    his people wisely and justly all his days, seeking earnestly\r\n    to imitate that order established by the fathers in the first\r\n    generations, in the days of the first patriarchal reign, even the\r\n    reign of Adam, and also of Noah, his father, who blessed him with\r\n    the blessings of the earth, and with the blessings of wisdom, but\r\n    _cursed him as pertaining to the Priesthood_. Now, Pharaoh being of\r\n    the lineage by which _he could not have the right of Priesthood_,\r\n    notwithstanding the Pharaohs would fain claim it from Noah, through\r\n    Ham, therefore my father was led away by their idolatry.\" (Book of\r\n    Abraham 1:25-27).\r\n\r\nThe Lord did not tell Abraham that the children of Ham were cursed as\r\npertaining to the Priesthood, and then command Joseph Smith of the\r\n\"Reorganization\" to be slow in ordaining them. In the \"Reorganized\"\r\nChurch they have a few, at least, of the negro race, that they have\r\n\"ordained to the priesthood\" but it is contrary to the word of God.\r\nThis Reorganite revelation is spurious.\r\n\r\nHere is an extract from another:\r\n\r\n    \"The quorum of twelve, my servants, may choose and appoint one of\r\n    their number to take the place of my servant Alexander H. Smith,\r\n    and _if they shall choose William H. Kelley_, from among them\r\n    for this place, _it will be pleasing unto me_; NEVERTHELESS, IF\r\n    _directed by the spirit of revelation_ and _wisdom_ they _may\r\n    choose another_.\" (Sec. 124:3).\r\n\r\nCan any sane man believe that the Lord gave this \"revelation?\" Did He\r\nnot know His mind and will, was not _His_ the \"spirit of revelation and\r\nwisdom?\" or was there a disagreement on the point between the Lord and\r\nthe Holy Spirit?\r\n\r\nOther extracts might be given from these alleged \"revelations\" showing\r\ntheir inconsistency, but this will suffice. I have not given these in\r\nthe spirit of ridicule, but for the purpose of opening the eyes of\r\nthe blind that they might see, and seeing understand. Let our friends\r\nstraighten out a few things of this kind among themselves, then they\r\ncan the better attack us on the point of revelation.\r\n\r\nAt this point I desire to consider another matter. At the Salt Lake\r\nConference, held March 19, 1905, not long after the return of President\r\nJoseph F. Smith from the investigation in Washington, he addressed the\r\nSaints on the subject of revelation. In the course of his remarks, he\r\nreferred to his testimony and said:\r\n\r\n    \"Now, with reference to the principle and doctrine of revelation,\r\n    it may be proper for me to say a few words on this subject while\r\n    I am on my feet. For me to say, which was the very end that my\r\n    critics and inquisitors were endeavoring to get me to say, in order\r\n    that I might be led into that trap which they had made for me, to\r\n    say that God had given to me a revelation upon some new doctrine,\r\n    or theory, or principle, or precept, or anything to be written,\r\n    to be observed, or handed down as a guide to the Church, would\r\n    have been untrue. I could not have said that, for He has not done\r\n    this. But has God revealed to me His mind and His will? Has He made\r\n    manifest to me a knowledge of His truth by and through the Spirit\r\n    of revelation? Did you ever hear of my denying that? No; no man has\r\n    ever heard me deny that.\r\n\r\n    \"When I was baptized as a little child, right up here at the\r\n    junction of East Temple and North Temple streets, where City Creek\r\n    then ran, but where it is now covered and obliterated--when I was\r\n    baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-days Saints, God\r\n    Almighty revealed to me that I had done an act which He approved;\r\n    I received then and there a revelation from Almighty God, that\r\n    has been with me like a well of living water, springing up into\r\n    everlasting life in me, which has been a stay and a staff to me in\r\n    all my daily walks, at home and abroad. God revealed to me that\r\n    Joseph Smith was a Prophet of God, that his message was divine,\r\n    that he was raised up by the power of the Almighty to lay the\r\n    foundation of this great latter-day work. The Lord has revealed to\r\n    me the truth that he sealed his testimony with his blood, that he\r\n    was true to the end, as was the Son of God, true until he cried,\r\n    'It is enough!' upon the cross. The Lord has revealed to me in\r\n    terms that are unmistakable and that are undeniable, that Brigham\r\n    Young succeeded lawfully and divinely to the Presidency of the\r\n    Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints by the will of the\r\n    Almighty. I would not be without that revelation for all the gold\r\n    and wealth of the world. The Lord revealed to me in terms that\r\n    cannot be mistaken, by me at least, that John Taylor was inspired\r\n    of the Lord and was a Prophet of God, and was the lawful and divine\r\n    successor in the Priesthood and Presidency of the Church of Jesus\r\n    Christ of Latter-day Saints, to Brigham Young. The Lord revealed\r\n    to me that Wilford Woodruff lawfully and divinely succeeded John\r\n    Taylor, that Lorenzo Snow lawfully and divinely followed Wilford\r\n    Woodruff. I leave to you to say whether the Lord willed, and\r\n    whether it is lawful and right, that I should be in the position in\r\n    which God has suffered me to be placed. * *\r\n\r\n    \"The Lord Almighty has revealed to me many things for my own\r\n    guidance, to assist me in the discharge of my duty, as an elder in\r\n    the Church, as a high priest in the Church, as an apostle, one of\r\n    the twelve apostles in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\r\n    Saints. And I fervently believe that God has manifested to me in\r\n    my present capacity, many glorious things, many principles and\r\n    oftentimes much more wisdom than is inherent in myself; and I\r\n    believe He will continue to do so as long as I am receptive, as\r\n    long as I am in a position to hear when He speaks, to listen when\r\n    He calls, and to receive when He gives to me that which He desires.\"\r\n\r\nThese remarks were taken up, twisted, and falsified by a Salt Lake\r\nnewspaper, which is so characterless and vile that it is without an\r\nequal, and sent out into the world as a press dispatch, declaring\r\nthat President Joseph F. Smith had in the Tabernacle confessed that\r\nhe had lied before the Senate Committee on Privileges and Elections,\r\nin relation to the subject of revelation when he was a witness before\r\nsaid committee. They made it appear in their dispatch that he had\r\nstated in Washington that he had not received any revelation, and in\r\nthe Tabernacle he declared that that was false for he had received many\r\nof them. He testified in Washington as he testified in the Tabernacle,\r\nthat he had received revelation, as this will show:\r\n\r\n    Mr. Tayler: Did Joseph Smith contend that always there was a\r\n    visible appearance of the Almighty or of an angel?\r\n\r\n    Mr. Smith. No, sir: he did not.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Tayler. How otherwise did he claim to receive revelations?\r\n\r\n    Mr. Smith. By the Spirit of the Lord.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Tayler. And in that way, such revelations _as you have\r\n    received_, you have had them?\r\n\r\n    Mr. Smith. Yes, sir. (Investigation, Vol. 1: 100).\r\n\r\nWithout waiting to verify this falsehood circulated from an unspeakable\r\nsource in Salt Lake City, the President of the \"Reorganization,\" as\r\neditor of the _Saints' Herald_ took up the hue and cry with evident\r\ngreat pleasure and wrote an editorial consigning President Joseph F.\r\nSmith to perdition as a perjurer in the following words:\r\n\r\n                      \"_Who Make and Love a Lie_.\"\r\n\r\n    \"If President Joseph F. Smith has stated in public what it is\r\n    currently reported he has, that in the statements made by him\r\n    when a witness before the Senatorial Committee, whose sittings\r\n    for inquiry have lately been finished, the report of which in\r\n    regard to the unseating of Senator Smoot is awaited, he testified\r\n    to that which was not true, he has done an unfortunate and unwise\r\n    thing. There may have been some moral bravery in doing as he did\r\n    in stating that he was breaking the law of the State, the law of\r\n    the United States, and the law of God by continuing to live with\r\n    his five wives; and such boldness may have made some admirers of\r\n    the President of the Utah Church; but, when that president publicly\r\n    states that he lied when he gave his evidence before the Senatorial\r\n    Committee, those who may have admired him for his avowal of his\r\n    guilt will not, cannot admire him as a confessed perjurer. It may\r\n    be said that President Joseph F. Smith did not make oath to what\r\n    was false, as he was not sworn, that is, no judicial oath was\r\n    administered to him, but, when a witness chooses to affirm that\r\n    privilege is granted by the courts; the form of the affirmation is\r\n    much like this: 'I do solemnly affirm, subject to the pains and\r\n    penalties of perjury, that the testimony I shall give in the case\r\n    now pending * * * shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing\r\n    but the truth.' If President Joseph F. Smith faced the committee\r\n    on such an affirmation, and gave false testimony, can it be called\r\n    anything but perjury? We think not.\r\n\r\n    \"We were surprised when he testified as he did; we now are more\r\n    surprised to learn that he has said that he affirmed what was not\r\n    true. What can honorable men in or out of the Church think of such\r\n    a man? What reliance can be placed on what such a man declares?\r\n    If he sought by falsehood to avoid falling into a \"trap\" set for\r\n    him before the committee, by confessing that he did so falsify, he\r\n    has assuredly fallen into a more open and dangerous one.\" (Saints'\r\n    Herald, Vol. 52:314-315).\r\n\r\nImmediately after this editorial appeared in the _Saints' Herald_ the\r\nattention of the editor, Joseph Smith, was called to the fact that it\r\nwas based on a falsehood. Among others who requested him to correct\r\nthe wrong and injustice he had inflicted on his people as well as on\r\nPresident Smith, was the writer, who immediately forwarded a protest\r\nwith a clipping from a non-\"Mormon\" Utah paper correcting the false\r\nreport. Others wrote to him on the same subject, but no satisfactory\r\ncorrection was ever made. This was very unchristianlike conduct; surely\r\nnot the part of a prophet of the Lord! It is true, that in a later\r\neditorial he quoted a portion of the remarks of President Joseph F.\r\nSmith delivered at that conference, but without apology or correction\r\nfor bearing false witness. This is the comment following the brief\r\nextract he saw fit to give:\r\n\r\n    \"We give these extracts from President Joseph F. Smith's talk on\r\n    the afternoon of March 19, 1905, on the subject of revelation, as\r\n    they contain the statements on which the charge is based that he\r\n    contradicted and denied what he testified to before the Territorial\r\n    (Investigation) Committee, offering no comment upon them, leaving\r\n    those who read them to judge of them without the bias of an\r\n    expression from us.\"\r\n\r\nSurely his sense of fairness after making such an accusation, should\r\nhave demanded of him more than this.\r\n\r\nThe following letter, which, under the circumstances, is worthy of\r\nproducing, was forwarded to him also requesting that justice be done,\r\nbut it was ignored absolutely:\r\n\r\n                                      \"Salt Lake City, April 5, 1905.\r\n\r\n    \"_Joseph Smith, Esq_.,\r\n        \"_Editor, 'The Saints' Herald,'_\r\n            \"_Lamoni, Iowa_.\r\n\r\n    \"My Dear Sir:\r\n\r\n    \"I was very greatly surprised to notice in the issue of the\r\n    'Herald' of March 29, 1905, your editorial entitled, 'Who Make\r\n    and Love a Lie.' I am surprised because of the plainly implied\r\n    accusation that President Joseph F. Smith is a maker and lover\r\n    of lies. I am surprised because of the unfairness of the article\r\n    referred to which will take for granted the statement of a\r\n    man's bitterest foe and place that statement before his people,\r\n    commenting upon it as if it were an admitted fact, without one\r\n    word of explanation from the person so wickedly accused, or a\r\n    single effort to present both sides. I am surprised because such an\r\n    article appears in a periodical which is the organ of a religious\r\n    organization claiming to have sprung out of the work founded by the\r\n    great prophet who, 'came up through much tribulation,' and who was\r\n    misrepresented through all his days upon the earth.\r\n\r\n    \"I am surprised that a man whose early years were spent in the\r\n    sorrows and privations incident to the persecutions suffered by\r\n    a father whose whole life was spent in sorrow and affliction,\r\n    in consequence of the false testimony borne against him and the\r\n    constant misrepresentation of his mission, should allow himself to\r\n    pass judgment upon another before hearing his defense, and finding\r\n    him guilty of 'an unfortunate and unwise thing,' forgetting the\r\n    wise proverb, 'He who judgeth a matter before he heareth it, is not\r\n    wise.'\r\n\r\n    \"It is true, the article begins with the expression--'_If_President\r\n    Joseph F.

They know him to be\r\n    an upright, true, pure, honorable man, whose simple life has been\r\n    before his people all his days, whose heart is true, whose tongue\r\n    is true, whose courage is undaunted, whose faith is unshaken, and\r\n    who is, in all respects, worthy of the love, confidence and support\r\n    of the people of the living God.\r\n\r\n    \"In order that you may not fall under the dreadful charge of\r\n    'Loving and Making a Lie,' will you publish, for the information of\r\n    the readers of the 'Herald,' the other side of this matter if it is\r\n    furnished you?\r\n\r\n    \"It is not my habit to take up matters of this kind, and if these\r\n    accusations had been made against myself, I should never have\r\n    noticed them, but knowing what a great injustice your article\r\n    does to a good and noble man--my true friend and brother--I felt\r\n    impelled to call your attention to it, in the hope that your sense\r\n    of fairness would cause you to do simple justice, and not join in\r\n    the hue and cry of those who 'Make and Love a Lie.'\"\r\n\r\n                                                    \"Yours truly,\r\n                                                        \"THOMAS HULL.\"\r\n\r\nHe failed absolutely, when the evidence was furnished him, to justly,\r\nhonorably, make the matter right. There is some degree of commendation\r\ndue the man who maligns another if he is willing to make amends, and\r\nwe can honor a man who will correct an error when he discovers that\r\nfact and is willing to make full satisfaction; but little respect can\r\nbe had for one who, after wronging another, will not attempt to right\r\nit when he learns he is wrong. Abraham Lincoln said in his debate with\r\nDouglas, that there was a _moral rule_, \"That persons who tell what\r\nthey do not know to be true, falsify as much as those who knowingly\r\ntell falsehoods.\" We leave the matter in the hand of a Just Judge, who\r\nwill judge all men according to their works.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHO ORDAINED BRIGHAM YOUNG.\r\n\r\n_The following is from the Deseret News, May 11, 1907_.\r\n\r\nA correspondent writing from Parker, Idaho, requests a reply, through\r\nthe columns of the \"News\" to the question, \"By whom was President\r\nYoung ordained to the Presidency of the Church?\" It appears that the\r\nemissaries of the Reorganite Church have discovered in that question\r\na fruitful source of sophistical controversy, and that they are\r\ntriumphantly asking it wherever they go.\r\n\r\nThe proper reply is, he was ordained by the Prophet Joseph to that\r\ncalling, when the Prophet, prompted by the Holy Spirit, conferred upon\r\nthe Twelve Apostles the power and authority, he himself had received.\r\nThe following statement of facts by Elder Joseph F. Smith, Jr., can be\r\nverified by the authentic records of the Church:\r\n\r\n\"The Prophet Joseph earnestly desired that his brother Hyrum should\r\nlive to succeed him in the Presidency of the Church. In the year 1841,\r\nby command of the Lord, he ordained him to this exalted position, as\r\nis quite evident from the following, Section 124, verses 94-5, of the\r\nDoctrine and Covenants:\r\n\r\n    \"And from this time forth I appoint unto him (Hyrum Smith) that he\r\n    may be a prophet, and a seer, and a revelator unto my Church as\r\n    well as my servant Joseph.\r\n\r\n    \"That he may act in concert also with my servant Joseph, and that\r\n    he shall receive counsel from my servant Joseph, who shall show\r\n    unto him the keys whereby he may ask and receive, and be crowned\r\n    with the same blessing and glory, and honor, and Priesthood, and\r\n    gifts of the Priesthood, that once were put upon him that was my\r\n    servant Oliver Cowdery.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this revelation we learn that the Lord appointed Hyrum Smith both\r\nas Patriarch and to act in concert with his brother Joseph in the\r\nPresidency of the Church. In accordance with this revelation, Hyrum was\r\nso ordained January 24, 1841. This was not in the sense of a counselor\r\nto Joseph, for at this very appointment Hyrum was removed as counselor\r\nto the President and William Law was ordained in his stead.\r\n\r\nJoseph and Hyrum continued to so act from this time forth until their\r\nmartyrdom, June 27, 1844. Shortly before the martyrdom the Prophet\r\ntried with all his power to persuade Hyrum not to accompany him to\r\nCarthage, knowing full well the fate that awaited them there. Had\r\nHyrum stayed behind, and thereby remained in mortality, he would, by\r\nvirtue of his position and ordination received in 1841, have become\r\nthe president of the Church. His brother intended that this should be\r\n(Times and Seasons, 5:683), but through his faithfulness to, and love\r\nfor, his brother, Hyrum fell a martyr before the Prophet Joseph did.\r\n\r\nNow mark! The Lord, who knew that Hyrum should receive a martyr's crown\r\nat Carthage, in the winter of 1843-4, commanded the Prophet to confer\r\nupon the heads of the Twelve Apostles, every key, power, and principle,\r\nthat the Lord had sealed upon his head. The Prophet declared that he\r\nknew not why, but the Lord commanded him to endow the Twelve with these\r\nkeys and Priesthood, and after it was done, he rejoiced very much,\r\nsaying in substance, \"Now, if they kill me, you have all the keys and\r\nall the ordinances and you can confer them upon others, and the powers\r\nof Satan will not be able to tear down the kingdom as fast as you will\r\nbe able to build it up, and upon your shoulders will the responsibility\r\nof leading this people rest.\" (Times and Seasons, 5:651).\r\n\r\nIn this manner the Prophet ordained the Twelve Apostles, which body\r\nconstitutes the second quorum of the Church, equal in authority with\r\nthe First Presidency. (Doc. & Cov. 107:23-24) with the keys of the\r\nkingdom, Brigham Young was president of the Twelve, and upon him\r\ndevolved the duty of presiding.\r\n\r\nTherefore, after the death of Joseph and Hyrum Smith, the Twelve\r\nassumed by authority of their office, the duty to preside over the\r\nChurch. Later, when through revelation the quorum of the First\r\nPresidency was reorganized with three presidents--Brigham Young and\r\nCounselors Heber C. Kimball and Willard Richards, they claimed, and\r\nrightfully, that since they were ordained under the hands of Joseph\r\nSmith and from him had received all the keys and powers of the\r\nPriesthood which the Prophet held, it would have been superfluous to\r\nhave been ordained again. They were in this capacity, however, set\r\napart and sustained by the unanimous vote of the Saints, which was\r\nessential to make such ordination of force in the Church.\r\n\r\nThere is an abundance of testimony to prove that the Prophet did so\r\nordain the Twelve, some of which can be found in the Times and Seasons,\r\nvolume 5, pages 651, 664, and 698; also in the Millennial Star, volume\r\n10, page 115.\r\n\r\nWe repeat that Brigham Young received all the keys, powers, authority\r\nand Priesthood, that were held by Joseph Smith, that enabled him to\r\npreside over the High Priesthood, from the Prophet Joseph Smith in\r\nNauvoo in the winter of 1843-4.\"\r\n\r\nThis important question was settled long ago by the entire body of the\r\nSaints who accepted the leadership of the Twelve, after the departure\r\nof the Prophet and Patriarch, and sustained President Young in his\r\noffice. It was settled by the approval of the Almighty of the marvelous\r\nwork He accomplished, and which could not have been done without\r\ndivine aid and guidance. To ascribe the mighty deeds Brigham Young\r\nperformed through the power of the divine Spirit which rested upon\r\nhim, to the spirit that is the originator of succession, rebellion,\r\napostasy, and falsehood, is to come dangerously near blasphemy. What\r\nis it but a repetition of the sin of the adversaries of our Lord who,\r\nalthough they knew that \"no man can do the miracles that thou doest,\r\nexcept God be with him\" (John 3:2): yet proclaimed to the people: \"He\r\nhath an unclean spirit,\" (Mark 3:30). What is it but to assail the\r\ndisciple with a weapon that was in vain directed against the Master?\r\nThere was some excuse for difference of opinion on the subject of\r\nsuccession, immediately after the martyrdom, because the people were\r\nnot in possession of full information, but there is no excuse now. To\r\nuse a familiar illustration: At the time of an election citizens are\r\nexpected to have different opinions as to candidates for office; they\r\nare expected to work for those whose views and principles they support.\r\nBut when the question is settled at the polls, loyalty demands that all\r\naccept the verdict and work together for the common interests of the\r\ncommunity. The body of the Latter-day Saints having accepted, as guided\r\nby the Holy Spirit, the leadership of the Twelve, there was no longer\r\nany valid reason for seeking the leadership of other shepherds.\r\n\r\nThe trouble with some of our \"Reorganized\" brethren is that they\r\nlook upon the members of the Church as a flock of sheep, that, like\r\nother property, can be inherited. This is entirely contrary to the\r\nfundamental principles of the Gospel. The Church belongs to Christ. The\r\nleaders and officers are the servants of the Lord and the people of the\r\nLord. It follows that the Lord raises up whoever He pleases, to perform\r\nthe services necessary from time to time. Brigham Young was every way\r\nequipped for the peculiar work needed during his time. Who could have\r\ndone what he did? Sidney Rigdon? Lyman Wight? James J. Strang? Or the\r\nfounders of the so-called \"Reorganized\" Church? Let the reader reflect\r\non the facts history records, and then decide for himself, remembering\r\nthat every tree is known by its fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes\r\n\r\n1.

As an additional evidence that these things were revealed to the\r\nProphet, attention is called to the patriarchal blessing given by his\r\nfather and found on page 71:\r\n\r\n\"You shall even live to finish your work. At this Joseph cried out,\r\nweeping, 'Oh, my father, shall I?' 'Yes,' said his father, 'you shall\r\nlive to lay out the plan of all the work which God has given you to do.\"\r\n\r\nThis proves, then, that the Lord revealed to him all these things\r\npromised in the revelations that had been kept hid. And he revealed\r\nthem unto the Apostles.",
