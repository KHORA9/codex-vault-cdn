It is with deep concern I am now to inform you that the\r\nfavorable prospect has been over-clouded by a refusal of the British\r\nGovernment to abide by the act of its minister plenipotentiary, and by its\r\nensuing policy toward the United States as seen through the communications\r\nof the minister sent to replace him.\r\n\r\nWhatever pleas may be urged for a disavowal of engagements formed by\r\ndiplomatic functionaries in cases where by the terms of the engagements a\r\nmutual ratification is reserved, or where notice at the time may have been\r\ngiven of a departure from instructions, or in extraordinary cases\r\nessentially violating the principles of equity, a disavowal could not have\r\nbeen apprehended in a case where no such notice or violation existed, where\r\nno such ratification was reserved, and more especially where, as is now in\r\nproof, an engagement to be executed without any such ratification was\r\ncontemplated by the instructions given, and where it had with good faith\r\nbeen carried into immediate execution on the part of the United States.\r\n\r\nThese considerations not having restrained the British Government from\r\ndisavowing the arrangement by virtue of which its orders in council were to\r\nbe revoked, and the event authorizing the renewal of commercial intercourse\r\nhaving thus not taken place, it necessarily became a question of equal\r\nurgency and importance whether the act prohibiting that intercourse was not\r\nto be considered as remaining in legal force. This question being, after\r\ndue deliberation, determined in the affirmative, a proclamation to that\r\neffect was issued. It could not but happen, however, that a return to this\r\nstate of things from that which had followed an execution of the\r\narrangement by the United States would involve difficulties. With a view to\r\ndiminish these as much as possible, the instructions from the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury now laid before you were transmitted to the collectors of the\r\nseveral ports. If in permitting British vessels to depart without giving\r\nbonds not to proceed to their own ports it should appear that the tenor of\r\nlegal authority has not been strictly pursued, it is to be ascribed to the\r\nanxious desire which was felt that no individuals should be injured by so\r\nunforeseen an occurrence; and I rely on the regard of Congress for the\r\nequitable interests of our own citizens to adopt whatever further\r\nprovisions may be found requisite for a general remission of penalties\r\ninvoluntarily incurred.\r\n\r\nThe recall of the disavowed minister having been followed by the\r\nappointment of a successor, hopes were indulged that the new mission would\r\ncontribute to alleviate the disappointment which had been produced, and to\r\nremove the causes which had so long embarrassed the good understanding of\r\nthe two nations. It could not be doubted that it would at least be charged\r\nwith conciliatory explanations of the step which had been taken and with\r\nproposals to be substituted for the rejected arrangement.\r\n\r\nReasonable and universal as this expectation was, it also has not been\r\nfulfilled. From the first official disclosures of the new minister it was\r\nfound that he had received no authority to enter into explanations relative\r\nto either branch of the arrangement disavowed nor any authority to\r\nsubstitute proposals as to that branch which concerned the British orders\r\nin council, and, finally, that his proposals with regard to the other\r\nbranch, the attack on the frigate Chesapeake, were founded on a\r\npresumption repeatedly declared to be inadmissible by the United States,\r\nthat the first step toward adjustment was due from them, the proposals\r\nat the same time omitting even a reference to the officer answerable for\r\nthe murderous aggression, and asserting a claim not less contrary to the\r\nBritish laws and British practice than to the principles and obligations\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence between the Department of State and this minister will\r\nshow how unessentially the features presented in its commencement have been\r\nvaried in its progress. It will show also that, forgetting the respect due\r\nto all governments, he did not refrain from imputations on this, which\r\nrequired that no further communications should be received from him. The\r\nnecessity of this step will be made known to His Britannic Majesty through\r\nthe minister plenipotentiary of the United States in London; and it would\r\nindicate a want of the confidence due to a Government which so well\r\nunderstands and exacts what becomes foreign ministers near it not to infer\r\nthat the misconduct of its own representative will be viewed in the same\r\nlight in which it has been regarded here. The British Government will learn\r\nat the same time that a ready attention will be given to communications\r\nthrough any channel which may be substituted. It will be happy if the\r\nchange in this respect should be accompanied by a favorable revision of the\r\nunfriendly policy which has been so long pursued toward the United States.\r\n\r\nWith France, the other belligerent, whose trespasses on our commercial\r\nrights have long been the subject of our just remonstrances, the posture of\r\nour relations does not correspond with the measures taken on the part of\r\nthe United States to effect a favorable change. The result of the several\r\ncommunications made to her Government, in pursuance of the authorities\r\nvested by Congress in the Executive, is contained in the correspondence of\r\nour minister at Paris now laid before you.\r\n\r\nBy some of the other belligerents, although professing just and amicable\r\ndispositions, injuries materially affecting our commerce have not been duly\r\ncontrolled or repressed. In these cases the interpositions deemed proper on\r\nour part have not been omitted. But it well deserves the consideration of\r\nthe Legislature how far both the safety and the honor of the American flag\r\nmay be consulted, by adequate provisions against that collusive\r\nprostitution of it by individuals unworthy of the American name which has\r\nso much flavored the real or pretended suspicions under which the honest\r\ncommerce of their fellow citizens has suffered.\r\n\r\nIn relation to the powers on the coast of Barbary, nothing has occurred\r\nwhich is not of a nature rather to inspire confidence than distrust as to\r\nthe continuance of the existing amity. With our Indian neighbors, the just\r\nand benevolent system continued toward them has also preserved peace, and\r\nis more and more advancing habits favorable to their civilization and\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nFrom a statement which will be made by the Secretary of War it will be seen\r\nthat the fortifications on our maritime frontier are in many of the ports\r\ncompleted, affording the defense which was contemplated, and that a further\r\ntime will be required to render complete the works in the harbor of New\r\nYork and in some other places. By the enlargement of the works and the\r\nemployment of a greater number of hands at the public armories the supply\r\nof small arms of an improving quality appears to be annually increasing at\r\na rate that, with those made on private contract, may be expected to go far\r\ntoward providing for the public exigency.\r\n\r\nThe act of Congress providing for the equipment of our vessels of war\r\nhaving been fully carried into execution, I refer to the statement of the\r\nSecretary of the Navy for the information which may be proper on that\r\nsubject. To that statement is added a view of the transfers of\r\nappropriations authorized by the act of the session preceding the last and\r\nof the grounds on which the transfers were made.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the course of your deliberations on the subject of our\r\nmilitary establishments, I should fail in my duty in not recommending to\r\nyour serious attention the importance of giving to our militia, the great\r\nbulwark of our security and resource of our power, an organization best\r\nadapted to eventual situations for which the United States ought to be\r\nprepared.\r\n\r\nThe sums which had been previously accumulated in the Treasury, together\r\nwith the receipts during the year ending on the 30th of September last (and\r\namounting to more than $9 millions), have enabled us to fulfill all our\r\nengagements and to defray the current expenses of Government without\r\nrecurring to any loan. But the insecurity of our commerce and the\r\nconsequent diminution of the public revenue will probably produce a\r\ndeficiency in the receipts of the ensuing year, for which and for other\r\ndetails I refer to the statements which will be transmitted from the\r\nTreasury.\r\n\r\nIn the state which has been presented of our affairs with the great parties\r\nto a disastrous and protracted war, carried on in a mode equally injurious\r\nand unjust to the United States as a neutral nation, the wisdom of the\r\nNational Legislature will be again summoned to the important decision on\r\nthe alternatives before them. That these will be met in a spirit worthy the\r\ncouncils of a nation conscious both of its rectitude and of its rights, and\r\ncareful as well of its honor as of its peace, I have an entire confidence;\r\nand that the result will be stamped by a unanimity becoming the occasion,\r\nand be supported by every portion of our citizens with a patriotism\r\nenlightened and invigorated by experience, ought as little to be doubted.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the wrongs and vexations experienced from external causes\r\nthere is much room for congratulation on the prosperity and happiness\r\nflowing from our situation at home. The blessing of health has never been\r\nmore universal. The fruits of the seasons, though in particular articles\r\nand districts short of their usual redundancy, are more than sufficient for\r\nour wants and our comforts. The face of our country ever presents evidence\r\nof laudable enterprise, of extensive capital, and of durable improvement.\r\nIn a cultivation of the materials and the extension of useful manufactures,\r\nmore especially in the general application to household fabrics, we behold\r\na rapid diminution of our dependence on foreign supplies. Nor is it\r\nunworthy of reflection that this revolution in our pursuits and habits is\r\nin no slight degree a consequence of those impolitic and arbitrary edicts\r\nby which the contending nations, in endeavoring each of them to obstruct\r\nour trade with the other, have so far abridged our means of procuring the\r\nproductions and manufactures of which our own are now taking the place.\r\n\r\nRecollecting always that for every advantage which may contribute to\r\ndistinguish our lot from that to which others are doomed by the unhappy\r\nspirit of the times we are indebted to that Divine Providence whose\r\ngoodness has been so remarkably extended to this rising nation, it becomes\r\nus to cherish a devout gratitude, and to implore from the same omnipotent\r\nsource a blessing on the consultations and measures about to be undertaken\r\nfor the welfare of our beloved country.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nJames Madison\r\nDecember 5, 1810\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nThe embarrassments which have prevailed in our foreign relations, and so\r\nmuch employed the deliberations of Congress, make it a primary duty in\r\nmeeting you to communicate whatever may have occurred in that branch of our\r\nnational affairs.\r\n\r\nThe act of the last session of Congress concerning the commercial\r\nintercourse between the United States and Great Britain and France and\r\ntheir dependencies having invited in a new form a termination of their\r\nedicts against our neutral commerce, copies of the act were immediately\r\nforwarded to our ministers at London and Paris, with a view that its object\r\nmight be within the early attention of the French and British Governments.\r\n\r\nBy the communication received through our minister at Paris it appeared\r\nthat knowledge of the act by the French Government was followed by a\r\ndeclaration that the Berlin and Milan decrees were revoked, and would cease\r\nto have effect on the first day of November ensuing. These being the only\r\nknown edicts of France within the description of the act, and the\r\nrevocation of them being such that they ceased at that date to violate our\r\nneutral commerce, the fact, as prescribed by law, was announced by a\r\nproclamation bearing date the 2nd of November.\r\n\r\nIt would have well accorded with the conciliatory views indicated by this\r\nproceeding on the part of France to have extended them to all the grounds\r\nof just complaint which now remain unadjusted with the United States. It\r\nwas particularly anticipated that, as a further evidence of just\r\ndispositions toward them, restoration would have been immediately made of\r\nthe property of our citizens under a misapplication of the principle of\r\nreprisals combined with a misconstruction of a law of the United States.\r\nThis expectation has not been fulfilled.\r\n\r\nFrom the British Government no communication on the subject of the act has\r\nbeen received. To a communication from our minister at London of a\r\nrevocation by the French Government of its Berlin and Milan decrees it was\r\nanswered that the British system would be relinquished as soon as the\r\nrepeal of the French decrees should have actually taken effect and the\r\ncommerce of neutral nations have been restored to the condition in which it\r\nstood previously to the promulgation of those decrees. This pledge,\r\nalthough it does not necessarily import, does not exclude the intention of\r\nrelinquishing, along with the others in council, the practice of those\r\nnovel blockades which have a like effect of interrupting our neutral\r\ncommerce, and this further justice to the United States is the rather to be\r\nlooked for, in as much as the blockades in question, being not more\r\ncontrary to the established law of nations than inconsistent with the rules\r\nof blockade formally recognized by Great Britain herself, could have no\r\nalleged basis other than the plea of retaliation alleged as the basis of\r\nthe orders in council.\r\n\r\nUnder the modification of the original orders of November, 1807, into the\r\norders of April, 1809, there is, indeed, scarcely a nominal distinction\r\nbetween the orders and the blockades. One of those illegitimate blockades,\r\nbearing date in May, 1806, having been expressly avowed to be still\r\nunrescinded, and to be in effect comprehended in the orders in council, was\r\ntoo distinctly brought within the purview of the act of Congress not to be\r\ncomprehended in the explanation of the requisites to a compliance with it.\r\nThe British Government was accordingly apprised by our minister near it\r\nthat such was the light in which the subject was to be regarded.\r\n\r\nOn the other important subjects depending between the United States and the\r\nGovernment no progress has been made from which an early and satisfactory\r\nresult can be relied on.\r\n\r\nIn this new posture of our relations with those powers the consideration of\r\nCongress will be properly turned to a removal of doubts which may occur in\r\nthe exposition and of difficulties in the execution of the act above\r\ncited.\r\n\r\nThe commerce of the United States with the north of Europe, heretofore much\r\nvexed by licentious cruisers, particularly under the Danish flag, has\r\nlatterly been visited with fresh and extensive depredations. The measures\r\npursued in behalf of our injured citizens not having obtained justice for\r\nthem, a further and more formal interposition with the Danish Government is\r\ncontemplated. The principles which have been maintained by that Government\r\nin relation to neutral commerce, and the friendly professions of His Danish\r\nMajesty toward the United States, are valuable pledges in favor of a\r\nsuccessful issue.\r\n\r\nAmong the events growing out of the state of the Spanish Monarchy, our\r\nattention was imperiously attracted to the change developing itself in that\r\nportion of West Florida which, though of right appertaining to the United\r\nStates, had remained in the possession of Spain awaiting the result of\r\nnegotiations for its actual delivery to them. The Spanish authority was\r\nsubverted and a situation produced exposing the country to ulterior events\r\nwhich might essentially affect the rights and welfare of the Union. In such\r\na conjuncture I did not delay the interposition required for the occupancy\r\nof the territory west of the river Perdido, to which the title of the\r\nUnited States extends, and to which the laws provided for the Territory of\r\nOrleans are applicable. With this view, the proclamation of which a copy is\r\nlaid before you was confided to the governor of that Territory to be\r\ncarried into effect. The legality and necessity of the course pursued\r\nassure me of the favorable light in which it will present itself to the\r\nLegislature, and of the promptitude with which they will supply whatever\r\nprovisions may be due to the essential rights and equitable interests of\r\nthe people thus brought into the bosom of the American family.\r\n\r\nOur amity with the powers of Barbary, with the exception of a recent\r\noccurrence at Tunis, of which an explanation is just received, appears to\r\nhave been uninterrupted and to have become more firmly established.\r\n\r\nWith the Indian tribes also the peace and friendship of the United States\r\nare found to be so eligible that the general disposition to preserve both\r\ncontinues to gain strength.\r\n\r\nI feel particular satisfaction in remarking that an interior view of our\r\ncountry presents us with grateful proofs of its substantial and increasing\r\nprosperity. To a thriving agriculture and the improvements related to it is\r\nadded a highly interesting extension of useful manufactures, the combined\r\nproduct of professional occupations and of household industry. Such indeed\r\nis the experience of economy as well as of policy in these substitutes for\r\nsupplies heretofore obtained by foreign commerce that in a national view\r\nthe change is justly regarded as of itself more than a recompense for those\r\nprivations and losses resulting from foreign injustice which furnished the\r\ngeneral impulse required for its accomplishment. How far it may be\r\nexpedient to guard the infancy of this improvement in the distribution of\r\nlabor by regulations of the commercial tariff is a subject which can not\r\nfail to suggest itself to your patriotic reflections.\r\n\r\nIt will rest with the consideration of Congress also whether a provident as\r\nwell as fair encouragement would not be given to our navigation by such\r\nregulations as would place it on a level of competition with foreign\r\nvessels, particularly in transporting the important and bulky productions\r\nof our own soil. The failure of equality and reciprocity in the existing\r\nregulations on this subject operates in our ports as a premium to foreign\r\ncompetitors, and the inconvenience must increase as these may be multiplied\r\nunder more favorable circumstances by the more than countervailing\r\nencouragements now given them by the laws of their respective countries.\r\n\r\nWhilst it is universally admitted that a well-instructed people alone can\r\nbe permanently a free people, and whilst it is evident that the means of\r\ndiffusing and improving useful knowledge form so small a proportion of the\r\nexpenditures for national purposes, I can not presume it to be unseasonable\r\nto invite your attention to the advantages of superadding to the means of\r\neducation provided by the several States a seminary of learning instituted\r\nby the National Legislature within the limits of their exclusive\r\njurisdiction, the expense of which might be defrayed or reimbursed out of\r\nthe vacant grounds which have accrued to the nation within those limits.\r\n\r\nSuch an institution, though local in its legal character, would be\r\nuniversal in its beneficial effects. By enlightening the opinions, by\r\nexpanding the patriotism, and by assimilating the principles, the\r\nsentiments, and the manners of those who might resort to this temple of\r\nscience, to be redistributed in due time through every part of the\r\ncommunity, sources of jealousy and prejudice would be diminished, the\r\nfeatures of national character would be multiplied, and greater extent\r\ngiven to social harmony. But, above all, a well-constituted seminary in\r\nthe center of the nation is recommended by the consideration that the\r\nadditional instruction emanating from it would contribute not less to\r\nstrengthen the foundations than to adorn the structure of our free and\r\nhappy system of government.\r\n\r\nAmong the commercial abuses still committed under the American flag, and\r\nleaving in force my former reference to that subject, it appears that\r\nAmerican citizens are instrumental in carrying on a traffic in enslaved\r\nAfricans, equally in violation of the laws of humanity and in defiance of\r\nthose of their own country. The same just and benevolent motives which\r\nproduced interdiction in force against this criminal conduct will doubtless\r\nbe felt by Congress in devising further means of suppressing the evil.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of uncertainties necessarily connected with the great\r\ninterests of the United States, prudence requires a continuance of our\r\ndefensive and precautionary arrangement. The Secretary of War and Secretary\r\nof the Navy will submit the statements and estimates which may aid Congress\r\nin their ensuing provisions for the land and naval forces. The statements\r\nof the latter will include a view of the transfers of appropriations in the\r\nnaval expenditures and in the grounds on which they were made.\r\n\r\nThe fortifications for the defense of our maritime frontier have been\r\nprosecuted according to the plan laid down in 1808. The works, with some\r\nexceptions, are completed and furnished with ordnance. Those for the\r\nsecurity of the city of New York, though far advanced toward completion,\r\nwill require a further time and appropriation. This is the case with a few\r\nothers, either not completed or in need of repairs.\r\n\r\nThe improvements in quality and quantity made in the manufacture of cannon\r\nand small arms, both at the public armories and private factories, warrant\r\nadditional confidence in the competency of these resources for supplying\r\nthe public exigencies.\r\n\r\nThese preparations for arming the militia having thus far provided for one\r\nof the objects contemplated by the power vested in Congress with respect\r\nto that great bulwark of the public safety, it is for their consideration\r\nwhether further provisions are not requisite for the other contemplated\r\nobjects of organization and discipline. To give to this great mass of\r\nphysical and moral force the efficiency which it merits, and is capable of\r\nreceiving, it is indispensable that they should be instructed and practiced\r\nin the rules by which they are to be governed. Toward an accomplishment of\r\nthis important work I recommend for the consideration of Congress the\r\nexpediency of instituting a system which shall in the first instance call\r\ninto the field at the public expense and for a given time certain portions\r\nof the commissioned and non-commissioned officers. The instruction and\r\ndiscipline thus acquired would gradually diffuse through the entire body of\r\nthe militia that practical knowledge and promptitude for active service\r\nwhich are the great ends to be pursued. Experience has left no doubt either\r\nof the necessity or of the efficacy of competent military skill in those\r\nportions of an army in fitting it for the final duties which it may have to\r\nperform.\r\n\r\nThe Corps of Engineers, with the Military Academy, are entitled to the\r\nearly attention of Congress. The buildings at the seat fixed by law for the\r\npresent Academy are so far in decay as not to afford the necessary\r\naccommodation. But a revision of the law is recommended, principally with a\r\nview to a more enlarged cultivation and diffusion of the advantages of such\r\ninstitutions, by providing professorships for all the necessary branches of\r\nmilitary instruction, and by the establishment of an additional academy at\r\nthe seat of Government or elsewhere. The means by which war, as well for\r\ndefense as for offense, are now carried on render these schools of the more\r\nscientific operations an indispensable part of every adequate system.\r\n\r\nEven among nations whose large standing armies and frequent wars afford\r\nevery other opportunity of instruction these establishments are found to be\r\nindispensable for the due attainment of the branches of military science\r\nwhich require a regular course of study and experiment. In a government\r\nhappily without the other opportunities seminaries where the elementary\r\nprinciples of the art of war can be taught without actual war, and without\r\nthe expense of extensive and standing armies, have the precious advantage\r\nof uniting an essential preparation against external danger with a\r\nscrupulous regard to internal safety. In no other way, probably, can a\r\nprovision of equal efficacy for the public defense be made at so little\r\nexpense or more consistently with the public liberty.\r\n\r\nThe receipts into the Treasury during the year ending on the 30th of\r\nSeptember last (and amounting to more than $8.5 millions) have exceeded\r\nthe current expenses of the Government, including the interest on the\r\npublic debt. For the purpose of reimbursing at the end of the year $3.75\r\nmillions of the principal, a loan, as authorized by law, had been\r\nnegotiated to that amount, but has since been reduced to $2.75 millions,\r\nthe reduction being permitted by the state of the Treasury, in which there\r\nwill be a balance remaining at the end of the year estimated at $2\r\nmillions. For the probable receipts of the next year and other details I\r\nrefer to statements which will be transmitted from the Treasury, and which\r\nwill enable you to judge what further provisions may be necessary for the\r\nensuing years.\r\n\r\nReserving for future occasions in the course of the session whatever other\r\ncommunications may claim your attention, I close the present by expressing\r\nmy reliance, under the blessing of Divine Providence, on the judgement and\r\npatriotism which will guide your measures at a period particularly calling\r\nfor united councils and flexible exertions for the welfare of our country,\r\nand by assuring you of the fidelity and alacrity with which my cooperation\r\nwill be afforded.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nJames Madison\r\nNovember 5, 1811\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nIn calling you together sooner than a separation from your homes would\r\notherwise have been required I yielded to considerations drawn from the\r\nposture of our foreign affairs, and in fixing the present for the time of\r\nyour meeting regard was had to the probability of further developments of\r\nthe policy of the belligerent powers toward this country which might the\r\nmore unite the national councils in the measures to be pursued.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the last session of Congress it was hoped that the\r\nsuccessive confirmations of the extinction of the French decrees, so far as\r\nthey violated our neutral commerce, would have induced the Government of\r\nGreat Britain to repeal its orders in council, and thereby authorize a\r\nremoval of the existing obstructions to her commerce with the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nInstead of this reasonable step toward satisfaction and friendship between\r\nthe two nations, the orders were, at a moment when least to have been\r\nexpected, put into more rigorous execution; and it was communicated through\r\nthe British envoy just arrived that whilst the revocation of the edicts of\r\nFrance, as officially made known to the British Government, was denied to\r\nhave taken place, it was an indispensable condition of the repeal of the\r\nBritish orders that commerce should be restored to a footing that would\r\nadmit the productions and manufactures of Great Britain, when owned by\r\nneutrals, into markets shut against them by her enemy, the United States\r\nbeing given to understand that in the mean time a continuance of their\r\nnonimportation act would lead to measures of retaliation.\r\n\r\nAt a later date it has indeed appeared that a communication to the British\r\nGovernment of fresh evidence of the repeal of the French decrees against\r\nour neutral trade was followed by an intimation that it had been\r\ntransmitted to the British plenipotentiary here in order that it might\r\nreceive full consideration in the depending discussions. This communication\r\nappears not to have been received; but the transmission of it hither,\r\ninstead of founding on it an actual repeal of the orders or assurances that\r\nthe repeal would ensue, will not permit us to rely on any effective change\r\nin the British cabinet. To be ready to meet with cordiality satisfactory\r\nproofs of such a change, and to proceed in the mean time in adapting our\r\nmeasures to the views which have been disclosed through that minister will\r\nbest consult our whole duty.\r\n\r\nIn the unfriendly spirit of those disclosures indemnity and redress for\r\nother wrongs have continued to be withheld, and our coasts and the mouths\r\nof our harbors have again witnessed scenes not less derogatory to the\r\ndearest of our national rights than vexation to the regular course of our\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nAmong the occurrences produced by the conduct of British ships of war\r\nhovering on our coasts was an encounter between one of them and the\r\nAmerican frigate commanded by Captain Rodgers, rendered unavoidable on the\r\npart of the latter by a fire commenced without cause by the former, whose\r\ncommander is therefore alone chargeable with the blood unfortunately shed\r\nin maintaining the honor of the American flag. The proceedings of a court\r\nof inquiry requested by Captain Rodgers are communicated, together with\r\nthe correspondence relating to the occurrence, between the Secretary of\r\nState and His Britannic Majesty's envoy. To these are added the several\r\ncorrespondences which have passed on the subject of the British orders in\r\ncouncil, and to both the correspondence relating to the Floridas, in which\r\nCongress will be made acquainted with the interposition which the\r\nGovernment of Great Britain has thought proper to make against the\r\nproceeding of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe justice and fairness which have been evinced on the part of the United\r\nStates toward France, both before and since the revocation of her decrees,\r\nauthorized an expectation that her Government would have followed up that\r\nmeasure by all such others as were due to our reasonable claims, as well as\r\ndictated by its amicable professions. No proof, however, is yet given of an\r\nintention to repair the other wrongs done to the United States, and\r\nparticularly to restore the great amount of American property seized and\r\ncondemned under edicts which, though not affecting our neutral relations,\r\nand therefore not entering into questions between the United States and\r\nother belligerents, were nevertheless founded in such unjust principles\r\nthat the reparation ought to have been prompt and ample.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this and other demands of strict right on that nation, the\r\nUnited States have much reason to be dissatisfied with the rigorous and\r\nunexpected restrictions to which their trade with the French dominions has\r\nbeen subjected, and which, if not discontinued, will require at least\r\ncorresponding restrictions on importations from France into the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nOn all those subjects our minister plenipotentiary lately sent to Paris has\r\ncarried with him the necessary instructions, the result of which will be\r\ncommunicated to you, by ascertaining the ulterior policy of the French\r\nGovernment toward the United States, will enable you to adapt to it that of\r\nthe United States toward France.\r\n\r\nOur other foreign relations remain without unfavorable changes. With Russia\r\nthey are on the best footing of friendship. The ports of Sweden have\r\nafforded proofs of friendly dispositions toward our commerce in the\r\ncouncils of that nation also, and the information from our special minister\r\nto Denmark shews that the mission had been attended with valuable effects\r\nto our citizens, whose property had been so extensively violated and\r\nendangered by cruisers under the Danish flag.\r\n\r\nUnder the ominous indications which commanded attention it became a duty to\r\nexert the means committed to the executive department in providing for the\r\ngeneral security. The works of defense on our maritime frontier have\r\naccordingly been prosecuted with an activity leaving little to be added for\r\nthe completion of the most important ones, and, as particularly suited for\r\ncooperation in emergencies, a portion of the gun boats have in particular\r\nharbors been ordered into use. The ships of war before in commission, with\r\nthe addition of a frigate, have been chiefly employed as a cruising guard\r\nto the rights of our coast, and such a disposition has been made of our\r\nland forces as was thought to promise the services most appropriate and\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\nIn this disposition is included a force consisting of regulars and militia,\r\nembodied in the Indiana Territory and marched toward our northwestern\r\nfrontier. This measure was made requisite by several murders and\r\ndepredations committed by Indians, but more especially by the menacing\r\npreparations and aspect of a combination of them on the Wabash, under the\r\ninfluence and direction of a fanatic of the Shawanese tribe. With these\r\nexceptions the Indian tribes retain their peaceable dispositions toward us,\r\nand their usual pursuits.\r\n\r\nI must now add that the period is arrived which claims from the legislative\r\nguardians of the national rights a system of more ample provisions for\r\nmaintaining them. Notwithstanding the scrupulous justice, the protracted\r\nmoderation, and the multiplied efforts on the part of the United States to\r\nsubstitute for the accumulating dangers to the peace of the two countries\r\nall the mutual advantages of reestablished friendship and confidence, we\r\nhave seen that the British cabinet perseveres not only in withholding a\r\nremedy for other wrongs, so long and so loudly calling for it, but in the\r\nexecution, brought home to the threshold of our territory, of measures\r\nwhich under existing circumstances have the character as well as the effect\r\nof war on our lawful commerce.\r\n\r\nWith this evidence of hostile inflexibility in trampling on rights which no\r\nindependent nation can relinquish, Congress will feel the duty of putting\r\nthe United States into an armor and an attitude demanded by the crisis, and\r\ncorresponding with the national spirit and expectations.\r\n\r\nI recommend, accordingly, that adequate provisions be made for filling the\r\nranks and prolonging the enlistments of the regular troops; for an\r\nauxiliary force to be engaged for a more limited term; for the acceptance\r\nof volunteer corps, whose patriotic ardor may court a participation in\r\nurgent services; for detachments as they may be wanted of other portions of\r\nthe militia, and for such a preparation of the great body as will\r\nproportion its usefulness to its intrinsic capacities. Nor can the occasion\r\nfail to remind you of the importance of those military seminaries which in\r\nevery event will form a valuable and frugal part of our military\r\nestablishment.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of cannon and small arms has proceeded with due success,\r\nand the stock and resources of all the necessary munitions are adequate to\r\nemergencies. It will not be inexpedient, however, for Congress to authorize\r\nan enlargement of them.\r\n\r\nYour attention will of course be drawn to such provisions on the subject of\r\nour naval force as may be required for the services to which it may be best\r\nadapted. I submit to Congress the seasonableness also of an authority to\r\naugment the stock of such materials as are imperishable in their nature, or\r\nmay not at once be attainable.\r\n\r\nIn contemplating the scenes which distinguish this momentous epoch, and\r\nestimating their claims to our attention, it is impossible to overlook\r\nthose developing themselves among the great communities which occupy the\r\nsouthern portion of our own hemisphere and extend into our neighborhood. An\r\nenlarged philanthropy and an enlightened forecast concur in imposing on the\r\nnational councils an obligation to take a deep interest in their destinies,\r\nto cherish reciprocal sentiments of good will, to regard the progress of\r\nevents, and not to be unprepared for whatever order of things may be\r\nultimately established.\r\n\r\nUnder another aspect of our situation the early attention of Congress will\r\nbe due to the expediency of further guards against evasions and infractions\r\nof our commercial laws. The practice of smuggling, which is odious\r\neverywhere, and particularly criminal in free governments, where, the laws\r\nbeing made by all for the good of all, a fraud is committed on every\r\nindividual as well as on the state, attains its utmost guilt when it blends\r\nwith a pursuit of ignominious gain a treacherous subserviency, in the\r\ntransgressors, to a foreign policy adverse to that of their own country. It\r\nis then that the virtuous indignation of the public should be enabled to\r\nmanifest itself through the regular animadversions of the most competent\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\nTo secure greater respect to our mercantile flag, and to the honest\r\ninterests which it covers, it is expedient also that it be made punishable\r\nin our citizens to accept licenses from foreign governments for a trade\r\nunlawfully interdicted by them to other American citizens, or to trade\r\nunder false colors or papers of any sort.\r\n\r\nA prohibition is equally called for against the acceptance by our citizens\r\nof special licenses to be used in a trade with the United States, and\r\nagainst the admission into particular ports of the United States of vessels\r\nfrom foreign countries authorized to trade with particular ports only.\r\n\r\nAlthough other subjects will press more immediately on your deliberations,\r\na portion of them can not but be well bestowed on the just and sound policy\r\nof securing to our manufactures the success they have attained, and are\r\nstill attaining, in some degree, under the impulse of causes not permanent,\r\nand to our navigation, the fair extent of which is at present abridged by\r\nthe unequal regulations of foreign governments.\r\n\r\nBesides the reasonableness of saving our manufactures from sacrifices which\r\na change of circumstances might bring on them, the national interest\r\nrequires that, with regard to such articles at least as belong to our\r\ndefense and our primary wants, we should not be left in unnecessary\r\ndependence on external supplies. And whilst foreign governments adhere to\r\nthe existing discriminations in their ports against our navigation, and\r\nan equality or lesser discrimination is enjoyed by their navigation in\r\nour ports, the effect can not be mistaken, because it has been seriously\r\nfelt by our shipping interests; and in proportion as this takes place the\r\nadvantages of an independent conveyance of our products to foreign\r\nmarkets and of a growing body of mariners trained by their occupations for\r\nthe service of their country in times of danger must be diminished.\r\n\r\nThe receipts into the Treasury during the year ending on the 30th day of\r\nSeptember last have exceeded $13.5 millions, and have enabled us to defray\r\nthe current expenses, including the interest on the public debt, and to\r\nreimburse more than $5 millions of the principal without recurring to the\r\nloan authorized by the act of the last session. The temporary loan\r\nobtained in the latter end of the year 1810 has also been reimbursed, and\r\nis not included in that amount.\r\n\r\nThe decrease of revenue arising from the situation of our commerce, and the\r\nextraordinary expenses which have and may become necessary, must be taken\r\ninto view in making commensurate provisions for the ensuing year; and I\r\nrecommend to your consideration the propriety of insuring a sufficiency of\r\nannual revenue at least to defray the ordinary expenses of Government, and\r\nto pay the interest on the public debt, including that on new loans which\r\nmay be authorized.\r\n\r\nI can not close this communication without expressing my deep sense of the\r\ncrisis in which you are assembled, my confidence in a wise and honorable\r\nresult to your deliberations, and assurances of the faithful zeal with\r\nwhich my cooperating duties will be discharged, invoking at the same time\r\nthe blessing of Heaven on our beloved country and on all the means that may\r\nbe employed in vindicating its rights and advancing its welfare.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nJames Madison\r\nNovember 4, 1812\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nOn our present meeting it is my first duty to invite your attention to the\r\nprovidential favors which our country has experienced in the unusual degree\r\nof health dispensed to its inhabitants, and in the rich abundance with\r\nwhich the earth has rewarded the labors bestowed on it. In the successful\r\ncultivation of other branches of industry, and in the progress of general\r\nimprovement favorable to the national prosperity, there is just occasion\r\nalso for our mutual congratulations and thankfulness.\r\n\r\nWith these blessings are necessarily mingled the pressures and vicissitudes\r\nincident to the state of war into which the United States have been forced\r\nby the perseverance of a foreign power in its system of injustice and\r\naggression.\r\n\r\nPrevious to its declaration it was deemed proper, as a measure of\r\nprecaution and forecast, that a considerable force should be placed in the\r\nMichigan Territory with a general view to its security, and, in the event\r\nof war, to such operations in the uppermost Canada as would intercept the\r\nhostile influence of Great Britain over the savages, obtain the command of\r\nthe lake on which that part of Canada borders, and maintain cooperating\r\nrelations with such forces as might be most conveniently employed against\r\nother parts.\r\n\r\nBrigadier-General Hull was charged with this provisional service, having\r\nunder his command a body of troops composed of regulars and of volunteers\r\nfrom the State of Ohio. Having reached his destination after his knowledge\r\nof the war, and possessing discretionary authority to act offensively, he\r\npassed into the neighboring territory of the enemy with a prospect of easy\r\nand victorious progress. The expedition, nevertheless, terminated\r\nunfortunately, not only in a retreat to the town and fort of Detroit, but\r\nin the surrender of both and of the gallant corps commanded by that\r\nofficer. The causes of this painful reverse will be investigated by a\r\nmilitary tribunal.\r\n\r\nA distinguishing feature in the operations which preceded and followed this\r\nadverse event is the use made by the enemy of the merciless savages under\r\ntheir influence. Whilst the benevolent policy of the United States\r\ninvariably recommended peace and promoted civilization among that wretched\r\nportion of the human race, and was making exertions to dissuade them from\r\ntaking either side in the war, the enemy has not scrupled to call to his\r\naid their ruthless ferocity, armed with the horrors of those instruments of\r\ncarnage and torture which are known to spare neither age nor sex. In this\r\noutrage against the laws of honorable war and against the feelings sacred\r\nto humanity the British commanders can not resort to a plea of retaliation,\r\nfor it is committed in the face of our example. They can not mitigate it by\r\ncalling it a self-defense against men in arms, for it embraces the most\r\nshocking butcheries of defenseless families. Nor can it be pretended that\r\nthey are not answerable for the atrocities perpetrated, since the savages\r\nare employed with a knowledge, and even with menaces, that their fury could\r\nnot be controlled. Such is the spectacle which the deputed authorities of a\r\nnation boasting its religion and morality have not been restrained from\r\npresenting to an enlightened age.\r\n\r\nThe misfortune at Detroit was not, however, without a consoling effect. It\r\nwas followed by signal proofs that the national spirit rises according to\r\nthe pressure on it. The loss of an important post and of the brave men\r\nsurrendered with it inspired everywhere new ardor and determination. In the\r\nStates and districts least remote it was no sooner known than every citizen\r\nwas ready to fly with his arms at once to protect his brethren against the\r\nblood-thirsty savages let loose by the enemy on an extensive frontier, and\r\nto convert a partial calamity into a source of invigorated efforts. This\r\npatriotic zeal, which it was necessary rather to limit than excite, has\r\nembodied an ample force from the States of Kentucky and Ohio and from parts\r\nof Pennsylvania and Virginia. It is placed, with the addition of a few\r\nregulars, under the command of Brigadier-General Harrison, who possesses\r\nthe entire confidence of his fellow soldiers, among whom are citizens, some\r\nof them volunteers in the ranks, not less distinguished by their political\r\nstations than by their personal merits. The greater portion of this force\r\nis proceeding in relieving an important frontier post, and in several\r\nincidental operations against hostile tribes of savages, rendered\r\nindispensable by the subserviency into which they had been seduced by the\r\nenemy--a seduction the more cruel as it could not fail to impose a\r\nnecessity of precautionary severities against those who yielded to it.\r\n\r\nAt a recent date an attack was made on a post of the enemy near Niagara by\r\na detachment of the regular and other forces under the command of\r\nMajor-General Van Rensselaer, of the militia of the State of New York. The\r\nattack, it appears, was ordered in compliance with the ardor of the troops,\r\nwho executed it with distinguished gallantry, and were for a time\r\nvictorious; but not receiving the expected support, they were compelled to\r\nyield to reenforcements of British regulars and savages. Our loss has been\r\nconsiderable, and is deeply to be lamented. That of the enemy, less\r\nascertained, will be the more felt, as it includes among the killed the\r\ncommanding general, who was also the governor of the Province, and was\r\nsustained by veteran troops from unexperienced soldiers, who must daily\r\nimprove in the duties of the field.\r\n\r\nOur expectation of gaining the command of the Lakes by the invasion of\r\nCanada from Detroit having been disappointed, measures were instantly taken\r\nto provide on them a naval force superior to that of the enemy. From the\r\ntalents and activity of the officer charged with this object everything\r\nthat can be done may be expected. Should the present season not admit of\r\ncomplete success, the progress made will insure for the next a naval\r\nascendancy where it is essential to our permanent peace with and control\r\nover the savages.\r\n\r\nAmong the incidents to the measures of the war I am constrained to advert\r\nto the refusal of the governors of Maine and Connecticut to furnish the\r\nrequired detachments of militia toward the defense of the maritime\r\nfrontier. The refusal was founded on a novel and unfortunate exposition of\r\nthe provisions of the Constitution relating to the militia. The\r\ncorrespondences which will be laid before you contain the requisite\r\ninformation on the subject. It is obvious that if the authority of the\r\nUnited States to call into service and command the militia for the public\r\ndefense can be thus frustrated, even in a state of declared war and of\r\ncourse under apprehensions of invasion preceding war, they are not one\r\nnation for the purpose most of all requiring it, and that the public safety\r\nmay have no other resource than in those large and permanent military\r\nestablishments which are forbidden by the principles of our free\r\ngovernment, and against the necessity of which the militia were meant to be\r\na constitutional bulwark.\r\n\r\nOn the coasts and on the ocean the war has been as successful as\r\ncircumstances inseparable from its early stages could promise. Our public\r\nships and private cruisers, by their activity, and, where there was\r\noccasion, by their intrepidity, have made the enemy sensible of the\r\ndifference between a reciprocity of captures and the long confinement of\r\nthem to their side. Our trade, with little exception, has safely reached\r\nour ports, having been much favored in it by the course pursued by a\r\nsquadron of our frigates under the command of Commodore Rodgers, and in the\r\ninstance in which skill and bravery were more particularly tried with those\r\nof the enemy the American flag had an auspicious triumph. The frigate\r\nConstitution, commanded by Captain Hull, after a close and short engagement\r\ncompletely disabled and captured a British frigate, gaining for that\r\nofficer and all on board a praise which can not be too liberally bestowed,\r\nnot merely for the victory actually achieved, but for that prompt and cool\r\nexertion of commanding talents which, giving to courage its highest\r\ncharacter, and to the force applied its full effect, proved that more could\r\nhave been done in a contest requiring more.\r\n\r\nAnxious to abridge the evils from which a state of war can not be exempt, I\r\nlost no time after it was declared in conveying to the British Government\r\nthe terms on which its progress might be arrested, without awaiting the\r\ndelays of a formal and final pacification, and our charge d'affaires at\r\nLondon was at the same time authorized to agree to an armistice founded\r\nupon them. These terms required that the orders in council should be\r\nrepealed as they affected the United States, without a revival of blockades\r\nviolating acknowledged rules, and that there should be an immediate\r\ndischarge of American sea men from British ships, and a stop to impressment\r\nfrom American ships, with an understanding that an exclusion of the sea men\r\nof each nation from the ships of the other should be stipulated, and that\r\nthe armistice should be improved into a definitive and comprehensive\r\nadjustment of depending controversies.\r\n\r\nAlthough a repeal of the orders susceptible of explanations meeting the\r\nviews of this Government had taken place before this pacific advance was\r\ncommunicated to that of Great Britain, the advance was declined from an\r\navowed repugnance to a suspension of the practice of impressments during\r\nthe armistice, and without any intimation that the arrangement proposed\r\nwith regard to sea men would be accepted. Whether the subsequent\r\ncommunications from this Government, affording an occasion for\r\nreconsidering the subject on the part of Great Britain, will be viewed\r\nin a more favorable light or received in a more accommodating spirit\r\nremains to be known. It would be unwise to relax our measures in any\r\nrespect on a presumption of such a result.\r\n\r\nThe documents from the Department of State which relate to this subject\r\nwill give a view also of the propositions for an armistice which have been\r\nreceived here, one of them from the authorities at Halifax and in Canada,\r\nthe other from the British Government itself through Admiral Warren, and of\r\nthe grounds on which neither of them could be accepted.\r\n\r\nOur affairs with France retain the posture which they held at my last\r\ncommunications to you. Notwithstanding the authorized expectations of an\r\nearly as well as favorable issue to the discussions on foot, these have\r\nbeen procrastinated to the latest date. The only intervening occurrence\r\nmeriting attention is the promulgation of a French decree purporting to be\r\na definitive repeal of the Berlin and Milan decrees. This proceeding,\r\nalthough made the ground of the repeal of the British orders in council, is\r\nrendered by the time and manner of it liable to many objections.\r\n\r\nThe final communications from our special minister to Denmark afford\r\nfurther proofs of the good effects of his mission, and of the amicable\r\ndisposition of the Danish Government. From Russia we have the satisfaction\r\nto receive assurances of continued friendship, and that it will not be\r\naffected by the rupture between the United States and Great Britain. Sweden\r\nalso professes sentiments favorable to the subsisting harmony.\r\n\r\nWith the Barbary Powers, excepting that of Algiers, our affairs remain on\r\nthe ordinary footing. The consul-general residing with that Regency has\r\nsuddenly and without cause been banished, together with all the American\r\ncitizens found there. Whether this was the transitory effect of capricious\r\ndespotism or the first act of predetermined hostility is not ascertained.\r\nPrecautions were taken by the consul on the latter supposition.\r\n\r\nThe Indian tribes not under foreign instigations remain at peace, and\r\nreceive the civilizing attentions which have proved so beneficial to them.\r\n\r\nWith a view to that vigorous prosecution of the war to which our national\r\nfaculties are adequate, the attention of Congress will be particularly\r\ndrawn to the insufficiency of existing provisions for filling up the\r\nmilitary establishment. Such is the happy condition of our country, arising\r\nfrom the facility of subsistence and the high wages for every species of\r\noccupation, that notwithstanding the augmented inducements provided at the\r\nlast session, a partial success only has attended the recruiting service.\r\nThe deficiency has been necessarily supplied during the campaign by other\r\nthan regular troops, with all the inconveniences and expense incident to\r\nthem. The remedy lies in establishing more favorably for the private\r\nsoldier the proportion between his recompense and the term of his\r\nenlistment, and it is a subject which can not too soon or too seriously be\r\ntaken into consideration.\r\n\r\nThe same insufficiency has been experienced in the provisions for\r\nvolunteers made by an act of the last session. The recompense for the\r\nservice required in this case is still less attractive than in the other,\r\nand although patriotism alone has sent into the field some valuable corps\r\nof that description, those alone who can afford the sacrifice can be\r\nreasonably expected to yield to that impulse.\r\n\r\nIt will merit consideration also whether as auxiliary to the security of\r\nour frontiers corps may not be advantageously organized with a restriction\r\nof their services to particular districts convenient to them, and whether\r\nthe local and occasional services of mariners and others in the sea port\r\ntowns under a similar organization would not be a provident addition to the\r\nmeans of their defense.\r\n\r\nI recommend a provision for an increase of the general officers of the\r\nArmy, the deficiency of which has been illustrated by the number and\r\ndistance of separate commands which the course of the war and the\r\nadvantage of the service have required.\r\n\r\nAnd I can not press too strongly on the earliest attention of the\r\nLegislature the importance of the reorganization of the staff establishment\r\nwith a view to render more distinct and definite the relations and\r\nresponsibilities of its several departments. That there is room for\r\nimprovements which will materially promote both economy and success in what\r\nappertains to the Army and the war is equally inculcated by the examples of\r\nother countries and by the experience of our own.\r\n\r\nA revision of the militia laws for the purpose of rendering them more\r\nsystematic and better adapting them to emergencies of the war is at this\r\ntime particularly desirable.\r\n\r\nOf the additional ships authorized to be fitted for service, two will be\r\nshortly ready to sail, a third is under repair, and delay will be avoided\r\nin the repair of the residue. Of the appropriations for the purchase of\r\nmaterials for ship building, the greater part has been applied to that\r\nobject and the purchase will be continued with the balance.\r\n\r\nThe enterprising spirit which has characterized our naval force and its\r\nsuccess, both in restraining insults and depredations on our coasts and in\r\nreprisals on the enemy, will not fail to recommend an enlargement of it.\r\n\r\nThere being reason to believe that the act prohibiting the acceptance of\r\nBritish licenses is not a sufficient guard against the use of them, for\r\npurposes favorable to the interests and views of the enemy, further\r\nprovisions on that subject are highly important. Nor is it less so that\r\npenal enactments should be provided for cases of corrupt and perfidious\r\nintercourse with the enemy, not amounting to treason nor yet embraced by\r\nany statutory provisions.\r\n\r\nA considerable number of American vessels which were in England when the\r\nrevocation of the orders in council took place were laden with British\r\nmanufactures under an erroneous impression that the non-importation act\r\nwould immediately cease to operate, and have arrived in the United States.\r\nIt did not appear proper to exercise on unforeseen cases of such magnitude\r\nthe powers vested in the Treasury Department to mitigate forfeitures\r\nwithout previously affording to Congress an opportunity of making on the\r\nsubject such provision as they may think proper. In their decision they\r\nwill doubtless equally consult what is due to equitable considerations and\r\nto the public interest.\r\n\r\nThe receipts into the Treasury during the year ending on the 30th of\r\nSeptember last have exceeded $16.5 millions, which have been sufficient\r\nto defray all the demands on the Treasury to that day, including a\r\nnecessary reimbursement of near $3 millions of the principal of the\r\npublic debt. In these receipts is included a sum of near $5.85 millions,\r\nreceived on account of the loans authorized by the acts of the last\r\nsession; the whole sum actually obtained on loan amounts to $11 millions,\r\nthe residue of which, being receivable subsequent to the 30th of September\r\nlast, will, together with the current revenue, enable us to defray all the\r\nexpenses of this year.\r\n\r\nThe duties on the late unexpected importations of British manufactures will\r\nrender the revenue of the ensuing year more productive than could have been\r\nanticipated.\r\n\r\nThe situation of our country, fellow citizens, is not without its\r\ndifficulties, though it abounds in animating considerations, of which the\r\nview here presented of our pecuniary resources is an example. With more\r\nthan one nation we have serious and unsettled controversies, and with one,\r\npowerful in the means and habits of war, we are at war. The spirit and\r\nstrength of the nation are nevertheless equal to the support of all its\r\nrights, and to carry it through all its trials. They can be met in that\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\nAbove all, we have the inestimable consolation of knowing that the war in\r\nwhich we are actually engaged is a war neither of ambition nor of vain\r\nglory; that it is waged not in violation of the rights of others, but in\r\nthe maintenance of our own; that it was preceded by a patience without\r\nexample under wrongs accumulating without end, and that it was finally not\r\ndeclared until every hope of averting it was extinguished by the transfer\r\nof the British scepter into new hands clinging to former councils, and\r\nuntil declarations were reiterated to the last hour, through the British\r\nenvoy here, that the hostile edicts against our commercial rights and our\r\nmaritime independence would not be revoked; nay, that they could not be\r\nrevoked without violating the obligations of Great Britain to other powers,\r\nas well as to her own interests.\r\n\r\nTo have shrunk under such circumstances from manly resistance would have\r\nbeen a degradation blasting our best and proudest hopes; it would have\r\nstruck us from the high rank where the virtuous struggles of our fathers\r\nhad placed us, and have betrayed the magnificent legacy which we hold in\r\ntrust for future generations. It would have acknowledged that on the\r\nelement which forms three-fourths of the globe we inhabit, and where all\r\nindependent nations have equal and common rights, the American people were\r\nnot an independent people, but colonists and vassals.\r\n\r\nIt was at this moment and with such an alternative that war was chosen. The\r\nnation felt the necessity of it, and called for it. The appeal was\r\naccordingly made, in a just cause, to the Just and All-powerful Being who\r\nholds in His hand the chain of events and the destiny of nations.\r\n\r\nIt remains only that, faithful to ourselves, entangled in no connections\r\nwith the views of other powers, and ever ready to accept peace from the\r\nhand of justice, we prosecute the war with united counsels and with the\r\nample faculties of the nation until peace be so obtained and as the\r\nonly means under the Divine blessing of speedily obtaining it.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nJames Madison\r\nDecember 7, 1813\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nIn meeting you at the present interesting conjuncture it would have been\r\nhighly satisfactory if I could have communicated a favorable result to the\r\nmission charged with negotiations for restoring peace. It was a just\r\nexpectation, from the respect due to the distinguished Sovereign who had\r\ninvited them by his offer of mediation, from the readiness with which the\r\ninvitation was accepted on the part of the United States, and from the\r\npledge to be found in an act of their Legislature for the liberality which\r\ntheir plenipotentiaries would carry into the negotiations, that no time\r\nwould be lost by the British Government in embracing the experiment for\r\nhastening a stop to the effusion of blood. A prompt and cordial acceptance\r\nof the mediation on that side was the less to be doubted, as it was of a\r\nnature not to submit rights or pretensions on either side to the decision\r\nof an umpire, but to afford merely an opportunity, honorable and desirable\r\nto both, for discussing and, if possible, adjusting them for the interest\r\nof both.\r\n\r\nThe British cabinet, either mistaking our desire of peace for a dread of\r\nBritish power or misled by other fallacious calculations, has disappointed\r\nthis reasonable anticipation. No communications from our envoys having\r\nreached us, no information on the subject has been received from that\r\nsource; but it is known that the mediation was declined in the first\r\ninstance, and there is no evidence, notwithstanding the lapse of time, that\r\na change of disposition in the British councils has taken place or is to be\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances a nation proud of its rights and conscious of its\r\nstrength has no choice but an exertion of the one in support of the other.\r\n\r\nTo this determination the best encouragement is derived from the success\r\nwith which it has pleased the Almighty to bless our arms both on the land\r\nand on the water.\r\n\r\nWhilst proofs have been continued of the enterprise and skill of our\r\ncruisers, public and private, on the ocean, and a trophy gained in the\r\ncapture of a British by an American vessel of war, after an action giving\r\ncelebrity to the name of the victorious commander, the great inland waters\r\non which the enemy were also to be encountered have presented achievements\r\nof our naval arms as brilliant in their character as they have been\r\nimportant in their consequences.\r\n\r\nOn Lake Erie, the squadron under command of Captain Perry having met the\r\nBritish squadron of superior force, a sanguinary conflict ended in the\r\ncapture of the whole. The conduct of that officer, adroit as it was daring,\r\nand which was so well seconded by his comrades, justly entitles them to the\r\nadmiration and gratitude of their country, and will fill an early page in\r\nits naval annals with a victory never surpassed in luster, however much it\r\nmay have been in magnitude.\r\n\r\nOn Lake Ontario the caution of the British commander, favored by\r\ncontingencies, frustrated the efforts of the American commander to bring on\r\na decisive action. Captain Chauncey was able, however, to establish an\r\nascendancy on that important theater, and to prove by the manner in which\r\nhe effected everything possible that opportunities only were wanted for a\r\nmore shining display of his own talents and the gallantry of those under\r\nhis command.\r\n\r\nThe success on Lake Erie having opened a passage to the territory of the\r\nenemy, the officer commanding the Northwestern army transferred the war\r\nthither, and rapidly pursuing the hostile troops, fleeing with their savage\r\nassociates, forced a general action, which quickly terminated in the\r\ncapture of the British and dispersion of the savage force.\r\n\r\nThis result is signally honorable to Major-General Harrison, by whose\r\nmilitary talents it was prepared; to Colonel Johnson and his mounted\r\nvolunteers, whose impetuous onset gave a decisive blow to the ranks of the\r\nenemy, and to the spirit of the volunteer militia, equally brave and\r\npatriotic, who bore an interesting part in the scene; more especially to\r\nthe chief magistrate of Kentucky, at the head of them, whose heroism\r\nsignalized in the war which established the independence of his country,\r\nsought at an advanced age a share in hardships and battles for maintaining\r\nits rights and its safely.\r\n\r\nThe effect of these successes has been to rescue the inhabitants of\r\nMichigan from their oppressions, aggravated by gross infractions of\r\nthe capitulation which subjected them to a foreign power; to alienate\r\nthe savages of numerous tribes from the enemy, by whom they were\r\ndisappointed and abandoned, and to relieve an extensive region of country\r\nfrom a merciless warfare which desolated its frontiers and imposed on its\r\ncitizens the most harassing services.\r\n\r\nIn consequences of our naval superiority on Lake Ontario and the\r\nopportunity afforded by it for concentrating our forces by water,\r\noperations which had been provisionally planned were set on foot against\r\nthe possessions of the enemy on the St. Lawrence. Such, however, was the\r\ndelay produced in the first instance by adverse weather of unusual violence\r\nand continuance and such the circumstances attending the final movements of\r\nthe army, that the prospect, at one time so favorable, was not realized.\r\n\r\nThe cruelty of the enemy in enlisting the savages into a war with a nation\r\ndesirous of mutual emulation in mitigating its calamities has not been\r\nconfined to any one quarter. Wherever they could be turned against us no\r\nexertions to effect it have been spared. On our southwestern border the\r\nCreek tribes, who, yielding to our persevering endeavors, were gradually\r\nacquiring more civilized habits, became the unfortunate victims of\r\nseduction. A war in that quarter has been the consequence, infuriated by a\r\nbloody fanaticism recently propagated among them. It was necessary to crush\r\nsuch a war before it could spread among the contiguous tribes and before it\r\ncould favor enterprises of the enemy into that vicinity. With this view a\r\nforce was called into the service of the United States from the States of\r\nGeorgia and Tennessee, which, with the nearest regular troops and other\r\ncorps from the Massachussets Territory, might not only chastise the savages\r\ninto present peace but make a lasting impression on their fears.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the expedition, as far as is yet known, corresponds with\r\nthe martial zeal with which it was espoused, and the best hopes of a\r\nsatisfactory issue are authorized by the complete success with which a\r\nwell-planned enterprise was executed against a body of hostile savages by a\r\ndetachment of the volunteer militia of Tennessee, under the gallant\r\ncommand of General Coffee, and by a still more important victory over a\r\nlarger body of them, gained under the immediate command of Major-General\r\nJackson, an officer equally distinguished for his patriotism and his\r\nmilitary talents.\r\n\r\nThe systematic perseverance of the enemy in courting the aid of the savages\r\nin all quarters had the natural effect of kindling their ordinary\r\npropensity to war into a passion, which, even among those best disposed\r\ntoward the United States, was ready, if not employed on our side, to be\r\nturned against us. A departure from our protracted forbearance to accept\r\nthe services tendered by them has thus been forced upon us. But in yielding\r\nto it the retaliation has been mitigated as much as possible, both in its\r\nextent and in its character, stopping far short of the example of the\r\nenemy, who owe the advantages they have occasionally gained in battle\r\nchiefly to the number of their savage associates, and who have not\r\ncontrolled them either from their usual practice of indiscriminate\r\nmassacre on defenseless inhabitants or from scenes of carnage without a\r\nparallel on prisoners to the British arms, guarded by all the laws of\r\nhumanity and of honorable war. For these enormities the enemy are equally\r\nresponsible, whether with the power to prevent them they want the will or\r\nwith the knowledge of a want of power they still avail themselves of such\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\nIn other respects the enemy are pursuing a course which threatens\r\nconsequences most afflicting to humanity.\r\n\r\nA standing law of Great Britain naturalizes, as is well known, all aliens\r\ncomplying with conditions limited to a shorter period than those required\r\nby the United States, and naturalized subjects are in war employed by her\r\nGovernment in common with native subjects. In a contiguous British Province\r\nregulations promulgated since the commencement of the war compel citizens\r\nof the United States being there under certain circumstances to bear arms,\r\nwhilst of the native emigrants from the United States, who compose much of\r\nthe population of the Province, a number have actually borne arms against\r\nthe United States within their limits, some of whom, after having done so,\r\nhave become prisoners of war, and are now in our possession. The British\r\ncommander in that Province, nevertheless, with the sanction, as appears, of\r\nhis Government, thought proper to select from American prisoners of war and\r\nsend to Great Britain for trial as criminals a number of individuals who\r\nhad emigrated from the British dominions long prior to the state of war\r\nbetween the two nations, who had incorporated themselves into our\r\npolitical society in the modes recognized by the law and the practice of\r\nGreat Britain, and who were made prisoners of war under the banners of\r\ntheir adopted country, fighting for its rights and its safety.\r\n\r\nThe protection due to these citizens requiring an effectual interposition\r\nin their behalf, a like number of British prisoners of war were put into\r\nconfinement, with a notification that they would experience whatever\r\nviolence might be committed on the American prisoners of war sent to Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\nIt was hoped that this necessary consequence of the step unadvisedly taken\r\non the part of Great Britain would have led her Government to reflect on\r\nthe inconsistencies of its conduct, and that a sympathy with the British,\r\nif not with the American, sufferers would have arrested the cruel career\r\nopened by its example.\r\n\r\nThis was unhappily not the case. In violation both of consistency and of\r\nhumanity, American officers and non-commissioned officers in double the\r\nnumber of the British soldiers confined here were ordered into close\r\nconfinement, with formal notice that in the event of a retaliation for the\r\ndeath which might be inflicted on the prisoners of war sent to Great\r\nBritain for trial the officers so confined would be put to death also. It\r\nwas notified at the same time that the commanders of the British fleets and\r\narmies on our coasts are instructed in the same event to proceed with a\r\ndestructive severity against our towns and their inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThat no doubt might be left with the enemy of our adherence to the\r\nretaliatory resort imposed on us, a correspondent number of British\r\nofficers, prisoners of war in our hands, were immediately put into close\r\nconfinement to abide the fate of those confined by the enemy, and the\r\nBritish Government was apprised of the determination of this Government to\r\nretaliate any other proceedings against us contrary to the legitimate modes\r\nof warfare.\r\n\r\nIt is fortunate for the United States that they have it in their power to\r\nmeet the enemy in this deplorable contest as it is honorable to them that\r\nthey do not join in it but under the most imperious obligations, and with\r\nthe humane purpose of effectuating a return to the established usages of\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nThe views of the French Government on the subjects which have been so long\r\ncommitted to negotiation have received no elucidation since the close of\r\nyour late session. The minister plenipotentiary of the United States at\r\nParis had not been enabled by proper opportunities to press the objects of\r\nhis mission as prescribed by his instructions.\r\n\r\nThe militia being always to be regarded as the great bulwark of defense and\r\nsecurity for free states, and the Constitution having wisely committed to\r\nthe national authority a use of that force as the best provision against an\r\nunsafe military establishment, as well as a resource peculiarly adapted to\r\na country having the extent and the exposure of the United States, I\r\nrecommend to Congress a revision of the militia laws for the purpose of\r\nsecuring more effectually the services of all detachments called into the\r\nemployment and placed under the Government of the United States.\r\n\r\nIt will deserve the consideration of Congress also whether among other\r\nimprovements in the militia laws justice does not require a regulation,\r\nunder due precautions, for defraying the expense incident to the first\r\nassembling as well as the subsequent movements of detachments called into\r\nthe national service.\r\n\r\nTo give to our vessels of war, public and private, the requisite advantage\r\nin their cruises, it is of much importance that they should have, both for\r\nthemselves and their prizes, the use of the ports and markets of friendly\r\npowers. With this view, I recommend to Congress the expediency of such\r\nlegal provisions as may supply the defects or remove the doubts of the\r\nExecutive authority, to allow to the cruisers of other powers at war with\r\nenemies of the United States such use of the American ports as may\r\ncorrespond with the privileges allowed by such powers to American\r\ncruisers.\r\n\r\nDuring the year ending on the 30th of September last the receipts into the\r\nTreasury have exceeded $37.5 millions, of which near $24 millions were the\r\nproduce of loans. After meeting all demands for the public service there\r\nremained in the Treasury on that day near $7 millions. Under the\r\nauthority contained in the act of the 2nd of August last for borrowing\r\n$7.5 millions, that sum has been obtained on terms more favorable to the\r\nUnited States than those of the preceding loans made during the present\r\nyear. Further sums to a considerable amount will be necessary to be\r\nobtained in the same way during the ensuing year, and from the increased\r\ncapital of the country, from the fidelity with which the public\r\nengagements have been kept and the public credit maintained, it may be\r\nexpected on good grounds that the necessary pecuniary supplies will\r\nnot be wanting.\r\n\r\nThe expenses of the current year, from the multiplied operations falling\r\nwithin it, have necessarily been extensive; but on a just estimate of the\r\ncampaign in which the mass of them has been incurred the cost will not be\r\nfound disproportionate to the advantages which have been gained. The\r\ncampaign has, indeed, in its latter stages in one quarter been less\r\nfavorable than was expected, but in addition to the importance of our naval\r\nsuccess the progress of the campaign has been filled with incidents highly\r\nhonorable to the American arms.\r\n\r\nThe attacks of the enemy on Craney Island, on Fort Meigs, on Sacketts\r\nHarbor, and on Sandusky have been vigorously and successfully repulsed; nor\r\nhave they in any case succeeded on either frontier excepting when directed\r\nagainst the peaceable dwellings of individuals or villages unprepared or\r\nundefended.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the movements of the American Army have been followed by\r\nthe reduction of York, and of Forts George, Erie, and Malden; by the\r\nrecovery of Detroit and the extinction of the Indian war in the West, and\r\nby the occupancy or command of a large portion of Upper Canada. Battles\r\nhave also been fought on the borders of the St. Lawrence, which, though not\r\naccomplishing their entire objects, reflect honor on the discipline and\r\nprowess of our soldiery, the best auguries of eventual victory. In the same\r\nscale are to be placed the late successes in the South over one of the most\r\npowerful, which had become one of the most hostile also, of the Indian\r\ntribes.\r\n\r\nIt would be improper to close this communication without expressing a\r\nthankfulness in which all ought to unite for the abundance; for the\r\npreservation of our internal tranquillity, and the stability of our free\r\ninstitutions, and, above all, for the light of divine truth and the\r\nprotection of every man's conscience in the enjoyment of it. And although\r\namong our blessings we can not number an exemption from the evils of war,\r\nyet these will never be regarded as the greatest of evils by the friends of\r\nliberty and of the rights of nations. Our country has before preferred them\r\nto the degraded condition which was the alternative when the sword was\r\ndrawn in the cause which gave birth to our national independence, and none\r\nwho contemplate the magnitude and feel the value of that glorious event\r\nwill shrink from a struggle to maintain the high and happy ground on which\r\nit placed the American people.\r\n\r\nWith all good citizens the justice and necessity of resisting wrongs and\r\nusurpations no longer to be borne will sufficiently outweigh the privations\r\nand sacrifices inseparable from a state of war. But it is a reflection,\r\nmoreover, peculiarly consoling, that, whilst wars are generally aggravated\r\nby their baneful effects on the internal improvements and permanent\r\nprosperity of the nations engaged in them, such is the favored situation of\r\nthe United States that the calamities of the contest into which they have\r\nbeen compelled to enter are mitigated by improvements and advantages of\r\nwhich the contest itself is the source.\r\n\r\nIf the war has increased the interruptions of our commerce, it has at the\r\nsame time cherished and multiplied our manufactures so as to make us\r\nindependent of all other countries for the more essential branches for\r\nwhich we ought to be dependent on none, and is even rapidly giving them an\r\nextent which will create additional staples in our future intercourse with\r\nforeign markets.\r\n\r\nIf much treasure has been expended, no inconsiderable portion of it has\r\nbeen applied to objects durable in their value and necessary to our\r\npermanent safety.\r\n\r\nIf the war has exposed us to increased spoliations on the ocean and to\r\npredatory incursions on the land, it has developed the national means of\r\nretaliating the former and of providing protection against the latter,\r\ndemonstrating to all that every blow aimed at our maritime independence is\r\nan impulse accelerating the growth of our maritime power.\r\n\r\nBy diffusing through the mass of the nation the elements of military\r\ndiscipline and instruction; by augmenting and distributing warlike\r\npreparations applicable to future use; by evincing the zeal and valor with\r\nwhich they will be employed and the cheerfulness with which every necessary\r\nburden will be borne, a greater respect for our rights and a longer\r\nduration of our future peace are promised than could be expected without\r\nthese proofs of the national character and resources.\r\n\r\nThe war has proved moreover that our free Government, like other free\r\ngovernments, though slow in its early movements, acquires in its progress a\r\nforce proportioned to its freedom, and that the union of these States, the\r\nguardian of the freedom and safety of all and of each, is strengthened by\r\nevery occasion that puts it to the test.\r\n\r\nIn fine, the war, with all its vicissitudes, is illustrating the capacity\r\nand the destiny of the United States to be a great, a flourishing, and a\r\npowerful nation, worthy of the friendship which it is disposed to cultivate\r\nwith all others, and authorized by its own example to require from all an\r\nobservance of the laws of justice and reciprocity. Beyond these their\r\nclaims have never extended, and in contending for these we behold a subject\r\nfor our congratulations in the daily testimonies of increasing harmony\r\nthroughout the nation, and may humbly repose our trust in the smiles of\r\nHeaven on so righteous a cause.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nJames Madison\r\nSeptember 20, 1814\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the early day which had been fixed for your session of the\r\npresent year, I was induced to call you together still sooner, as well that\r\nany inadequacy in the existing provisions for the wants of the Treasury\r\nmight be supplied as that no delay might happen in providing for the result\r\nof the negotiations on foot with Great Britain, whether it should require\r\narrangements adapted to a return of peace or further and more effective\r\nprovisions for prosecuting the war.\r\n\r\nThat result is not yet known. If, on the one hand, the repeal of the orders\r\nin council and the general pacification in Europe, which withdrew the\r\noccasion on which impressments from American vessels were practiced,\r\nsuggest expectations that peace and amity may be reestablished, we are\r\ncompelled, on the other hand, by the refusal of the British Government to\r\naccept the offered mediation of the Emperor of Russia, by the delays in\r\ngiving effect to its own proposal of a direct negotiation, and, above all,\r\nby the principles and manner in which the war is now avowedly carried on to\r\ninfer that a spirit of hostility is indulged more violent than ever against\r\nthe rights and prosperity of this country.\r\n\r\nThis increased violence is best explained by the two important\r\ncircumstances that the great contest in Europe for an equilibrium\r\nguaranteeing all its States against the ambition of any has been closed\r\nwithout any check on the over-bearing power of Great Britain on the ocean,\r\nand it has left in her hands disposable armaments, with which, forgetting\r\nthe difficulties of a remote war with a free people, and yielding to the\r\nintoxication of success, with the example of a great victim to it before\r\nher eyes, she cherishes hopes of still further aggrandizing a power already\r\nformidable in its abuses to the tranquillity of the civilized and\r\ncommercial world.\r\n\r\nBut whatever may have inspired the enemy with these more violent purposes,\r\nthe public councils of a nation more able to maintain than it was to\r\nrequire its independence, and with a devotion to it rendered more ardently\r\nby the experience of its blessings, can never deliberate but on the means\r\nmost effectual for defeating the extravagant views or unwarrantable\r\npassions with which alone the war can now be pursued against us.\r\n\r\nIn the events of the present campaign the enemy, with all his augmented\r\nmeans and wanton use of them, has little ground for exultation, unless he\r\ncan feel it in the success of his recent enterprises against this\r\nmetropolis and the neighboring town of Alexandria, from both of which his\r\nretreats were as precipitate as his attempts were bold and fortunate. In\r\nhis other incursions on our Atlantic frontier his progress, often checked\r\nand chastised by the martial spirit of the neighboring citizens, has had\r\nmore effect in distressing individuals and in dishonoring his arms than in\r\npromoting any object of legitimate warfare; and in the two instances\r\nmentioned, however deeply to be regretted on our part, he will find in his\r\ntransient success, which interrupted for a moment only the ordinary\r\nbusiness at the seat of Government, no compensation for the loss of\r\ncharacter with the world by his violations of private property and by his\r\ndestruction of public edifices protected as monuments of the arts by the\r\nlaws of civilized warfare.\r\n\r\nOn our side we can appeal to a series of achievements which have given new\r\nluster to the American arms. Besides the brilliant incidents in the minor\r\noperations of the campaign, the splendid victories gained on the Canadian\r\nside of the Niagara by the American forces under Major-General Brown and\r\nBrigadiers Scott and Gaines have gained for these heroes and their\r\nemulating companions the most unfading laurels, and, having triumphantly\r\ntested the progressive discipline of the American soldiery, have taught the\r\nenemy that the longer he protracts his hostile efforts the more certain and\r\ndecisive will be his final discomfiture.\r\n\r\nOn our southern border victory has continued also to follow the American\r\nstandard. The bold and skillful operations of Major-General Jackson,\r\nconducting troops drawn from the militia of the States least distant,\r\nparticularly Tennessee, have subdued the principal tribes of hostile\r\nsavages, and, by establishing a peace with them, preceded by recent and\r\nexemplary chastisement, has best guarded against the mischief of their\r\ncooperations with the British enterprises which may be planned against that\r\nquarter of our country. Important tribes of Indians on our northwestern\r\nfrontier have also acceded to stipulations which bind them to the interests\r\nof the United States and to consider our enemy as theirs also.\r\n\r\nIn the recent attempt of the enemy on the city of Baltimore, defended by\r\nmilitia and volunteers, aided by a small body of regulars and sea men, he\r\nwas received with a spirit which produced a rapid retreat to his ships,\r\nwhilst concurrent attack by a large fleet was successfully resisted by the\r\nsteady and well-directed fire of the fort and batteries opposed to it.\r\n\r\nIn another recent attack by a powerful force on our troops at Plattsburg,\r\nof which regulars made a part only, the enemy, after a perseverance for\r\nmany hours, was finally compelled to seek safety in a hasty retreat, with\r\nour gallant bands pressing upon them.\r\n\r\nOn the Lakes, so much contested throughout the war, the great exertions for\r\nthe command made on our part have been well repaid. On Lake Ontario our\r\nsquadron is now and has been for some time in a condition to confine that\r\nof the enemy to his own port, and to favor the operations of our land\r\nforces on that frontier.\r\n\r\nA part of the squadron on Lake Erie has been extended into Lake Huron, and\r\nhas produced the advantage of displaying our command on that lake also. One\r\nobject of the expedition was the reduction of Mackinaw, which followed with\r\nthe loss of a few brave men, among whom was an officer justly distinguished\r\nfor his gallant exploits. The expedition, ably conducted by both the land\r\nand the naval commanders, was otherwise highly valuable in its effects.\r\n\r\nOn Lake Champlain, where our superiority had for some time been undisputed,\r\nthe British squadron lately came into action with the American, commanded\r\nby Captain Macdonough. It issued in the capture of the whole of the enemy's\r\nships. The best praise for this officer and his intrepid comrades is in the\r\nlikeness of his triumph to the illustrious victory which immortalized\r\nanother officer and established at a critical moment our command of another\r\nlake.\r\n\r\nOn the ocean the pride of our naval arms had been amply supported. A second\r\nfrigate has indeed fallen into the hands of the enemy, but the loss is\r\nhidden in the blaze of heroism with which she was defended. Captain Porter,\r\nwho commanded her, and whose previous career had been distinguished by\r\ndaring enterprise and by fertility of genius, maintained a sanguinary\r\ncontest against two ships, one of them superior to his own, and under other\r\nsevere disadvantages, 'til humanity tore down the colors which valor had\r\nnailed to the mast. This officer and his brave comrades have added much to\r\nthe rising glory of the American flag, and have merited all the effusions\r\nof gratitude which their country is ever ready to bestow on the champions\r\nof its rights and of its safety.\r\n\r\nTwo smaller vessels of war have also become prizes to the enemy, but by a\r\nsuperiority of force which sufficiently vindicates the reputation of their\r\ncommanders, whilst two others, one commanded by Captain Warrington, the\r\nother by Captain Blakely, have captured British ships of the same class\r\nwith a gallantry and good conduct which entitle them and their companions\r\nto a just share in the praise of their country.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the naval force of the enemy accumulated on our coasts, our\r\nprivate cruisers also have not ceased to annoy his commerce and to bring\r\ntheir rich prizes into our ports, contributing thus, with other proofs, to\r\ndemonstrate the incompetency and illegality of a blockade the proclamation\r\nof which is made the pretext for vexing and discouraging the commerce of\r\nneutral powers with the United States.\r\n\r\nTo meet the extended and diversified warfare adopted by the enemy, great\r\nbodies of militia have been taken into service for the public defense, and\r\ngreat expenses incurred. That the defense everywhere may be both more\r\nconvenient and more economical, Congress will see the necessity of\r\nimmediate measures for filling the ranks of the Regular Army and of\r\nenlarging the provision for special corps, mounted and unmounted, to be\r\nengaged for longer periods of service than are due from the militia. I\r\nearnestly renew, at the same time, a recommendation of such changes in the\r\nsystem of the militia as, by classing and disciplining for the most prompt\r\nand active service the portions most capable of it, will give to that great\r\nresource for the public safety all the requisite energy and efficiency.\r\n\r\nThe moneys received into the Treasury during the nine months ending on the\r\n30th day of June last amounted to $32 millions, of which near $11 millions\r\nwere the proceeds of the public revenue and the remainder derived from\r\nloans. The disbursements for public expenditures during the same period\r\nexceeded $34 millions, and left in the Treasury on the first day of July\r\nnear $5 millions. The demands during the remainder of the present year\r\nalready authorized by Congress and the expenses incident to an extension\r\nof the operations of the war will render it necessary that large sums\r\nshould be provided to meet them.\r\n\r\nFrom this view of the national affairs Congress will be urged to take up\r\nwithout delay as well the subject of pecuniary supplies as that of military\r\nforce, and on a scale commensurate with the extent and the character which\r\nthe war has assumed. It is not to be disguised that the situation of our\r\ncountry calls for its greatest efforts.\r\n\r\nOur enemy is powerful in men and in money, on the land and on the water.\r\nAvailing himself of fortuitous advantages, he is aiming with his undivided\r\nforce a deadly blow at our growing prosperity, perhaps at our national\r\nexistence. He has avowed his purpose of trampling on the usages of\r\ncivilized warfare, and given earnests of it in the plunder and wanton\r\ndestruction of private property. In his pride of maritime dominion and in\r\nhis thirst of commercial monopoly he strikes with peculiar animosity at the\r\nprogress of our navigation and of our manufactures. His barbarous policy\r\nhas not even spared those monuments of the arts and models of taste with\r\nwhich our country had enriched and embellished its infant metropolis. From\r\nsuch an adversary hostility in its greatest force and in its worst forms\r\nmay be looked for.\r\n\r\nThe American people will face it with the undaunted spirit which in their\r\nrevolutionary struggle defeated his unrighteous projects. His threats and\r\nhis barbarities, instead of dismay, will kindle in every bosom an\r\nindignation not to be extinguished but in the disaster and expulsion of\r\nsuch cruel invaders.\r\n\r\nIn providing the means necessary the National Legislature will not distrust\r\nthe heroic and enlightened patriotism of its constituents. They will\r\ncheerfully and proudly bear every burden of every kind which the safety and\r\nhonor of the nation demand. We have seen them everywhere paying their\r\ntaxes, direct and indirect, with the greatest promptness and alacrity. We\r\nsee them rushing with enthusiasm to the scenes where danger and duty call.\r\nIn offering their blood they give the surest pledge that no other tribute\r\nwill be withheld.\r\n\r\nHaving forborne to declare war until to other aggressions had been added\r\nthe capture of near one thousand American vessels and the impressment of\r\nthousands of American sea faring citizens, and until a final declaration\r\nhad been made by the Government of Great Britain that her hostile orders\r\nagainst our commerce would not be revoked but on conditions as impossible\r\nas unjust, whilst it was known that these orders would not otherwise\r\ncease but with a war which had lasted nearly twenty years, and which,\r\naccording to appearances at that time, might last as many more; having\r\nmanifested on every occasion and in every proper mode a sincere desire to\r\narrest the effusion of blood and meet our enemy on the ground of justice\r\nand reconciliation, our beloved country, in still opposing to his\r\npersevering hostility all its energies, with an undiminished disposition\r\ntoward peace and friendship on honorable terms, must carry with it the\r\ngood wishes of the impartial world and the best hopes of support from an\r\nomnipotent and kind Providence.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nJames Madison\r\nDecember 5, 1815\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nI have the satisfaction on our present meeting of being able to communicate\r\nthe successful termination of the war which had been commenced against the\r\nUnited States by the Regency of Algiers. The squadron in advance on that\r\nservice, under Commodore Decatur, lost not a moment after its arrival in\r\nthe Mediterranean in seeking the naval force of the enemy then cruising in\r\nthat sea, and succeeded in capturing two of his ships, one of them the\r\nprincipal ship, commanded by the Algerine admiral. The high character of\r\nthe American commander was brilliantly sustained on the occasion which\r\nbrought his own ship into close action with that of his adversary, as was\r\nthe accustomed gallantry of all the officers and men actually engaged.\r\nHaving prepared the way by this demonstration of American skill and\r\nprowess, he hastened to the port of Algiers, where peace was promptly\r\nyielded to his victorious force.\r\n\r\nIn the terms stipulated the rights and honor of the United States were\r\nparticularly consulted by a perpetual relinquishment on the part of the Dey\r\nof all pretensions to tribute from them. The impressions which have thus\r\nbeen made, strengthened as they will have been by subsequent transactions\r\nwith the Regencies of Tunis and of Tripoli by the appearance of the larger\r\nforce which followed under Commodore Bainbridge, the chief in command of\r\nthe expedition, and by the judicious precautionary arrangements left by him\r\nin that quarter, afford a reasonable prospect of future security for the\r\nvaluable portion of our commerce which passes within reach of the Barbary\r\ncruisers.\r\n\r\nIt is another source of satisfaction that the treaty of peace with Great\r\nBritain has been succeeded by a convention on the subject of commerce\r\nconcluded by the plenipotentiaries of the two countries. In this result a\r\ndisposition is manifested on the part of that nation corresponding with the\r\ndisposition of the United States, which it may be hoped will be improved\r\ninto liberal arrangements on other subjects on which the parties have\r\nmutual interests, or which might endanger their future harmony. Congress\r\nwill decide on the expediency of promoting such a sequel by giving effect\r\nto the measure of confining the American navigation to American sea men--a\r\nmeasure which, at the same time that it might have that conciliatory\r\ntendency, would have the further advantage of increasing the independence\r\nof our navigation and the resources for our maritime defense.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with the articles in the treaty of Ghent relating to the\r\nIndians, as well as with a view to the tranquillity of our western and\r\nnorthwestern frontiers, measures were taken to establish an immediate peace\r\nwith the several tribes who had been engaged in hostilities against the\r\nUnited States. Such of them as were invited to Detroit acceded readily to a\r\nrenewal of the former treaties of friendship. Of the other tribes who were\r\ninvited to a station on the Mississippi the greater number have also\r\naccepted the peace offered to them. The residue, consisting of the more\r\ndistant tribes or parts of tribes, remain to be brought over by further\r\nexplanations, or by such other means as may be adapted to the dispositions\r\nthey may finally disclose.\r\n\r\nThe Indian tribes within and bordering on the southern frontier, whom a\r\ncruel war on their part had compelled us to chastise into peace, have\r\nlatterly shown a restlessness which has called for preparatory measures for\r\nrepressing it, and for protecting the commissioners engaged in carrying the\r\nterms of the peace into execution.\r\n\r\nThe execution of the act for fixing the military peace establishment has\r\nbeen attended with difficulties which even now can only be overcome by\r\nlegislative aid. The selection of officers, the payment and discharge of\r\nthe troops enlisted for the war, the payment of the retained troops and\r\ntheir reunion from detached and distant stations, the collection and\r\nsecurity of the public property in the Quartermaster, Commissary, and\r\nOrdnance departments, and the constant medical assistance required in\r\nhospitals and garrisons rendered a complete execution of the act\r\nimpracticable on the 1st of May, the period more immediately contemplated.\r\nAs soon, however, as circumstances would permit, and as far as it has been\r\npracticable consistently with the public interests, the reduction of the\r\nArmy has been accomplished; but the appropriations for its pay and for\r\nother branches of the military service having proved inadequate, the\r\nearliest attention to that subject will be necessary; and the expediency of\r\ncontinuing upon the peace establishment the staff officers who have\r\nhitherto been provisionally retained is also recommended to the\r\nconsideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nIn the performance of the Executive duty upon this occasion there has not\r\nbeen wanting a just sensibility to the merits of the American Army during\r\nthe late war; but the obvious policy and design in fixing an efficient\r\nmilitary peace establishment did not afford an opportunity to distinguish\r\nthe aged and infirm on account of their past services nor the wounded and\r\ndisabled on account of their present sufferings.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the reduction, indeed, unavoidably involved the exclusion of\r\nmany meritorious officers of every rank from the service of their country;\r\nand so equal as well as so numerous were the claims to attention that a\r\ndecision by the standard of comparative merit could seldom be attained.\r\nJudged, however, in candor by a general standard of positive merit, the\r\nArmy Register will, it is believed, do honor to the establishment, while\r\nthe case of those officers whose names are not included in it devolves with\r\nthe strongest interest upon the legislative authority for such provisions\r\nas shall be deemed the best calculated to give support and solace to the\r\nveteran and the invalid, to display the beneficence as well as the justice\r\nof the Government, and to inspire a martial zeal for the public service\r\nupon every future emergency.\r\n\r\nAlthough the embarrassments arising from the want of an uniform national\r\ncurrency have not been diminished since the adjournment of Congress, great\r\nsatisfaction has been derived in contemplating the revival of the public\r\ncredit and the efficiency of the public resources. The receipts into the\r\nTreasury from the various branches of revenue during the nine months ending\r\non the 30th of September last have been estimated at $12.5 millions; the\r\nissues of Treasury notes of every denomination during the same period\r\namounted to the sum of $14 millions, and there was also obtained upon loan\r\nduring the same period a sum of $9 millions, of which the sum of $6\r\nmillions was subscribed in cash and the sum of $3 millions in Treasury\r\nnotes.\r\n\r\nWith these means, added to the sum of $1.5 millions, being the balance of\r\nmoney in the Treasury on the 1st day of January, there has been paid\r\nbetween the 1st of January and the 1st of October on account of the\r\nappropriations of the preceding and of the present year (exclusively of\r\nthe amount of the Treasury notes subscribed to the loan and of the amount\r\nredeemed in the payment of duties and taxes) the aggregate sum of $33.5\r\nmillions, leaving a balance then in the Treasury estimated at the sum of\r\n$3 millions. Independent, however of the arrearages due for military\r\nservices and supplies, it is presumed that a further sum of $5 millions,\r\nincluding the interest on the public debt payable on the 1st of January\r\nnext, will be demanded at the Treasury to complete the expenditures of\r\nthe present year, and for which the existing ways and means will\r\nsufficiently provide.\r\n\r\nThe national debt, as it was ascertained on the 1st of October last,\r\namounted in the whole to the sum of $120 millions, consisting of the\r\nunredeemed balance of the debt contracted before the late war ($39\r\nmillions), the amount of the funded debt contracted in consequence of the\r\nwar ($64 millions), and the amount of the unfunded and floating debt,\r\nincluding the various issues of Treasury notes, $17 millions, which is in\r\ngradual course of payment.\r\n\r\nThere will probably be some addition to the public debt upon the\r\nliquidation of various claims which are depending, and a conciliatory\r\ndisposition on the part of Congress may lead honorably and advantageously\r\nto an equitable arrangement of the militia expenses incurred by the several\r\nStates without the previous sanction or authority of the Government of the\r\nUnited States; but when it is considered that the new as well as the old\r\nportion of the debt has been contracted in the assertion of the national\r\nrights and independence, and when it is recollected that the public\r\nexpenditures, not being exclusively bestowed upon subjects of a transient\r\nnature, will long be visible in the number and equipments of the American\r\nNavy, in the military works for the defense of our harbors and our\r\nfrontiers, and in the supplies of our arsenals and magazines the amount\r\nwill bear a gratifying comparison with the objects which have been\r\nattained, as well as with the resources of the country.\r\n\r\nThe arrangements of the finances with a view to the receipts and\r\nexpenditures of a permanent peace establishment will necessarily enter into\r\nthe deliberations of Congress during the present session. It is true that\r\nthe improved condition of the public revenue will not only afford the means\r\nof maintaining the faith of the Government with its creditors inviolate,\r\nand of prosecuting successfully the measures of the most liberal policy,\r\nbut will also justify an immediate alleviation of the burdens imposed by\r\nthe necessities of the war.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, essential to every modification of the finances that the\r\nbenefits of an uniform national currency should be restored to the\r\ncommunity. The absence of the precious metals will, it is believed, be a\r\ntemporary evil, but until they can again be rendered the general medium of\r\nexchange it devolves on the wisdom of Congress to provide a substitute\r\nwhich shall equally engage the confidence and accommodate the wants of the\r\ncitizens throughout the Union. If the operation of the State banks can not\r\nproduce this result, the probable operation of a national bank will merit\r\nconsideration; and if neither of these expedients be deemed effectual it\r\nmay become necessary to ascertain the terms upon which the notes of the\r\nGovernment (no longer required as an instrument of credit) shall be issued\r\nupon motives of general policy as a common medium of circulation.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the security for future repose which the United States\r\nought to find in their love of peace and their constant respect for the\r\nrights of other nations, the character of the times particularly inculcates\r\nthe lesson that, whether to prevent or repel danger, we ought not to be\r\nunprepared for it. This consideration will sufficiently recommend to\r\nCongress a liberal provision for the immediate extension and gradual\r\ncompletion of the works of defense, both fixed and floating, on our\r\nmaritime frontier, and an adequate provision for guarding our inland\r\nfrontier against dangers to which certain portions of it may continue to be\r\nexposed.\r\n\r\nAs an improvement in our military establishment, it will deserve the\r\nconsideration of Congress whether a corps of invalids might not be so\r\norganized and employed as at once to aid in the support of meritorious\r\nindividuals excluded by age or infirmities from the existing establishment,\r\nand to procure to the public the benefit of their stationary services and\r\nof their exemplary discipline.\r\n\r\nI recommend also an enlargement of the Military Academy already\r\nestablished, and the establishment of others in other sections of the\r\nUnion; and I can not press too much on the attention of Congress such a\r\nclassification and organization of the militia as will most effectually\r\nrender it the safeguard of a free state. If experience has shewn in the\r\nrecent splendid achievements of militia the value of this resource for the\r\npublic defense, it has shewn also the importance of that skill in the use\r\nof arms and that familiarity with the essential rules of discipline which\r\ncan not be expected from the regulations now in force.\r\n\r\nWith this subject is intimately connected the necessity of accommodating\r\nthe laws in every respect to the great object of enabling the political\r\nauthority of the Union to employ promptly and effectually the physical\r\npower of the Union in the cases designated by the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe signal services which have been rendered by our Navy and the capacities\r\nit has developed for successful cooperation in the national defense will\r\ngive to that portion of the public force its full value in the eyes of\r\nCongress, at an epoch which calls for the constant vigilance of all\r\ngovernments. To preserve the ships now in a sound state, to complete those\r\nalready contemplated, to provide amply the imperishable materials for\r\nprompt augmentations, and to improve the existing arrangements into more\r\nadvantageous establishments for the construction, the repairs, and the\r\nsecurity of vessels of war is dictated by the soundest policy.\r\n\r\nIn adjusting the duties on imports to the object of revenue the influence\r\nof the tariff on manufactures will necessarily present itself for\r\nconsideration. However wise the theory may be which leaves to the sagacity\r\nand interest of individuals the application of their industry and\r\nresources, there are in this as in other cases exceptions to the general\r\nrule. Besides the condition which the theory itself implies of reciprocal\r\nadoption by other nations, experience teaches that so many circumstances\r\nmust concur in introducing and maturing manufacturing establishments,\r\nespecially of the more complicated kinds, that a country may remain long\r\nwithout them, although sufficiently advanced and in some respects even\r\npeculiarly fitted for carrying them on with success. Under circumstances\r\ngiving a powerful impulse to manufacturing industry it has made among us a\r\nprogress and exhibited an efficiency which justify the belief that with a\r\nprotection not more than is due to the enterprising citizens whose\r\ninterests are now at stake it will become at an early day not only safe\r\nagainst occasional competitions from abroad, but a source of domestic\r\nwealth and even of external commerce.\r\n\r\nIn selecting the branches more especially entitled to the public patronage\r\na preference is obviously claimed by such as will relieve the United States\r\nfrom a dependence on foreign supplies, ever subject to casual failures, for\r\narticles necessary for the public defense or connected with the primary\r\nwants of individuals. It will be an additional recommendation of particular\r\nmanufactures where the materials for them are extensively drawn from our\r\nagriculture, and consequently impart and insure to that great fund of\r\nnational prosperity and independence an encouragement which can not fail to\r\nbe rewarded.\r\n\r\nAmong the means of advancing the public interest the occasion is a proper\r\none for recalling the attention of Congress to the great importance of\r\nestablishing throughout our country the roads and canals which can best be\r\nexecuted under the national authority. No objects within the circle of\r\npolitical economy so richly repay the expense bestowed on them; there are\r\nnone the utility of which is more universally ascertained and acknowledged;\r\nnone that do more honor to the governments whose wise and enlarged\r\npatriotism duly appreciates them. Nor is there any country which presents a\r\nfield where nature invites more the art of man to complete her own work for\r\nhis accommodation and benefit.\r\n\r\nThese considerations are strengthened, moreover, by the political effect of\r\nthese facilities for intercommunication in bringing and binding more\r\nclosely together the various parts of our extended confederacy. Whilst the\r\nStates individually, with a laudable enterprise and emulation, avail\r\nthemselves of their local advantages by new roads, by navigable canals, and\r\nby improving the streams susceptible of navigation, the General Government\r\nis the more urged to similar undertakings, requiring a national\r\njurisdiction and national means, by the prospect of thus systematically\r\ncompleting so inestimable a work; and it is a happy reflection that any\r\ndefect of constitutional authority which may be encountered can be supplied\r\nin a mode which the Constitution itself has providently pointed out.\r\n\r\nThe present is a favorable season also for bringing again into view the\r\nestablishment of a national seminary of learning within the District of\r\nColumbia, and with means drawn from the property therein, subject to the\r\nauthority of the General Government. Such an institution claims the\r\npatronage of Congress as a monument of their solicitude for the advancement\r\nof knowledge, without which the blessings of liberty can not be fully\r\nenjoyed or long preserved; as a model instructive in the formation of other\r\nseminaries; as a nursery of enlightened preceptors, and as a central resort\r\nof youth and genius from every part of their country, diffusing on their\r\nreturn examples of those national feelings, those liberal sentiments, and\r\nthose congenial manners which contribute cement to our Union and strength\r\nto the great political fabric of which that is the foundation.\r\n\r\nIn closing this communication I ought not to repress a sensibility, in\r\nwhich you will unite, to the happy lot of our country and to the goodness\r\nof a superintending Providence, to which we are indebted for it. Whilst\r\nother portions of mankind are laboring under the distresses of war or\r\nstruggling with adversity in other forms, the United States are in the\r\ntranquil enjoyment of prosperous and honorable peace. In reviewing the\r\nscenes through which it has been attained we can rejoice in the proofs\r\ngiven that our political institutions, founded in human rights and framed\r\nfor their preservation, are equal to the severest trials of war, as well\r\nadapted to the ordinary periods of repose.\r\n\r\nAs fruits of this experience and of the reputation acquired by the American\r\narms on the land and on the water, the nation finds itself possessed of a\r\ngrowing respect abroad and of a just confidence in itself, which are among\r\nthe best pledges for its peaceful career. Under other aspects of our\r\ncountry the strongest features of its flourishing condition are seen in a\r\npopulation rapidly increasing on a territory as productive as it is\r\nextensive; in a general industry and fertile ingenuity which find their\r\nample rewards, and in an affluent revenue which admits a reduction of the\r\npublic burdens without withdrawing the means of sustaining the public\r\ncredit, of gradually discharging the public debt, of providing for the\r\nnecessary defensive and precautionary establishments, and of patronizing in\r\nevery authorized mode undertakings conducive to the aggregate wealth and\r\nindividual comfort of our citizens.\r\n\r\nIt remains for the guardians of the public welfare to persevere in that\r\njustice and good will toward other nations which invite a return of these\r\nsentiments toward the United States; to cherish institutions which\r\nguarantee their safety and their liberties, civil and religious; and to\r\ncombine with a liberal system of foreign commerce an improvement of the\r\nnational advantages and a protection and extension of the independent\r\nresources of our highly favored and happy country.\r\n\r\nIn all measures having such objects my faithful cooperation will be\r\nafforded.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nJames Madison\r\nDecember 3, 1816\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the present state of our country, our attention cannot be\r\nwithheld from the effect produced by peculiar seasons which have very\r\ngenerally impaired the annual gifts of the earth and threatened scarcity in\r\nparticular districts. Such, however, is the variety of soils, of climates,\r\nand of products within our extensive limits that the aggregate resources\r\nfor subsistence are more than sufficient for the aggregate wants. And as\r\nfar as an economy of consumption, more than usual, may be necessary, our\r\nthankfulness is due to Providence for what is far more than a compensation,\r\nin the remarkable health which has distinguished the present year.\r\n\r\nAmidst the advantages which have succeeded the peace of Europe, and that of\r\nthe United States with Great Britain, in a general invigoration of industry\r\namong us and in the extension of our commerce, the value of which is more\r\nand more disclosing itself to commercial nations, it is to be regretted\r\nthat a depression is experienced by particular branches of our manufactures\r\nand by a portion of our navigation. As the first proceeds in an essential\r\ndegree from an excess of imported merchandise, which carries a check in its\r\nown tendency, the cause in its present extent can not be very long in\r\nduration. The evil will not, however, be viewed by Congress without a\r\nrecollection that manufacturing establishments, if suffered to sink too low\r\nor languish too long, may not revive after the causes shall have ceased,\r\nand that in the vicissitudes of human affairs situations may recur in which\r\na dependence on foreign sources for indispensable supplies may be among the\r\nmost serious embarrassments.\r\n\r\nThe depressed state of our navigation is to be ascribed in a material\r\ndegree to its exclusion from the colonial ports of the nation most\r\nextensively connected with us in commerce, and from the indirect operation\r\nof that exclusion.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the late convention at London between the United States and\r\nGreat Britain the relative state of the navigation laws of the two\r\ncountries, growing out of the treaty of 1794, had given to the British\r\nnavigation a material advantage over the American in the intercourse\r\nbetween the American ports and British ports in Europe. The convention of\r\nLondon equalized the laws of the two countries relating to those ports,\r\nleaving the intercourse between our ports and the ports of the British\r\ncolonies subject, as before, to the respective regulations of the parties.\r\nThe British Government enforcing now regulations which prohibit a trade\r\nbetween its colonies and the United States in American vessels, whilst they\r\npermit a trade in British vessels, the American navigation loses\r\naccordingly, and the loss is augmented by the advantage which is given to\r\nthe British competition over the American in the navigation between our\r\nports and British ports in Europe by the circuitous voyages enjoyed by the\r\none and not enjoyed by the other.\r\n\r\nThe reasonableness of the rule of reciprocity applied to one branch of the\r\ncommercial intercourse has been pressed on our part as equally applicable\r\nto both branches; but it is ascertained that the British cabinet declines\r\nall negotiation on the subject, with a disavowal, however, of any\r\ndisposition to view in an unfriendly light whatever countervailing\r\nregulations the United States may oppose to the regulations of which they\r\ncomplain. The wisdom of the Legislature will decide on the course which,\r\nunder these circumstances, is prescribed by a joint regard to the amicable\r\nrelations between the two nations and to the just interests of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nI have the satisfaction to state, generally, that we remain in amity with\r\nforeign powers.\r\n\r\nAn occurrence has indeed taken place in the Gulf of Mexico which, if\r\nsanctioned by the Spanish Government, may make an exception as to that\r\npower. According to the report of our naval commander on that station, one\r\nof our public armed vessels was attacked by an over-powering force under a\r\nSpanish commander, and the American flag, with the officers and crew,\r\ninsulted in a manner calling for prompt reparation. This has been demanded.\r\nIn the mean time a frigate and a smaller vessel of war have been ordered\r\ninto that Gulf for the protection of our commerce. It would be improper to\r\nomit that the representative of His Catholic Majesty in the United States\r\nlost no time in giving the strongest assurances that no hostile order could\r\nhave emanated from his Government, and that it will be as ready to do as to\r\nexpect whatever the nature of the case and the friendly relations of the\r\ntwo countries shall be found to require.\r\n\r\nThe posture of our affairs with Algiers at the present moment is not known.\r\nThe Dey, drawing pretexts from circumstances for which the United States\r\nwere not answerable, addressed a letter to this Government declaring the\r\ntreaty last concluded with him to have been annulled by our violation of\r\nit, and presenting as the alternative war or a renewal of the former\r\ntreaty, which stipulated, among other things, an annual tribute. The\r\nanswer, with an explicit declaration that the United States preferred war\r\nto tribute, required his recognition and observance of the treaty last\r\nmade, which abolishes tribute and the slavery of our captured citizens. The\r\nresult of the answer has not been received. Should he renew his warfare on\r\nour commerce, we rely on the protection it will find in our naval force\r\nactually in the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nWith the other Barbary States our affairs have undergone no change.\r\n\r\nThe Indian tribes within our limits appear also disposed to remain at\r\npeace. From several of them purchases of lands have been made particularly\r\nfavorable to the wishes and security of our frontier settlements, as well\r\nas to the general interests of the nation. In some instances the titles,\r\nthough not supported by due proof, and clashing those of one tribe with the\r\nclaims of another, have been extinguished by double purchases, the\r\nbenevolent policy of the United States preferring the augmented expense to\r\nthe hazard of doing injustice or to the enforcement of justice against a\r\nfeeble and untutored people by means involving or threatening an effusion\r\nof blood.\r\n\r\nI am happy to add that the tranquillity which has been restored among the\r\ntribes themselves, as well as between them and our own population, will\r\nfavor the resumption of the work of civilization which had made an\r\nencouraging progress among some tribes, and that the facility is increasing\r\nfor extending that divided and individual ownership, which exists now in\r\nmovable property only, to the soil itself, and of thus establishing in the\r\nculture and improvement of it the true foundation for a transit from the\r\nhabits of the savage to the arts and comforts of social life.\r\n\r\nAs a subject of the highest importance to the national welfare, I must\r\nagain earnestly recommend to the consideration of Congress a reorganization\r\nof the militia on a plan which will form it into classes according to the\r\nperiods of life more or less adapted to military services. An efficient\r\nmilitia is authorized and contemplated by the Constitution and required by\r\nthe spirit and safety of free government. The present organization of our\r\nmilitia is universally regarded as less efficient than it ought to be made,\r\nand no organization can be better calculated to give to it its due force\r\nthan a classification which will assign the foremost place in the defense\r\nof the country to that portion of its citizens whose activity and animation\r\nbest enable them to rally to its standard. Besides the consideration that a\r\ntime of peace is the time when the change can be made with most convenience\r\nand equity, it will now be aided by the experience of a recent war in which\r\nthe militia bore so interesting a part.\r\n\r\nCongress will call to mind that no adequate provision has yet been made for\r\nthe uniformity of weights and measures also contemplated by the\r\nConstitution. The great utility of a standard fixed in its nature and\r\nfounded on the easy rule of decimal proportions is sufficiently obvious. It\r\nled the Government at an early stage to preparatory steps for introducing\r\nit, and a completion of the work will be a just title to the public\r\ngratitude.\r\n\r\nThe importance which I have attached to the establishment of a university\r\nwithin this District on a scale and for objects worthy of the American\r\nnation induces me to renew my recommendation of it to the favorable\r\nconsideration of Congress. And I particularly invite again their attention\r\nto the expediency of exercising their existing powers, and, where\r\nnecessary, of resorting to the prescribed mode of enlarging them, in order\r\nto effectuate a comprehensive system of roads and canals, such as will have\r\nthe effect of drawing more closely together every part of our country by\r\npromoting intercourse and improvements and by increasing the share of every\r\npart in the common stock of national prosperity.\r\n\r\nOccurrences having taken place which shew that the statutory provisions for\r\nthe dispensation of criminal justice are deficient in relation both to\r\nplaces and to persons under the exclusive cognizance of the national\r\nauthority, an amendment of the law embracing such cases will merit the\r\nearliest attention of the Legislature. It will be a seasonable occasion\r\nalso for inquiring how far legislative interposition may be further\r\nrequisite in providing penalties for offenses designated in the\r\nConstitution or in the statutes, and to which either no penalties are\r\nannexed or none with sufficient certainty. And I submit to the wisdom of\r\nCongress whether a more enlarged revisal of the criminal code be not\r\nexpedient for the purpose of mitigating in certain cases penalties which\r\nwere adopted into it antecedent to experiment and examples which justify\r\nand recommend a more lenient policy.\r\n\r\nThe United States, having been the first to abolish within the extent of\r\ntheir authority the transportation of the natives of Africa into slavery,\r\nby prohibiting the introduction of slaves and by punishing their citizens\r\nparticipating in the traffic, can not but be gratified at the progress made\r\nby concurrent efforts of other nations toward a general suppression of so\r\ngreat an evil. They must feel at the same time the greater solicitude to\r\ngive the fullest efficacy to their own regulations. With that view, the\r\ninterposition of Congress appears to be required by the violations and\r\nevasions which it is suggested are chargeable on unworthy citizens who\r\nmingle in the slave trade under foreign flags and with foreign ports, and\r\nby collusive importations of slaves into the United States through\r\nadjoining ports and territories. I present the subject to Congress with a\r\nfull assurance of their disposition to apply all the remedy which can be\r\nafforded by an amendment of the law. The regulations which were intended to\r\nguard against abuses of a kindred character in the trade between the\r\nseveral States ought also to be rendered more effectual for their humane\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nTo these recommendations I add, for the consideration of Congress, the\r\nexpediency of a remodification of the judiciary establishment, and of an\r\nadditional department in the executive branch of the Government.\r\n\r\nThe first is called for by the accruing business which necessarily swells\r\nthe duties of the Federal courts, and by the great and widening space\r\nwithin which justice is to be dispensed by them. The time seems to have\r\narrived which claims for members of the Supreme Court a relief from\r\nitinerary fatigues, incompatible as well with the age which a portion of\r\nthem will always have attained as with the researches and preparations\r\nwhich are due to their stations and to the juridical reputation of their\r\ncountry. And considerations equally cogent require a more convenient\r\norganization of the subordinate tribunals, which may be accomplished\r\nwithout an objectionable increase of the number or expense of the judges.\r\n\r\nThe extent and variety of executive business also accumulating with the\r\nprogress of our country and its growing population call for an additional\r\ndepartment, to be charged with duties now over-burdening other departments\r\nand with such as have not been annexed to any department.\r\n\r\nThe course of experience recommends, as another improvement in the\r\nexecutive establishment, that the provision for the station of\r\nAttorney-General, whose residence at the seat of Government, official\r\nconnections with it, and the management of the public business before the\r\njudiciary preclude an extensive participation in professional emoluments,\r\nbe made more adequate to his services and his relinquishments, and that,\r\nwith a view to his reasonable accommodation and to a proper depository of\r\nhis official opinions and proceedings, there be included in the provision\r\nthe usual appurtenances to a public office.\r\n\r\nIn directing the legislative attention to the state of the finances it is a\r\nsubject of great gratification to find that even within the short period\r\nwhich has elapsed since the return of peace the revenue has far exceeded\r\nall the current demands upon the Treasury, and that under any probable\r\ndiminution of its future annual products which the vicissitudes of commerce\r\nmay occasion it will afford an ample fund for the effectual and early\r\nextinguishment of the public debt. It has been estimated that during the\r\nyear 1816 the actual receipts of revenue at the Treasury, including the\r\nbalance at the commencement of the year, and excluding the proceeds of\r\nloans and Treasury notes, will amount to about the sum of $47 millions;\r\nthat during the same year the actual payments at the Treasury, including\r\nthe payment of the arrearages of the War Department as well as the payment\r\nof a considerable excess beyond the annual appropriations, will amount to\r\nabout the sum of $38 millions, and that consequently at the close of the\r\nyear there will be a surplus in the Treasury of about the sum of $9\r\nmillions.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the Treasury continued to be obstructed by difficulties\r\narising from the condition of the national currency, but they have\r\nnevertheless been effectual to a beneficial extent in the reduction of the\r\npublic debt and the establishment of the public credit. The floating debt\r\nof Treasury notes and temporary loans will soon be entirely discharged. The\r\naggregate of the funded debt, composed of debts incurred during the wars of\r\n1776 and 1812, has been estimated with reference to the first of January\r\nnext at a sum not exceeding $110 millions. The ordinary annual expenses of\r\nthe Government for the maintenance of all its institutions, civil,\r\nmilitary, and naval, have been estimated at a sum greater than $20\r\nmillions, and the permanent revenue to be derived from all the existing\r\nsources has been estimated at a sum of $25 millions.\r\n\r\nUpon this general view of the subject it is obvious that there is only\r\nwanting to the fiscal prosperity of the Government the restoration of an\r\nuniform medium of exchange. The resources and the faith of the nation,\r\ndisplayed in the system which Congress has established, insure respect and\r\nconfidence both at home and abroad. The local accumulations of the revenue\r\nhave already enabled the Treasury to meet the public engagements in the\r\nlocal currency of most of the States, and it is expected that the same\r\ncause will produce the same effect throughout the Union; but for the\r\ninterests of the community at large, as well as for the purposes of the\r\nTreasury, it is essential that the nation should possess a currency of\r\nequal value, credit, and use wherever it may circulate. The Constitution\r\nhas intrusted Congress exclusively with the power of creating and\r\nregulating a currency of that description, and the measures which were\r\ntaken during the last session in execution of the power give every promise\r\nof success. The Bank of the United States has been organized under auspices\r\nthe most favorable, and can not fail to be an important auxiliary to those\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\nFor a more enlarged view of the public finances, with a view of the\r\nmeasures pursued by the Treasury Department previous to the resignation of\r\nthe late Secretary, I transmit an extract from the last report of that\r\nofficer. Congress will perceive in it ample proofs of the solid foundation\r\non which the financial prosperity of the nation rests, and will do justice\r\nto the distinguished ability and successful exertions with which the duties\r\nof the Department were executed during a period remarkable for its\r\ndifficulties and its peculiar perplexities.\r\n\r\nThe period of my retiring from the public service being at little distance,\r\nI shall find no occasion more proper than the present for expressing to my\r\nfellow citizens my deep sense of the continued confidence and kind support\r\nwhich I have received from them. My grateful recollection of these\r\ndistinguished marks of their favorable regard can never cease, and with the\r\nconsciousness that, if I have not served my country with greater ability, I\r\nhave served it with a sincere devotion will accompany me as a source of\r\nunfailing gratification.\r\n\r\nHappily, I shall carry with me from the public theater other sources, which\r\nthose who love their country most will best appreciate. I shall behold it\r\nblessed with tranquillity and prosperity at home and with peace and respect\r\nabroad. I can indulge the proud reflection that the American people have\r\nreached in safety and success their 40th year as an independent nation;\r\nthat for nearly an entire generation they have had experience of their\r\npresent Constitution, the off-spring of their undisturbed deliberations and\r\nof their free choice; that they have found it to bear the trials of adverse\r\nas well as prosperous circumstances; to contain in its combination of the\r\nfederate and elective principles a reconcilement of public strength with\r\nindividual liberty, of national power for the defense of national rights\r\nwith a security against wars of injustice, of ambition, and vain-glory in\r\nthe fundamental provision which subjects all questions of war to the will\r\nof the nation itself, which is to pay its costs and feel its calamities.\r\nNor is it less a peculiar felicity of this Constitution, so dear to us all,\r\nthat it is found to be capable, without losing its vital energies, of\r\nexpanding itself over a spacious territory with the increase and expansion\r\nof the community for whose benefit it was established.\r\n\r\nAnd may I not be allowed to add to this gratifying spectacle that I shall\r\nread in the character of the American people, in their devotion to true\r\nliberty and to the Constitution which is its palladium, sure presages that\r\nthe destined career of my country will exhibit a Government pursuing the\r\npublic good as its sole object, and regulating its means by the great\r\nprinciples consecrated in its charter and by those moral principles to\r\nwhich they are so well allied; a Government which watches over the purity\r\nof elections, the freedom of speech and of the press, the trial by jury,\r\nand the equal interdict against encroachments and compacts between religion\r\nand the state; which maintains inviolably the maxims of public faith, the\r\nsecurity of persons and property, and encourages in every authorized mode\r\nthe general diffusion of knowledge which guarantees to public liberty its\r\npermanency and to those who possess the blessing the true enjoyment of it;\r\na Government which avoids intrusions on the internal repose of other\r\nnations, and repels them from its own; which does justice to all nations\r\nwith a readiness equal to the firmness with which it requires justice from\r\nthem; and which, whilst it refines its domestic code from every ingredient\r\nnot congenial with the precepts of an enlightened age and the sentiments of\r\na virtuous people, seeks by appeals to reason and by its liberal examples\r\nto infuse into the law which governs the civilized world a spirit which may\r\ndiminish the frequency or circumscribe the calamities of war, and meliorate\r\nthe social and beneficent relations of peace; a Government, in a word,\r\nwhose conduct within and without may bespeak the most noble of ambitions--\r\nthat of promoting peace on earth and good will to man.\r\n\r\nThese contemplations, sweetening the remnant of my days, will animate my\r\nprayers for the happiness of my beloved country, and a perpetuity of the\r\ninstitutions under which it is enjoyed.",
