XIV.--SEPTEMBER, 1864.--NO. LXXXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nEntered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1864, by TICKNOR AND\r\nFIELDS, in the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the District of\r\nMassachusetts.\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Note: Minor typos have been corrected and footnotes moved\r\nto the end of the article.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CADMEAN MADNESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn old English divine fancied that all the world might go mad and nobody\r\nknow it. The conception suggests a query whether the standard of sanity,\r\nas of fashions and prices, be not a purely artificial one, an accident\r\nof convention, a law of society, an arbitrary institute, and therefore a\r\npossible mistake. A sage and a maniac each thinks the other mad. The\r\ndecision is a matter of majorities. Should a whole community become\r\ninsane, it would nevertheless vote itself wise; if the craze of Bedlam\r\nwere uniform, its inmates could not distinguish it from a Pantheon; and\r\nthough all human history seemed to the gods only as a continuous series\r\nof mediæval processions _des sots et des ânes_, yet the topsy-turvy\r\nintellect of the world would ever worship folly in the name of wisdom.\r\nArts and sciences, ideas and institutions, laws and learning would still\r\nabound, transmogrified to suit the reigning madness. And as statistics\r\nreveal the late gradual and general increase of insanity, it becomes a\r\nprovident people to consider what may be the ultimate results, if this\r\nincrease should happen never to be checked. And if sanity be, indeed, a\r\nglory which we might all lose unawares, we may well betake ourselves to\r\nvery solemn reflection as to whether we are, at the present moment, in\r\nour wits and senses, or not.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar proficiencies of great epochs are as astonishing as the\r\nexploits of individual frenzy. The era of the Greek rhapsodists, when a\r\nbody of matchless epical literature was handed down by memory from\r\ngeneration to generation, and a recitation of the whole \"Odyssey\" was\r\nnot too much for a dinner-party,--the era of Periclean culture, when the\r\nAthenian populace was wont to pass whole days in the theatre, attending\r\nwith unfaltering intellectual keenness and æsthetic delight to three or\r\nfour long dramas, either of which would exhaust a modern audience,--the\r\nwild and vast systems of imaginary abstractions, which the\r\nNeo-Platonists, as also the German transcendentalists, so strangely\r\ndevised and became enamored of,--the grotesque views of men and things,\r\nthe funny universe altogether, which made up both the popular and the\r\nlearned thought of the Middle Ages,--the Buddhistic Orient, with its\r\nsubtile metaphysical illusions, its unreal astronomical heavens, its\r\nhabits of repose and its tornadoes of passion,--such are instances of\r\ngreat diversities of character, which would be hardly accountable to\r\neach other on the supposition of mutual sanity. They suggest a\r\ndifference of ideas, moods, habits, and capacities, which in\r\ncontemporaries and associates would amply justify either party that\r\nhappened to be the majority in turning all the rest into insane asylums.\r\nIt is the demoniac element, the raving of some particular demon, that\r\ncreates greatness either in men or nations. Power is maniacal. A\r\nmysterious fury, a heavenly inspiration, an incomprehensible and\r\nirresistible impulse, goads humanity on to achievements. Every age,\r\nevery person, and every art obeys the wand of the enchanter. History\r\nmoves by indirections. The first historic tendency is likely to be\r\nslightly askew; there follows then an historic triumph, then an historic\r\neccentricity, then an historic folly, then an explosion; and then the\r\nseries begins again. In the grade of folly, hard upon an explosion, lies\r\nmodern literature.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic mania of the last two centuries is reading and\r\nwriting. Solomon discovered that much study is a weariness of the flesh;\r\nAristophanes complained of the multitude and indignity of authors in his\r\ntime; and the famed preacher, Geyler von Kaisersberg, in the age of\r\nprevalent monkery and Benedictine plodding, mentioned erudition and\r\nmadness, on equal footing, as the twin results of books: \"_Libri quosdam\r\nad scientiam, quosdam ad insaniam deduxere_.\" These were successive\r\nsymptoms of the growing malady. But where there was one writer in the\r\ntime of Geyler, there are a million now. He saw both health and disease,\r\nand could distinguish between them. We see only the latter. Skill in\r\nletters, half a decade of centuries ago, was a miraculous attainment,\r\nand placed its possessor in the rank of divines and diviners; now,\r\ninability to read and write is accounted, with pauperism and crime, a\r\nground for civil disfranchisement. The old feudal merry and hearty\r\nignorance has been everywhere corrupted by books and newspapers,\r\nlearning and intelligence, the cabalistic words of modern life. Popular\r\npoetry and music, ballads and legends, wit and originality have\r\ndisappeared before the barbaric intellectuality of our Cadmean idolatry.\r\nEven the arts of conversation and oratory are waning, and may soon be\r\nlost; we live only in second and silent thoughts: for who will waste\r\nfame and fortune by giving to his friends the gems which will delight\r\nmankind? and how can a statesman grapple eloquently with Fate, when the\r\ncontest is not to be determined on the spot, but by quiet and remote\r\npeople coolly reading his speech several hours or days later? Even if we\r\nwere vagarying into imbecility, like the wildest Neo-Platonic\r\nhierophants, like the monkish chroniclers of the Middle Ages, like other\r\nromantic and fantastic theorists who have leaped out of human nature\r\ninto a purely artificial realm, we should not know it, because we are\r\nall doing it uniformly.\r\n\r\nThe universe is a veiled Isis. The human mind from immemorial antiquity\r\nhas ceased to regard it. A small cohort of alphabets has enrobed it with\r\na wavy texture of letters, beyond which we cannot penetrate. The glamour\r\nis upon us, and when we would see the facts of Nature, we behold only\r\ntracts of print. The God of the heavens and earth has hidden Himself\r\nfrom us since we gave ourselves up to the worship of the false\r\ndivinities of Phoenicia. No longer can we admire the _cosmos_; for the\r\n_cosmos_ lies beyond a long perspective of theorems and propositions\r\nthat cross our eyes, like countless bees, from the alcoves of\r\nphilosophies and sciences. No longer do we bask in the beauty of things,\r\nas in the sunlight; for when we would melt in feeling, we hear nothing\r\nbut the rattling of gems of verse. No longer does the mind, as\r\nsympathetic priest and interpreter, hover amid the phenomena of time and\r\nspace; for the forms of Nature have given place to volumes, there are no\r\nobjects but pages, and passions have been supplanted by paragraphs. We\r\nno longer see the whirling universe, or feel the pulsing of life.\r\nThought itself has ceased to be a sprite, and flows through the mind\r\nonly in the leaden shape of printed sentences. The symbolism of letters\r\nis over us all. An all-pervading nominalism has completely masked\r\nwhatsoever there is that is real. More and more it is not the soul and\r\nNature, but the eye and print, whose resultant is thought. Nature\r\ndisappears and the mind withers. No other faculty has been developed in\r\nman but that of the reader, no other possibility but that of the writer.\r\nThe old-fashioned arts which used to imply human nature, which used to\r\nblossom instinctively, which have given joy and beauty to society, are\r\nfading from the face of the earth. Where are the ancient and mediæval\r\npopular games, those charming vital symptoms? The people now read\r\nDickens and Longfellow. Where are the old-fashioned instincts of worship\r\nand love, consolation and mourning? The people have since found an\r\nantidote for these experiences in Blair and Tupper, and other authors of\r\nrenown. Where are those weird voices of the air and forest and stream,\r\nthose symptoms of an enchanted Nature, which used to thrill and bless\r\nthe soul of man? The duller ear of men has failed to hear them in this\r\nage of popular science.\r\n\r\nLiterature, using the word with a benevolent breadth of meaning which\r\nexcludes no pretenders, is the result of the invasion of letters. It is\r\nthe fort which they occupy, which with too hasty consideration has\r\nusually been regarded as friendly to the human race. Religions, laws,\r\nsciences, arts, theories, and histories, instead of passing Ariel-like\r\ninto the elements when their task is done, are made perpetual prisoners\r\nin the alcoves of dreary libraries. They have a fossil immortality,\r\nsurviving themselves in covers, as poems have survived minstrels. The\r\nmemory of man is made omni-capacious; its burden increases with every\r\ngeneration; not even the ignorance and stolidity of the past are allowed\r\nthe final grace of being forgotten; and omniscience is becoming at once\r\nmore and more impossible and more and more fashionable. Whoever reads\r\nonly the books of his own time is superficial in proportion to the\r\nthickness of the ages. But neither the genius of man, nor his length of\r\ndays, has had an increase corresponding to that of the realm of\r\nknowledge, the requirements of reading, and the conditions of\r\nintelligence. The multiplied attractions only crowd and obstruct the\r\nnecessarily narrow line of duty, possibility, and destiny. Life\r\nthreatens to be extinguished by its own shadow, by the _débris_ kept in\r\nthe current by countless tenacious records. Its essence escapes to\r\nheaven or into new forms, but its ghosts still walk the earth in print.\r\nLike that mythical serpent which advanced only as it grew in length, so\r\nknowledge spans the whole length of the ages. Some philosopher conceived\r\nof history as the migration and growth of reason throughout time,\r\nculminating in successive historical ideas. He, however, supposed that\r\nthe idea of every age had nothing to do with any preceding age; it had\r\npassed through whatsoever previous stages, had been somewhat modified by\r\nthem, contained in itself all that was best in them, was improved and\r\nelevated at every new epoch; but it had no memory, never looked\r\nbackward, and was an ever rolling sphere, complete in itself, leaving no\r\ntrail behind. Human life, under the discipline of letters and common\r\nschools, is not thus Hegelian, but advances under the boundless\r\nretrospection of literature. And yet this is probably divine philosophy.\r\nIt is probable that the faculty of memory belongs to man only in an\r\nimmature state of development, and that in some future and happier epoch\r\nthe past will be known to us only as it lives in the present; and then\r\nfor the first time will Realism in life take the place of Nominalism.\r\n\r\nThe largest library in the world, the Bibliothèque Impériale of Paris,\r\n(it has been successively, like the adventurous and versatile throne of\r\nFrance, Royale, Nationale, and Impériale,) contains very nearly one\r\nmillion of books, the collected fruits of all time. Consider an average\r\nbook in that collection: how much human labor does it stand for? How\r\nmuch capital was invested originally in its production, and how much\r\ntribute of time and toil does it receive per annum? Regarding books as\r\nintellectual estate, how much does it cost mankind to procure and keep\r\nup an average specimen? What quantity of human resources has been\r\noriginally and consecutively sunk in the Parisian library? How much of\r\nhuman time, which is but a span, and of human emotion and thought, which\r\nare sacred and not to be carelessly thrown away, lie latent therein?\r\n\r\nThe estimate must be highly speculative. Some books have cost a lifetime\r\nand a heartbreak; others have been written at leisure in a week, and\r\nwithout an emotion. Some are born from the martyrdom of a thinker to\r\nfire the genius of a populace; others are the coruscations of joy, and\r\nhave a smile for their immortal heir. Some have made but the slightest\r\nmomentary ripple in human affairs; others, first gathering eddies about\r\nthemselves, have swept forward in grand currents, engrossing for\r\ncenturies whole departments of human energy. Thousands publish and are\r\nforgotten before they die. Spinoza published after his death and is not\r\nyet understood.\r\n\r\nWe will begin with the destined bibliomacher at the time of his\r\nassumption of short clothes. The alphabet is his first professional\r\ntorture, and that only ushers him upon the gigantic task of learning to\r\nread and write his own language. Experience shows that this miracle of\r\nmemory and associative reason may be in the main accomplished by the\r\ntime he is eight years old. Thus far in his progress towards book-making\r\nhe has simply got his fingers hold of the pen. He has next to run the\r\ngauntlet of the languages, sciences, and arts, to pass through the epoch\r\nof the scholar, with satchel under his arm, with pale cheek, an eremite\r\nand ascetic in the religion of Cadmus. At length, at about twenty years\r\nof age, he leaves the university, not a master, but a bachelor of\r\nliberal studies. But thus far he has laid only the foundation, has\r\nacquired only rudiments and generalities, has only served his\r\napprenticeship to letters. God gave mind and nature, but art has\r\nfurnished him a new capacity and a new world,--the capacity to read, and\r\nthe world of books. He has simply acquired a new nature, a psychological\r\ntexture of letters, but the artificial _tabula rasa_ has yet to be\r\nfilled. Twenty obstetrical years have at last made him a literary\r\nanimal, have furnished him the abstract conditions of authorship; but he\r\nhas yet his life to save, and his fortune to make in literature. He is\r\nborn into the mystic fraternity of readers and writers, but the special\r\nstudies and experiences which fit him for anything, which make a book\r\npossible, are still in the future. He will be fortunate, if he gets\r\nthrough with them, and gets his first volume off his hands by the age of\r\nthirty. Authors are the shortest-lived of men. Their average years are\r\nless than fifty. Our bibliomacher has therefore twenty years left to\r\nhim. Taking all time together, since formerly authors wrote less\r\nabundantly than now, he will not produce more than one work in five\r\nyears, that is, five works in his lifetime of fifty years. The\r\nconclusion to which this rather precarious investigation thus brings us\r\nis, that the original cost of an average book is ten years of a human\r\nlife. And yet these ten years make but the mere suggestion of the book.\r\nThe suggestion must be developed by an army of printers, sellers, and\r\nlibrarians. What other institution in the world is there but the\r\nBibliothèque Impériale, to the mere suggestion of which ten millions of\r\nlaborious years have been devoted?\r\n\r\nStartling considerations present themselves. If there were no other\r\n_argumentum ad absurdum_ to demonstrate some fundamental perversity and\r\nabsurdity in literature, it might be suspected from the fact that Nature\r\nherself gives so little encouragement to it. Nobody is born an author.\r\nThe art of writing, common as it is, is not indigenous in man, but is\r\nacquired by a nearly universal martyrdom of youth. If it had been\r\nprovidentially designed that the function of any considerable portion of\r\nmankind should have been to write books, we cannot suppose that an\r\neconomical Deity would have failed to create them with innate skill in\r\nlanguage, general knowledge, and penmanship. These accomplishments have\r\nto be learned by every writer, yet writers are numberless. They are\r\nmysteries which must be painfully encountered by every one at the\r\nvestibule of the temple of literature, which nevertheless is thronged.\r\nSurely, had this importance and prevalence been attached to them in the\r\nDivine scheme, they would have been born in us like the senses, or would\r\nblossom spontaneously in us, like the corollal growths of Faith and\r\nConscience. We should have been created in a condition of literary\r\ncapacity, and thus have been spared the alphabetical torture of\r\nchildhood, and the academic depths of philological despair. Twenty-five\r\nyears of preliminaries might have been avoided by changing the peg in\r\nthe scale of creation, and the studies of the boy might have begun where\r\nnow they end. Twenty-five years in the span of life would thus have been\r\nsaved, had what must be a universal acquirement been incorporated into\r\nthe original programme of human nature.\r\n\r\nOr had the Deity appreciated literature as we do, He would probably have\r\nwritten out the universe in some snug little volume, some miniature\r\nseries, or some boundless Bodleian, instead of unfolding it through\r\ninfinite space and time, as an actual, concrete, unwritten reality. Be\r\ncreation a single act or an eternal process, it would have been all a\r\nthing of books. The Divine Mind would have revealed itself in a library,\r\ninstead of in the universe. As for men, they would have existed only in\r\ntreatises on the mammalia. There are some specimens which we hardly\r\nthink are according to any anticipation of heavenly reason, and\r\ntherefore they would not have existed at all. Nothing would have been\r\nbut God and literature. Possibly a responsible creation like ours might\r\nhave been formed, nevertheless, by making each letter a living,\r\nthinking, moral agent; and the alphabet might thus have written out the\r\nDivine ideas, as men now work them out. If the conception seem to any\r\none chilly, if it have a dreary look, if it appear to leave only a\r\nfrosty metallic base, instead of the grand oceanic effervescence of\r\nlife, let him remember how often earthly authors have renounced living\r\nrealities, all personal sympathies and pleasures, communing only with\r\nbooks, their minds dwelling apart from men. Remember Tasso and Southey;\r\nay, if you have yourself written a book that commands admiration,\r\nremember what it cost you. Why hesitate to transfer to the skies a type\r\nof life which we admire here below? But God having wrought out instead\r\nof written out His thoughts, does it not appear that He designed for men\r\nto do likewise?\r\n\r\nAnd thus a new consideration is presented. The exhibit of the original\r\ncost of the Bibliothèque Impériale was the smallest item in our budget.\r\nMark the history of a book. How variously it engrosses the efforts of\r\nthe world, from the time when it first rushes into the arena of life!\r\nThe industry of printing embodies it, the energy of commerce disperses\r\nit, the army of critics announce it, the world of readers give their\r\ndays and nights to it generation after generation, and its echoes\r\nuninterruptedly repeat themselves along the infinite procession of\r\nwriters. The process reverts with every new edition, and eddies mingle\r\nwith eddies in the motley march of history. Its story may be traced in\r\nmartyrdoms of the flesh, in weary hours, strange experiences, unhappy\r\ntempers, restless struggles, unrequited triumphs,--in the glare of\r\nmidnight lamps, and of wild, haggard eyes,--in sorrow, want, desolation,\r\ndespair, and madness. Born in sorrow, the book trails a pathway of\r\nsorrow through the ages. And each book in the Parisian library stands\r\nfor all this,--some that were produced with tears having been always\r\nread for jest,--some that were lightly written being now severe tasks\r\nfor historians, antiquaries, and source-mongers.\r\n\r\nSuppose an old Egyptian, who in primæval Hierapolis incased his thought\r\nin papyrus, to be able now to take a stroll into the Bibliothèque, and\r\nto see what has become of his thought so far as there represented. He\r\nwould find that it had haunted mankind ever since. An alcove would be\r\nfilled with commentaries on it, and discussions as to where it came from\r\nand what it meant. He would find it modifying and modified by the\r\nGreeks, and reproduced by them with divers variations,--extinguished by\r\nChristianity,--revived, with a new face, among the theurgies and cabala\r\nof Alexandria; he would catch the merest glimpse of it amid the\r\nChristian legends and credulities of the Middle Ages,--but the Arabs\r\nwould have kept a stronger hold on it; he would see it in the background\r\nafter the revival of learning, till, gradually, as modern commerce\r\nopened the East, scholars, also, discovered that there were wonders\r\nbehind the classic nations; and finally he would see how modern\r\nresearch, rushing back through comparison of language-roots, through\r\ngeological data, through ethnological indications, through antiquarian\r\ndiscoveries, has rooted out of the layers of ages all the history\r\nattendant upon its original production. He would find the records of\r\nthis long history in the library around him. In every age, the thought,\r\nborn of pain, has been reproduced with travail. It did not do its\r\nmission at once, penetrate like a ray of light into the heart of the\r\nrace, and leave a chemical effect which should last forever. No, the\r\nblood of man's spirit was not purified,--only an external application\r\nwas made, and that application must be repeated with torture upon every\r\ngeneration. Was this designed to be the function of thought, the mission\r\nof heavenly ideas?\r\n\r\nThis is the history of his thought in books. But let us conceive what\r\nmight have been its history but for the books;--how it might have been\r\nwritten in the fibres of the soul, and lived in eternal reason, instead\r\nof having been written on papyrus and involved in the realm of dead\r\nmatter. His idea, thrilling his own soul, would have revealed itself in\r\nevery particle and movement of his body; for \"soul is form, and doth the\r\nbody make.\" Its first product would have been his own quivering,\r\nanimated, and animating personality. He would have impressed every one\r\nof his associates, every one of whom would in turn have impressed a new\r\ncrowd, and thus the immortal array of influences would have gone on. Not\r\nimpressions on parchment, but impressions on the soul, not letters, but\r\nthrills, would have been its result. Thus the magic of personal\r\ninfluence of all kinds would have radiated from it in omnipresent and\r\ncolliding circlets forever, as the mighty imponderable agents are\r\nbelieved to radiate from some hidden focal force. He would trace his\r\nidea in the massive architecture and groping science of Egypt,--in the\r\nelegant forms of worship, thought, institutes, and life among the\r\nGreeks,--in the martial and systematizing genius of Rome,--and so on\r\nthrough the ecclesiastical life of the Middle Ages, and the political\r\nand scientific ambitions of modern times. Its operations have everywhere\r\nbeen chemical, not mechanical. It has lived, not in the letter, but in\r\nthe spirit. Never dropping to the earth, it has been maintained as a\r\nshuttlecock in spiritual regions by the dynamics of the soul. It has\r\nwrought itself into the soul, the only living and immortal thing, and so\r\nthe proper place for ideas. Its mode of transmission has been by the\r\nsuffusion of the eye, the cheek, the lip, the manner, not by dead and\r\nunsymbolical letters. It has had life, and not merely duration. It has\r\nbeen perpetuated in cordate, not in dactylate characters. Its history\r\nmust not be sought away from the circle of life, but may be seen in the\r\ncurrent generation of men. The man whom you should meet on the street\r\nwould be the product of all the ideas and influences from the\r\nfoundation of the world, and his slightest act would reveal them all\r\nvital within him. The libraries, which form dead recesses in the river\r\nof life, would thus be swept into and dissolved in the current, and the\r\nwaters would have been deepened and colored by their dissolution.\r\nLibraries are a sort of _débris_ of the world, but the spiritual\r\nsubstance of them would thus enter into the organism of history. All the\r\nlast results of time would come to us, not through books, but through\r\nthe impressions of daily life. Whatsoever was unworthy to be woven into\r\nthe fibres of the soul would be overwhelmed by that oblivion which\r\nchases humanity; all the time wasted in the wrong-headedness of\r\narchæology would be saved; for there would be nothing of the past except\r\nits influence on the immediate present, and nothing but the pure human\r\ningot would finally be left of the long whirlings in the crucible of\r\nhistory. Some one has said that all recent literature is one gigantic\r\nplagiarism from the past. Why plagiarize with toil the toils of the\r\npast, when all that is good in them lives, necessarily and of its own\r\ntendency, in the winged and growing spirit of man? The stream flows in a\r\nchannel, and is colored by all the ores of its banks, but it would be\r\nabsurd for it to attempt to take the channel up and carry it along with\r\nitself out into the sea. Why should the tinted water of life attempt to\r\ncarry along with it not only the tint, but also the bank, ages back,\r\nfrom which the tint proceeds?\r\n\r\nAs the world goes on, the multitude of books increases. They grow as\r\ngrows the human race,--but, unlike the human race, they have a material\r\nimmortality here below. Fossil books, unlike fossil rocks, have a power\r\nof reproduction. Every new year leaves not only a new inheritance, but\r\ngenerally a larger one than ever before. What is to be the result? The\r\nultimate prospect is portentous. If England has produced ten thousand\r\nvolumes of fiction (about three thousand new novels) during the last\r\nforty years, how many books of all kinds has Christendom to answer for\r\nin the same period? If the British Museum makes it a point to preserve a\r\ncopy of everything that is published, how long will it be before the\r\nwhole world will not be sufficient to contain the multitude thereof? At\r\npresent all the collections of the Museum, books, etc., occupy only\r\nforty acres on the soil, and an average of two hundred feet towards the\r\nsky. But even these outlines indicate a block of space which under\r\ngeometrical increase would in the shortest of geological periods make a\r\nmore complete conquest of the earth than has ever been made by fire or\r\nwater. To say nothing of the sorrows of the composition of these new\r\nliterary stores, how is man, whose years are threescore-and-ten, going\r\nto read them? Surely the green earth will be transformed into a\r\nwilderness of books, and man, reduced from the priest and interpreter of\r\nNature to a bookworm, will be like the beasts which perish.\r\n\r\nThe eye of fancy lately witnessed in a dream the vision of an age far in\r\nthe future. The surface of the earth was covered with lofty rectangles,\r\nbuilt up coral-like from small rectangles. There was neither tree nor\r\nherb nor living creature. Walled paths, excavated ruts, alone broke the\r\ndesert-like prospect, as the burrows of life. Penetrating into these,\r\nthe eye saw men walking beneath the striated piles, with heads bent\r\nforward and nervous fingering of brow. There the whole world, such as we\r\nhave known it, was buried beneath volumes, past all enumeration. There\r\nwas neither fauna nor flora, neither wilderness, tempest, nor any\r\nfamiliar look of Nature, but only one boundless contiguity of books.\r\nThere was only man and space and one unceasing library, and the men\r\nneither ate nor slept nor spoke. Nature was transformed into the\r\nprocesses and products of writing, and man was now no longer lover,\r\nfriend, peasant, merchant, naturalist, traveller, gourmet, mechanic,\r\nwarrior, worshipper, but only an author. All other faculties had been\r\nlost to him, and all resources for anything else had fled from his\r\nuniverse. Anon some wrinkled, fidgety, cogitative being in human form\r\nwould add a new volume to some slope or tower of the monstrous\r\nomni-patulent mass, or some sharp-glancing youth, with teeth set\r\nunevenly on edge, would pull out a volume, look greedily and\r\nhalf-believingly for a few moments, return it, and slink away. \"What is\r\nthis world, and what means this life?\" cried I, addressing an old man,\r\nwho had just tossed a volume aloft. \"Where are we, and what about this?\r\nTell me, for I have not before seen and do not know.\" He glanced a\r\nmoment, then spoke, like a shade in hell, as follows:--\"This is the\r\nworld, and here is human life. Man long enjoyed it, with wonderful\r\nfulness and freshness of being. But a madness seized him; everybody\r\nwrote books; the evil grew more and more; nought else was an object of\r\npursuit; till at last the earth was covered with tomes, and for long\r\nages now it has been buried beyond the reach of mortal. All forms of\r\nlife were exterminated. Man himself survives only as a literary shadow.\r\nEach one writes a book, or a few books, and dies, vanishing into thin\r\nair. Such is life,--a hecatomb!\"\r\n\r\nBut even if it be supposed that mind could survive the toil, and the\r\nearth the quantity of our accumulating books, there are other\r\ndifficulties. There are other imperative limitations, beyond which the\r\nart of writing cannot go. Letters themselves limit the possibilities of\r\nliterature. For there is only a certain number of letters. These letters\r\nare capable of only a certain number of combinations into words. This\r\nlimited number of possible words is capable only of a certain number of\r\narrangements. Conceive the effect when all these capabilities shall be\r\nexhausted! It will no longer be possible for a new thing to be said or\r\nwritten. We shall have only to select and repeat from the past. Writing\r\nshall be reduced to the making of extracts, and speaking to the making\r\nof quotations. Yet the condition of things would certainly be improved.\r\nAs there is now a great deal of writing without thinking, so then\r\nthinking could go on without writing. A man would be obliged to think\r\nout and up to his result, as we do now; but whether his processes and\r\nconclusions were wise or foolish, he would find them written out for him\r\nin advance. The process of selection would be all. The immense amount of\r\nwriting would cease. Authors would be extinct. Thinkers could find their\r\nideas stated in the best possible way, and the most effective arguments\r\nin their favor. If this event seems at all unlikely to any one, let him\r\nonly reflect on the long geological ages, and on the innumerable\r\nwritings, short and long, now published daily,--from Mr. Buckle to the\r\nnewspapers. Estimate everything in type daily throughout Christendom. If\r\nso much is done in a day, how much in a few decades of centuries?\r\nSurely, at our present rate, in a very conceivable length of time, the\r\nresources of two alphabets would be exhausted. And this may be the\r\nreason and providence in the amount of writing now going on,--to get\r\nhuman language written up. The earth is as yet not half explored, and\r\nits cultivation and development, in comparison with what shall some time\r\nbe, have scarcely begun. Will not the race be blessed, when its two\r\nmortal foes, Nature and the alphabet, have been finally and forever\r\nsubdued?\r\n\r\nThis necessary finiteness of literature may be illustrated in another\r\nway. An English mathematician of the seventeenth century applied the\r\nresources of his art to an enumeration of human ideas. He believed that\r\nhe could calculate with rigorous exactness the number of ideas of which\r\nthe human mind is susceptible. This number, according to him, (and he\r\nhas never been disputed,) was 3,155,760,000. Even if we allowed\r\na million of words to one idea, according to our present\r\npractice,--instead of a single word to an idea, which would seem\r\nreasonable,--still, all the possible combinations of words and ideas\r\nwould finally be exhausted. The ideas would give out, to be sure, a\r\nmillion of times before the words; but the latter would meet their doom\r\nat last. All possible ideas would then be served up in all possible ways\r\nfor all men, who could order them according to their appetites, and we\r\ncould dispense with cooks ever after. The written word would be the\r\nfinished record of all possible worlds, in gross and in detail.\r\n\r\nBut the problem whose solution has thus been attempted by desperate\r\nsuggestions has, by changing its elements, nullified our calculation. We\r\nhave been plotting to cast out the demon of books; and, lo! three other\r\nkindred demons of quarterlies, monthlies, and newspapers have joined\r\nfellowship with it, and our latter estate is worse than our first.\r\nIndeed, we may anticipate the speedy fossilization and extinction of\r\nbooks, while these younger broods alone shall occupy the earth. Our\r\nlibraries are already hardly more than museums, they will soon be\r\n_mausoleums_, while all our reading is of the winged words of the\r\nhurried contributor. Some of the most intelligent and influential men in\r\nlarge cities do not read a book once a year. The Cadmean magic has\r\npassed from the hands of hierophants into those of the people.\r\nLiterature has fallen from the domain of immortal thought to that of\r\nephemeral speech, from the conditions of a fine to those of a mechanical\r\nart. The order of genius has been abolished by an all-prevailing popular\r\nopinion. The elegance and taste of patient culture have been vulgarized\r\nby forced contact with the unpresentable facts thrust upon us by the\r\nready writer. Everybody now sighs for the new periodical, while nobody\r\nhas read the literature of any single age in any single country.\r\n\r\nHow like mountain-billows of barbarism do the morning journals, reeking\r\nwith unkempt facts, roll in upon the peaceful thought of the soul! How\r\nlike savage hordes from some remote star, some nebulous chaos, that has\r\nnever yet been recognized in the cosmical world, do they trample upon\r\nthe organic and divine growths of culture, laying waste the well-ordered\r\nand fairly adorned fields of the mind, demolishing the intellectual\r\nhighways which great engineering thinkers have constructed within us,\r\nand reducing a domain in which poetry and philosophy, with their sacred\r\nbroods, dwelt gloriously together, to an undistinguishable level of\r\nruin! How helpless are we before a newspaper! We sit down to it a highly\r\ndeveloped and highly civilized being; we leave it a barbarian. Step by\r\nstep, blow by blow, has everything that was nobly formed within us been\r\nknocked down, and we are made illustrations of the atomic theory of the\r\nsoul, every atom being a separate savage, after the social theory of\r\nHobbes. We are crazed by a multitudinousness of details, till the eye\r\nsees no picture, the ear hears no music, the taste finds no beauty, and\r\nthe reason grasps no system. The only wonder is that the diabolical\r\ninvention of Faust or Gutenberg has not already transformed the growths\r\nof the mind into a fauna and flora of perdition.\r\n\r\nIt was a sad barbarism when men ran wild with their own impulses, unable\r\nto control the fierceness of instinct. It is a sadder barbarism when men\r\nyield to every impulse from without, with no imperial dignity in the\r\nsoul, which closes the apartments against the violence of the world and\r\nfrowns away unseemly intruders. We have no spontaneous enthusiasm, no\r\nspiritual independence, no inner being, obedient only to its own law. We\r\ndo not plough the billows of time with true beak and steady weight, but\r\nfloat, a tossed cork, now one side up and now the other. We live the\r\nlife of an insect accidentally caught within a drum. Every steamer that\r\ncomes hits the drum a beat; every telegram taps it; it echoes with every\r\nrepresentative's speech, reverberates with every senator's more portly\r\neffort, screams at every accident. Everything that is done in the\r\nuniverse seems to be done only to make a noise upon it. Every morning,\r\nwhatsoever thing has been changed, and whatsoever thing has been\r\nunchanged, during the night, comes up to batter its report on the\r\nomni-audient tympanum of the universe, the drum-head of the press. And\r\nthen we are inside of it. It may be music to the gods who dwell beyond\r\nthe blue ether, but it is terrible confusion to us.\r\n\r\nVirgil exhausted the resources of his genius in his portraiture of\r\nFame:--\r\n\r\n    \"Fama, malum, quo non aliud velocius ullum:\r\n    Mobilitate viget, viresque acquirit eundo:\r\n    Parva metu primo; mox sese attollit in auras,\r\n    Ingrediturque solo, et caput inter nubila condit.\r\n\r\n     *** *** *** ***\r\n\r\n    Tot linguæ, totidem ora sonant, tot subrigit aures.\r\n    Nocte volat coeli medio terræque per umbram\r\n    Stridens, nec dulci declinat lumina somno.\"\r\n\r\nWhat would he have done, had he known our modern monster, the\r\nalphabet-tongued, steel-sinewed, kettle-lunged Rumor? It is a sevenfold\r\nhorror. The Virgilian Fame was not a mechanical, but a living thing; it\r\ngrew as it ran; it at least gave a poetical impression. Its story grew\r\nas legends grow, full to the brim of the instincts of the popular\r\ngenius. It left its traces as it passed, and the minds of all who saw\r\nand heard rested in delightful wonder till something new happened. But\r\nthe fact which printed Rumor throws through the atmosphere is coupled\r\nnot with, the beauty of poetry, but with the madness of dissertation.\r\nEverybody is not only informed that the Jackats defeated the Magnats on\r\nthe banks of the Kaiger on the last day of last week, but this news is\r\nconveyed to them in connection with a series of revelations about the\r\nrelations of said fact to the universe. The primordial germ is not\r\npoetical, but dissertational. It tends to no organic creation, but to\r\nany abnormal and multitudinous display of suggestions, hypotheses, and\r\nprophecies. The item is shaped as it passes, not by the hopes and fears\r\nof the soul, but grows by accumulation of the dull details of prose. We\r\nhave neither the splendid bewilderments of the twelfth, nor the cold\r\nillumination of the eighteenth century, but bewilderments without\r\nsplendor, and coldness without illumination. The world is too wide-awake\r\nfor thought,--the atmosphere is too bright for intellectual\r\nachievements. We have the wonders and sensations of a day; but where are\r\nthe fathomless profundities, the long contemplations, and the silent\r\nsolemnities of life? The newspapers are marvels of mental industry. They\r\nshow how much work can be done in a day, but they never last more than a\r\nday. Sad will it be when the genius of ephemerality has invaded all\r\ndepartments of human actions and human motives! Farewell then to deep\r\nthoughts, to sublime self-sacrifice, to heroic labors for lasting\r\nresults! Time is turned into a day, the mind knows only momentary\r\nimpressions, the weary way of art is made as short as a turnpike, and\r\nthe products of genius last only about as long as any mood of the\r\nweather. Bleak and changeable March will rule the year in the\r\nintellectual heavens.\r\n\r\nWhat symbol could represent this matchless embodiment of all the\r\nactivities, this tremendous success, this frenzied public interest? A\r\nmonster so large, and yet so quick,--so much bulk combined with so much\r\nreadiness,--reaching so far, and yet striking so often! Who can conceive\r\nthat productive state of mind in which some current fact is all the time\r\nwhirling the universe about it? Who can understand the mania of the\r\nleader-writer, who never thinks of a subject without discovering the\r\npossibility of a column concerning it,--who never looks upon his plate\r\nof soup without mentally reviewing in elaborate periods the whole\r\nvegetable, animal, and mineral kingdoms?\r\n\r\nBut what is the advantage of newspapers? Forsooth, popular intelligence.\r\nThe newspaper is, in the first place, the legitimate and improved\r\nsuccessor of the fiery cross, beacon-light, signal-smoking summit,\r\nhieroglyphic mark, and bulletin-board. It is, in addition to this, a\r\npopular daily edition and application of the works of Aristotle, St.\r\nThomas Aquinas, Lord Bacon, Vattel, and Thomas Jefferson. On one page it\r\nrecords items, on the other it shows the relations between those items\r\nand the highest thought. Yet the whole circle is accomplished daily. The\r\njournal is thus the synopticized, personified, incarnate madness of the\r\nday,--for to-day is always mad, and becomes a thing of reason only when\r\nit becomes yesterday. A proper historical fact is one of the rarest\r\nshots in the journalist's bag, as time is sure to prove. If we had\r\nnewspaper-accounts of the age of Augustus, the chances are that no other\r\nepoch in history would be so absolutely problematical, and Augustus\r\nhimself would be lucky, if he were not resolved into a myth, and the\r\njournal into sibylline oracles. The dissertational department is equally\r\nfaulty; for to first impressions everything on earth is chameleon-like.\r\nThe Scandinavian Divinities, the Past, the Present, and the Future,\r\ncould look upon each other, but neither of them upon herself. But in the\r\njournal the Present is trying to behold itself; the same priestess\r\nutters and explains the oracle. Thus the journal is the immortal\r\nreproduction of the _jour des dupes_. The editors are like the newsboys,\r\nshouting the news which they do not understand.\r\n\r\nThe public mind has given itself up to it. It claims the right to\r\npronounce all the newspapers very bad, but has renounced the privilege\r\nof not reading them. Every one is made _particeps criminis_ in the\r\ncourse of events. Nothing takes place in any quarter of the globe\r\nwithout our assistance. We have to connive at _omne scibile_. About\r\neverything natural and human, infernal and divine, there is a general\r\nconsultation of mankind, and we are all made responsible for the result.\r\nYet this constant interruption of our private intellectual habits and\r\ninterests is both an impertinence and a nuisance. Why send us all the\r\ncrudities? Why call upon us till you know what you want? Why speak till\r\nyou have got your brain and your mouth clear? Why may we not take the\r\nuniverse for granted when we get up in the morning, instead of\r\nproceeding directly to measure it over again? Once a year is often\r\nenough for anybody but the government to hear anything about India,\r\nChina, Patagonia, and the other flaps and coat-tails of the world. Let\r\nthe North Pole never be mentioned again till we can melt the icebergs by\r\na burning mirror before we start. Don't report another asteroid till the\r\nnumber reaches a thousand; that will be time enough for us to change our\r\npeg. Let us hear nothing of the small speeches, but Congress may publish\r\nonce a week a bulletin of what it has done. The President and Cabinet\r\nmay publish a bulletin, not to exceed five lines, twice a week, or on\r\nrare occasions and in a public emergency once a day. The right, however,\r\nshall be reserved to the people to prohibit the Cabinet from saying\r\nanything more aloud on a particular public question, till they have\r\nsettled it. Let no mail-steamer pass between here and Europe oftener\r\nthan once a month,--let all other steamers be forbidden to bring news,\r\nand the utterance of news by passengers be treated either as a public\r\nlibel or nuisance, or as high treason. Leave the awful accidents to the\r\nparties whom they concern, and don't trouble us, unless they have the\r\nmerit of novelty as well as of horror. Tell us only the highest facts,\r\nthe boldest strokes, the critical moments of daily chaos, and save us\r\nfrom multitudinous nonsense.\r\n\r\nThere are some things which we like to keep out of the\r\nnewspapers,--whose dignity is rather increased by being saved from them.\r\nThere are certain momentary and local interests which have become shy of\r\nthe horn of the reporter. The leading movements in politics, the\r\nadvanced guard of scientific and artistic achievement, the most\r\ninteresting social phenomena rather increase than diminish their\r\nimportance by currency in certain circles instead of in the press. The\r\nprestige of some events in metropolitan cities, a marriage or a party,\r\ndepends on their social repute, and they are ambitiously kept out of\r\nthe journalist's range. Moreover, in politics, a few leading men meet\r\ntogether for consultation, and----but the mysteries of political\r\nstrategy are unknown here. Certainly the journalist has great influence\r\nin them, but the clubs are centres of information and discussions of a\r\ncharacter and interest to which all that newspapers do is second-rate.\r\nScience has never been popularized directly by the newspapers, but the\r\nerudition of a _savant_ reaches to the people by creating an atmospheric\r\nchange, in which task the journals may have their influence. Rightly or\r\nwrongly, the administration in civil affairs at Washington has not\r\nlistened to the press much, but it may be different when a new election\r\napproaches. The social, political, scientific, and military Dii Majores\r\nall depend on the journal for a part of their daily breakfast, but all\r\nsoar above it.\r\n\r\nA well-known and rather startling story describes a being, which seems\r\nto have been neither fish, flesh, nor fowl, which a man made out of the\r\nelements, by the use of his hands, and by the processes of chemistry,\r\nand which at the last galvanic touch rushed forth from the laboratory,\r\nand from the horrified eyes of its creator, an independent, scoffing,\r\nremorseless, and inevitable enemy of him to whose rash ingenuity it owed\r\nits origin.\r\n\r\nSuch a creature symbolizes some of our human arts and initiations. Once\r\norganized by genius and consecrated by precedent, they become mighty\r\nelements in history, revelling amid the wealthy energy of life,\r\nexhausting the forces of the intellect, clipping the tendrils of\r\naffection, becoming colossal in the architecture of society and dorsal\r\nin its traditions, and tyrannizing with the heedless power of an\r\nelement, to the horror of the pious soul which called it into existence,\r\nover all departments of human activity. Such an art, having passed a\r\nperiod of tameless and extravagant dominance, at length becomes a\r\nfossil, and is regarded only as an evidence of social upheaving in a\r\nremote and unaccountable age.\r\n\r\nTo charge such a creature with monstrosity during the period of its\r\npower is simply to expose one's self to popular jeers. Having immense\r\nrespect for majorities in this country, we only venture obscurely to\r\nhint, that, of all arts, none before has ever been so threatening,\r\ncurious, and fascinating a monster as that of printing. We merely\r\nsuggest the hypothesis, novel since some centuries, that old Faustus and\r\nGutenberg were as much inspired by the Evil One as they have been fabled\r\nto be, when they carved out of a mountain of ore the instrument yclept\r\ntype, to completely exhaust the possibilities of which is of late\r\nannounced as the sum of human destiny. They lived under the\r\nhallucination of dawning literature, when printed books implied sacred\r\nand classical perfection; and they could by no means have foreseen the\r\nroyal folios of the \"New York Herald\" and \"Tribune,\" or the marvellous\r\ninanities about the past, present, and future, which figure in an\r\nindescribable list of duodecimo fiction, theology, and popular science.\r\n\r\nBut there is nothing so useless as to protest against a universal\r\nfashion. Every epoch must work out its own problem in its own way; and\r\nit may be that it is appointed unto mankind to work through all possible\r\nmistakes as the condition of finally attaining the truth. The only way\r\nis, to encourage the spirit of every age, to hurry on the climax. The\r\npractical _reductio ad absurdum_ and consequent explosion will soon\r\naccomplish themselves.\r\n\r\nBut a more palpable reason against protesting is, that literature in its\r\ndifferent branches, now as ever, commands the services of the finest\r\nminds. It is the literary character, of which the elder Disraeli has\r\nwritten the natural history, which now as ever creates the books, the\r\nmagazines, the newspapers. That sanctified bookworm was the first to\r\ncodify the laws, customs, habits, and idiosyncrasies of literary men. He\r\nwas the Justinian of the life of genius. He wandered in abstraction\r\nthrough the deserted alcoves of libraries, studying and creating the\r\npolitical economy of thought. What long diversities of character, what\r\nmysterious realms of experience, what wild waywardness of heavenly\r\nendowments, what heroism of inward struggle, what shyness towards\r\nsociety, what devotion to the beckoning ideal of art, what defeats and\r\nwhat triumphs, what sufferings and joys, both in excess, were revealed\r\nby him, the great political economist of genius! In his apostolic view,\r\ngenius alone consecrated literature, and made a literary life sacred.\r\nGenius was to him that peculiar and spontaneous devotion to letters\r\nwhich made its possessor indifferent to everything else. For a man\r\nwithout this heavenly stamp to engage in literature was simply for him\r\nto rush upon his fate, and become a public nuisance. Literature in its\r\nvery nature is precarious, and must be plucked from the brink of fate,\r\nfrom the mouth of the dragon. The literary man runs the risk of being\r\ndestroyed in a thousand ways. He has no track laid, no instituted aids,\r\nno specified course of action. The machineries of life are not for him.\r\nHe enters into no one of the departments of human routine. He has no\r\nrelations with the course of the dull world; he is not quite a man, as\r\nthe world goes, and not at all an angel, as the celestials see. He must\r\nbe his own motive, path, and guide, his own priest, king, and law. The\r\nworld may be his footstool, and may be his slough of despond, but is\r\nnever his final end. His aims are transcendental, his realm is art, his\r\ninterests ideal, his life divine, his destiny immortal. All the old\r\ntheories of saintship are revived in him. He is in the world, but not of\r\nit. Shadows of infinitude are his realities. He sees only the starry\r\nuniverse, and the radiant depths of the soul. Martyrdom may desolate,\r\nbut cannot terrify him. If he be a genius, if his soul crave only his\r\nidea, and his body fare unconsciously well on bread and water, then his\r\nlot is happy, and fortune can present no ills which will not shrink\r\nbefore his burning eye. But if he be less than this, he is lost, the\r\nsport of devouring elements. As he fights fate on the border of ruin, so\r\nmuch the more should he be animated by courage, ambition, pride,\r\npurpose, and faith. To him literature is a high adventure, and\r\nimpossible as a profession. A profession is an instituted department of\r\naction, resting upon universal and constant needs, and paying regular\r\ndividends. But the fine arts must in their nature be lawless.\r\nAppointments cannot be made for them any more than for the\r\nthunder-storms which sweep the sky. They die when they cease to be wild.\r\nLiterary life, at its best, is a desperate play, but it is with guineas,\r\nand not with coppers, to all who truly play it. Its elements would not\r\nbe finer, were they the golden and potent stars of alchemistic and\r\nastrological dreams.\r\n\r\nSuch was genius, and such was literature, in the representation of their\r\nfirst great lawgiver. But the world has changed. The sad story of the\r\ncalamities of authors need not be repeated. We live in the age of\r\nauthors triumphant. By swiftly succeeding and countless publications\r\nthey occupy the eye of the world, and achieve happiness before their\r\ndeath. The stratagems of literature mark no longer a struggle between\r\ngenius and the bailiffs. What was once a desperate venture is now a\r\nlucrative business. What was once a martyrdom is now its own reward.\r\nWhat once had saintly unearthliness is now a powerful motor among\r\nworldly interests. What was once the fatality of genius is now the\r\naspiration of fools. The people have turned to reading, and have become\r\na more liberal patron than even the Athenian State, monastic order, or\r\nnoble lord. No longer does the literary class wander about the streets,\r\ngingerbread in its coat-pockets, and rhymes written on scraps of paper\r\nfrom the gutter in its waistcoat-pockets. No longer does it unequally\r\ncompete with clowns and jockeys for lordly recognition. No longer are\r\nthe poet and the fool court-rivals. No longer does it look forward to\r\nthe jail as an occasional natural resting-place and paradise. No longer\r\nmust the author renounce the rank and robe of a gentleman to fall from\r\nairy regions far below the mechanical artists to the level of\r\nclodhoppers, even whose leaden existence was a less precarious matter.\r\nThe order of scholars has ceased to be mendicant, vagabond, and eremite.\r\nIt no longer cultivates blossoms of the soul, but manufactures objects\r\nof barter. Now is the happy literary epoch, when to be intellectual and\r\nomniscient is the public and private duty of every man. To read\r\nnewspapers by the billion and books by the million is now the common\r\nlaw. We can conceive of Disraeli moaning that the Titan interests of the\r\nearth have overthrown the celestial hierarchy,--that the realm of genius\r\nhas been stormed by worldly workers,--that literature, like the angels,\r\nhas fallen from its first estate,--and that authors, no longer the\r\ndisinterested and suffering apostles, of art, have chosen rather to bear\r\nthe wand of power and luxury than to be inspired. We can imagine his\r\nhorror at the sacrilegious vulgarization of print, that people without\r\ntaste rush into angelic metre, that dunces and sages thrive together on\r\nthe public indiscrimination. How would he marvel to see literary\r\nreputations born, grow old, and die within a season, the owners thereof\r\ncontent to be damned or forgotten eternally for a moment's incense or an\r\nequally fugitive shilling. Nectar and ambrosia mean to them only\r\nmeanness, larceny, sacrilege, and bread and butter.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, notwithstanding the imaginary reproaches of our great literary\r\nchurch-father, the most preciously endowed minds are still toiling in\r\nletters. The sad and tortured devotion of genius still works itself out\r\nin them. Writing is now a marvellous craft and industry. The books which\r\nlast, the books of a season, the quarterlies, monthlies, weeklies,\r\ndailies, and even the hourlies, are among the institutions of its\r\nfostering. Nor should that vehicle, partly of intelligence, but chiefly\r\nof sentiment, the postal system, be unmentioned, which men and women\r\nboth patronize, each after their kind. Altogether, perhaps, in some way\r\nor other, seven-eighths of the life of man is taken up by the Cadmean\r\nArt. The whole fair domain of learning belongs to it; for nowhere now,\r\nin garden, grove, or Stoical Porch, with only the living voices of man\r\nand Nature, do students acquaint themselves with the joyous solemnities,\r\nthe mysterious certainties of thought. The mind lives in a universe of\r\ntype. There is no other art in which so desperate adventures are made.\r\nIndeed, the normal mental state of the abundant writer is a marvellous\r\nphenomenon. The literary faculty is born of the marriage of chronic\r\ndesperation with chronic trust. This may account in part for that\r\npeculiar condition of mind which is both engendered and required by\r\nabundant writing. A bold abandon, a desperate guidance, a thoughtless\r\nratiocination, a mechanical swaying of rhetoric, are the grounds of\r\ndissertation. A pause for a few days, a visit to the country, anything\r\nthat would seem designed to restore the mind to its normal state,\r\ndestroys the faculty. The weary penman, who wishes his chaotic head\r\ncould be relieved by being transformed even as by Puck, knows that very\r\nwhirling chaos is the condition of his multitudinous periods. It seems\r\nas if some special sluices of the soul must be opened to force the pen.\r\nOne man, on returning to his desk from a four weeks' vacation, took up\r\nan unfinished article which he had left, and marvelled that such writing\r\nshould ever have proceeded from him. He could hardly understand it,\r\nstill less could he conceive of the mental process by which he had once\r\ncreated it. That process was a sort of madness, and the discipline of\r\nnewspapers is inflicting it alike upon writers and readers.\r\nDemoralization is the result of a life-long devotion to the maddening\r\nrumors of the day. It takes many a day to recall that fierce caprice, as\r\nof an Oriental despot, with which he watches the tiger-fights of ideas,\r\nand strikes off periods, as the tyrant strikes off heads.\r\n\r\nAnd while no other art commands so universal homage, no other is so\r\npurely artificial, so absolutely unsymbolical. The untutored mind sees\r\nnothing in a printed column. A library has no natural impressiveness. It\r\nis not in the shape of anything in this world of infinite beauty. The\r\nbarbarians of Omri destroyed one without a qualm. They have occupied\r\napartments in seraglios, but the beauties have never feared them as\r\nrivals. Of all human employments, writing is the farthest removed from\r\nany touch of Nature. It is at most a symbolism twice dead and buried.\r\nThe poetry in it lies back of a double hypothesis. Supposing the\r\noriginal sounds to have once been imitations of the voices of Nature,\r\nthose sounds have now run completely away from what they once\r\nrepresented; and supposing that letters were once imitations of natural\r\nsigns, they have long since lost the resemblance, and have become\r\nindependent entities. Whatever else is done by human artifice has in it\r\nsome relic of Nature, some touch of life. Painting copies to the eye,\r\nmusic charms the ear, and all the useful arts have something of the\r\naboriginal way of doing things about them. Even speech has a living\r\ngrace and power, by the play of the voice and eye, and by the billowy\r\nflushes of the countenance. Mental energy culminates in its modulations,\r\nwhile the finest physical features combine to make them a consummate\r\nwork of art. But all the musical, ocular, and facial beauties are absent\r\nfrom writing. The savage knows, or could quickly guess, the use of the\r\nbrush or chisel, the shuttle or locomotive, but not of the pen. Writing\r\nis the only dead art, the only institute of either gods or men so\r\nartificial that the natural mind can discover nothing significant in it.\r\n\r\nFor instance, take one of the disputed statements of the Nicene Creed,\r\nexamine it by the nicest powers of the senses, study it upwards,\r\ndownwards, and crosswise, experiment to learn if it has any mysterious\r\nchemical forces in it, consider its figures in relation to any\r\nastrological positions, to any natural signs of whirlwinds, tempests,\r\nplagues, famine, or earthquakes, try long to discover some hidden\r\nsymbolism in it, and confess finally that no man unregenerate to\r\nletters, by any _a priori_ or empirical knowledge, could have at all\r\nsuspected that a bit of dirty parchment, with an ecclesiastical scrawl\r\nupon it, would have power to drive the currents of history, inspire\r\ngreat national passions, and impel the wars and direct the ideas of an\r\nepoch. The conflicts of the iconoclasts can be understood even by a\r\nchild in its first meditations over a picture-book; hieroglyphics may\r\nrepresent or suggest their objects by some natural association; but the\r\nliterary scrawl has a meaning only to the initiated. A book is the\r\nprince of witch-work. Everything is contained in it; but even a superior\r\nintelligence would have to go to school to get the key to its mysterious\r\ntreasures.\r\n\r\nAnd as the art is thus removed from Nature, so its devotees withdraw\r\nthemselves from life. Of no other class so truly as of writers can it be\r\nsaid that they sacrifice the real to the ideal, life to fame. They\r\nconquer the world by renouncing it. Its fleeting pleasures, its\r\nenchantment of business or listlessness, its social enjoyments, the\r\nvexations and health-giving bliss of domestic life, and all wandering\r\ntastes, must be forsaken. A power which pierces, and an ambition which\r\nenjoys the future, accepts the martyrdom of the present. They feel\r\nloneliness in their own age, while with universal survey viewing the\r\nbeacon-lights of history across the peaks of generations. Their seat of\r\nlife is the literary faculty, and they prune and torture themselves only\r\nto maintain in this the highest intensity and capacity. They are in some\r\nsort rebels battling against time, not the humble well-doer content\r\nsimply to live and bless God. Between them and living men there is the\r\ndifference which exists between analytical and geometrical mathematics:\r\nthe former has to do with signs, the latter with realities. The former\r\ncontains the laws of the physical world, but a man may know and use\r\nthem like an adept, and yet be ignorant of physics. He may know all\r\nthere is of algebra, without seeing that the universe is masked in it.\r\nThe signs would be not means, but ultimates to it. So a writer may never\r\npenetrate through the veil of language to the realities behind,--may\r\nknow only the mechanism, and not the spirit of learning and literature.\r\nHis mind is then skeleton-like,--his thought is the shadow of a shade.\r\n\r\nAnd yet is not life greater than art? Why transform real ideas and\r\nsentiments into typographical fossils? Why have we forgotten the theory\r\nof human life as a divine vegetation? Why not make our hearts the focus\r\nof the lights which we strive to catch in books? Why should the wealthy\r\npassivity of the Oriental genius be so little known among us? Why\r\nconceive of success only as an outward fruit plucked by conscious\r\nstruggle? Banish books, banish reading, and how much time and strength\r\nwould be improvised in which to benefit each other! We might become\r\nourselves embodiments of all the truth and beauty and goodness now\r\nstagnant in libraries, and might spread their aroma through the social\r\natmosphere. The dynamics would supplant the mechanics of the soul. In\r\nthe volume of life the literary man knows only the indexes; but he would\r\nthen be introduced to the radiant, fragrant, and buoyant contents, to\r\nthe beauty and the mystery, to the great passions and long\r\ncontemplations. The eternal spicy breeze would transform the leaden\r\natmosphere of his thought. An outlaw of the universe for his sins, he\r\nwould then be restored to the realities of the heart and mind. He would\r\nthen for the first time discover the difference between skill and\r\nknowledge. Readers and writers would then be succeeded by human beings.\r\nThe golden ante-Cadmean age would come again. Literary sanctity having\r\nbecome a tradition, there would be an end of its pretentious\r\ncounterfeits. The alphabet, decrepit with its long and vast labors,\r\nwould at last be released. The whole army of writers would take their\r\nplace among the curiosities of history. The Alexandrian thaumaturgists,\r\nthe Byzantine historians, the scholastic dialecticians, the serial\r\nnovelists, and the daily dissertationists, strung together, would make a\r\nglittering chain of monomaniacs. Social life is a mutual joy; reading\r\nmay be rarely indulged without danger to sanity; but writing, unless the\r\nman have genius, is but creating new rubbish, the nucleus of new deltas\r\nof obstruction, till the river of life shall lose its way to the ocean,\r\nand the Infinite be shut out altogether. The old bibliopole De Bury\r\nflattered himself that he admired wisdom because it purchaseth such vast\r\ndelight. He had in mind the luxury of reading, and did not think that in\r\nthis world wisdom always hides its head or goes to the stake. Even if\r\nliterature were not to be abolished altogether, it is safe to think that\r\nthe world would be better off, if there were less writing. There should\r\nbe a division of labor; some should read and write, as some ordain laws,\r\ncreate philosophies, tend shops, make chairs,--but why should everybody\r\ndabble with literature?\r\n\r\nIn all hypotheses as to the more remote destiny of literature, we can\r\nbut be struck by the precariousness of its existence. It is art\r\nimperishable and ever-changing material. A fire once extinguished\r\nperhaps half the world's literature, and struck thousands from the list\r\nof authors. The forgetfulness of mankind in the mysterious mediæval age;\r\ndiminished by more than half the world of books. There are many books\r\nwhich surely, and either rapidly or slowly, resolve themselves into the\r\nelements, but the process cannot be seen. A whole army of books perishes\r\nwith every revolution of taste. And yet the amount of current writing\r\nsurpasses the strength of man's intellect or the length of his years.\r\nSurely, the press is very much of a nuisance as well as a blessing. Its\r\nproducts are getting very much in the way, and the impulse of the world\r\nis too strong to allow itself to be clogged by them. Something must be\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nAmong possibilities, let the following be suggested. The world may\r\nperhaps return from unsymbolical to symbolical writing. There is a\r\nscience older than anything but shadowy traditions, and immemorially\r\nlinked with religion, poetry, and art. It is the almost forgotten\r\nscience of symbolism. Symbols, as compared with letters, are a higher\r\nand more potent style of expression. They are the earthly shadows of\r\neternal truth. It is the language of the fine arts, of painting,\r\nsculpture, the stage,--it will be the language of life, when, rising in\r\nthe scale of being, we shall return from the dead sea of literature to\r\nthe more energetic algebra of symbolical meanings. In these, the forms\r\nof the reason and of Nature come into visible harmony; the hopes of man\r\nfind their shadows in the struggles of the universe, and the lights of\r\nthe spirit cluster myriad-fold around the objects of Nature. Let\r\nPhoenician language be vivified into the universal poetry of\r\nsymbolism, and thought would then become life, instead of the ghost of\r\nlife. Current literature would give way to a new and true mythology;\r\nauthors and editors would suffer a transformation similar to that of\r\ntype-setters into artists, and of newsboys into connoisseurs; and the\r\nfigures of a noble humanity would fill the public mind, no longer\r\nconfused and degraded by the perpetual vision of leaden and unsuggestive\r\nletters. From that time prose would be extinct, and poetry would be all\r\nin all. History would renew its youth,--would find, after the struggles,\r\nattainments, and developments of its manhood, that there is after all\r\nnothing wiser in thought, no truer law, than the instincts of childhood.\r\n\r\nOr, again: improvements have already been made which promise as an\r\nultimate result to transform the largest library into a miniature for\r\nthe pocket. Stenography may yet reach to a degree that it will be able\r\nto write folios on the thumb-nail, and dispose all the literature of the\r\nworld comfortably in a gentleman's pocket, before he sets out on his\r\nsummer excursion. The contents of vast tomes, bodies of history and of\r\nscience, may be so reduced that the eye can cover them at a glance, and\r\nthe process of reading be as rapid as that of thought The mind, instead\r\nof wearying of slow perusal, would have to spur its lightning to keep\r\npace with the eye. Many books are born of mere vagueness and cloudiness\r\nof thought. All such, when thus compressed into their reality, would go\r\nout in eternal night. There is something overpowering in the conception\r\nof the high pressure to which life in all its departments may some time\r\nbe brought. The mechanism of reading and writing would be slight. The\r\nmental labor of comprehending would be immense. The mind, instead of\r\nbeing subdued, would be spurred, by what it works in. We are now cramped\r\nand checked by the overwhelming amount of linguistic red-tape in which\r\nwe have to operate; but then men, freed from these bonds, the husks of\r\nthought almost all thrown away, would be purer, live faster, do greater,\r\ndie younger. What magnificent physical improvements, we may suppose,\r\nwill then aid the powers of the soul! The old world would then be\r\nsubdued, nevermore to strike a blow at its lithe conqueror, man. The\r\ndepartment of the newspaper, with inconceivable photographic and\r\ntelegraphic resources, may then be extended to the solar or the stellar\r\nsystems, and the turmoils of all creation would be reported at our\r\nbreakfast-tables. Men would rise every morning to take an intelligible\r\naccount of the aspects and the prospects of the universe.\r\n\r\nOr, once more: shall we venture into the speculative domain of the\r\nphilosophy of history, and give the rationale of our times? What is the\r\ndivine mission of the great marvel of our age, namely, its periodical\r\nand fugitive literature? The intellectual and moral world of mankind\r\nreforms itself at the outset of new civilizations, as Nature reforms\r\nitself at every new geological epoch. The first step toward a reform, as\r\ntoward a crystallization, is a solution. There was a solvent period\r\nbetween the unknown Orient and the greatness of Greece, between the\r\nClassic and the Middle Ages,--and now humanity is again solvent, in the\r\ntransition from the traditions which issued out of feudalism to the\r\nnovelty of democratic crystallization. But as the youth of all animals\r\nis prolonged in proportion to their dignity in the scale of being, so is\r\nit with the children of history. Destiny is the longest-lived of all\r\nthings. We are not going to accomplish it all at once. We have got to\r\nfight for it, to endure the newspapers in behalf of it. We are in a\r\nplace where gravitation changing goes the other way. For the first time,\r\nall reigning ideas now find their focus in the popular mind. The giant\r\ntouches the earth to recover his strength. History returns to the\r\npeople. After two thousand years, popular intelligence is again to be\r\nrevived. And under what new conditions? We live in a telescopic,\r\nmicroscopic, telegraphic universe, all the elements of which are brought\r\ntogether under the combined operation of fire and water, as erst, in\r\nprimitive Nature, vulcanic and plutonic forces struggled together in the\r\nface of heaven and hell to form the earth. The long ranges of history\r\nhave left with us one definite idea: it is that of progress, the\r\nintellectual passion of our time. All our science demonstrates it, all\r\nour poetry sings it. Democracy is the last term of political progress.\r\nPopular intelligence and virtue are the conditions of democracy. To\r\nproduce these is the mission of periodical literature. The vast\r\ncomplexities of the world, all knowledge and all purpose, are being\r\nreduced in the crucible of the popular mind to a common product.\r\nKnowledge lives neither in libraries nor in rare minds, but in the\r\ngeneral heart. Great men are already mythical, and great ideas are\r\nadmitted only so far as we, the people, can see something in them. By no\r\ngreat books or long treatises, but by a ceaseless flow of brevities and\r\nrepetitions, is the pulverized thought of the world wrought into the\r\nsoul. It is amazing how many significant passages in history and in\r\nliterature are reproduced in the essays of magazines and the leaders of\r\nnewspapers by allusion and illustration, and by constant iteration\r\nbeaten into the heads of the people. The popular mind is now feeding\r\nupon and deriving tone from the best things that literary commerce can\r\nproduce from the whole world, past and present. There is no finer\r\nexample of the popularization of science than Agassiz addressing the\r\nAmerican people through the columns of a monthly magazine. Of the\r\npopular heart which used to rumble only about once in a century the\r\nnewspapers are now the daily organs. They are creating an organic\r\ngeneral mind, the soil for future grand ideas and institutes. As the\r\nsoul reaches a higher stage in its destiny than ever before, the\r\nscaffolding by which it has risen is to be thrown aside. The quality of\r\nlibraries is to be transferred to the soul. Spiritual life is now to\r\nexert its influence directly, without the mechanism of letters,--is\r\ngoing to exert itself through the social atmosphere,--and all history\r\nand thought are to be perpetuated and to grow, not in books, but in\r\nminds.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, though we thus justify contemporary writing, we can but think,\r\nthat, after long ages of piecemeal and _bon-mot_ literature, we shall at\r\nlength return to serious studies, vast syntheses, great works. The\r\nnebulous world of letters shall be again concentred into stars. The\r\nepoch of the printing-press has run itself nearly through; but a new\r\nepoch and a new art shall arise, by which the achievements and the\r\nsuccession of genius shall be perpetuated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BRIDGE OF CLOUD.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Burn, O evening hearth, and waken\r\n      Pleasant visions, as of old!\r\n    Though the house by winds be shaken,\r\n      Safe I keep this room of gold!\r\n\r\n    Ah, no longer wizard Fancy\r\n      Builds its castles in the air,\r\n    Luring me by necromancy\r\n      Up the never-ending stair!\r\n\r\n    But, instead, it builds me bridges\r\n      Over many a dark ravine,\r\n    Where beneath the gusty ridges\r\n      Cataracts dash and roar unseen.\r\n\r\n    And I cross them, little heeding\r\n      Blast of wind or torrent's roar,\r\n    As I follow the receding\r\n      Footsteps that have gone before.\r\n\r\n    Nought avails the imploring gesture,\r\n      Nought avails the cry of pain!\r\n    When I touch the flying vesture,\r\n      'Tis the gray robe of the rain.\r\n\r\n    Baffled I return, and, leaning\r\n      O'er the parapets of cloud,\r\n    Watch the mist that intervening\r\n      Wraps the valley in its shroud.\r\n\r\n    And the sounds of life ascending\r\n      Faintly, vaguely, meet the ear,\r\n    Murmur of bells and voices blending\r\n      With the rush of waters near.\r\n\r\n    Well I know what there lies hidden,\r\n      Every tower and town and farm,\r\n    And again the land forbidden\r\n      Reassumes its vanished charm.\r\n\r\n    Well I know the secret places,\r\n      And the nests in hedge and tree;\r\n    At what doors are friendly faces,\r\n      In what hearts a thought of me.\r\n\r\n    Through the mist and darkness sinking,\r\n      Blown by wind and beaten by shower,\r\n    Down I fling the thought I'm thinking,\r\n      Down I toss this Alpine flower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ELECTRIC GIRL OF LA PERRIÈRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nEighteen years ago there occurred in one of the provinces of\r\nFrance a case of an abnormal character, marked by extraordinary\r\nphenomena,--interesting to the scientific, and especially to the medical\r\nworld. The authentic documents in this case are rare; and though the\r\ncase itself is often alluded to, its details have never, so far as I\r\nknow, been reproduced from these documents in an English dress, or\r\npresented in trustworthy form to the American public. It occurred in the\r\nCommune of La Perrière, situated in the Department of Orne, in January,\r\n1846.\r\n\r\nIt was critically observed, at the time, by Dr. Verger, an intelligent\r\nphysician of Bellesme, a neighboring town. He details the result of his\r\nobservations in two letters addressed to the \"Journal du\r\nMagnétisme,\"--one dated January 29, the other February 2, 1846.[1] The\r\neditor of that journal, M. Hébert, (de Garny,) himself repaired to the\r\nspot, made the most minute researches into the matter, and gives us the\r\nresult of his observations and inquiries in a report, also published in\r\nthe \"Journal du Magnétisme.\"[2] A neighboring proprietor, M. Jules de\r\nFarémont, followed up the case with care, from its very commencement,\r\nand has left on record a detailed report of his observations.[3]\r\nFinally, after the girl's arrival in Paris, Dr. Tanchon carefully\r\nstudied the phenomena, and has given the results in a pamphlet published\r\nat the time.[4] He it was, also, who addressed to M. Arago a note on the\r\nsubject, which was laid before the Academy by that distinguished man, at\r\ntheir session of February 16, 1846.[5] Arago himself had then seen the\r\ngirl only a few minutes, but even in that brief time had verified a\r\nportion of the phenomena.\r\n\r\nDr. Tanchon's pamphlet contains fourteen letters, chiefly from medical\r\nmen and persons holding official positions in Bellesme, Mortagne, and\r\nother neighboring towns, given at length and signed by the writers, all\r\nof whom examined the girl, while yet in the country. Their testimony is\r\nso circumstantial, so strictly concurrent in regard to all the main\r\nphenomena, and so clearly indicative of the care and discrimination with\r\nwhich the various observations were made, that there seems no good\r\nreason, unless we find such in the nature of the phenomena themselves,\r\nfor refusing to give it credence. Several of the writers expressly\r\naffirm the accuracy of M. Hébert's narrative, and all of them, by the\r\ndetails they furnish, corroborate it. Mainly from that narrative, aided\r\nby some of the observations of M. de Farémont, I compile the following\r\nbrief statement of the chief facts in this remarkable case.\r\n\r\nAngélique Cottin, a peasant-girl fourteen years of age, robust and in\r\ngood health, but very imperfectly educated and of limited intelligence,\r\nlived with her aunt, the widow Loisnard, in a cottage with an earthen\r\nfloor, close to the Château of Monti-Mer, inhabited by its proprietor,\r\nalready mentioned, M. de Farémont.\r\n\r\nThe weather, for eight days previous to the fifteenth of January, 1846,\r\nhad been heavy and tempestuous, with constantly recurring storms of\r\nthunder and lightning. The atmosphere was charged with electricity.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of that fifteenth of January, at eight o'clock, while\r\nAngélique, in company with three other young girls, was at work, as\r\nusual, in her aunt's cottage, weaving ladies' silk-net gloves, the\r\nframe, made of rough oak and weighing about twenty-five pounds, to\r\nwhich was attached the end of the warp, was upset, and the candlestick\r\non it thrown to the ground. The girls, blaming each other as having\r\ncaused the accident, replaced the frame, relighted the candle, and went\r\nto work again. A second time the frame was thrown down. Thereupon the\r\nchildren ran away, afraid of a thing so strange, and, with the\r\nsuperstition common to their class, dreaming of witchcraft. The\r\nneighbors, attracted by their cries, refused to credit their story. So,\r\nreturning, but with fear and trembling, two of them at first, afterwards\r\na third, resumed their occupation, without the recurrence of the\r\nalarming phenomenon. But as soon as the girl Cottin, imitating her\r\ncompanions, had touched her warp, the frame was agitated again, moved\r\nabout, was upset, and then thrown violently back. The girl was drawn\r\nirresistibly after it; but as soon as she touched it, it moved still\r\nfarther away.\r\n\r\nUpon this the aunt, thinking, like the children, that there must be\r\nsorcery in the case, took her niece to the parsonage of La Perrière,\r\ndemanding exorcism. The curate, an enlightened man, at first laughed at\r\nher story; but the girl had brought her glove with her, and fixing it to\r\na kitchen-chair, the chair, like the frame, was repulsed and upset,\r\nwithout being touched by Angélique. The curate then sat down on the\r\nchair; but both chair and he were thrown to the ground in like manner.\r\nThus practically convinced of the reality of a phenomenon which he could\r\nnot explain, the good man reassured the terrified aunt by telling her it\r\nwas some bodily disease, and, very sensibly, referred the matter to the\r\nphysicians.\r\n\r\nThe next day the aunt related the above particulars to M. de Farémont;\r\nbut for the time the effects had ceased. Three days later, at nine\r\no'clock, that gentleman was summoned to the cottage, where he verified\r\nthe fact that the frame was at intervals thrown back from Angélique with\r\nsuch force, that, when exerting his utmost strength and holding it with\r\nboth hands, he was unable to prevent its motion. He observed that the\r\nmotion was partly rotary, from left to right. He particularly noticed\r\nthat the girl's feet did not touch the frame, and that, when it was\r\nrepulsed, she seemed drawn irresistibly after it, stretching out her\r\nhands, as if instinctively, towards it. It was afterwards remarked,\r\nthat, when a piece of furniture or other object, thus acted upon by\r\nAngélique, was too heavy to be moved, she herself was thrown back, as if\r\nby the reaction of the force upon her person.\r\n\r\nBy this time the cry of witchcraft was raised in the neighborhood, and\r\npublic opinion had even designated by name the sorcerer who had cast the\r\nspell. On the twenty-first of January the phenomena increased in\r\nviolence and in variety. A chair on which the girl attempted to sit\r\ndown, though held by three strong men, was thrown off, in spite of their\r\nefforts, to several yards' distance. Shovels, tongs, lighted firewood,\r\nbrushes, books, were all set in motion when the girl approached them. A\r\npair of scissors fastened to her girdle was detached, and thrown into\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-fourth of January, M. de Farémont took the child and her\r\naunt in his carriage to the small neighboring town of Mamers. There,\r\nbefore two physicians and several ladies and gentlemen, articles of\r\nfurniture moved about on her approach. And there, also, the following\r\nconclusive experiment was tried by M. de Farémont.\r\n\r\nInto one end of a ponderous wooden block, weighing upwards of a hundred\r\nand fifty pounds, he caused a small hook to be driven. To this he made\r\nAngélique fix her silk. As soon as she sat down and her frock touched\r\nthe block, the latter _was instantly raised three or four inches from\r\nthe ground; and this was repeated as much as forty times in a minute_.\r\nThen, after suffering the girl to rest, M. de Farémont seated himself on\r\nthe block, and was elevated in the same way. Then _three men placed\r\nthemselves upon it, and were raised also_, only not quite so high. \"It\r\nis certain,\" says M. de Farémont, \"that I and one of the most athletic\r\nporters of the Halle could not have lifted that block with the three\r\npersons seated on it.\"[6]\r\n\r\nDr. Verger came to Mamers to see Angélique, whom, as well as her family,\r\nhe had previously known. On the twenty-eighth of January, in the\r\npresence of the curate of Saint Martin and of the chaplain of the\r\nBellesme hospital, the following incident occurred. As the child could\r\nnot sew without pricking herself with the needle, nor use scissors\r\nwithout wounding her hands, they set her to shelling peas, placing a\r\nlarge basket before her. As soon as her dress touched the basket, and\r\nshe reached her hand to begin work, the basket was violently repulsed,\r\nand the peas projected upwards and scattered over the room. This was\r\ntwice repeated, under the same circumstances. Dr. Lemonnier, of Saint\r\nMaurice, testifies to the same phenomenon, as occurring in his presence\r\nand in that of the Procurator Royal of Mortagne;[7] he noticed that the\r\nleft hand produced the greater effect. He adds, that, he and another,\r\ngentleman having endeavored, with all their strength, to hold a chair on\r\nwhich Angélique sat down, it was violently forced from them, and one of\r\nits legs broken.\r\n\r\nOn the thirtieth of January, M. de Farémont tried the effect of\r\nisolation. When, by means of dry glass, he isolated the child's feet and\r\nthe chair on which she sat, the chair ceased to move, and she remained\r\nperfectly quiet. M. Olivier, government engineer, tried a similar\r\nexperiment, with the same results.[8] A week later, M. Hébert, repeating\r\nthis experiment, discovered that isolation of the chair was unnecessary;\r\nit sufficed to isolate the girl.[9] Dr. Beaumont, vicar of\r\nPin-la-Garenne, noticed a fact, insignificant in appearance, yet quite\r\nas conclusive as were the more violent manifestations, as to the reality\r\nof the phenomena. Having moistened with saliva the scattered hairs on\r\nhis own arm, so that they lay flattened, attached to the epidermis, when\r\nhe approached his arm to the left arm of the girl, the hairs instantly\r\nerected themselves. M. Hébert repeated the same experiment several\r\ntimes, always with a similar result.[10]\r\n\r\nM. Olivier also tried the following. With a stick of sealing-wax, which\r\nhe had subjected to friction, he touched the girl's arm, and it gave her\r\na considerable shock; but touching her with another similar stick, that\r\nhad not been rubbed, she experienced no effect whatever.[11] Yet when M.\r\nde Farémont, on the nineteenth of January, tried the same experiment\r\nwith a stick of sealing-wax and a glass tube, well prepared by rubbing,\r\nhe obtained no effect whatever. So also a pendulum of light pith,\r\nbrought into close proximity to her person at various points, was\r\nneither attracted nor repulsed, in the slightest degree.[12]\r\n\r\nTowards the beginning of February, Angélique was obliged, for several\r\ndays, to eat standing; she could not sit down on a chair. This fact Dr.\r\nVerger repeatedly verified. Holding her by the arm to prevent accident,\r\nthe moment she touched the chair it was projected from under her, and\r\nshe would have fallen but for his support. At such times, to take rest,\r\nshe had to seat herself on the floor, or on a stone provided for the\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nOn one such occasion, \"she approached,\" says M. de Farémont, \"one of\r\nthose rough, heavy bedsteads used by the peasantry, weighing, with the\r\ncoarse bedclothes, some three hundred pounds, and sought to lie down on\r\nit. The bed shook and oscillated in an incredible manner; no force that\r\nI know of is capable of communicating to it such a movement. Then she\r\nwent to another bed, which was raised from the ground on wooden rollers,\r\nsix inches in diameter; and it was immediately thrown off the rollers.\"\r\nAll this M. de Farémont personally witnessed.[13]\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the second of February, Dr. Verger received Angélique\r\ninto his house. On that day and the next, upwards of one thousand\r\npersons came to see her. The constant experiments, which on that\r\noccasion were continued into the night, so fatigued the poor girl that\r\nthe effects were sensibly diminished. Yet even then a small table\r\nbrought near to her was thrown down so violently that it broke to\r\npieces. It was of cherry-wood and varnished.\r\n\r\n\"In a general way,\" says Dr. Beaumont-Chardon, \"I think the effects were\r\nmore marked with me than with others, because I never evinced suspicion,\r\nand spared her all suffering; and I thought I could observe, that,\r\nalthough her powers were not under the control of her will, yet they\r\nwere greatest when her mind was at ease, and she was in good\r\nspirits.\"[14] It appeared, also, that on waxed, or even tiled floors,\r\nbut more especially on carpets, the effects were much less than on an\r\nearthen floor like that of the cottage where they originally showed\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nAt first wooden furniture seemed exclusively affected; but at a later\r\nperiod metal also, as tongs and shovels, though in a less degree,\r\nappeared to be subjected to this extraordinary influence. When the\r\nchild's powers were the most active, actual contact was not necessary.\r\nArticles of furniture and other small objects moved, if she accidentally\r\napproached them.\r\n\r\nUp to the sixth of February she had been visited by more than two\r\nthousand persons, including distinguished physicians from the towns of\r\nBellesme and Mortagne, and from all the neighborhood, magistrates,\r\nlawyers, ecclesiastics, and others. Some gave her money.\r\n\r\nThen, in an evil hour, listening to mercenary suggestion, the parents\r\nconceived the idea that the poor girl might be made a source of\r\npecuniary gain; and notwithstanding the advice and remonstrance of her\r\ntrue friends, M. de Farémont, Dr. Verger, M. Hébert, and others, her\r\nfather resolved to exhibit her in Paris and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nOn the road they were occasionally subjected to serious annoyances. The\r\nreport of the marvels above narrated had spread far and wide; and the\r\npopulace, by hundreds, followed the carriage, hooting and abusing the\r\nsorceress.\r\n\r\nArrived at the French metropolis, they put up at the Hôtel de Rennes,\r\nNo. 23, Rue des Deux-Écus. There, on the evening of the twelfth of\r\nFebruary, Dr. Tanchon saw Angélique for the first time.\r\n\r\nThis gentleman soon verified, among other phenomena, the following. A\r\nchair, which he held firmly with both hands, was forced back as soon as\r\nshe attempted to sit down; a middle-sized dining-table was displaced and\r\nrepulsed by the touch of her dress; a large sofa, on which Dr. Tanchon\r\nwas sitting, was pushed violently to the wall, as soon as the child sat\r\ndown beside him. The Doctor remarked, that, when a chair was thrown back\r\nfrom under her, her clothes seemed attracted by it, and adhered to it,\r\nuntil it was repulsed beyond their reach; that the power was greater\r\nfrom the left hand than from the right, and that the former was warmer\r\nthan the latter, and often trembled, agitated by unusual contractions;\r\nthat the influence emanating from the girl was intermittent, not\r\npermanent, being usually most powerful from seven till nine o'clock in\r\nthe evening, possibly influenced by the principal meal of the day,\r\ndinner, taken at six o'clock; that, if the girl was cut off from contact\r\nwith the earth, either by placing her feet on a non-conductor or merely\r\nby keeping them raised from the ground, the power ceased, and she could\r\nremain seated quietly; that, during the paroxysm, if her left hand\r\ntouched any object, she threw it from her as if it burned her,\r\ncomplaining that it pricked her, especially on the wrist; that,\r\nhappening one day to touch accidentally the nape of her neck, the girl\r\nran from him, crying out with pain; and that repeated observation\r\nassured him of the fact that there was, in the region of the\r\ncerebellum, and at the point where the superior muscles of the neck are\r\ninserted in the cranium, a point so acutely sensitive that the child\r\nwould not suffer there the lightest touch; and, finally, that the girl's\r\npulse, often irregular, usually varied from one hundred and five to one\r\nhundred and twenty beats a minute.\r\n\r\nA curious observation made by this physician was, that, at the moment of\r\ngreatest action, a cool breeze, or gaseous current, seemed to flow from\r\nher person. This he felt on his hand, as distinctly as one feels the\r\nbreath during an ordinary expiration.[15]\r\n\r\nHe remarked, also, that the intermittence of the child's power seemed to\r\ndepend in a measure on her state of mind. She was often in fear lest\r\nsome one should touch her from behind; the phenomena themselves agitated\r\nher; in spite of a month's experience, each time they occurred she drew\r\nback, as if alarmed. And all such agitations seemed to diminish her\r\npower. When she was careless, and her mind was diverted to something\r\nelse, the demonstrations were always the most energetic.\r\n\r\nFrom the north pole of a magnet, if it touched her finger, she received\r\na sharp shock; while the contact of the south pole produced upon her no\r\neffect whatever. This effect was uniform; and the girl could always tell\r\nwhich pole touched her.\r\n\r\nDr. Tanchon ascertained from the mother that no indications of puberty\r\nhad yet manifested themselves in her daughter's case.\r\n\r\nSuch is a summary of the facts, embodied in a report drawn up by Dr.\r\nTanchon on the fifteenth of February. He took it with him on the evening\r\nof the sixteenth to the Academy of Sciences, and asked M. Arago if he\r\nhad seen the electric girl, and if he intended to bring her case that\r\nevening to the notice of the Academy. Arago replied to both questions in\r\nthe affirmative, adding,--\"If you have seen her, I shall receive from\r\nyou with pleasure any communication you may have to make.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Tanchon then read to him the report; and at the session of that\r\nevening, Arago presented it, stated what he himself had seen, and\r\nproposed that a committee should be appointed to examine the case. His\r\nstatement was received by his audience with many expressions of\r\nincredulity; but they acceded to his suggestion by naming, from the\r\nmembers of the Academy, a committee of six.\r\n\r\nIt appears that Arago had had but a single opportunity, and for the\r\nbrief space of less than half an hour, of witnessing the phenomena to\r\nwhich he referred. M. Cholet, the speculator who advanced to her parents\r\nthe money necessary to bring Angélique to Paris, had taken the girl and\r\nher parents to the Observatory, where Arago then was, who, at the\r\nearnest instance of Cholet, agreed to test the child's powers at once.\r\nThere were present on this occasion, besides Arago, MM. Mathieu and\r\nLaugier, and an astronomer of the Observatory, named M. Goujon.\r\n\r\nThe experiment of the chair perfectly succeeded. It was projected with\r\ngreat violence against the wall, while the girl was thrown on the other\r\nside. This experiment was repeated several times by Arago himself, and\r\neach time with the same result. He could not, with all his force, hinder\r\nthe chair from being thrown back. Then MM. Goujon and Laugier attempted\r\nto hold it, but with as little success. Finally, M. Goujon seated\r\nhimself first on half the chair, and at the moment when Angélique was\r\ntaking her seat beside him the chair was thrown down.\r\n\r\nWhen Angélique approached a small table, at the instant that her apron\r\ntouched it, it was repulsed.\r\n\r\nThese particulars were given in all the medical journals of the day,[16]\r\nas well as in the \"Journal des Débats\" of February 18, and the \"Courrier\r\nFrançais\" of February 19, 1846.\r\n\r\nThe minutes of the session of the Academy touch upon them in the most\r\nstudiously brief and guarded manner. They say, the sitting lasted only\r\nsome minutes. They admit, however, the main fact, namely, that the\r\nmovements of the chair, occurring as soon as Angélique seated herself\r\nupon it, were most violent (\"_d'une extrême violence_\"). But as to the\r\nother experiment, they allege that M. Arago did not clearly perceive the\r\nmovement of the table by the mere intervention of the girl's apron,\r\nthough the other observers did.[17] It is added, that the girl produced\r\nno effect on the magnetic needle.\r\n\r\nSome accounts represent Arago as expressing himself much more decidedly.\r\nHe may have done so, in addressing the Academy; but I find no official\r\nrecord of his remarks.\r\n\r\nHe did not assist at the sittings of the committee that had been\r\nappointed at his suggestion; but he signed their report, having\r\nconfidence, as he declared, in their judgment, and sharing their\r\nmistrust.\r\n\r\nThat report, made on the ninth of March, is to the effect, that they\r\nwitnessed no repulsive agency on a table or similar object; that they\r\nsaw no effect produced by the girl's arm on a magnetic needle; that the\r\ngirl did not possess the power to distinguish between the two poles of a\r\nmagnet; and, finally, that the only result they obtained was sudden and\r\nviolent movements of chairs on which the child was seated. They add,\r\n\"Serious suspicions having arisen as to the manner in which these\r\nmovements were produced, the committee decided to submit them to a\r\nstrict examination, declaring, in plain terms, that they would endeavor\r\nto discover what part certain adroit and concealed manoeuvres of the\r\nhands and feet had in their production. From that moment we were\r\ninformed that the young girl had lost her attractive and repulsive\r\npowers, and that we should be notified when they reappeared. Many days\r\nhave elapsed; no notice has been sent us; yet we learn that Mademoiselle\r\nCottin daily exhibits her experiments in private circles.\" And they\r\nconclude by recommending \"that the communications addressed to them in\r\nher case be considered _as not received_\" (\"_comme non avenues_\"). In a\r\nword, they officially branded the poor girl as an impostor.\r\n\r\nThat, without any inquiry into the antecedents of the patient, without\r\nthe slightest attempt to obtain from those medical men who had followed\r\nup the case from its commencement what they had observed, and that, in\r\nadvance of the strict examination which it was their duty to make, they\r\nshould insult the unfortunate girl by declaring that they intended to\r\nfind out the tricks with which she had been attempting to deceive\r\nthem,--all this is not the less lamentable because it is common among\r\nthose, who sit in the high places of science.\r\n\r\nIf these Academicians had been moved by a simple love of truth, not\r\nurged by a self-complacent eagerness to display their own sagacity, they\r\nmight have found a more probable explanation of the cessation, after\r\ntheir first session, of some of Angelique's chief powers.\r\n\r\nSuch an explanation is furnished to us by Dr. Tanchon, who was present,\r\nby invitation, at the sittings of the committee.\r\n\r\nHe informs us that, at their first sitting, held at the Jardin des\r\nPlantes, on the seventeenth of February, after the committee had\r\nwitnessed, twice repeated, the violent displacement of a chair held with\r\nall his strength by one of their number, (M. Rayet,) instead of\r\nfollowing up similar experiments and patiently waiting to observe the\r\nphenomena as they presented themselves, they proceeded at once to\r\nsatisfy their own preconceptions. They brought Angélique into contact\r\nwith a voltaic battery. Then they placed on the bare arm of the child a\r\ndead frog, anatomically prepared after the manner of Matteucci, that is,\r\nthe skin removed, and the animal dissected so as to expose the lumbar\r\nnerves. By a galvanic current, they caused this frog to move, apparently\r\nto revive, on the girl's arm. The effect upon her may be imagined. The\r\nignorant child, terrified out of her senses, spoke of nothing else the\r\nrest of the day, dreamed of dead frogs coming to life all night, and\r\nbegan to talk eagerly about it again the first thing the next\r\nmorning.[18] From that time her attractive and repulsive powers\r\ngradually declined.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the privilege of much accumulated learning, in addition\r\nto the advantages of varied scientific research, we must have something\r\nelse, if we would advance yet farther in true knowledge. We must be\r\nimbued with a simple, faithful spirit, not presuming, not preoccupied.\r\nWe must be willing to sit down at the feet of Truth, humble, patient,\r\ndocile, single-hearted. We must not be wise in our own conceit; else the\r\nfool's chance is better than ours, to avoid error, and distinguish\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nM. Cohu, a medical man of Mortagne, writing, in March, 1846, in reply to\r\nsome inquiries of Dr. Tanchon, after stating that the phenomenon of the\r\nchair, repeatedly observed by himself, had been witnessed also by more\r\nthan a thousand persons, adds,--\"It matters not what name we may give to\r\nthis; the important point is, to verify the reality of a repulsive\r\nagency, and of one that is distinctly marked; the effects it is\r\nimpossible to deny. We may assign to this agency what seat we please, in\r\nthe cerebellum, in the pelvis, or elsewhere; the _fact_ is material,\r\nvisible, incontestable. Here in the Province, Sir, we are not very\r\nlearned, but we are often very mistrustful. In the present case we have\r\nexamined, reëxamined, taken every possible precaution against deception;\r\nand the more we have seen, the deeper has been our conviction of the\r\nreality of the phenomenon. Let the Academy decide as it will. _We have\r\nseen_; it has not seen. We are, therefore, in a condition to decide\r\nbetter than it can, I do not say what cause was operating, but what\r\neffects presented themselves, under circumstances that remove even the\r\nshadow of a doubt.\"[19]\r\n\r\nM. Hébert, too, states a truth of great practical value, when he\r\nremarks, that, in the examination of phenomena of so fugitive and\r\nseemingly capricious a character, involving the element of vitality, and\r\nthe production of which at any given moment depends not upon us, we\r\n\"ought to accommodate ourselves to the nature of the fact, not insist\r\nthat it should accommodate itself to us.\"\r\n\r\nFor myself, I do not pretend to offer any positive opinion as to what\r\nwas ultimately the real state of the case. I do not assume to determine\r\nwhether the attractive and repulsive phenomena, after continuing for\r\nupwards of a month, happened to be about to cease at the very time the\r\ncommittee began to observe them,--or whether the harsh suspicious and\r\nterror-inspiring tests of these gentlemen so wrought on the nervous\r\nsystem of an easily daunted and superstitious girl, that some of her\r\nabnormal powers, already on the wane, presently disappeared,--or whether\r\nthe poor child, it may be at the instigation of her parents, left\r\nwithout the means of support,[20] really did at last simulate phenomena\r\nthat once were real, manufacture a counterfeit of what was originally\r\ngenuine. I do not take upon myself to decide between these various\r\nhypotheses. I but express my conviction, that, for the first few weeks\r\nat least, the phenomena actually occurred,--and that, had not the\r\ngentlemen of the Academy been very unfortunate or very injudicious,\r\nthey could not have failed to perceive their reality. And I seek in vain\r\nsome apology for the conduct of these learned Academicians, called upon\r\nto deal with a case so fraught with interest to science, when I find\r\nthem, merely because they do not at once succeed in personally verifying\r\nsufficient to convince them of the existence of certain novel phenomena,\r\nnot only neglecting to seek evidence elsewhere, but even rejecting that\r\nwhich a candid observer had placed within their reach.\r\n\r\nThis appears to have been the judgment of the medical public of Paris.\r\nThe \"Gazette des Hôpitaux,\" in its issue of March 17, 1846, protests\r\nagainst the committee's mode of ignoring the matter, declaring that it\r\nsatisfied nobody. \"Not received!\" said the editor (alluding to the words\r\nof the report); \"that would be very convenient, if it were only\r\npossible!\"[21]\r\n\r\nAnd the \"Gazette Médicale\" very justly remarks,--\"The non-appearance of\r\nthe phenomena at such or such a given moment proves nothing in itself.\r\nIt is but a negative fact, and, as such, cannot disprove the positive\r\nfact of their appearance at another moment, if that be otherwise\r\nsatisfactorily attested.\" And the \"Gazette\" goes on to argue, from the\r\nnature of the facts, that it is in the highest degree improbable that\r\nthey should have been the result of premeditated imposture.\r\n\r\nThe course adopted by the Academy's committee is the less defensible,\r\nbecause, though the attractive and repulsive phenomena ceased after\r\ntheir first session, other phenomena, sufficiently remarkable, still\r\ncontinued. As late as the tenth of March, the day after the committee\r\nmade their report, Angélique being then at Dr. Tanchon's house, a table\r\ntouched by her apron, while her hands were behind her and her feet\r\nfifteen inches distant from it, _was raised entirely from the ground_,\r\nthough no part of her body touched it. This was witnessed, besides Dr.\r\nTanchon, by Dr. Charpentier-Méricourt, who had stationed himself so as\r\nto observe it from the side. He distinctly saw the table rise, with all\r\nfour legs, from the floor, and he noticed that the two legs of the table\r\nfarthest from the girl rose first. He declares, that, during the whole\r\ntime, he perceived not the slightest movement either of her hands or her\r\nfeet; and he regarded deception, under the circumstances, to be utterly\r\nimpossible.[22]\r\n\r\nOn the twelfth of March, in presence of five physicians, Drs. Amédée\r\nLatour, Lachaise, Deleau, Pichard, and Soulé, the same phenomenon\r\noccurred twice.\r\n\r\nAnd yet again on the fourteenth, four physicians being present, the\r\ntable was raised a single time, but with startling force. It was of\r\nmahogany, with two drawers, and was four feet long by two feet and a\r\nhalf wide. We may suppose it to have weighed some fifty or sixty pounds;\r\nso that the girl's power, in this particular, appears to have much\r\ndecreased since that day, about the end of January, when M. de Farémont\r\nsaw repeatedly raised from the ground a block of one hundred and fifty\r\npounds' weight, with three men seated on it,--in all, not less than five\r\nto six hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nBy the end of March the whole of the phenomena had almost totally\r\nceased; and it does not appear that they have ever shown themselves\r\nsince that time.\r\n\r\nDr. Tanchon considered them electrical. M. de Farémont seems to have\r\ndoubted that they were strictly so. In a letter, dated Monti-Mer,\r\nNovember 1, 1846, and addressed to the Marquis de Mirville, that\r\ngentleman says,--\"The electrical effects I have seen produced in this\r\ncase varied so much,--since under certain circumstances good conductors\r\noperated, and then again, in others, no effect was observable,--that, if\r\none follows the ordinary laws of electrical phenomena, one finds\r\nevidence both for and against. I am well convinced, that, in the case\r\nof this child, there is some power other than electricity.\"[23]\r\n\r\nBut as my object is to state facts, rather than to moot theories, I\r\nleave this debatable ground to others, and here close a narrative,\r\ncompiled with much care, of this interesting and instructive case. I was\r\nthe rather disposed to examine it critically and report it in detail,\r\nbecause it seems to suggest valuable hints, if it does not afford some\r\nclue, as to the character of subsequent manifestations in the United\r\nStates and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis case is not an isolated one. My limits however, prevent me from\r\nhere reproducing, as I might, sundry other recent narratives more or\r\nless analogous to that of the girl Cottin. To one only shall I briefly\r\nadvert: a case related in the Paris newspaper, the \"Siècle,\" of March 4,\r\n1846, published when all Paris was talking of Arago's statement in\r\nregard to the electric girl.\r\n\r\nIt is there given on the authority of a principal professor in one of\r\nthe Royal Colleges of Paris. The case, very similar to that of Angélique\r\nCottin, occurred in the month of December previous, in the person of a\r\nyoung girl, not quite fourteen years old, apprenticed to a colorist, in\r\nthe Rue Descartes. The occurrences were quite as marked as those in the\r\nCottin case. The professor, seated one day near the girl, was raised\r\nfrom the floor, along with the chair on which he sat. There were\r\noccasional knockings. The phenomena commenced December 2, 1845; and\r\nlasted twelve days.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] _Journal du Magnétisme_, for 1846, pp. 80-84.\r\n\r\n[2] Pp. 89-106.\r\n\r\n[3] In Dr. Tanchon's pamphlet, pp. 46-53.\r\n\r\n[4] _Enquête, sur l'Authenticité des Phénomènes Électriques d'Angélique\r\nCottin_, par le Dr. Tanchon.

When I met him he had just appeared as an author, and his\r\nfriends everywhere declared that Voltaire's mantle had fallen on his\r\nshoulders. He had, like Voltaire, discovered instantly that mankind were\r\ndivided into hammers and anvils, and he determined to be one of the\r\nhammers. He began his career by ridiculing a poetical country, Greece,\r\nwhose guest he had been, and whose sovereign and ministers had received\r\nhim with confidence,--repaying three years of hospitality by a satire of\r\nthree hundred pages. \"Greece and the Greeks\" was translated into several\r\nlanguages. This edifying publication, which put the laughers on his\r\nside, was followed by a different sort of work, which came near\r\nproducing on this budding reputation the effect of an April frost upon\r\nan almond-tree in blossom. Voltaire's heir had found no better mode of\r\nwriting natural and true novels (so the scandalous chronicle said) than\r\nto copy an original correspondence, and indiscreet \"detectives\" of\r\nletters menaced him with publishing the whole Italian work from which he\r\n\"conveyed\" the best part of \"Tolla.\" All the literary world cried,\r\nHavoc! upon the sprightly fellow laden with Italian relics. It was a\r\ncritical moment in his life.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Edmond About was introduced to me by a fascinating lady;--who\r\ncan resist the charms of the other sex? I saw before me a man some\r\neight-and-twenty years old, of a slender figure; his features were\r\nirregular, but intellectual, and he looked at people like an\r\nexcessively near-sighted person who abused the advantages of being\r\nnear-sighted. He wore no spectacles. His eyes were small, cold, bright,\r\nand were well wadded with such thick eyebrows and eyelashes it seemed\r\nthese must absorb them. I subsequently found, in a strange American\r\nbook,[24] some descriptions which may be applied to his odd expression\r\nof eye. Monsieur Edmond About's mouth was sneering and sensual, and even\r\nthen affected Voltaire's sarcastic grimace. His bitter and equivocal\r\nsmile put you in mind of the grinding of an epigram-mill. One could\r\ndetect in his attitude, his physiognomy, and his language, that\r\nobsequious malice, that familiarity, at the same time flattering and\r\njeering, which Voltaire turned to such good account in his commerce with\r\nthe great people of his day, and which his disciple was learning to\r\npractise in his intercourse with the powerful of these times,--the\r\n_parvenus_ and the wealthy. I was struck by the face of this college\r\nMacchiavelli: on it were written the desire of success and the longing\r\nto enjoy; the calculations of the ambitious man were allied with the\r\nmaliciousness of the giddy child. Of course he overwhelmed me with\r\ncompliments and flattery. He had, or thought he had, use for me. I\r\nbenevolently became the defender of the poor calumniated fellow in the\r\n\"Revue des Deux Mondes,\" just as one undertakes out of pure kindness of\r\nheart to protect the widow and the orphan. Monsieur Edmond About thanked\r\nme _orally_ with a flood of extraordinary gratitude; but he took good\r\ncare to avoid writing a word upon the subject. A letter might have laid\r\nhim under engagements, and might have embarrassed him one day or\r\nanother. Whereas he aimed to be both a diplomatist and a literary man.\r\nHe practised the art of good writing, and the art of turning it to the\r\nbest advantage.\r\n\r\nSome months after this he brought out a piece called \"Guillery,\" at the\r\nFrench Comedy. The first night it was played, there was a hail-storm of\r\nhisses. No _claqueur_ ever remembered to have heard the like before. The\r\ncharitable dramatic critics--delicate fellows, who cannot bear to see\r\npeople possess talents without their permission and despite\r\nthem--attacked the piece as blood-hounds the fugitive murderer. It\r\nseemed as if Monsieur Edmond About was a ruined man, who could never\r\ndare hold up his head again. He resisted the death-warrant. He had\r\nfriends in influential houses. He soon found lint enough for his wounds.\r\nThe next winter the town heard that Monsieur Edmond About's wounds had\r\nbeen well dressed and were cured, and that he was going to write in\r\n\"Figaro.\" The amateurs of scandal began at once to reckon upon the\r\ngratification of their tastes. They were not mistaken. The moment his\r\nsecond contribution to \"Figaro\" appeared, it became evident to all that\r\nhe had taken this warlike position at the advanced posts of light\r\nliterature solely to shoot at those persons who had wounded his vanity.\r\nFor three months he kept up such a sharp fire that every week numbered\r\nits dead. Such carnage had never been seen. Everybody was severely\r\nwounded: Jules Janin, Paulin Limayrac, Champfleury, Barbey d'Aurevilly,\r\nand a host of others. Everybody said, (a thrill of terror ran through\r\nthem as they spoke,)--There is going to be one of these mornings a\r\nterrible butchery: that imprudent Edmond About will have at least ten\r\nduels on his hands. Not a bit of it! Not a bit of it! There were\r\nnegotiations, embassies, explanations exchanged which explained nothing,\r\nand reparations made which repaired nothing. But there was not a shot\r\nfired. There was not a drop of blood drawn. O Lord! no! Third parties\r\nintervened, and demonstrated to the offended parties, that, when\r\nMonsieur Edmond About called them stupid boobies, humbugs, tumblers, he\r\nhad no intention whatever of offending them. Good gracious! far\r\notherwise! In fine, one day the farce was played, the curtain fell upon\r\nthe well-spanked critics, and all this little company (so full of\r\ntalents and chivalry!) went arm-in-arm, the insulter and the insulted,\r\nto breakfast together at Monsieur About's rooms, where, between a dozen\r\noysters and a bottle of Sauterne, he asked his victims what they thought\r\nof some Titians he had just discovered, and which he wished to sell to\r\nthe Louvre for a small fortune,--Titians which were not painted even by\r\nMignard. The insulter and the insulted fell into each other's arms\r\nbefore these daubs, and they parted, each delighted with the other.\r\nThese pseudo-Titians were for Monsieur About his Alcibiades's\r\ndog's-tail. He spent one every month. Literary, picturesque, romanesque,\r\nhistorical, agricultural, Greek, and Roman questions were never subjects\r\nto him: he considered them merely advertisements to puff the\r\ntranscendent merits of Edmond About. Before he left \"Figaro\" he\r\ndetermined to show me what a grateful fellow he was. He made me the mark\r\nfor all his epigrams, and I paid the price of peace with the others. I\r\nhave heard, since then, that Monsieur Edmond About has made his way\r\nrapidly in the world. He is rich. He has the ribbon of the Legion of\r\nHonor. He excels in writing pamphlets. He is not afraid of the most\r\nstartling truths. He writes about the Pope like a man who is not afraid\r\nof the spiritual powers, and he has demonstrated that Prince Napoleon\r\nwon the Battle of the Alma and organized Algeria.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous details of my grandeur and my decline, none exhibit\r\nin a clearer light our literary manners and customs than the history of\r\nmy relations with Monsieur Louis Ulbach, the virtuous author, _now_, of\r\n\"L'Homme aux Cinq Louis d'Or,\" \"Suzanne Duchemin,\" \"Monsieur et Madame\r\nFernel,\" and other tales, which he hopes to see crowned by the French\r\nAcademy. Monsieur Louis Ulbach at first belonged to a triumvirate which\r\npretended to stand above the mob of democratic writers; and of a truth\r\nMonsieur Maxime du Camp and Monsieur Laurent Pichat, his two leaders,\r\nhad none of those smoking-_café_ vulgarities which have procured so many\r\nsubscribers to the \"Siècle\" newspaper. Both poets, Laurent Pichat with\r\nremarkable loftiness, Maxime du Camp with _bizarre_ energy, intent upon\r\nan ideal which democracy has a right to pursue, since it has not yet\r\nfound it, men of the world, capable of discussing in full dress the most\r\nperplexed questions of Socialism, they accept none of those party-chains\r\nwhich so often bow down the noblest minds before idols made of plaster\r\nor of clay. Besides, both of them were known by admirable acts of\r\ngenerosity. There were in this triumvirate such dashes of aristocracy\r\nand of revolution that they were called \"the Poles of literature.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, when the storm burst which I had raised by my irreverent\r\nattacks on De Béranger, these gentlemen separated from their political\r\nfriends, and complimented me. One of them even addressed me a letter, in\r\nwhich I read these words, which assuredly I would not have written:\r\n\"That stupid De Béranger.\" There was a sort of alliance between us.\r\nMonsieur Louis Ulbach celebrated it by publishing in his magazine, \"La\r\nRevue de Paris,\" an article in my honor, in which, after the usual\r\nreserves, and after declaring war upon my doctrines, he vowed my prose\r\nto be \"fascinating,\" and complained of being so bewitched as to believe,\r\nat times, that he was converted to the cause of the throne and of the\r\naltar. This epithet, \"fascinating,\" in turn fascinated me; and I thought\r\nthat my prose was, like some serpent, about to fascinate all the\r\nbutcher-birds and ducks of the democratic marsh. A year passed away;\r\nthese fine friendships cooled: 't is the fate of these factitious\r\ntendernesses. With winter my second volume appeared, and Monsieur Louis\r\nUlbach set to work again; but this time he found me merely \"ingenious.\"\r\nIt was a good deal more than I merited, and I would willingly have\r\ncontented myself with this phrase. Unfortunately, I could not forget the\r\naustere counsel of Monsieur Louis Veuillot, and at this very epoch,\r\nMonsieur Louis Ulbach, who as a novelist could merit a great deal of\r\npraise, took it into his head to publish a thick volume of\r\ntranscendental criticism, in which he attacked everything I admired and\r\nlauded everything I detested. I confess that I felt extremely\r\nembarrassed: those nice little words \"fascinating\" and \"ingenious\" stuck\r\nin my mind. Monsieur Louis Ulbach himself extricated me from my\r\nperplexity. I had insufficiently praised his last novel. He wrote a\r\nthird article on my third work. Alas! the honeymoon had set. The\r\n\"fascinating\" prose of 1855, the \"ingenious\" prose of 1856, had become\r\nin 1857, in the opinion of the same judge, and in the language of the\r\nsame pen, \"pretentious and tiresome.\" This sudden change of things and\r\nepithets restored me to liberty. I walked abroad in all my strength and\r\nindependence, and I dissected Monsieur Louis Ulbach's thick volume with\r\na severity which was still tempered by the courteous forms and the\r\ndimensions of my few newspaper-columns. A year passed away. My fourth\r\nwork appeared. Note that these several volumes were not different works,\r\nbut a series of volumes expressing the same opinions in the very same\r\nstyle; in fine, they were but one work. Note, too, that Monsieur\r\nUlbach's \"Revue de Paris\" and \"L'Assemblée Nationale,\" in which I wrote,\r\nwere both suppressed by the government on the same day, which\r\nestablished between us a fraternity of martyrdom. All this was as\r\nnothing. Louis Ulbach, this very same Louis Ulbach, was employed by a\r\nnewspaper where he was sure to please by insulting me, and the very\r\nfirst thing he did was to give me a kick, such a kick as twenty horses\r\ncovered with sleigh-bells could not give. He called me \"ignoramus,\" and\r\nwondered what \"this fellow\" meant by his literary drivelling. The most\r\ncurious part of the whole business is, that he did not write the\r\narticle, all he did was to sign it! Four years, and a scratch given his\r\nvanity, had proved enough to produce this change!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShall I speak to you now of Henry Murger? I wrote this chapter of my\r\nMemoirs during his life. I should have suppressed it, did I feel the\r\nleast drop of bitterness mingled with the recollection of the acts of\r\npetty ingratitude of this charming writer. But my object in writing this\r\nwork is less to satisfy sterile revenge than to exhibit to you a corner\r\nof literary life in Paris in the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nIn 1850 Henry Murger published a book in which the manners and customs\r\nof people who live by their wits were painted in colors scarcely likely\r\nto fascinate healthy imaginations. He declared to the world that the\r\nnovitiate of our future great authors was nothing but one incessant hunt\r\nafter a half-dollar and a mutton-chop. The world was told by others that\r\nHenry Murger had learned to paint this existence by actual experience.\r\nThere were, however, in his book some excellent flashes of fancy and\r\nyouth; besides, the public then had grown tired of interminable\r\nadventures and novels in fifty volumes. So Henry Murger's first work,\r\n\"La Vie de Bohême,\" was very popular; but it did not swell his purse or\r\nimprove his wardrobe. He was introduced to me, and I shall never forget\r\nthe low bow he made me. I was afraid for one moment that his bald head\r\nwould fall between his legs. This precocious baldness gave to his\r\ndelicate and sad face a singular physiognomy. He looked not so much like\r\na young old man as like an old young man. Henry Murger's warmest desire\r\nwas to write in the celebrated and influential \"Revue des Deux Mondes,\"\r\nwhich we all abuse so violently when we have reason to complain of it,\r\nand which has but to make a sign to us and we instantly fall into its\r\narms. I was then on the best terms with the \"Revue des Deux Mondes.\"\r\nMonsieur Castil-Blaze, being from the same neighborhood with me, had\r\nobtained a place for me in the \"Revue,\" which belonged to his\r\nson-in-law, Monsieur Buloz. I promised Henry Murger to speak a good word\r\nfor him. A favorable opportunity of doing so occurred a few days\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know what is to become of us,\" said Monsieur Buloz to me; \"our\r\nold contributors are dying, and no new ones make their appearance.\"\r\n\r\n\"They appear, but you refuse to see them. There is Henry Murger, for\r\ninstance; he has just written an amusing book, which is the most\r\nsuccessful of the season.\"\r\n\r\n\"Henry Murger! And is it you, Count Armand de Pontmartin, the literary\r\nnobleman, the aristocratic writer, who wear (as the world avers) a white\r\ncravat and white kid gloves from the time you get up, (I confess I have\r\nnever seen you with them,)--is it you who propose to me to admit Henry\r\nMurger as a contributor to the 'Revue des Deux Mondes,'--Henry Murger,\r\nthe ringleader of people who live by their wits?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why shouldn't I? We live in a day when white cravats have to be very\r\nrespectful to red cravats. Besides, nothing is too strange to happen;\r\nand I would not bet you that Murger does not write in 'Le Moniteur'\r\nbefore I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you think I had better admit Henry Murger, I consent; but remember\r\nwhat I say to you: It will be the source of annoyance to you.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day a hack bore Henry Murger and me from the corner of the\r\nBoulevard des Italiens and the Rue du Helder to the office of the \"Revue\r\ndes Deux Mondes.\" We talked on the way. If I had had any illusions left\r\nof the poetical dreams and virginal thoughts of young men fevered by\r\nliterary ambition, these few minutes would have been enough to dispel\r\nthem all. Henry Murger thought of nothing upon earth but money. How was\r\nhe going to pay his quarter's rent, or rather his two or three quarters'\r\nrent? for he was two or three quarters behindhand. He still had credit\r\nwith this _restaurateur_, but he owed so much to such another that he\r\ndared not show his face there. He was over head and ears in debt to his\r\ntailor. He was afraid to think of the amount of money he owed his\r\nshoemaker. The list was long, and \"bills payable\" lamentable. To end\r\nthis dreary balance-sheet, I took it into my head to deliver him a\r\nlecture on the morality of literature and the duty of literary men.\r\n\"Art,\" said I to him, \"must escape the materialism which oppresses and\r\nwill at last absorb it. We romantics of 1828 were mistaken. We thought\r\nwe were reacting against the pagan and mummified school of the\r\neighteenth century and of the First Empire. We did not perceive that a\r\nrevolutionary Art can under no circumstances turn to the profit of grand\r\nspiritual and Christian traditions, to the worship of the ideal, to the\r\nelevation of intellects. We did not see that it would be a little sooner\r\nor a little later discounted by literary demagogues, who, without\r\ntradition, without a creed, without any law except their own whims,\r\nwould become the slaves of every base passion, and of all physical and\r\nmoral deformities. It is not yet too late. Let us repair our faults. Let\r\nus elevate, let us regenerate literature; let us bear it aloft to those\r\nnoble spheres where the soul soars in her native majes\"----\r\n\r\nI was declaiming with fire, my enthusiasm was becoming more and more\r\nheated, when Henry Murger interrupted me by asking,--\"Do you think\r\nMonsieur Buloz will pay me in advance?\"\r\n\r\nThis question produced on my missionary's enthusiasm the same effect a\r\ntub of cold water would have upon an excited poodle-dog.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur Murger,\" I replied, without being too much disconcerted, \"you\r\nwill arrange those details with Monsieur Buloz. All I can do is to\r\nintroduce you.\"\r\n\r\nWe reached the office. I was afraid I might embarrass Monsieur Buloz and\r\nMonsieur Murger, if I remained with them; I therefore took a book and\r\nwent into the garden. I was called back in twenty minutes, and was\r\nbriefly told that Henry Murger had engaged to write a novel for the\r\n\"Revue.\" We went out together; but we had scarcely passed three doors,\r\nwhen Murger said hurriedly to me,--\"I beg your pardon, I have forgotten\r\nsomething!\"--and he went back to the office. I afterwards found out\r\nthat this \"something\" was an advance of money which he asked for upon a\r\nnovel whose first syllable he had not yet written.\r\n\r\nIf I dwell upon these miserable details, it is not (God forbid!) to\r\ninsult laborious poverty, or talent forced to struggle against the\r\nhardships of life or the embarrassments of improvident, careless youth.\r\nNo,--but there was here, and this is the reason I speak of it, the\r\n_trade-mark_ of that literary living-by-the wits which had taken entire\r\npossession of Henry Murger, against which he had struggled in vain all\r\nhis life long, and which at last crushed him in its feverish grasp.\r\nLiving by the wits was to Henry Murger what _roulette_ is to the\r\ngambler, what brandy is to the drunkard, what the traps of the police\r\nare to the knave and the burglar: he cursed it, but he could not quit\r\nit; he lived in it, he lived by it, he died of it. The first time I\r\ntalked with Murger, and every subsequent conversation I had with him,\r\nbrought up money incessantly, in every tone, in every form; and when,\r\nhaving become more familiar with what he called my squeamishness, he\r\ntalked more frankly to me, I saw that he required to support him a sum\r\nof money three times greater than the annual income of which a whole\r\nfamily of office-holders in the country, or even in Paris, live with\r\nease. This brought on him protests, bailiffs, constables, incredible\r\ncomplications, continual uneasiness, a hankering after pecuniary\r\nsuccess, eternal complaints against publishers, magazine-editors,\r\ntheatre-managers, anxious negotiations, an immense loss of time, an\r\nincredible wear-and-tear of brain, annoyances and cares enough to put\r\nevery thought to flight and to dry every source of inspiration and of\r\npoetry. Remember that Henry Murger is one of the luckiest of the new men\r\nwho have appeared within these last fifteen years, for he received the\r\ncross of the Legion of Honor, which, as everybody knows, is never given\r\nexcept to men who deserve it. Judge, then, what the others\r\nmust be! Judge what must be the abortions, the disdained, the\r\nsupernumeraries,--those who sleep in lodging-houses at two cents a\r\nnight, or who eat their pitiful dinner outside the barrier-gate in a\r\nwretched eating-house patronized by hack-drivers,--those who kill\r\nthemselves with charcoal, or who hang themselves, murdered by madness or\r\nby hunger, the two pale goddesses of atheistical literatures!\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said I to Henry Murger, after we were once more seated in our\r\ncarriage, \"are you pleased with Monsieur Buloz?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--and no. The most difficult step is taken. He allows me to\r\ncontribute my masterpieces to the 'Revue des Deux Mondes,' and I shall\r\nnever forget the immense service you have done me. Although you and I do\r\nnot serve the same literary gods, I am henceforward yours to the death!\r\nBut--the book-keeper is deusedly hard on trigger. Will you believe it? I\r\nasked him to advance me forty dollars, and he refused!\"\r\n\r\nWe parted excellent friends, and he continued to assure me of his\r\ngratitude, until the carriage stopped at my door.\r\n\r\nYears passed away. Henry Murger's promised novel was long coming to the\r\n\"Revue des Deux Mondes.\" At last it came; another followed eighteen\r\nmonths afterwards; then he contributed a third. He displayed\r\nunquestionable talents; he commanded moderate success. He had been told\r\nby so many people that it was a hard matter to please the readers of the\r\n\"Revue des Deux Mondes,\" that it was necessary for him to free himself\r\nfrom all his studios' fun, and everything tinctured with the petty\r\npress, that he really believed for true everything he heard, and\r\nappeared awkward in his movements. His students, his _grisettes_, and\r\nhis young artists were all on their good behavior, but were not more\r\ndroll. Marivaux had come down one more flight of stairs. Alfred de\r\nMusset had steeped the powder and the patches in a glass of Champagne\r\nwine. Henry Murger soaked them in a bottle of brandy or in a flagon of\r\nbeer.\r\n\r\nHenry Murger's gratitude, whenever we met, continued to exhale in\r\nenthusiastic hymns. I lost sight of him for some time. I was told that\r\nhe lived somewhere in the Forest of Fontainebleau, to escape his\r\ncreditors' pursuit. At the critical moment of my literary life, I read\r\none morning in a petty newspaper a biting burlesque of which I was the\r\ngrotesque hero: I figured (my name was given in full) as a member of a\r\ntemperance society, whose members were pledged to total abstinence from\r\nthe use of ideas, wit, and style; at one of our monthly dinners, we were\r\nsaid to have devoured Balzac at the first course, De Béranger for the\r\nroast, Michelet for a side-dish, and George Sand for dessert. The next\r\nday, and every day the petty paper appeared, the joke was renewed with\r\nall sorts of variations. It was evidently a \"rig\" run on me. This joke\r\nwas signed every day \"Marcel,\" which was the name of one of the heroes\r\nof Henry Murger's novel, \"La Vie de Bohême\"; but I was very far indeed\r\nfrom thinking that the man who was under so many \"obligations\" to me (as\r\nHenry Murger always declared himself to be) should have joined the ranks\r\nof my persecutors. A few days afterwards I heard, on the best authority,\r\nthat Henry Murger was the author of these articles. I felt a deep\r\nchagrin at this discovery. Literary men constantly call Philistines and\r\nPrudhommes those who lay great stress upon the absence of moral sense as\r\none of the great defects of the school of literature and art to which\r\nMurger and his friends belong; and yet there should be a name for such\r\nconduct as this, if for no other reason, for the sake of the culprits\r\nthemselves,--as, when poor Murger acted in this way to me, he was as\r\nunconscious of what he did as when he raised heaven and earth to hunt\r\ndown a dollar. He was not guilty of a black heart, it was only absolute\r\ndeficiency of everything like moral sense. Henry Murger was under\r\nobligations to me, as he said constantly; I had introduced and\r\nrecommended him to a man and a magazine that are, as of right, difficult\r\nin the choice of their contributors; I had, for his sake, conquered\r\ntheir prejudices, borne their reproaches. Whenever his novels appeared,\r\nI treated them with indulgence, and gave them praise without examining\r\ntoo particularly into their moral tendency, to the great scandal of my\r\nusual readers, and despite the scoldings Monsieur Louis Veuillot gave\r\nme. There never was the least coolness between Henry Murger and myself;\r\nand yet, when I was attacked and harassed on every side, he hid himself\r\nunder a pseudonyme, and added his sarcasms to all the others directed\r\nagainst me, that he might gratify his admiration for De Balzac and put a\r\nlittle money in his pocket.\r\n\r\nBy-and-by I continued to meet Henry Murger again on the Boulevard, and\r\nat the first performance of new pieces. Do you imagine he shunned me?\r\nNot a bit of it. He did not seem on these rare occasions to feel the\r\nleast embarrassment. He gave me cordial shakes of the hand, or he\r\nbestowed on me one of those profound bows which brought his bald head on\r\na level with his waistcoat-pockets. Then he published a novel in \"Le\r\nMoniteur,\" after which he was decorated. Nothing was now heard from or\r\nof him for a long time. Not a line by Henry Murger appeared anywhere. I\r\nnever heard that any piece by him was received, or even refused, by a\r\nsingle one of the eighteen theatres in Paris. At last I met him one day\r\nbefore the Variétés Theatre. I went up to speak to him, and ended by\r\nasking the invariable question between literary men,--\"What are you at\r\nwork on now? How comes it that so long a time has elapsed since you gave\r\nus something to read or to applaud?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will tell you why,\" he replied, with melancholy _sang-froid_. \"It is\r\nnot a question of literature, it is a question of arithmetic. I owe\r\neight hundred dollars to Madame Porcher, the wife of the\r\n'authors'-tickets' dealer, who is always ready to advance money to\r\ndramatic authors, and to whom we are all constantly in debt. I owe four\r\nhundred dollars to the 'Moniteur,' and three hundred dollars to the\r\n'Revue des Deux Mondes.' Follow my reasoning now: Were I to bring out a\r\nplay, my excellent friend, Madame Porcher, would lay hands on all the\r\nproceeds, and I should receive nothing. Were I to give a novel to the\r\n'Moniteur,' I should have to write twenty _feuilletons_ (you know they\r\npay twenty dollars a _feuilleton_ there) before I cancelled my old debt.\r\nWere I to contribute to the 'Revue des Deux Mondes,' as soon as my six\r\nsheets (at fifty dollars a sheet, that would be three hundred dollars)\r\nwere printed and published, the editor would say to me, 'We are even\r\nnow.' So you see that it would be unpardonable prodigality on my part to\r\npublish anything; therefore I have determined not to work at all, in\r\norder to avoid spending my money, and I am lazy--from economy!\"\r\n\r\nHis reply disarmed the little resentment I had left. I took his hand in\r\nmine, and said to him,--\"See here, Murger, I must confess to you I was a\r\nlittle angry with you; but your arithmetic is more literary than you\r\nthink it. You have given me a lesson of contemporary literature; and I\r\nsay to you, as the 'Revue des Deux Mondes' would say, 'Murger, we are\r\neven!'\"\r\n\r\nI ran off without waiting for his reply, and whispered to myself, as I\r\nwent, \"And yet Henry Murger is the most talented and the most honest of\r\nthem all!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLet me continue the story of my misfortunes. The tempest was unchained\r\nagainst me. It is true, there were among my adversaries some persons\r\nunder obligations to me,--some persons who were full of enthusiasm at my\r\nfirst manner, and who would have made wry faces enough, had I published\r\ntheir flattering letters to me,--other persons, to whom I had rendered\r\npecuniary services,--others, again, who had come to me with hat in hand\r\nand supple knees, to beg my permission to allow them to dramatize my\r\nnovels. But what were these miserable considerations, when the great\r\ninterests of national literature, taste, and glory were at stake? I was\r\nthe vile detractor, the impious scorner of these glories, and it was but\r\njustice that I should be put in the pillory and made the butt of rotten\r\neggs. Voltaire blasphemed, Béranger insulted, Victor Hugo outraged, were\r\noffences which cried aloud for chastisement and for vengeance. Balzac's\r\nshade especially complained and clamored for justice. It is true, that,\r\nwhile Balzac was alive, he was not accustomed to anything like such\r\nadmiration. He openly avowed that he detested newspaper-writers, and\r\nthey returned the detestation with interest. Everybody, while he was\r\nalive, declared him to be odd, eccentric, half-crazy, absurd. His\r\nfriends and his publishers, in fine, everybody who had anything to do\r\nwith him, told rather disreputable stories about him. No matter for\r\nthat. Balzac was dead, Balzac was a god, the god of all these\r\nlivers-by-the-wits, who but for him would have been atheists. Monsieur\r\nPaulin Limayrac tore me to pieces in \"La Presse.\" Monsieur Eugène\r\nPelletan shot me in \"Le Siècle.\" Monsieur Taxile Delord mauled me in \"Le\r\nCharivari.\" To this episode of my exposition in the pillory belongs an\r\nanecdote which I cannot omit.\r\n\r\nI was about to set off for the country, where I reckoned upon spending\r\nsome weeks of the month of May, in order to recover somewhat from these\r\nincessant attacks made upon me. I had read in a _café_, while taking my\r\nbeefsteak and cup of chocolate, the various details of the punishment I\r\nwas about to undergo. One of my tormentors, who was a great deal more\r\ncelebrated for his aversion to water and clean linen than for any\r\narticle he had ever written, declared that I was about to be banished\r\nfrom everything like decent society; another vowed by all the deities of\r\nhis Olympus that I was a mountebank and a skeptic, who had undertaken to\r\ndefend sound doctrines and to tomahawk eminent writers simply by way of\r\nbringing myself into public notice; a third painted me as a poor wretch\r\nwho had come from his provincial home with his pockets filled with\r\nmanuscripts, and was going about Paris begging favorable notices as a\r\nmeans of touching publishers and booksellers; a fourth depicted me, on\r\nthe other hand, as a wealthy fellow, who was so diseased with a mania\r\nfor literature that I paid newspapers and reviews to publish my\r\ncontributions, which no human being would have accepted gratuitously. As\r\nI left the _café_, one of my intimate friends ran up to me. His face\r\nexpressed that mixture of cordial commiseration and desire to make a\r\nfuss about the matter which one's friends' faces always wear under these\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said he, \"what do you think of the way they treat you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, they are all at it,--Monsieur Edmond About, Monsieur Louis Ulbach,\r\nMonsieur Paulin Limayrac, Monsieur Henry Murger, Monsieur Taxile\r\nDelord,\"----\r\n\r\n\"Ah! by the way, have you seen his article of yesterday?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"You should have read that. Those in the morning's papers are nothing to\r\nit. Really, you ought not to leave town without seeing it.\" Looking very\r\nimportant, he added,--\"In your position, you should know everything\r\nwritten against you.\"\r\n\r\nI followed this friendly advice, and went to the Rue du Croissant, where\r\nthe office of \"Le Charivari\" moulders. As the place is anything but\r\nattractive to well-bred persons, allow me to get there by the longest\r\nroad, and to go through the Faubourg Saint Honoré. A month before the\r\nconversation above reported took place in front of a _café_-door, I had\r\nthe pleasure of meeting the Count de ----, an intellectual gentleman who\r\noccupies an influential place in some aristocratic drawing-rooms which\r\nstill retain a partiality for literature. He said to me,--\r\n\r\n\"Do you know Monsieur Ernest Legouvé?\"\r\n\r\n\"Assuredly! The most polite and most agreeable of all the generals of\r\n_Alexander_ Scribe; the author of 'Adrienne Lecouvreur,' which Rachel\r\nplayed so well, of 'Médée,' in which Madame Ristori shines; a charming\r\ngentleman, who, in our age of clubs, cigars, stables, jockeys, and\r\nslang, has had the good taste to like feminine society. He has a\r\nconsiderable estate; he belongs to the French Academy; his house is\r\nagreeable; his manners delightful; his dinners unequalled. If in all\r\nhappiness there is a dash of management, where is the harm in Monsieur\r\nErnest Legouvé's case? Why should not gentlemen, too, be sometimes\r\nadroit? Rogues are so always! Besides, has not a little art always been\r\nnecessary to effect an entrance into the French Academy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur Ernest Legouvé and I were at college together, and he bids me\r\nbear you an invitation which I am sure you will not refuse. He has\r\nwritten a play upon the delicate and thorny subject on which Monsieur\r\nJules Sandeau has written his admirable comedy, 'Le Gendre de Monsieur\r\nPoirier': with this difference, however: Monsieur Legouvé has taken, not\r\na ruined and brilliant noble who marries the daughter of a plebeian, but\r\na young man, the architect of his own fortunes, with a most vulgar name,\r\nwho, on the score of talents, energy, delicacy of head and heart, is\r\nloved by a young lady of noble birth, is accepted by her family, and\r\nenters by right of conquest into that society from which his birth\r\nexcluded him.\"\r\n\r\n\"That theme is rather more difficult: for, when Mademoiselle Poirier\r\nmarries the Marquis de Presles, she becomes the Marquise de Presles;\r\nwhereas, when Mademoiselle de Montmorency marries Monsieur Bernard, she\r\nbecomes plain Madame Bernard.\"\r\n\r\n\"True enough! But Monsieur Legouvé is perplexed by a scruple which\r\nreflects the greatest honor upon him: he entertains sincere respect,\r\ngreat sympathy, for aristocratic distinctions; therefore he is anxious\r\nto assure himself, before his piece is brought out in public, that it\r\ndoes not contain a single scene or a single word which will be offensive\r\nor disagreeable to noble ears. To satisfy himself in this particular,\r\nhe has asked me to allow him to read his comedy at my house. I shall\r\ninvite the Duchess de ----, the Marquis de ----, the Countess de ----,\r\nthe General de ----, the Duke de ----, the Marquise de ----, and the\r\nBaroness de ----. I shall add to these two or three critics known in\r\ngood society, among whom I reckon upon you. In fine, this preliminary\r\nAreopagus will be composed of sons of the Crusaders, who are almost as\r\nsprightly as sons of Voltaire. Now Monsieur Ernest Legouvé will not be\r\nsatisfied with his comedy, unless these gentlefolk unanimously decide\r\nthat he need not blot a single line of it. Will you come? Remember,\r\nMonsieur Ernest Legouvé invites you.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Count, I willingly accept your proposition. Monsieur Legouvé\r\nreads admirably, and his plays are all agreeable. Nevertheless, let me\r\ntell you that this trial will prove nothing. Our poor society is like\r\nSganarelle's wife, who liked to be thrashed. It has borne smiling, and\r\nrepaid with wealth and fame, much more ardent attacks than Monsieur\r\nLegouvé can make.\"\r\n\r\nCount de ---- and I shook hands, and parted. A few evenings afterwards\r\nthe reading took place. It was just what I expected. There were as many\r\nmarquises and duchesses (_real_ duchesses) as there were kings to\r\napplaud Talma in the Erfurt pit. The noble assembly listened to Monsieur\r\nLegouvés's comedy with that rather absent-minded urbanity and with those\r\ncharming exclamations of admiration which have been constantly given to\r\neverybody who has read a piece in a drawing-room, from the days of the\r\nViscount d'Arlincourt and his \"Le Solitaire,\" to the days of Monsieur\r\nViennet, of the French Academy, and his \"Arbogaste.\" Monsieur Legouvé's\r\nplay, which was then called \"Le Nom du Mari,\" and which has since been\r\nplayed under the title of \"Par Droit de Conquête,\" was pleasing. My ears\r\nwere not so much offended by the antagonism of poor nobility and wealthy\r\nupstarts, which Monsieur Legouvé treated neither better nor worse than\r\nany other has done, as by the details of roads, bridges, marsh-draining,\r\ncanals, railways, coal, coke, and the like, which were dead-weights on\r\nThalia's light robe; and the improbability of the plot was not so much\r\nthe marriage of a noble girl to the son of an apple-dealer as was the\r\nperfection given to the young engineer: every virtue and every grace\r\nwere showered on him. The piece was unanimously pronounced successful.\r\nThe aristocratic audience applauded Monsieur Legouvé with their little\r\ngloved hands, which never make much noise. He was complimented so\r\ndelicately that he was sincerely touched. There was not the slightest\r\nobjection, the lightest murmur made to the piece, and there trembled in\r\nmy eye that little tear Madame de Sévigné speaks of.\r\n\r\nBut let us quit this drawing-room, and turn our steps towards the Rue du\r\nCroissant, where the office of \"Le Charivari\" is to be found. Balzac has\r\ndescribed in \"Les Illusions Perdues\" the offices of these petty\r\nnewspapers: the passage divided into two equal portions, one of which\r\nleads to the editor's room, and the other to the grated counter where\r\nthe clerk sits to receive subscribers. Everybody knows the appearance of\r\nthese old houses, these staircases, these flimsy partitions, with their\r\nbad light coming through a window whose panes are veiled with a triple\r\ncoating of dust, smoke, and soot,--the whitewashed walls bearing\r\ninnumerable traces of fingers covered with ink, mingled with\r\npencil-caricatures and grotesque inscriptions. Although it was in the\r\nmonth of May that I made this visit, I shivered with cold as I entered\r\nthis old house, and my gorge rose in disgust at the unaired smell and\r\nignoble scenes which everywhere appeared. The clerk I applied to had the\r\nvery face one might expect to find in such a place: one of those\r\ncolorless, hard, sinister faces which are to be seen in nearly all the\r\nscenes of Paris reality. All things were in harmony in this shop: the\r\nair, and the light, and the house,--the letter as well as the spirit. I\r\nasked the clerk to give me the file for the month of April. I soon\r\nfound and read Monsieur Taxile Delord's article. Monsieur Taxile Delord\r\ncomes from some one of the southern departments of France. He made his\r\nfirst appearance in public in \"Le Sémaphore,\" the well-known newspaper\r\nof Marseilles; but the twilight of a provincial life could not suit this\r\neagle, and in the course of a few years he came up to Paris. Alas!\r\nMonsieur Taxile Delord was soon obliged to add the secret sorrows of\r\ndisappointed ambition to the original gayety of his character. His\r\ndeepest sorrow was to look upon himself for a grave and thoughtful\r\nstatesman, and be condemned by fate to a chronic state of fun and to\r\nhard labor at pun-making for life. Imagine Junius damned to lead\r\nTouchstone's life! He became sourness itself. His puns were lugubrious.\r\nHis fun grew heavy, and his gayety was funereal. The pretensions of this\r\nchecked gravity which settled upon his factitious hilarity were enough\r\nto melt the hearts even of his enemies, if such a fellow could pretend\r\nto have enemies. Once this galley-slave of fun tried to make his escape\r\nfrom the galley. He wrote a play; and as the manager of one of the\r\ntheatres was his friend, he had it played. The democratic opinions of\r\nMonsieur Taxile Delord raised favorable prejudices among the school-boys\r\nof the Latin Quarter; but who can escape his fate? The masterpiece was\r\nhissed. Its title was \"The End of the Comedy\"; and a wretched witling\r\npretended that the piece was ill-named, since the pit refused to see the\r\nend of the comedy. Thereupon Monsieur Taxile Delord adopted the method\r\nof Gulliver's tailor, who measured for clothes according to the rules of\r\narithmetic: he demonstrated that his piece was played three times from\r\nbeginning to end,--that, as the manager was his particular friend, and\r\nas the Odeon was always empty, he might have had it played thirty\r\ntimes,--and therefore that we were all bound to be grateful to him for\r\nhis moderation. This last argument met no person bold enough to\r\ncontradict it, and the subscribers to \"Le Charivari\" (which is the\r\n\"Punch\" of Paris) were seized with holy horror, when they thought, that,\r\nbut for Monsieur Taxile Delord's moderation, \"The End of the Comedy\"\r\nmight have been played seven-and-twenty times more.\r\n\r\nWhat had I done to excite his ire? I had not treated Béranger with\r\nsufficient respect, and Monsieur Taxile Delord, though a joker by trade,\r\nwould not hear of any fun on this subject. His genius had shaped itself\r\nexactly on Béranger's, and he resented as a personal affront every\r\ninsult offered to the songster. Of a truth, Béranger's fate was a hard\r\none, and all my attacks on him were not half so bad as this treatment he\r\nreceived at the hands of Monsieur Taxile Delord. Poor Béranger! So\r\nMonsieur Taxile Delord took up the quarrel on his account, and relieved\r\nhis gall by throwing it on me. When I read his article, I felt\r\nhumiliated,--but not as the writer desired,--I felt humiliated for the\r\npress, and for literature, and for Béranger, who really did not deserve\r\nthis hard fate. The humid office, full of dirt and dust and\r\nprinting-ink, disgusted and depressed me, and I involuntarily thought of\r\nCount de ----'s drawing-room, and that aristocratic society where\r\neverything was flowers, courtesy, perfumes, elegance, where people could\r\nnot even feel hatred towards their enemies, and where the genial poet,\r\nMonsieur Ernest Legouvé, surrounded by the most charming and most\r\nsprightly women of Paris, recently obtained so delightful a triumph.\r\n\r\nAll at once a sympathetic and clear voice, a voice which I thought I had\r\nheard in better society than where I was, reached my ears. Hid in the\r\ndark corner where I sat, and where nobody could discover me, I saw the\r\ndoor of the editor's room open and Monsieur Taxile Delord appear and\r\nescort to the door a visitor. It was Monsieur Ernest Legouvé! They\r\npassed close to me, and I heard Monsieur Ernest Legouvé say to Monsieur\r\nDelord,--\"My dear Sir, I recommend my play, 'Le Nom du Mari,' to you; I\r\nhope you will be pleased with it!\"\r\n\r\nThis contrast annoyed me. I was then horribly out of humor from an\r\nirritating prelection, and I felt towards Monsieur Legouvé that sort of\r\nvexation the unlucky feel towards the lucky, the poor towards the rich,\r\nthe hunchbacks towards handsome men, and the awkward towards the adroit.\r\nI said to myself,--\"Armand, my poor Armand, you will never be aught but\r\na most stupid fool!\"\r\n\r\nWe add no commentary to this picture of literary life in Paris. We leave\r\nthe reader to draw his own conclusions. He needs no assistance,--for the\r\npicture is painted in bright colors, and the light is thrown with no\r\nparsimonious hand upon every corner. It is a curious exhibition of a\r\nmost unhealthy state of things. It explains a great many of those\r\nliterary mysteries, which seem so unaccountable, in the most brilliant\r\ncapital of the world.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[24] _Elsie Venner_, by Oliver OEendell (_sic_) Holmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MASKERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Yesternight, as late I strayed\r\n    Through the orchard's mottled shade,--\r\n    Coming to the moonlit alleys,\r\n    Where the sweet Southwind, that dallies\r\n    All day with the Queen of Roses,\r\n    All night on her breast reposes,--\r\n    Drinking from the dewy blooms,\r\n    Silences, and scented glooms\r\n    Of the warm-breathed summer night,\r\n    Long, deep draughts of pure delight,--\r\n    Quick the shaken foliage parted,\r\n    And from out its shadows darted\r\n    Dwarf-like forms, with hideous faces,\r\n    Cries, contortions, and grimaces.\r\n    Still I stood beneath the lonely,\r\n    Sighing lilacs, saying only,--\r\n    \"Little friends, you can't alarm me;\r\n    Well I know you would not harm me!\"\r\n    Straightway dropped each painted mask,\r\n    Sword of lath, and paper casque,\r\n    And a troop of rosy girls\r\n    Ran and kissed me through their curls.\r\n\r\n    Caught within their net of graces,\r\n    I looked round on shining faces.\r\n    Sweetly through the moonlit alleys\r\n    Rang their laughter's silver sallies.\r\n    Then along the pathway, light\r\n    With the white bloom of the night,\r\n    I went peaceful, pacing slow,\r\n    Captive held in arms of snow.\r\n    Happy maids! of you I learn\r\n    Heavenly maskers to discern!\r\n    So, when seeming griefs and harms\r\n    Fill life's garden with alarms,\r\n    Through its inner walks enchanted\r\n    I will ever move undaunted.\r\n    Love hath messengers that borrow\r\n    Tragic masks of fear and sorrow,\r\n    When they come to do us kindness,--\r\n    And but for our tears and blindness,\r\n    We should see, through each disguise,\r\n    Cherub cheeks and angel eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCULLET.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Good morning! Is it really a rainy day?\" asked Miselle, imploringly, as\r\nshe seated herself at the breakfast-table, and glanced from Monsieur to\r\nthe heavy sky and the vane upon the coach-house, steadily pointing west.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, I hope not. Are you ready for Sandwich?\" smilingly replied the\r\nhost.\r\n\r\n\"More than ready,--eager. But the clouds.\"\r\n\r\n\"One learns here upon the coast to brave the clouds; we have, to be\r\nsure, a sea-turn just now, and perhaps there will be fog-showers\r\nby-and-by, but nothing that need prevent our excursion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Delightful!\" exclaimed Optima, Miselle, and Madame, applying themselves\r\nto eggs and toast with that calm confidence in a masculine decision so\r\nsustaining to the feminine nature.\r\n\r\nThe early breakfast over, Monsieur, with a gentle hint to the ladies of\r\nhaste in the matter of toilet, went to see that Gypsy and Fanny were\r\nproperly harnessed, and that a due number of cushions, rugs, and\r\nwater-proof wrappers were placed in the roomy carriage.\r\n\r\nSurely, never were hats so hastily assumed, never did gloves condescend\r\nto be so easily found, never were fewer hasty returns for \"something I\r\nhave forgotten,\" and Monsieur had barely time to send two messages to\r\nthe effect that all was ready, when the feminine trio descending upon\r\nhim triumphantly disproved once and forever the hoary slander upon their\r\nsex of habitual unpunctuality.\r\n\r\nWith quiet self-sacrifice Optima placed herself beside Madame in the\r\nback of the carryall, leaving for Miselle the breezy seat in front, with\r\nall its facilities for seeing, hearing, smelling, breathing; and let us\r\nhope that the little banquet thus prepared for the conscience of that\r\nyoung woman gave her as much satisfaction as Miselle's feast of the\r\nsenses did to her.\r\n\r\nArching their necks, tossing their manes, spattering the dewy sand with\r\ntheir little hoofs, Gypsy and Fanny rapidly whirled the carriage through\r\nthe drowsy town, across the Pilgrim Brook, and so, by the pretty suburb\r\nof \"T'other Side,\" (which no child of the Mayflower shall ever consent\r\nto call Wellingsley,) to the open road skirting the blue waters of the\r\nbay.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, this is fine!\" cried Miselle, snatching from seaward deep breaths\r\nof the east wind laden with the wild life of ocean and the freedom of\r\nboundless space.\r\n\r\n\"Here we have it!\" remarked Monsieur, somewhat irrelevantly, as he\r\nhastily unbuckled the apron and spread it over his own lap and\r\nMiselle's, just in time to catch a heavy dash of rain.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid it is going to be stormy, after all,\" piteously murmured\r\nMiselle.\r\n\r\n\"I told you we should have fog-showers, you know,\" suggested Monsieur,\r\nwith a quiet smile.\r\n\r\n\"But what must we do?--go home?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed!--we will go to Sandwich, let it rain twice, four times as\r\nhard as this,--unless, indeed, Madame gives orders to the contrary. What\r\nsay you, Madame?\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, let us go on for the present. We can turn round at any time, if\r\nit becomes necessary\"; and Madame smiled benevolently at Miselle, down\r\nwhose face the rain-drops streamed, but who stoutly asserted,--\r\n\r\n\"Oh, this is nothing. Only a fog-shower, you know. We shall have it fine\r\ndirectly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not till we are out of Eel River. This valley gathers all the clouds,\r\nand they often get rain here when the sun is shining everywhere else.\"\r\n\r\n\"A regular vale of tears! Happy the remnant of the world that dwelleth\r\nnot in Eel River!\" murmured Miselle, surreptitiously pulling her\r\nwater-proof cloak about her shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"Let me help you. Really, though, you are getting very wet, dear,\"\r\nremonstrated Optima.\r\n\r\n\"Not in the least. I enjoy it excessively. Besides, the shower is just\r\nover.--What church is that, Monsieur, with the very disproportionate\r\nsteeple?\" inquired Miselle, pointing to a square gray box, surmounted by\r\na ludicrously short and obtuse spire, expressive of a certain dogged\r\nobstinacy of purpose.\r\n\r\n\"The church is an Orthodox meetinghouse, and the steeple is Orthodox\r\ntoo,--for the Cape. Anything else would blow down in the spring gales.\r\nPark-Street steeple, for instance, would stand a very poor chance here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Miselle, vaguely, and she felt in her heart how this great\r\nocean that dwarfs or prostrates the works of man replaces them by a\r\ntemple builded in his own soul of proportions so lofty that God Himself\r\nmay dwell visibly therein.\r\n\r\nAnd now, having traversed the tearful valley, the road wound up the\r\nDelectable Mountains beyond, and so into the pine forest, through whose\r\nclashing needles glints of sunshine began to creep, while overhead the\r\ngray shaded softly into pearl and dazzling white and palest blue.\r\n\r\n\"There are deer in these Sandwich woods. See if we cannot find a pair of\r\ngreat brown eyes peering out at us from some of the thickets,\" suggested\r\nMadame.\r\n\r\n\"Charming! If only we might see one! How young this nation is, after\r\nall, when aboriginal deer roam the woods within fifty miles of Boston!\"\r\n\r\n\"But without game-laws they will soon be exterminated. A great many are\r\nshot every winter, and the farmers complain bitterly of those that\r\nremain. Some of their crops are quite ruined by the deer, they say,\"\r\nremarked Monsieur.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind. There are plenty of crops, and but very few deer. I\r\npronounce for the game-laws,\" recklessly declared Miselle.\r\n\r\nBut the impending battle of political economy was averted by Madame's\r\nexclamation of,--\r\n\r\n\"See, here is Sacrifice Rock. Let us stop and look at it a moment.\"\r\n\r\nGypsy and Fanny, wild with the sparkling upland air, were with\r\ndifficulty persuaded to halt opposite a great flat granite boulder,\r\nsloping from the skirt of the forest toward the road, and nearly covered\r\nwith pebbles and bits of decayed wood.\r\n\r\n\"It is Sacrifice Rock,\" explained Monsieur. \"From the days of the\r\nPilgrims to our own, no Indian passes this way without laying some\r\noffering upon it. It would have been buried long ago, but that the\r\nspring and autumn winds sweep away all the lighter deposits. You would\r\nfind the hollow at its back half filled with them. Once there may have\r\nbeen human sacrifices,--tradition says so, at least; but now there is\r\nseldom anything more precious than what you see.\"\r\n\r\n\"But to what deity were the offerings made?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some savage Manitou, no doubt, but no one can say with certainty\r\nanything about it. The degenerate half-breeds who live in this vicinity\r\nonly keep up the custom from tradition. They are called Christians now,\r\nyou know, and are quite above such idolatrous practices.\"\r\n\r\n\"At any rate, I will add my contribution to this altar of an unknown\r\nGod. Besides, there are some blackberries that I must have,\" exclaimed\r\nOptima, releasing her active limbs from the carriage in a very summary\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nTossing a little stick upon the rock, she hastened to gather the\r\nabundant fruit, a little for herself, a good deal for Madame and\r\nMiselle, until Gypsy and Fanny stamped and neighed with impatience, and\r\nMonsieur cried cheerily,--\r\n\r\n\"Come, young woman, come! We are not half-way to Sandwich, and the\r\nhorses will be devoured by these flies as surely as Bishop Hatto was by\r\nmice.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so on through miles of merry woodland, by fields and orchards, whose\r\nevery crop is a fresh conquest of man over Nature in this one of her\r\nmost niggardly phases, by desolate cabins and lonely farms, until at a\r\nsudden turn the broad, beautiful sea swept up to glorify the scene. And\r\nwhile Miselle with flushed cheeks and tearful eyes drank in the ever-new\r\ndelight of its presence, Monsieur began a story of how a man, almost a\r\nstranger to him, had come one winter evening and begged him for God's\r\nlove to go and help him search for the body of his brother, reported by\r\na wandering madwoman to be lying on this beach, and how he begged so\r\npiteously that the listener could not choose but go.\r\n\r\nAnd as Monsieur vividly pictured that long, lonely drive through the\r\nmidnight woods, the desolate monotony of the beach, along whose margin\r\ncurled the foam-wreaths of the rising tide, while beyond phosphorescent\r\nlights played over a world of weltering black waters,--as he told how,\r\nafter hours of patient search, they found the poor sodden corpse and\r\ntenderly cared for it,--as Monsieur quietly told his tale and never knew\r\nthat he was a hero, Miselle turned shuddering from sea and beach and the\r\nmocking play of the crested waves, as they leaped in the sunshine and\r\nthen sank back to sport hideously with other corpses hidden beneath\r\ntheir smiling surface.\r\n\r\nPresently the sea was again shut off by woodland, and the scattered\r\nhouses closed into a village, nay, a town, the town of Sandwich; and\r\nswinging through it at an easy rate, the carriage halted before an\r\nodd-looking building, consisting of a quaint old inn, porched and\r\ngambrel-roofed, joined in most unholy union to a big, square, staring\r\nbox, of true Yankee architecture.\r\n\r\nDescending with reluctance, even after three hours of immobility, from\r\nher breezy seat, Miselle followed Madame into the quiet house, whose\r\nlandlord, like many another man, makes moan for \"the good old times\"\r\nwhen summer tourists and commercial travellers filled his rooms and the\r\nlong dining-table, now unoccupied, save by our travellers and two young\r\nmen connected with the glass-manufactories.\r\n\r\nRest, plenty of cool water, and dinner having restored the energies of\r\nthe travellers, it was proposed that they should proceed at once to the\r\nGlass Works. And now, indeed, did Fortune smile upon this band of\r\nadventurous spirits; for when the question of a guide arose, mine host\r\nof the inn announced himself not only willing to act in that capacity,\r\nbut eminently qualified therefor by long experience as an operative in\r\nvarious departments of the works.\r\n\r\n\"How fortunate that the stage-coaches and peddlers no longer frequent\r\nSandwich! If our friend had them to attend to, he could not devote\r\nhimself to us in this charming manner,\" suggested Optima, as she and\r\nMiselle gayly followed Monsieur, Madame, and Cicerone down the long\r\nsunny street, whose loungers turned a glance of lazy wonder upon the\r\nstrangers.\r\n\r\nPassing presently a monotonous row of lodging-houses for the workmen,\r\nand a public square with a fountain, which, as Optima suggested, might\r\nbe made very pretty with the addition of some water, the travellers\r\napproached a large brick building, many-windowed, many-chimneyed, and\r\noffering ingress through a low-browed arch of so gloomy an aspect that\r\none looked at its key-stone half expecting to read there the well-known\r\nDantean legend,--\r\n\r\n    \"Lasciate ogni speranza, voi chi'ntrate!\"\r\n\r\nNor was the illusion quite destroyed by handling, for through the arch\r\nand a short passage one entered a large, domed apartment, brick-floored\r\nand dimly lighted, whose atmosphere was the breath of a dozen flashing\r\nfurnaces, whose occupants were grimy gnomes wildly sporting with strange\r\nshapes of molten metal.\r\n\r\n\"This is the glass-room, and in these furnaces the glass is melted; but\r\nperhaps you will go first and see how it is mixed, and how the pots are\r\nmade to boil it in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, let us begin at the beginning,\" said all, and were led from the\r\nInferno across a cool, green yard, into a building specially devoted to\r\nthe pots. In a great bin lay masses of soft brown clay in its crude\r\ncondition, and upon the floor were heaped fragments of broken pots,\r\ncalcined by use in the furnaces, and now waiting to be ground up into a\r\nfine powder between the wheels of a powerful mill working steadily in\r\none corner of the building. In another, a row of boxes or pens were\r\npartially filled with a powdered mixture of the raw and burnt clay, and\r\nthis, being moistened with water, was worked to a proper consistency\r\nbeneath the bare feet of several stout men.\r\n\r\n\"This work, like the treading of the wine-press, can be properly\r\nperformed only by human feet,\" remarked Monsieur.\r\n\r\n\"So when next we sip nectar from one of your straw-stemmed glasses, we\r\nwill remember these gentlemen and their brothers of the wine-countries,\r\nand gratefully acknowledge that without their exertions we could have\r\nhad neither wine nor goblet,\" said Miselle, maliciously.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" suggested Optima, \"we will enjoy the result and forget the\r\nprocess. But what is that man about?\"\r\n\r\n\"Making sausages out of cheese, I should say,\" replied Monsieur; and the\r\ncomparison was almost unavoidable; for upon a coarse table lay masses of\r\nmoulded clay, in form and size exactly like cheeses, from which the\r\nworkman separated with a wooden knife a small portion to be rolled\r\nbeneath his hand into cylindrical shapes some four inches in length by\r\ntwo in diameter.\r\n\r\nThese a lad carefully placed upon a long and narrow board to carry up to\r\nthe pot-room, whither he was followed by the whole party.\r\n\r\nMiselle's first impression, upon entering this great chamber, was, that\r\nshe was following a drove of elephants; but as she skirted the regular\r\nranks of the great dun monsters and came to the front, she concluded\r\nthat she had stumbled upon the factory of Ali Baba's oil-jars. At any\r\nrate, the old picture in the \"Arabian Nights\" represented Morgiana in\r\nthe act of pouring the boiling oil into vessels marvellously like these,\r\nand in each of these was room for at least four robbers of true\r\nmelodramatic stature.\r\n\r\nAmong these jars, with the noiseless solicitude of a mother in her\r\nsleeping nursery, wandered their author and guardian, a pale, keen man,\r\nand so rare an enthusiast in his art that one listening to him could\r\nhardly fail to believe that the highest degree of thought, skill, and\r\nexperience might worthily be expended upon the construction of these\r\nseething-pots for molten glass.\r\n\r\n\"Will you look at this one? It is my last,\" said he, tenderly removing a\r\ndamp cloth from the surface of something like the half of a hogshead\r\nmade in clay.\r\n\r\n\"I have not begun to dome it in yet; it must dry another day first,\"\r\nsaid the artist, passing his hand lovingly along the smooth surface of\r\nhis work.\r\n\r\n\"Then you cannot go on with them at once?\" asked Madame.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, Ma'am! They must dry and harden between the spells of work\r\nupon them, or they never would stand their own weight. This one, you\r\nsee, is twelve inches thick in the bottom, and the sides are five inches\r\nthick at the base, and graduated to four where the curve begins. Now if\r\nI was to go right ahead, and put the roof on this mass of wet clay, I\r\nshouldn't get it done before the whole would crush in together. I have\r\nhad them do so, Ma'am, when I was younger, but I know better now. I\r\nsha'n't have that to suffer again.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what are you at work upon while this dries?\"\r\n\r\n\"Here. This one is just begun. Shall I show you how I do it? John, where\r\nare those rolls? Yes, I see. Now, Ma'am, this is the way.\"\r\n\r\nTaking one of the rolls in his left hand, and manipulating it with his\r\nright, our artist laid it upon the top of the unfinished wall, and with\r\nhis supple fingers began to dovetail and compact it into the mass,\r\npressing and smoothing the whole carefully as he went on.\r\n\r\n\"You see I must be very careful not to leave any air-bubbles in my work;\r\nif I do, there will be a crack.\"\r\n\r\n\"When the pot dries?\" asked Madame.\r\n\r\n\"No, Ma'am, when it is heated. I suppose the air expands and forces its\r\nway out,\" said the man, shyly, as if he were more in the habit of\r\nthinking philosophy than of talking it. \"But see how smooth and fine\r\nthis clay is,\" added he, enthusiastically, passing his finger through\r\none of the rolls. \"It is as close-grained and delicate as--as a lady's\r\ncheek.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, really, how could one describe the shape of these creatures?\"\r\nasked Optima aside of Miselle, as she stood contemplating a completed\r\nmonster.\r\n\r\n\"By comparing them to an Esquimaux lodge, with one little arched window\r\njust at the spring of the dome. Doesn't that give it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps. I never saw an Esquimaux lodge; did you, my dear?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, nor anything else in the least degree resembling these, unless it\r\nwas the picture of the oil-jars. Choose, my Optima, between the two.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hark! we are losing something worth hearing.\"\r\n\r\nSo the young women opened their ears, and heard the pallid enthusiast\r\ntell how, after days and weeks of labor, and months of seasoning, the\r\npots were laboriously carried to a kiln, where they were slowly brought\r\nto a red heat, and then suffered to cool as slowly. How the pot was then\r\ntaken to one of the furnaces of the Inferno, and a portion of its side\r\nremoved to receive it; how it was then built in, and reheated before the\r\nglass-material was thrown in; and how, after all this care and toil, it\r\nwas perhaps not a week before it cracked or gave way at some point, and\r\nmust be taken away to make room for another. But this was unusually\r\n\"hard luck,\" and the pots sometimes held good as long as three months.\r\n\r\n\"And what becomes of the old ones?\" asked Optima, sympathetically.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, they are all used over again, Miss. There must be a proportion of\r\nburnt clay mixed with the raw, or it would be too rich to harden.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what is the proportion?\"\r\n\r\n\"About one-third of the cooked clay, and two-thirds of the raw.\"\r\n\r\n\"And where does the clay come from?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nearly all from Sturbridge, in England. Some has been brought from Gay\r\nHead, on Martha's Vineyard; but it doesn't answer like the imported.\"\r\n\r\nLeaving the courteous artist in glass-pots to his labors, the party,\r\ncrossing again the breezy yard, entered a dismal brick-paved\r\nbasement-room, where grim bakers were attending upon a number of huge\r\novens. One of these was just being filled; but instead of white and\r\nbrown loaves, golden cake, or flaky pies, the two attendants were piling\r\nin short, thick bars of lead, and, hurry as they might, before they\r\ncould put in the last of the appointed number, little shining streams of\r\nmolten metal began to ooze from beneath the first, and trickle languidly\r\ntoward the mouth of the oven.\r\n\r\nBut our bakers were ready for them. With hasty movement they threw in a\r\nquantity of moistened clay, shaping and compacting it with their shovels\r\nas they went on, until in a very few moments they had completed a neat\r\nlittle semi-circular dike just within the door, as effectual a barrier\r\nto the glowing pool behind it, wherein the softened bars were rapidly\r\ndisappearing, as was ever the Dutchman's dike to the ocean, with whom he\r\ndisputes the sovereignty of Holland.\r\n\r\nA wooden door was now put up, and the baking was left to itself for\r\nabout twenty-four hours, at the end of which time the lead would have\r\nbecome transformed into a yellowish powder, known as massicot.\r\n\r\n\"You will see it here. They are just beginning to clear this oven,\" said\r\nCicerone, pointing to a row of large iron vessels which the workmen were\r\nfilling with the contents of the just opened kiln.\r\n\r\n\"And what next? What is it to the glass?\" asked Miselle, unblushing at\r\nher ignorance.\r\n\r\n\"Next, it is put into these other kilns, and kept in motion with the\r\nlong rakes that you see here, and at the end of forty-eight hours it\r\nwill have absorbed sufficient oxygen from the atmosphere to turn it from\r\nmassicot to minium, or red-lead. Look at this, if you please.\"\r\n\r\nCicerone here pointed to other iron vessels, in shape like the bowl out\r\nof which the giant Blunderbore ate his bread and milk, while trembling\r\nlittle Jack peeped at him from the oven; but these bowls were filled\r\nwith a beautiful scarlet powder of fine consistency.\r\n\r\n\"That is red-lead, one of the most important ingredients in fine\r\nflint-glass, as it gives it brilliancy and ductility. But it is not used\r\nin the coarser glasses. And here is the sand-room.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, Cicerone led the way to a light and cheerful room of\r\ndelicious temperature, even on that summer's day, where, upon a low,\r\nbroad, iron table, heated from beneath by steam-pipes, lay a mass of\r\nwhat might indeed be sand, and yet differed as much from ordinary sand\r\nas a just washed pet-lamb differs from an old weather-beaten sheep.\r\n\r\nLike the lamb, the sand had been washed with care and much water, and\r\nnow lay reposing after its bath at lazy length, enjoying its _kief_,\r\nlike a sworn Mussulman. This sand is principally brought from the banks\r\nof Hudson River and the coast of New Jersey; but a finer article of\r\nquartz sand is found in Lanesboro', Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the room stood a great sifting-machine, worked by\r\nsteam; and the sand, after being thoroughly dried, was passed through\r\nthis, coming out a fine, glittering mass, very much resembling\r\ngranulated sugar, so far as looks are concerned.\r\n\r\n\"Now it is ready to be sent up to the mixing-room; but if you will step\r\non this drop, we will go up before it,\" said the civil workman here in\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\nSo some of the party stepped upon a solid platform about six feet\r\nsquare, lying under a trap in the floor overhead, and were slowly wound\r\nup to the mixing-room, feeling quite sure, when they stepped upon the\r\nsolid floor once more, that they had done a very heroic thing, and were\r\nnot hereafter to be dismayed by travellers' tales of descents into\r\ncoal-mines, or swinging to the tops of dizzy spires in creaking baskets.\r\n\r\nHere, in the mixing-room, stood great boxes, filled with sand, with\r\nred-lead, or with sparkling soda and potash; and beside a trough stood,\r\nshovel in hand, a good-natured-looking man, who was busily mixing\r\nportions of these three ingredients into one mass.\r\n\r\nHim Miselle assailed with questions, and learned that the trough\r\ncontained\r\n\r\n             1400 pounds sand,\r\n              350 \" ash,\r\n              100 \" soda,\r\n              800 \" red-lead,\r\n    and about 100 \" cullet.[25]\r\n\r\nThis was to be a fine quality of flint-glass, and to it might be added\r\ncoloring-matter of any desired tint; but in the choice and proportion of\r\nthis lay one of the principal secrets of the art.\r\n\r\nAll this information did the civil compounder vouchsafe to Miselle, with\r\nthe indulgent air of one who humors a child by answering his questions,\r\nalthough quite sure that the subject is far above his comprehension; and\r\nhe smiled in much amusement at seeing his answers jotted down upon her\r\ntablets. So Miselle thanked him, smiling a little in her turn, and they\r\nparted in mutual satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"These trucks you see are ready-loaded with the frit, or glass-material,\r\nand are to be wheeled down to the furnaces presently,\" said Cicerone.\r\n\"But, before following them, we had better go down and see the fires.\"\r\n\r\nDescending a short flight of stone steps, the party now entered a long,\r\ndark passage, through which a torrent of wind swept, driving before it\r\nthe ashes and glowing cinders that dropped continually from a circular\r\ngrating overhead. The ground beneath was strewn with fire, and the whole\r\narrangement offered a rare opportunity to any misanthrope whose\r\npreferences might point to death in the shape of a fiery shower-bath.\r\n\r\nIn a gloomy crypt, opening near the grating, stood a gnome whose duty it\r\nwas to feed the furnace overhead with soft coal, which must be thrown in\r\nat a small door and then pushed up and forward until it lay upon the\r\ngrating where it was consumed. Around this central fire the glass-pots,\r\nten to each furnace, are arranged, their lower surfaces in actual\r\ncontact with it, while the domed roof reverberates the heat upon them\r\nfrom above.\r\n\r\nAll around stood sturdy piers of brick and iron, and low-browed arches,\r\ncrushed, one could not but fancy, out of their original proportions by\r\nthe immense weight they were forced to uphold.\r\n\r\nReturning to the Inferno, Cicerone led the way to a pot which was being\r\nfilled with frit from one of the little covered cars that he had pointed\r\nout in the mixing-room. This process was to be effected gradually, as he\r\nexplained,--a certain portion being at first placed in the heated pot,\r\nand suffered to melt, and then another, until the pot should be full,\r\nwhen the door of it would be put up and closed with cement.\r\n\r\n\"And how long before the frit will be entirely melted?\" asked Monsieur.\r\n\r\n\"From thirty-six to sixty hours. The time varies a good deal with the\r\nseasons, and different sorts of glass take different times to melt. This\r\nflint-glass melts the easiest, and common bottle-glass takes the\r\nlongest. Crown-glass, such as is used for window-panes, comes between\r\nthe two; but that is not made here.\"\r\n\r\n\"And when the glass is sufficiently boiled, what next?\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall see, for here is a pot just opened, and this man with the\r\nlong iron rod, called a pontil, or punty, in his hand, is about to skim\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is there to skim off?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, there will be impurities, of course, however carefully the\r\ningredients are prepared. Some of these sink to the bottom, and some\r\nrise in scum, or, as it is called here, glass-gall, and sometimes\r\nsandiver.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just like broth or society, isn't it, Optima?\" suggested Miselle,\r\naside.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you discover a social pontil, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I have no taste for reforming. What would there be to laugh at in\r\nthe world, if the human sandiver were removed?\"\r\n\r\n\"It might be an improvement to have the gall removed, my dear,\" remarked\r\nOptima, significantly; but Miselle was too busy in watching the skimming\r\nto understand the gentle rebuke.\r\n\r\nThrusting the pontil far into the pot, the workman moved it gently from\r\nside to side, turning it at the same time, until he suddenly withdrew\r\nupon its point a large lump of glowing substance, which he shook off\r\nupon a smooth iron table standing near, called a marver, (that is,\r\n_marbre_,) in size and shape not unlike the largest of a nest of\r\nteapoys. Here the lump of sandiver lay, while through its mass shot rays\r\nof vivid prismatic color, glowing and dying along its surface so\r\nvivaciously that one needs must fancy the salamander no fable, and that\r\nthis death of gorgeous agony was something more than the mere cooling of\r\nan inert mass of matter.\r\n\r\n\"You see how bubbly and streaked that is now?\" broke in the voice of\r\nCicerone upon Miselle's little dream. \"But after standing awhile the air\r\nwill all escape from the pot, leaving the glass smoother, thicker, and\r\ntougher than it is now. Don't you want to look in, before it cools off?\"\r\n\r\nWith a mental protest against the fate of those luckless individuals who\r\nthrew Shadrach, Meschach, and Abednego into the seven-times heated\r\nfurnace, Miselle stooped, and, looking in, uttered a cry of surprise and\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\nIt was the very soul of fire, the essence of light and heat. Above, rose\r\na glowing arch, quivering with an intensity of color, such as fascinates\r\nthe eye of the eagle to the noonday sun. Below, undulated in great oily\r\nwaves a sea of molten matter, throbbing in vivid curves against the\r\nsides of its glowing basin. And arch and wall and heaving waves all\r\nmingled in a pure harmony, an accord, of light too intense for color, or\r\nrather a color so intense as to be nameless in this pale world.\r\n\r\nMiselle knew now how the moth feels who plunges wildly into the flame\r\nthat lures him to his death, and yet fascinates him beyond the power of\r\nresistance. The door was very small, or it might have been already too\r\nlate, when Optima touched the shoulder of this modern Parsee, and\r\nsuggested, calmly,--\r\n\r\n\"If you burn your eyes out here, my dear Miselle, you will be unable to\r\nsee anything else.\"\r\n\r\nThe thought was a kind and sensible one, as, coming from Optima, it\r\ncould not have failed of being; and Miselle stood upright, stared\r\nforlornly about her, and found the world very pale and weak, very cold\r\nand dark.\r\n\r\nWas it to solace her sudden exile from fairy-land, or was it only as a\r\ncustomary courtesy, that an old man, wasted and paled by years of\r\nministration at this fiery shrine, now seized a long, hollow iron rod,\r\ncalled a blow-stick, and, thrusting the smaller end into the pot,\r\nwithdrew a small portion of the glass, and, while retaining it by a\r\nswift twirl, presented the mouth-piece of the tube to Miselle with a\r\ngesture so expressive that she immediately applied her lips to those of\r\nthe blow-stick, and rounded her cheeks to the similitude of those\r\ncorpulent little Breezes whom the old masters are so fond of depicting\r\nattendant upon the flight of their brothers the Winds?\r\n\r\nAh, my little dears, with your straws and soap-suds you will never blow\r\na bubble like that! As it slowly rounded to its perfect sphere, what\r\nsecrets of its birth within that glowing furnace, what mysteries of the\r\npure element whose creation it seemed, flashed in fiery hieroglyph\r\nathwart its surface! A mocking globe, whereon were painted realms that\r\nmay none the less exist, because man's feeble vision has never seen\r\nthem, his fettered mind never imagined them. Who knows? It may have been\r\nthe surface of the sun that was for one instant drawn upon that ball of\r\nliquid fire. Who is to limit the affinities, the subtle reproductions of\r\nNature's grand ideas?\r\n\r\nBut as the wonder culminated, as the glancing rays resolved themselves\r\ninto more positive lines, as the enigma seemed about to offer its own\r\nsolution, the bubble broke, flew into a myriad tiny shards, which, with\r\na tinkling laugh, fell to the grimy pavement, and lay there sparkling\r\nmalicious fun into Miselle's eyes.\r\n\r\nCicerone stooped and gathered some of the fragments. Surely, never was\r\nsubstance so closely allied to shadow. The lightest touch, a breath\r\neven, and they were gone,--and were they caught, it was like the capture\r\nof one of the floating films of a summer morning, glancing brightly to\r\nthe eye, but impalpable to the touch.\r\n\r\nWhen all had looked, the guide slowly closed his hand with a cruel\r\ngripe, and, opening it, threw down a little shower of scintillating\r\ndust, an airy fall of powdered diamonds, lost as they readied the earth,\r\nand that was all.\r\n\r\n\"We're casting some of those Fresnel lanterns to-day. Perhaps the ladies\r\nwould like to see them,\" suggested the pale little old man, and pointed\r\nto a powerful machine with a long lever-handle at the top, which, being\r\nthrown up, showed a heavy iron mould, heated quite hot, and just now\r\nsmoking furiously from a fresh application of kerosene-oil, with which\r\nthe mould is coated before each period of service, much as the housewife\r\nbutters her griddle before each plateful of buckwheat cakes.\r\n\r\nAs the smoke subsided, the old man, who proved a very intelligent as\r\nwell as civil person, thrust his pontil into the pot nearest the press,\r\nand, withdrawing a sufficient quantity of the glass, dropped it squarely\r\ninto the open mould, whose operator, immediately seizing the long\r\nhandle, swung himself from it in a grotesque effort to increase the\r\nnatural gravity of his body, and succeeded in bringing it down with\r\ngreat force. Then, leaning over the lever in a state of complacent\r\nexhaustion, he glared for a moment at the spectators with the calm\r\nsuperiority of one who, having climbed to the summit of knowledge, can\r\nafford to pity the ignorant crowd groping below.\r\n\r\nThe mould being reopened presently displayed a large, heavy lantern,\r\nwhose curiously elaborate flutings and pencillings were, as the\r\nintelligent artisan averred, arranged upon the principle of the famous\r\nFresnel light, whose introduction some years ago marked an epoch in the\r\nhistory of light-houses.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Miss, these little up-and-down marks, that you'd take it were just\r\nput in for fancy,\" said William Greaves, \"have got a patent on 'em, and\r\nno one else could put 'em into a lantern without being prosecuted.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why? What difference do they make?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Miss, every one of them fingerings makes a lens; you see it's just\r\nthe same inside as out, and it sort of _spreads_ the light. That a'n't\r\nthe way to call it, but that's the idea; for the man that got it up was\r\ndown here, and I talked with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what are they for?\"\r\n\r\n\"For ships' lanterns, Ma'am. They take this round lantern, when it's all\r\ndone here, and split it in two halves up and down, and then put one on\r\neach side a vessel's bows just like the lamps on a doctor's gig, and the\r\nbowsprit runs out between just like the horse does in the gig.\"\r\n\r\nAt this juncture a small boy rushed up, and, thrusting a stick into the\r\nstill red-hot lantern, dexterously tilted it up and carried it away to a\r\nfurnace of different construction from the first, into one of whose open\r\ndoors he thrust it, and then returned to wait for another.\r\n\r\nThis furnace, called a flashing-furnace, was round like the first, and\r\nwas fitted with eight or ten doors, from all of which the flames rushed\r\neagerly, and in a very startling fashion.\r\n\r\n\"This is fed constantly with coal-oil,\" expounded Cicerone. \"It is\r\nbrought in pipes, as you see, and drips down inside. These doors are\r\ncalled 'glory-holes'\"----\r\n\r\n\"Aureoles, perhaps,\" suggested Optima, in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\"And the lanterns, or whatever is in hand, are brought here after\r\npressing, and put in to get well heated through again before they are\r\ngiven to the finisher. Fire-polishing they call it. Here you see one\r\njust ready to be taken out.\"\r\n\r\n\"He will drop it,\" cried Miselle, as another boy, wielding a pontil with\r\na lump of melted glass at the end, darted before her, and, pressing this\r\nheated end against the bottom of the lantern, picked it up and carried\r\nit away, over his shoulder, as if he were a stray member of some\r\ntorch-light procession.\r\n\r\n\"Not he! He's too well used to his trade,\" laughed Monsieur. \"Now come\r\nand see the finishing process.\"\r\n\r\nFollowing the steps of the young wide-awake, Miselle saw him deliver the\r\npontil, with the lantern still attached, to a listless individual seated\r\nupon a bench whose long iron arms projected far in front of him, while\r\nan idle pontil lay across them. This the boy snatched up and departed,\r\nwhile the man, suddenly rousing himself, began to roll the new pontil up\r\nand down the arms of his bench with his left hand, while with a pair of\r\ncompasses in his right he carefully gauged the diameter of the revolving\r\nlantern, and then smoothed away its rough-cast edges by means of a\r\nblackened bit of wood, somewhat of the shape, and bearing the name, of a\r\nbattledoor.\r\n\r\nThe finishing over, another stick was thrust inside the lantern, and it\r\nwas separated from the pontil by the application of a bit of cold iron.\r\nIt was then carried to the mouth of a long gallery-like oven, moderately\r\nheated, and fitted with a movable floor, upon which the articles put in\r\nat the hot end were slowly transported through a carefully graduated\r\natmosphere to the cool end at a distance of perhaps a hundred feet, and\r\non their arrival were ready to be packed for transportation.\r\n\r\nThis process was called annealing, and the oven with a movable floor was\r\ntechnically denominated a leer.\r\n\r\n\"Here they are pressing tumblers,\" continued the guide, pointing to a\r\npress of smaller size and power, standing near another door of the same\r\nfurnace. \"They have just had a large order from California, from a\r\nsingle firm, for--how many tumblers did you tell me, Mr. Greaves?\"\r\n\r\n\"Twenty-two thousand dozen, Sir; and we shall have to spring to get them\r\noff at the time set.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nice tumblers they are, too,--just as good as cut, to my mind,\"\r\ncontinued Cicerone, poking with his stick at one of the batch that was\r\nnow being placed in the leer.\r\n\r\nVery nice and clear they were, but not as good as cut to Miselle's mind,\r\nand she remarked,--\r\n\r\n\"It is very easy to feel the difference, if not to see it, between cut\r\nand pressed glass. The latter always has these blunted angles to the\r\nfacets, and has a certain vagueness and want of purpose about it; then\r\nit is not so heavy or so sparkling; there is a certain exhilaration in\r\nthe gleam of cut glass that fits it for purposes to which the other\r\nwould be entirely unsuited. Fancy Champagne in a pressed goblet, or\r\ntuberoses and japonicas in a pressed vase, or attar in a pressed\r\n_flaçon_!\"\r\n\r\n\"Fortunately,\" replied Monsieur, to whom this aside had been addressed,\r\n\"the persons who consider Champagne, japonicas, and attar of roses\r\nnecessaries of life are very well able to provide cut-glass receptacles\r\nfor them. But isn't it worth one's while to be proud of a country where\r\nevery artisan's wife has her tumblers, her goblets, her vases, of\r\npressed glass, certainly, but 'as good, to her mind, as cut,' to quote\r\nour friend? and don't you think it better that twenty-two thousand dozen\r\npressed tumblers should be sold at ten cents apiece than one-third that\r\nnumber of cut ones at thirty cents, leaving all those who cannot pay the\r\nhigher price to drink out of\"----\r\n\r\n\"Clam-shells? Well, perhaps. Equality and the rights of man are very\r\nnice, of course, but I\"----\r\n\r\n\"Like cut glass better,\" retorted Monsieur, laughing, while Miselle\r\nturned a little indignantly to the guide, who was saying,--\r\n\r\n\"The reason the edges have that blunted look is partly because they\r\ncan't be struck as sharp as they can be ground, and then being heated in\r\nthe glory-holes, and again in the leers softens them down a little. In\r\nfact, the very idea of annealing is to make the outside particles of the\r\nglass run together just a very little, so as to fill up the pores as it\r\nwere, and make a smoother surface. If this were not done, it would fly\r\nall to pieces the first time it was put into hot water.\"\r\n\r\n\"The cut glass is not annealed, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, after it is blown it is; and although the grinding takes off\r\npart of the surface, I suppose it fills up the pores at the same time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cut glass is more apt to break in hot water than pressed or simply\r\nblown glass,\" remarked Madame.\r\n\r\n\"And is all cut glass blown in the first place?\" asked Optima.\r\n\r\n\"No, Miss, a good deal of it is pressed and then ground, either wholly\r\nor in part; but this is not so clear or free from waves as the blown.\r\nOut here is a man blowing _liqueur_-glasses. Perhaps you would like to\r\nsee that.\"\r\n\r\nThe idea of blowing a bubble of glass into so intricate a shape, and\r\ntiming the process so that the brittle material should harden only when\r\nit had reached the desired form, struck Miselle's mind as very\r\nincredible; and she followed Cicerone with much curiosity to another\r\nfurnace, where one man, blow-pipe in hand, was dipping up a small\r\nquantity of the liquid glass, and, having blown into it just long enough\r\nto make a stout little bubble, laid the pipe across the iron arms of a\r\nbench, where sat another operator, who immediately began to roll the\r\npipe up and down the arms of his chair, while with a supple iron\r\ninstrument, shaped like sugar-tongs with flattened bowls, he laid hold\r\nof the bubble, and, while elongating it into a tube, brought the lower\r\nextremity first to a point and then to a stem. To the end of this the\r\nassistant now touched his pontil, upon whose end he had taken up a\r\nlittle more glass, and this, being twisted in a ring round the foot of\r\nthe stem, divided from the pontil by a huge pair of scissors,\r\ndexterously shaped with the plyers, and finally smoothed with a\r\nbattledoor, became the foot of the wine-glass. The heated pontil was now\r\napplied exactly to the centre of this foot, the top of the glass divided\r\nfrom the blow-pipe by the application of cold iron, and the whole thrust\r\nfor a few moments into the mouth of the furnace to soften, while the\r\nfirst man laid another pipe with another bubble at the end before the\r\noperator upon the bench, who recommenced the same process.\r\n\r\nThe first glass, meantime, rendered once more ductile by heat, was\r\npassed to another man upon another bench, who, keeping up all the while\r\nthe rotatory motion necessary to preserve the form of the softened\r\nmaterial, smoothed it with the battledoor, gauged it with the compasses,\r\ncoaxed it with the sugar-tongs, and finally trimmed it around the top\r\nwith his scissors as easily as if it had been of paper. It was then\r\ncracked off from the pontil and carried away, a finished _liqueur_-glass\r\nof the tiniest size, to be annealed. After this it might be used in its\r\nsimple condition, or ornamented with engraving, while the bottom of the\r\nfoot, still rough from contact with the pontil, was to be ground,\r\nsmoothed, and then polished.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, how lovely! Look, Miselle, at this ruby glass,\" cried out Optima.\r\n\r\n\"Gorgeous!\" assented Miselle, peeping into a small pot where glowed and\r\nheaved what seemed in very truth a mass of molten rubies.\r\n\r\n\"What _are_ you going to make of this beautiful glass?\" inquired she,\r\nenthusiastically, of a pleasant-looking man who was patiently waiting\r\nfor room to approach his work.\r\n\r\n\"Lamp-globes, Ma'am,\" returned he, sententiously.\r\n\r\n\"Poor Miselle! You thought it would be Cinderella's slipper, at least,\r\ndidn't you?\" laughed Optima. \"But look!\"\r\n\r\nThe man, dipping his pipe, not into the ruby glass, but into an\r\nadjoining pot of fine flint-glass, carefully blew a small globe, and\r\nthen removing the tube from his mouth swung it about in the air for a\r\nfew moments, until it had gained a certain degree of firmness. Then\r\ndipping the bubble into the precious pot of ruby glass, (whose color, as\r\nCicerone mysteriously whispered, was derived from an oxide of gold,) he\r\nwithdrew it coated with the brilliant color, and so softened by the heat\r\nas to be capable of further distension. After gently blowing, until the\r\nshade had reached its proper size, the workman handed it to another,\r\nwho, rolling it upon the iron arms of his bench, made an opening, at the\r\npoint diametrically opposite that attached to the blow-pipe, with the\r\nend of the compasses, and carefully enlarged, gauged, and shaped it, by\r\nmeans of plyers and battledoor.\r\n\r\n\"Pretty soon you will see how they cut the figures out and show the\r\nwhite glass underneath,\" said the guide; but Miselle's attention was at\r\nthis moment engrossed by a series of small explosions, apparently close\r\nat hand, and disagreeably suggestive of the final ascension of the Glass\r\nWorks, inclusive of all the pale men and boys, who might certainly be\r\nsupposed purified by fire, and ready to be released from the furnace of\r\naffliction. Not feeling herself worthy to join this sublimated throng,\r\nMiselle hastily communicated the idea to Optima, and proposed a sudden\r\nretreat, but was smilingly bidden to first consider for a moment the\r\noperations of four workmen close at hand, two of whom, kneeling upon the\r\nground, grasped the handles of two little presses, very like aggravated\r\nbullet-moulds, while the other two, bringing little masses of glass upon\r\nthe ends of their blow-sticks and dropping them carefully into the necks\r\nof the moulds, proceeded to blow through the pipe until the air forced\r\nout a quantity of the glass in the form of a great bubble at the top of\r\nthe mould. The pressure from within increasing still more, this bubble\r\nnecessarily burst with a smart snap, and thus caused the explosive\r\nsounds above referred to. The two casters then scraped away the _débris_\r\nat the top with a bit of stick, and, opening their moulds, disclosed in\r\none a pretty little essence-bottle, which a sharp boy in waiting\r\nimmediately snapped up on the end of a long fork, where he had already\r\nspitted about a dozen more, and carried them away to the leer.\r\n\r\n\"But what are _you_ casting?\" asked Madame, puzzled, as the other\r\nworkman opened his mould and poked its contents out upon a bit of board\r\nheld ready by another sharp boy.\r\n\r\n\"Little inks, Ma'am,\" was the laconic reply; and looking more narrowly\r\nat the tiny object, it proved to be one of the small portable inkstands\r\nused in writing-desks.\r\n\r\nMore explosions at a little distance, and two more men were found to be\r\ncasting, in the same manner, small bottles of opaque white glass,\r\nresembling china, a quality produced by an admixture of bone-dust in the\r\nfrit. These are the bottles dear to manufacturers of pomades, hair-oils,\r\nand various cosmetics, and Miselle turned round a cool one lying upon\r\nthe ground, half-expecting to find a flourishing advertisement of a\r\nnewly discovered _Fontaine d'Or_ upon its back. She did not find it, but\r\nespied instead two pretty little fellows in a corner just beyond, one of\r\nwhom might be twelve and his curly-haired junior not more than ten years\r\nold, who were gravely engaged in blowing chimneys for kerosene lamps,\r\nand quite successfully too, as a large box behind their bench amply\r\nproved,--these alone of all the articles mentioned not requiring to be\r\npassed through the leer.\r\n\r\nA little farther on, a workman, loading his pontil, by repeated\r\ndippings, with a large quantity of glass, dropped the lump into an open\r\nbasin hollowed in the surface of one of the iron tables. It was here\r\nsuffered to cool for some moments, and then, by means of a pontil tipped\r\nwith molten glass, carried away to be fire-polished.\r\n\r\nThis was a lens, such as are used to increase the light in ships'\r\ncabins, staterooms, etc. Another and coarser quality, not lenses, but\r\nsimple disks of greenish glass, about four inches in thickness by twelve\r\nin diameter, were stacked ready for removal at a short distance, and the\r\nwhole association made Miselle so intolerably sea-sick that she sidled\r\naway to watch the manufacture of some decanters, \"sech as is used in\r\nbar-rooms, mostly, Ma'am,\" as the principal workman confided to her.\r\nThese were first moulded in the shape of great tumblers with an\r\nexcessively ugly pattern printed on the sides, then softened in a\r\nglory-hole, and brought to a workman, who, by means of plyers and\r\nbattledoor, elongated and shaped the neck, leaving a queer, ragged lip\r\nat the top. The decanter was then passed to Miselle's confidant, who\r\nstruck off this lip with the edge of his plyers. An attendant then\r\npresented to him a lump of melted glass on the end of his pontil, and\r\nthe workman, deftly twisting it round the neck of his decanter, clipped\r\nit off with a pair of scissors, and proceeded to smooth and shape it by\r\nmeans of the plyers.\r\n\r\nThese decanters were probably to be used in conjunction with some Gothic\r\ngoblets, whose press stood in the immediate vicinity. These were\r\ngreenish in color, thick and unwieldly in shape, and ornamented with\r\nalternate panels of vertical and horizontal stripes.\r\n\r\nMiselle was still lost in contemplation of these goblets when Monsieur\r\napproached.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" exclaimed she, pointing at them,--\"no true patriot should\r\ncongratulate his countrymen upon the plenitude of such articles as that!\r\nFar better for the national growth in art that we should all revert to\r\nclam-shells!\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, then, and see if we cannot find something more to your fancy in\r\nthe cutting-room,\" laughed Monsieur; and Miselle willingly followed\r\nthrough the green yard, and up some stairs to a sunny chamber, or rather\r\nhall, lined on either hand with a row of busy workmen, each seated\r\nbehind a whirring wheel, to which he held the surface of whatever\r\narticle he was engaged in cutting, or rather grinding.\r\n\r\nThese wheels were arranged in a progressive order. The first were of\r\nstone or iron, fed with sand and water, which trickled slowly down upon\r\nthem from a trough overhead. These rapidly cut away the surface of glass\r\npresented to them, leaving it rough and opaque. The article was next\r\npresented to a smooth grindstone, that removed the roughness, and left\r\nthe appearance of fine ground glass.\r\n\r\nThe next process, called polishing, was effected upon a wooden wheel,\r\nfed with pumice or rotten-stone and water, and the final touch was given\r\nby another wooden wheel, and a preparation of tin and lead called\r\nputty-powder.\r\n\r\nThe opacity was now entirely removed, and the facets cut upon the\r\nwine-glass Miselle had principally watched in its progress shone with\r\nthe clear and polished brilliancy characteristic of the finest quality\r\nof cut glass.\r\n\r\nFor very nice work, such as the polishing of chandelier-drops, and\r\narticles of that sort, a leaden wheel, fed with fine rotten-stone and\r\nwater, is employed; but on the occasion referred to, no work of this\r\nnature being in hand, these wheels were not used.\r\n\r\nOther wheels, consisting of a simple disk of iron, not unlike a circular\r\nsaw without any teeth, were used for cutting those narrow vertical\r\nlines, technically known as fingering, familiar to those so happy as to\r\nhave had careful grandmothers, and to have inherited their decanters and\r\nwine-glasses. The revival of this style, like that of the rich old\r\npattern in plate known as the \"Mayflower,\" is a compliment just now paid\r\nby the present generation to the taste of the past, and Miselle was\r\nshown some beautiful specimens of the \"latest mode, Ma'am,\" that awoke\r\nmelancholy reminiscences of the shattered idols of her youth.\r\n\r\n\"Here are our friends, the ruby lampshades, again,\" remarked Optima.\r\n\r\n\"And now you will see how the transparent figures are made upon them,\"\r\nsuggested Cicerone, pointing to a workman, who, with a pile of the\r\nruby-coated globes beside him, was painting circles upon one of them\r\nwith some yellowish pigment. The globe then being held to one of the\r\nrough wheels, the thin shell of red glass within these circles was\r\nground away, leaving it white, but opaque. The globe then passed through\r\nthe processes of smooth grinding and polishing, above described, until\r\nthe pattern was finally developed in clear transparent medallions.\r\n\r\nA very beautiful article in colored glass was a Hock decanter of an\r\nexquisite antique pattern in green glass, wreathed with a grape-vine,\r\nwhose leaves and stems were transparent, while the clusters of grapes\r\nwere left opaque by the omission of the polishing process.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the noisy cutting-room was a small chamber, hardly more\r\nthan a closet, called the engraving-room, and bearing the same relation\r\nto the former as the crypt where the cellarer jealously stores his Tokay\r\nfor the palate of a Kaiser holds to the acres of arches where lies the\r\n_vin ordinaire_.\r\n\r\nHere, in the full light of ample windows, before a high bench, over\r\nwhich revolved with incredible rapidity a half-dozen small copper disks\r\nfed with fine emery and oil, stood as many earnest-looking men, not\r\nartisans, but artists, each of whom, vaguely guided by a design lightly\r\nsketched upon the article under his hands, was developing it with an\r\nease and skill really beautiful to contemplate. Intricate arabesques,\r\nsingle flowers of perfect grace, or rare groups of bloom, piles of\r\nfruit, or spirited animal-life, all grew between the whirring copper\r\nwheel and the nice hand, whose slightest turn or pressure had a meaning\r\nand a just result.\r\n\r\nMiselle watched the engraving of an intricate cipher beneath the\r\nfantastic crest of some wealthy epicurean, who had ordered a complete\r\ndessert-service of such charming forms and graceful designs that envy of\r\nhis taste, if not of his possessions, became a positive duty.\r\n\r\n\"Is there any limit to the range of your subjects?\" asked Miselle, as\r\nthe artist added the last graceful curve to the griffin's tail, and\r\ncontemplated his finished work with quiet complacency.\r\n\r\n\"There may be, but I never found it. Whatever a pencil can draw this\r\nwheel can cut,\" said he, with such a smile as Gottschalk might assume in\r\nanswering the query as to whether the score could be written that he\r\ncould not render.\r\n\r\nHaving now witnessed all the processes of glass-manufacture to be seen\r\nat this time and place,[26] the party were conducted to the show-room,\r\npassing on the way through a room where a number of young women were\r\nengaged in painting and gilding vases, spoon-holders, lamps, and various\r\nother articles in plain and colored glass. The colors used showed, for\r\nthe most part, but a very faint resemblance to the tints they were\r\nintended to produce, and the gold appeared like a dingy brown paint;\r\nbut, as was explained by Cicerone, these-colors were to be fixed by\r\nburning, or rather melting them into the surface of the glass, and this\r\nprocess would at the same time evolve their true colors and brilliancy,\r\nboth of paint and gilding.\r\n\r\nIn the next room to this, several workmen were busy in fitting the metal\r\ntrimmings to such articles as lamps, lanterns, castors,\r\nmolasses-pitchers, and the like.\r\n\r\nOne chirruping old man insisted upon mounting an immensely ugly blue and\r\nyellow lamp upon a brass foot for the edification of his visitors, and\r\nwhen this was over, exhibited some opaque white glass stands for other\r\nlamps, which, as he fondly remarked, \"would be took for marble\r\nanyw'eres.\"\r\n\r\nThe show-room was a long, airy hall, with a row of tables on either\r\nhand, covered with glass, whose icy glitter and lack of color gave a\r\ndeliciously cool aspect to the whole place. Glass in every graceful form\r\nand design, some heavy and crystalline, enriched with ornate workmanship\r\nby cutter and engraver, some delicate and fragile as a soap-bubble;\r\nhock-glasses as green and lucent as sea-water, and with an edge not too\r\nthick to part the lips of Titania; glasses of amber, that should turn\r\npale Johannisberger to the true _vino d'oro_; glasses of glowing ruby\r\ntint, than which Bohemia sends us nothing finer; vases and goblets as\r\nrare in form and wrought as skilfully as those two cups that Nero bought\r\nfor six thousand sestertii; medallions bearing in _intaglio_ portraits\r\nof distinguished men as clearly and unmistakably cut as on coin or\r\ncameo; whole services of glass, more beautiful and almost as valuable as\r\nservices of plate; plumes of spun glass as fine and sheeny as softest\r\nsilk; toys and scientific playthings; objects of wonder, admiration, and\r\ncuriosity: all these were to be seen crowded upon these long, white\r\ntables in the cool hall, where the wind, sweeping gently through,\r\nbrought the smell of the rising tide, and the sound of its waves upon\r\nthe shore.\r\n\r\nHere, too, was a man who knew the story, not only of the glass lying\r\nbeneath his hand to-day, but of all the glass the world has known, from\r\nthe colored beads inhumed with the Pharaonic princesses to the ruby\r\nsalver he so fondly fingered as he talked.\r\n\r\nHe spoke of the glazed windows of Pompeii; of the \"excellent portrait\"\r\nof the Emperor Constantine VII. painted, A. D. 949, upon a\r\nchurch-window. He recounted the ancient story of the Phoenicians, who,\r\nlanding at the mouth of the river, brought from their ships lumps of\r\nsoda, and, laying them upon the sand as a support for their dinner-pot,\r\nfound when they had done lumps of glass among the ashes, and so\r\nrediscovered the lost art of glass-making; but to this he added, with a\r\ndubious smile,--\r\n\r\n\"Fire must have been hotter in those days than now. We could never melt\r\nsand in that fashion now.\"\r\n\r\nThen coming to window-glass, he clearly described the process of its\r\nmanufacture, although confessing he had never been engaged in it, and\r\nfrom this Miselle, with a word, launched him into the glowing sea of\r\nmediæval painted windows, and the wellnigh forgotten glories of their\r\nmanufacture.\r\n\r\n\"There is hardly one of them left that I have not seen,\" said he,--\"from\r\nthe old heathen temples of the East, that the Christians converted to\r\ntheir own use, and, while they burned the idols, spared the windows,\r\nwhich they had sense to remember they could never reproduce, to the\r\ngloomy purple-shadowed things they put up so much in England and the\r\nUnited States at the present day, forgetting, as it would seem, that the\r\nfirst idea of a window is to let the light through.\r\n\r\n\"But one of the finest works of modern times was the great\r\ntournament-window, first exhibited in London in 1820. I was a young\r\nfellow then, hardly twenty indeed, and with very little money to spare\r\nfor sight-seeing. But from the day I first heard of it, until five years\r\nafterward, when I saw it, I never wavered in my determination to go\r\nabroad and look at that window, as well as all the others I had heard so\r\nmuch of.\r\n\r\n\"It was a beautiful thing really, Ma'am, measuring eighteen by\r\ntwenty-four feet, and made up of three hundred and fifty pieces of glass\r\nset in metal astragals, so cleverly worked into the shadows that the\r\nwhole affair appeared like one piece. It represented the passage-of-arms\r\nbetween Henry VIII., of England, and Francis I., of France, held at\r\nArdres, June 25, 1520, and of the hundred figures shown, over forty were\r\nportraits. Among these were the two queens, Katharine of England, and\r\nClaude of France, Anne Boleyn, and Cardinal Wolsey, with a great many\r\nother distinguished persons.\"\r\n\r\n\"And this window, where is it now?\" asked Optima.\r\n\r\n\"Destroyed by fire, June 30, 1832,\" he replied, with the mournful awe of\r\none giving the date of some terrible human disaster.\r\n\r\n\"How many glass-factories like this are there in the country?\" asked\r\nMonsieur, reverting to the practical view of the matter under\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\"Flint-glass works, Sir? There are three in South Boston, two in East\r\nCambridge, and one here in Sandwich. That is for Massachusetts alone.\r\nThen there are two in Brooklyn, New York, one in Jersey City, and two in\r\nPhiladelphia. These are all flint-glass, you understand; the principal\r\nwindow-glass factories are in the southern part of New Jersey, and in\r\nPittsfield, Pennsylvania. Then there is a flourishing plate-glass\r\nfactory in Lenox, in this State, and another in New York. But the old\r\nBay State, Sir, has led the van in this enterprise ever since 1780, when\r\nRobert Hewes, of Boston, opened the first glass-factory in the country\r\nat Temple, New Hampshire. His workmen were all Hessians or Wallachians\r\nwho had deserted from the British army. They had learned the art in\r\ntheir own country, and were the best men he could have found for his\r\npurpose at that time; but they were a disorderly set, and, finally, one\r\nof the furnace-men got drunk, and burnt down the works in the night.\r\nHewes presented a circular plate of glass, as a specimen of his\r\nmanufacture, to Harvard College, and I believe they have it now. It was\r\na very good article of glass, although a little greenish in color, and\r\nnot quite so clear as we get it now.\r\n\r\n\"After he was burnt out, one Lint set up some glass-works in Boston\r\nabout 1800. They were not successful for a while, but about 1802 or 1803\r\nthey got fairly started, and have kept ahead ever since.\"\r\n\r\n\"Four o'clock, my dear,\" remarked Madame, softly, to Monsieur, and\r\nCicerone, who had fidgeted awfully all through the little lecture,\r\nbrightened perceptibly, and rubbed his hands contentedly, as, with many\r\nthanks to the courteous superintendent, and a last glance at the\r\nglittering wonders of his charge, the party descended once more to the\r\ngreen yard, and crossed it to the principal gate.\r\n\r\n\"One minute, Optima. Do come and look at the engine in here!\" cried\r\nMiselle, dragging her reluctant friend into a long, narrow den, almost\r\nfilled by a black monster with shining brass ornaments, who slid his\r\niron arms backward and forward, backward and forward, in a steady,\r\nremorseless manner, highly suggestive of what he would do, had he fists\r\nat the end of them, and all the world within reach of their swing. A\r\nsickish smell of heated oil pervaded the apartment, although everything\r\nwas as clean and bright as hands could make it.\r\n\r\nWith the foolish daring characteristic of her sex, Miselle stole out a\r\nfinger to touch the remorseless arm as it shot outward, but Optima\r\ndetected and arrested the movement, with a grave \"For shame!\" and at the\r\nsame moment a man suddenly emerged from behind the body of the monster,\r\nand, approaching the venturous intruder, bawled in her ear,--\r\n\r\n\"'Twould take off a man's head, Miss, as easy as a pipe-stem!\"\r\n\r\nMiselle nodded, without attempting a defence, and the man added\r\npresently,--\r\n\r\n\"'Undred 'oss power, Miss. Drives all the works.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do come out, Miselle! I shall go crazy in another minute!\" screamed\r\nOptima; and the two young women hastened to overtake the rest of the\r\nparty, who were already in the street.\r\n\r\nGypsy and Fanny, who had better used their four hours of rest than in\r\nexploring glass-works, stood ready-harnessed before the door of the\r\nCentral Hotel when the sight-seers returned thither, and in a few\r\nmoments the ladies were handed to their seats, Monsieur gathered up the\r\nreins, and Tom having \"given them their heads,\" the spirited little nags\r\ntossed the precious gifts into the air, and took the road at a pace that\r\nneeded only moderating to make it the perfection of exhilarating motion.\r\n\r\nWords are all very well in their way, but they fail wofully when a\r\nperson has really anything to say.\r\n\r\nFor instance, where are the phrases to describe that sunset sky, so\r\nclear and blue overhead that one felt it was only the scant range of\r\nhuman vision that hid the unveiled heavenly glories beyond the arch,--so\r\ngorgeous at the horizon, where it met the opalescent sea,--so rosy in\r\nthe east, where, like a great golden shield, stood the moon gazing\r\nacross the world triumphantly at the sinking sun,--the dewy freshness\r\nof the woods, where lingered the intoxicating perfumes distilled by the\r\nblazing noontide from fir and spruce,--the jubilant chorus of birds,\r\ndying strain by strain, until the melancholy whippoorwill grieved alone\r\nin his woodland solitude?\r\n\r\nOn by the lonely farms and unlighted cabins, by the bare, bleak moors,\r\nwhere the night-wind came rolling softly up to look at the\r\ntravellers,--on till the low, broad sea opened out the view, and came\r\nsobbing up on the beach, wailing at its own cruel deeds,--on beneath the\r\ncloudless night, upon whose front blazed Orion and the Pleiades,--on\r\nuntil the scene had wrought its charm, and the frequent speech fell to\r\nscattered words, to silent thought, to passionate feeling, where\r\nswelling heart and dim eyes alone uttered the soul's response to earth's\r\nperfect beauty, God's perfect goodness.\r\n\r\nAnd so ever on, until the twinkling lights in the curve of the bay\r\nshowed where the weary Pilgrims had set foot on shore, in that black,\r\nbitter December weather, and planted the seed that has borne blossoms\r\nand fruits unnumbered, and shall yet bear more and more for centuries to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nAnd through the quiet suburb, and across the brook, and up the\r\nvillage-street, to the happy and hospitable home, where brilliant lights\r\nand a sparkling tea-service waited to welcome the weary, but\r\nwell-pleased _voyageurs_.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[25] \"Cullet\" is the waste of the glass-room. The superfluous material\r\ntaken up on the pontil, and the shards of articles broken in process of\r\nmanufacture. The ingenious reader will thus interpret the heading of\r\nthis paper.\r\n\r\n[26] It is proper to state that Miselle subsequently visited the\r\nNew-England Glass Company's Works in East Cambridge, Massachusetts, and,\r\nfinding the method of manufacture nearly identical with that at\r\nSandwich, has, for convenience' sake, incorporated her observations\r\nthere with this account of her visit to the latter place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT WILL BECOME OF THEM?\r\n\r\nA STORY IN TWO PARTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nGentleman Bill, full of confidence in his powers of persuasion,\r\nadvances, to add the weight of his respectability to his parent's\r\nremonstrance.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, Mr. Frisbie,\"--politely lifting his hat.\r\n\r\n\"Hey?\" says Frisbie, sarcastic.--\"Look at his insolence, Stephen!\"\r\n\r\n\"I sincerely trust, Sir,\" begins Bill, \"that you will reconsider your\r\ndetermination, Sir\"----\r\n\r\n\"Shall I fetch him a cut with the hosswhip?\" whispers Stephen, loud\r\nenough for the stalwart young black to hear.\r\n\r\n\"You can fetch him a cut with the hosswhip, if you like,\" Bill answers\r\nfor Mr. Frisbie, with fire blazing upon his polite face. \"But, Sir, in\r\ncase you do, Sir, I shall take it upon myself to teach you better\r\nmanners than to insult a gentleman conferring with your master, Sir!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha, ha, ha!\" roared Mr. Frisbie. \"You've got it, Stephen!\"\r\n\r\nThe whip trembled in Stephen's angry hand, but the strapping young negro\r\nlooked so cool and wicked, standing there, that he wisely forbore to\r\nstrike.\r\n\r\n\"I am sure, Sir,\" Bill addresses the landlord, \"you are too humane a\r\nperson\"----\r\n\r\n\"No, I a'n't,\" says the florid Frisbie. \"I know what you're going to\r\nsay; but it's no use. You can't work upon my feelings; I a'n't one of\r\nyour soft kind.--Drive up to the door, Stephen.\"\r\n\r\nStephen is very glad to start the horse suddenly and graze Gentleman\r\nBill's knee with the wheel-hub. Bill steps back a pace, and follows him\r\nwith the smiting look of one who treasures up wrath. You'd better be\r\ncareful, Stephen, let me tell you!\r\n\r\nJoe stands holding the door open, and Mr. Frisbie looks in. There, to\r\nhis astonishment, he sees the women washing clothes as unconcernedly as\r\nif nothing unusual was about to occur. He jumps to the ground, heated\r\nwith passion.\r\n\r\n\"Ho, here!\" he shouts in at the door; \"don't you see the house is coming\r\ndown?\"\r\n\r\nUpon which the deaf old grandfather rises in his corner, and pulls off\r\nhis cap, with the usual salutation, \"Sarvant, Sah,\" etc., and sitting\r\ndown again, relapses into a doze immediately.\r\n\r\nFrisbie is furious. \"What you 'bout here?\" he cries, in an alarming\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\"Bless you, Sir,\" answers the old woman, over a tub, \"don't you see?\r\nWe's doon' a little washin', Sir. Didn't you never see nobody wash\r\nafore?\" And she proceeds with her rubbing.\r\n\r\n\"The house will be tumbling on you in ten minutes!\"\r\n\r\n\"You think so? Now I don't, Mr. Frisbie! This 'ere house a'n't gwine to\r\ntumble down this mornin', I know. The Lord 'll look out for that, I\r\nguess. Look o' these 'ere childern! look o' me! look o' my ole father\r\nthere, more'n a hunderd year ole! What's a-gwine to 'come on us all, if\r\nyou pull the house down? Can't git another right away; no team to tote\r\nour things off with; an' how 'n the world we can do 'thout no house this\r\nwinter I can't see. So I've jes' concluded to trust the Lord, an' git\r\nout my washin'.\" Rub, rub, rub!\r\n\r\nFrisbie grows purple. \"Are you fools?\" he inquires.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, _I_ am! I'm Fessenden's.\" And the honest, staring youth comes\r\nforward to see what is wanted.\r\n\r\nThis unexpected response rather pricks the wind-bag of the man's zeal.\r\nHe looks curiously at the boy, who follows him out of the house.\r\n\r\n\"Stephen, did you ever see that fellow before?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Sir; he's the one come to our house Saturday night, and I showed\r\nround to the Judge's.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you the fellow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" says Fessenden's. \"There wouldn't any of you let me into your\r\nhouses, neither!\"\r\n\r\n\"Wouldn't the people I sent you to let you in?\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hear that, Stephen! your philanthropical Gingerford!--And what did you\r\ndo?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't do nothin',--only laid down to die, I did.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you didn't die, did you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No! This man he come along, and brought me here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here? to the niggers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes! You wouldn't have me, so they took me, and dried me, and fed\r\nme,--good folks, niggers!\" Fessenden's bore this simple testimony.\r\n\r\nWhat is it makes the Frisbie color heighten so? Is it Gentleman Bill's\r\nquiet smile, as he stands by and hears this conversation?\r\n\r\n\"And you have been here ever since?\" says the man, in a humbler key, and\r\nwith a milder look, than before.\r\n\r\n\"Yes! It's a r'al good place!\" says the youth.\r\n\r\n\"But a'n't you ashamed to live with niggers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ashamed? What for? Nobody else was good to me. But they was good to me.\r\nI a'n't ashamed.\"\r\n\r\nThe Frisbie color heightens more and more. He looks at that wretched\r\ndwelling,--he glances aside at Mr. Williams, that coal-black Christian,\r\nof sad and resigned demeanor, waiting ruefully to see the roof torn\r\noff,--the only roof that had afforded shelter to the perishing outcast.\r\nMr. Frisbie is not one of the \"soft kind,\" but he feels the prick of\r\nconscience in his heart.\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you go to the poor-house? Didn't anybody tell you to?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that's what they said. But nobody showed me the way, and I\r\ncouldn't find it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where did you come from? Who are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fessenden's.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is Fessenden?\"\r\n\r\n\"The man that owns me. But he whipped me and shet me up, and I wouldn't\r\nstay.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where does he live?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't know. Away off.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd better go back to him, hadn't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No! I like these folks. Best folks I ever seen!\" avers the earnest\r\nyouth.\r\n\r\nFlush and confusion are in the rich man's face. He turns up an uneasy\r\nglance at Adsly's men, already on the roof; then coughs, and says to\r\nStephen,--\r\n\r\n\"This is interesting!\"\r\n\r\n\"Very,\" says Stephen.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you remember, _I_ was going to make some provision for this\r\nfellow,--I'd have seen him safe in the almshouse, if nothing more,--but\r\nyou suggested Gingerford's.\"\r\n\r\n\"I supposed Gingerford would be delighted to take him in,\" grins\r\nStephen.\r\n\r\n\"Instead of that, he turns him out in the storm! Did you ever hear of\r\nsuch sham philanthropy? By George!\" cries Frisbie, in his indignation\r\nagainst the Judge, \"there's more real philanthropy in these\r\nniggers\"----checking himself, and glancing again at the workmen on the\r\nroof.\r\n\r\n\"What's philanthropy?\" asks Fessenden's. \"Is that what you're tearin'\r\ntheir house down for? I'm sorry!\"\r\n\r\nFrisbie is flustered. He is ashamed of appearing \"soft.\" He wishes\r\nheartily to be well rid of the niggers. But something in his own heart\r\nrebels against the course he has taken to eject them.\r\n\r\n\"Just hold on there a minute, Adsly!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay!\" says Adsly. And the work stops.\r\n\r\n\"Now what do I do this for?\" exclaims Frisbie, vexed at himself the\r\ninstant he has spoken. And he frowns, and blows his nose furiously.\r\n\"It's because I am too good-natured, altogether!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, Sir,--I beg your pardon!\" says Mr. Williams, his heart all\r\naglow with gratitude. \"To be kind and merciful to the poor, that isn't\r\nto be too good-natured, Sir!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well! I a'n't one of your milk-and-water sort. Look at such a man\r\nas Gingerford, for example! But I guess, come case in hand, you'll find\r\nas much genuine humanity in me, Adsly, as in them that profess so much.\r\nWait till to-morrow before you knock the old shell to pieces. I'll give\r\n'em another day. And in the mean time, boy,\" turning to Fessenden's,\r\n\"you must find you another home. Either go back to your guardian, or\r\nI'll send you over to the almshouse. These people can't keep you, for\r\nthey'll have no house in these parts to keep themselves in.\"\r\n\r\n\"So?\" says Fessenden's. \"They kep' me when they had a house, and I'll\r\nstay with them when they haven't got any.\"\r\n\r\nSomething in the case of this unfortunate stripling interested Frisbie.\r\nHis devotion to his new friends was so sincere, and so simply expressed,\r\nthat the robust, well-fed man was almost touched by it.\r\n\r\n\"I vow, it's a queer case, Stephen! What do you think of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think\"----said the joker.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think? Out with it!\"\r\n\r\n\"You own that vacant lot opposite Gingerford's?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; what of that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think, then, instead of pulling the house down, I'd just move it over\r\nthere, niggers and all\"----\r\n\r\n\"And set it opposite the Judge's!\" exclaims Frisbie, catching gleefully\r\nat the idea.\r\n\r\n\"Exactly,\" says Stephen; \"and give him enough of niggers for one while.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll do it!--Adsly! Adsly! See here, Adsly! Do you suppose this old box\r\ncan be moved?\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess so. 'T a'n't very large. Ruther think the frame'll hold\r\ntogether.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you undertake the job?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, I never moved a house. There's Cap'en Slade, he moves houses. He's\r\ngot all the tackle for it, and I ha'n't. I suppose I can git him, if\r\nyou want me to see to the job.\"\r\n\r\nAgreed! It did not take Frisbie long to decide. It was such a tremendous\r\njoke! A nest of niggers under the dainty Gingerford nose! ho, ho! Whip\r\nup, Stephen! And the red and puffy face, redder and puffier still with\r\nimmense fun, rode off.\r\n\r\nAdsly and his men disappeared also, to return with Cap'en Slade and his\r\ntackle on the morrow. Then Joe began to dance and scream like a little\r\ndevil.\r\n\r\n\"Have a ride! have a ride! Oh, mammy! they're gunter snake th' ole house\r\nthrough the village to-morrer, an' we're all gunter have a ride! free\r\ngratis for nothin'! 'thout payin' for 't neither! A'n't we, Bill?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Williams sits right down, overcome by the surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Now I want to know if that 'ere 's so!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what't looks like now,\" says Mr. Williams. \"We're goin' to be\r\nsot opposite Mr. Gingerford's.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Ristocratic!\" cries Joe, putting on airs. \"That's what'll tickle\r\nBill!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, laws!\" exclaims Mrs. Williams, with humorous sadness,--\"what a show\r\nth' ole cabin'll make, stuck down there 'mongst all them fine housen!\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know's I quite like the notion,\" says her husband, with a\r\ngood-natured expansion of his serious features. \"I'm 'fraid we sha'n't\r\nbe welcome neighbors down there. 'T a'n't so much out o' kindness to us\r\nas it is out o' spite to the Gingerfords, that the house is to be moved\r\ninstid o' tore down.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the glory of the Lord! Even the wrath of man shall praise Him!\"\r\nutters the old grandmother, devoutly.\r\n\r\n\"Won't it be jimmy?\" crows Joe. \"He's a jolly ole brick, that Frisbie!\r\nI'm a-gunter set straddle on the ridge-pole, an' carry a flag. Hooray!\"\r\n\r\n\"I consider that the situation will be very much preferable to this,\"\r\nobserves Gentleman Bill, polishing his hat with his coat-sleeve. \"Better\r\nquarter of the town; more central; eligible locality for establishing a\r\ntailor-shop.\"\r\n\r\n\"Legible comicality for stablin' a shailor-top!\" stammers Joe, mimicking\r\nhis brother.\r\n\r\nUpon which Bill--as he sometimes did, when excited--elapsed into the\r\nvulgar, but expressive idiom of the family. \"Shet yer head, can't ye?\"\r\nAnd he lifted a hand, with intent to clap it smartly upon the part the\r\nocclusion of which was desirable.\r\n\r\nJoe shrieked, and fled.\r\n\r\n\"No quarrellin' on a 'casion like this!\" interposes the old woman,\r\ncovering the boy's retreat. \"This 'ere's a time for joy and thanks, an'\r\nnuffin' else. Bless the Lord, I knowed He'd keep an eye on to th' ole\r\nhouse. Didn't I tell ye that boy'd bring us good luck? It's all on his\r\naccount the house a'n't tore down, an' I consider it a mighty Providence\r\nfrom fust to last. Wasn't I right, when I said I guessed I'd have faith,\r\nan' git the washin' out? Bless the Lord, I could cry!\"\r\n\r\nAnd cry she did, with a fulness of heart which, I think, might possibly\r\nhave convinced even the jocund Frisbie that there was something better\r\nthan an old, worn-out, spiteful jest in the resolution he had taken to\r\nhave the house moved, instead of razed.\r\n\r\nAnd now the deaf old patriarch in the corner-became suddenly aware that\r\nsomething exciting was going forward; but being unable clearly to\r\ncomprehend what, and chancing to see Fessenden's coming in, he gave\r\nexpression to his exuberant emotions by rising, and shaking the lad's\r\npassive hand, with the usual highly polite salutation.\r\n\r\n\"Tell him we're all a-gunter have a ride,\" said Joe.\r\n\r\nBut as Fessenden's couldn't tell him loud enough, Joe screamed the news.\r\n\r\n\"Say?\" asked the old man, raising a feeble hand to his ear, and stooping\r\nand smiling.\r\n\r\n\"Put th' ole house on wheels, an' dror it!\" shrieked Joe.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes!\" chuckled the old man. \"I remember! Six hills in a row.\r\nBusters!\"--looking wonderfully knowing, and, with feeble forefinger\r\nraised, nodding and winking at his great-grandchild,--as it were across\r\nthe slim gulf of a hundred years which divided the gleeful boyhood of\r\nJoe from the second childhood of the ancient dreamer.\r\n\r\nThe next day came Adsly and his men again, with Cap'en Slade and his\r\ntackle, and several yokes of oxen with drivers. Levers and screws moved\r\nthe house from its foundations, and it was launched upon rollers. Then,\r\nprogress! Then, sensation in Timberville! Some said it was Noah's ark,\r\nsailing down the street. The household furniture of the patriarch was\r\nmostly left on board the antique craft, but Noah and his family followed\r\non foot. They took their live stock with them,--cow and calf, and\r\npoultry and pig. Joe and his great-grandfather carried each a pair of\r\npullets, in their hands. Gentleman Bill drove the pig, with a rope tied\r\nto his (piggy's) leg. Mr. Williams transported more poultry,--turkeys\r\nand hens, in two great flopping clusters, slung over his shoulder, with\r\ntheir heads down. The women bore crockery and other frangible articles,\r\nand helped Fessenden's drive the cow. A picturesque procession, not\r\nnoiseless! The bosses shouted to the men, the drivers shouted to the\r\noxen, loud groaned the beams of the ark, the cow lowed, the calf bawled,\r\ngreat was the squawking and squealing!\r\n\r\nGentleman Bill was sick of the business before they had gone half-way.\r\nHe wished he had stayed in the shop, instead of coming over to help the\r\nfamily, and make himself ridiculous. There was not much pleasure in\r\ndriving that stout young porker. Many a sharp jerk lamed the hand that\r\nheld the rope that restrained the leg that piggy wanted to run with.\r\nBesides, (as I believe swine and some other folks invariably do under\r\nthe like circumstances,) piggy always tried to run in the wrong\r\ndirection. To add to Gentleman Bill's annoyance, spectators soon became\r\nnumerous, and witty suggestions were not wanting.\r\n\r\n\"Take him up in your arms,\" said somebody.\r\n\r\n\"Take advantage of his contrariness, and try to drive him 't other way,\"\r\nsaid somebody else.\r\n\r\n\"Ride him,\" proposed a third.\r\n\r\n\"Make a whistle of his tail, an' blow it, an' he'll foller ye!\" screamed\r\na bright school-boy.\r\n\r\n\"Stick some of yer tailor's needles into him!\" \"Sew him up in a sack,\r\nand shoulder him!\" \"Take up his hind-legs, and push him like a\r\nwheelbarrer!\" And so forth, and so forth, till Bill was in a fearful\r\nsweat and rage, partly with the pig, but chiefly with the uncivil\r\nmultitude.\r\n\r\n\"Ruther carry me on your back, some rainy night, hadn't ye?\" said\r\nFessenden's, in all simplicity, perceiving his distress.\r\n\r\n\"You didn't excruciate my wrist so like time!\" groaned Bill. And what\r\nwas more, darkness covered that other memorable journey.\r\n\r\nAs for Joe, he liked it. Though he was not allowed to ride the\r\nridge-pole and wave a flag through the village, as he proposed, he had\r\nplenty of fun on foot. He went swinging his chickens, and frequently\r\npinching them to make them musical. The laughter of the lookers-on\r\ndidn't trouble him in the least; for he could laugh louder than any. But\r\nhis sisters were ashamed, and Mr. Williams looked grave; for they were,\r\nactually, human! and I suppose they didn't like to be jeered at, and\r\ncalled a swarm of niggers, any more than you or I would.\r\n\r\nSo the journey was accomplished; and the stupendous joke of Frisbie's\r\nwas achieved. Conceive Mrs. Gingerford's wonder, when she beheld the ark\r\napproaching! Fancy her feelings, when she saw it towed up and moored in\r\nfront of her own door,--the whole tribe of Noah, lowing cow, bawling\r\ncalf, squawking poultry, and squealing pig, and so forth, and so forth,\r\naccompanying! This, then, was the meaning of the masons at work over\r\nthere since yesterday. They had been preparing the new foundations on\r\nwhich the old house was to rest. So the stunning truth broke upon her:\r\nniggers for neighbors! What had she done to merit such a dispensation?\r\n\r\nWhat done, unhappy lady? Your own act has drawn down upon you this\r\nretribution. You yourself have done quite as much towards bringing that\r\nqueer craft along-side as yonder panting and lolling oxen. They are but\r\nthe brute instruments, while you have been a moral agent in the matter.\r\nOne word, uttered by you three nights ago, has had the terrible magic in\r\nit to summon forth from the mysterious womb of events this extraordinary\r\nprocession. Had but a different word been spoken, it would have proved\r\nequally magical, though we might never have known it: that breath by\r\nyour delicate lips would have blown back these horrible shadows; and\r\ninstead of all this din and confusion of house-hauling, we should have\r\nhad silence this day in the streets of Timberville. You don't see it? In\r\nplain phrase, then, understand: you took not in the stranger at your\r\ngate; but he found refuge with these blacks; and because they showed\r\nmercy unto him, the sword of Frisbie's wrath was turned aside from them,\r\nand, edged by Stephen's witty jest, directed against you and yours.\r\nHence this interesting scene which you look down upon from your windows,\r\nat the beautiful hour of sunset, which you love. And, oh, to think of\r\nit! between your chamber and those golden sunsets that negro hut and\r\nthose negroes will always be henceforth!\r\n\r\nNow don't you wish; Madam, you had had compassion on the wayfarer? But\r\nwe will not mock at your calamity. You did precisely what any of us\r\nwould have been only too apt to do in your place. You told the simple\r\ntruth, when you said you didn't want the ragged wretch in your house.\r\nAnd what person of refinement, I'd like to know, would have wanted him?\r\nFor, say what you will, it is a most disagreeable thing to admit\r\ndownright dirty vagabonds into our elegant dwellings. And dangerous,\r\nbesides; for they might murder us in the night,--or steal something! Oh,\r\nwe fastidious and fearful! where is our charity? where is the heart of\r\ntrust? There was of old a Divine Man, who had not where to lay his\r\nhead,--whom the wise of those days scoffed at as a crazy fellow,--whom\r\nrespectable people shunned,--who made himself the companion of the poor,\r\nthe comforter of the distressed, the helper of those in trouble, and the\r\nhealer of diseases;--who shrank neither from the man or woman of sin,\r\nnor from the loathsome leper, nor from sorrow and death for our\r\nsakes,--whose gospel we now profess to live by, and----\r\n\r\nBut let us not be \"soft.\" We are reasonably Christian, we hope; and it\r\nshows low breeding to be ultra. (Was the Carpenter's Son low-bred?)\r\n\r\nAnd now the Judge rides home in the dusk of the December day. It is\r\nstill light enough, however, for him to see that Frisbie's vacant lot\r\nhas been made an Ararat of; and he could hear the Noachian noises, were\r\nit ever so dark. The awful jest bursts upon him; he hears the screaming\r\nof the bomb-shell, then the explosion. But the mind of this man is (so\r\nto speak) casemated. It is a shock,--but he never once loses his\r\nself-possession. His quick perception detects Friend Frisbie behind the\r\ngun; and he smiles with his intelligent, fine-cut face. Shall malice\r\nhave the pleasure of knowing that the shot has told? Our orator is too\r\nsagacious for that. There is never any use in being angry: that is one\r\nof his maxims. Therefore, if he feels any chagrin, he will smother it.\r\nIf there is a storm within, the world shall see only the rainbow, that\r\nradiant smile of his. Cool is Gingerford! He has seized the subject\r\ninstantly, and calculated all its bearings. He is a man to make the best\r\nof it; and even the bitterness which is in it shall, if possible, bear\r\nhim some wholesome drink. To school his mind to patience,--to practise\r\ndaily the philanthropy he teaches,--this will be much; and already his\r\nheart is humbled and warmed. And who knows,--for, with all his\r\nsincerity and aspiration, he has an eye to temporal uses,--who knows but\r\nthis stumbling-block an enemy has placed in his way may prove the\r\nstepping-stone of his ambition?\r\n\r\n\"What is all this, James?\" he inquires of his son, who comes out to the\r\ngate to meet him.\r\n\r\n\"Frisbie's meanness!\" says the young man, almost choking. \"And the whole\r\ntown is laughing at us!\"\r\n\r\n\"Laughing at us? What have we done?\" mildly answers the parent. \"I tell\r\nyou what, James,--they sha'n't laugh at us long. We can live so as to\r\ncompel them to reverence us; and if there is any ridicule attached to\r\nthe affair, it will soon rest where it belongs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Such a sty stuck right down under our noses!\" muttered the mortified\r\nJames.\r\n\r\n\"We will make of it an ornament,\" retorts the Judge, with mounting\r\nspirits. \"Come with me,\"--taking the youth's arm. \"My son, call no human\r\nhabitation a sty. These people are our brothers, and we will show them\r\nthe kindness of brethren.\"\r\n\r\nA servant receives the horse, and Gingerford and his son cross the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\n\"Good evening, Friend Williams! So you have concluded to come and live\r\nneighbor to us, have you?\"\r\n\r\nFriend Williams was at the end of the house, occupied in improvising a\r\ncowshed under an old apple-tree. Piggy was already tied to the trunk of\r\nthe tree, and the hens and turkeys were noisily selecting their roosts\r\nin the boughs. At sight of the Judge, whose displeasure he feared, the\r\nnegro was embarrassed, and hardly knew what to say. But the pleasant\r\ngreeting of the silver-toned voice reassured him, and he stopped his\r\nwork to frame his candid, respectful answer.\r\n\r\n\"It was Mr. Frisbie that concluded. All I had to do was to go with the\r\nhouse wherever he chose to move it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, he might have done much worse by you. You have a nice landlord, a\r\nnice landlord, Mr. Williams. Mr. Frisbie is a very fine man.\"\r\n\r\nIt was Gingerford's practice to speak well of everybody with whom he had\r\nany personal relations, and especially well of his enemies; because, as\r\nhe used to say to his son, evil words commonly do more harm to him who\r\nutters them than to those they are designed to injure, while fair and\r\ngood words are easily spoken, and are the praise of their author, if of\r\nnobody else: for, if the subject of them is a bad man, they will not be\r\naccepted as literally true by any one that knows him, but, on the\r\ncontrary, they will be set down to the credit of your good-nature,--or\r\nwho knows but they may become coals of fire upon the head of your enemy,\r\nand convert him into a friend?\r\n\r\nJames had now an opportunity to test the truth of these observations.\r\nWas Mr. Williams convinced that Frisbie was a nice landlord and a fine\r\nman? By no means. But that Judge Gingerford was a fine man, and a\r\ncharitable, he believed more firmly than ever. Then there was Stephen\r\nstanding by,--having, no doubt, been sent by his master to observe the\r\nchagrin of the Gingerfords, and to bring back the report thereof; who,\r\nwhen he heard the Judge's words, looked surprised and abashed, and\r\npresently stole away, himself discomfited.\r\n\r\n\"I pray the Lord,\" said Mr. Williams, humbly and heartily, \"you won't\r\nconsider us troublesome neighbors.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope not,\" replied the Judge; \"and why should I? You have a good,\r\nhonest reputation, Friend Williams; and I hear that you are a peaceable\r\nand industrious family. We ought to be able to serve each other in many\r\nways. What can I do for you, to begin with? Wouldn't you like to turn\r\nyour cow and calf into my yard?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you a thousand times,--if I can, just as well as not,\" said the\r\ngrateful negro. \"We had to tear down the shed and pig-pen when we moved\r\nthe house, and I ha'n't had time to set 'em up again.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I imagine you have had enough to do, for one day. Let your children\r\ndrive the creatures through the gate yonder; my man will show them the\r\nshed. Are you a good gardener, Mr. Williams?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, I've done consid'able at that sort of work, Sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad of that. I have to hire a good deal of gardening done. I see\r\nwe are going to be very much obliged to your landlord for bringing us so\r\nnear together. And this is your father?\"\r\n\r\n\"My grandfather, Sir,\" said Mr. Williams.\r\n\r\n\"Your grandfather? I must shake hands with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sarvant, Sah,\" said the old man, cap off, bowing and smiling there in\r\nthe December twilight.\r\n\r\n\"He's deaf as can be,\" said Mr. Williams; \"you'll have to talk loud, to\r\nmake him hear. He's more 'n a hunderd year old.\"\r\n\r\n\"You astonish me!\" exclaimed the Judge. \"A very remarkable old person! I\r\nshould delight to converse with him,--to know what his thoughts are in\r\nthese new times, and what his memories are of the past, which, I\r\nsuppose, is even now more familiar to his mind than the objects of\r\nto-day. God bless you, my venerable friend!\" shaking hands a second time\r\nwith the ancient black, and speaking in a loud voice.\r\n\r\n\"Tankee, Sah,--very kind,\" smiled the flattered old man. \"Sarvant, Sah.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Tis you who are kind, to take notice of young fellows like me,\"\r\npleasantly replied the Judge.--\"Well, good evening, friends. I shall\r\nalways be glad to know if there is anything I can do for you. Ha! what\r\nis this?\"\r\n\r\nIt was the cow and calf coming back again, followed by Joe and\r\nFessenden's.\r\n\r\n\"Gorry!\" cried Joe,--\"wa'n't that man mad? Thought he'd bite th' ole\r\ncow's tail off!\"\r\n\r\n\"What man? My man?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said honest Fessenden's; \"he said he'd be damned if he'd have a\r\nnigger's critters along with his'n!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we'll afford him an early opportunity to be damned,\" observed the\r\nJudge. \"Drive them back again. I'll go with you.--By the way, Mr.\r\nWilliams,\"--Gingerford saw his man approaching, and spoke loud enough\r\nfor him to hear and understand,--\"are you accustomed to taking care of\r\nhorses? I may find it necessary to employ some one before long.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, yes, Sir; I'm tol'able handy about a stable,\" replied the negro.\r\n\r\n\"Hollo, there!\" called the man, somewhat sullenly, \"drive that cow back\r\nhere! Why didn't you tell me 't was the boss's orders?\"\r\n\r\n\"Did tell him so; and he said as how I lied,\" said Joe,--driving the\r\nanimals back again triumphantly.\r\n\r\nThe Judge departed with his son,--a thoughtful and aspiring youth, who\r\npondered deeply what he had seen and heard, as he walked by his father's\r\nside. And Mr. Williams, greatly relieved and gratified by the interview,\r\nhastened to relate to his family the good news. And the praises of\r\nGingerford were on all their tongues, and in their prayers that night he\r\nwas not forgotten.\r\n\r\nThree days after, the Judge's man was dismissed from his place, in\r\nconsequence of difficulties originating in the affair of the cow. The\r\nJudge had sought an early opportunity to converse with him on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\"A negro's cow,\" said he, \"is as good as anybody's cow; and I consider\r\nMr. Williams as good a man as you are.\"\r\n\r\nThe white coachman couldn't stand that; and the result was that the\r\nGingerfords had a black coachman in a few days. The situation was\r\noffered to Mr. Williams, and very glad he was to accept it.\r\n\r\nThus the wrath of man continued to work the welfare of these humble\r\nChristians. It is reasonable to doubt whether the Judge was at heart\r\ndelighted with his new neighbors; and jolly Mr. Frisbie enjoyed the joke\r\nsomewhat less, I suspect, than he anticipated. One party enjoyed it,\r\nnevertheless. It was a serious and solid satisfaction to the Williams\r\nfamily. No member of which, with the exception, perhaps, of Joe,\r\nexhibited greater pleasure at the change in their situation than the\r\nold patriarch. It rejuvenated him. His hearing was almost restored. \"One\r\nmove more,\" he said, \"and I shall be young and spry agin as the day I\r\ngot my freedom,\"--that day, so many, many years ago, which he so well\r\nremembered! Well, the \"one move more\" was near; and the morning of a new\r\nfreedom, the morning of a more perfect youth and gladness, was not\r\ndistant.\r\n\r\nIt was the old man's delight to go out and sit in the sun before the\r\ndoor, in the clear December weather, and pull off his cap to the Judge\r\nas he passed. To get a bow, and perhaps a kind word, from the\r\nillustrious Gingerford, was glory enough for one day, and the old man\r\ninvariably hurried into the house to tell of it.\r\n\r\nBut one morning a singular thing occurred. To all appearances--to the\r\neyes of all except one--he remained sitting out there in the sun after\r\nthe Judge had gone. But Fessenden's, looking up suddenly, and staring at\r\nvacancy, cried,--\r\n\r\n\"Hollo!\"\r\n\r\n\"What, child?\" asked Mrs. Williams.\r\n\r\n\"The old man!\" said Fessenden's. \"Comin' into the door! Don't ye see\r\nhim?\"\r\n\r\nNobody saw him but the lad; and of course all were astonished by his\r\nearnest announcement of the apparition. The old grandmother hastened to\r\nlook out. There sat her father still, on the bench by the apple-tree,\r\nleaning against the trunk. But the sight did not satisfy her. She ran\r\nout to him. The smile of salutation was still on his lips, which seemed\r\njust saying, \"Sarvant, Sah,\" to the Judge. But those lips would never\r\nmove again. They were the lips of death.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter, Williams?\" asked the Judge, on his return home that\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\n\"My gran'ther is dead, Sir; and I don't know where to bury him.\" This\r\nwas the negro's quiet and serious answer.\r\n\r\n\"Dead?\" ejaculates the Judge. \"Why, I saw him only this morning, and had\r\na smile from him!\"\r\n\r\n\"That was his last smile, Sir. You can see it on his face yet. He went\r\nto heaven with that smile, we trust.\"\r\n\r\nTo heaven? a negro in heaven? If that is so, some of us, I suppose, will\r\nno longer wish to go there. Or do you imagine that you will have need of\r\nservants in paradise, and that that is what Christian niggers are for?\r\nOr do you believe that in the celestial congregations there will also be\r\na place set aside for the colored brethren,--a glorified niggers' pew?\r\nYou scowl; you don't like a joke upon so serious a subject? Hypocrite!\r\ndo you see nothing but a joke here?\r\n\r\nThe Judge leaves everything and goes home with his coachman. Sure\r\nenough! there is the same smile he saw in the morning, frozen on the\r\nface of the corpse.\r\n\r\n\"Gently and late death came to him!\" says Gingerford. \"Would we could\r\nall die as happy! There is no occasion to mourn, my good woman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bless the Lord, I don't mourn!\" replied the old negress. \"But I'm so\r\nbrimful of thanks, I must cry for 't! He died a blessed ole Christian;\r\nan' he's gone straight to glory, if there's anything in the promises. He\r\nis free now, if he never was afore;--for, though they pretend there\r\na'n't no slaves in this 'ere State, an' the law freed us years ago,\r\nseems to me there a'n't no r'al liberty for us, 'cept this!\" She pointed\r\nat the corpse, then threw up her eyes and hands with an expression of\r\ndevout and joyful gratitude. \"He's gone where there a'n't no predijice\r\nagin color, bless the Lord! He's gone where all them that's been washed\r\nwith the blood of Christ is all of one color in His sight!\" Then turning\r\nto the Judge,--\"And you'll git your reward, Sir, be sure o' that!\"\r\n\r\n\"My reward?\" And Gingerford, touched with genuine emotion, shook his\r\nhead, sadly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Sir, your reward,\" repeated the old woman, tenderly arranging the\r\nsheet over the still breast, and still, folded hands of the corpse.\r\n\"For makin' his last days happy,--for makin' his last minutes happy, I\r\nmay say. That 'ere smile was for you, Sir. You was kinder to him 'n\r\nfolks in gin'ral. He wa'n't used to 't. An' he felt it. An' he's gone to\r\nglory with the news on 't. An' it'll be sot down to your credit there,\r\nin the Big Book.\"\r\n\r\nWhere was the Judge's eloquence? He could not find words to frame a\r\nfitting reply to this ignorant black woman, whose emotion was so much\r\ndeeper than any fine phrases of his could reach, and whose simple faith\r\nand gratitude overwhelmed him with the sudden conviction that he had\r\nnever yet said anything to the purpose, in all his rhetorical defences\r\nof the down-trodden race. From that conviction came humility. Out of\r\nhumility rose inspiration. Two days later his eloquence found tongue;\r\nand this was the occasion of it:--\r\n\r\nThe body of the old negro was to be buried. That he should be simply put\r\ninto the ground, and nothing said, any more than as if he were a brute\r\nbeast, did not seem befitting the obsequies of so old a man and so\r\nfaithful a Christian. The family had natural feelings on that subject.\r\nThey wanted to have a funeral sermon.\r\n\r\nNow it so happened that there was to be another funeral in the village\r\nabout that time. The old minister, had he been living, might have\r\nmanaged to attend both. But the young minister couldn't think of such a\r\nthing. The loveliest flower of maidenhood in his parish had been cut\r\ndown. One of the first families had been bereaved. Day and night he must\r\nponder and scribble to prepare a suitable discourse. And then, having\r\nexhausted spiritual grace in bedecking the tomb of the lovely, should\r\nhe,--good gracious! _could_ he descend from those heights of beauty and\r\npurity to the grave of a superannuated negro? Could divine oratory so\r\ndescend?\r\n\r\n    \"On that fair mountain leave to feed,\r\n    And batten on this _moor_\"?\r\n\r\nOught the cup of consolation, which he extended to his best, his\r\nworthiest friends and parishioners, to be passed in the same hour to\r\nthick African lips?\r\n\r\nWhich questions were, of course, decided in the negative. There was\r\nanother minister in the village, but he was sick. What should be done?\r\nTo go wandering about the world in search of somebody to preach the\r\nfuneral sermon seemed a hard case,--as Mr. Williams remarked to the\r\nJudge.\r\n\r\n\"Tell you what, Williams,\" said the Judge,--\"don't give yourself any\r\nmore trouble on that account. I'm not a minister, nor half good enough\r\nfor one,\"--he could afford to speak disparagingly of himself, the\r\nbeautiful, gracious gentleman!--\"but if you can't do any better, I'll be\r\npresent and say a few words at the funeral.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you a thousand times!\" said the grateful negro. \"Couldn't be\r\nnothin' better 'n that! We never expected no such honor; an' if my ole\r\ngran'ther could have knowed you would speak to his funeral, he'd have\r\nbeen proud, Sir!\"\r\n\r\n\"He was a simple-minded old soul!\" replied the Judge, pleasantly. \"And\r\nyou're another, Williams! However, I am glad you are satisfied. So this\r\ndifficulty is settled, too.\" For already one very serious difficulty had\r\nbeen arranged through this man's kindness.\r\n\r\nDid I neglect to mention it,--how, when the old negro died, his family\r\nhad no place to bury him? The rest of his race, dying before him, had\r\nbeen gathered to the mother's bosom in distant places: long lines of\r\ndusky ancestors in Africa; a few descendants in America,--here and there\r\na grave among New-England hills. Only one, a child of Mr. Williams's,\r\nhad died in Timberville, and been placed in the old burying-ground over\r\nyonder. But that was now closed against interments. And as for\r\npurchasing a lot in the new cemetery,--how could poor Mr. Williams ever\r\nhope to raise money to pay for it?\r\n\r\n\"Williams,\" said the Judge, \"I own several lots there, and if you'll be\r\na good boy, I'll make you a present of one.\"\r\n\r\nAh, Gingerford! Gingerford! was it pure benevolence that prompted the\r\ngift? Was the smile with which you afterwards related the circumstance\r\nto dear Mrs. Gingerford a smile of sincere satisfaction at having done a\r\ngood action and witnessed the surprise and gratitude of your black\r\ncoachman? Tell us, was it altogether an accident, with no tincture\r\nwhatever of pleasant malice in it, that the lot you selected, out of\r\nseveral, to be the burial-place of negroes, lay side by side with the\r\nproud family-vault of your neighbor Frisbie?\r\n\r\nThe Judge was one of those cool heads, who, when they have received an\r\ninjury, do not go raving of it up and down, but put it quietly aside,\r\nand keep their temper, and rest content to wait patiently, perhaps\r\nyears, perhaps a lifetime, for the opportunity of a sudden and pat\r\nrevenge. Indeed, I suppose he would have been well satisfied to answer\r\nFrisbie's spite with the nobler revenge of magnanimity and smiling\r\nforbearance, had not the said opportunity presented itself. It was a\r\ntemptation not to be resisted. And he, the most philanthropical of men,\r\nproved himself capable of being also the most cruel.\r\n\r\nThere, in the choicest quarter of the cemetery, shone the white\r\nancestral monuments of the Frisbies. Death, the leveller, had not,\r\nsomehow, levelled them,--proud and pretentious even in their tombs. You\r\nfelt, as you read the sculptured record of their names and virtues, that\r\neven their ashes were better than the ashes of common mortals. They\r\nrendered sacred not only the still inclosure where they lay, but all\r\nthat beautiful sunny bank; so that nobody else had presumed to be buried\r\nnear them, but a space of many square rods on either side was left still\r\nunappropriated,--until now, when, lo! here comes a black funeral, and\r\nthe corpse of one who had been a slave in his day, to profane the soil!\r\n\r\nNor is this all, alas! There comes not one funeral procession only. The\r\nfirst has scarcely entered the cemetery, when a second arrives. Side by\r\nside the dead of this day are to be laid: our old friend the negro, and\r\nthe lovely young lady we have mentioned,--even the fairest of Mr.\r\nFrisbie's own children.\r\n\r\nFor it is she. The sweetest of the faces Fessenden's saw that stormy\r\nnight at the window, and yearned to be within the bright room where the\r\nfire, was,--that dear warm face is cold in yonder coffin which the\r\nafflicted family are attending to the tomb.\r\n\r\nAnd Frisbie, as we have somewhere said, loved his children. And in the\r\nanguish of his bereavement he had not heeded the singular and somewhat\r\nhumiliating fact that his daughter had issued from the portal of Time in\r\ncompany with one of his most despised tenants,--that, in the same hour,\r\nalmost at the same moment, Death had summoned them, leading them\r\ntogether, as it were, one with his right hand, and one with his left,\r\nthe way of all the world. So that here was a surprise for the proud and\r\ngrief-smitten parent.\r\n\r\n\"What is all that, Stephen?\" he demands, with sudden consternation.\r\n\r\n\"It seems to be another funeral, Sir. They're buryin' somebody next lot\r\nto yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who, who, Stephen?\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I ruther guess it's the old nigger, Sir,\" says Stephen.\r\n\r\nThe mighty man is shaken. Wrath and sorrow and insulted affection\r\nconvulse him for a moment. His face grows purple, then pale, and he\r\nstruggles with his neckcloth, which is choking him. He sees the tall\r\nform of Gingerford at the grave, and knows what it is to wish to murder\r\na man. Were those two Christian neighbors quite alone, in this solitude\r\nof the dead, I fear one of them would soon be a fit subject for a\r\ncoroner's inquest and an epitaph. O pride and hatred! with what madness\r\ncan you inspire a mortal man! O Fessenden's! bless thy stars that thou\r\nart not the only fool alive this day, nor the greatest!\r\n\r\nFessenden's walked alone to the funeral, talking by himself, and now\r\nand then laughing. Gentleman Bill thought his conduct indecorous, and\r\nreproved him for it.\r\n\r\n\"Gracious!\" said the lad, \"don't you see who I'm talkin' with?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Sir,--I can't say I see anybody, Sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"No?\" exclaimed the astonished youth. \"Why, it's the old man, goin' to\r\nhis own funeral!\"\r\n\r\nThis, you may say, was foolishness; but, oh, it was innocent and\r\nbeautiful foolishness, compared with that of Frisbie and his\r\nsympathizers, when they discovered the negro burial, and felt that their\r\nmourning was too respectable to be the near companion of the mourning of\r\nthose poor blacks, and that their beautiful dead was too precious to be\r\nlaid in the earth beside their dead.\r\n\r\nWhat could be done? Indignation and sorrow availed nothing. The tomb of\r\nthe lovely was prepared, and it only remained to pity the affront to her\r\nashes, as she was committed to the chill depths amid silence and choking\r\ntears. It is done; and the burial of the old negro is deferentially\r\ndelayed until the more aristocratic rites are ended.\r\n\r\nGingerford set the example of standing with his hat off in the yellow\r\nsunshine and wintry air, with his noble head bowed low, while the last\r\nprayer was said at the maiden's sepulture. Then he lifted up his face,\r\nradiant; and the flashing and rainbow-spanned torrent of his eloquence\r\nbroke forth. He had reserved his forces for this hour. He had not the\r\nWilliams family and their friends alone for an audience, but many who\r\nhad come to attend the young lady's funeral remained to hear the Judge.\r\nIt was worth their while. Finely as he had discoursed at the hut of the\r\nnegroes, before the corpse was brought out, that was scarcely the time,\r\nthat was certainly not the place, for a crowning effort of his genius.\r\nBut here, his larger audience, the open air, the blue heavens, the\r\ngraves around, the burial of the young girl side by side with the old\r\nslave, all contributed to inspire him. Human brotherhood, universal\r\nlove, the stern democracy of death, immortality,--these were his theme.\r\nLife, incrusted with conventionalities; Death, that strips them all\r\naway. This is the portal (pointing to the grave) at which the soul drops\r\nall its false incumbrances,--rank, riches, sorrow, shame. It enters\r\nnaked into eternity. There worldly pride and arrogance have no place.\r\nThere false judgment goes out like a sick man's night-lamp, in the\r\nmorning light of truth. In the courts of God only spiritual distinctions\r\nprevail. That you were a lord in this life will be of no account there,\r\nwhere the humblest Christian love is preferred before the most brilliant\r\nselfishness,--where the master is degraded, and the servant is exalted.\r\nAnd so forth, and so forth; a brief, but eloquent address, of which it\r\nis to be regretted that no report exists.\r\n\r\nThen came the prayer,--for the Judge had a gift that way too; and the\r\ntenderness and true feeling with which he spoke of the old negro and the\r\nwrongs of his race drew tears from many eyes. Then a hymn was\r\nsung,--those who had stayed to sneer joining their voices seriously with\r\nthose of the lowly mourners.\r\n\r\nA few days later, Mr. Williams had the remains of his child taken from\r\nthe old burying-ground, and brought here, and laid beside the patriarch.\r\nAnd before spring, simple tombstones of white marble (at Gingerford's\r\nexpense) marked the spot, and commemorated the circumstances of the old\r\nman's extreme age and early bondage.\r\n\r\nAnd before spring, alas! three other graves were added to that sunny\r\nbank! One by one, all those fair children whom Fessenden's had seen in\r\nthe warm room where the fire was had followed their sister to the tomb.\r\nSo fast they followed that Mr. Frisbie had no time to move his\r\nfamily-vault from the degrading proximity of the negro graves. And\r\nFessenden's still lived, an orphan, yet happy, in the family of blacks\r\nwhich had adopted him; while the parents of those children, who had\r\nloved them, were left alone in the costly house, desolate. Was it, as\r\nsome supposed, a judgment upon Frisbie for his pride? I cannot tell. I\r\nonly know, that, in the end, that pride was utterly broken,--and that,\r\nwhen the fine words of the young minister failed to console him, when\r\nsympathizing friends surrounded him, and Gingerford came to visit him,\r\nand they were reconciled, he turned from them all, and gratefully\r\nreceived hope and comfort from the lips of a humble old Christian who\r\nhad nursed the last of his children in her days and nights of suffering,\r\nalmost against his will.\r\n\r\nThat Christian? It was the old negro woman.\r\n\r\nEarly in the spring, Mr. Williams----But no more! Haven't we already\r\nprolonged our sketch to an intolerable length, considering the subject\r\nof it? Not a lover in it! and, of course, it is preposterous to think of\r\nmaking a readable story without one. Why didn't we make young Gingerford\r\nin love with--let's see--Miss Frisbie? and Miss Frisbie's brother (it\r\nwould have required but a stroke of the pen to give her one) in love\r\nwith--Creshy Williams? What melodramatic difficulties might have been\r\nbuilt upon this foundation! And as for Fessenden's being a fool and a\r\npauper, he should turn out to be the son of some proud man, either\r\nGingerford or Frisbie. But it is too late now. We acknowledge our fatal\r\nmistake. Who cares for the fortunes of a miserable negro family? Who\r\ncares to know the future of Mr. Williams, or of any of his race?\r\n\r\nSuffice it, then, to say, that, as for the Williamses, God has taken\r\ncare of them in every trial,--turning even the wrath of enemies to their\r\nadvantage, as we have seen; just as He will, no doubt, in His fatherly\r\nkindness, provide for that unhappy race which is now in the perilous\r\ncrisis of its destiny, and concerning which so many, both its friends\r\nand enemies, are anxiously asking, \"What will become of them?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORGOTTEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n      In this dim shadow, where\r\n    She found the quiet which all tired hearts crave,\r\n      Now, without grief or care,\r\n    The wild bees murmur, and the blossoms wave,\r\n      And the forgetful air\r\n    Blows heedlessly across her grassy grave.\r\n\r\n      Yet, when she lived on earth,\r\n    She loved this leafy dell, and knew by name\r\n      All things of sylvan birth;\r\n    Squirrel and bird chirped welcome, when she came:\r\n      Yet now, in careless mirth,\r\n    They frisk, and build, and warble all the same.\r\n\r\n      From the great city near,\r\n    Wherein she toiled through life's incessant quest,\r\n      For weary year on year,\r\n    Come the far voices of its deep unrest,\r\n      To touch her dead, deaf ear,\r\n    And surge unechoed o'er her pulseless breast.\r\n\r\n      The hearts which clung to her\r\n    Have sought out other shrines, as all hearts must,\r\n      When Time, the comforter,\r\n    Has worn their grief out, and replaced their trust:\r\n      Not even neglect can stir\r\n    This little handful of forgotten dust.\r\n\r\n      Grass waves, and insects hum,\r\n    And then the snow blows bitterly across;\r\n      Strange footsteps go and come,\r\n    Breaking the dew-drops on the starry moss:\r\n      She lieth still and dumb,\r\n    And counts no longer any gain or loss.\r\n\r\n      Ah, well,--'t is better so;\r\n    Let the dust deepen as the years increase;\r\n      Of her who sleeps below\r\n    Let the name perish and the memory cease,\r\n      Since she has come to know\r\n    That which through life she vainly prayed for,--Peace!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWET-WEATHER WORK.\r\n\r\nBY A FARMER.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.--CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nAs I sit in my library-chair listening to the welcome drip from the\r\neaves, I bethink me of the great host of English farm-teachers who in\r\nthe last century wrote and wrought so well, and wonder why their\r\nprecepts and their example should not have made a garden of that little\r\nBritish island. To say nothing of the inherited knowledge of such men as\r\nSir Anthony Fitz-Herbert, Hugh Platt, Markham, Lord Bacon, Hartlib, and\r\nthe rest, there was Tull, who had blazed a new path between the turnip\r\nand the wheat-drills--to fortune; there was Lord Kames, who illustrated\r\nwith rare good sense, and the daintiness of a man of letters, all the\r\neconomies of a thrifty husbandry; Sir John Sinclair proved the\r\nwisdom of thorough culture upon tracts that almost covered counties;\r\nBakewell (of Dishley)--that fine old farmer in breeches and top-boots,\r\nwho received Russian princes and French marquises at his\r\nkitchen-fireside--demonstrated how fat might be laid on sheep or cattle\r\nfor the handling of a butcher; in fact, he succeeded so far, that Dr.\r\nParkinson once told Paley that the great breeder had \"the power of\r\nfattening his sheep in whatever part of the body he chose, directing it\r\nto shoulder, leg, or neck, as he thought proper,--and this,\" continued\r\nParkinson, \"is the great _problem_ of his art.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a lie, Sir,\" said Paley,--\"and that's the _solution_ of it.\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet Dr. Parkinson was very near the truth.\r\n\r\nBesides Bakewell, there was Arthur Young, as we have seen, giving all\r\nEngland the benefit of agricultural comparisons by his admirable\r\n\"Tours\"; Lord Dundonald had brought his chemical knowledge to the aid\r\nof good husbandry; Abercrombie and Speechly and Marshall had written\r\ntreatises on all that regarded good gardening. The nurseries of\r\nTottenham Court Road, the parterres of Chelsea, and the stoves of the\r\nYew Gardens were luxuriant witnesses of what the enterprising gardener\r\nmight do.\r\n\r\nAgriculture, too, had a certain dignity given to it by the fact that\r\n\"Farmer George\" (the King) had written his experiences for a journal of\r\nArthur Young, the Duke of Bedford was one of the foremost advocates of\r\nimproved farming, and Lord Townshend took a pride in his _sobriquet_ of\r\n\"Turnip Townshend.\"\r\n\r\nYet, for all this, at the opening of the present century, England was by\r\nno means a garden. Over more than half the kingdom, turnips, where sown\r\nat all, were sown broadcast. In four counties out of five, a bare fallow\r\nwas deemed essential for the recuperation of cropped lands. Barley and\r\noats were more often grown than wheat. Dibbling or drilling of grain,\r\nnotwithstanding Platt and Jethro Tull, were still rare. The wet\r\nclay-lands had, for the most part, no drainage, save the open furrows\r\nwhich were as old as the teachings of Xenophon; indeed, it will hardly\r\nbe credited, when I state that it is only so late as 1843 that a certain\r\ngardener, John Reade by name, at the Derby Show of the Royal\r\nAgricultural Society, exhibited certain cylindrical pipes, which he had\r\nformed by wrapping damp clay around a smooth billet of wood, and with\r\nwhich he \"had been in the habit of draining the hot-beds of his master.\"\r\nA sagacious engineer who was present, and saw these, examined them\r\nclosely, and, calling the attention of Earl Spencer (the eminent\r\nagriculturist) to them, said, \"My Lord, with them I can drain all\r\nEngland.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not until about 1830 that the subsoil-plough of Mr. Smith of\r\nDeanston was first contrived for special work upon the lands of\r\nPerthshire. Notwithstanding all the brilliant successes of Bakewell,\r\nlong-legged, raw-boned cattle were admired by the majority of British\r\nfarmers at the opening of this century, and elephantine monsters of this\r\ndescription were dragged about England in vans for exhibition. It was\r\nonly in 1798 that the \"Smithfield Club\" was inaugurated for the show of\r\nfat cattle, by the Duke of Bedford, Lord Somerville, Arthur Young, and\r\nothers; and it was about the same period that young Jonas Webb (whose\r\nlife has latterly been illustrated by a glowing chapter from Elihu\r\nBurritt) used to ride upon the Norfolk bucks bred by his grandfather,\r\nand, with a quick sense of discomfort from their sharp backs, vowed,\r\nthat, when he \"grew a man, he'd make better saddles for them\"; and he\r\ndid, as every one knows who has ever seen a good type of the Brabaham\r\nflock.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Agricultural Society dates from 1838. In 1835 Sir Robert Peel\r\npresented a farmers' club at Tamworth with \"two iron ploughs of the best\r\nconstruction,\" and when he inquired after them and their work the\r\nfollowing year, the report was that the wooden mould-board was better:\r\n\"We tried 'em, but we be all of one mind, that the iron made the weeds\r\ngrow.\" And I can recall a bright morning in January of 1845, when I made\r\ntwo bouts around a field in the middle of the best dairy-district of\r\nDevonshire, at the stilts of a plough so cumbrous and ineffective that a\r\nthrifty New-England farmer would have discarded it at sight. Nor can I\r\nomit, in this connection, to revive, so far as I may, the image of a\r\nsmall Devon farmer, who had lived, and I dare say will die, utterly\r\nignorant of the instructions of Tull, or of the agricultural labors of\r\nArthur Young: a short, wheezy, rotund figure of a man, with ruddy\r\nface,--fastening the _h_s in his talk most blunderingly,--driving over\r\nto the market-town every fair-day, with pretty samples of wheat or\r\nbarley in his dog-cart,--believing in the royal family like a\r\ngospel,--limiting his reading to glances at the \"Times\" in the\r\ntap-room,--looking with an evil eye upon railways, (which, in that day,\r\nhad not intruded farther than Exeter into his shire,)--distrusting\r\nterribly the spread of \"eddication\": it \"doan't help the work-folk any;\r\nfor, d' ye see, they've to keep a mind on their pleughing and craps; and\r\nas for the b'ys, the big uns must mind the beasts, and the little uns's\r\ngot enough to do a-scaring the demed rooks. Gads! what hodds to them,\r\nplease your Honor, what Darby is a-dooin' up in Lunnun, or what\r\nLewis-Philup is a-dooin' with the Frenchers?\" And the ruddy\r\nfarmer-gentleman stirs his toddy afresh, lays his right leg caressingly\r\nover his left leg, admires his white-topped boots, and is the picture of\r\nBritish complacency. I hope he is living; I hope he stirs his toddy\r\nstill in the tap-room of the inn by the pretty Erme River; but I hope\r\nthat he has grown wiser as he has grown older, and that he has given\r\nover his wheezy curses at the engine as it hurtles past on the iron way\r\nto Plymouth and to Penzance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe work was not all done for the agriculture and the agriculturist of\r\nEngland in the last century; it is hardly all done yet; it is doubtful\r\nif it will be done so as to close investigation and ripen method in our\r\ntime. There was room for a corps of fresh workers at the opening of the\r\npresent century; nor was such a corps lacking.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1808, a certain John Christian Curwen, Member of\r\nParliament, and dating from Cumberland, wrote \"Hints on Agricultural\r\nSubjects,\" a big octavo volume, in which he suggests the steaming of\r\npotatoes for horses, as a substitute for hay; but it does not appear\r\nthat the suggestion was well received. To his credit, however, it may be\r\nsaid, that, in the same book, he urged the system of \"soiling\"\r\ncattle,--a system which even now needs its earnest expounders, and which\r\nwould give full warrant for their loudest exhortation.\r\n\r\nI notice, too, that, at about the same period, Dr. Beddoes, the friend\r\nand early patron of Sir Humphry Davy at the Pneumatic Institution of\r\nBristol, wrote a book with the quaint title, \"Good Advice to Husbandmen\r\nin Harvest, and for all those who labor in Hot Berths, and for others\r\nwho will take it--in Warm Weather.\" And with the recollection of Davy's\r\ndescription of the Doctor in my mind,--\"uncommonly short and\r\nfat,\"[27]--I have felt a great interest in seeing what such a man should\r\nhave to say upon harvest-heats; but his book, so far as I know, is not\r\nto be found in America.\r\n\r\nA certain John Harding, of St. James Street, London, published, in 1809,\r\na tract upon \"The Use of Sugar in Feeding Cattle,\" in which were set\r\nforth sundry experiments which went to show how bullocks had been\r\nfattened on molasses, and had been rewarded with a premium. I am\r\nindebted for all knowledge of this anomalous tractate to the\r\n\"Agricultural Biography\" of Mr. Donaldson, who seems disposed to give a\r\nsheltering wing to the curious theory broached, and discourses upon it\r\nwith a lucidity and coherence worthy of a state-paper. I must be\r\npermitted to quote Mr. Donaldson's language:--\"The author's ideas are no\r\nromance or chimera, but a very feasible entertainment of the\r\nundertaking, when a social revolution permits the fruits of all climes\r\nto be used in freedom of the burden of value that is imposed by\r\nmonopoly, and restricts the legitimate appropriation.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge Adams, in 1810, proposed \"A New System of Agriculture and Feeding\r\nStock,\" of which the novelty lay in movable sheds, (upon iron\r\ntram-ways,) for the purpose of soiling cattle. The method was certainly\r\noriginal; nor can it be regarded as wholly visionary in our time, when\r\nthe iron conduits of Mr. Mechi, under the steam-thrust of the Tip-Tree\r\nengines, are showing a percentage of profit.\r\n\r\nCharles Drury, in the same year, recommended, in an elaborate treatise,\r\nthe steaming of straw, roots, and hay, for cattle-food,--a\r\nrecommendation which, in our time, has been put into most successful\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nMowbray, who was for a long time the great authority upon Domestic Fowls\r\nand their Treatment, published his book in 1803, which he represents as\r\nhaving been compiled from the memoranda of forty years' experience.\r\n\r\nAnd next, as illustrative of the rural literature of the early part of\r\nthis century, I must introduce the august name of Sir Humphry Davy. This\r\nI am warranted in doing on two several counts: first, because he was an\r\naccomplished fisherman and the author of \"Salmonia,\" and next, because\r\nhe was the first scientific man of any repute who was formally invited\r\nby a Board of Agriculture to discuss the relations of Chemistry to the\r\npractice of farming.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, he was himself ignorant of practical agriculture,[28]\r\nwhen called upon to illustrate its relations to chemistry; but, like an\r\nearnest man, he set about informing himself by communication with the\r\nbest farmers of the kingdom. He delivered a very admirable series of\r\nlectures, and it was without doubt most agreeable to the\r\ncountry-gentlemen to find the great waste from their fermenting manures\r\nmade clear by Sir Humphry's retorts; but Davy was too profound and too\r\nhonest a man to lay down for farmers any chemical high-road to success.\r\nHe directed and stimulated inquiry; he developed many of the principles\r\nwhich underlay their best practice; but he offered them no safety-lamp.\r\nI think he brought more zeal to his investigations in the domain of pure\r\nscience; he loved well-defined and brilliant results; and I do not think\r\nthat he pushed his inquiries in regard to the way in which the\r\nforage-plants availed themselves of sulphate of lime with one-half the\r\nearnestness or delight with which he conducted his discovery of the\r\nintegral character of chlorine, or with which he saw for the first time\r\nthe metallic globules bubbling out from the electrified crust of potash.\r\n\r\nYet he loved the country with a rare and thorough love, as his\r\ndescriptions throughout his letters prove; and he delighted in straying\r\naway, in the leafy month of June, to the charming place of his friend\r\nKnight, upon the Teme in Herefordshire. His \"Salmonia\" is, in its way, a\r\npastoral; not, certainly, to be compared with the original of Walton,\r\nlacking its simple homeliness, for which its superior scientific\r\naccuracy can make but poor amends. I cannot altogether forget, in\r\nreading it, that its author is a fine gentleman from London. Neither\r\nfish, nor alders, nor eddies, nor purling shallows, can drive out of\r\nmemory the fact that Sir Humphry must be back at \"The Hall\" by half-past\r\nsix, in season to dress for dinner. Walton, in slouch-hat, bound about\r\nwith \"leaders,\" sat upon the green turf to listen to a milkmaid's song.\r\nSir Humphry (I think he must have carried a camp-stool) recited some\r\nverses written by \"a noble lady long distinguished at court.\"[29]\r\n\r\nIn fact, there was always a great deal of the fine gentleman about the\r\ngreat chemist,--almost too fine for the quiet tenor of a working-life.\r\nThose first brilliant successes of his professional career at the Royal\r\nInstitution of London, before he was turned of thirty, and in which his\r\nyouth, his splendid elocution, his happy discoveries, his attractive\r\nmanner, all made him the mark for distinguished attentions, went very\r\nfar, I fancy, to carry him to that stage of social intoxication under\r\nwhich he was deluded into marrying a wealthy lady of fashion, and a\r\nconfirmed blue-stocking,--the brilliant Mrs. Apreece.\r\n\r\nLittle domestic comfort ever came of the marriage. Yet he was a\r\nchivalrous man, and took the issue calmly. It is always in his\r\nletters,--\"My dear Jane,\" and \"God bless you! Yours affectionately.\" But\r\nthese expressions bound the tender passages. It was altogether a\r\ngentlemanly and a lady-like affair. Only once, as I can find, he forgets\r\nhimself in an honest repining; it is in a letter to his brother, under\r\ndate of October 30, 1823:[30]--\"To add to my annoyances, I find my\r\nhouse, as usual, after the arrangements made by the mistress of it,\r\nwithout female servants; but in this world we have to suffer and bear,\r\nand from Socrates down to humble mortals, domestic discomfort seems a\r\nsort of philosophical fate.\"\r\n\r\nIf only Lady Davy could have seen this Xantippe touch, I think Sir\r\nHumphry would have taken to angling in some quiet country-place for a\r\nmonth thereafter!\r\n\r\nAnd even when affairs grow serious with the Baronet, and when, stricken\r\nby the palsy, he is loitering among the mountains of Styria, he\r\nwrites,--\"I am glad to hear of your perfect restoration, and with health\r\nand the society of London, _which you are so fitted to ornament and\r\nenjoy_, your '_viva la felicità_' is much more secure than any hope\r\nbelonging to me.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again, \"You once _talked_ of passing _this_ winter in Italy; but I\r\nhope your plans will be entirely guided by the state of your health and\r\nfeelings. Your society would undoubtedly be a very great resource to me,\r\nbut I am so well aware of my own present unfitness for society that I\r\nwould not have you risk the chance of an uncomfortable moment on my\r\naccount.\"\r\n\r\nThe dear Lady Jane must have had a _penchant_ for society to leave the\r\npoor palsied man to tumble into his tomb alone!\r\n\r\nYet once again, in the last letter he ever writes, dated Rome, March,\r\n1829, he gallantly asks her to join him; it begins,--\"I am still alive,\r\nthough expecting every hour to be released.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the Lady Jane, who is washing off her fashionable humors in the\r\nfashionable waters of Bath, writes,--\"I have received, my beloved Sir\r\nHumphry, the letter signed by your hand, with its precious wish of\r\ntenderness. I start to-morrow, _having been detained here_ by Doctors\r\nBabington and Clarke till to-day.... I cannot add more\" (it is a letter\r\nof half a page) \"than that your fame is a deposit, and your memory a\r\nglory, your life still a hope.\"\r\n\r\nSweet Lady Jane! Yet they say she mourned him duly, and set a proper\r\nheadstone at his grave. But, for my own part, I have no faith in that\r\naffection which will splinter a loving heart every day of its life, and\r\nyet, when it has ceased to beat, will make atonement with an idle swash\r\nof tears.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was a British farmer by the name of Morris Birkbeck, who about the\r\nyear 1814 wrote an account of an agricultural tour in France; and who\r\nsubsequently established himself somewhere upon our Western prairies, of\r\nwhich he gave account in \"Letters from Illinois,\" and in \"Notes on a\r\nJourney in America, from the Coast of Virginia to the Territory of\r\nIllinois,\" with maps, etc. Cobbett once or twice names him as \"poor\r\nBirkbeck,\"--but whether in allusion to his having been drowned in one of\r\nour Western rivers, or to the poverty of his agricultural successes, it\r\nis hard to determine.\r\n\r\nIn 1820 Major-General Beatson, who had been Aid to the Marquis of\r\nWellesley in India, published an account of a new system of farming,\r\nwhich he claimed to have in successful operation at his place in the\r\nCounty of Sussex. The novelty of the system lay in the fact that he\r\nabandoned both manures and the plough, and scarified the surface to the\r\ndepth of two or three inches, after which he burned it over. The\r\nMajor-General was called to the governorship of St. Helena before his\r\nsystem had made much progress. I am led to allude to the plan as one of\r\nthe premonitory hints of that rotary method which is just now enlisting\r\na large degree of attention in the agricultural world, and which\r\npromises to supplant the plough on all wide stretches of land, within\r\nthe present century.\r\n\r\nFinlayson, a brawny Scot, born in the parish of Mauchline, who was known\r\nfrom \"Glentuck to the Rutton-Ley\" as the best man for \"putting the\r\nstone,\" or for a \"hop, step, and leap,\" contrived the self-cleaning\r\nploughs (with circular beam) and harrows which bore his name. He was\r\nalso--besides being the athlete of Ayrshire--the author of sundry\r\ncreditable and practical works on agriculture.\r\n\r\nBut the most notable man in connection with rural literature, of this\r\nday, was, by all odds, William Cobbett. His early history has so large a\r\nflavor of romance in it that I am sure my readers will excuse me for\r\ndetailing it.\r\n\r\nHis grandfather was a day-laborer; he died before Cobbett was born; but\r\nthe author says that he used to visit the grandmother at Christmas and\r\nWhitsuntide. Her home was \"a little thatched cottage, with a garden\r\nbefore the door. She used to give us milk and bread for breakfast, an\r\napple-pudding for dinner, and a piece of bread and cheese for our\r\nsupper. Her fire was made of turf cut from the neighboring heath; and\r\nher evening light was a rush dipped in grease.\"[31] His father was a\r\nsmall farmer, and one who did not allow his boys to grow up in idleness.\r\n\"My first occupation,\" he tells us, \"was driving the small birds from\r\nthe turnip-seed, and the rook from the pease; when I first trudged\r\na-field, with my wooden bottle and my satchel swung over my shoulders, I\r\nwas hardly able to climb the gates and stiles; and at the close of the\r\nday, to reach home was a task of infinite difficulty.\"\r\n\r\nAt the age of eleven he speaks of himself as occupied in clipping\r\nbox-edgings and weeding flower-beds in the garden of the Bishop of\r\nWinchester; and while here he encounters, one day, a workman who has\r\njust come from the famous Kew Gardens of the King. Young Cobbett is\r\nfired by the glowing description, and resolves that he must see them,\r\nand work upon them too. So he sets off, one summer's morning, with only\r\nthe clothes he has upon his back, and with thirteen halfpence in his\r\npocket, for Richmond. And as he trudges through the streets of the town,\r\nafter a hard day's walk, in his blue smock-frock, and with his red\r\ngarters tied under his knees, staring about him, he sees in the window\r\nof a bookseller's shop the \"Tale of a Tub,\" price threepence; it piques\r\nhis curiosity, and, though his money is nearly all spent, he closes a\r\nbargain for the book, and, throwing himself down upon the shady side of\r\na hay-rick, makes his first acquaintance with Dean Swift. He read till\r\nit was dark, without thought of supper or of bed,--then tumbled down\r\nupon the grass under the shadow of the stack, and slept till the birds\r\nof the Kew Gardens waked him.\r\n\r\nHe finds work, as he had determined to do; but it was not fated that he\r\nshould pass his life amid the pleasant parterres of Kew. At sixteen, or\r\nthereabout, on a visit to a relative, he catches his first sight of the\r\nChannel waters, and of the royal fleet riding at anchor at Spithead. And\r\nat that sight, the \"old Armada,\" and the \"brave Rodney,\" and the \"wooden\r\nwalls,\" of which he had read, come drifting like a poem into his\r\nthought, and he vows that he will become a sailor,--maybe, in time, the\r\nAdmiral Cobbett. But here, too, the fates are against him: a kind\r\ncaptain to whom he makes application suspects him for a runaway, and\r\nadvises him to find his way home.\r\n\r\nHe returns once more to the plough; \"but,\" he says, \"I was now spoiled\r\nfor a farmer.\" He sighs for the world; the little horizon of Farnham\r\n(his native town) is too narrow for him; and the very next year he makes\r\nhis final escapade.\r\n\r\n\"It was on the 6th of May, 1783, that I, like Don Quixote, sallied forth\r\nto seek adventures. I was dressed in my holiday clothes, in order to\r\naccompany two or three lasses to Guildford fair. They were to assemble\r\nat a house about three miles from my home, where I was to attend them;\r\nbut, unfortunately for me, I had to cross the London turnpike-road. The\r\nstage-coach had just turned the summit of a hill, and was rattling down\r\ntowards me at a merry rate. The notion of going to London never entered\r\nmy mind till this very moment; yet the step was completely determined on\r\nbefore the coach came to the spot where I stood. Up I got, and was in\r\nLondon about nine o'clock in the evening.\"\r\n\r\nHis immediate adventure in the metropolis proves to be his instalment as\r\nscrivener in an attorney's office. No wonder he chafes at this; no\r\nwonder, that, in his wanderings about town, he is charmed by an\r\nadvertisement which invited all loyal and public-spirited young men to\r\nrepair to a certain \"rendezvous\"; he goes to the rendezvous, and\r\npresently finds himself a recruit in one of His Majesty's regiments\r\nwhich is filling up for service in British America.\r\n\r\nHe must have been an apt soldier, so far as drill went; for I find that\r\nhe rose rapidly to the grade of corporal, and thence to the position of\r\nsergeant-major. He tells us that his early habits, his strict attention\r\nto duty, and his native talent were the occasion of his swift promotion.\r\nIn New Brunswick, upon a certain winter's morning, he falls in with the\r\nrosy-faced daughter of a sergeant of artillery, who was scrubbing her\r\npans at sunrise, upon the snow. \"I made up my mind,\" he says, \"that she\r\nwas the very girl for me.... This matter was at once settled as firmly\r\nas if written in the book of fate.\"\r\n\r\nTo this end he determines to leave the army as soon as possible. But\r\nbefore he can effect this, the artillery-man is ordered back to England,\r\nand his pretty daughter goes with him. But Cobbett has closed the\r\ncompact with her, and placed in her hands a hundred and fifty pounds of\r\nhis earnings,--a free gift, and an earnest of his troth.\r\n\r\nThe very next season, however, he meets, in a sweet rural solitude of\r\nthe Province, another charmer, with whom he dallies in a lovelorn way\r\nfor two years or more. He cannot quite forget the old; he cannot cease\r\nbefondling the new. If only the \"remotest rumor had come,\" says he, \"of\r\nthe faithlessness of the brunette in England, I should have been\r\nfastened for life in the New-Brunswick valley.\" But no such rumor comes,\r\nand in due time he bids a heart-rending adieu, and recrosses the ocean\r\nto find his first love maid-of-all-work in a gentleman's family at five\r\npounds a year; and she puts in his hand, upon their first interview, the\r\nwhole of the hundred and fifty pounds, untouched. This rekindles his\r\nadmiration and respect for her judgment, and she becomes his wife,--a\r\nwife he never ceases thereafter to love and honor.\r\n\r\nHe goes to France, and thence to America. Establishing himself in\r\nPhiladelphia, he enters upon the career of authorship, with a zeal for\r\nthe King, and a hatred of Dr. Franklin and all Democrats, which give him\r\na world of trouble. His foul bitterness of speech finds its climax at\r\nlength in a brutal onslaught upon Dr. Rush, for which he is prosecuted,\r\nconvicted, and mulcted in a sum that breaks down his bookselling and\r\ninterrupts the profits of his authorship.\r\n\r\nHe retires to England, opens shop in Pall-Mall, and edits the\r\n\"Porcupine,\" which bristles with envenomed arrows discharged against all\r\nLiberals and Democrats. Again he is prosecuted, convicted, imprisoned.\r\nHis boys, well taught in all manner of farm-work, send him, from his\r\nhome in the country, hampers of fresh fruits, to relieve the tedium of\r\nNewgate. Discharged at length, and continuing his ribaldry in the\r\ncolumns of the \"Register,\" he flies before an Act of Parliament, and\r\ntakes new refuge in America. He is now upon Long Island, earnest as in\r\nhis youth in agricultural pursuits. The late Dr. Francis of New York\r\nused to speak of his visits to him, and of the fine vegetables he\r\nraised. His political opinions had undergone modification; there was not\r\nso much declamation against democracy,--not so much angry zeal for\r\nroyalty and the state-church. Nay, he committed the stupendous absurdity\r\nof carrying back with him to England the bones of Tom Paine, as the\r\ngrandest gift he could bestow upon his mother-land. No great ovations\r\ngreeted this strange luggage of his; I think he was ashamed of it\r\nafterwards,--if Cobbett was ever ashamed of anything. He became\r\ncandidate for Parliament in the Liberal interest; he undertook those\r\nfamous \"Rural Rides\" which are a rare jumble of sweet rural scenes and\r\ncrazy political objurgation. Now he hammers the \"parsons,\"--now he tears\r\nthe paper-money to rags,--and anon he is bitter upon Malthus, Ricardo,\r\nand the Scotch \"Feelosofers,\"--and closes his anathema with the charming\r\npicture of a wooded \"hanger,\" up which he toils (with curses on the\r\nroad) only to rejoice in the view of a sweet Hampshire valley, over\r\nwhich sleek flocks are feeding, and down which some white stream goes\r\nwinding, and cheating him into a rare memory of his innocent boyhood. He\r\ngains at length his election to Parliament; but he is not a man to\r\nfigure well there, with his impetuosity and lack of self-control. He can\r\ntalk by the hour to those who feel with him; but to be challenged, to\r\nhave his fierce invective submitted to the severe test of an inexorable\r\nlogic,--this limits his audacity; and his audacity once limited, his\r\npower is gone.\r\n\r\nBut I must not forget that I have brought him into my wet-day galaxy as\r\na farmer. His energy, his promptitude, his habits of thrift, would have\r\nmade him one of the best of farmers. His book on gardening is even now\r\none of the most instructive that can be placed in the hands of a\r\nbeginner. He ignores physiology and botany, indeed; he makes crude\r\nerrors on this score; but he had an intuitive sense of the right method\r\nof teaching. He is plain and clear, to a comma. He knows what needs to\r\nbe told; and he tells it straightforwardly. There is no better model for\r\nagricultural writers than \"Cobbett on Gardening.\" There is no miserable\r\nwaste of words,--no indirectness of talk; what he thinks, he prints.\r\n\r\nHis \"Cottage Economy,\" too, is a book which every small landholder in\r\nAmerica should own; there is a sterling merit in it which will not be\r\noutlived. He made a great mistake, it is true, in insisting that\r\nIndian-corn could be grown successfully in England. But being a man who\r\ndid not yield to influences of climate himself, he did not mean that his\r\ncrops should; and if he had been rich enough, I believe that he would\r\nhave covered his farm with a glass roof, rather than yield his\r\nconclusion that Indian-corn could be grown successfully under a British\r\nsky.\r\n\r\nA great, impracticable, earnest, headstrong man, the like of whom does\r\nnot appear a half-dozen times in a century. Being self-educated, he was\r\npossessed, like nearly all self-educated men, of a complacency and a\r\nself-sufficiency which stood always in his way. Affecting to teach\r\ngrammar, he was ignorant of all the etymology of the language; knowing\r\nno word of botany, he classified plants by the \"fearings\" of his\r\nturnip-field. He was vain to the last degree; he thought his books were\r\nthe best books in the world, and that everybody should read them. He was\r\nindustrious, restless, captious, and, although humane at heart, was the\r\nmost malignant slanderer of his time. He called a political antagonist a\r\n\"pimp,\" and thought a crushing argument lay in the word; he called\r\nparsons scoundrels, and bade his boys be regular at church.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1835, while the Parliament was in session, he grew ill,--talked\r\nfeebly about politics and farming, (to his household,) \"wished for 'four\r\ndays' rain' for the Cobbett corn,\" and on Wednesday, (16th June,)\r\ndesired to be carried around the farm, and criticized the work that had\r\nbeen done,--grew feeble as evening drew on, and an hour after midnight\r\nleaned back heavily in his chair, and died.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI must give a paragraph, at least, to the Rev. James Grahame, the good\r\nScotch parson, were it only because he wrote a poem called \"British\r\nGeorgics.\" They are not so good as Virgil's; nor did he ever think it\r\nhimself. In fact, he published his best poem anonymously, and so\r\nfurtively that even his wife took up an early copy, which she found one\r\nday upon her table, and, charmed with its pleasant description of\r\nScottish braes and burn-sides, said, \"Ah! Jemmy, if ye could only mak' a\r\nbook like this!\" And I will venture to say that \"Jemmy\" never had rarer\r\nor pleasanter praise.\r\n\r\nShall we read a little, and test the worth of good Mistress Grahame's\r\njudgment? It is a bit of the parson's walk in \"The Sabbath\":--\r\n\r\n    \"Now, when the downward sun has left the glens,\r\n    Each mountain's rugged lineaments are traced\r\n    Upon the adverse slope, where stalks gigantic\r\n    The shepherd's shadow thrown athwart the chasm,\r\n    As on the topmost ridge he homeward hies.\r\n    How deep the hush! the torrent's channel, dry,\r\n    Presents a stony steep, the echo's haunt.\r\n    But hark a plaintive sound floating along!\r\n    'Tis from yon heath-roofed shieling; now it dies\r\n    Away, now rises full; it is the song\r\n    Which He who listens to the hallelujahs\r\n    Of choiring seraphim delights to hear;\r\n    It is the music of the heart, the voice\r\n    Of venerable age, of guileless youth,\r\n    In kindly circle seated on the ground\r\n    Before their wicker door.\"\r\n\r\nCrabbe, who was as keen an observer of rural scenes, had a much better\r\nfaculty of verse; indeed, he had a faculty of language so large that it\r\ncarried him beyond the real drift of his stories. I do not _know_ the\r\nfact, indeed; but I think, that, notwithstanding the Duke of Rutland's\r\npatronage, Mr. Crabbe must have written inordinately long sermons. It is\r\nstrange how many good men do,--losing point and force and efficiency in\r\na welter of words! If there is one rhetorical lesson which it behooves\r\nall theologic or academic professors to lay down and enforce, (if need\r\nbe with the ferule,) it is this,--Be short. It is amazing the way in\r\nwhich good men lose themselves on Sunday mornings in the lapse of their\r\nown language; and most rarely are we confronted from the pulpit with an\r\nopinion which would not bear stripping of wordy shifts, and be all the\r\nmore comely for its nakedness.\r\n\r\nGeorge Crabbe wrote charming rural tales; but he wrote long ones. There\r\nis minute observation, dramatic force, tender pathos, but there is much,\r\nof tedious and coarse description. If by some subtile alchemy the better\r\nqualities could be thrown down from the turbid and watery flux of his\r\nverse, we should have an admirable pocket-volume for the country; as it\r\nis, his books rest mostly on the shelves, and it requires a strong\r\nbreath to puff away the dust that has gathered on the topmost edges.\r\n\r\nI think of the Reverend Mr. Crabbe as an amiable, absent-minded old\r\ngentleman, driving about on week-days in a heavy, square-topped gig,\r\n(his wife holding the reins,) in search of way-side gypsies, and on\r\nSunday pushing a discourse--which was good up to the \"fourthly\"--into\r\nthe \"seventhly.\"\r\n\r\nCharles Lamb, if he had been clerically disposed, would, I am sure, have\r\nwritten short sermons; and I think that his hearers would have carried\r\naway the gist of them clean and clear.\r\n\r\nHe never wrote anything that could be called strictly pastoral; he was a\r\ncreature of streets and crowding houses; no man could have been more\r\nignorant of the every-day offices of rural life; I doubt if he ever knew\r\nfrom which side a horse was to be mounted or a cow to be milked, and a\r\nsprouting bean was a source of the greatest wonderment to him. Yet, in\r\nspite of all this, what a book those Essays of his make, to lie down\r\nwith under trees! It is the honest, lovable simplicity of his nature\r\nthat makes the keeping good. He is the Izaak Walton of London\r\nstreets,--of print-shops, of pastry-shops, of mouldy book-stalls; the\r\nchime of Bow-bells strikes upon his ear like the chorus of a milkmaid's\r\nsong at Ware.\r\n\r\nThere is not a bit of rodomontade in him about the charms of the\r\ncountry, from beginning to end; if there were, we should despise him. He\r\ncan find nothing to say of Skiddaw but that he is \"a great creature\";\r\nand he writes to Wordsworth, (whose sight is failing,) on Ambleside, \"I\r\nreturn you condolence for your decaying sight,--not for anything there\r\nis to see in the country, but for the miss of the pleasure of reading a\r\nLondon newspaper.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again to his friend Manning, (about the date of 1800,)--\"I am not\r\nromance-bit about _Nature_. The earth and sea and sky (when all is said)\r\nis but as a house to dwell in. If the inmates be courteous, and good\r\nliquors flow like the conduits at an old coronation,--if they can talk\r\nsensibly, and feel properly, I have no need to stand staring upon the\r\ngilded looking-glass, (that strained my friend's purse-strings in the\r\npurchase,) nor his five-shilling print, over the mantel-piece, of old\r\nNabbs, the carrier. Just as important to me (in a sense) is all the\r\nfurniture of my world,--eye-pampering, but satisfies no heart. Streets,\r\nstreets, streets, markets, theatres, churches, Covent Gardens, shops\r\nsparkling with pretty faces of industrious milliners, neat seamstresses,\r\nladies cheapening, gentlemen behind counters lying, authors in the\r\nstreet with spectacles, lamps lit at night, pastry-cooks' and\r\nsilver-smiths' shops, beautiful Quakers of Pentonville, noise of\r\ncoaches, drowsy cry of mechanic watchmen at night, with bucks reeling\r\nhome drunk,--if you happen to wake at midnight, cries of 'Fire!' and\r\n'Stop thief!'--inns of court with their learned air, and halls, and\r\nbutteries, just like Cambridge colleges,--old book-stalls, 'Jeremy\r\nTaylors,' 'Burtons on Melancholy,' and 'Religio Medicis,' on every\r\nstall. These are thy pleasures, O London-with-the-many-sins!--for these\r\nmay Keswick and her giant brood go hang!\"\r\n\r\nAnd again to Wordsworth, in 1830,--\"Let no native Londoner imagine that\r\nhealth, and rest, and innocent occupation, interchange of converse\r\nsweet, and recreative study, can make the country anything better than\r\naltogether odious and detestable.\"\r\n\r\nDoes any weak-limbed country-liver resent this honesty of speech? Surely\r\nnot, if he be earnest in his loves and faith; but, the rather, by such\r\ntoken of unbounded naturalness, he recognizes under the waistcoat of\r\nthis dear, old, charming cockney the traces of close cousinship to the\r\nWaltons, and binds him, and all the simplicity of his talk, to his\r\nheart, for aye. There is never a hillside under whose oaks or chestnuts\r\nI lounge upon a smoky afternoon of August, but a pocket Elia is as\r\ncoveted and as cousinly a companion as a pocket Walton, or a White of\r\nSelborne. And upon wet days in my library, I conjure up the image of the\r\nthin, bent old gentleman--Charles Lamb--to sit over against me, and I\r\nwatch his kindly, beaming eye, as he recites with poor stuttering\r\nvoice,--between the whiffs of his pipe,--over and over, those always new\r\nstories of \"Christ's Hospital,\" and the cherished \"Blakesmoor,\" and\r\n\"Mackery End.\"\r\n\r\n(No, you need not put back the book, my boy; 't is always in place.)\r\n\r\nI never admired greatly James Hogg, the Ettrick Shepherd; yet he belongs\r\nof double right in the coterie of my wet-day preachers. Bred a shepherd,\r\nhe tried farming, and he wrote pastorals. His farming (if we may believe\r\ncontemporary evidence) was by no means so good as his verse. The Ettrick\r\nShepherd of the \"Noctes Ambrosianæ\" is, I fancy, as much becolored by\r\nthe wit of Professor Wilson as any daughter of a duchess whom Sir Joshua\r\nchanged into a nymph. I think of Hogg as a sturdy sheep-tender, growing\r\nrebellious among the Cheviot flocks, crazed by a reading of the Border\r\nminstrelsy, drunken on books, (as his fellows were with \"mountain-dew,\")\r\nand wreaking his vitality on Gaelic rhymes,--which, it is true, have a\r\ncertain blush and aroma of the heather-hills, but which never reached\r\nthe excellence that he fondly imagined belonged to them. I fancy, that,\r\nwhen he sat at the laird's table, (Sir Walter's,) and called the laird's\r\nlady by her baptismal name, and--not abashed in any presence--uttered\r\nhis Gaelic gibes for the wonderment of London guests,--that he thought\r\nfar more of himself than the world has ever been inclined to think of\r\nhim. I know that poets have a privilege of conceit, and that those who\r\nare not poets sometimes assume it; but it is, after all, a sorry\r\nquality by which to win the world's esteem; and when death closes the\r\nrecord, it is apt to insure a large debit against the dead man.\r\n\r\nIt may not be commonly known that the Ettrick Shepherd was an\r\nagricultural author, and wrote \"Hogg on Sheep,\" for which, as he tells\r\nus, he received the sum of eighty-six pounds. It is an octavo book, and\r\nrelates to the care, management, and diseases of the black-faced\r\nmountain-breed, of which alone he was cognizant. It had never a great\r\nreputation; and I think the sheep-farmers of the Cheviots were disposed\r\nto look with distrust upon the teachings of a shepherd who supped with\r\n\"lords\" at Abbotsford, and whose best venture in verse was in \"The\r\nQueen's Wake.\" A British agricultural author, speaking of him in a\r\npitiful way, says,--\"He passed years of busy authorship, and encountered\r\n_the usual difficulties of that penurious mode of life_.\"[32]\r\n\r\nThis is good; it is as good as anything of Hogg's.\r\n\r\nI approach the name of Mr. Loudon, the author of the Encyclopædias of\r\nGardening and Agriculture, with far more of respect. If nothing else in\r\nhim laid claim to regard, his industry, his earnestness, his\r\nindefatigable labor in aid of all that belonged to the progress of\r\nBritish gardening or farming, would demand it. I take a pride, too, in\r\nsaying, that, notwithstanding his literary labors, he was successful as\r\na farmer, during the short period of his farm-holding.\r\n\r\nMr. Loudon was a Scotchman by birth, was educated in Edinburgh, and was\r\nfor a time under the tutelage of Mr. Dickson, the famous nurseryman of\r\nLeith-Walk. Early in the present century he made his first appearance in\r\nLondon,--published certain papers on the laying-out of the public\r\nsquares of the metropolis, and shortly after was employed by the Earl of\r\nMansfield in the arrangement of the palace-gardens at Scone. In 1813 and\r\n'14 he travelled on the Continent very widely, making the gardens of\r\nmost repute the special objects of his study; and in 1822 he published\r\nhis \"Encyclopædia of Gardening\"; that of Agriculture followed shortly\r\nafter, and his book of Rural Architecture in 1833. But these labors,\r\nenormous as they were, had interludes of other periodical work, and were\r\ncrowned at last by his _magnum opus_, the \"Arboretum.\" A man of only\r\nordinary nerve and diligence would have taken a ten years' rest upon the\r\ncompletion of only one of his ponderous octavos; and the wonder is the\r\ngreater, that London wrought in his later years under all the\r\ndisadvantages of appeals from rapacious creditors and the infirmities of\r\na broken constitution. Crippled, palsied, fevered, for a long period of\r\nyears, he still wrought on with a persistence that would have broken\r\nmany a strong man down, and only yielded at last to a bronchial\r\naffection which grappled him at his work.\r\n\r\nThis author massed together an amount of information upon the subjects\r\nof which he treated that is quite unmatched in the whole annals of\r\nagricultural literature. Columella, Heresbach, Worlidge, and even the\r\nwriters of the \"Geoponica,\" dwindle into insignificance in the\r\ncomparison. He is not, indeed, always absolutely accurate on historical\r\npoints;[33] but in all essentials his books are so complete as to have\r\nmade them standard works up to a time long subsequent to their issue.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNo notice of the agricultural literature of the early part of this\r\ncentury would be at all complete without mention of the Magazines and\r\nSociety \"Transactions,\" in which alone some of the best and most\r\nscientific cultivators communicated their experience or suggestions to\r\nthe public. Loudon was himself the editor of the \"Gardener's Magazine\";\r\nand the earlier Transactions of the Horticultural Society are enriched\r\nby the papers of such men as Knight, Van Mons, Sir Joseph Banks, Rev.\r\nWilliam Herbert, Messrs. Dickson, Haworth, Wedgwood, and others. The\r\nworks of individual authors lost ground in comparison with such an array\r\nof reports from scientific observers, and from that time forth\r\nperiodical literature has become the standard teacher in what relates to\r\ngood culture. I do not know what extent of good the newly instituted\r\nAgricultural Colleges of this country may effect; but I feel quite safe\r\nin saying that our agricultural journals will prove always the most\r\neffective teachers of the great mass of the farming-population. The\r\nLondon Horticultural Society at an early day established the Chiswick\r\nGardens, and these, managed under the advice of the Society's Directors,\r\nhave not only afforded an accurate gauge of British progress in\r\nhorticulture, but they have furnished to the humblest cultivator who has\r\nstrolled through their inclosures practical lessons in the craft of\r\ngardening, renewed from month to month and from year to year. It is to\r\nbe hoped that the American Agricultural Colleges will adopt some similar\r\nplan, and illustrate the methods they teach upon lands which shall be\r\nopen to public inspection, and upon whose culture and its successes\r\nsystematic reports shall be annually made. Failing of this, they will\r\nfail of the best part of their proper purpose. Nor would it be a\r\nfruitless work, if, in connection with such experimental farm, a weekly\r\nrecord were issued,--giving analyses of the artificial manures employed,\r\nand a complete register of every field, from the date of its\r\n\"breaking-up\" to the harvesting of the crop. Every new implement,\r\nmoreover, should be reported upon with unwavering impartiality, and no\r\nadvertisements should be received. I think under these conditions we\r\nmight almost look for an honest newspaper.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWriting thus, during these in-door hours, of country-pursuits, and of\r\nthose who have illustrated them, or who have in any way quickened the\r\nedge with which we farmers rasp away the weeds or carve out our pastoral\r\nentertainment, I come upon the names of a great bevy of poets, belonging\r\nto the earlier quarter of this century, that I find it hard to pass by.\r\nMuch as I love to bring to mind, over and over again, \"Ivanhoe\" and\r\n\"Waverley,\" I love quite as much to summon to my view Walter Scott, the\r\nwoodsman of Abbotsford, with hatchet at his girdle, and the hound Maida\r\nin attendance. I see him thinning out the saplings that he has planted\r\nupon the Tweed banks. I know how they stand, having wandered by the hour\r\namong them. I can fancy how the master would have lopped away the boughs\r\nfor a little looplet through which a burst of the blue Eildon Hills\r\nshould come. His favorite seat, overshadowed by an arbor-vitæ, (of which\r\na leaf lies pressed in the \"Scotch Tourist\" yonder,) was so near to the\r\nTweed banks that the ripple of the stream over its pebbly bottom must\r\nhave made a delightful lullaby for the toil-worn old man. But beyond\r\nwood-craft, I could never discover that Sir Walter had any strong\r\nagricultural inclination; nor do I think that the old gentleman had much\r\neye for the picturesque; no landscape-gardener of any reputation would\r\nhave decided upon such a site for such a pile as that of Abbotsford: the\r\nspot is low; the views are not extended or varied; the very trees are\r\nall of Scott's planting: but the master loved the murmur of the\r\nTweed,--loved the nearness of Melrose, and in every old bit of\r\nsculpture that he walled into his home he found pictures of far-away\r\nscenes that printed in vague shape of tower or abbey all his limited\r\nhorizon.\r\n\r\nChristopher North carried his Scotch love of mountains to his home among\r\nthe English lakes. I think he counted Skiddaw something more than \"a\r\ngreat creature.\" In all respects--saving the pipes and the ale--he was\r\nthe very opposite of Charles Lamb. And yet do we love him more? A\r\nstalwart, hearty man, with a great redundance of flesh and blood, who\r\ncould \"put the stone\" with Finlayson, or climb with the hardiest of the\r\nBen-Nevis guides, or cast a fly with the daintiest of the Low-Country\r\nfishers,--redundant of imagination, redundant of speech, and with such\r\nexuberance in him that we feel surfeit from the overflow, as at the\r\nreading of Spenser's \"Faërie Queene,\" and lay him down with a wearisome\r\nsense of mental indigestion.\r\n\r\nNor yet is it so much an indigestion as a feeling of plethora, due less\r\nto the frothiness of the condiments than to a certain fulness of blood\r\nand brawn. The broad-shouldered Christopher, in his shooting-jacket, (a\r\ndingy green velveteen, with pocket-pouches all stuffed,) strides away\r\nalong the skirts of Cruachan or Loch Lochy with such a tearing pace, and\r\ngreets every lassie with such a clamorous outbreak of song, and throws\r\nsuch a wonderful stretch of line upon every pool, and amazes us with\r\nsuch stupendous \"strikes\" and such a whizzing of his reel, that we\r\nfairly lose our breath.\r\n\r\nNot so of the \"White Doe of Rylstone\"; nay, we more incline to doze over\r\nit than to lose our breath. Wilson differs from Wordsworth as Loch Awe,\r\nwith its shaggy savagery of shore, from the Sunday quietude and beauty\r\nof Rydal-Water. The Strid of Wordsworth was bounded by the slaty banks\r\nof the \"Crystal Wharf,\" and the Strid of Wilson, in his best moments,\r\nwas as large as the valley of Glencoe. Yet Wordsworth loved intensely\r\nall the more beautiful aspects of the country, and of country-life. No\r\nangler and no gardener, indeed,--too severely and proudly meditative for\r\nany such sleight-of-hand. The only great weight which he ever lifted, I\r\nsuspect, was one which he carried with him always,--the immense dignity\r\nof his poetic priesthood. His home and its surroundings were fairly\r\ntypical of his tastes: a cottage, (so called,) of homely material\r\nindeed, but with an ambitious elevation of gables and of chimney-stacks;\r\na velvety sheen of turf, as dapper as that of a suburban haberdasher; a\r\nmossy urn or two, patches of flowers, but rather fragrant than showy\r\nones; behind him the loveliest of wooded hills, all toned down by\r\ngraceful culture, and before him the silvery mirrors of Windermere and\r\nRydal-Water.\r\n\r\nWe have to credit him with some rare and tender description, and\r\nfragments of great poems; but I cannot help thinking that he fancied a\r\nprofounder meaning lay in them than the world has yet detected.\r\n\r\nJohn Clare was a contemporary of Wordsworth's, and was most essentially\r\na poet of the fields. His father was a pauper and a cripple; not even\r\nyoung Cobbett was so pressed to the glebe by the circumstances of his\r\nbirth. But the thrushes taught Clare to sing. He wrote verses upon the\r\nlining of his hat-band. He hoarded halfpence to buy Thomson's \"Seasons,\"\r\nand walked seven miles before sunrise to make the purchase. The hardest\r\nfield-toil could not repress the poetic aspirations of such a boy. By\r\ndint of new hoardings he succeeded in printing verses of his own; but\r\nnobody read them. He wrote other verses, which at length made him known.\r\nThe world flattered the peasant-bard of Northamptonshire. A few\r\ndistinguished patrons subscribed the means for equipping a farm of his\r\nown. The heroine of his love-tales became its mistress; a shelf or two\r\nof books made him rich; but in an evil hour he entered upon some\r\nfarm-speculation which broke down; a new poem was sharply criticized or\r\nneglected; the novelty of his peasant's song was over. Disheartened and\r\ngloomy, he was overwhelmed with despondency, and became the inmate of a\r\nmad-house, where for forty years he has staggered idiotically toward the\r\nrest which did not come. But even as I write I see in the British papers\r\nthat he is free at last. Poor Clare is dead.\r\n\r\nWith this sad story in mind, we may read with a zest which perhaps its\r\nmerit alone would not provoke his little sonnet of \"The Thrush's\r\nNest\":--\r\n\r\n    \"Within a thick and spreading hawthorn-bush,\r\n    That overhung a mole-hill large and round,\r\n    I heard from morn to morn a merry thrush\r\n    Sing hymns, of rapture, while I drank the sound\r\n    With joy; and oft, an unintruding guest,\r\n    I watched her secret toils from day to day,--\r\n    How true she warped the moss to form her nest,\r\n    And modelled it within with wood and clay,\r\n    And by-and-by, like heath-bells gilt with dew,\r\n    There lay her shining eggs as bright as flowers,\r\n    Ink-spotted over, shells of green and blue;\r\n    And there I witnessed, in the summer hours,\r\n    A brood of Nature's minstrels chirp and fly,\r\n    Glad as the sunshine and the laughing sky.\"\r\n\r\nThere are pretty snatches of a Southern May in Hunt's poem of \"Rimini,\"\r\nwhere\r\n\r\n                   \"sky, earth, and sea\r\n    Breathe like a bright-eyed face that laughs out openly.\r\n    'T is Nature full of spirits, waked and springing:\r\n    The birds to the delicious tune are singing,\r\n    Darting with freaks and snatches up and down,\r\n    Where the light woods go seaward from the town;\r\n    While happy faces striking through the green\r\n    Of leafy roads at every turn are seen;\r\n    And the far ships, lifting their sails of white\r\n    Like joyful hands, come up with scattery light,\r\n    Come gleaming up true to the wished-for day,\r\n    And chase the whistling brine, and swirl into the bay.\"\r\n\r\nThis does not sound as if it came from the prince of cockneys; and I\r\nhave always felt a certain regard for Leigh Hunt, too, by reason of the\r\ntender story which he gives of the little garden, \"_mio picciol orto_,\"\r\nthat he established during his two years of prisonhood.[34]\r\n\r\nBut, after all, there was no robustness in his rural spirit,--nothing\r\nthat makes the cheek tingle, as if a smart wind had smitten it. He was\r\nborn to handle roses without thorns; I think that with a pretty boudoir,\r\non whose table every morning a pretty maid should arrange a pretty\r\nnosegay, and with a pretty canary to sing songs in a gilded cage, and\r\npretty gold-fish to disport in a crystal vase, and basted partridges for\r\ndinner, his love for the country would have been satisfied. He loved\r\nNature as a sentimental boy loves a fine woman of twice his\r\nyears,--sighing himself away in pretty phrases that flatter, but do not\r\ntouch her; there is nothing to remind, even, of the full, abounding,\r\nfiery, all-conquering love with which a full-grown man meets and marries\r\na yielding maiden.\r\n\r\nIn poor John Keats, however, there _is_ something of this; and under its\r\nheats he consumed away. For ripe, joyous outburst of all rural\r\nfancies,--for keen apprehension of what most takes hold of the\r\nsusceptibilities of a man who loves the country,--for his coinage of all\r\nsweet sounds of birds, all murmur of leaves, all riot and blossoming of\r\nflowers, into fragrant verse,--he was without a peer in his day. It is\r\nnot that he is so true to natural phases in his descriptive epithets,\r\nnot that he sees all, not that he has heard all; but his heart has drunk\r\nthe incense of it, and his imagination refined it, and his fancy set it\r\naflow in those jocund lines which bound and writhe and exult with a\r\npassionate love for the things of field and air.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI close these papers, with my eye resting upon the same stretch of\r\nfields,--the wooded border of a river,--the twinkling roofs and spires\r\nflanked by hills and sea,--where my eye rested when I began this story\r\nof the old masters with Hesiod and the bean-patches of Ithaca. And I\r\ntake a pleasure in feeling that the farm-practice over all the fields\r\nbelow me rests upon the cumulated authorship of so long a line of\r\nteachers. Yon open furrow, over which the herbage has closed, carries\r\ntrace of the ridging in the \"Works and Days\"; the brown field of\r\nhalf-broken clods is the fallow ([Greek: Neos]) of Xenophon; the drills\r\nbelong to Worlidge; their culture with the horse-hoe is at the order of\r\nMaster Tull. Young and Cobbett are full of their suggestions; Lancelot\r\nBrown has ordered away a great straggling hedge-row; and Sir Uvedale\r\nPrice has urged me to spare a hoary maple which lords it over a\r\nhalf-acre of flat land. Cato gives orders for the asparagus, and Switzer\r\nfor the hot-beds. Crescenzi directs the walling, and Smith of Deanston\r\nthe ploughing. Burns embalms all my field-mice, and Cowper drapes an urn\r\nfor me in a tangled wilderness. Knight names my cherries, and Walton,\r\nthe kind master, goes with me over the hill to a wee brook that bounds\r\ndown under hemlocks and soft maples, for \"a contemplative man's\r\nrecreation.\" Davy long ago caught all the fermentation of my manure-heap\r\nin his retort, and Thomson painted for me the scene which is under my\r\nwindow to-day. Mowbray cures the pip in my poultry, and all the songs of\r\nall the birds are caught and repeated to the echo in the pages of the\r\npoets which lie here under my hand; through the prism of their verse,\r\nPatrick the cattle-tender changes to a lithe milkmaid, against whose\r\nankles the buttercups nod rejoicingly, and Rosamund (which is the nurse)\r\nwakes all Arden (which is Edgewood) with a rich burst of laughter.\r\n\r\nAnd shall I not be grateful to these my patrons? And shall I count it\r\nunworthy to pass these few in-door hours of rain in the emblazonment of\r\ntheir titles?\r\n\r\nNor must I forget here to express my indebtedness to those kind friends\r\nwho have from time to time favored me with suggestions or corrections,\r\nin the course of these papers, and to those others--not a few--who have\r\nlent me rare old books of husbandry, which are not easily laid hold of.\r\n\r\nI have discussed no works of living authors, whether of practical or\r\npastoral intent: at some future day I may possibly pay my compliments to\r\nthem. Meantime I cannot help interpolating in the interest of my readers\r\na little fragment of a letter addressed to me within the year by the\r\nlamented Hawthorne:--\"I remember long ago your speaking prospectively of\r\na farm; but I never dreamed of your being really much more of a farmer\r\nthan myself, whose efforts in that line only make me the father of a\r\nprogeny of weeds in a garden-patch. I have about twenty-five acres of\r\nland, seventeen of which are a hill of sand and gravel, wooded with\r\nbirches, locusts, and pitch-pines, and apparently incapable of any other\r\ngrowth; so that I have great comfort in that part of my territory. The\r\nother eight acres are said to be the best land in Concord, and they have\r\nmade me miserable, and would soon have ruined me, if I had not\r\ndetermined nevermore to attempt raising anything from them. So there\r\nthey lie along the roadside, within their broken fence, an eyesore to\r\nme, and a laughing-stock to all the neighbors. If it were not for the\r\ndifficulty of transportation by express or otherwise, I would thankfully\r\ngive you those eight acres.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now the fine, nervous hand, which wrought with such strange power\r\nand beauty, is stilled forever! The eight acres can well lie neglected;\r\nfor upon a broader field, as large as humanity, and at the hands of\r\nthousands of reapers who worked for love, he has gathered in a great\r\nharvest of _immortelles_.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[27] _Life of Sir Humphry Davy_, London, 1839, p. 46.\r\n\r\n[28] See letter of Thomas Poole, p. 322, _Fragmentary Remains of Sir\r\nHumphry Davy_.\r\n\r\n[29] _Salmonia_, p. 5, London, Murray, 1851.\r\n\r\n[30] _Fragmentary Remains_, p. 242.\r\n\r\n[31] _Life and Adventures of Peter Porcupine._\r\n\r\n[32] _Agricultural Biography_, etc. London, 1854. _Printed for the\r\nAuthor._\r\n\r\n[33] I ought, perhaps, to make definite exception in the case of a\r\nwriter so universally accredited. In his \"Encyclopædia of Gardening,\" he\r\nspeaks of the \"Geoponica\" as the work of \"modern Greeks,\" written after\r\nthe transfer of the seat of empire to Constantinople; whereas the bulk\r\nof those treatises were written long before that date. He speaks of\r\nVarro as first in order of time of Roman authors on agriculture; yet\r\nVarro was born 116 B. C., and Cato died as early as 149 B. C. Crescenzi\r\nhe names as an author of the fifteenth century; he should be credited to\r\nthe fourteenth. He also commits the very common error in writers on\r\ngardening, of confounding the Tuscan villa of Pliny with that at\r\nTusculum. These two places of the Roman Consul were entirely distinct\r\nand unlike.\r\n\r\n[34] _Lord Byron and his Contemporaries_, Vol. II. p. 258.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR AND VOLUNTEER OFFICERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant to see how much the present war has done towards effacing\r\nthe traditional jealousy between regular officers and volunteers. The\r\ntwo classes have been so thoroughly intermingled, on staff-duties and in\r\nthe field,--so many regular officers now hold in the volunteer service a\r\nrank higher than their permanent standing,--the whole previous military\r\nexperience of most regulars was so trifling, compared with that which\r\nthey and the volunteers have now shared in common,--and so many young\r\nmen have lately been appointed to commissions, in both branches, not\r\nonly without a West-Point education, but with almost none at all,--that\r\nit really cannot be said that there is much feeling of conscious\r\nseparation left. For treating the two as antagonistic the time has\r\nclearly gone by. For judiciously weighing their respective services in\r\nthe field the epoch has not come, since the reign of history begins only\r\nwhen that of telegrams and special correspondents has ended. It is\r\nbetter, therefore, to limit the comparison, as yet, to that minor\r\nroutine of military duty upon which the daily existence of an army\r\ndepends, and of which the great deeds of daring are merely exciting\r\nepisodes.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the war, and before the distinction was thus\r\npartially effaced, the comparison involved very different elements. In\r\nour general military inexperience, the majority were not disposed to\r\nunderrate the value of specific professional training. Education holds\r\nin this country much of the prestige held by hereditary rank in Europe,\r\nmodified only by the condition that the possessor shall take no undue\r\nairs upon himself. Even then the penalty consists only in a few\r\noutbreaks of superficial jealousy, and the substantial respect for any\r\nreal acquirements remains the same. So there was a time when the\r\nfaintest aroma of West Point lent a charm to the most unattractive\r\ncandidate for a commission. Any Governor felt a certain relief in\r\nintrusting a regiment to any man who had ever eaten clandestine oysters\r\nat Benny Haven's, or had once heard the whiz of an Indian arrow on the\r\nfrontier, however mediocre might have been all his other claims to\r\nconfidence. If he failed, the regular army might bear the shame; if he\r\nsucceeded, to the State-House be the glory.\r\n\r\nYet there was always another party of critics, not less intelligent, who\r\nurged the value of general preparations for any duty, as compared with\r\nspecial,--who held that it was always easier for a man of brains to\r\nacquire technical skill than for a person of mere technicality to\r\nsuperadd brains, and that the antecedents of a frontier lieutenant were,\r\non the whole, a poorer training for large responsibilities than those of\r\nmany a civilian, who had lived in the midst of men, though out of\r\nuniform. Let us have a fair statement of this position, for it was very\r\nsincere and had much temporary influence. The main thing, it was argued,\r\nwas the knowledge of human nature and the habit of dealing with mankind\r\nin masses,--the very thing from which the younger regular officers at\r\nleast had been rigidly excluded. From a monastic life at West Point they\r\nhad usually been transferred to a yet more isolated condition, in some\r\nobscure outpost,--or if otherwise, then they had seen no service at all,\r\nand were mere clerks in shoulder-straps. But a lawyer who could\r\nmanoeuvre fifty witnesses as if they were one,--a teacher used to\r\ngoverning young men by the hundred,--an orator trained to sway\r\nthousands,--a master-mechanic,--a railway-superintendent,--a\r\nfactory-agent,--a broker who could harness Wall Street and drive it,--a\r\nfinancier who could rule a sovereign State with a rod of (railway)\r\niron,--such men as these, it was plausibly reasoned, could give an\r\naverage army-officer all the advantage of his special training, at the\r\nstart, and yet beat him at his own trade in a year.\r\n\r\nThese theories were naturally strengthened, moreover, by occasional\r\ninstances of conspicuous failure, when volunteer troops were intrusted\r\nto regular officers. These disappointments could usually be traced to\r\nvery plain causes. The men selected were sometimes men whose West-Point\r\ncareer would hardly bear minute investigation,--or who had in civil\r\npursuits forgotten all they had learned at the Academy, except\r\nself-esteem,--or who had been confined to the duties of some special\r\ndepartment, as quartermasters or paymasters, and were really fitted for\r\nnothing else,--or who had served their country by resigning their\r\ncommissions, if not by holding them,--or who had contrived, first or\r\nlast, to lose hopelessly their tempers or their digestions, or their\r\nfaith, hope, and charity. Beyond all this lay the trouble, that the best\r\nregular officer from the very fact of his superior training was puzzled\r\nto know how much to demand of volunteer troops, or what standard to\r\nenforce upon them. It was a problem in the Differential Calculus, with\r\nthe Army Regulations for a constant, and a raw volunteer regiment for a\r\nvariable, and not a formula in Davies which suited the purpose.\r\nUnfortunately, these perplexities were quite as apt to end in relaxation\r\nas in rigor, so that the regiments thus commanded sometimes slid into a\r\nlooseness of which a resolute volunteer officer would have been ashamed.\r\n\r\nThese were among the earlier results. Against them was to be set the\r\nfact, that, on the whole, no regiments in the field made progress so\r\nrapid, or held their own so well, as those placed under regular\r\nofficers. And now that three years have abolished many surmises, and\r\nturned many others into established facts, it must be owned that the\r\ntotal value of the professional training has proved far greater, and\r\nthat of the general preparation far less, than many intelligent\r\nobservers predicted. The relation between officer and soldier is\r\nsomething so different in kind from anything which civil life has to\r\noffer, that it has proved almost impossible to transfer methods or\r\nmaxims from the one to the other. If a regiment is merely a caucus, and\r\nthe colonel the chairman,--or merely a fire-company, and the colonel the\r\nforeman,--or merely a prayer-meeting, and the colonel the moderator,--or\r\nmerely a bar-room, and the colonel the landlord,--then the failure of\r\nthe whole thing is a foregone conclusion. War is not the highest of\r\nhuman pursuits, certainly; but an army comes very near to being the\r\ncompletest of human organizations, and he alone succeeds in it who\r\nreadily accepts its inevitable laws, and applies them. An army is an\r\naristocracy, on a three-years' lease, supposing that the period of\r\nenlistment. No mortal skill can make military power effective on\r\ndemocratic principles. A democratic people can perhaps carry on a war\r\nlonger and better than any other; because no other can so well\r\ncomprehend the object, raise the means, or bear the sacrifices. But\r\nthese sacrifices include the surrender, for the time being, of the\r\nessential principle of the government. Personal independence in the\r\nsoldier, like personal liberty in the civilian, must be waived for the\r\npreservation of the nation. With shipwreck staring men in the face, the\r\nchoice lies between despotism and anarchy, trusting to the common sense\r\nof those concerned, when the danger is over, to revert to the old\r\nsafeguards. It is precisely because democracy is an advanced stage in\r\nhuman society, that war, which belongs to a less advanced stage, is\r\npeculiarly inconsistent with its habits. Thus the undemocratic\r\ncharacter, so often lamented in West Point and Annapolis, is in reality\r\ntheir strong point. Granted that they are no more appropriate to our\r\nstage of society than are revolvers and bowie-knives, that is precisely\r\nwhat makes them all serviceable in time of war. War being exceptional,\r\nthe institutions which train its officers must be exceptional likewise.\r\n\r\nThe first essential for military authority lies in the power of\r\ncommand,--a power which it is useless to analyze, for it is felt\r\ninstinctively, and it is seen in its results. It is hardly too much to\r\nsay, that, in military service, if one has this power, all else becomes\r\nsecondary; and it is perfectly safe to say that without it all other\r\ngifts are useless. Now for the exercise of power there is no preparation\r\nlike power, and nowhere is this preparation to be found, in this\r\ncommunity, except in regular army-training. Nothing but great personal\r\nqualities can give a man by nature what is easily acquired by young men\r\nof very average ability who are systematically trained to command.\r\n\r\nThe criticism habitually made upon our army by foreign observers at the\r\nbeginning of the war continues still to be made, though in a rather less\r\ndegree,--that the soldiers are relatively superior to the officers, so\r\nthat the officers lead, perhaps, but do not command them. The reason is\r\nplain. Three years are not long enough to overcome the settled habits of\r\ntwenty years. The weak point of our volunteer service invariably lies\r\nhere, that the soldier, in nine cases out of ten, utterly detests being\r\ncommanded, while the officer, in his turn, equally shrinks from\r\ncommanding. War, to both, is an episode in life, not a profession, and\r\ntherefore military subordination, which needs for its efficiency to be\r\nfixed and absolute, is, by common consent, reduced to a minimum. The\r\nwhite American soldier, being, doubtless, the most intelligent in the\r\nworld, is more ready than any other to comply with a reasonable order,\r\nbut he does it because it is reasonable, not because it is an order.\r\nWith advancing experience his compliance increases, but it is still\r\nbecause he better and better comprehends the reason. Give him an order\r\nthat looks utterly unreasonable,--and this is sometimes necessary,--or\r\ngive him one which looks trifling, under which head all sanitary\r\nprecautions are yet too apt to rank, and you may, perhaps, find that you\r\nstill have a free and independent citizen to deal with, not a soldier.\r\n_Implicit_ obedience must be admitted still to be a rare quality in our\r\narmy; nor can we wonder at it. In many cases there is really no more\r\ndifference between officers and men, in education or in breeding, than\r\nif the one class were chosen by lot from the other; all are from the\r\nsame neighborhood, all will return to the same civil pursuits side by\r\nside; every officer knows that in a little while each soldier will again\r\nbecome his client or his customer, his constituent or his rival. Shall\r\nhe risk offending him for life in order to carry out some hobby of\r\nstricter discipline? If this difficulty exist in the case of\r\ncommissioned officers, it is still more the case with the\r\nnon-commissioned, those essential intermediate links in the chain of\r\nauthority. Hence the discipline of our soldiers has been generally that\r\nof a town-meeting or of an engine-company, rather than that of an army;\r\nand it shows the extraordinary quality of the individual men, that so\r\nmuch has been accomplished with such a formidable defect in the\r\norganization. Even granting that there has been a great and constant\r\nimprovement, the evil is still vast enough. And every young man trained\r\nat West Point enters the service with at least this advantage, that he\r\nhas been brought up to command, and has not that task to learn.\r\n\r\nHe has this further advantage, that he is brought up with some respect\r\nfor the army-organization as it is, with its existing rules, methods,\r\nand proprieties, and is not, like the newly commissioned civilian,\r\ndisposed in his secret soul to set aside all its proprieties as mere\r\n\"pipe-clay,\" its methods as \"old-fogyism,\" and its rules as \"red-tape.\"\r\nHow many good volunteer officers will admit, if they speak candidly,\r\nthat on entering the service they half believed the \"Army Regulations\"\r\nto be a mass of old-time rubbish, which they would gladly reëdit, under\r\ncontract, with immense improvements, in a month or two,--and that they\r\nfinally left the service with the conviction that the same book was a\r\nmine of wisdom, as yet but half explored! Certainly, when one thinks\r\nfor what a handful of an army our present military system was devised,\r\nand with what an admirable elasticity it has borne this sudden and\r\nstupendous expansion, it must be admitted to have most admirably stood\r\nthe test. Of course, there has been much amendment and alteration\r\nneeded, nor is the work done yet; but it has mainly touched the details,\r\nnot the general principles. The system is wonderfully complete for its\r\nown ends, and the more one studies it the less one sneers. Many a form\r\nwhich at first seems to the volunteer officer merely cumbrous and\r\ntrivial he learns to prize at last as almost essential to good\r\ndiscipline; he seldom attempts a short cut without finding it the\r\nlongest way, and rarely enters on that heroic measure of cutting\r\nred-tape without finding at last that he has entangled his own fingers\r\nin the process.\r\n\r\nMore thorough training tells in another way. It is hard to appreciate,\r\nwithout the actual experience, how much of military life is a matter of\r\nmere detail. The maiden at home fancies her lover charging at the head\r\nof his company, when in reality he is at that precise moment endeavoring\r\nto convince his company-cooks that salt-junk needs five hours' boiling,\r\nor is anxiously deciding which pair of worn-out trousers shall be\r\nejected from a drummer-boy's knapsack. Courage is, no doubt, a good\r\nquality in a soldier, and luckily not often wanting; but, in the long\r\nrun, courage depends largely on the haversack. Men are naturally brave,\r\nand when the crisis comes, almost all men will fight well, if well\r\ncommanded. As Sir Philip Sidney said, an army of stags led by a lion is\r\nmore formidable than an army of lions led by a stag. Courage is cheap;\r\nthe main duty of an officer is to take good care of his men, so that\r\nevery one of them shall be ready, at a moment's notice, for any\r\nreasonable demand. A soldier's life usually implies weeks and months of\r\nwaiting, and then one glorious hour; and if the interval of leisure has\r\nbeen wasted, there is nothing but a wasted heroism at the end, and\r\nperhaps not even that. The penalty for misused weeks, the reward for\r\nlaborious months, may be determined within ten minutes. Without\r\ndiscipline an army is a mob, and the larger the worse; without rations\r\nthe men are empty uniforms; without ammunition they might as well have\r\nno guns; without shoes they might almost as well have no legs. And it is\r\nin the practical appreciation of all these matters that the superiority\r\nof the regular officer is apt to be shown.\r\n\r\nAlmost any honest volunteer officer will admit, that, although the\r\ntactics were easily learned, yet, in dealing with all other practical\r\ndetails of army-life, he was obliged to gain his knowledge through many\r\nblunders. There were a thousand points on which the light of Nature,\r\neven aided by \"Army Regulations,\" did not sufficiently instruct him; and\r\nhis best hints were probably obtained by frankly consulting regular\r\nofficers, even if inferior in rank. The advantage of a West-Point\r\ntraining is precisely that of any other professional education. There is\r\nnothing in it which any intelligent man cannot learn for himself in\r\nlater life; nevertheless, the intelligent man would have fared a good\r\ndeal better, had he learned it all in advance. Test it by shifting the\r\npositions. No lawyer would trust his case to a West-Point graduate,\r\nwithout evidence of thorough special preparation. Yet he himself enters\r\non a career equally new to him, where his clients may be counted by\r\nthousands, and every case is capital. The army is a foreign country to\r\ncivilians; of course you can learn the language after your arrival, but\r\nhow you envy your companion, who, having spoken it from childhood, can\r\nproceed at once to matters more important!\r\n\r\nYet the great advantage of the regular army does not, after all, consist\r\nmerely in any superiority of knowledge, or in the trained habit of\r\ncommand. Granting that patience and labor can readily supply these to\r\nthe volunteer, the trouble remains, that even in labor and patience the\r\nregular officer is apt to have the advantage, by reason of a stronger\r\nstimulus. The difference is not merely in the start, but in the pace. No\r\nman can be often thrown into the society of regular officers, especially\r\namong the younger ones, without noticing a higher standard of\r\nprofessional earnestness than that found among average volunteers; and\r\nin this respect a West-Point training makes little or no difference. The\r\nreason of the superiority is obvious. To the volunteer, the service is\r\nstill an episode; to the regular, a permanent career. No doubt, if a man\r\nis thoroughly conscientious, or thoroughly ambitious, or thoroughly\r\nenthusiastic, a temporary pursuit may prove as absorbing as if it were\r\ntaken up for life; but the majority of men, however well-meaning, are\r\nnot thorough at all. How often one hears the apology made by volunteer\r\nofficers, even those of high rank,--\"Military life is not my profession;\r\nI entered the army from patriotism, willing to serve my country\r\nfaithfully for three years, but of course not pretending to perfection\r\nin every trivial detail of a pursuit which I shall soon quit forever.\"\r\nBut it is patriotism to think the details _not_ trivial. If one gives\r\none's self to one's country, let the gift be total and noble. These\r\ndetails are worthy to absorb the whole daily thought, and they should\r\nabsorb it, until more thorough comprehension and more matured executive\r\npower leave room for larger studies, still in the line of the adopted\r\noccupation. If a man leaves his office or his study to be a soldier, let\r\nhim be a soldier in earnest. Let those three years bound the horizon of\r\nhis plans, and let him study his new duty as if earth offered no other\r\nconceivable career. The scholar must forswear his pen, the lawyer his\r\nbooks, the politician his arts. An officer of whatever rank, who does\r\nnot find occupation enough for every day, amid the quietest\r\nwinter-quarters, in the prescribed duties of his position and the\r\nstudies to which they should lead, is fitted only for civil pursuits,\r\nand had better return to them.\r\n\r\nWithout this thoroughness, life in the army affords no solid\r\ncontentment. What is called military glory is a fitful and uncertain\r\nthing. Time and the newspapers play strange tricks with reputations, and\r\nof a hundred officers whose names appear with honor in this morning's\r\ndespatches ninety may never be mentioned again till it is time to write\r\ntheir epitaphs. Who, for instance, can recite the names of the\r\nsuccessive cavalry-commanders who have ridden on their bold forays\r\nthrough Virginia, since the war began? All must give place to the latest\r\nKautz or Sheridan, who has eclipsed without excelling them all. Yet each\r\nis as brave and as faithful to-day, no doubt, as when he too glittered\r\nfor his hour before all men's gaze, and the obscurer duty may be the\r\nmore substantial honor. So when I lift my eyes to look on yonder level\r\nocean-floor, the fitful sunshine now glimmers white on one far-off sail,\r\nnow on another; and yet I know that all canvas looks snowy while those\r\ncasual rays are on it, and that the best vessel is that which, sunlit or\r\nshaded, best accomplishes its destined course. The officer is almost as\r\npowerless as the soldier to choose his opportunity or his place.\r\nMilitary glory may depend on a thousand things,--the accident of local\r\nposition, the jealousy of a rival, the whim of a superior. But the merit\r\nof having done one's whole duty to the men whose lives are in one's\r\nkeeping, and to the nation whose life is staked with theirs,--of having\r\nheld one's command in such a state, that, if at any given moment it was\r\nnot performing the most brilliant achievement, it might have been,--this\r\nis the substantial triumph which every faithful officer has always\r\nwithin reach.\r\n\r\nNow will any one but a newspaper flatterer venture to say that this is\r\nthe habitual standard in our volunteer service? Take as a test the\r\nmanner in which official inspections are usually regarded by a\r\nregimental commander. These occasions are to him what examinations by\r\nthe School Committee are to a public-school teacher. He may either\r\ndeprecate and dodge them, or he may manfully welcome them as the very\r\nbest means of improvement for all under his care. Which is the more\r\ncommon view? What sight more pitiable than to behold an officer begging\r\noff from inspection because he has just come in from picket, or is just\r\ngoing out on picket, or has just removed camp, or was a day too late\r\nwith his last requisition for cartridges? No doubt it is a trying ordeal\r\nto have some young regular-army lieutenant ride up to your tent at an\r\nhour's notice, and leisurely devote a day to probing every weak spot in\r\nyour command,--to stand by while he smells at every camp-kettle, detects\r\nevery delinquent gun-sling, ferrets out old shoes from behind the\r\nmess-bunks, spies out every tent-pole not labelled with the sergeant's\r\nname, asks to see the cash-balance of each company-fund, and perplexes\r\nyour best captain on forming from two ranks into one by the left flank.\r\nYet it is just such unpleasant processes as these which are the\r\nsalvation of an army; these petty mortifications are the fulcrum by\r\nwhich you can lift your whole regiment to a first-class rank, if you\r\nhave only the sense to use them. So long as no inspecting officer needs\r\ntwice to remind you of the same thing, you have no need to blush. But\r\nthough you be the bravest of the brave, though you know a thousand\r\nthings of which he is utterly ignorant, yet so long as he can tell you\r\none thing which you ought to know, he is master of the situation. He may\r\nbe the most conceited little popinjay who ever strutted in uniform; no\r\nmatter; it is more for your interest to learn than for his to teach. Let\r\nour volunteer officers, as a body, once resolve to act on this\r\nprinciple, and we shall have such an army as the world never saw. But\r\nnothing costs the nation a price so fearful, in money or in men, as the\r\nfalse pride which shrinks from these necessary surgical operations, or\r\nregards the surgeon as a foe.\r\n\r\nIt is not being an officer to wear uniform for three years, to draw\r\none's pay periodically, and to acquit one's self without shame during a\r\nfew hours or days of actual battle. History will never record what fine\r\nregiments have been wasted and ruined, since this war began, by the\r\nnegligence in camp of commanders who were brave as Bayard in the field.\r\nUnless a man is willing to concentrate his whole soul upon learning and\r\nperforming the humblest as well as the most brilliant functions of his\r\nnew profession, a true officer he will never become. More time will not\r\nhelp him; for time seldom does much for one who enters, especially in\r\nmiddle life, on an employment for which he is essentially unfitted. It\r\nis amusing to see the weight attached to the name of veteran, in\r\nmilitary matters, by persons who in civil life are very ready to\r\nexchange a veteran doctor or minister for his younger rival. Military\r\nseniority, though the only practicable rule of precedence, is liable to\r\nmany notorious inconveniences. It is especially without meaning in the\r\nvolunteer service, where the Governor of Maine may happen to date a set\r\nof commissions on the first day of January, and His Excellency of\r\nMinnesota may doom his contemporary regiment to life-long subordination\r\nby accidentally postponing theirs to the second day. But it has\r\nsufficient drawbacks even where all the appointments pass through one\r\nchannel. The dignity it gives is a merely chronological distinction,--an\r\noldest-inhabitant renown,--much like the university-degree of A. M.,\r\nwhich simply implies that a man has got decently through college, and\r\nthen survived three years. But if a man was originally placed in a\r\nposition beyond his deserts, the mere lapse of time may have only made\r\nhim the more dangerous charlatan. If he showed no sign of military\r\naptitude in six months, a probation of three years may have been more\r\ncostly, but not more conclusive. Add to this the fact that each\r\nsuccessive year of the war has seen all officers more carefully\r\nselected, if only because there has been more choice of material; so\r\nthat there is sometimes a temptation in actual service, were it\r\npracticable, to become Scriptural in our treatment, and put the last\r\nfirst and the first last. In those unfortunate early days, when it\r\nseemed to most of our Governors to make little difference whom they\r\ncommissioned, since all were alike untried, and of two evils it was\r\nnatural to choose that which would produce the more agreeable\r\nconsequences at the next election-time,--in those days of darkness many\r\nvery poor officers saw the light. Many of these have since been happily\r\ndischarged or judiciously shelved. The trouble is, that those who remain\r\nare among the senior officers in our volunteer army, in their respective\r\ngrades. They command posts, brigades, divisions. They preside at\r\ncourt-martials. Beneath the shadow of their notorious incompetency all\r\nminor evils may lurk undetected. To crown all, they are, in many cases,\r\nsincere and well-meaning men, utterly obtuse as to their own\r\ndeficiencies, and manifesting (to employ a witticism coeval with\r\nthemselves) all the Christian virtues except that of resignation.\r\n\r\nThe present writer has beheld the spectacle of an officer of high rank,\r\npreviously eminent in civil life, who could only vindicate himself\r\nbefore a court-martial from the ruinous charge of false muster by\r\nsummoning a staff-officer to prove that it was his custom to sign all\r\nmilitary papers without looking at them. He has seen a lieutenant tried\r\nfor neglect of duty in allowing a soldier under his command, at an\r\nimportant picket-post, to be found by the field-officer of the day with\r\ntwo inches of sand in the bottom of his gun,--and pleading, in\r\nmitigation of sentence, that it had never been the practice in his\r\nregiment to make any inspection of men detailed for such duty. That such\r\ninstances of negligence should be tolerated for six months in any\r\nregiment of regulars is a thing almost inconceivable, and yet in these\r\ncases the regiments and the officers had been nearly three years in\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nIt is to be remembered that even the command of a regiment of a thousand\r\nmen is a first-class administrative position, and that there is no\r\nemployer of men in civil life who assumes the responsibility of those\r\nunder his command so absolutely and thoroughly. The life, the health,\r\nthe efficiency, the finances, the families of his soldiers, are staked\r\nnot so much on the courage of a regimental commander as upon his\r\ndecision, his foresight, and his business-habits. As Richter's worldly\r\nold statesman tells his son, \"War trains a man to business.\" If he takes\r\nhis training slowly, he must grow perfect through suffering,--commonly\r\nthe suffering of other people. The varied and elaborate returns, for\r\ninstance, now required of officers,--daily, monthly, quarterly,\r\nannually,--are not one too many as regards the interests of Government\r\nand of the soldiers, but are enough to daunt any but an accurate and\r\nmethodical man. A single error in an ordnance requisition may send a\r\nbody of troops into action with only twenty rounds of ammunition to a\r\nman. One mistake in a property-voucher may involve an officer in\r\nstoppages exceeding his yearly pay. One wrong spelling in a muster-roll\r\nmay beggar a soldier's children ten years after the father has been\r\nkilled in battle. Under such circumstances no standard of accuracy can\r\nbe too high. And yet even the degree of regularity that now exists is\r\ndue more to the constant pressure from head-quarters than to any\r\nindividual zeal. For a large part of this pressure the influence of the\r\nregular army is responsible,--those officers usually occupying the more\r\nimportant staff-positions, and having in some departments of service,\r\nespecially in the ordnance, moulded and remoulded the whole machinery\r\nuntil it has become almost a model. It would be difficult to name\r\nanything in civil life which is in its way so perfect as the present\r\nsystem of business and of papers in this department. Every ordnance\r\nblank now contains a schedule of instructions for its own use, so simple\r\nand so minute that it seems as if, henceforward, the most negligent\r\nvolunteer officer could never make another error. And yet in the very\r\nlast set of returns which the writer had occasion to revise,--returns\r\nmade by a very meritorious captain,--there were eight different papers,\r\nand a mistake in every one.\r\n\r\nThe glaring defeat of most of our volunteer regiments, from the\r\nbeginning to this day, has lain in slovenliness and remissness as to\r\nevery department of military duty, except the actual fighting and dying.\r\nWhen it comes to that ultimate test, our men usually endure it so\r\nmagnificently that one is tempted to overlook all deficiencies on\r\nintermediate points. But they must not be overlooked, because they\r\ncreate a fearful discount on the usefulness of our troops, when tried by\r\nthe standard of regular armies. I do not now refer to the niceties of\r\ndress-parade or the courtesies of salutation: it has long since been\r\ntacitly admitted that a white American soldier will not present arms to\r\nany number of rows of buttons, if he can by any ingenuity evade it; and\r\nto shoulder arms on passing an officer is something to which only\r\nEthiopia or the regular army can attain. Grant, if you please, (though I\r\ndo not grant,) that these are merely points of foolish punctilio. But\r\nthere are many things which are more than punctilio, though they may be\r\nless than fighting. The efficiency of a body of troops depends, after\r\nall, not so much on its bravery as on the condition of its sick-list. A\r\nregiment which does picket-duty faithfully will often avoid the need of\r\nduties more terrible. Yet I have ridden by night along a chain of ten\r\nsentinels, every one of whom should have taken my life rather than\r\npermit me to give the countersign without dismounting, and have been\r\nrequired to dismount by only four, while two did not ask me for the\r\ncountersign at all, and two others were asleep. I have ridden through a\r\nregimental camp whose utterly filthy condition seemed enough to send\r\nmalaria through a whole military department, and have been asked by the\r\ncolonel, almost with tears in his eyes, to explain to him why his men\r\nwere dying at the rate of one a day. The latter was a regiment nearly a\r\nyear old, and the former one of almost two years' service, and just from\r\nthe old Army of the Potomac.\r\n\r\nThe fault was, of course, in the officers. The officer makes the\r\ncommand, as surely as, in educational matters, the teacher makes the\r\nschool. There is not a regiment in the army so good that it could not be\r\nutterly spoiled in three months by a poor commander, nor so poor that it\r\ncould not be altogether transformed in six by a good one. The difference\r\nin material is nothing,--white or black, German or Irish; so potent is\r\nmilitary machinery that an officer who knows his business can make good\r\nsoldiers out of almost anything, give him but a fair chance. The\r\ndifference between the present Army of the Potomac and any previous\r\none,--the reason why we do not daily hear, as in the early campaigns, of\r\nirresistible surprises, overwhelming numbers, and masked batteries,--the\r\nreason why the present movements are a tide and not a wave,--is not that\r\nthe men are veterans, but that the officers are. There is an immense\r\namount of perfectly raw material in General Grant's force, besides the\r\ncolored regiments, which in that army are all raw, but in which the\r\nCopperhead critics have such faith they would gladly select them for\r\ndangers fit for Napoleon's Old Guard. But the newest recruit soon grows\r\nsteady with a steady corporal at his elbow, a well-trained sergeant\r\nbehind him, and a captain or a colonel whose voice means something to\r\ngive commands.\r\n\r\nThis reference to the colored troops suggests the false impression,\r\nstill held by many, that special opposition to this important military\r\norganization has been made by regular officers. There is no justice in\r\nthis. While it is very probable that regular officers, as a class, may\r\nhave had stronger prejudices on this point than others have held, yet it\r\nis to be remembered that the chief obstacles have not come from them,\r\nnor from military men of any kind, but from civilians at home. Nothing\r\nhas been more remarkable than the facility with which the expected\r\naversion of the army everywhere vanished before the admirable behavior\r\nof the colored troops, and the substantial value of the reinforcements\r\nthey brought. When it comes to the simple question whether a soldier\r\nshall go on duty every night or every other night, he is not critical as\r\nto beauty of complexion in the soldier who relieves him.\r\n\r\nSome regular officers may have been virulently opposed to the employment\r\nof negroes as soldiers, though the few instances which I have known have\r\nbeen far more than compensated by repeated acts of the most substantial\r\nkindness from many others. But I never have met one who did not express\r\ncontempt for the fraud thus far practised by Government on a portion of\r\nthese troops, by refusing to pay them the wages which the Secretary of\r\nWar had guarantied. This is a wrong which, but for good discipline,\r\nwould have long since converted our older colored regiments into a mob\r\nof mutineers, and which, while dishonestly saving the Government a few\r\nthousand dollars, has virtually sacrificed hundreds of thousands in its\r\ndiscouraging effect upon enlistments, at a time when the fate of the\r\nnation may depend upon a few regiments more or less. It is in vain for\r\nnational conventions to make capital by denouncing massacres like that\r\nof Fort Pillow, and yet ignore this more deliberate injustice for which\r\nsome of their own members are in part responsible. The colored soldiers\r\nwill take their own risk of capture and maltreatment very readily,\r\n(since they must take it on themselves at any rate,) if the Government\r\nwill let its justice begin at home, and pay them their honest earnings.\r\nIt is of little consequence to a dying man whether any one else is to\r\ndie by retaliation, but it is of momentous consequence whether his wife\r\nand family are to be cheated of half his scanty earnings by the nation\r\nfor which he dies. The Rebels may be induced to concede the negro the\r\nrights of war, when we grant him the ordinary rights of peace, namely,\r\nto be paid the price agreed upon. Jefferson Davis and the London\r\n\"Times\"--one-half whose stock-in-trade is \"the inveterate meanness of\r\nthe Yankee\"--will hardly be converted to sound morals by the rebukes of\r\nan administration which allows its Secretary of War to promise a black\r\nsoldier thirteen dollars a month, pay him seven, and shoot him if he\r\ngrumbles. From this crowning injustice the regular army, and, indeed,\r\nthe whole army, is clear; to civilians alone belongs this carnival of\r\nfraud.\r\n\r\nIf, in some instances, terrible injustice has been done to the black\r\nsoldiers in their military treatment also, it has not been only, or\r\nchiefly, under regular officers. Against the cruel fatigue duty imposed\r\nupon them last summer, in the Department of the South, for instance,\r\nmust be set the more disastrous mismanagements of the Department of the\r\nGulf,--the only place from which we now hear the old stories of disease\r\nand desertion,--all dating back to the astonishing blunder of organizing\r\nthe colored regiments of half-size at the outset, with a full complement\r\nof officers. This measure, however agreeable it might have been to the\r\nhorde of aspirants for commissions, was in itself calculated to destroy\r\nall self-respect in the soldiers, being based on the utterly baseless\r\nassumption that they required twice as many officers as whites, and was\r\nforedoomed to failure, because no _esprit de corps_ can be created in a\r\nregiment which is from the first insignificant in respect to size. It is\r\nscarcely conceivable that any regular officer should have honestly\r\nfallen into such an error as this; and it is very certain that the\r\nwisest suggestions and the most efficient action have proceeded, since\r\nthe beginning, from them. It will be sufficient to mention the names of\r\nMajor-General Hunter, Brigadier-General Phelps, and Adjutant-General\r\nThomas; and one there is whose crowning merits deserve a tribute\r\ndistinct even from these.\r\n\r\nWhen some future Bancroft or Motley writes with philosophic brain and\r\npoet's hand the story of the Great Civil War, he will find the\r\ntransition to a new era in our nation's history to have been fitly\r\nmarked by one festal day,--that of the announcement of the President's\r\nProclamation, upon Port-Royal Island, on the first of January, 1863.\r\nThat New-Year's time was our second contribution to the great series of\r\nhistoric days, beads upon the rosary of the human race, permanent\r\nfestivals of freedom. Its celebration was one beside whose simple\r\npageant the superb festivals of other lands might seem but glittering\r\ncounterfeits. Beneath a majestic grove of the great live-oaks which\r\nglorify the South-Carolina soil a liberated people met to celebrate\r\ntheir own peaceful emancipation. They came thronging, by land and water,\r\nfrom plantations which their own self-imposed and exemplary industry was\r\nbeginning already to redeem. The military escort which surrounded them\r\nhad been organized out of their own numbers, and had furnished to the\r\nnation the first proof of the capacity of their race to bear arms. The\r\nkey-note of the meeting was given by spontaneous voices, whose\r\nunexpected anthem took the day from the management of well-meaning\r\npatrons, and swept all away into the great currents of simple feeling.\r\nIt was a scene never to be forgotten: the moss-hung trees, with their\r\nhundred-feet diameter of shade; the eager faces of women and children in\r\nthe foreground; the many-colored headdresses; the upraised hands; the\r\nneat uniforms of the soldiers; the outer row of mounted officers and\r\nladies; and beyond all the blue river, with its swift, free tide. And at\r\nthe centre of all this great and joyous circle stood modestly the man on\r\nwhose personal integrity and energy, more than on any President or\r\nCabinet, the hopes of all that multitude appeared to rest,--who\r\ncommanded then among his subjects, and still commands, an allegiance\r\nmore absolute than any European potentate can claim,--whose name will be\r\nforever illustrious as having first made a practical reality out of that\r\nProclamation which then was to the President only an autograph, and to\r\nthe Cabinet only a dream,--who, when the whole fate of the slaves and of\r\nthe Government hung trembling in the balance, decided it forever by\r\nthrowing into the scale the weight of one resolute man,--who personally\r\nmustered in the first black regiment, and personally governed the\r\nfirst community where emancipation was a success,--who taught the\r\nrelieved nation, in fine, that there was strength and safety\r\nin those dusky millions who till then had been an incubus and a\r\nterror,--Brigadier-General Rufus Saxton, Military Governor of South\r\nCarolina. The single career of this one man more than atones for all the\r\ntraitors whom West Point ever nurtured, and awards the highest place on\r\nthe roll of our practical statesmanship to the regular army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TOTAL DEPRAVITY OF INANIMATE THINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am confident, that, at the annunciation of my theme, Andover,\r\nPrinceton, and Cambridge will skip like rams, and the little hills of\r\nEast Windsor, Meadville, and Fairfax, like lambs. However\r\ndivinity-schools may refuse to \"skip\" in unison, and may butt and batter\r\neach other about the doctrine and origin of _human_ depravity, all will\r\njoin devoutly in the _credo_, I believe in the total depravity of\r\ninanimate things.\r\n\r\nThe whole subject lies in a nutshell, or rather an apple-skin. We have\r\nclerical authority for affirming that all its miseries were let loose\r\nupon the human race by \"them greenins\" tempting our mother to curious\r\npomological speculations; and from that time till now--Longfellow, thou\r\nreasonest well!--\"things are not what they seem,\" but are diabolically\r\notherwise,--masked-batteries, nets, gins, and snares of evil.\r\n\r\n(In this connection I am reminded of--can I ever cease to remember?--the\r\nunlucky lecturer at our lyceum a few winters ago, who, on rising to\r\naddress his audience, applauding him all the while most vehemently,\r\npulled out his handkerchief, for oratorical purposes only, and\r\ninadvertently flung from his pocket three \"Baldwins\" that a friend had\r\ngiven to him on his way to the hall, straight into the front row of\r\ngiggling girls.)\r\n\r\nMy zeal on this subject received new impetus recently from an\r\nexclamation which pierced the thin partitions of the country-parsonage,\r\nonce my home, where I chanced to be a guest.\r\n\r\nFrom the adjoining dressing-room issued a prolonged \"Y-ah!\"--not the\r\nhowl of a spoiled child, nor the protest of a captive gorilla, but the\r\nwhole-souled utterance of a mighty son of Anak, whose amiability is\r\ninvulnerable to weapons of human aggravation.\r\n\r\nI paused in the midst of toilet-exigencies, and listened\r\nsympathetically, for I recognized the probable presence of the old enemy\r\nto whom the bravest and sweetest succumb.\r\n\r\nConfirmation and explanation followed speedily in the half apologetic,\r\nwholly wrathful declaration,--\"The pitcher was made foolish in the first\r\nplace.\" I dare affirm, that, if the spirit of Lindley Murray himself\r\nwere at that moment hovering over that scene of trial, he dropped a\r\ntear, or, better still, an adverbial _ly_ upon the false grammar, and\r\nblotted it out forever.\r\n\r\nI comprehended the scene at once. I had been there. I felt again the\r\nremorseless swash of the water over neat boots and immaculate hose; I\r\nsaw the perverse intricacies of its meanderings over the carpet, upon\r\nwhich the \"foolish\" pitcher had been confidingly deposited; I knew,\r\nbeyond the necessity of ocular demonstration, that, as sure as there\r\nwere \"pipe-hole\" or crack in the ceiling of the study below, those\r\ninanimate things would inevitably put their evil heads together, and\r\nbring to grief the long-suffering Dominie, with whom, during my day,\r\nsuch inundations had been of at least bi-weekly occurrence, instigated\r\nby crinoline. The inherent wickedness of that \"thing of beauty\" will be\r\nacknowledged by all mankind, and by every female not reduced to the\r\ndeplorable poverty of the heroine of the following veracious anecdote.\r\n\r\nA certain good bishop, on making a tour of inspection through a\r\nmission-school of his diocese, was so impressed by the aspect of all its\r\nbeneficiaries that his heart overflowed with joy, and he exclaimed to a\r\nlittle maiden whose appearance was particularly suggestive of\r\ncreature-comforts,--\"Why, my little girl! you have everything that heart\r\ncan wish, haven't you?\" Imagine the bewilderment and horror of the\r\nprelate, when the miniature Flora McFlimsey drew down the corners of her\r\nmouth lugubriously, and sought to accommodate the puffs and dimples of\r\nher fat little body to an expression of abject misery, as she\r\nreplied,--\"No, indeed, Sir! I haven't got any--skeleton!\"\r\n\r\nWe who have suffered know the disposition of graceless \"skeletons\" to\r\nhang themselves on \"foolish\" pitchers, bureau-knobs, rockers,\r\ncobble-stones, splinters, nails, and, indeed, any projection a tenth of\r\na line beyond a dead level.\r\n\r\nThe mention of nails is suggestive of voluminous distresses.\r\nCountry-parsonages, from some inexplicable reason, are wont to bristle\r\nall over with these impish assailants of human comfort.\r\n\r\nI never ventured to leave my masculine relatives to their own devices\r\nfor more than twenty-four consecutive hours, that I did not return to\r\nfind that they had seemingly manifested their grief at my absence after\r\nthe old Hebraic method, (\"more honored in the breach than the\r\nobservance,\") by rending their garments. When summoned to their account,\r\nthe invariable defence has been a vehement denunciation of some\r\nparticular _nail_ as the guilty cause of my woes.\r\n\r\nBy the way, O Christian woman of the nineteenth century, did it ever\r\nenter your heart to give devout thanks that you did not share the woe\r\nof those whose fate it was to \"sojourn in Mesech and dwell in the tents\r\nof Kedar\"? that it did not fall to your lot to do the plain sewing and\r\nmending for some Jewish patriarch, patriot, or prophet of yore?\r\n\r\nRealize, if you can, the masculine aggravation and the feminine\r\nlong-suffering of a period when the head of a family could neither go\r\ndown-town, nor even sit at his tent-door, without descrying some\r\nwickedness in high places, some insulting placard, some exasperating\r\nwar-bulletin, some offensive order from head-quarters, which caused him\r\nto transform himself instantly into an animated rag-bag. Whereas, in\r\nthese women-saving days, similar grievances send President Abraham into\r\nhis cabinet to issue a proclamation, the Reverend Jeremiah into his\r\npulpit with a scathing homily, Poet-Laureate David to the \"Atlantic\"\r\nwith a burning lyric, and Major-General Joab to the privacy of his tent,\r\nthere to calm his perturbed spirit with Drake's Plantation Bitters. In\r\nhumble imitation of another, I would state that this indorsement of the\r\npotency of a specific is entirely gratuitous, and that I am stimulated\r\nthereto by no remuneration, fluid or otherwise.\r\n\r\nBlessed be this day of sewing-machines for women, and of safety-valves\r\nand innocent explosives for their lords!\r\n\r\nBut this is a digression.\r\n\r\nI awoke very early in life to the consciousness that I held the doctrine\r\nwhich we are considering.\r\n\r\nOn a hapless day when I was perhaps five years old, I was, in my own\r\nestimation, intrusted with the family-dignity, when I was deposited for\r\nthe day at the house of a lordly Pharisee of the parish, with solemnly\r\nrepeated instructions in table-manners and the like.\r\n\r\nOne who never analyzed the mysteries of a sensitive child's heart cannot\r\nappreciate the sense of awful responsibility which oppressed me during\r\nthat visit. But all went faultlessly for a time. I corrected myself\r\ninstantly each time. I said, \"Yes, Ma'am,\" to Mr. Simon, and \"No, Sir,\"\r\nto Madam, which was as often as I addressed them; I clenched little\r\nfists and lips resolutely, that they might not touch, taste, handle,\r\ntempting _bijouterie_; I even held in check the spirit of inquiry\r\nrampant within me, and indulged myself with only one question to every\r\nthree minutes of time.\r\n\r\nAt last I found myself at the handsome dinner-table, triumphantly\r\nmounted upon two \"Comprehensive Commentaries\" and a dictionary, fearing\r\nno evil from the viands before me. Least of all did I suspect the\r\nvegetables of guile. But deep in the heart of a bland, mealy-mouthed\r\npotato lurked cruel designs upon my fair reputation.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had I, in the most approved style of nursery good-breeding,\r\napplied my fork to its surface, than the hardhearted thing executed a\r\nwild _pirouette_ before my astonished eyes, and then flew on impish\r\nwings across the room, dashing out its malicious brains, I am happy to\r\nsay, against the parlor-door, but leaving me in a half-comatose state,\r\nstirred only by vague longings for a lodge with \"proud Korah's troop,\"\r\nwhose destination is unmistakably set forth in the \"Shorter Catechism.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a possibility that I received my innate distrust of things by\r\ninheritance from my maternal grandmother, whose holy horror at the\r\nprofanity they once provoked from a bosom-friend in her childhood was\r\nstill vivid in her old age.\r\n\r\nIt was on this wise. When still a pretty Puritan maiden, my grandame was\r\ntempted irresistibly by the spring sunshine to the tabooed indulgence of\r\na Sunday-walk. The temptation was probably intensified by the\r\npresence of the British troops, giving unwonted fascination to\r\nvillage-promenades. Her confederate in this guilty pleasure was a\r\nlike-minded little saint; so there was a tacit agreement between them\r\nthat their transgression should be sanctified by a strict adherence to\r\nreligious topics of conversation. Accordingly they launched boldly upon\r\nthe great subject which was just then agitating church-circles in New\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nFortune smiled upon these criminals against the Blue Laws, until they\r\nencountered a wall surmounted by hickory rails. Without intermitting the\r\ndiscussion, Susannah sprang agilely up. Quoth she, balancing herself for\r\none moment upon the summit,--\"No, no, Betsey! _I_ believe God is the\r\nauthor of sin!\" The next she sprang toward the ground; but a salient\r\nsplinter, a chip of depravity, clutched her Sunday-gown, and converted\r\nher incontinently, it seems, into a confessor of the opposing faith; for\r\nhistory records, that, following the above-mentioned dogma, there came\r\nfrom hitherto unstained lips,--\"The Devil!\"\r\n\r\nTime and space would, of course, be inadequate to the enumeration of all\r\nthe demonstrations of the truth of the doctrine of the absolute\r\ndepravity of things. A few examples only can be cited.\r\n\r\nThere is melancholy pleasure in the knowledge that a great soul has gone\r\nmourning before me in the path I am now pursuing. It was only to-day,\r\nthat, in glancing over the pages of Victor Hugo's greatest work, I\r\nchanced upon the following:--\"Every one will have noticed with what\r\nskill a coin let fall upon the ground runs to hide itself, and what art\r\nit has in rendering itself invisible; there are thoughts which play us\r\nthe same trick,\" etc., etc.\r\n\r\nThe similar tendency of pins and needles is universally understood and\r\nexecrated,--their base secretiveness when searched for, and their\r\nincensing intrusion when one is off guard.\r\n\r\nI know a man whose sense of their malignity is so keen, that, whenever\r\nhe catches a gleam of their treacherous lustre on the carpet, he\r\ninstantly draws his two and a quarter yards of length into the smallest\r\npossible compass, and shrieks until the domestic police come to the\r\nrescue, and apprehend the sharp little villains. Do not laugh at this.\r\nYears ago he lost his choicest friend by the stab of just such a little\r\ndastard lying in ambush.\r\n\r\nSo also every wielder of the needle is familiar with the propensity of\r\nthe several parts of a garment in the process of manufacture to turn\r\nthemselves wrong side out, and down side up; and the same viciousness\r\ncleaves like leprosy to the completed garment so long as a thread\r\nremains.\r\n\r\nMy blood still tingles with a horrible memory illustrative of this\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nDressing hurriedly and in darkness for a concert one evening, I appealed\r\nto the Dominie, as we passed under the hall-lamp, for a\r\ntoilet-inspection.\r\n\r\n\"How do I look, father?\"\r\n\r\nAfter a sweeping glance came the candid statement,--\r\n\r\n\"Beau-tifully!\"\r\n\r\nOh, the blessed glamour which invests a child whose father views her\r\n\"with a critic's eye\"!\r\n\r\n\"Yes, _of course_; but look carefully, please; how is my dress?\"\r\n\r\nAnother examination of apparently severest scrutiny.\r\n\r\n\"All right, dear! That's the new cloak, is it? Never saw you look\r\nbetter. Come, we shall be late.\"\r\n\r\nConfidingly I went to the hall; confidingly I entered; since the\r\nconcert-room was crowded with rapt listeners to the Fifth Symphony, I,\r\ngingerly, but still confidingly, followed the author of my days, and the\r\ncritic of my toilet, to the very uppermost seat, which I entered, barely\r\nnodding to my finically fastidious friend, Guy Livingston, who was\r\nseated near us with a stylish-looking stranger, who bent eyebrows and\r\nglass upon me superciliously.\r\n\r\nSeated, the Dominie was at once lifted into the midst of the massive\r\nharmonies of the Adagio; I lingered outside a moment, in order to settle\r\nmy garments and--that woman's look. What! was that a partially\r\nsuppressed titter near me? Ah! she has no soul for music! How such\r\nill-timed merriment will jar upon my friend's exquisite sensibilities!\r\n\r\nShade of Beethoven! A hybrid cough and laugh, smothered decorously, but\r\nstill recognizable, from the courtly Guy himself! What can it mean?\r\n\r\nIn my perturbation, my eyes fell and rested upon the sack, whose newness\r\nand glorifying effect had been already noticed by my lynx-eyed parent.\r\n\r\nI here pause to remark that I had intended to request the compositor to\r\n\"set up\" the coming sentence in explosive capitals, by way of emphasis,\r\nbut forbear, realizing that it already staggers under the weight of its\r\nown significance.\r\n\r\nThat sack was wrong side out!\r\n\r\nStern necessity, proverbially known as \"the mother of invention,\" and\r\npractically the step-mother of ministers' daughters, had made me eke out\r\nthe silken facings of the front with cambric linings for the back and\r\nsleeves. Accordingly, in the full blaze of the concert-room, there sat\r\nI, \"accoutred as I was,\" in motley attire,--my homely little economies\r\npatent to admiring spectators: on either shoulder, budding wings\r\ncomposed of unequal parts of sarcenet-cambric and cotton-batting; and in\r\nmy heart--_parricide_ I had almost said, but it was rather the more\r\nfilial sentiment of desire to operate for cataract upon my father's\r\neyes. But a moment's reflection sufficed to transfer my indignation to\r\nits proper object,--the sinful sack itself, which, concerting with its\r\nkindred darkness, had planned this cruel assault upon my innocent pride.\r\n\r\nA constitutional obtuseness renders me delightfully insensible to one\r\nfruitful source of provocation among inanimate things. I am so dull as\r\nto regard all distinctions between \"rights\" and \"lefts\" as invidious;\r\nbut I have witnessed the agonized struggles of many a victim of\r\nfractious boots, and been thankful that \"I am not as other men are,\" in\r\nability to comprehend the difference between my right and left foot.\r\nStill, as already intimated, I have seen wise men driven mad by a thing\r\nof leather and waxed-ends.\r\n\r\nA little innocent of three years, in all the pride of his first boots,\r\nwas aggravated, by the perversity of the right to thrust itself on to\r\nthe left leg, to the utterance of a contraband expletive.\r\n\r\nWhen reproved by his horror-stricken mamma, he maintained a dogged\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nIn order to pierce his apparently indurated conscience, his censor\r\nfinally said, solemnly,--\r\n\r\n\"Dugald! God knows that you said that wicked word.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does He?\" cried the baby-victim of reral depravity, in a tone of\r\nrelief; \"then _He_ knows it was a doke\" (_Anglicè_, joke).\r\n\r\nBut, mind you, the sin-tempting boot intended no \"doke.\"\r\n\r\nThe toilet, with its multiform details and complicated machinery, is a\r\ndemon whose surname is Legion.\r\n\r\nTime would fail me to speak of the elusiveness of soap, the knottiness\r\nof strings, the transitory nature of buttons, the inclination of\r\nsuspenders to twist, and of hooks to forsake their lawful eyes, and\r\ncleave only unto the hairs of their hapless owner's head. (It occurs to\r\nme as barely possible, that, in the last case, the hooks may be\r\ninnocent, and the sinfulness may lie in _capillary_ attraction.)\r\n\r\nAnd, O my brother or sister in sorrow, has it never befallen you, when\r\nbending all your energies to the mighty task of \"doing\" your back-hair,\r\nto find yourself gazing inanely at the opaque back of your brush, while\r\nthe hand-mirror, which had maliciously insinuated itself into your right\r\nhand for this express purpose, came down upon your devoted head with a\r\nresonant whack?\r\n\r\nI have alluded, parenthetically, to the possible guilt of capillary\r\nattraction, but I am prepared to maintain against the attraction of\r\ngravitation the charge of total depravity. Indeed, I should say of it,\r\nas did the worthy exhorter of the Dominie's old parish in regard to\r\nslavery,--\"It's the wickedest thing in the world, except sin!\"\r\n\r\nIt was only the other day that I saw depicted upon the young divine's\r\ncountenance, from this cause, thoughts \"too deep for tears,\" and,\r\nperchance, too earthy for clerical utterance.\r\n\r\nFrom a mingling of sanitary and economic considerations, he had cleared\r\nhis own sidewalk after a heavy snow-storm. As he stood, leaning upon his\r\nshovel, surveying with smiling complacency his accomplished task, the\r\nspite of the arch-fiend Gravitation was raised against him, and, finding\r\nthe impish slates (hadn't Luther something to say about \"_as many devils\r\nas tiles_\"?) ready to coöperate, an avalanche was the result, making the\r\nlast state of that sidewalk worse than the first, and sending the divine\r\ninto the house with a battered hat, and an article of faith\r\nsupplementary to the orthodox thirty-nine.\r\n\r\nProlonged reflection upon a certain class of grievances has convinced me\r\nthat mankind has generally ascribed them to a guiltless source. I refer\r\nto the unspeakable aggravation of \"typographical errors,\" rightly so\r\ncalled,--for, in nine cases out of ten, I opine it is the types\r\nthemselves which err.\r\n\r\nI appeal to fellow-sufferers, if the substitutions and interpolations\r\nand false combinations of letters are not often altogether too absurd\r\nfor humanity.\r\n\r\nTake, as one instance, the experience of a friend, who, in writing in\r\nall innocency of a session of the Historical Society, affirmed mildly in\r\nmanuscript, \"All went smoothly,\" but weeks after was made to declare in\r\nblatant print, \"All went _snoringly_!\"\r\n\r\nAs among men, so in the alphabet, one sinner destroyeth much good.\r\n\r\nThe genial Senator from the Granite Hills told me of an early aspiration\r\nof his own for literary distinction, which was beheaded remorselessly by\r\na villain of this type. By way of majestic peroration to a pathetic\r\narticle, he had exclaimed, \"For what would we exchange the fame of\r\nWashington?\"--referring, I scarcely need say, to the man of fragrant\r\nmemory, and not to the odorous capital. The black-hearted little dies,\r\nleft to their own devices one night, struck dismay to the heart of the\r\naspirant author by propounding in black and white a prosaic inquiry as\r\nto what would be considered a fair equivalent for the _farm_ of the\r\nfather of his country!\r\n\r\nAmong frequent instances of this depravity in my own experience, a\r\nflagrant example still shows its ugly front on a page of a child's book.\r\nIn the latest edition of \"Our Little Girls,\" (good Mr. Randolph, pray\r\nread, mark, learn, and inwardly digest,) there occurs a description of a\r\nchristening, wherein a venerable divine is made to dip \"his _head_\" into\r\nthe consecrating water, and lay it upon the child.\r\n\r\nDisembodied words are also sinners and the occasions of sin. Who has not\r\nbroken the Commandments in consequence of the provocation of some\r\nmiserable little monosyllabic eluding his grasp in the moment of his\r\ndirest need, or of some impertinent interloper thrusting itself in to\r\nthe utter demoralization of his well-organized sentences? Who has not\r\nbeen covered with shame at tripping over the pronunciation of some\r\nperfectly simple word like \"statistics,\" \"inalienable,\" \"inextricable,\"\r\netc., etc., etc.?\r\n\r\nWhose experience will not empower him to sympathize with that\r\nunfortunate invalid, who, on being interrogated by a pious visitor in\r\nregard to her enjoyment of means of grace, informed the horror-stricken\r\ninquisitor,--\"I have not been to church for years, I have been such an\r\n_infidel_,\"--and then, moved by a dim impression of wrong somewhere, as\r\nwell as by the evident shock inflicted upon her worthy visitor, but\r\nconscious of her own integrity, repeated still more emphatically,--\"No;\r\nI have been a confirmed infidel for years.\"\r\n\r\nBut a peremptory summons from an animated nursery forbids my lingering\r\nlonger in this fruitful field. I can only add an instance of\r\ncorroborating testimony from each member of the circle originating this\r\nessay.\r\n\r\nThe Dominie _loq._--\"Sha'n't have anything to do with it! It's a wicked\r\nthing! To be sure, I do remember, when I was a little boy, I used to\r\nthrow stones at the chip-basket when it upset the cargo I had just\r\nladed, and it was a great relief to my feelings too. Besides, you've\r\ntold stories about me which were anything but true. I don't remember\r\nanything about that sack.\"\r\n\r\nLady-visitor _loq._--\"The first time I was invited to Mr. ----'s, (the\r\nHon. ---- ----'s, you know,) I was somewhat anxious, but went home\r\nflattering myself I had made a creditable impression. Imagine my\r\nconsternation, when I came to relieve the pocket of my gala-gown, donned\r\nfor the occasion, at discovering among its treasures a tea-napkin,\r\nmarked gorgeously with the Hon. ---- ----'s family-crest, which had\r\nmaliciously crept into its depths in order to bring me into disgrace! I\r\nhave never been able to bring myself to the point of confession, in\r\nspite of my subsequent intimacy with the family. If it were not for\r\nJoseph's positive assertion to the contrary, I should be of the opinion\r\nthat his cup of divination conjured itself deliberately and sinfully\r\ninto innocent Benjamin's sack.\"\r\n\r\nStudent _loq._ (Testimony open to criticism.)--\"Met pretty girl on the\r\nstreet yesterday. Sure I had on my 'Armstrong' hat when I left\r\nhome,--sure as fate; but when I went to pull it off,--by the crown, of\r\ncourse,--to bow to pretty girl, I smashed in my beaver! How it got there\r\ndon't know. Knocked it off. Pretty girl picked it up and handed it to\r\nme. Confounded things, any way!\"\r\n\r\nYoung divine _loq._--\"While I was in the army, I was in Washington on\r\n'leave' for two or three days. One night, at a party, I became utterly\r\nbewildered in an attempt to converse, after long desuetude, with a\r\nfascinating woman. I went stumbling on, amazing her more and more, until\r\nfinally I covered myself with glory by the categorical statement that in\r\nmy opinion General McClellan could 'never get across the Peninsula\r\nwithout a _fattle_; I beg pardon, Madam! what I mean to say is, without\r\na _bight_.'\"\r\n\r\nSchool-girl _loq._--\"When Uncle ---- was President, I was at the White\r\nHouse at a state-dinner one evening. Senator ---- came rushing in\r\nfrantically after we had been at table some time. No sooner was he\r\nseated than he turned to Aunt to apologize for his delay; and, being\r\nvery much heated, and very much embarrassed, he tugged away desperately\r\nat his pocket, and finally succeeded in extracting a huge blue stocking,\r\nevidently of home-manufacture, with which he proceeded to wipe his\r\nforehead very energetically and very conspicuously. I suppose the truth\r\nwas that the poor man's handkerchiefs were \"on a strike,\" and thrust\r\nforward this homespun stocking to bring him to terms.\"\r\n\r\nSchool-girl, No. 2, _loq._--\"My last term at F., I was expecting a box\r\nof 'goodies' from home. So when the message came, 'An express-package\r\nfor you, Miss Fanny!' I invited all my specials to come and assist at\r\nthe opening. Instead of the expected box, there appeared a\r\nmisshapen-bundle, done up in yellow wrapping-paper. Four such\r\ndejected-looking damsels were never seen before as we, standing around\r\nthe ugly old thing. Finally, Alice suggested,--\r\n\r\n\"'Open it!'\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, I know what it is,' I said; 'it is my old Thibet, that mother has\r\nhad made over for me.'\r\n\r\n\"'Let's see,' persisted Alice.\r\n\r\n\"So I opened the package. The first thing I drew out was too much for\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\"'What a funny-looking basque!' exclaimed Alice. All the rest were\r\nstruck dumb with disappointment.\r\n\r\n\"No! not a basque at all, but a man's black satin waistcoat! and next\r\ncame objects about which there could be no doubt,--a pair of dingy old\r\ntrousers, and a swallow-tailed coat! Imagine the chorus of damsels!\r\n\r\n\"The secret was, that two packages lay in father's office,--one for me,\r\nthe other for those everlasting freedmen. John was to forward mine. He\r\nhad taken up the box to write my address on it, when the yellow bundle\r\ntumbled off the desk at his feet and scared the wits out of his head.\r\nSo I came in for father's secondhand clothes, and the Ethiopians had the\r\n'goodies'!\"\r\n\r\nRepentant Dominie _loq._--\"I don't approve of it at all; but then, if\r\nyou must write the wicked thing, I heard a good story for you to-day.\r\nDr. ---- found himself in the pulpit of a Dutch Reformed Church the other\r\nSunday. You know he is one who prides himself on his adaptation to\r\nplaces and times. Just at the close of the introductory services, a\r\nblack gown lying over the arm of the sofa caught his eye. He was rising\r\nto deliver his sermon, when it forced itself on his attention again.\r\n\r\n\"'Sure enough,' thought he, 'Dutch Reformed clergymen do wear gowns. I\r\nmight as well put it on.'\r\n\r\n\"So he solemnly thrust himself into the malicious (as you would say)\r\ngarment, and went through the services as well as he could, considering\r\nthat his audience seemed singularly agitated, and indeed on the point of\r\nbursting out into a general laugh, throughout the entire service. And no\r\nwonder! The good Doctor, in his zeal for conformity, had attired himself\r\nin the black cambric duster in which the pulpit was shrouded during\r\nweek-days, and had been gesticulating his eloquent homily with his arms\r\nthrust through the holes left for the pulpit-lamps!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT SHALL WE HAVE FOR DINNER?\r\n\r\n\r\nI think I must be personally known to most of the readers of the\r\n\"Atlantic.\" I see them wherever I go, and they see me. Beneath a\r\nshelter-tent by the Rapidan, in a striped railroad-station in Bavaria,\r\nat the counter of Trübner's bookstore in London, and at Cordaville, in\r\nWorcester County, Massachusetts, as we waited for the freight to get out\r\nof the way, I have read the \"Atlantic\" over their shoulders, or they\r\nover mine. The same thing has happened at six hundred and thirty-two\r\nother improbable places. More than this, however, my words and works in\r\nthe great science of Domestic Economy have travelled everywhere before\r\nme, not simply like the Connecticut of the poet,\r\n\r\n    \"Bringing shad to South Hadley, and pleasure to man,\"[35]\r\n\r\nbut extending all over the civilized world. Not that I am the author of\r\nthe clothes-wringing machine, or of the spring clothes-pin,--my\r\ninfluence has been more subtile. I have propounded great central axioms\r\nin housekeeping and the other economies, which have rushed over the\r\nworld with the inevitable momentum of truth. It was I, for instance, who\r\nfirst discovered and proclaimed the great governing fact that the butter\r\nof a family costs more than its bread. It was I who first announced that\r\nyou cannot economize in the quality of your paper. I am the discoverer\r\nof the formula that a family consumes as many barrels of flour in a year\r\nas it has adult members, reducing children to adults by the rule of\r\nthree. The morning after our marriage I raised the window-shade, so that\r\nthe rising sun of that auspicious day should shine full upon our\r\nparlor-Brussels. I said to Lois, \"Let us never be slaves to our\r\ncarpets!\" The angel smiled assent; and on the wings of that smile my\r\nwhisper fluttered over the earth. It brooded in a thousand homes else\r\nmiserable. Light was where before was chaos. Sunshine drove scrofula\r\nfrom ten thousand quivering frames, and millions of infant lips would\r\nthis day raise Lois's name and mine in their Kindergarten songs, did\r\nthey only know who were their benefactors.\r\n\r\nStanding thus in the centre of the sphere of the domestic economies, I\r\nhave, of course, read with passionate interest the \"House and Home\r\nPapers\" in the \"Atlantic.\" It is I, as I am proud to confess, who have,\r\nviolated all copyright, have had them reprinted, as Tract No. 2237 of\r\nthe American Tract Society, No. 63 of the American Tract Society of\r\nBoston, and No. 445 of the issues of the Sanitary Commission, and am now\r\nabout to introduce them surreptitiously into the bureaus of these\r\ncharities, so that the colporteurs, of every stripe, may at last be\r\ncertain that they are conferring the first of benefits upon their\r\nhomeless fellow-creatures. It is I who every night toil through long\r\nstreets that I may slide these little tracts, messengers of blessing,\r\nunder the front-doors of wretched friends, who are dying without homes\r\nin the gilded miseries of their bowling-alley parlors. Where they have\r\nintroduced the patent weather-strip, I place the tract on the upper\r\ndoor-step, with a brick-bat, which keeps it from blowing away. But I\r\nobserve that it is no part of the plan of those charming papers, more\r\nthan it was of the \"Novum Organon\" or of the \"Principia,\" to descend\r\ninto the details of the economies. I suppose that the author left all\r\nthat to the \"Domestic Economy\" of her excellent sister, and, as far as\r\nthe details of practice go, well she might. But between that practical\r\ndetail by which one sister cooks to-day the dinners on a million tables,\r\nand the æsthetic, moral, and religious considerations by which the other\r\nsister elevates the life of the million homes in whose dining-rooms\r\nthose tables stand, there is room for a brief exposition of the\r\nprinciples on which those dinners are to be selected.\r\n\r\nIt is that exposition which, as I sit superior, I am to give, _ex\r\ncathedra_, after this long preface, now.\r\n\r\nI shall illustrate the necessity of this exposition by an introduction\r\nto follow the preface, after the manner of the Germans, before we arrive\r\nat the substance of our work, which will be itself comprised in its\r\nfirst chapter. This introduction will consist of two illustrations. The\r\nfirst relates to the planting of potatoes. When I inherited my ancestral\r\nestate, known as \"Crusoe's Well,\" I resolved to devote it to potatoes\r\nfor the first summer. I summoned my vassals, and we fenced it. I bought\r\ndung and manured it. I hired ploughmen and oxen, and they ploughed it. I\r\nmade a covenant with a Kelt, who became, _quoad hoc_, my slave, and gave\r\nto him money, with which I directed him to buy seed-potatoes and plant\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAnd he,--\"How many shall I buy?\"\r\n\r\nI retired to my study, consulted London, Lindley, and Linnæus,--the\r\nthick Gray, the middling Gray, and the child's Gray,--Worcester's\r\nDictionary, and Webster's, in both of which you can usually find almost\r\nanything but what should be there,--Johnson's \"Dictionary of Gardening,\"\r\nand Gardner's \"Dictionary of Farming,\"--and none of these treatises\r\nmentioned the quantity of potatoes proper for planting a given space of\r\nland. Even the Worcester and Webster failed. I was reduced to tell the\r\nKelt to ask the huckster of whom he bought. All the treatises went on\r\nthe principle--true, but inadequate--that \"any fool would know.\" Any\r\nfool might, probably does,--but I was not a fool.\r\n\r\nThe next year, having built my house and taken Lois home, the bluebirds\r\nsang spring to us one fine morning, and we went out to plant our\r\nradish-seeds. With fit forethought, the seed had been bought, the ground\r\nmanured and raked, the string, the dibble, the woman's trowel, the man's\r\ntrowel, the sticks for the seed-papers, and the papers were all there.\r\nLois was charming, in her sun-bonnet; I looked knowing in my Canadian\r\noat-straw. We marked out the bed,--as the robins, meadow-larks, and\r\nbluebirds directed. Lois then looked up article \"Radish\" in the\r\n\"Farmer's Dictionary,\" and we found the lists of \"Long White Naples,\"\r\n\"White Spanish,\" \"Black Spanish,\" \"Long Scarlet,\" \"White Turnip-Root,\"\r\n\"Purple Turnip,\" and the rest, for two columns, which we should and\r\nshould not plant. All that was nothing to us. We were to plant\r\nradish-seeds, which we had bought, as such, from Mr. Swett. How deep to\r\nplant them, how far apart or how near together, the book was to tell.\r\nBut the book only said, \"Everybody knows how to plant radishes.\"\r\n\r\nNow this was not true. _We_ did not know.\r\n\r\nThese two illustrations, as the minister says, are sufficient to show\r\nthe character of the deficiency which I am now to supply,--which young\r\nhousekeepers of intelligence feel, when they have got their nests ready\r\nand begin to bill and coo in-doors. There are many things which every\r\nfool knows, which people of sense do not know. First among these things\r\nis, \"What will you have for dinner?\"--a question not to be answered by\r\ndetailed answers,--on the principle of the imaginary Barmacide feasts of\r\nthe cook-books,--but by the results of deep principles, which underlie,\r\nindeed, the whole superficial strata of civilized life. Did not the army\r\nof the Punjaub perish, as it retreated from Ghizni to Jelalabad, not\r\nbecause the enemy's lances were strong, but because one day it did not\r\ndine?\r\n\r\nI am not going to tell the old story of that \"sweet pretty girl\" who,\r\nafter a week of legs of mutton, ordered a \"leg of beef.\" I sympathize\r\nwith her from the bottom of my heart. Her sister will be married\r\nto-morrow. To her I dedicate this paper, that she may know, not what she\r\nshall order,--that is left to her own sweet will, less fettered now that\r\nher life is rounded by her welding it upon its other half than it was\r\nwhen she wandered in maiden meditation fancy-free,--not, I say, what she\r\nshall order for her dinner and for Leander's, but the principle on which\r\nthe order is to be given.\r\n\r\n\"But, my dear Mr. Carter,\" says the blushing child, as she reads, \"we\r\nhave got to be so dreadfully economical!\"\r\n\r\nFairest of your sex, there was never one of your sex, since Eve finished\r\nthe apple, lest any should be wasted, nor of my sex, since Adam grimly\r\nchamped the parings, thinking he was \"in for it,\" who should not be\r\neconomical. A just economy is the law of a luxurious life. \"Dreadful\r\neconomy\" is the principle which is now to be unfolded to you.\r\n\r\nEconomy in itself is one of the most agreeable of luxuries. This I need\r\nnot demonstrate. Everybody knows what good fun it is to make a bargain.\r\nEconomy becomes dreadful, only when some lightning-flash of truth shows\r\nus that our painful frugality has been really the most lavish waste.\r\n\r\nSo Lois and I, for nine years, lived without a corkscrew. We would buy\r\nbusts and chromoliths with our money instead,--we would go to the White\r\nMountains, we would maintain an elegant æsthetic hospitality, as they do\r\nin Paris, with the money we should save by doing without a corkscrew. So\r\nI spoiled two sets of kitchen-forks by drawing corks with them, I broke\r\nthe necks of legions of bottles for which Mr. Tarr would have credited\r\nme two cents each, and many times damaged, even to the swearing-point,\r\none of the sweetest tempers in the world,--all that we might economize\r\non this corkscrew. But one day, at the corner-shop, I saw a corkscrew in\r\nthe glass show-case, lying on some pocket-combs and family dye-stuffs. I\r\nasked the price, to learn that it cost seventeen cents. The resolution\r\nof years gave way before the temptation. I bought the corkscrew, and\r\nfrom that moment my income has equalled my expenses. So you see, my\r\nsweet May-bud, just trembling on the edge of housekeeping, that true\r\neconomy consists in buying the right thing at the right time,--if you\r\nonly pay for it as you go.\r\n\r\n\"But, my dear Mr. Carter, I don't know what the right thing is!\"\r\n\r\nSweet heart, I knew it. And your husband knows no more than you\r\ndo,--although he will pretend to know, that he may look cross when the\r\nbills come in. Read what follows; hide the \"Atlantic\" before he comes\r\nhome; and you will know more than he knows on the most important point\r\nin human life. Vainly, henceforth, will he quote Greek to you, or talk\r\npompous nonsense about the price of Treasury certificates, if you know\r\nat what price eggs are really cheap, and at what price they are really\r\ndear.\r\n\r\nListen, and remember! Then hide the \"Atlantic\" away.\r\n\r\nWhen I engaged in the study of Hebrew, which was at that time a\r\n\"regular\" at college, (for why should I blush to own that I am in my one\r\nhundred and tenth year?) as I toiled through the rules and exceptions in\r\ndear old Stephen Sewall's Hebrew Grammar, I ventured to ask him, one\r\ndesperately hot June day, whether he could not tell us, were it only for\r\ncuriosity's sake, which rule would come into play in every verse, and\r\nwhich would be of use only once or twice in the whole Bible. \"Ah,\r\nCarter,\" said the dear old fellow, (he taught his beloved language with\r\nhis own book,) \"it is all of use,--all!\" And so we had to take it all,\r\nand find out as we could which rules would be constant servitors to us,\r\nand which occasional lackeys, hired for special occasions. Just so, dear\r\nHero, do you stand about your housekeeping. You wall be fretting\r\nyourself to death to economize in each one of one hundred and seven\r\ndifferent articles,--for so many are you and Leander to assimilate and\r\nmake your own special phosphate and carbon, as this sweet honey-year of\r\nyours goes on. Of that fret and wear of your sweet temper, child, there\r\nis no use at all. Listen, and you shall learn what are to be the great\r\nconstants of your expense,--what Stephen Sewall would have called the\r\nregular verbs transitive of your being, doing, and suffering,--and how\r\nmany of the one hundred and seven are only exceptional Lamed Hhes, at\r\nwhich you can guess or which you can skip, if the great central\r\nmovements of your economies go bravely on.\r\n\r\nI do not know, of course, whether Leander is fond of coffee, and whether\r\nyou drink tea or no. I can only tell you what is in our family, and\r\nassure you that ours is a model family. Such a model is it, that Lois\r\nhas just now counted up the one hundred and seven articles for me,--has\r\nshown me that they all together cost us nine hundred and twenty-six\r\ndollars and thirty-two cents in the year 1863, and how much each of them\r\ncost. Now our family consists,--\r\n\r\n1. Of the baby, who is king.\r\n\r\n2, 3. Of two nurses, who are prime-ministers, one of domestic affairs,\r\none of private education.\r\n\r\n4, 5. Of a cook and table-girl, who are chancellor and foreign\r\nsecretary. These four make the cabinet.\r\n\r\n6-8. Three older children; these are in the government, but not in the\r\ncabinet.\r\n\r\n9 and 10. Lois and I,--who pay the taxes, fight common enemies, and do\r\nwhat the others tell us as well as we can.\r\n\r\nThis family, you observe, consists of six grown persons, and three\r\nchildren old enough to eat, who are equivalent to a seventh. I may say,\r\nin passing, that it therefore consumes just seven barrels of flour a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nTo feed it, as Lois has just now shown you, cost in the year 1863 nine\r\nhundred and twenty-six dollars and thirty-two cents. That is the way we\r\nchose to live. We could have lived just as happily on half that sum,--we\r\ncould have lived just as wretchedly on ten times that sum. But, however\r\nwe lived, the proportions of our expense would not have varied much from\r\nwhat I am now to teach you, dear Hero (if that really be your name).\r\n\r\nBUTTER is the biggest expense-item of all. Of our nine hundred and\r\ntwenty-six dollars and thirty-two cents, ninety-one dollars and\r\ntwenty-six cents went for butter. Remember that your butter is one-tenth\r\npart of the whole.\r\n\r\nNext comes flour. Our seven barrels cost us seventy dollars and\r\neighty-three cents. We bought, besides, six dollars and seventy-six\r\ncents' worth of bread, and six dollars and seventy-one cents' worth of\r\ncrackers,--convenient sometimes, dear Hero. So that your wheat-flour and\r\nbread are almost a tenth of the whole.\r\n\r\nNext comes beef, in all forms, ninety dollars and seventy-six cents;\r\nthere goes another tenth. The other meats are, mutton, forty-seven\r\ndollars and sixty-seven cents; turkeys, chickens, etc., if you call them\r\nmeat, sixty-one dollars and fifty-six cents; lamb, seventeen dollars and\r\nfifty-three cents; veal, eleven dollars and fifty-three cents; fresh\r\npork, one dollar and seventy-three cents. (This must have been for some\r\nguest. Lois and I each had a grandfather named Enoch, and have Jewish\r\nprejudices; also, fresh pork is really the most costly article of diet,\r\nif you count in the doctor's bills. But for ham there is ten dollars and\r\ntwenty-two cents. Ham is always available, you know, Hero. For other\r\nsalt pork, I recommend you to institute a father or brother, or cousin\r\nattached to you in youth, who shall carry on a model farm in the\r\ncountry, and kill for you a model corn-fed pig every year, see it salted\r\nwith his own eyes, and send to you a half-barrel of the pork for a _gage\r\nd'amour_. It is a much more sentimental present than rosebuds, dearest\r\nHero,--and it lasts longer. That is the way we do; and salt pork,\r\ntherefore, does not appear on our bills. But against such salt pork I\r\nhave no Hebrew prejudice. Try it, Hero, with paper-sliced potatoes fried\r\nfor breakfast.) All other forms of meat sum up only two dollars and\r\ntwenty-three cents. And now, Hero, I will explain to you the philosophy\r\nof meats. You see they cost you a quarter part of what you spend.\r\n\r\nKnow, then, my dear child, that the real business of the three meals a\r\nday,--of the neat luncheon you serve on your wedding-silver for Mrs.\r\nDubbadoe and her pretty daughter, when they drive in from Milton to see\r\nyou,--of the ice-cream you ate last night at the summer party which the\r\nBellinghams gave the Pinckneys,--of the hard-tack and boiled dog which\r\ndear John is now digesting in front of Petersburg,--the real business, I\r\nsay, is to supply the human frame with carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and\r\nnitrogen in organized forms. It must be in organized matter. You might\r\npound your wedding-diamonds for carbon, you might give water from Jordan\r\nfor oxygen and hydrogen, and the snow-flakes of the Jungfrau might serve\r\nthe nitrogen for Leander's dinners, but, because these are not\r\norganized, Leander's cheek would pale, and his teeth shake in their\r\nsockets, and his muscles dwindle to packthreads, as William Augustus's\r\ndo in the Slovenly-Peter books, and he would die before your eyes, Hero!\r\nYes, he would die! Do not, in your love of him, therefore, feed him on\r\nyour diamonds. Give him organized matter. Now, in doing this, you have\r\nbeen wise in spending even a tenth of your substance on wheat. For wheat\r\nis almost pure food; and wheat contains all you want,--more carbon than\r\nyour diamonds, more oxygen and hydrogen than your tears, more nitrogen\r\nthan the snow-flake,--but not nitrogen enough, dear Hero.\r\n\r\n\"More nitrogen!\" gasps Leander, \"more nitrogen, my charmer, or I die!\"\r\nThis is the real meaning of the words, when he says, \"Let us have\r\nroast-beef for dinner,\" or when he asks you to pass him the butter.\r\n\r\nAlthough beef, then, has little more than a quarter as much food in it\r\nas wheat has, you must have some beef, or something like it, because\r\nLeander, and you too, my rosy-cheek, must have nitrogen as well as\r\ncarbon.\r\n\r\nI beg you not to throw the \"Atlantic\" away at this point, my child. Do\r\nnot say that Mr. Carter is an old fool, and that you never meant to live\r\non vegetables. A great many people have meant to, and have never known\r\nwhat was the matter with them, when the real deficiency was nitrogen.\r\nBesides, child, though wheat is the best single feeder of all, as I have\r\ntold you, because in its gluten it has so much nitrogen, this is to be\r\nsaid of all vegetables, that, so far as we live on them, we exist\r\nslowly; to a certain extent we have to ruminate as the cows do, and not\r\nas men and women should ruminate, and all animal or functional life goes\r\nmore slowly on. Now, Hero, you and Leander both have to lead a rapid\r\nlife. Most people do in the autumn of 1864. So give him meat, dear Hero,\r\nas above.\r\n\r\nAs for my being an old fool, my dear, I have said I am one hundred and\r\nnine, which is older than old Mr. Waldo was, older than everybody except\r\nold Parr. And after forty, everybody is a fool--or a physician.\r\n\r\nLet us return, then, to our mutton,--always a good thing to return to,\r\nespecially if the plates are hot, as yours, Hero, always will be. For\r\nmutton, besides such water as you can dry out of it, contains\r\ntwenty-nine per cent. of food,--for meat, a high percentage.\r\n\r\nLet us see where we are.\r\n\r\nOur butter costs us one-tenth.\r\n\r\nOur flour and wheat-bread cost us almost one-tenth.\r\n\r\nOur beef costs us one-tenth.\r\n\r\nOur other meats cost us a tenth and a half of what we spend for eating\r\nand drinking.\r\n\r\n\"Where in the world does the rest go, Mr. Carter? Here is not half. But\r\nI could certainly live very well on these things.\"\r\n\r\nAngel, you could. But if you lived wholly on these, you would want more\r\nof them. You see we have said nothing of coffee and tea,--the princes or\r\nprincesses of food,--without which civilized man cannot renew his\r\nbrains. In such years as these, Hero, when our brave soldiers must have\r\ncoffee or we can have no victories, coffee costs me and Lois fifty\r\ndollars,--cheap at that,--for, without it, did we drink dandelion like\r\nthe cows, or chiccory like the asses, how were these brains renewed?\r\n\r\n\"Tea and coffee are the same thing,\" says Liebig; at least, he says that\r\n_Theine_, the base of tea, and _Caffeine_, the base of coffee, are the\r\nsame. What I know is, that, when coffee costs fifty dollars a year, tea\r\ncosts thirty dollars and eighty-nine cents.\r\n\r\nFor tea and coffee, Hero, allow about another tenth,--the cocoa and\r\ncream will bring it up to that.\r\n\r\nOur sugar cost us fifty-four dollars and twenty-two cents; our milk\r\nfifty dollars and sixty-two; our cream ten dollars seventy-seven.\r\n\r\n\"Buy your cream separate,\" says Hero, \"if you have as good a milkman as\r\nMr. Whittemore.\"\r\n\r\nYou have not as many babies as we, Hero. When you have, you will not\r\ngrudge the milk or the sugar. Lots of nourishment in sugar! Sugar and\r\nmilk are another tenth.\r\n\r\nI do not know if you are a Catholic, Hero; but I guess your kitchen is;\r\nand so I am pretty sure that you will eat fish Fridays. I know you are a\r\nperson of sense, so I know you will often delight Leander, as he rises\r\nfrom the day's swim which, for your sake, Hero, he takes across the cold\r\nHellespont of life,--(all men are Leanders, and all women should be\r\ntheir Heros, holding high love-torches for them,)--as he rises, I say,\r\nwith \"a sound of wateriness,\" I know you will often delight him with\r\noysters, scalloped, fried, or plain, as _entremets_ to flank his\r\ndinner-table. For fish count two per cent., for oysters two more, for\r\neggs three or four, and for that stupid compound of starch which some\r\nmen call \"indispensable,\" and all men call \"potato,\" count three or four\r\nmore. My advice is, that, when potatoes are dear, you skip them.\r\nRice-_croquets_ are better and cheaper. There goes another tenth.\r\n\r\nTea and coffee, etc., one-tenth.\r\n\r\nSugar and milk, one-tenth.\r\n\r\nFish, eggs, potatoes, etc., one-tenth.\r\n\r\nThus is it, Hero, that three-quarters of what you eat will be spent for\r\nyour bread and butter, your meat, fish, eggs, and potatoes, your coffee,\r\ntea, milk, and sugar,--for twenty-one articles on a list of one hundred\r\nand seven. Fresh vegetables, besides those named, will take one-fifth of\r\nwhat is left: say five per cent. of the whole expense. The doctor will\r\norder porter or wine, when your back aches, or when Leander looks thin.\r\nHave nothing to do with them till he does order them, but reserve\r\nanother five per cent. for them. The rest, Hero, it is mace, it is\r\nyeast, it is vinegar, pepper, and mustard, it is sardines, it is\r\nlobster, it is the unconsidered world of trifles which make up the\r\nvisible difference between the table of high civilization and that of\r\nthe Abyssinian or the Blackfoot Indian. Let us hope it is not much\r\ncream-of-tartar or saleratus. It is grits and grapes, it is lard and\r\nlemons, it is maple-sugar and melons, it is nuts and nutmeg, or any\r\nother alliteration that you fancy.\r\n\r\nNow, pretty one, I can see you smile, and I can hear you say,--\"Dear old\r\nMr. Carter, I am very much obliged to you. I begin to see my way a\r\nlittle more clearly.\" Of course you do, child. You begin to see that the\r\nmost desperate economy in lemons will not make you and Leander rich, but\r\nthat you must make up your mind at the start about beef and about\r\nbutter. Hear, then, my parting whisper.\r\n\r\nDisregard the traditions of economy. What is cheap to-day is dear\r\nto-morrow. Do not make a bill-of-fare, and, because everything on it\r\ntastes very badly, think it is cheap. Salt codfish is cheap sometimes,\r\nand sometimes very dear. Venison is often an extravagance; but, of a\r\nwinter when the sleighing is good, and when the hunters have not gone\r\nSouth, it is the cheapest food for you. Eggs are dear, if they tempt you\r\nto cakes that you do not like. But no eggs can be sent to our brave\r\narmy, so, if you do choose to make a bargain with your Aunt Eunice at\r\nNaugatuck Neck to send you four dozen by express once a week, they will\r\nbe, perhaps, the cheapest food you can buy. What you want, my child, is\r\nvariety. However cheaply you live, secure four things: First, a change\r\nof fare from day to day, so as to have a good appetite; Second,\r\nsimplicity, each day, in the table, so as to lose but little in chips;\r\nThird, fitness of things there, as hot plates for your mutton and cold\r\nones for your butter, so that what you have may be of the best; and,\r\nfirst, second, third, and last, love between you and Leander. This last\r\nsauce, says Solomon, answers even for herbs. And you know the Emperors\r\nAugustus and Nebuchadnezzar both had to live on herbs,--I am afraid,\r\nbecause love had been wanting in both cases. If you have a stalled ox,\r\nyou will need the same sauces,--much more, unless it is better dressed\r\nthan the only one I ever saw, which was at Warwick, when Cheron and I\r\nwere going to Stratford-on-Avon. It was not attractive. You will need\r\nthree of these four things, if you are rich. Rich or poor, buy in as\r\nlarge quantities as you can. Rich or poor, pay cash. Rich or poor, do\r\nnot try to do without carbon or nitrogen. Rich or poor, vary steadily\r\nthe bills-of-fare. Now the minimum of what you can support life upon, at\r\nthis moment, is easily told. Jeff Davis makes the calculation for you.\r\nIt is quarter of a pound of salt pork a day, with four Graham hard-tack.\r\nThat is what each of his soldiers is eating; and though they are not\r\nstout, they are wiry fellows, and fight well. The maximum you can find\r\nby lodging at the Brevoort, at New York,--where, when I last went to the\r\nfront, I stopped an hour on the way, and, though I had no meals, paid\r\ntwo dollars and eighty cents for washing my face in another man's\r\nbedroom. A year of Jeff Davis's diet would cost you and Leander, if you\r\nbought in large quantities, sixty dollars. A year at Rye Beach just now\r\nwould cost you two or three thousand dollars. Choose your dinner from\r\neither bill; vary it, by all the gradations between. But remember,\r\nchild, as you would cheer Leander after his swim, and keep within your\r\nallowance, remember that what was dear yesterday may be cheap\r\nto-day,--remember to vary the repast, therefore, from Monday round to\r\nSaturday; eschew the corner-shop, and buy as large stores as Leander\r\nwill let you; and always keep near at hand an unexhausted supply of\r\nSolomon's condiment.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[35]\r\n\r\n    \"All hail, thou Connecticut, who forever hast ran,\r\n    Bringing shad to South Hadley, and pleasure to man!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEFORE VICKSBURG.\r\n\r\nMAY 19, 1863.\r\n\r\n\r\n    While Sherman stood beneath the hottest fire\r\n      That from the lines of Vicksburg gleamed,\r\n    And bomb-shells tumbled in their smoky gyre,\r\n      And grape-shot hissed, and case-shot screamed;\r\n          Back from the front there came,\r\n          Weeping and sorely lame,\r\n      The merest child, the youngest face\r\n    Man ever saw in such a fearful place.\r\n\r\n    Stifling his tears, he limped his chief to meet;\r\n      But when he paused, and tottering stood,\r\n    Around the circle of his little feet\r\n      There spread a pool of bright, young blood.\r\n          Shocked at his doleful case,\r\n          Sherman cried, \"Halt! front face!\r\n      Who are you? Speak, my gallant boy!\"\r\n    \"A drummer, Sir:--Fifty-Fifth Illinois.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Are you not hit?\" \"That's nothing. Only send\r\n      Some cartridges: our men are out;\r\n    And the foe press us.\" \"But, my little friend\"--\r\n      \"Don't mind me! Did you hear that shout?\r\n          What if our men be driven?\r\n          Oh, for the love of Heaven,\r\n      Send to my Colonel, General dear!\"\r\n    \"But you?\" \"Oh, I shall easily find the rear.\"\r\n\r\n    \"I'll see to that,\" cried Sherman; and a drop\r\n      Angels might envy dimmed his eye,\r\n    As the boy, toiling towards the hill's hard top,\r\n      Turned round, and with his shrill child's cry\r\n          Shouted, \"Oh, don't forget!\r\n          We'll win the battle yet!\r\n      But let our soldiers have some more,\r\n    More cartridges, Sir,--calibre fifty-four!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR VISIT TO RICHMOND.\r\n\r\nWHY WE WENT THERE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy my companion, the Rev. Dr. Jaquess, Colonel of the Seventy-Third\r\nRegiment of Illinois Volunteers, recently went to Richmond, and the\r\ncircumstances attending his previous visit within the Rebel lines,--when\r\nhe wore his uniform, and mixed openly with scores of leading\r\nConfederates,--I shall shortly make known to the public in a volume\r\ncalled \"Down in Tennessee.\" It may now, however, be asked why I, a\r\n\"civil\" individual, and not in the pay of Government, became his\r\ntravelling-companion, and, at a time when all the world was rushing\r\nNorth to the mountains and the watering-places, journeyed South for a\r\nconference with the arch-Rebel, in the hot and dangerous latitude of\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\nDid it never occur to you, reader, when you have undertaken to account\r\nfor some of the simplest of your own actions, how many good reasons have\r\narisen in your mind, every one of which has justified you in concluding\r\nthat you were of \"sound and disposing understanding\"? So, now, in\r\nlooking inward for the why and the wherefore which I know will be\r\ndemanded of me at the threshold of this article, I find half a dozen\r\nreasons for my visit to Richmond, any one of which ought to prove that I\r\nam a sensible man, altogether too sensible to go on so long a journey,\r\nin the heat of midsummer, for the mere pleasure of the thing. Some of\r\nthese reasons I will enumerate.\r\n\r\nFirst: Very many honest people at the North sincerely believe that the\r\nrevolted States will return to the Union, if assured of protection to\r\ntheir peculiar institution. The Government having declared that no State\r\nshall be readmitted which has not first abolished Slavery, these people\r\nhold it responsible for the continuance of the war. It is, therefore,\r\nimportant to know whether the Rebel States will or will not return, if\r\nallowed to retain Slavery. Mr. Jefferson Davis could, undoubtedly,\r\nanswer that question; and that may have been a reason why I went to see\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nSecond: On the second of July last, C. C. Clay, of Alabama, J. P.\r\nHolcombe, of Virginia, and G. N. Sanders, of nowhere in particular,\r\nappeared at Niagara Falls, and publicly announced that they were there\r\nto confer with the Democratic leaders in reference to the Chicago\r\nnomination. Very soon thereafter, a few friends of the Administration\r\nreceived intimations from those gentlemen that they were Commissioners\r\nfrom the Rebel Government, with authority to negotiate preliminaries of\r\npeace on something like the following basis, namely: A restoration of\r\nthe Union as it was; all negroes actually freed by the war to be\r\ndeclared free, and all negroes not actually freed by the war to be\r\ndeclared slaves.\r\n\r\nThese overtures were not considered sincere. They seemed concocted to\r\nembarrass the Government, to throw upon it the odium of continuing the\r\nwar, and thus to secure the triumph of the peace-traitors at the\r\nNovember election. The scheme, if well managed, threatened to be\r\ndangerous, by uniting the Peace-men, the Copperheads, and such of the\r\nRepublicans as love peace better than principle, in one opposition,\r\nwilling to make a peace that would be inconsistent with the safety and\r\ndignity of the country. It was, therefore, important to discover--what\r\nwas then in doubt--whether the Rebel envoys really had, or had not, any\r\nofficial authority.\r\n\r\nWithin fifteen days of the appearance of these \"Peace Commissioners,\"\r\nJefferson Davis had said to an eminent Secession divine, who, late in\r\nJune, came through the Union lines by the Maryland back-door, that he\r\nwould make peace on no other terms than a recognition of Southern\r\nIndependence. (He might, however, agree to two governments, bound\r\ntogether by a league offensive and defensive,--for all external purposes\r\n_one_, for all internal purposes _two_; but he would agree to nothing\r\nbetter.)\r\n\r\nThere was reason to consider this information trustworthy, and to\r\nbelieve Mr. Davis (who was supposed to be a clear-minded man) altogether\r\nignorant of the doings of his Niagara satellites. If this were true, and\r\nwere proven to be true,--if the _great_ Rebel should reiterate this\r\ndeclaration in the presence of a trustworthy witness, at the very time\r\nwhen the _small_ Rebels were opening their Quaker guns on the\r\ncountry,--would not the Niagara negotiators be stripped of their false\r\ncolors, and their low schemes be exposed to the scorn of all honest men,\r\nNorth and South?\r\n\r\nI may have thought so; and that may have been another reason why I went\r\nto Richmond.\r\n\r\nThird: I had been acquainted with Colonel Jaquess's peace-movements from\r\ntheir inception. Early in June last he wrote me from a battle-field in\r\nGeorgia, announcing his intention of again visiting the Rebels, and\r\nasking an interview with me at a designated place. We met, and went to\r\nWashington together. Arriving there, I became aware that obstacles were\r\nin the way of his further progress. Those obstacles could be removed by\r\nmy accompanying him; and that, to those who know the man and his\r\n\"mission,\" which is to preach peace on earth and good-will among men,\r\nwould seem a very good reason why I went to Richmond.\r\n\r\nFourth,--and this to very many may appear as potent as any of the\r\npreceding reasons,--I had in my boyhood a strange fancy for\r\nchurch-belfries and liberty-poles. This fancy led me, in\r\nschool-vacations, to perch my small self for hours on the cross-beams in\r\nthe old belfry, and to climb to the very top of the tall pole which\r\nstill surmounts the little village-green. In my youth, this feeling was\r\nsimply a spirit of adventure; but as I grew older it deepened into a\r\nreverence for what those old bells said, and a love for the principle of\r\nwhich that old liberty-pole is now only a crumbling symbol.\r\n\r\nHad not events shown that Jeff. Davis had never seen that old\r\nliberty-pole, and never heard the chimes which still ring out from that\r\nold belfry? Who knew, in these days when every wood-sawyer has a\r\n\"mission,\" but _I_ had a \"mission,\" and it was to tell the Rebel\r\nPresident that Northern liberty-poles still stand for Freedom, and that\r\nNorthern church-bells still peal out, \"Liberty throughout the land, to\r\n_all_ the inhabitants thereof\"?\r\n\r\nIf that _was_ my mission, will anybody blame me for fanning Mr. Davis\r\nwith a \"blast\" of cool Northern \"wind\" in this hot weather?\r\n\r\nBut enough of mystification. The straightforward reader wants a\r\nstraightforward reason, and he shall have it.\r\n\r\nWe went to Richmond because we hoped to pave the way for negotiations\r\nthat would result in peace.\r\n\r\nIf we should succeed, the consciousness of having served the country\r\nwould, we thought, pay our expenses. If we should fail, but return\r\nsafely, we might still serve the country by making public the cause of\r\nour failure. If we should fail, and _not_ return safely, but be shot or\r\nhanged as spies,--as we might be, for we could have no protection from\r\nour Government, and no safe-conduct from the Rebels,--two lives would be\r\nadded to the thousands already sacrificed to this Rebellion, but they\r\nwould as effectually serve the country as if lost on the battle-field.\r\n\r\nThese are the reasons, and the only reasons, why we went to Richmond.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW WE WENT THERE.\r\n\r\nWe went there in an ambulance, and we went together,--the Colonel and I;\r\nand though two men were never more unlike, we worked together like two\r\nbrothers, or like two halves of a pair of shears. That we got _in_ was\r\nowing, perhaps, to me; that we got _out_ was due altogether to him; and\r\na man more cool, more brave, more self-reliant, and more self-devoted\r\nthan that quiet \"Western parson\" it never was my fortune to encounter.\r\n\r\nWhen the far-away Boston bells were sounding nine, on the morning of\r\nSaturday, the sixteenth of July, we took our glorious Massachusetts\r\nGeneral by the hand, and said to him,--\r\n\r\n\"Good bye. If you do not see us within ten days, you will know we have\r\n'gone up.'\"\r\n\r\n\"If I do not see you within that time,\" he replied, \"I'll demand you;\r\nand if they don't produce you, body and soul, I'll take two for\r\none,--better men than you are,--and hang them higher than Haman. My hand\r\non that. Good bye.\"\r\n\r\nAt three o'clock on the afternoon of the same day, mounted on two\r\nraw-boned relics of Sheridan's great raid, and armed with a letter to\r\nJeff. Davis, a white cambric handkerchief tied to a short stick, and an\r\nhonest face,--this last was the Colonel's,--we rode up to the Rebel\r\nlines. A ragged, yellow-faced boy, with a carbine in one hand, and\r\nanother white handkerchief tied to another short stick in the other,\r\ncame out to meet us.\r\n\r\n\"Can you tell us, my man, where to find Judge Ould, the Exchange\r\nCommissioner?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yas. Him and t'other 'Change officers is over ter the plantation beyont\r\nMiss Grover's. Ye'll know it by its hevin' nary door nur winder [the\r\nmansion, he meant]. They's all busted in. Foller the bridle-path through\r\nthe timber, and keep your rag a-flyin', fur our boys is thicker 'n\r\nhuckelberries in them woods, and they mought pop ye, ef they didn't seed\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nThanking him, we turned our horses into the \"timber,\" and, galloping\r\nrapidly on, soon came in sight of the deserted plantation. Lolling on\r\nthe grass, in the shade of the windowless mansion, we found the\r\nConfederate officials. They rose as we approached; and one of us said to\r\nthe Judge,--a courteous, middle-aged gentleman, in a Panama hat, and a\r\nsuit of spotless white drillings,--\r\n\r\n\"We are late, but it's your fault. Your people fired at us down the\r\nriver, and we had to turn back and come overland.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't suppose they saw your flag?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. It was hidden by the trees; but a shot came uncomfortably near us.\r\nIt struck the water, and ricochetted not three yards off. A little\r\nnearer, and it would have shortened me by a head, and the Colonel by two\r\nfeet.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would have been a sad thing for you; but a miss, you know, is as\r\ngood as a mile,\" said the Judge, evidently enjoying the \"joke.\"\r\n\r\n\"We hear Grant was in the boat that followed yours, and was struck while\r\nat dinner,\" remarked Captain Hatch, the Judge's Adjutant,--a gentleman,\r\nand about the best-looking man in the Confederacy.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed! Do you believe it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, of course\"; and his looks asked for an answer. We gave\r\nnone, for all such information is contraband. We might have told him\r\nthat Grant, Butler, and Foster examined their position from Mrs.\r\nGrover's house,--about four hundred yards distant,--two hours after the\r\nRebel cannon-ball danced a break-down on the Lieutenant-General's\r\ndinner-table.\r\n\r\nWe were then introduced to the other officials,--Major Henniken of the\r\nWar Department, a young man formerly of New York, but now scorning the\r\nimputation of being a Yankee, and Mr. Charles Javins, of the\r\nProvost-Guard of Richmond. This latter individual was our shadow in\r\nDixie. He was of medium height, stoutly built, with a short, thick neck,\r\nand arms and shoulders denoting great strength. He looked a natural-born\r\njailer, and much such a character as a timid man would not care to\r\nencounter, except at long range of a rifle warranted to five twenty\r\nshots a minute, and to hit every time.\r\n\r\nTo give us a _moonlight view_ of the Richmond fortifications, the Judge\r\nproposed to start after sundown; and as it wanted some hours of that\r\ntime, we seated ourselves on the ground, and entered into conversation.\r\nThe treatment of our prisoners, the _status_ of black troops, and\r\nnon-combatants, and all the questions which have led to the suspension\r\nof exchanges, had been good-naturedly discussed, when the Captain,\r\nlooking up from one of the Northern papers we had brought him, said,--\r\n\r\n\"Do you know, it mortifies me that you don't hate us as we hate you? You\r\nkill us as Agassiz kills a fly,--because you love us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course we do. The North is being crucified for love of the South.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you love us so, why don't you let us go?\" asked the Judge, rather\r\ncurtly.\r\n\r\n\"For that very reason,--because we love you. If we let you go, with\r\nslavery, and your notions of 'empire,' you'd run straight to barbarism\r\nand the Devil.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'd take the risk of that. But let me tell you, if you are going to\r\nMr. Davis with any such ideas, you might as well turn back at once. He\r\ncan make peace on no other basis than Independence. Recognition must be\r\nthe beginning, middle, and ending of all negotiations. Our people will\r\naccept peace on no other terms.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you are wrong there,\" said the Colonel. \"When I was here a year\r\nago, I met many of your leading men, and they all assured me they wanted\r\npeace and reunion, even at the sacrifice of slavery. Within a week, a\r\nman you venerate and love has met me at Baltimore, and besought me to\r\ncome here, and offer Mr. Davis peace on such conditions.\"\r\n\r\n\"That may be. Some of our old men, who are weak in the knees, may want\r\npeace on any terms; but the Southern people will not have it without\r\nIndependence. Mr. Davis knows them, and you will find he will insist\r\nupon that. Concede that, and we'll not quarrel about minor matters.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll not quarrel at all. But it's sundown, and time we were 'on to\r\nRichmond.'\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the 'Tribune' cry,\" said the Captain, rising; \"and I hurrah for\r\nthe 'Tribune,' for it's honest, and--I want my supper.\"\r\n\r\nWe all laughed, and the Judge ordered the horses. As we were about to\r\nstart, I said to him,--\r\n\r\n\"You've forgotten our parole.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, never mind that. We'll attend to that at Richmond.\"\r\n\r\nStepping into his carriage, and unfurling the flag of truce, he then led\r\nthe way, by a \"short cut,\" across the cornfield which divided the\r\nmansion from the high-road. We followed in an ambulance drawn by a pair\r\nof mules, our shadow--Mr. Javins--sitting between us and the twilight,\r\nand Jack, a \"likely darky,\" almost the sole survivor of his master's\r\ntwelve hundred slaves, (\"De ress all stole, Massa,--stole by you\r\nYankees,\") occupying the front-seat, and with a stout whip \"working our\r\npassage\" to Richmond.\r\n\r\nMuch that was amusing and interesting occurred during our three-hours'\r\njourney, but regard for our word forbids my relating it. Suffice it to\r\nsay, we saw the \"frowning fortifications,\" we \"flanked\" the \"invincible\r\narmy,\" and, at ten o'clock that night, planted our flag (against a\r\nlamp-post) in the very heart of the hostile city. As we alighted at the\r\ndoorway of the Spotswood Hotel, the Judge said to the Colonel,--\r\n\r\n\"Button your outside-coat up closely. Your uniform must not be seen\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\nThe Colonel did as he was bidden; and, without stopping to register our\r\nnames at the office, we followed the Judge and the Captain up to No. 60.\r\nIt was a large, square room in the fourth story, with an unswept, ragged\r\ncarpet, and bare, white walls, smeared with soot and tobacco-juice.\r\nSeveral chairs, a marble-top table, and a pine wash-stand and\r\nclothes-press straggled about the floor, and in the corners were three\r\nbeds, garnished with tattered pillow-cases, and covered with white\r\ncounterpanes, grown gray with longing for soapsuds and a wash-tub. The\r\nplainer and humbler of these beds was designed for the burly Mr. Javins;\r\nthe others had been made ready for the extraordinary envoys (not envoys\r\nextraordinary) who, in defiance of all precedent and the \"law of\r\nnations,\" had just then \"taken Richmond.\"\r\n\r\nA single gas-jet was burning over the mantel-piece, and above it I saw a\r\n\"writing on the wall\" which implied that Jane Jackson had run up a\r\nwashing-score of fifty dollars!\r\n\r\nI was congratulating myself on not having to pay that woman's\r\nlaundry-bills, when the Judge said,--\r\n\r\n\"You want supper. What shall we order?\"\r\n\r\n\"A slice of hot corn-bread would make _me_ the happiest man in\r\nRichmond.\"\r\n\r\nThe Captain thereupon left the room, and shortly returning, remarked,--\r\n\r\n\"The landlord swears you're from Georgia. He says none but a Georgian\r\nwould call for corn-bread at this time of night.\"\r\n\r\nOn that hint we acted, and when our sooty attendant came in with the\r\nsupper-things, we discussed Georgia mines, Georgia banks, and Georgia\r\nmosquitoes, in a way that showed we had been bitten by all of them. In\r\nhalf an hour it was noised all about the hotel that the two gentlemen\r\nthe Confederacy was taking such excellent care of were from Georgia.\r\n\r\nThe meal ended, and a quiet smoke over, our entertainers rose to go. As\r\nthe Judge bade us good-night, he said to us,--\r\n\r\n\"In the morning you had better address a note to Mr. Benjamin, asking\r\nthe interview with the President. I will call at ten o'clock, and take\r\nit to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well. But will Mr. Davis see us on Sunday?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that will make no difference.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT WE DID THERE.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, after breakfast, which we took in our room with Mr.\r\nJavins, we indited a note--of which the following is a copy--to the\r\nConfederate Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n    \"Spotswood House, Richmond, Va.\r\n\r\n                    \"July 17th, 1864.\r\n\r\n    \"Hon. J. P. Benjamin,\r\n\r\n        \"Secretary of State, etc.\r\n\r\n     \"DEAR SIR,--The undersigned respectfully solicit an interview\r\n     with President Davis.\r\n\r\n     \"They visit Richmond only as private citizens, and have no\r\n     official character or authority; but they are acquainted with\r\n     the views of the United States Government, and with the\r\n     sentiments of the Northern people relative to an adjustment of\r\n     the differences existing between the North and the South, and\r\n     earnestly hope that a free interchange of views between\r\n     President Davis and themselves may open the way to such\r\n     _official_ negotiations as will result in restoring PEACE to\r\n     the two sections of our distracted country.\r\n\r\n     \"They, therefore, ask an interview with the President, and\r\n     awaiting your reply, are\r\n\r\n        \"Truly and respectfully yours.\"\r\n\r\nThis was signed by both of us; and when the Judge called, as he had\r\nappointed, we sent it--together with a commendatory letter I had\r\nreceived, on setting out, from a near relative of Mr. Davis--to the\r\nRebel Secretary. In half an hour Judge Ould returned, saying,--\"Mr.\r\nBenjamin sends you his compliments, and will be happy to see you at the\r\nState Department.\"\r\n\r\nWe found the Secretary--a short, plump, oily little man in black, with a\r\nkeen black eye, a Jew face, a yellow skin, curly black hair, closely\r\ntrimmed black whiskers, and a ponderous gold watch-chain--in the\r\nnorthwest room of the \"United States\" Custom-House. Over the door of\r\nthis room were the words, \"State Department,\" and round its walls were\r\nhung a few maps and battle-plans. In one corner was a tier of shelves\r\nfilled with books,--among which I noticed Headley's \"History,\"\r\nLossing's \"Pictorial,\" Parton's \"Butler,\" Greeley's \"American\r\nConflict,\" a complete set of the \"Rebellion Record,\" and a dozen numbers\r\nand several bound volumes of the \"Atlantic Monthly,\"--and in the centre\r\nof the apartment was a black-walnut table, covered with green cloth, and\r\nfilled with a multitude of \"state-papers.\" At this table sat the\r\nSecretary. He rose as we entered, and, as Judge Ould introduced us, took\r\nour hands, and said,--\r\n\r\n\"I am glad, very glad, to meet you, Gentlemen. I have read your note,\r\nand\"--bowing to me--\"the open letter you bring from ----. Your errand\r\ncommands my respect and sympathy. Pray be seated.\"\r\n\r\nAs we took the proffered seats, the Colonel, drawing off his \"duster,\"\r\nand displaying his uniform, said,--\r\n\r\n\"We thank you for this cordial reception, Mr. Benjamin. We trust you\r\nwill be as glad to hear us as you are to see us.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt I shall be, for you come to talk of peace. Peace is what we\r\nall want.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is, indeed; and for that reason we are here to see Mr. Davis. Can we\r\nsee him, Sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you bring any overtures to him from your Government?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Sir. We bring no overtures and have no authority from our\r\nGovernment. We state that in our note. We would be glad, however, to\r\nknow what terms will be acceptable to Mr. Davis. If they at all\r\nharmonize with Mr. Lincoln's views, we will report them to him, and so\r\nopen the door for official negotiations.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you acquainted with Mr. Lincoln's views?\"\r\n\r\n\"One of us is, fully.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did Mr. Lincoln, _in any way_, authorize you to come here?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Sir. We came with his pass, but not by his request. We say,\r\ndistinctly, we have no official, or unofficial, authority. We come as\r\nmen and Christians, not as diplomatists, hoping, in a frank talk with\r\nMr. Davis, to discover some way by which this war may be stopped.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Gentlemen, I will repeat what you say to the President, and if he\r\nfollows my advice,--and I think he will,--he will meet you. He will be\r\nat church this afternoon; so, suppose you call here at nine this\r\nevening. If anything should occur in the meantime to prevent his seeing\r\nyou, I will let you know through Judge Ould.\"\r\n\r\nThroughout this interview the manner of the Secretary was cordial; but\r\nwith this cordiality was a strange constraint and diffidence, almost\r\namounting to timidity, which struck both my companion and myself.\r\nContrasting his manner with the quiet dignity of the Colonel, I almost\r\nfancied our positions reversed,--that, instead of our being in his\r\npower, the Secretary was in ours, and momently expecting to hear some\r\nunwelcome sentence from our lips. There is something, after all, in\r\nmoral power. Mr. Benjamin does not possess it, nor is he a great man. He\r\nhas a keen, shrewd, ready intellect, but not the _stamina_ to originate,\r\nor even to execute, any great good or great wickedness.\r\n\r\nAfter a day spent in our room, conversing with the Judge, or watching\r\nthe passers-by in the street,--I should like to tell who they were and\r\nhow they looked, but such information is just now contraband,--we called\r\nagain, at nine o'clock, at the State Department.\r\n\r\nMr. Benjamin occupied his previous seat at the table, and at his right\r\nsat a spare, thin-featured man, with iron-gray hair and beard, and a\r\nclear, gray eye full of life and vigor. He had a broad, massive\r\nforehead, and a mouth and chin denoting great energy and strength of\r\nwill. His face was emaciated, and much wrinkled, but his features were\r\ngood, especially his eyes,--though one of them bore a scar, apparently\r\nmade by some sharp instrument. He wore a suit of grayish-brown,\r\nevidently of foreign manufacture, and, as he rose, I saw that he was\r\nabout five feet ten inches high, with a slight stoop in the shoulders.\r\nHis manners were simple, easy, and quite fascinating: and he threw an\r\nindescribable charm into his voice, as he extended his hand, and said to\r\nus,--\r\n\r\n\"I am glad to see you, Gentlemen. You are very welcome to Richmond.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this was the man who was President of the United States under\r\nFranklin Pierce, and who is now the heart, soul, and brains of the\r\nSouthern Confederacy!\r\n\r\nHis manner put me entirely at my ease,--the Colonel would be at his, if\r\nhe stood before Cæsar,--and I replied,--\r\n\r\n\"We thank you, Mr. Davis. It is not often you meet men of our clothes,\r\nand our principles, in Richmond.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not often,--not so often as I could wish; and I trust your coming may\r\nlead to a more frequent and a more friendly intercourse between the\r\nNorth and the South.\"\r\n\r\n\"We sincerely hope it may.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Benjamin tells me you have asked to see me, to\"----\r\n\r\nAnd he paused, as if desiring we should finish the sentence. The Colonel\r\nreplied,--\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Sir. We have asked this interview in the hope that you may suggest\r\nsome way by which this war can be stopped. Our people want peace,--your\r\npeople do, and your Congress has recently said that _you_ do. We have\r\ncome to ask how it can be brought about.\"\r\n\r\n\"In a very simple way. Withdraw your armies from our territory, and\r\npeace will come of itself. We do not seek to subjugate you. We\r\nare not waging an offensive war, except so far as it is\r\noffensive-defensive,--that is, so far as we are forced to invade you to\r\nprevent your invading us. Let us alone, and peace will come at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we cannot let you alone so long as you repudiate the Union. That is\r\nthe one thing the Northern people will not surrender.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know. You would deny to us what you exact for yourselves,--the right\r\nof self-government.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Sir,\" I remarked. \"We would deny you no natural right. But we think\r\nUnion essential to peace; and, Mr. Davis, _could_ two people, with the\r\nsame language, separated by only an imaginary line, live at peace with\r\neach other? Would not disputes constantly arise, and cause almost\r\nconstant war between them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Undoubtedly,--with this generation. You have sown such bitterness at\r\nthe South, you have put such an ocean of blood between the two sections,\r\nthat I despair of seeing any harmony in my time. Our children may forget\r\nthis war, but _we_ cannot.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think the bitterness you speak of, Sir,\" said the Colonel, \"does not\r\nreally exist. _We_ meet and talk here as friends; our soldiers meet and\r\nfraternize with each other; and I feel sure, that, if the Union were\r\nrestored, a more friendly feeling would arise between us than has ever\r\nexisted. The war has made us know and respect each other better than\r\nbefore. This is the view of very many Southern men; I have had it from\r\nmany of them,--your leading citizens.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are mistaken,\" replied Mr. Davis. \"They do not understand Southern\r\nsentiment. How can we feel anything but bitterness towards men who deny\r\nus our rights? If you enter my house and drive me out of it, am I not\r\nyour natural enemy?\"\r\n\r\n\"You put the case too strongly. But we cannot fight forever; the war\r\nmust end at some time; we must finally agree upon something; can we not\r\nagree now, and stop this frightful carnage? We are both Christian men,\r\nMr. Davis. Can _you_, as a Christian man, leave untried any means that\r\nmay lead to peace?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I cannot. I desire peace as much as you do. I deplore bloodshed as\r\nmuch as you do; but I feel that not one drop of the blood shed in this\r\nwar is on _my_ hands,--I can look up to my God and say this. I tried all\r\nin my power to avert this war. I saw it coming, and for twelve years I\r\nworked night and day to prevent it, but I could not. The North was mad\r\nand blind; it would not let us govern ourselves; and so the war came,\r\nand now it must go on till the last man of this generation falls in his\r\ntracks, and his children seize his musket and fight his battle, _unless\r\nyou acknowledge our right to self-government_. We are not fighting for\r\nslavery. We are fighting for Independence,--and that, or extermination,\r\nwe _will_ have.\"\r\n\r\n\"And there are, at least, four and a half millions of us left; so you\r\nsee you have a work before you,\" said Mr. Benjamin, with a decided\r\nsneer.\r\n\r\n\"We have no wish to exterminate you,\" answered the Colonel. \"I believe\r\nwhat I have said,--that there is no bitterness between the Northern and\r\nSouthern _people_. The North, I know, loves the South. When peace comes,\r\nit will pour money and means into your hands to repair the waste caused\r\nby the war; and it would now welcome you back, and forgive you all the\r\nloss and bloodshed you have caused. But we _must_ crush your armies, and\r\nexterminate your Government. And is not that already nearly done? You\r\nare wholly without money, and at the end of your resources. Grant has\r\nshut you up in Richmond. Sherman is before Atlanta. Had you not, then,\r\nbetter accept honorable terms while you can retain your prestige, and\r\nsave the pride of the Southern people?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Davis smiled.\r\n\r\n\"I respect your earnestness, Colonel, but you do not seem to understand\r\nthe situation. We are not exactly shut up in Richmond. If your papers\r\ntell the truth, it is your capital that is in danger, not ours. Some\r\nweeks ago, Grant crossed the Rapidan to whip Lee, and take Richmond. Lee\r\ndrove him in the first battle, and then Grant executed what your people\r\ncall a 'brilliant flank-movement,' and fought Lee again. Lee drove him a\r\nsecond time, and then Grant made another 'flank-movement'; and so they\r\nkept on,--Lee whipping, and Grant flanking,--until Grant got where he is\r\nnow. And what is the net result? Grant has lost seventy-five or eighty\r\nthousand men,--_more than Lee had at the outset_,--and is no nearer\r\ntaking Richmond than at first; and Lee, whose front has never been\r\nbroken, holds him completely in check, and has men enough to spare to\r\ninvade Maryland, and threaten Washington! Sherman, to be sure, _is_\r\nbefore Atlanta; but suppose he is, and suppose he takes it? You know,\r\nthat, the farther he goes from his base of supplies, the weaker he\r\ngrows, and the more disastrous defeat will be to him. And defeat _may_\r\ncome. So, in a military view, I should certainly say our position was\r\nbetter than yours.\r\n\r\n\"As to money: we are richer than you are. You smile; but admit that our\r\npaper is worth nothing,--it answers as a circulating-medium; and we hold\r\nit all ourselves. If every dollar of it were lost, we should, as we have\r\nno foreign debt, be none the poorer. But it _is_ worth something; it has\r\nthe solid basis of a large cotton-crop, while yours rests on nothing,\r\nand you owe all the world. As to resources: we do not lack for arms or\r\nammunition, and we have still a wide territory from which to gather\r\nsupplies. So, you see, we are not in extremities. But if we were,--if we\r\nwere without money, without food, without weapons,--if our whole country\r\nwere devastated, and our armies crushed and disbanded,--could we,\r\nwithout giving up our manhood, give up our right to govern ourselves?\r\nWould _you_ not rather die, and feel yourself a man, than live, and be\r\nsubject to a foreign power?\"\r\n\r\n\"From your stand-point there is force in what you say,\" replied the\r\nColonel. \"But we did not come here to argue with you, Mr. Davis. We\r\ncame, hoping to find some honorable way to peace; and I am grieved to\r\nhear you say what you do. When I have seen your young men dying on the\r\nbattle-field, and your old men, women, and children starving in their\r\nhomes, I have felt I could risk my life to save them. For that reason I\r\nam here; and I am grieved, grieved, that there is no hope.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know your motives, Colonel Jaquess, and I honor you for them; but\r\nwhat can I do more than I am doing? I would give my poor life, gladly,\r\nif it would bring peace and good-will to the two countries; but it would\r\nnot. It is with your own people you should labor. It is they who\r\ndesolate our homes, burn our wheat-fields, break the wheels of wagons\r\ncarrying away our women and children, and destroy supplies meant for our\r\nsick and wounded. At your door lies all the misery and the crime of this\r\nwar,--and it is a fearful, fearful account.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not all of it, Mr. Davis. I admit a fearful account, but it is not\r\n_all_ at our door. The passions of both sides are aroused. Unarmed men\r\nare hanged, prisoners are shot down in cold blood, by yourselves.\r\nElements of barbarism are entering the war on both sides, that should\r\nmake us--you and me, as Christian men--shudder to think of. In God's\r\nname, then, let us stop it. Let us do something, concede something, to\r\nbring about peace. You cannot expect, with only four and a half\r\nmillions, as Mr. Benjamin says you have, to hold out forever against\r\ntwenty millions.\"\r\n\r\nAgain Mr. Davis smiled.\r\n\r\n\"Do you suppose there are twenty millions at the North determined to\r\ncrush us?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do,--to crush your _government_. A small number of our people, a very\r\nsmall number, are your friends,--Secessionists. The rest differ about\r\nmeasures and candidates, but are united in the determination to sustain\r\nthe Union. Whoever is elected in November, he _must be_ committed to a\r\nvigorous prosecution of the war.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Davis still looking incredulous, I remarked,--\r\n\r\n\"It is so, Sir. Whoever tells you otherwise deceives you. I think I know\r\nNorthern sentiment, and I assure you it is so. You know we have a system\r\nof lyceum-lecturing in our large towns. At the close of these lectures,\r\nit is the custom of the people to come upon the platform and talk with\r\nthe lecturer. This gives him an excellent opportunity of learning public\r\nsentiment. Last winter I lectured before nearly a hundred of such\r\nassociations, all over the North,--from Dubuque to Bangor,--and I took\r\npains to ascertain the feeling of the people. I found a unanimous\r\ndetermination to crush the Rebellion and save the Union at every\r\nsacrifice. The majority are in favor of Mr. Lincoln, and nearly all of\r\nthose opposed to him are opposed to him because they think he does not\r\nfight you with enough vigor. The radical Republicans, who go for\r\nslave-suffrage and thorough confiscation, are those who will defeat him,\r\nif he is defeated. But if he is defeated before the people, the House\r\nwill elect a worse man,--I mean, worse for you. It is more radical than\r\nhe is,--you can see that from Mr. Ashley's Reconstruction Bill,--and the\r\npeople are more radical than the House. Mr. Lincoln, I know, is about to\r\ncall out five hundred thousand more men, and I can't see how you _can_\r\nresist much longer; but if you do, you will only deepen the radical\r\nfeeling of the Northern people. They will now give you fair, honorable,\r\n_generous_ terms; but let them suffer much more, let there be a dead man\r\nin every house, as there is now in every village, and they will give you\r\n_no_ terms,--they will insist on hanging every Rebel south of ----.\r\nPardon my terms. I mean no offence.\"\r\n\r\n\"You give no offence,\" he replied, smiling very, pleasantly. \"I wouldn't\r\nhave you pick your words. This is a frank, free talk, and I like you the\r\nbetter for saying what you think. Go on.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was merely going to say, that, let the Northern people once really\r\nfeel the war,--they do not feel it yet,--and they will insist on hanging\r\nevery one of your leaders.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, admitting all you say, I can't see how it affects our position.\r\nThere are some things worse than hanging or extermination. We reckon\r\ngiving up the right of self-government one of those things.\"\r\n\r\n\"By self-government you mean disunion,--Southern Independence?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And slavery, you say, is no longer an element in the contest.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it is not, it never was an _essential_ element. It was only a means\r\nof bringing other conflicting elements to an earlier culmination. It\r\nfired the musket which was already capped and loaded. There are\r\nessential differences between the North and the South that will, however\r\nthis war may end, make them two nations.\"\r\n\r\n\"You ask me to say what I think. Will you allow me to say that I know\r\nthe South pretty well, and never observed those differences?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you have not used your eyes. My sight is poorer than yours, but I\r\nhave seen them for years.\"\r\n\r\nThe laugh was upon me, and Mr. Benjamin enjoyed it.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Sir, be that as it may, if I understand you, the dispute between\r\nyour government and ours is narrowed down to this: Union or Disunion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; or to put it in other words: Independence or Subjugation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then the two governments are irreconcilably apart. They have no\r\nalternative but to fight it out. But it is not so with the people. They\r\nare tired of fighting, and want peace; and as they bear all the burden\r\nand suffering of the war, is it not right they should have peace, and\r\nhave it on such terms as they like?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't understand you. Be a little more explicit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, suppose the two governments should agree to something like this:\r\nTo go to the people with two propositions: say, Peace, with Disunion and\r\nSouthern Independence, as your proposition,--and Peace, with Union,\r\nEmancipation, No Confiscation, and Universal Amnesty, as ours. Let the\r\ncitizens of all the United States (as they existed before the war) vote\r\n'Yes,' or 'No,' on these two propositions, at a special election within\r\nsixty days. If a majority votes Disunion, our government to be bound by\r\nit, and to let you go in peace. If a majority votes Union, yours to be\r\nbound by it, and to stay in peace. The two governments can contract in\r\nthis way, and the people, though constitutionally unable to decide on\r\npeace or war, can elect which of the two propositions shall govern their\r\nrulers. Let Lee and Grant, meanwhile, agree to an armistice. This would\r\nsheathe the sword; and if once sheathed, it would never again be drawn\r\nby this generation.\"\r\n\r\n\"The plan is altogether impracticable. If the South were only one State,\r\nit might work; but as it is, if one Southern State objected to\r\nemancipation, it would nullify the whole thing; for you are aware the\r\npeople of Virginia cannot vote slavery out of South Carolina, nor the\r\npeople of South Carolina vote it out of Virginia.\"\r\n\r\n\"But three-fourths of the States can amend the Constitution. Let it be\r\ndone in that way,--in any way, so that it be done by the people. I am\r\nnot a statesman or a politician, and I do not know just how such a plan\r\ncould be carried out; but you get the idea,--that the PEOPLE shall\r\ndecide the question.\"\r\n\r\n\"That the _majority_ shall decide it, you mean. We seceded to rid\r\nourselves of the rule of the majority, and this would subject us to it\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the majority must rule finally, either with bullets or ballots.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not so sure of that. Neither current events nor history shows that\r\nthe majority rules, or ever did rule. The contrary, I think, is true.\r\nWhy, Sir, the man who should go before the Southern people with such a\r\nproposition, with _any_ proposition which implied that the North was to\r\nhave a voice in determining the domestic relations of the South, could\r\nnot live here a day. He would be hanged to the first tree, without judge\r\nor jury.\"\r\n\r\n\"Allow me to doubt that. I think it more likely he would be hanged, if\r\nhe let the Southern people know the majority couldn't rule,\" I replied,\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\n\"I have no fear of that,\" rejoined Mr. Davis, also smiling most\r\ngood-humoredly. \"I give you leave to proclaim it from every house-top in\r\nthe South.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, seriously, Sir, you let the majority rule in a single State; why\r\nnot let it rule in the whole country?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because the States are independent and sovereign. The country is not.\r\nIt is only a confederation of States; or rather it _was_: it is now\r\n_two_ confederations.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we are not a _people_,--we are only a political partnership?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your very name, Sir, '_United_ States,' implies that,\" said Mr.\r\nBenjamin. \"But, tell me, are the terms you have named--Emancipation, No\r\nConfiscation, and Universal Amnesty--the terms which Mr. Lincoln\r\nauthorized you to offer us?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Sir, Mr. Lincoln did not authorize me to offer you any terms. But I\r\n_think_ both he and the Northern people, for the sake of peace, would\r\nassent to some such conditions.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are _very_ generous,\" replied Mr. Davis, for the first time during\r\nthe interview showing some angry feeling. \"But Amnesty, Sir, applies to\r\ncriminals. We have committed no crime. Confiscation is of no account,\r\nunless you can enforce it. And Emancipation! You have already\r\nemancipated nearly two millions of our slaves,--and if you will take\r\ncare of them, you may emancipate the rest. I had a few when the war\r\nbegan. I was of some use to them; they never were of any to me. Against\r\ntheir will you 'emancipated' them; and you may 'emancipate' every negro\r\nin the Confederacy, but _we will be free_! We will govern ourselves. We\r\n_will_ do it, if we have to see every Southern plantation sacked, and\r\nevery Southern city in flames.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see, Mr. Davis, it is useless to continue this conversation,\" I\r\nreplied; \"and you will pardon us, if we have seemed to press our views\r\nwith too much pertinacity. We love the old flag, and that must be our\r\napology for intruding upon you at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have not intruded upon me,\" he replied, resuming his usual manner.\r\n\"I am glad to have met you, both. I once loved the old flag as well as\r\nyou do; I would have died for it; but now it is to me only the emblem of\r\noppression.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope the day may never come, Mr. Davis, when _I_ say that,\" said the\r\nColonel.\r\n\r\nA half-hour's conversation on other topics--not of public\r\ninterest--ensued, and then we rose to go. As we did so, the Rebel\r\nPresident gave me his hand, and, bidding me a kindly good-bye, expressed\r\nthe hope of seeing me again in Richmond in happier times,--when peace\r\nshould have returned; but with the Colonel his parting was particularly\r\ncordial. Taking his hand in both of his, he said to him,--\r\n\r\n\"Colonel, I respect your character and your motives, and I wish you\r\nwell,--I wish you every good I can wish you consistently with the\r\ninterests of the Confederacy.\"\r\n\r\nThe quiet, straightforward bearing and magnificent moral courage of our\r\n\"fighting parson\" had evidently impressed Mr. Davis very favorably.\r\n\r\nAs we were leaving the room, he added--\r\n\r\n\"Say to Mr. Lincoln from me, that I shall at any time be pleased to\r\nreceive proposals for peace on the basis of our Independence. It will be\r\nuseless to approach me with any other.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we went out, Mr. Benjamin called Judge Ould, who had been waiting\r\nduring the whole interview--two hours--at the other end of the hall, and\r\nwe passed down the stairway together. As I put my arm within that of the\r\nJudge, he said to me,--\r\n\r\n\"Well, what is the result?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing but war,--war to the knife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ephraim is joined to his idols,--let him alone,\" added the Colonel,\r\nsolemnly.\r\n\r\nI should like to relate the incidents of the next day, when we visited\r\nCastle Thunder, Libby Prison, and the hospitals occupied by our wounded;\r\nbut the limits of a magazine-article will not permit. I can only say\r\nthat at sundown we passed out of the Rebel lines, and at ten o'clock\r\nthat night stretched our tired limbs on the \"downy\" cots in General\r\nButler's tent, thankful, devoutly thankful, that we were once again\r\nunder the folds of the old flag.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThus ended our visit to Richmond. I have endeavored to sketch it\r\nfaithfully. The conversation with Mr. Davis I took down shortly after\r\nentering the Union lines, and I have tried to report his exact language,\r\nextenuating nothing, and coloring nothing that he said. Some of his\r\nsentences, as I read them over, appear stilted and high-flown, but they\r\ndid not sound so when uttered. As listened to, they seemed the simple,\r\nnatural language of his thought. He spoke deliberately, apparently\r\nweighing every word, and knowing well that all he said would be given to\r\nthe public.\r\n\r\nHe is a man of peculiar ability. Our interview with him explained to me\r\nwhy, with no money and no commerce, with nearly every one of their\r\nimportant cities in our hands, and with an army greatly inferior in\r\nnumbers and equipment to ours, the Rebels have held out so long. It is\r\nbecause of the sagacity, energy, and indomitable will of Jefferson\r\nDavis. Without him the Rebellion would crumble to pieces in a day; with\r\nhim it may continue to be, even in disaster, a power that will tax the\r\nwhole energy and resources of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe Southern masses want peace. Many of the Southern leaders want\r\nit,--both my companion and I, by correspondence and intercourse with\r\nthem, know this; but there can be no peace so long as Mr. Davis controls\r\nthe South. Ignoring slavery, he himself states the issue,--the only\r\nissue with him,--Union, or Disunion. That is it. We must conquer, or be\r\nconquered. We can negotiate only with the bayonet. We can have peace and\r\nunion only by putting forth all our strength, crushing the Southern\r\narmies, and overthrowing the Southern government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREVIEWS AND LITERARY NOTICES.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Life and Times of Benjamin Franklin._ By JAMES PARTON. New York: Mason\r\nBrothers. Two Volumes. 8vo.\r\n\r\nTo appreciate the importance of this work, we must remember that it\r\ncovers more than three-fourths of a century full of great events, if not\r\nof great men; that it begins with Boston and Philadelphia as small\r\nprovincial towns, and leaves them the thriving capitals of independent\r\nStates; that it finds colonial energy struggling with metropolitan\r\njealousy and ignorance; that it follows the struggle through all its\r\nphases, until the restrictions of the mother became oppression, and the\r\nlove of the children was converted into hatred; that it traces the\r\ngrowth and expansion of American industry,--the dawn of American\r\ninvention, so full of promise,--the development of the principle of\r\nself-government, so full of power,--the bitter contest, so full of\r\nlessons which, used aright, might have spared us more than half the\r\nblood and treasure of the present war.\r\n\r\nTo appreciate the difficulty of this work, we must remember that the\r\ninner and the outer life of the subject of it are equally full of\r\nmarvels; that, beginning by cutting off candle-wicks in a\r\ntallow-chandler's shop in Boston, he ended as the greatest scientific\r\ndiscoverer among those men renowned for science who composed the Royal\r\nSociety of London and the Academy of Sciences of Paris; that, with the\r\naid of an odd volume of the \"Spectator,\" used according to his own\r\nconception of the best way of using it, he made himself master of a\r\npure, simple, graceful, and effective English style; that the opinions\r\nand maxims which he drew from his own observation and reflection have\r\npassed into the daily life of millions, warning, strengthening,\r\ncheering, and guiding; that he succeeded in the most difficult\r\nnegotiations, was a leader of public opinion on the most important\r\nquestions, and, holding his way cheerfully, resolutely, and lovingly to\r\nthe end, left the world wiser in many things, and in some better, for\r\nthe eighty-four years that he had passed in it.\r\n\r\nNor must we forget, that, among the many things which this wonderful old\r\nman did, was to tell us half the story of his own life, and with such\r\nunaffected simplicity, such evident sincerity, and such attractive\r\ngrace, as to make it--as far as it goes--the most perfect production of\r\nits class. Then why attempt to do it over again? is the question that\r\nnaturally springs to every lip, on reading the title of Mr. Parton's\r\nbook.\r\n\r\nMr. Parton has anticipated this question, and answered it.\r\n\"Autobiography is one of the most interesting and valuable kinds of\r\ncomposition; but autobiography can never be accepted _in lieu_ of\r\nbiography, because to no man is the giftie given of seeing himself as\r\nothers see him. Rousseau's Confessions are a miracle of candor: they\r\nreveal much concerning a certain weak, wandering, diseased, miserable,\r\nwicked Jean Jacques; but of that marvellous Rousseau whose writings\r\nthrilled Europe they contain how much? Not one word. Madame D'Arblay's\r\nDiary relates a thousand pleasant things, but it does not tell us what\r\nmanner of person Madame D'Arblay was. Franklin's Autobiography gives\r\nagreeable information respecting a sagacious shopkeeper of Philadelphia,\r\nbut has little to impart to us respecting the grand Franklin, the\r\nworld's Franklin, the philosopher, the statesman, the philanthropist. A\r\nman cannot reveal his best self, nor, unless he is a Rousseau, his\r\nworst. Perhaps he never knows either.\"\r\n\r\nThe basis of Mr. Parton's work is, as the basis of every satisfactory\r\nbiography must be, the writings of its subject. \"After all,\" he says,\r\n\"Dr. Jared Sparks's excellent edition of the 'Life and Works of\r\nFranklin,' is the source of the greater part of the information we\r\npossess concerning him.... The libraries, the public records, and the\r\nprivate collections of England, France, and the United States, were so\r\ndiligently searched by Dr. Sparks, that, though seven previous editions\r\nof the works of Franklin had appeared, he was able to add to his\r\npublication the astonishing number of six hundred and fifty pieces of\r\nDr. Franklin's composition never before collected, of which four hundred\r\nand fifty had never before appeared in print. To unwearied diligence in\r\ncollecting Dr. Sparks added an admirable talent in elucidating. His\r\nnotes are always such as an intelligent reader would desire, and they\r\nusually contain all the information needed for a perfect understanding\r\nof the matter in hand. Dr. Sparks's edition is a monument at once to the\r\nmemory of Benjamin Franklin and to his own diligence, tact, and\r\nfaithfulness.\" We take great pleasure in copying this passage, both\r\nbecause it seems to illustrate the spirit which Mr. Parton brought to\r\nhis task, and because the value of Mr. Sparks's labors have not always\r\nbeen so freely acknowledged by those who have been freest in their use\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nTo a careful study of those volumes Mr. Parton has added patient and\r\nextensive research among the newspapers and magazines of the time, and,\r\napparently, a wide range of general reading. Thus he has filled his work\r\nwith facts, some curious, some new, and all interesting, as well in\r\ntheir bearing upon the times as upon the man. He is a good delver, a\r\ngood sifter, and, what is equally important, a good interpreter,--not\r\nmerely bringing facts to the light, but compelling them to give out,\r\nlike Correggio's pictures, a light of their own. He possesses, too, in\r\nan eminent degree, the power of forming for himself a conception of his\r\nsubject as a whole, keeping it constantly before his mind in the\r\nelaboration of the parts, and thus bringing it vividly before the mind\r\nof the reader. Franklin's true place in history has never before been\r\nassigned him upon such incontrovertible evidence.\r\n\r\nIf we were to undertake to name the parts of this work which have given\r\nus most satisfaction, we should, although with some hesitation, name the\r\nadmirable chapters which Mr. Parton has devoted to Franklin's diplomatic\r\nlabors in England and France. In none of his good works has that great\r\nman been more exposed to calumny, or treated with more barefaced\r\ningratitude by those who profited most by them, than in bringing to\r\nlight the dangerous letters of Hutchinson and Oliver. Even within the\r\nlast few years, the apologetic biographer of John Adams repeats the\r\naccusation of moral obliquity in a tone that would hardly have been\r\nmisplaced in a defence of Wedderburn. Mr. Parton tells the story with\r\ngreat simplicity, and, without entering into any unnecessary\r\ndisquisition, accepts for his commentary upon it Mr. Bancroft's wise,\r\nand, as it seems to us, unanswerable conclusion. \"Had the conspiracy\r\nwhich was thus laid bare aimed at the life of a minister or the king,\r\nany honest man must have immediately communicated the discovery to the\r\nSecretary of State: to conspire to introduce into America a military\r\ngovernment, and abridge American liberty, was a more heinous crime, of\r\nwhich irrefragable evidence had now come to light.\"\r\n\r\nNever, too, was philosopher more severely tried than Franklin was tried\r\nby the colleagues whom Congress sent him, from time to time, as clogs\r\nupon the great wheel which he was turning so skilfully. And this, too,\r\nMr. Parton has set in full light, not by the special pleading of the\r\napologist, but by the documentary researches of the historian.\r\n\r\nThere are some things, however, in this work which we could have wished\r\nsomewhat different from what they are. Mr. Parton's fluent and forcible\r\nstyle sometimes degenerates into flippancy. We could cite many instances\r\nof felicitous expression, some, also, of bad taste, and some of hasty\r\nassertion. \"_Clubable_\" is hardly a good enough word to bear frequent\r\nrepetition. \"This question was a complete baffler\" is too much like\r\nslang to be admitted into the good company which Mr. Parton's sentences\r\nusually keep. We were not aware that \"Physician, heal thyself\" was a\r\nstock classical allusion. We do not believe--for Dante and Milton would\r\nrise up in judgment against us, even if the vast majority of other great\r\nmen did not--that \"it is only second-rate men who have great aims.\" We\r\ndo not believe that the style of the \"Spectator\" is an \"easily imitated\r\nstyle\"; for, of the hundreds who have tried, how many, besides Franklin,\r\nhave really succeeded in imitating it? We do not believe that Latin and\r\nGreek are an \"obstructing nuisance,\" or that the student of Homer and\r\nThucydides and Demosthenes and Plato and Aristotle and Cæsar and Cicero\r\nand Tacitus is merely studying \"the prattle of infant man,\" or \"adding\r\nthe ignorance of the ancients to the ignorance he was born with.\" We\r\nbelieve, on the contrary, that it was by such studies that Gibbon and\r\nNiebuhr and Arnold and Grote acquired their marvellous power of\r\ndiscovering historical truth and detecting historical error, and that\r\nfrom no modern language could they have received such discipline.\r\n\r\nBut we not only agree with the sentiment, but admire the simple energy\r\nof the expression, when he says that \"Franklin was the man of all others\r\nthen alive who possessed in the greatest perfection the four grand\r\nrequisites for the successful observation of Nature or the pursuit of\r\nliterature,--a sound and great understanding, patience, dexterity, and\r\nan independent income.\" Equally judicious and equally well-expressed is\r\nthe following passage upon the Penns:--\"Thomas Penn was a man of\r\nbusiness, careful, saving, and methodical. Richard Penn was a\r\nspendthrift. Both were men of slender abilities, and not of very\r\nestimable character. They had done some liberal acts for the Province,\r\nsuch as sending over presents to the Library of books and apparatus, and\r\ncannon for the defence of Philadelphia. If the Pennsylvanians had been\r\nmore submissive, they would doubtless have continued their benefactions.\r\nBut, unhappily, they cherished those erroneous, those Tory notions of\r\nthe rights of sovereignty which Lord Bute infused into the contracted\r\nmind of George III., and which cost that dull and obstinate monarch,\r\nfirst, his colonies, and then his senses. It is also rooted in the\r\nBritish mind, that a landholder is entitled to the particular respect of\r\nhis species. These Penns, in addition to the pride of possessing acres\r\nby the million, felt themselves to be the lords of the land they owned,\r\nand of the people who dwelt upon it.\" And in speaking of English ideas\r\nof American resistance:--\"Englishmen have made sublime sacrifices to\r\nprinciple, but they appear slow to believe that any other people can.\"\r\nAnd, \"George III. sat upon a constitutional throne, but he had an\r\nunconstitutional mind.\" It would be difficult to find a more\r\ncomprehensive sentence than the following:--\"The counsel employed by Mr.\r\nMauduit was Alexander Wedderburn, a sharp, unprincipled Scotch\r\nbarrister, destined to scale all the heights of preferment which\r\nshameless subserviency could reach.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to multiply examples, but we have given, we believe,\r\nmore than enough to show that we look upon Mr. Parton's \"Franklin\" as a\r\nwork of very great value.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Maine Woods._ By HENRY D. THOREAU, Author of \"A Week on the Concord\r\nand Merrimack Rivers,\" \"Walden,\" \"Excursions,\" etc., etc. Boston:\r\nTicknor & Fields.\r\n\r\nThe steadily growing fame of Thoreau has this characteristic, that it\r\nis, like his culture, a purely American product, and is no pale\r\nreflection of the cheap glories of an English reprint. Whether he would\r\nhave gained or lost by a more cosmopolitan training or criticism is not\r\nthe question now; but certain it is that neither of these things went to\r\nthe making of his fame. Classical and Oriental reading he had; but\r\nbeyond these he cared for nothing which the men and meadows of Concord\r\ncould not give, and for this voluntary abnegation, half whimsical, half\r\nsublime, the world repaid him with life-long obscurity, and will yet\r\nrepay him with permanent renown.\r\n\r\nHis choice of subjects, too, involves the same double recompense; for no\r\nbooks are less dazzling or more immortal than those whose theme is\r\nexternal Nature. Nothing else wears so well. History becomes so rapidly\r\noverlaid with details, and its aspects change so fast, that the most\r\nelaborate work soon grows obsolete; while a thoroughly sincere and\r\ncareful book on Nature cannot be superseded, and lives forever. Its\r\nbasis is real and permanent. There will always be birds and flowers,\r\nnights and mornings. The infinite fascinations of mountains and of\r\nforests will outlast this war, and the next, and the race that makes the\r\nwar. The same solidity of material which has guarantied permanence to\r\nthe fame of Izaak Walton and White of Selborne will as surely secure\r\nthat of Thoreau, who excels each of these writers upon his own ground,\r\nwhile superadding a wider culture, a loftier thought, and a fine, though\r\nfantastic, literary skill. All men may not love Nature, but all men\r\nultimately love her lovers. And of those lovers, past or present,\r\nThoreau is the most profound in his devotion, and the most richly\r\nrepaid.\r\n\r\nAgainst these great merits are to be set, no doubt, some formidable\r\nliterary defects: an occasional mistiness of expression, like the summit\r\nof Katahdin, as he himself describes it,--one vast fog, with here and\r\nthere a rock protruding; also, an occasional sandy barrenness, like his\r\nbeloved Cape Cod. In truth, he never quite completed the transition from\r\nthe observer to the artist. With the power of constructing sentences as\r\nperfectly graceful as a hemlock-bough, he yet displays the most wayward\r\naptitude for literary caterpillars'-nests and all manner of\r\ndisfigurements. The same want of artistic habit appears also in his\r\nwilful disregard of all rules of proportion. He depicts an Indian, for\r\ninstance, with such minute observation and admirable verbal skill that\r\none feels as if neither Catlin nor Schoolcraft ever saw the actual\r\ncreature; but though the table-talk of the aboriginal may seem for a\r\ntime more suggestive than that of Coleridge or Macaulay, yet there is a\r\npoint beyond which his, like theirs, becomes a bore.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these drawbacks, one finds in Thoreau an unnecessary\r\ndefiance of tone, and a very resolute non-appreciation of many things\r\nwhich a larger mental digestion can assimilate without discomfort. In\r\nhis dealings with Nature he is sweet, genial, patient, wise. In his\r\ndealings with men he exasperates himself over the least divergence from\r\nthe desired type. Before any over-tendency to the amenities and luxuries\r\nof civilization, in particular, he becomes unreasonable and relentless.\r\nHence there appears something hard and ungenial in his views of life,\r\nutterly out of keeping with the delicate tenderness which he shows in\r\nthe woods. The housekeeping of bees and birds he finds noble and\r\nbeautiful, but for the home and cradle of the humblest human pair he can\r\nscarcely be said to have even toleration; a farmer's barn he considers a\r\ncumbrous and pitiable appendage, and he lectures the Irish women in\r\ntheir shanties for their undue share of the elegancies of life. With\r\ninfinite faith in the tendencies of mineral and vegetable nature, in\r\nhuman nature he shows no practical trust, and must even be severe upon\r\nthe babies in the Maine log-huts for playing with wooden dolls instead\r\nof pine-cones. It is, indeed, noticeable that he seems to love every\r\nother living animal more unreservedly than the horse,--as if this poor\r\nsophisticated creature, though still a quadruped and a brother, had been\r\nso vitiated by undue intimacy with man as to have become little better\r\nthan if he wore broadcloth and voted.\r\n\r\nYet there was not in Thoreau one trait of the misanthrope; his solitary\r\nlife at Walden was not chosen because he loved man less, but because he\r\nloved Nature more; and any young poet or naturalist might envy the\r\nopportunities it gave him. But his intellectual habits showed always a\r\ntendency to exaggeration, and he spent much mental force in fighting\r\nshadows, Church and State, war and politics,--a man of solid vigor must\r\nfind room in his philosophy to tolerate these matters for a time, even\r\nif he cannot cordially embrace them. But Thoreau, a celibate, and at\r\ntimes a hermit, brought the Protestant extreme to match the Roman\r\nCatholic, and though he did not personally ignore one duty of domestic\r\nlife, he yet held a system which would have excluded wife and child,\r\nhouse and property. His example is noble and useful to all high-minded\r\nyoung people, but only when interpreted by a philosophy less exclusive\r\nthan his own. In urging his one social panacea, \"Simplify, I say,\r\nsimplify,\" he failed to see that all steps in moral or material\r\norganization are really efforts after the same process he recommends.\r\nThe sewing-machine is a more complex affair than the needle, but it\r\nsimplifies every woman's life, and helps her to that same comparative\r\nfreedom from care which Thoreau would seek only by reverting to the\r\nIndian blanket.\r\n\r\nBut many-sided men do not move in battalions, and even a one-sided\r\nphilosopher may be a boon to think of, if he be as noble as Thoreau. His\r\nvery defects are higher than many men's virtues, and his most fantastic\r\nmoralizings will bear reading without doing harm, especially during a\r\nPresidential campaign. Of his books, \"Walden\" will probably be\r\npermanently reckoned as the best, as being the most full and deliberate\r\nexhibition of the author's mind, and as extracting the most from the\r\nleast material. It is also the most uniform in texture, and the most\r\ncomplete in plan, while the \"Week\" has no unity but that of the\r\nchronological epoch it covers,--a week which is probably the most\r\ncomprehensive on record, ranging from the Bhagvat-Geetha to the \"good\r\ntime coming,\"--and the \"Excursions\" no unity but that of the covers\r\nwhich comprise them, being, indeed, a compilation of his earliest and\r\nlatest essays. Which of his four volumes contains his finest writing it\r\nwould really be hard to say; but in structure the present book comes\r\nnearest to \"Walden\"; it is within its limits a perfect monograph of the\r\nMaine woods. All that has been previously written fails to portray so\r\nvividly the mysterious life of the lonely forest,--the grandeur of\r\nKatahdin or Ktaadn, that hermit-mountain,--and the wild and adventurous\r\nnavigation of those Northern water-courses whose perils make the boating\r\nof the Adirondack region seem safe and tame. The book is also more\r\nunexceptionably healthy in its tone than any of its predecessors, and it\r\nis pleasant to find the author, on emerging from his explorations,\r\nadmitting that the confines of civilization afford, after all, the best\r\nresidence, and that the wilderness is of most value as \"a resource and a\r\nbackground.\"\r\n\r\nThere yet remain for publication Thoreau's adventures on Cape Cod; his\r\nfew public addresses on passing events, especially those on the Burns\r\nRescue and the John-Brown affair, which were certainly among the very\r\nablest productions called forth by those exciting occasions; his poems;\r\nand his private letters to his friend Blake, of Worcester, and to\r\nothers,--letters which certainly contain some of his toughest, and\r\nperhaps also some of his finest writing. All these deserve, and must one\r\nday receive, preservation. He who reads most books reads that which has\r\na merely temporary interest, and will be presently superseded by\r\nsomething better; but Nature has waited many centuries for Thoreau, and\r\nwe can hardly expect to see, during this generation, another mortal so\r\nfavored with her confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Jennie Juneiana_: Talks on Women's Topics. By JENNIE JUNE. Boston: Lee\r\n& Shepard. 12mo. pp. 240.\r\n\r\nGreat are the resources of human invention, and the tiresome passion for\r\nalliterative titles may possibly have culminated in some name yet more\r\nfoolish than that of this little green and gold volume. If so, the rival\r\nhas proved too much for the trump of Fame to carry, and has dropped\r\nunnoticed. In the present case, the title does perhaps some injustice to\r\nthe book, which is not a silly one, though it contains very silly\r\nthings. It seems to be written from the point of view afforded by a\r\nsecond-rate New-York boarding-house, and by a person who has never come\r\nin contact with any refined or well-bred people. With this allowance, it\r\nis written in the interest of good manners and good morals, and with\r\nenough of natural tact to keep the writer from getting far beyond her\r\ndepth, although she does talk of \"Goethe's Mignion\" and \"Miss\r\nWerner,\"--whoever these personages may be,--and of \"the substantial fame\r\nachieved by the unknown author of 'Rutledge.'\" It is written in the\r\nprevalent American newspaper-style,--a style which is apt to be graphic,\r\npiquant, and dashing, accompanied by a flavor, slight or more than\r\nslight, of flippancy and slang,--a style such as reaches high-tide in\r\ncertain \"popular\" native authors, male and female, and in ebbing strands\r\nus on \"Jennie June.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, writing from the windows of Mrs. Todgers, \"Jennie\" manifests\r\nthe usual superfluous anxiety of her kind not to be called\r\nstrong-minded. She is prettily indignant at the thought of female\r\nphysicians: there is nothing improper in having diseases, but to cure\r\nthem would be indelicacy indeed. Girls out of work, who wish for places\r\nin shops, are only \"patriotic young ladies who desire to fill all the\r\nlucrative situations at present occupied by young men.\" She would even\r\nbanish Bridget from the kitchen and substitute unlimited Patricks, which\r\nwill interest housekeepers as being the only conceivable remedy worse\r\nthan the disease. Of course, a female lecturer is an abomination:\r\n\"Jennie\" proves, first, that a \"strong-minded woman\" must be either\r\nunmarried or unhappy in marriage, and then turns, with rather illogical\r\nwrath, upon Lucy Stone and Antoinette Brown, for being too domestic to\r\nmake speeches since their marriage. To follow the court phraseology,\r\n\"This reminds us of a little anecdote.\" When the fashion of long,\r\nflowing wigs was just vanishing in Boston, somebody wore one from that\r\ntown down to Salem, where they were entirely extinct. All the\r\nstreet-boys ran after him all the morning, to ask him why he wore a wig.\r\nHe, wishing to avoid offence, left it in the house at dinner-time; and\r\nwas pursued all the afternoon by the same boys, with the inquiry why he\r\ndid _not_ wear a wig. These eloquent women find it equally hard to\r\nplease their little critic by silence or by speech. The simple truth\r\nprobably is, that they hold precisely the same views which they always\r\nheld, and will live to trouble her yet, when the epoch of the nursery is\r\nover. The majority of women's-rights advocates have always been wives\r\nand mothers, and, for aught we know, excellent ones, since that dear,\r\nmotherly old Quakeress, Lucretia Mott, first broached the matter; and\r\nthe great change in our legislation on all the property-rights of that\r\nsex is just as directly traceable to their labors as is the repeal of\r\nthe English corn-laws to the efforts of the \"League.\" If, however,\r\n\"Jennie\" consoles herself with the reflection that the points made in\r\nthis controversy by the authors of \"Hannah Thurston\" and \"Miss Gilbert's\r\nCareer\" are not much stronger than her own, she must remember her\r\nfavorite theory, that all foolishness sounds more respectable when\r\nuttered from masculine lips.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Woman and her Era._ By ELIZA W. FARNHAM. In Two Volumes. New York:\r\nA. J. Davis & Co.\r\n\r\n2. _Eliza Woodson; or, The Early Days of one of the World's Workers._ A\r\nStory of American Life. New York: A. J. Davis & Co.\r\n\r\nIn the three and a half centuries since Cornelius Agrippa, no one has\r\nattempted with so much ability as Mrs. Farnham to transfer the theory of\r\nwoman's superiority from the domain of poetry to that of science. Second\r\nto no American woman save Miss Dix in her experience as a practical\r\nphilanthropist, she has studied human nature in the sternest practical\r\nschools, from Sing-Sing to California. She justly claims for her views\r\nthat they have been maturing for twenty-two years of \"experience so\r\nvaried as to give it almost every form of trial which could fall to the\r\nintellectual life of any save the most favored women.\" Her books show,\r\nmoreover, an ardent love of literature and some accurate scientific\r\ntraining,--though her style has the condensation and vigor which active\r\nlife creates, rather than the graces of culture.\r\n\r\nThe essence of her book lies in this opening syllogism:--\r\n\r\n\"Life is exalted in proportion to its organic and functional complexity;\r\n\r\n\"Woman's organism is more complex and her totality of function larger\r\nthan those of any other being inhabiting our earth;\r\n\r\n\"Therefore her position in the scale of life is the most exalted,--the\r\nsovereign one.\"\r\n\r\nThis is compactly stated and quite unequivocal, although the three last\r\nwords of the conclusion are a step beyond the premises, and the main\r\nfight of her opponents would no doubt be made on her definition of the\r\nword _being_. The assumption that either sex of a given species is a\r\ndistinct \"being\" cannot probably be slid into the minor premise of the\r\nargument without some objection from the opposing counsel. However, this\r\nbrings us at once to the main point, and the chapter called \"The Organic\r\nArgument,\" which opens with this syllogism, is really the pith of the\r\nbook, and would, perhaps, stand stronger without the other six hundred\r\npages. In this chapter she shows the strength of a system-maker, in the\r\nrest the weaknesses of one; she feels obliged to apply her creed to\r\neverything, to illustrate everything by its light, to find unexpected\r\nconfirmations everywhere, and to manipulate all the history of art,\r\nliterature, and society, till she conforms them all to her standard. She\r\nrecites, with no new power, historical facts that are already familiar;\r\nand gives many pages to extracts from very well known poets and very ill\r\nknown prose-writers, to the exclusion of her own terse and vigorous\r\nthought. All this is without a trace of book-making, but is done in\r\nsingle-hearted zeal for views which are only damaged by the process.\r\n\r\nThese are merely literary defects; but Mrs. Farnham really suffers in\r\nthought by the same unflinching fidelity to her creed. It makes her\r\nclear and resolute in her statement; but it often makes her as one-sided\r\nas the advocates of male supremacy whom she impugns. To be sure, her\r\ntheory enables her to extenuate some points of admitted injustice to\r\nwoman,--finding, for instance, in her educational and professional\r\nexclusions a crude effort, on the part of society, to treat her as a\r\nsort of bird-of-paradise, born only to fly, and therefore not needing\r\nfeet. Yet this authoress is obliged to assume a tone of habitual\r\nantagonism towards men, from which the advocates of mere equality are\r\nexcused. Indeed, the technical Woman's-Rights movement has always\r\nwitnessed a very hearty coöperation among its advocates of both sexes,\r\nand it is generally admitted that men are at least as ready to concede\r\nadditional rights as women to ask for them. But when one comes to Mrs.\r\nFarnham's stand-point, and sees what her opinion of men really is, the\r\nstanchest masculine ally must shrink from assigning himself to such a\r\ncategory of scoundrels. The best criticism made on Michelet's theory of\r\nwoman as a predestined invalid was that of the sensible physician who\r\nresponded, \"As if the Almighty did not know how to create a woman!\"--and\r\nMrs. Farnham certainly proves too much in undertaking to expose the\r\nblunders of Deity in the construction of a man. Assuming, as she\r\ninvariably does, the highest woman to be the typical woman, and the\r\nlowest man to be the typical man, she can prove anything she pleases.\r\nBut even this does not content her; every gleam of tenderness and\r\nrefinement exhibited by man she transfers by some inexplicable\r\nlegerdemain of logic to the feminine side, and makes somehow into a new\r\nproof of his hopeless inferiority; and she is landed at last in the\r\namazing paradox, that \"the most powerful feminine souls have appeared in\r\nmasculine forms, thus far in human career.\" (Vol. II. p. 360.)\r\n\r\nIn short, her theory involves a necessity of perpetual overstatement.\r\nThe conception of a pure and noble young man, such as Richter delineates\r\nin his Walt or Albano, seems utterly foreign to her system; and of that\r\nfine subtilty of nature by which the highest types of manhood and\r\nwomanhood approach each other, as if mutually lending refinement and\r\nstrength, she seems to have no conception. The truth is, that, however\r\nmuch we may concede to the average spiritual superiority of woman, a\r\ngreat deal also depends on the inheritance and the training of the\r\nindividual. Mrs. Farnham, like every refined woman, is often shocked by\r\nthe coarseness of even virtuous men; but she does not tell us the other\r\nside of the story,--how often every man of refinement has occasion to be\r\nshocked by the coarseness of even virtuous women. Sexual disparities may\r\nbe much; but individual disparities are even more.\r\n\r\nMrs. Farnham is noble enough, and her book is brave and wise enough, to\r\nbear criticisms which grow only from her attempting too much. The\r\ndifference between her book and most of those written on the other side\r\nis, that in the previous cases the lions have been the painters, and\r\nhere it is the lioness. As against the exaggerations on the other side,\r\nshe has a right to exaggerate on her part. As against the theory that\r\nman is superior to woman because he is larger, she has a right to plead\r\nthat in that case the gorilla were the better man, and to assert on the\r\nother hand that woman is superior because smaller,--Emerson's mountain\r\nand squirrel. As against the theory that glory and dominion go with the\r\nbeard, she has a right to maintain (and that she does with no small\r\npungency) that Nature gave man this appendage because he was not to be\r\ntrusted with his own face, and needed this additional covering for his\r\nshame. As against the historical traditions of man's mastery, she does\r\nwell to urge that creation is progressive, and that the megalosaurus was\r\nmaster even before man. It is, indeed, this last point which constitutes\r\nthe crowning merit of the book, and which will be permanently associated\r\nwith Mrs. Farnham's name. No one before her has so firmly grasped this\r\nkey to woman's historic position, that the past was an age of coarse,\r\npreliminary labor, in which her time had not yet come. This theory, as\r\nelucidated by Mrs. Farnham, taken with the fine statement of Buckle as\r\nto the importance of the intuitive element in the feminine intellect,\r\n(which statement Mrs. Farnham also quotes,) constitutes the most\r\nvaluable ground logically conquered for woman within this century. These\r\ncontributions are eclipsed in importance only by those actual\r\nachievements of women of genius,--as of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Rosa\r\nBonheur, and Harriet Hosmer,--which, so far as they go, render all\r\nargument superfluous.\r\n\r\nIn this domain of practical achievement Mrs. Farnham has also labored\r\nwell, and the autobiography of her childish years, when she only aspired\r\nafter such toils, has an interest wholly apart from that of her larger\r\nwork, and scarcely its inferior. Except the immortal \"Pet Marjorie,\" one\r\ncan hardly recall in literature a delineation so marvellous of a\r\nchildish mind so extraordinary as \"Eliza Woodson.\" The few characters\r\nappear with an individuality worthy of a great novelist; every lover of\r\nchildren must find it altogether fascinating, and to the most\r\nexperienced student of human nature it opens a new chapter of startling\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Cliff-Climbers; or, The Lone Home in the Himalayas._ A Sequel to\r\n\"The Plant-Hunters.\" By CAPTAIN MAYNE REID, Author of \"The Desert Home,\"\r\n\"The Boy-Hunters,\" etc., etc. With Illustrations.

He has not, however, dealt quite fairly by his\r\nboy-friends. He kept them waiting several years for the completion of\r\n\"The Plant-Hunters,\" and it is only now that he has found time to add\r\n\"The Cliff-Climbers\" as a sequel to that fascinating story. While we\r\nthank him for the book that gives us farther acquaintance with those\r\nstirring individuals, Karl and Caspar, we cannot help reminding him how\r\nlong ago it is since we read \"The Plant-Hunters,\" and wished for more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECENT AMERICAN PUBLICATIONS\r\n\r\nRECEIVED BY THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nPoetry of the Age of Fable.
