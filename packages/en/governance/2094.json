Pleasure of receiving your Letter dated at York the 23d of\r\nNovr last, which mentions your having before written to me by a young\r\nGentn Capt Romane who was to pass through this Place in his Return to\r\nFrance. That Letter has not yet come to Hand. I shall regard all your\r\nRecommendations with the utmost Respect.\r\n\r\nOur military Affairs in the middle Department are in such a Situation\r\nas to afford us too much Reason to be chagrind. We have indeed sufferd\r\nno shameful Defeats, but a promising Campaign has however ended\r\ningloriously. To what are we to attribute it? I believe to a miserable\r\nSet of General Officers. I mean to make some Exceptions. For the Sake\r\nof our Country, my dear Friend, let me ask, Is our Army perpetually to\r\nbe an unanimated one; because there is not Fortitude enough to remove\r\nthose bad Men. I remember the Factions in Carthage which prevented her\r\nmaking herself the Mistress of the World. We may avoid Factions and yet\r\nrid our Army of idle cowardly or drunken officers. HOW was Victory\r\nsnatchd out of our Hands at German Town! Was not this owing to the same\r\nCause? And Why was only one General officer dischargd? Was it because\r\nthere were just Grounds to suspect only one? Is there not Reason to\r\nfear that our Commander in Chief may one day suffer in his own\r\nCharacter by Means of these worthless Creatures? May he not suffer\r\nunder the Reputation of an unfortunate Commander, than which I think he\r\ncannot suffer a greater Evil. It is difficult to seperate from the\r\nMinds of the People the Idea of unfortunate from that of the Want of\r\nsome necessary soldierly Quality. At best the unfortunate General has\r\nPity only as the Reward of his Services; and how soon does Pity\r\ndegenerate into Contempt. Cicero if I mistake not some where tells us,\r\nthat when a General is fortunate it matters not whether it is ascribd\r\nto his being a Favorite of the Immortal Gods, or to certain good\r\nQualities in him which others are incapable of observing. His Soldiers\r\nwill encounter every Danger under his Conduct. His Enemies will be\r\nconfounded at his Approach. His Country will revere him. The Reverse is\r\nequally just. As therefore we regard the Reputation of the Comdr in\r\nChief of our Armies, which is of the greatest Importance to our\r\nAffairs, let us promote this Winter a strict Scrutiny into the Causes\r\nof this unfortunate Campaign. Our Affairs are far from wearing a\r\ndesperate Aspect. Our Successes at the Northward must give us\r\nReputation abroad; and Reputation is a Kind of real Strength. That our\r\nMen are brave, Brandy Wine & German-town can witness. Let us then give\r\nthem officers worthy of them, and Heaven will prosper our righteous\r\nCause. There is indeed one thing which to me appears threatning. It is\r\nabsolutely necessary that the Commissarial Departmt should be restored\r\nto a better State, or the Army will soon suffer. This my dear Sir\r\nrequires your speedy Return to Congress. Did the Army suffer or was it\r\nin Danger of suffering before the Alterations in that Department the\r\nlast Summer, why then should we not put it upon its old Footing &\r\nprevail upon the former Commissary, who is the fittest Man I know, to\r\nact again in that office.1 I have been favord with a Letter from Dr Lee\r\nsince his Return to Paris from Berlin.2 The Powers of Europe I\r\nperceive, are too timid, or too intent upon enslaving others, to\r\nespouse the Cause of Liberty in America. No Matter, my Friend. We shall\r\nnot be obligd to them; and they will hereafter be more sensible of our\r\nImportance when they find that we have struggled thro our Difficulties\r\nwithout them. We shall do greater Honor to our Selves and our Cause;\r\nand those Liberties for which we pay so dear a Price will be more\r\njustly & more highly valued by our selves and our Posterity. France, in\r\nmy Opinion, misses the Sight of her true Interest in delaying to take a\r\ndecisive Part. She runs a great Risque; for if Britain should be so\r\npolitick as to recognize our Independence which she sees us determind\r\nat all Hazzards to maintain, and should propose to us a Treaty of\r\nAlliance offensive & defensive, would not the flattering Expectations\r\nof France be cut off? I mention this, not because I expect or wish for\r\nit. But should such Recognition & such Proposals be made the next\r\nSpring, which may happen, would France have any Reason to fault America\r\nfor acceeding to it? We are independent. The Nations of Europe may\r\nacknowledge it when they dare to do it. We have Fortitude enough to\r\nmaintain it. This is our Business. The Nations may reap honest\r\nAdvantages from it. If they have not Wisdom enough to discern in\r\nSeason, they will regret their own Blindness hereafter. We will dispose\r\nour Favors as we please.\r\n\r\nThe Letter from Congress to the Assembly of this State, inclosing the\r\nArticles of Confederation, came to Hand the Day of its Adjournment,\r\nwhich is to a shorter Day than was intended that the weighty Matters\r\nrecommended might be considerd with all possible Speed. The Assembly\r\nwill meet on the 7th Instant. It will be difficult for the Members to\r\nprevail upon themselves to make a new Law after having been\r\nnecessitated so late to repeal one framed for the same purpose. A Comt\r\nhowever I am inclind to think will be appointed to meet those of the\r\nother States mentiond in the recommendation. The Articles of\r\nConfederation seem to be well liked. I suppose you will have the Sense\r\nof this Assembly soon.\r\n\r\nI am much pleasd with a spirited Act lately made by your Assembly for\r\nthe Supply of our Troops and the beneficial Effects it has had. I am\r\nnot in much Pain about Cloathing for this year. A large Quantity has\r\nbeen lately brought here by the Agent of the Clothier General--Part of\r\nwhich has been made & I suppose by this time arrivd at Camp. The\r\nTaylors and others are busily employd. Every Method should nevertheless\r\nbe tryed for further Supplys. A Superabundance will not be amiss. Laws\r\nin other States similar to yours will eventually facilitate this Part\r\nof our Work.\r\n\r\nI understand that our Army is gone or going into Winter Quarters at the\r\nDistance of 18 Miles from Philadelphia. Why could not Barracks have\r\nbeen as well erected near enough to have.... the Enemy all the Winter.\r\nOur Army was within three or four miles of them the whole Winter when\r\nthey were in this Town. I hope the Campaign will be opend by us very\r\nearly the next Spring.\r\n\r\nI should have written to you before this time, but on my Arrival here I\r\nfound the Genl Assembly sitting, unluckily for me as it engagd me in\r\npublick Business; and I have been obligd to spend a Fortnight in the\r\nCountry.\r\n\r\nAdieu my friend & believe me to be affectionately,\r\n\r\nYour,\r\n\r\n1 Cf., vol. iii., page 317.\r\n\r\n2 Wharton, Revolutionary Diplomatic Correspondence, vol. i., p. 517.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO --------------.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON Jany 10 1778\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR/\r\n\r\nThe General Assembly of this State having sat the greatest part of the\r\nTime since I arrivd here & the Council constantly has prevented my\r\nwriting so often to my Friends, and when I have wrote, so fully as I\r\nhave an Inclination to do. The Assembly is now sitting, and have made\r\nChoice of Mr Cushing Mr Pain and a Country Gentleman1 whose Name I do\r\nnot now recollect, to join Committees of other States at New Haven\r\nagreable to a late Recommendation of Congress. But having been obligd\r\nso lately to repeal an Act of a similar Nature to that which is now\r\nproposd, I am doubtful whether they will be prevaild upon to pass a new\r\none. It will however have its due Consideration if the joynt Comtes\r\nshould propose such a Measure. I expect every Day to have the Articles\r\nof Confederation brot forward, and have good Reason to think it will be\r\nagreed to, even those parts which it may be wishd had been different,\r\nfor the Sake of that Union which is so necessary for the Support of the\r\ngreat Cause.\r\n\r\nThe Resolutions of Congress recommending passing a Law similar to that\r\nlately passed in Virginia &c were yesterday read at the Council Board.\r\nI had the Oppty of hearing them read once, so that I cannot yet form my\r\nJudgment of them. Indeed I think it is easy to see the Necessity of\r\nsuch a Law as that of Virginia, but whether it would be practicable to\r\nput into Execution a Law prohibiting the Sale of Goods without Licence\r\nrequires Consideration for Nothing more betrays the Weakness of\r\nGovernment than to make Laws wch cannot be executed. I am sensible it\r\nis nearly of as much Importance to suppress the Monopolizers as to\r\nprovide for our Army, but the blow must be levelled at them only. If\r\nthe Popular Indignation can once be raisd to a suitable Pitch as I\r\nthink it can it will become dangerous for them to withhold their Goods\r\nor demand an exorbitant Price for them and the Evil will be cured. I\r\nthink every Step should be taken for the Downfall of such Wretches, and\r\nshall be ready to joyn in any Measure within Doors or without which\r\nshall be well adapted to this Effect.\r\n\r\nIt is the general Observation of those who are in the way of observing\r\nthat the sinking our State bills for Notes & thereby lessening the\r\nQuantity in Circulation & the Taxes we have laid has already reduced\r\nthe price of Goods.\r\n\r\nThis was mentioned to me by Mr S A Otis with whom I have just dined.\r\n\r\nI have written to Bro Gerry by the Baron De Steuben whom I strongly\r\nrecommend to the Notice of my worthy Colleagues & others. Mr Gerry will\r\nshew you my Letter, which makes it needless for me to add further than\r\nthat from the recommendatory Letters of Dr Franklin & other papers wch\r\nI have seen & the Conversation I have had with the Baron, I really\r\nesteem him a modest candid & sensible Gentn. The Dr says he is spoken\r\nhighly of to him by two of the best Judges of military merit in France,\r\ntho he is not him self a Frenchman but a Prussian.\r\n\r\nSince I last wrote to you I am favord with yours of 27 Decr inclosing\r\namong other papers Copy of a Letter from your Correspondent in Holland.\r\nBefore you knew the Contents I bolted out your Letter in the presense &\r\nhearing of Madam & other good Ladies. I cannot promise you that\r\nMischief is not done. I am endeavoring (and Mr Gerry will say it is\r\njust like him) to turn the torrent toward Braintree; for I really think\r\nmy Namesake is full as suspectable as I am. I thank Mrs Clymer for her\r\ngood opinion of me, and I can assure her, the Hint you gave me of this\r\nin your Letter to me was very timely & is likely to make Matters easy\r\nwith me.\r\n\r\nI might have dated this Letter at the Council table where I am writing\r\nin Haste.\r\n\r\nMy best Regards to all who love our Country in Sincerity. Colo Chase\r\ntells me your Son behaves well & that he is very clever.\r\n\r\nYour Family is well provided for as I am informd. You will never I am\r\nperswaded think your self under an obligation to baulk your publick\r\nSentiments from an Idea of Gratitude to private Friends. Sat Verbum. I\r\nmay explain my self more fully in another Letter. Adieu my friend.

And although I have no personal Acquaintance\r\nwith him, yet I am well assured that he is a brave Soldier. Such a\r\nCharacter, you, Sir, must esteem; and this is also the Character of\r\nColo Webb. I have not been insensible of the Obstruction which may have\r\nhitherto prevented the Exchange of Colo Allen, and the true Source of\r\nit. If private or partial Motives have prevaild in the Mind of any\r\nGentleman in New York, to the Prejudice of a Man of distinguishd Merit,\r\nI can only observe, that it is totally inconsistent with those pure\r\nPrinciples, which you will allow me to say, have, and I trust ever will\r\nactuate Americans in the present Contest. You will excuse my saying any\r\nmore to you on so delicate a Point.\r\n\r\nI sincerely wish the Release of every man in Captivity; and shall for\r\nmy own part be well pleasd with your availing your self of an Exchange\r\nwith either of the above mentiond Gentlemen, if it may be consistent\r\nwith the Sentiments of Congress.\r\n\r\nMy first Concern is for the Honor & Safety of my Country. Having\r\npremised this, I can readily subscribe with due Respect,\r\n\r\nYr very hbl Servt,\r\n\r\n1 An officer in the English army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HORATIO GATES.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON Jan 14 1778\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR\r\n\r\nYesterday I took the Liberty of writing to you by the Baron De Steuben\r\na Native of Prussia who I doubt not will deliver the Letter into your\r\nHand. He will previously wait on Genl Washington to whom he has Letters\r\nof warm Recommendation from the Commissioners of America in France. He\r\nhas also Letters to Mr President Laurens and other Members of Congress\r\nfrom gentlemen of Note in that Country. He offers his Services to\r\nAmerica as a Volunteer; wishing to give no Offence by interfering in\r\nCommand. He appears to me to be a modest, candid & sensible Gentleman;\r\nand, I have Reason to think, from the Letters I have seen, he has great\r\nmilitary Merit. Of this you will be able to form a decisive Judgment.\r\n\r\nThere is a certain Canadian Officer, by the Name of Laurens Olivier, a\r\nCaptain, whose Character and warm Attachment to our Cause while he was\r\nan Inhabt of Canada, my Friend Mr Thos Walker a Gentn well known to Mr\r\nGerry, speaks highly of. This Officer will make known certain\r\nDifficulties he is under to you. I am told he is a deserving Man; Such\r\na Character I may with Confidence recommend to your patronage. You may\r\nrely upon it I will never willingly trouble my self or you with persons\r\nof a different sort.\r\n\r\nI am &c,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOTE OF TOWN OF BOSTON.\r\n\r\n[MS., Boston City Clerk's Office; the text, with variations, is in\r\nBoston Record Commissioners' Report, vol. xviii., p. 298.]\r\n\r\n[January 21, 1778.]\r\n\r\nThe Articles of Confederation and perpetual Union between the several\r\nStates now represented in the Continental Congress, having been laid\r\nbefore this Town, were distinctly and repeatedly read and maturely\r\nconsiderd, Whereupon; Resolvd, as the opinion of this Town, that the\r\nsaid Articles appear to be well adapted to cement the Union of the said\r\nStates, to confirm their mutual Friendship, establish their Freedom and\r\nIndependence, and promote their general Welfare: And the\r\nRepresentatives of the Town are hereby instructed, to give their Votes\r\nin the General Assembly, that the Delegates of this State may be\r\nauthorizd to ratify the said Articles of Confederation in order that\r\nthe same may become conclusive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN BURGOYNE.1\r\n\r\n[MS., Public Record Office, London; a draft is in the Samuel Adams\r\nPapers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON Febry 6th, 1778.\r\n\r\nSIR\r\n\r\nI should not have failed yesterday to have returned an Answer to your\r\nLetter, which was brought to me the preceding Evening, had it not been\r\nfor the violence of a Disorder which had seized me near a Week before.\r\nThat Disorder still continues to afflict me much, and prevents my\r\nseeing any one but my physician, or doing any business even of the most\r\ntrifling Nature.\r\n\r\nUnder such Circumstances, you will excuse me if I decline to engage\r\nwith you in Conversation, upon a subject in which you think the general\r\nCause of Humanity and possibly the essential Interests of both our\r\nCountries are concerned.\r\n\r\nI have the Honor to be\r\n\r\nSir\r\n\r\nYour most humble Servt\r\n\r\n1 Lieutenant General in the English army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DANIEL ROBERDEAU.1\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nFeb 9 1778\r\n\r\nSIR\r\n\r\nI have not been unmindful of the favor you did me in writing to me some\r\ntime ago. My not having returnd an Answer has been owing, I do assure\r\nyou, altogether to many Avocations, and at last to a bodily disorder by\r\nwhich I have been confind to my House and great part of the time upon\r\nmy bed for near a fortnight. I am now about my Room and gladly take the\r\nOpportunity to drop from my Pen an Expression of the honest Friendship\r\nwhich I feel for your self and your agreable Connections.\r\n\r\nI find by the Letters I receive from Mr Lovell who is kind enough to\r\nwrite to me often, that Congress is reduced to a small Number present.\r\nThis has not been unusual in the Winter Season. But you have a great\r\nDeal of Business and that of the arduous Kind. It would be a strong\r\nInducement to me to leave domestick Enjoymt, that I might take as great\r\na Share of the Burthen with you as my Shoulders would bear. It is no\r\nSatisfaction to me, you may rely upon it, to be able to plead the Want\r\nof Health sufficient to go through so long a Journey at this rigorous\r\nSeason. My Brother Gerry can recollect with how much pleasure the few\r\nwho were at Baltimore passed through the Fatigues of Business the last\r\nWinter, when our Affairs wore a more gloomy Aspect than they have ever\r\nyet done. We did it with Alacrity, because there was a Spirit of Union\r\nwhich leads to wise & happy Decisions. I hope the same Spirit now\r\nprevails and that Measures are taking to collect & support an Army and\r\nto introduce (Economy & Discipline among officers of Rank as well as\r\nprivate Soldiers, so as by Gods Blessing to insure us a successful\r\nCampaign. Your Resolution respecting Burgoyne I think must have nettled\r\nhim. I have long with Pain suspected a perfidious Design. This\r\nResolution must have crossd it. It will cause much Speculation in\r\nEurope. No Matter. The Powers there seem more inclind to speculate than\r\nto espouse the Rights of Man. Let them speculate. Our Business is to\r\nsecure America against the Arts & the Arms of a treacherous Enemy. The\r\nformer we have more to apprehend from than the latter.\r\n\r\nPlease to pay my due Regard to your Sisters & Family in which Mrs A\r\ndesires to be joynd & be assured that I am\r\n\r\nYr unfeigned friend\r\n\r\n1 Cf., Appleton's Cyclopaedia of American Biography.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ARTHUR LEE.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON March 12th 1778\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND\r\n\r\nThis Letter will be deliverd to you by Captn Romanet a young French\r\nGentleman Nephew to General Grobouval Commander of the french\r\nArtillery. He is a modest well behaved youth, and is one of Monsr du\r\nCoudrays Corps many of whom I suppose are returnd to France\r\ndissatisfied with the Determination of Congress against ratifying Mr\r\nDean's Compact. The Necessity of doing this was disagreable to the\r\nMembers, but it could not have been otherwise, without causing a great\r\nUneasiness in our Army at a very critical Juncture.

The General Assembly is now under a short\r\nAdjournment, and the Council are not authorizd in their Executive\r\nCapacity & seperate from the House of Repts to order any Part of the\r\nMilitia of this State beyond its Limits. The Assembly will meet on the\r\nfirst Day of the next Month. Your Excellencys Letter, together with\r\nanother receivd this Day from Govr Clinton upon the same Subject, will\r\nthen be laid before that Body; and altho the Government of this State\r\nare now under the Necessity of keeping up more than fifteen hundred of\r\nthe Militia to guard the Troops of Convention & for other extraordinary\r\nService in and about the Town of Boston, yet there can be no Doubt but\r\na due Attention will be given to so interesting & important a Concern\r\nas the Defence of Hudsons river.\r\n\r\nI have the Honor to be with the most cordial Esteem\r\n\r\nYr Excys most Humble Servt\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES LOVELL.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON March 27 1778\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nYou cannot imagine how much I feel my self obligd to you for writing to\r\nme frequently. Your Letters however do not come to me in regular Order.\r\nHOW is it that I did not receive those of the 10th & 16th of Feby by\r\nthe Post till yesterday? I am affraid there is some Deficiency in the\r\nPost office Department; but as I would fain hope our Friend Mr Hastings\r\nis not in Fault, I will beg you in his Behalf, to move to the Post\r\nMaster General for an Addition to his Salary, for he assures me he\r\ncannot live upon what he now receives.\r\n\r\nI am very sorry your Letter of the 10th did not come in Season, for I\r\nshould have gladly interrested my self for so valueable a Citizen as Mr\r\nLeach at the late annual Meeting. I have long wishd that for the\r\nReputation as well as substantial Advantage of this Town a military\r\nAcademy was instituted. When I was in Philadelphia more than two years\r\nago I mentiond the Importance I conceivd it to be of, in Letters to my\r\nFriends here. At least we might set up a publick School for military\r\nMathematicks, and I know of no one better qualified for an Instructor\r\nthan Mr Leach. I wish he had mentiond it to me. Perhaps he may have had\r\nPromises of Attention to him from some other Person upon whom he\r\nrelies. I will consult with such Men of Influence in the Town as I am\r\nacquainted with, and will not be wanting in Endeavors to improve your\r\nHints for the mutual Benefit of the Publick & Mr Leach.\r\n\r\nI am pleasd to observe in your Letter of 28 Feby that Mr Burgoyne seems\r\nto be alterd in his Ideas of Congress. The Gentleman to whom you\r\nrequest me to communicate the Contents of that Letter, I am not in the\r\nleast acquainted with, but shall comply with your Request whenever I\r\nshall find an opportunity of doing it.\r\n\r\nI fear from what you mention in your Letter of the 7th of March that\r\nthe Expectations of the People with Regard to Ty. & Independence will\r\nbe baulkd. If they are, the Cause in my opinion will be injurd & the\r\nConfidence of the People in those who have the Mannagement of our\r\nAffairs civil & military lessend, which I should be very sorry to see.\r\nIn the same Letter you tell me that Lt Colo Anstruthers Request to seek\r\nhis own Release on Condition of his getting Colo Allens is granted. I\r\nnow inclose a Letter which I had mislayed & omitted to send, relating\r\nto Lt Colo Campbells who I wish might be exchanged for Friend Ethan.1\r\n\r\nI do not wonder that you have been mortified upon the Delay of a\r\ncertain Affair to which you refer in your Letter of the 10th Instant. I\r\nwrote you the Opinion of this Town respecting that Affair above a Month\r\nago. I shall only observe that in my opinion, every one who is\r\nintrusted with the Affairs of the Publick does not feel so sensibly for\r\nits Reputation as I think you do. I have inclosd the Instructions of\r\nthe General Assembly to their Delegates in Congress upon the\r\nConfederation, and when I shall have the pleasure of seeing you I may\r\nperhaps give you the Causes why that important Matter was not determind\r\nsooner. I immediately after reading your last mentiond Letter\r\ncommunicated to the Council that part of it which relates to the\r\nPropriety & Necessity of making regular Returns of what is done here in\r\nConsequence of the Recommendations of Congress; and a Committee of that\r\nBoard is now looking over the Journals & Papers for that Purpose. In\r\nthe same Letter you mention your having receivd a Letter from Mr John\r\nAmory, with his Request that you wd put a memorial into Congress for\r\nhim. In what Manner could Congress interpose for him if you should\r\ncomply with his Request? His Residence in this State was deemd by the\r\nGenl Assembly to be dangerous to the State. Will Congress order or\r\nrecommend that He should reside in it notwithstanding? \"He was surprizd\r\ninto an Oath of Allegiance!\" He said upon his Examination here that he\r\nwas not compelled to take the Oath. He did not recollect the Form or\r\nTenor of the Oath he had taken--but desired to live peaceably in his\r\nNative town but could not in Conscience take up Arms against the\r\nBritish King. I will desire Mr Appleton to write to you on the Subject.\r\n\r\n1 Allen.

I receivd it as a singular Favor\r\nand felt the more thankful for it, because I knew that hardly anything\r\ncould induce you to write a Letter but the urgent Affairs of our\r\nCountry or the powerful feelings of private Friendship. I should have\r\nwritten you an Answer sooner but the peevish nominal Saint who scrap'd\r\nan Acquaintance with me at Baltimore the last Winter, has followd me\r\neven to this place. I think he is the most impertinent & troublesome\r\nVisitant I ever had. I am so thoroughly disgusted at the Creature that\r\nI have taken every Method that could be devisd to prevent my being ever\r\nplagud with him again. He seems at length to be about leaving me & he\r\nmay depend upon it I shall deny all his Visits for the future.\r\n\r\nThe Spirit of Avarice, I am sorry to be obligd to say it, prevails too\r\nmuch in this Town; but it rages only among the few, because perhaps,\r\nthe few only are concernd at present in trade. The old substantial\r\nMerchants have generally laid aside trade & left it to Strangers or\r\nthose who from nothing have raisd fortunes by privateering. The Body of\r\nthis Community suffer proportionably as much as the great continental\r\nPublick. It must be confessd that the Charges of Trade are enormous,\r\nand it is natural for men when they have at great Risque & Expence\r\nimported Commodities which are wanted by every body, if they must\r\nreceive in payment for them what is valued by no body, to demand as\r\nmuch of it as they please, especially if it is growing daily into less\r\nRepute. This you know has been the Case. There is but one effectual\r\nRemedy; & that is to lessen the Quantity of circulating paper Money.\r\nThis is now doing here. Our Assembly have laid on a very heavy Tax, &\r\nare determind to repeat it again and again. Besides which they have\r\ncalled in a large Quantity of their bills, for which they have issued\r\nNotes payble with Interest. The Effects are already felt & the prices\r\nof Goods have been for some time past gradually sinking.\r\n\r\nYou tell me we have a great many men now inlisted & that you hope Means\r\nwill be found to collect them. I joyn with you in these hopes, and that\r\nwe may keep them together when they are collected and make a good Use\r\nof them. Howe I understand has fortified himself by a Line of Redoubts\r\nfrom River to River. Has he more than 13 or 14 [sic] Men in America? If\r\nnot why should we wait till he is reinforced before we make an\r\nEnterprize somewhere.\r\n\r\nYour Resolution to stop the Embarkation here I fancy has nettled\r\nBurgoyne. He has since been soliciting Interviews with A & B & wishes\r\nfor private Conversations upon a Matter in which \"he thinks the General\r\nCause of Humanity and possibly the essential Interests of both our\r\nCountries are concernd.\"1 He has not prevaild upon A to comply with his\r\nRequest; for more Reasons than one which I think must be obvious upon a\r\nshort Review of our History. The Resolutions of Congress will afford\r\nMatter of Speculation for the Politicians in Europe. But must they not\r\nall acknowledge that Burgoyne himself had made it necessary? After a\r\nsolemn Declaration made to the very Officer with whom he had enterd\r\ninto the Convention that it was broken on our Part, Does he, if he\r\nbelieves his own Declaration hold him self bound by it on his part?\r\nWould he not, if sufferd to go to Sea, most probably carry a\r\nReinforcement to Genl Howe & laugh at us for puting it in his Power?\r\n\r\nI have twenty things to say to you, but my ill state of Health prevents\r\nmy adding more than that I am, with sincere Regards to Mrs Lee in which\r\nMrs A very cordially joyns\r\n\r\nYr affectione\r\n\r\n1 Cf. page 12.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO RICHARD HENRY LEE.\r\n\r\n[MS., American Philosophical Society.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON April 20 1778\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR----\r\n\r\nI most heartily congratulate you on the happy and important News from\r\nEurope which will be conveyd to Congress by Mr Dean the Brother of our\r\nlate Commissioner who will be so kind as to deliver you this Letter.\r\nFrance has acted with Magnanimity; while Britain continues to discover\r\nthat Meanness and Poverty of Spirit, which renders her still more than\r\never contemptible in the Eyes of all sensible People. The Moderation of\r\nFrance is such as becomes a great and powerful Nation. Britain\r\nforgetfull of her former Character, sinks into Baseness in the Extreme.\r\nThe one is generously holding out the Arm of Protection to a People\r\nmost cruelly oppressd while the other is practicing the Arts of\r\nTreachery and Deceit to subjugate and enslave them. This is a Contrast\r\nwhich an ancient Britain would have blushd to have had predicted to\r\nhim. It is a true Contrast, and we will blush for them.\r\n\r\nCommissioners we are again told are coming out to treat with us. This\r\nis what we had Reason to expect. Her only Design is to amuse us &\r\nthereby to retard our operations, till she can land her utmost Force in\r\nAmerica. We see plainly what Part we are to take; to be before hand of\r\nher; and by an early Stroke to give her a mortal Wound. If we delay our\r\nvigorous Exertions till the Commissioners arrive, the People abroad\r\nmay, many of them will be amusd with the flattering Prospect of Peace,\r\nand will think it strange if we do not consent to a Cessation of Arms\r\ntill propositions can be made and digested. This carries with it an Air\r\nof Plausibility; but from the Moment we are brought into the Snare, we\r\nmay tremble for the Consequence. As there [are] every where awful\r\nTories enough, to distract the Minds of the People, would it not be\r\nwise for the Congress by a Publication of their own to set this\r\nimportant Intelligence in a clear Light before them, and fix in their\r\nMinds the first Impressions in favor of Truth? For I do assure you, it\r\nbegins to be whisperd by the Tories & as soon as they dare to do it\r\nthey will speak aloud, that this is but a french Finesse and that\r\nBritain is the only real Friend of America. Should not the People be\r\ninformd with the Authority of Congress that Britain persists in\r\nclaiming a Right to tax them and that the new or intended Act of\r\nParliament, expressly declares her Intention to be only a Suspension of\r\nthe Exercise of the Right till she shall please again to exercise it?\r\nthat is till she shall have lulled them into a State of Security. That\r\nher Commissioners are not to be vested with full Powers to finish any\r\nTreatys, nor even to promise a Ratification of them. This will be left\r\nin great Uncertainty, till it shall be considerd in Parliament. They\r\nare allowed, as one of our Friends expresses it, to proclaim a\r\nCessation of Hostilities, and revoke their Proclamation, as soon as in\r\nConfidence of it our Militia are allowd to go home. They may suspend\r\nthe Operation of prohibitory Acts of Trade; and take off that\r\nSuspension where our Merchants in Consequence of it shall have been\r\nindued to send their Ships to Sea. In short they may do every thing\r\nthat may tend to distract and divide us, but Nothing that can afford us\r\nSecurity. The British Court have Nothing in View but to divide by Means\r\nof their Commissioners. Of this they entertain sanguine Expectations;\r\nfor I am well assured, that they say they have certain Advice, that\r\nthey have a large Party in Congress, almost a Majority, who are for\r\nreturning to their Dependency! This cannot be true--Dr Franklin in a\r\nLetter of the 2d of March informs me that America at present stands in\r\nthe highest Light of Esteem thro' out Europe, and he adds, A Return to\r\nDependence on England would sink her into Eternal Contempt.\r\n\r\nBe pleasd to present my due Regards to all Friends, and acquaint my\r\nworthy Colleagues that Mr Deans great Haste prevents my writing to\r\nthem. I intend to set out on my Journy to York Town next Week where I\r\nhope for the Pleasure of seeing you. In the mean time be assured that I\r\nam\r\n\r\nYour affectionate,\r\n\r\nI thank you for your\r\n\r\nFavor of Mar 1st which\r\n\r\nI recd three days ago--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPALMER 84 Miles from Boston\r\n\r\nMay 5th 1778\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BETSY\r\n\r\nI wrote to you by my kind Host Mr Greenleafe. Yesterday I left his\r\nHouse and slept the last Night at Colo Henshaws. He and his Lady\r\ntreated me with great Hospitality & Friendship. This day I dined at\r\nBrookfield with Mr Ward a Minister in that Town. He married Miss\r\nColeman Mr Pembertons Niece. I am much obligd to them for their kind\r\nTreatment of me. I made them promise to visit you when they go to\r\nBoston. This Afternoon I met my Son on the Road. I was sorry I could\r\nnot have the Pleasure of conversing with him. I parted with him with\r\ngreat Regret. May Heaven bless him! Tell him I shall never think him\r\ntoo old to hearken to the Advice of his Father. Indeed I never had\r\nReason to complain of him on that Account. He has hitherto made me a\r\nglad Father. This implys that I esteem him a wise Son. I have been the\r\nmore sparing of Advice to him because I have thought he did not need\r\nit; but in these critical Times when Principles & Manners as well as\r\nthe Liberties of his Country are in Danger he has need to be on his\r\nGuard. My Children cannot imagine how much Comfort I have in believing\r\nthey are virtuous. I am not willing to admit of a Fear that they will\r\never deprive me of this Comfort. My warm Affections are due to my\r\nFamily and Friends. Adieu my dear Betsy.\r\n\r\nYour affectionate,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"AN AMERICAN\" TO THE EARL OF CARLISLE AND OTHERS.\r\n\r\n[W. V. Wells,1 Life of Samuel Adams, vol. iii., pp. 18-26; printed in\r\nthe Massachusetts Spy, July 16, 1778.]\r\n\r\nTo the Earl of Carlisle, Lord Viscount Howe, Sir William Howe (or, in\r\nhis absence, Sir Henry Clinton), William Eden, and George Johnstone.\r\n\r\nTrusty and well-beloved servants of your sacred master, in whom he is\r\nwell pleased.\r\n\r\nAs you are sent to America for the express purpose of treating with\r\nanybody and anything, you will pardon an address from one who disdains\r\nto flatter those whom he loves. Should you therefore deign to read this\r\naddress, your chaste ears will not be offended with the language of\r\nadulation,--a language you despise.\r\n\r\nI have seen your most elegant and most excellent letter \"to his\r\nExcellency, Henry Laurens, the President, and other members of the\r\nCongress.\" As that body have thought your propositions unworthy their\r\nparticular regard, it may be some satisfaction to your curiosity, and\r\ntend to appease the offended spirit of negotiation, if one out of the\r\nmany individuals on this great continent should speak to you the\r\nsentiments of America,--sentiments which your own good sense hath\r\ndoubtless suggested, and which are repeated only to convince you that,\r\nnotwithstanding the narrow ground of private information on which we\r\nstand in this distant region, still a knowledge of our own rights, and\r\nattention to our own interests and a sacred respect for the dignity of\r\nhuman nature, have given us to understand the true principles which\r\nought, and which therefore shall, sway our conduct.\r\n\r\nYou begin with the amiable expressions of humanity, the earnest desire\r\nof tranquillity and peace. A better introduction to Americans could not\r\nbe devised. For the sake of the latter, we once laid our liberties at\r\nthe feet of your Prince, and even your armies have not eradicated the\r\nformer from our bosoms.\r\n\r\nYou tell us you have powers unprecedented in the annals of your\r\nhistory. And England, unhappy England, will remember with deep\r\ncontrition that these powers have been rendered of no avail by a\r\nconduct unprecedented in the annals of mankind. Had your royal master\r\ncondescended to listen to the prayer of millions, he had not thus have\r\nsent you. Had moderation swayed what we were proud to call \"mother\r\ncountry\" her full-blown dignity would not have broken down under her.\r\n\r\nYou tell us that all \"parties may draw some degree of consolation, and\r\neven auspicious hope, from recollection.\" We wish this most sincerely\r\nfor the sake of all parties. America, in the moment of subjugation,\r\nwould have been consoled by conscious virtue, and her hope was, and is,\r\nin the justice of her cause and the justice of the Almighty. These are\r\nsources of hope and of consolation which neither time nor chance can\r\nalter or take away.\r\n\r\nYou mention \"the mutual benefits and consideration of evils that may\r\nnaturally contribute to determine our resolutions.\" As to the former,\r\nyou know too well that we could derive no benefit from a union with\r\nyou, nor will I, by deducing the reasons to evince this, put an insult\r\nupon your understandings. As to the latter, it were to be wished you\r\nhad preserved a line of conduct equal to the delicacy of your feelings.\r\nYou could not but know that men who sincerely love freedom disdain the\r\nconsideration of all evils necessary to attain it. Had not your own\r\nhearts borne testimony to this truth, you might have learned it from\r\nthe annals of your own history; for in those annals instances of this\r\nkind at least are not unprecedented. But should those instances be\r\ninsufficient, we pray you to read the unconquered mind of America.\r\n\r\nThat the acts of Parliament you transmitted were passed with singular\r\nunanimity, we pretend not to doubt. You will pardon me, gentlemen, for\r\nobserving that the reasons of that unanimity are strongly marked in the\r\nreport of a committee of Congress agreed to on the 22d of April last,\r\nand referred to in a late letter from Congress to Lord Viscount Howe\r\nand Sir Henry Clinton.\r\n\r\nYou tell us you are willing \"to consent to a cessation of hostilities\r\nboth by sea and land.\" It is difficult for rude Americans to determine\r\nwhether you are serious in this proposition or whether you mean to jest\r\nwith their simplicity. Upon a supposition, however, that you have too\r\nmuch magnanimity to divert yourselves on an occasion of so much\r\nimportance to America, and, perhaps, not very trivial in the eyes of\r\nthose who sent you, permit me to assure you, on the sacred word of a\r\ngentleman, that if you shall transport your troops to England, where\r\nbefore long your Prince will certainly want their assistance, we shall\r\nnever follow them thither. We are not so romantically fond of fighting,\r\nneither have we such regard for the city of London, as to commence a\r\ncrusade for the possession of that holy land. Thus you may be certain\r\nhostilities will cease by land. It would be doing singular injustice to\r\nyour national character to suppose you are desirous of a like cessation\r\nby sea. The course of the war, and the very flourishing state of your\r\ncommerce, notwithstanding our weak efforts to interrupt it, daily show\r\nthat you can exclude us from the sea,--the sea, your kingdom!\r\n\r\nYou offer \"to restore free intercourse, to revive mutual affection, and\r\nrenew the common benefits of naturalization.\" Whenever your countrymen\r\nshall be taught wisdom by experience, and learn from past misfortunes\r\nto pursue their true interests in the future we shall readily admit\r\nevery intercourse which is necessary for the purposes of commerce and\r\nusual between different nations. To revive mutual affection is utterly\r\nimpossible. We freely forgive you, but it is not in nature that you\r\nshould forgive us. You have injured us too much. We might, on this\r\noccasion, give you some instances of singular barbarity committed, as\r\nwell by the forces of his Britannic Majesty as by those of his generous\r\nand faithful allies, the Senecas, Onondagas, and Tuscaroras. But we\r\nwill not offend a courtly ear by the recital of those disgusting\r\nscenes. Besides this, it might give pain to that humanity which hath,\r\nas you observe, prompted your overtures, to dwell upon the splendid\r\nvictories obtained by a licentious soldiery over unarmed men in\r\ndefenceless villages, their wanton devastations, their deliberate\r\nmurders, or to inspect those scenes of carnage painted by the wild\r\nexcesses of savage rage. These amiable traits of national conduct\r\ncannot but revive in our bosoms that partial affection we once felt for\r\neverything which bore the name of Englishman. As to the common benefits\r\nof naturalization, it is a matter we conceive to be of the most\r\nsovereign indifference. A few of our wealthy citizens may hereafter\r\nvisit England and Rome to see the ruins of those august temples in\r\nwhich the goddess of Liberty was once adored. These will hardly claim\r\nnaturalization in either of those places as a benefit. On the other\r\nhand, such of your subjects as shall be driven by the iron hand of\r\nOppression to seek for refuge among those whom they now persecute will\r\ncertainly be admitted to the benefits of naturalization. We labor to\r\nrear an asylum for mankind, and regret that circumstances will not\r\npermit you, gentlemen, to contribute to a design so very agreeable to\r\nyour several tempers and dispositions.\r\n\r\nBut further, your Excellencies say, \"We will concur to extend every\r\nfreedom to trade that our respective interests can require.\"\r\nUnfortunately, there is a little difference in these interests which\r\nyou might not have found it very easy to reconcile, had the Congress\r\nbeen disposed to risk their heads by listening to terms which I have\r\nthe honor to assure you are treated with ineffable contempt by every\r\nhonest Whig in America. The difference I allude to is, that it is your\r\ninterest to monopolize our commerce, and it is our interest to trade\r\nwith all the world. There is, indeed, a method of cutting this Gordian\r\nknot which, perhaps, no statesman is acute enough to untie. By\r\nreserving to the Parliament of Great Britain the right of determining\r\nwhat our respective interests require, they might extend the freedom of\r\ntrade, or circumscribe it at their pleasure, for what they might call\r\nour respective interests. But I trust it would not be for our mutual\r\nsatisfaction. Your \"earnest desire to stop the effusion of blood and\r\nthe calamities of war\" will therefore lead you, on maturer reflection,\r\nto reprobate a plan teeming with discord, and which, in the space of\r\ntwenty years, would produce another wild expedition across the\r\nAtlantic, and in a few years more some such commission as that \"with\r\nwhich his Majesty hath been pleased to honor you.\" We cannot but admire\r\nthe generosity of soul which prompts you \"to agree that no military\r\nforce shall be kept up in the different States of North America without\r\nthe consent of the General Congress or particular Assemblies.\" The only\r\ngrateful return we can make for this exemplary condescension is, to\r\nassure your Excellencies, and, on behalf of my countrymen, I do most\r\nsolemnly promise and assure you, that no military force shall be kept\r\nup in the different States of North America without the consent of the\r\nGeneral Congress and that of the Legislatures of those States. You\r\nwill, therefore, cause the forces of your royal master to be removed;\r\nfor I can venture to assure you that the Congress have not consented,\r\nand probably will not consent, that they be kept up.\r\n\r\nYou have also made the unsolicited offer of concurring \"in measures\r\ncalculated to discharge the debts of America, and to raise the credit\r\nand value of the paper circulation.\" If your Excellencies mean by this\r\nto apply for offices in the department of our finance, I am to assure\r\nyou (which I do with \"perfect respect\") that it will be necessary to\r\nprocure very ample recommendations. For, as the English have not yet\r\npursued measures to discharge their own debt and raise the credit and\r\nvalue of their own paper circulation, but, on the contrary, are in a\r\nfair way to increase the one and absolutely destroy the other, you will\r\ninstantly perceive that financiers from that nation would present\r\nthemselves with the most awkward grace imaginable.\r\n\r\nYou propose to us a device to \"perpetuate our union.\" It might not be\r\namiss previously to establish this union, which may be done by your\r\nacceptance of the treaty of peace and commerce tendered to you by\r\nCongress. And such treaty I can venture to say would continue as long\r\nas your ministers could prevail upon themselves not to violate the\r\nfaith of nations.\r\n\r\nYou offer, to use your language, the inaccuracy of which, considering\r\nthe importance of the subject, is not to be wondered at, or at least\r\nmay be excused, \"in short, to establish the powers of the respective\r\nLegislatures in each particular State, to settle its revenue, its civil\r\nand military establishment, and to exercise a perfect freedom of\r\nlegislation and internal government, so that the British States\r\nthroughout North America, acting with us in peace and war, under one\r\ncommon sovereign, may have the irrevocable enjoyment of every privilege\r\nthat is short of a total separation of interests, or consistent with\r\nthat total union of force on which the safety of our common religion\r\nand liberty depends.\" Let me assure you, gentlemen, that the power of\r\nthe respective Legislatures in each particular State is most fully\r\nestablished, and on the most solid foundations. It is established on\r\nthe perfect freedom of legislation and a vigorous administration of\r\ninternal government. As to the settlement of the revenue and the civil\r\nand military establishment, these are the work of the day, for which\r\nthe several Legislatures are fully competent. I have also the pleasure\r\nto congratulate your Excellencies that the country for the settlement\r\nof whose government, revenue, administration, and the like, you have\r\nexposed yourselves to the fatigues and hazards of a disagreeable voyage\r\nand more disagreeable negotiation, hath abundant resources wherewith to\r\ndefend her liberties now, and pour forth the rich stream of revenue\r\nhereafter. As the States of North America mean to possess the\r\nirrevocable enjoyment of their privileges, it is absolutely necessary\r\nfor them to decline all connection with a Parliament who, even in the\r\nlaws under which you act, reserve in express terms the power of\r\nrevoking every proposition which you may agree to. We have a due sense\r\nof the kind offer you make to grant us a share in your sovereign; but\r\nreally, gentlemen, we have not the least inclination to accept of it.\r\nHe may suit you extremely well, but he is not to our taste. You are\r\nsolicitous to prevent a total separation of interests; and this, after\r\nall, seems to be the gist of the business. To make you as easy as\r\npossible on this subject, I have to observe, that it may, and probably\r\nwill, in some instances, be our interest to assist you, and then we\r\ncertainly shall. Where this is not the case, your Excellencies have\r\ndoubtless too much good sense as well as good nature to require it. We\r\ncannot perceive that our liberty does in the least depend upon any\r\nunion of force with you; for we find that after you have exercised your\r\nforce against us for upwards of three years, we are now upon the point\r\nof establishing our liberties in direct opposition to it. Neither can\r\nwe conceive that, after the experiment you have made, any nation in\r\nEurope will embark in so unpromising a scheme as the subjugation of\r\nAmerica. It is not necessary that everybody should play the Quixote.\r\nOne is enough to entertain a generation at least. Your Excellencies\r\nwill, I hope, excuse me when I differ from you as to our having a\r\nreligion in common with you; the religion of America is the religion of\r\nall mankind. Any person may worship in the manner he thinks most\r\nagreeable to the Deity; and if he behaves as a good citizen, no one\r\nconcerns himself as to his faith or adorations, neither have we the\r\nleast solicitude to exalt any one sect or profession above another.\r\n\r\nI am extremely sorry to find in your letter some sentences which\r\nreflect upon the character of his most Christian Majesty. It certainly\r\nis not kind, or consistent with the principles of philanthropy you\r\nprofess, to traduce a gentleman's character, without affording him an\r\nopportunity of defending himself; and that, too, a near neighbor, and\r\nnot long since an intimate brother, who besides hath lately given you\r\nthe most solid additional proofs of his pacific disposition, and with\r\nan unparalleled sincerity which would do honor to other princes,\r\ndeclared to your Court, unasked, the nature and effect of a treaty he\r\nhad just entered into with these States. Neither is it quite according\r\nto the rules of politeness to use such terms in addressing yourselves\r\nto Congress, when you well knew that he was their good and faithful\r\nally. It is indeed true, as you justly observe, that he hath at times\r\nbeen at enmity with his Britannic Majesty, by which we suffered some\r\ninconveniences; but these flowed rather from our connection with you\r\nthan any ill-will towards us; at the same time it is a solemn truth,\r\nworthy of your serious attention, that you did not commence the present\r\nwar,--a war in which we have suffered infinitely more than by any former\r\ncontest, a fierce, a bloody, I am sorry to add, an unprovoked and cruel\r\nwar,--that you did not commence this, I say, because of any connection\r\nbetween us and our present ally; but, on the contrary, as soon as you\r\nperceived that the treaty was in agitation, proposed terms of peace to\r\nus in consequence of what you have been pleased to denominate an\r\ninsidious interposition. HOW, then, does the account stand between us?\r\nAmerica, being at peace with the world, was formerly drawn into a war\r\nwith France in consequence of her union with Great Britain. At present,\r\nAmerica being engaged in a war with Great Britain, will probably obtain\r\nthe most honorable terms of peace in consequence of her friendly\r\nconnection with France. For the truth of these positions, I appeal,\r\ngentlemen, to your own knowledge. I know it is very hard for you to\r\npart with what you have accustomed yourselves from your earliest\r\ninfancy to call your Colonies. I pity your situation, and therefore I\r\nexcuse the little aberrations from truth which your letter contains. At\r\nthe same time it is possible that you may have been misinformed. For I\r\nwill not suppose that your letter was intended to delude the people of\r\nthese States. Such unmanly, disingenuous artifices have of late been\r\nexerted with so little effect, that prudence, if not probity, would\r\nprevent a repetition. To undeceive you, therefore, I take the liberty\r\nof assuring your Excellencies, from the very best intelligence, that\r\nwhat you call \"the present form of the French offers to America,\" in\r\nother words, the treaties of alliance and commerce between his most\r\nChristian Majesty and these States, were not made in consequence of any\r\nplans of accommodation concerted in Great Britain, nor with a view to\r\nprolong this destructive war. If you consider that these treaties were\r\nactually concluded before the draft of the bills under which you act\r\nwas sent to America, and that much time must necessarily have been\r\nconsumed in adjusting compacts of such intricacy and importance, and\r\nfurther, if you consider the early notification of this treaty by the\r\nCourt of France, and the assurance given that America had reserved a\r\nright of admitting even you to a similar treaty, you must be convinced\r\nof the truth of my assertions. The fact is, that when the British\r\nminister perceived that we were treating with the greatest prince in\r\nEurope, he applied himself immediately to counteract the effect of\r\nthese negotiations. And this leads me, with infinite regret, to make\r\nsome observations which may possibly be by you considered in an\r\noffensive point of view.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me, gentlemen, there is something (excuse the word)\r\ndisingenuous in your procedure. I put the supposition that Congress had\r\nacceded to your propositions, and then I ask two questions:-- Had you full\r\npower from your commission to make these propositions? Possibly you did\r\nnot think it worth your while to consider your commission, but we\r\nAmericans are apt to compare things together and to reason. The second\r\nquestion I ask is, What security could you give that the British\r\nParliament would ratify your compacts? You can give no such security;\r\nand therefore we should, after forfeiting our reputation as a people,\r\nafter you had filched from us our good name, and persuaded us to give\r\nto the common enemy of man the precious jewel of our liberties,--after all\r\nthis, I say, we should have been at the mercy of a Parliament which, to\r\nsay no more of it, has not treated us with too great tenderness. It is\r\nquite needless to add that, even if that Parliament had ratified the\r\nconditions you proposed, still poor America was to lie at the mercy of\r\nany future Parliament, or to appeal to the sword, which certainly is\r\nnot the most pleasant business men can be engaged in.\r\n\r\nFor your use I subjoin the following creed of every good American:--I\r\nbelieve that in every kingdom, state, or empire there must be, from the\r\nnecessity of the thing, one supreme legislative power, with authority\r\nto bind every part in all cases the proper object of human laws. I\r\nbelieve that to be bound by laws to which he does not consent by\r\nhimself, or by his representative, is the direct definition of a slave.\r\nI do therefore believe that a dependence on Great Britain, however the\r\nsame may be limited or qualified, is utterly inconsistent with every\r\nidea of liberty, for the defence of which I have solemnly pledged my\r\nlife and fortune to my countrymen; and this engagement I will sacredly\r\nadhere to so long as I shall live. Amen.\r\n\r\nNow, if you will take the poor advice of one who is really a friend to\r\nEngland and Englishmen, and who hath even some Scotch blood in his\r\nveins,--away with your fleets and your armies, acknowledge the\r\nindependence of America; and as ambassadors, and not commissioners,\r\nsolicit a treaty of peace, amity, commerce, and alliance with the\r\nrising States of this Western world. Your nation totters on the brink\r\nof a stupendous precipice, and even delay will ruin her.\r\n\r\nYou have told Congress, \"if, after the time that may be necessary to\r\nconsider this communication and transmit your answer, the horrors and\r\ndevastations of war should continue, we call God and the world to\r\nwitness that the evils which must follow are not to be imputed to Great\r\nBritain.\" I wish you had spared your protestation. Matters of this kind\r\nmay appear to you in a trivial light, as mere ornamental flowers of\r\nrhetoric, but they are serious things, registered in the high chancery\r\nof Heaven. Remember the awful abuse of words like those by General\r\nBurgoyne, and remember his fate. There is One above us who will take\r\nexemplary vengeance for every insult upon His majesty. You know that\r\nthe cause of America is just. You know that she contends for that\r\nfreedom to which all men are entitled,--that she contends against\r\noppression, rapine, and more than savage barbarity. The blood of the\r\ninnocent is upon your hands, and all the waters of the ocean will not\r\nwash it away. We again make our solemn appeal to the God of heaven to\r\ndecide between you and us. And We pray that, in the doubtful scale of\r\nbattle, we may be successful as we have justice on our side, and that\r\nthe merciful Saviour of the world may forgive our oppressors.\r\n\r\nI am, my Lords and Gentlemen, the friend of human nature, and one who\r\nglories in the title of\r\n\r\nAn American.\r\n\r\n1 Also attributed to Adams in The Remembrancer, 1778, p. 306.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO BARON STEUBEN.\r\n\r\n[MS., Emmet Collection, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nYORK TOWN June 3d 1778\r\n\r\nSIR/\r\n\r\nI very gratefully acknowledge the Receipt of your Favor of the 28th of\r\nMay by Mr Ternant, as well as another which was deliverd to me in\r\nBoston.

Mr\r\nTernants Haste prevents my adding more than that I am with very cordial\r\nEsteem\r\n\r\nYour affectionate\r\n\r\nvery humble servt\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Adams Papers, Quincy.]\r\n\r\nYORK TOWN June 21 1778\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nAlthough we are exceedingly pressd with publick Business at this\r\nJuncture I cannot omit the Opportunity that now offers of writing to\r\nyou. The general Scituation of Affairs, and the particular Transactions\r\nbetween the British Commissioners and the Congress will be transmited\r\nto you by this Conveyance, by the Committee for foreign Affairs. Since\r\nI last came to this Place from Boston, several Gentlemen have arrivd\r\nhere from France viz Mr Simeon Dean, Mr Carmichael, Mr Stephenson, & Mr\r\nHolker. Mr Carmichael comes strongly recommend[ed] by Dr Franklin & Mr\r\nSilas Dean; but Dr Lee in his Letter gives Reasons why he cannot place\r\na Confidence in him. From a long Correspondence with Dr Lee, I conceive\r\nso great an Opinion of his Candor as well as inflexible Integrity &\r\nAttachment to our Country, that I cannot entertain a Doubt that he\r\nwould suffer partial Considerations to operate in his Mind to the\r\nPrejudice of any Man. Such a Difference of Sentiments concerning a\r\nGentleman who I imagine must be of some Consequence, could not take\r\nPlace without at least apparently good Grounds; and it may produce such\r\nEffects on this Side of the Water as may prove uncomfortable to us if\r\nnot injurious to our Cause. Would it not then be doing some Service, to\r\nexercise your Prudence in endeavoring to investigate the real Grounds\r\nof it, in doing which possibly some things may open to View of\r\nImportance and at present not thought of.\r\n\r\nDr Lee is a Gentleman of a fair and generous Mind. I wish therefore\r\nthat you would freely converse with him upon this Subject if you think\r\nyou can do it with Propriety; and let him know that I have lately\r\nreceivd many Letters from him, which I have duly attended to and would\r\nhave acknowledgd to him by this Opportunity, if I had Leisure.\r\n\r\nBy the last Accounts I have had from Braintree your Lady & Family were\r\nin Health, though anxiously wishing to hear of your safe Arrival.\r\n\r\nI shall write to you as often as I can & shall esteem my self happy in\r\nreceiving your Favors.\r\n\r\nI remain very affectionately\r\n\r\nYour Friend,\r\n\r\nTO MRS. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADE July 9 1778\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BETSY\r\n\r\nMr Mc Lean the Bearer of this Letter arrivd in this City yesterday, and\r\ntells me he saw you on the Day he left Boston, and that you were then\r\nin Health. He now returns in so great Haste as to afford me Time only\r\nto let you know that I still enjoy that inestimable Blessing. I now\r\nwrite at the Table in Congress, having just put my Hand to the\r\nConfederation with my Colleagues & the Delegates of seven other States.\r\nNorth Carolina and Georgia whose Members are absent have acceded to the\r\nConfederation. Mr H has just obtaind the Leave of Absence and is going\r\nhome on Account of his ill State of Health & the Circumstances of his\r\nFamily. He tells me his Wife is dangerously ill.\r\n\r\nAdieu my dear,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES WARREN.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADE July -- 1778\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nCapt Manley1 has obligd me with your favor of the 5th. He and McNeil\r\nare both here with different Views. The one to obtain another Ship, and\r\nthe other to get the Sentence of the Court Martial by which he is\r\ncensurd & broke, reversd. Perhaps both may be disappointed. I have\r\nreceivd a Number of Letters by both. One from you. To this I shall pay\r\na very particular Regard, because I am well satisfied you never suffer\r\nPrejudices to divert your Attention from the great object--the publick\r\nGood. \"Manly is a blunt, honest and I believe brave officer.' I observe\r\nyour Caution; and I admire it because I think it is a proof of your\r\nIntegrity. Manlys Bravery is an Article of your Beliefe. His Bluntness&\r\nHonesty, of Certainty. I have not yet lookd into the Papers; but I\r\nrecollect, when they were read in Congress, to have heard the Want of\r\nExperience imputed to him, and some thing that had the Appearance of\r\nblameing him for not giving out any Signals for the Direction of the\r\nShips under his Command. This it must be ownd, strongly implys the Want\r\nif not the total Absense of Discretion. Now I would ask my Friend,\r\nwhether the Character of a blunt & honest officer entitles him to the\r\nCommand of one of our Capital Ships if he is \"deficient in point of\r\nExperience & Discretion.\" The Characteristick of a Sailor is the blunt\r\nhonest Tar. They carry this Character to an inimitable Height. But\r\nsurely every honest blunt or even brave Tar is not fit for Command in\r\nour Navy. I some times fear there was an Error in the beginning. Thus\r\nmuch for Manly. \"His Address (viz Mc Neils) is insinuating. His\r\nAssurance great. He may tell you fine Storys\" &c. How contemptible does\r\nhe appear. I should think he had taken a Lesson from Hutchinsons\r\npolitical Book, if I had not Reason to believe that he used to despise\r\nhim most heartily. But I advert to a Letter from another of my Friends\r\nto whose upright opinions I have always given Weight; there I find \"He\r\nis open & sincere'' Synonimous Terms with blunt & honest. \"His Temper\r\nis naturally warm which he has sometimes indulgd in speaking his Mind\r\nfreely of Persons in office\"--This you know has always been deemd an\r\nunpardonable Sin, and I am affraid it always will be. To be sure it\r\nalways will be so deemd by that Kind of Men in office who meet with\r\nnone to hinder them from persisting in the most expensive Blunders but\r\nthe open sincere and warm Friends of our Country. I am warrented in\r\nsupposing this Character belongs to Capt Mc Neil, because my worthy\r\nCorrespondent in whose Veracity & Judgment I have before told you I\r\nplace a Confidence, has affirmd to me, that he knows his Sufferings for\r\nour glorious Cause. Has not Mc Neil struck upon this Rock? It is\r\npossible he has. Says my friendly Correspondent \"We all know his Zeal &\r\nSufferings for our glorious Cause.\" Such a Character commands my\r\nFriendship; but it has no Consideration in the present Appeal. Has he\r\nhad a fair Trial? I pay a proper Regard to the Decisions of a Court\r\nmartial, & shall not give my Vote for altering them in any Instance but\r\nwhen Error Fraud or partiality shall appear plainly to my own\r\nSatisfaction.\r\n\r\nOur Navy officers must not expect to pick & chuse for themselves. They\r\nought to be content with the Appointments given to them. It is true\r\nAppointments should be made with more Discretion than I think they can\r\nbe by any Men at three or four hundred Miles Distance. For this Reason\r\nI moved that they should be made by the Navy Board, which obtaind in a\r\ncertain Degree as you have seen or will see by a Letter from the Marine\r\nCommittee. Had this been the Case before Olney would have remaind in\r\nthe , Resistance & Bush must have waited for another. If the Queen of\r\nFrance is a better Vessel it will turn out not to the Disadvantage of\r\nOlney. While we have more officers in Commission than Ships, there must\r\nbe Disappointments, Envy, & Suspicions (oftentimes unreasonable) of\r\neach other. This is the Make of Man, and we may as well think of\r\nstopping the Tide as altering it. The Appointment of Landais affords an\r\nample Subject for the Observations of Speculatists and the Resentment\r\nof Navy officers. I think he is, as you observe an ingenuous & well\r\nbehaved Man, and if he is an able & experiencd officer, as we are\r\nassured he is by those whose Duty it is to give us the best\r\nIntelligence, it is a pity that two very good Lieutenants shd have the\r\nShip & the Service on that account. I hope others may be found to fill\r\ntheir places. \"It is an opinion that I was Landais' chief Patron.\" On\r\nthis occasion you discover your self, as you are disposd to do on every\r\noccasion, partial in my favor. If I was in any Degree instrumental in\r\npromoting Capt Landais, it was because I really thought he would be of\r\neminent Use to our Navy. And I question whether it would not have been\r\nthought a well judgd Appointment, if there had not been a fanciful\r\nPredilection in favor of Another. Even the Name of the Ship may have\r\ngiven Disgust to some Men. I hope when Manly is provided with such a\r\nShip as will please him the Difficulties or Obstructions in the Way of\r\ngetting the Alliance manned will be removd. I am very sure your\r\nExertions will not be wanting to promote the Service.\r\n\r\nAdieu,\r\n\r\n1 Recently of the Ship Hancock. The record of his court martial was\r\nlaid before the Continental Congress on August 5, and ordered to be\r\nreferred to the Marine Committee for filing among its papers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES WARREN.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADA July 1778\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR/\r\n\r\nIt is but seldom I can find Leisure to write a long Letter. You must\r\nexcuse me if I give you my Thoughts as I am able to recollect and\r\nadjust them into any Order. I find -------- to be an excellent Member of Congress.\r\nHe is a thorough and zealous Republican, and an able Supporter of the\r\npublick Liberty. I am satisfied it would be for the great Benefit of\r\nour Country, if you and he were to form an intimate Connection with\r\neach other. This I am very desirous of, because I have no Idea of your\r\nbeing long secluded from the publick Councils. He will go home shortly.\r\n\r\nI have not yet answerd your Letters of the 26th and 28th of June. I am\r\nin Pain about the Ship in your Harbour. Her Owners neglect to put her\r\ninto Repair, and I fear a great Number of her Officers and Crew for\r\nWant of Skill or Experience will be at a LOSS what to do with her if\r\nshe meets with a Storm. What a Pity is it, that an honest old Pilot has\r\nlately been dischargd, who used to steer successfully through Rocks &\r\nQuick sands! And that he should suffer this hard Usage, only because,\r\nunknown to him one who was a hearty Well wisher to the Voyage, and was\r\nanxious that Capacity & Merit might always govern Promotions, had\r\nventurd to declare him the fittest Man to take the Command. Ambition,\r\nor rather Vanity, and Avarice--an insatiable Thirst for Places and\r\nPreferment, without Ability or Intention to fulfil the Duties of them,\r\ntends to the Ruin of any Country, and if not eradicated, will soon\r\neffect it. It would be the Glory of this Age, to find Men having no\r\nruling Passion but the Love of their Country, and ready to render her\r\nthe most arduous and important Services with the Hope of no other\r\nReward in this Life than the Esteem of their virtuous Fellow Citizens.\r\nBut this, some tell us, is expecting more than it is in the Power of\r\nhuman Nature to give. Be it as it may. There are some Men to whom the\r\npublick Confidence most certainly ought to be refused. I mean those who\r\nin perilous Times have never dared to avow the publick Sentiments.\r\n\r\nLast Saturday1 Congress recd another Letter from the British\r\nCommissioners. You have it inclosd with a short Resolution2 in\r\nConsequence of it. This shuts the Door until they will be pleased to\r\nopen it. Governor Johnstone has acted so base a part as to hint the\r\noffer of Bribes not only to the President but every other Member of\r\nCongress, as you will see by the Inclosd Letter to Mr R. Morris. By\r\nthis he has in my opinion forfeited the Character of an honest Man &\r\njustly exposd himself to Contempt. I hope some Strictures will be made\r\nin the Newspapers on this as well as the disrespectful & even insolent\r\nLanguage in the Commissioners Letter, not so proper to be noticed by\r\nCongress. I am assured that a Bribe of 10,000 Guineas has been offerd\r\nto a Gentleman of Station & Character here. He refusd it as you might\r\nsuppose with suitable Resentment, telling the Lady who negociated this\r\ndirty Business, that the British King was not rich enough to purchase\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nMr D3 of whom I may perhaps hereafter have much to say to you is arrivd\r\nwith the Sieur Gerard. I have long ago formed my opinion of the\r\nAmerican Commissioner & have not yet alterd it. That of the french\r\nMinister is, a sensible prudent Man, not wanting in political Finesse &\r\ntherefore not to be listned to too implicitly. The french Squadron lies\r\noff Sandy Hook. I have inclosd the Names & Rates of the ships together\r\nwith the Spanish Ships in N York as deliverd to us by a Prisoner lately\r\nescaped from thence. Their Force bears no proportion to each other. The\r\nQuestion in my Mind is whether the french Admiral will risque his large\r\nShips to be workd, as they must be in an Engagement, in the Narrows --the\r\nWidth of the Channel is and its Depth at low Water. I am told that this\r\nis a favorite Expedition of Count d'Estaing himself, proposd by him &\r\nnot Mr D, to the french Court, and that his Reputation as a Politician\r\nas well as an Admiral is at Stake. From the Character I have recd of\r\nhim, I make no Doubt he will answer the highest reasonable Expectations\r\nof the King his Master and of America. Mr Ds political Friends, some of\r\nwhom I suppose are in Boston, are disposd to give him great Eclat on\r\nAccount of the Aid afforded us in sending this Squadron. His interest\r\nwith the french Ministry is represented as very forceable in procuring\r\nit and the Newspapers mention the favors conferd on him even by the\r\nKing himself. The Truth as I conceive it is, the total overthrow of\r\nBurgoyns Army was an Event which it was thought would produce Overtures\r\nfrom Britain, and France was apprehensive of our listening to Terms &\r\ncompromising Matters. Hence it was, more than from any other Cause or\r\nthe Interest of any Individual that a Treaty was facilitated & agreed\r\nto and to secure us in their Alliance & support us in sending this\r\nSquadron, and the Purpose of M Gerards Mission. We are informd that\r\nEleven Sail of Merchantmen & a Frigate have fallen into his Hands.\r\n\r\nI have declind answering your Letter of the 26 of June till I could\r\nassure you that the Sum you wishd for was granted for the Use of your\r\nDepartment. I now have the Pleasure of informing you that it will be\r\norderd as soon as it arrives from York Town. It is every hour expected.\r\nThe Marine Committee have agreed that the Navy Board shall appoint\r\nCommanders for Vessels of War under Twenty Guns.\r\n\r\n1 July 18; the letter was dated July 11.\r\n\r\n2 \"That no answer be given to the letter of the nth instant from the\r\nBritish commissioners.\"\r\n\r\n3 Silas Deane; Congress on July 11 was notified by him of his arrival\r\non the Languedoc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SAMUEL PHILLIPS SAVAGE.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILAD Augt 11 -78\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND\r\n\r\nI yesterday had the pleasure of receiving your favor by the post,\r\ncovering the News papers and a Letter, as you emphatically express it,\r\n\"from one of my closest Friends\"; for all which I thank you most\r\nheartily.\r\n\r\nYou ask me what occasiond the very sudden return of Mr H.----1. I answer in\r\nhis own Word to me, His own Want of Health & the dangerous Illness of\r\nhis Lady. You say he arrivd quite unexpected--you must surely be mistaken;\r\nfor he publickly said he had Leave of Absence from his Constituents.\r\nYou add, various are the Conjectures for the true Cause. It is the Lot\r\nof a great Man to have every Movement he makes critically scanned, and\r\nthe strangest Constructions are oftentimes put upon those parts of his\r\nConduct which may be most easily explaind. You have so many Twistings\r\nin your Typography and my Eyes are grown so dim with Age that I cannot\r\nwell discover whether you inform me that his Friends say the Air or\r\nAirs of Philadelphia doth not suit him; though I must conclude the\r\nformer from your usual Correctness in Grammar, for there is an evident\r\nfalse Concord in admitting the latter. Pray let me know whether the\r\nNews Papers have not done him Injustice in announcing that he made his\r\nEntrance into Boston on Sunday. I should think they had; for a well\r\nbred Man will carefully avoid counteracting the vulgar Prejudices or\r\ninjuring the Feelings of the People where he may happen to be.\r\n\r\nI congratulate you on the present happy Appearance of our publick\r\nAffairs, & joyn with you in Praying that Heaven may still prosper them.\r\n\r\nI shall take it as a favor if you will deliver the inclosd Manuscript,\r\nwithout suffering a Copy to be taken, to Mrs A. I told her, I would\r\nsend it to her as being not an unfit Subject for female Inspection &\r\nCriticism.\r\n\r\nI am very affectionately,\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\n1 Hancock; cf. page 41.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PETER THACHER.1\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILAD Augt 11 -78\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nI am quite ashamd that I have not yet acknowledgd the two Letters which\r\nI have had the Pleasure of receiving from you since I left Boston; you\r\nwill excuse me when I tell you, I have many Letters, which are daily\r\naccumulating, unanswerd, and very little Leisure. This by the Way, must\r\nconvince you how unfit a Person I am even if I were otherwise\r\nqualified, to undertake the important Task you require of me in your\r\nlast. While I am giving you the true Reason of my Silence, I hope it\r\nwill not prevent your writing to me by every opportunity. Herein you\r\nwill lay me under great obligations.\r\n\r\nBy the late Publications, you have seen, and doubtless have made your\r\nown Comments on the epistolary Correspondence between the British\r\nCommissioners & Congress. The short Resolution on their last Letter,\r\nhas put an End to it. Last Week the Minister from France had an\r\nAudience in Congress. The Manner of conducting this Ceremony, together\r\nwith a Letter from his most Christian Majesty and the Speeches of the\r\nMinister and the President are publishd in the inclosd News Paper. I\r\nhave had several opportunitys of seeing him at his own House, and a few\r\ndays ago he made a Visit to the Delegates of the Massachusetts who live\r\ntogether. He is easy and polite in his Manners and converses freely\r\nwithout much Ceremony.\r\n\r\nNothing can equal the barefaced Falshood of the Quakers & Tories in\r\nthis City, unless perhaps their Folly, in giving out that M. Gerard\r\ndoes not come in the Character of a publick Minister, but only to\r\nobtain Pay for the Stores we have receivd from that Country. These\r\nQuakers are in general a sly artful People, not altogether destitute,\r\nas I conceive, of worldly Views in their religious Profession. They\r\ncarefully educate their Children in their own contracted Opinions and\r\nManners, and I dare say they have in their Hearts as perfect a System\r\nof Uniformity of Worship in their Way, and are busily employd about\r\nspiritual Domination as ever Laud himself was, but having upon\r\nprofessed Principles renouncd the Use of the carnal Weapon, they cannot\r\nconsistently practice the too common Method made use of in former\r\ntimes, of dragooning Men into sound Beliefe. One might submit to their\r\nown inward Feelings, whether they do not now & then secretly wish for\r\nfire from Heaven in support of their Cause, in order to bring them upon\r\na footing with. those whose Consciences dictate the kindling fires on\r\nEarth for the pious Purpose of convincing Gainsayers, and who keep the\r\nSword in their Hands to enforce it. He who in the Spirit of the Apostle\r\nprofesses to wish Peace to all those who love the Lord Jesus Christ in\r\nSincerity, must discover an unmortified Pride & a Want of Christian\r\nCharity to destroy the peace of others who profess to have that sincere\r\nAffection to the Common Master, because they differ from him in Matters\r\nof mere opinion. But the Post is just going. I must therefore conclude\r\nwith assuring you that I am affectionately,\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\n1 A clergyman, of Maiden, Mass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES WARREN.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILAD Sept 1 -78\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nAfter having been disappointed several Weeks I am at length favord with\r\nyour very acceptable Letter of the 18 of August. You have formerly\r\nhinted to me your Apprehension that I mt think your Letters came to me\r\ntoo frequently. I could not then suppose you to be in Earnest; but your\r\nSilence from the 17 July to the Date of your last, which you own to be\r\nmany Days, is a very serious Comment, & obliges me in a formal Manner\r\nto assure you, that you cannot gratify me more than by writing to me\r\noften.\r\n\r\nMy Enemies in Boston are exceedingly mistaken if they think I have\r\ncondescended to become a Party Man in their unimportant Disputes about\r\nManly & Mc Neil,1 Neither of whom, in my opinion have derived any Honor\r\nfrom the Decisions of the late Courts martial. I wonder how Manly can\r\nattribute his Disappointment to me. At my Request he called to see me.\r\nI found him to be one of those Men who stand in Need of Advice & gave\r\nhim the best I could. I told him what Questions would probably be asked\r\nhim that he might prepare to answer them. In short I said every thing\r\nto him as a Friend which was proper for me to say. Perhaps I was too\r\ncandid to be thought a Friend. I intended to have been present at the\r\nCommittee, but was unavoidably hinderd. He did not call on me a second\r\ntime. Mc Neil is still here. He has called on me twice or thrice. I\r\nknow not in what part of the City he lives. His Friends & his Enemies\r\nmay be assured that I will give my Voice on the Subject Matter of his\r\nPetition according to my best Skill & Judgment. In this I expect to be\r\njustified by those to whose good opinion alone I pay the least Regard--the\r\ncandid & impartial.\r\n\r\nI heartily despise those small Dealers in Politicks who are propagating\r\nidle Stories to injure me. Little Insects will be for ever playing\r\nabout the glimmering Light of a farthing Candle. It is out of their\r\nPower to disturb the peace of my Mind. You took too much Pains, my dear\r\nFriend, to stop their Clamor, when you read a Paragraph in my Letter\r\nwhich was designd for your Perusal & not theirs. I am however obligd to\r\nyou for your kind Intention.\r\n\r\nYour Letter informs me that Mr H is gone on the Expedition to Rhode\r\nIsland.2 This is also announcd in the Boston News papers, which, to do\r\nthem Justice I must observe, never fail to notice all the Movements of\r\na Great Man. I am anxious to know the Event of this Expedition. But I\r\nam called off & must leave you abruptly. Adieu. I must write you again\r\nvery soon.\r\n\r\nBe so good as to let Mrs know that I am well.\r\n\r\n1 Cf. pages, 41, 57, 59, 63.\r\n\r\n2 See page 60.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES BOWDOIN.\r\n\r\n[Collections of Massachusetts Historical Society, 6th ser., vol. ix.,\r\npp. 423-425.]\r\n\r\n[PHILADELPHIA, Septr 3, 1778.]\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--A few days ago I received a letter from your son in law Mr\r\nTemple dated New York, August 23d, requesting me by the first\r\nopportunity to inform you of his & Mrs Temple's arrival there, & that,\r\nfor particular reasons he should be exceedingly happy if your affairs\r\nwould permit you to meet them at Philadelphia, or as near it as might\r\nbe convenient to you. He requested this of me, because excepting that\r\nletter & another to Mr President Laurens, he had not written a line\r\nsince his arrival at N. Y., & he had still weighty reasons for\r\ndeclining it. He also desired me to cause it to be made as convenient\r\nas might be (at his expence) for Mrs Temple & her little boy, who had\r\nnot been well since their arrival, to get to Philadelphia. His baggage\r\nwhich is both heavy & bulkey, he intended to get transported in a Flag,\r\nif any should be suffered to pass, to Boston, or some port as near it\r\nas might be, & hoped to see me soon in this city. His letter to the\r\nPresident was read in Congress. It was short and contained little more\r\nthan to sollicit leave to come to Philada to pay his respects to\r\nCongress. This was refus'd upon the idea that he might be a secret\r\nemissary from the British Court. I think it is best for him that his\r\nrequest is not granted; for the jealousy of the people at large would,\r\nI believe, render his residence here very uncomfortable. A certain\r\nDoctor Burkenhout, who came from London in the same packett with Mr T----, is\r\nnow in prison in this city, committed by the authority of this State,\r\nunder the same suspicion. I took occasion to inform Congress from my\r\nown knowledge of Mr Temple, that although he had been formerly an\r\nofficer of the Crown of Great Britain, and in the Customs,1 yet he had\r\nconstantly given great offence to his brother Commissioners & other\r\nfriends of that government, particularly Bernard & Hutchinson, by his\r\nattachment to those who espoused the liberties of America; that he went\r\nto England seven years ago, where, I understood, he had since lived the\r\ngreater part of the time, entirely out of favor at Court & in private\r\nlife. and that I had reason to think his connexions in Boston had long\r\nexpected his return to spend his days there. Congress afterwards\r\nordered the Secretary to inform Mr Temple, that if it was his intention\r\nto reside in any one of the United States, the same should be signified\r\nby him to the State in which he intends to reside, & the approbation of\r\nthat State\r\n\r\nobtaind before a passport could be granted to him. Thus the matter\r\nstands in all its particulars, a view of which I thought it proper you\r\nshould be acquainted with. I wish Mr Temple had turned his attention\r\nfirst to Boston. It is probable he will now do it, and that you will\r\nreceive a letter from him.\r\n\r\nI am with the greatest sincerity,\r\n\r\nYour affectionate friend, and humble servant,\r\n\r\n1 Cf.

When you tell me \"the Doctor thinks she is on the mending\r\nHand,\" and \"he hopes she will be cleverly in a Day or two,\" I am apt to\r\nconclude her Disorder had not much abated when you wrote. I know \"she\r\nis exceedingly 10th to give me the least Pain,\" and therefore I suspect\r\nshe has dictated to you to make the best of it to me. \"She begs of me\r\nnot to make myself very anxious for her.\" This is a Request which it is\r\nimpossible for me to comply with. I shall be very uneasy till I hear\r\nagain from you. I pray God she may recover her Health and long continue\r\na rich Blessing to you and me. I am satisfied \"you do all that lies in\r\nyour Power for so excellent a Mother.\" You are under great Obligations\r\nto her, and I am sure you are of a grateful Disposition. I hope her\r\nLife will be spared and that you will have the Opportunity of\r\npresenting to her my warmest Respects.

That He may reward\r\nyour filial Piety is the ardent Prayer of\r\n\r\nYour very affectionate Father,\r\n\r\n1 Later the wife of Thomas Wells.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN BRADFORD.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADE Sept 8th 1778\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nI have lately had the pleasure of receiving two Letters from you, one\r\nby Capt Manly and the other by yesterdays Post. The latter makes\r\nmention of some Notice you had receivd \"from a warm Friend to you & me\"\r\nthat \"Cap Mc Niel was making Misrepresentations at Philade to your\r\nDisadvantage.\" I have a particular Reason for my Curiosity in wishing\r\nto know who this Friend is. If I had that Knowledge I might perhaps see\r\nGrounds of Suspicion that the Design was far different from that of\r\ngiving you a friendly Hint. I assure you I have heard Nothing here to\r\nyour Disadvantage. If Capt McNiel is the Person I am to understand to\r\nbe your Enemy, I will tell you that he has called on me not more than\r\ntwice or thrice, since he arrivd here, and that he has not mentiond\r\nyour Name to me nor any thing relating to your Department, nor indeed\r\nany thing that would tend to bring you to my Thoughts. I know not in\r\nwhat Part of the City he lives. I suppose he is preparing to meet the\r\nMarine Committee to whom his Petition is referrd. When it may be proper\r\nfor me to give my Opinion, I intend to do it, with Freedom &\r\nImpartiality, not feeling my self interrested in the Party Disputes\r\nwhich I perceive there are in Boston between two Men, neither of whom\r\nin my opinion has derivd much Honor from the Decisions of the Courts\r\nMartial respecting them. If I shall hear any thing said to your\r\nPrejudice here you may depend on my letting you know it; being\r\ndetermind if possible to prevent your suffering an Injury which one of\r\nyour Friends at least thinks he has in being stabbd in the dark. I\r\nintend to write you more fully of these Matters at another Time. At\r\npresent I can only add a Request that you wd be so kind as to deliver\r\nthe inclosd Letter to my Daughter and forward the other which is from\r\nmy Servant to his Friends in Milton. My dear Mrs A, I am informd is\r\nvery unwell.\r\n\r\nI am with the most friendly Regard to your Family,\r\n\r\nvery affectionately,\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\nTO JAMES WARREN.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.}\r\n\r\nPHILAD Sept 12 1778\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nYour obliging Letter of the 25 of Augt by the Post came duly to my\r\nhand. As you again mention Cap Manly, I will speak of him to you with\r\nCandor. I never saw him but once, viz last Spring in Boston, till he\r\ncame to this City. I had preconceivd an opinion of his Bravery, in\r\nspeaking of which you tell me \"no Caution ought to be used,\" though I\r\nhave never yet been pointed to a single Instance of it. I confess his\r\nAppearance in Boston did not strike me most agreably. He was in the\r\nMidst of a Crowd, who were shouting his Entrance into the Town; and\r\nlike some of his Superiors, he seemd to be intoxicated with popular\r\nApplause. I had other Apprehensions, but I give you my most charitable\r\nThoughts. I retaind however an opinion of him; for I concluded, that\r\nHuzza for the brave M, would be a sufficient Inducement to him to lay a\r\nPop Gun Schooner alongside the Eagle, if good Fortune should throw her\r\nin his Way. You think \"his Judgment and Abilities would not be equal to\r\nothers in the Direction of more Ships than one.\" Here lies the\r\nDifficulty. Consider his Rank in our little Navy & judge how soon the\r\nTime may perhaps must come when he may have the Command of more Ships,\r\nif you give him the Command of one. Having said this to you & to no one\r\nelse, though I have heard the same thing mentiond by others, you will\r\nnot conclude that I am here deeply engagd in a Party against him. Some\r\nI know will, or will pretend to form this Conclusion, not from real\r\nRegard to the Merit of M., the Honor of our Navy or the great Cause we\r\nare engagd in, but from a different Motive and very inferior to either.\r\n\r\nI am glad that Landais \"rises in your Esteem\"-- that \"other Captains are\r\nconvincd he is Master of his Business which with his agreable Manners &\r\nDisposition forcd Conviction of the Judiciousness of his Appointment.\"\r\nI fancy now that I shall soon be dischargd the shameful Imputation of\r\nhaving been \"his chiefe Patron here.\" I have a particular Reason now to\r\nurge that every possible Exertion may be made to get his and all the\r\nother Ships manned. Last Evening a Letter from Governor Trumbull was\r\nread in the Committee, strongly recommending a Captain for the Ships at\r\nNorwich, who, added to great Qualifications, can readily get Men for\r\nher. I mentioned Manly as having the Character of a brave and very\r\npopular officer, and read those Parts of your last Letter to me which\r\nrelated to him. I am convincd that he need not impute his being\r\noverlookd to any other Cause than the Decree of the Court Martial which\r\nacquitted him with Honor.\r\n\r\nThe Rhode Island Expedition is at Length finishd. Our Cause is not\r\ndishonord though we did not succeed to our Wishes. Congress has approvd\r\nthe Retreat--thankd Genl Sullivan & his brave Troops and applauded the\r\npatriotick Exertions of New England. Major Genl Hancock was unluckily\r\nat Boston & missed the Laurel! In my opinion it is in a great Degree\r\nimpolitick at this Juncture to suffer an Odium to be cast on the Count\r\nD'Estaing. If there should be a Disposition to do it I am perswaded Men\r\nof Discretion & Influence will check it. The Tories will try their\r\nutmost to discredit our new Alliance. And he who not long ago expressd\r\nhis Opinion that \"a Connection with France will ruin America\" will not\r\nfail to promote a Jealousy if he can thereby establish his Popularity.\r\nSuch a Man should be critically watchd on this Occasion. Adieu my\r\nFriend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SAMUEL PHILLIPS SAVAGE.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library; a portion of the text is\r\nprinted in W. V. Wells, Life of Samuel Adams, vol. iii., p. 40.]\r\n\r\nPHILE Sept 14--78\r\n\r\nDR SR\r\n\r\nI recd your favor of the 3d with the News papers inclosd. I note well\r\nthe Contents. Our Boston Papers never fail to mark all the Movements of\r\nGreat Men & to give Honor where Honor is due. The spirited Exertions of\r\nour Major Generals to be sure ought properly to be noticed. Some of\r\nthem have had the good Fortune never to be out of the Way of making a\r\nFigure, while others are wisely following the unpopular Steps of Fabius\r\nor Count Daun. The Marquis La Fayette every one acknowledges, made\r\nsurprizing Dispatch in going to Boston and returning to R I; but he was\r\nsadly mortified in not being present in the Action on that Island. He\r\ndid all that Man cd do Impossibilities are not to be expected. But he\r\narrivd in Season to take a distinguishd Share in the well timed & well\r\nconducted Retreat. In Him we indeed see an Instance of a young Nobleman\r\n\"of Rank & fortune foregoing the pleasures of Enjoyment of domestick\r\nLife and exposing himself to the Hardships and Dangers of a Camp,\" not\r\nin his own but a foreign Country, \"in the glorious Cause of freedom.\"\r\n\r\nCongress requested the President to write to him & in their Name\r\nacknowledge his Zeal & spirited Services on this Occasion by which he\r\nhas given a fresh proof of his Attachment to our Common Cause. I am\r\nsorry to hear there is a Disposition in some persons in Boston to cast\r\nan odium on the french Admiral for his leaving Rhode Island. In my\r\nOpinion it is at this Juncture impolitick in the Extreme. Even if his\r\nConduct was thought to be blameworthy Prudence I think would dictate\r\nSilence to us. Men of Discretion and Influence will surely by all means\r\ncheck such a Disposition.\r\n\r\nThe Tories will try their utmost to discredit our new Alliance. You\r\nknow how much depends upon our cultivating mutual Confidence. It is not\r\nin the Power of undisguisd Tories to hurt our Cause. Injudicious tho\r\nhonest Whigs may & too often do injure it. Those whose chief aim is to\r\nestablish a Popularity in order to obtain the Emoluments of places or\r\nthe Breath of Applause will think they may serve themselves by\r\ndeclaiming on this Subject, or prompting others to do it; and they will\r\nnot fail doing it though they essentially wound their Country.\r\n\r\nIf there be any of my virtuous & publick spirited fellow Citizens who\r\npay the least Regard to my opinions I wish they would particularly\r\nregard what I say on this Occasion.\r\n\r\nI have written in haste and must break off abruptly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ----------.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADE Sept 21, 1778\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR/\r\n\r\nI beg you not to impute my omitting hitherto to acknowledge your Favor\r\nof the 4th of July to Negligence. I have frequently thought of its\r\nContents; and although I was not able to obtain what you wishd for, I\r\nthink you will not doubt my Sincerity when I assure you that whenever\r\nit shall be in my Power to render you substantial Service I shall do it\r\nwith the utmost Cheerfulness. It is the Opinion of Gentlemen here that\r\nthe Appointments of Auctioneers to make Sale of such Prize goods as\r\nfall to the Share of the Continent should be made by the Authority of\r\nthe particular States where such Goods may be forfeited.\r\n\r\nYour Letter was deliverd to me by Capt Manly. I am informd by some of\r\nmy Boston Friends that he speaks of me with a Degree of Bitterness,\r\nsupposing that I prevented his having another Ship. This gives me not\r\nthe least Disquietude. He may have been taught to believe it, by\r\nPersons who care but little for him and less for the Honor of our Navy\r\nor the great Cause we are contending for. Neither he nor his Friends\r\ncould be at a loss for the true Cause of his Disappointment, if they\r\nwould advert to the Judgment of the Court Martial which acquitted him\r\nwith Honor. What a strange Inconsistency was there in that Court, in\r\nrecommending Cap Manly for another Ship, and at the same Time holding\r\nup so great a Deficiency in his Conduct as the neglecting to prepare\r\nSignals for a Fleet under his Direction, and in general his Want of\r\nExperience. This was said by many; and it ought to be satisfactory to\r\nCap Manly, that though I clearly saw the Justice of the Remark, I was\r\nsilent. In this, it is possible, I was not altogether blameless. I have\r\nnever felt my self disposd to take a Side in the Disputes which I\r\nunderstand have run high between Partizans of Manly & McNiel. I think\r\nNeither of them can derive much Honor from the Decisions of their\r\nrespective Courts Martial. I wish for the Credit of our Country that\r\nboth had behavd more to the Satisfaction of the Publick. One of them is\r\nstill here. I suppose he is preparing to meet the Committee to whom his\r\nPetition is referrd. When it may be proper for me to speak my Mind his\r\nFriends & his Enemies may be assured I shall do it with Candor &\r\nFreedom. In doing this I expect to be justified, by sensible & honest\r\nMen. If I stand fair with them, you well know, how unsolicitous I am\r\nwhether others are pleasd or not.\r\n\r\nThere is another Matter of greater Consequence which I wish to mention\r\nto you. I am informd there are Persons in Boston disposd to make a\r\npopular Clamor against the french Admiral for leaving Rhode Island. I\r\ncannot help remonstrating to my Friends against it as in a great Degree\r\nimpolitick. Even if it should be thought he had taken a wrong step, it\r\nis our Wisdom at this Juncture to forbear criminating him. The Tories\r\nwill try their utmost to discredit our new Alliance. They cannot\r\nsucceed but by making injudicious Whigs their Instruments. There are\r\ntwo things from which I am more apprehensive than I am from the joynt\r\nEfforts of all our Enemies, viz the intemperate and misplacd Zeal of\r\nour honest Friends, and an insatiable Desire in others who are called\r\nFriends to establish a Popularity in order to obtain the Splendor or\r\nEmoluments of Places, or that vanity of vanities the Breath of Applause.\r\n\r\nAdieu my Friend,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADE Sept 28 1778\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BETSY\r\n\r\nYour Letter of the 16th which I just now receivd, is like cool Water to\r\na thirsty Soul. It gives me inexpressible Pleasure to have it under\r\nyour own Hand, that you are in the Way of Recovery from a dangerous\r\nDisorder. I earnestly pray God to restore you to perfect Health; and\r\nlet me intreat you, my Dear, to be very careful of your self.\r\n\r\nI exceedingly regret the LOSS which the Town has sustaind by the Death\r\nof Dr Eliot & Dr Greenleafe. In Times so degenerate as these are, it is\r\nmuch to be lamented that Men of such Exemplary Piety and Virtue are\r\ntaken away. I hope the Depravity of Manners is not so great as to\r\nexclude all Hopes of Childrens rising up and serving God and their\r\nCountry in the Room of their Fathers. May Heaven grant us a Time of\r\nReformation!\r\n\r\nI think you have done well in putting your Servant Boy Job an\r\nApprentice to a Sail Maker. I hope you will injoyn it on him to let you\r\nsee him often, that you may give him your Advice, and tell him it is my\r\nDesire that he would attend to it. I love the Boy, and am still of\r\nopinion, that if he is properly mannagd he will make a good Citizen.\r\n\r\nRemember me to my Daughter, Sister Polly and the rest of my Family &\r\nFriends, and accept of the best Wishes of\r\n\r\nyour most affectionate,\r\n\r\nWrite to me by every opportunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM COOPER.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADE Sept 30 1778\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nI have the pleasure of committing this Letter to the Care of your\r\nyoungest Son who having been unfortunately taken in the Brig\r\nResistance, was sufferd to come to this City to be exchangd for the\r\nPurser of the British Ship Mermaid who is now in N York on his Parole.\r\nThis Exchange I effected without Delay; and procured from the Navy\r\nBoard here an Advance of fifty Dollars, for which he is to account with\r\nthe Eastern Navy Board in the settlement of his Wages. I apprehended\r\nthis Sum would not be sufficient to discharge the Expence of his Board\r\nin this very expensive place & carry him through his Journey &\r\ntherefore I advancd him forty Dollars more, taking his Draft upon you\r\nwhich you will please to repay to Mrs Adams in Boston.\r\n\r\nI introducd your Son to your old Friend the President who receivd him\r\nwith great Courtesy. Upon my hinting to the President that if he had\r\npublick Letters to send to Boston, this young Gentleman would take good\r\nCare of them, and it would be the Means of providing him with an Horse\r\nfor his Journey, he very politely told me he should be glad [to] serve\r\nhim in that Way, He as well as Monsr Girard having Letters which mt be\r\nas well sent by him as by any other Person. I assure you it is not\r\nFlattery to tell you that I am exceedingly pleasd with your Son. His\r\nmodest Assurance is very engaging. If his Life is spared and his Morals\r\nwell fixed, I think he will make an excellent Citizen. That the\r\nChildren of N England may rise and serve God & their Country in the\r\nRoom of their Fathers is the most ardent Prayer of\r\n\r\nyour cordial Friend,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SAMUEL PHILLIPS SAVAGE.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADE Oct 6-78.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nI receivd your favor of the 23d of Septr by yesterdays Post. You tell\r\nme that Boston is become a new City, and explain your self by\r\nmentioning the exceeding Gayety of Appearance there. I would fain hope\r\nthis is confind to Strangers. Luxury & Extravagance are in my opinion\r\ntotally destructive of those Virtues which are necessary for the\r\nPreservation of the Liberty and Happiness of the People. Is it true\r\nthat the Review of the Boston Militia was closd with an expensive\r\nEntertainment? If it was, and the Example is followed by the Country, I\r\nhope I shall be excusd when I venture to pledge myself, that the\r\nMilitia of that State will never be put on such a Footing as to become\r\nformidable to its Enemies. I am told that such a Practice is contrary\r\nto the Letter of the Militia Act. I trust then I was misinformd when I\r\nwas told that it was countenanced by those who of all Men ought to pay\r\nthe most sacred Regard to the Law. Are we arrivd to such a Pitch of\r\nLevity & Dissipation as that the Idea of feasting shall extinguish\r\nevery Spark of publick Virtue, and frustrate the Design of the most\r\nnoble and useful Institution. I hope not. Shall we not again see that\r\nSobriety of Manners, that Temperance, Frugality, Fortitude and other\r\nmanly Virtues wch were once the Glory and Strength of my much lov'd\r\nnative Town. Heaven grant it speedily!\r\n\r\nAdieu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES WARREN.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILAD 11 Octobr 1778\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nIn the inclosd Newspaper you will see certain Queries calculated to\r\nimpress on the Minds of the people the Idea of Dr Lee's having held a\r\ncriminal Correspondence with a Person known to be at the same time in\r\nthe Service & under the Direction of the British Ministry. I hope it\r\nwill not be in the Power of this Querist to do essential Injury to so\r\neminent a Patriot; who took the earliest & most decisive Part in\r\nopposition to the Measures of the British Court, and whose invariable\r\nAttachment to the Liberties of our Country never was, and I think\r\ncannot be justly suspected. Yet it may be necessary to guard against\r\nit; for I plainly though silently saw when I was last in Boston a\r\nMalevolent Disposition towards Dr Lee, in a certain Gentleman, who,\r\ntill he is better known, will have a great Influence in the\r\nMassachusetts State. The Instance you may recollect, as you was knowing\r\nto it in the Time of it. I then supposd it to proceed from his having\r\nstrongly attachd himself, and for a Length of Time to a Circle of Men,\r\nand imbibd their Prejudices, who are far remote from the Connections of\r\nDr Lee, and who differ widely from them in the Adoption of publick\r\nMeasures regarding either Politicks or Morals.\r\n\r\nYou may remember that some time ago, in a Letter1 I informd you that I\r\nhad much to say to you about Mr D; of whom I had long formd my Opinion\r\n& had not seen Reason to alter it. I have hitherto said Nothing to you\r\nabout him; because I knew it would lead me to Subjects of great\r\nDelicacy, which, if exposd to the Enemy, as they would be if my Letter\r\nshould fall into their Hands, might disgrace, or otherwise be\r\nprejudicial to our publick Affairs. This Caution prevents my\r\ncommunicating to you many things of which I wish to unburthen my Mind.\r\n\r\nMr D was originally taken up by a secret Committee of Congress\r\nappointed to procure from France the necessary Supplys for carrying on\r\nthe War. By them he was sent to that Country in the Character of a mere\r\nMerchant. About that Time another Committee was; appointed, whose\r\nBusiness it was to form a Correspondence abroad, and particularly to\r\nfeel the political Pulse of France in Hopes of forming a Connection\r\nwith that powerful Nation. This Committee also took up Mr D; and he\r\ncarried Letters from Dr F to some Men of Eminence, which might enable\r\nhim in some Measure to penetrate into the Disposition of the Court of\r\nFrance towards America. With these Views Mr D was sent to France. He\r\nwas to be Agent to the secret Come of Commerce. To the secret Come of\r\nCorrespondence he was to be the Inquisitive Man or Intelligencer. He\r\nhad no political Powers whatever; and yet he sent us over, Majors,\r\nColonels, Brigadiers & Majors General in Abundance & more than we knew\r\nwhat to do with, of his own creating, till at length Mr Du Coudray\r\narrivd with the Commission (or an Agreement signd by Mr D in behalf of\r\nthe United States, that he should have one) of a Major General, with\r\nthe Command of our Artillery; together with his Suite of about 70\r\nGentlemen of different Ranks. All this was done, as I said before\r\nwithout any Authority. Congress was exceedingly embarrassd; being 10th\r\nto discredit their Commissioner (for before the Arrival of M Du Coudray\r\nhe was commissiond joyntly with Mess Franklin & Lee) I say being 10th\r\nto discredit him by disannulling the Convention, and at the same Time\r\njudging it dishonorable as well as unsafe for America to ratify it.\r\nThis however was agreed to in a Come of the whole House. Not having the\r\nrecords before me, I do not recollect whether it was confirmd in the\r\nHouse; but Du Coudray soon after died, his Suite or most of them\r\nreturnd with Gratifications & Mr D was recalled. After which he was\r\ndirected to return speedily and give an Accot of the State of our\r\nAffairs in Europe.\r\n\r\nThis has given an Occasion to his Friends to hide the true Reason of\r\nhis being recalled, & to hold up in the News Papers an ostensible one,\r\nsupposing it to be more for his Reputation.\r\n\r\nOur Affairs even in France wore a gloomy Aspect during the last year\r\nuntil the News of our Army at the Northward being completely\r\nvictorious. This was the decisive Language which commanded our Success\r\nin the Cabinet of France. To this we are indebted for the Acknowledgmt\r\nof our Independence, the Treaty and the french Fleet. Mr D is\r\ncomplimented with having procurd this Fleet, and his \"spirited\r\nExertions\" like those of other Great Men have been puffd off in the\r\nNews Papers. Unthinking Men may be amusd with a Golden Snuff Box &c.\r\nAfter all they are mere Things of Course, especially in the Honey Moon\r\nof National Matrimony.\r\n\r\nSince Mr Ds Return as well as before, there have been Suggestions of\r\nhis Misconduct in France; and among other things, of his Misapplication\r\nof publick Money. I cannot say whether these Suggestions are well\r\ngrounded or not. Congress is devoting every Hour to an Enquiry into the\r\nGrounds of them which can be spared from an Attention to other great\r\nAffairs, particularly the Finances. The Conduct of an honest Man will\r\nbear the strictest Scrutiny. If the Friends of Mr D have any Suspicions\r\nof his being tardy, I am inclind to think they will be more\r\napprehensive of a Detection from the Vigilance & Integrity of Dr Lee\r\nthan any thing else. On such occasions it is not unusual for the most\r\nunblemished of Characters & sometimes the Lives of the best of them to\r\nbe sacrificd in order to prevent \"Transactions dark & mysterious\" from\r\nbeing brot into open Light.\r\n\r\nI have written this Letter in Confidence & shall continue the Subject\r\nwhen I can find Leisure. Adieu.\r\n\r\n1 Cf. page 47.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES WARREN.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADE Oct 14 -- 78\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nIn my last I inclosd a News paper containing certain Queries\r\ncalculated, as I conceive, to blast the Reputation of a truly virtuous\r\nMan.\r\n\r\nI must inform you that Dr Lee & Dr Berkenhout, mentiond by the Querist,\r\nwere formerly fellow Students at Edinburgh; and as both were esteemed\r\nlearned in their Profession, it is not improbable that on that Account\r\nthey kept up their Acquaintance while both continued in Great Britain.\r\nDr Lee you know was requested by Congress to go over to France, where\r\nhe was made a joynt Commissioner with Messrs Franklin & Dean. It is\r\npossible that a Correspondence might afterwards have been carried on\r\nbetween them; but from the Knowledge I have of Dr Lee, I will venture\r\nto pledge my self it was not a criminal one, as the Querist would seem\r\nto insinuate, and if Dr Berkenhout was in the Service & under the\r\nDirection of the British Ministry, which by the Way is but base\r\nSuspicion here, it was utterly unknown to Dr Lee. It is doubtful\r\nwhether any Correspondence was held between these two Gentlemen. I am\r\nrather inclind to think it is a Creature of the Querists own Fancy, or\r\nan artful Suggestion thrown out to the Publick to serve the Cause of\r\nour Enemies. America shod beware how she suffers the Character of one\r\nof the most able & vigilant Supporters of her Rights to be injurd by\r\nQuestions designd to impute Slander, without any Reasons offerd why\r\nsuch Questions should be made. It is the old Game of mischievous Men to\r\nstrike at the Characters of the good and the great, in order to lessen\r\nthe Weight of their Example & Influence. Such Patriots as Lord Russell\r\n& Algernon Sydney of the last Age, have of late been falsly &\r\naudaciously chargd by a Scotch Tool of the most nefarious Court, with\r\nhaving receivd Bribes from the National Enemy; and it is not strange\r\nthat a Gentleman whom the leading Whigs of America have always placd so\r\nhigh in their List of Patriots, who has renderd the most laborious &\r\nimportant Services to our Country in England France & other Parts of\r\nEurope, who so often & so seasonably developd the secret Intrigues &\r\nPractices of wicked Men & who at this time stands high in the Esteem &\r\nConfidence of the Congress, & in addition to this, when it is considerd\r\nthat there are too many disaffected & insidious Men still lurking among\r\nus, it is by no Means a strange Thing that Dr Lee is also chargd with a\r\ncriminal Correspondence with the Enemy, without even the Shadow of\r\nReason.\r\n\r\nThe Post who has been retarded by violent Rains is just arrivd & brings\r\nme your obliging favr of 30 Sept. It contains very interesting Matters\r\nwhich shall have my Attention at a more leisure Hour than the present.\r\n\r\nAdieu,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JONATHAN TRUMBULL.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILAD Oct 16 -- 78\r\n\r\nSIR\r\n\r\nI had the Honor of receiving your Excys Letter of the 5th Instant,1 and\r\nsincerely condole with you on the heavy LOSS your Family and the\r\npublick sustain by the Death of your eldest Son.

And as it appears to be the Design of the Enemy, as far as it\r\nmay be in their power, further to pursue their barbarous practice of\r\nlaying waste our Sea Ports, and that they would be particularly\r\ngratified by an opportunity of destroying this City; would it not be\r\nproper that one or two of your Gallies should be ordered to watch for\r\nthem in the River, that they may seize their Vessel & bring the Men up,\r\nblindfold, to be confined & dealt with according to the Laws of Nature\r\nand Nations. You will excuse this Hint, and be assured that I am,\r\n\r\nYour very humble Servt,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES WARREN.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILAD Oct 17 1778\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nIf I was to tell you that I wonder much at the Conduct of some of our\r\nPoliticians it might discover my own Folly; for it is said a wise Man\r\nwonders at Nothing. Be it so. I am curious to know who made the Motion\r\nfor the Admission of Gray, Gardiner & Jemmy Anderson? Which of the\r\nB[oston] Members supported the Motion? Are the Galleries of the House\r\nopen? Do the People know that such a Motion was made? A Motion so\r\nalarming to an old Whig? Or are they so incessantly eager in the\r\nPursuit of Pleasure or of Gain as to be totally thoughtless of their\r\nCountry? I hope not. Gracious Heaven! Defend us from Vanity Folly & the\r\ninordinate Love of Money. Your News Papers are silent upon every\r\nSubject of Importance but the Description of a Feast, or the Eclat of\r\nsome Great Man. Your able Patriot is wholly employd in spirited\r\nExertions of the Military Kind, or surely he wd have pourd forth all\r\nhis Eloquence against so detestable a Motion.--\" The Motion did not\r\nobtain.\" I rejoyce in this; But Do you do Justice [to] the House by so\r\nfaint an Expression? I hope they rejected it with every Mark of\r\nContempt & Indignation. Do the Gentlemen who made & supported this\r\nMotion know, that even in this Quaker Country, they are trying &\r\ncondemning & I suppose will hang some of their considerable Men for\r\nCrimes not inferior to those of Gray & Gardiner. Jemmy Anderson I have\r\nforgot. I suppose he is a little Man & a Scotchman. It is the opinion\r\nof the People in this Country, that a Galloway could not atone for his\r\npublick Crimes with the Sacrifice of an hundred Lives. A Galloway, a\r\nGray, a Gardiner! Examine them & say which is the greatest Criminal.\r\nConfiscation you tell me labors--\"it labors very hard\"! I have heard\r\nobjections made to it, not in this Country, but in my own. But I\r\nthought those objections were made by interested Men. Shall those\r\nTraiters who first conspired the Ruin of our Liberties; Those who\r\nbasely forsook their Country in her Distress & sought Protection from\r\nthe Enemy when they thought them in the Plenitude of Power--who have been\r\never since stimulating & doing all in their Power to aid and comfort\r\nthem while they have been exerting their utmost to enslave & ruin us.\r\nShall these Wretches have their Estates reservd for them & restored at\r\nthe Conclusion of this glorious Struggle in which some of the richest\r\nBlood of America has been spilled, for the sake of a few who may have\r\nMoney in England & for this Reason have maintaind a dastardly and\r\ncriminal Neutrality? It cannot be. I venturd to speak my Mind in a\r\nPlace where I could claim no Right to speak. I spoke with Leave which I\r\nshould have disdaind to have done, had I not felt the Importance of the\r\nSubject to our Country. I will tell you my Opinion. If you do not act a\r\ndecisive Part--If you suffer those Traiters to return & enjoy their\r\nEstates, the World will say, you have no Sense of publick Injury & have\r\nlost your understanding.\r\n\r\nAdieu my dear Friend,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA Octob 20th -78\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BETSY\r\n\r\nA few days ago Mr Brown, a publick Messenger carried a Letter from me\r\nto you, which I hope you will receive before this reaches you. I feel a\r\nPleasure when I sit down to write to you and omit no opportunity. My\r\nBoston Friends tell me with great Solicitude that I have Enemies there.\r\nI thank them for their Concern for me, and tell them I knew it before.\r\nThe Man who acts an honest Part in publick Life, must often counteract\r\nthe Passions Inclinations or Humours of weak and wicked Men and this\r\nmust create him Enemies. I am therefore not disappointed or mortified.\r\nI flatter my self that no virtuous Man who knows me will or can be my\r\nEnemy; because I think he can have no Suspicion of my Integrity. But\r\nthey say my Enemies \"are plotting against me.\" Neither does this\r\ndiscompose me, for what else can I expect from such kind of Men. If\r\nthey mean to make me uneasy they miss their Aim; for I am happy and it\r\nis not in their Power to disturb my Peace. They add, The Design is to\r\nget me recalled from this Service. I am in no Pain about such an Event;\r\nfor I know there are many who can serve our Country here with greater\r\nCapacity (though none more honestly). The sooner therefore another is\r\nelected in my Room the better. I shall the sooner retire to the sweet\r\nEnjoyment of domestick Life. This, you can witness, I have often wishd\r\nfor; and I trust that all gracious Providence has spared your precious\r\nLife through a dangerous Illness, to heighten the Pleasures of my\r\nRetirement. If my Enemies are governd by Malice or Envy, I could not\r\nwish them a severer Punishment than their own Feelings. But, my Dear, I\r\nthank God, I have many Friends. You know them. Remember me to them all\r\nas you have opportunity. I could say many more things to you, but I am\r\ncalled off. My Love to my Daughter & Sister Polly and the rest of our\r\nFamily and Connections. Adieu. Your most affectionate,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Adams Papers, Quincy.]\r\n\r\nPHILADA Octob 25, 1778\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR/\r\n\r\nYour Favor of the 24th of May did not reach my hand till yesterday. The\r\nGentleman who brought it, Mr Archer, tells me he had a Passage of\r\nEleven Weeks. I will show him the Respect due to the Character you give\r\nhim, & properly regard such future Recommendations as may come from you.\r\n\r\nI suppose you have been fully & officially informd of the State of our\r\nmilitary Affairs since the Enemy evacuated this City and met with a\r\nDrubbing at Monmouth. And as publick Letters will doubtless be\r\nforwarded by this Conveyance, it is needless for me to give you a\r\nparticular Detail of what has happend since. By those Letters you will\r\nbe informd that Dr Franklin is appointed Minister Plenipotentiary at\r\nVersailes. It is not yet determind how you will be disposd of; but as\r\nCongress entertain great Expectations from your Services, you may\r\ndepend upon Employment being allotted for you somewhere. The critical\r\nSituation of the Powers of Europe in general, renders it somewhat\r\ndifficult for us to determine, to which of them to make our Addresses\r\nat present. Every Cabinet I suppose is busily engagd in making the\r\nnecessary Arrangements and preparing for the opening of a Campaign, if\r\nWar should take Place. In this Case, I should think France must be our\r\nPole Star, while it continues, and our Connections must be formd with\r\nhers. In the mean time however, Holland, whose Policy is always to be\r\nat Peace, may be open for a Negociation; and in my opinion, we ought to\r\ntake the earliest opportunity to tempt her.\r\n\r\nThe two main Armies at & near New York have been quiet since the Enemy\r\nretreated to that City. We have made another Expedition against Rhode\r\nIsland. Our Arms were not disgracd, though we did not succeed to our\r\nWishes. Genl S behavd as usual with Bravery; but some will have it that\r\nthere is a Mixture of Imprudence in every thing he does. He promisd\r\nhimself to share with Gates in the Glory of Victory, and as an officer\r\nof Spirit, no doubt he felt vexed with the Disappointment; but he was\r\ntoo sanguine in my Opinion when he expected that the Count D Estaing\r\nwould remain there, in the Circumstances which he was thrown into by a\r\nviolent Storm he met with when in Pursuit of Lord Howe. This unforeseen\r\n& unavoidable Accident left him too much inferior to the British\r\nSquadron to run the Risque with any Degree of Prudence. It was a\r\nMisfortune which we all regret, but must bear. Knowing the high Temper\r\nof the People of my native Town, I immediately upon hearing it, wrote\r\nto some of the principal Men to prevent Blame being cast on the Count\r\nfor leaving Rhode Island; a Disposition which I apprehended the artful\r\nTories (for such there are even there) would encourage with a View of\r\ndiscrediting our new and happy Alliance, in the Minds of injudicious\r\nWhigs. I am happy to be informd that the Count and his Officers, and\r\nindeed every french Gentleman is treated there with the highest Marks\r\nof Respect and Friendship.\r\n\r\nFor some Weeks past there have been Reports here that the Enemies\r\nTroops at N York were about to embark, as they gave out on a grand\r\nExpedition, and we are now assured that Sixteen Sail of the Line and\r\nabout one hundred and fifty Transports put to Sea on Tuesday the 20th\r\nInst. Various are the Conjectures of their Destination. Whether to\r\nBoston, South Carolina or the West Indies, a few Days will decide. The\r\nCount D Estaing has sufficiently securd his Ships in Case of an Attack\r\non them; and if they land their Troops with Intent to march them to\r\nBoston, it is my opinion they will repent of their Expedition. It\r\nappears to me most probable that the Troops are bound to the West\r\nIndies, and that the Ships of War, after having convoyd them to a\r\ncertain Latitude will return for the Protection of the Garrisons which\r\nI suppose are to be left at Newport and New York. The Enemy will be\r\n10th to quit the small Portion of Land they possess within the United\r\nStates, for though they must despair of subduing us by Arms, it will be\r\nnecessary for them to oblige us to continue the Expence of large Armies\r\nin order to nonplus us in the Art of financiering. This may be a Method\r\nof carrying on the Contest, the most puzzling to us; but I trust we\r\nshall disappoint them.\r\n\r\nThe Marquiss De la Fayette whose extraordinary Merit is fully known to\r\nyou, does me the Honor of taking the Care of this Letter, and will\r\ndeliver it to you.\r\n\r\nI am, my dear Sir, with the greatest Sincerity\r\n\r\nyour affectionate,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ARTHUR LEE.\r\n\r\n[MS., Lenox Library; a draft is in the Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox\r\nLibrary.]\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA Octob 26 -78\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nYour several Letters dated as in the Margin,1 with the Inclosures came\r\nto my Hand. And although I have not hitherto acknowledgd to you the\r\nReceipt of them, I assure you I have been and am still improving the\r\nIntelligence you have given me, to the best of my Power, for the\r\nAdvantage of this Country. From our former Correspondence you have\r\nknown my Sentiments. I have not alterd them in a single Point, either\r\nwith Regard to the great Cause we are engagd in or to you who have been\r\nan early, vigilant & active Supporter of it. While you honor me with\r\nyour confidential Letters, I feel and will freely express to you my\r\nObligation. To have answerd them severally would have led me to\r\nSubjects of great Delicacy, and the Miscarriage of my Letters might\r\nhave provd detrimental to our important Affairs. It was needless for me\r\nto run this Risque for the sake of writing; for I presume you have been\r\nmade fully acquainted with the State of our publick Affairs by the\r\nCommittee, and as I have constantly communicated to your Brother R. H.\r\nthe Contents of your Letters to me, it was sufficient on that Score,\r\nfor him only to write, for he thinks as I do.\r\n\r\nThe Marquiss De la Fayette, who does me the Honor to take this Letter,\r\nis this Moment going, which leaves me Time only to add that I am and\r\nwill be your Friend, because I know you love our Country and Mankind.\r\n\r\nI beg you to write to me by every Opportunity.\r\n\r\nAdieu my dear Sir,\r\n\r\n1 1777: July 31.

I rejoyce that you have recoverd your usual State of Health\r\nand that my Family enjoy that invalueable Blessing.\r\n\r\nIs it possible that M could make & propagate so barefaced a Story as\r\nyou mention? Are you not misinformd? I lose every Sentiment of Regard\r\nfor him as a Man of Truth. I have heard that my Enmity to G. W. was\r\nobjected agt me on a late Occasion. I did not wonder that those who\r\nbelievd it were displeasd with me. My very worthy Friend & colleague Mr\r\nD satisfied the Minds of those who meant well and explaind some things\r\nrelating to Mr ---- which were new & surprising to them. I console myself\r\nthat those who try to injure me (I must not call them Enemies) are\r\nobligd to fabricate malicious Falshoods for their purpose.\r\n\r\nTell my Friend M S. that I will answer his Letter the next post. In the\r\nmean time ask him whether a Christian is bound to confide in the Man\r\nwho has attempted seven times (though in vain) to ruin him.\r\n\r\nAdieu.\r\n\r\nMANIFESTO OF THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nOctober 30, 1778.\r\n\r\n[W. V. Wells, Life of Samuel Adams,1 vol. iii., pp. 46, 47.]\r\n\r\nThe United States having been driven to hostilities by the oppressive\r\nand tyrannous measures of Great Britain, having been compelled to\r\ncommit the essential rights of men to the decision of arms, and having\r\nbeen at length forced to shake off a yoke which had grown too\r\nburdensome to bear, they declared themselves free and independent.\r\n\r\nConfiding in the justice of their cause; confiding in Him who disposes\r\nof human events; although weak and unprovided, they set the power of\r\ntheir enemies at defiance.\r\n\r\nIn this confidence they have continued through the various fortunes of\r\nthree bloody campaigns, unawed by the power, unsubdued by the barbarity\r\nof their foes. Their virtuous citizens have borne without repining the\r\nloss of many things which make life desirable. Their brave troops have\r\npatiently endured the hardships and dangers of a situation fruitful in\r\nboth beyond former example.\r\n\r\nThe Congress, considering themselves bound to love their enemies as\r\nchildren of that Being who is equally the Father of all, and desirous,\r\nsince they could not prevent, at least to alleviate the calamities of\r\nwar, have studied to spare those who were in arms against them, and to\r\nlighten the chains of captivity.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of those serving under the King of Great Britain hath, with\r\nsome few exceptions, been diametrically opposite. They have laid waste\r\nthe open country, burned the defenceless villages, and butchered the\r\ncitizens of America.\r\n\r\nTheir prisons have been the slaughter-houses of her soldiers, their\r\nships of her seamen, and the severest injuries have been aggravated by\r\nthe grossest insults.\r\n\r\nFoiled in their vain attempts to subjugate the unconquerable spirit of\r\nfreedom, they have meanly assailed the representatives of America with\r\nbribes, with deceit, and the servility of adulation. They have made a\r\nmock of religion by impious appeals to God, whilst in the violation of\r\nHis sacred command. They have made a mock even of reason itself, by\r\nendeavoring to prove that the liberty and happiness of America could\r\nsafely be intrusted to those who have sold their own, unawed by the\r\nsense of virtue or of shame.\r\n\r\nTreated with the contempt which such conduct deserved, they have\r\napplied to individuals. They have solicited them to break the bonds of\r\nallegiance and imbue their souls with the blackest crimes. But fearing\r\nthat none could be found through these United States equal to the\r\nwickedness of their purpose, to influence weak minds they have\r\nthreatened more wide devastation.\r\n\r\nWhile the shadow of hope remained that our enemies could be taught by\r\nour example to respect those laws which are held sacred among civilized\r\nnations, and to comply with the dictates of a religion which they\r\npretend, in common with us, to believe and revere, they have been left\r\nto the influence of that religion and that example. But since their\r\nincorrigible dispositions cannot be touched by kindness and compassion,\r\nit becomes our duty by other means to vindicate the rights of humanity.\r\n\r\nWe, therefore, the Congress of the United States of America, do\r\nsolemnly declare and proclaim that if our enemies presume to execute\r\ntheir threats, or persist in their present career of barbarity, we will\r\ntake such exemplary vengeance as shall deter others from a like\r\nconduct. We appeal to the God who searcheth the hearts of men for the\r\nrectitude of our intentions; and in his holy presence declare that, as\r\nwe are not moved by any light or hasty suggestions of anger or revenge,\r\nso through every possible change of fortune we will adhere to this our\r\ndetermination.\r\n\r\nDone in Congress by unanimous consent, the thirtieth day of October,\r\none thousand seven hundred and seventy-eight.\r\n\r\n1 Also attributed to Adams by Niles, Principles and Acts, pp. 476, 477.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SAMUEL PHILLIPS SAVAGE.\r\n\r\n[W. V. Wells, Life of Samuel Adams, vol. iii., pp. 56, 57; a draft is\r\nin the Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA, Nov. 1, 1778.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,--\r\n\r\nI duly received your favor of October--by the last post, and should have\r\nimmediately answered it, had I not been that day exceedingly engaged. I\r\ndo not keep copies of all my letters,--they are trifles. You were mistaken\r\nin supposing that I ascribed the independence of America to New England\r\nonly. I never was so assuming as to think so. My words are, that\r\nAmerica is obliged to New England, and this is an acknowledged truth.\r\nIt is the opinion of others, as well as myself, that the principles and\r\nmanners of New England, from time to time, led to that great event. I\r\npray God she may ever maintain those principles which, in my opinion,\r\nare essentially necessary to support and perpetuate her liberty. You\r\nmay see my sentiments of the patriotism of other States in a letter I\r\nlately wrote to Mrs. Adams (if it is in being), in which I relate a\r\nconversation which passed between Monsieur -------- and myself. But enough of this.\r\nI love my country. My fears concerning her are that she will ruin\r\nherself by idolatry.\r\n\r\nA part of your letter, you tell me, is confidential. I always keep the\r\nsecrets of my friends when I can do it honestly, though I confess I do\r\nnot like to be encumbered with them. In this instance I will be your\r\nconfidant. But let me ask you, can a difference between Mr. -------- and me, either\r\nreal or imaginary, be of any consequence to the world? I think not.\r\nTories, you say, triumph. They may make sport of it; but indeed, my\r\nfriend, it is too unimportant a matter for a sensible Whig to weep and\r\nbreak his heart about. I am desirous of making you easy; and I do\r\nassure you that, so far from brooding in my heart an unfriendly\r\ndisposition towards that man, I seldom think of him, unless I happen to\r\ntake up a Boston newspaper or hear his name mentioned in chit-chat\r\nconversation. You call upon me by all that is sacred to forgive him. Do\r\nyou think he has injured me? If he has, should he not ask for\r\nforgiveness? No man ever found me inexorable. I do not wish him to ask\r\nme to forgive him; this would be too humiliating. If he is conscious of\r\nhaving done or designed me an injury, let him do so no more, and I will\r\npromise to forgive and forget him too; or, I would add, to do him all\r\nthe service in my power. But this is needless; it is not in my power to\r\nserve him. He is above it.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to know the foundation of this wonderful collision, ask my\r\nfriend J. W., or another, whom you properly call my closest friend. To\r\nthem I have related the trifling tale, and they can repeat it to you.\r\n\r\nThe precepts and examples you refer me to I shall always reverence most\r\nhighly.\r\n\r\nI am, with unfeigned sincerity,\r\n\r\nYour obliged and affectionate friend,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES WARREN.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADA Novr 3 1778\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nIn your last you ask me what we are doing? Many Things indeed. And if\r\nyou will suppose some things to be done well, I will frankly confess to\r\nyou that in my opinion others might have been done better. I think we\r\ndo as well as we can considering the Pile of Business every Morning\r\nlaid on our table. In order that the Affairs of the Treasury may be\r\nbetter attended than they possibly can be by Members of Congress who\r\nare obliged to give their Attendance in the House we have establishd a\r\nnew Board to consist of a Treasurer Comptroller Auditor & two Chambers\r\nof Accots of three each. These officers are all chosen from without\r\nDoors. We are taking Measures for the Appretiation of the Currency.\r\nEvery Adept in financiering is busily employd and I hope we shall\r\nbefore long agree in an effectual Plan. We have appointed Dr F.\r\nMinister Plenipo. at Versailes & written a Letter of Credence to our\r\ngood & great Ally. The Situation of the general Affairs of Europe\r\nrender it somewhat difficult to determine to which of the other Powers\r\nat present to make our Court. Every Cabinet will, I suppose, this\r\nwinter be deeply engagd in making Arrangements and preparing for the\r\nopening a Campaign in Case of a general War which it is more than\r\nprobable will happen. Our Friend A L is in Spain. Our other Friend J A\r\nwill be employd somewhere. France must be our Pole Star & our\r\nConnection must be formd with hers. Holland whose Policy is always to\r\nbe at Peace may be open to Negociation & the sooner we tempt her the\r\nbetter. Spain must joyn with France. But she is dilatory. I wish she\r\nwould recollect how much she was injured by it the last War, when she\r\nsufferd the common Enemy to beat France & her self in Detail. The\r\nSpirit of Chatham is indeed extinguishd in Britain. His decisive Mind\r\nmight have dictated the Seizure of their Float at Sea. Perhaps it is\r\nwell the Great Man is no more. The Millions are safely arrivd & the\r\nTone of Neutrality at Madrid is become languid. A formidable Fleet lies\r\nequip'd in Cadiz which operating with that of France at this Juncture\r\nmight give a fatal Blow to the boasted Sovereignty of Britain on the\r\nOcean. The Count D' Estaings Squadron I suppose will go to the West\r\nIndies. If so, must not the British follow with a great Part of their\r\nTroops, if they mean to keep Possession of their own Islands. They may\r\nleave Garrisons at N York & Newport, with a View of obliging us still\r\nto maintain a great Army, in hopes we shall be undone by Expences while\r\nthey despair of subduing us by the Power of their Army. We must have a\r\nrespectable Army in the Spring to put a good face on our Negociations\r\nor to fight. I hope we shall secure to the United States, Canada Nova\r\nScotia & the Fishery by our Arms or by Treaty. Florida too is a\r\ntempting object in the South. Perhaps if you should show this Letter to\r\nsome Folks, it may be thought to confirm an opinion from whence an\r\nobjection was drawn against me on a late occasion \"that I was averse to\r\nReconciliation.\" We shall never be on a solid Footing till G B cedes to\r\nus what Nature designs we sh[ould] have or we wrest it from her.\r\n\r\nThe Marine Committee have obtaind a Warrant for 150,000 Dollars for\r\nyour Department which will be forwarded speedily. Congress has increasd\r\nyour Salaries to 3000 Dollars p Annum. I had this in View when I\r\nintreated you in my last, not to resign your Seat. Nothing would\r\nreconcile me to this but your having one here. I am determind to make\r\nRoom for you by a Resignation next Spring. I flatter my self I can yet\r\nbe in some Degree useful to my Country in a narrow Sphere.

That all the People may with united Hearts on\r\nthat Day express a just Sense of His unmerited Favors:--Particularly in\r\nthat it hath pleased Him, by His over ruling Providence to support us\r\nin a just and necessary War for the Defence of our Rights and\r\nLiberties;--By affording us seasonable Supplys for our Armies--by disposing\r\nthe Heart of a powerful Monarch to enter into Alliance with us and aid\r\nour Cause--by defeating the Councils and evil Designs of our Enemies, and\r\ngiving us Victory over their Troops--and by the Continuance of that Union\r\namong these States, which by his Blessing, will be their future\r\nStrength & Glory.\r\n\r\nAnd it is further recommended, that together with devout Thanksgivings\r\nmay be joined a penitent Confession of our Sins, and humble\r\nSupplication for Pardon through the Merits of our Savior. So that under\r\nthe Smiles of Heaven, our publick Councils may be directed--our Arms by\r\nLand and Sea prosperd--our Liberty and Independence secur'd--our Schools &\r\nSeminaries of Learning flourish--our Trade be revivd--our Husbandry and\r\nManufactures increasd, and the Hearts of all impressd with undissembled\r\nPiety, with Benevolence, and Zeal for the publick Good.\r\n\r\nAnd it is also recommended that Recreations unsuitable to the Purpose\r\nof such a Solemnity may be on that Day--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SAMUEL PHILLIPS SAVAGE.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILAD Novr 10th 1778\r\n\r\nMY GOOD OLD FRIEND\r\n\r\nI am at present in great Haste; but as a Supplement to my last I will\r\nask you, Who among the Sons of America ought to enforce the Example of\r\nthe illustrious young Foreigner? Who is substituting other Means of\r\nDissipation in my native Town in Lieu of Theatrical Entertainments &c\r\n&c? Who has mixed the Grave and the Vain, the Whigs and the Tories in\r\nScenes of Amusement totally incompatible with the present serious\r\nTimes? Who among the Grave and Who among the Whigs, I mean such Whigs\r\nas have a feeling for their distressd Country and the Multitudes of\r\ndistressd Individuals in it, are present at such Entertainmts? Is there\r\na Man among them to whom our Country has entrusted her Independence,\r\nher Virtue, her Liberty? What can be the Views and Designs of such a\r\nMan, but to establish a Popularity by forming a Coalition of Parties\r\nand confounding the Distinction between Whigs and Tories, Virtue &\r\nVice? When I was last in Boston, I seizd an Opportunity to advise my\r\nFellow Citizens to beware of their popular Men--to penetrate their Views\r\nand Designs. There was comparatively no great Danger from a great Man\r\nset over them by the British Tyrant. When the People set up a Great Man\r\nof their own, their Jealousy is asleep, & they are in Danger of a\r\nMaster. I have no personal Prejudices or Attachments. Many things I\r\nhave to say to you if I had Leisure.\r\n\r\nMy due Regards to your Lady, to Mr S and his Family.\r\n\r\nAdieu,\r\n\r\nP. S.--I am not inattentive to what you said in my last relating to my\r\nFriend Mrs M. I will endeavor to serve her in the Instance she\r\nmentions, but she must not depend upon Success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JEREMIAH POWELL.1\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library; a text is in Historical\r\nMagasine, 1st ser., vol ii., pp. 196, 197.]\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA Decr 1, 1778\r\n\r\nSIR/\r\n\r\nI did myself the Honor a few Days ago, of Joyning with my Colleagues in\r\nan Answer to your Letter to us of the fifth of November last, so far as\r\nit related to the Distribution of a Quantity of Flour purchasd on\r\nAccount of the State of Massachusetts Bay. I beg Leave to refer you to\r\nour Letter, which will be forwarded by this opportunity. The five\r\nhundred Dollars therein mentiond as receivd by me, were carried to the\r\nCredit of the State in my Account settled the last Winter. Since my\r\nArrival here in July, I have availd my self of the Practice of the\r\nDelegates of every State, by applying to Congress for a Warrant on\r\ntheir Treasury for a Sum of Money to pay the extravagant, though\r\nnecessary Expence of living. I purpose to repeat this Application, as\r\nthere may be occasion for it, until I shall be directed differently or\r\nto the Contrary; and shall credit the Sums so receivd in my next\r\nAccount.\r\n\r\nI am informd that the General Assembly have been pleased to appoint me\r\none of their Delegates in Congress for the year 1779. This repeated\r\nMark of Confidence in me is indeed flattering. The Duties of the\r\nDepartment are arduous and pressing. I will never decline the Service\r\nof our Country; but my Health requires Relaxation, and at this Period\r\nof my Life my Inclination would lead me to wish to be employd in a more\r\nlimitted Sphere. I will nevertheless continue to act in Congress to the\r\nutmost of my Ability in Pursuance of the Powers and Instructions with\r\nwhich I am honord, in hopes, that as the Month of April will complete\r\nanother full Year of my Residence here, I shall then be relievd by one\r\nof my absent Colleagues or some other Gentleman, and permitted to\r\nreturn to my Family.\r\n\r\nI am with every Sentiment of Duty & Regard to the General Assembly,\r\n\r\nSir\r\n\r\nYour Honors\r\n\r\nmost obedient\r\n\r\n& very humble servant,\r\n\r\n1 President of the Council of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library; a portion of the text is in\r\nW. V. Wells, Life of Samuel Adams, vol. iii., pp. 57, 58.]\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA Decr 13 1778\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BETSY,\r\n\r\nCaptn. Johnson will deliver you this Letter, which incloses a\r\nPublication in the last Tuesdays Paper. You will easily guess which of\r\nthe Massachusetts Delegates it is intended for. The Design of it is to\r\nrepresent Mr Temple as a British Emissary and that Delegate as\r\nlistening to his Proposals of Accommodation with Great Britain, and\r\nthus to beget a Suspicion of him in the Mind of the Minister of France,\r\nwith whom he has the Honor of being on friendly Terms. That Delegate\r\nhas been so used to the low Arts of Tories in his own Country, as to\r\nhave learnd long ago to treat them, wherever he sees them, with\r\nineffable Contempt. He does not think it worth his while to satisfy the\r\nCuriosity of the Writer, but he can assure his Friends, that he had\r\nnever called on Mr T but once and that was to show him the way to Mr\r\nPresident Laurens' House, to whom he had Letters to deliver, one of\r\nwhich was from the Council of Massachusets Bay. As a Delegate from that\r\nState, he could do no less than show such a Piece of Civility to Mr T,\r\nand he is determind, notwithstanding the apparently friendly Hint, to\r\ntreat him as he thinks proper. Indeed he has been told by a real\r\nFriend, that there are Persons in Pay to watch his Words and Actions.\r\nHe thankd his Friend, and told him that such kind of Intimations were\r\nnot new to him. It might be well or ill grounded, & he was perfectly\r\nindifferent about it. He had a private Conversation a few Days ago with\r\nMonsieur --------, in which the Subject of the Hint beforementiond was brought up.\r\nThat Personage was pleasd to say, that he well knew the Character of\r\nthe Delegate before his Arrival in America, and that there was no\r\nReason to doubt of his Attachment to the joynt Interest of France &\r\nAmerica-- that he had sufficient Proofs of it to prevent any ill\r\nImpressions being made on his own Mind; with other Expressions of\r\nFriendship & Confidence. ---- ---- Between our selves, I can not say I am not\r\nembarrassd with Mr Ts Arrival here; He is highly recommended, and I\r\nbelieve him to be an honest American. But the Time & Manner of his\r\nleaving England fix a Suspicion in the Minds of well disposd Men, which\r\ncannot easily be removd; and his Residence at the Court of America, if\r\nI might so express it, gives bad Men a Sort of Occasion, to say that\r\nCongress, notwithstanding all they have publickly given out, are\r\nsecretly treating with the Ministers of Great Britain through their\r\nEmissaries in America, than which Nothing can be more contrary to\r\nTruth. I do not care therefore how soon Mr T thinks of returning to New\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nIt is diverting enough to hear the different Language held forth\r\nconcerning me, by a kind of Men whom I despise beyond Expression. In\r\nNew England they say I am averse to an Accommodation with Great\r\nBritain, and make that an Exception against me. In Philadelphia I am\r\nchargd, indirectly at least, with a frequent Exchange of Visits with\r\nthe Companion of Berkenhout, Lord Lindsay, Governor Johnston & the Son\r\nof Lord Bute, with a View of secretly bringing about an Accommodation\r\nwith that King and Nation which I have solemnly abjurd. What is there\r\nwhich Malice joynd with a small Share of Wit will not suggest! I am not\r\napt to conceal my Sentiments. They are far from being problematical.\r\nThey are well known here & at Boston; and I can trust my Consistency in\r\nthe Judgment of every honest and sensible Man that is acquainted with\r\nme. The Censure of Fools or Knaves is Applause.\r\n\r\nMr Silas Dean has lately publishd a Paper here filled with Insinuations\r\nand Assertions without any Evidence to support them, against Dr Lee. I\r\nhave long ago formd my Opinion of both those Gentlemen, and have never\r\nyet seen Reason to alter it. I have sent the Paper to my Friend General\r\nWarren. I wish you would invite him to a Dish of Tea, and desire him to\r\nlet you see it and my Letter which inclosd it. You may read this Letter\r\nto him and other Confidential Friends, but dont let it go out of your\r\nown Hands.\r\n\r\nI never was in better Spirits than at present.--My Love to my Daughter,\r\nSister Polly & the Rest of our Family & Friends. Adieu my dear Betsy,\r\n\r\nYour very affectionate,\r\n\r\nI forgot to tell you that last Friday Mr President Laurens having\r\ndischargd the Duties of his Station for more than one year with\r\nFidelity & to the Acceptance of the Members, resignd the Chair, and\r\nJohn Jay Esqr a Delegate from New York was chosen in his Room. To this\r\nGentleman I chearfully gave my Vote.\r\n\r\nMrs Clark and her Sister Miss Daily in whose house the Massachusetts\r\nDelegates are agreably scituated present their respectful Compliments\r\nto you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COUNCIL OF MASSACHUSETTS.\r\n\r\n[W. V. Wells, Life of Samuel Adams, vol. iii., p. 59; a draft is in the\r\nSamuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nMARINE COMMITTEE, PHILADELPHIA, December 15, 1778.\r\n\r\nSIR,--\r\n\r\nPursuant to the direction of Congress and the request of the Minister\r\nPlenipotentiary of France, I have the honor of transmitting to the\r\nCouncil of Massachusetts Bay a declaration under the hand and seal of\r\nthat Minister, promising a reward to every vessel that shall take or\r\ndestroy a vessel of the enemy loaded with masts or spars, and destined\r\nto the ports of Halifax, Newport, or New York. It is the particular\r\ndesire of the Minister that this declaration may be addressed to that\r\nHonorable Board, to the end that the same may be made known in such a\r\nmanner as their wisdom shall direct.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, your most obedient and very humble servant,1\r\n\r\n1 Signed by Adams as chairman of the Marine Committee of the\r\nContinental Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES BOWDOIN.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADE Decr 19th 1778\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nMr Temple1 was so obliging as to deliver me your Letter of the ---- of\r\nNovember. The Day after his Arrival in this City, I offerd him my\r\nService and introduc'd him to Mr President Laurens, to whom he had\r\nLetters of high Recommendation, and among others from the Council of\r\nMassachusetts Bay. The President read these Letters publickly in\r\nCongress. I did not fail to communicate the Contents of those which I\r\nwas honord with to individual Members. But the Time of his leaving\r\nEngland, his coming in a Packet, the Company which came with him, and\r\nthe greater Indulgencies granted to him in New York than had been\r\nallowd to others fixed a suspicion of him in the Minds of well disposd\r\nPersons which could not be removd. Those of a different Character took\r\nOccasion to insinuate that whatever Congress might give out publickly\r\nto the Contrary, they were secretly listening to Terms of Accommodation\r\nofferd by the British Ministers through their Emissaries in America.\r\nThe Minister Plenipotentiary of France could not but be attentive to\r\nthese Suggestions. In a private Conversation with him at his House the\r\nother Day, when no one was present with us, Mr Temples Name was\r\nmentiond. He said he knew not his personal Character--he understood that\r\nhe was well recommended, but as he was under the violent Suspicions of\r\nthe People here, his Residence so near the Congress might make improper\r\nImpressions on the Minds of Persons abroad. It may reasonably be\r\nsupposd that he is determind to merit the Character at his own Court,\r\nof a vigilant & faithful Minister. Mr Dean who appears to be inimical\r\nto my truly patriotick Friend A Lee Esqr has endeavord to raise the\r\nlike Suspicions of him that he has a predilection for the Court of\r\nLondon because he showed Civilities to his Friend Ld Shelburne in\r\nFrance. Such is the force of prejudice in the Minds of some Men or\r\ntheir total Want of political Understanding. I was my self, pointedly,\r\nthough not by Name, called upon in a publick Newspaper, to be cautious\r\nof making too frequent Exchanges of Visits with J T Esqr. You know much\r\nI have been used to despise Publications of this Kind & I despise them\r\nstill. But in the present Instance I confess I was embarrassd, being\r\nunder the Necessity of violating my own Inclination to pay all due\r\nRespect to a Gentleman, whose personal Merit I had formerly been\r\nacquainted with, and who was so honorably mentiond by some of my most\r\nvirtuous & dignified fellow Citizens, or on the other hand of\r\nprejudicing the Character which as a publick Man I ought to maintain in\r\nthe Minds of Congress, of the Minister of France and of the People. I\r\nhave done Mr Temple the most substantial Acts of Friendship in my\r\nPower, though I could not have the Pleasure of so much Conversation\r\nwith him as I wishd & intended to have. He leaves this City suddenly. I\r\nam inclind to believe that the President of this State as well as the\r\nChief Justice, with both of whom I have this day had the pleasure of\r\ndining, are satisfied in the Uprightness of Mr Temples Intentions.\r\nHaving given you a candid State of things, I conclude with assuring you\r\nthat I am with every Sentiment of Regard,\r\n\r\nYour affectionate Friend\r\n\r\n& very humble Servant,\r\n\r\n1 Cf. page 54.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN WINTHROP.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILAD Decr 21 1778\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nYour obliging Letter of the [9th] of November was deliverd to me by Mr\r\nTemple immediately after his Arrival here. I must candidly confess that\r\nwhen the Gentleman informd me by his Letter dated in New York, of his\r\nIntention then to pay a Visit to this City, I was disagreably impressd\r\nwith it, and interrested my self, as far as I could do it with Decency,\r\nto prevent it. A certain Dr Berkenhout was here at that Time. He had\r\nformerly been a fellow Student with Dr Lee in Edinburgh; and although\r\nhe brought no Letters from him, he made an Advantage of the old\r\nConnection, and addressd himself to Richard Henry Lee Esqr, the Doctors\r\nBrother & a Member of Congress, who from the Beginning of our Contest\r\nhas been exceedingly obnoxious to our Enemies from his firm &\r\ninvariable Attachment to our Cause. Dr Berkenhout was put into Prison\r\nby the Authority of this State on Suspicion, and afterwards dischargd\r\nfor Want of Evidence against him. Perhaps he sufferd the more, from a\r\ncertain Set of Men for valueing himself on Colo Lee; and the Colo\r\nhimself has since sufferd the Reproach of an angry Writer and\r\ndisappointed Man, for shewing Civility to a Person who was once\r\nacquainted with his Brother. So true is the Observation I have\r\nsomewhere met with, that a Man hardly ever speaks with another, but\r\nsooner or later he finds that he has receivd Good or Harm from it.\r\n\r\nHad Mr Temple arrivd at that Juncture, I do verily believe he would\r\nhave shared the Fate of Berkenhout. And the Testimonials he has since\r\nbrought with him, added to the warm Recommendations of some of my most\r\nvirtuous and honorable Fellow Citizens have not been sufficient to\r\nobtain for him a welcome Reception. The Time & Manner of his leaving\r\nEngland, the Company he came with and the favorable Treatment he met\r\nwith in New York, were judgd to be Grounds of Suspicion which more than\r\nbalanced the Recommendations of his Friends & Countrymen, who, though\r\nacknowledgd to be very respectable, it was supposd, might possibly be\r\npartial in their Judgments of him. His Connections in Boston, & the\r\nCharacter he had sustaind there before he left that Place, it was said,\r\nmade him the fittest Instrument to carry into Effect the Purposes of\r\nthe British Ministers. The honest and zealous Whigs clamord against him\r\nbecause they imagind him to be a British Emissary; and the artful\r\nTories, who would cordially receive such a Character into the Bosom of\r\ntheir Councils, if they could be sure of keeping him among themselves,\r\njoynd in the Clamor, either because they believd him to be a true\r\nAmerican, or, if they judged him to be a Spy, as they pretended, they\r\ndid not chuse to trust him in the Hands of those who might possibly\r\ndraw from him the Secrets of his Employers and detect him. The Tories\r\nappeard to be the most acute Politicians, as in my Opinion, I am sorry\r\nto say it, they too often are. Thus Mr T has had the Misfortune to be\r\nspoken ill of both by the Friends and Enemies of the Publick. A very\r\ngrievous Misfortune, when the People scrutinize and decide upon\r\nCharacters with Candor & Moderation, which perhaps does not take Place\r\nat all Times in any Country.\r\n\r\nI have shown Mr Temple the most substantial Acts of Friendship in my\r\nPower; yet I must own to you I have been somewhat embarassd. A Delegate\r\nof the Massachusetts Bay who has been heard to say that \"Jealousy is\r\nthe best Security of publick Liberty,\" has been called upon in a\r\npublick News Paper \"to be cautious of too frequently exchanging Visits\r\nwith J T Esqr who is suspected to be a Spy\" &c. I have no Reason to\r\nthink it was a friendly Caution; but rather that it was designd to\r\nbring an odious Suspicion on the Delegate himself. But though he feels\r\na Contempt of such Kind of Publications, he has learnd that it is\r\nWisdom to receive Instruction even from an Enemy. I have said that\r\nJealousy is the best Security of publick Liberty. I have expressd my\r\nFears that America is too unsuspecting long to preserve Republican\r\nLiberty. I do not suspect Mr Temple; but I have been under the\r\nNecessity of violating my own Inclination to pay every kind of Respect\r\ndue to that Gentleman, or risque the consistent Character which a\r\nDelegate of that State ought to support in the Opinion of Congress, of\r\nthe Minister of France and the People of America. I have converst with\r\nthat Minister on this Occasion; and I have Reason to think we concur in\r\nopinion, that however pure the Views & Intentions of any Gentleman may\r\nbe, yet if a Suspicion generally prevails that he is secretly employd\r\nby the British Court his continuing to reside near the Congress may\r\nmake improper Impressions on the Minds of our Friends abroad. Mr Temple\r\nleft this City yesterday.\r\n\r\nI congratulate you my dear Sir on our Countrys having thus far sustaind\r\nthe glorious Conflict. Our Independence, I think, is secured. Whether\r\nAmerica shall long preserve her Freedom or not, will depend on her\r\nVirtue.\r\n\r\nI cannot conclude this tedious Epistle without expressing an ardent\r\nWish for the full Recovery of your Health and bespeaking another &\r\nanother of your Favors.\r\n\r\nI am with most respectful Compliments to your Lady & Family,\r\n\r\nYour very affectionate Friend\r\n\r\n& humble Servt,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SAMUEL. COOPER.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA Decr 25 1778\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nI have receivd your Favors of the 7th & 20th of November, the former of\r\nwhich was deliverd to me by the Honble Mr Temple. That Gentleman is\r\nintitled to my Esteem from the opinion I entertain of his personal\r\nMerit, and from your Recommendations and those of some others of my\r\nvirtuous Fellow Citizens. I have done him every Act of Friendship in my\r\nPower; but Circumstances, of which he is not unapprized, have prevented\r\nmy having so much Conversation with him as I could have wishd for. The\r\nTime and Manner of his leaving England, the Company he came with, the\r\nfavor granted him at New York of writing a Letter to Mr President\r\nLaurens requesting Permission to pay his Respects to Congress, and\r\nanother to myself, neither of which, it was presumd, could have passd\r\nwithout the Inspection of General Clinton, nor sufferd by him to pass\r\nunless they had been adapted to his Views--These were made the Grounds of\r\nSuspicion of him then; and they were afterwards judgd sufficient to\r\noverbalance the Letters he brought from his Friends & Countrymen,\r\nrespectable as they were acknowledgd to be by all, who might be supposd\r\npossibly to have judgd partially in his Favor. I am sorry our Friend\r\nhas been thus unfortunate because I believe his Motives in coming here\r\nwere pure; and yet we must allow those, who never were acquainted with\r\nhim to give all that Weight to Circumstances which in other Instances\r\nwe mt our selves be inclind to think reasonable. I am satisfied there\r\nis a Design among them to leave no Method untried to raise a popular\r\nClamor against those who took an early active Part & have continued\r\nconsistent in Support of the Liberties of America. They are at this\r\ntime endeavoring to stimulate a Persecution against my patriotick\r\nFriend Dr Lee, who from the Knowledge I have of his publick Conduct\r\nsince he has been employd by Congress and a constant political\r\nCorrespondence with him for near ten years past, I am well assured,\r\ndeserves the highest Esteem and Gratitude of these United States and\r\nMassachusetts Bay in particular. It concerns those who are determin'd\r\nto persevere in this glorious Contest till the Liberty and Independence\r\nof America shall be firmly establishd to be exceedingly circumspect\r\nlest their Conduct should be misrepresented by designing Men and\r\nmisunderstood by others. An angry Writer has lately insinuated in a\r\npublick Newspaper among other injurious things, that Arthur Lee Esqr\r\ncommunicated the secret Negociations of France & America to the British\r\nMinisters, because he showd Civility to Lord Shelburne in Paris. Had Mr\r\nTemples Friends appeard to be very intimate with him here, the like\r\nInsinuation might have been thrown out, & with a similar View, to draw\r\nan odious Suspicion on them. Indeed such an Attempt was made as you\r\nwill observe in the inclosd Paragraph taken from Dunlaps Paper.1 You\r\nwho know much of my Heart will easily guess which of your Delegates the\r\nHint was intended for. I leave it to your Conjecture. I have openly\r\ndeclared my Opinion that Jealousy is a good Security of Publick\r\nLiberty. I have expressd my Fears that America is too unsuspecting long\r\nto continue free. These I know are the sentiments of Dr Lee. When Men\r\nhold these Sentiments & honestly act up to the Spirit of them they must\r\nnecessarily become exceedingly obnoxious to those who are watching\r\nevery Opportunity to turn the good or ill Fortune of their Country, and\r\nthey care not which to their own private Advantage. Such Men there are\r\nin this Country, in France & indeed in all Countries & at all times.\r\nSome of them you & I have known. Such Men there always have been &\r\nalways will be, till human Nature itself shall be substantially\r\nmeliorated. Whether such a Change will ever happen and when, is more\r\nwithin your Province than mine to predict or ascertain. A Politician\r\nmust take men as he finds them and while he carefully endeavors to make\r\ntheir Humours & Prejudices, their Passions & Feelings, as well as their\r\nReason & Understandings subservient to his Views of publick Liberty &\r\nHappiness, he must frequently observe among the many if he has any\r\nSagacity, some who having gaind the Confidence of their Country, are\r\nsacrilegiously employing their Talents to the Ruin of its Affairs, for\r\ntheir own private Emolument. Upon such Men he stamps the Stigma Hic\r\nniger est, and if he thinks them capable of doing great Mischief to\r\nprevent it, he ventures to hold them up to the publick Eye. This he\r\ndoes at the Risque of his own Reputation; for it is a thousand to one\r\nbut those whose Craft he puts at Hazard, will give him the odious\r\nEpithets of suspicious dissatisfiable peevish quarrelsome &c, and\r\nhonest, undiscerning Men may be indued for a time to believe them\r\npertinent; but he solaces himself in a conscious Rectitude of Heart,\r\ntrusting that it will sooner or later be made manifest; perhaps in this\r\nWorld, but most assuredly in that Day when the secret Thoughts of all\r\nMen shall be unfolded. I have many things to say to you particularly of\r\nArthur Lee & Silas Dean Esqrs. Of both these Gentlemen I long ago made\r\nup my opinion, and I have never seen Reason to alter it. But I will\r\nrelieve you by putting an End to this tedious Epistle. I intend to get\r\nmyself excusd from further publick Service here, and hope before long\r\nto think aloud with you & my other Confidential Friends in Boston. I do\r\nnot mean however to quit the Service of our Country altogether while I\r\nam capable of rendering myself in the least Degree serviceable. I\r\nearnestly wish for more Retirement & Leisure. Esto perpetua! is my most\r\nardent Prayer for this rising Republick. That will depend upon the\r\nPrinciples and Manners of the People. Publick Liberty will not long\r\nsurvive the LOSS of publick Virtue. Favor me, my dear Sir, with your\r\nLetters frequently while I remain here, and be assured of the warmest\r\nSentiments of Friendship & Esteem in the Breast of\r\n\r\nyour very affectionate,\r\n\r\n1 The Pennsylvania Packet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES CHAUNCY.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILAD Decr 25 1778\r\n\r\nREVEREND & MUCH ESTEEMED SIR\r\n\r\nI am greatly indebted to you for your very acceptable Letter of the 7th\r\nof Novr by Mr Temple. That Gentleman, in my Opinion took an unguarded\r\nStep on his late Arrival in New York. I mean his writing a Letter to\r\nthe late President Mr Laurens requesting Permission to pay his Respects\r\nto Congress, and another Letter to myself. This excited a Suspicion in\r\nthe Minds of the true Friends of our Cause, that what they had before\r\nseen in the English News papers, viz that he & Dr Berkenhout were sent\r\nto America by the British Ministry might not be without Grounds. This\r\nDesire of paying a respectful Visit to Congress was judgd to be a\r\nReason merely ostensible; and the Time & Manner of his leaving England,\r\nthe Company he came with and the Readiness with which the British\r\nGeneral granted him the Liberty of sending his Letters, the Contents of\r\nwhich must most undoubtedly have been under his Inspection, it was\r\nsaid, afforded Reason to believe his real Design was to gain an\r\nhonorable Admission into this City, & the Confidence of Members of\r\nCongress & others thereby the more easily to cooperate with the British\r\nCommissioners, and carry their Designs into Effect. The Jealousy of the\r\nPeople when it is properly directed or as some chuse to call it, a\r\nprudent Caution, is in my Opinion one of the best Securities of publick\r\nLiberty. And we must allow them to give all that Weight to a Train of\r\nCircumstances respecting our Friend, which in other Instances we shd\r\nourselves judge to be reasonable. His Friends have given him high\r\nRecommendations. But say others, his Friends may be partial to him. His\r\nConnections are among the warmest Patriots. His Testimonials come from\r\nthe most virtuous Citizens. They have a good Opinion of him. True, and\r\nthis might be a strong Inducement to a politick Minister to make Choice\r\nof him, & may make him the fittest Instrument to answer his Purpose.\r\nFor my own Part I know Mr Temples former Character Conduct & Sufferings\r\n& have also a good opinion of him. I have done him the most substantial\r\nActs of Friendship in my Power. But so deep rooted were the Suspicions\r\nof him and so general, that I have been under a Necessity of forbearing\r\nto visit him so often as I otherwise should have done, lest I might\r\nlose that consistent Character and that Confidence which it is my Duty\r\nas far as I am able, to support, in the Minds of Congress, the Minister\r\nof our Ally & the People of America. I have Reason to believe that I am\r\non Terms of Friendship with the Sieur Gerard. In private Conversation\r\nwith him, I purposely mentiond Mr Temples Name, & I conclude we concur\r\nin Sentiment that however upright the Heart of any Gentleman may be yet\r\nif an Opinion prevails among the People that he is a secret Emissary\r\nfrom the Enemy, his Residence near the Congress, might, at this\r\nJuncture especially, make improper Impressions on the Minds of our\r\nFriends abroad. Mr Temple has lately taken his Leave of this City & I\r\nbelieve some Gentlemen of Character have since conceivd a more\r\nfavorable Opinion of him than they did before.\r\n\r\nYou have my hearty Thanks for your Sermon lately publishd which I have\r\nread with pleasure. The Evil you therein mention is indeed alarming.\r\nAmidst the great Variety of pressing Affairs, Congress is devoting\r\ncertain Hours of every Day to investigate a radical Cure; and I am in\r\nstrong Hopes that an effectual Plan will shortly be laid before the\r\nGeneral Assemblies of the several States.\r\n\r\nWhen General Gates was orderd to Boston a considerable Embarkation of\r\nthe Enemies Troops had been made at N York & it was apprehended they\r\nwould attempt a Landing somewhere near that Place. His military\r\nAbilities and Experience, his political Principles & Attachments and\r\nthe Confidence which the Troops and People of the Eastern States had in\r\nhim, were the Considerations which indued his being sent thither. Had\r\nthe Enemy turnd their whole Force that way of Course the Commander in\r\nChief would have followd. General Heath has given entire Satisfaction\r\nto Congress during his Command there. The Change took Place on the Spur\r\nof the Occasion, and probably in the Spring a different Arrangemt may\r\nbe made.\r\n\r\nI am my dear Sir with the most cordial Esteem & Affectionate,\r\n\r\nyour Friend\r\n\r\n& very humble Servt,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1779\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SAMUEL COOPER.\r\n\r\n[MS , Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nJany 3 -79\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nI embrace the opportunity which now offers of writing a few Lines to\r\nyou. In my last I told you I had many things to say particularly\r\nconcerning A L & S D Esqrs 1. If I could have the Pleasure of sitting\r\nwith you by a fire Side, I would more freely open my Mind to you than I\r\nchuse to do upon Paper, considering the Risque of its falling into\r\nwrong hands. One of these gentlemen, as I was informd in the year 74 by\r\nsome who were well acquainted with him, was of a dubious political\r\nCharacter, and was appointed a Delegate in Congress by a Majority of\r\nonly one of the Electors; it being thought that his own Vote turnd it\r\nin his favor. In 75 he was again elected; and he very early attachd him\r\nself to Men of different Sentiments from those which most if not all\r\nyour Delegates brought with them from your Country & strenuously\r\nmaintained. This Difference of Sentiment was said to arise from local\r\nAttachments, but in Reality they arose from different Principles &\r\nViews. What Mr Ds political Principles were if he had any I never could\r\nlearn. His Views always appeard to me commercial & interrested. Whether\r\nI was mistaken or not Time perhaps will soon discover. He was very\r\nlittle known in America till the year 75, if at all in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe other took an early, decided and active Part in Support of the\r\ngreat Cause. In London he had a great Share in the open Opposition made\r\nto the Tyranny of the British Court & their Measures respecting\r\nAmerica. There he turnd his Attention from the Practice of Physick to\r\nwhich he had been regularly educated in Edinburgh, to the Study of the\r\nLaw. This he did by the Advice of some of the most able Advocates for\r\nthe Liberties of America, from an Opinion they had conceivd of his\r\npromising Usefulness to that Cause in that Way. He answerd their\r\nProspects. He constantly aided your Agent the late Mr De Berdt2 to whom\r\nhis Knowledge of Affairs renderd his Services essential. That his Pen\r\nwas employd for America in General, his Junius Americanus abundantly\r\ntestifies; and that, and his other Publications witness his Attachments\r\nto Massachusetts Bay & South Carolina in particular. His private\r\nLetters to his Friends are written with that Freedom as well as Zeal\r\nwhich would have exposd him to the Risque even of his Life from the\r\nResentment of an unprincipled & nefarious Court, if any of them by\r\nAccident or Design had fallen into their Hands. This I know to be true.\r\nI must conclude at present with giving it to you as my fix'd Opinion,\r\nfounded on particular observations, that there is a joynt Combination\r\nof political & commercial Men to exclude all vigilant Patriots from\r\npublick Councils & Employments knowing that Vigilance & unimpeachd,\r\nunsuspected Fidelity will be an effectual Bar to the carrying such\r\npolitico commercial Plans into Execution. I will write to you again by\r\nthe first good Opportunity. In the mean time I am with perfect Esteem,\r\n\r\nYr affectionate Friend,\r\n\r\n1 Arthur Lee and Silas Deane.\r\n\r\n2 Cf. Vol. I., page 89 et seq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES WARREN.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library,]\r\n\r\nPHILADE Jan 6 -79\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nIn your last you desire to know how Matters have operated since the\r\nRecall. I will answer this Question at another Time when I have more\r\nLeisure; and at present only say, that Mr Dean arrivd here, I think in\r\nJuly, and in August he was admitted into the House, or to use his own\r\nPhrase had an Audience, in which, with as much Vanity as I ever saw in\r\na Man of Sense, he assumd to himself almost the whole Merit of all the\r\nServices which had been renderd at least by Americans in France; as if\r\nhe would have it to be believd that one of his Colleagues had done but\r\nlittle if any thing, the other worse than Nothing, himself every thing.\r\nAnd with as much Spleen & ill Nature he would even go out of the\r\nregular Path of Decency & Propriety to draw in Invective and diminish\r\nthe Characters of the two Mr Lees & Mr Izard.1 In short the publication\r\nwhich you have seen is a Specimen of his Narrative. I have before given\r\nyou my opinion of that Performance, and shall not trouble you further\r\nupon that, than just to remark that his insinuating that Mr W L2 still\r\nremains an Alderman of the City of London, because his Name is inserted\r\nin that List in the Court Kallendar of 78 discovers something more than\r\nChildishness and Folly. His design seems to be at once to prejudice the\r\nReputation of that Gentleman in the Minds of his Countrymen and to hold\r\nup the Appearance of glaring Impropriety of Conduct in Congress, in\r\nappointing the Alderman of London an American Commissioner; and that\r\nthis was done through the undue Influence of family Connections; for he\r\ntakes particular Care to inform his Readers, that the two Brothers in\r\nEurope have two Brothers in Congress which cannot be denied. Neither\r\ncan it be denied, that they are a Family, who have been as early, as\r\nuniform, as persevering and as able Patriots as perhaps any in the\r\nUnited States. Mr A L, you are fully sensible was most indefatigable in\r\nsupporting our Cause in England. By penetrating into the Designs of a\r\nmost unprincipled Court, he was able to give us the most timely and\r\nimportant Intelligence, which he did at the Risque of his Life; while\r\nMr D was, in the Opinion of some of his own Countrymen as well as\r\nothers, of a doubtful political Character. Mr Lee continued to transmit\r\nto our Friends in France as well as to Congress before he left England,\r\nthe most accurate Accounts of things there. Such was the opinion\r\nentertaind by Congress of his Abilities his Integrity, his Zeal and\r\nAttachment to his Country which indeed had been long experiencd, that\r\nhe was employd as a most useful & necessary Man. The vigilant Eye of so\r\nconsistent a Patriot, may be formidable to a Combination of political &\r\nCommercial Men, who may be aiming to get the Trade, the Wealth, the\r\nPower and the Government of America into their own Hands. He must\r\ntherefore be hunted down; and the young as well as the old Hounds are\r\nall ready for the Game.\r\n\r\nAdieu,\r\n\r\n1 Ralph Izard. Cf.

The Bearer of this Letter is a\r\nyoung Gentleman of your Country who is passing thro this place in his\r\nway home. He appears sensible, tells me he was educated at H. College,\r\nhas since studied Physick, was taken at Sea & carried into England, was\r\nliberated or made his Escape & went over to France, from Paris he went\r\nto Dunkirk on the Encouragement of Mr Dean & enterd Surgeon on board\r\nthe Revenge Sloop, built by order of a Come of Congress authorizd\r\nthereto & at the Continental Expense, and till lately supposd to have\r\never since remaind Continental Property, but now so invelopd in\r\npolitical Commercial Mystery as that it cannot be ascertaind whether\r\nshe is ownd by the United States or private Persons, or whether she is\r\nthe property partly publick & private. I will tell you more of this\r\nMatter when the Mystery shall be unraveld if it ever is; in the mean\r\ntime remember my dear Sir what I said in my last of commercial\r\nCombinations.\r\n\r\nIn the latter End of 75 one of the Characters in my last was left out\r\nof the Delegation of the Colony he had represented, and a Number of his\r\nFriends gave him a sort of Certificate or Letter of Recommendation as\r\nthey had before done to one of your Delegates,1 which led me to think\r\nit was their Opinion he needed a Prop in his own Country. Soon after,\r\nthe Congress appointed a secret Committee of Commerce, with a View of\r\nprocuring from abroad the necessary Articles for carrying on the War.\r\nThey also appointed a secret Committee of Correspondence. Their\r\nBusiness was to form political Connections abroad & to feel the\r\npulsations of foreign Powers & particularly France. The first of these\r\nCommittees engagd Mr ------ to go to that Kingdom for the purpose of their\r\nCommission & the Corresponding Come took the Advantage of his intended\r\nResidence there to facilitate the salutary Purpose of their\r\nAppointment. At the same Time they wrote a Letter to Mr ---- then in England\r\nfrom whom the Congress had before receivd the most accurate\r\nIntelligence, requesting a Correspondence with him & pledging Secrecy &\r\nConfidence. Mr ---- arrivd in France in June 76. Thus you see we had an\r\nIntelligencer to let us know what was doing or meditating against us in\r\nEngland; and a political Commercial Agent who was to inform us what was\r\ndoing or could be done for us in France. The one had before settled a\r\nCorrespondence & formd Connections in several parts of the Continent of\r\nEurope & particularly France; the other was a perfect Stranger in every\r\nNation in Europe, but bearing Letters to considerable Men there. The\r\none was altogether the political Man, the other had to do with Commerce\r\nas well as politicks. The one by his Address obtaind in England such\r\nAssurances as satisfied him that France would afford such Aid to\r\nAmerica as she could consistently, the other was better skilld in the\r\ncommercial Part of his Agency than the political. The one in London in\r\nthe Months of March and April discoverd that he might successfully &\r\nactually did treat with a Merchant in France of no Capital but a\r\nfavorite at Court for a Supply to the Value of L200,000 sterling--the other\r\narrivd in the Month of June following, found him out & was somehow\r\nconcernd in forwarding the Supplys thus contracted for. I dare say you\r\nare apt to draw this Conclusion that the one was the political\r\nNegotiator in this Instance & the other the Commercial Agent only--yet,\r\nwill you believe it, it is positively affirmd that the one did every\r\nthing & the other Nothing. I will explain it to you in my next.\r\n\r\n1 Cf. Vol. III., p. 269.\r\n\r\nTO SAMUEL COOPER.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nJany 19-79\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nInclosd is the Newspaper of this Day. Philalethes in attempting to show\r\nthat the Supplys from France were not a Present from that Court, which\r\nnobody that I know of has asserted, has abundantly proved one thing\r\nwhich Common Sense has insisted on viz that A Lee had been negociating\r\nwith Mr Beaumarchais for those Supplys, before Mr Dean arrivd there. No\r\none I suppose would have thought of weighing Mr Deans Merit so\r\ncritically, had he appeard content with his full Share of it. But when\r\nhe takes so much Pains to represent his Colleagues as having done\r\nNothing, it becomes a Piece of Justice to enquire whether they have in\r\nReality been such unconcernd or impotent Spectators of their Countrys\r\nMisery and Want. Dr Franklin has the Honor of being Mr Deans venerable\r\nFriend; Mr Lee, an insignificant or troublesome Colleague. And yet Mary\r\nJohnsons assiduous Applications procurd the sending a Ship loaded with\r\nMerchandise & Stores to the Value of twenty five Thousand Pounds\r\nSterling; and this Negociation was settled before Mr Deans Arrival in\r\nFrance. Mr Lee acted as the political Minister. He pressd on Mr\r\nBeaumarchais \"the maintaining the War in America as the great Object.\"\r\nAnd indeed it was so. Mr Lee and every Man of Discernment knew, that it\r\nwas the Policy of France to consider it in this View. On this\r\nConsideration he succeeded, and yet, says Mr Beaumarchais, \"the\r\nGratitude of Congress is due to the indefatigable Pains Mr Dean has\r\ntaken thro' the whole of the Commercial Transaction.\" The Truth is, as\r\nI suppose, that Mr Dean did not care to return without some such Letter\r\nof Recommendation; and it was probably as easily obtaind as the other\r\nwhich I mentiond in my last. Mr Beaumarchais is a Man of Ingenuity &\r\nWit. Horace was the Delight of the Court of Augustus. A Royal Letter &\r\na Snuff Box, as I once told one of my Friends, are Things of Course,\r\nespecially in the Honey Moon of National Matrimony. A Monarch politely\r\ncompliments thro' the Minister the Ministers Sovereign. When the\r\nMerchant and the Courtier unite in one Man, the Courtier is safe in\r\nimitating his Master, and pays his Compliment in the Stile & Manner of\r\nthe Merchant.\r\n\r\nMr Deans Friends are in hopes he will be sent to Holland as a Reward\r\nfor his good Services, from whence he may probably send or bring\r\nanother mercantile Letter of Recommendation. Doubtless deep Commercial\r\nConnections may be formd there. They are willing Mr J A should go to\r\nSpain. The Design of this is to get Mr A L removd from thence. Others\r\nare for sending Mr A to Holland leaving Mr L in Spain, to whose\r\nInfluence in that Country our Armies are indebted for Supplys of\r\nBlanketts Shoes and Stockins. I am sorry to be obligd to think, that a\r\nMonopoly of Trade, and not the Liberty of their Country, is the sole\r\nObject of some Mens Views. This is the Cake which they hope shortly to\r\nslice and share among themselves.\r\n\r\nAdieu,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JONATHAN TRUMBULL.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILAD Feb 6 -79\r\n\r\nSIR\r\n\r\nThe Marine Come have done themselves the Honor of writing to you by\r\nthis Post. The great Dammage which has been done to the Trade at the\r\nSouthward & particularly Chessapeak Bay by the Enemies Privateers has\r\ncausd such pressing Demands for the Aid of our Ships of War as laid us\r\nunder the Necessity of ordering the Queen of france immediately on a\r\nCruize that Way. This I mention as a Reason why she could not be\r\nemployd with the Confederacy & the other Ships but her Destination will\r\nremain a Secret.\r\n\r\nI hope the Expedition proposd by your Excy & agreed to by the Come will\r\nbe performd in 2 or 3 Days, for I fear if it should be known to the\r\nEnemy, not only the desired Event wd be prevented but there would be\r\ndanger of our losing our Ships.\r\n\r\nI have only time to beg the favor of your Excy to forward the inclosd\r\nby the first Oppty by the post or otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN WINTHROP.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADE Feb 6 1779\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nI have receivd your favor of the 21st of January. Every Body sees that\r\nthe Depreciation of the Paper Currency is owing to the Floods of it\r\nwhich have been necessarily issued. In Addition to which a great\r\nQuantity more especially of the Emissions of 20 May 1777 & 11 April\r\n1778 has been counterfeited. This last Consideration was sufficient\r\nInducement to the calling out of Circulation all the Bills of those\r\nEmissions as speedily as possible. The lessening the Quantity in\r\nCirculation is the only Means of restoring the Value & Credit of the\r\nRemainder. It would therefore be a happy Event if every possessor of\r\nthem would receive Loan Office Certificates for them instead of new\r\nBills in June next but this cannot be expected. In proportion as this\r\nmay be done the only effectual Means, besides that of taxing which I\r\nhope will be chearfully submitted to by the People, of remedying the\r\ngreat Evil will have its effect. Congress have not cried down those\r\nEmissions, as the Expression is or resolvd that the Bills should sink\r\nin the Hands of those who would not exchange them for Loan Office\r\nCertificates, as has been done in the Eastern States. This might have\r\nbeen too harsh a Remedy. They have left it in the Option of the\r\nPossessors to receive either such Certificates or new Bills. This is\r\nthe obvious Intention of their Resolutions on the Subject. The Wish of\r\nevery discerning honest Man must be as obvious, viz that as many of the\r\nBills may sink in the Loan Offices as the People can possibly spare,\r\nand as soon as possible. I think therefore you have judgd right of\r\ntheir Views. It would be an Act of Charity and a great Service to the\r\npublick if those who can afford to put their Money to Interest would\r\nease their poorer fellow Citizens who are possessd of those Bills, by\r\nexchanging them for other Bills without a Discount.\r\n\r\nI am &c,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SAMUEL ALLYNE OTIS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library]\r\n\r\nPHILADE Feby 10 1779\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR\r\n\r\nThe late Mr Andrews before his sudden & unexpected Death had written to\r\na young Kinsman of mine in this place, Mr Richard Checkley, proposing\r\nto him to go to Boston with a View of employing him in his Warehouse. I\r\nknow not whether Mr A intended to employ him in his own separate\r\nAffairs or in those in which he was joyntly concernd with you for the\r\npublick. Mr C had not heard of his Death till he was just about setting\r\noff on his Journey to Boston when I informd him of it. He is a young\r\nMan who, I am told, bears a good Character and is used to Business. If\r\nyou can employ him it will be doing him a singular Benefit and I shall\r\nacknowledge it as a great favor. I ask it only on this Condition, that\r\nit may be perfectly consistent with your Views. I am with Cordial\r\nEsteem, Sir\r\n\r\nyr hble Servt\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES WARREN.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADE Feb 12 -79\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SR\r\n\r\nWill you be so kind as to present my due Regards to Mrs Warren and let\r\nher know that immediately on my receiving her Letter for Miss Wray I\r\ndeliverd it to the Care of my worthy Friend Colo Laurens who has since\r\ninformd me that he has forwarded it in his own Packet to South Carolina.\r\n\r\nI have lately written several Letters to my Friend Dr C & have informd\r\nhim that you & he & Mr S are my only confidential Correspondents in\r\nBoston. I have other trusty Friends there, but I have not Leisure to\r\nwrite to them all. I have expressd my wish that the honest & virtuous\r\nFriends of our Country would cultivate a cordial Esteem for each other.\r\nI am affraid there are little Jealousies among them which prevent their\r\nuniting their Councils and Efforts against that Inundation of Levity\r\nVanity Luxury Dissipation & indeed Vice of every kind which I am\r\ninformd threatens that Country which has heretofore stood with\r\nunexampled Firmness in the Cause of Liberty and Virtue. This Torrent\r\nmust be stemmed, and in order to do it effectually, there must be\r\nAssociations of Men of unshaken Fortitude. A general Dissolution of\r\nPrinciples & Manners will more surely overthrow the Liberties of\r\nAmerica than the whole Force of the Common Enemy. While the People are\r\nvirtuous they cannot be subdued; but when once they lose their Virtue\r\nthey will be ready to surrender their Liberties to the first external\r\nor internal Invader. How necessary then is it for those who are\r\ndetermind to transmit the Blessings of Liberty as a fair Inheritance to\r\nPosterity, to associate on publick Principles in Support of publick\r\nVirtue. I do verily believe, and I may say it inter Nos, that the\r\nPrinciples & Manners of N Engd, producd that Spirit which finally has\r\nestablishd the Independence of America; and Nothing but opposite\r\nPrinciples and Manners can overthrow it. If you are of my Mind, and I\r\nthink you are, the Necessity of supporting the Education of our Country\r\nmust be strongly impressd on your Mind. It gives me the greatest\r\nConcern to hear that some of our Gentlemen in the Country begin to\r\nthink the Maintenance of Schools too great a Burden. I wish they could\r\nhear the Encomiums that are given to N Engd by some of the most\r\nsensible & publick spirited Gentlemen in the southern States, for the\r\nCare & Expence which have been freely borne by our Ancestors & continued\r\n to this time for the Instruction of youth. Virginia is duly sensible\r\nof the great Importance of Education, and, as a friend in that Country\r\ninforms me, has lately adopted an effectual Plan for that necessary\r\nPurpose. If Virtue & Knowledge are diffusd among the People, they will\r\nnever be enslavd. This will be their great Security. Virtue & Knowledge\r\nwill forever be an even Balance for Powers & Riches. I hope our\r\nCountrymen will never depart from the Principles & Maxims which have\r\nbeen handed down to us from our wise forefathers. This greatly depends\r\nupon the Example of Men of Character & Influence of the present Day.\r\nThis is a Subject my Heart is much set upon. But I fear I have wearied\r\nyour Patience. I will conclude with my most ardent Prayer that our last\r\nDays may be our best Days and our last Works our best Works.\r\n\r\nAdieu my dear Friend,\r\n\r\nPay my due Regards to your Circle in Plymouth. Are you intimate with Mr\r\nD. I mentiond him to you in a former Letter as an excellent Republican.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE BOARD OF WAR AT BOSTON.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILAD Feb 16 1779\r\n\r\nGENTN\r\n\r\nI recd your Letr of 27 Jan and immediately communicated such of the\r\nContents as relate to your Application to the Govr of N Y, to the\r\nDelegates of that State. They assured me that the Govrs refusing to\r\ngrant a Permit to Mr Shepperd for the Transportation of Flour from\r\nthence must have been owing to the real & very great Scarcity of that\r\nArticle there; and they desired me to satisfy you in that point,\r\nfearing that it mt be supposd to arise from other Motives. I will\r\nconsult with my Colleagues and if any Means can be used by us to ensure\r\nSuccess to your Application from that Quarter you may depend upon our\r\nExertion.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to think that Govr C, who in my Opinion is a truly good\r\nMan, is apprehensive of being imposd upon by Speculators, unless he\r\nuses great Caution; and he may perhaps not be fully apprisd of your\r\nasking under the express Authority & Commission of Massachusetts State.\r\nAnd yet I shd suppose your Letter to him would have been sufficient\r\nwithout authenticated Documents manifesting your Appointment. South\r\nCarolina is at so great a Distance that no Interposition of ours could\r\navail, if it were necessary in the present Instance; but I am of\r\nOpinion there will be no Difficulty there in Case your Vessel arrives,\r\nthe Embargo being over. I will write to Mess P in B & endeavor, shd\r\nthere be any obstructions there to get them removd. A Come of Con have\r\nunder Consideration a Letter from the Council of M B1 on the Subject of\r\nprovisions, & I am informd they are ready to make Report.\r\n\r\nIf any thing shd occur which will make it expedient for me to write you\r\nfurther I shall not omit the first Oppty. In the mean time I am &c,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SAMUEL COOPER.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILAD Feb 21-79\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nBy the last Post I sent to Mr W C2 some Extracts from an extraordinary\r\nLetter which I hope he has receivd. I think our Apprehensions are\r\nthereby strengthned, of an intended Monopoly of all the Trade and I may\r\nadd of the richest Lands in America. The private & publick Letters of\r\nmy Friend on the other side of the Atlantick having honestly stated\r\nFacts and led to important Discoveries, have renderd him an object of\r\nthe hottest Resentment of interrested Men. I protest to you solemnly\r\nthat the warm Affection I feel for a Man whom I never saw, is founded\r\nin a thorough Conviction of his long and unremitted Attachment to the\r\nInterests of America & of Mankind. But I will leave this Subject for\r\nthe present.\r\n\r\nThe Spring advances, and very probably some new Overtures may soon be\r\nmade, if it is only to feel the Pulse of America. Perhaps there may be\r\na real Design in the British Cabinet to propose Terms of Accommodation.\r\nWe ought then to be previously thoughtful of so serious and momentous a\r\nSubject. I have Reason to think that Britain finds herself perplexd in\r\nthe forming of Alliances and procuring Resources to her Satisfaction.\r\nShe has repeatedly and in vain applied to Russia first for Ships of War\r\n& then for Troops. Her disappointment may be owing to the superior\r\nPolicy of France, who by interesting Russia as well as her self in the\r\nAffairs of Prussia & the Empress of Germany may have made it improper\r\nfor Russia to take any Measure which might tend to involve Europe in\r\nWar. I am affraid if we should be seriously engagd in negociating a\r\nPeace, there would be an intemperate pressing from without Doors for a\r\nspeedy Conclusion, which would precipitate the Affair to our\r\nDisadvantage. It is probable that Peace may be the desireable Object in\r\nall the Courts in Europe while they are making the necessary\r\nArrangements and preparing for War if that shd be the Event. If Britain\r\nshould refuse to acknowledge the Independence of America a War with\r\nFrance & Spain wd probably ensue and the flame would spread. In that\r\nCase, Britain might be obligd so far to withdraw her Troops from\r\nAmerica as to leave it in our power with the Spirit of Enterprize to\r\nmake such Acquisitions as wd ensure a safe & lasting Peace. But if\r\nEurope shall remain quiet & Britain with the Acknowledgmt of our\r\nIndependence shd pro pose Terms of Accommodation, would it be safe for\r\nAmerica to leave Canada, Nova Scotia & Florida in her hands. I do not\r\nfeel my self at a LOSS to answer this Question; but I wish to be\r\nfortified with the Sentiments of my judicious Friends. You may easily\r\ndiscern that I write this Letter in the utmost Hurry.\tAdieu.\r\n\r\n1 Massachusetts Bay.\r\n\r\n2 William Cooper.\r\n\r\nTO MRS. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADE March 7-1779--\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BETSY\r\n\r\nYesterday your obliging Letter of the 3d of February was deliverd to me\r\nby Mr Hoskins. I thank you for the Concern you express for my Health,\r\nwhich through the Divine Favor I again enjoy as usual. The Advice you\r\ngive me on this Head shall be duly regarded.\r\n\r\nYour Wish that I would resign the Office of Secretary perfectly\r\ncoincides with my own Inclination. I never sought for that or any other\r\nPlace. Indeed I never was pleasd with it, for Reasons which you are not\r\nunacquainted with. I am very sorry for Mr ---- that he should treat me with\r\nUnkindness. I never gave any just occasion for it; but if he was bid to\r\ndo it, how could he disobey? I heartily forgive him, for I do verily\r\nbelieve it did not proceed from the Malevolence of his Heart. To do him\r\nJustice I must say he is a good naturd Man, and would do the Duties of\r\nthat office better than I should. But if he depends upon the Interest\r\nof a certain popular Gentleman he may be disappointed; for he proposd\r\nlast Summer to Mr L, who mentiond it to me with a generous Disdain. But\r\na Change of Place oftentimes induces a Change of Opinion, and even a\r\nPromise made in York Town or Philadelphia, may be forgot in the Hurry\r\nof Affairs in Boston. I do not think Mr A. is my Enemy; or if he is, I\r\nam under no great Apprehensions from it. There are others who are of\r\nmuch more Consideration, at least in their own Estimation than he; and\r\neven these might upon certain Conditions be made my Friends. I mean as\r\nmuch my Friends as they are or can be to one another. A few flattering\r\nSpeeches to this Man, and a Promise to that, of a Vote & Interest to\r\nkeep him snug in the Possession of Places & Emoluments would\r\neffectually secure their gracious Smiles. But who would condescend to\r\nsuch Baseness for the Friendship of any Man? Let those who can do this,\r\nenjoy the Fruits of it. I do not covet them upon such Terms. I should\r\nbecome contemptible in my own Eyes; and you know that I had rather be\r\ndespisd by all the World, hard as my Fate would be, than to be\r\nconscious to my self that I deservd Contempt.\r\n\r\nI receivd a Letter a few Days ago from France dated the 7th of\r\nDecember, in which my patriotick Friend Arthur Lee is mentiond in Terms\r\nof the highest Confidence and Respect. I will give you the following\r\nExtracts.--\" Your old Friend is a Man of Honor and Integrity \"--\" He has been\r\nof Opinion that the publick Money has been too freely issued here, and\r\nhas often opposd it.\"--\"Insinuations, I have been told, have been made at\r\nCourt against him, that he was too friendly to the English, too much\r\nattachd to Lord Shelburne, and even that he corresponded with his\r\nLordship and communicated Intelligence to him. This, whoever suggested\r\nit, I am perfectly confident was a cruel Calumny, and could not have\r\nmade Impression, if his Colleagues had contradicted it in the Manner\r\nyou and I should have done. You and I have had Opportunity to know his\r\ninvariable Attachment to our Cause long before Hostilities commencd;\r\nand I have not a Colour of Ground for Suspicion that from that time to\r\nthis he has deviated an Iota from the Cause of his Country, in Thought\r\nWord or Deed. When he left England, or soon after, he wrote a Letter of\r\nmere Compliment to his Lordship, a mere Card to bid him farewell, and\r\nreceivd such another in Return; which he assures me are all the Letters\r\nthat ever passd between them, and I have not a Doubt of the Truth of\r\nit\"--\"Some of the Gentlemen of Character who are now in America from this\r\nCountry, particularly the ---- and ----, it is to be feard, have had Prejudices\r\ninsinuated into them against your old Correspondent. I am extremely\r\nsorry for this, because I think it is against a worthy Character, and\r\nbecause I think it will be likely to have unhappy Effects both with you\r\nand abroad.\"\r\n\r\nYou may show the foregoing Extracts to such of my Confidential Friends\r\nas you think proper. They are the Sentiments of one in whom they have\r\ngreat Confidence, and may serve to convince them that the Insinuations\r\nof Mr Dean though artfully made and designed to prejudice the\r\nReputation of an honest Man, are groundless, and that Dr Lee, who took\r\nan early decided and active Part in this glorious Contest, continues\r\nthe consistent Patriot.\r\n\r\nYour Letters my dear, cannot come to me too frequently. Remember me to\r\nmy Daughter, Sister Polly, Brother Tommy and other Friends, and be\r\nassured that I am\r\n\r\nmost affectionately\r\n\r\nyour\r\n\r\nMarch 9th\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nMar 9 [1779]\r\n\r\nMr L will write you fully by this Oppty. I take up my pen chiefly to\r\nlet you know that I am in the Land of the Living and bear you\r\naffectionately on my Mind. While I am in this World I am resolvd that\r\nno Vexation shall put me out of Temper if I can possibly command\r\nmyself. Even old Age which is making Strides towards me shall not\r\nprevail to make me peevish. I find that an older Man than I am, can in\r\nthe apparent Coolness of Mind, stabb a dreaded Rival to the Vitals. His\r\nWords are like Honey, but there is a large Mixture of Poison. You who\r\nare in the Midst of Life & Usefulness, do not expect to escape the\r\nenvenomd Shaft, but you have always the Cure at hand, Moderation,\r\nFortitude & Prudence. It matters little what becomes of an old worn out\r\nServt in this World. He has his foot on the Grave & with Pleasure views\r\nit. But the virtuous Patriot, who is in the full Exercise of the Powers\r\nof Body & Mind, shall have my remaining feeble Voice in his Support agt\r\nthe insidious Enemy of him & Mankind. I have said eno on this Head, &\r\nhave not time to begin a new Subject. Adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO BENJAMIN AUSTIN.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADE Mar 9--79\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nMr Hoskins who arrivd here a few days ago, was kind enough to deliver\r\nto me your favor of the 7th of Feb. It gave me a particular pleasure,\r\nbecause I was convincd that you had not totally forgot your old Friend.\r\nYou see, I rank myself among your friends. HOW often have we chatted\r\ntogether by the fire side, and settled essential Points to mutual\r\nSatisfaction. Yet we have not always thought alike of Men who have\r\nconducted the noble Contest for the Rights of our Country, which we\r\nhave been & are still engagd in. I congratulate my Countrymen on our\r\nhaving thus far got through the Conflict, but we are still engagd in\r\nit. And I repeat it, because while too many of our Countrymen are\r\nflattering themselves with the airy Prospect of Peace, Britain, if we\r\nmay credit our latest & best Accounts from Europe, is preparing for a\r\nvigorous Campaign. It is prudent for us to enquire of the Watchman What\r\nof the Night? The Caution given us on another occasion may with\r\npropriety be adapted to this. Be ye ready; lest when the Time of Danger\r\napproaches, ye be found distracted with the eager Pursuit of Riches, or\r\nsleeping in the delusive Lap of pleasure & Dissipation. But this is a\r\nDigression from the intended Subject of my Letter. You ask my opinion\r\nof two Men who have lately appeard on the publick Stage; and with your\r\nusual Frankness, express your own opinion without a Doubt, that\r\nCongress will soon convince the one of his Folly & the other of his\r\nWeakness. But have you not misunderstood the Characters of these Men?\r\nHas not the first by his artful Address conceald his Weakness from the\r\npub-lick Eye, while the other, by an improper Use of the Weapons in his\r\nhands, has given Advantage to his Adversary, and thereby discoverd his\r\nFolly. Mr Dean had in his first Publication said so much as to make it\r\nnecessary that some other Person should say more. Common Sense\r\nundertook the Task and producd stubborn & undeniable facts, but not\r\ncontenting himself with relating such facts only as were pertinent to\r\nhis Argument he gave occasion to the Swarms of Writers against him to\r\navail themselves, by diverting the Attention of his Readers from the\r\nproper Point. I will mention an Instance. After he had provd to the\r\nSatisfaction of every one, that the Cannon & Stores forwarded to\r\nAmerica by Mr Deane, had been negociated by Mary Johnson & Beaumarchais\r\nbefore his Arrival in France, and consequently that the Merit of the\r\nNegociation did not belong to Mr Dean, what Necessity was there for\r\nCommon Sense to mention them as a Present? It was nothing to his\r\npurpose; and it was too delicate a Subject for him to touch upon, or to\r\nattempt to prove if it had been true. His prudence therefore and even\r\nhis Veracity was called in Question by his Adversaries, and his\r\nAuthority & Influence as a Writer of facts lessend. The faithful\r\nHistorian however, will hereafter unfold the secret Politicks of the\r\npresent Day. The Newspaper Writings of these two Men, have drawn not\r\nonly the Conduct but the Characters of others into Dispute. Had Mr Dean\r\nbeen only called upon explicitly to state his Charges, if he had any,\r\nagainst Dr Lee, I believe he would not have attempted it, and a\r\nScrutiny of any Mans Character but his own would have been unnecessary.\r\nAlthough he has insinuated many things against the Doctor, & steppd\r\naside from the Line of Propriety & Decency to bring in Invective, yet I\r\ndo not recollect that he has explicitly criminated him in either, nor\r\ndo I believe it is in his Power. If no one steps forward to accuse him,\r\nwhy should his Integrity be doubted? Why should you, my Friend, express\r\nyourself in so languid a Tone, \"I cant yet but have a great opinion of\r\nDr Lee,\" and \"rather than the Cause of America should be betrayd I\r\nwould give up the dearest Connections I have on Earth.\" Has Dr Lee\r\nforfeited the good opinion you \"always had\" of him? Do you doubt his\r\nIntegrity & Attachment to the Cause of America? Has any one chargd him\r\nwith Mal Conduct? Shall the mere Insinuations & angry Reflections of a\r\ndisappointed Man lessen your good opinion of one whom you know to have\r\nbeen, early, decided, active, persevering and inflexible in the Cause\r\nof America? If this should be the prevailing Disposition, what honest\r\nMan will be safe? The consistent Patriot, after having endurd Fatigue &\r\nDanger for the Establishment of publick Liberty, would find himself\r\nstill in the greatest Perils among his own Countrymen. I will say\r\nnothing decisively of Mr Dean at present; but I would assure you of one\r\nthing, that were I connected with Dr Lee as a publick Man, and\r\nconscious of my own Tardiness, I should think I had every thing to\r\napprehend, not from a peevish, fretful Temper with which interrested\r\nMen have attempted to stigmatize him, but from his stern Virtue and\r\nRepublican Jealousy. I may be partial to Dr Lee. I confess I feel the\r\nstrongest Obligation to him, for the eminent Services he renderd to\r\nAmerica when he was in England, and to the Massachusetts Bay in\r\nparticular. I hope my Countrymen are not all ungrateful. Some of them,\r\nI have been taught to believe are so; otherwise the publick Character\r\nof an old Servant would not have been aspersd, nor wd it have been\r\nsaid, as I am informd it has, that he had been bribd to desert his\r\nCountry. It is his honorable Lot to have Enemies. Honorable, because he\r\nflatters himself his Enemies are among the weak & the wicked. I leave\r\nmy own Character, under God, in the Care of my virtuous fellow\r\nCitizens. I will contend for Dr Lees, because I am his Friend; and I am\r\nhis friend, because I have long had abundant Reason to be convincd that\r\nhe is a Friend to our Country. I have said I may be thought partial to\r\nhim. Be pleasd then to take the Testimony of another, and show it to\r\nhis Friends and his Enemies. \"Your old friend, says one, is a Man of\r\nHonor and Integrity.\" \"He has been of opinion that the publick Monies\r\nhave been too freely issued here, & has often opposd it.\" Let me remark\r\nhere that it is no Wonder he has exposd himself to the Resentment of a\r\nMan thro whose hands the Chief of the money passed. \"Insinuations, I\r\nhave been told, have been made at Court against your old friend that he\r\nwas too friendly to the English, too much attachd to Ld Shelburne &\r\neven that he corresponded with his Lordship & communicated Intelligence\r\nto him. This, whoever suggested it, I am perfectly confident was a\r\ncruel Calumny. You and I have had opportunity to know his invariable\r\nAttachment to our Cause long before Hostilities commencd & I have not a\r\nColor of Ground for Suspicion that from that time to this he has\r\ndeviated from the Cause of his Country in Thought Word or Deed.\"\r\n\r\nYou may tell the Friends of Virtue and Liberty, that the Letter from\r\nwhich the foregoing Extracts are taken was written to me by one in whom\r\nthey have always very justly placed great Confidence. I could\r\ntranscribe more Passages which mention Dr Lee as \"a worthy Character,\"\r\nthe unwarrantable Lengths to which the Animosities of interrested Men\r\nhave been carried against him, & the Inveteracy of many Subaltern &\r\ncollateral Characters but I think I have given enough to satisfy every\r\nreasonable Man.\r\n\r\nAdieu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers. Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADA Mar 23 1779\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BETSY\r\n\r\nIn Answer to a part of yours of the 20th of Feb. which I overlookd, I\r\nwill transcribe an Extract of a Letter which I wrote last December to\r\nthe Council of Massachusetts State. You may show it to my Friends &\r\ninform that I am still determind to return to Boston in April or\r\nMay--there to resign the place I hold as Secretary and to get my self\r\nexcusd from any further Service here. No \"Bribe\" shall prevail on me to\r\ndesert my Country. I will still exert my poor Abilities in her Service.\r\nBut as I am satisfied that there are others who are much more capable\r\nof serving her in this Department than I am, I may be allowd to say,\r\nthat after near five years absense from my Family, and in a Climate\r\nunfriendly to my Health. I have Reason to expect I may be permitted to\r\nspend the Remainder of my Days in my native Place and enjoy the\r\nPleasures of domestick Life. There, I shall on all occasions contribute\r\nmy Mite in promoting the Peace and Prosperity of my fellow Citizens. In\r\ntheir Service, I began my political Race. I have ever kept their\r\nInterest in View. It will never be in my Power to render them much more\r\nService; but my best Wishes for them will be coequal with my Life.\r\n\r\nI do not think my Countrymen are ungrateful; but I am affraid there is\r\na Faction among them, consisting of a few Men, who are under the\r\nDominion of those Passions which have been the Bane of Society in all\r\nAges--Ambition and Avarice. I wish their Number may not increase. They are\r\ncongenial Spirits with Hutchinson and those who aimd at grasping Wealth\r\nand Power. America, when she was wise, was jealous of such Designs. She\r\nopposd them though they were backd with the Wealth and Power of Great\r\nBritain. Such Kind of Men do me great Honor as they ever have done in\r\nbeing my Enemies. While such Men exist, and I believe they ever will in\r\nthis World of Vanity, an honest Man would feel mortified indeed, to\r\nhave it said that all Men spoke well of him. These Men hate, but I\r\nwould not believe them if they were to say, they despisd the Man whose\r\nIntegrity they cannot shake. They dread, but they cannot despise him of\r\nwhom they entertain an opinion, that he is a virtuous Citizen.--I do not\r\ncovet their Esteem. They are not among the Multitude of my Brethren, of\r\nwhom I should count it an Honor to be accepted. The Eclat of the World\r\nis Vanity. There is a solid Satisfaction in ones having, and being\r\nconscious that he merits the good opinion of Men of true Discernment\r\nand real Worth. But to have a Name among the weak and the wicked is\r\nShame and Reproach. Adieu my Dear. I hope to see you shortly, and then\r\nI will explain to you why I have written in this Strain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES WARREN.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADE  March 23 1779\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nI am to acknowledge the Receipt of your Favor of the 12th & 28th of\r\nFeby. The Letter you mention in the former came to hand, but I am apt\r\nto think it will have no Effect at all. There was an omission in the\r\nNavy Boards not having Notice officially of the inclosd Resolution of\r\nCongress, but I hope the Delay has not been attended with any material\r\nInconvenience.\r\n\r\nI do sincerely hope the General Assembly will appoint another Person to\r\ntake my place here. I wrote a Letter to them last December, requesting\r\nthat I might be relievd by one of my absent Colleagues or some other\r\nGentleman, & permitted to return to my Family in the Spring. I find my\r\nHealth declining, and the Air of this Country is unfriendly to it. I am\r\ntherefore steadfastly determind to get my self excusd in April or May\r\nat farthest. In doing this, I shall immediately make Room for an abler\r\nMan. Such may easily be found, and, I hope, prevaild upon to come. I\r\nshall also gratify those whose Hearts are bent upon my Removal, and\r\nshall save them Abundance of Pains in making their Interest to effect\r\nit. These Men agree with me, if in Nothing else, in wishing most\r\ncordially for my Retirement from publick Business. Perhaps they would\r\nchuse to have me recalled with Disgrace. I hope this is not in their\r\nPower; though I think I could bear even that with becoming Fortitude,\r\nfor I am conscious that I do not deserve to be disgracd by my Country,\r\nand can be happy in the Reflections of my own Mind. The Arts they make\r\nuse of are contemptible. Last year, as you observe, I was an Enemy to\r\nGeneral Washington. This was said, to render me odious to the People.\r\nThe Man who fabricated the Charge did not believe it himself. When he\r\nendeavord to make others believe it, he attempted to injure me by\r\nimposing upon them. His own Heart must therefore reproach him with\r\ncomplicated Acts of Injustice, and if he has any Feeling he must\r\ndespise himself. If I indulgd the Spirit of Revenge, could I wish for\r\nmore? NOW, you tell me, their Art is, to prejudice the People against\r\nthe Lees, and propagate that I am a Friend to them. HOW trifling is\r\nthis? Am I accountable to the People for my opinions of Men? If I have\r\nfound from long & intimate Acquaintance with those Gentlemen, that they\r\nare, and have been from the Beginning of this Contest, among the most\r\nable & zealous Defenders of the Rights of America and Mankind, shall I\r\nnot be their Friend? I will avow my Friendship to them in the Face of\r\nthe World. As an Inhabitant of Massachusetts Bay, I should think my\r\nself ungrateful, not to esteem Arthur Lee most highly, for his\r\nvoluntary Services to that State, in Times of her greatest Necessity,\r\nto the Injury of his private Interest, and at the Risque of his Life.\r\n\r\nAdieu my Friend.\r\n\r\nMarch 24--79\r\n\r\nThe Bearer of this Letter being prevented setting off by a Storm, I\r\nhave had Time to transcribe the inclosd Extracts. They were written to\r\nme, as you will observe, in Confidence. I think I am warranted in\r\ncommunicating them to you, because I know the Writer has as much\r\nConfidence in your Prudence & Discretion as in mine, if not more. And I\r\ndo not see how I can better use them for the purpose he intended in\r\nsending them to me, than by sending them to you. The Parts which are\r\ndescriptive of the Weakness, or if you think more proper, the reserved\r\nCaution of Age, you will judge prudent to keep secret for the present.\r\nThere are some of our Friends, who, having so long habituated\r\nthemselves to admire the Wisdom of the Philosopher cannot easily be\r\nperswaded to believe, that in the different Character of a Politician,\r\nhe may be liable to human Frailties at the Age of more than three score\r\nand ten. Those Parts which may serve to set Dr Lee in his true\r\nCharacter of an honest & diligent Servant of the publick, you will make\r\nUse of for that Purpose. For it is of equal Importance that the\r\nFidelity of one or the Treachery of another, in the service of the\r\npublick, should be made known. A Man of inflexible Republican Virtue\r\ncannot but incur both the Dread & the Hatred of those who\r\nare--ambitious--desirous of making Fortunes--artful and enterprizing--especially if\r\nmuch of the publick Money has passd, unaccounted for, through their\r\nHands. Mr Dean would have the World believe that Dr Lee is a dishonest\r\nMan & a Traitor. The Writer of these Extracts, who has had full\r\nOpportunity of enquiring, says, he is \"a Man of Integrity and Honor,\"--\"a\r\nworthy Character\"--\"invariably attachd to the Cause of America.\" I am\r\ninclind to think, that no honest & sensible Man who is acquainted with\r\nboth will hesitate to determine, which of their Opinions to rely upon,\r\nor which of them in the present Case ought to be supposd the impartial\r\nJudge.\r\n\r\nAdieu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES LOVELL.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nMarch 26\r\n\r\nMess Otis and Henley are under a Difficulty which I wish mt have your\r\nAttention, and that you wd consult our Brother Mr Gerry to whom they\r\nhave written on the Subject. In Consequence of the most pressing\r\nLetters from the Board of War, they have lately purchasd a Quantity of\r\nWoolen Goods at 5 Months Credit, to be paid for in Currency at 75 for\r\none provided Bills on Europe continue at 25, otherwise is that\r\nProportion. They consulted the most judicious and publick spirited\r\nMerchants upon Change who thought it an advantageous Bargain. But the\r\nBoard of War in a Letter to them say they hope & expect they have got\r\nrid of the Bargain. To insist upon this would seem hard and unjust, and\r\nto leave the Matter to be settled at a distant Time would be precarious\r\nand unsafe for them. I hope Gentlemen with you do not look upon them as\r\nthat Kind of Men who seek publick Employment without any View of\r\nserving the Publick. They are Men of Honor and Reputation; and as such\r\nthey expect to fullfil the Contracts they make, and they ought to be\r\nsupported by their Employers.\r\n\r\nA Prize is arrivd in Salem taken by one of our Privateers, said to have\r\non board 1500 bls of Flour, 1400 bls of Beef and Pork, besides dry\r\nGoods.\r\n\r\nMrs A made a Visit to Mrs L a day or two ago & informd me that your\r\nFamily were in Health. They are shortly to move into the House of S\r\nWaterhouse an Absentee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES LOVELL.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nMar 27\r\n\r\nThe Gentn of the Medical Departmt have diverse Times applied to\r\nCongress for Consideration on Accot of the depreciating Currency. It\r\nappears to me that they are as much intitled to it, as the officers of\r\nthe Line; for altho they may not run Risques in the fighting Way, they\r\nvery probably do, equally, in the Midst of putrid Fevers &c. Those of\r\nthem who are the Subjects of this State, have applied to the General\r\nAssembly; and tho ample Provision is made for officers & Soldiers, no\r\nProvision is made for them, because they are not considerd as Part of\r\nthe Quota of this State. I wish you would take this Matter under your\r\nConsideration. This is the first Time I have ever interposd in behalf\r\nof that Department. I have hitherto refraind on Account of my Sons\r\nbeing one, whom I early cautiond not to expect any Advantage, as a\r\nServant of the Publick from his Connection with me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES LOVELL.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nMarch 30\r\n\r\nCapt Paul Jones, it is supposd may be now in Philadelphia in Command of\r\nthe Alliance. If Congress will recollect the Mannagemt of the Cutter\r\nRevenge commanded by Cunningham, which I imagine has not been cleard up\r\nto this Day & probably never will be, they will think it just to the\r\nPublick and necessary that Enquiry shd be made, while Jones is on the\r\nSpot, concerning the Squadron lately under his Command. Whether it was\r\nfitted out at the Expence of the Publick either french or american or\r\njoyntly by both. Or whether it was a Project of private Men so artfully\r\ncontrivd & conducted as that they can declare the property to be either\r\npublick or private as may best suit their Interest. Landais is esteemd\r\nhere a good Commander & an honest Man. But he is left in France &\r\ncannot inform you any thing about it. And whether the Character which\r\nJones has given to all his officers (Landais only excepted) may operate\r\nas a Bribe, may be worth your particular Vigilance. The Reputation of\r\nour Navy, to say Nothing of the Honor of Congress which ought never to\r\nbe suspected, will suffer, if our Seamen, after having venturd their\r\nLives in cruizing upon the Enemy in Europe should return to America\r\nwithout receiving their Prize Money, & be told [here] that no one\r\nknows, whether the Vessels into which they inlisted were publick or\r\nprivate Property, tho they were taught to believe in Europe they were\r\nownd & commissiond by the United States. If [our] Ministers or Agents\r\nabroad either with or without special Direction of Congress shall think\r\nit proper to employ our Ships of War (which has been the Case of the\r\nAlliance at least) in Expeditions or Services in Europe, ought they not\r\nto be directed, when the Service is performd, if it cannot be done\r\nconveniently before, to make known the Circumstances & Events to\r\nCongress? I am told that a Commodore Gillon has written a Letter to the\r\nlate Mr President Jay concerning the attaching the American Ship of War\r\nAlliance to \"an amphibious Squadron of french Cruizers, subjecting them\r\nto the Orders of Capt Paul Jones and giving Continental Commissions to\r\na Number of french men, who were put upon Court Martials on American\r\nCitizens.\" And it is apprehended this Information will be withheld from\r\nCongress, because, tho intended to be laid before them, it was not\r\nexpressly so desired.

You\r\nwill not I am sure, impute it to Inattention or Neglect. I have been\r\noften sick. I have been fatigud with Business, whereby I am become\r\ngreatly indebted to all my Friends in the Epistolary Way. Shortly I\r\nhope to see them when I shall make a satisfactory Apology. Upon what\r\nFoundation do they build their Hopes of Peace? Congress, they say, have\r\nreceivd great News. No such thing. There is Nothing I know of worth\r\nyour hearing which you have not already heard. Be not amusd by the\r\nTales of interrested Politicians, Speculators & Tories. A false Hope of\r\npeace in the Time of War does a World of Mischiefe. The latest & best\r\nAdvices I have seen mention Britain as breathing Nothing but Revenge.\r\nBesides, were we to expect serious Overtures, did a wise Nation ever\r\nremit; their Exertions at such a Juncture? I hope America will\r\npersevere in this glorious Struggle till she obtains what in Reason she\r\nought to insist upon This you will tell me is saying just Nothing at\r\nall Very true; and why should one speak when it is the Time to be\r\nsilent? At a proper time when I shall have the pleasure of seeing you,\r\nI will chat with you upon the Subject. Let me only ask you at present,\r\nIs not the Fishery as valueable to America & more so to old\r\nMassachusetts than the Tobacco Fields of the middle States or the Rice\r\nSwamps of the South?\r\n\r\nAsk my old Fd the Hon T C1 what he thinks of the pious Lord Dartmouth\r\nnow. Adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SAMUEL COOPER.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADE April 29, 1779\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND\r\n\r\nI have not yet acknowledgd your Favors of the 14th & 15th of March. The\r\nSubject of the former is of the last Importance. I have always been of\r\nOpinion that America would be in more Danger in the Point of coming to\r\nan Accommodation with Great Britain than in any Stage of the War.\r\nUnpracticd as we are in the Business of Treaties and perhaps too\r\nunsuspecting of the Intrigues of Courts, we may be led into Conventions\r\nwhich may put us into a State of Insecurity while we are nominally\r\nindependent. The Advice which some Persons would affect to give us not\r\nto insist upon too much, should be receivd with the greatest Caution.\r\nWhat do they mean by it, and how far wd they have us extend it? If we\r\nhad hearkned to such Advice in the Infancy of this Contest, we should\r\nhave submitted [to] Britain the Right of taxing us, & humbly\r\nsupplicated her to suspend the Exercise of it. In doing this we might\r\nhave prevented the Horrors of War, & have been her quiet Slaves. No\r\nTerms have yet been proposd by Britain. She possibly may offer them\r\nsoon, and her proposals possibly may be insidious & inadmissible. I do\r\nbelieve she is at this Moment employing her secret Emissaries to find\r\nout the Disposition of America & what would be her Ultimatum. Should\r\nnot the People then speak the Language which becomes them & assure her\r\nthat after so virtuous & successful a Struggle they are determind to\r\ndemand enough for the Purpose of securing their own internal & external\r\nHappiness. This is the Aim of the Revolution and the Extent of the\r\nWishes of our good & great Ally, who I dare affirm, is invariably\r\ndetermind not to seperate his Interest from that of America, & to\r\nsupport the Cause of the United States as his own. Our Happiness\r\ndepends upon Independence. To be prosperous we must have an extensive\r\nTrade. This will require a respectable Navy. Our Ships must be mannd,\r\nand the Source of Seamen is the Fishery. Among those who ought to see\r\nthe Importance of the Fishery, I am affraid there are some who think\r\nthat in insisting upon that we should insist upon too much. Nova Scotia\r\n& Canada would be a great & permanent Protection to the Fishery. But\r\nthese, say some, are not Parts of the United States, and what Right\r\nshould we have to claim them? The Cession of those Territories would\r\nprevent any Views of Britain to disturb our Peace in future & cut off a\r\nSource of corrupt British Influence which issuing from them, might\r\ndiffuse Mischiefe and Poison thro the States. Will not then the\r\nPossession of Nova Scotia & Canada be necessary, if we mean to make\r\nPeace upon pacifick Principles? If we are to have no overtures this\r\nyear, and Providence blesses us with the Spirit of Enterprize would it\r\nnot be better for us, provided it be practicable, to wrest those Places\r\nfrom the Hands of the Enemy than trust to the Uncertainty of Treaty? I\r\nconfess we have a Choice of Difficulties. I pray God we may surmount\r\nthem all! None however reach the Pinnacle of Eminence & Glory but the\r\nvirtuous & brave. Adieu my dear Sir. I hope to see & live with you\r\nshortly; but I shall expect another Letter from you before I leave this\r\nPlace.\r\n\r\n1 Thomas Cushing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MARINE COMMITTEE OF THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS TO GEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n[MS., Letter Book of the Marine Committee, Library of Congress; a draft\r\nis in the Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nMay 26th 1779\r\n\r\nSIR\r\n\r\nYour Excellencys Letter to this committee of the 25th instant together\r\nwith an Extract from another of the 17th instant to the President of\r\nCongress has been duely considered by the Committee.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the situation of our frigates is such as to afford no\r\nreason to expect that they can possibly be collected in season to\r\nexecute the plan proposed. The Providence of 32 Guns and the Ranger of\r\n18 are already ordered on a Cruize and it is supposed must be at Sea\r\nbefore different orders can reach them at Boston.\r\n\r\nThe Warren of 36 Guns and the Queen of France of 20 have lately\r\nreturned from a Cruize and are unmanned. Although the Naval force of\r\nthe enemy at New York is at present trifleing, yet as their situation\r\nin this respect is very fluctuateing they may probably be so reinforced\r\nas to render it too hazardous to risque only the Two frigates in this\r\nRiver viz: the Confederacy of 36 Guns & the Deane of 28 Guns the latter\r\nof which wants a great number of hands to make up her complement.\r\n\r\nAdd to this that though the force of the enemy on the water would be\r\ninferior to ours, yet might they not retire under cover of the\r\nBatteries on shore and receive effectual protection from any annoyance\r\nthat could be attempted from the Guns of our small Ships. I am desired\r\nby the Committee to assure you Sir that they shall always be ready with\r\nthe greatest alacrity to employ our little fleet in the execution of\r\nsuch plans as may be suggested to them by your Excellency when our\r\ncircumstances shall be such as to render it practicable.\r\n\r\nI am yr Excellencys\r\n\r\nObet Servt 1\r\n\r\n1 Signed, \"S.

H. Lee, Life of Arthur Lee, vol. ii., pp. 226-228, under date of\r\nAugust 1, 1777.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON, Aug. 1st, 1779.\r\n\r\nIt was not till the last week that I received your favour from Nantes\r\nof the 6th of March. Our friend Mr. Lovett sent it to me from\r\nPhiladelphia. I resent the treatment you have met with in America with\r\nall the feelings of friendship. Among your enemies you may depend upon\r\nit there are some of the worst kind of men. I cannot help entertaining\r\na violent suspicion that they are the enemies of their country. I am\r\nsure that they cannot at present do a more vital injury to the great\r\ncause of America than by raising the popular jealousy and clamour\r\nagainst its earliest, most able, and persevering friends. This they are\r\nendeavouring to do not only with regard to you but others; and they are\r\nmasters of so much sophistry as to deceive some who, as I think, are\r\nnot so wary and suspicious of them as they ought to be. Mr. -------- in the opinion\r\nof some of his own party, was injudicious in his publication of the 5th\r\nDec. last. They are at least constrained to say it, whether they think\r\nso or not. It is the opinion of the best men, I know, that he has done\r\nmore mischief than it will ever be in his power to atone for. I never\r\nhad but one opinion of this man since the year 1774, when I first knew\r\nhim, and that is, that he is commercial and interested. I believe he\r\nhas for a twelvemonth past, thought it his interest to throw us into\r\ndivisions and parties, and that he has been as influential in effecting\r\nit as any man in America. Interested men, men who are united in\r\npolitics and commercial combinations are and must be his advocates.\r\nPerhaps the persons whose names you mention in the last part of your\r\nletter, may be his secret but powerful supporters; I do not pretend to\r\naffirm it. These men most certainly, should preserve their minds free\r\nfrom prejudice in disputes of this kind. They should stand totally\r\nunconnected with any party, as they would avoid doing injury to the\r\njoint cause of France and America, and lessening that strong attachment\r\nand mutual confidence between the two nations, which every true friend\r\nand subject of both wishes may long subsist.\r\n\r\nYour letter to the editor of the Leyden Gazette, written upon your\r\nseeing Mr.....'s first publication, fell into my hands a fortnight ago.\r\nI published it with a few loose observations in one of our newspapers.\r\nI have since had the pleasure of being informed, that you have sent to\r\ncongress a reply to Deane's accusations, which has given great\r\nsatisfaction to impartial men. I foresaw soon after his arrival, that\r\nyour lot would be to suffer persecution for a while. This is frequently\r\nthe portion of good men, but they are never substantially injured by\r\nit. Our friend and your late colleague, in his letter to me, has\r\nmentioned you in the most honourable as well as the most friendly\r\nterms. I should have written to him by this opportunity, but I am led\r\nby yours to believe that my letter would not reach him. But if he\r\nshould be in France when you receive this letter, pray mention my\r\nfriendly regards to him, and let him know that his lady and family are\r\nin health.\r\n\r\nThe young gentleman who carries this letter is Mr. William Knox,\r\nbrother to the general, and has the character of an honest friend to\r\nthe liberties of his country; your kind notice of him as such will\r\noblige me.\r\n\r\nI have many things to say to you; but the short notice I have had of\r\nthe sailing of this packet, leaves me no time to add more than to\r\nassure you that I am, with perfect sentiments of friendship, yours, &c.\r\n\r\n1 President of the Council of New Hampshire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SOLOMON LOVELL.1\r\n\r\n[MS., Massachusetts Archives.]\r\n\r\nAugust 6th 1779\r\n\r\nSIR/\r\n\r\nThe Council not having receivd any Intelligence of the State of the\r\nArmy under your Command since your Departure from Boston, are\r\napprehensive that it must have been unluckily intercepted.

He, with his usual Readiness to serve the\r\nCommon Cause, has spared Colo Jacksons Regt to joyn our Forces at\r\nPenobscot. They were marchd to this place with the greatest Dispatch &\r\nhave sailed with a fair Wind, under Convoy of two Vessels of Force. It\r\nneeds not to be mentiond to you, how necessary it is to remove the\r\nEnemy from their Lodgment there. I cannot but hope the Business is by\r\nthis Time effected; but should any untoward Accident happen, a Regiment\r\nof regular Troops will support our Militia, and animate that Part of\r\nthe Country. Our last Accounts from General Lovel were of the 6th\r\nInstant. There was then no unpromising Circumstance, but the Want of a\r\nfew disciplind Soldiers. We had a Letter from Mr Freeman of Falmouth,\r\ndated I think the 12th, by which we were informd that one Pote, a\r\nfisherman... While I am writing, an Express arrives from Penobscot with\r\nLetters of the 13th--a Reinforcement to the Enemy consisting of 1 Ship of\r\n64 Guns 3 Frigates...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HENRY JACKSON.1\r\n\r\n[MS., Massachusetts Archives.]\r\n\r\nSTATE OF MASS.

They approve of your Resolution to march to Falmouth, and make\r\nno doubt but upon your Application to the People of Portsmouth, or as\r\nit appears to the Council most effectual, to the Selectmen of the Towns\r\nEastward of Portsmouth, you will be amply provided with Waggons &c for\r\nthe Transportation of your Baggage Provisions & military Stores. By the\r\ntime of your Arrival at Falmouth, you will probably receive Directions\r\nfor your further Conduct from Brigr Genl Lovel who is authorizd, if he\r\nshall judge it necessary, to call in the Militia of the Counties of\r\nYork Cumberland & Lincoln. It is expected that so spirited, experiencd\r\nand well Disciplind a Regiment as yours is, will add Vigor to the\r\nInhabitants of that Part of the State, upon whose Attachment to the\r\nCause of their Country great Dependence is to be had. A single\r\nDisappointment though attended with LOSS should by no means be a\r\nDiscouragement to us. It is hoped that a respectable Body of the\r\nMilitia will be again collected, at such place as Genl Lovel if\r\nnecessary shall think most convenient, and that by the Smiles of Heaven\r\nour Enemies in that Quarter will yet be subdued.

By the Councils\r\nLetter which you must have receivd, you will see that Events untoward\r\nhave taken place at Penobscot. Our Troops were dispersd, and I fear our\r\nShips are burnt. Better so, however, than to fall into the Enemies\r\nHands. We could not command Success, but we have endeavord to deserve\r\nit. Disappointments are to be expected in so arduous a Conflict, and\r\nwhen they come fairly one can bear them with Patience & Fortitude; but\r\nwhen they happen through Misconduct, they are vexatious. I suspect\r\nthere has been bad Mannagement, but I will not make up my Judgment till\r\nI am fully informd. The Moment an authentick & explicit Account\r\narrives, you shall have it from me. I will not yet despair of Success.\r\nWitness Tyconderoga & Saratoga. An Instance which you and our Country\r\nwill never forget. We have directed & authorizd Genl Lovel to call in\r\nthe Militia & have sent him a Proclamation to disperse thro the Eastern\r\nCounties. Who knows but Laurels are yet ordaind for Level & Jackson. He\r\narrivd on fryday last with the whole Fleet under his Command at\r\nPortsmouth, and is to march through a good Road to Falmouth where he\r\nwill probably receive Lovels orders. The Selectmen & Committees of the\r\nTowns are directed to provide him with Waggons to transport his Baggage\r\nProvisions & military Stores. I flatter myself we shall yet subdue the\r\nEnemy at Penobscot. To alleviate our Misfortunes, some Ships taken from\r\nthe Jamaica Fleet by the Providence Queen of France & Ranger are arrivd\r\nat this Harbor which added to one arrivd here a few Days ago & another\r\nat Cape Ann makes six out of ten which we know are taken. The Contents\r\nof all are fifteen or sixteen hundred hhds of Sugar, twelve hundred\r\nhhds of Rum, Piemento, Ginger, Fish &c. The richest of the Cargos are\r\narrivd. We are told of a Vessel at Salem in thirty Days from Cadiz &\r\nBilboa, which brings an Account of the Declaration of War in Spain\r\nagainst Britain. This corresponds with Accounts just recd from Havanna.\r\nI believe they are true.\r\n\r\nThe Chevalier de la Luzerne has honord me with several private\r\nconfidential Conversations, in which I have communicated to him my\r\nSentiments with Freedom and Candor. I have conceivd an high opinion of\r\nhim and of M. Marbois, who is a Member of the Parliament of Meitz. I\r\nwant him to see you & Governor Trumbull. The Chevalier has not yet\r\ndetermind what Route to take. Should he go thro Springfield I wish to\r\nknow whether you could furnish him with an Escort to General\r\nWashingtons Head Quarters. Your Answer to this speedily will oblige\r\nme.--God bless you my dear Friend. Believe me to be sincerely yours----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n[MS., Massachusetts Archives; the text, dated November 12, 1779, is in\r\nW.V.

I have venturd to promise the People the Service of that Ship\r\nupon the Assurance given to me by your Honbl Board. I beg you would not\r\nthink my Design is to be troublesome to you, but you will excuse me in\r\npressing a Matter in which I think I am justified, by the Rules of\r\nJustice, & Mercy to a Community whose Constancy & Firmness as well as\r\nSufferings in the great Cause entitle them to the Protection of the\r\nContinental Navy.\r\n\r\nI am with every Sentiment of Regard\r\n\r\nGentn yr very hbl Servt\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ELBRIDGE GERRY AND JAMES LOVELL.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nDecr -- 1779\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN\r\n\r\nMr Woodbury Langdon1 did me the Honor of a Visit this Morning and\r\ndeliverd to me your Letter of the 19th of November directed to Mr\r\nHancock and myself.\r\n\r\nI cannot but feel the Sentiments of Gratitude to the Gentleman who has\r\noriginated a Subscription for the Support of the Children of our very\r\nworthy deceasd Friend. I had been informd of it before; having lately\r\nseen a Letter on the Subject, in which the Name of Congress is mentiond\r\nin Terms more than \"inadvertent.\" I am much displeasd, when I find the\r\ntender Feelings of Humanity & Benevolence towards these helpless\r\nOrphans accompanied with the Passion of Anger, and Resentment (probably\r\nmisplacd) towards that Body, which their \"brave Father,\" if living,\r\nwould not fail to honor & revere. I should be very sorry, that the\r\n\"various Causes\" in one Paper, should be explaind by the harsh\r\nExpressions of \"Ingratitude that is unparralled [sic],\" in another. I\r\nhave never heard that Application has been made to the Assembly of\r\nMassachusetts Bay in Behalf of these Children; and if there had been, I\r\nam at a LOSS to conceive, from what good or generous Motives it was\r\nintroducd into a Paper when the very Use of it must tend to expose &\r\nexclude them from the Character of \"patriotick humane & generous.\" Nor\r\ncan I readily think of a Reason, why the Monies to be collected, should\r\nnot be paid into the Hands of one of the Massachusetts Delegates, since\r\nit would not then have conveyd the Idea in a strong Light, that those\r\nwho had been formerly among the most intimate Acquaintance and\r\naffectionate Friends of their \"illustrious Ancestors,\" were totally\r\nregardless of \"what they owe to his deserted youth.\"\r\n\r\nI will communicate your Letter to Mr Hancock and consult him thereon.\r\nIn the mean Time be assured that I am sincerely\r\n\r\nYour Friend,\r\n\r\n1 Member of Congress from New Hampshire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ELBRIDGE GERRY.\r\n\r\n[J. T. Austin, Life of Elbridge Gerry, vol. i., pp. 310, 311.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON, Dec. 20, 1779.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nLast Saturday the two houses of assembly of this state made choice of\r\nyourself and Mr. Osgood to represent them in the convention recommended\r\nby the joint committees of the five eastern states to be held at\r\nPhiladelphia. As it was a doubt in the minds of some of the members,\r\nwhether so many of the other states would send their agents as to make\r\na convention, it was thought prudent to leave it to the gentlemen who\r\nrepresent this state in congress, to agree upon any two of their number\r\nfor that service. But it was overruled for several reasons; one was,\r\nthat it was necessary to send one gentleman at least, immediately from\r\nhence, because it was supposed such an one must be better acquainted\r\nwith particular circumstances in this state, necessary to be made known\r\nto that assembly, and which are perpetually varying, than any gentleman\r\ncould be who has been absent for any length of time. Some gentlemen\r\nwere 10th you should be taken off a moment from your important services\r\nin congress, but all were desirous of your assistance in the\r\nconvention, in case it shall meet. Mr. Osgood will set off with all\r\npossible speed.\r\n\r\nI am with truth and sincerity,\r\n\r\nYour affectionate friend,\r\n\r\nTO ELBRIDGE GERRY AND JAMES LOVELL.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON Decr 20th 1779\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN/\r\n\r\nSince my last Letter to you, I have had an Opportunity of conversing\r\nwith Doctor John Warren,1 Brother of our deceasd Friend, concerning the\r\nScituation of his Children. He tells me that the eldest Son was, as\r\nearly as it could be done, put under the Care and Tuition of the Revd\r\nMr Payson of Chelsea; a Gentleman whose Qualifications for the\r\ninstructing of Youth, I need not mention to you. The Lad still remains\r\nwith him. The eldest Daughter, a Miss of about thirteen, is with the\r\nDoctor; and he assures me, that no Gentlemans Dauter in this Town has\r\nmore of the Advantage of Schools than she has at his Expence. She\r\nlearns Musick, Dancing, writing & Arithmetick, and the best Needle Work\r\nthat is taught here. The Doctor, I dare say, takes good Care of her\r\nMorals. The two younger Children, a Boy of about seven years, and a\r\nGirl somewhat older, are in the Family of John Scollay Esqr, under the\r\nparticular Care of his Daughter at her most earnest Request; otherwise,\r\nI suppose, they would have been taken Care of by their Relations at\r\nRoxbury, and educated as reputable Farmers Children usually are. Miss\r\nScollay deserves the greatest Praise for her Attention to them. She is\r\nexceedingly well qualified for her Charge; and her Affection for their\r\ndeceas'd Father prompts her to exert her utmost to inculcate in the\r\nMinds of these Children, those Principles which may conduce, \"to render\r\nthem worthy of the Relation they stood in\" to him. General Arnold has\r\nassisted, by generously ordering five hundred Dollars towards their\r\nSupport. This I was informd of when I was last in Philadelphia. I\r\ncalled on him & thank'd him for his Kindness to them. Whether he has\r\ndone more for them since, I cannot say. Probably he originated the\r\nSubscription2 you have mentiond to me. I have omitted to tell you, that\r\ntwo years ago I was in this Town and made a visit to the present\r\nGeneral Warren at Plymouth. His Lady was very sollicitous that the\r\neldest Daughter should spend that Winter with her, and desired me to\r\npropose it to Miss. I did so; but I could not prevail upon her. She\r\nsaid, that Mrs Miller (Mr Charles Millers Lady) at whose House she then\r\nwas, did not incline to part with her, and that it would be a Breach of\r\ngood Manners, and ungrateful for her to leave Mrs Miller against her\r\nInclination. She very prettily expressd her Obligations to both those\r\nLadies, and thus prevented my saying any more. I am very certain it was\r\nMrs Warrens Intention to give her Board and Education. You know the\r\ndistinguishd Accomplishments of that Lady. I think it does not appear\r\nthat Betsy has been altogether friendless and \"deserted\"; or that the\r\nothers are in danger of \"suffering irreparably on Account of their\r\nEducation.\" Yet as I am very desirous that they should have the\r\ngreatest Advantage in their Growth into Life, I shall, among other\r\nFriends, think my self much obligd to any Gentleman who, from pure and\r\nunmixd Motives, shall add to those which they now enjoy.\r\n\r\nI have not yet had the Honor of an Interview with Mr Hancock, since I\r\nsent him the Letter which you wrote to us joyntly, and requested his\r\nSentiments thereon. Adieu, my dear Friends, and believe me to be\r\nrespectfully\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\n1 Numerous bills of John Warren against the United States, for the\r\nexpenses of the education of Joseph Warren, are in the Massachusetts\r\nArchives.\r\n\r\n2 The text of this subscription, from an autograph copy by Adams in the\r\nLenox Library, is printed below, pages 171-173.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOPY OF A SUBSCRIPTION PROPOSD FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE CHILDREN OF THE\r\nLATE MAJOR GENERAL WARREN--DATED AT PHILADELPHIA; & INCLOSD IN A LETTER\r\nFROM E. GERRY & JAMES LOVELL TO JOHN HANCOCK & SAMUEL ADAMS.\r\n\r\nThe Honble Major General Warren who after de voting his Time & Talents\r\nfor many years to his Country, gloriously fell in defending her Rights\r\n& Liberties, in the well fought Battle of Bunkers Hill, left four\r\nOrphan Children--Minors, two Sons and two Daughters--who from his Attention\r\nto the great & common Cause of these States, were left unprovided for\r\nand who on his Death found themselves without Parents, or the Means of\r\nSupport.\r\n\r\nThe Honble Congress has resolvd to be at the Expence of the Education\r\nof the Elder Son; the other Son and two Daughters remain to this Time\r\nwithout other Assistance than what some generous & charitable Persons\r\nhave afforded them. Application has been made to the Assembly of the\r\nMassachusetts Bay & in September last to Congress on the Subject; but\r\nthe Multiplicity of Business or other Causes have hitherto prevented\r\ntheir obtaining any Grant in their Favor--in the mean time the Children of\r\nthis patriotick Hero are suffering greatly on Account of their\r\nEducation, and unless speedily relievd must suffer irreparably. Nothing\r\nmore need be said on a Subject which every patriotick as well as humane\r\nand generous American must feel sensibly, on recollecting the Character\r\nand Death of their brave Father, to induce them to their Reliefe, &\r\nthereby to discharge some Part of what they owe the brave Father of\r\nthese deserted youth.\r\n\r\nWhatever Sums may be subscribd, will be receivd by the Honble the\r\nPresident of the Council of the State of Massachusetts Bay in Boston, &\r\nunder their Direction will be applied to the Support and Education of\r\nthese Children, in such a Manner as is becoming their Birth, and as\r\nwill tend to render them great and good Citizens, & worthy of the\r\nRelation they stand in, to their illustrious Ancestor.\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA Novr 1st 1779\r\n\r\nWe the Subscribers engage to pay the Sums affixd to our Names to the\r\nHonble William Paca Esqr l, to be transmitted to the President &\r\nCouncil aforesaid.

It is important; nor out of Season. It is most certainly\r\nincumbent on those who have accepted of Places of the highest Trust, to\r\nattend constantly to the Duties of their Stations. This is the just\r\nExpectation of the Publick & ought never to be dispensed with. The\r\nBoard have been so sensible of the obligations they owe to their\r\nCountry in this Regard, that they have frequently orderd a Call of\r\ntheir Members when it became necessary and previous to your Message\r\nthey directed the Attendance of those who are now absent.

V. Wells, Life of Samuel Adams, vol. iii., pp.\r\n98, 99]\r\n\r\nSTATE OF MASSACHUSETTS BAY Jany 5th 1780\r\n\r\nSIR\r\n\r\nThe General Assembly of this State, conceiving that great Evil may\r\narise to the United States, from permitting Persons inimical to our\r\nCommon Cause, to reside within them; And having Reason to apprehend,\r\nthat certain Persons who by an Act of Government have been excluded\r\nfrom this State, are meditating a Design to obtain a Residence in the\r\nState of Rhode Island, have thought it necessary to address you on the\r\nSubject, and to request that you would be pleasd to communicate their\r\nSentiments to your General Assembly.\r\n\r\nIt is, in the Opinion of this Assembly, highly criminal for a Citizen\r\nto be an indifferent Spectator of the Miseries of his Country -- much more\r\nso, to desert her while struggling for her Liberty -- and still more, to\r\nseek Refuge in the very Time of her Conflict in the Arms of her cruel &\r\ninveterate Enemies. It cannot then be thought strange, that those who\r\nlove and reverence their Country, feel an Indignation against the Men,\r\nwho have held her Safety, her Liberty & her Honor at so cheap a Rate.\r\n\r\nThe Injury which this State unavoidably sustaind from the Arts of too\r\nmany internal Enemies, hath been a sufficient Caution against receiving\r\ninto her own Bosom, those who have withdrawn their Persons and their\r\nAid in the Time of Danger & Distress; & there is less Reason for others\r\nto expect Favor and Forgiveness, who having basely betrayed such a\r\nDiffidence in the Wisdom and Fortitude of their Country and the\r\nrighteous Cause she is contending for, have imagind themselves more\r\nsecure, under the Power of its Invaders, and fled to them for\r\nProtection.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed much to be regretted, that the greatest Vigilance is\r\ninsufficient to detect the most virulent Enemies of the publick Liberty\r\nin every Instance, and bring them to condign Punishment. This\r\nGovernment, however, hath taken every Measure which Prudence dictated,\r\nto effect so necessary a Purpose. Notorious offenders have been\r\nproscribed by the Laws, and forbidden to return from their voluntary\r\nand shameful Exile. Mutual Interest as well as mutual Friendship most\r\nstrongly remonstrate against such Persons being permitted to reside\r\nwithin any of the Sister States. While we are embarkd in the same\r\nCause; While we are actuated by the same Principles and Views; While we\r\npartake of the same publick Feeling, and are confederated for the same\r\ngreat Purpose of mutual Safety and Defence; Honor and Justice forbid us\r\nto entertain a Suspicion, that the State of Rhode Island would afford\r\nShelter & Protection to those, who have forfeited the Rights of\r\nCitizens in the United States.\r\n\r\nIn the Name & Behalf of the General Assembly\r\n\r\nI am &c,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON Jany 13, 1780.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nI gladly embrace the first opportunity I have had of writing to you\r\nsince you left this Country. Mr Jonn Loring Austin is the Bearer of\r\nthis Letter. He is appointed by the General Assembly to negociate an\r\nAffair in Europe which will be communicated to you by a Letter written\r\nto you by the President of the Council & signd in their Name. The\r\nMeasure is the favorite offspring of the House of Representatives, &\r\nwas adopted by many Members of the Council. I wish it may succeed to\r\ntheir Expectation.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly has been sitting five or six Weeks, and it is probable\r\nwill rise tomorrow. Among other things, they have passed an Act for\r\nsecuring to their own officers & Soldiers in the Army of the United\r\nStates, a Compensation for the Depreciation of their pay. It is done in\r\na Mode agreeable to a Committee of officers from the Army, so that\r\nthere is no Doubt but the Rest of the officers & the Soldiers will be\r\nsatisfied with it. Money has been sent to the Army to inlist those\r\nwhose three years are expired, & who may be inclind to continue in the\r\nService, & we are well assured that great Numbers have engagd, so that\r\nthere is a good Prospect of our States Batallions being well filled.\r\nIndeed there is all imaginable Reason to expect that the General will\r\nbe furnishd in the Spring with an Army better disciplined than even\r\nthose which have provd their Superiority to the Enemy in several\r\nCampaigns. The more they are inured to actual Service, the more perfect\r\nthey will be in Discipline; and the Courage of a Soldier in the Time of\r\nAction, in a great Measure... from a confidence in his military\r\nKnowledge. What Events may take place in the Spring we cannot certainly\r\npredict. An Army we know will be necessary, either to fight the Enemy,\r\nor to give Assurance & Stability to the skillful Negociator of Peace.\r\nThe Plan you mentiond to me as having been proposd by you to Monsr -------- the\r\nlast October was a twelvemonth, if it could be fully accomplishd, might\r\nin one of the ways above mentiond or the other, secure to us the\r\nObjects which I know your heart is much set upon as well as mine.\r\nIndependence is a mere Charm, [and] unless by Arts or by Arms we secure\r\nto ourselves those Advantages we may not have the Fortitude to assert\r\nit as we ought, but by which alone we shall be enabled, under God, to\r\nmaintain it. You have the... , and for my self I confide both in your\r\nWisdom & Integrity.\r\n\r\nYou will see by the inclosd Paper that our Convention is adjournd. The\r\nRoads thro the Country are so blockd up by incessant & heavy Snows,\r\nthat it has been impracticable for the Members to attend. It is proposd\r\nto keep it alive by short Adjournments till a sufficient Number shall\r\narrive to proceed to the Business. Those among us who can remember the\r\nyear 1717 say there has not been so much Snow on the Ground since that\r\nTime.\r\n\r\nMr L informs me that Colo Laurens the younger has declind going to\r\nEurope. \"The little Gentleman\" (he will pardon me the Joke) will, if he\r\nrecollects, help us to guess who will probably obtain the next Choice.\r\n\r\nThe Delegates in Congress for the last year are again chosen excepting\r\nGeneral Ward in the Room of Mr Dana. I own it is not becoming an old\r\nMan to be mutable--and yet I am intimately acquainted with one who took\r\nhis Leave of his good Friends in Philadelphia with almost as much\r\nFormality as if he was on his dying Bed soon after resolving to visit\r\nthem once more. In [your] horrid Catalogue of evil Dispositions with\r\nwhich Age is infested we do not find Vanity. This perhaps may be common\r\nto the old & the young, tho I confess it is the more pardonable in the\r\nlatter. It is difficult for a Man in years to perswade himself to\r\nbelieve a mortifying Truth that the Powers of his mind whether they\r\nhave been greater or less, are diminishd.\r\n\r\nPray assure Mr Dana of my affectionate Regards, and Colo Laurens if you\r\nmeet with him. I am informd he is gone or going to Europe. My old\r\npatriotick Friend Mr A L, I am perswaded is before this time on his\r\nPassage to America. But if not, let him know that the Hopes of seeing\r\nhim at Philadelphia is a strong Inducement to me, otherwise against my\r\nInclination, to visit Philadelphia once more.\r\n\r\nA Letter from Genl Heath dated at Head Quarters Decr 21 says \"the\r\nhealth & Spirits of the Troops are not to be parralled. The Enemy at N\r\nY are undoubtedly embarking a large Body of Troops from 8 to 10,000--they\r\nwould have saild before this Time but have been under Apprehension that\r\nthe Coast was not clear.

I can conceive of no Reason why\r\nyou should not be servd with Copies as you desire. The Council have\r\norderd the papers to be lookd up for the Use of a Committee appointed\r\nto state our Claim. This will be done with the greatest Despatch, and\r\nwill enable me to convince you of the Readiness with which I am disposd\r\nto gratify you in all Cases consistent with the Duties of my office.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time I am with great Esteem &c\r\n\r\n1 Secretary of State of New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES LOVELL.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON Mar 5 1780\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nI have receivd since I last wrote, your 21st, 25th & 28th of Jany and\r\n8th & 16th of Feby, with the inclosd which I have distributed according\r\nto your Request. My Time has been spent for two Months past, partly in\r\nmy sick Chamber and partly in our Convention for forming a Constitution\r\nwhich we finishd yesterday for the Inspection of the People. You shall\r\nhave a Copy of it when it can be got thro the Press. Considering the\r\nWinter we have had and the utmost Impossibility of travelling, I am not\r\nso much surprizd at your Presidents not having receivd the Letters\r\nwhich have been sent from the General Assembly relating to Vermont. Mr\r\nAvery assures me that Duplicates were sent, so that I hope they have\r\nbefore this time got to hand. A Committee was appointed by the General\r\nAssembly to state our Right to the Land in Question, with an Intention\r\nthat our Agent mt be ready at Congress by the Time appointed, but on\r\ntheir representing that they should not be able to report at the last\r\nSession they were directed to do it at the next which will begin next\r\nWednesday. I will then endeavor to get the Number of our Delegates\r\nnecessary to be present in Congress reducd.\r\n\r\nI wish you would send your Account of Time & Expences to the Assembly.\r\nTwenty five Dollars pr Day and Expences were allowd to me for the year\r\n79. I inform you of this that you may judge whether the Allowance for\r\nTime & Service is raisd in Proportion to other things.\r\n\r\nIn your Letter of the 16 of Feb you mention your having inclosd to me\r\nthe Day before two Letters from Genl Lincoln, and your having had four\r\nsent to your Care. I have receivd only two, and them by Mr Torrey, one\r\nof them for the Generals Lady which I have forwarded by a safe hand,\r\nand the other for his Son.\r\n\r\n\"Our Newspapers are remarkeable lately for more groundless Paragraphs\r\nthan most others.\" It is true. And there are some Men who with all\r\nother political Qualities, cannot keep a political Secret. I thought it\r\nnot prudent to mention it, and did not to any one; but to my great\r\nSurprize saw it in one of the Papers. It was however a great Wonder, as\r\nI was told a paragraph of one of your own Letters was either read or\r\nexplaind in a large table Circle, and so it got into the Press. The\r\nIntelligence was far from being displeasing to any of your virtuous\r\nfellow Citizens, unless to those who think your Presence in Congress\r\nindispensible.\r\n\r\nIn the Hint I gave you in one of my Letters I was far from intending\r\nyou should think I meant Capt Mc Neil. I am sure he is a Man of too\r\nmuch Honor to write the anonimous Letter the Committee receivd.\r\n\r\nI hope the General Assembly when they come together will turn their\r\nAttention principally to the fitting up & supplying their Quota of the\r\nArmy.

Colo\r\nNiles informd me yesterday that your Lady & Family were well when he\r\nsaw them on Saturday last. Our General Assembly began a Session the\r\nlast Week. They are intent on filling up their Quota of the Army. The\r\nConvention is adjournd till the first Wednesday in June next.1 The\r\nFabrick is not materially injurd. It is proposd that the People should\r\nstate their Objections if they have any, and that the Convention shd\r\nadapt it to the General Sentiments & give it the Sanction--a New\r\nConvention to be called, if two thirds of the people shall think it\r\nexpedient in the year 95 to make Alterations as Experience may dictate.\r\nMr Appleton is the Son of our Friend the Loan Officer.

They\r\nimmediately appointed a Come to state their Claim, consisting of three\r\nGentle-men, two of whom viz Mr Bowdoin & Mr Lowell are not Members. The\r\ngreat Business of the Convention of which all the Come were Members\r\nintervened. Their Report however is expected in a very few Days. I wish\r\nthis Matter could be settled to the Satisfaction of all. If there was\r\nReason to expect that all would be satisfied with a Decision of\r\nCongress, I should think the sooner it is done the better. But the\r\nGrant People, you say, now refuse. It may be a Question then whether it\r\nwd be best to attempt a Settlement in the Time of War, and especially\r\nat a Juncture of it, when the only Object of all should be to prosecute\r\nit with their utmost united Force and Vigor. Nothing however but the\r\nMultiplicity of most pressing Affairs, has prevented this State being\r\nready hitherto. They are in Earnest to support their Claim. They were\r\ndiscontented with the Decision in 1739, and I think afterwards directed\r\ntheir Agent Mr Bollan to manifest it to the King in Council. I will\r\nexamine the Letters of that Day & make this certain to you. Ethan Allen\r\nwas in this Towne last Winter, and returnd disgusted on his being\r\ninformd that we were determined to support our Claim.\r\n\r\nThe Resolutions of Congress, a Sketch of which you sent to me, came to\r\nthe Council by the same Conveyance. The Assembly being sitting, they\r\nwere laid before them. Every practicable Measure is taking to promote\r\nthe great Business of recruiting the Army & every other Essential to a\r\nvigorous Campaign. I have noticed the honest Intention of ---- without\r\nfeeling any Jealousy on the Occasion. It is always my Endeavor to\r\nrender the recommendations of Congress most respectable; tho I\r\nperceive, that the artful Writers in some of the Philadelphia Papers\r\naffect to hold up a Contrast between the present & the \"illustrious\r\nCongress of '74\"--I may be supposd\r\n\r\n[to] be impartial, having had the Honor of being a Member from the\r\nBeginning; and I do verily believe that in point of Understanding,\r\nWisdom, Integrity, and Diligence in Affairs they are as respectable now\r\nas they were then. It is the Wish of Tories and Britons to make them\r\nappear little in the Eye of the World. Under God they have done\r\nWonders. By an affectionate Union of the Members with each other, by\r\ntheir joynt & unwearied application to the publick Business, by\r\nVigilance Zeal and an inflexible Independence of Spirit they will\r\ncontinue reverd by the Friends and dreaded by the Enemies of our\r\nCountry.\r\n\r\nI thank you for the Intelligence you inclosd, and have made a prudent\r\nUse of it, by communicating it to some of the leading members of the\r\nAssembly who are my confidential Friends. To others I have given it in\r\nmy own way as Articles of my political Creed, and I think to good\r\nEffect. What do you think of Penobscott? The late Expedition,1 tho it\r\nturnd out very unfortunate, was perhaps as great an Exertion as has\r\nbeen made by any State since the War began. Our State must demand a\r\nreimbursement. It is more than probable that if we had succeeded we shd\r\nhave had the Charge paid with thanks. And we shd have richly deserved\r\nit. Britain I doubt not considers that an important Post and so\r\nwill.... if she regards her Navy.\r\n\r\nYou know that by our Charter the Crown reservd the Masts. Another\r\nCircumstance I will.... remind you of, that part of our Eastern Country\r\nwas held by the Crown & the People of the Province as it were in joynt\r\nTenancy. He could not originate the Sale of any Part of it, nor could\r\nthey complete the sale without his Confirmation. Will it not be her\r\nPolicy to keep Possession of that part of our Territory till Terms of\r\nPeace are proposd, that she may take occasion to say she is in\r\nPossession of her own. And will it not then be somewhat difficult for\r\nMediator to find Arguments against her holding it? Should not Congress\r\nassist us in endeavoring to recover possession? We want Ships. If a\r\nfrench Squadron should again visit these Seas it is natural for a\r\nMassachusetts Man to wish, that they should make Hallifax their capital\r\nobject. Probably America wd think it for her Interest if she.... that\r\nthe Masts & the Fishing Ground must be the great Security of their\r\nIndependence & Prosperity? We must have the reach of our arms or we\r\nshall never be able even to defend ourselves....\r\n\r\nI declare to you I shall not feel perfectly easy till those two\r\nprovinces are annexed to the United States as Nature seems to have\r\ndesignd, and the unmolested Right to the Fishery is secured to us. I\r\nbelieve my letter is become tedious to you. I will conclude with\r\nmentioning that several Persons have hinted to me the Necessity of\r\nestablishing an American Consul in France. If it should be thought\r\nexpedient to propose it to Congress & they should judge it proper, Mr\r\nPerez Moulton2 (whom you know) desires me to inform the Mass Delegates\r\nthat he intends residing in that Country a few years & would gladly\r\naccept of that appointment.\r\n\r\n1 Cf.

I need to say Nothing to recommend him to your Patronage and\r\nAdvice. The Marquis La Fayette who tarried here a few Days ago did me\r\nthe Honor to deliver me your Favor of--------. The other to which you refer me is\r\nnot come to Hand. I enclose you several Acts of the General Assembly\r\npassed the last Session, besides which another passed granting to the\r\nSubjects of France within this State equal Privileges with those\r\ngranted to the Subjects of the United States in France agreable to the\r\nTreaty and another for instituting a Society for promoting Arts &\r\nSciences. The Suddeness of Mr Warrens Departure prevents my sending the\r\ntwo last by him. I also inclose the Form of the Constitution as revisd\r\n& alterd by the Convention and recommended to the People. The Town of\r\nBoston have been in Meeting three Days, upon this important Affair. It\r\nis this moment finishd. The Town have unanimously agreed to the\r\nConstitution with a few Alterations (I think for the better) except the\r\nthird Article. They have proposd that in the 16th Article of the\r\nDeclaration of Rights provision be made for the Liberty of Speech as\r\nwell as the Press, in both Cases to respect publick Men in their\r\npublick Conduct. In the Proviso under the 7 Article Chap. 2 they have\r\nadded to the Exception, so far as may be necessary for the Defence of a\r\nneighboring State invaded or threatned with immediate Invasion. In the\r\n7 Art. Chap. 6. the Words \"upon the most urgent & pressing Occasions\"\r\nare proposd to be expungd and the Words \"of War, Invasion or rebellion\r\ndeclard by the Legislature to exist\" to be inserted in their Stead. And\r\nthe Time is limitted to Six instead of 12 Months. The Religious Article\r\nwas considerd by itself, and occasiond much but candid Debate. The Town\r\nhave proposd a new Draft of the Article which I have not by me. If Mr\r\nWarren does not call on me too early tomorrow I will transcribe it. The\r\nConvention is adjournd to the 7th of June to receive & act upon the\r\nReturns of the People agreably to the Resolution of Convention inserted\r\nin the last pages of the inclosd, to which this Town has agreed. The\r\nshort Notice I have had of this opportunity & my being obligd to attend\r\nthe Town Meeting has prevented my writing so largely as I could have\r\nwishd. Please to present my affectionate Regards to Mr Dana & let him\r\nknow that I receivd his Letter by the Marquis, & that Attention will be\r\ngiven to his request for certain papers of Importance. I shall set off\r\nfor Philade in a few Days. Adieu my dear Sir.\r\n\r\nI wrote you by Mr J. L. Austin who I hope is arrivd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE SIGNED \"VINDEX.\"\r\n\r\n[Boston Gazette, June 12, 1780.]\r\n\r\nMessieurs Edes,\r\n\r\nAn old Correspondent begs room for a few Words in your next.\r\n\r\nFormerly this great contest was carried on upon paper. The conspirators\r\nagainst the rights and liberties of our country left no art untried, to\r\ninduce the people to submit to their unrighteous claims. But they were\r\ncircumvented by our watchful patriots. They were, if I may use the\r\nexpression, out-reasoned by some, and laughed off the stage by others;\r\nand we will never forget those steadfast and persevering friends, who\r\nforever prov'd themselves incapable of being brib'd by the soft\r\nwhispers of flattery, or awed by foul-mouthed calumny and the threats\r\nof power. Afterwards the contest became more serious and important. The\r\npeople of this country were not driven to take up arms, they did it\r\nvoluntarily in defence of their liberty. They properly considered\r\nthemselves as called by GOD, and warranted by HIM, to encounter every\r\nhazard in the common cause of Man. We have had for several years past a\r\nwell-appointed Army.--An Army of which both Officers and Privates are\r\ndaily increasing in discipline--An Army inferior perhaps to none at this\r\ntime on the face of the earth and headed by a COMMANDER, who feels the\r\nRights of the Citizens in his own breast, and experience has taught us,\r\nhe knows full well how to defend them.--May Heaven inspire that Army yet\r\nmore and more with Military Virtues, and teach their hands to war and\r\ntheir fingers to fight! May every citizen in the army and in the\r\ncountry, have a proper sense of the DEITY upon his mind, and an\r\nimpression of that declaration recorded in the Bible, \"Him that\r\nhonoreth me I will honor, but he that despiseth me shall be lightly\r\nesteemed.\"--\"God helpeth those who help themselves,\" says an eminent\r\nwriter. Perhaps the sentiment is better expressed in holy writ, where,\r\nwhen we are bid to work out our own salvation, we are told that \"It is\r\nGOD who worketh in us.\" It seems to be the Divine Constitution, that\r\nsuccess shall generally crown virtuous exertions. We have seen this\r\nverified throughout this glorious Struggle. The Military skill and\r\nprowess of our Army have kept us from being overwhelmed by our powerful\r\nenemies; and the political exertions of the CONGRESS have, by the\r\nsmiles of Heaven, obtained for us an Alliance with the most illustrious\r\nNation in Europe; and the warmest wishes of other Powers. Our affairs\r\nappear to be approaching to a great crisis. As momentary visits did not\r\nentirely fulfill the purpose of our generous ALLY, we may daily expect\r\nfrom him a naval and land force, designed to co-operate with our own\r\ntroops; and by a longer stay on the coasts of this continent, to give\r\nthe United States the opportunity of employing all their resources to\r\nthe greatest advantage. CONGRESS has called upon the several States to\r\nmake ready for this great crisis, and the several States have seconded\r\nthe call of Congress. The PEOPLE, the PEOPLE must, under GOD, give\r\nenergy to this all important call, and enable the combined Forces at\r\nonce to put an end to the War. If the PEOPLE NOW exert themselves, one\r\nstruggle more, by the blessing of Heaven, will rid us of all our\r\nEnemies. The Expectations at VERSAILLES from this joint effort are even\r\nsanguine-- CONGRESS is impatient to answer their just expectation--The eyes\r\nof EUROPE are upon us anxiously waiting for the great event. Our\r\nGENERAL, with his officers and army, are filled with ardor and generous\r\nambition to signalize their valour in the SALVATION of our\r\ncountry--SUPERIOR BEINGS would look down with the utmost astonishment, if\r\nwe should let this GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY slip--It cannot be. Our young men,\r\nambitious of laurels, will, at such a time, fly to their arms with the\r\nspeed of the wind, and ALL will be engaged in furnishing them with\r\nnecessary supplies, so shall this very campaign be DECISIVE and\r\nGLORIOUS. This State began the noble contest; we will honor ourselves\r\nby our utmost exertions to put a glorious end to it: we will contend\r\nwith our sister States in nothing, but who shall have the greatest\r\nshare of honor in this last and crowning effort-- Be assured, my dear\r\ncountrymen, the liberty, the happiness of America, and its consequence\r\nin the eyes of the world, depend upon our PRESENT activity and spirit--We\r\nwill not be wanting to ourselves, and the LORD do that which seemeth to\r\nhim right.\r\n\r\nVINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES BOWDOIN.\r\n\r\n[MS., Massachusetts Archives; a draft is in the Samuel Adams Papers,\r\nLenox Library, and the text is in W.

Measures will be adopted without Delay\r\nby the State of Connecticutt for this Purpose; and as we have\r\naccidentally met at this place (one of us on his Journey to & the other\r\nfrom Congress) we think it our Duty, in behalf of the Executive\r\nAuthority of the State of Massachusetts Bay, who cannot be notified of\r\nthis Affair in Season, to urge you as you regard the Interest &\r\nWellfare of your Country, immediately to put your Brigade under\r\nmarching orders to repair to West Point, on the Application of Major\r\nGeneral Howe, with Provisions sufficient to subsist them. As the\r\nGarrison is in great Want of Supplies, we think it advisable on this\r\nurgent occasion, and indeed indispensibly necessary that you should\r\nforthwith take all the Provisions in your County, that will not be\r\nwanting for the Consumption of its Inhabitants, & give Receipts for the\r\nsame payable at an early Period & at the Current Prices, & that you\r\nshould impress as many Waggons (if they cannot otherwise be procured)\r\nas will be requisite for the Transportation of the Provisions to the\r\nHighlands.\r\n\r\nWe submit it to your Consideration, whether it will not be expedient to\r\nnotify the State of Vermont, & the Commanding Officer in the County of\r\nHampshire to hold their Militia in Readiness to march at the shortest\r\nNotice, & to collect a sufficient Quantity of Provisions for their\r\nSubsistence. Your own Experience, & knowledge of the Importance of that\r\nPost, render it needless for us to press you to procure the most\r\nexpeditious & vigorous Exertions for its Support; nor need we describe\r\nthe deplorable Situation in which his Excellency Genl Washington & the\r\nbrave Army under his Command would be involvd, should a successfull\r\nAttack be made on the Post mentiond.\r\n\r\nWe shall immediately transmit to the Government of the State of\r\nMassachusetts a Copy of this Intelligence & of our Application to you,\r\n& remain with Esteem\r\n\r\nSir your most obedt & very hbl Servts,\r\n\r\n1 Brigadier General in the continental army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ROBERT HOWE.1\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nHARTFORD June 20 1780\r\n\r\nSIR\r\n\r\nBeing accidentally present in this Town, when his Excy Genl Washingtons\r\nLetter of the 18th was receivd by Governor Trumbull, the Contents of\r\nwhich he was pleasd to communicate to us, we judgd it necessary to\r\nwrite a Letter to Brigr General Fellows of the County of Berkshire in\r\nthe State of Massachusetts Bay, a Copy of which is inclosd. We indeed\r\nhave no Authority, from the State we have the Honor to represent in\r\nCongress, to take this Measure, but we considerd the Circumstances of\r\nAffairs too pressing to admit of Delay. We shall dispatch an Express to\r\nthe Government of Massachusetts with the Intelligence receivd, and wish\r\nyou to acquaint the Commander in Chiefe of the Measure we have taken.\r\n\r\nWe are &c\r\n\r\n1 Major general in the continental army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN FELLOWS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nHARTFORD June 21 1780\r\n\r\nSIR\r\n\r\nWe wrote to you yesterday, & inclosd Copy of a Letter of the 18th\r\nInstant from his Excy General Washington to his Excy Govr Trumbull,\r\nmentioning the Arrival of a Fleet at the Hook & the Probability of its\r\ncontaining Sir H. Clinton with his Army, and of his immediately\r\nattacking our Post at the Highlands; since which we have certain\r\nIntelligence that the Fleet was on the 19th at -------- Point, within twenty Miles\r\nof our Fortifications, and we have no Doubt that by this Time the Army\r\nhave debarkd & commencd their Operations. We therefore think it\r\nnecessary that you should forthwith march your Men to the Reliefe of\r\nthe Garrison, & take with you a sufficient Quantity of Provisions to\r\nsubsist your Brigade on the March to the Highlands & fourteen Days\r\nafter they shall have arrivd, with as much more as can be obtaind for\r\nthe Use of the Garrison. It will answer but little Purpose to march\r\nyour Men without Supplys. We have great Reliance on that Zeal &\r\nPatriotism which has so often distinguishd the County of Berkshire in\r\nthis great Contest; but should it so happen that Waggons cannot\r\notherwise be procured, we hope you will not hesitate a Moment to take\r\nthem wherever they may be found, on Certificates payable at an early\r\nPeriod, agreable to our former Recommendation. The Militia of the\r\nWestern Counties, will upon this Plan be put into immediate Motion, &\r\nwe think it advisable for you to send Expresses to the State of Vermont\r\n& the County of Hampshire, urging the Necessity of their marching their\r\nMilitia with Provisions for the Reliefe of the Garrison in the Manner\r\nmentiond.\r\n\r\nWe remain &c,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ROBERT HOWE.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nHARTFORD 21 June 1780\r\n\r\nSIR\r\n\r\nWe wrote to you yesterday. Having this Morning receivd intelligence of\r\nthe Movement of the Enemy up the River, we have sent another Express to\r\nBrigr Genl Fellows, urging him immediately to march to your Reliefe\r\nwith his Brigade of Militia with Provisions to subsist them on their\r\nWay to & 14 Days after they shall arrive at West Point. We have also\r\nadvisd him to throw into the Garrison all the Provisions that can be\r\nprocured, & to send Expresses to Vermont & the County of Hampshire in\r\nthe State of Mass. Bay, urging the Necessity of their marching their\r\nMilitia with Provisions for the Reliefe of the Garrison in the Manner\r\nmentiond. But it may be nevertheless necessary, if you think it a\r\nproper Measure, to send an Express to General Fellows for expediting\r\nthis Business. The most vigorous Measures are making by this State & we\r\nhave no Doubt but they will be effectual.\r\n\r\nWe are &c,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MARQUIS DE LA FAYETTE.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON June 1780\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MARQUISE\r\n\r\nYesterday your very obliging Letter of the 30 of May was brought to me\r\nby Mons Guinard. The Succour coming from France will be so seasonable\r\nand important, that if America is not wanting to her self, she will\r\nhave it in her Power, by the Blessing of Heaven, to gratify the utmost\r\nof her Wishes. His most Christian Majestys Expectation from us must\r\nneeds be great, and Gratitude to so generous an Ally, as well as a due\r\nAttention to our own Safety, Interest & Honor, lay us under the\r\nstrongest Obligations to be in Readiness to cooperate with the greatest\r\nAdvantage. I have long been fully sensible of your most cordial &\r\nzealous Attachment to our great Cause; and to your personal\r\nRepresentations to his Majesty, in Addition to the Benevolence of his\r\nRoyal Heart, I will take the Liberty to attribute his Design to afford\r\nus such Aid and for so long a Time as may put it in our Power to employ\r\nall our Resources against the Enemy. It fortunately happend that the\r\nGeneral Assembly of this State was sitting when the Letter & Inclosures\r\nfrom the Committee of Congress came to the President of the Council.\r\nThey were immediately laid before the Assembly, & I have the Pleasure\r\nto assure you that the filling our Battalions by an immediate Draft\r\nfurnishing the Army with Provisions and every other Measure for the\r\nfulfilling the just Expectations of your Sovereign & of Congress on\r\nthis most important Occasion are the Objects of their closest\r\nAttention. I had for several Months past been flattering my self with\r\nthe Prospect of this Aid. It strongly impressd my Mind from some\r\nCircumstances which took place when you was at Philadelphia the last\r\nyear. But far from Certainty I could only express to some confidential\r\nFriends here, a distant Hope, tho, as I conceivd, not without some good\r\nEffect. At least it servd to enliven our Spirits and animate us for so\r\ngreat a Crisis. If it were possible for one to be forgetful of our all\r\nimportant Cause for a Moment, my particular Friendship for you would be\r\na prevailing Inducement with me, to make my utmost feeble Exertions to\r\nprevent your Disappointment after the great Pains you have taken to\r\nserve us. I have Endeavord, & shall continue those Endeavors while I\r\nstay here, to brighten the dark Side of the Picture which your\r\nImagination has painted in one part of your Letter before me. God\r\nforbid that we should be obligd to tell our friends when they arrive,\r\nthat we have not a sufficient Army to cooperate with them nor\r\nprovisions to feed the few Soldiers that are left. I think I may\r\nventure to predict that this State will comply with the Requisitions\r\nfrom her, to give the utmost Respectability to our Army on so promising\r\nan Occasion. I was in the Council Chamber when I receivd your Letter &\r\ntook the Liberty of reading some parts of it to the Members present. I\r\nwill communicate other parts of it to some leading Members of the House\r\nof Representatives as Prudence may dictate, particularly what you\r\nmention of the officers Want of Cloathing.\r\n\r\nI thank you my dear Sir for the friendly remembrance you had of the\r\nHint I gave you when you was here. Be pleasd to pay my most respectful\r\nCompliments to the Commander in Chiefe, his Family &c. and be assured\r\nof the warm affection of your obliged friend & very hbl Servt\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Adams Papers, Quincy.]\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA JULY 10 1780.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nI wrote to you several Times when I was at Boston, and receivd your\r\nFavor by the Marquis de la Fayette. Another, to which you referrd me,\r\nhas not yet come to hand. This Letter will be deliverd to you by Mr\r\nSearle, a Member of Congress for the State of Pennsylvania. He will be\r\nbetter able to inform you of the State of things here, than I can, who\r\nafter twelve Months Absence from this City, returnd but a few days ago.\r\nThe People of Massachusetts have at length agreed to the Form of a\r\ncivil Constitution, in Nothing varying from a Copy which I sent to you\r\nby a Son of our Friend General Warren. This great Business was carried\r\nthrough with much good Humour among the People, and even in Berkshire,\r\nwhere some Persons led us to expect it would meet with many\r\nObstructions. Never was a good Constitution more wanted than at this\r\nJuncture. Among other more lasting Advantages, I hope that in\r\nConsequence of it, the Part which that State must take in the War, will\r\nbe conducted with greater Attention and better Effect. Who is to be the\r\nfirst Man, will be determind in September, when if our News papers\r\nrightly inform us, the new Government is to take Place. The Burden will\r\nfall on the Shoulders of one of two Gentlemen whom you know. May Heaven\r\nlead the People to the wisest Choice. The first chosen Governor may\r\nprobably have it in his Power to do more good or more Hurt than any of\r\nhis successors. The french Fleet is not yet arrivd. Perhaps their long\r\nPassage may turn out for the best. An earlier Arrival might have found\r\nus not altogether prepared to cooperate with them to the best\r\nAdvantage. I now think we shall be ready to joyn them. One would think\r\nthe Exertion which America might make with such Aid, would rid us of\r\nBritish Barbarians.

You cannot imagine with how much Pleasure I receivd it. I have no\r\nReason to doubt your Sincerity when you express the warmest Affection\r\nfor your Mother and me, because I have had the most convincing Proof of\r\nit in the whole Course of your Life. Be equally attentive to every\r\nRelation into which all-wise Providence may lead you, and I will\r\nventure to predict for my dear Daughter, an unfailing Source of\r\nHappiness in the Reflections of her own Mind. If you carefully fulfill\r\nthe various Duties of Life, from a Principle of Obedience to your\r\nheavenly Father, you shall enjoy that Peace which the World cannot give\r\nnor take away. In steadily pursuing the Path of Wisdom & Virtue I am\r\nsometimes inclind to think you have been influenced with a View of\r\npleasing me. This is indeed endearing, and I owe you the Debt of\r\nGratitude. But the pleasing an Earthly Parent, I am perswaded, has not\r\nbeen your principal Motive to be religious. If this has any Influence\r\non your Mind, you know you cannot gratify me so much, as by seeking\r\nmost earnestly, the Favor of Him who made & supports you--who will supply\r\nyou with whatever his infinite Wisdom sees best for you in this World,\r\nand above all, who has given us his Son to purchase for us the Reward\r\nof Eternal Life--Adieu, and believe that I have...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES BOWDOIN.\r\n\r\n[Proceedings of Massachusetts Historical Society, 1st ser., vol. xii.,\r\npp. 229, 230.]\r\n\r\nPHIL. Aug. 22, 1780.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,--I have received your favor of the 31st of July & forwarded\r\nthe letter inclosed to Mrs. Reed who resides in the country.\r\n\r\nThe Count de Rochambeau, in a letter to Congress, speaks very highly of\r\nthe attention of the Government of Massachusetts, & of the appearance\r\nof the numerous Militia so seasonably forwarded when an attack was\r\nexpected in Rhode Island. And the Minister of France, who on every\r\noccasion expresses his great regards for that state, mentioned the same\r\nthing to its Delegates in the most flattering terms. It is a pity that\r\na Militia, always ready to turn out with a view of doing essential\r\nservice, should be disappointed. They were so full of ardor that the\r\nCount was under a necessity of urging their return to their necessary\r\naffairs at home, with the promise of their being again called for, when\r\nGen! Washington should judge that the circumstances of affairs should\r\nrequire it. We are impatient for the arrival of the 2d division of the\r\nFrench Squadron, which we are informed by letters from Boston was spoke\r\nwith near a month ago by a vessel bound to Salem. The season is\r\nadvancing fast, & our troops must daily consume provision the bare\r\ntransportation of which is an immense cost. I perceive that the General\r\nAssembly stands further prorogued to the 31st of this month. I am sorry\r\nthat a state of our claim of territory in the New Hampshire Grant has\r\nnot yet been forwarded to Congress; for although it is my wish as an\r\nindividual that this uncomfortable dispute may subside till a more\r\nconvenient season, yet I would not willingly be under the necessity of\r\nsaying, when called upon after so long notice, that our state is not\r\nready. It might have the appearance of a consciousness in ourselves,\r\nthat our claim is not well founded.\r\n\r\nOur new Constitution is much approved of by many gentlemen here. I\r\nunderstand it is soon to be in force. I do most earnestly pray that\r\nHeaven may direct the people to the choice of a wise man for their\r\nGovernor, & incline him to accept of the trust.\r\n\r\nThe post is just going, which obliges me to conclude.\r\n\r\nI am with very great respect,\r\n\r\nYour assured friend & Very hble Servt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN LOWELL.\r\n\r\n[Historical Magazine, 1st ser., vol. i., p. 260; a portion of the text\r\nis in W. V. Wells, Life of Samuel Adams, vol. iii., pp. 106, 107; a\r\ndraft, dated September 17, 1780, is in the Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox\r\nLibrary.]\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA, Sept. 15, 1780.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday last, Congress took up the disputes relating to the New\r\nHampshire grants, agreeably to an order, which passed the 9th of June,\r\nand for want of nine states, exclusive of the three interested ones,\r\nthe matter was put off till yesterday. The delegates of New Hampshire\r\nand New York, were prepared with instructions from their respective\r\nstates. A letter from Mr. Chittenden and others styling themselves \"The\r\nExecutive Council of Vermont,\" was sent in by their agents now in this\r\ncity, claiming the rights of sovereignty of an independent state, and\r\nrefusing to submit the question of their independence to Congress, as\r\nbeing incompetent to judge and determine thereon. As there was no\r\nquestion proposed, a conversation, rather than a debate, ensued, which\r\nended with a call for adjournment at the usual hour. This day, a letter\r\nwas sent in to the president from agents in Vermont, praying that in\r\ncase any question should be agitated concerning the rights and\r\nindependence of their state, they might be admitted to be present and\r\nhear the debates. Another conversation was begun, which was very soon\r\ninterrupted by a call of the attention of the house to the present\r\nstate and circumstances of the army. I am of opinion that Congress will\r\nnot easily agree in the question proper to be first put, however\r\nobvious it may seem to be. This is among a thousand other affairs with\r\nwhich it is the fate of Congress to be plagued to the exclusion of\r\nconsiderations of infinitely greater consequence, and which require\r\nimmediate attention. As an individual, I wish most heartily that it\r\ncould subside, as things of much greater moment generally do, till \"a\r\nmore convenient season.\" But New York presses hard for a decision, and\r\nI submit to your judgment whether it would not be prudent that the\r\nclaims of Massachusetts to the lands in question should be here in\r\nreadiness, lest a construction should be put on a further delay that a\r\nconsciousness in the Assembly, of the state having no right in them is\r\nthe real occasion of it. I mention this to you in particular, because I\r\nrecollect how far you had gone in investigating the title. If you can\r\nbe spared from the Assembly, I hope you will be appointed to vindicate\r\nthe claim.\r\n\r\nI just now told you that the attention of Congress was called to the\r\narmy. General Washington has written several letters acquainting\r\nCongress of the distressed circumstances of the army for want of\r\nprovisions and particularly meat. They have several times lately, been\r\nwithout provisions for three or four days. They have even plundered the\r\nneighboring villages, and what will be the consequence of such a spirit\r\nin our army if it should prevail, may be easily conceived. You are\r\nsensible that the dependence is chiefly on the Eastern States for that\r\nkind of supply. Massachusetts has indeed been more punctural than the\r\nrest. The Commissary General has told me that the very existence of the\r\narmy has been in a great measure owing to the industry and care of our\r\nCommittee at Springfield. Yet even our supplies have not been equal to\r\nexpectation. 597 head of cattle have been sent from Massachusetts to\r\nthe army from the first of July to the seventh of September. About 200\r\nto the posts at the Northward and about 200 to the French army, which\r\nlast are not included in the supply required as our quota. Congress\r\nhave pressingly called upon New Hampshire, Massachusetts and\r\nConnecticut for 1000 head weekly, less than which will not be more than\r\nsufficient for the immediate demands of the army. Our quota is 285 as\r\nyou will see by a resolution forwarded by this express. Besides which,\r\nmagazines must be laid up this winter for the army the next year.\r\nIndeed, my friend, we must make the utmost exertion in the great cause.\r\nIt is now 12 o'clock, and the express will set off very early in the\r\nmorning. I suppose our countrymen have by this time made choice of\r\ntheir Senators and Magistrates. I hope heaven has directed them to a\r\nchoice that will do them honor. I cannot help feeling anxious to know\r\nwhether they have united in a man for the governor, endowed with those\r\nvirtues which should be characteristic of the first magistrate. Be\r\npleased to let my much esteemed friend, Dr. Cooper, know that if he has\r\nwritten, I have not received a line from him since I left Boston. We\r\nsuffer for want of such favors. In hope of receiving one from you,\r\n\r\nI remain very affectionately yours,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA Sept 19 1780\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BETSY\r\n\r\nIn a Letter to Mr Appleton of the 17th, I desired him to inform you\r\nthat I was well. I thank God I continue so, tho I am very sollicitous\r\nto know how it fares with you and my dear Connections in Boston. Our\r\nFriends at that Distance may be in their Graves before one may even\r\nhear of their previous Sickness. You cannot wonder then that I am in\r\nAnxiety every Moment. Upon this Consideration alone, the pub-lick\r\nService so far from one's Family, must be conceivd to be a Sacrifice of\r\nno small Value. The Man who has devoted himself to the Service of God\r\nand his Country will chearfully make every Sacrifice. I will not fail\r\ndaily to commend you to the Care and Protection of Heaven, in Hopes of\r\nseeing you the next Spring.\r\n\r\nBy a Letter of good Authority from Hillsborough in North Carolina dated\r\nthe 9th of Septr, we are informd that Col1 Marian of South Carolina who\r\ncommanded a Body of Militia had surprisd a Party of the Enemy near\r\nSantee River escorting 150 Prisoners of the Maryland Division. He took\r\nthe Party & relievd the Prisoners, & was on the March to Cross Creek,\r\nwhere General Gates had sent Lt Col1 Ford with proper Officers to\r\nconduct them to Hillsbro'. When they joyn, our LOSS in Continentals\r\nwill be small in Comparison of what was expected. Pray send the Inclosd\r\nto Captain James Shepherd. Remember me to my Family & Friends.

Octob [6] 1780\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nI have not yet acknowledgd your Favor of the 17th of Septr.\r\n\r\nIt is no Novelty to me to hear you expressing your well directed Zeal\r\nfor the Safety & Welfare of our Country; and I cannot but applaud your\r\nJealousy of Injury to the Publick from a Misapplication of the\r\nResolutions of Congress respecting the Admission of British Effects. A\r\nResolution is now on the Table to guard it from the Dangers which you\r\napprehend.\r\n\r\nI have now before me your Letter of the 17th of Septr, & I am obligd to\r\nyou for the favorable Allowance you make for my having omitted to write\r\nto you lately. Without Partiality I may say, you have done me but\r\nJustice. And yet I would have written a Letter by the last post, if I\r\ncould have given you any tollerable Assurance respecting your Affair\r\nwith Mr B. I will continue to press the Matter till it is finishd.\r\n\r\nWhy will you upbraid me, my Friend, with the Votes of \"my beloved\r\nTown,\" in favor of a Man, whom neither you nor I would set up for a\r\nGovernor? It is true, I love the People of Boston most fervently. I\r\nhave spent much of my Time in their Service, & have labord to promote\r\ntheir Reputation and true Interest. I confess that I feel chagrind and\r\nam disappointed at the Preference they have given. But is an honest &\r\nvirtuous People incapable of Error? They acted, you will say, with\r\ntheir Eyes open. They knew the different Characters, Abilities & Merit\r\nof the Candidates. But, they were deceivd with false Appearances for\r\nthe Moment. A due Attention to the Administration of Government will\r\nenable them to measure the Capacity of him whom they have made the\r\nobject of their present Choice. That Watchfulness, & Jealousy, which I\r\nstill hold to be the best Security of the publick Liberty, will guard\r\nthem against future Mistakes.\r\n\r\nI have not Time at present to write you so long a Letter as I intended.\r\nBut before I conclude I must inform you, that it is hinted to us by a\r\nFriend, that Colo Sears, who has lately been at Camp, has reported in\r\nBoston that Mr M declared there repeatedly, that Congress consisted of\r\na Set of Ro------s, & that he should turn his Back upon them. I wish, if Mr S\r\nheard that Declaration, he wd certify it, that proper Notice may be\r\ntaken of it. No Member of any Body of Men will answer for the Character\r\nof every Individual; but if Mr M expressd himself in that Manner, it\r\nwas false and injurious. I have heard of such Language before, coming\r\nfrom Persons of contemptible Characters, influencd by Men who rightly\r\njudge, that to destroy the Confidence of the People in Congress, is to\r\nwound our Cause in the most tender Part. It is the Language of Tories,\r\nwhich in times passd would not have been sufferd to pass unpunishd.\r\n\r\nAdieu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILAD Oct 10 1780\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BETSY\r\n\r\nI had the Pleasure last Week of receiving your very affectionate Letter\r\nof the 14th of Septr by the Post. You did not expressly tell me that\r\nyou was well. A material Circumstance, which you must never omit to\r\nmention. It is a great Satisfaction to me to be informd, that Mr Arthur\r\nLee was respectfully treated by my Friends in Boston. My Friends are\r\nhis, & I believe, on the same Principle. But Mr ---- has not seen him. Is not\r\nMr ---- my Friend? He professes to be such; and I do verily believe he is as\r\nmuch so as he can be. Could I always adjust my Ideas of Politicks to\r\nhis Views, I might perhaps insure the most flattering Expressions of\r\nhis Friendship.\r\n\r\nI expect soon to see it announcd in the Papers, that Mr Hancock is\r\nelected Governor of the Common Wealth of Massachusetts. I confess I did\r\nnot foresee that Boston would have been so united as I find they were,\r\nwhen two such Competitors as he & Mr Bowdoin were set up. Their\r\nrespective Characters, Abilities & Merit were well known to the\r\nElectors, who have therefore acted with their Eyes open. It is to be\r\npresumd, that they have been influencd to this Choice by the pure\r\nMotives of publick Affection. A due Attention to the Administration of\r\nGovernment, I fancy, will soon determine whether they have acted with\r\nWisdom or not.\r\n\r\nBy the inclosd Paper you will observe, that the late Genl Arnold, after\r\nhaving committed the blackest Treason against his Country has thrown\r\nhimself into the Arms of its Enemies. You know, that I have long had my\r\nSuspicions of this Traitor, & therefore you will not wonder that I am\r\nnot so much astonishd as if any other officer had been detected. He has\r\nbeen gibbeted in the Streets by the Populace, anathematizd by the\r\nClergy in the Pulpit, & his Name has with Indignation been struck out\r\nof the List of Officers by Order of Congress.1 Remember me to my Family\r\n& Friends.\r\n\r\nAdieu.\r\n\r\n1 A draft dated October 3, 1780, has at this point the words: \"This\r\nCity has for some time past been a complete Hospital, and many are\r\nstill sick.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHIL. Oct 17-1780\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BETSY\r\n\r\nYesterday I had the pleasure of receiving your Letter of the 2 7 of\r\nSeptr by the hand of my valueable Friend Mr Arthur Lee. As it was three\r\nweeks old I had a Right to expect another by the Post, but am\r\ndisappointed. I have ever esteemd Mr Lee one of the most virtuous,\r\nactive & able American Patriots. This opinion, you know, I have long\r\nentertaind of him, and therefore you justly conclude, that he meets\r\nwith the most cordial Reception from me.\r\n\r\nYou was mistaken when you supposd that I had heard who were chosen into\r\nthe highest Places under our new Constitution. We are not so well\r\ninformd. I had Reason to believe that Mr Hancock would be the Governor.\r\nI am disposd to think, that my Fellow Citizens had upright Views in\r\ngiving him their Suffrages. Many Circumstances have combind to make his\r\nElection appear to be politically necessary; and if the People, who are\r\nnow blessd with so great a Privilege, will exercise that Watchfulness\r\nover Men whom they exalt to Places of Power, which their Duty &\r\nInterest should lead them to do, I flatter myself that his will prove a\r\nhappy Choice. You may wonder at my saying so; but I think I am not\r\nmisguided in my Judgment in this Instance. If they have now chosen a\r\nwise & virtuous Governor, a few only will be disappointed; if\r\notherwise, Many will see their Error, and will be indued to greater\r\nVigilance for the future. I am far from being an Enemy to that\r\nGentleman, tho' he has been prevaild upon to mark me as such. I have so\r\nmuch Friendship for him, as to wish with all my Heart, that in the most\r\ncritical Circumstances, he may distinguish between his real Friends &\r\nhis flattering Enemies. Or rather between the real Friends of the\r\nCountry & those who will be ready to offer the Incense of Flattery to\r\nhim who is the first Man in it. This will require an accurate Knowledge\r\nof Men. I therefore again wish that he may have the most able &\r\nfaithful Councellors to assist him in the Administration of Affairs.\r\nCan I say more? If, with the best Advice he is able to hold the Reins\r\nof Government with Dignity, I wish him a Continuance of the Honor. If\r\nhe renders our Country secure in a flourishing Condition, I will never\r\nbe so partial & unjust as to withhold my Tribute of Applause.\r\n\r\nAdieu my dear\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES WARREN.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA Oct 24 1780\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nI have not yet laid aside your Letter of the 17th of Septr which is the\r\nlast I have been favord with from you. It ill becomes you, my Friend,\r\nto think of retiring into private Life, who can lay your hand on your\r\nheart, and say that in your publick Conduct your have in no Instance\r\ndeviated from virtuous Principles. If ever the Time should come, when\r\nvain & aspiring Men shall possess the highest Seats in Government, our\r\nCountry will stand in Need of its experiencd Patriots to prevent its\r\nRuin. There may be more Danger of this, than some, even of our well\r\ndisposd Citizens may imagine. If the People should grant their\r\nSuffrages to Men, only because they conceive them to have been Friends\r\nto the Country, without Regard to the necessary Qualifications for the\r\nPlaces they are to fill, the Administration of Government will become a\r\nmere Farce, and our pub-lick Affairs will never be put on the Footing\r\nof solid Security. We should inquire into the Tempers of Men, in order\r\nto form a Judgment in what Manner the publick Trusts to be reposed in\r\nthem will be executed. You remember the Character of Pisistratus. He\r\nwas a Citizen of Athens, supposd to have many excellent Qualities, but\r\nhe had an insatiable Lust of Pre-eminence. Solon could discover his\r\nVanity, but the People were blinded by a false Glare of Virtues and he\r\nwas their Idol. Under Pretence of his having escaped imminent Danger\r\nfrom a violent Faction, and the further Insecurity of his Person he\r\nartfully obtaind a Guard of Soldiers, by which Means he possessd\r\nhimself of the Citadel & usurpd the Government. But though he made\r\nhimself Sovereign, & thus far overthrew the popular Election, the\r\nHistorian tells us, \"that he made no Change in the Magistracy or the\r\nLaws.--He was content that others should hold their Places according to\r\nthe establishd Rules of the Constitution, so that he might continue\r\nArchon, independent of the Suffrages of the People. This he effected;\r\nfor though several Attempts were made, to deprive him of the\r\nSovereignty which he had so violently obtaind, he held it till his\r\nDeath & left it to his Children.\" Such was the Ambition of this Man,\r\nwho indeed assumd the Government, and such were the Effects of it.\r\nPower is intoxicating; and Men legally vested with it, too often\r\ndiscover a Disposition to make an ill Use of it & an Unwillingness to\r\npart with it. HOW different was Pisistratus from that Roman Hero and\r\nPatriot Lucius Quinctius Cincinatus who, tho vested with the Authority\r\nof Dictator, was so moderate in his Desires of a Continuance of Power,\r\nthat, having in six Weeks fulfilld the Purposes of his Appointment, he\r\nresignd the dangerous office, which he might have held till the\r\nExpiration of six Months.--When we formerly had weak and wicked Governors\r\n& Magistrates, it was our Misfortune; but for the future, while we\r\nenjoy and exercise the inestimable Right of chusing them ourselves, it\r\nwill be our Disgrace. I hope our Countrymen will always keep a watchful\r\nEye over the publick Conduct of those whom they exalt to Power, making\r\nat the same time every just Allowance for the Imperfections of human\r\nNature; and I pray God we may never see Men filling the sacred Seats of\r\nGovernment, who are either wanting in adequate Abilities, or influencd\r\nby any Views Motives or Feelings seperate from the publick Welfare.\r\n\r\nAdieu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO RICHARD HENRY LEE.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADE Octob 31 1780\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nI cannot begin this Letter but by intreating you to impute my past\r\nOmission to any Cause you please excepting a Forgetfulness or willful\r\nNeglect. The making of Apologys is among Friends so formal a Business\r\nthat I hardly know how to set myself about it. I am sure you will not\r\nbe prevaild upon to suspect the Cordiality of my Affection for you.\r\nThat I assure you would be punishing me more than I am conscious I\r\ndeserve. I will frankly own to you that I am astonishd at the\r\nReflection of four Months having elapsd since I last came to this City,\r\nwithout my having written to you one Letter, even to acknowledge the\r\nfavor I have receivd from you. But will you my friend bury what may\r\nseem to you a Fault in oblivion upon my Promise to amend for the future.\r\n\r\nI have more to say to you than my Leisure will at present allow. And\r\nindeed the Situation of your Country, I fear is likely to be such as to\r\nrender the Conveyance of Letters precarious and a free Communication of\r\nSentiments unsafe. Should they fall into the Enemies hands we know not\r\nwhat Use they will make of them--to be sure an ill use & very probably\r\ninjurious to our great Cause.\r\n\r\nI hope the People of Virginia are able to prevent the Troops that may\r\nhave arrivd from taking a Post there. It will give our Enemies occasion\r\nto boast of their having subdued that populous State, in order to give\r\nan unfavorable Aspect to our Affairs, in Europe. This, with other\r\nimportant Considerations, should induce you to make every possible\r\nExertion to defeat their Design. I have always thought that the\r\nIntelligence contained in a Letter of Colo Campbell intercepted last\r\nSpring was genuine. If so, the making a Lodgment at Portsmouth is a\r\nmaterial Part of their Plan.\r\n\r\nUpon conversing with your Brother Mr Arthur Lee, I am confirmd in my\r\nown opinion that his Character is very different from that which his\r\nEnemies gave him two years ago. You know I have long corresponded with\r\nhim, and a Mans confidential Letters are so sure a Criterion by which\r\nto judge of his real Disposition, that I before thought I could not be\r\nmistaken. He has shared the Fate of honest Patriots in all Times of\r\nCorruption in being persecuted. But I am satisfied the People in the\r\nEastern States entertain an high opinion of his Integrity & Abilities.\r\nI hope he will meet with Justice in Congress. I think he merits\r\nApplause.\r\n\r\nPlease to pay my Respects to Mrs Lee--your Brother Colo Frank & others to\r\nwhom they are due. I will write as often as I can. Adieu & be assured\r\nthat I am affectionately\r\n\r\nYour Friend\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SAMUEL COOPER.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADA Novr 7 1780\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nYour favor of the 21st of Septr was deliverd to me by my very worthy\r\nFriend Mr Arthur Lee who came to this City about a Fortnight ago. The\r\nRespect which you say was paid to him by the principal Gentlemen in\r\nBoston is exceedingly pleasing to me, because, from an intimate &\r\nconfidential Correspondence with him for ten years, I am convincd that\r\nhe was among the most early and consistent American Patriots. His\r\ninflexible Virtue in the first Stages of our Contest renderd him\r\nobnoxious to the great & powerful in England, and equally of late to\r\ninterrested Persons in France & their Connexions in America. My\r\nFriendship for him is not private; it is grounded altogether on publick\r\nPrinciples. You tell me, his short Residence in the State of\r\nMassachusetts, has been very far from diminishing that Estimation in\r\nwhich the People held him there. I should have been indeed sorry if it\r\nhad been otherwise; for his great Services to them in particular, had\r\njustly merited their Esteem. I rejoyce that my own Countrymen are not\r\nungrateful. I hope they will always be too knowing and too just, either\r\nto pay servile Hommage to the weak and wicked, or to withhold the Marks\r\nof their Approbation due to the wise and good.\r\n\r\nYou have doubtless before this time been informd that Congress have\r\ncalled on the States to take immediate and effectual Measures to fill\r\nup the Army with their respective Quotas during the War. They have\r\nsince orderd a Tax to the Value of Six Millions of Dollars in Specie;\r\nto be paid partly in specifick Articles for the Supply of the Army, and\r\nthe Remainder in Gold & Silver or Bills of the new Emission. Their\r\nDesign is to have a permanent Army, and to provide adequate Magazines\r\nfor its subsistence without Delay. We have often a Choice of\r\nDifficulties presented to us. I think, upon the whole, we have in this\r\nInstance fixed upon the best Method. At least it appears to me to be\r\nthe surest, considering all our Circumstances. And I am the more\r\nsatisfied, because I understand that our Legislature have anticipated\r\nthe Measure and already begun to assess the Towns for their respective\r\nProportions of the specifick Articles. Had our Money been stable we\r\nmight have contracted for the Supply of our Army; but the Paper, as all\r\nthe World knows, is depreciated, for which we are in part obligd to our\r\nEnemies, who are dexterous in counterfeiting.\r\n\r\nOur Affairs in N Carolina wear a more agreable Aspect than they did a\r\nfew Weeks ago. The Enemy, you have heard, are got into Chessapeak Bay.\r\nIt is said they are landed at Portsmouth & Hampton & that they burn all\r\nbefore them. It is also said that the Militia turned out with great\r\nSpirit, but we have had no official Letters by the last post. Although\r\nwe are pressd with Difficulties, we are in chearful Spirits and by the\r\nBlessing of Heaven Expect to overcome them. Adieu my dear Sir, and\r\nbelieve me to be affectionately,\r\n\r\nYour Friend,\r\n\r\nBe pleasd to acquaint Mrs A that I am in good Health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library]\r\n\r\nPHILADE Novr 11th 1780\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BETSY\r\n\r\nI have receivd no Letter from you since the 9th of October. Some\r\nAccident prevented the Arrival of the Eastern Post last Monday and he\r\nis now not expected till the next. I hope I shall then receive a Line\r\nfrom you, to let me know at least that you are well. If you do not\r\nacknowledge the Receipt of my Letter of the 10th of October, I shall\r\nconclude that it fell into wrong hands: for the Post that took Charge\r\nof the Letters from hence of that Date, was robbd of his Mail in\r\nConnecticut and it was carried to New York. I am uncertain whether I\r\nsent that Letter to the Post Office, or deliverd it to Mr Torry who\r\nleft this City about the same time. If the Enemy have filchd it, their\r\npublishing it would do no good to them nor Injury to me or any one\r\nelse. Indeed it was an harmless thing, and worth no ones Notice but\r\nyours, and yours, only as it was intended to inform you that I was\r\nthen, as I am at this Time, in good health. I flatter myself you are\r\nalways gratified when I can give you this Intelligence.\r\n\r\nNovr 13th\r\n\r\nThe Post is just arrivd & has not brought me a Letter from you--his latest\r\nLetters and Papers are dated the 26th of Octobr. By the next we expect\r\nto receive Accounts of the Organization of our Government under the new\r\nConstitution, in all its Splendor-- to see the Speech from the Chair--the\r\nAnswers from the several Branches of the Legislature--congratulatory\r\nAddresses &c, &c. I have been anxious, lest our Countrymen should\r\nmisjudge in the Choice of their first Governor. They are grateful; and\r\nI was affraid that from the Goodness of their Hearts they might be\r\nindued to give their Suffrages for a Man, who, they might conceive had\r\ndone them eminent Services in other Stations, without a due\r\nConsideration whether he possesses those excellent Qualities which\r\nshould characterize and dignify their chiefe Magistrate. Our present\r\nGovernors may probably stamp the moral as well as political Character\r\nof the People. I shall most heartily rejoyce, if the \"Abilities and\r\ndisinterested Zeal\" of the Gentleman called to fill the Chair prove\r\nadequate to the strong Expectations of my fellow Citizens in Boston,\r\nexpressd in their late Vote of Thanks. But why do I trouble you with a\r\nSubject of this Nature? Let me ask you before I finish this Letter--Are\r\nyou in Health? Have you a Sufficiency of Fire wood & other Necessaries\r\nfor the approaching cold Season? Are your Family Cares alleviated with\r\nthe Visits & chearful Conversation of your Friends and mine? You must\r\nanswer me these Questions, for I am greatly interrested in them. My\r\nLove to my Family and Friends. Adieu my Dear. Believe me to be most\r\nsincerely and affectionately\r\n\r\nYour,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES WARREN.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADE NOVR 20 1780\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nIn your Letter of the 17th of Septr which is still before me, you say\r\n\"the Tongue of Malice has always been employd against me\"; and in\r\nmentioning it you discover the Feelings of a Friend. It may perhaps in\r\nsome Measure relieve those Feelings if I tell you, that it serves to\r\nmake me more watchful over my self, lest by any Misconduct I might\r\nafford Occasion to the malicious Man to say things of me which would\r\ngive me just Cause to be ashamd. It is said to be a Misfortune to a\r\nMan, when all speak well of him. Is it then an Advantage to a Man to\r\nhave Enemies? It may be so if he has wisdom to make a good Use of them.\r\nWe are apt to be partial in our own Judgment of our selves. Our Friends\r\nare either blind to our Faults or not faithful enough to tell us of\r\nthem. The Malicious Man will speak all Manner of Evil against us, and\r\ncontrive Means to send it Post haste to our Ears; and if among much\r\nSlander they say some Truths, what have we to do, but correct past\r\nErrors & guard against future ones. The Report which you mention as\r\npropagated of me is groundless. Would any Man in his Senses who wishes\r\nthe War may be carried on with Vigor, prefer the temporary and\r\nexpensive Drafts of Militia, to a permanent and well appointed Army!\r\nBut Envy has no other Business than to calumniate.--\r\n\r\nMr Penny has deliverd me your favor of the 2d Instant. He has also\r\nbrought us a Paper which exhibits a Picture of the Times. You express\r\ntoo much Resentment at the Ingratitude which you imagine has been shown\r\nto your Friend--that his Name is not to be found in any of the Lists--and\r\nespecially, that he could not be supported in Competition with Mr\r\nAvery--Your Friend has no Claims on his Country, nor does he set himself\r\nin Competition with Mr A, who in some Respects is thought to be a\r\nnecessary Man. He is one, whom, I confess, I regard for his Honesty and\r\neasy good Humour. We have been entertaind with the Speeches both before\r\nand after the putting on the Regalia; and we expect to see\r\ncongratulatory Addresses from various Orders civil & ecclesiastical. I\r\nshould pity the Governor if I thought him apt to be discomposd with the\r\nhigh Complimentary Stile. It is usual in all Honey Moons. I could wish\r\nto see, if we must have abundant Addresses, the manly Simplicity of\r\nBarcklay the Quaker in his Dedication to Charles the 2d of England.\r\nExcepting that Instance, I do not recollect to have seen an Address to\r\na great Man, that was not more or less, & very often deeply, tincturd\r\nwith Flattery.--If the Town Clerk of Ephesus has treated me \"with very\r\ngreat Disrespect,\" I am sorry for him. It gives me no Uneasiness on my\r\nown Account. If he \"treats every one in that way who will not worship\r\nthe Great Image,\" he leaves me in the best of Company--Company, which he\r\nmay at another Time, find it his own Interest, if that governs him, to\r\ncourt & respect. We are even reduced to the Hutchinsonian Times, if a\r\nCitizen shall think himself constraind to malign his old Friend, merely\r\nbecause the Great Man has been prevaild upon to mark him as his\r\nEnemy.--But the History of all Ages & all Countrys shows, that there is no\r\nAbsurdity into which Idolatry will not lead Men. Remember me to My\r\nFriend Mr Gerry, & let him know that I have not forgot his Letters, &\r\nthat I will write to him soon. Adieu my dear Sir.\r\n\r\nYour affectionate,\r\n\r\nWill you call on Mrs A & let her know that I am well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS WELLS.1\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA Novr 22 1780\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR WELLS\r\n\r\nAlthough I have not yet acknowledgd the obliging Letter you wrote to me\r\nsome time ago, I would not have you entertain a Doubt of my sincere\r\nRespect and the Confidence I place in you. I think I gave you the\r\nstrongest Proof of this when I was last in Boston. From that Moment I\r\nhave considerd myself particularly interested in your Wellfare. It\r\ncannot indeed be otherwise, since I then consented that you should form\r\nthe most intimate Connection with the dear Girl whom I pride myself in\r\ncalling my Daughter. I did this with Caution and Deliberation; and\r\nhaving done it, I am now led to contemplate the Relation in which I am\r\nmyself to stand with you, and I can [hardly] forbear the same Stile in\r\nthis Letter, which I should take the Liberty to use if I was writing to\r\nher. The Marriage State was designd to complete the Sum of human\r\nHappiness in this Life. It some times proves otherwise; but this is\r\nowing to the Parties themselves, who either rush into it without due\r\nConsideration, or fail in point of Discretion in their Conduct towards\r\neach other afterwards. It requires Judgment on both Sides, to conduct\r\nwith exact Propriety; for though it is acknowledgd, that the\r\nSuperiority is & ought to be in the Man, yet as the Mannagement of a\r\nFamily in many Instances necessarily devolves on the Woman, it is\r\ndifficult always to determine the Line between the Authority of the one\r\n& the Subordination of the other. Perhaps the Advice of the good Bishop\r\nof St Asaph on another Occasion, might be adopted on this, and that is,\r\nnot to govern too much. When the married Couple strictly observe the\r\ngreat Rules of Honor & Justice towards each other, Differences, if any\r\nhappen, between them, must proceed from small & trifling Circumstances.\r\nOf what Consequence is it, whether a Turkey is brought on the Table\r\nboild or roasted? And yet, how often are the Passions sufferd to\r\ninterfere in such mighty Disputes, till the Tempers of both become so\r\nsowerd, that they can scarcely look upon each other with any tolerable\r\nDegree of good Humor. I am not led to this particular Mode of treating\r\nthe Subject from an Apprehension of more than common Danger, that such\r\nKind of Fricas will frequently take Place in that Connection, upon\r\nwhich, much of my future Comfort in Life will depend. I am too well\r\nacquainted with the Liberality of your Way of thinking, to harbour such\r\na Jealousy; and I think I can trust to my Daughters Discretion if she\r\nwill only promise to exercise it. I feel myself at this Moment so\r\ndomestically disposd that I could say a thousand things to you, if I\r\nhad Leisure. I could dwell on the Importance of Piety & Religion, of\r\nIndustry & Frugality, of Prudence, AEconomy, Regularity & an even\r\nGovernment, all which are essential to the Well being of a Family. But\r\nI have not Time. I cannot however help repeating Piety, because I think\r\nit indispensible. Religion in a Family is at once its brightest\r\nOrnament & its best Security. The first Point of Justice, says a Writer\r\nI have met with, consists in Piety; Nothing certainly being so great a\r\nDebt upon us, as to render to the Creator & Preserver those\r\nAcknowledgments which are due to Him for our Being, and the hourly\r\nProtection he affords us.\r\n\r\nRemember me to all Friends, and be assured that I am\r\n\r\nYours\r\n\r\n1 A younger brother of Elizabeth Wells; he married the daughter of\r\nAdams.

ADAMS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADA Novr 24 1780\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BETSY\r\n\r\nYesterday I wrote to Mr Wells, and in haste because I was informd that\r\nDr Craigie was then instantly setting off for Boston. As he has waited\r\nanother Day, I have the Opportunity of acknowledging the Receipt of\r\nyour Letters of the 25th of October & the 8th of Novr which were\r\nbrought to me by the Post. You seem, my Dear, to express more Concern\r\nthan I think you ought, at certain Events that have of late taken Place\r\nin the Common Wealth of Massachusetts. Do you not consider that in a\r\nfree Republick, the People have an uncontroulable right of chusing whom\r\nthey please, to take their Parts in the Administration of publick\r\nAffairs? No Man has a Claim on his Country, upon the Score of his\r\nhaving renderd pub-lick Service. It is the Duty of every one to use his\r\nutmost Exertions in promoting the Cause of Liberty & Virtue; and having\r\nso done, if his Country thinks proper to call others to the arduous\r\nTask, he ought chearfully to acquiesce, and to console himself with the\r\nContemplations of an honest Man in private Life. You know, how ardently\r\nI have wishd for the Sweets of Retirement. I am like to have my Wish.--You\r\nare Witness that I have not raisd a Fortune in the Service of my\r\nCountry. I glory in being what the World calls, a poor Man. If my Mind\r\nhas ever been tinctured with Envy, the Rich and the Great have not been\r\nits objects. If I have been vain, Popularity, tho' I had as much of it\r\nas any Man ought to have, is not the Phantome I have pursued. He who\r\ngains the Approbation of the Virtuous Citizens. I will own, may feel\r\nhimself happy; but he is in Reality much more so, who knows he deserves\r\nit, Such a Man, if he cannot retreat with Splendor, he may with\r\ndignity. I will trust in that all gracious Being, who, in his own good\r\nWay, has provided us with Food and Raiment; and having spent the\r\ngreatest Part of my Life in Publick Cares, like the weary Traveller,\r\nfatigud with the Journey of the Day, I can rest with you in a Cottage.\r\nIf I live till the Spring, I will take my final Leave of Congress and\r\nreturn to Boston. I have Reasons to be fixed in this Determination\r\nwhich I will then explain to you. I grow more domestick as I increase\r\nin years.\r\n\r\nMy worthy Friend Mr Arthur Lee, who just now favord me with a Visit,\r\nsends Respects to you and the Family.\r\n\r\nI have forgot in my late Letters to tell you, that six Weeks ago,\r\nGeneral Ward & my self changd our Lodgings, and are at the House of Mrs\r\nMiller. She is a well bred Woman, and my Situation is agreable. Colo\r\nPalfrey who is with us is appointed Consul, and will soon go to France,\r\nwhen Mr Lovel will take the vacant Chamber. ---- Adieu my dear.\r\n\r\nYour affectionate,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ELBRIDGE GERRY.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library; the text, with variations, is\r\nin J. T. Austin, Life of Elbridge Gerry, vol. i., pp. 359-363.]\r\n\r\nPHILADE Novr 27 1780\r\n\r\nLet me intreat you, my dear Sir, not to think me unmindful of the\r\nseveral Favors I have receivd from you since I arrivd in this City. I\r\nhate Protestations among Friends, and the making Apologies is so formal\r\na Business, that I know not in what Manner to begin it. Yet it seems\r\nnecessary that I should say something in Excuse for my not having\r\nwritten to you. Shall I tell you of my trembling Hand, & how unfit an\r\nInstrument it is to guide a Pen? I do assure you that writing is on\r\nthat Account become painful to me. I am perswaded you never doubted the\r\nReality of my Friendship for you, and I solemnly affirm it has not\r\nabated a single Iota. Let this suffice on the Score of Apology, and\r\npermit me to hope that I shall receive your Letters frequently, while I\r\nremain here, which however will be only until next Spring. I shall then\r\ntake my final Leave of Congress, & seek that Retirement from publick\r\nCares, which my Country seems to point out for me, & to which my own\r\nInclination leads me.\r\n\r\nI perceive it has been in your Option to take a Seat in either House of\r\nthe General Assembly, or return to Congress. I cannot say in which of\r\nthese Departments you will have it in your Power to render the most\r\nsubstantial Service to the Publick. We feel the Want of you here; and\r\nyet I think you have wisely chosen a Seat for the present in the House\r\nof Representatives. Many Virtuous Men there may want that Information\r\nwhich you are able to give them. Possibly you may have much of the old\r\nGround to go over again. More in my Opinion, is necessary to be done,\r\nthan conquering our British Enemies in order to establish the Liberties\r\nof our Country on a solid Basis. Human Nature, I am affraid, is too\r\nmuch debas'd to relish those Republican Principles, in which the new\r\nGovernment of the Common Wealth of Massachusetts appears to be founded.\r\nAnd may it not be added, that the former Government, I mean the last\r\nCharter, being calculated rather to make servile Men than free\r\nCitizens, the Minds of many of our Countrymen have been inurd to a\r\ncringing Obsequiousness, too deeply wrought into Habit to be easily\r\neradicated? Mankind is prone enough to political Idolatry. Such a\r\ntemper is widely different from that reverence which every virtuous\r\nCitizen will show to the upright Magistrate. If my Fears on this Head\r\nare ill grounded, I hope I shall be excusd. They proceed from a cordial\r\nAffection for that Country to the Service of which I have devoted the\r\ngreatest Part of my Life--May Heaven inspire the present Rulers with\r\nWisdom & sound Understanding. In all Probability they will stamp the\r\nCharacter of the People. It is natural for sensible Observers to form\r\nan Estimate of the People from the Opinion they have of those whom they\r\nset up for their Legislators & Magistrates. And besides, if we look\r\ninto the History of Governors, we shall find that their Principles &\r\nManners have always had a mighty Influence on the People. Should Levity\r\n& Foppery ever be the ruling Taste of the Great, the Body of the People\r\nwould be in Danger of catching the Distemper, and the ridiculous Maxims\r\nof the one would become fashionable among the other. I pray God we may\r\nnever be addicted to Vanity & the Folly of Parade! Pomp & Show serve\r\nvery well to promote the Purposes of European & Asiatick grandeur, in\r\nCountries where the Mystery of Iniquity is carried to the highest\r\nPitch, & Millions are tame enough to believe that they are born for no\r\nother Purpose than to be subservient to the capricious Will of a single\r\nGreat Man or a few! It requires Council & sound Judgment to render our\r\nCountry secure in a flourishing Condition.--If Men of Wisdom & Knowledge,\r\nof Moderation & Temperance, of Patience Fortitude & Perseverance, of\r\nSobriety & true Republican Simplicity of Manners, of Zeal for the Honor\r\nof the Supreme Being & the Welfare of the Common Wealth--If Men possessd\r\nof these & other excellent Qualities are chosen to fill the Seats of\r\nGovernment we may expect that our Affairs will rest on a solid &\r\npermanent Foundation.\r\n\r\nI thank you my dear Sir, for mentioning my Family so affectionately in\r\none of your Letters. Oblige them with your Visits as often as you can.\r\nRemember me to Colo Orne, who, I have Reason to think is among my\r\nFriends. Adieu and believe me to be most sincerely\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADA Decr 17. 1780\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nI have written several Letters to you & Mr D1 since the 28th of June\r\nwhen I last arrivd in this City. I think I committed one to the Care of\r\nour Friend Mr Laurens, who is unfortunately carried to England. Mr\r\nPalfrey, who is the Bearer of this, is appointed Consul in France; and\r\nbesides his Consular Functions, he has it in charge to forward such\r\nCloathing Arms &c as are or may be procured there for the Use of our\r\nTroops. Great Exertions have been made the year past, in which old\r\nMassachusetts has borne her full Share, to be in Readiness to cooperate\r\nwith our Ally, in an Attempt to give our Invaders a decisive Blow. But\r\nthe second Division of the french Squadron being blockd up in Brest, &\r\na Reinforcement to the Enemy arriving from the West Indies, they have\r\nhad the Superiority at Sea. This was not our only Misfortune; for had\r\nthe whole naval Force arrivd which we expected, I am inclind to believe\r\nwe should have faild for Want of a Sufficiency of Powder. By an\r\nunpardonable Neglect in somebody, that essential Article was not sent,\r\nas it ought to have been, in Season. I have called it an unpardonable\r\nNeglect. It appears so to me. My Judgment, however, may be too severe.\r\nI confess, I feel much chagrind, while I think that any thing has been\r\nomitted which might have been done, to have finishd the War with a\r\nglorious Campaign. But Disappointments, tho vexatious, ought not to\r\ndisconcert us. They do not. No Difficulties should discourage us in the\r\nSupport of a Cause, so righteous in the Sight of Heaven as I believe\r\nours to be, and so interresting to Mankind. Our Creator has given us\r\nUnderstanding, - Strength of Body and a Country full of Provisions. We\r\nmust make a good Use of them, hoping that His blessing will crown our\r\nvirtuous Struggle. He helps those who make proper Exertions to help\r\nthemselves. Such Exertions are now making. The States are called upon\r\nfor an Army of 35,000 Men; and from past Experience of the great\r\nExpence, as well as Inutility of temporary Drafts, they are resolvd to\r\nhave a well appointed Army early in the Field & inlisted for the War.\r\nAnd effectual Measures are taken for the Purpose of providing Magazines\r\nin Season for its Subsistence. The People at large, as far as I can\r\nlearn, are as determind as ever to support their Independence, & for\r\nthat End to carry on the War with Vigor. If our Ally can furnish us\r\nwith a decided naval Superiority, I think there will be the fairest\r\nProspect of bringing this great Contest to a happy Conclusion the next\r\nyear.--Altho' the Enemy have gaind the Possession of Charleston, they have\r\nnot succeeded to their Wishes in that Quarter. They do not find the\r\nPeople so pliable as they flatterd themselves they should.\r\nNotwithstanding Cornwallis' boasting Letter to Lord George, of \"a\r\ncompleat Victory obtaind the 16th Instant by His Majesties Troops under\r\nmy Command, over the rebel southern Army,\" that brave Army checkd the\r\nProgress of the Troops under his Command on the 16th of August; and the\r\nMilitia have since, in several Instances, given him ample Proofs of a\r\nfirm Attachment to the pub-lick Cause, as well as Bravery and Alertness\r\nwhich he did not expect, and which I believe have disconcerted their\r\ngeneral Plan.--The Hands of those People, if not already, will very soon\r\nbe taught to war & their Fingers to fight.\r\n\r\nArnolds Conspiracy was to have wrought Wonders, but gracious Heaven\r\ndefeated it. We have so often seen in the Course of this Conflict, the\r\nremarkeable Interposition of divine Providence in our favor, as to\r\nconvince me, that the Attempts of our Enemies to subdue us, will be but\r\ngnawing a File.\r\n\r\nYour publick Letters have been well receivd. I have been favord with\r\nonly two from you since you left Boston. One was deliverd to me by my\r\nworthy patriotick Friend Mr A Lee, & the other by the Count de\r\nNoailles, who lately spent a few Days in this City. He appears to be a\r\nmost amiable young Nobleman, & I believe you have not said too much in\r\nthe great Character you have given him. The very short time he stayed\r\nhere & the Business I have been engagd in, prevented me the Honor,\r\nwhich I very much covetted, of conversing with him frequently.\r\n\r\nCongress have appointed Colo John Laurens Envoy extraordinary at the\r\nCourt of Versailes, & Mr Dana will be regularly informd that he is to\r\ngo to Russia.\r\n\r\nBefore I conclude I must let you know, that the Ship which was set up\r\nin Massachusetts while you was there, and which, it was proposd, should\r\nbe named, the Oceana,1 has since been compleatly finishd and is now\r\nafloat. Her Materials are acknowledgd to be of the best kind, & well\r\nput together. It is said she will make a prime Sailer if not too taunt\r\nmasted. Others say, that the Construction of her Hull is such as to\r\nrequire a lofty Sail. There are many Speculations about her. As I am\r\nnot a Judge in the Matter, I am prudently silent & hear the Opinions of\r\nthose who are Connoisseurs. All agree that her Owners have much at\r\nStake, & that it will be a very great Oversight in them if they should\r\never risque her with unskilfull or unprincipled Officers or Pilots.\r\n\r\nMy due Regards to Mr Dana, & be assured that I am very cordially his &\r\nyour Friend.\r\n\r\n1 The Massachusetts Constitution of 1780.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA Decr 20 1780\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR--\r\n\r\nMr Palfrey is just embarking, so I have only a few Moments to inform\r\nyou, that I have this Morning been conversing with an old Man and an\r\nold Whig, who has all his Days been an Inhabitant of South Carolina &\r\nGeorgia. He was taken Prisoner last Summer & carried to New York, from\r\nwhence he lately came to this Place. And though his Fortune would\r\nenable him to live here at Ease, he thinks he can be useful to America\r\nby returning to that Part of it, and at the Age of 73 has undertaken\r\nthe long Journey. He has always mixed with the People of those States,\r\n& is well acquainted with their Temper & Sentiments. He also has been\r\nmuch among the Indians & is greatly beloved by them. This Account I\r\nhave had of him often from the Delegates of Georgia & others whom I can\r\nconfide in. The old Gentleman tells me that the People of those States\r\nare in general firmly attachd to the American Cause, & most fervently\r\ndeprecate their being finally seperated from the United States. His\r\nSoul was refreshd to hear me say that I did not apprehend any Danger of\r\nit--that the Idea would, in my Opinion, be abominated by the Eastern\r\nStates, and, as far as I could judge, by all the rest. He says, that\r\nthe Creeks & the Chictaws, which are the most numerous tribes of\r\nIndians, consisting of at least 8 perhaps 10 thousand Gun men, are our\r\nstaunch Friends. The Heads of them have lately spoken to him in this\r\nLanguage, \"We stand on the same Ground with you, we drink the same\r\nWater, breathe the same Air.. you are the Buds, & can there be Fruit if\r\nthe Buds are nipped off?\" These are forceable Words, which express\r\ntheir own Sense of the Necessity of their Union with us for their very\r\nExistence. They are a sagacious as well as a powerfull People, & an\r\nAlliance & Friendship with them is of Importance to all the United\r\nStates. The People, of whatever Nation, who shall possess Georgia &\r\nSouth Carolina, will be, the Leaves of their Trees. It is my Opinion,\r\nthat even a Thought of leaving the Inhabitants of those States to be\r\nsubject to any foreign Power, who so gallantly defended themselves in\r\nthe Beginning of this Contest, & have lately sufferd so much for the\r\nSake of American Liberty, would not only be unjust to them, but in a\r\nhigh Degree impolitick.\r\n\r\nIn every view we see the Necessity of a sufficient Naval Force. A few\r\nShips of War at the Bar of Charlestown, & a Frigate or two in Stone\r\nRiver, might at this time effect the Recovery of that City. I need not\r\ninform you, what an Effect the Sight of a Sixty Gun Ship would probably\r\nhave at Penobscott.-- Do not our Enemies conceive the Idea of Uti\r\npossidetis? And can there be Peace in America while Britain holds a\r\nFoot of Ground in any Part of it?\r\n\r\nAdieu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN SCOLLAY.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library; a portion of the text, with\r\nmodifications, is in W.

The\r\nPost has been very irregular of late, & our Letters grow old before we\r\nreceive them. It is a Shame that the Mail has been catchd a second time\r\nin the same trap. I inclosd to you a Warrant on Mr Appleton for the\r\nAmount of your Demand for boarding the Orphans of our late Friend Genl\r\nWarren. I think I did not send the Letter by that Post. But being\r\nuncertain I informd you in a subsequent Letter of my having sent the\r\nWarrant, and desired you to inform me whether it had come safely to\r\nhand. I expect to hear from you in Answer to my last at least, & shall\r\nthen conduct the Matter if necessary, as you have proposd.\r\n\r\nOur Government, I perceive, is organizd on the Basis of the new\r\nConstitution. I am affraid there is more Pomp & Parade than is\r\nconsistent with those sober Republican Principles, upon which the\r\nFramers of it thought they had founded it. Why should this new AEra be\r\nintroducd with Entertainments expensive & tending to dissipate the\r\nMinds of the People? Does it become us to lead the People to such\r\npublick Diversions as promote Superfluity of Dress & Ornament, when it\r\nis as much as they can bear to support the Expense of cloathing a naked\r\nArmy? Will Vanity & Levity ever be the Stability of Government, either\r\nin States, in Cities, or what, let me hint to you is of the last\r\nImportance, in Families? Of what Kind are those Manners, by which, as\r\nwe are truly informd in a late Speech, \"not only the freedom but the\r\nvery Existence of Republicks is greatly affected?\" HOW fruitless is it,\r\nto recommend \"the adapting the Laws in the most perfect Manner\r\npossible, to the Suppression of Idleness Dissipation & Extravagancy,\"\r\nif such Recommendations are counteracted by the Example of Men of\r\nReligion, Influence & publick Station? I meant to consider this Subject\r\nin the View of the mere Citizen. But I have mentiond the sacred Word\r\nReligion. I confess, I am surprizd to hear, that some particular\r\nPersons have been so unguarded as to give their Countenance to such\r\nkind of Amusements. I wish Mr ---- would recollect his former Ideas when his\r\nFriend Whitfield thunderd in the Pulpit against Assemblies & Balls. I\r\nthink he has disclaimd Diversions, in some Instances, which to me have\r\nalways appeard innocent. Has he changd his Opinions, or has the\r\nTendency of things alterd? Do certain Manners tend to quench the Spirit\r\nof Religion at one time & are they harmless at another? Are Morals so\r\nvague as to be sanctified or dispens'd with by the Authority of\r\ndifferent Men? He does not believe this. But I will not be severe, for\r\nI love my Friend. Religion out of the Question for the present. It was\r\nasked in the Reign of Charles the 2d of England, HOW shall we turn the\r\nMinds of the People from an Attention to their Liberties? The Answer\r\nwas, by making them extravagant, luxurious, effeminate. Hutchinson\r\nadvisd the Abridgment of what our People called English Liberties, by\r\nthe same Means. We shall never subdue them, said Bernard, but by\r\neradicating their Manners & the Principles of their Education. Will the\r\njudicious Citizens of Boston be now caught in the Snare, which their\r\nartful, insidious Enemies, a few years ago laid for them in vain? Shall\r\nwe ruin ourselves by the very means, which they pointed out in their\r\nConfidential Letters, tho even they did not dare openly to avow them?\r\nPownal, who was indeed a mere Fribble, venturd to have his Riots &\r\nRouts at his own house, to please a few Boys & Girls. Sober People were\r\ndisgusted at it, & his privy Councellors never thought it prudent to\r\nventure so far as expensive Balls. Our Bradfords, Winslows & Winthrops\r\nwould have revolted at the Idea of opening Scenes of Dissipation &\r\nFolly; knowing them to be inconsistent with their great Design, in\r\ntransplanting themselves into what they called this \"Outside of the\r\nWorld.\" But I fear I shall say too much. I love the People of Boston. I\r\nonce thought, that City would be the Christian Sparta. But Alas! Will\r\nmen never be free! They will be free no longer than while they remain\r\nvirtuous. Sidney tells us, there are times when People are not worth\r\nsaving. Meaning, when they have lost their Virtue. I pray God, this may\r\nnever be truly said of my beloved Town. Adieu. My Respects to Mrs\r\nScollay & Family & believe me to be sincerely\r\n\r\nYour Friend\r\n\r\nIf Mr B A 1 thinks a Question from me worth his answering, ask him\r\nwhether he has lost some value-able Books which I have seen in his\r\nLibrary, the Works of our illustrious Forefathers.\r\n\r\n1 Benjamin Austin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1781\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO RICHARD HENRY LEE.\r\n\r\n[MS., Lee Papers, American Philosophical Society.]\r\n\r\nPHILADE Jany 15th 1781\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nYour second Letter came to hand in due Season. My much Esteemed Friend\r\nMr Arthur Lee will take the Charge of this. I will say to you as I have\r\nsaid to my Boston Friends, who are sollicitous to know what Treatment\r\nhe meets with here. The more I have conversd with him, the more I have\r\nbeen confirmd in a good opinion of him, and lamented the Mistakes and\r\nPrejudices of some Men & the Wickedness of others. His Enemies, I\r\nthink, dare not openly attack his Reputation or Conduct. But the\r\nWhispers of Envy & Malice, have sometimes Influence enough to prevent\r\nthe Justice due to the virtuous Citizen. When this is the Case, it\r\naffords a Symptom of the Decay of publick Spirit, more threatning to\r\nthe Liberties of a Common Wealth than Hosts of foreign Enemies.\r\nMonarchs have their Favorites who serve as Pimps on their honest\r\nSubjects. But Republicks should examine the Conduct of their Servants\r\nwith an impartial Eye; and it discovers the Want of pub-lick Virtue, as\r\nmuch, to withhold their Smiles from the wise and good as to bestow them\r\non the wicked & unfaithful. Mr Lee has as yet had neither Smiles nor\r\nFrowns. I am still in hopes, he will meet with the Rewards which I am\r\nsure he would have receivd if he had returnd a few years ago. He will\r\nhave them, when the Trustees of the Publick shall have Fortitude\r\nenough, to be uninfluencd by great Names & Characters given to Men of\r\nbase & depraved Minds. You will ask, when that will be. Perhaps not in\r\nthis Age. But the Historian will in some future time draw forth the\r\nProofs of his Patriotism, & unprejudicd Posterity will acknowledge that\r\nArthur Lee has borne a great Share in defending & establishing the\r\nLiberties of America. I say Posterity; for I believe that a wiser\r\nGeneration will enjoy the Fruits of the Toil of Patriots & Heroes in\r\nthe present Day.\r\n\r\nMy Friend, we must not suffer any thing to discourage us in this great\r\nConflict. Let us recur to first Principles without Delay. It is our\r\nDuty, to make every proper Exertion in our respective States to revive\r\nthe old patriotick Feelings among the People at large, and to get the\r\npublick Departments, especially the most important of them, filled with\r\nMen of Understanding & inflexible Virtue. It would be indeed alarming,\r\nif the United States should ever entrust the Ship in which our all is\r\nat Stake, with inexperiencd or unprincipled Pilots. Our Cause is surely\r\ntoo interesting to Mankind, to be put under the Direction of Men, vain,\r\navaricious or conceald under the Hypocritical Guise of Patriotism,\r\nwithout a Spark of publick or private Virtue. We may possibly be more\r\nin Danger of this, than many of our honest Citizens may imagine. Is\r\nthere not Reason to apprehend, that even those who are inimical to our\r\nCause may steal into Places of the highest Trust? I need not remind you\r\nthat Men of this Character have had Seats in Congress from the\r\nbegining. Where is Galloway, LOW, Allen & Alexander?--If it was so in\r\nthose Times of Vigilance & Zeal, how much more is it to be expected,\r\nwhen the Love of many is waxen cold, & their Minds are distracted with\r\nthe Pursuit of Pleasure & exorbitant Riches. We cannot be perswaded to\r\nbelieve that bad Men have been sent by their States with a View of\r\ngiving a fatal Stab to our Cause in its Infancy; but is it unreasonable\r\nto suppose that their Elections were secretly influencd by artful Men,\r\nwith that Design. Our most dangerous Enemies may be in our Bosoms.\r\n\r\nMr Lee will inform you how Matters go on here.\r\n\r\nI must let you know that when your Kinsman Mr William Lee was in Boston\r\nin Sept 1779 he borrowed five hundred Dollars of Moses Gill Esqr, and\r\ndrew his Bill on his Brother Mr George Lee of Westmoreland County. I\r\nwish it may be paid on Sight, for it was advancd on my Application.\r\n\r\nMy Regards to Mrs Lee &c. Adieu & believe me to be\r\n\r\nYour Friend\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN PITTS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILAD. Jany 17 1781\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nYour favor of the 17th of Novr was duly receivd. It bodes very ill to\r\nGovernment when Men are exalted to places of high trust through their\r\nown Sollicitations. He only fills a place with Dignity, who is invited\r\nto it by his Fellow Citizens, from the Experience they have had of his\r\nadequate Abilities, & who does the Duties of it with Zeal & Fidelity.\r\nSuch a Man, being conscious that neither Smiles, Intreaties, Gifts,\r\nIntrigue nor any dishonorable Practices have procured him his high\r\nStation, may rely on the People who gave him their free Suffrages, to\r\napprove of his honest Endeavors to serve them. And having Nothing in\r\nView but that the Publick may be best servd, he will chearfully resign\r\nhis Place whenever the People shall make Choice of another whom they\r\njudge more capable than he. The People are certainly the best Judges,\r\nwho are most likely to render them substantial Service; & whoever\r\ninterposes in their Elections, with his own Sollicitations for himself,\r\nit is to be feard, if he is of any Consequence, will in time become a\r\ndangerous Party Man. He ought therefore to be despisd as an obtruder. I\r\nhope there are not many such Men in our Government. I am sorry to be\r\ninformd that there are any. They should be watchd; for if they have no\r\nevil Designs, their Vanity may prompt them to do Mischief. The Express\r\nwaits. Adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES WARREN.\r\n\r\n [MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADE Feb 1st 1781--\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nI have not had Leisure to write to you since the 20th of Novr. Indeed I\r\nam not willing to trust a Confidential Letter to the Post, which has\r\nshamefully been catchd in the same Trap more than once. I gladly\r\nembrace the opportunity by Mr Otis, with whom I have had frequent &\r\ncandid Conversations concerning Men & Things. He will be able to tell\r\nyou some Truths which I do not think it prudent to commit to Paper. You\r\n& I have been long struggling for the Liberty of our Country. I believe\r\nits Independence will be finally acknowledgd by the World. But are not\r\nmany Nations England in particular called Independent? And do you think\r\nthe People of England are free. No People, in my opinion can be long\r\nfree who are not virtuous; and it is no Sign of Virtue, when the\r\nCouncils of an enlightned Country are directed by a foreign Influence.\r\nIf I were a Minister at a foreign Court, my Vanity might be flatterd,\r\nin imagining that by having Address enough to rule its Measures, I\r\nmight fix myself in the Esteem and Confidence of my Country, but I\r\nshould entertain a contemptible Opinion of the Wisdom & Virtue of that\r\nCourt if it would suffer me to do it. The Councils of a Nation must be\r\nweak in the extreme, or it must be reducd to the greatest Degree of\r\nDependence to submit to so servile a Condition. You will not think I\r\nhave the remotest Reference in what I now say, jealous as I allow my\r\nself to be, to the Amphictyon of the United States of America. It is\r\npresumd they will always have too high a Sense of their Dignity to\r\nsuffer themselves & their Nation to be degraded. But when Peace is\r\nhappily settled & a Number of foreign Ministers are about our Court, it\r\nwill require Men of great Knowledge of the World & Experience in\r\nAffairs to penetrate their various Intrigues. I have been assured that\r\nthe Court of France would be highly disgusted with any of its Ministers\r\nif they should improperly interfere in our Councils; and indeed when I\r\nconsider the Jealousy of a rising Republick, I think nothing would\r\nequal the Impolicy of their attempting it, but the Imprudence of\r\nCongress in submitting to it. ---- But I am unexpectedly called off and Mr\r\nOtis is just going. I intended to have written to you largely but must\r\nomit it till the next opportunity. Pray inform my worthy Friend Capt\r\nBradford that I must also omit writing to him, as I intended, for the\r\nsame Reason.\r\n\r\nyour affectionate,\r\n\r\nTO MRS. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADE Feb. 1st 1781\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BETSY\r\n\r\nMy last was by Major Clarkson. He is a young officer of military Merit.\r\nI wish you would entertain him with a Dish of Tea.\r\n\r\nOur new AEra of Government, I fancy, has occasiond a Revolution in\r\npolitical Circles & a Change of Connections. I cannot otherwise account\r\nfor the long Silence of my Friend Doctor Cooper. I used to correspond\r\nwith him very confidentially. We indeed thought aloud together. But I\r\nhave receivd only one Letter from him since I left Boston, which was\r\ndeliverd to me by Mr A Lee. I considerd it as a Compliment to that most\r\ndeserving Patriot, rather than a Letter of Friendship to me. I have\r\nwritten several Times to him, & once desired particular Information,\r\nwhich he might have given me without offending any Man, but he has not\r\ndone it. I hope the Doctor does not think his Letters troublesome to\r\nme. He has no Reason to think so. But, he chuses to close the\r\nCorrespondence, & you know, that I am disposd on such Occasions, to\r\nretaliate. It sometimes affects my Feelings, but I shall never be in\r\nDebt on that Score. You may let the Dr read this Letter if he pleases,\r\nbut no other Person; for when I think amiss of the private Conduct of a\r\nFriend, I let none know it, but him & you. Indeed I shall say nothing\r\nto you at present that I would not wish him to know. I employ no Pimps\r\nor Spies on my Fellow Citizens, & yet I hear of many things that are\r\nsaid & done in Boston. I may sometimes be misinformd, & I am always\r\ninclind to think I am, when I cannot reconcile what is said with the\r\nHonor & Integrity of Friendship. If Mr W C1 has \"spoken very\r\ndisrespectfully\" of me, I am sorry for him. It gives me no Pain on my\r\nAccount because I deserve not his reproach. I know he is apt to be\r\nsanguine in his Opinions of Men, & his Zeal in Elections has been\r\ncommendable. But as I did not interest myself at all in the late\r\nElections he might have spared me. I have candidly declared, when I was\r\nasked in Boston, who I thought to be most endowd with those great\r\nQualities, which should characterize the first Magistrate of so\r\nrespectable a Commonwealth. This is the Right, it is the Duty of every\r\nCitizen. And had I been present, I should most certainly have voted for\r\nthat Candidate. I may have been mistaken in my Judgment; and, as it\r\nbecomes a Citizen, I will, acquiesce in the Choice of a Majority of the\r\nPeople, who ought to know & prefer the fittest Person. If they do not,\r\nthey are hardly worthy to be servd by any Man. I hope we shall never\r\nfall into those Dregs of Time, when it shall be the Custom for one\r\nCitizen to treat another ill, merely because a popular Man has markd\r\nhim as his Enemy, or because others, for servile Purposes, have\r\nreported him as such. This may afford Sport for the Enemies of our\r\nCause, who are laying the Snare with great Art & Industry. James\r\nRivington has publishd in his Royal Gazette, that the Acrimony between\r\nMr Hancock & me, was owing to his Attachment to General Washington, &\r\nmy being on the Contrary, desirous of his Removal. This is an old Story\r\nwhich Men have believd and disbelievd as they pleasd, without much\r\nConcern of mine. It was a pityful Contrivance to render me obnoxious to\r\nthe General & our common Friends. If there has been any Difference\r\nbetween Mr H and me, Rivington knows not the Origin of it. Mr Hancock\r\nnever thought me an Enemy to Genl Washington. He never thought that I\r\nwas desirous of his being removd, & therefore could never treat me with\r\nAcrimony on that Account. I never wishd for the Removal of General\r\nWashington, but if I had even attempted to effect it, it might have\r\nbeen an Evidence of my Deficiency in Judgment, or Rashness, but it\r\ncould be no Evidence that I was his Enemy. Mr W C may think that I am\r\nan Enemy to Mr Hancock, because he may have heard that I preferd\r\nanother as a Governor before him. At this Rate, I must be thought an\r\nEnemy to every Man to whom I cannot give the Preference for an exalted\r\nStation for which few of the Many can be supposd to be qualified.\r\nRidiculous [&] mischievous as this is, I am told that some carry their\r\nopinions further and that it is not enough, that a Man who cannot\r\nconsistently vote for a Governor is to be reckon'd his Enemy, but he is\r\nfor this Reason to be excluded from every Department. Who could wish to\r\nhold a Seat in Government on so slavish a Tenure? The People of\r\nMassachusetts under the old Government have seen enough of the\r\nmischievous Effects of the Governors having a Power to negative\r\nElections & I cannot see the Difference between this & his being able\r\nto influence or prevent an Election by causing it to be believd that a\r\nCandidate is his Enemy. He who gives his Suffrage according to the\r\nDictates of a well informd Judgment, is certainly a virtuous Citizen.\r\nAnd is it to be supposd that such a Man would withhold his Influence in\r\nfavor of a wise Measure, because a Gentleman is placed in the Chair by\r\nhis Fellow Citizens, whom he did not vote for? Such a Supposition\r\nsavours so much of a Narrow, illiberal party Spirit, that I should\r\nthink no intelligent Man would countenance it. If it should prevail, it\r\nwould produce evil Consequences; for some Men, if they are made to\r\nbelieve their political Existence depends on their being thought the\r\nGovernors Friends, will not easily prevail on themselves to risque that\r\nExistence by giving him Advice, however salutary it might be, &\r\nnecessary for the Honor & Safety of the Commonwealth, if they think it\r\nwill disgust him.\r\n\r\nYou may wonder, my Dear, that I send this Budget of Politicks to you. I\r\nsee no Reason why a Man may not communicate his political opinions to\r\nhis Wife, if he pleases. But to tell you the truth I consider this\r\nEpistle, after the License I have already given you, as indirectly\r\naddressd to the Friend I have mentiond. I would gladly know his\r\nopinion, Whether there is not more Parade among our Gentry than is\r\nconsistent with sober republican Principles. Is it to imitate the\r\nVanity of former times that every order of Men have been so fond of\r\naddressing the Governor? Are we to pay the same Ceremonies to the next\r\n& the next? Will not such high Strains of Panegyrick injure the\r\nFeelings of modest Men? And if there should happen to be a weak Man,\r\nwill they not make him intollerably vain? Republicks should adopt the\r\nRule of another Society. The Yea should be Yea, and the Nay, Nay, for\r\nwhatsoever is more than these cometh of Evil. Adieu.\r\n\r\n1 William Cooper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA Mar. 15 1781\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BETSY\r\n\r\nMr Bagnal, the Bearer of this Letter, this Moment informs me, that he\r\nsets off in half an hour for Boston I am sorry he did not give me more\r\ntimely Notice, because I chuse to write to my Confidential Friends by\r\nprivate Hands rather than the Post. I have in a Letter forwarded\r\nyesterday, given Notice to the General Assembly, of my Wish to return\r\nhome as early as may be and requested to be relievd by one of my\r\nColleagues or otherwise as may be thought proper. I expect to have\r\nGeneral Wards Servant to attend me on my Journey. He is afterwards to\r\nreturn here. I am much concernd at the Dissentions in the New South\r\nSociety, who have generally been remarkeable for Peace & Harmony. They\r\nshould strive for a conciliatory Spirit as far as is consistent with\r\ngood Conscience, condescend to each other in smaller Matters, and bear\r\nwith each others Tempers. I have not been unmindful of my Sons\r\nSituation, as mentiond in his Letter to me some time ago. He will see\r\nby the Journals of Congress (Sept. 30, 1780) that the officers in the\r\nMedical Department, are intitled annually to draw Cloathing from the\r\nStores of the Cloathier General in the same Manner & under the same\r\nRegulations as are establishd for officers of the Line by a Resolution\r\nNovr 25, 1779-- such Cloathing to be deliverd by the Cloathier General or\r\nany sub Cloathier in the State in which the officer to receive the\r\nCloathing shall reside. I have sent the Journals of the Dates above\r\nmentiond, and wish Mr Davis or some other of my Friends would speak to\r\nMr Ruggles, who I think is the Sub Cloathier in the State, in Behalf of\r\nmy Son. I hope however that the Matter is already settled, & he gone to\r\nNewport. I am uneasy at his being absent from his Station any length of\r\nTime; for however necessary it may be, it may be turnd to the\r\nDisadvantage of his Character, which if I am not flatterd, he has\r\nhitherto kept unsullied. In this virtuous & important Struggle, he will\r\nremember that all of us must ruff it as well as we can.----The medical\r\nCommittee inform me that it is the Duty of the State Cloathier to\r\nfurnish him without the intervention of the Commander in Chiefe or\r\nBoard of War.\r\n\r\nPray let Mrs Fogs know that Mr Level & I have done all we could for the\r\nRelease of her Son who was made a Sea Prisoner & carried to New York.\r\nOur officers have some of them been sent to England, but not any of the\r\nSeamen, so that it is hoped he is still there. Many of them have died.\r\nThey have lately been better treated than they were some time ago. The\r\nBritish Sea Officers are retaind in close Confinement here till we hear\r\nwhat is become of ours. We are in hopes there will soon be an Exchange\r\nof the whole.\r\n\r\nRemember me to Friends----Adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE, UNSIGNED.\r\n\r\n[Boston Gazette, April 2, 1781; a draft is in the Samuel Adams Papers,\r\nLenox Library.1]\r\n\r\nExtract of a Letter from the Southward.\r\n\r\n\"As we have a Constitution which is admired for its genuine Principles,\r\nI have been sollicitous to know, whether our Countrymen at large\r\npartook of the Spirit of those who formed it. I have conceived strong\r\nHopes, that in organizing their Government and electing Persons to fill\r\nthe important Places of Trust, no Consideration would avail, to govern\r\ntheir Suffrages in Favour of any Candidate, unless he was possessed of\r\nthose Qualities which are necessary, to enable him to perform the\r\nDuties of the Office to be filled, to the Advantage of the Publick. I\r\nhave flattered my self, that both the Governors and the Governed would\r\nhave lain aside the gawdy Trappings of Monarchy, and put on that\r\nSimplicity which is the Ornament and Strength of a free Republick. HOW\r\nfar it has been done, I am not able to judge at this Distance. It is a\r\ngreat Satisfaction to me to be informed, that some of the best Men in\r\nthe Commonwealth have been elected into the Principal Departments of\r\nGovernment. Men, who will dignify the Character of our Country--who will\r\nrevive and disseminate those Principles, moral and political, to\r\npropagate which, our Ancestors transplanted themselves into this new\r\nWorld--Men who by the Wisdom of their Councils and their exemplary\r\nManners, will establish the public Liberty on the Foundation of a\r\nRock.--These Men will secure to themselves more of the Esteem of their\r\nvirtuous, and even of their vicious Fellow-Citizens, than they could by\r\na thousand courtly Addresses which are commonly the Breath of Vanity\r\nand Adulation.--There is a charm in Virtue to force Esteem.--If Men of a\r\ndifferent Character have by any Means been advanced to those hallow'd\r\nSeats, who have even sollicited public Employments to give a Scope to\r\nViews of Ambition and Avarice, Passions which have in all Ages been the\r\nBane of human Society; or, to gratify the raging Thirst for popular\r\nApplause, a Disease with which little minds are usually tormented, it\r\nis our Happiness that the Constitution requires annual Elections, and\r\nsuch Mistakes may be corrected at the next.\r\n\r\n\"I was sorry to hear, that the Number of Votes returned, the last Time,\r\ndid not amount to a Quarter of the Number of qualified Electors in the\r\nCommonwealth. The Choice of Legislators, Magistrates and Governors, is\r\nsurely a Business of the greatest Moment, and claims the Attention of\r\nevery Citizen. The Framers of our Constitution, while they gave due\r\nAttention to Political were not forgetful of Civil Liberty--that personal\r\nFreedom and those Rights of Property, which the meanest Citizen is\r\nintitled to, and the Security of which is the great End of political\r\nSociety. It was not indeed their Province to make particular Laws for\r\nthese Purposes. To do this, and to provide for the equal and impartial\r\nExecution of such Laws, agreeable to the Constitution, is the Duty of\r\nthe Legislature. Hence every Citizen will see, and I hope will be\r\ndeeply impressed with a Sense of it, how exceedingly important it is to\r\nhimself, and how intimately the welfare of his Children is connected\r\nwith it, that those who are to have a Share in making as well as in\r\njudging and executing the Laws should be Men of singular Wisdom and\r\nIntegrity. Such as are conscious that they are deficient in either of\r\nthese Qualities, should even TREMBLE at being named as Candidates! I\r\nhope the great Business of Elections will never be left by the Many, to\r\nbe done by the Few; for before we are aware of it, that few may become\r\nthe Engine of Corruption--the Tool of a Junto.--Heaven forbid! that our\r\nCountrymen should ever be byass'd in their Choice, by unreasonable\r\nPredilections for any man, or that an Attachment to the Constitution,\r\nas has been the Case in other Countries, should be lost in Devotion to\r\nPersons. The Effect of this would soon be, to change the Love of\r\nLiberty into the Spirit of Faction. Let each Citizen remember, at the\r\nMoment he is offering his Vote, that he is not making a Present or a\r\nCompliment to please an Individual, or at least that he ought not so to\r\ndo; but that he is executing one of the most solemn Trusts in human\r\nSociety, for which he is accountable to GOD and his Country.\r\n\r\n\"When the great Body of the People are determined not to be imposed\r\nupon by a false Glare of Virtues held before their Eyes, but, making up\r\ntheir own Minds, shall impartially give in their Suffrages, after their\r\nbest Enquiries into the Characters of Candidates, for those whom they\r\njudge to be the fittest Persons, there will be no Danger that the\r\ngenerous Enthusiasm of Freedom, so characteristic of the People of\r\nMassachusetts, will ever sink into the Violence and Rage of Party,\r\nwhich has often proved fatal to free Republicks.\"\r\n\r\n1 Endorsed by Adams: \"The foregoing was sent to Mr Edes by the Post\r\nMarch 13, 1781.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CALEB DAVIS1\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADE April 3 1781\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR /\r\n\r\nI have just receivd your favor of the 17th Ulto by Mr Dugan. The\r\nRequest he proposes to make to Congress for Liberty to bring his\r\nEffects from Ireland, cannot be complied with consistently with the\r\ninclosd ordinance, which strictly forbids all Intercourse between the\r\nCitizens of the United States & the Subjects of Great Britain. There\r\nhave been so many undue Advantages taken from Indulgences of this Kind,\r\nas to render the Continuance of them unsafe to us and disgustful to our\r\nAlly. I shall always pay a due Regard to your Recommendations, and\r\nshould have been particularly desirous of rendering Service to your\r\nFriend Mr Dugan whom I personally know & of whose Integrity I have no\r\nReason to doubt.\r\n\r\nYour Letter of the 23d of Feby never came to hand; and I regret it the\r\nmore, because you tell me, you then wrote fully of the State of Affairs\r\nin Boston which I should have been glad to have receivd. Let me observe\r\nto you as a private Friend, the Delegates of Massachusetts are by no\r\nmeans duly informd of what is done in their own State; & when they\r\nreceive any kind of Information, it is not in a Manner adapted to give\r\nthem Weight. I do not mention this on my own Account; for I intend very\r\nsoon to take Leave of Congress & get myself excusd from any future\r\nAttendance. I will then explain the Hint I have now given you, more\r\nfully than I chuse to do in a Letter by the Post. You mention a certain\r\nJuncture when you wish me to return. I think I can discover your Motive\r\nand your old Partiality for me. I do assure you, I am not at all\r\nsollicitous about any thing of the Kind which your Letter seems to\r\nintimate. I have always endeavord to confine my Desires in this Life\r\nwithin moderate Bounds, and it is time for me to reduce them to a\r\nnarrower Compass. You speak of \"Neglect,\" \"Ingratitude\" &c. But let us\r\nentertain just Sentiments. A Citizen owes everything to the\r\nCommonwealth. And after he has made his utmost Exertions for its\r\nProsperity, has he done more than his Duty? When Time enfeebles his\r\nPowers & renders him unfit for further Service, his Country, to\r\npreserve its own Vigour will wisely call upon others; and if he\r\ndecently retreats to make Room for them he will show that he has not\r\nyet totally lost his Understanding. Besides, there is a Period in Life\r\nwhen a Man should covet the exalted Pleasure of Reflection in\r\nRetirement.\r\n\r\nI thank you, my dear Sir, for the information you gave Mrs A of Mr\r\nDugans coming. Pray let her know that I receivd her Letter & am well.\r\nMy Compts to the Circle about you.\r\n\r\nYour affectionate,\r\n\r\n1 Speaker of the House of Representatives of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE, UNSIGNED.\r\n\r\n[Boston Gazette, April 16, 1781; a draft is in the Samuel Adams Papers,\r\nLenox Library.1]\r\n\r\nExtract of a Letter from the Southward.\r\n\r\n\"BEFORE this will reach you, your Countrymen will have finished the\r\nimportant business of electing their Legislators, Magistrates and\r\nGovernors for the ensuing year. I hope they have made a wise choice. At\r\nleast, from the opinion I entertain of their virtue, I am persuaded\r\nthey have acted with all that deliberation and caution which the\r\nsolemnity of the transaction required. They may then reflect, each one\r\non his own integrity, and appeal to the Monitor within his breast, that\r\nhe has not trifled with the sacred trust reposed in him by GOD and his\r\ncountry--that he has not prostituted his honor and conscience to please a\r\nfriend or a patron --that he has not been influenced with the view of\r\nprivate emolument to himself and his family, but has faithfully given\r\nhis vote for the candidate whom he thought most worthy the choice of\r\nfree and virtuous citizens--I congratulate that Legislator, Magistrate &\r\nGovernor, who knows that neither smiles, entreaties, gifts,\r\ndissimulation, intrigue, nor any base and dishonorable practices have\r\nprocured him this exalted station. His fellow citizens, unsollicited by\r\nhim, have called him into their service, from the opinion they have\r\nformed of his integrity and adequate abilities.--He feels himself happy in\r\ntheir opinion of him--happy is he indeed, if he is conscious he deserves\r\nit.\r\n\r\nBut our countrymen will not imagine, that having filled the several\r\ndepartments of government, they have no further concern about it. It\r\nis, I humbly conceive, their duty and interest to attend to the manner\r\nin which it is administered by those whom they have entrusted. HOW\r\noften has the finishing stroke been given to public virtue, by those\r\nwho possessed, or seemed to possess many amiable virtues? GUSTAVUS VASA\r\nwas viewed by the Swedes as the deliverer of their country from the\r\nDanish yoke. The most implicit obedience, says the historian, was\r\nconsidered by them as a debt of gratitude, and a virtue. He had many\r\nexcellent qualities. His manners were conciliating--His courage and\r\nabilities great--But the people by an entire confidence in him suffered\r\nhim to lay a foundation for absolute monarchy. They were charmed with\r\nhis moderation and wisdom, qualities which he really possessed; but\r\nthey did not consider his ambition, nor had they a thought of his\r\nviews. They found peace restored, order established, justice\r\nadministered, commerce protected, and the arts and sciences encouraged,\r\nand they looked no further. They did not imagine, that he who had been\r\nthe instrument of recovering the independence of their country, could\r\nbe the very man who was to effect the ruin of their liberties. By the\r\nConstitution of Sweden their kings were elective, and the powers of the\r\ncrown were exceedingly limited. The unsuspecting people even\r\nvoluntarily gave up their right of election, and suffered Gustavus to\r\nenlarge the powers of the crown, and entail it in his own family! This\r\nis the account which the history of Sweden has given us; and it affords\r\nan instance among a thousand others, of the folly and danger of\r\ntrusting even good men with power, without regarding the use they make\r\nof it. Power is in its nature incroaching; and such is the human make,\r\nthat men who are vested with a share of it, are generally inclined to\r\ntake more than it was intended they should have. The love of power,\r\nlike the love of money, increases with the possession of it; and we\r\nknow, in what ruin these baneful passions have involved human societies\r\nin all ages, when they have been let loose and suffered to rage\r\nuncontrouled-- There is no restraint like the pervading eye of the\r\nvirtuous citizens.--I hope therefore our countrymen will constantly\r\nexercise that right which the meanest of them is intitled to, and which\r\nis particularly secured to them by our happy constitution, of inquiring\r\nfreely, but decently, into the conduct of the public servants. The very\r\nbeing of the Commonwealth may depend upon it. I will venture to appeal\r\nto the experience of ancient Republicks, to evince the necessity of it;\r\nand it is never more necessary than in the infancy of a Commonwealth,\r\nand when the people have chosen honest men to conduct their affairs.\r\nFor, whatever is done at a time nearly contemporary with the\r\nconstitution, will be construed as the best exposition of it; and a\r\nmistaken principle of a virtuous ruler, whose public conduct is\r\ngenerally good, and always supposed to be honestly intended, carries\r\nwith it an authority scarcely to be resisted, and precedents are thus\r\nformed which may prove dangerous--perhaps fatal.\"--\r\n\r\n1 Endorsed by Adams: \"The foregoing was sent to Mr Edes by the Post Mar\r\n27, 81.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SAMUEL COOPER.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nPHILADE Apr 23 1781\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nI did not receive your favor of the 3d Instt till yesterday; a week\r\nlater than Letters of the same Date from some others of my Boston\r\nfriends were brought to me by the Post. As the Subject is delicate, I\r\ndo not chuse to continue it in this Letter, which is to go thro a\r\nChannel provd from repeated Experience to be uncertain & unsafe. It was\r\nfor this Reason that I committed to the Care of a private friend, my\r\nLetter to Mrs A of the 1st of Feby which she communicated to you. I am\r\nglad she did it in a Manner so acceptable. Indeed I never found Reason\r\nto doubt her Discretion. What you have written is very obliging &\r\nsatisfactory to me. I hope to have the Pleasure of seeing you next\r\nMonth. We will then, after our usual Manner, disclose each others\r\nHearts.\r\n\r\nYour Letter of the 31st Decr was not long ago deliverd to me by the\r\nCount Chartres. He appears to me to be an amiable & fine-spirited young\r\nNobleman. After a short stay here, he preceded with the Marqs de la\r\nFayette to the Southward.\r\n\r\nYou will recollect a Design which I mentiond to you respecting our\r\nFriend Mr L, & the Omission which, we were informd the Evening before I\r\nleft Boston, had happend thro Mistake. I early wrote to you & requested\r\nyour Influence to have it rectified. I have heard Nothing of it since.\r\nIn my Opinion the most essential Interest of the Town of Boston will be\r\nservd by it, & therefore I cannot look upon it as a Matter of\r\nIndifference. Not being acquainted with that Gentleman in the early\r\nTimes of our Contest, I had by some means conceivd an Opinion of him\r\nnot so favorable; but having had an Opportunity of critically observing\r\nhim in the late Convention at Cambridge, I am satisfied he is a\r\nVirtuous Citizen, and possessd of the genuine Principles of New\r\nEngland. That Mr Rivington, if this Letter should fall into his Hands,\r\nmay not pretend to be at a LOSS to know what is here meant, I will\r\ninform him that the genuine Principles of New England are Republican\r\nPrinciples which have been admired by some of the greatest Characters,\r\nwhom (if he is an Englishman) his Country can boast of. You & I, among\r\nothers, have had the Honor of being abusd by Rivingtons Press. A labord\r\nPerformance has lately crept out, called the Times. I have had a\r\ncursory reading of it. It appears to me so much like the Productions of\r\ncertain Geniuses who figurd in Mr Popes Time, that had the Author been\r\ncotemporary with them, a Page might have been added to the Dunciad, to\r\nimmortalize his Works. I will endeavor to get some Parts of it\r\ntranscribd & carry them to Boston. I am sure the reading it would serve\r\nto divert rather than to give you the least Pain. My due Regards to\r\nFriends.\r\n\r\nYour affectionate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS McKEAN.1\r\n\r\n[MS., Historical Society of Pennsylvania.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON Augt 29th 1781\r\n\r\nMY HONORD FRIEND\r\n\r\nI have not yet acknowledgd your obliging Letter of the 8th of July,\r\ndeliverd to me by Mr Davidson. Bodily Indisposition prevented my\r\nwriting, when he returnd. I fancy he settled his Affairs here to his\r\nown Satisfaction. He is much esteemd by those who were favord with his\r\nCompany, & I hope he met with Nothing disagreable to him during his\r\nshort Stay among us.\r\n\r\nColo John Laurens with our Friend Mr Pain arrivd here a few Days ago\r\nfrom France. He left the Town the Day after his Arrival. His Visit to\r\nme was so short that I could not converse with him so fully as I wishd.\r\nI hope he will be able to inform you of his complete Success in his\r\nNegociation. Will you be so kind as to give me such Intelligence as you\r\nmay receive from him or any other Person from Europe. I wish to know\r\nthe true State of our Affairs. Are we soon to have Peace? However\r\ndesireable this may be, we must not wish for it on any Terms but such\r\nas shall he honorable & safe to our Country. Let us not disgrace our\r\nselves by giving just Occasion for it to be said hereafter, that we\r\nfinishd this great Contest with an inglorious Accommodation. Things are\r\nwhisperd here which, if true, will cause much Discontent. The Citizens\r\nof this Part of America will say, and judge, my dear Sir, whether it\r\nwould not be just, that the fishing Banks are at least as important as\r\nTobacco yards, or Rice Swamps, or the flourishing Wheat Fields of\r\nPennsylvania. The Name only of Independence is not worth the Blood of a\r\nsingle Citizen. We have not been so long contending for Trifles.

I take it for granted that a very great\r\nMajority of the People in Each of the United States are determind to\r\nsupport this righteous & necessary War, till they shall obtain their\r\ngrand Object, an undisputed Sovereignty. This must hereafter be\r\nmaintaind, under God, by the Wisdom and Vigour of their own Councils &\r\ntheir own Strength-- Their Policy will lead them, if they mean to form any\r\nConnections with Europe, to make themselves respectable in the Eyes of\r\nthe Nations by holding up to them the Benefits of their Trade-- Trade must\r\nbe so free to all as to make it the Interest of Each to protect it till\r\nthey are able to protect it themselves--This, the United States must do by\r\na Navy. Till they shall have erected a powerful Navy, they will be\r\nlyable to Insults wch may injure & depreciate their Character as a\r\nSovereign & independent State; & while they may be incapable of\r\nresenting it themselves, no friendly power may venture or care to\r\nresent it on their Behalf. The U. S. must then build a Navy. They have\r\nor may have all the Materials in Plenty--But what will Ships of War avail\r\nthem without Seamen?

Genl Bay-lie earnestly wishes that Mr Edgar may be introducd to\r\nHead Quarters because he thinks from what he has to say it will appear\r\nthat if two Gentlemen who are now Prisoners in Canada whose Names he\r\nwill mention to you may be exchangd they will be able to make a full\r\nDiscovery to you, of the Plan of union which he says is actually\r\ncompleated between the Govr of Canada & the principal Leaders in\r\nVermont. One of these Gentlemen General Baylie tells me he has long\r\nbeen acquainted with & confides in. It is possible you may be already\r\nsufficiently acquainted with this Matter; & there may be a Scheme of\r\nPolicy on our Side which has not come to my Knowledge. In this\r\nUncertainty I hope I shall be excusd troubling you with this Letter.\r\n\r\nMr Edgar, according to his own Account was in the British Service on\r\nthe Lakes in 1774, afterwards was at Detroit as a private Trader, when\r\nhe renderd Services to Colo Clark as an Intelligencer, became suspected\r\nhe was sent a Prisoner to Montreal where he lay in Irons nine Months, &\r\nafter two years Imprisonment, he made an Escape.\r\n\r\nAfter congratulating you on the Divine Blessing afforded to the Allied\r\nforces under the Direction of his Excy Genl Washington, I am &c\r\n\r\nTHE TOWN OF BOSTON TO THE SELECTMEN OF OTHER TOWNS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Chamberlain Collection, Boston Public Library.]\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN\r\n\r\nThe Inhabitants of the Town of Boston legally assembled, have taken\r\ninto Consideration a Matter which they conceive all the other Maritime\r\nTowns in this & the Neighboring States are equally, and some of them\r\nmore nearly interested than they. It is the Subject of the Fishery, and\r\nthe great Importance of a Common Right therein being secured to the\r\nUnited States, whenever a Treaty of Peace shall be concluded. To\r\nflatter our selves with so happy a Prospect, so far as to neglect the\r\nnecessary Preparations for another vigorous Campaign, would indeed be\r\nunbecoming the Wisdom of Americans; and yet, so important has been the\r\nSuccess of the allied Arms, the last year, that it would seem to be\r\nMadness in the Extreme for Britain any longer to persist in her\r\nunrighteous Claims. But Wisdom has forsaken her Councils.\r\n\r\nWe ought to presume, that the supreme Representative of these States\r\nwill have an equal Regard in so momentuous a Crisis to the Rights of\r\neach Individual. We would not suggest the Contrary. But, may it not be\r\nsupposd, that Persons whose Situation is remote from the Fishery, and\r\nwho derive Advantages from it in its more distant Effects & not\r\ndirectly perceivable, are probably not so attentive to its unspeakeable\r\nImportance, as others who are immediately concernd, & depend upon it as\r\nthe only Source of their Commerce & even their Subsistence? If this\r\nshould be the Fact, Would not States so immediately interested in the\r\nFishery as ours, be justly criminated by the others, if we should\r\nneglect seasonably to lay before them our own Sense of the Necessity of\r\nan express Article in a Treaty of Peace for its Security? Should we not\r\nbe wanting to our selves in a most essential Point, & be chargeable by\r\nall Posterity, with sacrificing our and their invalueable Rights by\r\nunpardonable Carelessness? Such is the Sentiment of this Town. And\r\nthough we would be far from obtruding this or any Sentiment of ours\r\nupon others, we cannot but think our selves justifyable in candidly\r\nrecommending it to their serious Deliberation.\r\n\r\nThis Town have judgd it necessary to instruct their Representatives in\r\nthe General Court on the Subject. The instructions are inclosd. Many\r\nother and cogent Reasons might have been urgd, & will undoubtedly be\r\nmade Use of by you, if you shall think it proper to take the Matter\r\ninto your Consideration. Should we be so fortunate as to have your full\r\nConcurrence in Opinion with us, we assure our selves that we shall be\r\nequally fortunate in the Aid we shall receive from your Concurrent\r\nExertions.\r\n\r\nIn the Name & by Order of the Town of Boston1 in Meeting legally\r\nassembled December 14 1781.\r\n\r\n1 Signed, in the original as published, by William Cooper, Town Clerk.\r\nThis letter and the instructions of the town of December 11, 1781, were\r\nprinted in a pamphlet of three pages.

I duly acknowledgd the Receipt of your Favor\r\nwhich he brought me; but the LOSS of my Letter was attended with an\r\ninfinitely greater, that of Collo Palfrey. I wrote to you largely by\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe Son in Law of one of our good Friends has lately arrivd here from\r\nEngland, which gives great Disgust to more Persons than his near\r\nRelations conceive of. On his Arrival, the Governor & Council directed\r\nhim to state his Reasons for going to England and returning hither\r\nwithout the Leave of Government. He stated his Reasons; which in\r\ngeneral were to render Service to the United States, particularly by\r\nremoving the Ideas which the British Minister had conceivd of the\r\nAttachment of nine tenths of the Americans to that Government, and\r\ntheir Wishes to return to it. However frivolous this may appear to\r\nothers, his nearest Friends speak of it, can you believe me, in a high\r\nTone, and Mr ---- told me that Mr ------ was happy in being conscious not only of\r\nInnocence, but of great Merit.2--Those who hope for a Change of Person in\r\nour first Magistrate next Spring will be much embarrassd by this\r\nCircumstance.

In the same Conveyance is a Packett intended for\r\nyou from Congress, by which you will doubtless he informd of what has\r\nbeen doing there. It is six Months since I left Philadelphia; you\r\ncannot therefore expect I should give you any of the Intelligence of\r\nthat City. I presume Mr L1 makes known to you every thing interesting.\r\nI wrote to you frequently while I was there, but suppose all my Letters\r\nmiscarried, as well as yours if you have written to me; for I have not\r\nreceivd one for many Months. I except your favor by the Sieur de la\r\nEtombe, to whom I pay great Attention, both on Account of your\r\nRecommendation & his Merit. I give you Credit for a Packett of\r\nGazzettes lately receivd, because I knew the Direction on the Cover to\r\nbe your hand writing.\r\n\r\nMatters go on here just as you would expect from your knowledge of the\r\nPeople. Zealous in the great Cause, they hesitate at no Labor or\r\nExpence for its Support. Anxious to have a Code of Laws for the\r\ninternal Government, adapted to the Spirit of their new Constitution\r\nwith which they continue to be highly pleasd, the General Court have\r\nappointed the supreme Judges with Mr Bowdoin who is at present at\r\nperfect Leisure, to revise the Laws and report necessary or proper\r\nAmendments. The two great Vacancies in the offices of President &\r\nProfessor of Mathematicks &c in our University are filled with\r\nGentlemen of Learning & excellent Characters, the Revd Mr Willard of\r\nBeverly & the Revd Mr Williams. The Academy of Arts & Sciences is in a\r\nflourishing Way. A new Society is incorporated by the Name of the\r\nMedical Society. And this Metropolis has lately appointed a Committee,\r\nto consider the present Arrangement of the Schools & what further\r\nImprovements may be made, in which the better Education of female\r\nChildren is designd to be comprehended. All these things I know are\r\npleasing to you. Our People treat Foreigners of Merit who come among\r\nthem, with good Humour & Civility, being desirous of adopting the\r\nvirtuous Manners of others, and ingrafting them into our Stock.\r\nLaudable Examples on their side & ours will be productive of mutual\r\nBenefits. Indeed the Men of Influence must form the Manners of the\r\nPeople. They can operate more towards cultivating the Principles &\r\nfixing the Habits of Virtue than all the Force of Laws. This I think is\r\nverified in the Experience of the World; & should induce those People\r\nwho exercise the Right of electing their own Rulers, to be circumspect\r\nin making their Choice. You are well enough acquainted with the\r\nCharacter of our first Magistrate to judge what Effects his Influence\r\nwill have upon Manners.\r\n\r\nInclosd are some of the Proceedings of a late Town Meeting,2 which I\r\nsend to you as a private Citizen for your mere information. The Meeting\r\nwas called in Consequence of a Letter receivd by our Selectmen from\r\nMarblehead, in which it was proposd that the Subject should be\r\nconsiderd in a Convention of the Maritime Towns. But this Town judgd it\r\nmore proper to lay the Matter before the General Court, and have\r\naccordingly instructed their Representatives & recommended it to the\r\nothers to take the same Method. They could not think it becoming in\r\nthem to write to you (tho a fellow Citizen) on a Subject which concerns\r\nthe American Republick. They have an entire Confidence in your\r\nAttachment to the Interest of the United States & of this which makes\r\nan essential Part of it.\r\n\r\nThe Count de Noailles tells me he has a Letter for you from your\r\nFamily.

The Citizen & the Soldier are called to the Exercise of Self\r\nDenial and Patience, and to make the utmost Exertions in Support of the\r\ngreat Cause we are engagd in. Providence has highly honord our Patriots\r\n& Heroes in calling them into Existence at a Time when there is an\r\nObject worthy their Views. The Romans fought for Empire. The Pride of\r\nthat haughty People was to domineer over the rest of Mankind. But this\r\nis not our Object. We contend for the Liberty of our Country and the\r\nRights of human Nature. We hope to succeed in so righteous a Contest;\r\nand it is our Duty to acquire such Habits, and to cultivate in those\r\nwho are to come after us such Principles and Manners as will perpetuate\r\nto our Country the Blessings which are purchasd with our Toils and\r\nDangers.\r\n\r\nI have been expecting your Confidential Letters under the Signature you\r\nproposd. Pray let me hear of the Event of the Court Martial, and as\r\nmany particulars as are expedient--Complts to your Lady.\r\n\r\nAdieu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN LOWELL.\r\n\r\n[Historical Magazine, 1st ser., vol. i., pp. 260, 261.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON, May 15th, 1782.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,--\r\n\r\nThe General Court was prorogu'd Friday, the tenth instant, previous to\r\nwhich on the same day the Govr sent the Impost Bill to the house of\r\nRepresentatives with his objections and reasons against it stated in\r\nform. The house conceiving that the five days to which he was limited\r\nby the Constitution, had expired the preceding day, sent it back to him\r\nwithout reading the objections, as being in their opinion to all intent\r\nand purposes a law. It seems the bill had been sent to the Governor on\r\nSaturday. He excludes Sunday from the 5 days, in which the House differ\r\nin opinion. This matter of difference which arises from an incidental\r\ncircumstance, would have been avoided if his Excellency had thought it\r\nconvenient to have sent the bill to the House a day sooner. It is a\r\nsubject of speculation among the political casuists. But how will it\r\naffect the great public for whose benefit it was intended? If the bill\r\nhas become a law, how will it operate? What will be the opinion of\r\nCongress concerning it under its present circumstances? I wish to hear\r\nfrom you by return of this post.\r\n\r\nYesterday, this town made choice of the same gentlemen to represent\r\nthem in the G. C. who had served them the last year, except that Mr.\r\nLord1 is chosen in the room of Mr. Davis.2 No one doubts my personal\r\nregard for Mr. L., but I think it may be highly dangerous, and attended\r\nwith very ill effects, to admit an undue influence of the\r\nSuperintendent of Finance into the general assemblies of these states,\r\nand therefore could not help mentioning my objections, to such of the\r\ninhabitants as I had an opportunity of conversing with, against his\r\nagent's being chosen a member of ours. The post is just going.\r\n\r\nYour affectionate,\r\n\r\n1 The town records appear to indicate that John Rowe should have been\r\nnamed in this connection.\r\n\r\n2 Caleb Davis; cf. page 253.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN LOWELL.\r\n\r\n[Historical Magazine, 1st ser., vol. i., p. 261.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON, June 4th, 1782.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,--\r\n\r\nLast week the House of Representatives directed the attendance of the\r\nSecretary, and enquired of him whether he had forwarded the Impost Act\r\nto Congress. He answered he had not seen it since he left it on their\r\ntable, in the last session. The House then sent a message to the\r\nGovernor to the same purpose.\r\n\r\nHe returned a message acquainting them that he conceived the bill in\r\nthe same light he had before, and could not send it to Congress as a\r\nlaw, or to that effect; adding, that if the House would signify their\r\ndesire of having it, the Secretary would be directed to lay it before\r\nthem. The House stated the matter, and sent it to the Senate with the\r\nGovernor's message and a vote to join a committee to consider them, and\r\nthe Senate concurred; the result of which is that the two houses have\r\nresolved, that the Governor did not return the bill to the late House\r\nof Representatives, where it had originated, within five days after it\r\nwas presented to him by the late General Court, and therefore that it\r\nhad passed all the forms prescribed by the Constitution to constitute\r\nit a law of the Commonwealth. What the next step will be, may, I think,\r\nbe easily foreseen, that those who are against the law upon principle,\r\nor those who would wish to gratify the Govr, will move for a repeal of\r\nit, and have a new bill brought in. But it is difficult for me to\r\nconceive how a bill can be framed which will remove his doubts, and\r\nanswer the end of Congress. You remember that matter was once tried. I\r\nmust break off abruptly.\r\n\r\nYour affectionate,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ARTHUR LEE.\r\n\r\n[R. H. Lee, Life of Arthur Lee, vol. ii., pp. 229, 230.1]\r\n\r\nBOSTON, Nov. 21st, 1782.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,--In the late session of our general court, and in the hurry\r\nof important business, a petition was presented signed William Burgess,\r\npraying to be naturalized. This gentleman very lately arrived from\r\nEngland, by way of Holland. The senate declined sustaining his\r\npetition, and gave him leave to withdraw it. A few days after, an\r\nauthenticated resolution of congress came to hand, recommending it to\r\nthe states not to admit any British subject whatever. Yet this man has\r\nhad interest enough to prevail on the assembly to permit him to go to\r\ncongress, to have it decided there whether he comes within the meaning\r\nof their resolution, because his arrival here was prior to the\r\nreception of the resolution by this government. If it should be thought\r\nthere was in this instance a want of attention, it must be imputed to\r\nthe circumstance I first mentioned. The general court had before\r\ndirected his departure from the state; requesting the governor however,\r\nto allow him convenient time to prepare for his voyage, which appeared\r\nto me a sufficient indulgence. Some of our good citizens are disgusted\r\nat the favour shown to Mr. B. They say that being a partner with\r\nMessrs. Champion and Dickinson, the latter of whom is reported to have\r\nbeen always inimical to America by his residence here, he will probably\r\nbe instrumental in the importation of as many English goods as he will\r\nbe able to vend; or in other words, that the new house in Boston will\r\nbe nearly if not quite as convenient in the time of war, as the old\r\nhouse in London was in time of peace. Whether there will be any danger,\r\ncongress will judge. Jealousy is a necessary political virtue,\r\nespecially in times like these. Such a plan would gratify those among\r\nus who are still hankering after the onions of Egypt, and would\r\nsacrifice our great cause to the desire of gain. What need is there of\r\nour admitting (to use the language of congress) any British subject\r\nwhatever? Congress surely had some good reason when they so earnestly\r\ncautioned us against it. Our citizens are in more danger of being\r\nseduced by art, than subjugated by arms. I give you this notice that\r\nyou may have an opportunity of conversing on the subject in your\r\npatriotic circles (if you think it worth while) in season. Mr. B. will\r\nset off next week in company with one of our new delegates, who I am\r\nsatisfied will favour his cause. My friendly regards to Dr. Shippen,\r\nand my old friends in congress, if any such are there. Adieu.\r\n\r\nBelieve me to be very affectionately your friend,\r\n\r\n1 A short note to Lee, also dated November 21, is in Ibid., p. 231.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ARTHUR LEE.\r\n\r\n[R. H. Lee, Life of Arthur Lee, vol. ii., pp. 231, 232.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON, Dec 2d, 1782.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,--A friend of mine to whom I give entire credit, who lived\r\nmany years in Canada, and was well acquainted with the bearer of this\r\nletter, requests me to introduce him to you. After a long confinement\r\nin prison in Quebec, where he was used with great severity, he found\r\nmeans to make his escape, and came to this town. He is a Frenchman by\r\nbirth, and was a very respectable merchant in Canada. When the attempt\r\nwas made to gain that country in 1775, he privately aided our forces;\r\nthe suspicion of which rendered him obnoxious to the British\r\ngovernment, and was the real cause of his suffering. He will inform you\r\nof the state and circumstances of British affairs there, and will tell\r\nyou it is an easy thing to unite that province with these states.\r\nPossibly he may be influenced in some degree by a just resentment of\r\nthe ill-treatment he has received; but other intelligent persons\r\nacquainted with the people of Canada, have zealously affirmed the same\r\nto me. If it be so, it is hoped that a favourable opportunity to effect\r\nit will be embraced, if any such should offer. I need not hint to you\r\nthe importance of that object. Adieu,\r\n\r\nYour friend,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1783\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ARTHUR LEE.\r\n\r\n[R. H. Lee, Life of Arthur Lee, vol. ii., pp. 232-234, a draft is in\r\nthe Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON, Feb. 10th, 1783.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,--It is a long time since I had the pleasure of a letter from\r\nyou. I hope you have not struck my name from the list of your\r\ncorrespondents. Mr. Stephen Higginson, who will deliver you this\r\nletter, is appointed a delegate of this state. He is a sensible and\r\nvery worthy man, and I think entertains sentiments like yours. I am\r\npersuaded you will find him a valuable member, if his great modesty and\r\ndiffidence of himself will allow him to step forward as far as his good\r\nunderstanding would lead him.\r\n\r\nI feel myself constrained to mention to you the present situation of\r\nCapt. Landais, though not at his request, or the smallest intimation\r\nfrom him. He resides in this town, and sometimes calls to see me. As he\r\nappears to be an injured man, I wish that justice may be done to him;\r\nand I am the more solicitous about it, as I was, with your worthy\r\nbrother Mr. R. H. instrumental in his first appointment in the American\r\nnavy. Congress granted him 12,000 livres as a compensation for services\r\nhe had performed, and ordered that he should be paid by Dr. F. in\r\nFrance; but for some reason which is or ought to be known, he has never\r\nreceived that sum. Much the greater part of his wages as commander of\r\nthe Alliance remains unpaid. A large sum due to him for prize-money is\r\nstopped in the hands of some person or persons in France; which indeed\r\nis too common a complaint among those continental officers and seamen\r\nwho have carried prizes into ports in Europe. He made a journey to\r\nPhiladelphia to obtain a settlement of his accounts, and was offered by\r\nMr M.1 three months' pay, and a certificate for the balance, which he\r\nwould not accept, because he really wanted the whole of his wages to\r\nsupply him with the necessaries of life. I am sure that your own\r\nfeelings of justice and humanity will plead an excuse for my troubling\r\nyou with this detail. Perhaps his court-martial, by whose decree he was\r\nbroken, were too severe. If his conduct in his last passage from France\r\nwas blameable was not his mind to the greatest degree irritated by the\r\ntreatment he met with there? and should not reasonable allowances have\r\nbeen made? He thinks it was an unrighteous decree. He may judge\r\npartially; I know nothing of the matter. If it was, is not the wound\r\ngiven to his honour sufficiently severe? But even if it was just,\r\nshould not a discarded officer be immediately paid? Should not congress\r\ndemand the reason why the prize-money has not been paid to those to\r\nwhom it has been long due? Complaints of this kind have to my knowledge\r\nspread from Philadelphia to Boston. I am concerned for the honour of\r\ncongress. These complaints may appear of little consequence; but I am\r\nafraid if they continue unattended to, they will cast a dark shade over\r\nthe public character. The state of Landais' affairs will appear in his\r\nown memorial to congress, which was rejected, and perhaps may be on the\r\nfiles. You will oblige me if you will interest yourself (if leisure\r\nwill admit of it) as far as you may think just, in his favour.\r\n\r\nI have been applied to by some of the inhabitants of the island of\r\nNantucket, and have promised them to write to my friend respecting the\r\nwhale fishery. These people have been usually employed in that branch\r\nof business chiefly. They have greatly reduced the number of their\r\nvessels, since the commencement of the war, by which means they say\r\nthey are reduced to great distress and wish for some indulgence from\r\ncongress. Whether this can be consistently granted, and in what manner,\r\nyou will judge. The delegates of this state, I believe, can inform you\r\nmore particularly of this matter. You are sensible of the absolute\r\ndependence of this state upon the fishery for its trade, and how great\r\nan advantage will accrue from it to the United States, if they intend\r\never to have a navy. I hope our peacemakers are instructed by all means\r\nto secure a common right in it.\r\n\r\nMy respects to the Hon. Mr. Izard, if at Philadelphia, and other\r\nfriends. Adieu, and believe me very affectionately yours,\r\n\r\n1 Morns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SELECTMEN OF BOSTON.\r\n\r\n[MS., Chamberlain Collection, Boston Public Library.]\r\n\r\nMARCH 10 1783\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN\r\n\r\nHaving been just now made acquainted by your Messenger that the\r\nFreeholders and Inhabitants of Boston assembled in Town Meeting,1 have\r\nchosen me their Moderator, I beg the Favor of you to inform them, that\r\nI esteem my self greatly honourd by their Choice; but my Engagements in\r\nthe Senate, which it is not in my Power to dispense with, lay me under\r\na Necessity of praying that I may be excusd by the Town.----\r\n\r\nWith the warmest Wishes for their Prosperity, I am\r\n\r\nGentlemen\r\n\r\nYour obedient hbl Servt\r\n\r\n1 Boston Record Commissioners' Report, vol. xxvi., p. 292.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ARTHUR LEE.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON Apr 21 1783\r\n\r\nDR SR\r\n\r\nI am indebted to you for several Letters which I have not acknowledged.\r\nThe Anecdote you gave me in one of them relating to a Mr Mercer & Colo\r\nGriffin in Virginia was very diverting to me. The People in this part\r\nof the Continent would never have fixed upon the Names of La Le or A1\r\nto hold up to a publick Assembly as the Heads of a British Interest in\r\nAmerica. It would not have been sooner believed here than another Story\r\nI have heard, that a certain french Politician of Consideration in\r\nAmerica had expressd his high Displeasure with Mr S A for stiring up\r\nhis Countrymen to attend to the Importance of our retaining a Common\r\nRight to the Newfd Ld fishery. Many wonderful Tales are & will be told,\r\nsome of which a Sight of the secret Journals of Congress would unravel.\r\nI think the sooner those Journals are publishd the better. The People\r\nat large ought to know what that illustrious Body has been doing for\r\nthem and the Part each Member has acted. We are now at Peace, God be\r\nthanked, with all the World--and I hope we shall never intermeddle with\r\nthe Quarrels of other Nations. Let the U S continue in peace & Union, &\r\nin order to this Let them do Justice to each other. Let there be no\r\nlonger secret Journals or secret Comtees. Let the Debates in Congress\r\nbe open and the whole of their transactions publishd weekly--this will\r\ntend to the speedy rectifying Mistakes & preserving mutual Confidence\r\nbetween the People & their Representatives. And let Care be taken to\r\nprevent Factions in America, foreign or domestick.\r\n\r\nWill you suffer me to recommend to you my good friends & excellent\r\nfellow Citizens Mr Appleton the Bearer of this Letter & his fellow\r\nTraveller Mr Wendel.

This Gentleman soon\r\nafter the Commencement of the late Hostilities, left his Connections in\r\nNova Scotia which were respectable there & took a decided part with us\r\nagainst Great Britain. In the Winter of 77 Congress appointed him\r\nSuperintendent or Agent for the Indians in Nova Scotia & the Tribes to\r\nthe Northward & Eastward thereof, with a Salary of 900 Dollars p Annum,\r\n& afterwards requested this State to furnish him from time to time with\r\nneedful Supplies. The State raised an Artillery Company for the Defence\r\nof the Post of Machias & gave him the Command with a Cols Commission.\r\nCongress in Feb 81 if I mistake not, empowerd our supreme Executive to\r\nenlarge that Compy to the Number of 65, officers included, & to officer\r\nthe same with the express Nomination of Colo Allan to the Command. This\r\nCompy was by the Resolve to be raisd cloathed subsisted & paid as other\r\nofficers & Soldiers of the US. I believe Colo A has executed the trusts\r\nreposed in him with Fidelity & to the Advantage of the Publick. As this\r\nState has supplied him at the Expence of the U S, I suppose that his\r\nAccots which remain to be settled, will as his former Accts have been,\r\nbe settled in the first Instance by our Assembly when it meets. He\r\ntakes the Oppty in the Interval (the War being finishd) to wait on\r\nCongress for their further Direction. Your Notice of him & Care that he\r\nmay receive such Emoluments as he may be intitled to as an officer will\r\noblige me. I think he has too much Republican Pride to expect more than\r\nis reasonable from Congress, & he is too much the Gentleman to be\r\ntroublesome to you. I write this without his knowledge.\r\n\r\nAnother calls upon me. You will think me a Man of Importance! But this\r\nis one of my Days of Business. Is it not strange that an officer of the\r\nAmerican Army should apply to the Friendship of one whom they have been\r\nled to look upon as their Enemy? But--I am informd that Colo Badlam was\r\namong the first who flew to Arms, that he has sustained the Character\r\nof a meritorious officer. If he has been unfortunate rather than faulty\r\nor if guilty of a Fault it was attended with Circumstances very\r\nalleviating why should an officer of Merit at the very close of the War\r\nbe deprivd of the Benefits which are allotted to others? I think I know\r\nyour feelings for that officer and perhaps your private Judgment of his\r\nCase from your Letter to him which I have seen. What Advantage can he\r\nexpect from an Application to this State? Would not a Recommendation to\r\nCongress from Head Quarters in his favor answer a much better Purpose?\r\nThis is only a Hint to you. Perhaps I am out of my Line. I will\r\nconclude this Epistle with congratulating you most heartily on the\r\nreturn of Peace with Liberty and Independence & assuring you that I am\r\naffectionately\r\n\r\nYours\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HORATIO GATES.\r\n\r\n[MS., Emmet Collection, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON May 2 1783\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nOur Friend Colo John Allan takes the Care of this Letter and will\r\ndeliver it to you. The War being finishd, he is going to Philadelphia\r\nto receive such Directions as Congress shall think proper to give to\r\nhim. You remember he was appointed in 77, Agent of the St Johns & Nova\r\nScotia Indians, and he has since commanded an Artillery Company raised\r\nby this State for the Defence of the Post at Machias, adopted by\r\nCongress in Feb. 81 and cloathd subsisted & paid as other Officers &\r\nSoldiers of the United States. He has I doubt not, executed the Trusts\r\nreposed in him with Fidelity, and I think is entitled to the Emoluments\r\ngiven to Officers of his Rank. I have given him a Letter to the\r\nSecretary at War &c.\r\n\r\nYour Recommendation first gaind him the Confidence of Congress and your\r\nrepeated Favor will still be a substantial Advantage to him.\r\n\r\nI most heartily congratulate you on the Return of Peace with Liberty &\r\nIndependence.--Blessings for which Patriots have toiled & Heroes fought &\r\nbled. Our Country may now be happy if she is not wanting to her self.\r\nWe have done our Duty. Future Generations can never curse the present\r\nfor carelessly surrendering their Rights.\r\n\r\nI beg you, my Friend, not to impute my long Silence to a faulty Cause.\r\nIf you believe me to be a Man of Truth, be assured that I have\r\nconstantly participated with you in good & ill Fortune.

T. Austin, Life of Elbridge Gerry, vol. i., pp. 408-410; a draft is\r\nin the Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON, Sept. 9, 1783.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nThis is the first letter I have been able to write since I had the\r\npleasure of seeing you, excepting a short one to our delegates,\r\ninforming them that the general court had appointed a committee to\r\ncorrespond with them. Mr. Appleton and Mr. Rowe are my colleagues in\r\nthis business. The correspondence is to be very extensive. \"Any other\r\nimportant matter which relates to the being and welfare of the United\r\nStates!\" My bodily illness has prevented my engaging in it. I wish the\r\ndelegates would begin. The welfare, and perhaps the being of the United\r\nStates, in my opinion, depends much upon congress possessing the\r\nconfidence of the people at large; that upon the administration of\r\npublic affairs being manifestly grounded upon principles of equality\r\nand justice, or upon the people being assured that congress merit their\r\nconfidence. The war is now over, and the people turn their eyes to the\r\ndisposition of their money, a subject, which I hope congress will\r\nalways have so clear a knowledge of, as to be able at any time to\r\nsatisfy the rational enquiries of the people. To prevent groundless\r\njealousies, it seems necessary not only that the principal in that\r\ndepartment should himself be immaculate, but that care should be taken\r\nthat no persons be admitted to his confidence but such as have the\r\nentire confidence of the people. Should a suspicion prevail that our\r\nhigh treasurer suffers men of bad principles or of no principles to be\r\nabout him and employed by him, the fidelity of congress itself would be\r\nsuspected, and a total loss of confidence would follow. I am much\r\nconcerned for the reputation of congress, and have laboured to support\r\nit because that body is and must be the cement of the union of the\r\nstates. I hope, therefore, they will always make it evident to\r\nreasonable men that their administration merits the public applause.\r\nWill they be able to do this, if they should cease to be very watchful\r\nover men whom they trust in great departments, especially those who\r\nhave the disposition of the public moneys? Power will follow the\r\npossession of money, even when it is known that it is not the\r\npossessor's property. So fascinating are riches in the eyes of mankind!\r\nWere our financier, I was going to say, even an angel from heaven, I\r\nhope he will never have so much influence as to gain the ascendency\r\nover congress, which the first lord of the treasury has long had over\r\nthe parliament of Britain; long enough to effect the ruin of that\r\nnation. These are the fears which I expressed in congress when the\r\ndepartment was first instituted. I was told, that the breath of\r\ncongress could annihilate the financier; but I replied, that the time\r\nmight come, and if they were not careful it certainly would, when even\r\ncongress would not dare to blow that breath. Whether these fears are\r\nthe mere creatures of the imagination you will judge.\r\n\r\nMy regards to Dr. Holten and Mr. Higgenson, if he is still in Congress.\r\nPray write to me often.\r\n\r\nAdieu.\r\n\r\n1 For a facsimile note by Adams to Gerry, dated September 11, 1783, see\r\nBrotherhead, Signers of the Declaration of Independence (1872), p. 172.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Adams Papers, Quincy; the text is also in John Adams, Works, vol.\r\nix., pp. 519-521.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON Novr 4 1783.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nColo John Trumbull, the Son of the worthy Governor of Connecticutt is\r\nthe Bearer of this Letter. I give the Governor this Epithet, because I\r\nthink his faithful Services to our Country entitle him to it. Yet even\r\nhe has undergone the Suspicions of some, unsupported by any solid\r\nReasons that I have heard of. We live in an Age of Jealousy, and it is\r\nwell enough. I was led to believe in early Life, that Jealousy is a\r\npolitical Virtue. It has long been an Aphorism with me, that it is one\r\nof the greatest Securities of publick Liberty. Let the People keep a\r\nwatchful Eye over the Conduct of their Rulers; for we are told that\r\nGreat Men are not at all times wise. It would be indeed a Wonder if in\r\nany Age or Country they were always honest. There are however some Men\r\namong us, who under the Guise of watchful Patriots, are finding Fault\r\nwith every publick Measure, with a Design to destroy that just\r\nConfidence in Government, which is necessary for the Support of those\r\nLiberties which we have so dearly purchas'd. Many of your Countrymen\r\nbesides myself, feel very grateful to you and those of our Negociators\r\nwho joyned you, in preventing the Tory Refugees from being obtruded\r\nupon us. These would certainly have increasd the Number of such Kind of\r\nPatriots as I have mentiond, and besides, their Return would have been\r\nattended with other mischievous Effects. Mutual Hatred and Revenge\r\nwould have occasiond perpetual Quarrels between them & the people &\r\nperhaps frequent Bloodshed. Some of them, by Art and Address might\r\ngradually recover a Character & in time an Influence, and so become the\r\nfittest Instruments in forming Factions either for one foreign Nation\r\nor another. We may be in Danger of such Factions, and should prudently\r\nexpect them. One might venture to predict that they will sooner or\r\nlater happen. We should therefore guard against the evil Effects of\r\nthem. I deprecate the most favord Nation predominating in the Councils\r\nof America, for I do not believe there is a Nation on Earth that wishes\r\nwe should be more free or more powerful than is consistent with their\r\nIdeas of their own Interest. Such a disinterested Spirit is not to be\r\nfound in National Bodies; The World would be more happy if it prevaild\r\nmore in individual Persons. I will say it for my Countrymen, they are,\r\nor seem to be, very grateful. All are ready freely to acknowledge our\r\nObligations to France for the Part she took in our late Contest. There\r\nare a few who consider the Advantage derivd to her, by a total\r\nSeperation of Britain & the Colonies, which so sagacious a Court\r\ndoubtless foresaw & probably never lost Sight of. This Advantage was so\r\nglaring in the first Stages of our Controversy, that those who then ran\r\nthe Risque of exciting even an Appeal to Heaven rather than a\r\nSubmission to British tyranny, were well perswaded that the Prospect of\r\nsuch a Seperation would induce France to interpose, and do more than\r\nshe has done if necessary. America with the Assistance of her faithful\r\nAlly has secured and establishd her Liberty & Independence. God be\r\npraisd! And some would think it too bold to assert, that France has\r\nthereby saved the Being of her great Importance.--But if it be true why\r\nmay we not assert it? A punctual Fulfillment of Engagements solemnly\r\nenterd into by Treaty is the Justice, the Honor & Policy of Nations. If\r\nwe, who have contracted Debts, were influenced only by Motives of sound\r\nPolicy, we should pay them as soon as possible & provide sure &\r\nadequate Funds for the Payment of Interest in the mean time. When we\r\nhave done this we shall have the Sense of Independence impressd on our\r\nMinds, no longer feeling that State of Inferiority which a wise King\r\ntells us the Borrower stands in to the Lender.\r\n\r\nYour Negociation with Holland, as \"my old Friend\" observd, is all your\r\nown. The faithful Historian will do Justice to your Merits--Perhaps not\r\ntill you are dead. I would have you reconcile yourself to this Thought.\r\nWhile you live you will probably be the Object of Envy. The leading\r\nCharacters in this great Revolution will not be fairly marked in the\r\npresent Age, It will be well if the leading Principles are rememberd\r\nlong. You, I am sure, have not the Vanity, which Cicero betrayed, when\r\nhe even urged his Friend Licinius to publish the History of the\r\nDetection of Cataline in his Life Time that he might enjoy it. I am far\r\nfrom thinking that Part of History redounds so much to the Honor of the\r\nRoman Consul, as the Treaty of Holland does to its American Negociator.\r\n\r\nDecr 4th I intended to have committed the Care of the foregoing Letter\r\nto Mr Trumbull, but when he called on me I was confind to my Chamber by\r\nsevere bodily Indisposition unable to attend even to the lightest\r\nBusiness. I am still kept at home, but hope soon to be abroad. Mr Jonn\r\nJackson will deliver this to you if he meets you in London, otherwise\r\nhe will convey it by some safe hand. When I shall be certain of your\r\nbeing appointed for London, I will write to you as often as I can. May\r\nHeaven bless you My Friend as I am\r\n\r\naffectionately yours\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1784\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Adams Papers, Quincy.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON Feb 4 1784\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR/\r\n\r\nI had laid up in my mind many things to say to you, but an hours notice\r\nonly of this opportunity and the hurry of business in the General Court\r\nnow sitting prevents my communicating them to you at present. The Son\r\nof Mr Nathl Appleton will deliver to you this short epistle; written\r\nfor the sake of recommending him to your notice. He is a young\r\ngentleman lately enterd into Business in the Commercial line. My\r\nAffection for a young fellow Citizen, and Regard for his Father an\r\nintimate friend & a Member of the old committee of Correspondence of\r\nthis town are strong Inducements to me to take this method of availing\r\nthe Son of your Advice & Patronage. I wrote to you the 4 Decr by Mr\r\nJonathan Jackson & will write again by the next opportunity. Your\r\nFamily was well a few Days ago. You will doubtless have heard, before\r\nthis will reach you, of the Death of our good Friend Dr Cooper.\r\n\r\nAdieu\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ELBRIDGE GERRY.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON Feb 25 1784\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nWhen a Committee was appointed by the G C1 to correspond with the\r\nDelegates in Congress for this C W2 I proposd that the Correspondence\r\nshd be carried on in a liberal Manner; but it was apprehended that the\r\nSentiments of the G C might be mistaken by the Come & the Delegates\r\nthereby misled & so the Idea was drop'd & nothing material was left for\r\nthe Court to do but to forward such Letters or papers as shd be from\r\ntime to time orderd by the Court. Had the Come pursued the first\r\nproposal, I could have had no Share in the Correspondence having been\r\nexceedingly sick the greatest part of the Time from June to January.\r\nThis I hope will apologize for my not having written to you & my other\r\nFriends in Congress; which I mention because, not receiving your\r\nfavors, I have been affraid you imputed my Omission to Neglect. In the\r\nSeptember Session the Court thought fit to direct the Delegates\r\nofficially to write to the Govr once a fortnight which of Course\r\ndissolved the Corresponding Come, & since that time no Letters from the\r\nDelegates have been laid before the G C.\r\n\r\nYour Letter of Sept 11 directed to the Come was through mere\r\nforgetfulness omitted to be communicated in Season. This was attributed\r\nby some Persons of illiberal Minds & Party Spirit to an abominable\r\nDesign to withhold from the Court the Sentiments of the Delegates\r\nrespecting the Expediency of refusing to yield Supplys to the\r\nContinental Treasury till Justice should be done us with Regard to the\r\nOld money now in our publick Treasury & private hands. I could not help\r\ndiverting my self with the Ebullitions of apparent Zeal for the publick\r\nGood on this Occasion, and upon its being said by a Gentn in Senate\r\nthat it was the Subject of warm Conversation among the people without\r\nDoors I observed the Clamour wd undoubtedly subside on the Afternoon of\r\nthe first Monday in April next. Your Letter has since been very\r\nprudently published by an unknown Person in Edes' Paper.\r\n\r\nInclosd is a Letter to your Self from Colo Scar Gridley. It seems he\r\napplied to this G C some time ago for Depretion of his pay while in the\r\nService, upon which the Govr was requested to write to G W to make\r\nknown to him the Rank held by Mr Gridley & . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\r\n. . . . . . . . . . .but the Letter has never been written. I advisd\r\nhim to write you on the Subject, & hope you will excuse my giving you\r\nthe Trouble. As you are now near the Place of Residence of General\r\nWashington, perhaps it may not be inconvenient to you to write to him,\r\nin doing which you will gratify & oblige Mr Gridley.\r\n\r\nI shall esteem a Letter from you one of the greatest favors being your\r\nvery affectionate Friend,\r\n\r\n1 General Court.\r\n\r\n2 Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Adams Papers, Quincy; a draft is in the Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON April 16 1784\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nI have not receivd a Letter from you of a later Date than the 10th of\r\nSeptr last. Extracts of yours to D G of the same Date have been handed\r\nabout, with a View, as I conceivd, of giving the Sanction of your\r\nOpinion to that of others respecting the Tories. It is often\r\ninconvenient, perhaps unsafe, to trust ones Confidential Letters to\r\nindiscrete, however honest, Friends. Detachd Parts of them being given\r\nout, they may be made to bear a different Construction from what was\r\nintended, and answer the Purpose of interrested & designing Men. When\r\nthe Recommendations of Congress in Pursuance of the 5th Article of the\r\nTreaty were receivd here, they were treated with great Decency & very\r\nseriously considerd. They were construed differently by Men of Sense,\r\nwho were above the Influence of old Prejudices or of Party or Family\r\nConnections. This Difference, I supposed, was owing to certain\r\nAmbiguities in the Treaty, which I afterwards found had been\r\nacknowledgd in a joynt Letter to Congress of the 18th July, in which it\r\nappeard that our Negociators had studiously avoided any Expressions in\r\nthe Articles of the Treaty which shd amount to absolute Stipulations in\r\nFavor of the Tories. From the first Sight I had of the Articles, I have\r\nbeen of opinion that no such Construction could fairly be put upon\r\nthem, but that it would finally lie with the several Legislatures of\r\nthe States, how far it would be proper to show Lenity to them, and I\r\nwas happy in being confirmd in this Opinion by an Expression in your\r\njoynt Letter to Congress Septr 10th--\"it is much to be wishd that the\r\nLegislators may not involve all the Tories in Banishment and Ruin, but\r\nthat such Discrimination may be made as to intitle the Decisions to the\r\nApprobation of disinterested Men and dispassionate Posterity.\" In this\r\nView I early inculcated Moderation and Liberality towards them, as far\r\nas could be consistent with that leading Principle of Nature which\r\nought to govern Nations as it does Individuals, Self Preservation. I\r\ncannot think that all can be admitted consistently with the Safety of\r\nthe Commonwealth. I gave you my Reasons in my Letter of Nov. 4th. Nor\r\ncan I believe you intended to be understood universally in your private\r\nLetter above referrd to. Some of them would be useful & good Citizens;\r\nothers, I believe highly dangerous. Our Act passed in the late Session\r\nof the General Court declares them all Aliens, and excludes those of\r\nthem who in a former Act were called Conspirators from residing among\r\nus. It restores the Estates of others which have not been confiscated\r\nand refers their coming to reside within the Commonwealth in the first\r\nInstance to the Governor with Advice of Council. The Licenses he may\r\ngive are to be valid if approvd of by the General Court at the Session\r\nnext after such License shall be given. It is thought that this will be\r\na difficult Task for the Governor & Council, but a constant Attention\r\nto the publick Safety without Respect to Persons will prevent\r\nDifficulties. \"Much, says your joynt Letter, will depend upon our\r\nNegociations with England.\" The sooner a Commercial Treaty is settled\r\nwith that Nation the better, as it appears to me. Our General Court, in\r\nthe late Session, thought of making Retaliation on England for her\r\nprohibiting Importations from America into her West India Islands but\r\nin British Bottoms. They were sensible of the Difficulty in the Way of\r\nthe United States coming into general Regulations of this Kind, & have\r\nwritten to their Delegates on the Subject. Should the States agree to\r\ngive Congress a more extensive Power, it may yet be a great while\r\nbefore it is compleated; and Britain in the mean time seeing our Trade\r\ndaily reverting to its old Channel, may think it needless and\r\nimpolitick to enter into express Stipulations in favor of any Part of\r\nit while she promises her self the whole without them.\r\n\r\nI am fully in the Sentiment expressd in your joynt Letter Sept 10th,\r\nthat now we have regular & constitutional Governments, popular\r\nCommittees and County Conventions are not only useless but dangerous.\r\nThey served an excellent Purpose & were highly necessary when they were\r\nset up. I shall not repent the small Share I then took in them. But\r\nwhat think you of the District & State Conventions of the Cincinnati, &\r\nof the Cincinnati in Congress assembled? Do not these Assemblies\r\nconvene expressly to deliberate & adopt Measures on great and National\r\nConcerns proper only for the Cognizance of the United States in\r\nCongress assembled, and the different Legislators & Officers of\r\nGovernment? And will they not, being an Order of Military Men, too soon\r\nproceed to enforce their Resolutions, not only to the lessening the\r\nDignity of the States in the Eye of Europe, but the putting an End to\r\ntheir free Existence! The Order is very unpopular here. By the inclosd\r\nyou will see the Sentiments of our Genl Court. The Governor of Sdeg.\r\nCarolina in a late Speech to his Assembly inveighs against them with\r\nthe Vehemence of Luther.\r\n\r\nAdieu\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Adams Papers, Quincy; a draft is in the Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON April 17 1784\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR\r\n\r\nSeveral of my Fellow Citizens have desired me to mention to you certain\r\nDifficulties they labour under & to request that you would inform me\r\nwhether it is probable they can obtain Reliefe, among whom are Dr Nath1\r\nNoyes & Capt Saml Dashwood. Both of them I believe you knew. I inclose\r\nMr Noyess Questions as he has stated them himself.--Capt Dashwoods Goods\r\nwere taken from him by order of the Commanding officer of the British\r\nTroops when they left this Town in 1776. I need not trouble you to\r\nexplain as I doubt not you well remember the Circumstances of these\r\nMatters. It will be hard for such Persons to pay the British Creditors\r\nfor the same Goods which the British Nation took from them for its own\r\nnecessary Use & if I mistake not with a Promise to compensate them,\r\nunless the Promise is complied with.\r\n\r\nA few Lines on this Subject when you are at Leisure will very much\r\noblige them as well as\r\n\r\nYour Friend\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ELBRIDGE GERRY.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library; a text is in J. T. Austin,\r\nLife of Elbridge Gerry, vol. i., pp. 422-424.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON April 19th 1784\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nMr Higginson was so obliging as to show me your Letter to him dated the\r\n4th of March. I was happy in having adopted an opinion of the\r\nCincinnati so similar to what I found yours to be. I think I am as\r\nsensible as any Man ought to be of the important Services of our late\r\nArmy, and am very desirous that their full Share of Merit may be\r\ngratefully acknowledgd & rewarded by the Country. This would have been\r\ndone, (for the Prejudice of the People against the Gratuity of five\r\nyears pay began to subside) had they not adopted a Plan so disgustfull\r\nto the Common Feeling. It appears wonderful that they could imagine a\r\nPeople who had freely spent their Blood & Treasure in Support of their\r\nequal rights & Liberties, could so soon be reconciled to the odious\r\nhereditary Distinction of Families. This Country must be humiliated &\r\ndebased to a great Degree, before they will patiently bear to see\r\nIndividuals stalking with their assumed honorary Badges, & proudly\r\nboasting \"These are the Distinctions of our Blood.\" I cannot think that\r\nmany of our Officers entertained such an Idea of haughty Pre-eminence;\r\nbut the human Mind is so captivated with the Thought of being elevated\r\nabove the ignoble Vulgar, that their Sons, if they should not\r\nthemselves, when they perceive the Multitude grown giddy with gazing,\r\nmay assume more than the mere Pageantry of Nobility. When Men begin to\r\napplaud themselves, they are not easily perswaded to believe they can\r\ntake a greater Share of Honor than justly belongs to them. They will be\r\npleasd with the Adulatory Addresses of other Men & flatter themselves\r\nthat they are intitled to Power and Authority as well as the\r\nostentatious Show of Superiority above their Equals. I confess I do not\r\nbarely dislike the order. With you I think it dangerous & look upon it\r\nwith the Eye of Jealousy. When the Pride of Family possesses the Minds\r\nof Men it is threatning to the Community in Proportion to the Good they\r\nhave done. The unsuspecting People, when they are in a Mood to be\r\ngrateful, will cry up the Virtues of their Benefactors & be ready to\r\nsay, Surely those Men who have done such great things for us, will\r\nnever think of setting up a Tyranny over us. Even Patriots & Heroes may\r\nbecome different Men when new & different Prospects shall have alterd\r\ntheir Feelings & Views; and the undiscerning People may too late repent\r\nthat they have sufferd them to exalt themselves & their Family upon the\r\nRuins of the Common Liberty. The Cincinnati are very unpopular here;\r\nyou will wonder then that one of the Order has had a Majority of the\r\nVotes of this Town for a Senator for the County. I am affraid the\r\nCitizens are not so vigilant as they used and ought still to be. It was\r\ngiven out at the Moment of Election that he intended to withdraw\r\nhimself from the Society. If he does, it may weaken their Influence--if\r\nnot, he will probably destroy his own. You have doubtless seen the\r\nSentiments of the General Court of the Order. The Reprobating Speech of\r\nthe Governor of So Carolina has been publishd in our papers.\r\n\r\nI had the Pleasure of receiving by the same Post your several Letters\r\nof the 15th, 20th and 24th Ulto. If I have a Seat in the General Court\r\nthe ensuing year, (which is uncertain) I shall (tho very reluctantly)\r\ncommunicate your Intention to leave Congress, unless you will gratify\r\nthe earnest Wishes of your Friends by altering your Determination. I\r\nassure you there is no Friend to our Country within my Circle who is\r\nnot anxiously solicitous for your continuing there longer. I was in\r\nhopes when you was prevailed upon again to take a Seat you would have\r\nheld it at least two years. Let me entreat you to release me from the\r\nobligation of complying with your Request.\r\n\r\nI have written so much in Spite of my trembling hand, concerning the\r\nCini, that I can at present only fulfill a Promise I gave our Navy\r\nofficers, to inclose their Petition to Congress and to beg your\r\nPatronage of it. They appear to me to be injurd or at least neglected\r\nMen. It is certainly high time they should receive their Prize Money\r\nand Assurances of their Pay. I will write you by Mr Lowell (who sets\r\noff for Phila in a few Days & intends making you a Visit) or by the\r\nPost speedily. Mrs A desires her Complts\r\n\r\nAdieu my Friend,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ELBRIDGE GERRY.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library; a text with modifications is\r\nin J. T. Austin, Life of Elbridge Gerry, vol. i., pp. 424-427.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON April 23 1784\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nMr Lowel thinks he shall not be able to make you a Visit at Annapolis\r\nas he intended, so I have not written by him. Is the Court of Appeals1\r\nof which he is a Member to continue now the War is over? I should think\r\nit a needless Expence. If ever there should be Occasion for it, a new\r\nCourt might at any time be constituted. I observe by the inclosd, that\r\nthe Cincinnati in Congress assembled are to meet at Philadelphia on the\r\n5th of May & that General Washington is to preside. That Gentleman has\r\nan idea of the Nature & Tendency of the Order very different from mine,\r\notherwise I am certain he would never have given it his Sanction. I\r\nlook upon it to be as rapid a Stride towards an hereditary Military\r\nNobility as was ever made in so short a Time. My Fears may be ill\r\ngrounded, but if they are not, it is impossible for me not to think it\r\na very great Misfortune to these States that he is a Member; for the\r\nReputation he has justly acquired by his Conduct while Commander in\r\nChiefe of our Armies, and the Gratitude & warm Affection which his\r\nCountrymen do & ought to feel towards him will give Weight to any thing\r\nhe patronizes, & Lustre to all who may be connected with him. It is a\r\nTribute due to the Man who has servd his Country well, to esteem him\r\nhighly & confide in him. We ought not however to think any Man\r\nincapable of Error. But so it is with the Bulk of Mankind & even in a\r\nfree Country. They will reprobate the Idea of implicit Faith; and at\r\nthe same time, while the Impression of Gratitude is deep in their\r\nMinds, they will not admit of a Benefactor, which must be said of every\r\nMan, \"aliquando dormitat.\" I would never inculcate a mean & envious\r\nSuspicion of any Man especially of those who have renderd signal\r\nServices to their Country. But there is a Degree of Watchfulness over\r\nall Men possessd of Power or Influence upon which the Liberties of\r\nMankind much depend. It is necessary to guard against the Infirmities\r\nof the best as well as the Wickedness of the worst of Men. Such is the\r\nWeakness of human Nature that Tyranny has oftener sprang from that than\r\nany other Source. It is this that unravels the Mystery of Millions\r\nbeing enslavd by a few. What was it that indued the Cincinnati\r\nGentlemen who have undertaken to deliberate and act upon Matters which\r\nmay essentially concern \"the Happiness & future Dignity of the American\r\nEmpire,\" to admit foreign Military Subjects into their Society? Was\r\nthere not Danger before that a foreign Influence might prevail in\r\nAmerica? Do not Foreigners wish to have Weight in our Councils? Can\r\nsuch a Junction of Subjects of different Nations (& those Nations\r\nwidely different in their principles of Government) to Deliberate upon\r\nthings which relate to the Union & national Honor, the Happiness &\r\nfuture Dignity of one consist with sound Policy? Are we sure that those\r\nforeign Nations will never have separate Views & very national &\r\ninterrested ones too, because they once united in the same object & it\r\nwas accidentally their mutual Interest to fight Side by Side? If the\r\nCincinnati had a Right to erect themselves into an order for the\r\nnational Purposes of their Institution, had they a Right to call in\r\nforeign Aid for those Purposes? It appears to me as impolitic,\r\npreposterous & dangerous as it would be for the United States to invite\r\n& admit a Delegation from that foreign Power into their Congress.\r\n\r\nI take Notice that the Committee of Congress propose that the Govts of\r\nthe ten new States to be formd shall be in Republican form & shall\r\nadmit no Person to be a Citizen who holds any hereditary Title. I hope\r\nCongress will not fail to make this an indispensible Condition.\r\n\r\nYour Letter of the 2d relating to Colo Gridleys Affair came to hand. I\r\nam obligd to you for the Care you have taken.\r\n\r\nBelieve me to be yr sincere & affectionate Friend,\r\n\r\n1 Cf. J. F.

For this\r\nReason I afterwards thought an Answer would be of no Importance.\r\nDecency alone should, however, have induced me to have acknowledgd the\r\nFavor. I hope you will excuse the Omission.\r\n\r\nSome time in the Month of September last, a Gentleman in Connecticutt\r\nrequested me to give him my Opinion of a Subject, perhaps too much\r\naltercated in that State as well as this, The Commutation of half Pay\r\ngranted by Congress to the Officers of the late Army for Life for full\r\nPay during the Term of five years. I did not hesitate to say in Return,\r\nthat in my Opinion Congress was, in the Nature of their Appointment,\r\nthe sole Judge of the necessary Means of supporting the late Army\r\nraised for the Defence of our Common Rights against the Invasions of\r\nGreat Britain; and if, upon their own deliberate Councils & the\r\nrepeated Representations of the Commander in Chiefe of the Army, they\r\njudgd that the Grant of half Pay for Life was a Measure absolutely\r\nnecessary for the Support of a disciplined Army for the Purpose before\r\nmentiond, they had an undoubted Right to make it; and as it was made in\r\nbehalf of the United States by their Representative authorizd to do it,\r\neach State was bound in Justice & Honor to comply with it, even tho it\r\nshould seem to any to have been an ill judgd Measure; because States &\r\nIndividual Persons are equally bound to fulfill their Obligations, and\r\nit is given as Characteristick of an honest Man, that \"though he\r\nsweareth (or promiseth) to his own hurt he changeth not.\" I moreover\r\nacquainted him, that although I was never pleasd with the Idea of half\r\nPay for Life, for Reasons which appeard satisfactory to myself, some of\r\nwhich I freely explaind to him, yet I had always thought, that as the\r\nOpportunities of the Officers of the Army of acquiring moderate\r\nFortunes or making such Provision for their Families as Men generally\r\nwish to make, were not equal to those of their Fellow Citizens at home,\r\nit would be but just & reasonable, that an adequate Compensation should\r\nbe made to them at, or as soon as conveniently might be after, the End\r\nof the War; and that he might therefore conclude, that the Commutation,\r\nif it be an adequate Compensation had fully coincided with my Ideas of\r\nJustice & Policy.\r\n\r\nNothing was mentiond in his Letter to me, of the Nature or the\r\nProceedings of County Conventions, & therefore I made no Observation\r\nupon them. I hope it will not be in the Power of any designing Men, by\r\nimposing upon credulous tho' well meaning Persons long to keep this\r\nCountry, who may be happy if they will, long in a State of Discord &\r\nAnimosity. We may see, from the present State of Great Britain, how\r\nrapidly such a Spirit will drive a Nation to destruction. It is prudent\r\nfor the People to keep a watchful Eye over the Conduct of all those who\r\nare entrusted with Publick Affairs. Such Attention is the Peoples great\r\nSecurity.1 But there is Decency & Respect due to Constitutional\r\nAuthority, and those Men, who under any Pretence or by any Means\r\nwhatever, would lessen the Weight of Government lawfully exercised,\r\nmust be Enemies to our happy Revolution & the Common Liberty. County\r\nConventions & popular Committees servd an excellent Purpose when they\r\nwere first in Practice. No one therefore needs to regret the Share he\r\nmay then have had in them. But I candidly own it is my Opinion, with\r\nDeferrence to the Opinions of other Men, that as we now have\r\nconstitutional & regular Governments and all our Men in Authority\r\ndepend upon the annual & free Elections of the People, we are safe\r\nwithout them. To say the least, they are become useless. Bodies of Men,\r\nunder any Denomination whatever, who convene themselves for the Purpose\r\nof deliberating upon & adopting Measures which are cognizable by\r\nLegislatures only will, if continued, bring Legislatures to Contempt &\r\nDissolution. If the publick Affairs are illy conducted, if dishonest or\r\nincapable Men have crept unawares into Government, it is happy for us,\r\nthat under our American Constitutions the Remedy is at hand, & in the\r\nPower of the great Body of the People. Due Circumspection & Wisdom at\r\nthe next Elections will set all right, without the Aid of any self\r\nCreated Conventions or Societies of Men whatever.2 While we retain\r\nthose simple Democracies in all our Towns which are the Basis of our\r\nState Constitutions, and make a good Use of them, it appears to me we\r\ncannot be enslaved or materially injured.

Captn Dashwood of\r\nthis Town is going to London, to sollicit Payment of the British Crown,\r\nfor Goods taken from him when the Troops left the Town, not as\r\nforfeited, but under the Apprehension that they would be of Use to our\r\nArmy, & with an Express Promise that they should be paid for. It\r\nappears to me to be among the bona Fide Debts mention'd in the Treaty,\r\nand if there may be on the Part of the Crown itself a Failure of a\r\nCompliance with a positive stipulated Article, it will be difficult for\r\nthe Governments in America to prevail with their Citizens to think it\r\nreasonable that they should pay the just Debts owing from them to\r\nBritish Subjects. Dashwood has my Promise to write to you again on the\r\nSubject & I must fulfill it. It is with reluctance that I give you this\r\nrepeated Trouble, especially as I know you must be press'd with Affairs\r\nof greater National Importance. You are best able to say whether you\r\ncan afford him Aid or not. I have ventured to assure him, that if it be\r\nin your Power consistantly to interpose your Influence, you will\r\nundoubtedly be disposd to do it. What aggravates the Misfortune of this\r\nCitizen if he should not obtain Justice in England is that his British\r\nCrediter now demands the Payment of his Debt with Interest, & tho' this\r\nSum is very small in Comparison with the Value of the Goods taken from\r\nhim, the Payment, as he says & I suppose truly, will compleatly ruin\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nyour affectionate\r\n\r\n1 Although the copy actually transmitted, no part of this letter is in\r\nthe autograph of Adams except the subscription and signature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO RICHARD HENRY LEE.\r\n\r\n[MS., Lee Papers, American Philosophical Society; a draft is in the\r\nSamuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library; a text is in W.

He who fills that Chair is the most respected Citizen, and\r\nwhile he performs his Duty well, he adorns the most dignified Station\r\nin our Confederated Republick.\r\n\r\nYou observe in your Letter to me, that \"at this Moment, Moderation,\r\nWisdom, Firmness & Attention are the Principles proper for our\r\nAdoption.\" I agree with you, and devoutly wish that every Man who has a\r\nShare in the Administration of publick Affairs may possess a large\r\nPortion of those & other great Qualities. They are in a particular\r\nManner necessary to him who presides in the important Councils of the\r\nAmerican Amphyction.\r\n\r\nCongress has need to watch, lest the Commonwealth suffer Harm. I doubt\r\nnot they will be assiduous in their Labours for the publick Wellfare;\r\nand I pray God they may be His honord Instruments in exalting to the\r\nhighest Pitch of human Happiness that People, who have testified to the\r\noppressed World, that by Patience, Fortitude & Perseverance the iron\r\nRod can be wrested from the Arm of a Tyrant, and that all Nations may\r\nbe free, if they will magnanimously contend for their Liberty.\r\n\r\nBy Gods Blessing on the Councils & the Arms of our Country, we are now\r\nrank'd with Nations. May He keep us from exulting beyond Measure! Great\r\nPains are yet to be taken & much Wisdom is requisite that we may stand\r\nas a Nation in a respectable Character. Better it would have been for\r\nus to have fallen in our highly famed Struggle for our Rights, or even\r\nto have remaind in our ignoble State of Bondage hoping for better\r\nTimes, than now to become a contemptible Nation. The World have given\r\nus an exalted Character, & thus have laid on us a heavy Tax! They have\r\nraised Expectations from us! HOW shall we meet those Expectations? They\r\nhave attributed to us Wisdom! HOW shall we confirm them in their\r\nOpinion of us? Inexperiencd as we are in the Refinements of Nations,\r\nCan we expect to shine in the World as able Politicians? Shall we then\r\nbe hacknied in the Path of Deception because some others famed for\r\ntheir Dexterity in Politicks have long trod that Path & thought they\r\nhave gaind Advantage by it? Or, because it is said All Nations are\r\nselfinterested & that No Friendship in Treaties and National\r\nTransactions is almost as proverbial as No Friendship in Trade, shall\r\nwe depart from that excellent Rule of Equity, the Observance of which\r\nshould be characteristick of all Nations especially Republicks, as it\r\nis of all good Men, to do to others as we would have them do to us?\r\nCould we be indued thus to prostitute ourselves, HOW should we appear\r\nin the Eyes of the Virtuous & Wise? Should there be found a Citizen of\r\nthe United States so unprincipled as to ask, What will become of us if\r\nwe do not follow the corrupt Maxims of the World? I should tell him,\r\nthat the Strength of a Republick is consolidated by its Virtues, & that\r\nRighteousness will exalt a Nation.\r\n\r\nWas it true as some affirm, that the old World is absorbd in all kinds\r\nof Vice, unhumanizd & enslavd, it would indeed be a melancholly Subject\r\nto contemplate, and I should think that common Prudence would dictate\r\nto a Nation situated as we are, to have as little to do with them as\r\npossible. Such indiscriminate Censure, however, may spring from\r\nIgnorance of the World or unreasonable Prejudice. Nations as well as\r\nIndividuals have different Characters. We should not forget the\r\nFriendship & Kindness of One because we have experiencd the Injustice &\r\nCruelty of Another. But the Inconstancy of Friendship & even Infidelity\r\nhas been seen often enough among Individuals to lead wise men to\r\nsuppose it may happen in any Case & to exercise a kind of\r\nCircumspection, different from base Suspicion, consistent with the\r\ngenerous Sentiments of Friendship and, considering the Weakness of the\r\nhuman Mind, a necessary Guard.\r\n\r\nDoes not the true Policy, the Honor & Safety of our Country greatly\r\ndepend upon a National Character consisting, among other Particulars,\r\nin Simplicity & Candor in all her Publick Transactions; shewing herself\r\nin reality friendly to those to whom she professes to be a Friend--A\r\nconstant Regard to mutual Benefit in Commercial Treaties; suspecting\r\nthe Honesty of those who will not deal with her on equitable\r\nPrinciples, & guarding her Trade against their selfish Designs by wise\r\nCommercial Laws--An exact & punctilious Fullfillment of Obligations on her\r\nPart to be performd by Virtue of all Treaties-- and, An unalterable\r\nDetermination to discharge her National Debts with all possible\r\nSpeed.--If, my honord Friend, the leading Men in the United States would\r\nby Precept & Example disseminate thro' the lower Classes of People the\r\nPrinciples of Piety to God, Love to our Country & universal\r\nBenevolence, should we not secure the Favor of Heaven & the Honor &\r\nEsteem of the wise and virtuous Part of the World.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain, tho' she has concluded a Treaty of Peace with us,\r\nappears to be not a cordial Friend. She cannot forget her unparralled\r\nInjustice towards us & naturally supposes there can be no Forgiveness\r\non our Part. She seems to have meant Nothing more than a Truce. A\r\nsensible Gentleman very lately from Canada informs me, that General\r\nHaldiman who is going to England, has orderd those Posts to be\r\nreinforcd, which by Treaty were to be deliverd to us. Encroachments are\r\nmade, as I apprehend, on our Eastern Territories. Our Fishery may,\r\nunder some frivolous Pretence be next interrupted. Should we not guard\r\nourselves against British Intrigues & Factions. Her Emissaries, under\r\nthe Guise of Merchants, Repenting Refugees, Schoolmasters, and other\r\nCharacters, unless Care is taken, may effect another & fatal\r\nRevolution. The Commonwealth of England lasted twelve years, and then\r\nthe exiled King was restored with all the Rage & Madness of Royalty!--A\r\nCaution to the Citizens of the United States zealously to counteract\r\nthe Hopes our Enemies entertain of \"Discord, Disunion, & Apathy on our\r\nPart,\" to watch over the publick Liberty & Safety with a jealous Eye,\r\nand to practice the moral and political Virtues upon which the very\r\nExistence of a Commonwealth depends.\r\n\r\nMrs. Adams desires me to present her respectful Compliments to you &\r\nyour Connections.

But\r\nas I am not disposd to entertain unfavorable Thoughts of one whom I\r\nhave valued as an unchanging Friend, I will now sollicit you in Behalf\r\nof two Persons both of whom I believe you will recollect, and whose\r\nServices to the United States, in their different Way, have in my\r\nOpinion been meritorious.\r\n\r\nMr Kirkland has for many years been a Missionary to the Indians of the\r\nsix Nations under the Society in Scotland for promoting Christian\r\nKnowledge. He was recognizd by Congress & in 1779 was appointed by that\r\nBody to be Chaplain at Fort Stanwix; for this Cause that Charitable\r\nSociety forbore to continue his usual Stipend. He had Influence\r\nsufficient to keep the Indians steadily attachd to the United States\r\nduring the War, and you will judge Sir, of the Policy of engaging so\r\nuseful a Man in the same Mission under Congress, lest another should be\r\nemployed by that Society under the Pretext of promoting Christian\r\nknowledge among the Indians, [who] may be secretly instructed to\r\ninstill into their Minds Prejudices in favor of Great Britain and\r\ndangerous to our Interest. Mr Kirkland is or soon will be in New York\r\nto state his Case to Congress.\r\n\r\nColo John Allan left a valueable Estate and powerful family Connections\r\nin Hallifax in the Beginning of the late War & took a decided Part with\r\nthe United States. He had the Happiness of your Friendship when\r\nCongress sat in Baltimore; and was there appointed Superintendant of\r\nthe Indians in the Eastern Department. I do not fear I shall dishonor\r\nmyself by assuring you, that in my Opinion he has been a faithful &\r\nsuccessful Servant of the Publick. He is gone to Congress to settle his\r\nAffairs. If it shall appear to you that I have not mistaken his true\r\nCharacter, your Sense of Justice will prevent the Necessity of any\r\nSollicitation in his Behalf from, My dear Sir,\r\n\r\nyour unfeigned\r\n\r\n& affectionate friend,\r\n\r\n1 A letter by Adams to Elbridge Gerry, dated February 24, 1785, is in\r\nMagazine of American History, vol. xii., pp. 177, 178.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO RICHARD HENRY LEE.\r\n\r\n[MS., Lenox Library]\r\n\r\nBOSTON April 14 1785\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nGive me Leave to introduce to you Mr Graham1 the Bearer of this Letter\r\n& his Lady, Mrs Macauley Graham, who have honord this Town & highly\r\ngratified the virtuous Citizens by a residence of some Months past. We\r\nsometimes meet with genuine republican Sentiments in Persons born under\r\nMonarchy. It is truly mortifying when one meets with the reverse\r\nCharacter. I firmly believe that the benevolent Creator designd the\r\nrepublican Form of Government for Man.

You must not\r\nexpect it to be a long one. There are many Things which I wish to say\r\nto you, but the Tremor of my Hand is so increasd that I am put to\r\nDifficulty to guide my Pen.\r\n\r\nOur Merchants are complaining bitterly that Great Britain is ruining\r\ntheir Trade, and there is great Reason to complain; but I think much\r\ngreater, to complain of too many of the Citizens thro' the Common\r\nwealth who are imitating the Britons in every idle Amusement &\r\nexpensive Foppery which it is in their Power to invent for the\r\nDestruction of a young Country. Can our People expect to indulge\r\nthemselves in the unbounded Use of every unmeaning & fantastick\r\nExtravagance because they would follow the Lead of Europeans, & not\r\nspend all their Money? You would be surprizd to see the Equipage, the\r\nFurniture & expensive Living of too many, the Pride & Vanity of Dress\r\nwhich pervades thro every Class, confounding every Distinction between\r\nthe Poor & the Rich and evincing the Want both of Example & AEconomy.\r\n\r\nBefore this reaches you, you will have heard of the Change in our\r\nchiefe Magistrate. I confess it is what I have long wishd for. Our new\r\nGovernor1 has issued his Proclamation for the Encouragement of Piety\r\nVirtue Education & Manners and for the Suppressing of Vice. This with\r\nthe good Example of a first Magistrate & others may perhaps restore our\r\nVirtue.\r\n\r\nMonsieur le Etomb's true Decency of Manners has done honor to your\r\nLetter of Recommendation.\r\n\r\nMrs A joins in sincere Respects to your Lady & Family.\r\n\r\nAdieu my dear sir\r\n\r\n1 James Bowdoin, who had succeeded John Hancock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Adams Papers, Quincy; a draft, dated 1784, is in the Samuel Adams\r\nPapers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON 16th Augt 1785\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nThe Governour of this Commonwealth will transmit to you Copies of\r\nLetters which lately passed between him and Capt Stanhope Commander of\r\nthe British Ship of War Mercury. This is the same Person, as I am told,\r\nwho, when a Prisoner here in the early time of the War, was not too\r\ndelicate in Point of Honor to break his Parole. The Governor however\r\nhad treated him from the Time of his Arrival with the Civilities and\r\nRespect due to a Foreigner in his Station, without personal or national\r\nDistinction. The occasion of this Epistolary Correspondence which the\r\nGovernor was necessarily carried into by the Petulance of Stanhope, was\r\na Fricas which happened on the Evening of the 31st Ulto, between the\r\n[latter] and a young Sailor who alledges that he and a Number of\r\nAmerican Prisoners on board the Mercury had been flogged by Stanhopes\r\norder for refusing to do the Duty of Seamen. The Altercation caused the\r\nPeople near to collect, and the Captain, either really or pretending to\r\nbe, apprehensive of Danger, hast'ned away, a Number following excited\r\nby common Curiosity, till his Fears were quieted in the House of one of\r\nhis Friends and the Scene ended. This gave rise to Stanhopes Letter the\r\nfollowing Day. Whatever his Opinion might be of his own Importance, the\r\nGovernor considerd him entitled only to the Common Protection of the\r\nLaw, nor could he see any Obstacle in the Captains Way to obtain legal\r\nSatisfaction if he had receivd Injury, which required the extraordinary\r\nInterposition of Government; for Stanhope was the same Day abroad in\r\nthe Town without the least Molestation or appearing to be apprehensive\r\nof any Affront. Perhaps this Gentleman's Ideas of Propriety of Conduct\r\nin the Governor might have led him to expect he would take the Part of\r\na Grand Juryman or a Justice of the Peace, to enquire into\r\nMisdemeanours, or decide on little Controversies which frequently\r\nhappen among Persons who know not how to keep upon Terms with each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nI should not have troubled you with this Detail, had it not seemed to\r\nme somewhat necessary. You know it was formerly usual for such kind of\r\nMen as Stanhope appears to be, to fly to their Ships from pretended\r\nDanger, and by false representations impose on their too credulous\r\nGovernment. Adieu my friend, & believe me\r\n\r\nYours\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO RICHARD HENRY LEE.\r\n\r\n[Historical Magazine, 2d ser., vol. i., pp. 167, 168.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON Decr. 17, 1785.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR.\r\n\r\nIt gave much Pleasure to find that your Countrymen had again honour'd\r\nyou with their Confidence in Congress. My most earnest wish is, that\r\nthe Seats in that Sacred Hall may ever be filled with Men of true\r\nWisdom. This Wish, I know, cannot be gratified when the United States\r\nshall become debased in Principles and Manners. HOW much then depends\r\nupon the Exertions of the present members to perpetuate the Honour and\r\nHappiness of our Country by guarding its Virtue!\r\n\r\nI beg leave once more to trespass upon your Time by calling your\r\nattention to my Friend Captn Landais. You and I patronized him when he\r\nfirst came into this Country: and I have never for a Moment repented of\r\nthe small share I had in his Promotion in the American Navy, although\r\nhe has met with the Fate which sometimes has been the Lot of honest\r\nMen, through the errors, to say the least, of Courts. He had long\r\nsuffered as other virtuous Men had, by a Faction on the other side of\r\nthe Atlantick, which found means to extend itself to this Country, and\r\nas you well remember, to the very Doors of Congress!--But enough of\r\nthis--Your kind Assistance was greatly beneficial to him in his late\r\nApplication to Congress, and he and I gratefully acknowledged it. But\r\nhe remains still embarrassed, and as I conceive, not without Reason--His\r\nPay as Commander of the Alliance is offered to him in a Certificate.\r\nBut what is such a Piece of Paper worth. If it be said, all our brave\r\nSea Officers & Men are thus to be paid, should it not be remembered,\r\nthat those who continued in the service to the end of the War are\r\nallowed a Gratuity. This Allowance was Established several years after\r\nhe left the Service, and cannot include him, nor does he desire it--But he\r\nwas broke by a Court Martial--True. And if a private Gentleman discharges\r\nhis domestick servant even for a Fault, does he not in Justice pay him\r\nhis due wages? And are not States bound by the Rules of Justice?\r\nCaptain Landais has been obliged to pay an interest on money he has\r\nborrowed for his support and other necessary expenses, more than the\r\nValue of his Pay, and the want of his just Dues has kept him out of\r\nBusiness--He also suffers by a short Allowance of Interest on the Gratuity\r\ngranted to him for an important service. Congress ordered 12,000 Livres\r\nto be paid him for that service, in France. The Payment there would\r\nhave been and it was intended to be an advantage to him. It was paid to\r\nhim in America, and not till the last year--Should not the interest on\r\nthat sum have commenced in 1777 when the service was performed instead\r\nof 79 as it is now settled? But his greatest Grievance, in which indeed\r\nhe is a sufferer in common with others is the Detention of Prize Money\r\n--You recollect this mysterious Business and how often we were written to,\r\nand very pressingly by my worthy Friend your Brother. We have been\r\nlately told that Capt. Paul Jones has received a large sum on that\r\naccount. This Jones Captn. Landais looks upon as his inveterate Enemy &\r\nhe has not the least Confidence in him--If you think as I do that he has a\r\nRight to authentick copies of Letters written by Jones to Congress or\r\nany of the Boards on an affair so interesting to him, on his proper\r\napplication, your Advice to him on this as well as his other concerns\r\nwill add to the obligations I am already under to you.\r\n\r\nWill you be so kind as to transmit me the names of the present Members\r\nof Congress and the States they severally represent,--\r\n\r\nI am\r\n\r\nYour affectionate Friend1\r\n\r\n1 A letter by Adams to Rufus King, dated January 30, 1786, is in Life\r\nand Correspondence of Rufus King, vol. i., pp. 153, 154.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1786\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Adams Papers, Quincy; a text is in John Adams, Works, vol. ix.,\r\np. 547.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON April 13 1786\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR\r\n\r\nDoctor Gordon is to deliver you this Letter. He is going to the Land of\r\nhis Nativity, wishing for the best Happiness of his own Country & ours\r\nand hoping that mutual Affection will be at length restored, as the\r\nonly Means of the prosperity of both. As he determines to spend the\r\nRemainder of his Days in the Country where he was born, what rational\r\nMan who considers the Ties of human Nature will wonder, if \"Esto\r\nperpetua\" is his most ardent Prayer for her! But the Attachments he has\r\nmade here, his private Friendships and the Part he has taken in our\r\npublick Cause afford Reason to believe that his second Wish is for us.\r\nI am affraid however, that the Doctor builds too much upon the Hopes of\r\nthe Return of mutual Affection; for Can this exist without Forgivness\r\nof Injury, and Can his Country ever cordially forgive ours whom she\r\nintended to injure so greatly? Her very Disappointment will perpetually\r\nirritate her own Feelings and in Spite of Reason or Religion prevent\r\nher conceiving a Sentiment of Friendship for us. And besides, she will\r\nnever believe that there is a Possibility that we can forgive her. We\r\nmust therefore be content, at least for a great While to come, to live\r\nwith her as a prudent Man will with one who indeed has professd a\r\nFriendship for him, but whose Sincerity he has Reason vehemently to\r\nsuspect; guarding against Injury from him by making it his Interest to\r\ndo as little as possible. This is an arduous Task our Country has\r\ncommitted to you. Trade is a Matter I have had so little to do with,\r\nthat it is not in my Power to aid you in this more than in any one\r\nthing else. May He who has endued you with a Strength of Understanding\r\nwhich your Country confides in afford you all that Light which is\r\nnecessary for so great an Undertaking!\r\n\r\nThe Child whom I led by the Hand with a particular Design, I find is\r\nnow become a promising youth. He brought me one of your Letters--God bless\r\nthe Lad! If I was instrumental at that Time of enkindling the Sparks of\r\nPatriotism in his tender Heart, it will add to my Consolation in the\r\nlatest Hour.-- Adieu my Friend.

To effect either of these Capital Ends, we must counterwork the\r\nDesigns of Great Britain, who to say the least does not appear to be\r\nour most cordial Friend, by her Emissaries amongst us, to ruin both.\r\nThe internal Enemies of this Country ridiculed our early Ideas of\r\nOpposition, embarrassd our Measures through the whole Conflict and\r\nprolonged the War. They had nearly broke up our Army in 1782, and they\r\nare now practicing the same Arts, by influencing many weak Men to\r\nwithhold the necessary Aid of Taxes, to destroy the publick Faith. I\r\nshould therefore think it very impolitick to increase their Number by\r\nadmitting the Tory Refugees without Discrimination. Jonathan\r\nPhilanthrop whom you well knew, with many others took a very active\r\nPart, & they were very successful in promoting the Designs of the\r\nBritish Government before the War , There are some among them who would\r\nbe the fittest Instruments to be employed by that Court in tearing up,\r\nor rather undermining the Foundations of our newly erected Fabrick.--If\r\nyou ask, What has thrown me into this Fit of Zeal against the Refugees?\r\nI answer, they already have or soon will in my opinion form a dangerous\r\nFaction.

V Wells, Life of\r\nSamuel Adams, vol. in , pp. 251-253]\r\n\r\nBOSTON Decr 3d 1787\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nI am to acknowledge your several Favours of the 5th and 27 of October,\r\nthe one by the Post and the other by our worthy Friend Mr Gerry. The\r\nSession of our General Court which lasted six Weeks, and my Station\r\nthere requiring my punctual & constant Attendance, prevented my\r\nconsidering the new Constitution as it is already called, so closely as\r\nwas necessary for me before I should venture an Opinion. I confess, as\r\nI enter the Building I stumble at the Threshold. I meet with a National\r\nGovernment, instead of a Federal Union of Sovereign States. I am not\r\nable to conceive why the Wisdom of the Convention led them to give the\r\nPreference to the former before the latter. If the several States in\r\nthe Union are to become one entire Nation, under one Legislature, the\r\nPowers of which shall extend to every Subject of Legislation, and its\r\nLaws be supreme & controul the whole, the Idea of Sovereignty in these\r\nStates must be lost. Indeed I think, upon such a Supposition, those\r\nSovereignties ought to be eradicated from the Mind; for they would be\r\nImperia in Imperio justly deemd a Solecism in Politicks, & they would\r\nbe highly dangerous, and destructive of the Peace Union and Safety of\r\nthe Nation. And can this National Legislature be competent to make Laws\r\nfor the free internal Government of one People, living in Climates so\r\nremote and whose \"Habits & particular Interests\" are and probably\r\nalways will be so different. Is it to be expected that General Laws can\r\nbe adapted to the Feelings of the more Eastern and the more Southern\r\nParts of so extensive a Nation? It appears to me difficult if\r\npracticable. Hence then may we not look for Discontent, Mistrust,\r\nDisaffection to Government and frequent Insurrections, which will\r\nrequire standing Armies to suppress them in one Place & another where\r\nthey may happen to arise. Or if Laws could be made, adapted to the\r\nlocal Habits, Feelings, Views & Interests of those distant Parts, would\r\nthey not cause Jealousies of Partiality in Government which would\r\nexcite Envy and other malignant Passions productive of Wars and\r\nfighting. But should we continue distinct sovereign States,\r\nconfederated for the Purposes of mutual Safety and Happiness, each\r\ncontributing to the federal Head such a Part of its Sovereignty as\r\nwould render the Government fully adequate to those Purposes and no\r\nmore, the People would govern themselves more easily, the Laws of each\r\nState being well adapted to its own Genius & Circumstances, and the\r\nLiberties of the United States would be more secure than they can be,\r\nas I humbly conceive, under the proposed new Constitution. You are\r\nsensible, Sir, that the Seeds of Aristocracy began to spring even\r\nbefore the Conclusion of our Struggle for the natural Rights of Men,\r\nSeeds which like a Canker Worm lie at the Root of free Governments. So\r\ngreat is the Wickedness of some Men, & the stupid Servility of others,\r\nthat one would be almost inclined to conclude that Communities cannot\r\nbe free. The few haughty Families, think They must govern. The Body of\r\nthe People tamely consent & submit to be their Slaves. This unravels\r\nthe Mystery of Millions being enslaved by the few! But I must desist--My\r\nweak hand prevents my proceeding further at present. I will send you my\r\npoor Opinion of the political Structure at another Time. In the Interim\r\noblige me with your Letters; & present mine and Mrs A's best Regards to\r\nyour Lady & Family, Colo Francis, Mr A. L. if with you, & other\r\nFriends, & be assured that I am\r\n\r\nvery affectionately yours\r\n\r\nAs I thought it a Piece of Justice I have venturd to say that I had\r\noften heard from the best Patriots from Virginia that Mr G Mason was an\r\nearly active & able Advocate for the Liberties of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1789\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO RICHARD HENRY LEE.\r\n\r\n[MS., Lee Papers, American Philosophical Society; a draft is in the\r\nSamuel ,Adams Papers, Lenox Library]\r\n\r\nBOSTON April 22d, 1789.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND\r\n\r\nYou must not expect lengthy Letters from me for a Reason which I have\r\nheretofore given you. Possibly, however, I may trouble you with more\r\nfrequent Letters. I hope the federal Congress is vested with Powers\r\nadequate to all the great purposes of the federal Union; and if they\r\nhave such adequate Powers, no true and understanding Federalist would\r\nconsent that they should be trusted with more--for more would discover the\r\nFolly of the People in their wanton Grant of Power, because it might,\r\nand considering the Disposition of the human Mind, without Doubt would\r\nbe wantonly [exercised to] their Injury and Ruin. The Powers vested in\r\nGovernment by the People, the only just Source of such Powers, ought to\r\nbe critically defined and well understood; lest by a Misconstruction of\r\nambiguous Expressions, and by interested Judges too, more Power might\r\nbe assumed by the Government than the People ever intended they should\r\npossess. Few men are contented with less Power than they have a Right\r\nto exercise, the Ambition of the human Heart grasps at more. This is\r\nevinced by the Experience of all Ages.\r\n\r\nWill you give me Leave to mention to you the Name of Leonard Jarvis,\r\nEsqr; a Gentleman to whose agreable Acquaintance, tho he is a native of\r\nthis Town, I introduced myself by the Request of our worthy Friend\r\nGeneral Whipple now deceased. Mr. Jarvis is a very sensible Republican,\r\nand an honest Man. He holds the Place of Comptroller General in this\r\nCommonwealth. I believe Mr. Dalton can shew you a Specimen of his\r\nIndustry and Accuracy in Business. It is not by his Solicitation, or\r\neven knowledge that I write this. I am induced to it, because I think\r\nthat good Men living at a Distance from the Seat of the federal\r\nGovernment, and capable of serving the United States should be made\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nAdieu my dear Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE LEGISLATURE OF MASSACHUSETTS.\r\n\r\n[W. V. Wells, Life of Samuel Adams, vol. iii., pp. 284, 285; the text\r\nis also in the pamphlet Resolutions of the General Court (Boston,\r\n1789), p. 7.]\r\n\r\nMay 27, 1789.1\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT,--\r\n\r\nI have been politely notified by a joint committee of the two branches\r\nof the General Court that, having examined the returns of the votes for\r\na Lieutenant-Governor of the Commonwealth, it appears that a majority\r\nof the electors have seen fit to give me their suffrages.\r\n\r\nI am impressed with a warm sense of the honor done me, and it is a\r\npleasing reflection, in my own mind, that I have this testimonial of\r\nthe confidence of my countrymen, without my solicitation or\r\ninterference in any manner to obtain it.\r\n\r\nI rejoice in the freedom of our elections; and it affords me particular\r\nsatisfaction to be invited to take a share in government by citizens\r\npossessed of the most lively feelings of natural and civil liberty, and\r\nenlightened with the knowledge and true ends of civil government, who,\r\nin conjunction with their sister States, have gloriously contended for\r\nthe rights of mankind, and given the world another lesson, drawn from\r\nexperience, that all countries may be free, since it has pleased the\r\nrighteous Governor of the universe to smile upon their virtuous\r\nexertions, and crown them with independence and liberty.\r\n\r\nIf it be not improper on this occasion, may I beg leave to express a\r\ndevout and fervent wish that gracious Heaven may guide the public\r\ncouncils of the great confederated commonwealth, and the several free\r\nand independent republics which compose it, so that the people may be\r\nhighly respected and prosperous in their affairs abroad, and enjoy at\r\nhome that tranquillity which results from a well-grounded confidence\r\nthat their personal and domestic rights are secure.\r\n\r\nI feel, sir, a diffidence of my own abilities, and am anxious but in\r\ncertain events they may be found inadequate to the importance of the\r\nduties I may be called to perform; but relying on the aid of Divine\r\ngrace, and hoping for the justice, candor, and liberal sentiments of\r\nthe General Court and of my fellow-citizens at large, I venture to\r\naccept the trust, and am now ready to be qualified in the mode\r\nprescribed by the Constitution.\r\n\r\n1 Upon taking the oath as Lieutenant-Governor of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO RICHARD HENRY LEE.\r\n\r\n[MS., Lee Papers, American Philosophical Society.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON July 14th, 1789\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR\r\n\r\nI have not lately received a Line from you, and am ready to impute it\r\nto the Multiplicity of Affairs in which your Mind is employed. You must\r\nnot expect that I shall be even with you upon the epistolary Score, for\r\nthe Reason which I have heretofore given you. I wish to know from you\r\nthe State of federal Affairs as often as your Leisure may admit.1 We\r\norganize our State Governments, and I heartily wish that their\r\nAuthority and Dignity may be preserved within their several\r\nJurisdictions, as far as may be consistent with the Purposes for which\r\nthe federal Government is designed. They are in my opinion petit\r\nPoliticians who would wish to lessen the due Weight of the State\r\nGovernments; for I think the federal must depend upon the Influence of\r\nthese to carry their Laws into Effect; and while those Laws have for\r\ntheir sole Object the promoting the purposes of the federal Union,\r\nthere is Reason to expect they will have the due Support of the State\r\nAuthorities. Places are now become the Object of Multitudes; I\r\nmentioned to you in a former Letter the name of Leonard Jarvis, Esqr\r\nwhom I hope you will not forget. Israel Keith, Esqr wishes to have the\r\nPlace of Marshall within this District. He is a Gentleman of the Law,\r\nand was during the War Aid de Camp to General Heath, who I understand\r\nhas recommended him to the President. You will gratify the wishes of Mr\r\nKeith as far as shall consist with your own Ideas of Propriety; and be\r\nassured, that I am sincerely\r\n\r\nYour Friend,\r\n\r\nP. S. I have been informed that Mr Edward Church a Native of this Town,\r\nbut now an Inhabitant of Georgia is in the City of New York. I take him\r\nto have been a steady Friend to the Liberties of our Country, and a man\r\nof Sense and Integrity. If it will not weary you with Applications I\r\nwill beg your Notice of him, and after your own Inquiries afford him\r\nyour Influence, if you shall think it proper, in promoting him to a\r\nsuitable Employment under Congress in the State of Georgia. This I\r\nmention without his Sollicitation, or even Knowledge.\r\n\r\n1 Lee was at this time in the United States Senate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ELBRIDGE GERRY.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library]\r\n\r\nBOSTON Augt 22 1789\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nI wrote to you hastily two days ago, & as hastily venturd an Opinion\r\nconcerning the Right of Congress to controul a Light-house erected on\r\nLand belonging to this sovereign & independent State for its own Use &\r\nat its own Expence. I say sovereign & independent, because I think the\r\nState retains all the Rights of Sovereignty which it has not expressly\r\nparted with to the Congress of the United States--a federal Power\r\ninstituted solely for the Support of the federal Union.\r\n\r\nThe Sovereignty of the State extends over every part of its Territory.\r\nThe federal Constitution expresses the same Idea in Sec. 8, Art. 1. A\r\nPower is therein given to Congress \"to exercise like Authority,\" that\r\nis to exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, \"over all\r\nplaces purchased by the Consent of the Legislature in which the same\r\nshall be, for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, and other needful\r\nBuildings,\" among which Light-houses may be included. Is it not the\r\nplain Conclusion from this Clause in the Compact, that Congress have\r\nnot the Right to exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases\r\nwhatsoever, nor even to purchase or controul any part of the Territory\r\nwithin a State for the Erection of needful Buildings unless it has the\r\nConsent of its Legislature. If there are any such Buildings already\r\nerected, which operate to the General Welfare of the U S, and Congress\r\nby Virtue of the Power vested in them have taken from a State for the\r\ngeneral Use, the necessary Means of supporting such Buildings it\r\nappears to be reasonable & just that the U S should maintain them; but\r\nI think that it follows not from hence, that Congress have a right to\r\nexercise any Authority over those buildings even to make Appointments\r\nof officers for the immediate Care of them or furnishing them with\r\nnecessary Supplies. I wish to have your Opinion if you can find Leisure.\r\n\r\nI hope Congress, before they adjourn, will take into very serious\r\nConsideration the necessary Amendments of the Constitution. Those whom\r\nI call the best--the most judicious & disinterested Federalists, who wish\r\nfor the perpetual Union, Liberty & Happiness of the States & their\r\nrespective Citizens, many of them if not all are anxiously expecting\r\nthem. They wish to see a Line drawn as clearly as may be, between the\r\nfederal Powers vested in Congress and the distinct Sovereignty of the\r\nseveral States upon which the private & personal Rights of the Citizens\r\ndepend. Without such Distinction there will be Danger of the\r\nConstitution issuing imperceptibly and gradually into a consolidated\r\nGovernment over all the States; which, altho it may be wished for by\r\nsome was reprobated in the Idea by the highest Advocates for the\r\nConstitution as it stood without Amendmts. I am fully persuaded that\r\nthe population of the U S livg in different Climates, of different\r\nEducation and Manners, and possest of different Habits & feelings under\r\none consolidated Governt can not long remain free, or indeed remain\r\nunder any kind of Governt but despotism.\r\n\r\nYou will not forget our old Friend Devens, and if you please mention\r\nhim to Mr R H Lee.\r\n\r\nAdieu my dear Friend and believe me to be sincerely your,\r\n\r\nP. S. The joint regards of Mrs A & myself to Mrs Gerry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO RICHARD HENRY LEE.\r\n\r\n[MS., Lee Papers, American Philosophical Society; a draft is in the\r\nSamuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON August 24th 1789.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nYour very acceptable Letter of the 8th Current came to me by the Post.\r\nYou flatter me very much when you tell me that any sentiment of mine\r\ncan please you. I have always been apprehensive that through the\r\nweakness of the human Mind often discovered even in the wisest and best\r\nof Men, or the perverseness of the interested, and designing, in as\r\nwell as out of Government; Misconstructions would be given to the\r\nfederal constitution, which would disappoint the Views, and\r\nexpectations of the honest among those who acceded to it, and hazard\r\nthe Liberty, Independence and Happiness of the People. I was\r\nparticularly affraid that unless great care should be taken to prevent\r\nit, the Constitution in the Administration of it would gradually, but\r\nswiftly and imperceptably run into a consolidated Government pervading\r\nand legislating through all the States, not for federal purposes only\r\nas it professes, but in all cases whatsoever: such a Government would\r\nsoon totally annihilate the Sovereignty of the several States so\r\nnecessary to the Support of the confederated Commonwealth, and sink\r\nboth in despotism. I know these have been called vulgar opinions, and\r\nprejudices: be it so--I think it is Lord Shaftsbury who tells us, that it\r\nis folly to despise the opinions of the Vulgar; this Aphorism, if\r\nindeed it is his, I eagerly catched from a Nobleman many years ago,\r\nwhose writings on some accounts, I never much admired. Should a strong\r\nFederalist as some call themselves see what has now dropt from my Pen,\r\nhe would say that I am an Antifed, an Amendment Monger &c; those are\r\ntruly vulgar terms, invented and used by some whose feelings would be\r\nsorely wounded to be ranked among such kind of Men, and invented and\r\nused for the mean purpose of deceiving, and entrapping others whom they\r\ncall the Vulgar; but in this \"enlightned\" Age one should think there\r\nwas no such Vulgar to be thus amused, and ensnared. I mean, my friend,\r\nto let you know how deeply, I am impressed with a sense of the\r\nImportance of Amendments; that the good People may clearly see the\r\ndistinction, for there is a distinction, between the federal Powers\r\nvested in Congress, and the sovereign Authority belonging to the\r\nseveral States, which is the Palladium of the private, and personal\r\nrights of the Citizens. I freely protest to you that I earnestly wish\r\nsome Amendments may be judiciously, and deliberately made without\r\npartial or local considerations--that there may be no uncomfortable\r\nJarrings among the several Powers; that the whole People may in every\r\nState contemplate their own safety on solid grounds, and the Union of\r\nthe States be perpetual. I hope that you have recovered your health, so\r\nvaluable to our Country. Your Letter requires a further Consideration.\r\nI will at present only express my astonishment at the strange and\r\nabsurd Opinion of our former republican Connecticut friend. Tempora\r\nmutantur, et hic mutatur in illis.\r\n\r\nYour friend,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO RICHARD HENRY LEE.\r\n\r\n[MS., Lee Papers, American Philosophical Society, a draft is in the\r\nSamuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON Augt 29th. 1789.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nThe Power of removing federal Officers at the Pleasure of the President\r\nis to be found the Constitution or it is not. If it is, What Need was\r\nthere of an Act or Decision of Congress to authorize it? But if it is\r\nnot, could Congress give so important a Power? What have the United\r\nStates been contending for? Liberty. This is the great Object of their\r\nState Governments, and has not the federal Constitution the same Object\r\nin View? If therefore a Doubt arises respecting the Exercise of any\r\nPower, no Construction, I conceive, should militate with the main\r\nDesign, or Object of the Charter. If there is a total Silence in the\r\nConstitution, is it not natural to conclude that an Officer holding\r\nduring Pleasure is removable by the same Power which appointed him,\r\nwhether vested in a single Person, or a joint Number? I am sensible, it\r\nis said, that a single Person, being amenable for his Exercise of Power\r\nwill use the utmost Circumspection. This may be true, but may not this\r\nIdea be carried too far in Practice? May not some Powers vested in a\r\nsingle Man give him such Weight and Influence as to render any\r\nRestraint from his feeling himself amenable of little, or no Effect. If\r\nthis Power lodged in the Discretion of a single Person will afford a\r\ngreater Security against Corruption because of his Amenability, why\r\nshould not the Power of appointing as well as removing Officers be\r\ngiven to him? In the one Case the gracious Hand may be held forth, in\r\nthe other, the threatning Rod; and both may be used for improper\r\nPurposes. In England, \"the King can do no wrong\" is a Maxim. His\r\nMinisters are made accountable for him; and how often have corrupt\r\nMinisters and Councellors been brought to the Block for Follies and\r\nCrimes committed by their Royal Masters who can do no Wrong? And it may\r\nalso be asked, how often such Ministers and Councellors have found\r\nMeans to get themselves screened from Punishment through the Influence\r\nof their Masters, by procuring Parliamentary Sanctions to such Crimes\r\nand Follies? But in the Removal of Officers the President has not a\r\nConstitutional Council. He must therefore be solely accountable. I need\r\nnot tell you who have known so thoroughly the Sentiments of my Heart,\r\nthat I have always had a very high Esteem for the late Commander in\r\nChief of our Armies; and I now most sincerely believe that while\r\nPresident Washington continues in the Chair he will be able to give to\r\nall good Men a satisfactory Reason for every Instance of his public\r\nConduct. I feel myself constrained contrary to my usual Manner to make\r\nProfessions of Sincerity on this Occasion because Dr Gordon in his\r\nHistory of the Revolution, among many other Anecdotes innocent and\r\ntriffling enough, has gravely said, that I was concerned in an Attempt\r\nto remove General Washington from Command; and mentions an anonymous\r\nLetter written to your late Governor Henry which I affirm I never saw\r\nnor heard of till I lately met with it in reading the History1--This is a\r\nDigression to which a Man of my years is liable. Who will succeed the\r\npresent President for it is the Lot of Man to die? Perhaps the next and\r\nthe next may inherit his Virtues. But my Friend, I fear the Time will\r\ncome, when a Bribe shall remove the most excellent Man from Office for\r\nthe Purpose of making Room for the worst. It will be called an Error in\r\nJudgment. The Bribe will be concealed. It may however be vehemently\r\nsuspected & who, in Times of great Degeneracy will venture to search\r\nout and detect the corrupt Practices of great Men? Unless a sufficient\r\nCheck is provided and clearly ascertained for every Power given, will\r\nnot the Constitution and the Liberties of the Citizens for want of such\r\nChecks be finally subverted.\r\n\r\nA Gentleman of this Place who has suffered much for his Attachment to\r\nour Cause I conceive has Documents in his Hands which would be of\r\nImportance in the Settlement of the Eastern Boundary of the United\r\nStates which appears to have been encroached upon by the British. I\r\nwrote so long ago as last April to Mr Dalton respecting this Gentleman;\r\nbut have never received an Answer. He I suppose is able to give you an\r\nAccount of Mr Boyd the Name of the Gentleman referred to. I wish you\r\nwould converse with Mr Dalton upon the Subject. The Vice President\r\nhowever is probably able, and undoubtedly disposed to give you the\r\nfullest Account. I am sincerely yours\r\n\r\nP. S. Pray write to me and let me know the State of your Health, & pay\r\nmy affectionate Regards to your Brother the Doctor.\r\n\r\n1 William Gordon, History of the American Revolution, (3rd Amer. edit.)\r\nvol. ii., p. 306.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1790\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE LEGISLATURE OF MASSACHUSETTS.\r\n\r\nMAY 28, 1790.1\r\n\r\n[W. V. Wells, Life of Samuel Adams, vol. in., pp. 288, 289; a text is\r\nin the Massachusetts Archives.]\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT,--\r\n\r\nHaving been regularly informed that a majority of the late electors in\r\nthe several towns and districts within this Commonwealth have honored\r\nme with their suffrages for the office of Lieutenant-Governor, I now\r\npresent myself before the two branches of the General Court to be\r\nqualified as the Constitution directs. I do the more readily obey this\r\nrepeated call, because I cannot help flattering myself that it has\r\nproceeded from a persuasion in the minds of my fellow-citizens of the\r\nattachment of my heart to their rights and liberties, and my earnest\r\ndesires that they may be perpetuated. My fellow-citizens may be assured\r\nthat I feel that attachment and the strength of those desires. The\r\nfirst of my wishes, as they respect this life, is for our country; and\r\nthe best of my feeble abilities shall be ever employed for her\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nI shall presently be called upon by you, sir, as it is enjoined by the\r\nConstitution, to make a declaration upon oath (and shall do it with\r\ncheerfulness, because the injunction accords with my own judgment and\r\nconscience) that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is, and of right\r\nought to be, a free, sovereign, and independent State. I shall also be\r\ncalled upon to make another declaration, with the same solemnity, to\r\nsupport the Constitution of the United States. I see the consistency of\r\nthis, for it cannot have been intended but that these Constitutions\r\nshould mutually aid and support each other. It is my humble opinion\r\nthat, while the Commonwealth of Massachusetts maintains her own just\r\nauthority, weight, and dignity, she will be among the firmest pillars\r\nof the Federal Union.\r\n\r\nMay the administration of the Federal government, and those of the\r\nseveral States in the Union, be guided by the unerring finger of\r\nHeaven! Each of them and all of them united will then, if the people\r\nare wise, be as prosperous as the wisdom of human institutions and the\r\ncircumstances of human society will admit.\r\n\r\n1 Upon taking office as Lieutenant-Governor, to which office he was\r\nalso elected in 1791 and 1792.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Adams Papers, Quincy.1]\r\n\r\nBOSTON Septemr 2d 1790\r\n\r\nSR\r\n\r\nI have not written a single line to any friend in, or out of Congress\r\nduring the late session, having been prevented by my old nervous\r\ndisorder, and am now dictating this to a confidential friend, whom you\r\nwell know.\r\n\r\nCapn Nathaniel Byfield Lyde who commanded the Ship in which your Lady\r\nsailed to England has informed me that a number of Vessells are to be\r\nbuilt, and employed to guard the coast for a preventing of breaches of\r\nthe act of trade; and he requests me to ask the favour of you to\r\nmention his Name to the President of the United States for a command.

V.

I have not studied the Prophesies, and cannot even\r\nconjecture. The Golden Age so finely pictured by Poets, I believe has\r\nnever yet existed; but in their own imaginations. In the earliest\r\nperiods, when for the honor of human nature, one should have thought,\r\nthat man had not learnt to be cruel; what Scenes of horror have been\r\nexhibited in families of some of the best instructors in Piety and\r\nmorals! Even the heart of our first father was grievously wounded at\r\nthe sight of the murder of one of his Sons, perpetrated by the hand of\r\nthe other. Has Mankind since seen the happy Age? No, my friend. The\r\nsame Tragedys have been acted on the Theatre of the World, the same\r\nArts of tormenting have been studied, and practiced to this day; and\r\ntrue religion, and reason united have never succeeded to establish the\r\npermanent foundations of political freedom, and happiness in the most\r\nenlightened Countries on the Earth. After a compliment to Boston Town\r\nmeetings, and our Harvard College as having \"set the universe in\r\nMotion\"; you tell me Every Thing will be pulled down; I think with you,\r\n\"So much seems certain,\" but what say you, will be built up? Hay, wood\r\nand stubble, may probably be the materials, till Men shall be yet more\r\nenlightened, and more friendly to each other. \"Are there any Principles\r\nof Political Architecture?\" Undoubtedly. \"What are they?\" Philosophers\r\nancient, and modern, have laid down different plans, and all have\r\nthought themselves, masters of the true Principles. Their Disciples\r\nhave followed them, probably with a blind prejudice, which is always an\r\nEnemy to truth, and have thereby added fresh fuel to the fire of\r\nContention, and increased the political disorder. Kings have been\r\ndeposed by aspiring Nobles, whose pride could not brook restraint.\r\nThese have waged everlasting War, against the common rights of Men. The\r\nLove of Liberty is interwoven in the soul of Man, and can never be\r\ntotally extinguished; and there are certain periods when human patience\r\ncan no longer endure indignity, and oppression. The spark of liberty\r\nthen kindles into a flame; when the injured people attentive to the\r\nfeelings of their just rights magnanimously contend for their compleat\r\nrestoration. But such contests have too often ended in nothing more\r\nthan \"a change of Impostures, and impositions\". The Patriots of Rome\r\nput an End to the Life of Caesar; and Rome submitted to a Race of\r\nTyrants in his stead. Were the People of England free, after they had\r\nobliged King John to concede to them their ancient rights, and\r\nLibertys, and promise to govern them according to the Old Law of the\r\nLand? Were they free, after they had wantonly deposed their Henrys,\r\nEdwards, and Richards to gratify family pride? Or, after they had\r\nbrought their first Charles to the block, and banished his family? They\r\nwere not. The Nation was then governed by Kings, Lords, and Commons,\r\nand its Libertys were lost by a strife among three Powers, soberly\r\nintended to check each other, and keep the scales even. But while we\r\ndaily see the violence of the human passions controuling the Laws of\r\nReason and religion, and stifling the very feelings of humanity; can we\r\nwonder, that in such tumults little or no regard is had to Political\r\nChecks and Ballances? And such tumults have always happened within as\r\nwell as without doors. The best formed constitutions that have yet been\r\ncontrived by the wit of Man have, and will come to an End--because \"the\r\nKingdoms of the Earth have not been governed by Reason.\" The Pride of\r\nKings, of Nobles, and leaders of the People who have all governed in\r\ntheir turns, have disadjusted the delicate frame, and thrown all into\r\nconfusion. What then is to be done?--Let Divines, and Philosophers,\r\nStatesmen and Patriots unite their endeavours to renovate the Age, by\r\nimpressing the Minds of Men with the importance of educating their\r\nlittle boys, and girls--of inculcating in the Minds of youth the fear, and\r\nLove of the Deity, and universal Phylanthropy; and in subordination to\r\nthese great principles, the Love of their Country--of instructing them in\r\nthe Art of self government, without which they never can act a wise\r\npart in the Government of Societys great, or small--in short of leading\r\nthem in the Study, and Practice of the exalted Virtues of the Christian\r\nsystem, which will happily tend to subdue the turbulent passions of\r\nMen, and introduce that Golden Age beautifully described in figurative\r\nlanguage; when the Wolf shall dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard lie\r\ndown with the Kid--the Cow, and the bear shall feed; their young ones\r\nshall lie down together, and the Lyon shall eat straw like the Ox--none\r\nshall then hurt, or destroy; for the Earth shall be full of the\r\nKnowledge of the Lord. When this Millenium shall commence, if there\r\nshall be any need of Civil Government, indulge me in the fancy that it\r\nwill be in the republican form, or something better.\r\n\r\nI thank you for your Countenance to our friend Lyde. Mrs Adams tells me\r\nto remember her to yourself, Lady, and connections; And be assured that\r\nI am sincerely\r\n\r\nyour friend,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Adams Papers, Quincy; a draft is in the Samuel Adams Papers,\r\nLenox Library; the text with variations is in John Adams, Works, vol.\r\nvi., pp. 420-426, W.

Certain texts give the date as November 20.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON Novemr 25th 1790\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nI lately received your Letter of the 18th of October.--The Sentiment, and\r\nobservations contained in it demand my attention.\r\n\r\nA Republic, you tell me, is a Government in which \"the People have an\r\nessential share in the sovereignty;\" Is not the whole sovereignty, my\r\nfriend, essentially in the People? Is not Government designed for the\r\nWelfare and happiness of all the People? and is it not the\r\nuncontroulable essential right of the People to amend, and alter, or\r\nannul their Constitution, and frame a new one, whenever they shall\r\nthink it will better promote their own welfare, and happiness to do it?\r\nThat the Sovereignty resides in the People is a political doctrine\r\nwhich I have never heard an American Politician seriously deny. The\r\nConstitutions of the American States reserve to the People the exercise\r\nof the rights of Sovereignty; by the annual, or biennial elections of\r\ntheir Governours, Senators, & Representatives; and by empowering their\r\nown Representatives to impeach the greatest officers of the State,\r\nbefore the Senators who are also chosen by themselves.\r\n\r\nWe the people is the stile of the federal Constitution. They adopted\r\nit; and conformably to it, they delegate the exercise of the Powers of\r\nGovernment to particular persons, who, after short intervals resign\r\ntheir Powers to the People, and they will re-elect them, or appoint\r\nothers, as1 they think fit.\r\n\r\nThe American Legislatures are nicely balanced: They consist of two\r\nbranches, each having a check upon the determinations of the other:\r\nthey sit in different chambers, and probably often reason differently\r\nin their respective chambers, on the same question-- if they disagree in\r\ntheir decisions, by a conference their reasons, and Arguments are\r\nmutually communicated to each other: Candid explanations tend to bring\r\nthem to agreement; and then according to the Massachusetts\r\nconstitution, the matter is laid before the first Magistrate for his\r\nrevision. He states objections, if he has any, with his Reasons, and\r\nreturns them to the Legislators, who by larger Majorities ultimately\r\ndecide. Here is a mixture of three Powers founded in the Nature of Man;\r\ncalculated to call forth the rational Faculties in the great points of\r\nLegislation, into exertion; to cultivate mutual Friendship, and good\r\nhumour; and finally to enable them to decide, not by the impulse of\r\npassion, or party prejudice, but the calm Voice of Reason, which is the\r\nVoice of God:--In this mixture you may see your \"natural, and actual\r\nAristocracy among mankind,\" operating among the several Powers in\r\nLegislation, and producing the most happy Effects. But the Son of an\r\nexcellent Man may never inherit the great qualities of his father; this\r\nis common observation, and there are many instances of its truth:\r\nShould we not therefore conclude that hereditary Nobility is a solecism\r\nin Government? Their Lordships Sons, or Grandsons may be destitute of\r\nthe faintest feelings of honor, or honesty; and yet retain an essential\r\nshare in the Government by right of inheritance from Ancestors, who may\r\nhave been the Minions of ministers--the favourites of Mistresses, or Men\r\nof real, and distinguished Merit. The same may be said of hereditary\r\nKings; Their Successors may also become so degenerated, and corrupt, as\r\nto have neither inclination, nor capacity to know the extent, and\r\nLimits of their own Powers, nor consequently those of others. Such kind\r\nof Political Beings, Nobles, or Kings, possessing hereditary right to\r\nessential shares in an equipoized Government are very unfit persons to\r\nhold the scales; Having no just conception of the Principles of the\r\nGovernment, nor of the part which they, and their copartners bear in\r\nthe administration; they run a wild career, destroy the checks, and\r\nballances, by interfering in each others departments, till the Nation\r\nis involved in confusion, and reduced to the danger, at least, of\r\nBloodshed to remove a Tyranny, which may ensue. Much safer is it, and\r\nmuch more does it tend to promote the Welfare and happiness of Society\r\nto fill up the offices of Government after the mode prescribed in the\r\nAmerican Constitution, by frequent Elections of the People. They may\r\nindeed be deceived in their choice; they sometimes are; but the Evil is\r\nnot incurable; the Remedy is always near; they will feel their\r\nmistakes, and correct them.\r\n\r\nI am very willing to agree with you in thinking, that improvement in\r\nKnowledge, and Benevolence receive much assistance from the principles,\r\nand Systems of good Government: But is it not as true that without\r\nknowledge, and benevolence Men would neither have been capable or\r\ndisposed to search for the principles, or form the System--Should we not,\r\nmy friend, bear a gratefull remembrance of our pious and benevolent\r\nAncestors, who early laid plans of Education; by which means Wisdom,\r\nKnowledge, and Virtue have been generally diffused among the body of\r\nthe people, and they have been enabled to form and establish a civil\r\nconstitution calculated for the preservation of their rights, and\r\nliberties. This Constitution was evidently founded in the expectation\r\nof the further progress, and \"extraordinary degrees\" of virtue. It\r\ninjoyns the encouragement of all Seminaries of Literature, which are\r\nthe nurseries of Virtue depending upon these for the support of\r\nGovernment, rather than Titles, Splendor, or Force. Mr Hume may call\r\nthis a \"Chimerical Project.\" I am far from thinking the People can be\r\ndeceived by urging upon them a dependance on the more general\r\nprevalence of Knowledge, and Virtue: It is one of the most essential\r\nmeans of further, and still further improvements in Society, and of\r\ncorrecting, and amending moral sentiments, and habits, and political\r\ninstitutions; till \"by human means\" directed by divine influence, Men\r\nshall be prepared for that \"happy, and holy State\" when the Messiah is\r\nto reign.\r\n\r\n\"It is a fixed Principle that all good Government is, and must be\r\nRepublican.\" You have my hearty concurrence; and I believe we are well\r\nenough acquainted with each others Ideas to understand what we\r\nrespectively mean when we \"use the Word with approbation.\" The Body of\r\nthe People in this Country are not so ignorant as those of England were\r\nin the Time of the Interregnum Parliament. They are better educated:\r\nthey will not easily be prevailed upon to believe that a Republican is\r\n\"as unamiable as a Witch, a Blasphemer, a Rebel, or a Tyrant.\" They are\r\ncharmed with their forms of Government, in which is admitted a mixture\r\nof Powers to check the human passions, and controul them from rushing\r\ninto exorbitances. So well assured are they, that their liberties are\r\nbest secured, by their own frequent, and free Election of fit persons\r\nto be the essential sharers in the administration of their Government,\r\nand that this form of Government is truly Republic, that the body of\r\nthe People will not be perswaded nor compelled to \"renounce, detest,\r\nand execrate the very Word Republican as the English do.\" Their\r\nEducation has \"confirmed them in the opinion of the necessity of\r\npreserving, and strengthening the Dykes against the Ocean, its Tydes,\r\nand Storms,\" and I think they have made more safe, and more durable\r\nDykes, than the English have done.\r\n\r\nWe agree in the Utility of universal Education, but \"will nations agree\r\nin it as fully, and extensively as we do\"? Why should they not? It\r\nwould not be fair to conclude, that because they have not yet been\r\ndisposed to agree in it, they never will. It is allowed, that the\r\npresent age is more enlightened than former ones. Freedom of enquiry is\r\ncertainly more encouraged: The feelings of humanity have softned the\r\nheart: The true principles of civil, and religious Liberty are better\r\nunderstood: Tyranny in all its shapes, is more detested, and bigotry,\r\nif not still blind, must be mortified to see that she is despised. Such\r\nan age may afford at least a flattering Expectation that Nations, as\r\nwell as individuals, will view the utility of universal Education in so\r\nstrong a light as to induce sufficient national Patronage, and Support.\r\nFuture Ages will probably be more enlightned than this.\r\n\r\nThe Love of Liberty is interwoven in the Soul of Man. \"So it is in that\r\nof a Wolf;\" However irrational, ungenerous, and unsocial the love of\r\nliberty may be in a rude Savage, he is capable of being enlightned by\r\nExperience, Reflection, Education, and civil, and Political\r\nInstitutions. But the Nature of the Wolf is, and ever will be confined\r\nto running in the forest to satisfy his hunger, and his brutal\r\nappetites; the Dog is inclined in a more easy way to seek his living,\r\nand fattens his sides with what comes from his masters kitchen. The\r\nComparison of La Fontaine is in my opinion ungenerous, unnatural, and\r\nunjust.\r\n\r\nAmong the Numbers of Men, my friend, are to be found not only those who\r\nhave \"preferred ease, slumber, and good chear to liberty\"; but others,\r\nwho have eagerly sought after Thrones, and Sceptres, hereditary shares\r\nin Sovereignty Riches, and Splendor, Titles, Stars, Garters, Crosses,\r\nEagles, and many other childish play things, at the expence of real\r\nNobility, without one thought, or care for the liberty, and happiness\r\nof the rest of Mankind. \"The People, who have no property feel the\r\nPower of governing by a majority; and even attack those who have\r\nproperty.\" \"The injured Men of Property recur to finess, trick, and\r\nStratagem,\" to outwit them: True; These may proceed from a Lust of\r\ndomination in some of both parties. Be this as it may; It has been\r\nknown, that such deceitful tricks have been practiced by some of the\r\nrich upon their unsuspecting fellow Citizens; to turn the determination\r\nof Questions, so as to answer their own selfish purposes. To plunder or\r\nfilch the rights of Men are crimes equally immoral, and nefarious;\r\nthough committed in a different manner: Neither of them is confined to\r\nthe Rich, or the Poor; they are too common among both. The Lords as\r\nwell as the commons of Great Brittain by continued large majorities\r\nendeavoured by Finess, Tricks, and Stratagems, as well as threats to\r\nprevail on the American Colonies to surrender their Liberty and\r\nProperty to their disposal. These failing, they attempted to plunder\r\nour rights by force of Arms. We feared their Arts more than their Arms.\r\nDid the Members of that hereditary House of Lords, who constituted\r\nthose repeated majorities, then possess the spirit of Nobility? Not so,\r\nI think: That Spirit resided in the illustrious Minorities in both\r\nHouses. But \"by Nobles\" who have prevented \"one hideous Despotism as\r\nhorrid as that of Turkey from falling to the lot of every Nation of\r\nEurope\"; you mean not peculiarly an hereditary Nobility, or any\r\nparticular Modification, but \"the natural, and actual Aristocracy among\r\nMankind;\" The existence of which, I am not disposed to deny. Where is\r\nthis Aristocracy to be found? Among Men of all Ranks and Conditions.\r\nThe Cottager may beget a wise Son; the Noble, a Fool: The one is\r\ncapable of great Improvement--the other not. Education is within the Power\r\nof Men, and Societys of Men. Wise, and judicious Modes of Education,\r\npatronized, and supported by communities, will draw together the Sons\r\nof the rich, and the poor, among whom it makes no distinction; it will\r\ncultivate the natural Genius, elevate the Soul, excite laudable\r\nEmulation to excel in Knowledge, Piety, and Benevolence, and finally it\r\nwill reward its Patrons, and Benefactors by sheding its benign\r\nInfluence on the Public Mind. Education inures Men to thinking and\r\nreflection, to reasoning and demonstration. It discovers to them the\r\nmoral and religious duties they owe to God, their Country and to all\r\nMankind. Even Savages might, by the means of Education, be instructed\r\nto frame the best civil, and political Institutions with as much skill\r\nand ingenuity, as they now shape their Arrows. Education leads youth to\r\n\"the Study of human nature, society, and universal History\" from whence\r\nthey may \"draw all the Principles\" of Political Architecture, which\r\nought to be regarded. All Men are \"interested in the truth.\" Education\r\nby showing them \"the End of all its consequences\" would induce, at\r\nleast, the greatest numbers to inlist on its side. The Man of good\r\nunderstanding who has been well educated, and improves these advantages\r\nas far as his circumstances will allow, in promoting the happiness of\r\nMankind, in my opinion, and I am inclined to think in yours is indeed\r\n\"well born.\" It may be \"puerile, and unworthy of Statesmen\" to declame\r\nagainst Family Pride; but there is and always has been such a\r\nridiculous kind of Vanity among Men. \"Statesmen know the evil, and\r\ndanger is too serious to be sported with.\" I am content they should be\r\nput into one hole; as you propose, but I have some fears that your\r\nWatchmen on each side will not well agree. When a Man can recollect the\r\nVirtues of his Ancestors; he certainly has abundantly more solid\r\nsatisfaction than another who boasts that he sprang from those, who\r\nwere rich, or noble; but never discovers the least degree of Virtue, or\r\ntrue worth of any kind. \"Family Popularity,\" if I mistake not, has its\r\nsource in family pride; It is by all means sought after that hommage\r\nmay be paid to the name of the Title or Estate, to supply the want, in\r\nthe possessor, of any great, or good quality whatsoever. There are\r\nindividuals among Men, who study the art of making themselves popular,\r\nfor the purpose of getting into Places of Honour, and Emoluments, and\r\nby these means of gratifying hereafter the noble Passion--Family Pride.\r\nOthers are so inchanted with the Musick of the sound, that they\r\nconceive it to be supreme felicity. This is indeed Vanity of Vanities,\r\nand if such deluded Men ever come to their Senses, they will find it to\r\nbe vexation of Spirit. When they reflect on their own folly, and\r\ninjustice in having received the breath of Applause with avidity, and\r\ngreat delight, for Merrit which they are conscious they never had; and\r\nthat many who have been the loudest in sounding their praises, had\r\nnothing in view, but their own private, and selfish interests, it will\r\nexcite in them the feelings of shame, remorse, and self contempt.\r\n\r\nThe truly virtuous Man, and real Patriot, is satisfied with the\r\napprobation of the wise, and discerning; he rejoices in the\r\ncontemplation of the Purity of his Intentions, and waits in humble hope\r\nfor the Plaudit of his final Judge.\r\n\r\nI shall hardly venture again to trespass on the Benevolence of our\r\nConfidential Friend--you will not be sorry; it will afford you Reliefe,\r\nfor in common Civility you must be at the Trouble of reading ones\r\nEpistles. I hope there will be a Time when we shall have \"sweet\r\nCommunion\" together. In the mean Time let me not lose the Benefit of\r\nyour valueable Letters. Adieu. Believe me\r\n\r\nYour sincere Friend\r\n\r\n1 The draft at this point reads: \"as in their own enlightened Judgments\r\nshall best serve the great End of Government the good of the whole\r\nPeople.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1794\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE LEGISLATURE OF MASSACHUSETTS.\r\n\r\nJANUARY 17, 1794.\r\n\r\n[Independent Chronicle, January 20, 1794; the text is in W. V. Wells,\r\nLife of Samuel Adams, vol. iii., pp. 324-328, and in the Massachusetts\r\nArchives.]\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE\r\n\r\nTWO BRANCHES OF THE LEGISLATURE,\r\n\r\nIT having pleased the Supreme Being, since your last meeting, in His\r\nholy providence to remove from this transitory life, our late excellent\r\nGovernour Hancock, the multitude of his surviving fellow-citizens, who\r\nhave often given strong testimonials of their approbation of his\r\nimportant services, while they drop a tear, may certainly profit by the\r\nrecollection of his virtuous and patriotic example.\r\n\r\nYou are sensible, that on this melancholly event, our Constitution\r\ndirects that the Lieutenant Governour,1 for the time being, shall\r\nperform all the duties which were incumbent on him, and exercise all\r\nthe powers and authorities, during the vacancy of the chair, which by\r\nthe Constitution, he was vested with when personally present. Diffident\r\nas I am of my abilities, I have yet felt myself constrained, to\r\nundertake the performance of those duties, and the exercise of those\r\npowers and authorities, in consequence of a sovereign act of God. To\r\nHim I look for that wisdom which is profitable to direct. The\r\nConstitution must be my rule, and the true interest of my Constituents,\r\nwhose agent I am, my invariable object.\r\n\r\nThe people of this Commonwealth, have heretofore been possessed of the\r\nintire sovereignty within and over their own territories. They were\r\n\"not controul-able by any other laws than those to which their\r\nconstituted representative body gave their consent.\" This, I presume,\r\nwas the case in every other State of the Union.--But, after the memorable\r\ndeclaration of their Independence was by solemn treaty, agreed to and\r\nratified by the British King, the only power that could have any\r\npretence to dispute it, they considered themselves decidedly free and\r\nindependent of all other people. Having taken rank among nations, it\r\nwas judged that their great affairs could not well be conducted under\r\nthe direction of a number of distinct sovereignties. They therefore\r\nformed and adopted a Federal Constitution; by which certain powers of\r\nsovereignty are delegated and entrusted to such persons as they shall\r\njudge proper from time to time to elect; to be exercised conformably\r\nto, and within the restrictions of the said Constitution, for the\r\npurposes of strengthening and confirming the Union, and promoting the\r\nsafety and happiness of the confederate Commonwealth. All powers not\r\nvested in Congress, remain in the separate States to be exercised\r\naccording to their respective Constitutions.--Should not unremitting\r\ncaution be used, least any degree of interference or infringement might\r\ntake place, either on the rights of the Federal Government on the one\r\nside, or those of the several States on the other. Instances of this\r\nkind may happen; for infallibility is not the lot of any man or body of\r\nmen, even the best of them on earth. The human mind in its present\r\nstate, being very imperfect, is liable to a multitude of errors.\r\nPrejudice, that great source of error, often creeps in and takes\r\npossession of the hearts of honest men, without even their perceiving\r\nit themselves. Honest men will not feel themselves disgusted, when\r\nmistakes are pointed out to them with decency, candor and friendship,\r\nnor will they, when convinced of truth, think their own dignity\r\ndegraded by correcting their own errors. Among the objects of the\r\nConstitution of this Commonwealth, Liberty and Equality stand in a\r\nconspicuous light. It is the first article in our Declaration of\r\nrights, \"all men are born free and equal, and have certain natural,\r\nessential and unalienable rights.\" In the supposed state of nature, all\r\nmen are equally bound by the laws of nature, or to speak more properly,\r\nthe laws of the Creator:--They are imprinted by the finger of God on the\r\nheart of man. Thou shall do no injury to thy neighbour, is the voice of\r\nnature and reason, and it is confirmed by written revelation. In the\r\nstate of nature, every man hath an equal right by honest means to\r\nacquire property, and to enjoy it; in general, to pursue his own\r\nhappiness, and none can consistently controul or interrupt him in the\r\npursuit. But, so turbulent are the passions of some, and so selfish the\r\nfeelings of others, that in such a state, there being no social\r\ncompact, the weak cannot always be protected from the violence of the\r\nstrong, nor the honest and unsuspecting from the arts and intrigues of\r\nthe selfish and cunning. Hence it is easy to conceive, that men,\r\nnaturally formed for society, were inclined to enter into mutual\r\ncompact for the better security of their natural rights. In this state\r\nof society, the unalienable rights of nature are held sacred:--And each\r\nmember is intitled to an equal share of all the social rights. No man\r\ncan of right become possessed of a greater share: If any one usurps it,\r\nhe so far becomes a tyrant; and when he can obtain sufficient strength,\r\nthe people will feel the rod of a tyrant. Or, if this exclusive\r\nprivilege can be supposed to be held in virtue of compact, it argues a\r\nvery capital defect; and the people, when more enlightened, will alter\r\ntheir compact, and extinguish the very idea.\r\n\r\nThese opinions, I conceive to be conformable to the sentiments held up\r\nin our State Constitution. It is therein declared, that Government is\r\ninstituted for the common good; not for the profit, honor or private\r\ninterest of any one man, family, or class of men. And further, all the\r\ninhabitants of this Commonwealth, having such qualifications, as shall\r\nbe established by their Constitution, have an equal right to elect or\r\nbe elected for the public employments.\r\n\r\nBefore the formation of this Constitution, it had been affirmed as a\r\nself evident truth, in the declaration of Independence, very\r\ndeliberately made by the Representatives of the United States of\r\nAmerica in Congress assembled that, \"all men are created equal, and are\r\nendowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights.\" This\r\ndeclaration of Independence was received and ratified by all the States\r\nin the Union, and has never been disannulled. May we not from hence\r\nconclude, that the doctrine of Liberty and Equality is an article in\r\nthe political creed of the United States.\r\n\r\nOur Federal Constitution ordains that, no title of nobility shall be\r\ngranted by the United States. The framers of that Constitution probably\r\nforesaw that such titles, vain and insignificant in themselves, might\r\nbe in time, as they generally, and I believe always have been, the\r\nintroductory to the absurd and unnatural claims of hereditary and\r\nexclusive privileges.\r\n\r\nThe Republic of France have also adopted the same principle, and laid\r\nit as the foundation of their Constitution. That nation having for many\r\nages groaned under the exercise of the pretended right claimed by their\r\nKings and Nobles, until their very feelings as men were become torpid,\r\nat length suddenly awoke, from their long slumber, abolished the\r\nusurpation, and placed every man upon the footing of equal rights. \"All\r\nmen are born free and equal in rights,\" if I mistake not, is their\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\n>From the quotations I have made, I think it appears, that the\r\nConstitutions referred to, different as they may be in forms, agree\r\naltogether in the most essential principles upon which legitimate\r\ngovernments are founded. I have said essential principles, because I\r\nconceive that without Liberty and Equality, there cannot exist that\r\ntranquillity of mind, which results from the assurance of every\r\ncitizen, that his own personal safety and rights are secure:--This, I\r\nthink is a sentiment of the celebrated Montesquieu; and it is the end\r\nand design of all free and lawful Governments. Such assurance,\r\nimpressed upon the heart of each, would lead to the peace, order and\r\nhappiness of all. For I should think, no man, in the exercise of his\r\nreason would be inclined in any instance to trespass upon the equal\r\nrights of citizens, knowing that if he should do it, he would weaken\r\nand risque the security of his own. Even different nations, having\r\ngrounded their respective Constitutions upon the afore-mentioned\r\nprinciples, will shortly feel the happy effects of mutual friendship,\r\nmutual confidence and united strength. Indeed I cannot but be of\r\nopinion, that when those principles shall be rightly understood and\r\nuniversally established, the whole family and brotherhood of man will\r\nthen nearly approach to, if not fully enjoy that state of peace and\r\nprosperity, which ancient Prophets and Sages have foretold.\r\n\r\nI fear I have dwelt too long upon this subject. Another presents itself\r\nto my mind, which I think is indeed great and important; I mean the\r\neducation of our children and youth. Perhaps the minds even of infants\r\nmay receive impressions, good or bad, at an earlier period than many\r\nimagine. It has been observed, that \"education has a greater influence\r\non manners, than human laws can have.\" Human laws excite fears and\r\napprehensions, least crimes committed may be detected and punished: But\r\na virtuous education is calculated to reach and influence the heart,\r\nand to prevent crimes. A very judicious writer, has quoted Plato, who\r\nin shewing what care for the security of States ought to be taken of\r\nthe education of youth, speaks of it as almost sufficient to supply the\r\nplace both of Legislation and Administration. Such an education, which\r\nleads the youth beyond mere outside shew, will impress their minds with\r\na profound reverence of the Deity, universal benevolence, and a warm\r\nattachment and affection towards their country. It will excite in them\r\na just regard to Divine Revelation, which informs them of the original\r\ncharacter and dignity of Man; and it will inspire them with a sense of\r\ntrue honor, which consists in conforming as much as possible, their\r\nprinciples, habits, and manners to that original character. It will\r\nenlarge their powers of mind, and prompt them impartially to search for\r\ntruth in the consideration of every subject that may employ their\r\nthoughts; and among other branches of knowledge, it will instruct them\r\nin the skill of political architecture and jurisprudence; and qualify\r\nthem to discover any error, if there should be such, in the forms and\r\nadministration of Governments, and point out the method of correcting\r\nthem. But I need not press this subject, being persuaded, that this\r\nLegislature from the inclination of their minds, as well as in regard\r\nto the duty enjoined by the Constitution, will cherish \"the interest of\r\nLiterature, the Sciences and all their Seminaries.\"\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens,\r\n\r\nLegislation is within your department; yet the Constitution assigns a\r\npart to be taken by the Governor when Bills, and Resolves intended to\r\noperate as Laws, shall be presented to him, which is, merely to state\r\nobjections if he has any, of which the Legislature will judge and\r\nfinally determine.

In\r\npursuance of the direction of our Constitution, which is expressive of\r\ntheir will, they have again in their anniversary meetings, made their\r\nfree elections of such persons as they have judged meet to administer\r\ntheir public affairs. In this great transaction, they must surely have\r\nfelt their own dignity; and however different their sentiments may have\r\nbeen with regard to the men of their choice, each elector having given\r\nhis suffrage according to the dictates of his own conscience, must\r\nenjoy the consoling reflection of having honestly done his duty. Those\r\nin whom the people have placed their confidence, it is presumed will\r\nfaithfully watch over, and guard their general interests, and take care\r\nthat the liberties and the sovereignty of right belonging to this\r\nCommonwealth, shall suffer no diminution.\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens!\r\n\r\nWe are met at a very critical period--The baneful influence of war in\r\nEurope, has already too far extended itself into this remote region. A\r\nwar of Kings and Nobles, against the equal Rights of Men. Their first\r\nobject was to controul the common right of all civil societies, by\r\nfrustrating the attempt of a magnanimous nation, to establish a\r\nConstitution of government for themselves, according to their own mind:\r\nMore lately the nefarious design has been to crush the new formed\r\nRepublic in its infancy:--But the GOD of Armies, who favors the brave in a\r\nrighteous cause, has hitherto appeared for its protection, and crowned\r\nthe astonishing efforts of its defenders with astonishing victories.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain takes an active part with the mighty combination of\r\nKings. Indeed it does not appear that she has yet made a demand on our\r\nconfederate Republic to join the league. A demand which we are well\r\ninformed she has made upon some of the neutral Republics of Europe.\r\nBut, whilst we have preserved the most strict neutrality towards the\r\nbelligerent powers of Europe, in observance of treaties made under the\r\nauthority of the United States, which are the supreme law of the land,\r\nshe, for the sake of aiding the cause in which she is so deeply\r\nengaged, has employed her naval force in committing depredations on our\r\nlawful and unprotected commerce. Thus in fact, she has commenced\r\nhostilities. The Federal Government, although very solicitous if\r\npossible, to prevent the calamities of war, have meditated measures\r\npreparatory for the event. The papers and communications which I have\r\nreceived on this subject, shall be laid before you.\r\n\r\nIt was a declared intention of the people of the United States, when\r\nthey adopted our present constitution, \"to form a more perfect union\"--an\r\nimportant object indeed. The deliberate voice of the people is commonly\r\nthe voice of reason--the voice of the people ought therefore to be\r\nattended to. Union, formed upon the genuine republican principles and\r\nviews of our political institutions, by combining our strength, will\r\nhave a powerful tendency in a time of war to reduce an unreasonable\r\nenemy to terms of Justice, and the re-establishment of tranquility; and\r\nin peace to secure the blessings of equal liberty to the present and\r\nfuture generations.\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens!\r\n\r\nIt is my sincere and ardent wish, and I have a strong persuasion in my\r\nown mind, that wisdom and public spirit will guide you in all your\r\ndeliberations and decisions. I will endeavor seasonably to dispatch\r\nsuch business as you shall lay before me during this session, and at\r\nall times, to support the true dignity of this Commonwealth in the\r\nstation in which I have the honor of being placed, by a vigilant\r\nattention to its essential duties.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE LEGISLATURE OF MASSACHUSETTS.\r\n\r\nJUNE 4, 1794.\r\n\r\n[Independent Chronicle, June 5, 1794; a text is in the Massachusetts\r\nArchives.]\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE AND\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,\r\n\r\nBy an Act of the Legislature passed on the fourteenth of March, 1785,\r\nintitled \"An Act1 providing a place of confinement for thieves, and\r\nother convicts to hard labor;\" it is provided \"that the Island within\r\nthe harbor of Boston, commonly called Castle-Island, shall be a place\r\nfor the reception, and secure confinement of all such persons as shall\r\nbe sentenced for confinement and hard labor, for the term of their\r\nnatural lives, or for any shorter space pursuant to the laws of the\r\nCommonwealth.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to this, and subsequent laws, a great number of persons have\r\nbeen sentenced to confinement and hard labor; there are a number of\r\nthem at this time under sentences, some for the term of their lives,\r\nand others for a shorter space of time.--There are particular regulations\r\nprovided by the Legislature of the Commonwealth, and particular modes\r\nof discipline instituted for the government of such convicts.\r\n\r\nThis mode of punishment has been found by experience to be of great\r\nutility in the preservation of good order, and the producing of safety\r\nin the Commonwealth, and has a manifest tendency to render unnecessary\r\nthose sanguinary punishments which are too frequently inflicted in\r\nother Governments.\r\n\r\nThe situation of our country now calls for fortifications on our\r\nseacoasts; and the President of the United States has communicated the\r\nAct of Congress for erecting forts in the harbor of Boston, which now\r\nlies before you. The fortification on Castle Island is very ancient,\r\nand has always been supported by this Government. It is a prison for\r\ncertain purposes, by an act of the legislature of the Commonwealth,\r\nwhich puts it out of my power, if I was disposed to do it, to deliver\r\nthe controul over to any other hands. Should that place, by act of the\r\nGeneral Court, be given over to the controul of the military department\r\nof the general Government, the convicts under sentence, must be\r\ndischarged, or another place of confinement be provided for them. No\r\ngovernment can assign the execution of sentences passed by it to the\r\nofficers of another government, because such officers would be under no\r\nobligation to execute the laws of a government of which they are\r\ntotally independent, nor can they be held amenable to it for any\r\nexcesses, or oppressions in their conduct. That fortification being\r\nthus appropriated by the Legislature, and yet being convenient as a\r\nplace of defence, I submit it to you, gentlemen, to determine, whether\r\nit will not be for the interest of the Commonwealth in particular, and\r\nthe United States in general, to have it repaired at the ex-pence of\r\nthis government. The expence will not be great, and the utility, if not\r\nthe indispensible necessity of holding it under the controul of this\r\nstate, in the same manner, and for the same purposes for which it has\r\nbeen held for several years last past, is very obvious.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL ADAMS.\r\n\r\n1 Chapter 32.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 3, 1794.\r\n\r\n[Independent Chronicle, November 6, 1794.]\r\n\r\nBy Authority [Seal] Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nBY THE GOVERNOR.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nIT being provided by the Seventeenth Article of the Treaty of Amity and\r\nCommerce, now subsisting between the United States of America and the\r\nFrench Republic, \"That no shelter or refuge shall be given in the ports\r\nof either of said nations to such as shall have made prize of the\r\nsubjects, people or property of either of the parties; but if such\r\nshall come in, being forced by stress of weather, or the dangers of the\r\nsea, all proper measures shall be vigorously used, that they go out and\r\nretire from thence as soon as possible.\"1 And the Secretary of State\r\nfor the Government of the said United States, having by his letter of\r\nthe 10th of October last, informed me that \"M. Fauchet, the Minister of\r\nthe French Republic, near the United States, apprehends from\r\ncircumstances which have been experienced that unless prompt and\r\ndecisive measures are adopted in the several ports in regard to vessels\r\nhostile to the French Nation, and bringing in French prizes, the branch\r\nbefore recited, of the Treaty, will become null:\" And the said\r\nSecretary having requested that measures may be taken to preserve that\r\nbranch of the Treaty inviolate, by Vessels hostile to the French Nation\r\nreceiving comfort in the out-ports of the Commonwealth:\r\n\r\nI HAVE THEREFORE, in compliance, with the request of the Government of\r\nthe United States, thought fit to issue this Proclamation, requiring\r\nall Officers, Civil and Military, within this Commonwealth, to take all\r\nlegal and proper measures, and to use and practice all diligence, for\r\nthe effectual support of the above recited Article in the said Treaty.\r\n\r\nAND I do hereby enjoin it upon them to prevent any breach thereof, if\r\nsuch should be attempted in any, and especially those ports distant\r\nfrom the Capital, and immediately to give information of the same, with\r\ntheir proceedings thereon, to the Governor and Commander in Chief of\r\nthe Commonwealth, that such further measures may be taken, if any shall\r\nbe necessary, as may be suited to the faith of Nations, and the\r\nsolemnity of National Treaties--And I have reason to expect that the good\r\npeople of the Commonwealth will cheerfully afford their aid in support\r\nof the Laws of the land.\r\n\r\nGiven at Boston, in the said Commonwealth, the third day of November,\r\nin the Year of our Lord, One Thousand Seven Hundred and Ninety-four,\r\nand in the Nineteenth Year of the Independence of the United States of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL ADAMS.\r\n\r\nAttest,\r\n\r\nJOHN AVERY, jun.

If there are any instances wherein the\r\nLaws in being, are inadequate to these great and capital ends, your eye\r\nwill discern the evil, and your wisdom will provide a suitable remedy.\r\nIt shall be my endeavour, as indeed it is my duty, carefully to revise\r\nand readily approve your Bills and Resolves, which may be calculated\r\nfor the public good.\r\n\r\nBy the late returns of the votes for Representatives to serve the\r\nCommonwealth in Congress, there were several districts in which no\r\nchoice had been effected. I immediately issued precepts according to\r\nlaw, requiring the several towns within those Districts to meet on a\r\nday now past, in order to complete their elections. I cannot but\r\nrecommend to your consideration, whether it may not be necessary more\r\neffectually to guard the elections of public agents and officers\r\nagainst illegal practices. All elections ought to be free, and every\r\nqualified elector who feels his own independence as he ought, will act\r\nhis part according to his best, and most enlightened judgment.\r\nElections are the immediate acts of the people's sovereignty, in which\r\nno foreigners should be allowed to intermeddle. Upon free and unbiassed\r\nelections, the purity of the government, and consequently the safety\r\nand welfare of the citizens, may I not say altogether depend.\r\n\r\nIf we continue to be a happy people, that happiness must be assured by\r\nthe enacting and executing of reasonable and wise laws, expressed in\r\nthe plainest language, and by establishing such modes of education as\r\ntend to inculcate in the minds of youth, the feelings and habits of\r\n\"piety, religion and morality,\" and to lead them to the knowledge and\r\nlove of those truly Republican principles upon which our civil\r\ninstitutions are founded. We have solemnly engaged ourselves, fellow\r\ncitizens, to support the Constitution of the United States, and the\r\nConstitution of this Commonwealth. This must be reconcileable in the\r\nmind of any man, who judiciously considers the sovereign rights of the\r\none as limited to federal purposes, and the sovereign rights of the\r\nother, as acting upon and directing the internal concerns of our own\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\nWe have been under apprehensions of being made a party in the\r\ndissolating contest in Europe. Permit me just to observe, that the\r\nfirst and main principle which urged the Combined Powers to enter into\r\nthe contest, is in my own opinion unsupportable by reason and nature,\r\nand in violation of the most essential right of nations and of men. The\r\nrepeated acts of violence which have been committed on the property of\r\nAmerican citizens, might in the opinion of some, have justified\r\nreprisals; but the policy of the Federal Government has directed to\r\nother measures. The wisdom of our own Councils, with the unexampled\r\nsuccesses of our magnanimous Ally, the Republic of France, afford the\r\nstrongest ground of hope, that under the continued smiles of Divine\r\nProvidence, peace and tranquility, so interesting to a rising Republic,\r\nwill in the end be firmly established.\r\n\r\nThe business of fortifying certain harbors within this Commonwealth,\r\naccording to an act of Congress, was left unfinished in your last\r\nsession. It is indeed probable, that the danger which produced that\r\nmeasure, has nearly subsided; but the law still exists, and in my\r\nopinion it cannot be carried into constitutional effect in this\r\nCommonwealth, without the aid of the Legislature of the same. I am led\r\nto this opinion by contemplating the first article of the Constitution\r\nof the United States, which establishes the powers of Congress and\r\nwhich particularly authorises them to exercise exclusive legislation in\r\nall cases whatever, over all places purchased by the consent of the\r\nLegislature of the States, in which the same shall be for the erection\r\nof Forts Magazines, and other public buildings.\r\n\r\nThose who wish to persuade the world to believe, that a free\r\nrepresentative Republic cannot be supported, will no doubt make use of\r\nevery art to injure, and by degrees to alter, and finally to eradicate\r\nthe principles of our free Constitutions: But the virtuous and\r\nenlightened citizens of this Commonwealth, and of all united America,\r\nhave understanding and firmness, sufficient to support those\r\nConstitutions of Civil Government which they have themselves formed,\r\nand which have done them so much honor in the estimation of the world.\r\n\r\nIt is with pain that I mention the insurrection which has lately taken\r\nplace in a sister state.1 It was pointed more immediately at an act of\r\nthe Federal Government. An act of that government, as well as of the\r\ngovernments in the Union, is constitutionally an act of the people, and\r\nour Constitutions provide a safe and easy method to redress any real\r\ngrievances. No people can be more free under a Constitution established\r\nby their own voluntary compact, and exercised by men appointed by their\r\nown frequent suffrages. What excuse then can there be for forcible\r\nopposition to the laws? If any law shall prove oppressive in its\r\noperation, the future deliberations of a freely elective\r\nRepresentative, will afford a constitutional remedy. But the measures\r\nadopted by The President of the United States, supported by the virtue\r\nof citizens of every description, in that, and the adjacent states,\r\nhave prevailed, and there is an end of the insurrection. Let the glory\r\nbe given to Him, who alone governs all events, while we express the\r\njust feelings of respect and gratitude due to all those, whom He\r\nhonours as instruments to carry into effect his gracious designs.\r\n\r\nI congratulate you on the success which the forces of the United\r\nStates, have lately had against the hostile Indians. It is my hearty\r\nwish that by the blessing of Heaven, an end may be put to this\r\nexpensive war, by an agreement between the parties, upon the permanent\r\nprinciples of justice, honor, good neighborhood, & true friendship.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of this Commonwealth, having provided that the General\r\nCourt which shall be in the year of our Lord, one thousand seven\r\nhundred and ninety five, shall issue precepts for collecting the\r\nsentiments of the people in regard to its revision.-- And as this Court is\r\nwithin the year mentioned, you will be pleased to decide, whether it\r\nwas intended by the people that this business should be done by the\r\nGeneral Court which shall be elected within that year, or whether it is\r\nyour duty to attend to it.\r\n\r\nI will lay before you several papers transmitted to me by the Treasurer\r\nand other matters which may occur during the Session by subsequent\r\nmessages.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL ADAMS.\r\n\r\n1 The \"whisky insurrection,\" in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JEREMY BELKNAP.\r\n\r\n[Collections of Massachusetts Historical Society, 1st ser., vol. iv.,\r\np. 83; a draft is in the Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON, March 30, 1795.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI received your note, stating what Dr. Kippis had asserted, respecting\r\na recommendation of Dr. Franklin, minister from America in France, in\r\nthe year 1779, to the American cruisers, to treat Capt. Cook, on his\r\nexpected return from a voyage of discoveries, as a friend, and not an\r\nenemy; assuring them, that in so doing, they would obtain the\r\napprobation of Congress. But that the Doctor was mistaken, for that\r\nassembly, at least the greater part of them, instantly reversed the\r\norder of Dr. Franklin, and directed, that a special order should be\r\ntaken, to seize Capt. Cook, if an opportunity for doing it occurred.\r\n\r\nYou request me to give you a certificate respecting the matter, and to\r\nexpress the years when I was in Congress.--I was a member from the first\r\nsitting of Congress, in the year 1774, until the Spring of the year\r\n1781. It was my constant practice, once in twelve or fifteen months, to\r\nmake a short visit to my constituents. In the year 1779, I was detained\r\nin Boston a much longer time than usual, by a fit of sickness; in which\r\ntime, I constantly received from Mr. Lowell, and my other colleagues,\r\ninformation of the most material transactions of Congress. I do now\r\ndeclare to you, that I do not recollect, either while I was present in\r\nCongress, or from any of my colleagues, while I was absent, that the\r\norders he (Dr. Franklin) had given to the American cruisers were\r\ninstantly or ever reversed, or that it was directed by Congress, that a\r\nspecial order should be taken to seize Capt. Cook, if an opportunity\r\nfor so doing it occurred.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me that Dr. Kippis must have been misinformed. I am, with\r\nrespect, your friend and humble servant,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE LEGISLATURE OF MASSACHUSETTS.\r\n\r\nJUNE 3, 1795.\r\n\r\n[Independent Chronicle, June4, 1795; a text is in the Massachusetts\r\nArchives.]\r\n\r\nFELLOW CITIZENS,\r\n\r\nThe honor which the people have again conferred on me, by a majority of\r\ntheir votes for a Governor of this respectable Commonwealth, while it\r\nexcites the warm feelings of gratitude in my heart, it reminds me of\r\nthe arduous task I am called to undertake, and the many attentions\r\nwhich are requisite for a performance of the great duties of the\r\nstation. Having already been qualified agreeable to the Constitution\r\nand Laws, next to a dependence upon Him who is the Fountain of all\r\nWisdom, I must rely upon your candor, and that of my Fellow Citizens at\r\nlarge.\r\n\r\nThe sovereignty of a nation, always of right, resides in the body of\r\nthe People; and while they have delegated to their freely elected\r\nLegislative, the power of exercising that sovereignty in their behalf,\r\nthe Executive department, as well as the Magistrates who are appointed\r\nto render the Constitution efficient by carrying the laws into effect,\r\nare no less important to the people. For what avails the making of good\r\nand wholesome laws, unless they are duly executed. As the happiness of\r\ncivil society may in a great measure depend upon a wise and a\r\nconsistent harmony between the various branches of the Government; a\r\nfree communication may have a tendency to cultivate and extend the\r\nblessings of friendship and good humor. Indeed our constituents, under\r\nwhose authority and for whose benefit we are to exercise the functions\r\nof our different departments, have a right to expect from us, as their\r\npublic agents, to avow our principles and intentions, and make them\r\nacquainted with the true situation of their public affairs.\r\n\r\nIn the addresses from the Chair, while it was filled by Royal\r\nappointment, uniform attempts were made to strengthen the prerogatives\r\nof the Crown, and to bring the people obsequiously at the foot of the\r\nThrone, for privileges holden by sufferance: Surely it becomes us, in\r\nour happy state of Independence, to turn our attentive minds to the\r\ngreat objects of securing the equal rights of the citizens, and\r\nrendering those constitutions which they have voluntarily established,\r\nrespectable and efficacious.\r\n\r\nOur ancestors, when under the greatest hardships and perils, they\r\nopened to us the wilderness, they took possession of, and left for us\r\nan inheritance, one of the best countries under the sun. Amidst their\r\ntoil, and fatigue they extended their views, and early laid the\r\nfoundation of Civil Liberty. Although they had in prospect, the\r\ninstruction of future youth in all literary science, they considered\r\nmorality and real goodness of heart, as the great basis upon which the\r\nbest interests of a nation could be safely laid. Under this idea, they\r\nalso provided for the institutions of Public Worship, and the support\r\nof teachers in Piety, Religion and Morality. The great increase of our\r\nnumbers & happiness, is a standing witness to the world, of the wisdom\r\nof their measures. Oppressed as they were by the supercilious\r\nhaughtiness of royal prerogative, and considered as a contemptible\r\npeople at a distance from the favors of the Crown, and the flattering\r\nsmiles of courtiers, their perseverance has in effect raised us, by the\r\nblessing of Providence, to an exalted degree of prosperity and glory.\r\n\r\nFellow Citizens, we have a regular exercise of our Federal and State\r\nGovernments; and we owe our unceasing gratitude to the Supreme Ruler of\r\nthe Universe, who safely carried us through our arduous struggle for\r\nfreedom, for which other nations are now contending, at the expence of\r\ntheir blood and treasure. We cannot but rejoice that the principles for\r\nwhich we contended, and which are constitutionally established in\r\nUnited America, are irresistibly spreading themselves through two\r\nmighty nations in Europe. We are now able to embrace those powerful\r\nsister Republics; and what adds much to our joy on this occasion is,\r\nthat those nations became allied to us in an hour, when we were engaged\r\nin our hard conflict with an oppressive tyranny.\r\n\r\nWe ardently wish that the nations of the earth may sheath the sword of\r\nwar, and we as ardently pray, that the equal rights of men may go hand\r\nin hand with peace. If our Federal Government shall with magnanimity\r\nand firmness, support the principles of a free elective Representative\r\nGovernment, and our honour and faith with our allies, and yet maintain\r\npeace with all nations upon the principles of sound policy, and terms\r\nhonourable and safe to our country, it will be an acknowledged\r\napproximation to that perfection in practical politics, which all\r\npeople should most earnestly covet.\r\n\r\nIt is with satisfaction that I have observed the patriotic exertions of\r\nworthy citizens, to establish Academies in various parts of this\r\nCommonwealth. It discovers a zeal highly to be commended. But while it\r\nis acknowledged, that great advantages have been derived from these\r\ninstitutions, perhaps it may be justly apprehended, that multiplying\r\nthem, may have a tendency to injure the ancient and beneficial mode of\r\nEducation in Town Grammar Schools. The peculiar advantage of such\r\nschools is, that the poor and the rich may derive equal benefit from\r\nthem; but none excepting the more wealthy, generally speaking, can\r\navail themselves of the benefits of the Academies. Should these\r\ninstitutions detach the attention and influence of the wealthy, from\r\nthe generous support of town Schools, is it not to be feared that\r\nuseful learning, instruction and social feelings in the early parts of\r\nlife, may cease to be so equally and universally disseminated, as it\r\nhas heretofore been. I have thrown out these hints with a degree of\r\ndiffidence in my own mind. You will take them into your candid\r\nconsideration, if you shall think them worthy of it. In support of the\r\npublic Schools, from whence have flowed so many great benefits, our\r\nUniversity has from its infancy furnished them with well educated and\r\nfit persons to fill the places of Instructors; and they, in return,\r\nhave yearly brought forward fit pupils for the further instruction of\r\nthe University.--The University therefore claims a place among the first\r\nattentions of the public.\r\n\r\nThe citizens of the Commonwealth have lately had before them a question\r\nof the expediency of revising, at this period, the form of our present\r\nConstitution. The conduct of the citizens on this occasion, has given\r\nfull proof, that an enlightened, free and virtuous people, can as a\r\nbody, be the keepers of their own Liberties, and the guardians of their\r\nown rights. On which side soever the question may have been decided, I\r\nhave the pleasure of being informed that it has been discussed with\r\npropriety, calmness and deliberation. If the event should be in favour\r\nof a Convention, a future revision may be made at such period as may be\r\nmost fit and convenient, and there may be opportunity, in the mean\r\ntime, for the citizens at their leisure, to make their own remarks upon\r\nthe Constitution, in its operation, and thus prepare themselves for\r\ncool deliberation, at another revision. Should the determination be\r\notherwise, I think it will clearly follow, that the citizens are happy\r\nunder the present Constitution, and that they feel themselves well\r\nassured, that if there should be a future necessity for it, they can,\r\nin a peaceable and orderly manner, revise, alter and amend it at their\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nA compleat, perfect and permanent system of jurisprudence, is one of\r\nthe greatest blessings which our country can possess. To have justice\r\nadministered promptly and without delay, is to gather the best fruits\r\nof a free and regular Government. Uncorrupted Juries are an effectual\r\nguard against the violations of our rights and property. Having an\r\nExecutive annually elected, and the Legislative elected as often, the\r\none branch of which is the grand inquest of the Commonwealth, and the\r\nother branch to be constituted a Court, as there may be occasion, to\r\ntry and determine upon impeachments, we may be secured against\r\nimpartiality in the fountain, and corruption in the streams of justice.\r\nThe Legislative will examine all the machinery by which the Government\r\nacts: TOO frequent speculative experiments may tend to render the\r\nmotions unsteady, and to annex insecurity to property. Where there are\r\nno radical defects, a long exercise of Judicial Authority, in any\r\nparticular mode, brings the feelings of the people in unison with it,\r\nand fixes habits to which they have been accustomed.\r\n\r\nWhile we expect from our Judges and Magistrates and other civil\r\nofficers that justice be administered with alacrity and impartiality,\r\nshould we not be careful that ample justice be done to them. The\r\nadministration of justice should indeed be without oppressive or\r\nunnecessary expences on the people; but the Ministers of justice should\r\nhave an equitable reward for their services. If therefore from accident\r\nor peculiar or temporary circumstances, the established rewards are\r\ninadequate, I doubt not but you will determine, that what is fit and\r\nproper, will be done. The Executive should be enabled to find men of\r\nsuperior knowledge and integrity, who may be inclined to fill the\r\nimportant places in the Civil Departments, as they shall become vacant.\r\nOn such appointments, the dignity and just authority of the Government\r\nvery materially depends.\r\n\r\nThe Legislative will no doubt continue to guard the public credit, by\r\nadequate provisions for discharging the interest and finally sinking\r\nthe principal of our public debt. The sale of our vacant Lands, and the\r\ndebts due to the Treasury, will contribute to ease the people from too\r\ngreat a burthen of direct taxes. The Treasurer's statements will\r\nascertain the demands necessary for the ensuing year.\r\n\r\nI must intreat you to give me opportunity to revise such Bills and\r\nResolves as you may think proper to lay before me, to which I shall\r\ncheerfully attend, and do all within my power to dispatch the public\r\nbusiness, and render the session agreeable to you, and beneficial to\r\nthe Commonwealth.\r\n\r\nLet us, Fellow Citizens, cultivate a due observance of the Laws which\r\nare constitutionally made by the authority of this Government, as well\r\nas those of the Federal Government, agreeable to the Constitution of\r\nthe United States. Let us transmit our Liberties, our Equal Rights, our\r\nLaws and our free Republican Constitutions, with their various\r\nconcomitant blessings, to those who are coming upon the stage of\r\naction, and hope in God, that they will be handed down, in purity and\r\nenergy, to the latest posterity.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS\r\n\r\nJULY 4, 1795.\r\n\r\n[Independent Chronicle, July 6, 1795.]\r\n\r\nFELLOW CITIZENS,\r\n\r\nThe Representatives of the people in the General Court assembled did\r\nsolemnly Resolve, that an Edifice be erected upon this spot of ground\r\nfor the purpose of holding the Public Council of the Commonwealth of\r\nMassachusetts.

And I do by advice and consent of the Council, appoint\r\nTHURSDAY the Nineteenth day of November next, to be observed as a DAY\r\nof PUBLIC THANKSGIVING and PRAISE throughout this Commonwealth: Calling\r\nupon the Ministers of the Gospel of all Denominations, with their\r\nrespective Congregations to assemble on that Day to offer to God, their\r\nunfained Gratitude, for his great Goodness to the People of the United\r\nStates in general, and of this Commonwealth in particular.\r\n\r\nMore especially in that he hath in his Good Providence united the\r\nseveral States under a National Compact formed by themselves, whereby\r\nthey may defend themselves against external Enemies, and maintain Peace\r\nand Harmony with each other.\r\n\r\nThat internal tranquillity has been continued within this Commonwealth;\r\nand that the voice of Health is so generally heard in the habitations\r\nof the People.\r\n\r\nThat the Earth has yielded her increase, so that the labours of our\r\nindustrious Husbandmen have been abundantly crowned with Plenty.\r\n\r\nThat our Fisheries have been so far prospered.--Our Trade notwithstanding\r\nobstructions it has met with, has yet been profitable to us, and the\r\nworks of our Hands have been established.\r\n\r\nThat while other nations have been involved in War, attended with an\r\nuncommon profusion of Human Blood, we in the course of Divine\r\nProvidence, have been preserved from so grievous a Calamity, and have\r\nenjoyed so great a measure of the Blessing of Peace.\r\n\r\nAnd I do recommend that together with our Thanksgiving, humble Prayer\r\nmay be offered to God, that we may be enabled, by the subsequent\r\nobedience of our Hearts and Manners, to testify the sincerity of our\r\nprofessions of Gratitude, in the sight of God and Man; and thus be\r\nprepared for the Reception of future Divine Blessings.\r\n\r\nThat GOD would be pleased to Guide and Direct the Administration of the\r\nFederal Government, and those of the several States, in Union, so that\r\nthe whole People may continue to be safe and happy in the\r\nConstitutional enjoyment of their Rights, Liberties and Privileges, and\r\nour Governments be greatly respected at Home and Abroad.\r\n\r\nAnd while we rejoice in the Blessing of Health bestowed upon us, we\r\nwould sympathize with those of our Sister States, who are visited with\r\na Contagious and Mortal Disease; and fervently supplicate the FATHER of\r\nMercies that they may speedily be restored to a state of Health and\r\nProsperity.\r\n\r\nThat HE would in HIS abundant Mercy regard our fellow Citizens and\r\nothers, who are groaning under abject Slavery, in Algiers, and direct\r\nthe most effectual measures for their speedy Relief.\r\n\r\nThat HE would graciously be pleased to put an end to all Tyranny and\r\nUsurpation, that the People who are under the Yoke of Oppression, may\r\nbe made free; and that the Nations who are contending for freedom may\r\nstill be secured by HIS Almighty Aid, and enabled under His influence\r\nto complete wise systems of Civil Government, founded in the equal\r\nRights of Men and calculated to establish their permanent Security and\r\nWelfare.\r\n\r\nAnd Finally, that the Peaceful and Glorious Reign of our Divine\r\nRedeemer may be known and enjoyed throughout the whole Family of\r\nMankind.\r\n\r\nAnd I do recommend to the People of this Commonwealth, to abstain from\r\nall such Labour and Recreation, as may not be consistent with the\r\nSolemnity of the said Day.\r\n\r\nGiven at the Council-Chamber, in Boston, the fourteenth Day of October\r\nin the Year of our LORD, One Thousand seven Hundred and Ninety-five,\r\nand in the Twentieth Year of the Independence of the United States of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL ADAMS.\r\n\r\nTrue Copy--Attest,\r\n\r\nJOHN AVERY, jun. Sec'ry.\r\n\r\nGod save the Commonwealth of Massachusetts!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1796\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE LEGISLATURE OF MASSACHUSETTS.\r\n\r\nJANUARY 19, 1796.\r\n\r\n[Independent Chronicle, January 21, 1796, two texts are in the\r\nMassachusetts Archives.]\r\n\r\nFELLOW CITIZENS,\r\n\r\nI CANNOT but congratulate you upon the many blessings which the\r\nbountiful hand of Providence has bestowed upon us since your\r\nadjournment.\r\n\r\nWe with our Fellow Citizens at large have observed a day solemnly to\r\nrecognize these blessings; and if sincere obedience to our gracious\r\nBenefactor, shall accompany the gratitude which we then professed, we\r\nmay humbly rely upon him that he will continue his divine favors to the\r\ncitizens at large, and direct the public councils of our Nation and\r\nCommonwealth to such measures as shall be productive of the safety and\r\nwelfare of all.\r\n\r\nIn my former address to this General Court I mentioned the duty\r\nrequired by the Constitution, frequently to revise the laws, and amend\r\nsuch of them as may still be necessary to secure the lives, liberty and\r\nproperty of the citizens--The importance of civil commutative justice and\r\nthe good policy of making adequate compensations to those who\r\nadminister well --and the great advantages of cherishing the interests of\r\nliterature and the sciences, and all seminaries of them among the body\r\nof the people. Upon these I shall not now enlarge.\r\n\r\nAgriculture and Commerce mutually depend upon each other. As foreign\r\nmarkets are supplied from our fields, it is an object of importance,\r\nthat the transportation of heavy articles, and means of communication\r\nfrom one part of the State to another, may be rendered as easy and\r\ncheap as the nature of the country will admit. By the spirit of\r\nenterprize, which so remarkably animates the citizens, countenanced by\r\nthe Legislature, much has been done and is still doing in various parts\r\nof the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\nThe improvement of Arts and Manufactures is of interesting moment. The\r\nencouragement of such manufactures in particular, as will diminish the\r\nconsumption of Foreign Articles and exhibit a real balance in our\r\nfavor, is the common concern of the whole Union--Such encouragement as\r\nwill spread the spirit of Industry individually through the body of the\r\npeople, will tend to increase their happy feelings of Independence, and\r\ngive them an exalted idea of the truly noble character of Free\r\nCitizens. Industry naturally leads to sobriety of sentiment, rectitude\r\nof manners, a due observance of wise and constitutional laws, and of\r\ncourse to public and private virtue.\r\n\r\nFellow Citizens,\r\n\r\nIT is wisdom often to recur to first principles. The people of this\r\nCommonwealth, as well as those of the United States, have voluntarily\r\nformed such constitutions of government, as they have judged well\r\nadapted to secure their own political safety.--These Constitutions are\r\nfounded upon the same principles; and they avow the great and\r\nfundamental political truth that all power is derived from the people.\r\nAs these and all new forms of Government which recognize principles,\r\nnever reduced to practice until the period of our illustrious\r\nRevolution must be in their nature experiments, the provision of a\r\npeaceable and constitutional remedy for such defects as experience may\r\npoint out, is with great propriety established in our State and\r\nNational Governments.--The citizens of this Commonwealth, have lately\r\ndiscovered their acquiescence under their Constitution as it now\r\nstands. But it still remains recorded in our declaration of rights,\r\nthat the people alone have an incontestible, unalienable and\r\nindefeasible right to institute government; & to reform, alter, or\r\ntotally change the same when their protection, safety, prosperity and\r\nhappiness require it. And the Federal Constitution, according to the\r\nmode prescribed therein has already undergone such amendments in\r\nseveral parts of it, as from experience has been judged necessary.\r\n\r\nThe Government of the United States is entrusted solely with such\r\npowers as regard our safety as a nation; and all powers not given to\r\nCongress by the Constitution remain in the individual States and the\r\npeople. In all good Governments the Legislative, Executive and\r\nJudiciary powers are confined within the limits of their respective\r\nDepartments. If therefore it should be found that the Constitutional\r\nrights of our federal and local Governments should on either side be\r\ninfringed, or that either of the Departments aforesaid should interfere\r\nwith another, it will, if continued, essentially alter the\r\nConstitution, and may in time, I hope far distant, be productive of\r\nsuch convulsions as may shake the political ground upon which we now\r\nhappily stand.\r\n\r\nUnder these impressions, I cannot forbear to mention to you a subject\r\nwhich has lately arrested the public attention and employed the pens of\r\ningenious men of different sentiments concerning it. In discussing a\r\nsubject so exceedingly momentous as a national Treaty, no personal\r\nattachment or prejudice, no private or selfish feelings, no arts of\r\ndeception should be suffered to intermingle: Truth should be the\r\nobject, and reason the guide.\r\n\r\nBy the Constitution of the United States, it is provided, that all\r\nLegislative powers therein granted, shall be vested in a Congress, to\r\nconsist of a Senate and a House of Representatives. These several\r\nbranches have, and exercise a positive negative upon each other: No\r\nLegislative act, therefore, can pass without their joint concurrence.\r\nBut in another part of the Constitution, under the head of Executive,\r\nthe President has the power with the advice and consent of the Senate,\r\nprovided two thirds of the Senate present, concur, to make Treaties;\r\nand all Treaties which are made or shall be made under the authority of\r\nthe United States, shall be among the Supreme Laws of the Land: The\r\nSenate therefore partakes with the Executive, so far as to advise and\r\nconsent; but the most popular branch of Congress has no concern\r\ntherein. I do earnestly recommend to you to turn your attention to\r\nthose parts of the Constitution, at least, which relate to the\r\nLegislative and Executive powers, and judge for yourself, whether they\r\nmay not be construed to militate with each other and lead to an absurd\r\nconclusion--that there actually exists in the Government of the United\r\nStates, two distinct and decisive Legislatives.\r\n\r\nI am far from being desirous that unnecessary alterations of our\r\nConstitution, should be proposed: but it is of great consequence to the\r\nliberties of a nation, to review its civil Constitution and compare the\r\npractice of its administrators with the essential principles upon which\r\nit is founded. We, fellow-citizens, are under the strongest\r\nobligations, from the solemnity of our mutual compacts, and even our\r\nsacred oaths, with a watchful eye at every point to defend and support\r\nour Constitutions; and to strengthen the essential principles upon\r\nwhich they are founded, when it shall be needful, falls in my opinion\r\nwithin those solemn obligations.\r\n\r\nI hope, fellow-citizens, that what I am now about to say will not be\r\ndeemed improper.\r\n\r\nI have been accustomed to speak my mind upon matters of great moment to\r\nour common country with freedom; and every citizen of the United States\r\nhas the same right that I have. I may never hereafter have an\r\nopportunity of publicly expressing my opinion on the Treaty made with\r\nthe Court of London: I am therefore constrained with all due respect to\r\nour Constituted Authority to declare, that the Treaty appears to me to\r\nbe pregnant with evil. It controuls some of the powers specially vested\r\nin Congress for the security of the people; and I fear that it may\r\nrestore to Great Britain such an influence over the Government and\r\npeople of this country as may not be consistent with the general\r\nwelfare. This subject however it is expected will come before the\r\nCongress whose immediate province it is to discuss it, and to\r\ndetermine, so far as it may be in their power, as they shall think, for\r\nthe safety and welfare of the people.\r\n\r\nI shall use my best endeavor to dispatch the business which you shall\r\nlay before me. And it is my cordial wish that all your decisions may\r\ntend to the prosperity of the Commonwealth, and afford to you the most\r\nagreeable reflections.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE LEGISLATURE OF MASSACHUSETTS.\r\n\r\nMAY 31, 1796.\r\n\r\n[Independent Chronicle, June 2, 1796; two texts are in the\r\nMassachusetts Archives.]\r\n\r\nFELLOW CITIZENS,\r\n\r\nIt is not my intention to interrupt your business by a lengthy Address.\r\nI have requested a meeting with you at this time, principally with a\r\nview of familiarizing the several branches of government with each\r\nother, of cultivating harmony in sentiment upon constitutional\r\nprinciples, and cherishing that mutual friendship which always invites\r\na free discussion in matters of important concern.\r\n\r\nThe Union of the States is not less important than that of the several\r\ndepartments of each of them. We have all of us recently laid ourselves\r\nunder a sacred obligation to defend and support our Federal and State\r\nConstitutions: A principal object in the establishment of the former,\r\nas it is expressed in the preamble, was \"to form a more perfect Union:\"\r\nTo preserve this Union entire, and transmit it unbroken to posterity,\r\nis the duty of the People of United America, and it is for their\r\nlasting interest, their public safety and welfare. Let us then be\r\nwatchful for the preservation of the Union, attentive to the\r\nfundamental principles of our free Constitutions, and careful in the\r\napplication of those principles in the formation of our laws, lest that\r\ngreat object which the people had in view in establishing the\r\nindependence of our country, may be imperceptibly lost.\r\n\r\nThe Members of the General Court, coming from all parts of the\r\nCommonwealth, must be well acquainted with the local circumstances and\r\nwants of the citizens; to alleviate and provide for which, it is\r\npresumed you will diligently enquire into the state of the\r\nCommonwealth, and render such Legislative aid as may be found\r\nnecessary, for the promoting of useful improvements, and the\r\nadvancement of those kinds of industry among the people, which\r\ncontribute to their individual happiness, as well as that of the\r\npublic.--Honest industry, tends to the increase of sobriety, temperance\r\nand all the moral and political virtues--I trust also that you will attend\r\nto the general police of the Commonwealth, by revising and making such\r\nlaws and ordinances, conformably to our Constitution, as in your wisdom\r\nyou may think further necessary to secure as far as possible, the\r\nsafety and prosperity of the people at large.\r\n\r\nIt is yours, Fellow Citizens, to legislate, and mine only to revise\r\nyour bills, under limited and qualified powers; and I rejoice, that\r\nthey are thus limited:-- These are features which belong to a free\r\ngovernment alone.\r\n\r\nI do not, I ought not to forget that there are other important duties\r\nconstitutionally attached to the Supreme Executive--I hope I shall be\r\nenabled within my department, with the continued advice of a wise and\r\nfaithful Council, so to act my part, as that a future retrospect of my\r\nconduct may afford me consoling reflections; and that my administration\r\nmay be satisfactory to reasonable and candid men, and finally meet with\r\nthe approbation of God, the Judge of all.--May his wisdom preside in all\r\nour Councils and deliberations, and lead to such decisions as may be\r\nhappily adapted to confirm and perpetuate the public liberty, and\r\nsecure the private and personal rights of the citizens from suffering\r\nany injury.\r\n\r\nI shall further communicate to you by subsequent message as occasion\r\nmay offer.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 6, 1796\r\n\r\n[Independent Chronicle, October 17, 1796.]\r\n\r\nPublished by Authority [Seal] Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nBY THE GOVERNOR.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION FOR A DAY OF PUBLIC THANKSGIVING.\r\n\r\nWHEREAS it has pleased God, the Father of all Mercies, to bestow upon\r\nus innumerable unmerited favours in the course of the year past; it\r\nhighly becomes us duly to recollect his goodness, and in a public and\r\nsolemn manner to express the greatful feelings of our hearts:\r\n\r\nI have therefore thought fit, with the advice and consent of the\r\nCouncil, to appoint THURSDAY the 15th day of December next, to be\r\nobserved as a Day of PUBLIC THANKSGIVING and PRAISE to our Divine\r\nBENEFACTOR throughout this Commonwealth--Calling upon the Ministers of the\r\nGospel, with their respective Congregations, and the whole body of the\r\nPeople, religiously to observe the said Day by celebrating the Praises\r\nof that all-gracious Being, of whose Bounty we have experienced so\r\nlarge a share.\r\n\r\nHe hath prevented Epidemical Diseases from spreading, and afforded us a\r\ngeneral state of Health. He hath regarded our Pastures and Fields with\r\nan Eye of the most indulgent Parent, and rewarded the Industry of our\r\nHusbandmen with a plentiful Harvest.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the unreasonable obstructions to our trade on the seas,\r\nit has generally been prosperous and our fisheries successful.\r\n\r\nOur civil Constitutions of Government, formed by ourselves, and\r\nadministered by Men of our own free Election, are by His Grace\r\ncontinued to us.

That he would still afford his\r\nBlessings on our Trade, Agriculture, Fisheries and all the labours of\r\nour hands. That he would smile upon our University, and all Seminaries\r\nof Learning--That Tyranny and Usurpation may everywhere come to an end--That\r\nthe Nations who are contending for true liberty may still be succeeded\r\nby his Almighty aid--That every Nation and Society of Men may be inspired\r\nwith the knowledge and feeling of their natural and just rights, and\r\nenabled to form such systems of Civil Government as shall be fully\r\nadopted to promote and establish their Social Security and Happiness--And,\r\nfinally, that in the course of God's Holy Providence, the great Family\r\nof Mankind may bow to the sceptre of the Prince of Peace so that mutual\r\nFriendship and Harmony may universally prevail.\r\n\r\nAnd I do recommend to the People of this Commonwealth to abstain from\r\nall such Labours and Recreations as may not be consistent with the\r\nSolemnity of the said Day.\r\n\r\nGiven at the Council Chamber in Boston, this sixth day of October, in\r\nthe year of our Lord, one Thousand seven Hundred and Ninety-six, and in\r\nthe twenty-first Year of the Independence of the United States of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL ADAMS.\r\n\r\nAttest\r\n\r\nJOHN AVERY, Sec'ry\r\n\r\nGOD save the Commonwealth of Massachusetts!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE LEGISLATURE OF MASSACHUSETTS.\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 17,1796.\r\n\r\n[Independent Chronicle, November 21, 1796; two texts are in the\r\nMassachusetts Archives.]\r\n\r\nYou are sensible, Fellow Citizens, that the principal motive which\r\ninduced your adjournment to the 16th current, was to transact the\r\nbusiness prescribed by law, respecting the Electors of a President and\r\nVice-President of the United States of America.\r\n\r\nNot being able to determine in my own mind, whether you would probably\r\nbe inclined to begin the business of a winter session at this season,\r\nor not, I did, by the advice of the Council, appoint a later day for a\r\nPublic Thanksgiving, than has been usual; intending thereby, to afford\r\nyou an opportunity to finish the business above mentioned, and, if you\r\nshould then think it proper, keep the festival in your respective\r\nfamilies. This matter, however, it becomes me to leave to your own\r\ndiscretion.

If upon\r\nfurther deliberation you should be of my opinion, I shall be happy to\r\nconcur with you, in a mode more consonant to the spirit of our\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL ADAMS.\r\n\r\nTO THE LEGISLATURE OF MASSACHUSETTS.\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 24, 1796.\r\n\r\n[Independent Chronicle, November 28, 1796 , a text is in the\r\nMassachusetts Archives, and a draft is in the Samuel Adams Papers,\r\nLenox Library.]\r\n\r\nGentlemen of the Senate,\r\n\r\nand Gentlemen of the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nBY a Message, which I yesterday laid before the Senate, I gave a full,\r\nfree and candid account of my proceedings respecting a Resolve of the\r\ntwo Houses, for filling up vacancies which may possibly happen in the\r\nElectors of President and Vice-President of the United States.\r\n\r\nMy mode of conduct on this occasion, I know is, and I flatter myself,\r\nwill be considered, to be as well the result of an ardent wish to\r\npreserve free, important and secure the Elections of those very\r\nimportant Officers, as a desire to dispatch the business at this\r\njuncture before the Legislature.--I wish to promote the true interest of\r\nmy country--I have no other object in view; and therefore, it can be of no\r\nconsequence to me, in what mode this question is discussed nor in what\r\nform your opinions shall be expressed. I am not, at present, for\r\nsupporting the idea that after the Resolve had been signed by me, and\r\ndelivered to the Secretary, that it was not a formal act of government.\r\nBe that as it may--the question is now properly before the General Court,\r\nand if the Resolve, to which I have made an objection, was, under all\r\nconsiderations an Act of the Government upon my signing the same, the\r\nonly question now is whether it ought to be repealed, and another\r\nprovision made for the same object?\r\n\r\nMy objection to the Resolve, or my reason why it should be repealed,\r\n(if it is one) is, that a delegation by the Legislature to the Electors\r\nappointed by the Citizens in their individual capacity for the Election\r\nof President and Vice President, to fill up vacancies in their own\r\nnumber, by death or resignation, is a dangerous power, and tends to the\r\nestablishing a dangerous Precedent; but should my fellow citizens of\r\nthe Senate and House, think differently from me, while I shall feel\r\nquite contented with your decision, I shall be happy, that I have\r\ncandidly acknowledged an error in signing that Resolve, and yet done,\r\nwith firmness, what has appeared to me as the true interest of the\r\nState of which I am a Member, and of a Nation of which I am a Citizen.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1797\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE LEGISLATURE OF MASSACHUSETTS.\r\n\r\nJANUARY 27, 1797.\r\n\r\n[Independent Chronicle, January 30, 1797; a text is in the\r\nMassachusetts Archives].\r\n\r\nFRIENDS AND FELLOW-CITIZENS,\r\n\r\nSINCE your last adjournment, the President of the United States has\r\nofficially announced to the Legislature of the Union his determination\r\nto retire from the cares of public life.--When a citizen so distinguished\r\nby his country withdraws himself from the Councils of the Nation, and\r\nretires to peaceful repose, it must afford very pleasurable feelings in\r\nhis own mind, to be conscious of the good will of the people towards\r\nhim--how much more consoling must his feelings be, in reflecting that he\r\nhas served them many years with purity of intention and disinterested\r\nzeal. We sincerely wish him tranquility in his retirement and strong\r\nconsolation in the latter stage of life.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the provision in the Constitution, the people have\r\nrecently exercised their own sovereign power in the election of another\r\nPresident. Elections to offices, even in the smallest Corporations, are\r\nand ought to be deemed highly important; of how much more importance is\r\nit, that elections to the highest offices in our extensive Republic,\r\nshould be conducted in a manner and with a spirit becoming a free,\r\nvirtuous and enlightened people, who justly estimate the value of their\r\nsacred rights. In the late elections, the people have turned their\r\nattention to several citizens, who have rendered eminent services to\r\nour federal Commonwealth in exalted stations. Upon which ever of the\r\nCandidates the lot may have fallen, the people have reason to expect,\r\nthat his administration will be strictly conformable to the letter and\r\ntrue intent of the Constitution, that it may long continue to be the\r\nguarantee of our freely elective Republican Government.--On fair and\r\nuncontrouled elections, depend, under God, the whole superstructure of\r\nour government--should corruption ever insert itself in our elections,\r\nthere would be great danger of corruption in our governments.--Although it\r\nis not long since the subject of elections was under the consideration\r\nof the Legislature, and a law passed for the purpose of further\r\nsecurity to the people in the free exercise of this invaluable right;\r\nyet give me leave to suggest for your consideration, whether still\r\nfurther securities may not be provided, so that the rightful electors\r\nmay not be frustrated in their honest intentions. That elections may\r\nnot be contaminated by strangers, or unqualified persons, may it not be\r\nnecessary that every man may be known, as far as possible, when he\r\npresents himself to give his vote; this may be more especially\r\nimportant in our seaports and other populous towns, in which many\r\nforeigners of all sorts frequently reside. I would be far from\r\ndictating to you, but I would submit to your judgment whether,\r\nconsidering the liberality of this country to foreigners, and the\r\nfrequency of their naturalizations, it may not be eligible that such\r\nforeigners should be required when they offer their votes to the\r\nSelectmen of the towns, to produce authentic certificates from the\r\nCourts, by which they were endowed with so high a privilege, as a test\r\nof their citizenship. As Piety, Religion and Morality have a happy\r\ninfluence on the minds of men, in their public as well as private\r\ntransactions, you will not think it unseasonable, although I have\r\nfrequently done it, to bring to your remembrance the great importance\r\nof encouraging our University, town schools, and other seminaries of\r\neducation, that our children and youth while they are engaged in the\r\npursuit of useful science, may have their minds impressed with a strong\r\nsense of the duties they owe to their God, their instructors and each\r\nother, so that when they arrive to a state of manhood, and take a part\r\nin any public transactions, their hearts having been deeply impressed\r\nin the course of their education with the moral feelings--such feelings\r\nmay continue and have their due weight through the whole of their\r\nfuture lives.\r\n\r\nPermit me to call your attention to the subject of the Militia of the\r\nCommonwealth.--A well regulated militia \"held in an exact subordination to\r\nthe civil authority and governed by it,\" is the most safe defence of a\r\nRepublic.--In our Declaration of Rights, which expresses the sentiments of\r\nthe people, the people have a right to keep and bear arms for the\r\ncommon defence. The more generally therefore they are called out to be\r\ndisciplined, the stronger is our security. No man I should think, who\r\npossesses a true republican spirit, would decline to rank with his\r\nfellow-citizens, on the fancied idea of a superiority in circumstances:\r\nThis might tend to introduce fatal distinctions in our country. We can\r\nall remember the time when our militia, far from being disciplined, as\r\nthey are at present, kept a well appointed hostile army for a\r\nconsiderable time confined to the capital; and when they ventured out,\r\nindeed they took possession of the ground they aimed at, yet they\r\nventured to their cost, and never forgot the battle of Bunker Hill. The\r\nsame undisciplined militia under the command and good conduct of\r\nGeneral Washington, continued that army confined in or near the\r\ncapital, until they thought proper to change their position and\r\nretreated with haste to Halifax.--If the Militia of the Commonwealth can\r\nbe made still more effective, I am confident that you will not delay a\r\nmeasure of so great magnitude. I beg leave to refer you to the\r\nseventeenth article in our Declaration of Rights, which respects the\r\ndanger of standing armies in time of peace. I hope we shall ever have\r\nvirtue enough to guard against their introduction.--But may we not hazard\r\nthe safety of our Republic should we ever constitute, under the name of\r\na select militia, a small body to be disciplined in a camp with all the\r\npomp & splendor of a regular army? Would such an institution be likely\r\nto be much less dangerous to our free government and to the morals of\r\nour youth, than if they were actually enlisted for permanent service?\r\nAnd would they not as usual in standing armies feel a distinct interest\r\nfrom that of our fellow-citizens at large? The great principles of our\r\npresent militia system are undoubtedly good, constituting one simple\r\nbody, and embracing so great a proportion of the citizens as will\r\nprevent a separate interest among them, inconsistent with the welfare\r\nof the whole.--Those principles, however, I conceive should equally apply\r\nto all the active citizens, within the age prescribed by law.--All are\r\ndeeply interested in the general security; and where there are no\r\ninvidious exemptions, partial distinctions or privileged bands, every\r\nMan, it is presumed, would pride himself in the right of bearing arms,\r\nand affording his personal appearance in common with his\r\nfellow-citizens. If upon examination you shall find, that the duties\r\nincident to our present system bear harder on one class of citizens,\r\nthan on another, you will undoubtedly endeavour, as far as possible, to\r\nequalize its burthens.\r\n\r\nFRIENDS AND FELLOW-CITIZENS,\r\n\r\nI THINK it a duty incumbent upon me to acquaint you, and our\r\nfellow-citizens at large, that having arrived to a stage of life,\r\nmarked in holy writ, and verified by constant experience, as a time of\r\nlabour and sorrow; it is highly proper both upon my own account, as\r\nwell as that of the public, to decline the future suffrages of my\r\nfellow-citizens for the office I have now the honor to sustain.1 I have\r\nhad this in contemplation near a twelve month past. The infirmities of\r\nage render me an unfit person in my own opinion, and very probably in\r\nthe opinion of others, to continue in this station; and I mention it\r\nnow, that those of the electors who may probably be too warmly attached\r\nto me, may not nullify their own votes by giving them for me. I have\r\nalways been convinced that many others might have been found to fill my\r\nplace with greater advantage to the Commonwealth than is now or ever\r\nhas been in my power.--In the Civil Department during the times of War and\r\nof Peace, I have served her in various stations to the best of my\r\nability, and I hope with general approbation; and I can say with truth,\r\nthat I have not enriched myself in her service.--My warmest thanks are\r\njustly due to my constituents for the confidence they have repeatedly\r\nplaced in me.--When I shall be released from the burthens of my public\r\nstation, I shall not forget my country.-- Her welfare and happiness, her\r\npeace and prosperity, her liberty and independence will always have a\r\ngreat share in the best wishes of my heart.\r\n\r\nI will endeavour to consider the business you may lay before me with\r\nfidelity and dispatch. SAMUEL ADAMS.2\r\n\r\n1 In May, 1797, Adams was succeeded as governor by Increase Sumner.\r\n\r\n2 There are in the Massachusetts Archives additional papers by Adams\r\nwhich have here been omitted, but certain of which may well be noted,\r\nas follows: 1782, October 15, statement as to funds for South Carolina\r\nand Georgia; 1790, May 28, letter accepting office of Lieutenant\r\nGovernor; 1794, February 3, veto message; 1795, February 18, veto\r\nmessage; 1795, June 12, message on the resignation of Major General\r\nLithgow; 1795, June 17, message upon the election of an additional\r\nmajor general; 1795, June 22, message as to suspicious vessel in Boston\r\nHarbor; 1796, February 2, message on petition of Willard Griffith;\r\n1796, February 24, message as to suit on bond of S.

V. Wells, vol. iii., pp. 379-381,\r\ncontains the will of Samuel Adams, dated December 29, 1790, and also a\r\nnumber of letters printed only in part, which have not been used.\r\n\r\nThere have also been omitted a number of relatively unimportant papers,\r\nsuch as a brief committee report of November 30, 1785 (Manuscript\r\nDocuments, 1785, Boston City Clerk's office); a brief letter to\r\nElbridge Gerry, recommending Thomas Melville, February 20, 1789 (Emmet\r\nPapers, Lenox Library); a note of introduction to John Adams, June 18,\r\n1782 (Washburn Papers, Massachusetts Historical Society); two letters\r\nto Thomas McKean, November 7, 1781, and June 7, 1782, and one to\r\nWoodbury Langdon, September 1, 1784 (Library of the Historical Society\r\nof Pennsylvania); a note of introduction to Richard Henry Lee, December\r\n9, 1784 (Lee Papers, American Philosophical Society); and a brief note\r\nto Rochambeau, May, 17, 1794 (Library of Congress). A few original\r\nmanuscripts, such as a letter of November 8, 1784, to John Avery and a\r\nletter of January 22, 1794, to George Clinton, have passed into private\r\nhands at auction sales. Certain manuscripts have been withheld by their\r\nowners; but in most instances the entire text of the same has been\r\navailable, so that it is believed that all the important existing\r\nmaterials of Adams have been comprised in these volumes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nMARCH 20, 1797.\r\n\r\n[Independent Chronicle, March 30, 1797; the text is in W. V. Wells,\r\nLife of Samuel Adams, vol. iii., pp. 365, 366.]\r\n\r\nBy Authority. Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nBY THE GOVERNOR,\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION FOR A DAY OF SOLEMN FASTING AND PRAYER.\r\n\r\nIT having been the invariable practice derived from the days of our\r\nrenowned ancestors, at this season of the year to set apart a Day of\r\nPublic Fasting and Prayer: And the practice appearing to be in itself\r\nproductive, if well improved, of happy effects on the public mind--\r\n\r\nI have therefore thought fit, by & with the advice and consent of the\r\nCouncil, to appoint Thursday, the FOURTH day of May next ensuing, to be\r\nobserved and improved throughout this Commonwealth for the purpose of\r\nPUBLIC FASTING AND PRAYER: Earnestly recommending to the Ministers of\r\nthe Gospel with their respective Congregations then to assemble\r\ntogether and seriously to consider, and with one united voice confess\r\nour past sins and transgressions, with holy resolutions, by the Grace\r\nof God, to turn our feet into the path of His Law-- Humbly beseeching him\r\nto endue us with all the Christian Spirit of Piety, Benevolence and the\r\nLove of our Country; and that in all our public deliberations we may be\r\npossessed of a sacred regard to the fundamental principles of our free\r\nelective civil Constitutions--That we may be preserved from consuming\r\nFires and all other desolating Judgments.\r\n\r\nAnd as at this season the general business of the year commences, it\r\nseems highly proper humbly to implore the divine blessing on our\r\nHusbandry, Trade, and Fishery, and all the labour of our hands--On our\r\nUniversity and Schools of Education--On the Administration of the\r\nGovernment of the United States and of this and the other States of the\r\nUnion --On the foreign relations of the United States; and in a particular\r\nmanner that all misunderstanding between them and a Sister Republic may\r\nbe happily, so adjusted as to prevent an open Rupture, and establish\r\nPeace.\r\n\r\nAnd as it is our duty to extend our wishes to the happiness of the\r\ngreat Family of Man, I concede we cannot better express ourselves than\r\nby humbly supplicating the Supreme Ruler of the World--That the rod of\r\ntyrants may be broken into pieces, and the oppressed made Free--That wars\r\nmay cease in all the Earth, and that the confusions that are and have\r\nbeen among the Nations may be overruled for the promoting and speedily\r\nbringing on that holy and happy period, when the Kingdom of our Lord\r\nand Saviour Jesus Christ may be everywhere established, and all the\r\npeople willingly bow to the Sceptre of Him who is the Prince of Peace.\r\n\r\nAnd I do hereby recommend that all unnecessary labour and recreation\r\nmay be suspended on the said day.\r\n\r\nGiven at the Council Chamber in Boston, this 20th day of March, in the\r\nYear of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and Ninety seven, and in\r\nthe twenty first Year of the Independence of the United States of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL ADAMS.\r\n\r\nAttest, JOHN AVERY, Secretary.\r\n\r\nGOD SAVE THE COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Adams Papers, Quincy.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON April 17th 1797\r\n\r\nSIR\r\n\r\nI am loth to trespass one moment upon your time, which at present must\r\nbe very precious. But I am induced even to offer Mr Wyllys this\r\nrecommendatory Letter to you. He is a native of our Commonwealth, and\r\nlately a traveller in Europe. Tho his travels have been merely on\r\nMercantile Business, he appears to be very intelligent, observing, and\r\nimpartial. He has seen Italy; and conversed among others with Genl\r\nBuonoparte and the Pope. He has visited a number of the Italian States,\r\nalso Algiers and France.--I flatter myself you will be pleased with his\r\nconversation and hope you will find it usefull to you. This is the only\r\nmotive for my addressing a Letter to you at this Time. I congratulate\r\nyou as the first Citizen of the United States--I may add of the World. I\r\nam my dear Sir, notwithstanding I have been otherwise represented in\r\nparty papers.\r\n\r\nYour Old and unvaried Friend,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1801\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n[MS., Library of Congress; a draft is in the Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox\r\nLibrary.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON, April 24th, 1801\r\n\r\nMY VERY DEAR FRIEND\r\n\r\nYour Letter of the 29th of March came duly to my hand. I sincerely\r\ncongratulate our Country on the arrival of the day of Glory which has\r\ncalled you to the first office in the administration of our federal\r\nGovernment. Your warm feeling of friendship must certainly have carried\r\nyou to a higher tone of expression than my utmost merits will bear. If\r\nI have at any time been avoided or frowned upon, your kind ejaculation\r\nin the language of the most perfect friend of Man, surpasses every\r\ninjury. The Storm is now over, and we are in port, and I dare say, the\r\nship will be rigged for her proper service; she must also be well man'd\r\nand very carefully officered. No man can be fit to sustain an office\r\nwho cannot consent to the principles by which he must be governed. With\r\nyou, I hope, we shall once more see harmony restored; but after so\r\nsevere and long a storm, it will take a proportionate time to still the\r\nraging of the waves. The World has been governed by prejudice and\r\npassion, which never can be friendly to truth; and while you nobly\r\nresolve to retain the principles of candour and of justice, resulting\r\nfrom a free elective Representative Government, such as they have been\r\ntaught to hate and despise; you must depend upon being hated yourself,\r\nbecause they hate your principles, not a man of them dare openly to\r\ndespise you; your inaugural speech, to say nothing of your eminent\r\nservices to the acceptance of our Country, will secure you from\r\ncontempt. It may require some time before the great body of our fellow\r\ncitizens will settle in harmony good humour and peace. When deep\r\nprejudices shall be removed in some, the self interestedness of others\r\nshall cease and many honest Men, whose minds for want of better\r\ninformation have been clouded, shall return to the use of their own\r\nunderstanding, the happy and wished for time will come. The Eyes of the\r\npeople have too generally been fast closed from the view of their own\r\nhappiness, such alass has been always the lot of Man! but Providence,\r\nwho rules the World, seems now to be rapidly changing the sentiments of\r\nMankind in Europe and America. May Heaven grant that the principles of\r\nLiberty and virtue, truth and justice may pervade the whole Earth. I\r\nhave a small circle of intimate friends, among whom Doctr Charles\r\nJarvis is one; he is a man of much information and great integrity. I\r\nheartily wish there may be an epistolary correspondence between him and\r\nyou. I should have written this Letter before, had not my faithfull\r\nfriend and amanuensis John Avery, who is your friend as well as mine,\r\nbeen occupied in the business of his office of Secretary of this\r\nCommonwealth, which he attends with great punctuality and integrity. It\r\nis not in my power my dear friend, to give you council; an Old Man is\r\napt to flatter himself, that he stands upon an equal footing with\r\nyounger Men; he indeed cannot help feeling that the powers of his Mind,\r\nas well as his body are weakened; but he relies upon his memory, and\r\nfondly wishes his young friends to think that he can instruct them by\r\nhis Experience, when in all probability he has forgot every trace of\r\nit, that was worth his memory. Be assured, that my esteem for you is as\r\ncordial, if possible, as yours is to me. Though an Old Man cannot\r\nadvise you, he can give you his Blessing. You have devoutly my Blessing\r\nand my Prayers.\r\n\r\nMy dear Mrs. Adams will not suffer me to close this Letter, till I let\r\nyou know, that she recollects the pleasure and entertainment you\r\nafforded us, when you was about to embark for France, and hopes that\r\nyour administration may be happy to yourself and prosperous to our\r\nCountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n[MS., Library of Congress , a draft is in the Samuel Adams Papers,\r\nLenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON Novemr 18th 1801\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND\r\n\r\nDoctr Eustis will be so kind as to deliver you this Letter.--I am\r\npersuaded you will find him a man of a candid and fair Mind and liberal\r\nsentiments.\r\n\r\nI congratulate you on the return of Peace. The War both in America and\r\nEurope was designed by Tyrant Kings to exterminate those rights and\r\nliberties which the Gracious Creator has granted to Man, and to sink\r\nthe happiness resulting therefrom in ruin and oblivion.--Is there not, my\r\nfriend, reason to believe, that the principles of Democratic\r\nRepublicanism are already better understood than they were before; and\r\nthat by the continued efforts of Men of Science and Virtue, they will\r\nextend more and more till the turbulent and destructive Spirit of War\r\nshall cease?--The proud oppressors over the Earth shall be totally broken\r\ndown and those classes of Men who have hitherto been the victims of\r\ntheir rage and cruelty shall perpetually enjoy perfect Peace and Safety\r\ntill time shall be no more.\r\n\r\nI am\r\n\r\nYour cordial friend\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1802\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS PAINE\r\n\r\n[W. V. Wells, Life of Samuel Adams, vol iii , pp 372, 373]\r\n\r\nBOSTON, November 30, 1802.\r\n\r\nSIR,--\r\n\r\nI have frequently with pleasure reflected on your services to my native\r\nand your adopted country. Your Common Sense, and your Crisis,\r\nunquestionably awakened the public mind, and led the people loudly to\r\ncall for a declaration of our national independence. I therefore\r\nesteemed you as a warm friend to the liberty and lasting welfare of the\r\nhuman race. But when I heard you had turned your mind to a defence of\r\ninfidelity, I felt myself much astonished and more grieved, that you\r\nhad attempted a measure so injurious to the feelings and so repugnant\r\nto the true interest of so great a part of the citizens of the United\r\nStates. The people of New England, if you will allow me to use a\r\nScripture phrase, are fast returning to their first love. Will you\r\nexcite among them the spirit of angry controversy at a time when they\r\nare hastening to amity and peace? I am told that some of our newspapers\r\nhave announced your intention to publish an additional pamphlet upon\r\nthe principles of your Age of Reason. Do you think that your pen, or\r\nthe pen of any other man, can unchristianize the mass of our citizens,\r\nor have you hopes of converting a few of them to assist you in so bad a\r\ncause? We ought to think ourselves happy in the enjoyment of opinion,\r\nwithout the danger of persecution by civil or ecclesiastical law. Our\r\nfriend, the President of the United States, has been calumniated for\r\nhis liberal sentiments by men who have attributed that liberality to a\r\nlatent design to promote the cause of infidelity. This, and all other\r\nslanders, have been made without the least shadow of proof. Neither\r\nreligion nor liberty can long subsist in the tumult of altercation, and\r\namidst the noise and violence of faction. Felix qui cautus. Adieu.",
