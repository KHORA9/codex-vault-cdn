Life had made a woman of her long ago, while\r\nthese girls had yet been in short dresses, and now an experience had come\r\nto her which few, if any, of these could ever know. It was of no use for\r\nher to deny to herself that she loved Bob Worthington--loved him with the\r\nfull intensity of the strong nature that was hers. To how many of these\r\ngirls would come such a love? and how many would be called upon to make\r\nsuch a renunciation as hers had been? No wonder she felt out of place\r\namong them, and once more the longing to fly away to Coniston almost\r\novercame her. Jethro would forgive her, she knew, and stretch out his\r\narms to receive her, and understand that some trouble had driven her to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nShe was aroused by some one calling her name--some one whose voice\r\nsounded strangely familiar. Cynthia was perhaps the only person in the\r\nschool that day who did not know that Miss Janet Duncan had entered it.\r\nMiss Sadler certainly knew it, and asked Miss Duncan very particularly\r\nabout her father and mother and even her brother. Miss Sadler knew, even\r\nbefore Janet's unexpected arrival, that Mr. and Mrs. Duncan had come to\r\nBoston after Christmas, and had taken a large house in the Back Bay in\r\norder to be near their son at Harvard. Mrs. Duncan was, in fact, a\r\nBostonian, and more at home there than at any other place.\r\n\r\nMiss Sadler observed with a great deal of astonishment the warm embrace\r\nthat Janet bestowed on Cynthia. The occurrence started in Miss Sadler a\r\ntrain of thought, as a result of which she left the drawing-room where\r\nthese reunions were held, and went into her own private study to write a\r\nnote. This she addressed to Mrs. Alexander Duncan, at a certain number on\r\nBeacon Street, and sent it out to be posted immediately. In the meantime,\r\nJanet Duncan had seated herself on the sofa beside Cynthia, not having\r\nfor an instant ceased to talk to her. Of what use to write a romance,\r\nwhen they unfolded themselves so beautifully in real life! Here was the\r\ncountry girl she had seen in Washington already in a fine way to become\r\nthe princess, and in four months! Janet would not have thought it\r\npossible for any one to change so much in such a time. Cynthia listened,\r\nand wondered what language Miss Duncan would use if she knew how great\r\nand how complete that change had been. Romances, Cynthia thought sadly,\r\nwere one thing to theorize about and quite another thing to endure--and\r\nsmiled at the thought. But Miss Duncan had no use for a heroine without a\r\nheartache.\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable that Miss Janet Duncan may appear with Miss Sally\r\nBroke in another volume. The style of her conversation is known, and\r\nthere is no room to reproduce it here. She, too, had a heart, but she was\r\na young woman given to infatuations, as Cynthia rightly guessed. Cynthia\r\nmust spend many afternoons at her house--lunch with her, drive with her.\r\nFor one omission Cynthia was thankful: she did not mention Bob\r\nWorthington's name. There was the romance under Miss Duncan's nose, and\r\nshe did not see it. It is frequently so with romancers.\r\n\r\nCynthia's impassiveness, her complete poise, had fascinated Miss Duncan\r\nwith the others. Had there been nothing beneath that exterior, Janet\r\nwould never have guessed it, and she would have been quite as happy.\r\nCynthia saw very clearly that Mr. Worthington or no other man or woman\r\ncould force Bob to marry Janet.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, in such intervals as her studies permitted, Janet\r\ncontinued her attentions to Cynthia. That same morning she had brought a\r\nnote from her father to Miss Sadler, of the contents of which Janet knew\r\nnothing. Miss Sadler retired into her study to read it, and two newspaper\r\nclippings fell out of it under the paper-cutter. This was the note:--\r\n\r\n   \"My DEAR MISS SADLER:\r\n\r\n   \"Mrs. Duncan has referred your note to me, and I enclose two\r\n   clippings which speak for themselves. Miss Wetherell, I believe,\r\n   stands in the relation of ward to the person to whom they refer, and\r\n   her father was a sort of political assistant to this person.\r\n   Although, as you say, we are from that part of the country (Miss\r\n   Sadler bad spoken of the Duncans as the people of importance there),\r\n   it was by the merest accident that Miss Wetherell's connection with\r\n   this Jethro Bass was brought to my notice.\r\n\r\n   \"Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n   \"ALEXANDER DUNCAN.\"\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant to know that there were people in the world who could snub\r\nMiss Sadler; and there could be no doubt, from the manner in which she\r\nlaid the letter down and took up the clippings, that Miss Sadler felt\r\nsnubbed: equally, there could be no doubt that the revenge would fall on\r\nother shoulders than Mr. Duncan's. And when Miss Sadler proceeded to read\r\nthe clippings, her hair would have stood on end with horror had it not\r\nbeen so efficiently plastered down. Miss Sadler seized her pen, and began\r\na letter to Mrs. Merrill. Miss Sadler's knowledge of the\r\nproprieties--together with other qualifications--had made her school what\r\nit was. No Cynthia Wetherells had ever before entered its sacred portals,\r\nor should again.\r\n\r\nThe first of these clippings was the article containing the arraignment\r\nof Jethro Bass which Mr. Merrill had shown to his wife, and which had\r\nbeen the excuse for Miss Penniman's call. The second was one which Mr.\r\nDuncan had clipped from the Newcastle Guardian of the day before, and\r\ngave, from Mr. Worthington's side, a very graphic account of the conflict\r\nwhich was to tear the state asunder. The railroads were tired of paying\r\ntoll to the chief of a band of thieves and cutthroats, to a man who had\r\nlong throttled the state which had nourished him, to--in short,--to\r\nJethro Bass. Miss Sadler was not much interested in the figures and\r\nmetaphors of political compositions. Right had found a champion--the\r\narticle continued--in Mr. Isaac D. Worthington of Brampton, president of\r\nthe Truro Road and owner of large holdings elsewhere. Mr. Worthington,\r\nbacked by other respectable property interests, would fight this monster\r\nof iniquity to the death, and release the state from his thraldom. Jethro\r\nBass, the article alleged, was already about his abominable work--had\r\nlong been so--as in mockery of that very vigilance which is said to be\r\nthe price of liberty. His agents were busy in every town of the state,\r\nseeing to it that the slaves of Jethro Bass should be sent to the next\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\nAnd what was this system which he had built up among these rural\r\ncommunities? It might aptly be called the System of Mortgages. The\r\nmortgage--dread name for a dreadful thing--was the chief weapon of the\r\nmonster. Even as Jethro Bass held the mortgages of Coniston and Tarleton\r\nand round about, so his lieutenants held mortgages in every town and\r\nhamlet of the state, What was a poor farmer to do--? His choice was not\r\nbetween right and wrong, but between a roof over the heads of his wife\r\nand children and no roof. He must vote for the candidate of Jethro Bass\r\nend corruption or become a homeless wanderer. How the gentleman and his\r\nother respectable backers were to fight the system the article did not\r\nsay. Were they to buy up all the mortgages? As a matter of fact, they\r\nintended to buy up enough of these to count, but to mention this would be\r\nto betray the methods of Mr. Worthington's reform. The first bitter\r\nfrontier fighting between the advance cohorts of the new giant and the\r\nold--the struggle for the caucuses and the polls--had begun. Miss Sadler\r\ncared but little and understood less of all this matter. She lingered\r\nover the sentences which described Jethro Bass as a monster of iniquity,\r\nas a pariah with whom decent men would have no intercourse, and in the\r\nheat of her passion that one who had touched him had gained admittance to\r\nthe most exclusive school for young ladies in the country she wrote a\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nMiss Sadler wrote the letter, and three hours later tore it up and wrote\r\nanother and more diplomatic one. Mrs. Merrill, though not by any means of\r\nthe same importance as Mrs. Duncan, was not a person to be wantonly\r\noffended, and might--knowing nothing about the monster--in the goodness\r\nof her heart have taken the girl into her house. Had it been otherwise,\r\nsurely Mrs. Merrill would not have had the effrontery! She would give\r\nMrs. Merrill a chance. The bell of release from studies was ringing as\r\nshe finished this second letter, and Miss Sadler in her haste forgot to\r\nenclose the clippings. She ran out in time to intercept Susan Merrill at\r\nthe door, and to press into her hands the clippings and the note, with a\r\nrequest to take both to her mother.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Duncans dined in the evening, the Merrills had dinner at\r\nhalf-past one in the afternoon, when the girls returned from school. Mr.\r\nMerrill usually came home, but he had gone off somewhere for this\r\nparticular day, and Mrs. Merrill had a sewing circle. The girls sat down\r\nto dinner alone. When they got up from the table, Susan suddenly\r\nremembered the note which she had left in her coat pocket. She drew out\r\nthe clippings with it.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder what Miss Sadler is sending mamma clippings for,\" she said.\r\n\"Why, Cynthia, they're about your uncle. Look!\"\r\n\r\nAnd she handed over the article headed \"Jethro Bass.\" Jane, who had\r\nquicker intuitions than her sister, would have snatched it from Cynthia's\r\nhand, and it was a long time before Susan forgave herself for her folly.\r\nThus Miss Sadler had her revenge.\r\n\r\nIt is often mercifully ordained that the mightiest blows of misfortune\r\nare tempered for us. During the winter evenings in Coniston, Cynthia had\r\nread little newspaper attacks on Jethro, and scorned them as the cowardly\r\ndevices of enemies. They had been, indeed, but guarded and covert\r\nallusions--grimaces from a safe distance. Cynthia's first sensation as\r\nshe read was anger--anger so intense as to send all the blood in her body\r\nrushing to her head. But what was this? \"Right had found a champion at\r\nlast\" in--in Isaac D. Worthington! That was the first blow, and none but\r\nCynthia knew the weight of it. It sank but slowly into her consciousness,\r\nand slowly the blood left her face, slowly but surely: left it at length\r\nas white as the lace curtain of the window which she clutched in her\r\ndistress. Words which somebody had spoken were ringing in her ears.\r\nWhatever happens! \"Whatever happens I will never desert you, never deny\r\nyou, as long as I live.\" This, then, was what he had meant by newspapers,\r\nand why he had come to her!\r\n\r\nThe sisters, watching her, cried out in dismay. There was no need to tell\r\nthem that they were looking on at a tragedy, and all the love and\r\nsympathy in their hearts went out to her.\r\n\r\n\"Cynthia! Cynthia! What is it?\" cried Susan, who, thinking she would\r\nfaint, seized her in her arms. \"What have I done?\"\r\n\r\nCynthia did not faint, being made of sterner substance. Gently, but with\r\nthat inexorable instinct of her kind which compels them to look for\r\nreliance within themselves even in the direst of extremities, Cynthia\r\nreleased herself from Susan's embrace and put a hand to her forehead.\r\n\r\n\"Will you leave me here a little while--alone?\" she said.\r\n\r\nIt was Jane now who drew Susan out and shut the door of the parlor after\r\nthem. In utter misery they waited on the stairs while Cynthia fought out\r\nher battle for herself.\r\n\r\nWhen they were gone she sank down into the big chair under the reading\r\nlamp--the very chair in which he had sat only two nights before. She saw\r\nnow with a terrible clearness the thing which for so long had been but a\r\nvague premonition of disaster, and for a while she forgot the clippings.\r\nAnd when after a space the touch of them in her hand brought them back to\r\nher remembrance, she lacked the courage to read them through. But not for\r\nlong. Suddenly her fear of them gave place to a consuming hatred of the\r\nman who had inspired these articles: of Isaac D. Worthington, for she\r\nknew that he must have inspired them. And then she began again to read\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nTruth, though it come perverted from the mouth of an enemy, has in itself\r\na note to which the soul responds, let the mind deny as vehemently as it\r\nwill. Cynthia read, and as she read her body was shaken with sobs, though\r\nthe tears came not. Could it be true? Could the least particle of the\r\nleast of these fearful insinuations be true? Oh, the treason of those\r\nwhispers in a voice that was surely not her own, and yet which she could\r\nnot hush! Was it possible that such things could be printed about one\r\nwhom she had admired and respected above all men--nay, whom she had so\r\npassionately adored from childhood? A monster of iniquity, a pariah! The\r\ncruel, bitter calumny of those names! Cynthia thought of his goodness and\r\nloving kindness and his charity to her and to many others. His charity!\r\nThe dreaded voice repeated that word, and sent a thought that struck\r\nterror into her heart: Whence had come the substance of that charity?\r\nThen came another word--mortgage. There it was on the paper, and at sight\r\nof it there leaped out of her memory a golden-green poplar shimmering\r\nagainst the sky and the distant blue billows of mountains in the west.\r\nShe heard the high-pitched voice of a woman speaking the word, and even\r\nthen it had had a hateful sound, and she heard herself asking, \"Uncle\r\nJethro, what is a mortgage?\" He had struck his horse with the whip.\r\n\r\nLoyal though the girl was, the whispers would not hush, nor the doubts\r\ncease to assail her. What if ever so small a portion of this were true?\r\nCould the whole of this hideous structure, tier resting upon tier, have\r\nbeen reared without something of a foundation? Fiercely though she told\r\nherself she would believe none of it, fiercely though she hated Mr.\r\nWorthington, fervently though she repeated aloud that her love for Jethro\r\nand her faith in him had not changed, the doubts remained. Yet they\r\nremained unacknowledged.\r\n\r\nAn hour passed. It was a thing beyond belief that one hour could have\r\nheld such a store of agony. An hour passed, and Cynthia came dry-eyed\r\nfrom the parlor. Susan and Jane, waiting to give her comfort when she was\r\nrecovered a little from this unknown but overwhelming affliction, were\r\nfain to stand mute when they saw her to pay a silent deference to one\r\nwhom sorrow had lifted far above them and transfigured. That was the look\r\non Cynthia's face. She went up the stairs, and they stood in the hall not\r\nknowing what to do, whispering in awe-struck voices. They were still\r\nthere when Cynthia came down again, dressed for the street. Jane seized\r\nher by the hand.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going, Cynthia?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"I shall be back by five,\" said Cynthia.\r\n\r\nShe went up the hill, and across to old Louisburg Square, and up the hill\r\nagain. The weather had cleared, the violet-paned windows caught the\r\nslanting sunlight and flung it back across the piles of snow. It was a\r\nday for wedding-bells. At last Cynthia came to a queerly fashioned little\r\ngreen door that seemed all askew with the slanting street, and rang the\r\nbell, and in another moment was standing on the threshold of Miss\r\nLucretia Penniman's little sitting room. To Miss Lucretia, at her writing\r\ntable, one glance was sufficient. She rose quickly to meet the girl,\r\nkissed her unresponsive cheek, and led her to a chair. Miss Lucretia was\r\nnever one to beat about the bush, even in the gravest crisis.\r\n\r\n\"You have read the articles,\" she said.\r\n\r\nRead them! During her walk hither Cynthia had been incapable of thought,\r\nbut the epithets and arraignments and accusations, the sentences and\r\nparagraphs, wars printed now, upon her brain, never, she believed, to be\r\neffaced. Every step of the way she had been unconsciously repeating them.\r\n\r\n\"Have you read them?\" asked Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my dear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has everybody read them?\" Did the whole world, then, know of her shame?\r\n\r\n\"I am glad you came to me, my dear,\" said Miss Lucretia, taking her hand.\r\n\"Have you talked of this to any one else?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Cynthia, simply.\r\n\r\nMiss Lucretia was puzzled. She had not looked for apathy, but she did not\r\nknow all of Cynthia's troubles. She wondered whether she had misjudged\r\nthe girl, and was misled by her attitude.\r\n\r\n\"Cynthia,\" she said, with a briskness meant to hide emotion for Miss\r\nLucretia had emotions, \"I am a lonely old woman, getting too old, indeed,\r\nto finish the task of my life. I went to see Mrs. Merrill the other day\r\nto ask her if she would let you come and live with me. Will you?\"\r\n\r\nCynthia shook her head.\r\n\r\n\"No, Miss Lucretia, I cannot,\" she answered.\r\n\r\n\"I won't press it on you now,\" said Miss Lucretia.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot, Miss Lucretia. I'm going to Coniston.\"\r\n\r\n\"Going to Coniston!\" exclaimed Miss Lucretia.\r\n\r\nThe name of that place--magic name, once so replete with visions of\r\nhappiness and content--seemed to recall Cynthia's spirit from its flight.\r\nYes, the spirit was there, for it flashed in her eyes as she turned and\r\nlooked into Miss Lucretia's face.\r\n\r\n\"Are these the articles you read?\" she asked; taking the clippings from\r\nher muff.\r\n\r\nMiss Lucretia put on her spectacles.\r\n\r\n\"I have seen both of them,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"And do you believe what they say about--about Jethro Bass?\"\r\n\r\nPoor Miss Lucretia! For once in her life she was at a loss. She, too,\r\npaid a deference to that face, young as it was. She had robbed herself of\r\nsleep trying to make up her mind what she would say upon such an occasion\r\nif it came. A wonderful virgin faith had to be shattered, and was she to\r\nbe the executioner? She loved the girl with that strange, intense\r\naffection which sometimes comes to the elderly and the lonely, and she\r\nhad prayed that this cup might pass from her. Was it possible that it was\r\nher own voice using very much the same words for which she had rebuked\r\nMrs. Merrill?\r\n\r\n\"Cynthia,\" she said, \"those articles were written by politicians, in a\r\npolitical controversy. No such articles can ever be taken literally.\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Lucretia, do you believe what it says about Jethro Bass?\" repeated\r\nCynthia.\r\n\r\nHow was she to avoid those eyes? They pierced into, her soul, even as her\r\nown had pierced into Mrs. Merrill's. Oh, Miss Lucretia, who pride\r\nyourself on your plain speaking, that you should be caught quibbling!\r\nMiss Lucretia blushed for the first time in many, years, and into her\r\nface came the light of battle.\r\n\r\n\"I am a coward, my dear. I deserve your rebuke. To the best of my\r\nknowledge and belief, and so far as I can judge from the inquiries I have\r\nundertaken, Jethro Bass has made his living and gained and held his power\r\nby the methods described in those articles.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Lucretia took off her spectacles and wiped them. She had committed a\r\nfine act of courage.\r\n\r\nCynthia stood up.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" she said, \"that is what I wanted to know.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--\" cried Miss Lucretia, in amazement and apprehension, \"but what are\r\nyou going to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am going to Coniston,\" said Cynthia, \"to ask him if those things are\r\ntrue.\"\r\n\r\n\"To ask him!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. If he tells me they are true, then I shall believe them.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he tells you?\" Miss Lucretia gasped. Here was a courage of which she\r\nhad not reckoned. \"Do you think he will tell you?\"\r\n\r\n\"He will tell me, and I shall believe him, Miss Lucretia.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a remarkable girl, Cynthia,\" said Miss Lucretia, involuntarily.\r\nThen she paused for a moment. \"Suppose he tells you they are true? You\r\nsurely can't live with him again, Cynthia.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you suppose I am going to desert him, Miss Lucretia?\" she asked. \"He\r\nloves me, and--and I love him.\" This was the first time her voice had\r\nfaltered. \"He kept my father from want and poverty, and he has brought me\r\nup as a daughter. If his life has been as you say, I shall make my own\r\nliving!\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\" demanded Miss Lucretia, the practical part of her coming\r\nuppermost.\r\n\r\n\"I shall teach school. I believe I can get a position, in a place where I\r\ncan see him often. I can break his heart, Miss Lucretia, I--I can bring\r\nsadness to myself, but I will not desert him.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Lucretia stared at her for a moment, not knowing what to say or do.\r\nShe perceived that the girl had a spirit as strong as her own: that her\r\nplans were formed, her mind made up, and that no arguments could change\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"Why did you come to me?\" she asked irrelevantly.\r\n\r\n\"Because I thought that you would have read the articles, and I knew if\r\nyou had, you would have taken the trouble to inform yourself of the\r\nworld's opinion.\"\r\n\r\nAgain Miss Lucretia stared at her.\r\n\r\n\"I will go to Coniston with you,\" she said, \"at least as far as\r\nBrampton.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia's face softened a little at the words.\r\n\r\n\"I would rather go alone, Miss Lucretia,\" she answered gently, but with\r\nthe same firmness. \"I--I am very grateful to you for your kindness to me\r\nin Boston. I shall not forget it--or you. Good-by, Miss Lucretia.\"\r\n\r\nBut Miss Lucretia, sobbing openly, gathered the girl in her arms and\r\npressed her. Age was coming on her indeed, that she should show such\r\nweakness. For a long time she could not trust herself to speak, and then\r\nher words were broken. Cynthia must come to her at the first sign of\r\ndoubt or trouble: this, Miss Lucretia's house, was to be a refuge in any\r\nstorm that life might send--and Miss Lucretia's heart. Cynthia promised,\r\nand when she went out at last through the little door her own tears were\r\nfalling, for she loved Miss Lucretia.\r\n\r\nCynthia was going to Coniston. That journey was as fixed, as inevitable,\r\nas things mortal can be. She would go to Coniston unless she perished on\r\nthe way. No loving entreaties, no fears of Mrs. Merrill or her daughters,\r\nwere of any avail. Mrs. Merrill too, was awed by the vastness of the\r\ngirl's sorrow, and wondered if her own nature were small by comparison.\r\nShe had wept, to be sure, at her husband's confession, and lain awake\r\nover it in the night watches, and thought of the early days of their\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nAnd then, Mrs. Merrill told herself, Cynthia would have to talk with Mr.\r\nMerrill. How was he to come unscathed out of that? There was pain and\r\nbitterness in that thought, and almost resentment against Cynthia,\r\nquivering though she was with sympathy for the girl. For Mrs. Merrill,\r\nthough the canker remained, had already pardoned her husband and had\r\nasked the forgiveness of God for that pardon. On other occasions, in\r\nother crisis, she had waited and watched for him in the parlor window,\r\nand to-night she was at the door before his key was in the lock, while he\r\nwas still stamping the snow from his boots. She drew him into the room\r\nand told him what had happened.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Stephen,\" she cried, \"what are you going to say to her?\"\r\n\r\nWhat, indeed? His wife had sorrowed, but she had known the obstacles and\r\nperils by which he had been beset. But what was he to say to Cynthia? Her\r\nvery name had grown upon him, middle-aged man of affairs though he was,\r\nuntil the thought of it summoned up in his mind a figure of purity, and\r\nof the strength which was from purity. He would not have believed it\r\npossible that the country girl whom they had taken into their house three\r\nmonths before should have wrought such an influence over them all.\r\n\r\nEven in the first hour of her sorrow which she had spent that afternoon\r\nin the parlor, Cynthia had thought of Mr. Merrill. He could tell her\r\nwhether those accusations were true or false, for he was a friend of\r\nJethro's. Her natural impulse--the primeval one of a creature which is\r\nhurt--had been to hide herself; to fly to her own room, and perhaps by\r\nnightfall the courage would come to her to ask him the terrible\r\nquestions. He was a friend of Jethro's. An illuminating flash revealed to\r\nher the meaning of that friendship--if the accusations were true. It was\r\nthen she had thought of Miss Lucretia Penniman, and somehow she had found\r\nthe courage to face the sunlight and go to her. She would spare Mr.\r\nMerrill.\r\n\r\nBut had she spared him? Sadly the family sat down to supper without her,\r\nand after supper Mr. Merrill sent a message to his club that he could not\r\nattend a committee meeting there that evening. He sat with his wife in\r\nthe little writing room, he pretending to read and she pretending to sew,\r\nuntil the silence grew too oppressive, and they spoke of the matter that\r\nwas in their hearts. It was one of the bitterest evenings in Mr.\r\nMerrill's life, and there is no need to linger on it. They talked\r\nearnestly of Cynthia, and of her future. But they both knew why she did\r\nnot come down to them.\r\n\r\n\"So she is really going to Coniston,\" said Mr. Merrill.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Mrs. Merrill, \"and I think she is doing right, Stephen.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Merrill groaned. His wife rose and put her hand on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Stephen,\" she said gently, \"you will see her in the morning.\r\n\r\n\"I will go to Coniston with her,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Mrs. Merrily \"she wants to go alone. And I believe it is\r\nbest that she should.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nGreat afflictions generally bring in their train a host of smaller\r\nsorrows, each with its own little pang. One of these sorrows had been the\r\nparting with the Merrill family. Under any circumstance it was not easy\r\nfor Cynthia to express her feelings, and now she had found it very\r\ndifficult to speak of the gratitude and affection which she felt. But\r\nthey understood--dear, good people that they were: no eloquence was\r\nneeded with them. The ordeal of breakfast over, and the tearful \"God\r\nbless you, Miss Cynthia,\" of Ellen the parlor-maid, the whole family had\r\ngone with her to the station. For Susan and Jane had spent their last day\r\nat Miss Sadler's school.\r\n\r\nMr. Merrill had sent for the conductor and bidden him take care of Miss\r\nWetherell, and recommend her in his name to a conductor on the Truro\r\nRoad. The man took off his cap to Mr. Merrill and called him by name and\r\npromised. It was a dark day, and long after the train had pulled out\r\nCynthia remembered the tearful faces of the family standing on the damp\r\nplatform of the station. As they fled northward through the flat\r\nriver-meadows, the conductor would have liked to talk to her of Mr.\r\nMerrill; there were few employees on any railroad who did not know the\r\ngenial and kindly president of the Grand Gulf and sympathize with his\r\ntroubles. But there was a look on the girl's face that forbade intrusion.\r\nPassengers stared at her covertly, as though fascinated by that look, and\r\nsome tried to fathom it. But her eyes were firmly fixed upon a point far\r\nbeyond their vision. The car stopped many times, and flew on again, but\r\nnothing seemed to break her absorption.\r\n\r\nAt last she was aroused by the touch of the conductor on her sleeve. The\r\npeople were beginning to file out of the car, and the train was under the\r\nshadow of the snow-covered sheds in the station of the state capital.\r\nCynthia recognized the place, though it was cold and bare and very\r\ndifferent in appearance from what it had been on the summer's evening\r\nwhen she had come into it with her father. That, in effect, had been her\r\nfirst glimpse of the world, and well she recalled the thrill it had given\r\nher. The joy of such things was gone now, the rapture of holidays and new\r\nsights. These were over, so she told herself. Sorrow had quenched the\r\nthrills forever.\r\n\r\nThe kind conductor led her to the eating room, and when she would not eat\r\nhis concern drew greater than ever. He took a strange interest in this\r\nyoung lady who had such a face and such eyes. He pointed her out to his\r\nfriend the Truro conductor, and gave him some sandwiches and fruit which\r\nhe himself had bought, with instructions to press them on her during the\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nCynthia could not eat. She hated this place, with its memories. Hated it,\r\ntoo, as a mart where men were bought and sold, for the wording of those\r\narticles ran in her head as though some priest of evil were chanting them\r\nin her ears. She did not remember then the sweeter aspect of the old\r\ntown, its pretty homes set among their shaded gardens--homes full of good\r\nand kindly people. State House affairs were far removed from most of\r\nthese, and the sickness and corruption of the body politic. And this\r\npolitical corruption, had she known it, was no worse than that of the\r\nother states in the wide Union: not so bad, indeed, as many, though this\r\nwas small comfort. No comfort at all to Cynthia, who did not think of it.\r\n\r\nAfter a while she rose and followed the new conductor to the Truro train,\r\nglad to leave the capital behind her. She was going to the hills--to the\r\nmountains. They, in truth, could not change, though the seasons passed\r\nover them, hot and cold, wet and dry. They were immutable in their\r\ngoodness. Presently she saw them, the lower ones: the waters of the\r\nlittle stream beside her broke the black bonds of ice and raced over the\r\nrapids; the engine was puffing and groaning on the grade. Then the sun\r\ncrept out, slowly, from the indefinable margin of vapor that hung massed\r\nover the low country.\r\n\r\nYes, she had come to the hills. Up and up climbed the train, through the\r\nlittle white villages in the valley nooks, banked with whiter snow;\r\nthrough the narrow gorges,--sometimes hanging over them,--under steep\r\ngranite walls seared with ice-filled cracks, their brows hung with\r\nicicles.\r\n\r\nTruro Pass is not so high as the Brenner, but it has a grand, wild look\r\nin winter, remote as it is from the haunts of men. A fitting refuge, it\r\nmight be, for a great spirit heavy with the sins of the world below. Such\r\na place might have been chosen, in the olden time, for a monastery--a\r\ngray fastness built against the black forest over the crag looking down\r\nupon the green clumps of spruces against the snow. Some vague longing for\r\nsuch a refuge was in Cynthia's heart as she gazed upon that silent place,\r\nand then the waters had already begun to run westward--the waters of\r\nTumble Down brook, which flowed into Coniston Water above Brampton. The\r\nsun still had more than two hours to go on its journey to the hill crests\r\nwhen the train pulled into Brampton station. There were but a few people\r\non the platform, but the first face she saw as she stepped from the car\r\nwas Lem Hallowell's. It was a very red face, as we know, and its owner\r\nwas standing in front of the Coniston stage, on runners now. He stared at\r\nher for an instant, and no wonder, and then he ran forward with\r\noutstretched hands.\r\n\r\n\"Cynthy--Cynthy Wetherell!\" he cried. \"Great Godfrey!\"\r\n\r\nHe got so far, he seized her hands, and then he stopped, not knowing why.\r\nThere were many more ejaculations and welcomes and what not on the end of\r\nhis tongue. It was not that she had become a lady--a lady of a type he\r\nhad never before seen. He meant to say that, too, in his own way, but he\r\ncouldn't. And that transformation would have bothered Lem but little.\r\nWhat was the change, then? Why was he in awe of her--he, Lem Hallowell,\r\nwho had never been in awe of any one? He shook his head, as though openly\r\nconfessing his inability to answer that question. He wanted to ask\r\nothers, but they would not come.\r\n\r\n\"Lem,\" she said, \"I am so glad you are here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Climb right in, Cynthy. I'll get the trunk.\" There it lay, the little\r\nrawhide one before him on the boards, and he picked it up in his bare\r\nhands as though it had been a paper parcel. It was a peculiarity of the\r\nstage driver that he never wore gloves, even in winter, so remarkable was\r\nthe circulation of his blood. After the trunk he deposited, apparently\r\nwith equal ease, various barrels and boxes, and then he jumped in beside\r\nCynthia, and they drove down familiar Brampton Street, as wide as a wide\r\nriver; past the meeting-house with the terraced steeple; past the\r\npostoffice,--Cousin Ephraim's postoffice,--where Lem gave her a\r\nquestioning look--but she shook her head, and he did not wait for the\r\ndistribution of the last mail that day; past the great mansion of Isaac\r\nD. Worthington, where the iron mastiffs on the lawn were up to their\r\nmuzzles in snow. After that they took the turn to the right, which was\r\nthe road to Coniston.\r\n\r\nWell-remembered road, and in winter or summer, Cynthia knew every tree\r\nand farmhouse beside it. Now it consisted of two deep grooves in the deep\r\nsnow; that was all, save for a curving turnout here and there for team to\r\npass team. Well-remembered scene! How often had Cynthia looked upon it in\r\nhappier days! Such a crust was on the snow as would bear a heavy man; and\r\nthe pasture hillocks were like glazed cakes in the window of a baker's\r\nshop. Never had the western sky looked so yellow through the black\r\ncolumns of the pine trunks. A lonely, beautiful road it was that evening.\r\n\r\nFor a long time the silence of the great hills was broken only by the\r\nsweet jingle of the bells on the shaft. Many a day, winter and summer,\r\nLem had gone that road alone, whistling, and never before heeding that\r\nsilence. Now it seemed to symbolize a great sorrow: to be in subtle\r\nharmony with that of the girl at his side. What that sorrow was he could\r\nnot guess. The good man yearned to comfort her, and yet he felt his\r\ncomfort too humble to be noticed by such sorrow. He longed to speak, but\r\nfor the first time in his life feared the sound of his own voice. Cynthia\r\nhad not spoken since she left the station, had not looked at him, had not\r\nasked for the friends and neighbors whom she had loved so well--had not\r\nasked for Jethro! Was there any sorrow on earth to be felt like that? And\r\nwas there one to feel it?\r\n\r\nAt length, when they reached the great forest, Lem Hallowell knew that he\r\nmust speak or cry aloud. But what would be the sound of his voice--after\r\nsuch an age of disuse? Could he speak at all? Broken and hoarse and\r\nhideous though the sound might be, he must speak. And hoarse and broken\r\nit was. It was not his own, but still it was a voice.\r\n\r\n\"Folks--folks'll be surprised to see you, Cynthy.\"\r\n\r\nNo, he had not spoken at all. Yes, he had, for she answered him.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose they will, Lem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mighty glad to have you back, Cynthy. We think a sight of you. We missed\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Lem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jethro hain't lookin' for you by any chance, be he?\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she said. But the question startled her. Suppose he had not been at\r\nhome! She had never once thought of that. Could she have borne to wait\r\nfor him?\r\n\r\nAfter that Lem gave it up. He had satisfied himself as to his vocal\r\npowers, but he had not the courage even to whistle. The journey to\r\nConiston was faster in the winter, and at the next turn of the road the\r\nlittle village came into view. There it was, among the snows. The pain in\r\nCynthia's heart, so long benumbed, quickened when she saw it. How write\r\nof the sharpness of that pain to those who have never known it? The sight\r\nof every gable brought its agony,--the store with the checker-paned\r\nwindows, the harness shop, the meeting-house, the white parsonage on its\r\nlittle hill. Rias Richardson ran out of the store in his carpet slippers,\r\nbareheaded in the cold, and gave one shout. Lem heeded him not; did not\r\nstop there as usual, but drove straight to the tannery house and pulled\r\nup under the butternut tree. Milly Skinner ran out on the porch, and gave\r\none long look, and cried:--\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord, it's Cynthy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Where's Jethro?\" demanded Lem.\r\n\r\nMilly did not answer at once. She was staring at Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\"He's in the tannery shed,\" she said, \"choppin' wood.\" But still she kept\r\nher eyes on Cynthia's face. \"I'll fetch him.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Cynthia, \"I'll go to him there.\"\r\n\r\nShe took the path, leaving Millicent with her mouth open, too amazed to\r\nspeak again, and yet not knowing why.\r\n\r\nIn the tannery shed! Would Jethro remember what happened there almost six\r\nand thirty years before? Would he remember how that other Cynthia had\r\ncome to him there, and what her appeal had been?\r\n\r\nCynthia came to the doors. One of these was open now--both had been\r\nclosed that other evening against the storm of sleet--and she caught a\r\nglimpse of him standing on the floor of chips and bark--tan-bark no more.\r\nCynthia caught a glimpse of him, and love suddenly welled up into her\r\nheart as waters into a spring after a drought. He had not seen her, not\r\nheard the sound of the sleigh-bells. He was standing with his foot upon\r\nthe sawbuck and the saw across his knee, he was staring at the woodpile,\r\nand there was stamped upon his face a look which no man or woman had ever\r\nseen there, a look of utter loneliness and desolation, a look as of a\r\nsoul condemned to wander forever through the infinite, cold spaces\r\nbetween the worlds--alone.\r\n\r\nCynthia stopped at sight of it. What had been her misery and affliction\r\ncompared to this? Her limbs refused her, though she knew not whether she\r\nwould have fled or rushed into his arms. How long she stood thus, and he\r\nstood, may not be said, but at length he put down his foot and took the\r\nsaw from his knee, his eyes fell upon her, and his lips spoke her name.\r\n\r\n\"Cynthy!\"\r\n\r\nSpeechless, she ran to him and flung her arms about his neck, and he\r\ndropped the saw and held her tightly--even as he had held that other\r\nCynthia in that place in the year gone by. And yet not so. Now he clung\r\nto her with a desperation that was terrible, as though to let go of her\r\nwould be to fall into nameless voids beyond human companionship and love.\r\nBut at last he did release her, and stood looking down into her face, as\r\nif seeking to read a sentence there.\r\n\r\nAnd how was she to pronounce that sentence! Though her faith might be\r\ntaken away, her love remained, and grew all the greater because he needed\r\nit. Yet she knew that no subterfuge or pretence would avail her to hide\r\nwhy she had come. She could not hide it. It must be spoken out now,\r\nthough death was preferable.\r\n\r\nAnd he was waiting. Did he guess? She could not tell. He had spoken no\r\nword but her name. He had expressed no surprise at her appearance, asked\r\nno reasons for it. Superlatives of suffering or joy or courage are hard\r\nto convey--words fall so far short of the feeling. And Cynthia's pain was\r\nso far beyond tears.\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Jethro,\" she said, \"yesterday something--something happened. I\r\ncould not stay in Boston any longer.\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded.\r\n\r\n\"I had to come to you. I could not wait.\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded again.\r\n\r\n\"I--I read something.\" To take a white-hot iron and sear herself would\r\nhave been easier than this.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said.\r\n\r\nShe felt that the look was coming again--the look which she had surprised\r\nin his face. His hands dropped lifelessly from her shoulders, and he\r\nturned and went to the door, where he stood with his back to her,\r\nsilhouetted against the eastern sky all pink from the reflection of\r\nsunset. He would not help her. Perhaps he could not. The things were\r\ntrue. There had been a grain of hope within her, ready to sprout.\r\n\r\n\"I read two articles from the Newcastle Guardian about you--about your\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said. But he did not turn.\r\n\r\n\"How you had--how you had earned your living. How you had gained your\r\npower,\" she went on, her pain lending to her voice an exquisite note of\r\nmany modulations.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--Cynthy,\" he said, and still stared at the eastern sky.\r\n\r\nShe took two steps toward him, her arms outstretched, her fingers opening\r\nand closing. And then she stopped.\r\n\r\n\"I would believe no one,\" she said, \"I will believe no one--until--unless\r\nyou tell me. Uncle Jethro,\" she cried in agony, \"Uncle Jethro, tell me\r\nthat those things are not true!\"\r\n\r\nShe waited a space, but he did not stir. There was no sound, save the\r\nsong of Coniston Water under the shattered ice.\r\n\r\n\"Won't you speak to me?\" she whispered. \"Won't you tell me that they are\r\nnot true?\"\r\n\r\nHis shoulders shook convulsively. O for the right to turn to her and tell\r\nher that they were lies! He would have bartered his soul for it. What was\r\nall the power in the world compared to this priceless treasure he had\r\nlost? Once before he had cast it away, though without meaning to. Then he\r\ndid not know the eternal value of love--of such love as those two women\r\nhad given him. Now he knew that it was beyond value, the one precious\r\ngift of life, and the knowledge had come too late. Could he have saved\r\nhis life if he had listened to that other Cynthia?\r\n\r\n\"Won't you tell me that they are not true?\"\r\n\r\nEven then he did not turn to her, but he answered. Curious to relate,\r\nthough his heart was breaking, his voice was steady--steady as it always\r\nhad been.\r\n\r\n\"I--I've seen it comin', Cynthy,\" he said. \"I never knowed anything I was\r\nafraid of before--but I was afraid of this. I knowed what your notions of\r\nright and wrong was--your--your mother had them. They're the principles\r\nof good people. I--I knowed the day would come when you'd ask, but I\r\nwanted to be happy as long as I could. I hain't been happy, Cynthy. But\r\nyou was right when you said I'd tell you the truth. S-so I will. I guess\r\nthem things which you speak about are true--the way I got where I am, and\r\nthe way I made my livin'. They--they hain't put just as they'd ought to\r\nbe, perhaps, but that's the way I done it in the main.\"\r\n\r\nIt was thus that Jethro Bass met the supreme crisis of his life. And who\r\nshall say he did not meet it squarely and honestly? Few men of finer\r\nfibre and more delicate morals would have acquitted themselves as well.\r\nThat was a Judgment Day for Jethro; and though he knew it not, he spoke\r\nthrough Cynthia to his Maker, confessing his faults freely and humbly,\r\nand dwelling on the justness of his punishment; putting not forward any\r\ngood he may have done; nor thinking of it; nor seeking excuse because of\r\nthe light that was in him. Had he been at death's door in the face of\r\nnameless tortures, no man could have dragged such a confession from him.\r\nBut a great love had been given him, and to that love he must speak the\r\ntruth, even at the cost of losing it.\r\n\r\nBut he was not to lose it. Even as he was speaking a thrill of admiration\r\nran through Cynthia, piercing her sorrow. The superb strength of the man\r\nwas there in that simple confession, and it is in the nature of woman to\r\nadmire strength. He had fought his fight, and gained, and paid the price\r\nwithout a murmur, seeking no palliation. Cynthia had not come to that\r\ntrial--so bitter for her--as a judge. If the reader has seen youth and\r\ninnocence sitting in the seat of justice, with age and experience at the\r\nbar, he has mistaken Cynthia. She came to Coniston inexorable, it is\r\ntrue, because hers was a nature impelled to do right though it perish.\r\nShe did not presume to say what Jethro's lights and opportunities might\r\nhave been. Her own she knew, and by them she must act accordingly.\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished speaking, she stole silently to his side and slipped\r\nher hand in his. He trembled violently at her touch.\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Jethro,\" she said in a low tone, \"I love you.\"\r\n\r\nAt the words he trembled more violently still.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, Cynthy,\" he answered thickly, \"don't say that--I--I don't expect\r\nit, Cynthy, I know you can't--'twouldn't be right, Cynthy. I hain't fit\r\nfor it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Jethro,\" she said, \"I love you better than I have ever loved you\r\nin my life.\"\r\n\r\nOh, how welcome were the tears! and how human! He turned, pitifully\r\nincredulous, wondering that she should seek by deceit to soften the blow;\r\nhe saw them running down her cheeks, and he believed. Yes, he believed,\r\nthough it seemed a thing beyond belief. Unworthy, unfit though he were,\r\nshe loved him. And his own love as he gazed at her, sevenfold increased\r\nas it had been by the knowledge of losing her, changed in texture from\r\nhomage to worship--nay, to adoration. His punishment would still be\r\nheavy; but whence had come such a wondrous gift to mitigate it?\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't you believe me?\" she cried, \"can't you see that it is true?\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet he could only hold her there at arm's length with that new and\r\nstrange reverence in his face. He was not worthy to touch her, but still\r\nshe loved him.\r\n\r\nThe flush had faded from the eastern sky, and the faintest border of\r\nyellow light betrayed the ragged outlines of the mountain as they walked\r\ntogether to the tannery house.\r\n\r\nMillicent, in the kitchen, was making great preparations--for Millicent.\r\nMiss Skinner was a person who had hitherto laid it down as a principle of\r\nlife to pay deference or do honor to no human made of mere dust, like\r\nherself. Millicent's exception; if Cynthia had thought about it, was a\r\ntribute of no mean order. Cynthia, alas, did not think about it: she did\r\nnot know that, in her absence, the fire had not been lighted in the\r\nevening, Jethro supping on crackers and milk and Milly partaking of the\r\nevening meal at home. Moreover, Miss Skinner had an engagement with a\r\nyoung man. Cynthia saw the fire, and threw off her sealskin coat which\r\nMr. and Mrs. Merrill had given her for Christmas, and took down the\r\nsaucepan from the familiar nail on which it hung. It was a miraculous\r\nfact, for which she did not attempt to account, that she was almost\r\nhappy: happy, indeed, in comparison to that which had been her state\r\nsince the afternoon before. Millicent snatched the saucepan angrily from\r\nher hand.\r\n\r\n\"What be you doin', Cynthy?\" she demanded.\r\n\r\nSuch was Miss Skinner's little way of showing deference. Though deference\r\nis not usually vehement, Miss Skinner's was very real, nevertheless.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Milly, what's the matter?\" exclaimed Cynthia, in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"You hain't a-goin' to do any cookin', that's all,\" said Milly, very red\r\nin the face.\r\n\r\n\"But I've always helped,\" said Cynthia. \"Why not?\"\r\n\r\nWhy not? A tribute was one thing, but to have to put the reasons for that\r\ntribute, into words was quite another.\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" cried Milly, \"because you hain't a-goin' to, that's all.\"\r\n\r\nStrange deference! But Cynthia turned and looked at the girl with a\r\nlittle, sad smile of comprehension and affection. She took her by the\r\nshoulders and kissed her.\r\n\r\nWhereupon a most amazing thing happened--Millicent burst into\r\ntears--wild, ungovernable tears they were.\r\n\r\n\"Because you hain't a-goin' to,\" she repeated, her words interspersed\r\nwith violent sobs. \"You go 'way, Cynthy,\" she cried, \"git out!\"\r\n\r\n\"Milly,\" said Cynthia, shaking her head, \"you ought to be ashamed of\r\nyourself.\" But they were not words of reproof. She took a little lamp\r\nfrom the shelf, and went up the narrow stairs to her own room in the\r\ngable, where Lemuel had deposited the rawhide trunk.\r\n\r\nThough she had had nothing all day, she felt no hunger, but for Milly's\r\nsake she tried hard to eat the supper when it came. Before it had fairly\r\nbegun Moses Hatch had arrived, with Amandy and Eben; and Rias Richardson\r\ncame in, and other neighbors, to say a word of welcome to hear (if the\r\ntruth be not too disparaging to their characters) the reasons for her\r\nsudden appearance, and such news of her Boston experiences as she might\r\nchoose to give them. They had learned from Lem Hallowell that Cynthia had\r\nreturned a lady: a real lady, not a sham one who relied on airs and\r\ngraces, such as had come to Coniston the summer before to look for a\r\nsummer place on the painter's recommendation. Lem was not a gossip, in\r\nthe disagreeable sense of the term, and he had not said a word to his\r\nneighbors of his feelings on that terrible drive from Brampton. Knowing\r\nthat some blow had fallen upon Cynthia, he would have spared her these\r\nvisits if he could. But Lem was wise and kind, so he merely said that she\r\nhad returned a lady.\r\n\r\nAnd they had found a lady. As they stood or sat around the kitchen (Eben\r\nand Rias stood), Cynthia talked to them--about Coniston: rather, be it\r\nsaid, that they talked about Coniston in answer to her questions. The\r\nsledding had been good; Moses had hauled so many thousand feet of lumber\r\nto Brampton; Sam Price's woman (she of Harwich) had had a spell of\r\nsciatica; Chester Perkins's bull had tossed his brother-in-law, come from\r\nIowy on a visit, and broke his leg; yes, Amandy guessed her dyspepsy was\r\nsomewhat improved since she had tried Graham's Golden Remedy--it made her\r\nfeel real lighthearted; Eben (blushing furiously) was to have the Brook\r\nFarm in the spring; there was a case of spotted fever in Tarleton.\r\n\r\nYes, Lem Hallowell had been right, Cynthia was a lady, but not a mite\r\nstuck up. What was the difference in her? Not her clothes, which she wore\r\nas if she had been used to them all her life. Poor Cynthia, the clothes\r\nwere simple enough. Not her manner, which was as kind and sweet as ever.\r\nWhat was it that compelled their talk about themselves, that made them\r\nrefrain from asking those questions about Boston, and why she had come\r\nback? Some such query was running in their minds as they talked, while\r\nJethro, having finished his milk and crackers, sat silent at the end of\r\nthe table with his eyes upon her. He rose when Mr. Satterlee came in.\r\n\r\nMr. Satterlee looked at her, and then he went quietly across the room and\r\nkissed her. But then Mr. Satterlee was the minister. Cynthia thought his\r\nhair a little thinner and the lines in his face a little deeper. And Mr.\r\nSatterlee thought perhaps he was the only one of the visitors who guessed\r\nwhy she had come back. He laid his thin hand on her head, as though in\r\nbenediction, and sat down beside her.\r\n\r\n\"And how is the learning, Cynthia?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nNow, indeed, they were going to hear something at last. An intuition\r\nimpelled Cynthia to take advantage of that opportunity.\r\n\r\n\"The learning has become so great, Mr. Satterlee,\" she said, \"that I have\r\ncome back to try to make some use of it. It shall be wasted no more.\"\r\n\r\nShe did not dare to look at Jethro, but she was aware that he had sat\r\ndown abruptly. What sacrifice will not a good woman make to ease the\r\nburden of those whom she loves! And Jethro's burden would be heavy\r\nenough. Such a woman will speak almost gayly, though her heart be heavy.\r\nBut Cynthia's was lighter now than it had been.\r\n\r\n\"I was always sure you would not waste your learning, Cynthia,\" said Mr.\r\nSatterlee, gravely; \"that you would make the most of the advantages God\r\nhas given you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am going to try, Mr. Satterlee. I cannot be content in idleness. I was\r\nwasting time in Boston, and I--I was not happy so far away from you\r\nall--from Uncle Jethro. Mr. Satterlee, I am going to teach school. I have\r\nalways wanted to, and now I have made up my mind to do it.\"\r\n\r\nThis was Jethro's punishment. But had she not lightened it for him a\r\nlittle by choosing this way of telling him that she could not eat his\r\nbread or partake of his bounty? Though by reason of that bounty she was\r\nwhat she was, she could not live and thrive on it longer, coming as it\r\ndid from such a source. Mr. Satterlee might perhaps surmise the truth,\r\nbut the town and village would think her ambition a very natural one,\r\ncertainly no better time could have been chosen to announce it.\r\n\r\n\"To teach school.\" She was sure now that Mr. Satterlee knew and approved,\r\nand perceived something, at least, of her little ruse. He was a man whose\r\ntalents fitted him for a larger flock than he had at Coniston, but he\r\npossessed neither the graces demanded of city ministers nor the power of\r\npushing himself. Never was a more retiring man. The years she had spent\r\nin his study had not gone for nothing, for he who has cherished the bud\r\ncan predict what the flower will be, and Mr. Satterlee knew her\r\nspiritually better than any one else in Coniston. He had heard of her\r\nreturn, and had walked over to the tannery house, full of fears, the\r\nremembrance of those expressions of simple faith in Jethro coming back to\r\nhis mind. Had the revelation which he had so long expected come at last?\r\nand how had she taken it? would it embitter her? The good man believed\r\nthat it would not, and now he saw that it had not, and rejoiced\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\n\"To teach school,\" he said. \"I expected that you would wish to, Cynthia.\r\nIt is a desire that most of us have, who like books and what is in them.\r\nI should have taught school if I had not become a minister. It is a high\r\ncalling, and an absorbing one, to develop the minds of the young.\" Mr.\r\nSatterlee was often a little discursive, though there was reason for it\r\non this occasion, and Moses Hatch half closed his eyes and bowed his head\r\na little out of sheer habit at the sound of the minister's voice. But he\r\nraised it suddenly at the next words. \"I was in Brampton yesterday, and\r\nsaw Mr. Graves, who is on the prudential committee of that district. You\r\nmay not have heard that Miss Goddard has left. They have not yet\r\nsucceeded in filling her place, and I think it more than likely that you\r\ncan get it.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia glanced at Jethro, but the habit of years was so strong in him\r\nthat he gave no sign.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think so, Mr. Satterlee?\" she said gratefully. \"I had heard of\r\nthe place, and hoped for it, because it is near enough for me to spend\r\nthe Saturdays and Sundays with Uncle Jethro. And I meant to go to\r\nBrampton tomorrow to see about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will go with you,\" said the minister; \"I have business in Brampton\r\nto-morrow.\" He did not mention that this was the business.\r\n\r\nWhen at length they had all departed, Jethro rose and went about the\r\nhouse making fast the doors, as was his custom, while Cynthia sat staring\r\nthrough the bars at the dying embers in the stove. He knew now, and it\r\nwas inevitable that he should know, what she had made up her mind to do.\r\nIt had been decreed that she, who owed him everything, should be made to\r\npass this most dreadful of censures upon his whole life. Oh, the cruelty\r\nof that decree!\r\n\r\nHow, she mused, would it affect him? Had the blow been so great that he\r\nwould relinquish those practices which had become a lifelong habit with\r\nhim? Would he (she caught her breath at this thought) would he abandon\r\nthat struggle with Isaac D. Worthington in which he was striving to\r\nmaintain the mastery of the state by those very practices? Cynthia hated\r\nMr. Worthington. The term is not too strong, and it expresses her\r\nfeeling. But she would have got down on her knees on the board floor of\r\nthe kitchen that very night and implored Jethro to desist from that\r\ncontest, if she could. She remembered how, in her innocence, she had\r\nbelieved that the people had given Jethro his power,--in those days when\r\nshe was so proud of that very power,--now she knew that he had wrested it\r\nfrom them. What more supreme sacrifice could he make than to relinquish\r\nit! Ah, there was a still greater sacrifice that Jethro was to make, had\r\nshe known it.\r\n\r\nHe came and stood over her by the stove, and she looked up into his face\r\nwith these yearnings in her eyes. Yes, she would have thrown herself on\r\nher knees, if she could. But she could not. Perhaps he would abandon that\r\nstruggle. Perhaps--perhaps his heart was broken. And could a man with a\r\nbroken heart still fight on? She took his hand and pressed it against her\r\nface, and he felt that it was wet with her tears.\r\n\r\n\"B-better go to bed now, Cynthy,\" he said; \"m-must be worn out--m-must be\r\nworn out.\"\r\n\r\nHe stooped and kissed her on the forehead. It was thus that Jethro Bass\r\naccepted his sentence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nAt sunrise, in that Coniston hill-country, it is the western hills which\r\nare red; and a distant hillock on the meadow farm which was soon to be\r\nEden's looked like the daintiest conical cake with pink icing as Cynthia\r\nsurveyed the familiar view the next morning. There was the mountain, the\r\npastures on the lower slopes all red, too, and higher up the dark masses\r\nof bristling spruce and pine and hemlock mottled with white where the\r\nsnow-covered rocks showed through.\r\n\r\nSunrise in January is not very early, and sunrise at any season is not\r\nearly for Coniston. Cynthia sat at her window, and wondered whether that\r\nbeautiful landscape would any longer be hers. Her life had grown up on\r\nit; but now her life had changed. Would the beauty be taken from it, too?\r\nAlmost hungrily she gazed at the scene. She might look upon it\r\nagain--many times, perhaps--but a conviction was strong in her that its\r\ndaily possession would now be only a memory.\r\n\r\nMr. Satterlee was as good as his word, for he was seated in the stage\r\nwhen it drew up at the tannery house, ready to go to Brampton. And as\r\nthey drove away Cynthia took one last look at Jethro standing on the\r\nporch. It seemed to her that it had been given her to feel all things,\r\nand to know all things: to know, especially, this strange man, Jethro\r\nBass, as none other knew him, and to love him as none other loved him.\r\nThe last severe wrench was come, and she had left him standing there\r\nalone in the cold, divining what was in his heart as though it were in\r\nher own. How worthless was this mighty power which he had gained, how\r\nhateful, when he could not bestow the smallest fragment of it upon one\r\nwhom he loved? Someone has described hell as disqualification in the face\r\nof opportunity. Such was Jethro's torment that morning as he saw her\r\ndrive away, the minister in the place where he should have been, at her\r\nside, and he, Jethro Bass, as helpless as though he had indeed been in\r\nthe pit among the flames. Had the prudential committee at Brampton\r\npromised the appointment ten times over, he might still have obtained it\r\nfor her by a word. And he must not speak even that word. Who shall say\r\nthat a large part of the punishment of Jethro Bass did not come to him in\r\nthe life upon this earth.\r\n\r\nSome such thoughts were running in Cynthia's head as they jingled away to\r\nBrampton that dazzling morning. Perhaps the stage driver, too, who knew\r\nsomething of men and things and who meddled not at all, had made a guess\r\nat the situation. He thought that Cynthia's spirits seemed lightened a\r\nlittle, and he meant to lighten them more; so he joked as much as his\r\nrespect for his passengers would permit, and told the news of Brampton.\r\nNot the least of the news concerned the first citizen of that place.\r\nThere was a certain railroad in the West which had got itself much into\r\nCongress, and much into the newspapers, and Isaac D. Worthington had got\r\nhimself into that railroad: was gone West, it was said on that business,\r\nand might not be back for many weeks. And Lem Hallowell remembered when\r\nMr. Worthington was a slim-cheated young man wandering up and down\r\nConiston Water in search of health. Good Mr. Satterlee, thinking this a\r\nsafe subject, allowed himself to be led into a discussion of the first\r\ncitizen's career, which indeed had something fascinating in it.\r\n\r\nThus they jingled into Brampton Street and stopped before the cottage of\r\nJudge Graves--a courtesy title. The judge himself came to the door and\r\nbestowed a pronounced bow on the minister, for Mr. Satterlee was honored\r\nin Brampton. Just think of what Ezra Graves might have looked like, and\r\nyou have him. He greeted Cynthia, too, with a warm welcome--for Ezra\r\nGraves,--and ushered them into a best parlor which was reserved for\r\nministers and funerals and great occasions in general, and actually\r\nraised the blinds. Then Mr. Satterlee, with much hemming and hawing,\r\nstated the business which had brought them, while Cynthia looked out of\r\nthe window.\r\n\r\nMr. Graves sat and twirled his lean thumbs. He went so far as to say that\r\nhe admired a young woman who scorned to live in idleness, who wished to\r\nimpart the learning with which she had been endowed. Fifteen applicants\r\nwere under consideration for the position, and the prudential committee\r\nhad so far been unable to declare that any of them were completely\r\nqualified. (It was well named, that prudential committee?) Mr. Graves,\r\nfurthermore, volunteered that he had expressed a wish to Colonel Prescott\r\n(Oh, Ephraim, you too have got a title with your new honors!), to Colonel\r\nPrescott and others, that Miss Wetherell might take the place. The middle\r\nterm opened on the morrow, and Miss Bruce, of the Worthington Free\r\nLibrary, had been induced to teach until a successor could be appointed,\r\nalthough it was most inconvenient for Miss Bruce.\r\n\r\nCould Miss Wetherell start in at once, provided the committee agreed?\r\nCynthia replied that she would like nothing better. There would be an\r\nexamination before Mr. Errol, the Brampton Superintendent of Schools. In\r\nshort, owing to the pressing nature of the occasion, the judge would take\r\nthe liberty of calling the committee together immediately. Would Mr.\r\nSatterlee and Miss Wetherell make themselves at home in the parlor?\r\n\r\nIt very frequently happens that one member of a committee is the brain,\r\nand the other members form the body of it. It was so in this case. Ezra\r\nGraves typified all of prudence there was about it, which, it must be\r\nadmitted, was a great deal. He it was who had weighed in the balance the\r\nfifteen applicants and found them wanting. Another member of the\r\ncommittee was that comfortable Mr. Dodd, with the tuft of yellow beard,\r\nthe hardware dealer whom we have seen at the baseball game. Mr. Dodd was\r\nnot a person who had opinions unless they were presented to him from\r\ncertain sources, and then he had been known to cling to them tenaciously.\r\nIt is sufficient to add that, when Cynthia Wetherell's name was mentioned\r\nto him, he remembered the girl to whom Bob Worthington had paid such\r\nmarked attentions on the grand stand. He knew literally nothing else\r\nabout Cynthia. Judge Graves, apparently, knew all about her; this was\r\nsufficient, at that time, for Mr. Dodd; he was sick and tired of the\r\nwhole affair, and if, by the grace of heaven, an applicant had been sent\r\nwho conformed with Judge Graves's multitude of requirements, he was\r\ndevoutly thankful. The other member, Mr. Hill, was a feed and lumber\r\ndealer, and not a very good one, for he was always in difficulties;\r\ncertain scholarly attainments were attributed to him, and therefore he\r\nhad been put on the committee. They met in Mr. Dodd's little office back\r\nof the store, and in five minutes Cynthia was a schoolmistress, subject\r\nto examination by Mr. Errol.\r\n\r\nJust a word about Mr. Errol. He was a retired lawyer, with some means,\r\nwho took an interest in town affairs to occupy his time. He had a very\r\ndelicate wife, whom he had been obliged to send South at the beginning of\r\nthe winter. There she had for a while improved, but had been taken ill\r\nagain, and two days before Cynthia's appointment he had been summoned to\r\nher bedside by a telegram. Cynthia could go into the school, and her\r\nexamination would take place when Mr. Errol returned.\r\n\r\nAll this was explained by the judge when, half an hour after he had left\r\nthem, he returned to the best parlor. Miss Wetherell would, then, be\r\nprepared to take the school the following morning. Whereupon the judge\r\nshook hands with her, and did not deny that he had been instrumental in\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\n\"And, Mr. Satterlee, I am so grateful to you,\" said Cynthia, when they\r\nwere in the street once more.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Cynthia, I did nothing,\" answered the minister, quite bewildered\r\nby the quick turn affairs had taken; \"it is your own good reputation that\r\ngot you the place.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless Mr. Satterlee had done his share in the matter. He had known\r\nMr. Graves for a long time, and better than any other person in Brampton.\r\nMr. Graves remembered Cynthia Ware, and indeed had spoken to Cynthia that\r\nday about her mother. Mr. Graves had also read poor William Wetherell's\r\ncontributions to the Newcastle Guardian, and he had not read that paper\r\nsince they had ceased. From time to time Mr. Satterlee had mentioned his\r\npupil to the judge, whose mind had immediately flown to her when the\r\nvacancy occurred. So it all came about.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" said Mr. Satterlee, \"what will you do, Cynthia? We've got the\r\ngood part of a day to arrange where you will live, before the stage\r\nreturns.\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't go back to-night, I think,\" said Cynthia, turning her head away;\r\n\"if you would be good enough to tell Uncle Jethro to send my trunk and\r\nsome other things.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps that is just as well,\" assented the minister, understanding\r\nperfectly. \"I have thought that Miss Bruce might be glad to board you,\"\r\nhe continued, after a pause. \"Let us go to see her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Satterlee,\" said Cynthia, \"would you mind if we went first to see\r\nCousin Ephraim?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, of course, we must see Ephraim,\" said Mr. Satterlee, briskly. So\r\nthey walked on past the mansion of the first citizen, and the new block\r\nof stores which the first citizen had built, to the old brick building\r\nwhich held the Brampton post-office, and right through the door of the\r\npartition into the sanctum of the postmaster himself, which some one had\r\nnicknamed the Brampton Club. On this occasion the postmaster was seated\r\nin his shirt sleeves by the stove, alone, his listeners being\r\nconspicuously absent. Cynthia, who had caught a glimpse of him through\r\nthe little mail-window, thought he looked very happy and comfortable.\r\n\r\n\"Great Tecumseh!\" he cried,--an exclamation he reserved for extraordinary\r\noccasions, \"if it hain't Cynthy!\"\r\n\r\nHe started to hobble toward her, but Cynthia ran to him.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" said he, looking at her closely after the greeting was over, \"you\r\nbe changed, Cynthy. Mercy, I don't know as I'd have dared done that if\r\nI'd seed you first. What have you b'en doin' to yourself? You must have\r\nseed a whole lot down there in Boston. And you're a full-blown lady,\r\ntoo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, I'm not, Cousin Eph,\" she answered, trying to smile.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you be,\" he insisted, still scrutinizing her, vainly trying to\r\naccount for the change. Tact, as we know, was not Ephraim's strong point.\r\nNow he shook his head. \"You always was beyond me. Got a sort of air about\r\nyou, and it grows on you, too. Wouldn't be surprised,\" he declared,\r\nspeaking now to the minister, \"wouldn't be a mite surprised to see her in\r\nthe White House, some day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Cousin Eph,\" said Cynthia, coloring a little, \"you mustn't talk\r\nnonsense. What have you done with your coat? You have no business to go\r\nwithout it with your rheumatism.\"\r\n\r\n\"It hain't b'en so bad since Uncle Sam took me over again, Cynthy,\" he\r\nanswered, \"with nothin' to do but sort letters in a nice hot room.\" The\r\nroom was hot, indeed. \"But where did you come from?\"\r\n\r\n\"I grew tired of being taught, Cousin Eph. I--I've always wanted to\r\nteach. Mr. Satterlee has been with me to see Mr. Graves, and they've\r\ngiven me Miss Goddard's place. I'm coming to Brampton to live, to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Great Tecumseh!\" exclaimed Ephraim again, overpowered by the yews. \"I\r\nwant to know! What does Jethro say to that?\"\r\n\r\n\"He--he is willing,\" she replied in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Ephraim, \"I always thought you'd come to it. It's in the\r\nblood, I guess--teachin'. Your mother had it too. I'm kind of sorry for\r\nJethro, though, so I be. But I'm glad for myself, Cynthy. So you're\r\ncomin' to Brampton to live with me!\r\n\r\n\"I was going to ask Miss Bruce to take me in,\" said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\"No you hain't, anything of the kind,\" said Ephraim, indignantly. \"I've\r\ngot a little house up the street, and a room all ready for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you let me share expenses, Cousin Eph?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll let you do anything you want,\" said he, \"so's you come. Don't you\r\nthink she'd ought to come and take care of an old man, Mr. Satterlee?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Satterlee turned. He had been contemplating, during this\r\nconversation, a life-size print of General Grant under two crossed flags,\r\nthat was hung conspicuously on the wall.\r\n\r\n\"I do not think you could do better, Cynthia,\" he answered, smiling. The\r\nminister liked Ephraim, and he liked a little joke, occasionally. He felt\r\nthat one would not be, particularly out of place just now; so he\r\nrepeated, \"I do not think you could do better than to accept the offer of\r\nColonel Prescott.\"\r\n\r\nEphraim grew very red, as was his wont when twitted about his new title.\r\nHe took things literally.\r\n\r\n\"I hain't a colonel, no more than you be, Mr. Satterlee. But the boys\r\ndown here will have it so.\"\r\n\r\nThree days later, by the early train which leaves the state capital at an\r\nunheard-of hour in the morning, a young man arrived in Brampton. His jaw\r\nseemed squarer than ever to the citizens who met the train out of\r\ncuriosity, and to Mr. Dodd, who was expecting a pump; and there was a set\r\nlook on his face like that of a man who is going into a race or a fight.\r\nMr. Dodd, though astonished, hastened toward him.\r\n\r\n\"Well, this is unexpected, Bob,\" said he. \"How be you? Harvard College\r\nfailed up?\"\r\n\r\nFor Mr. Dodd never let slip a chance to assure a member of the\r\nWorthington family of his continued friendship.\r\n\r\n\"How are you, Mr. Dodd?\" answered Bob, nodding at him carelessly, and\r\npassing on. Mr. Dodd did not dare to follow. What was young Worthington\r\ndoing in Brampton, and his father in the West on that railroad business?\r\nFilled with curiosity, Mr. Dodd forgot his pump, but Bob was already\r\nstriding into Brampton Street, carrying his bag. If he had stopped for a\r\nfew moments with the hardware dealer, or chatted with any of the dozen\r\npeople who bowed and stared at him, he might have saved himself a good\r\ndeal of trouble. He turned in at the Worthington mansion, and rang the\r\nbell, which was answered by Sarah, the housemaid.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Bob!\" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Where's Mrs. Holden?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nMrs. Holden was the elderly housekeeper. She had gone, unfortunately, to\r\nvisit a bereaved relative; unfortunately for Bob, because she, too, might\r\nhave told him something.\r\n\r\n\"Get me some breakfast, Sarah. Anything,\" he commanded, \"and tell Silas\r\nto hitch up the black trotters to my cutter.\"\r\n\r\nSarah, though in consternation, did as she was bid. The breakfast was\r\nforthcoming, and in half an hour Silas had the black trotters at the\r\ndoor. Bob got in without a word, seized the reins, the cutter flew down\r\nBrampton Street (observed by many of the residents thereof) and turned\r\ninto the Coniston road. Silas said nothing. Silas, as a matter of fact,\r\nnever did say anything. He had been the Worthington coachman for five and\r\ntwenty years, and he was known in Brampton as Silas the Silent. Young Mr.\r\nWorthington had no desire to talk that morning.\r\n\r\nThe black trotters covered the ten miles in much quicker time than Lem\r\nHallowell could do it in his stage, but the distance seemed endless to\r\nBob. It was not much more than half an hour after he had left Brampton\r\nStreet, however, that he shot past the store, and by the time Rias\r\nRichardson in his carpet slippers reached the platform the cutter was in\r\nfront of the tannery house, and the trotters, with their sides smoking,\r\nwere pawing up the snow under the butternut tree.\r\n\r\nBob leaped out, hurried up the path, and knocked at the door. It was\r\nopened by Jethro Bass himself!\r\n\r\n\"How do you do, Mr. Bass,\" said the young man, gravely, and he held out\r\nhis hand. Jethro gave him such a scrutinizing look as he had given many a\r\nman whose business he cared to guess, but Bob looked fearlessly into his\r\neyes. Jethro took his hand.\r\n\r\n\"C-come in,\" he said.\r\n\r\nBob went into that little room where Jethro and Cynthia had spent so many\r\nnights together, and his glance flew straight to the picture on the\r\nwall,--the portrait of Cynthia Wetherell in crimson and seed pearls, so\r\nstrangely set amidst such surroundings. His glance went to the portrait,\r\nand his feet followed, as to a lodestone. He stood in front of it for\r\nmany minutes, in silence, and Jethro watched him. At last he turned.\r\n\r\n\"Where is she?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nIt was a queer question, and Jethro's answer was quite as lacking in\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\n\"G-gone to Brampton--gone to Brampton.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gone to Brampton! Do you mean to say--? What is she doing there?\" Bob\r\ndemanded.\r\n\r\n\"Teachin' school,\" said Jethro; \"g-got Miss Goddard's place.\"\r\n\r\nBob did not reply for a moment. The little schoolhouse was the only\r\nbuilding in Brampton he had glanced at as he came through. Mrs. Merrill\r\nhad told him that she might take that place, but he had little imagined\r\nshe was already there on her platform facing the rows of shining little\r\nfaces at the desks. He had deemed it more than possible that he might see\r\nJethro at Coniston, but he had not taken into account that which he might\r\nsay to him. Bob had, indeed, thought of nothing but Cynthia, and of the\r\nblow that had fallen upon her. He had tried to realize the, multiple\r\nphases of the situation which confronted him. Here was the man who, by\r\nthe conduct of his life, had caused the blow; he, too, was her\r\nbenefactor; and again, this same man was engaged in the bitterest of\r\nconflicts with his father, Isaac D. Worthington, and it was this conflict\r\nwhich had precipitated that blow. Bob could not have guessed, by looking\r\nat Jethro Bass, how great was the sorrow which had fallen upon him. But\r\nBob knew that Jethro hated his father, must hate him now, because of\r\nCynthia, with a hatred given to few men to feel. He thought that Jethro\r\nwould crush Mr. Worthington and ruin him if he could; and Bob believed he\r\ncould.\r\n\r\nWhat was he to say? He did not fear Jethro, for Bob Worthington had\r\ncourage enough; but these things were running in his mind, and he felt\r\nthe power of the man before him, as all men did. Bob went to the window\r\nand came back again. He knew that he must speak.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Bass,\" he said at last, \"did Cynthia ever mention me to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Jethro.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Bass, I love her. I have told her so, and I have asked her to be my\r\nwife.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no need, indeed, to have told Jethro this. The shock of that\r\nrevelation had come to him when he had seen the trotters, had been\r\nconfirmed when the young man had stood before the portrait. Jethro's face\r\nmight have twitched when Bob stood there with his back to him.\r\n\r\nJethro could not speak. Once more there had come to him a moment when he\r\nwould not trust his voice to ask a question. He dreaded the answer,\r\nthough none might have surmised this. He knew Cynthia. He knew that, when\r\nshe had given her heart, it was for all time. He dreaded the answer;\r\nbecause it might mean that her sorrow was doubled.\r\n\r\n\"I believe,\" Bob continued painfully, seeing that Jethro would say\r\nnothing, \"I believe that Cynthia loves me. I should not dare to say it or\r\nto hope it, without reason. She has not said so, but--\" the words were\r\nvery hard for him, yet he stuck manfully to the truth; \"but she told me\r\nto write to my father and let him know what I had done, and not to come\r\nback to her until I had his answer. This,\" he added, wondering that a man\r\ncould listen to such a thing without a sign, \"this was before--before she\r\nhad any idea of coming home.\"\r\n\r\nYes, Cynthia, did love him. There was no doubt about it in Jethro's mind.\r\nShe would not have bade Bob write to his father if she had not loved him.\r\nStill Jethro did not speak, but by some intangible force compelled Bob to\r\ngo on.\r\n\r\n\"I shall write to my father as soon as he comes back from the West, but I\r\nwish to say to you, Mr. Bass, that whatever his answer contains, I mean\r\nto marry Cynthia. Nothing can shake me from that resolution. I tell you\r\nthis because my father is fighting you, and you know what he will say.\"\r\n(Jethro knew Dudley Worthington well enough to appreciate that this would\r\nmake no particular difference in his opposition to the marriage except to\r\nmake that opposition more vehement.) \"And because you do not know me,\"\r\ncontinued Bob. \"When I say a thing, I mean it. Even if my father cuts me\r\noff and casts me out, I will marry Cynthia. Good-by, Mr. Bass.\"\r\n\r\nJethro took the young man's hand again. Bob imagined that he even pressed\r\nit--a little--something he had never done before.\r\n\r\n\"Good-by, Bob.\"\r\n\r\nBob got as far as the door.\r\n\r\n\"Er--go back to Harvard, Bob?\"\r\n\r\n\"I intend to, Mr. Bass.\"\r\n\r\n\"Er--Bob?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"D-don't quarrel with your father--don't quarrel with your father.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shan't be the one to quarrel, Mr. Bass.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bob--hain't you pretty young--pretty young?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Bob, rather unexpectedly, \"I am.\" Then he added, \"I know my\r\nown mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"P-pretty young. Don't want to get married yet awhile--do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I do,\" said Bob, \"but I suppose I shan't be able to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Er--wait awhile, Bob. Go back to Harvard. W-wouldn't write that letter\r\nif I was you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I will. I'll not have him think I'm ashamed of what I've done. I'm\r\nproud of it, Mr. Bass.\"\r\n\r\nIn the eyes of Coniston, which had been waiting for his reappearance, Bob\r\nWorthington jumped into the sleigh and drove off. He left behind him\r\nJethro Bass, who sat in his chair the rest of the morning with his head\r\nbent in revery so deep that Millicent had to call him twice to his simple\r\ndinner. Bob left behind him, too, a score of rumors, sprung full grown\r\ninto life with his visit. Men and women an incredible distance away heard\r\nthem in an incredible time: those in the village found an immediate\r\npretext for leaving their legitimate occupation and going to the store,\r\nand a gathering was in session there when young Mr. Worthington drove\r\npast it on his way back. Bob thought little about the rumors, and not\r\nthinking of them it did not occur to him that they might affect Cynthia.\r\nThe only person then in Coniston whom he thought about was Jethro Bass.\r\nBob decided that his liking for Jethro had not diminished, but rather\r\nincreased; he admired Jethro for the advice he had given, although he did\r\nnot mean to take it. And for the first time he pitied him.\r\n\r\nBob did not know that rumor, too, was spreading in Brampton. He had his\r\ndinner in the big walnut dining room all alone, and after it he smoked\r\nhis father's cigars and paced up and down the big hall, watching the\r\nclock. For he could not go to her in the school hours. At length he put\r\non his hat and hurried out, crossing the park-like enclosure in the\r\nmiddle of the street; bowed at by Mr. Dodd, who always seemed to be on\r\nhand, and others, and nodding absently in return. Concealment was not in\r\nBob Worthington's nature. He reached the post-office, where the partition\r\ndoor was open, and he walked right into a comparatively full meeting of\r\nthe Brampton Club. Ephraim sat in their midst, and for once he was not\r\ntelling war stories. He was silent. And the others fell suddenly silent,\r\ntoo, at Bob's entrance.\r\n\r\n\"How do you do, Mr. Prescott?\" he said, as Ephraim struggled to his feet.\r\n\"How is the rheumatism?\"\r\n\r\n\"How be you, Mr. Worthington?\" said Ephraim; \"this is a kind of a\r\nsurprise, hain't it?\" Ephraim was getting used to surprises. \"Well, it is\r\ngood-natured of you to come in and shake hands with an old soldier.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't mention it, Mr. Prescott,\" answered honest Bob, a little abashed,\r\n\"I should have done so anyway, but the fact is, I wanted to speak to you\r\na moment in private.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certain,\" said Ephraim, glancing helplessly around him, \"jest come out\r\nfront.\" That space, where the public were supposed to be, was the only\r\nprivate place in the Brampton post-office. But the members of the\r\nBrampton Club could take a hint, and with one consent began to make\r\nexcuses. Bob knew them all from boyhood and spoke to them all. Some of\r\nthem ventured to ask him if Harvard had bust up.\r\n\r\n\"Where does Cynthia-live?\" he demanded, coming straight to the point.\r\n\r\nEphraim stared at him for a moment in a bewildered fashion, and then a\r\nlight began to dawn on him.\r\n\r\n\"Lives with me,\" he answered. He was quite as ashamed, for Bob's sake, as\r\nif he himself had asked the question, and he went on talking to cover\r\nthat embarrassment. \"It's made some difference, too, sence she come.\r\nHouse looks like a different place. Afore she, come I cooked with a kit,\r\nsame as I used to in the harness shop. I l'arned it in the army. Cynthy's\r\ngot a stove.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not the way Ephraim would have gone about a love affair, had he\r\nhad one. Sam Price's were the approved methods in that section of the\r\ncountry, though Sam had overdone them somewhat. It was an unheard-of\r\nthing to ask a man right out like that where a girl lived.\r\n\r\n\"Much obliged,\" said Bob, and was gone. Ephraim raised his hands in\r\ndespair, and hobbled to the little window to get a last look at him.\r\nWhere were the proprieties in these days? The other aspect of the affair,\r\nwhat Mr. Worthington would think of it when he returned, did not occur to\r\nthe innocent mind of the old soldier until people began to talk about it\r\nthat afternoon. Then it worried him into another attack of rheumatism.\r\n\r\nHalf of Brampton must have seen Bob Worthington march up to the little\r\nyellow house which Ephraim had rented from John Billings. It had four\r\nrooms around the big chimney in the middle, and that was all. Simple as\r\nit was, an architect would have said that its proportions were nearly\r\nperfect. John Billings had it from his Grandfather Post, who built it,\r\nand though Brampton would have laughed at the statement, Isaac D.\r\nWorthington's mansion was not to be compared with it for beauty. The old\r\ncherry furniture was still in it, and the old wall papers and the\r\npanelling in the little room to the right which Cynthia had made into a\r\nsitting room.\r\n\r\nHalf of Brampton, too, must have seen Cynthia open the door and Bob walk\r\ninto the entry. Then the door was shut. But it had been held open for an\r\nappreciable time, however,--while you could count twenty,--because\r\nCynthia had not the power to close it. For a while she could only look\r\ninto his eyes, and he into hers. She had not seen him coming, she had but\r\nanswered the knock. Then, slowly, the color came into her cheeks, and she\r\nknew that she was trembling from head to foot.\r\n\r\n\"Cynthia,\" he said, \"mayn't I come in?\"\r\n\r\nShe did not answer, for fear her voice would tremble, too. And she could\r\nnot send him away in the face of all Brampton. She opened the door a\r\nlittle wider, a very little, and he went in. Then she closed it, and for\r\na moment they stood facing each other in the entry, which was lighted\r\nonly by the fan-light over the door, Cynthia with her back against the\r\nwall. He spoke her name again, his voice thick with the passion which had\r\novertaken him like a flood at the sight of her--a passion to seize her in\r\nhis arms, and cherish and comfort and protect her forever and ever. All\r\nthis he felt and more as he looked into her face and saw the traces of\r\nher great sorrow there. He had not thought that that face could be more\r\nbeautiful in its strength and purity, but it was even so.\r\n\r\n\"Cynthia-my love!\" he cried, and raised his arms. But a look as of a\r\ngreat fear came into her eyes, which for one exquisite moment had yielded\r\nto his own; and her breath came quickly, as though she were spent--as\r\nindeed she was. So far spent that the wall at her back was grateful.\r\n\r\n\"No!\" she said; \"no--you must not--you must not--you must not!\" Again and\r\nagain she repeated the words, for she could summon no others. They were a\r\nmandate--had he guessed it--to herself as to him. For the time her brain\r\nrefused its functions, and she could think of nothing but the fact that\r\nhe was there, beside her, ready to take her in his arms. How she longed\r\nto fly into them, none but herself knew--to fly into them as into a\r\nrefuge secure against the evil powers of the world. It was not reason\r\nthat restrained her then, but something higher in her, that restrained\r\nhim likewise. Without moving from the wall she pushed open the door of\r\nthe sitting room.\r\n\r\n\"Go in there,\" she said.\r\n\r\nHe went in as she bade him and stood before the flickering logs in the\r\nwide and shallow chimney-place--logs that seemed to burn on the very\r\nhearth itself, and yet the smoke rose unerring into the flue. No stove\r\nhad ever desecrated that room. Bob looked into the flames and waited, and\r\nCynthia stood in the entry fighting this second great battle which had\r\ncome upon her while her forces were still spent with that other one.\r\nWoman in her very nature is created to be sheltered and protected; and\r\nthe yearning in her, when her love is given, is intense as nature itself\r\nto seek sanctuary in that love. So it was with Cynthia leaning against\r\nthe entry wall, her arms full length in front of her, and her hands\r\nclasped as she prayed for strength to withstand the temptation. At last\r\nshe grew calmer, though her breath still came deeply, and she went into\r\nthe sitting room.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he knew, vaguely, why she had not followed him at once. He had\r\ngrown calmer himself, calmer with that desperation which comes to a man\r\nof his type when his soul and body are burning with desire for a woman.\r\nHe knew that he would have to fight for her with herself. He knew now\r\nthat she was too strong in her position to be carried by storm, and the\r\ninterval had given him time to collect himself. He did not dare at first\r\nto look up from the logs, for fear he should forget himself and be\r\ndefeated instantly.\r\n\r\n\"I have been to Coniston, Cynthia,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have been to Coniston this morning, and I have seen Mr. Bass, and I\r\nhave told him that I love you, and that I will never give you up. I told\r\nyou so in Boston, Cynthia,\" he said; \"I knew that this this trouble would\r\ncome to you. I would have given my life to have saved you from it--from\r\nthe least part of it. I would have given my life to have been able to say\r\n'it shall not touch you.' I saw it flowing in like a great sea between\r\nyou and me, and yet I could not tell you of it. I could not prepare you\r\nfor it. I could only tell you that I would never give you up, and I can\r\nonly repeat that now.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must, Bob,\" she answered, in a voice so low that it was almost a\r\nwhisper; \"you must give me up.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would not,\" he said, \"I would not if the words were written on all the\r\nrocks of Coniston Mountain. I love you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush,\" she said gently. \"I have to say some things to you. They will be\r\nvery hard to say, but you must listen to them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will listen,\" he said doggedly; \"but they will not affect my\r\ndetermination.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure you do not wish to drive me away from Brampton,\" she\r\ncontinued, in the same low voice, \"when I have found a place to earn my\r\nliving near-near Uncle Jethro.\"\r\n\r\nThese words told him all he had suspected--almost as much as though he\r\nhad been present at the scene in the tannery shed in Coniston. She knew\r\nnow the life of Jethro Bass, but he was still \"Uncle Jethro\" to her. It\r\nwas even as Bob had supposed,--that her affection once given could not be\r\ntaken away.\r\n\r\n\"Cynthia,\" he said, \"I would not by an act or a word annoy or trouble\r\nyou. If you bade me, I would go to the other side of the world to-morrow.\r\nYou must know that. But I should come back again. You must know, that,\r\ntoo. I should come back again for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bob,\" she said again, and her voice faltered a very little now, \"you\r\nmust know that I can never be your wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know it,\" he exclaimed, interrupting her vehemently, \"I will\r\nnot know it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Think,\" she said, \"think! I must say what I, have to say, however it\r\nhurts me. If it had not been for--for your father, those things never\r\nwould have been written. They were in his newspaper, and they express his\r\nfeelings toward--toward Uncle Jethro.\"\r\n\r\nOnce the words were out, she marvelled that she had found the courage to\r\npronounce them.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"yes, I know that, but listen--\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait,\" she went on, \"wait until I have finished. I am not speaking of\r\nthe pain I had when I read these things, I--I am not speaking of the\r\ntruth that may be in them--I have learned from them what I should have\r\nknown before, and felt, indeed, that your father will never consent\r\nto--to a marriage between us.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if he does not,\" cried Bob, \"if he does not, do you think that I\r\nwill abide by what he says, when my life's happiness depends upon you,\r\nand my life's welfare? I know that you are a good woman, and a true\r\nwoman, that you will be the best wife any man could have. Though he is my\r\nfather, he shall not deprive me of my soul, and he shall not take my life\r\naway from me.\"\r\n\r\nAs Cynthia listened she thought that never had words sounded sweeter than\r\nthese--no, and never would again. So she told herself as she let them run\r\ninto her heart to be stored among the treasures there. She believed in\r\nhis love--believed in it now with all her might. (Who, indeed, would\r\nnot?) She could not demean herself now by striving to belittle it or\r\ndoubt its continuance, as she had in Boston. He was young, yes; but he\r\nwould never be any older than this, could never love again like this. So\r\nmuch was given her, ought she not to be content? Could she expect more?\r\n\r\nShe understood Isaac Worthington, now, as well as his son understood him.\r\nShe knew that, if she were to yield to Bob Worthington, his father would\r\ndisown and disinherit him. She looked ahead into the years as a woman\r\nwill, and allowed herself for the briefest of moments to wonder whether\r\nany happiness could thrive in spite of the violence of that schism--any\r\nhappiness for him. She would be depriving him of his birthright, and it\r\nmay be that those who are born without birthrights often value them the\r\nmost. Cynthia saw these things, and more, for those who sit at the feet\r\nof sorrow soon learn the world's ways. She saw herself pointed out as the\r\nwoman whose designs had beggared and ruined him in his youth, and\r\n(agonizing and revolting thought!) the name of one would be spoken from\r\nwhom she had learned such craft. Lest he see the scalding tears in her\r\neyes, she turned away and conquered them. What could she do? Where should\r\nshe hide her love that it might not be seen of men? And how, in truth,\r\ncould she tell him these things?\r\n\r\n\"Cynthia,\" he went on, seeing that she did not answer, and taking heart,\r\n\"I will not say a word against my father. I know you would not respect me\r\nif I did. We are different, he and I, and find happiness in different\r\nways.\" Bob wondered if his father had ever found it. \"If I had never met\r\nyou and loved you, I should have refused to lead the life my father\r\nwishes me to lead. It is not in me to do the things he will ask. I shall\r\nhave to carve out my own life, and I feel that I am as well able to do it\r\nas he was. Percy Broke, a classmate of mine and my best friend, has a\r\nposition for me in a locomotive works in which his father is largely\r\ninterested.  We are going in together, the day after we graduate; it is\r\nall arranged, and his father has agreed. I shall work very hard, and in a\r\nfew years, Cynthia, we shall be together, never to part again. Oh,\r\nCynthia,\" he cried, carried away by the ecstasy of this dream which he\r\nhad, summoned up, \"why do you resist me? I love you as no man has ever\r\nloved,\" he exclaimed, with scornful egotism and contempt of those who had\r\nmade the world echo with that cry through the centuries, \"and you love\r\nme! Ah, do you think I do not see it--cannot feel it? You love me--tell\r\nme so.\"\r\n\r\nHe was coming toward her, and how was she to prevent his taking her by\r\nstorm? That was his way, and well she knew it. In her dreams she had felt\r\nherself lifted and borne off, breathless in his arms, to Elysium. Her\r\nbreath was going now, her strength was going, and yet she made him pause\r\nby the magic of a word. A concession was in that word, but one could not\r\nstruggle so piteously and concede nothing.\r\n\r\n\"Bob,\" she said, \"do you love me?\"\r\n\r\nLove her! If there was a love that acknowledged no bounds, that was\r\nconfined by no superlatives, it was his. He began to speak, but she\r\ninterrupted him with a wild passion that was new to her. As he sat in the\r\ntrain on his way back to Cambridge through the darkening afternoon, the\r\nnote of it rang in his ears and gave him hope--yes, and through many\r\nmonths afterward.\r\n\r\n\"If you love me I beg, I implore, I beseech you in the name of that\r\nlove--for your, sake and my sake, to leave me. Oh, can you not see why\r\nyou must go?\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped, even as he had before in the parlor in Mount Vernon Street.\r\nHe could but stop in the face of such an appeal--and yet the blood beat\r\nin his head with a mad joy.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me that you love me,--once,\" he cried,--\"once, Cynthia.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do-do not ask me,\" she faltered. \"Go.\"\r\n\r\nHer words were a supplication, not a command. And in that they were a\r\nsupplication he had gained a victory. Yes, though she had striven with\r\nall her might to deny, she had bade him hope. He left her without so much\r\nas a touch of the hand, because she had wished it. And yet she loved him!\r\nIncredible fact! Incredible conjury which made him doubt that his feet\r\ntouched the snow of Brampton Street, which blotted, as with a golden\r\nglow, the faces and the houses of Brampton from his sight. He saw no one,\r\nthough many might have accosted him. That part of him which was clay,\r\nwhich performed the menial tasks of his being, had kindly taken upon\r\nitself to fetch his bag from the house to the station, and to board the\r\ntrain.\r\n\r\nAh, but Brampton had seen him!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nGreat events, like young Mr. Worthington's visit to Brampton, are all\r\nvery well for a while, but they do not always develop with sufficient\r\nrapidity to satisfy the audiences of the drama. Seven days were an\r\ninterlude quite long enough in which to discuss every phase and bearing\r\nof this opening scene, and after that the play in all justice ought to\r\nmove on. But there it halted--for a while--and the curtain obstinately\r\nrefused to come up. If the inhabitants of Brampton had only known that\r\nthe drama, when it came, would be well worth waiting for, they might have\r\nbeen less restless.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to enrich the pages of this folio with all the\r\nfootnotes and remarks of, the sages of Brampton. These can be condensed\r\ninto a paragraph of two--and we can ring up the curtain when we like on\r\nthe next scene, for which Brampton had to wait considerably over a month.\r\nThere is to be no villain in this drama with the face of an Abbe Maury\r\nlike the seven cardinal sins. Comfortable looking Mr. Dodd of the\r\nprudential committee, with his chin-tuft of yellow beard, is cast for the\r\npart of the villain, but will play it badly; he would have been better\r\nsuited to a comedy part.\r\n\r\nYoung Mr. Worthington left Brampton on the five o'clock train, and at six\r\nMr. Dodd met his fellow-member of the committee, Judge Graves.\r\n\r\n\"Called a meetin'?\" asked Mr. Dodd, pulling the yellow tuft.\r\n\r\n\"What for?\" said the judge, sharply.\r\n\r\n\"What be you a-goin' to do about it?\" said Mr. Dodd.\r\n\r\n\"Do about what?\" demanded the judge, looking at the hardware dealer from\r\nunder his eyebrows.\r\n\r\nMr. Dodd knew well enough that this was not ignorance on the part of Mr.\r\nGraves, whose position in the matter dad been very well defined in the\r\ntwo sentences he had spoken. Mr. Dodd perceived that the judge was trying\r\nto get him to commit himself, and would then proceed to annihilate him.\r\nHe, Levi Dodd, had no intention of walking into such a trap.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said he, with a final tug at the tuft, \"if that's the way you\r\nfeel about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Feel about what?\" said the judge, fiercely.\r\n\r\n\"Callate you know best,\" said Mr. Dodd, and passed on up the street. But\r\nhe felt the judge's gimlet eyes boring holes in his back. The judge's\r\nposition was very fine, no doubt for the judge. All of which tends to\r\nshow that Levi Dodd had swept his mind, and that it was ready now for the\r\nreception of an opinion.\r\n\r\nSix weeks or more, as has been said, passed before the curtain rose\r\nagain, but the snarling trumpets of the orchestra played a fitting\r\nprelude. Cynthia's feelings and Cynthia's life need not be gone into\r\nduring this interval knowing her character, they may well be imagined.\r\nThey were trying enough, but Brampton had no means of guessing them.\r\nDuring the weeks she came and went between the little house and the\r\nlittle school, putting all the strength that was in her into her duties.\r\nThe Prudential Committee, which sometimes sat on the platform, could find\r\nno fault with the performance of these duties, or with the capability of\r\nthe teacher, and it is not going too far to state that the children grew\r\nto love her better than Miss Goddard had been loved. It may be declared\r\nthat children are the fittest citizens of a republic, because they are\r\napt to make up their own minds on any subject without regard to public\r\nopinion. It was so with the scholars of Brampton village lower school:\r\nthey grew to love the new teacher, careless of what the attitude of their\r\nelders might be, and some of them could have been seen almost any day\r\nwalking home with her down the street.\r\n\r\nAs for the attitude of the elders--there was none. Before assuming one\r\nthey had thought it best, with characteristic caution, to await the next\r\nact in the drama. There were ladies in Brampton whose hearts prompted\r\nthem, when they called on the new teacher, to speak a kindly word of\r\nwarning and advice; but somehow, when they were seated before her in the\r\nlittle sitting room of the John Billings house, their courage failed\r\nthem. There was something about this daughter of the Coniston storekeeper\r\nand ward of Jethro Bass that made them pause. So much for the ladies of\r\nBrampton. What they said among themselves would fill a chapter, and more.\r\n\r\nThere was, at this time, a singular falling-off in the attendance of the\r\nBrampton Club. Ephraim sat alone most of the day in his Windsor chair by\r\nthe stove, pretending to read newspapers. But he did not mention this\r\nfact to Cynthia. He was more lonesome than ever on the Saturdays and\r\nSundays which she spent with Jethro Bass.\r\n\r\nJethro Bass! It is he who might be made the theme of the music of the\r\nsnarling trumpets. What was he about during those six weeks? That is what\r\nthe state at large was beginning to wonder, and the state at large was\r\nlooking on at a drama, too. A rumor reached the capital and radiated\r\nthence to every city and town and hamlet, and was followed by other\r\nrumors like confirmations. Jethro Bass, for the first time in a long life\r\nof activity, was inactive: inactive, too, at this most critical period of\r\nhis career, the climax of it, with a war to be waged which for bitterness\r\nand ferocity would have no precedent; with the town meetings at hand,\r\nwhere the frontier fighting was to be done, and no quarter given.\r\nLieutenants had gone to Coniston for further orders and instructions, and\r\nhad come back without either. Achilles was sulking in the tannery\r\nhouse--some said a broken Achilles. Not a word could be got out of him,\r\nor the sign of an intention. Jake Wheeler moped through the days in Rias\r\nRichardson's store, too sore at heart to speak to any man, and could have\r\nwept if tears had been a relief to him. No more blithe errands over the\r\nmountain to Clovelly and elsewhere, though Jake knew the issue now and\r\nitched for the battle, and the vassals of the hill-Rajah under a jubilant\r\nBijah Bixby were arming cap-a-pie. Lieutenant-General-and-Senator Peleg\r\nHartington of Brampton, in his office over the livery stable, shook his\r\nhead like a mournful stork when questioned by brother officers from afar.\r\nOperations were at a standstill, and the sinews of war relaxed. Rural\r\ngivers of mortgages, who had not had the opportunity of selling them or\r\nhad feared to do so, began (mirabile dictu) to express opinions. Most\r\nominous sign of all--the proprietor of the Pelican Hotel had confessed\r\nthat the Throne Room had not been engaged for the coming session.\r\n\r\nWas it possible that Jethro Bass lay crushed under the weight of the\r\naccusations which had been printed, and were still being printed, in the\r\nNewcastle Guardian? He did not answer them, or retaliate in other\r\nnewspapers, but Jethro Bass had never made use of newspapers in this way.\r\nStill, nothing ever printed about him could be compared with those\r\narticles. Had remorse suddenly overtaken him in his old age? Such were\r\nthe questions people we're asking all over the state--people, at least,\r\nwho were interested in politics, or in those operations which went by the\r\nname of politics: yes, and many private citizens--who had participated in\r\npolitics only to the extent of voting for such candidates as Jethro in\r\nhis wisdom had seen fit to give them, read the articles and began to say\r\nthat boss domination was at an end. A new era was at hand, which they\r\nfondly (and very properly) believed was to be a golden era. It was,\r\nindeed, to be a golden era--until things got working; and then the gold\r\nwould cease. The Newcastle Guardian, with unconscious irony, proclaimed\r\nthe golden era; and declared that its columns, even in other days and\r\nunder other ownership, had upheld the wisdom of Jethro Bass. And he was\r\nstill a wise man, said the Guardian, for he had had sense enough to give\r\nup the fight.\r\n\r\nHad he given up the fight? Cynthia fervently hoped and prayed that he\r\nhad, but she hoped and prayed in silence. Well she knew, if the event in\r\nthe tannery shed had not made him abandon his affairs, no appeal could do\r\nso. Her happiest days in this period were the Saturdays and Sundays spent\r\nwith him in Coniston, and as the weeks went by she began to believe that\r\nthe change, miraculous as it seemed, had indeed taken place. He had given\r\nup his power. It was a pleasure that made the weeks bearable for her.\r\nWhat did it matter--whether he had made the sacrifice for the sake of his\r\nlove for her? He had made it.\r\n\r\nOn these Saturdays and Sundays they went on long drives together over the\r\nhills, while she talked to him of her life in Brampton or the books she\r\nwas reading, and of those she had chosen for him to read. Sometimes they\r\ndid not turn homeward until the delicate tracery of the branches on the\r\nsnow warned them of the rising moon. Jethro was often silent for hours at\r\na time, but it seemed to Cynthia that it was the silence of peace--of a\r\npeace he had never known before. There came no newspapers to the tannery\r\nhouse now: during the mid-week he read the books of which she had spoken\r\nWilliam Wetherell's books; or sat in thought, counting, perhaps; the days\r\nuntil she should come again. And the boy of those days for him was more\r\npathetic than much that is known to the world as sorrow.\r\n\r\nAnd what did Coniston think? Coniston, indeed, knew not what to think,\r\nwhen, little by little, the great men ceased to drive up to the door of\r\nthe tannery house, and presently came no more. Coniston sank then from\r\nits proud position as the real capital of the state to a lonely hamlet\r\namong the hills. Coniston, too, was watching the drama, and had had a\r\nbetter view of the stage than Brampton, and saw some reason presently for\r\nthe change in Jethro Bass. Not that Mr. Satterlee told, but such evidence\r\nwas bound, in the end, to speak for itself. The Newcastle Guardian had\r\nbeen read and debated at the store--debated with some heat by Chester\r\nPerkins and other mortgagors; discussed, nevertheless, in a political\r\nrather than a moral light. Then Cynthia had returned home; her face had\r\nawed them by its sorrow, and she had begun to earn her own living. Then\r\nthe politicians had ceased to come. The credit belongs to Rias Richardson\r\nfor hawing been the first to piece these three facts together, causing\r\nhim to burn his hand so severely on the stove that he had to carry it\r\nbandaged in soda for a week. Cynthia Wetherell had reformed Jethro.\r\n\r\nThough the village loved and revered Cynthia, Coniston as a whole did not\r\nrejoice in that reform. The town had fallen from its mighty estate, and\r\nthere were certain envious ones who whispered that it had remained for a\r\nyoung girl who had learned city ways to twist Jethro around her finger;\r\nthat she had made him abandon his fight with Isaac D. Worthington because\r\nMr. Worthington had a son--but there is no use writing such scandal.\r\nStripped of his power--even though he stripped himself--Jethro began to\r\nlose their respect, a trait tending to prove that the human race may have\r\nhad wolves for ancestors as well as apes. People had small opportunity,\r\nhowever, of showing a lack of respect to his person, for in these days he\r\nnoticed no one and spoke to none.\r\n\r\nWhen the lion is crippled, the jackals begin to range. A jackal\r\nreconnoitered the lair to see how badly the lion was crippled, and\r\nconceived with astounding insolence the plan of capturing the lion's\r\nquarry. This jackal, who was an old one, well knew how to round up a\r\nquarry, and fled back over the hills to consult with a bigger jackal, his\r\nmaster. As a result, two days before March town-meeting day, Mr. Bijah\r\nBixby paid a visit to the Harwich bank and went among certain Coniston\r\nfarmers looking over the sheep, his clothes bulging out in places when he\r\nbegan, and seemingly normal enough when he had finished. History repeats\r\nitself, even among lions and jackals. Thirty-six years before there had\r\nbeen a town-meeting in Coniston and a surprise. Established Church,\r\ndecent and orderly selectmen and proceedings had been toppled over that\r\nday, every outlying farm sending its representative through the sleet to\r\ndo it. And now retribution was at hand. This March-meeting day was mild,\r\nthe grass showing a green color on the south slopes where the snow had\r\nmelted, and the outlying farmers drove through mud-holes up to the axles.\r\nDrove, albeit, in procession along the roads, grimly enough, and the\r\nsheds Jock Hallowell had built around the meeting-house could not hold\r\nthe horses; they lined the fences and usurped the hitching posts of the\r\nvillage street, and still they came. Their owners trooped with muddy\r\nboots into the meeting-house, and when the moderator rapped for order the\r\nChairman of the Board of Selectmen, Jethro Bass, was not in his place;\r\nnever, indeed, would be there again. Six and thirty years he had been\r\nsupreme in that town--long enough for any man. The beams and king posts\r\nwould know him no more. Mr. Amos Cuthbert was elected Chairman, not\r\nwithout a gallant and desperate but unsupported fight of a minority led\r\nby Mr. Jake Wheeler, whose loyalty must be taken as a tribute to his\r\nspecies. Farmer Cuthbert was elected, and his mortgage was not\r\nforeclosed! Had it been, there was more money in the Harwich bank.\r\n\r\nThere was no telegraph to Coniston in these days, and so Mr. Sam Price,\r\nwith his horse in a lather, might have been seen driving with unseemly\r\nhaste toward Brampton, where in due time he arrived. Half an hour later\r\nthere was excitement at Newcastle, sixty-five miles away, in the office\r\nof the Guardian, and the next morning the excitement had spread over the\r\nwhole state.\r\n\r\nJethro Bass was dethroned in Coniston--discredited in his own town!\r\n\r\nAnd where was Jethro? Did his heart ache, did he bow his head as he\r\nthought of that supremacy, so hardly won, so superbly held, gone forever?\r\nMany were the curious eyes on the tannery house that day, and for days\r\nafter, but its owner gave no signs of concern. He read and thought and\r\nchopped wood in the tannery shed as usual. Never, I believe, did man,\r\nshorn of power, accept his lot more quietly. His struggle was over, his\r\nbattle was fought, a greater peace than he had ever thought to hope for\r\nwas won. For the opinion and regard of the world he had never cared. A\r\ngreater reward awaited him, greater than any knew--the opinion and regard\r\nand the praise of one whom he loved beyond all the world. On Friday she\r\ncame to him, on Friday at sunset, for the days were growing longer, and\r\nthat was the happiest sunset of his life. She said nothing as she raised\r\nher face to his and kissed him and clung to him in the little parlor, but\r\nhe knew, and he had his reward. So much for earthly power Cynthia brought\r\nthe little rawhide trunk this time, and came to Coniston for the March\r\nvacation--a happy two weeks that was soon gone. Happy by comparison, that\r\nis, with what they both had suffered, and a haven of rest after the\r\nstruggle and despair of the wilderness. The bond between them had, in\r\ntruth, never been stronger, for both the young girl and the old man had\r\ndenied themselves the thing they held most dear. Jethro had taken refuge\r\nand found comfort in his love. But Cynthia! Her greatest love had now\r\nbeen bestowed elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIf there were letters for the tannery house, Milly Skinner, who made it a\r\npoint to meet the stage, brought them. And there were letters during\r\nCynthia's sojourn,--many of them, bearing the Cambridge postmark. One\r\nevening it was Jethro who laid the letter on the table beside her as she\r\nsat under the lamp. He did not look at her or speak, but she felt that he\r\nknew her secret--felt that he deserved to have from her own lips what he\r\nhad been too proud--yes--and too humble to ask. Whose sympathy could she\r\nbe sure of, if not of his? Still she had longed to keep this treasure to\r\nherself. She took the letter in her hand.\r\n\r\n\"I do not answer them, Uncle Jethro, but--I cannot prevent his writing\r\nthem,\" she faltered. She did not confess that she kept them, every one,\r\nand read them over and over again; that she had grown, indeed, to look\r\nforward to them as to a sustenance. \"I--I do love him, but I will not\r\nmarry him.\"\r\n\r\nYes, she could be sure of Jethro's sympathy, though he could not express\r\nit in words. Yet she had not told him for this. She had told him, much as\r\nthe telling had hurt her, because she feared to cut him more deeply by\r\nher silence.\r\n\r\nIt was a terrible moment for Jethro, and never had he desired the gift of\r\nspeech as now. Had it not been for him; Cynthia might have been Robert\r\nWorthington's wife. He sat down beside her and put his hand over hers\r\nthat lay on the letter in her lap. It was the only answer he could make,\r\nbut perhaps it was the best, after all. Of what use were words at such a\r\ntime!\r\n\r\nFour days afterward, on a Monday morning, she went back to Brampton to\r\nbegin the new term.\r\n\r\nThat same Monday a circumstance of no small importance took place in\r\nBrampton--nothing less than the return, after a prolonged absence in the\r\nWest and elsewhere, of its first citizen. Isaac D. Worthington was again\r\nin residence. No bells were rung, indeed, and no delegation of citizens\r\nas such, headed by the selectmen, met him at the station; and other\r\nfeudal expressions of fealty were lacking. No staff flew Mr.\r\nWorthington's arms; nevertheless the lord of Brampton was in his castle\r\nagain, and Brampton felt that he was there. He arrived alone, wearing the\r\nsilk hat which had become habitual with him now, and stepping into his\r\nbarouche at the station had been driven up Brampton Street behind his\r\ngrays, looking neither to the right nor left. His reddish chop whiskers\r\nseemed to cling a little more closely to his face than formerly, and long\r\nyears of compression made his mouth look sterner than ever. A hawk-like\r\nman, Isaac Worthington, to be reckoned with and feared, whether in a\r\nfrock coat or in breastplate and mail.\r\n\r\nHis seneschal, Mr. Flint, was awaiting him in the library. Mr. Flint was\r\nlarge and very ugly, big-boned, smooth-shaven, with coarse features all\r\naskew, and a large nose with many excrescences, and thick lips. He was\r\nforty-two. From a foreman of the mills he had risen, step by step, to his\r\npresent position, which no one seemed able to define. He was, indeed, a\r\nseneschal. He managed the mills in his lord's absence, and--if the truth\r\nbe told--in his presence; knotty questions of the Truro Railroad were\r\nbrought to Mr. Flint and submitted to Mr. Worthington, who decided them,\r\nwith Mr. Flint's advice; and, within the last three months, Mr. Flint had\r\ninvaded the realm of politics, quietly, as such a man would, under the\r\ncover of his patron's name and glory. Mr. Flint it was who had bought the\r\nNewcastle Guardian, who went occasionally to Newcastle and spoke a few\r\neffective words now and then to the editor; and, if the truth will out,\r\nMr. Flint had largely conceived that scheme about the railroads which was\r\nto set Mr. Worthington on the throne of the state, although the scheme\r\nwas not now being carried out according to Mr. Flint's wishes. Mr. Flint\r\nwas, in a sense, a Bismarck, but he was not as yet all powerful.\r\nSometimes his august master or one of his fellow petty sovereigns would\r\nsweep Mr. Flint's plans into the waste basket, and then Mr. Flint would\r\nbe content to wait. To complete the character sketch, Mr. Flint was not\r\nabove hanging up his master's hat and coat, Which he did upon the present\r\noccasion, and went up to Mr. Worthington's bedroom to fetch a pocket\r\nhandkerchief out of the second drawer. He even knew where the\r\nhandkerchiefs were kept. Lucky petty sovereigns sometimes possess Mr.\r\nFlints to make them emperors.\r\n\r\nThe august personage seated himself briskly at his desk.\r\n\r\n\"So that scoundrel Bass is actually discredited at last,\" he said,\r\nblowing his nose in the pocket handkerchief Mr. Flint had brought him. \"I\r\nlose patience when I think how long we've stood the rascal in this state.\r\nI knew the people would rise in their indignation when they learned the\r\ntruth about him.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Flint did not answer this. He might have had other views.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder we did not think of it before,\" Mr. Worthington continued. \"A\r\nvery simple remedy, and only requiring a little courage and--and--\" (Mr.\r\nWorthington was going to say money, but thought better of it) \"and the\r\nchimera disappears. I congratulate you, Flint.\"\r\n\r\n\"Congratulate yourself,\" said Mr. Flint; \"that would not have been my\r\nway.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, I congratulate myself,\" said the august personage, who was in\r\ntoo good a humor to be put out by the rejection of a compliment. \"You\r\nremember what I said: the time was ripe, just publish a few biographical\r\narticles telling people what he was, and Jethro Bass would snuff out like\r\na candle. Mr. Duncan tells me the town-meeting results are very good all\r\nover the state. Even if we hadn't knocked out Jethro Bass, we'd have a\r\nfair majority for our bill in the next legislature.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know Bass's saying,\" answered Mr. Flint, \"You can hitch that kind of\r\na hoss, but they won't always stay hitched.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know, I know,\" said Mr. Worthington; \"don't croak, Flint. We can buy\r\nmore hitch ropes, if necessary. Well, what's the outlay up to the\r\npresent? Large, I suppose. Well, whatever it is, it's small compared to\r\nwhat we'll get for it.\" He laughed a little and rubbed his hands, and\r\nthen he remembered that capacity in which he stood before the world. Yes,\r\nand he stood before himself in the same capacity. Isaac Worthington may\r\nhave deceived himself, but he may or may not have been a hero to his\r\nseneschal. \"We have to fight fire with fire,\" he added, in a pained\r\nvoice. \"Let me see the account.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have tabulated the expense in the different cities and towns,\"\r\nanswered Mr. Flint; \"I will show you the account in a little while. The\r\nexpenses in Coniston were somewhat greater than the size of the town\r\njustified, perhaps. But Sutton thought--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" interrupted Mr. Worthington, \"if it had cost as much to carry\r\nConiston as Newcastle, it would have been worth it--for the moral effect\r\nalone.\"\r\n\r\nMoral effect! Mr. Flint thought of Mr. Bixby with his bulging pockets\r\ngoing about the hills, and smiled at the manner in which moral effects\r\nare sometimes obtained.\r\n\r\n\"Any news, Flint?\"\r\n\r\nNo news yet, Mr. Flint might have answered. In a few minutes there might\r\nbe news, and plenty of it, for it lay ready to be hatched under Mr.\r\nWorthington's eye. A letter in the bold and upright hand of his son was\r\non the top of the pile, placed there by Mr. Flint himself, who had\r\nexamined Mr. Worthington's face closely when he came in to see how much\r\nhe might know of its contents. He had decided that Mr. Worthington was in\r\ntoo good a humor to know anything of them. Mr. Flint had not steamed the\r\nletter open, and read the news; but he could guess at them pretty\r\nshrewdly, and so could have the biggest fool in Brampton. That letter\r\ncontained the opening scene of the next act in the drama.\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington cut the envelope and began to read, and while he did so\r\nMr. Flint, who was not afraid of man or beast, looked at him. It was a\r\nmanly and straight forward letter, and Mr. Worthington, no matter what\r\nhis opinions on the subject were, should have been proud of it. Bob\r\nannounced, first of all, that he was going to marry Cynthia Wetherell;\r\nthen he proceeded with praiseworthy self-control (for a lover) to\r\ndescribe Cynthia's character and attainments: after which he stated that\r\nCynthia had refused him--twice, because she believed that Mr. Worthington\r\nwould oppose the marriage, and had declared that she would never be the\r\ncause of a breach between father and son. Bob asked for his father's\r\nconsent, and hoped to have it, but he thought it only right to add that\r\nhe had given his word and his love, and did not mean to retract either.\r\nHe spoke of his visit to Brampton, and explained that Cynthia was\r\nteaching school there, and urged his father to see her before he made a\r\ndecision. Mr. Worthington read it through to the end, his lips closing\r\ntighter and tighter until his mouth was but a line across his face. There\r\nwas pain in the face, too, the kind of pain which anger sends, and which\r\ncomes with the tottering of a pride that is false. Of what gratification\r\nnow was the overthrow of Jethro Bass?\r\n\r\nHe stared at the letter for a moment after he had finished it, and his\r\nface grew a dark red. Then he seized the paper and tore it slowly,\r\ndeliberately, into bits.\r\n\r\nDudley Worthington was not thinking then--not he!--of the young man in\r\nthe white beaver who had called at the Social Library many years before\r\nto see a young woman whose name, too, had been Cynthia.--He was thinking,\r\nin fact, for he was a man to think in anger, whether it were not possible\r\nto remove this Cynthia from the face of the earth--at least to a place\r\nbeyond his horizon and that of his son. Had he worn the chain mail\r\ninstead of the frock coat he would have had her hung outside the town\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\n\"Good God!\" he exclaimed. And the words sounded profane indeed as he\r\nfixed his eyes upon Mr. Flint. \"You knew that Robert had been to\r\nBrampton.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Flint, \"the whole village knew it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good God!\" cried Mr. Worthington again, \"why was I not informed of this?\r\nWhy was I not warned of this? Have I no friends? Do you pretend to look\r\nafter my interests and not take the trouble to write me on such a\r\nsubject.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think I could have prevented it?\" asked Mr. Flint, very calmly.\r\n\r\n\"You allow this--this woman to come here to Brampton and teach school in\r\na place where she can further her designs? What were you about?\"\r\n\r\n\"When the prudential committee appointed her, nothing of this was known,\r\nMr. Worthington.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but now--now! What are you doing, what are they doing to allow her\r\nto remain? Who are on that committee?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Flint named the men. They had been reelected, as usual, at the recent\r\ntown-meeting. Mr. Errol, who had also been reelected, had returned but\r\nhad not yet issued the certificate or conducted the examination.\r\n\r\n\"Send for them, have them here at once,\" commanded Mr. Worthington,\r\nwithout listening to this.\r\n\r\n\"If you take my advice, you will do nothing of the kind,\" said Mr. Flint,\r\nwho, as usual, had the whole situation at his fingers' ends. He had taken\r\nthe trouble to inform himself about the girl, and he had discovered,\r\nshrewdly enough, that she was the kind which might be led, but not\r\ndriven. If Mr. Flint's advice had been listened to, this story might have\r\nhad quite a different ending. But Mr. Flint had not reached the stage\r\nwhere his advice was always listened to, and he had a maddened man to\r\ndeal with now. At that moment, as if fate had determined to intervene,\r\nthe housemaid came into the room.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Dodd to see you, sir,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Show him in,\" shouted Mr. Worthington; \"show him in!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Dodd was not a man who could wait for a summons which he had felt in\r\nhis bones was coming. He was ordinarily, as we have seen, officious. But\r\nnow he was thoroughly frightened. He had seen the great man in the\r\nbarouche as he drove past the hardware store, and he had made up his mind\r\nto go up at once, and have it over with. His opinions were formed now, He\r\nput a smile on his face when he was a foot outside of the library door.\r\n\r\n\"This is a great pleasure, Mr. Worthington, a great pleasure, to see you\r\nback,\" he said, coming forward. \"I callated--\"\r\n\r\nBut the great man sat in his chair, and made no attempt to return the\r\ngreeting.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Dodd, I thought you were my friend,\" he said.\r\n\r\nMr. Dodd went all to pieces at this reception.\r\n\r\n\"So I be, Mr. Worthington--so I be,\" he cried. \"That's why I'm here now.\r\nI've b'en a friend of yours ever since I can remember--never fluctuated.\r\nI'd rather have chopped my hand off than had this happen--so I would. If\r\nI could have foreseen what she was, she'd never have had the place, as\r\nsure as my name's Levi Dodd.\"\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Dodd had taken the trouble to look at the seneschal's face, he\r\nwould have seen a well-defined sneer there.\r\n\r\n\"And now that you know what she is,\" cried Mr. Worthington, rising and\r\nsmiting the pile of letters on his desk, \"why do you keep her there an\r\ninstant?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Dodd stopped to pick up the letters, which had flown over the floor.\r\nBut the great man was now in the full tide of his anger.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind the letters,\" he shouted; \"tell me why you keep her there.\"\r\n\r\n\"We callated we'd wait and see what steps you'd like taken,\" said the\r\ntrembling townsman.\r\n\r\n\"Steps! Steps! Good God! What kind of man are you to serve in such a\r\nplace when you allow the professed ward of Jethro Bass--of Jethro Bass,\r\nthe most notoriously depraved man in this state, to teach the children of\r\nthis town. Steps! How soon can you call your committee together?\"\r\n\r\n\"Right away,\" answered Mr. Dodd, breathlessly. He would have gone on to\r\nexculpate himself, but Mr. Worthington's inexorable finger was pointing\r\nat the door.\r\n\r\n\"If you are a friend of mine,\" said that gentleman, \"and if you have any\r\nregard for the fair name of this town, you will do so at once.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Dodd departed precipitately, and Mr. Worthington began to pace the\r\nroom, clasping his hands now in front of him, now behind him, in his\r\nagony: repeating now and again various appellations which need not be\r\nprinted here, which he applied in turn to the prudential committee, to\r\nhis son, and to Cynthia Wetherell.\r\n\r\n\"I'll run her out of Brampton,\" he said at last.\r\n\r\n\"If you do,\" said Mr. Flint, who had been watching him apparently\r\nunmoved, \"you may have Jethro Bass on your back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jethro Bass?\" shouted Mr. Worthington, with a laugh that was not\r\npleasant to hear, \"Jethro Bass is as dead as Julius Caesar.\"\r\n\r\nIt was one thing for Mr. Dodd to promise so readily a meeting of the\r\ncommittee, and quite another to decide how he was going to get through\r\nthe affair without any more burns and scratches than were absolutely\r\nnecessary. He had reversed the usual order, and had been in the fire--now\r\nhe was going to the frying-pan. He stood in the street for some time,\r\npulling at his tuft, and then made his way to Mr. Jonathan Hill's feed\r\nstore. Mr. Hill was reading \"Sartor Resartus\" in his little office, the\r\ntemperature of which must have been 95, and Mr. Dodd was perspiring when\r\nhe got there.\r\n\r\n\"It's come,\" said Mr. Dodd, sententiously.\r\n\r\n\"What's come?\" inquired Mr. Hill, mildly.\r\n\r\n\"Isaac D.'s come, that's what,\" said Mr. Dodd. \"I hain't b'en sleepin'\r\nwell of nights, lately. I can't think what we was about, Jonathan,\r\nputtin' that girl in the school. We'd ought to've knowed she wahn't fit.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter with her?\" inquired Mr. Hill.\r\n\r\n\"Matter with her!\" exclaimed his fellow-committeeman, \"she lives with\r\nJethro Bass--she's his ward.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what of it?\" said Mr. Hill, who never bothered himself about\r\ngossip or newspapers, or indeed about anything not between the covers of\r\na book, except when he couldn't help it.\r\n\r\n\"Good God!\" exclaimed Mr. Dodd, \"he's the most notorious, depraved man in\r\nthe state. Hain't we got to look out for the fair name of Brampton?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hill sighed and closed his book.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he said; \"I'd hoped we were through with that. Let's go up and\r\nsee what Judge Graves says about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold on,\" said Mr. Dodd, seizing the feed dealer by the coat, \"we've got\r\nto get it fixed in our minds what we're goin' to do, first. We can't\r\nallow no notorious people in our schools. We've got to stand up to the\r\njedge, and tell him so. We app'inted her on his recommendation, you\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I like the girl,\" replied Mr. Hill. \"I don't think we ever had a better\r\nteacher. She's quiet, and nice appearin', and attends to her business.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Dodd pulled his tuft, and cocked his head.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Worthington holds a note of yours, don't he, Jonathan?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hill reflected. He said he thought perhaps Mr. Worthington did.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Dodd, \"I guess we might as well go along up to the jedge\r\nnow as any time.\"\r\n\r\nBut when they got there Mr. Dodd's knock was so timid that he had to\r\nrepeat it before the judge came to the door and peered at them over his\r\nspectacles.\r\n\r\n\"Well, gentlemen, what can I do for you?\" he asked, severely, though he\r\nknew well enough. He had not been taken by surprise many times during the\r\nlast forty years. Mr. Dodd explained that they wished a little meeting of\r\nthe committee. The judge ushered them into his bedroom, the parlor being\r\ntoo good for such an occasion.\r\n\r\n\"Now, gentlemen,\" said he, \"let us get down to business. Mr. Worthington\r\narrived here to-day, he has seen Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Dodd has seen Mr.\r\nHill. Mr. Worthington is a political opponent of Jethro Bass, and wishes\r\nMiss Wetherell dismissed. Mr. Dodd and Mr. Hill have agreed, for various\r\nreasons which I will spare you, that Miss Wetherell should be dismissed.\r\nHave I stated the case, gentlemen, or have I not?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Graves took off his spectacles and wiped them, looking from one to\r\nthe other of his very uncomfortable fellow-members. Mr. Hill did not\r\nattempt to speak; but Mr. Dodd, who was not sure now that this was not\r\nthe fire and the other the frying-pan, pulled at his tuft until words\r\ncame to him.\r\n\r\n\"Jedge,\" he said finally, \"I must say I'm a mite surprised. I must say\r\nyour language is unwarranted.\"\r\n\r\n\"The truth is never unwarranted,\" said the judge.\r\n\r\n\"For the sake of the fair name of Brampton,\" began Mr. Dodd, \"we cannot\r\nallow--\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Dodd,\" interrupted the judge, \"I would rather have Mr. Worthington's\r\narguments from Mr. Worthington himself, if I wanted them at all. There is\r\nno need of prolonging this meeting. If I were to waste my breath until\r\nsix o'clock, it would be no use. I was about to say that your opinions\r\nwere formed, but I will alter that, and say that your minds are fixed.\r\nYou are determined to dismiss Miss Wetherell. Is it not so?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish you'd hear me, Jedge,\" said Mr. Dodd, desperately.\r\n\r\n\"Will you kindly answer me yes or no to that question,\" said the judge;\r\n\"my time is valuable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if you put it that way, I guess we are agreed that she hadn't\r\nought to stay. Not that I've anything against her personally--\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said the judge, with a calmness that made them tremble. They\r\nhad never bearded him before. \"All right, you are two to one and no\r\ncertificate has been issued. But I tell you this, gentlemen, that you\r\nwill live to see the day when you will bitterly regret this injustice to\r\nan innocent and a noble woman, and Isaac D. Worthington will live to\r\nregret it. You may tell him I said so. Good day, gentlemen.\"\r\n\r\nThey rose.\r\n\r\n\"Jedge,\" began Mr. Dodd again, \"I don't think you've been quite fair with\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fair!\" repeated the judge, with unutterable scorn. \"Good day,\r\ngentlemen.\" And he slammed the door behind them.\r\n\r\nThey walked down the street some distance before either of them spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Goliah,\" said Mr. Dodd, at last, \"did you ever hear such talk? He's got\r\nthe drattedest temper of any man I ever knew, and he never callates to\r\nmake a mistake. It's a little mite hard to do your duty when a man talks\r\nthat way.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not sure we've done it,\" answered Mr. Hill.\r\n\r\n\"Not sure!\" ejaculated the hardware dealer, for he was now far enough\r\naway from the judge's house to speak in his normal tone, \"and she\r\nconnected with that depraved--\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold on,\" said Mr. Hill, with an astonishing amount of spirit for him,\r\n\"I've heard that before.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Dodd looked at him, swallowed the wrong way and began to choke.\r\n\r\n\"You hain't wavered, Jonathan?\" he said, when he got his breath.\r\n\r\n\"No, I haven't,\" said Mr. Hill, sadly; \"but I wish to hell I had.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Dodd looked at him again, and began to choke again. It was the first\r\ntime he had known Jonathan Hill to swear.\r\n\r\n\"You're a-goin' to stick by what you agreed--by your principles?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to stick by my bread and butter,\" said Mr. Hill, \"not by my\r\nprinciples. I wish to hell I wasn't.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so saying that gentleman departed, cutting diagonally across the\r\nstreet through the snow, leaving Mr. Dodd still choking and pulling at\r\nhis tuft. This third and totally-unexpected shaking-up had caused him to\r\nfeel somewhat deranged internally, though it had not altered the opinions\r\nnow so firmly planted in his head. After a few moments, however, he had\r\ncollected himself sufficiently to move on once more, when he discovered\r\nthat he was repeating to himself, quite unconsciously, Mr. Hill's\r\nprofanity \"I wish to hell I wasn't.\" The iron mastiffs glaring at him\r\nangrily out of the snow banks reminded him that he was in front of Mr.\r\nWorthington's door, and he thought he might as well go in at once and\r\nreceive the great man's gratitude. He certainly deserved it. But as he\r\nput his hand on the bell Mr. Worthington himself came out of the house,\r\nand would actually have gone by without noticing Mr. Dodd if he had not\r\nspoken.\r\n\r\n\"I've got that little matter fixed, Mr. Worthington,\" he said, \"called\r\nthe committee, and we voted to discharge the--the young woman.\" No, he\r\ndid not deliver Judge Graves's message.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, Mr. Dodd,\" answered the great man, passing on so that Mr.\r\nDodd was obliged to follow him in order to hear, \"I'm glad you've come to\r\nyour senses at last. Kindly step into the library and tell Miss Bruce\r\nfrom me that she may fill the place to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certain,\" said Mr. Dodd, with his hand to his chin. He watched the great\r\nman turn in at his bank in the new block, and then he did as he was bid.\r\n\r\nBy the time school was out that day the news had leaped across Brampton\r\nStreet and spread up and down both sides of it that the new teacher had\r\nbeen dismissed. The story ran fairly straight--there were enough clews,\r\ncertainly. The great man's return, the visit of Mr. Dodd, the call on\r\nJudge Graves, all had been marked. The fiat of the first citizen had gone\r\nforth that the ward of Jethro Bass must be got rid of; the designing\r\nyoung woman who had sought to entrap his son must be punished for her\r\namazing effrontery.\r\n\r\nCynthia came out of school happily unaware that her name was on the lips\r\nof Brampton: unaware, too, that the lord of the place had come into\r\nresidence that day. She had looked forward to living in the same town\r\nwith Bob's father as an evil which was necessary to be borne, as one of\r\nthe things which are more or less inevitable in the lives of those who\r\nhave to make their own ways in the world. The children trooped around\r\nher, and the little girls held her hand, and she talked and laughed with\r\nthem as she came up the street in the eyes of Brampton,--came up the\r\nstreet to the block of new buildings where the bank was. Stepping out of\r\nthe bank, with that businesslike alertness which characterized him, was\r\nthe first citizen--none other. He found himself entangled among the\r\nromping children and--horror of horrors he bumped into the schoolmistress\r\nherself! Worse than this, he had taken off his hat and begged her pardon\r\nbefore he looked at her and realized the enormity of his mistake. And the\r\nschoolmistress had actually paid no attention to him, but with merely\r\nheightened color had drawn the children out of his way and passed on\r\nwithout a word. The first citizen, raging inwardly, but trying to appear\r\nunconcerned, walked rapidly back to his house. On the street of his own\r\ntown, before the eyes of men, he had been snubbed by a school-teacher.\r\nAnd such a schoolteacher!\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington, as he paced his library burning with the shame of this\r\noccurrence, remembered that he had had to glance at her twice before it\r\ncame over him who she was. His first sensation had been astonishment. And\r\nnow, in spite of his bitter anger, he had to acknowledge that the face\r\nhad made an impression on him--a fact that only served to increase his\r\nrage. A conviction grew upon him that it was a face which his son, or any\r\nother man, would not be likely to forget. He himself could not forget it.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Cynthia had reached her home, her cheeks still smarting,\r\nconscious that people had stared at her. This much, of course, she\r\nknew--that Brampton believed Bob Worthington to be in love with her: and\r\nthe knowledge at such times made her so miserable that the thought of\r\nJethro's isolation alone deterred her from asking Miss Lucretia Penniman\r\nfor a position in Boston. For she wrote to Miss Lucretia about her life\r\nand her reading, as that lady had made her promise to do. She sat down\r\nnow at the cherry chest of drawers that was also a desk, to write: not to\r\npour out her troubles, for she never had done that,--but to calm her mind\r\nby drawing little character sketches of her pupils. But she had only\r\nwritten the words, \"My dear Miss Lucretia,\" when she looked out of the\r\nwindow and saw Judge Graves coming up the path, and ran to open the door\r\nfor him.\r\n\r\n\"How do you do, Judge?\" she said, for she recognized Mr. Graves as one of\r\nher few friends in Brampton. \"I have sent to Boston for the new reader,\r\nbut it has not come.\"\r\n\r\nThe judge took her hand and pressed it and led her into the little\r\nsitting room. His face was very stern, but his eyes, which had flung fire\r\nat Mr. Dodd, looked at her with a vast compassion. Her heart misgave her.\r\n\r\n\"My dear,\" he said,--it was long since the judge had called any woman \"my\r\ndear,\"--\"I have bad news for you. The committee have decided that you\r\ncannot teach any longer in the Brampton school.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Judge,\" she answered, trying to force back the tears which would\r\ncome, \"I have tried so hard. I had begun to believe that I could fill the\r\nplace.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fill the place!\" cried the judge, startling her with his sudden anger.\r\n\"No woman in the state can fill it better than you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why am I dismissed?\" she asked breathlessly.\r\n\r\nThe judge looked at her in silence, his blue lips quivering. Sometimes\r\neven he found it hard to tell the truth. And yet he had come to tell it,\r\nthat she might suffer less. He remembered the time when Isaac D.\r\nWorthington had done him a great wrong.\r\n\r\n\"You are dismissed,\" he said, \"because Mr. Worthington has come home, and\r\nbecause the two other members of the committee are dogs and cowards.\" Mr.\r\nGraves never minced matters when he began, and his voice shook with\r\npassion. \"If Mr. Errol had examined you, and you had your certificate, it\r\nmight have been different. Errol is not a sycophant. Worthington does not\r\nhold his mortgage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mortgage!\" exclaimed Cynthia. The word always struck terror to her soul.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Worthington holds Mr. Hill's mortgage,\" said Mr. Graves, more than\r\never beside himself at the sight of her suffering. \"That man's tyranny is\r\nnot to be borne. We will not give up, Cynthia. I will fight him in this\r\nmatter if it takes my last ounce of strength, so help me God!\"\r\n\r\nMortgage! Cynthia sank down in the chair by the desk. In spite of the\r\nmisery the news had brought, the thought that his father, too, who was\r\nfighting Jethro Bass as a righteous man, dealt in mortgages and coerced\r\nmen to do his will, was overwhelming. So she sat for a while staring at\r\nthe landscape on the old wall paper.\r\n\r\n\"I will go to Coniston to-night,\" she said at last.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" cried the judge, seizing her shoulder in his excitement, \"no. Do\r\nyou think that I have been your friend--that I am your friend?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Judge Graves--\"\r\n\r\n\"Then stay here, where you are. I ask it as a favor to me. You need not\r\ngo to the school to-morrow--indeed, you cannot. But stay here for a day\r\nor two at least, and if there is any justice left in a free country, we\r\nshall have it. Will you stay, as a favor to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will stay, since you ask it,\" said Cynthia. \"I will do what you think\r\nright.\"\r\n\r\nHer voice was firmer than he expected--much firmer. He glanced at her\r\nquickly, with something very like admiration in his eye.\r\n\r\n\"You are a good woman, and a brave woman,\" he said, and with this\r\nsomewhat surprising tribute he took his departure instantly.\r\n\r\nCynthia was left to her thoughts, and these were harassing and sorrowful\r\nenough. One idea, however, persisted through them all. Mr. Worthington,\r\nwhose power she had lived long enough in Brampton to know, was an unjust\r\nman and a hypocrite. That thought was both sweet and bitter: sweet, as a\r\nretribution; and bitter, because he was Bob's father. She realized, now,\r\nthat Bob knew these things, and she respected and loved him the more, if\r\nthat were possible, because he had refrained from speaking of them to\r\nher. And now another thought came, and though she put it resolutely from\r\nher, persisted. Was she not justified now in marrying him? The reasoning\r\nwas false, so she told herself. She had no right to separate Bob from his\r\nfather, whatever his father might be. Did not she still love Jethro Bass?\r\nYes, but he had renounced his ways. Her heart swelled gratefully as she\r\nspoke the words to herself, and she reflected that he, at least, had\r\nnever been a hypocrite.\r\n\r\nOf one thing she was sure, now. In the matter of the school she had right\r\non her side, and she must allow Judge Graves to do whatever he thought\r\nproper to maintain that right. If Isaac D. Worthington's character had\r\nbeen different, this would not have been her decision. Now she would not\r\nleave Brampton in disgrace, when she had done nothing to merit it. Not\r\nthat she believed that the judge would prevail against such mighty odds.\r\nSo little did she think so that she fell, presently, into a despondency\r\nwhich in all her troubles had not overtaken her--the despondency which\r\ncomes even to the pure and the strong when they feel the unjust strength\r\nof the world against them. In this state her eyes fell on the letter she\r\nhad started to Miss Lucretia Penniman, and in desperation she began to\r\nwrite.\r\n\r\nIt was a short letter, reserved enough, and quite in character. It was\r\nright that she should defend herself, which she did with dignity, saying\r\nthat she believed the committee had no fault to find with her duties, but\r\nthat Mr. Worthington had seen fit to bring influence to bear upon them\r\nbecause of her connection with Jethro Bass.\r\n\r\nIt was not the whole truth, but Cynthia could not bring herself to write\r\nof that other reason. At the end she asked, very simply, if Miss Lucretia\r\ncould find her something to do in Boston in case her dismissal became\r\ncertain. Then she put on her coat, and walked to the postoffice to post\r\nthe letter, for she resolved that there could be no shame without reason\r\nfor it. There was a little more color in her cheeks, and she held her\r\nhead high, preparing to be slighted. But she was not slighted, and got\r\nmore salutations, if anything, than usual. She was, indeed, in the right\r\nnot to hide her head, and policy alone would have forbade it, had Cynthia\r\nthought of policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nPublic opinion is like the wind--it bloweth where it listeth. It whistled\r\naround Brampton the next day, whirling husbands and wives apart, and\r\nfamilies into smithereens. Brampton had a storm all to itself--save for a\r\nsympathetic storm raging in Coniston--and all about a school-teacher.\r\n\r\nHad Cynthia been a certain type of woman, she would have had all the men\r\non her side and all of her own sex against her. It is a decided point to\r\nbe recorded in her favor that she had among her sympathizers as many\r\nwomen as men. But the excitement of a day long remembered in Brampton\r\nbegan, for her, when a score or more of children assembled in front of\r\nthe little house, tramping down the snow on the grass plots, shouting for\r\nher to come to school with them. Children give no mortgages, or keep no\r\nhardware stores.\r\n\r\nCynthia, trying to read in front of the fire, was all in a tremble at the\r\nsound of the high-pitched little voices she had grown to love, and she\r\nlonged to go out and kiss them, every one. Her nature, however, shrank\r\nfrom any act which might appear dramatic or sensational. She could not\r\nresist going to the window and smiling at them, though they appeared but\r\ndimly--little dancing figures in a mist. And when they shouted, the more\r\nshe shook her head and put her finger to her lips in reproof and vanished\r\nfrom their sight. Then they trooped sadly on to school, resolved to make\r\nmatters as disagreeable as possible for poor Miss Bruce, who had not\r\noffended in any way.\r\n\r\nTwo other episodes worthy of a place in this act of the drama occurred\r\nthat morning, and one had to do with Ephraim. Poor Ephraim! His way had\r\never been to fight and ask no questions, and in his journey through the\r\nworld he had gathered but little knowledge of it. He had limped home the\r\nnight before in a state of anger of which Cynthia had not believed him\r\ncapable, and had reappeared in the sitting room in his best suit of blue.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going, Cousin Eph?\" Cynthia had asked suspiciously.\r\n\r\n\"Never you mind, Cynthy.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I do mind,\" she said, catching hold of his sleeve. \"I won't let you\r\ngo until you confess.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm a-goin' to tell Isaac Worthington what I think of him, that's whar\r\nI'm a-goin',\" cried Ephraim \"what I always hev thought of him sence he\r\nsent a substitute to the war an' acted treasonable here to home talkin'\r\nag'in' Lincoln.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Cousin Eph, you mustn't,\" said Cynthia, clinging to him with all her\r\nstrength in her dismay. It had taken every whit of her influence to\r\npersuade him to relinquish his purpose. Cynthia knew very well that\r\nEphraim meant to lay hands on Mr. Worthington, and it would indeed have\r\nbeen a disastrous hour for the first citizen if the old soldier had ever\r\ngot into his library. Cynthia pointed out, as best she might, that it\r\nwould be an evil hour for her, too, and that her cause would be greatly\r\ninjured by such a proceeding; she knew very well that it would ruin\r\nEphraim, but he would not have listened to such an argument.\r\n\r\nThe next thing he wished to do was to go to Coniston and rouse Jethro.\r\nCynthia's heart stood still when he proposed this, for it touched upon\r\nher greatest fear,--which had impelled her to go to Coniston. But she had\r\nhoped and believed that Jethro, knowing her feelings, would do\r\nnothing--since for her sake he had chosen to give up his power. Now an\r\nacute attack of rheumatism had come to her rescue, and she succeeded in\r\ngetting Ephraim off to bed, swathed in bandages.\r\n\r\nThe next morning he had insisted upon hobbling away to the postoffice,\r\nwhere in due time he was discovered by certain members of the Brampton\r\nClub nailing to the wall a new engraving of Abraham Lincoln, and draping\r\nit with a little silk flag he had bought in Boston. By which it will be\r\nseen that a potion of the Club were coming back to their old haunt. This\r\nportion, it may be surmised, was composed of such persons alone as were\r\nlikely to be welcomed by the postmaster. Some of these had grievances\r\nagainst Mr. Worthington or Mr. Flint; others, in more prosperous\r\ncircumstances, might have been moved by envy of these gentlemen; still\r\nothers might have been actuated largely by righteous resentment at what\r\nthey deemed oppression by wealth and power. These members who came that\r\nmorning comprised about one-fourth of those who formerly had been in the\r\nhabit of dropping in for a chat, and their numbers were a fair indication\r\nof the fact that those who from various motives took the part of the\r\nschoolteacher in Brampton were as one to three.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to repeat their expressions of indignation and\r\nsympathy. There was a certain Mr. Gamaliel Ives in the town, belonging to\r\nan old Brampton family, who would have been the first citizen if that\r\nother first citizen had not, by his rise to wealth and power, so\r\ncompletely overshadowed him. Mr. Ives owned a small mill on Coniston\r\nWater below the town. He fairly bubbled over with civic pride, and he was\r\nan authority on all matters pertaining to Brampton's history. He knew\r\nthe \"Hymn to Coniston\" by heart. But we are digressing a little. Mr.\r\nIves, like that other Gamaliel of old, had exhorted his fellow-townsmen\r\nto wash their hands of the controversy. But he was an intimate of Judge\r\nGraves, and after talking with that gentleman he became a partisan\r\novernight; and when he had stopped to get his mail he had been lured\r\nbehind the window by the debate in progress. He was in the midst of some\r\nimpromptu remarks when he recognized a certain brisk step behind him, and\r\nIsaac D. Worthington himself entered the sanctum!\r\n\r\nIt must be explained that Mr. Worthington sometimes had an important\r\nletter to be registered which he carried to the postoffice with his own\r\nhands. On such occasions--though not a member of the Brampton Club--he\r\nwalked, as an overlord will, into any private place he chose, and\r\nrecognized no partitions or barriers. Now he handed the letter (addressed\r\nto a certain person in Cambridge, Massachusetts) to the postmaster.\r\n\r\n\"You will kindly register that and give me a receipt, Mr. Prescott,\" he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nEphraim turned from his contemplation of the features of the martyred\r\nPresident, and on his face was something of the look it might have worn\r\nwhen he confronted his enemies over the log-works at Five Forks. No, for\r\nthere was a vast contempt in his gaze now, and he had had no contempt for\r\nthe Southerners, and would have shaken hands with any of them the moment\r\nthe battle was over. Mr. Worthington, in spite of himself, recoiled a\r\nlittle before that look, fearing, perhaps, physical violence.\r\n\r\n\"I hain't a-goin' to hurt you, Mr. Worthington,\" Ephraim said, \"but I am\r\na-goin' to ask you to git out in front, and mighty quick. If you hev any\r\nbusiness with the postmaster, there's the window,\" and Ephraim pointed to\r\nit with his twisted finger. \"I don't allow nobody but my friends here,\r\nMr. Worthington, and people I respect.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington looked--well, eye-witnesses give various versions as to\r\nhow he looked. All agree that his lip trembled; some say his eyes\r\nwatered: at any rate, he quailed, stood a moment undecided, and then\r\nswung on his heel and walked to the partition door. At this safe distance\r\nhe turned.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Prescott,\" he said, his voice quivering with passion and perhaps\r\nanother emotion, \"I will make it my duty to report to the\r\npostmaster-general the manner in which this office is run. Instead of\r\nattending to your business, you make the place a resort for loafers and\r\nidlers. Good morning, sir.\"\r\n\r\nTen minutes later Mr. Flint himself came to register the letter. But it\r\nwas done at the window, and the loafers and idlers were still there.\r\n\r\nThe curtain had risen again, indeed, and the action was soon fast enough\r\nfor the most impatient that day. No sooner had the town heard with bated\r\nbreath of the expulsion of the first citizen from the inner sanctuary of\r\nthe post-office, than the news of another event began to go the rounds.\r\nMr. Worthington had other and more important things to think about than\r\nminor postmasters, and after his anger and--yes, and momentary fear had\r\nsubsided, he forgot the incident except to make a mental note to remember\r\nto deprive Mr. Prescott of his postmastership, which he believed could be\r\ndone readily enough now that Jethro Bass was out of the way. Then he had\r\nstepped into the bank, which he had come to regard as his own bank, as he\r\nregarded most institutions in Brampton. He had, in the old days, been\r\npresident of it, as we know. He stepped into the bank, and then--he\r\nstepped out again.\r\n\r\nMost people have experienced that sickly feeling of the diaphragm which\r\nsometimes comes from a sadden shock. Mr. Worthington had it now as he\r\nhurried up the street, and he presently discovered that he was walking in\r\nthe direction opposite to that of his own home. He crossed the street,\r\nmade a pretence of going into Mr. Goldthwaite's drug store, and hurried\r\nback again. When he reached his own library, he found Mr. Flint busy\r\nthere at his desk. Mr. Flint rose. Mr. Worthington sat down and began to\r\npull the papers about in a manner which betrayed to his seneschal (who\r\nknew every mood of his master) mental perturbation.\r\n\r\n\"Flint,\" he said at last, striving his best for an indifferent accent,\r\n\"Jethro Bass is here--I ran across him just now drawing money in the\r\nbank.\"\r\n\r\n\"I could have told you that this morning,\" answered Mr. Flint. \"Wheeler,\r\nwho runs errands for him in Coniston, drove him in this morning, and he's\r\nbeen with Peleg Hartington for two hours over Sherman's livery stable.\"\r\n\r\nAn interval of silence followed, during which Mr. Worthington shuffled\r\nwith his letters and pretended to read them.\r\n\r\n\"Graves has called a mass meeting to-night, I understand,\" he remarked in\r\nthe same casual way. \"The man's a demagogue, and mad as a loon. I believe\r\nhe sent back one of our passes once, didn't he? I suppose Bass has come\r\nin to get Hartington to work up the meeting. They'll be laughed out of\r\nthe town hall, or hissed out.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess you'll find Bass has come down for something else,\" said Mr.\r\nFlint, looking up from a division report.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" demanded Mr. Worthington, changing his attitude to\r\none of fierceness. But he was well aware that whatever tone he took with\r\nhis seneschal, he never fooled him.\r\n\r\n\"I mean what I told you yesterday,\" said Flint, \"that you've stirred up\r\nthe dragon.\"\r\n\r\nEven Mr. Flint did not know how like a knell his words sounded in Isaac\r\nWorthington's ears.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" he cried, \"you're talking nonsense, Flint. We maimed him too\r\nthoroughly for that. He hasn't power enough left to carry his own town.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said the seneschal.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\" said his master, with extreme irritation.\r\n\r\n\"I mean what I said yesterday, that we haven't maimed him at all. He had\r\nhis own reasons for going into his hole, and he never would have come out\r\nagain if you hadn't goaded him. Now he's out, and we'll have to step\r\naround pretty lively, I can tell you, or he'll maim us.\"\r\n\r\nAll of which goes to show that Mr. Flint had some notion of men and\r\naffairs. He became, as may be predicted, the head of many material things\r\nin later days, and he may sometime reappear in company with other\r\ncharacters in this story.\r\n\r\nThe sickly feeling in Mr. Worthington's diaphragm had now returned.\r\n\r\n\"I think you will find you are mistaken, Flint,\" he said, attempting\r\ndignity now. \"Very much mistaken.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said Flint, \"perhaps I am. But I believe you'll find he left\r\nfor the capital on the eleven o'clock, and if you take the trouble to\r\ninquire from Bedding you will probably learn that the Throne Room is\r\nbespoken for the session.\"\r\n\r\nAll of that which Mr, Flint had predicted turned out to be true. The\r\ndragon had indeed waked up. It all began with the news Milly Skinner had\r\ngot from the stage driver, imparted to Jethro as he sat reading about\r\nHiawatha. And terrible indeed had been that awakening. This dragon did\r\nnot bellow and roar and lash his tail when he was roused, but he stood\r\nup, and there seemed to emanate from him a fire which frightened poor\r\nMilly Skinner, upset though she was by the news of Cynthia's dismissal.\r\nO, wondrous and paradoxical might of love, which can tame the most\r\npowerful of beasts, and stir them again into furies by a touch!\r\n\r\nConiston was the first to tremble, as though the forces stretching\r\nthemselves in the tannery house were shaking the very ground, and the\r\nname of Jethro Bass took on once more, as by magic, a terrible meaning.\r\nWhen Vesuvius is silent, pygmies may make faces on the very lip of the\r\ncrater, and they on the slopes forget the black terror of the fiery hail.\r\nJake Wheeler himself, loyal as he was, did not care to look into the\r\ncrater now that he was summoned; but a force pulled him all the way to\r\nthe tannery house. He left behind him an awe-stricken gathering at the\r\nstore, composed of inhabitants who had recently spoken slightingly of the\r\nvolcano.\r\n\r\nWe are getting a little mixed in our metaphors between lions and dragons\r\nand volcanoes, and yet none of them are too strong to represent Jethro\r\nBass when he heard that Isaac Worthington had had the teacher dismissed\r\nfrom Brampton lower school. He did not stop to reason then that action\r\nmight distress her. The beast in him awoke again; the desire for\r\nvengeance on a man whom he had hated most of his life, and who now had\r\ndared to cause pain to the woman whom he loved with all his soul, and\r\neven idolize, was too great to resist. He had no thought of resisting it,\r\nfor the waters of it swept over his soul like the Atlantic over a lost\r\ncontinent. He would crush Isaac Worthington if it took the last breath\r\nfrom his body.\r\n\r\nJake went to the tannery house and received his orders--orders of which\r\nhe made a great mystery afterward at the store, although they consisted\r\nsimply of directions to be prepared to drive Jethro to Brampton the next\r\nmorning. But the look of the man had frightened Jake. He had never seen\r\nvengeance so indelibly written on that face, and he had never before\r\nrealized the terrible power of vengeance. Mr. Wheeler returned from that\r\nmeeting in such a state of trepidation that he found it necessary to\r\naccompany Rias to a certain keg in the cellar; after which he found his\r\ntongue. His description of Jethro's appearance awed his hearers, and Jake\r\ndeclared that he would not be in Isaac Worthington's shoes for all of\r\nIsaac Worthington's money. There were others right here in Coniston, Jake\r\nhinted, who might now find it convenient to emigrate to the far West.\r\n\r\nJethro's face had not changed when Jake drove him out of Coniston the\r\nnext morning. Good Mr. Satterlee saw it, and felt that the visit he had\r\nwished to make would have been useless; Mr. Amos Cuthbert and Mr. Sam\r\nPrice saw it, from a safe distance within the store, and it is a fact\r\nthat Mr. Price seriously thought of taking Mr. Wheeler's advice about a\r\nresidence in the West; Mr. Cuthbert, of a sterner nature, made up his\r\nmind to be hung and quartered. A few minutes before Jethro walked into\r\nhis office over the livery stable, Senator Peleg Hartington would have\r\ndenied, with that peculiar and mournful scorn of which he was master,\r\nthat Jethro Bass could ever again have any influence over him. Peleg was,\r\nindeed, at that moment preparing, in his own way, to make overtures to\r\nthe party of Isaac D. Worthington. Jethro walked into the office, leaving\r\nJake below with Mr. Sherman; and Senator Hartington was very glad he had\r\nnot made the overtures. And when he accompanied Jethro to the station\r\nwhen he left for the capital, the senator felt that the eyes of men were\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\nAnd Cynthia? Happily, Cynthia passed the day in ignorance that Jethro had\r\ngone through Brampton. Ephraim, though he knew of it, did not speak of it\r\nwhen he came home to his dinner; Mr. Graves had called, and informed her\r\nof the meeting in the town hall that night.\r\n\r\n\"It is our only chance,\" he said obdurately, in answer to her protests.\r\n\"We must lay the case before the people of Brampton. If they have not the\r\ncourage to right the wrong, and force your reinstatement through public\r\nopinion, there is nothing more to be done.\"\r\n\r\nTo Cynthia, the idea of having a mass meeting concerning herself was\r\nparticularly repellent.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Judge Graves!\" she cried, \"if there isn't any other way, please drop\r\nthe matter. There are plenty of teachers who will--be acceptable to\r\neverybody.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cynthia,\" said the judge, \"I can understand that this publicity is very\r\npainful to you. I beg you to remember that we are contending for a\r\nprinciple. In such cases the individual must be sacrificed to the common\r\ngood.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I cannot go to the meeting--I cannot.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the judge; \"I don't think that will be necessary.\"\r\n\r\nAfter he was gone, she could think of nothing but the horror of having\r\nher name--yes, and her character--discussed in that public place; and it\r\nseemed to her, if she listened, she could hear a clatter of tongues\r\nthroughout the length of Brampton Street, and that she must fain stop her\r\nears or go mad. The few ladies who called during the day out of kindness\r\nor curiosity, or both, only added to her torture. She was not one who\r\ncould open her heart to acquaintances: the curious ones got but little\r\nsatisfaction, and the kind ones thought her cold, and they did not\r\nperceive that she was really grateful for their little attentions.\r\nGratitude, on such occasions, does not always consist in pouring out\r\none's troubles in the laps of visitors.\r\n\r\nSo the visitors went home, wondering whether it were worth while after\r\nall to interest themselves in the cause of such a self-contained and\r\nself-reliant young woman. In spite of all her efforts, Cynthia had never\r\nwholly succeeded in making most of the Brampton ladies believe that she\r\ndid not secretly deem herself above them. They belonged to a reserved\r\nrace themselves; but Cynthia had a reserve which was even different from\r\ntheir own.\r\n\r\nAs night drew on the predictions of Mr. Worthington seemed likely to be\r\nfulfilled, and it looked as if Judge Graves would have a useless bill to\r\npay for gas in the new town hall. The judge had never been a man who\r\ncould compel a following, and he had no magnetism with which to lead a\r\ncause: the town tradesmen, especially those in the new brick block, would\r\nbe chary as to risking the displeasure of their best customer. At\r\nhalf-past seven Mr. Graves: came in, alone, and sat on the platform\r\nstaring grimly at his gas. Is there a lecturer, or, a playwright, or a\r\npolitician, who has not, at one time or another, been in the judge's\r\nplace? Who cannot sympathize with him as he watched the thin and\r\nhesitating stream of people out of the corner of his eye as they came in\r\nat the door? The judge despised them with all his soul, but it is human\r\nnature not to wish to sit in a hall or a theatre that is three-quarters\r\nempty.\r\n\r\nAt sixteen minutes to eight a mild excitement occurred, an incident of\r\nsome significance which served to detain many waverers. Senator Peleg\r\nHartington walked up the aisle, and the judge rose and shook him by the\r\nhand, and as Deacon Hartington he was invited to sit on the platform. The\r\nsenator's personal influence was not to be ignored; and it had sufficed\r\nto carry his district in the last election against the Worthington\r\nforces, in spite of the abdication of Jethro Bass. Mr. Page, the editor\r\nof the Clarion, Senator Hartington's organ, was also on the platform. But\r\nwhere was Mr. Ives? Where was that Gamaliel who had been such a warm\r\npartisan in the postoffice that morning?\r\n\r\n\"Saw him outside the hall--wahn't but ten minutes ago,\" said Deacon\r\nHartington, sadly; \"thought he was a-comin' in.\"\r\n\r\nEight o'clock came, and no Mr. Ives; ten minutes past--fifteen minutes\r\npast. If the truth must be told, Mr. Ives had been on the very threshold\r\nof the hall, and one glance at the poor sprinkling of people there had\r\ndecided him. Mr. Ives had a natural aversion to being laughed at, and as\r\nhe walked back on the darker side of the street he wished heartily that\r\nhe had stuck to his original Gamaliel-advocacy of no interference, of\r\nallowing the Supreme Judge to decide. Such opinions were inevitably just,\r\nMr. Ives was well aware, though not always handed down immediately. If he\r\nwere to humble the first citizen, Mr. Ives reflected that a better\r\nopportunity might present itself. The whistle of the up-train served to\r\nstrengthen his resolution, for he was reminded thereby that his mill\r\noften had occasion to ask favors of the Truro Railroad.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime it was twenty minutes past eight in the town hall, and\r\nMr. Graves had not rapped for order. Deacon Hartington sat as motionless\r\nas a stork on the borders of a glassy lake at sunrise, the judge had\r\nbegun seriously to estimate the gas bill, and Mr. Page had chewed up the\r\nend of a pencil. There was one, at least, in the audience of whom the\r\njudge could be sure. A certain old soldier in blue sat uncompromisingly\r\non the front bench with his hands crossed over the head of his stick; but\r\nthe ladies and gentlemen nearest the door were beginning to vanish, one\r\nby one, silently as ghosts, when suddenly the judge sat up. He would have\r\nrubbed his eyes, had he been that kind of a man. Four persons had entered\r\nthe hall--he was sure of it--and with no uncertain steps as if frightened\r\nby its emptiness. No, they came boldly. And after them trooped others,\r\nand still others were heard in the street beyond, not whispering, but\r\ntalking in the unmistakable tones of people who had more coming behind\r\nthem. Yes, and more came. It was no illusion, or delusion: there they\r\nwere filling the hall as if they meant to stay, and buzzing with\r\nexcitement. The judge was quivering with excitement now, but he, too, was\r\nonly a spectator of the drama. And what a drama, with a miracle-play for\r\nBrampton!\r\n\r\nMr. Page rose from his chair and leaned over the edge of the platform\r\nthat something might be whispered in his ear. The news, whatever it was,\r\nwas apparently electrifying, and after the first shock he turned to\r\nimpart it to Mr. Graves; but turned too late, for the judge had already\r\nrapped for order and was clearing his throat. He could not account for\r\nthis extraordinary and unlooked-for audience, among whom he spied many\r\nwho had thought it wiser not to protest against the dictum of the first\r\ncitizen, and many who had professed to believe that the teacher's\r\nconnection with Jethro Bass was a good and sufficient reason for\r\ndismissal. The judge was prepared to take advantage of the tide, whatever\r\nits cause.\r\n\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he said, \"I take the liberty of calling this\r\nmeeting to order. And before a chairman be elected, I mean to ask your\r\nindulgence to explain my purposes in requesting the use of this hall\r\nto-night. In our system of government, the inalienable and most precious\r\ngift--\"\r\n\r\nWhatever the gift was, the judge never explained. He paused at the words,\r\nand repeated them, and stopped altogether because no one was paying any\r\nattention to him. The hall was almost full, the people had risen, with a\r\nhum, and as one man had turned toward the door. Mr. Gamaliel Ives was\r\ntriumphantly marching down the aisle, and with him was--well, another\r\nperson. Nay, personage would perhaps be the better word.\r\n\r\nLet us go back for a moment. There descended from that train of which we\r\nhave heard the whistle a lady with features of no ordinary moulding, with\r\ncurls and a string bonnet and a cloak that seemed strangely to harmonize\r\nwith the lady's character. She had the way of one in authority, and Mr.\r\nSherman himself ran to open the door of his only closed carriage, and the\r\ndriver galloped off with her all the way to the Brampton House. Once\r\nthere, the lady seized the pen as a soldier seizes the sword, and wrote\r\nher name in most uncompromising characters on the register, Miss Lucretia\r\nPenniman, Boston. Then she marched up to her room.\r\n\r\nMiss Lucretia Penniman, author of the \"Hymn to Coniston,\" in the\r\nreflected glory of whose fame Brampton had shone for thirty years! Whose\r\nname was lauded and whose poem was recited at every Fourth of July\r\ncelebration, that the very children might learn it and honor its\r\ncomposer! Stratford-on-Avon is not prouder of Shakespeare than Brampton\r\nof Miss Lucretia, and now she was come back, unheralded, to her\r\nbirthplace. Mr. Raines, the clerk, looked at the handwriting on the book,\r\nand would not believe his own sight until it was vouched for by sundry\r\ncitizens who had followed the lady from the station--on foot. And then\r\nthere was a to-do.\r\n\r\nSend for Mr. Gamaliel Ives; send for Miss Bruce, the librarian; send for\r\nMr. Page, editor of the Clarion, and notify the first citizen. He,\r\nindeed, could not be sent for, but had he known of her coming he would\r\nundoubtedly have had her met at the portals and presented with the keys\r\nin gold. Up and down the street flew the news which overshadowed and\r\nblotted out all other, and the poor little school-teacher was forgotten.\r\n\r\nOne of these notables was at hand, though he did not deserve to be. Mr.\r\nGamaliel Ives sent up his card to Miss Lucretia, and was shown\r\ndeferentially into the parlor, where he sat mopping his brow and growing\r\nhot and cold by turns. How would the celebrity treat him? The celebrity\r\nherself answered the question by entering the room in such stately manner\r\nas he had expected, to the rustle of the bombazine. Whereupon Mr. Ives\r\nbounced out of his chair and bowed, though his body was not formed to\r\nbend that way.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Penniman,\" he exclaimed, \"what an honor for Brampton! And what a\r\npleasure, the greater because so unexpected! How cruel not to have given\r\nus warning, and we could have greeted you as your great fame deserves!\r\nYou could never take time from your great duties to accept the\r\ninvitations of our literary committee, alas! But now that you are here,\r\nyou will find a warm welcome, Miss Penniman. How long it has been--thirty\r\nyears,--you see I know it to a day, thirty years since you left us.\r\nThirty years, I may say, we have kept burning the vestal fire in your\r\nworship, hoping for this hour.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Lucretia may have had her own ideas about the propriety of the\r\nreference to the vestal fire.\r\n\r\n\"Gamaliel,\" she said sharply, \"straighten up and don't talk nonsense to\r\nme. I've had you on my knee, and I knew your mother and father.\"\r\n\r\nGamaliel did straighten up, as though Miss Lucretia had applied a lump of\r\nice to the small of his back. So it is when the literary deities, vestal\r\nor otherwise, return to their Stratfords. There are generally surprises\r\nin store for the people they have had on their knees, and for others.\r\n\r\n\"Gamaliel,\" said Miss Lucretia, \"I want to see the prudential committee\r\nfor the village district.\"\r\n\r\n\"The prudential committee!\" Mr. Ives fairly shrieked the words in his\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n\"I tried to speak plainly,\" said Miss Lucretia. \"Who are on that\r\ncommittee?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ezra Graves,\" said Mr. Ives, as though mechanically compelled, for his\r\nhead was spinning round. \"Ezra Graves always has run it, until now. But\r\nhe's in the town hall.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's he doing there?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Ives was no fool. Some inkling of the facts began to shoot through\r\nhis brain, and he saw his chance.\r\n\r\n\"He called a mass meeting to protest against the dismissal of a teacher.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gamaliel,\" said Miss Lucretia, \"you will conduct me to that meeting. I\r\nwill get my cloak.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Ives wasted no time in the interval, and he fairly ran out into the\r\noffice. Miss Lucretia Penniman was in town, and would attend the mass\r\nmeeting. Now, indeed, it was to be a mass meeting. Away flew the tidings,\r\nbroadcast, and people threw off their carpet slippers and dressing gowns,\r\nand some who had gone to bed got up again. Mr. Dodd heard it, and changed\r\nhis shoes three times, and his intentions three times three. Should he\r\ngo, or should he not? Already he heard in imagination the first distant\r\nnote of the populace, and he was not of the metal to defend a Bastille or\r\na Louvre for his royal master with the last drop of his blood.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Gamaliel Ives was conducting Miss Lucretia toward, the\r\ntown hall, and speaking in no measured tones of indignation of the\r\ncringing, truckling qualities of that very Mr. Dodd. The injustice to\r\nMiss Wetherell, which Mr. Ives explained as well as he could, made his\r\nblood boil: so he declared.\r\n\r\nAnd note we are back again at the meeting, when the judge, with his hand\r\non his Adam's apple, is pronouncing the word \"gift.\" Mr. Ives is\r\ntriumphantly marching down the aisle, escorting the celebrity of Brampton\r\nto the platform, and quite aware of the heart burnings of his\r\nfellow-citizens on the benches. And Miss Lucretia, with that stern\r\ncomposure with which celebrities accept public situations, follows up the\r\nsteps as of right and takes the chair he assigns her beside the chairman.\r\nThe judge, still grasping his Adam's apple, stares at the newcomer in\r\namazement, and recognizes her in spite of the years, and trembles. Miss\r\nLucretia Penniman! Blucher was not more welcome to Wellington, or\r\nLafayette to Washington, than was Miss Lucretia to Ezra Graves as he\r\nturned his back on the audience and bowed to her deferentially. Then he\r\nturned again, cleared his throat once more to collect his senses, and was\r\nabout to utter the familiar words, \"We have with us tonight,\" when they\r\nwere taken out of his mouth--taken out of his mouth by one who had in all\r\nconscience stolen enough thunder for one man,--Mr. Gamaliel Ives.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Chairman,\" said Mr. Ives, taking a slight dropping of the judge's\r\nlower jaw for recognition, \"and ladies and gentlemen of Brampton. It is\r\nour great good fortune to have with us to-night, most unexpectedly, one\r\nof whom Brampton is, and for many years has been, justly proud.\"\r\n(Cheers.) \"One whose career Brampton has followed with a mother's eyes\r\nand with a mother's heart. One who has chosen a broader field for the\r\nexercise of those great powers with which Nature endowed her than\r\nBrampton could give. One who has taken her place among the luminaries of\r\nliterature of her time.\" (Cheers.) \"One who has done more than any other\r\nwoman of her generation toward the uplifting of the sex which she\r\nhonors.\" (Cheers and clapping of hands.) \"And one who, though her lot has\r\nfallen among the great, has not forgotten the home of her childhood. For\r\nhas she not written those beautiful lines which we all know by heart?\r\n\r\n     'Ah, Coniston! Thy lordly form I see\r\n     Before mine eyes in exile drear.'\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Chairman and fellow-townsmen and women, I have the extreme honor of\r\nintroducing to you one whom we all love and revere, the author of the\r\n'Hymn to Coniston,' the editor of the Woman's Hour, Miss Lucretia\r\nPenniman.'\" (Loud and long-continued applause.)\r\n\r\nWell might Brampton be proud, too, of Gamaliel Ives, president of its\r\nliterary club, who could make such a speech as this on such short notice.\r\nIf the truth be told, the literary club had sent Miss Lucretia no less\r\nthan seven invitations, and this was the speech Mr. Ives had intended to\r\nmake on those seven occasions. It was unquestionably a neat speech, and\r\nJudge Graves or no other chairman should cheat him out of making it. Mr.\r\nIves, with a wave of his hand toward the celebrity, sat down by no means\r\ndissatisfied with himself. What did he care how the judge glared. He did\r\nnot see how stiffly Miss Lucretia sat in her chair. She could not take\r\nhim on her knee then, but she would have liked to.\r\n\r\nMiss Lucretia rose, and stood quite as stiffly as she had sat, and the\r\njudge rose, too. He was very angry, but this was not the time to get even\r\nwith Mr. Ives. As it turned out, he did not need to bother about getting\r\neven.\r\n\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" said he, \"in the absence of any other chairman I\r\ntake pleasure in introducing to you Miss Lucretia Penniman.\"\r\n\r\nMore applause was started, but Miss Lucretia put a stop to it by the\r\nlifting of a hand. Then there was a breathless silence. Then she cast her\r\neyes around the hall, as though daring any one to break that silence, and\r\nfinally they rested upon Mr. Ives.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Chairman,\" she said, with an inclination toward the judge, \"my\r\nfriends--for I hope you will be my friends when I have finished\" (Miss\r\nLucretia made it quite clear by her tone that it entirely depended upon\r\nthem whether they would be or not), \"I understood when I came here that\r\nthis was to be a mass meeting to protest against an injustice, and not a\r\nfeast of literature and oratory, as Gamaliel Ives seems to suppose.\"\r\n\r\nShe paused, and when the first shock of amazement was past an audible\r\ntitter ran through the audience, and Mr. Ives squirmed visibly.\r\n\r\n\"Am I right, Mr. Chairman?\" asked Miss Lucretia.\r\n\r\n\"You are unquestionably right, Miss Penniman,\" answered the chairman,\r\nrising, \"unquestionably.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I will proceed,\" said Miss Lucretia. \"I wrote the Hymn to Coniston'\r\nmany years ago, when I was younger, and yet it is true that I have always\r\nremembered Brampton with kindly feelings. The friends of our youth are\r\ndear to us. We look indulgently upon their failings, even as they do on\r\nours. I have scanned the faces here in the hall to-night, and there are\r\nsome that have not changed beyond recognition in thirty years. Ezra\r\nGraves I remember, and it is a pleasure to see him in that chair.\" (Mr.\r\nGraves inclined his head, reverently. None knew how the inner man\r\nexulted.) \"But there was one who was often in Brampton in those days,\"\r\nMiss Lucretia continued, \"whom we all loved and with whom we found no\r\nfault, and I confess that when I have thought of Brampton I have oftenest\r\nthought of her. Her name,\" said Miss Lucretia, her hand now in the\r\nreticule, \"her name was Cynthia Ware.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a decided stir among the audience, and many leaned forward to\r\ncatch every word.\r\n\r\n\"Even old people may have an ideal,\" said Miss Lucretia, \"and you will\r\nforgive me for speaking of mine. Where should I speak of it, if not in\r\nthis village, among those who knew her and among their children? Cynthia\r\nWare, although she was younger than I, has been my ideal, and is still.\r\nShe was the daughter of the Rev. Samuel Ware of Coniston, and a\r\ndescendant of Captain Timothy Prescott, whom General Stark called 'Honest\r\nTim.' She was, to me, all that a woman should be, in intellect, in her\r\nscorn of all that is ignoble and false, and in her loyalty to her\r\nfriends.\" Here the handkerchief came out of the reticule. \"She went to\r\nBoston to teach school, and some time afterward I was offered a position\r\nin New York, and I never saw her again. But she married in Boston a man\r\nof learning and literary attainments, though his health was feeble and he\r\nwas poor, William Wetherell.\" (Another stir.) \"Mr. Wetherell was a\r\ngentleman--Cynthia Ware could have married no other--and he came of good\r\nand honorable people in Portsmouth. Very recently I read a collection of\r\nletters which he wrote to the Newcastle Guardian, which some of you may\r\nknow. I did not trust my own judgment as to those letters, but I took\r\nthem to an author whose name is known wherever English is spoken, but\r\nwhich I will not mention. And the author expressed it as his opinion, in\r\nwriting to me, that William Wetherell was undoubtedly a genius of a high\r\norder, and that he would have been so recognized if life had given him a\r\nchance. Mr. Wetherell, after his wife died, was taken in a dying\r\ncondition to Coniston, where he was forced, in order to earn his living,\r\nto become the storekeeper there. But he took his books with him, and\r\nfound time to write the letters of which I have spoken, and to give his\r\ndaughter an early education such as few girls have.\r\n\r\n\"My friends, I am rejoiced to see that the spirit of justice and the\r\nsense of right are as strong in Brampton as they used to be--strong\r\nenough to fill this town hall to overflowing because a teacher has been\r\nwrongly--yes, and iniquitously--dismissed from the lower school.\" (Here\r\nthere was a considerable stir, and many wondered whether Miss Lucretia\r\nwas aware of the irony in her words.) \"I say wrongly and iniquitously,\r\nbecause I have had the opportunity in Boston this winter of learning to\r\nknow and love that teacher. I am not given to exaggeration, my friends,\r\nand when I tell you that I know her, that her character is as high and\r\npure as her mother's, I can say no more. I am here to tell you this\r\nto-night because I do not believe you know her as I do. During the\r\nseventy years I have lived I have grown to have but little faith in\r\noutward demonstration, to believe in deeds and attainments rather than\r\nexpressions. And as for her fitness to teach, I believe that even the\r\nprudential committee could find no fault with that.\" (I wonder whether\r\nMr. Dodd was in the back of the hall.) \"I can find no fault with it. I am\r\nconstantly called upon to recommend teachers, and I tell you I should\r\nhave no hesitation in sending Cynthia Wetherell to a high school, young\r\nas she is.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now, my friends, why was she dismissed? I have heard the facts,\r\nthough not from her. Cynthia Wetherell does not know that I have come to\r\nBrampton, unless somebody has told her, and did not know that I was\r\ncoming. I have heard the facts, and I find it difficult to believe that\r\nso great a wrong could be attempted against a woman, and if the name of\r\nCynthia Wetherell had meant no more to me than the letters in it I should\r\nhave travelled twice as far as Brampton, old as I am, to do my utmost to\r\nright that wrong. I give you my word of honor that I have never been so\r\nindignant in my life. I do not come here to stir up enmities among you,\r\nand I will mention no more names. I prefer to believe that the prudential\r\ncommittee of this district has made a mistake, the gravity of which they\r\nmust now realize, and that they will reinstate Cynthia Wetherell\r\nto-morrow. And if they should not of their own free will, I have only to\r\nlook around this meeting to be convinced that they will be compelled to.\r\nCompelled to, my friends, by the sense of justice and the righteous\r\nindignation of the citizens of Brampton.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Lucretia sat down, her strong face alight with the spirit that was\r\nin her. Not the least of the compelling forces in this world is righteous\r\nanger, and when it is exercised by a man or a woman whose life has been a\r\ncontinual warfare against the pests of wrong, it is well-nigh\r\nirresistible. While you could count five seconds the audience sat silent,\r\nand then began such tumult and applause as had never been seen in\r\nBrampton--all started, so it is said, by an old soldier in the front row\r\nwith his stick. Isaac D. Worthington, sitting alone in the library of his\r\nmansion, heard it, and had no need to send for Mr. Flint to ask what it\r\nwas, or who it was had fired the Third Estate. And Mr. Dodd heard it. He\r\nmay have been in the hall, but now he sat at home, seeing visions of the\r\nlantern, and he would have fled to the palace had he thought to get any\r\nsympathy from his sovereign. No, Mr. Dodd did not hold the Bastille or\r\neven fight for it. Another and a better man gave up the keys, for heroes\r\nare sometimes hidden away in meek and retiring people who wear spectacles\r\nand have a stoop to their shoulders. Long before the excitement died away\r\na dozen men were on their feet shouting at the chairman, and among them\r\nwas the tall, stooping man with spectacles. He did not shout, but Judge\r\nGraves saw him and made up his mind that this was the man to speak. The\r\nchairman raised his hand and rapped with his gavel, and at length he had\r\nobtained silence.\r\n\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he said, \"I am going to recognize Mr. Hill of the\r\nprudential committee, and ask him to step up on the platform.\"\r\n\r\nThere fell another silence, as absolute as the first, when Mr. Hill\r\nwalked down the aisle and climbed the steps. Indeed, people were\r\nstupefied, for the feed dealer was a man who had never opened his mouth\r\nin town-meeting; who had never taken an initiative of any kind; who had\r\nallowed other men to take advantage of him, and had never resented it.\r\nAnd now he was going to speak. Would he defend the prudential committee,\r\nor would he declare for the teacher? Either course, in Mr. Hill's case,\r\nrequired courage, and he had never been credited with any. If Mr. Hill\r\nwas going to speak at all, he was going to straddle.\r\n\r\nHe reached the platform, bowed irresolutely to the chairman, and then\r\nstood awkwardly with one knee bent, peering at his audience over his\r\nglasses. He began without any address whatever.\r\n\r\n\"I want to say,\" he began in a low voice, \"that I had no intention of\r\ncoming to this meeting. And I am going to confess--I am going to confess\r\nthat I was afraid to come.\" He raised his voice a little defiantly a the\r\nwords, and paused. One could almost hear the people breathing. \"I was\r\nafraid to come for fear that I should do the very thing I am going to do\r\nnow. And yet I was impelled to come. I want to say that my conscience has\r\nnot been clear since, as a member of the prudential committee, I gave my\r\nconsent to the dismissal of Miss Wetherell. I know that I was influenced\r\nby personal and selfish considerations which should have had no weight.\r\nAnd after listening to Miss Penniman I take this opportunity to declare,\r\nof my own free will, that I will add my vote to that of Judge Graves to\r\nreinstate Miss Wetherell.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hill bowed slightly, and was about to descend the steps when the\r\nchairman, throwing parliamentary dignity to the winds, arose and seized\r\nthe feed dealer's hand. And the people in the hall almost as one man\r\nsprang to their feet and cheered, and some--Ephraim Prescott among\r\nthese--even waved their hats and shouted Mr. Hill's name. A New England\r\naudience does not frequently forget itself, but there were few present\r\nwho did not understand the heroism of the man's confession, who were not\r\ncarried away by the simple and dramatic dignity of it. He had no need to\r\nmention Mr. Worthington's name, or specify the nature of his obligations\r\nto that gentleman. In that hour Jonathan Hill rose high in the respect of\r\nBrampton, and some pressed into the aisle to congratulate him on his way\r\nback to his seat. Not a few were grateful to him for another reason. He\r\nhad relieved the meeting of the necessity of taking any further action:\r\nof putting their names, for instance, in their enthusiasm to a paper\r\nwhich the first citizen might see.\r\n\r\nJudge Graves, whose sense of a climax was acute, rapped for order.\r\n\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he said, in a voice not wholly free from emotion,\r\n\"you will all wish to pay your respects to the famous lady, who is with\r\nus. I see that the Rev. Mr. Sweet is present, and I suggest that we\r\nadjourn, after he has favored us with a prayer.\"\r\n\r\nAs the minister came forward, Deacon Hartington dropped his head and\r\nbegan to flutter his eyelids. The Rev. Mr. Sweet prayed, and so was\r\nbrought to an end the most exciting meeting ever held in Brampton town\r\nhall.\r\n\r\nBut Miss Lucretia did not like being called \"a famous lady.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nWhile Miss Lucretia was standing, unwillingly enough, listening to the\r\nspeeches that were poured into her ear by various members of the\r\naudience, receiving the incense and myrrh to which so great a celebrity\r\nwas entitled, the old soldier hobbled away to his little house as fast as\r\nhis three legs would carry him. Only one event in his life had eclipsed\r\nthis in happiness--the interview in front of the White House. He rapped\r\non the window with his stick, thereby frightening Cynthia half out of her\r\nwits as she sat musing sorrowfully by the fire.\r\n\r\n\"Cousin Ephraim,\" she said, taking off his corded hat, \"what in the\r\nworld's the matter with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're a schoolmarm again, Cynthy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Lucretia Penniman done it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Lucretia Penniman!\" Cynthia began to think his rheumatism was\r\ndriving him out of his mind.\r\n\r\n\"You bet. 'Long toward the openin' of the engagement there wahn't\r\nscarcely anybody thar but me, and they was a-goin'. But they come fast\r\nenough when they l'arned she was in town, and she blew 'em up higher'n\r\nthe Petersburg crater. Great Tecumseh, there's a woman! Next to General\r\nGrant, I'd sooner shake her hand than anybody's livin'.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to say that Miss Lucretia is in Brampton and spoke at the\r\nmass meeting?\"\r\n\r\n\"Spoke!\" exclaimed Ephraim, \"callate she did--some. Tore 'em all up.\r\nThey'd a hung Isaac D. Worthington or Levi Dodd if they'd a had 'em\r\nthar.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia, striving to be calm herself, got him into a chair and took his\r\nstick and straightened out his leg, and then Ephraim told her the story,\r\nand it lost no dramatic effect in his telling. He would have talked all\r\nnight. But at length the sound of wheels was heard in the street, Cynthia\r\nflew to the door, and a familiar voice came out of the darkness.\r\n\r\n\"You need not wait, Gamaliel. No, thank you, I think I will stay at the\r\nhotel.\"\r\n\r\nGamaliel was still protesting when Miss Lucretia came in and seized\r\nCynthia in her arms, and the door was closed behind her.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Miss Lucretia, why did you come?\" said Cynthia, \"if I had known you\r\nwould do such a thing, I should never have written that letter. I have\r\nbeen sorry to-day that I did write it, and now I'm sorrier than ever.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aren't you glad to see me?\" demanded Miss Lucretia.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Lucretia!\"\r\n\r\n\"What are friends for?\" asked Miss Lucretia, patting her hand. \"If you\r\nhad known how I wished to see you, Cynthia, and I thought a little trip\r\nwould be good for such a provincial Bostonian as I am. Dear, dear, I\r\nremember this house. It used to belong to Gabriel Post in my time, and\r\nright across from it was the Social Library, where I have spent so many\r\npleasant hours with your mother. And this is Ephraim Prescott. I thought\r\nit was, when I saw him sitting in the front row, and I think he must have\r\nbeen very lonesome there at one time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" said Ephraim, giving her his gnarled fingers; \"I was just\r\nsayin' to Cynthy that I'd ruther shake your hand than anybody's livin'\r\nexceptin' General Grant.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I'd rather shake yours than the General's,\" said Miss Lucretia, for\r\nthe Woman's Hour had taken the opposition side in a certain recent public\r\nquestion concerning women.\r\n\r\n\"If you'd a fit with him, you wouldn't say that, Miss Lucrety.\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't a word to say against his fighting qualities,\" she replied.\r\n\r\n\"Guess the General might say the same of you,\" said Ephraim. \"If you'd a\r\nb'en a man, I callate you'd a come out of the war with two stars on your\r\nshoulder. Godfrey, Miss Lucrety, you'd ought to've b'en a man.\"\r\n\r\n\"A man!\" cried Miss Lucretia, \"and 'stars on my shoulder'! I think this\r\nkind of talk has gone far enough, Ephraim Prescott.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cousin Eph,\" said Cynthia, laughing, \"you're no match for Miss Lucretia,\r\nand it's long past your bedtime.\"\r\n\r\n\"A man!\" repeated Miss Lucretia, after he had retired, and after Cynthia\r\nhad tried to express her gratitude and had been silenced. They sat side\r\nby side in front of the chimney. \"I suppose he meant that as a\r\ncompliment. I never yet saw the man I couldn't back down, and I haven't\r\nany patience with a woman who gives in to them.\" Miss Lucretia poked\r\nvigorously a log which had fallen down, as though that were a man, too,\r\nand she was putting him back in his proper place.\r\n\r\nCynthia, strange to say, did not reply to this remark.\r\n\r\n\"Cynthia,\" said Miss Lucretia, abruptly, \"you don't mean to say that you\r\nare in love!\"\r\n\r\nCynthia drew a long breath, and grew as red as the embers.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Lucretia!\" she exclaimed, in astonishment and dismay.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" Miss Lucretia said, \"I should have thought you could have gotten\r\nalong, for a while at least, without anything of that kind. My dear,\" she\r\nsaid leaning toward Cynthia, \"who is he?\"\r\n\r\nCynthia turned away. She found it very hard to speak of her troubles,\r\neven to Miss Lucretia, and she would have kept this secret even from\r\nJethro, had it been possible.\r\n\r\n\"You must let him know his place,\" said Miss Lucretia, \"and I hope he is\r\nin some degree worthy of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not intend to marry him,\" said Cynthia, with head still turned\r\naway.\r\n\r\nIt was now Miss Lucretia who was silent.\r\n\r\n\"I came near getting married once,\" she said presently, with\r\ncharacteristic abruptness.\r\n\r\n\"You!\" cried Cynthia, looking around in amazement.\r\n\r\n\"You see, I am franker than you, my dear--though I never told any one\r\nelse. I believe you can keep a secret.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I can. Who--was it anyone in Brampton, Miss Lucretia?\" The\r\nquestion was out before Cynthia realized its import. She was turning the\r\ntables with a vengeance.\r\n\r\n\"It was Ezra Graves,\" said Miss Lucretia.\r\n\r\n\"Ezra Graves!\" And then Cynthia pressed Miss Lucretia's hand in silence,\r\nthinking how strange it was that both of them should have been her\r\nchampions that evening.\r\n\r\nMiss Lucretia poked the fire again.\r\n\r\n\"It was shortly after that, when I went to Boston, that I wrote the 'Hymn\r\nto Coniston.' I suppose we must all be fools once or twice, or we should\r\nnot be human.\"\r\n\r\n\"And--weren't you ever--sorry?\" asked Cynthia.\r\n\r\nAgain there was a silence.\r\n\r\n\"I could not have done the work I have had to do in the world if I had\r\nmarried. But I have often wondered whether that work was worth the while.\r\nSuch a feeling must come over all workers, occasionally. Yes,\" said Miss\r\nLucretia, \"there have been times when I have been sorry, my dear, though\r\nI have never confessed it to another soul. I am telling you this for your\r\nown good--not mine. If you have the love of a good man, Cynthia, be\r\ncareful what you do with it.\"\r\n\r\nThe tears had come into Cynthia's eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I should have told you, Miss Lucretia,\" she faltered. \"If I could have\r\nmarried him, it would have been easier.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why can't you marry him?\" demanded Miss Lucretia, sharply--to hide her\r\nown emotion.\r\n\r\n\"His name,\" said Cynthia, \"is Bob Worthington:\"\r\n\r\n\"Isaac Worthington's son?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nAnother silence, Miss Lucretia being utterly unable to say anything for a\r\nspace.\r\n\r\n\"Is he a good man?\"\r\n\r\nCynthia was on the point of indignant-protest, but she stopped herself in\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\"I will tell you what he has done,\" she answered, \"and then you shall\r\njudge for yourself.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she told Miss Lucretia, simply, all that Bob had done, and all that\r\nshe herself had done.\r\n\r\n\"He is like his mother, Sarah Hollingsworth; I knew her well,\" said Miss\r\nLucretia. \"If Isaac Worthington were a man, he would be down on his knees\r\nbegging you to marry his son. He tried hard enough to marry your own\r\nmother.\"\r\n\r\n\"My mother!\" exclaimed Cynthia, who had never believed that rumor.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Miss Lucretia, \"and you may thank your stars he didn't\r\nsucceed. I mistrusted him when he was a young man, and now I know that he\r\nhasn't changed. He is a coward and a hypocrite.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia could not deny this.\r\n\r\n\"And yet,\" she said, after a moment's silence, \"I am sure you will say\r\nthat I have been right. My own conscience tells me that it is wrong to\r\ndeprive Bob of his inheritance, and to separate him from his father,\r\nwhatever his father--may be.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall see what happens in five years,\" said Miss Lucretia.\r\n\r\n\"Five years!\" said Cynthia, in spite of herself.\r\n\r\n\"Jacob served seven for Rachel,\" answered Miss Lucretia; \"that period is\r\nscarcely too short to test a man, and you are both young.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Cynthia, \"I cannot marry him, Miss Lucretia. The world would\r\naccuse me of design, and I feel that I should not be happy. I am sure\r\nthat he would never reproach me, even if things went wrong, but--the day\r\nmight come when--when he would wish that it had been otherwise.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Lucretia kissed her.\r\n\r\n\"You are very young, my dear,\" she repeated, \"and none of us may say what\r\nchanges time may bring forth. And now I must go.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia insisted upon walking with her friend down the street to the\r\nhotel--an undertaking that was without danger in Brampton. And it was\r\nonly a step, after all. A late moon floated in the sky, throwing in\r\nrelief the shadow of the Worthington mansion against the white patches of\r\nsnow. A light was still burning in the library.\r\n\r\nThe next morning after breakfast Miss Lucretia appeared at the little\r\nhouse, and informed Cynthia that she would walk to school with her.\r\n\r\n\"But I have not yet been notified by the Committee,\" said Cynthia. There\r\nwas a knock at the door, and in walked Judge Ezra Graves. Miss Lucretia\r\nmay have blushed, but it is certain that Cynthia did. Never had she seen\r\nthe judge so spick and span, and he wore the broadcloth coat he usually\r\nreserved for Sundays. He paused at the threshold, with his hand on his\r\nAdam's apple.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, ladies,\" he said, and looked shyly at Miss Lucretia and\r\ncleared his throat, and spoke with the elaborate decorum he used on\r\noccasions, \"Miss Penniman, I wish to thank you again for your noble\r\naction of last evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't 'Miss Penniman' me, Ezra Graves,\" retorted Miss Lucretia; \"the\r\nonly noble action I know of was poor Jonathan Hill's--unless it was\r\npaying for the gas.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the way in which Miss Lucretia treated her lover after thirty\r\nyears! Cynthia thought of what the lady had said to her a few hours\r\nsince, by this very fire, and began to believe she must have dreamed it.\r\nFires look very differently at night--and sometimes burn brighter then.\r\nThe judge parted his coat tails, and seated himself on the wooden edge of\r\na cane-bottomed chair.\r\n\r\n\"Lucretia,\" he said, \"you haven't changed.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have, Ezra,\" she replied, looking at the Adam's apple.\r\n\r\n\"I'm an old man,\" said Ezra Graves.\r\n\r\nCynthia could not help thinking that he was a very different man, in Miss\r\nLucretia's presence, than when at the head of the prudential committee.\r\n\r\n\"Ezra,\" said Miss Lucretia, \"for a man you do very well.\"\r\n\r\nThe judge smiled.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Lucretia,\" said he. He seemed to appreciate the full extent\r\nof the compliment.\r\n\r\n\"Judge Graves,\" said Cynthia, \"I can tell you how good you are, at least,\r\nand thank you for your great kindness to me, which I shall never forget.\"\r\n\r\nShe took his withered hands from his knees and pressed them. He returned\r\nthe pressure, and then searched his coat tails, found a handkerchief, and\r\nblew his nose violently.\r\n\r\n\"I merely did my duty, Miss Wetherell,\" he said. \"I would not wilfully\r\nsubmit to a wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"You called me Cynthia yesterday.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I did,\" he answered, \"so I did.\" Then he looked at Miss Lucretia.\r\n\r\n\"Ezra,\" said that lady, smiling a little, \"I don't believe you have\r\nchanged, after all.\"\r\n\r\nWhat she meant by that nobody knows.\r\n\r\n\"I had thought, Cynthia,\" said the judge, \"that it might be more\r\ncomfortable for you to have me go to the school with you. That is the\r\nreason for my early call.\"\r\n\r\n\"Judge Graves, I do appreciate your kindness,\" said Cynthia; \"I hope you\r\nwon't think I'm rude if I say I'd rather go alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary, my dear,\" replied the judge, \"I think I can understand\r\nand esteem your feeling in the matter, and it shall be as you wish.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I think I had better be going,\" said Cynthia. The judge rose in\r\nalarm at the words, but she put her hand on his shoulder. \"Won't you sit\r\ndown and stay,\" she begged, \"you haven't seen Miss Lucretia for how many\r\nyears,--thirty, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\nAgain he glanced at Miss Lucretia, uncertainly. \"Sit down, Ezra,\" she\r\ncommanded, \"and for goodness' sake don't be afraid of the cane bottom.\r\nYou won't go through it. I should like to talk to you, and most of the\r\ngossips of our day are dead. I shall stay in Brampton to-day, Cynthia,\r\nand eat supper with you here this evening.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia, as she went out of the door, wondered what they would talk\r\nabout. Then she turned toward the school. It was not the March wind that\r\nburned her cheeks; as she thought of the mass meeting the night before,\r\nwhich was all about her, she wished she might go to school that morning\r\nthrough the woods and pasture lots rather than down Brampton Street.\r\nWhat--what would Bob say when he heard of the meeting? Would he come\r\nagain to Brampton? If he did, she would run away to Boston with Miss\r\nLucretia. Every day it had been a trial to pass the Worthington house,\r\nbut she could not cross the wide street to avoid it. She hurried a\r\nlittle, unconsciously, when she came to it, for there was Mr. Worthington\r\non the steps talking to Mr. Flint. How he must hate her now, Cynthia\r\nreflected! He did not so much as look up when she passed.\r\n\r\nThe other citizens whom she met made up for Mr. Worthington's coldness,\r\nand gave her a hearty greeting, and some stopped to offer their\r\ncongratulations. Cynthia did not pause to philosophize: she was learning\r\nto accept the world as it was, and hurried swiftly on to the little\r\nschoolhouse. The children saw her coming, and ran to meet her and\r\nescorted her triumphantly in at the door. Of their welcome she could be\r\nsure. Thus she became again teacher of the lower school.\r\n\r\nHow the judge and Miss Lucretia got along that morning, Cynthia never\r\nknew. Miss Lucretia spent the day in her old home, submitting to\r\nhero-worship, and attended an evening party in her honor at Mr. Gamaliel\r\nIves's house--a mansion not so large as the first citizen's, though it\r\nhad two bay-windows and was not altogether unimposing. The first citizen,\r\nneedless to say, was not there, but the rest of the elite attended. Mr.\r\nIves will tell you all about the entertainment if you go to Brampton, but\r\nthe real reason Miss Lucretia consented to go was to please Lucy Baird,\r\nwho was Gamaliel's wife, and to chat with certain old friends whom she\r\nhad not seen. The next morning she called at the school to bid Cynthia\r\ngood-by, and to whisper something in her ear which made her very red\r\nbefore all the scholars. She shook her head when Miss Lucretia said it,\r\nfor it had to do with an incident in the 29th chapter of Genesis.\r\n\r\nWhile Jonathan Hill was being made a hero of in the little two-by-four\r\noffice of the feed store the morning after the mass meeting (though\r\nnobody offered to take over his mortgage), Mr. Dodd was complaining to\r\nhis wife of shooting pains, and \"callated\" he would stay at home that\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\"Shootin' fiddlesticks!\" said Mrs. Dodd. \"Get along down to the store and\r\nface the music, Levi Dodd. You'd have had shootin' pains if you'd a went\r\nto the meetin'.\"\r\n\r\n\"I might stop by at Mr. Worthington's house and explain how powerless I\r\nwas--\"\r\n\r\n\"For goodness' sake git out, Levi. I guess he knows how powerless you are\r\nwith your shootin' pains. If you only could forget Isaac D. Worthington\r\nfor three minutes, you wouldn't have 'em.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Dodd's two clerks saw him enter the store by the back door and he was\r\nvery much interested in the new ploughs which were piled up in crates\r\noutside of it. Then he disappeared into his office and shut the door, and\r\nsupposedly became very much absorbed in book-keeping. If any one called,\r\nhe was out--any one. Plenty of people did call, but he was not\r\ndisturbed--until ten o'clock. Mr. Dodd had a very sensitive ear, and he\r\ncould often recognize a man by his step, and this man he recognized.\r\n\r\n\"Where's Mr. Dodd?\" demanded the owner of the step, indignantly.\r\n\r\n\"He's out, Mr. Worthington. Anything I can do for you, Mr. Worthington?\"\r\n\r\n\"You can tell him to come up to my house the moment he comes in.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately Mr. Dodd in the office had got into a strained position. He\r\nfound it necessary to move a little; the day-book fell heavily to the\r\nfloor, and the perspiration popped out all over his forehead. Come out,\r\nLevi Dodd. The Bastille is taken, but there are other fortresses still in\r\nthe royal hands where you may be confined.\r\n\r\n\"Who's in the office?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, sir,\" answered the clerk, winking at his companion, who\r\nwas sorting nails.\r\n\r\nIn three strides the great man had his hand on the office door and had\r\nflung it open, disclosing the culprit cowering over the day-book on the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Dodd,\" cried the first citizen, \"what do you mean by--?\"\r\n\r\nSome natures, when terrified, are struck dumb. Mr. Dodd's was the kind\r\nwhich bursts into speech.\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't help it, Mr. Worthington,\" he cried, \"they would have it. I\r\ndon't know what got into 'em. They lost their senses, Mr. Worthington,\r\nplumb lost their senses. If you'd a b'en there, you might have brought\r\n'em to. I tried to git the floor, but Ezry Graves--\"\r\n\r\n\"Confound Ezra Graves, and wait till I have done, can't you,\" interrupted\r\nthe first citizen, angrily. \"What do you mean by putting a bath-tub into\r\nmy house with the tin loose, so that I cut my leg on it?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Dodd nearly fainted from sheer relief.\r\n\r\n\"I'll put a new one in to-day, right now,\" he gasped.\r\n\r\n\"See that you do,\" said the first citizen, \"and if I lose my leg, I'll\r\nsue you for a hundred thousand dollars.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was a-goin' to explain about them losin' their heads at the mass\r\nmeetin'--\"\r\n\r\n\"Damn their heads!\" said the first citizen. \"And yours, too,\" he may have\r\nadded under his breath as he stalked out. It was not worth a swing of the\r\nexecutioner's axe in these times of war. News had arrived from the state\r\ncapital that morning of which Mr. Dodd knew nothing. Certain feudal\r\nchiefs from the North Country, of whose allegiance Mr. Worthington had\r\nfelt sure, had obeyed the summons of their old sovereign, Jethro Bass,\r\nand had come South to hold a conclave under him at the Pelican. Those\r\nchiefs of the North Country, with their clans behind them as one man,\r\nwhat a power they were in the state! What magnificent qualities they had,\r\nin battle or strategy, and how cunning and shrewd was their generalship!\r\nYear after year they came down from their mountains and fought shoulder\r\nto shoulder, and year after year they carried back the lion's share of\r\nthe spoils between them. The great South, as a whole, was powerless to\r\nresist them, for there could be no lasting alliance between Harwich and\r\nBrampton and Newcastle and Gosport. Now their king had come back, and the\r\nNorth Country men were rallying again to his standard. No wonder that\r\nLevi Dodd's head, poor thing that it was, was safe for a while.\r\n\r\n\"Organize what you have left, and be quick about it,\" said Mr. Flint,\r\nwhen the news had come, and they sat in the library planning a new\r\ncampaign in the face of this evident defection. There was no time to cry\r\nover spilt milk or reinstated school-teachers. The messages flew far and\r\nwide to the manufacturing towns to range their guilds into line for the\r\nrailroads. The seneschal wrote the messages, and sent the summons to the\r\nsleek men of the cities, and let it be known that the coffers were full\r\nand not too tightly sealed, that the faithful should not lack for the\r\nsinews of war. Mr. Flint found time, too, to write some carefully worded\r\nbut nevertheless convincing articles for the Newcastle Guardian, very\r\ndamaging to certain commanders who had proved unfaithful.\r\n\r\n\"Flint,\" said Mr. Worthington, when they had worked far into the night,\r\n\"if Bass beats us, I'm a crippled man.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if you postpone the fight now that you have begun it? What then?\"\r\n\r\nThe answer, Mr. Worthington knew, was the same either way. He did not\r\nrepeat it. He went to his bed, but not to sleep for many hours, and when\r\nhe came down to his breakfast in the morning, he was in no mood to read\r\nthe letter from Cambridge which Mrs. Holden had put on his plate. But he\r\ndid read it, with what anger and bitterness may be imagined. There was\r\nthe ultimatum,--respectful, even affectionate, but firm. \"I know that you\r\nwill, in all probability, disinherit me as you say, and I tell you\r\nhonestly that I regret the necessity of quarrelling with you more than I\r\ndo the money. I do not pretend to say that I despise money, and I like\r\nthe things that it buys, but the woman I love is more to me than all that\r\nyou have.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington laid the letter down, and there came irresistibly to his\r\nmind something that his wife had said to him before she died, shortly\r\nafter they had moved into the mansion. \"Dudley, how happy we used to be\r\ntogether before we were rich!\" Money had not been everything to Sarah\r\nWorthington, either. But now no tender wave of feeling swept over him as\r\nhe recalled those words. He was thinking of what weapon he had to prevent\r\nthe marriage beyond that which was now useless--disinheritance. He would\r\ndisinherit Bob, and that very day. He would punish his son to the utmost\r\nof his power for marrying the ward of Jethro Bass. He wondered bitterly,\r\nin case a certain event occurred, whether he would have much to alienate.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Flint arrived, fresh as usual in spite of the work he had\r\naccomplished and the cigars he had smoked the night before, Mr.\r\nWorthington still had the letter in his hand, and was pacing his library\r\nfloor, and broke into a tirade against his son.\r\n\r\n\"After all I have done for him, building up for him a position and a\r\nfortune that is only surpassed by young Duncan's, to treat me in this\r\nway, to drag down the name of Worthington in the mire. I'll never forgive\r\nhim. I'll send for Dixon and leave the money for a hospital in Brampton.\r\nCan't you suggest any way out of this, Flint?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Flint, \"not now. The only chance you have is to ignore the\r\nthing from now on. He may get tired of her--I've known such things to\r\nhappen.\"\r\n\r\n\"When she hears that I've disinherited him, she will get tired of him,\"\r\ndeclared Mr. Worthington.\r\n\r\n\"Try it and see, if you like,\" said Flint.\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Flint, if the woman has a spark of decent feeling, as you\r\nseem to think, I'll send for her and tell her that she will ruin Robert\r\nif she marries him.\" Mr. Worthington always spoke of his son as \"Robert.\"\r\n\r\n\"You ought to have thought of that before the mass meeting. Perhaps it\r\nwould have done some good then.\"\r\n\r\n\"Because this Penniman woman has stirred people up--is that what you\r\nmean? I don't care anything about that. Money counts in the long run.\"\r\n\r\n\"If money counted with this school-teacher, it would be a simple matter.\r\nI think you'll find it doesn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've known you to make some serious mistakes,\" snapped Mr. Worthington.\r\n\r\n\"Then why do you ask for my advice?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll send for her, and appeal to her better nature,\" said Mr.\r\nWorthington, with an unconscious and sublime irony.\r\n\r\nFlint gave no sign that he heard. Mr. Worthington seated himself at his\r\ndesk, and after some thought wrote on a piece of note-paper the following\r\nlines: \"My dear Miss Wetherell, I should be greatly obliged if you would\r\nfind it convenient to call at my house at eight o'clock this evening,\"\r\nand signed them, \"Sincerely Yours.\" He sealed them up in an envelope and\r\naddressed it to Miss Wetherell, at the schoolhouse; and handed it to Mr.\r\nFlint. That gentleman got as far as the door, and then he hesitated and\r\nturned.\r\n\r\n\"There is just one way out of this for you, that I can see, Mr.\r\nWorthington,\" he said. \"It's a desperate measure, but it's worth thinking\r\nabout.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\"\r\n\r\nIt took some courage for Mr. Flint, to make the suggestion. \"The girl's a\r\ngood girl, well educated, and by no means bad looking. Bob might do a\r\nthousand times worse. Give your consent to the marriage, and Jethro Bass\r\nwill go back to Coniston.\"\r\n\r\nIt was wisdom such as few lords get from their seneschals, but Isaac D.\r\nWorthington did not so recognize it. His anger rose and took away his\r\nbreath as he listened to it.\r\n\r\n\"I will never give my consent to it, never--do you hear?--never. Send\r\nthat note!\" he cried.\r\n\r\nMr. Flint walked out, sent the note, and returned and took his place\r\nsilently at his own table. He was a man of concentration, and he put his\r\nmind on the arguments he was composing to certain political leaders. Mr.\r\nWorthington merely pretended to work as he waited for the answer to come\r\nback. And presently, when it did come back, he tore it open and read it\r\nwith an expression not often on his lips. He flung the paper at Mr.\r\nFlint.\r\n\r\n\"Read that,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThis is what Mr. Flint read: \"Miss Wetherell begs to inform Mr. Isaac D.\r\nWorthington that she can have no communication or intercourse with him\r\nwhatsoever.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Flint handed it back without a word. His opinion of the\r\nschool-teacher had risen mightily, but he did not say so. Mr. Worthington\r\ntook the note, too, without a word. Speech was beyond him, and he crushed\r\nthe paper as fiercely as he would have liked to have crushed Cynthia, had\r\nshe been in his hands.\r\n\r\nOne accomplishment which Cynthia had learned at Miss Sadler's school was\r\nto write a letter in the third person, Miss Sadler holding that there\r\nwere occasions when it was beneath a lady's dignity to write a direct\r\nnote. And Cynthia, sitting at her little desk in the schoolhouse during\r\nher recess, had deemed this one of the occasions. She could not bring\r\nherself to write, \"My dear Mr. Worthington.\" Her anger, when the note had\r\nbeen handed to her, was for the moment so great that she could not go on\r\nwith her classes; but she had controlled it, and compelled Silas to stand\r\nin the entry until recess, when she sat with her pen in her hand until\r\nthat happy notion of the third person occurred to her. And after Silas\r\nhad gone she sat still; though trembling a little at intervals, picturing\r\nwith some satisfaction Mr. Worthington's appearance when he received her\r\nanswer. Her instinct told her that he had received his son's letter, and\r\nthat he had sent for her to insult her. By sending for her, indeed, he\r\nhad insulted her irrevocably, and that is why she trembled.\r\n\r\nPoor Cynthia! her troubles came thick and fast upon her in those days.\r\nWhen she reached home, there was the letter which Ephraim had left on the\r\ntable addressed in the familiar, upright handwriting, and when Cynthia\r\nsaw it, she caught her hand sharply at her breast, as if the pain there\r\nhad stopped the beating of her heart. Well it was for Bob's peace of mind\r\nthat he could not see her as she read it, and before she had come to the\r\nend there were drops on the sheets where the purple ink had run. How\r\nprecious would have been those drops to him! He would never give her up.\r\nNo mandate or decree could separate them--nothing but death. And he was\r\nhappier now so he told her--than he had been for months: happy in the\r\nthought that he was going out into the world to win bread for her, as\r\nbecame a man. Even if he had not her to strive for, he saw now that such\r\nwas the only course for him. He could not conform.\r\n\r\nIt was a manly letter,--how manly Bob himself never knew. But Cynthia\r\nknew, and she wept over it and even pressed it to her lips--for there\r\nwas no one to see. Yes, she loved him as she would not have believed it\r\npossible to love, and she sat through the afternoon reading his words and\r\nrepeating them until it seemed that he were there by her side, speaking\r\nthem. They came, untrammelled and undefiled, from his heart into hers.\r\n\r\nAnd now that he had quarrelled with his father for her sake, and was bent\r\nwith all the determination of his character upon making his own way in\r\nthe world, what was she to do? What was her duty? Not one letter of the\r\ntwoscore she had received (so she kept their count from day to day)--not\r\none had she answered. His faith had indeed been great. But she must\r\nanswer this: must write, too, on that subject of her dismissal, lest it\r\nshould be wrongly told him. He was rash in his anger, and fearless; this\r\nshe knew, and loved him for such qualities as he had.\r\n\r\nShe must stay in Brampton and do her work,--so much was clearly her duty,\r\nalthough she longed to flee from it. And at last she sat down and wrote\r\nto him. Some things are too sacred to be set forth on a printed page, and\r\nthis letter is one of those things. Try as she would, she could not find\r\nit in her heart at such a time to destroy his hope,--or her own. The hope\r\nwhich she would not acknowledge, and the love which she strove to conceal\r\nfrom him seeped up between the words of her letter like water through\r\ngrains of sand. Words, indeed, are but as grains of sand to conceal\r\nstrong feelings, and as Cynthia read the letter over she felt that every\r\nline betrayed her, and knew that she could compose no lines which would\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nShe said nothing of the summons which she had received that morning, or\r\nof her answer; and her account of the matter of the dismissal and\r\nreinstatement was brief and dignified, and contained no mention of Mr.\r\nWorthington's name or agency. It was her duty, too, to rebuke Bob for the\r\nquarrel with his father, to point out the folly of it, and the wrong, and\r\nto urge him as strongly as she could to retract, though she felt that all\r\nthis was useless. And then--then came the betrayal of hope. She could not\r\nask him never to see her again, but she did beseech him for her sake, and\r\nfor the sake of that love which he had declared, not to attempt to see\r\nher: not for a year, she wrote, though the word looked to her like\r\neternity. Her reasons, aside from her own scruples, were so obvious,\r\nwhile she taught in Brampton, that she felt that he would consent to\r\nbanishment--until the summer holidays in July, at least: and then she\r\nwould be in Coniston,--and would have had time to decide upon future\r\nsteps. A reprieve was all she craved,--a reprieve in which to reflect,\r\nfor she was in no condition to reflect now. Of one thing she was sure,\r\nthat it would not be right at this time to encourage him although she had\r\na guilty feeling that the letter had given him encouragement in spite of\r\nall the prohibitions it contained. \"If, in the future years,\" thought\r\nCynthia, as she sealed the envelope, \"he persists in his determination,\r\nwhat then?\" You, Miss Lucretia, of all people in the world, have planted\r\nthe seeds with your talk about Genesis!\r\n\r\nThe letter was signed \"One who will always remain your friend, Cynthia\r\nWetherell.\" And she posted it herself.\r\n\r\nWhen Ephraim came home to supper that evening, he brought the Brampton\r\nClarion, just out, and in it was an account of Miss Lucretia Penniman's\r\nspeech at the mass meeting, and of her visit, and of her career. It was\r\nwritten in Mr. Page's best vein, and so laudatory was it that we shall\r\nhave to spare Miss Lucretia in not repeating it here: yes, and omit the\r\nencomiums, too, on the teacher of the Brampton lower school. Mr.\r\nWorthington was not mentioned, and for this, at least, Cynthia drew along\r\nbreath of relief, though Ephraim was of the opinion that the first\r\ncitizen should have been scored as he deserved, and held up to the\r\ncontempt of his fellow-townsmen. The dismissal of the teacher, indeed,\r\nwas put down to a regrettable misconception on the part of \"one of the\r\nprudential committee,\" who had confessed his mistake in \"a manly and\r\naltogether praiseworthy speech.\" The article was as near the truth,\r\nperhaps, as the Clarions may come on such matters--which is not very\r\nnear. Cynthia would have been better pleased if Mr. Page had spared his\r\nreaders the recital of her qualities, and she did not in the least\r\nrecognize the paragon whom Miss Lucretia had befriended and defended. She\r\nwas thankful that Mr. Page did pot state that the celebrity had come up\r\nfrom Boston on her account. Miss Penniman had been \"actuated by a sudden\r\ndesire to see once more the beauties of her old home, to look into the\r\nfaces of the old friends who had followed her career with such pardonable\r\npride.\" The speech of the president of the literary club, you may be\r\nsure, was printed in full, for Mr. Ives himself had taken the trouble to\r\nwrite it out for the editor--by request, of course.\r\n\r\nCynthia turned over the sheet, and read many interesting items: one\r\nconcerning the beauty and fashion and intellect which attended the party\r\nat Mr. Gamaliel Ives's; in the Clovelly notes she saw that Miss Judy\r\nHatch, of Coniston, was visiting relatives there; she learned the output\r\nof the Worthington Mills for the past week. Cynthia was about to fold up\r\nthe paper and send it to Miss Lucretia, whom she thought it would amuse,\r\nwhen her eyes were arrested by the sight of a familiar name.\r\n\r\n        \"Jethro Bass come to life again.\r\n          From the State Tribune.\"\r\n\r\nThat was the heading. \"One of the greatest political surprises in many\r\nyears was the arrival in the capital on Wednesday of Judge Bass, whom it\r\nwas thought, had permanently retired from politics. This, at least, seems\r\nto have been the confident belief of a faction in the state who have at\r\nheart the consolidation of certain lines of railroads. Judge Bass was\r\nfound by a Tribune reporter in the familiar Throne Room at the Pelican,\r\nbut, as usual, he could not be induced to talk for publication. He was in\r\nconference throughout the afternoon with several well-known leaders from\r\nthe North Country. The return of Jethro Bass to activity seriously\r\ncomplicates the railroad situation, and many prominent politicians are\r\nfreely predicting to-night that, in spite of the town-meeting returns,\r\nthe proposed bill for consolidation will not go through. Judge Bass is a\r\nman of such remarkable personality that he has regained at a stroke much\r\nof the influence that he lost by the sudden and unaccountable retirement\r\nwhich electrified the state some months since. His reappearance, the news\r\nof which was the one topic in all political centres yesterday, is equally\r\nunaccountable. It is hinted that some action on the part of Isaac D.\r\nWorthington has brought Jethro Bass to life. They are known to be bitter\r\nenemies, and it is said that Jethro Bass has but one object in returning\r\nto the field--to crush the president of the Truro Railroad. Another\r\ntheory is that the railroads and interests opposed to the consolidation\r\nhave induced Judge Bass to take charge of their fight for them. All\r\nindications point to the fiercest struggle the state has ever seen in\r\nJune, when the Legislature meets. The Tribune, whose sentiments are well\r\nknown to be opposed to the iniquity of consolidation, extends a hearty\r\nwelcome to the judge. No state, we believe, can claim a party leader of a\r\nhigher order of ability than Jethro Bass.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia dropped the paper in her lap, and sat very still. This, then, was\r\nwhat happened when Jethro had heard of her dismissal--he had left\r\nConiston without writing her a word and passed through Brampton without\r\nseeing her. He had gone back to that life which he had abandoned for her\r\nsake; the temptation had been too strong, the desire for vengeance too\r\ngreat. He had not dared to see her. And yet the love for her which had\r\nbeen strong enough to make him renounce the homage of men, and even incur\r\ntheir ridicule, had incited him to this very act of vengeance.\r\n\r\nWhat should she do now, indeed? Had those peaceful and happy Saturdays\r\nand Sundays in Coniston passed away forever? Should she follow him to the\r\ncapital and appeal to him? Ah no, she felt that were a useless pain to\r\nthem both. She believed, now, that he had gone away from her for all\r\ntime, that the veil of limitless space was set between, them. Silently\r\nshe arose,--so silently that Ephraim, dozing by the fire, did not awake.\r\nShe went into her own room and wept, and after many hours fell into a\r\ndreamless sleep of sheer exhaustion.\r\n\r\nThe days passed, and the weeks; the snow ran from the brown fields, and\r\nmelted at length even in the moist crotches under the hemlocks of the\r\nnorthern slopes; the robin and bluebird came, the hillsides were mottled\r\nwith exquisite shades of green, and the scent of fruit blossom and balm\r\nof Gilead was in the air. June came as a maiden and grew into womanhood.\r\nBut Jethro Bass did not return to Coniston.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nThe legends which surround the famous war which we are about to touch\r\nupon are as dim as those of Troy or Tuscany. Decorous chronicles and\r\nbiographies and monographs and eulogies exist, bound in leather and\r\nstamped in gold, each lauding its own hero: chronicles written in really\r\nbeautiful language, and high-minded and noble, out of which the heroes\r\ncome unstained. Horatius holds the bridge, and not a dent in his armor;\r\nand swims the Tiber without getting wet or muddy. Castor and Pollux fight\r\nin the front rank at Lake Regillus, in the midst of all that gore and\r\nslaughter, and emerge all white and pure at the end of the day--but they\r\nare gods.\r\n\r\nOut of the classic wars to which we have referred sprang the great Roman\r\nRepublic and Empire, and legend runs into authentic and written history.\r\nJust so, parva componere magnis, out of the cloud-wrapped conflicts of\r\nthe five railroads of which our own Gaul is composed, emerged one\r\nimperial railroad, authentically and legally written down on the statute\r\nbooks, for all men to see. We cannot go behind that statute except to\r\ncollect the legends and write homilies about the heroes who held the\r\nbridges.\r\n\r\nIf we were not in mortal terror of the imperial power, and a little\r\nfearful, too, of tiring our readers, we would write out all the legends\r\nwe have collected of this first fight for consolidation, and show the\r\nblood, too.\r\n\r\nIn the statute books of a certain state may be found a number of laws\r\nsetting forth the various things that a railroad or railroads may do, and\r\non the margin of these pages is invariably printed a date, that being the\r\nparticular year in which these laws were passed. By a singular\r\ncoincidence it is the very year at which we have now arrived in our\r\nstory. We do not intend to give a map of the state, or discuss the merits\r\nor demerits of the consolidation of the Central and the Northwestern and\r\nthe Truro railroads. Such discussions are not the province of a novelist,\r\nand may all be found in the files of the Tribune at the State Library.\r\nThere were, likewise, decisions without number handed down by the various\r\ncourts before and after that celebrated session,--opinions on the\r\nvalidity of leases, on the extension of railroads, on the rights of\r\nindividual stockholders--all dry reading enough.\r\n\r\nAt the risk of being picked to pieces by the corporation lawyers who may\r\nread these pages, we shall attempt to state the situation and with all\r\nmodesty and impartiality--for we, at least, hold no brief. When Mr. Isaac\r\nD. Worthington obtained that extension of the Truro Railroad (which we\r\nhave read about from the somewhat verdant point of view of William\r\nWetherell), that railroad then formed a connection with another road\r\nwhich ran northward from Harwich through another state, and with which we\r\nhave nothing to do. Having previously purchased a line to the southward\r\nfrom the capital, Mr. Worthington's railroad was in a position to compete\r\nwith Mr. Duncan's (the \"Central\") for Canadian traffic, and also to cut\r\ninto the profits of the \"Northwestern,\" Mr. Lovejoy's road. In brief, the\r\nTruro Railroad found itself very advantageously placed, as Mr.\r\nWorthington and Mr. Flint had foreseen. There followed a period of\r\nbickering and recrimination, of attempts of the other two railroads to\r\nsecure representation in the Truro directorate, of suits and injunctions\r\nand appeals to the Legislature and I know not what else--in all of which\r\naffairs Mr. Bijah Bixby and other gentlemen we could name found both\r\npleasure and remuneration.\r\n\r\nOh, that those halcyon days of the little wars would come again, when a\r\ncaptain could ride out almost any time at the held of his band of\r\nmercenaries and see honest fighting and divide honest spoils! There was\r\nmuch knocking about of men and horses, but very little bloodshed, so we\r\nare told. Mr. Bixby will sit on the sunny side of his barns in Clovelly\r\nand tell you stories of that golden period with tears in his eyes, when\r\nhe went to conventions with a pocketful of proxies from the river towns,\r\nand controlled in the greatest legislative year of all a \"block\" which\r\nincluded the President of the Senate, for which he got the fabulous sum\r\nof----. He will tell you, but I won't. Mr. Bixby's occupation is gone\r\nnow. We have changed all that, and we are ruled from imperial Rome. If\r\nyou don't do right, they cut off your (political) head, and it is of no\r\nuse to run away, because there is no one to run to.\r\n\r\nIt was Isaac D. Worthington--or shall we say Mr. Flint?--who was\r\nresponsible for this pernicious change for the worse, who conceived the\r\nnotion of leasing for the Truro the Central and the Northwestern,--thus\r\nmaking one railroad out of the three. If such a gigantic undertaking\r\ncould be got through, Mr. Worthington very rightly deemed that the other\r\nrailroads of the state would eventually fall like ripe fruit into their\r\ncaps--owning the ground under the tree, as they would. A movement, which\r\nwe need not go unto, was first made upon the courts, and for a while\r\nadverse decisions came down like summer rain. A genius by the name of\r\nJethro Bass had for many years presided (in the room of the governor and\r\ncouncil at the State House) at the political birth of justices of the\r\nSupreme Court. None of them actually wore livery, but we have seen one of\r\nthem--along time ago--in a horse blanket. None of them were favorable to\r\nthe plans of Mr. Worthington and Mr. Duncan.\r\n\r\nWe have listened to the firing on the skirmish lines for a long time, and\r\nnow the real battle is at hand. It is June, and the Legislature is\r\nmeeting, and Bijah Bixby has come down to the capital at the head of his\r\nregiment of mercenaries, of which Mr. Sutton is the honorary colonel; the\r\nclans are here from the north, well quartered and well fed; the Throne\r\nRoom, within the sacred precincts of which we have been before, is\r\noccupied. But there is another headquarters now, too, in the Pelican\r\nHouse--a Railroad Room; larger than the Throne Room, with a bath-room\r\nleading out of it. Another old friend of ours, Judge Abner Parkinson of\r\nHarwich, he who gave the sardonic laugh when Sam Price applied for the\r\npost of road agent, may often be seen in that Railroad Room from now on.\r\nThe fact is that the judge is about to become famous far beyond the\r\nconfines of Harwich; for he, and none other, is the author of the\r\nConsolidation Bill itself.\r\n\r\nMr. Flint is the generalissimo of the allied railroads, and sits in his\r\nheadquarters early and late, going over the details of the campaign with\r\nhis lieutenants; scanning the clauses of the bill with Judge Parkinson\r\nfor the last time, and giving orders to the captains of mercenaries as to\r\nthe disposition of their forces; writing out passes for the deserving and\r\nthe true. For these latter, also, and for the wavering there is a\r\nclaw-hammer on the marble-topped mantel wielded by Mr. Bijah Bixby, pro\r\ntem chief of staff--or of the hammer, for he is self-appointed and very\r\nuseful. He opens the mysterious packing cases which come up to the\r\nRailroad Room thrice a week, and there is water to be had in the\r\nbath-room--and glasses. Mr. Bixby also finds time to do some of the\r\nscouting about the rotunda and lobbies, for which he is justly\r\ncelebrated, and to drill his regiment every day. The Honorable Heth\r\nSutton, M.C.,--who held the bridge in the Woodchuck Session,--is there\r\nalso, sitting in a corner, swelled with importance, smoking big Florizel\r\ncigars which come from--somewhere. There are, indeed, many great and\r\nbattle-scarred veterans who congregate in that room--too numerous and\r\ngreat to mention; and saunterers in the Capitol Park opposite know when a\r\ncouncil of war is being held by the volumes of smoke which pour out of\r\nthe window, just as the Romans are made cognizant by the smoking of a\r\nchimney of when another notable event takes place.\r\n\r\nWho, then, are left to frequent the Throne Room? Is that ancient seat of\r\npower deserted, and does Jethro Bass sit there alone behind the curtains,\r\nin his bitterness, thinking of other bright June days that are gone?\r\n\r\nOf all those who had been amazed when Jethro Bass suddenly emerged from\r\nhis retirement and appeared in the capital some months before, none were\r\nmore thunderstruck than certain gentlemen who had been to Coniston\r\nrepeatedly, but in vain, to urge him to make this very fight. The most\r\nimportant of these had been Mr. Balch, president of the \"Down East\" Road,\r\nand the representatives of two railroads of another state. They had at\r\nlast offered Jethro fabulous sums to take charge of their armies in the\r\nfield--sums, at least, that would seem fabulous to many people, and had\r\nseemed so to them. When they heard that the lion had roused and shaken\r\nhimself and had unaccountably come forth of his own accord, they hastened\r\nto the state capital to renew their offers. Another shock, but of a\r\ndifferent kind, was in store for them. Mr. Balch had not actually driven\r\nthe pack-mules, laden with treasure, to the door of the Pelican House,\r\nwhere Jethro might see them from his window; but he requested a private\r\naudience, and it was probably accidental that the end of his personal\r\ncheck-book protruded a little from his pocket. He was a big,\r\ncoarse-grained man, Mr. Balch, who had once been a brakeman, and had\r\nrisen by what is known as horse sense to the presidency of his road.\r\nThere was a wonderful sunset beyond the Capitol, but Mr. Balch did not\r\ntalk about the sunset, although Jethro was watching it from behind the\r\ncurtains.\r\n\r\n\"If you are willing to undertake this fight against consolidation,\" said\r\nMr. Balch, \"we are ready to talk business with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"D-don't know what you're going to, do,\" answered Jethro; \"I'm going to\r\nprevent consolidation, if I can.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Balch, smiling. He regarded this reply as one of\r\nJethro's delicate euphemisms. \"We're prepared to give that same little\r\nretainer.\"\r\n\r\nJethro did not look up. Mr. Balch went to the table and seized a pen and\r\nfilled out a check for an amount that shall be nameless.\r\n\r\n\"I have made it payable to bearer, as usual,\" he said, and he handed it\r\nto Jethro.\r\n\r\nJethro took it, and absently tore it into little pieces, and threw the\r\npieces on the floor. Mr. Balch watched him in consternation. He began to\r\nthink the report that Jethro had reached his second childhood was true.\r\n\r\n\"What in Halifax are you doing, Bass?\" he cried.\r\n\r\n\"W-want to stop this consolidation, don't you--want' to stop it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"G-goin' to do all you can to stop it hain't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"I-I'll help you,\" said Jethro.\r\n\r\n\"Help us!\" exclaimed Balch. \"Great Scott, we want you to take charge of\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"I-I'll do all I can, but I won't guarantee it--w-won't guarantee it,\"\r\nsaid Jethro.\r\n\r\n\"We don't ask you to guarantee it. If you'll do all you can, that's\r\nenough. You won't take a retainer?\"\r\n\r\n\"W-won't take anything,\" said Jethro.\r\n\r\n\"You mean to say you don't want anything for your for your time and your\r\nservices if the bill is defeated?\"\r\n\r\n\"T-that's about it, Ed. Little p-private matter with both of us. You\r\ndon't want consolidation, and I don't. I hain't offered to give you a\r\nretainer--have I?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the astounded Mr. Balch. He scratched his head and fingered\r\nthe leaves of his check-book. The captains over the tens and the captains\r\nover the hundreds would want little retainers--and who was to pay these?\r\n\"How about the boys?\" asked Mr. Balch.\r\n\r\n\"S-still got the same office in the depot--hain't you, Ed, s-same\r\noffice?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"G-guess the boys hev b'en there before,\" said Jethro.\r\n\r\nMr. Balch went away, meditating upon those sayings, and took the train\r\nfor Boston. If he had waked up of a fine morning to find himself at the\r\nhead of some benevolent and charitable organization, instead of the \"Down\r\nEast\" Railroad, he could not have been more astonished than he had been\r\nat the unaccountable change of heart of Jethro Bass. He did not know what\r\nto make of it, and told his colleagues so; and at first they feared one\r\nof two things,--treachery or lunacy. But a little later a rumor reached\r\nMr. Balch's ears that Jethro's hatred of Isaac D. Worthington was at the\r\nbottom of his reappearance in public life, although Jethro himself never\r\nmentioned Mr. Worthington's name. Jethro sat in the Throne Room,\r\nconsulting, directing day after day, and when the Legislature assembled,\r\n\"the boys\" began to call at Mr. Balch's office. But Mr. Balch never again\r\nbroached the subject of money to Jethro Bass.\r\n\r\nWe have to sing the song of sixpence for the last time in these pages;\r\nand as it is an old song now, there will be no encores. If you can buy\r\none member of the lower house for ten dollars, how many members can you\r\nbuy for fifty? It was no such problem in primary arithmetic that Mr.\r\nBalch and his associates had to solve--theirs was in higher mathematics,\r\nin permutations and combinations, and in least squares. No wonder the old\r\ncampaigners speak with tears in their eyes of the days of that ever\r\nmemorable summer. There were spoils to be picked up in the very streets\r\nricher than the sack of the thirty cities; and as the session wore on it\r\nis affirmed by men still living that money rained down in the Capitol\r\nPark and elsewhere like manna from the skies, if you were one of a chosen\r\nband. If you were, all you had to do was to look in your vest pockets\r\nwhen you took your clothes off in the evening and extract enough legal\r\ntender to pay your bill at the Pelican for a week. Mr. Lovejoy having\r\nbeen overheard one day to make a remark concerning the diet of hogs, the\r\nnext morning certain visitors to the capital were horrified to discover\r\ntrails of corn leading from the Pelican House to their doorways. Men who\r\nhad never seen a receiving teller opened bank accounts. No, it was not a\r\nproblem in simple arithmetic, and Mr. Balch and Mr. Flint, and even Mr.\r\nDuncan and Mr. Worthington, covered whole sheets with figures during the\r\nstifling days in July. Some men are so valuable that they can be bought\r\ntwice, or even three times, and they make figuring complicated.\r\n\r\nJethro Bass did no calculating. He sat behind the curtains, and he must\r\nhave kept the figures in his head.\r\n\r\nThe battle had closed in earnest, and for twelve long, sultry weeks it\r\nraged with unabated fierceness. Consolidation had a terror for the rural\r\nmind, and the state Tribune skilfully played its stream upon the\r\nconstituents of those gentlemen who stood tamely at the Worthington\r\nhitching-posts, and the constituents flocked to the capital; that able\r\nnewspaper, too, found space to return, with interest, the attacks of Mr.\r\nWorthington's organ, the Newcastle Guardian. These amenities are much too\r\npersonal to reproduce here, now that the smoke of battle has rolled away.\r\nAn epic could be written upon the conflict, if there were space: Canto\r\nOne, the first position carried triumphantly, though at some expense, by\r\nthe Worthington forces, who elect the Speaker. That had been a crucial\r\ntime before the town meetings, when Jethro abdicated. The Worthington\r\nSpeaker goes ahead with his committees, and it is needless to say that\r\nMr. Chauncey Weed is not made Chairman of the Committee on Corporations.\r\nAs an offset to this, the Jethro forces gain on the extreme right, where\r\nthe Honorable Peleg Hartington is made President of the Senate, etc.\r\n\r\nFor twelve hot weeks, with a public spirit which is worthy of the highest\r\npraise, the Committee sit in their shirt sleeves all day long and listen\r\nto arguments for and against consolidation; and ask learned questions\r\nthat startle rural witnesses; and smoke big Florizel cigars (a majority\r\nof them). Judge Abner Parkinson defends his bill, quoting from the\r\nConstitution and the Declaration of Independence and the Bible; a\r\ncelebrated lawyer from the capital riddles it, using the same\r\nauthorities, and citing the Federalist and the Golden Rule in addition.\r\nThe Committee sit open-minded, listening with laudable impartiality; it\r\ndoes not become them to arrive at a hasty decision on a question of such\r\nmagnitude. In the meantime the House passes an important bill dealing\r\nwith the bounty on hedgehogs, and there are several card games going on\r\nin the cellar, where it is cool.\r\n\r\nThe governor of the state is a free lance, and may be seen any afternoon\r\nwalking through the park, consorting with no one. He may be recognized\r\neven at a distance by his portly figure, his silk hat, and his dignified\r\nmien. Yes, it is an old and valued friend, the Honorable Alva Hopkins,\r\npatron of the drama, and sometimes he has a beautiful young woman (still\r\nunattached) by his side. He lives in a suite of rooms at the Pelican. It\r\nis a well-known fact (among Mr. Worthington's supporters) that the\r\nHonorable Alva promised in January, when Mr. Bass retired, to sign the\r\nConsolidation Bill, and that he suddenly became open-minded in March, and\r\nhas remained open-minded ever since, listening gravely to arguments, and\r\ngiving much study to the subject. He is an executive now, although it is\r\nthe last year of his term, and of course he is never seen either in the\r\nThrone Room or the Railroad Room. And besides, he may become a senator.\r\n\r\nAugust has come, and the forces are spent and panting, and neither side\r\ndares to risk the final charge. The reputation of Jethro Bass is at\r\nstake. Should he risk and lose, he must go back to Coniston a beaten man,\r\nsubject to the contempt of his neighbors and his state. People do not\r\nknow that he has nothing now to go back to, and that he cares nothing for\r\ncontempt. As he sits in his window day after day he has only one thought\r\nand one wish,--to ruin Isaac D. Worthington. And he will do it if he can.\r\nThose who know--and among them is Mr. Balch himself--say that Jethro has\r\nnever conducted a more masterly campaign than this, and that all the\r\nothers have been mere childish trials of strength compared to it. So he\r\nsits there through those twelve weeks while the session slips by, while\r\nhis opponents grumble, and while even his supporters, eager for the\r\ncharge, complain. The truth is that in all the years of his activity be\r\nhas never had such an antagonist as Mr. Flint. Victory hangs in the\r\nbalance, and a false move will throw it to either side.\r\n\r\nVictory hangs now, to be explicit, upon two factors. The first and most\r\nimmediate of these is a certain canny captain of many wars whose regiment\r\nis still at the disposal of either army--for a price, a regiment which\r\nhas hitherto remained strictly neutral. And what a regiment it is! A\r\nblock of river towns and a senator, and not a casualty since they marched\r\nboldly into camp twelve weeks ago. Mr. Batch is getting very much worried\r\nabout this regiment, and beginning to doubt Jethro's judgment.\r\n\r\n\"I tell you, Bass,\" he said one evening, \"if you allow him to run around\r\nloose much longer, we're lost, that's all there is to it!\" (Mr. Batch\r\nreferred to the captain in question.) \"They'll buy up his block at his\r\nfigure--see, if they don't. They're getting desperate. Don't you think\r\nI'd better bid him in?\"\r\n\r\n\"B-bid him in if you've a mind to; Ed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Jethro,\" said Mr. Batch, savagely biting off the end of a\r\ncigar, \"I'm beginning to think you don't care a continental about this\r\nbusiness. Which side are you on, anyway?\" The heat and the length and the\r\nuncertainty of the struggle were telling on the nerves of the railroad\r\npresident. \"You sit there from morning till night and won't say anything;\r\nand now, when there's only one block out, you won't give the word to buy\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"N-never told you to buy anything, did I--Ed?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered Mr. Batch, \"you haven't. I don't know what the devil's got\r\ninto you.\"\r\n\r\n\"D-done all the payin' without consultin' me, hain't you, Ed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; I have. What are you driving at?\"\r\n\r\n\"D-done it if I hadn't b'en here, wouldn't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and more too,\" said Mr. Batch.\r\n\r\n\"W-wouldn't make much difference to you if I wasn't here--would it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Great Scott, Jethro, what do you mean?\" cried the railroad president, in\r\ngenuine alarm; \"you're not going to pull out, are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"W-wouldn't make much odds if I did--would it, Ed?\"\r\n\r\n\"The devil it wouldn't!\" exclaimed Mr. Balch. \"If you pulled out, we'd\r\nlose the North Country, and Peleg, and Gosport, and nobody can tell which\r\nway Alva Hopkins will swing. I guess you know what he'll do--you're so\r\nd--d secretive I can't tell whether you do or not. If you pulled out,\r\nthey'd have their bill on Friday.\"\r\n\r\n\"H-hain't under any obligations to you, Ed--am I?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Mr. Batch, \"but I don't see why you keep harping on that.\"\r\n\r\n\"J-dust wanted to have it clear,\" said Jethro, and relapsed into silence.\r\n\r\nThere was a fireproof carpet on the Throne Room, and Mr. Batch flung down\r\nhis cigar and stamped on it and went out. No wonder he could not\r\nunderstand Jethro's sudden scruples about money and obligations--about\r\nrailroad money, that is. Jethro was spending some of his own, but not in\r\nthe capital, and in a manner which was most effective. In short, at the\r\nvery moment when Mr. Batch stamped on his cigar, Jethro had the victory\r\nin his hands--only he did not choose to say so. He had had a mysterious\r\ntelegram that day from Harwich, signed by Chauncey Weed, and Mr. Weed\r\nhimself appeared at the door of Number 7, fresh from his travels, shortly\r\nafter Mr. Batch had gone out of it. Mr. Weed closed the door gently, and\r\nlocked it, and sat down in a rocking chair close to Jethro and put his\r\nhand over his mouth. We cannot hear what Mr. Weed is saying. All is\r\nmystery here, and in order to preserve that mystery we shall delay for a\r\nlittle the few words which will explain Mr. Weed's successful mission.\r\n\r\nMr. Batch, angry and bewildered, descended into the rotunda, where he\r\nshortly heard two astounding pieces of news. The first was that the\r\nHonorable Heth Sutton had abandoned the Florizel cigars and had gone home\r\nto Clovelly. The second; that Mr. Bijah Bixby had resigned the\r\nclaw-hammer and had ceased to open the packing cases in the Railroad\r\nRoom. Consternation reigned in that room, so it was said (and this was\r\ntrue). Mr. Worthington and Mr. Duncan and Mr. Lovejoy were closeted there\r\nwith Mr. Flint, and the door was locked and the transom shut, and smoke\r\nwas coming out of the windows.\r\n\r\nYes, Mr. Bijah Bixby is the canny captain of whom Mr. Balch spoke: he it\r\nis who owns that block of river towns, intact, and the one senator.\r\nImpossible! We have seen him opening the packing cases, we have seen him\r\nworking for the Worthington faction for the last two years. Mr. Bixby was\r\nvery willing to open boxes, and to make himself useful and agreeable; but\r\nit must be remembered that a good captain of mercenaries owes a sacred\r\nduty to his followers. At first Mr. Flint had thought he could count on\r\nMr. Bixby; after a while he made several unsuccessful attempts to talk\r\nbusiness with him; a particularly difficult thing to do, even for Mr.\r\nFlint, when Mr. Bixby did not wish to talk business. Mr. Balch had found\r\nit quite as difficult to entice Mr. Bixby away from the boxes and the\r\nRailroad Room. The weeks drifted on, until twelve went by, and then Mr.\r\nBixby found himself, with his block of river towns and one senator, in\r\nthe incomparable position of being the arbiter of the fate of the\r\nConsolidation Bill in the House and Senate. No wonder Mr. Balch wanted to\r\nbuy the services of that famous regiment at any price!\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Bixby, for once in his life, had waited too long.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Balch, rejoicing, but not a little indignant at not having been\r\ntaken into confidence, ascended to the Throne Room after supper to\r\nquestion Jethro concerning the meaning of the things he had heard, he\r\nfound Senator Peleg Hartington seated mournfully on the bed, talking at\r\nintervals, and Jethro listening.\r\n\r\n\"Come up and eat out of my hand,\" said the senator.\r\n\r\n\"Who?\" demanded Mr. Balch.\r\n\r\n\"Bije,\" answered the senator.\r\n\r\n\"Great Scott, do you mean to say you've got Bixby?\" exclaimed the\r\nrailroad president. He felt as if he would like to shake the senator, who\r\nwas so deliberate and mournful in his answers. \"What did you pay him?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hartington appeared shocked by the question.\r\n\r\n\"Guess Heth Sutton will settle with him,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Heth Sutton! Why the--why should Heth pay him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Guess Heth'd like to make him a little present, under the circumstances.\r\nI was goin' through the barber shop,\" Mr. Hartington continued, speaking\r\nto Jethro and ignoring the railroad president, \"and I heard somebody\r\nwhisperin' my name. Sound came out of that little shampoo closet; went in\r\nthere and found Bije. 'Peleg,' says he, right into my ear, 'tell Jethro\r\nit's all right--you understand. We want Heth to go back--break his heart\r\nif he didn't--you understand. If I'd knowed last winter Jethro meant\r\nbusiness, I wouldn't hev' helped Gus Flint out. Tell Jethro he can have\r\n'em--you know what I mean.' Bije waited a little mite too long,\" said the\r\nsenator, who had given a very fair imitation of Mr. Bixby's nasal voice\r\nand manner.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm d--d!\" ejaculated Mr. Balch, staring at Jethro. \"How did you\r\nwork it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sent Chauncey through the deestrict,\" said Mr. Hartington.\r\n\r\nMr. Chauncey Weed had, in truth, gone through a part of the congressional\r\ndistrict of the Honorable Heth Sutton with a little leather bag. Mr. Weed\r\nhad been able to do some of his work (with the little leather bag) in the\r\ncapital itself. In this way Mr. Bixby's regiment, Sutton was the honorary\r\ncolonel, had been attacked in the rear and routed. Here was to be a\r\ncongressional convention that autumn, and a large part of Mr. Sutton's\r\ndistrict lay in the North Country, which, as we have seen, was loyal to\r\nJethro to the back bone. The district, too, was largely rural, and\r\ntherefore anti-consolidation, and the inability of the Worthington forces\r\nto get their bill through had made it apparent that Jethro Bass was as\r\npowerful as ever. Under these circumstances it had not been very\r\ndifficult for a gentleman of Mr. Chauncey Weed's powers of persuasion to\r\ninduce various lieutenants in the district to agree to send delegates to\r\nthe coming convention who would be conscientiously opposed to Mr.\r\nSutton's renomination: hence the departure from the capital of Mr.\r\nSutton; hence the generous offer of Mr. Bixby to put his regiment at the\r\ndisposal of Mr. Bass--free of charge.\r\n\r\nThe second factor on which victory hung (we can use the past tense now)\r\nwas none other than his Excellency Alva Hopkins, governor of the state.\r\nThe bill would never get to his Excellency now--so people said; would\r\nnever get beyond that committee who had listened so patiently to the\r\ntwelve weeks of argument. These were only rumors, after all, for the\r\nrotunda never knows positively what goes on in high circles; but the\r\nrotunda does figuring, too, when at length the problem is reduced to a\r\nsimple equation, with Bijah Bixby as x. If it were true that Bijah had\r\ngone over to Jethro Bass, the Consolidation Bill was dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nWhen Jethro Bass walked out of the hotel that evening men looked at him,\r\nand made way for him, but none spoke to him. There was something in his\r\nface that forbade speech. He was a great man once more--a greater man\r\nthan ever; and he had, if the persistent rumors were true, accomplished\r\nan almost incomprehensible feat, even for Jethro Bass. There was another\r\nreason, too, why they stared at him. In all those twelve weeks of that\r\nmost trying of all sessions he had not once gone into the street, and he\r\nhad been less than ever common in the eyes of men. Twice a day he had\r\ndescended to the dining room for a simple meal--that was all; and fewer\r\nhad gained entrance to Room Number 7 this session than ever before.\r\n\r\nThere is a river that flows by the capital, a wide and gentle river\r\nbordered by green meadows and fringed with willows; higher up, if you go\r\nfar enough, a forest comes down to the water on the western side. Jethro\r\nwalked through the hooded bridge, and up the eastern bank until he could\r\nsee the forest like a black band between the orange sky and the orange\r\nriver, and there he sat down upon a fallen log on the edge of the bank.\r\nBut Jethro was thinking of another scene,--of a granite-ribbed pasture on\r\nConiston Mountain that swings in limitless space, from either end of\r\nwhich a man may step off into eternity. William Wetherell, in one of his\r\nletters, had described that place as the Threshold of the Nameless\r\nWorlds, and so it had seemed to Jethro in the years of his desolation. He\r\nwas thinking of it now, even as it had been in his mind that winter's\r\nevening when Cynthia had come to Coniston and had surprised him with that\r\nlook of terrible loneliness on his face.\r\n\r\nYes, and he was thinking of Cynthia. When, indeed, had he not been\r\nthinking of her? How many tunes had he rehearsed the events in the\r\ntannery house--for they were the events of his life now. The triumphs\r\nover his opponents and enemies fell away, and the pride of power. Such\r\nhad not been his achievements. She had loved him, and no man had reached\r\na higher pinnacle than that.\r\n\r\nWhy he had forfeited that love for vengeance, he could not tell. The\r\nembers of a man's passions will suddenly burst into flame, and he will\r\nfiddle madly while the fire burns his soul. He had avenged her as well as\r\nhimself; but had he avenged her, now that he held Isaac Worthington in\r\nhis power? By crushing him, had he not added to her trouble and her\r\nsorrow? She had confessed that she loved Isaac Worthington's son, and was\r\nnot he (Jethro) widening the breach between Cynthia and the son by\r\ncrushing the father? Jethro had not thought of this. But he had thought\r\nof her, night and day, as he had sat in his room directing the battle.\r\nNot a day had passed that he had not looked for a letter, hoping against\r\nhope. If she had written to him once, if she had come to him once, would\r\nhe have desisted? He could not say--the fires of hatred had burned so\r\nfiercely, and still burned so fiercely, that he clenched his fists when\r\nit came over him that Isaac Worthington was at last in his power.\r\n\r\nA white line above the forest was all that remained of the sunset when he\r\nrose up and took from his coat a silver locket and opened it and held it\r\nto the fading light. Presently he closed it again, and walked slowly\r\nalong the river bank toward the little city twinkling on its hill. He\r\ncrossed the hooded bridge and climbed the slope, stopping for a moment at\r\na little stationery shop; he passed through the groups which were still\r\nloudly discussing this thing he had done, and gained his room and locked\r\nthe door. Men came to it and knocked and got no answer. The room was in\r\ndarkness, and the night breeze stirred among the trees in the park and\r\nblew in at the window.\r\n\r\nAt last Jethro got up and lighted the gas and paused at the centre table.\r\nHe was to violate more than one principle of his life that night, though\r\nnot without a struggle; and he sat for a long while looking at the blank\r\npaper before him. Then he wrote, and sealed the letter--which contained\r\nthree lines--and pulled the bell cord. The call was answered by a\r\nmessenger who had been far many years in the service of the Pelican\r\nHouse, and who knew many secrets of the gods. The man actually grew pale\r\nwhen he saw the address on the envelope which was put in his hand and\r\nread the denomination of the crisp note under it that was the price of\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n\"F-find the gentleman and give it to him yourself. Er--John?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Mr. Bass?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you don't find him, bring it--back.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the man had gone, Jethro turned down the gas and went again to his\r\nchair by the window. For a while voices came up to him from the street,\r\nbut at length the groups dispersed, one by one; and a distant clock\r\nboomed out eleven solemn strokes. Twice the clock struck again, at the\r\nhalf-hour and midnight, and the noises in the house--the banging of doors\r\nand the jangling of keys and the hurrying of feet in the corridors--were\r\nhushed. Jethro took no thought of these or of time, and sat gazing at the\r\nstars in the depths of the sky above the capital dome until a shadow\r\nemerged from the black mass of the trees opposite and crossed the street.\r\nIn a few minutes there were footsteps in the corridor,--stealthy\r\nfootsteps--and a knock on the door. Jethro got up and opened it, and\r\nclosed it again and locked it. Then he turned up the gas.\r\n\r\n\"S-sit down,\" he said, and nodded his head toward the chair by the table.\r\n\r\nIsaac Worthington laid his silk hat on the table, and sat down. He looked\r\nvery haggard and worn in that light, very unlike the first citizen who\r\nhad entered Brampton in triumph on his return from the West not many\r\nmonths before. The long strain of a long fight, in which he had risked\r\nmuch for which he had labored a life to gain, had told on him, and there\r\nwere crow's-feet at the corners of, his eyes, and dark circles under\r\nthem. Isaac Worthington had never lost before, and to destroy the fruits\r\nof such a man's ambition is to destroy the man. He was not as young as he\r\nhad once been. But now, in the very hour of defeat, hope had rekindled\r\nthe fire in the eyes and brought back the peculiar, tight-lipped, mocking\r\nsmile to the mouth. An hour ago, when he had been pacing Alexander\r\nDuncan's library, the eyes and the mouth had been different.\r\n\r\nLong habit asserts itself at the strangest moments. Jethro Bass took his\r\nseat by the window, and remained silent. The clock tolled the half-hour\r\nafter midnight.\r\n\r\n\"You wanted to see me,\" said Mr. Worthington, finally.\r\n\r\nJethro nodded, almost imperceptibly.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose,\" said Mr. Worthington, slowly, \"I suppose you are ready to\r\nsell out.\" He found it a little difficult to control his voice.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Jethro, \"r-ready to sell out.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington was somewhat taken aback by this simple admission. He\r\nglanced at Jethro sitting motionless by the window, and in his heart he\r\nfeared him: he had come into that room when the gas was low, afraid.\r\nAlthough he would not confess it to himself, he had been in fear of\r\nJethro Bass all his life, and his fear had been greater than ever since\r\nthe March day when Jethro had left Coniston. And could he have known,\r\nnow, the fires of hatred burning in Jethro's breast, Isaac Worthington\r\nwould have been in terror indeed.\r\n\r\n\"What have you got to sell?\" he demanded sharply.\r\n\r\n\"G-guess you know, or you wouldn't have come here.\"\r\n\r\n\"What proof have I that you have it to sell?\"\r\n\r\nJethro looked at him for an instant.\r\n\r\n\"M-my word,\" he said.\r\n\r\nIsaac Worthington was silent for a while: he was striving to calm\r\nhimself, for an indefinable something had shaken him. The strange\r\nstillness of the hour and the stranger atmosphere which seemed to\r\nsurround this transaction filled him with a nameless dread. The man in\r\nthe window had been his lifelong enemy: more than this, Jethro Bass, was\r\nnot like ordinary men--his ways were enshrouded in mystery, and when he\r\nstruck, he struck hard. There grew upon Isaac Worthington a sense that\r\nthis midnight hour was in some way to be the culmination of the long\r\nyears of hatred between them.\r\n\r\nHe believed Jethro: he would have believed him even if Mr. Flint had not\r\ninformed him that afternoon that he was beaten, and bitterly he wished he\r\nhad taken Mr. Flint's advice many months before. Denunciation sprang to\r\nhis lips which he dared not utter. He was beaten, and he must pay--the\r\npound of flesh. Isaac Worthington almost thought it would be a pound of\r\nflesh.\r\n\r\n\"How much do you want?\" he said.\r\n\r\nAgain Jethro looked at him.\r\n\r\n\"B-biggest price you can pay,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"You must have made up your mind what you want. You've had time enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"H-have made up my mind,\" said Jethro.\r\n\r\n\"Make your demand,\" said Mr. Worthington, \"and I'll give you my answer.\"\r\n\r\n\"B-biggest price you can pay,\" said Jethro, again.\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington's nerves could stand it no longer.\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" he cried, rising in his chair, \"if you've brought me here to\r\ntrifle with me, you've made a mistake. It's your business to get control\r\nof things that belong to other people, and sell them out. I am here to\r\nbuy. Nothing but necessity brings me here, and nothing but necessity will\r\nkeep me here a moment longer than I have to stay to finish this\r\nabominable affair. I am ready to pay you twenty thousand dollars the day\r\nthat bill becomes a law.\"\r\n\r\nThis time Jethro did not look at him.\r\n\r\n\"P-pay me now,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I will pay you the day the bill becomes a law. Then I shall know where I\r\nstand.\"\r\n\r\nJethro did not answer this ultimatum in any manner, but remained\r\nperfectly still looking out of the window. Mr. Worthington glanced at\r\nhim, twice, and got his fingers on the brim of his hat, but he did not\r\npick it up. He stood so for a while, knowing full well that if he went\r\nout of that room his chance was gone. Consolidation might come in other\r\nyears, but he, Isaac Worthington, would not be a factor in it.\r\n\r\n\"You don't want a check, do you?\" he said at last.\r\n\r\n\"No--d-don't want a check.\"\r\n\r\n\"What in God's name do you want? I haven't got twenty thousand dollars in\r\ncurrency in my pocket.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sit down, Isaac Worthington,\" said Jethro.\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington sat down--out of sheer astonishment, perhaps.\r\n\r\n\"W-want the consolidation--don't you? Want it bad--don't you?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington did, not answer. Jethro stood over him now, looking down\r\nat him from the other side of the narrow table.\r\n\r\n\"Know Cynthy Wetherell?\" he said.\r\n\r\nThen Isaac Worthington understood that his premonitions had been real.\r\nThe pound of flesh was to be demanded, but strangely enough, he did not\r\nyet comprehend the nature of it.\r\n\r\n\"I know that there is such a person,\" he answered, for his pride would\r\nnot permit him to say more.\r\n\r\n\"W-what do you know about her?\"\r\n\r\nIsaac Worthington was bitterly angry--the more so because he was\r\nhelpless, and could not question Jethro's right to ask. What did he know\r\nabout her? Nothing, except that she had intrigued to marry his son. Bob's\r\nletter had described her, to be sure, but he could not be expected to\r\nbelieve that: and he had not heard Miss Lucretia Penniman's speech. And\r\nyet he could not tell Jethro that he knew nothing about her, for he was\r\nshrewd enough to perceive the drift of the next question.\r\n\r\n\"Kn-know anything against her?\" said Jethro.\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington leaned back in his chair.\r\n\r\n\"I can't see what Miss Wetherell has to do with the present occasion,\" he\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n\"H-had her dismissed by the prudential committee had her\r\ndismissed--didn't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"They chose to act as they saw fit.\"\r\n\r\n\"T-told Levi Dodd to dismiss her--didn't you?\"\r\n\r\nThat was a matter of common knowledge in Brampton, having leaked out\r\nthrough Jonathan Hill.\r\n\r\n\"I must decline to discuss this,\" said Mr. Worthington.\r\n\r\n\"W-wouldn't if I was you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"What I say. T-told Levi Dodd to dismiss her, didn't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I did.\" Isaac Worthington had lost in self-esteem by not saying so\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\"Why? Wahn't she honest? Wahn't she capable? Wahn't she a lady?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't say that I know anything against Miss Wetherell's character, if\r\nthat's what you mean.\"\r\n\r\n\"F-fit to teach--wahn't she--fit to teach?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe she has since qualified before Mr. Errol.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fit to teach--wahn't fit to marry your son--was she?\"\r\n\r\nIsaac Worthington clutched the table and started from his chair. He grew\r\nwhite to his lips with anger, and yet he knew that he must control\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Bass,\" he said, \"you have something to sell, and I have something to\r\nbuy--if the price is not ruinous. Let us confine ourselves to that. My\r\naffairs and my son's affairs are neither here nor there. I ask you again,\r\nhow much do you want for this Consolidation Bill?\"\r\n\r\n\"N-no money will buy it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\"\r\n\r\n\"C-consent to this marriage, c-consent to this marriage.\" There was yet\r\nroom for Isaac Worthington to be amazed, and for a while he stared up at\r\nJethro, speechless.\r\n\r\n\"Is that your price?\" he asked at last.\r\n\r\n\"Th-that's my price,\" said Jethro.\r\n\r\nIsaac Worthington got up and went to the window and stood looking out\r\nabove the black mass of trees at the dome outlined against the\r\nstar-flecked sky. At first his anger choked him, and he could not think;\r\nhe had just enough reason left not to walk out of the door. But presently\r\nhabit asserted itself in him, too, and he began to reflect and calculate\r\nin spite of his anger. It is strange that memory plays so small a part in\r\nsuch a man. Before he allowed his mind to dwell on the fearful price, he\r\nthought of his ambitions gratified; and yet he did not think then of the\r\nwoman to whom he had once confided those ambitions--the woman who was the\r\ngirl's mother. Perhaps Jethro was thinking of her.\r\n\r\nIt may have been--I know not--that Isaac Worthington wondered at this\r\nrevelation of the character of Jethro Bass, for it was a revelation. For\r\nthis girl's sake Jethro was willing to forego his revenge, was willing at\r\nthe end of his days to allow the world to believe that he had sold out to\r\nhis enemy, or that he had been defeated by him.\r\n\r\nBut when he thought of the marriage, Isaac Worthington ground his teeth.\r\nA certain sentiment which we may call pride was so strong in him that he\r\nfelt ready to make almost any sacrifice to prevent it. To hinder it he\r\nhad quarrelled with his son, and driven him away, and threatened\r\ndisinheritance. The price was indeed heavy--the heaviest he could pay.\r\nBut the alternative--was not that heavier? To relinquish his dream of\r\npower, to sink for a while into a crippled state; for he had spent large\r\nsums, and one of those periodical depressions had come in the business of\r\nthe mills, and those Western investments were not looking so bright now.\r\n\r\nSo, with his hands opening and closing in front of him, Isaac Worthington\r\nfought out his battle. A terrible war, that, between ambition and\r\npride--a war to the knife. The issue may yet have been undecided when he\r\nturned round to Jethro with a sneer which he could not resist.\r\n\r\n\"Why doesn't she marry him without my consent?\"\r\n\r\nIn a moment Mr. Worthington knew he had gone too far. A certain kind of\r\nan eye is an incomparable weapon, and armed men have been cowed by those\r\nwho possess it, though otherwise defenceless. Jethro Bass had that kind\r\nof an eye.\r\n\r\n\"G-guess you wouldn't understand if I was to tell you,\" he said.\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington walked to the window again, perhaps to compose himself,\r\nand then came back again.\r\n\r\n\"Your proposition is,\" he said at length, \"that if I give my consent to\r\nthis marriage, we are to have Bixby and the governor, and the\r\nConsolidation Bill will become a law. Is that it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Th-that's it,\" said Jethro, taking his accustomed seat.\r\n\r\n\"And this consent is to be given when the bill becomes a law?\"\r\n\r\n\"Given now. T-to-night.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington took another turn as far as the door, and suddenly came\r\nand stood before Jethro.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I consent.\"\r\n\r\nJethro nodded toward the table.\r\n\r\n\"Er--pen and paper there,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want me to do?\" demanded Mr. Worthington.\r\n\r\n\"W-write to Bob--write to Cynthy. Nice letters.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is carrying matters with too high a hand, Mr. Bass. I will write\r\nthe letters to-morrow morning.\" It was intolerable that he, the first\r\ncitizen of Brampton, should have to submit to such humiliation.\r\n\r\n\"Write 'em now. W-want to see 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if I give you my word they will be written and sent to you to-morrow\r\nafternoon?\"\r\n\r\n\"T-too late,\" said Jethro; \"sit down and write 'em now.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington went irresolutely to the table, stood for a minute, and\r\ndropped suddenly into the chair there. He would have given anything\r\n(except the realization of his ambitions) to have marched out of the room\r\nand to have slammed the door behind him. The letter paper and envelopes\r\nwhich Jethro had bought stood in a little pile, and Mr. Worthington\r\npicked up the pen. The clock struck two as he wrote the date, as though\r\nto remind him that he had written it wrong. If Flint could see him now!\r\nWould Flint guess? Would anybody guess? He stared at the white paper, and\r\nhis rage came on again like a gust of wind, and he felt that he would\r\nrather beg in the streets than write such a thing. And yet--and yet he\r\nsat there. Surely Jethro Bass must have known that he could have taken no\r\nmore exquisite vengeance than this, to compel a man--and such a man--to\r\nsit down in the white heat of passion--and write two letters of\r\nforgiveness! Jethro sat by the window, to all appearances oblivious to\r\nthe tortures of his victim.\r\n\r\nHe who has tried to write a note--the simplest note when his mind was\r\nharassed, will understand something of Isaac Worthington's sensations. He\r\nwould no sooner get an inkling of what his opening sentence was to be\r\nthan the flames of his anger would rise and sweep it away. He could not\r\neven decide which letter he was to write first: to his son, who had\r\ndefied him and who (the father knew in his heart) condemned him? or to\r\nthe schoolteacher, who was responsible for all his misery; who--Mr.\r\nWorthington believed--had taken advantage of his son's youth by feminine\r\nwiles of no mean order so as to gain possession of him. I can almost\r\nbring myself to pity the first citizen of Brampton as he sits there with\r\nhis pen poised over the paper, and his enemy waiting to read those tender\r\nepistles of forgiveness which he has yet to write. The clock has almost\r\ngot round to the half-hour again, and there is only the date--and a wrong\r\none at that.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Miss Wetherell,--Circumstances (over which I have no\r\ncontrol?)\"--ought he not to call her Cynthia? He has to make the letter\r\ncredible in the eyes of the censor who sits by the window. \"My dear Miss\r\nWetherell, I have come to the conclusion\"--two sheets torn up, or thrust\r\ninto Mr. Worthington's pocket. By this time words have begun to have a\r\ncolorless look. \"My dear Miss Wetherell,--Having become convinced of the\r\nsincere attachment which my son Robert has for you, I am writing him\r\nto-night to give my full consent to his marriage. He has given me to\r\nunderstand that you have hitherto persistently refused to accept him\r\nbecause I have withheld that consent, and I take this opportunity of\r\nexpressing my admiration of this praiseworthy resolution on your part.\"\r\n(If this be irony, it is sublime! Perhaps Isaac Worthington has a little\r\nof the artist in him, and now that he is in the heat of creation has\r\nforgotten the circumstances under which he is composing.) \"My son's\r\nhappiness and career in life are of such moment to me that, until the\r\npresent, I could not give my sanction to what I at first regarded as a\r\nyouthful fancy. Now that, my son, for your sake, has shown his\r\ndetermination and ability to make his own way in the world,\" (Isaac\r\nWorthington was not a little proud of this) \"I have determined that it is\r\nwise to withdraw my opposition, and to recall Robert to his proper place,\r\nwhich is near me. I am sure that my feelings in this matter will be clear\r\nto you, and that you will look with indulgence upon any acts of mine\r\nwhich sprang from a natural solicitation for the welfare and happiness of\r\nmy only child. I shall be in Brampton in a day or two, and I shall at\r\nonce give myself the pleasure of calling on you. Sincerely yours, Isaac\r\nD. Worthington.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps a little formal and pompous for some people, but an admirable and\r\nconciliatory letter for the first citizen of Brampton. Written under such\r\ntrying circumstances, with I know not how many erasures and false starts,\r\nit is little short of a marvel in art: neither too much said, nor too\r\nlittle, for a relenting parent of Mr. Worthington's character, and I\r\ndoubt whether Talleyrand or Napoleon or even Machiavelli himself could\r\nhave surpassed it. The second letter, now that Mr. Worthington had got\r\ninto the swing, was more easily written. \"My dear Robert\" (it said), \"I\r\nhave made up my mind to give my consent to your marriage to Miss\r\nWetherell, and I am ready to welcome you home, where I trust I shall see\r\nyou shortly. I have not been unimpressed by the determined manner in\r\nwhich you have gone to work for yourself, but I believe that your place\r\nis in Brampton, where I trust you will show the same energy in learning\r\nto succeed me in the business which I have founded there as you have\r\nexhibited in Mr. Broke's works. Affectionately, your Father.\"\r\n\r\nA very creditable and handsome letter for a forgiving father. When Mr.\r\nWorthington had finished it, and had addressed both the envelopes, his\r\nshame and vexation had, curious to relate, very considerably abated. Not\r\nto go too deeply into the somewhat contradictory mental and cardiac\r\nprocesses of Mr. Worthington, he had somehow tricked himself by that\r\nmagic exercise of wielding his pen into thinking that he was doing a\r\nnoble and generous action: into believing that in the course of a very\r\nfew days--or weeks, at the most, he would have recalled his erring son\r\nand have given Cynthia his blessing. He would, he told himself, have been\r\nforced eventually to yield when that paragon of inflexibility, Bob,\r\ndictated terms to him at the head of the locomotive works. Better let the\r\ngenerosity be on his (Mr. Worthington's) side. At all events, victory had\r\nnever been bought more cheaply. Humiliation, in Mr. Worthington's eyes,\r\nhad an element of publicity in it, and this episode had had none of that\r\nelement; and Jethro Bass, moreover, was a highwayman who had held a\r\npistol to his head. In such logical manner he gradually bolstered up\r\nagain his habitual poise and dignity. Next week, at the latest, men would\r\npoint to him as the head of the largest railroad interests in the state.\r\n\r\nHe pushed back his chair, and rose, merely indicating the result of his\r\nlabors by a wave of his hand. And he stood in the window as Jethro Bass\r\ngot up and went to the table. I would that I had a pen able to describe\r\nJethro's sensations when he read them. Unfortunately, he is a man with\r\nfew facial expressions. But I believe that he was artist enough himself\r\nto appreciate the perfections of the first citizen's efforts. After a\r\nmuch longer interval than was necessary for their perusal, Mr.\r\nWorthington turned.\r\n\r\n\"G-guess they'll do,\" said Jethro, as he folded them up. He was too\r\ngenerous not to indulge, for once, in a little well-deserved praise.\r\n\"Hain't underdone it, and hain't overdone it a mite hev you? M-man of\r\nresource. Callate you couldn't hev beat that if you was to take a week to\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it only fair to tell you,\" said Mr. Worthington, picking up his\r\nsilk hat, \"that in those letters I have merely anticipated a very little\r\nmy intentions in the matter. My son having proved his earnestness, I was\r\nabout to consent to the marriage of my own accord.\"\r\n\r\n\"G-goin' to do it anyway--was you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I had so determined.\"\r\n\r\n\"A-always thought you was high-minded,\" said Jethro.\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington was on the point of giving a tart reply to this, but\r\nrestrained himself.\r\n\r\n\"Then I may look upon the matter as settled?\" he said. \"The Consolidation\r\nBill is to become a law?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Jethro, \"you'll get your bill.\" Mr. Worthington had got his\r\nhand on the knob of the door when Jethro stopped him with a word. He had\r\nno facial expressions, but he had an eye, as we have seen--an eye that\r\nfor the second time appeared terrible to his visitor. \"Isaac\r\nWorthington,\" he said, \"a-act up to it. No trickery--or look out--look\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\nThen, the incident being closed so far as he was concerned, Jethro went\r\nback to his chair by the window, but it is to be recorded that Isaac\r\nWorthington did not answer him immediately. Then he said:--\r\n\r\n\"You seem to forget that you are talking to a gentleman.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so,\" answered Jethro, \"so you be.\"\r\n\r\nHe sat where he was long after the sky had whitened and the stars had\r\nchanged from gold to silver and gone out, and the sunlight had begun to\r\nglance upon the green leaves of the park. Perhaps he was thinking of the\r\nlife he had lived, which was spent now: of the men he had ruled, of the\r\nvictories he had gained from that place which would know him no more. He\r\nhad won the last and the greatest of his victories there, compared to\r\nwhich the others had indeed been as vanities. Perhaps he looked back over\r\nthe highway of his life and thought of the woman whom he had loved, and\r\nwondered what it had been if she had trod it by his side. Who will judge\r\nhim? He had been what he had been; and as the Era was, so was he. Verily,\r\none generation passeth away, and another generation cometh.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Isaac Worthington arrived at Mr. Duncan's house, where he was\r\nstaying, at three o'clock in the morning, he saw to his surprise light\r\nfrom the library windows lying in bars across the lawn under the trees.\r\nHe found Mr. Duncan in that room with Somers, his son, who had just\r\nreturned from a seaside place, and they were discussing a very grave\r\nevent. Miss Janet Duncan had that day eloped with a gentleman who--to\r\njudge from the photograph Somers held--was both handsome and\r\nromantic-looking. He had long hair and burning eyes, and a title not to\r\nbe then verified, and he owned a castle near some place on the peninsula\r\nof Italy not on the map.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nWe are back in Brampton, owning, as we do, an annual pass over the Truro\r\nRailroad. Cynthia has been there all the summer, and as it is now the\r\nfirst of September, her school has begun again. I do not by any means\r\nintend to imply that Brampton is not a pleasant place to spend the\r\nsummer: the number of its annual visitors is a refutation of that; but to\r\nCynthia the season had been one of great unhappiness. Several times Lem\r\nHallowell had stopped the stage in front of Ephraim's house to beg her to\r\ngo to Coniston, and Mr. Satterlee had come himself; but she could not\r\nhave borne to be there without Jethro. Nor would she go to Boston, though\r\nurged by Miss Lucretia; and Mrs. Merrill and the girls had implored her\r\nto join them at a seaside place on the Cape.\r\n\r\nCynthia had made a little garden behind Ephraim's house, and she spent\r\nthe summer there with her flowers and her books, many of which Lem had\r\nfetched from Coniston. Ephraim loved to sit there of an evening and smoke\r\nhis pipe and chat with Ezra Graves and the neighbors who dropped in.\r\nAmong these were Mr. Gamaliel Ives, who talked literature with Cynthia;\r\nand Lucy Baird, his wife, who had taken Cynthia under her wing. I wish I\r\nhad time to write about Lucy Baird. And Mr. Jonathan Hill came--his\r\nmortgage not having been foreclosed, after all. When Cynthia was alone\r\nwith Ephraim she often read to him,--generally from books of a martial\r\nflavor,--and listened with an admirable hypocrisy to certain narratives\r\nwhich he was in the habit of telling.\r\n\r\nThey never spoke of Jethro. Ephraim was not a casuist, and his sense of\r\nright and wrong came largely through his affections. It is safe to say\r\nthat he never made an analysis of the sorrow which he knew was afflicting\r\nthe girl, but he had had a general and most sympathetic understanding of\r\nit ever since the time when Jethro had gone back to the capital; and\r\nEphraim never brought home his Guardian or his Clarion now, but read them\r\nat the office, that their contents might not disturb her.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that Cynthia was unhappy. The letters came, almost every day,\r\nwith the postmark of the town in New Jersey where Mr. Broke's locomotive\r\nworks were; and she answered them now (but oh, how scrupulously!), though\r\nnot every day. If the waters of love rose up through the grains of sand,\r\nit was, at least, not Cynthia's fault. Hers were the letters of a friend.\r\nShe was reading such and such a book--had he read it? And he must not\r\nwork too hard. How could her letters be otherwise when Jethro Bass, her\r\nbenefactor, was at the capital working to defeat and perhaps to ruin\r\nBob's father? when Bob's father had insulted and persecuted her? She\r\nought not to have written at all; but the lapses of such a heroine are\r\nvery rare, and very dear.\r\n\r\nYes, Cynthia's life was very bitter that summer, with but little hope on\r\nthe horizon of it. Her thoughts were divided between Bob and Jethro. Many\r\na night she lay awake resolving to write to Jethro, even to go to him,\r\nbut when morning came she could not bring herself to do so. I do not\r\nthink it was because she feared that he might believe her appeal would be\r\nmade in behalf of Bob's father. Knowing Jethro as she did, she felt that\r\nit would be useless, and she could not bear to make it in vain; if the\r\nmemory of that evening in the tannery shed would not serve, nothing would\r\nserve. And again--he had gone to avenge her.\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable that she should hear tidings from the capital. Isaac\r\nWorthington's own town was ringing with it. And as week after week of\r\nthat interminable session went by, the conviction slowly grew upon\r\nBrampton that its first citizen had been beaten by Jethro Bass. Something\r\nof Mr. Worthington's affairs was known: the mills, for instance, were not\r\nbeing run to their full capacity. And then had come the definite news\r\nthat Mr. Worthington was beaten, a local representative having arrived\r\nstraight from the rotunda. Cynthia overheard Lem Hallowell telling it to\r\nEphraim, and she could not for the life of her help rejoicing, though she\r\ndespised herself for it. Isaac Worthington was humbled now, and Jethro\r\nhad humbled him to avenge her. Despite her grief over his return to that\r\nlife, there was something to compel her awe and admiration in the way he\r\nhad risen and done this thing after men had fallen from him. Her mother\r\nhad had something of these same feelings, without knowing why.\r\n\r\nPeople who had nothing but praise for him before were saying hard things\r\nabout Isaac Worthington that night. When the baron is defeated, the serfs\r\ncome out of their holes in the castle rock and fling their curses across\r\nthe moat. Cynthia slept but little, and was glad when the day came to\r\ntake her to her scholars, to ease her mind of the thoughts which tortured\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAnd then, when she stopped at the post-office to speak to Ephraim on her\r\nway homeward in the afternoon, she heard men talking behind the\r\npartition, and she stood, as one stricken, listening beside the window.\r\nOther tidings had come in the shape of a telegram. The first rumor had\r\nbeen false. Brampton had not yet received the details, but the\r\nConsolidation Bill had gone into the House that morning, and would be a\r\nlaw before the week was out. A part of it was incomprehensible to\r\nCynthia, but so much she had understood. She did not wait to speak to\r\nEphraim, and she was going out again when a man rushed past her and\r\nthrough the partition door. Cynthia paused instinctively, for she\r\nrecognized him as one of the frequenters of the station and a bearer of\r\nnews.\r\n\r\n\"Jethro's come home, boys,\" he shouted; \"come in on the four o'clock, and\r\nwent right off to Coniston. Guess he's done for, this time, for certain.\r\nLooks it. By Godfrey, he looks eighty! Callate his day's over, from the\r\nway the boys talked on the train.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia lingered to hear no more, and went out, dazed, into the September\r\nsunshine: Jethro beaten, and broken, and gone to Coniston. Resolution\r\ncame to her as she walked. Arriving home, she wrote a little note and\r\nleft it on the table for Ephraim; and going out again, ran by the back\r\nlane to Mr. Sherman's livery stable behind the Brampton House, and in\r\nhalf an hour was driving along that familiar road to Coniston, alone; for\r\nshe had often driven Jethro's horses, and knew every turn of the way. And\r\nas she gazed at the purple mountain through the haze and drank in the\r\nsweet scents of the year's fulness, she was strangely happy. There was\r\nthe village green in the cool evening light, and the flagstaff with its\r\ntip silvered by the departing sun. She waved to Rias and Lem and Moses at\r\nthe store, but she drove on to the tannery house, and hitched the horse\r\nat the rough granite post, and went in, and through the house, softly, to\r\nthe kitchen.\r\n\r\nJethro was standing in the doorway, and did not turn. He may have thought\r\nshe was Millicent Skinner. Cynthia could see his face. It was older,\r\nindeed, and lined and worn, but that fearful look of desolation which she\r\nhad once surprised upon it, and which she in that instant feared to see,\r\nwas not there. Jethro's soul was at peace, though Cynthia could not\r\nunderstand why it was so. She stole to him and flung her arms about his\r\nneck, and with a cry he seized her and held her against him for I know\r\nnot how long. Had it been possible to have held her there always, he\r\nwould never have let her go. At last he looked down into her tear-wet\r\nface, into her eyes that were shining with tears.\r\n\r\n\"D-done wrong, Cynthy.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia did not answer that, for she remembered how she, too, had exulted\r\nwhen she had believed him to have accomplished Isaac Worthington's\r\ndownfall. Now that he had failed, and she was in his arms, it was not for\r\nher to judge--only to rejoice.\r\n\r\n\"Didn't look for you to come back--didn't expect it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Jethro!\" she faltered. Love for her had made him go, and she would\r\nnot say that, either.\r\n\r\n\"D-don't hate me, Cynthy--don't hate me?\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n\"Love me--a little?\"\r\n\r\nShe reached up her hands and brushed back his hair, tenderly, from his\r\nforehead. Such--a loving gesture was her answer.\r\n\r\n\"You are going to stay here always, now,\" she said, in a low voice, \"you\r\nare never going away again.\"\r\n\r\n\"G-goin' to stay always,\" he answered. Perhaps he was thinking of the\r\nhillside clearing in the forest--who knows! \"You'll come-sometime,\r\nCynthy--sometime?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll come every Saturday and Sunday, Uncle Jethro,\" she said, smiling up\r\nat him. \"Saturday is only two days away, now. I can hardly wait.\"\r\n\r\n\"Y-you'll come sometime?\"\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Jethro, do you think I'll be away from you, except--except when I\r\nhave to?\"\r\n\r\n\"C-come and read to me--won't you--come and read?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I will!\"\r\n\r\n\"C-call to mind the first book you read to me, Cynthy?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was 'Robinson Crusoe,'\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"'R-Robinson Crusoe.' Often thought of that book. Know some of it by\r\nheart. R-read it again, sometime, Cynthy?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked up at him a little anxiously. His eyes were on the great hill\r\nopposite, across Coniston Water.\r\n\r\n\"I will, indeed, Uncle Jethro, if we can find it,\" she answered.\r\n\r\n\"Guess I can find it,\" said Jethro. \"R-remember when you saw him makin' a\r\nship?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Cynthia, \"and I had my feet in the pool.\"\r\n\r\nThe book had made a profound impression upon Jethro, partly because\r\nCynthia had first read it to him, and partly for another reason. The\r\nisolation of Crusoe; depicted by Defoe's genius, had been comparable to\r\nhis own isolation, and he had pondered upon it much of late. Yes, and\r\nupon a certain part of another book which he had read earlier in life:\r\nNapoleon had ended his days on St. Helena.\r\n\r\nThey walked out under the trees to the brook-side and stood listening to\r\nthe tinkling of the cowbells in the wood lot beyond. The light faded\r\nearly on these September evenings, and the smoky mist had begun to rise\r\nfrom the water when they turned back again. The kitchen windows were\r\nalready growing yellow, and through them the faithful Millicent could be\r\nseen bustling about in her preparations for supper. But Cynthia, having\r\naccomplished her errand, would not go in. She could not have borne to\r\nhave any one drive back with her to Brampton then, and she must not be\r\nlate upon the road.\r\n\r\n\"I will come Friday evening, Uncle Jethro,\" she said, as she kissed him\r\nand gave one last, lingering look at his face. Had it been possible, she\r\nwould not have left him, and on her way to Brampton through the gathering\r\ndarkness she mused anxiously upon that strange calmness he had shown\r\nafter defeat.\r\n\r\nShe drove her horse on to the floor of Mr. Sherman's stable, that\r\ngentleman himself gallantly assisting her to alight, and walked homeward\r\nthrough the lane. Ephraim had not yet returned from the postoffice, which\r\ndid not close until eight, and Cynthia smiled when she saw the utensils\r\nof his cooking-kit strewn on the hearth. In her absence he invariably\r\nunpacked and used it, and of course Cynthia at once set herself to\r\ncleaning and packing it again. After that she got her own supper--a very\r\nsimple affair--and was putting the sitting room to rights when Ephraim\r\ncame thumping in.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I swan!\" he exclaimed when he saw her. \"I didn't look for you to\r\ncome back so soon, Cynthy. Put up the kit--hev you?\" He stood in front of\r\nthe fireplace staring with apparent interest at the place where the kit\r\nhad been, and added in a voice which he strove to make quite casual, \"How\r\nbe Jethro?\"\r\n\r\n\"He looks older, Cousin Eph,\" she answered, after a pause, \"and I think\r\nhe is very tired. But he seems he seems more tranquil and contented than\r\nI hoped to find him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to know,\" said Ephraim. \"I am glad to hear it. Glad you went up,\r\nCynthy--you done right to go.\r\n\r\n\"I'd have gone with you, if you'd only told me. I'll git a chance to go\r\nup Sunday.\"\r\n\r\nThere was an air of repressed excitement about the veteran which did not\r\nescape Cynthia. He held two letters in his hand, and, being a postmaster,\r\nhe knew the handwriting on both. One had come from that place in New\r\nJersey, and drew no comment. But the other! That one had been postmarked\r\nat the capital, and as he had sat at his counter at the post-office\r\nwaiting for closing time he bad turned it over and over with many\r\nejaculations and futile guesses. Past master of dissimulation that he\r\nwas, he had made up his mind--if he should find Cynthia at home--to lay\r\nthe letters indifferently on the table and walk into his bedroom. This\r\ncampaign he now proceeded to carry out.\r\n\r\nCynthia smiled again when he was gone, and shook her head and picked up\r\nthe letters: Bob's was uppermost and she read that first, without a\r\nthought of the other one. And she smiled as she read for Bob had had a\r\npromotion. He was not yet at the head of the locomotive works, he\r\nhastened to add, for fear that Cynthia might think that Mr. Broke had\r\nresigned the presidency in his favor; and Cynthia never failed to laugh\r\nat these little facetious asides. He was now earning the princely sum of\r\nninety dollars a month--not enough to marry on, alas! On Saturday nights\r\nhe and Percy Broke scrubbed as much as possible of the grime from their\r\nhands and faces and went to spend Sunday at Elberon, the Broke place on\r\nthe Hudson; from whence Miss Sally Broke, if she happened to be at home,\r\nalways sent Cynthia her love. As Cynthia is still a heroine, I shall not\r\ndescribe how she felt about Sally Broke's love. There was plenty of Bob's\r\nown in the letter. Cynthia would got have blamed him if he bad fallen in\r\nlove with Miss Broke. It seemed to her little short of miraculous that,\r\namidst such surroundings, he could be true to her.\r\n\r\nAfter a period which was no briefer than that usually occupied by Bob's\r\nletters, Cynthia took the other one from her lap, and stared at it in\r\nmuch perplexity before she tore it open. We have seen its contents over\r\nMr. Worthington's shoulder, and our hearts will not stop beating--as\r\nCynthia's did. She read it twice before the full meaning of it came to\r\nher, and after that she could not well mistake it,--the language being so\r\nadmirable in every way. She sat very still for a long while, and\r\npresently she heard Ephraim go out. But Cynthia did not move. Mr.\r\nWorthington relented and Bob recalled! The vista of happiness suddenly\r\nopened up, widened and widened until it was too bright for Cynthia's\r\nvision, and she would compel her mind to dwell on another prospect,--that\r\nof the father and son reconciled. Although her temples throbbed, she\r\ntried to analyze the letter. It implied that Mr. Worthington had allowed\r\nBob to remain away on a sort of probation; it implied that it had been\r\ndictated by a strong paternal love mingled with a strong paternal\r\njustice. And then there was the appeal to her: \"You will look with\r\nindulgence upon any acts of mine which sprang from a natural solicitation\r\nfor the welfare and happiness of my only child.\" A terrible insight is\r\ntheirs to whom it is given to love as Cynthia loved.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there came a knock which frightened her, for her mind was\r\nrunning on swiftly from point to point: had, indeed, flown as far as\r\nConiston by now, and she was thinking of that strange look of peace on\r\nJethro's face which had troubled her. One letter she thrust into her\r\ndress, but the other she laid aside, and her knees trembled under her as\r\nshe rose and went into the entry and raised the latch and opened the\r\ndoor. There was a moon, and the figure in the frock coat and the silk hat\r\nwas the one which she expected to see. The silk hat came off very\r\npromptly.\r\n\r\n\"I hope I am not disturbing you, Miss Wetherell,\" said the owner of it.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered Cynthia, faintly.\r\n\r\n\"May I come in?\"\r\n\r\nCynthia held open the door a little wider, and Mr. Worthington walked in.\r\nHe seemed very majestic and out of place in the little house which\r\nGabriel Post had built, and he carried into it some of the atmosphere of\r\nthe walnut and high ceilings of his own mansion. His manner of laying his\r\nhat, bottom up, on the table, and of unbuttoning his coat, subtly\r\nindicated the honor which he was conferring upon the place. And he eyed\r\nCynthia, standing before him in the lamplight, with a modification of the\r\nhawk-like look which was meant to be at once condescending and\r\nconciliatory. He did not imprint a kiss upon her brow, as some\r\nprospective fathers-in-law would have done. But his eyes, perhaps\r\ninvoluntarily, paid a tribute to her personal appearance which heightened\r\nher color. She might not, after all, be such a discredit to the\r\nWorthington family.\r\n\r\n\"Won't you sit down?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Cynthia,\" he said; \"I hope I may now be allowed to call you\r\nCynthia?\"\r\n\r\nShe did not answer him, but sat down herself, and he followed her\r\nexample; with his eyes still upon her.\r\n\r\n\"You have doubtless received my letter,\" began Mr. Worthington. \"I only\r\narrived in Brampton an hour ago, but I thought it best to come to you at\r\nonce, under the circumstances.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Cynthia, \"I received the letter.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad,\" said Mr. Worthington. He was beginning to be a little taken\r\naback by her calmness and her apparent absence of joy. It was scarcely\r\nthe way in which a school-teacher should receive the advances of the\r\nfirst citizen, come to give a gracious consent to her marriage with his\r\nson. Had he known it, Cynthia was anything but calm. \"I am glad,\" he\r\nsaid, \"because I took pains to explain the exact situation in that\r\nletter, and to set forth my own sentiments. I hope you understood them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I understood them,\" said Cynthia, in a low tone.\r\n\r\nThis was enigmatical, to say the least. But Mr. Worthington had come with\r\nsuch praiseworthy intentions that he was disposed to believe that the\r\ngirl was overwhelmed by the good fortune which had suddenly overtaken\r\nher. He was therefore disposed to be a little conciliatory.\r\n\r\n\"My conduct may have appeared harsh to you,\" he continued. \"I will not\r\ndeny that I opposed the matter at first. Robert was still in college, and\r\nhe has a generous, impressionable nature which he inherits from his poor\r\nmother--the kind of nature likely to commit a rash act which would ruin\r\nhis career. I have since become convinced that he has--ahem--inherited\r\nlikewise a determination of purpose and an ability to get on in the world\r\nwhich I confess I had underestimated. My friend, Mr. Broke, has written\r\nme a letter about him, and tells me that he has already promoted him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\"You hear from him?\" inquired Mr. Worthington, giving her a quick glance.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Cynthia, her color rising a little.\r\n\r\n\"And yet,\" said Mr. Worthington, slowly, \"I have been under the\r\nimpression that you have persistently refused to marry him.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true,\" she answered.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot refrain from complimenting you, Cynthia, upon such rare\r\nconduct,\" said he. \"You will be glad to know that it has contributed more\r\nthan anything else toward my estimation of your character, and has\r\nstrengthened me in my resolution that I am now doing right. It may be\r\ndifficult for you to understand a father's feelings. The complete\r\nseparation from my only son was telling on me severely, and I could not\r\nforget that you were the cause of that separation. I knew nothing about\r\nyou, except--\" He hesitated, for she had turned to him.\r\n\r\n\"Except what?\" she asked.\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington coughed. Mr. Flint had told him, that very morning, of\r\nher separation from Jethro, and of the reasons which people believed had\r\ncaused it. Unfortunately, we have not time to go into that conversation\r\nwith Mr. Flint, who had given a very good account of Cynthia indeed.\r\nAfter all (Mr. Worthington reflected), he had consented to the marriage,\r\nand there was no use in bringing Jethro's name into the conversation.\r\nJethro would be forgotten soon.\r\n\r\n\"I will not deny to You that I had other plans for my son,\" he said. \"I\r\nhad hoped that he would marry a daughter of a friend of mine. You must be\r\na little indulgent with parents, Cynthia,\" he added with a little smile,\r\n\"we have our castles in the air, too. Sometimes, as in this case, by a\r\nwise provision of providence they go astray. I suppose you have heard of\r\nMiss Duncan's marriage.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\"She ran off with a worthless Italian nobleman. I believe, on the whole,\"\r\nhe said, with what was an extreme complaisance for the first citizen,\r\n\"that I have reason to congratulate myself upon Robert's choice. I have\r\nmade inquiries about you, and I find that I have had the pleasure of\r\nknowing your mother, whom I respected very much. And your father, I\r\nunderstand, came of very good people, and was forced by circumstances to\r\nadopt the means of livelihood he did. My attention has been called to the\r\nletters he wrote to the Guardian, which I hear have been highly praised\r\nby competent critics, and I have ordered a set of them for the files of\r\nthe library. You yourself, I find, are highly thought of in Brampton\" (a,\r\nnot unimportant factor, by the way); \"you have been splendidly educated,\r\nand are a lady. In short, Cynthia, I have come to give my formal consent\r\nto your engagement to my son Robert.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I am not engaged to him,\" said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\"He will be here shortly, I imagine,\" said Mr. Worthington.\r\n\r\nCynthia was trembling more than ever by this time. She was very angry,\r\nand she had found it very difficult to repress the things which she had\r\nbeen impelled to speak. She did not hate Isaac Worthington now--she\r\ndespised him. He had not dared to mention Jethro, who had been her\r\nbenefactor, though he had done his best to have her removed from the\r\nschool because of her connection with Jethro.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Worthington,\" she said, \"I have not yet made up my mind whether I\r\nshall marry your son.\"\r\n\r\nTo say that Mr. Worthington's breath was taken away when he heard these\r\nwords would be to use a mild expression. He doubted his senses.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" he exclaimed, starting forward, \"what do you mean?\"\r\n\r\nCynthia hesitated a moment. She was not frightened, but she was trying to\r\nchoose her words without passion.\r\n\r\n\"I refused to marry him,\" she said, \"because you withheld your consent,\r\nand I did not wish to be the cause of a quarrel between you. It was not\r\ndifficult to guess your feelings toward me, even before certain things\r\noccurred of which I will not speak. I did my best, from the very first,\r\nto make Bob give up the thought of marrying me, although I loved and\r\nhonored him. Loving him as I do, I do not want to be the cause of\r\nseparating him from his father, and of depriving him of that which is\r\nrightfully his. But something was due to myself. If I should ever make up\r\nmy mind to marry him,\" continued Cynthia, looking at Mr. Worthington\r\nsteadfastly, \"it will not be because your consent is given or withheld.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you tell me this to my face?\" exclaimed Mr. Worthington, now in a\r\nrage himself at such unheard-of presumption.\r\n\r\n\"To your face,\" said Cynthia, who got more self-controlled as he grew\r\nangry. \"I believe that that consent, which you say you have given freely,\r\nwas wrung from you.\"\r\n\r\nIt was unfortunate that the first citizen might not always have Mr. Flint\r\nby him to restrain and caution him. But Mr. Flint could have no command\r\nover his master's sensations, and anger and apprehension goaded Mr.\r\nWorthington to indiscretion.\r\n\r\n\"Jethro Bass told you this!\" he cried out.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Cynthia answered, not in the least surprised by the admission, \"he\r\ndid not tell me--but he will if I ask him. I guessed it from your letter.\r\nI heard that he had come back to-day, and I went to Coniston to see him,\r\nand he told me--he had been defeated.\"\r\n\r\nTears came into her eyes at the remembrance of the scene in the tannery\r\nhouse that afternoon, and she knew now why Jethro's face had worn that\r\nlook of peace. He had made his supreme sacrifice--for her. No, he had\r\ntold her nothing, and she might never have known. She sat thinking of the\r\nmagnitude of this thing Jethro had done, and she ceased to speak, and the\r\ntears coursed down her cheeks unheeded.\r\n\r\nIsaac Worthington had a habit of clutching things when he was in a rage,\r\nand now he clutched the arms of the chair. He had grown white. He was\r\nfurious with her, furious with himself for having spoken that which might\r\nbe construed into a confession. He had not finished writing the letters\r\nbefore he had stood self-justified, and he had been self-justified ever\r\nsince. Where now were these arguments so wonderfully plausible? Where\r\nwere the refutations which he had made ready in case of a barely possible\r\nneed? He had gone into the Pelican House intending to tell Jethro of his\r\ndetermination to agree to the marriage. That was one. He had done\r\nso--that was another--and he had written the letters that Jethro might be\r\nconvinced of his good will. There were still more, involving Jethro's\r\ncharacter for veracity and other things. Summoning these, he waited for\r\nCynthia to have done speaking, but when she had finished--he said\r\nnothing. He looked a her, and saw the tears on her face, and he saw that\r\nshe had completely forgotten his presence.\r\n\r\nFor the life of him, Isaac Worthington could not utter a word. He was a\r\nman, as we know, who did not talk idly, and he knew that Cynthia would\r\nnot hear what he said; and arguments and denunciations lose their effect\r\nwhen repeated. Again, he knew that she would not believe him. Never in\r\nhis life had Isaac Worthington been so ignored, so put to shame, as by\r\nthis school-teacher of Brampton. Before, self-esteem and sophistry had\r\nalways carried him off between them; sometimes, in truth, with a\r\nwound--the wound had always healed. But he had a feeling, to-night, that\r\nthis woman had glanced into his soul, and had turned away from it. As he\r\nlooked at her the texture of his anger changed; he forgot for the first\r\ntime that which he had been pleased to think of as her position in life,\r\nand he feared her. He had matched his spirit against hers.\r\n\r\nBefore long the situation became intolerable to him, for Cynthia still\r\nsat silent. She was thinking of how she had blamed Jethro for going back\r\nto that life, even though his love for her had made him do it. But Isaac\r\nWorthington did not know of what she was thinking--he thought only of\r\nhimself and his predicament. He could not remain, and yet he could not\r\ngo--with dignity. He who had come to bestow could not depart like a\r\nwhipped dog.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a fear transfixed him: suppose that this woman, from whom he\r\ncould not hide the truth, should tell his son what he had done. Bob would\r\nbelieve her. Could he, Isaac Worthington, humble his pride and ask her to\r\nkeep her suspicions to herself? He would then be acknowledging that they\r\nwere more than suspicions. If he did so, he would have to appear to\r\nforgive her in spite of what she had said to him. And Bob was coming\r\nhome. Could he tell Bob that he had changed his mind and withdrawn his\r\nconsent to the marriage? There world be the reason, and again Bob would\r\nbelieve her. And again, if he withdrew his consent, there was Jethro to\r\nreckon with. Jethro must have a weapon still, Mr. Worthington thought,\r\nalthough he could not imagine what it might be. As Isaac Worthington sat\r\nthere, thinking, it grew clear, to him at last that there was but one\r\nexit out of a, very desperate situation.\r\n\r\nHe glanced at Cynthia again, this time appraisingly. She had dried her\r\neyes, but she made no effort to speak. After all, she would make such a\r\nwife for his son as few men possessed. He thought of Sarah Hollingsworth.\r\nShe had been a good woman, but there had been many times when he had\r\ndeplored--especially in his travels the lack of other qualities in his\r\nwife. Cynthia, he thought, had these qualities,--so necessary for the\r\nwife of one who would succeed to power--though whence she had got them\r\nIsaac Worthington could not imagine. She would become a personage; she\r\nwas a woman of whom they had no need to be ashamed at home or abroad.\r\nHaving completed these reflections, he broke the silence.\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry that you should have been misled into thinking such a thing\r\nas you have expressed, Cynthia,\" he said, \"but I believe that I can\r\nunderstand something of the feelings which prompted you. It is natural\r\nthat you should have a resentment against me after everything that has\r\nhappened. It is perhaps natural, too, that I should lose my temper under\r\nthe circumstances. Let us forget it. And I trust that in the future we\r\nshall grow into the mutual respect and affection which our nearer\r\nrelationship will demand.\"\r\n\r\nHe rose, and took up his hat, and Cynthia rose too. There was something\r\nvery fine, he thought, about her carriage and expression as she stood in\r\nfront of him.\r\n\r\n\"There is my hand,\" he said,--\"will you take it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will take it,\" Cynthia answered, \"because you are Bob's father.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then Mr. Worthington went away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nI am able to cite one notable instance, at least, to disprove the saying\r\na part of which is written above, and I have yet to hear of a case in\r\nwhich a gentleman ever hesitated a single instant on account of the first\r\nletter of a lady's last name. I know, indeed, of an occasion when\r\nlocomotives could not go fast enough, when thirty miles an hour seemed a\r\nsnail's pace to a young main who sat by the open window of a train that\r\ncrept northward on a certain hazy September morning up the beautiful\r\nvalley of a broad river which we know.\r\n\r\nIt was after three o'clock before he caught sight of the familiar crest\r\nof Farewell Mountain, and the train ran into Harwich. How glad he was to\r\nsee everybody there, whether he knew them or not! He came near hugging\r\nthe conductor of the Truro accommodation; who, needless to say, did not\r\nask him for a ticket, or even a pass. And then the young man went forward\r\nand almost shook the arms off of the engineer and the fireman, and\r\nclimbed into the cab, and actually drove the engine himself as far as\r\nBrampton, where it arrived somewhat ahead of schedule, having taken some\r\nof the curves and bridges at a speed a little beyond the law. The\r\nengineer was richer by five dollars, and the son of a railroad president\r\nis a privileged character, anyway.\r\n\r\nYes, here was Brampton, and in spite of the haze the sun had never shone\r\nso brightly on the terraced steeple of the meeting-house. He leaped out\r\nof the cab almost before the engine had stopped, and beamed upon\r\neverybody on the platform,--even upon Mr. Dodd, who chanced to be there.\r\nIn a twinkling the young man is in Mr. Sherman's hack, and Mr. Sherman\r\ngalloping his horse down Brampton Street, the young man with his head out\r\nof the window, smiling; grinning would be a better word. Here are the\r\niron mastiffs, and they seem to be grinning, too. The young man flings\r\nopen the carriage door and leaps out, and the door is almost broken from\r\nits hinges by the maple tree. He rushes up the steps and through the\r\nhall, and into the library, where the first citizen and his seneschal are\r\nsitting.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Father, you see I didn't waste any time,\" he cried; grasping his\r\nfather's hand in a grip that made Mr. Worthington wince. \"Well, you are a\r\ntrump, after all. We're both a little hot-headed, I guess, and do things\r\nwe're sorry for,--but that's all over now, isn't it? I'm sorry. I might\r\nhave known you'd come round when you found out for yourself what kind of\r\na girl Cynthia was. Did you ever see anybody like her?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Flint turned his back, and started to walk out of the room.\r\n\r\n\"Don't go, Flint, old boy,\" Bob called out, seizing Mr. Flint's hand,\r\ntoo. \"I can't stay but a minute, now. How are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, Bob,\" answered Mr. Flint, with a curious, kindly look in his\r\neyes that was not often there. \"I'm glad to see you home. I have to go to\r\nthe bank.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Father,\" said Bob, \"school must be out, and I imagine you know\r\nwhere I'm going. I just thought I'd stop in to--to thank you, and get a\r\nbenediction.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am very happy to have you back, Robert,\" replied Mr. Worthington, and\r\nit was true. It would have been strange indeed if some tremor of\r\nsentiment had not been in his voice and some gleam of pride in his eye as\r\nhe looked upon his son.\r\n\r\n\"So you saw her, and couldn't resist her,\" said Bob. \"Wasn't that how it\r\nhappened?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington sat down again at the desk, and his hand began to stray\r\namong the papers. He was thinking of Mr. Flint's exit.\r\n\r\n\"I do not arrive at my decisions quite in that way, Robert,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"But you have seen her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I have seen her.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a hesitation, an uneasiness in his father's tone for which Bob\r\ncould not account, and which he attributed to emotion. He did not guess\r\nthat this hour of supreme joy could hold for Isaac Worthington another\r\nsensation.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't she the finest girl in the world?\" he demanded. \"How does she\r\nseem? How does she look?\"\r\n\r\n\"She looks extremely well,\" said Mr. Worthington, who had now schooled\r\nhis voice. \"In fact, I am quite ready to admit that Cynthia Wetherell\r\npossesses the qualifications necessary for your wife. If she had not, I\r\nshould never have written you.\"\r\n\r\nBob walked to the window.\r\n\r\n\"Father;\" he said, speaking with a little difficulty, \"I can't tell you\r\nhow much I appreciate your--your coming round. I wanted to do the right\r\nthing, but I just couldn't give up such a girl as that.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall let bygones be bygones, Robert,\" answered Mr. Worthington,\r\nclearing his throat.\r\n\r\n\"She never would have me without your consent. By the way,\" he cried,\r\nturning suddenly, \"did she say she'd have me now?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe,\" said Mr. Worthington, clearing his throat again, \"I believe\r\nshe reserved her decision.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must be off,\" said Bob, \"she goes to Coniston on Fridays. I'll drive\r\nher out. Good-by, Father.\"\r\n\r\nHe flew out of the room, ran into Mrs. Holden, whom he astonished by\r\nsaluting on the cheek, and astonished even more by asking her to tell\r\nSilas to drive his black horses to Gabriel Post's house--as the cottage\r\nwas still known in Brampton. And having hastily removed some of the\r\ncinders, he flew out of the door and reached the park-like space in the\r\nmiddle of Brampton Street. Then he tried to walk decorously, but it was\r\nhard work. What if she should not be in?\r\n\r\nThe door and windows of the little house were open that balmy afternoon,\r\nand the bees were buzzing among the flowers which Cynthia had planted on\r\neither side of the step. Bob went up the path, and caught a glimpse of\r\nher through the entry standing in the sitting room. She was, indeed,\r\nwaiting for the Coniston stage, and she did not see him. Shall I destroy\r\nthe mental image of the reader who has known her so long by trying to\r\ntell what she looked like? Some heroines grow thin and worn by the\r\ntroubles which they are forced to go through. Cynthia was not this kind\r\nof a heroine. She was neither tall nor short, and the dark blue gown\r\nwhich she wore set off (so Bob thought) the curves of her figure to\r\nperfection. Her face had become a little more grave--yes, and more noble;\r\nand the eyes and mouth had an indescribable, womanly sweetness.\r\n\r\nHe stood for a moment outside the doorway gazing at her; hesitating to\r\ndesecrate that revery, which seemed to him to have a touch of sadness in\r\nit. And then she turned her head, slowly, and saw him, and her lips\r\nparted, and a startled look came into her eyes, but she did not move. He\r\ncame quickly into the room and stopped again, quivering from head to foot\r\nwith the passion which the sight of her never failed to unloose within\r\nhim. Still she did not speak, but her lip trembled, and the love leaping\r\nin his eyes kindled a yearning in hers,--a yearning she was powerless to\r\nresist. He may by that strange power have drawn her toward him--he never\r\nknew. Neither of them could have given evidence on that marvellous\r\ninstant when the current bridged the space between them. He could not say\r\nwhether this woman whom he had seized by force before had shown alike\r\nvitality in her surrender. He only knew that her arms were woven about\r\nhis neck, and that the kiss of which he had dreamed was again on his\r\nlips, and that he felt once more her wonderful, supple body pressed\r\nagainst his, and her heart beating, and her breast heaving. And he knew\r\nthat the strength of the love in her which he had gained was beyond\r\nestimation.\r\n\r\nThus for a time they swung together in ethereal space, breathless with\r\nthe motion of their flight. The duration of such moments is--in\r\nwords--limitless. Now he held her against him, and again he held her away\r\nthat his eyes might feast upon hers until she dropped her lashes and the\r\ncrimson tide flooded into her face and she hid it again in the refuge she\r\nhad longed for,--murmuring his name. But at last, startled by some sound\r\nwithout and so brought back to earth, she led him gently to the window at\r\nthe side and looked up at him searchingly. He was tanned no longer.\r\n\r\n\"I was afraid you had been working too hard,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"So you do love me?\" was Bob's answer to this remark.\r\n\r\nCynthia smiled at him with her eyes: gravely, if such a thing may be said\r\nof a smile.\r\n\r\n\"Bob, how can you ask?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Cynthia,\" he cried, \"if you knew what I have been through, you\r\nwouldn't have held out, I know it. I began to think I should never have\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you have me now,\" she said, and was silent.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you look like that?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nShe smiled up at him again.\r\n\r\n\"I, too, have suffered, Bob,\" she said. \"And I have thought of you night\r\nand day.\"\r\n\r\n\"God bless you, sweetheart,\" he cried, and kissed her again,--many times.\r\n\"It's all right now, isn't it? I knew my father would give his consent\r\nwhen he found out what you were.\"\r\n\r\nThe expression of pain which had troubled him crossed her face again, and\r\nshe put her hand on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, dearest,\" she said, \"I love you. I am doing this for you. You\r\nmust understand that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes, Cynthia, I understand it--of course I do,\" he answered,\r\nperplexed. \"I understand it, but I don't deserve it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want you to know,\" she continued in a low voice, \"that I should have\r\nmarried you anyway. I--I could not have helped it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cynthia!\"\r\n\r\n\"If you were to go back to the locomotive works' tomorrow, I would marry\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"On ninety dollars a month?\" exclaimed Bob.\r\n\r\n\"If you wanted me,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Wanted you! I could live in a log cabin with you the rest of my life.\"\r\n\r\nShe drew down his face to hers, and kissed him.\r\n\r\n\"But I wished you to be reconciled with your father,\" she said; \"I could\r\nnot bear to come between you. You--you are reconciled, aren't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, we are,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad, Bob,\" she answered simply. \"I should not have been happy if I\r\nhad driven you away from the place where you should be, which is your\r\nhome.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wherever you are will be my home; sweetheart,\" he said, and pressed her\r\nto him once more.\r\n\r\nAt length, looking past his shoulder into the street, she saw Lem\r\nHallowell pulling up the Brampton stage before the door.\r\n\r\n\"Bob,\" she said, \"I must go to Coniston and see Uncle Jethro. I promised\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nBob's answer was to walk into the entry, where he stood waving the most\r\njoyous of greetings at the surprised stage driver.\r\n\r\n\"I guess you won't get anybody here, Lem,\" he called out.\r\n\r\n\"But, Bob,\" protested Cynthia, from within, afraid to show her face just\r\nthen, \"I have to go, I promised. And--and I want to go,\" she added when\r\nhe turned.\r\n\r\n\"I'm running a stage to Coniston to-day myself, Lem,\" said he \"and I'm\r\ngoing to steal your best passenger.\"\r\n\r\nLemuel immediately flung down his reins and jumped out of the stage and\r\ncame up the path and into the entry, where he stood confronting Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\"Hev you took him, Cynthy?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Lem,\" she answered, \"won't you congratulate me?\"\r\n\r\nThe warm-hearted stage driver did congratulate her in a most unmistakable\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\"I think a sight of her, Bob,\" he said after he had shaken both of Bob's\r\nhands and brushed his own eyes with his coat sleeve. \"I've knowed her so\r\nlong--\" Whereupon utterance failed him, and he ran down the path and\r\njumped into his stage again and drove off.\r\n\r\nAnd then Cynthia sent Bob on an errand--not a very long one, and while he\r\nwas gone, she sat down at the table and tried to realize her happiness,\r\nand failed. In less than ten minutes Bob had come back with Cousin\r\nEphraim, as fast as he could hobble. He flung his arms around her, stick\r\nand all, and he was crying. It is a fact that old soldiers sometimes cry.\r\nBut his tears did not choke his utterance.\r\n\r\n\"Great Tecumseh!\" said Cousin Ephraim, \"so you've went and done it,\r\nCynthy. Siege got a little mite too hot. I callated she'd capitulate in\r\nthe end, but she held out uncommon long.\"\r\n\r\n\"That she did,\" exclaimed Bob, feelingly.\r\n\r\n\"I--I was tellin' Bob I hain't got nothin' against him,\" continued\r\nEphraim.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Cousin Eph,\" said Cynthia, laughing in spite of herself, and\r\nglancing at Bob, \"is that all you can say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Cousin Eph's all right,\" said Bob, laughing too. \"We understand each\r\nother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Callate we do,\" answered Ephraim. \"I'll go so far as to say there hain't\r\nnobody I'd ruther see you marry. Guess I'll hev to go back to the kit,\r\nnow. What's to become of the old pensioner, Cynthy?\"\r\n\r\n\"The old pensioner needn't worry,\" said Cynthia.\r\n\r\nThen drove up Silas the Silent, with Bob's buggy and his black trotters.\r\nAll of Brampton might see them now; and all of Brampton did see them.\r\nSilas got out,--his presence not being required,--and Cynthia was helped\r\nin, and Bob got in beside her, and away they went, leaving Ephraim waving\r\nhis stick after them from the doorstep.\r\n\r\nIt is recorded against the black trotters that they made very poor time\r\nto Coniston that day, though I cannot discover that either of them was\r\nlame. Lem Hallowell, who was there nearly an hour ahead of them, declares\r\nthat the off horse had a bunch of branches in his mouth. Perhaps Bob held\r\nthem in on account of the scenery that September afternoon. Incomparable\r\nscenery! I doubt if two lovers of the renaissance ever wandered through a\r\nmore wondrous realm of pleasance--to quote the words of the poet. Spots\r\nin it are like a park, laid out by that peerless landscape gardener,\r\nnature: dark, symmetrical pine trees on the sward, and maples in the\r\nfulness of their leaf, and great oaks on the hillsides, and, coppices;\r\nand beyond, the mountain, the evergreens massed like cloud-shadows on its\r\nslopes; and all-trees and coppice and mountain--flattened by the haze\r\nuntil they seemed woven in the softest of blues and blue greens into one\r\nexquisite picture of an ancient tapestry. I, myself, have seen these\r\npictures in that country, and marvelled.\r\n\r\nSo they drove on through that realm, which was to be their realm, and\r\ncame all too soon to Coniston green. Lem Hallowell had spread the\r\nwell-nigh incredible news, that Cynthia Wetherell was to marry the son of\r\nthe mill-owner and railroad president of Brampton, and it seemed to\r\nCynthia that every man and woman and child of the village was gathered at\r\nthe store. Although she loved them, every one, she whispered something to\r\nBob when she caught sight of that group on the platform, and he spoke to\r\nthe trotters. Thus it happened that they flew by, and were at the tannery\r\nhouse before they knew it; and Cynthia, all unaided, sprang out of the\r\nbuggy and ran in, alone. She found Jethro sitting outside of the kitchen\r\ndoor with a volume on his knee, and she saw that the print of it was\r\nlarge, and she knew that the book was \"Robinson Crusoe.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia knelt down on the grass beside him and caught his hands in hers.\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Jethro,\" she said, \"I am going to marry Bob Worthington.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Cynthy,\" he answered. And taking the initiative for the first time\r\nin his life, he stooped down and kissed her.\r\n\r\n\"I knew--you would be happy--in my happiness,\" she said, the tears\r\nbrimming in her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"N-never have been so happy, Cynthy,--never have.\"\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Jethro, I never will desert you. I shall always take care of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"R-read to me sometimes, Cynthy--r-read to me?\"\r\n\r\nBut she could not answer him. She was sobbing on the pages of that book\r\nhe had given her--long ago.\r\n\r\nI like to dwell on happiness, and I am reluctant to leave these people\r\nwhom I have grown to love. Jethro Bass lived to take Cynthia's children\r\ndown by the brook and to show them the pictures, at least, in that\r\nwonderful edition of \"Robinson Crusoe.\" He would never depart from the\r\ntannery house, but Cynthia went to him there, many times a week. There is\r\na spot not far from the Coniston road, and five miles distant alike from\r\nBrampton and Coniston, where Bob Worthington built his house, and where\r\nhe and Cynthia dwelt many years; and they go there to this day, in the\r\nsummer-time. It stands in the midst of broad lands, and the ground in\r\nfront of it slopes down to Coniston Water, artificially widened here by a\r\nstone dam into a little lake. From the balcony of the summer-house which\r\noverhangs the lake there is a wonderful view of Coniston Mountain, and\r\nCynthia Worthington often sits there with her sewing or her book,\r\nlistening to the laughter of her children, and thinking, sometimes, of\r\nbygone days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTERWORD\r\n\r\nThe reality of the foregoing pages has to the author, at least, become so\r\nvivid that he regrets the necessity of having to add an afterword. Every\r\nnovel is, to some extent, a compound of truth and fiction, and he has\r\ndone his best to picture conditions as they were, and to make the spirit\r\nof his book true. Certain people who were living in St. Louis during the\r\nCivil War have been mentioned as the originals of characters in \"The\r\nCrisis,\" and there are houses in that city which have been pointed out as\r\nfitting descriptions in that novel. An author has, frequently, people,\r\nhouses, and localities in mind when he writes; but he changes them,\r\nsometimes very materially, in the process of literary construction.\r\n\r\nIt is inevitable, perhaps, that many people of a certain New England\r\nstate will recognize Jethro Bass. There are different opinions extant\r\nconcerning the remarkable original of this character; ardent defenders\r\nand detractors of his are still living, but all agree that he was a\r\nstrange man of great power. The author disclaims any intention of writing\r\na biography of him. Some of the things set down in this book he did, and\r\nothers he did not do. Some of the anecdotes here related concerning him\r\nare, in the main, true, and for this material the author acknowledges his\r\nindebtedness particularly to Colonel Thomas B. Cheney of Ashland, New\r\nHampshire, and to other friends who have helped him. Jethro Bass was\r\ntypical of his Era, and it is of the Era that this book attempts to\r\ntreat.\r\n\r\nConcerning the locality where Jethro Bass was born and lived, it will and\r\nwill not be recognized. It would have been the extreme of bad taste to\r\nhave put into these pages any portraits which might have offended\r\nfamilies or individuals, and in order that it may be known that the\r\nauthor has not done so he has written this Afterword. Nor has he\r\nparticularly chosen for the field of this novel a state of which he is a\r\ncitizen, and for which he has a sincere affection. The conditions here\r\ndepicted, while retaining the characteristics of the locality, he\r\nbelieves to be typical of the Era over a large part of the United States.\r\n\r\nMany of the Puritans who came to New England were impelled to emigrate\r\nfrom the old country, no doubt, by an aversion to pulling the forelock as\r\nwell as by religious principles, and the spirit of these men prevailed\r\nfor a certain time after the Revolution was fought. Such men lived and\r\nruled in Coniston before the rise of Jethro Bass.\r\n\r\nSelf-examination is necessary for the moral health of nations as well as\r\nmen, and it is the most hopeful of signs that in the United States we are\r\nto-day going through a period of self-examination.\r\n\r\nWe shall do well to ascertain the causes which have led us gradually to\r\nstray from the political principles laid down by our forefathers for all\r\nthe world to see. Some of us do not even know what those principles were.\r\nI have met many intelligent men, in different states of the Union, who\r\ncould not even repeat the names of the senators who sat for them in\r\nCongress. Macaulay said, in 1852, \"We now know, by the clearest of all\r\nproof, that universal suffrage, even united with secret voting, is no\r\nsecurity, against the establishment of arbitrary power.\" To quote James\r\nRussell Lowell, writing a little later: \"We have begun obscurely to\r\nrecognize that . . . popular government is not in itself a panacea, is no\r\nbetter than any other form except as the virtue and wisdom of the people\r\nmake it so.\"\r\n\r\nAs Americans, we cannot but believe that our political creed goes down in\r\nits foundations to the solid rock of truth. One of the best reasons for\r\nour belief lies in the fact that, since 1776, government after government\r\nhas imitated our example. We have, by our very existence and rise to\r\npower, made any decided retrogression from these doctrines impossible. So\r\nmany people have tried to rule themselves, and are still trying, that one\r\nbegins to believe that the time is not far distant when the United\r\nStates, once the most radical, will become the most conservative of\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nThus the duty rests to-day, more heavily than ever, upon each American\r\ncitizen to make good to the world those principles upon which his\r\ngovernment was built. To use a figure suggested by the calamity which has\r\nlately befallen one of the most beloved of our cities, there is a theory\r\nthat earthquakes are caused by a necessary movement on the part of the\r\nglobe to regain its axis. Whether or not the theory be true, it has its\r\npolitical application. In America to-day we are trying--whatever the\r\ncost--to regain the true axis established for us by the founders of our\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\nHARLAKENDEN HOUSE, May 7, 1906.",
