NO. 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_WEALTH AND ITS CONSEQUENCES._\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the government established by our forefathers became a recognized\r\nfact both at home and abroad, and for three-quarters of a century\r\nthereafter, no one dreamed that the greatest danger which threatened\r\nits existence was the wealth which might accumulate within its realm;\r\nindeed, no one ever dreamed of the possibilities which lay in that\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nIt is only during the past twenty years that the accumulation of\r\nwealth has entered into the problem. Down to the period of 1861, the\r\nonly disturbing element of any magnitude was slavery. It was the\r\nslavery problem which weighed so heavily upon the \"godlike\" Webster.\r\nIt was an ever-present, ghastly, and hideous form, appealing to his\r\npatriotic soul. It is certain that it cast a shadow of melancholy over\r\nhis whole life. But Mr. Webster did not live to witness the dreadful\r\nloss of life and treasure, and the awful gloom, of its going out.\r\n\r\nThere is a question now of far greater magnitude than that which was\r\nsettled by the sword, and that is the question of the enormous wealth,\r\nand its increase in the hands of the few. No reference is now made to\r\nthe owners of the thousands or the hundreds of thousands--to the\r\nindustrious and prosperous people scattered all over the land; for\r\nmoderate wealth, universally diffused, is the prime safeguard of a\r\nnation: but I refer to the millions, the tens of millions, and the\r\nhundreds of millions owned and controlled by the few.\r\n\r\nThe ignorant poor and the no less ignorant rich may ridicule or sneer\r\nat the expression of fear that harm may come to the Republic on\r\naccount of great wealth; but ridicule never settled any question.\r\nRidicule is always the weapon of the ignorant and the vicious. None\r\nbut the ignorant will ridicule the subject, for the history of the\r\nworld reveals the destruction of nations on account of wealth--never\r\nfrom poverty.\r\n\r\nWhat if a man does have millions--is it any of the people's business?\r\nis the query of the ignorant. This is the question that is to be\r\nsolved. This is, in fact, the supreme question. If the government is a\r\ngovernment of the people and for the people, under the people's\r\nConstitution the people have the right to protect themselves. If the\r\npossession of millions by any person is a menace to the liberties of\r\nthe people and to the permanence of their government, the people have\r\nthe right to legislate upon the matter and to protect themselves. That\r\nthis Republic belongs to the people, no one can doubt. That it was\r\nestablished, by their blood and treasure, as an asylum for the\r\noppressed of all nations and the perpetual abode of free men, every\r\npage of American history attests. The protest of our forefathers to\r\nBritish tyranny, the Declaration of Independence, the war which\r\nfollowed, the steps taken for the adoption of a Constitution, the Bill\r\nof Rights, and the Constitution all declare, in terms not to be\r\nmistaken, the right of the people to protection against foes from\r\nwithin and foes from without. How this menace will be met I have no\r\nmeans of knowing; but that it must be met, or sooner or later the\r\nRepublic will be destroyed, no intelligent man can doubt.\r\n\r\nAs matters now stand, bad as they are, it might perhaps be endurable;\r\nbut wealth accumulates, and the man with ten millions to-day may have\r\na hundred millions in ten years, and the man with a hundred millions\r\nmay have a thousand. There is not a king or an emperor on a throne\r\nto-day that would be safe a single moment with a subject possessing a\r\nthousand million dollars; and can it be expected that a Republic would\r\nbe safer? The wealth of the Rothschilds was for a long time the wonder\r\nof the world. They held the purse-strings of nearly all Europe; kings,\r\nemperors, and principalities were and are yet at their mercy. But the\r\nwealth of the Rothschilds, the accumulations of generations, pales\r\ninto insignificance before the wealth of the Vanderbilts, the Goulds,\r\nthe Astors, the Lelands, the Carnegies, and the Spreckels, when the\r\nperiod of acquisition is taken into account. History fails to record\r\nany accumulation of wealth so rapid and so colossal as that which has\r\ntaken place in this country, and during a period of from five to\r\ntwenty-five years.\r\n\r\nThe wealth of the Rothschilds has been the marvel of generations until\r\nwithin the past decade; but their wealth ceases to dazzle and\r\nbewilder even the youths of America in this generation. Their wealth,\r\nhowever, has been the accumulation of a hundred and twenty-five years,\r\nwith all Europe for their field of operations. Their accumulations do\r\nnot represent the robbery of the masses. They never levied a tax upon\r\nor demanded a toll upon the necessaries of life. Their operations were\r\nmainly confined to the negotiation of loans, the placing of\r\ninvestments for the wealthy men of Europe, and to the legitimate\r\nsphere of banking. They had a bank in the capitals of France, Austria,\r\nItaly, England, and Prussia; but neither of those nations ever gave\r\nthem the authority to issue money. The toiling millions of Europe are\r\ntaxed to maintain armies and support dynasties; but they were never\r\nthe subjects of a moneyed aristocracy, or victims to their cupidity,\r\nin the sense that American toilers are. Emperors and kings did indeed\r\nmake their burdens heavy, and oft-times intolerable, but they taxed to\r\nmaintain their governments. They were the sole despots or robbers; and\r\nthere is this difference between the robbers of Europe and those of\r\nAmerica: that European despots maintained a government, while the\r\nAmerican despots rob the people, by the aid of the government, for\r\npurely personal profit. True, the Rothschilds' power was great. They\r\ncould probably make or unmake kings; but their power was never used to\r\nbuild up towns and cities in one section of country and tear them down\r\nin another; to build up manufacturing establishments and great\r\ncommercial monopolies in one kingdom or state, and destroy them\r\nelsewhere. They never attempted to control lines of transportation,\r\ncorner the price of meat, bread, coffee, sugar, light, fuel, and other\r\nnecessaries of life. No such operations were ever attempted by them,\r\nand no king or emperor would have been safe a day upon his throne who\r\nwould have permitted such crimes as have been and are openly\r\nperpetrated by the millionaires of our country in their operations\r\nwith beef, pork, coffee, oil, coal, sugar, wheat, and almost every\r\nother necessary of life. Under an absolute, or even a limited\r\nmonarchy, these evils can be prevented or remedied; but as yet no\r\nmeans have been discovered to remedy or prevent them under our form of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nEvents of great magnitude crowd fast upon each other in our rapidly\r\ngrowing country. New questions of great importance and new phases of\r\nold questions have arisen and assumed huge proportions in a brief\r\nperiod, requiring the highest virtue, intelligence, and patriotism to\r\ndeal with; and, while yet there may appear no constitutional means for\r\nprotection against the illegitimate use of wealth under the operation\r\nof trusts and syndicates, without infringing upon the constitutional\r\nrights of citizens, it is absolutely certain that a way must be found\r\nto do so, or this great Republic, which promised so much for humanity,\r\nwill cease to exist, and the hope of a \"government of the people, for\r\nthe people, and by the people\" will be crushed from out the hearts of\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n                                        N. G. PARKER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A YOUNG GIRL'S IDEAL._\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are people one meets with now and then who seem so perfectly\r\nfitted to their age and condition that it is difficult and almost\r\npainful to imagine them in any other--some old ladies, for instance,\r\nso sweet-faced, cheery-hearted, and placid-minded that one rebels\r\nagainst the reflection that they were ever crude, impulsive girls or\r\nbusy matrons; and some busy matrons there are whose supply of energy\r\nand capacity seems so admirably to equal the demands made upon it\r\nthat, for them, girlhood and old age appear to be alike--states of\r\nlacking opportunity; and, in the third place, there are crude,\r\nimpulsive girls who wear these attributes so blithely that one does\r\nnot want to think of them developed and matured.\r\n\r\nOf these was Kate Severn, aged eighteen--a tall, brown-skinned,\r\nbrown-eyed, brown-haired creature, so richly and freshly tinted that\r\nthese three shades blended, in a beautiful harmony, in a face of\r\nrounded lines and gracious curves such as belong alone to the lovely\r\ntime of youth. She was an affectionate and dutiful daughter to her\r\nwidowed mother, whose only child she was, and yet almost everyone who\r\nheard Kate Severn talked about at all heard her called cold, the basis\r\nof this appellation being a disinclination to the society and\r\nattentions of young gentlemen, which, in a girl of her age and\r\nappearance, seemed a positive eccentricity. She had had this trait\r\nfrom a child, when she would fly into sudden rages and fight and\r\nscratch the little boys who called her their sweetheart; and it had\r\ngrown with her growth. Every summer, when she and her mother would\r\ncome back to the old country-place, near the dull little town of\r\nMarston, where all the summers of her life had been spent, this\r\ndetermination to avoid the society of young men was more resolutely\r\nset forth by her looks and tones. It was not so aggressive as\r\nformerly, for she had acquired a fine dignity with her advancing\r\ngirlhood, and was too proud not to avoid the danger of being called\r\nridiculous. Therefore, her resentment of all masculine approaches was\r\nnow quiet and severe, where it had once been angry and vehement; but\r\nit was as positive as ever, as the youth of Marston had reason to\r\nknow. They said they didn't mind it, but they did immensely. A\r\nfavorite remark among them was that, if she could stand it, they\r\ncould--and stand it she did, magnificently. Who that saw her, driving\r\nher smart trap and strong bay horse along the country roads of\r\nMarston, with rein taut and whip alert, her erect and beautiful figure\r\nstrikingly contrasted with her little mother's bent and fragile one,\r\ncould suppose for one instant that it mattered an atom to her whether\r\nthose were men or wooden images that walked the streets of Marston or\r\ndrove about its suburbs, having their salutes to the tall cart\r\nreturned by a swift, cool bow from its driver, who disdained to rest\r\nher handsome eyes upon them long enough to discern the half-indignant,\r\nhalf-admiring gazes with which they looked after her.\r\n\r\nShe was not, at heart, an unsocial creature, and in her childhood had\r\nbeen rather a favorite with the girls who came in contact with her,\r\nbut she always was unlike them; and this dissimilarity now constituted\r\na distinct isolation for her, since the fact that she had herself no\r\nbeaux,--to use the term in vogue in Marston society,--and took no\r\ninterest in hearing of those of her girl friends, left the latter much\r\nat a loss for topics, and forced upon Kate herself the conviction that\r\nshe had not the power of interesting them. Dr. Brett, the country\r\ndoctor who was her mother's physician and chief friend when she came\r\nto her country home, used to try to adjust matters for Kate, and made\r\nmany praiseworthy efforts to promote a spirit of sociability between\r\nher and the young people of Marston, each and every one of which was a\r\nflat failure. At last he had given up in despair and let the matter\r\ndrop, for Kate, in this her eighteenth summer, was more difficult, as\r\nwell as taller, straighter, and handsomer, than ever. So reflected Dr.\r\nBrett as he drove homeward from his first visit to the Severns,\r\nfeeling a good deal cheered by the recurrence into his humdrum life of\r\nthis attractive mother and daughter, who received him into their home\r\nwith a cordiality and friendliness enjoyed by a few people only. Mrs.\r\nSevern was an invalid, and unequal to seeing much company; and Kate,\r\nthough the very opposite of an invalid, had contrived, as I have\r\nshown, to cut herself off from society--in Marston, at least--rather\r\neffectually. She liked Dr. Brett, and seemed always glad to see him--a\r\ndeparture in his favor which he was not old enough to relish\r\naltogether. Still, the gods had provided him a pleasant spot of\r\nrefreshment in the midst of a rather dull professional routine, and\r\nhe gladly made the most of it. Kate, who was extremely fastidious,\r\ncriticized him severely to her mother, and regretted very often that a\r\nman who had some capabilities should neglect his appearance as he\r\ndid--allowing his face and hands to get so sunburned, his hair to grow\r\nso long, and his clothes to look so shabby and old-fashioned.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the reason that she was so hard upon good Dr. Brett was\r\naccounted for by the fact that this man-repudiating young lady carried\r\nabout in her mind a beautiful ideal of her own, of whose existence,\r\neven in this immaterial form, no being in the world besides herself\r\nhad a suspicion. His appearance, in truth, was wholly and entirely\r\nideal, but he was founded on fact, and that fact was a certain\r\nmanuscript which five years ago she had fished up from an old box in\r\nthe garret. This garret had been for generations the receptacle for\r\nall the old, disused belongings of the Severns; and it had been Kate's\r\ndelight, from childhood up, to explore its old chests and trunks, and\r\ninvent for herself vivid stories of the old-time ladies and gentlemen\r\nto whom had belonged these queer old gowns and uniforms--these scant\r\npetticoats and meagre waists, and these knee-breeches and lace-trimmed\r\ncoats. There were spinning-wheels and guitars to suggest poses for the\r\nwomen, and cocked hats and swords for the men. As she grew older,\r\nthese childish games lost part of their charm for her, and these mere\r\nsuits and trappings of the creatures of her imagination gave her such\r\na sense of lack that she turned to some old papers in one of the\r\nboxes, in the hope that she might get some light upon the spirits and\r\nsouls that had animated them. In her own fair young body there had\r\narisen certain insistent demands which there was nothing in the life\r\nshe led to supply. The tortures of the Inquisition would not have\r\ndrawn this confession from her; but so indeed it was, and I must have\r\nsketched the personality of this young lady very clumsily indeed if it\r\nhas not appeared that, beneath this independent, self-sufficing\r\nsurface, there was a heart full of romance and sentiment, a feeling\r\nall the stronger for being denied a vent.\r\n\r\nIt was an era in Kate Severn's life--that rainy day in late\r\nsummertime, when she found in the garret the old roll of manuscript\r\nfrom which was formulated the ideal that afterward so wholly took\r\npossession of her. It was a budget of closely written sheets, on blue\r\npaper turned white at the edges with age. The ink used must have been\r\nof exceptionally good quality, for it was still dark and distinct. The\r\nwriting was clear, and done with a very fine pen--but there were\r\nevidences of haste. This, however, was not to be wondered at, for the\r\nsubject was an exciting one, and Kate pictured to herself, with\r\nenthusiasm, the exquisite young gentleman (whom she promptly invested\r\nwith the blue-velvet, lace-ruffled coat, and the handsome hat and\r\nsword which were among the paraphernalia of the attic) bending his\r\nardent, impassioned gaze over the sheets on which were written such\r\nbeautiful, fervent, reverential love-words. It was not in the form of\r\na letter, though it was a direct appeal, or, rather, a sort of\r\naspiration, from the heart of a man for the love of a woman. There was\r\nnot a name in it from beginning to end, and there was a sort of\r\nimpersonal tone in it that made Kate believe that it was addressed to\r\nan imagined woman instead of a known one. This thought occurred to her\r\neven in that first breathless perusal, and all the subsequent ones\r\n(which were countless, for she was subject to certain moods in which\r\nthis old manuscript was her only balm) confirmed it. In consequence of\r\nthis conviction, she did a most un-Kate-like thing. It required only a\r\nslight effort of that powerful imagination of hers to put herself in\r\nthe place of this loved and importuned lady; and she actually went so\r\nfar as to compose and indite answer after answer to this fond\r\nappeal--impassioned outpourings of a heart which was full and had to\r\nbe emptied. These she would lock away in her desk, along with the\r\nprecious blue manuscript--and read and amplify from time to time.\r\n\r\nShe had never told anyone about the finding of this manuscript, though\r\nshe had questioned her mother frequently and closely about the various\r\ncontents of the attic boxes, only to hear repeated the statement that\r\nthey were all belongings of the Severns, and had been in the house\r\nlong before her occupancy. So this precious manuscript, it must\r\nappear, was written by some by-gone relative of her father, who, it\r\npleased her to believe, had died with all these beautiful aspirations\r\nunfulfilled. That was a thought that smiled upon far more than the\r\npicture of her ideal hero comfortably settled as a commonplace husband\r\nand father, with degenerate modern descendants. So Kate, who had no\r\nlovers in reality, made the most of this impalpable essence of one.\r\nAnd really he suited her much better. She could endow him with all the\r\nattributes that she admired, and even alter these at will, as her\r\nstate of mind changed or her tastes developed, and a real lover could\r\nnever have kept pace with her so well. Then, too, she could imagine\r\nhim as beautiful and elegant as she desired--and she loved beauty and\r\nelegance in a man so much that she had never seen one yet who came up\r\nto her standard. She invested him with the most gorgeous changes of\r\napparel--the blue velvet coat in the old trunk being one of his\r\ncommonest costumes. It is true that it did not occur to her that, to\r\nfit the wishes of the manuscript to the time of the knee-breeches and\r\nlace ruffles, etc., suggested the propriety of his expressing himself\r\nin old English, while that of the blue manuscript was quite modern;\r\nbut an anachronism or two of this sort was a trifling matter in so\r\nbroad a scheme as hers. One effect of the finding of the paper was to\r\nmake Miss Kate far more than ever scrupulous in her person, and gentle\r\nand courteous in her ways, for, although she had no superstitious idea\r\nthat he really saw her out of the spirit-world, still it was her pride\r\nand pleasure to be what she knew he would have her to be. So she\r\ndressed herself in very charming gowns, with a slight expression of\r\nold-timeness about them that was not unnatural, and wore her severe,\r\nscant coifs and little folded kerchief with a prim grace that was a\r\nmatter of contemporaneous benefit. Her mother and Dr. Brett got the\r\nmost of it, for out-of-doors her dress was necessarily conventional,\r\nand out-of-doors, also, she encountered so many antagonistic elements\r\nthat she was often made to feel that her bearing and state of mind\r\nwere not such as her loyal knight would have approved. That he was a\r\nperson of the gentlest heart, the kindest nature, the most loving\r\nspirit, no one who read those heartfelt words of his could doubt. Very\r\noften he would interrupt his rhapsodies to his lady-love to prostrate\r\nhimself before himself, at the thought of his unworthiness to ask the\r\nlove of so divine and perfect a being as her whom he addressed. How\r\ngreat, then, was the necessity laid upon her who had appropriated\r\nthese addresses to be circumspect in thought and act!\r\n\r\nSo Kate grew every day more sweet and winning, until Dr. Brett began\r\nto wonder how he could ever have thought her hard and conceited--as he\r\nconfessed to himself, with abasement, that he had. She felt that her\r\nknight and lover would have wished her to be kind to this poor, lonely\r\nold doctor, who was so good to the sick and humble about him, and led\r\nsuch a cheerless, companionless, bachelor existence; and she used to\r\nmake his cup of tea in the evenings when he would drop in to see her\r\nmother at the close of a hard day's work, and minister to his comfort\r\nin a manner that was certainly new to her. Before the finding of that\r\nmanuscript, it was little enough that she had cared about his comfort;\r\nbut now it seemed of real importance to her. The more his country-made\r\nclothes, and sun-burned hands, and awkward, heavy shoes grated on her,\r\nthe more it came home to her how she would be pleasing some one who\r\nwore velvet coats, with rich lace ruffles that bordered tapering white\r\nhands, and with shapely feet encased in fine silk stockings and fine\r\ndiamond-buckled slippers--if he could see her! Hers was quite a happy\r\nlove affair, and she had no occasion to mourn her lover dead, as she\r\nhad not known him living--so, as yet, he had brought only pleasure\r\ninto her life.\r\n\r\nIt was at the age of sixteen that Kate had found the blue manuscript,\r\nand so her _affaire_ was a matter of two years' date when she returned\r\nto Marston on the occasion of her eighteenth summer. The blue-coated\r\nknight had held his own with inviolate security during those two\r\nyears, and Kate was as indifferent as ever to the approaches of the\r\nyouth and valor of Marston. So she and her mother settled quickly down\r\ninto the routine of the old dull life. The usual visitors called, but\r\nthey, too, were dull, and therefore undisturbing, and life flowed\r\nmonotonously on. It was only a little less quiet existence than the\r\none she led in winter in the city, for she never went to parties, and\r\nnot often to the theatre unless there happened to be some unusual\r\nmusical attraction; and her friends and relatives, of whom there were\r\nquite a number, gave her up as an incorrigibly queer girl, whom no one\r\nneed try and do anything for. It is true she had her music and\r\npainting lessons there, which were some variety and diversion, but she\r\npractised both here in the country; and the life, on the whole,\r\npleased her better. Her eccentricity, as it was called, was commented\r\non by fewer people, and she had more time for those delicious reveries\r\nover the old blue manuscript. She loved, on rainy days, when it was\r\nnot too warm up there, to steal off to the garret and look at the blue\r\ncoat, and the sword, and hat, etc., and feel herself a little nearer,\r\nin that way, to her knight. It seemed a very lonely time indeed, when\r\nshe looked back to the years and days before the finding of the\r\nmanuscript. It had introduced an element into her life almost as\r\nstrong as reality. And yet there were times--and they came oftener,\r\nnow that womanhood was ripening--when a great emptiness and longing\r\ngot hold of her, and the blue manuscript, which had once been so\r\nsufficient, would not satisfy her. She hugged it closer to her heart\r\nthan ever, though, and all it represented to her. She often told\r\nherself it suited her a great deal better than marriage, which she had\r\nalways looked upon as a grinding and grovelling existence for a woman,\r\nand expressed and felt a fine superiority to. It was quite too\r\ncommonplace and humdrum an affair for her, and she told herself, with\r\nemphasis and distinctness, that she was quite content with an ideal\r\nlove. And yet, to mock her, came the thought of the pictured domestic\r\nlife which the blue manuscript had so tenderly described--with such\r\nlongings for the fireside, the home circle, the family love that she\r\nheld in scorn. She got the old blue paper and read it over, and those\r\nwords of winning tenderness brought the tears to her eyes. She found\r\nherself half wishing, for his sake, while a numb pain seized her heart\r\nfor herself, that he had lived to realize these sweet dreams of home\r\nand domestic love. If that was so, her ideal was gone, and how could\r\nshe do without it, seeing she had nothing else? The tears became too\r\nthick, the pain in her throat was unsupportable, she felt the great\r\nsobs rising, and, springing up, she rushed down the stairs, flew to\r\nher room, bathed her face and adjusted her toilet, and then went down\r\nto make tea for her mother and Dr. Brett, after which she played away\r\nthe spirit of sadness and unrest with all the gay and brilliant music\r\nshe knew. By bed-time she was her own calm self, and the next day she\r\nregarded her strange mood with wonder, but she could not forget that\r\nit had been, and she was horribly afraid of its recurrence.\r\n\r\nOne morning she was driving herself alone in her pretty cart along a\r\nshady road that ran outside the town, when she recognized Dr. Brett's\r\nbuggy and horse fastened to a tree near a small shady house. This was\r\nnothing to surprise her, for he was always working away on poor and\r\nhelpless people who couldn't pay him, and she would have passed on\r\nwithout giving the matter a second thought, but that, just as she got\r\nto the dilapidated little gate, a woman rushed out of the house, with\r\na girl of about fourteen after her, both of them screaming and\r\nthrowing their hands about in a way that caused Kate's horse to take\r\nfright and gave her all she could do to control him for the next few\r\nminutes. He ran for a little way straight down the road, but she soon\r\ngot him in hand and turned back to inquire into the cause of the\r\ntrouble. The two females were still whooping and gesticulating in the\r\nyard, and the scene had been furthermore enlivened by the addition of\r\nthree or four dirty and half-clothed children, who were also crying.\r\nJust as Kate came up, Dr. Brett appeared in the doorway, with his coat\r\noff and a very angry expression on his face. He caught hold of the\r\nwoman and gave her an energetic shake, telling her to hold her tongue\r\nand control her children; and just at this point he looked up and\r\ncaught sight of Kate, gazing down upon the scene from the top of her\r\npretty cart, whose horse was now as quiet as a lamb.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Kate, while the whole party suspended\r\ntheir screams a moment to gaze at her.\r\n\r\n\"I wish to goodness you could help me,\" said Dr. Brett, half\r\ndesperately. \"I was about to perform a very simple operation on this\r\nwoman's child and had everything in readiness, supposing I could trust\r\nher to assist me, when she began to bawl like an idiot, and\r\ndemoralized this child who was helping me, too, and simply upset the\r\nwhole thing. I came out to see if there was anyone in sight who could\r\ngive me some assistance; but of course--\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll help you,\" said Kate at once, beginning to get down from the\r\ncart. \"I suppose if these people could do it I could--at least I won't\r\nlose my head.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if you only would help!\" said Dr. Brett. \"I can't stop to tie\r\nyour horse even. I must see about the child. Here, somebody come tie\r\nthis horse, and keep out of the way, every one of you! If I hear any\r\nmore howling out here, I'll box the ears of the whole party!\" And with\r\nthese words he disappeared into the house.\r\n\r\nA small boy came up and took the horse's rein, and the woman promised\r\neagerly that they would take care of everything. She was still half\r\nsobbing, and began to make excuses for herself, saying she couldn't a\r\nstayed to see it done, not if she'd die for it.\r\n\r\nKate did not stop to listen to her, but ran up the rickety steps,\r\ndrawing off her long gloves as she did so, and entered the wretched\r\nlittle room. She had only time to take in its expression of squalor\r\nand destitution, when she paused abruptly, affrighted, in spite of\r\nherself, at the sight before her. On a table in the middle of the room\r\nwas stretched a little child, dressed in a clean white frock, and with\r\na fair little face, above which gleamed a mass of rich auburn curls.\r\nShe glanced at the pretty face in its statuesque repose, and then saw\r\nthat the little legs, bare from the knees, were horribly deformed, the\r\nfeet being curled inward in a frightfully distorted manner.\r\n\r\n\"Is it dead?\" said Kate, in a hushed whisper.\r\n\r\n\"Dead? My dear young lady, you don't suppose I've asked you to assist\r\nat a post-mortem,\" said the doctor cheerily, as he chose an instrument\r\nout of his case. \"It's bad enough as it is. I don't know what I'll say\r\nof myself when this thing's over. But tell me! do you think you can\r\nstand it? There'll be only a few drops of blood. But I can put it off,\r\nif you say so. Tell the truth!\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want you to put it off,\" said Kate. \"I am perfectly ready to\r\nhelp you. Tell me what to do.\"\r\n\r\nShe smelt the strong fumes of chloroform now, and realized that the\r\nchild was under its influence and would feel no pain, and the\r\nknowledge strengthened her. She watched the doctor as he bent over and\r\nlifted one little hand, letting it drop back heavily, and then raised\r\nup one eyelid, for a second, and examined the pupil.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" he said. \"Now, are you frightened or nervous?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not in the least,\" she answered, calmly, feeling a wonderful strength\r\ncome into her as she met his steady, confident, reassuring gaze. It\r\nwas strange, but it was the first time she had noticed how fine his\r\neyes were.\r\n\r\n\"That's right,\" he said; \"I knew you were not a coward. Now you must\r\nwatch the child's face carefully, and at the first movement or sign of\r\nreturning consciousness you must douse some chloroform out of that\r\nbottle inside that towel, and hold it cone-shaped, as it is, over the\r\nbaby's nose and mouth; I'll tell you how long. Don't be frightened;\r\nthere's not the least danger of giving too much, and the operation is\r\nextremely simple and short.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke the baby contracted its face a little and turned its head.\r\n\r\n\"See--I'll show you,\" he said. And wetting the towel from the bottle\r\nhe put it over the baby's face and held it there a little while,\r\nlooking up at Kate, into whose face a sweet compassion had gathered,\r\nsoftening and beautifying it wonderfully. She was not looking at him,\r\nbut down at the baby; and with a wonderful movement of tenderness she\r\nlaid her fair hand on the poor deformed feet and gave them a little\r\ngentle pressure. She was utterly unconscious of herself or she\r\ncouldn't have done it. Theoretically, she hated children.\r\n\r\nThe doctor now took his position at the foot of the table, and holding\r\none of the child's feet in his hand, felt with his thumb and\r\nforefinger for a second and then made a slight incision. Kate saw one\r\nbig drop of blood come out and then turned her eyes to the face of the\r\nchild, as she had been instructed. The little creature was sleeping as\r\nsweetly as if in a noonday nap, and looked so unconscious and placid\r\nthat it seemed all the more pitiful. She bent over and smoothed the\r\nbright curls, and then kissed the soft cheek.\r\n\r\n\"Poor little man!\" she murmured, softly. She thought no one heard.\r\nSuddenly, behind her, there was a little snap.\r\n\r\n\"Hear that?\" said the doctor, cheerfully. \"_That's_ all right.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked around and saw he was holding his thumb over the little cut\r\nhe had made, and looking across at her with an encouraging smile.\r\n\r\n\"You're first-rate,\" he said, heartily. \"I wish that screaming idiot\r\ncould see how a brave woman behaves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, but she is its mother!\" said Kate, in a tender voice, \"and it's\r\nsuch a little dear. I don't wonder she loves it!\"\r\n\r\nWas this really Kate Severn? He didn't have time to think whether it\r\nwas or not, for the blood had stopped, and he now took up the other\r\nfoot. At the same time the baby moved again and gave a little whimper.\r\nKate promptly doused the towel and put it over the child's face, who,\r\nat its next breath, relapsed into unconsciousness.\r\n\r\n\"First-rate!\" said the doctor again. \"That will do for this time,\" and\r\nthen proceeded with the other foot. Again Kate heard the little\r\nsnapping sound, as the tendon was cut, though her eyes were fixed upon\r\nthe placid face of the child.\r\n\r\n\"Now look, if you want to see a pair of straight little feet,\" said\r\nthe doctor. And she turned around and saw, as he had said, instead of\r\nthat curled deformity, two natural childish feet.\r\n\r\n\"Wonderful!\" said the girl. \"Oh, how thankful you must be that you are\r\ncapable of such a thing as this!\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor laughed his cheery, pleasant laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Why next to nobody could do that,\" he said. But it was plain that her\r\ncommendation pleased him.\r\n\r\nHe then rapidly explained to her how into the vessel of warm water\r\nstanding by she was to dip the little rolls of plaster spread between\r\nlong strips of gauze, and rolled up like bolts of ribbon, and squeeze\r\nthem out and hand them to him very promptly as he needed them.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind watching the baby,\" he said. \"If it cries you must clap\r\nthe towel over its face. You've got enough to do to watch me, and hand\r\nme the plaster as I need it.\"\r\n\r\nKate obeyed implicitly, and in a little while both feet had been\r\ndeftly and neatly bandaged, from the toes to the knees, with the\r\nplaster bandages, and the little creature, appearing suddenly\r\nunnaturally long from this transformation, was pronounced intact.\r\n\r\n\"That's all,\" said the doctor. \"As soon as I wash my hands I'll lay it\r\non the bed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me,\" said Kate, hastily drying her own hands. And while he\r\npretended to be engrossed in his ablutions he watched her curiously,\r\nas she lifted the baby tenderly and laid it on the bed. As she put it\r\ndown she bent over and kissed it, murmuring sweet words, as a mother\r\nmight have done.\r\n\r\n\"You must have the legs very straight,\" he said, coming over and\r\nstanding at the bed's foot that he might the more accurately see them.\r\n\"In an hour the plaster will be perfectly hard, and then they can move\r\nit anywhere. That's a good job, if we did do it ourselves,\" he said,\r\nwith a bright smile.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, may I go and tell the mother?\" said Kate, eagerly. \"How happy\r\nshe'll be to see those straight little legs!\"\r\n\r\nShe went out and called the mother in. The woman's excitement had\r\nchanged into stolidness, and she showed far less feeling in the matter\r\nthan Kate had done. She looked at the child, without speaking, and\r\nthen said she guessed she'd better clean up all this muss, and\r\nproceeded to set things to rights. Kate was indignant, and showed it\r\nin the look she cast at Dr. Brett, who smiled indulgently in reply,\r\nand said in a low tone, coming near her, \"That manner is half\r\nembarrassment. I'm sure she really cares.\"\r\n\r\nWhile he was wiping and putting up his instruments, Kate went back to\r\nthe bed, a little whimper having warned her that baby was coming to.\r\n\r\n\"Don't let him move if you can help it,\" said the doctor, and she\r\ndropped on her knees by the bed, and began to talk to the child in the\r\nprettiest way, taking out her watch and showing it to him, holding it\r\nto his ear that he might hear it tick, and occupying his attention so\r\nsuccessfully that he lay quite still, gazing up at her with great\r\nearnest brown eyes, and giving a simultaneous little grin and grunt\r\nnow and then. Dr. Brett came up and stood behind her for a few moments\r\nunnoticed, observing her with a strange scrutiny. \"Who would have\r\nexpected a thing like this from this queer girl?\" he said to himself.\r\nThen, aloud, he informed Miss Severn that the baby might safely be\r\nleft to its mother now; and she got up at once, and, seeing he was\r\nready to go, followed him out of the house.\r\n\r\nHe unfastened her horse and brought the cart to the gate, and, as she\r\nmounted to her seat and took the reins, she looked down at him and\r\nsaid impulsively:\r\n\r\n\"I'm so glad you let me help you. Is this your life--going about all\r\nthe time doing good and curing evil? I never thought how beautiful it\r\nwas. If I can ever give you help again, let me do it; won't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"That you shall,\" he said, and seemed about to add more, but something\r\nstopped the words in his throat, and she drove off, wondering what\r\nthey would have been. The mingled surprise and delight in his eyes\r\nmade her long to know them. As she turned a bend in the road, she\r\nlooked back and saw Dr. Brett standing in the door among the children,\r\nwith a hand on the head of one of the untidy little boys, looking down\r\nat him kindly. His figure was certainly both handsome and impressive,\r\nand his head and profile fine. She wondered she had never noticed this\r\nbefore--but then she had never before been really interested in him.\r\nShe wondered suddenly how old he was.\r\n\r\nAll the way home she was thinking about him, and how good, and\r\ncheerful, and strong, and clever he was; how everyone loved him, and\r\nwhat a power he had of making people feel better and brighter as soon\r\nas he came into the room. She began to recall accounts she had heard,\r\nwith rather a listless interest, of difficult and successful surgical\r\noperations he had performed, and inducements offered him to go to big\r\ncities and make money, of which he had refused to avail himself simply\r\nbecause he loved his own people and had his hands full of work where\r\nhe was. This was a fine and uncommon feeling, the girl reflected. Why\r\nhad she never appreciated Dr. Brett before? By the time she reached\r\nhome she had worked herself into quite a fever of appreciation, and\r\nshe had a glowing account of the operation to give to her mother, who\r\nlistened with great interest.\r\n\r\n\"How old is he, mamma?\" she said, as she concluded.\r\n\r\n\"I really don't know. I never thought,\" said her mother. \"He can't be\r\nmuch over thirty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do ask him his age--I'd really like to know. It's wonderful for such\r\na young man to be so much as he is. I never thought of his being young\r\nbefore--but thirty is young, of course.\"\r\n\r\nAfter that morning's experience Kate and Dr. Brett became fast\r\nfriends--on a very different footing from the old one. He told her\r\nabout his patients, and took her with him sometimes to see them,\r\ntempering the wind to her with tender thoughtfulness, and refraining\r\nher eyes from seeing some of the forms of want and wretchedness that\r\nwere common things to him; but in what she did see there was\r\nopportunity for much loving ministration; and her visits to those poor\r\ndwellings with him were in most cases followed by visits alone, when\r\nshe would carry little gifts for the children and delicacies for the\r\nsick, along with the sweeter benefit of a sympathetic presence that\r\nknew, by a singular tact, how to be helpful without obtrusiveness.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all these new interests it was not remarkable that the\r\nIdeal fell into the background. Sometimes for days he would be\r\nforgotten. He didn't harmonize with these practical pursuits; and,\r\neven when old habit sometimes conjured up his image in Kate's mind, it\r\nalways made a sort of discord, and, what was worse, made her feel\r\nfoolish in a way that she hated. She hadn't been to the garret for a\r\nlong time. There was something that gave her a painful sense of\r\nabsurdity in the mere thought of the blue velvet coat, and the cocked\r\nhat and sword. What could a man do with those things in this day and\r\ngeneration? She thought of Dr. Brett's brown hands encumbered with\r\nlace ruffles in the sort of work he had to do, and in her heart of\r\nhearts she knew that she preferred the work to the ruffles.\r\n\r\nBut the more the exterior belongings of her Ideal grated on her now,\r\nthe more she hugged to her heart his soul and spirit, as expressed in\r\nthe old blue manuscript. She read it more eagerly and more\r\npersistently than ever, and, every time, its lovely words and loving\r\nthoughts sank deeper in her heart, carrying a strange unrest there\r\nthat was yet sweeter than anything had ever been to her before. All\r\nthose longings for a beautiful and perfect love seemed now to come\r\nfrom herself--from the sacredest depth of her soul--rather than to be\r\naddressed to her.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon (it was rainy, and she could not go to drive as usual,\r\nand she no longer cared for her garret _séances_, which would once\r\nhave seemed so appropriate to a day like this) she was sitting at the\r\npiano, playing to her mother, when Dr. Brett came in. He had not been\r\nto see them for many days--a most unusual thing--and she had felt\r\nneglected and hurt by it. Perhaps it was this feeling that made her\r\nvery quiet in her greeting of him, or perhaps it was the melancholy,\r\nwilful strain of music into which she had wandered--plaintive minor\r\nthings that seemed made to touch the founts of tears. At all events\r\nshe did not feel like talking, and she drew away, after a few formal\r\nwords, and left him to talk to her mother. He explained at once,\r\nhowever, that he had not come to stay, but to ask Mrs. Severn's\r\npermission to go up into the garret and look for something in an old\r\nbox which she had permitted him to store there before he had built the\r\nhouse he was now occupying. Mrs. Severn remembered the fact that he\r\nhad once sent a box there, and of course gave him the permission he\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\n\"Kate will go with you,\" she said; \"the garret is a favorite resort of\r\nhers, and she can help you to find your box.\"\r\n\r\nSo bidden, Kate was compelled to go; but she felt a strange reluctance\r\npossessing her as she mounted the stairs ahead of Dr. Brett. When\r\nthey were in the great, wide-reaching, low-ceilinged room so familiar\r\nto her, she thought of the paraphernalia of her Ideal, and felt more\r\nfoolish than she had ever felt yet. What an idiot Dr. Brett would\r\nthink her if he knew of the impalpable object on which she had\r\nlavished so much feeling! She thought of the Ideal that had once been\r\nso much to her, and then looked at Dr. Brett. How real he was! how\r\nstrong, capable, living! What a powerful, warm-impulsed actuality,\r\ncompared to that unresponsive void! She surprised the good doctor by\r\nturning to him a face suffused by a vivid blush. He looked at her\r\nintently for a second, as if he would give a great deal to find out\r\nthe meaning of that blush, but he recollected himself, and said\r\nsuddenly:\r\n\r\n\"There is the old box. It had no lock on it, but that precaution was\r\nnot necessary, for no one would ever care to possess themselves of\r\nthat old plunder. It was mostly papers, and servants are not apt to\r\ntamper with them.\"\r\n\r\nHe walked over and opened the box, without looking at Kate, who had\r\nturned pale as a ghost and was standing like one transfixed, with her\r\neyes riveted to him. He knelt down and began to turn over, one by one,\r\nthe parcels of papers, which were labelled on the outside and were\r\nprincipally old deeds and account-books. When he had gone to the\r\nbottom of the trunk, he said, without turning:\r\n\r\n\"I cannot find what I want, and yet I know it was in this box. It was\r\na--a--certain paper of mine, that I put in here years ago. I should\r\nknow it in an instant, because it was written on some old blue paper,\r\nbleached white at the edges with age, that I happened to have at hand,\r\nand used for the purpose. I thought I should never want it again, but\r\nnow I am anxious to reclaim it. It's too bad,\" he went on, putting the\r\nparcels back in the box; \"every piece of this old trumpery seems to be\r\nhere but that.\"\r\n\r\nHe got up and closed the lid, and, taking out his handkerchief, wiped\r\nhis hands, and then began to flick the dust from the knees of his\r\ntrousers. Kate still stood motionless, and, when at last he looked at\r\nher, his countenance showed him so startled by her expression that she\r\nwas obliged to speak.\r\n\r\n\"I know where it is,\" she said; \"I've got it. I didn't know it was\r\nyours. Oh, how could it be yours? I thought it was--\"\r\n\r\n\"You've got it?\" he said; \"and you've read it?\" And now it was his\r\nturn to blush. \"Have you really read it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" she said. \"I've read it--and over, and over, and over. How\r\ncould I know? I thought it belonged to us. I thought all these old\r\nboxes were ours, and I thought of course that old faded paper was\r\nwritten by some one years and years ago--some one long dead and\r\nburied.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so it was,\" he said--\"at least, it was written some years ago\r\nindeed, and by a rash fellow, full of the impulsiveness and fire of\r\nyouth, whom I thought dead and buried too, until these last few weeks\r\nhave brought him to life again. He's come back--for what, I don't\r\nknow; but I could get no rest until I tried to find that old, romantic\r\noutpouring of my passionate, hungry thoughts, written one night in\r\nred-hot haste and excitement, and addressed to a shadowy ideal of my\r\nown fancying, and proved to myself how absolutely they were realized\r\nat last--\" he paused an instant, and then went on impulsively \"--by\r\nyou, Kate!--by you, in all your loveliness and goodness. If you have\r\nread those pages, you know how big my expectations were, how\r\ntremendous my desires. Then, let me tell you that you realize them all\r\nbeyond my fondest dreams. I know you don't love me, Kate,\" he said,\r\ncoming near and taking both her hands. \"I know a rough old fellow like\r\nme could never win your love. I didn't mean to tell you about it. I\r\nnever would have, but for this. I know that you don't love me; but I\r\nlove you, all the same.\"\r\n\r\nKate would not give him her eyes to read, but he felt her hands shake\r\nin his, and he could see that her lips were trembling. What did it\r\nmean? Perhaps, after all--He was on fire with a sudden hope.\r\n\r\n\"Kate,\" he whispered, drawing her toward him by the two hands he still\r\nheld fast, \"perhaps you do--it seems too wonderful--but perhaps you do\r\na little--just a little bit--enough to make me hope the rest might\r\ncome. Oh, if you do, my Kate, my beautiful, my darling, tell me!\"\r\n\r\nShe drew her hands away from him and buried her face.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't love you a little at all,\" she said, half-chokingly. \"I\r\nlove you a great, great deal. I know the truth now.\"\r\n\r\nThen he took her in his arms and drew her tight against his heart.\r\nWhen her lips were close to his ear, she spoke again:\r\n\r\n\"I knew it the moment you said you had written that paper. I loved\r\nwhoever wrote that, already--but it wasn't that. I knew I loved _you_\r\nbecause it made me so unhappy, so wretched, for that minute when I\r\nthought maybe you had written those words to some one else you\r\nloved--and then you _couldn't_ love me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me tell you,\" he whispered back: \"'Some one else' never existed.\r\nThere never was anyone that could command the first emotion of love\r\nfrom me until you came. But, like many a foolish creature, I have\r\nloved an ideal, tenderly, faithfully, abidingly, and to her these\r\npassionate words were written. Now do you think me irretrievably\r\nsilly? Can you ever respect me again?\"\r\n\r\nFor answer, she told him her own little story, and even got out the\r\ncocked hat and sword and blue velvet coat, and showed them to him, in\r\na happy glee. He made an effort to take them from her and put them on;\r\nbut she prevented him, indignantly.\r\n\r\n\"You shall not!\" she exclaimed; \"I should be ashamed of you! A fine\r\ntime you'd have wrapping plaster bandages, with those ridiculous lace\r\nruffles! Oh, I like you a thousand times better as you are.\"\r\n\r\nHe caught her in his arms and kissed her--a fervent, passionate, happy\r\nkiss.\r\n\r\n\"Go and get the paper,\" he said, as he released her, \"and let us read\r\nit together, or, rather, let me read it to you--to whom it was written\r\nin the beginning. My ideal is realized.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so is mine,\" she said. \"How silly we are!\"\r\n\r\n\"But aren't we happy?\" he answered. And then they both laughed like\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nShe broke away from him and ran noiselessly down stairs, and get the\r\ndear blue paper and brought it to him, and then, seated beside him on\r\na rickety bench, with his arm around her waist, she listened while he\r\nread. There were many interruptions; many loving looks and tender\r\npressures; many fervent, happy kisses. As he read the last words the\r\npaper fell from his hands, and they looked at each other, with smiling\r\nlips and brimming eyes. For one brief instant they rested so, and then\r\nboth pairs of arms reached out and they were locked in a close\r\nembrace. No words were spoken--that silence was too sweet.\r\n\r\nAnd this was their betrothal.\r\n\r\n                                        JULIA MAGRUDER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THISTLE-DOWN._\r\n\r\n\r\n    All silver-shod within a weed's\r\n    Dark heart, a thousand tiny steeds\r\n    Were tethered in one stall. Each wee heart\r\n    Panted for flight, and longed to start\r\n    Upon the race-course just beyond their walls;\r\n    And, while they waited, down the silent stalls\r\n    The wind swept softly, and, with fingers light,\r\n    Bridled the thistle horses for their flight.\r\n\r\n                                        ANNIE BRONSON KING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_NOVELISTS ON NOVELS._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has sometimes been a matter of pious speculation with literary and\r\ndramatic circles what Shakespeare's personal views on art and\r\nliterature would have been had the enterprise and liberality of \"Great\r\nEliza's Golden Days\" induced him to formulate them. A simple and\r\ncredulous few have been disposed to regret the absence of any\r\nauthentic enunciation beyond the curt maxims and, as it were,\r\nfractions of canons scattered throughout his dramas.\r\n\r\nThese ardent hero-worshippers dream fondly of the light the master\r\nmight have cast on many important points, which can now only be dimly\r\ndescried in twilight or guessed at by mere inference, and sigh at the\r\nthought of what the world has lost. Others, rationally and soberly\r\nagnostic, have been saved the heartache and intranquillity of their\r\nbrethren, by the very natural and not too profound reflection that it\r\nis entirely problematic whether the actor-lessee of the Blackfriar's\r\nplayhouse could have expressed an opinion worth a pinch of salt on any\r\nvital æsthetic question, even supposing him as eager to give as we to\r\nreceive. Assumption is dangerous; and the possession of the creative\r\nfaculty by no means implies the possession of the critical.\r\n\r\nTrue, for--\r\n\r\n    \"No two virtues, whatever relation they claim,\r\n    Nor even two different shades of the same,\r\n    Though like as was ever twin brother to brother,\r\n    Possessing the one shall imply you've the other.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in certain circumstances, \"the high priori road is\r\npermissible to the adventurous traveller.\" With those happily\r\nconstituted persons who can imagine Shakespeare writing anything quite\r\nworthless even in the abstruse and difficult domain of scientific\r\ncriticism--where so many high qualities are required which are not\r\nheld to be essential to the mere creative--I disclaim the remotest\r\ndesire to provoke a quarrel. Rather let me frankly congratulate them\r\non their force of imagination. But those of a simpler faith and a\r\nscantier imaginative endowment will probably incline to the belief\r\nthat the brain which fashioned \"Lear\" and \"Othello\" could, under the\r\ngolden stimulus so potent to-day, have given us pertinent, perhaps\r\neven canotic comments on--say, \"Every Man in his Humor,\" or \"A Mad\r\nWorld my Masters,\" or \"The White Devil.\" Would it be heretical to\r\nsuppose the author of \"Macbeth\" capable of dissecting an ancient play\r\nin as keen and true a scientific spirit as that in which the _Saturday\r\nReview_ dissects a modern novel? The encumbrance of a conscience\r\nmight, indeed, be a serious detriment, inasmuch as it would impair the\r\npungency of his remarks. His fantastic notions of the quality of mercy\r\nmight lead him to exaggerate merits, his lack of a sustaining sense of\r\nself-omniscience to a fatal diffidence in pronouncing on defects; so\r\nthat his judgments would lack that fine Jeffreys-like flavor of\r\njudicial rigor which makes _Saturday Review_ a synonym for sterling\r\nJedburgh justice wherever the beloved and venerable name is known. He\r\nmight prove a honey-bee without a sting; a grave defect at a time when\r\nthe sting is esteemed more than the honey-bag. Yet, it is not\r\nimprobable that, with a little judicious training and proper\r\nenlightenment on the foolishness of sentiment, he would have made a\r\ntolerable critic, for, as has been discriminatingly observed of\r\nSophocles, the man is not without indications of genius. At any rate,\r\nin later and better appointed times, we have seen the German\r\nShakespeare, and others of the lawless tribe of creators, enter the\r\nfield of criticism and win approbation. It is true that Scott and\r\nByron, if not exactly categorically related to Mr. Thomas Rymer, were\r\nstill but indifferent critics; but we could readily tilt the scale by\r\nthrowing Pope, Wordsworth, and Shelley into the other, and yet have\r\nMr. Arnold, Mr. Swinburne, Mr. Lowell, and Mr. Lang in reserve.\r\n\r\nAnd, in truth, as there are obvious reasons why lawyers make the best\r\njudges, _ci devant_ thieves the best detectives, reformed drunkards\r\nthe best temperance advocates, and the scared sinners (like John\r\nBunyan) the best preachers, so there are obvious reasons why an\r\nartist's opinions of the productions of creative art, especially of\r\nthe productions of that branch of it wherein he labors himself, should\r\nhave peculiar value. His intimate acquaintance with the principles of\r\nart should not be detrimental to his perspicacity as a critic.\r\nFielding's success with Parson Adams would not, I conceive, be any\r\nhindrance to his success in a criticism of the character of Lieutenant\r\nLismahago, nor would the packed essences of \"Esmond\" prove Thackeray\r\nincapable of passing a competent judgment on \"David Copperfield.\"\r\n\r\nThe fact is, practice has its advantages over theory. To the\r\nintelligent, experience is something more than mere empiricism, and\r\nsome value must be conceded to personal experience. Theory is a wench\r\nof great personal attractions, with the coquette's knack of making\r\nthe most of them; but she bears the same relation to her plainer,\r\nplodding elder sister Practice that Mark Twain bore to the invaluable\r\nDan, when that doughty henchman was deputed to take exercise for the\r\nlanguid humorist. Mark might have the liveliest idea of the rugged\r\ngrandeur of the Alps, but Dan knew the toils of the ascent and the\r\nglories of the higher prospects; and though Mark was an invincible\r\ntheoretical mountain-climber, Dan would be apt to prove the more\r\ntrustworthy guide.\r\n\r\nIt was with the view of securing the directions of practical guides\r\nfor the reader, in another field of exploration, that the present\r\npaper was written. I may say at once that my object in seeking the\r\nnotes--so kindly and courteously placed at my disposition--was not to\r\ngratify idle curiosity with any pungent mess of personal gossip. That\r\ndignified office I gladly leave to the accomplished purveyors of the\r\nSociety papers. But I conceived that the curtest expression of the\r\ngenuine artist concerning the productions of his own art could not\r\nfail to be valuable as well as interesting. The critics, like our\r\ncreditors, we have always with us, to remind us we are still far from\r\nZion, and the former are just as indispensable to us, in the present\r\nstate of the world, as the latter. Unfortunately, neither enjoy\r\nimmunity from the universal law of human imperfection. Creditors are\r\nnot always generous nor critics always just. One grave difficulty with\r\nthe latter is the insidiousness of personal predilection, which cannot\r\nbe wholly excluded from the catholic judgment. Different judges have\r\ndifferent tastes. One may have a preference for Burgandy and the other\r\nfor champagne, while a third may prefer old port to either. The moral\r\nis obvious, and points to the prudence of occasionally bringing\r\nproducers and consumers face to face; having done which I will\r\nwithdraw for the present.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _From Mr. Robert Buchanan._\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR: It is difficult to say off-hand what novel I consider\r\n    my prime favorite. So much depends upon the mood of the moment\r\n    and point of view. I should say, generally, that the \"Vicar of\r\n    Wakefield\" surpassed all English tales, if I did not remember\r\n    that Fielding had created Parson Adams; but again, I have got\r\n    more pleasure out of Dickens' masterpiece, \"David Copperfield,\"\r\n    than all the others put together. Yes, I fix on \"David\r\n    Copperfield\"--from which, you will gather that I do not solicit\r\n    in fiction the kind of romance I have myself tried to weave.\r\n\r\n    Again, in all the region of foreign fiction, I see no such\r\n    figure as Balzac, and no such pathetic creation as \"Cousin\r\n    Pons.\" That to me is a divine story, far deeper and truer, of\r\n    course, than anything in Dickens, but alas! so sad. While I\r\n    tremble at Balzac's insight, I have the childish faith of\r\n    Dickens; he at least made the world brighter than he found it,\r\n    and after all, there are worse things than his gospel of\r\n    plum-pudding. When I am well and strong and full of life, I can\r\n    bear the great tragedians, like the Elizabethan group, like\r\n    Balzac; but when I am ill and wearied out with the world, I\r\n    turn again to our great humorist to gain happiness and help.\r\n\r\n                    ROBERT BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _From Mr. Hall Caine._\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR SIR: I am not a great reader of novels. My favorite\r\n    reading is dramatic poetry and old ballads. Few novelists can\r\n    have read fewer novels. During the last five years I have\r\n    certainly not read a score of new ones. But I am constantly\r\n    reading _in_ the old ones. Portions of chapters that live\r\n    vividly in my memory, scenes, passages of dialogue, scraps of\r\n    description--these I read and re-read. I could give you a list\r\n    of fifty favorite passages, but I would find it hard to say\r\n    which is my favorite novel. The mood of the moment would have\r\n    much to do with any judgment made on that head. When I am out\r\n    of heart Scott suits me well, for his sky is always serene.\r\n    When I am in high spirits I enjoy Thackeray, for it is only\r\n    then that I find any humor in the odd and the ugly. Dickens\r\n    suits me in many moods; there was not a touch of uncharity in\r\n    that true soul. There are moments when the tenderness of\r\n    Richardson is not maudlin, and when his morality is more\r\n    wholesome than that of Goldsmith. Sometimes I find the humor of\r\n    Sterne the most delicious thing out of Cervantes, and sometimes\r\n    I am readier to cry than to laugh over \"The Life and Deeds of\r\n    Don Quixote.\" So that if I were to tell you that in my judgment\r\n    this last book is on the whole the most moving piece of\r\n    imaginative writing known to me,--strongest in epic spirit,\r\n    fullest of inner meaning, the book that touches whatever is\r\n    deepest and highest in me,--I should merely be saying that it\r\n    is the last romance in which I have been reading with all the\r\n    faculties of mind and heart.\r\n\r\n    I like, at all times and in all moods, the kind of fiction that\r\n    gets closest to human life, and I value it in proportion as I\r\n    think it is likely to do the world some good. Thus (to cite\r\n    examples without method) I care very little for a book like\r\n    \"Vathek,\" and I loathe a book like \"Madame Bovary,\" because the\r\n    one is false to the real and the other is false to the ideal. I\r\n    see little imagination and much inexperience in \"Wuthering\r\n    Heights,\" and great scenic genius and profound ignorance of\r\n    human character in \"Notre Dame.\" In Gogol's little story of the\r\n    overcoat, and in Turgeneff's little story of the dumb porter I\r\n    find tenderness, humor, and true humanity. I miss essential\r\n    atmosphere in Godwin's masterpiece, and the best kind of\r\n    artistic conviction almost throughout Charles Reade. It makes\r\n    some deduction from my pleasure in Hawthorne that his best\r\n    characters stand too obviously not for human beings only, but\r\n    also for abstract ideas. I like George Eliot best in the first\r\n    part of \"Silas Marner,\" and least in the last part of \"The\r\n    Mill on the Floss.\" Perhaps I set the highest value on my\r\n    friend Blackmore among English novelists now living. I find\r\n    Tolstoï a great novelist in the sense in which his\r\n    fellow-countryman, Verestchagin, is a great painter--a great\r\n    delineator of various life, not a great creator. Björnson, the\r\n    Norwegian novelist, in his \"Arne\" seems to me a more\r\n    imaginative artist than Doré in his \"Vale of Tears.\" I do not\r\n    worship \"Manon Lescaut,\" and I would rather read \"Les\r\n    Miserables\" than \"Germinal.\" In short, to sum it up in a word,\r\n    I suppose I am an English idealist in the sense in which (if I\r\n    may say so without presumption) George Sand was a French\r\n    idealist. I think it is the best part of the business of art to\r\n    lighten the load of life. To do this by writing mere \"light\r\n    literature,\" the companion of an idle hour, a panacea for\r\n    toothache, a possible soporific, would seem to me so poor an\r\n    aim that, if it were the only thing before me I think I would\r\n    even yet look about for another profession. Fiction may lighten\r\n    life by sterner means--by showing the baffled man the meanness\r\n    of much success, and the unsuccessful man the truer triumphs of\r\n    failure. To break down the superstitions that separate class\r\n    from class, to show that the rule of the world is right, and\r\n    that though evil chance plays a part in life, yet that life is\r\n    worth living--these are among the functions of the novelist. In\r\n    reaching such ends there are few or no materials that I would\r\n    deny to him. He should be as free as the Elizabethan dramatists\r\n    were, or even the writers of our early ballads. His work would\r\n    be various in kind, and not all suited to all readers; but he\r\n    would touch no filth for the distinction of being defiled. It\r\n    would not trouble him a brass farthing whether his subject led\r\n    him to a \"good\" or a \"bad\" ending, for he would have a better\r\n    ambition than to earn the poor wages of a literary jester, and\r\n    his endings would always be good in the best sense where his\r\n    direction was good.\r\n\r\n    And so in some indirect way I have answered your question; and\r\n    I would like to add that I foresee that the dominion of the\r\n    novel must be extended. Fiction is now followed by appalling\r\n    numbers with amazing fecundity and marvellous skill, which,\r\n    though mainly imitative, is occasionally original; but its\r\n    channels are few and very narrow. Already the world seems to be\r\n    growing weary of feeble copies of feeble men and feeble\r\n    manners. It wants more grit, more aim, more thought, and more\r\n    imagination. But this is thin ice to tread, and I would not\r\n    disparage by a word or a wink the few novelists now living who\r\n    will assuredly rank with the best in literature. Dugald Stewart\r\n    said that human invention, like the barrel organ, was limited\r\n    to a specific number of tunes. The present hurdy-gurdy business\r\n    has been going on a longish time. We are threatened with the\r\n    Minerva press over again, and the class of readers who see no\r\n    difference between Walter Scott and John Galt. But, free of the\r\n    prudery of the tabernacle and the prurience of the boulevard,\r\n    surely the novel has a great future before it. Its\r\n    possibilities seem to me nearly illimitable. Though the best of\r\n    the novel is nowhere a match for the best of the drama, yet I\r\n    verily believe that if all English fiction, from Defoe\r\n    downwards, including names conspicuous and inconspicuous,\r\n    remembered and forgotten, were matched against all English\r\n    poetry of whatever kind, from Pope to our own day, it would be\r\n    found that the English novelist is far ahead of the English\r\n    poet in every great quality--imagination, pathos, humor,\r\n    largeness of conception, and general intellect. And I will not\r\n    hesitate to go further and say that, the art of the novel is\r\n    immeasurably greater than the art of the drama itself--more\r\n    natural as a vehicle and less limited in its uses, more various\r\n    in subject and less trammelled in its mechanism, capable of\r\n    everything that the drama (short of the stage) can do, and of\r\n    infinitely more resource.\r\n\r\n                    HALL CAINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _From Mr. Wilkie Collins._\r\n\r\nAfter pleading illness and arrears of literary work and correspondence\r\nin excuse of the brevity of his note, Mr. Collins says:\r\n\r\n    Besides, the expression of my opinion in regard to writers of\r\n    fiction and their works will lose nothing by being briefly\r\n    stated. After more than thirty years' study of the art, I\r\n    consider Walter Scott to be the greatest of all novelists, and\r\n    \"The Antiquary\" is, as I think, the most perfect of all\r\n    novels.\r\n\r\n                    WILKIE COLLINS.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _From Mr. H. Rider Haggard._\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR: I think that my favorite novel is Dickens's \"Tale of\r\n    Two Cities.\" I will not trouble you with all my reasons for\r\n    this preference. I may say, however, and I do so with\r\n    humility, and merely as an individual expression of opinion,\r\n    that it seems to me that in this great book Dickens touched\r\n    his highest level. Of course, the greatness of the subject has\r\n    something to do with the effect produced upon the mind, but in\r\n    my view there is a dignity and an earnestness in the work\r\n    which lift it above the rest. Also I think it one of the most\r\n    enthralling stories in the language.\r\n\r\n                    H. RIDER HAGGARD.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _From Mr. Joseph Hatton._\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR: You ask me to name my favorite novel, and if it\r\n    should happen to be a work by a foreign author to mention my\r\n    favorite English work of fiction also. I find it impossible to\r\n    answer you. When I was a boy \"The Last of the Mohicans\" was my\r\n    favorite novel; a young man and in love, \"David Copperfield\"\r\n    became my favorite. When I grew to be a man \"The Scarlet\r\n    Letter\" took the place of David and the North American Indian;\r\n    but ever since I can remember I have always been reading\r\n    \"Monte Cristo\" with unflagging delight. One's favorite book is\r\n    a question of mood. Now and then one might be inclined to\r\n    regard \"Adam Bede\" as the most companionable of fiction; there\r\n    are other times when \"Pickwick\" appeals most to one's fancy,\r\n    or when one is even in the humor for \"L'Homme qui Rit.\" \"Don\r\n    Quixote\" fits all moods, and there are moments when a page or\r\n    two of \"Clarissa\" are to one's taste. But with Scott,\r\n    Dickens, Thackeray, Hugo, Dumas, George Eliot, Hawthorne,\r\n    Smollett, Balzac, Erckmann-Chatrian, Lytton, Lever, Ik Marvel,\r\n    George Sand, Charles Reade, Turgeneff, and a host of other\r\n    famous writers of fiction staring me in the face, don't ask me\r\n    to say which of their works is my favorite novel.\r\n\r\n                    JOSEPH HATTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _From \"Vernon Lee.\"_\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR: I hasten to acknowledge your letter. I do not think,\r\n    however, that I can answer in a satisfactory manner. I am very\r\n    little of a novel reader, and do not feel that my opinion on\r\n    the subject of novels is therefore of critical value. Of the\r\n    few novels I know (comparing my reading with that of the\r\n    average Englishman or woman) I naturally prefer some; but to\r\n    give you the titles of them--I think I should place first\r\n    Tolstoï's \"War and Peace\" and Stendhal's \"Chartreuse de\r\n    Parme\"--would not be giving your readers any valuable\r\n    information, as I could not find leisure to explain _why_ I\r\n    prefer them.\r\n\r\n                    \"VERNON LEE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    _From Mr. George Moore._\r\n\r\n    SIR: Waiving the difficulty, if not the impossibility, of a\r\n    complete and satisfactory answer to your question, I will come\r\n    at once to the point. You ask me to name my favorite work of\r\n    fiction, giving reasons for the preference. The interest of\r\n    such a question will be found in the amount of naïve sincerity\r\n    with which it is answered. I will therefore strive to be as\r\n    naïvely sincere as possible.\r\n\r\n    Works of romance I must pass over, not because there are none\r\n    that I appreciate and enjoy, but because I feel that my\r\n    opinion of them would not be considered as interesting as my\r\n    opinion of a work depicting life within the limits of\r\n    practical life. The names of many works answering to this\r\n    description occur to me, but in spirit and form they are too\r\n    closely and intimately allied to my own work to allow me to\r\n    select any one of them as my favorite novel. Looking away from\r\n    them my thought fixes itself at once on Miss Austen. It\r\n    therefore only remains for me to choose that one which appears\r\n    to me to be the most characteristic of that lady's novels.\r\n    Unhesitatingly I say \"Emma.\"\r\n\r\n    The first words of praise I have for this matchless book is\r\n    the oneness of the result desired and the result attained.\r\n    Nature in producing a rose does not seem to work more\r\n    perfectly and securely than Miss Austen did. This merit, and\r\n    this merit I do not think any one will question, eternalizes\r\n    the book. \"L'Education Sentimentale,\" \"The Mill on the Floss,\"\r\n    \"Vanity Fair,\" \"Bleak House,\" I admire as much as any one; but\r\n    I can tell how the work is done; I can trace every trick of\r\n    workmanship. But analyse \"Emma\" as I will, I cannot tell how\r\n    the perfect, the incomparable result is achieved. There is no\r\n    story, there are no characters, there is no philosophy, there\r\n    is nothing: and yet it is a _chef-d'oeuvre_. I have said there\r\n    are no characters; this demands a word of explanation. Miss\r\n    Austen attempts only--and thereby she holds her unique\r\n    position--the conventionalities of life. She presents to us\r\n    man in his drawing-room skin: of the serpent that gnaws his\r\n    vitals she cares nothing, and apparently knows nothing. The\r\n    drawing-room skin is her sole aim. She never wavers. The\r\n    slightest hesitation would be fatal; her system is built on a\r\n    needle's point. We know that no such mild, virtuous people as\r\n    her's ever existed or could exist; the picture is incomplete,\r\n    but there lies the charm. The veil is wonderfully woven,\r\n    figures move beneath it never fully revealed, and we derive\r\n    pleasure from contemplating it because we recognize that it is\r\n    the sham hypocritical veil that we see but feel not--the sham\r\n    hypocritical world that we see is presented to us in all its\r\n    gloss without a scratch on its admirable veneer. No writer\r\n    except Jane Austen ever had the courage to so limit himself or\r\n    herself. The strength and the weakness of art lies in its\r\n    incompleteness, and no art was ever at once so complete and\r\n    incomplete as Miss Austen's.\r\n\r\n    Every great writer invents a pattern, and the Jane Austen\r\n    pattern is as perfect as it is inimitable. It stands alone.\r\n    The pattern is a very slight one, but so is that of the rarest\r\n    and most beautiful lace. And in all sincerity I say that I\r\n    would sooner sign myself the author of \"Emma\" than of any\r\n    novel in the English language--the novel I am now writing of\r\n    course excepted.\r\n\r\n                    GEORGE MOORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _From Mr. Justin McCarthy._\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR: I have so many favorites--even in English-written\r\n    fiction alone: I am very fond of good novels. I couldn't\r\n    select _one_. Let me give you a few, only a few! The moment I\r\n    have sent off this letter I shall be sure to repent some\r\n    omissions. Fielding's \"Joseph Andrews;\" Scott's \"Antiquary,\"\r\n    \"Guy Mannering,\" \"Heart of Midlothian,\" and \"St. Ronan's\r\n    Well;\" Dickens's \"Pickwick,\" \"Barnaby Rudge,\" and \"Tale of Two\r\n    Cities;\" Thackeray's \"Vanity Fair,\" \"Pendennis,\" and \"Esmond;\"\r\n    Charlotte Brontë's \"Jane Eyre;\" George Eliot's \"Mill on the\r\n    Floss;\" Hawthorne's \"Blithedale Romance;\" and George\r\n    Meredith's \"Beauchamp's Career.\"\r\n\r\n    And I had nearly forgotten in my haste two great favorites of\r\n    mine--Miss Austen's \"Pride and Prejudice,\" and Gerald\r\n    Griffin's \"Collegians;\" and, again, surely Hope's\r\n    \"Anastasius.\"\r\n\r\n    I had better stop.\r\n\r\n                    JUSTIN MCCARTHY.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _From Miss F. Mabel Robinson._\r\n\r\n    SIR: Your question is an extremely difficult one to answer.\r\n    One likes some novels for one kind of excellence, others for\r\n    another, and the favorite--the absolute favorite--is apt to\r\n    depend a little upon the good novel one has read most\r\n    recently, and a great deal more upon one's mood.\r\n\r\n    I do not think that I could name any one novel, either English\r\n    or foreign, as my first favorite; there are at least four of\r\n    Turgeneff's, the bare memory of which moves me almost to\r\n    tears; but I could not choose between \"Liza,\" \"Virgin Girl,\"\r\n    \"Fathers and Sons,\" and \"Smoke;\" and, of course, Tolstoï's\r\n    \"War and Peace\" is a masterpiece which every one will name as\r\n    a favorite (I give the titles in English, as I have read all\r\n    these in translations only, French or English), and indeed I\r\n    think I ought almost to name it as _the_ favorite among\r\n    foreign novels.\r\n\r\n    To turn to English masterpieces, there are parts of Fielding's\r\n    \"Amelia,\" which for tenderness, sweetness, and rendering of\r\n    character and of home life I think finer than anything more\r\n    modern; but other parts of the book are so unpleasant that I\r\n    cannot place it first. I think I must plead guilty to four\r\n    equal favorites: \"Amelia,\" \"Esmond,\" \"The Mill on the Floss,\"\r\n    and \"Villette;\" but perhaps I might tell you to-morrow that I\r\n    place \"Vanity Fair\" above \"Esmond,\" and prefer \"Middlemarch\"\r\n    to \"The Mill on the Floss.\" Still I think to-day's choice is\r\n    best, so I will stick to it.\r\n\r\n    It is impossible to know all one's reasons for preferring some\r\n    books to others--the style, the diction, the subtle way in\r\n    which the writer makes you feel many things he has left unsaid\r\n    elude description; and one's own frame of mind when the book\r\n    first became known may have a great deal to do with it.\r\n    Unconsciously association has much to do with one's\r\n    preferences. It is for the character of Amelia, and the charm\r\n    of her relations with her husband, that I like this novel.\r\n    Some of the scenes and dialogues between these two are to my\r\n    mind perfect, absolutely true and beautiful and satisfying.\r\n    \"Esmond\" is certainly very inferior to \"Amelia\" in point of\r\n    illusion; one always is conscious that one is _reading_, and\r\n    the characters are like people we have heard of, or who are at\r\n    least absent from us; but Harry Esmond is, to my mind, the\r\n    finest gentleman in English fiction, none the less noble for\r\n    his little self-conscious air. I have always wondered why he\r\n    is less popular than Col. Newcome. Except perhaps Warrington\r\n    he is Thackeray's noblest male character; and \"Esmond\" is, I\r\n    take it, the best constructed of Thackeray's novels, and\r\n    exquisitely written. It is only because there is no woman\r\n    worthy of the name of heroine that I cannot like this novel\r\n    best of all. For the reverse reason, that there is no hero, I\r\n    cannot place \"The Mill on the Floss\" quite first. Maggie is a\r\n    beautiful creation, and the picture of English country-life\r\n    inimitable; the Dodsen family in all its branches is truly\r\n    masterly. But for deep insight into the heart and soul and\r\n    mind of a woman where will you find Charlotte Brontë's equal?\r\n    Her descriptive power and her style are unsurpassable, and\r\n    Lucy Snowe can teach you more about the thoughts and griefs\r\n    and unaccountable nervous miseries and heart-aches of the\r\n    average young woman than any other heroine in fiction that I\r\n    know of. There is no episode that I am aware of, of such\r\n    heartfelt truth as that wretched summer holiday she passed\r\n    alone at Madame Beck's. And every character in the book is\r\n    excellent; and as for the manner of it, it seems wrung from\r\n    the very heart of the writer.\r\n\r\n                    F. MABEL ROBINSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _From Mr. W. Clark Russell._\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR: I hardly know what to say in response to your\r\n    question as to my favorite work of fiction. I am afraid I must\r\n    go so far back as Defoe, of whose \"Colonel Jack\" and \"Moll\r\n    Flanders\" I never weary. Amongst modern writers I greatly\r\n    admire Blackmore, Hardy, and Besant. There is great genius and\r\n    originality, too, in Christie Murray. But with Thackeray,\r\n    Dickens, George Eliot, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Mrs. Gaskell, and\r\n    the Brontë's on my shelves, the indication of any one work of\r\n    fiction as my favorite since the days of \"Roxana,\" \"Pamela,\"\r\n    \"Joseph Andrews,\" and \"Humphrey Clinker,\" would prove an\r\n    undertaking which I fear I have not the courage to adventure.\r\n\r\n                    W. CLARK RUSSELL.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _From Mr. J. Henry Shorthouse._\r\n\r\n    SIR: Your question seems to me to be a difficult, or I might\r\n    almost say, an impossible one to answer. I do not see how a\r\n    man of any carefulness of thought or decision can have one\r\n    favorite work of fiction. To answer your question as simply as\r\n    possible, I should say that of foreign books my favorites are\r\n    \"Don Quixote\" and the novels of Goethe and Jean Paul Richter.\r\n\r\n    As regards English fiction, I should, I think, place George\r\n    Eliot's \"Silas Marner\" first, both as a work of art and as\r\n    fulfilling, to me, all the needs and requirements of a work of\r\n    fiction; but I could not say this unless I may be allowed to\r\n    bracket with this book Nathaniel Hawthorne's \"House of the\r\n    Seven Gables,\" Mrs. Gaskell's \"Cranford,\" Jane Austen's\r\n    \"Persuasion,\" Mrs. Ritchie's \"Story of Elizabeth,\" and William\r\n    Black's \"Daughter of Heth\"--all of which books seem to me to\r\n    stand in the very first rank, and not only to fulfil the\r\n    requirements of the human spirit, but to stand the much more\r\n    difficult test of being, each of them, perfect as a whole.\r\n\r\n                    J. HENRY SHORTHOUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _From Mr. W. Westall._\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR: You ask for the title of my favorite work of\r\n    fiction. I answer that I have no one favorite work of fiction.\r\n    Among the myriad novels which I have read there is none of\r\n    excellence so supreme that I prefer it before all others. On\r\n    the other hand, I have favorite novels--a dozen or so; I have\r\n    never reckoned them up. These I will enumerate as they occur\r\n    to me: \"Don Quixote,\" \"Tom Jones,\" \"Ivanhoe,\" \"The Heart of\r\n    Midlothian,\" \"Jane Eyre,\" \"David Copperfield,\" \"Tale of Two\r\n    Cities,\" \"Esmond,\" \"Vanity Fair,\" \"Adam Bede,\" \"Lorna Doone,\"\r\n    \"Crime and Punishment\" (Dostoieffsky), \"Monte Cristo,\" and\r\n    \"Froment Jeune et Risler Ainé.\"\r\n\r\n    I do not suggest that these novels are of equal literary\r\n    merit. I merely say that they are my favorites, that I have\r\n    read them all with equal pleasure more than once, and that, as\r\n    time goes on, I hope to read them again.\r\n\r\n                    W. WESTALL.\r\n\r\n                                        J. A.

B. PIATT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE COST OF THINGS._\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Papa, why does bread cost so much money?\" asks a child, of its\r\nfather. Perhaps if the father is indifferent, indolent, or ignorant,\r\nhe may dodge the question and reply, \"Because flour is so scarce.\" But\r\nif he is a thinking and observant man, willing to instruct an ignorant\r\nchild asking a very natural question, he will not content himself with\r\nsuch a reply, for he must have observed that bread is sometimes high\r\nwhen wheat and flour are very plentiful.\r\n\r\nBy drawing on his experience he will not fail to recall the fact that,\r\nin a season when any particular article is in much demand, the price\r\nof that article will rise and will continue to rise until the demand\r\nfor the article induces a supply of it from outside sources.\r\n\r\nLet him recall Christmas and Thanksgiving times, when, for instance,\r\nturkeys are in demand. If the supply is light, up goes the price of\r\nturkeys; and, if the demand increases, the price will continue to rise\r\nunless some means are found of supplying the demand. If turkeys flow\r\ninto the market of a city from the surrounding country, the rise in\r\nprice is first checked, and then, as the supply increases, the price\r\nfalls, and the demand being less than the supply, the price goes to\r\nits lowest figure. This is in accordance with the recognized law of\r\nsupply and demand, the relation between the two always establishing\r\nthe price.\r\n\r\nIf the demand is greater than the supply, the price will go up; if the\r\nsupply is greater than the demand, the price will go down. But this\r\nstate of things can exist only where the inflow of supply and the\r\noutflow of demand are _free_ and _unrestricted_; for if, from any\r\ncause, restriction is placed on the inflow, the outflow will be\r\nrestricted just in the same way. We may liken the operation of the law\r\nto what happens when a bent tube with the ends up is filled with\r\nwater. If, now, more water is poured in at one end, that same amount\r\nwill flow out at the other. If the whole capacity of the tube at one\r\nend is used to supply water, just that amount will run out at the\r\nother; but if one-half the tube at the supply end is plugged up, then\r\nonly one-half the capacity of the tube will run out at the other.\r\n\r\nReverting to the question of the supply of turkeys in a market, let\r\nus suppose that a despot, ungoverned by anything but his own will, is\r\nin charge of the city when the turkey market is held, and of the\r\nsurrounding country, and, wishing to have a plentiful supply of\r\nturkeys, he issues his ukase that every turkey within ten miles of the\r\ntown shall, under severe penalties, be sent into market for sale. Is\r\nit not plain that the price of turkeys will at once fall, since the\r\nsupply will at once become greater than the demand? But suppose this\r\ndespot has turkeys of his own to sell, and hence desires to make his\r\npoor people pay the highest price for their turkeys, so that his\r\ncoffers may be filled with gold. Now, instead of requiring all turkeys\r\nto come in under severe penalties, he does everything he can to keep\r\nthem out, and issues his ukase that none shall come in, under penalty\r\nof death to the importer of turkeys. Is it not as plain as it was in\r\nthe other case, that the price of turkeys will go up, up, up, until\r\nthe vast majority of men cannot buy at all?\r\n\r\nSuppose that, instead of placing an absolute prohibition upon the\r\nimportation of turkeys, the despot, convinced that people must have\r\nturkeys, and having already arranged to buy all he wants himself,\r\nmakes a law that every turkey coming into the market shall be taxed\r\none dollar for the privilege of bringing it to market. Now, turkeys\r\nwill come in if there is still a demand for them, but every one that\r\ncomes in must pay a tax of a dollar; and, if there are any turkeys\r\nalready in market, a dollar will be added to their price, as well as\r\nto the price of those coming in. For no importer proposes to lose the\r\namount of the tax himself, and is bound to make the consumer pay that\r\nmuch additional for his turkey; and a resident turkey-dealer, seeing\r\nthat imported turkeys are selling for a dollar above the market price,\r\nwill at once add that to the price of his turkeys, since it is\r\nexpecting too much of human nature to suppose any man is going to sell\r\nhis property for less than he can get for it. The result of the\r\ndespot's tax, therefore, is to raise the local price of turkeys by\r\njust the amount of that tax; and, the higher the tax, the higher the\r\nprice of turkeys will be to the consumer.\r\n\r\nIn this way the price of any article in a market is established by the\r\nrelation between the supply and the demand; and this law is\r\ninexorable. If the supply is restricted by taxing imports, the price,\r\nwhilst higher, will still be fixed by the demand made for the article;\r\nand this applies to all articles which are salable--flesh and blood,\r\nmuscle, labor, as well as to bread, meat, etc. In slavery times, when\r\na great demand existed in the cotton-States for slave labor, slaves\r\nwere imported from the more northern States, where labor was not so\r\nvaluable, to the more southern ones, where it was more so; and this\r\ngave the border States the name of being the \"slave-breeding States\"\r\nof the Union. The increased demand for slaves threatened at one time\r\nto reopen the slave trade with Africa; and it is said that some\r\nnegroes were, in fact, brought into the country. Under these\r\ncircumstances, had the States (Mississippi, Louisiana, and others)\r\nwhere a demand for slaves existed possessed the power to lay a tax on\r\nslaves imported into them, the price of slaves in those States would\r\nhave been very considerably increased.\r\n\r\nThe work of hands--labor--is a salable article, just as much as bread\r\nor meat, and its price is determined in the same way; not only as\r\nregards common labor, but also special kinds of labor. Reverting to\r\nthe question at the head of this paper,--the price of bread,--let us\r\nsuppose a community where all the elements of bread-making (flour,\r\nyeast, potatoes, etc.) exist in abundance, but where there is but one\r\nbaker. If the demand for bread is so great that one baker will have to\r\nrun his bakery night and day to supply the demand, and he can fix his\r\nown price, limited only by the number of his customers and their\r\nability to pay (the \"demand\"), although he can buy his flour and other\r\ningredients cheap, he must pay high wages to his assistants and work\r\nhard himself. As the demand for bread increases, its prices will rise\r\nuntil the attention of other bakers is attracted, other bakeries will\r\nbe established, the supply will more nearly equal the demand, and the\r\nprice of bread will fall, in accordance with the same law as governed\r\nin the case of turkeys; whilst bakers' wages, from the very fact of\r\nthere being more bakers on the ground, will fall. If, notwithstanding\r\nthe establishment of more bakeries, the demand still remains greater\r\nthan the supply, the price of bread will still remain up, and an\r\nattempt may be made to import bread from without. If the bakers have\r\ninfluence enough with the law-making power, or with our supposed\r\ndespot, they will have an import tax placed upon bread to keep up\r\ntheir prices, under the plea of \"sustaining domestic industry;\" but\r\nthe amount of this import tax will go into the pockets of the owners\r\nof the bakeries, although the wages of their workmen will not be\r\nincreased, for their wages depend, as has been shown, not on the price\r\nof bread, but upon the number of bread-making laborers available. If\r\nsuch laborers increase in number, the wages of the bread-makers may\r\neven go very low, though the price of bread (thanks to the import tax)\r\nmay remain very high. These points are dwelt upon at length for the\r\npurpose of exposing the fallacy of a popular delusion--that....\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable fact that, whilst many laboring-men are deluded\r\nwith the idea that taxing articles which they consume or aid in\r\nproducing tends to keep up their wages or to increase them, they\r\nentirely ignore the real reason for low wages, which is nothing more\r\nor less than the presence of plenty of labor. Once convinced of the\r\nfact that the price of everything, labor included, depends on the\r\ninexorable law of supply and demand, they will not be able to resist\r\nthe conclusion that _no importation tax can, by any possibility,\r\naffect the price of labor, except an importation tax on labor itself_.\r\n\r\nThis fact seems almost to demonstrate itself; and yet there is no\r\ngreater delusion in this country, where its falsity is demonstrated\r\nevery day to anyone observant of the settlement of our vast Western\r\nterritories. Let anyone go into a Western settlement and note the high\r\nprice of labor of all kinds, and that it is almost impossible to get a\r\nman to do a day's work for love or money; and let him visit the same\r\nplace a few years later, when perhaps a railroad is running through\r\nthe place, which in the meantime has grown immensely in population. He\r\nwill now note the decrease in wages of all kinds. And, if he will go\r\nto the same place still later, he will not fail to note a still\r\nfurther decline; for, if the demand continues, labor will, by means of\r\nthe railroad, flow in to supply it, and the price of labor will\r\nfall--for no other reason than that there is plenty of labor to supply\r\nthe demand. And this lesson is demonstrated over and over again\r\nwherever a new settlement is observed. If there is only one bricklayer\r\nin the place he can demand his own price, which cannot be affected by\r\nthe presence of fifty or a hundred carpenters or blacksmiths, nor by a\r\ntax on bricks, mortar, or sand.\r\n\r\n                                        X.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_ASLEEP._\r\n\r\n\r\n    She is not dead, but sleepeth. As the fair,\r\n        Sweet queen, dear Summer, laid her sceptre down\r\n        And lifted from her tirèd brows her crown,\r\n    And now lies lapped in slumber otherwhere--\r\n    As she will rise again, when smiling May,\r\n        Saying, \"Thy day dawns,\" wakes her with a kiss,\r\n        And butterflies break from the chrysalis\r\n    And throng to welcome her upon her way,\r\n        And roses laugh out into bloom for glee\r\n        That Summer is awake again--so she\r\n    Who sleeps, snow-still and white, will waken when\r\n    The Day dawns--and will live for us again.\r\n\r\n                                        CHARLES PRESCOTT SHERMON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A COUPLE OF VAGABONDS._\r\n\r\n\r\nVagabonds, vagrants, tramps,--the class has never been entirely\r\nconfined to humanity,--those careless, happy-go-easy, dishonest,\r\nunterrified beings to whom the world is an oyster, and often such a\r\none as is not worth the opening, sometimes possess an interest to the\r\nobserver, entirely disconnected with pity. They always lead\r\nreprehensible lives, and usually die disgracefully. They are amusing\r\nbecause of the exaggerated obliquity of their careers, and are, beasts\r\nand men alike, droll with a drollery that is three-quarters original\r\nsin. Among animals, at least, there are few cases of actual\r\nmisfortune, though sometimes there is that most pitiable and forlorn\r\ncreature, a dog that has lost his master, or that bit of cruelty and\r\ncrime which has its exemplification in an old horse that has been\r\nturned out to die. Ordinarily the cases of animal depravity one\r\nencounters are so by race and ineradicable family habit, and are\r\nbeyond the pale of charity and outside the legitimate field of\r\nbrotherly love. One does not care what becomes of them, and least of\r\nall thinks of trying to reform them. But they usually take care of\r\nthemselves, after a fashion that excludes all thought of pity. Even\r\namong the higher animals there are, as with humanity, occasional cases\r\nof extraordinary depravity. I know at this moment of a beautiful\r\nhorse, with a white hind foot, and the blood of a long line of\r\naristocrats in his veins, who wears an iron muzzle and two\r\nhalter-chains, whose stall is the cell of a demon, who has made his\r\nteeth meet in the flesh of two or three of his keepers, and who is yet\r\nsufficiently sane to try to beat all his competitors on the track, and\r\nto often succeed. I know a little gray family dog, terrier from the\r\nend of his nose to the tip of his tail, kind to all whom he knows, who\r\nis yet the veriest crank of his kind. He hates everything that wears\r\ntrousers, will not come when called with the kindest intentions,\r\nattacks all other dogs, big and little, who intrude within his line of\r\nvision, and confines his friendships exclusively to people who wear\r\nskirts and bonnets. He wears his heavy coat all summer because he has\r\nsaid to the family collectively that he will not be clipped; and, when\r\nan attempt of that kind is made, shows his teeth, even to the little\r\ngirl who owns him. He reminds one of the incorrigible youth of an\r\notherwise God-fearing family, and has been let go in his ways because\r\nhe is too ugly and plucky to spend the time upon. I know a cat, now\r\nnot more than half-grown, with a handsome ash-colored coat and a\r\nlittle white neck-tie, who is already as much a tiger as though born\r\nin the wilds of Africa. His playful bites draw blood, and his\r\nunsheathed claws are a terror, even when one is stroking his back. His\r\ntail quivers and his eyes have a tigerish expression, even when he is\r\nbut catching a ball of yarn. He was after mice, and caught them, in\r\nhis early infancy, and he was crouching and skulking after things when\r\nhe should have been lapping milk. It is plainly foreseen that he will\r\nnever be a family cat, and will take to the alleys and back fences\r\nbefore he is grown. He has in him, more than other cats have, the\r\nvagabond and depraved instinct--not amenable to Christian influences.\r\n\r\nBut the two persons of whom I shall doubtless seem to have as full\r\nrecollection here as their characters justify belong to the extensive\r\nfamily of natural vagabonds, and first dawned upon me in the days when\r\nthere was a frontier. I was in those days perfectly hardened to a bed\r\non the ground, and was amused with the companionship of pack-mules. I\r\nwas dependent for mental stimulus upon the stories of the camp-fire,\r\nand for recreation upon the wild realm in which the only changes that\r\ncould come were sunrise and evening, clouds, wind, storms. There was a\r\nlonely vastness so wide that it became second nature to live in it and\r\nalmost to love it, and a silence so dense that it became\r\ncompanionship. There was then no dream of anything that was to come.\r\nThe march of empire had not touched the uttermost boundary. We\r\nwondered why we were there. And the blindest of all the people about\r\nthis wonderful empire were those who knew it best. I really expected\r\nthen to watch and chase Indians for the remainder of my natural life;\r\nlooked upon them and their congeners as permanent institutions; made\r\nit a part of business to know them as well as possible; and wondered\r\nall the while at the uselessness of the government policy in\r\noccupying, even with a few soldiers, so hopeless a territory. Very\r\noften there was nothing else to do. All the books had been committed\r\nto memory previous to being absolutely worn out. It was a world where\r\nnewspapers never came. When the friendship of certain animals becomes\r\nobtrusive,--when they take the place to you of those outsiders whom\r\nyou do not really wish to know, but who are there nevertheless,--you\r\nare likely to come to understand them very well indeed, and to find in\r\nafter years that they seem to come under the head of persons rather\r\nthan creatures--the casual wild creatures of whom one ordinarily\r\ncatches a glimpse or two in the course of a lifetime.\r\n\r\nThere was a bushy and exalted tail often seen moving leisurely along\r\nabove the taller grasses that lined the prairie trail. One might\r\nencounter it at any hour, or might not see it for many days. I finally\r\ncame to look upon this plume with something more than the interest\r\nattaching to a mere vagrant polecat, and even ceased to regard the end\r\nthat bore it as the one specially to be avoided, however common the\r\nimpression that it is so. In civilization and in the books nobody had\r\never accused the parti-colored creature of other than a very odorous\r\nreputation; and the tricks of his sly life--such as rearing an\r\ninteresting and deceptively pretty family under the farmer's\r\ncorn-crib, and refusing to be ejected thence; visiting, with fowl\r\nintent, the hen-house; sucking eggs; catching young ducks; and forcing\r\nthe pedestrian to go far around him upon the occasion of a chance\r\nmeeting, were condoned as matters that could not be helped in the then\r\ncondition of human ingenuity and invention. With us, on the plains, he\r\nhad acquired another and more terrible reputation. Nobody knows how\r\ninformation becomes disseminated in the wilderness, but it seemed to\r\nbe spread with a rapidity usually only known in a village of some\r\nthree hundred inhabitants, with a Dorcas Society; and we came to know,\r\nfrom authentic instances, that his bite, and not his perfume, was\r\ndangerous. In 1873, the _Medical Herald_, printed at the metropolis of\r\nLeavenworth, stated that a young man sleeping in a plains camp was\r\nbitten on the nose by one of the beasts. Awaking, he flung his\r\nmidnight visitor off, and it immediately bit his companion, upon whom\r\nit unfortunately alighted. Both of these unfortunates died of\r\nhydrophobia.\r\n\r\nThe same year a citizen came to the U. S. Army surgeon at Fort Harker,\r\nKansas, having been bitten through the nose by a mephitis while\r\nasleep. He had symptoms of hydrophobia, and shortly afterwards died of\r\nthat disease. The next case of which printed record was made was that\r\nof a young man who, while sleeping on the ground, was bitten through\r\nthe thumb. The writer states that the \"animal had to be killed before\r\nthe thumb could be extracted.\" This man also died of hydrophobia in\r\nthe town of Russell, in western Kansas. Other cases are recorded about\r\nthis time, with less detail.\r\n\r\nI mention these instances, substantiated in cold print in a medical\r\njournal, merely to show that what we thought we knew was not a mere\r\nfrontier superstition. With a righteous hatred did we hate the whole\r\nmephitis family. The little prairie rattlesnake often crept into the\r\nblankets at night for the sake of warmth; and it is a noticeable fact\r\nthat he did not \"rattle\" and did not bite anybody while enjoying their\r\nunintended hospitality, and that such things were not much thought of.\r\nBut the sneaking presence of a skunk, usually considered merely a\r\nridiculous and disagreeable creature, would always call out the force\r\nfor his extermination, promptly, and by some means.\r\n\r\nYet mephitis has the air of seeming rather to like, than to seek to\r\navoid, mankind. It is one of his curious traits. You cannot certainly\r\ntell whether he really does; but, if he does not, it is strange with\r\nwhat frequency he is encountered, exhibiting on such occasions a\r\nsingular confidence, not in any case reciprocated. It is certain that\r\nhe has crossed a railroad bridge to visit the bustling metropolis of\r\nthe Missouri Valley, and been seen complacently ambling the streets\r\nthere at midnight. If, in crossing a \"divide\" or threading a reedy\r\ncreek-bottom, there is seen before you one of those imposing plumes\r\nbefore referred to, standing erect above the long grass, without any\r\nperceptible attachment, and moving slowly along, it will be prudent\r\nnot to permit any curiosity concerning the bearer of it to tempt you\r\nto a nearer acquaintance. Indeed, should he discover you, in turn, it\r\nwill be rather out of the usual line of his conduct if he does not at\r\nonce come amiably ambling in your direction, intent upon making your\r\npersonal acquaintance, or, as is more likely, of finding out if there\r\nis anything about you which he considers good to eat. There is\r\nsomething both amusing and fearful in this desire to make\r\nacquaintances regardless of all the forms of introduction and the\r\nusages of society; and no other animal possesses the trait. No one, so\r\nfar as known, has ever waited to see what special line of conduct he\r\nwould pursue after he came. The chances are that he would stay as long\r\nas he had leisure, and then go without offence; yet no one can\r\nforetell his possible caprices. He might conclude to spend the\r\nafternoon with one; and, as he is known to be a pivotal animal,\r\nreversing himself, upon suspicion arising in his mind, with a celerity\r\nperhaps not fully appreciated until afterwards, one might find it at\r\nleast irksome to remain so long idle and quite still. I knew a soldier\r\nonce who had such a visit while walking his guard-beat. He did not\r\ndare to fire his gun in time, for fear of the serious accusation of\r\nwishing to kill game while on duty. He could not scare away the cat,\r\nand dared not leave his beat. He stood stock-still for an hour or two,\r\nand then called the corporal of the guard in a subdued and whining\r\nvoice. When that non-commissioned autocrat at last appeared, he\r\nconsidered twenty yards a convenient distance for communication, and\r\ndeclined to come any nearer. Mephitis was at the moment engaged in\r\nstroking his sides against the sentinel's trousers, while his host did\r\nnot dare to either move or speak in a voice the corporal could hear.\r\nThe latter went away and obtained permission from the officer of the\r\nday to shoot something, and returned with four more armed men. The\r\nvisitor here saw an opportunity to make new acquaintances, and started\r\nto meet the latest arrivals half way. They all ran, while the sentinel\r\ntook the opportunity to walk off in a direction not included in his\r\ninstructions. The animal was finally partially killed by a volley at\r\nforty paces, leaving a pungent reminiscence that did not depart during\r\nthe remainder of the summer, and necessitated some new arrangements\r\nfor the lines of defence about the post.\r\n\r\nIn more recent times an entire company of hunters, with a dog to every\r\nman, have been driven from the field repeatedly by the persistency of\r\nthe innocent gaze, or the foolish confidence of the approach, of this\r\nextraordinary bore; for one can't shoot him if he is looking--not\r\nbecause one can't, but because, if one did, a souvenir would be left,\r\nat least among the dogs, that would linger with them until the natural\r\ntime for the shedding of hair should come again, and deprive their\r\nowners of the pleasure of their company for an indefinite period. And,\r\nin addition, the people with whom one might wish to stop for the night\r\nmight make remarks accompanied by nasal contortions not usual in\r\nordinary conversation, and would be likely to suggest the barn, or\r\notherwheres out-of-doors, as being good and refreshing places to spend\r\nthe night in. Even the hunter's own family will prove inhospitable to\r\nthe verge of cruelty under such circumstances, and conduct unheard of\r\nbefore will become perfectly proper on the part of one's best friends.\r\nSuch discomfitures have happened ere now to most sportsmen in Western\r\npreserves, and for some reason a crowning misfortune of the kind is\r\napt to be considered a joke ever afterwards.\r\n\r\nBut an uncontrollable desire for human intimacy is only one item of\r\nthe oddities of this little beast. As a vagabond of the wilderness he\r\nwas like other vagabonds there, and got on well enough without any\r\nhuman association. Carnivorous entirely, he cannot be accused of\r\nlooking for the well-filled granary of later times; he invades no\r\ncabbage-patch, and is entirely guiltless of succulent sweet potatoes\r\nand milky roasting-ears. His presence in increased numbers among the\r\nfields and farms of civilization is accounted for by the fact that he\r\nhas simply declined to move on. He will not retire to the wilds of\r\nthe pan-handle or the neutral strip, driven thither by the too copious\r\noutpour of civilization. His conduct indicates the just conclusion\r\nthat he can endure all the vicissitudes of the school-house States if\r\nthey can, in turn, endure him. Doubly armed, this autocrat of the\r\nprairies holds in unique dignity the quality of absolute fearlessness,\r\nand, aside from any hydrophobic endowments, is now the chiefest terror\r\nof the free and boundless West.\r\n\r\nA figure-head seems to be necessary in the conduct of all the larger\r\naffairs of life. From this idea have come all the griffins, and the\r\nsphinxes, and the St. Georges and Dragons, the hideous caryatids,\r\ngnomes, gorgons, chimeras dire, the eyes of Chinese junks, and the\r\nwooden cherubs that until later years looked over the waste of unknown\r\nwaters beneath the bows of every ship that sailed. On the seals of\r\none-half of all the Western States and territories mephitis might\r\nfigure as the chiefest animal of their natural fauna, and for him\r\nmight the buffalo and the bear be properly discarded. They are gone:\r\nhe remains and impresses himself upon the community unmistakably. But\r\nmottoes and great seals and epitaphs are things not expected to be\r\ngoverned in their making by anything like actual fact.\r\n\r\nIt will be conceded that no other beast approaches this in the\r\nparticulars of his armament. So confident of his resources is he that\r\nthe idea that he can be worsted never enters his elongated cranium.\r\nThough he never uses his phenomenal powers except upon what he\r\nconsiders an emergency, these supposed emergencies arise quite too\r\nfrequently for the general comfort and piety of his neighborhood. It\r\nis said that the little western church never thrives greatly in a\r\nneighborhood that is for some reason peculiarly infested by him. Yet\r\nit is a remarkable fact that when he visits the farmer's hen-roost,\r\nwhich he often does, the owner, if he came from some timbered country,\r\nnearly always lays the blame upon the much-maligned \"coon;\" meaning,\r\nof course, that pad-footed and ring-tailed creature who is credited\r\nwith a slyness verging upon intellect, but who never visited a prairie\r\nin his life. He does this because there is no penetrating and abiding\r\nsavor left behind--except in case of accident--in any of these\r\nmaraudings. It is a mere piece of cunning. He wishes to come again\r\nsome other time. The victims of his appetite, comprising everything\r\nsmaller than himself in that region, are never subjected to his caudal\r\nessences, and a good reason for this would be that he wishes to eat\r\nthem himself. Those who know mephitis well, and also know this trait\r\nof his character, are impressed anew by the mercifulness of some of\r\nnature's instincts and freaks.\r\n\r\nAnd here arises the question of a certain occult power apparently\r\npossessed by this creature alone. It seems to be established by\r\nundisputed testimony that he is the most skilful packer of meats, with\r\nthe least trouble and expense, known in the annals of the art\r\npreservative. His hollow logs have been repeatedly split in his\r\nabsence, and found full of dead fowls, killed in a neighboring\r\nfarm-yard, squeezed in closely side by side for future use, and all\r\nuntainted and fresh. How does he accomplish this? There are evidently\r\nvarious things to learn from the field of natural history which might\r\nbe turned to the uses of man. To say nothing of the value of the\r\npatent, this would be a very useful household recipe if known. The\r\ninference is that there may be an occult quality in his strange and\r\ncharacteristic endowment not heretofore suspected.\r\n\r\nOur western friend has an extensive family relationship. There are at\r\nleast six varieties of him in various latitudes. No one branch of the\r\nfamily is believed to have any fellowship with any other branch,\r\nprobably for weighty and sufficient family reasons; though to the\r\nordinary human senses there is so little difference in the sachet that\r\none cannot see reason for being so particular among themselves. Two of\r\nhim are very common west of the Missouri--one as big as a poodle and\r\nvariously striped, and the other of a smaller and more concentrated\r\nvariety, more active also in his habits. It is the bigger of these two\r\nwho goes about waving his plume and seeking new acquaintances, as\r\nthough he contemplated going into the Bohemian oats business among the\r\nfarmers, and who courts admiration while he spreads consternation. It\r\nis he who lies in ambush in the corn-shocks, in the early days of the\r\nyellow autumn, apparently for the express purpose, through the media\r\nof the farmer's boys and the district school, of informing the whole\r\nneighborhood, and especially the little girls, that he is still about.\r\nIt is he who is borne oftenest, in spirit and essence, through the\r\nopen windows of the settler's house, causing the mistress thereof to\r\nwish, and to often say that she wishes, that she had never come away\r\nfrom Ohio, or wherever she used to reside, and where she declares\r\nmephitis to have been a nuisance utterly unknown. It is he who lopes\r\ninnocently along the railroad track, declining to retire, meeting\r\ndeath without a murmur, knowing, perhaps, that his dire revenge will\r\nfollow the fleeting train, whose wheels have murdered him, for many a\r\nmile, even across the plains and into mountain passes, and perhaps\r\nreturn with it and add a little something, a piquant mite, to the loud\r\nodors of the Missouri River terminus. The passengers all know he has\r\nbeen killed, and know it for the remainder of the journey, or else\r\nthey wonder at the pungency of the atmosphere apparently pervading a\r\nstretch of country as big as all New England, and which they will talk\r\nabout as one of the western drawbacks after they have returned home.\r\nIt is he who rather rejoices than otherwise at the number and ferocity\r\nof the farmer's dogs, and who is indirectly blessed if they have the\r\nhabit of going into the house and lying under the beds. Then indeed\r\nmay he fulfil his mission. When they at first, and through\r\ninexperience, attack him, he routs them all without excitement or\r\nanger on his part, causes an armed domestic investigation of them, and\r\ntheir banishment without extradition, and through them impresses\r\nhimself upon the unappreciative western understanding.\r\n\r\nThe little one, the other common variety, is perhaps more rarely seen,\r\nbut he is at least frequently suspected. Not much bigger than a\r\nkitten, and almost or quite black, he lacks the look of innocence and\r\nthe appearance of docility so falsely worn by his relative. Once they\r\nboth hibernated: at least the books say so. Now, as one of the changes\r\nwrought by the settlement of the country, this small one becomes a\r\nfrequent all-the-year tenant of the farmer's out-buildings. His\r\nbattery is quite as formidable as the other's is, and may, indeed, be\r\nconsidered as an improvement in the way of rapidity and concentration,\r\nlike the Gatling gun. The barn is not always his residence; and\r\nwithout inquiring if it is entirely convenient he frequently takes up\r\nhis domicile in or under the dwelling. A mephitis in the cellar is one\r\nof the Kansas things. He does not, while there, produce any of the\r\nmysterious noises that indicate ghosts. The house is known not to be\r\nhaunted, for everybody understands quite well who is there. But the\r\nowner must not attempt ejectment. Peace and quiet he insists upon. You\r\nmust bar him out some time when he is absent on business, wait until\r\nspring, or move to another house. It is the middle one of these\r\nremedies that is usually adopted, if any. While he stays, there are no\r\njoint occupants with him in the place he has pre-empted. He will catch\r\nmice like a cat, and the joy of his life is the breaking of a rat's\r\nback with one nip behind the head. He has a most formidable array of\r\nteeth, and eschews vegetables entirely. He is the foe of all the\r\nlittle animals who live in walls or basements, or in holes or under\r\nstones. Even the weazel, that slim incarnation of predatory instinct,\r\ndeclines to enter into competition with him, and goes when he comes,\r\nor comes when the other goes. One of them is suspected, from this\r\nfact, of eating the other, and mankind, with the only form of\r\ndisinterestedness of which we can justly boast, does not care which of\r\nthe two it is.\r\n\r\nThe biggest one of the mephitis family lives in Texas, and that empire\r\nis not disposed to boast itself withal on that account. He came there\r\nfrom Mexico, possibly on account of his being preposterously\r\nconsidered a table luxury in the latter country. But it is a land of\r\nwhich such eccentricities may be expected. They eat the ground-lizard\r\nthere,--a variety of the celebrated \"Gila monster,\"--and some other\r\ncreatures to our pampered notions not less repulsive; though they seem\r\nto avoid, by peculiar management, that quadrennial banquet of crow\r\nwhich constitutes our great national dish. Mephitis is, however,\r\npurely American wherever he comes from. Europe knows him not in\r\nquadrupedal form. He is one of the things got by discovery, though he\r\nmay not take rank, perhaps, with the gigantic grass we call \"corn,\" or\r\nwith tobacco, or even with ginseng or sassafras, or the host of\r\nacquisitions which would distinguish us as a people even if we had him\r\nnot at all. And now that we have got him, we must apparently cherish\r\nhim; and with our usual thrift we have made many attempts to utilize\r\nhim. He often appears in polite society under the name of sable, or\r\nsome such thing, and no odor betrays him. Of the strange fluid, which\r\nis one of the most wonderful natural defences ever bestowed upon an\r\nanimal, pharmacy has concocted a medicine, and the perfumers an odor\r\nfor the toilet. Yet it must be admitted that one of his chiefest uses,\r\nso far, is to furnish the western editor with a synonym and\r\ncomparative, and a telling epithet in time of trouble. He often caps\r\nthe climax of a controversial sentence as long as one's arm, and if\r\nyou take the county paper you need not be long in discovering that\r\nwhile we scientific may call him _mephitis_, he hath another name not\r\noften heard by ears polite, or frequently mentioned in the society in\r\nwhich the reader moves.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat other vagabond who may be considered as being vaguely referred to\r\nat the head of this chapter has no possible kinship with him who has\r\nbeen desultorily sketched. Yet the two stand together in my mind in a\r\nkind of vague relationship of character. I was not surprised at my\r\nfirst sight of a coyote, but he grew greatly upon me afterwards. It\r\nwas his voice. He is but a degenerate wolf,--the weakest of his\r\nfamily save in the one respect referred to,--but he is an old and\r\npersistent acquaintance of every frontiersman, ten times as numerous\r\nand prominent in every recollection of that far time of loneliness and\r\nsilence as any other beast.\r\n\r\nIf you visit Lincoln Park, at Chicago, you will find a special pen\r\ndevoted to the comfort and happiness of this little gray outcast of\r\nthe wilderness; and I may add that he does not appear there to any\r\nadvantage whatever. On the wide plains where there was nothing,\r\napparently, to eat, he was, for a coyote, usually in good condition.\r\nHis coat was tolerably smooth sometimes, and he was industrious and\r\nalert. Here, where he is regularly fed at the public expense, he is so\r\nshabby that one hesitates to be caught looking at him as one goes by.\r\nThere is that about an animal that expresses unhappiness as plainly as\r\nit is expressed by men, and the Lincoln Park coyote is unquestionably\r\nthe most abject specimen of his entire disreputable family.\r\n\r\nThe reader will understand that in all I may have to say about the\r\nlittle reprobate I do not refer for any particulars to that\r\nincarcerated and unhappy vagabond just mentioned. On the contrary, he\r\nwas the first sensation of my earliest border experiences. He came the\r\nfirst night, and every night thereafter, for several years. I grew to\r\nknow him well, and have had many a brief and solitary interlude of\r\nmingled amusement and vexation on his account, when there was nothing\r\nelse on earth to laugh at or be sorry about. I often have shot at him,\r\nusually at very long range, but never to my knowledge killed, or even\r\nscared him. It is well understood that he always knows whether or not\r\nyou have with you a gun, and will be distant or familiar accordingly.\r\nBut finally exasperated by a wariness so constant, I have sought\r\nrevenge by a form of murder that I do not now claim, upon reflection,\r\nwas entirely in self-defence or perfectly justifiable, and which to\r\nthis day remains a red stain upon an otherwise fair reputation. I\r\nkilled twenty odd of him in a single night with insidious strychnine\r\nand a dead mule, and in the morning was astonished not so much at the\r\nslaughter as at the fact that he had not suspected the somewhat worn\r\nexpedient, and avoided the banquet.\r\n\r\nThe trouble with him is, that he does not avoid anything that may be\r\nimagined to be good to eat. If there was ever an animal\r\npreternaturally and continually hungry, it was the old-time coyote of\r\nthe plains of western Kansas and the mountains and plateaux of\r\nsouthern New Mexico. Yet no one ever saw a starved coyote, or found a\r\ndead one. The odor of the camp-fire frying-pan reached him a long way\r\noff, and was irresistible. He crept nearer and nearer, as the evening\r\npassed, and finally the camp was surrounded by a gray cordon who\r\ncrouched and licked their jaws, and kept still and waited. But when\r\nthe little fire was dead and the voices had ceased, and every man lay\r\nwrapped in slumber and his blankets, the tuneful side of his nature\r\nwould get the better of him, and he began to faintly whine. He was\r\ngetting the key-note, and ascertaining the pitch. The first faint\r\nyelp, imprudently uttered, affected his companions as yawning does\r\nmen, and now a still hungrier one gives utterance to a screech so\r\nentirely coyotish that the example is irresistible. Then pandemonium\r\nawakes. Each vagabond rises up, sits upon his tail, elevates his chin,\r\nand gives utterance to a series of yelps that rise in crescendo,\r\nregardless of time, or measure, or interval, or the lateness of the\r\nhour. Then, when the camp was new, and the men were beginners in that\r\nstrange and lonely life that often kept its unexplained and\r\nindescribable charm for them ever afterwards, there would be\r\nresponsive sleeplessness and profanity. The hardest ordeal was to\r\nbecome finally accustomed to this nightly pandemonium, which no effort\r\ncould prevent, no vigilance avoid. The first effect was to be\r\nslightly, though privately, frightened. The next was to intensify the\r\nfeeling of lonesomeness. One lay in torment, silent, sleepless,\r\nwondering if it was a common thing, and if it were possible to yelp a\r\nhuman creature to death in the course of time. Then one talked to his\r\ncompanions, and perhaps expressed himself in a couple of languages.\r\nThe most futile of all toil would be an attempt to drive the singers\r\naway. Silent only for a moment, they would all come back again and\r\nmake up for lost time. This is how the early wanderers in what is\r\ndestined to be the garden of the Union first made the acquaintance of\r\nthe most characteristic animal of the country, and this is why he\r\ndwells in the memory of every man who ever slept beneath the sparkling\r\ndome west of the Missouri the sweet sleep of toil and health--a sleep\r\nthat by-and-by was uninterrupted by all the night-sounds the\r\nwilderness might invent except the stealthy footfall of some human\r\nstranger.\r\n\r\nAnd when the gray vagabond had become an accustomed nuisance he began\r\nto exercise his real calling; for all his other modes of obtaining a\r\nlivelihood are mere by-play to his actual business, which is stealing.\r\nIn this line he is something preternatural. He had in those days a\r\nremarkable liking for harness, straps, raw-hide, saddles, boots. He\r\nchewed the lariat from the pony's neck, and would steal a saddle and\r\ngnaw it beyond use or recognition by the owner. He would walk backward\r\nand draw anything that had a rancid smell a mile or so from where he\r\nfound it. He was accused of deliberately drawing the cork and spilling\r\nthe horse liniment, and of then lapping the fluid from the ground\r\nregardless of consequences. He would chew a belt of cartridges for the\r\nsake of the tallow with which they were coated, and spit them out\r\nagain in a dilapidated pile of sheet metal. Vagabond luck saved him\r\nfrom having the top of his head blown off during this meal; and I have\r\nknown a Mexican youth to be killed in trying to straighten some of\r\nthem out again. Whips and thongs were dainties, chewed, swallowed, and\r\ndigested without danger or difficulty. The owner was under the\r\nnecessity of looking after his boots more carefully when they were off\r\nthan when they were on, and axle-grease was a precious commodity\r\nstored for safe-keeping with the teamster's spare shirt, in some\r\narcanum of the equipage where the utmost diligence would not reveal\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIt was a most desolate country, whose silent leagues bore no\r\nsustenance, and whose creatures, save him, were few. He was\r\neverywhere, and the secret of his existence lay in his one\r\nvirtue--industry. He gathered a livelihood from the things despised of\r\nall others, and he seasoned it with content and made it answer. Never\r\na beetle or a lizard crossed his path unchased. Plainsmen said that\r\nwhen he encountered one of the little land-turtles or terrapins, then\r\ncommon, he staid with it until it died and the shell came off. He\r\nkilled the virulent little prairie rattlesnake, also plentiful enough,\r\nby seizing it in the middle and snapping its head off with a single\r\njerk, as one cracks a whip. But if he had been bitten he would always\r\nhave recovered. He chased jackass rabbits in pairs, and while one ran\r\nstraight after the rabbit the other would cut across the angle, and\r\nthus the two would run down an animal that, when really on business,\r\nis able to fling his heels derisively in the face of the best-bred\r\ngreyhound. And when they had caught him there was always a\r\ncontroversy. No coyote ever divided honorably. That \"honor among\r\nthieves,\" so often mentioned, was not in his education. He sucked\r\neggs--all that he could find; and when anything died within ten miles\r\nor so he knew it. He was contemporary with the bison, and was the\r\nbison's assassin; for when age and decrepitude overtook the shaggy\r\nbull, and three or four lame and grizzled companions went off\r\ntogether, he and his companions literally nagged them to death one by\r\none. If the veteran lay down, they bit him. As long as he remained on\r\nfoot they followed and teased him. When he died, they fought over and\r\nate him, denying even a morsel to the buzzards and ravens. They\r\nfollowed the Indian hunting-parties, thankful for the morsels that\r\nfell to them, which were not many; for the noble red man was himself\r\nno disdainer of viscera: he included the whole internal economy under\r\nthe possible head of tripe, and if in haste ate it raw; and all he\r\nleft of a dead buffalo was a hard-earned morsel even for a coyote, if\r\nhe had come far to get it.\r\n\r\nAnd when the white hunter came, then was the time of feasting for\r\n_canis latrans_ in all his squalid days. He was the only creature\r\nbenefited by a ceaseless slaughter of about twenty years; a slaughter\r\nwhich meant nothing but a passion for killing, and which, leaving\r\nevery carcass where it fell, in about that time exterminated the\r\nbiggest, most imposing, and most numerous of the wild beasts of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nBy-and-by the railroads began to stretch their lonesome lines across\r\nthe plains, and the settlers began to come. For a certain time the\r\ncoyote seemed to retire before them, and there seemed a prospect for\r\nhis final extermination. Not he. When the cattle-men and pioneers grew\r\ntoo plentiful and meddlesome; when the new-comer began to lie in wait\r\nat night for the protection of the pigs and chickens reared in hope\r\nand toil; and when the unhesitating shot-gun was the companion of his\r\nvigils, sir coyote began to come back east and reoccupy the region he\r\nhad left. But under changed conditions. He is an animal of mental\r\nresource and acumen, and he changed his life. It is almost useless to\r\nadd that he became worse. Middle and eastern Kansas have him in\r\nconsiderable numbers now, and it is noticeable that whereas he once\r\nhad the impudence to sit and bark at the intruder like a dog as he\r\npassed by, he is now seldom seen or heard. Then he was merely a thief;\r\nnow he is a freebooter besides. He once burrowed in the hill-top, and\r\nlaunched his family upon the world in a comparatively open and\r\nrespectable manner, equipped only with teeth, instinct, and\r\nperseverance, confident of their future. He has now retired to the\r\nwoods that line the streams, and joined that disreputable brush\r\nsociety which was never very respectable among either coyotes or men.\r\nHe is clannish. Generation after generation stick together in the same\r\nretired locality, and sally forth at night among a population greatly\r\nricher in eatables than any he was formerly accustomed to. He no\r\nlonger wanders to and fro through a vastness in which his personality\r\nwas in keeping, and his slanting eyes and three-cornered visage now\r\nfind furtive occupation beside fence-chinks and through cracks and\r\nknot-holes. He knows a thousand devious ways which all in the end lead\r\nto the barn-yard. It is a bleak time with him when he is forced to\r\nresort to the catching of mice again; but when I see him loafing on\r\nthe sunny side of the stacks in a distant field I know what he is\r\nthere for, and wish him luck for old acquaintance' sake.\r\n\r\nStrangest of all, he has almost lost his voice, and the era of free\r\nconcerts is over. Down at the bottom of a ravine, perhaps immensely\r\ntickled at some toothsome find, he sometimes so far forgets himself as\r\nto give a yelp or two. This feeble demonstration usually attracts the\r\nattention of others than those intended, and perhaps the farmer's boy,\r\nthe inevitable mongrel dog with cock ears and phenomenal activity, and\r\nthe frequent fowling-piece harass him greatly for the time being. But\r\nit is not to be supposed that he has lost his ancient qualifications\r\nfor the performance of characteristic exploits. He merely suppresses\r\nthem for the present because it is his interest to do so. Versatile,\r\npersistent, and patient, he almost deserves respect for his\r\nuncomplaining acceptance of the conditions of a changed world, his\r\ncontempt for public opinion, and the common-sense which has led him to\r\ndecline to follow all his contemporaries into the limbo of\r\nextermination. When I see him now, the leer in his eye and the grin on\r\nhis mouth almost seem those of recognition. As of old, he wags his way\r\nalong the top of the high divide, but now fenced and full of spotted\r\ncattle, with the same pensive, quick-turning, alert head, the same\r\njog-trot, the same lolling red tongue, the same plume trailing along\r\nbehind, ever mindful of a coyote's affairs, ever thinking of his next\r\nmeal. Yet he is so much like his cousin, the dog, that know him never\r\nso well you can hardly help whistling to him. And when you have passed\r\nby, if you will look back you will see him sitting upon his tail and\r\nlooking after you with the same expression which in the olden time\r\nmade you know that he was wondering where you were going to camp, and\r\nwhether, when he had barked you into stupidity or death, there was\r\nanything about you rancid, portable, dragable, tough, but perchance\r\ncoming within the wide range of a coyote's menu.\r\n\r\n                                        JAMES W. STEELE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A MEMORY._\r\n\r\n\r\n    On Narragansett's storm-beat sand\r\n      We walked with slow, reluctant feet;\r\n    I held enclasped her slender hand,\r\n      With loved possession, deep and sweet.\r\n    Out on the wave the wild foam swung,\r\n    The circling sea-gulls upward sprung;\r\n    While o'er the level sand the sea\r\n    Came rolling soft and dreamily.\r\n\r\n    The sunset's glow was on her cheek,\r\n      Where love and heaven seemed to blend;\r\n    So full our hearts we could not speak,\r\n      As summer's glories found an end.\r\n    What tender lights sieved through the mist,\r\n    As waves and sunlight sparkling kissed,\r\n    While o'er the sea, to setting sun,\r\n    Swung thunder of the evening gun!\r\n\r\n    Ah! gentle form, what gift was thine\r\n      To give the sky a deeper blue,\r\n    To make the barren sands divine,\r\n      And heaving sea a rosier hue?\r\n    'Twas morn of life, and love's sweet glance\r\n    Gave dreary years their one romance,\r\n    When yielding form and tender eyes\r\n    Return to earth its paradise.\r\n\r\n    On Narragansett's dreary sand,\r\n      Now bent and old, alone I stray,\r\n    Nor see the lights, nor waves, nor land,\r\n      But one lone grave so far away.\r\n    The storm-tossed foam and gulls distraught\r\n    Return like dreams, with haunted thought--\r\n    \"No more, no more, oh! never more!\"\r\n    Moan the dark waves along the shore.\r\n\r\n                                        PAUL DAVIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE NIGHT OF THE FRENCH BALL._\r\n\r\n\r\nA detective is well used to the unusual and to meeting as cold facts\r\nwhat, when told, seems a tissue of the wildest improbabilities. During\r\nmy experience I had one case which for certain strange features I have\r\nnever had surpassed. It seemed to make itself into my hand as clear as\r\na first lesson in reading for a child, until almost the end, and then\r\ncame points which are hard enough to unravel.\r\n\r\nIt occurred years ago, on the evening of the French Ball. I was free,\r\nand attended it. It was the usual thing. The Academy of Music was\r\nfilled with gay women and young fellows about town. By twelve o'clock\r\nthe wanton hilarity was beginning to get well under way. The women\r\nwere leaning heavily on their partners' arms and indulging in loud\r\nlaughter, while the steps were more vigorous than decorous. The\r\nhigh-kicking had begun. My attention had been particularly drawn to\r\none young woman. She was not very tall, but was beautifully made. She\r\nwas dressed like a Columbine. Her short, pointed skirt of yellow silk\r\nand blue velvet came hardly to her knees, and the waist was quite\r\ndécolleté. On her blond hair was perched a conical cap with tiny\r\nsilver bells on it. Around her face was wound a piece of white lace to\r\nserve as a mask. I noticed her because she was such an exquisitely\r\ngraceful dancer. Her small feet, cased in gold shoes with high heels,\r\ntwinkled as prettily as possible as they lightly touched the waxed\r\nfloor. The dancing was an intense pleasure to her evidently. She could\r\nhardly keep her feet still during any pause in which she had not to\r\nmove. They would beat impatiently upon the floor, and she would toss\r\none in front of the other and sway her sinuous little figure,\r\nimpatiently waiting till her turn to dance came again.\r\n\r\nAs I was standing near the door looking at her a party of several\r\nyoung men came into the Academy. They stood and looked about and\r\npassed remarks on the scene as if they had not yet become acquainted\r\nwith its features. They had been to a theatre, probably, and came to\r\nthe ball after it. The eyes and cheeks of two or three of them were\r\nbright, as if they had been drinking. One young fellow seemed to be\r\nthe object of much attention from the others. He was a German, of\r\nmedium height, with blue eyes and exceedingly blond hair, while a rich\r\ncolor mantled in his cheeks. The others would make some remark or\r\ncomment on the scene to him, and he would laugh or smile with the air\r\nof a philosopher who had come to find a cynical enjoyment in the\r\ninsane folly of his kind. The others addressed him in German or\r\nFrench, and called him \"Graf.\" From his manner and appearance it did\r\nnot require much astuteness to conclude that he was a young German of\r\nrank who was visiting the country.\r\n\r\nOne of his companions turned to him with a broad smile and made some\r\nremark, pointing out one of the dancers. I looked in the direction and\r\nsaw my pretty blond Columbine pirouetting gracefully around, with her\r\narms stretched out to her partner, a big fellow who was a little\r\nfuddled with wine, and who had strayed out of the orbit of the girl in\r\na turn in the dance. She was not going to be balked of her share in\r\nthe measure, and tripped about by herself quite contentedly till he\r\nshould come back. It was an amusing touch to see the fairy-like\r\ncreature smiling good-naturedly, while the lumbering fellow who was\r\ndancing with her, or who should have been dancing with her, was\r\ngyrating beyond her reach. I glanced at the group of fellows to see if\r\nit was she they were observing.\r\n\r\nA change had come over the German. His face was as white as death, and\r\nhis eyes were dilated and fixed. He had fallen a little back of the\r\nothers, as if he did not wish to be observed. This was interesting,\r\nand I felt my professional instincts aroused. He answered their\r\nremarks with a rather hard, forced smile. A moment after he made some\r\nproposal or said something that seemed to be a surprise to them, and I\r\nsaw them shake hands with him. He left the hall in a hurried way. I\r\nslipped after him. I wished to see what he did. He stood for a moment\r\nin the foyer, and I saw his hands clinch fiercely. Then, in a\r\ndistraught sort of way, he walked around to one of the other entrances\r\nto the dancing-floor and looked about among the dancers. He tried not\r\nto get where he could be seen, and there was a fierce scowl on his\r\nface. I lounged slowly in the neighborhood, and watched him. The\r\ndeathly paleness had not left his face.\r\n\r\nAll at once he walked in upon the dancing-floor, with an attempt at\r\ncareless ease, and addressed a masker who wore the costume of a\r\nFranciscan friar, a roomy brown suit, with a rope knotted at his waist\r\nfor a cincture, and a large hood to it which he had pulled up over his\r\nhead. He was standing near the entrance. He was masked, so he was\r\npretty thoroughly disguised. The monk was not dancing.\r\n\r\nThe young German spoke to him, and then drew him out of the hall. In\r\nthe corridor he spoke more earnestly to him. The man seemed to be\r\ndeclining some invitation or request. But after a few moments of\r\nearnest speech from the German the two walked away, and, keeping them\r\nin view, I saw the pair leave the Academy.\r\n\r\nI was at first tempted to follow them. But having no more definite\r\npurpose than to see what would come of their movements, I concluded to\r\nremain and witness the fun at the ball, which always grew fast and\r\nfurious at the small hours of the morning.\r\n\r\nSo I resumed my old post and amused myself by watching the reckless\r\nextravagance of the mob of revellers. The little Columbine, though she\r\nhad been taking her share of the champagne, for I had seen her in the\r\nwine-room several times, was very firm on her feet. Her eyes twinkled\r\nwith a lazy sort of brightness. She had a better partner now, a little\r\nyoung fellow dressed in black tights and a short velvet jacket. They\r\nwere coming down the middle of the room, his right arm around her\r\nwaist. Every few steps as they advanced, both facing forward, they\r\nflung their legs in the air with a wild but graceful vigor. Then they\r\nwould whirl around to a sort of waltz-step, which the man in tights\r\nwould wind up by clasping the Columbine firmly around the waist and\r\ngyrating so rapidly that her body was thrown out at right angles to\r\nhis own.\r\n\r\nThey attracted a great deal of attention, because the grace of their\r\nmovements was very great, despite the wild abandon of it. I do not\r\nknow how I came to remark it, but while they were mid-way on their\r\ncourse I saw the Franciscan monk come in at one of the entrances. He\r\nleaned against a pillar, and I saw him watching the pair.\r\n\r\nThey finished their bacchic course, and the youth in the black tights\r\nescorted the panting, smiling girl to a seat, where he made a mock bow\r\nof the deepest reverence and went off. I kept my eye still fixed on\r\nthe girl, who was smiling and fanning herself. Even then her little\r\nfeet beat the floor to the sound of the music.\r\n\r\nWhile she was sitting thus the monk came up and seated himself on a\r\nchair by her side. He made some remarks to her. She coquettishly\r\nanswered them. Then to another she shook her head with playful\r\ndetermination. The monk pressed the point, for he bent forward, though\r\nI noticed that when she turned towards him he seemed to shrink back.\r\n\r\nFinally Columbine sprang to her feet, took his arm, and with a\r\nhalf-regretful glance at the merry dancers left the room with him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next day the evening papers had a startling story. I have kept the\r\nnewspaper account. It was this:\r\n\r\n    \"A SEQUEL TO THE FRENCH BALL.\r\n\r\n    \"Those who were at the French Ball last night in the Academy\r\n    of Music may have remarked a young woman dressed as Columbine,\r\n    who excited a good deal of attention by her graceful dancing.\r\n    The giddy young thing will not dance at the next French Ball.\r\n    She was lying at the morgue this morning, stone dead, waiting\r\n    to be identified. It seems a cruel mockery, after her last\r\n    night's gayety, to behold her now, in her ball dress of black\r\n    and yellow velvet, lying till someone shall tell who she is.\r\n    Failing all identification, some doctor's scalpel will dissect\r\n    the corpse and study the muscles which worked so healthfully\r\n    in the dance.\r\n\r\n    \"The young girl was strangled to death last night in a\r\n    carriage. She left the ball with some one dressed like a\r\n    Franciscan monk, at two o'clock. The monk gave a card to the\r\n    driver, after printing on it 'No. -- 120th Street.' He also\r\n    gave the driver a twenty-dollar gold piece. All this without a\r\n    word. He was closely masked. The driver had only remarked that\r\n    his hand was very white and large, and that he wore a heavy\r\n    plain gold ring.\r\n\r\n    \"The two got in and he drove off. While he was driving along\r\n    the upper part of Madison Avenue he heard a sound which\r\n    attracted his attention. On looking round he saw that the door\r\n    of the carriage was open. He stopped, reached back with his\r\n    whip, and banged it to. He supposed the couple inside were\r\n    probably the worse for the wine they had taken at the ball,\r\n    and had either failed to shut the door, which had worked open,\r\n    or that the handle of the door had been fiddled with till it\r\n    opened, and they were too far gone to notice it.\r\n\r\n    \"At all events the twenty-dollar gold piece had made the\r\n    driver disposed to be obliging, and he had pushed it to for\r\n    them, and driven on. When he reached 120th Street, at the\r\n    designated number, he got off the box and opened the carriage\r\n    door.\r\n\r\n    \"A lamp-post in front of the house lit up the carriage. The\r\n    curtains of the carriage windows had been drawn. They were not\r\n    drawn when the couple got in. What he saw terrified him.\r\n    Columbine was lying, with her white wraps fallen about her,\r\n    between the seats, and a monk's frock and a girdle of rope,\r\n    together with a mask, were tossed on a seat. The monk had\r\n    disappeared!\r\n\r\n    \"The hackman shook the girl and tried to rouse her, but could\r\n    not. He pulled her forward, and then saw that her face was\r\n    frightfully red, and that the eyes were puffed out. On the\r\n    throat were the marks of fingers where a terrible grip had\r\n    been taken of her neck.\r\n\r\n    \"The story was clear enough. The monk, whoever he was, had\r\n    strangled the girl in the carriage, and had then thrown off\r\n    his disguise and let himself out at the door while the\r\n    carriage was still in motion.\r\n\r\n    \"This savage crime was evidently premeditated. The masker had\r\n    printed the address, had not spoken a word, and had paid the\r\n    fare before entering the carriage. So there was not the sound\r\n    of his voice, or his handwriting, to identify him, and his\r\n    form and face had been completely hidden.\r\n\r\n    \"The cabman drove at once to the nearest police-station and\r\n    told his story. The body was taken to the morgue. The\r\n    detectives are at work on the case, which promises to be a very\r\n    pretty one. _Known_: a man masked as a monk who was at the\r\n    French Ball, and who had a large white hand, on which he wears,\r\n    or wore, a plain gold ring. _Unknown_: the murderer. Who is the\r\n    detective that will run down the game?\"\r\n\r\n\"Here he is,\" I said to myself, as I finished reading the account. I\r\nhad more points than the paper gave. The scenes at the ball came back\r\nto me very vividly now. The sudden deathly paleness of the German\r\nstranger, and his departure with the Franciscan friar! There was a\r\nconnection here that was too evident to be passed over.\r\n\r\nI determined to find out who had murdered the pretty Columbine, who\r\nhad won me so by her graceful dancing and smiling good-humor. Early\r\nthe next morning I went to the morgue. There she lay, the dainty\r\nfigure stretched out so stiff and cold in the big gloomy room. What a\r\ncontrast to the scene in which I had seen her last! There was a damp\r\ncloth over her face. When it was removed I saw a round, full face, the\r\nfeatures small and delicate. I gently pushed back the lids from her\r\neyes. They were a dark blue. Her blond hair was her own, and not a\r\nwig. I pictured to myself the smoothly-rounded cheeks with the warm\r\ncolor of life in them. I glanced regretfully at her feet, still in\r\ntheir high-heeled golden shoes. They had tripped to their last dance,\r\nthe dance of Death, and were motionless forever.\r\n\r\nI found that a beautiful emerald which I noticed pinned in her corsage\r\non the night of the ball was gone. It had been rudely plucked away,\r\nfor the lace about the edge of her dress was torn and hanging. But a\r\nlarge ring of rubies and diamonds had been left on her finger, and was\r\nkept at the station-house. I had remarked the emerald because it had\r\nan old-fashioned setting in gold, and impressed me as a family jewel.\r\n\r\nThe people who lived at No. -- 120th Street were a most respectable\r\nfamily, and a large one. They deprecated the publicity which the\r\nnumber of their house in the story of the murdered girl had thrust\r\nupon them. Inquiry into the character of this family satisfied me on\r\none point, that the monk had given that address simply because it was\r\na distant one, whether he had written it at random or had known the\r\npeople residing at the number.\r\n\r\nI went to all the transatlantic steamers which were in port and got\r\ntheir passenger-lists of the voyage over. In one that had arrived\r\nthree days before I found a name which I will call in this story Count\r\nHermann Stolzberger of Vienna. He was the only German count who had\r\ncome over in any of them.\r\n\r\nI made a tour of the swell hotels in the city and examined their\r\nregisters. In one on Fifth Avenue I found the entry, \"Hermann\r\nStolzberger and servant.\" He had arrived three days before.\r\n\r\nI engaged a room at the hotel. I wished to be in the neighborhood. I\r\nhad first inquired if Count Stolzberger had left town, and the clerk\r\nhad told me no. Where was he to go? The clerk had heard him say to a\r\nfriend that he expected to be in New York ten days or so. Was he in\r\nnow? No. He had gone out with friends and would not be back for\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\nThat evening I lounged around the office, sitting in the long corridor\r\ninto which the door from the street opened. I waited until twelve. No\r\nCount! I prolonged my guard for an hour more, and he had not appeared.\r\nI wished above all to get a look at Count Hermann Stolzberger. He\r\nmight, it was true, have gone in at the ladies' entrance, or he might\r\nremain out all night. On the other hand, he possibly had delayed with\r\nfriends and would yet return. I waited.\r\n\r\nMy patience was rewarded. At half-past one a cab rolled up to the\r\ndoor, and a young man in a large overcoat, somewhat foreign in its\r\nmode, sprang out and walked with a quick, nervous tread into the\r\ncorridor. He walked rapidly by, but my eye had taken him in from the\r\nmoment he opened the door. My memory of faces is excellent. I\r\nrecognized the blond fairness of the Count at once, though there was\r\nnot much color in his cheeks, and his face looked worn and thin.\r\nCount Hermann Stolzberger was the young German who had entered the\r\nFrench Ball and turned pale at the sight of the Columbine!\r\n\r\nI have said that this case almost seemed to unroll itself for me; but\r\nthere were two or three connections to be made to constitute proof,\r\nand not leave me with a distinct suspicion only.\r\n\r\nI visited the morgue daily in hope of some clue, but none came. No one\r\nidentified the body, and after the allotted length of time it went to\r\nthe dissecting-table. There were hundreds of visitors to see it, and a\r\ngreat deal of sympathy was expressed; but that was all. Nobody claimed\r\nit or seemed to have known the poor girl.\r\n\r\nA costumer had claimed the Franciscan's robe. I fancy he did this more\r\nthrough curiosity to find if it were the one he had let than on\r\naccount of the value of it, for it must have been very cheap. I got\r\nthe address of this man and called on him. I asked him if he\r\nremembered the man who had hired it. He said he did. It was a\r\nsmooth-faced, dark-complexioned man of about forty. He remembered,\r\nbecause he had made some joke with him about his being clean shaven\r\nenough for a monk.\r\n\r\nThe man had given no address, and he did not know who he was. This was\r\na slight hitch in the proceedings. I was convinced that the murderer\r\nin the garb of the Franciscan friar was not the man who had engaged it\r\nof the costumer, but the German. He was of much the same size and\r\nbuild as the original monk, and so he had assumed the loose brown\r\nhabit without exciting my attention. But the fact of the German's\r\nturning so pale and calling the monk out from the dance had made me\r\nfeel that he was the one who had strangled the gay Columbine in the\r\ncarriage that night.\r\n\r\nThe Count seemed to grow visibly thinner. There was a drawn look to\r\nhis face, and during the time that the dead girl lay at the morgue he\r\nseemed to be held by some terrible thought. I had shadowed him closely\r\nto see if he ever went to see the remains, but he did not go near\r\nthem. His terrible secret was telling on him fearfully, however. The\r\ncolor had become faint in his cheeks, and his eyes had a haggard look.\r\nWhen he was with others he would affect a gayety that drove much of\r\nthis distressing expression from his face; but when he came home alone\r\nit was very marked.\r\n\r\nSomething had to be done if I was to secure the proof that would\r\nconvict the Count. It was the third day since I had come to the hotel\r\nand busied myself in studying him. He had gone to the reading-room,\r\ncontrary to his usual habit, after finishing his breakfast. While he\r\nwas there two of his friends came in, and they began conversing\r\ntogether. I slipped across the way and hastily wrote a message, sealed\r\nit, and charged a messenger-boy to deliver it, saying that he was to\r\nwait and see if any answer would be given.\r\n\r\nI hurried back to the reading-room of the hotel again. The Count and\r\nhis friends were still there. If they only remained till the messenger\r\narrived! I had seated myself in a corner behind some one, but with my\r\neyes commanding a full view of the three. The message did come before\r\nthey left. One of the hotel clerks brought it in. The Count tore open\r\nthe envelope and read the note. I could not but admire his\r\nself-control. The nostrils expanded and hardened, and a stolid look\r\ncrept into his eyes for a moment; but that was all. What he read was\r\nthis: \"You know and I know whose hands left those marks on the throat.\r\nWhy do you not wear your gold ring?\"\r\n\r\nHe remained in thought for a moment. Then he lightly excused himself\r\nto his friends and went out, having asked something of the servant. He\r\nhad gone to see the messenger-boy. I did not fear the description he\r\nwould get being of much help to him. He was not gone very long. When\r\nhe returned he talked easily to his two friends, and after a little\r\nwhile they went out together.\r\n\r\nWhen he came in that night a letter was waiting for him which had come\r\nthrough the mail. \"What good did it do to kill Columbine?\" was all\r\nthere was in it.\r\n\r\nThe next morning when he awoke he found a note under his door. Its\r\ncontents were these words: \"Is it harder to be choked to death by ten\r\nfingers or by a rope?\"\r\n\r\nThere was a far more guarded expression about his face after these\r\nnotes than before. He always wore a fixed, stolid calm now. He\r\nevidently felt that some eye was on him, and he could not tell when or\r\nwhere.\r\n\r\nThe evening of the following day he received another message. It ran:\r\n\"Leave New York at once if you would save your neck.\"\r\n\r\nThe Count was too sharp for me. He did not go. But he did not go out\r\nso much in the daytime. He could not altogether cloak his feelings.\r\nThere was a disposition on his part to take quick, searching glances\r\nabout him.\r\n\r\nBut the strain on him was telling. It cost him more effort to keep\r\nfrom looking troubled. His face got thinner and paler. I was\r\n\"shadowing\" him closely; but I had to be very careful, for he was\r\ntrying to discover who it was that was on his tracks.\r\n\r\nOne morning he went out about the hour he generally left the hotel. It\r\nwas the fourth day after the note which advised him to leave New York.\r\nHe went directly to a railroad station and took the train for Chicago.\r\nI was prepared for this emergency, and went on the same train.\r\n\r\nWhen it arrived in Chicago, he went to the Palmer House and registered\r\nas Karl Schlechter. He had not been in his room half an hour when a\r\nnote was given him. It had been sent by a messenger-boy. \"Karl\r\nSchlechter is Count Herman Stolzberger, and the halter is as near him\r\nin Chicago as in New York,\" ran the note.\r\n\r\nIt seemed almost cruel to pursue him like a Nemesis; but I thought of\r\nthe gay Columbine whose young life had been mercilessly choked out of\r\nher by his smooth white hands, and did not desist.\r\n\r\nHe left Chicago that night after sending a telegram. Probably it was\r\nto his man in New York. He went west as far as Kansas City. A note was\r\nhanded him in the same way as soon as he had got well settled at his\r\nhotel: \"The ghost of a strangled girl does not care for place.\"\r\n\r\nHe remained here only a day, sending another telegram. When the train\r\nhad started which carried him away, he walked through the cars\r\ndeliberately looking at the passengers.\r\n\r\nAt Denver the old story was repeated: \"Eyes sharper than your own are\r\nstill on you. You cannot escape the hold of your murdered victim.\"\r\n\r\nThe next step was to Salt Lake City. He went through the same tactics\r\non the cars, and his sharp eye took me in.\r\n\r\nA new note reached him at the Walker House. \"It may not be long before\r\nwe meet again, and then my fingers will be at your throat.\"\r\n\r\nIn the evening after dinner he was in the billiard-room of the hotel.\r\nHe saw me there and finally came and seated himself by my side. He\r\nengaged me in conversation. He spoke English in a broken way which\r\nthere is no need to reproduce.\r\n\r\n\"Was I from New York?\" he began.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you travelling for pleasure or business?\" he asked next.\r\n\r\n\"For pleasure,\" I answered.\r\n\r\n\"A foreigner is a little surprised when he sees an American travelling\r\nin his own country. It seems as if he must be familiar with it. Where\r\nare you going from here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I am not settled. I drift where the humor takes me.\"\r\n\r\nI saw I had become the subject of his suspicions. But he did not yet\r\nknow me as the author of the notes.\r\n\r\nHe did not remain long in Salt Lake City. I went from the place when\r\nhe did. He had noticed me once or twice and felt certain I was\r\nfollowing him. He went to San Francisco direct. When we arrived there,\r\nhe gave some order to a hackman, before stepping into the carriage. I\r\nengaged another hackman.\r\n\r\n\"Follow that carriage until the man gets out, but only keep close\r\nenough to know where it goes.\"\r\n\r\nThe hack in which the Count had got travelled around without any\r\ndefinite termination apparently. He wished to know if anyone was\r\nfollowing him, and had told the hackman to see if another carriage was\r\nafter him. He soon found there was, and then he drove at once to the\r\nhotel, and hurried into the office.\r\n\r\nI got there a few moments later. I went to the register. His name was\r\nnot there at all. I looked around the place and found him sitting not\r\nfar off. He had begun to watch me. I went down stairs and gave a note\r\nto one of the boys to take out to the message office, and have it sent\r\nto Count Stolzberger. I had prepared it beforehand, so I was only gone\r\na moment. He kept me well in view all he could. When he finally went\r\nto register, he signed his right name, Count Stolzberger, and the\r\nclerk gave him the message which had been brought in.\r\n\r\nHe seemed puzzled. He had kept me in view ever since I arrived, and I\r\nhad had no time to write a note. So for a moment he did not know what\r\nto think. The note had said: \"The man who lent you the costume of the\r\nfriar has been found. There are not many more turns for you now. This\r\nman will recognize you when he sees you. Other witnesses will prove\r\nthat you spoke to Columbine, drove off with her in the hack, and that\r\nthe poor girl was found dead after your disappearance. What lacks to\r\nfit the rope to your neck?\"\r\n\r\nHe engaged his room, and soon after he had gone to it a boy came to me\r\nand asked me to go to the Count's room for a few moments.\r\n\r\nCount Stolzberger was sitting in an easy-chair near a table, on which\r\nthere was writing-material. He rose, greeted me with dignity, and\r\nmotioned me to a chair, asking me to sit down.\r\n\r\n\"You remember that we both came from Kansas City together, and that\r\npart of the journey was made in a sleeping-car,\" he said, with slow\r\ndeliberation.\r\n\r\n\"We may have done so,\" I answered.\r\n\r\n\"In the night I went through the pockets of your coat and vest. The\r\nresult of that investigation, and especially as regards certain notes\r\nmade by you on a sheet of paper, has shown me that you are a\r\ndetective, and that you are engaged in working up the case of the girl\r\nwho was--who died after the French Ball in New York. I am right, am I\r\nnot?\" he inquired, all in the same calm, measured way.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I replied. \"I have been keeping you in sight, Count, until the\r\nnecessary proofs were obtained that would convict the murderer.\"\r\n\r\n\"You fancy that I am the one who did the deed?\" he asked, in the same\r\nmeasured tones.\r\n\r\n\"I know it,\" I answered quietly, but with an air of conviction.\r\n\r\n\"Granting, for the moment, that you are right, what interest have you\r\nin bringing home the crime to me? Who has engaged you to do this?\"\r\n\r\n\"The pretty girl who was strangled, and a professional desire to work\r\nup the case.\"\r\n\r\n\"The several notes I have received were from you, I suppose,\" he\r\ncontinued, in his easy, careless tones.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you have the proof that I am the murderer?\" he inquired, turning\r\nhis eyes unflinchingly on me.\r\n\r\nI smiled. \"Count, I fear that everything is against you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You would be sadly mortified to find that you were mistaken, I\r\npresume.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should be sadly surprised,\" I returned, again with a quiet smile.\r\n\r\n\"What time did the hackman drive off with the monk and the girl?\" he\r\nasked me.\r\n\r\n\"At ten minutes past two. The hackman noted the time to see what hour\r\nhe could hope to get back for another fare.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, let me tell you something that may modify your search in this\r\nbusiness. I had made arrangements to go with the girl. I did not wish\r\nin any way to be connected with her departure. So just when we were\r\nready to go down to the carriage, I told her to wait for me at the\r\nentrance for five minutes. She said she would, and went down.\r\n\r\n\"I had put on the monk's garb over my evening dress. I threw it off\r\nand left it in one of the dressing-rooms. I hurried back to the floor\r\nand made it a point to show myself to several persons who knew me. I\r\nfeared that possibly some one had seen me talk to the monk, and would\r\nconnect the disappearance of Columbine afterward with a monk with\r\nthis. This was my reason for conspicuously showing myself after she\r\nhad gone out with me in the monk's dress.\r\n\r\n\"I was not away more than six or seven minutes, when I went back to\r\nthe dressing-room to put on the habit again. It was gone! I searched\r\nin the neighboring rooms, thinking some one might have moved it to\r\nsome other place. I could not find it. I then hastened down to the\r\nentrance to go with the Columbine in my dress-suit, with a mask on,\r\nfor I had slipped that in my breast.\r\n\r\n\"The girl was not there! I inquired of some of the bystanders, and\r\nthey told me that a monk had got into a carriage with her not five\r\nminutes before. Who that monk was I am as ignorant as yourself. You\r\nhave followed a false trail. I did _not_ go with the girl, and can\r\nprove an alibi for the next two hours after she drove off. Several of\r\nmy friends were with me from then till I went to my hotel, and my man\r\nknows the hour when I came home with them. I was terribly shocked the\r\nnext day when I heard of her mur--her death.\"\r\n\r\nI felt considerably taken back and very foolish. The Count's accents\r\nwere those of truth, and afterwards his assertions were fully borne\r\nout by witnesses. Who it was that murdered the unfortunate girl has\r\nremained the closest mystery ever since.\r\n\r\n\"Will you tell me your relation to the girl? Why did you turn pale\r\nwhen you saw her? And why did you wish to go with her, as you admit\r\nhaving wished to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"That,\" said the Count, with intense decision, \"you will never know\r\nfrom me.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I never did. There was a twofold mystery about what had seemed to\r\nme as clear as the alphabet. Never could I learn what were Count\r\nStolzberger's relations with the girl, nor who had murdered her in the\r\ncarriage after the ball.\r\n\r\n                                        PORTLAND WENTFORTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_DOES THE HIGH TARIFF AFFECT OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM?_\r\n\r\n\r\nWe had, before the war, the system of apprenticeship as practised to a\r\ngreat extent in Europe to-day. Its almost total extinction is laid at\r\nthe door of concentrated, and still concentrating, capital, aided by\r\nimproved machinery.\r\n\r\nSome may argue that our improved machinery has the tendency to\r\ncombine capital. This may be true in some measure; but, upon second\r\nthought, it will become clear to an impartial thinker that the\r\nprotective tariff is the chief cause, as is evidenced by its baneful\r\nresults--the trusts.\r\n\r\nUnder this new order, the shoemaker has no need of apprentices. The\r\nNorthern shoe-factory, which employs cheap foreign labor at\r\nlabor-saving machines, takes away his trade. He has, of course, a few\r\ncustomers for hand-made shoes, but his principal occupation consists\r\nin mending the poorly made shoes of the factory. He needs no\r\napprentices for that, but, in order to make a comfortable living for\r\nhis family and give his children the benefits of an education, he must\r\ncharge big prices; and I venture to predict that the time is not far\r\noff when it will be cheaper to the consumer to buy a new pair of shoes\r\nfrom the factory than to have the old ones half-soled and otherwise\r\nrepaired by the shoemaker of his town. This holds good in regard to\r\nother trades, and the question arises: What condition are we drifting\r\ninto?\r\n\r\nThe indications are that we shall have in the near future a\r\nmanufacturing class, a farming class, and a floating class. This\r\nfloating class deserves our serious consideration. It consists of a\r\nlarge body of men and women, shiftlessly changing from the merchant\r\nclass to the professions, and from the professions to the merchant\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nOur educational system helps to increase the confusion. Starting out\r\nwith the intention of making the schools of the country the foundation\r\nof a substantial education in the elementary branches, our educators\r\nhave allowed themselves to be carried away--through sheer enthusiasm,\r\nno doubt--from that simple and substantial basis of operation; and we\r\nhave to-day, as the necessary result, the most complicated, absurd,\r\nand absolutely useless educational system in the world.\r\n\r\nThere is no branch of human knowledge that is not taught in the public\r\nschools of the country; and the most remarkable fact about it is that\r\none solitary teacher is supposed to understand and to be able to teach\r\nthis endless variety of branches.\r\n\r\nFor whose benefit is such an education intended? For the large\r\nfloating population of the country; for the boys and girls whose\r\nparents have no positive intentions as to their children's future\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\nIn conversation with a public-school teacher I asked why he taught\r\ngeometry and trigonometry in the school. \"Well,\" he said, \"it is of\r\nnot much use, and takes valuable time from the rest of the scholars;\r\nbut some of the patrons wish to have their children study it, because\r\n_they might have future use for it_.\"\r\n\r\nWhen a few others wish Latin, German, or French taught, the teacher\r\nimmediately undertakes it, while the great mass of the pupils are\r\nactually starving for the most elementary knowledge of the\r\ncommon-school branches.\r\n\r\nWe have, in consequence, a class, composed principally of young men,\r\nwho have no education especially suited to any definite trade or\r\nprofession. This class is constantly growing, to the detriment of the\r\ncountry. The trades are driven to the wall by combined capital, and\r\nthere is literally nothing to do for many of our young men except to\r\nstand in a store as clerk or bookkeeper. Farmers' sons starting out in\r\nlife with a shallow education received from a shallow system look with\r\naversion upon the occupation of tiller of the soil, and, deluded by\r\nthe education received at the country school-house into the belief\r\nthat the world lays at their feet, go from one profession or trade to\r\nanother, never satisfied, never of any account, and never successful.\r\n\r\nIf a freer trade has a tendency to break up trusts and combinations of\r\ncapital, it will, in consequence, distribute the industries of the\r\ncountry more evenly among the people, and, by giving employment to our\r\nyoung men at home, will give them a definite aim in life and do away\r\nwith the silly demand for a university education in a common public\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n                                        EMIL LUDWIG SCHARF.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_MARCH 4th, 1889._\r\n\r\n\r\n    Hail to the new! unto the winner hail!\r\n      Hail to the rising, not the setting sun!\r\n      So runs the world: success, however won,\r\n    Dulleth, the while, his glory who doth fail.\r\n    Yet, as thou puttest off thy proven mail,\r\n      Strong soul that didst no issue ever shun,\r\n    Or at entrenched greed's resentment quail!\r\n      Hark to the swelling undertone--\"Well done!\"\r\n\r\n    Unto the canker which thy country's life\r\n      Yearly doth make flow more and more impure,\r\n    Thou wouldst, where needed most, have put the knife,\r\n      And from its root the pest begun to cure.\r\n    O brave chirurgeon! who shall end the strife\r\n      It matters not--thy fame remaineth sure.\r\n\r\n                                        ALFRED HENRY PETERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_EDITORIAL DEPARTMENT._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SALE OF THE PRESIDENCY.\r\n\r\nNo better illustration of the power wielded by the press has been\r\ngiven, since the London _Times_ took up the Crimean War and remodelled\r\nthe allied armies, than that of the New York _World_ in its assault on\r\nthe corruptions of the ballot that robbed the people of the United\r\nStates of their voted will at the late presidential election.\r\n\r\nThis monstrous crime against self-government would have faded from\r\npublic memory, and lost its place in the annals of iniquity, but for\r\nthe energy and enterprise of this journal, that sent an army of\r\ncorrespondents over the country and gathered the proofs of the open\r\nmarket in which was sold and bought the Presidency.\r\n\r\nThis fearful exposé of a burning shame was followed by messages from\r\ngovernors, and bills by legislatures, looking, not to the punishment\r\nof the wrong-doers, but to the enactment of preventive laws tending to\r\nthe protection of the people in the future.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed, however, that this potent power failed to bring\r\non any investigations, any indictments, or a single effort to punish\r\nthe guilty. This the _World_ demanded, but this the _World_ failed to\r\nobtain.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the impotent result in this one direction is easy to\r\ncomprehend when we get at the facts underlying the corruption. Neither\r\nparty was, or is, in a condition to demand an investigation, for the\r\nleaders of each are alike guilty. It is generally believed that money\r\nwas corruptly used by both organizations, and that the Republicans,\r\nhaving the larger sum, won in the end. This is true, but it is only\r\ntrue in part. Honest investigation would bring out the startling fact,\r\nthat the vast sums collected from millionaires, and the very\r\nsignificant amount assessed on office-holders, were for the one\r\npurpose of returning Benjamin Harrison to the Presidency and again\r\nputting the moneyed power of the country in the keeping of the\r\nRepublican party.\r\n\r\nThis manner of operating by corrupt means has long been well known to\r\nthe more observant. Corruption has no conscience, no patriotism, and\r\nno politics. All rascality rests on a purely business basis. When a\r\nmerchant seeks a partner, he does not bother himself about that\r\npartner's religious belief or party predilections. When rogues wish to\r\nform a trust or ring, they in like manner consider only the capacity\r\nof their brother-rogues, and when politics is at all considered, it is\r\nbecause of the safety from investigation found in having all sides\r\nimplicated. Thus, when the great Aqueduct steal of New York was\r\norganized, the managers were made up of both Democrats and\r\nRepublicans. When, therefore, an investigation went far enough to\r\ndevelop two prominent Republicans added to the responsible\r\ncommission, and one of those Republicans was called to the stand and\r\nasked how he came to accept such a position, he responded naïvely that\r\nhe sought to secure some of the patronage of the public work for his\r\nown party.\r\n\r\nNow, when we remember that President Cleveland, in the last hours of\r\nhis illustrious administration, made a deadly assault on a system that\r\noppressed the many for the benefit of a few, we get a clue to a\r\nmystery that has puzzled the masses. Vast sums were openly subscribed,\r\nand almost as openly used, in the purchase of votes to perpetuate the\r\ncorruption. And we had developed two startling facts that go to show\r\nthat our experiment of self-government is well-nigh a failure.\r\n\r\nThe first of these is that we have so cheapened the suffrage that we\r\nhave an element in between the two parties large enough to decide a\r\npresidential election of what we call \"floaters\"--that is, men who\r\nstand upon the street-corners, and crop out in the rural regions, with\r\ntheir votes in hand, for sale to the highest bidders. The market price\r\nvaries from five dollars to a hundred, as the demand may rule.\r\n\r\nThe second fact teaches that the election through States facilitates\r\nthis infamous abuse. We find that while President Cleveland won in the\r\npopular vote by nearly a hundred thousand majority, he lost the\r\npresidency. Through the electoral system we have developed two pivotal\r\nStates, and the market thus narrowed makes the corruption possible.\r\n\r\nIt is quite evident that we cannot narrow the suffrage, but it is\r\npossible to widen the vote; and if the patriotic people of the United\r\nStates care to sustain the great republic, and give to their children\r\nthe precious possession of a constitutional government, based on an\r\nequality of rights before the law, no time should be lost in wiping\r\nout an electoral system that has not only failed of its purpose, but\r\nis a source of peril to the government.\r\n\r\nIt is said of a distinguished politician of Pennsylvania that when\r\ncalled on to contribute money for the purpose of carrying a State\r\nelection, he, refusing, said, \"What's the use of wasting money on the\r\npeople in an election when you can purchase the legislature with\r\none-fourth the money?\" Now, immense as are the sums gotten through\r\nmonopoly and unjust taxation, they are not sufficient to purchase\r\nvotes throughout the entire country, to say nothing of the danger\r\nattending such an attempt.\r\n\r\nWe learn this from Col. Dudley's famous, or rather infamous, letter of\r\ninstruction to his subordinates. He wanted the floaters classed in\r\nblocks of five. This, not because the floaters were so numerous as to\r\nrequire such organized handling, but because it was a hazardous\r\nventure, and agents willing to transact the business were scarce. That\r\nthey were found in deacons, class-leaders, bankers, and Sunday-school\r\nteachers only shows the desperate condition to which the moneyed power\r\nwas reduced in its effort to secure again the control of our\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nHad the Democracy planted itself firmly upon honest ground and fought\r\nthis corruption because it was corrupt and not from a fever of\r\nexcitement to win at all hazards, it might have been defeated--probably\r\nwould have been. But in that defeat it would have held a position that\r\nwould now enable it to investigate, indict, and punish. As it is, we\r\nhave a great outcry and no efficient work. Col. Dudley goes acquit of\r\nall save public condemnation, not because of any difficulty attending a\r\nlegal condemnation, but because his accusers cannot enter court with\r\nclean hands.\r\n\r\nThis is an ugly statement to make; but for the sake of the political\r\nassociation with which we sympathize, and in whose cause, as developed\r\nin the late election, we are deeply interested, we feel it our duty to\r\nassert the truth in the plainest terms. The Democracy should remember\r\nthat in this corrupt game they must of necessity be the losers. The\r\ncorruption fund is and must be with their opponents. The gist of the\r\ncontention lies in the fact that the Democracy seek to arrest a\r\nrobbery that has already made their opponents rich, and the swag thus\r\nobtained affords the means through which it may be held. To enter such\r\nan arena is to enter it unarmed.\r\n\r\nSenator Plumb, when he made the assertion, subsequently published by\r\nauthority, that the only class really benefited by our system of\r\nextortion miscalled protection should have \"the fat fried out of it\"\r\nto carry on the election, unintentionally uttered a truth we cannot\r\nignore. This again was supplemented by Senator Ingalls's instruction\r\nto his State delegation at Chicago to nominate for the Vice-Presidency\r\n\"some fellow like Phelps who can tap Wall Street.\" And the evidence\r\ncloses with Col. Dudley's direction to organize \"the floaters in\r\nblocks of five.\"\r\n\r\nThese are noted and recognized leaders of the Republican party.\r\nSenators Plumb and Ingalls are not only prominent as such, but are men\r\nof brain and culture. Col. Dudley is known to the country as a\r\nprominent worker in the cause of the moneyed power. Now, while we\r\nmight hesitate to take the word of any one of these gentlemen when\r\nadvocating any measure of importance to their party, we are bound to\r\naccept all they assert against themselves, in accordance with\r\nwell-recognized principles of evidence.\r\n\r\nTheir admissions are fatal to their party, as their practice, if\r\ncontinued, will prove fatal to the Republic. We have some twenty-two\r\nState legislatures laboring to so amend the machinery of elections as\r\nto make this purchase of votes difficult, if not impossible. In this\r\ngood work the Democracy should be the zealous leaders, not only\r\nbecause it is reform, but because it is the salvation of the party.\r\n\r\nIf this corruption found in the mere purchase of votes ended with that\r\nfoul practice we might hope for something; but back of that, hid in\r\nthe darkness, lies the ugly, snaky form of treachery. The money\r\nsubscribed by millionaires is not always used in the camp of the party\r\nin whose behalf it was contributed. So long as rogues are countenanced\r\nin one direction they will be found in others. The startling fact that\r\nwe cannot have investigations for fear of uncovering our own people is\r\nsupplemented by another no less startling--that such investigation\r\nwould expose not only bribe-takers but traitors. We are not asserting\r\nthis without due consideration, and we give to print only what is\r\nknown by the more shrewd and observant in our own midst.\r\n\r\nThe proof of this is not necessary. The knowledge that corruption did\r\nexist carries with it assurance that it extended in such directions as\r\nthe wrong-doers found most efficient. When that sturdy old\r\ncorruptionist, Oakes Ames, was called upon to account for the stock of\r\nthe _Crédit Mobilier_ with which he had been intrusted, he replied\r\nthat he had placed it \"where it would do the most good,\" and his keen,\r\nincisive remark has passed into a popular proverb. The wretched,\r\ndegraded creature who sells his vote parts with an infinitesimal bit\r\nof power, and he is a saint and a gentleman by the side of the man\r\nwho, trusted by his party, betrays that trust for a moneyed\r\nconsideration. However, this carries us beyond our subject.\r\n\r\nThe truest and best reform that can be attained is the most radical,\r\nand that is, as we have said, to elect the President by a direct vote\r\nof the people, and do away with an electoral system that survived its\r\nusefulness in the death of George Washington. The next best is to\r\nsecure the secrecy of the ballot. Anything short of this is vain. When\r\nwe have so arranged the machine that the bribe-taker cannot make open\r\ndelivery of the stolen goods, we have driven the bribe-giver to\r\naccepting the word of a wretch whose oath would be worthless.\r\n\r\nIn view of the peril in which we find ourselves, with the very\r\nfoundations taken from under the tottering political fabric known as\r\nthe Great Republic, the anxiety manifested by our law-makers lest some\r\ncitizen may be deprived of his vote in this effort to purify the polls\r\nwould be ludicrous were it not that the subject is of so serious a\r\nnature. The very ground is sliding from under us, and these Solons are\r\nconcerned as to the shoes we may be deprived of in our effort at\r\nescape. Indeed, if to perfect the reform it became necessary not only\r\nto deprive a few citizens of the suffrage, but to hang Messrs. Plumb,\r\nIngalls, and Dudley, shocking as the sacrifice would be to us, we\r\nshould say, like a Roman father, let them hang. Indeed, undying fame\r\nhereafter would proclaim that in their deaths they had done their\r\ncountry some service.\r\n\r\n\r\nVACANT PEWS AND WORRIED PULPITS.\r\n\r\nThe homes, so called, of our larger cities are in a majority of cases\r\nwithout comfort, and in nearly all instances without refinement. The\r\nclass upon which we once so prided ourselves, made up of families\r\npossessed of a competence, and enabled through a reasonable income\r\nfrom steady work to have about their homes some comfort and a few\r\nluxuries, is rapidly disappearing. We have left us two classes only,\r\nmade up of the very rich and the poor. The merchant, the mechanic, and\r\neven the common laborer, who once could boast of a humble home of his\r\nown, and enough steady employment to make that home comfortable, is\r\nrarely met with. We believe indeed that he exists only in the\r\nimagination of Senator Edmunds. Well-authenticated statistics inform\r\nus that we have a larger percentage of tenantry to our population than\r\nany people on the face of the earth. This not only includes our great\r\ncommercial, mining, and manufacturing centres, but the rural regions\r\nas well. We learn that, throughout the agricultural regions, while the\r\nfarms lessen in number, the farmers increase.\r\n\r\nWe know what this means. We recognize at a glance that the growth of\r\nour country in national wealth, which is claimed to be amazing, is not\r\na healthy growth. For that is not healthy which gives prosperity to a\r\nfew and poverty to the masses.\r\n\r\nThis has been so long and so generally recognized that it has come to\r\nbe commonplace, and people weary of its reiteration. We indulge in\r\nthis weariness for the purpose of calling attention to a consequence\r\nthat is not so familiar.\r\n\r\nIt is remarked by observant lookers-on from abroad that our laboring\r\nclasses are thoroughly ignorant of art, and take no pleasure in\r\ncontemplating works of art, as do the like classes in the towns of\r\nEurope. The reason given for this is that we have no specimens in our\r\nhighways, and few in galleries. The latter are closed against the\r\nlaboring classes on the only day a laborer can have to visit them, and\r\nthat is Sunday.\r\n\r\nThe wrong done our people by this can scarcely be overestimated. A\r\ntaste for art can generally be cultivated. It is quite impossible to\r\neducate a people in science and literature, for this depends on\r\nintellectual faculties that our heavenly Father, from a wise purpose\r\nto us unknown, has been very sparing in distributing. But almost every\r\nman is capable of being taught to admire, if not love, the beautiful\r\nin art. What an element in the way of social improvement or progress\r\nthis cultivated taste is we all recognize, and what happens to a race\r\nthat neglects it we all know.\r\n\r\nNow, it is possible for a people to possess the highest appreciation\r\nof, and admiration for, art and yet be semi-barbarous, for the\r\nChristian element is necessary to bring about real civilization; but\r\nit is quite impossible for a race to be without some cultivation in\r\nthe way of art and be civilized at all.\r\n\r\nIt is not strange, to a thoughtful observer, to note that as a nation\r\nwe are on the down-grade. Such an observer from abroad cannot cross\r\nBroadway, for example, without learning that life and limb are in\r\nperil from a community that has more law and less order than any\r\npeople the world over. He is prepared to learn then that our galleries\r\nof art--such as exist--are closed against the poor, and he is ready to\r\nreceive without wonder the further fact that our churches also are\r\nclosed against the poor.\r\n\r\nIt is this last truth that is somewhat new in the way of being\r\nrecognized, although quite old as a matter of fact.\r\n\r\nAt a convocation of Protestant ministers held at Chickering Hall last\r\nNovember, on behalf of the Protestant community of New York, the\r\nfollowing was officially stated as to the religious condition of the\r\ncity:\r\n\r\n\"The population of New York City has for years been steadily and\r\nrapidly increasing, while at the same time the number of churches has\r\nbeen relatively decreasing. In 1840 there was one Protestant church to\r\nevery 2,400 people; in 1880, one to 3,000; and in 1887, one to 4,000.\"\r\n\r\nNow, to this startling admission could have been added another, no\r\nless deplorable, and that is that the attendance has decreased more\r\nrapidly than the churches, and, in such as now remain open a seventh\r\npart of the time, there is an exhibit of empty seats quite depressing\r\nto the minister. If we consider the Protestant population only, not\r\none-tenth are church attendants--and not a tenth of these are true\r\nbelievers.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this deplorable condition was much discussed by the\r\ngood men making up the clerical convention, and the prevailing opinion\r\nseemed to be, as gathered from the utterances, that this disheartening\r\nresult came from the active interference of the Catholic clergy--or\r\npapists, as our friends termed them.\r\n\r\nThere was much truth in this. These zealous \"papists\" are certainly\r\nmaking great inroads upon our population; but, admitting that they\r\ntake large numbers from the Protestant churches, there yet remains a\r\nvast population of non-going church people that the so-called papists\r\nhave not influenced, nor indeed as yet approached. What then is the\r\ncause of this irreligious condition?\r\n\r\nWe believe that we can help our clerical friends to a solution of this\r\nreligious mystery. It comes from a lack of consideration for the\r\nmasses they seek to instruct. There is a want of sympathy for the\r\npoor, that not only shuts the galleries of art from the laboring\r\nclasses, but closes the Protestant churches also.\r\n\r\nThese structures, while scarcely to be classed as works of art,--for\r\nthey are carefully divested of all that appeals to good taste,--are\r\nyet luxurious affairs at which the rich and well-born, in purple and\r\nfine linen, are expected to attend. They are more social than\r\nreligious affairs, and there is no place for the ragged, even if such\r\nappeared from a public bath, duly cleansed of their offensive dirt. To\r\nmake this exclusiveness complete, the churches are filled with pews\r\nthat, like boxes at the opera, are the property of subscribers able to\r\npay for such luxuries. True, certain pews are reserved as free seats\r\nfor the poor; but the class sought thus to be accommodated are averse\r\nto being put in their poverty on exhibition, as it were, even for the\r\nluxury of hearing a solemn-toned clergyman whose theological\r\ngymnastics are as much beyond the comprehension of the hearers as they\r\nare beyond that of the reverend orator himself.\r\n\r\nTo realize our condition in this respect, let our reader imagine, if\r\nhe can, our blessed Saviour and his apostles entering bodily, to-day,\r\none of these edifices built to His worship. Weary and travel-stained,\r\nclad in the coarsest of garments, the procession would scarcely start\r\nalong the dim-lit aisle before that austere creation of Nature in one\r\nof her most economical moods, the sexton, would hurry forward to repel\r\nfurther invasion of that most respectable sanctuary of God. Our\r\nSaviour would be informed that somewhere in the outlying spaces of\r\npoverty-stricken regions there was a mission-house suitable for such\r\nas He.\r\n\r\nWe must not be understood as intimating, let alone asseverating, aught\r\nagainst this form of Christianity. It is so much better than none that\r\nwe feel kindly toward it. The religious evolution that develops a\r\nrespectable sort of religious purity, that builds a marble pulpit and\r\nvelvet-cushioned pews, is all well enough if it quiets the conscience\r\nand soothes with trust the death-bed of even a Dives. We regard a\r\nSalvation Army, that makes a burlesque of religion as it goes shouting\r\nwith its toot-horns and stringed instruments, as to be tolerated,\r\nbecause it is better than the Bob Ingersolls. We only seek to inform\r\nthe well-meaning teachers of the religion of to-day why it is they\r\npreach to empty pews.\r\n\r\nFew of us are aware of what we are doing when we close our galleries\r\nand churches, and open our saloons to the poor. This last, so far, has\r\nproved impossible. But let our hot gospellers, whose creed is based on\r\n\"_Be-it-enacted_,\" visit any one of the poor abodes of the laborers\r\ndenied admission to innocent places of amusement on the only holiday\r\nthey have for such recreation. Such investigator will descend to a\r\nsubterranean excavation dug in the sewer-gas-filtered earth, where the\r\nwalls sweat disease and death. These are homes for humanity. Or he\r\nwill ascend rotten stairways to crowded rooms, heated to suffocation\r\nby pestilent air poisoned by over-used breath from men, women, and\r\nchildren, packed in regardless of health, comfort, and decency. These\r\nare the so-called homes of thousands and thousands: and the wonder is,\r\nnot that they die, but that they live. We send millions of money with\r\nmissionaries to foreign shores: to our own flesh and blood we\r\nsend--the police. Loving care and patient help are bestowed on distant\r\npagans: poor-houses, prisons, and wrath are the fate awarded to our\r\nbrothers at home.\r\n\r\nA little way from these abodes of misery and crime the saloon is open,\r\nwith its gilded iniquity, warm, cheerful, and stimulated with liquid\r\ninsanity in bottles and beer-kegs. Do we wonder that the churches are\r\nempty and the saloons crowded?\r\n\r\nThe advent of our blessed Saviour was heralded by the anthem of the\r\nheavenly hosts, that sang \"Glory to God on high, and peace and\r\ngood-will to men on earth.\" The few sad years of our Redeemer's life\r\namong men were passed with the poor, the sinful, and the sorrowing. We\r\nhave to-day much glory to God on high, and no good-will to men on\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nYour churches decrease in numbers as the population swells, O\r\nbrethren, because of your lack of Christian sympathy!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRUTH ABOUT SAMOA.\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to know at what precise period in Prince\r\nBismarck's masterful career he first conceived the scheme of colonial\r\nempire which has grown to be an absorbing passion of his declining\r\nyears. Probably it was about the time when he began to proclaim, with\r\nsuspicious energy, that nothing was farther from his designs than to\r\nrival the achievements of Great Britain in the field which that nation\r\nhad made almost exclusively its own. No modern statesman is better\r\nversed in the arts of diverting public attention from the enterprises\r\nhe has resolved to prosecute with his utmost strength and skill.\r\nEvents which rapidly followed the exhausting war of 1870 were\r\ncalculated to admonish him that Germany's resources were insufficient\r\nto maintain her in the position of supremacy to which he had led her.\r\nThe steady increase of emigration to America was one of the\r\ndiscomposing consequences of his splendid triumph, and the hope of\r\nretaining under German rule the tens of thousands of fighting men who\r\nannually deserted the fatherland may have been a powerful incentive to\r\ncolonial development in various attractive parts of the world.\r\nWhatever the original impelling motives were, there is now no doubt\r\nthat the plan of extending the German sway indefinitely by\r\nestablishing vast settlements in regions yet uncivilized, and making\r\nthem tributary to the glory and wealth of the empire he had created,\r\ntook possession of the Chancellor's mind, a dozen or more years ago,\r\nwith a tenacity which no discouragement or dissuasion has ever\r\nweakened. It was about that date that the unusual activity of German\r\nships of war in the Oriental seas excited the watchfulness of European\r\ngovernments and provoked inquiries which led to singular disclosures.\r\nThe methods of diplomatic investigation in the far East are in some\r\nrespects different from those which prevail nearer home--possibly\r\nowing to a lack of facility in employing them where official scrutiny\r\nis close and constant; and it might be injudicious to examine too\r\nminutely the processes by which it became known that the guardian of\r\nGermany's destinies was engaged in maturing a plot of territorial\r\naggrandizement the like of which has been devised by no other European\r\nstatesmen in recent days, and which has been paralleled only by the\r\nvivid imagination of the first Napoleon. It was soon learned that of\r\nthe numerous islands which constitute what is known as Polynesia, not\r\none of value had escaped visitation by carefully selected explorers,\r\nwhose errand it was to report upon the feasibility of eventually\r\nmaking the German flag supreme in the Southern Pacific, and delivering\r\nover enormous tracts of land to the domination of the German race.\r\n\r\nA glance at a map of the world will show how immense the possibilities\r\nof conquest in the East are to one who has fixed his resolve upon\r\nunscrupulous annexation or absorption. The natives of these regions\r\nare incapable of resistance, and nothing but the combined opposition\r\nof European naval powers could ever stand in the way of the gigantic\r\nenterprise. Such opposition Germany has--or believes she has--little\r\ncause to fear. Some of the leading nations are bound to support her\r\ninterests by alliances which they dare not break. France can interpose\r\nno obstacle that would be regarded with anxiety. Russia has no\r\nimmediate concern in the Asian archipelagos, and any claim put forward\r\nby the United States would be rejected with derision. Great Britain\r\nalone remains, and against her interference the German rulers are\r\nconfident that they have a sure safeguard in the traditional\r\napprehension of Russian encroachments in the north and west of Asia.\r\nWhile England is straining her eyes to scan the slightest movement of\r\nthe Czar toward China and Korea, and speculating incessantly upon the\r\noutcome of supposed intrigues which probably have no substantial\r\nexistence, Germany considers herself secure from molestation in other\r\nquarters. It is quite as likely, however, that the rooted English\r\nconviction of German incapacity to conduct colonial operations may\r\nmore reasonably account for the indifference to Bismarck's\r\nproceedings. From some cause, not yet clearly divulged, the Germans\r\nhave certainly been permitted to pursue their audacious course with\r\nsingular freedom from remonstrance. It cannot be surmised that the\r\nBritish authorities are ignorant of what is in progress. Even if they\r\nwere unprovided with direct sources of information, there is enough in\r\nthe avowed and unconcealed demonstrations of the past ten years to\r\nawaken jealousy. Without anything approaching a sound commercial basis\r\nfor the undertaking, the far-seeing Chancellor has established a huge\r\nnational steamship line, exceeding in length of route the extremest\r\nreach of the most important British maritime companies. From the\r\nBaltic ports this line runs southward, one arm extending through the\r\nMediterranean and the Red Sea, and skirting the continent of Asia\r\nuntil it comes to an end in Korean waters, while the other embraces\r\nalmost the entire coast of Africa, and, starting eastward, touches\r\nAustralia, penetrates the great Malay group, and finds a convenient\r\nterminus in the Samoa Islands, concerning which so much futile\r\ndiscussion has been wasted in the last few months. All along the\r\naforesaid African route the shores are dotted with German settlements,\r\noften planted in direct defiance of England's claim to priority, and\r\nmaintained in spite of every form of protest. The British flag has\r\nbeen affronted under circumstances far more flagrant than the world\r\nsuspects, yet the outrage has been passed over with careful avoidance\r\nof public scandal. Unless it is believed by the English government\r\nthat Bismarck's mighty conception is destined to an ignominious\r\ncollapse,--like an ill-balanced arch whose span is too ponderous for\r\nself-support,--it is difficult to conjecture the reasons for this\r\nprolonged submission to an insolent and unprecedented dictation.\r\n\r\nBut no apprehension of collapse disturbs the German statesman's\r\nundaunted soul. In his cabinet lie the maps of the reconstructed\r\nworld, upon which the future dominions of his country equal in\r\nmagnitude, if they do not surpass, those of the most extensive\r\nterritorial powers. The course of operations with respect to each\r\naccession is plainly marked out, and to the fulfilment of the\r\nstupendous whole he and those who bear his name are unalterably\r\npledged. It may be generations, even in his ambitious view, before the\r\ngreat result is attained, but no doubt of the final consummation is\r\nallowed to take shape among those who know the bent of the iron\r\nChancellor's will. Meanwhile, effective measures are employed to try\r\nthe temper and test the enduring faculties of the native races to be\r\nsubdued. Cruelty and barbarity mark the German range of advancement,\r\nwherever their footsteps are imprinted. In Africa and in most parts of\r\nAsia their name is held in terror and abhorrence. They are uniformly\r\nrepresented by men of Bismarck's own stamp, who shrink from nothing\r\nthat can accelerate the completion of their plans. The episode of\r\nSamoa affords a fair example of their intentions and their methods of\r\nexecution. What is Samoa? Simply a strategic point of departure--a\r\nstation that must be owned and held as a rallying-spot, a depot, and\r\nan arsenal. Having been once selected, it will never be surrendered,\r\nexcept under a pressure greater than the civilized world is willing or\r\nable, in Bismarck's belief, to concentrate upon such an object. The\r\nnotion that the Washington government can exert the minutest influence\r\nis too groundless to be entertained by any person who has studied the\r\nsituation. It is true that most of the European powers courteously\r\nabstain from offering opinions as to the result of American\r\nintervention, but the Chinese, who are aware of no reasons for\r\nreserve, openly laugh at it. The Japanese, more keenly alive to\r\nultimate consequences, do not laugh, but are grievously concerned at\r\nthe growing feebleness and irresolution of the only country that has\r\never permitted considerations of humanity to enter into its foreign\r\npolicy. Russia--strangely or not, as the observer may choose to\r\ndecide--is the sole great power that appears to cherish expectations\r\nof a future growth of American influence in the Eastern Hemisphere.\r\nGerman agents, acting under well-defined and easily comprehended\r\ninstructions, omit no opportunity to belittle and degrade the\r\nreputation of the United States in all the districts which are\r\nincluded in the scope of Bismarck's magnificent projects.\r\n\r\nBut the reputation of this Republic, for good or evil, is not the\r\nquestion now under consideration. What we desire to point out is the\r\nuselessness of attempting to controvert, by ordinary diplomatic means,\r\na scheme of wholesale aggrandizement to which the most resolute,\r\nunshrinking, and pitiless mind of this age devotes all its energy and\r\nall the instruments of material force now subject to its control. For\r\na considerable time a certain amount of reticence will be deemed\r\nnecessary, and the completest ignorance of the movement will be\r\nprofessed, especially by those who have been most actively concerned\r\nin the preparations. But the facts are known to so many who care\r\nnothing for the realization of Bismarck's hopes that the secret cannot\r\nlong remain a close one. It is hardly to be supposed, however, that\r\nthe fullest possible revelation, much as it might irritate him, would\r\nsubstantially modify his arrangements. It would perhaps retard them,\r\nand doubtless cause him to noisily disavow the whole proceeding; but\r\nthe machinery would continue to move as surely and efficiently as ever\r\ntoward the required end. This being understood, and thoughtfully\r\nconsidered as a firm and fixed purpose of the German rulers, to occupy\r\nas much of the coming century as is necessary for its execution, a\r\nsufficiently new light will be thrown upon the Samoan complication to\r\nshow that instead of being a petty incident of international debate,\r\nit is in truth the opening scene of a great and portentous historical\r\ndrama. To imagine that the hand which has contrived this colossal\r\nenterprise will falter at the first sound of adverse criticism is to\r\ntotally misapprehend the character of its owner and to blindly\r\ndisregard the lessons he has been teaching for a score of years.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INFANT MIND.\r\n\r\nHerbert Spencer holds that while the physical body is being developed,\r\nafter birth, until puberty, the real and only education is that which\r\ncomes from common experience through the senses. The mind, like the\r\nlimbs, is reaching eagerly out to take in the wonders of the new\r\nexistence, and the only parental care is that which protects the\r\ninfant being from the abuse found in over-exertion. Now the greatest\r\nharm that can happen to the innocent creature is the attempt to hasten\r\ninformation through mental stimulants. If left to itself, the mind,\r\nlike the body, will have a healthy growth. If, however, it is\r\ninterfered with through any forcing process, there will be an abnormal\r\ngrowth of some faculties at the expense of others, and disease or\r\ndeformity will result.\r\n\r\nWe note, with pleasure, how children race and play like kids or colts\r\nthe day through, and we fail to perceive that the mind keeps pace with\r\nthis active life. It is not only alive to its new existence, but\r\nenjoys what it finds in its open-air life. To interfere with this\r\nthrough the false system of training we are pleased to call education,\r\nis injurious, and often fatal.\r\n\r\nAll England--at least all the thinking part of the territory under\r\ngovernment of Her Gracious Majesty--is in a high state of alarm over\r\nthe stimulants administered through school examinations and the prizes\r\ngiven in consequence. Authors, scientists, and statesmen have joined\r\nin protesting against this abuse as a process that sickens the body\r\nand weakens the mind. It is a practice that is filling the hospitals,\r\npoor-houses, and asylums for the insane. We call this _cramming_. It\r\nis a forced, hot-house system, productive of more evils than good. Man\r\nis the only animal that loses his young to an extent that makes life\r\nexceptional. A majority of infants die before reaching the age of five\r\nyears. If we consider the matter carefully, we find that while the\r\nyoung of the brutes seldom have more than one enemy to contend with,\r\nan infant has three--the mother who pets it, the father who neglects\r\nit, and the pedagogue who makes an idiot of it. Death indorses them\r\nall. How common it is to meet a slender, thin-limbed girl with sombre\r\ncheeks and lustreless eyes wending her way to school fairly loaded\r\nwith books. She is being robbed of home, innocence, and health to\r\nsatisfy the Moloch of education.\r\n\r\nA most painful exhibit of--well, we will not say cruelty,\r\nbut--ignorance or indifference, our dramatic critic calls attention to\r\nin the case of \"Little Lord Fauntleroy.\" A child of tender years holds\r\nan audience for nearly three hours night after night, nearly all the\r\ntime upon the stage, by the most extraordinary effort of memory and an\r\ninstinctive turn for acting. This is a torture that discounts a Roman\r\namphitheatre or the bull-fights of Spain. What is the Society for the\r\nPrevention of Cruelty to Children about, that such an abuse should not\r\nonly continue, but spread?--for the success of the piece is such that\r\nwe shall have a hundred companies barn-storming over the land and\r\ntorturing the brains of as many unhappy children. It is on this\r\naccount that we rejoice with exceeding great joy over the death and\r\nfinal burying of Uncle Tom. This impossible old negro lived on little\r\nEva, and that angelic child has at last been consigned to many asylums\r\nfor idiots.\r\n\r\nFrom this wanton cruelty it is a comfort to turn to the innocent and\r\nnatural budding of the infant mind, and several specimens have floated\r\nin on us from various sources. Here is one from an indignant germ of a\r\ncitizen:\r\n\r\n    \"_Mr. Editor_\r\n\r\n    \"DEER SIR--Last nite we had a hie old time at our house next\r\n    dore. Mr. ----, a alderman cam home and broke things and beet\r\n    his wife--the nabors called the police, and they come and\r\n    would not take him in the patrul waggon because he was a\r\n    alderman, is that rite\r\n\r\n                    \"Yours to command\r\n                                        \"ROBERT\"\r\n\r\nWhen our little friend Robert grows to man's estate he will know\r\nbetter the privileges and immunities granted the alderman. That\r\nprivilege found in his right to beat his wife is not so well\r\nrecognized and understood as his right to beat the public. When a\r\nfellow pays from five to ten thousand dollars for the position of\r\ncity-father, it is expected that he will find a process through which\r\nto reimburse the private coffers of the municipal corporation called\r\nan alderman's pocket. There is nothing mean about the citizens of a\r\ngreat commercial centre. All that is asked is that the father\r\naforesaid shall not be caught at it. As for the little luxury of\r\ngetting drunk and beating his wife, that comes under the head of\r\nfreedom to the private citizen and a constitutional opposition to\r\nsumptuary laws.\r\n\r\nFrom this sunny side of aldermanic life we turn to some verse sent to\r\nus by a loving grandpa from the pen of Miss Elsie Rae. Our first and\r\nonly regret at not being an illustrated magazine is that we cannot\r\nreproduce the drawings that accompanied the poem:\r\n\r\n    THE BROOK.\r\n\r\n    As I sat by the brook yesterday,\r\n        I heard a voice by me say,\r\n    \"What are you doing here,\r\n        My sweet little dear?\r\n    Look around and see your mother,\r\n        Also your sweet little brother:\r\n    I brought him here because the air is so soft;\r\n\r\n    It is so hot up in the loft.\"\r\n        The child turned her head\r\n    And very softly said,\r\n        \"Well, dear little brother,\r\n    I am glad you brought him, mother.\"\r\n        \"Yes, dear, so am I;\r\n    But it is hard to carry him from so high.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE PASSING SHOW._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe month has been made notable by a high moral monument in the\r\nActors' Club, headed by Augustin Daly. We said moral; we mean\r\ntheological, for that was the true aspect of the commotion. It seems\r\nthat some friend of Robert Ingersoll proposed the name of that noted\r\npagan for membership to the club that Edwin Booth has so handsomely\r\nhoused. This came to the ears of the pious Daly, and immediately his\r\ntheological soul animated his theatrical body to an indignant\r\nopposition. Daly polled the pious body of actors. \"What!\" he said,\r\n\"shall we recognize and indorse this dreadful infidel, this\r\nunbelieving son of Illinois--have him among us as an associate, to\r\ndistil his poison of unbelief in our midst? Perish the thought! Let us\r\nrally round our altars and our fires [of the Actors' Club], and die,\r\nif necessary, as martyrs.\"\r\n\r\nThe grotesque part of this lies in the fact that while the pulpit\r\ndenounces the stage, the stage on the same ground assaults Bob\r\nIngersoll. It reminds one of a comic scene perpetrated in Sheridan's\r\n\"Rivals,\" where the master bangs the man, and the man, in turn, kicks\r\nthe many-buttoned page.\r\n\r\nNow, the Actors' Club is the same as any other social organization,\r\nand has the comforts and pleasures found in the intercourse of its\r\nmembers, its main purpose. In London and Washington, the only two\r\nplaces on earth where clubs flourish in perfect health, another and\r\nmore important object is to get the good things of life at cost. These\r\nare clubs of a social sort. There are others that have political\r\npurposes for an end, but these combine such objects with the more\r\nimportant features of the mere social organizations. To secure the\r\nlatter, wines, cigars, and viands at cost prices are what John Bull\r\naims at, and persists in carrying out to the letter. Without this your\r\nclub is a delusion and a snare.\r\n\r\nNow, if in the formation of these social centres it is necessary to\r\nhave a view to a man's respectability as well as his entertaining\r\nqualities, the first requisite of an applicant is to be a gentleman. A\r\nwhole coat, a clean shirt, and gentlemanly views, if any, are\r\nnecessary. What the member's views may be on any abstract proposition\r\nis of no import whatever. He may consider polygamy allowable; he may\r\neven believe in that governmental extortion miscalled \"protection,\" or\r\nin mind-reading, and yet be acceptable as an associate. The most\r\nfascinating club-man we ever knew was a little gone on _morus\r\nmulticaulus_. Another had a way of getting up the Nile, and it was\r\nalmost impossible for his friends to get him down again. When, in his\r\ntalk, he sailed up that classic river, his hearers, like the Arabs on\r\nits banks, \"stole silently away.\"\r\n\r\nWe have never heard that our modern pagan was anything but\r\nrespectable, and we are told that socially--if he can be got away from\r\nMoses--he is rather entertaining. If the rule applied to Robert the\r\nheathen were the measure used by clubs generally, there would not be\r\none left with a quorum in the country.\r\n\r\nNor will it do to apply to this noted person the rule recognized by\r\nMr. Booth's orphan asylum, that the heathen is not connected with the\r\nstage. He has won fame and fortune from behind the footlights. We\r\nnever enjoyed a comedy so much as that given us by the heathen in his\r\nlecture on \"The Mistakes of Moses.\" We laughed an hour \"by Shrewsbury\r\nclock,\" not so much at what the heathen said, as at seeing a corpulent\r\ngentleman in a dress suit prancing about the stage assailing Moses.\r\nNow Moses has been dead some years. He has no lineal descendants that\r\nwe know of, unless Moses and Sons, dealers in antique raiment, can be\r\nso considered; and of the two thousand people packed in that theatre\r\nthere probably were not six that had ever opened the Old Testament or\r\nthat cared a straw for the dead lawgiver. And yet the heathen seemed\r\nanimated by a personal feeling, as if Moses had, like Daly, on some\r\noccasion blackballed him.\r\n\r\nHe tore Moses all to pieces; he attacked his knowledge of astronomy;\r\nhe doubted his correct knowledge of ark-building. He said Moses was\r\ndefective as to ventilation. The fact is, that when this corpulent,\r\nunbelieving son of man got through there was not much left of the\r\neminent Hebrew. But it was a stage performance all the same, and put\r\nRobert at the head of low comedians. Hence he is qualified for an\r\nassociation with brother-actors.\r\n\r\nNo better instance of patient good-nature, backed by a woful lack of\r\nculture, can be had than in the performances given at two New York\r\ntheatres by a couple of society women--we beg pardon: we should say\r\n\"ladies.\" Mrs. Potter kills Cleopatra in the first act of \"Antony and\r\nCleopatra,\" by Shakespeare, Bacon, or somebody else; and Mrs. Langtry\r\ndoes to Lady Macbeth what Don Cæsar de Bazan found so objectionable in\r\nhanging. \"Hanging,\" cried the immortal Bohemian of aristocratic\r\nbirth, \"is horrible. It not only kills a man, it makes him\r\nridiculous.\" Mrs. Langtry's _Lady Macbeth_ should be relegated to\r\nthings which amuse. The audiences leave these burlesques with the\r\nquery put in the mouth of an English sailor at an exhibition of\r\npantomime and fireworks, who, being blown over the adjacent property,\r\ngot up and asked, \"What'll the cussed fool do next?\"\r\n\r\nThese are the days when there is a dearth of real dramatic art; when a\r\ntarnished reputation, superb costumes--or lack of costume--are\r\nconsidered indispensable adjuncts to the star actress; when real\r\nwater, miniature conflagrations that choke the audience with smoke, or\r\nstartling electrical novelties, are relied upon as the chief\r\nattractions of a new play; when the stage panders to the lowest\r\ntastes; when the spectacular supplants art. The question no longer is,\r\n\"What is the play? What are the lessons it teaches, the ideal thoughts\r\nit presents to us?\"--but rather, \"Who is the actress? What is the\r\nlatest scandal concerning her? How far does she outstrip her rivals in\r\nexhibitions of nudity?\" Hence we see such alterations of plan on the\r\npart of theatrical managers as the withdrawal of that witty play, \"The\r\nYeomen of the Guard,\" to make room at the Casino for the \"leg-show\" of\r\n\"Nadjy.\"\r\n\r\nOf course some of the blame for this state of things must rest on the\r\nsmall and noisy portion of the public who manage to control access to\r\nthe ears of proprietors and playwrights, such as, in the instance\r\nmentioned, the dudes and dudelets of the \"Casino crowd,\" who had grown\r\nweary of a play whose sparkling humor was above their comprehension. A\r\ngreater measure of blame rests upon the professional critics, who,\r\nwith a few very honorable exceptions, gauge praise or blame according\r\nto the length of the paid advertisements in their respective journals,\r\nor to the favors extended to them at the box-office. Not a score of\r\nyears ago an actor of very moderate attainments actually bought his\r\nway into prominence by giving elaborate dinners to his critics, and\r\nkeeping open house, with free-lunch counter and bar attachments, for\r\nthe benefit of every reporter whom he could form acquaintance with.\r\nSuch methods in a short time placed him on a pedestal of notoriety,\r\nand he no doubt hoped to stay there; but a new sensation came, and his\r\nstar declined. This is a fair statement of the condition of theatrical\r\nart in America. We have lost the freshness of originality, and we have\r\nnot yet attained to the depth of culture and breadth of criticism of\r\nthe literary centres of England and the Continent. We are very much\r\ninclined to pay homage to a name, no matter by what means such a name\r\nhas been acquired.\r\n\r\nMrs. Langtry's performance of _Lady Macbeth_ is an instance of this\r\ntendency to hero-worship. It is said in her favor that her\r\ncharacterization of the part shows deep study and hard work. But these\r\nare the very things that, were she possessed of real dramatic genius,\r\nwould never be allowed to show. The height of art is in imitating,\r\nrefining, and subliming nature. But if you allow all the secret wheels\r\nand springs to appear, it becomes no art at all. Mrs. Langtry's\r\neffort is a painstaking one, but the effort is too apparent. She\r\nattains no high ideal. When she appeared as _Lady Macbeth_ at the\r\nFifth Avenue Theatre, after weeks of preparation and puffery, it was\r\nexpected that she would give us something new, but the result has been\r\nonly her usual mediocrity.\r\n\r\nThe character is a combination of a great degree of unscrupulous\r\nambition and a share of wifely devotion. Lady Macbeth's crime is\r\npartly due to a desire for her husband's advancement; but the chief\r\nmotive clearly is, that through his advancement she may attain power.\r\nIt is this determination to stop at nothing which may forward her\r\nambitious schemes that makes the character one of the most terrible of\r\nShakspere's creations. Charlotte Cushman probably came nearer to the\r\ngreat poet's ideal than any actress before or since. Ellen Terry makes\r\nthe part ridiculous; Mrs. Langtry makes it commonplace. But there is\r\none scene for which she deserves great credit--the sleep-walk, where\r\nshe emerges from her room in a night-dress that looks like a shroud,\r\nher hair entirely concealed by a nightcap that is bound around her\r\nchin, her face pallid and expressionless. Then she begins her\r\nsoliloquy, no longer Mrs. Langtry, no longer _Lady Macbeth_, but a\r\nremorseful somnambulist, her words all delivered in the same dull\r\nmonotone, without emphasis or expression, like the voice of a soulless\r\ncorpse. It makes one shiver to hear her. But that is the only\r\nredeeming feature of her characterization.\r\n\r\nThe support is by no means good, but the scenery and costumes are well\r\nbrought out and historically accurate. Mr. Charles Coghlan is a fair\r\nreader of his lines, but falls far short of the ideal _Macbeth_. In\r\nfact, by far the best acting is that of Mr. Joseph Wheelock as\r\n_Macduff_. He plays the character with all the vim and enthusiasm that\r\nit demands, and he deservedly receives the largest share of applause\r\nfrom the audience.\r\n\r\nWhile Mrs. Langtry has been reaching out her long, voluptuous arms in\r\nan utterly futile attempt to touch the hem of _Lady Macbeth's_\r\ngarment, Mrs. Potter, arrayed like a queen of burlesque, and behaving\r\nlike a tipsy grisette at a mask-ball, has been insulting the\r\ntraditions of Egypt's queen. The performance of \"Antony and Cleopatra\"\r\nat Palmer's Theatre was, indeed, little better than a farce. It would\r\nbe hard to say which was worse, Mrs. Potter's _Cleopatra_ or Mr. Kyrle\r\nBellew's _Antony_. As Brutus was the noblest, so it may be said that\r\nMr. Bellew's _Antony_ is the most insignificant, Roman of them all. It\r\nwould be a waste of time and space to attempt a serious criticism of\r\neither of the two impersonations. In a mere spectacular sense the\r\nproduction was pleasing to the eye; but, historically, the scenery and\r\naccessories were absurdly inaccurate. To import the archaic\r\narchitecture of ancient Thebes in Upper Egypt into a city so purely\r\nGreek in its buildings, population, language, and customs as\r\nAlexandria was from its very foundation, is about as ignorant a\r\nblunder as it is possible for a scenic artist to make. And what\r\nbusiness Hindoo nautch-girls had in the Alexandria of Cleopatra is a\r\nconundrum which only a New York stage-manager can answer. We give it\r\nup. Mrs. Potter, too, seems to be unaware that Cleopatra was Greek,\r\nnot Egyptian; otherwise she would hardly mispronounce the initial\r\nconsonantal sound of the name of her Greek attendant, _Charmian_, as\r\nshe invariably does mispronounce it. Possibly her attention is so\r\ndeeply absorbed by the fascinations of Worth's millinery that she has\r\nno time to spare for such trivial matters as elocution and orthoepy.\r\n\r\nOutside of Mrs. Langtry's and Mrs. Potter's characterizations there\r\nhas been little of novelty. Nat Goodwin has dropped farce and\r\nbuffoonery, and essays a higher style of comedy, appearing as\r\n_Gringoire_ in \"A Royal Revenge,\" an adaptation of Theodore de\r\nBanville's play. The character has recently been made familiar by\r\nCoquelin. Mr. Goodwin becomes interesting as the starving poet, and\r\nhis personation gives promise of better things. The Grand Opera House\r\nwas filled with Nobles of the Mystic Shrine to welcome Mr. Goodwin's\r\nreappearance. At the Fifth Avenue Theatre, in March, he will produce a\r\nnew three-act comedy called \"A Gold Mine,\" by Brander Matthews and\r\nGeorge H. Jessop. The latter author, in collaboration with Horace\r\nTownsend, has produced for W. J. Scanlan a new Irish play entitled\r\n\"Myles Aroon,\" brought out at the Fourteenth Street Theatre. Lady\r\nGlover's head-gardener, _Myles Aroon_, is accused of stealing his\r\nmistress' bracelet. He falls in love with her daughter, proves his\r\ninnocence, and exposes the thief, who happens to be his rival. This\r\nthreadbare plot is treated with Scanlan's inimitable Irish humor, and\r\nthe play receives the popular appreciation it deserves. Of a similar\r\ncharacter is the play \"Running Wild,\" which was brought out at the\r\nStar Theatre, and offers abundant opportunity to Mr. John Wild's\r\nversatile comic talents.\r\n\r\nFarquhar's comedy, \"The Inconstant,\" recently played at Daly's\r\nTheatre, is an excellent revival of a good old English comedy. Ada\r\nRehan was at her best as _Oriana_. At Daly's one is always sure of\r\nfinding good plays, well acted. The company is a very even one,\r\nconsisting not of one or two stars and all the rest sticks, but of\r\nfair actors well used to each other and to the plays they bring out.\r\n\"The Runaway Wife,\" produced at Niblo's, is a play that is not wanting\r\nin dramatic merit, but it is somewhat spasmodic and jerky. Its\r\nauthors, McKee Rankin and Fred G. Maeder, have aimed at creating a\r\nseries of dramatic climaxes rather than a smoothly-running play.\r\nDaniel Bandmann has made a success as the _Comte de Maurienne_ in\r\n\"Austerlitz,\" a revival of Tom Taylor's drama, \"Dead or Alive.\" Marie\r\nWainwright presented us with a very girlish _Rosalind_ at the Star\r\nTheatre, Mr. Louis James playing _Orlando_ very effectively. \"Said\r\nPacha,\" a three-act comic opera, composed by Richard Stahl of San\r\nFrancisco, has met with success in the few cities where it has yet\r\nbeen played. The music at times is suggestive of Strauss and\r\nOffenbach. Herr August Junkermann, who has been delighting our German\r\nfellow-citizens at the Amberg Theatre, proved himself a character\r\nactor of quite a superior order, and has earned a reputation which\r\nwill insure him crowded houses whenever he appears in New York.\r\n\r\nThe best all-round performance given at any theatre this season is\r\nPinero's comedy of \"Sweet Lavender\" at the Lyceum. The play is as\r\nsweet and pure as a bunch of the fragrant old-fashioned flowers whose\r\nname it bears. The dialogue sparkles with wit and repartee of the most\r\ndelightful sort, and the acting is as charming as the piece itself.\r\nMiss Georgie Cayvan may have acted more important characters, but\r\nnever one in which she offered a more agreeable picture. There is a\r\nring of sweet womanliness through her performance, which, like the\r\ndelicate ferns and mosses that hide a violet, makes the fragrant\r\nblossom more precious. Miss Louise Dillon is so sweet that she is a\r\nlittle cloying. She clings about Mr. Henry Miller, who enacts her\r\nlover, in a limp and boneless fashion that is somewhat irritating to\r\none who remembers that a spine and a few muscles go to make up the\r\nhuman anatomy, as well as a heart. Mrs. Whiffen's performance is most\r\nagreeable, being all the more admirable from the fact that in the\r\nearlier scenes she is, by the exigencies of the piece, somewhat acid\r\nand acrid. Now everybody knows that for Mrs. Whiffen to be either one\r\nor the other of these things must be clever acting. Mrs. Walcot is far\r\nless satisfactory; she does not dress to the level of her character,\r\nand she is artificial, mincing, and sour. Lemoyne's work is simply\r\nbeyond praise. But little finer acting has ever been seen than his\r\nportrayal of _Richard Phenyl_. Very good, too, is Mr. Kelcey's\r\nperformance of a breezy young American; and of almost equal merit is\r\nthe rendering of the manly young lover by Mr. Miller. A thoroughly\r\ndisappointing performance is that of Mr. Walcot. His get-up of a\r\nprosperous, jovial English banker is admirable. But all cause for\r\nadmiration began and ended there; his acting never for one moment\r\nreached his make-up. When the scene called for feeling, he had\r\nnone--he was merely feeble and flaccid; in short, Mr. and Mrs. Walcot\r\nwere the only blots upon an otherwise perfect performance.\r\n\r\nWhen the long and prosperous run of \"Little Lord Fauntleroy\" is\r\nconsidered, the conclusion is inevitable that the theatre-going public\r\nof this city will bear anything. The three scenes that go to make up\r\nthis fatiguing representation are utterly void of a single principle\r\nof dramatic construction, and are entirely without dramatic incident,\r\nif we except the appearance upon the scene of a very \"scarlet woman.\"\r\nAnd that is not exactly the sort of dramatic element which is expected\r\nor desired. The feat of memory which the child Elsie Leslie performs\r\nis remarkable. But it is a very painful exhibition, for it will\r\ninevitably destroy the poor little creature, mentally and physically.\r\nTo point out all the manifold inconsistencies and absurdities of this\r\nnondescript entertainment would take up too much space, and bestow\r\nupon it much more advertising than it is worth. To instance a few of\r\nthem: An American, a middle-aged man, a prosperous grocer, himself\r\nbrings to the house of a customer a basket of groceries. He is\r\nushered into the sitting-room together with a bootblack, who also\r\ncalls at the same time; they are received as guests and friends, and\r\nare entertained by the infant hero, aged seven years! Later, this same\r\ngrocer and the bootblack, both being in correspondence with the infant\r\nhero, learn that he is threatened with the loss of his title,\r\nwhereupon they each offer him a partnership in their business.\r\nUltimately, these two go together to England, where they are received\r\nas guests by the haughty Earl who is the grandfather of the infant\r\nhero. And these things are offered to the public in a perfectly\r\nserious manner without any attempt at or any idea of humor. The\r\nmounting of the piece--to call it so, for want of a more fitting\r\ntitle--is as tawdry and shallow as the piece itself. The library at\r\nDorincourt Castle is ornamented by cheap tin toys, fastened upon\r\nplaques and hung on the walls. These things are supposed to be the\r\narmor and trappings of the knights of old who were the ancestry of\r\nthis great house. This library, which opens out onto a sort of terrace\r\nthat overlooks a body of water of about the dimensions of Lake\r\nMichigan, is lighted by numbers of cheap gas-jets--a manner of\r\nillumination unknown in any English country-house, far less an old\r\nfeudal castle. A number of good actors and actresses are brought on\r\nthe stage from time to time, but they have nothing whatever to do,\r\nconsequently they do nothing. They whirl and maunder through three\r\nhours of false sentiment and artificial virtue, ringing the changes on\r\nthe statement that they are \"bland, passionate, and deeply religious.\"\r\nThey also paint in water-colors, and \"of such is the kingdom of\r\nheaven.\" Silly women sit whimpering at it, servile men sympathize with\r\nthem, newspapers earn their \"ads\" by their false and fulsome praise,\r\nand the box-office flourishes.\r\n\r\nThe season of opera at the Metropolitan Opera House has been one of\r\nthe most successful ever known. A concerted attack has been made on\r\nGerman opera by those who prefer the ballet and the spectacular to the\r\npleasures of music. It was suggested that Italian opera be\r\nsubstituted, and it was hinted that there was a company in Rome open\r\nto an engagement. The Wagnerites grew furious, and protested. A\r\ncomparison of the box-office receipts in former seasons was\r\ninstituted, and the preponderance of popular favor was shown to be\r\nalways in favor of German opera, and especially of Wagner. That\r\nsettled it for a time, but a minor dispute arose. During the\r\nproduction of Wagner's masterpieces, like \"Rheingold\" and \"Die\r\nMeistersinger,\" in the scenes which are supposed to take place at\r\nnight or in the dark, the stage-manager lowered the lights in the\r\nhouse so that the glare should not mar the appropriateness of the\r\nscene. This did not at all suit the young ladies who know nothing\r\nabout music, but simply come to talk about Mrs. Millionaire's ball or\r\nto see each other's latest costumes. Their papas among the\r\nstockholders were coaxed into ordering the lights to be turned on.\r\nAgain the Wagnerites protested, and after three nights the management\r\nreturned to the old way, much to the satisfaction of real lovers of\r\nopera.\r\n\r\nThe production of Halévy's opera \"La Juive\" for the first time this\r\nseason was coincident with the reappearance of Frau Lilli Lehmann, who\r\nacted and sang the part of _Rachel_ with vigor and precision. Herr\r\nAlvary, who consented to take the part of _Prince Leopold_, with Herr\r\nPerotti as _Eleazar_, and the excellent support of the other singers,\r\nmade the production the best that has ever been given in New York, and\r\none long to be remembered. Frau Schroeder-Hanfstaengl has returned\r\nafter an absence of four years, making her reappearance in the modest\r\npart of _Bertha_ in \"Le Prophète.\"\r\n\r\nManager Frohman promises us a number of new American plays for next\r\nseason, which, he says, will be as good as those now produced abroad.\r\nMr. Louis Aldrich, by the way, has been restrained from using the name\r\nor the funds of the Actors' Order of Friendship in furtherance of his\r\nungenerous attempt to exclude foreign actors. A sad scene was that of\r\nthe sale of the late Lester Wallack's stage costumes. Scarcely a dozen\r\nof the actor's old friends were present, and the various garments were\r\nsold at ridiculously cheap prices, the greater part to dealers in old\r\nclothes! _Sic transit gloria mundi._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_REVIEWS._\r\n\r\n\r\n_The American Commonwealth_, by James Bryce (Macmillan & Co.).--The\r\nthoughtful citizen of the United States who opens this book from any\r\nother motive than mere curiosity will be apt to close it again greatly\r\ndisappointed. So far as information is concerned, one might as well\r\nread a debate of the Senate. If it is from curiosity as to what an\r\nEnglishman of Professor Bryce's ability and culture may think and say\r\nof us that the work is read, then the work will be found of interest.\r\nIt is so rare for one of Britain's citizens, cultured or uncultured,\r\nto care for us, that the novelty alone commands attention. It was\r\nsurly old Sam Johnson who said to a feminine owner of a parrot, in\r\nreply to her query as to whether the loquacious bird did not talk\r\nwell, \"Madam, the wonder is, not that it talks well, but that it talks\r\nat all.\" This great American nation is an object of utter indifference\r\nto the people of Europe; and among the so-called upper classes we are\r\nunder contempt, when noticed, from the rising of the sun to the\r\nsetting thereof.\r\n\r\nProfessor Bryce writes of us in a flattering way, but without\r\ninformation. The maze of contradiction that besets him on all sides\r\nseems not to have even embarrassed, let alone discouraged, him. Like a\r\nlocomotive threading its way along a network of rails into a depot, he\r\nhas his own track and runs smoothly along, as if there were but one,\r\nand quite regardless of the many others crossing and recrossing at\r\nevery rod of progress. Fixing one eye on the central government at\r\nWashington and the other on the State governments, he treats us as a\r\npeople from these two points, and would doubtless be amazed to learn\r\nthat these political structures not only do not make our government,\r\nbut are so widely separated from our associations and interests that\r\nthey might be annihilated to-day without people being aware of their\r\nloss, save from the relief of taxation found in their destruction.\r\n\r\nOne can comprehend the consternation of foreigners at this bold\r\nassertion, when we recognize the fact that its avowal will bring forth\r\nnot only denial, but an expression of disgust from about sixty-five\r\nmillions of citizens born under and naturalized to this republic of\r\nours. Yet it is truth; and to comprehend it we must remember that a\r\nconstitution is an agreement or compact, entered into directly or\r\nindirectly by the citizens governed, whereby all legislation,\r\nexecutive control, and judicial decisions are to be under the control\r\nof, and bound and limited by, certain rules of a general nature\r\nclearly stated and set forth in said instrument. Now as the trouble\r\nattending constitutional law, as that of every other sort, is not in\r\nthe law itself, but in its application, the constitution, to be at all\r\navailable, has to be as simple, general, and limited as possible. The\r\nmost perfect and practical is a mere declaration of principles that\r\nleaves all legislation to the wants, habits, and intelligence of the\r\npeople. As statutory law is merely public opinion defined and\r\npromulgated by a legislature, it follows that the mere declaration of\r\nrights found in a charter is continually infringed upon by what may be\r\ncalled the unwritten constitution that grows imperceptibly about us,\r\nand is in the end the controlling constitution. Let us give a familiar\r\nillustration. There is nothing, for example, in our Constitution that\r\nprohibits the people from re-electing a President as often as the\r\npeople see right to indulge in that process. Yet when ex-President\r\nGrant saw fit to demand a third term, he was treated as if he were\r\nviolating the sacred charter given us by the fathers.\r\n\r\nWe believe in our Constitution--and go on violating its plainest\r\nprovisions with utter indifference. We resemble that Southern\r\ngentleman who had the Lord's Prayer printed on the head-board of his\r\nbed, and who every night and morning rapped on it with his cane to\r\ncall attention to the ceremony, and said solemnly, \"O Lord, them's my\r\nsentiments.\"\r\n\r\nWe are a nation of phrase-eaters. As we have said before, all the\r\nfruit of the tree of knowledge has been canned--duly labelled and\r\nstowed away for winter use. There is no people on the face of the\r\nearth so given to a reliance on an abiding faith in dogmas. Our safety\r\non earth and our salvation hereafter rest on a belief in dogmas. As a\r\nman may be guilty of every crime known to the criminal code and yet\r\nsave his election through an avowal of belief in certain articles of\r\nfaith, so we may consider ourselves safe if we abide by certain\r\ndeclarations of political principles. The theological and political\r\navowals of faith may be violated with impunity in practice, yet there\r\nis a saving grace in words we fail to appreciate.\r\n\r\nThe origin of this strange condition is not difficult to find. Our\r\ncontinent was settled from Europe by two classes. One of these, the\r\nPuritans, fled from England to escape religious persecution. This\r\npersecution consisted in forbidding the theological rebels from\r\nopenly expressing in prayer, hymn, or pulpit certain dogmas. They\r\nbraved the perils of the seas and the privations of a howling\r\nwilderness that they might open their pious mouths and expand their\r\npious lungs in a vociferous announcement of what they believed of\r\nabstract theology. The other class was made up of pirates who sought\r\nour continent, mainly south, in search of gold-mines and mythical\r\nriches in the hands of barbarians. And so between the two we became a\r\nrace of phrase-eaters. As the theological dogma was considered good\r\nfor the soul, a like political dogma was, and is, enough for the body\r\npolitic. And how this is acted on we learn from the beginning. The\r\nPuritans, whose peculiar civilization dominated our nation, fled from\r\npersecution, not to establish toleration--for they went to hanging\r\nQuakers and Dissenters as soon as they landed in New England. Under\r\nthis sort of government the lawless spirit of the pirates had full\r\nsway, and to-day, if we have a national characteristic, it is that we\r\nhave more law and less order than any people on earth.\r\n\r\nThis condition makes us capable of the most extraordinary\r\ncontradictions. We have, for example, a so-called republic at\r\nWashington that is practically a despotism. It is not the despotism of\r\none man or of an oligarchy of men. It is a singularly contrived\r\ndespotism of office--a bureaucracy that is not only of an\r\nirresponsible routine without brains, but enforced by fines,\r\npenalties, and heavy taxation. It is so removed from popular control\r\nthat self-government terminates at the boundary-line of the District\r\nof Columbia. The people living under the very shadow of the Capitol\r\nare deprived of even the form of government; but practically they are\r\nin no worse condition than the citizens of the States. The so-called\r\nrepublic is a heavy, dull, cast-iron, unimpressive concern, slowly\r\nmoved by public opinion, but utterly insensible to popular political\r\ncontrol. We have a President elected every four years. After he is\r\ninaugurated he cannot be disturbed for four years except by\r\noffice-seekers or assassination. We have a Senate representing States,\r\nwhere Delaware or Rhode Island has as much power as New York or\r\nPennsylvania, and its members are returned every six years. The House\r\nof Representatives is the one popular body, but its members, returned\r\nevery two years, are no match for the Senate and Executive, that hold\r\nthe political patronage which makes and unmakes members of the House.\r\n\r\nThis, in brief, is our condition politically. There is another\r\nsignificant feature that escapes both native and foreign attention. It\r\nis the theory that underlies the foundation of all, and teaches that\r\nthe sovereignty from which there is no appeal rests in the people.\r\nThis is a very loose, uncertain, and really helpless affair. The old\r\nadage tells us that what is every man's affair is no man's business.\r\nWe have so multiplied elections that they are almost continuous. This\r\nforms party organization, to which the business is intrusted, and\r\nagain creates a class of professional politicians whose one business\r\nin life is politics. It is human nature that they should seek to make\r\ntheir vocation profitable. Here is where money enters; and we have\r\nseen the government pass from a mere political structure to a\r\ncommercial machine dominated by money. The taxes for the support of\r\nthe government have become enormous, but they make but a trifle to the\r\nindirect extortion, based on a pretence of encouraging home\r\nindustries, which selects such certain unprofitable investments, and\r\ntaxes the entire population for not only their support but their\r\nenrichment. The amount thus collected for the benefit of the few is\r\nenormous. It would support the standing armies of all Europe.\r\n\r\nOne searches in vain through the Constitution to find in letter or\r\nspirit any authority for such abuse.\r\n\r\nThis absurd system of government might work in a small, compact\r\ncommunity where all the citizens were known to each other, their\r\noffices few, and their interests identical. But with sixty-odd\r\nmillions scattered over a continent that reaches from the Atlantic to\r\nthe Pacific, and from the Lakes to the Gulf, and with these millions\r\nisolated from each other in agricultural pursuits, the system is\r\nimpossible of practical operation.\r\n\r\nThis is the philosophy of American politics that Professor Bryce fails\r\nto grasp. He devotes his first volume to a consideration of the\r\npolitical structure as given us by its framers, as if such were in\r\npower and daily practice. He cannot see that it has gone out of\r\nexistence as a constitutional government. We have in its stead a\r\ngovernment of corporations, with the political machine as an annex and\r\naid.\r\n\r\nTo understand this we must remember that a government is that active\r\norganization which directly affects the citizens' rights to life,\r\nliberty, and the uses and benefits of their labor, called property by\r\nsome, and \"the pursuit of happiness\" by the Declaration of\r\nIndependence. How the corporations have come to usurp this power a few\r\nstatistical facts teach us. We have, for example, a hundred-and-sixty\r\nthousand miles of operating railroads. These network the entire land,\r\nand have the almost exclusive distribution of all our products. This\r\nvast instrument, possessed of sovereignty through the franchise,\r\nenters every man's business and pleasure. It is under the control and\r\nvirtual ownership of less than sixty families.\r\n\r\nWe have the telegraph, which science gave us as the poor man's\r\npost-office, consisting as it does of a pole, a wire, a battery, and a\r\nboy, made a luxury for the rich in the monopoly that gives it to one\r\nman.\r\n\r\nAll that one eats, wears, and finds shelter under are, through this\r\nsame process of corporation monopoly, enhanced in cost for the benefit\r\nof the few privileged men who grow rapidly into millionaires, while\r\nthe masses suffer.\r\n\r\nThis is our government.\r\n\r\nOur readers must not charge us with exaggeration. We have statistics,\r\nnot to be disputed, as to the existence of the power, and we have high\r\nauthority for the charge regarding the despotic use of the power.\r\nSpeaking of the railroad corporations, Messrs. Conkling, Sherman, and\r\nWindom said, years since, in their celebrated report to the Senate:\r\n\"They [the railroad companies] can tax our products at will in a way\r\nCongress never dare attempt.\" Now the fiscal agency found in the power\r\nto tax is the highest attribute of sovereignty. Because of the\r\nusurpation in a British parliament accomplished in the attempt to tax\r\ncolonies of Americans without their consent we had the War of\r\nIndependence. Our fathers marched shoeless, tentless, and in rags\r\nunder muskets for seven years to vindicate a principle that we\r\nsurrender to the corporations. \"They rise above all control, and are a\r\nlaw unto themselves,\" said President Garfield. \"They rob the producers\r\non one side and the stockholders on the other,\" cried the late\r\nJeremiah S. Black, \"and sit on our highways of commerce as did the\r\nrobber barons on the rivers of Europe. They make members of the House,\r\npurchase seats in the Senate, select for us candidates for the\r\nPresidency, and own our courts.\"\r\n\r\nAnother attribute of sovereignty, found in furnishing a currency for\r\nthe people, has been seized on by something over two thousand\r\ncorporations, called banks, and they can contract or expand to further\r\ntheir own selfish greed or that of their favorites and dependents. For\r\nthus favoring themselves they are paid a sum that would have supported\r\nthe national government previous to the late war.\r\n\r\nHow this condition affects us every citizen can realize if he will\r\nreflect. The writer of this lives in a quiet valley of Ohio. He never\r\nwould know that a political government exists except for the assessor\r\nand collector. His police consists of a revolver, a shot-gun, and four\r\ndogs. Wrong-doers may threaten his life, restrain his liberty, enter\r\nhis stables at night, or his house at any hour, and, so far as\r\ngovernment goes, he is his own police.\r\n\r\nSo much for our political structure. How is it with the corporations?\r\nThey are with him at all hours. He cannot sell a grain of wheat nor an\r\nounce of meat without their consent and toll. The fuel he burns has\r\nits toll, that is an extortion. The clothes he wears, the food he\r\neats, the oil he burns by night, the glass that gives him light by\r\nday, the walls that shelter him, the shingles or slate upon the\r\nroof--in a word, all that he has to purchase or use, pays an\r\nuncalled-for tribute to extortion and monopoly.\r\n\r\nThe political structure could be annihilated, and the citizen would\r\nnot know of its disappearance but for the absence of assessor and\r\ncollector, and for the fact learned from the press.\r\n\r\nThis is the condition of the dweller in a rural district. The denizen\r\nof a town is not much better off. If he comes in contact with the\r\npolitical structure at any point, it is to his injury. He is taxed\r\nenormously to drain, pave, and light the streets. The draining is a\r\nsource of peril to health, the pavements are infamous, while the light\r\nonly makes darkness visible. So far as the police is concerned, it is\r\na political body, organized and used to further the ends of\r\nprofessional politicians. The citizen is in more peril from the\r\nclub-inclined police than he is from thieves and ruffians.\r\n\r\nA most startling illustration of the subserviency of the political\r\npower to the moneyed combinations incorporated to ride, booted and\r\nspurred, over popular rights, as Jefferson expressed it, was given by\r\nthe late tramway strikes at New York. When the conductors and drivers\r\nthrew up their employment because of the starvation wages and overwork\r\ndecreed by the combine, thereby putting a stop to all transportation,\r\ninstead of arresting the presidents and directors, and fetching them\r\ninto court to show cause why their charter should not be taken from\r\nthem for a failure to fulfil their duty to the public, the entire\r\npolice force was taken from duty to the public and put under control\r\nof these corporations. The rebellious laborers were clubbed into\r\nsubmission, while for a week New-Yorkers were forced either to walk or\r\nto trust their necks to those artfully constructed death-traps called\r\nthe elevated roads.\r\n\r\nWe are not siding in this one way or the other. It may be that the\r\nlaborers were all in the wrong and the corporations right, or the case\r\nmay have been the reverse. To decide this is precisely what we want in\r\na legal tribunal commanding the respect of the public. This is not to\r\nbe had. The policeman's club is in the pay and under the control of\r\nthe corporations, and it decides.\r\n\r\nAll these comments will be decried as unpatriotic. Patriotism with us\r\nis something akin to the love a mother has for a sick or crippled\r\nchild. We are like beggars on the highways of the world, exhibiting\r\nour sores to excite, not pity, but--heaven save the mark!--admiration.\r\nOf course we cannot be expected to cure cancers that we boast of.\r\n\r\nIn the space allotted us for a review it is impossible to do justice\r\nto Professor Bryce's entertaining ignorance. His book is an amusing\r\none, not only because the author is clever in his way of expressing\r\nhimself, but because we take a strange delight in hearing opinions\r\nabout ourselves and our institutions. In his first introductory\r\nsentences the author says: \"'What do you think of our institutions?'\r\nis the question addressed to the European traveller in the United\r\nStates by every chance acquaintance.\" The citizen who puts this\r\nquestion little notes that he is making confession of the melancholy\r\nfact that our so-called \"institutions\" are open to doubt. It is not\r\ncomplimentary to our national character that we hang with breathless\r\ninterest upon the opinion and judgment of any chance foreigner\r\nregarding what we are wont to assert, among ourselves, is simply\r\nperfect.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Kady_, by Patience Stapleton (Belford, Clarke & Co.).--The fetid\r\nrealism of recent American fiction--the realism which, fortunately for\r\nthe honor of human nature, is wholly unreal--has become fatally\r\ntiresome from persistent reiteration of one theme. Even the most\r\nmorbid readers must in time weary of an endless sequence of\r\nimmoralities, all of the same family, and all whitened with the scales\r\nof the same moral leprosy. When the Saxon mind descends to sensualism\r\nit becomes merely gross and brutish; for it lacks the airy\r\nsprightliness of Latin licentiousness which turns evil to gayety and\r\ncompels a smile at the corners of the mouth, even while the forehead\r\ncorrugates into the frown of reprobation. American blood is\r\nessentially moral, and when overheated becomes clogged and thickened,\r\nproducing the antic vagaries of delirium in the oppressed brain. An\r\nAmerican cannot be _just a little_ wicked, as a Frenchman can. He must\r\nbe sound-hearted and clean-thoughted, or he must throw off all\r\npretence to decency and descend into the sheer obscene. This is why\r\nAmerican erotic fiction is hysterically immoral and not delicately\r\nsuggestive, and why, instead of the filmy _double entendre_, which you\r\ncan innocently laugh at for its wit, or, with more hardihood, enjoy\r\nfor its tingling spice, we have the bald, unclothed picture, whose\r\nfiery coloring and sharp outline leave no chance for doubt as to its\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\nWhen this order of fiction was flung, naked and ogling, into the midst\r\nof an astonished public, there was a gasp of surprise and a general\r\nhalt of indecision; while, like the monkey burned with hot molasses\r\ncandy, the common countenance was petrified into a curious mixture of\r\nhorror and delight. Like a hanging, a dissection, or the details of a\r\nmurder, it has presented a fascination for a large number of minds;\r\nbut if there were to be a man hanged every day in each of the city\r\nsquares, it would not be long before people passing by would say to\r\neach other, \"Pooh! only a hanging! revolting business anyway!\" and\r\nwalk on without so much as a second glance. And so it is, or is\r\ngetting to be, with that class of fiction which has only the erotic\r\nfor its cause of being. When volume after volume, issuing from the\r\npress, offers as a central point and motive a microscopic analysis of\r\nthe animal side of human nature, taking for text that all men are\r\nlibidinous and all women unchaste in various degrees, the ordinary\r\nreader, seeking merely for amusement, at length finds himself\r\nsuffocated in the steam of moral turpitude, and craves for a breath of\r\npurer, cleaner air. Such an atmosphere, cold, fresh, and bracing as\r\nthe winds which blow over the mountain region where its scene is\r\nchiefly laid, surrounds this sweetest and most delightful of recent\r\nnovels, \"Kady.\"\r\n\r\n\"Kady\" is the work of a mind at once refined and vigorous. The author\r\nlabors at the exposition of no trite moral. There is not a line of\r\npreaching in the book, and yet it would be a hardened nature which\r\ncould rise from reading it, with his heart full of the simple nobility\r\nof Abner Clark, and commit a mean action. To recognize the reality of\r\nsuch a character as that of the old pioneer, simple, uneducated, and\r\nrude, yet, in the inborn impulses of his nature, nobly delicate,\r\nloftily honorable, good in the best and manliest sense--to recognize\r\nthat such men have lived and do live, is to put aside into the limbo\r\nof the vacuous all philosophies of negation and sophistries of\r\npessimism. Abner Clark is unquestionably one of the few grand\r\ncreations of American fiction. He is religious, but his religion is\r\nsuch that an infidel might respect it. It is the broad and simple\r\ncreed of love--love, with its concomitants of charity, forgiveness,\r\nand wide sympathy. The simple prayer which he offers up over the grave\r\nof the artist Harrison's mother is a masterpiece. \"An' we who must\r\nkeep on in the round of toil and trouble need not wish her back, who\r\nwas so weary with work and pain. The hand that reared these mount'ins,\r\nthat laid the lake, that colors the sunset sky, is reached down to\r\nhuman creeturs, to the weakest or the strongest, and takes them into\r\nHis keepin'. There's a dreary life here and a happy life hereafter;\r\n... and there's a home for us all beyond these mount'ins tall.\"\r\n\r\nIt is the religion of nature, the simple faith of the patriarchs of\r\nold, the belief that finds its strongest support in a noble pantheism,\r\nin the love of the Creator's handiwork, in a perception of the\r\nOmnipotent in the marvellous grandeur of material beauty. And yet this\r\nold man is neither superstitious nor weak. In order to save his young\r\nson from moral ruin and the clutches of card-sharpers, he can drink\r\nand gamble--aye, and play a game of poker like a bunco-steerer, and\r\nbeat roguery before its very eyes. This game of poker, by the way, is\r\none of the gems of the book. How the author, whose refinement of mind\r\nand heart is visible in every line of the whole story, has been able\r\nto study such scenes and such personages as this poker-party and these\r\nborder roughs to such wonderful purpose, it is hard to understand. The\r\nwhole incident stands out with the stern light and shadow of Salvator.\r\nIt is almost brutal in its realism, but is touchingly relieved by the\r\nsimple remorse of the misguided son and the rugged nobility of his\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n\"I come here ternight ter save my boy an' teach him a lesson.... Now\r\ngit in the boat,\" said Abner, \"and I, a father of sixty, will row his\r\nson, a drunkard and a gambler, home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, father,\" sobbed the miserable boy, \"I--I never can forgive\r\nmyself! I will never touch cards again!\" At the shore his father laid\r\nhis hand on Seeley's shoulder. \"Seeley, I love ye too well to be mad\r\nwith ye, but try to take the decent road, an' foller it straight.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man's death in the pursuit of his duty, the single word,\r\n\"Forgive,\" to his weak and repentant son, the wild grief of his\r\ndaughter Kady, touch the very centre of true pathos. Kady herself,\r\npoor, loving, wild little Kady, half savage and true woman, is a\r\nbeautiful character. Greatly tempted, misunderstood, slandered, and\r\nneglected, she never, by one weak or wilful act, loses the entire\r\nsympathy of the reader. As truthful in her character of border heroine\r\nas M'liss, Kady is a much more touching and lovable creation, without\r\nthe occasional repulsive traits of Bret Harte's portraiture. As her\r\nfather is a true and noble gentleman, despite the accidents of birth\r\nand environment, so is his daughter, under her uncouth garb and rude\r\nspeech, a true and noble woman.\r\n\r\nClopper, with his serene optimism, Leddy, his wife, Miss Pinkham and\r\nthe cap-border, Levi Bean, Tilford Harrison the egotistical and\r\nself-persecuting artist with his miserable family, the Dennisons,\r\nLouisy and Emmeline, Madam Ferris, and Aunt Mary--a whole gallery of\r\nmasterly portraits, are all instinct with life, all painted from\r\nevident sittings of originals.\r\n\r\nIf there be any marked defect in the book it is in the excess of\r\ndialect and the thinness of the background of more cultivated life. It\r\nis much to say that this book, whose style is chiefly dialect, rarely\r\nceases to charm and never tires. The author, whose pen has so long run\r\nin the uncouth speech of this border district, occasionally forgets\r\nher own English and drops a rude construction of sentence, or a\r\nprimitive term into her own lucid phrases. But these slips are rare,\r\nand it is almost hypercriticism to notice them.\r\n\r\nOn all accounts \"Kady\" is one of the most remarkable books of the\r\ntime. Purely American, without one taint of animalism though dealing\r\nwith the most primitive humanity, true, sweet, and yet masculine in\r\nits power, it is a work which will take its place in the literature of\r\nthe country as a model which cannot be too closely studied or too much\r\nadmired.\r\n\r\n\r\n_'Twixt Love and Law_: A novel, by Annie Jenness Miller (Belford,\r\nClarke & Co.).--Literature which neither refreshes, amuses, nor\r\ninstructs has no proper place in the world of letters; and assuredly\r\nthat class of literature which enervates the mind and beckons beyond\r\nthe noon-mark of propriety has no rights which the critic or the\r\nmoralist is bound to respect. It is a marked characteristic of that\r\norder of recent fiction which takes for text the more or less unlawful\r\nrelations of the sexes, that the style should be punctuated with\r\nshrieks, and the movement be a series of hysterical writhings. A woman\r\nwith keen feelings does not, at every small anticlimax of her\r\nexistence, perform a hand-spring and somersault as a means of giving\r\nvent to her emotions. Neither does she go about with a nose reddened\r\nwith weeping, exploding in vociferous adjectives as a means of\r\nexpressing her grief. \"To be always and everywhere starved! starved!\r\nstarved!\" wails Mrs. Miller's heroine, as a sort of footnote to a\r\nproposal of marriage which she has just declined. \"Oh, how cruel it\r\nis!\" Thereupon \"she shivered in the clutch of her despair, and,\r\nmoaning, threw herself face downward upon the bosom of Mother Earth,\"\r\nvery much to the amaze of the rejected suitor, who promptly picks her\r\nup and \"holds her against his breast.\" She is intense, superlatively\r\nintense. \"Her white bosom tossed and rose and fell; the burnished\r\nmasses of her hair escaped and rioted on the midnight air. 'Spare me!\r\nspare me! Alex! Alex! Alex!' Out of the unyielding density of the\r\nnight a voice of ecstasy breathed her name.\" A meeting takes place in\r\nthis \"unyielding density\" with \"Alex,\" a married man. The heroine\r\nbeing in love with him and he with her, it follows as a necessary\r\nelement in this class of fiction that the wife should be all that is\r\nmean, evil, shrewish, and generally detestable. In such a state of\r\naffairs a wife is a difficult problem, a nuisance, and yet very\r\nuseful; for if there were no wife to interpose her uncomfortable\r\npersonality between the lovers, there would be no reason for all these\r\nmeetings in the \"unyielding density,\" no exclamatory passages, no\r\ndaring escapades along the very verge of the questionable, and, hence,\r\nno novel--which, all things considered, might not be so great a\r\nmisfortune after all. In the course of this story, which includes much\r\noutcry, many combats with tempestuous passion, some sacrifices, a\r\ntrial for attempted murder, and a divorce, the unpleasant marital\r\nimpediment is comfortably put out of the way, and the lovers are\r\nsafely married.\r\n\r\n\"'Twixt Love and Law\" is one of those books, \"not wicked, but unwise,\"\r\nwhich, whatever their ostensible moral may be, add to the perplexity\r\nand difficulty of social adjustment. Admitting that our marriage and\r\ndivorce laws are unjust and ineffectual, still, to bring contempt,\r\nopen or implied, upon the marriage relation, can only impede, not\r\nadvance, a rational solution of the question. In nine cases out of ten\r\nvanity and loose morals are the primary causes of marital\r\nunfaithfulness in desire or act. In writing such a book as \"'Twixt\r\nLove and Law,\" clever and often brilliant as it is, the author has not\r\nused her graceful pen and clear head to the best interests of her sex.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE APPEAL._\r\n\r\n\r\n    Cold, bitter cold beneath the wild March moon,\r\n      The winter snow lies on my frozen breast;\r\n    And o'er my head the cypress branches croon\r\n      A sad and ceaseless dirge, and break my rest.\r\n\r\n    I hear the bell chime in the dark church tower,\r\n      The rising wind, a passer's hasty tread;\r\n    But no voice wakes the silence, hour by hour,\r\n      Among the uncompanionable dead.\r\n\r\n    Perchance they lie in deep, unconscious calm,\r\n      Regretting nothing in the world above;\r\n    Alas! for me it has not lost its charm--\r\n      There is no peace where thou art not, my love!\r\n\r\n    Oh! bid me come to thee, and I will rise\r\n      From my unquiet couch and steal to thine,\r\n    And touch thy cheek, and kiss thy sleeping eyes,\r\n      And clasp thee, as of old, till morning shine!\r\n\r\n    And I will murmur in thy drowsy ears\r\n      Sweet utterances of love and olden song,\r\n    Till thou shalt half awake in blissful tears,\r\n      And cry \"My love, why hast thou staid so long?\"\r\n\r\n                                        CHARLES LOTIN HILDRETH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA COVENANT WITH DEATH.[1]\r\n\r\n_A NARRATIVE._\r\n\r\nBY THE AUTHOR OF \"AN UNLAID GHOST.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    To E. P. T.\r\n    \"So little payment for so great a debt.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n    \"O Death in Life! the days that are no more.\"\r\n\r\nIt would have been no surprise to his friends had Loyd Morton speedily\r\nfollowed his young wife to the grave. Their brief union had been a\r\nvery communion of souls--one of those rare experiences in wedlock for\r\njealousy of which Destiny may almost be pardoned. Small wonder,\r\ntherefore, that his grief was of that speechless description which\r\n\"whispers the o'er-fraught heart, and bids it break.\" For a time it\r\nwas thought he could not survive his dumb despair; or, if he did, that\r\nmelancholia would claim him an easy victim. It is needless to affirm\r\nthat he escaped the wreck of both life and reason, since the existence\r\nof this chronicle attests so much.\r\n\r\nThe manner of his escape does not appear; though it was astutely\r\nsurmised, and perhaps with some show of probability, that, being an\r\nexpert and practitioner in disorders of the nervous system, he healed\r\nhimself, albeit physicians of experience may entertain contrary views\r\nconcerning the feasibility of the feat. At all events, he came forth\r\nto face his world again, a sad, pallid being indued with indomitable\r\nperseverance and fortitude; more than ever zealous in the discharge of\r\nhis engagements; as never before devoted to his profession. But a\r\nsympathetic eye could not fail to detect the feverish abandonment of\r\nself, the positively voracious hungering for constant activity, which\r\nwere in themselves a pathetic commentary upon the frame of mind in\r\nwhich his bereavement had left him.\r\n\r\nHe had become the wraith-like semblance of the original young Doctor\r\nMorton, once so buoyant, so pampered by favoring Fate--in a word, so\r\nworthy of righteous envy. Alas! what eternities to him were those\r\nhours of lonely seclusion when there were no visits to pay and no\r\nclients to awaken the sepulchral echoes of his house with summons at\r\nthe bell--dark hours of nothingness, blank eras of forlorn distress!\r\n\r\nYet, let there be no suspicion that Loyd Morton's was an unmanly\r\ngrief; it was no more a lachrymose distemper than it was a stubborn\r\nsetting of his face against his lot. His sorrow was far too genuine to\r\nbe self-conscious, and, if he brooded in his despair, it was simply\r\nbecause something had gone out of his life infinitely more precious\r\nthan life itself; something that he would have given his life to\r\nrecover, since absolute annihilation seemed to him preferable to this\r\nexisting condition of death in life.\r\n\r\nHis love had been a first, all-absorbing passion; it had introduced\r\ninto his hitherto prosaic existence a light and genial warmth that had\r\nset the soft glow of the rose upon its humblest attributes; it had\r\nafforded him an object to live for, a goal worthy his ambition, and\r\nhad filled the void of indefinable longing with that sense of\r\ncompleteness which is ever the result of a perfect alliance between\r\nsympathy and sincerity of purpose.\r\n\r\nHe had met his affinity during his student-days; had wooed, and won,\r\nand married her in the first flush of that youthful affection.\r\nPossibly the old-time shades of Stuttgart lent a quaint and\r\nfascinating glamour to the courtship; but, if glamour there were, it\r\nbecame the permanent atmosphere that hallowed their marital relations\r\nwhen the work of life began at home, stripped of all romantic\r\nassociation. Indeed, their honeymoon never waned to setting; it simply\r\nsuffered total eclipse.\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate that, at the period of his overwhelming bereavement,\r\nthe young physician chanced to be in vogue. American nervous systems\r\nare notoriously more subject to disorder than any on the face of the\r\nearth; and he who ministers successfully to, or rather deciphers\r\ncleverly, these occult riddles of the human anatomy of the West, is\r\nnot only an exceedingly busy, but an eminently fortunate, man. Day and\r\nnight he is at the beck and call of those whose unstrung nerves\r\nrequire tuning; while, if his patience is forced to pay the penalty of\r\nhis devotion, the shade of Midas, by way of recompense, seems\r\nindefatigable in its superintendence of the filling of his coffers.\r\n\r\nTo repute and popularity had Loyd Morton attained in an exceptional\r\ndegree; and, for the reason that a host of wayward nervous systems\r\ncould not be induced to respect the season of his grief, he was fairly\r\ndragged out of his seclusion, and made to identify himself with the\r\nreal or imaginary woes of his patients. And it was fortunate that it\r\nwas so, since on this account, only in the solitude of those chambers,\r\nabout which clung the memory of his lost one like a benison, had he\r\nopportunity to listen to the lament of his anguished heart. And the\r\nmonotonous cry of that heart was ever, \"Paula, Paula, Paula! My wife!\"\r\n\r\nSurely there could have been no rest for her soul if that wail of\r\naffliction penetrated the celestial sphere to the enjoyment of which\r\nher blameless life entitled her. Far from contributing to her repose,\r\nsuch grieving emphasis must have fettered her spirit to earth.\r\n\r\n\"I feel,\" he told himself at the close of his first year of widowhood,\r\n\"as though I was environed by a sere wilderness, over whose trackless\r\nwastes I must trudge until I meet the ashy horizon and find the end.\r\nNo ray of light, no star to twinkle hope; always these weeping clouds\r\nof grizzled pallor! Only one comfort is vouchsafed me--fatigue.\r\nFortunately, fatigue means sleep, and sleep oblivion!\"\r\n\r\nLost in dreary revery, he sat by the window of his study one April\r\nevening, with the melancholy spring-tide gloaming about him. A\r\nnesting-bird twittered, and the scent of the sodden earth filtered in\r\nat the half-open casement.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago that day he had watched a German mother raise the bridal\r\nwreath from her daughter's brow, the happy ceremonial over, and had\r\nlistened, as in a rapturous dream, to the words: \"She is thine. Take\r\nher; but, oh! my son, guard, guide, and cherish her, for the sake of\r\nher fond mother, when the boundless sea shall roll between us!\"\r\n\r\nOne year agone to an hour, and in the dismal after-glow of a rainy\r\nsunset, he had stood beside the open grave, his agonized heart-throbs\r\nechoing the wet clods as they fell upon the casket that contained the\r\nlast fragment of his shattered hopes--his broken idol screened from\r\nhis yearning gaze by hideous glint of plate and polished wood.\r\n\r\nNuptial and burial rites celebrated with the self-same ghastly flowers\r\nwithin a twelve-month! A wreath for a bride, a chaplet for a corpse,\r\nfragrant tokens for the quick and the dead--and so the chapter ended!\r\n\r\nThe monotonous drip of the eaves, the fitful sough of the miasmatic\r\nwind, the odor of the humid garden-plot, the blood-red hem of the\r\nleaden clouds whose skirts trailed languidly along the western\r\nhorizon--all, all so vividly recalled that grievous hour of sepulture,\r\nso painfully accentuated its anniversary, that, in very desolation of\r\nsoul, he exclaimed,\r\n\r\n\"My God! how unutterably lonely and wretched I am! What would I not\r\ngive for one word, one glimpse, for the slightest assurance that we\r\nare not doomed to eternal separation; that the closing of the eyes in\r\ndeath does not signify instant annihilation!\"\r\n\r\nThe sudden clang of the office-bell interrupted his utterance and\r\nalmost deprived him of breath, so significant seemed the punctuation\r\nto his thought. He rose hastily and, contrary to his custom, preceded\r\nthe servant through the hall.\r\n\r\nUpon throwing open the outer door, he found himself confronted by a\r\nwoman, closely veiled and clothed in black, her tall and slender\r\nfigure standing forth in strong relief against the lurid gloom of the\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nFor an instant silence prevailed, save for the retreating footsteps of\r\nthe servant as he returned to his quarters.\r\n\r\n\"You are Doctor Loyd Morton,\" the woman began in a tone low yet\r\nperfectly distinct, a tone of assertion rather than inquiry. \"Can you\r\ngive me a few moments' consultation?\"\r\n\r\n\"These are my office-hours, madam,\" he replied, a feeling of mingled\r\ncuriosity and repulsion taking possession of him.\r\n\r\n\"I know; but I am told that you are in great request. Shall we be\r\nundisturbed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so. Will you come in?\"\r\n\r\nHe stepped aside and she entered, raising her veil as she did so,\r\nthough the darkness of the hall prevented his determining what manner\r\nof countenance she wore. The twilight that penetrated the office\r\nthrough uncurtained windows, however, discovered a delicate, pale face\r\nframed in tendrils of soft chestnut hair and alight with eyes of the\r\nsame indescribable tint. It was not a strictly beautiful face,\r\naccording to the canons of beauty, yet it was one of those faces one\r\nglance at which invites another, until the spell of fascination claims\r\nthe beholder.\r\n\r\nLoyd Morton had had impressionable days, but for obvious reasons they\r\nwere at an end. Still, he was interested; and the better to study his\r\nvisitor he was about to strike a match for the purpose of lighting a\r\nlamp, when the woman, with swift divination of his intent, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"I prefer the twilight,\" adding; \"I shall not detain you long.\"\r\n\r\nMorton hesitatingly replaced the unignited match, and glanced at his\r\nvisitor in a manner eloquent of his desire to learn the object of her\r\ncall.\r\n\r\nShe noted the silent interrogation in her keen way, and, after a swift\r\nsurvey of the shadowy apartment, continued:\r\n\r\n\"I believe you assured me that we should be undisturbed.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did, madam.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are not alone, however.\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon; we are quite alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no! there is a presence here beside our own--a presence so real,\r\nso powerful, as to be almost tangible. Oh, I understand that look of\r\nquick intelligence in your eyes and that wan smile lurking about your\r\nlips. You think me deranged; but I can easily prove to you that I am\r\nnot.\"\r\n\r\nShe had spoken with unexpected fervor, and now paused, pressing her\r\nslender hand upon her eyes, as if to compose herself.\r\n\r\n\"I did not think to encounter one of my so-called crises here,\" she\r\nresumed presently; \"but it is just as well, since by this means you\r\ncan better form some diagnosis of my case. Do--do I afford you any\r\nhint? Perhaps, though, I do not interest you?\"\r\n\r\nHis unresponsive silence seemed to dispirit her, for her eager eyes\r\nfell dejectedly.\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary, you interest me very much,\" he answered gently.\r\n\"Will you be seated, and give me some information regarding your\r\nsymptoms?\"\r\n\r\nShe sank into the depths of a reclining-chair that faced the western\r\nwindow, while Morton seated himself directly before her.\r\n\r\nThe blood-red ribbon below the rainy clouds had faded and shrunk to a\r\nfilament of pale olive that gave forth a weird, crepuscular glimmer.\r\nObjects as white as the pallid face among the cushions seemed to\r\nabsorb the sensitive light and to grow yet more spectral through its\r\naid.\r\n\r\n\"First of all,\" remarked the young doctor, \"kindly give me your name\r\nand such information as you please concerning your manner of life.\"\r\n\r\nThe voice that replied was low to drowsiness.\r\n\r\n\"My name is Revaleon--Margaret Revaleon. I am an Englishwoman by\r\nbirth, and have been for three years the wife of a Canadian. Until my\r\nchild was born I enjoyed, if not robust, at least excellent, health.\r\nFor the past year I have lost ground; while these crises, as I call\r\nthem, have debilitated and depressed me. Thinking a change would\r\nbenefit me, I have come to visit friends in this neighborhood. In the\r\nhope of relief from my peculiar ailment, which I believe to be purely\r\nnervous, I have sought you out, attracted by your fame as an expert in\r\ndisorders of the nervous system. Ah, doctor,\" she added, struggling\r\nagainst the lethargy that oppressed her, \"do not tell me that I am\r\nincurable, since I have so much to live for!\"\r\n\r\nShe seemed as ingenuous as a child; her unaffected manner being such\r\nas speedily wins its way to confidence. The sense of mingled repulsion\r\nand curiosity, which in the first moment she had exerted upon Morton,\r\nvanished, giving place to a feeling of genuine interest, perhaps\r\nconcern.\r\n\r\n\"I see no reason for pronouncing the doom you dread, Mrs. Revaleon,\"\r\nhe said; \"not, at least, until you explain the 'peculiar ailment' you\r\nallude to.\"\r\n\r\nHer eyes rested upon him with singular intentness--singular, because\r\nthey appeared to lack speculation; that is to say, they were dilated,\r\nand luminous with a strange yellow light. At the same time it was\r\nevident that their regard was introspective, if speculative at all.\r\nYet her reply followed with a full consciousness of the situation.\r\n\r\n\"I am unable to explain my malady,\" she said. \"It consists in little\r\nmore than what you see at this moment. If _you_ cannot account for my\r\npresent condition, it must continue a mystery to me.\"\r\n\r\nHe leaned forward and took her hands in his. They were icy cold,\r\nalthough they responded to his touch with an indescribable, nervous\r\nvibration.\r\n\r\n\"I have no trouble of the heart,\" she murmured, divining his\r\nsuspicion; \"I suffer this lowering of vitality only when in my present\r\ncondition.\"\r\n\r\nHe released her hands and sat back in his chair, regarding her\r\nfixedly.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief pause, he remarked,\r\n\r\n\"I must ask you to explain what you mean by your 'present condition.'\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean, Dr. Morton, that, since you assure me that there is no\r\npresence in this room other than our own, I must possess some species\r\nof clairvoyance which my present condition induces. I assure you that\r\nthere _is a third presence here_, that completely overshadows you! The\r\nconsciousness of this fact freezes my very marrow and chills my being\r\nwith the chill of death. It is by no means the first time that I have\r\nexperienced these baleful sensations, or I should not have come to you\r\nfor advice and counsel. Heaven knows I have no wish to be cognizant of\r\nthese occult matters; but I am completely powerless to struggle\r\nagainst them. Ah, me!\" she sighed wearily, \"had I lived in the days of\r\nwitchcraft, I suppose I should have been burned at the stake, despite\r\nmy innocence.\"\r\n\r\nHer voice sank to a whisper, and with its cadence her eye-lids drooped\r\nand closed; her breathing became stertorous, while her teeth ground\r\neach other with an appalling suggestion of physical agony, of which\r\nher body gave no evidence, being quiescent.\r\n\r\nStartled though he was, Morton's first suspicion was that he was being\r\nmade the victim of some clever imposture. This fancy, however, soon\r\ngave place to a belief that he was witnessing some sort of refined\r\nhysteria. Were the latter supposition the case, he felt himself equal\r\nto the emergency.\r\n\r\nHe leaned forward and placed his hands firmly upon the shoulders of\r\nthe inanimate woman. \"Enough of this, Mrs. Revaleon!\" he exclaimed in\r\na firm voice; \"if I am to assist you, you must assist me! I command\r\nyou to open your eyes!\"\r\n\r\nNot so much as a nerve vibrated in the corpse-like figure.\r\n\r\nAroused to a determination to thoroughly investigate the phenomenon,\r\nMorton quickly ignited a candle, and, holding it in one hand, he\r\npassed it close to the woman's eyes, the heavy lids of which he\r\nalternately raised with the fingers of his disengaged hand.\r\n\r\nThe eyes returned a dull, sightless glare to the test.\r\n\r\nAs a last resort to arouse consciousness or discover imposture, he\r\nproduced a delicate lancet, and, raising the lace about the woman's\r\nwrist, he lightly scarified the cold, white flesh. Blood sluggishly\r\ntinged the slight abrasion, but, to his amazement, the immobility of\r\nhis subject failed to relax one jot; yet the experiment was not\r\nentirely without result, since at the same moment a voice, muffled and\r\nfar away in sound, broke the expectant silence:\r\n\r\n\"Loyd! Loyd!\"\r\n\r\nThe twilight had deepened to actual gloom, which the flickering of the\r\nweird candle-light but served to accentuate. It seemed impossible to\r\nestablish evidence to prove that it was the lips of Margaret Revaleon\r\nthat had framed the thrilling utterance; indeed, the eerie tone could\r\nbe likened to nothing human.\r\n\r\nSpellbound the young doctor stood, doubting the evidence of his\r\nsenses, yet listening--listening, until it came again, with positive\r\nenunciation and import,\r\n\r\n\"Loyd!\"\r\n\r\n\"In Heaven's name, who calls?\" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Paula, your wife.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n    \"We see but dimly through the mists and vapors;\r\n              Amid these earthly damps,\r\n    What seem to us but sad, funereal tapers\r\n              May be heaven's distant lamps.\"\r\n\r\nThough Loyd Morton had proved himself to be an ideal lover, he was at\r\nheart an eminently practical man. It is true he had not yet quite\r\noutlived that heyday of impressions that occurs somewhere in the first\r\ntwo score years of all lives. His eager mind grasped, with avidity,\r\nthe various tenets of his day, and strove to fathom them; if he failed\r\nin any instance, he chose that happy mean between scepticism and\r\npositive unbelief, and waited for more light. He felt that he had been\r\nborn into an epoch of rare progress, and that it behooved him to\r\nreject nothing worthy of intelligent consideration. There can be no\r\ndoubt that the abundant sentiment in his nature lent itself to the\r\nhigher phases of intellectual inquiry; yet, in justice, he could not\r\nbe called a visionary person--at least, prior to this particular April\r\nevening. It was but natural that, in the wide circle of his\r\nprofessional and social acquaintanceship he should have fallen in with\r\nmore than one disciple of the advanced theory of modern spiritualism.\r\nTo converse with all such, he lent a courteous, even interested, ear.\r\nHe found himself not infrequently listening in amazement to certain\r\nthrilling experiences related by the initiated, and, as a result, he\r\npromised himself the satisfaction of investigating the matter for\r\nhimself some day; but into his busy existence that day had not as yet\r\nfound its way. Consequently, he had formed no opinion whatever as\r\nregarded the so-called communion between the living and the dead. As\r\nhas been said, his interest in the question had been excited--more,\r\npossibly, than comported with the distinction of his professional\r\nposition; but it is doubtful if he would have rejected the\r\ninvestigation simply on this account.\r\n\r\nHere, however, was an instance fairly thrust upon him, which startled,\r\namazed, and mystified him. That the woman, Margaret Revaleon, was in a\r\nstate of complete coma, he had satisfied himself beyond peradventure.\r\nAccomplished physicians are not apt to be deceived regarding the\r\nresults of infallible tests; and yet here was a subject, absolutely\r\nunconscious, speaking not only intelligently, but with a degree of\r\nappositeness that, considering the circumstances, was appalling.\r\n\r\nThoroughly alive to the situation, not to say excited, yet\r\nsufficiently master of himself to keep well within the pale of\r\nscepticism, Morton resumed his seat, which he had quitted in some\r\nagitation when informed that he was face to face with the invisibility\r\nof his wife, and disposed himself to probe the mystery.\r\n\r\nMrs. Revaleon had ceased to breathe stertorously; a complacent, almost\r\nsmiling expression had taken possession of her features, and she had\r\nleaned forward in her chair, with outstretched hands, though her eyes\r\nremained closed.\r\n\r\n\"Give me your hands, Loyd,\" she said in the same murmurous tone, that\r\nretained not a vestige of her normal voice, \"will you not welcome me\r\nback?\"\r\n\r\nMorton relinquished his hands into the keeping of that cold clasp, in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n\"O Loyd, my husband,\" the voice resumed, \"can you not believe that it\r\nis I, Paula, your wife?\"\r\n\r\n\"What would be the consequence of my saying that I cannot believe?\" he\r\nresponded with constraint.\r\n\r\n\"It would make it all the more difficult for me to convince you that I\r\nam indeed with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I will _say_ that I believe.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am clairvoyant. You cannot mislead a spirit capable of reading your\r\nmind as though it were an open book. Ah, what can I do to conquer your\r\nincredulity? What can I say to convince you that I am as truly with\r\nyou at _this_ moment as I was at any moment while in the flesh? It is\r\nyour sacred love for me that has attracted my spirit to this\r\nfortuitous reunion. Oh, do not doubt me!--rather assist me, if ever\r\nyou loved me, Lolo!\"\r\n\r\nHe started then, and his dark eyes shone like twin stars. \"How came\r\n_you_ by that name?\" he demanded unsteadily--\"a name never uttered in\r\nthe presence of any living being, save myself?\"\r\n\r\n\"How came I by that endearing epithet!\" the voice answered. \"Did not\r\nmy absorbing fondness for you suggest it? Was it not the coinage of my\r\naffectionate fancy? I beseech you, separate this medium, through whom\r\nI speak, from my personality. Understand that this woman is\r\npractically dead, while it is I, Paula Morton, who actuate her brain,\r\nher voice, her very being.\"\r\n\r\n\"My God!\" exclaimed Morton, \"this is beyond my comprehension!\"\r\n\r\n\"Let perfect faith control you while this brief communion lasts; then\r\ntake refuge in scepticism--if you can. You are so unhappy, so\r\nwretched, without me, that I should think you would be glad to meet me\r\nmore than half way.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot see you, if it is you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Another question of faith! But it matters not; you will believe in\r\ntime. So you miss me?\"\r\n\r\n\"My life is a void without my wife,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"What divine love! Loyd, you and I constitute an affinity. I know\r\n_now_ how rare are earthly affinities; that is, unions of souls that\r\nare destined to endure through all eternity. Every soul born into\r\nexistence is allotted an affinity, which sooner or later it will meet,\r\nin accordance with divine ordinance. These unions of kindred souls,\r\nattuned, as they are, to surpassing harmony, are rare upon earth,\r\nthough they may occur, as in our case; but, generally, years--even\r\nages--may transpire ere these ineffable coalitions are consummated.\r\n_Our_ souls are affined; we have no need to search. We are simply\r\nundergoing a temporary separation. You are coming to me; I am waiting\r\nfor you. I rejoice in the thought, and the knowledge gives me strength\r\nto control this medium, who brings me into such intimate communion\r\nwith you.\"\r\n\r\nAt this juncture in the extraordinary interview, a bell rang\r\nviolently, and a moment later a light rap sounded upon the door, a\r\npreconcerted signal between the doctor and his servant, announcing the\r\nfact that another visitor demanded admittance.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that Morton was too deeply absorbed to notice the\r\nthreatening intrusion.\r\n\r\n\"If--if I thought,\" he said, his hesitation marking the intensity of\r\nhis emotion, \"if I suspected that I was being made the dupe of some\r\nplausible imposture, the butt of some sort of nameless sorcery, I--\"\r\n\r\n\"Loyd, Loyd,\" wailed the voice, \"you wrong me, wrong me grievously!\r\nYour incredulity dooms me to such unhappiness as I have never known.\"\r\n\r\n\"You imply that you have known some degree of unhappiness! You were\r\nnever unhappy upon earth; are you so now--wherever you may be?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no! I am supremely happy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Supremely happy,\" he echoed, jealously; \"supremely happy, though\r\nseparated from me! and yet you term your love for me divine!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is divine, divine as all things heavenly are. For the perfecting\r\nof such love as mine the evidence of the senses is not requisite;\r\nindeed, it would prove antagonistic. Your earthly eyes are blind; but\r\nfrom my vision have fallen away the scales, which fact renders my\r\nspiritual sight clairvoyant. I can see you at all times, and can be\r\nwith you with the celerity of the birth of thought. Where then, in\r\nwhat resides the separation for me?\"\r\n\r\n\"For _you_!\" he cried, passionately; \"ay, but for _me_! I am blind;\r\nthese mortal scales are upon my eyes, I am not clairvoyant. The wings\r\nof thought refuse to raise me above this present slough of despond\r\ninto which I have fallen; they flutter with me back among the memories\r\nof the dead past, but that is all! I am still living in the flesh, and\r\nheaven knows that this bitter separation is a reality to me!\"\r\n\r\nThereupon ensued a momentary silence, which was ere long ruptured by\r\nthe low, gentle voice.\r\n\r\n\"Loyd,\" it whispered, \"you bind me to earth; your love fetters my\r\nspirit!\"\r\n\r\n\"If your love were unchanged,\" he murmured, disconsolately, \"there\r\nwould be no bondage in such magnetism!\"\r\n\r\n\"My love, having been spiritualized, is far more absorbing than ever\r\nit was.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why should you complain that the attraction of my love binds you\r\nto earth? If it is the spirit of my wife that addresses me at this\r\nmoment, as you pretend, if your love for me is greater and purer than\r\nit was upon earth--which, as God is my judge, I can scarcely\r\ncredit--why should you not be happier in this sphere, where I am, than\r\nin the realm of heaven?\"\r\n\r\n\"Simply because it is not heaven here.\"\r\n\r\n\"But _I_ am here!\"\r\n\r\n\"For a time only, for a little space; and there is no reckoning of\r\ntime in eternity. Soon you will be with me--forever.\"\r\n\r\n\"Paula! Would I were with you now!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush! That wish is impious.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, but think! I have the means at my command to send my soul into\r\neternity, within the twinkling of an eye!\"\r\n\r\n\"Into eternity, but not to me. Oh, my husband, there is no sin\r\naccounted so heinous as the taking of a God-given life. You must live\r\non until your appointed hour, then come into the courts of heaven with\r\nhands unstained, with soul unsullied.\"\r\n\r\nRaised to a pinnacle of exaltation which, in his normal condition, he\r\nwould have deemed unattainable to one of his stanch rationality,\r\nMorton exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"I _cannot_ live without you! After what I have just heard, which\r\nrenders my dreary existence tenfold more dreary, I will not hold\r\nmyself responsible for what I may do. Oh, Paula, my wife, my wife! if\r\nyou would not have me commit a crime against myself which may separate\r\nus for all eternity, come back to me!\"\r\n\r\n\"I will come back to you,\" responded the voice.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I do not mean enveloped in this ghostly invisibility!\" he cried.\r\n\r\n\"No, Loyd, I will return to you in the flesh.\"\r\n\r\nSupreme as had been the moment of his supplication, he had retained\r\nsufficient reason not to expect a concession; consequently he felt\r\nthat he was taking leave of his wits as he gasped,\r\n\r\n\"You will return to me--_in the flesh_!\"\r\n\r\n\"In the flesh. Before the dawn of another day you shall take a living\r\nbody in your arms and know that it is animated by my soul.\"\r\n\r\nHis clasp tightened upon the hands he held.\r\n\r\n\"Am I mad? Do I hear aright?\" he faltered, his utterance thick with\r\nwonder; \"in God's name, _how_ will you effect such reincarnation?\"\r\n\r\nThere was a momentary pause; and then the voice replied with some note\r\nof omen in its firmness:\r\n\r\n\"Mark the test I am about to give to you! You will be called to attend\r\na dying woman--you _are_ called; already is the messenger here; a\r\nwoman's soul is trembling upon the threshold of eternity. If you are\r\nalone with her when that soul takes wing, my spirit will instantly\r\ntake its place, and your skill will do the rest, accomplish the\r\nresurrection of that body and secure our further communion. But there\r\nmay be consequences over which _I_ shall have no control; those\r\nconsequences _you_ will have to confront. Are you willing to accept\r\nthe chances?\"\r\n\r\n\"Willing! All I ask is the opportunity to meet them!\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well. You have conjured me back to earth. With you rests the\r\nresponsibility!\"\r\n\r\nThe voice expired in a sigh, and the hitherto quiescent figure of\r\nMargaret Revaleon shuddered, while her hands trembled convulsively.\r\nThereupon followed the stertorous breathing again, and the painful\r\ngnashing of the teeth. An instant later her great hazel eyes flashed\r\nopen, and rested with a sightless stare upon the flickering candle.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, where am I?\" she moaned languidly, her voice having retaken its\r\nnormal tone; then came a flash of intelligence like the nascent tremor\r\nof dawn; at last full consciousness of her surroundings.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, is it you, Doctor Morton?\" she faltered, smiling faintly; \"really\r\nI had forgotten you. Where have I been? What do you think of my case?\r\nIs it hopeless? By your grave look I infer it must be.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment the signal at the door was repeated more peremptorily.\r\n\r\nMorton gathered his energies with an effort.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me for a moment, Mrs. Revaleon,\" he stammered, with difficulty\r\ncommanding himself, \"I will return to you presently.\"\r\n\r\nWith a nervous step, quite at variance with his wonted calm demeanor,\r\nhe hastened into the ante-chamber, closing the door behind him.\r\n\r\nThe gas burned brightly, and its flare dazzled his sight accustomed to\r\nthe twilight that reigned within the study; but he was well able to\r\nrecognize the young gentleman who hastened forward at his approach.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Loyd!\" exclaimed the visitor, with an accent of mingled agony and\r\nreproach, \"what an eternity you have kept me waiting! In heaven's\r\nname, come to us at once! Romaine is dying!\"\r\n\r\n\"Romaine--dying!\" echoed Morton.\r\n\r\n\"We fear so; God grant that we may be mistaken! But will you come at\r\nonce?\"\r\n\r\n\"At once of course, Hubert.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then follow me; the carriage is waiting.\"\r\n\r\nThe young man had reached the door even as he spoke.\r\n\r\nMorton paused in the midst of the brilliantly lighted room, every\r\nvestige of color fled even from his lips.\r\n\r\n\"Merciful Powers!\" he murmured, \"am I waking from some hallowed dream\r\nor from some infernal nightmare? No, no! this is the test _she_ bid me\r\nmark! It is no fantasy! it is reality!\"\r\n\r\nEven in his haste he was mindful of his waiting client, and flung open\r\nthe door of his study. A sharp draught of air from the open casement\r\nextinguished the candle that burned within, leaving in its stead the\r\nlance of a pale young moon.\r\n\r\nBathed in the aqueous light stood Margaret Revaleon, regarding him\r\nwith wistful eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Well, doctor,\" she began, \"you have returned to pass sentence upon\r\nme?\"\r\n\r\n\"By no means, Mrs. Revaleon,\" he answered, hastily; \"I have only to\r\nsay that your case is a singular one. While I have no reason to\r\nbelieve that any real danger will ever result from the 'condition' of\r\nwhich you complain, I am forced to admit that I know of no treatment\r\nfor you at this time. I beg you to excuse me now, as I am called to\r\nattend a critical case. My servant will wait upon you.\"\r\n\r\nAnd with these hasty words, Morton took his departure.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n    \"Now help, ye charming spells and periapts!\"\r\n\r\nSir Francis Bacon maintained that every man is a debtor to his\r\nprofession, and that in seeking to receive countenance and profit\r\ntherefrom, he should of duty endeavor, by way of amends, to be a help\r\nand ornament thereunto. Undoubtedly every genuine professor realizes\r\nthis obligation; while if he be of a truly appreciative nature, he\r\nwill not lose sight of a concomitant duty towards those whose favor\r\nhas lent encouragement to the practice of his art or profession,\r\nespecially at the period of its incipience.\r\n\r\nSuch a debt of gratitude did young Doctor Loyd Morton owe the\r\nEffingham family.\r\n\r\nSidney Effingham had been a magnate in his day; a man who had freely\r\ngiven his distinguished influence towards the refinement of our, in\r\nsome respects, too rapid Republican growth, and he had gone down to the\r\ntomb of his ancestors, leaving behind him worthy exemplars in the\r\npersons of his widow, his son and daughter. There had been an elder\r\nson, Malcolm by name, whose unwavering friendship for Morton in boyhood\r\nand early manhood had opened an avenue to the penniless student and\r\norphan into the bosom of the Effingham family; but Malcolm Effingham\r\nhad died of the Roman fever in Italy, and it had been Morton's\r\nmelancholy duty, as the young gentleman's travelling-companion and\r\nguest, to close his friend's eyes in death and return to America with\r\nhis body.\r\n\r\nThe untimely demise of his elder son had proved a grievous stroke to\r\nSidney Effingham; yet he bore up bravely, in a measure transferring\r\nhis thwarted interest to Malcolm's friend and class-mate. Thus it came\r\nabout that Loyd Morton owed the perfecting of his education to Mr.\r\nEffingham, who insisted that the young man should return to Europe at\r\nhis expense and complete his studies. Moreover, such was his almost\r\nmorbid affection for all that pertained to his dead son, Sidney\r\nEffingham bequeathed a comfortable living to Morton, thus\r\nacknowledging him, as it were, an adopted son.\r\n\r\nThe death of this beneficent gentleman occurred during Morton's\r\ncourtship in Germany, precipitating his marriage and immediate return\r\nto his native land. Though the widow welcomed young Mrs. Morton with\r\nmaternal fervor, to Morton she frankly expressed her regret that he\r\nhad placed himself beyond the possibility of assuming Malcolm's vacant\r\nplace in her household.\r\n\r\n\"But my interest in you remains unabated,\" she assured the young\r\nphysician, \"and it shall be my pleasure to do all that lies in my\r\npower to insure you success in your chosen profession. Otherwise,\r\nleaving my personal affection for you out of the account, I should\r\nfail in my duty as the wife and mother of those who held your welfare\r\nand success so closely at heart.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Serena Effingham had acted in accordance with her noble\r\nconvictions and promise. Thanks to her unflagging interest in his\r\nbehalf, Morton seemed to spring with winged feet into the coveted\r\nhaven of fashionable patronage. There is no gainsaying the fact that\r\nhe maintained his position by consummate ability, and equally there is\r\nno disputing the fact that he was fortunate in the possession of such\r\neminently influential backing.\r\n\r\nAs has been stated, such were his engagements that but few hours of\r\nthe day or night could he call his own, even during the period of his\r\nbereavement. His success had been phenomenal, two brief years having\r\nassured his standing among the leading physicians of his day.\r\n\r\nThis great burden of obligation weighed upon the young doctor's mind,\r\nas he sat beside Malcolm Effingham's brother while the carriage-wheels\r\ndashed through the murky streets of the town and out over the sodden\r\nroad that led to Belvoir,--weighed upon his mind to the partial\r\nobliteration of his recent weird experience with Margaret Revaleon.\r\n\r\nRomaine Effingham--dying!\r\n\r\nOh, it seemed incredible! How was it possible to couple that brilliant\r\nspirit with the grim austerity of Death?\r\n\r\n\"And yet,\" he thought, with a sickening pang at his heart, \"should she\r\ndie now, in her nineteenth year, she will have enjoyed as many days as\r\nwere vouchsafed my poor Paula.\"\r\n\r\nPaula! Merciful heaven, how came it about that he should feel at that\r\nmoment as though he were summoned to Paula's bedside and not\r\nRomaine's?\r\n\r\nWith a start that was half-guilty, half-superstitious, he laid his\r\nhand upon the arm of the mutely eloquent figure at his side.\r\n\r\n\"Hubert!\" he exclaimed in the tone of one who would fain drown the\r\nvoice of conscience, \"Hubert, my dear boy, why do you not speak? Are\r\nyou so anxious?\"\r\n\r\n\"Anxious!\" replied young Effingham, \"I am almost distracted. What will\r\nbecome of us should anything happen to Romaine! O Loyd, what was I to\r\nmother compared with father and Malcolm? what am I to her compared\r\nwith Romaine?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are unjust to yourself, Hubert, you----\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush, hush! Such words from you, who know us so well, sound like lame\r\ncondolence! I cannot bear it while there is a glimmer of hope. By and\r\nby, should there be no help for it, I may be glad to listen to you;\r\nbut not now--oh, not now!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hubert,\" Morton remarked after a momentary pause, \"you must be calm.\r\nIn the few minutes that remain to us I must learn from you something\r\nconcerning Romaine's condition.\"\r\n\r\n\"God knows I am willing to help you all I can.\"\r\n\r\n\"What has happened to her? How is she affected?\"\r\n\r\n\"We were sitting at dinner, Romaine being in her usual health and\r\nspirits. Indeed, I do not remember when she has been so gay. I suppose\r\nher high spirits were caused by the receipt of a letter to-day from\r\nColley, stating that he should sail from Havre by the following\r\nsteamer, and might outstrip his letter.\"\r\n\r\nAt mention of that name, which was simply the nickname of Colston\r\nDrummond, the affianced lover of Romaine Effingham, Loyd Morton\r\nshuddered involuntarily.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well,\" he urged, \"what then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, in the midst of a burst of laughter--you know her laugh, so\r\nlike a peal of bells--Romaine suddenly turned ashy pale, and, with a\r\ngasp, sank back in her chair. My God, I shall never forget my\r\nsensation at that moment! She looked as father looked when he died.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do! We did everything that should be done in such an emergency.\r\nMother was as firm as a rock; but I saw the look of despair in her\r\neyes as she turned to me, saying, 'Go for Loyd, with all speed; go\r\nyourself, and bring him back!'--I have secured you; I have done all\r\nthat I can. The rest remains with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"With _me_!\" gasped Morton. \"Do you mean to say that you have not\r\ncalled in some other physician at such a crisis?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have perfect confidence in you, Loyd.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good heavens! This is too great a responsibility! I am not--not--\" He\r\nwas going to add, \"I am not equal to such an emergency. You must send\r\nat once for some other doctor,\" when he paused abruptly, turning\r\nghastly pale as the words recurred to him, unbidden as the mournful\r\nrustling of the leaves of memory,\r\n\r\n\"A woman's soul is trembling upon the threshold of eternity. If you\r\nare alone with her when that soul takes wing, my spirit will instantly\r\ntake its place, and your skill will do the rest. Accomplish the\r\nresurrection of that body, and secure our further communion.\"\r\n\r\nConsultation with another physician might be the means of saving\r\nRomaine Effingham's life! After all, what mattered it if he were\r\ndestined to resurrect her body, though henceforth it was to become the\r\ndomicile of a soul for the recovery of which he would have sacrificed\r\ntwenty thousand Romaines?\r\n\r\nConsequently he bit his lips in silence. And at that moment the\r\nmassive gateway of Belvoir gave back a sepulchral echo of the grinding\r\ncarriage-wheels, while lights glimmered wanly beyond the fog-trailed\r\nlawn.\r\n\r\nAn exceedingly charming girl was Romaine Effingham. She possessed that\r\nunconscious grace which resides in the joy of youth and ease of heart.\r\nShe was beautiful, accomplished, brilliant, and when, upon the eve of\r\nhis departure for Europe, her engagement to Colston Drummond was\r\nannounced, the fashionable world joined its plaudits and\r\ncongratulations to its acknowledgments for the favor of having been\r\npermitted to witness at least one genuine example of the eternal\r\nfitness of things.\r\n\r\nNot to have known Romaine Effingham personally, may be accounted a\r\npositive deprivation; while, to have been ignorant of the existence of\r\n\"Colley\" Drummond, that estimable corypheus of patrician youth, was\r\nequivalent to confessing one's self quite unknown; and that without a\r\nshade of irony, since Colston Drummond was, in the best sense, a man\r\nof that world which has reason to consider itself well-born. So much\r\nhaving been admitted, one may feel inclined to sympathize with the\r\nlegion who loved Romaine and admired her lover.\r\n\r\nIt was a grievous sight indeed, to see the fair young girl low lying\r\nin her dainty chamber, with the pallid sign of death on lip and cheek.\r\nEqually pitiful was it to mark the mute anguish of that noble mother,\r\nwhose life had been one era of devotion to her children. They had been\r\nher very idols--her treasures beyond price. She had passed whole days\r\nand nights in attendance upon them during their slight juvenile\r\nailments--days and nights which to fashionable women of her ilk are\r\nprecious epochs of social dissipation. To have gone into society\r\nleaving one of her children ill at home, it mattered not how trifling\r\nthe indisposition, would have been as utter an impossibility to Serena\r\nEffingham as for her to have regarded with an indifferent eye the\r\npresent deathlike syncope of her beautiful daughter. As she had been\r\nfaithful in the minutiæ of maternal duty, so was she proportionally\r\nconstant in greater exigencies. With eyes haggard with suspense, she\r\nwatched the wan face upon the pillow, while her heart-beats told her\r\nhow the laggard moments dragged themselves away--away from the happy\r\npast, on towards the menacing future.\r\n\r\nA sepulchral silence had settled upon the house, portentous in its\r\nprofundity; consequently the slightest sound seemed almost painfully\r\nmagnified. Naturally, then, the roll of the carriage-wheels upon the\r\nflagging before the principal entrance sounded an alarm to the anxious\r\nwatcher's heart.\r\n\r\n\"They have come at last!\" she breathed. \"God grant that they come not\r\nin vain!\"\r\n\r\nWith the prayer trembling upon her lips, she met Loyd Morton at the\r\nhead of the staircase. She noted the deadly pallor upon the young\r\ndoctor's face and the unusual dilation of his eyes; but she thought\r\nthey argued his keen anxiety, as, in a certain sense, they did. She\r\ngave him her hand, with a firm clasp, and dimly noted that his were as\r\ncold as ice. She drew him to her and kissed him, heedless of the fact\r\nthat he failed to return the salute.\r\n\r\n\"You must save her, Loyd,\" she murmured. \"Our hope is built upon your\r\nskill. If ever you loved us, have pity upon us now!\"\r\n\r\nHe made no reply to the solemn injunction; perhaps words failed him at\r\nthat supreme moment, perhaps he felt silence to be the wiser course.\r\nShe relinquished her hold upon him, and he crossed the hall. At the\r\ndoor of the dimly lighted chamber he paused and turned abruptly. The\r\nrustle of her dress betrayed the fact that she was close in his wake.\r\n\r\n\"Permit me to make an examination,\" he faltered, with evident\r\nconstraint; \"I--I will then report.\" The strained circumstances seemed\r\nto invest his words with a defiant ring--at least, her woman's\r\ninstinct suggested the fancy; but she respected his request and joined\r\nher son, where he stood, at the head of the staircase, leaning upon\r\nhis arm for support. From where they stood, mother and son could see\r\nMorton bending above the inanimate form, could watch him as he lowered\r\nhis head close to the pillow, holding it in that position for what\r\nseemed a very eternity.\r\n\r\nWas he listening for some token of fluttering vitality? Was he\r\napplying some remedy?\r\n\r\nOnce Serena Effingham started, as a single word, possibly a name,\r\nreached her listening ear from the dim chamber. _Was_ it a name she\r\nheard? If so, _whose_ name? For an instant she was half inclined to\r\nfancy that her tense anxiety had produced some passing delusion. Yet,\r\nhad she been put upon her oath, she would have been forced to confess\r\nthat the name which had reached her was that of one dead--the name of\r\n_Paula_!\r\n\r\nThe fancy appeared preposterous; she had no intention of betraying\r\nsuch a piece of sensationalism to her son, while Hubert Effingham had\r\nno opportunity of inquiring into the cause of her sudden emotion,\r\nsince at the moment Morton quitted the bedside and came quickly forth\r\nto join them.\r\n\r\n\"Her swoon is yielding,\" he said, in answer to the eloquent appeal of\r\ntheir eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Thank God!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, she had passed beyond the portals of death, but she has\r\nreturned.\" He spoke according to his present conviction, not as the\r\nscientist he prided himself upon being. \"She will shortly be\r\nconscious,\" he added, cutting short their eager queries; \"her mind\r\nwill be in an acutely sensitive condition, and, absolute quiet\r\nthroughout the house is indispensable. I will watch till midnight\r\nwhen, if her condition is favorable, I will relinquish my place to\r\nyou.\" He glanced at Serena Effingham. \"I would advise you to secure\r\nwhat rest you can during the intervening hours.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned to re-enter the chamber, when the lady laid a detaining hand\r\nupon his arm.\r\n\r\n\"Loyd,\" she whispered, \"tell me one thing. What do you consider the\r\ncause of this awful trance?\"\r\n\r\n\"Her heart,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"Then she may die as her father died?\"\r\n\r\n\"It does not follow. She may never have a recurrence of the trouble.\r\nWhat I fear is--\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you fear?\"\r\n\r\nThe sensitive lines of his face seemed to petrify as with a desperate\r\nresolution he replied:\r\n\r\n\"I fear her mind may be affected by this attack.\"\r\n\r\n\"Her _mind_! Oh, Loyd, tell me anything but that!\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you prefer her death?\" he demanded, almost harshly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, no, no!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then let us hope for the best; or at least make the best of the\r\ninevitable. You may take comfort in the fact that I promise you\r\nRomaine's life.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned abruptly as he spoke, and entering the chamber, silently but\r\nsecurely closed the door.\r\n\r\nThen it was that the mother's fortitude gave way, and turning to her\r\nson, she flung herself upon his breast and burst into tears.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Hubert,\" she sobbed, \"what dreadful spell is upon us? After all\r\nthese years--though I have known Loyd from his infancy, have loved him\r\nalmost as one of my own children, to-night he seems a stranger to me!\r\nWhat does it mean? what does it all portend?\"\r\n\r\nHe strove to soothe her with loving words, and almost bearing her\r\nprecious weight in his arms, he led her away to her own apartments.\r\n\r\nAnd then, in expressive silence, the night wore on to its mid-watch.\r\nThe pale crescent of the moon dropped behind the hills, while here and\r\nthere a lonesome star peered forth in the rifts of the scudding wrack.\r\n\r\nAt last, and just upon the stroke of midnight, the vigil was disturbed\r\nby the sound of wheels, of footsteps, of voices, and by the muffled\r\nunclosing and closing of doors. Loyd Morton started from his chair at\r\nthe bedside of the sleeping girl. He was pallid to the lips, and with\r\ndifficulty commanded the desperate condition of his nerves. Contrary\r\nto his commands, the door of the chamber had been opened to admit the\r\nstalwart figure of a man. The pair had not met in many a year, but in\r\nthe dim radiance of the shaded lamp, their recognition was\r\ninstantaneous.\r\n\r\nFor an instant Morton quailed. The intruder who had braved his\r\nauthority, to which even the anxiety of a mother deferred, was Colston\r\nDrummond!\r\n\r\nThe confrontation bristled with omen.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n    \"I do not know what witchcraft's in him.\"\r\n\r\nHad he been put upon the rack Loyd Morton would still have been unable\r\nto give any coherent account of his vigil at the bedside of Romaine\r\nEffingham. Four hours had elapsed from the moment that he closed the\r\nchamber-door until, upon the stroke of midnight, it opened to admit\r\nColston Drummond. Reflection failed to assist him to any satisfactory\r\nexplanation regarding the flight of the time. He was morally certain\r\nthat he had not lost an instant in slumber, the tension upon his mind\r\nwould be almost proof positive that he could not have lapsed into\r\nunconsciousness; and yet the span seemed a complete void as he looked\r\nback upon it.\r\n\r\nRomaine still lived; indeed her hold upon vitality had visibly\r\nstrengthened since Morton's advent, yet, so far as his cognizance of\r\nthe phenomenon went, Nature unassisted had taken the resurrection into\r\nher own hands. Resurrection was Morton's estimate of the miracle,\r\nsince every token of immediate dissolution was present in the\r\nappearance of his patient when first he bent over her. The eyes were\r\nglazed, the flesh clammy, and the pulsations imperceptible. The\r\nextremities were cold with that peculiar chill which is so eloquent to\r\nthe practised touch. Death's conquest was imminent, perhaps assured,\r\nand he had done nothing to avert the dread consummation--nothing save\r\nto murmur the name of one which embodied, for him, the quintessence of\r\nexistence here and hereafter.\r\n\r\n\"Paula!\" he had murmured, half tentatively, half mechanically.\r\n\r\nIt must have been the result of sorcery if simply at the utterance of\r\nthat name Death furled his pale flag and left the field to his\r\nerstwhile routed opponent. Yet such was the case, as the physician's\r\nkeen senses promptly detected. The young man experienced a thrill\r\nsecond to none that as yet he had encountered in his professional\r\ncareer, as upon his finger-tips came the delicate flutter of the\r\npulse, while to his eager sight followed a gentle upheaval of the\r\nbreast that sent a quivering sigh to his listening ear.\r\n\r\nIt was a supreme moment to Loyd Morton.\r\n\r\nNaturally his first impulse was to apply some restorative and thus\r\nassist resuscitation. There was brandy at hand, a small quantity of\r\nwhich he inserted, drop by drop, between the parted lips. The effect\r\nproduced seemed magical; the respiration became steady, a delicate\r\nglow crept into the wan cheeks, while a genial warmth attended by that\r\nmost encouraging of symptoms, a dew-like moisture, relaxed the cold\r\nrigidity of the hands that returned the faintest possible pressure as\r\nthey rested in the young doctor's clasp. Every token of convalescence\r\nby degrees made itself manifest and progressed until the soft gray\r\neyes unclosed, instinct with crescent intelligence.\r\n\r\nThe watcher bent eagerly so that his countenance should fill the field\r\nof her vision, so that her awakening consciousness should grasp his\r\npersonality to the exclusion of all other objects. Apparently the\r\nunpremeditated act met with flattering success, in that Romaine\r\nEffingham's first utterance framed his name.\r\n\r\n\"Loyd!\"\r\n\r\nIt was simply an articulate breath, but it was a conscious utterance\r\ncapable of interpretation, and Morton was satisfied; nay, he was\r\nenraptured.\r\n\r\n\"Paula!\" he exclaimed, in his exaltation, \"Paula, you have come back\r\nto me!\"\r\n\r\n\"I have--come back,\" was the tremulous reply.\r\n\r\n\"And we shall never, never again be parted,\" he urged with passionate\r\nintensity.\r\n\r\nThe dilated eyes watched him as if spell-bound.\r\n\r\n\"You understand that you are no longer Romaine, but Paula, my own\r\ndear, true love,\" he continued, giving each word its due import;\r\n\"Romaine has gone to her rest, but you have returned to make my life\r\nonce more worth the living! Oh, my dear one, tell me that you realize\r\nthe situation, that you comprehend my words! Let me hear you say that\r\nyou are Paula, my wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Paula, your wife,\" came the obedient echo.\r\n\r\nHad he been in his normal condition of self-control, Morton's\r\nexuberant satisfaction might have been tempered by a consciousness of\r\nthe fact that he was forcing his own volition upon a cataleptic\r\nsubject; the strained circumstances under which he labored, however,\r\nspared him this somewhat matter-of-fact view of the case. Indeed, he\r\nhad closed all avenues of approach to unwelcome spectres of the\r\nscientific order, for the time being at least. Moreover, he had\r\npermitted himself to lose sight of an attribute which upon more than\r\none occasion had been imputed to him. It had been whispered among his\r\nhyper-sensitive patients that the young physician possessed that most\r\nmysterious, yet positive, of gifts, mesmeric power, animal\r\nmagnetism,--what you will. Be that as it may, Loyd Morton undoubtedly\r\nexerted a strong attraction for those in whom he was personally\r\ninterested. Babblers had informed him of his endowment much, be it\r\nsaid, to his annoyance; but the fact remained that he held his fellow\r\nman in thrall, whether he would or not.\r\n\r\nEither of the above considerations would have tinctured his\r\noverflowing cup with bitterness; but as he had already drained that\r\ncup of joy, it remained for digestion to prove whether the adverse\r\nmixture had crept in in some ingustable form.\r\n\r\nA few more words of passionate admonition he addressed to his patient\r\nere the eye-lids drooped and the breathing became measured as in that\r\nprofound slumber which succeeds exhaustion.\r\n\r\nAnd thereupon began that extraordinary vigil, during which Morton was\r\nconscious of naught save the assured resurrection and possible--he\r\ndared not think probable--reincarnation.\r\n\r\nShe had placed her hand in his ere she fell asleep, and he sat close\r\nbeside her scarcely venturing to relinquish it into the keeping of its\r\nfellow where it rested upon her breast. By the light of the shaded\r\nlamp he studied the calm beauty of the girl's features, the restful\r\nslumber lending a heightening touch to their exquisite outline.\r\n\r\nAlways a being set above and apart from his anxious existence, he had\r\nseen even less than formerly of Romaine since his marriage, and in\r\nthat time she had matured into the perfection of womanhood. He had\r\nloved her, as he had loved the other members of her family, with a\r\nlove born of gratitude. There had been no sentiment in this love\r\nbeyond that of grateful appreciation; he had loved Romaine exactly in\r\nthe vein that he had loved her brothers; had he been called upon, he\r\nwould have laid down his life for any of them with undiscriminating\r\nloyalty. Having been his intimate friend, Malcolm might have stood\r\nfirst in a test of self-sacrifice, but there had never been the\r\nslightest shade of difference in his sense of allegiance to either\r\nHubert or Romaine. In a word, he had never loved Romaine otherwise\r\nthan as a friend; within the niche before which his soul bowed down in\r\nall-absorbing idolatry he had set up the image of the woman who had\r\nbeen his wife, and as it was a case of soul-worship with him, the\r\nniche remained occupied to the eternal exclusion of rival effigies.\r\n\r\nHe recalled with a flutter of timid pride how officious friends,\r\nambitious of his welfare, had ventured to couple his name with that of\r\nRomaine.\r\n\r\n\"You were her brother's 'Fidus Achates,'\" they urged; \"you have\r\nreceived not only marks of affection from every member of her family,\r\nbut positive encouragement in every form. Take Malcolm's vacant place\r\nand be a son and brother and husband all in one.\"\r\n\r\nTo this friendly folly he smiled in answer, saying, \"You admit that I\r\nassumed the rôle of Achates to perfection, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly!\" was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"Then let me rest upon my laurels. I am wise in my own generation. I\r\nknow the limit of my histrionic ability and have no wish to attempt an\r\nimpersonation of Phaethon.\"\r\n\r\nHence his friends inferred that he was disinclined to court Romaine\r\nEffingham through modesty or diffidence, little dreaming that he\r\nrefused to enter the lists through lack of inclination. Even upon this\r\nnight as he sat at her bed-side, keeping vigil while she slept,\r\nsatisfied that she was convalescent, he was simply grateful that\r\nheaven in its mercy had spared her to her mother and brother, and--\r\n\r\nA cold perspiration akin to the dews of death, pearled upon his brow,\r\ngrown suddenly pallid, as a problem of dire import flitted like a\r\ngrewsome spectre into the field of his speculation.\r\n\r\n\"If,\" suggested the phantom, with appalling reason, \"she is spared to\r\nher mother and brother, is she not spared as well to her affianced\r\nlover? Will he not shortly claim her as his own? And if, as you have\r\nbeen persuaded to believe, her soul is at rest while the soul of one\r\nyou have loved and lost is renascent, incarnate in her body, how will\r\nyou bear this second separation, this alienation in life, which\r\npromises to be infinitely more trying than that of death?\"\r\n\r\nHe sat as one spell-bound, listening in horror to the silent voice.\r\n\r\nHe relaxed his hold upon the girl's hand and it fell limply at her\r\nside. His eyes grew haggard with the speechless agony of uncertainty,\r\nwhile his pallid lips strove to utter the cry of his anguished soul,\r\n\"My God, why did I not foresee this emergency? Thou art my judge that\r\nI would not cause her one instant's misery, would not cast my shadow\r\nin the path of her perfect happiness for my life, and yet\"--\"And yet,\"\r\nresumed the voice of the phantom--alas, with no intonation of\r\nmockery--\"and yet you must secure her body in order to claim communion\r\nwith the soul that now animates it. Look upon her, strive to realize\r\nthat this is Paula your wife and no longer the daughter of your\r\nbenefactors.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, grant me some proof!\" he moaned; \"Paula! Paula, speak to me! In\r\nheaven's name, give me the satisfaction of _knowing_ that you are with\r\nme once again, or this uncertainty will drive me mad!\" He had dropped\r\nupon his knees at the bedside and had almost roughly resumed\r\npossession of her hand, passionately pressing it to his lips.\r\n\"Paula,\" he cried, \"assure me that you are here, grant me some token\r\nthat you recognize me, Loyd, your husband, and help me to shape my\r\ncourse of action, for now is the appointed time; one precious moment\r\nlost and we may be estranged, hopelessly parted. I am groping in\r\ndarkness like unto the shadow of death. If ever I needed thy guiding\r\nhand, I need it now, in this supreme, this awful moment. Oh, hear me,\r\nPaula! I conjure you, speak to me!\"\r\n\r\nAs if in answer to his desperate exhortation, she stirred in her\r\nsleep, and he felt the soft flutter of her hand as it lay crushed\r\nbetween his.\r\n\r\n\"No, no!\" he panted, \"you _must_ speak, or I shall not be satisfied\r\nthat it is indeed _you_! Call me Loyd, husband--anything you will, so\r\nthat I recognize your presence?\"\r\n\r\nHe arose and bent low above her, almost crying aloud in exultation as\r\nher lips parted to exhale his name, simply his name.\r\n\r\n\"Loyd!\"\r\n\r\nThen the profound slumber resumed its sway.\r\n\r\nHe raised the quiescent figure in his arms and imprinted a passionate\r\nkiss upon the low brow.\r\n\r\n\"Did you not promise me,\" he whispered, \"that before the dawn of\r\nanother day I should take a living body in my arms and know that it is\r\nanimated by your soul? Your prophecy has come true and I thank God for\r\nit!\"\r\n\r\nVery gently he lowered the delicate form among the pillows and with a\r\nreverent touch placed the hand that he had caressed, within the clasp\r\nof its fellow; then he turned and began to pace the shadowy chamber in\r\na state of uncontrollable excitement.\r\n\r\n\"She warned me,\" he murmured, \"that consequences would arise over\r\nwhich she should have no control; warned me that _I_ should have to\r\nconfront them. I assured her that I was not only ready, but eager to\r\naccept the chances. What was my conviction at that moment compared\r\nwith the overwhelming conviction that commands me _now_? Then she was\r\nintangible, invisible even,--a spirit; now she is in the flesh and has\r\naddressed me with lips of flesh! Be the consequences what they may,\r\nthis body which has served her soul with the means of reincarnation\r\nshall belong to me, as wholly and entirely as her soul, which is mine\r\nto all eternity!\"\r\n\r\n\"You do not love that body,\" whispered the spectral Mentor; \"beautiful\r\nas in itself it is, it possesses no attraction for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"By degrees I shall learn to cherish it,\" was the undaunted reply;\r\n\"shortly I shall love it as being _her_ abode.\"\r\n\r\nArgument was out of the question in his existing condition of mental\r\nexultation; not that he had quite lost his grip upon himself, since\r\nsome semblance of common-sense had borne ecstatic fancy company in her\r\nflight to the lofty pinnacle upon which she now poised, as his next\r\nmore material thought gives evidence. He had reached the fire-place in\r\nhis nervous perambulation and had paused upon the hearth, mechanically\r\nsetting his gaze upon the smouldering embers.\r\n\r\n\"I would to heaven,\" he muttered, \"that Paula's spirit had returned to\r\nme in any other guise than this! I shudder before the complication\r\nthat looms upon the near horizon, and yet in what am I to be blamed\r\nfor what of necessity must transpire in the immediate future? How can\r\nI be expected, in the very nature of things, to be able to explain to\r\nDrummond the reason that he should cease to cherish his love and\r\nrelinquish all to me? Would he not consider me hopelessly insane were\r\nI to lay before him the reason for my determined action, expose a\r\nscheme which even in my eyes seems unparalleled in the history of\r\nman? No, no! I am convinced that so occult a compact must remain an\r\ninviolable secret between the Infinite and me. I feel myself to be but\r\na mere factor in some great covenant, an instrument, a simple means\r\ntending towards an end of which I am in ignorance.\"\r\n\r\nThe smouldering embers fell together upon the hearth, emitting one\r\nexpiring lance of flame, illumining his pallid features grown tense\r\nand rigid with resolution.\r\n\r\n\"I may be forced to dissimulation, even to deceit,\" he concluded,\r\nturning away from the dazzling gleam, \"in order to effect my purpose.\r\nAlready, as it were unconsciously, have I prepared Mrs. Effingham for\r\npossible catastrophes. I have told her that her daughter will recover,\r\nbut in the same breath I warned her that I feared for her mental\r\ncondition. Why I so warned her, heaven only knows. So far as I know at\r\npresent that utterance was a lie, a base, ignoble fabrication; but it\r\ncame unbidden to my lips, and who shall say that it came not at the\r\ninstigation of some mysterious power beyond and above me? Who shall\r\ndeny that, since I have ceased to be the man I was, some species of\r\nclairvoyant skill has descended upon me as the natural concomitant of\r\nthe atmosphere of unreality that henceforth I shall breathe?\"\r\n\r\nHe turned quickly and crept to the bedside, a desperate expression\r\nkindling in his haggard eyes as they rested upon the sleeping girl.\r\n\r\n\"Whether the issue proves me to be clairvoyant or brands me with\r\nfalsehood, I must establish mental aberration in my patient, or lose\r\nmy prize,\" he muttered; \"I have burned my bridges and there is no\r\nretreating now!\"\r\n\r\nScarcely had the incoherent words escaped his lips ere a clock tolled\r\nmidnight and simultaneously the sound of wheels upon the terrace\r\ndisturbed the peaceful course of night.\r\n\r\nThereupon followed the confusion of the muffled unclosing and closing\r\nof doors, excited voices and hurrying footsteps.\r\n\r\nThe sleeper stirred and moaned. Morton drew himself up into an\r\nattitude of unconscious defence, vaguely preparing himself for menace\r\nor attack, and in the next instant the door was thrust open to admit\r\nColston Drummond.\r\n\r\nNo need to glance twice at the handsome face in order to guess the\r\nungovernable anxiety and disarray that possessed the young lover.\r\n\r\n\"Is she alive?\" he gasped, advancing into the middle of the chamber.\r\n\r\nFor answer, Morton imperiously waved him back in silence.\r\n\r\n\"No, no!\" he cried, \"give me some satisfaction! Tell me at least that\r\nI have not arrived too late! In God's name, why do you not speak?\"\r\n\r\nBarring his impetuous passage to the bedside, even laying detaining\r\nhands upon Drummond's shoulders, Morton was about to reply, when a low\r\ncry disturbed the ominous pause.\r\n\r\nSnatched from her profound slumber and unobserved, Romaine Effingham\r\nhad struggled up to a sitting posture and straightway fallen back with\r\nthe cry which had startled the silence.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, why will you torture me?\" she moaned piteously, flinging her arms\r\nacross her face as if in desperate effort to shut out the sight of\r\nsome uncanny apparition; \"take him--take him away and let me--rest! In\r\nmercy, let me rest!\"\r\n\r\n\"Romaine! Great heaven! what does this mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Silence!\" commanded Morton, releasing his hold and retreating a step,\r\nwhile a gleam of triumph flickered for one brief moment in his sunken\r\neyes; \"Mr. Drummond, if you have any respect for the life of Miss\r\nEffingham, you will instantly leave this room!\"\r\n\r\n\"Her life?\" echoed Drummond in suspense, \"it appears to me rather as\r\nif her _reason_ were in jeopardy!\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right,\" came the firm response, \"her reason is gone--she is\r\n_mad_!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n    \"She is abused, stolen from me, and corrupted by spells and\r\n    medicines bought of mountebanks.\"\r\n\r\n\"A day in April never came so sweet to show how costly summer was at\r\nhand,\" may be quoted as applicable to the rare dawn that succeeded\r\nthat night of mystic import at Belvoir. The whole world seemed\r\ninstinct with the smile of jocund spring. The dreary night had wept\r\nitself away, leaving its tears to jewel each new-born blade of grass.\r\nHigh up upon the spacious lawn crocuses fluttered their imperial\r\nraiment while snowdrops nodded and shook their bells as the bland wind\r\nswept by. The brook, swollen to a ruffled sea that inundated the\r\nlow-land meadows, swirled through the willow-copse plumed to its crest\r\nwith golden down in token of its glad revival. The trees stretched\r\nforth their yearning arms green with enamel of new buds; and over all\r\nthe sun, rejoicing in release, shot his bright lances into nook and\r\ndell where lurked the mists of yesterday.\r\n\r\nYet, despite the allurements of the outer world, the inmates of\r\nBelvoir House remained invisible, and the stately white columns were\r\nleft to mount guard over their sharply defined shadows along the sunny\r\npiazza.\r\n\r\nWithin the mansion much of the silence and gloom of the preceding\r\nnight prevailed. Breakfast had been prepared as usual, but the\r\nappointed hour had passed unheeded, a significant fact in a household\r\nof such rigid regulation. By and by, however, a rustle upon the\r\nstaircase announced the appearance of Mrs. Effingham.\r\n\r\nMeeting a servant upon the way, the lady inquired where she should\r\nfind Mr. Drummond; the man replied that he was closeted in the library\r\nwith his young master, Hubert.\r\n\r\nThither she went directly, entering suddenly, and surprising the young\r\ngentlemen in the depths of earnest conversation.\r\n\r\n\"You have seen Romaine?\" they inquired simultaneously.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I have just left her.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is she?\"\r\n\r\n\"Apparently safe.\"\r\n\r\nThereupon a strained silence ensued, during which Drummond led Mrs.\r\nEffingham to a divan and seated himself beside her, while Hubert\r\nwatched the pair with an intentness that reflected the motive of his\r\ninterrupted conversation with his future brother-in-law.\r\n\r\nColston Drummond was the first to break the silence.\r\n\r\n\"How do you find Romaine?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nThe lines of anxious care deepened upon the lady's face as she\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n\"I have said that I consider her perfectly safe.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Mentally_ as well as physically?\"\r\n\r\n\"How can I tell? As yet I have seen no signs of derangement in her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Drummond, eagerly, \"then you refuse to credit _his_\r\nannouncement that she is mad!\"\r\n\r\n\"If you mean Loyd, I believe that he has spoken in accordance with his\r\nconvictions.\"\r\n\r\n\"He _may_ be mistaken,\" was the terse reply.\r\n\r\nSerena Effingham glanced in a startled way from one to the other of\r\nthe young men, and it was Hubert who came to her relief.\r\n\r\n\"Colley has been urging the necessity of calling in another\r\nphysician,\" he explained. \"But I tell him, mother, that we have reason\r\nto have implicit faith in Loyd's ability; besides, it would seem like\r\ninsult to send for any one now that she is out of danger.\"\r\n\r\nDrummond passed his hand over his curling hair with a gesture eloquent\r\nof impatient doubt.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, I will not interfere if you are satisfied,\" he said. \"But\r\nI beg you to answer me one question, for I feel that I shall never\r\nsleep, nor rest in peace until it is answered.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it, my dear boy?\" inquired Mrs. Effingham.\r\n\r\n\"You will grant me that Romaine is my affianced wife?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\n\"No one disputes that point.\"\r\n\r\n\"And she loves me with her whole heart and soul? No, you need not\r\nanswer that question! Here upon my heart lies her last letter, written\r\nwithin the month. I want no better evidence that she is mine, as truly\r\nas woman was ever man's.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well? What more do you ask?\"\r\n\r\n\"What more?\" he cried excitedly. \"I ask why she screamed at sight of\r\nme last night, crying piteously, 'Why will you torture me? Take him\r\naway and let me rest!' Can you explain such words upon _her_ lips, and\r\nat sight of _me_?\"\r\n\r\n\"She was not herself, Colston. Her attitude towards you is proof that\r\nher mind is indeed deranged.\"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head dejectedly.\r\n\r\n\"You have just told me that as yet you have seen no signs of\r\nderangement in her,\" he said. \"Tell me, if you can, why she should\r\nseem insane to me, yet sane to you?\"\r\n\r\nAt this juncture Serena Effingham turned to Drummond and flung her\r\narms about his neck.\r\n\r\n\"My darling boy,\" she murmured, gently; \"for you are that, and ever\r\nwill be to me. You are worn out with fatigue and excitement. The shock\r\nof finding Romaine so ill, after your long and hopeful journey, has\r\ncompletely unhinged you. But I sympathize with you. Remember, that my\r\nlove for her is akin to yours, and remember, too, that God is good;\r\nand I believe that, if we pray unceasingly, He in His mercy will give\r\nher back to us, sane and whole again.\"\r\n\r\nHe stooped and kissed her up-turned forehead, as he replied,\r\n\r\n\"God bless you, dear mother. I would that my faith were such as\r\nyours!\"\r\n\r\nThen, releasing himself from the lady's embrace, he rose, adding,\r\n\r\n\"I am going to breakfast with my mother at Drummond Lodge. Meanwhile,\r\n_watch Romaine_! I shall return later in the day and shall depend upon\r\nan interview with her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which I may almost promise shall be granted you.\"\r\n\r\nThe voice that uttered these unexpected words was low of pitch yet\r\nstartlingly sonorous; indeed, so unprepared were the trio for the\r\nsudden intrusion, that they were quite thrown off their guard, and\r\nturned about in some disarray.\r\n\r\nDoctor Loyd Morton proved to be the intruder. He stood upon the\r\nthreshold of the apartment, parting the drapery with one outstretched\r\nhand, while the extreme pallor of his countenance, the firmness of his\r\nglance, as well as his pronounced dignity of mien, failed not to\r\nimpress his beholders.\r\n\r\nDivining that the situation threatened to become strained, Mrs.\r\nEffingham remarked quickly,\r\n\r\n\"We have been waiting for you to breakfast with us, Loyd.\" Then\r\nturning to Drummond, she added, \"We shall look for you at dinner,\r\nColston. Always bear in mind that you are at home at Belvoir.\"\r\n\r\nDrummond bowed in silence, and with one glance at Morton, who had\r\nadvanced a step, still holding the drapery, he passed into the hall,\r\naccompanied by Hubert.\r\n\r\nThe moment the drapery fell into place again, Serena Effingham\r\nadvanced impulsively and kissed Morton with the maternal fervor which\r\nhad ever been her wont with him.\r\n\r\n\"What a debt we owe you, Loyd, dear,\" she murmured beneath her breath,\r\nwhile her eyes lingered upon the swaying folds that hid Drummond from\r\nher view.\r\n\r\n\"Address your thanks to God,\" he replied, steadily, holding her in his\r\narms.\r\n\r\n\"You have saved her life!\"\r\n\r\n\"Say rather that He has spared her.\"\r\n\r\n\"She would have died had you not come to us.\"\r\n\r\nThe firmness of his glance never wavered for an instant as he\r\nanswered,\r\n\r\n\"That is true; but we must bear in mind that I am but an instrument in\r\nthe hands of the Almighty.\"\r\n\r\nAnd his words were uttered with as sincere a conviction as had ever\r\npossessed him. However deeply he may have been impressed by the\r\nquestionable part he was enacting, he was satisfied that Romaine\r\nEffingham would have been laid beside her father and brother in the\r\ntomb but for his influence, at the moment of the crisis. Through his\r\ninterposition, he told himself, her body had been saved; with the fate\r\nthat had befallen her soul he was not concerned. In a series of\r\ngyrations, never-ending in their recurrence, the words seemed to dance\r\nthrough his brain, \"A body is theirs, a soul is mine; a soul is mine,\r\na body is theirs,\" and so on, and on, and on, with incessant swirl and\r\nswing until, dazed and confused, he was forced to seek the palliative\r\nof fresh air under pretence of making a hasty round of visits upon his\r\npatients.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, above stairs in her dainty chamber, Romaine had been\r\nclothed in a robe of delicate texture, snowy as the billowy rifts of\r\nswan's-down that strayed about the neck and down the front, and had\r\nbeen placed in the azure depths of silken cushions upon a lounge that\r\nstood where the flood of genial sunshine streamed in. Beside her a\r\nhuge cluster of mingled Freesia and golden jonquils spent their rich\r\nfragrance upon the air, conjuring, as it were, a hint of the exuberant\r\nspring-tide within the house. A very festival of warmth and light\r\nseemed to hold the chamber beneath its inspiring spell, calling forth\r\nethereal tones in the blues of the rugs and hangings, and investing\r\nthe silver upon the toilet-table with a quite magical glitter.\r\n\r\nA little maid, meek-eyed as any dove, went here and there with\r\nnoiseless step, putting the finishing touches to the final arrangement\r\nof the room. Now and again she would cast a dutiful glance towards the\r\ncouch whereon lay her fair young mistress, with eye-lids drooping\r\nuntil the dark lashes rested upon her pale cheeks, her slender fingers\r\ninterlaced upon her breast.\r\n\r\nThere were sparrows chirping somewhere about the casements, while from\r\nthe distance the hum of pastoral life came drowsily to the ear.\r\n\r\nThe little maid fluttered her plumed brush about a Dresden cavalier,\r\nruthlessly smothering a kiss that he had been vainly endeavoring for\r\nyears to blow from the tips of his effeminate fingers to a mincing\r\nshepherdess, beyond the clock upon the mantle. In due time she\r\nrelieved the love-lorn knight and fell upon his inamorata, favoring\r\nher with the same unceremonious treatment. The clock chimed twelve to\r\nthe accompaniment of a brief waltz, presumably executed upon the lute\r\nof the china goat-herd that surmounted the time-piece, and at the same\r\nmoment Romaine Effingham stirred. In an instant the faithful watcher\r\nwas beside the couch.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Romaine!\" she breathed, \"it is I, Joan. Can I do anything for\r\nMiss Romaine?\"\r\n\r\nOne of the slender hands was raised and rested lightly upon the little\r\nmaid's head.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" was the low reply. \"You may find him and send him to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who, Miss Romaine? Mr. Hubert?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Drummond?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" emphatically, but not impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! I know--Doctor Morton?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes!\" with a sigh. \"Loyd; go and find him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Miss Romaine.\"\r\n\r\nBut instead of Loyd Morton it was Serena Effingham who had hastened\r\npromptly to her daughter's side.\r\n\r\n\"Here I am, dear,\" she said, stooping to caress the fair low brow. \"I\r\nhave been besieged by callers to inquire for you, but from this moment\r\nI will deny myself to everyone until you are quite strong and well\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I sent for Loyd,\" persisted the girl, in the same calm tone.\r\n\r\n\"Loyd has gone to visit his patients, my darling; but you may depend\r\nupon it he will not be gone long.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope not. O, how devoted he is! Why, it is to him that I owe my\r\nlife, for he has brought me back to life; and yet--and yet how strange\r\nit seems that I cannot recollect where I have been in all this time!\"\r\n\r\n\"Dearest child, do not distress yourself,\" urged the mother anxiously;\r\n\"you will recall everything in time and all will be well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, but it is not distress to me! It was like a dream of heaven when\r\nI heard his voice calling me to come out of the shadow into the\r\nradiance that his dear face shed about me! Oh, there can be no death\r\nwhere he is, and no sorrow while he is by!\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled as one smiles in sleep, and let her eye-lids droop until\r\nthe lashes cast their shadow.\r\n\r\nEach of the strange words deepened the pallor upon Serena Effingham's\r\nface, a sign of anxious care, perhaps not wholly due to her\r\nconsciousness of the fact that her daughter was actually under the\r\nspell of a gentle hallucination; as a matter of fact it pained her\r\nthat that hallucination had taken a course somewhat at variance with\r\nDrummond's interests.\r\n\r\nAs she had determined, from that moment she devoted herself to\r\nRomaine. The greater part of the time the girl slept soundly; during\r\nthe intervals of wakefulness she seemed happy and at perfect peace\r\nwithin herself. Occasionally she would break her complacent silence by\r\ninquiries for Morton; otherwise she appeared inclined to enter into no\r\nsort of converse.\r\n\r\nSuch nourishment as was offered her she accepted with relish,\r\nremarking once, with a fleeting smile, \"I have seen enough of death\r\nfor one lifetime; and I want to live, since I have so much to live\r\nfor.\"\r\n\r\nPlainly her volition materially assisted her convalescence, which was\r\nrapid--visible almost from hour to hour. And thus the uneventful\r\nafternoon waned to early evening. The goat-herd rehearsed his brief\r\nwaltz over and over again, and the sun went westward, withdrawing his\r\nrays from the silken hangings and the silver upon the toilet-table.\r\n\r\nLacking in incident as the day had proved at Belvoir, to Loyd Morton\r\nit had been an epoch of emotions such as he had never dreamed of\r\nrealizing.\r\n\r\nUpon leaving Belvoir, he had gone directly to his house in town, into\r\nwhich he admitted himself with a latch-key. The object of his haste\r\nwas to place himself before a portrait of his wife which hung in a\r\nroom held sacred to her memory. Here, amid a thousand mementos of the\r\nhappy past, it was his custom to sit during his leisure hours,\r\nbrooding upon the wreck that had overtaken him.\r\n\r\nTo-day, however, he entered the mortuary apartment with buoyant step,\r\nwafting a smiling kiss up at the fair-haired Gretchen that gazed upon\r\nhim from her frame above the mantel-piece. He flung wide the windows\r\nand blinds, even sweeping back the draperies, that the April sun might\r\nbeam in and rob the place of shadow.\r\n\r\nThen he placed himself before the portrait, and thus addressed it,\r\ngiving vent to his pent-up exaltation,\r\n\r\n\"I no longer beseech you to speak to me with those beloved lips,\" he\r\ncried, \"nor to smile upon me with those eyes that heaven has tinted\r\nwith its own blue! And yet I must adore your image, which, after all,\r\nis lost to me. But what care I, since your immortal soul actuates\r\nother lips to breathe your love for me, and kindles other eyes with\r\nthat same deathless love when silence falls between us? O, Paula, my\r\nidol! tell me why I should be so infinitely blessed, when other men\r\nlanguish in their bereavement? Thou knowest _now_ that I am as other\r\nmen are--as full of frailty and sin as any; then, why am I favored\r\nwith the lot of angels? O my God, it cannot be that I have died and\r\n_this_ is heaven!--this being with you and yet not seeing you, this\r\nexquisite aggravation which is mingled agony and bliss! By some\r\nstrange decree, you are with me again, yet I cannot see, I cannot\r\ntouch, you. Am I perhaps in purgatory? Or, worse, what if I should\r\nwake to find myself in a Fool's Paradise! Heaven forbid; for that\r\nwould drive me mad, and then my unbalanced spirit would wander\r\ngibbering through all eternity, and know you not! Oh, no, no, no! It\r\nis the magic of our great love that has united us in this communion,\r\nwhich ameliorates the misery of our transient separation, and I thank\r\nGod for it! Another day, and mayhap I shall be with you indeed--in the\r\nspirit, in heaven! But, oh, my love, my life, my all in all, my\r\ndivinity, never desert me! In mercy and in love remain with me until\r\nthe hour of my release; then lead me back with thee!\"\r\n\r\nThus more or less coherently he rambled on before the gazing portrait,\r\nin wild salutation and petition, until the sudden opening of the door\r\nhurled him from the heights of exaltation to earth.\r\n\r\nUpon the threshold stood his man, amazed and at the same time abashed.\r\n\r\n\"You will excuse me, sir,\" he began brokenly; \"but I had no idea you\r\nwere in the house. I heard voices up here, and I thought thieves had\r\ngot in, or--or that the place was haunted!\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose I have the right to come and go and speak in my own house\r\nas I choose?\" retorted Morton testily, conscious of his inexplicable\r\ndemeanor, and impotently furious accordingly. \"Close the blinds and\r\nwindows, and shut the room up. Have there been any calls?\"\r\n\r\n\"No end of them, sir--and letters.\"\r\n\r\nGlad to make his escape from a predicament that bordered too closely\r\nupon the ridiculous to be comfortable, Morton hastily descended to his\r\noffice. In the ante-chamber, in which he had received Hubert Effingham\r\non the preceding evening, he found ample affirmation of his man's\r\nstatement that he had been sought during his absence. The slate was\r\ncovered with names and requests, while upon a table lay a salver\r\nheaped with letters. These he mechanically examined until, at the very\r\nbottom of the heap, he came upon a missive which promptly arrested his\r\nattention. It was addressed in pencil and unsealed. A moment later and\r\nhe had possessed himself of the startling information contained\r\nwithin.\r\n\r\nHe rang the bell in haste and excitedly anticipated the advent of his\r\nman by throwing open the door into the hall.\r\n\r\n\"When was this note left?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\n\"Last evening, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"At what hour?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just before you left the house, sir, with Mr. Effingham.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Before_ I left the house!\" exclaimed Morton; \"in heaven's name, why\r\ndid you not bring it to me? It is a case of life and death! It should\r\nhave been attended to without the loss of a moment. As I could not\r\nattend to it myself, I should have sent Chalmers in my place.\"\r\n\r\nThe poor man looked panic-stricken.\r\n\r\n\"You will excuse me, sir,\" he faltered, \"but I knocked twice on the\r\nstudy-door while the messenger waited, but I got no response. I\r\nthought you couldn't come, so sent the messenger away.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why did you not give me the note before I went away with Mr.\r\nEffingham?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the truth is, sir,\" stammered the man, \"I had no idea you were\r\ngoing to leave during office-hours, so I just slipped down to finish a\r\ncup o' tea, and when I came up you were off and away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fool! Do you know that your negligence may have cost Miss Casson her\r\nlife?\"\r\n\r\n\"Casson!\" gasped the man, turning pale to the lips and staggering\r\nagainst the wall for support, \"the Lord save us, sir; she's dead!\"\r\n\r\n\"_Dead!_\" echoed Morton, in horror.\r\n\r\n\"Dead, sir! They sent round word early this morning to say that she\r\ndied at midnight sharp.\"\r\n\r\nMorton staggered into his study, slamming the door in the man's face.\r\nHe threw himself into the deep reclining-chair which Margaret Revaleon\r\nhad occupied, and pressed his head between his hands in a desperate\r\nendeavor to collect his wits.\r\n\r\nHark! was it a repeating voice, or some mad phantasy, the coinage of\r\nhis excited brain, that reproduced those thrilling words:\r\n\r\n\"You will be called to attend a dying woman,--you _are_ called,\r\nalready is the messenger here. A woman's soul is trembling upon the\r\nthreshold of eternity. If you are alone with her when that soul takes\r\nwing, my spirit will instantly take its place--and your skill will do\r\nthe rest. Accomplish the resurrection of that body and secure our\r\nfurther communion.\"\r\n\r\n_Two_ women were approaching the threshold of death and _two_\r\nmessengers were waiting to summon him while those portentous words\r\nwere being uttered! To _which_ of the two should he have gone? _Which_\r\none was intended, destined for the promised reincarnation?\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n                            \"A sense sublime\r\n    Of something far more deeply interfused,\r\n    Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns,\r\n    And the round ocean, and the living air,\r\n    And the blue sky, and in the mind of men\r\n    A motion and a spirit, that impels\r\n    All thinking things, all objects of all thought,\r\n    And rolls through all things.\"\r\n\r\nMorton roused from his passing stupor to find himself in a highly\r\nhysterical condition. He was inclined to laugh; in fact he did laugh\r\nin a mirthless way, with sobbing accent that closely resembled the act\r\nof weeping. He strove to assure himself that he had been the dupe of\r\nhis own over-taxed nerves; that his present condition was wholly due\r\nto the excessive tension of his mental powers and want of sleep. He\r\neven went so far as to smilingly pledge his presumptive happiness in a\r\ncopious dose of valerian. Thus armed with a species of Dutch courage,\r\nhe threw himself upon a lounge and sought composure. If his wife's\r\nspirit, he reasoned, were omnipresent in all conditions and under all\r\ncircumstances that pertained to him, as had been represented, and if\r\nthat spirit were anxious to be reincarnate, as he had been given to\r\nunderstand that it was, why in the name of all that was rational,\r\nshould it desert him, simply because he hastened to attend one dying\r\nwoman instead of another? What possible difference could it make which\r\ncorporeal attire it assumed? was it not reasonable to assume that a\r\nspirit, presumably clairvoyant, would pursue its affinity as the\r\nmagnet seeks the pole, and appropriate any earthly guise, since the\r\npower was granted it? Was not Romaine Effingham's body as well fitted\r\nfor its reinstatement in the flesh as another's?\r\n\r\nTrue, the late Miss Casson had possessed a certain fascination for\r\nhim, which had been commented upon before he went abroad to meet his\r\nfate, and naturally enough his wife had divined the _ci-devant_ but\r\nnow defunct spell when she took her place in his circle, and,\r\nwoman-like, had rallied him upon it.\r\n\r\n\"If I had come to you bare-footed,\" she often remarked jocosely, \"I\r\nshould not be constantly haunted by the consciousness that the fair\r\nIsabel is impatiently awaiting my shoes.\"\r\n\r\nTo which quip he invariably replied with a laugh, \"Such a suspicion\r\nwould never occur to you, my dear, if the shoes did not pinch.\"\r\n\r\nAnd upon this occasion he conjectured, with a drowsy smile, that\r\nIsabel Casson's body would have failed to offer his wife's spirit the\r\ninducements to reincarnation that Romaine's might, under the\r\ncircumstances, the beautiful Miss Effingham having been ever far\r\nremoved from any such lovers' banter. And so, thanks to the drug and\r\nhis own reasoning power, he lapsed involuntarily into sleep, the\r\nresult of excessive fatigue. When at last he awoke, he sprang to his\r\nfeet, startled at his own temerity. His hysteria had vanished, leaving\r\nhim depressed and apathetic. With a thrill he noticed that the sun,\r\nobscured by the windy clouds of the early spring evening, had crept\r\nround to the back of the house and was glimmering fitfully in at his\r\nstudy windows. The day had waned, and heaven only knew how many\r\nprecious hours he had lost.\r\n\r\nHe paused a moment, his blood halting in his veins as he strove to\r\nsurmise what might have transpired at Belvoir during his absence.\r\nFortunately for him, he had not overheard Drummond's half-implied\r\ndoubts of the morning, but in guilty consciousness of his attitude\r\ntowards Romaine's affianced lover, he instinctively felt the young\r\ngentleman to be, in all righteousness, his deadly antagonist.\r\n\r\nTen minutes later he had ordered his carriage and was being borne\r\nswiftly over the road that led to Belvoir, the invigorating breath of\r\nthe April evening blowing in upon him and soothing his perturbation,\r\ndespite himself. Consequently, as he passed through the gateway of\r\nBelvoir, that gave back that description of echo peculiar to\r\naristocratic portals and cemeteries, he drew a long breath, feeling\r\nhimself to be himself again. Even the apparition of a well-known,\r\nstalwart figure crossing the lawn from the direction of Drummond\r\nLodge, failed to materially disturb his equilibrium, since he had\r\nalready alighted before the figure had reached the garden stair\r\nleading up to the terrace.\r\n\r\nHe let himself in at the unbarred door, as he had been wont to do in\r\nthe old time when he had been more an inmate of, than visitor at, the\r\nhouse, and, finding no one to delay or question him in the shadowy\r\nhall, he mounted the stairs, and laid his hand upon the door of his\r\npatient's chamber.\r\n\r\nHe entered noiselessly, even pausing and holding his breath in\r\namazement at the vision that met his gaze.\r\n\r\nLeft alone for the moment, Romaine had arisen from her couch and had\r\ngone to one of the windows that afforded an enchanting prospect of the\r\neastern hills, cloaked in the emerald film of bourgeoning spring,\r\nvivified by the effulgence of the setting sun. She stood with the\r\nsilken drapery thrust back in her upraised hand, thus admitting the\r\nevening glow that lent a touch etherial to her lovely face and flowing\r\nattire.\r\n\r\nIt seemed like the irony of Fate that Morton should have discovered\r\nher thus, instead of Drummond; but, even with his normal faculty of\r\nobservation, Morton paused, spell-bound. He neither spoke, nor made\r\nthe slightest movement that might disturb her intent revery. He simply\r\nput the passionate yearning of his heart into one brief and mute\r\nappeal.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my darling, my Paula, my wife! Come to me of your own accord.\r\nCome to me and let me feel the clasp of your dear arms about my neck!\"\r\n\r\nWhether she experienced the strong mesmeric power of that dumb appeal,\r\nor whether her woman's instinct only warned her of his silent\r\npresence, is a question for the determination of graduates in the\r\nscience of psychology. Certain it is that she turned with a visible\r\nthrill, and came to him, the loose drapery of her sleeves falling back\r\nand exposing the exquisite symmetry of her outstretched arms. She laid\r\nthose arms about his neck, glancing up into his face with a smile, and\r\nkissed him upon the lips.\r\n\r\n\"How I have longed for you!\" she murmured; \"and what an eternity since\r\nyou left me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Paula--Paula, my own sweet love!\" he ventured breathlessly.\r\n\r\nHe stared hungrily into her upturned face, half-fearfully,\r\nhalf-confidently noting the effect of his words; but the calm smile\r\nremained unchanged, fixed upon her features as might have been the\r\nsmile of peaceful death, save that it wore the tint of life. He caught\r\nher in his arms, passionately folding her to his breast, kissing her\r\nhair, her brow, and lips.\r\n\r\nIn the next moment his quick ear detected the sound of foot-falls upon\r\nthe neighboring staircase.\r\n\r\n\"He is coming!\" he whispered in involuntary alarm. \"I promised him\r\nthat he should see you; but, oh, my love, remember that it is I, not\r\nhe, who claim you now--claim your every thought, your love wholly and\r\nentirely!\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall not forget that which is a part of my own being,\" she\r\nanswered gently. \"With you by my side, I should not fear to face Satan\r\nhimself!\"\r\n\r\nHe bore her in his arms to the lounge and tenderly placed her upon it.\r\n\r\n\"I am your physician, as well as lover,\" he murmured; \"and it is in my\r\npower to prevent your being tortured by a lengthy interview.\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled up at him reassuringly.\r\n\r\n\"Have no fear for me,\" she said. \"But--but do not leave me.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, upon the instant, Colston Drummond entered the chamber.\r\n\r\nMorton stood at the head of the couch, his body half-turned away, his\r\nface studiously averted; yet, in spite of his attitude, he was\r\nconscious that Romaine's lover had thrown himself upon his knees\r\nbeside her couch, and had possessed himself of one of her hands, which\r\nhe pressed passionately to his lips.\r\n\r\n\"Romaine, Romaine,\" he faltered in evident suspense, \"why do you turn\r\naway your head? Why do you hide your face from me? Do you not know me?\r\nIt is I, Colston; I have come home to claim you for my wife, as we\r\nagreed. Have you forgotten? In mercy, try to think, try to recall the\r\nhappy past! Oh, look at me, Romaine!\"\r\n\r\nA brief silence succeeded the eager appeal, only to be broken by a\r\nsharp gasp from Drummond.\r\n\r\n\"Great God!\" he exclaimed in an accent of horror, \"can it be that she\r\ndoes not know me? Dr. Morton, what does this mean?\"\r\n\r\nHe had regained his feet and stepped so close to Morton that his\r\nbreath fanned his cheek. Morton turned swiftly, and their glances met.\r\nSome vague instinct seemed to warn each of them that in a way they\r\nwere rivals, and for an instant they appeared to be measuring each\r\nother's strength, as for some mortal combat--Drummond suffused, as to\r\nhis handsome face, with suppressed excitement, Morton sternly calm and\r\npallid.\r\n\r\n\"Pray do not forget, Mr. Drummond,\" the latter said steadily, \"that\r\nMiss Effingham is an invalid. As her physician, I insist upon her\r\nbeing undisturbed.\"\r\n\r\nThe words, far from recalling Drummond to his senses, seemed to\r\nincrease his agitation.\r\n\r\n\"And do not forget, sir,\" he retorted, \"that my attitude towards Miss\r\nEffingham entitles me to some satisfaction, some explanation.\"\r\n\r\nMorton simply bowed his head, covertly watching the young gentleman as\r\nhe crossed the chamber. With his hand upon the door, Drummond paused\r\nand turned, whether for the desperate comfort of one more glance, or\r\nultimate word of defiance is doubtful, since at that moment Romaine\r\nhalf rose upon her couch and clasped one of Morton's hands in both her\r\nown. The significant act so maddened its beholder that the last\r\nvestige of his self-control vanished. Returning swiftly upon his\r\nsteps, he snatched a letter from his breast and held it quivering\r\nbefore the eyes of the shrinking girl.\r\n\r\n\"Romaine Effingham,\" he cried, \"look at this letter! Look at it and\r\nlet the sight of it restore you to your wits, if you have lost them!\r\nDo you recognize it? Do you remember how you wrote these lines to me\r\nwithin a month, these lines instinct with your great love, with your\r\nintense longing for me to return to you? I am willing to stake my\r\nlife that more impassioned words were never sent to absent lover.\r\nThere stands your signature! Do you deny it?\"\r\n\r\nShe covered her face with her hands and moaned.\r\n\r\n\"You remember, then?\" he added triumphantly. \"Your mind is _not_\r\nderanged, but _bewitched_!\"\r\n\r\nShe only moaned, trembling like a broken twig vibrating in the wind.\r\n\r\nThen Morton spoke with the same stony calm of voice and feature:\r\n\r\n\"You have had your say, sir,\" he said. \"I have permitted you to speak\r\nout of pity, but I am answerable to Mrs. Effingham for the welfare of\r\nher daughter, which is being jeopardized by such a tirade as this\r\nwhich you have seen fit to indulge in. I therefore request you--as her\r\nphysician, I request you to respect Miss Effingham's condition, and\r\nleave the room.\"\r\n\r\nDrummond raised his head and dealt Loyd Morton a glance which smote\r\nhim to the heart.\r\n\r\n\"I go,\" he answered. \"I leave her in peace; but as God is judge of us\r\nboth, I fail to understand why you, who have enjoyed one all-absorbing\r\nlove, and ought to be faithful to it, can have the heart to force\r\nyourself between my only love and me!\"\r\n\r\nAnd, with these significant words, he left the chamber.\r\n\r\nLoyd Morton shivered as the door closed heavily upon his departing\r\nform, and he crept to the window, raised the drapery, and stood\r\nstaring blindly out upon the darkening landscape.\r\n\r\nFor the first time since the beginning of his weird experience, the\r\nvoice of conscience asserted itself, weakening his resolution to the\r\nextent of making a partial coward of him.\r\n\r\n\"God help me!\" he mentally ejaculated; \"would to heaven that I had\r\nforeseen this disastrous complication before I entered into a covenant\r\nwith death! Far be it from me to interfere with the love and hope of\r\nany man. But what can I do now, if, as I believe, it is Paula's soul\r\nthat has returned to comfort me in my loneliness? How can I give her\r\nup to any other man to love and cherish? Were I to betray her thus,\r\noutrage her confidence in me, and doom her to a spiritual hell on\r\nearth, how could I face her when at last we meet in the life to come?\r\nHeaven have mercy upon me and save me! rescue me from this awful doubt\r\nthat the soul I love is _not_ with me, is not incarnate here; that I\r\nam the victim of some Satanic wile that grants me the power to exert\r\nan infernal magnetism to the estrangement of fond and loyal hearts! O\r\nmy God, rather let me die here and now, before I have consummated\r\nirreparable wrong!\"\r\n\r\nThe desperate thought ended in a sharp gasp that voiced the surprise\r\nand almost superstitious awe which seized upon him as he felt a\r\nslender arm coil itself softly about his neck with soothing contact of\r\ncool flesh against his feverish cheek.\r\n\r\nThe gloom had deepened to darkness within the chamber, but in the deep\r\nembrasure of the window there lurked a faint after-glow of day, that\r\nultimate flickering of our northern twilight that seems fraught alike\r\nwith hinted promise and with lingering farewell. There is a witchery\r\nabout the \"sober livery\" of that brief hour that lends itself to the\r\nimaginative soul and lays a magic spell upon the triteness of\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nHe knew that she had come to him, but for a moment he trembled in\r\nuncertainty.\r\n\r\n\"You are in doubt about me, Loyd?\" she faltered, with a perspicacity\r\nthat was the more startling by reason of her hesitation. \"You think it\r\nbest to relinquish all claim to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"What think you yourself?\" he asked in an agony of suspense.\r\n\r\n\"I am in doubt when you are.\"\r\n\r\n\"But when I am firm?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I feel that death itself cannot part us.\"\r\n\r\nHe wound his arms about her, and in return felt her hold upon him\r\ntighten with clinging trust; and thus for one supreme moment they\r\nstood.\r\n\r\n\"When you love, I love,\" she murmured; \"when you waver, I waver. I am\r\nthe slave of a magnetism of which you are the master.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush, hush!\" he gasped, assailed even with her arms about him, by the\r\ngrewsome conviction which but a minute before had impelled him to call\r\nupon heaven to end his ill-starred career; \"no, no! this is not\r\nmagnetism! Banish the thought, dear love, and henceforth believe that\r\nit is by a special dispensation of Providence that we are once more\r\nunited, never again to part!\"\r\n\r\nShe nestled closer to him and laid her sweet head upon his breast in\r\neloquent reliance.\r\n\r\n\"I believe, since you believe,\" she murmured.\r\n\r\nA moment later there sounded a cautious knocking upon the door.\r\n\r\nMorton loosened his embrace and crossed the chamber to answer the\r\nsummons.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Drummond begs Doctor Morton to join him immediately in the\r\nlibrary upon a matter of importance,\" announced the servant.\r\n\r\nMorton bowed his head in silence.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n    \"Love, lend me wings to make my purpose swift,\r\n    As thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift!\"\r\n\r\nThe portentous interview in the library was held within closed doors,\r\nand at its conclusion the two gentlemen left the house by one of the\r\ncasement windows of the room that gave upon the terrace. Through the\r\ngathered dusk they passed side by side, their blurred shadows tracking\r\nthem in the faint radiance of the young moon. Side by side they\r\ncrossed the lawn, bearing down towards the belt of woodland beyond\r\nwhich lay Drummond Lodge--two apparitions, voiceless and black. At\r\nlast the blackness of the woods embraced them and they vanished.\r\n\r\nNot until the dense umbrage of the budding trees was reached was a\r\nword exchanged between the ill-assorted pair. It was there, upon the\r\nfragrant hem of the grove, that Morton paused, removed his hat and\r\nmopped his brow, though the evening was damp and chill.\r\n\r\n\"I see no occasion for me to go farther,\" he remarked, a note of\r\nnervous irritation in his tone.\r\n\r\n\"I did not intend to bring you so far,\" replied Drummond; \"but I\r\nwished to think of your proposition; to think before I gave an answer\r\nto your--your unnatural demand.\"\r\n\r\nHis companion listened to the words, his pallid face agleam in the wan\r\ntwilight.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he muttered, \"you have arrived at some conclusion?\"\r\n\r\n\"I admit that I am curious to know the limit of your powers,\" was the\r\nreply, bitter with irony.\r\n\r\n\"I boast no special powers. I will simply try to do that which I have\r\nproposed.\"\r\n\r\nDrummond broke off a spray of dogwood blossom and tossed it away\r\nunheeded.\r\n\r\n\"You understand,\" he said sternly, \"understand thoroughly, that I\r\ninsist upon complete satisfaction in the matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"That I must have the proof and testimony which I have named.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"You speak confidently.\"\r\n\r\n\"I speak as I feel--as I have reason to speak.\"\r\n\r\n\"As you _think_ you have reason to speak,\" echoed Drummond, an ominous\r\ngloom shadowing his fierce eyes. \"Well, sir, do your best--accomplish\r\nwhat you can--then come to me at any hour of the night. You may suit\r\nyour own convenience. Between this hour and daybreak you will find a\r\nlight burning which will guide you straight to me. You will find me\r\nalone and waiting--but, mark you! if you come to me with any trickery,\r\nany fabrication, any counterfeit proof, I shall detect you in your\r\ninfamy, and shall be merciless; so beware! Likewise should you attempt\r\nto evade me in the humiliation of failure, I warn you that I shall be\r\nequally relentless.\"\r\n\r\nMorton replied in a tense tone which betrayed the struggle for\r\ncomposure that he was undergoing.\r\n\r\n\"I do not fear you,\" he said, \"your approbation or displeasure is\r\nalike a matter of indifference to me. In any case, though I admit but\r\n_one_ to be possible, I shall come to you before daybreak.\"\r\n\r\nDrummond drew up his stalwart figure to its full height and folded his\r\narms.\r\n\r\n\"Under the circumstances, then,\" he observed with a sneer, \"I should\r\nbe unreasonable were I to encroach upon another instant of your\r\nprecious time.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps his mockery was unheeded. Be that as it may, Morton had turned\r\nabruptly while he was speaking, and had begun rapidly to retrace his\r\nsteps to the mansion beyond the lawn.\r\n\r\nUpon the fringe of the wood, Colston Drummond stood watching the\r\nreceding figure until, its lineaments mingling with the pervading\r\ngloom, it was lost to sight.\r\n\r\n\"Charlatan! fool!\" he muttered. \"I have given you the rope; go hang\r\nyourself!\"\r\n\r\nHe turned upon his heel and pressed into the path that led across the\r\ncopse, through which twinkled the lights of Drummond Lodge.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he paused with clenched hands, and only the budding leaves\r\nand fronds were auditors of the groan that came, wrung from his inmost\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\n\"My God! _if_ she should fail me!\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile dinner had been announced at Belvoir. Plenty of candles had\r\nbeen lighted to dispel the gloom. The butler stood at his post before\r\nthe side-board, but as yet the four chairs placed about the table\r\nlacked occupants. The man glanced at the clock upon the mantel-piece\r\nand heaved a decorous sigh, doubtless in memory of the well-ordered\r\ndays of his late master. At last, and just as the hands of the clock\r\nmarked the half-hour after seven, Hubert Effingham appeared and\r\nrequested the \"faithful Adam\" to serve the repast.\r\n\r\n\"Doctor Morton will dine with us,\" he said, and turned to meet his\r\nmother and Morton as they entered.\r\n\r\nMother and son had indulged in no little surmise as to the sudden\r\ndisappearance of their two guests, and had delayed dinner until the\r\nlast moment on their account. Morton's return, unattended, did not\r\nserve to elucidate matters, since he did not appear to be in a\r\ncommunicative frame of mind.\r\n\r\nThe pair had met him upon the terrace, where they had been strolling\r\nto and fro in the pale moonlight, talking in lowered tones and\r\nawaiting some development in the mystery. They had descried his dark\r\nfigure as he crossed the lawn, coming from the direction of \"Drummond\r\nCopse,\" as the belt of woodland separating the estates was familiarly\r\ncalled, and, with no slight sense of curiosity, awaited his arrival at\r\nthe head of the steps. Their meeting might have seemed strained, but\r\nfor Hubert Effingham's remark, which relieved the situation.\r\n\r\n\"If the dinner is spoiled, my dear Loyd,\" he said cheerily, \"pray do\r\nnot blame the cook; when guests stray away at the dinner-hour, who is\r\nresponsible for the consequences? And, by the way, where is Colston?\r\nHave we to wait until his constitutional is over?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Drummond will not dine with us this evening,\" replied Morton,\r\nwith an indifference, the assumption of which was painfully apparent.\r\n\"And pardon me; I was in hopes that you would begin, and permit me to\r\ncatch up with you, as--as I have so frequently done.\"\r\n\r\n\"The idea of obliging Loyd to apologize for his actions,\" interposed\r\nMrs. Effingham, laughing, \"when his privileges here are the privileges\r\nof his own house! Be off with you, you Hector, and tell Anton he may\r\nserve dinner.\"\r\n\r\nThereupon she linked her arm within that of the young doctor, and\r\nglanced up into his face with an affection beyond question.\r\n\r\n\"Why should I mention your privileges in my home, my dearest boy and\r\nalmost son?\" she asked. \"Do I need to remind you of my darling\r\nMalcolm's love for you, or of the paternal fondness of that dear one\r\nwho so soon followed my boy to the grave?\"\r\n\r\nShe noted the nervous tremor of Morton's pallid lips, and hastened to\r\nremove the painful impression she had produced.\r\n\r\n\"Of course not!\" she added; \"more than ever, now, I account you a son.\r\nYou have saved Romaine, and it is the debt of a mother's gratitude\r\nthat I have to repay--if such requital be within human power. Oh, Loyd\r\ndear, you are again alone in the world! Come to me and fill the vacant\r\nplace!\"\r\n\r\n\"Of son?\" he demanded in a tone, the hoarseness of which concealed its\r\nalmost fierce eagerness.\r\n\r\n\"Of nothing less than son, you know it.\"\r\n\r\nHis dark eyes lighted with an inward fire that he was powerless to\r\nmask.\r\n\r\n\"God bless you!--mother,\" he answered, chokingly; \"perhaps the hour is\r\nnot far distant when I may ask requital for the life I have given you\r\nback, and put you to the test.\"\r\n\r\nThey had entered the lighted hall and she glanced with a slightly\r\nwondering start into his face, though the replied in the same fulness\r\nof soul,\r\n\r\n\"Bring me to the test.\"\r\n\r\nTheir entrance into the dining-room and the presence of Hubert put an\r\nend to the conversation, and dinner began, a single course of which\r\ngave ample proof that the atmosphere had cleared. Romaine was out of\r\ndanger, indeed convalescent, and the awful suspense of the last\r\ntwenty-four hours was at an end. Mother and son presided in the very\r\nbest of spirits, and Morton must have been morose indeed had he been\r\nable to withstand the contagion of their buoyant mood. Under the\r\ninfluence of their constantly reiterated gratitude for the feat which\r\nthey ascribed to his skill, of the genial atmosphere, combined with\r\nthe excellent fare and wines, he warmed while some hint of hope and\r\npeace crept back into his tortured heart. Only once did the clutch of\r\ninexorable destiny seem laid upon him, causing his blood to halt in\r\nits channels, as Hubert exuberantly exclaimed,\r\n\r\n\"I see but one way, Loyd, and only one, in which you can be repaid for\r\nsaving Romaine!\"\r\n\r\n\"Relieve my mind by informing me, Hubert,\" remarked Mrs. Effingham\r\nwith a smile; \"I confess that I have cudgelled my brains in vain.\"\r\n\r\n\"By giving him what he has saved--by giving him Romaine!\"\r\n\r\n\"And how about Colston?\" laughed the lady in high good humor.\r\n\r\n\"I did not take him into the account,\" responded the young man; \"at\r\nall events he should not object, under the circumstances.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which proves that you have never been in love, my boy.\"\r\n\r\nThey glanced at Morton, and were slightly chilled at the sternness of\r\nhis face and the intensity with which he answered,\r\n\r\n\"Were it her will, I would gladly be Romaine's servant in love as I\r\nhave been her servant in life and death.\"\r\n\r\nIt was as if a frigid wind had crossed the genial atmosphere, chilling\r\ntheir hearts as the mere passage of a current closes the sensitive\r\nblossoms of the deep sea. But the constraint was transient; they were\r\nused to Morton's moods, and ever were accustomed to make light of\r\nthem; and in the kindness of their hearts they readily imagined a\r\nscore of excuses for this particular one. The actual relief to the\r\nsituation, however, presented itself in the sudden and unexpected\r\napparition of Romaine herself upon the threshold of the dining-room.\r\nShe stood between the parted draperies, the soft folds of her robe\r\nfalling about her in the radiance of the candles.\r\n\r\nRomaine's welcome back to her accustomed place at table was full of\r\nthat exuberant congratulation natural to the situation. There was a\r\ngeneral uprising to receive and lead her to the vacant chair, which\r\nhad been set in place for Colston Drummond. Although Mrs. Effingham\r\nand Hubert simultaneously saluted the girl's wan cheeks, Romaine had\r\neyes only for Morton as he bent before her to kiss the hand she\r\ninvoluntarily outstretched to him. Those eyes, so dark and limpid,\r\nseemed fairly to embrace the young doctor with their eloquent\r\nscrutiny. A conscious flush suffused his face, while an eager, hungry\r\nlight flashed into his eyes, hitherto so dull and apathetic.\r\n\r\nRomaine sank into the vacant chair and glanced about her with a happy\r\nsigh.\r\n\r\n\"How good it seems to be well again!\" she exclaimed. \"I feel as though\r\nI had been away from you all an age. Pray, how long is it since I sat\r\nhere?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just twenty-four hours, sister mine,\" replied Hubert.\r\n\r\n\"One day, only one brief day,\" she remarked, as it were,\r\nintrospectively, \"and yet in that short space of time I have lived\r\nthrough an eternity--such an eternity!\"\r\n\r\nHer voice fell almost to a whisper, and her eyes became fixed upon\r\nspace with an indescribably dreamy inspection in their depths.\r\n\r\nAlthough the dinner was practically at an end, Hubert seated himself\r\nbeside her, watching her with an affectionate interest not unmixed\r\nwith sadness. Mrs. Effingham and Morton, however, remained standing\r\nside by side at the head of the table, and it was of the latter that\r\nthe lady inquired in a swift undertone,\r\n\r\n\"Is it not a risk for her to have left her room so soon?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think not,\" replied Morton, without removing his eyes from Romaine,\r\nupon whom they had rested intently since her appearance; \"but I do not\r\napprove of her remaining here. See for yourself! The associations of\r\nthe spot seem to be exerting some spell upon her already. Romaine,\" he\r\nsaid suddenly, perhaps in answer to the mother's anxious glance, \"if I\r\nam to be your physician until you are out of all danger, you must obey\r\nme. You were imprudent to leave your room without my permission.\"\r\n\r\nShe raised her eyes quickly, smiling in happy submission, as she\r\ninquired,\r\n\r\n\"Must I go back again? Command! I am your dutiful patient.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will go into the conservatory, if you wish,\" Morton answered. \"It\r\nis warmer there and less exposed to draughts; you shall inspect your\r\nfavorite flowers, and then, I think, we shall have you retire for the\r\nnight and rest.\"\r\n\r\nShe rose with the ready acquiescence of a docile child, and going to\r\nhim, placed her arm within his.\r\n\r\n\"Come!\" she said. \"Of all things, I would like to show you my plants;\r\nI think you have not seen them for a long, long time.\" And with an\r\nanimated smile, that somehow seemed pathetic, she led Morton away\r\nthrough the glass doors that opened from the dining-room into the\r\nspacious conservatory lying fragrant and dim in the rays of the\r\ncrescent moon.\r\n\r\nHubert had risen as Romaine left the room, and stood with his hand\r\nresting upon the back of his chair, lost in troubled thought that\r\nmirrored itself upon his expressive face; at last, with sudden\r\nresolution, he conquered his painful indecision, and coming to Mrs.\r\nEffingham's side, touched her arm.\r\n\r\n\"Mother,\" he remarked, \"Loyd is correct.\"\r\n\r\n\"Loyd is always correct,\" replied the lady in a startled way, that\r\nbelied the confidence that her words implied.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but he is correct upon one point which you and I, in our great\r\nlove for Romaine, have been trying to evade during the whole of this\r\nendless day.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, Hubert?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean that Romaine's mind _is_ affected.\"\r\n\r\n\"Merciful heaven!\" cried the mother, the ready tears glittering in her\r\nanxious eyes, \"how you utter my thoughts! My dear boy, what shall we\r\ndo if such be the case?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe it to be but a temporary aberration, and Loyd thinks so,\r\ntoo,\" replied the young man, soothingly.\r\n\r\n\"But how can we tell? O Hubert, what suspense for us!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but we must bear it bravely, mother, hoping and praying for the\r\nbest. All that we can do is to mind Loyd's commands, in regard to\r\nRomaine, to the letter. It must be our duty to see that nothing\r\ntroubles or thwarts her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, that may mean more than you think.\"\r\n\r\n\"How so?\"\r\n\r\n\"It may mean that we shall be forced to forbid Colston the house, or\r\nat least the privilege of seeing Romaine until she recovers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Colston!\" exclaimed Mrs. Effingham, in pained amazement; \"forbid\r\nColston Drummond to enter our house!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. An unfortunate scene has been enacted this afternoon in\r\nRomaine's room between Colston and Loyd--of course in Romaine's\r\npresence. Then, later, there has been something mysterious going on\r\nbetween the two men, of what import I do not know.\"\r\n\r\n\"What can it be?\"\r\n\r\n\"I say I do not know; but perhaps Loyd will confide in me. In the mean\r\ntime I have perfect confidence that he is conscientiously doing his\r\nbest for Romaine's welfare. You can see for yourself, that her\r\nconsideration even for us, her mother and brother, is second to her\r\nsudden attachment for Loyd.\"\r\n\r\nThe significance of the words failed not duly to impress Mrs.\r\nEffingham. Her slight color faded, leaving her face ashy to the very\r\nlips.\r\n\r\n\"Can you mean,\" she said, with evident effort, \"that some mysterious\r\nmental distemper has interested her in Loyd to the prejudice of\r\nColston?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is my suspicion.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think that her love has turned to Loyd?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you doubt it?\"\r\n\r\n\"What would be the consequences of her return to reason?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mother dear,\" replied Hubert Effingham, manfully, \"we had better not\r\ntorment ourselves with considerations for the future; we have our\r\nhands full with the present.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Romaine and Morton had wandered out of ear-shot of this\r\nsignificant conversation, into the depths of the conservatory. They\r\nhad paused beneath a luxuriant _lapageria_, and the girl had raised\r\ncaressing hands, drawing downward a cluster of its frosty bells to her\r\nlips.\r\n\r\nThe startling likeness in tint between the wan face and the ghostly\r\nblossoms, as they gleamed side by side in the moonlight, so painfully\r\nsuggested the sculptured pallor of death, that Morton caught her hands\r\nin his and drew her quickly into his embrace, as he would snatch her\r\nfrom the brink of the grave. She resigned herself to his clasp, almost\r\nrough in its passion, without a tremor, while she glanced with a\r\nwondering smile up into his face.\r\n\r\n\"I associate those cold, scentless flowers with a certain funeral,\" he\r\nsaid with a shudder that caused her to nestle involuntarily closer to\r\nhim; \"I saw them near you once, and God knows I would never see them\r\nso placed again!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I have worn them in my hair,\" she said, \"and they were thought\r\nbeautiful with my white lace gown.\"\r\n\r\n\"They were laid upon your breast when I saw them last,\" he muttered,\r\n\"and they were cut from this very vine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed? I do not recollect.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, and I would not have you recollect that time, since we are united\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\n\"United again!\" she echoed dreamily. \"O Loyd, teach me to understand\r\nhow we have ever been separated!\"\r\n\r\n\"Rather let me teach you how fondly I love you,\" he whispered; \"let me\r\nconvince you that every heart-throb of ours distances the past--the\r\ndead past and its shadows. Let your very soul be witness to my avowal\r\nwhen I tell you that I love you! Paula, I love you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Paula!\"\r\n\r\nShe spoke the name after him in no surprise, with no intonation of\r\nperplexity. It left her lips lingeringly, as though its sound was\r\npleasing to her ear.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Paula,\" he answered eagerly; \"you are Paula, Paula to me, but\r\nRomaine to the rest of the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"How strange,\" she faltered with that dreamy smile, as if fascinated.\r\n\r\n\"But you comprehend,\" he insisted--\"you appreciate the distinction?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Answer to every name in Christendom, if you will, save Paula; you are\r\nPaula alone for _me_!\"\r\n\r\nHis impassioned emphasis seemed to charm her. Her rapt gaze enveloped\r\nhis head as she lay in his arms, and there was a smile of ineffable\r\nserenity upon her lips.\r\n\r\n\"How you love that name!\" she murmured.\r\n\r\n\"_You_ taught me to love it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must have, since you say so.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are Paula.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am Paula,\" she replied as one echoes a dictation; then, with a\r\nhalf-regretful sigh, \"What would I not give to be able to recall the\r\npast!\"\r\n\r\n\"You will recall everything in due time,\" he said soothingly; \"I will\r\nhelp you.\"\r\n\r\n\"After all,\" she said after a pause, \"what is the past, compared with\r\nthe present? It seems like an earth-life which I have left behind; the\r\npresent is heaven.\"\r\n\r\n\"Paula, my own true darling!\" he parted in ecstasy, \"you recognize me;\r\nyou love me!\"\r\n\r\n\"I love you, Loyd.\"\r\n\r\nHe bent his head to kiss the calmly smiling lips, when she raised her\r\nhand to stroke, with fond caress, his hair.\r\n\r\nA flash like miniature lightning dazed his sight as her hand passed\r\nupward; it was simply the gleam of a diamond upon her finger; but\r\nthrough its white sheen peered the face of Colston Drummond, distorted\r\nwith a grimace of mocking warning, and he reeled from his seventh\r\nheaven to earth, felled by that tiny shaft.\r\n\r\nHe loosened his hold upon her, and caught her hand, riveting his\r\nburning eyes upon the gem, that returned the glare with flashes of\r\nruby fire.\r\n\r\n\"You must not wear this ring!\" he exclaimed; \"I cannot bear to see it\r\nupon your dear hand.\"\r\n\r\nHer startled glance left his face and rested upon the exquisite jewel.\r\n\r\n\"You do not like the ring?\" she inquired in a puzzled way.\r\n\r\n\"It is not a question of my like or dislike,\" he replied with\r\nincreasing eagerness, almost with impatience. \"_I_ did not place it\r\nupon your finger; it does not belong to you, Paula.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, then take it away!\" she cried, hastily twisting off the circlet;\r\n\"I hate it now, although I thought it so beautiful.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was the utter absence of regret in her tone that brought\r\nthat triumphant glitter to his eyes, as he accepted the ring and\r\nslipped it upon the little finger of his left hand.\r\n\r\n\"It shall return whence it came,\" he said unsteadily. \"It shall\r\ntrouble you no more; but in its stead you shall wear this ring, these\r\npearls. Paula, do you not recognize them?\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he produced a plain gold hoop, set with three perfect\r\npearls, and held it before her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Pearls!\" she murmured sadly; \"pearls are ill-fated; they mean tears.\"\r\n\r\nHe cast his arm about her waist and drew her to him, still holding the\r\nring within range of her vision.\r\n\r\n\"All portents, all auguries, all superstitions fail in our case!\" he\r\ncried exultantly. \"We are exempt from all baleful influences now!\r\nThese pearls may _once_ have signified tears, but now there are no\r\nmore tears whence they came; they are petrified, and symbolize our\r\nhappy reunion. In this supreme moment of our love, try to\r\nrecollect--Paula, do you not recognize these pearls?\"\r\n\r\nA spasm of actual pain crossed the beautiful face, the result of\r\nintense mental exertion.\r\n\r\n\"O Loyd, I cannot recollect!\" she faltered piteously; \"and yet--. Did\r\nyou not promise to help me to recall the past?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my darling!\" he exclaimed, his passion exceeding all bounds;\r\n\"and I will fulfil that promise when we have wearied of the blessed\r\npresent! A new promise I will make you here and now, and that is never\r\nagain to torture you with unavailing considerations; only tell me once\r\nagain that you love me with all your renewed strength, with all your\r\npurified soul!\"\r\n\r\nShe raised her arms and wound them about his neck.\r\n\r\n\"Loyd, I love you,\" she answered steadily; \"I love you--love you as\r\nthe angels in heaven love!\"\r\n\r\n\"Of whom you are one!\"\r\n\r\nHe kissed her upon the lips--a long, rapturous kiss, thrilling with\r\nthe welcome of his yearning heart; with such rapture only could he\r\nhave kissed the one who had been his bride, returned to him from the\r\nimminence of some awful danger or from the shadow of the grave.\r\n\r\nAs such, and in all good faith, he kissed the woman lying in his arms,\r\nin all reason believing her his loved and lost one sent back to him\r\nfrom the vague realms of eternity.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he raised his head and looked into her face with something\r\nakin to fright, actuated doubtless by the shadow of a last doubt upon\r\nhis certitude; as a fleeting remnant of cloud-rack after a night of\r\nstorm will sometimes fleck the serenity of a perfect dawn.\r\n\r\nWould there be a blush upon her cheek after that impassioned salute?\r\nAnd, if there were, would not it portend an agitation born of maiden\r\nmodesty? His suspicious heart assured him that no such tell-tale hue\r\ndyes the brow in holy wedlock. And he could have cried aloud in his\r\nexceeding joy to find the sweet face as untinged as the ghostly\r\nflower-bells that hung above it.\r\n\r\nHe placed the ring of pearls upon her finger whence the flashing\r\ndiamond had been removed, and kissed it into place; and she, with fond\r\nhumility, received the kiss from the jewelled pledge, and returned it\r\nto his lips.\r\n\r\nThen they passed, with their arms entwined about each other, through\r\nthe dimly lighted rooms and up the stairs to the chamber, where he\r\nsurrendered her into the care of her waiting-maid.\r\n\r\n\"You will not leave the house to-night?\" she murmured, as their hands\r\nunclasped at the threshold.\r\n\r\n\"Not to-night,\" he answered softly, \"nor ever, till you go with me!\"\r\n\r\nFor the instant he forgot his obligation to Colston Drummond that\r\nnight; but, when her chamber-door had closed and the diamond upon his\r\nhand flashed a defiant ray at the lamp upon the newel-post, he\r\nbethought himself of his inevitable engagement. However, he did not\r\nblench.\r\n\r\n\"I am master of the ring!\" he murmured in triumph. \"One more effort,\r\nand I go to Drummond Lodge within the hour, prepared to remove the\r\nlast impediment from my path!\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment he descried the figure of Mrs. Effingham crossing the\r\nhall below in the direction of the library. With rapid steps he\r\ndescended the stairs and followed her. He was in search of her, since\r\nfrom her hand must come the final weapon destined to silence his\r\nrival.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n                        \"No, no, although\r\n    The air of Paradise did fan the house,\r\n    And angels offic'd all: I will be gone--\r\n    ... Come, night; end, day!\r\n    For with the dark, poor thief, I'll steal away.\"\r\n\r\nWhether or not he entertained decided views regarding the power of his\r\npersonal magnetism over Romaine, it is certain that Morton felt no\r\nperturbation, no uncertainty of touch, in his management of her. Loth,\r\nas we have seen him, to admitting that he possessed any so-called\r\nmesmerism, he was convinced that he held the key to her volition, and\r\nthat he need have no further anxiety on that score. Come what might,\r\nno matter what contingency might arise, he was persuaded that she\r\nwould second his wishes, would obey him in any event. Why should it\r\nnot be so if, as he strove to believe--nay, as he was obliged to\r\nbelieve or perish--she were actuated by the spirit of his wife?\r\nDoubtless he would have been stronger in his belief if that belief had\r\nnot resorted to the make-shift of interrogation. He was vaguely\r\nconscious of the weakness, of the masked doubt, that a question\r\nimplies--especially when it is a question of faith; and yet his very\r\ninability to answer such question satisfactorily lent him a species of\r\nDutch courage that materially assisted him to tread his dubious way.\r\nAs the belated way-farer whistles in the night or affrightedly calls\r\nupon his common-sense to assign suspicious sounds to the harmlessness\r\nof natural causes, so he groped his way, fondly believing the darkness\r\nlight, satisfied if an unanswered query dispelled a doubt.\r\n\r\nIf, then, he experienced no uneasiness as regarded his management of\r\nRomaine, he was forced to admit great apprehension as to the\r\nsuccessful control of Mrs. Effingham at the decisive moment. Granting\r\nhis power of magnetism over the daughter, he had reason seriously to\r\ndoubt the virtue of his occult gifts if applied to the mother.\r\n\r\nSomething of this moral hesitancy must have mirrored itself upon his\r\ncountenance as he thrust aside the drapery that concealed the library\r\ndoor and found himself in the presence of the lady.\r\n\r\nSerena Effingham had seated herself at the writing-table, arranged\r\npaper, and taken pen in hand; but, as the sound of Morton's footsteps\r\nreached her, she hastily dropped the pen and removed a tiny rose\r\ncolored shade from the candle, the better to scan the intruder's face.\r\n\r\n\"I disturb you,\" he said shortly, in a tone that promptly secured her\r\ncurious attention.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she answered; \"as you see, I am not engaged, I have not begun to\r\nwrite. What is it, Loyd? You have something of importance to say to\r\nme?\"\r\n\r\nShe half rose as she spoke, but he motioned her back to her seat.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, something of importance to say,\" he replied; \"a request to ask,\r\nwhich you can grant nowhere so well as here, since you must write.\"\r\n\r\n\"Write--what? To whom?\"\r\n\r\n\"To Mr. Drummond.\"\r\n\r\n\"To Colston! He may be here during the evening; I do not doubt he will\r\nbe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Colston Drummond will not call this evening.\"\r\n\r\nHubert's insinuations, together with the mysterious behavior of the\r\ntwo men earlier in the evening, recurred to her mind with unpleasant\r\nvividness; yet she hesitated to divulge alike her son's and her own\r\ninvoluntary espionage upon their guests. Consequently she had recourse\r\nto temporization for present safety.\r\n\r\n\"Colston would be remiss in his duty if he failed to inquire for\r\nRomaine before he slept,\" she remarked nervously. \"Whatever may be his\r\nfaults--and he has as few as any man I know--indifference is not one\r\nof them; at least, indifference as regards those he loves.\"\r\n\r\nIt was like her valiantly to defend the absent, and she spoke from her\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nMorton watched her with his soul in his eyes, though he turned a shade\r\nmore pallid, while the lines about his lips grew more tense as each\r\nword of hers broke the silence.\r\n\r\n\"Why should you defend him?\" he asked almost harshly.\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" she faltered, at a loss for words.\r\n\r\n\"Such defence as yours implies some suspicion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because it was wholly unprovoked.\"\r\n\r\n\"Loyd,\" the lady exclaimed, \"you dislike Colston!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should I?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"No! He is almost a stranger to me; I am not called upon either to\r\nlike or dislike him. I do not belong to his sphere in life; he has\r\nsimply crossed mine as a thousand and one persons meet me\r\nprofessionally and part, never to meet again.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you are likely to meet him frequently in the future.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think not. I confess that I am not so completely indifferent to his\r\nwelfare as to hope he might some day have need of my services, which\r\nwould be the only opportunity we could have of meeting.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Effingham bit her lip to conceal some rising emotion, and toyed\r\nabsently with the pen.\r\n\r\n\"Let us dismiss him from our thoughts for the present,\" she said with\r\na sigh, \"and attend to your request.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would willingly comply,\" Morton remarked, \"but unfortunately we\r\ncannot dismiss Mr. Drummond, since he is intimately connected with my\r\nrequest.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned a swift, startled glance upon the speaker.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he continued, coming close to the table and leaning above it;\r\n\"I wish you to write to Mr. Drummond, forbidding him to come here--for\r\nthe present; at least, forbid him to intrude upon Romaine until she is\r\nstronger and better able to bear his importunity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Loyd! what can you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly what I say. Either Mr. Drummond vacates the field to me, or I\r\nvacate the field to Mr. Drummond and such other physician as you may\r\nchoose to call in. I cannot, and will not, suffer my efforts to be\r\nbalked by his interference. You have placed Romaine in my charge to\r\ncure, and I will do my utmost to secure the desired end so long as I\r\nam undisturbed; any physician demands so much. If you consider me\r\nunreasonable, I beg you to say so frankly. No candid opinion, honestly\r\nuttered, ever gave offence or caused a breach in friendship. At all\r\nevents, it shall not in my case.\"\r\n\r\nThe heroism of his words was belied by his tone, the expression of his\r\nface, his very attitude.\r\n\r\nIf Colston Drummond's rights at Belvoir were maintained in spite of\r\nMorton's semi-truthful plea, the day would be lost to him, and he knew\r\nit. If Drummond held his ground, he must retreat. He felt the solid\r\nearth beneath him changing to a shifting quick-sand, from which only a\r\nmiracle could save him. If Drummond were restored to Romaine, he must\r\nleave her, and, in leaving her, leave that chimerical love to which he\r\nhad become enslaved, abandon his spirit-wife--and go mad, for aught he\r\nknew to the contrary.\r\n\r\nThe suspense of that supreme moment aged him appreciably, while the\r\nreaction that succeeded well-nigh deprived him of self-control.\r\n\r\nHe could have cried aloud in the exuberance of his joy, could have\r\nflung himself upon the earth, or indulged in any other fantastic mode\r\nof relief when at last Mrs. Effingham tremulously replied,\r\n\r\n\"Come what may, you shall remain in command here. O Loyd, do not\r\ndesert us in this the eleventh hour of our anxiety! In heaven's name,\r\nstand by us until your good work is accomplished! You have dragged\r\nRomaine back from the threshold of death; sustain her until the\r\nthreatening portals are closed and she is safe!\"\r\n\r\nShe rose as she spoke, with outstretched arms, and he hastened to her\r\nto receive her embrace.\r\n\r\nShe clung to him hysterically for a moment, then sank into her chair\r\nand with an effort caught up the pen in her trembling fingers.\r\n\r\n\"Dictate--I will write,\" she faltered sobbingly.\r\n\r\nIt was Morton's very good fortune that Mrs. Effingham never so much as\r\ndreamed of suspecting his perfect disinterestedness in her daughter's\r\ncause. In intrusting Romaine's life to his care, she placed in his\r\nkeeping that which she considered infinitely more precious than the\r\nsalvation of her own immortal soul, since she unhesitatingly\r\nconsidered her welfare here and hereafter as second to that of her\r\nchildren, such was the perfection of her maternal self-denial. From\r\nlong association with her, Morton was well aware of this fact;\r\nconsequently it was from prudential motives that he stepped behind her\r\nchair to conceal the guilty triumph that distorted his countenance.\r\nHad she seen his face at that moment, the depth of his deceit would\r\nhave been instantly apparent to her, and this he was wise enough to\r\nknow. Her woman's instinct would have warned her that he did not love\r\nRomaine for herself, that he was actuated in his devotion by some\r\nulterior motive in which Romaine held no share. At least, he knew such\r\nto be the case, knew that his success in the future depended upon his\r\nkeeping that knowledge an inviolate secret. He was well aware that the\r\ntreason against Colston Drummond was vividly depicted upon his face,\r\nand that in perfect concealment of it resided his only hope of further\r\ncommunion with the spirit of his wife, that reincarnation in which he\r\nnow as devoutly believed, as he believed in his own existence.\r\n\r\nBe it said in his favor that he was not wholly selfish in his conduct,\r\nnotwithstanding the insatiable yearning of his soul for the affinity\r\nfrom which he had been separated, since he felt himself to be\r\nresponsible for having summoned that spirit back to earth, for having\r\nconjured it from the realms of bliss through the spell of his great\r\nlove, even overcoming its reluctance to return by his importunity;\r\nbut, having succeeded in his invocation, having secured the\r\nreincarnation, how could he abandon the imprisoned spirit? What right\r\nhad he to leave it to pine among strangers?\r\n\r\nWhat was the spirit of his wife to Drummond, or Drummond to the spirit\r\nof his wife? They had never met upon earth, and now, wrapped in a veil\r\nof invisibility, how could that spirit hope for the sympathy and love\r\nupon which it had fed, and for the renewal of which it had returned to\r\nearth?\r\n\r\nCould he in duty, in honor, in love, desert the habitation which that\r\nblessed spirit had chosen, and leave it enslaved to a doom beside\r\nwhich total annihilation would seem paradise?\r\n\r\nA thousand times, no! As the bonds of wedlock had made him responsible\r\nfor the welfare of his wife, even so had this covenant with death\r\nrendered him accountable for the peace of her spirit.\r\n\r\nSuch was his self-acquittal for the high-handed deceit which he was\r\npractising upon his best of friends.\r\n\r\nA portion at least of this defence sped involuntarily through his mind\r\nas he stood behind Mrs. Effingham's chair; and, thanks to it, he was\r\nable to regain some measure of composure, so that, when she faintly\r\nrepeated the request that he should dictate the letter to Drummond, he\r\nreplied with a reasonable degree of command,\r\n\r\n\"Write as your heart dictates.\"\r\n\r\n\"My heart fails me,\" she answered piteously. \"I can find no words in\r\nwhich to forbid the man, who was to have been my son-in-law within the\r\nmonth, to enter my house.\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Morton then as if the threatening quick-sands were\r\ncreeping about his feet again. If he failed to secure this dismissal,\r\nall would be lost.\r\n\r\nHe might go to Drummond with the ring, feeling himself well armed, but\r\na vulnerable point would still be exposed as long as Drummond could\r\nfreely seek Mrs. Effingham and demand an explanation. Perfect success\r\nto his scheme was in view, and he must secure it at all hazards!\r\n\r\nHe stepped from his concealment and boldly faced the lady, a horn of\r\nthe bull in either hand.\r\n\r\n\"Believe me, Mrs. Effingham,\" he said sternly, \"this is no\r\nchild's-play; we have arrived at a decisive moment, which is not to be\r\ngainsaid. Permit me to present the question from another point of\r\nview. Suppose that I had failed in my management of Romaine's case;\r\nthat you saw her steadily growing worse under my treatment instead of\r\nbetter; that you were satisfied that I was mistaken and surely\r\ncourting death for her; would you not dismiss me ere it was too late,\r\nand summon one whose skill could save your child? Answer me that!\"\r\n\r\n\"O Loyd!\" she cried, \"how can you ask me? How can you find it in your\r\nheart to torture me so?\"\r\n\r\n\"And how can you place impediments in the way of my saving Romaine? I\r\nam simply amazed that you will run any risk where Romaine is\r\nconcerned. As I said before, I now repeat--either Mr. Drummond assumes\r\ndirection here, or I do; it is for you to choose between us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I beseech you, do not be unreasonable, Loyd; you are the physician.\r\nHave I not given you every proof of my confidence? Pursue your way\r\nundisturbed.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is out of the question,\" he answered steadily, \"out of the\r\nquestion, while Mr. Drummond is permitted to come here. His influence\r\nupon Romaine in her present sensitive condition is disastrous. If he\r\ncomes here, he will insist upon seeing her; and, if she sees him, I\r\nwill not answer for the consequences. I grant you that the gentleman\r\nis not to blame for the baleful influence he exerts--indeed, I\r\nentirely exonerate him; but the fact remains that, for some mysterious\r\nreason, Romaine is reduced almost to frenzy at the very sight of him.\r\nHad you been in her chamber this afternoon when he forced an entrance\r\nthere and defied my authority, you would have been satisfied that your\r\ndaughter's life is a matter of a few hours' duration if she is left to\r\nhis mercy!\"\r\n\r\nIt was a bold stroke, and it struck home.\r\n\r\nHubert's hint of the \"unfortunate scene\" that had been enacted in\r\nRomaine's presence that afternoon recurred to Mrs. Effingham's mind\r\nmost opportunely for Morton. Without further parley, she drew a sheet\r\nof paper to her, caught up the pen, and wrote in breathless haste the\r\nfollowing entreaty:\r\n\r\n    \"MY DEAR COLSTON: I beg you to appreciate the depth of my\r\n    solicitude for Romaine, when I tell you that I am more than\r\n    willing to assume all the blame for the pain I am forced to\r\n    inflict upon you. You already know something of the critical\r\n    condition of my darling child; and yet I venture to say that\r\n    it is far more critical than you suspect. Complete rest and\r\n    total freedom from every description of excitement are\r\n    indispensable to her recovery. I shall keep her strictly\r\n    removed from all social intrusion, even of the most intimate\r\n    kind; and I must beg you, for the present, not to attempt to\r\n    see her. Indeed, I will so far hazard the endurance of your\r\n    friendship and love for me as to beseech you not even to come\r\n    to the house until she is out of all danger. You may deem me a\r\n    fanatic in my maternal anxiety--perhaps I am; but nevertheless\r\n    I ask you to respect a mother's wishes and second a mother's\r\n    prayers. I take this, possibly unwarrantable, step entirely\r\n    upon my own responsibility, persuaded that your dear, noble\r\n    heart will sympathize with and understand me. Hubert shall\r\n    bring you daily tidings of our dear one; and, in the hope that\r\n    this moral quarantine may be of brief duration, believe me,\r\n\r\n                    \"Ever your fondly attached friend,\r\n                                        SERENA EFFINGHAM.\"\r\n\r\nThe manner in which she reached her signature suggested the broken\r\ngait of an exhausted animal that has been lashed almost beyond\r\nendurance, yet accomplishes the behest of its master with its ultimate\r\ngasp. The pen fell from her nerveless hand, and she sank back in her\r\nchair with a quivering sigh.\r\n\r\n\"Read what I have written,\" she gasped. \"It may be utterly\r\nunintelligible.\"\r\n\r\nFor answer, Morton folded the sheet and placed it in an envelope.\r\n\r\n\"Address this, if you please,\" he said.\r\n\r\nShe obeyed his request, limply forcing herself to make the effort;\r\nand, as the pen once more fell from her fingers, she glanced up at him\r\nwith a haggard piteousness in her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Will you not read what I have written?\" she asked again.\r\n\r\n\"I see no reason why I should,\" he answered. \"I have no wish to\r\nintrude. You are simply doing your duty towards your daughter; such a\r\nproceeding is not open to criticism.\"\r\n\r\n\"I only hope and pray that Colston will regard my attitude in the same\r\nmagnanimous light,\" she sighed, taking a little heart at his words.\r\n\r\n\"He will if he is truly a lover and a gentleman,\" was the daring\r\nreply.\r\n\r\nMrs. Effingham rose and, crossing the room, opened one of the\r\ncasements to admit a breath of the cool night air; and at that moment\r\na clock somewhere about the house chimed ten.\r\n\r\n\"It is so late,\" she remarked sadly, \"that there is little danger of\r\npoor Colston's intruding upon us to-night. We may as well defer\r\nsending the note until to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nShe was looking absently forth upon the engloomed landscape, to where,\r\nbeyond the crest of the low-lying hills, the blood-red segment of the\r\nmoon was sinking to rest; consequently she failed to note the inward\r\nfire that flashed up in Morton's haggard eyes as he hastened to reply,\r\n\r\n\"I will take a short walk before I sleep, as is my custom, and leave\r\nthe note at Drummond Lodge.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned with an apprehensive start towards the writing-table, as if\r\nto claim the note, perhaps with a view to its destruction; but it had\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nDivining her intention, Morton touched his breast. \"It is here,\" he\r\nsaid, \"you may trust me to deliver it safely. Romaine has requested me\r\nto remain here over night,\" he added, going towards the door that\r\nopened upon the hall, \"and I must respect her wish. Doubtless I shall\r\nfind Hubert up when I return.\"\r\n\r\nHe was about to leave the room, when the lady extended her arms and he\r\nwas obliged to return and receive her embrace.\r\n\r\n\"Good-night,\" she murmured; \"I shall look in at Romaine and then\r\nretire; for I am completely worn out with the events of this day.\r\nGood-night, Loyd. Ah, my dear boy! you little know what comfort it is\r\nto have you to depend upon. I have trusted you with Romaine's precious\r\nlife, and you have not failed me; now I intrust to your keeping her\r\nfuture welfare and happiness. Be faithful. God bless you. Good-night!\"\r\n\r\nWords of strong significance they seemed to Morton, in his exalted\r\nmood. Could it be that they implied a suspicion of apostasy on his\r\npart?\r\n\r\nLike many another constitutionally upright man, laboring in strained\r\ncircumstances, he felt his \"conscience hanging about the neck of his\r\nheart;\" and, like many another good man, overwhelmed by the force of\r\ncircumstances, he left himself no time to listen to that conscience.\r\nHe grasped his hat and hurried out into the night. As he passed one of\r\nthe uncurtained windows of the drawing-room, whence a belt of light\r\nfell out upon the terrace from the shaded lamps within, he paused and\r\nhalf involuntarily drew Mrs. Effingham's letter to Drummond from his\r\npocket. He had not sealed it, and, as he drew the folded sheet from\r\nits envelope, he experienced a twinge of shame-faced regret that he\r\nhad not read it in the lady's presence, as she had besought him to do.\r\nThe desire--nay, the imperative necessity--had been with him at the\r\ntime to satisfy himself to what extent her words had coincided with\r\nhis requirements; but somehow he could not have brought himself to\r\nread the missive with her confiding eyes resting upon him.\r\n\r\nNow, however, with an assurance born of the encompassing darkness, his\r\neyes flew over the lines, gathering a gleam of hungry satisfaction in\r\ntheir depths as they read.\r\n\r\n\"'Indeed, I will so far hazard the endurance of your friendship and\r\nlove for me as to beseech you not even to come to the house until she\r\nis out of all danger,'\" he read, almost audibly. \"Good! good! Nothing\r\ncould be better! We are safe from his intrusion, at least for the\r\nprecious present! Ah,\" he concluded, with savage, mirthless humor, \"I\r\nam greatly mistaken in his high-mettle if she has not made him his\r\nquietus with a bare bodkin!\"\r\n\r\nHe returned the letter to his pocket and hurried away to the steps\r\nthat led down to the lawn, casting one backward, furtive glance at the\r\nlighted windows.\r\n\r\nFair-haired Achilles, armed cap-a-pie, could not have led his troops\r\nagainst Troy with more perfect faith in his invulnerability, in more\r\nprofound assurance of his powers to vanquish, than did Morton hasten\r\nthrough the dew-drenched woodland that separated Belvoir from Drummond\r\nLodge. He gave no heed to the clinging briers, no thought to the roots\r\nand stubble that vainly essayed to bar his passage. It is even\r\ndoubtful if he kept to the slightly defined path; there was a single\r\nlight aglow beyond the trees, towards which he bore with feverish\r\nhaste. He had lost all sense of physical discomfort or opposition; it\r\nwas as if, discarnate, his spirit winged impetuous flight towards the\r\ngoal of its desires.\r\n\r\nAs he approached the dim mansion lying low amidst dense shrubbery, he\r\ndescried a small star set low and somewhat in advance of the signal\r\nlight, like some strange winged glow-worm poised in air. Soon his\r\neager eyes were able to detach from the environing gloom the outlines\r\nof a tall man, standing with folded arms, a lighted cigar between his\r\nlips. Some instinct peculiar to his excited condition informed Morton\r\nthat the solitary figure was that of Colston Drummond--long before\r\nrecognition was possible.\r\n\r\n\"So he, too, has suffered an anxious moment!\" he thought, an\r\noverpowering throb of triumph almost suffocating him.\r\n\r\nA minute later the two men stood confronting each other.\r\n\r\nThe moon had set, and in the darkness a brisk, chill wind was busy\r\namong the tree-tops. Near by an owl hooted dismally, and receiving\r\nanswer from the distance, hooted again in eerie ululation.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" queried Drummond, with difficulty disguising a thrill of\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n\"I have kept my appointment,\" answered Morton, \"earlier than I\r\nthought; earlier, probably, than you expected me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am the bearer of a message--a note from Mrs. Effingham.\"\r\n\r\n\"Follow me.\"\r\n\r\nDrummond threw away his cigar and led the way across the sodden grass\r\nto the open casement window, within which burned the light. It was a\r\ncharming room, decorated with trophies of the chase. From floor to\r\nceiling the walls were draped with fish-seines festooned upon antlers.\r\nGroups of arms from every quarter of the globe, glistened upon the\r\nvarious panels, while ancient and modern panoplies scintillated in\r\nevery nook and corner. Beside a table shrouded in dull gray velvet,\r\nand littered with books, papers, and smoking-materials, Drummond\r\npaused and turned to face the shadow that followed him.\r\n\r\nNo word was exchanged, while in breathless silence he accepted and\r\nread to its close the letter which Morton had brought. Without comment\r\nhe laid it upon the table, then bent his keen, stern glance upon the\r\nmessenger.\r\n\r\n\"This letter is but a part of our compact,\" he said, each distinctly\r\nuttered word cutting the silence like a knife.\r\n\r\n\"I agreed to bring you this letter from Mrs. Effingham,\" Morton\r\nanswered, defiantly, \"and your engagement-ring from\"--\r\n\r\n\"Well? You have brought it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have.\"\r\n\r\nDrummond recoiled a step, casting out his hand behind him and grasping\r\nthe table for support.\r\n\r\n\"Great God!\" burst from his tensely drawn lips; \"I--I\"--\r\n\r\n\"You recognize the ring?\"\r\n\r\nMorton had slipped the circlet from his finger and held it before\r\nDrummond's eyes, twinkling in the lamp-light.\r\n\r\n\"This is some jugglery!\" gasped the wretched man; \"some infernal\r\nwitchcraft! I--I refuse to\"--\r\n\r\n\"This is your ring!\"\r\n\r\nA pause of awful import ensued, broken only by the weird hubbubboo of\r\nthe owls.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Drummond,\" Morton continued at length, his voice fairly startling\r\nthe silence, \"I have fulfilled my part of the compact. I have brought\r\nyou undeniable proof that for the present, at all events, your\r\nattentions to Miss Effingham are\"--\r\n\r\n\"Silence!\" gasped Drummond, between his ghastly lips.\r\n\r\n\"Are distasteful to her,\" proceeded Morton, steadily, but with no note\r\nof triumph in his tone. \"Your part of the compact involves your\r\nrelinquishing all claim upon Belvoir, even as a visitor. I have\r\naccomplished my part; as a gentleman you\"--\r\n\r\n\"Silence!\" thundered Drummond, his whole being vibrant with an\r\novermastering fury. \"Out of my sight! or by the living God I will not\r\nbe responsible for what I may do! Never fear that I shall not abide by\r\nmy part of the compact! But as there is justice in heaven, I will\r\nnever rest until I have probed this damnable mystery to the heart!\r\nNow, go! before the sight of you reduces me to a ravening beast! Go,\r\nbefore I tear your heart out, and by drawing your blood, deprive you\r\nof the power of sorcery! Out of my sight!\"\r\n\r\nMorton's return to Belvoir was effected at the height of his speed.\r\nHis interview with Drummond had unmanned him; while the conscience\r\nthat hung about the neck of his heart seemed to be strangling his life\r\nout in its deadly clutch. The owls, winging breast to breast, pursued\r\nhim, and even the very wind caught up their vague denunciation and\r\nhurled it about his ears. Only the twinkling lights of Belvoir\r\nrecalled him from the verge of madness, from the black Gehenna of his\r\naccusing soul.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n    \"Have I caught thee, my heavenly jewel? Why, now let me die,\r\n    for I have liv'd long enough: this is the period of my\r\n    ambition.\"\r\n\r\nRomaine Effingham's convalescence was as rapid as the advent of summer\r\nthat year. As the brief April days glided into May, she grew strong\r\nand well again; sound physically, at all events. Her mental condition\r\nremained a matter of conjecture to those who watched her with anxious\r\nhearts. Apparently she was perfectly herself, save for her infatuation\r\nfor Morton which, after all, was scarcely a flattering view of the\r\ncase to take. Naturally there was no reason why she should not fall in\r\nlove with the young physician, setting Drummond's undeniable claims\r\naside; but that Drummond should be set aside, for no apparent cause,\r\nin favor of Morton, argued a distemper which perhaps might most easily\r\nbe placed to the account of mental aberration. It was evident that\r\nsomething must be seriously wrong with her that she should wholly and\r\ncompletely ignore the existence of her affianced lover. She never\r\nmentioned him, while if, in the common course of conversation his name\r\nchanced to be uttered, which was not often the case for obvious\r\nreasons, she maintained as unaffected an indifference as if the name\r\nof some stranger, in whom by no chance could she be interested, had\r\nbeen called in question.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course Mrs. Effingham indulged in a purely sentimental\r\nview of the singular situation. If she were not betrayed into saying\r\nso, in so many words, she was convinced that as Romaine's health\r\nstrengthened, her mind would resume its sovereignty, her former\r\npredilections and affections would duly re-assert themselves, and as a\r\nconsequence, her dormant love for Drummond would awake and claim its\r\nidol, which had simply suffered temporary eclipse, not obliteration.\r\nThe good lady felt persuaded that Romaine's love for her betrothed was\r\ndormant, not defunct.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, man-like, Hubert Effingham was of opinion--and,\r\ntrue son of his father, he had the courage of his opinions--that\r\neither his sister's mind was hopelessly deranged, her unwarrantable\r\nneglect of Drummond giving ample proof of the incipience of the\r\nbaleful distemper, or else she was making herself a glaring example of\r\nthat frailty which is imputed to woman. Standing between the horns of\r\na dilemma which he had evolved from his independent consideration of\r\nthe question, he was satisfied that he had rather accept the former\r\nposition, painful as it must be to him, than force himself to believe\r\nRomaine guilty of an inconstancy as reprehensible as it was\r\nunjustifiable. Setting aside his strong fraternal regard for Morton,\r\nHubert esteemed Drummond one of God's noblemen, as out of doubt he\r\nwas. Had Morton been the favored one primarily, Hubert would have been\r\ncontent; but such was his sense of justice he could not passively\r\nstand by and see Morton, deeply as he loved and respected him, usurp\r\nthe rights and place of one whom he had no reason to regard with a\r\nlighter love and respect.\r\n\r\nSuch being the case, he felt himself called upon to probe the mystery\r\nand right the wrong, if wrong there were, while his mother remained in\r\noptimistic apathy. He kept his counsel and patiently awaited his\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\nOne perfect spring morning, perhaps a week removed from that dark and\r\nperplexing day that had befallen Belvoir, Hubert met Romaine as she\r\nemerged from the house accompanied by a splendid mastiff in leash,\r\nevidently prepared for a tour of the gardens and the surrounding park.\r\nLoyd Morton had gone into the city for the purpose of making further\r\narrangements with his friend Chalmers to attend to his practice\r\nindefinitely. For reasons best known to himself, he considered his\r\npresence indispensable at Belvoir, and no incentive had been offered\r\nhim to think otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe present was the first occasion upon which brother and sister had\r\nmet, since Romaine's illness, free of the surveillance of Morton. It\r\nwas surely an opportunity not to be neglected.\r\n\r\n\"You are going for a walk?\" inquired Hubert, engagingly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, for our first walk, as in the good old times! Eh, Molossus?\"\r\nRomaine replied, with a gay smile that embodied much of the vernal\r\nbuoyancy of the morning, stooping as she spoke to stroke the tawny\r\nvelvet of the dog's head.\r\n\r\n\"May I bear you company?\"\r\n\r\nShe hesitated an instant, with that fascinating archness which was\r\nhers to employ with telling effect.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" she remarked, \"I have no objection to your company if Molossus\r\nhas not; but you see we have so long been deprived of each other's\r\ncompanionship that--well, we are just a trifle averse to intruders.\r\nYou see it seems an age since we were free and alone together.\"\r\n\r\nAs if to second her words the great animal pressed closely into the\r\nfolds of her gown, looking up into her face the while with eloquent\r\naffection.\r\n\r\n\"The old traitor!\" laughed Hubert; \"what would he have done but for\r\nmy devotion while you were ill? For the time being he transferred all\r\nhis love to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, but, my dear boy, I always told you that Molossus is simply\r\nhuman; he feels like all of us, that first love is always the best; we\r\nreturn to it as if by instinct.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do we?\" inquired Hubert sharply, scarcely able to conceal the\r\nthoughts that were uppermost in his mind; \"do _you_ find it to be\r\ntrue?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should I not?\" she answered, with the most innocent of smiles;\r\nthen, bending to the dog, she added, \"Come, Molossus, we will permit\r\nthis young unbeliever to trespass upon our privacy, just this once, if\r\nonly to convince him how enduring a first love is.\"\r\n\r\nSo, side by side, the three companions passed down the steps and\r\nstrolled away through the broad garden-paths, whence the crocuses and\r\nsnow-drops had retired to give place to hyacinths and tulips, standing\r\nin serried lines, like small armies gorgeous in fresh uniforms. There\r\nwas a general bourgeoning of rose-trees in the sun, while the perfume\r\nof shy violets was borne far and wide upon the pregnant air. It was a\r\nday of days, a halcyon day, instinct with proud summer's boast, when\r\nbirds have cause to sing.\r\n\r\nThey walked along in congenial silence, the mastiff sniffing at the\r\ntrim box-edging of the path, or ever and anon making abortive lunges\r\nat some new-fledged butterfly that, disturbed at their approach,\r\nwinged its devious flight sunward.\r\n\r\nPresently, after much cautious preparation, Hubert broke the charmed\r\nsilence by remarking, \"I have been at Drummond Lodge several times\r\nsince you were ill, Romaine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\" she replied, half unconsciously, \"you found them well there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Drummond is as well as any hopeless invalid can be. Colley has\r\ngone away.\"\r\n\r\nHe set his eyes keenly upon her face as he spoke. Romaine was looking\r\nstraight before her calmly, fancy-free.\r\n\r\n\"Gone away?\" she echoed; \"where?\"\r\n\r\n\"No one at the Lodge seems to know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not even his mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\nShe started forward suddenly, stooping to pick a tiny sprig of\r\nforget-me-not that gemmed the border.\r\n\r\n\"The very first of the season!\" she exclaimed in childish delight;\r\n\"you dear little blossoms! how dared you venture here before there is\r\neven a rose-bud to bear you company? Here, Hubert,\" she cried, \"you\r\nshall wear them!\"\r\n\r\nShe was about to attach the spray to the lapel of his coat, when she\r\nsurprised a look of keen disappointment, almost of chagrin upon his\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\"You do not like them!\" she murmured, turning sad in a moment, as an\r\nApril day is obscured.\r\n\r\nHe took her hands in his gently, but there was a note of firmness in\r\nhis voice, as he said,\r\n\r\n\"It is not to the flowers that I object, but to the way in which you\r\nslight their meaning.\"\r\n\r\n\"What can you mean?\" she asked in a puzzled, nearly pained way.\r\n\r\n\"You are forgetful, Romaine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of your duty.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned pale and started back so suddenly that the mastiff,\r\nstartled likewise, uttered a deep-mouthed growl.\r\n\r\n\"Of what do you accuse me?\" she cried piteously. \"O Hubert, my\r\nbrother! what have I done?\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you leaving undone?\" he persisted rashly. \"Ask your heart,\r\nand let it answer me--your best friend--answer me honestly.\"\r\n\r\nShe made a movement as though she were groping in the darkness, which\r\nyoung Effingham was too eager and excited to notice.\r\n\r\n\"I--I do not understand,\" she faltered.\r\n\r\n\"What month is this, Romaine? Is it not the month of May?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what event, what happy event, was to have happened in this\r\nmonth, _shall_ happen if God wills?\"\r\n\r\n\"My marriage,\" she sighed.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" he cried earnestly; \"your marriage, dear--your marriage\r\nwith whom?\"\r\n\r\nShe twisted the blue-starred sprig between her white fingers until it\r\nwilted.\r\n\r\n\"You say you are my best friend, Hubert?\" she murmured.\r\n\r\n\"You should know it, dear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I will confide in you. If--if my marriage is to take place this\r\nmonth--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, this month! Whom are you to marry?\"\r\n\r\n\"Loyd.\"\r\n\r\nThe name escaped her blanched lips almost inaudibly; but his eager ear\r\ncaught it, and he recoiled from her with a gasp, as though she had\r\nstung him.\r\n\r\nShe wavered for an instant, then flung out her hands blindly, as if\r\ngrasping for support.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, take me into the house!\" she moaned; \"I am ill again.\"\r\n\r\nHe sprang to her side just in time to feel her delicate weight in his\r\narms; but she did not quite lose consciousness, possibly because, in\r\nswift contrition, he whispered,\r\n\r\n\"Of course you shall marry Loyd, darling, if you will.\" While under\r\nhis breath he added, \"God forgive me, never again will I hazard her\r\nprecious life, come what may! But, in Heaven's name, what does it all\r\nmean? I am satisfied that her mind is _not_ deranged!\"\r\n\r\nUpon his return to Belvoir, Doctor Morton was surprised and alarmed to\r\nfind his patient restless from sudden fever. And thereupon he\r\nregistered a solemn oath never again to leave her, it mattered not how\r\nfared his clientage.\r\n\r\nThe excitement caused by Romaine's ill turn fortunately proved a false\r\nalarm. There could be no gainsaying the magic of Morton's presence.\r\nThe moment she saw him, every trace of the mysterious agitation left\r\nher, the feverish symptoms vanished as suddenly as they had appeared,\r\nand, after a few gentle words of welcome, which induced his promise\r\nthat he would remain within call, she lapsed into profound, healthful\r\nslumber, from which she awoke sufficiently refreshed to appear at\r\ndinner in her usual gay spirits.\r\n\r\nPoor Hubert found himself more hopelessly mystified than ever\r\nregarding his sister's incomprehensible condition. If he could have\r\nhad speech with Colston Drummond, even for the briefest space, there\r\ncan be no doubt that the discarded lover's view of the situation would\r\nhave gone a long way towards clearing Hubert's vision. Though much too\r\nintelligent a man of the world to sympathize in the slightest degree\r\nwith the fanciful \"isms\" of his day, Drummond was constrained to\r\naccredit Morton with some sort of magnetic influence which had served\r\nto effect the subversion of Romaine's reason, so far as he personally\r\nwas concerned. His view of her case was correct, his diagnosis\r\naccurate so far as it went. Upon the recovery of his manliness and\r\npower of cool reasoning, he was inclined to scout the fancy that any\r\nserious consequences would result from Romaine's infatuation. He\r\nargued that such caprices must be transitory, and persuaded himself,\r\nthat, without his interference, affairs must right themselves, and\r\nultimately right themselves in his favor.\r\n\r\nHowever, he smarted under the lash of Mrs. Effingham's dismissal; her\r\naction wounded him far more than did the compulsory return of his\r\nbetrothal-ring. He acutely judged that Romaine, being under the\r\nsupremacy of Morton, was not responsible for what she might do,\r\nwhereas it must be otherwise with her mother. He felt convinced that\r\nwere he to go to Mrs. Effingham and masterfully demand an explanation\r\nof her attitude towards him, he could easily win her back to his side.\r\nBut she had dismissed him from her house--the fact burned and rankled\r\ninwardly. He was touched in his most vulnerable point--his high-strung\r\npride; and consequently he found himself unable to confront the\r\npassive days of exile within sight of Belvoir. It was a foolish,\r\nill-advised step, his going away just at this important juncture; and\r\nhe came to a realizing sense of his mistake ere he had placed a\r\nhundred miles between himself and the object of his heart's desire.\r\nPride is short-lived; and, when pride dies, obstinacy ceases to seem a\r\nvirtue. The truth came home to Drummond ere he had gone far from home,\r\nand with results which we shall presently see.\r\n\r\nHubert Effingham never favored Morton with Romaine's confidences of\r\nthat unlucky moment in the garden. Much as he cared for Morton, he\r\nwould have bitten his tongue off before he would have betrayed his\r\nsister--before he would have placed one pebble of impediment in the\r\npath of Drummond's cause. But, though he steered a middle course with\r\nstudious fealty--though he struggled hard to be impartial in his\r\nestimate of both men--insensibly his sympathy fluttered away to the\r\nabsent suitor.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile no barrier was raised against the intimate intercourse of\r\nRomaine and her medical adviser. While she was with him, she was in\r\nabundant health and spirits; when separated, she pined; consequently,\r\nhe was permitted to be her constant companion. Unmolested, they walked\r\nand drove together in the lengthening days of crescent summer. Upon\r\nsuch blissful occasions he invariably addressed her by the name of\r\nPaula, and she readily, happily answered to the name. Though he\r\nstudied her with lynx-like intensity, he never discovered the\r\nslightest tremor of surprise that he should not address her as others\r\ndid. So far he was satisfied, and in so far he fancied himself to be\r\njustified in laying the flattering unction to his soul that he was\r\nindeed in communion with the reincarnated spirit of his wife. The\r\npoint which baffled him, before the non-committal front of which he\r\nshrank chilled and discouraged, was the total oblivion of all past\r\nevents which that spirit evinced.\r\n\r\nYet he was not wholly discouraged, since he never permitted his cult\r\nof the veiled idol to overshadow his system of persistent\r\ninvestigation. For the hundredth time, he would endeavor to recall to\r\nher mind some sweet episode of his by-gone courtship, or briefly happy\r\nwedded life, and for the hundredth time she would reply, with that\r\ngentle smile,\r\n\r\n\"How I wish I could remember a time that must have been so joyous! Ah,\r\nmy dear Loyd, I fear this poor head of mine is like the Chaldean\r\nidols--more clay than gold!\"\r\n\r\nCertainly her defective recollection of the leading events in the life\r\nof Romaine Effingham, previous to her acute illness, lent color to the\r\nsupposition that Paula Morton might be equally deficient in this\r\nregard, in that both personalities were forced to act through the\r\nsame disabled brain; that is, granting the doubt as to which spirit\r\nmight be in residence at the time.\r\n\r\nNaturally, the reasoning was not logical--not conclusive to a man of\r\nMorton's intelligence; and yet with it he was fain to be content.\r\n\r\nOf one thing he was satisfied; Paula, reincarnated, could not have\r\nloved him more fondly than the beautiful being who had voluntarily\r\nabandoned every tie to bind herself to him. Sometimes he wondered,\r\nwith the chill of death at his heart, how it was all to end; and she,\r\nseeming to divine the desperate query, as often as it presented\r\nitself, when he was with her, would exclaim,\r\n\r\n\"What matters it whether I recall the past or not, so long as we are\r\nhappy in the present, so long as you have my love for the future and\r\nfor all eternity?\"\r\n\r\nPaula might have said that in just such words; and the glamor of his\r\nfool's paradise encompassed him again. Thus the inexplicable\r\nsituation, in the natural course of events, grew to a climax.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon they had been riding for miles through the park-like\r\nwoodland of the neighborhood, their horses keeping leisurely pace\r\nthrough aisles white with the bloom of dogwood. For a while Morton had\r\nentertained his companion with reminiscences of that happy by-gone\r\ntime which was a reality to him, a pleasing effort of the imagination\r\nto her. Her responsiveness was an encouragement to him; and he began\r\nat the beginning, closing with the untimely end.\r\n\r\nThere were tears--tears of genuine sympathy and sorrow--in her limpid\r\neyes as he ceased speaking. So graphic had been his description of\r\nthat last scene in the cemetery--that end-all to his hope and\r\njoy--that she seemed to see the lonely figure beside the open grave,\r\nto hear his sobs mingling with the sough of the rainy wind, and to\r\nfeel the unutterable desolation of that grievous hour.\r\n\r\n\"Loyd,\" she said, after a brief pause, her tone suggestive of unshed\r\ntears, \"you must take me to her grave some day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whose grave?\" he demanded sharply, her sympathy for the first time\r\nstriking a discordant note in his soul.\r\n\r\n\"Her grave,\" she answered, wonderingly, \"your wife's.\"\r\n\r\nHe slid from his saddle, allowing his horse to turn to the lush grass,\r\nand came to her side. He took her hand in both of his and looked up\r\ninto her face with an intensity that startled her.\r\n\r\n\"That grave was _your_ grave, Paula,\" he said. \"Can you not\r\nunderstand?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is hard to realize,\" she faltered.\r\n\r\n\"And you are _my wife_!\"\r\n\r\nShe turned pale so suddenly that he would have been alarmed, had not\r\nthe fugitive dye instantly returned deeper than before upon cheek and\r\nbrow.\r\n\r\n\"Your wife!\"\r\n\r\n\"My wife in the sight of God! Oh, have no doubt of it; for your\r\nindecision would drive me mad! Paula was my wife, and you are Paula!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but Paula in another form.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly! But still my wife!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not in the sight of man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then the sooner we are made one again, the better!\" he went on\r\nimpetuously. \"See, you wear your own betrothal-ring. Can you, will you\r\nsubmit to the absurdity of a second marriage ceremony, for the sake of\r\nthe blind world's opinion?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can and will,\" she answered.\r\n\r\n\"Then let there be no delay!\"\r\n\r\nHe reached up, and, bending low, she kissed him upon the lips; and she\r\ndid it so frankly, trustingly, that henceforth he banished every\r\ndoubt, every vestige of uncertainty to that vague realm whither much\r\nof his outraged common-sense had fled.\r\n\r\nLate that night a wailing cry startled the quiet of the house--a cry\r\nlow, but sufficient in carrying-power to rouse Mrs. Effingham from the\r\ndepths of her first sleep. Hurrying, breathless with apprehension,\r\nthrough the dressing-room which separated her chamber from Romaine's,\r\nspeechless was her amazement and alarm to find the girl standing\r\nbefore her mirror, the candelabra ablaze on either side, robed from\r\nhead to foot in white, the splendid masses of her hair sweeping about\r\nher shoulders. Upon her exquisite neck and arms scintillated rivulets\r\nof diamonds, heir-looms of the Effingham family, which descended to\r\neach daughter of the house upon her eighteenth birthday; while in her\r\nhand, held at arm's length, glittered an object which had the sheen of\r\nblent gold and jewels--a tiny object that fitted softly into the snowy\r\npalm. Upon this object were her eyes riveted, with a sort of wild\r\ndismay in their inspection. She seemed entranced, and for a minute the\r\nwatcher dared give no sign of her intrusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n    \"Wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age,\r\n    And rob me of a happy mother's name?\"\r\n\r\nThe events which led up to the somewhat dramatic climax in Romaine's\r\nchamber at midnight would scarcely seem to warrant so pronounced a\r\ncrisis. An agreeable evening had been passed in the music-room, Morton\r\nand Hubert smoking, Mrs. Effingham busied with some bit of fancy-work,\r\nwhile Romaine played the piano or sang, as her mood suggested. She was\r\nan ardent musician, possessed of a fine mezzo-soprano voice, which had\r\nbeen trained in the best schools. Her fancy was for the fantasticism\r\nof the more modern composers; and upon this occasion, being in the\r\nvein, she sang, with remarkable effect, the weird night-song of the\r\nslave in Goldmark's \"Queen of Sheba,\" the dreamy Berceuse from \"Lakme\"\r\nand two or three of Meyer Helmund's idyllic creations. The vibrant\r\ntenderness and surpassing melody of her voice filled her hearers with\r\nwonder. Never had she sung with such depth of feeling; and they\r\nmarvelled at it, regarding the performance as a revelation. Naturally,\r\nas the evening wore on, a reaction set in, a pallid exhaustion took\r\nthe place of the heightened color of cheek and lip, and finally\r\nRomaine rose from the piano unnerved and hysterical. The party\r\npromptly broke up, and Mrs. Effingham led the way to her daughter's\r\nchamber.\r\n\r\nBy eleven o'clock the good lady had left Romaine, apparently calm and\r\nat peace with herself, in the hands of her maid, and had retired for\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\nThe gown of India silk had been exchanged for a garment of soft white\r\nwool, the peculiar flowing pattern of which suggested the graceful\r\nrobes of Watteau and Greuze, and in it the young mistress of Belvoir\r\nreclined at ease upon her couch. So lost was she in revery, that she\r\ntook no heed of the maid, who, her preparations for the night\r\ncompleted, glided to the back of the couch and stood waiting. The\r\nDresden clock's faint tick became audible, and presently the chime\r\nrang out. The oppressive silence broken, the maid spoke:\r\n\r\n\"Will Miss Romaine have her hair brushed now?\"\r\n\r\nRomaine turned with a start, casting one exquisitely moulded arm up to\r\nthe back of the couch, so that she faced the speaker.\r\n\r\n\"I must have been asleep or in a trance!\" she exclaimed in a dazed\r\nway. \"No, no, Eunice; I will braid my hair to-night. Go to bed. It is\r\nlate. See, it is half-past eleven.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, miss, I--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know you would work over me until you dropped from sheer\r\nfatigue,\" the young lady went on, with a smile; \"but I shall not\r\npermit it--not to-night. I prefer to be left alone. Good-night.\"\r\n\r\nReluctantly the maid vanished, closing the door behind her.\r\n\r\nThe instant she disappeared, Romaine rose and stood in the faint glow\r\nof the single candle, her white robe lying in ample folds about her.\r\n\r\n\"At last I am alone!\" She listened intently for some sound in the\r\nsilent house. \"Alone--with my thoughts of _him_! How he loves me;\r\nbut,\" with a fluttering sigh, \"how he loved that _other one_--that\r\nPaula! Am I she? He says I am; and who should know as well as he? Oh,\r\nit is all so strange, so mysterious, that--that I cannot tell. His\r\ngreat love assures me that I must have lived before. When I am with\r\nhim, I am as sure as he; but, when he is not with me, I seem to doubt,\r\nto be groping somewhere, as it were blindfold, among familiar scenes.\r\nO Loyd, sustain me, be my guide, or I shall fall by the wayside,\r\nfainting, helpless!\"\r\n\r\nShe crossed her chamber and stood before her mirror, gazing intently\r\nat her reflection. Presently she withdrew the golden pin from her hair\r\nand let its rich masses fall about her shoulders like a bronze-gold\r\nveil.\r\n\r\n\"His wife!\" she murmured, smiling wanly at her image; \"his wife\r\n_again_ after some lapse of time! How long a time? Ah, does he detect\r\nsome change in me which he is too loyal to notice? With time, come\r\nchange and decay. How can I tell how changed I may be--in _his_\r\nsight?\" She shuddered, and peered more keenly at the mirror. \"If I\r\n_am_ changed,\" she concluded, with a pretty assumption of desperate\r\nresolution, \"it is my duty to repair the ravages of time. I will be\r\ndressed like any queen at her bridal. I will wear all my jewels, and\r\nlet their lustre conceal defects from even his generous eyes. He loves\r\nme; but I must struggle to _hold_ that love. My jewels! Where are my\r\njewels? How shall I look in them?\"\r\n\r\nWith feverish haste she opened the compartments of the toilet-table\r\nuntil her eager hands fell upon a casket of dull red leather, faded\r\nand bruised. Within, however, the velvet cushions were as fresh and\r\nwhite as though newly lined; there was no more hint that four\r\ngenerations had gazed upon their sheeny lustre than there was hint of\r\nage in the priceless gems that nestled, glittering like captured\r\nstars, amid their depths.\r\n\r\nRomaine uttered a sigh of delight, and, with eager, trembling hands,\r\nhung the chained brilliants upon her neck and arms. Then she lighted\r\nthe candelabra beside the mirror, and stood back, speechless before\r\nher own surpassing beauty.\r\n\r\n\"Would he could see me _now_!\" she exclaimed naïvely, entranced, then\r\nbent forward to insert still other jewels in her ears.\r\n\r\nAt that moment an object set in gold and rimmed with diamonds caught\r\nher eye. She had not noticed it before, but now it riveted the\r\ninspection of her very soul.\r\n\r\nShe snatched it from the case with a low, wailing cry, akin to the\r\nsmothered utterance of one laboring in nightmare, and held it at arm's\r\nlength, breathless, speechless.\r\n\r\nSimply a medallion set in gems, the medallion of a man's face--_the\r\nface of Colston Drummond_!\r\n\r\nAnd it was at this moment, supreme enough to thrill poor Romaine's\r\nreviving intellect, that Mrs. Effingham hastily entered the chamber.\r\n\r\nThe lateness of the hour, coupled with her daughter's incongruous\r\ntoilet, startled the good lady into the passing fancy that some\r\nunexpected crisis had arrived--that Romaine had indeed taken leave of\r\nher senses. She uttered some stifled exclamation and stood\r\nspell-bound. As quick as thought the girl dropped the miniature into\r\nits case and turned to confront the intruder.\r\n\r\n\"Mother!\" she exclaimed, her voice trembling with repressed emotion,\r\n\"thank heaven, you have come! Otherwise I should have been forced to\r\nwake you, for I cannot sleep, I cannot wait another hour, another\r\nminute. I _must_ speak now, this instant!\"\r\n\r\nShe came to her mother and laid her jewelled arms about her neck, her\r\nvery attitude eloquent of the yearning of her soul.\r\n\r\nIt was with the utmost effort that Mrs. Effingham commanded herself\r\nsufficiently to conceal the dire apprehension that assailed her.\r\n\r\n\"And so you shall speak, my darling,\" she answered soothingly, as one\r\nwould humor a perverted fancy; \"unburden your whole heart to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mother, I was to have been married this month.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my dear child.\"\r\n\r\n\"How many days are we from the date proposed?\"\r\n\r\nThe anxious pallor of the lady's face overspread her lips and she\r\nhesitated.\r\n\r\n\"What does it matter, dear?\" she faltered.\r\n\r\n\"What does it matter!\" echoed Romaine steadily; \"it matters much--to\r\nme. Events have become confused in my mind since my illness; so you\r\nmust tell me how soon I was to have been married. You _must_ tell me,\r\nfor I wish to know.\"\r\n\r\n\"The twentieth of May was the day appointed,\" was the reluctant reply.\r\n\r\n\"And it is now?\"\r\n\r\n\"The fifth.\"\r\n\r\n\"More than a fortnight to wait! And delays are dangerous. Mother, I\r\nhave seen my wedding-dress in the east room. Is everything prepared?\"\r\n\r\n\"Everything, Romaine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why delay, and so court danger? Let my marriage take place at\r\nonce, the sooner the better.\"\r\n\r\n\"Romaine!\"\r\n\r\n\"Loyd has spoken to-day; he would second my petition were he here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Loyd!\"\r\n\r\nShe recoiled out of the girl's embrace as she spoke, and stood staring\r\nat her in blank amazement.\r\n\r\n\"Loyd!\" she added faintly; \"it is _Loyd_ you wish to marry?\"\r\n\r\n\"Whom else?\" answered Romaine, smiling calmly; \"you would not doubt\r\nit, mother dear, if you knew _all_. Oh, I am not demented, as perhaps\r\nyou think. I am myself again, thanks to the magnetism of his great\r\nlove. Mother, if I thought that he were never to have the right in the\r\nsight of God and man to call me wife, I should pray for death--ay,\r\ncourt it as the sweetest boon. Thwart me in my love, and you kill me;\r\ngrant my prayer, and you not only give me life, but heaven upon\r\nearth!\"\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said that Mrs. Effingham was wholly unprepared for the\r\nturn affairs had taken. Setting aside Hubert's expressed suspicions,\r\nher woman's instinct had vaguely warned her how this inexplicable\r\ncourse of love had raised Morton upon its bosom, leaving Drummond high\r\nand dry, stranded upon the stale and unprofitable shore of Neglect.\r\nAnd yet, out of sheer loyalty to Drummond and his interests, she had\r\nrefused to listen to that mysterious voice, stiller and smaller than\r\nthe voice of conscience. She had waited to be convinced by some\r\nulterior medium which, after all, she knew could but accord with her\r\nown unacknowledged convictions.\r\n\r\nFrom her son next day she received but cold comfort, though it was\r\ngently offered, according to his wont.\r\n\r\n\"I told you so,\" he remarked. \"For Colley's sake, I have done what I\r\ncould, only to be met by dismal failure. I will never venture to risk\r\nso much again. We must accept the inevitable, dear mother, and make\r\nthe best of a situation which, if inexplicable, is far from desperate.\r\nI can only say, God grant that Romaine's determined action may not\r\nprove to be some insane caprice!\"\r\n\r\n\"Amen to that!\" came the faltering reply.\r\n\r\nThe lady's first interview with Morton after the revelation was\r\nmanaged in more diplomatic fashion.\r\n\r\nShe met the young physician in the garden before breakfast on the\r\nfollowing morning. She kissed him in silence, and held his hands while\r\nthe unbidden tears welled within her haggard eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Romaine has spoken!\" he exclaimed, interpreting the mute eloquence of\r\nher attitude.\r\n\r\nShe bowed her head in assent.\r\n\r\n\"And you--you have given your consent?\" he asked tremulously.\r\n\r\n\"Did you not warn me that it might be fatal to thwart Romaine in any\r\nway?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is not answering my question,\" he said with sudden sternness;\r\n\"do you give your consent to our marriage?\"\r\n\r\n\"Romaine's peace of mind is paramount to all other considerations,\"\r\nshe answered; \"her will is my law.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you are reluctant to give her to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know no reluctance where her wishes are concerned. I have closed my\r\neyes to every other consideration save her happiness, Loyd; and with\r\nall my heart I give her to you--for her sake.\"\r\n\r\nAnd with, such modicum of consolation he was obliged to be content.\r\n\r\nConsidering the eminent social position of the persons concerned, it\r\nis small wonder that the report of Romaine's change of heart swept\r\nsociety like a whirlwind. The indignation that was expressed on the\r\nscore of the young lady's so-called frailty was not occasioned by the\r\nfact that the fashionable world loved Morton less, but that it loved\r\nDrummond more. Had the latter gentleman stood by his guns, he would\r\nhave been the hero of the hour and received a greater meed of sympathy\r\nthan is usually vouchsafed the banished lover; but, as he had played\r\nthe renegade when he should have formally opposed his rival, society\r\nshrugged its shoulders, and saw to it that Morton's prowess did not\r\nwant praise and esteem. Thus ever does the myopic world deceive\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nIt was decided that the ceremony should be accomplished upon the\r\ntwelfth day of the month, that it should be conducted with the\r\nstrictest privacy, and that no invitations should be issued. Of course\r\nthere would be \"after-cards,\" and in due course there would be\r\nreceptions upon the return of the pair from a sojourn in Europe. Such\r\nwere the hasty arrangements, to which all concerned agreed.\r\n\r\nThe change from doubt to certainty operated most favorably upon\r\nMorton--the galling irritability of the past few weeks vanished; the\r\nnatural buoyancy of his early youth returned; he seemed to find a zest\r\nin living, which was a surprise and delight to no one more than to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nRomaine, on the other hand, though to all appearance happy and\r\ncontent, endured nameless torture when left to herself--her nights\r\nwere hideous epochs of harassing suspense and misgiving; the\r\nunattended hours of her days were rendered unbearable by some\r\ninvisible incubus which, she was neither able to explain nor banish.\r\nEver and anon she would seem to herself to be upon the verge of some\r\nexplanation, some solution of the enigma with which she wasted herself\r\nin unavailing battle; but no sooner did she find herself approaching\r\nthis most desirable consummation, than she fell into the toils of\r\nMorton's irresistible influence, and was content to find herself the\r\nvictim of his soothing wiles. In a word, her meditations upon the\r\nsubject simply resolved themselves into this formula: When I am with\r\nhim, I love him beyond question; when I am _not_ with him, my love is\r\ncrossed by doubt.\r\n\r\nAs if by instinct Morton divined the threatening condition of her\r\nmind, and consequently left no stone unturned to hasten the\r\npreparations for his marriage. Circumstances forced him, in great\r\nmeasure, to relax his sedulous care and espionage. To all appearance\r\nhe found his patient as hale, mentally and physically, as she had ever\r\nbeen; and, though he was by no means free of apprehension on her\r\naccount, he did not scruple to absent himself as often as he found it\r\nnecessary for him to make some adjustment of his affairs in view of an\r\nindefinite sojourn abroad. Then, too, he experienced the liveliest\r\nsatisfaction in setting his somewhat neglected house in town in order,\r\nand in beautifying its every detail for the reception of his bride.\r\nThe wilful, methodical nature of the man manifested itself in just\r\nsuch _minutiæ_ as the hanging of a drapery here, or the placing of an\r\nornament there, that he might satisfy himself as to the exact\r\nappearance of the place when she should come home to it--it mattered\r\nnot when. He trusted no one; he placed no confidence in judgment other\r\nthan his own. It was a labor of love; and, like a labor of love, it\r\nhad long since become a work of faith, as was meet--especially under\r\nthe circumstances.\r\n\r\nSeveral hours of each day Morton passed in the city, and perhaps\r\nnothing afforded such ample proof of his confidence in the\r\nestablishment of affairs as the composure and assurance with which he\r\nreturned each time to Belvoir. The truth was, he had made assurance\r\ndouble sure, and taken a bond of Fate--or so he was constrained to\r\nregard his successful course.\r\n\r\nIt was during one of these occasions of non-attendance, a day or two\r\nafter the rumor of the engagement had spread its facile wing, that an\r\nimposing family-carriage, decorated as to its panels with the ensign\r\narmorial of the Drummonds, turned in at the gates of Belvoir, and\r\nentered upon the gradual ascent of the avenue with the cumbrous roll\r\nof stately equipages in general, and of the Drummond equipage in\r\nparticular. Upon the hammer-cloth were seated an ancient coachman and\r\nfootman, most punctilious of mien and attire; while within the coach,\r\nbolstered into an upright position among the cushions, sat a lady well\r\ninto the decline of life and health, a spare, stern creature, with the\r\nface of an aged queen. It was a face from which the effulgence of\r\nhalcyon days had died out, but despite the rigidity of its lines it\r\nwas still a countenance replete with an inborn dignity. Letitia\r\nDrummond had been a beauty in her day, and it was some consolation to\r\nher in her decline, to find something of her famed advantages revived\r\nin her only and beloved son.\r\n\r\nThis son was her idol, in her eyes a very paragon; her worship of him\r\nwas the one vital interest of her invalid existence. Secluded from the\r\nworld by reason of her malady, she drew vitality from her communion\r\nwith him as the frail, unearthly orchid subsists upon the air which\r\nits hale neighbors reject.\r\n\r\nIt had been years since the widow Drummond had entered her carriage,\r\nand she had by no means dared exposure to the dampness of this May\r\nmorning for a trifle. As the horses leisurely took their way along the\r\navenue the lady glanced forth upon the luxurious verdure of lawn and\r\nbudding trees, with a critical scrutiny not unmixed with malevolence.\r\n\r\nPresently the glimpse of a girlish figure gathering lilacs in a\r\nby-path, riveted her attention. Quickly she touched a bell, and in the\r\nnext instant the coach had stopped and the footman was at the open\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\"I see Miss Effingham,\" she remarked; \"give me my cane and help me\r\nout. There! Now drive on a short distance, remain there ten minutes,\r\nthen return for me here. You understand.\"\r\n\r\nThe command was given in a grudging tone, as if each word, each breath\r\nof the balmy air cost her a pang.\r\n\r\nFrom her lilac-bower Romaine had watched the proceeding in wonder; but\r\nas the carriage departed, leaving the withered figure, wrapped in its\r\nfinery of a by-gone date, standing alone in the sunshine, she came\r\nforward, her hands filled with snowy blossoms.\r\n\r\nThey met beside a rustic garden-seat, beneath hawthorns full of rosy\r\nbloom and the carolling of birds.\r\n\r\nAs Romaine paused, irresolute, the lady spoke:\r\n\r\n\"You recognize me?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are Mrs. Drummond.\"\r\n\r\n\"I _am_ Mrs. Drummond, Colston's mother.\"\r\n\r\nShe had drawn her weapon, and seemed figuratively to be examining the\r\nkeenness of point and edge.\r\n\r\nRomaine shuddered.\r\n\r\n\"Where is he?\" demanded the lady.\r\n\r\n\"Where is--who?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who!--who but my son? Whose absence in all this wide world should I\r\ngive an instant's thought to but my son's? For whom else should I dare\r\nmisery and perhaps death to inquire for but my son! Answer me! where\r\nis he?\"\r\n\r\nPoor Romaine had grown as pallid as the flowers that trembled and\r\ndropped one by one from her nerveless hands.\r\n\r\n\"Answer me!\" repeated Mrs. Drummond; \"I am his mother, and I will not\r\nbe satisfied with any white-lipped silence. What have you done with my\r\nson? Where is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I do not know.\"\r\n\r\nMost hearts would have been touched by the pitiful innocence of those\r\nwords and look.\r\n\r\n\"You do not know. I will believe you so far; but why has he left his\r\nhome--and me?\"\r\n\r\n\"How can I tell?\" faltered the girl.\r\n\r\n\"I can imagine you experience some difficulty,\" was the harsh reply,\r\n\"but I mean to remove all obstacles from your path so that you _can_\r\ntell, and also give me a coherent account. He had entrusted his\r\nhappiness to your keeping; he had divided his love for me with you.\r\nWhat account have you to give of your stewardship?\"\r\n\r\nThe helpless attitude of the girl coupled with her wild-eyed silence,\r\nseemed to infuriate the lady.\r\n\r\n\"No wonder you do not dare to raise your voice to answer me,\" she\r\ncried shrilly; \"faithless, false-hearted girl! You have wrecked his\r\nlife! And when the news of your ill-assorted marriage reaches him, it\r\nwill kill him, and I shall not survive his death! Jezebel!\" she\r\nhissed, griping Romaine's arm in her gloved claw, \"do you comprehend\r\nthat two lives, two God-given lives will be upon your soul when you\r\nhave consummated this unholy deed? I would die for my son. I would\r\neven be branded with crime for the sake of his peace and happiness! I\r\n_love_ him! And what has your vaunted love amounted to? Answer me, or\r\nI will smite that mutely-mocking mouth of yours! Have you not told him\r\na thousand times, have you not assured him by word, by deed, by action\r\nthat you loved him? Answer me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" came the gasping reply.\r\n\r\n\"Then why have you played him false?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I do not know, I--I cannot tell!\"\r\n\r\nShe cast the delicate arm from her as though the contact were\r\ncontamination.\r\n\r\n\"I hope to heaven you _are_ insane, as it is whispered,\" she gasped,\r\nweak from excess of anger and feebleness; \"madness would be your only\r\nsalvation in _my_ eyes. But I have my doubts, I have my doubts. I\r\nshall raise heaven and earth to find my son, I shall go in search of\r\nhim myself if messengers fail, and when he is found I shall send him\r\nto you, and I only pray that the sight of him may strike you dead at\r\nhis feet if he comes too late!\"\r\n\r\nThe grinding of the returning carriage-wheels upon the gravel of the\r\navenue interrupted her further utterance, and in silence she hobbled\r\nback to the footman, who obsequiously replaced her upon her cushions.\r\n\r\nLeft alone amidst the whispering leaves, the sunshine and the birds,\r\nRomaine slowly struggled back to semi-consciousness. She pressed her\r\nhands upon her throbbing temples, while dry sobs rent her from head to\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\n\"O what have I done?\" she sobbed, \"and what am I doing?\"\r\n\r\nLike one stricken with sudden blindness she felt her way from tree to\r\ntree, leaning against their trunks every now and then for support. In\r\nthis pitiful way she reached the terrace-steps, stumbled and fell\r\nprostrate in the garish light, like a stricken flower discarded by the\r\nreapers.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n                      \"The Devil tempts thee here\r\n    In likeness of a new untrimmed bride.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Such a mad marriage never was before.\"\r\n\r\nIf Serena Effingham derived any comfort from the contemplation of\r\nRomaine's precipitate union with Morton, that comfort resided in the\r\nfact that having secured the constant attendance and companionship of\r\nthe young physician, the girl would enjoy immunity from the mysterious\r\ncrises that were likely to assail her whenever he was not at hand.\r\nThere was no gainsaying the point that Romaine was perfectly herself\r\nwhile under Morton's influence. No one could deny the potency of the\r\nspell he exerted; consequently Mrs. Effingham was forced to accept the\r\nlesser of the evils, if so strong a term may be applied to her gentle\r\nestimate of the situation.\r\n\r\nIt was the good lady herself who discovered her daughter lying\r\ninsensible at the foot of the terrace steps; and as Romaine, upon the\r\nrecovery of her consciousness, guarded the secret of her stormy\r\ninterview with Mrs. Drummond even from her mother, who was in\r\nignorance of the unwonted visit, Mrs. Effingham remained in an agony\r\nof suspense and anxiety until Morton returned from town. At sight of\r\nhim the girl flung herself into his arms and clung to him\r\nhysterically, to the perplexity of all concerned.\r\n\r\nWhen questioned regarding the cause of her illness, she returned\r\nanswers of adroit incoherency, simply maintaining that her existence\r\nwas a burden to her when separated from Morton; that she was wholly\r\nwretched and unable to command herself when left to herself. Naturally\r\nsuch extraordinary assertions lent color to the suspicion that her\r\nmind was affected; yet, when in the presence of her heart's desire,\r\nshe appeared perfectly sane and as soundly reasonable as ever she had\r\nbeen. Her condition seemed a hopeless mystery to all save Morton who\r\nwas persuaded beyond peradventure, that he detected the almost jealous\r\nreliance of his departed wife through the mask of her reincarnation.\r\n\r\nFrom that time forth he no longer absented himself from Belvoir, and\r\nthe expectant hours crowded themselves into days that all too rapidly\r\ntook their departure.\r\n\r\nThe eve of Romaine's wedding-day proved to be one of those rare epochs\r\nof spring that are instinct with the genial presage of summer, one of\r\nthose intense days which May has in her gift, when one involuntarily\r\nseeks the shady side of city streets, or wanders into the shadows of\r\nthe woods to escape the garish splendor of the open fields. Such\r\nweather is always premature and ominous of impending inclemency; but\r\nit is none the less exquisite while it lasts.\r\n\r\nAll day long the lovers had luxuriated in the balmy air, and the\r\nsetting sun surprised them bending their reluctant steps homeward\r\nthrough Drummond copse. One by one the swift hours had registered\r\ntheir happiness, their constantly reiterated oaths of fealty and their\r\nexpressions of confidence in the future. They had uttered nothing\r\nworthy of being chronicled, for they had talked simply as lovers talk,\r\nwith an intent significant only to themselves. They had laid their\r\nplans for the future as the poets fancy the short-sighted birds scheme\r\nat their nest building. Morton had proposed that, the ceremony over,\r\nthey should drive to his town-house and there, amidst its renovated\r\nglories, forget the world until such time as they cared to claim its\r\ndiversions again. There was method in the plan since he entertained\r\nsome vague fancy that his reclaimed wife would be more at her ease,\r\nmore at home among scenes which had witnessed the happiest hours of\r\nher past. And Romaine's joyous acquiescence increased his fancy until\r\nit became positive conviction. He even went so far as to surmise that\r\nthe soul of Paula would evince a keen delight and interest in the new\r\nbeauties of the old abode.\r\n\r\nSo the sun had set and the full moon had reared her colossal lamp to\r\nlight them home. Suddenly, as they emerged from the copse and found\r\nthemselves upon the rustic path that ran between Belvoir and Drummond\r\nLodge, Romaine laid her hand upon her lover's arm with a sharp gasp.\r\n\r\n\"I have left my book up yonder upon the rocks where we sat!\" she\r\nexclaimed; \"oh, Loyd, how careless of me! and _you_ gave it me!\"\r\n\r\nMorton laughed light-heartedly.\r\n\r\n\"We will send one of the men for it in the morning,\" he said; \"there\r\nwill be no pilfering lovers in that place to-night, I warrant you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it will be ruined by the dews,\" she insisted; \"we may forget to\r\nsend for it to-morrow; besides, I do not wish to leave it there. I\r\nwill go back and get it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You!\" he cried, with a laugh; \"if you _must_ have the worthless\r\nthing, I will go for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will go together, Loyd.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he objected, in the gently authoritative tone which had become\r\nhabitual with him, \"you are completely tired out and the climb would\r\nprove the one straw too many. But how can I leave you here?\"\r\n\r\n\"What is there to fear? We are within gun-shot of home.\"\r\n\r\nMorton hesitated an instant; then he said with some reluctance,\r\n\r\n\"Would you mind walking on alone? I will make haste, take a short cut\r\nthrough the copse and meet you upon the lawn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well! I will walk slowly.\"\r\n\r\nFor some reason, which it would be vain to attempt to account for, he\r\nstooped and kissed her where she stood in a mellow ray of the risen\r\nmoon.\r\n\r\n\"Why are you so particular about that little book?\" he asked\r\ntremulously.\r\n\r\n\"I have already told you, dear,\" she answered.\r\n\r\n\"Because _I_ gave it you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; for that reason it is precious, invaluable in my eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"My darling! God bless you for those sweet words! To hear them from\r\nyour dear lips again I would go to the ends of the earth!\"\r\n\r\nIt was simply lovers' parley, but for some reason each felt its vague\r\nsignificance which in some way seemed portentous. He kissed her again,\r\nand left her alone in the woodland path.\r\n\r\nAt one period of her life, that happy time when a trip to Drummond\r\nLodge had been numbered among the chief joys of her innocent life,\r\nRomaine had been familiar with every wild flower that bloomed, with\r\nevery bird that sang in the copse; but since her mysterious illness\r\nall that had passed and the place seemed strange to her. Small wonder\r\nthen that, in the exaltation of parting with Loyd Morton and in the\r\ndubious moon-beams, she turned, not towards Belvoir, but in the\r\ndirection of Drummond Lodge. The night was one of ideal loveliness and\r\nas she leisurely threaded her way between the shadows cast by the\r\ngreat tree-boles, she softly sang to herself and smiled as her quick\r\near caught the twitter of the nesting birds. Suddenly the sharp snap\r\nof a twig punctuated the chant and its invisible chorus, causing the\r\ngirl to pause abruptly and peer before her into the semi-gloom.\r\n\r\nCould it be that love had lent her lover the fleetness of Fortunio's\r\nlackey, so that he had accomplished his quest and returned to surprise\r\nher ere she had reached the verge of the wood? Impossible! And yet the\r\nfigure of a man loomed before her in the narrow, moon-lit path! Her\r\nheart fluttered, then sank like a dead thing in her bosom, while the\r\nwords of glad welcome expired upon her blanched lips.\r\n\r\nFor she had recognized the man, and, by some swift divination of\r\nassociation, knew that he had a right to be where he stood--within his\r\nown domain.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the unexpected encounter was scarcely less patent in the\r\ncase of Colston Drummond. He uttered some inaudible exclamation of\r\nsurprise, halted, then advanced a step, staring at the apparition in\r\nawed silence.\r\n\r\n\"Romaine!\" he murmured at last, as if fearful of breaking the spell\r\nand dissolving the vision by the mere sound of his voice; \"Romaine,\r\ncan it be you--here--at this hour? In heaven's name, where are you\r\ngoing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Home,\" she faltered, her very utterance paralyzed by amazement and\r\nvague fear.\r\n\r\n\"Home!\" he echoed more distinctly, emboldened by the vital voice of\r\nthe phantom; \"you are going in the wrong direction. You are but a few\r\nsteps from the Lodge. My poor girl, why are you here and alone?\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke with the infinite tenderness which was part and parcel of his\r\nmanly nature; and, though he came close to her side, even taking her\r\nhand in his, she did not cringe. Somehow she felt soothed and calmed\r\nby his presence, notwithstanding that she trembled as the environing\r\nleaves trembled in the rising breeze, and did not speak for lack of\r\nself-command.\r\n\r\n\"Do not shiver so,\" he said gently; \"it is neither cold here, nor have\r\nyou any cause for alarm--with me. You have only lost your way. Come, I\r\nwill see you safely home.\"\r\n\r\nThen she roused from her passing stupor.\r\n\r\n\"Oh no, no, no!\" she cried piteously; \"I must go alone. I--he is\r\nwaiting for me. He must not see you--with me. Only show me the way.\"\r\n\r\n\"He!\" Drummond asked calmly; \"you mean Doctor Morton?\"\r\n\r\nShe bowed in silence, while an unfathomable expression flitted across\r\nhis face, to be lost in a pitiful smile.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he said, still holding the hand that she weakly strove to\r\nwrest from him, \"_he_ can wait for a few short minutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, I must go at once,\" she wailed; \"have mercy upon me; let go\r\nmy hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Think, Romaine!\" he commanded softly; \"he will have you for all life,\r\nwhile these few paltry moments with you are all that remain to me.\r\nThink of it, Romaine, and be generous.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked into his face and read the anguished pleading of his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"First of all,\" he continued, \"tell me how you came here? May I\r\nventure to hope that in the eleventh hour you were coming to speak a\r\nword of comfort to my mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I had lost my way.\"\r\n\r\n\"You did not know that I returned to-day?\" he inquired, hope\r\nstruggling against hope in his eager tone.\r\n\r\n\"I had forgotten that you had been away.\"\r\n\r\n\"You had forgotten!\" he cried sadly. \"O Romaine, how you have blotted\r\nme from your very existence! I can conceive of your love for me having\r\nchanged; but why have you so utterly forgotten and neglected me?\"\r\n\r\nShe closed her eyes and replied in sobbing accent, \"I--I cannot tell.\r\nI seem to have been dreaming, to be dreaming still.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would it _were_ all a dream! My darling--there--there, do not start,\r\nit is the last time that I shall ever call you so--darling, I only\r\npray the good God that you are happy.\"\r\n\r\nShe did not answer, and he went on as though he did not notice her\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n\"Only to-day, within the last two hours, have I learned that to-morrow\r\nwill be your wedding-day. Is--is it so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you fancy what that means to me? Oh, heaven is my judge, I do\r\nnot mean to reproach you. It is too late for that. I did not even\r\nthink to see you again; it is some inexplicable fate which has brought\r\nus together. Believe me, I am resigned to my lot; but, since we have\r\nmet, since God in His mercy has vouchsafed me this one ray of comfort,\r\npermit me to beg you, to beseech you ever to regard me as your loyal\r\nfriend. O Romaine, my heart's dearest love, if ever the shadow of\r\nsorrow or trouble arises, command me, even unto my last breath, and I\r\nwill do my utmost to dispel it. I wish you joy, from my soul, I wish\r\nyou joy; I have forgiven, and I shall try to forget. If you doubt me,\r\ntry me; test my fidelity to you even unto death. Now, Romaine, have\r\nyou no word for me? no little grain of comfort to leaven the\r\nbitterness of this last farewell upon earth? Be merciful!\"\r\n\r\nWith the steadiness of summer rain the tears had been coursing over\r\nthe girl's pallid cheeks, and there were tears in her voice as she\r\ncried,\r\n\r\n\"O my God! let me sleep and continue to dream, for, should I awake, I\r\nshould go mad!\"\r\n\r\nHe took her in his arms and pressed her to his breast for one brief\r\nmoment, while his kisses mingled with the tears that rained upon her\r\nshining hair. \"I understand, I understand,\" he murmured brokenly,\r\ngently putting her from him; \"God help us both! Yonder is your way.\r\nHark! he is calling you! I need not go with you. Dry your tears and\r\ngreet him with a smile; perhaps it is better so, for I am not worthy\r\nof you. Some day we shall know--Good-by, my darling. Go, go quickly!\r\nHe must never know that we have met. May God bless and keep you!\"\r\n\r\nHe continued to speak until she had vanished among the clustering\r\nshadows, the weird call of the distant voice punctuating his broken\r\nutterances. When at last she had really gone, and he found himself\r\nactually alone, he fell upon his face in an agony of desolation,\r\nstifling his sobs in the depths of the lush grasses.\r\n\r\nAnd it was a crest-fallen, pallid being who came forth from the\r\ndimness of the woods to relieve Morton's anxiety.\r\n\r\n\"In mercy's name, where have you been?\" he exclaimed, hastening to her\r\nas she emerged into the lambent ways of the moon, and eagerly clasping\r\nher hand in his.\r\n\r\n\"I lost my way,\" she faltered, with downcast eyes, vainly striving to\r\nconceal the tears that glistened upon her lashes.\r\n\r\n\"But you have been weeping!\"\r\n\r\n\"I became confused and frightened,\" she explained. She was about to\r\nadd, \"it seemed so lonesome without you;\" but the words remained\r\nunuttered.\r\n\r\nAs they walked side by side across the dewy lawn, Morton was not so\r\nmuch impressed by the incoherency of the explanation of her present\r\ncondition as by the subtle change which had come over her within those\r\nfew minutes. What could have caused it, he was completely at a loss to\r\nsurmise; what it might portend, he could not conjecture; but that some\r\nmysterious change had taken place in her, he was as certain as though\r\nshe had said in so many words,\r\n\r\n\"You should have been far-sighted enough not to have left me alone for\r\nan instant until I am irrevocably yours!\"\r\n\r\nHe suffered the torture of a lifetime in those few brief moments; and\r\nthe torment was all the more poignant that it was too vague to impart,\r\neven if he had dared so to do.\r\n\r\nLong ere they reached the house, the silence became so oppressive that\r\nin sheer despair he was forced to break it.\r\n\r\n\"I found the book,\" he remarked with effort, displaying the dainty\r\nvolume.\r\n\r\nShe did not offer to take it from him, as he expected, as he fondly\r\nhoped; she simply replied, with eyes intent upon the ground,\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry to have given you so much trouble.\"\r\n\r\nAs if by instinct he felt as if virtue had gone out of him. How, when,\r\nor why, he could not determine, but in that hour an occult warning\r\ncame home to him--a presage that his empire over Romaine Effingham was\r\nno longer supreme.\r\n\r\nHad he known, had he even suspected, that Romaine would weep herself\r\nto sleep that night with Colston Drummond's jewelled miniature upon\r\nher bosom, he would have pulled himself together, banished the spell\r\nthat held him in thrall, and thus averted the catastrophe that the\r\npregnant moments hastened to consummate.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n    \"But shapes that come not at an earthly call\r\n    Will not depart when mortal voices bid.\"\r\n\r\nThe augury of the preceding day's perfection proved correct--Romaine's\r\nnuptial morn came up, veiled in murky clouds that promised a period of\r\ndismal rain. The very face of nature, of late so bright and jocund,\r\nsuffered an obscuration that left it gray and drear. By sun-rise the\r\nmists crept swiftly up the hill-sides, revealed the verdant landscape\r\nfor a moment, and then, as their custom is, descended in a persistent,\r\nchilling downpour.\r\n\r\nMorton and Hubert were the only members of the household to meet at\r\nthe breakfast-table, which the butler had striven to render\r\nresplendent, in honor of the occasion, by masses of ghastly Freesia\r\nand Narcissi.\r\n\r\nThe conversation of the two men during the repast was desultory in the\r\nextreme. There were dark rings around Morton's eyes, which betrayed a\r\nsleepless night; he was nervous and constrained in manner, while the\r\nwan pallor of his face contrasted sharply with the unrelieved\r\nblackness of his garments. It was with evident relief that the\r\nbrothers-elect left the table and separated by tacit consent.\r\n\r\nIt had been agreed that the ceremony should be solemnized in the\r\nconservatory at noon, after which the wedded pair should at once be\r\ndriven to Morton's house in the city. The preparations were of the\r\nsimplest description, if the mere removal of the rustic seats from the\r\nconservatory could be considered such.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, as the appointed hour drew nigh, various wines were placed\r\nupon the sideboard in the dining-room, where a bridal-cake occupied\r\nthe centre of the table, upon which lay bride-roses and\r\nlilies-of-the-valley in richly fragrant garlands. Servants in holiday\r\nattire went hither and thither with muffled step; otherwise the house\r\nmaintained the most sepulchral silence. No sound of approaching\r\nequipage disturbed the rainy day without; even the birds restrained\r\ntheir plaintive twitter beneath the dripping leaves. It was as if some\r\ninvisible dead lay in state during that ominous lull which precedes\r\nthe arrival of the mourners.\r\n\r\nLeft to himself, Morton paced to and fro in the library. He grew\r\ncalmer, but by degrees more pallid, as the hours wore to noon, until,\r\nwhen the clergyman was ushered into his presence, his stern composure\r\nimpressed the man of God as most extraordinary. It was only when the\r\nslowly chiming clocks proclaimed the appointed hour, that Morton\r\nevinced the least animation. He sprang from his chair, while a hectic\r\nglow flashed into his face, and motioned the clergyman to follow him.\r\nScarcely had they entered the conservatory when Romaine appeared,\r\nleaning heavily upon her brother's arm, and similarly supported upon\r\nthe other side by her mother. A very bride of death she looked, her\r\nsplendid attire rather heightening than relieving her pallor. She wore\r\nno jewels, as she had once proposed to do; and she had no need for\r\nthem, since, if ever loveliness needed not the foreign aid of\r\nornament, but was, when unadorned, adorned the most, Romaine Effingham\r\nin her bridal hour proved an exemplar.\r\n\r\nThey guided her faltering steps forward and gave her into Morton's\r\nkeeping. He received her with feverish eagerness, and she seemed to\r\nthrill beneath his touch as he murmured some word into her ear that\r\nsummoned the phantom of an answering smile.\r\n\r\nThereupon ensued an ominous pause, broken only by the servants as they\r\ngrouped themselves at a respectful distance, and by the pitiless\r\npatter of the rain upon the glazed roof overhead.\r\n\r\nThen the solemn words were pronounced which made the twain\r\none--pronounced to the last Amen, without let or hindrance, and\r\nRomaine Morton turned to her husband to receive his kiss. She seemed\r\nstrong and relieved in spirit as she accepted the tearful embraces of\r\nher mother and brother, betraying the while her haste to escape from\r\nthe thraldom of her nuptial robes, and to be gone to meet the new life\r\nupon the threshold of which she stood.\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of her change of costume she seized her\r\nopportunity, when unheeded by her mother, to slip a note, addressed to\r\nColston Drummond, into her maid's hand, with the whispered petition\r\nthat it be delivered as soon as she had left the house. And the loyal\r\nlittle confederate was already upon her way to Drummond Lodge as the\r\ncarriage containing the wedded pair dashed into the sodden country\r\nroad that led citywards.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to state that that day had proved the heaviest of\r\nColston Drummond's existence. It is true that he had brought himself\r\nto that pitch of resignation which closely resembles apathy, but he\r\nsuffered none the less the dull misery that inevitably succeeds acute\r\nanguish.\r\n\r\nThough he was in ignorance of the hour which should make the idol of\r\nhis life another's, it was enough that his doom was destined to be\r\nsealed at some period of the fatal span between sunrise and sunset. In\r\naccordance with his wishes, he had been left in undisturbed solitude\r\nduring the morning hours, and, as he took no heed of the flight of\r\ntime, the servant who intruded to announce the messenger from Belvoir\r\nfound him stretched upon a divan in his sanctum, where he had received\r\nMorton that night, long weeks before.\r\n\r\nPromptly recognizing the maid, he sprang to his feet, breathlessly\r\ndemanding the object of her visit.\r\n\r\n\"I am the bearer of a note from my mistress, sir,\" the girl replied.\r\n\r\n\"From Mrs. Effingham?\"\r\n\r\n\"From Mrs. Morton, sir.\"\r\n\r\nHe wavered for an instant, but, quickly recovering himself, he\r\ngroaned,\r\n\r\n\"Then the marriage has taken place?\"\r\n\r\n\"It has, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what can she want of me?\" he muttered inaudibly, as he accepted\r\nthe missive and broke the seal.\r\n\r\nHe read Romaine's letter to the close with no outward sign of emotion,\r\nbeyond a trembling of the hands, which he was powerless to repress.\r\nSuddenly, however, he raised his eyes, and there was the fire of an\r\ninvincible resolution in their depths as he demanded,\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Morton has left Belvoir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, more than an hour ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you an idea where she has gone?\"\r\n\r\n\"To Doctor Morton's house in the city.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you--stay; you will be faithful to your mistress and--and to\r\nme,\" he added gently, \"and you will keep your errand a secret?\"\r\n\r\n\"You may trust me, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall not forget you.\"\r\n\r\nOnce more alone, he hastened to a window and dashed aside the\r\ndraperies, the better to secure the sickly light that filtered in.\r\n\r\n\"She has set my soul on fire!\" he panted. \"O Romaine, Romaine, it had\r\nbeen wiser to let me live out my allotted time and die in my enforced\r\nresignation!\"\r\n\r\nThen his eyes fled over the lines which Romaine had penned, and which\r\nran as follows:\r\n\r\n\"My dream is dispelled. I have awakened to the reality. God help me!\r\nWas it His will that I should have met you in the eleventh hour? To\r\nwhat purpose? Why could I not have slept on, even unto the end? I have\r\nbeen roused too late. In one hour I shall be a wife; and, with God's\r\nhelp I will prove myself worthy the name. But--O my friend, why should\r\n_I_ have fallen the prey of such an inscrutable fate? You have said\r\nthat some day we shall know. Your words will comfort me and give me\r\nstrength to bear my burden without repining. I shall try to sleep and\r\ndream again, for such is my only refuge. God be with you.\"\r\n\r\nHe crushed the sheet within his palms, while the panoplies about the\r\napartment rang with his exultant cry:\r\n\r\n\"She loves me! Thank God, it is not too late for righteous\r\ninterference so long as she remains a wife in name only! There are\r\nhours between this and night, and all I ask is minutes in which to\r\naccomplish her salvation! Come what may, I will go to her!\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Morton and his bride had sped over the intervening distance\r\nand found themselves safely housed against the storm in his renovated\r\nmansion in the city. Blinds and draperies had been raised to admit\r\nsuch light as there was; rare exotics spent their fragrance upon the\r\ngenial air; and a repast of exceeding daintiness had been spread for\r\ntheir refreshment. Everything had been done which a refined\r\nforethought could suggest--in a word, the cage had been exquisitely\r\ngilded, and was in all respects worthy of the bird.\r\n\r\nBeneath the mystic spell of his presence, Romaine had recovered her\r\ncomposure, and appeared to all intents and purposes her happiest self.\r\nLike a pair of joyous children they wandered from room to room,\r\nadmiring the new splendors; and thus, in due course, they entered the\r\napartment where, enthroned above the mantel and garlanded with pale\r\nblush roses, hung the portrait of Paula. Morton led his wife to a\r\npoint of vantage, and bid her look upward, riveting his eyes upon her\r\nface the while with a hungry longing.\r\n\r\nBefore the blonde loveliness of the Saxon girl, Romaine paled, while a\r\nshudder rent her from head to foot. She sighed heavily, and turned to\r\nMorton with a piteous gesture.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Loyd,\" she murmured sadly, \"never again call me Paula.\"\r\n\r\nHe recoiled from her as though each innocent word had stung him to the\r\nquick.\r\n\r\n\"My God!\" he cried, \"if I thought--\" when he checked himself before\r\nher look of abject terror, came to her, and took her in his arms. \"My\r\ndarling,\" he faltered, \"if you only knew what agony the mere suspicion\r\nof your doubt causes me, you would have pity upon me!\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke with such suppressed passion, with such wild anguish in his\r\nhaggard eyes, that her alarm faded to helpless amazement.\r\n\r\n\"I have expressed no doubt,\" she murmured; \"what can you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I do not know,\" he moaned. \"Perhaps I am not quite myself; all\r\nthe happiness of this day has unnerved me. But--but you bid me never\r\nto call you Paula again; what do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, simply that I am so inferior to her in loveliness,\" she answered\r\nwith a flurried smile.\r\n\r\n\"Did I ask, did I expect, you to look like her?\" he demanded fiercely.\r\n\"Can you not understand that the flesh is dust, and to dust returns;\r\nbut the soul is immortal? Paula's body is dust, but her immortal soul\r\nlives--lives, not in the realms of bliss to which it fled, released,\r\nbut--_where_ does it live to-day, at this very instant? I want to hear\r\n_you_ tell me!\"\r\n\r\nHe caught her delicate shoulders between his strong white hands and\r\nglared like some ravenous animal into her startled face.\r\n\r\n\"Answer me!\" he commanded.\r\n\r\n\"O Loyd,\" she wailed, \"how wildly you speak! How can I tell where her\r\nsoul may be, since I can see no reason why it should not be in\r\nheaven!\"\r\n\r\n\"If it _is_ in heaven,\" he cried, thrusting her violently from him,\r\n\"then am I in hell!\"\r\n\r\nWith a stifled cry, poor Romaine staggered to a chair and sank upon\r\nit, overcome by the conviction that she had allied herself to a\r\nmadman.\r\n\r\nAnd in the ominous pause that ensued, a light rap sounded upon the\r\nclosed door.\r\n\r\nWith a muttered ejaculation Morton pulled himself together and went to\r\ninquire into the untimely intrusion. Upon opening the door, he found\r\nhis man upon the threshold, stammering some words of apology, which\r\nwere summarily cut short.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want?\" Morton demanded sternly.\r\n\r\n\"There is a lady in the office, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are your wits, that you have forgotten your orders? I am not at\r\nhome to patients.\"\r\n\r\n\"But she has called repeatedly, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Send her to Doctor Chalmers, my colleague.\"\r\n\r\n\"She declares that she will not leave without seeing you. Here is her\r\ncard.\"\r\n\r\nThe sight of that graven name seemed for an instant to petrify the\r\nbeholder, and several seconds elapsed ere he was able to command\r\nhimself sufficiently to speak.\r\n\r\nGoing to his shrinking wife, he raised her hand and pressed it to his\r\nlips in a way that was infinitely pathetic.\r\n\r\n\"I must leave you for a moment, to attend to an urgent case,\" he\r\nwhispered; \"and while I am gone, I beseech you to pardon a love which\r\ntranscends all bounds. Some day you will understand all I have\r\nsuffered. Be lenient with me, for I am an object for pity!\"\r\n\r\nIn the dimness of his office, which had undergone no renovation and no\r\ndecoration, he found himself confronted by the tall and slender figure\r\nof a woman whom he knew full well. The veil had been raised from\r\nbefore the appealing beauty of the face which bore but slight traces\r\nof alteration since last he looked upon Margaret Revaleon!\r\n\r\nHis greeting was of so cordial a nature as to preclude all attempt on\r\nthe part of his visitor to apologize for her intrusion.\r\n\r\n\"I am more than glad to see you, Mrs. Revaleon,\" he exclaimed,\r\nexcitedly; \"your visit is most opportune. For the past week you have\r\nbeen omnipresent in my thoughts. Who shall say that I am not\r\ndeveloping something of your own peculiar clairvoyance?\"\r\n\r\n\"I trust not,\" she said, regarding the speaker with apparent\r\nuneasiness.\r\n\r\nBut he continued, with precipitate heedlessness,\r\n\r\n\"And how do you find yourself since last we met?\"\r\n\r\n\"My condition remains unchanged,\" replied the woman. \"Indeed, I am\r\nsatisfied that I have developed into what is popularly known as a\r\nspiritualistic medium. But I am wretched at the thought of being the\r\nunwilling possessor of this so-called odyllic power; and I have come\r\nto you again to beseech you to treat me for a malady which I am\r\nconvinced you can cure if you will.\"\r\n\r\nYielding to his adroit guidance, Margaret Revaleon found herself once\r\nmore seated in the luxurious patient's chair, while the young doctor\r\nseated himself before her with his back to the light.\r\n\r\nThus advantageously placed, he replied with a smile,\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, my dear madam, you overestimate my ability. I do not profess\r\nelectro-biology. In order to do so, I should be obliged to enter upon\r\nan exhaustive course of reading of Reichenbach and his disciples. In\r\npoint of fact, I have no sympathy with the believers in mesmerism and\r\nits concomitant fancies.\"\r\n\r\n\"No?\" she answered dreamily, that singular absence of inspection\r\ndulling her tawny eyes. \"Do you know, doctor, that I am impressed to\r\ntell you that you are possessed of the mesmeric power to an\r\nextraordinary degree?\"\r\n\r\nHe winced consciously, but rejoined soothingly, doing his utmost to\r\nincrease the stupor which was fast gaining command of his visitor,\r\n\r\n\"It may be as you say; it is certainly a power second only to your\r\nown. What else have you to impart? Anything that you might say, I\r\nshould regard as oracular.\"\r\n\r\nHe thrilled from head to foot with a sense akin to sickening\r\nfaintness, as he saw her eye-lids slowly droop while she extended her\r\nslim, white hands to him.\r\n\r\n\"Give me your hands,\" she murmured; \"oh, dear, dear, dear! Stand back;\r\ndo not crowd so! How many there are here!--Ah!\"\r\n\r\nThe final word was simply an exhalation. She slumbered profoundly,\r\nbreathing stertorously at first, but swiftly relapsing into perfect\r\ncalm. The trance had begun. The portals of eternity seemed to be\r\nwidening. The solemnity of the moment was supreme.\r\n\r\nMorton's features became rigid as he watched; his haggard eyes started\r\nfrom their sockets and the drops of an icy sweat pearled upon his\r\nbrow. He had longed for this moment, and yet, now that it was his, he\r\nwould have given his immortal soul to have been able to play the\r\ncoward and escape the consequences.\r\n\r\nIn fact he did withdraw his hands from the slight grasp, but in the\r\nnext moment he was held spell-bound, for Margaret Revaleon was\r\nspeaking in that weirdly vaticinal tone.\r\n\r\n\"Poor Romaine! Where is she?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who speaks? Who are you?\" gasped Morton, once more grasping the\r\noutstretched hands.\r\n\r\n\"Her father. _You_ should know me. I am Sidney--Sidney--\"\r\n\r\n\"Sidney Effingham!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and I am called back to earth in spite of myself. There is\r\ntrouble here among those I dearly love, and I am pained, disturbed in\r\nmy happiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your widow and son are well,\" murmured Morton, profoundly awed by the\r\nimpressive tone of the presence.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes; but Romaine! my daughter, where is she? She is no longer\r\nwith her mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course she is not!\" exclaimed Morton; \"is she not with _you_ in\r\nheaven?\"\r\n\r\nThe violence of the query appeared to disturb the medium; her eyelids\r\nfluttered and her breathing became labored, as though the conditions\r\nof the trance had been deranged. Presently, however, the transient\r\nagitation subsided and a name escaped her lips.\r\n\r\n\"Loyd!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who speaks?\" whispered Morton, vaguely conscious of a change of\r\npersonality.\r\n\r\n\"How can you ask? Can you not guess?\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" he cried wildly; \"O God! I do not dare to guess, even to think!\r\nIn heaven's name, do not tell me who you may be! and--and yet I _must_\r\nknow! I am resolved to dare death itself to be satisfied! Who is it\r\nthat speaks?\"\r\n\r\n\"Paula, your wife--and I am waiting!\"\r\n\r\nThe listening air seemed to cringe before the maddened shriek that\r\nfilled the house.\r\n\r\nMorton struggled to his feet and for a moment hovered above the\r\nquiescent figure beneath him with hands outstretched and hooked like\r\nthe talons of a bird of prey; then with a groan he sank back into his\r\nchair; his arms fell like plummets at his sides and his head dropped\r\nforward upon his breast.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the luxurious chamber over which presided the radiant\r\nportrait of the dead, garlanded in roses, the unhappy bride paced to\r\nand fro, now wringing her delicate hands, and again dashing the\r\nterrified tears from her eyes. Each moment but served to increase her\r\nhelpless alarm; she knew her husband's return to be immediate, at\r\nleast inevitable, and yet she could not support the thought of his\r\nadvent. In a word, the last shackle which bound her soul in mystic\r\nspell had fallen away, and she was herself again. It had required\r\nweeks to right the disordered brain and give it the strength requisite\r\nto battle with the mesmeric power of its master; but at last, late as\r\nit was, her mind had fully regained its normal functions.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of her pitiful quandary Romaine was startled by an\r\nimpetuous step outside the closed door. She recoiled to the furthest\r\ncorner of the room, and stood bracing her fainting body against the\r\nwall.\r\n\r\nContrary to her expectation it was Colston Drummond who flung wide the\r\ndoor and stood before her.\r\n\r\nThe revulsion of feeling well-nigh overpowered her, yet in some way\r\nshe was able to demand, in answer to his passionate utterance of her\r\nname,\r\n\r\n\"Why are _you_ here?\"\r\n\r\n\"To protect you, Romaine.\"\r\n\r\n\"You forget that I can claim a husband's protection,\" she retorted\r\nvaliantly.\r\n\r\n\"It is from him that I seek to protect you,\" Drummond exclaimed; \"you\r\nshould not have written to me as you did, should not have laid bare\r\nyour tortured heart and revealed the secret which I have had every\r\nreason to suspect, which my great love for you divined long, long ago,\r\nif you did not wish me to fly to your rescue!\"\r\n\r\nShe held up beseeching hands, as though she would ward off that which\r\nshe would welcome, and cried piteously,\r\n\r\n\"Too late! It is too late!\"\r\n\r\nWhatever he might have said remained unuttered, since at the moment\r\nthat frenzied cry reached their ears, freezing their blood with its\r\nbaleful import.\r\n\r\n\"Merciful heaven!\" gasped Romaine; \"it is Loyd's voice! Something\r\ndreadful has occurred! Oh, prove yourself my protector, and come with\r\nme! Come, quick, quick!\"\r\n\r\nIn the excitement of the moment, the brooding twilight, and their\r\nunfamiliarity with the house they lost much precious time.
