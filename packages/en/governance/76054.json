The time is, then,\r\nperhaps not inauspicious for an examination of the structure of their\r\norganization in the period of its greatest power and prestige. It is not\r\neasy for the present age to realize how large the empire of Suleiman\r\nbulked in the eyes of contemporaneous Europe. Amid the vast energies\r\nand activities, the magnificent undertakings and achievements, of the\r\nmarvellous sixteenth century, nothing surpassed the manifestations of\r\npower that swept forth from Constantinople. The following pages will have\r\nbeen worth while if their incomplete presentation shadows forth, however\r\ndimly, the secrets of Ottoman greatness and success.\r\n\r\nThis book was originally prepared in partial fulfilment of the\r\nrequirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Harvard\r\nUniversity, and was subsequently awarded the Toppan Prize. The writer\r\ndesires to acknowledge his very great indebtedness for advice,\r\nsuggestion, and criticism to a number of kind friends with whom he has\r\nconsulted, but especially to Professor A. C. Coolidge and Professor G. F.\r\nMoore. Nor can he let the book go to press without recording his extreme\r\nobligation to his wife for unwearying assistance at every stage of its\r\npreparation.\r\n\r\n                                                                  A.

Men die, families decay, the\r\noriginal stock tends to disappear; new individuals are admitted from\r\nwithout, new family groups take the lead, whole tribes are incorporated\r\nand absorbed; after centuries the anthropological result often bears but\r\nslight resemblance to the original type. Undoubtedly the fabric of ideas\r\nwhich a nation weaves as its history develops also undergoes changes\r\nof pattern; old principles pass out of sight, and new ones, born of\r\ncircumstance, or brought in from without, come to controlling influence.\r\nBut ideas are not, like men, mortal: they can be transmitted from man to\r\nman through ages; they can be stored in books and thus pass from the dead\r\nto the living; when built together into a solid and attractive structure,\r\nthey impart to the whole something of their individual immortality.\r\nSingly they pass as readily to strangers as to kindred; when organized to\r\nrounded completeness as the culture of a great living nation, they have\r\na power which lays hold of men of many races, alone or in masses, and in\r\nthe absence of strong prejudice compels acceptance.\r\n\r\nSuch an assimilative force can clearly be seen in vigorous operation in\r\nthe United States of America today. A system of ideas, woven of countless\r\nthreads spun by Egyptian, Babylonian, Hebrew, Greek, Roman, and Teuton,\r\npreserved and enlarged by Frank, Anglo-Saxon, Norman, and Englishman,\r\nrecombined in a new and striking pattern by the founders of the republic,\r\nis thrown over men from every nation under heaven, who under its\r\ninfluence all become of one type, not to be mistaken wherever it is seen.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Ottoman Empire reveals the constant working of a\r\nlike assimilative force. It was not merely, and not even mainly, the\r\ncompulsion of the sword that built up and maintained the strongest\r\nnational power of the sixteenth century. Swords must be wielded by men;\r\nand how were enough strong and capable men found and bound together\r\nin willing coöperation to conquer large sections of Europe, Asia, and\r\nAfrica, to organize and govern their conquests in a fairly satisfactory\r\nfashion, and to establish a structure which, after more than three\r\nhundred years of decay, disaster, and disintegration, has yet enough\r\nstrength to form the basis for a new departure? The only answer possible\r\nis that the attraction of a great body of national ideas gathered men\r\nfrom every direction and many races to unite in a common effort. Although\r\nmuch violence, injustice, and destructive passion was involved, the\r\nresult was a great and on the whole a durable and useful empire.\r\n\r\nThe government of the Ottoman Empire when at the height of its power\r\ncannot be understood from a description of its court, costumes,\r\nceremonies, and officials, with a catalogue of their provinces and\r\nduties. A thorough comprehension of the main political ideas that\r\nconstituted the life of the empire is essential. Since most of these\r\nideas were old and tried, and were wrought in a thousand ways into the\r\ngeneral scheme, a complete treatment would demand that they should be\r\nconsidered historically from the time of their adoption. Nor would it\r\nbe sufficient to go back to the beginning of the house of Osman. The\r\nTurkish nucleus which gathered around him, and the Mohammedans and\r\nChristians from near and far who joined his rising fortunes were already\r\nin possession, in a fairly systematic form, of most of the ideas of the\r\ncompleted Ottoman government. The inquiry should be begun farther back,\r\namong Byzantine Greeks, Seljuk Turks, Mohammedans of Persia and Arabia,\r\nand Turks of Central Asia. Many of the ideas, indeed, can be traced yet\r\nfarther, through Tartary to China and through Parthia and Rome to Babylon\r\nand Egypt.\r\n\r\nThese origins, however, cannot be considered here except in the briefest\r\npossible fashion. All that can be done is to outline the background of\r\nOttoman history, the general character of the Ottoman Empire and its\r\nservice to the world, the racial descent of the Ottoman Turks, and the\r\nmain influences which affected their institutions and culture.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BACKGROUND OF OTTOMAN HISTORY\r\n\r\nFrom early times the developing Chinese civilization in the valley of\r\nthe Yellow River had to contend with intermittent attacks from the\r\nbarbarians of the north and west. In the latter half of the third century\r\nB.C. China’s work of domestic consolidation and centralization reached\r\ncompleteness, and foreign conquest began. The policy was then initiated\r\nwhich has never since been departed from,—the subjugation of the outlying\r\nlands and the cultural assimilation of their inhabitants.[1] Following\r\nup with armies, governors, and garrisons the nomads who fled to the\r\nwest, by the beginning of the second century A.D. China held vassal all\r\nthe population of the steppe country from the Great Wall to the Caspian\r\nSea; her frontiers marched with those of Parthia. Early in the third\r\ncentury she entered upon four hundred years of weakness, and her western\r\npossessions fell away; but she regained strength and restored her western\r\ndominion just in time to confront the rising Saracen flood. During three\r\nbrilliant centuries, the seventh, eight, and ninth of our era, she held\r\nthe nomads in fairly constant subjection, and presumably taught them many\r\nof her orderly, organized ways. It was probably in part by the strength\r\nof her discipline that in the succeeding half-millennium the descendants\r\nof these nomads, Turks and Mongols, wrought their will from the Sea of\r\nJapan to the Adriatic, over most of Asia, half of Europe, and a goodly\r\nportion of Africa.\r\n\r\nFrom the eighth century Turks drifted southwestward in ever-increasing\r\nnumbers out of Chinese territory into the declining Saracen Empire.\r\nEarly in the eleventh century an army followed this course and set up\r\nthe vast but short-lived empire of the Seljuk Turks. These broke the\r\neastern frontier of Asia Minor, which had protected the Greeks and\r\nRomans for fourteen hundred years, and pushed on until they could see\r\nthe domes of Constantinople. The eastward pressure of the crusading\r\nperiod kept them from European shores for two centuries, near the close\r\nof which the Mongols overran their disintegrated lands. A remnant, the\r\nSeljuk Sultanate of Rûm, struggled on in Asia Minor until the close of\r\nthe thirteenth century, when it fell into ten parts. The East Roman, or\r\nByzantine Empire, had by that time also been thoroughly wrecked, and the\r\nBalkan Peninsula was divided among Frank, Italian, and Catalan, Greek,\r\nSerb, Albanian, Wallach, and Bulgarian.\r\n\r\nThe people of one of the ten fragments of the Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm\r\ntook the name of Osmanlis from their chief Osman. Located on the border\r\nof the Greek and Turkish groups of principalities, they drew men and\r\ngovernmental ideas from both. The rapidity of their growth from so small\r\na beginning, and under such apparently unfavorable circumstances, into\r\na durable state is one of the marvellous things of history. In about\r\ntwo and a quarter centuries from the time of their independence they\r\nwere able to attempt for the last time to unite the entire Mediterranean\r\ncivilization into one empire. North Africa, Egypt, Syria, Arabia,\r\nthe Tigris-Euphrates valley, Armenia, Asia Minor, Greece, the Balkan\r\nPeninsula, a large part of modern Austria-Hungary and of modern Russia,\r\nwere theirs; they threatened Italy, Central and Eastern Europe, and\r\nPersia. They thus held all three of the earliest centers of Mediterranean\r\ncivilization, the western half of the Old Persian Empire, and all the\r\ndominions of Rome except the northwestern one-third. Apart from Spain and\r\nthe lands east of the Zagros Mountains, they ruled the Saracen Empire.\r\nWith the exception of Italy (with Illyricum and the adjacent islands) and\r\nthe short-lived Byzantine conquests in Spain, the empire of Justinian\r\nlay within their boundaries. The later Byzantine Empire became the heart\r\nof their dominions, and its two chief supports—the trade which passed\r\nthrough the Bosphorus and the products and men of Asia Minor—became their\r\nown principal supports. The inheritance of lands and of institutions by\r\nthe Ottoman Turks from the two great medieval empires of the Levant, the\r\nSaracen and the East Roman, is by all odds the most pregnant fact of\r\ntheir existence. They were the immediate heirs of a part of the territory\r\nand of the whole of the culture of the Seljuk Turks. The scene of the\r\n“world’s debate” formed but an insignificant part of their dominions.\r\nThey gathered into one net all the shoal of feudal, royal, and imperial\r\npowers which made the Levant of the thirteenth century as decentralized\r\nas the Holy Roman Empire or the Italy of the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARACTER AND MISSION OF THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE\r\n\r\nThis rapid survey leads to a number of significant observations. First,\r\nthe Ottoman Turks of the sixteenth century ruled countries wholly within\r\nthe sphere of the Mediterranean civilization. The only possible exception\r\nwas the steppe lands north of the Black Sea; but these had been almost\r\nas much under the sway of Rome and Constantinople as they ever were\r\nunder that of Stamboul. Even communication with Eastern and Southern\r\nAsia was well-nigh cut off. The road to China north of the Caspian Sea\r\nalone remained open, but after the break-up of the Mongol Empire it had\r\nbecome long and dangerous. The rival and hostile New Persian power firmly\r\nclosed the southern land route to India and China; and even the sea-way\r\nfrom Egypt eastward was blockaded by the newly-arrived Portuguese. Thus\r\nthe Ottoman Empire, except in remote origins, which, indeed, profoundly\r\ninfluenced it, grew and flourished within what is commonly considered\r\nthe main field of history. Accordingly, it has a greater claim upon the\r\nWestern world on the score of kinship than has hitherto generally been\r\nallowed.\r\n\r\nSecond, within the Mediterranean civilization the Ottoman Empire combined\r\nregions of both Orient and Occident. The classical world knew chiefly\r\nRomans, Greeks, and Orientals. The Ottoman Turk succeeded to two-thirds\r\nof this world, the lands of Greece and the East. From the day of Issus\r\nto the day of Menzikert, Asia Minor had to all intents and purposes\r\nbeen a part of Europe. After Menzikert it became a center of Turkish\r\nrule, to which, in the course of time, territories from both Asia and\r\nEurope were added in widening circles. No deep knowledge of historical\r\nforces is necessary to suggest that neither in Southern Europe nor in\r\nAsia Minor itself could the teachings of fourteen centuries or more be\r\nobliterated in five centuries or less, or even in an eternity; nor would\r\nthey fail to exert a profound influence from the moment of conquest. To\r\nregard the Ottoman Empire as a mere Oriental state would be to misread\r\nhistory and to misunderstand human nature. Its lands were of both Orient\r\nand Occident, so also were its people, so also were its culture and its\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThird, the Ottoman Turks drew men and ideas from both Mohammedans and\r\nChristians. They have commonly been regarded as wholly Mohammedan, and\r\ntherefore they have been shut off by a well-nigh impenetrable barrier\r\nfrom the sympathies of a world still possessed by the prejudices of\r\ncrusading days. The foundations of such prejudices are easily open to\r\nattack. The main religious ideas of Mohammedanism are not, except as\r\nto the divinity of Christ, inharmonious with those of Christianity;\r\nthey were, indeed, in all probability drawn chiefly from the religious\r\nteachings of the Old Testament. The social system of Mohammedanism\r\nis also much like that of the Old Testament. Its most objectionable\r\nfeatures, the seclusion of women, polygamy, and slavery, may be regarded\r\nas survivals from an older condition of mankind out of which a portion\r\nof the human race has emerged—not without frequent cases of atavism—and\r\nwhich Mohammedans themselves are tending to abandon. But, leaving aside\r\nthe question of the kinship of Christianity and Mohammedanism, no one can\r\ndeny that the Ottomans ruled over many Christians, that many of their\r\nablest men and families were of Christian ancestry, and that, according\r\nto the nature of humanity, as much of their civilization and ruling ideas\r\nmay have come from Christian as from Mohammedan sources.\r\n\r\nIt is true that as a nation the Ottoman Turks remained Mohammedan; this\r\nhas constituted the real “tragedy of the Turk.” Bound hand and foot by\r\nthat scholastic Mohammedanism which was reaching rigid perfection at the\r\ntime when the Turks first became prominent in the Saracen Empire, and\r\nwhich only in very recent days seems tending toward a Reformation, they\r\ncould not amalgamate the subject Christian peoples, already confirmed\r\nin nationalism by the events of centuries. The deadening system stilled\r\ntheir active spirits, imprisoned their extraordinary adaptability,\r\nand held them at a stage of culture which, though in some respects it\r\ndistinctly led Europe in the sixteenth century, was before long passed\r\nthrough and left behind by the progressive West. Nevertheless, the Turks\r\nwere no more limited to Mohammedan ideas than to Mohammedan men, and they\r\nare entitled to be considered in the light of their double origin.\r\n\r\nFourth and last, the great task before the Ottoman Turks was a work of\r\nunification. Lands which had been united under the great Theodosius, and\r\nthen during eleven centuries had been more and more disintegrated by\r\ninvasion of German, Slav, Arab, Tatar, and Turk, by war of Byzantine,\r\nPersian, Moslem, Crusader, and Mongol, by destruction of roads and safe\r\nwater-routes, and by general decay of civilization, until confusion\r\nand disorder reigned and anarchy seemed not far ahead—these lands were\r\nonce more brought under a single control. Was it their destiny to be\r\ngenuinely reunited, not merely in a common subjection, not merely by\r\nan external shell of authority, but in the pulsing life of a vigorous\r\nnation, harmonious in every part and run through by patriotism? This\r\nwas the well-nigh insoluble problem which the Ottoman Turks attempted\r\nbravely. How they solved the administrative and governmental phase of it\r\nthe present treatise will try to show. Religious unity was out of the\r\nquestion; and in the sixteenth century, in East and West alike, social\r\nand cultural unity waited upon the religious. Had the Ottoman Empire\r\nbeen able four hundred years ago to set apart religious considerations\r\nas matters for the individual—a process which affords the chief hope of\r\nthe new Turkey of the twentieth century—her whole subsequent history must\r\nhave been very different.\r\n\r\nBut in the measure in which unity was attained in the Levant under the\r\nOttoman authority, in that measure did the Ottoman Empire render service\r\nto civilization and humanity. After the close of the thirteenth century\r\nWestern Europe, absorbed in its own affairs, was able to give little\r\nattention to the East. Two centuries were taken up with the consolidation\r\nof national powers, chiefly at the expense of feudalism and the medieval\r\nchurch. By the sixteenth century a measure of internal solidarity had\r\nbeen attained and the struggle for external supremacy over the West\r\nhad been begun. The whole situation was complicated by the actively\r\nleavening force of the New Learning and the explosively rending force\r\nof the Reformation. Under such circumstances even the advance of the\r\nTurks into Central Europe could only temporarily divert attention from\r\nabsorbing problems and direct it toward the East. To what a state of\r\nminute division and infinite disorder the Levant would have come by that\r\ntime, had the Ottoman Empire not grown up, can only be imagined. Egypt,\r\nthe only Levantine power of consequence after the close of the crusades,\r\nhad reached the natural limits of her dominion, and had she aimed at\r\nwider conquests the Mameluke government would scarcely have been capable\r\nof imperial sway. No other of the countless principalities of the eastern\r\nMediterranean showed enough life to accomplish unity. But the Ottoman\r\nTurks, cruelly and destructively, imperfectly and clumsily, yet surely\r\nand effectively, built up and maintained a single authority, to which the\r\nworld probably owes most of that measure of enlightenment, culture, and\r\norder which can be found in the Levant today.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RACIAL DESCENT OF THE OTTOMAN TURKS\r\n\r\nThe question as to the origin of the Ottoman Turks was raised in Western\r\nEurope as soon as the race began to appear upon the stage of history.\r\nThere seemed to be something mysterious and uncanny about their rise to\r\npower. If an innumerable horde of strange barbarians, a second invasion\r\nof Attila, had overrun the Levant and settled down to rule its conquests,\r\ncause and effect would have been apparent. But this nation seemed to\r\narise out of the earth. Organized and disciplined beyond any parallel in\r\nthe West, it seemed to come from nowhere and to begin at once to take\r\na very real part in human affairs.[2] The problem of its origin is by\r\nno means completely solved as yet, but the main elements can perhaps be\r\noutlined. A search for these carries the inquiry to the steppe lands.\r\n\r\nThe great band of open country which stretches with hardly a break across\r\nthe whole of Asia and far into Europe resembles the ocean both in its\r\nvastness and in its character as an intermediate region through which\r\nthe travel of commerce, statesmanship, religion, learning, and curiosity\r\ncan pass between more thickly-settled lands. It differs from the ocean,\r\nhowever, in being everywhere more or less habitable. The ethnic relations\r\nof its families, tribes, and nations are by no means clear. China,\r\nwith a markedly Mongolian population, lay at the east and southeast;\r\nIndo-Europeans of the Caucasian race dwelt at the southwest and west. The\r\ntribes between seem from the earliest recorded times to have presented\r\nevery intermediate stage of physical type, as they do now; and in general\r\nthe shading from yellow to white appears to have proceeded regularly from\r\neast to west, a circumstance that may have been due largely to climatic\r\ninfluence, but was probably far more the result of admixture.[3] These\r\npeoples were given to frequent warfare, one of whose objects was the\r\ncapture of men, women, and children as the most valuable booty. They\r\nseem to have had no race aversions that would hinder inter-mixture,\r\nand no race pride that would prevent captives, in the course of time,\r\nfrom attaining full equality in any rank to which their abilities could\r\ncarry them. Accordingly, the process of admixture that can be observed in\r\nhistoric times has probably been followed from the remote past.\r\n\r\nThe name Tatars may be used to designate all the inhabitants of the\r\nsteppe-ocean who were not distinctly Caucasian. By geographical\r\ndesignation they are properly called the Ural-Altaic peoples, while\r\nethnically they constitute the Mongolo-Turki group.[4] Included perhaps\r\namong those unclassified peoples who were known of old to the Greek\r\nas Scythians, to the Persians as Turanians, and to the Chinese as\r\n_Hiung-nu_, the Tatars, despite many differences, show unmistakable\r\nkinship, usually in their physical features, always in their language\r\nand institutions. They have been grouped since medieval times into two\r\ngreat divisions, the Mongols and the Turks. This division may be said to\r\ncorrespond in a very general way to their greater and lesser resemblance\r\nto the Chinese, and to a narrower and wider geographical separation from\r\nChina. Many tribes possess such intermediate characteristics that they\r\ncannot easily be classified as Turks or Mongols;[5] but a tribe that is\r\nmarkedly like the Chinese is clearly Mongol, and a tribe that differs\r\nwidely from the Chinese is clearly Turkish. If these explanations be\r\nadopted, the Turkish peoples are then in general those Tatars who have\r\nhad the greatest admixture of Caucasian blood. Their original seat seems\r\nto have been in Mongolia, but in historic times they had come to occupy\r\nthe whole central part of the steppe region, from the Desert of Gobi to\r\nthe Volga, in contact with their Mongol kindred on the east and with\r\nIranians on the south and Slavs on the west. The theory of admixture\r\nreceives support from the fact that the peoples of the Mediterranean\r\ncivilization found Mongolians repulsive in appearance, but prized Turkish\r\nslaves for their beauty.[6]\r\n\r\nThe name Turk does not appear prominently in the Byzantine and Chinese\r\nannals before the fifth century A.D., when the people of a Tatar empire\r\nwere designated Τοῦρκοι and _Tu-kiu_.[7] The word _Turcae_ was used by\r\nclassical writers soon after the beginning of the Christian era.[8] The\r\nname has been suspected of lying hidden in the _Targitaos_ of Herodotus\r\nand the _Togharmah_ of Scriptures. However this may be, ancestral peoples\r\npossessing the characteristics of the Turks of course existed, and\r\nperhaps appeared in history, in very early times.\r\n\r\nSome have suggested that the Sumero-Accadians of Babylonia were Turks,\r\nbut this question hardly bears on the present subject. The relations of\r\nTurks and Persians on the Central Asian frontier is much more apropos.\r\nThe legends of the long wars of Iran and Turan, however little detailed\r\nhistorical value they may have, illustrate the circumstances of continual\r\ncontact both in war and in peace.[9] Princes and nobles whose lives\r\nwere forfeit in their own country fled over the border; princesses were\r\nexchanged in marriage; and unnumbered thousands of less exalted folk\r\npassed the frontier as captives or slaves. The frontier itself was not\r\nfixed, but left great regions now to the rule of the Persian and now\r\nto the rule of the Turk. The Parthians may have been Turks.[10] After\r\ntheir downfall the lines of Persian and Turk were drawn sharply by the\r\nnationalist Sassanians. From the middle of the fifth century, indeed, the\r\nPersians had their fill of wars with the Ephthalites, whose appellation\r\nof White Huns may indicate their mixed Mongolian and Caucasian origin;\r\nthe Chinese annals specify the kinship of the _Tie-le_ with the _Tu-kiu_.\r\nNo sooner had the Arabs engulfed Persia than they began to welcome the\r\nTurks whom they found to the north, and whose semi-nomadic culture was\r\nsingularly like their own. The Saracen Empire was administered for about\r\na century chiefly by Arabs, for another century chiefly by Persians,\r\nand after that chiefly by Turks, who rose rapidly through slavery and\r\nmilitary service to the rule of provinces and even of kingdoms. Thus\r\ngreat numbers of Turks came or were brought into many parts of Western\r\nAsia. When Toghrul, grandson of Seljuk, led the first great Turkish\r\ninvasion into the heart of the Saracen Empire, he found his kindred\r\neverywhere. Under the Seljuk Sultans large numbers of Turks streamed in\r\nand were settled in Persia, Azerbaijan, Syria, and Asia Minor.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish occupation of Asia Minor has been called the most thorough\r\npiece of work done by the race.[11] Few details of it have been recorded,\r\nbut one great fact stands out: under the Byzantine Empire, Asia Minor was\r\nGreek, Christian, and the home of the empire’s most vigorous and loyal\r\ncitizens; under the Ottoman Empire, Asia Minor is Turkish, Mohammedan,\r\nand the home of the empire’s most vigorous and faithful subjects.\r\nThe process of this transformation, so far as it is known, deserves\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELJUK AND OTTOMAN TURKS IN ASIA MINOR\r\n\r\nThe Seljuk Turks were orthodox, and often fanatical, Moslems; accordingly\r\nthey put great pressure upon the inhabitants of the peninsula to make\r\nthem exchange Christ for Mohammed. “Great numbers apostatized, ‘many\r\nthousand children were marked by the knife of circumcision; and many\r\nthousand captives were devoted to the service or the pleasures of their\r\nmasters.[12]’”\r\n\r\nThe Seljuk Turks were already a mixed race, and had no greater objection\r\nthan their ancestors to the reception of new members. They had come as a\r\nTurkish army followed by a host of Turcoman nomads.[13] The soldiers took\r\nwives from the women of the land and servants from the men and children,\r\nand the nomads filled the gaps left among their women and children after\r\nthe long, hard journey. Those of the adult Anatolians who were left\r\nfree found a thousand temporal advantages in following the Prophet,\r\nwhose simple faith and consoling doctrines, moreover, suited both their\r\ntemperament and their circumstances. Christianity had sat lightly upon\r\nmany of them, and Mohammedanism seems to have been accepted as lightly;\r\nfor traces of Christian and perhaps of pre-Christian practices and\r\nbeliefs can be seen among the Moslems of Asia Minor today.[14] To turn\r\nMoslem was then, as ever since, to turn Turk. In the course of three\r\ncenturies the process of settlement and conversion reached virtual\r\ncompletion; nearly all the plateau of Asia Minor became Mohammedan and\r\nTurkish. Nothing approaching the nature of statistics is available for\r\ndetermining what the proportion was between invading Turks and converted\r\nChristians. The probabilities, based on the known character of Turkish\r\ninvasions and the length and difficulty of the journey from the steppe\r\nlands, point to a relatively small number of Turkish settlers.[15] Yet\r\nthis doubly-mixed people has contributed those subjects of the Ottoman\r\nEmpire who are accounted the most characteristically Turkish.\r\n\r\nThe invasion of Western Asia by the Mongols of Genghis Khan in the\r\nearly part of the thirteenth century drove an unknown number of\r\nPersians and Turks to take refuge in Asia Minor. Among these is said\r\nto have been a group led by a chief named Suleiman, whose grandson\r\nOsman gave the Ottomans their name.[16] This group reached the Seljuk\r\nkingdom of Rûm, and was allowed by good custom of the time to proceed\r\nto the Christian frontier and conquer what it could. About the time of\r\nsettlement tradition specifies the number as four hundred families, or\r\n444 horsemen, a figure which has clearly been shaped with reference to\r\nthe sacred number four, but which shows the belief that the group was\r\nnot large.[17] The growth of this band was far more rapid than could\r\nhave been accomplished by natural increase. A part of the additional\r\nmembership was supplied by Turks and other Moslems of adventurous spirit\r\nwho sought the fighting and booty of the border-land. But these were by\r\nno means all. The Ottoman traditions and history reveal at countless\r\nplaces the hospitable incorporating spirit of the embryonic nation,\r\nwhich rapidly increased its numbers from the Christian population by\r\nconversion, marriage, and capture, and most strikingly by the tribute\r\ntax of Christian male children. The Ottoman conquests to the eastward\r\nbrought gradually into the brotherhood all the Seljuk Turks of Asia\r\nMinor, and as many as were or became Mohammedan from the various\r\nconquered peoples—Greeks of Trebizond, Armenians, Syrians, and others.\r\nThe conquests in Europe converted _en masse_ some sections of Bulgarians\r\nand Albanians, who still show evidence of their origin; a very great\r\nnumber of individuals among the subject Christians, however, were so\r\ncompletely incorporated as to lose all trace of their source. Thousands\r\nupon thousands of captives from the whole of Southeastern Europe, from\r\nall of Southern Russia and Poland, from the Caucasus region, from Central\r\nEurope as far as Regensburg and Friule, and from the shores and islands\r\nof the Mediterranean were likewise incorporated; till, as a result of all\r\nthis Western admixture, the ruling nationality of the Ottoman Empire,\r\nthough called Turkish today, retains no physical trace whatever of\r\nMongolian ancestry.[18] Many of its members undoubtedly have no Tatar\r\nblood in their veins; as for the rest, they are, if the above discussion\r\nbe well founded, a mixture of Europeans chiefly with Turks of Asia\r\nMinor, who were themselves a mixture of the former Christian population\r\nwith Seljuk Turks, while these again were a mixture dating back through\r\ncountless ages of contact between the white and the yellow races. A\r\nsimple computation will illustrate the matter. Osman is said to have\r\ncaptured a fair Greek lady named Nenuphar, or Nilufer, the Lotus-flower,\r\nand to have given her as bride to his son Orchan, the first of the\r\nOttoman sultans.[19] From that time it became increasingly the policy of\r\nthe sultans to take their wives from the Caucasian race.[20] If Orchan\r\nbe set down as of pure Mongolian descent, and if it be supposed, as is\r\ncertainly very near the truth, that all the mothers of succeeding sultans\r\nwere not of Turkish blood, and if the mother be assumed to contribute to\r\nthe child an influence equal to the father’s, the proportion of Mongolian\r\nblood in the veins of the reigning sultan, who is of the twentieth\r\ngeneration from Orchan, can readily be calculated,—about one part in one\r\nmillion.[21] Similar proportions would hold good for many of the Osmanli\r\nTurks. Probably the nation as a whole has no more of Tatar blood than the\r\nAmerican nation has of Norman.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOURCES OF OTTOMAN CULTURE\r\n\r\nThe question at once arises: What significance, then, has the name Turk\r\nas applied to modern Turkey? To this query a general answer only can be\r\ngiven here, as part of a rough statement in regard to the derivation of\r\nthe main elements of Ottoman culture.\r\n\r\nOf the whole body of ideas and institutions and intangible inheritances\r\npossessed by the Ottoman Turks in the sixteenth century, no small number\r\nof the most fundamental ones were derived from the remote Tatar ancestors\r\nof a part of the nation, from whom even this part was far separated\r\nin time and space. Foremost among these inheritances is the Turkish\r\nlanguage, which in its principles of monosyllabic stem, inflexion by\r\npostfixes alone, and assonance, and in its general system of grammar and\r\nbody of words of ordinary life, has survived from the early days through\r\nall vicissitudes.[22] Old Turkish is the Anglo-Saxon of the Osmanli, as\r\nPersian is his Greek and Arabic his Latin. Somewhat more hospitable than\r\nthose who use Western languages, the Turk has nearly always accepted with\r\na foreign thing its foreign name; and the great majority of the foreign\r\nwords and phrases so accepted he has not changed in any way, except to\r\nmodify the pronunciation of some sounds about which the tongue does not\r\nreadily curl. Among other Tatar bequests to the Osmanlis may be named\r\nthe hospitable assimilative tendency to which reference has already been\r\nmade; a predisposition to war and conquest, accompanied by an openness\r\nof mind as to the best methods and means of prevailing; an ability and\r\ninclination to govern, combined with great adaptability as to methods and\r\nmeans; and some acquaintance with systematic and bureaucratic methods\r\nof government impressed upon the nation by the Chinese. Again, the\r\nTatars, possessed of the tenacious conservatism of a primitive people,\r\npredisposed the Ottomans to a close adherence to custom—to the doctrine\r\nthat, when a thing had been done once in a certain way, it should always\r\nthereafter be done in the same way. Finally, the Tatars contributed\r\nvarious elements of the national character, such as a touch of the old\r\nlove of nomad life, a certain stolidity of spirit and calm sobriety of\r\ntemper (taught, perhaps, by the vastness of the steppe in comparison with\r\nthe littleness of man), and a lack of originality which hindered the\r\nconstruction of freely-borrowed ideas into new forms of higher relation.\r\nIn general, therefore, the foundations of the national character of the\r\nOttomans were laid in the early days, in a body of ideas which was passed\r\ndown continuously from man to man, not so much through blood-relationship\r\nas through willing acceptance or enforced adoption.\r\n\r\nThe nature of a Tatar nation in the steppe lands, manifesting many of\r\nthe elements mentioned above, is extremely significant as foreshadowing\r\nsome features of the Ottoman government. A Tatar nation was a voluntary\r\nassociation, independent of kinship, formed about a promising leader, and\r\ninterested in war and conquest; thus it might grow with extreme rapidity\r\nuntil the geographical extent of its dominion would be marvellous. The\r\nempire of the _Tu-kiu_, for example, gathered in about twenty-five years\r\nafter its foundation territories which reached from China proper to the\r\nconfines of the Byzantine Empire. The leader of such a nation maintained\r\nhis control by the right voluntarily given him to punish treason and\r\nconspiracy by death;[23] when his controlling hand grew weak, the nation\r\nwent to pieces. “A Turkish tribe could maintain a political organization\r\nand a compact grouping only by war; without benefits from pillage and\r\ntributes, it would be obliged to dissolve and to disperse by clans, whose\r\nfractions would group themselves anew, and form another nation about\r\nthe strongest man.... In regard to empires like those of the Huns, or\r\nthe Turks, military associations without ethnic bonds, one cannot say\r\nthat they dissolve; they disband. Reversing the custom of other peoples,\r\nwith the Turks it is the king who feeds his people, who clothes them,\r\nwho pays them.”[24] Add to this system a loyalty to a hereditary leader\r\nwhich makes the bonds of union permanent, and the description would apply\r\nfairly well to the growing Ottoman nation. A passage from the _Kudatku\r\nBilik_ applies yet more closely, since it shows a military government in\r\nthe midst of a subject population:[25]—\r\n\r\n    “In order to hold a land one needs troops and men;\r\n    In order to keep troops one must divide out property;\r\n    In order to have property one needs a rich people;\r\n    Only laws create the riches of a people:\r\n    If one of these be lacking all four are lacking;\r\n    Where all four are lacking, the dominion goes to pieces.”\r\n\r\nThe ancient Persian seems to have given the Ottoman at long range a\r\nnumber of his ideas of government, such as the exaltation of the monarch,\r\nthe separation of officials of the court from those of the government\r\nproper, the division of the ministry into five departments, the council\r\nof state, the giving of large powers to local governors, and the\r\nbeginnings of the so-called “legal” system of taxation.[26] From him also\r\nseems to have come the policy of allowing subjects who professed alien\r\nreligions to form separate organizations, which lived in a measure under\r\ntheir own laws. One writer goes so far as to say: “All investigations\r\ninto the oldest state regulations of the Orient, into the origin of\r\nmonarchical forms and constitutions, into the ceremonial of courts and\r\nthe hierarchy of officials, lead back to the great kingdom of the ancient\r\nPersians, from whom they have come down more or less modified, to the\r\nArabs, who sat as caliphs on the thrones of the three continents, to\r\nthe Seljuk Turks and the Byzantines, who at the same time grew up on\r\nthe ruins of the Saracen and Roman kingdoms in Asia and Europe, and\r\nthrough both to the Ottomans who swallowed up the kingdoms of Iconium\r\nand Byzantium.”[27] The Sassanian Persians handed down through the\r\nMoslems the completed “legal” system of a land tax of two sorts based on\r\ncadasters, and a capitation tax levied on those who practised a foreign\r\nreligion. They may also have contributed many features of the Ottoman\r\nfeudal system. During the Abbassid period the Persians and the Turks who\r\ngradually displaced the Arabs in the civil and military administration of\r\nthe Saracen Empire were thrown into very close contact with each other.\r\nIt was only natural, therefore, that the Persians, who possessed the more\r\nadvanced culture, should influence the Turks in many directions. Their\r\nchief direct gift lay in the domain of poetry and literature, a field in\r\nwhich they added a vast number of words and ideas to the original Turkish\r\nstock.\r\n\r\nThe Saracens gave the Ottomans a complete religious and social system,\r\nunited under a Sacred Law which professed to provide for all relations\r\nof life, and which became more and more rigid as time went on. Into this\r\nhad been wrought slowly by generations of learned men most of the Persian\r\ngovernmental ideas that have been mentioned, together with others from\r\nArabian and Byzantine sources, such as a species of laws of inheritance\r\nand a system of juristic responses. The Saracens gave also their alphabet\r\nand a large stock of Arabic words. All that the Moslems gave the Ottomans\r\nwas embodied in one great, complex institution, which was founded upon an\r\nelaborate system of education and supported by the revenues from a large\r\npart of the land of the empire, and which possessed great solidity and\r\nan almost changeless permanence. In the Ottoman Empire, as in all other\r\nMoslem lands, the influence of this completed institution was ultimately\r\nvery injurious; when added to the Tatar love of custom, it laid a heavy\r\nhand on all movements toward improvement and progress. Its ultimate\r\nattitude toward earthly affairs is well expressed in the following\r\ncouplet:—\r\n\r\n    “To build in this world palaces and castles, there is no need;\r\n    They will at last be ruins: to build cities, there is no need.”[28]\r\n\r\nA development which took place among the Turks within the Saracen Empire\r\nwas of the profoundest significance to Ottoman history. From some date\r\nin the early ninth century, Turkish youth were brought to Bagdad in\r\nlarge numbers as purchased, but by no means unwilling, slaves. Having\r\nbeen trained as soldiers, they became generals and local governors, and\r\nafter no great length of time the central government also passed into\r\ntheir hands. The training of such young Turkish slaves in the palaces of\r\ncaliphs and governors clearly foreshadowed Ottoman methods. The account\r\nthat perhaps looks farthest back in relation to the Turks is found in the\r\n_Siasset Namèh_, and refers to the time of the Samanid dynasty, which\r\nruled in East Persia from 874 to 999. It describes the external aspect of\r\nthe system of education, such as promotion and marks of honor, but leaves\r\nthe severe work which lay behind to be inferred:—\r\n\r\n“This is the rule that was followed at the court of the Samanids:\r\n\r\n“They advanced slaves gradually, taking account of their services, their\r\ncourage, and their merit. Thus a slave who had just been purchased served\r\nfor one year on foot. Clothed in a cotton tunic, he walked beside the\r\nstirrup of his chief; they did not have him mount on horseback either in\r\npublic or in private, and he would be punished if it were learned that he\r\nhad done so. When his first year of service was ended, the head of the\r\nchamber informed the chamberlain, and the latter gave the slave a Turkish\r\nhorse which had only a rope in its mouth, a bridle and a halter in one.\r\nWhen he had served one year on horseback, whip in hand, he was given a\r\nleathern girth to put about the horse. The fifth year they gave him a\r\nbetter saddle, a bridle ornamented with stars, a tunic of cotton mixed\r\nwith silk, and a mace which he suspended by a ring from his saddle-bow.\r\nIn the sixth year he received a garment of a more splendid color; and in\r\nthe seventh year, they gave him a tent held up by a pole and fixed by\r\nsixteen pegs: he had three slaves in his suite, and he was honored with\r\nthe title of head of a chamber; he wore on his head a hat of black felt\r\nembroidered with silver and he was clothed with a silk robe. Every year\r\nhe was advanced in place and dignity; his retinue and his escort were\r\nincreased until the time when he reached the rank of chief of squadron\r\nand finally that of chamberlain. Though his capacity and merit might be\r\ngenerally recognized, though he had done some noteworthy deed and had\r\nacquired universal esteem and the affection of his sovereign, he was\r\nobliged nevertheless to wait until the age of thirty-five years before\r\nobtaining the title of _emir_ and a government.”[29]\r\n\r\nIn this system of the training of slaves for war and government lay the\r\nnucleus of the fundamental institution of the Ottoman state, which,\r\ntogether with the institution based on the Sacred Law, was to sum up\r\npractically the entire organized life of the Ottoman nation. Under\r\nthe Samanids it was Turkish boys who were thus educated by Arabs and\r\nPersians, but the Ottomans were later to apply the same principle to the\r\neducation of Christian youth.\r\n\r\nThe Seljuk Turks brought most of the ideas that have been mentioned into\r\nAsia Minor. They served chiefly as mediators between the older Turkish,\r\nPersian, and Mohammedan systems and that of the Ottomans. Besides\r\nadding some features out of their own experience, such as a method of\r\nbook-keeping, and handing on a taste for constructing public buildings\r\nlike caravanserais, khans, and mosques, they gave rise to several\r\nimportant religious orders which were to have a place in Ottoman life.\r\n\r\nWhat was left for the Byzantines to contribute to the Ottoman? He had\r\nreceived already the main features of his national character,—language,\r\nliterary influences, law, and religion. One of his two leading\r\ninstitutions was already almost fully developed in Moslem lands, and\r\nrequired only transplantation. The other, however, the institution of war\r\nand government, could still be modified considerably; and this was to\r\nincorporate much from the Byzantines.[30] Many details of governmental\r\norganization, both imperial and local, a supplementary system of\r\ntaxation, a greatly elaborated taste for court ceremonial and splendor,\r\na plan of organizing foreign residents under a special law, and a host\r\nof lesser usages and customs were to be taken over by the Ottomans.\r\nThe Ottoman feudal system also probably owed its final form to the\r\nByzantines; and perhaps it was from them that the Ottomans learned their\r\nabnormal love for fees and gifts. The matchless structure of Saint Sophia\r\nserved as a model for the superb mosques that lift the shapely masses of\r\ntheir great gray domes, supported by clusters of semidomes and lesser\r\ndomes, above the cypress trees and gardens of the rounded hills which in\r\nConstantine’s city slope down to the blue waters of the Sea of Marmora,\r\nthe Bosphorus, and the Golden Horn.\r\n\r\nThis sketch of the origin of the elements of Ottoman culture does not\r\nprofess to be in any sense complete. So great a subject is worthy of\r\nseparate and extended treatment. No more has been attempted here than\r\npartly to prepare the way for an understanding of the strange system\r\nof government which the Ottoman Turks developed, and to show that that\r\nsystem was no new creation, but was made of elements which in their\r\norigins reached far back into the past. Out of old and tried ideas was\r\nbuilt up a double structure which was individual, conservative, and\r\nefficient, strong, durable, and useful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE CHARACTER OF THE OTTOMAN STATE IN GENERAL\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITION\r\n\r\nThe Ottoman Turkish state of the sixteenth century was a despotism,\r\nlimited and supported by the Mohammedan Sacred Law; it governed a vast\r\nterritory, which had been gathered by the progressive conquest of\r\nmany separate lands, and which was consequently held in many diverse\r\nrelationships; it ruled a multitude of peoples, some of which were\r\nfavored as holding to the state religion, and others of which, though in\r\nan inferior position, had yet the right by sacred compacts to practise\r\nother religions and obey other laws.\r\n\r\nThis description reveals at once the complex and parti-colored character\r\nof the Ottoman Empire at the period when its power and prestige were\r\ngreatest, when its armies were feared from the shore of the German\r\nOcean to the borders of India and its fleets from Gibraltar to Bombay,\r\nand when its favor and goodwill were sought by powers great and small\r\nin Asia, Africa, and Europe. For the state as for the individual, the\r\npenalty of greatness is increase of responsibility and care. In any\r\nconquering nation the growth of governmental institutions must keep pace\r\nwith increase of territory and population, or advance will be stifled\r\nby confusion. The growth may, however, be too rapid to be intelligently\r\ndirected. Most great institutions, in fact, tend to develop a separate\r\nlife of their own which may become too vast and powerful for human\r\ncomprehension and control; for political, religious, economic, and social\r\nforces proceed out of and act upon them in numerous and unexpected\r\nways. In the case of the Ottoman Empire the situation was rendered\r\nmore difficult by the presence in its territory of stable and vigorous\r\ninstitutions centuries older than its own. These were profoundly hostile\r\nto its inner spirit, far too powerful and individual to be destroyed or\r\nabsorbed by it, and therefore an eternal obstacle to unity. In addition,\r\nthe Ottoman institutions themselves grew more and more apart into two\r\nunified groups, which were in striking contrast in many ways; dwelling\r\ntogether, they acted upon each other continually; and unfortunately they\r\nwere so constituted that their reciprocal influence was to the injury of\r\nboth. A fuller explanation will make the complicated situation clearer.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIMITATIONS ON DESPOTISM\r\n\r\nIt may seem a contradiction in terms to speak of a despotism as limited;\r\nyet a little reflection will show that there never has existed and never\r\ncan exist a despotism that is not limited. In what land has the will of\r\none man been obeyed instantly, everywhere, and by all? In what land have\r\nthere not been stubborn traditions, ineradicable prejudices, and powerful\r\norganizations, which have blocked the way of the despot as effectively\r\nas lofty mountains and stormy channels? The great limitation upon the\r\npower of the Ottoman sultan was the _Sheri_, or Sacred Law of Islam,\r\nwhich claimed to be wholly above him and beyond his alteration.[31] He\r\nmight by act of violence transgress its provisions, but he had even\r\nthen done it no damage; it was still what it had always been. And he\r\nknew well that his transgressions must not be too many, and must not at\r\nall touch certain matters, else he would be declared to have forfeited\r\nthe throne.[32] The Sacred Law divided with him the allegiance of his\r\nMohammedan subjects; it demanded to be consulted before he removed the\r\nhead of a criminal,[33] or went to war with an enemy;[34] it took for\r\nitself the revenues of a large share of his lands, and so controlled the\r\nimposition of general taxation as seriously to embarrass his finances; it\r\neven protected his Christian subjects from all efforts of his to bring\r\nthem forcibly under its sway;[35] it entered into his very spirit and\r\npersuaded him to relinquish harmless pleasures,[36] while it supported\r\nhim in the execution of able and worthy brothers and sons.[37] The\r\n_Sheri_ was a form of rigid constitution which by its own provisions\r\nwas incapable of amendment. It purported to regulate for all time the\r\nmatters included in its scope. Open to a small measure of modification\r\nby juristic interpretation, it was probably on the whole as changeless\r\na system as has ever prevailed among men. The sovereign had no right to\r\nmodify it in the least respect.\r\n\r\nNor was the Sacred Law the only real limitation upon the sultan’s power.\r\nAlthough he was not bound to observe the legislation of his ancestors or\r\nmaintain their institutions,[38] yet he could not lightly destroy what\r\nhe must at once replace. Some of their laws he might cease to observe,\r\nsome institutions he might neglect, improve, or reform; but the main\r\nsubstance of their work was too useful and too well-established to be\r\nundone. Suleiman bears the name of Legislator (_El Kanuni_); but in his\r\ncase it was even more true than in similar instances in other lands that\r\nhe did not so much ordain and create anew as rearrange and put in order,\r\nreorganize and regulate.\r\n\r\nAgain, few other peoples in the world, perhaps, have been so much under\r\nthe power of custom as was the Ottoman nation.[39] That which had\r\nbeen once done in a certain way must always be done in the same way,\r\nor in what was believed to be the same way, unless a change had been\r\naccomplished by the distinct intervention of fully recognized authority.\r\nThe inertia of the people was so marked that the sovereign power seldom\r\nfound it worth while, and then only when driven by necessity, to put\r\nforth the great exertion required to make a change in the established\r\norder.\r\n\r\nRestricted thus by an unchangeable constitution, by the presence of\r\ndeep-rooted laws and institutions, and by the settled customs of a highly\r\nconservative people, the power of the Ottoman sultan could be exerted\r\nfreely in certain directions only. What these were will appear as the\r\nscheme of the government is unfolded.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TERRITORIAL BASIS\r\n\r\nA fundamental characteristic of the modern state is considered to\r\nlie in the fact that its power is territorial, that it exerts equal\r\nauthority over every part of a certain territory, and over every human\r\nbeing and every material object upon, above, or under the surface of\r\nthat territory. Although an authority so evenly applied may be possible\r\ntheoretically, it is never in actual existence in any particular\r\nstate; for special laws and arrangements always modify the situation.\r\nFor example, lands and property devoted to religious or educational\r\nuses, or owned by a foreign nation for its ambassador, are regularly\r\nexempted from taxation. Or, again, the government of the United States\r\nof America stands in different relations toward the soil of the District\r\nof Columbia, the state of Massachusetts, the territory of Alaska, the\r\nPhilippine Islands, and the Panama Canal Zone.\r\n\r\nBy the laws of Islam the soil of a conquered land is granted by God as\r\nthe absolute possession of the _Imâm_, or divinely commissioned prince,\r\nwho commands the conquering army.[40] Apart from the question as to where\r\nthe sovereignty rests, this theory of ownership is substantially that of\r\nthe modern state. The fact that the soil of the Ottoman Empire came into\r\nhighly complex relationships with the government, therefore, arose not\r\nso much from a different fundamental theory as from a greater number of\r\nspecial arrangements based on circumstances and on the personality of\r\nreligion and law.\r\n\r\nThe Ottoman Empire consisted, first, of a great body of lands which\r\nwere directly administered according to a system that was exceedingly\r\nintricate but approximately uniform; second, of a number of regions less\r\ndirectly administered under special regulations; third, of numerous\r\ntributary provinces; and fourth, of certain protected or vassal states.\r\nOutside the whole, except where the frontiers were natural, lay a belt\r\nof neutral or disputed territory, which tended to be depopulated by\r\ncontinual raids from both sides, only less frequent and terrible in time\r\nof peace than in time of war.[41] The great significance of this belt\r\nto the Ottoman people and government was that it furnished a continuous\r\nsupply of captives for the enormous slave-trade of the empire. Outside of\r\nthe raided belt, again, lay the _Dar-ul harb_, or land of war, inhabited\r\neither by peoples whose religions were regarded as inferior, or by\r\nheretics, whom it was a duty to conquer, at least when practical.[42]\r\nThe order in which these several regions are mentioned, an order based\r\non progressive diminution of control, corresponds in general to an\r\nincreasing distance from Constantinople. While the Ottoman Empire was\r\ngrowing, each sort of territory tended to absorb the next, proceeding\r\nfrom the center outward.\r\n\r\nThese lands may be considered rapidly in the reverse order. The\r\nterritory in which raiding was frequent consisted of a strip extending\r\nacross Austria-Hungary from the head of the Adriatic in a northeasterly\r\ndirection, and another band stretching eastwardly across Southern\r\nPoland and Russia in the edge of the forest region. The latter was\r\nseparated from Crimean Tartary by the steppe land, which the Tartars kept\r\nuninhabited in order to afford a free passage to their light horse. The\r\nPersian frontier also lay waste; but the country was too much broken for\r\neasy raiding, and Mohammedans, even though heretical, could not lawfully\r\nbe enslaved.[43] Similar conditions existed on the Moroccan frontier,\r\nexcept that the majority of the inhabitants of Morocco were orthodox\r\nMoslems. Another section that may properly be regarded as one of the\r\nraided regions from which slaves and booty were drawn was the Christian\r\nshipping on the Mediterranean Sea, and the islands and shores of that\r\nsea so far as they were held by Christians. Crimean Tartary, Georgia,\r\nMingrelia, and parts of Arabia were vassal territories, more or less\r\nlightly attached and paying no regular tribute.[44] Venice’s island of\r\nCyprus, the Emperor Ferdinand’s possessions in Hungary, the territories\r\nof Ragusa, Transylvania, Moldavia, and Wallachia, all paid regular\r\ntribute with occasional presents, for the privilege of maintaining their\r\nown administrations. Egypt was under a special government, adapted\r\nwith slight changes from that of the Mamelukes, headed by a pasha sent\r\nout from Constantinople for a term of three years, and delivering a\r\nlarge part of its annual revenue to the imperial treasury. The Holy\r\nCities of Mecca and Medina, far from paying tribute, received a large\r\nannual subsidy at the cost of Egypt.[45] North Africa, conquered by\r\nthe Corsairs, was brought into the empire by Khaireddin Barbarossa\r\nprincipally for the sake of prestige and support; but, though in its\r\norganization it imitated the parent government, it was seldom in close\r\nobedience.\r\n\r\nThe regions directly administered were divided into districts, or\r\n_sanjaks_, each of which had a separate law or _kanun-nameh_, of\r\ntaxation, which rested upon terms made at the time of conquest.[46]\r\nParts of the mountain lands of Albania and Kurdistan, and the desert\r\nof Arabia, though nominally under direct administration, were in very\r\nslight obedience; they retained their ancient tribal organizations, under\r\nhereditary chieftains who were invested with Ottoman titles in return\r\nfor military service, and whose followers might or might not submit to\r\ntaxation.[47] The remaining _sanjaks_, more closely under control, were\r\nyet organized in no simple way.\r\n\r\nParcels of land in the great central portion of the Ottoman Empire were\r\nin three classes,—the tithe lands (_ersi ’ushriyeh_), the tribute lands\r\n(_ersi kharâjiyeh_), and the state lands (_ersi memleket_).[48] The tithe\r\nlands had been granted to Mohammedans in fee-simple (_mulk_) at the time\r\nof conquest, on condition of paying a relatively small portion (not more\r\nthan one-tenth) of the produce to the state. The tribute lands had been\r\ngranted or left to Christians in fee-simple at the time of conquest, on\r\npayment of one of two taxes—either a fixed sum for the land itself or\r\na share of the produce—the latter ranging in amount from one-tenth to\r\none-half.[49] The state lands were such as had never been granted in\r\nfee-simple, and hence their title remained in the sultan. He received\r\nthe revenue, however, from only a part of them; for a very large portion\r\nhad been given to mosques as endowment (_vakf_) for their maintenance\r\nand the support of their attendants, or for the benefit of the schools,\r\nhospitals, and other buildings attached to them; and another large\r\nportion had been granted in fief to Mohammedans, who in return rendered\r\nmilitary service on horseback.[50] The comparatively small remainder of\r\nthe state lands was held as crown domain, administered in a special way\r\nby the sultan as owner. The tenants of state lands held title only by\r\nlease, or _tapu_, and paid both money and crop rent to the church, the\r\nfief-holder, or the crown.[51] All the lands in Europe were regarded as\r\nstate land,[52] for the Ottomans gave out in fee-simple few lands that\r\nwere conquered from Christians. Asia Minor was also largely state land;\r\nbut Syria, Mesopotamia, and Egypt were held under older arrangements,\r\nand were mainly tribute lands. Arabia and Bosra were almost wholly tithe\r\nlands, as being the oldest Arabian possessions.[53] The fundamental\r\nquality of all tribute land was unchangeable;[54] but original tithe\r\nlands which had come into the hands of Christians were temporarily\r\nregarded as tribute lands,[55] and lands in fee-simple (tithe and\r\ntribute lands) might be devoted by their owners as religious endowments\r\n(_vakf_).[56] Original small fiefs might be made into one large one; or\r\na number of persons might come to hold a fief without division of it,\r\nprovided they jointly furnished the required military service.[57] Many\r\nendowments (_vakf_) were made by private individuals for various public\r\npurposes; in time, through the attachment of pension provisions and by\r\nother devices, a system was built up which had many of the features of\r\nthe employment of uses under English law.[58]\r\n\r\nNo small amount of land of every sort went out of cultivation, and after\r\na certain time had elapsed, if the owner was unknown, became state land.\r\nIf this or any other unoccupied land was brought again under the plow, it\r\nmight be granted to the new cultivator.[59]\r\n\r\nThis rapid survey is sufficient to reveal the tangled nature of the\r\nOttoman land system in both its farther and its nearer aspects, and to\r\nshow why the administration had to become markedly and increasingly\r\nbureaucratic. Such a multiplication of relations acted powerfully toward\r\ndecentralization, since the regulation of countless details could be\r\nattended to better from points near at hand; and the immense amount of\r\nadjustment to which officials and clerks must devote their time afforded\r\ninfinite opportunities for corruption and extortion. Suleiman, in his\r\nlegislation, made a series of efforts to simplify and systematize the\r\nsituation, and with some success; but he could not remove the causes of\r\nthe complications, or arrange matters so that they would not eventually\r\nbecome worse than before.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PEOPLES\r\n\r\nThe wide Ottoman territory held a great number of peoples, marked off by\r\ndifferences of race, language, religion, and customs. The raided belt\r\nwas inhabited chiefly by Southern Slavs, Germans, Hungarians, Poles,\r\nand Russians; and the Christian shores and islands of the Mediterranean\r\nchiefly by Greeks, Italians, French, and Spaniards. Accordingly, slaves\r\nfrom all these peoples were constantly forwarded to the center and\r\ndistributed widely—in the service of the sultan, in the households of\r\nthe great, and on the estates of country gentlemen. They were treated\r\nwithout prejudice in accordance with their abilities, and in the end the\r\ngreat majority were brought into the Moslem fold, many of them rising\r\nto the highest positions. The inhabitants of the tributary states were\r\nleft in possession of most of their own institutions, but whether to\r\ntheir advantage in the long run is a question open to debate.[60] They\r\nwere plundered directly by their own princes and indirectly by the\r\nTurks, and they had almost no part in the work and life of the empire.\r\nThe Mingrelians and Georgians captured and even raised children for the\r\nslave-trade of the empire proper and of Egypt.[61] The Egyptian fellahs\r\ntoiled, as they have done through all ages, to produce wealth for their\r\nmasters, who were now in two bodies—the Mamelukes, recruited as always\r\nfrom slaves of many races, and the group of officials and Janissaries\r\nwho aided and sustained the Ottoman pasha. The Berbers of North Africa\r\nfurnished a sufficient task of government to their rulers, who consisted\r\nof a body of officials and Janissaries recruited from captives and from\r\nthe Turks and other inhabitants of southwestern Asia Minor,[62] but\r\nconnected only at the top with the central government of the empire.\r\n\r\nIn the region which was under more or less direct administration,\r\nAlbanians, Servians, Croatians, Bulgarians, and Greeks—in general,\r\nthe Christian subjects in the Balkan Peninsula—furnished most of the\r\ntribute children; but some were taken from the Christians of western and\r\nnortheastern Asia Minor and the Caucasus region.[63] Kurds and Arabs,\r\nbeing Moslems, could not be enslaved, but they fought for the empire on\r\nthe eastern frontiers. Armenians and Jews were, by ancient privilege,\r\nexempt from both blood tribute and military service.[64]\r\n\r\nThe principle of the personality of law and religion came most visibly\r\ninto play in the heart of the empire. Prevalent in the Orient from the\r\ntime of Assyria’s greatness to the present day, it is not easily to be\r\nunderstood in a land that has wholly separated religion and law. Where\r\nthese two ideas are united, two men who hold different faiths must\r\nperforce live under different laws.[65] Islam inherited the idea of the\r\npersonality of law through the Sassanian Persians, and endeavored to\r\napply it with simplicity by drawing a single line between Moslem citizens\r\n(_Muslim_) and non-Moslem subjects (_Zimmi_).[66] The Ottomans adopted\r\nthe idea unreservedly and worked it out into a complicated system: each\r\nconsiderable body of their non-Moslem subjects, Greek Orthodox, United\r\nGreek, Armenian, and Jewish, they left, in time, not merely to its own\r\nreligion, but to its own law and the administration of its law in all\r\nmatters that did not concern Moslems.[67] Proceeding yet farther with\r\nthe same principle, they granted even greater privileges to foreigners\r\nwho wished to reside within the empire. Except for a tax upon the land\r\nwhich they might occupy, for the necessity of paying customs duties, and\r\nfor responsibility to Ottoman courts of justice in civil cases in which\r\nOttoman subjects were concerned, such foreigners were almost wholly free\r\nfrom Ottoman control, freer far to do as they pleased than they could be\r\nin their native lands.\r\n\r\nRegions existed where nearly all the inhabitants obeyed one law. In\r\nBulgaria and Greece few were not Greek Orthodox. In the interior of\r\nAsia Minor few were not, at least legally, Mohammedan. But in the great\r\ncities of the empire, and especially in the capital, there was an immense\r\nvariety of obedience. Not only did the various colonies of foreigners\r\nand the various subject nationalities have their separate rights under\r\ndifferent systems, but individuals among them, such as ambassadors\r\nand clergymen, had special privileges and immunities. Even among the\r\nMohammedans there were various distinctions. Several large classes were\r\nprivileged, and in different ways, including all the people of court and\r\nchurch, of the army and the law, of government and education. The social\r\nand legal structure was thus scarcely less complicated than that of\r\nmedieval Western Europe, with its interlocking of feudal and official and\r\nroyal privilege, of clergy and nobility, of free and chartered cities.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTITUTIONS OF GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nIn the midst of so much territorial complexity and among so many peoples\r\nwhich enjoyed different rights, what unifying institutions did the\r\nOttoman Empire possess? In the largest sense, the government included\r\nevery organization that could lay claim to any public character, and\r\nall of these must be brought into view if there is to be a complete\r\nunderstanding of the conditions. In the first place, however, it is\r\nnecessary to discover and comprehend the genuinely great and powerful\r\ninstitutions. These were two, and not, as is essential to the modern\r\nconception of the state, a single one. Each was, it is true, composed\r\nof several parts, which may be regarded as distinct institutions in\r\nthemselves; and yet each had an inherent unity that must be firmly\r\ngrasped and held if the situation is to be understood.\r\n\r\nIf names must be assigned to these two great composite institutions, the\r\nnearest approximation would perhaps be to call them State and Church.\r\nBut these words give no adequate idea of them, since each embraced\r\na little less and at the same time far more than is included in the\r\nconception of the corresponding Western institutions. They will therefore\r\nbe described and discussed as the “Ottoman Ruling Institution,” and the\r\n“Moslem Institution of the Ottoman Empire.” The character of each and\r\nthe distinction between them will become clear as they are explained in\r\ndetail. For the present, a brief statement of the composition of each and\r\nof its function in the government of the empire will suffice.\r\n\r\nThe Ottoman Ruling Institution included the sultan and his family, the\r\nofficers of his household, the executive officers of the government,\r\nthe standing army composed of cavalry and infantry, and a large body of\r\nyoung men who were being educated for service in the standing army, the\r\ncourt, and the government. These men wielded the sword, the pen, and\r\nthe scepter. They conducted the whole of the government except the mere\r\nrendering of justice in matters that were controlled by the Sacred Law,\r\nand those limited functions that were left in the hands of subject and\r\nforeign groups of non-Moslems. The most vital and characteristic features\r\nof this institution were, first, that its personnel consisted, with few\r\nexceptions, of men born of Christian parents or of the sons of such; and,\r\nsecond, that almost every member of the Institution came into it as the\r\nsultan’s slave, and remained the sultan’s slave throughout life no matter\r\nto what height of wealth, power, and greatness he might attain.\r\n\r\nThe Moslem Institution of the Ottoman Empire included the educators,\r\npriests, jurisconsults, and judges of the empire, and all who were\r\nin training for such duties, besides certain allied groups, such as\r\ndervishes or monks, and emirs or descendants of the Prophet Mohammed.\r\nThese men embodied and maintained the whole substance and structure\r\nof Mohammedan learning, religion, and law in the empire. They took\r\npart in the government by applying the Sacred Law as judges assisted\r\nby jurisconsults, and in these capacities they paralleled the entire\r\nstructure of administration to the remotest corner of the empire.[68] In\r\nfact, their system extended to regions where direct administration was\r\nnot exercised. In the Crimea, for example, the rendering of justice was\r\nin their hands, while the other functions of government were performed by\r\na vassal state in light obedience. The situation in Arabia and in North\r\nAfrica was somewhat similar, though complicated by the presence of rival\r\nsystems of jurisprudence. In direct contrast to the Ruling Institution,\r\nthe personnel of the Moslem Institution consisted, with hardly an\r\nexception, of men born of Moslem parents, and born and brought up free.\r\n\r\nBoth these institutions, while uniquely powerful and independent within\r\nthe empire, were paralleled by lesser institutions, but in different\r\nways. The Ruling Institution was followed closely by the governments of\r\nEgypt and North Africa, and less closely by those of the tributary and\r\nvassal states; but all these were strictly subordinate, and exercised\r\nwhat authority they possessed only within definite territorial limits.\r\nThe Moslem Institution was followed closely by the Greek and Armenian\r\nand Jewish national institutions, and to some extent by the organization\r\nof the foreign colonies. Each of these various institutions rested on\r\na religious organization or theory, cared for the learning, religion,\r\nand law of its people, and rendered justice in matters not covered by\r\nthe Ottoman administration; but all were wholly independent of the\r\nMoslem Institution, and, since they were based on personality instead\r\nof territory, they exercised jurisdictions which were territorially\r\nco-extensive with its jurisdiction and often with the jurisdictions of\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nThe two great institutions and the lesser parallel ones included\r\npractically all the government of the empire when regarded in its widest\r\naspect. In the time of Suleiman the Ruling Institution was perhaps of\r\ngreater power and influence than the Moslem Institution, but the tendency\r\nof the latter was to gain upon the former. Notable progress in that\r\ndirection was made during his reign, and indeed through his personality.\r\nThe policy of both toward the parallel lesser institutions was to prevent\r\nthem from gaining in power, and, so far as possible, to weaken them.\r\nIn the former aim this policy succeeded with all but two classes,—the\r\ngovernments of North Africa, which were separated by a sea under their\r\nown control, and the organizations of the foreign settlements, which were\r\nsupported by active and increasing powers outside of the empire. But the\r\ntwo great institutions were restrained by circumstances and their own\r\ninherent structure from extirpating the parallel institutions, and in\r\ntime they were to cease to weaken them. The greatest dangers to the whole\r\nOttoman system lay, however, in the rivalry of the two great institutions\r\nand in a tendency of the Ruling Institution toward decentralization and\r\ndivision into its component parts.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTEMPORARY DESCRIPTIONS OF THE TWO GREAT INSTITUTIONS\r\n\r\nFew writers on the history and government of the Ottoman Empire since the\r\nsixteenth century have grasped the individual unity, the parallelism,\r\nand the contrast of its two leading institutions. D’Ohsson and Von\r\nHammer understood the Moslem Institution, but missed the conception of\r\nthe Ruling Institution, the unity of which had disappeared long before\r\ntheir time. Ranke obtained from a few of the Italian writers a very vivid\r\nconception of the Ruling Institution, particularly as a slave-family and\r\nan army; but he did not see the Moslem Institution in its due proportion\r\nand importance. Zinkeisen, making wider use of the Italians, came nearer\r\nthan any other to a clear understanding of the whole scheme; yet his\r\nexposition does not leave a distinct impression. Bury, in his lucid\r\nchapter in the _Cambridge Modern History_, describes well the _Spahis_\r\nand the Janissaries, and notes that many tribute children rose to high\r\npositions; but he does not grasp the unity of the Ruling Institution,\r\nand he seems hardly at all to see the Moslem Institution. Jorga, the\r\nlatest to write a general history of Turkey, makes it his avowed purpose\r\nto exhibit cultural and institutional growth; he comes near, but does\r\nnot attain, a distinct conception of the Ruling Institution; while\r\ngiving especial attention to the renegades who reached high position in\r\nthe fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, he seems not to recognize how\r\ndefinite, and how intelligently constructed and directed, were the policy\r\nand organization which raised them to power.[69]\r\n\r\nIn order to show how clearly some of the Italian writers of the sixteenth\r\ncentury understood the two institutions, though not under any particular\r\nnames, translations of certain quotations are subjoined. Since they will\r\nserve also to justify the present writer’s point of view, no apology need\r\nbe made for their length.\r\n\r\nAndrea Gritti, Venetian orator extraordinary to Bayezid II, in his report\r\nto the Venetian senate on December 2, 1503, mentions the highest Turkish\r\nofficials as follows:—“For affairs of state and every other matter of\r\nimportance His Majesty is wont to take counsel with the pashas.... These\r\nare ordinarily four in number, who reside in Constantinople; they are\r\nborn of Christian parents, seized from the provinces while small, and\r\neducated in different places by men delegated for that purpose; raised\r\nthen to certain positions either through the affection which the Grand\r\nSignor bears for them, or by some enterprises valorously carried through,\r\nthey quickly become very rich, selling, among matters of importance,\r\njustice and favors; but when they find themselves at the summit of\r\nfelicity they live in great danger.”[70]\r\n\r\nAntonio Barbarigo, Venetian _Bailo_ at Constantinople from 1555 to 1560,\r\nspeaks further of the high officials: “Nor does there exist in this so\r\ngreat empire either superiority or illustriousness of blood, so that any\r\none can glory in his descent, but all are in an equal condition, and\r\nthey themselves wish to be named and called slaves of the Grand Signor,\r\nand their greatest pride is when they say that they are slaves of the\r\nSignor; and all his chief men and governors are slaves, and Christian\r\nrenegades, and sons of Christians brought up from an early age in the\r\nseraglio, and then in time, according to their worth, exalted and\r\nrewarded and made great by His Majesty.”[71]\r\n\r\nMarcantonio Barbaro, _Bailo_ of Venice at Constantinople from 1568 to\r\n1573, seems to have been the first to discern clearly the contrast of the\r\ntwo institutions.\r\n\r\n“It is a fact truly worthy of much consideration, that the riches, the\r\nforces, the government, and in short the whole state of the Ottoman\r\nEmpire is founded upon and placed in the hands of persons all born\r\nin the faith of Christ; who by different methods are made slaves and\r\ntransferred into the Mohammedan sect. Then whoever will carefully direct\r\nhis attention to this principal consideration, will come more easily to\r\nan understanding of the government and nature of the Turks....\r\n\r\n“Other sorts of persons are not ordinarily admitted to the honors\r\nand the pay of the Grand Signor, except the above-mentioned, all\r\nChristian-born....\r\n\r\n“The emperor of the Turks has ordinarily no other ordinances and no\r\nother laws which regulate justice, the state, and religion, than the\r\nKoran; so that, as the arms and the forces are wholly reposed in the\r\nhands of persons all born Christians, so, as I have already said, the\r\nadministration of the laws is all solely in the hands of those who are\r\nborn Turks, who bring up their sons in the service of the mosques, where\r\nthey learn the Koran, until being come of age they are made _kazis_ of\r\nthe land, who are like our _podestas_, and administer justice, although\r\nthe execution remains in the hands of those who wield arms....\r\n\r\n“I have taken much space to demonstrate to your most excellent Signory\r\nhow the government of this empire is wholly reposed in the hands\r\nof slaves born Christians, this appearing to me a matter for much\r\nconsideration....”[72]\r\n\r\nGianfrancesco Morosini, Venetian _Bailo_ at Constantinople from 1582 to\r\n1585, later made a cardinal of the Roman church, yields to none in the\r\nfulness and depth of his observation of the Turks. He too distinguishes\r\nclearly the great institutions:—\r\n\r\n“There are two sorts of Turks: one of these is composed of natives born\r\nof Turkish fathers, and the other of renegades, who are sons of Christian\r\nfathers, taken violently in the depredations which his fleets and sailors\r\nare accustomed to make on Christian territories, or levied in his own\r\nterritory by force of hand from the subjects and non-Moslem tax-payers\r\n(_carzeri_) of the Signor, who while boys are by allurement or by force\r\ncircumcised and made Turks.... Not only does the greater part of the\r\nsoldiery of the Turks consist of these renegades, but in yet greater\r\nproportion all the principal offices of the Porte are wont to be given\r\nto them, from the grand vizier to the lowest chief of this soldiery, it\r\nbeing established by ancient custom that the sons of Turks cannot have\r\nthese positions....\r\n\r\n“To the native Turks are reserved then the governing of the mosques, the\r\njudging of civil and criminal cases, and the office of the chancery: from\r\nthese are taken the _kazis_ and the _kaziaskers_, the teachers (_hojas_),\r\nand their _Mufti_, who is the head of their false religion; and the\r\n_kazis_ are like podestas, and render justice to every one, and the\r\n_kaziaskers_ are like judges of appeal from these _kazis_....”\r\n\r\n“The renegades are all slaves and take great pride in being able to\r\nsay, ‘I am a slave of the Grand Signor’; since they know that this is a\r\nlordship or a republic of slaves, where it is theirs to command.”[73]\r\n\r\nLorenzo Bernardo was _Bailo_ of Venice in Constantinople from 1584 to\r\n1587. After a second period of service in 1591 and 1592 he presented the\r\nlongest extant report to the Venetian senate on the Ottoman Empire. After\r\ndescribing the principal officers of the Ottoman government at the time\r\nhe says in his involved style:—\r\n\r\n“These are they, in whom is reposed not only the whole government of the\r\nstate, but also the command of all the arms of this so great an empire;\r\nand yet these are neither dukes, nor marquises, nor counts, but all by\r\norigin are shepherds, and persons base and vile; wherefore it would be\r\nwell if this most serene republic, imitating in this direction the Grand\r\nSignor, he who from this sort of persons, his slaves, creates and makes\r\nthe best captains, _sanjaks_ and _beylerbeys_, giving them in this way\r\ncredit and reputation....\r\n\r\n“Just as the whole government of the affairs of the state and the command\r\nof its arms is reposed in the hands or the control of slaves by origin\r\nChristian, and then made Turks by various accidents; so the government\r\nof the affairs which look toward justice, and all the charge of affairs\r\nof religion are located in the hands of native Turks, sons of Turks, who\r\nhaving been educated in the universities instituted by the Grand Signor\r\nand the present ministers, and made learned in their laws, which consist,\r\nboth civil and criminal, in no other teaching than that of the sole book,\r\nthe Koran, become _imâms_, or priests, who govern mosques; _kazis_, or\r\npodestas; _hojas_, or preceptors of great men; and finally _kaziaskers_,\r\nor judges of supreme appeal, of whom there are only two, the one in Asia\r\nand the other in Europe; and the head of all these and supreme in their\r\nreligion is the _mufti_, like the pope among us, who is chosen by the\r\nGrand Signor.”[74]\r\n\r\nLastly, Matteo Zane shall speak, Venetian _Bailo_ in Constantinople\r\nfrom 1591 to 1597. In the imperfect record of his vigorous report,\r\nthe illustrious diplomatist says: “The Turks are partly natives and\r\npartly renegades; the natives, who live for the most part in Asia, are\r\nin comparison with the renegades less depraved and less tyrannous,\r\nbecause they still have in them some religion, which the others have\r\nnot,—the most arrogant and scoundrelly men that can be imagined, having\r\nseemingly with the true faith lost all humanity. This alienation from\r\nreligion is fitting in desperate characters, who are induced to it by\r\nlicentious freedom of life, and by seeing placed in their hands the arms,\r\nthe government, the riches, and in short the whole empire, excluding\r\nthe native Turks, who are admitted only to the careers of justice, as\r\nthat of _kazi_ and the like, and to those of religion, such as _mufti_,\r\n_hoja_, and _imâm_, as is very well known.”[75]\r\n\r\nThe impending break-down of the system near the close of the sixteenth\r\ncentury is also set forth clearly by Zane: “The government of the Turkish\r\nEmpire is suffering within itself so many and such great alterations,\r\nthat one may very reasonably hope, divine aid mediating, for some notable\r\nrevolution within a short time, because the native Turks continue to\r\nsustain the greatest dissatisfaction, from seeing all the confidence\r\nof the government reposed in the renegades, who, at a tender age for\r\nthe most part, are taken into the seraglio of the king or of private\r\ncitizens, and made Turks. To the renegades is committed not merely the\r\ncare of arms, but the entire command and the execution of the acts\r\nof justice of the _kazis_ (although they do not allow appeals), and\r\nthe superintendence of religion; whence one may say that they rule\r\neverything and that the native Turks are their subjects as are servants\r\nto their masters; which was not true in other times to such excess as at\r\npresent.”[76]\r\n\r\nTo these testimonies from Italian writers may be added a paragraph\r\nwritten about 1603 by the great English historian of Turkey, Richard\r\nKnolles. Knolles shows no acquaintance with the Moslem Institution, but\r\nhis recognition of the Ruling Institution is good:—\r\n\r\n“The _Othoman_ Government in this his so great an Empire, is altogether\r\nlike the Government of the Master over his Slave, and indeed meer\r\ntyrannical; for the Great Sultan is so absolute a Lord of all things\r\nwithin the compass of his Empire, that all his Subjects and People, be\r\nthey never so great, do call themselves his Slaves and not his Subjects;\r\nneither hath any man power over himself, much less is he Lord of the\r\nHouse wherein he dwelleth, or of the Land which he tilleth, except some\r\nfew Families in _Constantinople_, to whom some few such things were by\r\nway of reward, and upon especial favour given by _Mahomet_ the Second, at\r\nsuch time as he won the same. Neither is any man in that Empire so great,\r\nor yet so far in favour with the Great Sultan, as that he can assure\r\nhimself of his Life, much less of his present Fortune or State, longer\r\nthan it pleaseth the Sultan. In which so absolute a Sovereignty (by any\r\nfree born People not to be endured) the Tyrant preserveth himself by\r\ntwo most especial means; first, by taking off all Arms from his natural\r\nSubjects; and then by putting the same and all things else concerning the\r\nState and Government thereof into the Hands of the Apostata, or Renegade\r\nChristians, whom for the most part every third, fourth, or fifth Year\r\n(or oftner, if his need so require) he taketh in their Child-hood, from\r\ntheir miserable Parents, as his Tenths or Tribute Children; whereby he\r\ngaineth two great Commodities: First, For that in so doing he spoileth\r\nthe Provinces he most feareth, of the flower, sinews, and strength of\r\nthe People, choice being still made of the strongest Youths, and fittest\r\nfor War; then, for that with these, as with his own Creatures, he armeth\r\nhimself, and by them assureth his State; for they, in their Child-hood,\r\ntaken from their Parents Laps, and delivered in Charge to one or other\r\nappointed for that purpose, quickly, and before they are aware, become\r\nMahometans; and so no more acknowledging Father or Mother, depend wholly\r\non the Great Sultan; who, to make use of them, both feeds them and\r\nfosters them, at whose hands onely they look for all things, and whom\r\nalone they thank for all. Of which Fry, so taken from their Christian\r\nParents (the only Seminary of his Wars) some become Horse-men, some\r\nFoot-men, and so in time the greatest Commanders of his State and Empire,\r\nnext unto himself; the natural Turks, in the mean time, giving themselves\r\nwholly unto the Trade of Merchandise, and other their Mechanical\r\nOccupations; or else to the feeding of Cattel, their most ancient and\r\nnatural Vocation, not intermedling at all with matters of Government or\r\nState.”[77]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE OTTOMAN RULING INSTITUTION: AS A SLAVE-FAMILY\r\n\r\n\r\nI. GENERAL DESCRIPTION\r\n\r\nPerhaps no more daring experiment has been tried on a large scale\r\nupon the face of the earth than that embodied in the Ottoman Ruling\r\nInstitution. Its nearest ideal analogue is found in the Republic of\r\nPlato, its nearest actual parallel in the Mameluke system of Egypt;\r\nbut it was not restrained within the aristocratic Hellenic limitations\r\nof the first, and it subdued and outlived the second. In the United\r\nStates of America men have risen from the rude work of the backwoods\r\nto the presidential chair, but they have done so by their own effort\r\nand not through the gradations of a system carefully organized to push\r\nthem forward. The Roman Catholic church can still train a peasant to\r\nbecome a pope, but it has never begun by choosing its candidates almost\r\nexclusively from families which profess a hostile religion. The Ottoman\r\nsystem deliberately took slaves and made them ministers of state; it took\r\nboys from the sheep-run and the plow-tail and made them courtiers and\r\nthe husbands of princesses; it took young men whose ancestors had borne\r\nthe Christian name for centuries, and made them rulers in the greatest\r\nof Mohammedan states, and soldiers and generals in invincible armies\r\nwhose chief joy was to beat down the Cross and elevate the Crescent. It\r\nnever asked its novices, “Who was your father?” or “What do you know?” or\r\neven “Can you speak our tongue?”; but it studied their faces and their\r\nframes and said, “_You_ shall be a soldier, and if you show yourself\r\nworthy, a general,” or, “_You_ shall be a scholar and a gentleman, and\r\nif the ability lies in you, a governor and a prime minister.” Grandly\r\ndisregarding that fabric of fundamental customs which is called “human\r\nnature,” and those religious and social prejudices which are thought\r\nto be almost as deep as life itself, the Ottoman system took children\r\nforever from parents, discouraged family cares among its members through\r\ntheir most active years, allowed them no certain hold on property, gave\r\nthem no definite promise that their sons and daughters would profit by\r\ntheir success and sacrifice, raised and lowered them with no regard for\r\nancestry or previous distinction, taught them a strange law, ethics, and\r\nreligion, and ever kept them conscious of a sword raised above their\r\nheads which might put an end at any moment to a brilliant career along a\r\nmatchless path of human glory.\r\n\r\nThe members of this system were, in a general way, as long as they lived,\r\nat once slaves, proselytes, students, soldiers, nobles, courtiers, and\r\nofficers of government. To be understood fully, the institution should\r\nbe considered from each of these points of view. The aspects which were\r\nof central and controlling importance, however, were those of war and\r\ngovernment; the others were preparatory or accessory. Furthermore, the\r\nsultan was the head and center of the institution in every one of its\r\naspects. He gave it its unity, its vigor, and its propelling force.\r\nAlthough his despotic power was limited in many directions, it knew no\r\nlimits with regard to the members and the mechanism of this institution.\r\nThe person, the fortune, the property, and the life of every member lay\r\nin his hand.[78]\r\n\r\nThe absolute character of the sultan’s authority was an element of great\r\nstrength to the institution, but it contained also the possibility of a\r\ngreat danger. To manage the system well required an almost superhuman\r\nintelligence. The sultan held the position of Deity toward his slaves,\r\nand he needed the omniscience and benevolence of Deity to exercise his\r\npower wisely and justly. Unfortunately, his position, which controlled\r\nthe whole scheme, was the only one that was filled by the uncertain lot\r\nof heredity. While strong men came to the throne, the system worked out\r\nmarvellous results. When weak men were to come, as happened immediately\r\nafter Suleiman, the system was to begin to fall apart into dangerous\r\nfragments. Yet its vitality was so strong that it lived on through\r\nnearly three centuries of alternate decline and rehabilitation, and its\r\nspirit may almost be said to abide still.\r\n\r\nThe Ruling Institution contained certain component parts, which were\r\ncapable of separate existence, and some of which at times tended\r\nto escape complete control. Among these the best-known, though not\r\nintrinsically the most important, was the body of permanent infantry\r\nknown as the Janissaries. They represented the brute force of the system\r\nand its most dangerous element. Another component institution was the\r\npermanent cavalry, the _Spahis_ of the Porte.[79] These were more\r\nnumerous than the Janissaries, but being better educated and encouraged\r\nby the presence of greater opportunities, they were not so dangerous. A\r\nthird important sub-institution was the hierarchy of governing officials.\r\nAlthough these had great power, they could be dealt with individually;\r\nand the sword was never far from their necks. Subordinate bodies of a\r\nsecondary influence were the _Ajem-oghlans_, or apprentice Janissaries,\r\nand the colleges of pages, which trained many of the _Spahis_ of the\r\nPorte and most of the officers of government. Each of these component\r\nparts will be dealt with in its proper place. Theoretically, and except\r\nat certain junctures practically, they were strictly subordinated to\r\nthe main institution and yet fully incorporated with it. The Ruling\r\nInstitution as a whole will be considered as a slave-family, a missionary\r\ninstitution, an educational system, an army, a court, a nobility, and a\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE SLAVE-FAMILY\r\n\r\nEvery one who belonged to the Ruling Institution in any capacity from\r\ngardener to grand vizier, save only the members of the royal family, bore\r\nthe title of _kul_, or slave, of the sultan.[80] Nor was this title a\r\nmere form: with few exceptions, all members entered the system as actual\r\nslaves, and there was nowhere along the line of promotion any formal or\r\nreal process of emancipation. The power of the sultan over the lives,\r\npersons, and property of the members of the institution, and his right\r\nto their absolute obedience, bear every mark of having been derived from\r\nthe idea of slavery. The very word despot means by derivation the master\r\nof slaves, and it was only over his _kullar_ that the sultan’s power was\r\ndespotic in the fullest sense.[81]\r\n\r\nEntrance to the system came by the door of slavery, which was open\r\nregularly only to Christian boys from ten to twenty years of age. It\r\nis an error, found in some writers even lately, to name eight years as\r\nthe usual age.[82] The correct limits are given approximately by many\r\ncontemporary writers.[83] It is probable that the preferred ages were\r\nbetween fourteen and eighteen, and that only in exceptional cases were\r\nboys taken before the age of twelve or after the age of twenty.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF RECRUITING\r\n\r\nFour methods were employed for obtaining recruits for the system,—by\r\ncapture, purchase, gift, and tribute. Of these only the last is commonly\r\nconsidered;[84] but it was originally, and probably always, merely\r\nsupplementary to the others.[85] The four methods ultimately rested on\r\ntwo. Slaves who were bought for the sultan or given to him had nearly\r\nall been either taken as captives or levied illegally with the tribute\r\nboys; there was hardly any other way, since slaves passed too rapidly\r\ninto the Moslem fold to have their children available for the system. As\r\nto the comparative numbers obtained by the different methods there are\r\nfew data for calculation. Probably about three thousand tribute boys was\r\nthe annual average in the sixteenth century,[86] but there is no reason\r\nto think that this was a majority in the number of annual recruits. The\r\nwhole number in the system may be estimated at about eighty thousand.[87]\r\nSince the losses by war were sometimes tremendous, it is probable that\r\nthe average annual renewal required was as much as one-tenth, or between\r\nseven and eight thousand. On this basis the tribute boys furnished\r\nsomewhat less than one-half of the whole number. These calculations are,\r\nof course, more or less arbitrary.\r\n\r\nIt is true that children of _Spahis_ of the Porte might be admitted\r\nto the college of pages at the pleasure of the sultan, but their\r\ngrandchildren and the children of all other Moslems were excluded by\r\nrigid rules.[88] These rules began to be invaded about the close of\r\nSuleiman’s reign by the admission of the sons of Janissaries,[89] an\r\ninnovation that was of ultimately fatal import to the system. A certain\r\nnumber of adults were also received and some of these were sons of\r\nMoslems; exceptional individuals from among the irregular troops were\r\nadmitted to the _Spahis_ of the Porte by way of reward,[90] and that body\r\ncontained a Foreign Legion of about two thousand, composed of renegade\r\nChristians, Arabs, Nubians, and the like.[91] Occasionally, also, some\r\nhigh official of Suleiman’s government had been born a Moslem.[92] But\r\nthe total effect of all these exceptions was so slight as to cause them\r\nto be disregarded by more than one contemporary observer.[93]\r\n\r\nThe original homes of the captives have been described.[94] By the\r\nSacred Law the sultan was entitled to one-fifth of all captives taken in\r\nwar;[95] and he chose as his share, through agents, such young men as\r\nseemed suitable for a place in his system.[96] Since by special Ottoman\r\nregulation the sultan’s fifth belonged to the church, he was accustomed\r\nto pay twenty-five aspers to the church for each slave that he took.[97]\r\nHis officers also purchased in the public slave-market of the capital\r\nsuch youths as were available.[98] These came from the captives that the\r\nTartars of the Crimea took in great numbers, from the quasi-slave-farms\r\nof the Caucasus,[99] from the irregular raids in Austria, and from the\r\ncorsair expeditions. The sultan received a large number of boys as gifts,\r\nsince it was well known that no presents were more acceptable.[100] Those\r\nwho desired his favor kept a lookout for such as would please him.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRIBUTE BOYS\r\n\r\nAlthough the levying of tribute boys in the Christian provinces of the\r\nempire seems not to have produced the majority of neophytes for the\r\nsystem, the practice has always received a share of attention far beyond\r\nits numerical importance. Several reasons for this suggest themselves.\r\nIn the first place, it rested on a unique and almost unparalleled idea;\r\nthen, it involved an extraordinary disregard of human affection and of\r\nthe generally acknowledged right of parents to bring up their children\r\nin their own law and religion;[101] and, finally, it produced the ablest\r\nand highest officials of the system.[102] In the latter respect its youth\r\nseem to have borne some such relation to those obtained by capture as the\r\ncultivated fruits of the garden do to those gathered in the woods.\r\n\r\nThe levying was accomplished by a regular process, the _devshurmeh_.\r\nNormally every four years, but oftener in case of need,[103] a body\r\nof officials more skilled in judging boys than trained horse-dealers\r\nare in judging colts were sent out by the government to the regions\r\nfrom which tribute was taken.[104] The whole of the Balkan Peninsula,\r\nHungary, the western coast of Asia Minor, and the southern and eastern\r\nshores of the Black Sea were included in the territory visited; but the\r\nstrongest and ablest youths came from the mountain regions inhabited by\r\nAlbanians and the Southern Slavic peoples.[105] The recruiting officers\r\nwere commissioned each to bring in a certain number, which had been\r\napportioned to them out of a total determined at the capital.[106] There\r\nwas no principle of tithing, and no fixed proportion or number of boys\r\nwas levied from each village or family;[107] the quota desired from\r\neach district was obtained for the government by selection of the most\r\navailable youths. The recruiting officers sometimes collected a larger\r\nnumber than was asked for, and sold the surplus on their own account to\r\nhigh officials or wealthy private citizens.[108] A regular procedure was\r\nfollowed. The officers obtained from the Christian priest of the village\r\na list of the boys whom he had baptized, and who were between the ages\r\nof twelve and twenty years or thereabouts.[109] All these were brought\r\nbefore the officers, who selected the best.[110] Parents who had strong\r\nand well-favored sons might lose them all, while those who had weaklings\r\nwould lose none.[111] On leaving each village, the officer took with him\r\nthe boys whom he had selected; and, when his quota had been gathered, he\r\ntook them to the capital.[112]\r\n\r\n\r\nESTIMATE OF THE SYSTEM\r\n\r\nThis levying of boys as tribute has always elicited a great amount\r\nof moral indignation, as representing an extreme of oppression,\r\nheartlessness, and cruelty. The religious factor has increased the odium\r\nof the custom. Certainly no argument can be found which will justify it\r\nto those who believe in the liberty of the individual, the absolute right\r\nof parents over minor children, and a complete withdrawal of human beings\r\nfrom the category of property,—principles which seem in the sixteenth\r\ncentury to have had no place in Ottoman philosophy or jurisprudence, at\r\nleast as regards Christian subjects. It may be said at once that the\r\ncustom cannot be brought into harmony with Western ideas. So much being\r\ngranted, how did the system bear upon the parents who were despoiled and\r\nthe boys who were taken?\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the conflicting testimony of reputable witnesses, it is\r\nevident that the parents of tribute boys did not all feel alike. The\r\ngrief at parting was often a heart-breaking thing to witness;[113] the\r\nmother whose son was taken by force to an unknown life among enemies of\r\nall that she had been taught to hold dear would hardly have suffered more\r\nat the death of her son. At the same time, she might hope to see him one\r\nday in the possession of great wealth and power. It is not to be supposed\r\nthat youth taken at from twelve to twenty years of age would ever forget\r\ntheir parents; and, if they lived and prospered, they would sometimes\r\nseek them out, as did Ibrahim, even though they might not try his\r\nunfortunate experiment of bringing them up to the capital.[114] Fathers\r\nwould appreciate the opportunities which arose before their sons much\r\nmore than would the mothers. Both would be more or less reluctant to let\r\nthem go, according as their Christian religious convictions were deep or\r\nshallow. Parents who wished to keep their sons would sometimes marry them\r\nin tender years, since married boys were ineligible; those who had means\r\nbought exemption for their sons from the recruiting officers, who thus\r\nreaped great rewards.[115] On the contrary, many parents were glad to\r\nhave their sons chosen, knowing that they would thus escape from grinding\r\npoverty,[116] receive a first-rate training suited to their abilities,\r\nand enter upon the possibility of a great career. Some parents, in fact,\r\ncame to regard the process as a privilege rather than a burden;[117]\r\nand they had reason to do so, since Turkish parents envied them the\r\nopportunity, and sometimes tried to evade the regulations by paying\r\nChristians to take their Moslem sons, and declare them as Christian\r\nchildren, so that they might be enrolled as the sultan’s slaves.[118]\r\nApart, then, from political theory and religious prepossession, the\r\nlevying of tribute children was by no means a mere evil to the parents.\r\n\r\nThe situation of the boys themselves, considered under the same\r\nreservations, was almost wholly favorable. They were taken at an age when\r\nthey would not feel the parting as they might have felt it in earlier\r\nor later years, when their attachment to things and places would be at\r\nits weakest, and before their religious convictions were likely to have\r\nbecome fixed. They were taken from the narrow mountain valleys and the\r\nlabor-hungry plains. They were taken at the age when the bounding pulse\r\nand the increasing strength of youth suggests great hope and promises\r\ngreat achievement. They were taken to opportunities as great as their\r\nutmost abilities, greater often than they could possibly imagine. They\r\nmight still have to labor for a time, but a distinct career lay ahead.\r\nThe best military education in the world would certainly be theirs.\r\nIf their abilities lay in that direction they could have a finished\r\nand thorough, though specialized, education of the mind. They could\r\nlook forward to travel, wealth, power, and all else that human ambition\r\ndesires. In that land and that age of the world, the question of the\r\nreligious and social systems being laid aside, an unprejudiced observer\r\ncould hardly imagine a more brilliant opportunity than that which lay\r\nbefore the tribute boys.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SLAVE STATUS\r\n\r\nWhether captured, purchased, presented, or levied, the young men who\r\nentered the system were the slaves of the sultan, the personal property\r\nof a despot. They were his slaves for life, and, though they felt honored\r\nby the title,[119] they were never allowed to forget the responsibilities\r\nof their condition. They must to the end of their days go where the\r\nsultan chose to send them, obey his slightest wish, submit to disgrace as\r\nreadily as to promotion,[120] and, though in the highest office of state,\r\nthey must accept death by his order from the hands of their humblest\r\nfellow-slaves.[121] If one of them was executed, all his property went\r\nto his master. The time had not yet come when heads would be removed for\r\nthe sake of the owner’s possessions; yet Suleiman profited greatly by the\r\ndeath of several of his slaves, in particular from the estates of the\r\n_Defterdar_ Iskender Chelebi and the grand vizier Ibrahim.[122] When one\r\nof the sultan’s slaves died leaving sons or daughters, the master sealed\r\nup his property, and took the tenth part for himself before distributing\r\nthe rest to the children;[123] the nine-tenths was, indeed, given to the\r\nchildren rather by the favor of a bountiful and wealthy master than as a\r\nright. If the slave had no sons or daughters, the sultan took his whole\r\nestate;[124] and a day was to come when his empty treasury would demand\r\nthe whole estate under all circumstances.[125] Thus in all essential\r\nrespects the eighty thousand _kullar_ of the sultan constituted one great\r\nslave-family.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HAREM, THE EUNUCHS, AND THE ROYAL FAMILY\r\n\r\nTwo or three less numerous but highly important groups may properly be\r\ndiscussed in the present connection. The imperial harem and the imperial\r\nfamily itself were virtually parts of the same slave system.[126] The\r\nharem of Suleiman was not the large and costly institution that was\r\nmaintained by some of his successors; like his father Selim,[127] he was\r\nnot given to sensuality, but is said to have been faithful to Khurrem\r\nfrom the time that he made her his wife.[128] The character of an\r\nOriental royal harem has often been set forth incorrectly. While it may\r\ncontain hundreds or even thousands of women, a very few of these are the\r\nactual consorts of the monarch. A large number are the personal servants\r\nand entertainers of himself, his mother, his consorts, his daughters, and\r\nhis infant sons. Another section consists of those who are being educated\r\nfor the same personal service. A fourth group, probably the great\r\nmajority, are mere house-servants, who attend to all the domestic labors\r\nof the harem and are seldom promoted to more honorable positions. There\r\nis, finally, a group of older women who preserve order and peace, teach,\r\nkeep accounts, and manage the establishment generally.[129]\r\n\r\nSuleiman’s harem contained about three hundred women, who were kept in a\r\nseparate palace well fortified and guarded.[130] His harem fully deserves\r\nto be reckoned as part of the great slave-family, since all its inmates\r\nexcept his children were purchased or presented slaves.[131] These\r\nwomen, brought for the most part from the region of the Caucasus,[132]\r\nand including in their number some of the fairest female captives of\r\nmany lands, were nearly all daughters of Christians. Khurrem herself\r\nwas a Russian, while the rival of her youth seems to have been a\r\nCircassian.[133] In another respect the harem deserves to be reckoned\r\nwith the Ruling Institution, in that its inmates, upon attaining the age\r\nof twenty-five, were, if they had not attracted the sultan’s special\r\nattention, as a rule given in marriage to distinguished _Spahis_ of the\r\nPorte.[134]\r\n\r\nA comparatively small group, not hitherto mentioned, of the attendants at\r\nthe sultan’s palace and harem belong within the slave-family. Although\r\nthe Sacred Law strongly disapproved of the employment of eunuchs, that\r\nunfortunate class was thought too useful to be dispensed with entirely.\r\nSome were white, brought mainly from the Caucasus region; but the great\r\nmajority were negroes brought from Africa. Tribute children seem rarely\r\nto have been made eunuchs.[135] The class deserves mention because\r\nseveral of the important offices of state among the “men of the pen” were\r\nheld by eunuchs, and now and then one rose to high place in the army or\r\nthe administration.[136]\r\n\r\nThe royal family also may rightly be included in the slave-family. The\r\nmothers of the sultan’s children were slaves; the sultan himself was the\r\nson of a slave; and his daughters were married to men, who, though they\r\nmight be called vizier and pasha, wore these titles at the sultan’s\r\npleasure, whereas they bore indelibly the title of _kul_, or slave.[137]\r\nThe sultan’s sons, though they might sit upon the throne, would be the\r\nconsorts of none but slaves. Long before Suleiman’s time, the sultans\r\nhad practically ceased either to obtain brides of royal rank, or to give\r\nthe title of wife to the mothers of their children.[138] Suleiman, given\r\nto legality and religious observance, and greatly devoted to the lovely\r\nRoxelana, made her his lawful wife. Since, by the Sacred Law, the status\r\nof the mother as wife or slave does not affect the legitimacy of the\r\nchildren if the father acknowledges them,[139] all children born in the\r\nharem were of equal legitimacy and rank.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER OTTOMAN SLAVE-FAMILIES\r\n\r\nThe ruling institution of any state is apt to be copied in miniature by\r\nmany organizations within the same state. The municipalities of Rome, and\r\nthe state and city governments of the United States, were each modeled\r\nafter the central government. In a similar way, every great officer\r\nof the Ottoman court built up a slave-family after the model of the\r\nRuling Institution. The grand vizier had a very large establishment;\r\nthe viziers had somewhat smaller ones; the governors of provinces had\r\nhouseholds in proportion to their incomes;[140] and each adult prince\r\nkept a miniature government. Not only the slave-family feature but all\r\nthe other features of the Ruling Institution were imitated. All deemed it\r\nmeritorious to purchase Christians and turn them into Moslems. Iskender\r\nChelebi had a highly successful educational system;[141] he also kept a\r\nlittle standing army, and at a later time so did Rustem.[142] Each great\r\nofficer protected his slaves, each kept them about him like a court, each\r\nused them as a little government to rule his affairs. Such imitation\r\nmight easily become a danger to the state, but ordinarily a prompt\r\nremedy could be applied. Every such household was strictly personal;\r\nit was gathered about a living man; that man was ordinarily himself a\r\nslave of the sultan: let him show the least movement toward treason, and\r\nhis head would be removed, his property would come to his master, his\r\nhousehold would be incorporated with the central slave-family, all danger\r\nwould be at an end, and the sultan would only be the stronger. Further\r\nsafeguards lay in the close relations of the head of each slave-family\r\nto the sultan, and in the fact that some _Spahis_ of the Porte and other\r\nimperial _kullar_ of inferior position seem usually to have been attached\r\nto the suite of each great official.[143] Moslem private citizens also\r\nkept slave-families as numerous as they could afford,[144] but these\r\ncould hardly become dangerous under any circumstances. They might emulate\r\nthe missionary and educational character of the greater households, but\r\nthey would not dare attempt any imitation of the military features.\r\nFurther, the whole Ottoman system so discouraged great accumulations of\r\nwealth that private citizens could never hope to compete with the power\r\nof officials and of the sultan.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARACTER OF OTTOMAN SLAVERY\r\n\r\nOttoman slavery was a very different institution from that which\r\nAnglo-Saxons have practised. In it there could ordinarily be no\r\ncolor-line, and therefore no ineffaceable distinction. Where difference\r\nin color existed it counted for nothing, by old Islamic customs. Nor\r\ndid the fact of slavery impart any indelible taint. Islam knew slave\r\nand free;[145] in the Ottoman Empire, at least, it knew no intermediate\r\nclass of freedmen.[146] The sultan seems never to have emancipated\r\nhis slaves, probably because of a lingering Oriental theory, foreign\r\nto Mohammedanism,[147] that all his subjects were his slaves. Private\r\ncitizens had the power of emancipation,[148] and they often exercised\r\nit as a meritorious act. The slave who was set free was immediately\r\nin possession of full rights.[149] Slavery had therefore no inherent\r\nquality. It was merely an accidental misfortune from which complete\r\nrecovery was possible. The idea of Aristotle, that some men are born to\r\nbe slaves, was wholly absent.\r\n\r\nWhere no permanent wall of separation exists, natural human affection\r\ncan have free play. The Moslem religion teaches kindness and benevolence\r\nto all but armed enemies of the faith.[150] Moslem masters, in constant\r\npersonal association with persons whose condition led them to strive to\r\nplease, were apt to become very friendly toward them. Such friendliness\r\noften led to warm affection and the bestowal of benefits. Emancipation\r\nwas one of these; and, further, not only the sultan but many of his\r\nsubjects did not hesitate to give their daughters in marriage to worthy\r\nslaves.[151] A slave was often beloved above a son;[152] it was felt\r\nthat, while a son possessed a character which was more or less a matter\r\nof chance, a slave had been selected. Thus it is clear why the sultan’s\r\nslaves were sometimes called his children,[153] and why the title of\r\n_kul_ was prized.[154] Suleiman was a stern, and sometimes a cruel parent\r\nto his great family; but he was as just in rewarding as in punishing, and\r\nit is not surprising that all his slaves were true to him.[155]\r\n\r\nThus was woven what has well been termed “a wonderful fabric of\r\nslavery.”[156] History may have known as large a slave-family, but\r\ncertainly none that was more powerful and honorable, better provided for\r\nand rewarded, more obedient and more contented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE RULING INSTITUTION: AS MISSIONARY ENTERPRISE AND EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE MISSIONARY MOTIVE\r\n\r\nAlthough almost every member of the governing group in the Ottoman\r\nEmpire had been born a Christian, it was absolutely necessary for his\r\nadvancement that he should profess the Moslem faith. A keen contemporary\r\nobserver knew of only one Christian who had been entrusted with great\r\npower. Alvise Gritti was allowed to hold special command in Hungary, but\r\nthis appointment was made outside the system, as a personal affair of the\r\ngrand vizier Ibrahim, without the concurrence of the sultan.[157] Various\r\nChristians were employed in such matters as the superintendence of\r\nship-building and cannon-founding;[158] but this was a purely commercial\r\nrelationship, and such a man had no place in the _cursus honorum_. The\r\nfundamental rule, open to the few exceptions previously described, was\r\nvery simple. Every member of the Ruling Institution must have been born a\r\nChristian and must have become a Mohammedan.\r\n\r\nA number of questions arise at once. Why were none but sons of Christians\r\nadmitted? Why was conversion essential to promotion? What was the process\r\nof accomplishing conversion? How thorough was the conversion? Why were\r\nthe sons of most of the converts, and the grandsons of practically all,\r\ncarefully pushed out of the system?\r\n\r\nThe first of these questions might be answered in terms of policy of\r\nstate; but since, in all Moslem thinking, church, state, and society\r\nform one undivided whole, such an answer would be inadequate. Conversion\r\nto Mohammedanism meant much more than an inward change and an outward\r\nassociation for religious purposes with a new group of worshippers.\r\nIt meant the adoption of a new law for the whole of life, beginning\r\nwith the religious and ethical, but including as equally essential\r\nportions the regulation of all social, commercial, military, and\r\npolitical relationships.[159] It meant admission to a new social system,\r\nnaturalization in a new nation, an entire separation from the old life\r\nin all its aspects and a complete incorporation with the new. Expansion\r\nof membership was always a cardinal principle of Mohammedanism; and the\r\nexpansion was to be not merely by the aid of the sword, but far more by\r\npeaceful means. The sword took the land and sometimes the body of the\r\nunbeliever; but his soul was to be won by the benefits of the system,\r\nfirst religious, then social, financial, and political.[160] Every nation\r\nthat has reached eminence has believed firmly that its general system\r\nwas immensely the superior of every other in the world, and no nations\r\nhave been more thoroughly convinced of this than those of Moslem faith.\r\nAccordingly, their desire to convert the unbeliever was founded primarily\r\non benevolence. Closely connected with this motive was a burning interest\r\nin the grandeur of Islam as a militant, expanding system; and subordinate\r\nthereto was a purpose to increase the wealth, numbers, and power of the\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OTTOMAN ATTITUDE\r\n\r\nThe Ottoman system incorporated young Christians not merely to obtain\r\nmore faithful, more obedient, and more single-hearted servants, but,\r\nbefore and beyond this, to obtain new members of the Ottoman nationality,\r\nnew believers in the Moslem faith, and new warriors for the Ottoman\r\nEmpire as representing Islam. This missionary purpose stands out\r\nvery clearly in the words attributed to Kara Khalil Chendereli, the\r\ntraditional founder of the corps of Janissaries, by a poet-historian\r\nof the early sixteenth century, who no doubt here, as elsewhere in his\r\nwritings, introduced the ideas of his own day: “The conquered are slaves\r\nof the conquerors, to whom their goods, their women, and their children\r\nbelong as a lawful possession; in converting the children to Islam by\r\nforce, and in enrolling them as soldiers in the service of the faith, one\r\nis working for their happiness in this world and their eternal salvation.\r\nAccording to the words of the Prophet, every infant comes into the world\r\nwith the beginnings of Islam, which, developing in an army formed of\r\nChristian children, will encourage even in that of the infidels the ardor\r\nof conversion to Islam; and the new troop will recruit itself not merely\r\nwith the children of the conquered, but also with a crowd of deserters\r\nfrom the enemy, united to the believers by common origin or pretended\r\nopinions.”[161] The sentiment of this declaration is woven of two\r\nstrands, both ultimately religious,—a desire to convert great numbers to\r\nIslam, and a purpose to strengthen the army which wars for the faith.\r\n\r\nMohammed the Conqueror expressed the same idea poetically in a letter\r\nto Uzun Hassan: “Our empire is the home of Islam; from father to son\r\nthe lamp of our empire is kept burning with oil from the hearts of the\r\ninfidels.”[162] This declaration seems to reveal two things. First, the\r\nConqueror asserts that, since by Moslem theory there can be but one _Dar\r\nul-Islam_, or land of Islam, his empire is the sole lawful Moslem state;\r\nsecond, he declares that, by the policy of his house, the empire derives\r\nits strength from the ever-renewed supply of Christians. Whether this\r\nexegesis be exact or not, the fact is indisputable that the fundamental\r\nmissionary spirit of Islam was strong in the Ottomans of the sixteenth\r\ncentury,[163] and that the Ruling Institution was deliberately conducted\r\nfor the purpose, among others, of transferring the ablest and most useful\r\nof the subject Christians in each generation into the dominant nation. As\r\nthe first Western observer who comprehended the system remarked, “This\r\ncomes from no accident, but from a certain essential interior foundation\r\nand cause, which,” he feels it his Christian duty to say, with a helpless\r\nadmiration, “is desperation of good, and obstinacy in evil, and ... is\r\nthe work of the devil.”[164] Not only did Mohammedanism encourage the\r\npractice of taking in outsiders to serve, fight, and aid in ruling, but\r\nthis practice was thoroughly in harmony with the old Turkish spirit which\r\nprevailed in the steppe lands, and a similar policy had been followed\r\nby the Byzantine Empire. Thus, in encouraging the incorporation of\r\nforeigners the three great influences which met in the Ottoman state had\r\nexerted a combined activity as perhaps in no other direction. The Ruling\r\nInstitution acted for centuries as a great steadily-working machine for\r\nconversion.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER MOTIVES FOR INCORPORATING CHRISTIANS\r\n\r\nBesides the combined religious and national purpose which led to the\r\nintroduction of Christian youth into the system, other motives helped\r\nto give it definite shape. That purpose alone would hardly have caused\r\na rigid rule to be laid down which would exclude Mohammedans. Here,\r\nundoubtedly, the well-known tendency of governments that rest on force\r\nto rely upon servants brought from a distance and owing all to their\r\nfavor came strongly into play.[165] The sultan’s _kullar_ were uniformly\r\nfaithful to the hand that had raised them from poverty to high position.\r\n“Being all slaves by condition, and slaves of a single lord, from whom\r\nalone they hope for greatness, honor, and riches, and from whom alone\r\non the other hand they fear punishment, chastisement, and death, what\r\nwonder that in his presence and in rivalry with each other they will\r\ndo stupendous things?”[166] Having expected ill treatment from the\r\nenemies of their nation, they were drawn by the surprising contrast to\r\ndeep gratitude and boundless devotion;[167] they were not attached to\r\ninterests and traditions of family and property which would prevent full\r\nand loyal obedience; they learned what was taught them by their master’s\r\ncommand, and were not possessed by ideas and prejudices that would make\r\nthem independent in mind and intractable. On the contrary, Moslems born\r\nand bred in pride of religion and nationality could not easily be moulded\r\nto the shape desired; the very title of _kul_ was out of harmony with\r\ntheir beliefs; hence they were inherently unavailable for the system, and\r\nthe recognition of this fact led to their rigid exclusion. An important\r\nreason for excluding children of renegades was that heredity of privilege\r\nand office was against Ottoman policy. The immunity from taxation that\r\nwas enjoyed by the sultan’s officials would tend to the building up of\r\nvast fortunes that would be beyond the reach of public taxation;[168] and\r\nthe power of great families entrenched behind large property interests\r\nwould in time endanger the supremacy of the throne.[169]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REQUIREMENT OF CONVERSION\r\n\r\nConversion was a principal object of the system, and favor and promotion\r\nwaited as rewards upon acceptance of the Moslem faith. In fact, a young\r\nman was not fitted to participate in the system until he had turned\r\nMoslem. He could not be an Ottoman warrior and statesman and fail to\r\nprofess and practise, in most respects, at any rate, the system which\r\ninspired his fighting and on whose principles the state rested. The\r\ngarment was seamless: it must be either worn or not worn.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, conversion of the neophytes of the Ruling Institution\r\nseems not ordinarily to have been forcible.[170] The Ottomans were too\r\nwise to believe that the best results could be accomplished by such\r\nmeans. Their policy was rather to throw every difficulty in the way\r\nof remaining a Christian, and to offer every inducement to make the\r\nMoslem faith and system seem attractive. To this end their educational\r\nscheme helped greatly;[171] for it involved complete isolation from\r\nChristian ideas of every sort, and complete saturation in all the ideas\r\nof Mohammedanism, religious, moral, social, and political. Even those\r\nwhose education was mainly physical were isolated from Christians in a\r\nstrict Moslem environment. No doubt there were special rejoicings and\r\nrewards when a _kul_ was ready to declare, “There is no God but Allah\r\nand Mohammed is His Prophet,” as there were in like circumstances in the\r\nrest of the Ottoman world.[172] But the _kullar_ seem not to have been\r\nurged to change their faith; on the contrary, an attitude of apparent\r\nindifference was sometimes taken with them.[173] Probably, however, few\r\nwho remained long in the system failed to surrender sooner or later.\r\nPrejudices of child-hood would in time be overcome; what the majority\r\ndid would tend to act powerfully upon the individual; the reward of a\r\nbrilliant career would take clearer and more alluring shape, until in\r\ntime, in the absence of all contrary suggestion, the real truth and value\r\nof the Mohammedan religion would make it appear to be the only worthy\r\nsystem. It is not surprising that the scheme seemed to Christians one of\r\ndiabolical ingenuity.\r\n\r\nWhat went on in the sultan’s slave-family in regard to the conversion\r\nof slaves went on in every Mohammedan household. Conversion was desired\r\nbut not compelled, and reward awaited it.[174] Among female slaves also,\r\neven in the imperial harem, the same process was employed. Not merely\r\nthe imperial slave-family, but the entire system of slavery that existed\r\nin the Ottoman Empire, was thus a great machine for the conversion of\r\nChristians into Turks.\r\n\r\n\r\nSINCERITY OF CONVERSION\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to learn what thoughts possessed the hearts of the members\r\nof the Ruling Institution. Enough is recorded, however, to show that not\r\nall who turned Moslem did so without mental reservation, and to prove\r\nthat it was possible to hold fast to an inward belief in the superiority\r\nof Christianity through many years spent in the sultan’s service. It\r\nhas been said sometimes that the converted Christians were more severe\r\nthan the Moslems toward their brethren who remained steadfast.[175] This\r\nwould be natural both because of the zeal of new converts, and because\r\nChristianity is intrinsically less tolerant than Mohammedanism; but the\r\naccusation does not seem to be supported as against the members of the\r\nRuling Institution. A distinction must be drawn between behavior in time\r\nof war and in time of peace. The Janissaries were fierce fighters and\r\nterrible enemies; but religiously they belonged to a sect which was so\r\nliberal as to be accused of rank heresy, and even, it is said, to have\r\nbeen denied the name of true believers.[176] Many of the renegades were\r\npersons who held no sort of religion.[177] The grand vizier Rustem told\r\nBusbecq, after offering him great rewards if he would turn Moslem, that\r\nhe believed in the salvation of those of other faiths;[178] and a _deli_,\r\nor scout, in his service confided to a French gentleman that, while he\r\npretended to follow Mohammedanism, he was a Christian at heart.[179]\r\nThe fact that a Genoese boy, taken at twelve years of age, educated as\r\na favored page for eight or nine years, and evidently trained carefully\r\nin Mohammedan beliefs, would seize the first opportunity to escape shows\r\nwhat was possible beneath the surface.[180] Two generations earlier there\r\nwas a renegade who cursed the day when he had turned Turk, but who felt\r\nthat he could not go back.[181] Nor were the members of the system always\r\nsubmissive to the stricter rules of Mohammedan ethics. The Janissaries,\r\nfor example, forced Bayezid II to reopen the wine shops of the capital,\r\nwhich in the religious fervor of his later years he had ordered\r\nclosed;[182] and the members of the government were led by fondness for\r\ndisplay and lavish expenditure into shameless venality, the cause and the\r\neffect being equally contrary to the teachings and example of Mohammed.\r\nThe probability is that large numbers of the sultan’s slaves were merely\r\nnominal Mohammedans in religious belief, though they necessarily followed\r\nthe larger part of the Moslem scheme of life.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF THE PROCESS\r\n\r\nSons of Janissaries were not allowed to become Janissaries, although the\r\nrule began to be infringed about the end of Suleiman’s reign.[183] Sons\r\nof _Spahis_ of the Porte might be admitted as pages and to the corps of\r\n_Spahi-oghlans_, but their grandsons were rigidly excluded.[184] Sons of\r\ngreat officials were provided with fiefs, or pensions, and so usually\r\npassed out of the Ruling Institution into the territorial army.[185]\r\nThus few were allowed in the scheme beyond the first generation in the\r\nMoslem faith, and almost none beyond the second. The explanation of this\r\nhas been given already: descendants of renegades were Moslems, and hence\r\nsubject to the same disqualifications as members of Mohammedan families\r\nof long standing. Not all Moslems of the empire were counted Ottomans,\r\nor, as they called themselves, Osmanlis, or, as they are commonly called\r\nnowadays, Turks; for Arabs, Kurds, and other Mohammedans who had not\r\nadopted the Turkish language did not bear the Turkish name. But all\r\nthe descendants of members of the Ruling Institution were added to the\r\nOttoman-Turkish nationality. The total number of Janissaries in the three\r\ncenturies during which they were recruited from Christian children has\r\nbeen estimated at five hundred thousand;[186] but, as reckoned above,\r\nthe tribute boys furnished less than one-half of the recruits of the\r\ninstitution,[187] and the page system persisted in its original form\r\nafter the Janissaries had become hereditary. From one to two millions of\r\nthe flower of the Christian population must have been brought into the\r\nOttoman nation by the operation of the Ruling Institution.\r\n\r\nIt does not necessarily follow that a like number of new Turkish families\r\nwere thus founded. The Janissaries were not supposed to marry, although\r\nthe rule was not strictly enforced;[188] a hundred years later, at\r\nany rate, the majority are said to have been unmarried.[189] As the\r\n_Spahis_ of the Porte probably married late, when they married at all,\r\nthe whole system had thus something of a monastic aspect.[190] High\r\nofficials, it is true, were apt to keep harems of some size; yet the\r\nchildren even of these were ordinarily few in number.[191] Furthermore,\r\nthe frequent fierce wars carried off many of the sultan’s slaves, and\r\nthe danger of execution and of confiscation of property put a check on\r\ntheir establishment of families. It is probable, therefore, that the\r\nRuling Institution, like most great slave-families, was wasteful of\r\nhuman life.[192] But although its Christian-born members may not have\r\nperpetuated their numbers, they nevertheless increased the Ottoman nation\r\nby the addition of such children as were born to them; and the Moslem\r\ndescendants of these, sailing in quieter waters, doubtless became, both\r\nnumerically and otherwise, a great strength to the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE EDUCATIONAL SCHEME\r\n\r\nPlato would have been delighted with the training of the sultan’s great\r\nfamily, though his nature would have revolted from its lowliness of\r\nbirth. He would have approved of the life-long education, the equally\r\ncareful training of body and mind, the separation into soldiers and\r\nrulers (even though it was not complete), the relative freedom from\r\nfamily ties, the system’s rigid control of the individual, and, above\r\nall, of the government by the wise. Whether the founders of the Ottoman\r\nsystem were acquainted with Plato will probably never be known, but they\r\nseem to have come as near to his plan as it is possible to come in a\r\nworkable scheme. In some practical ways they even improved upon Plato,—as\r\nby avoiding the uncertainties of heredity, by supplying a personal\r\ndirecting power, by insuring permanence through a balance of forces, and\r\nby making their system capable of vast imperial rule.\r\n\r\nIn the largest sense the Ruling Institution was a school in which the\r\npupils were enrolled for life. Constantly under careful drill and\r\ndiscipline, they advanced from stage to stage through all their days,\r\nrewarded systematically in accordance with their deserts by promotions,\r\nhonors, and gifts, and punished rigorously for infraction of rules, while\r\nboth rewards and punishments increased from stage to stage until the\r\nformer included all that life under the Moslem scheme could offer, and\r\nthe latter threatened to take away the life itself. The system also cared\r\nfor all sides of the nature of its pupils, subject to the considerable\r\nlimitation that it was especially a school of war and government. The\r\nbodies of all were trained as thoroughly as were the minds of the\r\nbest. Though all received some mental training, including at least an\r\nacquaintance with the Moslem mode of life, the ablest were put through a\r\nsevere course in Oriental languages and Moslem and Ottoman law, which\r\nembraced ethics and theology. Thus both body and mind, as well as the\r\nreligious nature, were provided for systematically and through life.\r\nLooked at thus, the Ottoman educational scheme, in its relations to the\r\nwhole lives of those under instruction, was more comprehensive than any\r\nWestern institution of learning. The officers of a Western army are\r\neducated and organized in a life-long system which provides for both\r\nbody and mind; but they do not learn theology and they do not govern the\r\nnation. Great American railroads and manufacturing corporations possess\r\nschemes of education and advancement which bear comparison to the Ottoman\r\nsystem in life-long scope, promotion for merit, and the possibility of\r\nrising from the bottom to the top; but the mental training which they\r\ngive even to their ablest helpers is of a highly technical sort, which\r\nbears no comparison to the general learning and finished culture bestowed\r\nupon the most studious in the Ottoman scheme. In general, Western\r\nuniversities and educational systems, although they far surpass the\r\nOttoman scheme in the scope and character of the intellectual training\r\nwhich they give, do not provide a comparable systematic training of the\r\nbody; and their control over the lives of their students ceases early.\r\nThe superior comprehensiveness of the Ottoman system was, of course,\r\nbased upon the fact that its members were slaves. Their master could keep\r\nthem at school all their lives, in order that they might become better\r\nand better trained to serve him. At the same time, reward was considered\r\nmore potent than the rod. Unequalled prizes were offered in this school,\r\nso skilfully disposed and graded as to call out the utmost strivings and\r\nthe best work of every pupil.\r\n\r\nThe first stages of the wide scheme, which constitute the educational\r\nsystem in its narrower sense, were a fitting introduction to the rest.\r\nAll the recruits for the sultan’s slave-family, whether captured, bought,\r\npresented, or levied, to the number of probably three or four thousand\r\nannually, with an addition of ten or twelve thousand in the years of\r\nthe _devshurmeh_,[193] were brought by a regular process before trained\r\nofficials, carefully registered, and divided into two classes.[194]\r\nThose who best satisfied the criterions of bodily perfection, muscular\r\nstrength, and intellectual ability so far as it could be judged without\r\nlong testing,[195]—about one in every ten of the whole number,—were\r\nchosen for a superior quality of training, especially on the intellectual\r\nside. The remainder were destined for a different education, which was\r\nmainly physical.[196] The first regularly became pages and _Spahis_\r\nof the Porte, and the ablest of them rose to the great offices of the\r\narmy and the government. The others regularly became _Ajem-oghlans_ and\r\nJanissaries, but the ablest of these might also rise to positions as\r\n_Spahis_ of the Porte and even as generals and officers of state.[197]\r\nFailure to be selected for the higher school was not, therefore, a\r\nfinal restriction to low position. Merit was recognized everywhere, and\r\nregularly led to promotion. At the same time, it was a distinct advantage\r\nto a young man to be chosen for the higher training, since he would\r\nreceive greater care, would acquire more of both ornamental and useful\r\nlearning, and would associate with those already great, and perhaps with\r\nthe sultan himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COLLEGES OF PAGES\r\n\r\nOf those selected for the higher training, a portion were distributed\r\namong the households of the provincial governors and high officers at\r\nthe capital.[198] These were probably brought up in much the same way as\r\nif they had remained with the sultan. The very choicest of the recruits,\r\nto the number of perhaps two hundred annually, or twelve to fifteen\r\nhundred in all,[199] were taken into three palaces of the sultan as\r\n_Itch-oghlans_, or pages. Three or four hundred were in the palace at\r\nAdrianople,[200] a like number in one at Galata,[201] and from five to\r\neight hundred in the principal palace at Stamboul.[202] These were all\r\nhandsome boys, physically perfect, and of marked intellectual promise.\r\nAn excellent idea of the international character of the college is given\r\nby a Venetian writer, who said that the pages of the palace included\r\nBulgarians, Hungarians, Transylvanians, Poles, Bohemians, Germans,\r\nItalians, Spaniards, a few French, many Albanians, Slavs, Greeks,\r\nCircassians, and Russians.[203]\r\n\r\nThe _Itch-oghlans_ were dressed in suitable raiment and were well cared\r\nfor without luxury.[204] That the sultan took a particular interest in\r\nthe arrival of excellent specimens is evident from the reception that\r\nMenavino received.[205] The general Ottoman attitude toward the pages,\r\nand indeed toward all recruits, has been well expressed by a thoughtful\r\nobserver: “The Turks rejoice greatly when they find an exceptional man,\r\nas though they had acquired a precious object, and they spare no labor or\r\neffort in cultivating him; especially if they discern that he is fit for\r\nwar. Our plan [that is, in Western Europe] is very different; for if we\r\nfind a good dog, hawk, or horse, we are greatly delighted, and we spare\r\nnothing to bring it to the greatest perfection of its kind. But if a man\r\nhappens to possess an extraordinary disposition, we do not take like\r\npains; nor do we think that his education is especially our affair; and\r\nwe receive much pleasure and many kinds of service from the well-trained\r\nhorse, dog, and hawk; but the Turks much more from a well-educated man\r\n(_ex homine bonis moribus informato_), in proportion as the nature\r\nof a man is more admirable and more excellent than that of the other\r\nanimals.”[206]\r\n\r\nThat the primary object of the page system was educational appears from\r\nall contemporary observations. Not merely are their palaces termed\r\n“places for nourishing youths,”[207] but Menavino calls the place where\r\nhe was taught “the palace school.”[208] Another writer gives chapters\r\non “The Education of Young Men in the Seraglio,” and “The Studies and\r\nLearning in the Seraglio,”[209] and speaks of the young men as “designed\r\nfor the great offices of the empire.” Another says, “And the said emperor\r\ndoes this good for the profit of his soul, and when they are grown up he\r\ntakes them from there and gives them dignities and offices, according\r\nas it seems to the emperor they have deserved.”[210] Some of the pages\r\nwere the personal servants of the sultan, and a band of thirty-nine\r\nconstituted his gentlemen of the bedchamber, or _Khas Oda_.[211] These\r\nwere the élite of all, chosen by selection after selection; and, though\r\nyoung, they ranked very high in the system. Since only a few of all\r\nthe pages could attain to this honor, the remainder were at school for\r\noutside service.[212]\r\n\r\nBesides many less direct descriptions of the course of training,\r\ntwo exist which are derived from men who passed through the palace\r\nschool. Menavino tells his own story;[213] and Ricaut records what\r\nhe learned from a Polish captive who had spent nineteen years in the\r\nsultan’s service and had reached high position.[214] Although these\r\naccounts were written one hundred and fifty years apart, they agree in\r\nessentials. Menavino does not refer to the physical training in arms and\r\nhorsemanship; but at the time of his escape he showed himself, if not a\r\ncourageous, yet an accomplished horseman. Postel, some twenty years after\r\nMenavino’s time, describes this training in some detail. He probably had\r\nhis information from a French page named Cabazolles, whom he quotes as\r\nauthority on one point.[215]\r\n\r\nThe pages were trained in the art of war, the use of all sorts of arms,\r\nand good horsemanship.[216] Suleiman took especial delight in watching\r\ntheir cavalry evolutions, and occasionally summoned a page who pleased\r\nhim, conversed with him, and dismissed him with presents.[217] Also, by\r\nold Oriental custom, every page was taught some handicraft useful in his\r\nmaster’s service, and, no doubt, intended to provide for his own support\r\nin case of need.[218]\r\n\r\nMenavino describes the course of study in the so-called _Yeni Oda_, or\r\nNew Chamber, which contained from eighty to a hundred boys. “When a boy\r\nhas remained five or six days in that school, they set him to learning\r\nthe alphabet. There are four teachers in the school. One drills the\r\nboys in reading during their first year. Another teaches the Koran in\r\nthe Arabic (_Moresco_) language, giving explanations of the different\r\narticles of their faith. After this a third teaches books in the\r\nPersian tongue, and some write a little, but they do not teach writing\r\nwillingly. A fourth teaches Arabic books, both vulgar and literary.” It\r\nis interesting to notice that, from the first, rewards in the form of\r\npay were given for labor. “These boys,” continues Menavino, “have a daily\r\nallowance of two aspers during the first year, three during the second\r\nyear, four during the third year, and thus their allowance increases\r\neach year. They receive scarlet garments twice a year, and some robes\r\nof white cloth for the summer.”[219] Postel describes how they learned\r\nwith great diligence Arabic and Turkish letters and the law.[220] Ricaut\r\nexplains in more detail that the chief object of the course of study\r\nwas to teach reading and writing for the purpose of giving inspection\r\ninto the books of law and religion, especially the Koran. He says that\r\nArabic was taught to enable the boys to inspect the writings of the\r\njudges and to have knowledge of religion, Persian to give them quaint\r\nwords and handsome and gentle deportment, and adds that both tongues\r\nmight be needed in governing Eastern regions. He gives a list of their\r\ntext-books, and remarks that those who wished to become men of the pen\r\nstudied with greater exactness. They were not, he says, taught logic,\r\nphysics, metaphysics, mathematics, or geography, and their knowledge of\r\nancient history was much mixed. “Yet as to the successes and progress\r\nof Affairs in their own Dominions,” he adds, “they keep most strict\r\nRegisters and Records, which serve them as Presidents and Rules for the\r\npresent Government of their Affairs.”[221] This shows that the pages were\r\ninstructed in Turkish history and the various _Kanun-namehs_, or imperial\r\nlaws. Most of the teachers were Anatolian Turks,[222] chosen no doubt, as\r\nimparting better pronunciation and more orthodox religious views.\r\n\r\nDiscipline was severe,[223] but was kept within bounds. A page could be\r\nbeaten on the soles of his feet with no more than ten strokes, and not\r\nmore than once on any one day.[224] The boys, organized in groups of ten,\r\nwere watched carefully by eunuchs, both day and night.[225] Absolute\r\nobedience, modest behavior and decorum, and good manners were taught\r\nwith great insistency.[226] The two sections, or _odalar_, at the palace\r\nseem to have been of equal rank,[227] while the schools in Pera and\r\nAdrianople ranked lower.[228] Select boys who had finished their studies\r\nwere promoted through the different chambers of the personal service of\r\nthe sultan to the Inner Chamber,[229] where twelve or fifteen of the\r\nthirty-nine held titular offices.[230] On reaching the age of twenty-five\r\nevery page was sent out from the school.[231] Those from the Inner\r\nChamber passed at once to places in the Noble Guard (_Muteferrika_), or\r\nto governorships of towns.[232] Ibrahim passed almost directly to the\r\nplace of grand vizier;[233] but he was the first to break the regular\r\norder of promotion, and in after times much evil was held to date from\r\nthe precedent.[234] The majority passed into the regular cavalry, or\r\n_Spahis_ of the Porte.[235] Those who left the school were honored by a\r\nceremony of farewell. The sultan personally commended each one, and gave\r\nhim encouragement for good conduct in his new position. He presented each\r\nwith an embroidered coat and one of his most beautiful horses, and often\r\na gift in money. The young man, with all the presents he had received\r\nduring his stay, was escorted to the great gate, where he mounted his\r\nhorse triumphantly, and departed from the palace forever.[236]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HAREM\r\n\r\nProbably because of the tendency of the human mind to construct along\r\nparallel lines, the imperial harem partook of the characteristics of the\r\nschools of pages. There were two _odalar_, or rooms, for the recruits of\r\nthe harem, in which they were taught housework, sewing and embroidery,\r\nmanners and deportment.[237] They were organized in groups of ten,\r\neach group under a matron. Those with a taste for music and dancing\r\nlearned those accomplishments, those who were studious learned to read\r\nand write. All were carefully instructed in the system of Islam. Like\r\nthe pages, nearly all of them passed out of the palace at the age of\r\ntwenty-five, being given in marriage to _Spahis_ of the Porte or to other\r\nofficials.[238] Thus the harem might be considered a training-school of\r\nslave-wives for the sultan himself and for the most highly honored of his\r\n_kullar_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AJEM-OGHLANS\r\n\r\nThe term _ajemi-oghlanlar_ signifies “foreign youth,” and was sometimes\r\napplied to all the young recruits. Ordinarily, however, it was given\r\nonly to the remainder left after the pages had been selected. These, for\r\nthe most part destined to become Janissaries, probably numbered about\r\ntwenty thousand.[239] Their training was largely physical, industrial,\r\nand military, with oral instruction in the Turkish language and the\r\nprinciples of the Mohammedan system. The _Ajem-oghlans_ usually passed\r\nthrough two or three stages. Unless they knew Turkish and something\r\nof Turkish ways, they were first scattered through Asia Minor in the\r\nservice of Moslem country gentlemen.[240] There they were set at hard\r\nagricultural labor, to strengthen their bodies to the utmost. They were\r\nexpected to learn to speak and understand the Turkish language and to\r\nlearn the faith, the laws, and the customs of the Turks. The sultan\r\nallowed them no pay. The gentlemen whom they served, responsible for\r\nthem to the sultan, supplied them with food and clothing and whatever\r\nelse they were pleased to give.[241] The number of these _Ajem-oghlans_\r\nof the first stage may be estimated as ten thousand.[242] At the\r\nend of two or three years, or perhaps at about the time for a new\r\n_devshurmeh_,[243] officers came to examine them. If they knew enough\r\nTurkish and were strong and well-grown, they passed to the next stage.\r\n\r\nHaving been brought to Constantinople, and once more carefully inscribed\r\nand estimated,[244] the _Ajem-oghlans_ were again distributed, but now\r\nin groups. About two thousand were assigned to service with the fleet\r\nat Gallipoli.[245] Another two thousand, probably the most intelligent,\r\nwere appointed as gardeners, or _Bostanjis_, to the sultan’s palaces in\r\nStamboul, Adrianople, Brusa, and Magnesia;[246] and five hundred or more\r\nserved in other capacities about the palaces, as wood-cutters, helpers\r\nin the kitchen, and the like.[247] Five or six thousand were kept in\r\nConstantinople and employed in the shipyards or on public buildings,[248]\r\nor were hired out in bands of one hundred or more to private citizens\r\nfor hard labor of various sorts.[249] Some were hired out similarly in\r\nother cities.[250] In the midst of such a variety of occupations, two\r\nobjects seem always to have been kept in mind,—the _Ajem-oghlans_ were\r\nto develop the utmost strength of body, and they were to learn some\r\ntrade useful in war.[251] In this stage they were normally organized\r\nin groups or messes of ten. The gardeners were under the charge of an\r\nofficial of high rank and great authority, who bore the humble title of\r\n_Bostanji-bashi_, or head gardener; he was aided by under officers and\r\nan administrative staff. Those in Constantinople were under the orders\r\nof an _Agha_, or general officer, with a staff of under officials,\r\nclerks, and accountants.[252] Being filled with the spirit of youth,\r\nconscious of their superior physical strength and privileged position,\r\ngathered together in large groups, and unrestrained by substantial mental\r\ninstruction, the _Ajem-oghlans_ were by no means easy to manage. They\r\nfrequently raised great disturbances in the city, in emulation perhaps\r\nof the Janissaries.[253] Those who wished were allowed to learn to read\r\nand write, but they were not obliged to do so.[254] They received a small\r\namount of pay, with food and clothing.[255]\r\n\r\nAfter a certain time spent in this stage of development, the majority\r\nof the _Ajem-oghlans_ were assigned, one by one as each seemed ready,\r\nto the service of the _odalar_, or messes, of the Janissaries.[256] The\r\nlatter then became responsible for their training in the art of war,\r\nand discharged this duty with much zeal. In the course of time, as the\r\n_Ajem-oghlans_ acquired sufficient skill, and as vacancies occurred,\r\nthey were enrolled as full-fledged Janissaries.[257] The gardeners of\r\nthe sultan’s palaces and the palace servants seem not ordinarily to have\r\nbecome Janissaries, but to have been advanced toward the directing of\r\nthe transport, commissary, and artillery services, the oversight of the\r\nimperial stables, and like positions in the administration of the army\r\nand the great household.[258] No doubt some of those assigned to the\r\nfleet were promoted in the navy, but most of them seem to have become\r\nJanissaries.[259] Thus a large number and variety of openings lay before\r\nthe _Ajem-oghlans_, who as they became ready were advanced into them. The\r\nordinary age of graduation from the corps was twenty-five years,[260]\r\nwhich may be regarded as the age of majority for all the sultan’s\r\nslaves. At times war caused such depletion of the upper service that\r\n_Ajem-oghlans_ were promoted before they had reached the desired age or\r\nwere thoroughly ready.[261]\r\n\r\n\r\nADVANCEMENT BASED ON MERIT\r\n\r\nThe entire system from start to finish was designed to reward merit and\r\nfully to satisfy every ambition that was backed by ability, effort, and\r\nsufficient preparation. Two parallel lines of reward were established,\r\nthe honorable and the financial. In the page school the first was\r\nrepresented by promotion from class to class, and, in the case of those\r\nwho were observed to be the most suitable, by advancement through the\r\nchambers of personal service to the _Khas Oda_. In this _oda_ they were\r\npromoted in regular order through the twelve or more special offices.[262]\r\n\r\nAmong the _Ajem-oghlans_ the process seems to have been carried on by\r\ncarefully observing and testing individuals, by advancing them from\r\nstage to stage on this basis, and by entrusting them in the later stages\r\nwith greater and greater responsibilities. The financial reward began\r\nfor the pages immediately upon admission to the school. It was then\r\nprobably about equal to the daily wages of an unskilled laborer. This\r\nwas increased regularly year by year, and in the _Khas Oda_ reached the\r\nproportions of a handsome salary.[263] The _Ajem-oghlans_ depended\r\nduring the first stage on the rewards assigned by their temporary\r\nmasters. After that stage they began to receive a small amount of\r\npay from the sultan, which was gradually increased.[264] All were\r\nprovided with food, lodging, and at least a part of their clothing, and\r\nindividuals might hope to obtain special gifts.\r\n\r\nThis double system was continued without a break through the entire\r\ninstitution. The lowest Janissary might hopefully aspire to promotion,\r\neither through the hierarchy of office in his own corps, or by\r\nbeing lifted out of it for service in the cavalry or the active\r\nadministration.[265] The pages who had passed out of the school were\r\nalready well up in the scale of advancement, and every place except the\r\nsultan’s own was within their grasp. The grand vizier, indeed, might\r\nwield almost the whole of the sultan’s power, a fact which Ibrahim,\r\nshortly before his fall, realized so fully that he added to his title of\r\n_Seraskier_ the word Sultan.[266] The losses occasioned by fierce and\r\nfrequent wars, and by not infrequent depositions and executions, gave\r\nabundant opportunity for men to rise from below. Conquest was continually\r\nadding new offices and commands. The whole Ruling Institution was, so to\r\nspeak, in a constant state of boiling, in which the human particles were\r\nrapidly rising to the top, and, alas, disappearing, while others rose as\r\nrapidly behind them.\r\n\r\nThe figure just employed is applicable, however, only to the mere\r\nphenomenon of rising: the upward movement was not in the least accidental\r\nor automatic; it was conducted with keen intelligence at every stage.\r\nNow and then, as in the case of Ibrahim, favor disturbed the scheme;\r\nbut this happened very seldom before the end of Suleiman’s reign.\r\nSometimes a temporary confusion resulted from extraordinary losses in\r\nwar, but order was soon restored. There is reason to believe that human\r\nhistory has never known a political institution which during so long a\r\nperiod was so completely dominated by sheer intellect, and thereby so\r\nunerringly held to its original plan and purpose, as was the Ottoman\r\nRuling Institution. The democracy of Athens attained an unexampled level\r\nof average intelligence, but under its sway the exceptional mind received\r\ndiscouragement rather than exceptional training. The free democracies of\r\nthe present age allow the gifted individual opportunities to fight his\r\nway upward, but against obstacles which sometimes become insuperable.\r\nThese systems are unquestionably superior on the whole to the Ottoman\r\nscheme, because of their inclusiveness and individual freedom; but as\r\nregards sheer efficiency, unobstructed opportunity, and certainty of\r\nreward, their operation is wasteful, clumsy, and blind by comparison.\r\n\r\nSome testimonies of shrewd contemporary observers will show how they\r\nregarded the Ottoman scheme of promotion both in itself and in comparison\r\nwith Western ways. The intelligent author of the _Tractatus_ is impressed\r\nby the unity and control of the scheme. “Out of the aforesaid slaves,” he\r\nwrites, “promotions are made to the offices of the kingdom according to\r\nthe virtues found in them. Whence it comes about that all the magnates\r\nand princes of the whole kingdom are as it were officials made by the\r\nking, and not lords or possessors; and as a consequence he is the sole\r\nlord and possessor, and the lawful dispenser, distributer, and governor\r\nof the whole kingdom; the others are only executors, officials, and\r\nadministrators according to his will and command.... Whence it follows\r\nthat in his kingdom, although there is an innumerable multitude, no\r\ncontradiction or opposition can arise; but, united as one man in all\r\nrespects and for all purposes, they look to his command alone, they obey\r\nand serve unwearyingly.”[267]\r\n\r\nPostel says: “The Seigneur [or sultan] has four or several principal\r\npersonages for all the business of his empire, whether in war or justice,\r\nand they are promoted to this honor by degrees from lower offices,\r\nalways mounting and giving good examples of living, unless by some\r\nextraordinary favor the prince raises them from some low place, which is\r\nvery perilous.”[268] Speaking of the pages in the palace, he adds: “When\r\nthey have lived there a long time and done well, they are given a place\r\nwhere they receive pay, and they are made Castellans and given other\r\noffices used among them. If there are some who have the ability to make\r\nthemselves known, they may have the best fortune in the world, and become\r\ngovernors of the land and Pashas; for there they judge of nobility by the\r\nworth which they see appearing in a man, and they give honors according\r\nto the evidence of his past.”[269] Of Suleiman, Tanco says, “He sows hope\r\nof certain reward in all conditions of men, who by means of virtue, may\r\nsucceed in mounting to better fortune”; and of the Janissaries, “Each has\r\nhis good and real fortune in his hand.”[270]\r\n\r\nAmong all observers, Busbecq seems to have been most impressed with the\r\nsystem of advancement by merit. “The Turks,” he tells us, “do not measure\r\neven their own people by any other rule than that of personal merit. The\r\nonly exception is the house of Ottoman; in this case, and in this case\r\nonly, does birth confer distinction.”[271]\r\n\r\nReferring to his audience with Suleiman, he says: “There was not in all\r\nthat great assembly a single man who owed his position to aught save\r\nhis valour and his merit. No distinction is attached to birth among the\r\nTurks; the deference to be paid to a man is measured by the position\r\nhe holds in the public service. There is no fighting for precedence; a\r\nman’s place is marked out by the duties he discharges. In making his\r\nappointments the sultan pays no regard to any pretensions on the score\r\nof wealth or rank, nor does he take into consideration recommendations\r\nor popularity; he considers each case on its own merits, and examines\r\ncarefully into the character, ability, and disposition of the man whose\r\npromotion is in question. It is by merit that men rise in the service, a\r\nsystem which ensures that posts should only be assigned to the competent.\r\nEach man in Turkey carries in his own hand his ancestry and his position\r\nin life, which he may make or mar as he will. Those who receive the\r\nhighest offices from the sultan are for the most part the sons of\r\nshepherds or herdsmen, and so far from being ashamed of their parentage,\r\nthey actually glory in it, and consider it a matter of boasting that\r\nthey owe nothing to the accident of birth; for they do not believe that\r\nhigh qualities are either natural or hereditary, nor do they think that\r\nthey can be handed down from father to son, but that they are partly the\r\ngift of God, and partly the result of good training, great industry, and\r\nunwearied zeal; arguing that high qualities do not descend from a father\r\nto his son or heir, any more than a talent for music, mathematics, or\r\nthe like; and that the mind does not derive its origin from the father,\r\nso that the son should necessarily be like the father in character, but\r\nemanates from heaven, and is thence infused into the human body. Among\r\nthe Turks, therefore, honours, high posts, and judgeships are the rewards\r\nof great ability and good service. If a man be dishonest, or lazy, or\r\ncareless, he remains at the bottom of the ladder, an object of contempt;\r\nfor such qualities there are no honours in Turkey!\r\n\r\n“This is the reason that they are successful in their undertakings, that\r\nthey lord it over others, and are daily extending the bounds of their\r\nempire. These are not our ideas; with us there is no opening left for\r\nmerit; birth is the standard for everything; the prestige of birth is the\r\nsole key to advancement in the public service.”[272]\r\n\r\nFinally, Ricaut, after describing the _Ajem-oghlans_, declares that this\r\npart of the system “is one of the most Politick Constitutions in the\r\nWorld, and none of the meanest supports of the _Ottoman_ Empire.”[273]\r\n\r\nFinancial rewards paralleled advancement in office with great exactness.\r\nWhen a man came to high position, he was provided with the means to live\r\nsplendidly in proportion to his rank. In addition to his salary, many\r\nopportunities of increasing his income presented themselves; and though\r\nsome of these would be considered undignified in Western eyes,[274]\r\nand others were undoubtedly stained with rapacity and extortion,[275]\r\nthey were allowed to be enjoyed under all ordinary circumstances.\r\nThe sultan’s higher officials not only lived in great splendor, with\r\na numerous retinue, a large harem, and many costly garments, dishes,\r\ngems, and the like, but they often accumulated great wealth in money,\r\nhouses, lands, mills, horses, cattle, sheep, and everything else that is\r\nconsidered worth collecting.[276] Thus, as men were promoted, they were\r\nenabled regularly to proportion display of wealth to rank and office.\r\n\r\nThe example of one of Suleiman’s chief servants will illustrate\r\nthe _cursus honorum_ in the Ottoman system. Ali Pasha was a native\r\nof Dalmatia. Levied with the tribute boys, he was admitted to the\r\nprincipal palace at the time when Ibrahim was _Oda-bashi_, or head\r\nof the Inner Chamber of pages. In the course of time he was made\r\n_Kapuji_, or gatekeeper. When Ibrahim became grand vizier, Ali became\r\n_Chasnejir_, or chief taster, to Suleiman, and held that office during\r\nthe expedition to Vienna in 1529. In due course he was discharged from\r\nthe palace, and appointed to high office outside. He soon reached the\r\ngrade of _Agha_, or general or the _Ghurebas_, the lowest of the four\r\ndivisions of the regular cavalry, and was then promoted to be _Agha_\r\nof the _Spahi-oghlans_, the highest of the cavalry divisions. Next he\r\nbecame second equerry and later first equerry (_Emir-al-Akhor_), then\r\n_Agha_ of the Janissaries, then _Beylerbey_ of Rumelia. In the last\r\ncapacity he attended the sultan in the Persian war of 1548-1549. As a\r\nreward for special services in the war he was made pasha of Egypt in\r\n1549, and at the time of his departure was nominated vizier. Returning\r\nto Constantinople in 1553, he was made third vizier, and upon the\r\ndeath of Rustem in 1561, he became grand vizier. Because of jealousies\r\nand enmities caused by his promotions he had hardly a friend left;\r\nnevertheless, he was able to hold the favor of Suleiman until his death\r\nin 1565.[277]\r\n\r\n\r\nPUNISHMENTS\r\n\r\nThe system did not attempt to rely wholly upon the glittering attractions\r\nof indefinite promotion and enormously increasing wealth. Not all men\r\ncan be allured to remain unswervingly within a narrow path of strict\r\nobedience and whole-hearted service. Pages and _Ajem-oghlans_ were held\r\nto severe discipline by sufficient and certain punishment; but their\r\nteachers and eunuch masters were required to keep that punishment within\r\nbounds by the certainty of yet severer punishment.[278] _Ajem-oghlans_\r\nmight be beaten, or sold out of the sultan’s service. After the close\r\nof the strictly educational period, punishment, like reward, followed\r\ncontinuously the law of proportionate increase. The higher the position,\r\nthe heavier the punishment of being passed over in promotion, or of\r\nbeing actually degraded. Fines and confiscations also grew with rank. At\r\nno great height in the scale, the personal punishments reached that of\r\ndeath, and death was always very near the highest officials. Any tendency\r\ntoward treason or revolt, any act of disobedience, sometimes a plot\r\nagainst a higher official, sometimes even a disagreement with the sultan\r\nin a matter of policy,[279] would lead to sudden execution. The viziers\r\nof Selim I carried their wills in their bosoms; and well they might,\r\nsince the heads of seven are said to have fallen at his command.[280]\r\n\r\nThus was the system carefully kept clear of all the human material\r\nthat seemed to endanger its working or threaten its unity. There was\r\nno sympathy for weakness, no accepting of excuses, no suspension of\r\nsentence, no mercy. Suleiman did not always have the heart to execute\r\npromptly; but in the end he had no alternative, so remorseless was\r\nthe system. Even his best friend, Ibrahim, went too far and had to be\r\nremoved. Two of his sons, the oldest and ablest, threatened the system\r\nin turn, and one after the other suffered the bow-string. Small wonder\r\nthat Suleiman’s soul was not filled with joy at the victory of Jerbé.\r\n“Those who saw Solyman’s face in this hour of triumph,” says Busbecq,\r\n“failed to detect in it the slightest trace of undue elation. I can\r\nmyself positively declare, that when I saw him two days later on his way\r\nto the mosque, the expression of his countenance was unchanged; his stern\r\nfeatures had lost nothing of their habitual gloom; one would have thought\r\nthat the victory concerned him not, and that this startling success of\r\nhis arms had caused him no surprise. So self-contained was the heart of\r\nthat grand old man, so schooled to meet each change of fortune however\r\ngreat, that all the applause and triumph of that day wrung from him no\r\nsign of satisfaction.”[281] Arbiter of the destinies of so many men,\r\ncompelled to be remorseless as fate, Suleiman could allow joy no place in\r\nhis soul. He who wielded as severe a rod as ever man held must maintain\r\nover himself the sternest discipline of all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE RULING INSTITUTION: AS AN ARMY\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MILITARY ASPECT\r\n\r\nThe Ottoman government had been an army before it was anything else.\r\nLike the Turkish nations of the steppe lands, the Ottoman nation was\r\n“born of war and organized for conquest.”[282] Fighting was originally\r\nthe first business of the state and governing the second. As time went\r\non, and particularly after the capture of Constantinople, the necessity\r\nof administering immense territories transferred the preponderance to\r\nthe governmental aspect; but even in Suleiman’s time the two great\r\nfunctions of the Ruling Institution were very closely united. War\r\ncarried practically the whole government into the field.[283] Of course\r\nsubstitute officials had to be left behind to attend to what public\r\nbusiness was absolutely necessary, but these were paralleled by, and\r\nindeed were usually identical with, the officers and soldiers who had to\r\nbe left behind to preserve public order. So completely was the government\r\nan army, that the more important judges, who did not belong directly\r\nto the Ruling Institution, were taken into the field. Suleiman on his\r\nlast campaign had 48,316 men under pay.[284] Acceptance of the sultan’s\r\npay by ordinary usage signified that the recipient was a _kul_.[285]\r\nEvidently, then, almost the entire personnel of the Ruling Institution,\r\nexcept the younger pages and the _Ajem-oghlans_ who were as yet unfit,\r\naccompanied the master to war.[286] In fact, army and government were\r\none. War was the external purpose, government the internal purpose, of\r\none institution, composed of one body of men. On the military side,\r\nthis institution carried on war abroad, repressed revolt at home, kept\r\nitself in power, and preserved sufficient order in the empire to allow\r\na busy and varied economic and social activity. On the governmental\r\nside, it supplied itself with funds, regulated its own workings,—which\r\nwas no small task,—kept the operations of the other institutions of the\r\nempire in order, and enforced the law. The high officials of government\r\nheld high command in war. The generals of the army had extensive\r\nadministrative duties in regard to the affairs of the troops under them,\r\nthe management of departments of state, or the government of provinces.\r\n\r\nThe scope of the present treatise confines the discussion of the\r\nRuling Institution as an army to those features which lie nearest the\r\ngovernmental aspect. The great majority of its members constituted the\r\nstanding army of the empire, in the two great sections of Janissaries,\r\nor infantry, and _Spahis_ of the Porte, or cavalry. Subordinate sections\r\ncared for the artillery and transport services, and for other necessary\r\nadjuncts to campaigning. Although the feudal _Spahis_ did not receive pay\r\nfrom the sultan, and hence were not properly _kullar_, their officers\r\nwere his slaves, even though many of them were supported during their\r\nterm of service from fiefs. Besides these regular troops there were\r\nalso attached to the Ottoman army certain irregular bodies of a lower\r\norder,—the _Akinji_, the _Azabs_, the Kurds, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JANISSARIES[287]\r\n\r\nThe body of regular infantry known as _Yenicheri_, or “new troops,” a\r\nname which the West has changed to Janissaries, comes near to standing\r\nin the Western imagination for the sultan’s entire slave-family.[288]\r\nIn the sixteenth century, however, it formed not more than a fourth of\r\nthe whole number; nor does its importance seem to have been beyond its\r\nnumerical proportion, except in one or two respects. Since its members\r\nwere physically trained beyond comparison with their intellectual\r\neducation, since they were kept in poverty and hence were comparatively\r\nirresponsible, and since a large portion of them were in comparative\r\nidleness in time of peace, they were liable to act as an organized and\r\nvery dangerous mob. They might start a riot on short notice, or burn a\r\nsection of the city in order to pillage the neighboring houses, or rifle\r\nthe shops of the Jews, or plunder the grand vizier’s establishment.[289]\r\nThey could not easily be restrained from plundering cities which had\r\ncapitulated or from violating terms of surrender.[290] They felt that\r\nthe death of a sultan gave them an interregnum of license before the\r\naccession of a new sovereign.[291] They demanded donatives at the\r\nsuccession of a new ruler with such increasing rapacity as to embarrass\r\nthe treasury;[292] and they needed to be braced at critical moments\r\nby liberal presents.[293] In time of battle, however, they drew up an\r\ninvincible line behind which the person of their sovereign was as safe as\r\nin an impregnable fortress. Their devotion to his person was the greater\r\nbecause they were in a special sense his _kullar_, and because he was one\r\nof them, being inscribed in one of their _odas_ and receiving his pay\r\nregularly.[294] In small groups on garrison duty their severe training\r\nseems to have made of them an efficient police.[295] Yet their _esprit de\r\ncorps_, resting on consciousness of power, made them feared at all times.\r\nThey took an active part in determining the destinies of the empire in\r\ntwo ways,—by limiting conquests, and by influencing the succession to\r\nthe throne.[296] They compelled the mighty Selim to turn back from both\r\nPersia and Egypt.[297] They murmured before Vienna, and without doubt\r\nhastened the raising of the siege.[298]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUCCESSION TO THE THRONE\r\n\r\nThe Janissaries had no small influence in determining the succession to\r\nthe throne.[299] There was no law fixing the succession, since neither\r\nthe _Sheri_ nor the _Kanuns_ provided for such things;[300] but it was\r\na matter of fundamental custom that a prince of the house of Osman\r\nshould rule, and it was almost as fundamental that a son of a sultan\r\nshould succeed him. Not until 1617 was the present rule established, by\r\nwhich the oldest male of the royal house is heir apparent.[301] Before\r\nthat, when a sultan had several sons, the eldest had no inherent right\r\nto succeed, as is the practice in Western Europe. The Turkish father\r\nnaturally desired to choose which of his sons should follow him; and to\r\nthis end, when he gave them provincial governments, he often placed the\r\nfavorite nearest the capital. After Mohammed II had issued his famous\r\n_Kanun_, by which the son who reached the throne was legally authorized\r\nto execute his brothers,[302] a situation of unstable equilibrium arose\r\nas soon as the sons of a sultan began to grow up. Each knew that he must\r\neither obtain the throne or die soon after his father; hence revolt\r\nwas almost forced upon a son who found himself placed farther from the\r\ncapital than a favored brother. When Bayezid II grew old and feeble, his\r\nactive and warlike son Selim opposed his wish to leave the empire to\r\nAchmet;[303] in the end Selim triumphed, and Bayezid, forced to abdicate,\r\nmet a death that was believed by many not to have been natural.[304]\r\nThe Janissaries turned the scale in this struggle, and henceforth they\r\nwere felt to be a dangerous element whenever a sultan came to have more\r\nthan one grown son. They had a great part in the death of both Mustapha\r\nand Bayezid, the ablest sons of Suleiman; indeed, their sympathy for\r\nthe former was undoubtedly a chief reason in determining Suleiman to\r\nexecute him, since only thus could his own safety be assured.[305] In\r\nthe case of Bayezid, the fact that the Janissaries did not support him\r\nspelled his doom, even though his father, beyond all precedent, pardoned\r\nhis first revolt, and though the influence of his mother Roxelana was\r\nstrong in his favor.[306] Speculation is dangerous; but the Janissaries\r\nmay have done Western Europe a great service on these occasions. Had\r\neither Mustapha or Bayezid come to the throne instead of the drunken and\r\ndissolute Selim II, the issue of Lepanto might have been different, a new\r\nexpedition against Vienna led by a vigorous and idolized young monarch\r\nmight have succeeded, the Ottoman power might have ruled more widely and\r\npermanently than it did, and the decay of the Ruling Institution might\r\nhave been long postponed.[307]\r\n\r\nThe Janissaries in Suleiman’s time numbered between twelve and fourteen\r\nthousand;[308] and this number probably did not include the garrison\r\nwhich supported the power of the empire in Egypt,[309] still less that\r\nwhich upheld the corsair rule in North Africa. Except in time of war many\r\nof the Janissaries were distributed in garrisons, so that probably not\r\nmore than half resided in the capital.[310] Such of these as were married\r\nlived at home, and the others were lodged in two great barracks.[311]\r\nThey were organized in messes of ten; ten messes constituted an _orta_\r\nor _oda_, of which there were one hundred and sixty-five in Suleiman’s\r\ntime.[312] Each _orta_ had its officers, who had been promoted from its\r\nranks; and above all the _ortas_ was a graded set of officers, under the\r\n_Agha_, or general, of the Janissaries.[313] This official had never\r\nbeen a Janissary, but had come through the colleges of pages.[314] He\r\nnot merely commanded the Janissaries, but was a sort of minister of war\r\nfor them. Aided by his _Kiaya_, or lieutenant,[315] his chief _Yaziji_,\r\nor scribe, and a bureau of clerks, he directed their enrolment, the\r\ndistribution of their pay, their promotions, their location, the purchase\r\nof their supplies and clothing, and all the other business of the corps.\r\nHe was well paid and was of great authority, outranking all other\r\ngenerals, though on some occasions he was obliged to yield precedence to\r\ntwo of the generals of cavalry, whose corps were older than those of the\r\nJanissaries.[316]\r\n\r\nThe Janissaries had a regular ladder of promotion through the offices of\r\ntheir _odas_ and above, as far as the position of _Segban-bashi_, which\r\nwas the office next below that of _Agha_.[317] One hundred and fifty of\r\ntheir best bowmen were honored by being detailed to accompany the sultan\r\non the march, as his _Solaks_.[318] They might also for distinguished\r\nability or service be taken into the regular cavalry, and have all its\r\nopportunities open to them. No less than the rest of the army, they kept\r\nmarvellous order in camp, and, except at the crises above described, were\r\ncompletely obedient to their officers.[319] They were punishable only by\r\ntheir own officers, not even the grand vizier having direct jurisdiction\r\nover them.[320] They had a strong sense of maintaining their privileges\r\nand what they considered to be their rights. Busbecq, who gives\r\nillumination at so many points, shows how the grand vizier Rustem, and\r\neven Suleiman himself, felt toward these men when they were all together\r\nand their blood was hot. On one occasion Busbecq’s servants quarreled\r\nwith some Janissaries, and he was disposed to back his men up; whereupon\r\nRustem sent a trusty messenger to him with a verbal message, asking\r\nhim “to remove every cause of offence which might occasion a quarrel\r\nwith those atrocious scoundrels. Was I not aware,” he asked, “that it\r\nwas war time, when they were masters, so that not even Solyman himself\r\nhad control over them, and was actually himself afraid of receiving\r\nviolence at their hands?”[321] Great care had to be taken to keep the\r\nJanissaries under control, for they were capable of wrecking the whole\r\ngovernment. They were, to be sure, constantly drained of their ablest\r\nmen by promotion; but this only left the others the more liable, like\r\nsheep, to follow a new leader into evil. They could be repressed more or\r\nless by punishment: now and then an especially active promoter of trouble\r\nwas executed;[322] officers who offended were sometimes sent to command\r\ndistant garrisons, and sometimes they were stricken from the roll.[323]\r\nSuleiman succeeded, on the whole, in keeping the Janissaries in hand, and\r\nhe was able to lead them farther east than could his father Selim. They\r\nnever revolted against him,[324] and they supported him against Bayezid.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPAHIS OF THE PORTE[325]\r\n\r\nThe regular cavalry were all included under the general name of _Spahis_,\r\nor horsemen; but the name was also applied to one of the four divisions\r\ninto which Osman’s corps of daring riders had been organized after the\r\nmodel of the cavalry of the caliph Omar I.[326] Their organization\r\nwas older than that of the Janissaries; it had come down continuously\r\nfrom the early days.[327] The members were not organized into a single\r\nbody, they had high pay, and they were in the presence of excellent\r\nopportunities to acquire wealth and to rise with rapidity. Accordingly,\r\nthey appear never to have caused Suleiman any special trouble.[328]\r\n\r\nThe four corps were the _Spahis_ in the narrower sense, often called\r\n_Spahi-Oghlans_; the _Silihdars_, or weapon-bearers; the _Ulufajis_,\r\nor paid troops, in two divisions, the left and the right; and the\r\n_Ghurebas_, or Foreign Legion, also in two divisions, the left and the\r\nright.[329] The _Spahis_ were most honored and best paid, but each\r\nhad to bring with him to war five or six armed slaves on horseback.\r\nThe _Silihdars_ had less pay and furnished four or five horsemen. The\r\n_Ulufajis_ furnished two or three horsemen each.[330] These three corps\r\nwere recruited from the pages and the Janissaries, the _Ulufajis_\r\nreceiving also occasional members by special promotions from the\r\nirregular troops.[331] The Foreign Legion had least pay of all, and its\r\nmembers came alone; not having begun as the sultan’s _kullar_, and often\r\nnot even as Ottomans, they enjoyed small honor.[332] Each of the first\r\ntwo corps, and each division of the last two corps of the _Spahis_ of the\r\nPorte, was organized separately after the fashion of the Janissaries,\r\nwith its own general, who supervised the administration of all its\r\naffairs.[333] The number of the _Spahis_ of the Porte is given on two\r\nbases. In Suleiman’s time the actual members of the four corps counted\r\nfrom ten to twelve thousand men, or a little less than the number of the\r\nJanissaries;[334] but, since most of them had each to bring from two to\r\nsix additional horsemen, the total force which they assembled was from\r\nforty to fifty thousand.[335] Whether the entire number or only the\r\nactual members were regularly considered to be the sultan’s _kullar_,\r\nunder his pay, does not appear clearly. Probably he did not pay the\r\nadditional horsemen directly; for strictly speaking, they were _kullar_\r\nof his _kullar_. In time of battle all the regular troops, _Spahis_ and\r\nJanissaries alike, were drawn up to protect the sultan, the Janissaries\r\nbeing aligned in front, the _Spahis_ proper on the right, the _Silihdars_\r\non the left, and the _Ulufajis_ and _Ghurebas_ in the rear.[336]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEUDAL SPAHIS[337]\r\n\r\nOutside the towns the greater part of the European dominions of the\r\nsultan, and a large part of Asia Minor, were granted in fief to Moslems\r\nwho were for the most part not _kullar_ of the sultan.[338] They\r\ndeserve to be considered in a discussion of the government, however,\r\nnot only because they collected the revenues and exercised seigniorial\r\njurisdiction in their estates,[339] but also because they were officered\r\nby the sultan’s _kullar_. The estates were of different sizes and were\r\nreckoned in three classes: _timars_, when the yearly revenue was under\r\ntwenty thousand aspers; _ziamets_, when it was twenty thousand to one\r\nhundred thousand aspers; _khasses_, when it was over one hundred\r\nthousand aspers.[340] _Timars_ might be united into a _ziamet_, but\r\n_ziamets_ could not be divided.[341] Every fief-holder must appear in\r\nperson when summoned to war. If the annual income of a _Timarji_, or\r\nTimariote, reached six thousand aspers, he must bring with him an armed\r\nhorseman; and he must bring another for each additional three thousand\r\naspers of his revenue. The holder of a larger fief must bring with him\r\nan armed horseman if his income amounted to ten thousand aspers, and\r\nanother horseman for each additional five thousand aspers of income.[342]\r\nIn the sixteenth century this service was strictly exacted, and the\r\nfief-holders were held to residence on their estates. The principle\r\nof heredity entered into the distribution of these estates, but under\r\nlimitations. One son of the holder of a small fief had a right to the\r\nfief;[343] not more than three sons of the holder of a large fief were\r\nentitled to small fiefs.[344] The sons of _kullar_ in high position might\r\nreceive fiefs large in proportion to the rank of their father;[345] by\r\nthis means they were honorably conveyed from the ruling Institution into\r\nthe Moslem population. The _Zaims_ and Timariotes, as the holders of\r\nthe corresponding fiefs were named, were a class of country gentlemen,\r\nhonest, sober, true to the Moslem faith and to the sultan, better in\r\nmorals than the _kullar_ if not so able of intellect, the substantial\r\nmiddle class of the empire, ancestors of those who today give hope that\r\nTurkey may become a modern nation. It was these who gave the first\r\ntraining to the _Ajem-oghlans_, starting them well on the road from\r\nChristianity to Islam, and preparing them to become members of the\r\nOttoman nation.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Suleiman the system of fiefs had become greatly\r\ndisarranged.[346] The distribution of them had been left to the local\r\ngovernors, and corruption had crept in; the frequent wars also had led\r\nto rapid changes and consequent confusion. Moreover, the army always\r\ncontained a large number of _Gonnullu_, or volunteers, who came at their\r\nown expense, and fought with the hope, often realized, of receiving the\r\nfiefs of slain men as the reward of signally brave conduct.[347] It is\r\nsaid that during the course of a single bloody day one fief changed\r\nowners seven times. If fiefs might thus be granted in the midst of\r\nbattle, it is not easy to see how a condition of reasonable order could\r\nhave been preserved in the feudal system. Suleiman, therefore, by a\r\n_Kanun_ of the year 1530, attached the granting of all fiefs above a\r\ncertain size once more to the central government.[348] Each holder of\r\nsuch a fief must obtain a _teskereh_, or document, from Constantinople,\r\nin order to have good title.[349] The central treasury administered such\r\nestates during vacancies. Only those fief-holders who held by _teskereh_\r\nwere entitled to be called _Spahis_;[350] the others were known as\r\n_Timarjis_, or Timariotes. The feudal _Spahis_ of Anatolia were more\r\nunder the authority of the governor than were those of Europe; they were\r\nnot so well paid, did not have so much practice in fighting, and were not\r\nso highly esteemed as soldiers.[351]\r\n\r\nThus the country gentry were kept under good control; the accumulation\r\nof estates was prevented, any tendency toward independence could easily\r\nbe thwarted, and the sultan obtained regularly the service for which the\r\nlands were granted. In addition, most of the subject Christian population\r\nwas governed locally without any trouble to the sultan, and was held\r\ndown well and uniformly by resident seigneurs. A great advantage of the\r\nsystem was that, by the granting of new fiefs in newly-conquered lands,\r\nthe territorial army was automatically increased in proportion to the\r\nincrease of the empire.[352]\r\n\r\n\r\nOFFICERS OF THE FEUDAL SPAHIS\r\n\r\nLocal government and the command of the feudal _Spahis_ was cared for\r\nby officials who belonged to the sultan’s great slave-family, and who\r\nbrought with them to their posts a number, proportioned to their rank,\r\nof _Spahis_ of the Porte, pages, _Ajem-oghlans_, and slaves of their\r\nown. The lowest of these officers were the _Subashis_, or captains, who\r\nwere in time of peace governors of towns, with enough Janissaries and\r\n_Azabs_, or irregular infantry, to police the locality.[353] Next above\r\nthese were the _Alai Beys_, or colonels, who in time of peace were ready\r\nwith a company of from two hundred to five hundred troops to pass from\r\nplace to place as there might be need.[354] Above these again were the\r\n_Sanjak Beys_, who governed important cities and held superior rule over\r\na number of towns and the district in which they lay.[355] Finally, in\r\nthe Balkan Peninsula and in Western Asia Minor there was from of old a\r\n_Beylerbey_, who had authority over all the _Beys_ of his region. Incomes\r\nwere provided by the assignment of fiefs proportioned in size to each\r\nofficer’s importance.[356] All of these officers of local government\r\nhad a sufficient staff of lieutenants, treasurers, book-keepers and\r\nclerks.[357] The _Beylerbey_ of Rumelia resided in time of peace at\r\nConstantinople. The _Beylerbey_ of Anatolia seems to have spent much time\r\nin his dominions,[358] though undoubtedly he was often at the capital,\r\nsince he had his regular place in the Divan.\r\n\r\nIn time of war this official scheme, detached from its function of local\r\ngovernment, drew together the feudal _Spahis_, section by section, into a\r\nperfectly organized territorial army for each of the two regions. Notice\r\nof time and place was sent round, and within a month every man called had\r\njoined his proper standard.[359] After uniting with the sultan’s regular\r\narmy, the army of Rumelia under its _Beylerbey_ had the right of the\r\nbattle-line when fighting in Europe, and the army of Anatolia under its\r\n_Beylerbey_ had the right of the line when fighting in Asia.[360] The\r\nenrolled feudal troops of Europe numbered about fifty thousand, and those\r\nof Asia, including Anatolia, Karamania, Amasia, and Avandole, thirty\r\nthousand.[361] In each case the number should be doubled or tripled to\r\nallow for the additional horsemen which all the _Spahis_ were required to\r\nbring.[362] On the other hand, a considerable proportion of the feudal\r\ntroops, sometimes estimated at one-half,[363] remained on duty at home\r\nin time of war to protect the provinces and prevent uprisings. The feudal\r\ntroops, while brave, eager, and regardless of their lives, had not the\r\nphysical strength nor the practice of fighting in squadrons which the\r\nregular troops had, and hence were not their equals.\r\n\r\nThe _Beylerbeys_ of Rumelia and Anatolia were called out with their\r\ntroops for every campaign. The eight other _Beylerbeys_ of Suleiman’s\r\ntime,—those of Karamania, Amasia, Avandole, Syria, Mesopotamia, Egypt,\r\nHungary,[364] and Temesvar,[365]—who had fewer feudal troops at command\r\nand more need of them at home, were summoned only when the war was in\r\ntheir region.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER BODIES OF TROOPS\r\n\r\nThere were three principal bodies of irregular troops, the _Akinji_ or\r\ncavalry, the _Azabs_ or infantry, and the Kurds; besides various smaller\r\ngroups, such as the descendants of the ancient corps of _Yayas_ and\r\n_Mosellems_, who held fiefs of a sort in the oldest _sanjaks_ of the\r\nempire, and the _Deli_ or “crazy” company of scouts.[366] The _Akinji_\r\nnumbered perhaps thirty thousand in time of peace and were mainly near\r\nthe European frontier, where they made a living by raiding. They received\r\nno pay either in peace or in war, but gathered booty and slaves and hoped\r\nfor promotion.[367] The _Azabs_ numbered perhaps ten thousand in peace\r\nand forty thousand in war.[368] Some of them served in the garrisons and\r\nsome with the fleet.[369] The number of the _Akinjis_ and _Azabs_ was\r\ngreatly augmented in time of war by the addition of volunteers, many of\r\nwhom were criminals and ruffians.[370] The irregular troops were the\r\nterror of the invaded lands in war time; for the regular army was held\r\nunder iron discipline, but these irresponsible creatures carried fire,\r\nrapine, and sword over wide areas of country. In time of siege and battle\r\nthe _Azabs_ were sent forward to break the charge of the enemy, or to\r\naid in filling the moats by their own bodies.[371] Such as lived were\r\nrewarded generously; the rest were believed to pass at once by a martyr’s\r\ndeath to heavenly reward.[372] The Kurds lay near the Persian frontier\r\nto the number of about thirty thousand. Individuals among the _Akinji_,\r\n_Azabs_, and Kurds might hope to become gentlemen through distinguished\r\nbravery, by being made _Ulufajis_ among the _Spahis_ of the Porte.[373]\r\n\r\nAttached to the regular army there were also various auxiliary corps of\r\narmorers, cannoneers, men of transport service, musicians, commissaries,\r\nand the like, to the number of three or four thousand in all.[374] The\r\nTartars of the Crimea, and the Moldavians and Wallachians, were also\r\nobliged to furnish contingents.[375] All told, the enrolled strength of\r\nthe entire army was something more or less than two hundred thousand\r\nmen. But, since the _Spahis_ were required to bring other fighting men\r\nwith them in proportion to their revenues, since numerous slaves and\r\nprivate servants accompanied the soldiers, and since the feudal and\r\nirregular troops were joined by great numbers of volunteers, both horse\r\nand foot, high and low, the complete army for the greatest expeditions\r\nprobably numbered about three hundred thousand men.[376] At the close of\r\nSuleiman’s reign the paid nucleus was about fifty thousand strong; the\r\nfeudal _Spahis_ for a European campaign numbered about sixty thousand,\r\nwith perhaps a like number of helpers. The remaining troops were of no\r\ngreat value in battle, unless to break the first shock of the enemy’s\r\ncharge. They served chiefly to lay waste the hostile country and to\r\ngather booty and slaves.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCIPLINE AND ARDOR\r\n\r\nContemporary observers were strongly impressed with the wonderful\r\ndiscipline and intense zeal for fighting that was seen among the\r\nTurks. The silence, order, and cleanliness of the camps, the absolute\r\nobedience, enforced if need be by severe punishments and executions,\r\nthe submissiveness to long marches, hard labor, and scanty food, the\r\neagerness for battle, the joy in conflict, the recklessness of life,\r\npresented a perfection of discipline, self-control, and single-hearted\r\npurpose that seemed miraculous. A few of the many witnesses may be heard\r\nbriefly:\r\n\r\n“The Turks come together for war as though they had been invited to a\r\nwedding.”[377]\r\n\r\n“The Great Turk is the best obeyed by his subjects of all the lords that\r\nI know.”[378]\r\n\r\n“I think there is no prince in all the world who has his armies and\r\ncamps in better order, both as regards the abundance of victuals and of\r\nall other necessities which are usually provided, and as regards the\r\nbeautiful order and manner they use, in encamping without any confusion\r\nor embarrassment.”[379]\r\n\r\n“Their military discipline has such justice and severity as easily to\r\nsurpass the ancient Greeks and Romans; the Turks surpass our soldiers\r\nfor three reasons: they obey their commanders promptly; they never show\r\nthe least concern for their lives in battle; they can live a long time\r\nwithout bread and wine, content with barley and water.”[380]\r\n\r\n“Peace and silence reign in a Turkish camp.... Such is the result\r\nproduced by military discipline, and the stern laws bequeathed them by\r\ntheir ancestors.”[381]\r\n\r\n“It is marvellous how the force and rigor of justice increase in war....\r\nIf the soldiers rob or beat, the head comes off, or they are so beaten\r\nthat they can never be well again.”[382]\r\n\r\n“They keep the divinest order in the world.”[383]\r\n\r\n“In truth the discipline could not be better, nor the obedience\r\ngreater.”[384]\r\n\r\n“For such as are acquainted with the Histories of the Turkish affaires,\r\nand doe aduisedly looke into the order and course of their proceedinges:\r\ndoe well perceiue, that the chiefest cause of their sodaine and fearefull\r\npuissaunce, hath beene the excellence of their Martial discipline joyned\r\nwith a singular desire and resolution to aduaunce and enlarge both the\r\nbounds of their Empire and the profession of their Religion. The which\r\nwas alwaies accompanied with such notable Policie and prudence, that\r\nthe singularitie of their vertue and good gouernment, hath made their\r\nArmes alwaies fearefull and fortunate, and consequently, hath caused the\r\ngreatnesse of their estate.”[385]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUPREME COMMAND\r\n\r\nThe sultan was commander-in-chief of the entire army, standing, feudal,\r\nand irregular. When the army was summoned for a great campaign, it\r\ngathered about him; on the march and in camp every body of troops had\r\nits place with reference to him;[386] in formation of battle, he was the\r\ncentral point about which the whole vast display was organized. When\r\nthe army was assembled, and then only, the sultan stood forth visibly\r\nand palpably as the head and center of the Ruling Institution and of\r\nthe Ottoman nation upon which it rested. His _kullar_ were gathered\r\nabout him in devotion of body and soul; they were going forth under his\r\nleadership against the infidel or the heretic; they were manifesting the\r\nresults of the long and careful training that he had given them; they\r\nmarched, encamped, and fought under his eye and command; they formed\r\nan honored and privileged nucleus in the midst of a vast, loyal, and\r\nambitious national army; they surrounded and served him as monarch with a\r\nsplendor seen at no other time;[387] with complete apparatus of council,\r\nministry, treasury, and chancery, they carried on his government from\r\nwhatever city, valley, mountain, or plain he might be occupying. Here was\r\nthe Ruling Institution in being, exhibiting in varying degrees all its\r\naspects, revealing its essential unity, enforcing the despotic will of\r\nits master, commander-in-chief, and chief executive.\r\n\r\nThe very greatness and unity of the Ruling Institution as an army was not\r\nwithout serious disadvantages. The power could not wisely be delegated,\r\nand the army could not effectively be divided. At the opening of the\r\ncampaign of 1529 Suleiman issued to Ibrahim a commission as _Seraskier_,\r\nor general of the army, which placed the Ruling Institution, the Moslem\r\nInstitution, the Ottoman nation and all the subject nations under his\r\ncommand. The Sultan’s order ran as follows: “My Viziers, _Beylerbeys_,\r\nJudges of the Army, Jurists, Judges, _Seids_, _Sheiks_, Dignitaries\r\nof the Court and Supports of the Empire, _Sanjak Beys_, Generals of\r\nCavalry or of Infantry, _Alai Beys_, _Subashis_, _Cheribashis_, and all\r\nthe victorious Soldiery great and small, high and low, the Officials\r\nand Appointees, all inhabitants of My kingdoms and lands, the people of\r\ncity and country, rich and poor, distinguished and ordinary, and all\r\nmen are to recognize My above-named Grand Vizier as _Seraskier_ ...\r\nand to consider all that he says and desires as a command from My own\r\nmouth....”[388] This was a delegation of the supreme command of the\r\narmy and all the human military resources of the empire to Ibrahim.\r\nSince Suleiman himself went on this campaign, the supreme command was\r\nnot then exercised apart from the sultan’s presence. Four years later,\r\nhowever, Ibrahim, clothed with the same authority, was sent ahead to\r\nopen the Persian campaign. On the return march he added the title of\r\nSultan to that of _Seraskier_ in issuing his daily orders.[389] Perhaps\r\nhe felt like Pepin the Short, that he who had the power of king should\r\nalso bear the name. But Suleiman was no _roi fainéant_; Ibrahim had\r\ngone too far, the empire could have but one head, and Ibrahim suffered\r\nthe bow-string.[390] Suleiman profited by the experience; he appointed\r\nno more _Seraskiers_ with such exalted powers, but himself led the\r\narmy when it was assembled as a whole. The campaign of Szigeth was the\r\nthirteenth which he directed in person.[391] The precedent of delegating\r\nthe supreme command was, however, a fatal one; for Selim the Sot and\r\nall his successors were to use this method to avoid the exertion of\r\ncampaigning, and from this step was to date the beginning of the empire’s\r\ndownfall.[392] “This so constituted organization had need of two things:\r\nit needed for its animation a man filled himself with a vivid spirit\r\nand free and mighty impulses, and to give it movement and activity it\r\nrequired continual campaigns and progressive conquests; in a word, war\r\nand a warlike chief.”[393] When another than the sultan should become\r\nhead of the Ruling Institution as visibly assembled, and yet be only an\r\nofficial removable at a cloistered monarch’s caprice, the army would lose\r\nthe keystone of its organization, and ere long victory would depart from\r\nits banners.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIVISIBILITY OF THE ARMY\r\n\r\nThe essential oneness of the army, based on the sultan’s ownership of\r\nthe standing body of cavalry and infantry and its attachment to his\r\nperson,[394] and on the incapacity of the territorial armies to carry on\r\ngreat campaigns alone, was also a fact injurious to the Ottoman power.\r\nAt the accession of Selim I, the empire had been nearly identical in\r\nterritory with the Byzantine Empire under the Macedonian dynasty. No\r\ngreat power had marched with it. The conquests of Selim in the East\r\nand of Suleiman in Hungary had pushed the frontiers to the borders of\r\ntwo great powers: Persia on the east and Austria on the west remained\r\nhenceforth constantly hostile in feeling and often hostile in fact to the\r\nOttoman Empire.[395] They were so far away from the Ottoman capital that\r\nthe road to either was a journey of months for the army, and relations\r\nwith both were often disturbed at the same time; but there was only\r\none great army, and there could be only one serious war. If, while war\r\nwas in progress on one frontier, conditions became intolerable on the\r\nother, it was necessary to make peace on what terms could be had, and\r\ncarry the army to the other extremity of the empire. Thus, Suleiman and\r\nIbrahim concluded the peace of 1533 with Charles and Ferdinand, in order\r\nto be free to proceed against Persia at once;[396] and thus Suleiman\r\nwas obliged to arrange terms with Ferdinand in 1547, in order to march\r\nagainst Persia in 1548.[397] Had a Cardinal Cesarini absolved Charles and\r\nFerdinand from either treaty, and had they been able to act, they could\r\nhave marched to Constantinople in 1534, 1535, or 1548 against practically\r\nno resistance.[398] On the other hand, had the Ottoman standing army been\r\ndivisible, and separable from the person of the monarch, the Sultan could\r\nhave kept a steady pressure at both frontiers; and by taking advantage\r\nof opportunities he might have conquered far to the west and north, and\r\nrealized his ambition of adding all the heretical Persian dominions to\r\nhis empire so as to reach the Chinese frontier, and of sending the\r\nhorsetail standards to the Atlantic shore of North Africa.[399] Or\r\nhe might have carried out the intention expressed through Ibrahim in\r\n1533—which was quite in keeping with his character—of aiding the Emperor\r\nCharles V to enforce unity of religious belief upon the Protestants and\r\nthe pope.[400] It is interesting to notice that Austria possessed two\r\ngreat advantages over Persia in the wars with Turkey. The Ottomans did\r\nnot wish to pass the winter in the cold north, but they did not object\r\nseriously to staying in Aleppo or Bagdad. This attitude probably saved\r\nVienna for Austria and lost Bagdad for Persia. Again, since the journey\r\nfrom Vienna to Constantinople was much easier than that from Tabriz to\r\nConstantinople, the Austrians could have reached Constantinople while\r\nthe Ottoman army was in the East, whereas the Persians could not have\r\nreached Constantinople while the Ottomans were in Austria. This advantage\r\nremained theoretical, however, in Suleiman’s time, since neither Austria\r\nnor Persia was ever able to attempt invasion.\r\n\r\nThus the inherent character of the Ottoman Ruling Institution, as a\r\nsingle magnificent army united under the supreme command of the sultan,\r\nmade the institution incapable of adaptation to an indefinitely expanding\r\nempire, and so set bounds, certain as those of fate, to Ottoman conquest.\r\nThe sultan had but one arm; it was a long arm and a strong one, yet it\r\ncould reach only a fixed distance, and it could strike but one blow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE RULING INSTITUTION: AS A NOBILITY AND A COURT\r\n\r\n\r\nI. PRIVILEGES OF THE KULLAR\r\n\r\nNo disgrace was attached to the condition of being the sultan’s slave;\r\non the contrary, the title of _kul_ was felt to be an honor. Boys longed\r\nto bear it.[401] No one who had it desired to be rid of it. It carried\r\nmarked distinction and secured deference everywhere. Those who revealed\r\nby their costume, bearing, or assertion that they were the sultan’s\r\nproperty were treated with the consideration always granted in monarchies\r\nto property and persons closely related to the sovereign.\r\n\r\nThis honor shown to the _kullar_ rested, however, on no mere servile\r\nattachment to the sultan and on no mere fear of an Oriental despot. The\r\nsultan’s slaves from lowest to highest were set off from his subjects\r\nby a distinct set of privileges which in Western minds were associated\r\nonly with nobility. Besides a general protection over them all by means\r\nof careful registration and watchful organization, the sultan bestowed\r\nupon all his _kullar_ the personal rights of immunity from taxation,[402]\r\nand responsibility to none but their own officials and courts and to\r\nhim.[403] At the same time he freed them all from anxiety about the\r\nnecessities of life, and enabled most of them to enjoy its luxuries, by\r\nregular pay from his treasury, or, in the case of some high officials,\r\nby revenues from ample estates. In return for these privileges they\r\nwere all sternly required to render him honorable service, usually of\r\na military character. This service was not always of a character that\r\nthe West considered honorable. The labors of the _Ajem-oghlans_, and\r\nthe foot service of the Janissaries and auxiliary corps were not noble\r\nin Christian feudalism, which knew no implements but sword and spear\r\nand fought from the back of a horse. But these humble slaves of the\r\nsultan possessed the same privileges as the highest, and any service was\r\nhonorable which would make their muscles stronger for fighting and teach\r\nthem to contribute to the sultan’s military undertakings on sea and land.\r\nAll members of the sultan’s family were supposed to use their income in\r\nstrengthening his military forces. Janissaries had pay for themselves\r\nalone. _Ghurebas_ had only enough to keep themselves and one horse for\r\neach man. Other _Spahis_ of the Porte brought additional horsemen in\r\naccordance with their pay. Higher officials were expected to support\r\narmed households large in proportion to their revenues. After the model\r\nof the sultan’s household, every _kul_ according to his means built up a\r\nmilitary establishment which followed him and his master to war.\r\n\r\nImmunity from taxation grew naturally out of the slave status. There\r\nwould be no advantage to the sultan in exacting taxes from persons\r\nwhom he supported and who were supposed to devote all their energies\r\nto his service and use all their income for him. As long as the Ruling\r\nInstitution was kept firmly to its purpose, pressure was applied, not\r\nso that successful _kullar_ would surrender part of their income to the\r\nmaster, but so that they would bring as large a contingent as possible\r\nto fight his battles. Suleiman’s grand vizier, Rustem, following a\r\nlong-disused precedent of the time of Bayezid I,[404]—a reign which\r\nhad in various ways foreshadowed later evils,—established a tax upon\r\nthe greater offices of the empire;[405] but, since the sultan did not\r\nreceive the whole of such charges, the custom amounted to the sale of\r\noffices. Not only was such a practice out of harmony with the theory\r\nof the Ruling Institution, but it proved very injurious in operation,\r\nand was rightly accounted one of the causes of the decay of the empire.\r\nThe sultan took pay at the granting of an office, and so presently did\r\nevery official from the men under him; until in time the practice became\r\nso systematized that a regular tariff was arranged and brought into\r\nuse on the occasion of every appointment.[406] Those who thus were put\r\nto great expense on coming into office felt the necessity of recouping\r\nthemselves by whatever means lay in their power.[407] Hence arose not\r\nmerely oppression of the sultan’s subjects, both Christian and Moslem,\r\nbut also a partial recovery of losses at the expense of the sultan\r\nhimself. His servants were forced to devote to personal affairs a large\r\npart of the attention that should have been all his, and to curtail by\r\nvarious devices the contingent which they furnished for his military\r\nservice. When the members of the Ruling Institution began to prey upon\r\neach other, the grand vizier, on behalf of the sultan, taking the lead,\r\nthe solidarity of the institution began to be broken. It may be true\r\nthat in the West, as Montesquieu said, the honor of a monarchy was not\r\ninconsistent with the sale of office;[408] but in the Ottoman Empire it\r\nopened the door to fatal corruption.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Ruling Institution had not always had their own\r\nsystem of justice; they had long been under the jurisdiction of the\r\nordinary Moslem courts. This had led to an essential difficulty; the\r\nordinary courts were part of another institution and were recruited in a\r\nwholly different way; their judges had risen through a rival system of\r\neducation, and were men of letters rather than men of war; the favored\r\n_kullar_ of the sultan had, therefore, come to feel averse to obeying\r\nthem.[409] Accordingly, Bayezid II had ordered that the members of his\r\nfamily should be judged by their own officers.[410] This was a radical\r\nchange; for it brought into prominence the distinction between the two\r\ninstitutions, and had the further effect of setting off the _kullar_\r\nfrom all the rest of the population of the empire, and of constituting\r\nthem almost a separate nationality. Their position became one greatly\r\nto be desired. The Moslem-born population came to feel that somewhere\r\nthere was a great injustice. They whose ancestors had shed their blood\r\nfor the faith were, in the lands which their fathers had conquered,\r\ndenied admittance to the class which not only filled most of the offices\r\nof army and state but enjoyed high privileges. Sons of the conquered\r\ninhabitants, infidel-born, might alone become nobles, paid by the state\r\nrather than contributing to its expenses, not subject to the judges\r\ntrained from boyhood in the Sacred Law; while their own Moslem sons were\r\nrigidly excluded from the honored class, were obliged to bear a part in\r\nthe burdens of the state with small hope of sharing its glory, and were\r\nexpected to take their chances before the same courts to which Christians\r\nand Jews were brought for civil and criminal cases. The very extent of\r\nthe privileges of the _kullar_ made toward the break-down of the system.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOBILITY NOT HEREDITARY\r\n\r\nThe privileges of the sultan’s _kullar_ fell short of those of Western\r\nnobility in one very important respect, namely, that they could not\r\nnormally be handed on to the descendants and heirs of those privileged.\r\nThis exception is so important that various Western writers have affirmed\r\nthat the Turks had no nobles.[411] As the word is used in this treatise,\r\nheredity is not regarded as of the essence of nobility; the latter is\r\nconsidered to lie in the possession of special personal privilege,\r\nrecognized in the structure of the state.\r\n\r\nIn the early Ottoman days, several of the high offices of state became\r\nthe appanages of particular families. The family of Kara Khalil\r\nChendereli held the office of grand vizier continuously for a century,\r\nand furnished an occupant of the office at a later date.[412] The\r\ndescendants of Michael of the Pointed Beard led the _Akinjis_ until\r\nthe time of the first siege of Vienna.[413] The family of Samsamat\r\nChaush held the office of master of ceremonies for generations.[414] A\r\ndescendant of the thirteenth-century poet Jelal ad-din Rumi held office\r\nunder Suleiman.[415] Some writers of the early sixteenth century said\r\nthat, whereas Osman had been aided in winning his dominions by two Greek\r\nrenegades, Michael of the Pointed Beard, and Malco, and by Aurami or\r\nEurcasi, a Turk, he had promised that he would “never put hand in their\r\nblood or fail to give them a magistracy.”[416] The promise had been kept,\r\nand in 1537 one of the Michaloglou was _Sanjak_ in Bosnia and one of the\r\nMalcosoglou was _Sanjak_ in Greece. The other family was then extinct. It\r\nis said that these were considered to be of royal blood, and that in case\r\nof failure in the line of Osman the succession to the throne would fall\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nApart from these few exceptions, the principle of heredity in office\r\nhad been excluded from the Ottoman system by the time of Suleiman. The\r\nOttomans, by old Turkish rule probably derived from the Chinese, knew\r\nno nobility apart from office and public service. An exception was\r\nintroduced by Islam in the case of _Seids_, or _Emirs_, descendants\r\nof the Prophet; but this modification the Ottomans did not wholly\r\nrespect.[417] Accordingly, Ottoman nobility became official,[418]\r\npersonal, and without hereditary quality. It was, in fact, the reverse of\r\nhereditary, since nobility in the father was an actual hindrance to the\r\nson and to all his descendants. But the _kullar_ were not the only class\r\nin the Ottoman Empire which enjoyed official, personal nobility. The\r\nmembers of the Moslem Institution were also exempt from taxation, were\r\nsupported out of public revenues, and were left in enjoyment of their own\r\ngovernment as a part of their general jurisdiction in the empire. They\r\nhad an advantage over the _kullar_ in that their property was not subject\r\nto confiscation. Their position will be discussed later.[419]\r\n\r\nIn the program of the Ruling Institution the policy of avoiding heredity\r\nof nobility fitted in exactly with the slave system, the educational\r\nscheme, and the army arrangements; for the knowledge that every man\r\nwas considered to be “his own ancestry,” and that increased honor and\r\nprivilege depended on achievement alone, made every ambitious member a\r\ndevoted slave, an indefatigable learner, and a dauntless warrior. The\r\nreasons for this policy, the method of applying it by advancement through\r\nmerit, and the vivid impression which it made on thoughtful Western\r\nobservers have been described already;[420] but for its observance an\r\nadditional reason of great weight may be mentioned. Not only did it\r\nprevent the accumulation of property and power in the hands of the\r\nmembers of one family, but it allowed no influence to become intrenched\r\nin the offices of central and local government. No _Beylerbey_ or _Sanjak\r\nBey_ could hope to rebel successfully. All were “but strangers and\r\nforeigners in the countries they ruled,”[421] and held their positions\r\nby the most insecure tenure. The Ottoman Empire was not destined to go\r\nthe way of that of Charlemagne or of the Seljuk Turks. Whatever decay it\r\nmight undergo, it could not break up into small independent states under\r\nofficials who had converted their governorships into sovereignties, so\r\nlong as its two great institutions were maintained consistently.[422]\r\n\r\nAgainst this policy two main tendencies conspired, both based on “human\r\nnature,” the strife of favor against merit, and the desire of the\r\nexcluded to share in privilege. The first was liable to disturb the order\r\nof promotion, the second to open the system to the sons and descendants\r\nof the officials and to other Moslems. No one but Selim the Grim was\r\nfitted to maintain the policy rigidly against such pressure. Suleiman\r\nyielded a little on the first point, in such matters as the promotion of\r\nIbrahim and Rustem;[423] and the second began in his time to gain ground\r\nat the bottom, by the admission of sons of Janissaries to the ranks of\r\nthe _Ajem-oghlans_. Within a generation after his death, however, the\r\nflood-gates were to be opened.[424] The body of Janissaries and the body\r\nof _Spahis_ of the Porte were gradually but swiftly to be made Moslem\r\nand so cut off from the Ruling Institution; the age at which the pages\r\npassed out of the palace was to be postponed; and in time the divided\r\nRuling Institution was to cease to be the admiration of the West and was\r\nto become its laughing-stock. But Suleiman was spared the sight of such\r\na decadence. Near the end of his reign, after Rustem and Roxelana had\r\nceased to disturb, the system brought to the top one of the greatest of\r\nOttoman statesmen, Mohammed Sokolli. At about the same time the Moslem\r\nInstitution also raised up a great legist, Ebu su’ud.[425] These two\r\nupheld the institutions and the empire at the height of their glory for\r\nnearly thirty years, of which fifteen lay after the death of Suleiman.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. CHARACTER OF THE SULTAN’S COURT\r\n\r\nIn the early stages of all monarchies the household of the prince and\r\nthe government of the state have probably been identical.[426] After\r\nthe period of establishment has come to an end and settled institutions\r\nhave been organized, the household and the government have tended to\r\ndraw apart into separate and distinct systems under different officials.\r\nWhich of the two has become of the greater importance in the eyes of\r\nthe sovereign and in influence upon the policy and destiny of the nation\r\nhas depended on circumstances, and particularly on the character of\r\nindividual monarchs. While such a state has been in a period of increase\r\nof power and influence, the government has regularly been the more\r\nprominent: men of practical experience in affairs and in the field have\r\novershadowed the palace servants. When decay and decline have set in, the\r\nhousehold, partly by way of cause and partly by way of effect, has risen\r\nto supremacy: individuals of more or less secluded life, but possessing\r\nopportunities for personal intercourse with the monarch,—favorites,\r\nbody-servants, women, and eunuchs,—have made the men of affairs and of\r\nwar dependent upon them for place and authority. The Ottoman Empire\r\ncame clearly into the stage of differentiation between household and\r\ngovernment after the conquest of Constantinople in the reign of Mohammed\r\nII. In the time of Suleiman the empire was still in the period when\r\ngovernment was greater than household; but clear signs were appearing\r\nthat a less active and more plastic sovereign would turn the scale.\r\n\r\nThe household of the Ottoman sultan was curiously divided and limited.\r\nAn essential difference between the courts of Christian and Moslem\r\nmonarchs was created by the seclusion of women in Mohammedan society. In\r\nthe West, women appeared with the men of the court not only on occasions\r\nof amusement and diversion, but also in public parades and ceremonies\r\nof less and greater importance, and the ladies of the royal family led\r\nthe fashionable society of the land. In the East, on the other hand,\r\nthe visible court and retinue of the monarch was wholly ungraced by the\r\npresence of the fair sex; all the great ceremonies and cavalcades were\r\nparticipated in by men alone. It seems to be a fact that, before the\r\nmiddle of the reign of Suleiman, no woman resided in the entire vast\r\npalace where the sultan spent most of his time.[427] The women of his\r\nfamily were elsewhere, carefully guarded behind walls which with very\r\nfew exceptions no man but himself might pass.[428] The men and the women\r\nwho were associated with the sultan constituted two separate worlds,\r\nbetween which the only bond was himself.\r\n\r\nThe sultan’s household was divided in another way. By the maxims of\r\ndespotic government it is forbidden that the ruler should associate on\r\nterms of intimate friendship with those who are his high officials of\r\nstate. In order to avoid this regulation and yet provide his master\r\nwith intelligent and amusing companionship, the _Nizam-al-mulk_ advised\r\nthe Seljuk sultan Melik Shah to choose as boon companions a band of\r\ncourtiers who would be allowed to have no share whatever in the conduct\r\nof affairs.[429] This resource was hardly open to the Ottoman sultans,\r\nfirst because the dignity and independence of Moslem-born Ottoman Turks\r\ndeprived them of the pliancy which is expected from courtiers, and second\r\nbecause the sultan’s Christian-born slaves, who had been led onward by\r\nambition ever since they had entered his service, and at the end of\r\ntheir education were ready to become men of affairs, were not fitted\r\nto be mere courtiers. The difficulty became greater after Mohammed II,\r\nfilled with the Byzantine notion of imperial sacredness, ordered that\r\nno one should sit with him at table.[430] A sultan was thus practically\r\nforced by a combination of principles and circumstances to spend his\r\nleisure hours with boys, eunuchs, and women.[431] The only mature men\r\nwith whom he could converse freely were a small and select group of\r\nreligious advisers, astrologers, and physicians; all the other men of his\r\nhousehold met him only formally and for the transaction of business. So\r\ngreat limitations on his companionship could not fail to influence his\r\ncharacter, and in the course of a few generations to tend greatly toward\r\nthe predominance of household over government.\r\n\r\nTo confine the consideration of Suleiman’s court to his immediate\r\nhousehold would be to narrow the discussion too much. The chief officers\r\nof government formed a part of his retinue on all ceremonial occasions,\r\nand had not ceased to be counted as his personal followers. In fact,\r\nall the members of the Ruling Institution, except the _Ajem-oghlans_\r\nand young pages, may be regarded as belonging to the sultan’s court in\r\nthat large sense of the term which includes all those individuals who\r\nare attached to the person of the monarch as his daily associates, his\r\ncouncillors, the officers and members of his household, his body-guard\r\nand palace-guard, and his retinue on ceremonial occasions and in camp.\r\nThe splendid court of Suleiman the Magnificent is worthy of separate and\r\nspecial treatment for which there is no room here; in describing it, as\r\nin describing his army, only those aspects which are of a governmental\r\nnature can be considered. The topics that will claim attention are the\r\nsubdivisions of his household and the main features of its organization,\r\nthe importance given to personal and public ceremony, the splendor of the\r\ncourt, and the influence of the court on the destiny of the empire.\r\n\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION OF THE HOUSEHOLD[432]\r\n\r\nThe sultan’s household may be considered in three principal subdivisions,\r\neach of them composed of a number of parts: the outside service of the\r\npalace, the inside service of the palace, and the harem. The outside\r\nservice was composed of men and _Ajem-oghlans_, the inside service of\r\nwhite eunuchs and pages, the harem of black eunuchs and women. The first\r\ntwo subdivisions were, in time of peace, in attendance at the principal\r\npalace which had been built by Mohammed II on the site of the acropolis\r\nof ancient Byzantium. The grounds of this palace were extensive: within\r\nthe first gate was a large open space used on state occasions as a\r\nparade ground; within the second gate were the buildings of the palace\r\nproper, a beautiful garden, and an exercise ground for the pages. The\r\nmembers of the outside service, except the gardeners, did not ordinarily\r\npass beyond the second gate of this palace. The harem was permanently\r\nlocated some distance away in the center of the city, in the first palace\r\noccupied after the conquest, known in the sixteenth century as the Old\r\nPalace.[433] In time of war, practically the entire outside service, and\r\nthe principal officers and personal attendants from the inside service,\r\naccompanied the sultan. None of the women of the harem were taken with\r\nthe army, as this was against the Ottoman custom, though permitted by the\r\nSacred Law.[434] In excursions during time of peace some of the ladies\r\nmight accompany their lord.[435] The three subdivisions of the household\r\nwill be considered in the reverse order.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HAREM\r\n\r\nThe harem was so distinct in Suleiman’s time from the rest of his\r\nhousehold, so little seen and known, so much his personal affair, that it\r\nwould seem scarcely to demand attention in a consideration of his court.\r\nThe importance of its officials and personages was small as compared with\r\nlater times, after the harem had been removed to the principal palace and\r\nthe sultans had begun to spend a much larger portion of their time in\r\nits society. Yet the influence of two of its ladies upon Suleiman was so\r\ngreat as to give them a place in history and a relation to the destiny\r\nof the nation. Accordingly, the harem cannot be passed over without\r\nmention. Its organization has already been sketched so far as regards the\r\nrecruiting, conversion, and education of the women;[436] its groupings\r\nand principal personages remain to be described.\r\n\r\nThe guard and order of the palace of the harem was committed to forty or\r\nmore black eunuchs,[437] under an official known as the _Kizlar Aghasi_,\r\nor, literally, the “general of the girls.” This _Agha_ was held in great\r\nhonor, and was made administrator of many religious endowments for the\r\nbenefit of various mosques, and particularly of the _vakfs_ of the Holy\r\nCities of Mecca and Medina. His importance in Suleiman’s time bears no\r\ncomparison with what it became later. Other black eunuchs held official\r\npositions in the service of the principal ladies, and had the oversight\r\nof the education of the young princes.[438]\r\n\r\nThe greatest lady of the harem, while life was spared to her, was the\r\nsultan’s mother, the _Sultana Valideh_. Not only did she receive great\r\nrespect and deference from her son, but she had a general oversight and\r\nauthority over all his women. The next lady in importance was the mother\r\nof the sultan’s first son; and after her came the mothers of other sons.\r\nMothers of daughters enjoyed much less consideration. Each of these\r\nfavored ladies had her own suite of apartments, her business staff under\r\na woman known as her _Kiaya_, which may here be translated as steward or\r\nhousekeeper, and her group of personal and domestic servants. The _Kiaya_\r\nof the queen mother enjoyed great importance. The group of slave girls\r\nwho were the sultan’s personal and domestic servants when he visited\r\nthe harem were also under a _Kiaya_ with assistants. Sons of the sultan\r\nlived with their mothers during their tender years. They were carefully\r\neducated in letters and arms, much as were the pages, but with greater\r\ndeference.[439] At a suitable age they were sent out, with carefully\r\nselected little courts, to the governorship of provinces. Daughters were\r\nmarried at an early age to high officials of the sultan.[440] In later\r\ngenerations infant sons who might be born to them were not allowed to\r\nlive, lest they might become a menace to the throne. This seems not\r\nto have been the case in the time of Suleiman, who avoided danger by\r\nexcluding them carefully from office.[441]\r\n\r\nInformation about Suleiman’s harem and family comes guarded with\r\nexplanations of the difficulty found in obtaining trustworthy reports.\r\nSome facts are known, and probabilities exist as to others. Suleiman’s\r\nmother lived until far along in his reign. The mother of his eldest son,\r\nMustapha, held, according to custom, the next place in his harem. After\r\nthe year 1534 she divided her time between the palace at Magnesia, where\r\nher son was _Sanjak Bey_, and the harem palace in Constantinople.[442]\r\nKhurrem, usually called Roxelana, had supplanted her in favor at some\r\nprevious date, and, being legal wife of the Sultan, held a position\r\nsuperior to hers in some respects. Suleiman seems not to have visited his\r\nharem very often.[443] Mihrmah, his daughter by Roxelana, who became the\r\nwife of Rustem, was very dear to him.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INSIDE SERVICE\r\n\r\nThe five chambers of pages, under the control of white eunuchs, and\r\nthe doorkeepers supplied the inside service of the principal palace.\r\nThe head of this service was the _Kapu Aghasi_, or “general of the\r\ngate,” a white eunuch, who was also charged with the management of many\r\nreligious endowments. He had the right to speak to the sultan when he\r\nwished,[444] and hence was very highly regarded. The _Kapuji-bashi_, or\r\nhead doorkeeper, was also a white eunuch, who had charge constantly of\r\nthe second gate of the principal palace, with a company of twenty or more\r\nwhite eunuchs who were guards under him.[445] The pages have already\r\nreceived attention from the educational point of view. Nearest the person\r\nof the sultan were the pages of the _Khas Oda_, or Inner Chamber, of whom\r\nthere were probably thirty-nine, the sultan himself being reckoned the\r\nfortieth.[446] A number of these pages later bore the title of _Agha_,\r\nbut they seem not to have done so in Suleiman’s time. Their chief officer\r\nwas the _Khas Oda-bashi_, or head of the Inner Chamber, one of the\r\npages in Suleiman’s day, but in later times a white eunuch. The pages\r\nof highest rank were the _Silihdar_, who outside the palace carried the\r\nsultan’s weapons, the _Chokadar_, who carried his garments, and the\r\n_Sharabdar_, or cup-bearer.[447] The others took care of his apartments\r\nand his wardrobe, and brought his food to him. The second group of pages\r\nconstituted the _Khazineh Odassi_, or treasury, under a well-paid white\r\neunuch, the inside _Khazinehdar-bashi_. These, to the number of sixty or\r\nseventy, cared for all the treasures in the sultan’s palace, made all\r\npayments, and kept all accounts.[448] Another _Khazinehdar-bashi_ took\r\ncare of all the financial affairs of the inside service which needed\r\nattention outside the palace walls. The _Kiler Odassi_, or pantry, under\r\na white eunuch called the _Kilerji-bashi_, cared for the bread, pastry,\r\nand game of the sultan; their chief controlled also the kitchen service\r\nof the palace. The pages of this chamber seem not yet to have finished\r\ntheir education.[449] They, together with the pages of the Inner Chamber,\r\nrode with the sultan whenever he left the palace. The remaining two\r\nchambers, the Large and the Small, or the Old and the New, were concerned\r\nwholly with the education of the pages.[450] They were under the general\r\ndirection of the _Ikinji-Kapu-oghlan_, or eunuch of the second gate.[451]\r\nThe entire personnel of the inside service amounted to from six to eight\r\nhundred persons. The eunuch officers maintained severe discipline, exact\r\nobedience, and perfect order among them all.[452] The groups of eunuchs\r\nwho had charge of the colleges of pages in Pera and Adrianople may also\r\nbe reckoned in the inside service. It would seem that the accounts of all\r\nthese palaces were kept as one, and that therefore the chief officers of\r\nthe principal palace must have supervised the officers of the others.[453]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OUTSIDE SERVICE\r\n\r\nThe members of the household who were not held within the inner regions\r\nof the palace or near the person of the sultan were far more numerous.\r\nMany stood in close relations to the members of the inner service, either\r\nbeing under their authority or having regular dealings with them. All,\r\nof course, served the sultan, either directly or nearly so, through\r\nthe mediation of one or more officers. To describe at length their\r\nsubdivisions, duties, and officers would be to repeat an account which\r\nhas been given often by others. Only a general sketch will be attempted\r\nhere, by way of distinguishing the various groups of the service.\r\nBeginning with those in closest relations to the sultan, they were the\r\nlearned associates of the master, the kitchen service, the body-guard,\r\nthe palace-guards, the gardeners, the stable service, the tent-pitchers,\r\nthe masters of the hunt, and the intendants.\r\n\r\nThe learned associates of the sultan belonged chiefly to the corps of\r\nthe _Ulema_. They therefore represented the Moslem Institution near the\r\nperson of the monarch. Chief among them was the sultan’s _Hoja_, or\r\nteacher, a confessor or adviser in religious matters, who was held in\r\nvery great esteem and was often advanced to high judicial office. Next\r\ncame two _Imâms_, or preachers to the sultan, associated with whom were a\r\nnumber of muezzins, or chanters. After these ranked the _Hekim-bashi_, or\r\nchief physician, who had ten or more associates; the _Munejim-bashi_, or\r\nchief astrologer, whose services were believed to have a very real value;\r\nand the _Jerrah-bashi_, or chief surgeon, with ten or more helpers.\r\n\r\nThe kitchen service under the oversight of the _Kilerji-bashi_ comprised\r\nbakers, scullions, cooks, confectioners, tasters, and musicians, each to\r\nthe number of from fifty to one hundred.[454] Allied to these were the\r\ncompanies of tailors, shoemakers, furriers, goldsmiths, and the like, who\r\nwere employed exclusively in the palace service.[455] Each group had its\r\nresponsible head and was subject to a thorough oversight, since even such\r\nremote affairs, when under the care of the Ottoman Ruling Institution,\r\nwere regulated and ordered with great precision. A number of these\r\nservants, such as the scullions, wood-cutters, and water-carriers, were\r\n_Ajem-oghlans_.\r\n\r\nThe body-guards were three, the _Muteferrika_, the _Solaks_, and the\r\n_Peiks_. The _Muteferrika_, or Noble Guard, consisted of from one to two\r\nhundred of the choicest graduates from the page schools and of sons of\r\nhigh officials.[456] Among them, in 1575, were brothers of the _Voivodes_\r\nof Wallachia and Moldavia. The _Muteferrika_ followed immediately after\r\nthe sultan on horseback, and in time of battle were ready to defend him\r\nto the end. The _Solaks_ were veteran Janissary archers, to the number\r\nof about one hundred and fifty, who marched on foot beside the sultan\r\nwherever he went, with bows and arrows ready for instant use. The _Peiks_\r\nwere a picturesque company of halberdiers of about one hundred men,[457]\r\nwhich had been taken over, arms, costumes, and all, from the Byzantine\r\nemperors. They ran in front of the sultan when he rode, and were always\r\nready to be sent on missions.\r\n\r\nThe palace-guards were the _Kapujis_, the _Chaushes_, and the\r\n_Bostanjis_. The _Kapujis_, or gatekeepers, were _Ajem-oghlans_ who, to\r\nthe number of three or four hundred,[458] watched the outside gates of\r\nthe principal palace and of the palace of the harem. Like all the other\r\nguards, they accompanied the sultan to war, where they were the guards\r\nof his tent. The _Chaushes_, who numbered about one hundred,[459] were\r\nushers who acted as marshals on the days of Divan and of state ceremony,\r\nand who in time of war dressed the ranks of the troops.[460] They also\r\nacted as messengers of state within the empire. When a distant officer\r\nhad been condemned to death, a _Chaush_ was sent to execute the sentence\r\nand bring back the offender’s head.[461] Since among the _Chaushes_\r\nthere were many renegades who knew various European languages, they were\r\nuseful as interpreters and were sometimes sent as envoys on important\r\nmissions.[462] The _Bostanjis_, or gardeners, were _Ajem-oghlans_,\r\nand as such have been mentioned already. To the number of about four\r\nhundred,[463] they cared for the garden and grounds of the principal\r\npalace, and rowed the sultan’s caiques when he wished to enjoy the\r\nmatchless scenery of the Bosphorus. Their chief, the _Bostanji-bashi_,\r\nwho had risen from their ranks, seems to have been the only adult\r\nman besides the sultan who resided within the inner regions of the\r\npalace.[464] His general charge over all the sultan’s gardens, wherever\r\nthey might be, included oversight of the banks and shores of the\r\nBosphorus, the Sea of Marmora, and the Dardanelles.[465] This gave him\r\ngreat power, and his favor was much courted.\r\n\r\nThe stable service was exceedingly important in a nation which relied\r\nso much upon cavalry, and which was still under the influence of the\r\ntradition of the steppe lands. The sultan for his own use kept a\r\nstable of two hundred horses tended by a hundred men, and for the use\r\nof his retinue four thousand horses tended by two thousand men.[466]\r\nBesides these, a thousand or more Bulgarian Christians known as Voinaks\r\ntended herds of horses on the great domanial pastures.[467] All these\r\nfollowed the army to war as grooms. They were under the control of a\r\nvery great official, the _Emir-al-Akhor_,[468] or grand equerry, who,\r\nwith the second equerry, also had oversight of the numerous saddlers,\r\ncamel-drivers, and muleteers of the imperial service, and control of all\r\nthe domanial pastures and forests of the empire.[469]\r\n\r\nThe head gardener, the head gatekeeper, the grand equerry, the second\r\nequerry, and the _Mir-Alem_[470] or standard-bearer, constituted the\r\nspecial group of officers known as the _Rekiab-Aghalari_, or “generals\r\nof the [imperial] stirrup.” The _Mir-Alem_ had charge of the imperial\r\nstandards and the six horsetails which were borne before the sultan.\r\nHe distributed standards and horsetails to _Beylerbeys_ and _Sanjak\r\nBeys_, who thus in a way received investiture at his hands.[471] As\r\na consequence he ranked first among the officers of the household\r\nas related to the government. He also had superior control over the\r\ngatekeepers, and he commanded the military music.\r\n\r\nThe tent-pitchers, under a _Mihter-bashi_, cared for the sultan’s tents\r\nin peace and war. Similar groups were the _Veznedars_ (who weighed the\r\nmoney received by the sultan), the guards of the outside treasury, the\r\npurchasing agents of cloth and muslins for the palace, and the guardians\r\nof presents.[472]\r\n\r\nThe masters of the hunt were important officials in the time of Suleiman,\r\nwho practised the ancient royal custom of going with great state and\r\nnumerous attendants to hunt over a large region.[473] Heads of the\r\ndog-keepers, falconers, vulturers, gerfalconers, and hawkers held\r\nhonorable position. A number of the pages of the higher _odalar_ had\r\nsubsidiary duties as falconers;[474] Ibrahim was chief falconer at the\r\ntime of his promotion to the position of grand vizier. A part of the\r\nregular army aided in the hunts. The Janissaries show by the names of\r\nsome of their chief officers that their corps grew in part out of the\r\nhunting organization of the early sultans.[475]\r\n\r\nThe intendants, or _Umena_, had charge of various departments of supply\r\nand administration. They were the _Shehr-emini_, or intendant of\r\nimperial buildings; the _Zarabkhaneh-emini_, or intendant of mints and\r\nmines; the _Mutbakh-emini_, or intendant of the kitchen and pantry; the\r\n_Arpa-emini_, or intendant of forage for the stables of the palace; and\r\nthe _Masraf-shehriyari_, or substitute for the intendant of the kitchens.\r\n\r\nThis rapid survey, though by no means complete, shows something of\r\nthe complicated organization, the numerous personnel, and the various\r\nfunctions of the groups of the imperial household. The number of\r\nindividuals connected with it may be estimated to have been between ten\r\nand fifteen thousand, many of whom were not the sultan’s slaves, but his\r\nservants and employees in various capacities. All, however, except the\r\nfew members of the _Ulema_, were under the complete control and command\r\nof members of the Ruling Institution. No confusion resulted from such\r\ngreat complexity, for each group of servants had its definite duties,\r\nand knew exactly from whom to receive orders and to whom to report\r\naccomplishment.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the functions of many of the officials of the household,\r\nespecially those of the head gardener, the grand equerry, and the\r\nstandard-bearer, intrenched upon the province of government. The chief\r\nblack eunuch and the chief white eunuch collected and administered the\r\nrevenues of many parcels of land which were devoted to special purposes.\r\nThe _Umena_ were so clearly recognized as exercising governmental\r\nfunctions that they were regarded as chancellors,—an exception, made\r\nfor the sake of convenience, to the rule of separating household and\r\ngovernmental officials. It resulted, therefore, that, while order was\r\nmaintained with comparative ease within the mechanism of the household\r\nand, as will be seen, of the government, difficulty and confusion\r\naccumulated in the relations of the Ruling Institution to the rest of\r\nthe empire. The splendid organization worked admirably down a certain\r\ndistance from the top; but, as the energy of the single will became\r\nmediated by many officials, and as the multiplex land-ownership and\r\nvaried population of the empire was approached, disorder to the extent\r\nof unworkability was so constantly threatened that only more or less\r\nconvulsive readjustments, resorted to from time to time, enabled the\r\ninstitutions of the empire to remain in being.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CEREMONIES OF THE COURT\r\n\r\nThe Sacred Law, based on the practice of Mohammed and the four early\r\ncaliphs, discouraged display of every sort;[476] nor did the Seljuk\r\nTurks take readily to the magnificence which under Persian influence had\r\nprevailed at the court of the Bagdad caliphate.[477] So, too, the early\r\nOttoman sovereigns appear to have maintained simplicity of life down to\r\nthe time of Murad II. A contemporary observer said: “The very Magnates\r\nand Princes observe such simplicity in all things, that they cannot be\r\ndistinguished from others. I saw the King going a long distance from his\r\npalace to Church accompanied by two youths.... I saw him also praying in\r\nChurch, not in a chair (_cathedra_) or royal throne, but seated like the\r\nrest on a rug spread on the ground; nor was there about him any ornament,\r\neither suspended or exhibited or displayed. He used no singularity in\r\nregard to his garments or his horse, by which he could be distinguished\r\nfrom others. I saw him at the funeral of his mother, and I could not\r\npossibly have recognized him, had he not been pointed out to me.”[478]\r\n\r\nIn the understanding of Mohammed II, however, the capture of the\r\nimperial city seems to have included the appropriation of imperial\r\nforms and ceremonies; for no small number of his _Kanuns_ dealt with\r\nmatters of rank and ceremony.[479] By the time of Suleiman the _Kanuni\r\nTeshrifat_, or Law of Ceremonies, had become a collection of considerable\r\nmagnitude.[480] It is significant that the regulations concerning such\r\nmatters as the color and shape and material of robes and turbans,\r\nthe order of precedence on small as well as great occasions, and the\r\nobservances proper to each such occasion were made a matter of law. On\r\nthe one hand, a body of practice was set up which, though not distinctly\r\nforbidden by the Sacred Law, was contrary to its essential spirit. On\r\nthe other hand, to rules of court etiquette, which in the West are\r\noften unwritten and certainly have not similar standing with acts of\r\nlegislation, were given the rank and authority of imperial laws. The Law\r\nof Ceremonies stood on a par with the Law of Subjects, the Law of Fiefs,\r\nthe Law of Egypt, and the Law of Fines and Punishments. In fact, this law\r\nwas observed even more carefully than the others, since the matters which\r\nit covered usually came under the eye of the sultan himself. It was as\r\nmuch the duty of an officer to wear the proper costume, and to appear in\r\nthe right place and at the right time at public ceremonies, as to attend\r\nto the business connected with his position.\r\n\r\nAll the classes of members of the sultan’s household, all the high\r\nofficers of government, and all the separate bodies of troops in the\r\nstanding army were clearly distinguished from each other by costume or\r\nhead-dress or by both. Each group and every officer in each group had\r\nhis exact place in every ceremonial assembly and his exact rank in every\r\nprocession. Each great official, beginning with the sultan, had his title\r\nfor use in public documents, a designation which, though not exactly\r\nfixed, varied little from time to time.[481]\r\n\r\nCeremonial occasions were numerous and splendid. All were participated\r\nin by representatives from each division of the Ruling Institution, and\r\non the greatest occasions practically its whole membership was present.\r\nThe ceremonies may be grouped as simple occasions, religious festivals,\r\nand extraordinary ceremonies. Among the simpler ceremonial occasions were\r\nthe regular meetings of the Divan, which in time of peace took place four\r\ntimes a week, on Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday. On Fridays the\r\nsultan rode forth to mosque in magnificent state.[482] On other days some\r\nof the officials made visits of state to their superiors. Every three\r\nmonths the Janissaries were paid with much ceremony in the parade-ground\r\nbetween the first and second gates of the palace. For the sake of giving\r\nan impression of wealth and magnificence, such occasions were frequently\r\nchosen for the reception of ambassadors.[483]\r\n\r\nThe great religious festivals of Islam, in which all the Moslems of the\r\nempire participated, were celebrated by the court with great pomp. These\r\nwere the two feasts of Bairam, one of which comes at the close of the\r\nfast of the month of Ramazan, and the other and greater seventy days\r\nlater.[484] On the great day of Bairam the ceremony of kissing the hand\r\nof the sultan was performed by all the officials of the household and\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe principal extraordinary ceremonies were those in celebration of\r\nthe birth of sons or daughters to the sultan, of the circumcision of\r\nprinces and the marriage of princesses, the accession to the throne, and\r\nthe going forth of the sultan to war. The greatest of all Suleiman’s\r\ncelebrations was probably that of the circumcision of his sons, Mustapha,\r\nMohammed, and Selim, in 1530. Twenty-one successive days of display,\r\nfeasting, games, and formal presentation of gifts contributed to the\r\nunparalleled grandeur of the occasion.[485]\r\n\r\nIt is not impossible to obtain an idea of the appearance of the sultan’s\r\ncourt and retinue at this time of the empire’s greatest splendor. One\r\nobserver, often quoted already, who was gifted with superb powers of\r\nexpression, has left a clear record. Seer and seen alike vanished from\r\nthe earth more than three centuries ago; yet through the keen eyes of\r\nOgier Ghiselin de Busbecq the world has ever since looked upon the great\r\nSuleiman as he sat and rode in state. Busbecq, ambassador to the Ottoman\r\ncourt from Emperor Charles the Fifth and his brother Ferdinand, describes\r\nhis first audience with Suleiman in camp at Amasia in 1555, also the\r\ntrain that attended the sultan as he went forth from Constantinople to\r\nwar against his son Bayezid in 1559, and a Bairam ceremony in camp near\r\nScutari a few weeks after the latter event. Some quotations from these\r\ndescriptions will give a better idea of Suleiman’s court than any number\r\nof statistics. The first describes the audience at Amasia:—\r\n\r\n“The Sultan was seated on a very low ottoman, not more than a foot from\r\nthe ground, which was covered with a quantity of costly rugs and cushions\r\nof exquisite workmanship; near him lay his bow and arrows....\r\n\r\n“On entering we were separately conducted into the royal presence by the\r\nchamberlains, who grasped our arms. This has been the Turkish fashion of\r\nadmitting people to the Sovereign ever since a Croat, in order to avenge\r\nthe death of his master, Marcus, Despot of Servia, asked Amurath for an\r\naudience, and took advantage of it to slay him. After having gone through\r\na pretence of kissing his hand, we were conducted backwards to the wall\r\nopposite his seat, care being taken that we should never turn our backs\r\non him....\r\n\r\n“The Sultan’s hall was crowded with people, among whom were several\r\nofficers of high rank. Besides these there were all the troopers of\r\nthe Imperial guard, Spahis, Ghourebas, Ouloufedgis, and a large force\r\nof Janissaries.... Take your stand by my side, and look at the sea of\r\nturbaned heads, each wrapped in twisted folds of the whitest silk; look\r\nat those marvellously handsome dresses of every kind and every colour;\r\ntime would fail me to tell how all around is glittering with gold, with\r\nsilver, with purple, with silk, and with velvet; words cannot convey\r\nan adequate idea of that strange and wondrous sight: it was the most\r\nbeautiful spectacle I ever saw.\r\n\r\n“With all this luxury great simplicity and economy are combined; every\r\nman’s dress, whatever his position may be, is of the same pattern; no\r\nfringes or useless points are sewn on, as is the case with us, appendages\r\nwhich cost a great deal of money, and are worn out in three days. In\r\nTurkey the tailor’s bill for a silk or velvet dress, even though it be\r\nrichly embroidered, as most of them are, is only a ducat. They were quite\r\nas much surprised at our manner of dressing as we were at theirs. They\r\nuse long robes reaching down to the ankles, which have a stately effect\r\nand add to the wearer’s height, while our dress is so short and scanty\r\nthat it leaves exposed to view more than is comely of the human shape;\r\nbesides, somehow or other, our fashion of dress seems to take from the\r\nwearer’s height, and make him look shorter than he really is.\r\n\r\n“I was greatly struck with the silence and order that prevailed in\r\nthis great crowd. There were no cries, no hum of voices, the usual\r\naccompaniments of a motley gathering, neither was there any jostling;\r\nwithout the slightest disturbance each man took his proper place\r\naccording to his rank. The Agas, as they call their chiefs, were seated,\r\nto wit, generals, colonels (bimbaschi), and captains (soubaschi). Men\r\nof a lower position stood. The most interesting sight in this assembly\r\nwas a body of several thousand Janissaries, who were drawn up in a long\r\nline apart from the rest; their array was so steady and motionless that,\r\nbeing at a little distance, it was some time before I could make up my\r\nmind as to whether they were human beings or statues; at last I received\r\na hint to salute them, and saw all their heads bending at the same moment\r\nto return my bow.[486] On leaving the assembly we had a fresh treat in\r\nthe sight of the household cavalry returning to their quarters; the men\r\nwere mounted on splendid horses, excellently groomed, and gorgeously\r\naccoutred. And so we left the royal presence.”[487]\r\n\r\nOn the second occasion, when Suleiman was going forth to war, Busbecq\r\nobtained a place at a window:—\r\n\r\n“From this I had the pleasure of seeing the magnificent column which\r\nwas marching out. The Ghourebas and Ouloufedgis rode in double, and the\r\nSilihdars and Spahis in single file. The cavalry of the Imperial guard\r\nconsists of these regiments, each of which forms a distinct body, and\r\nhas separate quarters. They are believed to amount to about 6000 men,\r\nmore or less. Besides these, I saw a large force, consisting of the\r\nhousehold slaves belonging to the sultan himself, the Pashas, and the\r\nother court dignitaries. The spectacle presented by a Turkish horseman is\r\nindeed magnificent. His high-bred steed generally comes from Cappadocia\r\nor Syria, and its trappings and saddle sparkle with gold and jewels in\r\nsilver settings. The rider himself is resplendent in a dress of cloth of\r\ngold or silver, or else of silk or velvet. The very lowest of them is\r\nclothed in scarlet, violet, or blue robes of the finest cloth. Right and\r\nleft hang two handsome cases, one of which holds his bow, and the other\r\nis full of painted arrows. Both of these cases are curiously wrought,\r\nand come from Babylon,[488] as does also the targe, which is fitted to\r\nthe left arm, and is proof only against arrows or the blows of a mace or\r\nsword. In the right hand, unless he prefers to keep it disengaged, is a\r\nlight spear, which is generally painted green. Round his waist is girt a\r\njewelled scimitar, while a mace of steel hangs from his saddle-bow....\r\nThe covering they wear on the head is made of the whitest and lightest\r\ncotton-cloth, in the middle of which rises a fluted peak of fine purple\r\nsilk. It is a favorite fashion to ornament this head-dress with black\r\nplumes.\r\n\r\n“When the cavalry had ridden past, they were followed by a long\r\nprocession of Janissaries, but few of whom carried any arms except their\r\nregular weapon, the musket. They were dressed in uniforms of almost\r\nthe same shape and colour, so that you might recognize them to be the\r\nslaves, and as it were the household, of the same master. Among them no\r\nextraordinary or startling dress was to be seen, and nothing slashed\r\nor pierced. They say their clothes wear out quite fast enough without\r\ntheir tearing them themselves. There is only one thing in which they\r\nare extravagant, viz., plumes, head-dresses, etc., and the veterans\r\nwho formed the rear guard were specially distinguished by ornaments of\r\nthis kind. The plumes which they insert in their frontlets might well\r\nbe mistaken for a walking forest.[489] Then followed on horseback their\r\ncaptains and colonels, distinguished by the badges of their rank. Last\r\nof all, rode their Aga by himself. Then succeeded the chief dignitaries\r\nof the Court, and among them the Pashas, and then the royal body-guard,\r\nconsisting of infantry, who wore a special uniform and carried bows\r\nready strung, all of them being archers.[490] Next came the Sultan’s\r\ngrooms leading a number of fine horses with handsome trappings for their\r\nmaster’s use. He was mounted himself on a noble steed; his look was\r\nstern, and there was a frown on his brow; it was easy to see that his\r\nanger had been aroused. Behind him came three pages, one of whom carried\r\na flask of water, another a cloak, and the third a box.[491] These were\r\nfollowed by some eunuchs of the bedchamber, and the procession was closed\r\nby a squadron of horse about two hundred strong [the Muteferrika].”[492]\r\n\r\nBusbecq spent three months in Suleiman’s camp near Scutari:—\r\n\r\n“I should have returned to Constantinople on the day before the Bairam,\r\nhad I not been detained by my wish to see that day’s ceremonies. The\r\nTurks were about to celebrate the rites of the festival on an open and\r\nlevel plain before the tents of Solyman; and I could hardly hope that\r\nsuch an occasion of seeing them would ever present itself again. I gave\r\nmy servants orders to promise a soldier some money and so get me a\r\nplace in his tent, on a mound which commanded a good view of Solyman’s\r\npavilions. Thither I repaired at sunrise. I saw assembled on the plain\r\na mighty multitude of turbaned heads, attentively following, in the\r\nmost profound silence, the words of the priest who was leading their\r\ndevotions. They kept their ranks, each in his proper position; the\r\nlines of troops looked like so many hedges or walls parting out the\r\nwide plain, on which they were drawn up. According to its rank in the\r\nservice each corps was posted nearer to, or farther from, the place\r\nwhere the Sultan stood. The troops were dressed in brilliant uniforms,\r\ntheir head-dresses rivalling snow in whiteness. The scene which met my\r\neyes was charming, the different colours having a most pleasing effect.\r\nThe men were so motionless that they seemed rooted to the ground on\r\nwhich they stood. There was no coughing, no clearing the throat, and\r\nno voice to be heard, and no one looked behind him or moved his head.\r\nWhen the priest pronounced the name of Mahommet all alike bowed their\r\nheads to their knees at the same moment, and when he uttered the name of\r\nGod they fell on their faces in worship and kissed the ground.... When\r\nprayers were finished, the serried ranks broke up, and the whole plain\r\nwas gradually covered with their surging masses. Presently the Sultan’s\r\nservants appeared bringing their master’s dinner, when, lo and behold!\r\nthe Janissaries laid their hands on the dishes, seized their contents\r\nand devoured them, amid much merriment. This licence is allowed by\r\nancient custom as part of that day’s festivity, and the Sultan’s wants\r\nare otherwise provided for. I returned to Constantinople full of the\r\nbrilliant spectacle, which I had thoroughly enjoyed.”[493]\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF THE COURT\r\n\r\nThe influence of the Ottoman court may be looked at in three ways,—as\r\naffecting the sultan, the Ruling Institution, and the destiny of the\r\nempire; but all three ultimately reduce to the last. The sultan was\r\ninfluenced by his personal relationships with the different individuals\r\nor groups which came into closest contact with him. Reference has already\r\nbeen made to Roxelana. Undoubtedly she had much influence over her\r\nimperial husband, but to what extent she pushed him toward particular\r\ndecisions and actions cannot be known. It is improbable that she had\r\nanything of consequence to do with the death of Ibrahim, since the\r\nfavorite’s own actions had brought matters to such a pass that he was a\r\nmenace to the throne; moreover, her influence in public affairs seems not\r\nyet to have become great. Some writers of that date do not mention her\r\nat all, though she had already won the supreme affection of Suleiman,\r\nand had, so to speak, passed round the superior position of the mother\r\nof the first-born son by being made a legal wife.[494] Seventeen years\r\nlater the situation was clear: Roxelana had triumphed completely over\r\nthe mother of Mustapha; her son-in-law Rustem, married to Suleiman’s\r\nwell-beloved daughter Mihrmah, had held the supreme office of grand\r\nvizier for nine years; her hump-backed son Jehangir was Suleiman’s\r\nfavorite child. Nevertheless, as late as the beginning of 1553 Suleiman\r\nseems to have intended still that Mustapha should occupy the throne.[495]\r\n\r\nMustapha became a victim less of Roxelana and Rustem than of the\r\nindeterminate and dangerous condition of the rules of succession to the\r\nthrone.[496] Had primogeniture been the established order, Mustapha need\r\nonly have been on his guard against poison; he would have lacked motive\r\nfor rebellion, and his father would not have been in fear of deposition.\r\nHad not Mohammed II established the terrible _Kanun_ which ordered the\r\nexecution of the brothers of a sultan at his accession, Roxelana need not\r\nhave feared for the lives of her own sons. Had not the Janissaries helped\r\nSelim to the throne ahead of time and against the wishes of his father,\r\ntheir favor toward Mustapha would not have forced a crisis. If Suleiman\r\nreally desired Mustapha to succeed him, he made a great mistake in\r\nsending him far away to the governorship of Amasia. Bayezid, the ablest\r\nliving son of Roxelana, was in Karamania; and Selim, the least promising\r\nof Roxelana’s children, but apparently her favorite, was assigned to\r\nthe governorship at Magnesia. Selim was thus removed from the capital\r\nby a journey of only five or six days, Bayezid by a somewhat greater\r\ndistance, and Mustapha by a journey of twenty-six days.[497] Suleiman\r\nmay have meant by these appointments only to promote his sons to more\r\ndistant governorships as they grew in experience and could be entrusted\r\nwith greater responsibilities; they, on the other hand, could hardly fail\r\nto suspect that he had different intentions. Without further discussion,\r\nsuffice it to say that, with custom and law as it was, the situation\r\nwas untenable. First Mustapha, and later Roxelana’s own son Bayezid,\r\nbecame the victims of inexorable circumstances in which she undoubtedly\r\nplayed some part, though exactly what it was cannot be known.[498] In\r\nso far as she contributed to the fatal outcome, she hastened the fall\r\nof the empire. If ever a government demanded a strong man to keep it\r\nin operation, the Ottoman government needed one to maintain its Ruling\r\nInstitution. From the beginning there had been as yet no failure; but\r\nafter Suleiman the Magnificent, the Legislator, was to come Selim the\r\nSot, the Debauché!\r\n\r\nNor was the beloved and pious Mihrmah without her influence on the fate\r\nof the empire, if it be true that she urged her father on to the great\r\nexpedition against Malta.[499] His reign had opened with two great\r\ntriumphs: the fortresses that had defied the great Conqueror, Belgrade\r\nand Rhodes, had fallen before his troops. He had failed before Vienna,\r\nit is true; but in the thirty-five succeeding years he had made large\r\nconquests, he had strengthened his power, and his prestige had grown\r\nsteadily. Now, near the close of his life, his mailed fist was broken\r\nupon a rocky isle in the Mediterranean. What but the confidence gained\r\nby that successful resistance gathered and nerved the Christian fleet\r\nthat won the day at Lepanto? The influence of Roxelana and Mihrmah\r\nforeshadowed the power exerted in later reigns by far inferior and far\r\nworse women.\r\n\r\nThe influence of Ibrahim, for whose promotion Suleiman violated the\r\nrules of advancement in the government service, and of Rustem, for whom\r\nhe broke the rule of giving no high place to relatives of the imperial\r\nfamily, has been discussed already.[500] In his late years the Sultan\r\ncame greatly under the influence of the _Ulema_, who had readier access\r\nto him than had any other outside force,[501] and whose power over him\r\nhas been thought by some to have been unfavorable. Just what ills it\r\nbrought about in his own time, however, are not easily to be discovered.\r\n\r\nThe Ruling Institution was affected strongly by the splendor and luxury\r\nof the court of Suleiman. The Sultan had so enormous an establishment,\r\nand was so fond of display and ceremony, that a similar spirit developed\r\nin all his _kullar_. Each officer of position became inordinately\r\nambitious to have a large household, many horses, much portable wealth,\r\nand superb equipment for his horses and servants on state occasions and\r\nin time of war. Just as Suleiman’s splendor embarrassed his finances, so\r\nthat he was willing that Rustem should require payment for office from\r\nnewly-appointed great officials, so most of his _kullar_, in order to\r\nkeep up display, were led to undignified and extortionate procedures.\r\nIn the time of Suleiman’s grandfather the Ottomans of high position\r\nhad already been excessively grasping. “And to tell the truth,” writes\r\nSpandugino, “in that country they are more eager after money than devils\r\nafter souls. And one cannot accomplish anything with the princes or\r\nlords except by the power of money. In general, as well the emperor as\r\nhis princes and lords have mouths only for eating, for if you go to them\r\nwithout giving them some present you will accomplish nothing.”[502]\r\n\r\nThat eagerness for wealth with which Spandugino reproached the Turks\r\nbecame only worse under the Magnificent sultan’s example. The members of\r\nthe Ruling Institution might prey on each other to a certain extent by\r\nthe sale of offices; but the ultimate evil effect fell upon the subjects\r\noutside. They in the end must pay for all the luxury and splendor of\r\nthe great court and the little courts. The pressure upon them tended to\r\nbecome worse and worse. Lands began to grow less productive and to pass\r\nout of cultivation. That dead blight began to descend upon agriculture\r\nand trade which persists in Turkey to the present day.[503] Yet in the\r\ntime of Suleiman this weakness hardly appeared. Although his best two\r\nsons had come to cruel deaths, although twenty thousand of his troops\r\nhad lately died in vain at Malta, he went forth to his last campaign\r\nwith a train which surpassed in pomp and splendor all that he had led\r\nbefore.[504]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE RULING INSTITUTION: AS GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe Ottoman Ruling Institution has now been considered in all but the\r\nlast of its aspects. The recruiting of its members from Christian\r\nsubjects and enemies, their conversion to Mohammedanism, and their\r\ntraining for the duties of war and government were first explained; then\r\nthe military duties and organization of the sultan’s _kullar_, their\r\nprivileged and noble status, and their organization and activity as a\r\nhousehold and court were described. Of the seven aspects in which the\r\nRuling Institution may be considered only one remains, that of government\r\nin the narrow sense.\r\n\r\nWith certain exceptions, the Ruling Institution constituted the\r\ngovernment of the Ottoman Empire. According to the Sacred Law, the\r\nrendering of justice belonged to the Moslem Institution, and many\r\ninternal matters were left to be regulated by the subject nationalities,\r\nwhich were organized as churches, and by the foreign colonies, which\r\nremained under their own laws; but even over these bodies the Ruling\r\nInstitution held the sword, and in the case of the Moslem Institution\r\nit held the purse-strings also. Aside from such exceptions, it attended\r\nto all the functions of government that were performed within the\r\nempire. These, however, as will appear, were by no means so numerous and\r\nextensive as are the activities of a progressive twentieth-century state.\r\n\r\nSome of the functions of government cared for by the Ruling Institution\r\nhave already been described in the previous chapters. The guidance of\r\nthe educational system, the management of the army of the empire, the\r\nconduct of local government, the oversight of the household, the care of\r\nthe sultan’s gardens, pastures, and forests, the regulation of ceremonies\r\nat his court, may be all be regarded as tasks of government. To some of\r\nthem it will be necessary to refer again briefly; but the fact that they\r\nhave been described already simplifies the problem of setting forth the\r\nplan of the government in its narrower sense.\r\n\r\n\r\nFUNCTIONS OF THE OTTOMAN GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nAll governments must in some fashion maintain themselves in place and\r\nin operation; they must obtain means to meet expenses, and they must\r\nkeep some kind of record of their receipts and expenditures and of their\r\nacts. They must alter and expand the unwritten and the written rules\r\nunder which they operate, at least enough to keep their system workable.\r\nThey must protect their subjects sufficiently to enable them to earn a\r\nliving and the means to meet taxation. They must meet the efforts of\r\nother governments of both a diplomatic and a military character. All\r\nthese things the Ottoman government did in its own way. In addition, it\r\nremained in the sixteenth century strongly under the ancient impulse to\r\nincrease its bounds and the number of its subjects, particularly at the\r\nexpense of Christians and Shiites and in the interest of Sunnite Islam.\r\n\r\nThe Ottoman government did not include among its functions the building\r\nand maintenance of systems of roads, bridges, and ferries, the conduct\r\nof a public postal service, the promotion of agriculture, industry, and\r\ncommerce, the organization of a system of public and universal education,\r\nthe adjustment of taxation and customs duties in the interest of the\r\nwelfare of its subjects, or an extension of the activities and liberties\r\nof its subjects. Benevolence toward the common people had hardly emerged\r\ninto the consciousness of any sixteenth-century state. Self-maintenance\r\nin power by the most available means, which were usually military\r\nforce; increase of power, authority, and territory, by similar means;\r\nand, incidentally, an assurance of the well-being of all the privileged\r\npersons who were connected with the government, in proportion to their\r\nimportance: these were the chief objects aimed at by the governments of\r\nthat day, whether in the West or in the East.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the chief energies of the Ottoman Ruling Institution in its\r\ncapacity as government were directed toward the smooth running of the\r\nmachine. For this object the best and most devoted men were obtained and\r\ntrained. They, with as many other members of the Ottoman nationality\r\nas possible, were organized into a magnificent army, which first of\r\nall defended and maintained the government against enemies at home and\r\nabroad, and then increased its dominions and greatness by victorious\r\ncampaigns in the “land of war.” The religious motive entered strongly\r\nhere, since the power and conquests of the Ottoman nation were felt to\r\nbe the power and conquests of Islam. The welfare and contentment of the\r\nmembers of the government, beginning with the sovereign, were assured by\r\nexclusive privileges, elaborate organization of personal service, and\r\nceremonies in which they could be flattered by opportunities for display\r\nand by gradations of honor.\r\n\r\nThere remained as the special functions of government, first, the careful\r\nelaboration and watchful improvement of the regulations under which the\r\nRuling Institution and the state were organized; second, the keeping of\r\nevery part of the administrative machinery in the best possible order\r\nand condition; third, the acquisition of enough money and means to carry\r\nout the purposes of the government, and the supplying of this money\r\nand means in suitable quantity at the time and place needed and to the\r\nproper persons; and, fourth, the preparing and recording of all written\r\nacts necessary to the transaction of the business of the government. A\r\nfifth function was the adjustment of disputes between subjects of the\r\nempire who were not connected with the government; this was attended to\r\nlargely by another institution, though supported and executed by the\r\nmembers of the government itself. The first of these functions, that of\r\nlegislation, was cared for chiefly by the sultan himself; the second, of\r\nadministration, was controlled by his viziers; the third, of finance,\r\nwas managed by the _Defterdars_ through twenty-five departments; the\r\nfourth, of chancery, was under the power of the _Nishanjis_; the fifth,\r\nof justice between the subjects, was, in matters controlled by the\r\nSacred Law, administered by the _Ulema_, the learned men of the Moslem\r\nInstitution, under the headship of the _Kaziaskers_. These five functions\r\nwere by no means so clearly separated as were the groups of officials\r\nconcerned with them. A logical classification of duties would have\r\nnecessitated much readjustment.\r\n\r\nThe striking way in which the Ottoman Ruling Institution, when regarded\r\nas a government, limited its operations almost exclusively to its\r\nown affairs seems to have resulted from its character as a single\r\nslave-family. Although its essential character is somewhat obscured by\r\nthe facts that it was by far the largest slave-family in the empire, that\r\nit had ruling authority, and that some of its members exercised general\r\ngovernmental functions, it is nevertheless true that the legislation\r\nof the sultans and of Suleiman himself was largely directed to the\r\nregulation of the institution itself, most laws of wider and deeper\r\nimport being included in the almost unchangeable Sacred Law. The business\r\nof the viziers was also largely that of the institution, aside from the\r\nfact that the grand vizier, as representative of the sultan, headed also\r\nthe justice of the empire. The imperial treasury, again, was concerned,\r\nin the first place, with obtaining the revenues due to the sultan, such\r\nof them as did not come from his personal rights as the owner of domain\r\nlands being farmed out, so that the government did not even here touch\r\nthe people directly. In the second place, the revenues were paid out to\r\nthe members of the institution as soldiers, servants, officials, and\r\nmembers of the royal family. All who followed the sultan to war without\r\nbelonging to his great household provided their own support. Even the\r\nofficers of local government, though appointed from his _kullar_, were\r\nsupported by the assignment of lands which they administered themselves\r\nby means of the Ruling Institution. The sultan’s chancery was similarly\r\nconfined in its operations to the preparation and registration of acts,\r\ndecrees, commissions, and the like, most of which were concerned with the\r\nadjustment and operation of the Ruling Institution. Finally, the officers\r\nof the army and the government rendered and administered justice to all\r\nthe _kullar_, besides deciding many law cases under imperial laws. To\r\na very great extent, then, the sultan’s government was that of a large\r\nslave-family, which secured its own interests and managed to the best\r\nadvantage its own affairs, which cared little for the welfare of the\r\ngreat majority of the people of the empire, and which had dealings with\r\nthem and attended to their affairs only when obliged to do so by the\r\npursuit of its own aims.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SULTAN AS HEAD OF THE STATE AND OF THE GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nSuleiman’s authority rested actually and immediately upon the military\r\nmight which he controlled. Psychologically, it was strongly supported\r\nby the ancient Turkish tradition of absolute obedience to the ruler who\r\nled and fed his people, and by the undying allegiance of the population\r\nof wide areas to the Caesar of New Rome, to whose seat and splendor\r\nSuleiman had succeeded. Theoretically, and, if a modern expression may be\r\nused, constitutionally, Suleiman’s power was that of the ancient caliphs\r\nof Islam. It is true that he suffered under one apparently complete\r\ndisqualification. A tradition of high order asserted that the _Imâms_\r\nmust be of the Prophet’s tribe, the Koreish;[505] but by an extension of\r\nthe principle of agreement (_ijma_) by which the consensus of the Islamic\r\ndoctors of the law of any period may establish an interpretation of some\r\npassage of the Sacred Law, Suleiman’s father, after the acquisition of\r\nthe Holy Cities and the resignation of the last Abbassid caliph at Cairo,\r\nhad come into full rights as caliph. The title itself seems to have been\r\nknown by none of the Western writers of the sixteenth century, nor was it\r\ncommonly used by Suleiman in public documents.\r\n\r\nIn his capacity as caliph, Suleiman was head of the Islamic state,\r\ndefender, executor, and interpreter of the Sacred Law, and defender of\r\nthe faith. He was under obligation to punish heretics and unsubmissive\r\ninfidels, to protect true believers, and to extend the area of his\r\ndivinely-appointed rule. To him, after Allah and the Prophet, was due the\r\nabsolute obedience of all good Moslems within his dominions. As for his\r\nChristian subjects, they also regarded him as their lawful sovereign,\r\ngiven by God as a punishment for their sins. The Sacred Law recognized no\r\npower of legislation in the head of the state, since God through Mohammed\r\nhad legislated once for all; but it entrusted to him the functions of\r\nadministration and justice, to be exercised to the fullest possible\r\nextent, subject always to the prescriptions of the Law. The sultan being\r\nthus supreme, all the great institutions of the Ottoman Empire are to be\r\nthought of, not as built upward from a basis in the popular will, but\r\nas extended downward from the divinely-appointed sovereign at the top.\r\nTo what extent the Ruling Institution held this relationship has been\r\nindicated already. Central and local government, household and court,\r\nstanding, feudal, and irregular army, all depended upon the sultan. The\r\nMoslem Institution recognized him as its head, and the highest officials\r\nof the judiciary, chosen out of its membership, were appointed by him\r\nand removable at his will.[506] So also the _Mufti_, the chief of the\r\njurists, was appointed by the sultan.[507] Even the ecclesiastical\r\norganizations of the subject Christians and Jews were likewise extended\r\ndownward from his authority, since at the capture of Constantinople the\r\nConqueror had at once assumed that temporal headship of the Christian\r\nchurches which had been held by the Byzantine emperors.[508] The Greek\r\nPatriarch received from the sultan appointment and investiture, including\r\na command to bishops, clergy, and people of his faith to render obedience\r\nto him in matters within his province; the other Christian groups and\r\nthe Jews were likewise dependent. Finally, the privileges enjoyed by\r\nthe foreign settlements all depended upon grants from the sultan or\r\nupon treaties made with him in his sovereign capacity.[509] As for the\r\nofficials of the Ruling Institution, they were all either directly or\r\nindirectly the sultan’s appointees. Grand vizier, viziers, treasurers,\r\nchancellor, generals of the inside service, generals of the outside\r\nservice and the army, _Beylerbeys_ and _Sanjak Beys_, all took their\r\nplaces at a word from him, and at a second word all left them without\r\na murmur.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SULTAN AS LEGISLATOR\r\n\r\nSo far as legislation was possible under the Ottoman system, the sole\r\npower to issue it rested in the sultan. The law which demanded obedience\r\nwithin the Ottoman Empire was fourfold: the _Sheri_, or Sacred Law of\r\nIslam; the _Kanuns_, or written decrees of the sultans; the _Adet_, or\r\nestablished custom; and the _Urf_, or sovereign will of the reigning\r\nsultan.[510] The _Sheri_ was above the sultan and unchangeable by him;\r\nthe _Kanuns_ and the _Adet_ were subordinate to the _Urf_; the _Urf_,\r\nwhen expressed and written, became _Kanun_ and annulled all contradictory\r\n_Kanuns_ and _Adet_.\r\n\r\nThe _Sheri_ was the whole body of Islamic law as accepted by the Ottoman\r\nnation. Its long history cannot be detailed here. Based originally on\r\nthe Koran, supplemented by traditions of Mohammed’s legal decisions\r\nand sayings, and by the decisions of the early caliphs and the\r\ninterpretations of early judges,[511] it was first formulated by Abu\r\nHanifa, who was the earliest of the four great orthodox Moslem doctors,\r\nand who became the accepted teacher of all Turkish peoples.[512] His\r\ncode was worked over again and again in the course of six centuries,\r\nas new decisions of judges and interpretations of jurists accumulated.\r\nMohammed II found it necessary to have a new code prepared, a task for\r\nwhich he chose Khosrew Pasha, who, singularly enough, was a Christian\r\nrenegade, seemingly almost the only one who rose high in the Moslem\r\nInstitution.[513] This work, finished in 1470,[514] was not sufficient in\r\nthe days of Suleiman. At the time of its preparation the Ottoman Empire\r\nhad been still wholly within territory that had remained Christian during\r\nall the early brilliant period of Islam; but since then the sultans had\r\nconquered three seats of the later caliphate, Damascus, Bagdad, and\r\nCairo, and had come to hold the protectorate of the Holy Cities, where\r\nMohammed and the early caliphs had ruled. A new code of law, therefore,\r\nbetter adapted to the more widely Moslem character which the empire\r\nhad assumed, was demanded. Suleiman charged Sheik Ibrahim Halebi (of\r\nAleppo) with the task of preparing such a code; and the result, prepared\r\nbefore 1549, was the _Multeka ol-ebhar_, the “Confluence of the Seas,”\r\nwhich remained the foundation of Ottoman law until the reforms of the\r\nnineteenth century.[515] The _Multeka_ did not, however, entirely replace\r\nthe previous codes and collections of _fetvas_, or authoritative juristic\r\nopinions, which continued to be used as law books of less weight.\r\n\r\nEarly in the process of formulation, the Sacred Law was separated\r\nlogically into two great divisions,—matters of faith and morals, and\r\npractical regulations, groups corresponding more or less closely to\r\nthe Western conceptions of theology and law. The Moslems never made an\r\nactual separation of these two divisions of the Sacred Law; both in\r\neducation and in practice they regarded them as parts of one great unity\r\nof advice, precept, and command, divinely sanctioned and binding upon all\r\ntrue believers. The practical regulations, or the Law proper, went by\r\nthe Arabic name of _fikh_; it included both jurisprudence and positive\r\nlaw.[516]\r\n\r\nA group of Dutch and German thinkers, led by Dr. Snouck Hurgronje,\r\nhas been so strongly impressed by the jurisprudential side of the\r\n_Sheri_ as almost to deny that it has or has ever had an important\r\npractical side;[517] but a careful consideration of the early history\r\nof the Ottoman Empire suggests that their view in its entirety is not\r\nsupported by the facts. Dr. Goldziher says: “In later days, historical\r\nconsideration has proved that only a small part of this system,\r\nconnected with religious and family life, has a practical effect as of\r\nold, while in many parts of merely juristical character this theological\r\nlaw is entirely put aside in actual jurisdiction.... Snouck Hurgronje was\r\nreally the first who set forth with great acuteness and sure judgment the\r\nhistorical truth, namely, that what we call Muhammedan law is nothing but\r\nan _ideal_ law, a theoretical system; in a word, a learned _school-law_,\r\nwhich reflects the thoughts of pious theologians about the arrangement\r\nof Islamic society, whose sphere of influence was willingly extended by\r\npious rulers—as far as possible—but which as a whole could hardly ever\r\nhave been the real practical standard of public life. He finds there\r\nrather _a doctrine of duties_ (_Pflichtenlehre_) of quite an ideal and\r\ntheological character, traced out by generations of religious scholars,\r\nwho wished to rule life by the scale of an age which in their idea\r\nwas the golden period, and whose traditions they wished to maintain,\r\npropagate, and develop. Even the penalties for offenses against religious\r\nlaws are often nothing else but ideal claims of the pious, dead letters\r\nconceived in studies and fostered in the hearts of God-fearing scholars,\r\nbut neglected and suppressed in life where other rules become prevailing.\r\nWe find even in the oldest literature of Islam many complaints about the\r\nnegligence of the religious law by _Ulema_ in their struggle against\r\nthe practical judges, that is to say against the executors of actual\r\nlaw.”[518]\r\n\r\nThe last sentence quoted contains by implication a genuine distinction\r\nbetween the “religious law,” which may be called jurisprudence, and\r\nthe “actual law.” It is true that at the present time “actual law” in\r\nall Mohammedan lands consists only in a comparatively small proportion\r\nof precepts drawn from the _Sheri_; yet a body of precepts which today\r\nrequires an elaborate system of courts for its enforcement, and which\r\noffers a career to many thousands of living men as teachers, advisers,\r\nand judges, can hardly be adjudged a mere “doctrine of duties.”[519]\r\nUndoubtedly the _Sheri_ has suffered a gradual shifting of emphasis from\r\nits practical to its jurisprudential side; undoubtedly it has suffered\r\nprogressive encroachment upon the area of its practical application,\r\nbeginning in very early times and leading up to an invasion in force in\r\nthe nineteenth century by the principles, practice, and procedure of\r\nWestern Europe. But in the Ottoman Empire of the sixteenth century the\r\n_Sheri_ had no such inferior place. Even then, to be sure, it occupied\r\nby no means the whole field of practical law; but an examination of the\r\nquotations from the Venetian reports which were presented in an earlier\r\nchapter is of itself sufficient to show that at that time the _Sheri_\r\nheld the place of overwhelming preëminence in legal matters, in point of\r\nusefulness as well as of honor; that its practical precepts to the full\r\nextent of their formulated scope were the private law of the land; that\r\nits judges were of equal or greater authority and repute than were the\r\nhigh officers of government; that the latter were in most cases obliged\r\nto execute decisions of the former, their independent jurisdiction\r\nbeing confined to a limited class of persons, and to the decision of\r\nadministrative cases according to _Kanuns_ outside the field of the\r\nSacred Law.[520]\r\n\r\nThe Sacred Law reached out far beyond the conception of law in the West.\r\nIt was originally supposed to be sufficient for the entire government of\r\nthe Islamic state (of which there was believed to be but one upon the\r\nearth),[521] as well as for the minute regulation of the social, ethical,\r\nand religious life of all its members.[522] From two circumstances,\r\nhowever, it rapidly became inadequate as a political constitution: first,\r\nfrom the expansion of the original simple Islamic society into a great\r\nworld-power, with interests and relationships far more complex than had\r\nbeen dreamed of by the founders; and, second, from the fact that the Law,\r\nbelieved to be of divine origin,[523] was proclaimed unchangeable by its\r\nown provisions, and hence could not, except with extreme difficulty, be\r\nadapted to new responsibilities and times. Judges and jurists labored\r\nmanfully to provide elasticity by interpretation, but the task was too\r\ngreat to be completely successful. It became necessary, therefore, for\r\nprinces to supplement the Sacred Law by decrees of their own, a course in\r\nwhich they could not transgress the positive commands of the Sacred Law.\r\nBut even within the Law itself the jurists had allowed them considerable\r\nlatitude, by classifying its provisions under different heads as of\r\nvarious degrees of obligation: some acts were forbidden, some were\r\nadvised against, some were considered indifferent, some were recommended,\r\nand some were rigidly prescribed.[524] Princes were compelled to keep\r\nhands off all matters that were forbidden or prescribed; but in the wide\r\nintervening field there was much that they might do, and an even larger\r\nfield was left open in matters that were not touched at all by the Sacred\r\nLaw because they had lain outside the experience of the fathers of Islam\r\nor had developed since their time. In case of undoubted transgression of\r\nthe Sacred Law, the Moslem society, led by the _Ulema_, was considered\r\nabsolved from allegiance to the sovereign and justified in exercising the\r\nright of revolution.[525] The _Sheri_ was thus a written constitution for\r\nthe Ottoman Empire, not subject to amendment, but capable of some slight\r\nmodification by judicial and juristic decision and interpretation.[526]\r\nThe sultan had no power over it except as guardian, interpreter, and\r\nexecutor. The popular consent which allowed him to remain in authority\r\ndid not recognize in him any right to amend or abolish any part of the\r\nSacred Law.\r\n\r\nThe Ottoman sovereigns at first issued their new legislation as\r\n_firmans_, or ordinances,[527] but in the course of time they adopted\r\nfrom the Greek word κανών, or rule, the word _kanun_, which they applied\r\nto every general law. This Greek word as applied to law thus came to\r\nbe used in contrary senses in the East and the West. To the canon law\r\nof the West corresponded the _Sheri_, and to the civil or rather the\r\nnational law of the West, the _Kanuns_. It is to be noted, however, that\r\nthe _Sheri_ had wider sway in Turkey in the sixteenth century than the\r\ncanon law ever had in the West. Not only did it deal with a far larger\r\nfield, but its judges seem sometimes to have administered the _Kanuns_\r\nalso; they had, further, the support of the national government, whereas\r\nthe rival courts of the great officials had ordinarily a very limited\r\njurisdiction. The position of the ecclesiastical courts of the Christian\r\nsubjects was much more like that of similar courts in the West.[528]\r\n\r\nThe _Kanuns_ were issued in accordance with a general formula of the\r\nSacred Law. “The _Imâm_,” quotes Von Hammer, “has the right to make all\r\ncivil and political regulations which are demanded by prudence, the\r\ncircumstances, and the public welfare of the administration and the\r\nhighest executive power.”[529] The _Kanuns_ of previous sultans were not\r\nbinding upon a reigning sultan, except so far as he chose to put them in\r\nforce;[530] but the necessity of preserving a continuous administration\r\nled ordinarily to the carrying over to a new reign of all _Kanuns_ that\r\nwere actually in use. Reforms or readjustments were often accomplished by\r\nthe revival, with modifications, of old _Kanuns_, rather than by wholly\r\nnew legislation.[531]\r\n\r\nThe _Kanuns_ dealt with matters of military, financial, feudal, criminal,\r\nand police law, and with the law of ceremonies.[532] All these were also\r\ncovered in a measure by the Sacred Law, with two exceptions,—the feudal\r\nlaw and the law of ceremonies, which had to do with matters non-existent\r\nin the early Islamic state.[533] Within these two fields the sultans had\r\na free hand; in all others their _Kanuns_ were strictly supplementary and\r\nadministrative.[534]\r\n\r\nThe _Kanuns_ were issued separately to meet special circumstances. A\r\nnumber of them, when collected according to subject-matter or under the\r\nname of the sultan who issued them, constituted a _Kanun-nameh_, or book\r\nof laws. Each department of the government had its own _Kanun-nameh_, and\r\nthe laws of taxation for each _sanjak_ were collected into a separate\r\ngroup.[535] It is incorrect to think of a _Kanun-nameh_ of Mohammed II\r\nor of Suleiman as bearing any resemblance to the codes of Theodosius or\r\nJustinian. Not in magnitude, scope, character of contents, authorized\r\nunification, or prevailing authority can any comparison be made. The\r\n_Kanun-nameh_ of Mohammed II seems from its opening words to have had\r\nhis sanction as a collected body: “This is the _Kanun_ of my fathers and\r\nancestors, according to which my successors shall act from generation\r\nto generation.”[536] These words themselves show, however, that the\r\ncontents were not a unified body, but a collection of _Kanuns_ issued at\r\ndifferent times by former sultans as well as by the one who was reigning;\r\nand an examination of the contents bears out the statement. Nor does the\r\ncollection possess completeness in any sense. The first of the three\r\nparts deals mainly with the relative rank of officials, the second with a\r\nmiscellaneous lot of usages, chiefly ceremonial, the third with fines for\r\nsome serious offenses and with the salaries of some great officials. The\r\nwhole code is brief and shows great economy of legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LEGISLATION OF SULEIMAN\r\n\r\nSuleiman’s laws are not contained in a single _Kanun-nameh_. He is\r\nrightly named the Legislator by comparison with preceding Ottoman\r\nsultans, who were men of the sword and not of the pen; who, saying\r\nlittle, but doing much, had built up a great empire. With the empire,\r\ninstitutions which started from small beginnings had also grown great;\r\nbut, resting as they did on few written laws or ordinances, they had\r\ntended to reach a confused and complicated condition. The Ruling\r\nInstitution itself, gathered closely about the sultans and constantly\r\namended by them, was kept in excellent order; it needed no _Kanun-nameh_,\r\nand as a whole never had one, though many _Kanuns_ of rank, ceremony,\r\nsalary, and inheritance had reference to it. More remote matters,\r\nhowever, could not have so much attention. By the time of Suleiman’s\r\naccession, for example, the feudal system, and the bearing of the various\r\nforms of taxation and land tenure on the subject population, had come\r\ninto great disorder; criminal law also needed further development, and\r\nthe market and gild regulations of the cities of the empire demanded\r\nattention. Egyptian affairs were likewise in wild confusion. Already\r\ndisordered under the last Mameluke sultans,[537] they were now, by\r\nreason of the many deaths and confiscations in the war of conquest and\r\nthe setting-up of a new governing authority, imperatively demanding\r\nsettlement. In accordance with the needs of the time, therefore, Suleiman\r\nissued a large number of _Kanuns_, dealing especially with _timars_\r\nor fiefs, _rayahs_ or subjects, ceremonies, and criminal and market\r\nregulations, and comprising a constitution for Egypt, the _Kanun-nameh\r\nMisr_.[538] The latter appears to be the only body of _Kanuns_ which\r\nthe Legislator published as a whole, and which formed a complete\r\nsystem; issued in 1532,[539] it was probably inspired by Ibrahim,\r\nfollowing up his visit to Egypt in 1524.[540] The collection of the\r\ngreat _Mufti Ebu su’ud_, which is called the _Kanun-nameh_ of Suleiman,\r\ncontains chiefly his ordinances in regard to the land tenure and taxes\r\nof the subject Christians, together with a number of laws designed to\r\nregulate the feudal system, and a few relating to judges and legal\r\nprocesses.[541] Suleiman was great as a legislator only by comparison\r\nwith his predecessors. He set nothing in final order; and the ground\r\nhad to be gone over again within fifty years after his death, in the\r\nreign of Achmet I.[542] His legislation was doubly hindered: first, by\r\nthe conservatism of his people and his religion, which alike believed\r\nthat the old ways were the best, and which made radical departures\r\npractically impossible; and, second, by the weakness inherent in despotic\r\nlegislation, in which the distance of the law-giver from the subjects\r\naffected makes true adaptation to circumstances and complete enforcement\r\nimpossible of attainment. Because of the first hindrance, most of\r\nSuleiman’s laws professed an attempt to restore a former better state of\r\naffairs. As a matter of fact, they probably did not contain much more\r\nthan a statement in black and white, with necessary simplifications,\r\nof a confused body of practice that had grown up gradually, formulated\r\nin parts by the ordinances of his predecessors. Because of the second\r\nhindrance to his legislation, Suleiman was not able to put into\r\nsatisfactory and enduring order matters of such vital interest to the\r\npeople as the feudal and financial systems. Conferring only with a few\r\nreligious men and a limited number of high officials, aside from the\r\nshut-in members of his inner service, he could not possibly know how his\r\nregulations would bear upon the holders of small fiefs and the Christian\r\ntenants and tax-payers in remote parts of the empire. The officials who\r\nformulated the _Kanuns_ for him were only a little better able than he to\r\njudge of such matters; and the persons chiefly affected by the laws were\r\nnot consulted at all. Moreover, after issuing his laws the sultan could\r\nnot follow them up to see to their execution. In later times, orders to\r\nreadjust land titles were sometimes given, but with little further result\r\nthan to enrich officials by the bribes which they accepted for declaring\r\ntitles good, or by their confiscations of property on which the owners\r\ncould not pay enough.[543] Although official corruption was undoubtedly\r\nnot so bad under Suleiman as it became later, the suspiciously great\r\nwealth of high officials like Ibrahim and Rustem and the fact that fiefs\r\nand finances were in worse disorder than ever, after no great time had\r\nelapsed, gives evidence that his laws were not faithfully enforced.[544]\r\n\r\nNot much need be said about _Adet_ and _Urf_. _Adet_, or custom,\r\ncorresponds primarily to the body of unwritten regulations under which\r\nthe Turks of the steppe lands lived. As in most semi-civilized societies,\r\nit was at once far wider in scope, more rigid, and more binding, as\r\nenforced by popular opinion, than written laws in more advanced societies\r\nusually are. Something of these primitive characteristics were carried\r\nover into the Ottoman nation, with all its acquisition of new membership\r\nand incorporation of useful ideas. The conservative character of Islam\r\nstrengthened the tendency to perpetuate established custom. It has been\r\nremarked of the caliphate that in no other state have little causes near\r\nthe beginning produced such great effects, because of the tendency to\r\nfollow precedent minutely.[545] A very similar observation has been made\r\nin regard to the Ottoman state: “The changeless perpetuity of a primitive\r\ninstitution appears at every step in Ottoman history.”[546] What has been\r\nshall be, was a precept observed by the Ottomans in matters small and\r\ngreat. The principles of the Sacred Law, the accepted _Kanuns_, and the\r\nlocal _Adet_ of towns, districts, and manors had almost equally binding\r\nforce. In fact, to the unlettered citizen they probably formed one\r\nindistinguishable whole, which seemed almost a feature of the ordering of\r\nnature. Although such sentiments tended strongly toward stability, they\r\nwere a great hindrance to improvement. The early Ottomans had adopted\r\nnew ideas and institutions with great readiness; but, since they held to\r\nthem with equal tenacity, in the course of time they had no room left\r\nfor the admission of more novelties. As fusion and combination were\r\nprocesses little understood, the tendency was thus toward stagnation,\r\ninterrupted violently and for short periods when evils became too great\r\nto be endured. But, while the disposition to adhere to the established\r\norder was exceedingly strong among the Ottomans, _Urf_, the will of the\r\nsovereign was recognized to be superior to _Adet_, much as the Creator\r\nwas held to be superior to the ordinary operations of nature. The\r\nsultan’s will, however, penetrated but seldom so far as to the masses of\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n_Adet_ supplemented the Sacred Law and the _Kanuns_ in matters which\r\nthey did not cover.[547] It differed from district to district, as it\r\ndoes in the West. _Urf_ was the sovereign will of the reigning sultan;\r\nit was the seat and organ of sovereignty, being absolute to the full\r\nextent in which, according to the Sacred Law, God has delegated the\r\nright of legislation and rule to human beings.[548] The will of a past\r\nsultan could prevail only if it had been expressed in a _Kanun_ and\r\nwas enforced by the reigning sovereign. It was by the expression of\r\n_Urf_ that _Kanuns_ were issued or annulled and that _Adet_ was replaced\r\nby _Kanun_. So long as the Sacred Law was untouched, _Urf_ might be\r\nexercised oppressively, cruelly, or unworthily, without giving any one\r\nthe right to resist.[549] Against the _Sheri_, however, it had no force;\r\nany attempt to exercise it thus was an invitation to disaster.[550]\r\n\r\nSuleiman was never in danger from transgression of the Sacred Law. A\r\ndevout Moslem, whose piety increased in old age, he took seriously\r\nhis duty of enforcing its provisions, not even hesitating at such as\r\nwere unpopular, like the prohibition of wine-drinking,[551] or at\r\nsuch as demanded self-sacrifice on his part, like the disapproval of\r\nmusical instruments and silver plate.[552] If he did not enact measures\r\ndirectly to increase the welfare of the common people, his attempts to\r\nregulate the tax and tenancy systems tended to lighten their condition.\r\nMoreover, he used severe measures to put down extortion; and he strove\r\nby his market and police regulations to maintain justice, fairness, and\r\norder.[553]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VIZIERS\r\n\r\nOttoman writers represented their government under the figure of a tent\r\nsupported by four lofty pillars,[554]—the Viziers, the _Kaziaskers_, the\r\n_Defterdars_, and the _Nishanjis_. It is not safe to press comparisons\r\ntoo far, however; for, as a matter of fact, the pillars did not bear\r\nequal weight. All four groups of officials were necessary, but they were\r\nnot of like importance: the _Nishanjis_ were far less esteemed than the\r\nothers; the grand vizier, on the other hand, carried, from the time of\r\nSuleiman, so much greater a burden than any one else that he might be\r\ncompared to a central pillar which supported the entire tent.\r\n\r\nThe viziers were the chief councillors of the sultan for peace and war,\r\nadministration and justice; and they deliberated all important questions\r\nin the meetings of the Divan, which will be described later. The word\r\nvizier means burden-bearer, the idea being that an official so designated\r\nlifted from the shoulders of the sovereign the burden of state, and bore\r\nit upon his own shoulders. The number of viziers was not rigidly fixed,\r\nbut in the reign of Suleiman, there were ordinarily four, that being a\r\nsacred number with both Turks and Moslems.[555] All bore the title pasha,\r\nwhich was sparingly used in the sixteenth century. Ordinary viziers had\r\nno regular responsibilities besides their function as councillors; they\r\nhad great incomes from both regular and irregular sources, and kept large\r\nestablishments modeled on that of their master.[556]\r\n\r\nIn the time of Suleiman, the office of grand vizier reached the climax\r\nof a noteworthy development. Whereas formerly this official had been the\r\nsenior member of the sultan’s board of advisers, _primus inter pares_, he\r\nnow became a personage far above his fellow-viziers. His position came\r\nto differ from theirs not merely in degree, but in kind, a difference\r\ntypified by the fact that, in reporting to Suleiman after the meetings of\r\nthe Divan, none spoke but the grand vizier.[557] This development of the\r\noffice seems to have resulted from Suleiman’s willingness to entrust much\r\npower to a chosen instrument, who would thus relieve him of many of the\r\nimmense cares of empire. Ibrahim first held his master’s confidence for\r\nmany years. Later Rustem came to full power, supported by the wife and\r\nthe favorite daughter of the monarch. In Suleiman’s last years he left\r\nwell-nigh everything to Ali and to Mohammed Sokolli.[558]\r\n\r\nThe grand vizier thus came practically to wield the sovereign power of\r\nthe Ottoman state: the sultan might almost discharge his mind of public\r\ncare. That is why it became easy for Selim II and his successors to\r\nwithdraw into the harem, and devote most of their energies to carousing\r\nand debauchery. Had the position of the grand vizier been more secure,\r\nthis change might have been for the good of the Ottoman state, as\r\naffording a means of supplementing the scanty abilities of weak sultans\r\nby those of the ablest men of the empire. In the case of Mohammed\r\nSokolli, and of the Kiuprilis three generations later, such was to be\r\nthe fact. More often, however, the place of grand vizier was to be so\r\nthoroughly at the mercy of harem intrigue that only a master of this art\r\ncould retain his precarious position by immense efforts, such as would\r\nleave a mere remnant of his energies free for the service of the state.\r\nThe increase under Suleiman of the relative power of the grand vizier was\r\nthus a dangerous and eventually a disastrous development.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the grand vizier fully deserved the name of\r\nburden-bearer. Whereas even so earnest a sovereign as Suleiman appears to\r\nhave had a sufficiently leisurely life in time of peace, in spite of his\r\ngreat responsibilities as head of a despotic government,[559] his grand\r\nviziers must have been kept fully occupied. He that has been called the\r\ngreatest of all viziers, the _Nizam al-mulk_, spoke out of his experience\r\nwhen he said: “It is necessary that the sovereign consider with his\r\nvizier affairs of state and all that concerns the army, the finances\r\nand general prosperity. He must needs give attention to the measures\r\nwhich should be taken against the enemies of the empire and everything\r\nthat relates to the subject. All these matters give rise to a great many\r\nannoyances and preoccupations and put the spirit to torture, for they do\r\nnot leave a single instant of repose.”[560]\r\n\r\nThe grand vizier represented the sultan as head of the civil and\r\nmilitary administration and as supreme judge.[561] He appointed the\r\nhighest officials in these departments. He presided over long sessions\r\nof the Divan four days in the week. Some of his other duties, cares,\r\nand obligatory ceremonies appear in the catalogue of his ten special\r\nprerogatives:[562]—\r\n\r\n1. He had the care of the imperial seal, with which, on the days of the\r\nDivan, the doors of the treasury and chancery were sealed. The delivery\r\nof the seal was the symbol of investiture with the office of grand vizier.\r\n\r\n2. He might hold a Divan of his own at his palace in the afternoon. This\r\nwas an important session of court at which many cases, both great and\r\nsmall, were decided.[563]\r\n\r\n3. He had the right to be escorted by the _Chaush-bashi_ and all the\r\n_Chaushes_ from his palace to and from the sultan’s palace.\r\n\r\n4. He received visits of state from the _Kaziaskers_ and _Defterdars_\r\nevery Wednesday.\r\n\r\n5. He was honored by the appearance of the officers of the imperial\r\nstirrup every Monday in the Divan.\r\n\r\n6. He went in solemn procession on Friday to the mosque, escorted by\r\nthe _Chaushes_, the _Muteferrika_, and others of the outside service in\r\nturbans of ceremony.\r\n\r\n7. He received a weekly visit from the _Agha_ of the Janissaries, and a\r\nmonthly visit from the other viziers.\r\n\r\n8. He inspected the city of Constantinople and its markets, escorted by\r\nthe judge of Constantinople, the _Agha_ of the Janissaries, the provost\r\nof the markets, and the prefect of the city.\r\n\r\n9. He received a weekly visit of state from various magistrates and\r\n_Sanjak Beys_.\r\n\r\n10. He was honored at the two Bairams with official felicitations from\r\nthe other viziers, the _Defterdars_, the _Beys_, the magistrates, and the\r\ngenerals of the army.\r\n\r\nCustomary ceremonies alone were evidently enough to absorb a very large\r\npart of the grand vizier’s time; but they were a mere incident to the\r\nvast amount of administrative and judicial business that demanded his\r\nattention. It is not to be wondered at that the period of service in\r\nthis office was short, on the average. The post was a dangerous one;\r\nfor the possessor, with all his greatness, was the sultan’s _kul_, and\r\nliable to summary execution if he failed to give satisfaction. Of some\r\ntwo hundred men who served as grand viziers in the course of five hundred\r\nyears, about twenty were executed at the time of their deposition.[564]\r\n\r\nSuleiman’s grand viziers held office for comparatively long periods.[565]\r\nSeven, taken together, served him forty years; Mohammed Piri Pasha,\r\nwhom he found in office at his accession, served in all six years, and\r\nMohammed Sokolli, whom he left in office at his death, served fifteen\r\nyears. Thus in sixty-two years there were only nine in all. Three of them\r\ndeserve to be called great,—Ibrahim for his splendor, his breadth of\r\nmind, and his continuance in favor, Rustem for his financial shrewdness,\r\nand Mohammed Sokolli for his statesmanship. These three also served the\r\nlongest,—Ibrahim thirteen years, Rustem fifteen years in two periods, and\r\nMohammed Sokolli fifteen years without a break. Four of the nine ended\r\ntheir service at death, two were deposed and executed, three were simply\r\ndeposed. All except Mohammed Piri Pasha were Christian renegades, who had\r\nrisen as slaves to the highest honor of the empire.\r\n\r\nThe _Kaziaskers_ were, under the sultan and the grand vizier, the heads\r\nof the judiciary of the empire. They sat in the Divan, where they ranked\r\nnext to the grand vizier. Since they belonged to the Moslem Institution,\r\ndiscussion of their duties will be postponed to the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEFTERDARS, OR TREASURERS[566]\r\n\r\nThe great labor of accounting for the receipts and expenditures of\r\nthe Ruling Institution in practically all its capacities was under\r\nthe care of the two principal _Defterdars_, or treasurers, one for\r\nRumelia and one for Anatolia, aided by two of lower rank, one for\r\nAleppo and the southwest and one for the Danubian countries.[567] The\r\nprincipal _Defterdars_ were men of great position, with large incomes\r\nand households, and possessing the right of audience with the sultan\r\nin regard to matters of revenue.[568] Under them were twenty-five\r\ndepartments or bureaus, as instituted by the Conqueror, each with a\r\nchief, or _Khojagan_, who directed a number of clerks of different\r\ngrades. Between these and the _Defterdars_ were several intermediate\r\nofficials, of whom the most important were the two _Rusnamehjis_, or\r\nbook-keepers. The total personnel of the treasury department numbered\r\nmore than eight hundred.[569]\r\n\r\nA list of the twenty-five bureaus, or _kalems_, with a statement of\r\nthe provinces of each, will give an excellent idea of the complicated\r\nfinancial arrangements of the Ottoman government.[570] Taken as a whole,\r\nthey show in outline the economic substructure of the Ruling Institution,\r\nas well as that of the Moslem Institution, with exception of the sultan’s\r\nprivate treasury, out of which most of the inner service of the court\r\nwas paid, and of the provisions for the officers and judges of local\r\ngovernment:—\r\n\r\n1. The _Buyuk Rusnameh Kalemi_, or greater book-keeping bureau, was the\r\ncentral office to which all the accounts were brought from the other\r\nbureaus. Once or twice a year it drew up a statement of the finances of\r\nthe government. The income of this bureau seems to have been the greatest\r\nof all.[571]\r\n\r\n2. The _Bash Muhasebeh Kalemi_, or head bureau of accounts, was the\r\nlargest of all in numerical strength, and the second in income. It kept\r\naccount of tithes and taxes from the _sanjaks_, of munitions of war of\r\nall kinds, of the pay of the garrisons of Rumelia and Anatolia, of the\r\nreceipts and expenses of the intendants of buildings, the admiralty,\r\nthe kitchen, forage,[572] the mint, the three powder factories at\r\nConstantinople, Salonika, and Gallipoli, and of the inspector of\r\nartillery. This bureau received copies of all contracts made in the\r\npublic service, and it registered and countersigned the entire vast\r\nnumber of orders on the treasury.\r\n\r\n3. The _Anatoli Muhasebesi Kalemi_, or bureau of accounts for Anatolia\r\n(though it was by no means confined to Anatolia in its scope), kept\r\naccounts for certain domanial lands, for the garrisons in the Aegean\r\nIslands, and for the pensions of veteran soldiers.\r\n\r\n4. The _Suvari Mukabelesi Kalemi_, or bureau of control for the cavalry,\r\nkept account of the salaries of officials of the inner service, of the\r\n_Kapujis_, of the imperial stables, and of all the _Spahis_ of the Porte.\r\n\r\n5. The _Sipahi Kalemi_, or bureau of the _Spahis_, issued orders for the\r\npay of the _Spahis_ proper, which required to be countersigned by the\r\nhead of the fourth bureau.\r\n\r\n6. The _Silihdar Kalemi_, or bureau of _Silihdars_, was similar to the\r\nfifth bureau, except that it was concerned with the _Silihdars_.\r\n\r\n7. The _Haremein Muhasebeh Kalemi_, or bureau of accounts of the Holy\r\nCities of Mecca and Medina, kept the books of the religious endowments or\r\n_vakfs_ of the imperial mosques, of the salaries of all persons connected\r\nwith these mosques, of all other religious endowments in Constantinople\r\nand elsewhere in Rumelia, and of all Rumelian property dedicated to the\r\nHoly Cities. All certificates of nomination to service in connection\r\nwith mosques in Rumelia were prepared here, to be presented to the tenth\r\nbureau for the issuance of diplomas.\r\n\r\n8. The _Jizyeh Muhasebesi Kalemi_, or bureau of accounts for the\r\ncapitation tax, issued orders yearly for the payment of this tax\r\naccording to the estimated number of adult male subject Christians. A\r\nspecified number of these orders was sent to each district, which was\r\nheld responsible for a corresponding revenue.[573] The income of this\r\nbureau was only a little less than that of the second bureau.\r\n\r\n9. The _Mevkufat Kalemi_, or bureau of tributes, kept account of taxes\r\npaid in kind, of the quantity of grain in the public storehouses of\r\nConstantinople and the border fortresses, and of the grants of supplies\r\nfrom these stores to the several army corps and to the households of\r\nmilitary and civil _kullar_ who were required to follow the army.\r\n\r\n10. The _Maliyeh Kalemi_, or chancery bureau of the treasury department,\r\nissued diplomas to all employees of mosques who brought certificates\r\nof nomination from the seventh and twentieth bureaus, and to all\r\nadministrators of religious endowments and pensioners upon such funds;\r\nand it drew up for the approval of the sultan and the countersignature of\r\nthe _Defterdars_ all _firmans_, or administrative orders, that concerned\r\nthe treasury department.\r\n\r\n11. The _Kuchuk Rusnameh Kalemi_, or lesser book-keeping bureau, kept the\r\naccounts of the head _Kapujis_, the stewards, and the marine.\r\n\r\n12. The _Piadeh Mukabelesi Kalemi_, or bureau of control for the\r\ninfantry, kept the books of the Janissaries and the auxiliary corps of\r\nthe standing army.\r\n\r\n13. The _Kuchuk Evkaf Muhasebesi Kalemi_, or lesser bureau of accounts of\r\nreligious endowments, kept the accounts of all pensioners and attendants\r\nof the endowed public hospitals, soup-kitchens, insane asylums, and the\r\nlike.\r\n\r\n14. The _Buyuk Kalaa Kalemi_, or greater bureau of fortresses, kept\r\nrecord of the garrisons and of the militia who were liable for the\r\nservice of the fortresses of the Danube regions.\r\n\r\n15. The _Kuchuk Kalaa Kalemi_, or lesser bureau of fortresses, kept like\r\nrecords for fortresses in Albania and the Morea.\r\n\r\n16. The _Maaden Mukataasi Kalemi_, or bureau of mine leases, kept\r\naccount of the tribute required from gipsies, of the receipts from gold\r\nand silver mines in Europe and Asia, of the tributes from Moldavia and\r\nWallachia, and of the customs duties of Constantinople, Adrianople,\r\nSmyrna, Gallipoli, Chios, and other places.[574]\r\n\r\n17. The _Saliyaneh Mukataasi Kalemi_, or bureau of salaries, arranged the\r\nyearly pay of the captains of the fleet, and of the Khan of the Crimea\r\nand some of his officials.\r\n\r\n18. The _Khaslar Mukataasi Kalemi_, or bureau of domanial leases, kept\r\nthe books of the domain lands whose revenues were assigned to the chief\r\nladies of the harem, including the _Sultana Valideh_ and the sultan’s\r\ndaughters, and to the high officials of the government.[575]\r\n\r\n19. The _Bash Mukataasi Kalemi_, or head bureau of leases, cared for the\r\nrevenues from the domains in some lower Danubian lands, from the rice\r\nfields of Eastern Rumelia, from various salt works, from the fisheries of\r\nthe Aegean and Black seas, and from the forests.\r\n\r\n20. The _Haremein Mukataasi Kalemi_, or bureau of leases of the Holy\r\nCities, was charged with regard to Anatolia, as was the seventh bureau\r\nwith regard to Rumelia.\r\n\r\n21. The _Istambol Mukataasi Kalemi_, or bureau of leases for\r\nConstantinople, kept account of the domanial leases of Salonika, Tirhala,\r\nand Brusa, the market dues of Constantinople and Adrianople, the revenues\r\nfrom silk and from the manufacture of articles in gold and silver.\r\n\r\n22. The _Brusa Mukataasi Kalemi_, or bureau of the leases of Brusa, kept\r\naccount of the domanial leases in the neighborhood of that city.\r\n\r\n23. The _Avlonia Mukataasi Kalemi_, kept similar accounts for the island\r\nof Euboea, or Negropont.\r\n\r\n24. The _Kaffa Mukataasi Kalemi_ kept similar accounts for Kaffa and\r\ncertain domain lands of Anatolia.\r\n\r\n25. The _Tarishji Kalemi_, or bureau of dates, dated all public documents\r\nthat came from the other bureaus, and, at least in later times, prepared\r\nassignments on the public revenues on behalf of creditors of the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nSupplementary bureaus, attached to some of the others, were the bureau\r\nof confiscations and escheats to the crown, the bureau of the tax on\r\nanimals, and the bureau of the Christian churches and monasteries. An\r\nadditional office of great importance, called the _Oda_ of the treasury\r\ndepartment, attended to the correspondence of the _Defterdars_, to\r\ntheir reports to the grand vizier and the sultan, and to the forwarding\r\nof leases for sections of the crown lands. Attached to the treasury\r\ndepartment was a special court under a judge appointed by the _Kaziasker_\r\nof Rumelia, which was designed to adjust disputes between the department\r\nand private citizens.\r\n\r\nA _Defter-emini_, or book-keeper intendant, kept the records of the\r\nfief-holders and administered their estates during vacancies. He was\r\nwell paid, and had a staff of clerks.[576] He appears to have been\r\nindependent of the _Defterdars_. Two household treasurers were in charge\r\nof the sultan’s personal funds: the eunuch _Khazinehdar-bashi_, already\r\nmentioned as chief of the treasury chamber of pages, guarded the treasure\r\nstored there, and paid the members of the inner service; a second\r\nofficial, under the authority of the former and apparently called by the\r\nsame name, attended to the business of the sultan’s private purse outside\r\nthe palace.[577] The sultan had in the castle of the Seven Towers, or\r\n_Yedi-kuleh_, another deposit of treasure which was supposed to be very\r\nlarge.[578]\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of the treasury scheme give evidence that it\r\ndeveloped by a gradual growth without systematic revision at any time. As\r\nnew occasions for expenditure arose, they were put in charge of various\r\nbureaus; as new provinces or other sources of fresh income appeared, they\r\nwere either assigned to existing bureaus or given to new ones created\r\nfor the purpose. The bureaus of Istambol, Avlona, and Kaffa evidently\r\ndate from the time of the Conqueror; most of the others must have been\r\nolder. That the conquests of Selim and Suleiman were not administered\r\nfrom Constantinople is evident from a study of the bureaus, and from the\r\nseparate listing of the revenues from Syria, Mesopotamia, and Egypt in\r\ncontemporary estimates. Since the authorities give no source of revenue\r\nfor the first bureau, which nevertheless seems to have had the greatest\r\nincome of all, it is probable that the tribute from the later conquests\r\nwas paid into that department, and by it apportioned to bureaus of\r\nexpenditure, such as the fourth, the eleventh, and the twelfth. It is\r\nworthy of notice to what an extent the sources of revenue were ear-marked\r\nfor expenditure. The second bureau received the tithes and taxes of the\r\n_sanjaks_, and paid them out for munitions of war, the maintenance of\r\ngarrisons, and the expenses of the intendants of the outside service of\r\nthe court. The third bureau received the revenue from certain domanial\r\nlands, and supported the garrisons of the Aegean Islands and soldiers\r\nwho had been pensioned. The eighteenth bureau administered domanial\r\nlands for the support of the harem and high officials. The ninth bureau\r\nreceived and delivered to the army taxes paid in kind. The seventh,\r\nthirteenth, and twentieth bureaus took revenues from lands assigned by\r\nreligious endowment for the support of the Moslem Institution and certain\r\nbeneficiaries, and paid them out as stipulated by the givers.\r\n\r\nInstead of one treasury, into which all revenues should come and out\r\nof which all disbursements should be made, there were fifteen or more\r\nbureaus which received, and as many which spent; and some of those which\r\nboth received and spent were, except for the oversight of the first\r\nbureau, practically independent institutions. A distinct tendency toward\r\ndecentralization of management is manifest. Whatever could be set off\r\nby itself was made as nearly independent as possible, subject only to\r\ninspection and supervision. This policy undoubtedly resulted from the\r\ndespotic character of the government. Since one man, the founder of a\r\ndespotic state, can attend to only a limited number of duties, he is\r\nforced, as his power develops, to assign more and more responsibilities\r\nto subordinates. The method which most relieves the central management is\r\nto entrust definite duties to definite groups of men, to support these\r\nwith sufficient revenues, and then to leave them to themselves. If things\r\ngo wrong in any department, the central authority intervenes, punishes\r\nseverely those who were responsible, sets things to rights forcibly,\r\nand again leaves the department to itself. The system is very dangerous\r\nunless the central management can be kept constantly strong and able to\r\nassume full control promptly and effectively. This was the case in the\r\nOttoman Empire until after the time of Suleiman.\r\n\r\nA yet stronger tendency toward decentralization appeared in connection\r\nwith local government. Each _Beylerbey_ had his own _mufti_, _reis\r\neffendi_, and _defterdar_, with a considerable body of clerks, who\r\nadvised him, recorded his decisions, attended to the revenues from the\r\nestates assigned for the support of his household, and kept account of\r\nthe fief-holders in his dominion.[579] Each _Sanjak Bey_ again had his\r\ngroup of assistants, with similar duties on a lesser scale.[580] Some\r\ngenerations later the extension of this decentralization was to become a\r\ngreat evil.\r\n\r\nThe duties of the bureaus of the treasury department reveal clearly the\r\nlimited purposes and activities of the Ottoman government. The support\r\nof the Ruling Institution as standing army, court, and government was\r\nprovided for; the revenues assigned by former sultans and by private\r\nindividuals to the support of the Moslem Institution in its religious\r\nand charitable aspects were supervised; the navy was provided for; and\r\nthe _Khan_ of the Crimea was pensioned. But nothing was done for the\r\ngreat mass of the population. They were expected to furnish the means for\r\nthese activities; and the duty of the most conscientious sovereign was\r\nfully performed if he provided that they should labor unmolested, and\r\nshould not be burdened with taxation beyond their ability to pay. Under a\r\nstrong ruling hand the Ottoman system easily maintained order through the\r\nstanding and feudal armies, but it did not so easily regulate the burden\r\nof taxation. This subject deserves special consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTAXATION IN THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE[581]\r\n\r\nA distinction was drawn between taxes authorized by the Sacred Law,\r\nwhich were called legal, and all others, which were called arbitrary\r\nas depending on the will of the sovereign. The early Islamic system\r\nof taxation, taken over, it would seem, from the Sassanian Persian\r\nEmpire,[582] was extremely simple. No taxes were laid except on land and\r\non persons. The lands of Arabia and Bosra were charged with a tithe,\r\nor _’ushr_, of their produce. Other conquered lands were more heavily\r\nburdened, being assessed with a _kharâj_, or tax payable in money, and\r\nwith a share of the produce, which might be from the tenth to the half\r\naccording to the fertility of the land. The tax on persons, the _jizyeh_,\r\nwas limited to a poll or capitation tax on adult male subjects who were\r\nnot Moslems. The _’ushr_, the _kharâj_, and the _jizyeh_ were the only\r\ntaxes recognized by the Sacred Law.\r\n\r\nOther methods of taxation were utilized almost from the beginning.\r\nWhen, with the conquest of Syria and Egypt, the Byzantine Empire was\r\nentered, it did not seem best to sweep away the customs, tolls, and other\r\nimpositions which drew revenue from trade. As such taxes did not rest on\r\na constitutional foundation, they were discouraged by some legists; but\r\nthey became more and more necessary as a worldly government developed,\r\nand as the revenues from a large part of the land were set aside for\r\nreligious foundations.\r\n\r\nThe early Islamic state also had a vast source of revenue in booty.\r\nFour-fifths of this went to the generals and soldiers actually concerned\r\nin conquest; the remaining fifth was sent to Medina. After the capital\r\nhad been removed from Arabia, the “Prophet’s fifth” was still claimed for\r\nthe support of legists and judges.\r\n\r\nThe Islamic system, with its distinction of legal and arbitrary taxes,\r\nits rules regulating the distribution of booty, and its custom of\r\ndevoting revenues to religious foundations, was taken up by the Ottoman\r\nstate. At the same time the feudal system, based upon both Seljuk and\r\nByzantine example, was applied to a large part of the lands conquered\r\nfrom Christians, an arrangement which yielded considerable revenue for\r\nthe support of individuals; and a host of Seljuk and Byzantine imposts\r\nlengthened the list of arbitrary taxes. Much land was retained as\r\nimperial domain, perhaps in many cases land that was already domain of\r\nthe Byzantine emperors and other rulers whom the Ottomans dispossessed.\r\nThe conquests in Cilicia, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Egypt were left\r\nunder the old regulations, with some clearing away of arbitrary taxes,\r\nand preparing of cadasters in the Turkish language.[583] Hungary was\r\ncarefully cadastered, to be administered thus during a century and a\r\nhalf.[584] Special arrangements and exemptions were made for the foreign\r\ncolonists, of a character similar to old Byzantine and Saracen treaties\r\nand agreements.\r\n\r\nAs a result of all this, the system of taxation in the Ottoman Empire was\r\nvery complex. It contained a great variety of taxes,—on persons, land,\r\ntrade, animals, produce, mines, markets, and the like,—differing from\r\n_sanjak_ to _sanjak_ and from town to town; and it collected its income\r\nby various methods and through various agencies. The details of the\r\nsystem cannot be considered here, but a few general observations may be\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nUntil the time of Mohammed II the revenues were administered directly by\r\nthe treasury department, but this method led to so many malversations\r\nat the cost of the government that he changed the system to one of\r\ntax-farming. By this means the government became sure of its money. The\r\nmalversations did not stop, however, but went on now at the cost of\r\nthe tax-payers.[585] The taxes of regions of large size were sold by\r\nthe treasury, usually to high officers among the _kullar_, who did not\r\nintend to collect the taxes themselves, but sold them again by sections.\r\nThis process might be repeated several times, till in the end it would\r\nprobably be, not Ottomans, but Christians and Jews who applied the screws\r\nto the unfortunate subjects.[586] The amount wrung from them might easily\r\nbe double what the government received.\r\n\r\nThe strongly conservative tendency of the Ottoman people showed markedly\r\nin regard to taxation. The taxes that had been agreed upon of old were\r\npaid, but a general revision of the system in the direction of uniformity\r\nwas never thought of. The revenues of the empire were thus extremely\r\ninelastic.[587] A special war contribution might be laid, as was done\r\nby Suleiman before Mohacs,[588] and requisitions might be made upon the\r\ninhabitants of a region through which the army passed; but a permanent\r\nincrease of revenue was practically impossible. The tendency was in the\r\nother direction. As the value of money declined, not without assistance\r\nfrom the sultans,[589] all revenues payable in agreed sums declined\r\nlikewise. Payments in kind from agricultural products may have increased\r\nfor a time under local peace and security, but in the end they were to\r\ndiminish also. Treaties with Western nations were so favorable to the\r\nlatter commercially as to prevent the receipt of extensive revenues\r\nfrom foreign customs duties; and such trade must have increased with the\r\ngrowth of the empire and the increasing luxury of the court. But on the\r\nwhole the sultan’s receipts from taxation, aside from the effect of new\r\nconquests, and allowing for the fluctuations in tithes due to good and\r\nbad harvests, were probably not far from stationary.\r\n\r\nThe receipts from the sultan’s fifth of booty taken in war, which\r\nincluded slaves, must have been considerable up to the end of Suleiman’s\r\nreign. They were all devoted, however, to the support of the Moslem\r\nInstitution.[590] Tribute came in from several countries, as Moldavia,\r\nWallachia, Transylvania, Ragusa, from Venice for Cyprus, and after\r\n1547 from Austria for Hungary. This was forced up whenever possible\r\nas punishment for unrest, and was shared by the sultan with high\r\nofficials.[591] Confiscations of the property of executed persons\r\nbrought several great sums to Suleiman. The estates of _kullar_ who\r\ndied without children, and the tithes of the estates of those who left\r\nchildren, constituted a valuable though irregular revenue.[592] The great\r\ntreasure of the prince of Gujarat came to Suleiman after the prince’s\r\ndeath.[593] Something was realized from the administration of the estates\r\nof fief-holders who died without sons; but the lands of these had to\r\nbe granted again before long in order to keep up the strength of the\r\nfeudal army.[594] Fees connected with the administration of justice went\r\ndirectly to the support of the judges and other officials concerned.[595]\r\nWith regular taxation nearly stationary, the increase from extraordinary\r\nsources did not keep pace with advancing expenditures.[596]\r\n\r\nSuleiman’s expenses grew particularly in regard to the fleet and the\r\nhousehold. Some Western writers remarked that the sultan was put to no\r\nexpense by war, since his standing army required to be paid in peace as\r\nwell as in war, and since the remainder of his troops came at their own\r\nexpense.[597] It is true that his additional expenditure was small as\r\ncompared with that for a contemporary Western army, built from a small\r\npermanent nucleus by the hiring of mercenaries and the levy of national\r\ntroops which had to be supported by the treasury; but the sultan had\r\nto replace large quantities of munitions of war that were used up or\r\ndestroyed, and great numbers of animals of transport. Moreover, the\r\nJanissaries and _Spahis_ had to be placated at times by presents, and it\r\nwas more expensive to feed the army in the field than in the barracks.\r\nBut the fleet was a great and growing expense, despite the extent to\r\nwhich it was supported by raiding and by revenues from North Africa;[598]\r\nand the luxury and splendor of the Magnificent Sultan’s court grew apace.\r\nIn spite of fresh conquests and large confiscations, therefore, Suleiman\r\nlearned to feel the need of money. He found it necessary to compel his\r\ngreat officials to help him, by exacting sums of money from them at the\r\ntime of their appointment.[599] These sums were moderate, but, as already\r\npointed out, they set a fatal example.[600]\r\n\r\n\r\nSULEIMAN’S INCOME\r\n\r\nSuleiman’s revenues have been variously estimated. The lowest, and\r\nprobably the most accurate for the field which it covers, during\r\nthe years between 1530 and 1537, is that given by Junis Bey, chief\r\ninterpreter of the Ottoman court, and Alvise Gritti, natural son of the\r\nDoge of Venice, and business partner of the grand vizier Ibrahim.[601]\r\nJunis Bey says: “The income of the Great Turk from _kharâj_ or tribute\r\namounts to 1,300,000 ducats from Anatolia and Greece, and 1,600,000\r\nducats from Egypt, and 700,000 ducats from Syria and 150,000 ducats from\r\nMesopotamia and 250,000 ducats from his farms, the islands which are\r\nunder him, and the customs of Constantinople and Pera. Signor Alvise\r\nGritti says that the income is rather more than less than I have stated,\r\nand I think that the expenses of the Porte or of the Seigneur’s court\r\nconsume the entire income or a little less.”[602]\r\n\r\nThe total regular revenue of Suleiman would thus have been about four\r\nmillion ducats.[603] Two estimates made twenty-five or thirty years\r\nlater differ notably, however. They indicate about half as much revenue\r\nfrom Syria and Egypt, allow several times as much from the farms and the\r\ncustoms duties, and introduce taxes on mines and salt works, tithes paid\r\nin kind, the animal tax, tributes, escheats, and document fees.[604]\r\nAccording to their estimated total of seven or eight million ducats,\r\nit would seem that a million ducats ought to be added to Junis Bey’s\r\nestimate for the mines, salt works, and tributes, and a million for the\r\nother revenues mentioned. This would give an estimate of six million\r\nducats for Suleiman’s revenues in the early part of his reign. Toward\r\nthe close of his reign, after large territories in Europe and Asia had\r\nbeen incorporated, and after Rustem had made new arrangements, the total\r\namount was probably seven or eight million ducats.[605] The bullion value\r\nof six million ducats is less than fourteen million dollars. If, then,\r\nthe purchasing power of money be estimated at five times what it is now,\r\nthe regular revenue of Suleiman’s government was equivalent to less than\r\nseventy million dollars nowadays, no large sum for so great an empire. It\r\nis necessary to remember, however, that this by no means covers all the\r\nexpenses for public purposes within the empire. It probably includes none\r\nof the revenues devoted to the Moslem Institution, nor those specifically\r\nassigned by feudal grant to the officers of local government; certainly\r\nit does not include those gathered by the permanent fief-holders and\r\nused for their own support, which probably amounted to about twice as\r\nmuch more.[606] Allowing for all this, the sum total, the equivalent\r\nof perhaps two hundred million dollars, for all the expenses of central\r\nand local government was small in proportion to population, according to\r\nmodern standards. Had there been no extortion, the people of the empire\r\nwould not have been burdened heavily. Even with it, as indicated already,\r\nthey probably did not suffer greatly in Suleiman’s time.[607]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NISHANJI OR CHANCELLOR\r\n\r\nThe chancery department of the Ottoman government seems not to have\r\nreached such a stage of development in the sixteenth century as had the\r\ntreasury department; certainly it was not so conspicuous. Contemporary\r\nwriters give so little information about it that it is hard to draw a\r\nreasonably complete picture of it. They mention several of the officials\r\nwho were prominent in the department in later times; but evidently those\r\nof the earlier period were not under the same relationships to each other\r\nas were later ones who bore the same titles. The _Nishanji-bashi_, often\r\ncalled simply the _Nishanji_, was clearly the chief, but other details\r\nare not easily to be ascertained. It seems necessary, therefore, to\r\ndescribe the Ottoman chancery as it was two centuries after Suleiman’s\r\ndeath, and then to endeavor to conjecture what it was in his time.[608]\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of the eighteenth century the Ottoman government\r\nhad three ministers of state and six under-secretaries of state. The\r\nthree ministers were the _Kiaya-bey_, the _Chaush-bashi_, and the _Reis\r\nEffendi_, the last named being by far the most important. The _Kiaya-bey_\r\nwas the substitute or lieutenant of the grand vizier, and attended\r\nespecially to affairs of the interior and of war; under him were a\r\nnumber of officials who formed connecting links between the grand vizier\r\nand the various groups of _kullar_ in the household and the army. The\r\n_Chaush-bashi_ was at the same time second official in the grand vizier’s\r\ncourt of justice, minister of police, introducer of ambassadors, grand\r\nmarshal of the court, and chief of the _Chaushes_. To assist him in the\r\nexecution of these varied functions, he had a large number of under\r\nofficers and clerks. The _Reis Effendi_, whose full title was _Reis\r\nul-Khuttab_, “Chief of the Men of the Pen,” was minister of foreign\r\naffairs, secretary of state, and chancellor. In the first capacity he was\r\nprominent in international relations; in the second he was responsible\r\nfor the preparation of the addresses and reports which the grand vizier\r\nmade to the sultan; in the third, he was head of the three bureaus of\r\nthe chancery. In charge of these under him were a _Beylikji_, or general\r\ndirector of the three bureaus, a _Terjuman Divani Humayun_, or chief\r\ninterpreter, and an _Ameji_, who drew up the grand vizier’s reports to\r\nthe sultan for the inspection of the _Reis Effendi_.\r\n\r\nOf the three bureaus, the _Beylik Kalemi_ prepared, recorded, or\r\ntransmitted, as was proper in each case, _Kanuns_, treaties, and all\r\n_firmans_ that did not concern the treasury department. The _Tahvil\r\nKalemi_ prepared the diplomas of governors, of judges of large towns, and\r\nof fief-holders. The _Ruus Kalemi_ made out certificates for the clerks\r\nof all bureaus, for _Kapuji-bashis_, professors in endowed colleges,\r\nadministrators of religious endowments, pensioners on the treasury or\r\non religious benefactions, and soldiers of the auxiliary corps of the\r\nregular army. Together the three bureaus kept employed about one hundred\r\nand fifty clerks of three grades, provided for by fiefs. The _Nishanji’s_\r\nsole duty was to authenticate _firmans_ sent to the provinces, by\r\ntracing at the head of each document the sultan’s _tughra_, or official\r\nsignature. He had no influence on the conduct of business, but, as\r\nevidence of past greatness, he ranked above even the _Reis Effendi_ on\r\nceremonial occasions.[609]\r\n\r\nThe under-secretaries were attached by pairs to the ministers. The\r\n_Teshrifatji_, or master of ceremonies, and the _Kiaya Katibi_, or\r\nprivate secretary, of the _Kiaya-bey_ were attached to the _Kiaya-bey_.\r\nThe greater and lesser _Teskerejis_, or masters of petitions, were\r\nattached to the _Chaush-bashi_. The _Beylikji_, mentioned above as head\r\nof the three bureaus of the chancery, and the _Mektubji_, or private\r\nsecretary of the grand vizier, in which office he was assisted by a\r\nbureau of thirty clerks, were attached to the _Reis Effendi_.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that all the functions of the officials and bureaus\r\ndescribed above must have been performed in some fashion in the time of\r\nSuleiman. The conservative character of Turkish institutions simplifies\r\nthe problem of determining how they were performed. It has been seen,\r\npartly by external and partly by internal evidence, that the bureaus\r\nof the treasury department persisted from the time of Mohammed II to\r\nthe end of the eighteenth century with few changes. Accordingly, the\r\ninference may fairly be made that the same was true of the chancery\r\ndepartment. Moreover, the chief officials of the later date are mentioned\r\nin sixteenth-century writings, among them the _Kiaya_ of the grand\r\nvizier, the _Chaush-bashi_, and the _Reis Effendi_; Junis Bey held the\r\nposition of chief interpreter;[610] and the duties of Suleiman’s master\r\nof ceremonies must have been important. The great change in the chancery\r\nin the interval was the decline of the _Nishanji_ from the highest place\r\nin the department to one of little importance, and the rise of the _Reis\r\nEffendi_ from a subordinate place to the top. From of old the _Nishanji_\r\nhad had the duty of affixing the sultan’s signature to documents; but\r\nin early Ottoman days, when the pen was of very little consequence in\r\ncomparison with the sword, he had been held in small esteem. He was\r\nresponsible, however, for the accurate and legal formulation of the\r\npapers which he signed; and as the nation grew his importance increased,\r\ntill by the sixteenth century he had become a great official, clearly the\r\nhead of the chancery department, and the recipient of a large salary.\r\nA description of about the year 1537 says of the _Nishanji_: “There is\r\na _Teskereji-bashi_, who has the duty of engrossing the ordinances\r\nand commands of the prince and the court, when it has transmitted them\r\nto him, and is like a general secretary of the commands, or recorder\r\nof the documents of the prince, which are called _Teskereh_; and it is\r\nalso his duty, in consultation with the pashas, to revise the writings\r\nand take care that they contain no ambiguous expressions, as though\r\nhe were a keeper of the seals. The present occupant of the office has\r\nseven thousand ducats of revenue from fiefs, and a large number of\r\nslaves, and other lesser recorders who also prepare commands, licenses,\r\nsafe-conducts, and other letters as there may be need. These are paid\r\nhere for their trouble, and they may receive three or four hundred\r\nlivres. It is said that the present [_Nishanji_] is so just a man, that\r\nhe has never in his life received a _sou_ from any one with whom he has\r\ntransacted business.”[611]\r\n\r\nThe _Reis Effendi_ was at that time, it would seem, little more than\r\nrecording secretary of the Divan.[612] The reasons for the later change\r\nin the relative importance of these two officials probably lay in the\r\nwithdrawal of the sultan into his inner palace, and the development\r\nof foreign relations. As the sultan became more sequestered, the\r\n_Nishanji’s_ personal relation to him was gradually cut off; for the\r\nsame reason the grand vizier came to be more heavily burdened, and left\r\nmore responsibility on the _Reis Effendi_. Beginning with Suleiman’s\r\nreign, relations with the Western European nations became ever closer and\r\nmore complicated. Cared for in his time by the grand viziers Ibrahim,\r\nRustem, and Ali,[613] they were entrusted in later reigns to the _Reis\r\nEffendi_. Presently, then, this official displaced the _Nishanji_ at the\r\nhead of the chancery, and the latter was gradually reduced almost to the\r\nfunctions of a name-stamp. Aside from this important difference, and the\r\ngeneral fact that the business of the chancery was not so extensive in\r\nSuleiman’s time as it became later, and that the functions of separate\r\nofficials had not come to be so rigidly defined, the inference may be\r\nmade that the description of the late eighteenth century holds good\r\ngenerally of the Ottoman chancery of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nLittle evidence appears as to the status of the personnel of the treasury\r\nand chancery departments. The upper officials were drawn from the\r\nquieter and more studious members of the school of pages;[614] in the\r\ntime of Mohammed II the _Nishanji_ might be drawn from the ranks of the\r\n_Ulema_.[615] Junis Bey refers to the employees of the bureaus sometimes\r\nas slaves and sometimes as companions or scribes. They were paid not in\r\nmoney but by fiefs. Near the close of Suleiman’s reign, it is said, the\r\nchancery clerks were Turks, whereas they had been Christians and Greeks\r\nnot long before, and had written their documents in Greek.[616] Whether\r\nor not this be true, the books of the treasury department had been kept\r\nin Turkish from the first;[617] but it does not follow, of course, that\r\nthe clerks of this department had always been Ottomans, or that, if\r\nthey were, they had been regularly either Moslem-born or renegades. The\r\ngeneral reasons which led the sultan to build the Ruling Institution\r\nout of slaves in its other aspects would tend to operate here also; on\r\nthe other hand, the nature of the work demanded persons of quiet tastes\r\nand, for many positions, those of considerable learning in language and\r\nlaw, and such persons were more easily to be found in the Moslem-born\r\npopulation than among the Christian subjects or renegades. It would\r\nseem that in Suleiman’s time, or shortly before, the personnel of the\r\nchancery changed from Christian-born to Moslem-born. Naturally, then, the\r\npersonnel of the treasury would have been likely to undergo a similar\r\ntransformation at the same time.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that when Turks dismount from their horses, they\r\nbecome bureaucrats and paper-scribblers.[618] Undoubtedly the Ottoman\r\ngovernment gave evidence of the truth of this statement. The twenty-five\r\nbureaus of the treasury and the appended bureaus, the three bureaus of\r\nthe chancery, the treasuries and chanceries of _Beylerbeys_ and _Sanjak\r\nBeys_, the offices of the generals of cavalry and infantry, and of the\r\n_Umena_ and other household officials without and within, contained some\r\nthousands of men whose whole time was occupied in writing, recording, and\r\ntransmitting laws, ordinances, diplomas, nominations, projects, deeds,\r\ngrants, orders for pay, receipts, reports, addresses, petitions, answers,\r\nand the like. The existence of so many component institutions, connected\r\nonly at the top and paralleling each other’s activities both near and\r\nfar, together with the custom of verifying, authenticating, and recording\r\nmany papers in different bureaus and by different officials, created a\r\nvast and growing amount of red tape that in time was greatly to hinder\r\nall government business. Even in Suleiman’s day it seems to have been\r\nthe practice on the part of clerks and officials to demand a private fee\r\nfor each act of writing or signing or stamping or recording or approving\r\nor inspecting.[619] In the time of prosperity, however, this practice\r\ncan hardly have been so vexatious and dilatory as it became later. The\r\nbureaucratic tendency was no doubt based on a desire to keep everything\r\nin order by checks and cross-recording; but in the end it defeated its\r\nobject by employing such a multiplicity of devices that order was lost in\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DIVAN OR COUNCIL[620]\r\n\r\nIn a land where the law was nearly fixed, and where whatever power of\r\nlegislation was allowed was definitely lodged in one man, the only\r\ndeliberation possible was on administrative and judicial subjects. The\r\noversight of these matters was given in charge to a council, the Divan,\r\nwhich held long sessions four times each week throughout the year in\r\ntime of peace, unless perhaps in the month of fasting. This council was\r\ncomposed of _ex officio_ members who represented (when those who came\r\nonly on special days are added to those who came each day) all the great\r\ncomponent parts of the Ruling Institution. The Moslem Institution also\r\nwas represented in the two _Kaziaskers_; for the grand vizier and the\r\nDivan constituted not only the supreme council of administration but\r\nthe supreme court of the empire. It was thus not strictly a part of\r\nthe Ruling Institution, but rather the cap-stone of both institutions,\r\nthe body that gave final unity, immediately under the sultan, to the\r\norganization of the empire.\r\n\r\nIn former times the sultan had presided at the Divan. Suleiman did not,\r\nand he has been greatly blamed for discontinuing the custom.[621] It\r\nis not impossible to sympathize with him, however, for he thus freed\r\nhimself from a great burden; to spend several hours in deliberation on\r\nfour days of each week during a lifetime is a prospect from which any\r\nman would shrink. Nevertheless, it was a serious rift in both of the\r\ngreat institutions of the empire at the most dangerous place, and its\r\neffect was decidedly to hasten their disintegration. Suleiman kept the\r\nDivan under control by means of a grated window in the wall of the room\r\nwhere it met.[622] Not knowing when he might be listening there, his\r\ncouncillors had always to speak as if he were present with them.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the councillors at the hall of the Divan, their entry,\r\ntheir places for sitting or standing, their rank at the simple meal of\r\nwhich they partook while there, the order of their going in to audience\r\nwith the sultan afterward, and the manner of their departure, were all\r\naccording to _Kanun_ or equally rigid custom. At a later time the details\r\nof these ceremonies were all minutely specified.[623] Probably they were\r\nnot so elaborate in the time of Suleiman, but contemporary writings show\r\nthem already considerably developed.\r\n\r\nThe sessions of the Divan have been described so often that it is not\r\nnecessary to go into detail here. Soon after sunrise on Saturday, Sunday,\r\nMonday, and Tuesday the officials who were to participate came to the\r\npalace, accompanied by their secretaries, ushers, body-guards, and other\r\nattendants. They passed the second gate of the palace in the inverse\r\norder of rank, and waited at their prescribed places in the hall of the\r\nDivan until the grand vizier approached, accompanied by his retinue, when\r\nall came out and took places according to rank in two lines, between\r\nwhich the grand vizier entered. Those who had the right then followed him\r\nin by pairs, and once more took their places.[624] Officials who might\r\nbe summoned waited in antechambers near; and attendants, guards, and\r\nsoldiers, stood at suitable distances.\r\n\r\nThe grand vizier sat Turkish fashion in the middle of a long sofa which\r\nextended round three sides of the hall. On his right sat the other\r\nviziers (unless one or more happened to be absent on a special mission),\r\nand beyond them, on the sofa at the end of the room, the _Nishanji_. On\r\nthe grand vizier’s left were the two _Kaziaskers_, and beyond them the\r\n_Defterdars_.[625] The _Beylerbeys_ of Anatolia and Greece, and, after\r\nBarbarossa’s appointment, the _Kapudan Pasha_, sat beyond the viziers\r\non the right. The _Agha_ of the Janissaries also had a place, and the\r\nchief interpreter was often needed. Other generals and high officials\r\nmight be summoned; heads, officials, and clerks of bureaus were at hand;\r\nand _Chaushes_, _Kapuji-bashis_, and _Kapujis_ were in readiness to be\r\nsent on errands and missions. Before the grand vizier, when judicial\r\nbusiness was being considered, stood the _Teskerejis_, or masters\r\nof petitions. On the floor at his left sat the _Reis Effendi_. The\r\n_Kapujilar-kiayasi_, or grand chamberlain of the household, was present;\r\nand the _Chaush-bashi_, as grand marshal of the court, here bearing the\r\nadditional title of _Bey_ of the Divan, saw that all went according to\r\nrule. After greetings and other formalities the business was taken up in\r\norder of importance.[626] Great questions, like proposals of ambassadors,\r\nthe condition of the provinces, and the possibility or desirability of\r\nwar were discussed briefly by the viziers, the others present being\r\ncalled upon to speak if their views were desired. The grand vizier either\r\ndeclared the decision on such matters, subject to the sultan’s approval,\r\nor reserved the decision for the master.[627] Lesser matters were decided\r\nby the viziers individually, or were referred by them to the other great\r\nofficials present, or to an official in attendance outside. Much of the\r\ntime there was no general deliberation, but several affairs might be\r\nconsidered by different members of the Divan simultaneously. Lawsuits\r\nwere presented to the grand vizier by the masters of petitions, and the\r\nparties might appear to plead their own cases, bringing witnesses. The\r\ngrand vizier turned over many cases to the _Kaziaskers_. All business was\r\ndone with despatch, and a large amount was accomplished. Decisions were\r\nbriefly formulated, without discussion of the reasons for action. The\r\n_Reis Effendi_ and lesser secretaries and clerks wrote down carefully all\r\nthat was decided upon. After the sultan had signified his approval at the\r\nclose of a Divan, the decisions were irrevocable.\r\n\r\nDuring and also at the close of the session, which might last seven or\r\neight hours,[628] a simple meal of bread, meat, rice, fruit, and water\r\nwas served to all who were in attendance within and without the hall of\r\nthe Divan. To meet the expense of this, four days’ pay was reserved each\r\nyear from the salaries of all who were expected to attend.[629] Order\r\nwas kept most carefully among all who were present within and without\r\nthe hall of the Divan, and absolute silence was preserved, except for\r\nsuch movements and conversation as were necessary to the transaction of\r\nbusiness. Any disturber of order and quiet was taken away and immediately\r\nbastinadoed.\r\n\r\nAfter the day’s work was done, which might be about noon in summer\r\ntime or toward sunset in the winter, those officials of the Divan\r\nwho had the right of audience went to the hall of audience to meet\r\nthe sultan. They were the viziers, _Kaziaskers_, and _Defterdars_\r\nregularly, and the _Beylerbeys_ and the _Agha_ of the Janissaries when\r\nthey had business;[630] the _Defterdars_, however, received audience\r\non Sundays and Tuesdays only. The _Kaziaskers_ entered first, and\r\nwhen their business had been approved they went to the gate and held\r\ncourt. The _Beylerbeys_, the _Defterdars_, and the viziers entered the\r\naudience chamber together. The _Beylerbeys_ transacted their business\r\nand departed; the _Defterdars_ did likewise, and went to the door of\r\nthe treasury to give audience. The ordinary viziers, left behind in the\r\npresence of the sultan, usually said nothing unless asked; the grand\r\nvizier alone reported on the decisions of the day.[631] These the sultan\r\nusually approved as made, sometimes mitigating a decision or himself\r\ndictating a reply to an ambassador.[632] Suleiman was willing to give\r\na free hand to Ibrahim, Rustem, and Mohammed Sokolli during their long\r\nperiods of service.[633]\r\n\r\nIn time of war the Divan was held in the grand vizier’s tent, which was\r\nusually pitched near the sultan’s. As all the high officials, and the\r\nheads of bureaus with at least part of their clerks, were present with\r\nthe army, much the same ceremony could be gone through with as in the\r\ncapital. When the sultan was absent from the city on campaigns, the few\r\nofficials of government who were left behind held a secondary Divan on\r\nSaturdays and Sundays. In case of emergency during war-time, or for some\r\nother special reason, a Divan might be held on horseback.[634]\r\n\r\nThe Divan of Suleiman was a splendid ceremony, and it transacted a great\r\namount of administrative and judicial business. A large proportion of\r\nthe duties of the principal officials was attended to in its sessions\r\nrather than in private offices; and on particular matters there was a\r\ncertain amount of deliberation, though the Ottomans were not a people of\r\nmany words. The Divan was by no means a legislative chamber. It was in a\r\nsense a combination of a president’s cabinet and a supreme court;[635]\r\nyet it was unlike both. Its presiding officer was appointed; all its\r\ndecisions required the approval of the sultan, who was not present at\r\nits sessions; and all its members were responsible to him for good\r\nbehavior on penalty of their lives. It was the highest court in the\r\nland, yet not so much a court of appeal as a court of first instance. It\r\nhad no power to judge the validity of laws; yet it was not restricted\r\nin its jurisdiction, since it had cognizance of all civil and criminal\r\ncases that might be presented to it from any part of the empire. In\r\nits judicial aspect, again, its decisions had no validity without the\r\napproval of the sultan. With all its limitations, however, it was of\r\ngreat value to the Ottoman government. Below the sultan, but above all\r\ninstitutions of the empire, it bound together at the top the Ruling\r\nInstitution and the Moslem Institution, and it united similarly all the\r\ncomponent divisions of each; it was the pivot from which were suspended\r\nall the separate parts of the despotically constructed government.\r\nIn it met the ablest men of the empire, chosen by selection after\r\nselection, each one charged with great responsibilities and possessing\r\npower to execute without delay what might be agreed upon. The Divan was\r\nexcellently adapted to the general Ottoman system. It enabled the ruler,\r\nwith a minimum of care, to keep the closest control over every part of\r\nthe empire through extremely intelligent and capable agents, who were\r\nbound to him by gratitude, self-interest, ambition, and fear. It was\r\na training-school of judges, administrators, and statesmen, since men\r\nordinarily rose from place to place among its offices as they gained\r\nexperience; here they imparted ideas and methods to each other, and\r\nmade their abilities known to the highest officials, the grand vizier\r\nand the sultan, with whom lay the power of promotion. Nor was the Divan\r\nwholly destitute of legislative influence. All _Kanuns_ were issued in\r\nthe sultan’s name and after his definite approval; yet the information\r\non which they were based must regularly have come through members\r\nof the Divan, and members of the Divan with their subordinates must\r\ncertainly have drawn them up and revised them into shape. Controlling\r\nadministration and justice and influencing legislation, the Divan, under\r\nthe leadership of the grand vizier, governed the Ottoman Empire for the\r\nsultan.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RULING INSTITUTION AS A WHOLE\r\n\r\nThat which for want of a better name has been called in this treatise\r\nthe Ottoman Ruling Institution has now been discussed in all its general\r\naspects. Space has been lacking for the presentation of many details,\r\nthough the attempt has been made to introduce all such as would give\r\nnecessary evidence or useful illustration. A few statements intended\r\nto summarize and bind together what has been said will complete the\r\ndiscussion of the institution.\r\n\r\nThe Ottoman Ruling Institution was in its most essential aspect a\r\ngovernment for the Ottoman Empire. In this respect its form was a\r\ndespotism, centered in one man, the sultan. Yet the despotism was greatly\r\ncircumscribed by a rigid constitutional law, which was firmly grounded\r\nin strong religious belief and intense national conservatism. This law\r\nheld the sultan within limited functions, but at the same time it gave\r\nhim his right to rule. As a government under this law, the Ottoman Ruling\r\nInstitution maintained public order, defended the empire against its\r\nenemies, and endeavored by conquest to enlarge its possessions and with\r\nthem the domain of the Sacred Law. A large proportion of its energies\r\nwas devoted to obtaining and distributing the means of its own support,\r\nto keeping its own machinery in order, and to maintaining its authority\r\nwithin the empire. The idea of labor for the public welfare or of\r\neffort toward progress was not present. Change came, not by conscious\r\nstriving toward betterment, but by growth, development, and decay, the\r\neffects of which were adjusted when it became necessary. But within such\r\nlimits, there was in the sixteenth century a distinct desire, founded on\r\nconsciousness of greatness, pride of power, and loyalty to Islam, to have\r\nthe government well-ordered and intelligently directed, and to cause it\r\nto bear upon its subjects as evenly and lightly as possible. Suleiman\r\nlaid hold of many problems which had arisen, and through the agency of\r\nhis ablest servants strove to set his house in order. That he did not\r\nsucceed in accomplishing more permanent results was due to the fact that\r\nthe task was too great for any man. The institution was too artificial to\r\nendure indefinitely.\r\n\r\nThe whole institution kept itself in power, and defended and enlarged the\r\nempire, by being organized as an army. With exceptions, all its officers\r\nof government were soldiers and all its army officers had governmental\r\nduties. It constituted a standing army of cavalry and infantry, aided\r\nby artillery, commissary, and transport services; and it controlled a\r\nmuch larger feudal and irregular army. Through the feudal army it kept\r\nthe country in subjection. By garrisons it held the towns quiet. In case\r\nof rebellion, it threw a great force upon the insurgents, and beat them\r\ndown with cruel and resistless energy. For foreign wars it gathered\r\nan enormous but well-controlled host, which was victorious in battle\r\nthroughout the reign of Suleiman. It took by siege Belgrade and Rhodes,\r\nbut it failed at Vienna and Malta. The weakness of the Ruling Institution\r\nas an army was its essential indivisibility. Only one great war could be\r\nwaged at a time, although there were great enemies in two directions;\r\nhence an overwhelming defeat of the principal army would have been\r\nirreparably disastrous. But the army was to suffice for a long period;\r\nand for generations its worst foes were to be, not foreign armies, but\r\ninternal rivalries and departures from its constitutive principles.\r\n\r\nTo maintain the pomp and ceremony which are attached to the idea of an\r\nempire, especially in the East, and to supply the sultan on a large\r\nscale with all the enjoyments which were considered due to his state,\r\nthe Ottoman Ruling Institution was in another aspect a great court\r\nand household. Nearly all its members shared in the display of grand\r\noccasions, many went to the hunt with the sultan, and a large proportion\r\nof them had constant duties of ceremonial and personal service. Suleiman\r\nwas known as the Legislator and the Conqueror, but beyond both these\r\ntitles as the Magnificent; he shone as head of the government and the\r\narmy, but still more as head of the court. Splendor and luxury, however,\r\nare expensive, and in the end his example was to be ruinous.\r\n\r\nAll the members of the Ruling Institution were set off as a nobility by\r\nexemption from taxation and by special jurisdiction; but, lest they might\r\nprove a danger to the institution, they were not allowed to transmit\r\ntheir nobility to their descendants. In the end, however, their special\r\nprivilege was to become so desirable that the walls of separation would\r\nbe invaded and the institution would be wrecked.\r\n\r\nThe Ottoman Ruling Institution, at once the government, the army, and the\r\nnobility of a great nation, was at the same time a genuine slave-family.\r\nAlmost all its members were recruited as slaves and remained slaves\r\nthroughout their days; their lives and their property were at the\r\ndisposal of the sultan; they must obey without hesitation, as all slaves\r\nmust obey. Yet their condition was far from being miserable. Their\r\nslavery conveyed no taint: one of them might be married to a protégée\r\nor even a daughter of the great master; their children would never be\r\nreproached because of the father’s status. It was an honor to be the\r\nsultan’s _kul_. Vast wealth and almost royal power and rule might be\r\ntheirs; yet each member of the Ruling Institution was actually a slave.\r\n\r\nThe most characteristic feature of this institution lay in the fact\r\nthat its recruits were almost all drawn from children (born within or\r\nwithout the empire) of Christian parents, and that before they were\r\nadvanced they were expected to become Mohammedans. A twofold motive lay\r\nbeneath this policy,—a desire to obtain single-hearted servants and to\r\nincrease the number of believers in the Mohammedan faith. Sons of these\r\nconverts were sometimes admitted to the Ruling Institution, but their\r\ngrandsons practically never. Thus a constant stream of the ablest and\r\nfittest Christian children who were born in or near the Ottoman dominions\r\nwere brought into the Ruling Institution, the Ottoman nation, and the\r\nMohammedan fold.\r\n\r\nThe next most characteristic and the most abiding feature of the Ottoman\r\nRuling Institution was its educational quality. The Christian slaves were\r\nall acquired while young, and were trained with the greatest care to\r\nbecome useful members of the institution, each in the capacity for which\r\nnature had best fitted him. They were provided with an education which,\r\nif not so general or so advanced as the usual training of modern times,\r\nwas more nearly complete. Body and mind, social, moral, and religious\r\nnature, all received attention. The immediate object of this education\r\nwas to fit the boys for the sultan’s service in war and government; but\r\nthey were also trained to adorn his ceremonies and his court, and to live\r\nby the principles and in the faith of Mohammed. When they were first\r\nadmitted, their training was more or less like that in schools of an\r\nindustrial, military, and cultural character; but it did not stop with\r\nthe attainment of majority. Army, household, bureaus, local government,\r\nand Divan, all were conducted much like schools. Strict discipline was\r\nconstantly maintained, slackness was severely punished, and industry and\r\nability were richly rewarded. The results were well-nigh incredible;\r\nthey constitute a wonderful demonstration of how little the human\r\nspirit is limited by the ignorance or the restricted and humble life of\r\nancestors. With hardly an exception, the men who guided Suleiman’s empire\r\nto a height of unexampled glory were sons of peasants and herdsmen, of\r\ndowntrodden and miserable subjects, of unlettered and half-civilized men\r\nand women. It is not easy to decide which is more to be admired, the\r\nability by which such young men rose, or the confidence with which they\r\nwere chosen and expected to rise. If these men had not really risen, if\r\nthey had remained boorish, ignorant, and narrow, though elevated to high\r\nposition and authority, the facts would be less remarkable than they are.\r\nThe evidence is, however, that they really became educated, cultured,\r\nand polished men: to this day their descendants have a manner and charm\r\nthat can rarely be found among Western peoples. It is much easier to\r\nunderstand the whole process and its results in a modern democratic\r\nage and land than it was in feudal Europe of the sixteenth century.\r\nThe Ottoman Ruling Institution was from start to finish ingeniously\r\ncontrived to develop its members, within the limits of its purposes, to\r\ntheir utmost capacity. Great authority, great position, great financial\r\nrewards, were offered. Great punishments were not far away from those who\r\nmight prove dangerous, treacherous, or even incompatible and inefficient.\r\n\r\nAs a result of its careful selection and training of men for society,\r\nwar, and government, the Ottoman Ruling Institution, allowing for all\r\nimperfections of structure, was a very efficient and permanent entity.\r\nIt was later to endure terrible shocks and losses without destruction;\r\nit was to suffer a partial separation of its component institutions\r\ninto hostile bodies, and to witness serious departures from its rules\r\nand principles. But, despite attack from without and disintegration and\r\ndecay within, it long stood firm; and, together with its dissimilar\r\ncompanion, the Moslem Institution of the Ottoman Empire, it has kept\r\nthe vital spark of that empire alive for more than two centuries after\r\nextinction began to be thought imminent. Even today its abiding spirit\r\ngives promise of lighting a new and very different torch, which, having\r\nburned away the limitations and imperfections that caused the ruin of the\r\nolder institution, will yet be the brighter for preserving a democratic\r\nfaith in the capacity of the able individual, and a disposition to help\r\nhim forward by education and to trust him with all the responsibility\r\nthat he is able to bear. Most features of the Ottoman Ruling Institution\r\ncannot live in the twentieth century. Despotism, military rule, personal\r\nprivilege, excessive imperial splendor, proselytism, and slavery have\r\nbeen dethroned in favor of political and religious liberty, equality,\r\nfraternity, separation of church and state, and government by the people.\r\nBut the idea of an education which will develop the individual to the\r\nfull extent of his capacities is thoroughly modern; and the disposition\r\nto entrust high offices to those who, without regard to ancestry,\r\nare the ablest, and who become by their own efforts and by carefully\r\nsupervised training the best equipped, is in advance of the ordinary\r\npractice of Western democracies. Herein lies one of the strongest\r\nelements of hope for the future of the new Turkey, which may thus\r\npreserve continuity with the past.\r\n\r\nThe Ottoman Ruling Institution, still thus capable of imparting valuable\r\nideas, was in its halcyon days a thing of immense moment in the world.\r\nOut of carefully selected but most heterogeneous materials it had built\r\nitself up as a firm, strong, and simple structure, which had gathered a\r\nchaotic mass of petty states and hostile peoples into a great and, by\r\ncomparison, a well-governed and durable empire. In the reign of the great\r\nSuleiman no human structure existed which equalled this institution in\r\nwealth, splendor, power, simplicity and rapidity of action, and respect\r\nat home and abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE MOSLEM INSTITUTION OF THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION\r\n\r\nIn a survey of the institutional history of the Ottoman Empire, a study\r\nof the complex organization which was based upon and inspired by the\r\nMohammedan religion would demand as large a space as that given to the\r\nRuling Institution. In a discussion of the government of the empire,\r\nhowever, a much briefer treatment will suffice. The Moslem Institution as\r\na whole will be sketched rapidly; fuller consideration will be given to\r\nits juristic and judicial features, which especially affected and entered\r\ninto the government of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the Moslem Institution of the Ottoman Empire, as of\r\nthe corresponding institutions in all Moslem lands, was and remains to\r\nthe present time wholly different from that of any of the Christian\r\necclesiastical organizations. As a mere church it claimed far less place\r\nand influence than they do, but in other aspects it reached out far more\r\nwidely. It included all those Mohammedans in the Ottoman Empire, outside\r\nof the Ruling Institution, who were in any way lifted above the level\r\nof the ordinary believer. Islam recognized no organized priesthood, no\r\naristocracy, and no monks; yet the Ottoman Moslem Institution possessed\r\ngroups that were much like each of the three. In addition it had a graded\r\neducational system, with a graded corps of teachers, it contained a\r\nhierarchy of jurist-theologians, and it supplied a classified body of\r\njudges, whose combined jurisdictions covered the whole empire. That which\r\nall persons who constituted this institution had in common was a special\r\nrelationship to the Mohammedan religion, sometimes based on birth or\r\npiety, but usually established by intellectual training in connection\r\nwith the Book and the Law of Islam. In contrast with the Ottoman Ruling\r\nInstitution, the Moslem Institution cannot as a whole be regarded under\r\nseveral aspects. Like the former, it included component institutions;\r\nbut these all grew up from the Mohammedan population and rested on\r\none broad base, instead of being extended downward from the top. At\r\nthe same time, the sultan was the head of this institution, whether\r\nit be considered as a whole or in reference to each of its component\r\ninstitutions. He and his government appointed its most influential\r\npersonages, maintained careful oversight of its financial support, and\r\nkept record of the appointments of all its members who shared in this\r\nsupport. The two great institutions of the Ottoman Empire were therefore\r\njoined together at the top, and, as will appear, they touched at every\r\nother level both in financial and in governmental relations.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental difference of the two institutions lay in the fact that\r\nthe members of the Ruling Institution were drawn almost exclusively\r\nfrom Christian families, and the members of the Moslem Institution even\r\nmore exclusively from Mohammedan families. While it is likely that the\r\nmajority of the Mohammedan families had sprung from Christian ancestors\r\nnot many generations back, it is also true that Islam acts rapidly upon\r\nthe spirit of converts. Accordingly the two institutions were very\r\ndifferently constituted. Between them arose a rivalry of tendency and\r\ninfluence which was to become extremely harmful to the Ottoman state.\r\n\r\nIn this treatise the financial side of the Moslem Institution will be\r\nconsidered, the four great groups of its membership will be discussed in\r\nthe proportion of their relation to the government, and some attention\r\nwill be given to the institution as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINANCIAL SUPPORT OF THE MOSLEM INSTITUTION[636]\r\n\r\nAs already stated, a large proportion of the land of the Ottoman Empire,\r\nperhaps one-third,[637] was set aside as _vakf_, or religious endowment.\r\nMuch of this had been so devoted by sultans, and in such cases the\r\nimperial treasury could use for its own purposes none of the revenue or\r\nincome from these lands. Other parcels of land had been set apart by\r\nprivate individuals, in these instances the treasury receiving for its\r\nown use the same revenues as before the endowment, while the surplus\r\nincome from the land was devoted to the purposes specified by the giver.\r\nEach tract of such land was by the original act of endowment assigned to\r\na particular object, and a _Muteveli_ or administrator and a _Nazir_ or\r\ninspector were appointed to take care of it. In a large proportion of\r\ncases a high official of the government or household, such as the grand\r\nvizier, the _Mufti_, the _Kapu Agha_, or the _Kizlar Agha_, was put in\r\ncharge _ex officio_ in one or the other capacity, on the theory that,\r\nbeing near the person of the sultan, he would be subject to constant\r\ncontrol. In course of time the _Kizlar Agha_, the grand vizier, and\r\nthe _Mufti_ found it necessary to organize the properties under their\r\ncharge by holding private Divans of the subordinate administrators and\r\ninspectors, and by appointing _Mufettishes_, or special judges, each with\r\na staff of subordinates and travelling inspectors.[638]\r\n\r\nAlthough every tract of land was assigned for a definite object and\r\nplaced under specified guardians, the _vakfs_ were a matter of public\r\nrecord, and the accounts of all were kept by the treasury department in\r\nthe appropriate bureaus. The subjects who lived on _vakf_ lands seem to\r\nhave been better treated than those on lands of other sorts, just as in\r\nthe West in the Middle Ages the serfs of the church were often better off\r\nthan other serfs.[639] There were three classes of _vakfs_,—the regular\r\n_vakfs_ of the mosques, the _vakfs_ for charitable purposes, and the\r\ncustomary _vakfs_ of the mosques. The last were chiefly in the nature of\r\ninvestments of the funds of the mosques, and were according to _Kanun_\r\nrather than _Sheri_.[640] In the second class were included endowments of\r\nschools, libraries, hospitals, bridges, fountains, caravanserais, public\r\nbaths, convents for dervishes, and the like. The narrow provision of the\r\nRuling Institution for public service was in this way supplemented.[641]\r\nThe first class deserves further attention.\r\n\r\nThe chief material unit in connection with the Moslem Institution was the\r\nmosque. Each great mosque was a large house of worship, with a group of\r\nsmaller institutions clustered about it, such as colleges, law schools,\r\nhospitals, insane asylums, and soup-kitchens. For the support of these\r\nand of all persons who conducted them, the income from the _vakfs_ of\r\nthe mosque was applied. In many cases the lands which had belonged to\r\nChristian churches before the Ottoman conquest were assigned as _vakfs_\r\nfor the support of the mosques into which the churches were converted.\r\nFor example, the grounds of the sultan’s principal palace had belonged\r\nto the church, and were assigned as _vakf_ to the mosque of Aya Sofia.\r\nWhen Mohammed II took them for his palace he pledged a revenue of one\r\nthousand and one aspers a day to the great mosque.[642] This church was\r\none of eight in the city of Constantinople which were so treated.[643]\r\nThe revenue of Aya Sofia was estimated at two hundred thousand ducats a\r\nyear.[644] The income of the principal mosques being much larger than\r\nthe expenses, a considerable portion of the surplus was used by the\r\nguardians for their own benefit, although they were supposed to receive\r\nno compensation, but to labor for the love of God. The fact is that\r\nmany of the sultan’s _kullar_ provided an inheritance for their sons\r\nand descendants by setting apart for specific purposes lands in _vakf_,\r\nof which the desired persons should be administrators, it being clearly\r\nunderstood that a portion of the income should be retained by them.[645]\r\nThe remainder of the surplus was held in a special treasury by the\r\nappropriate bureaus, or was reinvested in customary _vakfs_, or was lent\r\nto the government. The _vakfs_ as a whole supported all the official\r\nmembers of the Moslem Institution, except that the judges derived much\r\nof their income from fees and fines.[646] The treasury department\r\nreceived and controlled all the revenues from _vakfs_, and paid from the\r\nappropriate funds all who were duly certified as recipients of salaries\r\nand pensions.\r\n\r\nAll the _Ulema_, in connection with their support from semi-public funds,\r\npossessed the noble privilege of immunity from taxation. Since the\r\nrendering of justice was in their hands, they had their own justice. In\r\naddition, their property was not subject to confiscation; and, since they\r\nwere not _kullar_, it passed by inheritance to their relatives and never\r\nto the sultan. All these privileges gave the learned class in the Ottoman\r\nEmpire the prestige of nobility, besides great financial advantage.[647]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM\r\n\r\nLike the Ruling Institution, the Moslem Institution contained and\r\nembodied an educational system which was of its essential structure.\r\nThrough it, from the time of Mohammed II, the great majority of the\r\nmembers of the institution, including all who expected promotion,\r\nwere required to pass; accordingly, they bore as a body the name of\r\nthe _Ulema_, or learned men.[648] The schools, supported by _vakfs_\r\nand attached to mosques, were in three grades: the _mektebs_ or\r\nprimary schools, known in the sixteenth century as _okumak-yerleri_ or\r\nreading-places; the ordinary _medressehs_ or colleges; and the higher\r\n_medressehs_ or law schools, of university grade. The _mektebs_ taught\r\nArabic reading and writing and the Koran; the _medressehs_ gave a course\r\nof ten studies resembling the Seven Arts of the West;[649] the law\r\nschools taught the group of sciences connected with the Koran and the\r\n_Sheri_ and including both law and theology.[650]\r\n\r\nThere was no compulsory education; nor could the system, by reason of\r\nthe individual character of its foundations, be universal for Mohammedan\r\nchildren. But it may be supposed that any Moslem parent, the inhabitant\r\nof a town of some size, who desired his son to learn the rather difficult\r\nart of reading and writing Turkish and Arabic, or even to enter upon a\r\nlearned career, was not devoid of an opportunity. Furthermore, where\r\nprimary schools existed the instruction was free, and some students were\r\neven fed and lodged;[651] the students in the _medressehs_ were also\r\npartially supported, and those in the law schools received a sufficiency.\r\nThis system, which dated back at least to the twelfth century in Moslem\r\nlands, probably in the Ottoman Empire in the sixteenth century gave\r\nbetter opportunity for education to Moslem boys than was afforded to\r\nChristian children in any land until a much later date. The Ottomans\r\nbelieved thoroughly in education; but, unfortunately, their conservatism\r\nwas in course of time to turn a beneficent institution into a harmful\r\none. No change of consequence, either in methods of teaching or in\r\nsubjects of study, was permitted from century to century; hence the\r\ntraining that had once carried its earnest pupils to the forefront of\r\nhuman knowledge was in time to hold them firmly at a stage which the rest\r\nof the world had long passed through and left far behind.\r\n\r\nThe _medressehs_ were very numerous in the empire;[652] the mosque of\r\nthe Conqueror had eight, that of Suleiman five. It was Suleiman who\r\nset the gradations of the system in their final form. All who aspired\r\nto any official position in the Moslem Institution must pass through a\r\n_medresseh_ of some degree. On first entering they were called _Softas_,\r\nor more properly _Sukhtas_, as those who were _inflamed_ with the\r\ndesire for learning. The students were in different grades, but there\r\nseems to have been no fixed number of years of study; the instruction\r\nbeing largely individual, each could proceed as rapidly as he was\r\nable. On finishing, they received a sort of master’s degree and were\r\ncalled _Danishmend_, which appears in several of the early sources as\r\n_Talisman_.[653] Such students as were content to teach primary schools,\r\nor to attend to ecclesiastical duties, needed to study no longer.\r\n\r\nThose who aspired to become jurists or judges had to pursue a long course\r\nin law in the higher _medressehs_. At the end of this time they were\r\nexamined personally by the _Mufti_, or chief jurist, and if successful\r\nthey were dignified with the title of _Mulâzim_, or candidate. Those who\r\ndid not aspire to the higher judicial positions ended their preparation\r\nat this point. The more ambitious sought appointment, for which they were\r\nnow qualified, as _Muderisler_, or professors, in _medressehs_ of low\r\ngrade. The _Muderisler_ received large salaries, which increased as they\r\nrose. They were in three classes,—the _Muderisler_ of Constantinople,\r\nof Adrianople and Brusa, and of the other cities of the empire. The\r\n_Muderisler_ of Constantinople numbered about four hundred; they were in\r\nten grades, distinguished according to the subjects which they taught.\r\nThose of other cities than the capital, and those at the capital who\r\ndid not pass through all the grades, became either jurists or judges\r\nof lesser degrees. Those who wished to reach the higher judgeships\r\nwere obliged to pass through all ten grades. Since this was so long a\r\nprocess as regularly to bring a man to gray hairs before he reached the\r\ntop, the rigid grading early began to be circumvented by the practice\r\nof inscribing the sons of _Ulema_ as _Muderisler_ while they were very\r\nyoung, substitutes being hired to teach in their places.[654] By the age\r\nof thirty or forty they would thus be able to attain high position. A\r\ncontinuance of this process, combined with the immunities and privileges\r\nof the _Ulema_, was in time to lead to great accumulations of wealth in\r\nthe hands of a few families, who would be able to keep most of the high\r\njudicial offices within their own numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLERGY, SEIDS, AND DERVISHES\r\n\r\nThe clergy of the Ottoman nation were, as has been shown, of no great\r\neducation, and they seem to have possessed less influence than the\r\npriests of any other religion.[655] They were in five classes: the\r\n_Sheiks_, or preachers; the _Khatibs_, or leaders of Friday services; the\r\n_Imâms_, or leaders of daily services; the _Muezzins_, who intoned the\r\ncall to prayer; and the _Kaims_, or caretakers of the mosques.\r\n\r\nThe _Seids_, also known as _Emirs_ or _Sherifs_, were a class apart\r\namong the Ottomans. They were not properly members of the _Ulema_,\r\nunless, like others, they passed through the schools; they owed their\r\ndistinction rather to a real or assumed genealogy which carried their\r\nancestry back to the Prophet Mohammed. They alone were privileged to\r\nwear a green turban. They were numerous; but the claims of many were\r\ndoubted, and some of them seem to have possessed reputations that were\r\nfar from savory.[656] They constituted the only hereditary nobility among\r\nthe Ottomans, but their privileges appear to have been personal rather\r\nthan financial: they were not to be struck, for example, on penalty\r\nof severe punishment, and they had their own justice. Great honor was\r\nshown to two members of this nobility, descendants of the Prophet:\r\nto the _Mir-Alem_, the sultan’s standard-bearer, who was regularly a\r\n_Seid_, and had precedence of all the officers of the army; and to the\r\n_Nakib ol-Eshraf_, head of the _Seids_, who ranked second in the Moslem\r\nInstitution, and at the ceremonies of Bairam had precedence even of the\r\n_Mufti_. The _Nakib ol-Eshraf_ was appointed by the sultan for life;\r\nthat member of the _Ulema_ who was a _Seid_ and who ranked highest when\r\nthe place fell vacant was ordinarily chosen. He had a staff of officers\r\nand clerks in the capital and the provinces, and was head of the separate\r\njurisdiction of the _Seids_. Under the sultan he held despotic authority\r\nover all _Seids_; and, when the sovereign ordered the punishment or death\r\nof one of them, the _Nakib ol-Eshraf_ was commissioned to carry out the\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nDervishes also were not members of the _Ulema_. They were of many orders,\r\nthough sixteenth-century observers seem to have been impressed with but\r\nfour.[657] They represented in Islam the monks, the hermits, and the\r\nbegging friars of Christianity. Through them heresies spread, uprisings\r\nwere concocted, mobs were gathered, and holy war was preached. On more\r\nthan one occasion they endangered the power of the government.[658] Many\r\nwere honest, God-fearing folk, while others were scarcely more than\r\ntramps and wandering thieves.\r\n\r\nClergy, _Seids_, and dervishes represented the merely religious side\r\nof the Moslem Institution. Islam was fundamentally a religion without\r\npriests, monks, or nobles; and these persons never grew to possess\r\npermanent influence and power in the Ottoman state.[659]\r\n\r\n\r\nJURISTS AND THE MUFTI\r\n\r\nA number of the _Ulema_ who had finished the law course, and who at some\r\nprevious time had chosen to become counsellors and jurists rather than\r\nto take up the severer and more active judicial career, constituted a\r\ndistinct body, the _muftis_, who were held in high esteem. One of these\r\nwas assigned as associate to the judge of every important city, to the\r\nnumber of about two hundred in all, while others were counsellors for\r\nthe _Beylerbeys_ and _Sanjak Beys_. Appointed for life, they lived in\r\nretirement, having no initiative of action. When the judge, _Bey_, or any\r\nprivate citizen, confronted by a case or other matter which involved a\r\nlearned knowledge of the Sacred Law, submitted to one of them a question\r\nin writing, usually in the form of a hypothetical case, it was the duty\r\nof the _mufti_, after careful consideration of the question in the light\r\nof the law books of the school of Abu Hanifa, to give an answer that\r\napplied the Sacred Law to the matter concerned. These answers, which\r\nwere called _fetvas_, were usually extremely concise and unaccompanied\r\nby reasoning; they were prepared and sealed in solemn form.[660] When a\r\njudge or a _Bey_ proposed to his _mufti_ a question touching a pending\r\nlaw case, the _mufti’s_ response ordinarily settled the case. Private\r\ncitizens who obtained _fetvas_ ordinarily did so to help their causes\r\nin pending law suits; here again a pertinent question and answer would\r\nusually settle the case. Since there was no class of professional\r\nlawyers, the _muftis_ were a necessary and very useful body.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary cities the _mufti_ ranked after the judge. This was not the\r\ncase in Constantinople, where the sultan and his officers of government\r\nfrequently had questions to present which touched matters of the highest\r\npublic importance. As a consequence the _mufti_ of Constantinople became\r\n_par excellence_ the _Mufti_. Mohammed II assigned to him also the title\r\nof _Sheik ul-Islam_, the Ancient of Islam, which in later times was to\r\nbecome his ordinary title. The _Mufti_ was not regularly chosen from\r\namong his fellows, but was usually advanced by the sultan from the active\r\njudicial service.[661] He had the right to appoint and promote all the\r\nother _muftis_ of the empire. A special bureau called the _Fetva-khaneh_\r\nwas created by Suleiman to assist the _Mufti_ in preparing decisions.\r\n\r\nThe _Mufti_ was definitely constituted by Suleiman the head of the\r\n_Ulema_;[662] and as such he outranked all officials of government,\r\nexcept that he yielded place to the grand vizier on ordinary occasions.\r\nHe was almost the equal of the sultan himself, since he was the expounder\r\nand representative of the Sacred Law, which was above the sultan.\r\nBayezid II was accustomed to stand to receive the _Mufti_, and to give\r\nhim a seat above his own.[663] Early in Suleiman’s reign it was said,\r\n“The Turk shows his [_Mufti_] the greatest reverence of any man in\r\nhis realm, because he represents justice and the image of God.”[664]\r\nSixteenth-century Westerners compared the _Mufti_ with a “very great\r\ncardinal,”[665] but more often with the pope.[666] The _Mufti_ had,\r\nhowever, no temporal authority and no active part in affairs; like\r\nhis brethren in lesser cities, he could give responses only when his\r\nopinion was asked. He could, however, rightly be compared with the pope\r\nin dignity and in the magnitude of the matters with which he dealt. His\r\nalone was the right to proclaim that war should be begun, and to send\r\nout preachers to declare that the war was holy and incumbent on all\r\nMoslems. He was frequently consulted by the sultan as to the conformity\r\nof proposed _Kanuns_ with the Sacred Law.[667] In his hands rested the\r\nextreme responsibility of pronouncing that a sultan had transgressed\r\nthe Sacred Law and ought to be deposed. In short, though he could claim\r\nno divinely delegated power to create new rules of faith or law, he was\r\nthe final earthly authority in the interpretation of the Sacred Law as\r\ncompleted by Mohammed the Prophet. He exercised a function similar to\r\nwhat in the United States of America is the highest office of the Supreme\r\nCourt,—the power of defending the Constitution. In this capacity the\r\n_Mufti_ often withstood the sultan. _Urf_ was subordinate to _Sheri_,\r\nand in case of conflict the former must yield; therefore the sultan, who\r\nembodied the former, could not override the _Mufti_, who represented the\r\nlatter. A century after the time of Suleiman it was said:—\r\n\r\n“The _Mufti_ is the principal head of the _Mahometan_ Religion or Oracle\r\nof all doubtful questions in the Law, and is a person of great esteem\r\nand reverence amongst the _Turks_; his Election is solely in the Grand\r\nSignior, who chuses a man to that Office always famous for his Learning\r\nin the Law, and eminent for his vertues and strictness of Life: his\r\nAuthority is so great amongst them, that when he passes Judgment or\r\nDetermination in any point, the Grand Signior himself will in no wise\r\ncontradict or oppose it....\r\n\r\n“In matters of State the _Sultan_ demands his opinion, whether it be in\r\nCondemnation of any great man to Death, or in making War or Peace, or\r\nother important Affairs of the Empire; either to appear the more just\r\nand religious, or to incline the People more willingly to Obedience. And\r\nthis practice is used in business of greatest moment; scarce a Visier\r\nis proscribed, or a _Pashaw_ for pretence of crime displaced, or any\r\nmatter of great alteration or change designed, but the Grand Signior arms\r\nhimself with the _Mufti’s_ Sentence; for the nature of man reposes more\r\nsecurity in innocence and actions of Justice, than in the absolute and\r\nuncontroulable power of the Sword. And the Grand Signior, tho he himself\r\nis above the Law, and is the Oracle and Fountain of Justice, yet it is\r\nseldom that he proceeds so irregularly to contemn that Authority wherein\r\ntheir Religion hath placed an ultimate power of Decision in all their\r\nControversies.”[668]\r\n\r\nThe power of the _Mufti_ in the sixteenth century may be illustrated by\r\none or two instances. In the early years of the century, shortly before\r\nthe appearance of the Reformation movement in Western Europe, the Ottoman\r\nEmpire was threatened by the presence of large numbers of heretics in\r\nAsia Minor, simultaneously with the rise of a strong Mohammedan heretical\r\npower in Persia. Selim the Grim disposed of the heretics in his dominions\r\nby wholesale execution,[669] and punished, though he failed to crush,\r\nthe Persians by the defeat of Khaldiran and the annexation of a large\r\npart of their territory. After he had got rid of Mohammedan heresy in his\r\ndominions, he was impressed with the absence of unity occasioned by the\r\npresence of the Christian subjects.[670] Accordingly he decided to order\r\nall these Christians to accept Islam on pain of death. To say that he\r\ndesired to execute the Christians of his dominions would be to put the\r\nemphasis in the wrong place. He seems rather to have had in mind such a\r\nprocess as was carried through in Spain in the course of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, as a result of which none were left in that land who professed\r\nanother than the dominant religion.\r\n\r\nBut here the _Mufti_ Jemali intervened decisively. He had readily given\r\na _fetva_ authorizing the extermination of the heretics as in accordance\r\nwith the Sacred Law, and he was later to sanction the Persian and the\r\nEgyptian wars. In this case, Selim, it is said, deceived him by a\r\nhypothetical question into giving a response which might be interpreted\r\nto authorize the forcible conversion of the Christians. After the order\r\nwas issued, however, Jemali, awakened to the situation, put the Greek\r\nPatriarch in possession of a sufficient defence by showing him that the\r\nSacred Law provided that Christians who had accepted Mohammedan rule and\r\nagreed to pay _kharâj_ and _jizyeh_ (land tribute and poll-tax) were,\r\naside from certain regulations, to be left unmolested in the exercise\r\nof their religion. This provision the Patriarch, as instructed by the\r\n_Mufti_, claimed to be an irrevocable and eternal compact; therefore,\r\nhe urged, since Selim’s intention was contrary to it, his purpose\r\nwas unlawful and must be abandoned. The argument prevailed, and the\r\nChristians were not disturbed as to their faith.\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked that Selim’s idea was an excellent one from the\r\npoint of view of statesmanship, and would, in the end, have resulted\r\nin a great advantage to the Moslem Institution. As pointed out in the\r\nfirst chapter, the Christian churches in the Ottoman Empire constituted\r\na group of organizations that were parallel and rival to the Moslem\r\nInstitution; hence their removal would have left it a free field. Whether\r\nits unopposed action would, in the long run, have been an advantage to\r\nthe empire and to the world is a matter for speculation which would be\r\nout of place here; but as a state the Ottoman Empire would have been\r\nnotably unified by the clearing away of these institutions. They were\r\nold, strong, and of a tenacious vitality; in them centered the hopes and\r\naspirations of the subject Christians; while they persisted, complete\r\namalgamation of the population was impossible; they were to keep alive a\r\nsentiment of nationality and separatism that three centuries later was\r\nto break off great sections from the empire. It seems clear, then, that,\r\nhad Selim been able to carry out his purpose, the history of the Levant\r\nsince his time would have been very different from what it has been. But\r\nthe _Mufti_, as guardian of the Sacred Law, was right. The position of\r\nthe Christian subjects rested on a firm constitutional foundation.[671]\r\nThe Prophet Mohammed himself, nine centuries before Selim, had made the\r\nreligious and social unity of the Ottoman Empire forever impossible.\r\nHe had also made political unity impossible at that time; for in the\r\nsixteenth century political, apart from religious, unity was not\r\nunderstood in either the East or the West. Only in the twentieth century\r\nwas Turkey to arrive at a new hope of political unity through an attempt\r\nto remove religious differences from a position of great influence upon\r\nthe state.\r\n\r\nAnother instance of the _Mufti’s_ power occurred in the reign of\r\nSuleiman, who, as a willing servant of the Sacred Law, freely recognized\r\nthe greatness of the _Mufti’s_ position. The _Mufti_ Ebu su’ud was one\r\nof the most distinguished ornaments of the Legislator’s reign. He had\r\npassed through all the stages of advancement among the _Ulema_, and had\r\nbeen _Kaziasker_ eight years when he was constituted _Mufti_. He wrote a\r\ngreat commentary on the Koran, and it was he who collected the best-known\r\n_Kanun-nameh_ of Suleiman.[672] This man was closely connected with\r\none of those sorrowful events which made the reign of Suleiman, great\r\nas it was in victory, splendor, and learning, equally great in tragic\r\nruin of hope. Suleiman must have passed through many hours of torturing\r\nindecision before he determined upon the execution of his eldest son,\r\nMustapha; and in so great a matter he needed to consult the guardian of\r\nthe Sacred Law. The story of the part which the _Mufti_ played shall\r\nbe told by Busbecq, who appears for the last time in the pages of this\r\ntreatise:—\r\n\r\n“Solyman had brought with him [to Amasia, where he joined the army] his\r\nson’s death doom, which he had prepared before leaving home. With a view\r\nto satisfying religious scruples, he had previously consulted his mufti.\r\nThis is the name given to the chief priest among the Turks, and answers\r\nto our Pope of Rome. In order to get an impartial answer from the mufti,\r\nhe put the case before him as follows:—He told him that there was at\r\nConstantinople a merchant of good position, who, when about to leave home\r\nfor some time, placed over his property and household a slave to whom he\r\nhad shown the greatest favour, and entrusted his wife and children to his\r\nloyalty. No sooner was the master gone than this slave began to embezzle\r\nhis master’s property, and plot against the lives of his wife and\r\nchildren; nay, more, had attempted to compass his master’s destruction.\r\nThe question which he (Solyman) wished the mufti to answer was this:\r\nWhat sentence could be lawfully pronounced against this slave? The mufti\r\nanswered that in his judgment he deserved to be tortured to death. Now,\r\nwhether this was the mufti’s own opinion, or whether it was pronounced at\r\nthe instigation of Roostem or Roxolana, there is no doubt that it greatly\r\ninfluenced Solyman, who was already minded to order the execution of his\r\nson; for he considered that the latter’s offence against himself was\r\nquite as great as that of the slave against his master, in the case he\r\nhad put before the mufti.”[673]\r\n\r\nThe _Mufti’s_ power in reality went beyond the field of interpretation\r\nand entered upon that of legislation. It is well known how much the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States of America has extended the powers of\r\nthe federal government by the interpretation of the Constitution. The\r\n_Mufti_ acted similarly, though with less freedom, in interpreting the\r\nSacred Law. His power in this direction was recognized by some Ottoman\r\nMohammedans: “The _Mufti_ hath a spacious Field for his Interpretation;\r\nfor it is agreed that their Law is temporary, and admits of Expositions\r\naccording to times and state of things. And though they Preach to the\r\nPeople the perfection of their _Alchoran_; yet the wiser men hold, that\r\nthe _Mufti_ hath an expository power of the Law to improve and better it,\r\naccording to the state of things, times and conveniencies of the Empire;\r\nfor that their Law was never designed to be a clog or confinement to the\r\npropagation of Faith, but an advancement thereof, and therefore to be\r\ninterpreted in the largest and farthest fetched sense, when the strict\r\nwords will not reach the design intended.”[674]\r\n\r\nThe _fetvas_ of the _muftis_ amounted in practice to a body of\r\nlegislation which was intermediate between the _Sheri_ and the _Kanuns_:\r\nthey partook of the sacred character of the former, as being based\r\ndirectly upon it; they were, like the latter, of a modern and practical\r\nnature derived from recent application to actual cases. In the _fetvas_,\r\nhowever, nothing radical or startling could ever be attempted; novel\r\nfeatures were obliged to be of a most inconspicuous character. The\r\n_fetvas_ as a whole caused some development in the Sacred Law, but their\r\ncombined additions were altogether too slight to keep it abreast of the\r\nmarch of events.\r\n\r\nIn reality, the _muftis_ occupied the most influential position in the\r\nMoslem Institution and perhaps in the Ottoman state. Usually inferior\r\nto judges and officers of government in income and display, and giving\r\nno direct impulse to affairs, they nevertheless wielded the greatest\r\ncontinuous power in the state,—the quiet, steady, almost changeless,\r\nalmost irresistible, force of Mohammedanism. They were “guardians of\r\nthe laws” in as full a sense as any Greek could wish. Their authority\r\nrested, first, on the acceptance by the entire Moslem population of the\r\nabsolute supremacy of the Sacred Law, and, second, on the recognition by\r\nthe same population that they, who had acquired learning in the Law by\r\nlong years of arduous mental labor, and who had chosen to continue in\r\nits study rather than take up its more active and lucrative application\r\nin service on the bench, were the persons through whom its supremacy on\r\nearth was rightly to be maintained. Thus by popular consent the _muftis_\r\nconstituted the conservative, regulative force in the Ottoman state. They\r\nwere destined to contribute very largely to the empire’s durability,\r\nwhich, despite frightful shocks, disasters, and losses, was to continue\r\nfar beyond the expectation of the world.\r\n\r\nThe _muftis_ did their work only too well. The idea of the changelessness\r\nof the Sacred Law was essentially hostile to progress. Although\r\nconsiderable flexibility was possible under its provisions, the\r\nflexibility lay in its application to particular cases, and hardly at all\r\nin the law itself. When the Ottoman power began to rise, scholasticism\r\nwas at its height, both in Christianity and in Mohammedanism. From\r\nthis blighting theological and philosophical bondage, which tended to\r\nextend its deadening sway over all the activities of the human spirit,\r\nChristendom was delivered by the Renaissance and the Reformation. The\r\nOttoman mind, on the contrary, continued to be held under it till the\r\nmost recent years. That it remained so long in bondage, with scarcely a\r\nstruggle to escape, was due very largely to the authority of the _Ulema_.\r\nThey who accomplished much toward building the Ottoman state into a solid\r\nstructure, and toward maintaining it against foes without and within,\r\nalso held it nearly stationary while the rest of the world moved on.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JUDICIAL SYSTEM[675]\r\n\r\nThe judges who belonged to the corps of the _Ulema_ had jurisdictions\r\nthat were based upon territory, and that covered the whole empire to\r\nan even wider extent than did the administration of the government.\r\nThe Crimea and North Africa, though under vassal governments, formed\r\npart of the Ottoman judicial system.[676] The tribunals of the judges\r\nseem to have been competent for all kinds of cases, whether civil or\r\ncriminal, and whether covered by the _Sheri_, the _Kanuns_, _Adet_,\r\nor none of these.[677] But, as has been seen, they were not competent\r\nto try all persons. The _kullar_, the _Seids_, and the members of the\r\nforeign colonies had their separate systems of justice; even the subject\r\nChristians, in matters between themselves, had their own ecclesiastical\r\ntribunals to which they regularly resorted. Cases concerning the\r\nadministration of certain groups of _vakf_ lands were tried in special\r\ncourts, which were, however, presided over by members of the regular\r\njudicial body. The fief-holders had seigniorial jurisdiction in certain\r\nmatters; and the officers of local government seem also to have had\r\nindependent right to decide cases outside the sphere of the Sacred Law,\r\nwhether covered by _Kanun_, _Adet_, or unprovided for.[678] The judges\r\nof the Moslem Institution, therefore, tried all cases involving the\r\nSacred Law which arose within the empire, and which were between Moslem\r\nand Moslem or between Moslem and Christian (except when the Moslem was a\r\n_kul_ of the sultan or a _Seid_), as well as a large proportion of the\r\ncases which were outside the sphere of the Sacred Law.\r\n\r\nNearly all judges were judges of cities, having jurisdiction also over\r\nthe surrounding territory;[679] exceptions were the _Mufettishes_ of\r\nthe _vakf_ lands, the judge who accompanied the _Kapudan Pasha_ on his\r\nannual cruise to the Aegean Islands, the two _Kaziaskers_, and the\r\ngrand vizier. The judges were all carefully graded in five principal\r\nclasses, three of which were each again subdivided into several groups.\r\nBy another grouping, on a geographical basis, they were in two divisions\r\nunder the _Kaziaskers_ of Europe and Asia. The five classes were the\r\ngreater _Mollas_, the lesser _Mollas_, the _Mufettishes_, the _Kazis_,\r\nand the _Naibs_. The general name for judge was _Kazi_, and the popular\r\ntitle of respect for them all was _Molla_;[680] but the official titles\r\nwere as described above. In general, a _Danishmend_ who aspired to the\r\njudicial career chose while in the law course, according to his ambition\r\nor ability, which of the five classes he would strive to enter and after\r\nentering one of them he could not pass to another. Each had its ladder of\r\npromotion.\r\n\r\nThe greater _Mollas_ were in six groups: the _Kaziasker_ of Rumelia;\r\nthe _Kaziasker_ of Anatolia; the judge of Constantinople; the judges of\r\nMecca and Medina; the judges of Adrianople, Brusa, Cairo, and Damascus;\r\nand the judges of the three suburbs of Constantinople,—Galata, Scutari,\r\nand Eyub,—and of Jerusalem, Smyrna, Aleppo, Larissa, and Salonica. These\r\nseventeen were in later times nominated by the _Mufti_ for approval by\r\nthe grand vizier and confirmation by the sultan; in Suleiman’s time\r\nthe members of the last four groups were nominated by the _Kaziaskers_\r\nsubject to the approval of the pashas.[681] Their positions were\r\noriginally held for life, or until promotion, or during good behavior;\r\nand they rose by promotion from group to group. Each had a number of\r\nassistants, clerks, book-keepers, treasurers, and the like. They seem\r\nto have had superior jurisdiction over the inhabitants, and control\r\nof the lesser judges, in the entire dominion of the officer of local\r\ngovernment—_Beylerbey_ or _Sanjak Bey_—who resided in their city.[682]\r\nThe _Kaziaskers_ had each a large corps of subordinate officials. They\r\ncontrolled the appointment of the judges of all other classes, subject\r\nto the confirmation of the sultan. The five _Ulema_ who held high office\r\nnear the person of the sultan—his _Hoja_ or teacher, the head physician,\r\nthe head astrologer, and the two imperial _Imâms_—were reckoned as\r\nadjunct members among the _Mollas_ of the first class. They had no small\r\ninfluence on the destiny of the empire, as being the most disinterested\r\nand trusted persons who had the ear of the monarch.\r\n\r\nThe lesser _Mollas_ were the judges of the ten cities of second\r\nrank,—Marash, Bagdad, Bosna-serai, Sofia, Belgrade, Aintab, Kutaia,\r\nKonia, Philippopolis, and Diarbekr.\r\n\r\nThe _Mufettishes_ were five in number, three representing the _vakfs_ in\r\nConstantinople that were under the _Mufti_, the grand vizier, and the\r\n_Kizlar Agha_, and two representing all three of these exalted officials\r\nin Adrianople and Brusa. Cases concerning _vakfs_ that might arise\r\nelsewhere were taken before the nearest _Kazi_.\r\n\r\nThe _Kazis_ proper included the vast majority of the judges, to the\r\nnumber, in D’Ohsson’s time, of about four hundred and fifty, who were\r\nstationed in smaller cities. About two hundred in Europe, in nine groups,\r\nand those in the Crimea and North Africa, were under the authority of the\r\n_Kaziasker_ of Rumelia. About two hundred and twenty-five in Asia, in ten\r\ngroups, and thirty-six in Egypt, in six groups, were under the control of\r\nthe _Kaziasker_ of Anatolia.[683]\r\n\r\nThe _Naibs_ were in several groups, as judges of villages, lesser judges\r\nof cities, temporary substitutes for higher judges, and the like. They\r\nordinarily had no salaries, but lived upon fees and irregular earnings.\r\nA group of these were important in the sixteenth century as a kind of\r\ninspectors of public morals. They purchased their places, and lived upon\r\nfines—and sometimes, it is said, upon extortions—from persons who did not\r\nwish their private lives exposed.[684]\r\n\r\nExercising many of the functions of police and market judges, but not\r\nbelonging to the _Ulema_, were the _Muhtesibs_, or lieutenants of police,\r\nof the various cities. Accompanied by soldiers and attendants, they\r\npatrolled the streets and inspected the markets, giving special heed to\r\nweights and measures. If they found that the law had been infringed, they\r\ninflicted punishment, whether financial or corporal, on the spot.[685]\r\nBy reason of the duty of applying sumptuary regulations, the office was\r\noften lucrative.[686]\r\n\r\nIn every court a single judge sat, with his clerks and other\r\nsubordinates. Cases were presented by the parties concerned, and\r\ndecisions were usually rendered immediately and in very concise form.\r\nThe judge coöperated with the _Subashi_ of the city, who brought before\r\nthe judge persons that were summoned and who executed the sentences\r\nof the judges,[687] an arrangement in which lay a certain likeness to\r\nthe ecclesiastical courts of the West, which might condemn, but left\r\nthe execution to the secular arm. Appeal went up to judges higher in\r\nthe scale, and finally to the grand vizier.[688] Costs and fines were\r\nmoderate, and were fixed by _Kanun_;[689] they constituted, however,\r\na large part of the income of the judges and their subordinates. The\r\njudges were salaried, and some of them had in addition large amounts of\r\nirregular earnings. The judges attended to all the notarial work of the\r\nempire.\r\n\r\nThe _Subashis_, _Sanjak Beys_, and _Beylerbeys_ had complete jurisdiction\r\nover all members of the Ruling Institution who resided in their\r\ndistricts, as well as a more or less undefined authority in cases\r\ncontrolled by _Kanun_, _Adet_, or otherwise outside the sphere of the\r\nSacred Law.[690] In capital cases they never proceeded to execution\r\nwithout obtaining the approval of the judge of the city, in order to\r\nhave the sanction of the Sacred Law.[691] The decisions of the judges in\r\ncriminal cases were regularly submitted to without a murmur, since it was\r\nfelt that the judges represented Mohammed, “wore the robe of God,” and\r\nhad power of “sovereign sentence.”[692]\r\n\r\nThe highest courts were those of the _Kaziaskers_, the grand vizier, and\r\nthe Divan. The _Kaziaskers_, besides attending to the cases that were\r\nbrought before them in the Divan and at the palace gate after its close,\r\nheld court at all other times in their own houses.[693] Mohammed II had\r\nprovided that, when cases were brought primarily to them in the city of\r\nConstantinople, those which concerned Moslems should come before the\r\n_Kaziasker_ of Rumelia and those which concerned non-Moslems before the\r\n_Kaziasker_ of Anatolia. The titles of these judges show their original\r\nfunctions as judges of the armies of Rumelia and Anatolia, offices\r\nwhich they continued to exercise in time of war. In this capacity,\r\nalso, appeals came up to them in time of peace from the _Subashis_ and\r\n_Sanjak Beys_ in matters touching _kullar_. The power of the _Kaziaskers_\r\nhad been extended to include the headship of all the judges of their\r\nrespective regions, and the appointment of all judges, subject to the\r\napproval of the pashas. In the Divan, and as “Pillars of the State,” they\r\nranked next to the viziers; they had the first right of audience with\r\nthe sultan at the close of each Divan; and until the reign of Suleiman\r\nthey had had all the authority over the _Ulema_ that later came to the\r\n_Mufti_. They had immense incomes and were highly honored and esteemed.\r\n\r\nThe grand vizier was actual head of the Moslem Institution as substitute\r\nfor the sultan; accordingly his court was the highest court of appeal for\r\nall ordinary civil cases. It was also, however, like all other courts\r\nin the empire, a court of first instance. He decided great numbers of\r\ncases, large and small, for rich and poor alike. Justice was refused to\r\nno one; it was rendered either by the grand vizier’s own decision, or by\r\nreference for prompt settlement to one of the _Kaziaskers_ or to some\r\nother judge.[694]\r\n\r\nThe Divan’s principal deliberative business as a court was the trial\r\nof capital cases of great officials. Although many such persons were\r\nexecuted, it is strenuously denied that Suleiman ever ordered death\r\nwithout a trial.[695] Nevertheless, the process was usually held in\r\nthe absence of the accused person and without his knowledge; he might\r\nbe at the end of the empire. In case of conviction a _Chaush_ was sent\r\nto the condemned man’s place of residence, bearing secretly a written\r\ncommission, which was given to the nearest official who had power to\r\nexecute. The condemned man had at best a few hours in which to settle his\r\naffairs and make his peace with God; then he was executed, and his head\r\nwas given to the _Chaush_ to be taken to the sultan as proof that the\r\nmission had been faithfully accomplished. It is said that forty or fifty\r\nheads sometimes reached the court of Suleiman in a single day.[696]\r\n\r\nEarly in his reign, when filled with pride by his victory over the rebel\r\nGhazali, and feeling warm friendship toward Doge Loredano of Venice,\r\nhe wished to send the rebel’s head to the Doge by a special embassy,\r\nand was dissuaded only with great difficulty by the Bailo of Venice in\r\nConstantinople.[697] After Mohacs two thousand heads were set on poles\r\nabout his tent.[698] To Western eyes it seems a blot upon the noble and\r\ngenerous character of Suleiman, that he treated the heads of his enemies\r\nand of condemned criminals after the fashion of his time and country.\r\nAside from the question of barbarity and cruelty, however, the policy\r\nof summary and certain execution of offenders was essential to the\r\nmaintenance of the Ottoman Ruling Institution in power. It was a process\r\nof pruning, by which every dangerous growth was cut away. Had it not been\r\ndone, the system would have seemed today more commendable, but it could\r\nhardly have failed to perish quickly. A century after Suleiman the remark\r\nwas made that what preserved the Ottoman state was the quickness and\r\nseverity of justice for crimes which had relation to the government.[699]\r\n\r\nWhat was the general character of Ottoman justice? It is to be feared\r\nthat it was often venal. A few years after Suleiman’s death a Western\r\nwriter expressed the opinion that the only incorruptible courts were\r\nthose of the grand vizier and the Divan.[700] Another charged that\r\nChristian subjects had unfair treatment before the courts, in which they\r\nwere not allowed to testify, since some of the Moslems considered it\r\nalmost a meritorious religious act to turn a case against a Christian by\r\nfalse testimony.[701] It is probable, however, that the Ottoman courts\r\nin Suleiman’s time were reasonably just. The judges were well-paid,\r\nhighly honored, and carefully inspected by honest men who were sent out\r\nannually by the _Kaziaskers_;[702] nevertheless, many of them no doubt\r\nyielded to the same desire for money that afflicted the _kullar_. In at\r\nleast one respect the Ottoman courts were highly to be commended: there\r\nwas a minimum of trouble because of the “law’s delay.” Cases were always\r\ndecided promptly, and in clear and simple terms. An unjust decision\r\nquickly given is often less expensive and less annoying in the long run\r\nthan tardy justice.[703]\r\n\r\nSome Western observers were as strongly impressed with the superiority\r\nof Ottoman justice over that in their own lands as they were with the\r\nsuperiority of discipline in the Ottoman camp, or of promotion by merit\r\nin the Ottoman government service.[704] One of them said: “To understand\r\nat length their diligence in justice, it would be necessary to write more\r\nthan I have done; and further, since there is nothing here [that is, in\r\nFrance] so near immorality as the processes and extortions which men do,\r\nit gives me shame to recite so great diligence among people proclaimed\r\nwicked; this it is, without any doubt, which makes them so to rule,\r\nconquer, and keep.... Of Sultan Suleiman, who rules at present, I do not\r\nwish to speak, for his deeds are not yet accomplished, and he cannot yet\r\nbe praised, except for his humanity, justice, and fidelity.”[705]\r\n\r\nThe law which the judges administered was primarily the Sacred Law,\r\nas given in the Koran and the traditions of Mohammed, but especially\r\nas codified by the great doctors of the school of Abu Hanifa, and as\r\ninterpreted in collections of the _fetvas_ of great jurists. Next\r\nthe judges applied the _Kanuns_ of the sultans, and the customs and\r\nimmunities of the regions in which they served.[706] Finally, they had a\r\nconsiderable field in which to make use of equity: “The good sense and\r\nprudence of judges trained in reasoning,” says Postel, “supplies and\r\ndecides many things that are not written.”[707] The only resemblance to\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon system of case law seems to have been the use of the\r\n_fetvas_ of the _muftis_. Since the hearing of ordinary cases was summary\r\nand decisions were rendered very briefly, no extended reports were\r\npossible. The absence of printing, which was not introduced into Turkey\r\nuntil the eighteenth century, aided further toward making a general use\r\nof the decisions of judges as precedents practically impossible. In\r\nthose days judges relied upon their own knowledge of law and custom,\r\non the few books they might possess, on their sense of equity, and, in\r\nmatters of difficulty, on the opinions of the local _muftis_. Since\r\nthe judges were not each surrounded by a group of trained and keenly\r\nwatchful lawyers, but acted alone except for their own subordinates,\r\nthere was more opportunity for unjust decisions by a dishonest judge than\r\namong English-speaking peoples. Or, to state the matter differently,\r\nOttoman justice depended more upon the integrity of judges than does\r\nAnglo-Saxon justice. Although the Sacred Law was rigid, its application\r\nto the individual case was adjustable, and adjustment was ordinarily\r\naccomplished by the decision of one man. Judges therefore possessed great\r\npower over the fortunes of individuals, a fact which in part explains the\r\ngreat deference and honor that was shown them.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOSLEM INSTITUTION AS A WHOLE\r\n\r\nA few words of summary will sketch the outlines of the complete Moslem\r\nInstitution in the Ottoman Empire. It represented and maintained the\r\nentire system that was based upon the life and work of the Prophet\r\nMohammed. This system claimed to be sufficient for all sides of the\r\ntemporal, as well as for the eternal, life of all individuals, and\r\nfor the life of the state which they constituted; it also provided a\r\nplace for subject peoples and resident foreigners of other religious\r\naffiliations. The power of the institution extended over the whole\r\nempire, even beyond the limits of political control.\r\n\r\nThe Moslem Institution was firmly grounded in the allegiance, the\r\nfundamental beliefs, and the affections of the entire Moslem-born\r\npopulation of the empire. It is true that not all Moslems believed\r\nexactly alike, nor did they all practise the Sacred Law according to the\r\nsystem of Abu Hanifa. But they were all fiercely and proudly Moslems,\r\nand devoted to the supremacy of the Mohammedan system in this world, as\r\nexpressed in an institution which might not be what every one wished,\r\nbut which revealed and maintained the power of Islam. All the Moslems of\r\nthe empire were in a sense members of the institution. In the sixteenth\r\ncentury any one of them might hope to see his son mount to a very high\r\nplace within the organization, since industrious study combined with\r\nnative ability was all that was demanded. Opportunities in the way of\r\nschools were present nearly everywhere; and a student who once had shown\r\nhis aptitude would be carried forward, without expense to his relatives,\r\nby funds which had been provided by sultans and pious individuals “for\r\nthe good of their souls.” The Moslem Institution was fundamentally\r\ndemocratic. It was united in complete solidarity and perfect harmony with\r\nall in the empire who were attached to the doctrines of the Prophet. All\r\nbelievers were equal before God, and all were supposed to have equal\r\nopportunity to rise to places of honor in the system.\r\n\r\nDistinction and membership in the institution proper rested upon birth\r\nin the case of the descendants of Mohammed, upon profession of piety and\r\nspecial religious service in the case of the dervishes, but upon learned\r\nknowledge of the Sacred Law in all positions of public influence and\r\nimportance. The three highly-honored classes of teachers, jurists, and\r\njudges were trained in the same superbly-planned educational system, in\r\nthe same text-books and the same ideas. Whether in Constantinople or\r\nCairo, the Crimea or Algiers, Budapest or Bagdad, old, grave, wise, and\r\nlearned professors, jurists, and judges taught, interpreted, and enforced\r\nthe same wide-reaching and changeless Sacred Law. As teachers, the\r\n_Ulema_ conveyed to children and youth, in impressible years, that which\r\nthey had themselves received. The same learned persons, after fixing\r\neach part of the whole round of legal studies in their minds by periods\r\nof teaching, were advanced to places where they dealt not with boys, but\r\nwith men, where their work affected not the fortunes of individuals,\r\nbut the destinies of the empire. Yet their influence was exerted\r\nstrenuously in the same direction throughout, to impress and perpetuate\r\nthe changeless body of ideas in the Sacred Law. Professors, jurists,\r\nand judges alike were, in all that they did and throughout their lives,\r\nfundamentally teachers. The _Ulema_ taught all the Moslems of the empire,\r\nfrom the young child to the aged sultan. They maintained schools for the\r\nyoung; places of worship, courts, and offices of consultation for adults.\r\nEvery important officer of administrative government had a judge and a\r\n_mufti_ at his elbow. Not only was the sultan himself in close relations\r\nwith the _Kaziaskers_ and the _Mufti,_ but he had always a spiritual\r\nadviser to whom he showed great deference, and who bore the significant\r\ntitle of the sultan’s _Hoja_, or teacher. There was an aspect in which\r\nthe Moslem Institution, based upon the Moslem population of the empire,\r\nfitted the government as hand fits glove. This figure, moreover, can be\r\npressed beyond the mere comparison of shape; the hand is of much the same\r\nefficiency with or without the glove, while the glove is useless without\r\nthe hand; furthermore, the hand may live to wear a succession of gloves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON OF THE TWO GREAT INSTITUTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ottoman Ruling Institution, and the Moslem Institution of the Ottoman\r\nEmpire might be compared, contrasted, and reflected upon at great length.\r\nIn this discussion, however, it must suffice to select and comment upon a\r\nfew of their salient likenesses, differences, and interactions, without\r\nattempting to separate such features sharply.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIKENESSES\r\n\r\nBoth institutions were constructed out of old and well-seasoned\r\nmaterials. Many of the ideas in each can be followed back until their\r\norigin is lost in prehistoric obscurity; hardly a feature in either but\r\nhad a clear derivation from, relationship to, or suggestion in, some\r\nprototype of pre-Ottoman days. Only the final structure of each, the\r\nproportion and composition of its parts, and the effect of the completed\r\nwhole was worked out in the Ottoman Empire. If an attempt be made, in a\r\nvery general way, to distinguish the main lines of influence which led\r\nup to the two institutions, it may be said that the Ruling Institution\r\nhad its nucleus of ideas from the Turks of the steppe lands. Influenced\r\nby old Persian neighbors and Chinese rulers, the original group of ideas\r\nwas brought into the Moslem Empire and Asia Minor by the predecessors of\r\nthe Seljuk Turks and by the Seljuk Turks themselves. Coming into contact\r\nin Asia Minor with the ideas of the Byzantine Empire, and to some extent\r\nwith those of the crusaders from the West, the system took on a large\r\nnumber of new features; and the Ottomans continued the process in Asia\r\nMinor and Southeastern Europe until the time of Suleiman. The Moslem\r\nInstitution began with the ideas of the Arabs as combined by Mohammed\r\nwith Jewish, Middle Persian, and Christian influences. Political notions\r\nwere rapidly incorporated from those prevailing in Byzantine Syria and\r\nEgypt, and perhaps to a greater extent from those in the Sassanian\r\nPersian Empire. A compact system of ideas began early to be developed,\r\nand in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries it reached final scholastic\r\nshape. Together with its institutional embodiments, it began to pass to\r\nthe Ottomans in their earliest days; and, as the nation grew, it grew\r\ninto the Moslem Institution of the Ottoman Empire, fresh power being\r\ngiven to it by Selim’s conquest of the old Moslem lands, and especially\r\nby his acquisition of the over-lordship of the Holy Cities. The two lines\r\nof tendency which led to the two great Ottoman institutions were first\r\nbrought into contact when, in the seventh century, the Arab conquest of\r\nPersia advanced the Moslem frontier into Central Asia. From that time\r\nto the reign of Suleiman reciprocal influence was exerted, although the\r\nMoslem ideas affected the Turkish much more than the Turkish did the\r\nMoslem.\r\n\r\nBoth of the great Ottoman institutions were founded upon groups of\r\nideas and not upon racial descent. This subject, discussed above in the\r\nIntroduction, has been shown to be true to an extreme in the Ruling\r\nInstitution, which drew its members from every direction except from the\r\nexisting stock of the nation. The Moslem Institution embodied a religion\r\nof universal claim. Though originally given to the Arabs, the Moslem\r\nfaith was intrinsically independent of race, as its subsequent history\r\nrevealed. Belief, and not blood, became the sole test of membership. This\r\ncommon hospitality of its two great institutions to all who might wish\r\nto join them laid firmly the foundation of the Ottoman nation, and made\r\npossible the greatness and the permanence of its dominion.\r\n\r\nBoth Ottoman institutions were self-perpetuating through education.\r\nEach had a great educational system which was adapted to its special\r\ncharacter, and which was life-long in extent. The Ruling Institution\r\ntrained its pupils physically as well as mentally, whereas the Moslem\r\nInstitution neglected physical education in favor of a greater amount of\r\nintellectual training. Otherwise their work was largely parallel. One\r\ninstitution took its pupils from the children of Christian subjects and\r\nneighbors, and trained them to conquer and to rule. The other took its\r\npupils from the children of Moslems and trained them to know, practise,\r\nteach, and enforce the Moslem rules of law and life. The one system\r\nraised the ablest Christian-born individuals to the highest positions,\r\nand the other raised the ablest Moslem-born individuals similarly. Both\r\ncontinually brought in new material at the bottom, and continually worked\r\nupon all their material to increase its value. Each offered such rewards\r\nand promotions as to induce its members to put forth their most strenuous\r\nexertions, that they might develop their own powers and visibly help\r\ntheir institution. Whatever faults of plan and structure the institutions\r\nmay have had, they were able to survive all dangers and disasters largely\r\nthrough the trained ability of the individuals whom their educational\r\nsystems had brought to the front.\r\n\r\nBoth institutions rose to an apex, through the Divan and the grand\r\nvizier, in the sultan, who was the head and center of each. Yet the ideas\r\nby which the two institutions were joined to their head were in striking\r\ncontrast. The sultan was master and owner of the Ruling Institution; he\r\nwas the divinely-appointed chief of the Moslem Institution. The members\r\nof the former obeyed him as slaves; the members of the latter obeyed\r\nhim as free Moslems commanded by the Sacred Law to render allegiance\r\nto the chief interpreter and defender of that law. The former knew no\r\npower greater than the sultan’s; the latter relied upon the Sacred Law\r\nas above the sultan. The Ruling Institution was extended downward in\r\neach of its parts from the sultan’s authority, and in organization and\r\nmembership depended for existence upon his will. The Moslem Institution\r\nrose upward from the people, and was attached almost artificially to the\r\nsultan’s authority. Suleiman regulated the grades of higher advancement\r\nin it, but the sultans who came after him touched the organization of the\r\ninstitution scarcely at all. Very seldom, moreover, by comparison, did\r\nthe sultans punish the members of this institution; for the most part its\r\nwork went on quite independently of them. But the sultan was the head of\r\nboth institutions: every member of each looked upward along converging\r\nlines which met at the foot of his throne. The highest promotions in\r\neach were made by him directly, the honored men being put into positions\r\nnear their sovereign.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIFFERENCES\r\n\r\nThe fact that the Ruling Institution was recruited from Christian\r\nslaves and the Moslem Institution from Moslem freemen led to a\r\nprofound difference of spirit. The Christian slaves, newly converted\r\nto Mohammedanism, were not as a body so closely attached to the Sacred\r\nLaw as were the Moslem freemen. Their loyalty being rather to one man,\r\ntheir master and benefactor, they felt a servile devotion which was very\r\ndifferent from the reasoned allegiance of those who had always been free.\r\nA _Mufti_, fortified by the Sacred Law, would firmly oppose the will of\r\nthe sovereign in a case where a grand vizier would scarcely dare venture\r\na mildly contrary suggestion. The Sacred Law, despite the introduction of\r\nall later influences, still breathed forth something of the freedom of\r\nthe Arabian desert: in one or two generations, as has been seen, it could\r\nrender its followers unfit to be slaves. Thus the spirit of the Ruling\r\nInstitution was far less independent of personal authority than that of\r\nthe Moslem Institution.\r\n\r\nAs to the authority of old ideas the contrary was true. The fundamental\r\ndistinction of parties in modern states seems to rest upon a greater\r\nor less relative inclination to follow old paths or to enter upon new\r\nones. Both institutions of the Ottoman state would in modern times be\r\nclassed as strongly conservative, but of the two the Moslem Institution\r\nwas by far the more so. Conservatism, in fact, was of the very essence\r\nof the Sacred Law. The early Turks had also loved their _Adet_, but not\r\nso much as to be unwilling quickly to adopt the new if they saw in it\r\ndistinct advantage; the rise of the Ottoman power was, indeed, marked\r\nby the constant incorporation of new ideas, devices, and methods.[708]\r\nAs the Moslem influence grew, however, changes became increasingly more\r\ndifficult to make; and when they were made it was by the activity of the\r\nRuling Institution, usually against the resistance or the inert passivity\r\nof the Moslem Institution.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the Ruling Institution fought and governed while the Moslem\r\nInstitution thought and judged was, of course, highly significant: the\r\nformer embodied the active, the latter the contemplative, principle of\r\nthe nation. Here again is involved a difference of Turk and Saracen.\r\nIn the steppe lands the Turk fought, obeyed, and gave orders; after\r\nthe fever of conquest was abated, the Saracen, under Islam, thought,\r\npreserved intellectual independence, and worshipped. With the two\r\ncharacters placed side by side, it was in the nature of things that in\r\nthe long run muscle would be controlled by mind.\r\n\r\nBy comparison with the Moslem Institution, the Ruling Institution\r\npossessed a great structural disadvantage, in that it was much more\r\nartificial and therefore much less stable. It admitted its members as\r\nslaves, but they were not hereditary slaves; most of them were free-born\r\nsubjects of the empire or of the neighboring Christian states. A class of\r\nhereditary slaves would not have possessed the requisite mettle. Now, the\r\nacquisition of a large number of free-born children who can be made into\r\nslaves is hardly a process that can be continued indefinitely. Conquest\r\nhad its limits for the Ottoman Empire, for boundaries were reached beyond\r\nwhich lay states whose powers of self-defense developed increasingly;\r\naccordingly, recruiting by capture became increasingly difficult. But the\r\nlevying of children as tribute was strongly against human nature; and\r\nin the long run it, too, must lead to decline, for under its operation\r\nthe best were taken and inferiors were left. Furthermore, not only\r\nwere children separated from their parents against the wishes of the\r\nparents, but the recruits, when they grew up, were not encouraged to form\r\nfamily ties. Even when they did so, they were unable to advance their\r\nchildren as they had been advanced themselves, and they could not be\r\nsure of conveying their property to their descendants. Thus in several\r\nrespects the Ruling Institution ran counter to the idea of the family.\r\nOn the other hand, the advantages given to the sultan’s _kullar_ became\r\ntoo great not to be coveted; and it was not natural that the free-born\r\nMoslems should continue to let outsiders be the only recipients of\r\nso much wealth, power, and privilege. The Moslem population forced\r\nits way in, and the plan of the Ruling Institution was upset. The\r\nMoslem Institution, on the contrary, was recruited voluntarily from an\r\nincreasing population; hence, as its advantages became attractive, it was\r\nbenefited rather than harmed by pressure for admission. Its able men,\r\nwhile they must labor if they would advance, were free, unhindered in\r\ntheir family relationships, and under little fear of being deprived of\r\nproperty or life.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERACTIONS\r\n\r\nThe two institutions, running everywhere parallel, with their members\r\nin constant association one with the other, could not fail to act\r\nreciprocally upon each other. It is not easy, however, to discriminate\r\nlikenesses that were due to mutual influence from those that were caused\r\nby common circumstances; nor is it easy to distinguish pre-Ottoman\r\ninteractions from those which operated after the beginning of the\r\nfourteenth century. A few probabilities may be expressed, however.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of frequent remark that men, institutions, and peoples\r\nare apt to impart to each other their faults and vices more readily\r\nthan their good qualities. Whether or not this be true, the two Ottoman\r\ninstitutions certainly seem to have taught each other some evil\r\nqualities. Luxury, venality, and unnatural vices were all strongly\r\ndiscountenanced by the Sacred Law; but all were fostered in the members\r\nof the Ruling Institution by the very conditions of the system, and by\r\nthe sixteenth century all had come to be charged against the members of\r\nthe Moslem Institution as well. On the other hand, the conservatism of\r\nthe Moslem Institution and its resistance to progress came more and more\r\nto characterize the Ruling Institution. Members of the _Ulema_ taught\r\neven the pages of the palace and the princes on the intellectual side\r\nof their training, thereby exerting a constant influence which in the\r\ncourse of time operated powerfully on the Ruling Institution from top to\r\nbottom, till it, too, began to acquire a changelessness which resisted\r\nimprovement and progress. With such a character once established, the end\r\nof the empire’s greatness was at hand. In a rapidly progressing world, a\r\nstationary position means a relative decline.\r\n\r\nThe two institutions contributed strongly to each other’s power and\r\npermanence. The Ruling Institution defended the Moslem Institution by\r\nthe sword, and carried out among the people the decisions of its wise\r\nmen. It also protected the latter’s sources of regular revenue, and thus\r\nenabled the _Ulema_, secure of a living, to devote themselves to the\r\nstudy and teaching of the Sacred Law. The Moslem Institution, on the\r\nother hand, kept the Moslem population obedient and submissive to the\r\nsultan’s authority as expressed in the Ruling Institution. It taught that\r\nthe Sultan was divinely appointed and therefore always to be obeyed, no\r\nmatter what his character was or how oppressive his rule might become,\r\nso long as he did not transgress the Sacred Law; and that it was for\r\nthe _Ulema_ alone to decide when he had made such a transgression.\r\nAccordingly the two institutions, so long as they acted in harmony, were\r\nabsolutely impregnable in their position among the Moslems of the empire.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RELATIVE POWER OF THE INSTITUTIONS\r\n\r\nThese two institutions constituted, as it were, the two great\r\nparties in the Ottoman state.[709] The Moslem Institution was always\r\nstrongly Islamic, and extremely conservative in all respects. The\r\nRuling Institution was originally liberal both religiously and in its\r\nreceptivity of new ideas, but it departed from its liberal tendency in\r\nmuch the same proportion that the Moslem Institution increased in power.\r\n\r\nTo trace the ups and downs of the influence of the two institutions from\r\nthe beginnings of Ottoman history would be an interesting problem. Much\r\ndepended of course, as must always be the case in a despotic state,\r\non the character of the sultan. With an active conquering sultan like\r\nMohammed II or Selim I, the Ruling Institution would gain upon its rival;\r\nwith a pious or mild sultan like Murad II or Bayezid II, the Moslem\r\nInfluence would increase in importance. Selim I’s vast conquests in\r\nMoslem territories, and his acquisition of the protectorate of the Holy\r\nCities and of the title of caliph, prepared the way for a later advance\r\nin the power of the Moslem Institution which was not in harmony with\r\nhis own personal influence. Suleiman had a fiery active period of youth\r\nwhen the liberal policy was stronger in his mind, and a quieter old age\r\nwhen the Moslem influence became predominant; it is not unlikely that\r\na consciousness of his position as caliph grew upon him with advancing\r\nyears. But in general, through all the reigns, the power of the Moslem\r\nInstitution grew; the only difference from reign to reign was in the rate\r\nof speed. The Ruling Institution also grew in power before the world and\r\nthe Ottoman nation as long as the empire continued to expand rapidly; but\r\nit did not grow relatively so fast as did the Moslem Institution.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for the more rapid growth of Moslem influence lay chiefly in\r\nthe fact that that influence was cumulative. As to its financial basis,\r\nthe Moslem Institution, like the Christian church in the West, gained\r\nlands and wealth continually, and never lost any; for sultans took great\r\npride, and high officials vied with each other, in founding mosques,\r\nschools, colleges, and other charitable and semi-public institutions\r\nsupported by _vakfs_.[710] In general moral and political influence,\r\nalso, the institution gained rapidly through its system of education;\r\nfor, like the medieval Christian church again, it held in its hands all\r\nthe means and methods of intellectual development. Every new primary\r\nschool, college, and law school,—and they were many in the days of\r\nglory,—strengthened the influence of this institution. In this field,\r\nindeed, its power acted constantly upon its rival. Old _Hojas_ taught\r\nthe pages in the palace, advised the sultan’s mother, and trained the\r\nyoung princes and the sons of high officials. Thus within the nation the\r\nexternal show of the Moslem Institution, and its sway over the minds of\r\nmen, grew without ceasing.\r\n\r\nThe Ruling Institution, on the other hand, lost relatively. In the early\r\ndays, when recent converts were exceedingly numerous and the religious\r\nspirit of the young nation was weak, the Turkish-Aryan organization\r\nwas far stronger than the Semitic influence. Sultans, however, were\r\nconstantly giving away state lands as endowment for new mosques and\r\ncolleges; and, worse still, so much of the educational system of this\r\ninstitution as was not controlled by its rival was directed only toward\r\nits own membership and not toward the nation at large. Accordingly,\r\nalthough the Ruling Institution grew in wealth and power, it did not keep\r\npace with the Moslem Institution, which, after two and a half centuries\r\nof gain, was able to overtake it about the time of Suleiman’s reign. His\r\ngifts of great mosques, numerous colleges, and vast endowment,[711] his\r\narrangement in final perfection of the _cursus honorum_ which led up from\r\nthe primary schools to the office of _Mufti_, and the personal leaning of\r\nhis later years toward the influence of the _Ulema_, settled permanently\r\nthe preponderance of the Moslem Institution.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the Moslem Institution could never destroy its rival.\r\nTheoretically it had no need of such a counterpart. Mohammed and the\r\nearly caliphs had no such institution. The Sacred Law developed with no\r\nmention of a secular government, and with no hint of any deficiency in\r\nits own provisions that would make it inadequate to guide a nation by its\r\nown strength; but, within thirty years from the death of Mohammed, Muavia\r\nhad set up a secular government at Damascus, and since then every Moslem\r\nstate had had one. Many a Moslem state, also, had had a ruler who was not\r\nof lawful blood; for the Sacred Law affirmed that the _Imâm_, or divinely\r\nappointed ruler, must be of the tribe of the Koreish.[712] According to\r\nthat unenforced provision, Suleiman himself had no right to the throne.\r\nThe fact is that the Moslem Institution very early became too unworldly\r\nto live unsupported by a secular power. It was a strong but tender\r\nhand, which must always wear a glove. After it had acquired a permanent\r\nascendency in the state, therefore, the Moslem Institution was compelled\r\nto keep its rival in place, and to allow it always strength enough to\r\ndefend and support the empire which nourished both.\r\n\r\nBound together closely in an alliance which neither enjoyed, but which\r\nwas necessary for the preservation of both, the Ruling Institution and\r\nthe Moslem Institution constituted the twofold inner framework of the\r\nOttoman Empire, to which it owed all its might and energy, its grandeur\r\nand repute, its continuity and durability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDICES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND BOOK OF THE AFFAIRS OF THE TURKS\r\n\r\nWritten in 1534, supposedly by Benedetto Ramberti\r\n\r\nTranslated from the Italian\r\n\r\n[From _Libri Tre delle Cose de Turchi_, as printed in _Viaggi ... alla\r\ntana_, Venice, 1543, pp. 131-146.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAs from a laborious and very dangerous sea into a safe and very quiet\r\nport, one enters the city of Constantinople, after the great trouble and\r\ninconvenience of the ride which he has endured over the long road.[713]\r\nThis city (to continue until I have here made an end of particular\r\ndescription) was anciently called Byzantium, and afterwards was called\r\nNew Rome, and then Constantinople from the first Constantine. Byzantium,\r\nas it is reported, was in the region where Pera is now, and was so named\r\nfrom the river Byzantium, which afterward, by reason of an earthquake\r\nsuch as are frequent in that region, changed its course elsewhere. But I\r\ndo not believe this, nor does it seem to me to agree with the description\r\nof Polybius and other writers, who call those here Chalcedonians;\r\nthese, when they might themselves in ancient times have built upon this\r\nsite, did not care for it, but built in Asia, not having discerned the\r\nconvenience and beauty they were leaving to others; who might deprive\r\nthem even of their own site, as indeed happened.\r\n\r\nThe city is 18 miles in circuit. It has seven little hills, not very\r\nhigh. It is surrounded by wretched walls, and is full of houses, not many\r\nof which are good, being made of clay and wood and only a few of stone.\r\nIt is full of groves, that is, of places wild and uninhabited, where\r\ncypresses grow, and other such trees.[714] In Constantinople, then, is\r\nthe palace of the Turkish Signor, which is a singular structure and very\r\nlarge, as will be told later.\r\n\r\nThere is the palace of the ladies of the Signor, the palace of the\r\nJanissaries, the Patriarcate, the palace of the Emperor Constantine,\r\nwhich is in part ruined, the church of St. Sophia, which is a structure\r\nmost beautiful and divine; this was built by the Emperor Justinian from\r\nthe oldest and finest columns and marbles, as one can see now; in part\r\nof it the Turkish Signor has made stalls for his horses. There is the\r\nmosque of Sultan Mohammed, which has an _Imaret_ attached to it that is\r\nlike a hostel; in which they lodge any one, of any nation or law, who may\r\nwish to enter, and they give him food for three days,—honey, rice, meat,\r\nbread, and water, and a room in which to sleep. They say that from day\r\nto day there are more than a thousand guests from various nations. Near\r\nthis they have baths and some fountains, most beautiful and delightful to\r\nbehold. There are the mosques of Sultan Bayezid, Sultan Selim, and other\r\nSignors, which are very beautiful and exceedingly well-built. This makes\r\nit clear that, when they wish, they know also how to build houses and\r\npalaces that are magnificent and sumptuous.\r\n\r\nThere is the Hippodrome, that is, the place where in ancient times horses\r\nwere made to run as in a theater and circus: in the center of this\r\nHippodrome there stands a needle, which is a column made in the form of\r\na needle, very beautiful and wrought very well and without mortar, made\r\nof living rocks joined together in such a manner that they rise through\r\nmore than fifty cubits, tapering in the shape of a needle, which rests\r\non four marble balls.[715] There is a column of bronze in the shape of a\r\nserpent with three heads.[716] There is a bronze Hercules brought from\r\nHungary,[717] and in the center there is a colossal structure made of\r\ndifferent beautiful marbles, in which is engraved the history of all\r\nthe above-mentioned objects, and of other things which used to stand in\r\nthe Theater and Hippodrome. There are throughout the city many vestiges\r\nof antiquities, such as aqueducts, arches, porphyry columns, fountains\r\nbrought from the Danube and other near-by rivers.[718] Many gardens about\r\nthe houses of the great. Many mosques of private lords, and baths which\r\nare attached to the mosques of private men and of public magistrates.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the sea from the Seraglio Point are the hills of\r\nAsia, and the journey is of a little more or less than two miles; this\r\nAsia is today called by a single name Anatolia; and there are on the\r\nshore there some fortresses called Scutari. Then Kadikeui, situated\r\non a bay of the Hellespont,[719] where one can see many vestiges of\r\nantiquities; and I, when I went there, saw underground where men were\r\nworking, a well of the finest marble with an aqueduct which came to\r\nthe center of the well, and a canopy of fine marble supported by four\r\nbeautiful columns. And in other places there appear many vestiges of\r\nold churches, both of Christians and of heathen, places indeed most\r\nbeautiful, most pleasant, most fruitful. The situation of Constantinople\r\nis such that not only can it not be described adequately, but it can\r\nhardly be grasped in thought because of its loveliness. Certainly it is\r\nrather to be considered divine than otherwise. Nor is there any one who\r\nhas seen it who has not judged it worthy to be ranked above all other\r\nsituations in the world.\r\n\r\nThere are in the city besides the Turks, countless Jews, or Marrani\r\nexpelled from Spain;[720] these are they who have taught and who are\r\nteaching every useful art to the Turks;[721] and the greater part of the\r\nshops and arts are kept and exercised by these Marrani. There is a place\r\nwhich is called _Bezestan_, where they sell and buy all sorts of cloth\r\nand Turkish wares, silks, stuffs, linens, silver, wrought gold, bows,\r\nslaves, and horses; and in short all the things that are to be found in\r\nConstantinople are brought there to market: this, except for Friday, is\r\nopen every day.\r\n\r\nConstantinople is in Thrace: this has as its boundaries on the east the\r\nPropontis and the mouths of the greater sea, on the west part of Bulgaria\r\nand part of Macedonia, on the north Bosnia, on the south the Aegean Sea\r\nwith part of Macedonia which lies toward the river Nishava, called in\r\nancient times the Nesus.[722]\r\n\r\nThis most noble city is inhabited by Turks: these as the more reliable\r\nauthors have written, and as many of the Turks themselves have confirmed\r\nto me, had their origin in Scythia, which now is a part of Tartary, a\r\nnorthern region divided into two parts by the river Don: one of these\r\nparts is in Europe, and one in Asia.[723] The European part is bounded\r\non one side by Pontus, and on the other by the Riphean Mountains, and\r\nat the back by Asia proper and the river Taspus. In Ptolemy these two\r\nScythias are called the one _intra Imaum montem_, and the other _extra\r\nImaum_. They departed then from Scythia (as is said above) and began to\r\nmake invasions and raids into their present confines: then proceeding\r\nfarther, in a short time they became lords of a good part of Asia, but\r\nbecause they did not know how to keep only one chief among them, they\r\nhad no foundation or firmness. This circumstance having been considered\r\nby one who was called Othman, a man of low rank among them, but of lofty\r\nand valorous mind, he thought that, by having the arm and the favor of\r\nsome men of intelligence and authority, he could easily rule all this\r\npeople and the conquered territory, and increase it further upon good\r\nopportunity: then having revealed this his thought to three persons, who\r\nseemed more suitable than others for this business, he promised that\r\nthose by means of whom he might acquire the dominion to which he aspired,\r\nhe would always maintain, both themselves and their descendants, in\r\ngreat state and dignity, and suitably to the great benefit which he had\r\nreceived from them: besides this that he would never harm their blood nor\r\nthat of their posterity through laws that would lay hands upon them even\r\nif they should transgress grievously.[724] They accepted the condition\r\nand conspired together for the sovereignty; which they obtained by\r\nastuteness, artfulness, threats, and the slaughter of many. These three\r\nwere called, the one Michael, a Greek who had turned Turk; from him the\r\nMarcalogli[725] are descended; one of them is now Sanjak in Bosnia. The\r\nsecond was Malco, a Greek renegade; from him have come the Malcozogli,\r\nand there is now only one, who is Sanjak in Greece. The third was Aurami,\r\na native Turk; his descendants were called the Eurcasli; it is not now\r\nknown that any of these remain. In case the Ottoman family should fail,\r\nthese would pretend to the sovereignty, and therefore they are highly\r\nrespected.\r\n\r\nThis Othman came to power about the year 1300, and lived in lordship\r\ntwenty-eight years:[726] Orchan succeeded him and lived twenty-two years\r\nin the kingship. Then Murad who reigned twenty-three years. Then Bayezid.\r\nThen Chiris Celeby, or, as others wish, Calepino, who lived about six\r\nyears. Then Mohammed, who reigned fourteen years.[727] Then Murad II who\r\nreigned 31 years. Then Mohammed II who reigned 32 years and was the first\r\nEmperor of Constantinople. Then Bayezid II who reigned 31 years. Then\r\nSelim eight years: to him succeeded Sultan Suleiman, his only son, who\r\nreigns at present. Of this succession it is written otherwise in some\r\nhistories, where they treat of wars and peaces, which have been made by\r\nour republic in times past with this family: but since I have recounted\r\nthese in other places, it now suffices to have noticed the common opinion\r\nof those who have written of the affairs of the Turks up to this time.\r\nAnd so I will go on to describe the court of this Signor: it is arranged\r\nin the following manner.[728]\r\n\r\nSULTAN SULEIMAN has a palace in the angle of Constantinople by the two\r\nseas:[729] this is in circuit about three miles: and in it are his\r\nresidence and his court, which is called the PORTE. This palace, because\r\nit was begun to be built by Sultan Mohammed, he willed when dying that\r\nit should be rent-paying property of his mosque, and that it should pay\r\na thousand aspers a day, which are twenty ducats; and this has been\r\nobserved to the present.[730]\r\n\r\nHe has in the aforesaid palace countless highly ornamented chambers,\r\nbut one among the others is set apart for himself: in this he sleeps,\r\nand he has there six youths who serve his person.[731] Of these six,\r\ntwo are deputed for the service of the chamber and the Signor during\r\nthe day, and then in the night the same ones come to keep guard when he\r\nsleeps: these stand ever vigilant, the one at his head and the other at\r\nhis feet, with two lighted torches in their hands: these two then in\r\nthe morning when they clothe the aforesaid Signor, put into one of the\r\npocket-purses of his caftan a thousand aspers, and into the other twenty\r\ngolden ducats; whatever of this money is not given away by the Signor\r\nduring the day, remains to those who undress him at night; they never\r\nfind much in the garments, according to report. And always when he goes\r\nforth to enjoy the chase or for some other purpose, besides the aforesaid\r\nmoney which he carries, he is accustomed always to have behind him the\r\n_Khazinehdar-bashi_, or chief treasurer; this man carries with him a\r\ngreat sum of money to be given away.\r\n\r\nThe duty of the aforesaid six youths, who are changed according to the\r\nwill of the Signor, is: of one to be _Papuji_,[732] or him who bears the\r\nshoes, of another _Silihdar_, who bears the bow and arrows, of another\r\n_Chokadar_, who bears the garments, of another _Sharabdar_, who bears the\r\npitcher of water, of another _Iskemleji_, who carries the stool, and then\r\nof the sixth to be _Oda-bashi_, or chief of the Chamber. These have a\r\nfixed salary of 15 to 20, and the _Oda-bashi_ of 30 aspers per day.\r\n\r\n  Next comes\r\n\r\n  The eunuch _Kapu Aghasi_,[734] or chief of the gate, who has 60\r\n    aspers per day.\r\n\r\n  The _Khazinehdar-bashi_, a eunuch, chief treasurer, 60\r\n    aspers.[733]\r\n\r\n  The _Kilerji-bashi_, chief of the butlers, 40 aspers.\r\n\r\n  The _Seraidar-bashi_,[734] a eunuch, chief of the palace when\r\n    the Signor is away; he has 50 aspers. Twelve eunuchs subject to\r\n    the aforesaid, with 10 to 15 aspers each.\r\n\r\nThere are next about five hundred youths aged from eight to twenty years,\r\nwho reside in the palace and are the delight of the Signor: they have\r\neach from ten to twelve aspers per day; they are instructed in various\r\narts according to their genius, but especially in reading, writing,\r\nand in the doctrine of their laws, and in riding. The masters are old\r\n_Danishmends_,[735] called _Hojas_, or doctors of the laws. These boys\r\nat the season of Bairam, which is like our Easter day, are clothed by\r\nthe Signor, some with silk and some with cloth, without any uniformity;\r\nand each has a golden bonnet, a scimitar, and a bow: they never leave\r\nthe aforesaid palace until they have reached the age when the Signor\r\nthinks them fit for offices: and then he makes them _Spahi-oghlans_, or\r\n_Silihdars_, or of higher degrees according to their worth and the favor\r\nwhich they have gained with the Signor. Each ten of them are guarded by\r\na eunuch called _Kapu-oghlan_, or chief of youths,[736] and each has a\r\nslave’s frock, in which he sleeps rolled up in such a manner that he\r\ndoes not touch another who may be near him. They reside in a large hall,\r\nfull of great lights and spacious, and their eunuchs sleep in the middle\r\nof this hall. They have a garden in the palace, which extends more than\r\na mile, in which reside about thirty-five gardeners, called _Bostanjis_,\r\nwho are _Ajem-oghlans_:[737] these gardeners have from three to five\r\naspers each per day; they are clothed in blue cloth, and given a shirt.\r\nThen when they leave the palace, they become Janissaries, or _Solaks_, or\r\n_Kapujis_, or something else according to their quality.\r\n\r\n  The _Bostanji-bashi_, or chief gardener, has fifty aspers a day\r\n    and many perquisites.\r\n\r\n  The _Kiaya_,[738] who is, as it were, a lieutenant for the\r\n    gardeners, has 20 aspers per day; and each ten [gardeners] have\r\n    a chief called _Boluk-bashi_. From this garden, which is very\r\n    large and well-tended, full of excellent fruit-trees of every\r\n    sort, they obtain so much every year that from the product\r\n    of it alone they make the living expenses of the Signor, and\r\n    also get something more. Near the garden are always stationed\r\n    two small galleys; these are rowed by the gardeners when the\r\n    Signor goes on a pleasure-trip, and the _Boluk-bashi_ holds the\r\n    helm.[739]\r\n\r\n  The _Ashji-bashi_, chief cook, with fifty cooks under him. He\r\n    has 40 aspers per day, the cooks under him four, six, or eight\r\n    aspers each.\r\n\r\n  The _Helvaji-bashi_, or chief confectioner, with 40 aspers, and\r\n    he has thirty companions with five to six aspers per day each.\r\n\r\n  The _Chasnijir-bashi_,[740] chief of the cupboards, with eighty\r\n    aspers: morning and evening he brings with his own hand the\r\n    dish of the Signor, and he has under him a hundred _Chasnijirs_\r\n    with from three to seventy aspers each.[741]\r\n\r\n  The _Mutbakh-emini_,[742] or steward, with 40 aspers. He has a\r\n    secretary with 20 aspers a day.\r\n\r\n  A hundred _Ajem-oghlans_, who transport on carts the wood of\r\n    the palace. They have three to five aspers, and are provided\r\n    with clothing.\r\n\r\n  Ten _Sakkas_, who carry water on horseback in leathern sacks,\r\n    with three to five aspers each.\r\n\r\n  The expenses for the table of the Signor, and of the youths\r\n    with their eunuchs and others to about a thousand, amount to\r\n    five thousand aspers a day.\r\n\r\n  Three _Kapuji-bashis_, or captains of the gate, who have a\r\n    hundred aspers a day and are clothed every year: and they have\r\n    under them two hundred and fifty _Kapujis_, who have five to\r\n    six aspers each; and each _Kapuji-bashi_ with a third of the\r\n    _Kapujis_ is obliged to keep guard at the gate of the Signor,\r\n    changing from day to day. And when any ambassador or other\r\n    person goes to kiss the hand of the Grand Signor, all these are\r\n    given presents of clothes or of money according to the degree\r\n    of him who is introduced.\r\n\r\n  A _Kapuji-kiaya_, who is, as it were, a lieutenant of the\r\n    _Kapujis_, has forty aspers a day.\r\n\r\n  Four Vizier Pashas, or chief counsellors: the greatest has\r\n    ordinarily twenty-four thousand ducats a year and the others\r\n    sixteen to eighteen thousand; but they have also so much\r\n    feudal income that they receive three times as much as the\r\n    provision in money.[743] To this should be added the garments\r\n    which the Signor gives them, the presents of ambassadors and\r\n    of others, the perquisites of the office they hold, which\r\n    are unlimited. At present they are only three. The first\r\n    is Ibrahim, born a Christian at Parga. The second Aias of\r\n    Khimara. The third Kassim of Croatia, a kidnapped Christian.\r\n    To these there is added a fourth at present,[744] who is\r\n    Khaireddin Bey Barbarossa of the Albanian nation, formerly a\r\n    corsair and now king of Algiers in Barbary. These Pashas live\r\n    and dress very superbly. They have: Ibrahim six thousand and\r\n    more slaves, Aias two thousand, Kassim fifteen hundred, and\r\n    Barbarossa about four thousand. To all these slaves they give\r\n    pay, horses, garments, golden bonnets and silver chains,[745]\r\n    according to their offices and degrees. And these serve their\r\n    Pashas under the same arrangements by which the Signor is\r\n    served by his [slaves]. They have also twenty-five or thirty\r\n    chancery secretaries to the Signor, men of great repute, with\r\n    twenty-five to thirty aspers per day each: they keep more or\r\n    fewer slaves as they can. These Pashas have entry to the Signor\r\n    for affairs of state; and it is in fact they who govern the\r\n    whole after their own fashion.\r\n\r\n  There is next the _Mufti_, or the interpreter and chief of the\r\n    laws; they do not trouble him about anything except the affairs\r\n    of religion and their faith, and he has the position which our\r\n    Pope had in ancient times.[746]\r\n\r\n  Two _Kaziasker Danishmends_, or doctors of the laws for the\r\n    army, one for Greece, the other for Anatolia. Their position is\r\n    of great importance. They sit at the Porte and have precedence\r\n    of the Vizier Pashas: on this account they are much esteemed.\r\n    They are executors of the laws, and with the consent of the\r\n    Pashas they appoint and remove the _Kazis_, who are like\r\n    podestas for the whole country. They have feudal income of\r\n    about six thousand ducats a year each. They keep two hundred\r\n    to three hundred slaves each, and they are accompanied by ten\r\n    secretaries appointed by the Signor and two _Mochtur-bashis_,\r\n    who hold the office of ushers:[747] these live from\r\n    perquisites, of which they have a great many.\r\n\r\n  Two _Defterdars_, or treasurers, or rather, as we would say,\r\n    governors of the revenues. One of these has the receipt and the\r\n    care of those revenues which come from a third of Greece, or\r\n    from that part which is toward the Danube, and besides, from\r\n    Asia, from Syria, and from Egypt, with feudal income of ten\r\n    thousand ducats a year, although with the perquisites he gets\r\n    twice as much. The other has the care of the other two-thirds\r\n    of Greece: but when the Signor takes the field this man remains\r\n    in Constantinople as his vicar and lieutenant; and he has six\r\n    thousand ducats of feudal income, but gets three times as much;\r\n    and their position is of great dignity. They have under them\r\n    fifty clerks with many helpers: these keep the accounts of the\r\n    _Khazineh_, or treasury of the Signor; and these clerks are\r\n    appointed by the Signor with pay of fifteen to fifty aspers per\r\n    day each. The _Defterdars_ have, the first a thousand slaves\r\n    and the second five hundred, and the clerks from two to twenty\r\n    slaves each.[748]\r\n\r\n  Two _Rusnamehjis_, chief clerks, who receive the money and\r\n    disburse it as needed, with twenty-five companions besides\r\n    themselves.\r\n\r\n  The two have forty aspers each, and the twenty-five have eight\r\n    to ten aspers a day.\r\n\r\n  Two _Veznedars_, or weighers of aspers and ducats, with\r\n    twenty-five to thirty aspers each.\r\n\r\n  Six _Sarrafs_, or bankers, who know gold and silver [coins],\r\n    and they have ten to fifteen aspers each.\r\n\r\n  One _Nishanji-bashi_, who signs the ordinances and public\r\n    writings with the monogram of the Signor. His position is like\r\n    that of grand chancellor and is of great repute. He sits at the\r\n    Porte below the _Beylerbeys_. He has eight thousand ducats of\r\n    feudal income, and travels in great honor with more than three\r\n    hundred slaves.\r\n\r\n  An outside _Khazinehdar-bashi_, or household treasurer, with\r\n    ten _Khazinehdars_ under him. He has fifty aspers, and they ten\r\n    to fifteen per day.\r\n\r\n  A _Defter-emini_, who has charge of the feudal grants: he keeps\r\n    the register of those who receive feudal grants. He has forty\r\n    aspers a day, and under him are ten clerks with ten to fifteen\r\n    aspers per day each.\r\n\r\n  Eighty _Muteferrika_, or lancers of the body-guard[749] of the\r\n    Signor, these always carry lances when he takes the field; they\r\n    recognize no other head than the Signor himself. And when by\r\n    artifice or merit they acquire favor, they are made _Aghas_, or\r\n    generals. The least has ten, the greatest eighty, aspers per\r\n    day.\r\n\r\n  A _Chaush-bashi_, or chief sergeant of the army. He is of so\r\n    great credit with every one, that when he is sent by the Signor\r\n    to some Pasha, _Sanjak_, or _Kazi_, with the order to have\r\n    the head of such and such a one cut off, he is obeyed without\r\n    their requiring a letter from him, or a command in writing;\r\n    not otherwise than if the Signor himself were there, and gave\r\n    command. He has a hundred aspers a day, and under him he keeps\r\n    a hundred slaves,[750] with twenty-five to forty aspers each.\r\n\r\n  The _Mihter-bashi_, or chief of those who pitch the tents and\r\n    spread the rugs, who sweep the court-yards and attend to other\r\n    similar duties; he has forty aspers, a _Kiaya_ with twenty-five\r\n    aspers, sixty _Mihters_ with five to eight aspers each; and\r\n    they are clothed every year by the Signor.\r\n\r\n  An _Agha_, or general of the Janissaries. He has for pay a\r\n    thousand aspers and over per day, and six thousand ducats of\r\n    feudal grant per year. When this _Agha_ holds court, which\r\n    is two or three times per week, he is obliged to give the\r\n    Janissaries to eat, a meal of bread, rice, mutton, honey,\r\n    and water. He has under him a _Kiaya_ or Secretary of the\r\n    Janissaries, who is, as it were, a vicegerent; he has two\r\n    hundred aspers per day of pay in cash, and thirty thousand\r\n    of feudal grant per year.[751] And there is a clerk of these\r\n    Janissaries, called the _Yaziji_ of the Janissaries,[752] with\r\n    a hundred aspers a day.\r\n\r\n  A _Seymen-bashi_, chief of the harriers.[753] He has a hundred\r\n    aspers and has from the number of the Janissaries about two\r\n    thousand under him.\r\n\r\n  A _Zagarji-bashi_, head of the hounds.[754] He has fifty aspers\r\n    a day, and has under him about seven hundred of the Janissaries.\r\n\r\n  The Janissaries number about twelve thousand: they have each\r\n    from three to eight aspers of pay per day. Each ten has its\r\n    _Oda-bashi_, and each hundred has its _Boluk-bashi_. And\r\n    these heads of ten or of a hundred go on horseback. And the\r\n    _Oda-bashis_ have forty, and the _Boluk-bashis_ sixty aspers\r\n    a day. The remainder of the Janissaries go on foot. They are\r\n    clothed once a year by the Signor with coarse blue cloth.\r\n    They have their residence in two barracks in Constantinople\r\n    given by the Signor. Those who have no wives reside in these.\r\n    Those who are married reside at various places in the city.\r\n    For their living expenses each contributes so much a day, and\r\n    they have a steward and a cook, who provide their necessary\r\n    living: and those who have less pay than the others are obliged\r\n    to serve those who have more pay than they. Every hundred of\r\n    them when they take the field transport a tent. They go on\r\n    foot, and part of them are musketeers, and part halbardiers,\r\n    and part use the scimetar alone. Every three lead a horse\r\n    which carries their clothing. And when they come to old age,\r\n    or when for some other reason the service of one of them does\r\n    not please the Signor, they are stricken from the book of the\r\n    Janissaries, and are sent as _Hissarlis_[755] or castle guards;\r\n    and those of their officers who are deposed for such a reason,\r\n    are sent as castellans with a feudal grant equivalent to the\r\n    pay which they had previously, in such a way that none of\r\n    them suffers hardship. Such of them as succeed in war are made\r\n    _Voivodes_,[756] and raised to high positions. They come as\r\n    boys to this soldiery and are taught by the experienced ones.\r\n    They choose healthy ones, well-built, but nimble and dextrous,\r\n    lively above all, and more often cruel than compassionate.\r\n    In them rests the force and all the firmness of the army of\r\n    the Turk; they, because they are always exercising and living\r\n    together, all become as it were a single body, and of a truth\r\n    they are terrible.[757]\r\n\r\n  From the Janissaries are chosen a hundred and fifty _Solaks_,\r\n    who are footmen of the Signor, with fifteen to twenty aspers a\r\n    day each: they march surrounding the person of the Signor every\r\n    time he goes forth.\r\n\r\n  Two _Solak-bashis_, chief officers of the _Solaks_, who go\r\n    on horseback, with thirty aspers per day. And these and the\r\n    _Solaks_ are in obedience to the _Agha_ of the Janissaries.\r\n\r\n  An _Agha_ of the _Spahi-oghlans_, an office of great honor.\r\n    He has from feudal grant and pay ten ducats a day, and he\r\n    has a large number of slaves, with a _Kiaya_ under him, or\r\n    lieutenant: this man has from feudal grant and pay a hundred\r\n    aspers a day. And also a _Yaziji_, or secretary, with thirty\r\n    aspers, and with large perquisites.\r\n\r\n  The _Spahi-oghlans_, or youths on horseback, who may be\r\n    called _Spahi-oghlan_, are more than three thousand; and they\r\n    have twenty to forty aspers each; and every twenty have a\r\n    _Boluk-bashi_. These serve on horseback, each with five or six\r\n    slaves and a like number of horses. And they always journey,\r\n    and also encamp, at the right hand of the Signor. They are\r\n    great people. From them the Signor is wont to choose his chief\r\n    men. They are first put as boys into the palace, and when they\r\n    grow up they succeed well if they attain this grade: it is like\r\n    a ladder to mount to higher positions.\r\n\r\n  An _Agha_ of the _Silihdars_, who has thirty thousand aspers\r\n    a day,[758] and under him a lieutenant, a secretary, a\r\n    _Kiaya_,[759] with thirty aspers and more each.\r\n\r\n  There are three thousand _Silihdars_. They moreover ride and\r\n    encamp at the left hand of the Signor. They have twenty to\r\n    twenty-five aspers per day each, and they have four or five\r\n    slaves and a like number of horses, with feudal income for\r\n    their living. They are trained by the same education with\r\n    which the _Spahis_ are brought up: nor is there any difference\r\n    between them, except that the _Spahis_ go on the right, and\r\n    these on the left, of the Signor.\r\n\r\n  Two _Ulufaji-bashis_, or chief officers of soldiers, with\r\n    two thousand _Ulufajis_, who go on the right hand and the\r\n    left of the Signor. The chief officers have a hundred and\r\n    twenty aspers, and the others eight to sixteen aspers; then\r\n    under them[760] they have a _Kiaya_, a secretary, and a\r\n    lieutenant,[761] with slaves and with horses, some more and\r\n    some fewer.\r\n\r\n  Two _Aghas_, chief officers of the _Ghureba-oghlans_, or poor\r\n    youths[762] with eighty aspers each. _Kiayas_, thirty aspers.\r\n    Secretaries, twenty-five. And they have under them about two\r\n    thousand _Ghureba-oghlans_ with seven to fourteen aspers per\r\n    day: these have slaves and horses.\r\n\r\n  Two _Emir-al-Akhors_,[763] or masters of the stable, a greater\r\n    and a lesser. The greater has five hundred aspers, the lesser\r\n    two hundred, with lieutenant and _Kiaya_[764] and others, who\r\n    have thirty to forty aspers each.\r\n\r\n  Sixteen thousand altogether of _Serraj_, who have charge\r\n    of bridles[765] and saddles; _Ceyssi_, or stable servants;\r\n    _Carmandari_, who take care of the mules; _Deveji_, who take\r\n    care of the camels, and _Cavriliji_, who herd the cattle and\r\n    horses in various places. These have two to twenty aspers per\r\n    day each.\r\n\r\n  Thirty to forty _Peiks_, or runners on foot, men who when boys\r\n    have had their spleens removed:[766] and they run post on foot\r\n    with great speed. These when the Signor goes forth remain\r\n    continually near, so that he may employ them according to his\r\n    needs.\r\n\r\n  Select horses about four thousand for the person of the Signor;\r\n    on these the pages of the palace and the eunuchs ride for\r\n    exercise in their turns.\r\n\r\n  A _Chakirji-bashi_, chief Vulturer, and a _Shahinji-bashi_,\r\n    chief Falconer. The first has a hundred and fifty aspers, and\r\n    the other has eighty; with _Kiayas_, lieutenants,[767] and\r\n    others, with ten to twenty-five aspers each per day. Under\r\n    these are about two hundred _Zanijiler_,[768] only a hundred of\r\n    whom have ten aspers a day, and the others have feudal income,\r\n    or exemption from taxation. And they take the field when the\r\n    Signor has need.\r\n\r\n  A _Jebeji-bashi_, chief armorer. He has sixty aspers, a _Kiaya_\r\n    and a secretary with twenty aspers each. He has under him about\r\n    one thousand five hundred _jebejis_, with seven to twelve\r\n    aspers. These all go on foot when the Signor takes the field.\r\n\r\n  A _Topji-bashi_, chief of artillery. He has seventy aspers, a\r\n    _Kiaya_ [and] secretary with twenty aspers: and under him are\r\n    two thousand _Topjis_ with six to ten aspers, and they go on\r\n    foot.\r\n\r\n  An _Arabaji-bashi_, chief wagoner. He has forty aspers, a\r\n    _Kiaya_ [and] secretary with twenty aspers: and under him three\r\n    thousand _Arabajis_ with three to six aspers each.\r\n\r\n  A _Mihter-bashi_, or chief of trumpeters and drummers. He has\r\n    thirty [aspers] per day, and under him two hundred _Mihters_,\r\n    part of them on foot and part on horseback with three to five\r\n    aspers per day.\r\n\r\n  An _Emir-Alem Agha_, who carries the standard of the Signor.\r\n    He has two hundred aspers a day, and is captain of all the\r\n    musicians.\r\n\r\n  An _Arpa-emini_, who is Provider of the grain, with a\r\n    Lieutenant and a Chancellor.[769] He has sixty aspers, the\r\n    Lieutenant thirty and the Chancellor twenty: this _Arpa-emini_\r\n    has under him twenty persons who receive among them all about\r\n    eight hundred aspers.\r\n\r\n  A _Shehr-emini_,[770] or Commissioner of public works, who\r\n    takes care of the streets of Constantinople, and also of the\r\n    road when the Signor goes forth to war: and he has charge also\r\n    of public buildings, fountains, and aqueducts. He has fifty\r\n    aspers, and keeps under him four hundred men: among all of\r\n    these is given a thousand aspers. He has also a _Kiaya_ and\r\n    secretary with about thirty-eight aspers each.[771]\r\n\r\n  A _Berat-emini_, who is deputed to distribute the ordinances\r\n    of the Signor in writing and who receives the fees; and he has\r\n    forty aspers, with two secretaries, and two superintendents\r\n    with twenty aspers each.\r\n\r\n  A _Terjuman_,[772] or interpreter of all the languages. This\r\n    position is highly reputed in proportion to the worth and\r\n    intelligence of him who holds it. He has five hundred ducats\r\n    of fixed income each year, and has also a like sum from feudal\r\n    grant, and more than four times as much of extraordinary\r\n    income; and he is wont to be highly respected.\r\n\r\n  Proceeding now further as I have begun, I shall leave it for\r\n    another time and eye to reduce this Porte to better order and\r\n    put everything in its proper place. I find that to all the\r\n    above-mentioned things should be added a PALACE of the ladies\r\n    of the Signor.[773] This is very large, with a circuit of about\r\n    a mile and a half; and it is provided with different chambers\r\n    and other rooms, where the sons of the Signor reside separately\r\n    with their mothers, and with a great number of eunuchs for\r\n    their guard and service. There also reside the Sultanas, that\r\n    is the mothers and the wives of the Signors; and there are\r\n    three hundred damsels, placed there virgins, and given to the\r\n    government of many matrons. To all of these damsels the Signor\r\n    has it taught to embroider different designs, to each he gives\r\n    pay of ten to twenty aspers per day; and twice every year at\r\n    the two Bairams he has them clothed in stuffs of silk. And\r\n    when one of these pleases him he does what he wishes with her,\r\n    and when he has lain with her he gives her a golden bonnet\r\n    and ten thousand aspers, and has her placed in a separate\r\n    apartment from the others, increasing her ordinary pay.[774]\r\n    In the aforesaid Palace there is an _Agha_ of the Eunuchs:\r\n    to these are given a hundred and twenty aspers for all.\r\n    Three _Kapuji-bashis_, and with them a hundred _Kapujis_ and\r\n    Janissaries at the gate: among all these is given six hundred\r\n    aspers a day. Ten _Sakkas_, who carry water, forty aspers in\r\n    all. And the damsels are served and educated up to the age of\r\n    twenty-five years. The teachers are the matrons, the servants\r\n    are the youngest among them; and when they have arrived at\r\n    twenty-five years, if it does not please the Signor to keep\r\n    them for his own use, he marries them to _Spahi-oghlans_,\r\n    and to others of the slaves of the Porte according to the\r\n    degree and condition of both parties; and in their place he\r\n    substitutes others.\r\n\r\n  There is also a palace near Pera for about four hundred boys,\r\n    who have pay of six to ten aspers, and are clothed with silk\r\n    twice a year. These have an _Agha_ and eunuchs, as have\r\n    those in the great palace, [and] _Kapujis_, _Ajem-oghlans_\r\n    and a hundred teachers of various arts. Among all these is\r\n    distributed eight hundred aspers a day. They are not so\r\n    noble, or of so beautiful appearance or show of intelligence\r\n    as are those who reside with the Signor; but from these also\r\n    many become great, and some of them are taken into the great\r\n    palace. And similarly in Adrianople there is a palace of\r\n    three hundred boys under pay, an _Agha_, eunuchs, _Kapujis_,\r\n    Janissaries, and teachers, about two hundred in all, who have\r\n    all together two thousand eight hundred aspers a day. These are\r\n    of third grade, but they are carefully taught and well kept\r\n    like all the others, and from them according to the spirit\r\n    and worth which they show promotions are made. There is also\r\n    in that region another palace, recently built, with a large\r\n    and beautiful garden: this is located on the river Maritza,\r\n    and in it reside about three hundred _Ajem-oghlans_; on these\r\n    [palaces] they spend every year two hundred thousand aspers\r\n    for each, and they have an _Agha_ with forty aspers and a\r\n    lieutenant and secretaries with thirty aspers each per day. In\r\n    various other places in Adrianople there are gardens: in these\r\n    reside continually as on deposit one thousand five hundred\r\n    _Ajem-oghlans_ with _Agha_ and secretaries, and on these they\r\n    spend six thousand aspers a year[775] or a little more.\r\n\r\n  There is also an _Agha_ of the _Ajem-oghlans_, or Janissary\r\n    recruits, who resides in Constantinople; he has sixty aspers\r\n    per day, and under him are about five thousand _Ajem-oghlans_:\r\n    these they clothe twice a year, and on their teachers and\r\n    chiefs they spend ten thousand aspers[776] a year. They put\r\n    them on ships and buildings to carry wood and perform other\r\n    tasks. They become cooks or servants of the Janissaries, and\r\n    finally they become Janissaries.\r\n\r\n  And every four years the Turkish Signor sends into Greece and\r\n    into Anatolia to seize boys, sons of Christians, ten or twelve\r\n    thousand each time: these he sends into Anatolia in the region\r\n    of Brusa or Caramania to dig the earth, so that they will\r\n    become accustomed to hard labor, and so that there they may\r\n    learn the Turkish language. These boys remain in such a place\r\n    and occupation three or four years: then they are ordered to be\r\n    gathered again, and are given to the government and discipline\r\n    of the _Agha_ of the _Ajem-oghlans_. For these the Signor does\r\n    not have any expenses so long as they reside in Anatolia,\r\n    because they are clothed and have their living from those whom\r\n    they serve by plowing the ground and doing other work for them.\r\n\r\nIt seemed best to me to make mention in this place of all the palaces,\r\nbecause they are as it were of the same body as that of the Signor, and\r\nall the expenses of these are computed in the book of the expense of\r\nthe great palace, or that of the Signor. To these expenses are added\r\nthose, which are incurred in clothing twice each year the Pashas, the\r\n_Kaziaskers_, the _Defterdars_, the _Beylerbeys_, and the _Nishanji_, and\r\nthe expenses which are incurred for the extraordinary presents of the\r\nSignor. These in all amount to and go beyond a million aspers a year.\r\n\r\n  There is also an Arsenal in the region of Pera, small and of\r\n    short circuit: this has on the sea-front ninety-two vaults, and\r\n    so little area and ground within that not merely no galleys\r\n    but not even materials and timbers can be contained there. In\r\n    it usually work each day about two hundred men; although there\r\n    are under pay two hundred patrons with two thousand aspers per\r\n    day for all.[777] A thousand _Azabs_, who have among them four\r\n    thousand aspers. Foremen, or masters fifty in number, who have\r\n    in leisure, that is, when not working, six aspers, and when\r\n    working, twelve aspers each. An Intendant, forty aspers. A\r\n    Secretary, twenty-five aspers, with ten clerks under him, who\r\n    have a hundred aspers. All these fulfil their duties when there\r\n    is great need; but they understand ill the trade and art of\r\n    building galleys. For this reason they do not turn out good and\r\n    ready ones like ours; and what few there are are overseen by\r\n    Christians, who are well paid.\r\n\r\n  Over this Arsenal and all these persons, there is one who\r\n    is called the _Beylerbey_ of the sea; that is to say, Lord\r\n    of lords, an office created at the time when I was in\r\n    Constantinople; since in the past he who was _Sanjak_ of\r\n    Gallipoli was wont to be called Captain of the Sea. And\r\n    Khaireddin Bey called Barbarossa was the first who had this\r\n    title; he was then made fourth Pasha. To him is given the\r\n    government of all the fleets, and he has for income every year\r\n    a feudal grant of fourteen thousand ducats, besides that from\r\n    Rhodes, Euboea, and Mytilene; so that he receives twice as much\r\n    more.\r\n\r\nI find nothing else that pertains to arrangements for the rule and watch\r\nof the sea which are worthy of note: wherefore I will now come to those\r\nof the land; these are in truth well and usefully ordered.\r\n\r\n  There is first one called the _Beylerbey_ of Greece: in this\r\n    are included all the lands which the Turkish Signor possesses\r\n    in Europe: this _Beylerbey_ is greater than all the others.\r\n    He has from feudal grant sixteen thousand ducats a year, and\r\n    gets more than double this. He sits at the Porte after the\r\n    Pashas,[778] and is of great repute with everybody. He has\r\n    under him besides his slaves, who number more than a thousand,\r\n    a _Defterdar_ with feudal income of three thousand ducats a\r\n    year; a hundred clerks who keep the books and accounts of the\r\n    feudal grants assigned to _Subashis_, _Kazis_, _Spahis_, and\r\n    others; among all of whom are distributed ten thousand ducats a\r\n    year.\r\n\r\n  Thirty-six _Sanjaks_: these are in obedience to him, and have\r\n    for feudal income from five to twelve thousand ducats a year\r\n    each. They are distributed through the provinces: in these they\r\n    reside only so long as pleases the Signor: he changes them, as\r\n    seems best to him, from one province to another. Their duty is\r\n    to rule the _Spahis_, and to have them trained in arms, and to\r\n    keep them in obedience.\r\n\r\n      Four hundred _Subashis_, who have among them all from feudal\r\n    income four hundred thousand ducats, and have about five\r\n    hundred slaves each.[779]\r\n\r\n      Thirty thousand _Spahis_: these are horse soldiery set apart\r\n    some to the service of the _Beylerbey_, and some to that of\r\n    all the _Sanjaks_ of Greece. They have from feudal grant two\r\n    hundred ducats each, and each of them, for every hundred ducats\r\n    of feudal income, is obliged to maintain an armed man, with\r\n    horse and lance. And then they have besides the armed man two\r\n    or four or five servants and horses. These _Spahis_ are all\r\n    slaves of the Signor, and sons of slaves, and of _Spahis_.\r\n\r\n      Twenty thousand _Timarjis_ who have ten to forty ducats of\r\n    feudal income each year, and because they do not reach a\r\n    hundred ducats, they are not called _Spahis_. These have each\r\n    a horse and two or three servants, and they serve distributed\r\n    through all the _Sanjaks_ of Greece. The feudal grants are by\r\n    assignment of land; the income of this assignment they get\r\n    partly from rent, but the greater part from the tithes of all\r\n    the income, which Turks as well as Christians pay, and from the\r\n    poll-tax, which is twenty-five aspers per head from Christians\r\n    alone, and from the imposts laid on animals, fruit-trees, and\r\n    other things. These imposts, moreover, are in addition to those\r\n    which they pay ordinarily to the Signor.\r\n\r\n      Sixty thousand _Akinji_, or mounted adventurers, inscribed for\r\n    the lands of Greece and obliged to go to war without payment.\r\n    But they are exempt from any burden, and cities and villages\r\n    are bound to give them, when they pass through, living expenses\r\n    only.\r\n\r\n  There are in all Greece, that is, in all the countries which\r\n    the Turkish Signor possesses in Europe, sixty-eight thousand\r\n    villages of Turkish and Christian people, subject to public\r\n    burdens.[780]\r\n\r\n  There follow next six _Beylerbeys_ of Asia, and a separate\r\n    one of Egypt. The first of these is called the _Beylerbey_ of\r\n    Anatolia which was anciently Asia Minor: he has from feudal\r\n    income fourteen thousand ducats, but gets a great deal more.\r\n    This man has under him and in his government Pontus, Bithynia,\r\n    Asia proper, Lydia, Caria, and Lycia: these provinces under a\r\n    single name are called at present Anatolia. This man’s place at\r\n    the Porte is after the _Beylerbey_ of Greece. And he has under\r\n    him, besides his own slaves, who are more than a thousand,\r\n    twelve _Sanjaks_ with feudal income of from four to six\r\n    thousand ducats each. Ten thousand _Spahis_, with five to ten\r\n    aspers a day, and also more or less feudal income according to\r\n    their degree. Next after these follows\r\n\r\n  The _Beylerbey_ of Caramania, which was anciently Cilicia and\r\n    Pamphylia, with feudal income of ten thousand ducats. This man\r\n    has under him seven _Sanjaks_ with four to six thousand ducats\r\n    of feudal income each, and five thousand _Spahis_, with five to\r\n    ten aspers a day each and feudal income besides.\r\n\r\n  The _Beylerbey_ of Amasia and Tokat, which was Cappadocia and\r\n    Galatia, with feudal income of eight thousand ducats. Four\r\n    _Sanjaks_ with four to six thousand ducats of feudal income\r\n    each. Four thousand _Spahis_ with five to ten aspers a day each\r\n    and feudal income.\r\n\r\n  The _Beylerbey_ of Anadole, which is a region between Syria,\r\n    Caramania, and Tokat, which was anciently Paphlagonia, and\r\n    is the half of Armenia Minor. He has ten thousand ducats of\r\n    feudal income, and under him seven _Sanjaks_ with four to five\r\n    thousand ducats of feudal income. Seven thousand _Spahis_, with\r\n    five to ten aspers per day and feudal income. In this province\r\n    of Anadole, they say that when the Signor is there, besides the\r\n    paid troops thirty thousand persons are obliged to ride without\r\n    any pay, but only with expenses from the villages.\r\n\r\n  The _Beylerbey_ of Mesopotamia, under whom is the remainder of\r\n    Armenia Minor and part of the Major, the other parts belonging\r\n    to the Persians and the Kurds. This borders with Bagdad, or\r\n    Baldach, which was anciently Babylonia. He has of feudal income\r\n    thirty thousand ducats: and besides his own slaves, who number\r\n    two thousand, he has under him twelve _Sanjaks_ with feudal\r\n    income of four to six thousand ducats a year, and ten[781]\r\n    _Spahis_ with ten to fifteen aspers per day each, and with\r\n    large feudal income because of being at the confines of the\r\n    Persians: with these they are continually in conflict.\r\n\r\n  A _Beylerbey_ of Damascus and Syria and Judea, with feudal\r\n    income of twenty-four thousand ducats; he has more than two\r\n    thousand slaves, and under him twelve _Sanjaks_ with feudal\r\n    income of five to seven thousand ducats, and twenty thousand\r\n    _Spahis_ with ten to fifteen aspers per day each and with good\r\n    feudal income.\r\n\r\n  A _Beylerbey_ of Cairo: he holds jurisdiction as far as Mecca,\r\n    or as far as into Arabia: this Arabia is possessed by the\r\n    Turkish Signor in the way in which he possesses Albania, where\r\n    he is not yielded such obedience as he is accustomed to receive\r\n    from all his other states and countries. But [Arabia] Felix\r\n    stands in somewhat greater obedience than the rest. He has for\r\n    feudal income thirty thousand ducats, with numerous slaves:\r\n    these amount to more than four thousand; sixteen _Sanjaks_ with\r\n    feudal income of six to eight thousand ducats each; and sixteen\r\n    thousand _Spahis_ with fifteen to twenty aspers each per day.\r\n\r\n  Near Mecca, and the countries of the Persians, are some Arabic\r\n    lords who do not obey any one. The rest[782] then borders\r\n    the Persians as far as Mesopotamia, in which is Bagdad.[783]\r\n    Passing Mesopotamia it borders the Persians again to the plain\r\n    of Naximan, then touches Erzinjan[784] and Erzerum, which are\r\n    the chief places of Armenia Major. This Armenia borders with\r\n    the Iberians and Georgians. In these Armenias, Major and Minor,\r\n    are many Kurds, people of the mountains and warlike, those of\r\n    [Armenia] Major obedient partly to the Turkish Signor, and\r\n    partly to the Persian; those of [Armenia] Minor to no one.\r\n    Next Trebizond borders with the Georgians and Mingrelians,\r\n    and with part of the Iberians, which people were anciently\r\n    called Colchians. And Ajemia,[785] which anciently was Assyria,\r\n    belongs to the Persian: he is absolute master of it.\r\n\r\n  There are in all Anatolia, or in all the countries which\r\n    the Turkish Signor possesses in Asia, villages of Turks and\r\n    Christians to the number of more than seventy-two thousand, not\r\n    counting those which are in Egypt, which are many.\r\n\r\n  The _Sanjaks_ truly [set forth]: these (as I said above)\r\n    have under government the provinces entrusted to the\r\n    _Beylerbeys_; they are men of much and very great reputation\r\n    and esteem, especially in the affairs of war; they are named\r\n    as below by the names of the places which are given to their\r\n    government. And first the _Beylerbey_ of Greece holds as his\r\n    sanjakate the places about Salonika. Then follow the others\r\n    of Kaffa, Silistria, Nicopolis, Vidin, Semendria, Servia and\r\n    Belgrade,[786] Zvornick, Bosnia, Hersek, which is the Servia\r\n    called the Duchy,[787] Scutari, Avlona, Yanina, Karli Ili,\r\n    Lepanto, Morea, Negropont, Trikkala, Gallipoli, Kirk-Kilisse or\r\n    Forty Churches, Viza, Chirmen, Kostendil, Vishidrina, Prisrend,\r\n    Okhrida, Alaja Hissar, Elbassan, Voinuch, Chiuchene, Zaiza.\r\n    These are usually counted thirty-five, but five are regions\r\n    united to neighboring places, namely Philippopolis, Sofia,\r\n    Durazzo, Albania, and Uskup.\r\n\r\n  ANATOLIA, or Asia Minor: Pontus, Bithynia, Lydia, Caria, and\r\n    Lycia. The sanjakate of the _Beylerbey_ is at Kutaia. And the\r\n    others are in Hoja-ili, Boli, Kastamuni, Angora, Kanghri,[788]\r\n    Tekke-ili, Menteshe-ili, Aidin-ili, Alayeh,[789] Bigha, and\r\n    Manissa,[790] which is that of Sultan Mustapha, the oldest son\r\n    of the Signor. This place is opposite the middle of Chios near\r\n    the sea.\r\n\r\n  AMASIA, and Tokat, which is Paphlagonia, Galatia, and\r\n    Cappadocia. The sanjakate of the _Beylerbey_ is in Amasia, of\r\n    the others in Chorum, Janik, Kara-hissar, Samsun, Trebizond.\r\n\r\n  CARAMANIA, which is Cilicia opposite Cyprus and Pamphylia.\r\n    The sanjakate of the _Beylerbey_ is in Konia. The others\r\n    have theirs in Naranda, Hissar, Eski-hissar, Versag-ili,\r\n    Sivri-hissar.\r\n\r\n  ANADOLE, or Armenia Minor. The sanjakate of the _Beylerbey_\r\n    is in Marash. Those of the others in Sarmussacli,\r\n    Albistan-ovassi,[791] Adana, Tarsus.\r\n\r\n  DIARBEKIR, or Mesopotamia, and part of Armenia Major, of which\r\n    the remainder belongs to the Persians and the Kurds. The\r\n    sanjakate of the _Beylerbey_ is in Diarbekir. And the others\r\n    have theirs in Kara Amid, Arghana, Toljik, Hassan-Kief, Mardin,\r\n    Kharput, Mosul, Erzerum, Baiburt, Bitlis, and Naximan-ovassi.\r\n\r\n  SYRIA, and Judea. The sanjakate of the _Beylerbey_ is in\r\n    Damascus. Of the others in Malatia, Divirigi, Aintab, Antioch,\r\n    Aleppo, Tripoli, Hama, Homs, Safita, Jerusalem, Gaza.\r\n\r\n  EGYPT, with part of Arabia Deserta as far as Jeddah;[792]\r\n    Mecca, with all of Arabia Felix, where are many Arab lordlings,\r\n    who are partly in devotion to the Turkish Signor, partly to no\r\n    one. The sanjakate of the _Beylerbey_ is in Cairo, and of the\r\n    others....[793]\r\n\r\n  All the aforesaid _Sanjaks_, _Beylerbeys_, Pashas, and other\r\n    officials have salary or feudal income, as I have said above,\r\n    by fixed arrangement, that is, regularly: but they obtain from\r\n    extraordinary sources about as much more. And they live with\r\n    very great expenses for slaves: these they are accustomed to\r\n    clothe and they give them also wages besides, so that they will\r\n    not steal.\r\n\r\nHow great the revenues of this Signor are, may be estimated from the\r\nexpenses. These revenues are obtained from the Kharâj, which is paid by\r\nthe non-Turkish subjects; this gives a million and a half ducats: from\r\nthe tax on animals, which gives eight hundred thousand ducats: from\r\nmines, which give six hundred thousand ducats: from countless other\r\nduties, salt-taxes, commendations, inheritances, gifts, the revenues of\r\nEgypt over and above the expenses, rents, and tributes. And they are so\r\ngreat that they not only meet the expenses, which amount besides the\r\nfeudal income in ready money drawn from the Treasury to more than twelve\r\nthousand ducats a day;[794] but there remains over a great sum of money\r\nfrom the surplus of each year. And it is believed that all the revenues\r\namount to fifteen millions in gold: five of which enter the Treasury, and\r\nthe other ten remain for the servants of war.[795]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX II\r\n\r\nPAMPHLET OF JUNIS BEY AND ALVISE GRITTI\r\n\r\nPrinted in 1537.

Thus the founding of the Mogul Empire nearly\r\ncoincided with the meridian splendor of the Ottoman power, and its\r\ndecisive battle of establishment with the victory which led to the last\r\ngreat extension of Ottoman authority into Europe. Not Baber or even\r\nAkbar, Suleiman’s contemporaries, but Aurangzeb, whose reign began a\r\ncentury after Suleiman’s death, affords the closest comparison with\r\nthe Turkish monarch; yet the third battle of Panipat in 1761 marked\r\nthe virtual destruction of the Mogul Empire, whereas the second battle\r\nof Mohacs in 1687 meant but the first noteworthy step of the Ottoman\r\nretreat. The house of Timur has disappeared from history, while the house\r\nof Osman still reigns over wide territories; less than two and a half\r\ncenturies of genuine sovereign rule were enjoyed by the Moguls, while six\r\ncenturies have not sufficed to measure the independent existence of the\r\nOttomans.\r\n\r\nThe Mogul emperors perhaps never ruled so large a territory as the\r\nOttoman sultans, but their lands were far more productive; moreover,\r\nhaving from five to ten times as many subjects as their Western cousins\r\nand an income in proportion, they could surpass even the Magnificent\r\nSuleiman in display and largesse. The inferior persistence of their\r\ndominion, therefore, suggests inferior strength and stability in their\r\ninstitutions, a suggestion to which even a limited investigation lends\r\nmuch support.\r\n\r\nThe Moguls shared with the Ottomans their relation to the ideas of the\r\nMongol and Turkish Tatars of the steppe lands, and to those of the\r\nPersians and the Arabs. They were more directly and vitally influenced\r\nby the Tatars and Persians, and less directly by the Arabs. Farther\r\nthan this their relations were not to the comparatively organized and\r\nenergetic civilization of the Mediterranean but to the more speculative\r\nand passive culture of India. Over the lands into which they entered as\r\nconquerors lay the shadow not of sternly practical Roman legalism, but of\r\nHindu and Buddhist contempt for things mundane.\r\n\r\nThey founded a despotism, but one that was never, even under Aurangzeb,\r\nso closely related to the Sacred Law of Mohammed as was the government of\r\nSuleiman. They ruled a variety of lands in a variety of relationships,\r\nbut never with the stern control exercised by the _Kaisar-i-Rûm_\r\n(Roman emperor), the name which they gave to the Turkish ruler at\r\nConstantinople. They enforced the obedience of many peoples, who spoke\r\nmany languages and practised many forms of religion; yet they never held\r\nthese peoples under any such iron system of subjection as that which\r\ndominated the Christian subjects of the sultan, even to the seizure of\r\ntheir children for tribute.\r\n\r\nSince the passing of those prehistoric times when all human ideas were\r\nsolidified together into a single “crust of custom,” every nation\r\nhas probably had two leading institutions, more or less closely\r\nconnected,—the one of religion and the other of government. The foregoing\r\npages have shown how powerful and pervasive were the Ottoman Ruling\r\nInstitution and the Moslem Institution in the Ottoman Empire. In the\r\nparallel organizations of the empire of the Moguls, however, it is\r\nnot possible to discern comparable unique individuality, systematic\r\nstructure, and ordered efficiency. Some allowance must be made for a\r\ncomparative lack of information, since not many Western observers have\r\ndescribed the more distant empire; but this fact can hardly alter the\r\nconclusion materially. The institutional structure of the Mogul Empire\r\nwas decidedly inferior to that of the Ottoman Empire in solidity, system,\r\nand persistent energy.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PERSONNEL OF THE MOGUL GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nBaber’s following consisted of the comrades of his many years of\r\nfighting, an army of cavalry, artillery, and musketry composed in\r\nancient Turkish fashion of high-spirited men attached to their chief by\r\nimpressive leadership and open-handed generosity. Courage, military\r\nprowess, and the nominal profession of Islam were the necessary\r\nqualifications; differences of race, education, and Moslem doctrine\r\nwere disregarded. Warriors of Turki stock, Persians of Shiite leanings,\r\nhardy Afghans, “Roman” artillery engineers from Stambul, were equals in\r\nthe rough brotherhood of Baber’s camp. The principle of subordination,\r\nat least among persons of consequence, was not that of slaves to their\r\nmaster, but of tribesmen to their chief, of vassals to their honored\r\nsuzerain.\r\n\r\nWhen Turks had first invaded India, five centuries before, slavery as\r\na means of recruiting and training soldiers and governors was in full\r\nswing. Mahmûd of Ghazni was the son of a father who had risen through\r\nslavery. The thirteenth century saw enthroned at Delhi a dynasty of slave\r\nkings which antedated by several decades the Mamelukes of Egypt. Late in\r\nthe fourteenth century Firoz III owned 180,000 slaves, of whom 40,000\r\nconstituted his household. The Mameluke government endured for more\r\nthan two and a half centuries, until overthrown by the more centralized\r\nand efficient slave system of the Ottomans; but in Central Asia and\r\nultimately in India a new force speedily rendered the slave method, save\r\nfor some survivals, antiquated and impossible.\r\n\r\nThe dominance of the Mongols was based on the discipline of an army\r\nof freemen who were intelligent enough willingly to render absolute\r\nobedience to their officers as the well-tested condition of certain\r\nsuccess. With the break-up of the vast Mongol Empire, the lands now in\r\nRussian Central Asia, Afghanistan, and Persia lapsed toward the horde\r\norganization of nomad Tatars, but became more and more modified by Moslem\r\nfeudalism. Under such conditions, Timur, high-born and adventurous,\r\nchivalrous and literary, fanatical and cruel, achieved an empire that\r\nwas large and splendid, but personal to himself, and destined to vanish\r\nalmost with its founder. Yet he presaged a time when in Asia and Europe\r\nalike there should come, after the disintegrating individualism of the\r\nfourteenth and fifteenth centuries, a period of the gathering together of\r\nlands and peoples into large units under strong personal governments.\r\n\r\nBaber, descendant of Timur in the sixth generation, descendant also of\r\nGenghis Khan, came at the beginning of the new era. Less ruthless than\r\neither of his great ancestors, less legal than the “Inflexible One,”\r\nless Moslem than the “Scourge of Asia,” but possessed of much of the\r\nleadership and military genius of both, he stands forth, by reason of\r\nhis memoirs, as one of the best known conquerors of history. His love\r\nof carousing, his family affection, his literary bent, his toleration of\r\nheretics and infidels, his bold leadership, his liberality in dividing\r\nspoil, presented qualities and suggested modes of activity which were to\r\ncharacterize all his descendants down to the puritanical Aurangzeb.\r\n\r\nThus the family life of the house of Baber was far more normal than\r\nthat of the house of Osman. In contrast with an almost unbroken line\r\nof Ottoman slave mothers and wives, whose names with those of their\r\ndaughters have hardly survived, many of the Mogul imperial ladies are\r\nwell known. Witness the princess Gul-Badan, daughter of Baber, who like\r\nher father wrote memoirs; the empress Nur-Jehan, who ruled India for a\r\ntime; and the empress Mumtaz-Mahal, for whom her devoted husband built\r\nthe fairest of all mausoleums. Turki princesses, ladies of high Persian\r\ndescent, and daughters of Hindu _Rajahs_, were taken into the imperial\r\nharem, where, though women and eunuchs were present “from Russia,\r\nCircassia, Mingrelia, Georgia, and Ethiopia,” no emperors sprang from\r\nslave mothers during the period of greatness. With such a policy in\r\nthe family which constituted a chief element in the unity of the Mogul\r\nEmpire, it was but natural that officers and soldiers, statesmen and\r\npublic servants, should be accepted with a like catholicity. The best\r\nfighters, of course, continued to be those who came down newly from the\r\nhigh country beyond the northwest passes; and since such of these as met\r\nsuccess were apt to send for relatives and friends, there was continual\r\nrecruiting from among Tatars, Persians, Afghans, and Arabs,—all Moslems,\r\nbut of various sects. “Rûmis” from the Ottoman Empire were especially\r\nuseful in the artillery service. Some of them were doubtless European\r\nrenegades, but “Firinjis” or Franks were likely to come more directly\r\nfrom Portugal and other European countries. Yet by no means all the brave\r\nwere from foreign lands. Many Rajputs under their own _Rajahs_ served the\r\nMogul emperors most acceptably, and when treated without prejudice they\r\nwere faithful. The high officers of government were usually Persians; but\r\nAkbar was nobly served by the great Todar Mal, and appointed _Rajahs_\r\nto govern the Punjab and Bengal. About one in eight of his paid cavalry\r\nchiefs was a Hindu; and of the lesser civil-service positions the mere\r\nnecessity for numbers, apart from superior skill and training, required\r\nthat many should be held by Hindus.\r\n\r\nIt is not that slavery had disappeared from the Mogul system. Traces of\r\nthe old method can be discerned as late as the eighteenth century. In\r\nfact, Muhammad Khan, a Bangash _Nawab_ of Farrukhabad, maintained what\r\nwas practically a replica in miniature of the Ottoman system. Hindu boys\r\nbetween the ages of seven and thirteen, some of them sons of Rajputs\r\nand Brahmins, were seized, bought, or accepted as _chelas_ or slaves to\r\nthe number of one or two hundred a year. They were taught to read and\r\nwrite, and were specially rewarded when the task was completed. Five\r\nhundred _chelas_ from eighteen to twenty years of age were trained as a\r\nregiment of musketeers. From among the older _chelas_ were chosen the\r\nofficers of the household, generals of the army, and deputy governors\r\nof provinces. The _Nawab_ arranged marriages between _chelas_ and the\r\ndaughters of _chelas_. He encouraged them to acquire personal property,\r\nwhich he could claim in time of need; but he forbade them to found towns\r\nor build masonry structures, lest occupying these they might tend toward\r\nindependence. Muhammad Khan did not, however, depend exclusively on his\r\nHindu slaves; he sent money to his own Bangash tribe, and thus obtained\r\na colony of Afghans to whom he gave high military positions and upon\r\nsome of whom he bestowed his daughters in marriage. Other vassals of\r\nthe emperor made use of a similar slave system; and it is not unlikely\r\nthat the emperor himself recruited his permanent infantry with the help\r\nof slavery, and that he promoted some slaves to high positions. But the\r\nabsence of definite information in this direction is in most striking\r\ncontrast to its abundant presence in the records which deal with the\r\nOttoman Empire in the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nIn theory the officers of government were so far the servants of the\r\nemperor that their accumulated personal property belonged to him at their\r\ndeath; but in practice the opulence and the generosity of the sovereign\r\nled him often to leave such wealth in the hands of the officers’\r\nchildren. When this was not done, employment in the public service was\r\nassigned to sons and pensions were granted to widows.\r\n\r\nTitles of nobility were awarded for life to distinguished officials; the\r\nchief officers of the central government and governors of great provinces\r\nwere called _Emirs_ (_Omrahs_ in many Western writings, probably a\r\nplural of majesty), generals of the army were _Khans_, and distinguished\r\nsoldiers of lesser rank were _Bahadurs_ or knights. Khondamir says that\r\nHumayun organized a system of twelve orders or arrows, according to which\r\nthe entire imperial household was graded. “The twelfth arrow, which\r\nwas made of the purest gold, was put in the auspicious quiver of this\r\npowerful king, and nobody could dare to touch it. The eleventh arrow\r\nbelonged to His Majesty’s relations and brethren, and all the sultans\r\nwho were in the government employ. Tenth, to the great _mushaikhs_,\r\n_saiyids_, and the learned and religious men. Ninth, to the great nobles.\r\nEighth, to the courtiers and some of the king’s personal attendants.\r\nSeventh, to the attendants in general. Sixth, to the _harems_ and to the\r\nwell-behaved female attendants. Fifth, to young maid-servants. Fourth,\r\nto the treasurers and stewards. Third, to the soldiers. Second, to the\r\nmenial servants. First, to the palace guards, camel-drivers, and the\r\nlike. Each of these arrows or orders had three grades; the highest,\r\nthe middle, and the lowest.” Appointments and promotions were, as at\r\nConstantinople, based upon valor and manifest ability. Through all the\r\nperiod of greatness the ladder of advancement was kept so clear that\r\nvigor, courage, and prowess could mount from the lowest ranks to the\r\nsteps of the throne.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELATION OF GOVERNMENT TO RELIGIOUS PROPAGATION\r\n\r\nWhen the Ottoman Turks conquered their European territories, as well as\r\nparts of their Asiatic dominions, they for the first time introduced\r\nthe Moslem religion. This was not the case with the Mogul advance into\r\nIndia. Beginning with Mohammed ben Kasim’s invasion of Sind in 712 A.D.,\r\nand starting afresh with Mahmûd of Ghazni in 1000 A.D., the Moslem\r\npolitical control, accompanied by the conversion of a portion of the\r\nnative population, had spread step by step until, when Baber came after\r\neight centuries, there remained little of India that was not actually or\r\nhad not at some time been under Moslem rule. No data appear to exist for\r\ndetermining the actual proportion of the total population that was Moslem\r\nduring the Mogul period. Guesses have been made ranging from a possible\r\none in four to Bernier’s estimate of one in hundreds. The only basis of\r\nany value would perhaps be that obtained by working backward from the\r\nBritish censuses. In 1911 the Mohammedans constituted about twenty-one\r\nper cent of the population of India, and their number was increasing at\r\na slightly more rapid rate than the average. It may be supposed that the\r\nincrease of the Moslem proportion was greater during the days of the\r\nMogul Empire, when it was especially profitable to change, and when there\r\nwas a strong inward flow at the northwest; but since the Mogul decline\r\nthe rate of relative progress has probably always been slow. Perhaps the\r\nproportion about 1761 was somewhat less than one in five, and in 1526 it\r\nmay have been not more than one in from ten to twenty. Bernier’s guess\r\nwould certainly seem to have been wild, for it is inconceivable that so\r\nsmall progress would have been made in a thousand years and so great in\r\nthe next two hundred. No doubt the Moslem contingent was then, as it is\r\nnow, unevenly distributed, being in high proportion in the northwest and\r\ndiminishing gradually with the distance from the mountain passes. At\r\npoints on the seacoast where trade had been active, the Moslem influence\r\nhad come early by way of the sea; hence there also the percentage was\r\ngreater. In Suleiman’s empire, comprising as it did a large amount of old\r\nMoslem territory and including even the Holy Cities, the proportion of\r\nMoslems was, of course, much higher; but it diminished rapidly from south\r\nto north, until in Hungary it must have been extremely attenuated.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of an elaborate slave system in India, there was not the\r\nsteady public machinery of conversion which operated powerfully in the\r\nOttoman Empire. Furthermore, it would seem that before the reign of\r\nAurangzeb no emperor cared to promote conversion to Islam by financial\r\nor political rewards. Akbar, in fact, removed the jizyeh, or poll-tax,\r\nwhich had previously, as in all other truly Moslem lands until recent\r\ntimes, laid special burdens upon unbelievers, and the tax was not\r\nreimposed until the time of Aurangzeb. Akbar also forbade the enslavement\r\nof captives and of their wives and children. For a century, therefore,\r\nthe government lent little encouragement to change of faith. Down to the\r\naccession of Aurangzeb there was a clear contrast between Ottoman and\r\nMogul policy in the attitude toward the Moslem religion: the Moguls held\r\nfar less than the Ottomans to the idea of the conquest of the world for\r\nIslam, or to the conversion of unbelievers, as an object of governmental\r\nendeavor. Aurangzeb alone had such zeal as characterizes the average\r\ndescendant of Osman; he desired no infidels in his service, and regarded\r\nthe Deccan as the _Dar-ul-harb_ which he wished to make part of the\r\n_Dar-ul-Islam_. There can be no doubt, however, that under all the Mogul\r\nemperors the social pressure usual in Moslem lands continued to encourage\r\nconversion privately, while the slavery which Islam normally sanctions\r\nwas also contributing to the increase of the faithful. Moreover, it is\r\nnot likely that all the officers of the liberal emperors were as tolerant\r\nand as indifferent to Moslem progress as were their superiors.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ARMY\r\n\r\nAt Delhi, as at Constantinople, no sharp line could be drawn separating\r\ngovernment and army. The Mogul conquest was achieved by an army, and\r\nthe army became a government. Amalgamation with older systems of course\r\nintroduced groups of under-officials who had no military duties; but\r\nthose who would be great had to be capable of military command, men who\r\nmight be familiar with the pen but who must know how to wield the sword.\r\n\r\nThe Mogul army organization seems, in the midst of confused testimonies,\r\nto have borne a considerable resemblance to that of the Ottomans. The\r\nemperor was commander-in-chief, and as late as Aurangzeb regularly\r\ncommanded in person in great campaigns. He had a personal army of\r\n12,000 to 15,000 paid infantry and 12,000 to 40,000 paid cavalry.\r\nThese corresponded in number and function, but not at all in political\r\nimportance, to the Janissaries and _Spahis_ of the Porte among the\r\nOttomans. In great campaigns the standing army was supported by the\r\nfeudal cavalry, estimated at from 200,000 to 400,000, and by indefinite\r\nnumbers of irregular infantry, drawn from a mass estimated at four\r\nmillions. The army was strong in artillery, and possessed in trained\r\nelephants a force of which the Ottomans could not make use.\r\n\r\nThe emperor’s infantry were, at least from Akbar’s time, matchlockmen;\r\nthey seem to have been the only trustworthy and efficient foot-soldiers.\r\nIt would appear that their clumsy weapons, improved by Akbar himself,\r\nwere not changed up to the time of Aurangzeb; for Bernier reports that in\r\nhis day the muskets were rested on forks and fired by men who squatted\r\non the ground, and who feared that the flash might damage their eyebrows\r\nand beards. On account of the method of payment it is not possible to\r\nestimate closely the number of the emperor’s cavalry, or _Mansabdars_.\r\nMen who agreed to furnish from five to five thousand troopers were taken\r\ninto his service, and pay (_mansab_) was assigned for the stipulated\r\nnumber; but even in Akbar’s time, according to Badauni, it was possible\r\nto present followers hired only for the occasion, and yet to draw\r\nlife-long pay for their services. In later years there ceased to be even\r\napproximate correspondence between the amount of pay and the number of\r\ntroops furnished. The _mansab_ was then regarded as a salary, or even as\r\na pension.\r\n\r\nThe more numerous feudal cavalry consisted of the holders (with their\r\nfollowers) of _jagirs_, or grants, of the revenue of districts of larger\r\nor smaller size, in return for which they served without other pay,\r\nexcept in case of unduly prolonged campaigns. Holders of large areas\r\nwere accustomed to administer them in person, whereas those who held\r\nsmaller sections would often leave the administration to the governors\r\nof provinces, who in time tended to appropriate the revenues. Aurangzeb,\r\nhowever, pursued the policy of assigning service in regions remote from\r\nthe appointee’s _jagir_, and of retaining wives and children at the\r\ncourt as pledges of fidelity. Hindu _Rajahs_ were easily brought into\r\nthe system by being invested with analogous rights in their hereditary\r\nterritories. Apart from these cases, the appointments, as in Turkey,\r\nwere not regarded as hereditary, but were apt to be given to fresh\r\nrecruits of ability from beyond the mountains. It was customary to make\r\nsmall assignments to sons of dead _Jagirdars_, and to increase their\r\nallowances upon proof of merit. _Jagirdars_ and _Rajahs_, like Timariotes\r\nand _Zaims_, had jurisdiction and other governmental duties in the areas\r\nassigned to them, and thus carried a large part of the task of local\r\ngovernment. Ultimately many of the higher positions became hereditary in\r\nfamilies which worked toward independence in the days of decline.\r\n\r\nThe artillery seems to have been surprisingly strong under Baber and\r\nHumayun, and to have declined later. Baber is said to have had seven\r\nhundred guns at Panipat, which he chained together after the method\r\nemployed by Selim I at Kaldiran. Humayun is reported to have had at\r\nKanauj seven hundred guns discharging stone balls of five pounds\r\nweight, and twenty-one guns discharging brass balls ten times as heavy.\r\nAurangzeb, it is said, transported seventy pieces of heavy artillery\r\nand two or three hundred swivel guns, mounted on the backs of camels.\r\nFor fortress defence and siege operations the Moguls had a few enormous\r\nguns, some of which are said to have required for transport two hundred\r\nand fifty and even five hundred oxen! In addition to these resources, it\r\nappears, if testimonies can be trusted, that Akbar kept five thousand\r\nwar elephants, each of which was accounted equal in time of battle to\r\nfive hundred horsemen; and Hawkins says that Jehangir had twelve thousand\r\nelephants of all descriptions. Aurangzeb is reported to have maintained\r\nin the palace stables the more modest number of eight hundred elephants.\r\n\r\nThe early Mogul armies were efficient and successful. Aurangzeb, however,\r\nconducted about the Deccan in his twenty-four years’ war of conquest a\r\nhorde that resembled a migration rather than an army. For each fighting\r\nman there were at least two camp-followers; the march was without\r\ndiscipline and order, like the movement of a herd of animals; and the\r\ncamp was a city five miles long, or, as others say, seven and a half\r\nmiles, or twenty miles in circumference. One European observer even\r\nreported that the encampment was thirty miles about, and contained five\r\nmillion souls! Among these he counted seven hundred thousand soldiers,\r\nof whom three hundred thousand were cavalry. With all due allowance\r\nfor exaggeration, the Mogul army clearly tended to become exceedingly\r\nnumerous, but of increasing weakness and inefficiency. A battle in 1526\r\nbetween Baber and Suleiman would have been a worthy contest, but the army\r\nof Aurangzeb would probably have been defeated easily by the Ottoman\r\ntroops which bit the dust before Prince Eugene.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COURT\r\n\r\nSplendid as was the display of Suleiman’s _entourage_, it lacked the\r\nfinancial basis which the Moguls possessed from Akbar to Aurangzeb.\r\nGold and silver, gems, silks and muslins, were far more abundant in the\r\neastern land. A more highly developed architecture, showing far greater\r\nrichness of detailed ornamentation, served in India to construct not only\r\ntemples of religion and tombs of great personages, but also marvellous\r\npalaces and pleasure-houses for the emperors. Many thousands of\r\nattendants supplied every possible luxury and rendered every conceivable\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nNo systematic description of the organization of the imperial household\r\nhas come to hand. Scattered allusions reveal the presence of very\r\nnumerous groups of officials, agents, and servants of all grades.\r\nTeachers, physicians, scholars, valets, chamberlains, butlers, cooks,\r\nkitchen servants, musicians, poets, generals, captains, guards,\r\nequerries, hostlers, herdsmen, elephant-drivers, and stablemen, ministers\r\nof state, judges, treasurers, secretaries, swarmed about the great halls\r\nand myriad chambers of the palaces at Agra, Delhi, and Fatehpur-Sikri.\r\nThese, with the tradespeople who made their living by supplying the\r\nhousehold but who were less directly attached to the emperor, constituted\r\na migratory city of large size, which followed the emperor from residence\r\nto residence and in time of campaign swelled almost unbelievably the\r\nfollowing of his enormous army.\r\n\r\nAs for the court life which went on at the center of this vast and\r\nmulti-colored setting, this was necessarily twofold, by that custom of\r\nall Moslem lands according to which the sexes must be segregated. Daily\r\nassemblages, gatherings at the mosques on Fridays, great ceremonies\r\nfor special occasions, and the imperial hunts contained none but men as\r\nparticipants. If women saw any part of such festivities, it was from a\r\ndistance and through thick veils or close-wrought lattices. Khondamir\r\nsays that Humayun divided his attendants into three great classes,\r\nconcerned respectively with government and war, with learning and\r\nliterature, and with music and personal grace and beauty. The latter\r\nwere called “people of pleasure ... because most people take great\r\ndelight in the company of such young-looking men, of rosy cheeks and\r\nsweet voices, and are pleased by hearing their songs, and the pleasing\r\nsound of the musical instruments, such as the harp, the sackbut, and the\r\nlute.” Humayun devoted Sundays and Tuesdays to dealings with the first\r\nclass, holding audience and attending to government duties on those\r\ndays. Saturdays and Thursdays were days when “the tree of the hope” of\r\nliterary and religious persons “produced the fruit of prosperity by\r\ntheir obtaining audience in the paradise-resembling court.” Mondays and\r\nWednesdays were devoted to pleasure parties, when old companions and\r\nchosen friends were entertained by musicians and singers. On Fridays were\r\nconvened “all the assemblies,” whatever this may mean; and the emperor\r\nsat with them as long as he could.\r\n\r\nThe splendor of the court may be illustrated by two or three extracts.\r\nNizam-uddin Ahmad relates that Akbar, journeying in the fifteenth year\r\nof his reign, accepted an invitation to rest at Dipalpur. “For some days\r\nfeasting went on, and upon the last day splendid offerings were presented\r\nto him. Arab and Persian horses, with saddles of silver; huge elephants,\r\nwith chains of gold and silver, and housings of velvet and brocade; and\r\ngold and silver, and pearls and jewels, and rubies and garnets of great\r\nprice; chairs of gold, and silver vases, and vessels of gold and silver;\r\nstuffs of Europe, Turkey, and China, and other precious things beyond\r\nall conception. Presents of similar kind also were presented for the\r\nyoung princes and the emperor’s wives. All the ministers and attendants\r\nand dignitaries received presents, and every soldier of the army also\r\nparticipated in the bounty.”\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Roe describes a curious annual ceremony of the Mogul emperors\r\nas carried through by Jehangir. “The first of September was the King’s\r\nBirth-day, and the solemnitie of his weighing, to which I went, and was\r\ncarryed into a very large and beautiful Garden, the square within all\r\nwater, on the sides flowers and trees, in the midst a Pinacle, where was\r\nprepared the scales, being hung in large tressels, and a crosse beame\r\nplated on with Gold thinne: the scales of massie Gold, the borders set\r\nwith small stones, Rubies and Turkeys, the Chaines of Gold large and\r\nmassie, but strengthened with silke Cords. Here attended the Nobilitie,\r\nall sitting about it on Carpets until the King came; who at last appeared\r\nclothed or rather loden with Diamonds, Rubies, Pearles, and other\r\nprecious vanities, so great, so glorious; his Sword, Target, Throne to\r\nrest on, correspondent; his head, necke, breast, armes, above the elbows,\r\nat the wrists, his fingers every one, with at least two or three Rings;\r\nfettered with chaines, or dyalled Diamonds; Rubies as great as Wal-nuts,\r\nsome greater; and Pearles such as mine eyes were amazed at. Suddenly he\r\nentered into the scales, sate like a woman on his legges, and there was\r\nput in against him many bagges to fit his weight, which were changed\r\nsix times, and they say was silver, and that I understood his weight to\r\nbe nine thousand rupias, which are almost one thousand pounds sterling:\r\nafter with Gold and Jewels, and precious stones, but I saw none, it being\r\nin bagges might be Pibles; then against Cloth of Gold, Silk, Stuffes,\r\nLinen, Spices, and all sorts of goods, but I must believe for they were\r\nin sardles. Lastly against Meale, Butter, Corne, which is said to be\r\ngiven to the Banian.” The extract neglects to state that the ceremony was\r\nfollowed by the distribution as largesse of all the valuables weighed\r\nagainst the royal person with its heavy adornments.\r\n\r\nBernier describes an audience of Aurangzeb. “The king appeared seated\r\nupon his throne at the end of the great hall in the most magnificent\r\nattire. His vest was of white and delicately flowered satin, with a silk\r\nand gold embroidery of the finest texture. The turban of gold cloth had\r\nan aigrette whose base was composed of diamonds of an extraordinary\r\nsize and value, besides an oriental topaz which may be pronounced\r\nunparalleled, exhibiting a lustre like the sun. A necklace of immense\r\npearls suspended from his neck reached to the stomach. The throne was\r\nsupported by six massy feet, said to be of solid gold, sprinkled over\r\nwith rubies, emeralds, and diamonds. It was constructed by Shah-Jehan\r\nfor the purpose of displaying the immense quantity of precious stones\r\naccumulated successively in the Treasury from the spoils of ancient\r\n_Rajahs_ and _Pathans_, and the annual presents to the monarch which\r\nevery Omrah is bound to make on certain festivals. At the foot of the\r\nthrone were assembled all the Omrahs, in splendid apparel, upon a\r\nplatform surrounded by a silver railing and covered by a spacious canopy\r\nof brocade with deep fringes of gold. The pillars of the hall were hung\r\nwith brocades of a gold ground, and flowered satin canopies were raised\r\nover the whole expanse of the extensive apartment, fastened with red\r\nsilken cords from which were suspended large tassels of silk and gold.\r\nThe floor was covered entirely with carpets of the richest silk, of\r\nimmense length and breadth.”\r\n\r\nAs regards the female side of the court, although this had almost\r\na separate organization and was, in keeping with Moslem and Indian\r\ntradition, to a large extent secluded, yet the imperial ladies possessed\r\na measure of freedom through two centuries which allowed several of them\r\nto stand forth as distinct individuals, and a few to influence affairs\r\nprofoundly. Jehangir assigned to the women of the household the sixth\r\nand fifth orders, or arrows, of rank. Akbar is said to have kept five\r\nthousand women in his harem. As usual, however, only a few of these were\r\nwives or votaries of the imperial pleasure; most of them constituted an\r\nelaborate organization for the housekeeping and entertainment of the few\r\ngreat ladies, the mother, aunts, sisters, wives, and favorites of the\r\nemperor. As already indicated, these women were of all kinds,—free-born\r\nand slave, Moslem, Christian, and pagan, Turki, Afghan, Persian,\r\nHindu, Armenian, Slavic, Circassian, Georgian, and Ethiopian. Their\r\ncommunication with the outside world was kept up through their relatives\r\nand through eunuchs.\r\n\r\nA few of the imperial ladies may be mentioned. The princess Gul-Badan,\r\nthird daughter of Baber and Dil-Dar, wrote a history of the deeds of her\r\nhalf-brother, Humayun. In her later life she went with other great ladies\r\non pilgrimage to Mecca, taking seven years for the journey; one-half\r\nof this time she spent in Arabia, where she performed the rites of the\r\npilgrimage four times. After twenty more years filled with works of piety\r\nand charity she died at the age of eighty. Her nephew, Akbar, with his\r\nown hand helped bear her to the tomb.\r\n\r\nMost powerful of all the Mogul imperial ladies was the Persian Nur-Jehan,\r\nor Nur-Mahal, wife of Jehangir. Born in poverty and actually cast away\r\nby her parents, she rose to the throne of command. Mohammad Hadi says\r\nthat “by degrees she became, in all but name, undisputed sovereign of the\r\nempire, and the king himself became a tool in her hands. He used to say\r\nthat Nur-Jehan Begam has been selected, and is wise enough, to conduct\r\nthe matters of state, and that he wanted only a bottle of wine and a\r\npiece of meat to keep himself merry. Nur-Jehan won golden opinions from\r\nall people. She was liberal and just to all who begged her support. She\r\nwas an asylum for all sufferers, and helpless girls were married at the\r\nexpense of her private purse. She must have portioned above five hundred\r\ngirls in her lifetime, and thousands were grateful for her generosity.”\r\nNot only could she rule the empire effectively, if not always wisely and\r\nimpartially, but she could lead armies. Defeated at last by Shah-Jehan,\r\nshe put on perpetual robes of mourning for her dead husband and spent her\r\nlast eighteen years in devoted seclusion.\r\n\r\nMumtaz-Mahal, niece of Nur-Jehan and wife of Shah-Jehan, did not aspire\r\nto political control. She held fast the heart of her imperial husband and\r\nbecame the mother of his fourteen children. The incomparable Taj Mahal,\r\nbuilt by the emperor after her untimely death, bears eternal witness to\r\ngreat love followed by great grief.\r\n\r\nLast may be mentioned two of the daughters of Mumtaz-Mahal, Jehan-Ara and\r\nRaushan-Ara. These ladies, like Charlemagne’s daughters too great for\r\nmatrimony, stirred up much trouble in the imperial household. Jehan-Ara\r\nwas her father’s favorite in his decadent old age, and an active partisan\r\nof her brother Dara. Of vast influence for many years, she was at\r\nlength overshadowed by Raushan-Ara, who supported Aurangzeb and rose to\r\ngreatness with his advancing fortunes. Bernier was well-nigh overcome\r\nby a distant view of this lady’s majesty. “I cannot avoid dwelling on\r\nthis pompous procession of the Seraglio. Stretch imagination to its\r\nutmost limits, and you can imagine no exhibition more grand and imposing\r\nthan when Raushan-Ara Begam, mounted on a stupendous Pegu elephant, and\r\nseated in a _meghdambhar_ blazing with gold and azure, is followed by\r\nfive or six elephants with _meghdambhars_ nearly as resplendent as her\r\nown, and filled with ladies attached to her household (and succeeded by\r\nthe most distinguished ladies of the court) until fifteen or sixteen\r\nfemales of quality pass with a grandeur of appearance, equipage, and\r\nretinue, more or less proportionate to their rank, pay, and office. There\r\nis something very impressive of state and royalty in the march of these\r\nsixty or more elephants; in their solemn and as it were measured steps,\r\nin the splendour of the _meghdambhars_, and the brilliant and innumerable\r\nfollowers in attendance; and if I had not regarded this display of\r\nmagnificence with a sort of philosophical indifference, I should have\r\nbeen apt to be carried away by such flights of imagination as inspire\r\nmost of the Indian poets, when they represent the elephants as conveying\r\nso many goddesses concealed from the vulgar gaze.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GOVERNMENT PROPER\r\n\r\n“The authority of the Great Mogul was despotic by all its origins: by\r\nthe fact of the conquest, by the Turkish tradition, by the tradition of\r\nthe old royalties of the country”;[798] and also, it may be added, by\r\nthe practice of Islamic governments since the abandonment of Medina as\r\nthe seat of the caliphs. The conquering chief owned all the conquered\r\nland, and the wealth and labor and lives of its inhabitants were at his\r\ndisposal. As for the restriction of despotism by the Sacred Law, the\r\nhouse of Baber did not feel this strongly until late. On the other hand,\r\neven a drunkard like Jehangir had a keen sense of the responsibility\r\nof his high position. The emperor considered it his duty to maintain\r\norder, reward faithful service, and sit daily on the bench of justice\r\nto redress the wrongs of his people. Aurangzeb is reported by Bernier\r\nto have expressed his feeling of responsibility by saying: “Being born\r\nthe son of a king and placed on the throne, I was sent into the world\r\nby Providence to live and labour, not for myself, but for others; ...\r\nit is my duty not to think of my own happiness, except so far as it is\r\ninseparably connected with the happiness of my people. It is the repose\r\nand prosperity of my subjects that it behoves me to consult; nor are\r\nthese to be sacrificed to anything besides the demands of justice, the\r\nmaintenance of the royal authority, and the security of the State.” One\r\nof his letters to his imprisoned father contains these words: “Almighty\r\nGod bestows his trusts upon him who discharges the duty of cherishing his\r\nsubjects and protecting the people. It is manifest and clear to the wise\r\nthat a wolf is no fit shepherd, neither can a faint-hearted man carry\r\nout the great duty of government. Sovereignty is the guardianship of the\r\npeople, not self-indulgence and profligacy. The Almighty will deliver\r\nyour humble servant from all feeling of remorse as regards your Majesty.”\r\nThe sole fountain of legislation, the emperor observed economy in the\r\nissuance of it, making use, so far as possible, of established Islamic\r\npractice and immemorial custom. Yet from time to time, by administrative\r\nregulations, ordinances, and decrees, he sought to improve the methods of\r\ngovernment. Aurangzeb, so much like Suleiman in many other respects, like\r\nhim also ordered and financed the compilation of a code of the Sacred\r\nLaw. It does not appear, however, that any such quantity of personal\r\nlegislation was issued by him or by any other Mogul emperor as by the\r\ngreat Ottoman.\r\n\r\nThe succession to the Mogul throne never became regular, since neither by\r\nMongol nor by Moslem custom was any one method prescribed. Nor did the\r\nmore kindly disposition of the house of Baber ever permit the publication\r\nof such a decree as that of Mohammed II for the execution of brothers\r\nupon the accession of a sovereign. Accordingly the resources of the\r\nempire were apt to be wasted in civil wars between father and son, and\r\nbetween older and younger brothers. Even the sons of Baber engaged in\r\ncivil war: Kamran, aided by Askari and Hindal, fought against Humayun.\r\nAkbar’s brothers were so young that he had no rival at the time of his\r\naccession. His two elder sons drank themselves to death; but this did not\r\nprevent Selim, who became the emperor Jehangir, from rebelling against\r\nhis father and hastening the latter’s death. Jehangir’s two sons rebelled\r\nagainst him in turn. Shah-Jehan’s four sons, Dara, Shuja, Murad, and\r\nAurangzeb, fought together until the last encompassed the death of the\r\nothers, besides keeping his father a prisoner during the last seven years\r\nof life. The mournful story need not be carried beyond the fierce civil\r\nwar which followed the death of Aurangzeb, in which two of his sons were\r\nslain. Clearly, the Ottoman method was more practical if less humane. So\r\nunstable was the personal situation of the emperor that, if he failed to\r\nshow his face in public daily, the empire fell into commotion and civil\r\nwar became imminent. From the uncertainty of the succession the state, at\r\nleast, derived this benefit, that the fittest of the candidates for power\r\nwas likely to obtain the throne. Nevertheless, as Dow says, “to be born\r\na prince” of the Mogul Empire was “a misfortune of the worst and most\r\nembarrassing kind. He must die by clemency, or wade through the blood of\r\nhis family to safety and empire.”\r\n\r\nAs the army was the defence and prop of the Mogul government, so finance\r\nwas its sustenance. Here again the regulations of the Sacred Law were\r\nbut scantily observed. Akbar, aided by Todar Mal and extending the\r\nmethods of the Afghan Sher Shah, reduced to order and regularity the\r\nexisting revenue system, which in the course of centuries of varying\r\nrule had become much confused. By ancient custom of India, the sovereign\r\nas primary owner of the land was entitled to one-third of the crops in\r\nkind. It was Akbar’s task to change the system to a more modern money\r\nrégime, a step in progress which the Ottomans have not been able to\r\ntake even to the present day. In classical times as in late years,\r\nIndia, importing less of other commodities than she exported, steadily\r\nabsorbed gold and silver. It is likely that a large share of the wealth\r\nof the newly-discovered Americas had already by Akbar’s day made its way\r\nto India through the increasing Portuguese trade, and that Columbus,\r\nCortes, and Pizarro thus unwittingly gave him the means of modernizing\r\nhis land revenue. Several great tasks were involved in the change. All\r\nthe cultivated land of India had to be measured, its quality judged,\r\nits average annual produce for the first nineteen years of Akbar’s\r\nreign calculated, and the amount of the government’s share for each\r\ntract reduced to current money. At first, it was attempted to renew\r\nthe settlement annually; but, since this proved very difficult in a\r\nlarge and conservative land, a ten-year basis was eventually adopted.\r\nWhen the British came to power they found the revenue in a state of\r\nconfusion which indicated that at some time during the Mogul period the\r\nevaluation had ceased to be made regularly, modifications of the last\r\nassessment having then been introduced successively, until all system had\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nThe imperial revenue was collected by a separate hierarchy of officials.\r\nThe great provinces were divided into districts, or _sirkars_, in each\r\nof which a _Diwan_ was chief financial agent. His office was the _Defter\r\nali_, and his clerks were _Mutasidis_. In lesser districts the collectors\r\nwere _Amils_ or _Karoris_, the treasurers _Fotadars_. _Karkums_ were\r\nappointed to settle disputes and audit accounts. The crown revenue\r\nmight be farmed out, in areas of a size comparable to the _jagirs_,\r\nto officials known as _Zamindars_ or _Talukdars_, who in the days of\r\ndecline strove to make their position hereditary. In the local unit, or\r\n_pargana_, the government was represented by a _Kanungo_, who kept the\r\nrecords of assessments and payments. Akbar took measures also to bring\r\nunder cultivation waste and abandoned lands, and appointed for this\r\npurpose _Karoris_, whose efforts were attended with much success. In\r\nthe best days the imperial financial officers acted as a check upon the\r\ncivil and military officials, upholding alike the interests of emperor\r\nand common people. Evidence exists, however, that even in the time of\r\nAkbar there was financial corruption, and that revenue officials were not\r\nlacking who plundered the people and defrauded the emperor.\r\n\r\nThe granting of _jagirs_ to officers and _Rajahs_, of pensions to learned\r\nmen and others, and of land in full title, free from revenue, for\r\nreligious foundations seems to have diverted from the royal treasury\r\nabout two-thirds of the possible land revenue. On the other hand, it\r\nhas been estimated that the emperor received from customs, tolls,\r\nmiscellaneous taxes, and presents an amount equal to what he got from the\r\nland. Careful calculations have resulted in ascribing to Akbar a revenue\r\nof over two hundred million dollars annually, and to Aurangzeb as much\r\nas four hundred and fifty million dollars. Suleiman’s revenue would then\r\nhave been not the tenth part of Akbar’s and Louis XIV’s not the tenth\r\npart of Aurangzeb’s.\r\n\r\nThis revenue was expended upon the standing army, the court, the support\r\nof learned and religious persons, a series of building operations which\r\nwere perhaps costly beyond parallel, bountiful gifts at certain seasons,\r\nand regular charities. It would appear, farther, that the expenses of the\r\nprovincial governments were deducted from the imperial land revenue after\r\nit had been estimated but before it was paid into the treasury. In spite\r\nof the lavish outflow, however, an enormous treasure seems to have been\r\naccumulated. By Mandelslo it was estimated in 1638 at the incredible sum\r\nof one and a half billion crowns, equivalent to about the same number of\r\ndollars!\r\n\r\nIt was probably because of the greatly increased revenue which Akbar\r\nobtained by his new method that he found it possible to remit the\r\n_jizyeh_ or capitation tax on non-Moslems, and also the tax on pilgrims,\r\nwhich had made the earlier Moslem rule obnoxious to the Hindu population.\r\nOn the other hand, it may have been not merely religious zeal, but also\r\nfinancial stress caused by the civil wars preceding his accession, by\r\nthe Rajput revolt, by the long struggle in the Deccan, and by the pious\r\nremission of many taxes not authorized by the Sacred Law, including the\r\ntax on Hindu temple lands, that influenced Aurangzeb to reimpose the\r\ncapitation tax, and thus open wide the rifts in his disintegrating empire.\r\n\r\nIn the days of its greatness, the budget of the Mogul Empire, alike in\r\nincome and expenditure, reached a height which had rarely if ever been\r\nattained before. That of the East Roman Empire under the Macedonian\r\ndynasty, and of the Saracen Empire in the days of Harun Al-Rashid, may\r\nhave rivalled it; but it is probable that only the great Western powers,\r\nenriched by the industrial revolution in the late nineteenth and early\r\ntwentieth centuries, have ever reached a financial magnitude beyond that\r\nof the empire of Aurangzeb.\r\n\r\nHumayun divided the responsibilities of government among four ministers,\r\nand a fourfold division persisted at least as late as Aurangzeb. By a\r\ncurious form of logic the classification of duties and the names of the\r\nfour departments were based, not on convenience, but on relation to the\r\nfour elements: earth, air, fire, and water. The _Khaki_ department had\r\nthe care of agriculture, buildings, and domain lands; the _Hawai_, of the\r\nwardrobe, the kitchen, the stables, and the like; the _Ateshi_, of the\r\nartillery and the making of war material and other things in which fire\r\nwas employed; and the _Abi_, of the emperor’s drinks, and canals, rivers,\r\nand water-works. When Khondamir wrote, about 1534, one man had oversight\r\nof all four departments; but the development of a regular supreme\r\nofficial of great power, like the grand vizier of the Ottoman Empire,\r\nseems never to have taken place, no doubt because the imperial house did\r\nnot abandon the tradition of personal government.\r\n\r\nHumayun set aside two days of the week for business of state. Drums were\r\nbeaten to summon officials and give notice that the hall of audience\r\nwas open. Any subject might appear and ask for justice. Suits of fine\r\napparel and purses of money were at hand to reward the worthy, and\r\nexecutioners stood by with drawn swords to punish the guilty. Guns were\r\nfired at the close of the audience to notify officials that they might\r\nretire. Aurangzeb held general court in the great hall of audience for\r\ntwo hours on regular days. Persons who had petitions to present held\r\nthem up, and these were taken by the emperor, read by him, and often\r\ngranted on the spot. On at least one day in the week he sat with the two\r\n_Kazis_ of the city, and on another day he heard privately ten cases of\r\npersons of low rank. In the evening the chief officers were commanded\r\nto be present in a smaller hall, where Aurangzeb sat to “grant private\r\naudiences to his officers, receive their reports, and deliberate on\r\nimportant matters of state.” This gathering resembled the Divan of\r\nSuleiman, but it lacked most of the latter’s judicial work; in India such\r\nwork was done by the chief judges sitting separately, or by the emperor\r\nin the great audiences. Furthermore, it was the sovereign and not a grand\r\nvizier who presided in this council. The assembly was deliberative in\r\nmatters of policy and general administration, and judicial in that it had\r\njurisdiction of cases which involved officers of high rank.\r\n\r\nFor purposes of local government the empire was divided into _subahs_,\r\nor provinces, each under a _Nawab_ (a plural of majesty, from _naib_,\r\noften called “nabob” by Westerners), or governor. Under Akbar the number\r\nof _subahs_ varied from fifteen to eighteen. Like the _Beylerbeys_ of\r\nthe Ottoman Empire, the _Nawabs_ tended to increase in number, the size\r\nof their provinces diminishing accordingly. The _Nawab_ was almost a\r\nlittle emperor in his province. He held audiences, commanded the army,\r\nconferred lesser titles, appointed and dismissed most officials, and\r\nwas the highest judicial authority. His power was limited, however, by\r\nthe emperor’s right to recall him, by the right of appeal in judicial\r\ncases from him to the emperor, and by the fact that the financial and\r\njudicial officers were separately appointed and were responsible only to\r\nthe throne. The _Nawab_ and his court were supported by lands granted\r\nin _jagir_. He might suspend the _jagirs_ of officers pending imperial\r\ndecision. He was responsible for the security and order of his province,\r\nand had _Faujdars_ under him in the several districts, who exercised\r\nmilitary command and the powers of chief of police and police judge,\r\ntheir position resembling somewhat that of the _Sanjak Beys_ of the\r\nOttoman system. The chief financial officers in each province were the\r\n_Diwans_, who, as explained above, collected the imperial revenue and\r\nhad oversight of all lesser revenue officers. They and their deputies\r\npossessed judicial powers in cases concerning finance and land titles.\r\nThe chief judge of the province, subject however to appeals to the\r\ngovernor, was the _Nizam_. He heard the serious criminal cases, and his\r\ndeputy, the _Daroga Adaulat al Aulea_, attended to most of the important\r\ncivil ones. Local _Kazis_, aided by _Muftis_, _Mohtesibs_, and _Kutwals_\r\nor mayors, kept order in the smaller cities and districts. _Rajahs_ who\r\nhad made terms with the emperor exercised powers very similar to those\r\nof the _Nawabs_. Their positions were secured by heredity, however, and\r\nin their provinces the imperial financial and judicial officers had no\r\njurisdiction. They simply owed military service and a certain amount\r\nof tribute, failing in which they might be reduced by force of arms.\r\nThe Ottoman system contained no subjects who were at once so secure of\r\ntheir positions, so nearly independent, and so powerful as the _Rajahs_.\r\nKurdish, Albanian, and Arabian chieftains were perhaps as secure and as\r\nindependent, but they were of very small wealth and might; while the\r\nVoivodes of Wallachia and Moldavia were not so secure or so independent.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the common people under this government is to be known\r\nmainly by inference. Various documents and acts show the benevolent\r\nintentions of emperors and high officials toward the masses. Whether from\r\nwise prevision or from genuine charitable feeling, there appears to have\r\nbeen much solicitude lest the cultivators of the soil should be reduced\r\nto utter penury or driven from their lands. Akbar, for instance, issued\r\nstrict orders that on military expeditions nothing should be taken\r\nfrom the people without careful assessment and immediate or subsequent\r\npayment. Nevertheless, at the best the result of the general policy\r\nwas to leave the cultivator little more than a bare living. The whole\r\nsystem drained away wealth to a few great cities and a comparatively\r\nfew persons. If but few complaints rose from the masses, it was because\r\ntheir lot was no worse than that of their forefathers had been for many\r\ngenerations. Aside from the periods of civil war, the Moguls gave peace\r\nand order. Akbar removed internal tolls two centuries before such a thing\r\nwas accomplished in France, and thus made of the land a single economic\r\nunit, with the result that in his reign India as a whole enjoyed such\r\nprosperity as she has known at very few other periods in her history.\r\n\r\nBefore the time of Aurangzeb special care was taken to conciliate the\r\nHindus. Akbar adopted definitely the policy of equal treatment for all,\r\na degree of toleration not to be found in the contemporary Europe of\r\nWilliam the Silent and Henry of Navarre. The government strove to abolish\r\nor mitigate such Hindu practices as were abhorrent to Mohammedanism, and\r\nat least one Moslem practice which offended the Hindus. Child-marriage,\r\nthe ordeal, and animal sacrifice were forbidden. Widows were to be\r\nburned on the funeral pyres of their husbands only with their own full\r\nconsent, and those who preferred to live might marry again. In the Rajput\r\ntributary states Hindu law of course prevailed. Probably in the regions\r\nunder direct Mogul rule Hindus were judged by their own law when Moslems\r\nwere not concerned and perhaps even by their own judges. It is true that\r\nthe Hindus had to wait until Akbar came to be released from the personal\r\ndisabilities imposed by earlier Moslem conquerors, that their temple\r\nlands were taxed until the time of Aurangzeb, and that Brahmans, pundits,\r\nand fakirs were perhaps only in Akbar’s presence treated with respect\r\nequal to that accorded _Sheiks_, _Seids_, and _Ulema_. But the emperors\r\nand their officers gave like justice to all; they permitted every man\r\nto worship according to the rites of his forefathers, and apparently\r\nnever had a thought, as had Selim the Cruel, of giving to all non-Moslem\r\nsubjects the choice between Islam and death. There was little ground for\r\ndiscontent until Aurangzeb began to apply a harsher policy.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOSLEMS AND THE MOSLEM CHURCH\r\n\r\nIn comparison with conditions in the Ottoman Empire, Moslems and\r\nnon-Moslems in the India of the early Moguls were far more nearly on\r\na level. This was due not merely to the toleration and indifference\r\nof the emperors, but even more to the circumstances of the conquest,\r\nunder which both groups were treated alike, since Baber at Panipat in\r\n1526 subdued the Moslem Lodi Sultans of Delhi, and at Kanwaha in 1527\r\nthe Hindu Rajput confederacy. Indian-born worshippers of Allah and of\r\nBrahma, Vishnu, and Siva were mingled in the same vast mass of conquered\r\nsubjects, equally separated from the victorious invaders. There was also,\r\nin all probability, a much greater difference of race between Baber’s\r\nhighlanders and the Moslems that he found in India than between the\r\nlatter and the Hindus; for many inter-marriages had taken place, and\r\nmany natives of India had joined the followers of the Prophet. Time, of\r\ncourse, diminished this distinction.\r\n\r\nSuleiman was distinctly the head of the Moslems of his empire. Through\r\nhis appointee the _Sheik-ul-Islam_, through his _Hoja_, the _Kaziaskers_,\r\nthe _Nakib-ol-Eshraf_, and other learned and saintly personages, he kept\r\nin close touch with the religious chiefs of the Mohammedan population.\r\nAll who prayed toward Mecca, at least from the older portions of the\r\nOttoman Empire, were attached by many ancient ties to the house of Osman.\r\nTheir ancestors had perhaps been converts through its activities, had\r\ncertainly fought for it, and had seen its gradual and vigorous rise to\r\ngreatness. No such vital bonds joined to the Moguls the great mass of\r\ntheir Moslem subjects. These remembered the glories and favors of lost\r\ndynasties, and were indebted to the new sovereigns only for defeats\r\nand humiliations which depressed them toward the level of the Hindus,\r\nwhom they had for centuries held to be far inferior to themselves. They\r\nhad no _Sheik-ul-Islam_, honored by the sovereign with a seat above\r\nhis own, whose decisions might determine the fate of the ruler or of\r\nthe empire. Almost as much to them as to the Hindus the emperor was a\r\nstranger and a foreigner, to whom should be rendered, because of his\r\npower, full submission and instant obedience, but not loyal affection and\r\nwhole-hearted devotion. There was ever an absence of solidarity between\r\nthe house of Timur and those Moslem subjects who had not come into India\r\nin the service of that house, and this was not least among the elements\r\nof weakness that shortened the life of the empire. When Rajputs had\r\nbeen stirred to revolt, when Mahrattas had grown great, when bronzed and\r\ncapable Moguls had been supplanted by “pale persons in petticoats,” who\r\nwere left to rally about the tottering throne? More than two and a half\r\ncenturies have elapsed since the Ottomans ceased to draw systematically\r\nfrom the strength of the Christian population, and yet the fighting stock\r\nof their Moslem subjects has never failed or grown weak or faltered in\r\nits loyalty; but Aurangzeb’s successors found few upon whom to rely,\r\nand of this few a very small proportion who would sacrifice their own\r\nfortunes freely, who would be faithful unto death.\r\n\r\nThe Moguls found in India _Sheiks_, _Dervishes_, _Seids_, and _Ulema_,\r\nmosques, schools, and pious foundations in abundance. In fact, the\r\ndeveloped system of Mohammedanism had extended itself over India with\r\nvisible results very much like those in all other Moslem lands, among\r\nthem the Ottoman Empire. From the ranks of those educated in Moslem lore\r\nwere taken teachers, judges, and counselors-at-law.\r\n\r\nThere must have existed for the children of the Moslem population\r\n_mektebs_, ordinary _medressehs_, and law schools, in which the Arabic\r\nlanguage and the sciences built upon the Koran, as well as the Persian\r\nlanguage and literature were taught. No doubt, also, the imperial\r\nhousehold contained systems of education, arranged for the two sexes\r\nseparately and prepared to train imperial and noble children and young\r\nattendants, servants, and slaves in the knowledge which was thought best\r\nadapted to fit them for life. It is interesting to notice what impression\r\nthe teaching regularly given to a young prince made (if Bernier can be\r\ntrusted) upon the keen intellect of Aurangzeb. When the latter became\r\nemperor, his old teacher, it appears, confidently presented himself at\r\nDelhi for reward. What, then, must have been his surprise to receive such\r\na deliverance as this from the lips of majesty!\r\n\r\n“Was it not incumbent upon my preceptor to make me acquainted with the\r\ndistinguishing features of every nation of the earth; its resources and\r\nstrength; its mode of warfare, its manners, religion, form of government,\r\nand wherein its interests principally consist, and, by a regular course\r\nof historical reading, to render me familiar with the origin of States;\r\ntheir progress and decline; the events, accidents, or errors, owing to\r\nwhich such great changes and mighty revolutions have been effected?... A\r\nfamiliarity with the language of surrounding nations may be indispensable\r\nin a king; but you would teach me to read and write Arabic; doubtless\r\nconceiving that you placed me under an everlasting obligation for\r\nsacrificing so large a portion of time to the study of a language wherein\r\nno one can hope to become proficient without ten or twelve years of close\r\napplication. Forgetting how many important subjects ought to be embraced\r\nin the education of a prince, you acted as if it were chiefly necessary\r\nthat he should possess great skill in grammar, and such knowledge as\r\nbelongs to a Doctor of Law; and thus did you waste the precious hours\r\nof my youth in the dry, unprofitable, and never-ending task of learning\r\nwords!... Ought you not to have instructed me on one point at least, so\r\nessential to be known by a king, namely, on the reciprocal duties between\r\nthe sovereign and his subjects? Ought you not also to have foreseen that\r\nI might at some future period be compelled to contend with my brothers,\r\nsword in hand, for the crown, and for my very existence? Such, as you\r\nmust well know, has been the fate of the children of almost every king of\r\nHindustan. Did you ever instruct me in the art of war, how to besiege a\r\ntown, or draw up an army in battle array? Happy for me that I consulted\r\nwiser heads than thine on these subjects! Go! withdraw to thy village.\r\nHenceforth let no person know either who thou art or what is become of\r\nthee.”\r\n\r\nIn this rebuke, whether it comes chiefly from Bernier or from Aurangzeb,\r\nis excellent criticism upon the stereotyped Moslem education, and\r\nmaterial enough to cheer the hearts of modern advocates of a closer\r\nrelation between subjects of instruction and the business of life.\r\n\r\nThe lack of solidarity between the mass of the Moslems of India and\r\nthe Mogul government, together with the religious indifference of\r\nseveral emperors, prevented the Moslem church there from reaching the\r\nfull measure of the dignity, influence, and authority of the Moslem\r\nInstitution in the Ottoman Empire. Humayun’s division of the household\r\ninto three classes shows that he gave highest rank not to the clergy\r\nbut to princes of the blood, with nobles and ministers of state and\r\nmilitary men. “The holy persons, the great _Musheiks_ (religious men),\r\nthe respectable _Seids_, the literati, the law officers, the scientific\r\npersons, poets, besides other great and respectable men formed the second\r\nclass.” The orders, or arrows, of nobility show a little more definitely\r\nthe place of the Moslem learned men, since they are assigned to the tenth\r\norder, after the monarch and the princes of the blood and the _Rajahs_.\r\n\r\nIn the palace-city of Fatehpur-Sikri, Akbar built a great hall, the\r\nIbadat-Khana, to which he repaired on holy nights with _Sheiks_, _Seids_,\r\n_Ulema_, and nobles. Finding that his followers could not keep the peace\r\nwhen mingled indiscriminately, he assigned one of the four sides of the\r\nhall to each group. Here he was accustomed to listen to theological\r\ndiscussions; and it appears that what he heard tended to destroy his\r\nrespect for the faith of the Prophet, and to predispose his mind toward\r\nthe eclectic religion which he instituted later. Says Badauni: “The\r\nlearned doctors used to exercise the sword of their tongues upon each\r\nother, and showed great pugnacity and animosity, till the various sects\r\ntook to calling each other infidels and perverts.” In course of time\r\nAkbar obtained a document signed by the principal _Ulema_, to the effect\r\nthat a just ruler is higher in the eyes of God than a doctor of the law\r\n(_Mujtahid_), that Akbar was a just ruler, and that therefore his decrees\r\nin matters of religion were binding upon the world. This declaration\r\nplaced Akbar distinctly above the Moslem church and at least on a level\r\nwith the prophet Mohammed; and he seems even to have played with the\r\nidea that he was himself God. Certainly he hoped to unify all creeds\r\nby his “divine faith.” His son and grandson were not much interested\r\nin religion, and not at all inclined to assume actively the religious\r\nheadship of the empire; under them, the Moslem church had to take care of\r\nitself. Religious interest appeared again in Aurangzeb, not in any spirit\r\nof free inquiry, but in a rigid conformity to the rules of the Sacred\r\nLaw. From those youthful days when he preferred the meagre life of a\r\nsaint to the splendors of princely state, down to the long-deferred close\r\nof his troubled career, Islam knew no more faithful observer of its rites\r\nand prescriptions. In Aurangzeb’s reign and in his alone did the Moslem\r\nreligion take such a place in India as in the Turkey of Suleiman’s time.\r\n\r\nThe learned Moslems of the Mogul Empire never had as the head of their\r\nhierarchy a personage of such dignity and power as the _Sheik-ul-Islam_\r\nof Constantinople. The _Sadr Jehan_ appears to have been concerned\r\nchiefly with the granting of land from the treasury to learned and\r\nreligious persons in lieu of pensions. The hierarchy of judges seems to\r\nhave been complete, at least in territory that was directly administered,\r\nwith two officials at court who corresponded to the _Kaziaskers_ of\r\nSuleiman, and with _Kazis_ of high rank in the chief city of each\r\nprovince and of lesser rank in other cities; but the functions of these\r\nofficers appear to have been more closely restricted than in the Ottoman\r\nEmpire, by reason of the superior jurisdictions of the emperor and\r\nthe governors, and of the criminal and financial jurisdictions of the\r\n_Nizams_ and _Diwans_ and their deputies. As there is little mention of\r\nthe _muftis_, it would seem that their rôle was not very important.\r\n\r\nThe Moslem church in India was not of the very fabric of empire. The\r\nimperial family and most of their associates in government adhered to it;\r\nbut it had no thorough control of education and justice, and no power\r\nto sanction war or pronounce the deposition of an emperor. It did not\r\ncurb the spirit of the nation or lay a heavy hand upon progress; but, as\r\nit was relatively unable to hinder by its weaknesses, so it could not\r\ncontribute its abiding strength. The Mogul Empire is but a memory. The\r\nMoslem church of India thrives and grows under the rule of aliens of\r\nanother faith.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOKS CONSULTED IN THE PREPARATION OF APPENDIX IV\r\n\r\nBADEN-POWELL, B. H.

SOURCES OF OTTOMAN GOVERNMENTAL IDEAS\r\n\r\nThree traceable lines of influence can be followed from the earliest\r\ntimes until their appearance in the Ottoman government of the sixteenth\r\ncentury. The oldest began in Egypt, and continued down through various\r\ndynasties until the Roman conquest, after which it began to enter the\r\nRoman imperial government. From this it passed to the Byzantine and\r\nthence to the Ottoman system. Locally again it followed a more direct\r\ncourse through the Fatimides and Mamelukes until the time of Selim I’s\r\nconquest of Egypt. The slave government of the Mamelukes offers an\r\ninteresting subject for comparison with the Ottoman Ruling Institution.\r\nIt would be superfluous to give references for this line of development,\r\nexcept perhaps to mention Sir William Muir’s book, _The Mameluke or Slave\r\nDynasty of Egypt_ (London, 1896), and Stanley Lane-Poole’s _Egypt in the\r\nMiddle Ages_ (London, 1901).\r\n\r\nThe second line, which seems to have contributed a greater number of\r\nelements, came down in the Bagdad-Euphrates valley through various\r\ngovernments to the Saracen and Seljuk empires, from which it passed to\r\nthe Ottomans. Here again no general references need be given. Perhaps\r\nthe most useful book in connection with the subject is D. B. McDonald’s\r\n_Moslem Theology, Jurisprudence, and Constitutional Theory_ (New York,\r\n1903).\r\n\r\nThe third and most direct line of influence is through the Tatars\r\nof the steppe lands. In A. H. Keane’s _Man, Past and Present_\r\n(Cambridge, England, 1899) there is a full and clear discussion of the\r\nanthropological relationships of the Turks. E. H. Parker’s _A Thousand\r\nYears of the Tartars_ (London, 1895) gives an account which is based\r\nclosely upon the Chinese sources, but which would be helped by the\r\naddition of as many of the two or three thousand notes which he did not\r\nprint as would show the sources of his information. The Chinese story\r\nof the great Tatar empire of the sixth century A.D. may be found in\r\nStanislas Julien’s _Documents Historiques sur les Tou-Kioue_ (Paris,\r\n1877). W. Radloff’s _Alttürkischen Inschriften der Mongolei_ (Leipsic,\r\n1894-95) discusses the earliest known Turkish monuments, which date\r\nfrom the eighth century. Emil Bretschneider’s _Medieval Researches from\r\nEastern Asiatic Sources_ (2 vols., London, 1888, new edition, 1910) gives\r\nan account of the Uigurs, whose greatness came in the eighth and ninth\r\ncenturies and whose name persisted until at least the twelfth century, as\r\nis shown by the oldest known Turkish book, which is in their dialect.\r\n\r\nThis old book has been printed, with original Syriac text,\r\ntransliteration into Roman characters, and German translation, by\r\nArminius (Hermann) Vambéry, under the title _Uigurische Sprachmonumente\r\nund das Kudatku Bilik_ (Innsbruck, 1870). The _Kudatku Bilik_, the\r\n“Wisdom that Blesses,” written at Kashgar in 1068 by Yusuf Khass Hajil,\r\nis really an “Art of Government,” composed for the instruction of a\r\nTurkish prince. It contains in rhymed couplets, arranged in chapters,\r\na large amount of advice on governmental matters, much of it being in\r\nthe form of proverbs. The book throws a great deal of light on the\r\nfundamental Ottoman character. Vambéry has also made a study, on a\r\nphilological basis, of the civilization of the Tatars, entitled _Die\r\nPrimitive Cultur des Türko-tatarischen Volkes_ (Leipsic, 1879).\r\n\r\nA book equally remarkable with the _Kudatku Bilik_ is the _Siasset\r\nNamèh_, written in 1092 for the Seljuk sultan Melek Shah by the great\r\nvizier Abu ’Ali al Hasan b. Ishaq (known better by his title, the Nizam\r\nal-Mulk), and printed in the original Persian, with a French translation,\r\nby Charles Schéfer, Paris, 1893. This “Book of Government” reveals to\r\nsome extent three things,—the methods of government of Sassanian times,\r\nthe actual government under Melek Shah, and the Seljuk government as\r\nthe Nizam al-Mulk would have it. It also sheds much light upon Ottoman\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nThe best general book on the Turks in Central Asia and their activities\r\ndown to the occupation of Asia Minor is undoubtedly Léon Cahun’s\r\n_Introduction à l’Histoire de l’Asie: Turcs et Mongols_ (Paris,\r\n1896). The same ground is covered briefly by Cahun in Lavisse and\r\nRambaud’s _Histoire Générale_, vol. ii. ch. xvi. There is a great\r\ndeal of information about the Persians and the Seljuk Turks in E. G.\r\nBrowne’s _Literary History of Persia_ (2 vols., London, 1902-1906).\r\nMaximilian Bittner has made a valuable study of the Turkish language,\r\nentitled _Der Einfluss des Arabischen und Persischen auf das Türkische_\r\n(Kaiserlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften, _Sitzungsberichte der\r\nPhilosophisch-Historischen Classe_, vol. cxlii. pt. iii. Vienna, 1900).\r\nSir W. M. Ramsay’s books are valuable for a study of the settlement\r\nof the Turks in Asia Minor, particularly his _Historical Geography of\r\nAsia Minor_ (London, 1890), _The Geographical Conditions determining\r\nHistory and Religion in Asia Minor_ (with comments by D. G. Hogarth, H.\r\nH. Howorth, and others, _Geographical Journal_, September, 1902, xx.\r\n257-282), and _Studies in the History and Art of the Eastern Provinces\r\nof the Roman Empire_ (Aberdeen, 1906). Volume V of H. F. Helmolt’s\r\n_Weltgeschichte_ (Leipsic, etc., 1905) is useful for its attempt to trace\r\nthe elements of Ottoman culture which were derived from Byzantine and\r\nother sources. William Miller’s _The Latins in the Levant_ (New York,\r\n1908) gives a clear picture of the confused and divided state of affairs\r\nto which the Ottomans put an end in their rough way.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE OTTOMAN GOVERNMENT IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\nAbundant material for a study of the sixteenth-century Ottoman government\r\nhas been provided and preserved; for the great place which the expanding\r\nempire held in the world developed an immense interest in its affairs\r\non the part of the West, and made it worth the while of many of its\r\nWestern residents to prepare descriptions of its outstanding features,\r\namong which its peculiar government was treated with special fulness.\r\nThe writings of these men of various Western nationalities are in a way\r\nmore helpful than a similar number of books from native writers would\r\nbe, because the foreigners could usually take nothing for granted,\r\nbut were compelled to draw a complete picture. They could not, on the\r\nother hand, get at the inner springs of the Ottoman activity as well\r\nas natives could; nor do any of them, with the exception of Menavino,\r\nseem actually to have read and known the Ottoman laws. Fortunately,\r\nOttoman historians began to write abundantly shortly before the reign of\r\nSuleiman. For Suleiman’s own time, the collections of his _Kanuns_ (since\r\nhe was noted as a legislator) contain much material which helps toward\r\nan understanding of his government; moreover, writers of a later date\r\nhave been drawn with special interest toward his reign, as the climax of\r\nOttoman greatness. At the same time, no one but Zinkeisen has attempted\r\nto give an extended account of the Ottoman government as it was in the\r\nsixteenth century.\r\n\r\nNo reasonably complete bibliography of books relating to Turkey has been\r\nmade. The following lists are worthy of mention as giving information in\r\nregard to the material for a study of Turkish history and institutions\r\nbefore the year 1600:—\r\n\r\nRichard Knolles gives a bare list of his authorities, to the number of\r\nabout twenty-five, at the beginning of his _Generall Historie of the\r\nTurkes_, London, 1603.\r\n\r\nJ. H. Boecler published at Bautzen in 1717 a _Commentarius\r\nHistorico-Politicus de Rebus Turcicis_, in which he gives, at pp. 14-41,\r\na list of 317 works on Turkish history and affairs, including 45 folio\r\nvolumes, 128 quartos, 98 octavos, and 45 duodecimos.\r\n\r\nJoseph von Hammer discusses his authorities in the preface to volume i\r\nof his _Geschichte des Osmanischen Reiches_ (Pest, 1827); and in volume\r\nx, pp. 57-336 (1835), he prints a list containing 3,025 titles of works\r\nrelating to Ottoman history which were to be found in Europe outside of\r\nConstantinople.\r\n\r\nAmat di San Filippo, in his _Biografia dei Viaggiatori Italiani_, etc. (2\r\nvols., Rome, 1882), gives accounts of many of the early Italian writers\r\non Turkish affairs.\r\n\r\nHenri Hauser, in his edition of Du Fresne-Canaye, described below (p.\r\n319), prints as Appendix II an _Essai d’une Bibliographie des Ouvrages\r\ndu XVIe Siècle relatifs au Levant_. The list, which does not pretend to\r\ncompleteness, contains about 60 different titles.\r\n\r\nThe catalogue of the library of Count Paul Riant, published in two parts\r\nat Paris in 1899, also contains the titles of a great number of books\r\nand pamphlets which relate to the subject under discussion. Most of this\r\nmaterial has been transferred to the Ottoman collection of the Library of\r\nHarvard University, through the generosity of Messrs. J. R. Coolidge and\r\nA. C. Coolidge,—a gift, it may be added, that has made the preparation\r\nof the present treatise possible. There are also many titles on early\r\nOttoman history in the catalogue of Charles Schéfer’s Oriental library\r\n(published at Paris in 1899), from which the same donors have contributed\r\n445 volumes to the Harvard Ottoman collection.\r\n\r\nThe list given in the _Cambridge Modern History_, i. 700-705, in\r\nconnection with Professor J. B. Bury’s chapter on “The Ottoman Conquest,”\r\nis fuller than most of those just mentioned. It omits some valuable\r\nauthorities, however, such as Schiltberger, Menavino, Ramberti, and\r\nBusbecq.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to get contemporaneous views of the Ottoman Empire at a\r\ndate earlier than the beginning of the sixteenth century, though they are\r\nall incomplete. The first accounts go back to the battle of Nicopolis\r\nin 1396. Froissart (_Chroniques_, ed. Lettenhove, xv. 319 ff., Brussels,\r\n1871), in a description of the battle and succeeding events which was\r\nbased on accounts given by Jacques du Fay and Jacques de Helly, gives\r\nsome idea of the Turkish army and the sultan. A better account for the\r\npresent purpose is that by Johann Schiltberger (translated into English\r\nby J. B. Telfer, and published by the Hakluyt Society as _The Bondage\r\nand Travels of Johann Schiltberger_, London, 1879). Schiltberger, then\r\na youth of sixteen, was taken prisoner at Nicopolis, and after serving\r\nas slave to Bayezid I for six years, was captured by Timur at the battle\r\nof Angora, 1402. He was retained as captive, not without important\r\nresponsibilities and wide journeys, for twenty-five years longer, when\r\nhe succeeded in escaping. It is a matter for regret that he says very\r\nlittle of his life at the sultan’s court, since he held a position which\r\ncorresponded to that of page in later times.\r\n\r\nAnother general account of the Turkish polity comes from the pen of\r\nBertrandon de la Broquière, first gentleman-carver (_écuyer tranchant_),\r\ncouncillor, and chamberlain of Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy. In the\r\ncourse of a trip through the Levant he met Murad II in Rumelia in 1433.\r\nHis observations show that many features of the Turkish system were then\r\nalready in operation,—as the four pashas, the slave system, the pages,\r\nthe imperial harem, the Janissaries (_Jehanicéres_), the feudal army, the\r\nDivan, etc. La Broquière’s memoirs are edited by Charles Schéfer, under\r\nthe title _Le Voyage d’Outremer_, as volume xii of _Recueil de Voyages et\r\nde Documents pour servir à l’Histoire de la Géographie depuis le XIIIe\r\njusqu’à la fin du XVIe Siècle_ (Paris, 1892). The same volume contains an\r\nopinion in regard to the military power of the Turks by Jehan Torzelo,\r\ndating from the year 1439.\r\n\r\nStill another report was written by a Transylvanian whose name remains\r\nunknown, but who was a slave in Ottoman private families from 1436 to\r\n1453. Evidently he had before his capture been a theological student\r\nwho held some of the ideas that preceded the Reformation movement. His\r\nbook had a great vogue after the year 1509, under various titles, such\r\nas: Ricoldus, _De Vita et Moribus Turcarum_, Paris, 1509 (the attachment\r\nto the name of Ricoldus is purely accidental); _Libellus de Ritu et\r\nMoribus Turcarum_, Wittenberg, 1530 (with a preface by Martin Luther);\r\nS. Frank, _Cronica-Abconterfayung_, etc., Augsburg, 1531; _Tractatus de\r\nMoribus_, etc. The Wittenberg edition has been used in this treatise,\r\nand is referred to as _Tractatus_. Although most of the book is\r\ntheological and argumentative, it affords a great deal of information.\r\nAmong other things, it contains what is probably the earliest mention of\r\nthe tribute children as the regular means of recruiting the Janissaries\r\n(_Ginnitscheri_).\r\n\r\nThe next good contemporary account of the Ottoman system is given in the\r\nhistory of Chal(co)condyles (written in Greek), of which there are many\r\neditions and translations. The one used here is the French translation,\r\n_Histoire de la Décadence de l’Empire Grec et Établissement de celui des\r\nTurcs_, Rouen, 1670. This writer, whose story comes down to 1465, speaks\r\nout of his own observation in describing the Ottoman camp and government.\r\n\r\nThe oldest authentic _Kanuns_ are in the _Kanun-nameh_ of Mohammed II,\r\nwhich is translated by Hammer in his _Staatsverfassung_ (Vienna, 1815),\r\n87-101.\r\n\r\nThe earliest book that was devoted to a description of Ottoman manners,\r\nreligion, and government is by Teodoro Spandugino Cantacusino. Born of\r\nan Italian father and a Greek mother, he spent his life alternately in\r\nthe East and the West. His book describes the empire as it was under\r\nBayezid II, who died in 1512, his information about the government being\r\nobtained from two very high renegade officials, probably Messih Pasha and\r\nHersek-Zadeh Ahmed Pasha. The earliest edition was printed in French at\r\nParis in 1519 under the title _Petit Traicté de l’Origine des Turcqz_;\r\nlater editions, with and without his name, or under the name of B.\r\nGycaud, bear the title _La Généalogie du Grant Turc à Présent Regnant_,\r\netc. The edition used here is a reprint of the first French issue, edited\r\nwith notes by C. Schéfer, Paris, 1896. This writer is sometimes quoted as\r\nSpandugino, and sometimes as Cantacusino. The first form is used in the\r\npresent treatise.\r\n\r\nA book that is even more valuable in some ways is Giovanni Antonio\r\nMenavino’s _Trattato de Costumi et Vita de Turchi_. The edition used\r\nhere was printed in Florence in 1548. Menavino came of a wealthy Genoese\r\nfamily. About the year 1505, when he was twelve years of age, handsome,\r\nbright, and well educated for his years, he was captured near Corsica\r\nby corsairs, and set aside as a gift suitable for the sultan. Taken to\r\nBayezid II, he pleased the old sultan greatly, and was placed at once\r\nin the school of pages, where, as his book shows throughout, he must\r\nhave profited greatly by the teaching that he received. He describes the\r\nreligion, customs, and government of the Ottomans in much detail. In 1514\r\nhe was taken by Selim I on the expedition against Persia; but he managed\r\nto escape to Trebizond, whence he made his way to Adrianople, Salonika,\r\nand thence home to Genoa.\r\n\r\nA group of excellent sources for studies of both the government and the\r\nhistory of the Ottoman Empire in the sixteenth century is found in the\r\nreports which the Venetian _Bailos_ and orators extraordinary presented\r\nto their Senate.\r\n\r\nVenice, says Ranke, “frequently sent her most experienced and able\r\ncitizens to foreign courts. Not content with the despatches on current\r\naffairs regularly sent home every fourteen days, she further required\r\nof her ambassadors, when they returned after an absence of two or three\r\nyears, that they should give a circumstantial account of the court and\r\nthe country they had been visiting.”[799] Since Constantinople was in\r\nthe sixteenth century the station of first importance in the Venetian\r\ndiplomatic service, it is safe to assume that the sons whom she sent\r\nthere were her most intelligent.\r\n\r\nA number of these Venetian reports, which do not, however, reach far\r\ninto Suleiman’s reign, are summarized by Marini Sanuto the Younger in\r\nhis voluminous _Diarii_, 1496-1533 (58 vols. in 59, Venice, 1879-1903).\r\nThe reports of Alvise Sagudino in 1496, and of Andrea Gritti in 1503,\r\nare quoted by Schéfer in the introduction to his edition of Spandugino’s\r\nwork, noticed above. Rinaldo Fulin, in his _Diarii e Diaristi Veneziani_\r\n(Venice, 1881) reprints Sanuto’s abstract of the Itinerary of Pietro\r\nZeno, orator at Constantinople in 1523.\r\n\r\nThe Venetian reports for the reign of Suleiman are all, so far as\r\npreserved and known, collected in the invaluable work of Eugenio Alberi,\r\n_Relazione degli Ambasciatori Veneti al Senato_ (15 vols., Florence,\r\n1839-1863). The three volumes of the third series (published 1840, 1844,\r\n1855, respectively), as well as a portion of the fifteenth volume or\r\nAppendix, are devoted to Turkish reports. Volume i of this series is\r\nalso separately printed as _Documenti di Storia Ottomana del Secolo XVI_\r\n(Florence, 1842). A few writings are included in these volumes which were\r\nnot reports to the Venetian senate.\r\n\r\nIn all, thirty-nine documents are thus presented, of which sixteen fall\r\nwithin the reign of Suleiman. Unfortunately there is a gap between the\r\nyears 1534 and 1553, a period for which there should be eight or ten\r\ndocuments of great value bearing on the Ottoman dealings with France,\r\nAustria, Spain, and Persia.\r\n\r\nThese volumes contain much helpful apparatus, such as a glossary of\r\nTurkish words (vol. i); notes on the Venetian embassies to the Porte in\r\nthe sixteenth century, with a list of the Venetian representatives (vol.\r\nii); biographical notes concerning the writers (all three volumes);\r\nchronological tables, genealogies, etc. (Appendix). The Venetians were\r\nparticularly interested in the financial side of the Ottoman government,\r\nits mechanism, its army, and its fleet. Many character descriptions\r\nof great personages enliven the pages. The last pages of the Appendix\r\ncontain a chronological index of the _Relazione_ and the other writings\r\nincluded; also an alphabetical list of them by authors, and chronological\r\nlists by countries. The subjoined list of reports from Constantinople\r\nis taken from page 435, and will serve as a means of locating many\r\nreferences in the foregoing pages. The more valuable reports are\r\ndistinguished by asterisks.\r\n\r\n\r\nVENETIAN REPORTS FROM CONSTANTINOPLE\r\n\r\nas given in Alberi’s _Relazione_, 3d series, 3 vols. and Appendix\r\n(Florence, 1840-1863)\r\n\r\n            Writer                Date  Volume    Page\r\n\r\n     Gritti, Andrea               1503    iii       1\r\n     Giustiniani, Antonio         1514     ”       45\r\n     Mocenigo, Alvise             1518     ”       53\r\n     Contarini, Bartolomeo        1519     ”       56\r\n     Minio, Marco                 1522     ”       69\r\n     Zen, Pietro                  1524     ”       93\r\n     Bragadino, Pietro            1526     ”       99\r\n     Minio, Marco                 1527     ”      113\r\n     Zen, Pietro                  1530     ”      119\r\n    *Ludovisi, Daniello           1534     i        1\r\n    *Navagero, Bernardo           1553     ”       33\r\n     _Anonimo_                      ”      ”      193\r\n    *Trevisano, Domenico          1554     ”      111\r\n    *Erizzo, Antonio              1557    iii     123\r\n    *Barbarigo, Antonio           1558     ”      145\r\n     Cavalli, Marino              1560     i      271\r\n     Dandolo, Andrea              1562    iii     161\r\n     Donini, Marcantonio           ”       ”      173\r\n    *Barbarigo, Daniele           1564    ii        1\r\n     Bonrizzo, Luigi              1565     ”       61\r\n     Ragazzoni, Jacopo            1571     ”       77\r\n    *Barbaro, Marcantonio         1573     i      299\r\n     Barbaro, Marcantonio          ”     Append.  387\r\n     Badoaro, Andrea               ”       i      347\r\n    *Garzoni, Costantino           ”       ”      369\r\n     Alessandri, Vincenzo        1574     ii      103\r\n     _Anonimo_                   1575      ”      309\r\n    *Tiepolo, Antonio            1576      ”      129\r\n    *Soranzo, Giacomo              ”       ”      193\r\n     Venier, Maffeo              1579      i      437\r\n     _Anonimo_                   1582     ii      209[800]\r\n     _Anonimo_                     ”       ”      427\r\n    Contarini, Paolo             1583     iii     209\r\n    *Morosini, Gianfrancesco     1585      ”      251\r\n     Michiel, Giovanni           1587     ii      255\r\n     Venier, Maffeo                ”       ”      295\r\n    *Moro, Giovanni              1590     iii     323\r\n    *Bernardo, Lorenzo           1592     ii      321\r\n    *Zane, Matteo                1594     iii     381\r\n\r\nAn interesting small pamphlet is the _Auszug eines Briefes ... das\r\nTürckich Regiment unn Wesen sey_, which was printed in a South-German\r\ndialect in 1526. It purports to be a letter from a German settled at\r\nAdrianople to his cousin in Germany, telling of his life as subject\r\nChristian under the sultan. The literary arrangement is so good, and the\r\nstatements diverge so uniformly toward the dark side, that this would\r\nseem to be a pamphlet written in Germany for the purpose of arousing\r\nalarm and activity after the battle of Mohacs.\r\n\r\nHieronymus Balbus, bishop of Gurk, published at Rome in 1526 a little\r\nbook of two essays addressed to Clement VII. The second part, “continens\r\nTurcarum Originem, Mores, Imperium,” etc., was also commended to the\r\nArchduke Ferdinand. The work makes up for a conspicuous lack of definite\r\nand accurate information by means of abundant scriptural and classical\r\nquotations and allusions, vituperation of the Turks, and assertion of\r\ntheir military ineffectiveness. It is chiefly valuable as an evidence of\r\nthe “Turkish fear.”\r\n\r\nA book that had a wide influence is _Turcicarum Rerum Commentarius_\r\naddressed by Paolo Giovio, or Paulus Jovius, bishop of Nocera, to Emperor\r\nCharles the Fifth, and dedicated at Rome in 1531. It was published in\r\nseveral languages; the edition used here is the Latin one, Paris, 1539.\r\nThe book is historical except for the last ten pages, which contain a\r\ndescription of the Ottoman government with particular reference to its\r\nmilitary resources. Giovio published also in two volumes at Florence, in\r\n1550-1552, _Historiarum sui Temporis Tomus Primus_ [_et Secundus_].\r\n\r\nV. D. Tanco, or Clavedan del Estanco, a Spanish gentleman, wrote in his\r\nnative tongue a book that was translated into Italian and published\r\nat Venice in 1558 under the title _Libro dell’ Origine et Successione\r\ndell’ Imperio de’ Turchi_. The basis of the work is the _Commentarius_\r\nof Jovius, just noticed; but this has been intelligently combined with\r\ninformation from Froissart, Aeneas Sylvius, and others. The latest date\r\nmentioned is 1537, and the death of Ibrahim in 1536 is not known.\r\n\r\nA very valuable and interesting work is the _Libri Tre delle Cose de\r\nTurchi_, etc., published by Aldus in Venice in 1539, and reprinted often\r\nthereafter. It appears also as one of the component parts of the work\r\npublished by Aldus in 1543, _Viaggi fatti da Vinetia, alla tana ...\r\nin Costantinopoli_, known sometimes simply as _Viaggi alla tana_, or\r\n“Travels to the Don.” The book appeared anonymously, but it has been\r\nattributed with much confidence to Benedetto Ramberti (see Alberi,\r\n_Relazione_, 3d series, iii. 8; _Archiv für Oesterreichische Geschichte_,\r\n1897, lxxxiii. 9; _Revue Critique_, 1896, i. 20-21). Ramberti accompanied\r\nLudovisi to and from Constantinople during the first six months of 1534.\r\nThe book was written in the same year; for it shows that Barbarossa was\r\nmade pasha while it was in process of composition (see above, Appendix\r\nI, p. 246, and, for the fact that Barbarossa was back in Algiers, May 9,\r\n1534, see Ursu, _La Politique Orientale de François I_, Paris, 1908, p.\r\n79), and in a long characterization at the close of the third book it\r\nrepresents Luigi (Alvise) Gritti, who was assassinated in Hungary late in\r\n1534, as still living.\r\n\r\nThe first book of the three describes the journey overland from Ragusa to\r\nConstantinople; the third book contains observations of no great value\r\non the power and policies of the Turks. The second book is the _pièce de\r\nrésistance_. It opens with a brief description of Constantinople and a\r\nrapid sketch of the origin and history of the Ottoman Turks. An account\r\nof the Turkish government follows, beginning with the inside service\r\nof the household of the sultan, proceeding to the outside service,\r\nthen taking up the chief officers of government, the Janissaries, the\r\n_Spahis_ of the Porte and the auxiliary branches of the army. The harem,\r\nthe palaces of the pages, the _Ajem-oghlans_, and the arsenal are next\r\ndescribed; then the feudal army is explained as it was constituted in\r\nEurope and in Asia; and, finally, a list of the sanjakates of the empire\r\nis given. The Italian used is fairly good, and the style is very simple,\r\noften degenerating to the mere cataloguing of officers. Throughout the\r\nbook the financial aspect of the government is emphasized strongly, the\r\nincomes of all persons mentioned being carefully stated. This second book\r\nof Ramberti is of so great importance to the present treatise that it is\r\ngiven in translation as Appendix I. The text used is that of the _Viaggi\r\n... alla tana_ (Venice, 1543).\r\n\r\nStanding in exceedingly close relationship to the second book of Ramberti\r\nis a twenty-two page pamphlet bearing the name of Junis Bey (Ionus Bei).\r\nWritten in broad Venetian dialect and printed on coarse paper in type of\r\na poor quality, not kept clean, it is in two portions, respectively of\r\neight and fourteen pages, which are distinguished by the use of larger\r\nand smaller type. The title-page bears the inscription “reprinted in\r\n1537.” The sixth page begins the list of pashas with the statement that\r\n“Ibrahim of Parga is dead,” and then gives the name of his successor in\r\nthe office of grand vizier. On the seventeenth page it is said that the\r\nterritories of the _Beylerbey_ of Mesopotamia “border” those of Bagdad\r\nwhich belong to Persia (Bagdad was taken by Suleiman in the winter of\r\n1535 and 1536); on the eighteenth occurs the remark that Alvise Gritti\r\n“says” such and such a thing; and at the close the book is attributed\r\nto “Ionus bei” and “Signor Aluise gritti.” Now, Junis Bey was in Venice\r\nfrom December 6, 1532, to January 9, 1533 (thesis of Theodore F. Jones,\r\np. 168, Harvard College Library); Gritti was assassinated in 1534; Junis\r\nBey was again in Venice from January 15 to February 17, 1537 (Jones,\r\n209). It seems reasonable to conclude, therefore, that the first edition\r\nof the pamphlet was printed at Venice in 1533 at the time of Junis Bey’s\r\nfirst visit, and that at the time of his second visit in 1537 the first\r\neight pages were recast with a few changes, and in certain unsold copies\r\nsubstituted for the older pages, the remainder being left as it stood\r\noriginally, despite the erroneous reference to Gritti.\r\n\r\nIt is very clear that Ramberti had before him while preparing his “second\r\nbook” a document almost identical with this pamphlet. Beginning with his\r\ndescription of the sultan’s household service, the order of treatment\r\nis practically the same, and even the words and phrases are often the\r\nsame, except for differences of dialect. His language frequently suggests\r\nthat he is expanding on some material before him. It is worthy of note,\r\nhowever, that not only Ramberti’s use of Italian, but also his use of\r\nTurkish, is frequently better than that of Junis Bey. Moreover, in\r\nhis list of officials he includes the _Mufti_ and the chief dragoman\r\n(_Terjuman_), whom Junis Bey leaves out, the latter omission being the\r\nmore remarkable in that Junis Bey held that office himself. On the\r\nother hand, where there are differences in numbers, Junis Bey is more\r\napt to be correct than Ramberti. It seems not unlikely that both works\r\nwere derived from a manuscript, more nearly complete and correct than\r\neither, in the possession of Alvise Gritti, which the latter allowed the\r\ntwo writers to use, Junis Bey probably in 1532 and Ramberti in 1534.\r\nAlvise Gritti was well known to both. Natural son of the doge Andrea\r\nGritti, he had won high favor with Ibrahim, who entrusted him with great\r\nresponsibilities. In fact, it may not be too bold a conjecture to suggest\r\nthat some of the information contained in his manuscript came from the\r\ncelebrated Grand Vizier himself. Aside from this possibility, a minute\r\nsurvey of the Ottoman government, prepared by Gritti himself or with\r\nhis collaboration, either for his own use or for the information of his\r\nkinsfolk the Venetians, possesses a presumption in favor of its accuracy\r\nand truthfulness. Accordingly the closing words, “all is true,” may be\r\naccepted with little reserve.\r\n\r\nThese two works, by Ramberti and Junis Bey, were much used by other\r\nwriters on Turkish affairs. Postel shows a close acquaintance with them,\r\nand Geuffroy frequently does little more than present a translation.\r\nRamberti was incorporated into a number of the collected works in regard\r\nto the Turks which appeared in various languages after the middle of the\r\nsixteenth century and thus entered into systematic histories. Since the\r\npamphlet of Junis Bey is very rare, its text is presented in Appendix II,\r\nabove. Besides matter very similar to that of Ramberti, it contains near\r\nthe end an account of the order of march of the sultan’s army when he\r\nwent to war.\r\n\r\nGuillaume Postel is perhaps the broadest-minded of the sixteenth-century\r\nobservers. He gives evidence of having had a legal training, and of\r\nhaving reflected along political and constitutional lines. Nicolay, in\r\nhis preface, informs us that Postel knew Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Chaldean,\r\nSyriac, and Arabic, as well as the principal Western languages. He\r\nwas sent by Francis I with the momentous embassy of La Forêt, and was\r\ntherefore in Constantinople about the year 1535. He seems to have made a\r\nlater visit for the purpose of acquiring manuscripts; but the substance\r\nof his book, as appears from numerous references, dates from the first\r\nvisit. The volume was printed at Poitiers in 1560, but was not published\r\ntill 1570. It contains three parts, separately paged:—\r\n\r\nI. _De la République des Turcs_; II. _Histoire et Considération de\r\nl’Origine, Loy, et Coustume des Tartares ... Turcs_, etc.; III. _La\r\nTierce Partie des Orientales Histoires, où est exposée la Condition,\r\nPuissance, & Revenue de l’Empire Turquesque_, etc. The first part gives,\r\namong other things, an excellent account of the page system and of\r\nOttoman law and justice. The third part is built upon the information in\r\nRamberti and Junis Bey; it describes the page system further, and adds a\r\ngood account of the _Ajem-oghlans_ and the Janissaries. By a reference it\r\nshows acquaintance with Giovio.\r\n\r\nAntoine Geuffroy, knight of St. John, issued in 1542 his _Briefve\r\nDescription de la Court du Grand Turc_. Four years later this was\r\npublished in English by R. Grafton under the title _The Order of the\r\nGreat Turcks Court of Hye Menne of War_; and from thirty to fifty years\r\nlater it appeared, combined with other material, in large volumes in the\r\nLatin and German tongues under the name of N. Honigerus or Haeniger,\r\nwith a Latin translation by G. Godelevæus, entitled _Aulae Turcicae,\r\nOthomannicique Imperii Descriptio_, etc. The work of Geuffroy thus had\r\na great vogue. It was a sound, intelligent description of the empire,\r\nbuilt upon the information in Ramberti and Junis Bey. By references and\r\nallusions it shows acquaintance with Froissart, Spandugino, and Giovio.\r\nThe references to Geuffroy in the foregoing pages are to the reprint in\r\nSchéfer’s edition of Jean Chesneau, described below.\r\n\r\nBartholomew Georgevitz, pilgrim to Jerusalem, issued a small book, _De\r\nTurcarum Moribus Epitome_, which passed through many editions in two or\r\nthree languages, the first dating not later than 1544, and the latest not\r\nearlier than 1629. The chapters are on various topics and from various\r\nsources. The first, on the rites and ceremonies of the Turks, is abridged\r\nfrom Spandugino. The second, on the Turkish soldiery, is by Georgevitz\r\nhimself; it is perhaps the most valuable, and shows by the age assigned\r\nto Prince Mustapha that it was written about 1537. The fourth chapter\r\ngives useful Turkish phrases, and is interesting as showing how Turkish\r\nwords were pronounced in the sixteenth century. The fifth chapter gives\r\na full account of the treatment of slaves of private citizens, written\r\nby one who had been a slave, apparently Georgevitz himself. The edition\r\nreferred to in this treatise was printed at Paris in 1566.\r\n\r\nJérome Maurand accompanied Captain Pinon on his mission to Constantinople\r\nin 1544. A few years later he wrote, in Italian, an account of his\r\njourney, which was translated by Léon Dorez as _Itinéraire de Jérome\r\nMaurand d’Antibes à Constantinople_, and published at Paris in 1901 as\r\nvol. xvii of _Recueil de Voyages_, etc.\r\n\r\nBefore 1549, Ibrahim Halebi, the jurist, prepared by command of Suleiman\r\nthe codification of the Sacred Law which bears the name of _Multeka\r\nol-ebhar_, and which formed the foundation of D’Ohsson’s great work.\r\n\r\nJean Chesneau went to Constantinople with D’Aramont, ambassador of Henry\r\nII of France, and accompanied him on Suleiman’s campaign against Persia\r\nin 1549. His narrative, which is not very illuminating or accurate, was\r\nedited by Charles Schéfer and published at Paris in 1887, under the\r\ntitle, _Le Voyage de Monsieur d’Aramon_, as vol. viii of _Recueil de\r\nVoyages_, etc. Bound in the same volume are five letters in the Italian\r\nlanguage, written from Constantinople in 1547 by the ambassador Veltwyck\r\nto Archduke Ferdinand of Austria; there is also (at pp. 227-248) a\r\nreprint in French of the first edition of Geuffroy.\r\n\r\nNicolas de Nicolay of Dauphiné, royal geographer and extensive\r\ntraveler, who wrote a book called _Discours et l’Histoire Véritable des\r\nNavigations, Pérégrinations et Voyages faicts en la Turquie_, is not\r\nthe least interesting of sixteenth-century authorities on Turkey. His\r\naccount of his voyage from Marseilles to Constantinople in the year 1551\r\nin the train of the Seigneur d’Aramont, ambassador of Henry II, and the\r\ndrawings from life with which he embellishes his book, show his capacity\r\nfor exact observation. In his descriptions of the customs and government\r\nof the Ottoman Empire, however, he does not reveal the possession of\r\nmuch first-hand information. Menavino is here his principal source of\r\nknowledge. The first edition of his book appeared at Lyons in 1567; it\r\nwas translated into several languages and reproduced often. An enlarged\r\nedition, published at Antwerp in 1586, is the one referred to in the\r\nforegoing pages. The plates in the book, about sixty in number, have been\r\nsaid to be the work of Titian; but this is apparently incorrect, for\r\nthe preface merely states that Nicolay drew from life on the spot and\r\nafterwards had the drawings reproduced “_avec fraiz & labeur incroyable_.”\r\n\r\nFrom a literary point of view, Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq is by all odds\r\nthe most interesting of sixteenth-century sources for the study of\r\nOttoman history and government. The charm of his style should not obscure\r\nthe facts that he was a keen and exact observer possessed of a true\r\nscientific spirit, and that he reflected carefully on what he saw. He\r\nwrote on Turkey during his period of service as ambassador from Charles\r\nV to Suleiman between 1555 and 1562. One of his four Turkish letters was\r\nprinted in Antwerp in 1581, and since that time at least twenty-seven\r\neditions and reprints have appeared in seven languages. The edition of\r\nhis _Life and Letters_, in two volumes, translated from the original\r\nLatin by C. T. Forster and F. H. B. Daniell (London, 1881), has been\r\nused in this treatise, as has also his _De Re Militari contra Turcam\r\ninstituenda Consilium_, as printed in a complete edition of his writings\r\npublished at Pest in 1758, pp. 234-277.\r\n\r\nPhilippe Du Fresne-Canaye, a young Huguenot gentleman, was sent by his\r\nfamily to Venice for safety in the troubled days after the massacre of\r\nSt. Bartholomew; and he took advantage of his nearness to the Levant\r\nto visit Constantinople in 1573. He had prepared himself for his visit\r\nby reading Ramberti, Postel, Nicolay, and others, but he does not seem\r\nto have learned much that was not in those authorities. His _Voyage du\r\nLevant_ was edited for publication in Paris in 1897 by Henri Hauser, as\r\nvol. xvi of _Recueil de Voyages_, etc. Hauser’s Appendix II contains the\r\nbibliography of sixteenth-century works relating to the Levant which is\r\nmentioned above (p. 308).\r\n\r\nThe _Kanun-nameh_ of Suleiman, collected by the _Mufti_ Ebu su’ud, who\r\ndied in 1574, contained a number of the Sultan’s _Kanuns_ relating\r\nmainly to financial and feudal matters. A translation of the incomplete\r\ntable of contents of the Turkish manuscript copy of this _Kanun-nameh_\r\n(which is in the Imperial Library at Vienna, Fluegel No. 1816) is given\r\nabove as Appendix III. Many of the _Kanuns_ are translated in Hammer’s\r\n_Staatsverfassung_, pp. 396-424, where they are erroneously attributed to\r\nAchmet I.\r\n\r\nA little anonymous book, _The Policy of the Turkish Empire_, published\r\nat London in 1597, contains an interesting preface. The remainder of\r\nthe book deals only with the Turkish religion, and is drawn mainly from\r\nMenavino, with some incorporation from Spandugino and Georgevitz.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of Richard Knolles’s _Generall Historie of the Turkes_\r\n(London, 1603), is to be found “A Briefe Discourse of the Greatnesse of\r\nthe Turkish Empire,” written probably in the year of publication, since\r\nthe story comes down to the accession of Achmet I in 1603. The lands\r\nof the empire, “of all others now upon earth farre the greatest,” are\r\ndescribed, its revenues are set forth, the Timariotes, the Janissaries,\r\nthe chief officers of state, and the fleet receive notice, and the\r\nTurkish power is compared with that of all states which touch its\r\nfrontiers. It is to this part of Knolles’s work (as printed in the 6th\r\nedition of his History, with Ricaut’s continuation, London, 1687, ii.\r\n981-990) that most of the references in the foregoing pages are made.\r\n\r\nPietro Della Valle, known as Il Pellegrino, or The Pilgrim, wrote _Viaggi\r\n... in la Turchia, la Persia, e l’India_, which was published in two\r\nvolumes (four parts) at Rome in 1658-1663. He was in Constantinople\r\nin 1614 and 1615, and took advantage of every opportunity to witness\r\na ceremony. Observant of costumes and jewels, he could not esteem the\r\nTurkish officials highly, because they were all slaves. The references in\r\nthis treatise are to the second edition of the first part, published in\r\n1662.\r\n\r\nMany collections based on the above-mentioned writings and on others were\r\nissued after the middle of the sixteenth century, and many surveys of the\r\nOttoman Empire were prepared as time went on. Of the latter, three stand\r\nforth as of sufficient importance to throw light on sixteenth-century\r\nconditions:—\r\n\r\nSir Paul Ricaut, a resident of Turkey for many years, issued late in the\r\nseventeenth century _The History of the Present State of the Ottoman\r\nEmpire_. He explains that he obtained his information from Turkish\r\nrecords from high officials, from members of the Ulema, and from a Pole\r\nwho had passed through the school of pages and had spent nineteen years\r\nin all at the Ottoman court. Ricaut was evidently a student of political\r\nphilosophy; he seems to have relied especially upon Tacitus, the civil\r\nlaw, Machiavelli, and Lord Bacon. His book was printed in several\r\nlanguages, has been much quoted since, and deserves the fame it received.\r\nThe sixth English edition, published in London in 1686, is used here. The\r\nbook is also printed at the end of the second volume of his edition of\r\nKnolles’s _Turkish History_, London, 1687.\r\n\r\nIgnatius Mouradgea D’Ohsson, born in Turkey and long a resident there,\r\nprepared between 1788 and 1818 his great _Tableau Général de l’Empire\r\nOthoman_. He based his work on the _Multeka ol-ebhar_ (see above, p. 318)\r\nwhich with its comments he rearranged and translated, adding to it a\r\ngreat many observations of his own. The book appeared in two forms, the\r\nhuge folio edition being a magnificent example of the bookmaker’s art.\r\nThe smaller edition of the book (7 vols., Paris, 1788-1824) has been used\r\nhere. The last three volumes were published under the supervision of his\r\nson after his death. Six of the seven volumes are based on the _Multeka_;\r\nthe seventh contains a full description of the government, including the\r\ncourt, the ministers, the bureaus, the army, etc.\r\n\r\nJoseph von Hammer published at Vienna, in 1815, _Des Osmanischen Reichs\r\nStaatsverfassung und Staatsverwaltung_, in two volumes. The former is\r\nvery largely a collection of documents, such as _Kanuns_, _fetvas_, and\r\nextracts from the _Multeka_. A large amount of valuable material is\r\npresented; but it is only partly digested, and the author often does not\r\nindicate clearly whence he drew his extracts. The second volume goes\r\nover much the same ground as D’Ohsson’s seventh volume. Another work\r\nof Hammer’s, his _Geschichte des Osmanischen Reiches_ (10 vols., Pest,\r\n1827-1835), has furnished the historical background for this treatise.\r\nThis work is extremely valuable from the fact that it is based upon\r\nnumerous inaccessible Turkish sources; but it is largely uncritical, and\r\nit does not make sufficient use of Western authorities.\r\n\r\nLeopold Ranke published at Hamburg in 1827 the first volume of his\r\nexcellent work, _Fürsten und Völker von Sud-Europa_. He was the first to\r\ndiscern the value of the Venetian reports, and by their aid he reached\r\nfar greater accuracy than had yet been attained in attempts to describe\r\nthese great South-European empires when at the height of their power. The\r\nEnglish translation by W. K. Kelly, entitled _The Ottoman and the Spanish\r\nEmpires in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries_ (London, 1843), has\r\nbeen used in the present treatise.\r\n\r\nThe third volume of J. W. Zinkeisen’s _Geschichte des Osmanischen Reiches\r\nin Europa_ (Gotha, 1855) has been used for its discussion of the Ottoman\r\ngovernment in the sixteenth century. It is based too exclusively on\r\nthe Venetian reports, which Zinkeisen seems to have regarded as always\r\ntrustworthy, and it makes little or no use of Turkish sources.\r\n\r\nStanley Lane-Poole, in his _Story of Turkey_, London, 1886, chapters\r\nxiv and xvi, gives a very good summary of the structure of the Ottoman\r\nhousehold and administration, condensed from D’Ohsson’s seventh volume.\r\n\r\nIn Lavisse and Rambaud’s _Histoire Générale_, iv. 747 ff., there is a\r\nbrief account, by Rambaud, of the organization of the Ottoman Empire in\r\ngeneral. Though not accurate in every respect, it gives, on the whole, an\r\nexcellent picture.\r\n\r\nA. Heidborn published at Vienna and Leipsic in 1909 a careful,\r\nwell-planned, and extremely valuable work entitled _Manuel de Droit\r\nPublic et Administratif de l’Empire Ottoman_. Although the principal\r\npurpose of the book is to explain present-day conditions, the historical\r\nbackground is outlined at many points. Unfortunately there is neither\r\ntable of contents nor index; but perhaps these will be supplied when the\r\nwork is extended farther. The chapters of the present volume deal with\r\nthe territory of the state, the sources and fundamental principles of\r\nthe legislation in force in the Ottoman Empire, the head of the state,\r\nnationality, the administrative organization, and justice. The chapter on\r\njustice occupies more than half the book, and treats fully the judicial\r\norganization, civil and criminal law, and procedure.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the works described above, the appended alphabetical list\r\ncontains the names of a few authors whose works, though occasionally\r\nquoted in this treatise, call for no special comment; and also the names\r\nof a number of writers who have dealt with the government of Turkey, but\r\nwho have not been quoted because their information either is of secondary\r\nimportance or derivation, or deals with a later time, when conditions had\r\nbeen changed.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.

Balbus gives an idea\r\nhow difficult it was to reach a definite opinion: “Some count the Turks\r\namong the Asiatic Sarmatians, and say that they were expelled by their\r\nneighbors from the Caspian mountains into Persia, and descended into\r\nAsia Minor. Others, following the name, perhaps, think that this people\r\nhad its beginning in Turce, a great and opulent city of the Persians.\r\nOthers consider them the progeny of the Parthians. Some think the Turks\r\nhad their origin in Arabia, and some in Syria. But it is more likely that\r\nthey were Scythians by origin, and (as we said above) from the foot of\r\nMount Caucasus, and that they formerly inhabited vast deserts.” See also\r\nKnolles, 1-2.\r\n\r\n[3] Keane, _Man, Past and Present_, 268, 314-315. Holdich (in\r\n_Encyclopaedia Britannica_, 11th ed., ii. 749 b) says, “As ethnographical\r\ninquiry advances the Turk appears to recede from his Mongolian affinities\r\nand to approach the Caucasian.” Keene (_Turks in India_, 1 ff.) is\r\ninclined to consider the Turks a mere mixture of Mongols with Caucasians.\r\nSo bald a theory does not account for the group of Turkish languages.\r\n\r\n[4] Keane, 267.\r\n\r\n[5] _Ibid._ 317.\r\n\r\n[6] _Ibid._ 322; Hammer, _Geschichte_, i. 3.\r\n\r\n[7] Keane, 322; Hammer, _Geschichte_, i. 2; etc.\r\n\r\n[8] Hammer, _Geschichte_, i. 1. This fact, known to Knolles (p. 2),\r\nseems to have escaped the attention of Sir Charles Eliot (_Encyclopaedia\r\nBritannica_, 11th ed., xxvii. 470 d).\r\n\r\n[9] The older view, that Iran represented peoples of Indo-European stock,\r\nand Turan peoples of Ural-Altaic stock, though once so generally adopted\r\nas to sanction the bestowal of the names Iranian and Turanian upon these\r\ngroups of peoples, has been abandoned as regards the original legends,\r\nin which Turan seems to have represented ruder tribes of Indo-European\r\nlineage (Meyer, _Geschichte_, i. pt. ii. 814-815). But the Greeks\r\nfrom their first acquaintance with the name identified Turan with the\r\nScythians, and at about the same time the Persians began to apply it to\r\nthe Northern peoples of alien stock. The conditions of frontier contact\r\nbetween Turks and Persians during many centuries were undoubtedly as\r\ndescribed in the legends.\r\n\r\n[10] Rawlinson, _Parthia_, 33-35; Keane, 319. Meyer (in _Encyclopaedia\r\nBritannica_, 11th ed., xxi. 214 c) regards the Parni or Aparni, who\r\nbecame the conquering tribe in Parthia, as Iranian nomads; but Peisker\r\n(in _Cambridge Medieval History_, i. 332) asserts that the nomads of the\r\nAsiatic background all belong to the Altaian branch of the Ural-Altaian\r\nrace. The fact that the Parthian army was a slave army (see Meyer,\r\nas above, 217 a) is perhaps the strongest piece of evidence that the\r\noriginal Parthians were Turks.\r\n\r\n[11] Keane, 327. Asia Minor is here used in the larger sense, as denoting\r\nin general the Asian territory which lies west of a line drawn from the\r\neastern end of the Black Sea to the head of the Gulf of Alexandretta.\r\n\r\n[12] Quoted in Keane, 328, from Gibbon (ed. Bury), vi. 250.\r\n\r\n[13] Vambéry, _Die Primitive Cultur_, 47; Keane, 328; Cahun,\r\n_Introduction_, 169 ff.; Ramsay, _Studies in Eastern Roman Provinces_,\r\n295.\r\n\r\n[14] Ramsay, _Studies in Eastern Roman Provinces_, 297. This statement\r\nhas been confirmed by conversation with other persons well acquainted\r\nwith conditions in Asia Minor. See also E. Huntington, in _National\r\nGeographic Magazine_, September, 1910, p. 767.\r\n\r\n[15] Vambéry (_Die Primitive Cultur_, 47) expresses the opinion that the\r\nOttomans never received, all told, more than 25,000 men of Turkish blood.\r\n\r\n[16] _Ottoman_ is an attempt to pronounce _Othman_ by those who pronounce\r\n_th_ like _t_; _Osman_ a similar attempt by those who pronounce _th_ (as\r\nin “thin”) like _s_.\r\n\r\n[17] Hammer, _Geschichte_, i. 42-43.\r\n\r\n[18] Keane, 268, 316. Peschel, 380, says, “The Turks of the west have\r\nso much Aryan and Semitic blood in them that the last vestiges of their\r\noriginal physical characters have been lost, and their language alone\r\nindicates their previous descent.” On the other hand, E. Huntington (in\r\n_National Geographic Magazine_, September, 1910, p. 767) expresses the\r\nopinion that the inhabitants of the central part of the plateau of Asia\r\nMinor are “almost purely Turkish in race.” He does not say, however, that\r\nthis opinion is based on observation of physical appearances.\r\n\r\n[19] Hammer, _Geschichte_, i. 59.\r\n\r\n[20] Keene, 2, makes the interesting suggestion that this custom,\r\nfollowed _mutatis mutandis_ by the Moguls of India, was a survival of\r\nexogamous conditions among the ancestors of the Turks.\r\n\r\n[21] The twentieth power of 1/2 is 1/1,148,576. The description\r\ngiven of Orchan, furthermore, shows scarcely a discernible trace of\r\nMongolian ancestry. Compare Hammer, _Geschichte_, i. 158: “Mit demselben\r\n[Osman] waren ihm zwar die Bocksnase und die schön gewölbten schwarzen\r\nAugenbrauen gemein; aber er hatte blonde Haare und lichte Augen, die\r\nStatur und die Stirne hoch, die Brust breit, die Faust kräftig wie die\r\nKlaue des Löwen, das Gesicht rund und die Farbe desselben weiss und roth;\r\nder Körperbau stark, der Bart und Knebelbart dicht und wohlgenährt.”\r\nMurad II showed a little more evidence of Tatar descent. He “is,” says\r\nLa Broquière, 181, “a man of stout build and short body, and he has\r\nsomething of the broad face of a Tatar’s physiognomy, and he has a rather\r\nlarge hooked nose and rather small eyes, and he is very brown in the\r\nface, and he has plump cheeks and a round beard.”\r\n\r\n[22] Keane, 266.\r\n\r\n[23] Compare the election of Sebuktegin, in Schéfer’s edition of the\r\n_Siasset Namèh_, 158.\r\n\r\n[24] Cahun, _Introduction_, 79.\r\n\r\n[25] Vambéry, _Uigurische Sprachmonumente und das Kudatku Bilik_, 118.\r\nThis passage closely resembles the words attributed to Artaxerxes\r\nI, first king of the Sassanian Persian line: “There can be no power\r\nwithout an army, no army without money, no money without agriculture,\r\nand no agriculture without justice” (Rawlinson, _Seventh Great Oriental\r\nMonarchy_, i. 61).\r\n\r\n[26] Hammer, _Staatsverfassung_, 36-45.\r\n\r\n[27] _Ibid._ 36.\r\n\r\n[28] Quoted by Cahun, in Lavisse and Rambaud, iii. 964.\r\n\r\n[29] Schéfer, _Siasset Namèh_, 139.\r\n\r\n[30] Bérard, 4 ff.\r\n\r\n[31] Hammer, _Staatsverfassung_, 30; D’Ohsson, v. 7; Heidborn, 111.\r\n\r\n[32] D’Ohsson, i. 291; Hammer, _Staatsverfassung_, 32.\r\n\r\n[33] D’Ohsson, vi. 253.\r\n\r\n[34] _Ibid._ v. 53.\r\n\r\n[35] _Ibid._ 109.\r\n\r\n[36] _Ibid_. iv. 280; Busbecq, _Life and Letters_, i. 331; Erizzo, 137.\r\n\r\n[37] This was based upon a passage of the Koran, “Sedition is worse\r\nthan execution” (Sura 2: 187): Hammer, _Geschichte_, i. 216. Professor\r\nG. F. Moore points out that in this passage (and in Sura 2: 214, which\r\nis substantially identical) the text refers to Mohammed’s war with the\r\nMeccans, or to fighting in the sacred months. The word _fitnah_, here\r\ntranslated “sedition,” has various meanings: first of all, “trial,” as\r\ngold and silver, for example, are tried by smelting; then, “successful\r\ntemptation, leading or turning a man astray, error, discord, dissension,\r\nsedition, etc.” The context indicates clearly that Mohammed had in mind\r\nthe leading or turning of people from the true religion as that which\r\nis “worse than killing.” The other meanings would, however, allow some\r\naccommodating jurist or theologian to make this a plausible proof-text\r\nfor authorizing the killing of the sultan’s brothers, who might become\r\nseditious or furnish cause for dissension.\r\n\r\n[38] Hammer, _Staatsverfassung_, 31.\r\n\r\n[39] _Ibid._ 32; D’Ohsson, vii. 150.\r\n\r\n[40] Hammer, _Geschichte_, iii. 478, and _Staatsverfassung_, 340.\r\n\r\n[41] For the Tartar method of raiding in the seventeenth century, see\r\nRicaut, book i. ch. xiii. This may be compared with Turkish methods in\r\nthe fifteenth century, as described by the author of the _Tractatus_, ch.\r\nv.\r\n\r\n[42] D’Ohsson, v. 50. Orthodoxy in the Moslem religion was by no means an\r\ninsuperable obstacle to attempts at conquest. The Mamelukes whom Selim I\r\noverthrew were Sunnites, and Malekite Morocco was long a land coveted by\r\nthe Ottomans. A desire for the unification of orthodox Islam came into\r\nplay here.\r\n\r\n[43] D’Ohsson, v. 86.\r\n\r\n[44] The Turks laid claim also to Morocco, but they never exercised\r\nabiding authority there: Knolles (ed. 1687), 987.\r\n\r\n[45] Hammer, _Geschichte_, ii. 520-521.\r\n\r\n[46] These are given in detail in Hammer’s _Staatsverfassung_, 219-327.\r\n\r\n[47] _Ibid._ 251 (_Kanun-nameh_ of the _sanjak_ of Kurdistan).\r\n\r\n[48] Hammer, _Geschichte_, iii. 478, and _Staatsverfassung_, 343 ff.;\r\nHeidborn, 320 ff.\r\n\r\n[49] Hammer, _Staatsverfassung_, 344.\r\n\r\n[50] D’Ohsson, vii. 372 ff.; Hammer, _Geschichte_, iii. 475 ff., and\r\n_Staatsverfassung_, 337 ff.\r\n\r\n[51] Hammer, _Staatsverfassung_, 345.\r\n\r\n[52] _Ibid._ 347.\r\n\r\n[53] _Ibid._ 344.\r\n\r\n[54] D’Ohsson, v. 96.\r\n\r\n[55] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[56] Belin, _La Propriété Foncière_, 88 ff.\r\n\r\n[57] Hammer, _Geschichte_, iii. 476; D’Ohsson, vii. 374.\r\n\r\n[58] D’Ohsson, ii. 523 ff., especially 552-557.\r\n\r\n[59] Belin, _La Propriété Foncière_, 104 ff.\r\n\r\n[60] Ricaut, 112.\r\n\r\n[61] Bernardo, 387 (“like a mine of slaves for the service of the\r\nTurks”); Ricaut, 123; Chardin, 85, 90 (“sometimes they will sell their\r\nown children”), 94, 114, 192. It is said that the practice of raising\r\nCircassian girls for sale is still carried on in Asia Minor (Heidborn,\r\n81).\r\n\r\n[62] Ricaut, 138; Postel, iii. 71; Nicolay, 10 (“The most of those who\r\nare called Turks in Algiers, whether in the king’s household, or on\r\nthe galleys, are Christians of all nations who have denied their faith\r\nand turned Mohammedan—sont Chrestiens reniez et Mahumetizez de toutes\r\nnations”); Lavisse and Rambaud, iv. 816, 820.\r\n\r\n[63] Nicolay, 83. Jorga, iii. 167-189, has taken note of the ancestry of\r\nmany of the high Turkish officials of the sixteenth century; he finds no\r\nRoumanian among them.\r\n\r\n[64] In regard to the Armenians, see Schiltberger, 73; Chalcocondyles,\r\n53. As to both Armenians and Jews, see Navagero, 42; Postel, i. 34.\r\nMorosini, 294, makes mention of an Armenian who was in 1585 the\r\n_Beylerbey_ of Greece by special favor of the Sultan.\r\n\r\n[65] Pélissié du Rausas, i. 21-22.\r\n\r\n[66] D’Ohsson, v. 104. Visiting foreigners (_muste emin_) who might\r\nremain more than one year became tributary subjects (_zimmi_): Belin, _La\r\nPropriété Foncière_, 57.\r\n\r\n[67] For the times when these different “communities” were formed within\r\nthe Ottoman state, see Steen de Jehay, _passim_. In brief, the Greek\r\ncommunity was organized in 1453 and the Armenian in 1461. The latter was\r\nat first supposed to include all subjects who were not Moslem or Greek\r\nOrthodox; those who were not Gregorian Armenians were gradually separated\r\noff by a process of differentiation which may be said to be active still.\r\nWith the growth of the spirit of nationalism in the nineteenth century,\r\nthe Greek Orthodox community has also been divided.\r\n\r\n[68] Hammer, _Geschichte_, ii. 237.\r\n\r\n[69] See Jorga, iii. 167 ff., especially 174, 188.\r\n\r\n[70] Gritti, 24-25.\r\n\r\n[71] A. Barbarigo, 149-150 (from a summary of his _Relazione_).\r\n\r\n[72] Barbaro, 315-329, _passim_.\r\n\r\n[73] Morosini, 263-267, _passim_.\r\n\r\n[74] Bernardo, 358-364, _passim_.\r\n\r\n[75] Zane, 389.\r\n\r\n[76] _Ibid._, 414.\r\n\r\n[77] Knolles (ed. 1687), 982.\r\n\r\n[78] Ricaut, 14-15.\r\n\r\n[79] These _Spahis_ of the Porte are to be distinguished from the body of\r\nfeudal _Spahis_. See below, pp. 98-105.\r\n\r\n[80] This is illustrated by the quotations in the last section of Chapter\r\ni, above. See also Menavino, 138 (referring to the pages, he says “Tutti\r\nsono suoi schiaui & figlioli Christiani”); Ricaut, 14 (all who receive\r\npay or office from the sultan are called _kul_); D’Ohsson, vii. 203 (“Les\r\nemployés civils de même que les militaires, suivant l’antique usage de\r\nl’Orient, sont assimilés aux esclaves du Souverain, et qualifiés de ce\r\nnom—coul—dans toutes les pièces publiques”). In D’Ohsson’s time the term\r\nhad acquired such a general usage as in the English phrase “your obedient\r\nservant.” Della Valle, i. 44, speaking of the entry to the Divan, says,\r\n“Tutti sono schiavi;” and Ranke, 9, says, “All were slaves.”\r\n\r\n[81] D’Ohsson, vii. 149, 207.\r\n\r\n[82] For example, Lodge, _The Close of the Middle Ages_ (1906), 500;\r\nMyers, _Medieval and Modern History_ (1905), 165.\r\n\r\n[83] The _Tractatus_, ch. viii, says simply 20 years and under; Zeno,\r\n128, says above 10 years. Ramberti and Junis Bey (below, pp. 244, 263)\r\nmention pages from 8 to 20 years old; Navagero, 49, says between 12 and\r\n15 years, Trevisano, 229, says that they were taken not at the age of\r\n6 or 7 years as formerly, but at 10 or 12 years. Postel, iii. 23, sets\r\nbetween 12 and 14 as the lower limit, and 18 and 20 as the upper limit.\r\nNicolay, 62, says that the pages were from 8 to 20 years of age; Garzoni,\r\n396, says that they ranged from the tenth to the thirteenth year;\r\nRicaut, 74, fixes the age at 10 or 12 years. Too much reliance should\r\nnot be placed on Trevisano’s statement as to former times, since hearsay\r\nevidence as to Turkish affairs is unreliable. Considering the rougher\r\nlife in earlier times, it is likely that levies would then have been made\r\nof older, rather than younger, boys. The presence of young boys among the\r\npages was due to the selection of unusually promising captives.\r\n\r\n[84] Myers (as above) mentions the two methods of capture and tribute as\r\nsuccessive.\r\n\r\n[85] Djevad Bey, i. 26: “Ces prisonniers ou esclaves étaient d’ailleurs\r\nincorporés dans l’armée des Janissaires, et alors l’effectif qui manquait\r\nétait complété par la voie de la levée de troupes parmi les sujets\r\nchrétiens.”\r\n\r\n[86] Ramberti and Junis Bey (below, pp. 254, 270) say that 10,000, or\r\n12,000 were taken every 4 years. Geuffroy, 242, and Postel, iii. 23,\r\ngive the same estimate. Ricaut, 74, says he is “given to understand”\r\nthat about 2000 were collected yearly in the middle of the seventeenth\r\ncentury. The exigencies of war probably increased the number greatly at\r\ntimes. Bérard, 12, naming no authority, says that in some years Suleiman\r\ntook 40,000 boys.\r\n\r\n[87] 20,000 _Ajem-oghlans_, 12,000 to 14,000 Janissaries, 10,000 of the\r\nauxiliary corps, grooms, etc., 40,000 _Spahis_ of the Porte (including\r\nthe 12,000 members of the four corps and the followers they were obliged\r\nto bring), 2000 pages and high officials. Suleiman took with him on his\r\nlast campaign 48,316 men under pay (Hammer, _Staatsverwaltung_, 181).\r\nMorosini, 259, says that in 1585 the sultan had under pay 80,000 men.\r\nThis is exclusive of about one-half of the _Ajem-oghlans_.\r\n\r\n[88] Postel, i. 20.\r\n\r\n[89] See below, p. 69, note 3.\r\n\r\n[90] Postel, iii. 36.\r\n\r\n[91] See below, p. 99, note 1.\r\n\r\n[92] For example, Piri Mohammed, a descendant of the thirteenth-century\r\npoet, Jelal ad-din Rumi. Cf. Hammer, _Geschichte_, iii. 18.\r\n\r\n[93] Notably Junis Bey, who says (below, p. 265), “None can be a\r\npasha except a Christian renegade.” This custom is said to have been\r\nestablished by Bayezid II (Angiolello, 74, quoted by Jorga, ii. 306, note\r\n2). For further instances, see the last section of Chapter i, above.\r\n\r\n[94] See above, p. 33.\r\n\r\n[95] D’Ohsson, v. 91.\r\n\r\n[96] Schiltberger, 5, gives an early example. See also _Tractatus_, ch.\r\nviii.\r\n\r\n[97] Hammer, _Geschichte_, i. 167.\r\n\r\n[98] Zeno, 127.\r\n\r\n[99] Zeno is strongly impressed by these two sources.\r\n\r\n[100] Postel, iii. 17-18. It was in this way that Menavino entered the\r\nsystem (see his _Trattato_, 10).\r\n\r\n[101] Cf. Postel, iii. 23.\r\n\r\n[102] A study of the nationality of the high officials of the\r\nsixteenth century gives evidence of this. For example, Ibrahim was an\r\nAlbanian (Junis Bey, below, p. 265); Rustem Pasha was a Croat (Hammer,\r\n_Geschichte_, iii. 268); Ferhad was a Hungarian (_ibid._ 365); the grand\r\nvizier Ali, whom Busbecq (_Life and Letters_, i. 157) calls “a thorough\r\ngentleman,” was a Dalmatian; Ayas was an Albanian, and Kassim a Croat\r\n(Junis Bey, p. 265); etc. For many other examples, see Jorga, iii.\r\n167-189.\r\n\r\n[103] The _Tractatus_, ch. viii, says every 5 years; Spandugino, 102,\r\nsays once in 5 years or oftener; Zeno, 128, says each year; Ramberti and\r\nJunis Bey (below, pp. 254, 270) say every 4 years; Postel, iii. 22, says\r\nevery 3 or 4 years.\r\n\r\n[104] _Tractatus_, ch. vi.\r\n\r\n[105] Giovio, _Commentarius_, 75; Zeno, 128; Nicolay, 83. Jorga,\r\niii. 188, finds no Roumanian among the high Turkish officials of the\r\nsixteenth century. Roumania, being a vassal state, was not exposed to\r\nthe _devshurmeh_. Knolles (ed. 1687, pp. 984-985) says that the tribute\r\nboys from Asia were not advanced to become Janissaries, because they were\r\nnot of sufficiently high quality. They are not found in positions of\r\nprominence.\r\n\r\n[106] Navagero, 48.\r\n\r\n[107] Menavino’s translator says _quasi decimatione_ (Lonicerus, i.\r\n140). Postel, iii. 22-23, says expressly that the children were not\r\ntithed; Nicolay, 83, however, states that one in three were taken, as\r\ndoes J. Soranzo, 245. Morosini, 264, speaks of a tithe (_decima_).\r\nGibbon (ed. Bury), vii. 79, says that a fifth of the boys were taken;\r\nsee also Lavisse and Rambaud, iv. 758. The latter statements seem to be\r\nbased theoretically on the fifth of the captives to which the sultan was\r\nentitled. The differences among those who profess to fix a proportion are\r\nevidence that there was none.\r\n\r\n[108] Spandugino, 103.\r\n\r\n[109] Postel, iii. 22. Navagero, 49, says that the officers summoned the\r\nheads of families and commanded them to present their sons.\r\n\r\n[110] Navagero, 49.\r\n\r\n[111] Postel, iii. 23.\r\n\r\n[112] Navagero, 49.\r\n\r\n[113] Postel, iii. 23.\r\n\r\n[114] Geuffroy, 240. Bragadin (1526), 103, says: “Ibrahim has his mother\r\nand two brothers in the palace. He does much good to Christians. His\r\nfather is _Sanjak_ in Parga.” And again, 104: “Ayas has three brothers.\r\nHis mother at Avlona is a Christian, and he sends her 100 ducats\r\nannually.” Nicolay, 86, says, on the contrary, that the tribute boys are\r\nnever afterwards willing to recognize father, mother, or relatives. He\r\ncites the case of an uncle and nephews of Rustem Pasha, who begged in\r\nAdrianople, but received no aid from him. Cf.

In the seventeenth century the sultan allowed\r\nthe children of pashas only what pleased him (Ricaut, 131). Morosini,\r\n274, refers to a similar practice in the latter part of the sixteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n[126] Ricaut, 16, calls the Turkish court “a prison of slaves.”\r\n\r\n[127] Hammer, _Geschichte_, ii. 379.\r\n\r\n[128] Busbecq, _Life and Letters_, i. 159.\r\n\r\n[129] D’Ohsson, vii. 61 ff.\r\n\r\n[130] Spandugino, 77; Ramberti, below, p. 253; Junis Bey below, p. 268;\r\nNicolay, 64.\r\n\r\n[131] Spandugino, 78, is probably wrong in his statement that the girls\r\nof the harem were recruited from gifts, _tithes_, and _tribute_. The\r\nsmall number of women in the harem would make the elaborate process of\r\ntribute-taking unnecessary.\r\n\r\n[132] Postel, i. 34.\r\n\r\n[133] Navagero, 75; Jovius, _Historiarum_, ii. 371. But Bragadin, 101,\r\ncalls her a Montenegrin, and Ludovisi, 29, an Albanian; while Busbecq\r\n(_Life and Letters_, i. 178) says that she came from the Crimea. Gomara\r\nindicates that her Turkish name was Gul-behar, the Rose of Spring\r\n(Merriman, _Gomara’s Annals of Charles V_, 141). This confusion of\r\nknowledge in regard to so important a personage gives evidence of the\r\nsecrecy which surrounded the sultan’s harem.\r\n\r\n[134] See below, p. 79, note 2.\r\n\r\n[135] Hammer, _Geschichte_, i. 232. Spandugino, 69, says that many were\r\nmade such. Menavino, who was himself a page, says that very few were so\r\ntreated, and only for punishment (_Trattato_, 138).\r\n\r\n[136] Spandugino, 69; Busbecq, _Life and Letters_, i. 237.\r\n\r\n[137] Menavino, 143; “Schaiui chiamati Bascia [pasha].”\r\n\r\n[138] Busbecq, _Life and Letters_, i. 112. Selim I, married a princess,\r\ndaughter of the Khan of the Crimean Tartars. This appears to have been\r\nthe last of such alliances, of which there were a number in earlier times.\r\n\r\n[139] D’Ohsson, vi. 9.\r\n\r\n[140] _Ibid._ vii. 177. In 1537, Junis Bey (below, p. 265) says that\r\nAyas had 600 slaves, Mustapha 200, Kassim 150, Barbarossa 100. But this\r\naccount must contain misprints or errors; for Ramberti (below, p. 246)\r\nsays that in 1534, Ibrahim had more than 6000 slaves, Ayas 2000, Kassim\r\n1500, and Barbarossa about 4000. Bragadin, 103, said in 1526, that\r\nIbrahim had 1500 slaves, Mustapha 700, Ayas 600. Junis Bey (256-258) says\r\nfurther that the _Beylerbeys_ of Rumelia and Anatolia and Caramania had\r\n1000 slaves each, the _Beylerbey_ of Syria 2000, the _Beylerbey_ of Cairo\r\n4000, etc. Iskender Chelebi had 6000 slaves (Hammer, _Geschichte_, iii.\r\n144). Geuffroy, 240, says of the viziers: “Tous ont saray de femmes et\r\nd’enfans comme ledict grant Turc.” See also Menavino, 143; and Ramberti’s\r\ndescription of Alvise Gritti’s household at the close of his third book.\r\n\r\n[141] Hammer, _Geschichte_, iii. 157. Seven of his slaves became viziers\r\nand grand viziers, among them Mohammed Sokolli.\r\n\r\n[142] Iskender Chelebi was followed to war by 1200 horsemen (Hammer,\r\n_Geschichte_, iii. 144). Rustem trained 200 carbineers as part of his\r\nhousehold (Busbecq, _Life and Letters_, i. 242).\r\n\r\n[143] Garzoni, 413, says that 1000 _Spahis_ were assigned to the retinue\r\nof the grand vizier, and 500 to those of each of the other pashas.\r\n\r\n[144] _Tractatus_, ch. vii.\r\n\r\n[145] D’Ohsson, i. 49.\r\n\r\n[146] In the early days non-Arab converts held a position of clientage,\r\nbut they had never been slaves. In the Ottoman Empire new converts were\r\nparticularly honored, so that this distinction was lost. A partial\r\nenfranchisement was possible, and might sometimes resemble the condition\r\nof a Roman freedman. Cf. D’Ohsson, vi. 28 ff.\r\n\r\n[147] According to D’Ohsson, v. 86, no free-born Moslem could ever\r\nlawfully become a slave.\r\n\r\n[148] D’Ohsson, vi. 24.\r\n\r\n[149] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[150] _Ibid._ iv. 300 ff.\r\n\r\n[151] Spandugino, 180. It may be observed that Ottoman slavery bore no\r\nslight resemblance to the method of bondage which brought from Europe\r\nmany ancestors of present-day Americans. “In the year 1730,” says Mrs.\r\nSusannah Willard Johnson (in her _Narrative of Captivity_ reprinted\r\nSpringfield, 1907, pp. 5-6) “my great-uncle, Colonel Josiah Willard,\r\nwhile at Boston, was invited to take a walk on the long-wharf, to view\r\nsome transports who had just landed from Ireland; a number of gentlemen\r\npresent were viewing the exercise of some lads who were placed on shore\r\nto exhibit their activity to those who wished to purchase. My uncle spied\r\na boy of some vivacity, of about ten years of age, and who was the only\r\none in the crew who spoke English: he bargained for him. I have never\r\nbeen able to learn the price; but as he was afterwards my husband, I\r\nam willing to suppose it a considerable sum.... He lived with Colonel\r\nWillard until he was twenty years of age, and then bought the other year\r\nof his time.” In this account a number of the characteristics of the\r\nOttoman system can be observed. Young boys of Caucasian blood are taken\r\nfrom their native land; they are bought and sold; they are judged like\r\nyoung animals by appearance and physical activity; no taint attaches\r\nto their bondage; they may marry into the master’s family. The one\r\nnoteworthy difference is that the bondage terminates at a definite age.\r\n\r\n[152] _Tractatus_, “Orario Testimonialis”: “Denique domino meo ita carus\r\neram, ut saepius in collocutione plurium, plusquam filium suum, quem\r\nunicum habebat, me diligere assereret,” etc.\r\n\r\n[153] Postel, iii. 20, says that all the pages were considered children\r\nof the sultan, and were truly his adopted sons.\r\n\r\n[154] Ricaut, 14.\r\n\r\n[155] Postel, iii. 21.\r\n\r\n[156] Ricaut, 16.\r\n\r\n[157] Postel, iii. 21.\r\n\r\n[158] _Ibid._ 71-72; Ramberti, below, p. 255.\r\n\r\n[159] Hammer, _Staatsverfassung_, 12.\r\n\r\n[160] According to Sale’s translation, the Koran says (Sura 2: 257),\r\n“Let there be no violence in religion.” Palmer translates, “There is no\r\ncompulsion in religion.” See D’Ohsson, vi. 59; Schiltberger, 73.\r\n\r\n[161] Idris, fol. 107, quoted in Hammer’s _Geschichte_, i. 91.\r\n\r\n[162] Quoted _ibid._ ii. 117.\r\n\r\n[163] Ricaut, 147-148: “No people in the World have ever been more open\r\nto receive all sorts of Nations to them, than they, nor have used more\r\narts to encrease the number of those that are called _Turks_.”\r\n\r\n[164] _Tractatus_, ch. viii.\r\n\r\n[165] Ricaut, 46.\r\n\r\n[166] Bernardo, 369-370, and see also 359.\r\n\r\n[167] Postel, iii. 21.\r\n\r\n[168] _Ibid._ 20.\r\n\r\n[169] Ricaut, 128 ff.\r\n\r\n[170] The general Ottoman attitude on this point is shown by\r\nSchiltberger, 73: Mohammed “has also ordered, that when they overcome\r\nChristians, they should not kill them; but they should pervert them, and\r\nshould thus spread and strengthen their own faith.” _Tractatus_, ch.\r\nxi, says, “Turci neminem cogunt Fidem suam negare, nec multum instant\r\nde hoc alicui persuadendo, nec magnam aestimationem faciunt de his qui\r\nnegant.” The last clause of this testimony, however, is contrary to\r\npractically all other sources. Conversion seems sometimes to have been\r\nforced as an alternative to death when a Christian had offended greatly\r\nagainst the Mohammedan faith (Lonicerus, i. 123; see also D’Ohsson,\r\nvii. 327). Some writers, however, assert that circumcision, the outward\r\nmark of acceptance of Islam, was regularly enforced upon the tribute\r\nboys (Chesneau, 41; J. Soranzo, 245; Morosini, as quoted above, p. 41).\r\nHeidborn, 128, says that conversion was not anciently enforced on a large\r\nscale, _except_ for the recruiting of Janissaries.\r\n\r\n[171] Ricaut, 46 ff.\r\n\r\n[172] Schiltberger, 74; La Broquière, 219; Spandugino, 249. Ricaut,\r\n152, says that great inducement was offered the common people to become\r\nTurks; they obtained honor and the privilege to domineer and injure with\r\nimpunity, and they became in the fashion.\r\n\r\n[173] _Tractatus_, ch. xi, quoted above.\r\n\r\n[174] D’Ohsson, vi. 59; Ricaut, 148.\r\n\r\n[175] _Tractatus_, ch. v; Nicolay, 86.\r\n\r\n[176] Ricaut, 284.\r\n\r\n[177] Bernardo, 367; Zane, as quoted above, p. 42.

The vice which takes its name\r\nfrom Sodom was very prevalent among the Ottomans, especially among those\r\nin high position (Spandugino, 186; Busbecq, _Life and Letters_, i. 232;\r\nRicaut, 151, 211; D’Ohsson, iv. 473). The pages were apt to be afflicted\r\nby it, and were carefully watched to prevent it, and terribly punished\r\nif discovered (Ricaut, 60). Occasionally a sultan became enamored of a\r\npage (Ricaut, 61); but Suleiman seems to have been free from this vice\r\n(Busbecq, i. 159; Marini Sanuto, _Diarii_, December 6, 1523).\r\n\r\n[213] Menavino, 126-128.

The same custom was observed in the education of the\r\nprinces and of all children of great officials (Spandugino, 179).

At that time the word was applied to the foot-soldiers\r\nas distinguished from the cavalry, who were then volunteer knights. This\r\nusage survived in the Ottoman system to the extent that the regular\r\ninfantry, including the Janissaries, artillerymen, and other lesser\r\npermanent corps, were regarded as in a particular and special sense the\r\nsultan’s _kullar_ (D’Ohsson, vii. 328; Djevad Bey, i. 15-18).\r\n\r\n[286] The _Bostanjis_, or gardeners, and other _Ajem-oghlans_ of the\r\npalace service were not left behind: D’Ohsson, vii. 326; Djevad Bey, i. 7.\r\n\r\n[287] Extended accounts of the Janissaries may be found in D’Ohsson, vii.\r\n310 ff.; Hammer, _Staatsverwaltung_, 192 ff.; Zinkeisen, iii. 201 ff.;\r\nDjevad Bey, vol. i, book i.\r\n\r\n[288] For an example of the persistence of this idea, see Bérard (1909),\r\n12-13: “La Turquie désormais subsiste par le janissaire et doit vivre\r\npour le janissaire d’abord ... depuis la prise de Rhodes (1522) jusqu’à\r\nl’apparition de la flotte russe aux Dardanelles (1770), tant vaut le\r\njanissaire et tant vaut l’empire.” Professor A. C. Coolidge suggests that\r\nthe hold which this remarkable organization had upon the imagination of\r\nfellow-countrymen as well as of foreigners was in part “due to the fact\r\nthat in almost all Oriental history good infantrymen have been extremely\r\nrare, and the Janissaries were the only good infantrymen in the Ottoman\r\nEmpire.” It is also true that the Janissaries were that group within the\r\nMoslem fold which came least under the taming and subordinating influence\r\nof the system; they were a frontier province of Islamic society. When\r\nin the seventeenth century they ceased to be drawn directly from the\r\nChristian population and became a variety of military aristocracy, not\r\nonly did they remain in part a fighting infantry, but their original\r\nfreedom of spirit and action was by no means abandoned.\r\n\r\n[289] D’Ohsson, vii. 359-360; Hammer, _Geschichte_, ii. 251, 361, iii.\r\n45; Nicolay, 89.\r\n\r\n[290] Rhodes was pillaged after capitulation (1521), and so were Ofen\r\n(1529), and Wychegrad (1544): Hammer, _Geschichte_, iii. 28, 83, 263.\r\n\r\n[291] _Ibid._ ii. 252. Hence the death of a sultan was kept concealed\r\nuntil his successor had assumed power (_ibid._ 535; iii. 449).\r\n\r\n[292] Mohammed II gave them ten purses of gold (1451), _ibid._ i. 504;\r\nBayezid II gave them 2000 aspers each (1481), _ibid._ ii. 252; Selim I\r\ngave them 3000 aspers each (1512), _ibid._ 382; from Suleiman they asked\r\n5000 aspers each, which he compounded by giving them one-third in cash\r\nand increased pay (1520), _ibid._ iii. 6.\r\n\r\n[293] Before Vienna (1529), _ibid._ 88; on march toward Persia (1534),\r\n_ibid._ 148; at Tabriz (1535), _ibid._ 158.\r\n\r\n[294] This usage dates from Suleiman; D’Ohsson, vii. 354.\r\n\r\n[295] Busbecq, _Life and Letters_, i. 86: the Janissaries “are scattered\r\nthrough every part of the empire, either to garrison the forts against\r\nthe enemy, or to protect the Christians and Jews from the violence of the\r\nmob. There is no district with any considerable amount of population, no\r\nborough or city, which has not a detachment of Janissaries to protect\r\nthe Christians, Jews, and other helpless people from outrage and wrong.”\r\nJanissaries might be detailed to attend on foreign ambassadors, or to\r\nescort foreign travelers within the empire (Knolles, ed. 1687, p. 985).\r\n\r\n[296] Nicolay, 89, was perhaps the first to point out the likeness of\r\nthe Janissaries to the Roman Pretorian Guard, and to see in them a great\r\ndanger to the Ottoman Empire.\r\n\r\n[297] Hammer, _Geschichte_, ii. 420, 520.\r\n\r\n[298] _Ibid._ iii. 88.\r\n\r\n[299] Trevisano, 129, says that they had sufficient authority on the\r\ndeath of a sultan to give the empire to which of his sons they pleased.\r\nCf. J. Soranzo, 248; Morosini, 255; Garzoni, 432; Knolles (ed. 1687), 985\r\n(“neither can any of the Turks Sultans account themselves fully invested\r\nin the Imperial Dignity, or assured of their Estate, until they be by\r\nthem approved and proclaimed”).\r\n\r\n[300] D’Ohsson, i. 278-284; Heidborn, 120.\r\n\r\n[301] D’Ohsson, i. 284.

Navagero, 56, says some think\r\nthat 15,500 or 16,000 were inscribed; and Garzoni, 416, says that there\r\nwere 13,000 or 14,000. Djevad Bey, i. 90, gives 12,000 in 1523, and\r\n13,599 in 1574. In 1564 D. Barbarigo, 33, gives a precise number, 13,502.\r\nD’Ohsson, vii. 330, says, without stating any authority and against the\r\nabove contemporary evidence, that Suleiman raised the number to 40,000.\r\nHammer (_Geschichte_, i. 95, and iii. 473) says, referring to D’Ohsson,\r\nthat Suleiman had 20,000; but in his _Staatsverwaltung_, 195, he states\r\nthat Suleiman had only 12,000 before Szigets. Knolles (ed. 1687, p. 990)\r\nsays, about 1603, that the Janissaries numbered not over 12,000 to 14,000.\r\n\r\n[309] Junis Bey, 272, and Ludovisi, 17, give the number of this garrison\r\nas 3000. Postel, 38, gives the number as 30,000; this must include the\r\nMamelukes.\r\n\r\n[310] Giovio, _Commentarius_, 77: about 6000 of the older of them stay\r\nabout the Prince.

In Chalcocondyles’s time (1465), 97, the\r\nstrength of each _oda_ seems to have been of 50 men. In Suleiman’s time\r\nit was less than 100.

This was the\r\ncase only from 1515 to 1582.\r\n\r\n[315] _Kiaya_ is a word which offered infinite difficulties of\r\npronunciation and spelling; for example, gachaia, cacaia, checaya,\r\nquaia, queaya, caia, cahaia, chiccaia, chechessi. Some authors employ a\r\ndifferent spelling each time they use the word. Trevisano, 118, gives\r\nchietcudasci. _Kiaya_ represents the popular pronunciation. The more\r\nnearly correct form of the word, following the Turkish spelling, is\r\n_ketkhuda_.\r\n\r\n[316] D’Ohsson, vii. 353.\r\n\r\n[317] Djevad Bey, i. 35.\r\n\r\n[318] Ramberti, below, p. 250; Junis Bey, below, p. 266.\r\n\r\n[319] Ludovisi (1534), 9, gives a pessimistic account of them; according\r\nto him, they had not the order or the discipline or the astuteness which\r\nwas found in the Christian infantry. Postel, iii. 30, praises them\r\ngreatly for order, frugality, and temperance. Djevad Bey, i. 56-64,\r\ngives a favorable description; he says (p. 56) that the first of their\r\nfundamental laws enjoined absolute obedience.\r\n\r\n[320] Postel, iii. 31; D’Ohsson, vii. 353; Djevad Bey, i. 66, 69.\r\n\r\n[321] Busbecq, _Life and Letters_, i. 296.\r\n\r\n[322] D’Ohsson, vii. 351; Djevad Bey, i. 56-59.\r\n\r\n[323] Ramberti, below, p. 249; Junis Bey, below, p. 267; D’Ohsson, vii.\r\n352.\r\n\r\n[324] Djevad Bey, i. 289.\r\n\r\n[325] This name for the sultan’s paid cavalry is that regularly employed\r\nby the Venetian writers of the sixteenth century: for example, Moro, 337;\r\nBernardo, 330.\r\n\r\n[326] Hammer, _Geschichte_, i. 95.\r\n\r\n[327] D’Ohsson, vii. 353.\r\n\r\n[328] For the great disturbance which they raised in 1593, see Zinkeisen,\r\niii. 79.\r\n\r\n[329] All of these names are spelled with an ingenious variety in\r\ncontemporary writings:—\r\n\r\n_Spahi_: spai, spachi, sipahi, sipah, spacoillain (spahi-oghlan).\r\n\r\n_Silihdar_: selicter, sillictar, sulastrus, suluphtar.\r\n\r\n_Ulufagi_: holofagi, allophase.\r\n\r\n_Ghureba_: caripy, caripicus, ciarcagi, caripp (oglan), gharib (oglan),\r\ncapi (oglan)\r\n\r\nThe word _Spahi_ is of identical derivation with _Sepoy_.\r\n\r\n[330] Ramberti, below, p. 250; Junis Bey, below, p. 267; Postel, iii. 34.\r\nGiovio (_Commentarius_, 75) says that some _Spahis_ brought as many as\r\nten horsemen.\r\n\r\n[331] Giovio, 75; Postel, iii. 35.\r\n\r\n[332] They were called “poor youth” by Menavino, 152; Junis Bey, 267;\r\nRamberti, 251; Trevisano, 126; Postel, iii. 36. Spandugino, 97, says\r\nthat they were strangers from Asia, Egypt, and Africa. Giovio, 76, says\r\nthat they were all Moslems from Persia, Turcomania, Syria, Africa,\r\nArabia, Scythia, and even India; but he is wrong in confining them to\r\nMoslems in the sixteenth century. Trevisano, 126, asserts that they were\r\nrenegades from every nation; and on this authority Zinkeisen falls into\r\nthe opposite error of confining them to Christian renegades. Postel, iii.\r\n36, says that they were chosen from the _Akinji_, Kurds, and _Azabs_.\r\nMenavino, 152, declares that they were not slaves of the great Turk, but\r\nthat part were Turks, part Christian renegades, and part Arabs (_Mori_).\r\n\r\n[333] The _Spahis_ of the Porte are discussed at length in D’Ohsson, vii.\r\n364 ff.; Hammer, _Staatsverwaltung_, 237 ff.; Zinkeisen, iii. 168 ff.\r\n\r\n[334] Giovio (_Commentarius_, 75) mentions 2000 in each of the first two\r\ncorps, and 1000 in each of the second two. Junis Bey (below, p. 267)\r\nputs 3000 in each of the first two corps, 2000 in each of the second\r\ntwo. Ramberti (below, p. 250) gives more than 3000 _Spahi-oghlans_, 3000\r\n_Silihdars_, and 2000 in each of the other corps. Ludovisi, 15, puts 3000\r\nin each of the first two, 2500 in the third, and 2000 in the fourth.\r\nTrevisano, 125, puts 2000 in each but the fourth, which contained 1500.\r\nD. Barbarigo, 33, mentions 7095 _Spahis_. Barbaro, 304, says that there\r\nwere 15,000 _Spahis_ of the Porte. There were under pay in 1660, after\r\nserious changes, 7203 _Spahis_, 6254 _Silihdars_, 976 _Ulufajis_, and 722\r\n_Ghurebas_: Hammer, _Staatsverwaltung_, 175.\r\n\r\n[335] A calculation based on Junis Bey’s statements gives a total of\r\nbetween 41,000 and 49,000. Garzoni, 413, says distinctly that there were\r\n40,000 _Spahis_ of the Porte paid out of the sultan’s treasury; that\r\namong these were 3000 _Spahi-oghlans_, 3000 _Silihdars_, 3000 _Ulufajis_,\r\nand 2000 _Ghurebas_ (_ciarcagi_); and that the grand vizier had 1000\r\n_Spahis_ assigned to his retinue, and the other viziers each 500.\r\nD’Ohsson, vii. 364-365, states that the _Spahis_ proper in the time of\r\nMohammed II, numbered 10,000, and that Achmet III, raised their strength\r\nto 12,000; like figures for the _Silihdars_ were 8000 and 12,000. This\r\nestimate must include the additional horsemen.\r\n\r\n[336] Hammer, _Geschichte_, iii. 57; Menavano, 148, 151.\r\n\r\n[337] See above, pp. 47 (note 1), 91. The Ottoman feudal system is\r\ndiscussed at length in Hammer, _Staatsverfassung_, 337 ff.; D’Ohsson,\r\nvii. 372 ff.; Zinkeisen, iii. 145 ff.; Belin, _Du Régime des Fiefs\r\nMilitaires en Turquie_; Tischendorf, _Moslemisches Lehnswesen_.\r\n\r\n[338] Junis Bey (below, p. 271) says, shortly after describing the feudal\r\n_Spahis_ of Europe, that “all the _Spahis_ are slaves and sons of slaves\r\nof the Seigneur (_Tutti li spachi sono schiaui & figli de schiaui del\r\nSig[nor]_);” but this statement is incomplete. Ramberti (below, p. 256)\r\nadds, “and sons of _Spahis_.” The latter group undoubtedly contained the\r\ngreat majority of the feudal _Spahis_. Geuffroy 246, enlarges on the\r\nstatement by saying that the 30,000 feudal _Spahis_ of Europe were all\r\n_Ajem-oghlans_ and slaves of the great Turk. No other writer terms them\r\n_kullar_. Garzoni, 412, calls them Turkish soldiers. The whole theory\r\nof the Ottoman feudal system made them such; the smaller fiefs were\r\nhereditary from of old, and gaps were filled from volunteers with the\r\narmy, who must have been Moslems, since Christians were not allowed to\r\nbear arms: Hammer, _Staatsverfassung_, 349 ff. (“_Kanun-nameh_ of the\r\ngranting of _Timars_ and _Ziamets_”).\r\n\r\n[339] Junis Bey, p. 271 (they collect the income from the Christians,\r\netc.); Moro, 339 (they are appointed by the king to administer justice);\r\nHammer, _Geschichte_, iii. 478; D’Ohsson, vii. 373. Heidborn, 157,\r\ndiscusses their duties in some detail.\r\n\r\n[340] Hammer, _Staatsverwaltung_, 275; Heidborn, 145.\r\n\r\n[341] Hammer, _Geschichte_, iii. 476.\r\n\r\n[342] Spandugino, 146, states that under Mohammed II, each fief-holder\r\nwho had 5000 aspers of income was obliged to bring another with him to\r\nwar; but in his time (under Bayezid II) this obligation was imposed upon\r\nthose who had 3000 aspers, unless retired on account of age. Ramberti and\r\nJunis Bey (below, pp. 256-271) say that for each 100 ducats a _Spahi_\r\nmust keep an armed horseman, and three or four servants, and a like\r\nnumber of horses; see also D’Ohsson, vii. 373. Heidborn, 145, states that\r\nholders of _timars_ brought an additional warrior for each 3000 aspers of\r\nincome, and holders of _ziamets_ an additional one for each 5000 aspers;\r\nbut in any case the first 3000 aspers was exempt.\r\n\r\n[343] D’Ohsson, vii. 374.\r\n\r\n[344] Hammer, _Staatsverfassung_, 352.\r\n\r\n[345] _Ibid._ 94.\r\n\r\n[346] Hammer (_ibid._ 143 ff.) describes Suleiman’s legislation, giving\r\ntranslations of much of it.\r\n\r\n[347] Ricaut, 343.\r\n\r\n[348] D’Ohsson, vii. 374; Hammer, _Staatsverfassung_, 352 ff.\r\n\r\n[349] The limit differed according to region. In Rumelia a _teskereh_ was\r\nrequired for all _timars_ of 6000 aspers and over, and for all _ziamets_:\r\nHammer, _Staatsverwaltung_, 275.\r\n\r\n[350] Ramberti (below, p. 256) gives this limit as 100 ducats, or 5000\r\naspers.\r\n\r\n[351] Garzoni, 413; Tanco, 209.\r\n\r\n[352] Bernardo, 329; Knolles (ed. 1687), 983.\r\n\r\n[353] Spandugino, 211; Zinkeisen, iii. 129. The feudal _Spahis_ had\r\nlower officers who were not sent out from the capital, such as the\r\n_Cheribashis_.\r\n\r\n[354] The name means “ensign bey,” and was translated _flambole_: for\r\nexample, Geuffroy, 246.\r\n\r\n[355] Postel, iii. 44; Tiepolo, 138.\r\n\r\n[356] Heidborn, 140, says that the _Subashis_ had _ziamets_, the _Alai\r\nBeys_ had small _khasses_, the _Sanjak Beys_ had _khasses_ of a million\r\naspers or more, and the _Beylerbeys_ much more. The amount which he\r\nassigns to the _Sanjak Beys_ is too large for Suleiman’s time. Ramberti\r\n(below, pp. 256-258) gives their income at from 4000 to 12,000 ducats,\r\nwhich would amount to from 200,000 to 600,000 aspers.\r\n\r\n[357] Ramberti, below, p. 256; Junis Bey, below, p. 271.\r\n\r\n[358] Menavino, 186, 190, says that in his time the _Beylerbey_ of\r\nAnatolia resided at Kutaia (Custage). Ramberti, 259, mentions the same\r\nplace (Chiothachie) as the seat of his sanjakate. Knolles (ed. 1687, p.\r\n986) says that all the _Beylerbeys_ except the _Beylerbey_ of Rumelia\r\nwere supposed to reside within their dominions.\r\n\r\n[359] _Tractatus_, ch. xi.\r\n\r\n[360] Trevisano, 132.\r\n\r\n[361] In Europe 30,000 _Spahis_ and 20,000 _Timarjis_; in Anatolia 12,000\r\n_Spahis_; in Karamania 7000, Amasia 4000, and Avandole 7000. This is the\r\nestimate of Junis Bey and Ramberti, which Geuffroy, 247, follows, and\r\nwhich Postel, iii. 37 ff., changes a little (Karamania 5000 instead of\r\n7000, Amasia omitted). Ludovisi, 16, gives practically the same figures.\r\nNavagero, 41, gives 40,000 in Europe and 80,000 to 100,000 in Asia, the\r\nlatter figure probably including the troops of Syria and Mesopotamia, and\r\nof Egypt, which was not provided with fiefs in the same way. Barbaro,\r\n304, and Garzoni, 412, mention 80,000 in Europe and 50,000 in Asia. D.\r\nBarbarigo (1558), 33, speaks of a sum total of 160,000 feudal _Spahis_.\r\nTiepolo (1576), 140, speaks of 60,000 _timars_ in Europe which sent\r\n80,000 _Spahis_, and 50,000 _Spahis_ from Asia. The number may have\r\nincreased about one-half during Suleiman’s reign, but it is more likely\r\nthat all the groups of figures are only estimates. Ricaut, 341, after\r\ncareful inquiry, gives the number of _Zaims_ in his time as 10,948, and\r\nof _Timarjis_ as 72,436, for the whole empire except Egypt. He thinks\r\nthat this estimate should be increased to 100,000. The total feudal\r\ncontingent in the time of Achmet I, was by Turkish authority about the\r\nsame (Tischendorf, 57 ff.). D’Ohsson, vii. 375, estimates the feudal\r\ntroops at 200,000 in Suleiman’s time; on p. 381, however, he speaks of\r\nmore than 150,000 men. See below, p. 107, n. 1.\r\n\r\n[362] Postel, iii. 38 (“triple pour le moins”).\r\n\r\n[363] Chesneau, 46; D’Ohsson, vii. 381. Knolles (ed. 1687, p. 990) says\r\nthat not over one-third could safely be called to arms.\r\n\r\n[364] After the year 1541: Hammer, _Geschichte_, iii. 232.\r\n\r\n[365] After the year 1552: Trevisano, 124. The number of the _Beylerbeys_\r\nwas greatly increased in the last third of the sixteenth century.\r\nKnolles, 986-988, mentions five in Europe, 30 in Asia, and 4 in Africa,\r\nbesides the _Beylerbey_ of the Sea, whose office was created by Suleiman,\r\nbut who is not mentioned above as having no part in the army.\r\n\r\n[366] Spandugino, 153; Nicolay, 160.\r\n\r\n[367] The name _akinji_ is variously spelled: yachinji, alcanzi,\r\nalcangi, aconiziae, alengi, aquangi, achiar, aghiar. Spandugino, 150,\r\nsays that the sultan can collect 200,000 of these for the war; Ramberti\r\nand Junis Bey (below, pp. 257, 271) mention 60,000 as inscribed; Giovio\r\n(_Commentarius_, 81) names 30,000; Garzoni, 414, says 25,000 or 30,000;\r\nPostel, iii. 26, says 50,000 or 60,000. Ramberti, 271, tells us that when\r\nin arms they were entitled to living expenses from the villages near\r\nwhich they passed.\r\n\r\n[368] Zinkeisen, iii. 203.\r\n\r\n[369] Spandugino, 152. Junis Bey, 270, mentions 1000 with the fleet, and\r\nPostel, iii. 71, mentions 10,000.\r\n\r\n[370] Postel, iii. 26.\r\n\r\n[371] Chalcocondyles, 135; Giovio, _Commentarius_, 81, etc.\r\n\r\n[372] Spandugino, 151.\r\n\r\n[373] See above, p. 98.\r\n\r\n[374] Junis Bey, below, p. 268. In addition were several thousand\r\nsaddlers, etc., who were not reckoned as regular troops: the _Bostanjis_,\r\nolder pages, body-guards, etc.\r\n\r\n[375] Knolles (ed. 1687), 984.\r\n\r\n[376] Several contemporary estimates of the complete army may be\r\ncompared: Marini Sanuto, under date of October 26, 1529, gives an\r\nestimate of the Turkish army then before Vienna as containing 305,200\r\nmen. The same writer (_Diarii_, lvi) gives three or four estimates from\r\nthe year 1532, when Suleiman went forth on the Güns campaign: on p.\r\n768, Suleiman’s army is said to contain 500,000 men; on p. 870 is found\r\nan account of Suleiman’s entry into Belgrade, in which 170,300 men are\r\nmentioned, besides “adventurers” and “many others”; on the same page\r\nis estimated the number with which the Sultan was to leave Belgrade,\r\nwhich sums up 284,500, and does not seem to account fully for the\r\nterritorial armies; on p. 894 he summarizes a despatch from Ratisbon,\r\ndated August 23, 1532, which relates the testimony of three Turkish\r\nprisoners to the effect that the Turkish army numbers over 300,000\r\npersons, but that not over 80,000 are good fighting men. Postel, iii.\r\n38, estimates the enrolled army at 218,000, and the whole at 500,000.\r\nHe states elsewhere that Suleiman took 500,000 men with him on the\r\nPersian expedition of 1534-35. Chesneau’s impression (pp. 106-108) of\r\nSuleiman’s army, when he saw it near Aleppo in the spring of 1549, was\r\nthat it occupied 80,000 to 100,000 tents, on a plain eight to ten miles\r\nlong; that it contained 300,000 to 400,000 fighting men, of whom all\r\nbut 10,000 or 12,000 Janissaries were on horseback; and that the total\r\nnumber of persons assembled was about a million. Chesneau’s chief, the\r\nambassador D’Aramont, writing concerning the same expedition from Esdron\r\n(Erzerum?) a few weeks later, speaks of “the mass of his (Suleiman’s)\r\narmy, which is by common estimate of 300,000 men, as may be judged from\r\nthe extent of the camp, which extends ten or twelve miles in length, and\r\ncontains at least 60,000 tents or more, with such order and obedience\r\nthat, considering the great multitude, it is almost unbelievable”\r\n(Charrière, ii. 68). In the year 1558, A. Barbarigo, 150-151, estimated\r\nthe cavalry alone at more than 300,000. Twenty-six years after Suleiman’s\r\ndeath Bernardo, 331, says that the paid troops, in which he includes\r\nthe sultan’s household and the feudal army, amounted to 250,000 men.\r\nZinkeisen, iii. 199, estimates the extreme total of the sultan’s cavalry\r\nalone at 565,000. Knolles (ed. 1687, p. 984), writing about 1603, says\r\nthat the sultan could always gather 150,000 Timariotes for a great\r\nexpedition. He says that the Timariotes numbered in all 719,000 fighting\r\nmen, of whom 257,000 were in Europe and 426,000 in Asia. The last two\r\nestimates are incredibly large.\r\n\r\n[377] _Tractatus_, ch. xi, marginal summary.\r\n\r\n[378] La Broquière, 273.\r\n\r\n[379] Chalcocondyles, 135.\r\n\r\n[380] Giovio, _Commentarius_, 83 (condensed).\r\n\r\n[381] Busbecq, _Life and Letters_, i. 293; on p. 221 he compares Turkish\r\nand Western soldiers most unfavorably for the latter.\r\n\r\n[382] Postel, i. 126; see also Dandolo, 166.

Erizzo, 131, also discusses this danger, emphasizing the valor\r\nof the Persians and the readiness of Asia Minor to revolt. The Turks\r\nin Constantinople in 1535 feared that the expedition which Charles V\r\nwas preparing against Tunis was intended for an attack upon their city\r\n(_Revue Africaine_, xix. 352).\r\n\r\n[399] Suleiman in his letter to Ferdinand, November 27, 1562, says, “I,\r\nLord of the Orient from the land of Tsin to the extremity of Africa”:\r\nBusbecq, _De Re Militari_, 272.\r\n\r\n[400] Ibrahim said, “I, if I now wished it, could place Luther on one\r\nside and the Pope on the other, and compel them to hold a council; what\r\nCharles ought to have done, the Sultan and I will now do”: Hammer,\r\n_Geschichte_, iii. 134.\r\n\r\n[401] Gerlach, 257, quoted in Zinkeisen, iii. 222.\r\n\r\n[402] Postel, iii. 19.\r\n\r\n[403] Spandugino, 218; Postel, i. 126.\r\n\r\n[404] D’Ohsson, vii. 202.\r\n\r\n[405] Suleiman permitted this because of the increase it produced in his\r\nincome: Busbecq, _Life and Letters_, i. 114; Halil Ganem, i. 197.\r\n\r\n[406] D’Ohsson, vii. 182, 202.\r\n\r\n[407] Ricaut, 140; D’Ohsson, vii. 287.\r\n\r\n[408] Montesquieu, livre v, ch. xix.\r\n\r\n[409] Postel, i. 126: “les gents de la court, qui ont leurs chefs _Aga_ &\r\n_Bassi_ pour Iuges,” etc.\r\n\r\n[410] Spandugino, 214 ff., relates how this came about, and says (p.\r\n218), “No _Cadi_ can have power and authority over the slaves who receive\r\npay from the Seigneur.”\r\n\r\n[411] Zane, 407; Robertson, i. 249.\r\n\r\n[412] Hammer, _Geschichte_, i. 176, 684; ii. 674.\r\n\r\n[413] _Ibid._ i. 96.

Ricaut, 107, says that in his time there existed an\r\n“ancient compact” by which, in default of heirs male in the Ottoman line,\r\nthe empire was to descend to the Crimean Tartars.\r\n\r\n[417] Ricaut, 211.\r\n\r\n[418] _Ibid._ 129: “A Turk is never reverenced but for his Office, that\r\nis made the sole measure and rule of his greatness and honour, without\r\nother considerations of Vertue or Nobility.”\r\n\r\n[419] Below, ch. vii.\r\n\r\n[420] Above, ch. iii, under heads “Other Motives for Incorporating\r\nChristians,” “Advancement Based on Merit.”\r\n\r\n[421] Ricaut, 129.\r\n\r\n[422] About the year 1800, when the two institutions, and particularly\r\nthe Ruling Institution, had reached an extreme state of decay, and\r\nbefore new institutions after Western models had yet been introduced,\r\nthe Ottoman Empire was to come very near to such a breaking-up. It seems\r\nactually to have been saved by the lingering of the tradition against\r\nheredity in office; for, though life-tenure of purchased governorships\r\nhad become regular, no Pasha except the North African corsairs of the\r\nseventeenth century, and Ibrahim in Egypt in the early nineteenth\r\ncentury, succeeded in founding a dynasty upon Ottoman soil. For the\r\ndisorders about 1800, see Heidborn, 144.\r\n\r\n[423] Hammer, _Geschichte_, iii. 490-491, quoting Kochi Bey.\r\n\r\n[424] See above, p. 69, note 3.\r\n\r\n[425] Hammer, _Geschichte_, iii. 278.\r\n\r\n[426] Hammer, _Staatsverwaltung_, 6.\r\n\r\n[427] Postel, i. 31, says that Suleiman occasionally sent for one of his\r\nwomen to visit him in the principal palace. Nicolay, 62, reports that\r\nabout 1551 Roxelana was residing within the palace grounds. By 1585 the\r\nprincipal ladies of the harem had been transferred to the new palace,\r\nleaving the old palace to the function of a training-school for recruits.\r\nThese steps illustrate the rapid increase of the importance of the harem\r\nin the Ottoman scheme.\r\n\r\n[428] Exceptions were made in case of the old _Hojas_, or teachers of\r\nthe young princes, the religious advisers of the queen mother, and\r\nphysicians. See Postel, i. 35; Ricaut, 68; D’Ohsson, vii. 11; Hammer,\r\n_Staatsverwaltung_, 73.\r\n\r\n[429] _Siasset Namèh_, 121, 123, 163.\r\n\r\n[430] “_Kanun_ of the Imperial Table,” printed in Hammer’s\r\n_Staatsverfassung_, 98: “It is not my _Kanun_ that any one should dine\r\nwith my Imperial Majesty; it might be some one not of Imperial blood.”\r\nSuleiman did not always observe this _Kanun_ (cf. Hammer, _Geschichte_,\r\niii. 99).\r\n\r\n[431] Erizzo, 138; Morosini, 281.\r\n\r\n[432] Extended descriptions of the household are found in D’Ohsson, vii\r\nand Hammer’s _Staatsverwaltung_. Lane-Poole, in his _Story of Turkey_,\r\nch. xiv, gives a good, clear summary of D’Ohsson.

Twenty years earlier Menavino, 180, speaks of about forty.\r\n\r\n[438] Ricaut, 67-68, mentions several of these.\r\n\r\n[439] Postel, i. 35.\r\n\r\n[440] Ricaut, 73.\r\n\r\n[441] Hammer (_Geschichte_, ii. 222) says that the custom of\r\naccomplishing the death of sons of daughters of sultans (by neglecting to\r\ntie the navel cord) dates from Mohammed II; but no contemporary authority\r\nappears to mention such a custom. D’Ohsson, vii. 93, says that it was\r\ninstituted in the time of Achmet I. The son of a sister of Selim I was\r\n_Beylerbey_ of Aleppo about 1550 (Alberi, _Anonimo_ of 1553, 228).\r\n\r\n[442] Ludovisi, 29; Postel, i. 31. See p. 141, note 2.\r\n\r\n[443] Postel, i. 31.\r\n\r\n[444] Spandugino, 64.\r\n\r\n[445] Menavino, 137.\r\n\r\n[446] D’Ohsson, vii. 34. Whether this number was fixed in Suleiman’s\r\ntime does not appear from the records. Mohammed II had 32 officers of\r\nthe _Khas Oda_ (Hammer, _Staatsverfassung_, 96). Menavino, 121-123,\r\nnames three special officers, 15 of second grade, and 35 of third grade,\r\nbefore mentioning the treasury. Ramberti and Junis Bey (below, pp. 243,\r\n263) name 6 principal officers, but do not distinguish the _odalar_\r\nfurther. Chesneau, 39, says that 25 of the pages were Suleiman’s personal\r\nservants, and that 5 served him specially. Navagero, 45, speaks of 25 or\r\n30 in the _Khas Oda_. Ricaut, 52, speaks of 40.\r\n\r\n[447] Ramberti and Junis Bey, as above; Postel, iii. 4; Navagero, 45.\r\n\r\n[448] Navagero, 44.\r\n\r\n[449] The number of pages in the _Kiler Odassi_ is given by Menavino,\r\n125, as 25, all between 20 and 22 years of age. Navagero, 44, says that\r\nthey numbered 300 or 400; but this is incredible. He gives no numbers for\r\nthe purely educational _odalar_, and evidently has counted them all in\r\nthe _Kiler Odassi_.\r\n\r\n[450] Hammer (_Staatsverwaltung_, 30) erroneously says that the pages\r\nof these _odalar_ attended to the lowest duties of the palace, and were\r\nrecruited from three palace schools outside. Navagero, 44, disproves this.\r\n\r\n[451] An additional chamber, the _Seferli Odassi_, or Chamber of\r\nCampaign, was instituted by Murad IV to attend to his laundry work and\r\nother special duties in time of war. The membership was chosen out of the\r\neducational _odalar_, and it ranked next after the _Kiler Odassi_. See\r\nHammer, _Staatsverwaltung_, 28.\r\n\r\n[452] Ricaut, 47.\r\n\r\n[453] Ramberti, below, p. 255.\r\n\r\n[454] Ramberti and Junis Bey, below, pp. 245, 264.\r\n\r\n[455] Menavino, 160 ff.\r\n\r\n[456] Zinkeisen, iii. 181, states erroneously on the authority of\r\nTrevisano, 125 (meaning p. 128), that these were all Turks and of noble\r\nblood. The fact that Menavino, 146, calls them “schiaui” is sufficient\r\ndisproof. Zinkeisen also quotes Spandugino, 114, to the effect that\r\nthe _Muteferrika_ were all lords, or sons of princes or of lords; but\r\nSpandugino, 62, says that pages pass to the office of _Muteferrika_ from\r\nthe highest four offices at least. Trevisano, 127, says, “Li quali sono\r\ngiovani nati Turchi, _e figliuoli d’uomini di autorità_” (italics not in\r\noriginal); but “men of authority” were practically all renegades. Moro,\r\n341, calls them, in 1590, sons of the principal Turks. The fact seems to\r\nbe that most of the _Muteferrika_ were Ottomans of the second generation\r\n(_i. e._, sons of renegades) and that the rest were regarded as ennobled\r\nby passage through the high offices of the _Khas Oda_.\r\n\r\n[457] Menavino, 155 (he says they were Persians); Nicolay, 98; Ramberti,\r\nbelow, p. 251.\r\n\r\n[458] Spandugino, 116, gives the number 300, and says that they became\r\nJanissaries. Menavino, 140, mentions 500. Ramberti (pp. 246, 253)\r\nmentions 250 at the principal palace and 100 at the palace of the harem;\r\nthe latter he calls Janissaries.\r\n\r\n[459] Junis Bey, below, p. 265.\r\n\r\n[460] Spandugino, 125.\r\n\r\n[461] Postel, iii. 9.\r\n\r\n[462] Ricaut, 373.

In D’Ohsson’s time (vii. 15) this official was also\r\nthe jailer and presiding executioner of the palace, inspector of the\r\nwater supply and forests near the capital, and overseer of hunting and\r\nfishing and of the trade in wine and lime. How many of these functions he\r\nexercised under Suleiman seems not to have been recorded. In Spandugino’s\r\ntime (p. 118) the chief _Kapuji_ was presiding executioner.\r\n\r\n[466] Ramberti, 251; Junis Bey, 268.\r\n\r\n[467] Menavino, 150. They were not _kullar_.

See Della\r\nValle, i. 45: “Tutti gli uffici, e tutti gli ordini, tanto della militia,\r\nquanto della Corte, e d’ogni altra sorte di persone, hanno qui il loro\r\nhabito proprio, and in particolare al portamento della testa, si cognosce\r\nciascuno che cosa è.”\r\n\r\n[482] Postel, iii. 13; Hammer, _Geschichte_, iii. 18.\r\n\r\n[483] Ricaut, 156.\r\n\r\n[484] The festival of the Birth of the Prophet was not instituted until\r\nthe reign of Murad III (Hammer, _Staatsverfassung_, 469). The sultan’s\r\nannual visit to the relics of the Prophet also became a great ceremony.\r\n\r\n[485] Hammer, _Geschichte_, iii. 96-101. Only less splendid was the\r\nmarriage of Ibrahim to Suleiman’s sister in 1524 (_ibid._ 38).\r\n\r\n[486] Compare Gritti, 27: the Janissaries at the reception of ambassadors\r\n“stand in such quiet and order as for war that it is a marvellous thing\r\nand not to be believed by those who have not seen it with their own eyes.”\r\n\r\n[487] Busbecq, _Life and Letters_, i. 152 ff.\r\n\r\n[488] A name for Cairo, used much from the time of the crusades onward.\r\n\r\n[489] Nicolay, 88-89, explains that the wearing of ostrich plumes,\r\nattached in a tube of jeweled gold to the front of the turban, and\r\ncurving over the head and down the back, was a highly-valued privilege\r\naccorded only to such Janissaries as had distinguished themselves in\r\naction.\r\n\r\n[490] The _Solaks_.\r\n\r\n[491] The _Sharabdar_, the _Chokadar_, and the _Silihdar_.\r\n\r\n[492] Busbecq, _Life and Letters_, i. 283 ff.\r\n\r\n[493] _Ibid._, 302 ff. These quotations may profitably be compared with\r\nthose from the _Tractatus_ in regard to the simplicity of Murad II\r\n(above, p. 134). Not a few descriptions of court and camp ceremonies in\r\nthe century following the accession of Suleiman have been handed down.\r\nFor example: Suleiman’s entry into Belgrade in 1532 (Marini Sanuto, lvi.\r\n870); Suleiman’s entry into Aleppo, 1548 (anonymous report, in Alberi,\r\n3d series, i. 224 ff.); Suleiman’s reception of Captain Pinon in 1544\r\n(Maurand, 207-225); Selim II’s reception of De Noailles in 1573 (Du\r\nFresne-Canaye, 59-72); Ahmed I’s going to mosque, 1614 (Della Valle,\r\n68-71); Ahmed I’s reception of the Venetian _Bailo_, 1615 (_ibid._ 98\r\nff.).\r\n\r\n[494] Postel, i. 31, speaks of the mother of Mustapha as having superior\r\nauthority about 1537, though residing much at Magnesia; and he does not\r\nspeak of Roxelana. But Ludovisi, 29, shows that Roxelana was in 1534 the\r\nwife of Suleiman, and that the mother of Mustapha then resided with her\r\nson at Magnesia. For the decisive quarrel between Roxelana and the mother\r\nof Mustapha, see Navagero, 75.\r\n\r\n[495] Navagero, 79.\r\n\r\n[496] Described above, pp. 93-95.\r\n\r\n[497] Navagero, 76-77.\r\n\r\n[498] The unfortunate Jehangir also was thought to have come to his\r\ndeath from shock at the death of Mustapha and fear of a similar fate for\r\nhimself. See Busbecq, _Life and Letters_, i. 178; Navagero, 77. But see\r\nAlberi, _Anonimo_ of 1553, 216, for another and more credible account.\r\n\r\n[499] Hammer, _Geschichte_, iii. 425.\r\n\r\n[500] See above, pp. 78, 120.\r\n\r\n[501] Busbecq, _Life and Letters_, i. 331; Halil Ganem, i. 199.\r\n\r\n[502] Spandugino, 185. A generation earlier still La Broquière, 186,\r\nsaid: “No one speaks to them [the pashas] unless he brings them a\r\npresent, as well as one for each of the slaves who guard their gate.”\r\n\r\n[503] Spandugino, 145, relates how in his time the peasants were eaten,\r\nas it were, all the year by tithes, compulsory presents, land-tax,\r\nand extortion. The earlier sixteenth-century writers seem not to\r\nhave observed that the sultan’s subjects were especially miserable.\r\nMorosini (1585), 272, remarks vigorously upon the tyranny and oppression\r\nwhich were causing depopulation and destroying the incentive of the\r\nfarm-dwellers to produce more than a bare sustenance. Zane (1595), 395,\r\n415, writes in a similar vein. Gerlach, 52 (quoted in Zinkeisen, iii.\r\n361), found those who lived at a distance from Constantinople in a\r\nwretched state of oppression. Knolles (ed. 1687, p. 982), writing about\r\n1603, speaks of the desolate condition of the empire, especially in\r\nthose regions through which the army was accustomed to pass. In Ricaut’s\r\ntime (pp. 124, 145, 323) agricultural decline, accompanied by misery and\r\ndepopulation, was apparent.\r\n\r\n[504] Hammer, _Geschichte_, iii. 438.\r\n\r\n[505] D’Ohsson, i. 268; Heidborn, 112, note 11.

All other causes are taken\r\nbefore the _Sheriyeh_ courts if the parties agree; otherwise before the\r\n_Nizamiyeh_ courts. Thus the courts of the Sacred Law still retain a\r\ngreat deal of importance in Turkey.\r\n\r\n[520] See, in particular, above, pp. 40, 41, 42. See also Postel, i. 116\r\nff., 124 ff.; Ricaut, 200 ff. Heidborn, 43, comments on this state of\r\naffairs, and explains the comparatively recent further legal developments\r\nin Turkey as follows:—\r\n\r\n“Durant de longs siècles le fykyh, tout pétrifié qu’il était, put suffire\r\naux besoins de la société islamique et son manque de souplesse fut\r\nd’autant moins ressenti, que l’évolution de cette société elle-mème a été\r\nà peu près nulle. Assoupie dans une léthargie profonde, elle semble se\r\nrecueillir de son immense effort de jeunesse et contempler en spectatrice\r\nindifférente ou dédaigneuse les progrès réalisés, depuis, par l’Occident.\r\nEn Turquie seulement, à mesure que se resserraient ses liens avec\r\nl’Europe, fut comprise l’impérieuse nécessité de sortir de cet isolement\r\net d’emprunter à la culture occidentale certaines méthodes susceptibles\r\nde rajeunir le corps vielli de l’empire. Par suite de cette orientation\r\nrécente, le fykyh a subi, en Turquie, d’importantes abrogations de fait\r\nsinon de droit, qui atteignent cependant plutôt le domaine du droit\r\npublic que celui du droit privé. Celui-ci subsiste, dans une large\r\nmesure, malgré ses imperfections et son absence de plan et de clarté. On\r\ns’est contenté de combler ses lacunes les plus apparentes par des lois\r\nempruntées à la législation occidentale, sans se soucier de la complète\r\ndisparate créée par la réunion d’éléments aussi hétérogènes.”\r\n\r\n[521] D’Ohsson, i. 261, v. 11.\r\n\r\n[522] Macdonald, 66; Hammer, _Staatsverfassung_, 12.\r\n\r\n[523] Heidborn, 69.\r\n\r\n[524] Hammer, _Staatsverfassung_, 14; Heidborn, 71.\r\n\r\n[525] Hammer, _Staatsverfassung_, 32; D’Ohsson, i. 291.\r\n\r\n[526] Ricaut, 202; Steen de Jehay, 13 ff.\r\n\r\n[527] Hammer, _Staatsverfassung_, 31.\r\n\r\n[528] In the course of time the development of civil courts in the\r\nOttoman Empire has relegated the former judicial system to the position\r\nof ecclesiastical courts with jurisdiction similar to that of Christian\r\nchurch courts of the Middle Ages.

This shows by\r\ncomparison with the headings in Hammer’s _Staatsverfassung_, 396-424,\r\nthat Hammer has there translated at least one-half of the manuscript,\r\nthough he appears to attribute these sections to the _Kanun-nameh_ of\r\nAchmet I (_ibid._ 384). The table of contents of the latter collection of\r\nlaws is very different (see next note).\r\n\r\n[542] The _Kanun-nameh_ of Achmet I, issued in 1619, contained\r\ncollections of (1) feudal laws; (2) laws of the army, the navy, the\r\nouter and the inner service; (3) laws of police, finance, and fiefs.

Ramberti (below, p. 247) mentions but two\r\n_Defterdars_, one who took care of the revenue from all the Asiatic\r\nprovinces, Egypt, and the Danubian countries, and received ten thousand\r\nducats a year, and perquisites, the other who took care of the revenue\r\nfrom the rest of the European dominions, received six thousand ducats and\r\nperquisites, and was governor of Constantinople in the sultan’s absence.\r\n\r\n[568] Spandugino, 98.\r\n\r\n[569] Junis Bey (below, p. 265) says that the _Defterdars_ had 200 slaves\r\neach for their courts. Then he speaks of 50 scribes, each with 15 or\r\n20 slaves, and of 25 secretaries who must have been the heads of the\r\nbureaus, and who had slaves. Next he mentions the two _Rusnamehjis_, who\r\nhad 20 or 25 companions under them. Ramberti, 247, says that the first\r\n_Defterdar_ had 1000 slaves in his household, and the second 500. Postel,\r\niii. 69, mentions only one _Rusnamehji_, but clearly states that he is\r\nover the chiefs of the twenty-five bureaus.\r\n\r\n[570] D’Ohsson, vii. 264-273; Hammer, _Staatsverwaltung_, 145-170.\r\n\r\n[571] It certainly was in 1660. Cf. Hammer, _Staatsverwaltung_, 170.\r\n\r\n[572] D’Ohsson, vii. 265, omits the intendants of buildings and forage.\r\n\r\n[573] D’Ohsson, vii. 236.\r\n\r\n[574] Charges for the right to plant and transport tobacco were later\r\nassigned to the care of this bureau. See Hammer, _Staatsverwaltung_, 156.\r\n\r\n[575] At a later date, when the expenses of the harem became greater, the\r\ncustoms duties of certain regions, the tobacco revenue from Syria and\r\nArabia, and the tax on wool and yarn were also assigned to this bureau\r\n(_ibid._ 158).\r\n\r\n[576] Junis Bey (below, p. 266) and Postel, iii. 70, call this official\r\n_Defterdar-emini_. His department, in three bureaus, became a record\r\noffice of land titles (D’Ohsson, vii. 193). It may have had this wider\r\nfunction in the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\n[577] Spandugino, 65, 119; Ramberti, below, pp. 244, 248.\r\n\r\n[578] Menavino, 182; Postel, iii. 70.\r\n\r\n[579] Ricaut, 103, Ramberti and Junis Bey (below, pp. 256, 271) say that\r\nthe _Beylerbey_ of Rumelia had 100 scribes.\r\n\r\n[580] Spandugino, 148; Postel, iii. 63.\r\n\r\n[581] This subject is treated in Hammer, _Geschichte_, iii. 478-483, and\r\n_Staatsverfassung_, 180-337; D’Ohsson, v. 15-37; and, as concerns the\r\nlegal taxes, in Belin, _La Propriété Foncière_.\r\n\r\n[582] Hammer, _Staatsverfassung_, 37 ff.\r\n\r\n[583] Hammer, _Geschichte_, ii. 523, iii. 65.\r\n\r\n[584] _Ibid._ iii. 266. According to Heidborn, 339, the registering of\r\nthe lands of the different regions of the Ottoman Empire, begun in 1548\r\nby Suleiman’s order and completed after some 55 years, remains to the\r\npresent time the basis of land titles in Turkey.\r\n\r\n[585] D’Ohsson, vii. 242.\r\n\r\n[586] Spandugino, 144. Postel, iii. 65, says that the tithes (apparently\r\nthose revenues not sold in the lump or left for individual collection)\r\nwere collected by Christian receivers (_tous Chrestiens_), who delivered\r\nthem to the _Kadis_, and these to the _Sanjak_, he to the _Beylerbey_,\r\nand the _Beylerbey_ to the _Defterdars_.\r\n\r\n[587] D’Ohsson, vii. 258.\r\n\r\n[588] Hammer, _Geschichte_, iii. 471.

Chalcocondyles, 171, overestimated it at 8,000,000\r\nducats about the year 1465. Alvise Sagudino (quoted in Schéfer’s edition\r\nof Spandugino, p. lv) reckoned it in 1496 at 3,300,000 ducats; Andrea\r\nGritti, father of Alvise, made it 5,000,000 in 1503 (_ibid._ lviii);\r\nSpandugino’s estimate, under Bayezid, was 3,600,000 (_ibid._ 132).\r\nMocenigo, 54, set Selim I’s income at 3,130,000, besides 800,000 from\r\nthe Persian conquests, all spent in Persia. Minio (1522), 71, estimated\r\nthe revenue as 3,000,000. Zeno (1524), 95, called it 4,500,000, and the\r\nexpenses 3,000,000. Bragadin (1526), 106, says that the treasury had an\r\nincome of 12,000,000, of which the sultan took 4,500,000 (the larger\r\namount would no doubt include the feudal income). Minio (1527), 115,\r\nstates the income as 7,000,000. Zeno (1530), 121, gives 6,000,000 or\r\nmore for the income, 4,000,000 for the expenses. Giovio (_Commentaries_,\r\n73) sets the revenue at 6,000,000, and the expenses at 4,000,000 or\r\n5,000,000. Postel, iii. 68, gives 4,000,000 on Alvise Gritti’s authority,\r\nthough he apportions it differently from Junis Bey. D’Ohsson, vii. 258,\r\nsays that Suleiman’s revenues rose to 26,000,000 piasters. At 40 aspers\r\nto the piaster and 50 aspers to the ducat, this gives about 20,000,000\r\nducats, which is far too much.\r\n\r\n[604] Navagero (1553), 37-39, estimates 7,166,000 ducats; Trevisano\r\n(1554), 149-150, says 8,196,000 ducats. Navagero seems to overestimate\r\nthe mines (1,500,000 ducats) and the duties (1,200,000); Trevisano’s\r\nestimate of 2,000,000 from the animal tax seems unwarranted. Erizzo\r\n(1557), 130, claims to give an authentic statement of the sultan’s income\r\nand expenditure; the former he sets at 4,600,000 ducats and the latter\r\nat 3,600,000. A. Barbarigo (1558), 150, gives 7,740,000 ducats as income\r\nand 4,100,000 as expenditure. Donini, 190, says that after great efforts\r\nhe knows most certainly that the income of the treasury for 1561 was\r\n216,519,826 aspers, or 4,330,396 ducats and 26 soldi, and the expenditure\r\n206,581,957 aspers, or 4,131,639 ducats and 7 soldi. He states that this\r\nincome is less by 400,000 ducats than usual, because of the prohibition\r\nof wine. Erizzo does not include the tax on mines and salt works, and\r\nthe income from Mesopotamia and the domain lands, in his list of sources\r\nof revenue; and Donini does not specify the sources. Bernardo, 347, says\r\nthat the income in his time of service (1584-87) was 9,000,000 ducats,\r\nand that by 1592 it was 10,000,000. Knolles (ed. 1687, p. 982) estimates\r\nthe sultan’s ordinary revenues about 1603 as 8,000,000. This does not,\r\nhowever, include confiscations, fines, tribute, customs, booty, etc.,\r\nwhich Knolles (p. 983) believed to exceed the ordinary revenue. Hammer,\r\n_Staatsverwaltung_, 170, gives official figures for a hundred years\r\nlater (1660): the income of the treasury then was 600,000,000 aspers,\r\nor 11,000,000 to 12,000,000 ducats at sixteenth-century valuations;\r\ncapitation was nearly 2,000,000, land tax about as much, mines 1,000,000,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n[605] The extensive notes given above show clearly that from 1433 to 1660\r\nthere was a progressive increase in the sultan’s income, as measured\r\nin aspers or ducats. Brosch (in _Cambridge Modern History_, iii. 130)\r\naccuses Suleiman of raising by taxation double the amount exacted by\r\nMohammed II, and thus bringing undue pressure to bear. This statement\r\nfails to take account of the fact that Suleiman’s empire was about double\r\nthat of Mohammed II’s in area, population, and wealth. Also it seems to\r\nhave been the case that the value of gold and silver fell greatly after\r\nthe discovery of the American mines (Day, 135). If these effects were\r\nfelt promptly in the Levant, Suleiman’s income in the last years of\r\nhis life may have had little more purchasing power than Mohammed II’s.\r\nDistributed over a wider area, the pressure of taxation in his time may\r\neasily have been lighter than it was three generations before.\r\n\r\n[606] Postel, iii. 67, says that it does not include the _timars_. He\r\nsays (iii. 168) that some call the total revenue 12,000,000 ducats, in\r\nwhich they must include the income of the fief-holders. Bragadin, 106,\r\nsays that the income is 12,000,000. Ramberti (below, p. 261) estimates it\r\nat 15,000,000, of which 5,000,000 goes into the treasury and 10,000,000\r\nremains for the “servants of war.”\r\n\r\n[607] Hammer, _Geschichte_, iii. 472; and see above, p. 144 and note 2.\r\n\r\n[608] Accounts are given in D’Ohsson, vii. 159-172, and in Hammer,\r\n_Staatsverwaltung_, 101-137.

On reaching the door of the hall, the lesser officials stopped and\r\nseparated into two lines, between which the grand vizier advanced.

Hammer, _Staatsverwaltung_, 372-412,\r\ngives a summary of D’Ohsson’s treatment. Heidborn, 208-210, describes the\r\neducational system summarily.\r\n\r\n[649] The ten studies were grammar, syntax, logic, metaphysics,\r\nphilology, tropics, stylistics, rhetoric, geometry, and astronomy:\r\nHammer, _Geschichte_, ii. 238.\r\n\r\n[650] Among these studies were advanced rhetoric and metaphysics,\r\ndogmatics, civil law, exegesis, jurisprudence, oral tradition, and\r\nwritten documents (Hammer, _Geschichte_, ii. 239). All schools above the\r\n_mektebs_ came under the name _medresseh_. Heidborn distinguishes eight\r\nclasses to which Suleiman added four colleges of yet higher degree. His\r\nimplication (p. 210, note 5) that the student who aimed at the highest\r\njudgeships must study through eight or more _medressehs_, and then teach\r\nthrough a like series, can hardly be correct, since the ordinary human\r\nlife would be too short for such a double round. Probably the steps of\r\nprogress were not so precisely regulated or so numerous.\r\n\r\n[651] D’Ohsson, ii. 464.\r\n\r\n[652] Hammer (_Geschichte_, ix. 145-163) found 275 in Constantinople\r\nalone, of which 50 had been founded before the death of Suleiman.\r\n\r\n[653] Chalcocondyles, 53; Ramberti, below, p. 244; Junis Bey, below, p.\r\n265; etc.\r\n\r\n[654] D’Ohsson, ii. 477; Heidborn, 213.\r\n\r\n[655] Hammer, _Geschichte_, ii. 236: “The priesthood proper ... is\r\nperhaps in no other state of less influence, but the teaching body is\r\nin no other kingdom (except China) of greater weight and political\r\nimportance.”\r\n\r\n[656] Ricaut, 211.\r\n\r\n[657] Spandugino, 219; Menavino, 72 ff.; Nicolay, 121.

Heidborn, 215, says that the title _Sheik\r\nul-Islam_ was first bestowed by Murad II upon the _mufti_ of Adrianople,\r\nwho was removed to Constantinople by Mohammed II after the capture; that\r\nMohammed assigned the title _Reis ul-ulema_, or chief of the _Ulema_, to\r\nthis officer, but that he reached great dignity only under Suleiman.\r\n\r\n[663] Spandugino, 113.\r\n\r\n[664] Postel, i. 118.\r\n\r\n[665] Spandugino, 112.\r\n\r\n[666] La Broquière, 181; Ramberti, below, p. 247; Geuffroy, 241;\r\nTrevisano, 122; Busbecq, _Life and Letters_, i. 116; Bernardo, 364.\r\n\r\n[667] Heidborn, 216.\r\n\r\n[668] Ricaut, 200-202.\r\n\r\n[669] Hammer, _Geschichte_, ii. 401.\r\n\r\n[670] _Ibid._ 536 ff.; Heidborn, 215, note 16.\r\n\r\n[671] D’Ohsson, v. 104 ff.\r\n\r\n[672] See Hammer, _Geschichte_, iii. 278 ff.; and Appendix III below.\r\nHeidborn, 215, contributes further details as to the great _Mufti’s_\r\nadvance in the _cursus honorum_ of the Moslem Institution. He shows that\r\nhe began his legal studies at 27 years of age, continued them until his\r\n45th year, was made _Kazi_ of Brusa, then of Constantinople, and in his\r\n50th year (944 A.H.) _Mufti_. The last statement seems to be erroneous;\r\nfor Hammer (as above) says that he became _Mufti_ in 952 (1545 A. D.),\r\nafter eight years’ service as _Kaziasker_. Probably, then, he was made\r\n_Kaziasker_ in 944 and _Mufti_ in 952. After thirty years in that eminent\r\nposition, he died in 982 (1574).\r\n\r\n[673] Busbecq, _Life and Letters_, i. 116-117.\r\n\r\n[674] Ricaut, 202.\r\n\r\n[675] This description, based on D’Ohsson’s account, may represent\r\nat some points a development later than the time of Suleiman. No\r\nsixteenth-century writer seems to have gone into the organization of the\r\nsystem in detail. Heidborn, 220 ff., treats with fulness the past and\r\npresent judicial system of the Ottoman Empire.\r\n\r\n[676] Hammer, _Staatsverwaltung_, 380.\r\n\r\n[677] Postel, i. 117.\r\n\r\n[678] The _Subashis_ in particular were closely connected with the\r\nadministration of justice. Postel, i. 120, says loosely that _Pasha_,\r\n_Kazi_, and _Subashi_ all mean the same thing. Chesneau, 47, says that\r\nthe sultan had two judges in every city, a _Kazi_ for civil cases and\r\na _Subashi_ for criminal cases. This is certainly incorrect, for the\r\nSacred Law provided for many criminal cases, while _Kanuns_ dealt with\r\nmany civil cases. The _Sanjak Beys_ and _Beylerbeys_ held Divans, or\r\ncouncils, resembling on a lesser scale the sultan’s Divan (Heidborn,\r\n143, note 17); following the analogy of the _Kaziaskers_, the _Kazi_ of\r\nthe city in which each such officer resided would sit in his Divan and\r\ndecide the cases that came up touching the Sacred Law, and would also\r\nhold independent court at other times. In cities of lesser importance,\r\nthe _Kazis_ appear to have been the heads of the restricted municipal\r\ngovernments (_ibid._, note 16).\r\n\r\n[679] A scheme of the higher offices in the judicial system in the early\r\nnineteenth century is given in Hammer’s _Geschichte_, ix. 1-10.\r\n\r\n[680] _Kazi_ is the Turkish pronunciation of the Arabic word _kadi_,\r\njudge; _Molla_ is the Turkish form of the Arabic word _maulā_, lord.\r\n\r\n[681] Junis Bey (below, p. 265) and Postel, i. 119, state that the\r\n_Kaziaskers_ nominated all _Kazis_. Junis Bey says: “Two _Cadilescher_\r\ntalismans, one of Greece and the other of Natolia or Asia, and they each\r\nhave revenues of 6 or 7 thousand ducats a year: who are executors of\r\ntheir law ... it is they who appoint the Kadis or podestas of all the\r\nlands of the Seigneur.” Ramberti (below, p. 247) and Nicolay, 119, say\r\nthat the consent of the pashas was necessary also.\r\n\r\n[682] Ricaut, 205.\r\n\r\n[683] Hammer (as above, p. 216, note 4) gives a list of 39 judges of rank\r\nabove the _Kazis_ proper, and 243 _Kazis_ of Rumelia, 280 of Anatolia,\r\nand 34 of Egypt. The total is thus 557 _Kazis_ proper, and 596 judges in\r\nall. In the subsequent list of 247 positions in Rumelia as rearranged\r\nunder Mahmûd II, five places in the Crimea are mentioned as seats of\r\n_Kazis in partibus_, but neither list appears to mention any in North\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\n[684] Spandugino, 188; Postel, i. 127.\r\n\r\n[685] Spandugino, 213; D’Ohsson, vi. 333.\r\n\r\n[686] Postel, i. 126.

They voluntarily lodge Christian, Turk,\r\nand Jew alike.” See also Morosini, 270.\r\n\r\n[711] He built seven mosques (Hammer, _Geschichte_, iii. 456), four\r\ncolleges at Mecca (_ibid._ 459), four colleges around the Suleimanieh\r\nMosque (_ibid._ 470), and endowed them all, etc.\r\n\r\n[712] See above, p. 150.\r\n\r\n[713] Ramberti came overland from Ragusa on his journey from Venice to\r\nConstantinople.\r\n\r\n[714] The writer seems not to have observed that these groves were\r\ncemeteries.\r\n\r\n[715] The writer evidently did not know that this Egyptian obelisk\r\nconsists of a single stone. It actually rests on four bronze cubes.\r\n\r\n[716] This was the support of the tripod of the priestess at Delphi.\r\nThe heads have been broken off, and are now in the treasury of the Old\r\nSeraglio at Constantinople.\r\n\r\n[717] This was overthrown at the downfall of Ibrahim in 1536.\r\n\r\n[718] This remarkable statement is probably the source of Nicolay’s\r\nsimilar idea (p. 77). The Danube is more than two hundred miles distant\r\nfrom Constantinople.\r\n\r\n[719] Rather, of the Sea of Marmora.\r\n\r\n[720] _Marrani_: Jews and Moors of Spain, baptized, but remaining true to\r\ntheir own religion.\r\n\r\n[721] This statement and the following one are certainly exaggerations.\r\n\r\n[722] Either the writer’s geographical knowledge or the text is in\r\nconfusion. The description here, as well as that which follows, cannot be\r\nmade to fit the map.\r\n\r\n[723] The boundary between Europe and Asia is now, of course, placed far\r\nto the east of the Don.\r\n\r\n[724] Compare Junis Bey, below, pp. 272, 273.\r\n\r\n[725] Michaloghli.\r\n\r\n[726] More accurately, Othman, beginning in 1299, ruled 27 years; Orchan,\r\n33 years; Murad I, 30 years; Bayezid I, 13 years; Mohammed I (_Chelebi_)\r\nin undisputed rule 8 years, after 11 years of civil war; Murad II, 30\r\nyears; Mohammed II, 30 years; Bayezid II, 31 years; Selim, 8 years, until\r\nhis death in 1520, when Suleiman came to the throne.\r\n\r\n[727] Celeby and Calepino are forms of _Chelebi_, the Gentleman, which\r\nwas an appellation of Mohammed I; these three names, therefore, refer to\r\nthe same person.\r\n\r\n[728] At this point the writer begins to follow the pamphlet of Junis Bey.\r\n\r\n[729] Seraglio Point is thrust out into the Bosphorus just before it\r\nmeets the Sea of Marmora.\r\n\r\n[730] The land on which Mohammed’s palace was built had belonged to the\r\nchurch of St. Sophia under the Byzantine Empire. See above, p. 202.\r\n\r\n[731] Junis Bey speaks of eight youths, but names six, as below.\r\n\r\n[732] After Junis Bey. The word here is “_Chiuchter_.”\r\n\r\n[733] There were two treasurers of the household, bearing the same name.\r\nOne labored within the palace, and one without. See above, p. 127.\r\n\r\n[734] There is confusion here. The _Kapu Aghasi_ and the _Seraidar-bashi_\r\nwere the same person. The chief of the gate is rightly called the\r\n_Kapuji-bashi_. Junis Bey shows similar confusion (below, p. 263). See\r\nabove, p. 126; and Redhouse, 1435.\r\n\r\n[735] “_Talismani._” See above, p. 205.\r\n\r\n[736] “_Capoglano._” The derivation is faulty; the literal meaning is\r\n“gate-youth.”\r\n\r\n[737] “_Gianizzerotti._” Junis Bey, below, p. 263, speaks of 400\r\ngardeners, which is probably more nearly correct.\r\n\r\n[738] “_Protogero._” _Kiaya_, or by transliteration _Ketkhuda_, is the\r\nTurkish word. See above, p. 96, note 4.\r\n\r\n[739] This should read “the _Bostanji-bashi_”: Junis Bey, 263.\r\n\r\n[740] The chief taster.\r\n\r\n[741] Junis Bey, 264, says five to six aspers each.\r\n\r\n[742] Intendant or steward of the kitchen.\r\n\r\n[743] The word translated “feudal income,” or “feudal grant,” is\r\n“_timar_.” See above, p. 100 ff.\r\n\r\n[744] This sentence was evidently inserted after the previous part of the\r\nparagraph had been written. See below, p. 255.\r\n\r\n[745] “_Centola._”\r\n\r\n[746] This remark seems to contain a comparison between the relation of\r\nthe pope to the Roman emperor and that of the _Mufti_ to the sultan. Such\r\na comparison would, however, be inexact. See above, p. 209.\r\n\r\n[747] “_Cavalleria._” Junis Bey, below, p. 265, calls them _cursori_.\r\n\r\n[748] Junis Bey, 266, says 15 to 20 slaves each.\r\n\r\n[749] “_Spezzate._”\r\n\r\n[750] That the other _Chaushes_ were slaves not of the _Chaush-bashi_,\r\nbut of the sultan, is shown by the amount of their pay. See Junis Bey’s\r\ntestimony below, p. 265.\r\n\r\n[751] Junis Bey, below, p. 266, says that the _Kiaya_ of the Janissaries\r\nhas 300 ducats of feudal grant per year, which would equal about 15,000\r\naspers.\r\n\r\n[752] “_Giannizzeriasis._”\r\n\r\n[753] “_Livreri._”\r\n\r\n[754] “_Bracchi._”\r\n\r\n[755] “_Assareri._”\r\n\r\n[756] This Slavonic word seems to be used here simply in the sense of\r\n“army officers.”\r\n\r\n[757] “_Immensi._”\r\n\r\n[758] This is an error. Probably the number intended is three hundred.\r\nJunis Bey, below, p. 267, gives two hundred and fifty.\r\n\r\n[759] Only two officers should be named here. The lieutenant\r\n(_Protogero_) and the _Kiaya_ were the same. Junis Bey gives this\r\ncorrectly.\r\n\r\n[760] Under each _Agha_, or chief officer.\r\n\r\n[761] The _Kiaya_ and the lieutenant are the same.\r\n\r\n[762] This derivation is from a secondary meaning; the primary meaning is\r\n“foreign youth.” See above, pp. 98, 99, note 1.\r\n\r\n[763] “_Bracor-bashi._”\r\n\r\n[764] This should read “_Kiaya_ and secretary.”\r\n\r\n[765] “_Brene._”\r\n\r\n[766] This is the common report in Western writers as regards the\r\n_Peiks_. See Menavino, 155; Nicolay, 100.\r\n\r\n[767] _Kiayas_ and secretaries.\r\n\r\n[768] This refers to those whom Junis Bey, below, p. 268, calls\r\n_Zainogiler_, a body of lancers, who are here erroneously classed with\r\nthe falconers. Junis Bey’s figures are 20,000 in all, 1000 receiving pay\r\nin money. Are they the Voinaks (above, p. 131)?\r\n\r\n[769] Junis Bey, “_cursor_,” a messenger or porter.\r\n\r\n[770] Literally, “intendant of the town.”\r\n\r\n[771] Junis Bey says 57.\r\n\r\n[772] Usually called by Western writers “Dragoman.”\r\n\r\n[773] This was the “Old Palace” of Mohammed the Conqueror, and stood\r\nwhere the _Seraskierat_, or War Office now stands.\r\n\r\n[774] Suleiman is said to have been faithful to Roxelana after he had\r\nmade her his wife. See above, p. 56.\r\n\r\n[775] This should read “per day.” Junis Bey, below, p. 269.\r\n\r\n[776] This should read 100,000: _ibid._\r\n\r\n[777] Junis Bey, below, p. 270, says 200,000 per year.\r\n\r\n[778] At the meetings of the Divan.\r\n\r\n[779] This should read fifty each: Junis Bey, below, p. 271.\r\n\r\n[780] “_Che fanno fattione._”\r\n\r\n[781] This should read “ten thousand”: Junis Bey, below, p. 272.\r\n\r\n[782] Of the Turkish possessions in Asia.\r\n\r\n[783] “_Maldac._”\r\n\r\n[784] “_Esdum._” Junis Bey, below, p. 272, has “_exdrun_.”\r\n\r\n[785] More correctly, _Irak Ajam_, north-central Persia.\r\n\r\n[786] Junis Bey, 273, counts these as two, and the whole number as\r\nthirty-six.\r\n\r\n[787] Herzegovina.\r\n\r\n[788] “_Cangri._”\r\n\r\n[789] “_Hallayce_” or “_Allaye_.”\r\n\r\n[790] The ancient Magnesia.\r\n\r\n[791] The plain of Albistan.\r\n\r\n[792] “_Alziden._”\r\n\r\n[793] Evidently the writer intended to fill these in, but failed to\r\nsecure the names.\r\n\r\n[794] This amounts to about four million ducats a year.\r\n\r\n[795] The reference is, of course, to the feudal _Spahis_ and their\r\nofficers, who then received according to this estimate two-thirds of the\r\nrevenues of the empire.\r\n\r\n[796] At this point the smaller type begins. See below, p. 315.\r\n\r\n[797] The object of this appendix is to set forth in outline the features\r\nof the Mogul government, in order to suggest comparison with that of the\r\nOttoman Empire. Completeness neither of research nor of exposition has\r\nbeen attempted.
