A majority of all voters would\r\nwelcome Government Ownership of Railroads and other public utilities. The\r\nrecent great victory in Chicago for Municipal Ownership demonstrates this\r\nfact. What Chicago has done locally can be accomplished in the nation—and\r\nWILL be done as soon as the people overcome\r\n\r\n                            Political Inertia\r\n\r\nWith many the voting habit becomes fixed after one or two elections. The\r\nordinary man keeps on “voting ’er straight” long after he has discovered\r\nthat his party’s actions are out of joint with his own views. Party\r\n“regularity” commands the average man’s support long after he KNOWS his\r\nparty is headed wrong. Some really great men, even, have placed party\r\n“regularity” before principle.\r\n\r\n                              A Great Light\r\n\r\non the correct principle of organization is to be found in that admirable\r\nwork by George Gordon Hastings,\r\n\r\n                         The First American King\r\n\r\nA dashing romance, in which a scientist and a detective of today wake up\r\nseventy-five years later to find His Majesty, Imperial and Royal, William\r\nI, Emperor of the United States and King of the Empire State of New York,\r\nruling the land, with the real power in the hands of half a dozen huge\r\ntrusts. Automobiles have been replaced by phaërmobiles; air-ships sail\r\nabove the surface of the earth; there has been a successful war against\r\nRussia; a social revolution is brewing. The book is both an enthralling\r\nromance and a serious sociological study, which scourges unmercifully the\r\nsociety and politics of the present time, many of whose brightest stars\r\nreappear in the future under thinly disguised names. There are wit and\r\nhumor and sarcasm galore—a stirring tale of adventure and a charming love\r\nstory.\r\n\r\n                       Hon. Thomas E. Watson says:\r\n\r\n“I read ‘The First American King,’ and found it one of the most\r\ninteresting books I ever opened. Mr. Hastings has not only presented a\r\nprofound study of our social and economic conditions, but he has made the\r\nstory one of fascination. It reminds me at times of Bellamy’s ‘Looking\r\nBackward,’ but the story is told with so much more human interest, the\r\nsituations themselves are so much more dramatic, that it impresses me\r\nvery much more favorably than any book of that kind I have ever known.”\r\n\r\nInteresting as the story is as a romance and as a critical sociological\r\nstudy, one of its vitally important points is\r\n\r\n                             How to Organize\r\n\r\n    =Mr. Hastings says:=\r\n\r\n“It has been suggested,” continued General Mainwarren, “that a wise\r\ncourse for patriotic leaders of your day would have been to have\r\nabandoned the hope of converting and securing the grown voters as\r\na body. It would have been best for them, at a given time, to have\r\nsaid: ‘Beginning from today, we will pay no attention to any male who\r\nis more than fifteen years of age and who is now, or within the next\r\nsix years will be, entitled to a vote. But we will direct all efforts\r\nto an entirely new body of suffragists.’ They should then have turned\r\ntheir attention to the _women of the land_, to the mothers of future\r\ngenerations of voters. It has been said that ‘Every woman is at heart a\r\nroyalist.’ It could with equal truth be said: ‘Every woman is by nature\r\na politician.’ ... Look at the influence exerted politically by various\r\nwomen of whom history speaks.”\r\n\r\n                     This Is the Key-Note of Success\r\n\r\nFor fifteen years the People’s Party, in season and out of season, has\r\npreached “Equal Rights to All, Special Privileges to None.” It has\r\npersistently demanded that government shall attend to public matters,\r\nand that private business shall be conducted by individuals with the\r\nleast possible interference—and absolutely no favoritism—by government.\r\nIt has continually demanded public ownership and government operation\r\nof railroads and other public utilities. It has urged the initiative,\r\nreferendum and the recall; a scientific money system; the abolition\r\nof monopoly in every form. Millions of voters—as the Chicago election\r\nclearly indicates—are in accord with the People’s Party; but heretofore\r\nthe voting habit, the “vote ’er straight” political insanity, has kept\r\nthem in political slavery.\r\n\r\n                            Educate the Boys\r\n\r\nLet us train up a new generation of voters—without diminishing our\r\nefforts to break up old party habits—who will have the courage of\r\nconviction and correct ideas regarding politics and economics. Let us\r\ninterest the mothers, so we can have the boys taught to cast their first\r\nvotes on the side of Justice. Habit will then keep them voting right.\r\n\r\n                            Let Us Begin Now\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings’s book is a thought-provoker. It combines romance with\r\nsociology and teaches while entertaining. With “The First American King”\r\nand TOM WATSON’S MAGAZINE in another 100,000 homes, our first great step\r\nwill be taken toward overcoming plutocracy. With this end in view, we\r\nhave made arrangements whereby we can offer a dollar book, 350 pages, and\r\na dollar magazine one year, 128 pages monthly, both for only $1.50.\r\n\r\n      Tom Watson’s Magazine and The First American King      $1.50\r\n\r\nIn order to treat all alike, the book will be sent postpaid to any\r\npresent subscriber of TOM WATSON’S MAGAZINE on receipt of 60 cents.

WATSON\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _Our Creed_\r\n\r\nThe People’s Party does not attempt the impossible, or seek the\r\nunattainable.\r\n\r\nOur young men do not dream dreams; our old men do not see visions. We\r\nare wedded to practical reforms which have been tried in civilized\r\ncommunities, and which have vindicated themselves by results.\r\n\r\nWe do not propose to re-create society, subvert law and order, confiscate\r\nproperty, or substitute a new system of government for the old.\r\n\r\nWe do not want to tear down the house in order to repair it.\r\n\r\nWe do not hope to build a perfect state with imperfect human hands, but\r\nwe do intend to make the government as nearly perfect as possible, to the\r\nend that it shall represent that conception of justice which deals with\r\nall men alike, and allows to every child of Adam a fair chance in the\r\nworld which God created as a home for the human race.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe believe that the government should be clothed with all the attributes\r\nof sovereignty; that _the government should govern_, and should _not\r\ndelegate to private citizens or corporations_ any part of its sovereign\r\npower.\r\n\r\nThe creation of a national currency has always been an attribute of\r\nsovereignty—of royalty.\r\n\r\nIn a system where the people rule the people succeed to the power of the\r\nking; and that attribute of sovereignty which the king exercised and\r\ndid not delegate should be exercised by the people and should not be\r\ndelegated.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the Populists, successors to the old Greenbackers, have always\r\nclung to it as an article of faith that the Federal Government should\r\nexercise its constitutional right to create a currency, and should\r\nnot delegate that power to national banks or to private citizens or\r\ncorporations.\r\n\r\nThe government should supply the country with a sufficient amount of\r\nnational money, every dollar of which should be equal to any other; every\r\ndollar of which should be a full legal tender for all claims, public and\r\nprivate, and _no dollar of which should be made redeemable in any other\r\ndollar_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe believe that those things which are essentially public in their nature\r\nand their use should belong to the public, and should be equally enjoyed\r\nby all.\r\n\r\nJust as the navigable rivers are public to the beggar and the millionaire\r\nalike, just as the Bay and the Gulf and the Harbor and the navigable\r\nLakes are the common property of the rich and the poor, the high and low,\r\nthe black and white, so we believe that the roads should be common ground\r\nupon which every citizen should be free to pass upon terms of equality,\r\nand that the iron highways of today, which were taken from the people\r\nby the exercise of the right of Eminent Domain, should be restored to\r\nthe public by the same law of Eminent Domain, a fair compensation having\r\nbeen paid, and the property operated hereafter for the benefit of all the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nSo with the Telegraph and the Telephone and Express Companies.\r\n\r\nIn every city and town we believe that the municipality, which is a\r\npart of the state’s sovereignty, should take over to itself those\r\npublic utilities which in their very nature are monopolies, and, just\r\ncompensation having been paid, that these utilities should be used for\r\nthe benefit of the people, to whom they belong.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe believe that the government should be supported by a system of\r\ntaxation in which each citizen will pay taxes _in proportion to his\r\nability to pay_.\r\n\r\nWe believe in a Tax on the Franchises enjoyed by private corporations.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the Income Tax would be the fairest of all taxes, because\r\nit would take for the support of the government, not the property of\r\nthe citizen, but a portion of the income which the citizen derives from\r\nthat property, or from his individual exertions, and the tax would be\r\nproportioned to the income.\r\n\r\nThat property or that salary could not be enjoyed without the protection\r\nand the advantages which flow from government, and it is eminently\r\nfair, where the government has protected me, or where it affords me\r\nsuch opportunities, that I can receive a large income from any source\r\nwhatever, I should pay to the government, in return for its protection\r\nand its advantages, a fair share of that which I could not have made\r\nwithout that protection and those advantages.\r\n\r\nUnder our present system a man like John D. Rockefeller pays no more\r\nTariff tax when he buys a hat than a doctor or lawyer or preacher pays\r\nwhen he buys a hat. So with the shoes, the clothes, the crockery on the\r\ntable, the furniture in the house. Many a citizen whose income does not\r\namount to ten thousand dollars per year pays fully as much Tariff tax in\r\nthe purchasing of necessary articles of clothing, furniture and food as\r\nJohn D. Rockefeller pays, whose income is counted monthly by the millions\r\nof dollars.\r\n\r\nThe same thing is true of Carnegie, Morgan, Hill, Harriman, Gould,\r\nCassatt, Vanderbilt. Many a farmer whose income from his farm may not do\r\nmore than give his family an actual support, after the operating expenses\r\nare paid, contributes annually a greater sum in Tariff tax to the Federal\r\nGovernment than is paid by the fabulously wealthy beneficiaries of class\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the People’s Party dodges the Tariff issue. This is\r\nnot true.\r\n\r\nOne of our earliest platforms, which has been repeatedly reindorsed,\r\ndeclares:\r\n\r\n“_We demand the removal of the Tariff tax from the necessaries of life\r\nwhich the poor must have to live._”\r\n\r\nThis is precisely the principle announced by Thomas Jefferson, who\r\ndeclared that the taxes should be so laid that the luxuries of life would\r\nbear the burden of government, and that his ideal was a system in which\r\nthe poor would be entirely relieved from the crushing weight of taxation.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we have said that legislation should not be so framed as to\r\nbuild up one business at the expense of another.\r\n\r\nIf the People’s Party platform were enacted into law, _there could be no\r\nsuch thing as a Trust in the United States_.\r\n\r\nIn order that the people should become the victims of such tyranny as\r\nthat exercised by the Trusts two things are necessary: _Foreign relief\r\nmust be made impossible, and domestic relief made impracticable_.\r\n\r\nThe Tariff wall keeps the foreigner from interfering; the railroads and\r\nthe national banks supporting the Trusts make it impossible for domestic\r\ndissatisfaction to assert itself effectively.\r\n\r\n_If the people should put upon the free list those articles which are\r\nmade the subject of the Trusts, the foreigner could at once invade the\r\nmarket, and destroy the monopoly upon which the Trust is based._\r\n\r\nIf the Populist principles of finance and of transportation should be\r\ncarried into effect, the Government abolishing national banks and private\r\nownership of transportation lines, _the rebate would be impossible,\r\ndiscriminations would cease, equality would prevail, and there would be\r\nno collusion between the national banks and the railroads by which Trusts\r\nare made invincible as they are now invincible_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe believe in direct Legislation—putting the power of making laws and\r\nchoosing rulers back into the hands of those to whom it belongs—and the\r\nelection of all officers by the people.\r\n\r\nThe people should not be made to await the pleasure of the Legislature\r\nor of Congress. They should not be kept in ignorance of what the law is\r\nuntil legislative acts become known through the newspapers. There should\r\nbe in every case the right to initiate those laws which they want, and to\r\nveto, through the Referendum, any law which they do not like.\r\n\r\nWhen an officer whom they have elected shows by any vote or act that he\r\nis not the man they took him to be, they should not have to wait till the\r\nexpiration of his term to get a better man. They should have the right to\r\nrecall the officer the moment he betrays his trust.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe believe in the eight-hour day for labor in Government works, in\r\nfactories, workshops and mines.\r\n\r\nWe believe in the regulation of child labor in factories, workshops and\r\nmines, to the end that children of tender age shall not be made to slave\r\nout their lives in order that corporations shall have cheap labor and\r\nlarge dividends.\r\n\r\nSaturn, the old fable tells us, devoured his own children: Christian\r\ncivilization does the same thing.\r\n\r\nAs long as we permit children of ten and twelve years to labor from eight\r\nto fourteen hours per day in our mills and workshops modern civilization\r\nis another Saturn. _We are devouring our own children._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe believe that the land, the common heritage of all the people, should\r\nnot be monopolized for speculative purposes, or by alien ownership, but\r\nthat legislation should be so shaped as to encourage to its full extent\r\nthe right of every man born into this world to till the soil and make a\r\nliving out of it.\r\n\r\nAnd one of the principal reasons why we favor a graduated income tax,\r\nwhich increases by geometrical progression as the income increases, is\r\nthat it automatically keeps the wealth of the country in a constant sort\r\nof redistribution, and acts as a check upon that excessive accumulation\r\nwhich is recognized by all intelligent thinkers as one of the most\r\nserious perils and intolerable evils of our present era of class\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nThese are the most important articles of our faith. It is for these\r\nprinciples that we have struggled ever since 1891—with never a doubt that\r\nthey were sound, that they would constantly gain converts, _that they\r\nwould ultimately win_.\r\n\r\nWhen I founded the _People’s Party Paper_ in Atlanta, Ga., in 1891 (which\r\npaper lived and toiled for these principles until the fusion movement of\r\n1896 killed it, as it killed twelve hundred other Populist papers), I\r\nannounced the same purpose which I announced in the prospectus of this\r\nmagazine.\r\n\r\nMy faith was as firm in 1891 as it is today, and I had as little doubt\r\nthen as I have now that Populism is just as sure to triumph as the sun is\r\nto continue to warm the world.\r\n\r\nThe reforms will be effected _because the country needs them_. It cannot\r\nstand much more of the present system. It will not accept Socialism.\r\nOccupying the middle ground of radical, but practical reform, Populism is\r\ninevitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _National Politics and Policies_\r\n\r\nThere is a saying that the difference between a wise man and a fool is\r\nthat the wise man never makes the same mistake twice, while the fool\r\ncontinues to make it without limit.\r\n\r\nIt is of supreme importance that those who will act as political leaders\r\nduring the next four years should think clearly in order that they may\r\nact wisely.\r\n\r\nWe have not, as yet, discovered any brighter lamp with which to guide our\r\nfootsteps than that which Patrick Henry named the Lamp of Experience.\r\n\r\nIf I felt that our national leaders were about to repeat a disastrous\r\nmistake and adopt a policy which seems the continuance of the reign of\r\nclass legislation and special privilege, I should be false to my own\r\nsense of duty if I did not at this early day point out that error and\r\nwarn the Jeffersonians against it.\r\n\r\nI say Jeffersonians because, after all is said and done, there are but\r\ntwo great differences of political thought in the United States—never\r\nhave been but two; never will be but two.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand are those who believe that legislation should be dictated\r\nby the interest of the few; that the powers and the benefits of good\r\ngovernment should be monopolized by the few; that the blessings and the\r\nopportunities of life should be the heritage of the few; that wealth and\r\nprivilege and national initiative should perpetually be the legacy of the\r\nfew.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand is the Jeffersonian idea that the human family are all\r\nalike the children of God; that the earth and all it contains was created\r\nfor the benefit of this human family, and that any system of law and\r\ngovernment which gathers into the hands of the few an unjust proportion\r\nof the common estate, to the exclusion of the vast majority, is an\r\ninfamous invasion of the natural rights of man.\r\n\r\nNow, what is it that endangers the cause of the Jeffersonians?\r\n\r\nWhat is it that seems to me to be so certain to insure the continuance of\r\nthe rule of the few over the many?\r\n\r\nIt is the continued existence of the political alignment of the great\r\nmass of the people in two political parties, each of which, in its heart\r\nof hearts, is wedded to the rule of the few.\r\n\r\nNeither one of these parties wants any material change in our present\r\nsystem of legislation or of administration.\r\n\r\nBoth of them are absolutely dominated by the same interests.\r\n\r\nIn the ranks of each of these parties are found the powerful railroad\r\nkings, the irresistible trusts, the indispensable national banks, the\r\nvastly influential insurance companies.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, nearly every board of management of every predatory\r\ncorporation against which the people are rising in revolt is made up half\r\nand half of Democrats and Republicans, in order that, no matter which\r\nparty wins at the polls, the corporation will have influence at court.\r\n\r\nIt is so clear to me that the only possible hope for the people is to\r\ndrive these two parties together while the people unite under another\r\nstandard.\r\n\r\nIn vain does Judge Parker talk about the difference between his Democracy\r\nand the Republicanism of Mr. Roosevelt. During the campaign he was unable\r\nto state any difference, and there is, in fact, no difference.\r\n\r\nBetween Belmont’s ideas of government and those of Mark Hanna there is\r\nnot the slightest difference.\r\n\r\nBetween the Democratic corporation and the Republican corporation it is\r\nabsurd to claim that there is any difference.\r\n\r\nBetween Democratic manufacturers and Republican manufacturers no human\r\nbeing of intelligence will expect any difference or find any.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the millionaire beneficiaries of class legislation\r\ncontrol both of the old parties, and the battle which they wage year\r\nafter year, decade after decade, is a mere sham battle. The strategy of\r\nthe corporations consists in keeping the people divided in order that the\r\ncorporations may rule.\r\n\r\nBelieving this to be true, I am painfully impressed with the fact that\r\nMr. Bryan is making a huge mistake.\r\n\r\nThe pity of it is, he has already made that mistake twice, and is now\r\nmaking it for the third time.\r\n\r\nWhat is the mistake?\r\n\r\nIt consists of the effort to get radical reform out of a party which has\r\nalways been dominated and always will be dominated by conservatives. When\r\nthe currency was contracted just after the Civil War and ruin brought\r\nupon so many thousands of people in this country, it took the joint\r\naction of both the old parties to do it.\r\n\r\nWhen the revenue taxes were taken off railroads, manufactures, insurance\r\ncompanies, bank checks and express companies, soon after the close of the\r\nCivil War, it took the joint action of both the old parties to do it.\r\n\r\nWhen the Income Tax was lifted from the burdened shoulders of the rich,\r\nit took the joint action of both the old parties to do it.\r\n\r\nWhen Silver was struck down and the Gold Standard forced upon us, it took\r\nthe joint action of both the old parties to do it.\r\n\r\nWhen our National Bank System was enthroned, and that terribly unjust\r\nsystem was chartered to prey upon the people, it required the joint\r\naction of both the old parties to do it.\r\n\r\nWhen Congress, over the protest of Thaddeus Stevens and others, obeyed\r\nthe command of the Rothschilds (delivered at Washington personally by\r\nAugust Belmont, the father of the present Boss of the Democratic Party),\r\nand declared by legislative enactment that the banks should be paid in\r\ngold while the soldier at the front should be paid in greenbacks, it\r\nrequired the joint action of both the old parties to do it.\r\n\r\nThere has never been a necessary act of Congress—necessary to the rule\r\nof the few, necessary to carry out the Hamiltonian ideal—that did not\r\nrest for support one foot on the Republican Party and the other on the\r\nDemocratic Party.\r\n\r\nThe man who does not know this to be true is unfamiliar with official\r\nrecords.\r\n\r\nThe time has been when Mr. Bryan held the same opinions which I am\r\nexpressing now. The time has been when he declared, in speech and\r\nwriting, that there was no hope for reform in the Democratic Party.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 Mr. Bryan, in the Omaha _World-Herald_, editorially asked:\r\n\r\n“_Can a National Convention harmonize the discordant elements of the\r\nDemocratic Party? Impossible._\r\n\r\n“Suppose the advocates of bimetallism control the National Convention\r\nand nominate a Free Silver Democrat upon a free coinage platform, will\r\nCleveland, Carlisle, Olney, Morton, _et al._ support the ticket? Of\r\ncourse not. They say that the free coinage of silver means individual\r\ndishonesty, commercial disaster and national dishonor, and if they\r\nbelieve what they say they ought not to support the ticket, because\r\ntheir duty to their country is higher than their duty to their party\r\norganization. If, on the other hand, the convention nominates a Gold\r\nStandard Democrat on a platform indorsing the gold standard, gold bonds\r\nand national bank currency, should the nominee be supported by those who\r\nbelieve the gold standard to be a conspiracy of the capitalistic classes\r\nagainst the producers of wealth—a crime against mankind? Who says they\r\nshould?\r\n\r\n“If to continue Mr. Cleveland’s financial policy is to declare war\r\nagainst the common people, what friend of the common people would be\r\nwilling to enlist in such a warfare, even at the command of his party?\r\n\r\n“The Democratic Party cannot serve God and Mammon; it cannot serve\r\nplutocracy and at the same time defend the rights of the masses.\r\n\r\n“If it yields to the plutocracy it ought to lose, and it will lose, the\r\nsupport of the masses; if it espouses the cause of the people, it cannot\r\nexpect either votes or contributions from the capitalistic classes and\r\nfrom the great corporations.”\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this very correct line of reasoning, Mr. Bryan resolutely\r\ndeclared that if the Democratic Party adopted the gold standard, “_I\r\npromise you that I will go out and serve my country and my God under some\r\nother name, even if I must go alone._”\r\n\r\nAgain Mr. Bryan said, in his book called “The First Battle,” Chapter III,\r\npage 124, “In that speech I took the position which I have announced\r\nsince on several occasions, namely, that I would not support for the\r\nPresidency an advocate of the gold standard.”\r\n\r\nAgain Mr. Bryan said: “Does the individual member of a party at all times\r\nreserve the right to vote against the nominee of a party, and to abandon\r\nhis party entirely whenever in his judgment his duty to his country\r\nrequires it? He may abandon the party temporarily, as, for instance,\r\nwhen an unfit candidate is nominated, or the voter may abandon his party\r\npermanently, either when he himself changes his opinion upon a paramount\r\npublic question or when his party changes its position.”\r\n\r\nNow let the reader compare the present attitude of Mr. Bryan with the\r\npolitical ethics expounded by him in his book.\r\n\r\nHe was then the idol of the radicals; he was then the Tribune of the\r\nPeople.\r\n\r\nHe was the strong and stalwart foe of every plutocrat, every Wall Street\r\ninterest, every beneficiary of class legislation.\r\n\r\nThe people hailed him with an enthusiasm which had not been known since\r\nthe days of Henry Clay. So great was their faith in him that he swept\r\ninto his movement in 1896 the Free Silver organization and the great bulk\r\nof the Populist Party.\r\n\r\nWho is it that cannot see how loftily he held his flag in those days? Who\r\nis it that does not realize how sadly it droops today?\r\n\r\nFrom the noble stand of 1893 and 1896, what a falling off is there!\r\nBoldly he declared that he would never support for the Presidency an\r\nadvocate of the gold standard. Yet, when Judge Parker slapped his face\r\nin public with the Gold Telegram of 1904, the dauntless Bryan turned the\r\nother cheek, like a very meek Christian indeed.\r\n\r\nHe had said that a Democrat might bolt his party _temporarily_ upon the\r\nnomination of an unfit candidate; he had said that Judge Parker was an\r\nunfit candidate, but he did not bolt the nomination, even _temporarily_.\r\n\r\nHe had said that the voter might abandon his party _permanently_ when\r\nthat party changed its position upon a paramount public question; yet\r\nwhen the Democratic Party, with extraordinary suddenness, changed its\r\nposition upon more than one paramount question in 1904, Mr. Bryan did not\r\nbolt his party _permanently_.\r\n\r\nHe had said that if the Democrats took up the Republican financial\r\npolicy, which meant the slavery of the debtors of this country and the\r\nimpoverishment of the people, he would go out and serve his country and\r\nhis God under some other name, even if he had to go alone. Yet when his\r\nparty did come over to the Republican financial policy, and came by\r\ntelegraph at that, _Mr. Bryan did not go out to serve either his country\r\nor his God under some other name_.\r\n\r\nHe had said to his brother Democrats: “If you are ready to go down\r\non your knees and apologize for what you have said” (abuse of the\r\nRepublicans and the gold standard), “you will go without me.”\r\n\r\nYet when the Democratic Party, at the St. Louis Convention in 1904, went\r\ndown on its knees, in effect, to apologize for the abuse which they had\r\nheaped upon the Republicans for eight years, they did not go without Mr.\r\nBryan. The knees of Mr. Bryan hit the floor in timely cadence with the\r\nknees of all the others, and when he filed out of the convention hall the\r\ndust was there to show it just as it was there to show it on the knees of\r\nall the others.\r\n\r\nBryan himself asked the question in 1896: “Can a National Convention\r\nharmonize the discordant elements of the Democratic Party?” He answered\r\nhis own question in the comprehensive word, “_Impossible_.”\r\n\r\nThe event of the campaign of 1896 showed that he was right, for the\r\nCleveland-Carlisle-Belmont element knifed him.\r\n\r\nIn the campaign of 1900 they knifed him again. In the campaign of 1904,\r\nwhen the convention nominated a gold standard Democrat on a platform\r\nindorsing the gold standard, gold bonds and the gold bank currency,\r\nthe people refused to support the sell-out of the National Democratic\r\nParty to Wall Street, just as Mr. Bryan, in 1896, prophesied that they\r\nwould, in spite of the fact that the prophet of 1896 had become the gold\r\nstandard nominee’s most earnest advocate in the campaign of 1904.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the people had become so inoculated with the true gospel\r\nof Bryan, the Tribune of 1893 and 1896, that they refused to follow the\r\nchange of heart and the change of conduct which came over Bryan, the\r\nParkerite of 1904.\r\n\r\nWill not Mr. Bryan reflect upon this and draw a lesson from it? He\r\nhimself has declared that he is attempting the impossible in trying to\r\nharmonize the discordant elements of the Democratic Party.\r\n\r\nWhat is the real statesmanship demanded at this time?\r\n\r\nThat those who believe in Jeffersonian ideals, whether they are now\r\nin the Republican, Democratic, Populist or Socialist parties, should\r\ncome together without prejudice for party names, and should unite in\r\nthe common cause of driving from power the beneficiaries of class\r\nlegislation, no matter whether those beneficiaries are called Democrats\r\nor Republicans.\r\n\r\nLet the Belmonts and Morgans get together in the same party so that we\r\ncan fight them both at the same time.\r\n\r\nAs long as we cling to party differences and party names our efforts will\r\ncome to naught, as they did in 1896, 1900 and 1904.\r\n\r\nMr. Bryan wants the reform movement to stop and wait for him, while for\r\nfour years he struggles to get the better of the plutocratic element of\r\nhis own party. If they were able to wrest control from him when he had so\r\nmuch more advantage than he has now, how can we expect him to take that\r\ncontrol from their strong hands?\r\n\r\nBut, suppose he does succeed in defeating the Belmont-Cleveland element\r\nin the convention of 1908, does he not know that they will fulfil his\r\nprediction again and knife him as they have done twice already?\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, suppose they conquer him in 1908 as they did in 1904,\r\nwill he not submit tamely to kiss the hand that smote him as he did in\r\nthe last convention? Most assuredly he will.\r\n\r\nHe lost his opportunity to fly the flag of revolt when he failed to\r\nresent the Gold Telegram of 1904. That opportunity passed, never to\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nAbsolutely the only hope of radical reform lies in a straight-out,\r\naggressive and fearless _fight upon both the old parties_, which in turn\r\nhave had control of the Government, and which have played into each\r\nother’s hands in forging the chains of class legislation which now bind\r\nand burden the Common People.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Is It Paul Jones’s Body?_\r\n\r\nHave they found the body of John Paul Jones?\r\n\r\nThe experts say that they have.\r\n\r\nTo the legal mind, the fact that _experts_ had to be called in to pass\r\nupon the question of identity is sufficient to arouse suspicion and\r\nprovoke investigation.\r\n\r\nAs stated in a former number, I was certain they would find Paul Jones—in\r\ntheir minds—for that was what they were looking for.\r\n\r\nWhenever, for instance, the medical expert starts out to find arsenic in\r\nthe human stomach, arsenic generally shows up all right enough.\r\n\r\nIn like manner French experts were called in to identify a certain corpse\r\nas that of Paul Jones, and, after the most elaborate and beautifully\r\nregular formalities, they solemnly pronounced the verdict which they knew\r\nwas expected and which they were predisposed to find.\r\n\r\n“This is Paul Jones, isn’t it?” asks General Porter, most suavely, not to\r\nsay persuasively.\r\n\r\nHow could the politest experts of the politest people on earth say nay?\r\n\r\nThe case was pitiful.\r\n\r\nThe search for Paul Jones’s body had reached a crisis. Only four leaden\r\ncoffins had been found in the old graveyard, and one of these _had_ to be\r\nPaul Jones, because he had been buried in such a coffin, and the other\r\nthree bore name-plates which showed they could not be his.\r\n\r\nThe fourth bore no name-plate; therefore it _must_ be Jones’s coffin.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of the situation required it.\r\n\r\nConsequently, polite French experts measure, compare, incubate, decide\r\nand bring in the verdict desired.\r\n\r\nLooking at the matter as a lawyer, I should say that there is not\r\nsufficient legal evidence offered, as yet, to establish the identity of\r\nthe dead body.\r\n\r\nThe cemetery in which Commodore Paul Jones was buried was closed by law\r\nin 1793.\r\n\r\n_A canal was afterward cut through it._\r\n\r\nThe great sea-fighter was buried, as Napoleon was, in uniform.\r\n\r\nIn the Life of him—“Great Commanders’ Series”—by Cyrus Townsend Brady,\r\nthe statement is made that _Paul Jones was buried in the American\r\nuniform_, and that _a sword and other articles were placed in the coffin_.\r\n\r\nThe body which General Porter has found was _not_ clad in uniform.\r\n\r\nThere was no sword, or other article, found in the coffin.\r\n\r\nCommodore Jones died of dropsy, which had swollen his body to such an\r\nextent that he could not button his waistcoat.\r\n\r\nYet the French experts declare that all the measurements tally exactly\r\nwith those of the living Jones.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Should They Do So?_\r\n\r\nAwful changes take place after death, and they are greater with some than\r\nwith others.\r\n\r\nShould the measurements of a corpse which had been entombed more than\r\na hundred years correspond _exactly_ with those of the same body when\r\nalive?\r\n\r\nMost biographers put the _height_ of Admiral Jones at “about five feet\r\nand eight inches.”\r\n\r\nWon’t you find a greater number of men—in France especially—whose height\r\nis “about five feet eight inches” than you’ll find at any other figure?\r\n\r\nAnd will you not find more _corpses_ of about that length?\r\n\r\nYet in these measurements consists the whole of the testimony which has\r\nbeen offered to the American people to convince them that the body of\r\nPaul Jones is at last to come home.\r\n\r\nUnless the matter of the uniform and the sword be cleared up, it is\r\nimpossible to accept the conclusion arrived at by the experts.\r\n\r\nThis corpse may be, as already stated, a good enough Jones for that\r\n$35,000, but it has not yet been shown to be John Paul Jones, the naval\r\nhero of our War of Independence.\r\n\r\n\r\n                _Is the Black Man Superior to the White?_\r\n\r\nWith statistics one can prove many things—the conclusion arrived at\r\ndepending, in all cases, considerably upon the man behind the figures.\r\n\r\nThis time the man behind the figures is Doctor Booker Washington—may his\r\nshadow never grow less!\r\n\r\nIn the course of a recent lecture, the learned Doctor laid down the\r\nproposition that the black man is superior to the white, and he proved\r\nit—proved it by statistics.\r\n\r\nHe said that there is 85 per cent. of illiteracy among the Spaniards,\r\nwhile there is only 54 per cent. of illiteracy among the negroes;\r\ntherefore the negroes are clearly more advanced in civilization than the\r\nSpaniards.\r\n\r\nPoor old Spain!\r\n\r\nThe learned Doctor further demonstrated that there is 65 per cent. of\r\nilliteracy among the Italians; therefore the negroes are far ahead\r\nof Italy. Russian illiteracy being 70 per cent. the black man takes\r\nprecedence of the land of Peter the Great, Skobelef, Gorky, Turgenef and\r\nTolstoy. South America, having an illiteracy of 80 per cent., falls far\r\nto the rear of the negro—and Castro must add this additional kick to the\r\nmany he has already received from North America.\r\n\r\nProud of his statistics, Doctor Booker Washington exclaims: “_The negro\r\nrace has developed more rapidly in the thirty years of its freedom than\r\nthe Latin race has in one thousand years of freedom._”\r\n\r\nThat’s a bold statement, Doctor.\r\n\r\nTo say nothing of its accuracy, may it not have been an unwise thing\r\nfor you to claim that the black man has risen during thirty years more\r\nrapidly in the scale of civilization than the whites have risen in a\r\nthousand?\r\n\r\nTrue, you confine yourself to the Italians, the Spaniards, the Russians\r\nand the South Americans, but when you say the darkest of all the colored\r\nraces is superior to that great section of the white race named by you,\r\ndoes it not occur to you that you may create a feeling of resentment\r\namong _all_ the whites?\r\n\r\nYou have thousands of true friends throughout the entire country—white\r\nmen who have most generously helped you in your work, helped you\r\nwith money, with moral support and with a certain amount of social\r\nrecognition. Your admirers refer to you as a great man. They allude to\r\nyour work as a great work. The South helps you with appropriations, just\r\nas the North helps you with donations. We want to see you succeed in\r\nbuilding up your race.\r\n\r\nBut have you a single white friend who will indorse your statement\r\nthat the black race is so superior to the whites that it can do in one\r\ngeneration what it required the whites a thousand years to do?\r\n\r\nDo you imagine that your friends, President Roosevelt, Mr. Carnegie, Dr.\r\nHart, Bishop Potter, and others, will like you better when they hear you\r\nputting forth a claim to race superiority? Doctor, you have overshot the\r\nmark.\r\n\r\n_Whenever the North wakes up to the fact that you are teaching the blacks\r\nthat they are superior to the whites, you are going to feel the east\r\nwind._\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean by racial development, Doctor?\r\n\r\nApparently your standard of measurement is illiteracy. That is to say, if\r\na greater number of negroes than of Spaniards can read, then the negro\r\nhas achieved a higher plane in civilization.\r\n\r\nIs that your idea? Does the ability to read constitute race development?\r\n\r\nAccording to that, a million negro children attend school twelve months\r\nand become “civilized” because they have learned to spell “Baker” and to\r\nread “Mary had a little lamb.”\r\n\r\nDoes it not strike you, Doctor, that such a measure might be delusive?\r\n\r\nIn making up your tables of illiteracy, why didn’t you include _all the\r\nnegroes_, as you included _all_ the Italians, _all_ the Spaniards, _all_\r\nthe Russians?\r\n\r\nWhy leave out your home folks in Africa, Doctor?\r\n\r\nWhy omit Santo Domingo and Haiti?\r\n\r\nIf you will number _all_ the negroes, Doctor, your percentage of\r\nilliteracy _among the blacks_ may run up among the nineties, and knock\r\nyour calculation into a cocked hat.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the West Indies God poured His blessings with lavish hand upon the\r\nisland of Haiti. The French went there and built up a civilization. The\r\nRevolution of 1789 freed the negroes who were held in slavery by the\r\nwhites, and civil war soon followed.\r\n\r\nThe blacks outnumbered the whites and the climate was their ally. Yellow\r\nfever did for them what frost did for the Russians when Napoleon struck\r\nat their liberties. They achieved freedom, and they have had it, not for\r\nthirty years, but for a hundred years.\r\n\r\n_What have your people done with their freedom in Santo Domingo,\r\nDoctor?_ Back, back into barbarism, voodooism, human sacrifice, social\r\nand political anarchy they have plunged; and their history is one long\r\nblood-stained record of backsliding from the standard which the French\r\nhad already established. Even now your black brethren in Santo Domingo\r\nare beseeching the white man of the United States to do that which they\r\nare unable to do—administer national affairs. In self-defense this\r\nGovernment may have to treat Santo Domingo as Great Britain treats\r\nJamaica, both governments acting upon the demonstrated fact that the\r\nblacks, _left to themselves_, are incapable of self-government and race\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut before entering into a comparison of racial progress, Doctor, it\r\nis in order to note the fact that you accredit the negro with only\r\nthirty years of freedom. Why, Doctor, _the negro race, as a race, has\r\nenjoyed just as long a period of freedom as the Celts, the Latins, the\r\nAnglo-Saxons and the Slavs_.\r\n\r\nThe black race in Africa was as free as the Indian race in North America.\r\n\r\nDuring the thousand years in which the whites were painfully creating\r\nthe civilization which _you_ now enjoy, _your_ race, in its native home,\r\nwas doing pretty much the same things which the red race was doing in\r\nNorth America. Your people were running about in the woods, naked, eating\r\nraw meat, eternally at war—tribe with tribe—steeped in ignorance, vice\r\nand superstition, with an occasional lapse into human sacrifice and\r\ncannibalism.\r\n\r\n_Your race, as a race, is free now in Africa, as it has been since the\r\ndawn of history:—where is the civilization which it worked out for\r\nitself?_ It does not exist; it never did exist.\r\n\r\nThe negro has been absolutely unable to develop as a race when left to\r\nhimself. Nowhere, at any time, has he developed a system of agriculture,\r\nor commerce, or manufactures, made headway in mining or engineering, or\r\nconceived a system of finance. Never has he produced a system of laws,\r\ninstitutions of state, religious organization, or worked out a political\r\nideal. Never has he created a literature, or developed original capacity\r\nfor the fine arts. His foot has never even crossed the threshold of the\r\nworld of creative painting, sculpture, music, architecture Into the\r\nrealms of science, in the domain of original thought, in the higher\r\nreaches of mental power where the human mind grapples with vast problems,\r\nmaterial and spiritual, the problems of time and eternity, the negro has\r\nnever entered. No word has ever fallen from his lips that was not the\r\necho of what some white man had already said. He has sometimes _put his\r\nfoot in the white man’s track_, but that is the best he has ever done.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCompare this imitative race with the great Latin stock—a stock from\r\nwhich sprang Rienzi and Garibaldi, Cavour and Napoleon, Da Vinci and\r\nGalileo, Savonarola and Leo the Tenth, Titian and Bellini, Raphael and\r\nMichelangelo.\r\n\r\nThe Latin race, whether in Spain, Italy or South America, has developed\r\nsystems of agriculture, finance, commerce, manufactures, education,\r\nreligion, government—has created literature, laws and institutions of\r\nstate, has evidenced capacity in science and art.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe negroes superior to the Latins?\r\n\r\nHeavens above!\r\n\r\nDuring the thousand years which Doctor Washington says that the Latins\r\nhave done less than the negroes have done in thirty, Spain rose into\r\nworld-power, dominated the European Continent, shook England’s throne to\r\nits base, broke the Turkish scimiter in the great sea-fight of Lepanto,\r\nevolved a splendid literature, reached the highest development in the\r\nFine Arts, launched Columbus upon his voyage into unknown seas to test\r\nthe suggestion of another Latin—Toscanelli—and thus took the first daring\r\nstep in that marvelous chapter of Discovery whose sober facts are grander\r\nand stranger than Romance.\r\n\r\nHas the learned Doctor ever studied the history of Mexico—the Latin\r\ncountry south of us?\r\n\r\nSince a foreign yoke was thrown off and Mexico “found herself,” what\r\ncountry has made nobler progress?\r\n\r\nThe negro in Santo Domingo has had a hundred years of freedom; Mexico\r\nscarce half so many; _yet compare the Mexico of today with the Santo\r\nDomingo of today._ Left to themselves, the Latins of Mexico have built up\r\na magnificent civilization.\r\n\r\nLeft to themselves, the negroes of Santo Domingo have destroyed what the\r\nFrench had already built.\r\n\r\n_In Mexico conditions get better, year after year._\r\n\r\n_In Santo Domingo conditions grow worse, year after year._\r\n\r\nIf the learned Doctor wants to make a study in contrasts, let him first\r\nread “Where Black Rules White,” by Hesketh Prichard, and then read “The\r\nAwakening of a Nation,” by Charles F. Lummis, and I venture to say that\r\nsome of his cocky self-complacency as to the superiority of the negroes\r\nover the whites will ooze out of him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs to Italy—can it be that Italy has done less in a thousand years than\r\nthe negroes have done in thirty?\r\n\r\nThe greatest man that ever lived was of Italian extraction. Taine says\r\nthat Napoleon was a true Italian in character and intellect. If that\r\nbe true, then _the two greatest men the world ever saw_ were Latins.\r\nWherever the civilized man lives today his environment, his thoughts, his\r\nideals, his achievements are more or less influenced by the life and work\r\nof Cæsar and Napoleon.\r\n\r\nIf any two men may be said to have created the material modern world\r\nthose two Latins did it.\r\n\r\nIf modern Europe is any one man, it is Napoleon. His laws,\r\nschools—social, political, financial, educational institutions—have wrung\r\nfrom rulers ever since the homage of imitation.\r\n\r\nIn literature how illustrious is Italy?\r\n\r\nIt was Petrarch who was “the Columbus of a new spiritual atmosphere, the\r\ndiscoverer of modern culture.”\r\n\r\nIt was he who broke away from monkish medievalism, created the humanistic\r\nimpulse, treated “man as a rational being apart from theological\r\ndetermination,” modernizing literature.\r\n\r\nThe “short story” writers of fiction—Edgar Poe, Guy de Maupassant and\r\nKipling—had their teacher in Boccaccio and his _novella_.\r\n\r\nModern history traces its methods, its spirit and its form to Villani,\r\nGuicciardini, and that wonderful type of Latin genius, Machiavelli.\r\n\r\n_The whole world goes to school to the Latins!_\r\n\r\nNo painter hopes to excel Correggio, Paul Veronese, Antonio Allegro,\r\nTintoretto, Velasquez, Murillo. No sculptor expects to eclipse Niccola\r\nPisano, Orvieto, Orcagna or Luca della Robbia.\r\n\r\nNo worker in gold, silver and bronze believes he can surpass Ghiberti,\r\nCellini and Donatello.\r\n\r\nArchitects the world over despair of rivaling Alberti, Bramante, Giulo\r\nRomano, Palladio.\r\n\r\nThese masters were masters to their own generation, four and five hundred\r\nyears ago; they have been masters ever since; they are masters still.\r\n\r\nWherever civilization extends its frontiers these deathless Latins are\r\nin the van—teaching what Truth and Beauty are, refining the thoughts,\r\nelevating the ideals, improving the methods, inspiring the efforts of man.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The negroes have done more than this, and in thirty years?_\r\n\r\nYou had forgotten the Renaissance, hadn’t you, Doctor?\r\n\r\nAsia was decaying, Africa was in its normal state of savagery, Europe lay\r\ntorpid under the weight of ignorance and superstition. Where learning\r\nexisted at all its spirit was dull, its form heavy, its progress fettered\r\nby ancient canons and cumbrous vestments.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the Angel of Light—her face a radiance, her presence an\r\ninspiration—puts a silver trumpet to her lips and blows, blows, till all\r\nthe world of white men hears the thrilling notes.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! there is a resurrection! What was best in the learning of the\r\npast becomes young again, and ministers to the minds of men.\r\n\r\nLiterature springs to life, throws off antiquated dress, and takes\r\nits graceful modern form. The fine arts flourish as never before; the\r\ncanvas, the marble, the precious metal, feel the subtle touch of the\r\neager artist, and give birth to beauty which is immortal. The heavy\r\nprison-castle of the Frank, the Goth, the Norman, the Anglo-Saxon,\r\nretires abashed before the elegant, airy, poetic palace of the\r\nRenaissance.\r\n\r\nNor does the revival of learning limit itself to literature,\r\narchitecture, painting, sculpture. It extends to law, to commerce, to\r\nagriculture, to religion, to education.\r\n\r\nWhence came the Renaissance, Doctor Washington? Whence came that mighty\r\nrevival of intellectual splendor which still influences the world? From\r\nthe Latin race, which you affect to despise. From these Italians whom you\r\nsay are so inferior in development to the negro.\r\n\r\nItaly led the modern world in almost everything which we call\r\ncivilization—she is today one of the world’s most inspiring teachers,\r\nnor will her power for good be gone till the Christian religion is\r\nrepudiated, the voice of music hushed, the wand of literature broken, the\r\nforce of law defied, the witchery of art lost to the minds, the hearts\r\nand the souls of men.\r\n\r\nAnd yet Doctor Washington asserts, to one audience after another,\r\nthat those glorious achievements of the Latins, the Italians, these\r\nimperishable and ever potent achievements of a thousand years, are\r\nexceeded by what the negroes have done in thirty years!\r\n\r\nFrom the Latin England took her religious organization, as Germany and\r\nAustria and France had done. Through the Latin the classic literature of\r\nGreece and earlier Rome came into the modern world—an eternal debt which\r\nwe owe mainly to Petrarch.\r\n\r\nThe Bourbon kings imported from Italy the architects, painters,\r\nsculptors, landscape gardeners, who laid upon uncouth feudal France the\r\nrich mantle of Italian beauty.\r\n\r\nIt was the Latin who taught modern Europe how to farm, how to irrigate,\r\nhow to engrave, how to make paper from rags, how to bridge the rivers,\r\nhow to pave the streets, how to make canals.\r\n\r\nSome of Shakespeare’s plays are elaborations and dramatizations of\r\nItalian _novellas_. Chaucer, the father of English poetry, frankly copied\r\nfrom the Italian model.\r\n\r\nMilton had Dante for pioneer, Spenser had Ariosto, and Byron’s best work\r\nis in the Italian form.\r\n\r\nI presume, Doctor, that at this season of the year you are copying the\r\nstyle of the white man, and that you are wearing a straw hat.\r\n\r\nWell, the Latins taught us how to make straw hats.\r\n\r\nI presume that you recognize the value of _glass_—one of whose hundreds\r\nof uses is to show you how you look.\r\n\r\nWell, the Latin taught us how to make glass.\r\n\r\nI presume you realize how much the modern world, during the last thousand\r\nyears, has been indebted to the modern ship.\r\n\r\nWell, the Latin taught the Anglo-Saxon how to build modern ships.\r\n\r\nI presume you appreciate good rice, Doctor.\r\n\r\nWell, the seed of the heavy upland rice which we have in this\r\ncountry was brought out of Italy in the pockets of Thomas\r\nJefferson—gentleman-smuggler in that instance.\r\n\r\nI presume you will wear pink silk undergarments this season as usual,\r\nwon’t you, Doctor?\r\n\r\nWell, the Latin taught modern Europe how to make and use silk.\r\n\r\nAnd remember that the Latin took the clumsy musical instruments of the\r\nancient world and fashioned them into the perfect forms of the present\r\ntime; and that the Italians, whom you despise, had created the violin\r\nwhile your race was “rattling the bones” and gradually climbing toward\r\nthe “cakewalk.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat has the negro in these United States been doing for the last thirty\r\nyears, Doctor?\r\n\r\n_Copying the white man._ That’s all.\r\n\r\nHe has simply been imitating, as best he could, the dress, the talk, the\r\nmanners, the methods, the work of the whites.\r\n\r\nThe Latin whites _originated_ a civilization; the negroes are _copying_\r\none. Is there no difference between the higher genius which conceives and\r\nthe lower talent which copies?\r\n\r\nIt required the genius of Raphael to conceive and paint “The\r\nTransfiguration.” Any ordinary artist can make a fair copy of it. But\r\ndoes anyone compare the copyist with the original artist? It required\r\nthe genius of Sangallo and Michelangelo to rear St. Peter’s at Rome: any\r\nwell-educated architect of today might rear its duplicate. But would that\r\nmake the modern architect equal to the two Italian masters?\r\n\r\nTen thousand negro men and women may be able to sit down at the piano and\r\nrender Verdi’s “Il Trovatore,” but does that entitle the negroes to class\r\nthemselves with the Italian composer?\r\n\r\nMy thought is this—the negro, assisted in every possible way by the\r\nwhites, is copying the ways and learning the arts of the white man; _but\r\nthe fact that he can learn to read the white man’s book does not make\r\nhim the equal of the white race which produced the book._ The fact that\r\nhe may learn from us how to practice law or medicine does not make him\r\nequal to the white race which _created_ the code of laws and the science\r\nof medicine. It may have required a thousand years _for us to learn_ that\r\nwhich we can _teach him in one year_, but the point is that the negro,\r\nin his native home, had just as much time and opportunity to evolve a\r\ncivilization as we had, AND HE DID NOT DO IT.\r\n\r\nLet me repeat to you, Doctor, the unvarnished truth—for it may do you\r\ngood:\r\n\r\nThe advance made by your race in America is _the reflection_ of the white\r\nman’s civilization. Just that and nothing more. The negro lives in the\r\nlight of the white man’s civilization and _reflects a part of that light_.\r\n\r\nHe imitates an example kept before his eyes; copies models never out of\r\nhis sight; echoes the words the white man utters; patterns after the\r\nmanners and the methods of the whites around him, and thus _reflects_\r\nour civilization.\r\n\r\nHe has originated nothing, and if the copy, the pattern, the example were\r\ntaken away he would fall back as he did in Haiti.\r\n\r\nHe has never either evolved nor sustained a civilization of his own.\r\n\r\nFortunately for the _Afro-American_, he finds himself better situated\r\nthan his brethren elsewhere. In Africa and Haiti _they_ have to scuffle\r\n_for themselves_. Result—barbarism.\r\n\r\nIn America _he_ swells the ranks of civilization’s advancing army, and he\r\n_has_ to go forward. We not only support him with aid of all sorts, we\r\nnot only give him daily precept and example, but we _compel_ him to live\r\na better life than he would live in Africa and Haiti. This compulsion\r\nis of two kinds, the fear of punishment and the hope of reward—thus\r\nenlisting two of the most powerful passions of the human being.\r\n\r\nIt should be significant to Doctor Washington that the only portion of\r\nhis race which has ever made any development is that which has the vast\r\nadvantage of being sustained, encouraged, taught, led and _coerced_ by\r\nthe whites among whom they live.\r\n\r\nNot long ago a negro preacher whose self-appreciation was as great as\r\nthat of Doctor Washington went out to Liberia to subdue the heathen, in\r\nthe home of the negro race.\r\n\r\nThe heathen were not subdued, but the preacher was. He threw off his\r\nstore clothes, gave a whoop, gathered up an armful of wives and broke for\r\nthe woods; the “Call of the Wild” was too much for his newly soldered\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nNow, I don’t mean to say that Doctor Washington would relapse,\r\nunder similar circumstances; but when I hear him call his new race\r\n_Afro-Americans_ and listen while he soberly tells them that _they are\r\nsuperior to the whites_, I beg that he will remember his kin across the\r\nsea, his brethren in Santo Domingo, the decadents of Liberia, and the\r\ntens of thousands of his race here in this country who devoutly believe\r\nin witch doctors, in ghosts, in the conjure bag, and in the power of one\r\nnegro to undo another by the mysterious but invincible “Trick.”\r\n\r\nRemember this, Doctor, education is a good thing, but _it never did, and\r\nnever will, alter the essential character of a man or a race_.\r\n\r\nOf course, Doctor, if you think your race the equal of ours, you have the\r\nright to say it. It’s a free country, you know.\r\n\r\nBut, really, you ought not to “crowd the monkey” by putting in a claim\r\nfor superiority.\r\n\r\n_Such a claim does your race no good._\r\n\r\nIt _may_ do them harm. It may cultivate a spirit of truculent\r\nself-assertion which even your warmest admirers, North and South, might\r\nfind it hard to tolerate.\r\n\r\nIn the “History of Civilization,” Buckle says:\r\n\r\n“Above all this, there is a far higher movement; and as the tide rolls\r\non, now advancing, now receding, there is, amid its endless fluctuations,\r\none thing, and one alone, which endures forever. The actions of bad men\r\nproduce only temporary evil, the actions of good men only temporary good;\r\nand eventually the good and the evil altogether subside, are neutralized\r\nby subsequent generations, absorbed by the incessant movement of future\r\nages. But the discoveries of great men never leave us; they are immortal,\r\nthey contain those eternal truths which survive the shock of empires,\r\noutlive the struggle of rival creeds and witness the decay of successive\r\nreligions. All _these_ have their different measures and their different\r\nstandards; one set of opinions for one age, another set for another.\r\n_They_ pass away like a dream; they are as a fabric of a vision, which\r\nleaves not a rack behind. _The discoveries of genius alone remain_: it\r\nis to _them_ we owe all that we now have, _they_ are for all ages and\r\nfor all times; never young, and never old, _they_ bear the seeds of\r\ntheir own life, they flow on in a perennial and undying stream; _they_\r\nare essentially cumulative, and giving birth to the additions which they\r\nsubsequently receive, _they thus influence the most distant posterity,\r\nand after the lapse of centuries produce more effect than they were able\r\nto do even at the moment of their promulgation._”\r\n\r\nNoble lines!\r\n\r\nAnd amid these “discoveries of genius” to which “we owe all that we now\r\nhave,” bearing the seeds of intellectual life and improvement to “the\r\nmost distant posterity” what treasures are richer than those which the\r\nLatin brings?\r\n\r\nArchitecture, Agriculture, Manufactures, Commerce, Civil Engineering,\r\nFinance, Legislation, Religious Organization, Sculpture, Painting, Music,\r\nLiterature, Science, the wedding of the Fine Arts to Religion—in each and\r\nevery one of these fields _his_ genius has been creative and masterful.\r\n\r\n_Upon our civilization the Latin has imposed, as an everlasting blessing,\r\nan imperishable Public Debt._\r\n\r\nWhat does civilization owe to the negro?\r\n\r\nNothing!\r\n\r\n_Nothing!!_\r\n\r\nNOTHING!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Amending the Constitution_\r\n\r\nI am not one of those who believe that the Constitution of the United\r\nStates is a flawless piece of workmanship.\r\n\r\nIt was not so considered by those who made it nor by those who adopted\r\nit. It never would have been ratified had it not been that amendments\r\nwere promised and misrepresentation made as to the character of the\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\nThere has been a great deal of discussion recently about making a new\r\nConstitution or amending the old.\r\n\r\nWhen the Constitution was adopted _a government was created_ of which the\r\nConstitution is the supreme law, and _this cannot be changed except in\r\nthe manner prescribed in the instrument itself_.\r\n\r\nIf two-thirds of the states composing the Union, acting through their\r\nlegislatures, shall apply to Congress for “a Constitutional convention\r\nfor proposing amendments,” and these amendments should be ratified by\r\nthree-fourths of the states, then a practically new Constitution might be\r\nframed; but in no other legal way could the people alter the fundamental\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nCongress can take the initiative by a vote of two-thirds of both Houses,\r\nand can propose amendments which, if adopted by three-fourths of the\r\nstates, would become a part of the Constitution; but it must occur to all\r\nthat this method of effecting reform is slow and cumbrous to the last\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\n_The framers of the Constitution meant that it should be so._\r\n\r\nIn a very able article in the last number of this magazine Mr. Frederick\r\nUpham Adams discusses the necessity for amendments to the Constitution.\r\n\r\nHe cites four changes that should be made.\r\n\r\nFirst.—The election of President and Vice-President should not be decided\r\nby a majority of the states, but by a majority of the people.\r\n\r\nSecond.—United States Senators should not be elected by legislatures, but\r\nby direct vote of the people of the states.\r\n\r\nThird.—The states should be represented in the Senate according to\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nFourth.—The powers and functions of the Federal Judiciary should be\r\nenumerated and limited.\r\n\r\nI heartily concur with Mr. Adams in his view of the Federal Judiciary. It\r\nhas usurped functions and powers unprecedented in the history of judicial\r\ntribunals.\r\n\r\nIn order to change the character of the government at Athens from an\r\naristocracy to a democracy Solon gave the people control of the courts,\r\nwhich _exercised the supreme power over laws and men_. Aristotle says\r\nthat by this method the people established a democracy where there had\r\npreviously been an aristocracy. The aristocrat controlled the lawmaking\r\npower, but as the people controlled the judiciary a pure democracy\r\nresulted.\r\n\r\nAlexander Hamilton used the same device _for the opposite purpose_.\r\nHe took away from the people and put into the hands of the aristocracy\r\n_the supreme control over our laws and rulers_, and our judiciary,\r\nthus controlled, has changed the United States, which under the old\r\nConfederation was a democracy, into an aristocracy.\r\n\r\nIt will require a Constitutional amendment to drive the usurpers from the\r\nhigh place in which they are entrenched, but such an amendment cannot\r\npossibly be passed through the _Upper House of Congress_ and through\r\nthe _Upper Houses of three-fourths of the states_ until a tremendous\r\nrevolution shall have taken place in public sentiment.\r\n\r\nIf we should attempt to curtail the powers of the Federal Judges by\r\nConstitutional amendment we should surely find “Jordan a hard road to\r\ntravel.” Most of us would be dead and forgotten before the purpose could\r\nbe reached by that route.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, can be done?\r\n\r\n_The swiftest remedy for the evil lies in the election of a President who\r\nwill_ ASSERT HIS EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY.\r\n\r\nThe very essence of our system of government is the _Balance of Power_.\r\nThe Legislative function should not encroach upon the Judicial; the\r\nExecutive should not invade the Legislative, and the Judicial should not\r\nusurp prerogatives belonging to the other two.\r\n\r\n_Inherent in each of these three departments of government lies the power\r\nof self-defense._\r\n\r\nJust as the Government, as a whole, has the inherent, inalienable right\r\nof self-preservation against external or internal attack, so each of the\r\nthree separate departments of the Government has the inherent right of\r\nself-preservation as against an attack from either one or both of the\r\nother two.\r\n\r\nWhen John Marshall made the attempt to encroach upon the Executive,\r\nduring the administration of Mr. Jefferson, the President treated the\r\nCourt with contempt, and the Court was powerless to go forward. When the\r\nsame partisan Judge made a decision against the state of Georgia, which\r\nPresident Andrew Jackson considered unjust, the Executive refused to\r\nsupport the Judiciary, and the decision came to naught.\r\n\r\nWhen Chief-Justice Taney, during President Lincoln’s administration,\r\nencroached, as the President thought, upon the Executive, the Judiciary\r\nagain came to grief.\r\n\r\n_Had Mr. Cleveland been at heart in favor of the Income tax of 1893, the\r\nSupreme Court would never have dared to pronounce against it._\r\n\r\nThat law was based upon a principle which the Supreme Court had indorsed\r\nfor a hundred years, and the first deliverance of the Judges upon the act\r\nof 1893 was favorable to it.\r\n\r\nThat act was the outcome of the work of the Legislative department\r\nacting within the scope of its authority. The Executive department had\r\nsanctioned the act, and it had become LAW.\r\n\r\nHad Cleveland boldly announced his purpose to _execute that law, by\r\nvirtue of his inherent power as Chief Executive_, the Supreme Court would\r\nnever have made the second decision, which was a national scandal.\r\n\r\nBy that decision the accumulated wealth of the millionaires is exempted\r\nfrom taxation—relieved of the duty of contributing to the support of the\r\nGovernment by whose unjust laws those millions were accumulated.\r\n\r\nBut let the people really get in power; let them really elect a\r\nPresident; let them place in authority another Andrew Jackson, who isn’t\r\nafraid to show his friendship for the common man and his animosity to\r\nthe greedy corporation—_then_ you will see the Supreme Court draw in its\r\nhorns.\r\n\r\nFederal Judges are human like the rest of us, and they know with\r\nconsiderable accuracy which side their bread is buttered on.\r\n\r\n_Get the right sort of man in the Executive Chair, get the right sort of\r\nmen in Congress, create the right sort of public opinion, and I venture\r\nthe prediction that the Federal Judiciary will not attempt the role of\r\nDame Partington without meeting with the same luck._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI agree with Mr. Adams also that Senators should be elected by the direct\r\nvote of the people in each state, but he is perhaps in error when he\r\nsays that the system of electing Senators by state legislatures is “the\r\nfountain head of the corruption of American politics.”\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, there never could have been a corrupt Senate until there\r\nwas a corrupt Legislature. When New Jersey sent to the Senate a man like\r\nJim Smith the Legislature of New Jersey had already become corrupt.\r\nWhen Pennsylvania sent to the Senate a man like Quay the Legislature of\r\nPennsylvania had already become corrupt. Standard Oil had to buy the Ohio\r\nLegislature before Henry B. Payne became United States Senator.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the corrupt Senator is simply the fruit of the tree of\r\nlegislative corruption, and the corrupt Legislature has been too often\r\nthe result of corrupt elections.\r\n\r\nWe might as well tell the truth, and the whole truth, while we are\r\ndiscussing the question. _Every one of us knows that elections of almost\r\nevery sort, from the highest to the lowest—town, county, state and\r\nnational—have been influenced by money and whisky, fraudulent practices\r\nof all sorts, the stuffed ballot-box, the doctored returns, and the God’s\r\ntruth about the matter is that the people themselves are, to a large\r\nextent, responsible for the kind of men who get into the Legislature,\r\ninto the House of Representatives and into the Senate._\r\n\r\nToo many of our honest men have shirked election duty, as they have\r\nshirked jury duty; and just as ignorant or corrupt juries too often\r\ndecide questions in the court house, so the ignorant or corrupt\r\nvoters—pliant tools in the hands of unscrupulous politicians—decide\r\nquestions of legislation which require the best thought and the best\r\nenergies of our most intelligent and upright citizens.\r\n\r\nIf direct legislation and the Recall should be put in practice, there\r\ncould not be such things as corrupt legislatures, and therefore there\r\nwould be no such thing as corrupt senatorial elections.\r\n\r\nThe fountain having been purified, the stream would be pure. At present\r\nthe fountain itself is too often impure, and therefore the stream which\r\nflows from it cannot be pure.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the other two points made by Mr. Adams there will be greater\r\ndifference of opinion. His objections proceed upon the assumption\r\nthat the United States is a nation with a government national in all\r\nparticulars. Here he is at fault.\r\n\r\nOur Government is only partially national. It is Federal, also, in part.\r\nIt is not altogether the one nor altogether the other.\r\n\r\nOurs is a peculiar system. To the foreign world we present the aspect\r\nof a sovereign nation. Among ourselves we are a collection of sovereign\r\nstates which, for purposes stated in the preamble of the Constitution,\r\nhave delegated to the central Government a portion of those powers which\r\nonce belonged entirely to those sovereign states.\r\n\r\nThe state government existed before the Federal Government came into\r\nbeing. If the Federal Government were abolished tomorrow, each one of\r\nthe states would still remain a sovereign state capable of conducting\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe state of Connecticut, for instance, was an independent republic when\r\nthere was no such thing as the United States.\r\n\r\nWould Connecticut ever have gone into an “indissoluble union” if she had\r\nnot been assured that this union was to be composed of “indestructible\r\nstates”? The two propositions are linked together in Constitutional law.\r\n\r\nAmong sovereigns all are, in law, equal, and each one of these states was\r\nsovereign at the time the union of states was formed.\r\n\r\nWould either of those independent sovereign states have accepted a place\r\nof inferiority in the Government? Assuredly not.\r\n\r\nThen how is the indestructibility of the states guaranteed in the\r\nConstitution? By giving the state, as a state, its full power in the\r\nUnited States Senate, and, in a smaller degree, in the election of Chief\r\nMagistrate.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution itself was modeled by delegates chosen, not by\r\ncitizens of the United States, _acting as individuals composing the\r\nentire nation_, but by voters acting as _citizens composing distinct\r\nand independent states to which they respectively belonged_. When the\r\ncompleted Constitution was referred back to the people for adoption, it\r\nwas not acted upon by them as citizens of the entire nation, but it was\r\nratified by each state, acting as a state, separate and distinct from\r\nevery other state. _Therefore the Constitution itself is the result, not\r\nof a national, but of a Federal act._\r\n\r\nMr. Madison himself took this ground in _The Federalist_. The facts all\r\nprove it.\r\n\r\nIn the exercise of its legislative powers the Federal Government is both\r\nnational and Federal. The House of Representatives is a national body,\r\nbecause it is composed of members chosen according to population. The\r\nSenate is a Federal body, because it is chosen by the states, acting as\r\nstates.\r\n\r\nThe executive department of our Government also combines in itself both\r\nthe national and the Federal features.\r\n\r\nThe Electoral College is composed of two messengers from each state, and\r\nalso of messengers equal in number to the members which the state has in\r\nthe House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nThe two messengers first mentioned correspond with the two Senators,\r\nand therefore represent the state in its Federal capacity. The other\r\nmessengers correspond with the Representatives of the state in the Lower\r\nHouse, and as the Lower House is national, so those messengers are\r\nnational.\r\n\r\nIf the people fail to elect a President, and the election is thrown into\r\nthe House of Representatives, _this House, which in its organization as\r\na legislative body is national, at once becomes Federal, because each\r\nstate has one vote, and the voice of Ohio or Pennsylvania is not more\r\npotent than that of Rhode Island or Delaware_.\r\n\r\nIt is only when our Government comes to put its laws into operation that\r\nit is purely national.\r\n\r\nIt is not strictly correct, politically or legally, to say that the\r\nUnited States is a nation, for a nation does not properly exist when the\r\nGovernment is one of limited power. That our Government is one of limited\r\npower, absolute only within the sphere of action granted to it by the\r\nstates, cannot be denied. While secession has been forever decided as not\r\nbeing among the reserved rights of the states, there are very many other\r\nreserved rights which still belong to the states, and which always should\r\nbe retained.\r\n\r\nAs the Washington _Post_ remarked some time since: “The United States\r\nhas not a single voter, and does not hold elections for any office. _All\r\nelections are state elections._”\r\n\r\nAlready there has been too much concentration of power in the central\r\nGovernment. To take away from the states their power of selecting\r\nSenators would be nothing short of revolution, and would lead to such a\r\nconsolidation of power as would entirely change the form and spirit of\r\nour Government.\r\n\r\nIf the principles of Populism grow strong enough to carry the large\r\nstates they will probably be found strong enough to carry the small\r\nstates. If they be found strong enough to control the state elections,\r\nthey will control national offices, because, as the Washington Post very\r\naptly points out, _the Federal Government holds no elections and has\r\nno voters_: it is the state that holds the election and furnishes the\r\nvoters; it is the state that prescribes the limits of the franchise,\r\nand says how, when, where and by whom these elections shall be held;\r\n_and even the Federal Judiciary has not yet ventured to infringe in the\r\nslightest degree upon that reserved right of the separate states_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the equal representation of the states in the Senate, Mr.\r\nAdams says, “_This vicious compromise was made in the Constitutional\r\nConvention as the price for the perpetuation of slavery._”\r\n\r\nThis compromise he characterizes further as “_cowardly and unfair_.” And\r\nhe adds: “Now that the logic of events has made this a nation, despite\r\nthe restrictive clauses of the Constitution, the dual participation of\r\nthe unrepresentative Senate is so grotesque that its continuance is\r\nfraught with a danger which at any time is likely to precipitate civil\r\nwar.”\r\n\r\nIs Mr. Adams quite sure that “this vicious compromise was the price of\r\nthe perpetuation of slavery”?\r\n\r\nOf course, I knew in a general way that slavery had been responsible\r\nfor pretty nearly every mean old thing that has ever happened to this\r\ncountry; and it has always grieved me, with more or less poignancy, that\r\nNew England could not have _foreseen_ that she couldn’t make slavery\r\npay. We lost much precious time while she was discovering that she\r\ncouldn’t. When at length she _did_ discover that there was no money in\r\nit for _her_, she thoughtfully sold most of her slaves, and went in for\r\nEmancipation.\r\n\r\n_Then_, to be sure, the sacred “Cause of Freedom” advanced at a gallop;\r\nbut, as I said, we had lost a good deal of time waiting for New England\r\nto make her experiment, and a good deal of unhappiness resulted.\r\n\r\nBut while I knew all this, in a general way, I really was not aware\r\nthat the slave-owning states in the Constitutional Convention forced\r\nWashington, Madison, Franklin and Randolph to act in the cowardly and\r\nvicious manner described by Mr. Adams.\r\n\r\nThe state of Virginia bitterly opposed the equal representation of the\r\nstates in the Senate. This was strange conduct in Virginia, if the\r\npurpose of that compromise was the “perpetuation of slavery.”\r\n\r\nThe state of New Jersey was the leader of those states in the convention\r\nwhich demanded equal representation in the Senate. If that senatorial\r\nequality was intended to perpetuate slavery, New Jersey’s attitude was\r\nmost peculiar.\r\n\r\nThis compromise which Mr. Adams calls “vicious, cowardly and unfair” is\r\nknown to constitutional history as _the Connecticut Compromise_. The men\r\nwho championed it most ably were Roger Sherman and Oliver Ellsworth. Were\r\nthese men actuated by a desire to perpetuate slavery?\r\n\r\nAll the books which I have read upon the subject state that equal\r\nrepresentation in the Senate was a compromise which _the smaller states\r\nwrung from the larger states, as the price of the union_, not the price\r\nof the “perpetuation of slavery.”\r\n\r\nNew Jersey, Connecticut and Delaware were afraid to give up their\r\nindependent, sovereign existence as states and to go into a union\r\nwhere the large states, like Pennsylvania and Virginia, would have so\r\nmuch greater power than themselves, if that power should be based on\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nWhen New Jersey refused to consider any plan of union which did not\r\nsafeguard the interests of the small states, she was not thinking of\r\nperpetuating slavery. When Roger Sherman and Oliver Ellsworth made such a\r\ndetermined fight to preserve, in part, the equality which then prevailed\r\namong the states, they were not thinking of perpetuating slavery. _Their\r\nmotive was to protect Connecticut, the small state, against Virginia and\r\nother large states._\r\n\r\nWhen Benjamin Franklin finally proposed that the Convention adopt the\r\nConnecticut idea, that aged philosopher and friend of human liberty was\r\nnot acting in the interest of the slave-owners.\r\n\r\nWhen Washington gave his consent, he was not guilty of cowardice and\r\nunfairness for the purpose of protecting slavery.\r\n\r\nThese men knew perfectly well that they were exceeding their authority in\r\nmaking a _new_ Constitution. They were sent there _to amend_ the Articles\r\nof Confederation; and when New Jersey, Connecticut and Delaware took the\r\nresolute position which was voiced by Patterson, Roger Sherman and Oliver\r\nEllsworth, Washington and Franklin both had sense enough to know that it\r\nwould be utter folly to go before the people, seeking a ratification of\r\n_a new Constitution_, unless the difference between big states and little\r\nstates had been first adjusted in the Constitutional Convention. Indeed,\r\nRhode Island, another small state, was so jealous of her rights that she\r\nrefused to send delegates to the Convention.\r\n\r\nMy authorities are Bancroft’s “History of the United States,” “The\r\nConstitutional History” of Landon, McMaster’s “With the Fathers,”\r\nHildreth’s “History of the United States,” Schouler’s “History of the\r\nUnited States.”\r\n\r\nThe latter historian says expressly that the compromise under discussion\r\n“_was secured through the determination of the smaller states not to\r\nyield entirely the rule of representation which the larger states were\r\nbent on invading_,” and, he adds, “_this compromise admirably preserves\r\nthe composite character of our system_.”\r\n\r\nThe historian declares that the smaller states expressly committed to the\r\nNew Jersey plan which sought to retain the sovereignty of the states were\r\nNew Jersey, Connecticut and Delaware.\r\n\r\nHildreth, in his “History of the United States,” takes the same position,\r\nand says: “The party of the smaller states, known also as the State\r\nRights Party, included the delegates from Connecticut, New Jersey,\r\nDelaware and a majority of those from Maryland and New York.\r\n\r\n“The party of the larger states, or National Party, included not only\r\n_the delegates from Virginia, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania_, but also\r\nthose from _the two Carolinas and Georgia_, states which anticipated a\r\nvery rapid increase of population.”\r\n\r\n(I could quote Woodrow Wilson to the same effect, only Woodrow isn’t\r\nworth while.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow it must occur to Mr. Adams that these facts are at war with his\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nVirginia, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, the two Carolinas and Georgia\r\nwould never have been found opposing the equality of representation of\r\nthe states in the Senate if the purpose of that senatorial equality was\r\nthe perpetuation of the institution of slavery.\r\n\r\nThere _was_ a compromise which the slave-owners wrung as a concession\r\nfrom the free states, but this compromise benefited them _in the lower\r\nHouse, not in the Senate_.\r\n\r\nWhen the Constitution gave the slave states representation based upon\r\n_three-fifths of the slaves_, the institution of slavery derived strength\r\nfrom the _national idea_ of Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and Virginia—_not\r\nfrom the State Rights idea_ of New Jersey, Delaware and Connecticut.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          “_Take the Children_”\r\n\r\nIn France the Privileged Classes had created a situation which pleased\r\nthem perfectly.\r\n\r\nA fifth of the soil belonged to 30,000 noble families; another fifth\r\nbelonged to the clergy; another fifth belonged to the king and city\r\ngovernments; the remaining two-fifths belonged to all the other people,\r\nmiddle class and peasants.\r\n\r\nTo the support of the Government the clergy contributed nothing except as\r\na free gift; the nobility contributed pretty much what they pleased, and\r\nthey did not please to contribute a great deal.\r\n\r\nThe king’s family spent $55,000,000 per year. Two brothers of the king\r\nspent $2,000,000; and, to pay the debts of one princely bankrupt, King\r\nLouis XVI took $3,000,000 out of the public funds.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred and ninety-five cooks served in the king’s kitchen. Nearly\r\ntwo thousand horses stood in his stables. A squad of soldiers escorted\r\nhis dinner to the table. A magnificent band furnished music while he\r\nate, and a dozen gallant lords, paid for the service, helped him to\r\nundress and get to bed when the arduous do-nothing of the day had been\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\nSome 30,000,000 Frenchmen did not enter into this world of privilege.\r\nThe merchant, the lawyer, the doctor, the manufacturer, the farmer, the\r\nlaborer—all these stood outside the pearly gates, catching only a glimpse\r\nof the radiance within, hearing only, as from a distance, the music of\r\nthis Eden, created by class legislation.\r\n\r\nThe peasant neither owned his land absolutely nor _himself_ absolutely.\r\nOver him and his was suspended the heavy sword of class privilege.\r\n\r\nThe noble hunter of game, who enjoyed the exclusive privilege of killing\r\ngame, might trample down his grain with the utmost unconcern, at whatever\r\ntime the pleasure of the noble huntsman dictated. Mr. Peasant was not\r\nallowed to protect his fields and crops by putting up any kind of\r\ninclosure.\r\n\r\nMr. Peasant must not kill the wild boar or the antlered stag, even though\r\nthose noble beasts, reserved for noble huntsmen, were destroying the crop\r\nupon which he and his family were dependent for a living.\r\n\r\nHe could not, under any conditions whatsoever, destroy the pigeons which\r\ncame sweeping down upon his grain, nor must he, during certain seasons,\r\nmanure his crop or hoe out the grass, lest he injure the flavor of the\r\nyoung partridges, and deprive them of the shelter necessary for their\r\ncomfort and growth.\r\n\r\nHe could not press his grapes save at the nobleman’s wine-press, nor\r\ngrind his wheat save at the nobleman’s mill, nor bake his bread elsewhere\r\nthan in the nobleman’s oven.\r\n\r\nThese monopolies were peculiar to the lord, and the peasant must pay toll\r\nlest the lord’s revenues decrease.\r\n\r\nThe peasant could not vote, had really no civic existence, was not\r\nconsidered in the government of the country; could be made to work\r\nwhether he wished to do so or not for the noble and the king. His horses\r\ncould be taken from the cart, or from the plow, if his superiors\r\ndemanded it. Neither for his labor nor his horse was he paid. He could\r\nnot put salt into his victuals without paying a high price for it, and he\r\nwas not allowed to eat his victuals unsalted. The law _compelled_ him to\r\nbuy a certain portion of salt every year at an exorbitant price.\r\n\r\nThe church took from him one-tenth of all he made, besides which he must\r\npay fees for christenings, marriages, burials and pardons for sins—to say\r\nnothing of prayers in behalf of the living, the dying and the dead. The\r\nfeudal lord took from him annually a certain part of all he made.\r\n\r\nThe French historian Taine says that in some portions of France the\r\npeasant paid in feudal dues, church tithes and royal taxes _more than\r\nthree-fourths of all that he made_. In other portions of France _the\r\nentire net produce of the soil went to the church and state_, and so\r\ngreat was the intolerable burden that _the peasants quit in despair, left\r\nthe land to become a desert waste, and flocked to the cities to swell the\r\narmy of The Wretched_.\r\n\r\nTo throw off the shackles of this frightful system of misgovernment the\r\nFrench Revolutionist roused the people.\r\n\r\nAt first Great Britain rejoiced in the movement which Lafayette,\r\nMirabeau, Necker, Sieyès and Camille Desmoulins inaugurated. These\r\nearly revolutionists declared their purpose to set up a constitutional\r\ngovernment in France such as Great Britain enjoyed, but when these\r\nmoderate and constitutional reformers were thrown aside by the radical\r\ndemocrats who were determined to establish a republic—when this democracy\r\nhad confiscated the lands held by the church, had issued paper money\r\nand had taken for national uses the abandoned estates of the immigrant\r\nnobles, the ruling powers of church and state in Great Britain became\r\ngreatly alarmed, and it was resolved that war to the death should be\r\nwaged against the principles of the French Revolution.\r\n\r\nUnless this were done, democracy might assert itself in Great Britain,\r\nand those things which had been taken from the people under forms of\r\nlaw might be restored in the same way to the original owners. Therefore\r\nWilliam Pitt, Prime Minister and actual ruler of Great Britain, declared\r\nwar upon France, blockaded her coasts, organized European kings into\r\nconfederacies against her, and for more than a dozen dreadful years\r\npoured armed legions upon her.\r\n\r\nDuring this era of “blood and iron” men were torn from peaceful pursuits\r\nthroughout Great Britain to supply the navy and the army with food for\r\npowder.\r\n\r\nAs a necessary consequence, the demand for labor was greater than the\r\nsupply; and as England depends especially upon her manufactures, it was\r\nthere that the scarcity of labor was most injuriously felt.\r\n\r\nIt is said that a deputation representing the manufacturers waited upon\r\nthe Prime Minister and laid their grievances before him, asking the\r\nquestion, “_What must we do?_”\r\n\r\nMr. Pitt is reported to have answered, “TAKE THE CHILDREN.”\r\n\r\nThis story may not be true, but it is a fact that it represented\r\nprecisely the emergency, and the manner in which that emergency was met.\r\nIt also represents correctly the attitude of Mr. Pitt as defined in his\r\nspeeches in Parliament.\r\n\r\nA cruel, unjustifiable war had devoured the laborer who should have been\r\nat his task. The laws had dragged him into the army and into the navy\r\nwhether he wished to go or not. Press-gangs had prowled about the lanes\r\nand alleys clutching at every poor man who happened to be sound of limb,\r\nand had carried him off by force into a battleship, where he might be\r\nkept until the bride whom he had left at the church door had counted him\r\nas dead, or until the family which he had left contented and happy had\r\nbeen lost to the knowledge of men.\r\n\r\n_Having taken the father, the same remorseless class-greed demanded the\r\nchild, and took it._\r\n\r\nUpon the altar of English lust for money has been sacrificed more\r\nhelpless men, women and children than ever fell before the ruthless\r\nhordes of Tamerlane or Attila.\r\n\r\n“Within carefully guarded limits, child-labor is no more to be objected\r\nto in manufactures than in agriculture, but in the early days of the\r\nfactory system these limits were utterly discarded.\r\n\r\n“In the infancy of the system it became the custom of the master\r\nmanufacturers to contract with the managers of workhouses throughout\r\nEngland and of the charities of Scotland, to send their young children\r\nto the factories of the great towns. _Many thousands of children between\r\nthe ages of six and ten_ were thus sent, absolutely uncared for and\r\nunprotected, and left to the complete disposal of masters who often had\r\nnot a single thought except speedily to amass a fortune, and _who knew\r\nthat if the first supply of infant labor were used up there was still\r\nmuch more to be obtained_.\r\n\r\n“Thousands of children at this early age might be found working in the\r\nfactories of England and Scotland, usually from twelve to fourteen,\r\nsometimes even fifteen and sixteen hours a day, not unfrequently during\r\nthe greater part of the night. _Destitute or drunken or unnatural parents\r\nmade it a regular system to raise money by hiring out their children from\r\nsix, sometimes from five, years old, by written contracts and for long\r\nperiods. In one case brought before Parliament a gang of these children\r\nwas put up for sale among a bankrupt’s effects, and publicly advertised\r\nas part of the property._ In another an agreement was disclosed between\r\na London parish and a Lancashire manufacturer in which it was stipulated\r\nthat _with every twenty sound children one idiot should be taken_.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Even as late as 1840, when the most important manufactures had been\r\nregulated by law, Lord Ashley was able to show that _boys employed in the\r\ncarpet manufacture at Kidderminster were called up at three and four in\r\nthe morning, and kept working sixteen or eighteen hours_: that children\r\nfive years old were engaged in the unhealthy trade of pin-making, and\r\nwere kept at work from six in the morning to eight at night.” (Lecky,\r\n“England in Eighteenth Century.”)\r\n\r\nIn the coal mines and in the salt mines men, women and children were\r\nliterally beasts of burden—were chattels, and when the mines were\r\nsold the human machines passed from one owner to another just as the\r\nmechanical apparatus passed.\r\n\r\nThere were women who in these coal mines, where the tunnels were too\r\nnarrow to allow them to stand upright, had to crawl back and forward on\r\ntheir hands and knees for fourteen to sixteen hours a day, drawing after\r\nthem the trucks loaded with coal.\r\n\r\n_These trucks were securely fastened to the woman by means of a chain\r\nwhich passed between her legs and was attached to a belt strapped round\r\nher waist. The woman seldom wore any clothes except an old pair of\r\ntrousers made of sacking._\r\n\r\n“Little children were forced to work underground from year to year.\r\nDeep in the gloom of a night which had neither moonlight nor stars;\r\nrarely ever seeing the face of nature and of day—lost to God’s glory of\r\nsunlight, shady woods, silvery waters—lost to intelligence, happiness,\r\nenjoyment, reduced to the helpless condition of beasts of burden.”\r\n\r\nWhat was true of the mines was also true of the factories.\r\n\r\nMen, women and children were forced to work for a number of hours\r\nabsolutely inconsistent with physical and moral development.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1833 Lord Ashley led in the noble effort to redeem the\r\nchildren from the clutches of unscrupulous commercialism, and to lighten\r\nthe burden of men and women by regulating the hours of labor and the\r\nconditions of service.\r\n\r\nAfter a most stubborn resistance, in which the corporations urged\r\nagainst the reform every reason which we hear urged in our day, England\r\ndid herself the immense credit of checking the tyranny of those who were\r\ngrinding the lives out of the poor in order that the rich should become\r\nricher.\r\n\r\nIn this country the cry of commercialism is the same as that which in\r\nGreat Britain said, “_Take the children_.”\r\n\r\nCorporations want cheap labor. If they can’t get the adult, they take the\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nIn the Southern states the tendency to employ children has had alarming\r\ndevelopment. In 1880 the total number of cotton factory employees was\r\n16,740. Of these, 4,090 were children under sixteen years of age. In\r\nthe year 1900 the total number of employees had increased to 97,559. Of\r\nthese, 24,459 _were children under sixteen years of age_.\r\n\r\nIn the states outside of the South there were, in 1880, 155,803 employees\r\nin cotton factories. Of this number, 24,243 were children under sixteen\r\nyears of age. In the year 1900 the total number of cotton factory\r\nemployees in states outside of the South was 205,302. Of these, only\r\n15,796 were children under sixteen years of age.\r\n\r\nIn other words, within the Southern states the children under sixteen\r\nyears of age constitute now, as they did twenty years ago, _25 per cent.\r\nof all the operatives employed_: whereas, _in the states outside the\r\nSouth the children under sixteen number less than 8 per cent. of all\r\nthose employed_. Therefore the situation which was justly considered so\r\nbad in Great Britain that it was reformed seventy years ago, and which\r\nhas been reformed in most of the states outside of the South, is three\r\ntimes worse in the South than it is in any other portion of the Union,\r\n_and is just as bad now as it was twenty years ago_.\r\n\r\nIn _The Tradesman_, of Chattanooga, Tenn., August 15, 1902, the statement\r\nis made that the number of children under sixteen years of age now at\r\nwork in the Southern mills approximated 50,000.\r\n\r\nThe 50,000 little ones who troop to the mill every morning, breathe the\r\nsteam-heated, dust-laden, germ-infected atmosphere of the close rooms\r\nthroughout the entire day, who light, with lanterns, their way home\r\nacross the fields when darkness has fallen, are white children. During\r\nthe same hours that these white boys and girls are finding their way to\r\nthe factory where their energy and strength is offered up as a sacrifice\r\nto mammon, 50,000 black children are singing merrily on their way to\r\nschool, _where they are gaining what the white children are losing_.\r\n\r\nGlance forward twenty years and ask yourselves what will be the relative\r\npositions of the 50,000 white children and the 50,000 black children. _It\r\nwill be a miracle if most of those white children are not either in their\r\ngraves, or in the hospitals, or in the slums, or in the prisons, while\r\nthe 50,000 black children will be holding clerkships in some department\r\nof the Federal Government._\r\n\r\nThe kind of civilization which we are going to have in the future\r\nis being determined now. Race development and progress cannot be\r\nextemporized or bought ready-made. It is a matter of preparing the soil,\r\nplanting the seed, cultivating the crop.\r\n\r\nWe shall reap as we shall have sown.\r\n\r\nThe most profoundly disgusting feature of the Southern political\r\nsituation today is that _the Democratic bosses who control our state\r\nlegislatures will not allow us to give our white children as good\r\ntreatment as the negro children are getting_.\r\n\r\nAlmost universally the Southern mills are controlled by Northern\r\ncapitalists; but it is the Southern politician, officeholder, editor or\r\nstockholder who rushes to the legislature saying that _child slavery must\r\ncontinue because it is good for the child_.\r\n\r\nThese Northern capitalists who own Southern mills are, to a large extent,\r\nRepublicans in politics. The unprincipled Southern men who put up a plea\r\nin behalf of child slavery are almost exclusively Democratic.\r\n\r\nJust as J. P. Morgan, the Republican railroad king, uses the Southern\r\nDemocratic machine to rob the people through his railroads, so the\r\nNorthern Republican millowner uses the Southern Democratic politician to\r\nrivet upon the Southern white child the chains of commercial serfdom,\r\n_ruinous to the child and ominous to the future of the white race in the\r\nSouth_.\r\n\r\nIt was class-greed which first raised the cry, “_Take the children_.” It\r\nis class-greed which _now_ says, “TAKE THE CHILDREN.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _Paternalism_\r\n\r\nOne of the dreadfulest words that ever scared a mossback is “Paternalism.”\r\n\r\nHe does not know what it means, and he does not want to know. He flees\r\nfrom it as from something too blood-curdling to look upon. His leaders,\r\nhis orators, his editors, have all told him that no language could fully\r\ndescribe the horrors of “Paternalism”; and therefore he feels that while\r\npoverty, slavery, hunger and starvation are sometimes annoying incidents\r\nin life, they bear no comparison to the pitiless rigors of “Paternalism.”\r\n\r\nHe has got used to unmerciful taxes, to ill-paid labor, to squalid\r\nsurroundings, to empty pockets, and to the cry of children hungering\r\nfor bread. All these discomforts he can stand, because they have come\r\nto him in the natural course of events under the rule of Democracy\r\nand Republicanism. But the very idea of a new party springing up and\r\npracticing “Paternalism” unnerves him. He fears he couldn’t stand it.\r\n\r\nWe had this terror-stricken victim of Democratic bugabooism in mind today\r\nwhen we read the decision of Cleveland’s Attorney-General, to the effect\r\nthat whisky in a bonded warehouse could not be reached by process from a\r\nState Court.\r\n\r\nUnder a law which has stealthily slipped upon the statute-book while the\r\npeople were not noticing, the producers of distilled liquors get the\r\nprivilege of storing their “firewater” in a government warehouse and\r\ngetting a certificate of deposit.\r\n\r\nThe Government takes care of the whisky until the owner feels like paying\r\na tax upon it.\r\n\r\nFormerly, under an act passed by Republicans and Democrats, this\r\nexemption from tax lasted three years. At the last session of Congress\r\nthe Democrats, out of tender consideration for the poor, downtrodden\r\nWhisky Trust, extended this exemption to eight years.\r\n\r\nThe great and good Government of the United States, therefore, steps\r\nforward through its officers, and kindly says to the distiller: “Hand me\r\nyour whisky bottle: I’ll take care of it for you until you get ready to\r\npay your taxes.”\r\n\r\nNot only does our great and good Government say substantially these very\r\nwords to the distiller, but it guards his whisky bottle so jealously\r\nthat no writ or execution or other process from a State Court is allowed\r\nto touch the liquor which is thus being held by the Government for the\r\nbenefit of the owner.\r\n\r\nGovernor Tillman, of South Carolina, tried to bring his power as Chief\r\nMagistrate of a sovereign state to bear on some of the whisky which Uncle\r\nSam was taking care of for the Whisky Trust, but the voice of our great\r\nand good Government was promptly heard saying, “Keep off the Grass.”\r\n\r\nBrave Benjamin had to let the whisky alone.\r\n\r\nThe certificate of deposit issued on the liquor by the Government to the\r\ndistiller becomes at once valuable commercial paper upon which he can get\r\nany amount of money he wants.\r\n\r\nHe can go to New York, borrow money on his certificate at 2 per cent.,\r\nand use it for eight years without difficulty, because the money-lenders\r\nhave the certificate which shows to them that the Government is taking\r\ngood care of the whisky all the time.\r\n\r\nIs this “Paternalism”?\r\n\r\nIf so, please don’t mention it to the mossback whom we have described.\r\nIt might make him run away and tear the buggy up.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _Planting Corn_\r\n\r\nThe bluebird was out today; out in his glossiest plumage, his throat\r\ngurgling with song.\r\n\r\nFor the sunlight was warm and radiant in all the South, and the coming\r\nspring had laid its benediction on every field and hedge and forest.\r\n\r\nThe smell of newly plowed ground mingled with the subtle incense of the\r\nyellow jasmine; and from every orchard a shower of the blossoms of peach\r\nand apple and pear was wafted into the yard and hung lovingly on the\r\neaves and in the piazzas of the old homestead—the old and faded homestead.\r\n\r\nWas there a cloud in all the sky? Not one, not one.\r\n\r\n“Gee! Mule!!!”\r\n\r\n“Dad blast your hide, why don’t you gee-e-EE!!”\r\n\r\nCo-whack! goes the plowline on the back of the patient mule—the dignified\r\nupholder of mortgages, “time price” accounts, and the family credit\r\ngenerally.\r\n\r\nDown the furrow, and up the furrow; down to the woods, and up to the\r\nfence—there they go, the sturdy plowman and his much-enduring but\r\nindispensable mule.\r\n\r\nFor the poplar leaves are now as big as squirrel-ears and it’s “time to\r\nplant corn.”\r\n\r\nOn moves the plowman, steady as a clock, silent and reflective.\r\n\r\nRight after him comes the corndropper, dropping corn.\r\n\r\nThe grains faintly chink as the bare feet of the corndropper hurry past;\r\nand before the corn has well cuddled itself into the shoe-heel of the\r\nplowman’s track, down comes the hoe of the “coverer”—and then the seeds\r\npass into the portals of the great unknown; the unknown of burial, of\r\ndeath and of life renewed.\r\n\r\nPeeping from the thicket, near at hand, the royal redbird makes note\r\nof what is going on, nor is the thrush blind to the progress of the\r\ncorndropper. And seated with calm but watchful dignity on the highest\r\npine in the thicket sits the melancholy crow, sharpening his appetite\r\nwith all the anticipated pleasures of simple larceny.\r\n\r\nThe mocking-bird circles and swoops from tree to tree, and in her\r\nmatchless bursts of varied song no cadence is wanting, no melody missed.\r\n\r\nThe hum of the bees is in the air; white butterflies, like snowflakes,\r\nfall down the light and lazily float away.\r\n\r\nThe robin lingers about the China tree, and the bluejay, lifting his\r\nplumed frontlet, picks a quarrel with every feathered acquaintance and\r\nnoisily asserts his grievances.\r\n\r\nThe jo-ree has dived deeper into the thicket, and the festive sapsucker,\r\nhe of the scarlet crest, begins to come to the front, inquisitive as to\r\nthe location of bugs and worms.\r\n\r\nOn such a day, such a cloudless, radiant, flower-sweetened day, the\r\nhorseman slackens the rein as he rides through lanes and quiet fields;\r\nand he dares to dream that the children of God once loved each other.\r\n\r\nOn such a day one may dream that the time might come when they would do\r\nso again.\r\n\r\nRein in and stop, here on this high hill! Look north, look east where\r\nthe sun rises, look south, look west where the sun sets—on all sides the\r\nscene is the same. In every field the steady mule, the steady plowman and\r\nthe children dropping corn.\r\n\r\nClose the eye a moment and look at the picture fancy paints. Every field\r\nin Georgia is there, every field in the South is there. And in each\r\nthe figures are the same—the steady mule and the steady man, and the\r\npattering feet of the children dropping corn.\r\n\r\nIn these furrows lie the food of the republic; on these fields depend\r\nlife, and health and happiness.\r\n\r\nHalt those children—and see how the cheek of the world would blanch at\r\nthought of famine!\r\n\r\nParalyze that plowman—and see how national bankruptcy would shatter every\r\ncity in the Union.\r\n\r\nDropping corn! A simple thing, you say.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, as those white seeds rattle down to the sod and hide away for a\r\nseason, it needs no peculiar strength of fancy to see a Jacob’s ladder\r\ncrowded with ascending blessings.\r\n\r\nScornfully the railroad king would glance at these small teams in each\r\nsmall field; yet check those corndroppers and his cars would rot on the\r\nroad and rust would devour the engines in the roundhouse. The banker\r\nwould ride through those fields thinking only of his hoarded millions,\r\nnor would he ever startle himself with the thought that his millions\r\nwould melt away in mist were those tiny hands never more to be found\r\ndropping corn. The bondholder, proud in all the security of the untaxed\r\nreceiver of other people’s taxes, would see in these fields merely the\r\nindustry from which he gathers tribute; it would never dawn on his mind\r\nthat without the opening of those furrows and the hurrying army of\r\nchildren dropping corn his bond wouldn’t be worth the paper it is written\r\non.\r\n\r\nYet it is literally so.\r\n\r\nFeed the world, and it can live, work, produce and march on. Starve it,\r\nand what becomes of railroads, banks, mills, mines, notes, mortgages and\r\nbonds?\r\n\r\nGreat is the might of this republic!—great in its schools, churches,\r\ncourts, legislatures; great in its towns and cities; great in its\r\ncommerce, great in its manufactures, great in its colossal wealth.\r\n\r\nBut sweep from under it all these worn and wasted fields, strike into\r\nidleness or death the plowman, his wife and his child, and what becomes\r\nof the gorgeous structure whose foundation is his field?\r\n\r\nHalt the food growers, and what becomes of your gold and its “intrinsic\r\nvalue”?\r\n\r\nHow much of your gold can you eat?\r\n\r\nHow many of your diamonds will answer the need of a loaf?\r\n\r\nBut enough.\r\n\r\nIt is time to ride down the hill. The tinkle of the cow-bell follows the\r\nsinking sun—both on the way home.\r\n\r\nSo with many an unspoken thought I ride homeward, thinking of those who\r\nplant the corn.\r\n\r\nAnd hard indeed would be the heart that, knowing what these people do and\r\nbear and suffer, yet would not fashion this prayer to the favored of the\r\nrepublic: “O rulers, lawmakers, soldiers, judges, bankers, merchants,\r\neditors, lawyers, doctors, preachers, bondholders! _Be not so unmindful\r\nof the toil and misery of those who feed you!_”\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Not Parson Brownlow’s Son_\r\n\r\n                                        KNOXVILLE, TENN., April 26, 1905.\r\n\r\n      _Hon.

Brownlow, to\r\n      whom you refer, being a son of the “famous Parson.” Parson\r\n      Brownlow has only one son living, Colonel John Bell Brownlow,\r\n      who commanded the regiment in which I was an officer, the\r\n      Ninth Tennessee Cavalry Volunteers of the Union troops during\r\n      the Civil War, and who lives in this city and is not a member\r\n      of Congress now nor has he ever been.\r\n\r\n        Please publish this in full in your issue for June and\r\n      greatly oblige me.\r\n\r\n                              Respectfully,\r\n\r\n                                                      W.

Many of the truths which you utter\r\n      through the medium of your great magazine will prove to\r\n      be precious seed sown in the rich soil of the national\r\n      conscience, and the fruitage will be invaluable.—W.

We are glad it was done. The people\r\ncan now navigate the Monongahela as freely as Carnegie can do it; but is\r\nit not mortifying to reflect _that the PEOPLE were powerless against the\r\nwrong until the coal and iron kings took the case in hand_?\r\n\r\nAnd isn’t it amazing to see how easily the doors of the Treasury fly\r\nopen, and the millions pour out, when the Privileged Corporations want it\r\ndone?\r\n\r\nWhen it became a matter of self-interest to the Privileged Corporations\r\nto buy out the Monongahela monopoly the Constitution was not in the way\r\nnor was the money lacking.\r\n\r\nWhenever it suits the same Privileged Classes to unload the Railroads on\r\nto the Government at fancy prices it will be done. When that day comes\r\nthe Constitution will not be in the way nor will the means be lacking.\r\n\r\nWhenever the Privileged Classes want ANYTHING done the Constitution\r\napproves and the cash box is full.\r\n\r\nIt is only when the masses want anything done that our Constitution\r\nbecomes a fretful porcupine with quills erect and our cash box has a\r\nhollow sound.\r\n\r\nIf you want to have a jolly time with that gay old creature, the United\r\nStates Constitution, join the Privileged Corporations.\r\n\r\nIf you want to frolic with the United States Treasury and pay for what\r\nyou want with public money, join the Privileged Corporations.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _Rural Free Delivery to Country People_\r\n\r\n        (Extract from the _People’s Party Paper_, March, 1893, Mr.\r\n      Watson’s paper, commenting upon the passage of the _first\r\n      appropriation_ for the R. F. D.)\r\n\r\nThe annual appropriations for the free delivery of mails was, until the\r\npresent administration, confined to cities of over 10,000 inhabitants. At\r\nthe suggestion of Mr. Wanamaker, an experiment was made in smaller towns\r\nenjoying daily mails, but as yet no country neighborhoods had obtained\r\nthe privilege.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, February 17, 1893, when the annual appropriation was pending,\r\nMr. Watson proposed an amendment as follows:\r\n\r\n        For free delivery service, including existing experimental\r\n      free delivery offices, $11,254,900, of which the sum of\r\n      $10,000 shall be applied, under the direction of the\r\n      Postmaster-General, to experimental free delivery in rural\r\n      communities other than towns and villages.\r\n\r\nMr. Watson urged that the paragraph proposed to be amended “provides\r\nfor the expenditure of $11,254,943 for free delivery service. The\r\namendment reduced the amount of that expenditure and simply directed\r\nthat the Postmaster-General should apply $10,000 of the appropriation\r\nto experimental free delivery in rural communities.” The following\r\ndiscussion followed:\r\n\r\n_Mr. Watson_—“Mr. Chairman, the present law provides for an experimental\r\nfree delivery in rural communities; but as I understand it—and the\r\nchairman of the committee, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.\r\nHenderson), makes the same statement to the House—_the law has been\r\nconstrued to mean cities, towns and villages_, and there are now in\r\noperation experimental free deliveries in certain towns and villages.\r\n\r\n“The law expressly provides for ‘rural communities,’ and it seems to me\r\nwhere the general laws make such provision there is no hardship in taking\r\na small amount from this appropriation, only $10,000, and appropriating\r\nit for _experimental free delivery in absolutely rural communities_, that\r\nis to say, _in the country pure and simple, among the farmers, in those\r\nneighborhoods where they do not get their mail more than once in every\r\ntwo weeks, and where these deserving people have settled in communities\r\none hundred years old and do not receive a newspaper that is not two\r\nweeks behind the times_.\r\n\r\n“The amendment proposes not to increase the appropriation; it actually\r\ndiminishes it by a nominal amount, but takes $10,000 of it to be provided\r\nfor _experimental free delivery in absolutely rural communities, instead\r\nof towns and villages, which the authorities construe to mean ‘rural\r\ncommunities.’_ In other words, I think that part of the money ought to\r\nbe spent _in the country_, where the law provides it shall be spent, and\r\nhaving made this statement, if we can have another division, and the\r\ncommittee is against my amendment, I will yield to its will.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Henderson, of North Carolina_—“Mr. Chairman, the only law on the\r\nsubject at all is in the very language used in this appropriation bill:\r\n\r\n“‘For free delivery service, including existing experimental free\r\ndelivery offices.’\r\n\r\n“That is all the law now on the statute-books in regard to this question.\r\n\r\n“_I do not want the statement of the gentleman from Georgia in regard to\r\nthere being a law on the statutes as to rural free delivery to go without\r\ncorrection._”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Watson_—“Mr. Chairman, _this delivery in the small towns and\r\nvillages is called ‘rural free delivery.’_”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Henderson, of North Carolina_—“But as a matter of fact _there is no\r\nlaw_ except that stated here in this appropriation bill.”\r\n\r\nThe amendment was adopted by the House. This opens up the way for the\r\nfarmers to secure services on an equal footing with the residents of\r\nthe towns and the cities. It is one of the first instances in which the\r\nGovernment has put itself in daily touch with the citizen of the rural\r\ncommunity. If followed up by successive Congresses, this entering wedge\r\nmay cleave the way for a system of intercommunication that will remove a\r\ngreat inconvenience and cause for dissatisfaction in country homes. As a\r\nfirst step its importance cannot be overestimated.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Random Paragraphs_\r\n\r\nYou may say what you please about Castro, but I glory in his spunk.\r\n\r\nPresident of Venezuela, he was sitting comfortably in his seat when, one\r\nday, another Venezuelan who wanted the job cooked up an Insurrection.\r\n\r\nSouth American revolutions, like all other procedures in civilized\r\ncommunities, have to be financed.\r\n\r\nThe question with the leader of the Venezuelan insurrection was:\r\n\r\n“Who will finance _me_?”\r\n\r\nThe Asphalt Trust stepped forward with necessary funds.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the Trust was assured by Matos, the Insurgent leader, that in\r\nthe event his revolution succeeded the Trust was to have dominion over\r\nVenezuela, like unto that which Standard Oil has over our own Eden of\r\nChristian Civilization.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, the Trust put up its money on Matos, who turned out to be\r\nthe wrong horse.\r\n\r\nCastro won. But the Trust continued to help Matos even after he had lost.\r\nDied hard, you see, because death is not the law of Nature with Trusts.\r\nUsually they live and the other fellow dies.\r\n\r\nThe Asphalt Trust is composed, in part, of American experts in Frenzied\r\nFinance. These marauders who were seeking new worlds to conquer planned\r\nto catch Venezuela in the same net which holds _us_.\r\n\r\nCastro defied them, fought them in the Courts, whipped them, took away\r\nthe franchise for non-performance of contract, etc.\r\n\r\nThen they had the brazen audacity to demand that our Government coerce\r\nCastro.\r\n\r\nThe Trusts rule the United States—shall little Venezuela check their\r\ncareer of conquest?\r\n\r\nAway with the feeble Castro!\r\n\r\nSaid the Trust to Roosevelt:\r\n\r\n“Shake your big stick at this South American crank and make him\r\n_Arbitrate_!”\r\n\r\nSays Roosevelt to Castro:\r\n\r\n“Arbitrate with the Asphalt Trust, or——”\r\n\r\nSays Castro to Roosevelt:\r\n\r\n“Arbitrate nothing! Hands off, or——”\r\n\r\nIn other words, our Government, friendly always to Frenzied Finance, put\r\nup a bluff on Castro.\r\n\r\nWhereupon Castro stood pat and “called” Roosevelt.\r\n\r\nAnd, all at once, Mr. Roosevelt went a-hunting, and left Taft—the portly,\r\nhandsome, self-complacent Taft—“sitting on the lid.”\r\n\r\nBully for you, Castro!\r\n\r\nEvidently you are “some punkins.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWould to heaven we had a Castro to smash the Beef Trust!\r\n\r\nRoosevelt and young Garfield don’t seem to know where to take hold.

At first he advocated state ownership, which\r\nwould have given us forty-odd different systems. Now he has reached the\r\npoint where he wants the Nation to own national lines of transportation\r\nwhile the states are to own “local lines.” _Wouldn’t_ we have a sweet\r\ntime deciding which roads are national and which are local?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUnder the present system every line of transportation has a double\r\ncharacter, partly national and partly local, and _the traffic_ on every\r\nline is partly state and partly inter-state.\r\n\r\nYou can no more separate what is national from what is local in the\r\nrailroads than you can in the Post-Office.\r\n\r\n_Every_ postal route is at once local and national. A letter may come\r\nfive miles, five hundred or five thousand—the _system_ carries it to its\r\ndestination.\r\n\r\nSo with freight and passengers. The so-called local railroad will carry\r\nfreight from the adjoining county, from the adjoining state, from the\r\nremotest section of the Union, and from the lands beyond our borders. So\r\nwith passengers.\r\n\r\nWhy, then, should anybody be talking tommyrot about “_local lines_”?\r\n\r\nSaid Betsy Prig to Sairey Gamp, concerning the alleged existence of a\r\ncertain Mrs. Harris, “_I don’t believe there is no sich a person._”\r\n\r\nSays I to W.

But if he would use his\r\nthinking apparatus a little more, and his organs of speech a little less,\r\nhe would get on faster.\r\n\r\n“Local lines” of transportation—_at this time_?\r\n\r\nHe might as well say that the artery in his left hind leg is a “local\r\nartery.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe New York _World_ says:\r\n\r\n“If Judge Parker is a Democrat, Mr. Bryan is not.

Nature did not produce it; it has\r\nno life, no motion other than that which we lunatics give it.\r\n\r\nOne day it occurred to John Sherman to stack up, in the Treasury, a cool\r\nhundred million dollars, and keep it there, idle.\r\n\r\nHe straightway created the _Gold Reserve_.\r\n\r\nAny law for this? No.\r\n\r\nAny necessity for it? No.\r\n\r\nAny popular demand for it? No.\r\n\r\nHis excuse was that he wanted a Gold Reserve out of which to pay off the\r\n$346,000,000 in Greenbacks “when presented for redemption.”\r\n\r\nWas anybody clamoring for the redemption of Greenbacks? No.\r\n\r\nWas there any law under which anybody had a right to go to the Treasury\r\nand demand gold for Greenbacks? No.\r\n\r\nWas there any custom or policy which authorized this setting apart of\r\ngold to redeem Greenbacks? No.\r\n\r\nBut Sherman did it, just the same, and it soon appeared that he had made\r\nus a Mumbo Jumbo which we all worshiped and before whose mysterious power\r\nwe all fell prostrate.\r\n\r\nAs long as Sherman was Secretary of the Treasury the Gold Reserve was\r\nsacred. Congress looked upon it with awe. The President did it reverence.\r\nThe newspapers bent to it in speechless adoration. The politicians rubbed\r\nthe skin off their stomachs groveling before it. The people—the great\r\ninert mass within which is irresistible might if they but had courage and\r\nco-operation—patiently padded their knees and, likewise, knelt in mute\r\nsubmission.\r\n\r\nThe Gold Reserve was a national institution—like the Washington\r\nMonument—not to be desecrated, but recognized, supported, defended.\r\n\r\nSenators alluded to it as they would to Plymouth Rock or Mount Vernon. It\r\nwas a fixed fact which nobody disputed and all respected.\r\n\r\nStatutes referred to it, in passing, as they did to West Point or\r\nYellowstone Park—something that was permanent, national, inseparable from\r\nthe life of the Republic.\r\n\r\nThere never was a law for the Gold Reserve, there never was a necessity\r\nfor it, there never was an antecedent discussion in regard to it,\r\nand there never was a particle of financial sense in it. Nobody ever\r\npresented Greenbacks for redemption until Mr. Carlisle made his infamous\r\nruling, and gold was paid out for paper and bonds issued to get the gold\r\nback.\r\n\r\nThe Gold Reserve was useless until it became, under Carlisle’s ruling, a\r\nbait to set the bond trap with.\r\n\r\nTo show that it has no influence upon the value of Greenbacks we need\r\nonly to point to the fact that although the size of the Gold Reserve\r\nconstantly fluctuated for about a year after Carlisle’s ruling, the value\r\nof the Greenbacks has not varied at all.\r\n\r\nIf the Greenbacks depended on the Gold Reserve, their value would have\r\nrisen and fallen with the Gold Reserve.\r\n\r\nThe Greenbacks do not, and never did, depend on the Gold Reserve.\r\nThey depend on the credit of the Government, and the known fact that\r\nthe credit of the Government is based on $80,000,000,000 of national\r\nwealth. Their legal tender quality, their usefulness as money, their\r\nreceivability for taxes and public dues, make them good in the eyes of\r\nthe people irrespective of any Gold Reserve.\r\n\r\nJohn Sherman had no more right to make a Gold Reserve than he had to make\r\na Silver Reserve.\r\n\r\nGreenbacks were no more redeemable in gold than they were in silver.\r\nBut why argue the case? The verdict is already made up in the minds\r\nof the jury. Both the old parties pay their vows to the Gold Reserve.\r\nMumbo Jumbo is shrined in the hearts of both Democrats and Republicans.\r\nSherman’s god rules.\r\n\r\nWe quake every time they tell us that anything bad has happened to the\r\nGold Reserve. We used to toss in our sleep, muttering distressfully, when\r\nthe news would come that the Gold Reserve “is dwindling.”\r\n\r\nWhat good does Mumbo Jumbo do the naked African? None.\r\n\r\nBut then, you see, the African doesn’t know it. Therein he is a fool.\r\n\r\nWhat good does _our_ Mumbo Jumbo, the Gold Reserve, do _us_? None.\r\n\r\nBut then, you see, we do not know it.\r\n\r\nWherein _we are bigger fools than the African is_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                _Poverty_\r\n\r\n                        BY JOHN H. GIRDNER, M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have just read Mr. Robert Hunter’s book entitled “Poverty.” It\r\ncontains much valuable information, mostly in the form of statistics and\r\nreferences to other publications concerning the poor in different parts\r\nof the United States and England. It is a good book of reference; but\r\nto my mind its principal virtue is as a thought provoker. The question,\r\n“What are you going to do about poverty?” stares the reader in the face\r\nfrom between the lines on every page, and it haunts him after he has laid\r\nthe book aside.\r\n\r\nWe of the United States are accustomed to boast of our material wealth\r\nand prosperity. When the writer or the orator wishes to wring the hearts\r\nof his audience and deceive them into the belief that ours, as conducted\r\nat present, is the very best of all governments, he draws a harrowing\r\npicture of the dreadful suffering of the poor of London; and then we pull\r\nthe Stars and Stripes a little more closely about us, and, as that other\r\nPharisee, we thank God that we are not like other men. Before we shed any\r\nmore tears over the poor of London let us see if we cannot find use for\r\nour tears nearer home.\r\n\r\nMr. Charles Booth made a thorough and exhaustive investigation into the\r\nconditions of poverty in London in 1891. He found that 1,300,000, or\r\nabout 30 per cent. of the population of that city were unable to obtain\r\nthe necessaries of life. This 30 per cent. were “living in conditions, if\r\nnot of actual misery, at any rate bordering upon it.”\r\n\r\nMr. B. S. Rountree made a similar investigation in the typical\r\nprovincial town of York, England. He found that about 28 per cent.\r\nof the inhabitants of York were living in destitution. Mr. Rountree\r\nadds: “We have been accustomed to look upon the poverty of London as\r\nexceptional, but when the result of careful investigation shows that the\r\nproportion of poverty in London is practically equaled in what may be\r\nregarded as a typical provincial town, we are forced to the startling\r\nprobability that from 25 to 30 per cent. of the town populations of the\r\nUnited Kingdom are living in poverty.”\r\n\r\nLet us turn from England to the United States, and see how much poverty\r\nthere is in our own country, among our own workmen, or producing class.\r\n\r\nThe report of the State Board of Charities for New York State shows that\r\nan average of about 26 per cent. of the population were aided, by both\r\nprivate and public charities, during each of the three years 1897, 1898\r\nand 1899; and according to the report of the official statistician of the\r\ncity of Boston for 1903 more than 20 per cent. of the entire population\r\nof that city were aided by the public authorities alone. This does not\r\ninclude private charities. In fact, all statistics of charitable works\r\nare defective, because they can never include the efforts to relieve\r\nsuffering and poverty made by those who do not let the left hand know\r\nwhat the right hand is doing.\r\n\r\nCommenting on the above statistics from Boston and New York State, Mr.\r\nHunter says: “If the figures are correct as published, the persons in\r\nNew York State in distress in 1897, and in Boston in 1903, would equal\r\nproportionately the number of those in poverty in London.”\r\n\r\nHere are other facts about poverty worth remembering: “In the face of\r\nwidespread poverty, there have not been for over half a century in\r\nEngland so few paupers, either actually or proportionately, as there are\r\nnow. The population of England has increased from 18,000,000 persons in\r\n1851 to 29,000,000 in 1889. During this period the number of paupers\r\nactually fell off. London has lost in pauper population fifteen times as\r\nfast as she has gained in general population.”\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the returns from the almshouses in the United States\r\nshow that the number of paupers increased almost as fast as population\r\nduring the decade from 1880 to 1890. In Hartford, Conn., which is said\r\nto be the richest per capita city in the United States, the number of\r\npaupers increased 50 per cent. during this same decade.\r\n\r\nNow, when you hear a Republican spellbinder draw harrowing word-pictures\r\nof poverty among the English workmen, and paint glowing pictures of the\r\nmarvelous wealth and happy condition of the workmen in our own country,\r\nand when you read editorials in subsidized protectionist newspapers about\r\nthe “miseries of the working classes” in free trade England and the great\r\nprosperity among the highly protected workmen of the United States,\r\njust remember that according to the best information obtainable about\r\ntwenty-five to thirty persons out of every hundred living in the towns\r\nand cities _both in England and the United States_ suffer from poverty.\r\nAnd for the past forty years poverty has steadily _decreased_ in England\r\nand steadily and rapidly _increased_ in the United States. And no amount\r\nof ranting by the spellbinder or misrepresentation by the editor can\r\nalter these facts.\r\n\r\nMr. Hunter is of the opinion that 70,000 New York children go to school\r\nunderfed. This statement caused astonishment and doubt in some quarters.\r\nBut I contend that any trained physician who will note the very large\r\npercentage of anemic faces among the children as they issue from the\r\npublic schoolhouses of this city will agree with me that Mr. Hunter’s\r\nestimate of 70,000 underfed children is most likely far below the mark.\r\n\r\nThe Children’s Aid Society and other charitable organizations maintain a\r\nnumber of industrial schools for poor children in this city. The total\r\ndaily average of children attending these schools is 10,707. Inspector\r\nLecktrecker recently made a thorough investigation into the condition\r\nof these children. Mr. Lecktrecker’s report goes into great detail.\r\nSummed up, the report shows that of the 10,707 children attending these\r\nindustrial schools 8,852 are actually underfed by reason of poverty\r\nat home. It was found that the best breakfast that any of these 8,852\r\nchildren had was a piece of bread and a cup of tea or coffee. A diet not\r\nonly inadequate for nourishment, but actually destructive to a child’s\r\nnervous system.\r\n\r\nA grown-up person only requires enough nourishment to repair the waste,\r\nwear and tear incident to the daily activities of brain and muscle. A\r\nchild not only requires this, but it requires added nourishment for the\r\ngrowth and development of all the tissues of its body. No wonder we are\r\nraising up a class of people in this city which I have called in another\r\nplace “Newyorkitics.” No wonder there is an ever-increasing procession\r\nof broken-down brains and nervous systems heading for the hospitals\r\nfor insane. No wonder that crime is on the increase. What better can\r\nbe expected from adults whose brains and nerves have been starved and\r\nstunted from birth?\r\n\r\nBut what exactly is poverty? Destitution of property; indigence; want\r\nof convenient means of subsistence; need. That is what the dictionary\r\nsays poverty is. Want of convenient means of subsistence is the want\r\nof some one or all of the five chemical substances called proximate\r\nprinciples, which we take and must have to sustain animal life. The\r\ncontinual absence of these chemical substances from the human stomach,\r\ntogether with lack of clothing sufficient to protect the body against the\r\nelements, causes physical pain or suffering with degeneration and final\r\ndeath of the animal body. This is a literal scientific definition of the\r\nword poverty as applied to the animal or material man.\r\n\r\nThe adulteration of food which is carried on to such an alarming\r\nextent in the United States is an important factor in this poverty or\r\nunderfeeding question. Even those who are able to buy a sufficient\r\n_quantity_ of food have no assurance that the _quality_ is such as will\r\nproperly nourish their bodies.\r\n\r\nWhen you satisfy the cravings of hunger by putting into the human stomach\r\nwatered milk, or cheese which is part wax, or sugar mixed with plaster of\r\nParis, or chocolate which contains only a suggestion of the rich cacao\r\nbeans, or any of the adulterated articles of food for sale especially in\r\nthe poorer sections of the city, you not only tax the system to digest\r\nand dispose of a quantity of useless and maybe poisonous material, but\r\nevery tissue in the body is thereby robbed of its proper nourishment.\r\n\r\nIt is as much, or more, poverty and underfeeding to fill the stomach with\r\nmaterial which does not contain the five _proximate principles_, _i.e._,\r\nnourishment, as not to fill it at all. The laws against substitution and\r\nadulteration of human food and drink ought to be more stringent than\r\nthe laws against horse stealing. Yet, as I am informed, all efforts at\r\nsuch legislation are invariably met with the cry that it will interfere\r\nwith the _business interests_ of the country. Here, as in so many\r\nother instances, when an attempt is made to secure common justice and\r\nprotection for the lives and property and rights of the plain people, we\r\nrun up against the _business interests_. The curse of this country today\r\nis that everything, even human life, must be sacrificed when necessary to\r\nthe BUSINESS INTERESTS.\r\n\r\nThe industry captains are killing and maiming the people now just as the\r\nmilitary captains used to do, and for the same objects—to satisfy greed\r\nand selfishness.\r\n\r\nThe negro slave in the South in slavery days was further removed from\r\npoverty and the fear of poverty than any man I have ever known. When his\r\nday’s work was finished he came home from the field or the shop and he\r\nfound a substantial, well-cooked dinner awaiting him. After dinner he\r\nwent to his comfortable cabin and sat before a blazing log fire, or, in\r\nwarm weather, he sat out under the stars, fanned by the night winds. His\r\nwife and children were nearly always around him, as were his companions,\r\nthe other slaves belonging to his master and the plantation.\r\n\r\nThis man did not have a single care or responsibility on earth. He did\r\nnot have to meet a grinding landlord next day demanding rent. He did not\r\nhave to cudgel his brains to find a way to meet a note due next week. He\r\ndid not have to pay for food, clothes, light and heat for himself and\r\nhis family. That pang of anguish so familiar to us all when we think of\r\nthe possibility of our loved ones suffering from want and the fear of\r\nwant when we are gone never wrung the heart of that black man. Child\r\nlabor as it exists under the present system was unknown to the children\r\nof the black slaves. “Over the hills to the poor-house,” when age and\r\ndecrepitude had made him no longer useful, had no terrors for the black\r\nslave. The “system” of slavery made it perfectly certain that his owner\r\nwould provide food, clothes and shelter for him in his old days, and\r\nfor his children, no matter what happened. This black man, slave as he\r\nwas, had a better guarantee against poverty and the fear of poverty for\r\nhimself and family than any life insurance company can give. Even Mr. Tom\r\nLawson could not find fault with the security of this policy.\r\n\r\nAnother thing the slave father did not have to worry about was sickness\r\nin his family. When one of his children became ill an ambulance from a\r\ncharity hospital did not back up in front of the negro quarters, cart\r\nthe child off to become one patient more in Ward No. ——, and serve as\r\n“material” for a clinical lecture while it lived, and as “material”\r\nfor the dissecting-table after it was dead. No, nothing of the kind\r\nhappened. When the slave became ill the best medical skill and nursing\r\nwere provided, and, if need be, the patient was taken to the “big house”\r\nwhere the master lived so the mistress could superintend the treatment,\r\nand in case of death the body was put in a neat coffin, and a procession\r\ncomposed of all the blacks and whites on the plantation followed the\r\nremains to the colored graveyard on the hill, burial services were read,\r\na hymn sung and the body lowered to its final resting-place. This is\r\na glimpse at the condition of the slave in life and death in slavery\r\ndays. I am not putting in a brief in favor of chattel slavery. I was\r\nborn an abolitionist. My father was a slave-owner and my early life was\r\nspent in the midst of it, yet I abhorred the system as a child, and that\r\nabhorrence has grown with years. But I am now writing about poverty, and\r\nmy point is: that chattel slavery as it existed in the South is the only\r\nstate of society I know of in which poverty and the fear of poverty among\r\nthe workers or producing class were absolutely abolished by law.\r\n\r\nUnder the old system the negro was a slave, you say. So he was. But if I\r\nread Mr. Hunter’s book aright, the laborer under the present industrial\r\nsystem is also a slave. The laborer has a vote now and the slave did\r\nnot. Yes, but the slave had a full dinner-pail _all the time_ and the\r\nwhite voting laborer has not. The comparative value between his vote and\r\na full dinner-pail in the mind of the white laborer under the present\r\nsystem was demonstrated in the election of 1896 and 1900, when he gladly\r\ngave his vote to the Republican Party for the _mere promise_ of a full\r\ndinner-pail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _Tuck-of-Drum_\r\n\r\n                      BY ALFRED TRESIDDER SHEPPARD\r\n             (Copyright in Great Britain by A. T. Sheppard.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAt nine o’clock Josephine beat a vigorous reveille on the drum that had\r\nled old troops into action. It was the second of December; the sun of\r\nAusterlitz shone on the grass and trees in the little front white garden,\r\nand was fast melting the delicate tracery of fern and frond on the oval\r\nwindow of Monsieur Tuck-of-Drum’s bedroom.\r\n\r\nA curious name, Tuck-of-Drum; the echo of an ancient story told round\r\ncamp-fires long burned out; a scrap of wreckage floating, like its\r\nowner, when the seas of years held so much that was forgotten. Dominique\r\nLaplume was proud of the name; for even the village children, whispering\r\n“Monsieur Tuck-of-Drum” behind his back, brought the flicker of a smile\r\nto his grizzled face and the ghost of a flash to eyes dim and watery with\r\nage.\r\n\r\nOn Austerlitz day, for many years, the drum had roused him from his\r\nslumbers. He had slept heavily, this old warrior; “a thousand thunders!”\r\nhe said sometimes in self-excuse, “when one has made one’s bed as often\r\non straw or the solid ground——”\r\n\r\nHis son, growing from childhood to manhood, plied the drumsticks in\r\nhis time; he fell at Solferino. His son’s son held them in his turn;\r\nthe earth still lay bare and trampled over him at Gravelotte. They had\r\ngiven much to France, these Laplumes. Now Josephine, with her black\r\nsleeves rolled high on her thin white arms, and her dimpled face set into\r\ndesperate earnestness, took her dead father’s place, and thundered at the\r\nparchment until the old man’s husky voice answered the summons.\r\n\r\nHer sabots clattered down the stairs. Coughing and grunting, Monsieur\r\nTuck-of-Drum began to dress. The clothes he had worn the day—and many\r\ndays—before hung from their pegs in a chintz-covered recess. On a\r\nrush-bottomed chair near the bed, carefully brushed and pipeclayed, lay\r\ncoat, and belts, and breeches, and gaiters that had gathered mud, in\r\ntheir time, from half the kingdoms of Europe. On the dressing-table the\r\ncross of the Legion of Honor rested in its little leather case.\r\n\r\nAt last his shaking fingers opened the door. The drum lay outside; the\r\ndrum, and, on the drum, the gigantic bearskin, bullet-bitten in old\r\nfights, moth-marked during long, idle years. He came downstairs in full\r\nregimentals. Madame Laplume was talking to the village postmaster at the\r\nopen door. She ran to meet him. Her eyes were misty, for she remembered\r\nlast year’s reveille; but there was a ring of gladness in her greeting.\r\n\r\n“Good morning, grandfather!” she cried, kissing him on both cheeks; “a\r\nhappy Austerlitz day. There is news, too——”\r\n\r\n“News?” Dying fires flamed up for a second in his old eyes.\r\n\r\n“D’Aurelles de Paladines is driving them back,” she said. “We\r\nwon everywhere yesterday—everywhere. Chanzy has forced the\r\nBavarians back on Orgères. We have taken Guillonville, Terminiers,\r\nMonnerville—and—and—where else, Josephine?”\r\n\r\n“Goniers, Villepain, Faverolles,” little Josephine chimed in, repeating\r\nthe names glibly, like a well-conned lesson.\r\n\r\n“And they say the brave General Duerot has broken out of Paris, and is\r\nmarching to join the Army of the Loire!”\r\n\r\n“Good!”\r\n\r\nMonsieur Tuck-of-Drum sat down stiffly, the joints in his long limbs\r\ncracking; he held the coffee-cup to his lips, but the coffee danced and\r\nsplashed out. He jerked the cup down quickly, and brushed a drop from his\r\nmustache with an impatient hand.\r\n\r\n“It is just as I have said,” he cried suddenly and fiercely, springing\r\nto his feet. “We have them like trapped rats! Did I not say so, Héloïse?\r\nEven the little Josephine has heard me. Listen, Josephine. These Germans,\r\nthese enemies of our dear France, begin to pay for their folly. They\r\nhated us because our great Emperor led us once to all their capitals—to\r\nStuttgart, to Dresden, to Munich, to Berlin—because their kings bowed\r\nhats-in-hand before the soldiers of France; because we cut up their\r\ncountry with our swords as I—look you!—cut this bread of mine.” And with\r\nnervous hands he sliced white, crust-ringed circles from the roll. “But\r\nnow—ah, the Emperor, our great Emperor, is dead; and the Marshals and the\r\nGrande Armée have marched away. They found us asleep, unready; like rats,\r\nlike locusts, they swarmed into our cornfields and our vineyards. But we\r\nare awake at last! We are ready at last! The revenge begins!”\r\n\r\n“It begins,” echoed Madame Laplume. “But come, grandfather, your coffee\r\ngrows cold, and——”\r\n\r\n“The punishment begins!” he continued, his voice shrill as the neigh\r\nof an old war-horse. “Look you!” He held up a gnarled hand. “Here is\r\nDuerot, with the troops of Paris. Here”—he raised the other, its knotted\r\nfingers stretched out—“are De Paladines, Chanzy, De Sonis, Jauréguiberry,\r\nwith the Army of the Loire. Now see; the Germans are between them.” He\r\nsnatched a morsel of the bread he had been cutting and brought his palms\r\ntogether. “The Germans—the Germans——”\r\n\r\n“You have cut your hand, grandfather,” cried Josephine.\r\n\r\nHe stopped, and looked dumbly at his palm. A splinter of crust had grazed\r\nthe skin. The bread rolled to the floor.\r\n\r\n“They are crushed,” he mumbled, bringing down his heel. “Miscreants! that\r\nthey should dare to enter France! But they will pay for their folly; ah,\r\nthey will pay well! I knew; I said it. ‘Wait,’ I said, when they came\r\nto us with their long faces and their stories of defeat. ‘France has\r\nslept; but she will shake herself and awake.’ _Mon Dieu_, yes. Why I—I\r\nwho speak, my little Josephine, put a hundred to flight when I was young,\r\nwith this little drum alone: that is why they call great-grandfather\r\nMonsieur Tuck-of-Drum, my dear. See, it is the sun of Austerlitz that\r\nshines on the white trees. Sixty-five long years ago—sixty-five long\r\nyears ago—the great Emperor pinned this cross on my breast; ‘Ah, this is\r\nMonsieur Tuck-of-Drum,’ he said, pinching my ear, ‘who beat the charge in\r\nthe village, and put a hundred to flight.’ That was nothing; we did those\r\nthings. And again—today—the sun of Austerlitz——”\r\n\r\nHe broke off suddenly as the door opened and a fat old man, with a large,\r\nhairless, foolish face—the face of a great baby, still eying the world\r\nwith wonder—entered the room. He, too, wore the uniform of the Emperor’s\r\nGuard. The veterans embraced.\r\n\r\n“You have heard the news?” cried Laplume. “Ah, it is arranged. Austerlitz\r\nday—the day of Austerlitz—sees victory again for France, my dear\r\nHippolyte. Sit down, sit down. Héloïse mixes the salad. Héloïse! Here is\r\nMonsieur Bergeret. It has been a struggle, my friend, but we have saved\r\na bottle and a snack for today; we have arranged it, I say.” He sniffed,\r\nnudged his comrade and chuckled. A pleasant smell of cooking already\r\npervaded the sitting-room, floating in from the kitchen in the rear.\r\n\r\nMadame Laplume, who had vanished while Dominique was telling the child of\r\nFrance and its ancient glories, reappeared, with bare and powdery arms;\r\nSergeant Hippolyte saluted, and passed a wavering hand over his foolish\r\nchin. Monsieur Tuck-of-Drum, talking garrulously all the while, patted\r\nhis old comrade’s accoutrements into shape; fastened a button; untwisted\r\na red shoulder-knot; rearranged an ill-adjusted strap. Age was dulling\r\nthe Sergeant’s brain a little; “he does not wear as well as I,” thought\r\nTuck-of-Drum, with the pathetic pride of age.\r\n\r\nThere was a metallic “tap-tap” and a clatter of sabots on the cobbles of\r\nthe village street. “Jacques Dufour arrives!” cried Dominique Laplume,\r\nand flung the door open with a flourish.\r\n\r\nIt was like the gathering of ghosts from the past. It _was_ a gathering\r\nof ghosts from the past. These three, with their wrinkled cheeks, their\r\nquavering voices, their scanty white hair, their battered uniforms\r\nand weapons—these three were all that were left of that band of young\r\nrecruits who, in the great days of France, had marched down the village\r\nstreet, shouting the songs of the Empire, blowing kisses to fair faces in\r\nthe windows and the roadsides, exchanging glances with bright eyes that\r\nhad grown dim at last and closed on earth and all its color and glitter.\r\nLike spars, they floated still, scarred and encrusted by the waves of\r\ntime that had engulfed a generation so heroic, stupendous.\r\n\r\nDufour, wrinkled, wizened, twisted with rheumatism, limped to his place.\r\nHis grandson carried his musket and placed it in a corner by Bergeret’s;\r\nthe old man had lost a limb at Quatre Bras and needed a stout stick to\r\naid the wooden leg.\r\n\r\n“I will come again at six, grandfather,” the boy piped shrilly in his\r\near. “I say I will come again to fetch you at six.”\r\n\r\n“No, no; Pierre must stay,” interrupted Monsieur Laplume. “Eh? He must\r\nstay, too, and hear the stories of the olden days—the days of the glories\r\nof France.” The boy’s eyes lit up. “Come, we are ready. He shall sit by\r\nthe little Josephine.”\r\n\r\nBy and bye Madame Laplume brought in the meal, steaming from the oven.\r\nBottles of red wine were ranged on the table.\r\n\r\n“There were five of us last year,” Dufour muttered. “Buffet and Deyrolles\r\nhave dismissed.”\r\n\r\n“Eight the year before,” said Bergeret, rubbing his hands and smiling\r\nvacuously.\r\n\r\n“The ranks grow thin, comrades,” said Laplume. “Well, the first toast!”\r\n\r\nThey rose, and drank in silence to the memory of that great man whom they\r\nhad fought and bled and suffered for long since—and still remembered and\r\nadored. They drank to the old Marshals, to the Grande Armée, to village\r\ncomrades whose bones lay in the Peninsula, in Germany, in Belgium, in the\r\nchurchyards of France, but whose faces, dim and mournful, still looked\r\nat them through the mists of years, and whose voices still echoed in\r\ntheir memories. They lit cigars and pipes; but the room was full of the\r\nsmoke of ancient battles. They talked of Desaix, Bessières, Junot, Murat,\r\nLannes, Masséna, Ney—the old, unforgotten names. If they could come\r\nagain! Ah, if _he_ could come again—how the scattered remnants of his\r\nlost legions would rally round him, and young France hurry to the eagles,\r\nand the glorious days return!\r\n\r\n“But we are making an end; we are making an end,” cried Tuck-of-Drum\r\nfiercely, bringing down his fist and making plates and bottles jump with\r\nthe vehemence of the blow. “Chanzy and Duerot have them in the trap at\r\nlast. I said so—did I not? Even the little Josephine remembers. On the\r\nday of Austerlitz——”\r\n\r\nAn ominous booming, distant, sullen, like an echo of old years of strife,\r\nsounded in their ears.\r\n\r\n“It is thunder!” cried Pierre. Little Josephine clutched her mother’s arm.\r\n\r\nThe veterans exchanged glances. “What the devil—” began Laplume. They\r\nflung open the door and stepped into the village street. Two or three\r\npeople, white-faced, had stopped to listen.\r\n\r\nThe distant guns roared again. What were they doing there—then—in that\r\ndirection? Tuck-of-Drum looked puzzled, doubtful. This day of all the\r\nyear, this great day of his life, was bound up with all his thoughts;\r\none hope, one conviction, possessed him, and had shone steadily through\r\nall the gloom of the last few months. The day of Austerlitz would see\r\nthe eagle turn upon its foes; the sun of Austerlitz would look down upon\r\nthe invading army scattered like chaff before the wind—crushed, rather,\r\nlike grain between the two millstones, the armies of Paris and the Loire.\r\nThe previous day’s successes confirmed him. But what were the guns doing\r\nthere? The fighting should be far beyond Orgères by this time. He beat\r\ndown a flicker of uncertainty.\r\n\r\n“Bah, it goes well,” he muttered. “They make their last stand. Come,\r\ncomrades, let us drink to Chanzy and the Army of the Loire.”\r\n\r\nPoor, foolish Bergeret soon fell asleep, huddled in his chair; but the\r\nwine put fire into the veins of his comrades. Pierre and Josephine\r\nlistened round-eyed as they talked of bivouacs and camp-fires; of ancient\r\ncomrades and conquered cities; of Austerlitz and the heights of Pratzen,\r\nand the Menitz Lake.\r\n\r\n“Sixty-five years ago at this very hour”—so the talk went on. “Do you\r\nremember? Have you forgotten?” They argued, they shouted, in their old\r\nvoices that broke from gruffness into shrill quavers, ludicrous under\r\nother circumstances, but now pathetic. They moved bottles, glasses,\r\nsalt-cellars, to illustrate the disposition of troops; in the blue\r\nsmoke-clouds the children, drinking in their words, could almost catch\r\nthe glint of the Cuirassiers’ breastplates, the glittering gold-lacing\r\nof the Hussars, the rise and fall of green epaulets as the voltigeurs\r\nmoved into line, the yellow facings of Oudinot’s Grenadiers, the\r\nclamorous mêlée of horse and foot. They discussed the present fighting,\r\nthe mistakes of generals; and here Héloïse, eager as they for the success\r\nof the cause which had cost her husband’s life, joined in with the names\r\nand dates and figures at her tongue’s tip. In the distance the sullen\r\nguns were booming.\r\n\r\n“If I were with them!” sighed Tuck-of-Drum. “They had no room for the old\r\nsoldier; yet I can beat a charge as well as ever! I—I who speak, could\r\nfire a musket with the best of them!”\r\n\r\n“Grandfather volunteered,” piped Josephine.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Héloïse, eying the old man proudly; “but they wanted him\r\nto take care of us. ‘You must look after the women and children for\r\nus, Monsieur Laplume,’ said the officer. ‘You have done your share for\r\nFrance in the field. You know what our great Emperor wrote, “It will\r\nbe sufficient for you to say, ‘I was at the battle of Austerlitz,’ to\r\nauthorize the reply, ‘Behold, a brave man.’”’”\r\n\r\nDominique Laplume waved a hand in depreciation, as if to brush aside\r\nthe praise. “A brave man? Every Frenchman is brave. It is in the blood\r\nof France. We need not be proud of what we cannot help. We have been\r\nunfortunate, yes; badly led, yes; but the men—the men——”\r\n\r\nThe door opened suddenly. The village postmaster stood again at the\r\nentrance, his eyes starting, his face lemon-colored, his lips livid\r\nunder the straggling beard. “All is lost!” he cried. “We are betrayed,\r\ndefeated! Chanzy is driven back! The enemy advances!”\r\n\r\nThe door rattled in the grasp of his shaking hand. He limped off to\r\nspread the news of the disaster, which grew with his terror. Laplume,\r\nDufour, Madame Héloïse, started to their feet and looked at each other\r\nblankly. The sudden, awe-struck silence woke Bergeret, who looked round\r\nwith wide, foolish eyes. Josephine’s mouth twitched and tears gathered.\r\nPierre clenched his brown fists.\r\n\r\n“Come,” cried Monsieur Tuck-of-Drum suddenly. He donned the great\r\nbearskin, the others followed his example, Bergeret fumbling foolishly\r\nwith its heavy chain. His baby face expressed wonder rather than the\r\nalarm, the bitter disappointment, the wrath, written on the faces of\r\nMadame Héloïse and Laplume and Dufour. Tuck-of-Drum girded on his sword\r\nand slung the straps of his drum over his old bent shoulders. He thrust\r\nBergeret’s musket into the Sergeant’s hand. Dufour motioned to Pierre,\r\nand hobbled out; the boy followed him. Madame Héloïse Laplume ran to the\r\ndoor to intercept them. “Where are you going, grandfather? Where are you\r\ngoing?” she gasped.\r\n\r\n“Stand back, Héloïse. We go to call the village. Stay here; stay with the\r\nlittle Josephine.”\r\n\r\nShe paused irresolute. After all, though they could do no good, what harm\r\ncould they do—these three old men? They were going to call the village.\r\nYet there was a look on the ancient soldier’s face she had not seen since\r\nthe day of the first great reverse, when he had gone, with his head erect\r\nand old fires flashing in his dim blue eyes, to offer his feeble services\r\nto France.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, loud and distinct above the distant booming of the guns, his\r\ndrum sounded—beating an assembly in the quiet village street. She put her\r\nhand to her breast and ran out. If the Germans were really coming——\r\n\r\nShe clutched his arm.\r\n\r\n“Are you mad, grandfather?” she gasped. “Come in; come in and finish your\r\nwine and pipes together. There are only boys and women and old men in the\r\nvillage. They can do nothing——”\r\n\r\nHe shook her off.\r\n\r\nWell, even the enemy, cruel though they were, could never harm men so\r\nold, so feeble and defenseless. They would ride through, laughing in\r\ntheir beards, mouthing their uncouth jokes at the faded uniforms from\r\nwhich their sires had once fled in terror; but—no, they would never harm\r\nthem. Josephine was crying softly within. She turned back to the house.\r\n\r\nUp the centre of the village street marched Tuck-of-Drum, drumming,\r\ndrumming with an energy surprising and pathetic, as though he could call\r\nfrom their weed-grown graves the lads who had once jumped so smartly to\r\nthe rattle of the parchment.\r\n\r\n“_Rat-a-plan! rat-a-plan!_” sounded the summons; his hands had not lost\r\ntheir cunning, though they ached and grew weary with the unwonted strain.\r\nBehind him staggered Bergeret, his great bearskin toppling forward over\r\nthe fat, smooth, foolish face; Dufour hobbled in the rear, his stick and\r\nwooden leg tapping the cobbles; little Pierre, beside him, dragged the\r\nheavy musket.\r\n\r\nPale faces, working in terror, peered from the café of the Boule d’Or.\r\nTuck-of-Drum burst open the door. On the little tables glasses of bock,\r\ntiny glasses of spirits, stood half emptied. The men had all risen;\r\nthe tawdry, gilded mirrors, cracked and dusty, distorted their faces,\r\nshowing them more pallid, more unhealthy even than in life. Three or\r\nfour old men—not so old as the veterans by many years—three or four\r\nwashed-out-looking lads, rejected even by the army that had dragged\r\nmen in from the very highways and hedges to resist the invaders—turned\r\nstartled looks on the newcomers.\r\n\r\n“The enemy is coming!” said Tuck-of-Drum. “Comrades, let us march against\r\nthem, like the men of Dreux, of Châteauneuf! Look—the sun of Austerlitz\r\nis going down! Today, all France must help——”\r\n\r\nThey exchanged glances; they huddled together like sheep.\r\n\r\n“What is the use?” one muttered.\r\n\r\n“Aye, what is the use?”\r\n\r\nA youth sniggered vacuously. “You are sixty years too late, Monsieur\r\nTuck-of-Drum. If the great Emperor could come back now, if France had a\r\nman—” The speaker shrugged his shoulders, spread out his hands with a\r\ngesture of helplessness and looked round for assent.\r\n\r\n“If—if—if!” cried Dominique Laplume. “_We_ will lead you—we, of the\r\nGrand Army! Today all France must rise. All must help. It is the great\r\neffort. Today France conquers—or is conquered. ‘If’ never won a battle.\r\nCome, I say! Jules Brienne, your grandfather carried an eagle at Marengo.\r\nMonsieur Grenier, your uncle fell by our side, fighting bravely, on the\r\nfield of Austerlitz.”\r\n\r\nHe argued, ordered, entreated; in vain.\r\n\r\n“Bah! Poltroons!” he muttered, and turned on his heel.\r\n\r\nAgain the drum sounded.\r\n\r\n“Yes, go out and play with your toy, Papa Tuck-of-Drum,” cried young\r\nBrienne after him. Laplume did not hear. They marched next to the Café de\r\nl’Ecu. The village postmaster, shaking still and casting nervous looks\r\nround him like a frightened horse, was telling his story to a similar\r\nassembly.\r\n\r\n“Pah!” muttered old Dufour, twirling his thin mustache, “these villages\r\nare the rubbish heaps of France. The men are all away.” Again the appeal\r\nwas made. A fat man, with fishy eyes and yellow, pendulous cheeks,\r\nshrugged his shoulders and raised protesting hands. “What can we do? What\r\ncan we do?”\r\n\r\n“They would finish us all with a volley. We should be killed,” whined\r\nanother man.\r\n\r\n“Killed? And what then?” Laplume snorted with fierce contempt.\r\n\r\n“Let us be killed then!” broke in Dufour, crashing his stick down on the\r\nsanded floor. “It would be worth it. A thousand times worth it! Let each\r\nvillage in France raise a wall of dead against the invaders!”\r\n\r\nBergeret nodded his foolish head again and again with emphasis. The fat\r\nman began to talk fast, volubly, excitedly, pouring torrents of abuse\r\non the Emperor, generals, government, the enemy, waving his fat hands,\r\nshrugging his fat shoulders. The curtained door of the café opened. He\r\nstopped suddenly and lamely. A countryman burst in.\r\n\r\n“They are coming—they are coming!” he shrieked. “I have seen them in\r\nthe road. I ran through the woods. Hundreds of them! I have seen their\r\nlances—the sun on their lances!”\r\n\r\n“Come!” cried Dominique Laplume in a voice of thunder. “In the name of\r\nFrance!”\r\n\r\nNo one stirred. He looked round, scorn in his old eyes. “We will\r\ngo, then—Bergeret, Dufour—my old comrades.” His voice choked with\r\nbewilderment, disappointment, anger.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey went out. The air was sharp with frost. It was very still in the\r\nvillage. The sun, a red ball of fire, still glowed on the frosted trees;\r\non the white and yellow walls of the cottages; on the white fields and\r\nwhite-cowled windmills; on the powdered cobbles of the street. A segment\r\nof moon, strangely like a pierrot head, thrust through curtains of cloud,\r\nits mouth whimsically awry, peered down sideways at the earth—at the\r\nwhite earth, where legions of tiny men, like ants, hurried to kill or\r\nbe killed in their bewildering quarrels. The distances were blue—the\r\nshimmering steel-blue of winter distances. Here and there a column of\r\nblack smoke, shot through again and again with tongues of fire, went\r\nup to heaven; the smoke of burning villages; little sacrifices France\r\noffered for her folly to gods not yet appeased.\r\n\r\n“To the bridge,” said Tuck-of-Drum. They marched in silence. The drum was\r\nsilent. At the end of the long, straggling street a tiny bridge spanned a\r\nfrozen stream which the enemy must cross. By the side of it was a clump\r\nof bushes, so thick that, even leafless, they formed a screen behind\r\nwhich the veterans and the boy crouched down.\r\n\r\n“They might have broken down the bridge at least,” grumbled Dufour.\r\n“Menitz was frozen, and the Emperor——”\r\n\r\n“They are coming!” whispered Pierre.\r\n\r\nHis sharp ears, close to the ground, had caught the _clip-clop_ of\r\napproaching hoofs.\r\n\r\nTuck-of-Drum drew his sword and rested its hilt on the rough wooden\r\nparapet of the bridge. “Fix bayonets!” he growled.\r\n\r\nSergeant Bergeret should have given the word, but he carried out the\r\norder placidly, drawing the sword from its scabbard and fixing it with\r\nhis fumbling fingers. “Put it in for me,” muttered Dufour, handing his\r\nbayonet to Pierre. “Now give me the musket—so—and run home, good lad.\r\nEmbrace me and then run home.”\r\n\r\nHe sat on the ground, his wooden leg stiff and straight in front of him,\r\nand clutched the bayonet. Pierre’s lips tightened; he did not move. “Go\r\nhome, I say!”\r\n\r\n“Hush, they come!” whispered Tuck-of-Drum.\r\n\r\nPeering through the brushwood, they could see, on the road ahead, the\r\npennoned lances of German Uhlans, rising and falling with the jolting of\r\nthe horses. The hoofs clicked louder and louder on the frozen road.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Tuck-of-Drum sprang up.\r\n\r\n“The Guard will advance,” he growled, with a little hoarse laugh, the\r\nfaint echo of one that men now dead had heard and talked of, long since.\r\nJoy, fierce, savage joy of fighting, dormant so long but not extinct,\r\nflared up and flashed in his faded eyes. And yet, with the joy, a rage\r\nterrible and righteous shook him as he saw the glitter of the steel, the\r\nfluttering pennons, the casques and foreign uniforms—the foes of France,\r\nviolating the sacred soil of which the dust of his race had made.\r\n\r\nHis trembling hands clutching the drumsticks, he advanced to the centre\r\nof the bridge. Bergeret stood on his right, his bayonet extended. Dufour\r\ngrasped the parapet, dragged himself up, groaning in spite of clenched\r\nteeth, planted his wooden leg firmly, and, leaning against the woodwork\r\nof the bridge, rested the butt of his weapon on the ground, the tremulous\r\nsteel pointed toward the enemy. Pierre came to help him. “Go back! go\r\nback!” he growled, pushing the boy aside with all his feeble strength.\r\nPierre slipped on the frozen earth and fell, clutching at the bushes.\r\nSuddenly Dominique Laplume sounded the _pas de charge_.\r\n\r\nA strange, pitiful defiance this, echoing back through the deserted\r\nvillage street, floating mournfully out to the white, empty fields,\r\nsending its arrogant, useless challenge to the ribbon of white road\r\nahead. “_Rat-a-plan! rat-a-plan!_” The old drum, that had sent a hundred\r\nmen flocking like sheep before it—the old drum that Jules, who fell at\r\nSolferino, that Dominique, who fell at Gravelotte, had beaten on winter\r\nmornings of their boyhood—answered nobly to this last great effort, and\r\nseemed a living, sentient thing, entering into the brave spirit of the\r\nchallenge.\r\n\r\nThere was a startled shout, a clatter of stones, as the Uhlans reined in\r\ntheir horses.\r\n\r\n“They fly!” shrieked Tuck-of-Drum; “they—ah!”\r\n\r\nHalf a dozen carbines shot up and flashed fire. There was a hoarse cry in\r\nGerman; an officer struck aside the stock of a man’s weapon.\r\n\r\nDufour’s bayonet clattered down; he slid into the thicket, his wooden\r\nleg scoring a long, jagged line in the frosty road. Bergeret was on his\r\nknees, a light of strange intelligence dawning in his smooth, foolish\r\nface; quite suddenly he fell sideways on to his fallen bearskin, matted\r\nalready with his blood.\r\n\r\nTuck-of-Drum still stood in the centre of the bridge. The drumsticks\r\ndescended on a drum pierced and soundless—then dropped, one after the\r\nother, slowly, from his nerveless grasp. The world swung around him. The\r\npoplars down the roadway on which his glazing eyes were fixed marched,\r\ndoubled, moved into echelon and square. “_La Grande Armée! La Grande\r\nArmée!_”\r\n\r\nWas it the cry of the Germans, in wonder, in derision, in pity? Or did\r\nhis quivering lips frame the words? Ghosts formed round him; the ghosts\r\nof the old battalions who had marched, long back, into silence. They\r\nswayed, they heaved, in countless numbers; file after file, rank after\r\nrank, regiment after regiment, formed up, doubled into place, and passed\r\nhim by. He saw the flash of breastplates, the crimson fronts of the\r\nPolish lancers, the red plumes of the line, the bearskins of the Guards,\r\nthe glittering eagles of France.\r\n\r\n“My comrades—O my comrades!” He staggered forward, with stretched-out\r\nhands. A confused murmur buzzed in his ears; it swelled into a\r\ntumult—“_and the shout of a king was among them_.”\r\n\r\nOne hand sought the bearskin. Suddenly he fell face forward.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUnder the wide sky, in the uniform of their dead Emperor, the three\r\nveterans lay together; a young boy crouched near them, bleeding from an\r\nunnoticed wound, and sobbing.\r\n\r\nA night wind crept over the frozen fields; a little wind, like a sigh\r\nfrom France for her ruined homes, her smoking villages, her slain\r\nchildren, her lost cause and faded glories.\r\n\r\nThe sun of Austerlitz sank down behind the poplars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _The Royal Road to Learning_\r\n\r\n\r\nFREDDIE—What’s an honorary degree, dad?\r\n\r\nJOHNSON—That’s a title a college confers on a man who would never be able\r\nto get it if he had to pass an examination.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe hardest kind of work is looking for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                _The Southern Negro as a Property-Owner_\r\n\r\n                          BY LEONORA BECK ELLIS\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween the Southern negro as property and the Southern negro as\r\na property-owner worthy of account, American progress has set its\r\nmilestones thick and strongly marked. Yet, as mere years go, the time has\r\nbeen short indeed for a transition of meanings so vast.\r\n\r\nThe act of emancipation brought in its train several very serious\r\nproblems, and more than one of these must be acknowledged to have grown\r\ngraver with further-reaching complexities and involutions as the decades\r\nhave passed. But in the present article these are not under consideration.\r\n\r\nThe point we desire to emphasize is that one of the most difficult\r\nquestions brought to issue in the emancipation of the negro has already\r\nsolved itself by what we are accustomed to call natural processes.\r\n\r\nWhen the epochal pen-stroke fell and $3,000,000,000 worth of Southern\r\nproperty was suddenly obliterated as property, yet stood there in plain\r\nworld’s view, like the metamorphosed dragon’s teeth, as men with the\r\nrights of men, there were masters of statecraft everywhere who faced one\r\nanother blankly, asking how such a situation was to resolve itself. Not\r\neven the most sanguine saw any reason to hope that so complex an issue\r\nas that involved in the relation of the freedmen to the land could be\r\nbrought to satisfactory or righteous solution until at least three or\r\nfour generations had mingled dust with dust.\r\n\r\nThe relation of the freedmen to the soil! Here was the problem that must\r\nhave given pause to an older state, a European nation, say, upon the eve\r\nof liberating at one stroke four millions of serfs.\r\n\r\nBut young nations, like young individuals, often let their deep\r\nconvictions sweep them unprepared into strange conditions and perils,\r\nfrom which only the magnificent vitality of youth rescues them without\r\ndisaster.\r\n\r\nThe United States Government has, for half a dozen years past, recognized\r\nit as a duty to compile and offer for public reading certain facts and\r\nfigures relating to the progress of the negro in acquiring education,\r\nfollowing different pursuits and trades, and accumulating property. Out\r\nof the various reports upon these subjects issued from the Department of\r\nLabor since 1897 it is probably the information set forth regarding the\r\nproperty-holdings of the former slaves and slaves’ children in three or\r\nfour Southern states that will strike the greatest number of people with\r\nsurprise, even with that form of astonishment which borders on unbelief.\r\nYet this surprise is of the healthful type, and the unbelief passes when\r\na closer investigation is made into the matter.\r\n\r\nThe closer investigation is undoubtedly worth while, and it will prove\r\nprofitable for a little while to exchange general statements and sweeping\r\nsurveys for definite figures, well verified data and typical cases within\r\na limited territory.\r\n\r\nTherefore, to illustrate clearly that particular phase of the negro’s\r\nprogress, the adjustment of his relations to the land and his steadily\r\nadvancing gains in real estate and other property-holdings, it will\r\nserve best to take the state of Georgia and present certain comparative\r\ndata relating to the situation here.\r\n\r\nOur choice of the commonwealth of Georgia for the setting forth of\r\nthis matter, instead of some sister state, can be easily justified.\r\nAlthough the youngest of the original thirteen states, and the only\r\none whose early constitution barred slavery from its boundaries, yet,\r\nwhen the Civil War came on Georgia had long been a slave state of great\r\nimportance, and at once took a leading part in the struggle. Her people\r\nsuffered heavier losses from the war, it is authoritatively claimed, than\r\nthose of any other state except Virginia, the old order of things being\r\nmore utterly wrecked and old landmarks more completely effaced here than\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nThere are other reasons for our choice less disputable even than these.\r\nGeorgia has the largest area of any state east of the Mississippi River,\r\nand, in her great sweep of 59,475 square miles, from the Appalachian\r\nMountains to the Atlantic Ocean, exhibits the greatest diversity of soil,\r\nclimate and physical features, all of which must be conceded to affect\r\nnegro life and industry. Lying largely in the so-called “Black Belt,” the\r\nstate still presents quite as marked a diversity of social conditions as\r\nof physical, nor have any of the former slave-holding states been more\r\nstrongly affected than this by the industrial and educational movements\r\nwhich have stirred the South within the last few years. It is only\r\nfair to call attention, likewise, to the fact that, while Georgia is\r\nrecognized as the centre of some of the most radical thought and action\r\nupon the negro question, yet this condition is counterbalanced by the\r\nexistence within its borders of a mass of white voters who seem more than\r\nordinarily swayed by an intense sense of justice to the black. Witness\r\nthe manner in which all bills tending toward negro disfranchisement meet\r\nsummary defeat before the Georgia Legislature, and, again, the defeat of\r\nthe last year’s movement to divide the state’s educational funds in such\r\na way as to allow to colored schools only the pro rata share representing\r\ntaxes on the property of the negro.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it may be added here, that while the state has no Hampton\r\nor Tuskeegee within her borders, still she has most excellent public\r\nschools for negroes, and in several cities she is now giving them\r\nadmirable training in manual and industrial arts along with the academic\r\nstudies, as, notably, at Columbus; and she also has an important branch\r\nof her state university devoted to the industrial, technical and manual\r\ntraining of colored youths—that is, the Industrial College for Negroes at\r\nSavannah, a high-grade institution wholly supported by public funds.\r\n\r\nIf the selection of Georgia for a local study of the negro’s material\r\nprogress does not yet appear justified, then the last, and in itself\r\nwholly adequate, reason may now be assigned, namely, that the state\r\nhas the largest negro population of any in the Union, her colored\r\npeople numbering 1,034,998, or a bare trifle under 50 per cent. of the\r\nentire population. Observe that in this state are congregated more than\r\none-eighth as many blacks as are scattered throughout the remaining half\r\na hundred states and territories of the Union.\r\n\r\nNew Year’s Day of 1863 saw 470,000 freedmen in Georgia, these in the\r\nmain having been ushered into liberty in quite as destitute a condition,\r\nregarding land and other worldly possessions, as that in which they\r\nwere ushered into existence. The exceptions to this generally prevalent\r\ndestitution were favored slaves here and there whose former masters and\r\nmistresses, too often nearly destitute themselves, had deeded them little\r\nhomesteads, or in some other way given them a start in independence.\r\nOr, again, there were exceptions in the case of the few thousands upon\r\nwhom General Sherman and his associates had bestowed certain donatives\r\nin the shape of wages, usually unearned, and bounty money or lands, all\r\ndistributed with the injudiciousness expected in such a situation.\r\n\r\nToday, barely one generation’s space removed from that hour of strange\r\nand sorrowful conditions, these freedmen and their children pay taxes\r\non more than a million acres of Georgia land, not to mention houses,\r\nhousehold goods, stock, agricultural implements, merchandise and other\r\ntaxable properties. If the situation speaks well for American life and\r\nopportunities, it also speaks well for the black man, and more eloquently\r\nstill for his chances in the South.\r\n\r\nThe toilsome processes by which the Georgia negro has climbed from\r\ndestitution to his present state of comparative prosperity deserve more\r\nthan a passing glance. Do not think it was the same as if you or your\r\nneighbor, or even Mr. Riis’s European, who is to be refashioned into an\r\nAmerican, should start today without money or lands, without friends\r\nexcept those destitute as yourselves. We should know where to turn, what\r\nwork to take up, how to apply whatever of skill or energy or special\r\naptitudes might exist within us. Failing of skill or marked aptitudes\r\nof our own, failing even of an ordinarily good education, we should at\r\nleast have within us inherited instincts to help us out of the difficult\r\nsituation. Above all, we should know what was in the world, what was\r\nworth striving for, where to set our aims.\r\n\r\nBut what of skill did the negro have, save in the rudimentary forms\r\nof agriculture? Whither, save for restraining influences, would his\r\ninherited instincts have led him? What did he know of life experientially\r\nbeyond the log square of a slave’s cabin, or by observation and hearsay\r\nbeyond the compass of the plantation lord’s domain?\r\n\r\nNo; set it down that the new freedman was poorer than the poorest, and,\r\nexcept in rare cases, more ignorant than can now be readily conceived of.\r\nIn such condition, with no higher aims to impel him to work than the bare\r\ninstinct of self-preservation, his work must of necessity be for many\r\nyears only a bread-meat-and-shelter matter.\r\n\r\nYet, somehow—who can tell by what strange evolution?—working on blindly,\r\ngropingly, toilsomely, he has still contrived to press forward, until\r\ntoday, with a generation scarcely gone, he stands on a plane no one\r\ncounted on his reaching under a hundred years. And the best of all his\r\ngains is that the most intelligent of his race have come to comprehend\r\nwhat true progress means, and to compare the slight space traversed by\r\ntheir people with the vast upward stretch reaching away in front of them.\r\n\r\nDuring one of the large conventions which recently met in a Georgia\r\ncity, a visitor from New England asked me, with genuine concern: “But\r\nwhere do your better class negroes live? Or are there no blacks decently\r\nhoused, no places at least approximately clean and comfortable that they\r\ncan claim as homes? In various cities through your section I have found\r\nonly swarming and fetid negro quarters, the worst of slums, a menace to\r\nmunicipal health, both physical and moral. Is there nothing more hopeful\r\nthan this to show for the race?”\r\n\r\nAdmitting the general truth of his imputation, I was still able to\r\npoint out to him a few streets, or sections of streets, where the most\r\nintelligent and prosperous of the blacks of the city had made themselves\r\nreal homes. Yet even these, he demurred, bordered too close upon those\r\nsame slums he had been fretting over. For in Southern cities the people\r\nof this race keep together, it will be noted.\r\n\r\nBut I told my guest to come with me to the country if he would see the\r\nnegro at his racial best. Agriculture, I assured him, had come very near\r\nto spelling out salvation for this people. Instance the state conference\r\nof colored farmers convening not so very long ago in Savannah. Nearly two\r\nhundred delegates were present, and everyone owned his own home, many\r\nbeing comparatively wealthy. One in particular was pointed out as worth\r\n$50,000, made entirely from agriculture.\r\n\r\nIn the country, then, we must still look for the best average of the\r\nnegro’s home, his domestic life and virtues, as well as his industry\r\nand thrift. A brief investigation of conditions brought our New England\r\nfriend to the same conclusion, and he went away much better satisfied as\r\nto the prospects of the race.\r\n\r\nCertain facts and figures which interested this intelligent student of\r\nracial conditions will doubtless interest scores of others, and they are,\r\ntherefore, offered in the present paper.\r\n\r\nGeorgia has 137 counties, each constituting a small commonwealth\r\nin itself. Being settled at irregular periods and under diverse\r\ncircumstances, varying, moreover, in topography and character of the soil\r\nand climate, these counties exhibit each a different ratio of the negroes\r\nto the whites.\r\n\r\nA glance at the maps may aid in forming a clear idea of the movements and\r\ngrowth of the black population in Georgia. In 1790, it will be observed,\r\nthe counties near the coast were the only ones settled, and if the black\r\nfolk were inconsiderable in numbers, so were the white.\r\n\r\nBut by 1800 the slaves were showing a rapid increase, and were being\r\nmoved up the Savannah River, while from that time to 1840 the population,\r\nboth white and black, exhibited a marked tendency to seek the rich lands\r\nof the interior, pushing westward and, a little later, southwestward.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the year 1900 the blacks of the state had increased from\r\nthe few thousands of slaves of a century back, held chiefly on the coast,\r\nto more than a million free people, fairly well dispersed through all but\r\nthe extreme mountain counties and paying taxes on many million dollars of\r\nGeorgia property.\r\n\r\nFrom the office of the comptroller-general of the state there is issued\r\nannually a full report of the property-holdings of both blacks and\r\nwhites, set forth with exactness of detail county by county. From the\r\nfile of these reports it is easy to make a comparative study, in brief\r\nor at length, of past changes, progress or retrogression, and the present\r\nstatus in any or all of the Georgia counties. But the general reader will\r\nbe able to draw his conclusions from a glance at a few of these.\r\n\r\nChatham County, the original seat of settlement, is perhaps the best\r\nstarting-point. It is located in Southeastern Georgia, washed by the\r\nSavannah River and the tides of the Atlantic, has for its county seat\r\nSavannah, the second city of the state, and comprises mainly a stretch\r\nof marshland, low islands and flat, sandy tracts. In early days a brisk\r\nslave trade brought many negroes to this county, and since the war\r\nthe city of Savannah has attracted the freedmen in great numbers. The\r\nrelations between whites and blacks have been more uniformly cordial\r\nhere than elsewhere, the former being in the main of the original\r\nslave-holding class, and the latter largely house servants. The situation\r\nis thus in direct contrast to that in Atlanta, for instance. By the year\r\n1790 there were already 8,313 blacks in Chatham County, as against 2,456\r\nwhites; while the census of a hundred years later shows an increase to\r\n54,757 negroes and 22,966 whites.\r\n\r\nSherman’s celebrated field order, issued immediately after his investment\r\nof Savannah, gave hundreds of former slaves temporary possession of\r\nvaluable lands on the coast and sea islands of this county, as it did to\r\na lesser extent in certain other sections of the state. This tenure was\r\nin some cases brief, but in many others became permanent. Hence, even\r\nas early as 1875, we find the freedmen owning 1,491 acres of Chatham’s\r\nland, valued at upward of $70,000, besides town and city realty worth\r\n$152,760. Twenty-five years later they had multiplied these figures by\r\nfour, approximately. No bad showing, when all things are taken into\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nAnother coast county, Liberty, is beyond doubt the most interesting in\r\nits history of all the so-called “black counties.” This, too, is located\r\nin the southeastern portion of Georgia, a neighbor of Chatham’s, with\r\nmuch the same climate and topographical features, and was laid out in\r\n1777. But the history of its first settlers deserves to be traced much\r\nfurther back, for, in 1695, there had come to South Carolina a little\r\ncolony of New England Puritans, breaking off from the parent church\r\nat Dorchester, Mass., and led by Joseph Soul, a Harvard graduate and\r\nteacher. Their location in South Carolina having proved unhealthful, they\r\nwere attracted by Oglethorpe’s little Georgia settlement, and, having\r\nsecured a grant of 32,000 acres on the present site of Liberty County,\r\nthey removed thither in 1752, their colony then numbering 280 whites and\r\n536 negro slaves! The county was laid off as Midway, but later changed\r\nits name to Liberty. It should be remarked that when secession from the\r\nUnion became an issue this county voted solidly against it.\r\n\r\nAfter the Civil War the land here was thrown largely on the market, and\r\nat several places, notably Woodville, Ogeechee and Belmont, numbers of\r\nnegroes united themselves into colonies and bought extensive tracts.\r\nThere are now in the county nearly ten thousand negroes, with half that\r\nnumber of whites; and the former own more than 50,000 acres of land.\r\n\r\nAppling is a county also in the southeastern portion of the state, but\r\npresenting a very different showing. It is a level county, inland, with\r\npoor soil, and the tide of slaves poured around it without touching it.\r\nIn 1820 there were just eighty-six negroes within its borders. When\r\nmanumission came there were only about seven hundred Appling County\r\nslaves to be set free. At the present time it is estimated that there are\r\n3,000 negroes in the county, with more than twice that number of whites.\r\nBut from the comptroller-general’s latest report it appears that the\r\nformer own 17,946 acres of land, such land as it is!\r\n\r\nNow run up to Central Georgia. Here is found the flourishing city\r\nof Macon, in the county of Bibb. The census of 1890 gave Macon a\r\npopulation of 22,746, of whom one-half were negroes. The land in this\r\nsection is hilly, with soil mixed, good and bad. Twenty-five years ago\r\nthere were something over 11,000 negroes in the county, outnumbering\r\nthe whites by nearly two thousand, and they owned 2,611 acres of land.\r\nNow the blacks have a trifle more than doubled in numbers, as well as\r\nin property-holdings. Observe, too, the higher value of the negro’s\r\nfarm lands in this section. His 4,500 acres of Bibb County land is now\r\nassessed at $413,300, which amount, added to his town and city realty and\r\nother taxable properties, makes an aggregate value of $719,380 in this\r\ncounty alone.\r\n\r\nA little to the northeast of Bibb County lies Baldwin, of which\r\nMilledgeville, the former state capital, is the chief town. This was a\r\nvery wealthy ante-bellum section, with large holdings in slaves as well\r\nas lands. When the Civil War began Baldwin County could muster 5,000\r\nslaves, although of the whites, rich and poor, there were only 4,000.\r\nWhen the census of 1890 was taken the negroes had increased to 9,343, the\r\nwhites only to 5,262. Last year the negroes were paying taxes on 6,501\r\nacres of Baldwin County land, valued at $26,599, besides a large amount\r\nof city and town property and other possessions, the whole aggregating\r\n$104,592.\r\n\r\nTake another county in Middle Georgia, a county of good lands but without\r\na town of any size in it, therefore representing more nearly a plain\r\nagricultural average. Any one of a score might be selected. Let us say\r\nButts, a small but prosperous county which was laid out in 1825 and at\r\nthe outbreak of the war had 3,082 slaves and 3,375 whites. A quarter of a\r\ncentury ago its freedmen, numbering approximately 4,000 people, owned but\r\nninety-seven acres of land in the entire county and $350 worth of town\r\nproperty. Have they climbed since 1875? In numbers they are now estimated\r\nat 7,000, against a like number of whites, and last year these negroes\r\npaid taxes on 1,613 acres of good average farming land, and on other\r\nproperty which ran the total valuation in Butts up to $49,941.\r\n\r\nIn the mountain counties of Georgia it has been different, the increase\r\nin number of negroes as well as their possessions being slow and\r\nuncertain, while the whites have maintained a steady progress in such\r\nsections. This, however, is clearly accounted for by the lesser ratio\r\nthe agricultural interests bear to others in mountainous districts, and\r\nthe dependence of the negroes upon the former. Glance at Gilmer County,\r\nwith its sixty-nine blacks and almost 10,000 whites, the former paying\r\ntaxes on a few hundred acres of rocky hillsides, and their whole county\r\nproperty aggregating, by the most recent returns, only $957, while the\r\nlatter show taxable possessions valued at $728,000. In Rabun, Towns,\r\nFlannin and neighboring counties the situation shows much the same.\r\n\r\nThis brief study of typical counties may be closed with certain\r\ncomparative data from Fulton, which contains the state’s capital,\r\nAtlanta, a progressive and rapidly growing city distinctly of the “New\r\nSouth” type. Fulton was not laid out until 1853, hence is relatively\r\nyoung in the sisterhood of counties. Only about 2,000 slaves were set\r\nfree in this county. Compare the number with the 16,000 manumitted in\r\nChatham. But today there are more than 50,000 negroes in Fulton, and,\r\nalthough they own but a thousand acres of land in the county, yet the\r\naggregate value of their whole property is a bare trifle below one\r\nmillion dollars!\r\n\r\nTo extract the most important meanings from such figures is not\r\ndifficult. In connection with them several facts should be kept in mind,\r\nthe first of which is that the negro’s land-holdings in Georgia as well\r\nas in adjoining states are usually parceled out in very small individual\r\nlots. In a canvass of fifty-six typical counties of the state, the\r\nfollowing table was established to show the average size of the farm\r\nlots among negro proprietors:\r\n\r\n    CLASSIFIED SIZE         PER CENT. OF\r\n                            TOTAL OWNERS\r\n\r\n    Under 10 acres              30.50\r\n    10 or under 40 acres        27.00\r\n    40 or under 100 acres       21.85\r\n    100 or under 200 acres      12.80\r\n    200 or under 500 acres       6.89\r\n    500 acres or over             .93\r\n\r\nThe fifty-six counties canvassed represent the majority of negro holdings\r\nin the state, and the average here established may fairly be taken as\r\nthat of the state at large, or, indeed, of the agricultural South. The\r\nfact that a very large proportion of the farms are so limited in size\r\nas to amount only to gardens, or, in negro parlance, “patches,” augurs\r\nwell rather than ill, for it means many small proprietors instead of\r\nmerely a few large ones and the rest all renters or day laborers. Since\r\nout of 369,265 black people in the state ten years of age or over who\r\nare engaged in gainful occupations, almost two-thirds are employed in\r\nsome line of agricultural work, is it not well that the million acres\r\nowned by negroes should be distributed in small holdings? It is easy to\r\ndeduce from this the manifest decline of the metayer, or tenant system\r\nof farming. To be sure, these one-acre, or even ten-acre farms will\r\nseldom support the owner, though he may have the smallest family, or none\r\nat all. Such farms are largely instances of what may be called, in the\r\nGerman phrase, _Parzellenbetriebe_—that is, farms not large enough to\r\noccupy the labor of a family, but serving as sources of partial support\r\nto those with supplementary occupations. Yet, in many cases, these little\r\nplots of ground will grow to goodly farms within a few years. The same\r\nstory has been traced a thousand times in the past quarter of a century.\r\n\r\nIt will be remarked, also, that the negro’s town and city property\r\nis increasing greatly. In 1880 the assessed value of such property\r\nwas only $1,201,992, or 20 per cent. of their entire state property;\r\nwhile in 1902 it is $4,389,422, which is close to 29 per cent. of the\r\nstate’s aggregate. Thus, while agriculture gave the freedman his start\r\nin self-maintenance, and is still his chief dependence, yet paths of\r\nemployment and sources of revenue in cities are being discovered by him\r\nmore and more as the years go by and his education progresses.\r\n\r\nBefore passing to the close, another point is worthy of especial note,\r\ninteresting both the economist and the sociologist. In 1875 the assessed\r\nvalue of the household and kitchen furniture owned by all the negroes in\r\nthe state, then numbering between six and seven million souls, was only\r\n$21,186, or something like three cents’ worth to each individual. But in\r\n1902 the assessed value of the same class of property was $1,688,541, or\r\na trifle over the value of a dollar and a half to each colored man, woman\r\nand child in the state. Upon this phase of development and progress no\r\ncomment is needed.\r\n\r\nIn brief, then, the black people of Georgia paid taxes for 1902 on\r\n1,175,291 acres of land, and upon an entire property aggregating\r\n$15,188,069 in assessed value. This means, beyond the shadow of a doubt,\r\nthat the negroes of Georgia, or, broadly speaking, the South, are\r\naccumulating property and acquiring homes. And since the negro with a\r\nhome is almost sure to stand for law, order and civic faithfulness, it\r\nmeans, moreover, a reaching out toward higher standards of living, not\r\nmaterial living alone, but social life, mental and moral striving and\r\nachievements.\r\n\r\nComprehending the situation in its fulness, no man can deny that the race\r\nis actually _started_ on the road to better things than their past might\r\nhave indicated that they were capable of attaining.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _A Japanese Populist_\r\n\r\n                           BY THOMAS C. HUTTEN\r\n       _Author of “National Characteristics,” “The Farthest East”_\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo years ago a prominent Russian patriot admitted a misgiving that\r\nnothing but a miracle could shake the strongholds of Czarish despotism.\r\nIt does not impeach the correctness of his view that the miracle has been\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nA giant has entered the political arena; a new world power has risen from\r\nthe dust of a Buddhist serf-kennel, and it is about time to recognize the\r\nfact that the marvel of evolution has been effected by progress in the\r\ndirection of popular democracy.\r\n\r\nThe memorable vote of the daimios was a renunciation of class privileges.\r\nOf the forty amendments in the new constitution of the Japanese Empire,\r\ntwenty-six tend to reform the abuses of class legislation. The nation\r\ncontrols two-thirds of its mines. Stockholders of a telegraph monopoly\r\nhave been forced to accept a time limit of their contract. Six hundred\r\nand twenty miles of railroads are managed—and successfully managed—by\r\na national board of administration. The Government, in the name of the\r\nnation, builds its own warships and welds its own armor-plates, instead\r\nof farming out jobs to the highest briber. The Ways and Means Committee\r\nof 1901 reduced direct taxation almost on the exact plan of the system\r\nrecommended by the reformer Bakunin—reserving building lots in new cities\r\nand granting tenures from two to ten years at gradually increasing rates\r\nof rent.\r\n\r\nPopulist reforms have rendered the Government popular enough to make the\r\nnation invincible.\r\n\r\nAnd the world-wide need of those reforms has been repeatedly urged by\r\nJapanese travelers, and with the emphasis of strong personal conviction,\r\nespecially by a keen observer who visited Europe and North America in the\r\nsummer of 1903.\r\n\r\nProfessor Yashinto Korioky, agent of a Tokio reform club, explored\r\nthe United States without the assistance of the guides trained by our\r\nStar-spangled Uncle and with often remarkable results.\r\n\r\n“Surprises,” he says, “indeed, began before we had set foot on the soil\r\nof the great moral Republic. Above the sea mist and above the gathering\r\nclouds a fire gleamed like a meteor on the western horizon, and one of\r\nthe Chinese steerage passengers, venturing to inquire, ascertained that\r\nit was a statue of liberty, furnishing light to the world. The next\r\nmoment a sailor struck him between the eyes, and he admitted that he saw\r\nseveral starlike, luminous objects.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                         A TEST OF RIGHTEOUSNESS\r\n\r\n“The next morning,” he continues, “I got my traveling scrip, but was\r\ninformed that our boat was moored on the wharf of an island, where\r\nimmigrants are assorted according to the degree of their rectitude.\r\nSome pass the ordeal of scrutiny with ease, others with difficulty, for\r\nreasons which I was not always able to discern. I noticed, however, that\r\nthe Government has coined shekels of silver with inscriptions expressing\r\nsentiments of virtue—“In God we trust,” or similar words—and whenever\r\na traveler came provided with a goodly number of these tokens, his\r\nrighteousness seemed to be taken for granted.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                           PATERNAL SOLICITUDE\r\n\r\n“The investigations of the learned officials in some cases extended to\r\narticles of wearing apparel. One Canton trader had underlined his tunic\r\nwith eighty yards of fine silk, which, being discovered, were unwound and\r\nconfiscated to enforce a lesson of modesty in the matter of dress.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                         WORLDLINESS SUPPRESSED\r\n\r\n“He was, however, allowed to proceed, more fortunate than two of his\r\ncountrymen who had crossed the ocean for the first time, and were sent\r\nback at the expense of the Chinese contractors. Forty years ago these\r\nworldly toilers were admitted as freely as other foreigners; but it was\r\nnoticed that they worked sixteen hours a day and seven days in the week,\r\nthus disregarding the duty of providing leisure for spiritual exercises.\r\nAnd as their lack of repentance was, moreover, aggravated by the rapid\r\naccumulation of coin, it was finally decided to remove them for the\r\npromotion of their higher interests.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                          A SCHOOL OF PATIENCE\r\n\r\n“Animals that are most carefully excluded from the residence quarters\r\nof Japanese towns enjoy the freedom of many American cities.

After\r\ndark their clamor exceeds the vociferations of the East Indian jackals\r\nand robs thousands of sleep; but it is perhaps necessary that taxpaying\r\ncitizens should be trained in lessons of self-denial.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                          GOVERNMENT MAN-TRAPS\r\n\r\n“Knowing my reputation for veracity, be prompt, my brother, to intercede\r\nif the unregenerate of your neighborhood should question the following\r\nfacts: In the course of each year some 80,000,000 ox-loads of grain are\r\nmanufactured into a health-destroying poison; ... coal stoves, pretty as\r\nthe vases of Nagasaki, radiate warmth in winter; fans, operated by unseen\r\nforces, mitigate the heat of the summer season. Singers often warble with\r\nthe skill of the sirens. In the neighborhood of these seductive traps\r\nthe Government then posts its man-catchers and awaits results. It may\r\nseem incredible. But I have been informed that in Southern China monkeys\r\nare often captured by similar devices. When the poison begins to operate\r\nthey fall bewildered, and their awakening in a cage the next morning must\r\ntend to mitigate the frivolity of their disposition.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                          A THOUGHTFUL LANDLORD\r\n\r\n“The owner of the estate, we ascertained, was a timber merchant, as well\r\nas a pillar of virtue, and a large number of trees in the rear of the\r\nbuilding had recently been felled—probably to give the neighborhood a\r\nmore unobstructed view of heaven.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                        COMPENSATING LEGISLATION\r\n\r\n“Those stock gamblers, whose conspiracies had ruined thousands, were not\r\nmistaken in their expectation that the law would protect them against the\r\nrisk of a riot.

GROGAN\r\n       _Author of “The Dregs of Wrath,” “The King’s Sceptre,” “The\r\n                      Curse of the Fultons,” etc._\r\n\r\n\r\nI knew him at once. He was grayer, he was grimmer, he was more than ever\r\nlike a man of granite, hard and immobile, but I knew him. The sight of\r\nhim gravely unfolding his table napkin and covering his thin knees at\r\nluncheon in the little hotel set my thoughts back over ten years. I was\r\nthen a lad of sixteen. I had seen him constantly in the queer medieval\r\nstreets of Tsalburg, the little capital of Ertaria in the Balkans. Gray\r\nand grim, he was then the General Commandant of the army, the iron right\r\nhand of the Wolf King Peter XII. He was grayer and grimmer now, but\r\nundoubtedly the man. For a while I racked my memory for his name. It came\r\nsuddenly. General Hartzel! Undoubtedly the man.\r\n\r\nThe _Times_ supplied me with many conjectures. The senile old King\r\nwas dead; his heir, the Prince Paul, had lived his own life in Europe\r\nincognito, and the heir was not forthcoming. Rumor said he was in Paris.\r\n\r\nFor three days I watched the General. He knew no one at the hotel, he\r\nspoke to no one, but I saw him more than once in earnest conversation\r\nwith a young man about my own age, about my own height, about my own\r\ncolor, but—for the sake of my own vanity—alike in no other particular.\r\nThis was—the information was easily come by—the Comte de Troisétoilles,\r\na young Frenchman of position, now considerably taken with the beautiful\r\nsinger, Mlle. Aimée Bergeaux. That was the story noised about, and\r\nin proof thereof her little steam yacht rode in the harbor, he was\r\nconstantly with her, and a rumor was essential to the place. A companion,\r\nlarge, fat, unmistakably German and delightfully placid, cast a broad,\r\ncomplacent smile of propriety over the romance.\r\n\r\nMy General, I noted, snarled at the soprano for whose smiles princes\r\ncompeted. He was thorough, was my General, dear man of stone. Venus\r\nherself would have been baffled by him. But he spoke earnestly and\r\nvehemently to the Count, he who was so taciturn.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the third day I met my General on the south cliff by\r\nthe absurd little fort. There was a streak of smoke on the horizon. He\r\nwas shaking a fist at it, a violent, tempestuous fist.\r\n\r\nI have been a prey to sudden impulses all my life. I had maintained an\r\nEnglishman’s reserve for three days. I broke it suddenly on the cliff. I\r\naccosted the General in Ertarian.\r\n\r\n“You are disturbed, General Hartzel,” I said.\r\n\r\nHe wheeled round surprisingly. His astonishment grew when he saw me, the\r\nsilent companion of his luncheons.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur speaks Ertarian,” he said.\r\n\r\n“A little,” I answered modestly, yet with inward elation. To surprise a\r\nman of granite! Elation was surely pardonable.\r\n\r\n“As a native,” he continued. I bowed. “It is wonderful! Are you Ertarian?”\r\n\r\n“No,” I replied.\r\n\r\n“No,” he echoed with regret. “You are English. I saw you smoke a pipe.\r\nBut you know my real name? I am Captain Schneidlitz here.”\r\n\r\nI laughed. “Pardon me, General, I have been amusing myself with your\r\nsurprise. My father was British Minister at Tsalburg for many years. As a\r\nboy I spent my holidays there. Hence my accent.”\r\n\r\n“Your name is—?” he demanded.\r\n\r\n“Havensea,” I answered.\r\n\r\n“Then your father is ——?”\r\n\r\n“Exactly. I am now the head of my family. It is a large family, General.\r\nI have tens of aunts; my cousins are limitless. I pass an uneasy life\r\ntrying to evade them and my unnecessary title. It is difficult—please\r\nrespect my incognito as I respect yours, Captain Schneidlitz.”\r\n\r\n“You dislike your title?” he asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n“The coronet has given me a headache of the soul. You don’t know how\r\nterrible a British title is. It is a mere lever for opening bazaars, a\r\nfree ticket to everybody’s dinners.”\r\n\r\n“You object to yourself?” His question, the question of the man of\r\ngranite, was tremulous with excitement.\r\n\r\n“Pardon me,” I answered; “not to myself—but to the impossibility of being\r\nmyself. I am an English peer. I have not even the picturesqueness of\r\npoverty. You do not understand. In Ertaria they do not hold flower shows.\r\nI do not object to myself—I object to Lord Havensea.”\r\n\r\nThe General looked round anxiously. A wide-breeched soldier was walking\r\ntoward the fort; a white-stringed bonnet was going home. Seaward the\r\nstreak of smoke blackened the eye of the sun. The sight of that caused\r\nthe man of granite to swear solemnly in Ertarian—a language admitting a\r\nwide choice of expression to a man oppressed with a sense of wrong.\r\n\r\n“I will reply to your first question,” he said. He spoke in a low voice.\r\nHe was under some strong emotion. “I am disturbed. That little streak of\r\nsmoke dissolving out there represents my hopes dissipated, evaporated. My\r\nhopes are the hopes of Ertaria. We are a small country, but we are proud.”\r\n\r\n“A country’s pride invariably compensates for lack of acres.”\r\n\r\n“It is a jest to you,” he said sadly. I had expected him to be angry at\r\nmy flippant remark. The sadness of his voice slipped past my guard. Here\r\nat last I had found a man who could feel.\r\n\r\n“Your pardon, General,” I said more soberly than I had previously spoken.\r\n“The pride of Ertaria I know rests upon an unstained national honor.”\r\n\r\n“If you believed that!” he cried.\r\n\r\n“I do,” I answered stoutly. “Frankly, you are all absurd, but it is\r\na glorious absurdity. Small, hemmed in by enemies, you have kept an\r\nindependence, noble and untainted, for seven hundred years.”\r\n\r\n“You believe it! Why not?” he cried excitedly. “Your father, the dear\r\nLord Havensea, loved us. He was our friend. His representations at St.\r\nJames’s saved us once. You inherited his love. We are in peril now.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said I, “the lost heir.”\r\n\r\n“He is out there under that streak of smoke.”\r\n\r\n“He was the Comte de Troisétoilles?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. The French singer is Russian. You understand?”\r\n\r\n“Kidnapped! Scratch a French soprano and you will find a Russian. My\r\nGeneral!” I was indeed sorry for him. He was honest, was this man of\r\ngranite. He loved his country. And Prince Paul—“Royal robes should cover\r\nmen, not flattered fools.”\r\n\r\n“You understand. The great game is lost. I love Ertaria as I love nothing\r\nelse. I would pour out my blood willingly for her. That would be nothing.\r\nI have been the guardian of her honor. That was everything. And now the\r\nhand of the greedy Bear is stretched out for it. And it is lost. At least\r\nfive minutes ago I said it was lost. But now you—you can save it—the\r\ngreat game, the honor of Ertaria, the independence, the life-blood!”\r\n\r\n“I! My dear General, I am a tired English peer recovering from a surfeit\r\nof municipal and parochial addresses.”\r\n\r\n“You—only you. You are an Englishman, you speak Ertarian, you resemble\r\nthe Prince Paul somewhat; he is unknown in Ertaria. You are out of love\r\nwith your own identity; you long for something else, for some other\r\nlife——”\r\n\r\n“My dear General, speak out the whole of your madness.”\r\n\r\n“Come, Lord Havensea, and hold the throne!”\r\n\r\nI was staggered, astounded. For a moment I watched the smoke becoming\r\nthinner and thinner. Suddenly it seemed to pop out. It was of course a\r\ntrick of the imagination.\r\n\r\n“You are an Englishman—therefore you have courage.”\r\n\r\nIt was transcendent flattery. A throne!\r\n\r\n“It is madness, my General,” I said. His eyes sparkled.\r\n\r\n“It is the madness we love,” he said softly. “And it is for the country,\r\nmy country. The poor fool will come back. Don’t let it be too late. Keep\r\nthe throne for him—and for us, for the Ertarian children unborn that they\r\nbe not born the slaves of the Muscovite. You have read the history of\r\nPoland?”\r\n\r\n“It is folly, but—” I commenced.\r\n\r\n“The train starts tonight, my Prince, at eleven. The West Station. I will\r\nmake all things ready.” The General looked out at the winking sun. The\r\nreal Prince was kidnapped, but in his dire need Fate had tossed him a\r\npseudo one.\r\n\r\nIt was the wildest of folly, of course, but once seriously embarked upon,\r\nit was remarkable how smoothly it ran. I returned to the hotel, paid my\r\nbill, sent my valet home to England, and met the General at the station.\r\nI entered the first-class compartment a private English gentleman—even\r\nmy poor little title left in the custody of my lawyers in Ely Place—and\r\nacross the Ertarian frontier I stepped out Paul V.\r\n\r\nWe alighted at a small station. There were three or four anxious-looking\r\nmen on its slender platform. They were dressed in the frock coat of\r\nceremony. One man only was conspicuous in a gorgeous uniform. It reminded\r\nme of my own Havensea livery. I was preparing to be royally gracious\r\nto him when Hartzel whispered he was the station-master. It was a\r\nbrilliant morning; the sun lay on the white caps of the mountain pass\r\nand glistened; big butterflies painted the field; the air was clear,\r\nrarified. I was in excellent spirits.\r\n\r\nThe General watched the absurd little engine puff its way onward. Then he\r\nturned to me, took off his hat, knelt and kissed my hand. The spectacle\r\nof my man of granite kneeling, his honest, ugly face figured by emotion,\r\nstruck me strangely.\r\n\r\n“To my God, my Country and my King are my life and my honor dedicated,”\r\nhe said, the quaint old formula of allegiance in Ertaria. The frock\r\ncoats went through the same performance. It lacked the earnestness of\r\nthe General and had a note of anxiety. They looked as though they\r\nwere expecting a troop of Cossacks over the edge of the pass and were\r\nnervous. But the ceremony marked a step in the game. Until then I was\r\nin a transition state. I was no longer Lord Havensea, but I had not yet\r\nbecome King until I had stepped out of my uncomfortable compartment into\r\na kingdom.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” I said in their own picturesque tongue, “you are the first\r\nof my subjects to welcome me. Not as King will I speak to you now, but as\r\na fellow-worker, for my heart also is dedicated to God and Ertaria.”\r\n\r\nThat struck some spark into their dull faces.\r\n\r\n“Seven centuries of liberty are in our hands,” said I. “The dead fathers\r\nof Ertaria have given us this heritage. It is that which I come to\r\npreserve—in peace if God wills, but if not, the history of Ertaria tells\r\nus how to act.”\r\n\r\nBombast if you will, but it brought life, valor, strength into their\r\nfaces.\r\n\r\nAs for the man of granite, his eyes flashed. Ten minutes more and we were\r\ngalloping up the white ribbon of a road toward Tsalburg, embarked upon as\r\nmad a mission as was ever enacted in this Balkan basin of mad missions.\r\nOur frock-coated friends remained behind. I kissed each on his scrubby\r\ncheek, and told him to guard our frontier. They swore to this with tears\r\nin their eyes.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said I, “we have played the first act of the farce.”\r\n\r\n“You have done well,” my mentor replied. “But this is no farce. It is a\r\nperilous game to play.”\r\n\r\n“You did not tell me so before, General. A spice of danger gives it a\r\nzest.”\r\n\r\n“You speak like a soldier.”\r\n\r\n“I was a soldier—that was before I became a peer and was a personage.\r\nShall I pass muster? Will they perceive I am no King? Will the people be\r\nwith me?”\r\n\r\n“Keep a brave heart and that will carry you through. The Russian\r\nMinister, of course, will know you are an impostor.”\r\n\r\n“The deuce he will!”\r\n\r\n“You must bluff him.”\r\n\r\n“And four weeks ago I received the freedom of an English town from a\r\nsuccessful grocer! Hartzel, my blood races! Here are romance, adventure!\r\nI am your debtor for life!”\r\n\r\n“That debt may be liquidated at any moment,” he said grimly. For a minute\r\nhis old face softened, and then it was as hard as ever. I knew that some\r\ntouch of remorse had stabbed him. The game was nothing to me; he was\r\nstaking my life for a cause in which I had no concern. Then came the\r\nthought of his country. No life mattered then.\r\n\r\nThat night we lay in a small town, and I was shown secretly to a few of\r\nthe town’s chief men; and the next night we slept in the General’s house\r\nat Tsalburg. The rumor of my coming circulated furiously. At eleven\r\no’clock, when I was preparing to rest, tired with my long journey, a\r\nmob assembled in the square outside and sang the national anthem for an\r\nhour or so. Hartzel harangued them from the balcony. I was fatigued. I\r\ncould not be disturbed, but on the morrow their King would meet them.\r\nThat was the purport of his speech. The national anthem broke out again,\r\nand presently, with the poetical inspiration of the nation, they sang a\r\nlegendary serenade.\r\n\r\nHartzel came to my room and sat on the edge of my bed. I was nearly dead\r\nwith fatigue, but he was inexorable.\r\n\r\n“Tomorrow will see the crucial test of our scheme, so you must listen.\r\nThere are two factions in Ertaria. In the late King’s reign I kept the\r\nTertourgkis in abeyance.”\r\n\r\n“The Tertourgkis!” I cried, memory stirring me. “They had some feud with\r\nthe reigning family and—and there was a daughter.”\r\n\r\n“You remember?” he said. “Prince Tertourgki is an old man. His wealth and\r\nhis lands go to this daughter, his only child. She is very beautiful.”\r\n\r\n“She was a beautiful child, dark and serene as night.”\r\n\r\n“The Prince has claims to the throne. He is the descendant of the\r\nTertourgkis, who reigned in the fifteenth century. They were despots, and\r\na revolution set the Borros on the throne. The Prince has never abrogated\r\nhis claim. There is a second cousin——”\r\n\r\n“My General, the rest is easy to decipher. The second cousin has\r\naspirations for the hand of the Princess Marie; he is the puppet of the\r\nRussians; the Tertourgkis’ influence is great; we fear the loyalty of the\r\narmy; we must deal quickly with the second cousin.”\r\n\r\n“You are quick at guessing,” the General answered slowly. “You know——”\r\n\r\n“On my word, nothing—nothing but the name of the Princess Marie. When\r\nthe world was younger, General, there was a large garden and a young\r\nschoolboy—he thought himself a man—and a little child and flowers.\r\nTogether they made a happy time. The sun was always shining. The little\r\nchild worshiped the big schoolboy—and he graciously permitted it.”\r\n\r\n“Your father’s house! Ah, well, you know something, but not all. As the\r\nKing lay dying I—I arranged a marriage between the Princess Marie and the\r\nabsent Paul.”\r\n\r\nI sat up in bed.\r\n\r\n“The Prince Paul!” I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“The Prince Paul,” he assented stolidly. “He consented. The Prince looked\r\nkindly upon it; the Princess would not give a definite answer. When the\r\nPrince arrived, she said, she would give him her answer personally.”\r\n\r\n“This is your arrangement?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“It was a diplomatic stroke,” he said.\r\n\r\n“You took an unwarrantable liberty,” I cried warmly. “Why was I not told\r\nof this before?”\r\n\r\n“Because you would not have come.”\r\n\r\n“And now?”\r\n\r\n“Now it is different. You are caught in the toils.”\r\n\r\n“It is an unwarrantable liberty! You have engaged me matrimonially\r\nwithout any reference to my feelings.”\r\n\r\n“I have engaged Prince Paul.”\r\n\r\n“Who am I?”\r\n\r\n“Who you are for the present. My dear Havensea, you do not consider my\r\nposition.”\r\n\r\n“You have had precious little consideration for mine!”\r\n\r\n“It is not yours. You are an actor playing a role. In a short while you\r\nwill make a graceful bow and exit.”\r\n\r\n“I am not at all sure that it will be graceful.”\r\n\r\n“As you will. That does not matter at all. You play a part for a little\r\nwhile. They will not dare to keep the real Prince a prisoner for long.”\r\n\r\n“I am to cheat this girl?”\r\n\r\n“What does it matter? It is a royal alliance—there are no considerations\r\nbut that of policy. I do not propose to marry you to her.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks. That is considerate.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Havensea, you are perturbed. The Princess is to marry the Crown.\r\nShe is piqued at the long delay of the Prince. There is no question of\r\nsentiment.”\r\n\r\n“Suppose there were?”\r\n\r\nHe looked at me curiously for a moment.\r\n\r\n“That is a proposition I will not entertain,” he answered.\r\n\r\n“I will not do it!” I cried angrily.\r\n\r\n“You will,” he replied quietly. “You have already impersonated the King.\r\nHave you considered the consequences? I say nothing about you. You are\r\na brave man. But you have already compromised many honest men—and one\r\ndishonest old man. We are only half civilized. That is part of our\r\ncharm—at least to you. The people would be very angry. You would be\r\nkilled!”\r\n\r\n“By Jove, you are a pleasant philosopher!”\r\n\r\n“To a brave man that may mean little—life is a mere stake. But the honest\r\nmen and the dishonest old man would die also. You could not have my death\r\nupon your conscience!”\r\n\r\n“You deserve it, my General; you deserve it, on my honor!”\r\n\r\n“Possibly.” He waved it aside resolutely as a matter of small\r\nconsequence. “There is also Ertaria. Shall we grant that the Princess\r\nmay not be happy? Then there is one woman unhappy and a nation free.\r\nHavensea, you do not understand the stake for which we play. It is not a\r\ncrown, nor a woman’s heart, but a nation’s freedom. The heel of Russia\r\nbruises the very souls of men. Russia knouts a man’s soul. Where is\r\nPoland today? It is a great game to save a nation from that curse.”\r\n\r\nThe man of granite spoke soberly. There was no impassioned appeal. He\r\nspoke of facts. As a boy I knew something of this terror of Russia. This\r\nrugged, hard man was a hero. He played his life not for advancement, but\r\nfor the good of his country. My heart warmed to him. And, as he said,\r\nthere was also Ertaria.\r\n\r\n“I shall go through with it, General,” I said at length. Our hands closed\r\non that; in the winking light of a candle I saw his eyes glitter. He did\r\nnot speak for a full minute. Then he muttered in a low voice, “If you\r\nwere only a Borro!”\r\n\r\n“It would have been fatiguing,” I said. “I should have quarreled with\r\nyou. There is not room on the throne for two men.”\r\n\r\nHe laughed abruptly at that.\r\n\r\nThe next morning General Hartzel aroused me at an unearthly hour. He made\r\nme dress in a steel-corseleted uniform. It was exceedingly gorgeous and\r\nstiff with gold lace.\r\n\r\n“It is the uniform of the Colonel of the Royal Guards,” he told me.\r\n\r\n“Promotion is rapid in Ertaria,” I said. “I was an unconsidered subaltern\r\nin our Blues.”\r\n\r\n“The army is reviewed today on the Plain of Liberty,” he said, “by Prince\r\nTertourgki. He is regent during your absence.”\r\n\r\n“And the second cousin?”\r\n\r\n“Is his aide-de-camp—Prince Otho. The Russian Minister will be there.”\r\n\r\n“And his august name?” I demanded.\r\n\r\n“Baron Ivaniski.”\r\n\r\n“My dear General!” I cried. “There is a saying, ‘The luck of the\r\nHavenseas.’ The luck holds good. The Russian Bear shall dance, I promise\r\nyou!”\r\n\r\n“What does Your Majesty mean?”\r\n\r\n“His Majesty knows a story, General, a pretty, ornate and most scandalous\r\nstory. Ivaniski was an attaché at Berlin when my uncle was Ambassador. It\r\nwill be the only good turn Uncle John has ever done me.”\r\n\r\nFor two mortal hours after a particularly disappointing breakfast—the\r\nGeneral betrayed but an indifferent regard to cuisine—I was gracious to\r\nthe peculiarly uninteresting big men of Tsalburg. I signed innumerable\r\npapers, and at a hint from the General kissed those worthy of the honor.\r\nIt afforded them far more satisfaction than it did me.\r\n\r\nAt noon I mounted a black charger, and, accompanied only by the\r\nGeneral, set out for the Plain of Liberty. Hartzel had misled—to use a\r\neuphemism—the populace as to my movements, so that it was merely at odd\r\nwhiles that I was called upon to acknowledge shouts of greeting.\r\n\r\nThe Plain of Liberty is a tableland upon the hill that rises above the\r\ntown. From it Tsalburg can be seen spread out in picturesque confusion.\r\nIt is a big plain, and its name is derived from the presence in its\r\ncentre of a huge column surmounted by a figure of Liberty. On the base\r\nof this column are inscribed the names of the more or less traditional\r\nheroes who are popularly supposed to have engineered the independence of\r\nthe country. This column has become a subject of sentimental worship with\r\nthe nation.\r\n\r\nOn this plain were assembled the populace of Tsalburg to witness the\r\nreview of the major part of the troops of the country, some fifteen\r\nthousand. Prince Tertourgki had selected a place near the column as a\r\nsaluting base, and the troops, when we arrived, were drawn up in review\r\norder. The column stood, as it were, a huge, gray sentinel between the\r\nPrince and the troops.\r\n\r\n“Some of the officers I could trust expect you!” the General cried.\r\n“Spur on to the troops. Now is our crisis. The Baron has tampered with\r\nsome of the regiments, but to what extent I cannot say. If the troops\r\nreceive you Ertaria is saved.”\r\n\r\n“Your true gambler risks all on a single throw!” I shouted, clapping\r\nspurs into my charger. It was a glorious gallop. My blood raced in my\r\nveins. My horse was maddened by the touch of the spur. I thundered on\r\ndown the level turf. I saw the stir of surprise in the populace. I caught\r\na waver of ranks as the troops craned forward to see me come. Then a\r\nflash of inspiration came to me. As I raced by the column I suddenly\r\ndrew rein, flinging my horse back on his haunches. For a moment he lay\r\ncrouched backward, and in that moment I had raised my sword in salute of\r\nthe column. Then the charger leaped forward, and I rode to the front of\r\nthe troops.\r\n\r\nSuch a shout greeted me as I have never heard before. It roared about my\r\nears like thunder. “Long live the King!” they cried, and the populace\r\ntook up the words, “Long live the King!”\r\n\r\nI raised my hand and there was silence.\r\n\r\n“Comrades,” I shouted, “we all alike serve under Liberty. The statue of\r\nour dead heroes watches over King and people.” Again the air was rent.\r\n\r\nI turned. General Hartzel, following me, had just cantered up. On his\r\ngrim, granite face was a smile like wintry sunshine.\r\n\r\n“General Hartzel,” I cried, “you will march the troops past in review\r\norder!” Then I cantered over to the saluting base. I was King!\r\n\r\nAn old man in uniform was fidgeting about on a gray horse. At his side\r\nwas a young officer, dark, almost swarthy, whispering eagerly. In a\r\nlandau at the back sat a frock-coated gentleman with an order in his\r\nbuttonhole. He had the broadness between the eyes of the Tartar. With him\r\nwas the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. Out of her big black eyes\r\nshone the light of admiration. In a mist I saw again the small child in\r\nthe garden, her wondering worship and the big English schoolboy.\r\n\r\n“Prince,” I cried, “will you do me the honor of taking the salute?”\r\nI spoke to him so as to force an answer. The unexpected compliment\r\nflustered him.\r\n\r\n“Your Majesty,” he faltered, “my usefulness is over.”\r\n\r\n“No,” I replied, engineering my restive charger to the discomfiture of\r\nthe second cousin, “we will work together for Ertaria, Prince.” I held\r\nout my hand, and in a moment the white-haired old fellow was off his\r\nhorse and kneeling, kissing my hand. How the populace roared aloud their\r\npleasure! The bands crashed out the national anthem, ladies fluttered\r\ntheir scarfs, a whole forest of hats waved in the air. I was King, and\r\napparently popular. It was an exhilarating feeling. I thought of the real\r\nPaul shut up in a satinwood cabin on board a kicking little steam yacht,\r\nand smiled.\r\n\r\nThe Prince and I took the salute; he reined in to a respectful distance.\r\nAfterward I was conducted to the landau. The Prince stayed a moment to\r\nspeak to the second cousin. I rode up alone and dismounted.\r\n\r\n“Have you no welcome for the King, Princess Marie?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“You know me? My father told you?” Her voice was serene, low, like silver\r\nbells on a summer evening.\r\n\r\n“No. The Prince has said nothing. But I knew that the Princess Marie was\r\nthe most beautiful woman in Ertaria.” She smiled at me. I met her smiling\r\neyes. It was then I regretted that I was merely playing a part. The small\r\nchild had grown into a wondrously beautiful woman. I know that from the\r\nmoment my eyes met hers in that long look I loved her. Hers were eloquent\r\nalso, so eloquent that she veiled them quickly with long, thick, black,\r\ncurling lashes, and the rich color mounted to her cheek.\r\n\r\n“But Your Majesty,” the Russian’s lips curled in a sneer, “has seen the\r\nPrincess’s photograph.”\r\n\r\n“One has no conception of sunlight from observation of the moon, Baron,”\r\nI answered.\r\n\r\n“And you are really the King, Paul V.” His voice was challenging, his\r\neyes were gleaming with anger. The elaborate and desperate project of\r\nkidnapping the Prince had failed at the very moment of its success. In\r\nhis pocket, I thought, were the particulars of Paul’s involuntary voyage,\r\nand yet here was a king to thwart all his plans.\r\n\r\n“And you are really the Baron Ivaniski—of Berlin?” He grew white to the\r\nlips at the concealed threat in my voice.\r\n\r\n“Of Berlin?” he faltered. “I have no connection with Berlin.”\r\n\r\n“Your memory is short, Baron. In November of ’84 you were surely in\r\nBerlin. I believe, if I tried, I could persuade you of that. Lord\r\nDerwenthurst was a friend of mine.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes, I had forgotten,” he muttered. I could have laughed at him, he\r\nhad become so craven and so cringing. Uncle John had told me of the Baron\r\nand his gambling debts, and his attempt to sell a Russian secret to us.\r\nUncle John was too honest for a diplomat. He refused, and extracted from\r\nthe young attaché a signed declaration of his treason. The alternative\r\nwas that of forwarding the proposal to the Russian Ambassador.\r\n\r\nRiding to the palace with my granite General, he expressed approval of my\r\nday’s work.\r\n\r\n“Ah, General,” said I, “the public enthusiasm is stimulating. Not all the\r\nschool children of my native town, bribed by oranges and buns, can shout\r\nlike your honest people.”\r\n\r\n“And the Princess?” he asked anxiously.\r\n\r\n“And the Princess is divine.”\r\n\r\nA week passed in a whirl of popular excitement. No one guessed; the\r\nRussian dared not speak openly. In any case I hardly think Russia\r\nwould have avowed her kidnapping of the Prince. As it was, the Baron\r\nhad too great a fear of the document he believed I held. On the second\r\nday the Princess gave me her answer. We were betrothed. Public joy\r\nexpressed itself in gala nights at the Opera, in fireworks, in torchlight\r\nprocessions. And for me all the zest of the game I was playing departed.\r\nAs I listened to Marie, as I learned from her own lips that she loved\r\nme, I realized bitterly the part I was playing. Not all the General’s\r\nsophistries could disguise it from me. I was cheating her. And her trust\r\nwas perfect. I writhed under her praise, I was tortured by the possession\r\nof her love, a possession which, come by honestly, I would have treasured\r\nbeyond all else.\r\n\r\nOn the eighth day, the evening of the gala ball, my granite General came\r\nto my private chamber.\r\n\r\n“The _Coquette_ entered Trieste last night,” he said harshly. I started.\r\n_Coquette_ was the name of the soprano’s yacht.\r\n\r\n“Well?” I replied. We stared at each other. General Hartzel had been\r\ngrowing brusk and ill-humored with me. I think he guessed at the romance.\r\n\r\n“The King will be here tomorrow night.”\r\n\r\n“Suppose I answer that by saying the King is here?”\r\n\r\n“You will not do that. Your honor is engaged.”\r\n\r\n“You have been teaching me to do without honor.”\r\n\r\n“I must tell her tonight.”\r\n\r\nI rose. “You will not. I will tell her.”\r\n\r\n“You will seek to dissuade her!”\r\n\r\n“I will tell her. It is my right, Hartzel.”\r\n\r\n“You promise——?”\r\n\r\n“I promise nothing. Man, do you think I will slink out of this like a\r\nwhipped cur? I have cheated. I will confess.”\r\n\r\nAfter the first ceremonial reception I slipped into the dark garden. My\r\nbrain was hot. I wanted to feel the soft coolness of the night. In an\r\navenue I stumbled upon the Prince Otho and the Russian Baron. They barred\r\nmy way.\r\n\r\n“Impostor!” cried the Prince. The news had leaked out. The Russian knew\r\nand had told his friend.\r\n\r\nI took off my glove and struck him in the face.\r\n\r\n“After the fourth waltz,” I said. “There is a moon. In the walled garden.\r\nAnd, gentlemen, whatever you may know, keep silence. Berlin will speak if\r\nyou do.”\r\n\r\nI sought Hartzel. He was not difficult to find. He was dogging my steps\r\nlike a spy. I told him of my meeting in the garden, and asked him to be\r\nmy second.\r\n\r\n“He is a good swordsman,” he said. I think he was sorry.\r\n\r\n“Then I sincerely hope the real Paul won’t miss his train. To have the\r\nthrone vacant again would be annoying.”\r\n\r\n“And you?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“My dear General,” I said, with a smile, “when a man is giving up a pearl\r\nof infinite value he does not care much for the tarnished gold of his own\r\nlife.”\r\n\r\nThe fourth waltz I danced with the Princess Marie.\r\n\r\n“I wish to speak to you soberly, seriously, sedately, Marie. May I? Come\r\nto the little conservatory and sit out the thirteenth.”\r\n\r\n“It is an unlucky number.”\r\n\r\n“No number is unlucky that gives me your presence,” I said lightly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the moonlight we stripped to our shirts. It was nearly as light as day.\r\n\r\n“This is a mistake,” my granite General said. He was thinking of the risk\r\nto his scheme and the ease with which both men could have been arrested.\r\n\r\n“No, General. This may be reparation,” I answered.\r\n\r\nPrince Otho was an excellent swordsman. That I knew at once. His wrist\r\nwas supple and strong as steel. We engaged and fought slowly, cautiously.\r\nHe had a dangerous, wicked riposte which I guarded twice, more by luck\r\nthan by skill. Undoubtedly he was my master. I smiled grimly at this. I\r\nwas sorry, because I wished to speak to Marie. And yet, perhaps, this\r\nwas a better way. Ah, a scratch! I had turned too late, and the sting in\r\nmy shoulder told me I was hit.\r\n\r\n“He is hit! It is enough!” cried General Hartzel.\r\n\r\n“A mere scratch!” I answered hotly, and we engaged again. It was evident\r\nthe Prince was waiting for an opening to kill. Two opportunities for\r\nserious wounds he passed. Then suddenly he made a quick lunge over my\r\nguard. I stepped back quickly; he could not recover his guard; he fell\r\nback. Hartzel leaned over him.\r\n\r\n“That ends it,” he said complacently. “Four weeks, at least, in bed. This\r\nis an accident, Baron.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe thirteenth dance. The lights were very low. There was the heavy,\r\nthick scent of gardenias. The Chinese lanterns swayed curiously. When I\r\npulled myself together they were still. The wound pricked unpleasantly.\r\n\r\nMarie came.\r\n\r\n“This is most unorthodox, Your Majesty,” she said mockingly. “Everyone is\r\nasking for you.”\r\n\r\n“Will you sit down, dear?” I spoke very slowly. In truth the pain in my\r\narm was like a red-hot steel needle. She sobered quickly. I could not see\r\nvery well. I think she went white. She sat down meekly. I could see her\r\nbig eyes, only her eyes.\r\n\r\n“Paul!” she breathed.\r\n\r\n“I am not Paul,” I said. “I am not King. I am only the King’s image, a\r\npoor counterfeit.”\r\n\r\n“Paul!” she said again. Then she checked herself.\r\n\r\n“He will be here tomorrow. My period of usefulness will be over. He—he\r\nwas kidnapped. I came—because I was bored, because there was some chance\r\nof adventure, because an old man pleaded for his country. Now it is all\r\nover—the King comes, the King’s image is wanted no longer.”\r\n\r\n“Paul, I want you,” she said in a low voice.\r\n\r\n“I am not Paul. And—and, Marie, there is duty! A nation may groan under\r\nthe tyranny of Russia unless—You understand, Marie. Our lives cannot\r\nalways be ministers to our desires. We—we are caught in the toils; we\r\ncan only obey, we can only do our duty, trusting that somehow it will be\r\nfound good.”\r\n\r\n“For us?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“For your people.”\r\n\r\n“You say that that is my duty, Paul?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“And you love me?”\r\n\r\n“And I love you,” I answered. The lanterns were swinging madly now. Over\r\ntheir light was a new mist growing, growing. I bit my lip—but the throb\r\nof the wound was agony.\r\n\r\n“I believe you, dear,” she said simply. “It—it seems hard that—that so\r\nmuch should rest upon one poor girl. I think I know what—you mean. The\r\npeople shall be happy though the Queen’s heart break.” She rose and came\r\ntoward me. She caught me by my wounded shoulder and kissed me. And with\r\nall the agony of it that kiss I hold in my heart always as a dear memory.\r\n\r\nWhen she went the lanterns whirled, the mist shut down on my eyes, and I\r\nfell. General Hartzel found me.\r\n\r\nThe next morning early, recovered of my swoon, I rode out of Tsalburg.\r\nGeneral Hartzel rode with me a little way.\r\n\r\n“If you had only been the real King,” he said, with more feeling than I\r\nthought possible, “and not——”\r\n\r\n“And not the King’s image,” I filled in. “It is a pity when the clay\r\nimage has a living heart.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             _The Story of a Suppressed Populist Newspaper_\r\n\r\n                          BY THOMAS H. TIBBLES\r\n              _People’s Party Candidate for Vice-President_\r\n\r\n\r\nAt one time there were fifteen hundred weekly papers advocating the\r\nprinciples of the Omaha platform. Some of them had large plants, some\r\nonly a few cases of type and a Washington press, but all were actuated\r\nby one purpose—to make conditions easier for those who toiled on farms,\r\nin shops, factories, mines and mills. Among those still fighting up to\r\nthe first of April of this year was the _Nebraska Independent_. Many\r\nsuch papers were crushed by various devices, chief among which was that\r\nthe great advertisers of the land, all being allied with Wall Street,\r\nrefused to give them any business. Numerous instances could be cited\r\nwhere Populist papers were refused advertisements given to plutocratic\r\npapers not having one-tenth the circulation, and paid for at a higher\r\nrate than the proprietors of the Populist papers would have taken. In\r\nthe files of the _Nebraska Independent_ may be found scores of letters\r\nfrom advertising agents, who had been solicited for business, saying:\r\n“If you will make your paper an exclusively agricultural journal we will\r\nbe glad to give you a good line of business, but we cannot patronize it\r\nas long as it advocates Populism.” Every reform editor has had the same\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nThirteen years ago the agricultural papers everywhere were publishing\r\narticles defending Populist principles. Then all at once such articles\r\nwere seen in their pages no more, and immediately the papers were\r\nflooded with high-priced advertising. The religious press was caught in\r\nthe same trap. It is strange that the devout readers of those papers\r\nnever once had their suspicions aroused when they saw so many display\r\nadvertisements of trusts, banks and promotion schemes in their modest\r\nlittle religious journals. Notwithstanding all such schemes, the\r\n_Nebraska Independent_ lived and its circulation gradually extended into\r\nevery state and territory. It became evident that to get rid of it other\r\ntactics would have to be employed. To destroy the paper was not the\r\nobjective. It was to destroy the People’s Party. With the _Independent_\r\nin hostile hands the political fortifications built up by it in Nebraska\r\nand other states would be deserted and the Bryan, Belmont, Sheehan and\r\nTom Taggart Democratic Party could walk in and take possession.\r\n\r\nThe main battle was fought in the Populist state convention August 10,\r\n1904. The proposition to force a fusion with the Democrats under the lead\r\nof the most disreputable end of Wall Street, fresh from its victory in\r\nSt. Louis, on the face of it was most absurd. But the doing of absurd\r\nthings never ruffles the placid countenance of Mr. Bryan. The idea that\r\nthere could be any real opposition to his imperial will in Nebraska,\r\naside from the Republican Party, never seemed to enter his mind.\r\nHeretofore when Mr. Bryan entered a Democratic or Populist convention,\r\nthe Fusion Populists and Democrats immediately bowed and worshiped. The\r\nonly thing that convention had to do was to find out what Mr. Bryan\r\nwished and then proceed to do it with all possible haste. It became\r\nevident that this convention would have to be handled differently. Mr.\r\nBryan all the winter, spring and summer had been denouncing Judge Parker\r\nas a “dishonest candidate, running on a dishonest platform,” and then he\r\nhad come home from St. Louis, sat down at his desk and the first words\r\nthat he wrote were: “I shall vote for Parker and Davis.” The Populists\r\nremembered how for eight years he had been coming to their conventions,\r\nand in his sweet and winning way telling them how noble they were to\r\nput principle above party and vote for men of another party if they\r\nthought they could advance reform by so doing. Many of them, who had\r\nalways supported Mr. Bryan since he first appeared on the battlefields\r\nof politics, thought that the time had come when he should practice what\r\nhe preached. Mr. Bryan realized that there was trouble ahead, but it was\r\nthought if the _Nebraska Independent_ would support the Bryan plan that\r\na fusion legislature could be elected that would send Mr. Bryan to the\r\nUnited States Senate.\r\n\r\nThe editor of the _Independent_ was obstreperous. He had had enough of\r\nfusion with a party half of which was more disreputably plutocratic than\r\nthe Republican Party, and whose “irrevocable” rules were so rigid that\r\nthey required a man, upon a vote of a convention, to come out boldly\r\nbefore the people and advocate a policy he had denounced by pen and\r\nvoice for eight years. All sorts of schemes were devised to bring this\r\nobstreperous editor into subjection to the imperial will of Mr. Bryan.\r\nThe first was to send all the leading men of the state, from the Chief\r\nJustice down, to use persuasion. That failed. Then Mr. Bryan’s personal\r\ndaily organ in the state tried a new deal. It poured out on Mr. Tibbles\r\nthe most fulsome flattery day after day. It said if he would only say\r\n“fusion” every Populist in the state would obey his command. When all\r\nthat failed Mr. Bryan came himself. The proposition that he made was\r\nthat a fusion electoral ticket be put in the field composed of four\r\nPopulists and four Democrats, Mr. Bryan saying that, “in the event of\r\ntheir election, each party could count the full vote as its own.” The\r\nproposition was instantly rejected. Others followed. Mr. Bryan came to\r\nthe _Independent_ editorial-room four different times, using all his\r\neloquence and persuasive powers to get the editor to consent to and\r\nadvocate a fusion with a party that had nominated Parker, and whose\r\ncampaign was put into the hands of the most disreputable gang that ever\r\nsought Wall Street favor.\r\n\r\nMr. Bryan gave orders that everything visible, clear to the political\r\nhorizon, and other things invisible lying behind the floating clouds,\r\nshould be offered to the Populist convention providing that the Populists\r\nwould fuse. The battle was fought out on the convention floor. Many\r\nDemocrats had secured seats as delegates. One Democrat came over from\r\nhis own convention and answered to the call of Thurston County in the\r\nPopulist convention which had no delegates present, and voted the fifteen\r\nvotes that county was entitled to every time for fusion. Out of the\r\nhell-broth brewed in that all-night session there floated upon the fusion\r\nscum Bryan, Belmont, Sheehan, Tom Taggart and, remember this last name,\r\nGeorge W. Berge.\r\n\r\nNearly the whole state ticket was given to the Populists—only three\r\nunimportant offices being conceded to the Democrats, and Berge—George\r\nWashington Berge—captured the prize infamy, the fusion nomination\r\nfor Governor. Bryan would allow no other name to be mentioned in the\r\nDemocratic convention, although there were two or three Democrats there\r\nwho had spent time and much money during the previous eight years\r\nfighting Bryan’s battles for him, and who had expressed a desire to\r\nreceive a complimentary vote for that office. When Bryan speaks the\r\n_Nebraska Democrat_ turns pale.\r\n\r\nThe _Independent_ was still a thorn in the side of these fusionists.\r\nThe editor openly declared that he never would vote for or support a\r\nBelmont-Bryan-Parker Democrat. Then it was that fusion itch for office\r\nand Bryan diplomacy joined forces to destroy the _Independent_. The\r\nplutocratic Republican attacks upon it had been of no avail, and week\r\nafter week it had proclaimed the doctrines of the People’s Party for ten\r\nyears. In an open fight against awful odds it had fought battle after\r\nbattle, sometimes victorious and sometimes defeated, but it fought on. It\r\ntook fusion treason, it took the work of men who constantly proclaimed\r\nthemselves Populists, who insisted upon attending Populist conventions\r\nwhile their sole aim was to destroy the People’s Party, to do what all\r\nthe hosts of plutocracy had failed to do.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the vote for fusion had been announced in the convention as\r\nprevailing, more than half the delegates present—whole counties had been\r\nvoted for fusion when only one or two delegates were in the city—rose and\r\nleft. The next morning they hired a hall and discussed the proposition\r\nof putting a straight Populist ticket in the field, but when it was\r\nremembered that the fusionists had the legal organization and the ticket\r\nwould have to go on the ballot under some other name than People’s Party\r\nthe project was abandoned. The result was that 20,000 Populists voted\r\nthe Republican ticket, 30,000 stayed at home and refused to vote, and\r\na little over 20,000 voted the Populist national ticket. The Senate of\r\nthe Nebraska Legislature was solidly Republican; the House had only nine\r\nfusionists in it. Mr. Bryan saw to it that they all cast their votes for\r\na straight Democrat for United States Senator. All that was necessary to\r\nget the fusionists to do that, both those who called themselves Democrats\r\nand those who called themselves Populists, was for them to imagine that\r\nthey heard a far-off rumble that sounded like the voice of Bryan saying:\r\n“Vote for a Democrat.”\r\n\r\nWhen the conventions were over and the campaign committees appointed,\r\nthe fusionists found that it was a difficult thing to make a campaign\r\nin Nebraska. Something must be done to get the _Independent_ to fight\r\nthe battle for them, but the _Independent_ still declared that it would\r\nnot support a Parker Democrat. Then, sad to relate, the editor of the\r\n_Independent_ got taken in himself.\r\n\r\nThe chairman of the Democratic State Committee, a brother-in-law to\r\nBryan, came to Mr. Tibbles declaring that he represented Mr. Bryan and\r\nwas speaking in Bryan’s name, and made the following proposition:\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Tibbles would spend most of his time out of the state during the\r\ncampaign, and let the _Independent_ support the fusion ticket, all of\r\nwhose nominees except three were Populists, Mr. Bryan on his part would\r\nagree to go to Arizona or Colorado and get sick. He would continue to\r\nkeep sick until the close of the campaign, so sick that he would not be\r\nable to make any political speeches at all. An exception was made in\r\nregard to Indiana. It was said that Mr. Bryan had promised to make three\r\nspeeches in Indiana in support of his old personal friend who was running\r\nfor Governor in that state, but it was further stipulated that these\r\nthree speeches should not be political speeches, but repetitions of Mr.\r\nBryan’s lecture on “Ideals.”\r\n\r\nMr. Bryan went to Arizona and sent home a letter saying that he was\r\nworse and would not be able to deliver any political speeches during the\r\ncampaign. That letter was printed in the Lincoln daily papers and was\r\nshown to Mr. Tibbles as proof that Mr. Bryan was keeping his contract.\r\n\r\nThe chairman of the Democratic State Committee went to New York, saw\r\nParker, Sheehan, Belmont, Tom Taggart and the rest of the band of\r\nfinancial and political pirates. He came home with money for campaign\r\nexpenses. Then Mr. Bryan hired a special train and started out\r\nspeech-making in Nebraska and in other states. The surprising rapidity\r\nwith which his lung healed has never been equaled in all the history of\r\nmedicine. But when the votes were counted it was learned that wherever\r\nMr. Bryan spoke, whether from the rear end of his car, on a platform\r\nby the railway side, or in theatre or hall, a tidal wave of Republican\r\nvotes followed him, although he pleaded with his Democratic hearers to\r\nbe “regular.” Hundreds of thousands of Democrats listened to this man,\r\nwho for eight years had been denouncing Wall Street and all its ways,\r\nand was now consorting with the most disreputable part of Wall Street,\r\nurging them to vote to keep it in power. Humiliated, sad at heart,\r\ntheir idol carrying the banner of the enemy, in the enemy’s ranks, they\r\nturned their backs in scorn upon Mr. Bryan, went to the polls and voted\r\nthe Republican ticket. If they were to have Wall Street and plutocracy,\r\nthey wanted the old, genuine article, not “something just as good.” The\r\nfusionists declared that wherever Watson or Tibbles spoke they made votes\r\nfor Roosevelt. They did not make one Roosevelt vote where Bryan made a\r\nthousand.\r\n\r\nMr. Berge—George Washington Berge—received a large vote for Governor.\r\nThat was because Mickey, the Republican, who was running for re-election,\r\nwas cordially hated by the whole Republican Party. Thirty thousand\r\nRepublicans voted for Berge, and then he was defeated. But Berge is a\r\nfusionist. He wants office, and especially the office of Governor of\r\nNebraska.\r\n\r\nIt seemed necessary, if Mr. Bryan was to prove his undying love for the\r\nDemocratic Party, to convince all Eastern Democrats that he would forever\r\nprove “regular” no matter who was nominated or what the platform was,\r\nand it seemed to the fusionists, if they were to have any of the spoils\r\nof victory when the national Government was captured, that the People’s\r\nParty must be destroyed. It must never hold another state or national\r\nconvention. They all agreed that the party had done a wonderful work for\r\nthe nation, that its principles were being everywhere adopted, but it\r\nmust be crucified, officially pronounced dead and buried, and the first\r\nstep toward that object was the destruction of the _Nebraska Independent_.\r\n\r\nMr. Berge is a lawyer. He never has had a day’s experience in a newspaper\r\noffice. He announced that he would start a paper in Lincoln in opposition\r\nto the _Independent_. Then a proposition was made to the proprietor of\r\nthe _Independent_ to sell out. A very large price was offered. When the\r\nproprietor faced these facts he began to get discouraged. He had grown\r\nup in Lincoln. He had associated with these fusionists for years. The\r\nfight which he saw in the near future with these men was an unpleasant\r\nthing to contemplate. The cost of running a great newspaper plant is\r\nlarge. When it was known that the home advertising would in part be lost,\r\nand also a large share of the job work, the moment the editor defied\r\nBryan and the fusionists, the outlook was gloomy. To those whom the\r\n_Independent_ had always fought in the city and state were to be added\r\nhundreds of others who had passed as friends. And the proprietor became\r\ndiscouraged.\r\n\r\nIt _is_ somewhat discouraging to go to a convention ostensibly composed\r\nof men of your own party and see the most active members of it engaged in\r\na scheme to destroy your party. These have been the conditions in every\r\nPopulist convention in the state of Nebraska since 1890. The only thing\r\nthat prevented the party from being destroyed sooner was the _Nebraska\r\nIndependent_. The fusionists became more and more convinced of that\r\nfact, and the scheme was invented to publish a paper in opposition in\r\nthe same city, which, while claiming to be Populistic, would work for\r\nthe destruction of the party. Credit for the invention belongs to George\r\nWashington Berge. The hope was entertained that when the People’s Party\r\nwas destroyed all the Populists would go into the Democratic Party, and\r\nGeorge Washington Berge would be Governor and W. J. Bryan United States\r\nSenator.\r\n\r\nThe proprietor of the _Independent_ was bound in the contract\r\ntransferring to George Washington Berge the title to the paper, not to\r\nengage in the business of publishing a reform paper for five years, but\r\nthe fusionists found that it would be impossible to put any shackles on\r\nthe editor. He intends to fight on. Just as all the world is beginning to\r\naccept Populist principles he does not propose to sheathe his sword and\r\nstand by, a passive spectator. The greatest battle of the age is to be\r\nfought. He “is going up against” that crowd again.\r\n\r\nThe columns of the _Independent_ have been an open forum for any man who\r\nthought he had something that would benefit humanity. In the columns of\r\nthe paper he could always voice his sentiments. Besides that, it has been\r\na journal of economics, sociology, philosophy, ethics, finance, single\r\ntax, land, Government and all the decent news. Now it has gone into the\r\nhands of an ordinary Western lawyer who never read a standard work of\r\nauthority on any one of these subjects. It is to be a personal organ\r\nafter the fashion of the one that W. J. Bryan publishes in the same town.\r\nW. J. Bryan is the most accomplished orator of the day. He has personal\r\nacquaintances in every state and territory. Millions have met and shaken\r\nhands with him. George W. Berge has some acquaintances outside of\r\nLancaster County, Nebraska, and besides that, Berge is a Populist engaged\r\nin destroying the Populist Party. These are his elements of success.\r\n\r\nThe Populists of the different states and territories who have been\r\nreaders of the _Independent_ will in the near future have a place to\r\nexpress their views and read discussions of the great problems that are\r\npressing for solution. We will be heard. For years not a great daily\r\nwould print a line in defense of the fundamental principles of Populism.\r\nNow magazines are making fortunes for their proprietors who have admitted\r\nsome of these principles to their pages. Some of these magazines have\r\na greater circulation than was ever known before anywhere in the world\r\nfor monthly periodical literature. The People’s Party is not dead. The\r\n_Nebraska Independent_ will rise from its ashes stronger and better\r\nthan ever before. The vilest, rottenest, worst smelling spot in all the\r\npreserves of plutocracy is that place where the fusionist roams, seeking\r\nto destroy the organization that gave him the only opportunities of his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _Pole Baker_\r\n\r\n                            BY WILL N. HARBEN\r\n            _Author of “The Georgians,” “Abner Daniel,” etc._\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SYNOPSIS OF PREVIOUS CHAPTERS\r\n\r\n        In a small Georgia town a friendship has grown up between\r\n      Pole Baker, reformed moonshiner and an unusual and likable\r\n      character, and young Nelson Floyd, who was left as a baby in\r\n      a mountain cabin by an unknown woman just before her death.\r\n      Floyd, in the face of many trials and temptations, has worked\r\n      his way up in the world and made a man of himself. Jeff Wade\r\n      appears at the store, in which Floyd has become a partner,\r\n      to avenge on him a rumored injustice to Wade’s sister. Pole\r\n      Baker’s tact prevents a duel by making Floyd see that the\r\n      unselfish course is for him to avoid a meeting. Cynthia\r\n      Porter comes to the store, alarmed for Floyd’s safety. On his\r\n      way home to his family Pole falls a victim to his besetting\r\n      sin of drink. Cynthia rejects the suit of the Rev. Jason\r\n      Hillhouse and refuses to act on his warnings against Floyd’s\r\n      attentions. At a corn-shucking given by Pole, Floyd wins\r\n      the right to kiss Cynthia, and on their way home claims his\r\n      privilege without actually asking to marry her and proposes\r\n      in vain that, since her mother dislikes him, she meet him at\r\n      times on signal in the grape-arbor. That night, while Cynthia\r\n      is regretting even her slight weakness, her suspicious and\r\n      tactless mother half accuses her and hints that the worry\r\n      over Cynthia and Floyd has caused her to fear an attack of\r\n      insanity.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nOn the following Saturday morning there was a considerable gathering of\r\nfarmers at Springtown. A heavy fall of rain during the night had rendered\r\nthe soil unfit for plowing, and it was a sort of enforced holiday. Many\r\nof them stood around Mayhew & Floyd’s store. Several women and children\r\nwere seated between the two long counters, on boxes and the few available\r\nchairs. Nelson Floyd was at the high desk in the rear, occupied with\r\nbusiness letters, when Pole Baker came in at the back door and stood near\r\nhim, closely scanning the long room.\r\n\r\n“Where’s the old man?” he asked when Floyd looked up and saw him.\r\n\r\n“Not down yet; dry up, Pole! I was making a calculation and you knocked\r\nit hell-west and crooked.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I reckon that kin wait. I’ve got a note fer you.” Pole was taking\r\nit from his coat pocket.\r\n\r\n“Miss Cynthia?” Floyd asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n“Not by a long shot,” said Pole. “I reckon maybe you’ll wish it was.” He\r\nthrew the missive on the desk and went on in quite a portentous tone: “I\r\ncome by Jeff Wade’s house, Nelson, on my way back from the mill. He was\r\ninside with his wife and childern, an’ as I was passin’ one of the little\r\nboys run out to the fence and called me in to whar he was. He’s a queer\r\nfellow! I saw he was tryin’ to keep his wife in the dark, fer what you\r\nreckon he said?”\r\n\r\n“How do I know?” The young merchant, with a serious expression of face,\r\nhad torn open the envelope but not yet unfolded the sheet of cheap,\r\nblue-lined writing paper.\r\n\r\n“Why, he jest set thar in his chair before the fire, an’ as he handed it\r\nup to me he sorter looked knowin’ an’ said, said he: ‘Pole, I’m owin’\r\nMayhew & Floyd a little balance on my account, an’ they seem uneasy. I\r\nwish you’d take this here note to young Floyd. He’s always stood to me\r\nsorter, an’ I believe he’ll git old Mayhew to wait on me a little while.’”\r\n\r\n“Did he say that, Pole?” Floyd had opened the note, but was looking\r\nstraight into Baker’s eyes.\r\n\r\n“Yes, he said them words, Nelson, although he knowed I was on hand that\r\nday when he paid off his bill in full. I couldn’t chip in thar before\r\nhis wife, an’ the Lord knows I couldn’t tell him I had an idea what was\r\nin the note, so I rid on as fast as I could. I had a turn o’ meal under\r\nme an’ I tuck it off an’ hid it in the thicket t’other side o’ Duncan’s\r\nbig spring. I wasn’t goin’ to carry a secret war message a-straddle o’\r\ntwo bushels o’ meal warm from the rocks. An’ I’d bet my hat that scrap o’\r\npaper means battle.”\r\n\r\nFloyd read the note. There was scarcely a change in the expression of his\r\nface or a flicker of his eyelashes as he folded it with steady fingers\r\nand held it in his hand.\r\n\r\n“Yes, he says he has got the whole story, Pole,” Floyd said. “He gives me\r\nfair warning as a man of honor to arm myself. He will be here at twelve\r\no’clock to the minute.”\r\n\r\n“Great God!” Pole ejaculated. “You hain’t one chance in a million to\r\nescape with yore life. You seed how he shot t’other day. He was excited\r\nthen—he was as calm as a rock mountain when I seed him a while ago, an’\r\nhis ride to town will steady ’im more. He sorter drawed down his mouth at\r\none corner an’ cocked up his eye, same as to say: ‘You understand; thar\r\nhain’t no use in upsettin’ women folks over a necessary matter o’ this\r\nsort.’ Looky here, Nelson, old friend, some’n has got to be done, an’\r\nit’s got to be done in a hurry.”\r\n\r\n“It will have to be done at twelve o’clock, anyway,” Floyd said calmly, a\r\ngrim smile almost rising to his face. “That’s the hour he’s set.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean to tell me you are a-goin’ to set thar like a knot on a log\r\nan’ ’low that keen-eyed mountain sharpshooter to step up in that door an’\r\npeg away at you?”\r\n\r\n“No, I don’t mean that, exactly, Pole,” Floyd smiled coldly. “A man ought\r\nnot to insult even his antagonist that way. You see, that would be making\r\nthe offended party liable for wilful, cold-blooded murder before the law.\r\nNo, I’ve got my gun here in the drawer, and we’ll make a pretense at\r\nfighting a duel, even if he downs me in the first round.”\r\n\r\n“You are a darn fool, that’s what you are!” Pole was angry without\r\nknowing why. “Do you mean to tell me you are a-goin’ to put yore life up\r\nlike that to gratify a scamp like Jeff Wade?”\r\n\r\n“I’d deserve to be kicked off the face of the earth,” Floyd responded\r\nwith firmness, “if I turned tail and ran. He seems to think I may light\r\nout; I judge that by his setting the time a couple of hours ahead, but\r\nI’ll give him satisfaction. I’m built that way, Pole. There is no use\r\narguing about it.”\r\n\r\n“My God, my God!” Pole said under his breath. “Hush! Thar comes Mayhew. I\r\nreckon you don’t want him to know about it!”\r\n\r\n“No, he’d be in for swearing out a peace warrant. For all you do, don’t\r\nlet him on to it, Pole. I want to write a letter or two, before Wade\r\ncomes. Don’t let the old man interrupt me.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll feel like I’m dancin’ on yore scaffold,” the farmer growled. “I\r\nwant my mind free to—to study. Thar! He’s stopped to talk to Joe Peters.\r\nSay, Nelson, I see Mel Jones down thar talkin’ to a squad in front o’ the\r\ndoor; they’ve got the’r heads packed together as close as sardines. I see\r\nthrough it now. By God, I see through _that_!”\r\n\r\n“What is it you see through, Pole?” Floyd looked up from Wade’s note, his\r\nbrow furrowed.\r\n\r\n“Why, Mel’s Jeff Wade’s fust cousin; he’s on to what’s up, an’ he’s\r\nconfidin’ it to a few; it will be all over this town in five minutes, an’\r\nthe women an’ childern will hide out to keep from bein’ hit. Thar they\r\ncome in at the front now, an’ they are around the old man like red ants\r\nround the body of a black one. He’ll be on to it in a minute. Thar, see?\r\nWhat did I tell you? He’s comin’ this way. You can tell by the old duck’s\r\nwalk that he’s excited.”\r\n\r\nFloyd muttered something that escaped Pole’s ears, and set to work\r\nwriting. Mayhew came on rapidly, tapping his heavy cane on the floor, his\r\neyes glued on the placid profile of his young partner.\r\n\r\n“What’s this I hear?” he panted. “Has Jeff Wade sent you word that he was\r\ncomin’ here to shoot you?”\r\n\r\nPole laughed out merrily, and, stepping forward, slapped the old merchant\r\nfamiliarly on the arm. “It’s a joke, Mr. Mayhew!” he said. “I put it\r\nup on Mel Jones as we rid in town; he’s always makin’ fun o’ women fer\r\ntattlin’, an’ said I to myse’f, said I, ‘I’ll see how deep that’s rooted\r\nunder yore hide, old chap,’ an’ so I made that up out o’ whole cloth. I\r\nwas jest tellin’ Nelson, here, that I’d bet a hoss to a ginger-cake that\r\nMel ’ud not be able to keep it, an’ he hain’t. Nelson, by George, the\r\ntriflin’ skunk let it out inside o’ ten minutes, although he swore to me\r\nhe’d keep his mouth shet. I’ll make ’im set up the drinks on that.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I don’t like such jokes!” Mayhew fumed. “Jokes like that and\r\nwhat’s at the bottom of them don’t do a reputable house any good. And I\r\ndon’t want any more of them. Do you understand, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, I won’t do it ag’in,” answered Pole in an almost absent-minded\r\ntone. His eyes were now on Floyd, and despite his assumed lightness of\r\nmanner the real condition of things was bearing heavily on him. Just then\r\na rough-looking farmer, in a suit of home-made jeans, straw hat and shoes\r\nworn through at the bottom, came back to them. He held in his hand the\r\npoint of a plow and looked nervously about him.\r\n\r\n“Everybody’s busy down in front,” he said, “an’ I want to git a quarter’s\r\nwuth o’ coffee.” His glance, full of curiosity, was now on Floyd’s face.\r\n“I want to stay till Wade comes, _myself_, but my old woman’s almost got\r\na spasm. She says she seed enough bloodshed durin’ the war, an’ then she\r\nalways liked Mr. Floyd. She says she’d mighty nigh as soon see an own\r\nbrother laid out as him. Mr. Floyd sorter done us a favor two year back\r\nwhen he stood fer us on our corn crop, an’, as fer me, why, of course,\r\nI——”\r\n\r\n“Look here, Bill Champ,” Pole burst out in a spontaneous laugh. “I\r\nthought you had more sense than to swallow a joke like that. Go tell yore\r\nold woman that I started that tale jest fer pure fun. Nelson here an’\r\nWade is good friends.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, well, ef that’s it, that’s different,” the farmer said. “But from\r\nthe way Mel Jones talked down thar a body would think you fellers was\r\nback here takin’ Mr. Floyd’s measure fer his box. I’ll go quiet my wife.\r\nShe couldn’t talk of a thing all the way here this mornin’ but a new\r\ndress she was goin’ to git an’ now she’s fer hurryin’ back without even\r\npickin’ out the cloth.”\r\n\r\n“No, I don’t like this sort o’ thing,” old Mayhew growled as the customer\r\nmoved away. “An’ I want you to remember that, Baker.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, you dry up, old man!” Pole retorted, with a mechanical laugh. “You’d\r\nlive longer an’ enjoy life better ef you’d joke more. Ef the marrow o’ my\r\nbones was as sour as yourn is I’d cut my throat or go into the vinegar\r\nbusiness.”\r\n\r\nAt this juncture Captain Duncan came in the store and walked back to the\r\ntrio.\r\n\r\n“Good morning,” he said cheerily. “Say, Floyd, I’ve heard the news, and\r\nthought if you wanted to borrow a pair of real, good, old-fashioned\r\ndueling pistols, why, I’ve got a pair my father owned. They were once\r\nused by General——”\r\n\r\n“It’s all a joke, Captain,” Pole broke in, winking at the planter and\r\ncasting a look of warning at the now unobservant Mayhew.\r\n\r\n“Oh, is _that_ it?” Duncan was quick of perception. “To tell you the\r\ntruth, I thought so, boys. Yes, yes”—he was studying Floyd’s calm face\r\nadmiringly—“yes, it sounded to me like a prank somebody was playing.\r\nWell, I thought I’d go fishing this evening, and came in to get some\r\nhooks and lines. Fine weather, isn’t it? But the river’s muddy. I’ll go\r\ndown and pick out some tackle.”\r\n\r\nHe had just gone when an old woman wearing a cheap breakfast shawl over\r\nher gray head, a dress of dingy solid black calico and a pair of old,\r\nheavy shoes approached from the door in the rear.\r\n\r\n“I got yore summons, Mr. Mayhew,” she said in a thin, shaky voice.\r\n“Peter, my husband, was so downhearted that he wouldn’t come to town, an’\r\nso I had to do it. So you are goin’ to foreclose on us? The mule an’ cow\r\nis all on earth we’ve got to make the crop on, and when they are gone we\r\nwill be plumb ruined.”\r\n\r\nThe face of the old merchant was like carved stone.\r\n\r\n“You got the goods, didn’t you, Mrs. Stark?” he asked harshly.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, nobody hain’t disputin’ the account,” she answered plaintively.\r\n\r\n“And you agreed faithfully if you didn’t pay this spring that the mule\r\nand cow would be our property?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, of course! As I say, Mr. Mayhew, I’m not blamin’ you-uns. Thar\r\nhain’t a thing for me an’ Peter to do but thrust ourselves on my daughter\r\nand son-in-law over in Fannin, but I’d rather die than go. We won’t be\r\nwelcome; they are loaded down with childern too young to work. So it’s\r\nsettled, Mr. Mayhew—I mean ef we drive over the mule an’ cow thar won’t\r\nbe no lawsuit?”\r\n\r\n“No, there won’t be any suit. I’d let this pass and give you more time,\r\nMrs. Stark, but a thing like that can’t be kept quiet through the\r\ncountry, an’ there are fifty customers of ours over your way who ’ud be\r\nrunning here with some cock-and-bull story and we’d be left high and dry\r\nwith the goods to pay for in market and nothing to show for it. We make\r\nour rules, Mrs. Stark, and they are clearly understood at the time the\r\npapers are signed.”\r\n\r\n“Never you mind, Mrs. Stark, I’ll fix that all right.” It was Nelson\r\nFloyd who was speaking, and with a face full of pity and tenderness he\r\nhad stepped forward and was offering to shake hands.\r\n\r\nThe little woman, her lips twitching and drawn, gave him her trembly\r\nhand, her eyes wide open in groping wonder.\r\n\r\n“I don’t understand, Nelson—Mr. Floyd. You mean——?”\r\n\r\n“I mean that I’ll have your entire account charged to me and you can take\r\nyour time about paying it—next fall or the next, or any time it suits\r\nyou. I’ll not press you for it, if you never pay it. I passed your place\r\nthe other day, and your crop looks very promising. You are sure to get\r\nout of debt this coming fall.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Nelson—I—I don’t know what to do about it. Mr. Mayhew says——”\r\n\r\n“But I say it’s all right,” Floyd broke in as he laid his hand softly on\r\nher shoulder. “Go down in front and buy what you need to run on. I’ll\r\nassume the risk, if there is any.”\r\n\r\nMayhew turned suddenly; his face was white and his lip shook.\r\n\r\n“Do you mean to say that you are going to step in and——?”\r\n\r\n“Step in nothing,” Floyd said calmly. “I hope I won’t have to remind\r\nyou, sir, of our clearly written agreement of partnership in which it is\r\nplainly stated that I may use my judgment in regard to customers whenever\r\nI wish.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll ruin us—you’ll break us all to smash, if you do this sort of\r\nthing,” Mayhew panted. “It will upset our whole system.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t agree with you, sir,” Floyd answered, “but we won’t argue about\r\nit. If you don’t intend to abide by our agreement then say so and we will\r\npart company.”\r\n\r\nMayhew stared in alarm for a moment, then he said:\r\n\r\n“There’s no use talking about parting. I only want to kind of hold you in\r\ncheck. You get your sympathies stirred up and make plunges sometimes when\r\nyou ought to act with a clear head. You say the crop looks well; then,\r\nit’s all right. Go ahead, Mrs. Stark. Anything Nelson does is agreeable\r\nto me.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it’s mighty good of you both,” the old woman said, wiping tears of\r\njoy from her eyes. “No, I won’t buy anything today. I’ll ride out to the\r\nfarm as quick as I can and tell Peter the good news. He’s mighty nigh out\r\nof his senses about it.”\r\n\r\nMayhew followed her down into the store. It was as if he were ashamed to\r\nmeet the quizzical look which Pole Baker had fixed upon him. He had no\r\nsooner turned his back than Pole faced Floyd and asked: “How does she\r\nstand by your ticker?”\r\n\r\nFloyd looked at his watch. “It’s a quarter-past eleven,” he said.\r\n\r\n“The hell it is!” Pole went to the back door and looked out at the dreary\r\nstable-yard and barn. He stood there for several minutes in deep thought.\r\nThen he seemed to make up his mind on something that was troubling him,\r\nfor he suddenly thrust his hand into his hip-pocket and drew out a\r\nrevolver and rapidly twirled the cylinder with his heavy thumb.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I ’lowed I’d swore off from shootin’ scrapes,” he mused; “but I\r\nshore have to git in this ’un. I’d never look Sally an’ the childern\r\nin the face agin ef I was to stand still an’ let that dead shot kill\r\nthe best friend me an’ them ever had. No, Poley, old boy, you’ve got to\r\nenlist this mornin’, an’ thar hain’t no two ways about it. I’d take a\r\ndrink on that, but a feller’s aim hain’t wuth a dang when he sees double.”\r\n\r\nHis attention was suddenly attracted to Floyd, who had left his stool and\r\nwas putting a revolver into the pocket of his sack coat. Pole shoved his\r\nown cautiously back into his pocket and went to his friend’s side.\r\n\r\n“What you goin’ to do now?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“I have just thought of something that ought to be attended to,” was\r\nFloyd’s answer. “Is Mel Jones still down there?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; I see ’im now through the left-hand window,” said Pole. “Do you\r\nwant to see ’im?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.” Floyd moved in the direction indicated and Pole wonderingly\r\nfollowed. Outside on the pavement at the corner of the store Mel Jones\r\nstood talking to a group of eager listeners. He stopped when he saw\r\nFloyd, and looked in the opposite direction, but in a calm voice the\r\nyoung merchant called him.\r\n\r\n“Mel, may I see you a minute?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly.” The face of the gaunt farmer fell as he came forward, his\r\neyes shifting uneasily.\r\n\r\n“I got a message from Jeff Wade just now,” said Floyd.\r\n\r\n“Oh, did you? Is that so?” the fellow exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Yes; he says he has a private matter to settle with me, and says he’ll\r\nbe here at the store at twelve. Now, as you see, there are a good many\r\npeople standing around—women and children, and somebody might get hurt or\r\nfrightened. You know where Price’s spring is, down behind the old brick\r\nyard?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes; I know where it is, Floyd.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you will do me a favor if you will ride out to Wade’s and tell him\r\nI’ll meet him there. He could reach it without coming through town, and\r\nwe’d escape a lot of prying people who would be in the way.”\r\n\r\n“That’s a good idea,” said Jones, his strong face lighting up. “Yes, I’ll\r\ngo tell ’im. I’m glad to see that you are a man o’ backbone, Floyd. Some\r\n’lowed you’d throw up the sponge an’ leave fer parts unknown, but Jeff’s\r\ngot to tackle the rale stuff. I kin see that, Floyd. Minnie Wade raised a\r\nlots o’ devilment, an’ my wife says whatever rumors spread about her was\r\nher own fault. But Jeff cayn’t be expected to see it through a woman’s\r\neyes. I wish you was goin’ to meet a man that wasn’t sech a dead shot. I\r\nseed Jeff knock a squirrel out of a high tree with his six-shooter that\r\nthree men had missed with rifles.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll try to take care of myself, Mel. But you’d better hurry up and get\r\nto him before he starts to town.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I’ll git ’im all right,” said the farmer, and he went out to the\r\nhitching-rack, jumped on his horse and galloped away.\r\n\r\nThe group Jones had been talking to now drew near, their eyes and mouths\r\nopen.\r\n\r\n“It’s all off, boys,” Pole said, with one of his inscrutable laughs.\r\n“Explanations an’ apologies has been exchanged—no gore today. It was a\r\nbig mistake all round.”\r\n\r\nThis version soon spread, and a sigh of relief went up from everybody.\r\nFifteen minutes passed. Pole was standing in the front door of the\r\nstore, cautiously watching Floyd, who had gone back to his desk to write\r\na letter. Suddenly Pole missed him from his place.\r\n\r\n“He’s tryin’ to give me the slip,” Pole said. “He’s gone out at the back\r\ndoor and has made fer the spring. Well, he kin _think_ he’s throwed old\r\nPole off, but he hain’t by a jugful. I know now which road Jeff Wade will\r\ncome by, an’ I’ll see that skunk before Nelson does or no prayers hain’t\r\nanswered.”\r\n\r\nHe went out to the hitching-rack, mounted, and, waving his hand to the\r\nfew bystanders who were eying him curiously, rode away, his long legs\r\nswinging back and forth from the flanks of his horse. A quarter of a\r\nmile outside of the village he came to a portion of the road leading to\r\nJeff Wade’s house that was densely shaded, and there he drew rein and\r\ndismounted.\r\n\r\n“Thar hain’t no other way fer ’im to come,” he said, “an’ he’s my\r\nmeat—that is, unless the damn fool kin be fetched to reason.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nThere was a quilting party at Porter’s that day. Cynthia had invited\r\nsome of her friends to help her, and the quilt, a big square of colored\r\nscraps, more or less artistically arranged in stars, crescents and floral\r\nwreaths, occupied the centre of the sitting-room. It was stitched to a\r\nframe of four smooth wooden bars, which were held together at the corners\r\nby pegs driven into gimlet holes and which rested on the backs of four\r\nchairs. The workers sat on two sides of it and stitched, with upward and\r\ndownward strokes, toward the centre, the quilt being rolled up as the\r\nwork progressed.\r\n\r\nHattie Mayhew was there, Kitty Welborn and two or three others. As usual\r\nthey were teasing Cynthia about the young preacher.\r\n\r\n“I know she’s the apple of his eye,” laughed Kitty Welborn. “He really\r\ncan’t, as you said the other night, keep from looking at her during\r\npreaching. I noticed it particularly one Sunday not long ago and told\r\nMatt Digby that I’d be sure to get religion if a man bored it into me\r\nwith eyes like his.”\r\n\r\n“I certainly would go up to the mourners’ bench every time he called up\r\nrepentant sinners,” said Hattie Mayhew. “I went up once while he was\r\nexhorting and he turned me over to Sister Perdue, that snaggle-toothed\r\nold maid. He didn’t even offer his hand.”\r\n\r\nCynthia said nothing, but she smiled good-naturedly as she rose from\r\nher chair and went to the side of the quilt near the crudely screened\r\nfireplace to see that the work was rolled evenly on the frame. While thus\r\nengaged her father came into the room, vigorously fanning himself with\r\nhis old slouch hat. The girls knew he had been to the village, and all\r\nasked eagerly if he had brought them any letters.\r\n\r\n“No, I clean forgot to go to the office,” he made slow answer as he threw\r\nhimself into a big armchair with a rawhide bottom, near a window on the\r\nshaded side of the house.\r\n\r\n“Why, father,” his daughter chided him, “you promised the girls\r\nfaithfully to call at the office. I think that was very neglectful of you\r\nwhen you knew they would be here to dinner.”\r\n\r\n“And he usually has a good memory,” spoke up Mrs. Porter, appearing in\r\nthe doorway leading to the dining-room and kitchen. She was rolling\r\nflakes of dough from her lank hands and glanced at her husband\r\nreprovingly. “Nathan, what _did_ you go and do that way for, when you\r\nknew Cynthia was trying to make her friends pass a pleasant day?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I clean forgot it,” Porter said, quite undisturbed. “To tell\r\nyou the truth, thar was so much excitement on all hands, with this un\r\nrunnin’ in with fresh news, an’ that un sayin’ that maybe it was all a\r\nfalse alarm, that the post-office plumb slipped out o’ my head. Huh, I\r\nhain’t thought post-office once sence I left here! I don’t know whether\r\nI could ’a’ got in thar anyway, fer the Postmaster hisse’f was runnin’\r\nround like a camp-meetin’ chicken with its head cut off. Besides, I\r\ntell you, gals, I made up my mind to hit the grit. I never was much of a\r\nhand to want to see wholesale bloodshed. Moreover, I’ve heard of many a\r\nspectator a-gittin’ shot in the arms an’ legs or some vital spot. No, I\r\nsorter thought I’d come on. Mandy, have you seen anything o’ my fly-flap?\r\nWhen company comes you an’ Cynthia jest try yoreselves on seein’ how many\r\nthings you kin put out o’ place, an’ I’m gittin’ sick an’ tired o’——”\r\n\r\n“Nathan, what’s going on in town?” broke in Mrs. Porter. “What are you\r\ntalking about?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what’s goin’ on _now_,” Porter drawled out as he slapped\r\nat a fly on his bald pate with an angry hand. “I say I don’t know what’s\r\ngoin’ on _now_; but I know what was jest gittin’ ready to go on. I reckon\r\nthe coroner’s goin’ on with the inquest ef he ain’t afeared of an ambush.\r\nJeff Wade—” Porter suddenly bethought himself of something, and he rose,\r\npassed through the composite and palpable stare of the whole room and\r\nwent to the clock on the mantelpiece and opened it. “Thar!” he said\r\nimpatiently. “I wonder what hole or crack you-uns have stuck my chawin’\r\ntobacco in. I put it right in the corner of this clock, right under the\r\nturpentine bottle.”\r\n\r\n“There’s your fool tobacco!” Mrs. Porter exclaimed, running forward and\r\ntaking the dark plug from beneath the clock. “Fill your mouth with it;\r\nmaybe it will unlock your jaw. What is the trouble at Springtown?”\r\n\r\n“I was jest startin’ to tell you,” said Porter, diving into his capacious\r\ntrousers pocket for his knife and slowly opening the blade with his long\r\nthumbnail. “You see, Jeff Wade has at last got wind o’ all that gab about\r\nMinnie an’ Nelson Floyd, an’ he sent a war-cry by Pole Baker on hossback\r\nas fast as Pole could clip it to tell Floyd to arm an’ be ready at\r\nexactly twelve o’clock sharp.”\r\n\r\n“I knew it would come,” said Mrs. Porter, a combination of finality and\r\nresignation in her harsh voice. “I knew Jeff Wade wasn’t going to allow\r\nthat talk to go on.” She was looking at her daughter, who, white and\r\nwide-eyed, stood motionless behind Hattie Mayhew’s chair. For a moment\r\nno one spoke, though instinctively the general glance went to Cynthia,\r\nwho, feeling it, turned to the window looking out upon the porch, and\r\nstood with her back to the room. Mrs. Porter broke the silence, her words\r\ndirected to her daughter.\r\n\r\n“Jeff Wade will kill that man if he was fool enough to wait and meet him.\r\nDo you think Floyd waited, Nathan?”\r\n\r\n“No, he didn’t wait,” was Porter’s answer. “The plucky chap went ’im one\r\nbetter; he sent word by Mel Jones to tell Wade that it would be indecent\r\nto have a rumpus like that in town on a Saturday, when so many women an’\r\nchildern was settin’ round in bullet-range, an’ so, if it was agreeable\r\nhe’d ruther have it in the open place at Price’s spring. Mel passed me\r\nas he was goin’ to Jeff with that word. It’s nearly one o’clock now, an’\r\nit’s my candid opinion publicly expressed that Nelson Floyd has gone to\r\nmeet a higher Power. I didn’t want to be hauled up at court as a witness,\r\nan’ so, as I say, I hit the grit. I’ve been tied up in other folks’s\r\nmatters before this, an’ the court don’t allow enough fer witness fees to\r\ntempt me to set an’ listen to them long-winded lawyers talk fer a whole\r\nweek on a stretch.”\r\n\r\n“Poor fellow!” exclaimed Hattie Mayhew. “I’m right sorry for him. He was\r\nso handsome and sweet-natured. He had faults, but they may have been due\r\nto the hard life he had when he was a child. I must say I have always\r\nbeen sorry for him; he had the saddest look out of the eyes of any human\r\nbeing I ever saw.”\r\n\r\n“And he knew how to use his eyes, too,” was the sting Mrs. Porter added\r\nto this charitable comment as her sharp gaze still rested on her daughter.\r\n\r\nThere was a sound at the window. Cynthia, with unsteady hands, was trying\r\nto raise the sash. She finally succeeded in doing this and placing the\r\nwooden prop under it. There was a steely look in her eyes and her\r\nfeatures were set, her face pale.\r\n\r\n“It’s very warm in here!” they heard her say. “There isn’t a bit of\r\ndraught in the room. It’s that hot cook stove, mother; I will—I——”\r\n\r\nShe had turned and walked from the room.\r\n\r\nMrs. Porter sighed as she looked after the departing form.\r\n\r\n“Did you notice her face, girls?” she asked. “It was as white as death\r\nitself. She looked as if she was about to faint. It’s all this talk about\r\nFloyd. Well, they _were_ friends. I tried to get her to stop receiving\r\nhis attentions, but she thought she knew better. Well, he has got his\r\ndeserts, I reckon.”\r\n\r\n“And all on account of the talk about that silly Minnie Wade!” cried\r\nKitty Welborn, “when you know as well as I do, Mrs. Porter, that Thad\r\nPelham—” The speaker glanced at Nathan Porter and paused.\r\n\r\n“Oh, you needn’t let up on yore hen-cackle on my account,” that blunt\r\nworthy made haste to say. “I’ll go out an’ look at my new hogs. You gals\r\nare out fer a day o’ pleasure, an’ I wouldn’t interfere with the workin’\r\nof yore jaws fer a purty.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Porter didn’t remain to hear Kitty Welborn finish her observation,\r\nbut followed her daughter.\r\n\r\nIn the next room, which was the dining-room, an old woman sat at a\r\nwindow. She was dressed in dingy black calico, her snowy hair brushed\r\nsmoothly down over a white wrinkled brow, and was fanning herself slowly\r\nwith a turkey-feather fan. She had Mrs. Porter’s features and thinness of\r\nframe.\r\n\r\n“Mother,” Mrs. Porter said, pausing before her, “didn’t Cynthia come in\r\nhere just now?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, she did,” replied the old woman. “She _did_. And I just want to\r\nknow, Mandy, what you all have been saying to her? I want to know, I say?”\r\n\r\n“We haven’t been saying anything to her as I know of,” said the farmer’s\r\nwife in slow, studious surprise.\r\n\r\n“I know you have, I say, I know you _have_!” The withered hand holding\r\nthe fan quivered in excitement. “I know you have, for I can always tell\r\nwhen that poor child is worried. I heard a little of it, too, but not\r\nall. I heard them mention Hillhouse’s name. I tell you, I am not going to\r\nsit still and let a whole pack of addle-pated women tease as good a girl\r\nas Cynthia is plumb to death.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think they were troubling her,” Mrs. Porter said, her face drawn\r\nin thought, her mind elsewhere.\r\n\r\n“I know they _were_,” the old woman insisted. “She may have hidden it\r\nin there before you all, but when she came in here just now she stopped\r\nright near me and looked me full in the face, and never since she was a\r\nlittle baby have I seen such an odd look in her eyes. They looked like\r\nthey were about to burst with tears. She saw me looking at her, and she\r\ncome up behind me and laid her face down against my neck. She quivered\r\nall over, and then she said, ‘Oh, Granny! Oh, Granny!’ and then she\r\nstraightened up and went right out at that door into the yard. I tell\r\nyou, it’s got to let up. She sha’n’t have the life deviled out of her.\r\nIf she don’t want to marry that preacher, she don’t have to. As for me,\r\nI’d rather have married any sort of man on earth when I was young than a\r\nlong-legged, straight-faced preacher.”\r\n\r\n“You say she went out in the yard?” said Mrs. Porter absently. “I wonder\r\nwhat she went out there for.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Porter went to the door and looked out. There was a clothesline\r\nstretched between two apple trees nearby, and Cynthia stood at it taking\r\ndown a tablecloth. She turned with it in her arms and came to her mother.\r\n\r\n“I just remembered,” she said, “that there isn’t a clean cloth for the\r\ntable. Mother, the iron is hot on the stove. You go back to the girls and\r\nI’ll smooth this out and set the table.”\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the two met. Mrs. Porter took a deep breath. “All right,” she\r\nsaid. “I’ll go back to the company, but I’ve got something to say, and\r\nthen I’m done for good. I want to say that I’m glad a daughter of mine\r\nhas got the proper pride and spunk you have. I see you are not going to\r\nmake a goose of yourself before visitors, and I’m proud of you. You are\r\nthe right sort—especially after he’s acted in the scandalous way he has\r\nand—and laid you, even as good a girl as you, liable to be talked about\r\nfor keeping company with him.”\r\n\r\nThe girl’s eyes sank. Something seemed to rise and struggle up within\r\nher, for her breast heaved and her shoulders quivered convulsively.\r\n\r\n“I’ll fix the cloth,” she said in a low, forced voice, “and then I’ll set\r\nthe table and call you.”\r\n\r\n“All right”; Mrs. Porter was turning away. “I’ll try to keep them\r\nentertained till you come back.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nBeneath a big oak Pole stood holding his bridle-rein and waiting, his\r\nearnest gaze on the long road leading to Jeff Wade’s farm. Suddenly he\r\ndescried a cloud of dust far ahead and he chuckled.\r\n\r\n“He’s certainly on time,” he mused. “He must ’a’ had his hoss ready out\r\nin the thicket. Mel made good time, too. The dern devil is thirstin’ fer\r\nbloodshed. Mel’s that sort. By gum, that hain’t Wade; it’s Mel hisse’f,\r\nan’ he’s certainly layin’ the lash to his animal.”\r\n\r\nIn a gallop Jones bore down on him, riding as wildly as a cowboy, his\r\nbroad hat in one hand, a heavy switch in the other. He drew rein when he\r\nrecognized Baker.\r\n\r\n“Did you deliver that message?” Pole questioned.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, I finally got him alone; his wife seems to suspicion some’n,\r\nand she stuck to ’im like a leech. She’s a jealous woman, Pole, an’ I\r\ndon’t know but what she kinder thought Jeff was up to some o’ his old\r\nshines. He was a sorter tough nut before he married, you know, an’ a man\r\nlike that will do to watch.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what did he say?” Pole asked.\r\n\r\n“Why, he said ‘all hunkydory.’ The spring plan ketched him jest right.\r\nHe said that one thing—o’ bloodyin’ up the main street in town—had\r\nbothered him more than anything else. He admired it in Floyd, too. Jeff\r\nsaid, ‘By gum! fer a town dude that feller’s got more backbone than I\r\nexpected. He’s a foe wuth meetin’, an’ I reckon killin’ ’im won’t be sech\r\na terrible disgrace as I was afeared it mought be.’”\r\n\r\n“But whar are you headin’ fer in sech a rush?” Pole asked.\r\n\r\nJones laughed as he put his hat carefully on his shaggy head and pressed\r\nthe broad brims up on the sides and to a point in front. “Why, Pole,” he\r\nanswered, “to tell you the truth, I am headed fer that thar spring. I’m\r\ngoin’ to acknowledge to you that, as long as I’ve lived in this world, I\r\nhain’t never been on hand at a shootin’ affair. Mighty nigh every man I\r\nknow has seed oodlin’s of ’em, but my luck’s been agin me. About the most\r\nexcitin’ thing I ever attended was a chicken fight, and so I determined\r\nto see this un. I know a big rock jest above that spring, and I’m a-goin’\r\nto git thar in plenty o’ time. You let me git kivered all but my eyes,\r\nan’ I’ll run the resk o’ gettin’ hit from thar up. Whar you makin’ fer,\r\nPole?”\r\n\r\n“Me? Oh, I’m on the way home, Mel. I seed the biggest rattlesnake run\r\nacross this road jest now I ever laid eyes on. I got down to settle his\r\nhash, but I didn’t have anything to hit ’im with, an’ I’m done stompin’\r\nat them fellers sence Tobe Baker, my cousin, over at Hillbend, got\r\nbliffed on the knee.”\r\n\r\n“Well, so long!” Mel laughed. “I’ll hunt rattlesnakes some other time.\r\nAre you plumb shore you hain’t got the jimmies agin’, Pole? Take my\r\nadvice an’ don’t tell about seein’ snakes; it sets folks to thinkin’.\r\nWhy, I seed you once in broad daylight when you swore black spiders was\r\nplayin’ sweepstakes on yore shirt front.”\r\n\r\n“So long, Mel!” Pole smiled and waved his hand. He made a fair pretense\r\nat getting ready to mount as Mel galloped away in a cloud of dust. The\r\nhorseman was scarcely out of sight when a pair of fine black horses\r\ndrawing a buggy came into view. The vehicle contained Captain Duncan and\r\nhis daughter Evelyn. She was a delicate, rather pretty girl of nineteen\r\nor twenty, and she nodded pleasantly to Pole as her father stopped his\r\nhorses.\r\n\r\n“You are sure that thing’s off, are you, Baker?” the planter said, with a\r\ngenial smile.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, Captain.” Pole had his eyes on the young lady and had taken off\r\nhis hat, and stood awkwardly swinging it against the baggy knees of his\r\nrough trousers.\r\n\r\n“Well, I’m very glad,” Duncan said. “I know you told some of the crowd\r\nback at the store that it had been settled, but I didn’t know whether it\r\nwas reliable or not.”\r\n\r\nPole’s glance shifted between plain truth and Evelyn Duncan’s refined\r\nface for a moment, and then he nodded. “Oh, yes, it was all a mistake,\r\nCaptain. Reports get out, you know; and nothin’ hain’t as bad as gossip\r\nis after it’s crawled through a hundred mouths an’ over a hundred\r\nwigglin’ tongues.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’m glad, as I say,” the planter said as he jerked his reins and\r\nspoke to his horses.\r\n\r\nAs he whirled away Pole growled. “Damned ef I hain’t a-makin’ a regular\r\nsignpost out o’ myself,” he mused, “an’ lyin’ to beat the Dutch. Ef that\r\ndern fool don’t come on purty soon he’ll—but thar he is now, comin’ on\r\nwith a swoop—looks like his hoss is about to run from under ’im, his\r\ndern legs is so long. Now, looky here, Pole Baker, Esquire, hog-thief\r\nan’ liar, you are up agin about the most serious proposition you ever\r\ntackled, an’ ef you don’t mind what you are about you’ll have cold feet\r\ninside o’ ten minutes by the clock. You’ve set in to carry this thing\r\nthrough or die in the attempt, an’ time’s precious. The fust thing is to\r\nstop the blamed whelp; you cayn’t reason with a man that’s flyin’ through\r\nthe air like he’s shot out of a gun, an’ Jeff Wade’s a-goin’ to be the\r\ndevil to halt. He’s got the smell o’ blood, an’ that works on a mad man\r\njest like it does on a bloodhound—he’s a-goin’ to run down some’n. The\r\nonly thing in God’s world that’ll stop a man o’ that sort is to insult\r\n’im, an’ I reckon I’ll have that to do in this case.”\r\n\r\nJeff Wade was riding rapidly. Just before he reached Pole he drew out his\r\nbig silver open-faced watch and looked at it. He wore no coat and had on\r\na gray flannel shirt open at the neck. Round his waist he wore a wide\r\nleather belt, from which, on his right side, protruded the glittering\r\nbutt of a revolver of unusual size and length of barrel. Suddenly Pole\r\nled his own horse round, until the animal stood directly across the\r\nnarrow road, rendering it impossible for the approaching rider to pass at\r\nthe speed he was going.\r\n\r\n“Hold on thar, Jeff!” Pole held up his hand. “Whar away? The mail hack\r\nhain’t in yet. I’ve jest left town.”\r\n\r\n“I hain’t goin’ after no mail!” Wade said, his lips tight, a fixed stare\r\nin his big, earnest eyes. “I’m headed fer Price’s spring. I’m goin’ to\r\nput a few holes in that thar Nelson Floyd, ef I git the drap on him ’fore\r\nhe does on me.”\r\n\r\n“Huh!” Pole ejaculated; “no, you hain’t a-goin’ to see him, nuther; that\r\nis, not till me’n you’ve had a talk, Jeff Wade. You seem in a hurry, but\r\nthar’s a matter betwixt me an’ you that’s got to be attended to.”\r\n\r\n“What the hell do you mean?” Wade demanded, a stare of irritated\r\nastonishment dawning in his eyes.\r\n\r\n“Why, I mean that Nelson Floyd is a friend o’ mine, an’ he ain’t a-goin’\r\nto be shot down like a dog by a man that could hit a nickel a hundred\r\nyards away nine times out o’ ten. You an’ me’s close together, an’ I\r\nreckon chances ’ud be somewhar about equal. I hain’t a brag shot, but I\r\ncould hit a pouch as big as yourn is about as easy as you could me.”\r\n\r\n“You—you—by God, do you mean to take this matter up?”\r\n\r\nJeff Wade slid off his horse and stood facing Pole.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I do, Jeff; that is, unless you’ll listen to common sense. That’s\r\nwhat I’m here fer. I’m a-goin’ to stuff reason into you ef I have to make\r\na new hole to put it in at. You are a-goin’ entirely too fast to live in\r\nan enlightened Christian age, an’ I’m here to call a halt. I’ve got some\r\nthings to tell you. They are a-goin’ to hurt like pullin’ eye-teeth, an’\r\nyou may draw yore gun before I’m through, but I’m goin’ to make a try at\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“What the——?”\r\n\r\n“Hold on, hold on, hold on, Jeff!” Pole raised a warning hand. “Keep that\r\npaw off’n that cannon in yore belt or thar’ll be a war right here before\r\nyou hear my proclamation of the terms we kin both live by. Jeff, I am\r\nyore neighbor an’ friend. I love you mighty nigh like a brother, an’ I’m\r\nhere to tell you that, with all yore grit an’ good qualities, you are\r\nmakin’ a bellowin’ jackass o’ yoreself. An’ ef I let you put through yore\r\npresent plans, you’ll weep in repentance fer it till you are let down in\r\nyore soggy grave. Thar’s two sides to every question, an’ you are lookin’\r\nonly at yore side o’ this un. You cayn’t tell how sorry I am about havin’\r\nto take this step. I’ve been a friend to yore entire family—to yore\r\nbrothers, an’ yore old daddy when he was alive. I mighty nigh swore a\r\nlie down in Atlanta to keep _him_ out o’ limbo when he was arrested fer\r\nmoonshinin’.”\r\n\r\n“I know all that!” growled Wade; “but God——”\r\n\r\n“Hold yore taters now, an’ listen! You mought as well take yore mind\r\noff’n that spring. You hain’t a-goin’ to git at Nelson Floyd without you\r\nwalk over my dead body—an’ thar’s no efs an’ ands about that. You try\r\nto mount that hoss, an’ I’ll kill you ef it’s in my power. I say I’ve\r\ngot some’n to tell you that you’ll wish you’d listened to. I know some’n\r\nabout Minnie that will put a new color on this whole nasty business; an’\r\nwhen you know it, ef you kill Nelson Floyd in cold blood, the law will\r\njerk that stiff neck o’ yourn—jerk it till it’s limber.”\r\n\r\n“You say you know some’n about Minnie?” The gaunt hand which till now\r\nhad hovered over the butt of the big revolver hung down straight. He\r\nstood staring, his lip hanging loose, a sudden droop of indecision upon\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“I know this much, Jeff,” Pole said, less sharply. “I know you are not\r\nafter the fust offender agin yore family honor, an’ when I prove _that_\r\nto you I don’t believe you’ll look at it the same.”\r\n\r\n“You say—you say——?”\r\n\r\n“Listen now, Jeff, an’ don’t fly off the handle at a well-wisher sayin’\r\nwhat he thinks has to be said in justice to all concerned. The truth is,\r\nyou never seed Minnie like other folks has all along. You seed ’er grow\r\nup an’ she was yore pet. To you she was a regular angel; but other folks\r\nhas knowed all along, Jeff, that she was born with a sorter light nature.\r\nWomen folks, with the’r keen eyes, has knowed that ever since she got out\r\no’ short dresses. Even yore own wife has said behind yore back a heap on\r\nthis line that she was afeared to say to you. Not a soul has dared to\r\ntalk plain to you, an’ even _I_ wouldn’t do it except in this case o’\r\nlife an’ death.”\r\n\r\nWade shook back his long, coarse hair. He was panting like a tired dog.\r\n“I don’t believe a damn word of what you are a-sayin’!” he muttered, “an’\r\nI’ll make you prove it, by God, or I’ll have yore life-blood!”\r\n\r\n“Listen to me, Jeff,” Pole said gently. “I’m not goin’ to threaten any\r\nmore. Believe me or not, _but listen_! You remember when Thad Pelham went\r\noff to Mexico a year or so ago?”\r\n\r\nWade made no reply, but there was a look of dawning comprehension in his\r\ngreat, blearing eyes.\r\n\r\n“I see you remember that,” Pole went on. “Well, you know, too, that he\r\nwas goin’ with Minnie a lot about that time—takin’ her buggy-ridin’ an’\r\nto meetin’. He was a devil in pants; his whole family was bad. The men\r\nin it wouldn’t go in the gate o’ heaven ef a woman was winkin’ at ’em on\r\nthe outside. Well, Thad started fer Mexico one day, an’ at the same time\r\nMinnie went on a visit to yore brother Joe in Calhoun.\r\n\r\n“She went thar a year ago,” Wade said, “fer I bought ’er ticket at\r\nParley.”\r\n\r\n“She told _you_ she went to Calhoun.” Pole’s eyes were mercifully\r\naverted. “I met her an’ Thad in Atlanta.”\r\n\r\nWade caught his breath. He shook from head to foot as with a chill.\r\n\r\n“You say—Pole, you say——?”\r\n\r\nPole pulled at his mustache and looked down.\r\n\r\n“Well, I reckon they wasn’t down thar to attend a Sunday-school\r\nconvention, Jeff—they didn’t have that look to me. But I was so worried\r\nfer fear I mought be doin’ a woman injustice in my mind that, after they\r\nleft me—to make sure, I went in the office o’ the hotel an’ made sure.”\r\n\r\nSuddenly Wade put out his hand and laid it heavily on Pole’s shoulder.\r\n“Looky here, Baker,” he said, “if you are lying to me, I——”\r\n\r\n“Hold on, _hold on_, Jeff Wade!” Pole broke in sternly. “Whenever you use\r\nwords like them you smile! So fer, this has been a friendly talk, as I\r\nsee it; but you begin to intimate that I’m a liar, an’ I’ll try my best\r\nto make you chaw the statement. You’re excited, but you mustn’t go too\r\nfur.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I want the truth, by God, I want the truth!”\r\n\r\n“Well, you are a-gittin’ it, with the measure runnin’ over,” Pole said,\r\n“an’ that ought to satisfy any reasonable man.”\r\n\r\n“So you think then, that Nelson Floyd never done any—any o’ the things\r\nfolks says he did—that ’twas jest report?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I ain’t here to say that, nuther,” said Pole most diplomatically.\r\n“But la me! what a stark, ravin’ fool you was about to make o’ yoreself,\r\nJeff!” Pole went on. “You started to do this thing today on yore sister’s\r\naccount, when by doin’ it you would bust up her home an’ make her life\r\nmiserable.”\r\n\r\n“You mean——?”\r\n\r\n“I mean that Joe Mitchell, that’s been dead stuck on Minnie sence she was\r\na little gal, set up to her an’ proposed marriage. They got engaged an’\r\nthen every old snaggle-toothed busybody in these mountains set in to try\r\nto bust it up by totin’ tales about Floyd an’ others to ’im. As fast as\r\none would come Minnie’d kill it, an’ show Joe what a foolish thing it was\r\nto listen to gossip, an’ Joe finally told ’em all to go to thunder, an’\r\nthey was married an’ moved on his farm in Texas. From all accounts they\r\nare doin’ well an’ are happy; but la me; they wouldn’t be that a-way long\r\nef you’d ’a’ shot Nelson Floyd this mornin’.”\r\n\r\n“You say they wouldn’t, Pole?”\r\n\r\n“Huh, I reckon _you_ wouldn’t dance a jig an’ sing alleluia ef you was to\r\npick up a newspaper this mornin’ an’ read in type a foot long that yore\r\nwife’s brother, in another state, had laid a man out stiff as a board fer\r\nsome’n that folks said had tuck place some time back betwixt the man an’\r\nher.”\r\n\r\n“Huh!” Wade’s glance was now on Pole’s face. “Huh, I reckon you are\r\nright, Pole, I reckon you are right. I wasn’t thinkin’ about that.”\r\n\r\n“Thar was _another_ duty you wasn’t a-thinkin’ about, too,” Pole said.\r\n“An’ that is yore duty to yore wife an’ childern that would be throwed\r\nhelpless on the world ef this thing had ’a’ come off today.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I don’t see _that_, anyway,” said Wade dejectedly.\r\n\r\n“Well, _I_ do, Jeff. You see, ef you’d ’a’ gone on an’ killed Floyd,\r\nafter I halted you, I’d ’a’ been a witness agin you, an’ I’d ’a’ had to\r\ntestify that I told you, in so many words, whar the _rale_ blame laid,\r\nan’ no jury alive would ’a’ spared yore neck.”\r\n\r\n“I reckon that’s so,” Wade admitted. “Well, I guess I’ll go back, Pole.\r\nI won’t go any further with it. I promise you not to molest that scamp.\r\nI’ll not trade any more at his shebang, an’ I’ll avoid ’im all I kin, but\r\nI’ll not kill ’im as I intended.”\r\n\r\n“Now, you’re a-talkin’ with a clear head an’ a clean tongue.” Pole drew a\r\nbreath of relief and stood silent as Wade drew his horse around, put his\r\nfoot into the heavy wooden stirrup and mounted. Pole said nothing until\r\nWade had ridden several paces homeward, then he called out to him, and\r\nbeckoned him back with his hand, going to meet him, leading his horse.\r\n\r\n“I just thought o’ some’n else, Jeff—some’n I want to say. I reckon I\r\nwouldn’t sleep sound tonight, or think of anything the rest o’ the day,\r\nef I don’t git it off my mind.”\r\n\r\n“What’s that, Pole?”\r\n\r\n“Why, I don’t feel right about callin’ you to halt so rough jest now, an’\r\ntalkin’ about shootin’ holes in you an’ the like, fer I hain’t nothin’\r\nagin you, Jeff. In fact, I’m yore friend now more than I ever was in my\r\nlife. I feel fer you _’way down inside o’ me_. The look on yore face cuts\r\nme as keen as a knife. I—I reckon, Jeff, that you sorter feel like—like\r\nyore little sister’s dead, don’t you?”\r\n\r\nThe rough face looking down from the horse filled. “Like she was dead an’\r\nburied, Pole,” Wade answered.\r\n\r\n“Well, Jeff”—Pole’s voice was husky—“don’t you ever think o’ what I said\r\na while ago about shootin’. Jeff, I jest did that to git yore attention.\r\nYou mought ’a’ blazed away at me, but I’ll be derned ef I believe I could\r\n’a’ cocked or pulled trigger on you to ’a’ saved my soul.”\r\n\r\n“Same here, old neighbor,” said Wade as he wiped his eyes on his shirt\r\nsleeve. “I wouldn’t ’a’ tuck them words from no other man on the face o’\r\nGod’s green globe.”\r\n\r\nWhen Wade had ridden slowly away Pole mounted his own horse.\r\n\r\n“Now, I’ll go tell Nelson that the danger is over,” he said. Suddenly he\r\nreined his horse in and sat looking thoughtfully at the ground.\r\n\r\n“No, I won’t,” he finally decided. “He kin set thar an’ wonder what’s\r\nup. I was in a hair’s breadth o’ the grave, about to leave a sweet wife\r\nan’ kids to starvation jest beca’se of him. No, Nelsy, old boy, you look\r\ndeath in the eye fer a while; it won’t do you no harm.”\r\n\r\nAnd Pole Baker rode to the thicket, where he had hidden his bag of\r\ncornmeal that morning, and took it home.\r\n\r\n                          (_To be continued._)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         _A Phase of the Money Problem Bankers Dare Not Discuss_\r\n\r\n                            BY ALBERT GRIFFIN\r\n          _Author of “The Keynote: Substitute Honest Money for\r\n            Fictitious Credit,” “The Hocus Pocus Money Boon”_\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause of limited space, this paper contains little more than\r\nprinciples, facts and conclusions, without argument—and the subject is\r\nconsidered from the practical man’s standpoint rather than that of the\r\ntheorizer. The one monetary proposition to which all schools agree is\r\nthat “money is the medium of exchange.” To be used as such is its one\r\nand only universally admitted purpose—and no other characteristic is\r\nessential. No matter of what it consists, whatever is _willingly_ used by\r\npeople as their medium of exchange is money, and should be so recognized\r\nby everyone—but unfortunately, the greater part of it is not.\r\n\r\nThere is honest money and dishonest money. None is strictly honest that\r\nis not as good as the best—for exchange purposes. Ideal money has the\r\nsame exchange value at all times, and everywhere—and the best money\r\nis that which is nearest the ideal. Without discussing what it should\r\nconsist of, I hold that the material ought to be more substantial than a\r\nbanker’s “confidence” that he will always be able to pay the most of his\r\ndebts with mere debits and credits. As business cannot be done without\r\nmoney, and as each person needs enough of it to enable him to exchange\r\nhis services and products for the services and products of others, it\r\ngoes without saying that there ought to be enough to supply each and all\r\nliberally—and that no man, or set of men, should be allowed to affect\r\nmaterially this supply for selfish purposes.\r\n\r\nTo most people, the soundness of the “quantitative theory” of money is\r\nself-evident. Concisely stated, it is that, whenever the quantity of\r\nmoney in circulation increases faster than the exchanges to be made with\r\nit, commodities tend to rise in price—and _vice versa_—which is but the\r\napplication to money of the inexorable law of supply and demand. While\r\nthe soundness of this theory is generally admitted, every business\r\nman knows that sometimes facts seem to disprove it. In 1890, when the\r\nfailure of Baring Brothers so nearly precipitated a panic throughout this\r\ncountry, the quantity of visible money in circulation was increasing;\r\nand the same fact was true in April, 1893, when the proceedings agreed\r\nupon at the conference between Secretary Carlisle and prominent New York\r\nbankers precipitated a fearful panic on the next business day—and yet, in\r\nboth of these cases, the apparent conflict resulted from the suppression\r\nof a part of the facts.\r\n\r\nNow for the explanation: In comparing the size or weight of two masses\r\nthe whole of each must be contrasted with the whole of the other, and\r\nin comparing two actively operating forces all of the factors of each\r\nmust be considered together, without regard to names. But, strange to\r\nsay, three-fourths of what is being used and paid for as money, and which\r\nreally does the work of money, and does nothing else, is denied the right\r\nof being called money by some doctrinaires—and also by bankers, when\r\ntalking to the public. Although between May 1 and October 1, 1903, the\r\nvolume of metallic and paper money actually increased, this something\r\nwhich had been doing the work of money was contracted $500,000,000 in\r\nNew York City alone—but as it was not called money its relation to the\r\nresults was not generally recognized.\r\n\r\nDeposit banks are little more than clearing-houses; and the laws permit\r\ntheir owners to pay nine-tenths of their debts with money literally made\r\nby themselves—out of nothing—which they coolly call “liquid capital,”\r\nor “bank credit,” although it is neither capital nor credit. The real\r\nnature and far-reaching effects of this modern practice are not clearly\r\nunderstood by one in twenty even of the bankers themselves—and none of\r\nthem dares discuss it publicly. The most of those that do not fully\r\nunderstand it _feel_ that there is something wrong about it; and those\r\nthat do understand it know that, if people once begin to study “the\r\nsystem,” they will demand radical changes in it—or its entire abolition.\r\n\r\nGovernment reports for 1904 put the volume of metallic and paper money\r\nthen in existence at $2,829,273,316—or $31.16 per capita; and the\r\nComptroller’s report shows that the banks whose reports he consolidated\r\nwere earning interest on more than $6,278,000,000 of money that had no\r\nexistence—or $76.47 per capita. This stuff is what, for a dozen years,\r\nI have called “hocus pocus money.” It consists of nothing but, in the\r\nlanguage of Professor Sidgwick, rows of figures on bank books; and yet\r\nit affects business, prices and values, exactly as that amount of real\r\nmoney would. Invisible, intangible and mythical, it is nevertheless very\r\nreal—filling the land with prosperity, joy and song today, and disaster,\r\ntears and despair tomorrow, it is the most potent economic power ever\r\nknown. Business men gladly accept it as money. _The courts treat it as\r\nmoney._ And, although, for technical reasons, most political economists\r\ndo not do so, I insist that, to all intents and purposes, it is money,\r\nand should be so recognized. Indeed, until this shall be done, it will be\r\nimpossible to frame a monetary system that will always work equitably and\r\nbeneficently.\r\n\r\nBetween 1896 and 1904, as officially reported, the increase in the volume\r\nof visible money was, in millions, $1,322,000,000—or $9.75 per capita;\r\nbut the quantity of hocus pocus money in use increased $5,275,000,000—or\r\n$43.42 per capita—the quantity of both kinds then actually in use being\r\n$107.63 per capita. This shows that four-fifths of the increase in the\r\nmedium of exchange consists merely of the right given favored people to\r\ndraw checks on banks to pay which no real money has been deposited.\r\n\r\nIn 1888, 5,866 bank reports showed that they were then collecting\r\ninterest on $3.41 for each dollar of their capital available for\r\n“commercial loans”; but last year’s reports of the 13,772 national, state\r\nand private banks and loan and trust companies show that their aggregate\r\ncapital (including surplus, undivided profits and bank-notes) amounted\r\nto $2,927,000,000. This was everything their owners had put into their\r\nbusiness, and of it $2,743,000,000 had been paid out for bonds, stocks,\r\nreal estate, real estate mortgages, etc., leaving only $183,000,000\r\navailable for “commercial loans.” And yet their “loans and discounts”\r\naggregated $6,431,000,000, or $35.07 of “commercial loans” for every\r\ndollar of their not otherwise invested capital. If this is not “_getting\r\nsomething for nothing_” on a stupendous scale, I should like to know what\r\nwould be so considered.\r\n\r\nRemember, that these figures include all of the reported banks.\r\nIndividual cases are incomparably worse. On December 2, 1899, the\r\nNational City Bank, of New York City (the principal of the several\r\nhundred Standard Oil banks), had $6,709,216 of capital, surplus, etc.;\r\nits investments of capital aggregated $27,270,738; its available capital\r\nwas therefore $20,561,519 _less than nothing_; and yet it was then\r\nactually earning interest on $60,906,034 of “loans and discounts,” making\r\n$81,467,553 of hocus pocus money. And remember further that, to make\r\npeople more dependent on banks for this kind of money with which to do\r\nbusiness, the volume of real money is kept as small as possible. This is\r\nthe real reason why bankers engineered the contraction of the currency\r\nafter the war and the demonetization of silver. But for them no class of\r\nbusiness men would have consented to either of those economic crimes.\r\n\r\nHere are a few more important facts:\r\n\r\n1. Interest has to be paid _to the banks_ on every dollar of hocus pocus\r\nmoney as long as it lives.\r\n\r\n2. It lives, on an average, only about two months.\r\n\r\n3. Every payment of a note or draft extinguishes the hocus pocus money\r\ninvolved in that transaction and contracts its volume that much, making\r\nit the most constantly and wildly fluctuating money ever known.\r\n\r\n4. Whenever, for any reason, bankers fear a demand for an unusual amount\r\nof real money they make fewer “loans” and “call in” some that are\r\noutstanding, which destroys that part of the “liquid capital” that was in\r\nactual use as a medium of exchange and cramps the money market.\r\n\r\n5. Bankers sometimes do these things unnecessarily, for the purpose of\r\nmaking a “bear market”; but it is also true that business conditions\r\nsometimes compel them to do so, as was the case in 1857 and 1873.\r\n\r\n6. If the banks had on hand as much money as they reported (which is not\r\nalways true), they, in 1888, owed $6.01 for every dollar they reported;\r\nand last year the proportion was $9.98 to $1. The sixty-two national\r\nbanks in the central reserve cities are required to keep nearly 25 per\r\ncent. of their deposits on hand in cash; the 285 in the other reserve\r\ncities only 12½ per cent., and the 5,065 in non-reserve cities only 6\r\nper cent. State bank requirements vary greatly, private banks and loan\r\nand trust companies are under few or no restrictions, and the loan and\r\ntrust companies keep only about 2 per cent.\r\n\r\n7. Less than one-tenth of the “deposits” in banks are real money—the\r\nothers being mere promises of the banks to pay money to those who\r\nhave bought (with notes) the right to draw checks against them—and it\r\nis simply impossible to so regulate the system as to prevent it from\r\nfrequently working disastrously.\r\n\r\n8. Contracting the volume of any kind of money that is willingly accepted\r\nby producers always causes suffering. Indeed, modern conditions require a\r\nlarge annual increase in the volume of money; and, with an insufficient\r\nsupply of real money, it is not now possible to prevent the use of hocus\r\npocus money.\r\n\r\n9. It is well known that, when their interests seem to require it, great\r\nbankers defy the laws made to restrain them.\r\n\r\n10. There ought to be places in which people can deposit money and know\r\nit will remain there until checked out by themselves.\r\n\r\nFor ten years I have called attention to the fact that there never has\r\nbeen, in this or any other country, a widespread commercial panic that\r\nwas not caused _solely_ by the sudden contraction of the hocus pocus\r\nmoney then being used by banks, and have challenged contradiction; but\r\nthis challenge has never been accepted. Hocus pocus money _is the one and\r\nonly seriously disturbing factor that has always and everywhere preceded_\r\nthese catastrophes. Other causes aggravate them, but, with it eliminated,\r\npanics would be impossible, because it is this sudden, absolute\r\ndestruction of the bank’s manufactured “liquid capital,” used by so many\r\nas their medium of exchange, which paralyzes their business operations\r\nand makes “the bottom drop out of the market,” as it were.\r\n\r\nNo words are lurid enough to portray properly the terrible evils and\r\npersonal suffering that its use causes, and I submit that it is time\r\npeople should begin to consider earnestly the question, Had we not better\r\ninsist that some kind of real money shall be substituted for the unreal\r\nnow in use, and thus permanently remove the cause that so often produces\r\nsuch baleful results? Conditions were never so favorable for doing this\r\nas they are now. No election is pending; the two great parties are lazily\r\ntalking on similar platforms; all financial organs insist that the\r\ncountry is prospering; and, although people are deeply stirred, they are\r\nnot excited.\r\n\r\nThe use of hocus pocus money, and its evil results, have increased\r\nsteadily from the beginning of the deposit banking system. From time to\r\ntime methods change, but every change increases the power and profits\r\nof the few—and the helplessness of the many. The gravest of these\r\nchanges began to be felt about a decade ago. Leading bankers had always\r\nused some of their hocus pocus money for the promotion of their own\r\nschemes, but from that time the Rockefellers, Morgans and others have\r\nbeen systematically getting control of the principal deposit banking\r\ninstitutions, and using, not only a rapidly increasing proportion of\r\ntheir depositors’ real money, but also more of the hocus pocus money\r\nmade possible by those deposits. Mr. Lawson and others have shown how\r\nthis has been done on a gigantic scale, in specific cases, and of all\r\nunfossilized, sober-minded people I ask, can 999 business men afford to\r\npermit the thousandth man to continue appropriating to his own use the\r\nhocus pocus money their own deposits have made possible—and, in addition,\r\nhelp him to keep the volume of real money ruinously small? Indeed, would\r\nit not be idiotic folly to do so?\r\n\r\nTo me the problem appears to be: How can hocus pocus money be safely\r\neliminated—or so restricted as to be harmless—and the quantity of real\r\nmoney so increased that all will, at all times, be able to exchange\r\ntheir products and services; that commercial panics and long periods of\r\nbusiness depression will become impossible; and that a few men in each\r\ncommunity will no longer have the power to ruin all who refuse to obey\r\ntheir orders?\r\n\r\nSpace will not permit me to tell here how this can be done, but I will\r\nsay that, fortunately, this greatest and most overshadowing of the\r\neconomic problems that confront humanity is the easiest of all to solve;\r\nthat, as bankers are the controlling spirits in—or back of—nearly all\r\ntrusts and combines, settling the money problems will make the solution\r\nof all the others easier; that it can be done without wronging anyone, or\r\nimposing additional burdens on the people; and that economic and social\r\nconditions would improve during the entire process.\r\n\r\nBut suppose that some of my conclusions may not be correct, does not the\r\nexperience of the last hundred years prove, beyond controversy, that our\r\nbanking and financial systems must be radically unsound in some very\r\nimportant particulars? And, if so, should we not insist upon their prompt\r\nimprovement—or the substitution of better ones?\r\n\r\nEvery business man knows that, if the banks were required to keep larger\r\nreserves always on hand, they would be safer places of deposit. And they\r\nare equally well aware that the more real money there is in circulation\r\nthe more prosperous and happy are the people. And the vitally important\r\nquestion is, not how far or how fast shall we go, but, shall we not begin\r\nto move steadily and determinedly in the direction of less danger and\r\nmore permanent prosperity?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               _A Leaf From a Protective Tariff Catechism_\r\n\r\n                (OVERHEARD IN A PROTECTIVE KINDERGARTEN)\r\n\r\n                             BY JOEL BENTON\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. What is Protection?\r\n\r\nA. It is placing a duty upon foreign goods, of many kinds, to enable\r\nAmerican makers of similar goods who “plead the baby act” to get higher\r\nprices for those goods than they otherwise would. It is compelling all\r\nthe people to pay taxes to a few of the people.\r\n\r\nQ. Why is this favor given to the few people?\r\n\r\nA. On account of the fact that they pay so much higher wages than foreign\r\nmanufacturers do and to compel them to pay still higher wages.\r\n\r\nQ. Is this necessary?\r\n\r\nA. It is very necessary to the Republican Party; for it gives it an issue\r\nand its chief cause for existence. When it saw accomplished, by the\r\nfortune of war, the freedom of the slave, what could be more natural and\r\nglorious than its ready espousal of anti-freedom for commerce?\r\n\r\nQ. Are “protective” duties always just equal to the difference between\r\nour wages and foreign wages?\r\n\r\nA. That is what our argument implies; and, if our argument is true, that\r\nis all we can ask. But how is a noble army of patriots to be maintained,\r\nand how can election expenses be met if we do not—in our tariff—treble\r\nand more than quadruple this difference often?\r\n\r\nQ. Are high wages given by our manufacturers without an equivalent\r\nadvantage in return?\r\n\r\nA. It is true of wages, as of other things—that they are ordinarily worth\r\ntheir price, so that our _high-priced_ labor is really labor of _low\r\ncost_. But it is a mighty convenient subterfuge to keep this fact out of\r\nsight and by this means hoodwink the poor laborer for his vote.\r\n\r\nQ. Do manufacturers keep a lobby at Washington for securing a tariff that\r\nmakes them pay _high_ wages and yet sell their goods at _low_ prices?\r\n\r\nA. That is what we very often say, substantially.\r\n\r\nQ. Can our manufacturers sell goods abroad?\r\n\r\nA. They do very largely over other tariff walls, and bear the expense\r\nof transportation and insurance and secure handsome profits. But the\r\nquestion is too delicate a one to enlarge upon.\r\n\r\nQ. Does Mexico have a protective tariff?\r\n\r\nA. She does. The plea for it there is that it is a defense against our\r\n_high-priced_ labor. The Mexican peons work for very _low prices_ and at\r\na more than correspondingly _high cost_. It is one of the beauties of\r\nProtection that, whether labor costs little or much, you can plead for it\r\nfor either reason.\r\n\r\nQ. Does Protection help Agriculture?\r\n\r\nA. It puts a tariff on hay, grain, potatoes, eggs, etc. Very little of\r\nany of these commodities are imported by us. When they are imported to\r\nany extent the farmers are the chief buyers, as they are of peas, beans\r\nand other seeds for planting. By paying the duty on all these things\r\nthemselves they not only feel certain there is a duty, but they have the\r\nsatisfaction of knowing they are not forgotten in the great “protective”\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\nQ. Why is Protection called the American System?\r\n\r\nA. This was the question Daniel Webster asked Henry Clay, who so named\r\nit, when they were not in accord upon the tariff. Webster was puzzled\r\nby the name, for he knew the system was European and medieval; but\r\n“American” sounds well and makes us consistent in berating foreign things\r\nand ideas.\r\n\r\nQ. How does Protection help commerce?\r\n\r\nA. Commerce is so foreign we don’t need to help it. So we let it go to\r\nthe miserable foreigners—what we permit to exist. It is really better to\r\npay the two hundred million dollars we pay them yearly to carry our goods\r\nthan to let that amount of money pervert our high and noble doctrine.\r\n\r\nQ. What is meant by having the tariff “revised by its friends”?\r\n\r\nA. That, as the English say, is a good “half-crown phrase.” But its real\r\nmeaning is to oppose revising the tariff in any way whatever. Several\r\nelections have been carried by this plea, and we are still working it\r\nfor all it is worth. Of course no one goes to have his shoes mended to a\r\nshoemaker who is in favor of their holes and lack of heels, and no one\r\nselects depredators of hen-roosts to watch chicken thieves; but we must\r\nnot defer to ordinary rules when “the noble citadel of Protection” is in\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nQ. Is it understood that to change the tariff injures business?\r\n\r\nA. We always say that, and charge to Free Trade the calamity that ensues.\r\n\r\nQ. Suppose someone tells us there has been no Free Trade, and if Free\r\nTrade existed there would be no tariff to change, and therefore no injury\r\nfrom tariff changes?\r\n\r\nA. Then is the time to look wise and say little. For our main object is\r\nto make Protection the source of all good and Free Trade the cause of all\r\nevil.\r\n\r\nQ. How did it happen that, when hides were freed from duty in 1872—and\r\neven by the McKinley bill—they were taxed under the Dingley bill?\r\n\r\nA. Well—but—let’s see. Why shouldn’t hides enjoy prosperity? It’s certain\r\nthe big cattle dealers, who use the Government pastures without cost,\r\nprofit by the duty, while we can claim it helps the farmers.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are works of art tariff?\r\n\r\nA. Not because the artists ask for Protection. They’re such curious\r\npeople that they all oppose it. So we choose to be benevolent to them in\r\nspite of their eccentric behavior.\r\n\r\nQ. What other peculiar tricks have our Protection wise men?\r\n\r\nA. A pretty good one is to say that we are not tied up to any present\r\nor definite “schedules,” but to remember constantly that, if any change\r\nis made in the tariff, it must be one that goes up and never one that\r\ngoes down. It was a great mistake for Garfield to say, “I believe in a\r\nProtection that leads to Free Trade.”\r\n\r\nQ. What is Reciprocity?\r\n\r\nA. It is—well, suppose you should build a bonfire and then pour water on\r\nit, or build a levee on the Mississippi and then punch holes through it.\r\nIt is a part of our consistent scheme. Blaine knew, and who can dispute\r\nBlaine?\r\n\r\nQ. What is Free Trade?\r\n\r\nA. It is any scale of duties for any purpose that is the least bit lower\r\nthan the Dingley bill. Everything that preceded that “bravest tariff\r\never made” is Free Trade. If some day Protection should climb to loftier\r\nheights, those who should oppose it by the lower Dingley bill would be\r\nFree Traders.\r\n\r\nHere a boy, who got surreptitiously into the class, asked this\r\nunauthorized question:\r\n\r\nQ. But you say this country has prospered under almost unbroken\r\nProtection. Now, since everything tariff-like before the Dingley bill is\r\neither Free Trade or Free Tradish, why is not all our prosperity up to\r\nthe passage of that owing to Free Trade?\r\n\r\nA. A boy cannot be expected to understand the flexibility of our\r\nnomenclature or the grandeur of a great principle. We are struggling to\r\nhelp “American Industries.” Must so little a thing as mere consistency\r\nstand between us and our friends? Boys should be seen and not heard.\r\n\r\nQ. What is meant by American Industries?\r\n\r\nA. Mainly manufactures. Of course these, and all protected interests,\r\nrepresent only from 5 to 8 per cent. of the real and total industries of\r\nthe country. But they are the ones having large capital and power—the\r\nones that can hire attorneys and maintain a lobby, and that have abundant\r\n“fat for frying” when important elections are at hand. Doesn’t “American\r\nIndustries” sound well, if you only mouth it right, and roll it from the\r\neditorial pen and the platform often enough?\r\n\r\nQ. How about the industries that are left out, or get merely nominal\r\nProtection?\r\n\r\nA. The question is quite irrelevant. What more can they ask than to live\r\nin a “protected” country and be saved from Free Trade?\r\n\r\nQ. Why do we protect woolen goods, and then de-protect manufacturers by\r\n“protecting” wool?\r\n\r\nA. For the same reason that the boy cuts off a shoestring on one end\r\nand ties the cut-off piece on the other end. It amuses the boy and very\r\nlikely helps us to get rid sooner of a foreign shoestring.\r\n\r\nQ. Mention the value of Protection to American shipping.\r\n\r\nA. It doesn’t hurt it; for, by its aid and the help of our navigation\r\nlaws, there is none to hurt. The way to have ships is first to make it\r\nimpossible for us to build them, and then give enough subsidy to make\r\nit possible. Now you see the little joker and now you don’t. Didn’t\r\nPresident Harrison almost shed tears when he hauled up the American\r\nflag on a steamer rescued from a foreign register? It isn’t possible to\r\nhave Protection and have everything, but isn’t it lovely to make things\r\nimpossible at much expense and then make them possible at more expense,\r\nand at last call in a President and have a melodramatic time about it?\r\nBesides all this, it employs money and promotes labor.\r\n\r\nQ. Does Protection make wages _high_ and goods manufactured _low_?\r\n\r\nA. That is what our philosophers maintain. Manufacturers are so anxious\r\nto exist here, and it is so necessary that we should have them, that\r\nthey must pay high for their labor and sell its product low. To avoid\r\npaying but a little for labor, and to be prevented from selling their\r\ngoods at high prices, they are even willing to maintain expensive lobbies\r\nat Washington and contribute large sums for electing Protectionists to\r\nCongress, to say nothing of “hypnotizing” doubtful or opposing senators.\r\n\r\nQ. Can the first part of the above answer be really so?\r\n\r\nA. It must be. A Protection journal had for its headlines on a Protection\r\narticle the other day the statement that for many years Protection had\r\ndone for manufacturers just this: It has made the wages they give _high_\r\nand the prices they get _low_, and so they would be splendidly off if it\r\nwere not for the shadow of that wicked Wilson bill.\r\n\r\nQ. Does prosperity then consist in enlarging your expenses and reducing\r\nyour income?\r\n\r\nA. It always does in Wonderland and Topsy-Turvydom, and under Protection.\r\n\r\nQ. But do not “protected” manufacturers import laborers?\r\n\r\nA. Manufacturers are held by us to be benevolent. Of course they import\r\nlaborers, in order that there may be more here to get the benefit of our\r\nhigher wages.\r\n\r\nQ. How about invention under Protection?\r\n\r\nA. It isn’t necessary. So long as you can run the old ramshackle\r\nmachinery, and be defended by the Government, you are saved the trouble\r\nof inventing newer and better methods. Some way might possibly be found\r\nif Yankee wit were once to be let loose, whereby we could compete with\r\nother nations in our manufactures, so that everybody would admit it, and\r\nthen what would become of Protection? Remember constantly it isn’t the\r\nwelfare of the people that is paramount; it is Protection.\r\n\r\nQ. Protection being so much more necessary than free government, free\r\nsoil, free speech, and so cherubically philanthropic when compared with\r\nthe dreadfulness of British Free Trade, the question arises, How shall\r\nwe maintain its propaganda?\r\n\r\nA. We must first of all be very careful to say that Free Trade is\r\nBritish. Of course Magna Charta, including trial by jury and many other\r\ngood things, are British too, but we mustn’t lose so good a stock\r\nargument. It is true, also, that England has prospered far more under\r\nFree Trade than she ever did under Protection. But the glorious Blaine\r\naccounted for that by saying that Free Trade might be good for England,\r\nbut it must never come here. In other words, two and two make five or six\r\nover there, but here they fail to make four.\r\n\r\nQ. What next must we do?\r\n\r\nA. As our country has been very prosperous from its commencement, and\r\nwe have had more or less Protection within that period, the best way is\r\nto say that all this has happened “under Protection.” It has happened\r\n_under_ other things, too, both good and evil, because it couldn’t\r\nhappen _over_ them. But never let us forget that it was all caused by\r\nProtection. The very slight fact that our country was most prosperous\r\nwhen we had very low revenue duties is purely accidental and irrelevant.\r\nIn Mr. Blaine’s history of his career in Congress he described the period\r\nof our greatest prosperity. But there was no election in view then, and\r\nhe was careless enough to say that this period coincided with what is\r\ncalled the period of the Free Trade tariff of 1846. It was a dreadful\r\nmistake, because the statement was altogether too true, and Protection\r\nhas no use for that which is merely true.\r\n\r\nQ. There are other arguments, are there not?\r\n\r\nA. A very decisive one is to call Free Trade a theory. For it is a theory\r\nof the Creator, who seemed to favor the idea of commerce along with\r\ncivilization. But He, of course, left something for men to find out. The\r\nChinese found out in the twelfth century that a big wall around their\r\ncountry would keep off nations that were savage and hostile; but the\r\nRepublican Party have gone the Chinese one better and have walled off\r\ntrade. No doubt some college Free Trader will ask you ironically if it is\r\nreally the man who walks on his feet who is the theorist and innovator,\r\nand if the one who walks on stilts, and who tries to get everyone else on\r\nstilts, and who thinks it is a mistake that people were not born already\r\nstilted—as nations should have been already walled—is not one. But levity\r\nlike this is what a great cause must not notice.\r\n\r\nQ. What more must be said?\r\n\r\nA. We must take pains to compare the United States with some foreign\r\ncountry. As we have already shown that everything good that has occurred\r\nhere is wholly owing to Protection, we must take some foreign country and\r\ncharge all that is bad there, such as the costly armies, the despotic\r\nor kingly rule, the dense population, the illiteracy, etcetera, to Free\r\nTrade. There are no really Free Trade countries in Europe except England,\r\nand possibly Belgium. They are protective in part. But they are foreign,\r\nand that is sufficient for the argument. Only put the excess of our\r\nbenefits over theirs to the benefit of Protection, and all will be right.\r\n\r\nQ. What shall we say about cheapness and dearness?\r\n\r\nA. Didn’t the Apostle Paul say we must be all things to all men? If we\r\ndo seem to oppose somewhat the solidarity of humanity, we meet in our\r\narguments a variety of mental difficulties. Our Apostle Harrison went\r\nfor dearness by not wanting to find a cheap coat, for fear he should\r\nfind a cheap man under it. Another Apostle thought “cheap and nasty go\r\ntogether.” At the final period of a Presidential election, however, it\r\nis better to say that Protection makes things cheap, and our editors\r\nalmost always take that cue. To be sure, if cheapness were our intention,\r\nProtection could not be established, and we could not cry out against\r\n“cheap pauper labor.” The arguments must therefore be shuffled—and cheap\r\nand dear must sometimes be taken and at other times denied. The question\r\nis more or less of a crux, but it is the beauty of the noble doctrine\r\nof Protection that all trivialities of this sort it majestically sweeps\r\naway. Not being amenable to any of the laws of human reason, it is not\r\ndisturbed by such trifles as truth and consistency.\r\n\r\nQ. But can’t we say the foreigner pays the tax?\r\n\r\nA. We certainly can and we do. But this argument needs very cautious\r\nhandling. Sometimes duties are collected through the Post-Office, when\r\nthe cat is let out of the bag and the duty comes directly to the man\r\nto whom the package is addressed. If he asks to have it charged to the\r\nforeign country his goods came from, even a Republican postmaster will\r\nsometimes laugh at him. Such perverse incidents as this are what Artemus\r\nWard might call “in-fe-lick-et-us”—very.\r\n\r\nQ. How was it when Congress removed the tax from sugar?\r\n\r\nA. Well—sugar isn’t everything. It won’t do to be too one-sided. We could\r\nnot resist telling the public then that we had removed a heavy burden\r\nfrom _its_ shoulders. We really hated to tax the foreigners so much.\r\n\r\nQ. What can be argued about the terms Protection and Free Trade?\r\n\r\nA. Argument is superfluous here. The very word Protection is an\r\nassumption that meets all our requirements. It forecloses argument and\r\nshuts off dispute. Who doesn’t wish to be “protected”? And how charming\r\nit sounds to say we are protected from burglars, from enemies and from\r\nthe horrors of trade—that is, trade with a foreigner. It must be always\r\nunderstood that if you could stand near the Canada or Mexico boundary and\r\nmake a good bargain on the other side—say, the purchase of a horse for\r\nfifty dollars less than you could purchase him in your own country—you\r\nwould inflict upon yourself and your country just so much loss. But if\r\nyou buy the horse here at a price higher by fifty dollars, or over a\r\ntariff, with the fifty dollars added, you enrich both yourself and your\r\ncountry. On this doctrine, which is our fundamental one, we must and can\r\nstake everything, and against it the frothy waves of Free Trade will beat\r\nin vain.\r\n\r\nQ. Why is not Free Trade also a felicitous term?\r\n\r\nA. Things that are in themselves good, and that are made free and\r\nabundant, are, we must admit, generally to be approved. Abundant health\r\nor abundant friendship or abundant money we have not yet thought it\r\nwise to consider objectionable. But there are exceptions to all rules.\r\nAbundant trade—or Free Trade—which is trade done voluntarily by shrewd\r\nand sane men in order to procure abundant money, is different. To have\r\nit otherwise would upset our whole system of philosophy. What was this\r\nland of the free made for, if its main purpose were not to put shackles\r\non trade? What we want is to eat our own cake and have it too; to sell\r\neverything we can to foreigners and buy nothing from them, and finally to\r\nget fat by stewing in our own juice.\r\n\r\nThe term Free Trade—to refer to the original question—is now so\r\nasphyxiated by us, by our contempt of it, that it suggests a Pandora’s\r\nbox of horrors the moment we mention it. To speak of it in this\r\ncontemptuous way is really one of our strong arguments. What we want is\r\nto scream it out as a horror, to make it a bugbear. It is like telling\r\nchildren of some dreadful bogy lying in wait for them in the dark, or\r\nlike Dr. Johnson’s experiment with the fishwoman of Billingsgate, when\r\nhe called her a hypothenuse, a triangle, a parallelopipedon, and several\r\nother mathematical things of which she had not the faintest knowledge and\r\nwhich she consequently supposed were very bad.\r\n\r\nNo, whatever else we do, let us stick to our insistent and persistent\r\nscreech against Free Trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _Monopoly; The Power Behind the Trust_\r\n\r\n                          BY JOSEPH DANA MILLER\r\n\r\n\r\nHow comes it that a power in its unimpeded operations beneficent—namely,\r\nthe force or forces of combination or co-operation—becomes under certain\r\nconditions so injurious to modern industry? Why is a union of two\r\nfactories or many factories, of two companies or many companies, a signal\r\nto the community of anticipated extortion? And why should the development\r\nof natural laws—those of combination and co-operation—provoke a public\r\ndemand for regulation, and those who avail themselves of these operations\r\nbe deemed amenable to punishment?\r\n\r\nWe may grant that a perfected combination which should succeed in\r\nforestalling any given commodity would be criminal. The law from its very\r\nbeginnings has so regarded all such attempts. It is conceivable that,\r\nunder certain conditions, a mere agreement between individuals might\r\nperfect a combination clearly within the provision of the law compelling\r\nits forcible dissolution. But this is not conceivable under modern\r\nconditions where wide distribution of capital and free labor exists. Law,\r\nindeed, may create such monopolies, which it may by popular demand be\r\ncalled upon to destroy, undoing with one hand what it has done with the\r\nother. State-created monopolies have existed often in history—as notably\r\nin the reign of Queen Elizabeth—but because these have been created\r\nby direct act they have been exceedingly unpopular. So, in periods of\r\ngreater public intelligence, and where the people exercise larger powers\r\nof government, it became necessary to accomplish the same result by\r\nindirect means, by putting into operation some general law under which\r\nmonopoly could find a shelter, and the secret sources of which could not\r\nbe so easily traced.\r\n\r\nFor, contrary to the almost universal opinion, monopoly is weak. It\r\ndemands protection. And from what does it demand protection? From the\r\nall-powerful natural law of competition. The curious Socialist notion\r\nthat competition leads to monopoly is true only in the sense that\r\nmonopoly, seeing how powerless it is when threatened by the forces of\r\ncompetition, seeks the protection of such laws as it can secure, or which\r\nalready exist, for the suppression of competition. And this brings us to\r\nthe conclusion which is unavoidable that there are no monopolies save\r\nlaw-created monopolies.[1]\r\n\r\nIf this seem a novel proposition to the reader I will ask him not to grow\r\nimpatient, for the demonstration will grow upon him as he reflects. It\r\nwill seem novel, for if true all the laws and statutes for the regulation\r\nof combinations are so much waste of time and paper and the hours of\r\nlegislatures and courts. In the acceptance of such explanation of the\r\ntrust problem must go the rejection of many proposed remedies, among\r\nthem the much-lauded one of “publicity.” While publicity is always to\r\nbe commended and sought for in public or semi-public matters, it does\r\nnot appear that laws enforcing publicity upon purely private industrial\r\ncombinations are founded upon equity. Nor is it likely that publicity\r\nwill assure us the possession of knowledge beyond what we already have\r\nthrough the work of independent investigators. Nor is it probable that\r\nenforced publicity will elicit impartial truth. This proposition is of a\r\npiece with the punitive theory in the treatment of the problem, a theory\r\nwhich has already led the people far astray. Men shrink instinctively\r\nfrom such stringent regulation, and this is a true index of the moral\r\nrelation, if we may so speak, of this problem to legislation. But because\r\nthey will not think clearly they return to the proposition of legal\r\ninterposition.\r\n\r\nAlong with the remedy of “publicity” must go all laws, existing or\r\nproposed, limiting capitalization or stock watering. Beyond the fact\r\nthat such laws would often force capitalization below the earning\r\ncapacity—which is no unfair basis of capitalization—it must be said\r\nthat the evils of stock watering are largely imaginary. It is true\r\nthat over-capitalization may conceal from the public the real extent\r\nof monopoly profits, and is for this purpose, if for no other, often\r\nresorted to. But this of itself ought to constitute no valid reason\r\nfor drastic legislation. Investors ought to be left free to take their\r\nown risks, and speculative ventures ought to be left free to fix their\r\nown capitalization, for otherwise perfectly legitimate, if largely\r\nspeculative, business interests may be made to suffer injuriously to\r\nthe interests of the community. But laying aside for the time all\r\nconsiderations of this kind, stock watering is only a symptom—a sign that\r\nmonopolistic powers, and not legitimate business interests, are being\r\ncapitalized.[2]\r\n\r\nHigh capitalization, it is sometimes said, tends to increase price. It\r\ndoes offer temptation to increase of price, but nothing can put it\r\nwithin the power of combinations to increase price save the forces of\r\nmonopoly. This power you do not increase or decrease by adding to the\r\nnumbers of the counters, the considerations governing which are purely\r\nthose of the stock-gambling fraternity.\r\n\r\nNational licensing of corporations to do business—a remedy proposed by\r\nMr. Bryan and adopted by President Roosevelt—must also be dismissed.\r\nObviously if the state has endowed corporations and armed them with\r\nletters of marque by authority of which they may prey upon commerce,\r\nit is the height of absurdity to ignore this feature of the question\r\nwith talk about licensing them. In a very real sense they are already\r\nlicensed, for it must be repeated that combinations do not create the\r\nmonopoly, but merely avail themselves of the monopolistic powers created\r\nby society through acts of Government.\r\n\r\nOf necessity all such laws must fail. This, it is scarcely necessary to\r\nsay, has been the universal experience. And from future legislation no\r\nmore is to be hoped than from past legislation, however well intentioned.\r\n\r\nThe reason why all this anti-trust legislation is futile is because,\r\nhaving created monopoly privileges, Government has appealed to the\r\nnatural instincts of all men to seek these opportunities and benefits.\r\nSuch laws are attempts to give effective form to the public’s foolish\r\nanathemas against impulses shared by everybody, and are therefore as\r\nfutile as the Pope’s bull against the comet. When we understand that\r\nthese great trusts are monopolies that Government has made, we will\r\nrealize why it is that Government cannot unmake them by any other process\r\nthan by removing the causes of their creation.[3] Books prescribing\r\nsuch anti-trust legislation may continue to cumber the libraries of our\r\nlawyers, and streams of statutes may continue to pour from the lawmaking\r\nbodies of states and Nation, but these will be either positively harmful\r\nor wholly harmless, never effective.\r\n\r\nWe are, indeed, “fooling” with natural laws, and we can do so only at our\r\nperil. The law of competition and the law of co-operation or combination\r\nare what they have often been called, the centripetal and centrifugal\r\nforces of social economics. Competition is often a painful but really a\r\nmerciful process; it weeds out the useless and the inefficient; selects\r\nunerringly its business leaders; destroys, but where it destroys builds\r\nup; rescues from the mass the individuals and processes most fitted to\r\nsurvive, and out of chaos brings order. It replaces obsolete with more\r\nperfect organization, and where such organization becomes unwieldy it\r\nreplaces organization with individuals, reverting to the earlier type of\r\nindustry. Thus the country store is succeeded by the store in which is\r\nsold but one line of goods, and this is succeeded by the mammoth type of\r\ncountry store, the great city’s department store; and the development\r\nof the last named type seems again to revert to the second—viz., a\r\ncongeries of stores in which each is distinct from the other, each\r\nattaining a reputation for competitive excellence in one line of goods,\r\nthus illustrating in the retail trade the interplay of the forces of\r\ncompetition and combination.\r\n\r\nJust as there is a limit fixed to the bounds of competition, so there\r\nis a limit to the bounds of combination. The maximum of combination\r\nand the maximum of efficiency are not the same. There is a point in\r\nthe progress of combination beyond which it does not, or would not\r\nnaturally advance—and that is when it reaches the maximum of efficiency.\r\nIt seems very likely that the element of monopoly in society today forces\r\ncombination far beyond the point of the most efficient co-operation.\r\n\r\nThese natural laws may not be “regulated.” Such laws are not for\r\nregulation, but for obedience. We may impede, we may interrupt their\r\noperation, but only to our injury. The most we can do is to regulate our\r\ninstitution by these laws, as we trim a sail to the wind and tides; we do\r\nnot attempt to “regulate” wind and tides; and these laws of co-operation\r\nand competition are of the same order—natural laws which to disobey is to\r\nbe destroyed.\r\n\r\nWe hear much superficial talk about “the wastes of competition.” The\r\nSocialists play into the hands of the trust apologists who defend them\r\non the ground that competition leads to waste. Beyond the fact that\r\ncompetition has never yet been fully tried, that it has never yet been\r\nwholly free, and that such waste as it entails is inseparable from\r\nthe natural process which weeds out the incompetent, the antedated\r\nand the unskilled—a process of which the waste is but incidental to\r\nthe conservation—is that these combinations do not seek primarily to\r\nescape the waste of competition so much as to avail themselves of those\r\nartificial laws which prevent competition from doing its perfect work.\r\n\r\nThe term expressing the opposite of competition is not combination,\r\nbut monopoly. Professor Jenks, in his work, “The Trust Problem,” falls\r\ninto this error when he speaks of combinations in the retail trade as\r\novercoming the “friction” of competition, instancing associations of\r\nhardware dealers, druggists, etc. Here, he says, we have an element\r\nof combination from which he assumes the element of competition has\r\nbeen eliminated. But his error is in the analogy he seeks to establish\r\nbetween such agreements from which the element of competition cannot be\r\nexpelled, and agreements which are based upon the control of some special\r\nprivilege created by law, and of which the great railroad and industrial\r\ntrusts are examples, and which people have in mind when they talk of the\r\n“trust problem.”\r\n\r\nClearly no monopoly exists nor can be made to exist in the retail trade.\r\nAgreements may be made, but they will be broken; and the fact that they\r\ncan be broken by isolated individuals who can thus separate themselves\r\nfrom the combination, and by their separation cause it to dissolve, is\r\nproof that the monopoly element does not exist. For the monopoly element\r\nin the possession of the great trusts is the potent weapon with which\r\nthe combinations can compel the recalcitrant member to return, or beat\r\nhim into starvation. From mere agreements in the retail trade, such\r\nas Professor Jenks instances, the primary element of monopoly being\r\nabsent, desertions are fatal, and for this reason such combinations are\r\nnever effective as means for extortion, though they do often arrest the\r\nsacrifices of keenly competing retailers. And the illicit intrusion of\r\nsuch examples is a favorite trick of the trust apologist, who, when the\r\nevils of the trust are pointed out, grows righteously indignant over\r\nthe right of men to combine—which nobody seriously disputes—or points\r\nout with superfluous wealth of illustration how combination effects the\r\ncheapening of production—which nobody ever really denies. For the same\r\nreason labor unions cannot be considered as effective monopolies—though\r\nthe trust apologist does not forget them in his special pleas—for the\r\nreason that they possess no effective legal privilege.\r\n\r\nBut to avoid a possible misunderstanding let us now answer a query which\r\nmay have risen in the mind of the reader. Is competition or combination\r\nthe beneficent law of industry? Both; for one is the complement of the\r\nother. They exist together, and together they effect the industrial\r\nprogress of the world. But monopoly is the negation of both, since\r\nfurther combination or co-operation is no longer possible where monopoly\r\nis complete. And where there is competition there will be combination,\r\nhealthy, rational, continuous, and competition will determine its\r\ndevelopment and direction. The defense of the trust based upon the\r\neconomic benefits resulting from the elimination of the unskilled is a\r\ndefense of the principle of combination present under free competition,\r\nand is in no sense a defense of monopoly of which what we know as the\r\n“trust” is the manifestation. Such discussion, together with much talk of\r\nthe wastes of competition, which helps to swell so many pretentious works\r\non the trust problem, is so much irrelevant “padding.”\r\n\r\nThat the trusts avail themselves of all possible economies in production\r\nhas often been urged in their defense. Certainly such economies are\r\nnot needed to secure a monopoly in possession, nor does it seem that\r\nthe greatest incentives to their adoption are present. The sacrifice\r\nof inventions rather than their use by these great monopolies is proof\r\nthat they do much to prevent such economies. A monopoly can be induced\r\nto accept only with difficulty improved devices which under the spur of\r\ncompetition it would gladly avail itself of. Thus in the Post-Office,\r\nwhich is a monopoly, though a Government monopoly, improvements are\r\nintroduced only with the greatest difficulty.\r\n\r\nIf combination can of itself effect monopoly, why are huge sums set\r\naside by these great corporations to influence legislation? Why are\r\ncontributions made to the campaign funds of the two great parties? Is\r\nit not because these combinations seek to perpetuate their monopolistic\r\nprivileges? It may be said that it is contributed to effect the defeat\r\nof “strike bills.” But what would a business partnership, not in some\r\nway dependent upon previously existing legislation, care about “strike\r\nbills”? Why does the American Sugar Refining Company (according to the\r\ntestimony of Mr. Havemeyer) contribute in some states to the Republican\r\ncampaign fund, and in other states to the Democratic campaign fund?\r\n\r\nAs an example of the kind of defense urged by the trust apologists here\r\nis a work entitled, “The Trust; Its Book,” containing articles from\r\nthe pens of Charles R. Flint, James J. Hill, S. C. T. Dodd, Francis B.\r\nThurber, and others. It is a plea of “confession and avoidance.” The\r\nauthors fight shy of even the hated term monopoly, and content themselves\r\nwith defending the right of combination. Not one of them appears to\r\nthink that the popular outcry against trusts is founded on anything but\r\nutter ignorance; and they therefore devote themselves to showing the\r\nadvantages of large scale production—as if that were the question. All\r\nthis seems purely disingenuous. It is hardly conceivable that men who\r\nknow so well the effects of monopoly, who know how potent has been the\r\nuse by combination of existing laws securing the possession of special\r\nprivileges, should write this way from any other motive than to becloud\r\nthe issue. We can acquit them of intentional deception far less readily\r\nthan the professors of political economy. The latter may be at once\r\nexonerated, since it is incredible that men who have become involved in\r\nthe self-created subtleties of modern economics should retain sufficient\r\nclearness of comprehension to see anything in its proper relation.\r\n\r\nIf it be true that there are no monopolies save law-created monopolies,\r\nit only remains for the state to undo the work it has done. The means by\r\nwhich the state, consciously or unconsciously, has fostered monopolies\r\nmay be removed, and a new, and up to this time untried, method for\r\nremedying the evils of trusts be set in motion.\r\n\r\nBefore we can agree to this, however, we must understand what monopoly\r\nis. Briefly stated, it is the power to charge more than a competitive\r\nprice for a commodity or service. This power can be permanently secured\r\nby the favor of Government, and in no other way. An agreement between\r\nindividuals cannot accomplish it, since such agreements, even if they\r\ninclude all individuals in interest, which is impossible, or at all\r\nevents inconceivable, would infallibly be broken. The only way such\r\nagreements may be made effective is for Government to make powerless, or\r\nnearly so, the potential competitive elements or individuals in interest.\r\nThis it does in several ways, or to be explicit, chiefly in three ways.\r\n\r\nBy Land Laws,\r\n\r\nTax Laws,\r\n\r\nLaws Regulating (or that fail to regulate) the use of the steam highways\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\nI know of no other source of monopoly unless it be our patent laws. But\r\nthese being—originally at least—rewards of invention, the injury results\r\nfrom their misuse.[4] Even the misuse of patent laws is not one of the\r\nchief potent influences in the perpetuation of monopoly. But without, in\r\nmost cases, adding to the power of monopoly, which derives its strength\r\nfrom other causes, it puts in the hands of the great combinations the\r\npower to arrest progress. The value to society of an invention is in\r\nits use. Under present misuse of patents, inventions are held out of\r\nuse and are often bought up and destroyed for the purpose of depriving\r\ncompetitors of the use of like improvements, or because such inventions\r\nwould often reduce the machinery in present use to the value of old iron.\r\nClearly, if industrial progress is to be made to yield its full results,\r\nsome change in our patent laws is imperatively called for. Were the law\r\nof competition allowed to work freely, the use of such inventions,\r\neven under present patent laws, would be determined largely by the law\r\nof self-preservation. For the sources we have indicated are also the\r\nsources to a degree of the patent monopoly. In a competitive market for\r\nthe use of an invention the inventor would be less likely to part with\r\nhis invention, even under the present patent system. Where the bidding is\r\nartificially restricted the inventor sells at a disadvantage. Monopoly\r\nhas the inventor at its mercy. But however this may be, nothing less than\r\nthe free use of an invention to everyone willing to pay a royalty to the\r\ninventor for its use will do justice to the inventor and meet, at the\r\nsame time, the interests of the great public and the necessary demands of\r\nindustrial progress.\r\n\r\nCertain superficial economists, misled by recent manifestations in trust\r\nbuilding, have hastily concluded that the problem it presents is a new\r\none. For example, Collier, in his work on the subject, says: “The problem\r\nof the trusts is a momentous one, yet it is unqualifiedly a new one.”\r\nOf course it is not new. It is the same old problem of monopoly, and\r\nthe so-called trust problem is but a phase of it. It is the problem of\r\nmonopoly crystallized. The evils of the trust rivet the public attention,\r\nnot because they are more real than the evils of monopoly _per se_, but\r\nbecause they are more obvious. In some respects the trust, by combining\r\ncertain elements of monopoly, tends to make monopoly more perfect and\r\nits operations more harmful. But it simply avails itself of monopolistic\r\ninstitutions—that is to say, it is built upon land, railroad or tax\r\nmonopoly; it takes to itself certain privileges which society has created\r\nand which have hitherto been appropriated and exercised by individuals.\r\nIt therefore immediately makes these evils concrete. The trust is thus\r\na manifestation, and the people, with their customary thoughtlessness,\r\nattack the manifestation rather than the thing itself—the fruit of\r\nmonopoly rather than the tree.\r\n\r\nThe great combinations which suggest themselves when we think of the\r\ntrust problem—is there one of them which does not owe its existence to\r\nsome monopoly privilege? What would the Standard Oil Company be but for\r\nits control of rights of way, sources of supply, railroad terminals and\r\nthe preferential benefits it is enabled to secure? What is the Steel\r\nTrust but a network of artificial privilege? Has not Mr. Charles E.\r\nRussell clearly shown, in his recent articles in _Everybody’s Magazine_,\r\nthat the Beef Trust draws its life-blood from its monopolization of\r\nrailroad privileges? What would the Sugar Trust be without the favors\r\nit receives from the tariff in its control of the raw material? Could\r\nthe Tobacco Trust exist save for the power of taxation which strangles\r\ncompetition?\r\n\r\nThose mentioned include nearly all the greater trusts. A more detailed\r\ndemonstration of the truth we are insisting upon could be given, but the\r\nreader can himself carry this line of analysis further. He will find that\r\nit explains the existence of every oppressive combination, and that it\r\nleaves little unresolved or unexplained. It may happen that injurious\r\ncombinations will present themselves in which this element of monopoly\r\ndoes not clearly appear. But these are by-monopolies, so to speak, and\r\ntheir sources of power may be traced to indirect association with the\r\ngiant monopolies.\r\n\r\nLet us admit all the good there is in aggregated capital. Let us take the\r\ntrust advocates at their word that industry should be left free of all\r\nmeddling, repressive or restrictive legislation. Is there, then, a common\r\nground upon which we can meet? To think so is to delude ourselves. For\r\ntheir objection is not so much to mischievous laws of this sort as to\r\ninterferences with things as they are. Their plea for _laissez faire_ is\r\nhollow and insincere; true _laissez faire_ would render every combination\r\nof capital innocuous for evil; there would be no mammoth aggregations of\r\nwealth in the hands of single individuals and no plethoric incomes.\r\n\r\nThe law of competition, let the Socialists prate as they will, gives\r\nonly to those who earn. But from the denial of this law (of competition)\r\nflows all existing inequality in the distribution of wealth. There are,\r\nit is true, great swollen fortunes, which seem unconnected with these\r\nartificial laws of monopoly. Some of these, while clearly not the result\r\nof greater enterprise or greater ability, seem to be due to cunningly\r\narranged devices independent of existing monopoly laws. But this is so\r\nin appearance only. There are no such made-to-order arrangements of\r\nindustrial combination that can be used for extortion. Competition is\r\ntoo keenly scrutinizing for such arrangements to go undetected. The\r\ninevitable day when imitation shall overtake them can only be permanently\r\npostponed by seeking the shelter of monopoly.\r\n\r\nSome of these gigantic fortunes are the result of stock speculation. But\r\nthese are incidental, and are the profits and losses of the gambling\r\nfraternity—a game really played with the counters of monopoly, like\r\n“chips” in a poker game, and the transference of which from one to\r\nanother enriches or depletes the finances only of those who play. They\r\ndo not concern the man who refrains from taking part in the game, and\r\nwhether it be played with railroad stocks or industrials is no great\r\nmatter. If these gamblers sometimes use the moneys on deposit in public\r\ninstitutions—as Mr. Lawson has asserted they do—that also is another\r\nquestion, though a momentous one.\r\n\r\nWith the dissolving of these giant combinations which would result from\r\nthe removal of the laws of monopoly would disappear the great host of\r\ngamblers and stock jugglers. The great fortunes that result from the\r\ngranting of legislative favors would also disappear, since there would be\r\nno longer any legislative favors to grant. And so with many other unjust\r\npossessions. And with them would be banished forever much that corrupts\r\nour social and political life.\r\n\r\n[1] In his definition of a trust Mr. John Moody, author of the “Truth\r\nAbout Trusts,” says: “When men form corporate organizations, or make\r\nagreements, they do not form monopolies. They may take advantage of\r\nmonopoly in one way or another, but they do not create it. The monopoly\r\nitself is a social product, which exists with the consent of society,\r\nand men in business take advantage of it where found, just as they take\r\nadvantage of other factors for the purpose of achieving their ends.”\r\n\r\n[2] Charles M. Schwab, in his testimony before the Industrial Commission\r\nat Washington in excuse of the apparently excessive capitalization of the\r\nSteel Trust, estimated as the approximate valuation of plants, mills,\r\nmachinery and transportation properties the sum of $380,000,000, but the\r\nvalue of the ore, coal, natural gas and limestone properties he put at\r\nthe enormous sum of $1,100,000,000.\r\n\r\n[3] This is vaguely recognized by the trust advocates and those who have\r\nwritten on the subject. Professor Jenks, who is one of the most temperate\r\nand discriminating, says: “So far as the industrial combinations are the\r\nresult of special advantages granted to individuals or corporations,\r\nwhether by the state or by others, it is probable that in most instances\r\nthe evil effects would be lessened, if not completely removed, by the\r\nremoval of such discriminating powers.” Which is barely more than an\r\ninvolved method of stating that the removal of a cause will also result\r\nin removing the effect.\r\n\r\n[4] Undoubtedly the control of patents is an effective source of monopoly\r\nin very many instances. Some of the large combinations have succeeded in\r\nobtaining control practically of all the patents used in certain lines of\r\nmanufacture. That this is a potent source of power one instance alone may\r\nsuffice to prove. Professor Jenks tells us that all of the barbed wire\r\nmade in this country at the present time, as well as the wire fencing, is\r\nin the hands of the American Steel and Wire Company because that company\r\nhas all the valuable patents, with one or two exceptions, in those lines\r\nof manufacturing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _The Heritage of Maxwell Fair_\r\n\r\n                            BY VINCENT HARPER\r\n                  _Author of “A Mortgage on the Brain”_\r\n\r\n                             (_Conclusion_)\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SYNOPSIS OF PREVIOUS CHAPTERS\r\n\r\n        Maxwell Fair, an Englishman who has amassed a colossal\r\n      fortune on ’Change, inherits from his ancestors a remarkable\r\n      tendency to devote his life to some object, generally a\r\n      worthy, if peculiar one, which is extravagantly chivalrous.\r\n      The story opens with Fair and Mrs. Fair standing over the\r\n      body of a man who has just been shot in their house—a\r\n      foreigner, who had claimed to be an old friend of Mrs. Fair.\r\n      Fair sends her to her room, saying: “Leave everything to me.”\r\n      He hides the body in a chest, and decides to close the house\r\n      “for a trip on the Continent.” Fair tells the governess, Kate\r\n      Mettleby, that he loves her; that there is no dishonor in\r\n      his love, in spite of Mrs. Fair’s existence, and that, until\r\n      an hour ago, he thought he could marry her—could “break the\r\n      self-imposed conditions of his weird life-purpose.” They\r\n      are interrupted before Kate, who really loves him, is made\r\n      to understand. While the Fairs are entertaining a few old\r\n      friends at dinner, Kate, not knowing that it contains Mrs.\r\n      Fair’s blood-stained dress, is about to hide a parcel in the\r\n      chest when she is startled by the entrance of Samuel Ferret,\r\n      a detective from Scotland Yard. He tells her that he, with\r\n      other detectives, is shadowing the foreign gentleman who\r\n      came to the Fair house that day and has not yet left it. He\r\n      persuades Kate to promise that she will follow the suspect\r\n      when he leaves the house and then report at Scotland Yard.\r\n      As soon as Ferret is gone she lifts the lid off the chest,\r\n      drops the package into it, and, with a shriek, falls fainting\r\n      to the floor. Mr. and Mrs. Fair run to her aid. On being\r\n      revived Kate goes to Scotland Yard, where, in her anxiety to\r\n      shield Maxwell Fair from suspicion, she inadvertently leads\r\n      the detectives to think that a crime has been committed at\r\n      the Fair house. The two detectives are piecing together the\r\n      real facts from the clues she has given, when Ferret is\r\n      summoned to the telephone by his associate, Wilson, whom he\r\n      had left on guard in the home of the Fairs. Fair tells Sir\r\n      Nelson Poynter, at the latter’s country place, that he has\r\n      committed some crime, and explains that Mrs. Fair is not his\r\n      wife—that a Cuban scoundrel had married her, already having\r\n      a wife, and deserted her, and that he, Fair, had brought her\r\n      and her children to England, giving her his name before the\r\n      world, yet being her husband in name only. Sir Nelson and\r\n      Fair’s other friends, Allyne and Travers, begin to suspect\r\n      his sanity.\r\n\r\n“But what is the ridiculous idea that has turned your head? What sort of\r\nidiotic crime would you ask us to believe that you have committed? Come,\r\nsir, out with it—what’s the charge against this villainous man?” asked\r\nSir Nelson, with equal certainty and confidence.\r\n\r\n“Only a trifle,” answered Fair. “Just a quiet little—murder!”\r\n\r\n“That settles it,” shouted the good old fellow, thumping his knee with\r\nhis clenched fist. “That settles it, sir. Sir Porter will have you in a\r\nstraitjacket before night. Murder, eh? You burglar, forger, pirate—you!”\r\n\r\nFair waited until Sir Nelson had had his laugh, and then said with\r\nirritating persistency: “Quite another sort of jacket, I think, sir.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll see, we’ll see,” retorted Sir Nelson, and then, abruptly changing\r\nthe subject and his own expression, “but, I say, Fair, why have you never\r\nmarried Janet? She was, of course, free?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t wonder at the question,” Fair replied, relieved at the change.\r\n“That of course was the first question which presented itself to my\r\nmind. But by the time that Janet came back into my life the old love had\r\npassed away—or perhaps I should put it another way—the love I now found\r\nmyself bearing for her was of a different sort. I am a Fair, you know,\r\nSir Nelson, and destiny demanded that the passion of my life be not like\r\nthose of ordinary men. So Janet seemed to come to me not as a woman whom\r\nI might think of as a wife, but as a holy, consecrated, crucifying Idea\r\nwhich fate had destined should be the ‘Fair Folly’ of this generation. I\r\nthink you know that each generation in our family has had its ‘folly.’”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered Sir Nelson, shaking his head and letting his mind run\r\nback to the follies of the two generations of Fairs that he had known.\r\n“But your folly, my poor boy, has been so above the world’s standards\r\nof rational conduct that it is madness in our earthly eyes—or, perhaps,\r\nit is like the ‘foolishness of the saints,’ of which Saint Paul talks.\r\nBut now, old hero—or madman—for reason’s sake, tell me of this accursed\r\nhallucination of yours—this blooming murder, you know. Have you killed\r\nthe Pope or the Czar of Russia or Napoleon Bonaparte?”\r\n\r\n“I appreciate your inability to accept the truth,” replied Fair. “But you\r\nmust do so when I have told you all. You see, I have murdered so seldom\r\nthat I was forgetting to tell you the details. Well, Sir Nelson, the\r\nrascal whom I——”\r\n\r\nHe was cut short by the sudden and alarming appearance of Kate Mettleby,\r\nwho came running upon the terrace in traveling dress and quite out\r\nof breath. Both of the men rose and Sir Nelson watched Fair’s face\r\nwith ill-disguised concern, which rapidly increased as Fair’s usual\r\nself-control gave place to evident uncontrollable nervousness and\r\nfeverish excitement.\r\n\r\n“Oh—Mr.—Fair,” gasped Kate, trying to get her breath; “thank God, you are\r\nhere! I was—afraid—that”——\r\n\r\n“Miss Mettleby,” interrupted Fair, advancing to meet her, “I supposed\r\nthat you were halfway to Paris by this time. What has happened? You look\r\nill.”\r\n\r\n“Pardon me, sir,” answered Kate, “but—I’m out of breath—I ran.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mind letting me see this young lady alone, Sir Nelson?” asked\r\nFair, noticing that Sir Nelson stood, dazed and troubled, watching them.\r\n\r\n“No, no—by all means,” quickly responded the old man eagerly. “I just\r\nwanted to see if she would not go in and refresh herself first. Allow me\r\nto advise Lady Poynter. The poor girl seems regularly done.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, thank you, no, sir,” put in Kate, waving a protest; “I can stop only\r\na moment. I must return to town on the next train, sir.”\r\n\r\n“But you really can’t, you know,” said Sir Nelson. “You really must not\r\nthink of returning without luncheon—it’s about ready, you know. I shall\r\nadvise Lady Poynter that you are come,” and he hurried off.\r\n\r\n“Well?” asked Fair when Kate looked up at him. “Tell me, Kate—and tell\r\nme quickly and without hesitation, for nothing can shock me now. So the\r\nworst of it—all of it—at once!”\r\n\r\n“Where is Mrs. Fair?” Kate asked, with a look which begged piteously that\r\nthe reply to her question be what she hoped. “She is here? Say that she\r\nis here!”\r\n\r\n“Here?” cried out Fair, now thoroughly alarmed, a certain suspicion that\r\nhad been gathering force shaping itself into something like certainty in\r\nhis mind. “Here. Did she not start for Paris with you and the children?\r\nWhat can you mean?”\r\n\r\nKate struggled with the dreadful fears that were choking her.\r\n\r\n“We all left the house together in the carriage and drove to the\r\nrailway station, but there Mrs. Fair said that she wished to drive to a\r\nchemist’s shop, and we were to wait for her speedy return. She went off\r\naccordingly, and about twenty minutes later the carriage came back and\r\nJohn fetched this letter from Mrs. Fair to me. Take it and read it—it\r\nsays that she desired me to take the children to Mrs. Barrington’s, and\r\nannounced that she would communicate her change of plans to you. Oh, Mr.\r\nFair, what does it all mean? I can bear little more of this suspense!”\r\n\r\n“Poor old Janet!” groaned Fair, taking but not reading the letter which\r\nKate handed to him. He walked up and down for a few seconds, then coming\r\nback to Kate said: “I see. I see it now. My God, what a woman! Wait here,\r\ndear, until I consult Sir Nelson, for we’ve got to act with life for the\r\nspur. This is a race, Kate—the maddest ever run!”\r\n\r\n“But, Mr. Fair—Maxwell,” complained Kate, “tell me what it all means! I\r\nknow about—that horror, you know, in the chest. I saw it. But no harm\r\nshall come to you, Maxwell, for I told them at Scotland Yard that it was\r\nnot you—and they told me that they believed me.”\r\n\r\nFair jumped forward and could not believe what he heard, but the triumph\r\non her poor little agonized face showed only too clearly that what she\r\nsaid was true.\r\n\r\n“Scotland Yard?” he finally cried out. “Are you mad?” Then with a wild\r\nhysterical laugh that chilled her, he added: “So you kindly assured them\r\nthat I was innocent, did you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she answered, failing to note the irony in his laugh, and\r\nconscious only of the loftiness of her motive. “Yes, for it would have\r\nbroken my heart had they even whispered your name. Tell me! tell me! What\r\nis it? Whose body is that in the accursed chest? My mind is going—I can\r\nbear no more! Maxwell, I love you—I love you!”\r\n\r\n“My poor little girl,” he said pityingly, looking down at her; “my Kate!\r\nWe will talk it all over on our way to town—for I shall go back with you.\r\nOnly you must be brave now. Remember that what I did with my hand I did\r\nnot do with my heart, will you? My hand killed him; not my mind nor my\r\nwill. Believe that, will you not, darling?”\r\n\r\n“I will believe neither,” she cried bitterly. “You did not! you did not!”\r\n\r\n“Hush!—they will hear you,” warned Fair, adding more gently: “Now wait\r\nhere and say nothing to anyone. I will return at once—and we will catch\r\nthe next train for town. Poor, poor Janet—good God, what work!”\r\n\r\nHe dashed into the house, and Kate sat as if dreaming on the garden seat.\r\nAfter trying to collect her thoughts and to fathom the deepening mystery\r\nwhich was overwhelming her, she suddenly caught sight of the torn letter\r\nwhich Mrs. March had dropped upon the seat. Acting mechanically and\r\nscarcely knowing what she was doing or that she was doing anything at\r\nall, she glanced at the piece of the letter which she had chanced to pick\r\nup—and at once her mind was awake. There was a name—a name and an address\r\nthat startled her by their seeming incomprehensible coincidence with her\r\nthoughts at the moment. Hearing voices approaching before she had fully\r\ntaken in the meaning of this new bit of perplexing tangle, she thrust\r\nthe scrap of paper into her pocket. The next instant she saw Fair coming\r\nout of the door, carrying his portmanteau. At his side was Mrs. March.\r\n\r\n“I am so sorry,” Mrs. March was saying as they came up to her. “You have\r\nyour bag—which means that you are not waiting for luncheon. Must you\r\nreally rush off in this way? I wanted to speak to you ever so much.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” Fair replied, putting down the bag and consulting a time-table;\r\n“awfully sorry, but I have just heard that Mrs. Fair was unable to\r\nproceed to Paris this morning, and, of course, I shall be very anxious\r\nuntil I see her and learn the cause. I think you have met Miss Mettleby,\r\nMrs. March?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, how do you do?” smiled Mrs. March, giving Kate a warm hand grasp.\r\n\r\n“Good morning, Mrs. March,” responded Kate, and then to Fair: “I think,\r\nif you don’t mind, sir, I’ll go along through the park by myself. We have\r\nsome time, I think, before the train is due. Good morning.”\r\n\r\n“Do,” urged Fair, and when Kate had disappeared he turned to Mrs. March\r\nnot very cheerfully: “You wished to confess something or other to me?\r\nDo, if you love me, make it something uproariously funny—or else choose\r\nanother father confessor. I’m a bit edgy this morning, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I’m sure you will think it the merriest news,” replied Mrs. March,\r\nwith beaming good nature. “Maxwell—I’m married!”\r\n\r\nFair looked at her, stupefied. One expression followed another on his\r\nface, and then, when he had secured his usual genial expression, he said:\r\n“Not really? Well, all I can say is—one man is happy. But explain.”\r\n\r\n“Wasn’t it just like me to slip over to Brussels and be married quietly?\r\nYou know I hate the regulation fuss. And heaven has given me the love of\r\na man whom I am sure you will love and respect when you know him. All\r\nheart and soul and honor—a knight and a poet.”\r\n\r\n“Believe me, my dear friend,” answered Fair, “I wish you all the\r\nhappiness that your good heart deserves. When may we congratulate you in\r\na public manner? And what are we to call you henceforth?”\r\n\r\n“It will seem strange to call me by my new name, won’t it—and a foreign\r\nname, too? My husband’s name is Don Pablo Mendes, formerly of Santiago de\r\nCuba,” said Mrs. March, with a flush of happiness which blanched out and\r\nbecame the pallor of horror as she saw the effect on Fair.\r\n\r\nHe dropped the portmanteau, which he had picked up, stared as if stunned\r\nfor a moment, and then with a tremendous effort to spare the wretched\r\nwoman as long as possible, he said huskily: “I beg your pardon—the fact\r\nis, I am far from well—Good-bye!”\r\n\r\n“I’m so sorry,” returned Mrs. March, satisfied that his singular conduct\r\nwas really the result of a bad turn. “But tell me before you go,\r\nMaxwell—do you know my dear Spanish boy?”\r\n\r\n“I can’t say that I do,” he stammered; “but really I shall miss my\r\ntrain—good-bye,” and before she could ask him anything more he was\r\nstriding across the park.\r\n\r\n“What strange behavior!” she said to herself as she watched him. “Maxwell\r\nof all men, too! The mirror of good form—and the one man who never fails\r\nto say the right thing at the right time. Ah, here he comes back to make\r\nthe proper amends. Back so soon?” she asked as Fair rejoined her with his\r\nhat in his hand. “Forget something—or did you, like a good fellow, come\r\nback to say just one kind word?”\r\n\r\n“Mrs. March,” he began, speaking with strange dignity and pain. “I have\r\ncome back to implore your pardon. I lied to you. We shall never see each\r\nother again, and it was dastardly in me to try to shield myself from the\r\nhorrible duty which as one of your oldest friends I owe you—the last\r\nthing, also, that I can ever do for you. You are a true woman and a great\r\nsoul. Be great enough to face what I have now to tell you. I do know\r\nPablo Mendes—and if you have not told any of your friends about your\r\nunspeakably deplorable marriage, for God’s sake do not tell them. You\r\nwill understand why I say this, and bless me for saying it soon—you will\r\nthank me until your dying day. Your secret is, of course, sacred with me.\r\nMrs. March, brace yourself now—life is a battle for us all—and victory\r\nis not for them that fight, but for them that bear—so hear me. You will\r\nnever see your husband again. Give me your hand—so—are you ill? Courage\r\nnow for a moment. Mendes is dead. I—Somebody, in there! Quick! Mrs. March\r\nhas fainted!”\r\n\r\nNot waiting to help carry her in, he bade Baggs tell Mr. Allyne and\r\nMr. Travers to join him in town at once, and seeing that servants were\r\nalready gone to fetch Lady Poynter, he sped along the avenue to overtake\r\nMiss Mettleby, whose skirts he saw through the shrubbery at some distance\r\nfrom the terrace. In ten minutes they were aboard the train.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nAt about eight o’clock that evening Fair, who had dined with Allyne and\r\nTravers at the club, reached his own door and, letting himself in, waited\r\nfor their arrival in the small smoking-room on the first floor of the\r\ndeserted and gloomy mansion. As he opened the street door he thought\r\nthat he heard hasty footsteps on one of the upper stories, but soon he\r\nwas able to rid himself of the unpleasant fancy, and sat quietly reading\r\nuntil his friends should come.\r\n\r\nThis they did in a very few minutes—considerably to his relief—and the\r\nthree groped their way up the dark stairs and along the passage to\r\nthe library, which room Fair told them was to be the scene of their\r\nconference. As they peered in at the door the black woodwork of the\r\nlibrary made the gloom seem greater than in the passage, and as they\r\nhesitated Fair said: “Strike a match, will you, Travers?”\r\n\r\n“Right you are—if I don’t break my neck first,” answered Travers,\r\nfinally managing to get the match lighted and holding it high over his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n“There we are,” said Fair. “Now I can find the electric light key.”\r\n\r\nHe found it and turned on the current, flooding the room with light.\r\nThe sudden translation from total darkness to brilliant light, and the\r\ngeneral feeling of mystery and stealth with which the house seemed to be\r\nfilled, gave all of the men an uncomfortable sense of being engaged upon\r\nuncanny business.\r\n\r\n“I feel like a cross between a burglar and a blooming ass,” said Allyne,\r\nto break the unbearable silence. “By Jove, Fair, my wealth is at your\r\ndisposal, but I’ll be hanged if you can borrow much more of my nervous\r\nenergy! What’s the beastly game, anyhow?”\r\n\r\n“I do think,” added Travers, more seriously, “that we’ve followed you in\r\nthe dark about as long as a decent regard for our feelings—as well as for\r\nyour own interests—will permit. Seriously, old chap, I do not think we\r\nshould allow you to go on in this way. Elucidate, like a good fellow.”\r\n\r\n“On my honor, Dick,” replied Fair, speaking with great earnestness, “this\r\nis no fool’s errand that I have asked you and Allyne to undertake. It\r\nis the last favor that I shall ever ask you to do me. Sit down. I’ll go\r\ndownstairs and see if I can’t scare up something to drink.”\r\n\r\n“That’s the first rational thing you’ve said since yesterday,” said\r\nAllyne. “Go, by all means, old man, and make it brandy and soda.”\r\n\r\n“Back in a moment,” answered Fair, disappearing.\r\n\r\n“Honestly, Travers, what do you make of it?” asked Allyne when they were\r\nalone. “If it’s a joke he has carried it rather far. What is it?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Lord, I don’t know,” replied Travers wearily and with very genuine\r\nanxiety. “If it were any other man—but Fair is the coolest and sanest\r\ndevil I ever knew. I don’t like this turn of affairs on my word. Money\r\nand women are the only two things that could bowl a chap over on his beam\r\nends in this way, and Fair can show a clean slate under both of those\r\nheads—so I give it up. But I, for one, go no further.”\r\n\r\n“Unless I am mistaken, his father or grandfather was mad,” whispered\r\nAllyne, pursing up his lips uncomfortingly; “but I never thought Maxwell\r\ndippy—that is, you know, not unusually so. He is devilish queer.”\r\n\r\n“In England,” answered Travers, with a sneer, “everyone is thought mad\r\nwho manifests any trace of originality. In the city they think Fair a\r\nbit off his head because he does everything that sacred British methods\r\ndecry—and grows rich at it. And in society they think him singular\r\nbecause he has such a childish way of telling the truth. You and I know\r\nthat he makes friends in society just as he makes money in the city. No,\r\nI don’t think Fair is mad—I wish to heaven I could think so.”\r\n\r\nAllyne was striding up and down the room by this time, and when he next\r\nreached Travers he stopped and said: “Confound it, Travers, he can’t have\r\ndone anything so rum as all this melodramatic rot would make one think.\r\nGive him credit for too good taste for that, at least.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, never fear,” replied Travers, rising; “I’ve made up my mind. I’ll\r\ngive him half an hour more. If he does not chuck this mystery and give\r\nus the key in plain English, I’ll report the case to his solicitor and\r\nmedical man.”\r\n\r\n“Here, too,” grunted Allyne, with a nervous shrug of his shoulders. “What\r\na creepy, deuced idiotic thing to bring us up here tonight! The house\r\nfeels like a tomb! By George, I wouldn’t stop here alone for the world.\r\nDid you see that man across the way when we came in? He watched us as if\r\nwe were a gang of coiners. Lord! If they were to— What was that?”\r\n\r\nTravers, also, had heard the noise, whatever it was, and both men turned\r\nnervously toward the door and listened. It was repeated, but faintly.\r\n\r\n“It sounded like footsteps on the floor above,” said Travers.\r\n\r\n“But Fair said there is nobody in the house,” answered Allyne, adding,\r\nwith a return of his usual spirits: “I say, Travers, just run upstairs\r\nand have a look round, will you, that’s a good fellow?”\r\n\r\n“You go,” replied Travers, smiling, but more in earnest than he would\r\nhave cared to admit. “You are younger than I, and—but here’s Fair.”\r\n\r\nFair came in, carrying a tray on which were a number of decanters and\r\nglasses, which he placed on the table before he saw with surprise that\r\nthe others were evidently acting under a strain of some sort.\r\n\r\n“I say, old man, were you upstairs a moment ago?” asked Travers, with a\r\ndisquietingly anxious look.\r\n\r\n“Upstairs?” asked Fair, with growing uneasiness. “Why, no. I was\r\nbelow—ever since I left you. Why?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” answered Travers, trying to throw a careless tone into his\r\nwords. “Allyne thought he heard—There it is again!”\r\n\r\nAll three had heard it this time—and all belied with their eyes the smile\r\nwhich they forced to their lips.\r\n\r\n“Wind in the chimney,” muttered Fair, disavowing all belief in his own\r\nwords by going, not to the fireplace, but to the door to listen. “There\r\nis nobody in the house, anyway,” he added, still listening at the door.\r\n\r\n“It sounded like bare feet—Ugh—give us a drop of brandy,” growled Allyne,\r\npretending to more alarm than he really felt.\r\n\r\nFair returned to the table after closing the door into the passage, and\r\npouring a stiff drink for each of them, said, with a laugh: “Here you\r\ngo. That will hearten you up a bit, Allyne. Why, you look as though\r\nyou expected to see a ghost. Never fear, old chap. Something much more\r\nsubstantial than spirits is at the bottom of this cheerful occasion.”\r\n\r\n“There was a beastly sly fellow over the way when we came in,” said\r\nAllyne as he sat on the end of the table to drink. “Why the deuce did he\r\nwatch us like that?”\r\n\r\n“He probably wants me,” answered Fair seriously, “although he does not\r\nyet know that it is I he wants. We can ask him to escort me to jail as we\r\ngo out of the house presently.”\r\n\r\nTravers put down his glass with a bang, spilling the liquor, jumped up\r\nand swung around at Fair, thoroughly disgusted and exasperated.\r\n\r\n“Really, Fair,” he began, “I’ve had about enough of this. Aren’t you\r\npressing your little joke a bit too far? I was just saying to Allyne that\r\nI would give you half an hour. At the end of that time I——”\r\n\r\nAgain there was the sound of footsteps above their heads, and Travers\r\nstopped and all three looked toward the door as the steps seemed to come\r\ndown the stairs. Fair was the first to regain composure.\r\n\r\n“You give me half an hour,” he said to Travers, “but I shall require only\r\nten minutes. Have a cigar, and—damn it, Allyne, let up, you know. Lock\r\nthe door if you like, but for heaven’s sake quit your funk.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks awfully,” retorted Allyne, locking the door so quickly that Fair\r\nand Travers laughed genuinely this time. “There! Now we are cozy, aren’t\r\nwe just? A corpse and an undertaker and a hangman are all we want to\r\ncomplete our merry little party.”\r\n\r\n“Shut up, Allyne!” shouted Travers, watching Fair’s face. “Now, Fair, for\r\nthe love of sanity—what’s the answer?”\r\n\r\nFair poured out another drink for himself, and pushing the bottles toward\r\nTravers, threw himself full length upon a lounge. Puffing slowly at his\r\nfresh cigar, he began speaking with perfect composure:\r\n\r\n“You fellows remember a Cuban by the name of Mendes—the man of whom I\r\nhave often spoken to you, do you not? You know—Don Pablo Mendes—a great\r\nchess player?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly—you spoke of him only yesterday. Friend of Lopez? Yes—well,\r\nwhat of him?” asked Travers, and Fair turned his head toward Allyne, who\r\nseemed to be listening for noises and not to him.\r\n\r\n“I saw you speak to him one night at the opera,” said Allyne, without\r\ntaking his eyes from the door. “Looked like a twin brother of the\r\ndevil—diamonds, yellow fingers, hair oil, et cetera. Proceed, to wit, go\r\non.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that’s the man,” answered Fair, and then leaning over to flick the\r\nashes from his cigar into the hearth, he added, without the slightest\r\nexcitement or emotion: “Well—I murdered him yesterday, you know.”\r\n\r\n“You are drunk,” sweetly remarked Travers, with a look of infinite\r\nrelief, as of course Fair now was admitting that he had been twigging\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“Murdered him, eh?” grunted Allyne, executing a series of maneuvres that\r\nlanded him on Fair’s chest. “Murdered a yellow cigarette twister, did\r\nyou? What of that? Why, I strangled my grandmother last night.”\r\n\r\n“By all that is holy,” Fair cried out hoarsely, “gentlemen, you sha’n’t\r\ngo on in this way. If you will only allow me to tell my story, you will\r\nrealize that I am a ruined man with death hanging over me, and, as my\r\nfriends, I ask you to stand by me, to see that I face my fate and end my\r\nlife in a way to prove that I was not altogether unworthy of two such\r\nfriends. Will you do this?”\r\n\r\nHe turned his white, drawn face from one to the other beseechingly.\r\n\r\n“Fair,” cried Travers, clutching his hand and speaking fast and like one\r\nwho has passed beyond consternation into the very heart of abandonment,\r\n“if you are not mad, what does this mean? If you are in earnest—if this\r\nhorrible thing is true—you know that Allyne and I would risk our lives to\r\nsave yours, but why——?”\r\n\r\n“Twenty times,” broke in Allyne, pushing Fair back into a seat. “We would\r\nrisk twenty lives for you, old man; but if you have really rid the world\r\nof that unhung dog, why in the name of Mrs. Fair and the children, to\r\nsay nothing of us and common sense, don’t you get away until we can get\r\nyour defense in order? Forgive my fool tongue, old man, for, of course, I\r\ncould not believe that this was anything but some new sort of game. Did\r\nthe blackguard attack you? Don’t let the ugly business get on your nerves\r\ntoo much to let you see that this is no murder at all.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” put in Travers eagerly, groping through the dark to catch at any\r\nstraw of hope or light. “And for God’s sake leave the country until your\r\nsolicitor can prepare your case. Come, now, explain.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a simple story,” began Fair more calmly now that he had got them\r\nto accept the situation. “The fool came here to extort blackmail—and\r\nI killed him. Mrs. Fair saw me, and, Travers, you saw my pistol, you\r\nremember—still warm and with one chamber discharged. The servants heard\r\nthe shot. The man’s body is still in the house, and nothing remains but\r\nto give myself up to the police. Lopez knows the history of my relations\r\nwith his friend, and he will be only too glad to testify that I had\r\nthreatened to kill Mendes, against whom I had a long-standing grudge.\r\nThe case against me is complete, you see, so I prefer to end it all by\r\nsurrendering myself at once.”\r\n\r\n“Not if we can stop you,” shouted Travers fiercely. “And as for the\r\npistol—unless you go regularly off your head and tell them that I saw it,\r\nthey will never know it. And, of course, you know, your wife’s testimony\r\nwould not be taken against you, even if she should wish to give it.”\r\n\r\n“But she is not my wife,” groaned Fair, looking up at him.\r\n\r\n“What!” thundered Travers, significantly glancing at Allyne, who wheeled\r\naround to Fair and exclaimed: “Cæsar’s ghost! Look here, Fair, you are\r\nrubbing it in rather too deep, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, it will be a pretty story when it is told in the papers,” muttered\r\nFair, his hands thrust deep in his pockets and his legs stretched out in\r\nfront of him.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps it will,” replied Travers, rising and going toward the door with\r\nhis hat on, “but I don’t propose to hear you tell it. My God, man, you\r\ncan’t expect us to hear it and then stand up and swear away your life!\r\nYou’re mad. My duty is clear. Good night. Allyne, ring me up at the club\r\nin an hour. This is—” He did not finish the sentence, but hurried to the\r\ndoor, which he had reached when Fair spoke.\r\n\r\n“All right, old man,” he said, without turning to Travers, “if you choose\r\nto desert. I have faced tight places before. I’m game now.”\r\n\r\n“No, hang it, Fair,” answered Travers, coming back from the door and\r\nconfronting Fair, “you know that I will not leave you; but why must you\r\nask Allyne and me to learn all this—when we could otherwise swear to the\r\nfact of your being what we have always known you to be—yes, know you to\r\nbe now—for, by gad, you can’t get me to believe you.”\r\n\r\n“Hang the swearing,” said Allyne, trying to laugh. “If they get me on the\r\nwitness stand, I’ll let them know what I think of greasy foreigners, and\r\nmy views as to sending them where they belong. Go on, Fair, and tell us\r\nwhat they did next.”\r\n\r\n“Then sit down, Travers, and hear me out,” replied Fair, filling the\r\nthree glasses and regaining an air of quiet.\r\n\r\n“Blaze away,” answered Travers, dropping into a chair with resignation.\r\n“At the bottom of a hole one can’t fall lower—so go on.”\r\n\r\n“Have a drink, both of you, and we’ll get on,” said Fair, and all three\r\nsipped their drink in silence for some minutes. Then Fair said:\r\n\r\n“Many years ago the noble woman whom you know as Mrs. Fair was married\r\nto the wretched man whom I killed yesterday. She afterward discovered\r\nthat he had a living wife, and she, of course, therefore, found herself\r\na nameless outcast. She appealed to me, and for two reasons I offered\r\nher the protection of my name. I had loved her some years before, and I\r\ninherited from my fathers a sort of morbid craving to sacrifice my life\r\nto a cause or purpose which the reason and the prudence of all normally\r\nminded men would discountenance.”\r\n\r\n“Surely wedding such a glorious woman as Mrs. Fair was scarcely what one\r\ncould look at as a sacrifice of one’s life,” protested Travers when Fair\r\npaused for a moment.\r\n\r\n“She is indeed a queen, a priceless woman,” murmured Fair quietly, “but\r\nher children are not my children—she never became my wife. She has been\r\na sacred vocation to me, and while men envied me the love of such a\r\nwife, I was really living the life of a celibate because of a mad, but\r\ninexorable, fixed idea. You fail to understand this? So do I. I only know\r\nthat nothing in heaven or earth could have deterred me from assuming\r\nthe position in which I have lived so long. This may be madness—but it\r\nis of the very essence of my being. And then I came to love another\r\nwoman—and you may imagine what I suffered. But there was a satisfaction\r\nin it all which, of course, you men will be unable to comprehend. But,\r\nsee the irony of fate. The only thing that made life possible has been\r\ndashed away from me. I lived supported by the thought that Janet and her\r\nchildren were saved from shame by my effacement, and now I must proclaim\r\nthat they are not my flesh and blood, to shield them from the disgrace of\r\nbeing thought a murderer’s kin. Isn’t it horrible? But it is only fate’s\r\nswift way of damning me for what I had just been so weak as to decide to\r\ndo. I was about to let my love—the gnawing hunger of a real life—have\r\nway. I had decided, on this very day, to proclaim my love for— Fellows,\r\nfor God’s sake, never go back upon your destiny even if, as in my case,\r\nit should mean lifelong torture. After all, there may not be a hell after\r\ndeath, for there’s one on this side of the grave—and I am in it.”\r\n\r\nHe dropped his head on the edge of the table. Allyne, whose heart was\r\nlike a child’s, could bear the sight of his agony no longer, and walked\r\nto the end of the room. Travers came over to Fair’s side and laid his\r\nhand on his head.\r\n\r\n“This is the most stupendous thing I ever heard of, Fair,” he said; “and\r\nif there is such a thing as justice, you shall not suffer.”\r\n\r\n“There is a thing called justice,” replied Fair, looking up, “and\r\ntherefore I must die.”\r\n\r\n“Not if you will allow us to save you from yourself,” cried Allyne,\r\nreturning to them. “My soul, man, no case can be made out against you\r\nunless you make it yourself. Do let us act for you. Counsel must be\r\nsecured at once. Come, come, I know the very man.”\r\n\r\n“Presently, presently,” answered Fair. “I telegraphed Marshall, my\r\nsolicitor, that we would call at his chambers tonight at ten. But before\r\nwe go I want you two to have the case in detail. I promise to be governed\r\nby you and Marshall when you have all the facts. That’s reasonable.”\r\n\r\n“Then there will be no difficulty, I promise you,” replied Allyne, with\r\nrenewed good spirits. “Marshall has no romantic rubbish in his gray\r\nmatter. Maxwell, you’re a disembodied ghost of some crusader who hasn’t\r\nheard that Adam and Eve left Paradise some time ago for good. I drink to\r\nyou, Sir Altruist.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks, old chap,” said Fair, with moistening eyes.\r\n\r\n“By Jove, I feel better,” exclaimed Travers, stretching his arms and\r\nholding Fair by both shoulders. “I’d like to be worthy of you, Fair.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, come, I say, Dick,” protested Fair. “In a few weeks it will be\r\ndeucedly awkward to be asked if you were not a friend of mine.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll see about that,” retorted Travers defiantly. “Now, the details.”\r\n\r\nWhile they sat, Fair walked to and fro before them with folded arms.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he began, “for five years I was happy in seeing Janet and her two\r\nboys safe under the shadow of my broken heart; but about a year ago Lopez\r\ncame to me and told me that some disreputable Cuban acquaintances of his\r\nhad learned poor Janet’s secret, and that a paltry hundred pounds would\r\nkeep them quiet. I, of course, sent him about his business and reported\r\nthe matter to the police. The Cubans quietly got hold of Janet—just how\r\nI was never quite sure—and played upon her love for her children until\r\nthey extorted one sum after another from her without my knowledge. At\r\nlast they demanded a sum so vast that the poor girl was compelled to\r\nappeal to me. I told her to ignore their letters, and had them shadowed\r\nby detectives. We discovered that Mendes himself was at the head of a\r\ngang whose plan was to get the secrets of rich families for blackmailing\r\npurposes, his private fortune having been gambled away on the Continent.\r\nMore than once Lopez or Mendes has ruined a woman of standing, and while\r\npretending to remain a devoted lover, has told the other, who would at\r\nonce begin the extortion of hush money. Mendes came here yesterday—and I\r\nshot him like a dog. Now Lopez will show that I was the paramour of my\r\nvictim’s wife, and that my crime followed naturally upon Mendes tracking\r\nhis wife to my house, and there learning that I had palmed her off as my\r\nwife for years. Those are the facts. Complete, wouldn’t you say?”\r\n\r\nAllyne, always more susceptible to all emotions than Travers, frankly\r\nlooked the horror he felt as he began to realize the truly desperate\r\nsituation in which Fair now was; but Travers, after thinking for a few\r\nmoments in silence, spoke out bravely: “Confound it, man, isn’t it a\r\nprinciple of law that a man is innocent until proven guilty? Who knows\r\nthat you killed the scoundrel? And if suspicion should be drawn toward\r\nyou, why, then let them prove the charge if they can. And, anyhow,\r\ncan’t you plead that you killed him while protecting Mrs. Fair? The\r\nblackguard’s character will make it difficult for Lopez to prove Mendes’s\r\nalleged relations with Janet. I’d be hanged if I’d be hanged just for the\r\nfun of it.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, but my dear fellow,” returned Fair, arguing out his point in his\r\ncustomary cool way, “you forget. It is known that he came to this house.\r\nIt is known that he did not leave it. His body, my dear friend—his\r\ncorpse, you know, is a nasty bit of evidence that we can’t get rid of.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean to say,” answered Travers, face to face with the calm man,\r\n“do you mean to tell us that the—that the chap’s corpse, you know, was in\r\nthe house last night while you and Janet were entertaining us? If you are\r\nthe man you are, surely no woman at any rate could have stood that.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, you don’t know her,” smiled Fair. “To save me—yes, to please me\r\neven, that woman would do anything—bear anything.”\r\n\r\n“And she jolly well ought to,” put in Allyne, slapping Fair’s back, and\r\nthen with a nervous look about the room: “I say, what did you do with\r\nthe—with that infernal thing, you know?”\r\n\r\n“With the body?” asked Fair, with entire freedom from excitement. “It is\r\nhere yet.”\r\n\r\n“Here?” cried Allyne angrily and sick with perplexity.\r\n\r\n“In the house now?” asked Travers, scowling but not believing.\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” replied Fair quietly. “What could I have done with it last\r\nnight? You all came in within a few minutes of the deed. Yes, it is in\r\nthe house—it is in this room now.”\r\n\r\n“The devil you say!” exclaimed Allyne, facing about as if he feared that\r\nthe dreadful thing was back of him somewhere.\r\n\r\n“Rather a gruesome thing to joke about, isn’t it?” asked Travers sadly,\r\nand still utterly unable to believe what he heard.\r\n\r\n“Horrible—but true,” answered Fair, with disconcerting calmness as he\r\nwalked slowly over toward the chest by the fireplace, while Allyne and\r\nTravers watched him breathlessly. “It is here.”\r\n\r\nHe seemed to take an eternity to do whatever it was that he intended to\r\ndo, but finally as he stood over the chest he said, looking from one to\r\nthe other: “If a man ever had a more terrible guest under his roof than\r\nmine, I pity him. Look!”\r\n\r\nAs he said this he suddenly stooped and raised the lid of the chest. The\r\ntwo now thoroughly horrified men were standing on either side of him.\r\nThey all peered, shuddering, into the chest. _It was empty._\r\n\r\n“Gone?” moaned Fair, for the first time betraying uncontrolled horror.\r\n\r\n“That settles it,” shouted Travers, delirious with joy. “You see, you\r\nhave been dreaming this whole cursed nightmare.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Allyne was running about the room, swinging a chair over his\r\nhead and shouting like a madman. Coming back to Fair he sang out with\r\nhysterical laughter: “Rest and quiet—rest—and qui—et, sir—that’s what we\r\nneed. Ice on the head, hot water at the feet—and a month at sea. May I\r\nhave the pleasure?” Before Fair could stop him he had waltzed him around\r\nthe room. At last Fair broke away from him, and holding his hands to his\r\nsplitting head, he brought them back to a full realization of the awful\r\ntruth by the expression on his face.\r\n\r\n“Hush!” he cried to Allyne. “For God’s sake, Allyne, stop it. I swear\r\non my honor that I put it into this chest. It has been discovered by\r\nsomebody and removed today. I sat up all night in this room, so that it\r\nmust have been taken away today. Come. That’s the end. I might as well\r\nsurrender without delay.”\r\n\r\n“But wait, wait,” broke in Travers. “Who knew of it’s being here? Who\r\ncould have discovered it? Now don’t be rash. Let us think before we act.\r\nHow could it have been found? That is, if it ever was here.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, there are a thousand ways in which it might have been found,”\r\nanswered Fair, ignoring his unbelief.\r\n\r\n“Did Mrs. Fair know about it?” asked Allyne, and was startled by the\r\neffect of his question.\r\n\r\nFair sprang up, thought for a moment, and then exclaimed: “By heaven,\r\nAllyne, that’s it. My God! Do you know what that means?” He clenched his\r\nhands and glared at them, stupefied with grief.\r\n\r\n“It means,” said Travers, “that she has disposed of it. It means that\r\nyour chances are a thousand-fold better than before.”\r\n\r\n“No, no!” shrieked Fair. “It means—but no—she could not be so\r\nunspeakably unkind to the children as to try to prove that she killed\r\nhim. No. I give it up, then. Come, come, I can’t bear this much longer. I\r\nmust get the relief of surrendering myself. Come.”\r\n\r\n“If you attempt to give yourself up, by gad, I’ll have you locked up for\r\na dangerous lunatic,” said Travers, with strange new determination as he\r\nnoticed how rapidly Fair was breaking. “I tell you, Fair, that— Hark!\r\nThat was that beastly footstep again. I’m not a coward, but this— Hark!”\r\n\r\nThey listened with tense faces. Again the sound. And again.\r\n\r\n“That was certainly a footstep—upstairs, too,” whispered Travers. “Come\r\nFair, this is no place for you now. Allyne, if he refuses to come with\r\nus, help me to force him out of this hole. Hear me? Now come.”\r\n\r\nFair struggled away from their grasp and ran to the door, saying: “I will\r\ngo with you, but I am going upstairs first—alone.”\r\n\r\n“You are going to do nothing of the sort,” replied Travers, again\r\ngrasping his arm and pulling him back.\r\n\r\n“Don’t come with me, please,” pleaded Fair; “I’ll be only a minute.”\r\n\r\n“Never fear,” answered Allyne at his other arm; “I wouldn’t go up there\r\nwith anybody—but you are not going up, either. Out with him, Travers.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, come, old man,” begged Travers earnestly. “Notify the police that\r\nthieves are in the house, call the fire brigade—anything, but don’t be a\r\nfool and expose yourself to you don’t know what danger. Come!”\r\n\r\nThey strained at him, and presently Fair gave in, saying: “Very well, it\r\nis getting a bit on my nerves, I confess. Go to the top of the stairs\r\nbefore I turn out the light. All ready? There.”\r\n\r\nHe turned out the light and felt his way to the stairs, down which\r\nTravers and Allyne preceded him, and the next moment they stepped out\r\ninto the blessed coolness and relief of the street.\r\n\r\nThe instant that Fair turned out the light in the library a man stole\r\nquickly in from the adjoining study and groped his way to the chest in\r\nthe total darkness. Just after the street door slammed two persons, who\r\nhad been listening on the floor above the library, began whispering as\r\nthey descended the stairs and approached that room.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Fair and his two friends called a cab and drove off eastward\r\nand soon were set down in the Strand near the law courts, proposing to\r\nmake the remainder of their journey on foot.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nAt sixty Marshall, Maxwell Fair’s solicitor, found himself a bachelor,\r\na solicitor with an income of twenty thousand pounds and a very decided\r\nattachment for his few wealthy clients and an aversion to new ones. Long\r\npast the necessity of accepting new clients, Marshall, like so many old\r\nTemplars, asked for nothing but to be let alone among his books and\r\ncronies in the Inner Temple, and allowed to spend his brief holidays at\r\nhis shooting-box by the Norfolk Broads.\r\n\r\nIt was with no very good grace, therefore, that he returned to town on\r\nthat wet Sunday in response to an absurdly urgent telegram from Fair,\r\nwhose usual business was exactly to old Marshall’s taste, since it\r\nconsisted of drawing perfunctory documents having to do with real estate,\r\nand never involving critical issues of any sort.\r\n\r\nBut the snug thousands which Fair’s enormous interests brought to him\r\nannually made it impolitic to ignore his most uncharacteristic bit of\r\nhysterics. Accordingly, after dining in gloomy solitude at his quiet\r\nlittle chop-house, Marshall surprised his laundress by turning up at\r\nhis chambers in the Inner Temple at nine o’clock on Sunday evening in a\r\ncrusty temper. Fair would arrive at ten, so Marshall settled down for an\r\nhour with Browne’s “Religio Medici,” when to an irritating knock he sang\r\nout a curt, “Come in! come in!” and a lady entered.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Marshall, I believe?” said the lady.\r\n\r\n“Yes, madam,” replied Marshall, rising; “but my business hours—In fact, I\r\nam engaged—just leaving, you know—and, besides, I expect a gentleman by\r\nappointment at any moment.”\r\n\r\n“I venture to think that, whatever his business may be, you will consider\r\nmy case the one requiring immediate attention,” quietly answered the\r\nlady, seating herself, although the old solicitor had not suggested her\r\ndoing so.\r\n\r\n“Case? Case?” exclaimed Marshall. “Why, bless us all, I haven’t taken any\r\nnew cases in years. Couldn’t think of it, madam.”\r\n\r\n“But,” returned the lady vehemently, “a crime has been committed, and I——”\r\n\r\n“Crime, you say?” shouted Marshall as if he were being insulted. “Good\r\nheavens, my good woman, do you imagine that I am interested in crime?”\r\n\r\n“But Mr. Fair has, I think, some claim upon your advice and counsel?”\r\nreplied the lady, with the assurance of one who trumps an ace.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Fair has certainly every claim upon me,” answered Marshall, sitting\r\ndown and becoming the cautious and alert barrister at once, “and I trust\r\nyou will appreciate my unwillingness to discuss anything concerning my\r\nclients with strangers.”\r\n\r\n“Strangers?” cried the woman, with such eagerness that Marshall began to\r\nfear all sorts of possible female entanglement. “Why, sir, I am his—I\r\nmean, I know Mr. Fair very well.”\r\n\r\n“Really, madam,” protested the solicitor, now thoroughly certain that\r\nthis woman and the urgent telegram were unpleasantly related. “Really,\r\nyou know, I must beg you will call at some other time. Allow me to see\r\nyou to your carriage.”\r\n\r\n“It will be necessary for you to hear me,” replied the lady firmly. “I\r\nsee that you do not remember me, but we have met before. You were at Mr.\r\nFair’s place in Norfolk about five years ago. You were presented to Mrs.\r\nMaxwell Fair. Well, I am she.”\r\n\r\n“Upon my word, dear madam,” exclaimed Marshall, jumping up, “I did,\r\nindeed, fail to recognize you. That’s a sign I’m getting old, is it not?\r\nThis is an honor, really.”\r\n\r\n“Alas, sir, I fear that you will think it anything but that,” replied\r\nMrs. Fair nervously. “I desire to state before going into the matter\r\nwhich brought me here that I am not the wife of Mr. Maxwell Fair—Mr.\r\nFair never married. I see that this fills you with amazement—pray, don’t\r\nmisjudge him. Believe me, Mr. Fair deserves your deepest regard and\r\nadmiration. My children are not his children. He has been a father, a\r\nbrother, a chivalrous protector—that is all.”\r\n\r\n“But, my dear madam, this is quite beyond belief,” stammered the\r\nsolicitor.\r\n\r\n“It is the truth, as you will learn presently from him. I came here\r\nsimply to tell you that, whatever Mr. Fair may say, my crime does not\r\ninvolve him, as it would of course do if I were his wife. Now for my\r\nstory.”\r\n\r\n“I must remind you, Mrs. Fair,” interrupted Marshall sternly, “that if\r\nyour crime, as you choose to call it, is to the prejudice to Mr. Fair,\r\nI must decline to hear your statement, as, in the event of any issue\r\narising, I must, of course, act on his and not on your behalf.”\r\n\r\n“But it is not a question as between Mr. Fair and me,” answered Mrs.\r\nFair. “The simple and horrible fact is I killed a man yesterday—a Cuban\r\nnamed Pablo Mendes—a wretch who had blasted my life. He dared to pursue\r\nme even into my protector’s house. He heaped the foulest insults upon Mr.\r\nFair and the children and me—so, in a mad access of frenzy and horror, I\r\nshot and instantly killed him. I desire to give myself up to the police.\r\nWhat shall I do, sir?”\r\n\r\nMarshall was walking up and down now with his hands clasped behind his\r\nback, and for several moments he did not answer. Then he said as he stood\r\nconfronting her: “If there were no witnesses, and the man can be proved\r\nto have been your traducer and persecutor, it would not be difficult\r\nto set up a powerful defense. He invaded your house, demanded money,\r\nthreatened you—or, wait, wait—I have it! On failing to extort the money,\r\nhe attacked you, and you, having anticipated just such an assault, had\r\ntaken the precaution to be armed—and shot him down for the blackguard he\r\nwas. Why, my dear Mrs. Fair, a jury would acquit you without leaving the\r\ncourtroom.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, but the facts are not as you state them,” cried Mrs. Fair, rising\r\nand grasping the old man’s hand feverishly. “There was no attack. And,\r\noh, sir, I did it! I did it! I say I! Take me to the police—and make\r\nthem believe that it was I—or—or—well, I can’t tell you now, but unless\r\nyou make them believe me, something most horrible will occur. Do this—do\r\nthis, Mr. Marshall, for God’s sake.”\r\n\r\n“But we must consider this from every side,” replied Marshall, getting\r\nMrs. Fair into a seat again and continuing his walk. “Give me a little\r\ntime to think it out. Could you manage to return early in the morning?\r\nYou are evidently very ill. Rest will refresh you—and, moreover, nothing\r\ncan be done wisely tonight.”\r\n\r\n“Very well—but tell me that you believe me—tell me that,” implored Mrs.\r\nFair, rising to go. She was indeed nearly at the end.\r\n\r\n“Of course I must accept your statement,” answered Marshall with much\r\ngentleness. “Yet it by no means follows that the consequences need be\r\nwhat you apprehend. Allow me to show you down to your carriage.”\r\n\r\n“Here is my statement,” she said as she placed a document on the table\r\nand took the arm which the old solicitor offered her. “Act upon it,\r\nsir—it is a woman’s last story—written in her blood and that of her\r\nchildren. Act upon it, sir, act upon it—no matter what Mr. Fair says.”\r\n\r\n“I promise nothing, madam,” replied Marshall, leading her to the door.\r\n“You are in no condition to take the best or the wisest view of this\r\nmost incredible affair. Depend upon it, I shall act only for your best\r\ninterest and that of Mr. Fair. Come.”\r\n\r\nHe led her down to the street and, after seeing her safely to her\r\ncarriage, slowly retraced his steps into the quiet precincts of the\r\nTemple. When about to enter the door at the foot of his worn stairs, two\r\nmen came walking quickly from the thoroughfare without, and one of them,\r\nrecognizing him, said: “This is my friend Allyne—Lord Linklater’s son,\r\nyou know, Mr. Marshall. May we have a few minutes of your time?—very\r\nurgent matter!”\r\n\r\n“Travers?” said Marshall as he caught sight of his face under the gas\r\nlamp. “What on earth brings you to this old graveyard at this time? I\r\nknow your honored father, Lord Linklater, Mr. Allyne. Come up, gentlemen.”\r\n\r\nOnce more the solicitor entertained no very pleasant conjectures as to\r\nthe purpose of his visitors, whom he knew to be close personal friends of\r\nMaxwell Fair’s. The whole departure was as upsetting as it was sudden.\r\n\r\n“Rather a beastly time to intrude upon you, Mr. Marshall,” said Travers\r\napologetically as they seated themselves in Marshall’s library.\r\n\r\n“And on the beastliest sort of business,” put in Allyne.\r\n\r\nMr. Marshall, finding nothing particular to say, remained silent.\r\n\r\n“We were asked to come here this evening by Mr. Maxwell Fair,” said\r\nTravers, explaining. “He will be here at ten o’clock.”\r\n\r\n“Yes?” softly remarked the imperturbable lawyer; “then we will wait.”\r\n\r\n“The deuce you say,” protested Allyne in spite of the signal from\r\nTravers. “Why, we came ahead of him expressly.”\r\n\r\n“Shut up, Allyne,” broke in Travers. “Fair knows that we are here, Mr.\r\nMarshall—in fact, we came rather at his suggestion. He gave us full\r\npermission to speak to you.”\r\n\r\n“I shall, of course, be very glad to hear anything that you may deem it\r\ndesirable to tell me. Pray proceed,” said Marshall not very eagerly.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, sir, it is with the utmost sorrow that we have to tell you\r\nthat we are convinced poor Fair has become suddenly insane on a certain\r\ndreadful subject,” went on Travers, irritated by Marshall’s manner.\r\n\r\n“Ah, there we shall have to move very slowly—very—slowly,” said Marshall\r\nwhen Travers stopped. “Mr. Fair is thought to be of unsound mind on a\r\nnumber of subjects by a number of persons. He is so successful, you\r\nknow—so original, that others who are merely British fail to understand\r\nhim. Moreover, Fair is unselfish, sympathetic, altruistic—and of course\r\nappears mad to our smug, hoggish world.”\r\n\r\n“Damn it,” exclaimed Allyne, “that’s all, as you say, but the dear fellow\r\nhas gone clean off his head this time, you know. You just wait until\r\nTravers gives you the details.”\r\n\r\n“I am waiting,” answered Marshall calmly.\r\n\r\n“Before we come to that,” said Travers in answer to Marshall’s look, “I\r\nbelieve, Mr. Marshall, that you knew Fair’s father, did you not?”\r\n\r\n“Intimately—and his grandfather also. What of them?”\r\n\r\n“What sort were they?”\r\n\r\n“Very much like Fair—both were thought mad.”\r\n\r\n“In what way? They were men of tremendous will power and fixity of\r\npurpose, were they not? I have reason for asking.”\r\n\r\n“Quite so. They were idealists, dreamers, monomaniacs—but why?”\r\n\r\n“I thought as much. The stuff martyrs are made of. Tell us about them, if\r\nyou don’t mind, Mr. Marshall,” said Travers, unaccountably insistent.\r\n\r\n“Very well,” began Marshall, really glad to be able thus to kill time\r\nuntil Fair arrived. “His grandfather got it into his head that he\r\nwas bound in honor to extricate his publishers—he was an author, you\r\nknow—from their financial difficulties, although it was clearly proved in\r\ncourt that they had only their own speculative folly to thank for their\r\nfailure. Well, poor old Fair lost his all and even mortgaged the Norfolk\r\nestates. In spite of his solicitors, he pressed forward eagerly to ruin,\r\nand died perfectly happy in the knowledge that he had lived up to his\r\nideal. Mad—stark mad!”\r\n\r\n“By Jove, it sounds like Fair all over again!” exclaimed Allyne.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” went on the old lawyer, warming to his favorite work of decrying\r\nidealism of every sort. “Yes, gentlemen, and our Mr. Fair’s father was\r\nno better than his grandfather. He spent the first half of his life in\r\nfreeing the estates from their heavy encumbrances—and the second half in\r\nthrowing away all that he had accumulated in the first. His specialty was\r\nyoung geniuses—any kind of young genius, musical, literary, artistic.\r\nAny chap who could not get an editor to print his stuff could count on\r\nFair bringing out an _édition de luxe_ at his own expense. And any young\r\nwoman had but to get her mother to tell him with tears in her eyes that\r\nshe had wonderful musical promise and away she would go to Germany to be\r\neducated—of course at Fair’s expense. You probably know that he died in\r\nlodgings in Mile End, where he had removed in order to live among those\r\nwhom he, poor old dreamer, imagined would appreciate his sympathy. He\r\nleft our Mr. Fair nothing but the estates heavily mortgaged again.”\r\n\r\n“And Maxwell is a chip of the old block,” commented Travers when the\r\nsolicitor stopped. “But Mr. Marshall, he has done more than either his\r\nfather or grandfather in the way of self-effacement. His life is one long\r\ntragedy for an idea. That is bad enough. But now he proposes actually to\r\ndestroy himself for it. Unless we can prevent it, he will die.”\r\n\r\n“Good heavens,” cried Marshall, unable to treat the terrible intensity\r\non Travers’s face with his customary calmness. “It’s not quite so bad as\r\nthat. What, in the name of reason, is the man about now?”\r\n\r\n“Listen,” said Travers, glad to have at last roused the stoical man of\r\nlaw from his leathery, noncommittal expression, “Fair declares that he\r\nhas committed a crime which will send him to the gallows— Why, what ails\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\nTravers stopped and stared at the lawyer, who was strangely delighted by\r\nhis last few words. Marshall’s acute mind had evidently been scouting.\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” replied Marshall, regaining his quiet manner; “I was thinking\r\nof a similar case that once came to my notice. Go on.”\r\n\r\n“There is no evidence against him, and yet the wretched victim of his own\r\nhigh-flown notions is determined to go ahead to destruction. For God’s\r\nsake, sir, help us to prevent this, even by placing him in a madhouse.”\r\nTravers saw that his words touched the old man, but that professional\r\ncaution and habitual reserve were restraining him from avowing his\r\npurpose, whatever it might be.\r\n\r\nThis angered Allyne, who broke in with the sneering comment: “The law\r\nkeeps no end of rascals from getting their richly deserved medicine. I\r\nthink it’s a jolly beastly outrage if it can’t prevent an innocent man\r\nfrom hanging himself.”\r\n\r\n“The ways of the law,” answered Marshall, with cold judicial accent,\r\n“the ways of the law, Mr. Allyne, are not as our ways. The law proceeds\r\nwithout sentiment or bias, and must go straight to its object in the\r\nlight of fact.”\r\n\r\n“But, I tell you, the facts can’t be as Fair states them to be, don’t\r\nyou know,” retorted Allyne hotly, galled by the lawyer’s coolness and\r\nformality.\r\n\r\n“Then Mr. Fair has nothing to fear,” quietly replied Marshall. “It is ten\r\no’clock. Fair is a punctual man—he will be here immediately. Suppose that\r\nwe allow him to explain himself.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll be hanged if I will let him go too far. Why, gentlemen, this is\r\nmonstrous! Do you mean to say, Marshall, that you——?”\r\n\r\nA knock interrupted Allyne, and immediately Fair came in, looking not at\r\nall as though he could possibly be the subject of his friend’s anxiety.\r\n\r\n“I’m awfully sorry,” Fair began, “to learn from your laundress,\r\nMarshall, that my telegram brought you back to town from the country. I\r\npromise you it won’t happen again.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense,” returned Marshall, studying Fair closely, “I was only too\r\nglad of an excuse to come back to town. You know, we old Templars don’t\r\nenjoy the country—been caged here too long for that. Sit down, dear\r\nfellow. What can I get up for you—sherry?”\r\n\r\n“Thanks, nothing for me. Perhaps the others——”\r\n\r\n“Lord, no!” roared Allyne before Marshall could ask.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, to the point,” said Fair, seating himself calmly and\r\nlighting a cigar with the air of a director of a company about to discuss\r\nthe treasurer’s report. “Travers has told you, Marshall?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” answered the solicitor. “We were discussing peculiarities of\r\ntemperament. I was just telling your friends what people used to say of\r\nyour father. You know, we are all mad on some subject.”\r\n\r\n“I see,” replied Fair, smiling. “Allyne has mentioned madness and\r\nmadhouses, I should say, about once every five minutes all day long.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and we mean it,” thundered Allyne. “At it now. This is rum.”\r\n\r\n“I can put the facts before you in a word, Marshall,” said Fair.\r\n\r\n“Do so. I am all attention,” returned the lawyer, settling back into\r\nhis chair with a puzzling look, in which there was certainly a trace of\r\namusement not easily explained.\r\n\r\n“Some Cuban gentlemen have been extorting blackmail from certain\r\naristocratic families,” went on Fair in a monotone, “and they had,\r\nwithout my knowledge, frightened Mrs. Fair into paying them considerable\r\nsums. The leader of the gang, one Pablo Mendes, came to my house\r\nyesterday, and finding him in the library with Mrs. Fair I killed him.”\r\n\r\n“Proceed,” said Marshall when Fair paused to note the effect of his\r\nannouncement, speaking with so much coolness that Fair jumped up and\r\nwent on fiercely: “I tell you, I shot him down like a dog—murdered him\r\nin cold blood. The servants heard the report of the pistol. Travers came\r\nin a moment after the shooting and saw the pistol still warm. I hid the\r\nman’s body in a chest in the library, from which it was taken by somebody\r\ntoday—so any effort on my part to delay the hand of justice would be\r\nridiculous. What shall I do?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing!” exclaimed Marshall. Then he added, as if regretting the\r\nunguarded word: “That is, I can’t advise you until I know more. Go on.”\r\n\r\n“That’s the game, Marshall,” put in Allyne, pleased by the lawyer’s\r\nmanifest incredulity. “Fair, you idiot, do you fancy that everybody has\r\ngone off his head just because you have?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, please, Mr. Allyne,” said Marshall deprecatingly.\r\n\r\n“You take this rather coolly, I must say, Marshall,” remarked Fair when\r\nTravers had succeeded in pushing Allyne into a chair.\r\n\r\n“I find coolness conducive to clear thinking,” replied Marshall.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, I have nothing further to say. I have murdered a man. I\r\nhave neither the heart nor the wish to set up a defense. Were I to clear\r\nmyself by technicalities, it would become the duty of the police to try\r\nto establish the guilt of someone else. Would you have me sit by quietly,\r\nwhile they drew the net of skilfully devised circumstantial evidence\r\naround some innocent person? And to whom else could suspicion point? My\r\nservants—or, God help her, the woman who is known as my wife, and who is\r\nthe noblest soul I ever met? If you cannot meet my arguments, I shall go\r\nat once to the police and surrender myself.”\r\n\r\n“There will be plenty of time for all that,” replied Marshall, showing so\r\nlittle feeling that Allyne was on the point of breaking out again. “The\r\npolice would not believe your story, I fear. You see, my dear fellow,\r\nyour case is by no means unique. Only a very little while ago one very\r\nmuch like it was brought to my attention. A murder—or at all events, a\r\ndeath, had occurred. Suspicion pointed strongly to one of two persons—a\r\ngentleman of eccentric character, and the woman whom he had loved in\r\nearly youth. Now mark the dramatic interest. Each of them confessed the\r\ncrime to save the other, but, of course, as they both could not have been\r\nguilty, the court refused to entertain the charge against either. There\r\nwas no evidence except the bogus confession of the two. I mention this\r\ncase only to show you that too hasty action on your part now may spoil\r\neverything—and you may not be allowed the luxury of hanging.”\r\n\r\n“But, Marshall,” said Fair, “the cases are not even remotely similar.\r\nOthers will testify that I had the most powerful motives for my crime,\r\nand, unless I should be dastard enough to lie, nobody else can be\r\nsuspected. Lopez knows that Mendes was my enemy. Janet knows that I was\r\nin the room when the murder was done. Travers knows that a pistol, which\r\nhe identified as mine, had been discharged a few minutes before he saw\r\nme—at the very time that the servants heard the report in the library.\r\nMoreover, somebody discovered the body of my victim where I had hid\r\nit. On top of all this I confess the awful fact. What more can the law\r\npossibly require? You believe what I tell you, do you not?”\r\n\r\n“Not one word of it!” fairly cried Marshall.\r\n\r\n“Marshall,” Fair replied with terrible earnestness, “you say you doubt my\r\nword. Such a statement must be explained.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” returned Marshall, now thoroughly in control of his\r\nfeelings. “I will explain. I doubt your story because of its inherent\r\nimprobability. Further, I doubt it because I knew your father, because\r\nI know yourself, and am aware that not even a shameful death on the\r\ngibbet could deter you from any purpose which you had come to think your\r\ndestiny. Again, I doubt it because I know who the real murderer of Mendes\r\nis.”\r\n\r\nThe three men who heard these last slow, calm words sprang to their feet\r\ntogether, Fair quivering with a nameless horror, and his two friends\r\ndelirious with joy.\r\n\r\nFair steadied himself against the lawyer’s table and said: “Marshall,\r\nthis is not the time when you can play with me. I tell you to your face,\r\nthat when you say that you know who the murderer is, you lie.”\r\n\r\nThe old man showed how deeply the insult cut into him, and facing the\r\nyoung man with his own face as white as Fair’s, he retorted: “Your\r\nfather’s son can go very far with me, but no man can give me the lie.\r\nRecall that word, Fair.”\r\n\r\nTravers looked imploringly at Fair as he replied.\r\n\r\n“I do recall it—and beg your pardon,” said Fair eagerly. “I also demand\r\nan explanation of your singular conduct.”\r\n\r\n“If you will all sit down,” replied the solicitor, “I will prove that I\r\nam right. But before I do so I want to say that in all my life I never\r\nheard of such sublime devotion, such utterly disinterested heroism.\r\nGentlemen, nothing will ever be more of an honor to us than to be called\r\nthe friends of Maxwell Fair.”\r\n\r\n“Hear, hear!” shouted Allyne, but Travers said quietly to Marshall: “I\r\nfear this is scarcely kind of you just now—look at his face.”\r\n\r\nThe old lawyer looked at Fair, and going over to him grasped his hand.\r\n\r\n“Forgive me, boy,” he said, “but I meant each word. To end this dreadful\r\nbusiness I have merely to state that the unhappy creature who sent\r\nthe scoundrel to his doom came here not an hour ago and made a full\r\nconfession.”\r\n\r\n“And on my honor I swear that every word she said was false,” said Fair.\r\n\r\n“You, at least, believe me?” asked Marshall, turning to Travers.\r\n\r\n“Most assuredly,” replied Travers.\r\n\r\nFair wheeled round at him, saying: “My God, are you men English gentlemen\r\nand going to allow an innocent woman to be hanged in order to save me?”\r\n\r\n“I seem to hear your father speak in you,” remarked Marshall, “yet there\r\nis this difference, Fair. He would have died for a great purpose, but\r\nnever for a lie or to defeat the ends of justice.”\r\n\r\nFair winced at this, and Travers said: “That’s the line, Marshall.”\r\n\r\n“Not a word he has said can move me,” went on Fair, rising. “I want no\r\nman’s forced friendship. I have decided on a course. You choose to allow\r\nme to pursue it alone. Good-bye.”\r\n\r\nHe spoke with such feeling, and moved toward the door with so much\r\nmajesty, that none of them attempted to stop him.\r\n\r\nBefore he reached the door it was opened and a closely cropped head\r\nappeared, and a soft, insinuating cockney voice said: “Beg pardon, I’m\r\nsure. Ferret, gentlemen; Ferret, of Scotland Yard.”\r\n\r\n“You see, Marshall, others are not as incredulous as you. I am the man\r\nyou want, Mr. Ferret,” said Fair as the detective came in and sat down.\r\n\r\n“I’ll attend to you, sir, in a minute,” replied Ferret jauntily. “Perhaps\r\nthese gentlemen will try a cigar in the gardens for a few minutes.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, never mind them,” quickly returned Fair; “they know all. Proceed.”\r\n\r\n“But you see, sir, they _don’t_ know all,” replied Ferret.\r\n\r\n“I think, Fair, that we would better let this man speak to you alone,”\r\nsaid Marshall, rising.\r\n\r\nFerret interposed: “I shall ask you to stop, if you don’t mind, Mr.\r\nMarshall.”\r\n\r\n“As you like,” answered Marshall.\r\n\r\nTravers and Allyne went downstairs after shaking Fair’s hand with very\r\nmuch mixed feelings.\r\n\r\nMarshall and Fair turned to Ferret when the door was closed, and Fair\r\nsaid sternly: “I see that you have been rather impudently examining that\r\nsworn statement on the table there. It will save time if I tell you that\r\nit is false. The lady wrote it under a nervous strain. It is totally\r\nfalse.”\r\n\r\n“Sure. It’s just as false as your own statement, Mr. Fair,” replied\r\nFerret, winking knowingly at the solicitor, who failed to appreciate the\r\nfellow’s humor and resented his apparently unconscionable impertinence.\r\n\r\n“What the devil do you mean?” asked Marshall angrily, yet with relief.\r\n\r\n“I mean,” answered the cool one, “that, thanks to my little chum, it\r\nnow becomes my painful duty to admit that I suspected Mr. Fair until\r\nabout two hours ago. I now know that Mrs. Fair’s statement is false—and\r\nlikewise Mr. Fair’s also. It’s the other gent’s statement that is the\r\ntrue one.”\r\n\r\n“The other gentleman’s statement?” asked Fair fiercely. “Why, man, there\r\nwas no other man in the room when the shot was fired.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I say, come now, Mr. Fair,” smilingly protested Ferret. “The gent\r\nas fired the shot was there, you know. You see, Mr. Marshall, it was\r\nthis way. Mendes had threatened Mrs. Fair, and she went out and got the\r\npistol, and at that moment Mr. Fair came into the room. Mendes shot\r\nhimself, and Mr. Fair, hearing the shot and seeing the smoking pistol in\r\nMrs. Fair’s hand, snatched it away from her and declared that it was he\r\nand not her that did the killing. She came here tonight and swore it was\r\nher, and now he comes and swears it was him. But Mendes swore just as he\r\nwas dying that it was himself—and the priest will testify to that.”\r\n\r\n“But, my heavens, man, Mendes died at once. I hid his body in——”\r\n\r\n“In the chest,” interrupted the detective, grinning. “Yes, I know all\r\nabout that. But, you see, Mendes did not die. He came to while you were\r\nat dinner. Our fellows followed him to his lodgings in Soho—and today my\r\nchum got hold of a letter that gave her the address, and she and I were\r\nwith him when he died an hour ago—yes, and Mrs. Fair is there now.”\r\n\r\nWhile he was speaking Fair sank back into his chair, as if unconscious\r\nof what was passing, but when Ferret paused he sprang up, crying,\r\n“Marshall, did you ever hear of anything so unspeakably glorious as\r\nJanet’s devotion?”\r\n\r\n“Yes—once,” answered Marshall, with streaming eyes. “Your own, Fair.”\r\n\r\n“But, Ferret,” went on Fair, when he had recovered his voice, “who is the\r\nchum who so materially assisted you? And where is Mrs. Fair now?”\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Fair is by Mendes’s bedside. My chum is——”\r\n\r\nThe door opened and Kate Mettleby came hurrying in, breathless and worn.\r\nFerret finished by saying: “My chum, gentlemen.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Mr. Fair,” began Kate, after Fair had presented Marshall to her with\r\na word of explanation, “have you heard? Janet is with him—with Señor\r\nMendes—it was awful—it was unbearably touching.”\r\n\r\n“He is the father of her children, Kate,” said Fair gently, when Marshall\r\nand Ferret quietly stole out, leaving them together.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know—and—Maxwell—there is something—oh, how can I tell you?\r\nShe came in and knelt by his bed with his head in her arms when the\r\npriest told her that he was dead. She knelt there half an hour, and\r\nwhen it was time for us to start to come here to meet you—Maxwell, can\r\nyou bear it?—when I went and touched her shoulder and told her to come\r\naway—she—was dead.”\r\n\r\nKate’s head fell upon her folded arms on the table and her body shook\r\nwith the strain of the awful day’s events. Fair suffered her to cry\r\nherself into a quieter state. Then he stooped and laying his hand on her\r\nhead, he said: “Kate, the children have no mother now.”\r\n\r\n                                 THE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _All Gain_\r\n\r\n\r\nTAPESON—How much did he make out of that stock company he formed?\r\n\r\nTICKERLY—All that was put into it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Educational Department\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are thousands of boys and girls, some in the schools and colleges,\r\nsome not, who are anxious to learn to develop themselves and RISE.\r\nMany, many things they yearn to know which the class-room teachers do\r\nnot teach. Many a subject they are eager to study, if somebody will but\r\nshow the way. Often there are speeches to be made, essays to be written,\r\ndebates to be prepared, and the boys and girls simply do not know how\r\nto start about it. For instance, they are suddenly required to write\r\nor speak on the question: “Should the Government own and operate the\r\nrailroads?”\r\n\r\nThey have never read anything about it, perhaps. Therefore they inquire:\r\n“Where can we get some literature on the subject?” These young people\r\ndo not want someone else to write their speeches or essays; they want\r\nnothing more than to be told where to get the materials to work with—the\r\ndata upon which to construct their own argument.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a boy I felt the need of that kind of help very keenly. How\r\nwas I to know what books contained the information sought? Who could tell\r\nme? I soon found that teachers did not love to be bored by inquiries of\r\nthat character, and therefore I had to browse around in the library at\r\nrandom for what was wanted. If the book needed was there, I generally\r\nfound it, after wasting much time in the search. If it was not there, as\r\nfrequently happened, I was at my row’s end. I had to debate without the\r\nfull preparation which should have been made.\r\n\r\nTo help out many a student who may be troubled as I used to be, I\r\nam going to improvise and conduct in this Magazine a modest little\r\nEducational Department. Primarily it is meant for the young people. But\r\nthe rule will be made as flexible as I feel like making it. Age limits\r\nare not fair—no matter whether Osler was joking or not. It is not my plan\r\nor purpose to write anybody’s speech or essay; but, where there is a\r\nsubject of real importance to be discussed by word or pen, I am willing\r\nto direct the preparation of the student by telling him or her where the\r\nnecessary information can be had. It would, perhaps, not be improper for\r\nme to suggest some general ideas on the subject to be discussed—these\r\nideas to be worked out and put in form by the student. Often I may render\r\ngood service to the boys and girls by telling them where the books they\r\nneed can be bought at the lowest price. It took me many years to learn\r\nhow to buy books, and it is a thing worth knowing—unless you have more\r\nmoney than I ever had.\r\n\r\nThe letters written to me in this department will be published as\r\nwritten; but the names of the writers will be withheld. Therefore, no\r\ncorrespondent need be embarrassed in making inquiries. My replies will be\r\ngiven in the Magazine.\r\n\r\nHereafter all letters asking for information—historical, literary,\r\npolitical, economic—will be answered through the EDUCATIONAL DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\n                                                                 T.

Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga._\r\n\r\n        DEAR SIR: Would you kindly contribute to your magazine an\r\n      article something like this:\r\n\r\n        “Should a young man enter politics?”\r\n\r\n        I have always had a strong desire to enter politics, and\r\n      have thought the matter over a long time, but have as yet\r\n      failed to reach a conclusion. If you can do me the very\r\n      great favor to advise me on this line you may feel assured\r\n      of my hearty appreciation.\r\n\r\n                         Faithfully your friend,\r\n\r\n                                                          C—— W——.\r\n\r\nIt all depends on the motive. A young man who feels the inclination\r\nto enter politics for the purpose of contributing his share to honest\r\nadministration should, by all means, do so.\r\n\r\nGovernment does not take care of itself any more than a cotton crop does.\r\nBoth require cultivation, management, head-work and hand-work.\r\n\r\nWe can never have good government unless good men become interested in\r\npolitics. Perhaps there is not a nobler calling known to man than that\r\nof working for the public welfare in matters governmental—and this is\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\nA high-minded, warm-hearted philanthropist, like Mr. J. G. Phelps-Stokes,\r\nof New York, acts admirably when he ministers to the poor in the slums;\r\nbut his work is still more effective when he gives his thought and his\r\nwork to the removal of those abuses of government which produce the\r\ngreater part of the miseries of those slums.\r\n\r\nThe grandest task which human intellect can set for itself today is\r\nthe redemption of the government from the usurpers who have used the\r\nmachinery of government to enrich themselves and to plunder their less\r\nfortunate brothers.\r\n\r\nIt is true that Henry Clay advised his sons, “Be dogs rather than\r\npoliticians,” but this exclamation was made when Mr. Clay was in a fury\r\nof disappointment because he could not get to be President.\r\n\r\nIt is true that John C. Calhoun and Daniel Webster died broken and\r\ndisappointed men, but Mr. Webster had also set his heart upon being\r\nPresident, and Mr. Calhoun had devoted himself to an impossible program.\r\n\r\nIf a young man enters politics for the mere sake of getting office or\r\npersonal advancement, his motives are sordid, and his life will be worth\r\nnothing to his fellow-man and nothing creditable to himself; but, if in\r\nconjunction with honorable ambition, he entertains the earnest desire to\r\nbe useful to the community in which he lives by exercising his energies\r\nin political work, there is a glorious field for him.\r\n\r\nIf this combination of motives inspires you, my young friend, by all\r\nmeans yield to your inclination and “enter politics.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                  DICKINSON COLLEGE, CARLISLE, PA.,\r\n                                                    April 1, 1905.\r\n\r\n      _Mr. Thomas Watson,\r\n         121 West Forty-second Street, New York City._\r\n\r\n        DEAR SIR: Being in the midst of preparations for a\r\n      scholastic debate to be held here on the —th, kindly permit\r\n      me to ask your views on the following: Our question is,\r\n      “_Resolved_, that the Government should own and control all\r\n      the railway lines.”\r\n\r\n        What, in your opinion, are the strongest arguments to\r\n      sustain the affirmative side of this question?\r\n\r\n        Thanking you for this favor, I remain,\r\n\r\n                         Very respectfully,\r\n\r\n                                                             E——.\r\n\r\nThe strongest arguments in favor of government ownership of railroads\r\nare:\r\n\r\n_First._ Under modern conditions, the railroads are simply the public\r\nhighways over which freight and passengers must pass, and public highways\r\nshould never be owned by private citizens.\r\n\r\nIf freight and passengers go by water route, they must use navigable\r\nrivers, bays, gulfs, oceans. These public waterways belong to the public,\r\nand all men admit that they should.\r\n\r\nUnder modern conditions, freight and passengers are compelled to go\r\nby rail. We have to use the railroads whether we want to or not. In\r\ntraveling any distance, it is no longer possible for the public to\r\ntransact business by the use of the dirt roads, consequently the\r\ntransportation lines are public in their nature and their uses, and\r\nshould belong to the public.\r\n\r\nThey were not built by private capital, as a rule. In almost every\r\ncase the railroads were paid for by public and private donations, and\r\nthe charters granted represented simply a license issued for a public\r\npurpose; and of course that license can be revoked at any time, just\r\ncompensation for vested interests first having been paid.\r\n\r\n_Second._ As now operated, the railroads are ruinously oppressive in\r\ntheir charges. Enormous sums of money are being wrung from the people to\r\npay dividends on watered stock—a fictitious value which has no existence\r\nexcept in ink on paper.\r\n\r\n_Third._ Under the present system, the railroads have co-operated with\r\nexcessive tariff rates in building up the trust, which publicly says to\r\nthe people: “Pay my price for food, or starve”; “Pay my price for tools\r\nto work with, or let your fields become deserts.”\r\n\r\nBy the secret rebate, by discriminations of one kind or another, the\r\nindependent operator has been driven out of the field everywhere and the\r\ntyranny of the trusts established.\r\n\r\n_Fourth._ It would remove the greater part of the corruption which is the\r\nbane of our politics.\r\n\r\nRailroad corporations maintain their lobbyists at the capital of the\r\nnation and at the capital of every state. They corrupt representatives,\r\njudges, aldermen, editors, politicians.\r\n\r\nThey finance national and local campaigns; their filthy finger-prints are\r\nto be found on almost every page of our public record.\r\n\r\nThe only possible way to get rid of this is to remove the motive. Put the\r\nrailroads where the Post-Office Department is, and there will be no more\r\nmotive for rebates, discriminations and wholesale bribery than there is\r\nin the operation of the Post-Office Department.\r\n\r\n_Fifth._ Government ownership would make the service uniform, simplify it\r\nin every way and save vast sums by the consolidation of all the various\r\nlines into one great national system.\r\n\r\nIt would not need so many high-priced presidents, high-priced lawyers and\r\nhigh-priced lobbyists.\r\n\r\nOne very intelligent writer upon this subject, C. Wood Davis, figures out\r\na saving of $160,000,000 on this item by consolidation.\r\n\r\nGovernment ownership would abolish deadheadism.\r\n\r\nUnder our present system, the men who are most able to pay their way on\r\nthe railroad ride free. The man who is least able to pay, not only has to\r\npay for himself, but in the long run has to pay also for the deadheads\r\nwho ride free. This will become obvious to anybody who will think about\r\nit for a moment.\r\n\r\n_Sixth._ It would take away the power of the railroads to destroy any\r\nindividual, any business or any community. It would save the thousands\r\nof lives which are now lost every year for lack of double tracks, safety\r\nappliances and reasonable hours of labor.\r\n\r\nIt would enable the cotton grower of the South to exchange his products\r\nwith the corn grower of the West in such a way that the railroad would\r\nnot get more for hauling the corn than the man who raised it got for it\r\nwhen he sold it.\r\n\r\nAt present the Southern farmer pays seventy-five and eighty cents per\r\nbushel, cash, for corn which the farmer of the West sold for thirty-five\r\ncents. The transportation companies get the lion’s share of that enormous\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\nIt would put an end to strikes, and would put into the hands of the\r\npeople a weapon with which they could destroy any combine among\r\ncapitalists in any article of commerce.\r\n\r\nAmong other things, it would save the tremendous sum of $65,000,000 which\r\nthe Federal Government now pays to the railroads every year for the\r\ncarriage of the mails, and that saving could be applied to extending the\r\nRural Free Delivery to the remotest parts of the country.\r\n\r\nIf the Government owned the railroads and carried its own mails in steel\r\ncars, the Post-Office Department would show a profit instead of a loss,\r\nand railway mail clerks would be able to insure their lives. At present\r\nthey cannot insure their lives, for the reason that the Government\r\nallows them to be hauled around in flimsy dry-goods boxes, whose cost of\r\nconstruction is less than the annual rent which our Government pays for\r\ntheir use and which invariably get smashed to splinters whenever there is\r\na collision.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                                 LOCUST GROVE, GA.,\r\n                                                   April 21, 1905.\r\n\r\n      _Hon. Thomas E. Watson,\r\n         Thomson, Ga._\r\n\r\n        MY DEAR SIR: As affirmative debaters on the subject:\r\n      “_Resolved_, That the democratic principles of the United\r\n      States are in danger of being superseded by those of an\r\n      aristocracy,” we have secured very valuable help from your\r\n      articles in the April number of TOM WATSON’S MAGAZINE,\r\n      and knowing that you, being a student of political\r\n      economy, could give us some personal suggestions, we would\r\n      appreciate your sending us material on the subject at our\r\n      expense.\r\n\r\n                      Very respectfully yours,\r\n\r\n                                                           —— ——.\r\n\r\nA Democracy—it being the government of all by all and for the benefit of\r\nall—cannot continue to be a true democracy unless the laws conform to the\r\ndemocratic standard laid down by Thomas Jefferson—namely, “_Equal and\r\nexact justice to all men, without special favors to any_.”\r\n\r\nAn Aristocracy is a government in which the few make the laws for their\r\nown benefit, and rule the country for their own good.\r\n\r\nTherefore it must be apparent to the most casual student that if we,\r\nby law, confer special favors upon any class of our citizens, we are\r\nbuilding up an aristocracy and are departing from democratic principles.\r\n\r\n(1) For instance, the power to create money and to regulate the volume\r\nthereof is a sovereign power belonging to the state.\r\n\r\nIn countries ruled by kings that power has always been one of the\r\nprerogatives of the crown, as was the power to make war and peace, to\r\nnegotiate treaties and to levy taxes. It was recognized that the king\r\ncould not continue in the full exercise of his kingly authority if he\r\nparted with the tremendous power of creating money.\r\n\r\nNot until the English crown rested upon the head of the most dissolute\r\nof the Stuarts, Charles II, and he had become the slave of an abandoned\r\nwoman—who was in turn the tool of a grasping corporation, the East India\r\nCompany—was the power to create money transferred from the king to a\r\ncorporation.\r\n\r\nEver since that day Great Britain has suffered from this surrender of\r\nsovereign power, and it was this mistake of the king which Alexander\r\nHamilton, either through mistake or by design, adopted when he came to\r\nframe a financial system for the American people.\r\n\r\nIt was his express purpose to create an aristocracy of wealth, and he\r\nmust have realized that when he took from the government the power to\r\ncreate money and put it into the hands of a private corporation he was\r\ncreating an aristocracy of wealth.\r\n\r\nThe national banks of today represent an aristocracy of wealth, supported\r\nby the governmental function of creating currency.\r\n\r\nThere are, in round numbers, 5,000 national bankers who have in\r\ncirculation $400,000,000 of their “promises to pay,” which the law\r\npractically makes legal tender.\r\n\r\nIn other words, their _“promises to pay” are used as money_.\r\n\r\nThere are 80,000,000 natural persons in this country; there are 5,000\r\ncorporations called national banks! The 80,000,000 natural persons may\r\nsign promissory notes for five dollars each, and these notes are simply\r\ncommercial paper, having no circulation as money. The 5,000 national\r\nbanks sign their promissory notes to the same amount—$400,000,000—and\r\nthese notes constitute, for all practical purposes, a national currency—a\r\nnational money.\r\n\r\n_The law gives them the special privilege of getting rich on what\r\nthey owe._ They have also the more dangerous power of _enlarging and\r\ncontracting the volume of currency, thus unsettling values, destroying\r\nmarkets and producing panics, as they did in 1893_.\r\n\r\n(2) The democratic principle of equal and exact justice to all men\r\nrequires that the government should derive its revenue from a system\r\nof taxation which deals fairly with every citizen. Each man should\r\ncontribute to the support of the government in proportion to his ability.\r\nAnd taxes should not be laid for the purpose of building up one man’s\r\nbusiness at the expense of another’s.\r\n\r\nOur tariff system, from which the government derives the greater part of\r\nits revenue, violates democratic principles.\r\n\r\nIts purpose and result is to build up manufacturers at the expense of\r\neverybody not engaged in manufacturing. It gives the manufacturer a price\r\nwhich he could not get without the law which insures him the monopoly of\r\nthe home market. _All the world can compete with our laborers by sending\r\nimmigrants to our shores; all the world can compete with our farmers;\r\nbut nobody is allowed to compete with our manufacturers_, AND THE RESULT\r\nIS THE TRUST, under which Americans combine to rob the helpless American\r\ncitizen, who is not allowed to buy his food or his clothing or tools to\r\nwork with from anyone except the American manufacturer.\r\n\r\nBy this system, which lays the taxes on the things which man buys, a\r\ncitizen who is worth only a few hundred or a few thousand dollars pays\r\njust as much to the support of the Federal Government as is paid by the\r\nman who is worth tens of millions of dollars.\r\n\r\nConsequently the inevitable tendency of the tariff system is to create\r\na class which controls the government for its own enrichment; _in other\r\nwords, an aristocracy_.\r\n\r\n(3) Consider our corporation laws. Early in the history of our Government\r\nChief Justice John Marshall decided that a charter granted to a\r\ncorporation was a contract and could not be changed by the sovereign\r\npower of the state. This decision was not good law, and no good lawyer\r\nhas ever considered it so. John Marshall had a great mind, but he\r\nwas one of the rankest partisans that ever lived. He stretched every\r\nconstitutional power in the effort to build up what Hamilton wanted—an\r\naristocracy of wealth.\r\n\r\n_Just as a natural person is born into a community and lives in it\r\nsubject to having his status changed by the will of the majority,\r\nexpressed in a legal way, so a corporation, born into a community through\r\nits charter, should have been required to take the same chance of having\r\nits status changed, in a legal way, by the will of the majority._\r\n\r\nA railroad corporation comes to the legislature and procures a charter to\r\nbuild a railroad; _but the state cannot compel the corporation to build\r\nthat railroad._ In other words, the state cannot compel the execution of\r\nthe powers granted under the charter; therefore _such a charter lacks the\r\nvery first element of a contract, because a contract is one in which each\r\nparty can be compelled to perform his part or pay consequent damages_.\r\nBut, in pursuance of the decision of John Marshall in the Dartmouth\r\nCollege case, our state and national governments have erected a rule of\r\nthe corporations, and they are now more powerful than the governments\r\nwhich created them.\r\n\r\nThe great transportation companies exercise the power to tax, and the\r\npeople, who pay the taxes, have no representation in the councils of\r\nthose who levy the taxes. This surely constitutes an aristocracy of the\r\nmost powerful kind.\r\n\r\nThe railroads have the power to tax the life out of any industry, out of\r\nany section, out of any city or town; _with rebates and discriminations\r\nthey build up the Trusts which plunder the people_.\r\n\r\nBy reason of the fact that they enjoy the privilege of taxing other\r\npeople, _they pay no Federal taxes to support the government_. Whatever\r\nthey may pay in the way of tariff on material which they use in the\r\nconstruction of roadbeds and rolling stock, they simply charge up to\r\nexpense account and levy their rates so as to make the utmost possible\r\nprofit over and above what they have paid out. The public cannot escape\r\nthe freight rates and the passenger rates which the corporations levy.\r\nThe public cannot help itself. The public is made to pay, in those\r\nfreight and passenger rates, every dollar of tax which the railroads\r\nhave paid to the state and Federal governments. Therefore, as in the\r\ncase of the national banks and the manufacturers, we have a great class\r\nof corporations given special powers by law which are exercised at the\r\nexpense of the masses of the people, and which escape all the burden\r\nof supporting the national Government by reason of the immunities and\r\nprivileges which the law has made for their exclusive benefit.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have a complete illustration of aristocracy—the government\r\nof the few, by the few and for the few, instead of the ideal of Jefferson\r\nand Lincoln, “government of the people, by the people and for the people.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe man who makes a corner in wheat thinks he can relieve all the\r\nsuffering he caused by endowing a bed in a hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _The Track Walker_\r\n\r\n                           BY THEODORE DREISER\r\n                       _Author of “Sister Carrie”_\r\n\r\n\r\n                         TRACK WALKER KILLED\r\n\r\n        WESTFIELD, N.

While you are sitting in your seat placidly\r\nwondering whether you are going to have a pleasant evening at the theatre\r\nor whether the business to which you are about to attend will be as\r\nprofitable as you desire, he is out on the long track over which you\r\nare speeding, calmly examining the bolts that hold the shining metals\r\ntogether. Neither rain nor sleet can deter him. The presence of intense\r\nheat or intense cold has no effect on his labors. Day after day, at all\r\nhours and in all sorts of weather, he may be seen placidly plodding these\r\niron highways, his wrench and sledge crossed over his shoulders, his eyes\r\nriveted on the rails, carefully watching to see whether any bolts are\r\nloose or any spikes sprung. Upward of two hundred cannon-ball flyers rush\r\nby him on what might be called a four-track bowling alley each day, and\r\nyet he dodges them all for perhaps as little as any laborer is paid. If\r\nhe were not watchful, if he did not perform his work carefully and well,\r\nif he had a touch of malice or a feeling of vengefulness, he could wreck\r\nyour train, mangle your body and send you praying and screaming to your\r\nMaker. There would be no sure way of detecting him.\r\n\r\nDeath lurks in this tunnel. Here, if anywhere, it may be said to be\r\nconstantly watching. What with the noise, which is a perfect and\r\ncontinuous uproar, the smoke, which hangs like a thick, gloomy pall over\r\neverything, and the weak, ineffective lights which shine out on your near\r\napproach like will-o’-the-wisps, the chances of hearing and seeing the\r\napproach of any particular train are small. Side arches, or small pockets\r\nin the walls, are provided for the protection of the men, but these are\r\nnot always to be reached in time when a train thunders out of the gloom.\r\nIf you look sharp you may sometimes see a figure crouching in one of\r\nthese as you scurry past. He is so close to the grinding wheels that the\r\ndust and soot of them are flung into his very soul.\r\n\r\nAnd yet for all this the money that is paid these men is beggarly small.\r\nThe work that they do is not considered exceptionally valuable. Fifteen\r\ncents an hour is all that they are paid, and this for ten to twelve\r\nhours’ work every day. That their lives are in constant danger is not\r\nof any point in the matter. They are supposed to work willingly for\r\nthis, and they do. Only when one is picked off and his body mangled by a\r\npassing train is the grimness of the sacrifice emphasized, and then only\r\nfor a moment. The space which such accident gets in the public prints is\r\nscarcely more than a line.\r\n\r\nAnd now what would you say of men who would do this work for fifteen\r\ncents an hour? What estimate would you put on their mental capacity?\r\nWould you say that they are only worth what they can be made to work\r\nfor? One of these men, an intelligent type of laborer, not a drinker,\r\nand one who did not even smoke, attracted the writer’s attention by the\r\npunctuality with which he crossed a given spot on his beat. He was a\r\nmiddle-aged man, married, and had three children. Day after day, week\r\nafter week, he used to arrive at this particular spot, his eye alert, his\r\nstep quick, and when a train approached he seemed to become aware of it\r\nas if by instinct. When finally asked by the writer why he did not get\r\nsomething better to do he said, “I have no trade. Where could I get more?”\r\n\r\nThis man was killed by a train. Sure as was his instinct and keen his\r\neye, he was nevertheless caught one evening, and at the very place where\r\nhe deemed himself most sure. His head was completely obliterated, and he\r\nhad to be identified by his clothes. When he was removed another eager\r\napplicant was given his place, and now he is walking in the tunnel with a\r\nhalf-dozen others. If you question these men they will all tell you the\r\nsame story. They do not want to do what they are doing, but it is better\r\nthan nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _The House of Cards_\r\n\r\n\r\n    So high I built it, high—\r\n      With love and tenderness to make it strong,\r\n    And thought me—foolish, blind—\r\n      That I should keep it all the ages long.\r\n\r\n    So firm I built it, firm—\r\n      And joyed when raging storms around it blew\r\n    To see how stanch it stood,\r\n      My house of cards, in every part so true.\r\n\r\n    So fair it was, so fair—\r\n      And how I loved it with its gables high\r\n    Piercing horizon’s rim,\r\n      And with the lark far to the quiet sky.\r\n\r\n    So much I loved, so much—\r\n      I almost thought when close within its gate,\r\n    That Heaven had naught to give.\r\n      One dashed it down—and I am desolate.\r\n\r\n                                      RUTH STERRY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _Royal Road to Wealth_\r\n\r\n\r\nCOBWIGGER—If you take advantage of your opportunities you will be in\r\ncomfortable circumstances.\r\n\r\nFREDDIE—What must you do in order to get rich, dad?\r\n\r\nCOBWIGGER—Take advantage of other people’s opportunities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _The Say of Other Editors_\r\n\r\n\r\n                        “A FREE BREAKFAST TABLE”\r\n\r\nThe recent suggestion of a tariff tax on coffee, probably put out as a\r\nfeeler, is responsible for the resurrection and reintroduction of the\r\nonce familiar but never appropriate phrase at the head of this article.\r\nIt was never appropriate; it was always a sarcastic sneer, rather than a\r\nstatement of fact, because the memory of the most aged citizen runneth\r\nnot to the time when “a free breakfast table,” a breakfast table untaxed\r\nas to itself, its equipment and the food and drink it bore, could be\r\nfound in any American home. At this time, under the tariff of 1897, what\r\ncould be more preposterously absurd than the notion that a tax on coffee\r\nwould be a decree of banishment for that alleged boon?\r\n\r\nThe _Post_, being an advocate and defender of the policy of protection,\r\nalthough a condemner and contemner of the outrages incident to the\r\nstand-pat policy, is in no hurry to witness the advent of “a free\r\nbreakfast table”; but the _Post_ prefers that such a crass absurdity,\r\nsuch a stinging satire as this old shibboleth, should be returned\r\nforthwith to the dust and darkness from which it was dragged when the\r\ncoffee tax proposition appeared.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, you go to breakfast clad in taxed garments, wearing no\r\nsingle article that is not taxed in the tariff; you sit in a chair that\r\nis taxed as to all the various materials that enter into it, and taxed\r\nas a whole; the table itself is similarly taxed, and we can think of no\r\narticle on it that is free. Your tablecloth, your napkins and your napkin\r\nrings are all in the tariff schedules. Your fish or meat, your vegetables\r\nand fruit, your bread, your butter, your rolls, your griddle cakes, your\r\nsugar and syrup, your salt, vinegar, pepper, mustard, olive oil and all\r\nother condiments show up in the list of things taxed. So is it with your\r\nchina or other crockery, and your knives, forks and spoons.\r\n\r\nAnd your coffee is free only as to the raw bean. It is roasted over a\r\ntaxed fire and in a taxed roaster, is stored in taxed receptacles and\r\ntransported by taxed horses in taxed wagons; when retailed, it goes out\r\nin taxed bags, to be deposited in other taxed vessels. Having been ground\r\nin a taxed mill, your cook prepares it for the table by using a taxed\r\ncoffee pot. If you use cream in your “free” coffee you must use taxed\r\ncream; if you use sugar in it you must use taxed sugar.\r\n\r\nThis is the “free breakfast table” whose exit will come if a duty is\r\nimposed on the raw coffee bean!—_Washington Post._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat familiar old hymn, “In This Wheat By and Bye,” has lost its\r\nattractions for Jawn W.

He can sit in his palace and\r\nrake in 45 per cent. of the customs revenues of his republic, collected\r\nfor him and scrupulously accounted for. That was what Morales wanted, and\r\nhe is happy. Domestic malice, foreign levy—nothing can touch him further.\r\n\r\nIf Cipriano Castro had one-tenth of the ingenuity of his brother bandit\r\nof the black republic he would have seen long ago that his present\r\npolicy is foolish. Instead of making faces at the United States, Castro\r\nshould have been busy inducing the foreigners in his country to set up\r\na concurrent roar. He should have acknowledged the validity of claims\r\nof any kind and to any amount, the bigger the better. Then, at the\r\npsychological moment, he should have pointed to the imminent danger to\r\nthe Monroe Doctrine, and begged the United States to enter and preserve\r\norder, collect his revenues and pay him a share of the proceeds.\r\n\r\nIf there is any other Central or South American dictator who is shaky\r\non his pins, now is the time he should apply for relief. Let him take a\r\nlesson from Morales and imitate that “prudent and far-seeing statesman.”\r\nForty-five per cent. of the revenues, in clean, hard coin, without work\r\nor worry, is better than all the revenues with danger of revolution and\r\ndismemberment.\r\n\r\nStep up, gentlemen! The United States has a big navy, and it has nothing\r\nto do at home. Our duty is to protect our weak and struggling sister\r\nrepublics, and now that the Senate is out of the way, we propose to do\r\nit.

The great success of the Standard Oil\r\nrobberies has spawned upon the country hundreds of such corporations that\r\nplunder the public with even more skill than the Standard. If the church\r\naccepts this donation it will be as fatal to it as the thirty pieces of\r\nsilver were to Judas. This protest against the gift by these ministers\r\nis a most courageous act. The Standard Oil tactics may lose every one of\r\nthem their pulpits. The Standard Oil management will stoop to any kind\r\nof dirty work to perpetuate the system. They are attempting now to ruin\r\nLawson, and, with all his astuteness and his millions of wealth to back\r\nhim, they may succeed in doing so. The people should stand by Lawson to a\r\nman, and the congregations of these ministers that have dared to affront\r\nRockefeller should see that none of his poisoned arrows reach them.—_The\r\nForum, Denver, Col._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                         CHRISTIAN CIVILIZATION\r\n\r\nWe hear much of Christian Civilization, but we do not see so much of it.\r\nLet us consider briefly the Christian world:\r\n\r\nRussia—Anarchy, rapine, bloodshed, pauperism and starvation.\r\n\r\nAustro-Hungary—Disease, strife, strikes, poverty and pauperism of\r\nmillions.\r\n\r\nItaly—Overpopulation, dire poverty, with millions of the people actual\r\nbeggars, excessive taxation and a practically bankrupt treasury.\r\n\r\nEngland—Army of unemployed, a vast section of the population in a poverty\r\nso appalling that it makes one’s heart bleed to read the details.\r\n\r\nIreland—Practically a nation of paupers, not of their own volition\r\neither, but as a result of evil laws and customs which have destroyed the\r\nhopes of a gallant people.\r\n\r\nSpain—Once the proud leader of nations, reduced to the rags and sores of\r\nLazarus.\r\n\r\nUnited States—In the grasp of graft, the people being robbed of their\r\nearnings at every turn by a lot of as conscienceless pirates as ever\r\nscuttled a ship, and a government apparently impotent.\r\n\r\nEverywhere we find more or less the same evil conditions.\r\n\r\nOur so-called Christian Civilization is as much like the genuine article\r\nas the Texas long-horn is like a thoroughbred Holstein.—_The Commonweal,\r\nAtlanta, Ga._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI interpret Dr. Osler to mean: Young man, get a move on you if you want\r\nto amount to anything.

And the\r\nslaves do not realize that they have owners. Formerly one man owned one,\r\na dozen or a hundred slaves. Occasionally even more than that. Now a\r\nhundred thousand men each own a part of every slave. The great mass of\r\nthe people are slaves to unjust systems, and everyone who profits by\r\nthese systems is part owner of everyone who loses by them. If there\r\ncould be a partition suit and every slave owner be set apart his share,\r\nthe fact that there are slaves today, and millions of them, would be\r\nquite plain. It would be found that this man owns fifty slaves, that man\r\na hundred and some as high as fifty thousand. Should the richest girl in\r\nthe United States be given white girls only as her share of the slaves,\r\nshe would have a thousand at least—a thousand white girl slaves. Some\r\npersons are part slave and part free, because they get a little more\r\nthan the commonest kind of a living. Sixty million people in the United\r\nStates are either all or part slave, and the number who are all slave is\r\nmuch greater than that of the black population in the days of chattel\r\nslavery. This new slavery exists because the owners do not realize that\r\nthey are owners and the slaves do not realize that they are slaves.

Armstrong made this statement in addressing a jury in\r\nthe case of a man killed at the plant of the American Steel and Wire\r\nCompany. It was only a case of “another Hungarian killed in the mills,”\r\nas the Coroner expressed it, but Adelbert Merle, the Austro-Hungarian\r\nConsul-General in this city, backed by the Coroner, will appeal to the\r\nstate, and, if necessary, to the Federal authorities, to do something to\r\nprotect these men.\r\n\r\n“During the first month of my term,” said Coroner Armstrong, “one plant\r\nalone, the Duquesne plant of the United States Steel Corporation, had\r\ntwelve separate fatalities. That was the number reported to this office.\r\nHow many more there were no one may ever know. I went to the officials of\r\nthe corporation and entered a complaint. Then an order was issued that\r\nmore care would have to be taken, and next month not a death was reported\r\nfrom the Duquesne plant.”\r\n\r\nSaid Consul-General Merle:\r\n\r\n“A very large number of the Hungarians employed in the mills are American\r\ncitizens, and some consideration should be given them on that account, if\r\nnot on the score of humanity. It is proposed to organize the Hungarians\r\nand other foreigners who are voters and see if some action cannot be\r\nsecured in the legislature to compel the mill owners to give better\r\nprotection to the workmen.”\r\n\r\n“The number of fatalities which occur in the steel mills, the blast\r\nfurnaces and the coal mines in the Pittsburg district are never fully\r\nreported,” said an attaché of the consulate. “Scarcely a month goes by\r\nthat we are not called upon to investigate the case of some workman who\r\nis reported to us as having ‘disappeared.’ At present we are working on\r\ntwo such cases. Both are identical as regards details.\r\n\r\n“The men were stationed at the top of blast furnaces owned by the United\r\nStates Steel Corporation to receive the cars of ore as they came up and\r\ndump them. There is only a small bridge for them to stand on. One misstep\r\nor awkward movement, and the man will follow the ore into the furnace.\r\nThe men are not missed until it is noticed that the cars are not being\r\ndumped. No one knows what has become of them. Their coats and dinner\r\npails await them at the bottom of the elevator, but the men never come\r\nto claim them. Then they are reported to have ‘disappeared.’ It is not\r\nknown positively that they have fallen into the furnace, but there can be\r\nno other conclusion.”\r\n\r\nThe officials of the steel mills say they will do anything in their power\r\nto conduce to the safety of the men, and that the foremen in charge are\r\nmainly responsible for any dereliction.—_New York World._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf a man should loan money at one-half of 1 per cent., and borrow it back\r\nat 8 per cent., and keep this up year after year, his family would have\r\nno trouble in getting him put under guardianship.

Surely a\r\nsystem of physical training which has done so much for the Island Nation\r\nwill interest you. Jiu-Jitsu not only embodies the ideal principles of\r\nattaining perfect health and perfect physical development, but as a means\r\nof self-defense it is as potent at short range as the deadliest weapon.\r\nA knowledge of its self-preserving principles renders a man or woman\r\nimpregnable to every form of vicious attack.\r\n\r\nJealously Guarded Secrets Revealed.\r\n\r\nFor over two thousand years the principles of Jiu-Jitsu have been\r\nreligiously guarded. By an imperial edict the teaching of the system\r\nwas forbidden outside of Japan. The friendly feeling, however, existing\r\nbetween Japan and the United States has been instrumental in releasing\r\nJiu-Jitsu from its oath-bound secrecy, and I have been delegated to\r\nteach, without reserve, all the secrets of this ancient art to Americans.\r\n\r\nI have just written an intensely interesting book which explains and\r\nmakes clear the principles of Jiu-Jitsu in a manner which will never be\r\napproached by any American writer. So long as the edition lasts this\r\nbook, together with my first lesson in Jiu-Jitsu, will be sent free to\r\ninterested persons. The lesson is fully illustrated and teaches one of\r\nthe most effective methods known for disposing of a dangerous antagonist.\r\n\r\nIf you desire to learn all the closely guarded secrets of this marvelous\r\nscience send your name and address, and you will receive the book and\r\nspecimen lesson by return mail, postage paid.\r\n\r\nAddress YAE KICHI YABE, 192T Realty Bldg., Rochester, N.

Tonics and lotions\r\napplied to the outside of the scalp do soften the hair—but that’s all.\r\nBy exercising the arms, we build up muscle—_not_ by outside applications\r\nof medicine. The arms, the body and the lower limbs can be exercised at\r\nwill—but the _scalp_ requires mechanical aid. Exercise makes the blood\r\ncirculate, lack of exercise makes it stagnant. The Vacuum method is the\r\nkind of exercise that makes the blood circulate. It gently draws the\r\nrich blood to the scalp and feeds the shrunken hair roots. This causes\r\nthe hair to grow. It is the simple, common-sense principle of physical\r\nculture applied to the scalp.\r\n\r\nOur Guarantee (backed by the Bank):\r\n\r\nWe will send you, by prepaid express, an Evans Vacuum Cap, allowing you\r\nample time to prove its virtue, and all we ask of you is to deposit the\r\nprice of the appliance in the Jefferson Bank of St. Louis during the\r\ntrial period, subject to _your own order_. If you do not cultivate a\r\nsufficient growth of hair to convince you that this method is effective,\r\nsimply notify the bank and they will return your deposit.\r\n\r\nA sixteen-page book, illustrated, will be sent you free.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nEvans Vacuum Cap Co.\r\n\r\n669 Fullerton Building\r\n\r\nSt. Louis\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEYEGLASSES NOT NECESSARY\r\n\r\nEyesight Can Be Strengthened and All Forms of Diseased Eyes Cured Without\r\nCutting or Drugging.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThat the eyes can be strengthened so that eyeglasses can be dispensed\r\nwith in the great majority of cases has been proven beyond a doubt by the\r\ntestimony of thousands of people who have been cured by that wonderful\r\nlittle instrument called “Actina.” Actina also cures sore and granulated\r\nlids, Glaucoma, Iritis, &c., also removes Cataracts and Pterygiums,\r\nwithout cutting or drugging. Over seventy thousand Actinas have been\r\nsold, therefore it is not an experiment, but an absolute fact. The\r\nfollowing letters are but samples of those that are received daily:—\r\n\r\n        Mrs. M. E. Champney, 242 West 135th st., New York City,\r\n      writes:—“The ‘Actina’ cured me of Iritis, after the doctors\r\n      said there was no cure outside an operation. I have been\r\n      entirely well for over four months, can see to read and sew\r\n      as well as before. I can honestly recommend ‘Actina’ for\r\n      all afflictions of the eye.”\r\n\r\n        Emily Knapp, 920 Galina st., Milwaukee, Wis., writes:—“The\r\n      ‘Actina’ I purchased from you a year ago saved my brother’s\r\n      eyesight. My brother was near-sighted, wore number five and\r\n      six glasses, and now he can go to school and do all his\r\n      work and study without glasses.”\r\n\r\nE. R. Holdbrook, Deputy County Clerk, Fairfax, Va., writes:—“‘Actina’\r\nhas cured my eyes so that I can do without glasses. I very seldom have\r\nheadache now, and can study up to eleven o’clock after a hard day’s work\r\nat the office.”\r\n\r\nActina is not a drug or a lotion, but a small pocket battery, which can\r\nbe used by old and young with perfect safety. It is impossible to do harm\r\nwith Actina. Every member of the family can use the one Actina for any\r\nform of disease of the Eye, Ear, Throat or Head. Actina will last for\r\nyears, and is always ready for use. Actina will be sent on trial postpaid.\r\n\r\nIf you send your name and address to the New York & London Electric\r\nAssociation, Dept. 37N, 929 Walnut St., Kansas City, Mo., you will\r\nreceive absolutely FREE a valuable book—, Professor Wilson’s Treatise on\r\nthe Eye and on Diseases in General.
