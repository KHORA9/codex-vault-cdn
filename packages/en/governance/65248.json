These changes are indeed long overdue. They\r\nought to have come more than a century ago, because it had then already\r\nbecome manifest that the Turk was hopelessly unfit to govern, with any\r\napproach to justice, subject races of a different religion. The Turk\r\nhas never been of any use for any purpose except fighting. He cannot\r\nadminister, though in his earlier days he had the sense to employ\r\nintelligent Christian administrators. He cannot secure justice. As a\r\ngoverning power, he has always shown himself incapable, corrupt and\r\ncruel. He has always destroyed; he has never created.\r\n\r\nThose whom we call the Turks are not a nation at all in the proper\r\nsense of the word. The Ottoman Turks were a small conquering tribe from\r\nCentral Asia, ruled during the first two centuries of their conquests by\r\na succession of singularly able and unscrupulous Sultans, who subjugated\r\nthe Christian populations of Asia Minor and South-Eastern Europe,\r\ncompelling part of these populations to embrace Mohammedanism, and\r\nsupporting their own power by seizing the children of the rest, forcibly\r\nconverting them to Islam, and making out of them an efficient standing\r\narmy, the Janizaries, by whose valour and discipline the Turkish wars\r\nof conquest were carried on from early in the fifteenth down into the\r\nnineteenth century. As a famous English historian wrote, the Turks are\r\nnothing but a robber band, encamped in the countries they have desolated.\r\nAs Edmund Burke wrote, the Turks are savages, with whom no civilised\r\nChristian nation ought to form any alliance.\r\n\r\nTurkish rule ought to be ended in Europe, because, even in that\r\nsmall part of it which the Sultan still holds, it is an alien power,\r\nwhich has in that region been, and is now, oppressing or massacring,\r\nslaughtering or driving from their homes, the Christian population of\r\nGreek or Bulgarian stock. It ought to be turned out of the western coast\r\nregions of Asia Minor for a like reason. The people there are largely,\r\nperhaps mostly, Greek-speaking Christians. So ought it to be turned\r\nout of Constantinople, a city of incomparable commercial and political\r\nimportance, with the guardianship of which it is unfit to be trusted. So\r\nought it to be turned out of Armenia and Cilicia, and Syria, where within\r\nthe last two years it has been destroying its Christian subjects, the\r\nmost peaceful and industrious and intelligent part of the population.\r\n\r\nIf a Turkish Sultanate is to be left in being at all, it may, with\r\nleast injury to the world, be suffered to exist in Central and Northern\r\nAsia Minor, where the population is mainly Mussulman, and there are\r\ncomparatively few Christians—and those only in the cities—to suffer\r\nfrom its misgovernment. Even there one would be sorry for its subjects,\r\nMussulman as well as Christian, but a weak Turkish State, such as it\r\nwould then be, could not venture on the crimes of which it has been\r\nguilty when it was comparatively strong.\r\n\r\nThat the faults of Turkish government are incurable, has been most\r\nclearly shown by the fact that the Young Turkish gang who gained power\r\nwhen they had deposed Abd-ul-Hamid, have surpassed even that monster of\r\ncruelty in their slaughter of the unoffending Armenians. The “Committee\r\nof Union and Progress” began by promising equal rights to all races and\r\nfaiths. This was “Union.” It proceeded forthwith not only to expel the\r\nGreek-speaking inhabitants of Western Asia Minor, and to exterminate the\r\nArmenians, but to attempt to Turkify the Albanians (Muslims as well as\r\nChristians) and to proscribe their language. This is what “Union” has in\r\nfact meant. What “Progress” has meant in the hands of ruffians like Enver\r\nand Talaat, Prussianised Muslims worse than the old Turkish pashas, we\r\nhave all seen within the last three years. The Muslim peasant of Asia\r\nMinor is an honest, kindly fellow when not roused by fanaticism, but the\r\nTurk, as a Governing Power, is irreclaimable, and the Allied Powers would\r\nhave been false to all the principles of Right and Humanity for which\r\nthey are fighting if they had not proclaimed that no Turkish Government\r\nshall hereafter be permitted to tyrannize over subjects of another faith.\r\n\r\n                                                                   BRYCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE MURDEROUS TYRANNY OF THE TURKS.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AIMS OF THE ALLIES.\r\n\r\nPresident Wilson, in his note to all the belligerent governments, called\r\nupon both parties to state in the full light of day the aims they have\r\nset themselves in prosecuting the War. The Allied Nations, in their joint\r\nresponse made public on January 11th, 1917, explain that they find no\r\ndifficulty in meeting this request, and make good their words by stating\r\na series of definite conditions. Among them are:—\r\n\r\n“_The liberation of the peoples who now lie beneath the murderous tyranny\r\nof the Turks; and_\r\n\r\n“_The expulsion from Europe of the Ottoman Empire, which has proved\r\nitself so radically alien to Western Civilisation._”\r\n\r\nThe plan of the Allies for the settlement of Turkey is thus communicated\r\nto the world without reserve, and it is worth examining what it involves,\r\nand why it is right.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUBJECT PEOPLES OF TURKEY.\r\n\r\nWho are the peoples in Turkey whom the Allies are determined to liberate?\r\nThe Ottoman Empire contains somewhat more than 20,000,000 inhabitants,\r\nand of these only about 8,000,000—less than 40 per cent. of the\r\nwhole—are Turks.[1] There are 7,000,000 Arabs; there are 2,000,000\r\nArmenians (or, rather, there were, before the atrocities of 1915); the\r\nGreeks, too, number little short of 2,000,000, and there are probably\r\nthe same number of non-Turkish mountaineers—Kurds, Nestorians, Druses,\r\nMaronites and so on. The non-Turkish peoples thus amount to more than 60\r\nper cent. of the population of Turkey. They were all of them settled in\r\nthe country before the Turks arrived—the Turks conquered Asia Minor about\r\nthe time the Normans conquered England, while several of the conquered\r\nraces have lived there from time immemorial—and all these races have been\r\nat their lowest ebb since and so long as they have been under Turkish\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks were leaders of civilisation in the Ancient World and in\r\nthe Middle Ages, till the Greek Empire of Constantinople was conquered\r\nby the Turks in 1453. From that moment they dropped out till the War\r\nof Liberation, a century ago, restored part of the Greek nation to\r\nindependence. The Greeks who have remained under Turkish government have\r\nalso remained cut off from Greek national life.\r\n\r\nThe Armenians were the first people to make Christianity their national\r\nreligion. They are an intellectual people, clever and industrious in\r\npractical affairs and in the life of the spirit. When they possessed an\r\nindependent kingdom they produced a fine literature and architecture,\r\nwhich Turkish conquest destroyed. Since then the Turks have repressed all\r\nsymptoms of Armenian revival by massacres, the most terrible of which was\r\nperpetrated last year.\r\n\r\nThe Arabs created a wonderful civilisation at the time when Medieval\r\nEurope was in its darkest age. Their discoveries in mathematics,\r\nastronomy, chemistry, medicine, are the foundations of modern science,\r\nas is witnessed by the Arabic words in our scientific vocabulary. This\r\nArabic civilisation was swamped by the Turkish migrations from Central\r\nAsia in the 11th century, and blotted out by the Mongols, who followed in\r\nthe wake of the Turks and sacked Baghdad, the Arab capital, in the 13th\r\ncentury. The Arabs are still the most progressive race in the Islamic\r\nworld; they are almost as numerous as the Turks in the population of the\r\nOttoman Empire, and they are not divided from the Turks by difference\r\nof religion. Yet the Turkish government excludes them from all share\r\nof control, and has thwarted their revival as persistently as it has\r\nthwarted that of the Armenians and Greeks. They too have been massacred\r\nand exiled during the present War.\r\n\r\nThe Kurds, also, were there before the Turks, but they have not the same\r\ntradition as the other three races behind them. In their case the Turks\r\nhave not destroyed an existing civilisation, but have prevented them\r\nacquiring civilisation when they showed inclination to do so. The Kurd\r\nhas been a lawless mountain shepherd for many centuries, but he becomes\r\na hard-working, peaceable cultivator when he comes down into the plains.\r\nThe Turkish government deliberately checked this tendency, which began to\r\nshow itself in the Kurds about half a century ago, by serving out arms to\r\nthem and licensing them to harry their Armenian neighbours.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MURDEROUS TYRANNY OF THE TURKS: THE FIRST STAGE.\r\n\r\nThis maiming and warping of more gifted peoples is in itself a capital\r\nindictment of Turkish domination, but the wrong is made infinitely worse\r\nby the outrageous methods by which it has been carried out. These methods\r\nare justly described as a “_murderous tyranny_” in the Allies’ Response\r\nto President Wilson’s question.\r\n\r\nThere are three stages in the history of Ottoman tyranny, and the worst\r\nstage is the present. The Ottoman State has been a purely military State\r\nfrom beginning to end. Osman, its founder, from whom the Osmanli Turks\r\ntake their name, was the hereditary chief of a wandering band of Turkish\r\nfreebooters from Central Asia, whose father was licensed by Turkish\r\nSultans already established in Asia Minor to carve out a principality\r\nfor himself at the expense of the neighbouring Christians, just as the\r\nTeutonic knights carved out the principality of Prussia at the expense of\r\nthe original native population. This Ottoman dominion, which started thus\r\nin the 13th century with a few square miles of territory in North-Western\r\nAsia Minor, expanded during the next three hundred years till it\r\nstretched from within a few miles of Vienna to Mecca and Baghdad. It\r\ndestroyed the Ancient Empire of Constantinople, which had preserved Greek\r\nlearning during the Middle Ages; the free Christian kingdoms of Bulgaria,\r\nSerbia, Bosnia, Wallachia, Moldavia and Hungary; and the independent\r\nMoslem states of Western Asia. Such a career of destructive conquest was\r\na disaster to civilisation, and it was only made possible by a ruthless\r\nmilitarism.\r\n\r\nThe Ottoman method of conscription was to take a tribute of children\r\nfrom the conquered Christians—so many children from each family every\r\nso many years—bring them up in barracks as fanatical Moslems and train\r\nthem as professional recruits. These “Janissaries,” militarised from\r\ntheir youth up and divorced from every human relation except loyalty to\r\ntheir war-lord, were the most formidable soldiers in Europe, and each new\r\nChristian land they conquered was a new field of recruitment for their\r\ncorps. The Ottoman Empire literally drained its victims’ blood, and its\r\nhistory as a Vampire-State is unparalleled in the history of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND STAGE: ABD-UL-HAMID.\r\n\r\nThis was the first stage in Ottoman history; the second, inevitable in\r\na purely military state, was internal and external decay. The Empire\r\nwas cut short by Austria, Russia and other foreign powers; the subject\r\npeoples began to win back their freedom by breaking away from under the\r\nTurkish yoke. A good government would have met these dangers by improving\r\nthe conditions of the Empire. It would have tried to make the subject\r\npeoples contented, to give their capacities for development free play,\r\nto build of them a bulwark against outside enemies. But the Turkish\r\ngovernment had not the imagination or the good will to adopt a policy\r\nlike this. It had nothing but its military tradition of violence and\r\ncunning, and it tried to stave off the consequences of its own rottenness\r\nby making the subject peoples even weaker and more wretched than itself.\r\nThis was the policy of Abd-ul-Hamid, who reigned from 1876 to 1908, and\r\nhis method was to set one race against another. The Kurds were encouraged\r\nto massacre the Armenians; the Turkish soldiers were ordered to join in\r\nthe massacre when the Armenians put up a resistance. The Bulgars were\r\nallowed to form armed bands to “Bulgarise” the villages of Macedonia,\r\nand the Greeks to form bands of their own to withstand them; the\r\nMacedonian peasants were harried by both parties, and if they harboured\r\nthe bands to avoid incurring their vengeance, Turkish troops came up and\r\nburned the village for treason against the Ottoman State.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THIRD STAGE: THE YOUNG TURKS.\r\n\r\nIn the first stage the subject peoples paid their tribute of children and\r\nwere then left to themselves. In the second stage they were hounded on\r\nto destroy each other by the Machiavellian policy of Abd-ul-Hamid. The\r\nthird stage has been introduced by the Young Turks, and they have been\r\ndestroying the subject races by systematic government action—a government\r\nemploying its resources in the murder of its own people. And this has\r\nbeen carried on with redoubled vigour and ruthlessness since the Turkish\r\nGovernment entered the War, and has been sure of Germany’s support in\r\ndefying the civilised world.\r\n\r\nThe Young Turks are “Nationalists” who have learnt in the German and\r\nMagyar school. Their national idea is to impose their own nationality\r\nby force on others. When the Young Turks came into power in 1908 they\r\nannounced a programme of “Ottomanisation.” Every language in the\r\nEmpire but Turkish was to be driven off the field; Turkish was to be\r\nthe sole language of government, and even of higher education. The\r\nnon-Turkish majority was to be assimilated to the Turkish minority by\r\ncoercion. The programme was copied from the “Prussianisation” of the\r\nPoles and “Magyarisation” of the Roumans, Slovaks and Southern Slavs in\r\nHungary whom the Allies declare their intention of liberating likewise\r\nfrom foreign domination in another clause of their Note. But in their\r\nNationalism, as in their Militarism, the Turks have gone to greater\r\nlengths than their European counterparts. The Prussians expropriate\r\nPolish landowners against the payment of a price for their land; the\r\nTurks drive forth Greeks and Bulgars destitute from their homes and\r\npossessions. The Magyars mobilise troops to terrorise Slovaks and Roumans\r\nat the elections; the Turks draft the criminals from their prisons into\r\nthe Gendarmerie to exterminate the Armenian race. From the beginning of\r\ntheir régime the Young Turks have pursued their nationalistic programme\r\nby butchery. The Adana massacres of 1909, the most terrible slaughter\r\nof Armenians between the Hamidian massacres of 1895-6 and those at\r\npresent in progress, occurred within a year of the proclamation of the\r\nYoung Turk Constitution, which assured equal rights of citizenship to\r\nall inhabitants of the Empire. In 1913 the Turkish Army was engaged in\r\nexterminating the Albanians because they had an un-Ottoman national\r\nspirit of their own. This work was interrupted by the Balkan War,\r\nbut the Turks revenged themselves for their defeat in this war,\r\nwhich liberated large Greek and Slav populations from their yoke, by\r\nexterminating all Greeks and Slavs left in the territory they still\r\nretained. They occupied themselves with this in the interval between the\r\nend of the Balkan and the beginning of the European War, and Greece was\r\non the verge of war with Turkey again to protect the dwindling remnant\r\nof the Greeks in Turkey’s power, when the crisis was overtaken by the\r\ngreater conflict. As soon as Turkey became Germany’s ally, Germany\r\nrestrained the Young Turks from persecuting their Greek subjects, because\r\nit was not to Germany’s interest that Greece should be involved in the\r\nwar on the side of the Entente. But she left them a free hand with their\r\nother subject peoples, and the result has been the _Armenian and Arab\r\natrocities_, which began in 1915 and have gone on ever since.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ARMENIAN ATROCITIES OF 1915.\r\n\r\nOnly a third of the two million Armenians in Turkey have survived, and\r\nthat at the price of apostatising to Islam or else of leaving all they\r\nhad and fleeing across the frontier. The refugees saw their women and\r\nchildren die by the roadside, and apostacy too, for a woman, involved\r\nthe living death of marriage to a Turk and inclusion in his harem. The\r\nother two-thirds were “deported”—that is, they were marched away from\r\ntheir homes in gangs, with no food or clothing for the journey, in fierce\r\nheat and bitter cold, hundreds of miles over rough mountain roads. They\r\nwere plundered and tormented by their guards, and by subsidised bands of\r\nbrigands, who descended on them in the wilderness, and with whom their\r\nguards fraternised. Parched with thirst, they were kept away from the\r\nwater with bayonets. They died of hunger and exposure and exhaustion,\r\nand in lonely places the guards and robbers fell upon them and murdered\r\nthem in batches—some at the first halting place after the start, others\r\nafter they had endured weeks of this agonising journey. About half the\r\ndeportees—and there was at least 1,200,000 of them in all—perished thus\r\non their journey, and the other half have been dying lingering deaths\r\never since at their journey’s end; for they have been deported to the\r\nmost inhospitable regions in the Ottoman Empire: the malarial marshes in\r\nthe Province of Konia; the banks of the Euphrates where, between Syria\r\nand Mesopotamia, it runs through a stony desert; the sultry and utterly\r\ndesolate track of the Hedjaz Railway. The exiles who are still alive have\r\nsuffered worse than those who perished by violence at the beginning.\r\n\r\nThe same campaign of extermination has been waged against the Nestorian\r\nChristians on the Persian frontier, and against the Arabs of Syria,\r\nChristians and Moslems without discrimination. In Syria there is a\r\nreign of terror. The Arab leaders have been imprisoned, executed, or\r\ndeported already, and the mass of the people lie paralysed, expecting\r\nthe Armenians’ fate and, dreading every moment to hear the decree of\r\nextermination go forth.\r\n\r\nThis wholesale destruction, which has already overtaken two of the\r\nsubject peoples in Turkey, and threatens all that 60 per cent. of the\r\npopulation which is not Turkish in language, is the direct work of the\r\nTurkish government. The “Deportation Scheme” was drawn up by the central\r\ngovernment at Constantinople and telegraphed simultaneously to all the\r\nlocal authorities in the Empire; it was executed by the officials,\r\nthe Gendarmerie, the Army, and the bands of brigands and criminals\r\norganised in the government’s service. No State could be more completely\r\nresponsible for any act within its borders than the Ottoman State is\r\nresponsible for the appalling crimes it has committed against its subject\r\npeoples during the War.\r\n\r\n\r\n“RADICALLY ALIEN TO WESTERN CIVILISATION.”\r\n\r\nThese crimes, and the phases of Ottoman History which lead up to them,\r\ndemonstrate, in the language of the Allies’ Note, that “_the Ottoman\r\nEmpire has proved itself radically alien to Western Civilisation_.” Where\r\nOttoman rule has spread, civilisation has perished. While Ottoman rule\r\nhas lasted, civilisation has remained in abeyance. It has only sprung\r\nup again when the oppressed peoples, at the cost of their own blood and\r\nby the aid of civilised nations more fortunate than themselves, have\r\nsucceeded in throwing off the Turkish yoke; and these struggles have\r\nbeen so much regained for liberty and progress in the world, because the\r\ninfliction of Turkish rule upon any other people has been an incalculable\r\nloss.\r\n\r\nTo this long history of horror the Allies are determined to put an end.\r\nThey will “_liberate the peoples who now lie beneath this murderous\r\ntyranny_.” But they proclaim no tyrannous intention against the Turks\r\nthemselves. In another clause of their note, they put it on record that\r\n“_it has never been their intention to seek the extermination or the\r\npolitical extinction of the Germanic peoples_.” The declaration holds\r\ngood, by implication, for the Magyar, Bulgar, and Turkish peoples who are\r\nthe Germanic peoples’ allies. There are regions in Asia Minor where the\r\nTurk is undisputed occupant of the land. The Allies have no intention of\r\n“deporting” or exterminating the Turk from these regions, as the Turk has\r\ndeported the Armenians from the regions that are theirs. The Turk, like\r\nthe German, Magyar and Bulgar, will remain where he belongs. Out of the\r\nbroad territory over which he at present domineers, he will be allowed\r\nto keep his just pound of flesh, but woe to him hereafter if he sheds one\r\ndrop of Christian blood....\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REORGANISATION OF EUROPE.\r\n\r\nThis settlement of Turkey is a logical element in the Allies’ general\r\naim in the War:—“_The reorganisation of Europe, guaranteed by a stable\r\nsettlement, based alike upon the principle of nationalities, on the right\r\nwhich all peoples, whether small or great, have to the enjoyment of\r\nfull security and free economic development, and also upon territorial\r\nagreements and international arrangements so framed as to guarantee land\r\nand sea frontiers against unjust attacks._”\r\n\r\nThis aim is no invention of yesterday; it has been the aspiration of all\r\nlovers of liberty for a century past.\r\n\r\n“_Let the Turks_,” said Mr. Gladstone in a famous speech, “_now carry\r\naway their abuses in the only possible manner, namely, by carrying\r\naway themselves. Their Zaptiehs and their Mudirs, their Bimbashis and\r\ntheir Yuzbashis, their Kaimakams and their Pashas, one and all, bag and\r\nbaggage, shall I hope clear out from the province they have desolated and\r\nprofaned._”\r\n\r\nThe province for which Mr. Gladstone pleaded was Bulgaria; but since\r\nBulgaria has been freed, the other peoples who have still remained under\r\nthe tyranny have suffered horrors infinitely worse in their extent and\r\ntheir iniquity than those which in 1876 aroused the indignation of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nHeinrich von Treitschke loved many things more than liberty, but the\r\nprofanation of liberty by the Turk drew from him a denunciation as\r\nstrong as Gladstone’s own. “_A near future_,” he writes, “_will, it is\r\nto be hoped, blot out the scandal that such heathendom should ever have\r\nestablished itself on European soil. What has this Turkish Empire done in\r\nthree entire centuries? It has done nothing but destroy._”\r\n\r\nTreitschke and Gladstone, men who stood for very different ideals in\r\nEurope, both called with one voice for liberation from the Turk; and the\r\nAllies are struggling now to bring what they strove for to completion.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCIPLE OF NATIONALITIES.\r\n\r\nIn the settlement of Turkey, conspicuously, the Allies will be crowning\r\na historic task, at which they themselves have laboured in former\r\ntimes. The _liberation of the subject peoples of Turkey_, and the\r\n_reorganisation upon the principle of nationalities_ of countries under\r\nthe Sultan’s _murderous tyranny_, began a century ago with the national\r\nstruggles for independence of the Serbs and Greeks—struggles which were\r\npart of the general struggle for freedom in Europe, and which gave\r\ninspiration to the people of other subject lands. England, France and\r\nRussia stepped in in 1827 to secure Greece the reward of her heroism when\r\nshe was almost succumbing to her oppressor; Russia compelled Turkey to\r\nrecognise Serbian autonomy in her treaty of peace with Turkey in 1831;\r\nRussia again, by taking up arms in 1877, freed Rumania and Serbia from\r\nTurkish suzerainty, liberated more of their oppressed brethren for Serbia\r\nand Greece, and restored Bulgaria to national existence. In the Balkan\r\nWar of 1912-13, the Balkan nations carried on the work by their unaided\r\nstrength, and expelled the Ottoman Empire from all the provinces over\r\nwhich it still tyrannised in Europe, with the exception of Constantinople\r\nand Thrace. In 1916, the Sherif of Mecca, at the opposite extremity of\r\nthe Ottoman conqueror’s domain, liberated an Arab province and the Holy\r\nArab City of which he is the legitimate head. It is for the Entente to\r\nliberate the Arabs of Syria and the Armenians, who cannot save themselves.\r\n\r\nThe Syrians and Armenians have not, as the Turks and Germans allege,\r\nbeen disloyal to Turkey in her hour of danger. The Arab and Armenian\r\nconscripts have fought dutifully for a cause not their own in the Balkan\r\nWar and in the present more terrible conflict. Their leaders are too\r\nprudent and the people too peaceable, their stake is too great, their\r\nforces are too scattered, to allow them for a moment to contemplate\r\nrising in arms. But their loyal and straightforward conduct has not\r\npreserved them from the ferocity of their Turkish rulers; it has only\r\nexposed them to a cold-blooded scheme of extermination which the\r\nYoung Turks are prosecuting at this moment with all their might. The\r\nredemption of these innocent peoples from the hell into which they have\r\nbeen cast, and where they will remain in agony so long as Ottoman and\r\nPrussian militarism holds out, is incumbent upon the Allies if they are\r\nto redeem their plighted word.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSTANTINOPLE.\r\n\r\nThis is what the Allies owe in the settlement of Turkey to the _principle\r\nof nationalities_. But they are further pledged to vindicate _the right\r\nwhich all peoples, whether small or great, have to the enjoyment of full\r\nsecurity and free economic development_, and this touches the status of\r\nConstantinople.\r\n\r\nConstantinople, since the Turks conquered it from its last Christian\r\nEmperor in 1453, has been the political capital of the Ottoman Empire.\r\nBut ever since it has been a city at all, it has also been the\r\nstrategical and economic key to the Black Sea, conditioning the security\r\nand dominating the economic development of all peoples bordering on the\r\nBlack Sea coasts. It is the most cosmopolitan city in the world. It is\r\nthe Turk’s at present by right of conquest, but that right justifies his\r\nexpulsion by war if it justifies his original intrusion, and on broader\r\nconsiderations of population, sentiments, traditions and monuments of\r\nthe past, Constantinople is more truly the capital of all the Christian\r\npeoples of the East. But it is not the exclusive possession of any of\r\nits native inhabitants, whether their presence there dates from more\r\nancient or from comparatively recent times. The most important quarter\r\nin Constantinople is Pera, across the Golden Horn, which is inhabited by\r\na foreign mercantile community, as international in its composition as\r\nthe mercantile community in the Chinese “Treaty Port” of Shanghai. The\r\nchief volume of the transit trade which gives Constantinople its rank\r\nas a port, passes through these foreign residents’ hands. But even they\r\nare not the parties most vitally concerned in the economic status of\r\nConstantinople and the Straits. If conditions do not suit them, they can\r\ntransfer their business elsewhere. The parties to whom the destiny of\r\nConstantinople is a matter of life and death are Russia and Rumania, two\r\ncountries bound for ever by their geographical position to conduct their\r\nmaritime trade through the Black Sea and the Straits that give entrance\r\nto it, and therefore at the mercy economically of any third power that\r\nholds the control of the Straits in its hands.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RIGHT TO FULL SECURITY.\r\n\r\nAnd this is not a theoretical question. It is a practical problem for\r\nthe national economy of Russia every year, and introduces a factor\r\nof uncertainty into Russia’s national trading which is profoundly\r\ndetrimental to her prosperity. As sovereign of the Straits, Turkey not\r\nonly possesses the technical right of closing the Straits to shipping;\r\nshe exercises it in an arbitrary fashion. Three times the Straits have\r\nbeen closed by Turkey within the last half-dozen years—during her war\r\nwith Italy, during the war with the Balkan States, and after the outbreak\r\nof the European war at a date previous to the intervention of Turkey\r\nherself in the struggle. It is possibly arguable that the closing was\r\nnecessary in each of these cases from a military point of view, to\r\nsafeguard Turkey’s political ownership of these “territorial waters.” But\r\nif so, that is in itself the strongest argument for taking out of the\r\nhands of an independent, irresponsible government a highway of commerce\r\nthe proper regulation of which is essential to the economic well-being\r\nof the Russian and Rumanian peoples. Even if Turkey were a friendly,\r\nsteady-going State, the situation would hardly be tolerable; but\r\nactually, whether through fault or misfortune, she has been at war more\r\noften during the last century than any other State in the world, and her\r\nhostility has been directed principally against Russia, the country most\r\nvitally affected by the disturbance of the traffic through the Straits.\r\nThe closing of the Straits in the last instance, when Russia was at war\r\nwith Germany and was in urgent need of the importation of supplies, can\r\nhardly be interpreted otherwise than as a hostile act—an anticipation\r\nof the open war which Turkey made on Russia within the next few weeks.\r\nTo leave this economic weapon in Turkey’s hands at the peace settlement\r\nwould be impossible. By closing the Straits in any given year at the\r\nprecise moment when the Russian harvest was shipped and ready to sail,\r\nand when the Russian importers had made their annual foreign purchases\r\non credit up to the full prospective value which the harvest would\r\nrealise in the markets of the world, Turkey could threaten Russia with a\r\nfinancial crisis verging on national bankruptcy. _Full security and free\r\neconomic development_ for Russia would have vanished beyond the horizon,\r\nand not only for Russia but for the whole world, for with such a trump\r\ncard in their hands, Turkey and her German patrons could never resist the\r\ntemptation of waging an economic “war after the war,” which might bring\r\nRussia to her knees and enable them to realise those ambitions against\r\nher which they have been unable to realise by force of arms.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO ALTERNATIVE.\r\n\r\nThat is why the control of the Straits, as well as the dominion\r\nover subject peoples, must be taken from the Ottoman Turks in the\r\n_reorganisation of Europe, guaranteed by a stable settlement_, which\r\nis the aim of the Allies. But neutrals, rightly anxious for a peace as\r\nspeedy as may be compatible with the attainment of the essential objects\r\nat stake, may ask whether either or both of the objects essential to\r\nthe settlement of the Turkish Empire are not attainable by less drastic\r\nmeasures than a redrawing of frontiers and a transference of territorial\r\nsovereignty. Cannot the liberation of the subject peoples be effected,\r\nwithout impairing Turkey’s territorial integrity, by some system of\r\ndevolution or local autonomy, under external guarantee and supervision?\r\nIs not this a field where the chief belligerents on either side, with\r\nthe addition of the United States, might work together in concert? The\r\nanswer is that this was precisely the solution attempted during the\r\n19th century, and that through the present war it has finally broken\r\ndown. During the 19th century the Concert of Europe did actually bring\r\nTurkey under a certain tutelage. The Ottoman tariff was regulated by\r\ntreaty; the customs and other branches of revenue were managed by an\r\nInternational Administration of the Ottoman Debt, representing Turkey’s\r\nbondholders. There were various experiments in local autonomy; Crete\r\nand the Lebanon enjoyed self-government under foreign guarantee; there\r\nwas an attempt to cure the anarchy deliberately fomented by the Turkish\r\ngovernment in Macedonia, by forcing the government to accept foreign\r\ngendarmerie-inspectors with definite spheres of supervision; there was a\r\npromise of reforms in the Armenian Vilayets, exacted from Turkey at the\r\nInternational Congress of Berlin, but never carried beyond the stage\r\nof paper schemes. It is unfortunately true that this joint European\r\ntutelage was illusory, that it failed to remove or even mitigate the\r\n_murderous tyranny_ that has always characterised Turkish government, and\r\nthat the Young Turks have used the opportunity of the War to repudiate\r\nit altogether. The British people have not lightly or inconsiderately\r\naccepted this conclusion—as they have, by implication, accepted it in\r\nframing this joint Note in conjunction with their Allies. They advance\r\nthese two aims with regard to the settlement of Turkey—_the liberation\r\nof the subject peoples_ and _the expulsion of Turkey from Europe_—in\r\nthe absolute conviction that they are necessary and right. But this\r\nconviction is in itself a very bitter confession of failure. It marks\r\nthe reversal of a policy pursued for a century past; for during the\r\nwhole of the 19th century Great Britain was the chief advocate of the\r\npolicy which aimed at the settlement of Turkey by the preservation of\r\nher territorial integrity subject to the active tutelage of the Concert\r\nof Europe. British diplomacy was constantly exerted on this behalf, and\r\nBritish belief in this policy was so sincere that half a century ago\r\nGreat Britain embarked in pursuit of it on a bloody war with one of her\r\npresent allies. If Great Britain is now a convinced adherent of the\r\nalternative and more drastic settlement, it is because the system of\r\njoint European control, after a century of experiment which perpetuated\r\nand aggravated the ancient tyranny, bloodshed and despair, has been made\r\nfinally impossible by the present War.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TURCO-GERMAN COMPACT.\r\n\r\nIt was to end it that the Young Turks entered the war on Germany’s side;\r\nfor foreign control automatically breaks down if one Great Power, and\r\nstill more if a group of two Powers, stands out of the Concert, renounces\r\nresponsibility for the policy of the Turkish government towards the\r\nsubject peoples and the economic highways which it holds in its power,\r\nand supports that government effectively in repudiating all claim to\r\nintervention on the part of the other Powers concerned. But this was the\r\nbargain struck between Germany and the Young Turks when Turkey attacked\r\nthe Allies, without provocation, in October, 1914. The Young Turks placed\r\nall their economic and military resources at Germany’s disposal. Turkish\r\ntroops (including of course the due percentage of conscripts from the\r\nsubject peoples), are fighting Germany’s battles on the Riga, Halicz and\r\nDobrudja fronts. The vast undeveloped economic resources of the Empire\r\nare, in the event of victory, to be thrown open to German exploitation\r\nwhen peace returns. These are concessions which Turkey has always\r\njealously refrained from making to any other Power; and the price Germany\r\nhas paid for them is the guarantee of just one thing—that the Young Turks\r\nshall have a free hand to repudiate all external control and to carry\r\nthrough their policy of “Ottomanisation” to a finish.\r\n\r\n\r\nA FREE HAND TO “OTTOMANISE.”\r\n\r\nThe Turks have not delayed in carrying out their side of the bargain,\r\nand they have been equally prompt in using the free hand assured them\r\nby Germany in return. First they repudiated the “Capitulations”—a\r\nsystem of treaties not particularly equitable in themselves, but still\r\ntreaties to which Turkey was pledged—by which the civil liberties of\r\nforeign residents in Turkey were guaranteed against the imperfections of\r\nTurkish judicial procedure. Then they repudiated the tariff treaties,\r\nand substituted for them a new tariff (recently published) of their\r\nown. Next they abrogated the Reform Scheme for the Armenian Vilayets,\r\nwhich the Concert of Europe had finally induced them to ratify, and\r\ndismissed the two Inspectors-General, a Dutchman and a Norwegian, whom\r\nthey had themselves commissioned to carry the scheme into effect. But\r\nthese breaches of contract were minor offences compared to the Armenian\r\nDeportations, the horror of which has been indicated briefly above, and\r\nwhich they did not venture to carry out until the Dardanelles Expedition\r\nhad failed. To complete the elimination of every non-Turkish element\r\nin the Empire, they are now trying to rid themselves of the American\r\nMissionaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE MISSIONARIES.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the Young Turks towards the Missionaries shows that\r\ntheir “Nationalism” has made them not only criminal but insane. The\r\nAmerican Missionaries have worked in Turkey for more than eighty years.\r\nTheir aim has been to revive religion in the subject Christian peoples\r\nand to give them an enlightened modern education; they have pursued\r\nthis aim disinterestedly with a striking measure of success, and they\r\nhave extended their work to the Moslems as far as the latter have\r\nresponded to their advances. They are the creators of practically all the\r\nsecondary education that exists in Turkey to-day. The most intelligent\r\nand progressive elements in the population of the Empire have come\r\nmost under their influence, and have received from them a moral and\r\nintellectual stimulus which they could never have found for themselves.\r\nThe educational work of the Missionaries should have been mentioned among\r\nthe attempts made during the 19th century to reform Turkey gradually\r\nby a reconstruction within; for the effect of this work was far more\r\npenetrating, and far more fraught with hope for the future, than most of\r\nthe political expedients instituted with diplomatic pomp and ceremony by\r\nthe Concert of the Powers. And the Missionaries were the best friends of\r\nthe Turkish government as well as of their subject peoples. They took no\r\npart in their pupils’ politics; they had no ulterior political purpose of\r\ntheir own to serve. They were the most valuable voluntary assistants the\r\nYoung Turks could have had in what should have been their foremost aims\r\nif they had acted up to their democratic professions, and they were the\r\nassistants whom they had least of all to fear.\r\n\r\nActually, however, the Young Turks, after they had destroyed the\r\nMissionaries’ work by exterminating the subject peoples among whom it\r\nwas principally carried on, dragging away to exile, shame and death the\r\nboys and girls in their schools, torturing to death the native professors\r\nwhom the Missionaries had trained up to be their colleagues, have\r\nfinally confiscated the American schools, colleges and mission-stations\r\nin many parts of the Empire, and have put the harshest pressure on\r\nthe Missionaries themselves to quit the country of which they are the\r\nbenefactors.\r\n\r\nOn April 4th, 1916, the Turkish newspaper _Hilal_ published an article in\r\npraise of a lecture by a member of the German Reichstag called Traub, in\r\nwhich the lecturer is reported to have declared himself “opposed to all\r\nmissionary activities in the Turkish Empire.”\r\n\r\n“The suppression,” writes _Hilal_, “of the schools founded and directed\r\nby ecclesiastical missions, a measure which follows the abolition of\r\nthe capitulary régime, was no less important. Thanks to their schools,\r\nforeigners were able to exercise great influence over the young men of\r\nthe country, and they were virtually in charge of the spiritual and\r\nintellectual guidance of our country. By closing them the Government has\r\nput an end to a situation as humiliating as it was dangerous....”\r\n\r\nThis is the policy of Ottomanisation. But it was put more bluntly by\r\na Turkish gendarme in conversation with a Danish Red Cross Sister,\r\nwho had been dismissed from her post in a hospital at Erzindjan for\r\nprotesting against the Armenian Deportations. “‘First,’ he said, ‘we kill\r\nthe Armenians, then the Greeks, then the Kurds,’ He would certainly,”\r\nthe Danish lady comments, “have been delighted to add: ‘And then the\r\nforeigners.’”[2]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TURCO-GERMAN ALLIANCE.\r\n\r\nIf they had not had the moral and military support of Germany, the\r\nYoung Turks would never have been able to wage this final campaign of\r\nextermination upon every element of good in the countries and the peoples\r\nthat are in their power. But it is not mere chance that the Turks and\r\nGermans have come together for these unholy ends.\r\n\r\nIn pursuing her ambition, Germany has found invaluable instruments in\r\nthe Hapsburg and Ottoman Empires. These States would be anachronisms in\r\na free democratic Europe, and were destined, if all went well with the\r\nworld’s development, to be transformed into willing federations or else\r\nto dissolve into their constituent peoples. But neither federalisation\r\nnor dissolution suited the interest of the tyrannous minority which has\r\nso far dominated and exploited each of these Empires for its own selfish\r\npurposes. In the Hapsburg Empire the tyrants are the corrupt Magyar\r\naristocracy, which dominates Hungary, and through Hungary the Empire as a\r\nwhole. In the Ottoman Empire they are the Young Turks, a secret society\r\nwith its central committee at Constantinople and branch committees in the\r\nprovinces, and with a gang of sordid adventurers as their puppets in the\r\nnominal headship of what professes to be a democratic government.\r\n\r\nThe Young Turks and the Magyar Oligarchy saw that the guarantee of\r\nPrussia, and that alone, could preserve their tyranny against the\r\nprogress of Democracy in Europe. The Prussians saw that the Turks and\r\nMagyars could sell them 70,000,000 human beings for “canonen futter,” in\r\naddition to the 70,000,000 Germans, Poles, Alsatians and Danes whom they\r\nalready possessed. This extra 70,000,000 seemed to put world dominion\r\nwithin their reach. The bargain was struck, and the War was made under\r\nwhich the whole world is suffering, and must still suffer for a season,\r\nif liberty is to be saved and the evil of centuries to be brought to a\r\ntardy end.\r\n\r\nThere is no possibility of returning to the _Status Quo_ before August\r\n1914—first, because the _Status Quo_ under the Turks was itself the mere\r\nperpetuation of an oppression and a misery that disgraced the civilised\r\nworld, and that should have been ended long before; and secondly, because\r\nit has been made unspeakably worse during the War than it was before it.\r\nEvery element of good that had maintained its existence under Turkish\r\ngovernment, and that made less intolerable a system that in itself\r\nwas too wicked to survive, is being stamped out now by deportation,\r\nspoliation, abduction and massacre. The evil has purged itself altogether\r\nof the good. Turkish tyranny has been stimulated by the German alliance\r\ninto an unnatural vitality, and the Central Confederates dream of putting\r\nthe clock in South-Eastern Europe a century back. Debauching one of the\r\nBalkan States by gorging her with spoil from the rest, they hope to stamp\r\nout liberty in the Balkans altogether, to reconquer for Militarism the\r\nfield which the 19th century won here for Democracy, and to build over it\r\na bridge by which three tyrant peoples, the Prussian, the Magyar and the\r\nTurk, shall join hands in dominating and destroying without interference\r\na multitude of smaller and weaker peoples from Alsace to Rumania and from\r\nSchleswig to Baghdad.\r\n\r\nIt is not a question of ameliorating the _Status Quo_. The _Status Quo_\r\nin Turkey, irremediable before, is being actively changed into something\r\ninfinitely worse, and this is being accomplished, behind the bulwark of\r\nMilitarism, under the eyes of the civilised world....\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ANSWER OF THE ALLIES.\r\n\r\nThis is why the Allies’ aims are drastic, but it is also why they _find\r\nno difficulty in stating them in the full light of day_. Germany, who\r\nhas not, like the Allies, met President Wilson’s request because she is\r\nashamed of her aims and dare not face the reception they would have among\r\nall the free democratic peoples of the civilised world, will doubtless\r\ntake what advantage she can of the Allies’ franker and more honourable\r\nrejoinder. In anticipation of such insidious manœuvres, the _Murderous\r\nTyranny of the Turks_, both during the War and for centuries before it,\r\nhas been set forth here for the judgment of the reader.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES.\r\n\r\n[1] The word “Turk” is here used as equivalent to “Turkish-speaking”;\r\nbut of course only a fraction of the present Turkish-speaking population\r\nin the Ottoman Empire is Turkish by descent.
