I might call myself “FLORESTAN II.” but\r\nI think it better taste for a dethroned prince, especially when he\r\nhappens to be a republican, to resume the name that is in reality his\r\nown.\r\n\r\nAlthough the events which I am about to relate occurred this winter, so\r\nlittle is known in England of the affairs of the Ex-principality of\r\nMonaco, now forming the French commune of that name, that I feel that the\r\ndetails of my story, indeed all but the bare facts on which it is\r\ngrounded, will be news to English readers.  The English Post Office\r\nbelieves that Monaco forms part of Italy, and the general election\r\nextinguished the telegrams that arrived from France in February last.\r\n\r\nAll who follow continental politics are aware that the Prince Charles\r\nHonoré, known as Charles III. of Monaco, and also called on account of\r\nhis infirmity “the blind prince,” was the ruling potentate of Monaco\r\nduring the last gambling season; that there lived with him his mother,\r\nthe dowager princess; that he was a widower with one son, Prince Albert,\r\nDuc de Valentinois, heir apparent to the throne; that the latter had by\r\nhis marriage with the Princess Marie of Hamilton, sister to the Duke of\r\nHamilton, one son who in 1873 was six years old; that all the family\r\nlived on M. Blanc the lessee of the gambling tables.  But Monaco is shut\r\noff from the rest of the world except in the winter months, and few have\r\nheard of the calamities which since the end of January have rained upon\r\nthe ruling family.  My cousin, Prince Albert, the “Sailor Prince,” a good\r\nfellow of my own age, with no fault but his rash love of uselessly\r\nbraving the perils of the ocean, had often been warned of the fate that\r\nwould one day befall him.  Once when a boy he had put to sea in his boat\r\nwhen a fearful storm was raging, had been upset just off the point at\r\nMonaco, and had been saved only by the gallantry of a sailor of the port\r\nwho had risked his own life in keeping his sovereign’s son afloat.  In\r\nOctober 1873 my unfortunate cousin bought at Plymouth an English sailing\r\nyacht of 450 tons.  He had a sailor’s contempt for steam, which he told\r\nme was only fit for lubbers, when he came up and stayed with me at\r\nCambridge in November to see the “fours.”  He explained to me then that\r\nhe had got a bargain, that he had bought his yacht for one-third her\r\nvalue, and that he was picking up a capital crew of thirty men.  He had\r\nno need to buy yachts for a third their value, for he was rich enough and\r\nto spare, having enjoyed the large fortune of his mother from the time he\r\ncame of age.  She was a Mérode, and vast forests in Belgium—part of\r\nSoignies for instance—belonged to him.  His wife had her own fortune of\r\nfour and a half million francs, bringing her in about seven thousand\r\npounds a year, so he was able to spend all his money on himself.  He did\r\nnot spend it on his dress, for when he came to Cambridge and was\r\nintroduced to Dr. Thompson, he neither had a dress suit to dine in at the\r\nlodge, nor a black morning coat to put on for hall, where his rough\r\npea-jacket scandalised the “scouts.”  He sailed from Plymouth in\r\nNovember, and reached Monaco at the end of that month.  In December he\r\nmade several excursions, in none of which did his father go to sea with\r\nhim, but on the 26th of January, as ill luck would have it, he tempted my\r\npoor uncle to go with him for a three days’ cruise.  It came on to blow\r\nhard that night, and nothing was ever heard of them again.  Great was the\r\nexcitement at Monaco on the 27th and 28th, but on the 29th the worst was\r\nknown, as a telegram from Genoa informed the unfortunate old princess—who\r\nhas all her faculties at the age of eighty-six—that her son and grandson\r\nwere both numbered with the dead, for one of the boats of the rotten\r\nyacht had been fallen in with by a fishing vessel floating empty in mid\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nThe Conseil d’Etat was at once called together by the Governor General,\r\nand the little boy of the Princess Marie proclaimed by their order at the\r\nmarket-place.  A proclamation was posted in the town the moment the\r\nsitting ended, declaring the joint regency of the dowager princess and of\r\nBaron Imberty.  A telegram was sent to Princess Marie, who was staying\r\nwith her child at Nice, informing her of her husband’s death and of the\r\naccession of her son, and begging that she would the next day confide the\r\nlittle Duc de Valentinois to the deputation of the councillors of state\r\nand of the officers of guards, who would reach Nice by train at noon.\r\nShe was in the same despatch assured that on the death of the old dowager\r\nprincess she should succeed her in the regency, but for family reasons on\r\nwhich I need not enlarge, she was requested not on this occasion to\r\naccompany her son.\r\n\r\nAll this I learnt by a telegram from the baron; I, as the son of the\r\nsister of the late prince, having now become most unexpectedly next heir\r\nto the throne of Monaco.  I had no idea of the possibility of my ever\r\nbeing called upon to succeed a healthy boy of six, and gave the matter no\r\nthought but one of regret at the death of my gallant cousin Albert, who\r\nin the Prussian war had proved his courage in the French navy, while I,\r\nhad I been older, should have had to have fought upon the other side, my\r\nfather having been a prince of Wurtemberg.\r\n\r\nI was thoroughly English in my ways.  My father, a man of wide and\r\nliberal views, disliking “professors” as much as Mr. Disraeli does, and\r\nespecially distrusting Prussian pedagogues, had sent me to Eton and to\r\nTrinity. At Eton I had lived rather with the King’s scholars than with my\r\nmore natural allies, and had imbibed some views at which my poor father\r\nwould have groaned.  When I went up to Cambridge my friendships were in\r\nKing’s rather than in Third Trinity, and my opinions were those now\r\npopular among spectacled undergraduates, namely, universal negation.  I\r\neven joined First Trinity Boat Club, instead of Third, because the\r\ngentlemen of the latter were too exclusive for my princely tastes.\r\n\r\nDuring my four years at Cambridge I had rowed in First Trinity Second.  I\r\nhad heard at the Union Mr. Seeley defend the Commune, and oppose a motion\r\ndeclaring it innocent because it did not go on to express the “love and\r\naffection” with which that body was regarded by the University.  I had\r\nsupported a young fellow of Trinity when he showed that the surplus funds\r\nof the Union Society should be applied to the erection of statues of\r\nMazzini in all the small villages of the West of England—a motion which I\r\nbelieve was carried, but neutralized by the fact that the Union Society\r\npossessed no surplus funds.  I had also had the inestimable advantage of\r\nattending the lectures of Professor Fawcett on the English poor laws.  I\r\nhad, by the way, almost forgotten the most amusing of all the Union\r\nepisodes of my time, which was the rising of Mr. Dilke of Trinity Hall,\r\nSir Charles Dilke’s brother—but a man of more real talent than his\r\nbrother, although, if possible, a still more lugubrious speaker—to move\r\nthat his brother’s portrait, together with that of Lord Edmond\r\nFitzmaurice, the communist brother of a Marquis and a congenial spirit,\r\nshould be suspended in the committee room to watch over the deliberations\r\nof that body, because, forsooth, they had happened to be president and\r\nvice-president of the Society at a moment when the new buildings were\r\nbegun out of the subscriptions of such very different politicians as the\r\nPrince of Wales, the Duke of Devonshire, and Lord Powis.  Mr. Dilke and\r\nhis radicals were sometimes in a majority and sometimes in a minority at\r\nthe Union, and the portraits of the republican lord and baronet went up\r\non the wall or down under the table accordingly, Mr. Willimott, the\r\nvalued custodian of the rooms, carrying out the orders of both sides with\r\nabsolute impartiality.\r\n\r\nFired with the enthusiasm of my party and of my age, I had subscribed to\r\nthe Woman’s Suffrage Association, to Mr. Bradlaugh’s election expenses,\r\nto the Anti-Game-Law Association, and to the Education League.  My\r\nreading was less one-sided than my politics, and my republicanism was\r\ntempered by an unwavering worship of “Lothair.”  Mr. Disraeli was my\r\nadmiration as a public man—a Bismarck without his physique and his\r\nopportunities—but then in politics one always personally prefers one’s\r\nopponents to one’s friends.  As a republican, I had a cordial aversion\r\nfor Sir Charles Dilke, a clever writer, but an awfully dull speaker, who\r\nimagines that his forte is public speaking, and who, having been brought\r\nup in a set of strong prejudices, positively makes a merit to himself of\r\nnever having got over them.  This he calls “never changing his opinions.”\r\nFor Mr. Gladstone I had the ordinary undergraduate detestation.  There\r\nare no liberals at Cambridge.  We were all rank republicans or champions\r\nof right divine.\r\n\r\nThe 31st of January was a strange day in my history.  On entering my\r\nrooms in my flannels, hot from the boats, and hurrying for hall, I saw a\r\ntelegram upon the table.  I tore it open.\r\n\r\n                      “_The Governor-General_, _Monaco_;\r\n                                     _to_\r\n                   _His Serene Highness Prince Florestan_,\r\n\r\n                                                        _Trinity College_,\r\n                                                             _Cambridge_.”\r\n\r\n“His Serene Highness!”  Surely a mistake!  I read on.\r\n\r\n    “This morning at noon his Serene Highness the reigning prince was\r\n    committed by the princess his mother to the care of M. Henri de\r\n    Payan, at Nice.  The princess being nervous about railway accidents,\r\n    the departure for Monaco took place by road.  The carriage conveying\r\n    his Serene Highness and M. de Payan was drawn by four horses.  Turbie\r\n    was reached without mishap, but half-way between Turbie and\r\n    Roquebrune, at a sharp turn in the road, the horses took fright, and\r\n    the coachman, in avoiding the precipice, threw the carriage upon the\r\n    rocks on the mountain side of the road.  His Serene Highness was\r\n    thrown on his head and killed on the spot.  Your Serene Highness is\r\n    now reigning prince of Monaco, and will be proclaimed to-night after\r\n    the meeting of the Council of State by the style of Florestan II.\r\n    Lieutenant Gasignol, of the guard, will proceed at once to England\r\n    and meet your Serene Highness at any spot which your Highness may\r\n    please to indicate.  M. de Payan escaped without a scratch.”\r\n\r\nPrince of Monaco!  Prince of Monaco.  And I had seen Lafont in _Rabagas_!\r\nI was not a “milk-and-water Rabagas,” as Mr. Cole called Mr. Lowe, when\r\nall the papers reported him to have said “milk-and-water Rabelais,” and\r\nthe _Spectator_ mildly wondered at the strangeness of the comparison.\r\nNo, but I was somewhat of a milk-and-water Prince of Monaco after Lafont.\r\nWhat distinction!  What carriage!  If the princes of the earth were only\r\nlike the princes of the stage, there would be no republicans.  But then,\r\nfortunately, they are not.  “Fortunately!” and I one of them.  What am I\r\nsaying?\r\n\r\nPoor little fellow!  How sad for his young mother too.  A reigning prince\r\nfor nineteen hours, and that outside of his own dominions and at the age\r\nof six.  A strange world! and a strange world, for me too.  A\r\nhalf-Protestant, half-free-thinking, republican, German, Cambridge\r\nundergraduate, suddenly called to rule despotically over a Catholic and\r\nItalian people.  My succession, at least, would be undisputed.  No one\r\nhad ever vowed that I “should never ascend the throne—without a protest.”\r\nOne of the Grimaldis had a claim which was no doubt a just one, my\r\nrespected great uncle having been probably a usurper; but Marshal\r\nMacMahon and the Duc de Broglie would, I well knew, support me,\r\npreferring even a German prince at Monaco to an Italian.  My succession,\r\nI repeat, was undisputed; but if anybody had taken the trouble to dispute\r\nit, I can answer for it that they would have been cheated out of their\r\namusement, for I should willingly have resigned to their charge so\r\nburdensome a toy.  I was that which the republican mayor of Birmingham,\r\nMr. Joseph Chamberlain, in his jocular speech proposing the Prince of\r\nWales’ health at the mayor’s banquet, said that one of his friends had\r\nbeen trying by argument to make the Prince—with, “as yet,” only “partial\r\nsuccess”—a republican King.  I would have gone only to Monaco to proclaim\r\nthe republic had I not known that the strange despotism—presided over not\r\nas a despotism should be by one clever despot, but by two stupid despots,\r\nthe Dukes of Magenta and Broglie—which is called the French republic,\r\nwould not permit the creation of a small model for herself in the middle\r\nof her commune of Roquebrune.\r\n\r\nI was not sorry to leave Cambridge.  My rooms in the new court overlooked\r\nCaius, where they had typhoid fever; and between the fear of infection\r\nand the noise of the freshmen’s wines in Trinity Hall, I was beginning to\r\nhave enough of Cambridge.  My bedmaker and tutor were the only people to\r\nwhom I bid goodbye.  The men were all in hall and out at wines, and I\r\nleft notes for my friends instead of looking them up in their rooms.  I\r\ncaught my tutor as he was going into hall.  I told him of the news, and I\r\ncould see the idea of an invitation for next winter to the castle at\r\nMonaco pass through his mind as he assured me that my rule would be a\r\nblessing to my country, and that nothing could better fit me for a\r\nsceptre than the training of an English gentleman.  He added, with a\r\nreturn of the grim humour of a don, that he supposed that as a sovereign\r\nprince I need scarcely “take an _exeat_.”  My poor old bed-maker, who had\r\nread the telegram in my absence from my room, called me “your imperial\r\nmajesty” three times while she packed my shirts, but in half-an-hour I\r\nwas off to London; and on the evening of the 3rd of February I met M. de\r\nPayan and Lieutenant Gasignol by appointment at the Grand Hotel at Paris.\r\n\r\nFrom M. de Payan I obtained my first accurate ideas as to the State of\r\nMonaco.  I found that I was not more independent under the supremacy of\r\nFrance than is the Emperor William independent under the domination of\r\nPrince von Bismarck.  I had not only the Code Napoléon, and a Council of\r\nState dressed in exact copies of their Versailles namesakes, but French\r\ncustom-house officers levying French custom-house duties in my dominions.\r\nAt the beginning of our conversation I had said to M. de Payan, “Between\r\nourselves, and fearing though I do that like Charles I. of England I may\r\nbe committing high treason against myself, I feel bound to tell you that\r\nmy only ideas of my principality are derived from M. Sardou’s _Rabagas_.”\r\n\r\nWhy is it that inhabitants of small and isolated communities never can\r\nsee a joke?  M. de Payan, slightly drawing himself up and speaking with\r\nas much stiffness as he could assume towards his prince, gravely answered\r\nme, “Your Serene Highness is not aware, I presume, that _Rabagas_ was a\r\nsatire directed against France in her decline, and not against your\r\nHighness’s principality.”\r\n\r\nM. Sardou wasting his hours on satirising Monaco.  I will never joke\r\nagain, I said to myself, unless I should suffer the modern fate of kings\r\nand be deposed.\r\n\r\n“M. de Payan,” I replied, “I am aware of what you say, and I was joking.”\r\n\r\n“We have no Gambettas at Monaco, your Highness; that is all I meant.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps, Sir, the country would be happier if you had.  Rabagas was not\r\nGambetta, but Emile Olivier—not the man who never despaired of France,\r\nbut the man who sacrificed his opinions to his advancement.  I admire M.\r\nGambetta, who is at this moment the first man in France, in my\r\nestimation, and the second political man in Europe.  His figure will\r\nstand out in history, daubed as even it is with the mud that French\r\npoliticians are ceaselessly flinging at each other.”\r\n\r\n“M. Gambetta is, as your Serene Highness says, a man of extraordinary\r\npowers; but his father was a tradesman at Cahors, and is retired and\r\nlives at Nice, near your Serene Highness’s dominions.”\r\n\r\nWhat more could I say?  There was nothing to be made of M. de Payan.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of February I reached Nice by the express, and after reading\r\nthe telegram which announced the return of Mr. Gladstone by a discerning\r\npeople as junior colleague to a gin distiller, was presented with an\r\naddress by the Gambettist mayor at the desire of the legitimist préfêt.\r\nThe mayor, being a red-hot republican in politics but a carriage-builder\r\nby trade, lectured me on the drawbacks of despotism in his address, but\r\ninformed me in conversation afterwards that he had had the honour of\r\nbuilding a Victoria for Prince Charles Honoré—which was next door to\r\ngiving me his business card.  The address, however, also assumed that the\r\nPrinces of Monaco were suffered only by Providence to exist in order that\r\nthe trade of Nice, the nearest large French town, might thrive.\r\n\r\nIn the evening at four we reached the station at Monaco, which was decked\r\nwith the white flags of my ancestors.  What a pity, was my thought, that\r\nM. de Chambord should not be aware that if he would come to stay with me\r\nat the castle he would live under the white flag to which he is so much\r\nattached all the days of his life.  My reception was enthusiastic.  The\r\nguards, in blue uniforms not unlike the Bavarian, but with tall shakoes\r\ninstead of helmets, and similar to that which during the stoppage of the\r\ntrain at Nice I had rapidly put on, were drawn up in line to the number\r\nof thirty-nine—one being in hospital with a wart on his thumb, as M. de\r\nPayan told me.  What an admirable centralisation that such a detail\r\nshould be known to every member of the administration!  Two drummers\r\nrolled their drums French fashion.  In front of the line were four\r\nofficers, of whom—one fat; Baron Imberty; the Vicar General; and Père\r\nPellico of the Jesuits of the Visitation, brother as I already knew to\r\nthe celebrated Italian patriot, Silvio Pellico, of dungeon and spider\r\nfame.\r\n\r\n“Where is M. Blanc?” I cried to M. de Payan, as we stopped, seeing no one\r\nnot in uniform or robes.\r\n\r\n“M. Blanc,” said M. de Payan, severely, “though a useful subject of your\r\nHighness is neither a member of the household of your Highness, a soldier\r\nof His army, nor a functionary of His government.  M. Blanc is in the\r\ncrowd outside.”\r\n\r\nHad I ventured to talk slang to M. de Payan, of whom I already stood in\r\nawe, I should have replied, “Elle est _salée_, celle là; puisque sans M.\r\nBlanc mon pays ne marcherait pas.”  But I held my tongue.\r\n\r\nI have seen many amusing sights in the course of my short life.  I have\r\nseen an Anglican clergyman dance the cancan—I have seen Lord Claud\r\nHamilton, the elder, address the English House of Commons—I have watched\r\nwith breathless interest the gesticulations of French orators in the\r\ntribune of the Assembly, when not a word could reach my ears through the\r\ndin of Babel that their colleagues made.  But the oddest sight I ever saw\r\nwas the bow with which Colonel Jacquemet, conscious even at the glorious\r\nmoment that history would not forget his name, assured me that “the\r\ndevoted army of a Gallant and a Glorious Prince would follow him to the\r\ndeath, when Honour led and Duty called.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment Père Pellico slipped round to my side and said, “A word\r\nwith your Highness.  A most unfortunate report has got abroad that your\r\nHighness is a heretic.  What is to be done?”\r\n\r\n“I very much fear I am,” I replied.\r\n\r\n“But surely your Highness has never formally joined a Protestant body?”\r\n\r\n“Protestant?  Oh, no.  I am a freethinker; a follower of Strauss rather\r\nthan of Dr. Cumming.”\r\n\r\n“How your Highness has relieved my mind!  Only a freethinker—but that is\r\nnothing.  I feared that possibly your Highness might have suffered a\r\nperversion to some of the many schisms.”  He bowed and hurried off into\r\nthe town, while taking the arm of Baron Imberty I said, “Introduce me to\r\nM. Blanc.”\r\n\r\n“Your Highness wishes that M. Blanc should be presented to your Highness,\r\nbut there are three hundred and ten or three hundred and twenty gentlemen\r\nwho take precedence of M. Blanc.  Nevertheless, your Highness has only to\r\ncommand.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, touch my arm as we pass him in the crowd, and I will speak\r\nto him informally.”\r\n\r\nMy ideas of etiquette would have horrified Madame von Biegeleben, the\r\nlady-in-waiting to my poor mother; still, I was improving already, as may\r\nbe seen.\r\n\r\nAs we left the station building a little man in black, who when he is\r\ntwenty years older will be as like M. Thiers in person as he already is\r\nin tact, in power of talk, and in the combination of a total absence of\r\nfixed opinions with a decided manner, made a low bow, accompanied with\r\nthe shrewdest smile that I had seen.\r\n\r\n“That,” I said, halting before him, “is M. Blanc.  I am glad to have so\r\nearly an opportunity of commencing an acquaintance, which I hope to\r\nimprove.”\r\n\r\n“Your Serene Highness does me too much honour.”\r\n\r\nThus I passed the man who played Haussmann to my Emperor, but who had the\r\nadditional advantage which the costly baron of demolishing memory\r\ncertainly did not possess, of being a magnificent source of revenue to my\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nMounting the really fine horse that they had sent me down, and escorted\r\nby the sixteen mounted carbineers (who do police duty on foot in ordinary\r\ntimes at Monte Carlo and in the town), I rode off at a sharp trot by the\r\nwinding road.\r\n\r\n“Will your Serene Highness graciously please to go at a walk, for\r\notherwise the guards will not have time to get up by the military road\r\nand to form again to receive your Highness at the _Place_.”\r\n\r\nI did as I was bid, of course.  Bouquets of violets were showered on me\r\nas we passed through the narrow street, and the scene on the public\r\nsquare in front of the castle was really fine.  The sun was setting in\r\nglory over the Mediterranean in the west; on the north the Alpes\r\nMonégasques were beginning to take the deep red glow which nightly in\r\nthat glorious climate they assume.  On the east the palms at Monte Carlo\r\nstood out sharply against the deep still blue sky, and in the far\r\ndistance the great waves of the ground swell were rolling in upon the\r\ncoast towards Mentone and the Italian frontier, with thousands of bright\r\nwhite sea-gulls speckling the watery hills with dots of light.  At the\r\npalace gate I was received by the old dowager princess.  She bent and\r\nkissed my hand.  I threw my arms round her neck and kissed her on both\r\ncheeks.\r\n\r\n“That was kindly meant, Highness,” she said, “but your Serene Highness is\r\nnow the reigning prince, and in the presence of the mob your dignity must\r\nbe kept up.”\r\n\r\nPassing the two great Suisses who, arrayed in gala costume, stood\r\nmagnificently at the gate—but whose wages I afterwards discovered were\r\nsupplemented by showing my bedroom when I was out to English tourists at\r\na franc a head—we entered the grand courtyard, ascended the great stairs,\r\nand passed straight into the reception hall known as the Salle Grimaldi.\r\nThere, standing on a dais, opposite to the magnificent fireplace and\r\nchimney-piece, with the baron at my side, I held a levee, and received\r\nthe vicar-general, père de Don; the curé of the cathedral, l’abbé Ramin;\r\nthe chevalier de Castellat, vice-president of the council of state; the\r\nchevalier Voliver, member of council of state, and president of the\r\ncouncil of public education; the Marquis de Bausset-Roquefort, president\r\nof the high court of justice and member of the council of state; the\r\ntreasurer-general, M. Lombard; Monsignore Theuret, the first almoner of\r\nthe household; Monsignore Ciccodicola, the honorary almoner; Colonel the\r\nVicomte de Grandsaigne, my first aide-de-camp; Major Pouget d’Aigrevaux,\r\ncommandant of the palace; the two attachés of M. de Payan in his office\r\nof secretary-general, MM. Stephen Gastaldi and John Blanchi; my doctor,\r\nM. Coulon, a leading member of the council of education, and evidently a\r\nmost intelligent man; the curés of the six smaller churches; the five\r\nprofessors of the Jesuit college of La Visitation; three aides-de-camp;\r\nthe chef du cabinet; the chamberlain himself, who had introduced the\r\nothers; and four officers of guards and one of carbineers, in addition to\r\nColonel Jacquemet, whom I have already named.  No conversation took\r\nplace, and the presentations being over in five minutes, I got out in the\r\ngarden before dark for a quiet stroll by myself before dinner.\r\n\r\nI was struck by the scene.  The tall palms, the giant tree geraniums\r\nblooming in masses down the great cliffs to the very edge of the dark\r\nblue sea, the feathery mimosas, the graceful pepper trees laden with\r\ncrimson berries, the orange grove, the bananas fruiting and flowering at\r\nthe same time, the passion flowers climbing against the rugged old castle\r\nwalls, all were new to me—unused to the south, and brought up in\r\nBuckinghamshire, in Cambridgeshire, and in central Germany.  The scene\r\nsaddened me, I know not why, and I asked myself whether, with the odd\r\ncombination of my opinions and my position, I could be of any use in the\r\nworld except to bring Monarchy into contempt.  Here was I, a freethinker,\r\ncalled upon to rule a people of bigoted Catholics through a Jesuit\r\nfather—for I had already seen that Père Pellico was the real vice-king.\r\nHere was I, an ardent partisan of the doctrine of individuality, placed\r\nsuddenly at the head of the most centralized administration in the world.\r\nWhat was to be done?  Reform it?  Yes, but no reformer has so ill a time\r\nof it as a reforming prince.  Sadly I went in to a sad dinner\r\n_tête-à-tête_ with my crape-covered great aunt in a gloomy room, and so\r\nto bed, convinced that unhappiness may co-exist with the possession of a\r\nhall porter as big as Mrs. Bischoffsheim’s.\r\n\r\nThe next morning when I dreamily called for my coffee there was brought\r\nto me along with it a gigantic envelope sealed with soft wax stamped with\r\nmy arms, and containing a terrific despatch of twenty-three pages.\r\n“Rapport Hebdomadaire.”  “Weekly report” of what, I asked myself.  Why, I\r\nhave but five thousand subjects—the same number that Octavia Hill rules\r\nin Marylebone with such success.  I began to read.\r\n\r\n    “On Monday night a man named Marsan called the carbineer Fissori a\r\n    fool.  He was not arrested (see Order No. 1142 and correspondence 70,\r\n    10, 102), but a private report was addressed to the Council of State,\r\n    on which the Secretary General decided to recommend that Marsan\r\n    should be watched for a week; referred to the Sub-Committee on Public\r\n    Order.”\r\n\r\n    “M. Blanc on Tuesday visited the tunnel in the commune of Turbie\r\n    (France) by which he hopes to obtain an additional water supply for\r\n    the Casino.  As M. Blanc had not had the courtesy to inform the\r\n    secretarial office of his excursion it was impossible to send an\r\n    agent to obtain details of what took place.”\r\n\r\nSo on for twenty and more pages, the last informing me of the names of\r\nthe fishing boats that had come in and gone out, of the time of sunrise,\r\nand of the fact that a private in my guards had caught a cold in his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nIt was unbearable.  These formalities should be suppressed at once.  The\r\nadministration should be decentralised.  I rang and sent to the\r\nsecretarial office for M. de Payan.  I addressed him thus:—\r\n\r\n“I gather from this tedious document that my principality of five\r\nthousand persons possesses every appliance and every excrescence of\r\ncivilized government except a parliament.  The perfection of bureaucracy\r\nand of red tape has been reached in a territory one mile broad and five\r\nmiles long.  No doubt centralisation is less hurtful than it is elsewhere\r\nin a country so small that it is virtually all centre, but I intend that\r\nthis state of things (for which you are in no way responsible) shall\r\ncease.  In the first place kindly inform me of the facts.  What are the\r\nexpenses and what are the revenues of the state, and what is the number\r\nof its officials?”\r\n\r\n“There are, Sir,” he answered, “including your household and the officers\r\nof your guards, one hundred and twenty-six functionaries in Monaco.\r\nThere are sixty soldiers and carbineers, and there are one hundred and\r\nfifty unpaid consular and diplomatic representatives of Monaco abroad.”\r\n\r\n“How many servants have I in all, including stable men?”\r\n\r\n“Twenty-five.”\r\n\r\n“Then you mean to say that there are three hundred and sixty-one persons\r\nemployed under the crown for a population of thirteen hundred male\r\ninhabitants of full age?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Sir, and M. Blanc employs on his works and at the Casino eight\r\nhundred of the remainder.”\r\n\r\nThis was a startling state of things, but I soon found out that, as\r\nColonel Jacquemet had used his men twice over on my arrival, so we used\r\nour politicians twice or thrice, politicians being happily scarce with\r\nus.  Many posts were filled by one man, a plan which has its advantages\r\nas well as its drawbacks, the advantages predominating in a country where\r\nthere are eleven hundred and sixty posts to fill and only thirteen\r\nhundred grown male inhabitants.\r\n\r\nTo give you an idea of the way in which we used our men, Baron Imberty,\r\nour Governor-General for instance, was also President of the Council of\r\nState, Chancellor of the Order of St. Charles, President of the Maritime\r\nCouncil, President of the Board of Public Works, President of the Bureau\r\nde Bienfaisance, etc. etc.\r\n\r\nThanks to M. Blanc and his gambling establishment, and thanks to the\r\nlarge private fortune of my family, the finances of Monaco were in a\r\nflourishing position.  Prince Charles had had half a million of francs a\r\nyear of private fortune and of revenue from the gambling tables.  My\r\ncousin Albert had had three hundred thousand francs a year.  I\r\nconsequently had eight hundred thousand francs of private fortune, or\r\n£32,000 a year, out of which I could easily keep up the palace, the\r\nstables, and, if I chose, a powerful steam yacht, together with my\r\ncousin’s house in Belgium as a summer residence.  The cost of the\r\ngovernment for army, church, education, and justice, was two hundred\r\nthousand francs a year.  Public works were dealt with liberally by M.\r\nBlanc as a part of his “concession.”  The ordinary revenue was derived\r\nfrom four sources, each contributing about an equal share.  These were:—\r\n\r\n  I.  The payment of the Government of France for half the value of the\r\n  tobacco sold in the principality on behalf of the French _régie_.\r\n\r\n  II. The payment of France for customs collected by France in my ports.\r\n\r\n  III. The payment by the “Paris, Lyons, Méditerranée” Railway for right\r\n  of passage.\r\n\r\n  IV. Our only local tax, one on all lands and houses changing hands.\r\n\r\nThe total receipts were two hundred thousand francs, or about the same as\r\nthe total expense of government.\r\n\r\nI dismissed M. de Payan; and without telling anyone where I was going I\r\nwalked up to the Casino by myself.\r\n\r\nI was little known by sight at present in the town, as those who had seen\r\nme enter it in uniform and on horseback the day before would hardly\r\nrecognize me in deep mourning and on foot.  I passed unnoticed by the\r\nguards, and on reaching the Casino, hot and dusty, was stopped by one of\r\nthe employés of the bank, I said, “Take me to M. Blanc.”\r\n\r\nUnder similar circumstances the Prince of Wales is introduced as “Captain\r\nWhite,” but then he is not a _sovereign_ prince; and I preferred to give\r\nno name at all than to assume an alias.\r\n\r\nI found him literally “a counting out his money.”  That is to say, two\r\nclerks were counting rouleaus of gold while he at a small table was\r\nquietly playing patience with two packs of cards.  At a bureau was a\r\nthird clerk, an Englishman, translating into French for his benefit one\r\nof Mr. Bagehot’s leaders in the _Economist_.\r\n\r\nHe knew me at once, although he had seen me but for a moment and in a\r\nwholly different dress.  Bowing low, and speaking not to me but to his\r\nclerks, he said, “Qu’on nous laisse.”  The moment they had left the room\r\nhe bowed to the ground again, and said, “Ah monseigneur, votre\r\nseigneurerie me fait trop d’honneur!  J’allais écrire à monsieur le\r\nchambellan pour lui demander de vouloir bien solliciter une audience en\r\nmon nom, afin de déposer mes respectueux hommages aux pieds de votre\r\nAltesse.  Elle me comble en venant chez moi incognito.”\r\n\r\nM. Blanc, whose appearance I described before, is well known to gambling\r\nEurope as a distinguished political economist, the keeper of the greatest\r\n“hell” on earth, and the loving father of a pair of pretty and\r\naccomplished daughters, living upon roulette, but himself innocent\r\nnowadays of all games but the mildest patience—of which he knows sixty\r\nkinds.  At Monaco he is more than a public character: he is a benefactor\r\nand a prince.  Attacks may be made upon gambling establishments even\r\nconducted as his is, but I am disposed to agree with the Jesuit fathers\r\nof the Visitation that the Monaco roulette—forbidden to the inhabitants\r\nof Monaco and of the neighbouring parts of France—does not do much harm\r\nto anyone, although I could hardly go with Père Pellico so far as to\r\nprohibit the building of a Protestant church while he tolerates a “hell,”\r\nand even permits his students to visit the musical portion of its rooms.\r\nI had no wish in my proposed reforms to reform out of existence my\r\nroulette revenue.  I wished indeed to make good use of it; better use\r\nthan my predecessors had done.  I wanted to make of Monaco a Munich and a\r\nDresden all in one.  I would have a gallery of the greatest modern\r\npictures—great ancient ones are not now to be obtained—a magnificent\r\norchestra, a theatre of the first rank; art, in short, of all kind of the\r\nhighest class by which to raise the culture of my people, who, excluded\r\nfrom the gambling side of the Casino by a wise ordinance of my\r\npredecessor, would reap the benefit without drinking the poison of the\r\nroulette.\r\n\r\nI found M. Blanc’s mind running upon the question of whether English\r\nfamilies would be most attracted to Monaco by pigeon-shooting or by an\r\nEnglish church.  The church he fancied most, but owing to the opposition\r\nof Père Pellico it would have to be built upon the hill a mile off from\r\nthe Casino, in the territory of France.\r\n\r\n“I will authorise you to disregard Père Pellico’s bigotry, and to build\r\nit where you please,” I cried.\r\n\r\nM. Blanc smiled, and said, “If your Serene Highness will excuse me, I had\r\nsooner not go against the Jesuits.”\r\n\r\nI wasn’t king in my own country, as it appeared.  Expel the Jesuits, the\r\ntempter within me suggested; but then I wasn’t Bismarck, and I hadn’t a\r\n“national liberal” party at my back.\r\n\r\nI rapidly exposed my views to M. Blanc.  I was much struck by the fact\r\nthat his practical mind insisted on viewing my reforms as questions not\r\nof principles but of men.\r\n\r\n“You have no men to back you,” he kept saying; “and if you turn out your\r\npresent set and get some clever Germans you will be deposed.”  He had\r\ndropped the excessive formality of speech with which he had begun.\r\nSeveral times he used the phrase, “Dr. Coulon is the only man you have.”\r\nThen, after thinking for a time, “What do you propose to gain by your\r\nreforms?  You are rich.  Your people are contented.  Why trouble\r\nyourself?  As for works of art, as for theatre, as for orchestra, these\r\nthings are matters of money, and I will do my best to help.  I am not\r\nsure that as a mere investment they will not pay, and at all events I\r\nwill do my best to make them do so; but as for your reforms of army,\r\nchurch, and education that you talk about, I beg your Highness to leave\r\nit all alone.  The shares in the bank will fall ten per cent. when it is\r\nknown.  My shares here are like the funds at Paris, they hate liberty.\r\nThe less liberty, the higher they stand.  It is just the same at Paris.\r\nSuppress a journal, and the _rente_ rise a franc.  Suppress all the\r\njournals, and they would rise five francs!  Suppress the Assembly, and\r\nthey would rise ten!  Does your Serene Highness take part in\r\npigeon-shooting?”\r\n\r\nMaking nothing of M. Blanc, except as to art matters, I returned slowly\r\nto the Castle, where I found the Council of State assembled to take the\r\noaths.\r\n\r\nI chatted with the members of the Council, but arranged to develope my\r\nplans in the first place to a few carefully-selected individuals.  I\r\nfixed hours at which I would receive M. de Payan; Dr. Coulon; the curé of\r\nthe cathedral; l’abbé Ramin; Père Pellico; and Colonel Jacquemet; after\r\nseeing the Governor General, Baron Imberty, and talking matters over with\r\nhim.  Baron Imberty I only saw because not to see him would be to pass a\r\nslight upon him; but I had no hope of help from him, and none from\r\nColonel Jacquemet.  From Père Pellico I knew that I should meet with\r\nopposition, and I received him only to see how strong and of what nature\r\nthe opposition would be.  I built my hopes upon M. de Payan, Dr. Coulon,\r\nand l’abbé Ramin.\r\n\r\nTo Baron Imberty I said only that I contemplated a reform in the army, a\r\ngradual liberation of the church from state control, and the\r\nre-organization of the schools.  He answered that my wish was law, but\r\nthat the church was very well as she stood.\r\n\r\nTo Colonel Jacquemet I explained in detail my military re-organization\r\nscheme, which was the best of my reforms.  I pointed out to him that his\r\nforce of forty men, now reduced to thirty-eight by the unfortunate wart\r\nand cold, was only preserved from becoming the laughing-stock of Europe\r\nby its exceptional discipline and courage.  It was absolutely necessary\r\nfor me to say this or he would have had a fit upon the spot.  I directed\r\nthat a list should be prepared of all the male inhabitants aged from\r\nsixteen to thirty, and numbering, as I calculated, about eight hundred.\r\nThat of them those physically fit—some six hundred, as I should\r\nsuppose—were to receive drill, and ultimately uniforms.  The gallant\r\nforty men were to become sergeants, corporals, and inferior officers of\r\nthe new national regiment.  Captain Ruggeri and Lieutenant Gasignol were\r\nnamed its majors, and Lieutenants Plati and De la Rosière the senior\r\ncaptains.  Four other captains were to be selected from among the\r\nprivates and non-commissioned officers of the guard.  The new levy was to\r\nbe unpaid, and the only increased expense would be the uniforms and\r\nrifles, and at first the additional pay of the ten new officers.  As\r\nvacancies occurred in company officers they were to be filled up by\r\nelection by the company, but the majors were to be appointed by the\r\ncolonel.  The cost of the uniforms and arms I proposed to meet by selling\r\nfor old iron our twenty magnificent, but useless pieces of old artillery.\r\nModern artillery for the fortress I proposed to provide out of my private\r\nincome, and as defence of the town was our only possible service, of\r\nfield artillery I decided to have none.  The night sentry duty at the\r\npalace was to be performed by the paid sergeants only, and the regiment\r\nwas to parade but once a week.  I could see that Colonel Jacquemet did\r\nnot like it, but he bowed and left the room.\r\n\r\nMy next interview was with M. de Payan.  He heartily concurred in my army\r\nreform, and said that no measure could be better for the country,\r\neducationally, than my plan of universal service of this limited\r\ncharacter.  When I came to talk of church reforms, however, M. de Payan\r\nwas very cold and hard to fire.  He advised me to talk the matter over\r\nwith the curé, l’abbé Ramin, a most moderate man, and to beware of Father\r\nPellico.  From this negative position I could not move him.\r\n\r\nThe curé was my next visitor.  He also agreed heartily in the wisdom of\r\nmy army reform.  He listened without dissent to my proposal for the\r\ngradual cessation of the small grant to the priests, including that to\r\nhimself.  On the other hand, when I spoke about the necessity of\r\nprocuring lay teachers for the schools, he began to weep.  I changed the\r\nsubject, and when I allowed him to leave the room he said, with a\r\nsingularly sweet smile, that he would go with my reforms as far as he\r\ncould, that so just a man as my Highness would not harm his country, that\r\nGod would watch over his church. I was touched by Abbé Ramin.\r\n\r\nDr. Coulon was then shown in.  A man of intellect, as I could see at the\r\nfirst glance.  I set before him my army reform, and he was delighted with\r\nit.  I touched upon the separation of church and state, and he said that\r\nit was not hard to be done at Monaco—in name, that is, but difficult\r\nindeed to be done in fact.  Still he supposed the name of separation was\r\nwhat I wanted, and the gradual cessation of the stipends, which would put\r\nMonaco in accord with the modern movement.  I then referred to education.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head, and answered, “I should be your Highness’s sole\r\nsupporter, and I am a materialist, and only tolerated here on account of\r\nmy medical skill, and placed on the Council of Education because, as I am\r\nnot in the habit of running my head against stone walls, I always side\r\nwith the Jesuits.”\r\n\r\nI insisted on the vast improvement in the standard of secular education\r\nto be expected from the introduction of highly trained lay teachers, and\r\nsaid that the priests should be absolutely free to teach the children out\r\nof school hours.\r\n\r\nHis reply was a singular one, and shook me.\r\n\r\n“Your Highness is a democrat,” he said.  “How then can your Highness\r\nimpose your will in this matter upon a people who are unanimous?  If your\r\nHighness wishes to escape individual responsibility for the existence of\r\nthe present state of things, your Highness can dissolve the council of\r\nstate and institute an elective parliament.  That parliament would\r\nconsist, let us say, of twelve members.  If so, eleven would be priests\r\nor Jesuits, and the twelfth M. Blanc of the Casino—a body which would\r\nresemble in complexion some of the school boards in your Highness’s\r\nfavourite England.  Your Highness has a heavy task, and if that task be\r\npersevered in, I fear that the state of your Highness’s nerves will be\r\nsuch as to require my prescriptions.”\r\n\r\nHe was very free in his conversation, the old doctor, but it was a\r\npleasing change after Baron Imberty and M. de Payan; not but what Abbé\r\nRamin had much attracted me.\r\n\r\nI did my best to charm Père Pellico.  I courted him as my other subjects\r\ncourted me.  He was expansive in manner; but I am not a fool, and though\r\nonly twenty-four, I knew enough of human nature to see that there was\r\nanother Père Pellico underneath the smiling case-work which talked to me.\r\nTo my military reform he had no objection, provided I exempted Jesuit\r\nstudents from service.  I answered that I would exempt all those at\r\npresent in Monaco, to which he replied that he feared then that I should\r\nnever have the pleasure of seeing any others.  I thought to myself “here\r\nis”—but Père Pellico smiled and slowly spoke again.\r\n\r\n“Your Highness was thinking, I venture to imagine, that that would be an\r\nadditional reason for hurrying your military reform.  But I must crave\r\nthe pardon of your Highness for speaking except in reply to your\r\nHighness.  I have not the habit of courts.”\r\n\r\nI spoke then of the Church; he was indifferent—the salaries of his four\r\nprofessors could easily be got from Italy.  I then touched upon\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nPère Pellico, to my astonishment, exclaimed, “But on the contrary; my\r\nopinions are not different from those of your Highness.  They are the\r\nsame.  But as a democrat I do not venture, although I may be wrong, to\r\nforce them upon the people.”\r\n\r\nHere was a change of base.\r\n\r\n“If I were your Highness,” he continued, “I would dismiss the Council of\r\nState and call an elected parliament to frame a constitution.  That would\r\nbe a more regular method of proceeding than limiting your own prerogative\r\nby the exercise of that very prerogative itself.”\r\n\r\n“Father,” I replied, “is not the country somewhat small for the\r\ncomplicated machinery of parliament?”\r\n\r\n“Why then not try a Plebiscite, ‘yes’ or ‘no,’ upon certain written\r\npropositions, as in Zurich?”\r\n\r\n“How liberal a politician can afford to be when he has the people with\r\nhim,” I thought to myself as I bowed out Father Pellico.\r\n\r\nFor the next three weeks, until the end of February, things went smoothly\r\nwith me.  My great aunt bothered me so to marry a “nice steady young lady\r\nwho would maintain the dignity of the Court, check the extravagance of\r\nthe steward, and count the linen,” that I got Dr. Coulon to tell her that\r\nshe would die unless she removed to Nice.  She preferred a short remove\r\nto a long one, and took herself off to my great relief.  She was a very\r\nfussy, but a clever and a really good old lady.  My army reform went well\r\nenough, and the church edict was fulminated without meeting with\r\nopposition.  I bought, through Mr. Gambart, who often came to Nice, a\r\ncharming Leighton and a glorious Watts, and a fine Verboeckhoven from M.\r\nBlanc, as a beginning of the public collection.  I moved the councils to\r\nthe palace, and fitted up the public offices thus rendered vacant as my\r\nmuseum.  I got M. Lucas at the Casino to improve his already admirable\r\norchestra, to start a free school for instrumental music, and to play\r\nonce a week in the town of Monaco instead of at Monte Carlo.  I wrote to\r\nM. Gounod, whom I had the honour to count among my friends, to offer him\r\nthe Louis Quinze rooms beyond the Chambre d’York, at the north-west\r\ncorner of the Castle, with the most lovely view in both directions, and\r\nthe prettiest decorations to my mind in all the palace, if he would come\r\nand stay with me as a permanent visitor, and countenance our musical\r\nefforts.  I founded a school for modelling in clay, a class in decorative\r\nart which I taught myself, and I made the arrangements for the reception\r\nof a troop of actors in the winter, and for the production of Gounod’s\r\n“Jeanne d’Arc”—a piece which was suggested by Père Pellico.  In the\r\npalace itself I made many improvements.  Of the Chambre d’York I left\r\nnothing but the pretty mosaic floor, but the room itself, which had been\r\ngilt from top to bottom, bed and all, by my great-grandfather to take out\r\nthe taste of the Great French Revolution, during which the palace had\r\nbeen a poor-house, I turned into a meeting room for the Council of State.\r\nMy steam yacht had come with a temporary crew of English tars, and my two\r\ngreat 15-inch 60-ton Krupp guns—one for the terrace, seawards, and one\r\nfor the garden, landwards—were ordered.  The “reports” had been\r\nabolished; the nagging surveillance of the police had been abolished; the\r\nChurch establishment had been abolished; and I then had nothing left to\r\nabolish but myself, the abolition of myself being a measure from which I\r\nshrank although, like King Leopold, I was ready to go if my subjects\r\nwished it.\r\n\r\nThe only one of my reforms which was really popular was the national\r\narmy, which afforded all the young married men in the principality a\r\nweekly holiday away from their wives.  But Major Gasignol, who had a\r\n“soul above buttons,” used on parade when he was acting as adjutant to\r\ntake an opportunity of reminding me of the days of glory when one of my\r\nancestors, Grimaldi II., about the time of the Norman conquest of\r\nEngland, had delivered at Rome the Pope from the forces of no less a\r\npersonage than the Emperor.\r\n\r\nAll this time, however, my education scheme and my substitution of an\r\nelective for a nominated council were in abeyance, the first on account\r\nof Père Pellico’s opposition, the second I might almost say on account of\r\nhis support.\r\n\r\nDr. Coulon, consulted by me, often used to say, “Why does not your\r\nHighness throw the responsibility upon a parliament of leaving matters\r\nwhere they are?”\r\n\r\n“But I wish to change them,” I as often replied.\r\n\r\n“I can understand that your Highness should wish to be thought to wish to\r\nchange them, but further than that point I can not follow your Highness.”\r\n\r\nI seriously thought of clapping Dr. Coulon into prison for his\r\nimpertinence, but then he was the only liberal in Monaco, and I was a\r\nliberal prince.  How I wished, though, that my uncle had not been such a\r\nfool as to invite the Jesuits, harassed in Italy in 1862, to take refuge\r\nin his dominions.\r\n\r\nI was no further advanced than my grandfather, Florestan I., who when\r\novertaken by the events of 1848, which lost him Mentone and Roquebrune,\r\ncontemplated a parliament, which however he never formed.  It was a funny\r\nconstitution was that one which he posted on the walls, and over which I\r\nhad often mused.  It had not gone further than being posted on the walls,\r\nI should add, because my grandfather found that it would not bring back\r\nMentone, and as he was strong enough to keep Monaco with or without it he\r\nhad, very sensibly, put it in the fire.  The 11th article of it was the\r\noddest:—“La presse sera libre, mais sujette à des lois répressives.”  But\r\nthe first article gave the tone to the whole:—“The sole religion of the\r\nState is the Catholic, Apostolic, Roman.”\r\n\r\nI strolled up the terraces of Monte Carlo, which always reminded me of\r\nJohn Martin’s idea of heaven, and consulted M. Blanc.  He was in\r\nespecially good humour that day, because “Madame Brisebanque” and “the\r\nMaltese” had both been losing money.  Still, when I talked of my\r\nparliament and my education reform, he talked of “Jacob’s ladder” and of\r\nother infallible systems of ruining him which never had any result except\r\nthat of beggaring their authors.  He told me a long-winded story of how\r\nat Homburg a company called “La Contrebanque” had won twenty-four days in\r\nsuccession, and how on the twenty-fifth they had sent for a watchman and\r\nan iron chest to guard their winnings, how that afternoon their secretary\r\nhad lost the whole capital in eighteen _coups_, and how the innocent\r\nwatchman had marched up and down all night religiously guarding an empty\r\nchest.  I tried to hark back to my subject, when off he went again at a\r\ntangent, and told me how the day before on opening the “bienfaisance”\r\ncollection-box in the hall of the hotel they had found no money, but all\r\nthe letters of an American gentleman who had posted them there the year\r\nbefore.  Another of his anecdotes was of a lady who, having lost, had\r\neaten a thousand-franc note on a slice of bread and butter to improve her\r\nluck.  M. Blanc left the Casino in his carriage just after I had ridden\r\noff, and without seeming to look I saw well enough out of the corner of\r\nmy eyes after he had passed me on the road, that the people uncovered to\r\nhim more universally and for a longer time than to myself.  There was,\r\nhowever, one difference between us—I returned the bows and he did not.\r\n\r\nI gave up M. Blanc and pursued my reforming course, abandoning, however,\r\nthe idea of a parliament and fearing to touch education.  My government,\r\nnow in working order, resembled in no way that which you English think\r\nthe best of all possible polities—“constitutional monarchy”—which with\r\nyou appears to me to mean a democratic republic tempered by snobbism and\r\ncorruption.  Mine was a socialistic autocracy, which, in spite of my\r\nfailure, I maintain to be the best of governments, provided only that you\r\ncan secure the best of autocrats.\r\n\r\nI had no one to back me in what I did.  Major Gasignol and some of the\r\nother officers were strongly favourable to the army reform, which gave\r\nthem service and promotion.  Dr. Coulon was half favourable to my views,\r\nand a quarter favourable to my ways of working them out in action.\r\nL’Abbé Ramin was conciliatory and kind.  M. de Payan was grimly neutral.\r\nEvery other functionary was an active, though veiled, enemy to\r\nnine-tenths of my proposals.  The people were abjectly passive, and I\r\nalmost wished that the auberge of the “_Crapaud Volant_” of _Rabagas_ had\r\nhad a real existence.  At last, however, I conjured up the spirit to\r\nfound a school with lay teachers, arranging to pay its cost over and\r\nabove the expected fees out of my own purse.  No one came to it, and the\r\nJesuit schools and the schools of the _frères de la doctrine_ continued\r\nto be thronged.  The Catholic schools were supported by the state.  Mine\r\nwere supported by myself.  I went a step further, and I offered Father\r\nPellico the alternatives of stopping the state contributions to all\r\nschools, or of continuing them, provided that lay teachers only were\r\nemployed during the principal hours of the day.  He coldly said that an\r\nagreement of the nature proposed by me would be contrary to his duty, and\r\nthat if I chose to stop the state contributions to his schools the effect\r\nof my action would be to shake my throne without harming them.  He added\r\nthat if he was to go to prison he was at the service of my officer of the\r\nguard.  I replied that he was welcome to his opinion.\r\n\r\nThe next day the edict appeared.  It was countersigned by Baron Imberty,\r\nwho disapproved of it, but not by M. de Payan, who had resigned and left\r\nfor Nice to consult the Bishop.  As I drove through the town in the\r\nafternoon, I was coldly received by the people, and the proclamation was\r\ntorn down on the following night.  The weekly parade of the militia was\r\nput off for fear of a hostile demonstration; and on the day on which it\r\nwould have taken place I received, instead of the muster-roll of the\r\nnational regiment, a vote of thanks from the Executive Committee of the\r\nEnglish National Education League, and notice of my unanimous election to\r\nmembership of the Council of that body.\r\n\r\nA strange event occurred in the afternoon, (it was the 11th of March), to\r\ndistract my thoughts.  General Garibaldi, who had been travelling\r\n_incognito_, and with the permission of the French Government, given\r\nconditionally on the _incognito_ being strictly preserved, to visit his\r\nbirthplace—Nice, applied to me to know whether I would receive him if he\r\nstopped at Monaco for a day on his return.  I replied that I should be\r\nglad to see him, the more so as I had met his son Ricciotti at Greenwich\r\nin June 1870, at the dinner of the Cobden Club, to which orgy he and I\r\nhad both been lured by the solicitations of the arch-gastronomist, the\r\njovial Mr. T. B. Potter.  I did not add that our acquaintance had been\r\ninterrupted by the war in which the same clever and conceited officer had\r\ncut up my cousin’s (the King of Wurtemberg) troops at\r\nChâtillon-sur-Seine.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th the old General came, and I met him at the station and drove\r\nhim to the palace.  The news that he was with me soon spread through the\r\ntown, and a mob collected at the palace gates.  The General, to whom I\r\nhad given the “bishop’s rooms,” which had once been occupied by\r\nMonseigneur Dupanloup, his arch enemy, imagined that the crowd was\r\ncomposed of his admirers, and, leaning upon his stick, he proceeded to\r\nharangue them from the window of the private apartments.  Some hundreds\r\nof my subjects, I was afterwards informed, had listened to him languidly\r\nenough until he began to attack the Jesuits, when arose the uproar which\r\nbrought me to his room, and all my household into the courtyard.  I\r\nbegged him to remember where he was, but the howling of the mob had\r\nexcited the old lion, and the more they threatened the more violently he\r\ndeclaimed.  When he was pulled into a chair by Major Gasignol the\r\nmischief was done, and a maddened crowd was raging on the _place_ crying\r\n“à bas Garibaldi,” “à bas les Communistes,” “à bas le Prince.”\r\n\r\nColonel Jacquemet made his way to me and said, “Sir, I can count on\r\ntwenty of the sergeants and corporals who are in the courtyard,\r\nex-soldiers of your Highness’s ex-garde.  They are grand old soldiers,\r\nand with the strong walls to help them will hold this _canaille_ in\r\ncheck.”\r\n\r\nHe might have said, “Sir, I don’t like your ways, and have disapproved of\r\neverything that you have done, but after all you are the rightful Prince\r\nof Monaco, as well as a good fellow, saving your Highness’s presence, and\r\nI am ready to die for you.”  He didn’t.  He only spoke the words that I\r\nhave set down.\r\n\r\nMy answer was an unhesitating one.\r\n\r\n“I, Prince Florestan the Reformer, am not going to hold my throne by\r\nforce if I can’t hold it by love; and, moreover, if I wished to do so it\r\nis doubtful whether I could succeed.”\r\n\r\nAs I spoke the crowd parted asunder, and I saw advancing through it in a\r\nwedge the English blue-jackets from my yacht, armed with cutlasses.  A\r\nfew stones were thrown at them, but of these they took not the smallest\r\nnotice.  At their head was the captain of the port, a native Monegascan,\r\nthe very man who years before had saved my sailor cousin from the waves.\r\nThey entered the courtyard, and I at once asked them to make their way,\r\nwith General Garibaldi in the midst, back to the yacht, and steam with\r\nhim to Mentone, land him, and return.  At the same time I sent for Father\r\nPellico.  It was lucky the sailors had come, for I soon discovered that\r\nthe carbineers had made common cause with the mob, and that the sergeants\r\nwho were ready to die for me would not have escorted Garibaldi.\r\n\r\nThe mob howled dismally as he left, but he was embarked safely just\r\nbefore Father Pellico reached the palace gate.  I told him that the\r\nGeneral had left, and asked him whether this concession would satisfy the\r\ncrowd.  He asked whether I was prepared at the same time to give way\r\nabout the schools.  I told him that if I thought that after doing so I\r\ncould continue to reign with advantage to the country and credit to\r\nmyself I would willingly give way, but that if he thought that in the\r\nevent of my abdication the public peace could be maintained until a vote\r\nwas taken to decide the future of the country, I should prefer to return\r\nto my books and to my boat.  He said that he hoped that I should stop,\r\nbut that if, on the other hand, I went he thought that order would be\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nI bowed to him and said, “Père Pellico, you may if you please occupy the\r\nthrone of the Grimaldis.  I shall leave in an hour when the yacht\r\nreturns.”\r\n\r\nI went on to the balcony and attempted to address the crowd.  If they\r\nwould have listened to a word I said I might have turned them, but not a\r\nsyllable could be heard.  I could not “address my remarks to the\r\nreporters,” because owing to the wise precautions of my predecessor with\r\nregard to the press there were none.  I retired amid a shower of small\r\nstones.\r\n\r\nColonel Jacquemet’s language was fearful to listen to.  The air was thick\r\nwith his curses.  I was reminded of the question of a little girl friend\r\nof mine, who having been taken out one day to an inspection by the\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the garrison of Portsmouth upon Southsea common,\r\nasked on her return home if “the Duke of Cambridge wasn’t a very pious\r\nman,” explaining that she had heard him “say his prayers”—alluding\r\ndoubtless to His Royal Highness’s favourite expression of “God bless my\r\nbody and soul!”  If he had ever read history the colonel would have known\r\nthat the fire-eating d’Artagnan of “Three Musketeers” renown once\r\ncommanded the fortress of Monaco for Louis the Fourteenth, under my\r\nancestor the Marshal, and he might have been inspired by a desire to\r\nemulate his fame, but, as it was, he seemed chiefly moved by a loathing\r\nfor his tattered fellow-subjects.  He wanted to mow them with grape—of\r\nwhich we had none; he wanted to blow them into the air—but to reason with\r\nhim was useless, and I was unable even to fix his attention enough to bid\r\nhim farewell.\r\n\r\nAs I left the palace, surrounded by the tars and preceded and followed by\r\nthe sergeants of the ex-garde, Abbé Ramin came running up and seized me\r\nby the hand.\r\n\r\n“Your Serene Highness must not leave us,” he cried; “the people are\r\nirritated for a moment against their prince, but happier days will come.”\r\n\r\n“I can stop if I please, Abbé Ramin,” I replied, “but only either by\r\nfiring upon the people, or by blockading them and depriving the women and\r\nchildren of the upper town of their daily bread.  I will do neither.”\r\n\r\n“History will speak of your Highness as your Highness deserves!”\r\n\r\n“My dear friend—for I believe you are my only friend in Monaco—I thank\r\nyou for coming to bid me farewell, but don’t talk of history, for history\r\nwill only declare me to have been an obstinate young fool.”\r\n\r\nWe moved off slowly down the hill amid the hisses of the crowd.  The\r\nsergeants formed square upon the quay, I embraced Colonel Jacquemet and\r\nthe Abbé, stepped into the gig, and in a minute was on board.  Steam was\r\nup, and the next evening I landed at Marseilles.\r\n\r\nBy a telegram from the Abbé I learnt that an informal vote of the adult\r\nmale inhabitants of the principality had been taken that day, and that\r\nthe result was this:—\r\n\r\n                         For Annexation to France\r\n\r\n                               1131—_Oui_.\r\n                                 1—_Non_.\r\n\r\nThe _Non_ was M. Blanc, who, being a Frenchman, ought not to have been\r\nallowed to vote at all.  I heard afterwards that on learning my departure\r\nhe had pronounced the following epitaph upon me:—\r\n\r\n“Ah le jeune homme est parti.  Je m’y attendais.  Il aimait la liberté\r\ncelui là.”\r\n\r\nThe Casino is removed to Cairo, and M. Blanc’s eldest daughter is to\r\nmarry the Viceroy’s youngest son.\r\n\r\nMy tutor at Cambridge received me with a solemn face; but I laughingly\r\nexclaimed, “You see, Sir, after all I did want an _exeat_, even if an\r\n_absit_ would not have done.”\r\n\r\nThe only later news that I have to record is a letter from my friend\r\nGambetta, promising that when he becomes President of France I shall be\r\npréfêt of the Department of the Alpes Maritimes, which includes my\r\nex-dominions, on condition that I am very moderate.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n                                   END.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nThere is no moral that can be drawn from my fall applicable to the\r\npresent state of English politics.  This may be seen indeed from the\r\ncomments of the only three English papers of last Friday and Saturday\r\nthat noticed it.  The _Morning Advertiser_, which, Tory as it is, prefers\r\nRadical-Orangeism to Tory-Popery (and beer to both), classed me along\r\nwith the Tichborne claimant as a victim to the Jesuits, whereas I wasn’t\r\na victim at all; and if I had been, should have been a victim to my own\r\nobstinacy, as I certainly could have stopped at Monaco if I had pleased\r\nto do so—either by raising a popular clamour against the priests, which\r\nwould have been immoral, or by accepting Père Pellico’s conditions, which\r\nwould have been humiliating.  The _National Reformer_, the organ of Mr.\r\nBradlaugh, patted me on the back as an ill-used republican; and the\r\n_Standard_ said that my fall showed the absolute necessity of maintaining\r\nthe 25th clause of the Education Act intact, which is what I could not\r\nfor the life of me see.  On the contrary, so opposite are the conditions\r\nof England and of Monaco, that what would have succeeded in one would\r\nhave failed in the other as a matter of course.  In England you have a\r\ndivided church; an increasing and active though still little numerous\r\nCatholic body; a materialistic world of fashion which goes alternately to\r\nMr. Wilkinson and Canon Liddon, Mr. Haweis and Mr. Stopford Brooke, and\r\ndoes not believe a word that any of them says—unless it is Mr. Haweis,\r\nbut then, doctrinally speaking, he says nothing.  You have the old\r\nnonconformist bodies, able and powerful still, though less powerful than\r\nbefore 1868; and you have the Wesleyans, pulpy but rich.  Outside of them\r\nall you have people who believe two-thirds of them in the Bible pure and\r\nsimple, but with prominence given in their minds to the communistic side\r\nof the New Testament, and one-third in nothing unless it is Mr. Charles\r\nWatts, Mr. Austin Holyoake, and Mr. Bradlaugh.  The most flourishing\r\npublications in your country are _Zadkiel’s Almanac_ and _Reynolds’\r\nNewspaper_, belonging to the opposite poles, but equally at war with all\r\nthat is most powerful and rich and respectable in your society.  What\r\nresemblance is there in this state of things, full of life but wholly\r\nwanting in unity, to that at Monaco, dead, but single in faith?  At\r\nMonaco all that believed—and most believed—were earnest Catholics,\r\nwielded for political purposes by one man.  Had my parliamentary scheme\r\nbeen carried out the cumulative vote would have been inoperative, and Mr.\r\nHare had he been there would have hanged himself from the castle\r\nflag-staff, for there was no minority.  As in East Prussia the peasants,\r\nsuddenly presented with universal suffrage by Von Bismarck and asked for\r\nwhom they would vote, said with one accord, “For the King.”—“You\r\ncan’t”—“Then for the Crown Prince”—so at Monaco the population would have\r\nreplied “for Père Pellico.”\r\n\r\nAll the same there is a moral to be drawn from my fall, and it applies to\r\nthe French Republic.  I conjure my friends of the French radical party\r\nnot to let radicalism in France be bound up with indecent speeches made\r\nover the graves at “civil funerals,” or with the denial of the\r\nImmortality of the Soul.  In England, in spite of occasional attempts of\r\nthe _Standard_ to couple “atheists” and “republicans,” no such warning is\r\nneeded; but in France it comes almost too late.  No system of government\r\ncan be permanent which has for its opponents all the women in the\r\ncountry, and for supporters only half the men; and any party will have\r\nfor opponents all the women which couples the religious question with the\r\npolitical and the social, and raises the flag of materialism.  Women are\r\nnot likely to abandon the idea of a compensation in the next world for\r\nthe usage which too many of them meet with in this.\r\n\r\nAs for my failure at Monaco, I went too fast.  I agree with Mr. Freeman,\r\nyour English historian, that a sudden breach in the continuity of\r\nnational institutions is an evil, and that “the witness of history\r\nteaches us that, in changing a long established form of executive\r\ngovernment, the more gently and warily the work is done the more likely\r\nit is to be lasting.”  I could have stopped at Monaco by humbling myself,\r\nbut at all events I went too fast.  If they take me back, which I really\r\nthink for their own sakes they had better do, I will go much slower.  But\r\nI have no time to write any more, for I have been put without training\r\ninto the first boat, and we are to stop up during the greater portion of\r\nthe Easter “vac.,” as we have a capital chance of “keeping head.”",
