This is such a time.\r\n\r\nI say this not only because 1970 marks the beginning of a new decade in\r\nwhich America will celebrate its 200th birthday. I say it because new\r\nknowledge and hard experience argue persuasively that both our programs and\r\nour institutions in America need to be reformed.\r\n\r\nThe moment has arrived to harness the vast energies and abundance of this\r\nland to the creation of a new American experience, an experience richer and\r\ndeeper and more truly a reflection of the goodness and grace of the human\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nThe seventies will be a time of new beginnings, a time of exploring both on\r\nthe earth and in the heavens, a time of discovery. But the time has also\r\ncome for emphasis on developing better ways of managing what we have and of\r\ncompleting what man's genius has begun but left unfinished.\r\n\r\nOur land, this land that is ours together, is a great and a good land. It\r\nis also an unfinished land, and the challenge of perfecting it is the\r\nsummons of the seventies.\r\n\r\nIt is in that spirit that I address myself to those great issues facing our\r\nNation which are above partisanship.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of America's priorities the first priority must always be\r\npeace for America and the world.\r\n\r\nThe major immediate goal of our foreign policy is to bring an end to the\r\nwar in Vietnam in a way that our generation will be remembered not so much\r\nas the generation that suffered in war, but more for the fact that we had\r\nthe courage and character to win the kind of a just peace that the next\r\ngeneration was able to keep.\r\n\r\nWe are making progress toward that goal.\r\n\r\nThe prospects for peace are far greater today than they were a year ago.\r\n\r\nA major part of the credit for this development goes to the Members of this\r\nCongress who, despite their differences on the conduct of the war, have\r\noverwhelmingly indicated their support of a just peace. By this action, you\r\nhave completely demolished the enemy's hopes that they can gain in\r\nWashington the victory our fighting men have denied them in Vietnam.\r\n\r\nNo goal could be greater than to make the next generation the first in this\r\ncentury in which America was at peace with every nation in the world.\r\n\r\nI shall discuss in detail the new concepts and programs designed to achieve\r\nthis goal in a separate report on foreign policy, which I shall submit to\r\nthe Congress at a later date.\r\n\r\nToday, let me describe the directions of our new policies.\r\n\r\nWe have based our policies on an evaluation of the world as it is, not as\r\nit was 25 years ago at the conclusion of World War II. Many of the policies\r\nwhich were necessary and right then are obsolete today.\r\n\r\nThen, because of America's overwhelming military and economic strength,\r\nbecause of the weakness of other major free world powers and the inability\r\nof scores of newly independent nations to defend, or even govern,\r\nthemselves, America had to assume the major burden for the defense of\r\nfreedom in the world.\r\n\r\nIn two wars, first in Korea and now in Vietnam, we furnished most of the\r\nmoney, most of the arms, most of the men to help other nations defend their\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nToday the great industrial nations of Europe, as well as Japan, have\r\nregained their economic strength; and the nations of Latin America--and\r\nmany of the nations who acquired their freedom from colonialism after World\r\nWar II in Asia and Africa--have a new sense of pride and dignity and a\r\ndetermination to assume the responsibility for their own defense.\r\n\r\nThat is the basis of the doctrine I announced at Guam.\r\n\r\nNeither the defense nor the development of other nations can be exclusively\r\nor primarily an American undertaking.\r\n\r\nThe nations of each part of the world should assume the primary\r\nresponsibility for their own well-being; and they themselves should\r\ndetermine the terms of that well-being.\r\n\r\nWe shall be faithful to our treaty commitments, but we shall reduce our\r\ninvolvement and our presence in other nations' affairs.\r\n\r\nTo insist that other nations play a role is not a retreat from\r\nresponsibility; it is a sharing of responsibility.\r\n\r\nThe result of this new policy has been not to weaken our alliances, but to\r\ngive them new life, new strength, a new sense of common purpose.\r\n\r\nRelations with our European allies are once again strong and healthy, based\r\non mutual consultation and mutual responsibility.\r\n\r\nWe have initiated a new approach to Latin America in which we deal with\r\nthose nations as partners rather than patrons.\r\n\r\nThe new partnership concept has been welcomed in Asia. We have developed an\r\nhistoric new basis for Japanese-American friendship and cooperation, which\r\nis the linchpin for peace in the Pacific.\r\n\r\nIf we are to have peace in the last third of the century, a major factor\r\nwill be the development of a new relationship between the United States and\r\nthe Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nI would not underestimate our differences, but we are moving with precision\r\nand purpose from an era of confrontation to an era of negotiation.\r\n\r\nOur negotiations on strategic arms limitations and in other areas will have\r\nfar greater chance for success if both sides enter them motivated by mutual\r\nself-interest rather than naive sentimentality.\r\n\r\nIt is with this same spirit that we have resumed discussions with Communist\r\nChina in our talks at Warsaw.\r\n\r\nOur concern in our relations with both these nations is to avoid a\r\ncatastrophic collision and to build a solid basis for peaceful settlement\r\nof our differences.\r\n\r\nI would be the last to suggest that the road to peace is not difficult and\r\ndangerous, but I believe our new policies have contributed to the prospect\r\nthat America may have the best chance since World War II to enjoy a\r\ngeneration of uninterrupted peace. And that chance will be enormously\r\nincreased if we continue to have a relationship between Congress and the\r\nExecutive in which, despite differences in detail, where the security of\r\nAmerica and the peace of mankind are concerned, we act not as Republicans,\r\nnot as Democrats, but as Americans.\r\n\r\nAs we move into the decade of the seventies, we have the greatest\r\nopportunity for progress at home of any people in world history.\r\n\r\nOur gross national product will increase by $500 billion in the next 10\r\nyears. This increase alone is greater than the entire growth of the\r\nAmerican economy from 1790 to 1950.\r\n\r\nThe critical question is not whether we will grow, but how we will use that\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nThe decade of the sixties was also a period of great growth economically.\r\nBut in that same 10-year period we witnessed the greatest growth of crime,\r\nthe greatest increase in inflation, the greatest social unrest in America\r\nin 100 years. Never has a nation seemed to have had more and enjoyed it\r\nless.\r\n\r\nAt heart, the issue is the effectiveness of government.\r\n\r\nOurs has become--as it continues to be, and should remain--a society of\r\nlarge expectations. Government helped to generate these expectations. It\r\nundertook to meet them. Yet, increasingly, it proved unable to do so.\r\n\r\nAs a people, we had too many visions--and too little vision.\r\n\r\nNow, as we enter the seventies, we should enter also a great age of reform\r\nof the institutions of American government.\r\n\r\nOur purpose in this period should not be simply better management of the\r\nprograms of the past. The time has come for a new quest--a quest not for a\r\ngreater quantity of what we have, but for a new quality of life in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nA major part of the substance for an unprecedented advance in this Nation's\r\napproach to its problems and opportunities is contained in more than two\r\nscore legislative proposals which I sent to the Congress last year and\r\nwhich still await enactment.\r\n\r\nI will offer at least a dozen more major programs in the course of this\r\nsession.\r\n\r\nAt this point I do not intend to go through a detailed listing of what I\r\nhave proposed or will propose, but I would like to mention three areas in\r\nwhich urgent priorities demand that we move and move now:\r\n\r\nFirst, we cannot delay longer in accomplishing a total reform of our\r\nwelfare system. When a system penalizes work, breaks up homes, robs\r\nrecipients of dignity, there is no alternative to abolishing that system\r\nand adopting in its place the program of income support, job training, and\r\nwork incentives which I recommended to the Congress last year.\r\n\r\nSecond, the time has come to assess and reform all of our institutions of\r\ngovernment at the Federal, State, and local level. It is time for a New\r\nFederalism, in which, after 190 years of power flowing from the people and\r\nlocal and State governments to Washington, D.C., it will begin to flow from\r\nWashington back to the States and to the people of the United States.\r\n\r\nThird, we must adopt reforms which will expand the range of opportunities\r\nfor all Americans. We can fulfill the American dream only when each person\r\nhas a fair chance to fulfill his own dreams. This means equal voting\r\nrights, equal employment opportunity, and new opportunities for expanded\r\nownership. Because in order to be secure in their human rights, people need\r\naccess to property rights.\r\n\r\nI could give similar examples of the need for reform in our programs for\r\nhealth, education, housing, transportation, as well as other critical areas\r\nwhich directly affect the well-being of millions of Americans.\r\n\r\nThe people of the United States should wait no longer for these reforms\r\nthat would so deeply enhance the quality of their life.\r\n\r\nWhen I speak of actions which would be beneficial to the American people, I\r\ncan think of none more important than for the Congress to join this\r\nadministration in the battle to stop the rise in the cost of living.\r\n\r\nNow, I realize it is tempting to blame someone else for inflation. Some\r\nblame business for raising prices. Some blame unions for asking for more\r\nwages.\r\n\r\nBut a review of the stark fiscal facts of the 1960's clearly demonstrates\r\nwhere the primary blame for rising prices must be placed.\r\n\r\nIn the decade of the sixties the Federal Government spent $57 billion more\r\nthan it took in in taxes.\r\n\r\nIn that same decade the American people paid the bill for that deficit in\r\nprice increases which raised the cost of living for the average family of\r\nfour by $200 per month in America.\r\n\r\nNow millions of Americans are forced to go into debt today because the\r\nFederal Government decided to go into debt yesterday. We must balance our\r\nFederal budget so that American families will have a better chance to\r\nbalance their family budgets.\r\n\r\nOnly with the cooperation of the Congress can we meet this highest priority\r\nobjective of responsible government. We are on the right track.\r\n\r\nWe had a balanced budget in 1969. This administration cut more than $7\r\nbillion out of spending plans in order to produce a surplus in 1970, and in\r\nspite of the fact that Congress reduced revenues by $3 billion, I shall\r\nrecommend a balanced budget for 1971.\r\n\r\nBut I can assure you that not only to present, but to stay within, a\r\nbalanced budget requires some very hard decisions. It means rejecting\r\nspending programs which would benefit some of the people when their net\r\neffect would result in price increases for all the people.\r\n\r\nIt is time to quit putting good money into bad programs. Otherwise, we will\r\nend up with bad money and bad programs.\r\n\r\nI recognize the political popularity of spending programs, and particularly\r\nin an election year. But unless we stop the rise in prices, the cost of\r\nliving for millions of American families will become unbearable and\r\ngovernment's ability to plan programs for progress for the future will\r\nbecome impossible.\r\n\r\nIn referring to budget cuts, there is one area where I have ordered an\r\nincrease rather than a cut--and that is the requests of those agencies with\r\nthe responsibilities for law enforcement.\r\n\r\nWe have heard a great deal of overblown rhetoric during the sixties in\r\nwhich the word \"war\" has perhaps too often been used--the war on poverty,\r\nthe war on misery, the war on disease, the war on hunger. But if there is\r\none area where the word \"war\" is appropriate it is in the fight against\r\ncrime. We must declare and win the war against the criminal elements which\r\nincreasingly threaten our cities, our homes, and our lives.\r\n\r\nWe have a tragic example of this problem in the Nation's Capital, for whose\r\nsafety the Congress and the Executive have the primary responsibility. I\r\ndoubt if many Members of this Congress who live more than a few blocks from\r\nhere would dare leave their cars in the Capitol garage and walk home alone\r\ntonight.\r\n\r\nLast year this administration sent to the Congress 13 separate pieces of\r\nlegislation dealing with organized crime, pornography, street crime,\r\nnarcotics, crime in the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\nNone of these bills has reached my desk for signature.\r\n\r\nI am confident that the Congress will act now to adopt the legislation I\r\nplaced before you last year. We in the Executive have done everything we\r\ncan under existing law, but new and stronger weapons are needed in that\r\nfight.\r\n\r\nWhile it is true that State and local law enforcement agencies are the\r\ncutting edge in the effort to eliminate street crime, burglaries, murder,\r\nmy proposals to you have embodied my belief that the Federal Government\r\nshould play a greater role in working in partnership with these agencies.\r\n\r\nThat is why 1971 Federal spending for local law enforcement will double\r\nthat budgeted for 1970.\r\n\r\nThe primary responsibility for crimes that affect individuals is with local\r\nand State rather than with Federal Government. But in the field of\r\norganized crime, narcotics, pornography, the Federal Government has a\r\nspecial responsibility it should fulfill. And we should make Washington,\r\nD.C., where we have the primary responsibility, an example to the Nation\r\nand the world of respect for law rather than lawlessness.\r\n\r\nI now turn to a subject which, next to our desire for peace, may well\r\nbecome the major concern of the American people in the decade of the\r\nseventies.\r\n\r\nIn the next 10 years we shall increase our wealth by 50 percent. The\r\nprofound question is: Does this mean we will be 50 percent richer in a real\r\nsense, 50 percent better off, 50 percent happier?\r\n\r\nOr does it mean that in the year 1980 the President standing in this place\r\nwill look back on a decade in which 70 percent of our people lived in\r\nmetropolitan areas choked by traffic, suffocated by smog, poisoned by\r\nwater, deafened by noise, and terrorized by crime?\r\n\r\nThese are not the great questions that concern world leaders at summit\r\nconferences. But people do not live at the summit. They live in the\r\nfoothills of everyday experience, and it is time for all of us to concern\r\nourselves with the way real people live in real life.\r\n\r\nThe great question of the seventies is, shall we surrender to our\r\nsurroundings, or shall we make our peace with nature and begin to make\r\nreparations for the damage we have done to our air, to our land, and to our\r\nwater?\r\n\r\nRestoring nature to its natural state is a cause beyond party and beyond\r\nfactions. It has become a common cause of all the people of this country.\r\nIt is a cause of particular concern to young Americans, because they more\r\nthan we will reap the grim consequences of our failure to act on programs\r\nwhich are needed now if we are to prevent disaster later.\r\n\r\nClean air, clean water, open spaces--these should once again be the\r\nbirthright of every American. If we act now, they can be.\r\n\r\nWe still think of air as free. But clean air is not free, and neither is\r\nclean water. The price tag on pollution control is high. Through our years\r\nof past carelessness we incurred a debt to nature, and now that debt is\r\nbeing called.\r\n\r\nThe program I shall propose to Congress will be the most comprehensive and\r\ncostly program in this field in America's history.\r\n\r\nIt is not a program for just one year. A year's plan in this field is no\r\nplan at all. This is a time to look ahead not a year, but 5 years or 10\r\nyears--whatever time is required to do the job.\r\n\r\nI shall propose to this Congress a $10 billion nationwide clean waters\r\nprogram to put modern municipal waste treatment plants in every place in\r\nAmerica where they are needed to make our waters clean again, and do it\r\nnow. We have the industrial capacity, if we begin now, to build them all\r\nwithin 5 years. This program will get them built within 5 years.\r\n\r\nAs our cities and suburbs relentlessly expand, those priceless open spaces\r\nneeded for recreation areas accessible to their people are swallowed\r\nup--often forever. Unless we preserve these spaces while they are still\r\navailable, we will have none to preserve. Therefore, I shall propose new\r\nfinancing methods for purchasing open space and parklands now, before they\r\nare lost to us.\r\n\r\nThe automobile is our worst polluter of the air. Adequate control requires\r\nfurther advances in engine design and fuel composition. We shall intensify\r\nour research, set increasingly strict standards, and strengthen enforcement\r\nprocedures--and we shall do it now.\r\n\r\nWe can no longer afford to consider air and water common property, free to\r\nbe abused by anyone without regard to the consequences. Instead, we should\r\nbegin now to treat them as scarce resources, which we are no more free to\r\ncontaminate than we are free to throw garbage into our neighbor's yard.\r\n\r\nThis requires comprehensive new regulations. It also requires that, to the\r\nextent possible, the price of goods should be made to include the costs of\r\nproducing and disposing of them without damage to the environment.\r\n\r\nNow, I realize that the argument is often made that there is a fundamental\r\ncontradiction between economic growth and the quality of life, so that to\r\nhave one we must forsake the other.\r\n\r\nThe answer is not to abandon growth, but to redirect it. For example, we\r\nshould turn toward ending congestion and eliminating smog the same\r\nreservoir of inventive genius that created them in the first place.\r\n\r\nContinued vigorous economic growth provides us with the means to enrich\r\nlife itself and to enhance our planet as a place hospitable to man.\r\n\r\nEach individual must enlist in this fight if it is to be won.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that no matter how many national parks and historical\r\nmonuments we buy and develop, the truly significant environment for each of\r\nus is that in which we spend 80 percent of our time--in our homes, in our\r\nplaces of work, the streets over which we travel.\r\n\r\nStreet litter, rundown parking strips and yards, dilapidated fences, broken\r\nwindows, smoking automobiles, dingy working places, all should be the\r\nobject of our fresh view.\r\n\r\nWe have been too tolerant of our surroundings and too willing to leave it\r\nto others to clean up our environment. It is time for those who make\r\nmassive demands on society to make some minimal demands on themselves. Each\r\nof us must resolve that each day he will leave his home, his property, the\r\npublic places of the city or town a little cleaner, a little better, a\r\nlittle more pleasant for himself and those around him.\r\n\r\nWith the help of people we can do anything, and without their help, we can\r\ndo nothing. In this spirit, together, we can reclaim our land for ours and\r\ngenerations to come.\r\n\r\nBetween now and the year 2000, over 100 million children will be born in\r\nthe United States. Where they grow up--and how--will, more than any one\r\nthing, measure the quality of American life in these years ahead.\r\n\r\nThis should be a warning to us.\r\n\r\nFor the past 30 years our population has also been growing and shifting.\r\nThe result is exemplified in the vast areas of rural America emptying out\r\nof people and of promise--a third of our counties lost population in the\r\nsixties.\r\n\r\nThe violent and decayed central cities of our great metropolitan complexes\r\nare the most conspicuous area of failure in American life today.\r\n\r\nI propose that before these problems become insoluble, the Nation develop a\r\nnational growth policy.\r\n\r\nIn the future, government decisions as to where to build highways, locate\r\nairports, acquire land, or sell land should be made with a clear objective\r\nof aiding a balanced growth for America.\r\n\r\nIn particular, the Federal Government must be in a position to assist in\r\nthe building of new cities and the rebuilding of old ones.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, we will carry our concern with the quality of life in\r\nAmerica to the farm as well as the suburb, to the village as well as to the\r\ncity. What rural America needs most is a new kind of assistance. It needs\r\nto be dealt with, not as a separate nation, but as part of an overall\r\ngrowth policy for America. We must create a new rural environment which\r\nwill not only stem the migration to urban centers, but reverse it. If we\r\nseize our growth as a challenge, we can make the 1970's an historic period\r\nwhen by conscious choice we transformed our land into what we want it to\r\nbecome.\r\n\r\nAmerica, which has pioneered in the new abundance, and in the new\r\ntechnology, is called upon today to pioneer in meeting the concerns which\r\nhave followed in their wake--in turning the wonders of science to the\r\nservice of man.\r\n\r\nIn the majesty of this great Chamber we hear the echoes of America's\r\nhistory, of debates that rocked the Union and those that repaired it, of\r\nthe summons to war and the search for peace, of the uniting of the people,\r\nthe building of a nation.\r\n\r\nThose echoes of history remind us of our roots and our strengths.\r\n\r\nThey remind us also of that special genius of American democracy, which at\r\none critical turning point after another has led us to spot the new road to\r\nthe future and given us the wisdom and the courage to take it.\r\n\r\nAs I look down that new road which I have tried to map out today, I see a\r\nnew America as we celebrate our 200th anniversary 6 years from now.\r\n\r\nI see an America in which we have abolished hunger, provided the means for\r\nevery family in the Nation to obtain a minimum income, made enormous\r\nprogress in providing better housing, faster transportation, improved\r\nhealth, and superior education.\r\n\r\nI see an America in which we have checked inflation, and waged a winning\r\nwar against crime.\r\n\r\nI see an America in which we have made great strides in stopping the\r\npollution of our air, cleaning up our water, opening up our parks,\r\ncontinuing to explore in space.\r\n\r\nMost important, I see an America at peace with all the nations of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThis is not an impossible dream. These goals are all within our reach.\r\n\r\nIn times past, our forefathers had the vision but not the means to achieve\r\nsuch goals.\r\n\r\nLet it not be recorded that we were the first American generation that had\r\nthe means but not the vision to make this dream come true.\r\n\r\nBut let us, above all, recognize a fundamental truth. We can be the best\r\nclothed, best fed, best housed people in the world, enjoying clean air,\r\nclean water, beautiful parks, but we could still be the unhappiest people\r\nin the world without an indefinable spirit--the lift of a driving dream\r\nwhich has made America, from its beginning, the hope of the world.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred years ago this was a new nation of 3 million people, weak\r\nmilitarily, poor economically. But America meant something to the world\r\nthen which could not be measured in dollars, something far more important\r\nthan military might.\r\n\r\nListen to President Thomas Jefferson in 1802: We act not \"for ourselves\r\nalone, but for the whole human race.\"\r\n\r\nWe had a spiritual quality then which caught the imagination of millions of\r\npeople in the world.\r\n\r\nToday, when we are the richest and strongest nation in the world, let it\r\nnot be recorded that we lack the moral and spiritual idealism which made us\r\nthe hope of the world at the time of our birth.\r\n\r\nThe demands of us in 1976 are even greater than in 1776.\r\n\r\nIt is no longer enough to live and let live. Now we must live and help\r\nlive.\r\n\r\nWe need a fresh climate in America, one in which a person can breathe\r\nfreely and breathe in freedom.\r\n\r\nOur recognition of the truth that wealth and happiness are not the same\r\nthing requires us to measure success or failure by new criteria.\r\n\r\nEven more than the programs I have described today, what this Nation needs\r\nis an example from its elected leaders in providing the spiritual and moral\r\nleadership which no programs for material progress can satisfy.\r\n\r\nAbove all, let us inspire young Americans with a sense of excitement, a\r\nsense of destiny, a sense of involvement, in meeting the challenges we face\r\nin this great period of our history. Only then are they going to have any\r\nsense of satisfaction in their lives.\r\n\r\nThe greatest privilege an individual can have is to serve in a cause bigger\r\nthan himself. We have such a cause.\r\n\r\nHow we seize the opportunities I have described today will determine not\r\nonly our future, but the future of peace and freedom in this world in the\r\nlast third of the century.\r\n\r\nMay God give us the wisdom, the strength and, above all, the idealism to be\r\nworthy of that challenge, so that America can fulfill its destiny of being\r\nthe world's best hope for liberty, for opportunity, for progress and peace\r\nfor all peoples.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nRichard Nixon\r\nJanuary 22, 1971\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, Mr. President, my colleagues in the Congress, our\r\ndistinguished guests, my fellow Americans:\r\n\r\nAs this 92d Congress begins its session, America has lost a great Senator,\r\nand all of us who had the privilege to know him have lost a loyal friend. I\r\nhad the privilege of visiting Senator Russell in the hospital just a few\r\ndays before he died. He never spoke about himself. He only spoke eloquently\r\nabout the need for a strong national defense. In tribute to one of the most\r\nmagnificent Americans of all time, I respectfully ask that all those here\r\nwill rise in silent prayer for Senator Russell.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, before I begin my formal address, I want to use this\r\nopportunity to congratulate all of those who were winners in the rather\r\nspirited contest for leadership positions in the House and the Senate and,\r\nalso, to express my condolences to the losers. I know how both of you\r\nfeel.\r\n\r\nAnd I particularly want to join with all of the Members of the House and\r\nthe Senate as well in congratulating the new Speaker of the United States\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nTo those new Members of this House who may have some doubts about the\r\npossibilities for advancement in the years ahead, I would remind you that\r\nthe Speaker and I met just 24 years ago in this Chamber as freshmen Members\r\nof the 80th Congress. As you see, we both have come up in the world a bit\r\nsince then.\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, this 92d Congress has a chance to be recorded as the greatest\r\nCongress in America's history.\r\n\r\nIn these troubled years just past, America has been going through a long\r\nnightmare of war and division, of crime and inflation. Even more deeply, we\r\nhave gone through a long, dark night of the American spirit. But now that\r\nnight is ending. Now we must let our spirits soar again. Now we are ready\r\nfor the lift of a driving dream.\r\n\r\nThe people of this Nation are eager to get on with the quest for new\r\ngreatness. They see challenges, and they are prepared to meet those\r\nchallenges. It is for us here to open the doors that will set free again\r\nthe real greatness of this Nation--the genius of the American people.\r\n\r\nHow shall we meet this challenge? How can we truly open the doors, and set\r\nfree the full genius of our people?\r\n\r\nThe way in which the 92d Congress answers these questions will determine\r\nits place in history. More importantly, it can determine this Nation's\r\nplace in history as we enter the third century of our independence.\r\n\r\nTonight I shall present to the Congress six great goals. I shall ask not\r\nsimply for more new programs in the old framework. I shall ask to change\r\nthe framework of government itself---to reform the entire structure of\r\nAmerican government so we can make it again fully responsive to the needs\r\nand the wishes of the American people.\r\n\r\nIf we act boldly--if we seize this moment and achieve these goals--we can\r\nclose the gap between promise and performance in American government. We\r\ncan bring together the resources of this Nation and the spirit of the\r\nAmerican people.\r\n\r\nIn discussing these great goals, I shall deal tonight only with matters on\r\nthe domestic side of the Nation's agenda. I shall make a separate report to\r\nthe Congress and the Nation next month on developments in foreign policy.\r\n\r\nThe first of these great goals is already before the Congress.\r\n\r\nI urge that the unfinished business of the 91st Congress be made the first\r\npriority business of the 92d Congress.\r\n\r\nOver the next 2 weeks, I will call upon Congress to take action on more\r\nthan 35 pieces of proposed legislation on which action was not completed\r\nlast year.\r\n\r\nThe most important is welfare reform.\r\n\r\nThe present welfare system has become a monstrous, consuming outrage--an\r\noutrage against the community, against the taxpayer, and particularly\r\nagainst the children it is supposed to help.\r\n\r\nWe may honestly disagree, as we do, on what to do about it. But we can all\r\nagree that we must meet the challenge, not by pouring more money into a bad\r\nprogram, but by abolishing the present welfare system and adopting a new\r\none.\r\n\r\nSo let us place a floor under the income of every family with children in\r\nAmerica--and without those demeaning, soul-stifling affronts to human\r\ndignity that so blight the lives of welfare children today. But let us also\r\nestablish an effective work incentive and an effective work requirement.\r\n\r\nLet us provide the means by which more can help themselves. This shall be\r\nour goal.\r\n\r\nLet us generously help those who are not able to help themselves. But let\r\nus stop helping those who are able to help themselves but refuse to do so.\r\n\r\nThe second great goal is to achieve what Americans have not enjoyed since\r\n1957--full prosperity in peacetime.\r\n\r\nThe tide of inflation has turned. The rise in the cost of living, which had\r\nbeen gathering dangerous momentum in the late sixties, was reduced last\r\nyear. Inflation will be further reduced this year.\r\n\r\nBut as we have moved from runaway inflation toward reasonable price\r\nstability and at the same time as we have been moving from a wartime\r\neconomy to a peacetime economy, we have paid a price in increased\r\nunemployment.\r\n\r\nWe should take no comfort from the fact that the level of unemployment in\r\nthis transition from a wartime to a peacetime economy is lower than in any\r\npeacetime year of the sixties.\r\n\r\nThis is not good enough for the man who is unemployed in the seventies. We\r\nmust do better for workers in peacetime and we will do better.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, I will submit an expansionary budget this year--one that\r\nwill help stimulate the economy and thereby open up new job opportunities\r\nfor millions of Americans.\r\n\r\nIt will be a full employment budget, a budget designed to be in balance if\r\nthe economy were operating at its peak potential. By spending as if we were\r\nat full employment, we will help to bring about full employment.\r\n\r\nI ask the Congress to accept these expansionary policies--to accept the\r\nconcept of a full employment budget. At the same time, I ask the Congress\r\nto cooperate in resisting expenditures that go beyond the limits of the\r\nfull employment budget. For as we wage a campaign to bring about a widely\r\nshared prosperity, we must not reignite the fires of inflation and so\r\nundermine that prosperity.\r\n\r\nWith the stimulus and the discipline of a full employment budget, with the\r\ncommitment of the independent Federal Reserve System to provide fully for\r\nthe monetary needs of a growing economy, and with a much greater effort on\r\nthe part of labor and management to make their wage and price decisions in\r\nthe light of the national interest and their own self-interest--then for\r\nthe worker, the farmer, the consumer, for Americans everywhere we shall\r\ngain the goal of a new prosperity: more jobs, more income, more profits,\r\nwithout inflation and without war.\r\n\r\nThis is a great goal, and one that we can achieve together.\r\n\r\nThe third great goal is to continue the effort so dramatically begun last\r\nyear: to restore and enhance our natural environment.\r\n\r\nBuilding on the foundation laid in the 37-point program that I submitted to\r\nCongress last year, I will propose a strong new set of initiatives to clean\r\nup our air and water, to combat noise, and to preserve and restore our\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\nI will propose programs to make better use of our land, to encourage a\r\nbalanced national growth--growth that will revitalize our rural heartland\r\nand enhance the quality of life in America.\r\n\r\nAnd not only to meet today's needs but to anticipate those of tomorrow, I\r\nwill put forward the most extensive program ever proposed by a President of\r\nthe United States to expand the Nation's parks, recreation areas, open\r\nspaces, in a way that truly brings parks to the people where the people\r\nare. For only if we leave a legacy of parks will the next generation have\r\nparks to enjoy.\r\n\r\nAs a fourth great goal, I will offer a far-reaching set of proposals for\r\nimproving America's health care and making it available more fairly to more\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nI will propose:\r\n\r\n--A program to insure that no American family will be prevented from\r\nobtaining basic medical care by inability to pay.\r\n\r\n--I will propose a major increase in and redirection of aid to medical\r\nschools, to greatly increase the number of doctors and other health\r\npersonnel.\r\n\r\n--Incentives to improve the delivery of health services, to get more\r\nmedical care resources into those areas that have not been adequately\r\nserved, to make greater use of medical assistants, and to slow the alarming\r\nrise in the costs of medical care.\r\n\r\n--New programs to encourage better preventive medicine, by attacking the\r\ncauses of disease and injury, and by providing incentives to doctors to\r\nkeep people well rather than just to treat them when they are sick.\r\n\r\nI will also ask for an appropriation of an extra $100 million to launch an\r\nintensive campaign to find a cure for cancer, and I will ask later for\r\nwhatever additional funds can effectively be used. The time has come in\r\nAmerica when the same kind of concentrated effort that split the atom and\r\ntook man to the moon should be turned toward conquering this dread disease.\r\nLet us make a total national commitment to achieve this goal.\r\n\r\nAmerica has long been the wealthiest nation in the world. Now it is time we\r\nbecame the healthiest nation in the world.\r\n\r\nThe fifth great goal is to strengthen and to renew our State and local\r\ngovernments.\r\n\r\nAs we approach our 200th anniversary in 1976, we remember that this Nation\r\nlaunched itself as a loose confederation of separate States, without a\r\nworkable central government. At that time, the mark of its leaders' vision\r\nwas that they quickly saw the need to balance the separate powers of the\r\nStates with a government of central powers.\r\n\r\nAnd so they gave us a constitution of balanced powers, of unity with\r\ndiversity--and so clear was their vision that it survives today as the\r\noldest written constitution still in force in the world.\r\n\r\nFor almost two centuries since--and dramatically in the 1930's--at those\r\ngreat turning points when the question has been between the States and the\r\nFederal Government, that question has been resolved in favor of a stronger\r\ncentral Federal Government.\r\n\r\nDuring this time the Nation grew and the Nation prospered. But one thing\r\nhistory tells us is that no great movement goes in the same direction\r\nforever. Nations change, they adapt, or they slowly die.\r\n\r\nThe time has now come in America to reverse the flow of power and resources\r\nfrom the States and communities to Washington, and start power and\r\nresources flowing back from Washington to the States and communities and,\r\nmore important, to the people all across America.\r\n\r\nThe time has come for a new partnership between the Federal Government and\r\nthe States and localities--a partnership in which we entrust the States and\r\nlocalities with a larger share of the Nation's responsibilities, and in\r\nwhich we share our Federal revenues with them so that they can meet those\r\nresponsibilities.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this goal, I propose to the Congress tonight that we enact a\r\nplan of revenue sharing historic in scope and bold in concept.\r\n\r\nAll across America today, States and cities are confronted with a financial\r\ncrisis. Some have already been cutting back on essential services---for\r\nexample, just recently San Diego and Cleveland cut back on trash\r\ncollections. Most are caught between the prospects of bankruptcy on the one\r\nhand and adding to an already crushing tax burden on the other.\r\n\r\nAs one indication of the rising costs of local government, I discovered the\r\nother day that my home town of Whittier, California--which has a population\r\nof 67,000--has a larger budget for 1971 than the entire Federal budget was\r\nin 1791.\r\n\r\nNow the time has come to take a new direction, and once again to introduce\r\na new and more creative balance to our approach to government.\r\n\r\nSo let us put the money where the needs are. And let us put the power to\r\nspend it where the people are.\r\n\r\nI propose that the Congress make a $16 billion investment in renewing\r\nState and local government. Five billion dollars of this will be in new and\r\nunrestricted funds to be used as the States and localities see fit. The\r\nother $11 billion will be provided by allocating $1 billion of new funds\r\nand converting one-third of the money going to the present narrow-purpose\r\naid programs into Federal revenue sharing funds for six broad purposes--for\r\nurban development, rural development, education, transportation, job\r\ntraining, and law enforcement--but with the States and localities making\r\ntheir own decisions on how it should be spent within each category.\r\n\r\nFor the next fiscal year, this would increase total Federal aid to the\r\nStates and localities more than 25 percent over the present level.\r\n\r\nThe revenue sharing proposals I send to the Congress will include the\r\nsafeguards against discrimination that accompany all other Federal funds\r\nallocated to the States. Neither the President nor the Congress nor the\r\nconscience of this Nation can permit money which comes from all the people\r\nto be used in a way which discriminates against some of the people.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Government will still have a large and vital role to play in\r\nachieving our national progress. Established functions that are clearly and\r\nessentially Federal in nature will still be performed by the Federal\r\nGovernment. New functions that need to be sponsored or performed by the\r\nFederal Government--such as those I have urged tonight in welfare and\r\nhealth--will be added to the Federal agenda. Whenever it makes the best\r\nsense for us to act as a whole nation, the Federal Government should and\r\nwill lead the way. But where States or local governments can better do what\r\nneeds to be done, let us see that they have the resources to do it there.\r\n\r\nUnder this plan, the Federal Government will provide the States and\r\nlocalities with more money and less interference--and by cutting down the\r\ninterference the same amount of money will go a lot further.\r\n\r\nLet us share our resources.\r\n\r\nLet us share them to rescue the States and localities from the brink of\r\nfinancial crisis.\r\n\r\nLet us share them to give homeowners and wage earners a chance to escape\r\nfrom ever-higher property taxes and sales taxes.\r\n\r\nLet us share our resources for two other reasons as well.\r\n\r\nThe first of these reasons has to do with government itself, and the second\r\nhas to do with each of us, with the individual.\r\n\r\nLet's face it. Most Americans today are simply fed up with government at\r\nall levels. They will not--and they should not--continue to tolerate the\r\ngap between promise and performance in government.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that we have made the Federal Government so strong it grows\r\nmuscle-bound and the States and localities so weak they approach\r\nimpotence.\r\n\r\nIf we put more power in more places, we can make government more creative\r\nin more places. That way we multiply the number of people with the ability\r\nto make things happen--and we can open the way to a new burst of creative\r\nenergy throughout America.\r\n\r\nThe final reason I urge this historic shift is much more personal, for each\r\nand for every one of us.\r\n\r\nAs everything seems to have grown bigger and more complex in America, as\r\nthe forces that shape our lives seem to have grown more distant and more\r\nimpersonal, a great feeling of frustration has crept across this land.\r\n\r\nWhether it is the workingman who feels neglected, the black man who feels\r\noppressed, or the mother concerned about her children, there has been a\r\ngrowing feeling that \"Things are in the saddle, and ride mankind.\"\r\n\r\nMillions of frustrated young Americans today are crying out--asking not\r\nwhat will government do for me, but what can I do, how can I contribute,\r\nhow can I matter?\r\n\r\nAnd so let us answer them. Let us say to them and let us say to all\r\nAmericans, \"We hear you. We will give you a chance. We are going to give\r\nyou a new chance to have more to say about the decisions that affect your\r\nfuture--a chance to participate in government--because we are going to\r\nprovide more centers of power where what you do can make a difference that\r\nyou can see and feel in your own life and the life of your whole\r\ncommunity.\"\r\n\r\nThe further away government is from people, the stronger government becomes\r\nand the weaker people become. And a nation with a strong government and a\r\nweak people is an empty shell.\r\n\r\nI reject the patronizing idea that government in Washington, D.C., is\r\ninevitably more wise, more honest, and more efficient than government at\r\nthe local or State level. The honesty and efficiency of government depends\r\non people. Government at all levels has good people and bad people. And the\r\nway to get more good people into government is to give them more\r\nopportunity to do good things.\r\n\r\nThe idea that a bureaucratic elite in Washington knows best what is best\r\nfor people everywhere and that you cannot trust local governments is really\r\na contention that you cannot trust people to govern themselves. This notion\r\nis completely foreign to the American experience. Local government is the\r\ngovernment closest to the people, it is most responsive to the individual\r\nperson. It is people's government in a far more intimate way than the\r\nGovernment in Washington can ever be.\r\n\r\nPeople came to America because they wanted to determine their own future\r\nrather than to live in a country where others determined their future for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWhat this change means is that once again in America we are placing our\r\ntrust in people.\r\n\r\nI have faith in people. I trust the judgment of people. Let us give the\r\npeople of America a chance, a bigger voice in deciding for themselves those\r\nquestions that so greatly affect their lives.\r\n\r\nThe sixth great goal is a complete reform of the Federal Government\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nBased on a long and intensive study with the aid of the best advice\r\nobtainable, I have concluded that a sweeping reorganization of the\r\nexecutive branch is needed if the Government is to keep up with the times\r\nand with the needs of the people.\r\n\r\nI propose, therefore, that we reduce the present 12 Cabinet Departments to\r\neight.\r\n\r\nI propose that the Departments of State, Treasury, Defense, and Justice\r\nremain, but that all the other departments be consolidated into four: Human\r\nResources, Community Development, Natural Resources, and Economic\r\nDevelopment.\r\n\r\nLet us look at what these would be:\r\n\r\n--First, a department dealing with the concerns of people--as individuals,\r\nas members of a family--a department focused on human needs.\r\n\r\n--Second, a department concerned with the community--rural communities and\r\nurban communities--and with all that it takes to make a community function\r\nas a community.\r\n\r\n--Third, a department concerned with our physical environment, with the\r\npreservation and balanced use of those great natural resources on which our\r\nNation depends.\r\n\r\n--And fourth, a department concerned with our prosperity--with our jobs,\r\nour businesses, and those many activities that keep our economy running\r\nsmoothly and well.\r\n\r\nUnder this plan, rather than dividing up our departments by narrow\r\nsubjects, we would organize them around the great purposes of government.\r\nRather than scattering responsibility by adding new levels of bureaucracy,\r\nwe would focus and concentrate the responsibility for getting problems\r\nsolved.\r\n\r\nWith these four departments, when we have a problem we will know where to\r\ngo--and the department will have the authority and the resources to do\r\nsomething about it.\r\n\r\nOver the years we have added departments and created agencies at the\r\nFederal level, each to serve a new constituency, to handle a particular\r\ntask--and these have grown and multiplied in what has become a hopeless\r\nconfusion of form and function.\r\n\r\nThe time has come to match our structure to our purposes---to look with a\r\nfresh eye, to organize the Government by conscious, comprehensive design to\r\nmeet the new needs of a new era.\r\n\r\nOne hundred years ago, Abraham Lincoln stood on a battlefield and spoke of\r\na \"government of the people, by the people, for the people.\" Too often\r\nsince then, we have become a nation of the Government, by the Government,\r\nfor the Government.\r\n\r\nBy enacting these reforms, we can renew that principle that Lincoln stated\r\nso simply and so well.\r\n\r\nBy giving everyone's voice a chance to be heard, we will have government\r\nthat truly is of the people.\r\n\r\nBy creating more centers of meaningful power, more places where decisions\r\nthat really count can be made, by giving more people a chance to do\r\nsomething, we can have government that truly is by the people.\r\n\r\nAnd by setting up a completely modern, functional system of government at\r\nthe national level, we in Washington will at last be able to provide\r\ngovernment that is truly for the people.\r\n\r\nI realize that what I am asking is that not only the executive branch in\r\nWashington but that even this Congress will have to change by giving up\r\nsome of its power.\r\n\r\nChange is hard. But without change there can be no progress. And for each\r\nof us the question then becomes, not \"Will change cause me inconvenience?\"\r\nbut \"Will change bring progress for America?\"\r\n\r\nGiving up power is hard. But I would urge all of you, as leaders of this\r\ncountry, to remember that the truly revered leaders in world history are\r\nthose who gave power to people, and not those who took it away.\r\n\r\nAs we consider these reforms we will be acting, not for the next 2 years or\r\nfor the next 10 years, but for the next 100 years.\r\n\r\nSo let us approach these six great goals with a sense not only of this\r\nmoment in history but also of history itself.\r\n\r\nLet us act with the willingness to work together and the vision and the\r\nboldness and the courage of those great Americans who met in Philadelphia\r\nalmost 190 years ago to write a constitution.\r\n\r\nLet us leave a heritage as they did--not just for our children but for\r\nmillions yet unborn--of a nation where every American will have a chance\r\nnot only to live in peace and to enjoy prosperity and opportunity but to\r\nparticipate in a system of government where he knows not only his votes but\r\nhis ideas count--a system of government which will provide the means for\r\nAmerica to reach heights of achievement undreamed of before.\r\n\r\nThose men who met at Philadelphia left a great heritage because they had a\r\nvision--not only of what the Nation was but of what it could become.\r\n\r\nAs I think of that vision, I recall that America was founded as the land of\r\nthe open door--as a haven for the oppressed, a land of opportunity, a place\r\nof refuge, of hope.\r\n\r\nWhen the first settlers opened the door of America three and a half\r\ncenturies ago, they came to escape persecution and to find opportunity--and\r\nthey left wide the door of welcome for others to follow.\r\n\r\nWhen the Thirteen Colonies declared their independence almost two centuries\r\nago, they opened the door to a new vision of liberty and of human\r\nfulfillment--not just for an elite but for all.\r\n\r\nTo the generations that followed, America's was the open door that beckoned\r\nmillions from the old world to the new in search of a better life, a freer\r\nlife, a fuller life, and in which, by their own decisions, they could shape\r\ntheir own destinies.\r\n\r\nFor the black American, the Indian, the Mexican-American, and for those\r\nothers in our land who have not had an equal chance, the Nation at last has\r\nbegun to confront the need to press open the door of full and equal\r\nopportunity, and of human dignity.\r\n\r\nFor all Americans, with these changes I have proposed tonight we can open\r\nthe door to a new era of opportunity. We can open the door to full and\r\neffective participation in the decisions that affect their lives. We can\r\nopen the door to a new partnership among governments at all levels, between\r\nthose governments and the people themselves. And by so doing, we can open\r\nwide the doors of human fulfillment for millions of people here in America\r\nnow and in the years to come.\r\n\r\nIn the next few weeks I will spell out in greater detail the way I propose\r\nthat we achieve these six great goals. I ask this Congress to be\r\nresponsive. If it is, then the 92d Congress, your Congress, our Congress,\r\nat the end of its term, will be able to look back on a record more splendid\r\nthan any in our history.\r\n\r\nThis can be the Congress that helped us end the longest war in the Nation's\r\nhistory, and end it in a way that will give us at last a genuine chance to\r\nenjoy what we have not had in this century: a full generation of peace.\r\n\r\nThis can be the Congress that helped achieve an expanding economy, with\r\nfull employment and without inflation--and without the deadly stimulus of\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nThis can be the Congress that reformed a welfare system that has robbed\r\nrecipients of their dignity and robbed States and cities of their\r\nresources.\r\n\r\nThis can be the Congress that pressed forward the rescue of our\r\nenvironment, and established for the next generation an enduring legacy of\r\nparks for the people.\r\n\r\nThis can be the Congress that launched a new era in American medicine, in\r\nwhich the quality of medical care was enhanced while the costs were made\r\nless burdensome.\r\n\r\nBut above all, what this Congress can be remembered for is opening the way\r\nto a new American revolution--a peaceful revolution in which power was\r\nturned back to the people--in which government at all levels was refreshed\r\nand renewed and made truly responsive. This can be a revolution as\r\nprofound, as far-reaching, as exciting as that first revolution almost 200\r\nyears ago--and it can mean that just 5 years from now America will enter\r\nits third century as a young nation new in spirit, with all the vigor and\r\nthe freshness with which it began its first century.\r\n\r\nMy colleagues in the Congress, these are great goals. They can make the\r\nsessions of this Congress a great moment for America. So let us pledge\r\ntogether to go forward together--by achieving these goals to give America\r\nthe foundation today for a new greatness tomorrow and in all the years to\r\ncome, and in so doing to make this the greatest Congress in the history of\r\nthis great and good country.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nRichard Nixon\r\nJanuary 20, 1972\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, Mr. President, my colleagues in the Congress, our\r\ndistinguished guests, my fellow Americans:\r\n\r\nTwenty-five years ago I sat here as a freshman Congressman--along with\r\nSpeaker Albert--and listened for the first time to the President address\r\nthe State of the Union.\r\n\r\nI shall never forget that moment. The Senate, the diplomatic corps, the\r\nSupreme Court, the Cabinet entered the Chamber, and then the President of\r\nthe United States. As all of you are aware, I had some differences with\r\nPresident Truman. He had some with me. But I remember that on that day--the\r\nday he addressed that joint session of the newly elected Republican 80th\r\nCongress, he spoke not as a partisan, but as President of all the\r\npeople--calling upon the Congress to put aside partisan considerations in\r\nthe national interest.\r\n\r\nThe Greek-Turkish aid program, the Marshall Plan, the great foreign policy\r\ninitiatives which have been responsible for avoiding a world war for over\r\n25 years were approved by the 80th Congress, by a bipartisan majority of\r\nwhich I was proud to be a part.\r\n\r\nNineteen hundred seventy-two is now before us. It holds precious time in\r\nwhich to accomplish good for the Nation. We must not waste it. I know the\r\npolitical pressures in this session of the Congress will be great. There\r\nare more candidates for the Presidency in this Chamber today than there\r\nprobably have been at any one time in the whole history of the Republic.\r\nAnd there is an honest difference of opinion, not only between the parties,\r\nbut within each party, on some foreign policy issues and on some domestic\r\npolicy issues.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are great national problems that are so vital that they\r\ntranscend partisanship. So let us have our debates. Let us have our honest\r\ndifferences. But let us join in keeping the national interest first. Let us\r\njoin in making sure that legislation the Nation needs does not become\r\nhostage to the political interests of any party or any person.\r\n\r\nThere is ample precedent, in this election year, for me to present you with\r\na huge list of new proposals, knowing full well that there would not be any\r\npossibility of your passing them if you worked night and day.\r\n\r\nI shall not do that.\r\n\r\nI have presented to the leaders of the Congress today a message of 15,000\r\nwords discussing in some detail where the Nation stands and setting forth\r\nspecific legislative items on which I have asked the Congress to act. Much\r\nof this is legislation which I proposed in 1969, in 1970, and also in the\r\nfirst session of this 92d Congress and on which I feel it is essential that\r\naction be completed this year.\r\n\r\nI am not presenting proposals which have attractive labels but no hope of\r\npassage. I am presenting only vital programs which are within the capacity\r\nof this Congress to enact, within the capacity of the budget to finance,\r\nand which I believe should be above partisanship--programs which deal with\r\nurgent priorities for the Nation, which should and must be the subject of\r\nbipartisan action by this Congress in the interests of the country in\r\n1972.\r\n\r\nWhen I took the oath of office on the steps of this building just 3 years\r\nago today, the Nation was ending one of the most tortured decades in its\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nThe 1960's were a time of great progress in many areas. But as we all know,\r\nthey were also times of great agony--the agonies of war, of inflation, of\r\nrapidly rising crime, of deteriorating titles, of hopes raised and\r\ndisappointed, and of anger and frustration that led finally to violence and\r\nto the worst civil disorder in a century.\r\n\r\nI recall these troubles not to point any fingers of blame. The Nation was\r\nso torn in those final years of the sixties that many in both parties\r\nquestioned whether America could be governed at all.\r\n\r\nThe Nation has made significant progress in these first years of the\r\nseventies:\r\n\r\nOur cities are no longer engulfed by civil disorders.\r\n\r\nOur colleges and universities have again become places of learning instead\r\nof battlegrounds.\r\n\r\nA beginning has been made in preserving and protecting our environment.\r\n\r\nThe rate of increase in crime has been slowed--and here in the District of\r\nColumbia, the one city where the Federal Government has direct\r\njurisdiction, serious crime in 1971 was actually reduced by 13 percent from\r\nthe year before.\r\n\r\nMost important, because of the beginnings that have been made, we can say\r\ntoday that this year 1972 can be the year in which America may make the\r\ngreatest progress in 25 years toward achieving our goal of being at peace\r\nwith all the nations of the world.\r\n\r\nAs our involvement in the war in Vietnam comes to an end, we must now go on\r\nto build a generation of peace.\r\n\r\nTo achieve that goal, we must first face realistically the need to maintain\r\nour defense.\r\n\r\nIn the past 3 years, we have reduced the burden of arms. For the first time\r\nin 20 years, spending on defense has been brought below spending on human\r\nresources.\r\n\r\nAs we look to the future, we find encouraging progress in our negotiations\r\nwith the Soviet Union on limitation of strategic arms. And looking further\r\ninto the future, we hope there can eventually be agreement on the mutual\r\nreduction of arms. But until there is such a mutual agreement, we must\r\nmaintain the strength necessary to deter war.\r\n\r\nAnd that is why, because of rising research and development costs, because\r\nof increases in military and civilian pay, because of the need to proceed\r\nwith new weapons systems, my budget for the coming fiscal year will provide\r\nfor an increase in defense spending.\r\n\r\nStrong military defenses are not the enemy of peace; they are the guardians\r\nof peace.\r\n\r\nThere could be no more misguided set of priorities than one which would\r\ntempt others by weakening America, and thereby endanger the peace of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nIn our foreign policy, we have entered a new era. The world has changed\r\ngreatly in the 11 years since President John Kennedy said in his Inaugural\r\nAddress, \"... we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship,\r\nsupport any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success\r\nof liberty.\"\r\n\r\nOur policy has been carefully and deliberately adjusted to meet the new\r\nrealities of the new world we live in. We make today only those commitments\r\nwe are able and prepared to meet.\r\n\r\nOur commitment to freedom remains strong and unshakable. But others must\r\nbear their share of the burden of defending freedom around the world.\r\n\r\nAnd so this, then, is our policy:\r\n\r\n--We will maintain a nuclear deterrent adequate to meet any threat to the\r\nsecurity of the United States or of our allies.\r\n\r\n--We will help other nations develop the capability of defending\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n--We will faithfully honor all of our treaty commitments.\r\n\r\n--We will act to defend our interests, whenever and wherever they are\r\nthreatened anyplace in the world.\r\n\r\n--But where our interests or our treaty commitments are not involved, our\r\nrole will be limited.\r\n\r\n--We will not intervene militarily.\r\n\r\n--But we will use our influence to prevent war.\r\n\r\n--If war comes, we will use our influence to stop it.\r\n\r\n--Once it is over, we will do our share in helping to bind up the wounds of\r\nthose who have participated in it.\r\n\r\nAs you know, I will soon be visiting the People's Republic of China and the\r\nSoviet Union. I go there with no illusions. We have great differences with\r\nboth powers. We shall continue to have great differences. But peace depends\r\non the ability of great powers to live together on the same planet despite\r\ntheir differences.\r\n\r\nWe would not be true to our obligation to generations yet unborn if we\r\nfailed to seize this moment to do everything in our power to insure that we\r\nwill be able to talk about those differences, rather than to fight about\r\nthem, in the future.\r\n\r\nAs we look back over this century, let us, in the highest spirit of\r\nbipartisanship, recognize that we can be proud of our Nation's record in\r\nforeign affairs.\r\n\r\nAmerica has given more generously of itself toward maintaining freedom,\r\npreserving peace, alleviating human suffering around the globe, than any\r\nnation has ever done in the history of man.\r\n\r\nWe have fought four wars in this century, but our power has never been used\r\nto break the peace, only to keep it; never been used to destroy freedom,\r\nonly to defend it. We now have within our reach the goal of insuring that\r\nthe next generation can be the first generation in this century to be\r\nspared the scourges of war.\r\n\r\nTurning to our problems at home, we are making progress toward our goal of\r\na new prosperity without war.\r\n\r\nIndustrial production, consumer spending, retail sales, personal income all\r\nhave been rising. Total employment, real income are the highest in history.\r\nNew home building starts this past year reached the highest level ever.\r\nBusiness and consumer confidence have both been rising. Interest rates are\r\ndown. The rate of inflation is down. We can look with confidence to 1972 as\r\nthe year when the back of inflation will be broken.\r\n\r\nNow, this a good record, but it is not good enough--not when we still have\r\nan unemployment rate of 6 percent.\r\n\r\nIt is not enough to point out that this was the rate of the early peacetime\r\nyears of the sixties, or that if the more than 2 million men released from\r\nthe Armed Forces and defense-related industries were still in their wartime\r\njobs, unemployment would be far lower.\r\n\r\nOur goal in this country is full employment in peacetime. We intend to meet\r\nthat goal, and we can.\r\n\r\nThe Congress has helped to meet that goal by passing our job-creating tax\r\nprogram last month.\r\n\r\nThe historic monetary agreements, agreements that we have reached with the\r\nmajor European nations, Canada, and Japan, will help meet it by providing\r\nnew markets for American products, new jobs for American workers.\r\n\r\nOur budget will help meet it by being expansionary without being\r\ninflationary--a job-producing budget that will help take up the gap as the\r\neconomy expands to full employment.\r\n\r\nOur program to raise farm income will help meet it by helping to revitalize\r\nrural America, by giving to America's farmers their fair share of America's\r\nincreasing productivity.\r\n\r\nWe also will help meet our goal of full employment in peacetime with a set\r\nof major initiatives to stimulate more imaginative use of America's great\r\ncapacity for technological advance, and to direct it toward improving the\r\nquality of life for every American.\r\n\r\nIn reaching the moon, we demonstrated what miracles American technology is\r\ncapable of achieving. Now the time has come to move more deliberately\r\ntoward making full use of that technology here on earth, of harnessing the\r\nwonders of science to the service of man.\r\n\r\nI shall soon send to the Congress a special message proposing a new program\r\nof Federal partnership in technological research and development--with\r\nFederal incentives to increase private research, federally supported\r\nresearch on projects designed to improve our everyday lives in ways that\r\nwill range from improving mass transit to developing new systems of\r\nemergency health care that could save thousands of lives annually.\r\n\r\nHistorically, our superior technology and high productivity have made it\r\npossible for American workers to be the highest paid in the world by far,\r\nand yet for our goods still to compete in world markets.\r\n\r\nNow we face a new situation. As other nations move rapidly forward in\r\ntechnology, the answer to the new competition is not to build a wall around\r\nAmerica, but rather to remain competitive by improving our own technology\r\nstill further and by increasing productivity in American industry.\r\n\r\nOur new monetary and trade agreements will make it possible for American\r\ngoods to compete fairly in the world's markets--but they still must\r\ncompete. The new technology program will put to use the skills of many\r\nhighly trained Americans, skills that might otherwise be wasted. It will\r\nalso meet the growing technological challenge from abroad, and it will thus\r\nhelp to create new industries, as well as creating more jobs for America's\r\nworkers in producing for the world's markets.\r\n\r\nThis second session of the 92d Congress already has before it more than 90\r\nmajor Administration proposals which still await action.\r\n\r\nI have discussed these in the extensive written message that I have\r\npresented to the Congress today.\r\n\r\nThey include, among others, our programs to improve life for the aging; to\r\ncombat crime and drug abuse; to improve health services and to ensure that\r\nno one will be denied needed health care because of inability to pay; to\r\nprotect workers' pension rights; to promote equal opportunity for members\r\nof minorities, and others who have been left behind; to expand consumer\r\nprotection; to improve the environment; to revitalize rural America; to\r\nhelp the cities; to launch new initiatives in education; to improve\r\ntransportation, and to put an end to costly labor tie-ups in\r\ntransportation.\r\n\r\nThe west coast dock strike is a case in point. This Nation cannot and will\r\nnot tolerate that kind of irresponsible labor tie-up in the future.\r\n\r\nThe messages also include basic reforms which are essential if our\r\nstructure of government is to be adequate in the decades ahead.\r\n\r\nThey include reform of our wasteful and outmoded welfare\r\nsystem--substitution of a new system that provides work requirements and\r\nwork incentives for those who can help themselves, income support for those\r\nwho cannot help themselves, and fairness to the working poor.\r\n\r\nThey include a $17 billion program of Federal revenue sharing with the\r\nStates and localities as an investment in their renewal, an investment also\r\nof faith in the American people.\r\n\r\nThey also include a sweeping reorganization of the executive branch of the\r\nFederal Government so that it will be more efficient, more responsive, and\r\nable to meet the challenges of the decades ahead.\r\n\r\nOne year ago, standing in this place, I laid before the opening session of\r\nthis Congress six great goals. One of these was welfare reform. That\r\nproposal has been before the Congress now for nearly 2 1/2 years.\r\n\r\nMy proposals on revenue sharing, government reorganization, health care,\r\nand the environment have now been before the Congress for nearly a year.\r\nMany of the other major proposals that I have referred to have been here\r\nthat long or longer.\r\n\r\nNow, 1971, we can say, was a year of consideration of these measures. Now\r\nlet us join in making 1972 a year of action on them, action by the\r\nCongress, for the Nation and for the people of America.\r\n\r\nNow, in addition, there is one pressing need which I have not previously\r\ncovered, but which must be placed on the national agenda.\r\n\r\nWe long have looked in this Nation to the local property tax as the main\r\nsource of financing for public primary and secondary education.\r\n\r\nAs a result, soaring school costs, soaring property tax rates now threaten\r\nboth our communities and our schools. They threaten communities because\r\nproperty taxes, which more than doubled in the 10 years from 1960 to '70,\r\nhave become one of the most oppressive and discriminatory of all taxes,\r\nhitting most cruelly at the elderly and the retired; and they threaten\r\nschools, as hard-pressed voters understandably reject new bond issues at\r\nthe polls.\r\n\r\nThe problem has been given even greater urgency by four recent court\r\ndecisions, which have held that the conventional method of financing\r\nschools through local property taxes is discriminatory and\r\nunconstitutional.\r\n\r\nNearly 2 years ago, I named a special Presidential commission to study the\r\nproblems of school finance, and I also directed the Federal departments to\r\nlook into the same problems. We are developing comprehensive proposals to\r\nmeet these problems.\r\n\r\nThis issue involves two complex and interrelated sets of problems: support\r\nof the schools and the basic relationships of Federal, State, and local\r\ngovernments in any tax reforms.\r\n\r\nUnder the leadership of the Secretary of the Treasury, we are carefully\r\nreviewing all of the tax aspects, and I have this week enlisted the\r\nAdvisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations in addressing the\r\nintergovernmental relations aspects.\r\n\r\nI have asked this bipartisan Commission to review our proposals for Federal\r\naction to cope with the gathering crisis of school finance and property\r\ntaxes. Later in the year, when both Commissions have completed their\r\nstudies, I shall make my final recommendations for relieving the burden of\r\nproperty taxes and providing both fair and adequate financing for our\r\nchildren's education.\r\n\r\nThese recommendations will be revolutionary. But all these recommendations,\r\nhowever, will be rooted in one fundamental principle with which there can\r\nbe no compromise: Local school boards must have control over local\r\nschools.\r\n\r\nAs we look ahead over the coming decades, vast new growth and change are\r\nnot only certainties, they will be the dominant reality of this world, and\r\nparticularly of our life in America.\r\n\r\nSurveying the certainty of rapid change, we can be like a fallen rider\r\ncaught in the stirrups--or we can sit high in the saddle, the masters of\r\nchange, directing it on a course we choose.\r\n\r\nThe secret of mastering change in today's world is to reach back to old and\r\nproven principles, and to adapt them with imagination and intelligence to\r\nthe new realities of a new age.\r\n\r\nThat is what we have done in the proposals that I have laid before the\r\nCongress. They are rooted in basic principles that are as enduring as human\r\nnature, as robust as the American experience; and they are responsive to\r\nnew conditions. Thus they represent a spirit of change that is truly\r\nrenewal.\r\n\r\nAs we look back at those old principles, we find them as timely as they are\r\ntimeless.\r\n\r\nWe believe in independence, and self-reliance, and the creative value of\r\nthe competitive spirit.\r\n\r\nWe believe in full and equal opportunity for all Americans and in the\r\nprotection of individual rights and liberties.\r\n\r\nWe believe in the family as the keystone of the community, and in the\r\ncommunity as the keystone of the Nation.\r\n\r\nWe believe in compassion toward those in need.\r\n\r\nWe believe in a system of law, justice, and order as the basis of a\r\ngenuinely free society.\r\n\r\nWe believe that a person should get what he works for--and that those who\r\ncan, should work for what they get.\r\n\r\nWe believe in the capacity of people to make their own decisions in their\r\nown lives, in their own communities--and we believe in their right to make\r\nthose decisions.\r\n\r\nIn applying these principles, we have done so with the full understanding\r\nthat what we seek in the seventies, what our quest is, is not merely for\r\nmore, but for better for a better quality of life for all Americans.\r\n\r\nThus, for example, we are giving a new measure of attention to cleaning up\r\nour air and water, making our surroundings more attractive. We are\r\nproviding broader support for the arts, helping stimulate a deeper\r\nappreciation of what they can contribute to the Nation's activities and to\r\nour individual lives.\r\n\r\nBut nothing really matters more to the quality of our lives than the way we\r\ntreat one another, than our capacity to live respectfully together as a\r\nunified society, with a full, generous regard for the rights of others and\r\nalso for the feelings of others.\r\n\r\nAs we recover from the turmoil and violence of recent years, as we learn\r\nonce again to speak with one another instead of shouting at one another, we\r\nare regaining that capacity.\r\n\r\nAs is customary here, on this occasion, I have been talking about programs.\r\nPrograms are important. But even more important than programs is what we\r\nare as a Nation--what we mean as a Nation, to ourselves and to the world.\r\n\r\nIn New York Harbor stands one of the most famous statues in the world--the\r\nStatue of Liberty, the gift in 1886 of the people of France to the people\r\nof the United States. This statue is more than a landmark; it is a\r\nsymbol--a symbol of what America has meant to the world.\r\n\r\nIt reminds us that what America has meant is not its wealth, and not its\r\npower, but its spirit and purpose--a land that enshrines liberty and\r\nopportunity, and that has held out a hand of welcome to millions in search\r\nof a better and a fuller and, above all, a freer life.\r\n\r\nThe world's hopes poured into America, along with its people. And those\r\nhopes, those dreams, that have been brought here from every corner of the\r\nworld, have become a part of the hope that we now hold out to the world.\r\n\r\nFour years from now, America will celebrate the 200th anniversary of its\r\nfounding as a Nation. There are those who say that the old Spirit of '76 is\r\ndead--that we no longer have the strength of character, the idealism, the\r\nfaith in our founding purposes that that spirit represents.\r\n\r\nThose who say this do not know America.\r\n\r\nWe have been undergoing self-doubts and self-criticism. But these are only\r\nthe other side of our growing sensitivity to the persistence of want in the\r\nmidst of plenty, of our impatience with the slowness with which age-old\r\nills are being overcome.\r\n\r\nIf we were indifferent to the shortcomings of our society, or complacent\r\nabout our institutions, or blind to the lingering inequities--then we would\r\nhave lost our way.\r\n\r\nBut the fact that we have those concerns is evidence that our ideals, deep\r\ndown, are still strong. Indeed, they remind us that what is really best\r\nabout America is its compassion. They remind us that in the final analysis,\r\nAmerica is great not because it is strong, not because it is rich, but\r\nbecause this is a good country.\r\n\r\nLet us reject the narrow visions of those who would tell us that we are\r\nevil because we are not yet perfect, that we are corrupt because we are not\r\nyet pure, that all the sweat and toil and sacrifice that have gone into the\r\nbuilding of America were for naught because the building is not yet done.\r\n\r\nLet us see that the path we are traveling is wide, with room in it for all\r\nof us, and that its direction is toward a better Nation and a more peaceful\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nNever has it mattered more that we go forward together.\r\n\r\nLook at this Chamber. The leadership of America is here today--the Supreme\r\nCourt, the Cabinet, the Senate, the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nTogether, we hold the future of the Nation, and the conscience of the\r\nNation in our hands.\r\n\r\nBecause this year is an election year, it will be a time of great\r\npressure.\r\n\r\nIf we yield to that pressure and fail to deal seriously with the historic\r\nchallenges that we face, we will have failed the trust of millions of\r\nAmericans and shaken the confidence they have a right to place in us, in\r\ntheir Government.\r\n\r\nNever has a Congress had a greater opportunity to leave a legacy of a\r\nprofound and constructive reform for the Nation than this Congress.\r\n\r\nIf we succeed in these tasks, there will be credit enough for all--not only\r\nfor doing what is right, but doing it in the right way, by rising above\r\npartisan interest to serve the national interest.\r\n\r\nAnd if we fail, more than any one of us, America will be the loser.\r\n\r\nThat is why my call upon the Congress today is for a high statesmanship, so\r\nthat in the years to come Americans will look back and say because it\r\nwithstood the intense pressures of a political year, and achieved such\r\ngreat good for the American people and for the future of this Nation, this\r\nwas truly a great Congress.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nRichard Nixon\r\nFebruary 2, 1973\r\n\r\nTo the Congress of the United States:\r\n\r\nThe traditional form of the President's annual report giving \"to the\r\nCongress Information of the State of the Union\" is a single message or\r\naddress. As the affairs and concerns of our Union have multiplied over the\r\nyears, however, so too have the subjects that require discussion in State\r\nof the Union Messages.\r\n\r\nThis year in particular, with so many changes in Government programs under\r\nconsideration--and with our very philosophy about the relationship between\r\nthe individual and the State at an historic crossroads--a single,\r\nall-embracing State of the Union Message would not appear to be adequate.\r\n\r\nI have therefore decided to present my 1973 State of the Union report in\r\nthe form of a series of messages during these early weeks of the 93rd\r\nCongress. The purpose of this first message in the series is to give a\r\nconcise overview of where we stand as a people today, and to outline some\r\nof the general goals that I believe we should pursue over the next year and\r\nbeyond. In coming weeks, I will send to the Congress further State of the\r\nUnion reports on specific areas of policy including economic affairs,\r\nnatural resources, human resources, community development and foreign and\r\ndefense policy.\r\n\r\nThe new course these messages will outline represents a fresh approach to\r\nGovernment: an approach that addresses the realities of the 1970s, not\r\nthose of the 1930s or of the 1960s. The role of the Federal Government as\r\nwe approach our third century of independence should not be to dominate any\r\nfacet of American life, but rather to aid and encourage people, communities\r\nand institutions to deal with as many of the difficulties and challenges\r\nfacing them as possible, and to help see to it that every American has a\r\nfull and equal opportunity to realize his or her potential.\r\n\r\nIf we were to continue to expand the Federal Government at the rate of the\r\npast several decades, it soon would consume us entirely. The time has come\r\nwhen we must make clear choices--choices between old programs that set\r\nworthy goals but failed to reach them and new programs that provide a\r\nbetter way to realize those goals; and choices, too, between competing\r\nprograms--all of which may be desirable in themselves but only some of\r\nwhich we can afford with the finite resources at our command.\r\n\r\nBecause our resources are not infinite, we also face a critical choice in\r\n1973 between holding the line in Government spending and adopting expensive\r\nprograms which will surely force up taxes and refuel inflation.\r\n\r\nFinally, it is vital at this time that we restore a greater sense of\r\nresponsibility at the State and local level, and among individual\r\nAmericans.\r\n\r\nWHERE WE STAND\r\n\r\nThe basic state of our Union today is sound, and full of promise.\r\n\r\nWe enter 1973 economically strong, militarily secure and, most important of\r\nall, at peace after a long and trying war.\r\n\r\nAmerica continues to provide a better and more abundant life for more of\r\nits people than any other nation in the world. We have passed through one\r\nof the most difficult periods in our history without surrendering to\r\ndespair and without dishonoring our ideals as a people.\r\n\r\nLooking back, there is a lesson in all this for all of us. The lesson is\r\none that we sometimes had to learn the hard way over the past few years.\r\nBut we did learn it. That lesson is that even potentially destructive\r\nforces can be converted into positive forces when we know how to channel\r\nthem, and when we use common sense and common decency to create a climate\r\nof mutual respect and goodwill.\r\n\r\nBy working together and harnessing the forces of nature, Americans have\r\nunlocked some of the great mysteries of the universe.\r\n\r\nMen have walked the surface of the moon and soared to new heights of\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\nThis same spirit of discovery is helping us to conquer disease and\r\nsuffering that have plagued our own planet since the dawn of time.\r\n\r\nBy working together with the leaders of other nations, we have been able to\r\nbuild a new hope for lasting peace--for a structure of world order in which\r\ncommon interest outweighs old animosities, and in which a new generation of\r\nthe human family can grow up at peace in a changing world.\r\n\r\nAt home, we have learned that by working together we can create prosperity\r\nwithout fanning inflation; we can restore order without weakening freedom.\r\n\r\nTHE CHALLENGES WE FACE\r\n\r\nThese first years of the 1970s have been good years for America.\r\n\r\nOur job--all of us together--is to make 1973 and the years to come even\r\nbetter ones. I believe that we can. I believe that we can make the years\r\nleading to our Bicentennial the best four years in American history.\r\n\r\nBut we must never forget that nothing worthwhile can be achieved without\r\nthe will to succeed and the strength to sacrifice.\r\n\r\nHard decisions must be made, and we must stick by them.\r\n\r\nIn the field of foreign policy, we must remember that a strong America--an\r\nAmerica whose word is believed and whose strength is respected--is\r\nessential to continued peace and understanding in the world. The peace with\r\nhonor we have achieved in Vietnam has strengthened this basic American\r\ncredibility. We must act in such a way in coming years that this\r\ncredibility will remain intact, and with it, the world stability of which\r\nit is so indispensable a part.\r\n\r\nAt home, we must reject the mistaken notion--a notion that has dominated\r\ntoo much of the public dialogue for too long--that ever bigger Government\r\nis the answer to every problem.\r\n\r\nWe have learned only too well that heavy taxation and excessive Government\r\nspending are not a cure-all. In too many cases, instead of solving the\r\nproblems they were aimed at, they have merely placed an ever heavier burden\r\non the shoulders of the American taxpayer, in the form of higher taxes and\r\na higher cost of living. At the same time they have deceived our people\r\nbecause many of the intended beneficiaries received far less than was\r\npromised, thus undermining public faith in the effectiveness of Government\r\nas a whole.\r\n\r\nThe time has come for us to draw the line. The time has come for the\r\nresponsible leaders of both political parties to take a stand against\r\novergrown Government and for the American taxpayer. We are not spending the\r\nFederal Government's money, we are spending the taxpayer's money, and it\r\nmust be spent in a way which guarantees his money's worth and yields the\r\nfullest possible benefit to the people being helped.\r\n\r\nThe answer to many of the domestic problems we face is not higher taxes and\r\nmore spending. It is less waste, more results and greater freedom for the\r\nindividual American to earn a rightful place in his own community--and for\r\nStates and localities to address their own needs in their own ways, in the\r\nlight of their own priorities.\r\n\r\nBy giving the people and their locally elected leaders a greater voice\r\nthrough changes such as revenue sharing, and by saying \"no\" to excessive\r\nFederal spending and higher taxes, we can help achieve this goal.\r\n\r\nCOMING MESSAGES\r\n\r\nThe policies which I will outline to the Congress in the weeks ahead\r\nrepresent a reaffirmation, not an abdication, of Federal responsibility.\r\nThey represent a pragmatic rededication to social compassion and national\r\nexcellence, in place of the combination of good intentions and fuzzy\r\nfollow-through which too often in the past was thought sufficient.\r\n\r\nIn the field of economic affairs, our objectives will be to hold down\r\ntaxes, to continue controlling inflation, to promote economic growth, to\r\nincrease productivity, to encourage foreign trade, to keep farm income\r\nhigh, to bolster small business, and to promote better labor-management\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\nIn the area of natural resources, my recommendations will include programs\r\nto preserve and enhance the environment, to advance science and technology,\r\nand to assure balanced use of our irreplaceable natural resources.\r\n\r\nIn developing human resources, I will have recommendations to advance the\r\nNation's health and education, to improve conditions of people in need, to\r\ncarry forward our increasingly successful attacks on crime, drug abuse and\r\ninjustice, and to deal with such important areas of special concern as\r\nconsumer affairs. We will continue and improve our Nation's efforts to\r\nassist those who have served in the Armed Services in Vietnam through\r\nbetter job and training opportunities.\r\n\r\nWe must do a better job in community development--in creating more livable\r\ncommunities, in which all of our children can grow up with fuller access to\r\nopportunity and greater immunity to the social evils and blights which now\r\nplague so many of our towns and cities. I shall have proposals to help us\r\nachieve this.\r\n\r\nI shall also deal with our defense and foreign policies, and with our new\r\napproaches to the role and structure of Government itself.\r\n\r\nConsidered as a whole, this series of messages will be a blueprint for\r\nmodernizing the concept and the functions of American Government to meet\r\nthe needs of our people.\r\n\r\nConverting it into reality will require a spirit of cooperation and shared\r\ncommitment on the part of all branches of the Government, for the goals we\r\nseek are not those of any single party or faction, they are goals for the\r\nbetterment of all Americans. As President, I recognize that I cannot do\r\nthis job alone. The Congress must help, and I pledge to do my part to\r\nachieve a constructive working relationship with the Congress. My sincere\r\nhope is that the executive and legislative branches can work together in\r\nthis great undertaking in a positive spirit of mutual respect and\r\ncooperation.\r\n\r\nWorking together--the Congress, the President and the people--I am\r\nconfident that we can translate these proposals into an action program that\r\ncan reform and revitalize American Government and, even more important,\r\nbuild a better life for all Americans.\r\n\r\nThe White House,\r\n\r\nFebruary 2, 1973.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nRichard Nixon\r\nJanuary 30, 1974\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, Mr. President, my colleagues in the Congress, our\r\ndistinguished guests, my fellow Americans:\r\n\r\nWe meet here tonight at a time of great challenge and great opportunities\r\nfor America. We meet at a time when we face great problems at home and\r\nabroad that will test the strength of our fiber as a nation. But we also\r\nmeet at a time when that fiber has been tested, and it has proved strong.\r\n\r\nAmerica is a great and good land, and we are a great and good land because\r\nwe are a strong, free, creative people and because America is the single\r\ngreatest force for peace anywhere in the world. Today, as always in our\r\nhistory, we can base our confidence in what the American people will\r\nachieve in the future on the record of what the American people have\r\nachieved in the past.\r\n\r\nTonight, for the first time in 12 years, a President of the United States\r\ncan report to the Congress on the state of a Union at peace with every\r\nnation of the world. Because of this, in the 22,000-word message on the\r\nstate of the Union that I have just handed to the Speaker of the House and\r\nthe President of the Senate, I have been able to deal primarily with the\r\nproblems of peace with what we can do here at home in America for the\r\nAmerican people--rather than with the problems of war.\r\n\r\nThe measures I have outlined in this message set an agenda for truly\r\nsignificant progress for this Nation and the world in 1974. Before we chart\r\nwhere we are going, let us see how far we have come.\r\n\r\nIt was 5 years ago on the steps of this Capitol that I took the oath of\r\noffice as your President. In those 5 years, because of the initiatives\r\nundertaken by this Administration, the world has changed. America has\r\nchanged. As a result of those changes, America is safer today, more\r\nprosperous today, with greater opportunity for more of its people than ever\r\nbefore in our history.\r\n\r\nFive years ago, America was at war in Southeast Asia. We were locked in\r\nconfrontation with the Soviet Union. We were in hostile isolation from a\r\nquarter of the world's people who lived in Mainland China.\r\n\r\nFive years ago, our cities were burning and besieged.\r\n\r\nFive years ago, our college campuses were a battleground.\r\n\r\nFive years ago, crime was increasing at a rate that struck fear across the\r\nNation.\r\n\r\nFive years ago, the spiraling rise in drug addiction was threatening human\r\nand social tragedy of massive proportion, and there was no program to deal\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nFive years ago--as young Americans had done for a generation before\r\nthat--America's youth still lived under the shadow of the military draft.\r\n\r\nFive years ago, there was no national program to preserve our environment.\r\nDay by day, our air was getting dirtier, our water was getting more foul.\r\n\r\nAnd 5 years ago, American agriculture was practically a depressed industry\r\nwith 100,000 farm families abandoning the farm every year.\r\n\r\nAs we look at America today, we find ourselves challenged by new problems.\r\nBut we also find a record of progress to confound the professional criers\r\nof doom and prophets of despair. We met the challenges we faced 5 years\r\nago, and we will be equally confident of meeting those that we face today.\r\n\r\nLet us see for a moment how we have met them.\r\n\r\nAfter more than 10 years of military involvement, all of our troops have\r\nreturned from Southeast Asia, and they have returned with honor. And we can\r\nbe proud of the fact that our courageous prisoners of war, for whom a\r\ndinner was held in Washington tonight, that they came home with their heads\r\nhigh, on their feet and not on their knees.\r\n\r\nIn our relations with the Soviet Union, we have turned away from a policy\r\nof confrontation to one of negotiation. For the first time since World War\r\nII, the world's two strongest powers are working together toward peace in\r\nthe world. With the People's Republic of China after a generation of\r\nhostile isolation, we have begun a period of peaceful exchange and\r\nexpanding trade.\r\n\r\nPeace has returned to our cities, to our campuses. The 17-year rise in\r\ncrime has been stopped. We can confidently say today that we are finally\r\nbeginning to win the war against crime. Right here in this Nation's\r\nCapital--which a few years ago was threatening to become the crime capital\r\nof the world--the rate in crime has been cut in half. A massive campaign\r\nagainst drug abuse has been organized. And the rate of new heroin\r\naddiction, the most vicious threat of all, is decreasing rather than\r\nincreasing.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in a generation, no young Americans are being drafted\r\ninto the armed services of the United States. And for the first time ever,\r\nwe have organized a massive national effort to protect the environment. Our\r\nair is getting cleaner, our water is getting purer, and our agriculture,\r\nwhich was depressed, is prospering. Farm income is up 70 percent, farm\r\nproduction is setting all-time records, and the billions of dollars the\r\ntaxpayers were paying in subsidies has been cut to nearly zero.\r\n\r\nOverall, Americans are living more abundantly than ever before, today. More\r\nthan 2 1/2 million new jobs were created in the past year alone. That is\r\nthe biggest percentage increase in nearly 20 years. People are earning\r\nmore. What they earn buys more, more than ever before in history. In the\r\npast 5 years, the average American's real spendable income--that is, what\r\nyou really can buy with your income, even after allowing for taxes and\r\ninflation--has increased by 16 percent.\r\n\r\nDespite this record of achievement, as we turn to the year ahead we hear\r\nonce again the familiar voice of the perennial prophets of gloom telling us\r\nnow that because of the need to fight inflation, because of the energy\r\nshortage, America may be headed for a recession.\r\n\r\nLet me speak to that issue head on. There will be no recession in the\r\nUnited States of America. Primarily due to our energy crisis, our economy\r\nis passing through a difficult period. But I pledge to you tonight that the\r\nfull powers of this Government will be used to keep America's economy\r\nproducing and to protect the jobs of America's workers.\r\n\r\nWe are engaged in a long and hard fight against inflation. There have been,\r\nand there will be in the future, ups and downs in that fight. But if this\r\nCongress cooperates in our efforts to hold down the cost of Government, we\r\nshall win our fight to hold down the cost of living for the American\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nAs we look back over our history, the years that stand out as the ones of\r\nsignal achievement are those in which the Administration and the Congress,\r\nwhether one party or the other, working together, had the wisdom and the\r\nforesight to select those particular initiatives for which the Nation was\r\nready and the moment was right--and in which they seized the moment and\r\nacted.\r\n\r\nLooking at the year 1974 which lies before us, there are 10 key areas in\r\nwhich landmark accomplishments are possible this year in America. If we\r\nmake these our national agenda, this is what we will achieve in 1974:\r\n\r\nWe will break the back of the energy crisis; we will lay the foundation for\r\nour future capacity to meet America's energy needs from America's own\r\nresources.\r\n\r\nAnd we will take another giant stride toward lasting peace in the\r\nworld--not only by continuing our policy of negotiation rather than\r\nconfrontation where the great powers are concerned but also by helping\r\ntoward the achievement of a just and lasting settlement in the Middle\r\nEast.\r\n\r\nWe will check the rise in prices without administering the harsh medicine\r\nof recession, and we will move the economy into a steady period of growth\r\nat a sustainable level.\r\n\r\nWe will establish a new system that makes high-quality health care\r\navailable to every American in a dignified manner and at a price he can\r\nafford.\r\n\r\nWe will make our States and localities more responsive to the needs of\r\ntheir own citizens.\r\n\r\nWe will make a crucial breakthrough toward better transportation in our\r\ntowns and in our cities across America.\r\n\r\nWe will reform our system of Federal aid to education, to provide it when\r\nit is needed, where it is needed, so that it will do the most for those who\r\nneed it the most.\r\n\r\nWe will make an historic beginning on the task of defining and protecting\r\nthe right of personal privacy for every American.\r\n\r\nAnd we will start on a new road toward reform of a welfare system that\r\nbleeds the taxpayer, corrodes the community, and demeans those it is\r\nintended to assist.\r\n\r\nAnd together with the other nations of the world, we will establish the\r\neconomic framework within which Americans will share more fully in an\r\nexpanding worldwide trade and prosperity in the years ahead, with more open\r\naccess to both markets and supplies.\r\n\r\nIn all of the 186 State of the Union messages delivered from this place, in\r\nour history this is the first in which the one priority, the first\r\npriority, is energy. Let me begin by reporting a new development which I\r\nknow will be welcome news to every American. As you know, we have committed\r\nourselves to an active role in helping to achieve a just and durable peace\r\nin the Middle East, on the basis of full implementation of Security Council\r\nResolutions 242 and 338. The first step in the process is the disengagement\r\nof Egyptian and Israeli forces which is now taking place.\r\n\r\nBecause of this hopeful development, I can announce tonight that I have\r\nbeen assured, through my personal contacts with friendly leaders in the\r\nMiddle Eastern area, that an urgent meeting will be called in the immediate\r\nfuture to discuss the lifting of the oil embargo.\r\n\r\nThis is an encouraging sign. However, it should be clearly understood by\r\nour friends in the Middle East that the United States will not be coerced\r\non this issue.\r\n\r\nRegardless of the outcome of this meeting, the cooperation of the American\r\npeople in our energy conservation program has already gone a long way\r\ntowards achieving a goal to which I am deeply dedicated. Let us do\r\neverything we can to avoid gasoline rationing in the United States of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nLast week, I sent to the Congress a comprehensive special message setting\r\nforth our energy situation, recommending the legislative measures which are\r\nnecessary to a program for meeting our needs. If the embargo is lifted,\r\nthis will ease the crisis, but it will not mean an end to the energy\r\nshortage in America. Voluntary conservation will continue to be necessary.\r\nAnd let me take this occasion to pay tribute once again to the splendid\r\nspirit of cooperation the American people have shown which has made\r\npossible our success in meeting this emergency up to this time.\r\n\r\nThe new legislation I have requested will also remain necessary. Therefore,\r\nI urge again that the energy measures that I have proposed be made the\r\nfirst priority of this session of the Congress. These measures will require\r\nthe oil companies and other energy producers to provide the public with the\r\nnecessary information on their supplies. They will prevent the injustice of\r\nwindfall profits for a few as a result of the sacrifices of the millions of\r\nAmericans. And they will give us the organization, the incentives, the\r\nauthorities needed to deal with the short-term emergency and to move toward\r\nmeeting our long-term needs.\r\n\r\nJust as 1970 was the year in which we began a full-scale effort to protect\r\nthe environment, 1974 must be the year in which we organize a full-scale\r\neffort to provide for our energy needs, not only in this decade but through\r\nthe 21st century.\r\n\r\nAs we move toward the celebration 2 years from now of the 200th anniversary\r\nof this Nation's independence, let us press vigorously on toward the goal I\r\nannounced last November for Project Independence. Let this be our national\r\ngoal: At the end of this decade, in the year 1980, the United States will\r\nnot be dependent on any other country for the energy we need to provide our\r\njobs, to heat our homes, and to keep our transportation moving.\r\n\r\nTo indicate the size of the Government commitment, to spur energy research\r\nand development, we plan to spend $10 billion in Federal funds over the\r\nnext 5 years. That is an enormous amount. But during the same 5 years,\r\nprivate enterprise will be investing as much as $200 billion--and in 10\r\nyears, $500 billion--to develop the new resources, the new technology, the\r\nnew capacity America will require for its energy needs in the 1980's. That\r\nis just a measure of the magnitude of the project we are undertaking.\r\n\r\nBut America performs best when called to its biggest tasks. It can truly be\r\nsaid that only in America could a task so tremendous be achieved so\r\nquickly, and achieved not by regimentation, but through the effort and\r\ningenuity of a free people, working in a free system.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the rest of the agenda for 1974, the time is at hand this\r\nyear to bring comprehensive, high quality health care within the reach of\r\nevery American. I shall propose a sweeping new program that will assure\r\ncomprehensive health insurance protection to millions of Americans who\r\ncannot now obtain it or afford it, with vastly improved protection against\r\ncatastrophic illnesses. This will be a plan that maintains the high\r\nstandards of quality in America's health care. And it will not require\r\nadditional taxes.\r\n\r\nNow, I recognize that other plans have been put forward that would cost $80\r\nbillion or even $100 billion and that would put our whole health care\r\nsystem under the heavy hand of the Federal Government. This is the wrong\r\napproach. This has been tried abroad, and it has failed. It is not the way\r\nwe do things here in America. This kind of plan would threaten the quality\r\nof care provided by our whole health care system. The right way is one that\r\nbuilds on the strengths of the present system and one that does not destroy\r\nthose strengths, one based on partnership, not paternalism. Most important\r\nof all, let us keep this as the guiding principle of our health programs.\r\nGovernment has a great role to play, but we must always make sure that our\r\ndoctors will be working for their patients and not for the Federal\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nMany of you will recall that in my State of the Union Address 3 years ago,\r\nI commented that \"Most Americans today are simply fed up with government at\r\nall levels,\" and I recommended a sweeping set of proposals to revitalize\r\nState and local governments, to make them more responsive to the people\r\nthey serve. I can report to you today that as a result of revenue sharing\r\npassed by the Congress, and other measures, we have made progress toward\r\nthat goal. After 40 years of moving power from the States and the\r\ncommunities to Washington, D.C., we have begun moving power back from\r\nWashington to the States and communities and, most important, to the people\r\nof America.\r\n\r\nIn this session of the Congress, I believe we are near the breakthrough\r\npoint on efforts which I have suggested, proposals to let people themselves\r\nmake their own decisions for their own communities and, in particular, on\r\nthose to provide broad new flexibility in Federal aid for community\r\ndevelopment, for economic development, for education. And I look forward to\r\nworking with the Congress, with members of both parties in resolving\r\nwhatever remaining differences we have in this legislation so that we can\r\nmake available nearly $5 1/2 billion to our States and localities to use\r\nnot for what a Federal bureaucrat may want, but for what their own people\r\nin those communities want. The decision should be theirs.\r\n\r\nI think all of us recognize that the energy crisis has given new urgency to\r\nthe need to improve public transportation, not only in our cities but in\r\nrural areas as well. The program I have proposed this year will give\r\ncommunities not only more money but also more freedom to balance their own\r\ntransportation needs. It will mark the strongest Federal commitment ever to\r\nthe improvement of mass transit as an essential element of the improvement\r\nof life in our towns and cities.\r\n\r\nOne goal on which all Americans agree is that our children should have the\r\nvery best education this great Nation can provide.\r\n\r\nIn a special message last week, I recommended a number of important new\r\nmeasures that can make 1974 a year of truly significant advances for our\r\nschools and for the children they serve. If the Congress will act on these\r\nproposals, more flexible funding will enable each Federal dollar to meet\r\nbetter the particular need of each particular school district. Advance\r\nfunding will give school authorities a chance to make each year's plans,\r\nknowing ahead of time what Federal funds they are going to receive. Special\r\ntargeting will give special help to the truly disadvantaged among our\r\npeople. College students faced with rising costs for their education will\r\nbe able to draw on an expanded program of loans and grants. These advances\r\nare a needed investment in America's most precious resource, our next\r\ngeneration. And I urge the Congress to act on this legislation in 1974.\r\n\r\nOne measure of a truly free society is the vigor with which it protects the\r\nliberties of its individual citizens. As technology has advanced in\r\nAmerica, it has increasingly encroached on one of those liberties--what I\r\nterm the right of personal privacy. Modern information systems, data banks,\r\ncredit records, mailing list abuses, electronic snooping, the collection of\r\npersonal data for one purpose that may be used for another--all these have\r\nleft millions of Americans deeply concerned by the privacy they cherish.\r\n\r\nAnd the time has come, therefore, for a major initiative to define the\r\nnature and extent of the basic rights of privacy and to erect new\r\nsafeguards to ensure that those rights are respected.\r\n\r\nI shall launch such an effort this year at the highest levels of the\r\nAdministration, and I look forward again to working with this Congress in\r\nestablishing a new set of standards that respect the legitimate needs of\r\nsociety, but that also recognize personal privacy as a cardinal principle\r\nof American liberty.\r\n\r\nMany of those in this Chamber tonight will recall that it was 3 years ago\r\nthat I termed the Nation's welfare system \"a monstrous, consuming\r\noutrage--an outrage against the community, against the taxpayer, and\r\nparticularly against the children that it is supposed to help.\"\r\n\r\nThat system is still an outrage. By improving its administration, we have\r\nbeen able to reduce some of the abuses. As a result, last year, for the\r\nfirst time in 18 years, there has been a halt in the growth of the welfare\r\ncaseload. But as a system, our welfare program still needs reform as\r\nurgently today as it did when I first proposed in 1969 that we completely\r\nreplace it with a different system.\r\n\r\nIn these final 3 years of my Administration, I urge the Congress to join me\r\nin mounting a major new effort to replace the discredited present welfare\r\nsystem with one that works, one that is fair to those who need help or\r\ncannot help themselves, fair to the community, and fair to the taxpayer.\r\nAnd let us have as our goal that there will be no Government program which\r\nmakes it more profitable to go on welfare than to go to work.\r\n\r\nI recognize that from the debates that have taken place within the Congress\r\nover the past 3 years on this program that we cannot expect enactment\r\novernight of a new reform. But I do propose that the Congress and the\r\nAdministration together make this the year in which we discuss, debate, and\r\nshape such a reform so that it can be enacted as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nAmerica's own prosperity in the years ahead depends on our sharing fully\r\nand equitably in an expanding world prosperity. Historic negotiations will\r\ntake place this year that will enable us to ensure fair treatment in\r\ninternational markets for American workers, American farmers, American\r\ninvestors, and American consumers.\r\n\r\nIt is vital that the authorities contained in the trade bill I submitted to\r\nthe Congress be enacted so that the United States can negotiate flexibly\r\nand vigorously on behalf of American interests. These negotiations can\r\nusher in a new era of international trade that not only increases the\r\nprosperity of all nations but also strengthens the peace among all\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nIn the past 5 years, we have made more progress toward a lasting structure\r\nof peace in the world than in any comparable time in the Nation's history.\r\nWe could not have made that progress if we had not maintained the military\r\nstrength of America. Thomas Jefferson once observed that the price of\r\nliberty is eternal vigilance. By the same token, and for the same reason,\r\nin today's world the price of peace is a strong defense as far as the\r\nUnited States is concerned.\r\n\r\nIn the past 5 years, we have steadily reduced the burden of national\r\ndefense as a share of the budget, bringing it down from 44 percent in 1969\r\nto 29 percent in the current year. We have cut our military manpower over\r\nthe past 5 years by more than a third, from 3.5 million to 2.2 million.\r\n\r\nIn the coming year, however, increased expenditures will be needed. They\r\nwill be needed to assure the continued readiness of our military forces, to\r\npreserve present force levels in the face of rising costs, and to give us\r\nthe military strength we must have if our security is to be maintained and\r\nif our initiatives for peace are to succeed.\r\n\r\nThe question is not whether we can afford to maintain the necessary\r\nstrength of our defense, the question is whether we can afford not to\r\nmaintain it, and the answer to that question is no. We must never allow\r\nAmerica to become the second strongest nation in the world.\r\n\r\nI do not say this with any sense of belligerence, because I recognize the\r\nfact that is recognized around the world. America's military strength has\r\nalways been maintained to keep the peace, never to break it. It has always\r\nbeen used to defend freedom, never to destroy it. The world's peace, as\r\nwell as our own, depends on our remaining as strong as we need to be as\r\nlong as we need to be.\r\n\r\nIn this year 1974, we will be negotiating with the Soviet Union to place\r\nfurther limits on strategic nuclear arms. Together with our allies, we will\r\nbe negotiating with the nations of the Warsaw Pact on mutual and balanced\r\nreduction of forces in Europe. And we will continue our efforts to promote\r\npeaceful economic development in Latin America, in Africa, in Asia. We will\r\npress for full compliance with the peace accords that brought an end to\r\nAmerican fighting in Indochina, including particularly a provision that\r\npromised the fullest possible accounting for those Americans who are\r\nmissing in action.\r\n\r\nAnd having in mind the energy crisis to which I have referred to earlier,\r\nwe will be working with the other nations of the world toward agreement on\r\nmeans by which oil supplies can be assured at reasonable prices on a stable\r\nbasis in a fair way to the consuming and producing nations alike.\r\n\r\nAll of these are steps toward a future in which the world's peace and\r\nprosperity, and ours as well as a result, are made more secure.\r\n\r\nThroughout the 5 years that I have served as your President, I have had one\r\noverriding aim, and that was to establish a new structure of peace in the\r\nworld that can free future generations of the scourge of war. I can\r\nunderstand that others may have different priorities. This has been and\r\nthis will remain my first priority and the chief legacy I hope to leave\r\nfrom the 8 years of my Presidency.\r\n\r\nThis does not mean that we shall not have other priorities, because as we\r\nstrengthen the peace, we must also continue each year a steady\r\nstrengthening of our society here at home. Our conscience requires it, our\r\ninterests require it, and we must insist upon it.\r\n\r\nAs we create more jobs, as we build a better health care system, as we\r\nimprove our education, as we develop new sources of energy, as we provide\r\nmore abundantly for the elderly and the poor, as we strengthen the system\r\nof private enterprise that produces our prosperity--as we do all of this\r\nand even more, we solidify those essential bonds that hold us together as\r\na nation.\r\n\r\nEven more importantly, we advance what in the final analysis government in\r\nAmerica is all about.\r\n\r\nWhat it is all about is more freedom, more security, a better life for each\r\none of the 211 million people that live in this land.\r\n\r\nWe cannot afford to neglect progress at home while pursuing peace abroad.\r\nBut neither can we afford to neglect peace abroad while pursuing progress\r\nat home. With a stable peace, all is possible, but without peace, nothing\r\nis possible.\r\n\r\nIn the written message that I have just delivered to the Speaker and to the\r\nPresident of the Senate, I commented that one of the continuing challenges\r\nfacing us in the legislative process is that of the timing and pacing of\r\nour initiatives, selecting each year among many worthy projects those that\r\nare ripe for action at that time.\r\n\r\nWhat is true in terms of our domestic initiatives is true also in the\r\nworld. This period we now are in, in the world--and I say this as one who\r\nhas seen so much of the world, not only in these past 5 years but going\r\nback over many years--we are in a period which presents a juncture of\r\nhistoric forces unique in this century. They provide an opportunity we may\r\nnever have again to create a structure of peace solid enough to last a\r\nlifetime and more, not just peace in our time but peace in our children's\r\ntime as well. It is on the way we respond to this opportunity, more than\r\nanything else, that history will judge whether we in America have met our\r\nresponsibility. And I am confident we will meet that great historic\r\nresponsibility which is ours today.\r\n\r\nIt was 27 years ago that John F. Kennedy and I sat in this Chamber, as\r\nfreshmen Congressmen, hearing our first State of the Union address\r\ndelivered by Harry Truman. I know from my talks with him, as members of the\r\nLabor Committee on which we both served, that neither of us then even\r\ndreamed that either one or both might eventually be standing in this place\r\nthat I now stand in now and that he once stood in, before me. It may well\r\nbe that one of the freshmen Members of the 93d Congress, one of you out\r\nthere, will deliver his own State of the Union message 27 years from now,\r\nin the year 2001.\r\n\r\nWell, whichever one it is, I want you to be able to look back with pride\r\nand to say that your first years here were great years and recall that you\r\nwere here in this 93d Congress when America ended its longest war and began\r\nits longest peace.\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, and Mr. President, and my distinguished colleagues and our\r\nguests: I would like to add a personal word with regard to an issue that\r\nhas been of great concern to all Americans over the past year. I refer, of\r\ncourse, to the investigations of the so-called Watergate affair. As you\r\nknow, I have provided to the Special Prosecutor voluntarily a great deal of\r\nmaterial. I believe that I have provided all the material that he needs to\r\nconclude his investigations and to proceed to prosecute the guilty and to\r\nclear the innocent.\r\n\r\nI believe the time has come to bring that investigation and the other\r\ninvestigations of this matter to an end. One year of Watergate is enough.\r\n\r\nAnd the time has come, my colleagues, for not only the Executive, the\r\nPresident, but the Members of Congress, for all of us to join together in\r\ndevoting our full energies to these great issues that I have discussed\r\ntonight which involve the welfare of all of the American people in so many\r\ndifferent ways, as well as the peace of the world.\r\n\r\nI recognize that the House Judiciary Committee has a special responsibility\r\nin this area, and I want to indicate on this occasion that I will cooperate\r\nwith the Judiciary Committee in its investigation. I will cooperate so that\r\nit can conclude its investigation, make its decision, and I will cooperate\r\nin any way that I consider consistent with my responsibilities to the\r\nOffice of the Presidency of the United States.\r\n\r\nThere is only one limitation. I will follow the precedent that has been\r\nfollowed by and defended by every President from George Washington to\r\nLyndon B. Johnson of never doing anything that weakens the Office of the\r\nPresident of the United States or impairs the ability of the Presidents of\r\nthe future to make the great decisions that are so essential to this Nation\r\nand the world.\r\n\r\nAnother point I should like to make very briefly: Like every Member of the\r\nHouse and Senate assembled here tonight, I was elected to the office that I\r\nhold. And like every Member of the House and Senate, when I was elected to\r\nthat office, I knew that I was elected for the purpose of doing a job and\r\ndoing it as well as I possibly can. And I want you to know that I have no\r\nintention whatever of ever walking away from the job that the people\r\nelected me to do for the people of the United States.\r\n\r\nNow, needless to say, it would be understatement if I were not to admit\r\nthat the year 1973 was not a very easy year for me personally or for my\r\nfamily. And as I have already indicated, the year 1974 presents very great\r\nand serious problems, as very great and serious opportunities are also\r\npresented.\r\n\r\nBut my colleagues, this I believe: With the help of God, who has blessed\r\nthis land so richly, with the cooperation of the Congress, and with the\r\nsupport of the American people, we can and we will make the year 1974 a\r\nyear of unprecedented progress toward our goal of building a structure of\r\nlasting peace in the world and a new prosperity without war in the United\r\nStates of America.",
