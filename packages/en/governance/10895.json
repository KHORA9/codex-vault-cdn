RICHARDSON\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Madison\r\n\r\nMarch 4, 1809, to March 4, 1817\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Madison\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Madison was born in King George County, Va., on the 16th of March,\r\n1751. He was the son of James Madison, the family being of English\r\ndescent, and among the early settlers of Virginia. Was fitted for\r\ncollege by private tutors, and entered Princeton College in 1769,\r\ngraduating in 1771; remained a year at college pursuing his studies.\r\nAfter this he returned to Virginia and began the practice of law. In\r\n1776 was elected a member of the general assembly of Virginia, and in\r\n1778 was appointed a member of the executive council. In the winter of\r\n1779-80 was chosen a delegate to the Continental Congress, of which body\r\nhe continued an active and prominent member till 1784. The legislature\r\nof Virginia appointed him in 1786 a delegate to a convention at\r\nAnnapolis, Md., to devise a system of commercial regulations for all the\r\nStates. Upon their recommendation a convention of delegates from all the\r\nStates was held in Philadelphia in May, 1787. This Convention framed the\r\nConstitution of the United States, and of it Mr. Madison was a leading\r\nmember. He was next a member of the convention of his State which met to\r\nconsider the new Constitution for the United States. Was a member of the\r\nHouse of Representatives in the First Congress, taking his seat in\r\nApril, 1789, and continued to be a member of the House during both of\r\nWashington's terms as President. He married Mrs. Dolly Paine Todd, of\r\nPhiladelphia, in 1794, she being the widow of a Pennsylvania lawyer. Her\r\nfather was a Quaker, and had removed from Virginia to Philadelphia.\r\nDeclined the office of Secretary of State, vacated by Jefferson, in\r\n1793. He retired from Congress in 1797, and in 1798 accepted a seat in\r\nthe Virginia assembly. In 1801 was appointed by President Jefferson\r\nSecretary of State, which office he held during the eight years of\r\nJefferson's Administration. In 1808 was elected President, and was\r\nreelected in 1812. On March 4, 1817, he retired from public life, and\r\npassed the remainder of his days at Montpelier, in Orange County, Va. In\r\n1829 was chosen a member of the State convention to revise the\r\nconstitution of Virginia, and was also chosen president of an\r\nagricultural society in his county. He died on the 28th day of June,\r\n1836, and was buried at his home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT ELECT.\r\n\r\nThe President of the Senate communicated the following letter from the\r\nPresident elect of the United States:\r\n\r\nCITY OF WASHINGTON, _March 2, 1809_.\r\n\r\nHon. JOHN MILLEDGE,\r\n\r\n_President pro tempore of the Senate_.\r\n\r\nSIR: I beg leave through you to inform the honorable the Senate of the\r\nUnited States that I propose to take the oath which the Constitution\r\nprescribes to the President of the United States before he enters on the\r\nexecution of his office on Saturday, the 4th instant, at 12 o'clock, in\r\nthe Chamber of the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, sir, your most\r\nobedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST INAUGURAL ADDRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnwilling to depart from examples of the most revered authority, I avail\r\nmyself of the occasion now presented to express the profound impression\r\nmade on me by the call of my country to the station to the duties of\r\nwhich I am about to pledge myself by the most solemn of sanctions. So\r\ndistinguished a mark of confidence, proceeding from the deliberate and\r\ntranquil suffrage of a free and virtuous nation, would under any\r\ncircumstances have commanded my gratitude and devotion, as well as\r\nfilled me with an awful sense of the trust to be assumed. Under the\r\nvarious circumstances which give peculiar solemnity to the existing\r\nperiod, I feel that both the honor and the responsibility allotted to me\r\nare inexpressibly enhanced.\r\n\r\nThe present situation of the world is indeed without a parallel, and\r\nthat of our own country full of difficulties. The pressure of these,\r\ntoo, is the more severely felt because they have fallen upon us at a\r\nmoment when the national prosperity being at a height not before\r\nattained, the contrast resulting from the change has been rendered the\r\nmore striking. Under the benign influence of our republican\r\ninstitutions, and the maintenance of peace with all nations whilst so\r\nmany of them were engaged in bloody and wasteful wars, the fruits of a\r\njust policy were enjoyed in an unrivaled growth of our faculties and\r\nresources. Proofs of this were seen in the improvements of agriculture,\r\nin the successful enterprises of commerce, in the progress of\r\nmanufactures and useful arts, in the increase of the public revenue and\r\nthe use made of it in reducing the public debt, and in the valuable\r\nworks and establishments everywhere multiplying over the face of our\r\nland.\r\n\r\nIt is a precious reflection that the transition from this prosperous\r\ncondition of our country to the scene which has for some time been\r\ndistressing us is not chargeable on any unwarrantable views, nor, as I\r\ntrust, on any involuntary errors in the public councils. Indulging no\r\npassions which trespass on the rights or the repose of other nations, it\r\nhas been the true glory of the United States to cultivate peace by\r\nobserving justice, and to entitle themselves to the respect of the\r\nnations at war by fulfilling their neutral obligations with the most\r\nscrupulous impartiality. If there be candor in the world, the truth of\r\nthese assertions will not be questioned; posterity at least will do\r\njustice to them.\r\n\r\nThis unexceptionable course could not avail against the injustice and\r\nviolence of the belligerent powers. In their rage against each other, or\r\nimpelled by more direct motives, principles of retaliation have been\r\nintroduced equally contrary to universal reason and acknowledged law.\r\nHow long their arbitrary edicts will be continued in spite of the\r\ndemonstrations that not even a pretext for them has been given by the\r\nUnited States, and of the fair and liberal attempt to induce a\r\nrevocation of them, can not be anticipated. Assuring myself that under\r\nevery vicissitude the determined spirit and united councils of the\r\nnation will be safeguards to its honor and its essential interests, I\r\nrepair to the post assigned me with no other discouragement than what\r\nsprings from my own inadequacy to its high duties. If I do not sink\r\nunder the weight of this deep conviction it is because I find some\r\nsupport in a consciousness of the purposes and a confidence in the\r\nprinciples which I bring with me into this arduous service.\r\n\r\nTo cherish peace and friendly intercourse with all nations having\r\ncorrespondent dispositions; to maintain sincere neutrality toward\r\nbelligerent nations; to prefer in all cases amicable discussion and\r\nreasonable accommodation of differences to a decision of them by an\r\nappeal to arms; to exclude foreign intrigues and foreign partialities,\r\nso degrading to all countries and so baneful to free ones; to foster a\r\nspirit of independence too just to invade the rights of others, too\r\nproud to surrender our own, too liberal to indulge unworthy prejudices\r\nourselves and too elevated not to look down upon them in others; to hold\r\nthe union of the States as the basis of their peace and happiness; to\r\nsupport the Constitution, which is the cement of the Union, as well in\r\nits limitations as in its authorities; to respect the rights and\r\nauthorities reserved to the States and to the people as equally\r\nincorporated with and essential to the success of the general system; to\r\navoid the slightest interference with the rights of conscience or the\r\nfunctions of religion, so wisely exempted from civil jurisdiction; to\r\npreserve in their full energy the other salutary provisions in behalf of\r\nprivate and personal rights, and of the freedom of the press; to observe\r\neconomy in public expenditures; to liberate the public resources by an\r\nhonorable discharge of the public debts; to keep within the requisite\r\nlimits a standing military force, always remembering that an armed and\r\ntrained militia is the firmest bulwark of republics--that without\r\nstanding armies their liberty can never be in danger, nor with large\r\nones safe; to promote by authorized means improvements friendly to\r\nagriculture, to manufactures, and to external as well as internal\r\ncommerce; to favor in like manner the advancement of science and the\r\ndiffusion of information as the best aliment to true liberty; to carry\r\non the benevolent plans which have been so meritoriously applied to the\r\nconversion of our aboriginal neighbors from the degradation and\r\nwretchedness of savage life to a participation of the improvements of\r\nwhich the human mind and manners are susceptible in a civilized\r\nstate--as far as sentiments and intentions such as these can aid the\r\nfulfillment of my duty, they will be a resource which can not fail me.\r\n\r\nIt is my good fortune, moreover, to have the path in which I am to tread\r\nlighted by examples of illustrious services successfully rendered in the\r\nmost trying difficulties by those who have marched before me. Of those\r\nof my immediate predecessor it might least become me here to speak. I\r\nmay, however, be pardoned for not suppressing the sympathy with which my\r\nheart is full in the rich reward he enjoys in the benedictions of a\r\nbeloved country, gratefully bestowed for exalted talents zealously\r\ndevoted through a long career to the advancement of its highest interest\r\nand happiness.\r\n\r\nBut the source to which I look for the aids which alone can supply my\r\ndeficiencies is in the well-tried intelligence and virtue of my\r\nfellow-citizens, and in the counsels of those representing them in the\r\nother departments associated in the care of the national interests. In\r\nthese my confidence will under every difficulty be best placed, next to\r\nthat which we have all been encouraged to feel in the guardianship and\r\nguidance of that Almighty Being whose power regulates the destiny of\r\nnations, whose blessings have been so conspicuously dispensed to this\r\nrising Republic, and to whom we are bound to address our devout\r\ngratitude for the past, as well as our fervent supplications and best\r\nhopes for the future.\r\n\r\nMARCH 4, 1809.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL SESSION MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nOn this first occasion of meeting you it affords me much satisfaction to\r\nbe able to communicate the commencement of a favorable change in our\r\nforeign relations, the critical state of which induced a session of\r\nCongress at this early period.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the provisions of the act interdicting commercial\r\nintercourse with Great Britain and France, our ministers at London and\r\nParis were without delay instructed to let it be understood by the\r\nFrench and British Governments that the authority vested in the\r\nExecutive to renew commercial intercourse with their respective nations\r\nwould be exercised in the case specified by that act.\r\n\r\nSoon after these instructions were dispatched it was found that the\r\nBritish Government, anticipating from early proceedings of Congress at\r\ntheir last session the state of our laws, which has had the effect of\r\nplacing the two belligerent powers on a footing of equal restrictions,\r\nand relying on the conciliatory disposition of the United States, had\r\ntransmitted to their legation here provisional instructions not only to\r\noffer satisfaction for the attack on the frigate _Chesapeake_, and\r\nto make known the determination of His Britannic Majesty to send an\r\nenvoy extraordinary with powers to conclude a treaty on all the points\r\nbetween the two countries, but, moreover, to signify his willingness in\r\nthe meantime to withdraw his orders in council, in the persuasion that\r\nthe intercourse with Great Britain would be renewed on the part of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThese steps of the British Government led to the correspondence and the\r\nproclamation now laid before you, by virtue of which the commerce\r\nbetween the two countries will be renewable after the 10th day of June\r\nnext.\r\n\r\nWhilst I take pleasure in doing justice to the councils of His Britannic\r\nMajesty, which, no longer adhering to the policy which made an\r\nabandonment by France of her decrees a prerequisite to a revocation of\r\nthe British orders, have substituted the amicable course which has\r\nissued thus happily, I can not do less than refer to the proposal\r\nheretofore made on the part of the United States, embracing a like\r\nrestoration of the suspended commerce, as a proof of the spirit of\r\naccommodation which has at no time been intermitted, and to the result\r\nwhich now calls for our congratulations, as corroborating the principles\r\nby which the public councils have been guided during a period of the\r\nmost trying embarrassments.\r\n\r\nThe discontinuance of the British orders as they respect the United\r\nStates having been thus arranged, a communication of the event has been\r\nforwarded in one of our public vessels to our minister plenipotentiary\r\nat Paris, with instructions to avail himself of the important addition\r\nthereby made to the considerations which press on the justice of the\r\nFrench Government a revocation of its decrees or such a modification of\r\nthem as that they shall cease to violate the neutral commerce of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThe revision of our commercial laws proper to adapt them to the\r\narrangement which has taken place with Great Britain will doubtless\r\nengage the early attention of Congress. It will be worthy at the same\r\ntime of their just and provident care to make such further alterations\r\nin the laws as will more especially protect and foster the several\r\nbranches of manufacture which have been recently instituted or extended\r\nby the laudable exertions of our citizens.\r\n\r\nUnder the existing aspect of our affairs I have thought it not\r\ninconsistent with a just precaution to have the gunboats, with the\r\nexception of those at New Orleans, placed in a situation incurring no\r\nexpense beyond that requisite for their preservation and conveniency for\r\nfuture service, and to have the crews of those at New Orleans reduced to\r\nthe number required for their navigation and safety.\r\n\r\nI have thought also that our citizens detached in quotas of militia\r\namounting to 100,000 under the act of March, 1808, might not improperly\r\nbe relieved from the state in which they were held for immediate\r\nservice. A discharge of them has been accordingly directed.\r\n\r\nThe progress made in raising and organizing the additional military\r\nforce, for which provision was made by the act of April, 1808, together\r\nwith the disposition of the troops, will appear by a report which the\r\nSecretary of War is preparing, and which will be laid before you.\r\n\r\nOf the additional frigates required by an act of the last session to be\r\nfitted for actual service, two are in readiness, one nearly so, and the\r\nfourth is expected to be ready in the month of July. A report which the\r\nSecretary of the Navy is preparing on the subject, to be laid before\r\nCongress, will shew at the same time the progress made in officering and\r\nmanning these ships. It will shew also the degree in which the\r\nprovisions of the act relating to the other public armed ships have been\r\ncarried into execution.\r\n\r\nIt will rest with the judgment of Congress to decide how far the change\r\nin our external prospects may authorize any modifications of the laws\r\nrelating to the army and navy establishments.\r\n\r\nThe works of defense for our seaport towns and harbors have proceeded\r\nwith as much activity as the season of the year and other circumstances\r\nwould admit. It is necessary, however, to state that, the appropriations\r\nhitherto made being found to be deficient, a further provision will\r\nclaim the early consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the 8 per cent stock remaining due by the United States,\r\namounting to $5,300,000, had been reimbursed on the last day of the year\r\n1808; and on the 1st day of April last the sum in the Treasury exceeded\r\n$9,500,000. This, together with the receipts of the current year on\r\naccount of former revenue bonds, will probably be nearly if not\r\naltogether sufficient to defray the expenses of the year. But the\r\nsuspension of exports and the consequent decrease of importations during\r\nthe last twelve months will necessarily cause a great diminution in the\r\nreceipts of the year 1810. After that year, should our foreign relations\r\nbe undisturbed, the revenue will again be more than commensurate to all\r\nthe expenditures.\r\n\r\nAware of the inconveniences of a protracted session at the present\r\nseason of the year, I forbear to call the attention of the Legislature\r\nto any matters not particularly urgent. It remains, therefore, only to\r\nassure you of the fidelity and alacrity with which I shall cooperate\r\nfor the welfare and happiness of our country, and to pray that it may\r\nexperience a continuance of the divine blessings by which it has been\r\nso signally favored.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nMAY 23, 1809.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY 26, 1809.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI now lay before Congress the report of the Secretary of War, shewing\r\nthe progress made in carrying into effect the act of April, 1808, for\r\nraising an additional military force, and the disposition of the troops.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNE 4, 1809.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the request of the legislature of Pennsylvania, I\r\ntransmit to Congress a copy of certain of its proceedings, communicated\r\nfor the purpose by the governor of that State.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNE 15, 1809.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 13th instant,\r\nI transmit extracts from letters from Mr. Pinkney to the Secretary of\r\nState, accompanied by letters and communications to him from the British\r\nsecretary of state for the foreign department, all of which have been\r\nreceived here since the last session of Congress.\r\n\r\nTo these documents are added a communication just made by Mr. Erskine\r\nto the Secretary of State, and his answer.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNE 20, 1809.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 19th instant, I\r\ntransmit such information as has been received respecting exiles from\r\nCuba arrived or expected within the United States; also a letter from\r\nGeneral Turreau connected with that subject.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNE 26, 1809.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe considerations which led to the nomination of a minister\r\nplenipotentiary to Russia being strengthened by evidence since received\r\nof the earnest desire of the Emperor to establish a diplomatic\r\nintercourse between the two countries, and of a disposition in his\r\ncouncils favorable to the extension of a commerce mutually advantageous,\r\nas will be seen by the extracts from letters from General Armstrong and\r\nConsul Harris herewith confidentially communicated, I nominate John\r\nQuincy Adams, of Massachusetts, to be minister plenipotentiary of the\r\nUnited States to the Court of St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[From Annals of Congress, Eleventh Congress, part 2, 2060.]\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas it is provided by the eleventh section of the act of Congress\r\nentitled \"An act to interdict the commercial intercourse between the\r\nUnited States and Great Britain and France and their dependencies, and\r\nfor other purposes,\" that \"in case either France or Great Britain shall\r\nso revoke or modify her edicts as that they shall cease to violate the\r\nneutral commerce of the United States\" the President is authorized to\r\ndeclare the same by proclamation, after which the trade suspended by the\r\nsaid act and by an act laying an embargo on all ships and vessels in the\r\nports and harbors of the United States and the several acts\r\nsupplementary thereto may be renewed with the nation so doing; and\r\n\r\nWhereas the Honorable David Montague Erskine, His Britannic Majesty's\r\nenvoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary, has, by the order and\r\nin the name of his Sovereign, declared to this Government that the\r\nBritish orders in council of January and November, 1807, will have been\r\nwithdrawn as respects the United States on the 10th day of June next:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, James Madison, President of the United States, do\r\nhereby proclaim that the orders in council aforesaid will have been\r\nwithdrawn on the said 10th day of June next, after which day the trade\r\nof the United States with Great Britain, as suspended by the act of\r\nCongress above mentioned and an act laying an embargo on all ships and\r\nvessels in the ports and harbors of the United States and the several\r\nacts supplementary thereto, may be renewed.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand and the seal of the United States at Washington,\r\nthe 19th day of April, A.D. 1809, and of the Independence of the United\r\nStates the thirty-third.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  R. SMITH,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From Annals of Congress, Eleventh Congress, part 2, 2076.]\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas, in consequence of a communication from His Britannic Majesty's\r\nenvoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary declaring that the\r\nBritish orders of council of January and November, 1807, would have been\r\nwithdrawn on the 10th day of June last, and by virtue of authority given\r\nin such event by the eleventh section of the act of Congress entitled\r\n\"An act to interdict the commercial intercourse between the United\r\nStates and Great Britain and France and their dependencies, and for\r\nother purposes,\" I, James Madison, President of the United States, did\r\nissue my proclamation bearing date on the 19th of April last, declaring\r\nthat the orders in council aforesaid would have been so withdrawn on the\r\nsaid 10th day of June, after which the trade suspended by certain acts\r\nof Congress might be renewed; and\r\n\r\nWhereas it is now officially made known to me that the said orders in\r\ncouncil have not been withdrawn agreeably to the communication and\r\ndeclaration aforesaid:\r\n\r\nI do hereby proclaim the same, and, consequently, that the trade\r\nrenewable on the event of the said orders, being withdrawn, is to be\r\nconsidered as under the operation of the several acts by which such\r\ntrade was suspended.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand and the seal of the United States at the city of\r\nWashington, the 9th day of August, A.D. 1809, and of the Independence\r\nof the said United States the thirty-fourth.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  R. SMITH,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 29, 1809.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nAt the period of our last meeting I had the satisfaction of\r\ncommunicating an adjustment with one of the principal belligerent\r\nnations, highly important in itself, and still more so as presaging a\r\nmore extended accommodation. It is with deep concern I am now to inform\r\nyou that the favorable prospect has been overclouded by a refusal of the\r\nBritish Government to abide by the act of its minister plenipotentiary,\r\nand by its ensuing policy toward the United States as seen through the\r\ncommunications of the minister sent to replace him.\r\n\r\nWhatever pleas may be urged for a disavowal of engagements formed by\r\ndiplomatic functionaries in cases where by the terms of the engagements\r\na mutual ratification is reserved, or where notice at the time may have\r\nbeen given of a departure from instructions, or in extraordinary cases\r\nessentially violating the principles of equity, a disavowal could not\r\nhave been apprehended in a case where no such notice or violation\r\nexisted, where no such ratification was reserved, and more especially\r\nwhere, as is now in proof, an engagement to be executed without any such\r\nratification was contemplated by the instructions given, and where it\r\nhad with good faith been carried into immediate execution on the part of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nThese considerations not having restrained the British Government from\r\ndisavowing the arrangement by virtue of which its orders in council were\r\nto be revoked, and the event authorizing the renewal of commercial\r\nintercourse having thus not taken place, it necessarily became a\r\nquestion of equal urgency and importance whether the act prohibiting\r\nthat intercourse was not to be considered as remaining in legal force.\r\nThis question being, after due deliberation, determined in the\r\naffirmative, a proclamation to that effect was issued. It could not but\r\nhappen, however, that a return to this state of things from that which\r\nhad followed an execution of the arrangement by the United States would\r\ninvolve difficulties. With a view to diminish these as much as possible,\r\nthe instructions from the Secretary of the Treasury now laid before you\r\nwere transmitted to the collectors of the several ports. If in\r\npermitting British vessels to depart without giving bonds not to proceed\r\nto their own ports it should appear that the tenor of legal authority\r\nhas not been strictly pursued, it is to be ascribed to the anxious\r\ndesire which was felt that no individuals should be injured by so\r\nunforeseen an occurrence; and I rely on the regard of Congress for\r\nthe equitable interests of our own citizens to adopt whatever further\r\nprovisions may be found requisite for a general remission of penalties\r\ninvoluntarily incurred.\r\n\r\nThe recall of the disavowed minister having been followed by the\r\nappointment of a successor, hopes were indulged that the new mission\r\nwould contribute to alleviate the disappointment which had been\r\nproduced, and to remove the causes which had so long embarrassed the\r\ngood understanding of the two nations. It could not be doubted that it\r\nwould at least be charged with conciliatory explanations of the step\r\nwhich had been taken and with proposals to be substituted for the\r\nrejected arrangement. Reasonable and universal as this expectation was,\r\nit also has not been fulfilled. From the first official disclosures of\r\nthe new minister it was found that he had received no authority to enter\r\ninto explanations relative to either branch of the arrangement disavowed\r\nnor any authority to substitute proposals as to that branch which\r\nconcerned the British orders in council, and, finally, that his\r\nproposals with respect to the other branch, the attack on the frigate\r\n_Chesapeake_, were founded on a presumption repeatedly declared to\r\nbe inadmissible by the United States, that the first step toward\r\nadjustment was due from them, the proposals at the same time omitting\r\neven a reference to the officer answerable for the murderous aggression,\r\nand asserting a claim not less contrary to the British laws and British\r\npractice than to the principles and obligations of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence between the Department of State and this minister\r\nwill show how unessentially the features presented in its commencement\r\nhave been varied in its progress. It will show also that, forgetting the\r\nrespect due to all governments, he did not refrain from imputations on\r\nthis, which required that no further communications should be received\r\nfrom him. The necessity of this step will be made known to His Britannic\r\nMajesty through the minister plenipotentiary of the United States in\r\nLondon; and it would indicate a want of the confidence due to a\r\nGovernment which so well understands and exacts what becomes foreign\r\nministers near it not to infer that the misconduct of its own\r\nrepresentative will be viewed in the same light in which it has been\r\nregarded here. The British Government will learn at the same time that\r\na ready attention will be given to communications through any channel\r\nwhich may be substituted. It will be happy if the change in this respect\r\nshould be accompanied by a favorable revision of the unfriendly policy\r\nwhich has been so long pursued toward the United States.\r\n\r\nWith France, the other belligerent, whose trespasses on our commercial\r\nrights have long been the subject of our just remonstrances, the posture\r\nof our relations does not correspond with the measures taken on the part\r\nof the United States to effect a favorable change. The result of the\r\nseveral communications made to her Government, in pursuance of the\r\nauthorities vested by Congress in the Executive, is contained in the\r\ncorrespondence of our minister at Paris now laid before you.\r\n\r\nBy some of the other belligerents, although professing just and amicable\r\ndispositions, injuries materially affecting our commerce have not been\r\nduly controlled or repressed. In these cases the interpositions deemed\r\nproper on our part have not been omitted. But it well deserves the\r\nconsideration of the Legislature how far both the safety and the honor\r\nof the American flag may be consulted, by adequate provisions against\r\nthat collusive prostitution of it by individuals unworthy of the\r\nAmerican name which has so much favored the real or pretended suspicions\r\nunder which the honest commerce of their fellow-citizens has suffered.\r\n\r\nIn relation to the powers on the coast of Barbary, nothing has occurred\r\nwhich is not of a nature rather to inspire confidence than distrust as\r\nto the continuance of the existing amity. With our Indian neighbors, the\r\njust and benevolent system continued toward them has also preserved\r\npeace, and is more and more advancing habits favorable to their\r\ncivilization and happiness.\r\n\r\nFrom a statement which will be made by the Secretary of War it will be\r\nseen that the fortifications on our maritime frontier are in many of the\r\nports completed, affording the defense which was contemplated, and that\r\na further time will be required to render complete the works in the\r\nharbor of New York and in some other places. By the enlargement of the\r\nworks and the employment of a greater number of hands at the public\r\narmories the supply of small arms of an improving quality appears to be\r\nannually increasing at a rate that, with those made on private contract,\r\nmay be expected to go far toward providing for the public exigency.\r\n\r\nThe act of Congress providing for the equipment of our vessels of war\r\nhaving been fully carried into execution, I refer to the statement of\r\nthe Secretary of the Navy for the information which may be proper on\r\nthat subject. To that statement is added a view of the transfers of\r\nappropriations authorized by the act of the session preceding the last\r\nand of the grounds on which the transfers were made.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the course of your deliberations on the subject of our\r\nmilitary establishments, I should fail in my duty in not recommending\r\nto your serious attention the importance of giving to our militia, the\r\ngreat bulwark of our security and resource of our power, an organization\r\nthe best adapted to eventual situations for which the United States\r\nought to be prepared.\r\n\r\nThe sums which had been previously accumulated in the Treasury, together\r\nwith the receipts during the year ending on the 30th of September last\r\n(and amounting to more than $9,000,000), have enabled us to fulfill all\r\nour engagements and to defray the current expenses of Government without\r\nrecurring to any loan. But the insecurity of our commerce and the\r\nconsequent diminution of the public revenue will probably produce a\r\ndeficiency in the receipts of the ensuing year, for which and for other\r\ndetails I refer to the statements which will be transmitted from the\r\nTreasury.\r\n\r\nIn the state which has been presented of our affairs with the great\r\nparties to a disastrous and protracted war, carried on in a mode equally\r\ninjurious and unjust to the United States as a neutral nation, the\r\nwisdom of the National legislature will be again summoned to the\r\nimportant decision on the alternatives before them. That these will be\r\nmet in a spirit worthy the councils of a nation conscious both of its\r\nrectitude and of its rights, and careful as well of its honor as of its\r\npeace, I have an entire confidence; and that the result will be stamped\r\nby a unanimity becoming the occasion, and be supported by every portion\r\nof our citizens with a patriotism enlightened and invigorated by\r\nexperience, ought as little to be doubted.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the wrongs and vexations experienced from external\r\ncauses there is much room for congratulation on the prosperity and\r\nhappiness flowing from our situation at home. The blessing of health\r\nhas never been more universal. The fruits of the seasons, though in\r\nparticular articles and districts short of their usual redundancy, are\r\nmore than sufficient for our wants and our comforts. The face of our\r\ncountry everywhere presents the evidence of laudable enterprise, of\r\nextensive capital, and of durable improvement. In a cultivation of the\r\nmaterials and the extension of useful manufactures, more especially\r\nin the general application to household fabrics, we behold a rapid\r\ndiminution of our dependence on foreign supplies. Nor is it unworthy\r\nof reflection that this revolution in our pursuits and habits is in no\r\nslight degree a consequence of those impolitic and arbitrary edicts by\r\nwhich the contending nations, in endeavoring each of them to obstruct\r\nour trade with the other, have so far abridged our means of procuring\r\nthe productions and manufactures of which our own are now taking the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nRecollecting always that for every advantage which may contribute to\r\ndistinguish our lot from that to which others are doomed by the unhappy\r\nspirit of the times we are indebted to that Divine Providence whose\r\ngoodness has been so remarkably extended to this rising nation, it\r\nbecomes us to cherish a devout gratitude, and to implore from the same\r\nomnipotent source a blessing on the consultations and measures about to\r\nbe undertaken for the welfare of our beloved country.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 12, 1809.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nAccording to the request of the House of Representatives expressed in\r\ntheir resolution of the 11th instant, I now lay before them a printed\r\ncopy of a paper purporting to be a circular letter from Mr. Jackson to\r\nthe British consuls in the United States, as received in a Gazette at\r\nthe Department of State; and also a printed paper received in a letter\r\nfrom our minister in London, purporting to be a copy of a dispatch from\r\nMr. Canning to Mr. Erskine of the 23d of January last.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 16, 1809.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nAgreeably to the request in the resolution of the 15th instant, I\r\ntransmit a copy of the correspondence with the governor of Pennsylvania\r\nin the case of Gideon Olmstead,\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 16, 1809.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nAgreeably to the request expressed in the resolution of the 13th\r\ninstant, I lay before the House extracts from the correspondence of the\r\nminister plenipotentiary of the United States at London.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 22, 1809.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI lay before the Senate, for their consideration whether they will\r\nadvise and consent to the ratification thereof, a treaty concluded on\r\nthe 30th September last with the Delaware, Potawattamie, Miami, and\r\nEel-river Miami Indian tribes northwest of the Ohio; a separate article\r\nof the same date, with the said tribes, and a convention with the Weea\r\ntribe, concluded on the 26th October last; the whole being accompanied\r\nwith the explanatory documents,\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 3, 1810.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe act authorizing a detachment of 100,000 men from the militia will\r\nexpire on the 30th of March next. Its early revival is recommended, in\r\norder that timely steps may be taken for arrangements such as the act\r\ncontemplated.\r\n\r\nWithout interfering with the modifications rendered necessary by the\r\ndefects or the inefficacy of the laws restrictive of commerce and\r\nnavigation, or with the policy of disallowing to foreign armed vessels\r\nthe use of our waters, it falls within my duty to recommend also that,\r\nin addition to the precautionary measure authorized by that act and to\r\nthe regular troops for completing the legal establishment of which\r\nenlistments are renewed, every necessary provision may be made for a\r\nvolunteer force of 20,000 men, to be enlisted for a short period and\r\nheld in a state of organization and readiness for actual service at the\r\nshortest warning.\r\n\r\nI submit to the consideration of Congress, moreover, the expediency of\r\nsuch a classification and organization of the militia as will best\r\ninsure prompt and successive aids from that source, adequate to\r\nemergencies which may call for them.\r\n\r\nIt will rest with them also to determine how far further provision may\r\nbe expedient for putting into actual service, if necessary, any part of\r\nthe naval armament not now employed.\r\n\r\nAt a period presenting features in the conduct of foreign powers toward\r\nthe United States which impose on them the necessity of precautionary\r\nmeasures involving expense, it is a happy consideration that such is the\r\nsolid state of the public credit that reliance may be justly placed on\r\nany legal provision that may be made for resorting to it in a convenient\r\nform and to an adequate amount,\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 9, 1810.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI lay before the Senate, for their consideration whether they will\r\nadvise and consent to the ratification thereof, a treaty concluded on\r\nthe 9th day of December last with the Kickapoo tribe of Indians,\r\naccompanied by explanations in an extract of a letter from the governor\r\nof the Indiana Territory,\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 15, 1810.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI lay before the Senate, for their consideration whether they will\r\nadvise and consent to the ratification thereof, a treaty concluded with\r\nthe Great and Little Osage Indians on the 10th day of November, 1808,\r\nand the 31st day of August, 1809.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 22, 1810.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate a report of the Secretary of the Treasury,\r\ncomplying with their resolution of the 27th of December, on the subject\r\nof disbursements in the intercourse with the Barbary Powers.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 28, 1810.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI now lay before you copies of the treaties concluded with the Delaware,\r\nPottawatamie, Miami, Eel River, and Wea tribes of Indians for the\r\nextinguishment of their title to the lands therein described, and I\r\nrecommend to the consideration of Congress the making provision by law\r\nfor carrying them into execution.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 15, 1810.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nA treaty having been entered into and duly ratified with the Kickapoo\r\ntribe of Indians for the extinguishment of their title to certain lands\r\nwithin the Indiana Territory, involving conditions which require\r\nlegislative provision, I submit copies thereof to both branches for\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 27, 1810,\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn consequence of your resolution of the 26th instant, an inquiry has\r\nbeen made into the correspondence of our minister at the Court of London\r\nwith the Department of State, from which it appears that no official\r\ncommunication has been received from him since his receipt of the letter\r\nof November 23 last from the Secretary of State. A letter of January 4,\r\n1810, has been received from that minister by Mr. Smith, but being\r\nstated to be private and unofficial, and involving, moreover, personal\r\nconsiderations of a delicate nature, a copy is considered as not within\r\nthe purview of the call of the House.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas the territory south of the Mississippi Territory and eastward of\r\nthe river Mississippi, and extending to the river Perdido, of which\r\npossession was not delivered to the United States in pursuance of the\r\ntreaty concluded at Paris on the 30th April, 1803, has at all times, as\r\nis well known, been considered and claimed by them as being within the\r\ncolony of Louisiana conveyed by the said treaty in the same extent that\r\nit had in the hands of Spain and that it had when France originally\r\npossessed it; and\r\n\r\nWhereas the acquiescence of the United States in the temporary\r\ncontinuance of the said territory under the Spanish authority was not\r\nthe result of any distrust of their title, as has been particularly\r\nevinced by the general tenor of their laws and by the distinction made\r\nin the application of those laws between that territory and foreign\r\ncountries, but was occasioned by their conciliatory views and by a\r\nconfidence in the justice of their cause and in the success of candid\r\ndiscussion and amicable negotiation with a just and friendly power; and\r\n\r\nWhereas a satisfactory adjustment, too long delayed, without the fault\r\nof the United States, has for some time been entirely suspended by\r\nevents over which they had no control; and\r\n\r\nWhereas a crisis has at length arrived subversive of the order of things\r\nunder the Spanish authorities, whereby a failure of the United States\r\nto take the said territory into its possession may lead to events\r\nultimately contravening the views of both parties, whilst in the\r\nmeantime the tranquillity and security of our adjoining territories are\r\nendangered and new facilities given to violations of our revenue and\r\ncommercial laws and of those prohibiting the introduction of slaves;\r\n\r\nConsidering, moreover, that under these peculiar and imperative\r\ncircumstances a forbearance on the part of the United States to occupy\r\nthe territory in question, and thereby guard against the confusions and\r\ncontingencies which threaten it, might be construed into a dereliction\r\nof their title or an insensibility to the importance of the stake;\r\nconsidering that in the hands of the United States it will not cease\r\nto be a subject of fair and friendly negotiation and adjustment;\r\nconsidering, finally, that the acts of Congress, though contemplating a\r\npresent possession by a foreign authority, have contemplated also an\r\neventual possession of the said territory by the United States, and are\r\naccordingly so framed as in that case to extend in their operation to\r\nthe same:\r\n\r\nNow be it known that I, James Madison, President of the United States of\r\nAmerica, in pursuance of these weighty and urgent considerations, have\r\ndeemed it right and requisite that possession should be taken of the\r\nsaid territory in the name and behalf of the United States. William\r\nC.C. Claiborne, governor of the Orleans Territory, of which the said\r\nTerritory is to be taken as part, will accordingly proceed to execute\r\nthe same and to exercise over the said Territory the authorities and\r\nfunctions legally appertaining to his office; and the good people\r\ninhabiting the same are invited and enjoined to pay due respect to him\r\nin that character, to be obedient to the laws, to maintain order, to\r\ncherish harmony, and in every manner to conduct themselves as peaceable\r\ncitizens, under full assurance that they will be protected in the\r\nenjoyment of their liberty, property, and religion.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have caused the seal of the United States to be\r\nhereunto affixed, and signed the same with my hand.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, the 27th day of October, A.D. 1810, and\r\nin the thirty-fifth year of the Independence of the said United States.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  R. SMITH,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From Annals of Congress, Eleventh Congress, third session, 1248.]\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas by the fourth section of the act of Congress passed on the 1st\r\nday of May, 1810, entitled \"An act concerning the commercial intercourse\r\nbetween the United States and Great Britain and France and their\r\ndependencies, and for other purposes,\" it is provided \"that in case\r\neither Great Britain or France shall before the 3d day of March next\r\nso revoke or modify her edicts as that they shall cease to violate the\r\nneutral commerce of the United States, which fact the President of the\r\nUnited States shall declare by proclamation, and if the other nation\r\nshall not within three months thereafter so revoke or modify her edicts\r\nin like manner, then the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth,\r\nninth, tenth, and eighteenth sections of the act entitled 'An act to\r\ninterdict the commercial intercourse between the United States and Great\r\nBritain and France and their dependencies, and for other purposes,'\r\nshall from and after the expiration of three months from the date of the\r\nproclamation aforesaid be revived and have full force and effect so far\r\nas relates to the dominions, colonies, and dependencies, and to the\r\narticles the growth, produce, or manufacture of the dominions, colonies,\r\nand dependencies, of the nation thus refusing or neglecting to revoke or\r\nmodify her edicts in the manner aforesaid. And the restrictions imposed\r\nby this act shall, from the date of such proclamation cease and be\r\ndiscontinued in relation to the nation revoking or modifying her decrees\r\nin the manner aforesaid;\" and\r\n\r\nWhereas it has been officially made known to this Government that the\r\nedicts of France violating the neutral commerce of the United States\r\nhave been so revoked as to cease to have effect on the 1st of the\r\npresent month:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, James Madison, President of the United States, do\r\nhereby proclaim that the said edicts of France have been so revoked as\r\nthat they ceased on the said 1st day of the present month to violate the\r\nneutral commerce of the United States, and that from the date of these\r\npresents all the restrictions imposed by the aforesaid act shall cease\r\nand be discontinued in relation to France and their dependencies.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have caused the seal of the United States to be\r\nhereunto affixed, and signed the same with my hand, at the city of\r\nWashington, this 2d day of November, A.D. 1810, and of the Independence\r\nof the United States the thirty-fifth.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  R. SMITH,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 5, 1810_.\r\n\r\n_Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe embarrassments which have prevailed in our foreign relations, and so\r\nmuch employed the deliberations of Congress, make it a primary duty in\r\nmeeting you to communicate whatever may have occurred in that branch of\r\nour national affairs.\r\n\r\nThe act of the last session of Congress concerning the commercial\r\nintercourse between the United States and Great Britain and France and\r\ntheir dependencies having invited in a new form a termination of their\r\nedicts against our neutral commerce, copies of the act were immediately\r\nforwarded to our ministers at London and Paris, with a view that its\r\nobject might be within the early attention of the French and British\r\nGovernments.\r\n\r\nBy the communication received through our minister at Paris it appeared\r\nthat a knowledge of the act by the French Government was followed by a\r\ndeclaration that the Berlin and Milan decrees were revoked, and would\r\ncease to have effect on the 1st day of November ensuing. These being the\r\nonly known edicts of France within the description of the act, and the\r\nrevocation of them being such that they ceased at that date to violate\r\nour neutral commerce, the fact, as prescribed by law, was announced by a\r\nproclamation bearing date the 2d day of November.\r\n\r\nIt would have well accorded with the conciliatory views indicated by\r\nthis proceeding on the part of France to have extended them to all the\r\ngrounds of just complaint which now remain unadjusted with the United\r\nStates. It was particularly anticipated that, as a further evidence of\r\njust dispositions toward them, restoration would have been immediately\r\nmade of the property of our citizens seized under a misapplication of\r\nthe principle of reprisals combined with a misconstruction of a law of\r\nthe United States. This expectation has not been fulfilled.\r\n\r\nFrom the British Government no communication on the subject of the act\r\nhas been received. To a communication from our minister at London of a\r\nrevocation by the French Government of its Berlin and Milan decrees it\r\nwas answered that the British system would be relinquished as soon as\r\nthe repeal of the French decrees should have actually taken effect and\r\nthe commerce of neutral nations have been restored to the condition in\r\nwhich it stood previously to the promulgation of those decrees. This\r\npledge, although it does not necessarily import, does not exclude the\r\nintention of relinquishing, along with the orders in council, the\r\npractice of those novel blockades which have a like effect of\r\ninterrupting our neutral commerce, and this further justice to the\r\nUnited States is the rather to be looked for, inasmuch as the blockades\r\nin question, being not more contrary to the established law of nations\r\nthan inconsistent with the rules of blockade formally recognized by\r\nGreat Britain herself, could have no alleged basis other than the plea\r\nof retaliation alleged as the basis of the orders in council. Under the\r\nmodification of the original orders of November, 1807, into the orders\r\nof April, 1809, there is, indeed, scarcely a nominal distinction between\r\nthe orders and the blockades. One of those illegitimate blockades,\r\nbearing date in May, 1806, having been expressly avowed to be still\r\nunrescinded, and to be in effect comprehended in the orders in council,\r\nwas too distinctly brought within the purview of the act of Congress not\r\nto be comprehended in the explanation of the requisites to a compliance\r\nwith it. The British Government was accordingly apprised by our minister\r\nnear it that such was the light in which the subject was to be regarded.\r\n\r\nOn the other important subjects depending between the United States and\r\nthat Government no progress has been made from which an early and\r\nsatisfactory result can be relied on.\r\n\r\nIn this new posture of our relations with those powers the consideration\r\nof Congress will be properly turned to a removal of doubts which may\r\noccur in the exposition and of difficulties in the execution of the act\r\nabove cited.\r\n\r\nThe commerce of the United States with the north of Europe, heretofore\r\nmuch vexed by licentious cruisers, particularly under the Danish flag,\r\nhas latterly been visited with fresh and extensive depredations. The\r\nmeasures pursued in behalf of our injured citizens not having obtained\r\njustice for them, a further and more formal interposition with the\r\nDanish Government is contemplated. The principles which have been\r\nmaintained by that Government in relation to neutral commerce, and the\r\nfriendly professions of His Danish Majesty toward the United States, are\r\nvaluable pledges in favor of a successful issue.\r\n\r\nAmong the events growing out of the state of the Spanish Monarchy, our\r\nattention was imperiously attracted to the change developing itself in\r\nthat portion of West Florida which, though of right appertaining to the\r\nUnited States, had remained in the possession of Spain awaiting the\r\nresult of negotiations for its actual delivery to them. The Spanish\r\nauthority was subverted and a situation produced exposing the country to\r\nulterior events which might essentially affect the rights and welfare of\r\nthe Union. In such a conjuncture I did not delay the interposition\r\nrequired for the occupancy of the territory west of the river Perdido,\r\nto which the title of the United States extends, and to which the laws\r\nprovided for the Territory of Orleans are applicable. With this view,\r\nthe proclamation of which a copy is laid before you was confided to the\r\ngovernor of that Territory to be carried into effect. The legality and\r\nnecessity of the course pursued assure me of the favorable light in\r\nwhich it will present itself to the Legislature, and of the promptitude\r\nwith which they will supply whatever provisions may be due to the\r\nessential rights and equitable interests of the people thus brought into\r\nthe bosom of the American family.\r\n\r\nOur amity with the powers of Barbary, with the exception of a recent\r\noccurrence at Tunis, of which an explanation is just received, appears\r\nto have been uninterrupted and to have become more firmly established.\r\n\r\nWith the Indian tribes also the peace and friendship of the United\r\nStates are found to be so eligible that the general disposition to\r\npreserve both continues to gain strength.\r\n\r\nI feel particular satisfaction in remarking that an interior view of our\r\ncountry presents us with grateful proofs of its substantial and\r\nincreasing prosperity. To a thriving agriculture and the improvements\r\nrelated to it is added a highly interesting extension of useful\r\nmanufactures, the combined product of professional occupations and of\r\nhousehold industry. Such indeed is the experience of economy as well as\r\nof policy in these substitutes for supplies heretofore obtained by\r\nforeign commerce that in a national view the change is justly regarded\r\nas of itself more than a recompense for those privations and losses\r\nresulting from foreign injustice which furnished the general impulse\r\nrequired for its accomplishment. How far it may be expedient to guard\r\nthe infancy of this improvement in the distribution of labor by\r\nregulations of the commercial tariff is a subject which can not fail to\r\nsuggest itself to your patriotic reflections.\r\n\r\nIt will rest with the consideration of Congress also whether a provident\r\nas well as fair encouragement would not be given to our navigation by\r\nsuch regulations as would place it on a level of competition with\r\nforeign vessels, particularly in transporting the important and bulky\r\nproductions of our own soil. The failure of equality and reciprocity in\r\nthe existing regulations on this subject operates in our ports as a\r\npremium to foreign competitors, and the inconvenience must increase as\r\nthese may be multiplied under more favorable circumstances by the more\r\nthan countervailing encouragements now given them by the laws of their\r\nrespective countries.\r\n\r\nWhilst it is universally admitted that a well-instructed people alone\r\ncan be permanently a free people, and whilst it is evident that the\r\nmeans of diffusing and improving useful knowledge form so small a\r\nproportion of the expenditures for national purposes, I can not presume\r\nit to be unseasonable to invite your attention to the advantages of\r\nsuperadding to the means of education provided by the several States a\r\nseminary of learning instituted by the National Legislature within the\r\nlimits of their exclusive jurisdiction, the expense of which might be\r\ndefrayed or reimbursed out of the vacant grounds which have accrued to\r\nthe nation within those limits.\r\n\r\nSuch an institution, though local in its legal character, would be\r\nuniversal in its beneficial effects. By enlightening the opinions, by\r\nexpanding the patriotism, and by assimilating the principles, the\r\nsentiments, and the manners of those who might resort to this temple of\r\nscience, to be redistributed in due time through every part of the\r\ncommunity, sources of jealousy and prejudice would be diminished, the\r\nfeatures of national character would be multiplied, and greater extent\r\ngiven to social harmony. But, above all, a well-constituted seminary in\r\nthe center of the nation is recommended by the consideration that the\r\nadditional instruction emanating from it would contribute not less to\r\nstrengthen the foundations than to adorn the structure of our free and\r\nhappy system of government.\r\n\r\nAmong the commercial abuses still committed under the American flag, and\r\nleaving in force my former reference to that subject, it appears that\r\nAmerican citizens are instrumental in carrying on a traffic in enslaved\r\nAfricans, equally in violation of the laws of humanity and in defiance\r\nof those of their own country. The same just and benevolent motives\r\nwhich produced the interdiction in force against this criminal conduct\r\nwill doubtless be felt by Congress in devising further means of\r\nsuppressing the evil.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of uncertainties necessarily connected with the great\r\ninterests of the United States, prudence requires a continuance of our\r\ndefensive and precautionary arrangement. The Secretary of War and\r\nSecretary of the Navy will submit the statements and estimates which may\r\naid Congress in their ensuing provisions for the land and naval forces.\r\nThe statements of the latter will include a view of the transfers of\r\nappropriations in the naval expenditures and the grounds on which they\r\nwere made.\r\n\r\nThe fortifications for the defense of our maritime frontier have been\r\nprosecuted according to the plan laid down in 1808. The works, with some\r\nexceptions, are completed and furnished with ordnance. Those for the\r\nsecurity of the city of New York, though far advanced toward completion,\r\nwill require a further time and appropriation. This is the case with a\r\nfew others, either not completed or in need of repairs.\r\n\r\nThe improvements in quality and quantity made in the manufacture of\r\ncannon and small arms, both at the public armories and private\r\nfactories, warrant additional confidence in the competency of these\r\nresources for supplying the public exigencies.\r\n\r\nThese preparations for arming the militia having thus far provided for\r\none of the objects contemplated by the power vested in Congress with\r\nrespect to that great bulwark of the public safety, it is for their\r\nconsideration whether further provisions are not requisite for the other\r\ncontemplated objects of organization and discipline. To give to this\r\ngreat mass of physical and moral force the efficiency which it merits,\r\nand is capable of receiving, it is indispensable that they should be\r\ninstructed and practiced in the rules by which they are to be governed.\r\nToward an accomplishment of this important work I recommend for the\r\nconsideration of Congress the expediency of instituting a system which\r\nshall in the first instance call into the field at the public expense\r\nand for a given time certain portions of the commissioned and\r\nnoncommissioned officers. The instruction and discipline thus acquired\r\nwould gradually diffuse through the entire body of the militia that\r\npractical knowledge and promptitude for active service which are the\r\ngreat ends to be pursued. Experience has left no doubt either of the\r\nnecessity or of the efficacy of competent military skill in those\r\nportions of an army in fitting it for the final duties which it may have\r\nto perform.\r\n\r\nThe Corps of Engineers, with the Military Academy, are entitled to the\r\nearly attention of Congress. The buildings at the seat fixed by law for\r\nthe present Academy are so far in decay as not to afford the necessary\r\naccommodation. But a revision of the law is recommended, principally\r\nwith a view to a more enlarged cultivation and diffusion of the\r\nadvantages of such institutions, by providing professorships for all the\r\nnecessary branches of military instruction, and by the establishment of\r\nan additional academy at the seat of Government or elsewhere. The means\r\nby which war, as well for defense as for offense, are now carried on\r\nrender these schools of the more scientific operations an indispensable\r\npart of every adequate system. Even among nations whose large standing\r\narmies and frequent wars afford every other opportunity of instruction\r\nthese establishments are found to be indispensable for the due\r\nattainment of the branches of military science which require a regular\r\ncourse of study and experiment. In a government happily without the\r\nother opportunities seminaries where the elementary principles of the\r\nart of war can be taught without actual war, and without the expense of\r\nextensive and standing armies, have the precious advantage of uniting an\r\nessential preparation against external danger with a scrupulous regard\r\nto internal safety. In no other way, probably, can a provision of equal\r\nefficacy for the public defense be made at so little expense or more\r\nconsistently with the public liberty.\r\n\r\nThe receipts into the Treasury during the year ending on the 30th of\r\nSeptember last (and amounting to more than $8,500,000) have exceeded the\r\ncurrent expenses of the Government, including the interest on the public\r\ndebt. For the purpose of reimbursing at the end of the year $3,750,000\r\nof the principal, a loan, as authorized by law, had been negotiated to\r\nthat amount, but has since been reduced to $2,750,000, the reduction\r\nbeing permitted by the state of the Treasury, in which there will be a\r\nbalance remaining at the end of the year estimated at $2,000,000. For\r\nthe probable receipts of the next year and other details I refer to\r\nstatements which will be transmitted from the Treasury, and which will\r\nenable you to judge what further provisions may be necessary for the\r\nensuing years.\r\n\r\nReserving for future occasions in the course of the session whatever\r\nother communications may claim your attention, I close the present by\r\nexpressing my reliance, under the blessing of Divine Providence, on the\r\njudgment and patriotism which will guide your measures at a period\r\nparticularly calling for united councils and inflexible exertions for\r\nthe welfare of our country, and by assuring you of the fidelity and\r\nalacrity with which my cooperation will be afforded.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 12, 1810.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI lay before Congress, and recommend to their early attention, a report\r\nof the Secretary of State, from which it will be seen that a very\r\nconsiderable demand beyond the legal appropriations has been incurred\r\nfor the support of seamen distressed by seizures, in different parts of\r\nEurope, of the vessels to which they belonged.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 3, 1811_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate to Congress, in confidence, a letter of the 2d of December\r\nfrom Governor Folch, of West Florida, to the Secretary of State, and\r\nanother of the same date from the same to John McKee.\r\n\r\nI communicate in like manner a letter from the British chargé d'affaires\r\nto the Secretary of State, with the answer of the latter. Although the\r\nletter can not have been written in consequence of any instruction from\r\nthe British Government founded on the late order for taking possession\r\nof the portion of West Florida well known to be claimed by the United\r\nStates; although no communication has ever been made by that Government\r\nto this of any stipulation with Spain contemplating an interposition\r\nwhich might so materially affect the United States, and although no call\r\ncan have been made by Spain in the present instance for the fulfillment\r\nof any such subsisting engagement, yet the spirit and scope of the\r\ndocument, with the accredited source from which it proceeds, required\r\nthat it should not be withheld from the consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nTaking into view the tenor of these several communications, the posture\r\nof things with which they are connected, the intimate relation of the\r\ncountry adjoining the United States eastward of the river Perdido to\r\ntheir security and tranquillity, and the peculiar interest they\r\notherwise have in its destiny, I recommend to the consideration of\r\nCongress the seasonableness of a declaration that the United States\r\ncould not see without serious inquietude any part of a neighboring\r\nterritory in which they have in different respects so deep and so just a\r\nconcern pass from the hands of Spain into those of any other foreign\r\npower.\r\n\r\nI recommend to their consideration also the expediency of authorizing\r\nthe Executive to take temporary possession of any part or parts of the\r\nsaid Territory, in pursuance of arrangements which may be desired by the\r\nSpanish authorities, and for making provision for the government of the\r\nsame during such possession.\r\n\r\nThe wisdom of Congress will at the same time determine how far it may be\r\nexpedient to provide for the event of a subversion of the Spanish\r\nauthorities within the Territory in question, and an apprehended\r\noccupancy thereof by any other foreign power.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 10, 1811.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate to Congress, in confidence, the translation of a letter\r\nfrom Louis de Onis to the captain general of Caraccas.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of misrepresentations and suggestions which it may be\r\ninferred from this specimen enter into more important correspondences of\r\nthe writer to promote in foreign councils at a critical period views\r\nadverse to the peace and to the best interests of our country renders\r\nthe contents of the letter of sufficient moment to be made known to the\r\nlegislature,\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 30, 1811.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress copies of a letter from the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, accompanied by copies of the Laws, Treaties, and other\r\nDocuments Relative to the Public Lands, as collected and arranged\r\npursuant to the act passed April 27, 1810.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 31, 1811.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI lay before Congress a letter from the chargé d'affaires of the United\r\nStates at Paris to the Secretary of State, and another from the same to\r\nthe French minister of foreign relations; also two letters from the\r\nagent of the American consul at Bordeaux to the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 16, 1811.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI now lay before Congress the treaty concluded on the 10th of November,\r\n1808, on the part of the United States with the Great and Little Osage\r\ntribes of Indians, with a view to such legal provisions as may be deemed\r\nproper for fulfilling its stipulations.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETO MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 21, 1811.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nHaving examined and considered the bill entitled \"An act incorporating\r\nthe Protestant Episcopal Church in the town of Alexandria, in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia,\" I now return the bill to the House of\r\nRepresentatives, in which it originated, with the following objections:\r\n\r\n_Because_ the bill exceeds the rightful authority to which\r\ngovernments are limited by the essential distinction between civil and\r\nreligious functions, and violates in particular the article of the\r\nConstitution of the United States which declares that \"Congress shall\r\nmake no law respecting a religious establishment.\" The bill enacts into\r\nand establishes by law sundry rules and proceedings relative purely to\r\nthe organization and polity of the church incorporated, and\r\ncomprehending even the election and removal of the minister of the same,\r\nso that no change could be made therein by the particular society or by\r\nthe general church of which it is a member, and whose authority it\r\nrecognizes. This particular church, therefore, would so far be a\r\nreligious establishment by law, a legal force and sanction being given\r\nto certain articles in its constitution and administration. Nor can it\r\nbe considered that the articles thus established are to be taken as the\r\ndescriptive criteria only of the corporate identity of the society,\r\ninasmuch as this identity must depend on other characteristics, as the\r\nregulations established are generally unessential and alterable\r\naccording to the principles and canons by which churches of that\r\ndenomination govern themselves, and as the injunctions and prohibitions\r\ncontained in the regulations would be enforced by the penal consequences\r\napplicable to a violation of them according to the local law.\r\n\r\n_Because_ the bill vests in the said incorporated church an\r\nauthority to provide for the support of the poor and the education of\r\npoor children of the same, an authority which, being altogether\r\nsuperfluous if the provision is to be the result of pious charity, would\r\nbe a precedent for giving to religious societies as such a legal agency\r\nin carrying into effect a public and civil duty.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 28, 1811.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nHaving examined and considered the bill entitled \"An act for the relief\r\nof Richard Tervin, William Coleman, Edwin Lewis, Samuel Mims, Joseph\r\nWilson, and the Baptist Church at Salem Meeting House, in the\r\nMississippi Territory,\" I now return the same to the House of\r\nRepresentatives, in which it originated, with the following objection:\r\n\r\n_Because_ the bill in reserving a certain parcel of land of the\r\nUnited States for the use of said Baptist Church comprises a principle\r\nand precedent for the appropriation of funds of the United States for\r\nthe use and support of religious societies, contrary to the article of\r\nthe Constitution which declares that \"Congress shall make no law\r\nrespecting a religious establishment.\"\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n[From the National Intelligencer, July 25, 1811]\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas great and weighty matters claiming the consideration of the\r\nCongress of the United States form an extraordinary occasion for\r\nconvening them, I do by these presents appoint Monday, the 4th day of\r\nNovember next, for their meeting at the city of Washington, hereby\r\nrequiring the respective Senators and Representatives then and there to\r\nassemble in Congress, in order to receive such communications as may\r\nthen be made to them, and to consult and determine on such measures as\r\nin their wisdom may be deemed meet for the welfare of the United States.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have caused the seal of the United States to be\r\nhereunto affixed, and signed the same with my hand, Done at the city of\r\nWashington, the 24th day of July, A.D. 1811, and of the Independence of\r\nthe United States the thirty-sixth.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  JAMES MONROE,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _November 5, 1811_.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn calling you together sooner than a separation from your homes would\r\notherwise have been required I yielded to considerations drawn from the\r\nposture of our foreign affairs, and in fixing the present for the time\r\nof your meeting regard was had to the probability of further\r\ndevelopments of the policy of the belligerent powers toward this country\r\nwhich might the more unite the national councils in the measures to be\r\npursued.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the last session of Congress it was hoped that the\r\nsuccessive confirmations of the extinction of the French decrees, so far\r\nas they violated our neutral commerce, would have induced the Government\r\nof Great Britain to repeal its orders in council, and thereby authorize\r\na removal of the existing obstructions to her commerce with the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nInstead of this reasonable step toward satisfaction and friendship\r\nbetween the two nations, the orders were, at a moment when least to have\r\nbeen expected, put into more rigorous execution; and it was communicated\r\nthrough the British envoy just arrived that whilst the revocation of the\r\nedicts of France, as officially made known to the British Government,\r\nwas denied to have taken place, it was an indispensable condition of the\r\nrepeal of the British orders that commerce should be restored to a\r\nfooting that would admit the productions and manufactures of Great\r\nBritain, when owned by neutrals, into markets shut against them by her\r\nenemy, the United States being given to understand that in the meantime\r\na continuance of their non importation act would lead to measures of\r\nretaliation.\r\n\r\nAt a later date it has indeed appeared that a communication to the\r\nBritish Government of fresh evidence of the repeal of the French decrees\r\nagainst our neutral trade was followed by an intimation that it had been\r\ntransmitted to the British plenipotentiary here in order that it might\r\nreceive full consideration in the depending discussions. This\r\ncommunication appears not to have been received; but the transmission of\r\nit hither, instead of founding on it an actual repeal of the orders or\r\nassurances that the repeal would ensue, will not permit us to rely on\r\nany effective change in the British cabinet. To be ready to meet with\r\ncordiality satisfactory proofs of such a change, and to proceed in the\r\nmeantime in adapting our measures to the views which have been disclosed\r\nthrough that minister will best consult our whole duty.\r\n\r\nIn the unfriendly spirit of those disclosures indemnity and redress for\r\nother wrongs have continued to be withheld, and our coasts and the\r\nmouths of our harbors have again witnessed scenes not less derogatory to\r\nthe dearest of our national rights than vexatious to the regular course\r\nof our trade.\r\n\r\nAmong the occurrences produced by the conduct of British ships of war\r\nhovering on our coasts was an encounter between one of them and the\r\nAmerican frigate commanded by Captain Rodgers, rendered unavoidable on\r\nthe part of the latter by a fire commenced without cause by the former,\r\nwhose commander is therefore alone chargeable with the blood\r\nunfortunately shed in maintaining the honor of the American flag. The\r\nproceedings of a court of inquiry requested by Captain Rodgers are\r\ncommunicated, together with the correspondence relating to the\r\noccurrence, between the Secretary of State and His Britannic Majesty's\r\nenvoy. To these are added the several correspondences which have passed\r\non the subject of the British orders in council, and to both the\r\ncorrespondence relating to the Floridas, in which Congress will be made\r\nacquainted with the interposition which the Government of Great Britain\r\nhas thought proper to make against the proceeding of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe justice and fairness which have been evinced on the part of the\r\nUnited States toward France, both before and since the revocation of her\r\ndecrees, authorized an expectation that her Government would have\r\nfollowed up that measure by all such others as were due to our\r\nreasonable claims, as well as dictated by its amicable professions. No\r\nproof, however, is yet given of an intention to repair the other wrongs\r\ndone to the United States, and particularly to restore the great amount\r\nof American property seized and condemned under edicts which, though not\r\naffecting our neutral relations, and therefore not entering into\r\nquestions between the United States and other belligerents, were\r\nnevertheless founded in such unjust principles that the reparation ought\r\nto have been prompt and ample.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this and other demands of strict right on that nation,\r\nthe United States have much reason to be dissatisfied with the rigorous\r\nand unexpected restrictions to which their trade with the French\r\ndominions has been subjected, and which, if not discontinued, will\r\nrequire at least corresponding restrictions on importations from France\r\ninto the United States.\r\n\r\nOn all those subjects our minister plenipotentiary lately sent to Paris\r\nhas carried with him the necessary instructions, the result of which\r\nwill be communicated to you, and, by ascertaining the ulterior policy of\r\nthe French Government toward the United States, Will enable you to adapt\r\nto it that of the United States toward France.\r\n\r\nOur other foreign relations remain without unfavorable changes. With\r\nRussia they are on the best footing of friendship. The ports of Sweden\r\nhave afforded proofs of friendly dispositions toward our commerce in the\r\ncouncils of that nation also, and the information from our special\r\nminister to Denmark shews that the mission had been attended with\r\nvaluable effects to our citizens, whose property had been so extensively\r\nviolated and endangered by cruisers under the Danish flag.\r\n\r\nUnder the ominous indications which commanded attention it became a duty\r\nto exert the means committed to the executive department in providing\r\nfor the general security. The works of defense on our maritime frontier\r\nhave accordingly been prosecuted with an activity leaving little to be\r\nadded for the completion of the most important ones, and, as\r\nparticularly suited for cooperation in emergencies, a portion of the\r\ngunboats have in particular harbors been ordered into use. The ships of\r\nwar before in commission, with the addition of a frigate, have been\r\nchiefly employed as a cruising guard to the rights of our coast, and\r\nsuch a disposition has been made of our land forces as was thought to\r\npromise the services most appropriate and important. In this disposition\r\nis included a force consisting of regulars and militia, embodied in the\r\nIndiana Territory and marched toward our northwestern frontier. This\r\nmeasure was made requisite by several murders and depredations committed\r\nby Indians, but more especially by the menacing preparations and aspect\r\nof a combination of them on the Wabash, under the influence and\r\ndirection of a fanatic of the Shawanese tribe. With these exceptions the\r\nIndian tribes retain their peaceable dispositions toward us, and their\r\nusual pursuits.\r\n\r\nI must now add that the period is arrived which claims from the\r\nlegislative guardians of the national rights a system of more ample\r\nprovisions for maintaining them. Notwithstanding the scrupulous justice,\r\nthe protracted moderation, and the multiplied efforts on the part of the\r\nUnited States to substitute for the accumulating dangers to the peace of\r\nthe two countries all the mutual advantages of reestablished friendship\r\nand confidence, we have seen that the British cabinet perseveres not\r\nonly in withholding a remedy for other wrongs, so long and so loudly\r\ncalling for it, but in the execution, brought home to the threshold of\r\nour territory, of measures which under existing circumstances have the\r\ncharacter as well as the effect of war on our lawful commerce.\r\n\r\nWith this evidence of hostile inflexibility in trampling on rights which\r\nno independent nation can relinquish, Congress will feel the duty of\r\nputting the United States into an armor and an attitude demanded by the\r\ncrisis, and corresponding with the national spirit and expectations.\r\n\r\nI recommend, accordingly, that adequate provision be made for filling\r\nthe ranks and prolonging the enlistments of the regular troops; for an\r\nauxiliary force to be engaged for a more limited term; for the\r\nacceptance of volunteer corps, whose patriotic ardor may court a\r\nparticipation in urgent services; for detachments as they may be wanted\r\nof other portions of the militia, and for such a preparation of the\r\ngreat body as will proportion its usefulness to its intrinsic\r\ncapacities. Nor can the occasion fail to remind you of the importance of\r\nthose military seminaries which in every event will form a valuable and\r\nfrugal part of our military establishment.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of cannon and small arms has proceeded with due success,\r\nand the stock and resources of all the necessary munitions are adequate\r\nto emergencies. It will not be inexpedient, however, for Congress to\r\nauthorize an enlargement of them.\r\n\r\nYour attention will of course be drawn to such provisions on the subject\r\nof our naval force as may be required for the services to which it may\r\nbe best adapted. I submit to Congress the seasonableness also of an\r\nauthority to augment the stock of such materials as are imperishable in\r\ntheir nature, or may not at once be attainable.\r\n\r\nIn contemplating the scenes which distinguish this momentous epoch, and\r\nestimating their claims to our attention, it is impossible to overlook\r\nthose developing themselves among the great communities which occupy the\r\nsouthern portion of our own hemisphere and extend into our neighborhood.\r\nAn enlarged philanthropy and an enlightened forecast concur in imposing\r\non the national councils an obligation to take a deep interest in their\r\ndestinies, to cherish reciprocal sentiments of good will, to regard the\r\nprogress of events, and not to be unprepared for whatever order of\r\nthings may be ultimately established.\r\n\r\nUnder another aspect of our situation the early attention of Congress\r\nwill be due to the expediency of further guards against evasions and\r\ninfractions of our commercial laws. The practice of smuggling, which is\r\nodious everywhere, and particularly criminal in free governments, where,\r\nthe laws being made by all for the good of all, a fraud is committed on\r\nevery individual as well as on the state, attains its utmost guilt when\r\nit blends with a pursuit of ignominious gain a treacherous subserviency,\r\nin the transgressors, to a foreign policy adverse to that of their own\r\ncountry. It is then that the virtuous indignation of the public should\r\nbe enabled to manifest itself through the regular animadversions of the\r\nmost competent laws.\r\n\r\nTo secure greater respect to our-mercantile flag, and to the honest\r\ninterests which it covers, it is expedient also that it be made\r\npunishable in our citizens to accept licenses from foreign governments\r\nfor a trade unlawfully interdicted by them to other American citizens,\r\nor to trade under false colors or papers of any sort.\r\n\r\nA prohibition is equally called for against the acceptance by our\r\ncitizens of special licenses to be used in a trade with the United\r\nStates, and against the admission into particular ports of the United\r\nStates of vessels from foreign countries authorized to trade with\r\nparticular ports only.\r\n\r\nAlthough other subjects will press more immediately on your\r\ndeliberations, a portion of them can not but be well bestowed on the\r\njust and sound policy of securing to our manufactures the success they\r\nhave attained, and are still attaining, in some degree, under the\r\nimpulse of causes not permanent, and to our navigation, the fair extent\r\nof which is at present abridged by the unequal regulations of foreign\r\ngovernments.\r\n\r\nBesides the reasonableness of saving our manufactures from sacrifices\r\nwhich a change of circumstances might bring on them, the national\r\ninterest requires that, with respect to such articles at least as belong\r\nto our defense and our primary wants, we should not be left in\r\nunnecessary dependence on external supplies. And whilst foreign\r\ngovernments adhere to the existing discriminations in their ports\r\nagainst our navigation, and an equality or lesser discrimination is\r\nenjoyed by their navigation in our ports, the effect can not be\r\nmistaken, because it has been seriously felt by our shipping interests;\r\nand in proportion as this takes place the advantages of an independent\r\nconveyance of our products to foreign markets and of a growing body of\r\nmariners trained by their occupations for the service of their country\r\nin times of danger must be diminished.\r\n\r\nThe receipts into the Treasury during the year ending on the 30th of\r\nSeptember last have exceeded $13,500,000, and have enabled us to defray\r\nthe current expenses, including the interest on the public debt, and to\r\nreimburse more than $5,000,000 of the principal without recurring to the\r\nloan authorized by the act of the last session. The temporary loan\r\nobtained in the latter end of the year 1810 has also been reimbursed,\r\nand is not included in that amount.\r\n\r\nThe decrease of revenue arising from the situation of our commerce, and\r\nthe extraordinary expenses which have and may become necessary, must be\r\ntaken into view in making commensurate provisions for the ensuing year;\r\nand I recommend to your consideration the propriety of insuring a\r\nsufficiency of annual revenue at least to defray the ordinary expenses\r\nof Government, and to pay the interest on the public debt, including\r\nthat on new loans which may be authorized.\r\n\r\nI can not close this communication without expressing my deep sense of\r\nthe crisis in which you are assembled, my confidence in a wise and\r\nhonorable result to your deliberations, and assurances of the faithful\r\nzeal with which my cooperating duties will be discharged, invoking at\r\nthe same time the blessing of Heaven on our beloved country and on all\r\nthe means that may be employed in vindicating its rights and advancing\r\nits welfare.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _November 13, 1811_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate to Congress copies of a correspondence between the envoy\r\nextraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of Great Britain and the\r\nSecretary of State relative to the aggression committed by a British\r\nship of war on the United States frigate _Chesapeake_, by which it\r\nwill be seen that that subject of difference between the two countries\r\nis terminated by an offer of reparation, which has been acceded to.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 18, 1811_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI lay before Congress two letters received from Governor Harrison, of\r\nthe Indiana Territory, reporting the particulars and the issue of the\r\nexpedition under his command, of which notice was taken in my\r\ncommunication of November 5.\r\n\r\nWhile it is deeply lamented that so many valuable lives have been lost\r\nin the action which took place on the 7th ultimo, Congress will see with\r\nsatisfaction the dauntless spirit and fortitude victoriously displayed\r\nby every description of the troops engaged, as well as the collected\r\nfirmness which distinguished their commander on an occasion requiring\r\nthe utmost exertions of valor and discipline.\r\n\r\nIt may reasonably be expected that the good effects of this critical\r\ndefeat and dispersion of a combination of savages, which appears to have\r\nbeen spreading to a greater extent, will be experienced not only in a\r\ncessation of the murders and depredations committed on our frontier, but\r\nin the prevention of any hostile incursions otherwise to have been\r\napprehended.\r\n\r\nThe families of those brave and patriotic citizens who have fallen in\r\nthis severe conflict will doubtless engage the favorable attention of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 23, 1811_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate to Congress copies of an act of the legislature of New\r\nYork relating to a canal from the Great Lakes to Hudson River. In making\r\nthe communication I consult the respect due to that State, in whose\r\nbehalf the commissioners appointed by the act have placed it in my hands\r\nfor the purpose.\r\n\r\nThe utility of canal navigation is universally admitted. It is no less\r\ncertain that scarcely any country offers more extensive opportunities\r\nfor that branch of improvements than the United States, and none,\r\nperhaps, inducements equally persuasive to make the most of them. The\r\nparticular undertaking contemplated by the State of New York, which\r\nmarks an honorable spirit of enterprise and comprises objects of\r\nnational as well as more limited importance, will recall the attention\r\nof Congress to the signal advantages to be derived to the United States\r\nfrom a general system of internal communication and conveyance, and\r\nsuggest to their consideration whatever steps may be proper on their\r\npart toward its introduction and accomplishment. As some of those\r\nadvantages have an intimate connection with the arrangements and\r\nexertions for the general security, it is at a period calling for those\r\nthat the merits of such a system will be seen in the strongest lights.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 27, 1811_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI lay before Congress copies of resolutions entered into by the\r\nlegislature of Pennsylvania, which have been transmitted to me with that\r\nview by the governor of that State, in pursuance of one of the said\r\nresolutions.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 15, 1812_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress an account of the contingent expenses of the\r\nGovernment for the year 1811, incurred on the occasion of taking\r\npossession of the territory limited eastwardly by the river Perdido,\r\nand amounting to $3,396.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 16, 1812_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate to Congress a letter from the envoy extraordinary and\r\nminister plenipotentiary of Great Britain to the Secretary of State,\r\nwith the answer of the latter.\r\n\r\nThe continued evidence afforded in this correspondence of the hostile\r\npolicy of the British Government against our national rights strengthens\r\nthe considerations recommending and urging the preparation of adequate\r\nmeans for maintaining them.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 3, 1812.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nAt the request of the convention assembled in the Territory of Orleans\r\non the 22d day of November last, I transmit to Congress the proceedings\r\nof that body in pursuance of the act entitled \"An act to enable the\r\npeople of the Territory of Orleans to form a constitution and State\r\ngovernment, and for the admission of the said State into the Union on an\r\nequal footing with the original States, and for other purposes.\"\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 9, 1812.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI lay before Congress copies of certain documents which remain in the\r\nDepartment of State. They prove that at a recent period, whilst the\r\nUnited States, notwithstanding the wrongs sustained by them, ceased not\r\nto observe the laws of peace and neutrality toward Great Britain, and in\r\nthe midst of amicable professions and negotiations on the part of the\r\nBritish Government, through its public minister here, a secret agent of\r\nthat Government was employed in certain States, more especially at the\r\nseat of government in Massachusetts, in fomenting disaffection to the\r\nconstituted authorities of the nation, and in intrigues with the\r\ndisaffected, for the purpose of bringing about resistance to the laws,\r\nand eventually, in concert with a British force, of destroying the Union\r\nand forming the eastern part thereof into a political connection with\r\nGreat Britain.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the effect which the discovery of such a procedure ought\r\nto have on the public councils, it will not fail to render more dear to\r\nthe hearts of all good citizens that happy union of these States which,\r\nunder Divine Providence, is the guaranty of their liberties, their\r\nsafety, their tranquillity, and their prosperity.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL 1, 1812.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nConsidering it as expedient, under existing circumstances and prospects,\r\nthat a general embargo be laid on all vessels now in port, or hereafter\r\narriving, for the period of sixty days, I recommend the immediate\r\npassage of a law to that effect.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL 20, 1812.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nAmong the incidents to the unexampled increase and expanding interests\r\nof the American nation under the fostering influence of free\r\nconstitutions and just laws has been a corresponding accumulation of\r\nduties in the several Departments of the Government, and this has been\r\nnecessarily the greater in consequence of the peculiar state of our\r\nforeign relations and the connection of these with our internal\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nThe extensive and multiplied preparations into which the United States\r\nare at length driven for maintaining their violated rights have caused\r\nthis augmentation of business to press on the Department of War\r\nparticularly, with a weight disproportionate to the powers of any single\r\nofficer, with no other aids than are authorized by existing laws. With a\r\nview to a more adequate arrangement for the essential objects of that\r\nDepartment, I recommend to the early consideration of Congress a\r\nprovision for two subordinate appointments therein, with such\r\ncompensations annexed as may be reasonably expected by citizens duly\r\nqualified for the important functions which may be properly assigned to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY 26, 1812.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate to Congress, for their information, copies and extracts\r\nfrom the correspondence of the Secretary of State and the minister\r\nplenipotentiary of the United States at Paris. These documents will\r\nplace before Congress the actual posture of our relations with France.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 1, 1812_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate to Congress certain documents, being a continuation of\r\nthose heretofore laid before them on the subject of our affairs with\r\nGreat Britain.\r\n\r\nWithout going back beyond the renewal in 1803 of the war in which\r\nGreat Britain is engaged, and omitting unrepaired wrongs of inferior\r\nmagnitude, the conduct of her Government presents a series of acts\r\nhostile to the United States as an independent and neutral nation.\r\n\r\nBritish cruisers have been in the continued practice of violating\r\nthe American flag on the great highway of nations, and of seizing\r\nand carrying off persons sailing under it, not in the exercise of a\r\nbelligerent right founded on the law of nations against an enemy, but\r\nof a municipal prerogative over British subjects. British jurisdiction\r\nis thus extended to neutral vessels in a situation where no laws can\r\noperate but the law of nations and the laws of the country to which the\r\nvessels belong, and a self-redress is assumed which, if British subjects\r\nwere wrongfully detained and alone concerned, is that substitution of\r\nforce for a resort to the responsible sovereign which falls within\r\nthe definition of war. Could the seizure of British subjects in such\r\ncases be regarded as within the exercise of a belligerent right, the\r\nacknowledged laws of war, which forbid an article of captured property\r\nto be adjudged without a regular investigation before a competent\r\ntribunal, would imperiously demand the fairest trial where the sacred\r\nrights of persons were at issue. In place of such a trial these rights\r\nare subjected to the will of every petty commander.\r\n\r\nThe practice, hence, is so far from affecting British subjects alone\r\nthat, under the pretext of searching for these, thousands of American\r\ncitizens, under the safeguard of public law and of their national flag,\r\nhave been torn from their country and from everything dear to them; have\r\nbeen dragged on board ships of war of a foreign nation and exposed,\r\nunder the severities of their discipline, to be exiled to the most\r\ndistant and deadly climes, to risk their lives in the battles of their\r\noppressors, and to be the melancholy instruments of taking away those of\r\ntheir own brethren.\r\n\r\nAgainst this crying enormity, which Great Britain would be so prompt\r\nto avenge if committed against herself, the United States have in vain\r\nexhausted remonstrances and expostulations, and that no proof might be\r\nwanting of their conciliatory dispositions, and no pretext left for a\r\ncontinuance of the practice, the British Government was formally assured\r\nof the readiness of the United States to enter into arrangements such as\r\ncould not be rejected if the recovery of British subjects were the real\r\nand the sole object. The communication passed without effect.\r\n\r\nBritish cruisers have been in the practice also of violating the rights\r\nand the peace of our coasts. They hover over and harass our entering and\r\ndeparting commerce. To the most insulting pretensions they have added\r\nthe most lawless proceedings in our very harbors, and have wantonly\r\nspilt American blood within the sanctuary of our territorial\r\njurisdiction. The principles and rules enforced by that nation, when\r\na neutral nation, against armed vessels of belligerents hovering near\r\nher coasts and disturbing her commerce are well known. When called on,\r\nnevertheless, by the United States to punish the greater offenses\r\ncommitted by her own vessels, her Government has bestowed on their\r\ncommanders additional marks of honor and confidence.\r\n\r\nUnder pretended blockades, without the presence of an adequate force and\r\nsometimes without the practicability of applying one, our commerce has\r\nbeen plundered in every sea, the great staples of our country have been\r\ncut off from their legitimate markets, and a destructive blow aimed\r\nat our agricultural and maritime interests. In aggravation of these\r\npredatory measures they have been considered as in force from the dates\r\nof their notification, a retrospective effect being thus added, as has\r\nbeen done in other important cases, to the unlawfulness of the course\r\npursued. And to render the outrage the more signal these mock blockades\r\nhave been reiterated and enforced in the face of official communications\r\nfrom the British Government declaring as the true definition of a legal\r\nblockade \"that particular ports must be actually invested and previous\r\nwarning given to vessels bound to them not to enter.\"\r\n\r\nNot content with these occasional expedients for laying waste our\r\nneutral trade, the cabinet of Britain resorted at length to the sweeping\r\nsystem of blockades, under the name of orders in council, which has\r\nbeen molded and managed as might best suit its political views, its\r\ncommercial jealousies, or the avidity of British cruisers.\r\n\r\nTo our remonstrances against the complicated and transcendent injustice\r\nof this innovation the first reply was that the orders were reluctantly\r\nadopted by Great Britain as a necessary retaliation on decrees of her\r\nenemy proclaiming a general blockade of the British Isles at a time when\r\nthe naval force of that enemy dared not issue from his own ports. She\r\nwas reminded without effect that her own prior blockades, unsupported by\r\nan adequate naval force actually applied and continued, were a bar to\r\nthis plea; that executed edicts against millions of our property could\r\nnot be retaliation on edicts confessedly impossible to be executed; that\r\nretaliation, to be just, should fall on the party setting the guilty\r\nexample, not on an innocent party which was not even chargeable with an\r\nacquiescence in it.\r\n\r\nWhen deprived of this flimsy veil for a prohibition of our trade with\r\nher enemy by the repeal of his prohibition of our trade with Great\r\nBritain, her cabinet, instead of a corresponding repeal or a practical\r\ndiscontinuance of its orders, formally avowed a determination to persist\r\nin them against the United States until the markets of her enemy should\r\nbe laid open to British products, thus asserting an obligation on a\r\nneutral power to require one belligerent to encourage by its internal\r\nregulations the trade of another belligerent, contradicting her own\r\npractice toward all nations, in peace as well as in war, and betraying\r\nthe insincerity of those professions which inculcated a belief that,\r\nhaving resorted to her orders with regret, she was anxious to find an\r\noccasion for putting an end to them.\r\n\r\nAbandoning still more all respect for the neutral rights of the United\r\nStates and for its own consistency, the British Government now demands\r\nas prerequisites to a repeal of its orders as they relate to the United\r\nStates that a formality should be observed in the repeal of the French\r\ndecrees nowise necessary to their termination nor exemplified by British\r\nusage, and that the French repeal, besides including that portion of the\r\ndecrees which operates within a territorial jurisdiction, as well as\r\nthat which operates on the high seas, against the commerce of the United\r\nStates should not be a single and special repeal in relation to the\r\nUnited States, but should be extended to whatever other neutral nations\r\nunconnected with them may be affected by those decrees. And as an\r\nadditional insult, they are called on for a formal disavowal of\r\nconditions and pretensions advanced by the French Government for which\r\nthe United States are so far from having made themselves responsible\r\nthat, in official explanations which have been published to the world,\r\nand in a correspondence of the American minister at London with the\r\nBritish minister for foreign affairs such a responsibility was\r\nexplicitly and emphatically disclaimed.\r\n\r\nIt has become, indeed, sufficiently certain that the commerce of\r\nthe United States is to be sacrificed, not as interfering with the\r\nbelligerent rights of Great Britain; not as supplying the wants of\r\nher enemies, which she herself supplies; but as interfering with the\r\nmonopoly which she covets for her own commerce and navigation. She\r\ncarries on a war against the lawful commerce of a friend that she may\r\nthe better carry on a commerce with an enemy--a commerce polluted by the\r\nforgeries and perjuries which are for the most part the only passports\r\nby which it can succeed.\r\n\r\nAnxious to make every experiment short of the last resort of injured\r\nnations, the United States have withheld from Great Britain, under\r\nsuccessive modifications, the benefits of a free intercourse with their\r\nmarket, the loss of which could not but outweigh the profits accruing\r\nfrom her restrictions of our commerce with other nations. And to entitle\r\nthese experiments to the more favorable consideration they were so\r\nframed as to enable her to place her adversary under the exclusive\r\noperation of them. To these appeals her Government has been equally\r\ninflexible, as if willing to make sacrifices of every sort rather than\r\nyield to the claims of justice or renounce the errors of a false pride.\r\nNay, so far were the attempts carried to overcome the attachment\r\nof the British cabinet to its unjust edicts that it received every\r\nencouragement within the competency of the executive branch of our\r\nGovernment to expect that a repeal of them would be followed by a war\r\nbetween the United States and France, unless the French edicts should\r\nalso be repealed. Even this communication, although silencing forever\r\nthe plea of a disposition in the United States to acquiesce in those\r\nedicts originally the sole plea for them, received no attention.\r\n\r\nIf no other proof existed of a predetermination of the British\r\nGovernment against a repeal of its orders, it might be found in the\r\ncorrespondence of the minister plenipotentiary of the United States at\r\nLondon and the British secretary for foreign affairs in 1810, on the\r\nquestion whether the blockade of May, 1806, was considered as in force\r\nor as not in force. It had been ascertained that the French Government,\r\nwhich urged this blockade as the ground of its Berlin decree, was\r\nwilling in the event of its removal to repeal that decree, which, being\r\nfollowed by alternate repeals of the other offensive edicts, might\r\nabolish the whole system on both sides. This inviting opportunity for\r\naccomplishing an object so important to the United States, and professed\r\nso often to be the desire of both the belligerents, was made known\r\nto the British Government. As that Government admits that an actual\r\napplication of an adequate force is necessary to the existence of a\r\nlegal blockade, and it was notorious that if such a force had ever been\r\napplied its long discontinuance had annulled the blockade in question,\r\nthere could be no sufficient objection on the part of Great Britain to a\r\nformal revocation of it, and no imaginable objection to a declaration of\r\nthe fact that the blockade did not exist. The declaration would have\r\nbeen consistent with her avowed principles of blockade, and would have\r\nenabled the United States to demand from France the pledged repeal of\r\nher decrees, either with success, in which case the way would have\r\nbeen opened for a general repeal of the belligerent edicts, or without\r\nsuccess, in which case the United States would have been justified\r\nin turning their measures exclusively against France. The British\r\nGovernment would, however, neither rescind the blockade nor declare its\r\nnonexistence, nor permit its nonexistence to be inferred and affirmed\r\nby the American plenipotentiary. On the contrary, by representing the\r\nblockade to be comprehended in the orders in council, the United States\r\nwere compelled so to regard it in their subsequent proceedings.\r\n\r\nThere was a period when a favorable change in the policy of the\r\nBritish cabinet was justly considered as established. The minister\r\nplenipotentiary of His Britannic Majesty here proposed an adjustment of\r\nthe differences more immediately endangering the harmony of the two\r\ncountries. The proposition was accepted with the promptitude and\r\ncordiality corresponding with the invariable professions of this\r\nGovernment. A foundation appeared to be laid for a sincere and lasting\r\nreconciliation. The prospect, however, quickly vanished. The whole\r\nproceeding was disavowed by the British Government without any\r\nexplanations which could at that time repress the belief that the\r\ndisavowal proceeded from a spirit of hostility to the commercial rights\r\nand prosperity of the United States; and it has since come into proof\r\nthat at the very moment when the public minister was holding the\r\nlanguage of friendship and inspiring confidence in the sincerity of the\r\nnegotiation with which he was charged a secret agent of his Government\r\nwas employed in intrigues having for their object a subversion of our\r\nGovernment and a dismemberment of our happy union.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the conduct of Great Britain toward the United States\r\nour attention is necessarily drawn to the warfare just renewed by the\r\nsavages on one of our extensive frontiers--a warfare which is known to\r\nspare neither age nor sex and to be distinguished by features peculiarly\r\nshocking to humanity. It is difficult to account for the activity and\r\ncombinations which have for some time been developing themselves among\r\ntribes in constant intercourse with British traders and garrisons\r\nwithout connecting their hostility with that influence and without\r\nrecollecting the authenticated examples of such interpositions\r\nheretofore furnished by the officers and agents of that Government.\r\n\r\nSuch is the spectacle of injuries and indignities which have been heaped\r\non our country, and such the crisis which its unexampled forbearance and\r\nconciliatory efforts have not been able to avert. It might at least\r\nhave been expected that an enlightened nation, if less urged by moral\r\nobligations or invited by friendly dispositions on the part of the\r\nUnited States, would have found in its true interest alone a sufficient\r\nmotive to respect their rights and their tranquillity on the high\r\nseas; that an enlarged policy would have favored that free and general\r\ncirculation of commerce in which the British nation is at all times\r\ninterested, and which in times of war is the best alleviation of its\r\ncalamities to herself as well as to other belligerents; and more\r\nespecially that the British cabinet would not, for the sake of a\r\nprecarious and surreptitious intercourse with hostile markets, have\r\npersevered in a course of measures which necessarily put at hazard the\r\ninvaluable market of a great and growing country, disposed to cultivate\r\nthe mutual advantages of an active commerce.\r\n\r\nOther counsels have prevailed. Our moderation and conciliation have\r\nhad no other effect than to encourage perseverance and to enlarge\r\npretensions. We behold our seafaring citizens still the daily victims of\r\nlawless violence, committed on the great common and highway of nations,\r\neven within sight of the country which owes them protection. We behold\r\nour vessels, freighted with the products of our soil and industry, or\r\nreturning with the honest proceeds of them, wrested from their lawful\r\ndestinations, confiscated by prize courts no longer the organs of public\r\nlaw but the instruments of arbitrary edicts, and their unfortunate crews\r\ndispersed and lost, or forced or inveigled in British ports into British\r\nfleets, whilst arguments are employed in support of these aggressions\r\nwhich have no foundation but in a principle equally supporting a claim\r\nto regulate our external commerce in all cases whatsoever.\r\n\r\nWe behold, in fine, on the side of Great Britain a state of war against\r\nthe United States, and on the side of the United States a state of peace\r\ntoward Great Britain.\r\n\r\nWhether the United States shall continue passive under these progressive\r\nusurpations and these accumulating wrongs, or, opposing force to force\r\nin defense of their national rights, shall commit a just cause into\r\nthe hands of the Almighty Disposer of Events, avoiding all connections\r\nwhich might entangle it in the contest or views of other powers,\r\nand preserving a constant readiness to concur in an honorable\r\nreestablishment of peace and friendship, is a solemn question which\r\nthe Constitution wisely confides to the legislative department of the\r\nGovernment. In recommending it to their early deliberations I am happy\r\nin the assurance that the decision will be worthy the enlightened and\r\npatriotic councils of a virtuous, a free, and a powerful nation.\r\n\r\nHaving presented this view of the relations of the United States with\r\nGreat Britain and of the solemn alternative growing out of them, I\r\nproceed to remark that the communications last made to Congress on the\r\nsubject of our relations with France will have shewn that since the\r\nrevocation of her decrees, as they violated the neutral rights of the\r\nUnited States, her Government has authorized illegal captures by its\r\nprivateers and public ships, and that other outrages have been practiced\r\non our vessels and our citizens. It will have been seen also that no\r\nindemnity had been provided or satisfactorily pledged for the extensive\r\nspoliations committed under the violent and retrospective orders of the\r\nFrench Government against the property of our citizens seized within the\r\njurisdiction of France. I abstain at this time from recommending to the\r\nconsideration of Congress definitive measures with respect to that\r\nnation, in the expectation that the result of unclosed discussions\r\nbetween our minister plenipotentiary at Paris and the French Government\r\nwill speedily enable Congress to decide with greater advantage on the\r\ncourse due to the rights, the interests, and the honor of our country.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNE 30, 1812.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nWith a view the better to adapt to the public service the volunteer\r\nforce contemplated by the act passed on the 6th day of February, I\r\nrecommend to the consideration of Congress the expediency of making the\r\nrequisite provision for the officers thereof being commissioned by the\r\nauthority of the United States.\r\n\r\nConsidering the distribution of the military forces of the United States\r\nrequired by the circumstances of our country, I recommend also to the\r\nconsideration of Congress the expediency of providing for the\r\nappointment of an additional number of general officers, and of deputies\r\nin the Adjutant's, Quartermaster's, Inspector's, and Paymaster's\r\ndepartments of the Army, and for the employment in cases of emergency of\r\nadditional engineers.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJULY 1, 1812.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n26th of June, I transmit the information contained in the documents\r\nherewith enclosed.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_From the Secretary of State to General George Matthews and Colonel\r\nJohn M'Kee_.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE, _January 26, 1811_.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States having appointed you jointly and\r\nseverally commissioners for carrying into effect certain provisions of\r\nan act of Congress (a copy of which is inclosed) relative to the portion\r\nof the Floridas situated to the east of the river Perdido, you will\r\nrepair to that quarter with all possible expedition, concealing from\r\ngeneral observation the trust committed to you with that discretion\r\nwhich the delicacy and importance of the undertaking require.\r\n\r\nShould you find Governor Folk or the local authority existing there\r\ninclined to surrender in an amicable manner the possession of the\r\nremaining portion or portions of West Florida now held by him in the\r\nname of the Spanish Monarchy, you are to accept in behalf of the United\r\nStates the abdication of his or of the other existing authority and the\r\njurisdiction of the country over which it extends. And should a\r\nstipulation be insisted on for the redelivery of the country at a future\r\nperiod, you may engage for such redelivery to the lawful sovereign.\r\n\r\nThe debts clearly due from the Spanish Government to the people of the\r\nTerritory surrendered may, if insisted on, be assumed within reasonable\r\nlimits and under specified descriptions to be settled hereafter as a\r\nclaim against Spain in an adjustment of our affairs with her. You may\r\nalso guarantee, in the name of the United States, the confirmation of\r\nall such titles to land as are clearly sanctioned by Spanish laws, and\r\nSpanish civil functionaries, where no special reasons may require\r\nchanges, are to be permitted to remain in office with the assurance of a\r\ncontinuation of the prevailing laws, with such alterations only as may\r\nbe necessarily required in the new situation of the country.\r\n\r\nIf it should be required and be found necessary, you may agree to\r\nadvance, as above, a reasonable sum for the transportation of the\r\nSpanish troops.\r\n\r\nThese directions are adapted to one of the contingencies specified in\r\nthe act of Congress, namely, the amicable surrender of the possession of\r\nthe Territory by the local ruling authority. But should the arrangement\r\ncontemplated by the statute not be made, and should there be room to\r\nentertain a suspicion of an existing design in any foreign power to\r\noccupy the country in question, you are to keep yourselves on the alert,\r\nand on the first undoubted manifestation of the approach of a force for\r\nthat purpose you will exercise with promptness and vigor the powers with\r\nwhich you are invested by the President to preoccupy by force the\r\nTerritory, to the entire exclusion of any armament that may be advancing\r\nto take the possession of it. In this event you will exercise a sound\r\ndiscretion in applying the powers given with respect to debts, titles to\r\nlands, civil officers, and the continuation of the Spanish laws, taking\r\ncare to commit the Government on no point further than may be necessary;\r\nand should any Spanish military force remain within the country after\r\nthe occupancy by the troops of the United States, you may in such case\r\naid in their removal from the same.\r\n\r\nThe universal toleration which the laws of the United States assure to\r\nevery religious persuasion will not escape you as an argument for\r\nquieting the minds of uninformed individuals who may entertain fears on\r\nthat head.\r\n\r\nThe conduct you are to pursue in regard to East Florida must be\r\nregulated by the dictates of your own judgments, on a close view and\r\naccurate knowledge of the precise state of things there, and of the real\r\ndisposition of the Spanish Government always recurring to the present\r\ninstruction as the paramount rule of your proceedings. Should you\r\ndiscover an inclination in the governor of East Florida, or in the\r\nexisting local authority, amicably to surrender that province into the\r\npossession of the United States, you are to accept it on the same terms\r\nthat are prescribed by these instructions in relation to West Florida.\r\nAnd in case of the actual appearance of any attempt to take possession\r\nby a foreign power, you will pursue the same effective measures for the\r\noccupation of the Territory and for the exclusion of the foreign force\r\nas you are directed to pursue with respect to the country east of the\r\nPerdido, forming at this time the extent of Governor Folk's\r\njurisdiction.\r\n\r\nIf you should, under these instructions, obtain possession of Mobile,\r\nyou will lose no time in informing Governor Claiborne thereof, with a\r\nrequest that he will without delay take the necessary steps for the\r\noccupation of the same.\r\n\r\nAll ordnance and military stores that may be found in the Territory must\r\nbe held as the property of the Spanish Government, to be accounted for\r\nhereafter to the proper authority, and you will not fail to transmit an\r\ninventory thereof to this Department.\r\n\r\nIf in the execution of any part of these instructions you should need\r\nthe aid of a military force, the same will be afforded you upon your\r\napplication to the commanding officer of the troops of the United States\r\non that station, or to the commanding officer of the nearest post, in\r\nvirtue of orders which have been issued from the War Department. And in\r\ncase you should, moreover, need naval assistance, you will receive the\r\nsame upon your application to the naval commander in pursuance of orders\r\nfrom the Navy Department.\r\n\r\nFrom the Treasury Department will be issued the necessary instructions\r\nin relation to imposts and duties, and to the slave ships whose arrival\r\nis apprehended.\r\n\r\nThe President, relying upon your discretion, authorizes you to draw upon\r\nthe collectors of Orleans and Savannah for such sums as may be necessary\r\nto defray unavoidable expenses that may be incurred in the execution of\r\nthese instructions, not exceeding in your drafts on New Orleans $8,000\r\nand in your drafts on Savannah $2,000, without further authority, of\r\nwhich expenses you will hereafter exhibit a detailed account duly\r\nsupported by satisfactory vouchers.\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT.--If Governor Folk should unexpectedly require and\r\npertinaciously insist that the stipulation for the redelivery of the\r\nTerritory should also include that portion of the country which is\r\nsituated west of the river Perdido, you are, in yielding to such demand,\r\nonly to use general words that may by implication comprehend that\r\nportion of country; but at the same time you are expressly to provide\r\nthat such stipulation shall not in any way impair or affect the right or\r\ntitle of the United States to the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Secretary of State to General Matthews_.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE, _April 4, 1812_.\r\n\r\nGeneral MATTHEWS, etc.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have had the honor to receive your letter of the 14th of March,\r\nand have now to communicate to you the sentiments of the President on\r\nthe very interesting subject to which it relates.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to have to state that the measures which you appear to have\r\nadopted for obtaining possession of Amelia Island and other parts of\r\nBast Florida are not authorized by the law of the United States or the\r\ninstructions founded on it under which you have acted.\r\n\r\nYou were authorized by the law, a copy of which was communicated to you,\r\nand by your instructions, which are strictly conformable to it, to take\r\npossession of East Florida only in case one of the following contingencies\r\nshould happen: Either that the governor or other existing local\r\nauthority should be disposed to place it amicably in the hands of the\r\nUnited States, or that an attempt should be made to, take possession\r\nof it by a foreign power. Should the first contingency happen it would\r\nfollow that the arrangement, being amicable, would require no force on\r\nthe part of the United States to carry it into effect. It was only in\r\ncase of an attempt to take it by a foreign power that force could be\r\nnecessary, in which event only were you authorized to avail yourself\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nIn neither of these contingencies was it the policy of the law or\r\npurpose of the Executive to wrest the Province forcibly from Spain,\r\nbut only to occupy it with a view to prevent its falling into the\r\nhands of any foreign power, and to hold that pledge under the existing\r\npeculiarity of the circumstances of the Spanish Monarchy for a just\r\nresult in an amicable negotiation with Spain.\r\n\r\nHad the United States been disposed to proceed otherwise, that intention\r\nwould have been manifested by a change of the law and suitable measures\r\nto carry it into effect; and as it was in their power to take possession\r\nwhenever they might think that circumstances authorized and required it,\r\nit would be the more to be regretted if possession should be effected by\r\nany means irregular in themselves and subjecting the Government of the\r\nUnited States to unmerited censure.\r\n\r\nThe views of the Executive respecting East Florida are further\r\nillustrated by your instructions as to West Florida. Although the United\r\nStates have thought that they had a good title to the latter Province,\r\nthey did not take possession until after the Spanish authority had been\r\nsubverted by a revolutionary proceeding, and the contingency of the\r\ncountry being thrown into foreign hands had forced itself into view. Nor\r\ndid they then, nor have they since, dispossessed the Spanish troops of\r\nthe post which they occupied. If they did not think proper to take\r\npossession by force of a province to which they thought they were justly\r\nentitled, it could not be presumed that they should intend to act\r\ndifferently in respect to one to which they had not such a claim.\r\n\r\nI may add that although due sensibility has been always felt for the\r\ninjuries which were received from the Spanish Government in the last\r\nwar, the present situation of Spain has been a motive for a moderate and\r\npacific policy toward her.\r\n\r\nIn communicating to you these sentiments of the Executive on the\r\nmeasures you have lately adopted for taking possession of East Florida,\r\nI add with pleasure that the utmost confidence is reposed in your\r\nintegrity and zeal to promote the welfare of your country. To that zeal\r\nthe error into which you have fallen is imputed. But in consideration of\r\nthe part which you have taken, which differs so essentially from that\r\ncontemplated and authorized by the Government, and contradicts so\r\nentirely the principles on which it has uniformly and sincerely acted,\r\nyou will be sensible of the necessity of discontinuing the service in\r\nwhich you have been employed.\r\n\r\nYou will therefore consider your powers as revoked on the receipt of\r\nthis letter. The new duties to be performed will be transferred to the\r\ngovernor of Georgia, to whom instructions will be given on all the\r\ncircumstances to which it may be proper at the present juncture to call\r\nhis attention.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, very respectfully, sir, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Secretary of State to His Excellency D.B. Mitchell, the\r\ngovernor of Georgia_.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE, _April 10, 1812_.\r\n\r\nSIR: The President is desirous of availing the public of your services\r\nin a concern of much delicacy and of high importance to the United\r\nStates. Circumstances with which you are in some degree acquainted, but\r\nwhich will be fully explained by the inclosed papers, have made it\r\nnecessary to revoke the powers heretofore committed to General Matthews\r\nand to commit them to you. The President is persuaded that you will not\r\nhesitate to undertake a trust so important to the nation, and peculiarly\r\nto the State of Georgia. He is the more confident in this belief from\r\nthe consideration that these new duties may be discharged without\r\ninterfering, as he presumes, with those of the station which you now\r\nhold.\r\n\r\nBy the act of the 15th of January, 1811, you will observe that it was\r\nnot contemplated to take possession of East Florida or any part thereof,\r\nunless it should be surrendered to the United States amicably by the\r\ngovernor or other local authority of the Province, or against an attempt\r\nto take possession of it by a foreign power, and you will also see that\r\nGeneral Matthews's instructions, of which a copy is likewise inclosed,\r\ncorrespond fully with the law.\r\n\r\nBy the documents in possession of the Government it appears that neither\r\nof these contingencies have happened; that instead of an amicable\r\nsurrender by the governor or other local authority the troops of the\r\nUnited States have been used to dispossess the Spanish authority by\r\nforce. I forbear to dwell on the details of this transaction because it\r\nis painful to recite them. By the letter to General Matthews which is\r\ninclosed, open for your perusal, you will fully comprehend the views of\r\nthe Government respecting the late transaction, and by the law, the\r\nformer instructions to the General, and the late letter now forwarded\r\nyou will be made acquainted with the course of conduct which it is\r\nexpected of you to pursue in future in discharging the duties heretofore\r\nenjoined on him.\r\n\r\nIt is the desire of the President that you should turn your attention\r\nand direct your efforts in the first instance to the restoration of that\r\nstate of things in the Province which existed before the late\r\ntransactions. The Executive considers it proper to restore back to the\r\nSpanish authorities Amelia Island and such other parts, if any, of East\r\nFlorida as may have thus been taken from them. With this view it will be\r\nnecessary for you to communicate _directly_ with the governor or\r\nprincipal officer of Spain in that Province, and to act in harmony with\r\nhim in the attainment of it. It is presumed that the arrangement will be\r\neasily and amicably made between you. I inclose you an order from the\r\nSecretary of War to the commander of the troops of the United States to\r\nevacuate the country when requested so to do by you, and to pay the same\r\nrespect in future to your order in fulfilling the duties enjoined by the\r\nlaw that he had been instructed to do to that of General Matthews.\r\n\r\nIn restoring to the Spanish authorities Amelia Island and such other\r\nparts of East Florida as may have been taken possession of in the name\r\nof the United States there is another object to which your particular\r\nattention will be due. In the measures lately adopted by General\r\nMatthews to take possession of that Territory it is probable that much\r\nreliance has been placed by the people who acted in it on the\r\ncountenance and support of the United States. It will be improper to\r\nexpose these people to the resentment of the Spanish authorities. It is\r\nnot to be presumed that those authorities in regaining possession of the\r\nTerritory in this amicable mode from the United States will be disposed\r\nto indulge any such feeling toward them. You will, however, come to a\r\nfull understanding with the Spanish governor on this subject, and not\r\nfail to obtain from him the most explicit and satisfactory assurance\r\nrespecting it. Of this assurance you will duly apprise the parties\r\ninterested, and of the confidence which you repose in it. It is hoped\r\nthat on this delicate and very interesting point the Spanish governor\r\nwill avail himself of the opportunity it presents to evince the friendly\r\ndisposition of his Government toward the United States.\r\n\r\nThere is one other remaining circumstance only to which I wish to call\r\nyour attention, and that relates to General Matthews himself. His\r\ngallant and meritorious services in our Revolution and patriotic conduct\r\nsince have always been held in high estimation by the Government. His\r\nerrors in this instance are imputed altogether to his zeal to promote\r\nthe welfare of his country; but they are of a nature to impose on the\r\nGovernment the necessity of the measures now taken, in giving effect to\r\nwhich you will doubtless feel a disposition to consult, as far as may\r\nbe, his personal sensibility.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, etc.,\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Should you find it impracticable to execute the duties designated\r\nabove in person, the President requests that you will be so good as to\r\nemploy some very respectable character to represent you in it, to whom\r\nyou are authorized to allow a similar compensation. It is hoped,\r\nhowever, that you may be able to attend to it in person, for reasons\r\nwhich I need not enter into. The expenses to which you may be exposed\r\nwill be promptly paid to your draft on this Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Secretary of State to D.B. Mitchell, esq., governor of Georgia_.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE, _May 27, 1812_.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have had the honor to receive your letter of the 2d instant from\r\nSt. Marys, where you had arrived in discharge of the trust reposed in\r\nyou by the President, in relation to East Florida.\r\n\r\nMy letter by Mr. Isaacs has, I presume, substantially answered the most\r\nimportant of the queries submitted in your letter, but I will give to\r\neach a more distinct answer.\r\n\r\nBy the law of which a copy was forwarded to you it is made the duty of\r\nthe President to prevent the occupation of East Florida by any foreign\r\npower. It follows that you are authorized to consider the entrance, or\r\nattempt to enter, especially under existing circumstances, of British\r\ntroops of any description as the case contemplated by the law, and to\r\nuse the proper means to defeat it.\r\n\r\nAn instruction will be immediately forwarded to the commander of the\r\nnaval force of the United States in the neighborhood of East Florida to\r\ngive you any assistance, in case of emergency, which you may think\r\nnecessary and require.\r\n\r\nIt is not expected, if you find it proper to withdraw the troops, that\r\nyou should interfere to compel the patriots to surrender the country or\r\nany part of it to the Spanish authorities. The United States are\r\nresponsible for their own conduct only; not for that of the inhabitants\r\nof East Florida. Indeed, in consequence of the compromitment of the\r\nUnited States to the inhabitants, you have been already instructed not\r\nto withdraw the troops, unless you find that it may be done consistently\r\nwith their safety, and to report to the Government the result of your\r\nconferences with the Spanish authorities, with your opinion of their\r\nviews, holding in the meantime the ground occupied.\r\n\r\nIn the present state of our affairs with Great Britain the course above\r\npointed out is the more justifiable and proper.\r\n\r\nI have the honor, etc.,\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJULY 6, 1812.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate copies and extracts of documents in the\r\narchives of the Department of State falling within the purview of their\r\nresolution of the 4th instant, on the subject of British impressments\r\nfrom American vessels. The information, though voluminous, might have\r\nbeen enlarged with more time for research and preparation. In some\r\ninstances it might at the same time have been abridged but for the\r\ndifficulty of separating the matter extraneous to the immediate object\r\nof the resolution.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETO MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL 3, 1812.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nHaving examined and considered the bill entitled \"An act providing for\r\nthe trial of causes pending in the respective district courts of the\r\nUnited States, in case of the absence or disability of the judges\r\nthereof,\" which bill was presented to me on the 25th of March past, I\r\nnow return the same to the House of Representatives, in which it\r\noriginated, with the following objections:\r\n\r\nBecause the additional services imposed by the bill on the justices of\r\nthe Supreme Court of the United States are to be performed by them\r\nrather in the quality of other judges of other courts, namely, judges of\r\nthe district courts, than in the quality of justices of the Supreme\r\nCourt. They are to hold the said district courts, and to do and perform\r\nall acts relating to the said courts which are by law required of the\r\ndistrict judges. The bill therefore virtually appoints, for the time,\r\nthe justices of the Supreme Court to other distinct offices to which, if\r\ncompatible with their original offices, they ought to be appointed by\r\nanother than the legislative authority, in pursuance of legislative\r\nprovisions authorizing the appointments.\r\n\r\nBecause the appeal allowed by law for the decision of the district\r\ncourts to the circuit courts, whilst it corroborates the construction\r\nwhich regards a judge of one court as clothed with a new office, by\r\nbeing constituted a judge of the other, submits for correction erroneous\r\njudgments, not to superior or other judges, but to the erring individual\r\nhimself, acting as sole judge in the appellate court.\r\n\r\nBecause the additional services to be required may, by distances of\r\nplace and by the casualties contemplated by the bill, become\r\ndisproportionate to the strength and health of the justices who are to\r\nperform them, the additional services being, moreover, entitled to no\r\nadditional compensation, nor the additional expenses incurred to\r\nreimbursement. In this view the bill appears to be contrary to equity,\r\nas well as a precedent for modifications and extensions of judicial\r\nservices encroaching on the constitutional tenure of judicial offices.\r\n\r\nBecause, by referring to the President of the United States questions of\r\ndisability in the district judges and of the unreasonableness of\r\ndelaying the suits or causes pending in the district courts, and leaving\r\nit with him in such causes to require the justices of the Supreme Court\r\nto perform additional services, the bill introduces an unsuitable\r\nrelation of members of the judiciary department to a discretionary\r\nauthority of the executive department.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[From Niles's Weekly Register, vol. 1, p. 448.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas information has been received that a number of individuals who\r\nhave deserted from the Army of the United States have become sensible of\r\ntheir offense and are desirous of returning to their duty, a full pardon\r\nis hereby granted and proclaimed to each and all such individuals as\r\nshall within four months from the date hereof surrender themselves to\r\nthe commanding officer of any military post within the United States or\r\nthe Territories thereof.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have caused the seal of the United States to be\r\naffixed to these presents, and signed the same with my hand.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, the 7th day of February, A.D. 1812, and\r\nof the Independence of the United States the thirty-sixth.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  JAMES MONROE,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From Annals of Congress, Twelfth Congress, part 2, 2223.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas the Congress of the United States, by virtue of the constituted\r\nauthority vested in them, have declared by their act bearing date the\r\n18th day of the present month that war exists between the United Kingdom\r\nof Great Britain and Ireland and the dependencies thereof and the United\r\nStates of America and their Territories:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, James Madison, President of the United States of\r\nAmerica, do hereby proclaim the same to all whom it may concern;

that He\r\nwould guide their public councils, animate their patriotism, and bestow\r\nHis blessing on their arms; that He would inspire all nations with a\r\nlove of justice and of concord and with a reverence for the unerring\r\nprecept of our holy religion to do to others as they would require that\r\nothers should do to them; and, finally, that, turning the hearts of our\r\nenemies from the violence and injustice which sway their councils\r\nagainst us, He would hasten a restoration of the blessings of peace.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nGiven at Washington, the 9th day of July, A.D. 1812.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  JAMES MONROE,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From Niles's Weekly Register, vol. 3, p. 101.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas information has been received that a number of individuals who\r\nhave deserted from the Army of the United States have become sensible of\r\ntheir offenses and are desirous of returning to their duty, a full\r\npardon is hereby granted and proclaimed to each and all such individuals\r\nas shall within four months from the date hereof surrender themselves to\r\nthe commanding officer of any military post within the United States or\r\nthe Territories thereof.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have caused the seal of the United States to be\r\naffixed to these presents, and signed the same with my hand.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, the 8th day of October, A.D. 1812, and\r\nof the Independence of the United States the thirty-seventh.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  JAMES MONROE,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTH ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _November 4, 1812_.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nOn our present meeting it is my first duty to invite your attention to\r\nthe providential favors which our country has experienced in the unusual\r\ndegree of health dispensed to its inhabitants, and in the rich abundance\r\nwith which the earth has rewarded the labors bestowed on it. In the\r\nsuccessful cultivation of other branches of industry, and in the\r\nprogress of general improvement favorable to the national prosperity,\r\nthere is just occasion also for our mutual congratulations and\r\nthankfulness.\r\n\r\nWith these blessings are necessarily mingled the pressures and\r\nvicissitudes incident to the state of war into which the United States\r\nhave been forced by the perseverance of a foreign power in its system of\r\ninjustice and aggression.\r\n\r\nPrevious to its declaration it was deemed proper, as a measure of\r\nprecaution and forecast, that a considerable force should be placed in\r\nthe Michigan Territory with a general view to its security, and, in\r\nthe event of war, to such operations in the uppermost Canada as would\r\nintercept the hostile influence of Great Britain over the savages,\r\nobtain the command of the lake on which that part of Canada borders,\r\nand maintain cooperating relations with such forces as might be most\r\nconveniently employed against other parts. Brigadier-General Hull was\r\ncharged with this provisional service, having under his command a body\r\nof troops composed of regulars and of volunteers from the State of Ohio.\r\nHaving reached his destination after his knowledge of the war, and\r\npossessing discretionary authority to act offensively, he passed into\r\nthe neighboring territory of the enemy with a prospect of easy and\r\nvictorious progress. The expedition, nevertheless, terminated\r\nunfortunately, not only in a retreat to the town and fort of Detroit,\r\nbut in the surrender of both and of the gallant corps commanded by that\r\nofficer. The causes of this painful reverse will be investigated by a\r\nmilitary tribunal.\r\n\r\nA distinguishing feature in the operations which preceded and followed\r\nthis adverse event is the use made by the enemy of the merciless savages\r\nunder their influence. Whilst the benevolent policy of the United States\r\ninvariably recommended peace and promoted civilization among that\r\nwretched portion of the human race, and was making exertions to dissuade\r\nthem from taking either side in the war, the enemy has not scrupled to\r\ncall to his aid their ruthless ferocity, armed with the horrors of those\r\ninstruments of carnage and torture which are known to spare neither age\r\nnor sex. In this outrage against the laws of honorable war and against\r\nthe feelings sacred to humanity the British commanders can not resort to\r\na plea of retaliation, for it is committed in the face of our example.\r\nThey can not mitigate it by calling it a self-defense against men in\r\narms, for it embraces the most shocking butcheries of defenseless\r\nfamilies. Nor can it be pretended that they are not answerable for the\r\natrocities perpetrated, since the savages are employed with a knowledge,\r\nand even with menaces, that their fury could not be controlled. Such is\r\nthe spectacle which the deputed authorities of a nation boasting its\r\nreligion and morality have not been restrained from presenting to an\r\nenlightened age.\r\n\r\nThe misfortune at Detroit was not, however, without a consoling effect.\r\nIt was followed by signal proofs that the national spirit rises\r\naccording to the pressure on it. The loss of an important post and of\r\nthe brave men surrendered with it inspired everywhere new ardor and\r\ndetermination. In the States and districts least remote it was no sooner\r\nknown than every citizen was ready to fly with his arms at once to\r\nprotect his brethren against the bloodthirsty savages let loose by the\r\nenemy on an extensive frontier, and to convert a partial calamity into\r\na source of invigorated efforts. This patriotic zeal, which it was\r\nnecessary rather to limit than excite, has embodied an ample force from\r\nthe States of Kentucky and Ohio and from parts of Pennsylvania and\r\nVirginia. It is placed, with the addition of a few regulars, under\r\nthe command of Brigadier-General Harrison, who possesses the entire\r\nconfidence of his fellow-soldiers, among whom are citizens, some of them\r\nvolunteers in the ranks, not less distinguished by their political\r\nstations than by their personal merits. The greater portion of this\r\nforce is proceeding on its destination toward the Michigan Territory,\r\nhaving succeeded in relieving an important frontier post, and in several\r\nincidental operations against hostile tribes of savages, rendered\r\nindispensable by the subserviency into which they had been seduced by\r\nthe enemy--a seduction the more cruel as it could not fail to impose a\r\nnecessity of precautionary severities against those who yielded to it.\r\n\r\nAt a recent date an attack was made on a post of the enemy near Niagara\r\nby a detachment of the regular and other forces under the command of\r\nMajor-General Van Rensselaer, of the militia of the State of New York.\r\nThe attack, it appears, was ordered in compliance with the ardor of the\r\ntroops, who executed it with distinguished gallantry, and were for a\r\ntime victorious; but not receiving the expected support, they were\r\ncompelled to yield to reenforcements of British regulars and savages.\r\nOur loss has been considerable, and is deeply to be lamented. That of\r\nthe enemy, less ascertained, will be the more felt, as it includes among\r\nthe killed the commanding general, who was also the governor of the\r\nProvince, and was sustained by veteran troops from unexperienced\r\nsoldiers, who must daily improve in the duties of the field.\r\n\r\nOur expectation of gaining the command of the Lakes by the invasion of\r\nCanada from Detroit having been disappointed, measures were instantly\r\ntaken to provide on them a naval force superior to that of the enemy.\r\nFrom the talents and activity of the officer charged with this object\r\neverything that can be done may be expected. Should the present season\r\nnot admit of complete success, the progress made will insure for the\r\nnext a naval ascendency where it is essential to our permanent peace\r\nwith and control over the savages.\r\n\r\nAmong the incidents to the measures of the war I am constrained to\r\nadvert to the refusal of the governors of Massachusetts and Connecticut\r\nto furnish the required detachments of militia toward the defense of the\r\nmaritime frontier. The refusal was founded on a novel and unfortunate\r\nexposition of the provisions of the Constitution relating to the\r\nmilitia. The correspondences which will be laid before you contain\r\nthe requisite information on the subject. It is obvious that if the\r\nauthority of the United States to call into service and command the\r\nmilitia for the public defense can be thus frustrated, even in a state\r\nof declared war and of course under apprehensions of invasion preceding\r\nwar, they are not one nation for the purpose most of all requiring it,\r\nand that the public safety may have no other resource than in those\r\nlarge and permanent military establishments which are forbidden by the\r\nprinciples of our free government, and against the necessity of which\r\nthe militia were meant to be a constitutional bulwark.\r\n\r\nOn the coasts and on the ocean the war has been as successful as\r\ncircumstances inseparable from its early stages could promise. Our\r\npublic ships and private cruisers, by their activity, and, where there\r\nwas occasion, by their intrepidity, have made the enemy sensible of the\r\ndifference between a reciprocity of captures and the long confinement of\r\nthem to their side. Our trade, with little exception, has safely reached\r\nour ports, having been much favored in it by the course pursued by a\r\nsquadron of our frigates under the command of Commodore Rodgers, and in\r\nthe instance in which skill and bravery were more particularly tried\r\nwith those of the enemy the American flag had an auspicious triumph.\r\nThe frigate _Constitution_, commanded by Captain Hull, after a close\r\nand short engagement completely disabled and captured a British frigate,\r\ngaining for that officer and all on board a praise which can not be too\r\nliberally bestowed, not merely for the victory actually achieved, but\r\nfor that prompt and cool exertion of commanding talents which, giving to\r\ncourage its highest character, and to the force applied its full effect,\r\nproved that more could have been done in a contest requiring more.\r\n\r\nAnxious to abridge the evils from which a state of war can not be\r\nexempt, I lost no time after it was declared in conveying to the British\r\nGovernment the terms on which its progress might be arrested, without\r\nawaiting the delays of a formal and final pacification, and our chargé\r\nd'affaires at London was at the same time authorized to agree to an\r\narmistice founded upon them. These terms required that the orders in\r\ncouncil should be repealed as they affected the United States, without a\r\nrevival of blockades violating acknowledged rules, and that there should\r\nbe an immediate discharge of American seamen from British ships, and a\r\nstop to impressment from American ships, with an understanding that\r\nan exclusion of the seamen of each nation from the ships of the other\r\nshould be stipulated, and that the armistice should be improved into\r\na definitive and comprehensive adjustment of depending controversies.\r\nAlthough a repeal of the orders susceptible of explanations meeting the\r\nviews of this Government had taken place before this pacific advance was\r\ncommunicated to that of Great Britain, the advance was declined from an\r\navowed repugnance to a suspension of the practice of impressments during\r\nthe armistice, and without any intimation that the arrangement proposed\r\nwith respect to seamen would be accepted. Whether the subsequent\r\ncommunications from this Government, affording an occasion for\r\nreconsidering the subject on the part of Great Britain, will be viewed\r\nin a more favorable light or received in a more accommodating spirit\r\nremains to be known. It would be unwise to relax our measures in any\r\nrespect on a presumption of such a result.\r\n\r\nThe documents from the Department of State which relate to this subject\r\nwill give a view also of the propositions for an armistice which have\r\nbeen received here, one of them from the authorities at Halifax and in\r\nCanada, the other from the British Government itself through Admiral\r\nWarren, and of the grounds on which neither of them could be accepted.\r\n\r\nOur affairs with France retain the posture which they held at my last\r\ncommunications to you. Notwithstanding the authorized expectations of an\r\nearly as well as favorable issue to the discussions on foot, these have\r\nbeen procrastinated to the latest date. The only intervening occurrence\r\nmeriting attention is the promulgation of a French decree purporting to\r\nbe a definitive repeal of the Berlin and Milan decrees. This proceeding,\r\nalthough made the ground of the repeal of the British orders in council,\r\nis rendered by the time and manner of it liable to many objections.\r\n\r\nThe final communications from our special minister to Denmark afford\r\nfurther proofs of the good effects of his mission, and of the amicable\r\ndisposition of the Danish Government. From Russia we have the\r\nsatisfaction to receive assurances of continued friendship, and that it\r\nwill not be affected by the rupture between the United States and Great\r\nBritain. Sweden also professes sentiments favorable to the subsisting\r\nharmony.\r\n\r\nWith the Barbary Powers, excepting that of Algiers, our affairs remain\r\non the ordinary footing. The consul-general residing with that Regency\r\nhas suddenly and without cause been banished, together with all the\r\nAmerican citizens found there. Whether this was the transitory effect of\r\ncapricious despotism or the first act of predetermined hostility is not\r\nascertained. Precautions were taken by the consul on the latter\r\nsupposition.\r\n\r\nThe Indian tribes not under foreign instigations remain at peace, and\r\nreceive the civilizing attentions which have proved so beneficial to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWith a view to that vigorous prosecution of the war to which our\r\nnational faculties are adequate, the attention of Congress will be\r\nparticularly drawn to the insufficiency of existing provisions for\r\nfilling up the military establishment. Such is the happy condition of\r\nour country, arising from the facility of subsistence and the high wages\r\nfor every species of occupation, that notwithstanding the augmented\r\ninducements provided at the last session, a partial success only has\r\nattended the recruiting service. The deficiency has been necessarily\r\nsupplied during the campaign by other than regular troops, with all\r\nthe inconveniences and expense incident to them. The remedy lies in\r\nestablishing more favorably for the private soldier the proportion\r\nbetween his recompense and the term of his enlistment, and it is a\r\nsubject which can not too soon or too seriously be taken into\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThe same insufficiency has been experienced in the provisions for\r\nvolunteers made by an act of the last session. The recompense for the\r\nservice required in this case is still less attractive than in the\r\nother, and although patriotism alone has sent into the field some\r\nvaluable corps of that description, those alone who can afford the\r\nsacrifice can be reasonably expected to yield to that impulse.\r\n\r\nIt will merit consideration also whether as auxiliary to the security\r\nof our frontiers corps may not be advantageously organized with a\r\nrestriction of their services to particular districts convenient to\r\nthem, and whether the local and occasional services of mariners and\r\nothers in the seaport towns under a similar organization would not be\r\na provident addition to the means of their defense.\r\n\r\nI recommend a provision for an increase of the general officers of the\r\nArmy, the deficiency of which has been illustrated by the number and\r\ndistance of separate commands which the course of the war and the\r\nadvantage of the service have required.\r\n\r\nAnd I can not press too strongly on the earliest attention of the\r\nLegislature the importance of the reorganization of the staff\r\nestablishment with a view to render more distinct and definite the\r\nrelations and responsibilities of its several departments. That there\r\nis room for improvements which will materially promote both economy and\r\nsuccess in what appertains to the Army and the war is equally inculcated\r\nby the examples of other countries and by the experience of our own.\r\n\r\nA revision of the militia laws for the purpose of rendering them more\r\nsystematic and better adapting them to emergencies of the war is at this\r\ntime particularly desirable.\r\n\r\nOf the additional ships authorized to be fitted for service, two will\r\nbe shortly ready to sail, a third is under repair, and delay will be\r\navoided in the repair of the residue. Of the appropriations for the\r\npurchase of materials for shipbuilding, the greater part has been\r\napplied to that object and the purchase will be continued with the\r\nbalance.\r\n\r\nThe enterprising spirit which has characterized our naval force and its\r\nsuccess, both in restraining insults and depredations on our coasts and\r\nin reprisals on the enemy, will not fail to recommend an enlargement of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThere being reason to believe that the act prohibiting the acceptance\r\nof British licenses is not a sufficient guard against the use of them,\r\nfor purposes favorable to the interests and views of the enemy, further\r\nprovisions on that subject are highly important. Nor is it less so that\r\npenal enactments should be provided for cases of corrupt and perfidious\r\nintercourse with the enemy, not amounting to treason nor yet embraced\r\nby any statutory provisions.\r\n\r\nA considerable number of American vessels which were in England when the\r\nrevocation of the orders in council took place were laden with British\r\nmanufactures under an erroneous impression that the nonimportation act\r\nwould immediately cease to operate, and have arrived in the United\r\nStates. It did not appear proper to exercise on unforeseen cases of such\r\nmagnitude the ordinary powers vested in the Treasury Department to\r\nmitigate forfeitures without previously affording to Congress an\r\nopportunity of making on the subject such provision as they may think\r\nproper. In their decision they will doubtless equally consult what is\r\ndue to equitable considerations and to the public interest.\r\n\r\nThe receipts into the Treasury during the year ending on the 30th of\r\nSeptember last have exceeded $16,500,000, which have been sufficient\r\nto defray all the demands on the Treasury to that day, including a\r\nnecessary reimbursement of near three millions of the principal of the\r\npublic debt. In these receipts is included a sum of near $5,850,000,\r\nreceived on account of the loans authorized by the acts of the last\r\nsession; the whole sum actually obtained on loan amounts to $11,000,000,\r\nthe residue of which, being receivable subsequent to the 30th of\r\nSeptember last, will, together with the current revenue, enable us to\r\ndefray all the expenses of this year.\r\n\r\nThe duties on the late unexpected importations of British manufactures\r\nwill render the revenue of the ensuing year more productive than could\r\nhave been anticipated.\r\n\r\nThe situation of our country, fellow-citizens, is not without its\r\ndifficulties, though it abounds in animating considerations, of which\r\nthe view here presented of our pecuniary resources is an example. With\r\nmore than one nation we have serious and unsettled controversies, and\r\nwith one, powerful in the means and habits of war, we are at war. The\r\nspirit and strength of the nation are nevertheless equal to the support\r\nof all its rights, and to carry it through all its trials. They can be\r\nmet in that confidence. Above all, we have the inestimable consolation\r\nof knowing that the war in which we are actually engaged is a war\r\nneither of ambition nor of vainglory; that it is waged not in violation\r\nof the rights of others, but in the maintenance of our own; that it was\r\npreceded by a patience without example under wrongs accumulating without\r\nend, and that it was finally not declared until every hope of averting\r\nit was extinguished by the transfer of the British scepter into new\r\nhands clinging to former councils, and until declarations were\r\nreiterated to the last hour, through the British envoy here, that\r\nthe hostile edicts against our commercial rights and our maritime\r\nindependence would not be revoked; nay, that they could not be revoked\r\nwithout violating the obligations of Great Britain to other powers, as\r\nwell as to her own interests. To have shrunk under such circumstances\r\nfrom manly resistance would have been a degradation blasting our best\r\nand proudest hopes; it would have struck us from the high rank where the\r\nvirtuous struggles of our fathers had placed us, and have betrayed the\r\nmagnificent legacy which we hold in trust for future generations. It\r\nwould have acknowledged that on the element which forms three-fourths of\r\nthe globe we inhabit, and where all independent nations have equal and\r\ncommon rights, the American people were not an independent people,\r\nbut colonists and vassals. It was at this moment and with such an\r\nalternative that war was chosen. The nation felt the necessity of it,\r\nand called for it. The appeal was accordingly made, in a just cause,\r\nto the Just and All-powerful Being who holds in His hand the chain of\r\nevents and the destiny of nations. It remains only that, faithful to\r\nourselves, entangled in no connections with the views of other powers,\r\nand ever ready to accept peace from the hand of justice, we prosecute\r\nthe war with united counsels and with the ample faculties of the nation\r\nuntil peace be so obtained and as the only means under the Divine\r\nblessing of speedily obtaining it.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER, 12, 1812.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nFor the further information of Congress relative to the pacific advances\r\nmade on the part of this Government to that of Great Britain, and the\r\nmanner in which they have been met by the latter, I transmit the sequel\r\nof the communications on that subject received from the late chargé\r\nd'affaires at London.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 17, 1812.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress copies of a letter from the consul general of\r\nthe United States to Algiers, stating the circumstances preceding and\r\nattending his departure from that Regency.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 11, 1812_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress copies of a letter to the Secretary of the Navy\r\nfrom Captain Decatur, of the frigate _United States_, reporting his\r\ncombat and capture of the British frigate _Macedonian_. Too much\r\npraise can not be bestowed on that officer and his companions on board\r\nfor the consummate skill and conspicuous valor by which this trophy has\r\nbeen added to the naval arms of the United States.\r\n\r\nI transmit also a letter from Captain Jones, who commanded the sloop\r\nof war _Wasp_, reporting his capture of the British sloop of war\r\n_Frolic_, after a close action, in which other brilliant titles will\r\nbe seen to the public admiration and praise.\r\n\r\nA nation feeling what it owes to itself and to its citizens could never\r\nabandon to arbitrary violence on the ocean a class of them which give\r\nsuch examples of capacity and courage in defending their rights on that\r\nelement, examples which ought to impress on the enemy, however brave and\r\npowerful, preference of justice and peace to hostility against a country\r\nwhose prosperous career may be accelerated but can not be prevented by\r\nthe assaults made on it.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 22, 1813.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit, for the information of Congress, copies of a correspondence\r\nbetween John Mitchell, agent for American prisoners of war at Halifax,\r\nand the British admiral commanding at that station.\r\n\r\nI transmit, for the like purpose, copies of a letter from Commodore\r\nRodgers to the Secretary of the Navy,\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 22, 1813.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI lay before Congress a letter, with accompanying documents, from\r\nCaptain Bainbridge, now commanding the United States frigate the\r\n_Constitution_, reporting his capture and destruction of the\r\nBritish frigate the _Java_. The circumstances and the issue of this\r\ncombat afford another example of the professional skill and heroic\r\nspirit which prevail in our naval service. The signal display of both by\r\nCaptain Bainbridge, his officers and crew, commands the highest praise.\r\n\r\nThis being a second instance in which the condition of the captured\r\nship, by rendering it impossible to get her into port, has barred\r\na contemplated reward of successful valor, I recommend to the\r\nconsideration of Congress the equity and propriety of a general\r\nprovision allowing in such cases, both past and future, a fair\r\nproportion of the value which would accrue to the captors on the\r\nsafe arrival and sale of the prize.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 24, 1813.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI lay before Congress copies of a proclamation of the British\r\nlieutenant-governor of the island of Bermuda, which has appeared under\r\ncircumstances leaving no doubt of its authenticity. It recites a British\r\norder in council of the 26th of October last, providing for the supply\r\nof the British West Indies and other colonial possessions by a trade\r\nunder special licenses, and is accompanied by a circular instruction to\r\nthe colonial governors which confines licensed importations from ports\r\nof the United States to the ports of the Eastern States exclusively.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Great Britain had already introduced into her commerce\r\nduring war a system which, at once violating the rights of other nations\r\nand resting on a mass of forgery and perjury unknown to other times,\r\nwas making an unfortunate progress in undermining those principles\r\nof morality and religion which are the best foundation of national\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nThe policy now proclaimed to the world introduces into her modes of\r\nwarfare a system equally distinguished by the deformity of its features\r\nand the depravity of its character, having for its object to dissolve\r\nthe ties of allegiance and the sentiments of loyalty in the adversary\r\nnation, and to seduce and separate its component parts the one from the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe general tendency of these demoralizing and disorganizing\r\ncontrivances will be reprobated by the civilized and Christian world,\r\nand the insulting attempt on the virtue, the honor, the patriotism, and\r\nthe fidelity of our brethren of the Eastern States will not fail to call\r\nforth all their indignation and resentment, and to attach more and more\r\nall the States to that happy Union and Constitution against which such\r\ninsidious and malignant artifices are directed.\r\n\r\nThe better to guard, nevertheless, against the effect of individual\r\ncupidity and treachery and to turn the corrupt projects of the enemy\r\nagainst himself, I recommend to the consideration of Congress the\r\nexpediency of an effectual prohibition of any trade whatever by citizens\r\nor inhabitants of the United States under special licenses, whether\r\nrelating to persons or ports, and in aid thereof a prohibition of all\r\nexportations from the United States in foreign bottoms, few of which are\r\nactually employed, whilst multiplying counterfeits of their flags and\r\npapers are covering and encouraging the navigation of the enemy.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 3, 1813.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nConformably to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n27th of January last, I transmit \"rolls of the persons having office or\r\nemployment of a public nature under the United States,\"\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETO MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 5, 1812.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe bill entitled \"An act supplementary to the acts heretofore passed on\r\nthe subject of an uniform rule of naturalization,\" which passed the two\r\nHouses at the last session of Congress, having appeared to me liable to\r\nabuse by aliens having no real purpose of effectuating a naturalization,\r\nand therefore not been signed, and having been presented at an hour\r\ntoo near the close of the session to be returned with objections for\r\nreconsideration, the bill failed to become a law. I also recommend that\r\nprovision be now made in favor of aliens entitled to the contemplated\r\nbenefit, under such regulations as will prevent advantage being taken\r\nof it for improper purposes.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout to add the solemnity of an oath to the obligations imposed by a\r\nsecond call to the station in which my country heretofore placed me,\r\nI find in the presence of this respectable assembly an opportunity of\r\npublicly repeating my profound sense of so distinguished a confidence\r\nand of the responsibility united with it. The impressions on me are\r\nstrengthened by such an evidence that my faithful endeavors to discharge\r\nmy arduous duties have been favorably estimated, and by a consideration\r\nof the momentous period at which the trust has been renewed. From the\r\nweight and magnitude now belonging to it I should be compelled to shrink\r\nif I had less reliance on the support of an enlightened and generous\r\npeople, and felt less deeply a conviction that the war with a powerful\r\nnation, which forms so prominent a feature in our situation, is stamped\r\nwith that justice which invites the smiles of Heaven on the means of\r\nconducting it to a successful termination.\r\n\r\nMay we not cherish this sentiment without presumption when we reflect\r\non the characters by which this war is distinguished?\r\n\r\nIt was not declared on the part of the United States until it had been\r\nlong made on them, in reality though not in name; until arguments and\r\nexpostulations had been exhausted; until a positive declaration had been\r\nreceived that the wrongs provoking it would not be discontinued; nor\r\nuntil this last appeal could no longer be delayed without breaking down\r\nthe spirit of the nation, destroying all confidence in itself and in its\r\npolitical institutions, and either perpetuating a state of disgraceful\r\nsuffering or regaining by more costly sacrifices and more severe\r\nstruggles our lost rank and respect among independent powers.\r\n\r\nOn the issue of the war are staked our national sovereignty on the\r\nhigh seas and the security of an important class of citizens, whose\r\noccupations give the proper value to those of every other class. Not to\r\ncontend for such a stake is to surrender our equality with other powers\r\non the element common to all and to violate the sacred title which every\r\nmember of the society has to its protection. I need not call into view\r\nthe unlawfulness of the practice by which our mariners are forced at the\r\nwill of every cruising officer from their own vessels into foreign\r\nones, nor paint the outrages inseparable from it. The proofs are in the\r\nrecords of each successive Administration of our Government, and the\r\ncruel sufferings of that portion of the American people have found their\r\nway to every bosom not dead to the sympathies of human nature.\r\n\r\nAs the war was just in its origin and necessary and noble in its\r\nobjects, we can reflect with a proud satisfaction that in carrying it\r\non no principle of justice or honor, no usage of civilized nations, no\r\nprecept of courtesy or humanity, have been infringed, The war has been\r\nwaged on our part with scrupulous regard to all these obligations, and\r\nin a spirit of liberality which was never surpassed.\r\n\r\nHow little has been the effect of this example on the conduct of the\r\nenemy!\r\n\r\nThey have retained as prisoners of war citizens of the United States\r\nnot liable to be so considered under the usages of war.\r\n\r\nThey have refused to consider as prisoners of war, and threatened to\r\npunish as traitors and deserters, persons emigrating without restraint\r\nto the United States, incorporated by naturalization into our political\r\nfamily, and fighting under the authority of their adopted country in\r\nopen and honorable war for the maintenance of its rights and safety.\r\nSuch is the avowed purpose of a Government which is in the practice of\r\nnaturalizing by thousands citizens of other countries, and not only of\r\npermitting but compelling them to fight its battles against their native\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThey have not, it is true, taken into their own hands the hatchet and\r\nthe knife, devoted to indiscriminate massacre, but they have let loose\r\nthe savages armed with these cruel instruments; have allured them into\r\ntheir service, and carried them to battle by their sides, eager to glut\r\ntheir savage thirst with the blood of the vanquished and to finish the\r\nwork of torture and death on maimed and defenseless captives. And, what\r\nwas never before seen, British commanders have extorted victory over the\r\nunconquerable valor of our troops by presenting to the sympathy of their\r\nchief captives awaiting massacre from their savage associates. And now\r\nwe find them, in further contempt of the modes of honorable warfare,\r\nsupplying the place of a conquering force by attempts to disorganize our\r\npolitical society, to dismember our confederated Republic. Happily, like\r\nothers, these will recoil on the authors; but they mark the degenerate\r\ncounsels from which they emanate, and if they did not belong to a\r\nseries of unexampled inconsistencies might excite the greater wonder as\r\nproceeding from a Government which founded the very war in which it has\r\nbeen so long engaged on a charge against the disorganizing and\r\ninsurrectional policy of its adversary.\r\n\r\nTo render the justice of the war on our part the more conspicuous, the\r\nreluctance to commence it was followed by the earliest and strongest\r\nmanifestations of a disposition to arrest its progress. The sword was\r\nscarcely out of the scabbard before the enemy was apprised of the\r\nreasonable terms on which it would be resheathed. Still more precise\r\nadvances were repeated, and have been received in a spirit forbidding\r\nevery reliance not placed on the military resources of the nation.\r\n\r\nThese resources are amply sufficient to bring the war to an honorable\r\nissue. Our nation is in number more than half that of the British Isles.\r\nIt is composed of a brave, a free, a virtuous, and an intelligent\r\npeople. Our country abounds in the necessaries, the arts, and the\r\ncomforts of life. A general prosperity is visible in the public\r\ncountenance. The means employed by the British cabinet to undermine it\r\nhave recoiled on themselves; have given to our national faculties a more\r\nrapid development, and, draining or diverting the precious metals from\r\nBritish circulation and British vaults, have poured them into those of\r\nthe United States. It is a propitious consideration that an unavoidable\r\nwar should have found this seasonable facility for the contributions\r\nrequired to support it. When the public voice called for war, all knew,\r\nand still know, that without them it could not be carried on through the\r\nperiod which it might last, and the patriotism, the good sense, and the\r\nmanly spirit of our fellow-citizens are pledges for the cheerfulness\r\nwith which they will bear each his share of the common burden. To render\r\nthe war short and its success sure, animated and systematic exertions\r\nalone are necessary, and the success of our arms now may long preserve\r\nour country from the necessity of another resort to them. Already\r\nhave the gallant exploits of our naval heroes proved to the world\r\nour inherent capacity to maintain our rights on one element. If the\r\nreputation of our arms has been thrown under clouds on the other,\r\npresaging flashes of heroic enterprise assure us that nothing is wanting\r\nto correspondent triumphs there also but die discipline and habits which\r\nare in daily progress.\r\n\r\nMARCH 4, 1813.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL SESSION MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 25, 1813_.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nAt an early day after the close of the last session of Congress an offer\r\nwas formally communicated from His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of\r\nRussia of his mediation, as the common friend of the United States and\r\nGreat Britain, for the purpose of facilitating a peace between them. The\r\nhigh character of the Emperor Alexander being a satisfactory pledge for\r\nthe sincerity and impartiality of his offer, it was immediately\r\naccepted, and as a further proof of the disposition on the part of the\r\nUnited States, to meet their adversary in honorable experiments for\r\nterminating the war it was determined to avoid intermediate delays\r\nincident to the distance of the parties by a definitive provision for\r\nthe contemplated negotiation. Three of our eminent citizens were\r\naccordingly commissioned with the requisite powers to conclude a treaty\r\nof peace with persons clothed with like powers on the part of Great\r\nBritain. They are authorized also to enter into such conventional\r\nregulations of the commerce between the two countries as may be mutually\r\nadvantageous. The two envoys who, were in the United States at the time\r\nof their appointment have proceeded to join their colleague already at\r\nSt. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nThe envoys have received another commission authorizing them to conclude\r\nwith Russia a treaty of commerce with a view to strengthen the amicable\r\nrelations and improve the beneficial intercourse between the two\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nThe issue of this friendly interposition of the Russian Emperor and this\r\npacific manifestation on the part of the United States time only can\r\ndecide. That the sentiments of Great Britain toward that Sovereign will\r\nhave produced an acceptance of his offered mediation must be presumed.\r\nThat no adequate motives exist to prefer a continuance of war with the\r\nUnited States to the terms on which they are willing to close it is\r\ncertain. The British cabinet also must be sensible that, with respect to\r\nthe important question of impressment, on which the war so essentially\r\nturns, a search for or seizure of British persons or property on board\r\nneutral vessels on the high seas is not a belligerent right derived from\r\nthe law of nations, and it is obvious that no visit or search or use of\r\nforce for any purpose on board the vessels of one independent power on\r\nthe high seas can in war or peace be sanctioned by the laws or authority\r\nof another power. It is equally obvious that, for the purpose of\r\npreserving to each State its seafaring members, by excluding them from\r\nthe vessels of the other, the mode heretofore proposed by the United\r\nStates and now enacted by them as an article of municipal policy, can\r\nnot for a moment be compared with the mode practiced by Great Britain\r\nwithout a conviction of its title to preference, inasmuch as the latter\r\nleaves the discrimination between the mariners of the two nations to\r\nofficers exposed by unavoidable bias as well as by a defect of evidence\r\nto a wrong decision, under circumstances precluding for the most part\r\nthe enforcement of controlling penalties, and where a wrong decision,\r\nbesides the irreparable violation of the sacred rights of persons, might\r\nfrustrate the plans and profits of entire voyages; whereas the mode\r\nassumed by the United States guards with studied fairness and efficacy\r\nagainst errors in such cases and avoids the effect of casual errors on\r\nthe safety of navigation and the success of mercantile expeditions.\r\n\r\nIf the reasonableness of expectations drawn from these considerations\r\ncould guarantee their fulfillment a just peace would not be distant. But\r\nit becomes the wisdom of the National Legislature to keep in mind the\r\ntrue policy, or rather the indispensable obligation, of adapting its\r\nmeasures to the supposition that the only course to that happy event is\r\nin the vigorous employment of the resources of war. And painful as the\r\nreflection is, this duty is particularly enforced by the spirit and\r\nmanner in which the war continues to be waged by the enemy, who,\r\nuninfluenced by the unvaried examples of humanity set them, are adding\r\nto the savage fury of it on one frontier a system of plunder and\r\nconflagration on the other, equally forbidden by respect for national\r\ncharacter and by the established rules of civilized warfare.\r\n\r\nAs an encouragement to persevering and invigorated exertions to bring\r\nthe contest to a happy result, I have the satisfaction of being able to\r\nappeal to the auspicious progress of our arms both by land and on the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nIn continuation of the brilliant achievements of our infant Navy, a\r\nsignal triumph has been gained by Captain Lawrence and his companions in\r\nthe _Hornet_ sloop of war, which destroyed a British sloop of war\r\nwith a celerity so unexampled and with a slaughter of the enemy so\r\ndisproportionate to the loss in the _Hornet_ as to claim for the\r\nconquerors the highest praise and the full recompense provided by\r\nCongress in preceding cases. Our public ships of war in general, as well\r\nas the private armed vessels, have continued also their activity and\r\nsuccess against the commerce of the enemy, and by their vigilance and\r\naddress have greatly frustrated the efforts of the hostile squadrons\r\ndistributed along our coasts to intercept them in returning into port\r\nand resuming their cruises.\r\n\r\nThe augmentation of our naval force, as authorized at the last session\r\nof Congress, is in progress. On the Lakes our superiority is near at\r\nhand where it is not already established.\r\n\r\nThe events of the campaign, so far as they are known to us, furnish\r\nmatter of congratulation, and show that under a wise organization and\r\nefficient direction the Army is destined to a glory not less brilliant\r\nthan that which already encircles the Navy. The attack and capture of\r\nYork is in that quarter a presage of future and greater victories, while\r\non the western frontier the issue of the late siege of Fort Meigs leaves\r\nus nothing to regret but a single act of inconsiderate valor.\r\n\r\nThe provisions last made for filling the ranks and enlarging the staff\r\nof the Army have had the best effects. It will be for the consideration\r\nof Congress whether other provisions depending on their authority may\r\nnot still further improve the military establishment and the means of\r\ndefense.\r\n\r\nThe sudden death of the distinguished citizen who represented the United\r\nStates in France, without any special arrangements by him for such a\r\ncontingency, has left us without the expected sequel to his last\r\ncommunications, nor has the French Government taken any measures for\r\nbringing the depending negotiations to a conclusion through its\r\nrepresentative in the United States. This failure adds to delays before\r\nso unreasonably spun out. A successor to our deceased minister has been\r\nappointed and is ready to proceed on his mission. The course which he\r\nwill pursue in fulfilling it is that prescribed by a steady regard to\r\nthe true interests of the United States, which equally avoids an\r\nabandonment of their just demands and a connection of their fortunes\r\nwith the systems of other powers.\r\n\r\nThe receipts in the Treasury from the 1st of October to the 31st day of\r\nMarch last, including the sums received on account of Treasury notes and\r\nof the loans authorized by the acts of the last and the preceding\r\nsessions of Congress, have amounted to $15,412,000. The expenditures\r\nduring the same period amounted to $15,920,000, and left in the Treasury\r\non the 1st of April the sum of $1,857,000. The loan of $16,000,000,\r\nauthorized by the act of the 8th of February last, has been contracted\r\nfor. Of that sum more than $1,000,000 had been paid into the Treasury\r\nprior to the 1st of April, and formed a part of the receipts as above\r\nstated. The remainder of that loan, amounting to near $15,000,000, with\r\nthe sum of $5,000,000 authorized to be issued in Treasury notes, and the\r\nestimated receipts from the customs and the sales of public lands,\r\namounting to $9,300,000, and making, in the whole, $29,300,000, to\r\nbe received during the last nine months of the present year, will\r\nbe necessary to meet the expenditures already authorized and the\r\nengagements contracted in relation to the public debt. These engagements\r\namount during that period to $10,500,000, which, with near one million\r\nfor the civil, miscellaneous, and diplomatic expenses, both foreign and\r\ndomestic, and $17,800,000 for the military and naval expenditures,\r\nincluding the ships of war building and to be built, will leave a sum\r\nin the Treasury at the end of the present year equal to that on the 1st\r\nof April last. A part of this sum may be considered as a resource for\r\ndefraying any extraordinary expenses already authorized by law beyond\r\nthe sums above estimated, and a further resource for any emergency may\r\nbe found in the sum of $1,000,000, the loan of which to the United\r\nStates has been authorized by the State of Pennsylvania, but which has\r\nnot yet been brought into effect.\r\n\r\nThis view of our finances, whilst it shows that due provision has been\r\nmade for the expenses of the current year, shows at the same time, by\r\nthe limited amount of the actual revenue and the dependence on loans,\r\nthe necessity of providing more adequately for the future supplies\r\nof the Treasury. This can be best done by a well-digested system of\r\ninternal revenue in aid of existing sources, which will have the effect\r\nboth of abridging the amount of necessary loans and, on that account, as\r\nwell as by placing the public credit on a more satisfactory basis, of\r\nimproving the terms on which loans may be obtained. The loan of sixteen\r\nmillions was not contracted for at a less interest than about 7 1/2 per\r\ncent, and, although other causes may have had an agency, it can not be\r\ndoubted that, with the advantage of a more extended and less precarious\r\nrevenue, a lower rate of interest might have sufficed. A longer\r\npostponement of this advantage could not fail to have a still greater\r\ninfluence on future loans.\r\n\r\nIn recommending to the National Legislature this resort to additional\r\ntaxes I feel great satisfaction in the assurance that our constituents,\r\nwho have already displayed so much zeal and firmness in the cause of\r\ntheir country, will cheerfully give any other proof of their patriotism\r\nwhich it calls for. Happily no people, with local and transitory\r\nexceptions never to be wholly avoided, are more able than the people\r\nof the United States to spare for the public wants a portion of their\r\nprivate means, whether regard be had to the ordinary profits of industry\r\nor the ordinary price of subsistence in our country compared with those\r\nin any other. And in no case could stronger reasons be felt for yielding\r\nthe requisite contributions. By rendering the public resources certain\r\nand commensurate to the public exigencies, the constituted authorities\r\nwill be able to prosecute the war the more rapidly to its proper issue;\r\nevery hostile hope founded on a calculated failure of our resources\r\nwill be cut off, and by adding to the evidence of bravery and skill\r\nin combats on the ocean and the land, and alacrity in supplying the\r\ntreasure necessary to give them their fullest effect, and demonstrating\r\nto the world the public energy which our political institutions combine,\r\nwith the personal liberty distinguishing them, the best security will be\r\nprovided against future enterprises on the rights or the peace of the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nThe contest in which the United States are engaged appeals for its\r\nsupport to every motive that can animate an uncorrupted and enlightened\r\npeople--to the love of country; to the pride of liberty; to an emulation\r\nof the glorious founders of their independence by a successful\r\nvindication of its violated attributes; to the gratitude and sympathy\r\nwhich demand security from the most degrading wrongs of a class of\r\ncitizens who have proved themselves so worthy the protection of their\r\ncountry by their heroic zeal in its defense; and, finally, to the sacred\r\nobligation of transmitting entire to future generations that precious\r\npatrimony of national rights and independence which is held in trust by\r\nthe present from the goodness of Divine Providence.\r\n\r\nBeing aware of the inconveniences to which a protracted session at this\r\nseason would be liable, I limit the present communication to objects of\r\nprimary importance. In special messages which may ensue regard will be\r\nhad to the same consideration.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY 29, 1813.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe Swedish Government having repeatedly manifested a desire to\r\ninterchange a public minister with the United States, and having lately\r\nappointed one with that view, and other considerations concurring to\r\nrender it advisable at this period to make a correspondent appointment,\r\nI nominate Jonathan Russell, of Rhode Island, to be minister\r\nplenipotentiary of the United States to Sweden.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 6, 1813_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have received from the committee appointed by the resolution of the\r\nSenate of the 14th day of June a copy of that resolution, which\r\nauthorizes the committee to confer with the President on the subject of\r\nthe nomination made by him of a minister plenipotentiary to Sweden.\r\n\r\nConceiving it to be my duty to decline the proposed conference with the\r\ncommittee, and it being uncertain when it may be convenient to explain\r\nto the committee, and through them to the Senate, the grounds of my so\r\ndoing, I think it proper to address the explanation directly to the\r\nSenate. Without entering into a general review of the relations in which\r\nthe Constitution has placed the several departments of the Government to\r\neach other, it will suffice to remark that the Executive and Senate, in\r\nthe cases of appointments to office and of treaties, are to be\r\nconsidered as independent of and coordinate with each other. If they\r\nagree, the appointments or treaties are made; if the Senate disagree,\r\nthey fail. If the Senate wish information previous to their final\r\ndecision, the practice, keeping in view the constitutional relations of\r\nthe Senate and the Executive, has been either to request the Executive\r\nto furnish it or to refer the subject to a committee of their body to\r\ncommunicate, either formally or informally, with the head of the proper\r\ndepartment. The appointment of a committee of the Senate to confer\r\nimmediately with the Executive himself appears to lose sight of the\r\ncoordinate relation between the Executive and the Senate which the\r\nConstitution has established, and which ought therefore to be\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nThe relation between the Senate and House of Representatives, in whom\r\nlegislative power is concurrently vested, is sufficiently analogous to\r\nillustrate that between the Executive and Senate in making appointments\r\nand treaties. The two Houses are in like manner independent of and\r\ncoordinate with each other, and the invariable practice of each in\r\nappointing committees of conference and consultation is to commission\r\nthem to confer not with the coordinate body itself, but with a committee\r\nof that body; and although both branches of the Legislature may be too\r\nnumerous to hold conveniently a conference with committees, were they to\r\nbe appointed by either to confer with the entire body of the other, it\r\nmay be fairly presumed that if the whole number of either branch were\r\nnot too large for the purpose the objection to such a conference, being\r\nagainst the principle as derogating from the coordinate relations of the\r\ntwo Houses, would retain all its force.\r\n\r\nI add only that I am entirely persuaded of the purity of the intentions\r\nof the Senate in the course they have pursued on this occasion, and with\r\nwhich my view of the subject makes it my duty not to accord, and that\r\nthey will be cheerfully furnished with all the suitable information in\r\npossession of the Executive in any mode deemed consistent with the\r\nprinciples of the Constitution and the settled practice under it.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 20, 1813_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThere being sufficient ground to infer that it is the purpose of the\r\nenemy to combine with the blockade of our ports special licenses to\r\nneutral vessels or to British vessels in neutral disguises, whereby\r\nthey may draw from our country the precise kind and quantity of\r\nexports essential to their wants, whilst its general commerce remains\r\nobstructed, keeping in view also the insidious discrimination between\r\nthe different ports of the United States; and as such a system, if not\r\ncounteracted, will have the effect of diminishing very materially the\r\npressure of the war on the enemy, and encouraging a perseverance in it,\r\nat the same time that it will leave the general commerce of the United\r\nStates under all the pressure the enemy can impose, thus subjecting\r\nthe whole to British regulation in subserviency to British monopoly,\r\nI recommend to the consideration of Congress the expediency of an\r\nimmediate and effectual prohibition of exports limited to a convenient\r\nday in their next session, and removable in the meantime in the event\r\nof a cessation of the blockade of our ports.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n[From Niles's Weekly Register, vol. 4, p. 345.]\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas the Congress of the United States, by a joint resolution of the\r\ntwo Houses, have signified a request that a day may be recommended to be\r\nobserved by the people of the United States with religious solemnity as\r\na day of public humiliation and prayer; and\r\n\r\nWhereas in times of public calamity such as that of the war brought on\r\nthe United States by the injustice of a foreign government it is\r\nespecially becoming that the hearts of all should be touched with the\r\nsame and the eyes of all be turned to that Almighty Power in whose hand\r\nare the welfare and the destiny of nations:\r\n\r\nI do therefore issue this my proclamation, recommending to all who shall\r\nbe piously disposed to unite their hearts and voices in addressing at\r\none and the same time their vows and adorations to the Great Parent and\r\nSovereign of the Universe that they assemble on the second Thursday of\r\nSeptember next in their respective religious congregations to render Him\r\nthanks for the many blessings He has bestowed on the people of the\r\nUnited States; that He has blessed them with a land capable of yielding\r\nall the necessaries and requisites of human life, with ample means for\r\nconvenient exchanges with foreign countries; that He has blessed the\r\nlabors employed in its cultivation and improvement; that He is now\r\nblessing the exertions to extend and establish the arts and manufactures\r\nwhich will secure within ourselves supplies too important to remain\r\ndependent on the precarious policy or the peaceable dispositions of\r\nother nations, and particularly that He has blessed the United States\r\nwith a political Constitution founded on the will and authority of the\r\nwhole people and guaranteeing to each individual security, not only of\r\nhis person and his property, but of those sacred rights of conscience so\r\nessential to his present happiness and so dear to his future hopes; that\r\nwith those expressions of devout thankfulness be joined supplications to\r\nthe same Almighty Power that He would look down with compassion on our\r\ninfirmities; that He would pardon our manifold transgressions and\r\nawaken and strengthen in all the wholesome purposes of repentance and\r\namendment; that in this season of trial and calamity He would preside in\r\na particular manner over our public councils and inspire all citizens\r\nwith a love of their country and with those fraternal affections and\r\nthat mutual confidence which have so happy a tendency to make us safe\r\nat home and respected abroad; and that as He was graciously pleased\r\nheretofore to smile on our struggles against the attempts of the\r\nGovernment of the Empire of which these States then made a part to wrest\r\nfrom them the rights and privileges to which they were entitled in\r\ncommon with every other part and to raise them to the station of an\r\nindependent and sovereign people, so He would now be pleased in like\r\nmanner to bestow His blessing on our arms in resisting the hostile and\r\npersevering efforts of the same power to degrade us on the ocean, the\r\ncommon inheritance of all, from rights and immunities belonging and\r\nessential to the American people as a coequal member of the great\r\ncommunity of independent nations; and that, inspiring our enemies\r\nwith moderation, with justice, and with that spirit of reasonable\r\naccommodation which our country has continued to manifest, we may be\r\nenabled to beat our swords into plowshares and to enjoy in peace every\r\nman the fruits of his honest industry and the rewards of his lawful\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\nIf the public homage of a people can ever be worthy the favorable regard\r\nof the Holy and Omniscient Being to whom it is addressed, it must be\r\nthat in which those who join in it are guided only by their free choice,\r\nby the impulse of their hearts and the dictates of their consciences;\r\nand such a spectacle must be interesting to all Christian nations as\r\nproving that religion, that gift of Heaven for the good of man, freed\r\nfrom all coercive edicts, from that unhallowed connection with the\r\npowers of this world which corrupts religion into an instrument or an\r\nusurper of the policy of the state, and making no appeal but to reason,\r\nto the heart, and to the conscience, can spread its benign influence\r\neverywhere and can attract to the divine altar those freewill offerings\r\nof humble supplication, thanksgiving, and praise which alone can be\r\nacceptable to Him whom no hypocrisy can deceive and no forced sacrifices\r\npropitiate.\r\n\r\nUpon these principles and with these views the good people of the United\r\nStates are invited, in conformity with the resolution aforesaid, to\r\ndedicate the day above named to the religious solemnities therein\r\nrecommended.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nGiven at Washington, this 23d day of July, A.D. 1813.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIFTH ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 7, 1813_.\r\n\r\n_Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn meeting you at the present interesting conjuncture it would have been\r\nhighly satisfactory if I could have communicated a favorable result to\r\nthe mission charged with negotiations for restoring peace. It was a just\r\nexpectation, from the respect due to the distinguished Sovereign who had\r\ninvited them by his offer of mediation, from the readiness with which\r\nthe invitation was accepted on the part of the United States, and from\r\nthe pledge to be found in an act of their Legislature for the liberality\r\nwhich their plenipotentiaries would carry into the negotiations, that no\r\ntime would be lost by the British Government in embracing the experiment\r\nfor hastening a stop to the effusion of blood. A prompt and cordial\r\nacceptance of the mediation on that side was the less to be doubted, as\r\nit was of a nature not to submit rights or pretensions on either side\r\nto the decision of an umpire, but to afford merely an opportunity,\r\nhonorable and desirable to both, for discussing and, if possible,\r\nadjusting them for the interest of both.\r\n\r\nThe British cabinet, either mistaking our desire of peace for a dread\r\nof British power or misled by other fallacious calculations, has\r\ndisappointed this reasonable anticipation. No communications from\r\nour envoys having reached us, no information on the subject has been\r\nreceived from that source; but it is known that the mediation was\r\ndeclined in the first instance, and there is no evidence,\r\nnotwithstanding the lapse of time, that a change of disposition in the\r\nBritish councils has taken place or is to be expected.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances a nation proud of its rights and conscious of\r\nits strength has no choice but an exertion of the one in support of the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nTo this determination the best encouragement is derived from the success\r\nwith which it has pleased the Almighty to bless our arms both on the\r\nland and on the water.\r\n\r\nWhilst proofs have been continued of the enterprise and skill of our\r\ncruisers, public and private, on the ocean, and a new trophy gained in\r\nthe capture of a British by an American vessel of war, after an action\r\ngiving celebrity to the name of the victorious commander, the great\r\ninland waters on which the enemy were also to be encountered have\r\npresented achievements of our naval arms as brilliant in their character\r\nas they have been important in their consequences.\r\n\r\nOn Lake Erie, the squadron under command of Captain Perry having met the\r\nBritish squadron of superior force, a sanguinary conflict ended in the\r\ncapture of the whole. The conduct of that officer, adroit as it was\r\ndaring, and which was so well seconded by his comrades, justly entitles\r\nthem to the admiration and gratitude of their country, and will fill an\r\nearly page in its naval annals with a victory never surpassed in luster,\r\nhowever much it may have been in magnitude.\r\n\r\nOn Lake Ontario the caution of the British commander, favored by\r\ncontingencies, frustrated the efforts of the American commander to bring\r\non a decisive action. Captain Chauncey was able, however, to establish\r\nan ascendency on that important theater, and to prove by the manner\r\nin which he effected everything possible that opportunities only were\r\nwanted for a more shining display of his own talents and the gallantry\r\nof those under his command.\r\n\r\nThe success on Lake Erie having opened a passage to the territory of the\r\nenemy, the officer commanding the Northwestern army transferred the war\r\nthither, and rapidly pursuing the hostile troops, fleeing with their\r\nsavage associates, forced a general action, which quickly terminated in\r\nthe capture of the British and dispersion of the savage force.\r\n\r\nThis result is signally honorable to Major General Harrison, by whose\r\nmilitary talents it was prepared; to Colonel Johnson and his mounted\r\nvolunteers, whose impetuous onset gave a decisive blow to the ranks of\r\nthe enemy, and to the spirit of the volunteer militia, equally brave and\r\npatriotic, who bore an interesting part in the scene; more especially to\r\nthe chief magistrate of Kentucky, at the head of them, whose heroism\r\nsignalized in the war which established the independence of his country,\r\nsought at an advanced age a share in hardships and battles for\r\nmaintaining its rights and its safety.\r\n\r\nThe effect of these successes has been to rescue the inhabitants of\r\nMichigan from their oppressions, aggravated by gross infractions of\r\nthe capitulation which subjected them to a foreign power; to alienate\r\nthe savages of numerous tribes from the enemy, by whom they were\r\ndisappointed and abandoned, and to relieve an extensive region of\r\ncountry from a merciless warfare which desolated its frontiers and\r\nimposed on its citizens the most harassing services.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of our naval superiority on Lake Ontario and the\r\nopportunity afforded by it for concentrating our forces by water,\r\noperations which had been provisionally planned were set on foot against\r\nthe possessions of the enemy on the St. Lawrence. Such, however, was the\r\ndelay produced in the first instance by adverse weather of unusual\r\nviolence and continuance and such the circumstances attending the final\r\nmovements of the army, that the prospect, at one time so favorable, was\r\nnot realized.\r\n\r\nThe cruelty of the enemy in enlisting the savages into a war with a\r\nnation desirous of mutual emulation in mitigating its calamities has not\r\nbeen confined to any one quarter. Wherever they could be turned against\r\nus no exertions to effect it have been spared. On our southwestern\r\nborder the Creek tribes, who, yielding to our persevering endeavors,\r\nwere gradually acquiring more civilized habits, became the unfortunate\r\nvictims of seduction. A war in that quarter has been the consequence,\r\ninfuriated by a bloody fanaticism recently propagated among them. It\r\nwas necessary to crush such a war before it could spread among the\r\ncontiguous tribes and before it could favor enterprises of the enemy\r\ninto that vicinity. With this view a force was called into the service\r\nof the United States from the States of Georgia and Tennessee, which,\r\nwith the nearest regular troops and other corps from the Mississippi\r\nTerritory, might not only chastise the savages into present peace but\r\nmake a lasting impression on their fears.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the expedition, as far as is yet known, corresponds with\r\nthe martial zeal with which it was espoused, and the best hopes of a\r\nsatisfactory issue are authorized by the complete success with which a\r\nwell-planned enterprise was executed against a body of hostile savages\r\nby a detachment of the volunteer militia of Tennessee, under the gallant\r\ncommand of General Coffee, and by a still more important victory over a\r\nlarger body of them, gained under the immediate command of Major General\r\nJackson, an officer equally distinguished for his patriotism and his\r\nmilitary talents.\r\n\r\nThe systematic perseverance of the enemy in courting the aid of the\r\nsavages in all quarters had the natural effect of kindling their\r\nordinary propensity to war into a passion, which, even among those\r\nbest disposed toward the United States, was ready, if not employed\r\non our side, to be turned against us. A departure from our protracted\r\nforbearance to accept the services tendered by them has thus been forced\r\nupon us. But in yielding to it the retaliation has been mitigated as\r\nmuch as possible, both in its extent and in its character, stopping far\r\nshort of the example of the enemy, who owe the advantages they have\r\noccasionally gained in battle chiefly to the number of their savage\r\nassociates, and who have not controlled them either from their usual\r\npractice of indiscriminate massacre on defenseless inhabitants or from\r\nscenes of carnage without a parallel on prisoners to the British arms,\r\nguarded by all the laws of humanity and of honorable war. For these\r\nenormities the enemy are equally responsible, whether with the power to\r\nprevent them they want the will or with the knowledge of a want of power\r\nthey still avail themselves of such instruments.\r\n\r\nIn other respects the enemy are pursuing a course which threatens\r\nconsequences most afflicting to humanity.\r\n\r\nA standing law of Great Britain naturalizes, as is well known, all\r\naliens complying with conditions limited to a shorter period than\r\nthose required by the United States, and naturalized subjects are\r\nin war employed by her Government in common with native subjects.\r\nIn a contiguous British Province regulations promulgated since the\r\ncommencement of the war compel citizens of the United States being there\r\nunder certain circumstances to bear arms, whilst of the native emigrants\r\nfrom the United States, who compose much of the population of the\r\nProvince, a number have actually borne arms against the United States\r\nwithin their limits, some of whom, after having done so, have become\r\nprisoners of war, and are now in our possession. The British commander\r\nin that Province, nevertheless, with the sanction, as appears, of his\r\nGovernment, thought proper to select from American prisoners of war and\r\nsend to Great Britain for trial as criminals a number of individuals who\r\nhad emigrated from the British dominions long prior to the state of war\r\nbetween the two nations, who had incorporated themselves into our\r\npolitical society in the modes recognized by the law and the practice of\r\nGreat Britain, and who were made prisoners of war under the banners of\r\ntheir adopted country, fighting for its rights and its safety.\r\n\r\nThe protection due to these citizens requiring an effectual\r\ninterposition in their behalf, a like number of British prisoners of\r\nwar were put into confinement, with a notification that they would\r\nexperience whatever violence might be committed on the American\r\nprisoners of war sent to Great Britain.\r\n\r\nIt was hoped that this necessary consequence of the step unadvisedly\r\ntaken on the part of Great Britain would have led her Government to\r\nreflect on the inconsistencies of its conduct, and that a sympathy with\r\nthe British, if not with the American, sufferers would have arrested the\r\ncruel career opened by its example.\r\n\r\nThis was unhappily not the case. In violation both of consistency and of\r\nhumanity, American officers and noncommissioned officers in double the\r\nnumber of the British soldiers confined here were ordered into close\r\nconfinement, with formal notice that in the event of a retaliation for\r\nthe death which might be inflicted on the prisoners of war sent to Great\r\nBritain for trial the officers so confined would be put to death also.\r\nIt was notified at the same time that the commanders of the British\r\nfleets and armies on our coasts are instructed in the same event to\r\nproceed with a destructive severity against our towns and their\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nThat no doubt might be left with the enemy of our adherence to the\r\nretaliatory resort imposed on us, a correspondent number of British\r\nofficers, prisoners of war in our hands, were immediately put into close\r\nconfinement to abide the fate of those confined by the enemy, and the\r\nBritish Government has been apprised of the determination of this\r\nGovernment to retaliate any other proceedings against us contrary to\r\nthe legitimate modes of warfare.\r\n\r\nIt is as fortunate for the United States that they have it in their\r\npower to meet the enemy in this deplorable contest as it is honorable\r\nto them that they do not join in it but under the most imperious\r\nobligations, and with the humane purpose of effectuating a return to\r\nthe established usages of war.\r\n\r\nThe views of the French Government on the subjects which have been so\r\nlong committed to negotiation have received no elucidation since the\r\nclose of your late session. The minister plenipotentiary of the United\r\nStates at Paris had not been enabled by proper opportunities to press\r\nthe objects of his mission as prescribed by his instructions.\r\n\r\nThe militia being always to be regarded as the great bulwark of defense\r\nand security for free states, and the Constitution having wisely\r\ncommitted to the national authority a use of that force as the best\r\nprovision against an unsafe military establishment, as well as a\r\nresource peculiarly adapted to a country having the extent and the\r\nexposure of the United States, I recommend to Congress a revision of the\r\nmilitia laws for the purpose of securing more effectually the services\r\nof all detachments called into the employment and placed under the\r\nGovernment of the United States.\r\n\r\nIt will deserve the consideration of Congress also whether among other\r\nimprovements in the militia laws justice does not require a regulation,\r\nunder due precautions, for defraying the expense incident to the first\r\nassembling as well as the subsequent movements of detachments called\r\ninto the national service.\r\n\r\nTo give to our vessels of war, public and private, the requisite\r\nadvantage in their cruises, it is of much importance that they should\r\nhave, both for themselves and their prizes, the use of the ports and\r\nmarkets of friendly powers. With this view, I recommend to Congress the\r\nexpediency of such legal provisions as may supply the defects or remove\r\nthe doubts of the Executive authority, to allow to the cruisers of other\r\npowers at war with enemies of the United States such use of the American\r\nports as may correspond with the privileges allowed by such powers to\r\nAmerican cruisers.\r\n\r\nDuring the year ending on the 30th of September last the receipts into\r\nthe Treasury have exceeded $37,500,000, of which near twenty-four\r\nmillions were the produce of loans. After meeting all demands for\r\nthe public service there remained in the Treasury on that day near\r\n$7,000,000. Under the authority contained in the act of the 2d of August\r\nlast for borrowing $7,500,000, that sum has been obtained on terms more\r\nfavorable to the United States than those of the preceding loan made\r\nduring the present year. Further sums to a considerable amount will be\r\nnecessary to be obtained in the same way during the ensuing year, and\r\nfrom the increased capital of the country, from the fidelity with which\r\nthe public engagements have been kept and the public credit maintained,\r\nit may be expected on good grounds that the necessary pecuniary supplies\r\nwill not be wanting.\r\n\r\nThe expenses of the current year, from the multiplied operations falling\r\nwithin it, have necessarily been extensive; but on a just estimate of\r\nthe campaign in which the mass of them has been incurred the cost will\r\nnot be found disproportionate to the advantages which have been gained.\r\nThe campaign has, indeed, in its latter stages in one quarter been less\r\nfavorable than was expected, but in addition to the importance of our\r\nnaval success the progress of the campaign has been filled with\r\nincidents highly honorable to the American arms.\r\n\r\nThe attacks of the enemy on Craney Island, on Fort Meigs, on Sacketts\r\nHarbor, and on Sandusky have been vigorously and successfully repulsed;\r\nnor have they in any case succeeded on either frontier excepting when\r\ndirected against the peaceable dwellings of individuals or villages\r\nunprepared or undefended.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the movements of the American Army have been followed\r\nby the reduction of York, and of Forts George, Erie, and Maiden; by the\r\nrecovery of Detroit and the extinction of the Indian war in the West,\r\nand by the occupancy or command of a large portion of Upper Canada.\r\nBattles have also been fought on the borders of the St. Lawrence, which,\r\nthough not accomplishing their entire objects, reflect honor on the\r\ndiscipline and prowess of our soldiery, the best auguries of eventual\r\nvictory. In the same scale are to be placed the late successes in the\r\nSouth over one of the most powerful, which had become one of the most\r\nhostile also, of the Indian tribes.\r\n\r\nIt would be improper to close this communication without expressing a\r\nthankfulness in which all ought to unite for the numerous blessings\r\nwith which our beloved country continues to be favored; for the\r\nabundance which overspreads our land, and the prevailing health of its\r\ninhabitants; for the preservation of our internal tranquillity, and\r\nthe stability of our free institutions, and, above all, for the light\r\nof divine truth and the protection of every man's conscience in the\r\nenjoyment of it. And although among our blessings we can not number an\r\nexemption from the evils of war, yet these will never be regarded as\r\nthe greatest of evils by the friends of liberty and of the rights of\r\nnations. Our country has before preferred them to the degraded condition\r\nwhich was the alternative when the sword was drawn in the cause which\r\ngave birth to our national independence, and none who contemplate the\r\nmagnitude and feel the value of that glorious event will shrink from a\r\nstruggle to maintain the high and happy ground on which it placed the\r\nAmerican people.\r\n\r\nWith all good citizens the justice and necessity of resisting wrongs\r\nand usurpations no longer to be borne will sufficiently outweigh the\r\nprivations and sacrifices inseparable from a state of war. But it\r\nis a reflection, moreover, peculiarly consoling, that, whilst wars\r\nare generally aggravated by their baneful effects on the internal\r\nimprovements and permanent prosperity of the nations engaged in them,\r\nsuch is the favored situation of the United States that the calamities\r\nof the contest into which they have been compelled to enter are\r\nmitigated by improvements and advantages of which the contest itself\r\nis the source.\r\n\r\nIf the war has increased the interruptions of our commerce, it has at\r\nthe same time cherished and multiplied our manufactures so as to make us\r\nindependent of all other countries for the more essential branches for\r\nwhich we ought to be dependent on none, and is even rapidly giving them\r\nan extent which will create additional staples in our future intercourse\r\nwith foreign markets.\r\n\r\nIf much treasure has been expended, no inconsiderable portion of it has\r\nbeen applied to objects durable in their value and necessary to our\r\npermanent safety.\r\n\r\nIf the war has exposed us to increased spoliations on the ocean and to\r\npredatory incursions on the land, it has developed the national means of\r\nretaliating the former and of providing protection against the latter,\r\ndemonstrating to all that every blow aimed at our maritime independence\r\nis an impulse accelerating the growth of our maritime power.\r\n\r\nBy diffusing through the mass of the nation the elements of military\r\ndiscipline and instruction; by augmenting and distributing warlike\r\npreparations applicable to future use; by evincing the zeal and valor\r\nwith which they will be employed and the cheerfulness with which every\r\nnecessary burden will be borne, a greater respect for our rights and a\r\nlonger duration of our future peace are promised than could be expected\r\nwithout these proofs of the national character and resources.\r\n\r\nThe war has proved moreover that our free Government, like other free\r\ngovernments, though slow in its early movements, acquires in its\r\nprogress a force proportioned to its freedom, and that the union of\r\nthese States, the guardian of the freedom and safety of all and of each,\r\nis strengthened by every occasion that puts it to the test.\r\n\r\nIn fine, the war, with all its vicissitudes, is illustrating the\r\ncapacity and the destiny of the United States to be a great, a\r\nflourishing, and a powerful nation, worthy of the friendship which it\r\nis disposed to cultivate with all others, and authorized by its own\r\nexample to require from all an observance of the laws of justice and\r\nreciprocity. Beyond these their claims have never extended, and in\r\ncontending for these we behold a subject for our congratulations in the\r\ndaily testimonies of increasing harmony throughout the nation, and may\r\nhumbly repose our trust in the smiles of Heaven on so righteous a cause.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 9, 1813.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe tendency of our commercial and navigation laws in their present\r\nstate to favor the enemy and thereby prolong the war is more and more\r\ndeveloped by experience. Supplies of the most essential kinds And their\r\nway not only to British ports and British armies at a distance, but the\r\narmies in our neighborhood with which our own are contending derive from\r\nour ports and outlets a subsistence attainable with difficulty, if at\r\nall, from other sources. Even the fleets and troops infesting our coasts\r\nand waters are by like supplies accommodated and encouraged in their\r\npredatory and incursive warfare.\r\n\r\nAbuses having a like tendency take place in our import trade. British\r\nfabrics and products find their way into our ports under the name and\r\nfrom the ports of other countries, and often in British vessels\r\ndisguised as neutrals by false colors and papers.\r\n\r\nTo these abuses it may be added that illegal importations are openly\r\nmade with advantage to the violators of the law, produced by\r\nundervaluations or other circumstances involved in the course of the\r\njudicial proceedings against them.\r\n\r\nIt is found also that the practice of ransoming is a cover for collusive\r\ncaptures and a channel for intelligence advantageous to the enemy.\r\n\r\nTo remedy as much as possible these evils, I recommend:\r\n\r\nThat an effectual embargo on exports be immediately enacted.\r\n\r\nThat all articles known to be derived, either not at all or in any\r\nimmaterial degree only, from the productions of any other country than\r\nGreat Britain, and particularly the extensive articles made of wool and\r\ncotton materials, and ardent spirits made from the cane, be expressly\r\nand absolutely prohibited, from whatever port or place or in whatever\r\nvessels the same may be brought into the United States, and that all\r\nviolations of the nonimportation act be subjected to adequate penalties.\r\n\r\nThat among the proofs of the neutral and national character of\r\nforeign vessels it be required that the masters and supercargoes and\r\nthree-fourths at least of the crews be citizens or subjects of the\r\ncountry under whose flag the vessels sail.\r\n\r\nThat all persons concerned in collusive captures by the enemy or in\r\nransoming vessels or their cargoes from the enemy be subjected to\r\nadequate penalties.\r\n\r\nTo shorten as much as possible the duration of the war it is\r\nindispensable that the enemy should feel all the pressure that can be\r\ngiven to it, and the restraints having that tendency will be borne with\r\nthe greater cheerfulness by all good citizens, as the restraints will\r\naffect those most who are most ready to sacrifice the interest of their\r\ncountry in pursuit of their own.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 6, 1814.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit, for the information of Congress, copies of a letter from the\r\nBritish secretary of state for foreign affairs to the Secretary of\r\nState, with the answer of the latter.\r\n\r\nIn appreciating the accepted proposal of the Government of Great Britain\r\nfor instituting negotiations for peace Congress will not fail to keep in\r\nmind that vigorous preparations for carrying on the war can in no\r\nrespect impede the progress to a favorable result, whilst a relaxation\r\nof such preparations, should the wishes of the United States for a\r\nspeedy restoration of the blessings of peace be disappointed, would\r\nnecessarily have the most injurious consequences.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 26, 1814.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIt has appeared that at the recovery of the Michigan Territory from the\r\ntemporary possession of the enemy the inhabitants thereof were left in\r\nso destitute and distressed a condition as to require from the public\r\nstores certain supplies essential to their subsistence, which have been\r\nprolonged under the same necessity which called for them.\r\n\r\nThe deplorable situation of the savages thrown by the same event on the\r\nmercy and humanity of the American commander at Detroit drew from the\r\nsame source the means of saving them from perishing by famine, and in\r\nother places the appeals made by the wants and sufferings of that\r\nunhappy description of people have been equally imperious.\r\n\r\nThe necessity imposed by the conduct of the enemy in relation to the\r\nsavages of admitting their cooperation in some instances with our arms\r\nhas also involved occasional expense in supplying their wants, and it\r\nis possible that a perseverance of the enemy in their cruel policy may\r\nrender a further expense for the like purpose inevitable.\r\n\r\nOn these subjects an estimate from the Department of War will be laid\r\nbefore Congress, and I recommend a suitable provision for them.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 31, 1814.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nTaking into view the mutual interests which the United States and\r\nthe foreign nations in amity with them have in a liberal commercial\r\nintercourse, and the extensive changes favorable thereto which have\r\nrecently taken place; taking into view also the important advantages\r\nwhich may otherwise result from adapting the state of our commercial\r\nlaws to the circumstances now existing, I recommend to the consideration\r\nof Congress the expediency of authorizing, after a certain day,\r\nexportations, specie excepted, from the United States in vessels of the\r\nUnited States and in vessels owned and navigated by the subjects of\r\npowers at peace with them, and a repeal of so much of our laws as\r\nprohibits the importation of articles not the property of enemies, but\r\nproduced or manufactured only within their dominions.\r\n\r\nI recommend also, as a more effectual safeguard and encouragement to our\r\ngrowing manufactures, that the additional duties on imports which are\r\nto expire at the end of one year after a peace with Great Britain be\r\nprolonged to the end of two years after that event, and that, in favor\r\nof our moneyed institutions, the exportation of specie be prohibited\r\nthroughout the same period.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[From Niles's Weekly Register, vol. 6, p. 279.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas information has been received that a number of individuals who\r\nhave deserted from the Army of the United States have become sensible of\r\ntheir offenses and are desirous of returning to their duty, a full\r\npardon is hereby granted and proclaimed to each and all such individuals\r\nas shall within three months from the date hereof surrender themselves\r\nto the commanding officer of any military post within the United States\r\nor the Territories thereof.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have caused the seal of the United States to be\r\naffixed to these presents, and signed the same with my hand.\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, the 17th day of June, A.D. 1814, and of\r\nthe Independence of the United States the thirty eighth.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  JAMES MONROE,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas it is manifest that the blockade which has been proclaimed by\r\nthe enemy of the whole Atlantic coast of the United States, nearly 2,000\r\nmiles in extent, and abounding in ports, harbors, and navigable inlets,\r\ncan not be carried into effect by any adequate force actually stationed\r\nfor the purpose, and it is rendered a matter of certainty and notoriety\r\nby the multiplied and daily arrivals and departures of the public and\r\nprivate armed vessels of the United States and of other vessels that no\r\nsuch adequate force has been so stationed; and\r\n\r\nWhereas a blockade thus destitute of the character of a regular and\r\nlegal blockade as defined and recognized by the established law of\r\nnations, whatever other purposes it may be made to answer, forms no\r\nlawful prohibition or obstacle to such neutral and friendly vessels\r\nas may choose to visit and trade with the United States; and\r\n\r\nWhereas it accords with the interest and the amicable views of the\r\nUnited States to favor and promote as far as may be the free and\r\nmutually beneficial commercial intercourse of all friendly nations\r\ndisposed to engage therein, and with that view to afford to their\r\nvessels destined to the United States a more positive and satisfactory\r\nsecurity against all interruptions, molestations, or vexations whatever\r\nfrom the cruisers of the United States:\r\n\r\nNow be it known that I, James Madison, President of the United States of\r\nAmerica, do by this my proclamation strictly order and instruct all the\r\npublic armed vessels of the United States and all private armed vessels\r\ncommissioned as privateers or with letters of marque and reprisal not\r\nto interrupt, detain, or otherwise molest or vex any vessels whatever\r\nbelonging to neutral powers or the subjects or citizens thereof, which\r\nvessels shall be actually bound and proceeding to any port or place\r\nwithin the jurisdiction of the United States, but, on the contrary, to\r\nrender to all such vessels all the aid and kind offices which they may\r\nneed or require.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand and the seal of the United States at the city of\r\nWashington, the 29th day of June, A.D. 1814, and of the Independence\r\nof the United States the thirty-eighth.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  JAMES MONROE,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From Annals of Congress, Thirteenth Congress, vol. 3, 9.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas great and weighty matters claiming the consideration of the\r\nCongress of the United States form an extraordinary occasion for\r\nconvening them, I do by these presents appoint Monday, the 19th day of\r\nSeptember next, for their meeting at the city of Washington, hereby\r\nrequiring the respective Senators and Representatives then and there to\r\nassemble in Congress, in order to receive such communications as may\r\nthen be made to them and to consult and determine on such measures as in\r\ntheir wisdom may be deemed meet for the welfare of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have caused the seal of the United States to be\r\nhereunto affixed, and signed the same with my hand,\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, the 8th day of August, A.D. 1814, and of\r\nthe Independence of the United States the thirty-ninth.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  JAMES MONROE,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From Nile's Weekly Register, vol. 7, p. 2.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas the enemy by a sudden incursion have succeeded in invading the\r\ncapital of the nation, defended at the moment by troops less numerous\r\nthan their own and almost entirely of the militia, during their\r\npossession of which, though for a single day only, they wantonly\r\ndestroyed the public edifices, having no relation in their structure to\r\noperations of war nor used at the time for military annoyance, some of\r\nthese edifices being also costly monuments of taste and of the arts, and\r\nothers depositories of the public archives, not only precious to the\r\nnation as the memorials of its origin and its early transactions, but\r\ninteresting to all nations as contributions to the general stock of\r\nhistorical instruction and political science; and\r\n\r\nWhereas advantage has been taken of the loss of a fort more immediately\r\nguarding the neighboring town of Alexandria to place the town within the\r\nrange of a naval force too long and too much in the habit of abusing its\r\nsuperiority wherever it can be applied to require as the alternative of\r\na general conflagration an undisturbed plunder of private property,\r\nwhich has been executed in a manner peculiarly distressing to the\r\ninhabitants, who had inconsiderately cast themselves upon the justice\r\nand generosity of the victor; and\r\n\r\nWhereas it now appears by a direct communication from the British\r\ncommander on the American station to be his avowed purpose to employ the\r\nforce under his direction \"in destroying and laying waste such towns and\r\ndistricts upon the coast as may be found assailable,\" adding to this\r\ndeclaration the insulting pretext that it is in retaliation for a wanton\r\ndestruction committed by the army of the United States in Upper Canada,\r\nwhen it is notorious that no destruction has been committed, which,\r\nnotwithstanding the multiplied outrages previously committed by the\r\nenemy was not unauthorized, and promptly shown to be so, and that the\r\nUnited States have been as constant in their endeavors to reclaim the\r\nenemy from such outrages by the contrast of their own example as they\r\nhave been ready to terminate on reasonable conditions the war itself;\r\nand\r\n\r\nWhereas these proceedings and declared purposes, which exhibit a\r\ndeliberate disregard of the principles of humanity and the rules of\r\ncivilized warfare, and which must give to the existing war a character\r\nof extended devastation and barbarism at the very moment of negotiations\r\nfor peace, invited by the enemy himself, leave no prospect of safety to\r\nanything within the reach of his predatory and incendiary operations but\r\nin manful and universal determination to chastise and expel the invader:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, James Madison, President of the United States, do\r\nissue this my proclamation, exhorting all the good people thereof to\r\nunite their hearts and hands in giving effect to the ample means\r\npossessed for that purpose. I enjoin it on all officers, civil and\r\nmilitary, to exert themselves in executing the duties with which they\r\nare respectively charged; and more especially I require the officers\r\ncommanding the respective military districts to be vigilant and alert in\r\nproviding for the defense thereof, for the more effectual accomplishment\r\nof which they are authorized to call to the defense of exposed and\r\nthreatened places portions of the militia most convenient thereto,\r\nwhether they be or be not parts of the quotas detached for the service\r\nof the United States under requisitions of the General Government.\r\n\r\nOn an occasion which appeals so forcibly to the proud feelings and\r\npatriotic devotion of the American people none will forget what they\r\nowe to themselves, what they owe to their country and the high destinies\r\nwhich await it, what to the glory acquired by their fathers in\r\nestablishing the independence which is now to be maintained by their\r\nsons with the augmented strength and resources with which time and\r\nHeaven had blessed them.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed to these presents.

If, on the one hand, the repeal of the\r\norders in council and the general pacification in Europe, which withdrew\r\nthe occasion on which impressments from American vessels were practiced,\r\nsuggest expectations that peace and amity may be reestablished, we are\r\ncompelled, on the other hand, by the refusal of the British Government\r\nto accept the offered mediation of the Emperor of Russia, by the delays\r\nin giving effect to its own proposal of a direct negotiation, and, above\r\nall, by the principles and manner in which the war is now avowedly\r\ncarried on to infer that a spirit of hostility is indulged more violent\r\nthan ever against the rights and prosperity of this country.\r\n\r\nThis increased violence is best explained by the two important\r\ncircumstances that the great contest in Europe for an equilibrium\r\nguaranteeing all its States against the ambition of any has been closed\r\nwithout any check on the overbearing power of Great Britain on the\r\nocean, and it has left in her hands disposable armaments, with which,\r\nforgetting the difficulties of a remote war with a free people, and\r\nyielding to the intoxication of success, with the example of a great\r\nvictim to it before her eyes, she cherishes hopes of still further\r\naggrandizing a power already formidable in its abuses to the\r\ntranquillity of the civilized and commercial world.\r\n\r\nBut whatever may have inspired the enemy with these more violent\r\npurposes, the public councils of a nation more able to maintain than it\r\nwas to acquire its independence, and with a devotion to it rendered more\r\nardent by the experience of its blessings, can never deliberate but\r\non the means most effectual for defeating the extravagant views or\r\nunwarrantable passions with which alone the war can now be pursued\r\nagainst us.\r\n\r\nIn the events of the present campaign the enemy, with all his augmented\r\nmeans and wanton use of them, has little ground for exultation, unless\r\nhe can feel it in the success of his recent enterprises against this\r\nmetropolis and the neighboring town of Alexandria, from both of which\r\nhis retreats were as precipitate as his attempts were bold and\r\nfortunate. In his other incursions on our Atlantic frontier his\r\nprogress, often checked and chastised by the martial spirit of the\r\nneighboring citizens, has had more effect in distressing individuals\r\nand in dishonoring his arms than in promoting any object of legitimate\r\nwarfare; and in the two instances mentioned, however deeply to be\r\nregretted on our part, he will find in his transient success, which\r\ninterrupted for a moment only the ordinary public business at the seat\r\nof Government, no compensation for the loss of character with the world\r\nby his violations of private property and by his destruction of public\r\nedifices protected as monuments of the arts by the laws of civilized\r\nwarfare.\r\n\r\nOn our side we can appeal to a series of achievements which have given\r\nnew luster to the American arms. Besides the brilliant incidents in the\r\nminor operations of the campaign, the splendid victories gained on the\r\nCanadian side of the Niagara by the American forces under Major-General\r\nBrown and Brigadiers Scott and Gaines have gained for these heroes and\r\ntheir emulating companions the most unfading laurels, and, having\r\ntriumphantly tested the progressive discipline of the American soldiery,\r\nhave taught the enemy that the longer he protracts his hostile efforts\r\nthe more certain and decisive will be his final discomfiture.\r\n\r\nOn our southern border victory has continued also to follow the American\r\nstandard. The bold and skillful operations of Major-General Jackson,\r\nconducting troops drawn from the militia of the States least distant,\r\nparticularly of Tennessee, have subdued the principal tribes of hostile\r\nsavages, and, by establishing a peace with them, preceded by recent and\r\nexemplary chastisement, has best guarded against the mischief of their\r\ncooperation with the British enterprises which may be planned against\r\nthat quarter of our country. Important tribes of Indians on our\r\nnorthwestern frontier have also acceded to stipulations which bind them\r\nto the interests of the United States and to consider our enemy as\r\ntheirs also.\r\n\r\nIn the recent attempt of the enemy on the city of Baltimore, defended by\r\nmilitia and volunteers, aided by a small body of regulars and seamen, he\r\nwas received with a spirit which produced a rapid retreat to his ships,\r\nwhilst a concurrent attack by a large fleet was successfully resisted by\r\nthe steady and well-directed fire of the fort and batteries opposed to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn another recent attack by a powerful force on our troops at\r\nPlattsburg, of which regulars made a part only, the enemy, after a\r\nperseverance for many hours, was finally compelled to seek safety in a\r\nhasty retreat, with our gallant bands pressing upon him.\r\n\r\nOn the Lakes, so much contested throughout the war, the great exertions\r\nfor the command made on our part have been well repaid. On Lake Ontario\r\nour squadron is now and has been for some time in a condition to confine\r\nthat of the enemy to his own port, and to favor the operations of our\r\nland forces on that frontier.\r\n\r\nA part of the squadron on Lake Erie has been extended into Lake Huron,\r\nand has produced the advantage of displaying our command on that lake\r\nalso. One object of the expedition was the reduction of Mackinaw, which\r\nfailed with the loss of a few brave men, among whom was an officer\r\njustly distinguished for his gallant exploits. The expedition, ably\r\nconducted by both the land and the naval commanders, was otherwise\r\nhighly valuable in its effects.\r\n\r\nOn Lake Champlain, where our superiority had for some time been\r\nundisputed, the British squadron lately came into action with the\r\nAmerican, commanded by Captain Macdonough. It issued in the capture of\r\nthe whole of the enemy's ships. The best praise for this officer and his\r\nintrepid comrades is in the likeness of his triumph to the illustrious\r\nvictory which immortalized another officer and established at a critical\r\nmoment our command of another lake.\r\n\r\nOn the ocean the pride of our naval arms had been amply supported. A\r\nsecond frigate has indeed fallen into the hands of the enemy, but the\r\nloss is hidden in the blaze of heroism with which she was defended.\r\nCaptain Porter, who commanded her, and whose previous career had\r\nbeen distinguished by daring enterprise and by fertility of genius,\r\nmaintained a sanguinary contest against two ships, one of them superior\r\nto his own, and under other severe disadvantages, till humanity tore\r\ndown the colors which valor had nailed to the mast. This officer and his\r\nbrave comrades have added much to the rising glory of the American flag,\r\nand have merited all the effusions of gratitude which their country is\r\never ready to bestow on the champions of its rights and of its safety.\r\n\r\nTwo smaller vessels of war have also become prizes to the enemy, but by\r\na superiority of force which sufficiently vindicates the reputation\r\nof their commanders, whilst two others, one commanded by Captain\r\nWarrington, the other by Captain Blakely, have captured British ships of\r\nthe same class with a gallantry and good conduct which entitle them and\r\ntheir companions to a just share in the praise of their country.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the naval force of the enemy accumulated on our coasts, our\r\nprivate cruisers also have not ceased to annoy his commerce and to bring\r\ntheir rich prizes into our ports, contributing thus, with other proofs,\r\nto demonstrate the incompetency and illegality of a blockade the\r\nproclamation of which is made the pretext for vexing and discouraging\r\nthe commerce of neutral powers with the United States.\r\n\r\nTo meet the extended and diversified warfare adopted by the enemy, great\r\nbodies of militia have been taken into service for the public defense,\r\nand great expenses incurred. That the defense everywhere may be both\r\nmore convenient and more economical, Congress will see the necessity\r\nof immediate measures for filling the ranks of the Regular Army and of\r\nenlarging the provision for special corps, mounted and unmounted, to be\r\nengaged for longer periods of service than are due from the militia. I\r\nearnestly renew, at the same time, a recommendation of such changes in\r\nthe system of the militia as, by classing and disciplining for the most\r\nprompt and active service the portions most capable of it, will give to\r\nthat great resource for the public safety all the requisite energy and\r\nefficiency.\r\n\r\nThe moneys received into the Treasury during the nine months ending on\r\nthe 30th day of June last amounted to $32,000,000, of which near eleven\r\nmillions were the proceeds of the public revenue and the remainder\r\nderived from loans. The disbursements for public expenditures during the\r\nsame period exceeded $34,000,000, and left in the Treasury on the 1st\r\nday of July near $5,000,000. The demands during the remainder of the\r\npresent year already authorized by Congress and the expenses incident to\r\nan extension of the operations of the war will render it necessary that\r\nlarge sums should be provided to meet them.\r\n\r\nFrom this view of the national affairs Congress will be urged to take\r\nup without delay as well the subject of pecuniary supplies as that of\r\nmilitary force, and on a scale commensurate with the extent and the\r\ncharacter which the war has assumed. It is not to be disguised that the\r\nsituation of our country calls for its greatest efforts. Our enemy is\r\npowerful in men and in money, on the land and on the water. Availing\r\nhimself of fortuitous advantages, he is aiming with his undivided force\r\na deadly blow at our growing prosperity, perhaps at our national\r\nexistence. He has avowed his purpose of trampling on the usages of\r\ncivilized warfare, and given earnests of it in the plunder and wanton\r\ndestruction of private property. In his pride of maritime dominion and\r\nin his thirst of commercial monopoly he strikes with peculiar animosity\r\nat the progress of our navigation and of our manufactures. His barbarous\r\npolicy has not even spared those monuments of the arts and models of\r\ntaste with which our country had enriched and embellished its infant\r\nmetropolis. From such an adversary hostility in its greatest force and\r\nin its worst forms may be looked for. The American people will face it\r\nwith the undaunted spirit which in their revolutionary struggle defeated\r\nhis unrighteous projects. His threats and his barbarities, instead of\r\ndismay, will kindle in every bosom an indignation not to be extinguished\r\nbut in the disaster and expulsion of such cruel invaders. In providing\r\nthe means necessary the National Legislature will not distrust the\r\nheroic and enlightened patriotism of its constituents. They will\r\ncheerfully and proudly bear every burden of every kind which the safety\r\nand honor of the nation demand. We have seen them everywhere paying\r\ntheir taxes, direct and indirect, with the greatest promptness and\r\nalacrity. We see them rushing with enthusiasm to the scenes where danger\r\nand duty call. In offering their blood they give the surest pledge that\r\nno other tribute will be withheld.\r\n\r\nHaving forborne to declare war until to other aggressions had been added\r\nthe capture of nearly a thousand American vessels and the impressment of\r\nthousands of American seafaring citizens, and until a final declaration\r\nhad been made by the Government of Great Britain that her hostile\r\norders against our commerce would not be revoked but on conditions as\r\nimpossible as unjust, whilst it was known that these orders would not\r\notherwise cease but with a war which had lasted nearly twenty years, and\r\nwhich, according to appearances at that time, might last as many more;\r\nhaving manifested on every occasion and in every proper mode a sincere\r\ndesire to arrest the effusion of blood and meet our enemy on the ground\r\nof justice and reconciliation, our beloved country, in still opposing\r\nto his persevering hostility all its energies, with an undiminished\r\ndisposition toward peace and friendship on honorable terms, must carry\r\nwith it the good wishes of the impartial world and the best hopes of\r\nsupport from an omnipotent and kind Providence.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER 26, 1814.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress, for their information, copies of a letter from\r\nAdmiral Cochrane, commanding His Britannic Majesty's naval forces on the\r\nAmerican station, to the Secretary of State, with his answer, and of a\r\nreply from Admiral Cochrane.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _October 10, 1814_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI lay before Congress communications just received from the\r\nplenipotentiaries of the United States charged with negotiating peace\r\nwith Great Britain, showing the conditions on which alone that\r\nGovernment is willing to put an end to the war.\r\n\r\nThe instructions to those plenipotentiaries, disclosing the grounds on\r\nwhich they were authorized to negotiate and conclude a treaty of peace,\r\nwill be the subject of another communication.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _October 13, 1814_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI now transmit to Congress copies of the instructions to the\r\nplenipotentiaries of the United States charged with negotiating a peace\r\nwith Great Britain, as referred to in my message of the 10th instant.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 1,  1814.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit, for the information of Congress, the communications last\r\nreceived from the ministers extraordinary and plenipotentiary of the\r\nUnited States at Ghent, explaining the course and actual state of their\r\nnegotiations with the plenipotentiaries of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 15, 1815.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have received from the American commissioners a treaty of peace and\r\namity between His Britannic Majesty and the United States of America,\r\nsigned by those commissioners and by the commissioners of His Britannic\r\nMajesty at Ghent on the 24th of December, 1814. The termination of\r\nhostilities depends upon the time of the ratification of the treaty by\r\nboth parties. I lose no time, therefore, in submitting the treaty to the\r\nSenate for their advice and approbation.\r\n\r\nI transmit also a letter from the American commissioners, which\r\naccompanied the treaty.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 18, 1815_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI lay before Congress copies of the treaty of peace and amity between\r\nthe United States and His Britannic Majesty, which was signed by the\r\ncommissioners of both parties at Ghent on the 24th of December, 1814,\r\nand the ratifications of which have been duly exchanged.\r\n\r\nWhile performing this act I congratulate you and our constituents upon\r\nan event which is highly honorable to the nation, and terminates with\r\npeculiar felicity a campaign signalized by the most brilliant successes.\r\n\r\nThe late war, although reluctantly declared by Congress, had become a\r\nnecessary resort to assert the rights and independence of the nation. It\r\nhas been waged with a success which is the natural result of the wisdom\r\nof the legislative councils, of the patriotism of the people, of the\r\npublic spirit of the militia, and of the valor of the military and naval\r\nforces of the country. Peace, at all times a blessing, is peculiarly\r\nwelcome, therefore, at a period when the causes for the war have ceased\r\nto operate, when the Government has demonstrated the efficiency of its\r\npowers of defense, and when the nation can review its conduct without\r\nregret and without reproach.\r\n\r\nI recommend to your care and beneficence the gallant men whose\r\nachievements in every department of the military service, on the land\r\nand on the water, have so essentially contributed to the honor of the\r\nAmerican name and to the restoration of peace. The feelings of conscious\r\npatriotism and worth will animate such men under every change of fortune\r\nand pursuit, but their country performs a duty to itself when it bestows\r\nthose testimonials of approbation and applause which are at once the\r\nreward and the incentive to great actions.\r\n\r\nThe reduction of the public expenditures to the demands of a peace\r\nestablishment will doubtless engage the immediate attention of Congress.\r\nThere are, however, important considerations which forbid a sudden and\r\ngeneral revocation of the measures that have been produced by the war.\r\nExperience has taught us that neither the pacific dispositions of\r\nthe American people nor the pacific character of their political\r\ninstitutions can altogether exempt them from that strife which appears\r\nbeyond the ordinary lot of nations to be incident to the actual period\r\nof the world, and the same faithful monitor demonstrates that a certain\r\ndegree of preparation for war is not only indispensable to avert\r\ndisasters in the onset, but affords also the best security for the\r\ncontinuance of peace. The wisdom of Congress will therefore, I am\r\nconfident, provide for the maintenance of an adequate regular force; for\r\nthe gradual advancement of the naval establishment; for improving all\r\nthe means of harbor defense; for adding discipline to the distinguished\r\nbravery of the militia, and for cultivating the military art in its\r\nessential branches, under the liberal patronage of Government.\r\n\r\nThe resources of our country were at all times competent to the\r\nattainment of every national object, but they will now be enriched and\r\ninvigorated by the activity which peace will introduce into all the\r\nscenes of domestic enterprise and labor. The provision that has been\r\nmade for the public creditors during the present session of Congress\r\nmust have a decisive effect in the establishment of the public credit\r\nboth at home and abroad. The reviving interests of commerce will\r\nclaim the legislative attention at the earliest opportunity, and such\r\nregulations will, I trust, be seasonably devised as shall secure to the\r\nUnited States their just proportion of the navigation of the world.\r\nThe most liberal policy toward other nations, if met by corresponding\r\ndispositions, will in this respect be found the most beneficial policy\r\ntoward ourselves. But there is no subject that can enter with greater\r\nforce and merit into the deliberations of Congress than a consideration\r\nof the means to preserve and promote the manufactures which have sprung\r\ninto existence and attained an unparalleled maturity throughout the\r\nUnited States during the period of the European wars. This source of\r\nnational independence and wealth I anxiously recommend, therefore, to\r\nthe prompt and constant guardianship of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe termination of the legislative sessions will soon separate you,\r\nfellow citizens, from each other, and restore you to your constituents.\r\nI pray you to bear with you the expressions of my sanguine hope that\r\nthe peace which has been just declared will not only be the foundation\r\nof the most friendly intercourse between the United States and Great\r\nBritain, but that it will also be productive of happiness and harmony in\r\nevery section of our beloved country. The influence of your precepts and\r\nexample must be everywhere powerful, and while we accord in grateful\r\nacknowledgments for the protection which Providence has bestowed upon\r\nus, let us never cease to inculcate obedience to the laws and fidelity\r\nto the Union as constituting the palladium of the national independence\r\nand prosperity.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 22, 1815_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI lay before Congress copies of two ratified treaties which were entered\r\ninto on the part of the United States, one on the 22d day of July, 1814,\r\nwith the several tribes of Indians called the Wyandots, Delawares,\r\nShawanees, Senakas, and Miamies; the other on the 9th day of August,\r\n1814, with the Creek Nation of Indians.\r\n\r\nIt is referred to the consideration of Congress how far legislative\r\nprovisions may be necessary for carrying any part of these stipulations\r\ninto effect.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 23, 1815_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nCongress will have seen by the communication from the consul-general of\r\nthe United States at Algiers laid before them on the 17th of November,\r\n1812, the hostile proceedings of the Dey against that functionary. These\r\nhave been followed by acts of more overt and direct warfare against the\r\ncitizens of the United States trading in the Mediterranean, some of whom\r\nare still detained in captivity, notwithstanding the attempts which have\r\nbeen made to ransom them, and are treated with the rigor usual on the\r\ncoast of Barbary.\r\n\r\nThe considerations which rendered it unnecessary and unimportant to\r\ncommence hostile operations on the part of the United States being now\r\nterminated by the peace with Great Britain, which opens the prospect of\r\nan active and valuable trade of their citizens within the range of the\r\nAlgerine cruisers, I recommend to Congress the expediency of an act\r\ndeclaring the existence of a state of war between the United States\r\nand the Dey and Regency of Algiers, and of such provisions as may be\r\nrequisite for a vigorous prosecution of it to a successful issue.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 25, 1815_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nPeace having happily taken place between the United States and Great\r\nBritain, it is desirable to guard against incidents which during periods\r\nof war in Europe might tend to interrupt it, and it is believed in\r\nparticular that the navigation of American vessels exclusively by\r\nAmerican seamen, either natives or such as are already naturalized,\r\nwould not only conduce to the attainment of that object, but also to\r\nincrease the number of our seamen, and consequently to render our\r\ncommerce and navigation independent of the service of foreigners who\r\nmight be recalled by their governments under circumstances the most\r\ninconvenient to the United States. I recommend the subject, therefore,\r\nto the consideration of Congress, and in deciding upon it I am persuaded\r\nthat they will sufficiently estimate the policy of manifesting to the\r\nworld a desire on all occasions to cultivate harmony with other nations\r\nby any reasonable accommodations which do not impair the enjoyment\r\nof any of the essential rights of a free and independent people. The\r\nexample on the part of the American Government will merit and may be\r\nexpected to receive a reciprocal attention from all the friendly powers\r\nof Europe.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETO MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 30, 1815_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nHaving bestowed on the bill entitled \"An act to incorporate the\r\nsubscribers to the Bank of the United States of America\" that full\r\nconsideration which is due to the great importance of the subject, and\r\ndictated by the respect which I feel for the two Houses of Congress, I\r\nam constrained by a deep and solemn conviction that the bill ought not\r\nto become a law to return it to the Senate, in which it originated, with\r\nmy objections to the same.\r\n\r\nWaiving the question of the constitutional authority of the Legislature\r\nto establish an incorporated bank as being precluded in my judgment by\r\nrepeated recognitions under varied circumstances of the validity of such\r\nan institution in acts of the legislative, executive, and judicial\r\nbranches of the Government, accompanied by indications, in different\r\nmodes, of a concurrence of the general will of the nation, the proposed\r\nbank does not appear to be calculated to answer the purposes of reviving\r\nthe public credit, of providing a national medium of circulation, and of\r\naiding the Treasury by facilitating the indispensable anticipations of\r\nthe revenue and by affording to the public more durable loans.\r\n\r\n1. The capital of the bank is to be compounded of specie, of public\r\nstock, and of Treasury notes convertible into stock, with a certain\r\nproportion of each of which every subscriber is to furnish himself.\r\n\r\nThe amount of the stock to be subscribed will not, it is believed, be\r\nsufficient to produce in favor of the public credit any considerable or\r\nlasting elevation of the market price, whilst this may be occasionally\r\ndepressed by the bank itself if it should carry into the market the\r\nallowed proportion of its capital consisting of public stock in order to\r\nprocure specie, which it may find its account in procuring with some\r\nsacrifice on that part of its capital.\r\n\r\nNor will any adequate advantage arise to the public credit from the\r\nsubscription of Treasury notes. The actual issue of these notes nearly\r\nequals at present, and will soon exceed, the amount to be subscribed\r\nto the bank. The direct effect of this operation is simply to convert\r\nfifteen millions of Treasury notes into fifteen millions of 6 per cent\r\nstock, with the collateral effect of promoting an additional demand for\r\nTreasury notes beyond what might otherwise be negotiable.\r\n\r\nPublic credit might indeed be expected to derive advantage from the\r\nestablishment of a national bank, without regard to the formation of its\r\ncapital, if the full aid and cooperation of the institution were secured\r\nto the Government during the war and during the period of its fiscal\r\nembarrassments. But the bank proposed will be free from all legal\r\nobligation to cooperate with the public measures, and whatever might be\r\nthe patriotic disposition of its directors to contribute to the removal\r\nof those embarrassments, and to invigorate the prosecution of the war,\r\nfidelity to the pecuniary and general interest of the institution\r\naccording to their estimate of it might oblige them to decline a\r\nconnection of their operations with those of the National Treasury\r\nduring the continuance of the war and the difficulties incident to it.\r\nTemporary sacrifices of interest, though overbalanced by the future\r\nand permanent profits of the charter, not being requirable of right in\r\nbehalf of the public, might not be gratuitously made, and the bank would\r\nreap the full benefit of the grant, whilst the public would lose the\r\nequivalent expected from it; for it must be kept in view that the sole\r\ninducement to such a grant on the part of the public would be the\r\nprospect of substantial aids to its pecuniary means at the present\r\ncrisis and during the sequel of the war. It is evident that the stock of\r\nthe bank will on the return of peace, if not sooner, rise in the market\r\nto a value which, if the bank were established in a period of peace,\r\nwould authorize and obtain for the public a bonus to a very large\r\namount. In lieu of such a bonus the Government is fairly entitled to and\r\nought not to relinquish or risk the needful services of the bank under\r\nthe pressing circumstances of war.\r\n\r\n2. The bank as proposed to be constituted can not be relied on during\r\nthe war to provide a circulating medium nor to furnish loans or\r\nanticipations of the public revenue.\r\n\r\nWithout a medium the taxes can not be collected, and in the absence of\r\nspecie the medium understood to be the best substitute is that of notes\r\nissued by a national bank. The proposed bank will commence and conduct\r\nits operations under an obligation to pay its notes in specie, or be\r\nsubject to the loss of its charter. Without such an obligation the notes\r\nof the bank, though not exchangeable for specie, yet resting on good\r\npledges and performing the uses of specie in the payment of taxes and in\r\nother public transactions, would, as experience has ascertained, qualify\r\nthe bank to supply at once a circulating medium and pecuniary aids to\r\nthe Government. Under the fetters imposed by the bill it is manifest\r\nthat during the actual state of things, and probably during the war, the\r\nperiod particularly requiring such a medium and such a resource for\r\nloans and advances to the Government, notes for which the bank would be\r\ncompellable to give specie in exchange could not be kept in circulation.\r\nThe most the bank could effect, and the most it could be expected to\r\naim at, would be to keep the institution alive by limited and local\r\ntransactions which, with the interest on the public stock in the bank,\r\nmight yield a dividend sufficient for the purpose until a change from\r\nwar to peace should enable it, by a flow of specie into its vaults and\r\na removal of the external demand for it, to derive its contemplated\r\nemoluments from a safe and full extension of its operations.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, when it is considered that the proposed establishment\r\nwill enjoy a monopoly of the profits of a national bank for a period of\r\ntwenty years; that the monopolized profits will be continually growing\r\nwith the progress of the national population and wealth; that the nation\r\nwill during the same period be dependent on the notes of the bank for\r\nthat species of circulating medium whenever the precious metals may\r\nbe wanted, and at all times for so much thereof as may be an eligible\r\nsubstitute for a specie medium, and that the extensive employment of the\r\nnotes in the collection of the augmented taxes will, moreover, enable\r\nthe bank greatly to extend its profitable issues of them without the\r\nexpense of specie capital to support their circulation, it is as\r\nreasonable as it is requisite that the Government, in return for these\r\nextraordinary concessions to the bank, should have a greater security\r\nfor attaining the public objects of the institution than is presented in\r\nthe bill, and particularly for every practicable accommodation, both in\r\nthe temporary advances necessary to anticipate the taxes and in those\r\nmore durable loans which are equally necessary to diminish the resort\r\nto taxes.\r\n\r\nIn discharging this painful duty of stating objections to a measure\r\nwhich has undergone the deliberations and received the sanction of\r\nthe two Houses of the National Legislature I console myself with the\r\nreflection that if they have not the weight which I attach to them they\r\ncan be constitutionally overruled, and with a confidence that in a\r\ncontrary event the wisdom of Congress will hasten to substitute a more\r\ncommensurate and certain provision for the public exigencies.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nThe two Houses of the National Legislature having by a joint resolution\r\nexpressed their desire that in the present time of public calamity and\r\nwar a day may be recommended to be observed by the people of the United\r\nStates as a day of public humiliation and fasting and of prayer to\r\nAlmighty God for the safety and welfare of these States, His blessing on\r\ntheir arms, and a speedy restoration of peace, I have deemed it proper\r\nby this proclamation to recommend that Thursday, the 12th of January\r\nnext, be set apart as a day on which all may have an opportunity of\r\nvoluntarily offering at the same time in their respective religious\r\nassemblies their humble adoration to the Great Sovereign of the\r\nUniverse, of confessing their sins and transgressions, and of\r\nstrengthening their vows of repentance and amendment. They will be\r\ninvited by the same solemn occasion to call to mind the distinguished\r\nfavors conferred on the American people in the general health which has\r\nbeen enjoyed, in the abundant fruits of the season, in the progress of\r\nthe arts instrumental to their comfort, their prosperity, and their\r\nsecurity, and in the victories which have so powerfully contributed to\r\nthe defense and protection of our country, a devout thankfulness for all\r\nwhich ought to be mingled with their supplications to the Beneficent\r\nParent of the Human Race that He would be graciously pleased to pardon\r\nall their offenses against Him; to support and animate them in the\r\ndischarge of their respective duties; to continue to them the precious\r\nadvantages flowing from political institutions so auspicious to their\r\nsafety against dangers from abroad, to their tranquillity at home, and\r\nto their liberties, civil and religious; and that He would in a special\r\nmanner preside over the nation in its public councils and constituted\r\nauthorities, giving wisdom to its measures and success to its arms\r\nin maintaining its rights and in overcoming all hostile designs and\r\nattempts against it; and, finally, that by inspiring the enemy with\r\ndispositions favorable to a just and reasonable peace its blessings\r\nmay be speedily and happily restored.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nGiven at the city of Washington, the 16th day of November, 1814, and of\r\nthe Independence of the United States the thirty-eighth.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nAmong the many evils produced by the wars which with little intermission\r\nhave afflicted Europe and extended their ravages into other quarters\r\nof the globe for a period exceeding twenty years, the dispersion or a\r\nconsiderable portion of the inhabitants of different countries in sorrow\r\nand in want has not been the least injurious to human happiness nor the\r\nleast severe in the trial of human virtue.\r\n\r\nIt had been long ascertained that many foreigners, flying from the\r\ndangers of their own home, and that some citizens, forgetful of their\r\nduty, had cooperated in forming an establishment on the island of\r\nBarrataria, near the mouth of the river Mississippi, for the purposes\r\nof a clandestine and lawless trade. The Government of the United States\r\ncaused the establishment to be broken up and destroyed, and having\r\nobtained the means of designating the offenders of every description,\r\nit only remained to answer the demands of justice by inflicting an\r\nexemplary punishment.\r\n\r\nBut it has since been represented that the offenders have manifested a\r\nsincere penitence; that they have abandoned the prosecution of the worse\r\ncause for the support of the best, and particularly that they have\r\nexhibited in the defense of New Orleans unequivocal traits of courage\r\nand fidelity. Offenders who have refused to become the associates of the\r\nenemy in the war upon the most seducing terms of invitation and who have\r\naided to repel his hostile invasion of the territory of the United\r\nStates can no longer be considered as objects of punishment, but as\r\nobjects of a generous forgiveness.\r\n\r\nIt has therefore been seen with great satisfaction that the general\r\nassembly of the State of Louisiana earnestly recommend those offenders\r\nto the benefit of a full pardon.\r\n\r\nAnd in compliance with that recommendation, as well as in consideration\r\nof all the other extraordinary circumstances of the case, I, James\r\nMadison, President of the United States of America, do issue this\r\nproclamation, hereby granting, publishing, and declaring a free and full\r\npardon of all offenses committed in violation of any act or acts of the\r\nCongress of the said United States touching the revenue, trade, and\r\nnavigation thereof or touching the intercourse and commerce of the\r\nUnited States with foreign nations at any time before the 8th day of\r\nJanuary, in the present year 1815, by any person or persons whomsoever\r\nbeing inhabitants of New Orleans and the adjacent country or being\r\ninhabitants of the said island of Barrataria and the places adjacent:\r\n_Provided_, That every person claiming the benefit of this full\r\npardon in order to entitle himself thereto shall produce a certificate\r\nin writing from the governor of the State of Louisiana stating that such\r\nperson has aided in the defense of New Orleans and the adjacent country\r\nduring the invasion thereof as aforesaid.\r\n\r\nAnd I do hereby further authorize and direct all suits, indictments,\r\nand prosecutions for fines, penalties, and forfeitures against any\r\nperson or persons who shall be entitled to the benefit of this full\r\npardon forthwith to be stayed, discontinued, and released; and all\r\ncivil officers are hereby required, according to the duties of their\r\nrespective stations, to carry this proclamation into immediate and\r\nfaithful execution.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, the 6th day of February, in the year\r\n1815, and of the Independence of the United States the thirty-ninth.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  JAMES MONROE,\r\n    _Acting as Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From Niles's Weekly Register, vol. 7, p. 397.]\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\n_To all and singular to whom these presents shall come, greeting_:\r\n\r\nWhereas a treaty of peace and amity between the United States of America\r\nand His Britannic Majesty was signed at Ghent on the 24th day of\r\nDecember, 1814, by the plenipotentiaries respectively appointed for that\r\npurpose; and the said treaty having been, by and with the advice and\r\nconsent of the Senate of the United States, duly accepted, ratified, and\r\nconfirmed on the 17th day of February, 1815, and ratified copies thereof\r\nhaving been exchanged agreeably to the tenor of the said treaty, which\r\nis in the words following, to wit:\r\n\r\n[Here follows the treaty.]\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, to the end that the said treaty of peace and amity may\r\nbe observed with good faith on the part of the United States, I, James\r\nMadison, President as aforesaid, have caused the premises to be made\r\npublic; and I do hereby enjoin all persons bearing office, civil or\r\nmilitary, within the United States and all others citizens or\r\ninhabitants thereof or being within the same faithfully to observe and\r\nfulfill the said treaty and every clause and article thereof.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have caused the seal of the United States to be\r\naffixed to these presents, and signed the same with my hand.\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this 18th day of February, A.D. 1815,\r\nand of the Sovereignty and Independence of the United States the\r\nthirty-ninth.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  JAMES MONROE,\r\n    _Acting Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nThe Senate and House of Representatives of the United States have by a\r\njoint resolution signified their desire that a day may be recommended to\r\nbe observed by the people of the United States with religious solemnity\r\nas a day of thanksgiving and of devout acknowledgments to Almighty God\r\nfor His great goodness manifested in restoring to them the blessing of\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nNo people ought to feel greater obligations to celebrate the goodness of\r\nthe Great Disposer of Events and of the Destiny of Nations than the\r\npeople of the United States. His kind providence originally conducted\r\nthem to one of the best portions of the dwelling place allotted for the\r\ngreat family of the human race. He protected and cherished them under\r\nall the difficulties and trials to which they were exposed in their\r\nearly days. Under His fostering care their habits, their sentiments, and\r\ntheir pursuits prepared them for a transition in due time to a state of\r\nindependence and self-government. In the arduous struggle by which it\r\nwas attained they were distinguished by multiplied tokens of His benign\r\ninterposition. During the interval which succeeded He reared them into\r\nthe strength and endowed them with the resources which have enabled them\r\nto assert their national rights and to enhance their national character\r\nin another arduous conflict, which is now so happily terminated by a\r\npeace and reconciliation with those who have been our enemies. And to\r\nthe same Divine Author of Every Good and Perfect Gift we are indebted\r\nfor all those privileges and advantages, religious as well as civil,\r\nwhich are so richly enjoyed in this favored land.\r\n\r\nIt is for blessings such as these, and more especially for the\r\nrestoration of the blessing of peace, that I now recommend that the\r\nsecond Thursday in April next be set apart as a day on which the people\r\nof every religious denomination may in their solemn assemblies unite\r\ntheir hearts and their voices in a freewill offering to their Heavenly\r\nBenefactor of their homage of thanksgiving and of their songs of praise.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nGiven at the city of Washington on the 4th day of March, A.D. 1815, and\r\nof the Independence of the United States the thirty-ninth.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas information has been received that sundry persons citizens of\r\nthe United States or residents within the same, and especially within\r\nthe State of Louisiana, are conspiring together to begin and set on\r\nfoot, provide, and prepare the means for a military expedition or\r\nenterprise against the dominions of Spain, with which the United States\r\nare happily at peace; that for this purpose they are collecting arms,\r\nmilitary stores, provisions, vessels, and other means; are deceiving and\r\nseducing honest and well-meaning citizens to engage in their unlawful\r\nenterprises; are organizing, officering, and arming themselves for the\r\nsame contrary to the laws in such cases made and provided:\r\n\r\nI have therefore thought fit to issue this my proclamation, warning and\r\nenjoining all faithful citizens who have been led without due knowledge\r\nor consideration to participate in the said unlawful enterprises to\r\nwithdraw from the same without delay, and commanding all persons\r\nwhatsoever engaged or concerned in the same to cease all further\r\nproceedings therein, as they will answer the contrary at their peril.\r\nAnd I hereby enjoin and require all officers, civil and military, of the\r\nUnited States or of any of the States or Territories, all judges,\r\njustices, and other officers of the peace, all military officers of the\r\nArmy or Navy of the United States, and officers of the militia, to be\r\nvigilant, each within his respective department and according to his\r\nfunctions, in searching out and bringing to punishment all persons\r\nengaged or concerned in such enterprises, in seizing and detaining,\r\nsubject to the disposition of the law, all arms, military stores,\r\nvessels, or other means provided or providing for the same, and, in\r\ngeneral, in preventing the carrying on such expedition or enterprise by\r\nall the lawful means within their power.

The\r\nsquadron in advance on that service, under Commodore Decatur, lost not a\r\nmoment after its arrival in the Mediterranean in seeking the naval force\r\nof the enemy then cruising in that sea, and succeeded in capturing two\r\nof his ships, one of them the principal ship, commanded by the Algerine\r\nadmiral. The high character of the American commander was brilliantly\r\nsustained on the occasion which brought his own ship into close action\r\nwith that of his adversary, as was the accustomed gallantry of all the\r\nofficers and men actually engaged. Having prepared the way by this\r\ndemonstration of American skill and prowess, he hastened to the port of\r\nAlgiers, where peace was promptly yielded to his victorious force. In\r\nthe terms stipulated the rights and honor of the United States were\r\nparticularly consulted by a perpetual relinquishment on the part of\r\nthe Dey of all pretensions to tribute from them. The impressions which\r\nhave thus been made, strengthened as they will have been by subsequent\r\ntransactions with the Regencies of Tunis and of Tripoli by the\r\nappearance of the larger force which followed under Commodore\r\nBainbridge, the chief in command of the expedition, and by the judicious\r\nprecautionary arrangements left by him in that quarter, afford a\r\nreasonable prospect of future security for the valuable portion of our\r\ncommerce which passes within reach of the Barbary cruisers.\r\n\r\nIt is another source of satisfaction that the treaty of peace with Great\r\nBritain has been succeeded by a convention on the subject of commerce\r\nconcluded by the plenipotentiaries of the two countries. In this result\r\na disposition is manifested on the part of that nation corresponding\r\nwith the disposition of the United States, which it may be hoped will\r\nbe improved into liberal arrangements on other subjects on which the\r\nparties have mutual interests, or which might endanger their future\r\nharmony. Congress will decide on the expediency of promoting such a\r\nsequel by giving effect to the measure of confining the American\r\nnavigation to American seamen--a measure which, at the same time that it\r\nmight have that conciliatory tendency, would have the further advantage\r\nof increasing the independence of our navigation and the resources for\r\nour maritime defense.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with the articles in the treaty of Ghent relating to the\r\nIndians, as well as with a view to the tranquillity of our western and\r\nnorthwestern frontiers, measures were taken to establish an immediate\r\npeace with the several tribes who had been engaged in hostilities\r\nagainst the United States. Such of them as were invited to Detroit\r\nacceded readily to a renewal of the former treaties of friendship.\r\nOf the other tribes who were invited to a station on the Mississippi\r\nthe greater number have also accepted the peace offered to them. The\r\nresidue, consisting of the more distant tribes or parts of tribes,\r\nremain to be brought over by further explanations, or by such other\r\nmeans as may be adapted to the dispositions they may finally disclose.\r\n\r\nThe Indian tribes within and bordering on the southern frontier, whom a\r\ncruel war on their part had compelled us to chastise into peace, have\r\nlatterly shown a restlessness which has called for preparatory measures\r\nfor repressing it, and for protecting the commissioners engaged in\r\ncarrying the terms of the peace into execution.\r\n\r\nThe execution of the act for fixing the military peace establishment has\r\nbeen attended with difficulties which even now can only be overcome by\r\nlegislative aid. The selection of officers, the payment and discharge of\r\nthe troops enlisted for the war, the payment of the retained troops and\r\ntheir reunion from detached and distant stations, the collection and\r\nsecurity of the public property in the Quartermaster, Commissary, and\r\nOrdnance departments, and the constant medical assistance required\r\nin hospitals and garrisons rendered a complete execution of the\r\nact impracticable on the 1st of May, the period more immediately\r\ncontemplated. As soon, however, as circumstances would permit, and as\r\nfar as it has been practicable consistently with the public interests,\r\nthe reduction of the Army has been accomplished; but the appropriations\r\nfor its pay and for other branches of the military service having proved\r\ninadequate, the earliest attention to that subject will be necessary;\r\nand the expediency of continuing upon the peace establishment the staff\r\nofficers who have hitherto been provisionally retained is also\r\nrecommended to the consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nIn the performance of the Executive duty upon this occasion there has\r\nnot been wanting a just sensibility to the merits of the American Army\r\nduring the late war; but the obvious policy and design in fixing an\r\nefficient military peace establishment did not afford an opportunity to\r\ndistinguish the aged and infirm on account of their past services nor\r\nthe wounded and disabled on account of their present sufferings. The\r\nextent of the reduction, indeed, unavoidably involved the exclusion\r\nof many meritorious officers of every rank from the service of their\r\ncountry; and so equal as well as so numerous were the claims to\r\nattention that a decision by the standard of comparative merit could\r\nseldom be attained. Judged, however, in candor by a general standard of\r\npositive merit, the Army Register will, it is believed, do honor to the\r\nestablishment, while the case of those officers whose names are not\r\nincluded in it devolves with the strongest interest upon the legislative\r\nauthority for such provision as shall be deemed the best calculated to\r\ngive support and solace to the veteran and the invalid, to display the\r\nbeneficence as well as the justice of the Government, and to inspire a\r\nmartial zeal for the public service upon every future emergency.\r\n\r\nAlthough the embarrassments arising from the want of an uniform national\r\ncurrency have not been diminished since the adjournment of Congress,\r\ngreat satisfaction has been derived in contemplating the revival of the\r\npublic credit and the efficiency of the public resources. The receipts\r\ninto the Treasury from the various branches of revenue during the nine\r\nmonths ending on the 30th of September last have been estimated at\r\n$12,500,000; the issues of Treasury notes of every denomination during\r\nthe same period amounted to the sum of $14,000,000, and there was also\r\nobtained upon loan during the same period a sum of $9,000,000 of which\r\nthe sum of $6,000,000 was subscribed in cash and the sum of $3,000,000\r\nin Treasury notes. With these means, added to the sum of $1,500,000,\r\nbeing the balance of money in the Treasury on the 1st day of January,\r\nthere has been paid between the 1st of January and the 1st of October on\r\naccount of the appropriations of the preceding and of the present year\r\n(exclusively of the amount of the Treasury notes subscribed to the loan\r\nand of the amount redeemed in the payment of duties and taxes) the\r\naggregate sum of $33,500,000, leaving a balance then in the Treasury\r\nestimated at the sum of $3,000,000. Independent, however, of the\r\narrearages due for military services and supplies, it is presumed that\r\na further sum of $5,000,000, including the interest on the public debt\r\npayable on the 1st of January next, will be demanded at the Treasury\r\nto complete the expenditures of the present year, and for which the\r\nexisting ways and means will sufficiently provide.\r\n\r\nThe national debt, as it was ascertained on the 1st of October last,\r\namounted in the whole to the sum of $120,000,000, consisting of\r\nthe unredeemed balance of the debt contracted before the late war\r\n($39,000,000), the amount of the funded debt contracted in consequence\r\nof the war ($64,000,000), and the amount of the unfunded and floating\r\ndebt, including the various issues of Treasury notes, $17,000,000, which\r\nis in a gradual course of payment. There will probably be some addition\r\nto the public debt upon the liquidation of various claims which are\r\ndepending, and a conciliatory disposition on the part of Congress may\r\nlead honorably and advantageously to an equitable arrangement of the\r\nmilitia expenses incurred by the several States without the previous\r\nsanction or authority of the Government of the United States; but when\r\nit is considered that the new as well as the old portion of the debt\r\nhas been contracted in the assertion of the national rights and\r\nindependence, and when it is recollected that the public expenditures,\r\nnot being exclusively bestowed upon subjects of a transient nature, will\r\nlong be visible in the number and equipments of the American Navy, in\r\nthe military works for the defense of our harbors and our frontiers, and\r\nin the supplies of our arsenals and magazines the amount will bear a\r\ngratifying comparison with the objects which have been attained, as well\r\nas with the resources of the country.\r\n\r\nThe arrangements of the finances with a view to the receipts and\r\nexpenditures of a permanent peace establishment will necessarily enter\r\ninto the deliberations of Congress during the present session. It is\r\ntrue that the improved condition of the public revenue will not only\r\nafford the means of maintaining the faith of the Government with its\r\ncreditors inviolate, and of prosecuting successfully the measures of\r\nthe most liberal policy, but will also justify an immediate alleviation\r\nof the burdens imposed by the necessities of the war. It is, however,\r\nessential to every modification of the finances that the benefits of\r\nan uniform national currency should be restored to the community. The\r\nabsence of the precious metals will, it is believed, be a temporary\r\nevil, but until they can again be rendered the general medium of\r\nexchange it devolves on the wisdom of Congress to provide a substitute\r\nwhich shall equally engage the confidence and accommodate the wants of\r\nthe citizens throughout the Union. If the operation of the State banks\r\ncan not produce this result, the probable operation of a national bank\r\nwill merit consideration; and if neither of these expedients be deemed\r\neffectual it may become necessary to ascertain the terms upon which the\r\nnotes of the Government (no longer required as an instrument of credit)\r\nshall be issued upon motives of general policy as a common medium of\r\ncirculation.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the security for future repose which the United States\r\nought to find in their love of peace and their constant respect for\r\nthe rights of other nations, the character of the times particularly\r\ninculcates the lesson that, whether to prevent or repel danger, we ought\r\nnot to be unprepared for it. This consideration will sufficiently\r\nrecommend to Congress a liberal provision for the immediate extension\r\nand gradual completion of the works of defense, both fixed and floating,\r\non our maritime frontier, and an adequate provision for guarding our\r\ninland frontier against dangers to which certain portions of it may\r\ncontinue to be exposed.\r\n\r\nAs an improvement in our military establishment, it will deserve the\r\nconsideration of Congress whether a corps of invalids might not be so\r\norganized and employed as at once to aid in the support of meritorious\r\nindividuals excluded by age or infirmities from the existing\r\nestablishment, and to procure to the public the benefit of their\r\nstationary services and of their exemplary discipline. I recommend also\r\nan enlargement of the Military Academy already established, and the\r\nestablishment of others in other sections of the Union; and I can not\r\npress too much on the attention of Congress such a classification and\r\norganization of the militia as will most effectually render it the\r\nsafeguard of a free state. If experience has shewn in the recent\r\nsplendid achievements of militia the value of this resource for the\r\npublic defense, it has shewn also the importance of that skill in the\r\nuse of arms and that familiarity with the essential rules of discipline\r\nwhich can not be expected from the regulations now in force. With this\r\nsubject is intimately connected the necessity of accommodating the laws\r\nin every respect to the great object of enabling the political authority\r\nof the Union to employ promptly and effectually the physical power of\r\nthe Union in the cases designated by the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe signal services which have been rendered by our Navy and the\r\ncapacities it has developed for successful cooperation in the national\r\ndefense will give to that portion of the public force its full value in\r\nthe eyes of Congress, at an epoch which calls for the constant vigilance\r\nof all governments. To preserve the ships now in a sound state, to\r\ncomplete those already contemplated, to provide amply the imperishable\r\nmaterials for prompt augmentations, and to improve the existing\r\narrangements into more advantageous establishments for the construction,\r\nthe repairs, and the security of vessels of war is dictated by the\r\nsoundest policy.\r\n\r\nIn adjusting the duties on imports to the object of revenue the\r\ninfluence of the tariff on manufactures will necessarily present itself\r\nfor consideration. However wise the theory may be which leaves to the\r\nsagacity and interest of individuals the application of their industry\r\nand resources, there are in this as in other cases exceptions to the\r\ngeneral rule. Besides the condition which the theory itself implies of\r\na reciprocal adoption by other nations, experience teaches that so many\r\ncircumstances must concur in introducing and maturing manufacturing\r\nestablishments, especially of the more complicated kinds, that a country\r\nmay remain long without them, although sufficiently advanced and in some\r\nrespects even peculiarly fitted for carrying them on with success. Under\r\ncircumstances giving a powerful impulse to manufacturing industry it has\r\nmade among us a progress and exhibited an efficiency which justify the\r\nbelief that with a protection not more than is due to the enterprising\r\ncitizens whose interests are now at stake it will become at an early day\r\nnot only safe against occasional competitions from abroad, but a source\r\nof domestic wealth and even of external commerce. In selecting the\r\nbranches more especially entitled to the public patronage a preference\r\nis obviously claimed by such as will relieve the United States from a\r\ndependence on foreign supplies, ever subject to casual failures, for\r\narticles necessary for the public defense or connected with the primary\r\nwants of individuals. It will be an additional recommendation of\r\nparticular manufactures where the materials for them are extensively\r\ndrawn from our agriculture, and consequently impart and insure to that\r\ngreat fund of national prosperity and independence an encouragement\r\nwhich can not fail to be rewarded.\r\n\r\nAmong the means of advancing the public interest the occasion is\r\na proper one for recalling the attention of Congress to the great\r\nimportance of establishing throughout our country the roads and canals\r\nwhich can best be executed under the national authority. No objects\r\nwithin the circle of political economy so richly repay the expense\r\nbestowed on them; there are none the utility of which is more\r\nuniversally ascertained and acknowledged; none that do more honor to the\r\ngovernments whose wise and enlarged patriotism duly appreciates them.\r\nNor is there any country which presents a field where nature invites\r\nmore the art of man to complete her own work for his accommodation and\r\nbenefit. These considerations are strengthened, moreover, by the\r\npolitical effect of these facilities for intercommunication in bringing\r\nand binding more closely together the various parts of our extended\r\nconfederacy. Whilst the States individually, with a laudable enterprise\r\nand emulation, avail themselves of their local advantages by new\r\nroads, by navigable canals, and by improving the streams susceptible\r\nof navigation, the General Government is the more urged to similar\r\nundertakings, requiring a national jurisdiction and national means, by\r\nthe prospect of thus systematically completing so inestimable a work;\r\nand it is a happy reflection that any defect of constitutional authority\r\nwhich may be encountered can be supplied in a mode which the\r\nConstitution itself has providently pointed out.\r\n\r\nThe present is a favorable season also for bringing again into view the\r\nestablishment of a national seminary of learning within the District of\r\nColumbia, and with means drawn from the property therein, subject to\r\nthe authority of the General Government. Such an institution claims\r\nthe patronage of Congress as a monument of their solicitude for the\r\nadvancement of knowledge, without which the blessings of liberty can\r\nnot be fully enjoyed or long preserved; as a model instructive in the\r\nformation of other seminaries; as a nursery of enlightened preceptors,\r\nand as a central resort of youth and genius from every part of their\r\ncountry, diffusing on their return examples of those national feelings,\r\nthose liberal sentiments, and those congenial manners which contribute\r\ncement to our Union and strength to the great political fabric of which\r\nthat is the foundation.\r\n\r\nIn closing this communication I ought not to repress a sensibility,\r\nin which you will unite, to the happy lot of our country and to the\r\ngoodness of a superintending Providence, to which we are indebted for\r\nit. Whilst other portions of mankind are laboring under the distresses\r\nof war or struggling with adversity in other forms, the United States\r\nare in the tranquil enjoyment of prosperous and honorable peace. In\r\nreviewing the scenes through which it has been attained we can rejoice\r\nin the proofs given that our political institutions, founded in human\r\nrights and framed for their preservation, are equal to the severest\r\ntrials of war, as well as adapted to the ordinary periods of repose. As\r\nfruits of this experience and of the reputation acquired by the American\r\narms on the land and on the water, the nation finds itself possessed of\r\na growing respect abroad and of a just confidence in itself, which are\r\namong the best pledges for its peaceful career. Under other aspects of\r\nour country the strongest features of its flourishing condition are seen\r\nin a population rapidly increasing on a territory as productive as it is\r\nextensive; in a general industry and fertile ingenuity which find their\r\nample rewards, and in an affluent revenue which admits a reduction of\r\nthe public burdens without withdrawing the means of sustaining the\r\npublic credit, of gradually discharging the public debt, of providing\r\nfor the necessary defensive and precautionary establishments, and of\r\npatronizing in every authorized mode undertakings conducive to the\r\naggregate wealth and individual comfort of our citizens.\r\n\r\nIt remains for the guardians of the public welfare to persevere in that\r\njustice and good will toward other nations which invite a return of\r\nthese sentiments toward the United States; to cherish institutions which\r\nguarantee their safety and their liberties, civil and religious; and to\r\ncombine with a liberal system of foreign commerce an improvement of the\r\nnational advantages and a protection and extension of the independent\r\nresources of our highly favored and happy country.\r\n\r\nIn all measures having such objects my faithful cooperation will be\r\nafforded.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 6, 1815_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI lay before the Senate, for their consideration and advice as to a\r\nratification, a treaty of peace with the Dey of Algiers concluded on\r\nthe 30th day of June, 1815, with a letter relating to the same from\r\nthe American commissioners to the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 6, 1815.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI lay before the Senate, for their consideration and advice as to a\r\nratification, a convention to regulate the commerce between the United\r\nStates and Great Britain, signed by their respective plenipotentiaries\r\non the 3d of July last, with letters relating to the same from the\r\nAmerican plenipotentiaries to the Secretary of State, and also the\r\ndeclaration with which it is the intention of the British Government\r\nto accompany the exchange of the ratification of the convention.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 6, 1815_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI lay before the Senate, for their consideration and advice as to a\r\nratification, treaties which have been concluded with the following\r\nIndian tribes, viz: Iaway tribe, Kickapoo tribe, Poutawatamie, Siouxs\r\nof the Lakes, Piankeshaw tribe, Siouxs of the River St. Peters, Great\r\nand Little Osage tribes, Yancton tribe, Mahas, Fox tribe, Teeton, Sac\r\nNation, Kanzas tribe, Chippewa, Ottawa, Potawatamie, Shawanoe, Wyandot,\r\nMiami, Delaware, and Seneca.\r\n\r\nI communicate also the letters from the commissioners on the part of\r\nthe United States relating to their proceedings on those occasions.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 11, 1815_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit the original of the convention between the United States and\r\nGreat Britain, as signed by their respective plenipotentiaries, on the\r\n3d day of July last, a copy of which was laid before the Senate on the\r\n5th instant.\r\n\r\nI transmit also a copy of the late treaty of peace with Algiers, as\r\ncertified by one of the commissioners of the United States, an office\r\ncopy of which was laid before the Senate on the 5th instant, the\r\noriginal of the treaty not having been received.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 23, 1815.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI lay before Congress copies of a proclamation notifying the convention\r\nconcluded with Great Britain on the 3d day of July last, and that the\r\nsame has been duly ratified; and I recommend to Congress such\r\nlegislative provisions as the convention may call for on the part of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 18, 1816.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe accompanying extract from the occurrences at Fort Jackson in August,\r\n1814, during the negotiation of a treaty with the Indians shows that the\r\nfriendly Creeks, wishing to give to General Jackson, Benjamin Hawkins,\r\nand others a national mark of their gratitude and regard, conveyed to\r\nthem, respectively, a donation of land, with a request that the grant\r\nmight be duly confirmed by the Government of the United States.\r\n\r\nTaking into consideration the peculiar circumstances of the case, the\r\nexpediency of indulging the Indians in wishes which they associated with\r\nthe treaty signed by them, and that the case involves an inviting\r\nopportunity for bestowing on an officer who has rendered such\r\nillustrious services to his country a token of its sensibility to them,\r\nthe inducement to which can not be diminished by the delicacy and\r\ndisinterestedness of his proposal to transfer the benefit from himself,\r\nI recommend to Congress that provision be made for carrying into effect\r\nthe wishes and request of the Indians as expressed by them.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 6, 1816.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIt is represented that the lands in the Michigan Territory designated by\r\nlaw toward satisfying land bounties promised the soldiers of the late\r\narmy are so covered with swamps and lakes, or otherwise unfit for\r\ncultivation, that a very inconsiderable proportion can be applied to the\r\nintended grants. I recommend, therefore, that other lands be designated\r\nby Congress for the purpose of supplying the deficiency.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 5, 1816.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 2d instant, they\r\nare informed that great losses having been sustained by citizens of\r\nthe United States from unjust seizures and confiscations of their\r\nproperty by the late Government of Naples, it was deemed expedient\r\nthat indemnification should be claimed by a special mission for that\r\npurpose. The occasion may be proper, also, for securing the use and\r\naccommodations of the Neapolitan ports, which may at any time be needed\r\nby the public ships of the United States, and for obtaining relief for\r\nthe American commerce from the disadvantageous and unequal regulations\r\nnow operating against it in that Kingdom,\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 9, 1816.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI lay before Congress a statement of the militia of the United States\r\naccording to the latest returns received by the Department of War.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL 11, 1816.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nWith a view to the more convenient arrangement of the important and\r\ngrowing business connected with the grant of exclusive rights to\r\ninventors and authors, I recommend the establishment of a distinct\r\noffice within the Department of State to be charged therewith, under a\r\ndirector with a salary adequate to his services, and with the privilege\r\nof franking communications by mail from and to the office. I recommend\r\nalso that further restraints be imposed on the issue of patents to\r\nwrongful claimants, and further guards provided against fraudulent\r\nexactions of fees by persons possessed of patents.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL 16, 1816.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI lay before Congress copies of a convention concluded between the\r\nUnited States and the Cherokee Indians on the 2d day of March last, as\r\nthe same has been duly ratified and proclaimed; and I recommend that\r\nsuch provision be made by Congress as the stipulations therein contained\r\nmay require,\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL 17, 1816.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIt being presumed that further information may have changed the views\r\nof the Senate relative to the importance and expediency of a mission to\r\nNaples for the purpose of negotiating indemnities to our citizens for\r\nspoliations committed by the Neapolitan Government, I nominate William\r\nPinkney, envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to Russia,\r\nto be minister plenipotentiary to Naples, specially charged with that\r\ntrust.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas it has been represented that many uninformed or evil-disposed\r\npersons have taken possession of or made a settlement on the public\r\nlands of the United States which have not been previously sold, ceded,\r\nor leased by the United States, or the claim to which lands by such\r\npersons has not been previously recognized or confirmed by the United\r\nStates, which possession or settlement is by the act of Congress passed\r\non the 3d day of March, 1807, expressly prohibited; and\r\n\r\nWhereas the due execution of the said act of Congress, as well as the\r\ngeneral interest, requires that such illegal practices should be\r\npromptly repressed:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, James Madison, President of the United States,\r\nhave thought proper to issue my proclamation commanding and strictly\r\nenjoining all persons who have unlawfully taken possession of or made\r\nany settlement on the public lands as aforesaid forthwith to remove\r\ntherefrom; and I do hereby further command and enjoin the marshal,\r\nor officer acting as marshal, in any State or Territory where such\r\npossession shall have been taken or settlement made to remove, from\r\nand after the 10th day of March, 1816, all or any of the said unlawful\r\noccupants; and to effect the said service I do hereby authorize the\r\nemployment of such military force as may become necessary in pursuance\r\nof the provisions of the act of Congress aforesaid, warning the\r\noffenders, moreover, that they will be prosecuted in all such other ways\r\nas the law directs.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have caused the seal of the United States of\r\nAmerica to be affixed to these presents, and signed the same with my\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, the 12th day of December, A.D. 1815, and\r\nof the Independence of the said United States of America the fortieth.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  JAMES MONROE,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From Niles's Weekly Register, vol. 10, p. 208.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas by the act entitled \"An act granting bounties in land and extra\r\npay to certain Canadian volunteers,\" passed the 5th March, 1816, it was\r\nenacted that the locations of the land warrants of the said volunteers\r\nshould \"be subject to such regulations as to priority of choice and\r\nmanner of location as the President of the United States shall direct:\"\r\n\r\nWherefore I, James Madison, President of the United States, in\r\nconformity with the provisions of the act before recited, do hereby make\r\nknown that the land warrants of the said Canadian volunteers may be\r\nlocated agreeably to the said act at the land offices at Vincennes or\r\nJeffersonville, in the Indiana Territory, on the first Monday in June\r\nnext, with the registers of the said land offices; that the warrantees\r\nmay, in person or by their attorneys or other legal representatives, in\r\nthe presence of the register and receiver of the said land district,\r\ndraw lots for the priority of location; and that should any of the\r\nwarrants not appear for location on that day they may be located\r\nafterwards, according to their priority of presentation, the locations\r\nin the district of Vincennes to be made at Vincennes and the locations\r\nin the district of Jeffersonville to be made at Jeffersonville.\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand the 1st day of May, 1816.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  JOSIAH MEIGS,\r\n    _Commissioner of the General Land Office_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEIGHTH ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 3, 1816.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the present state of our country, our attention can not be\r\nwithheld from the effect produced by peculiar seasons which have very\r\ngenerally impaired the annual gifts of the earth and threatened scarcity\r\nin particular districts. Such, however, is the variety of soils, of\r\nclimates, and of products within our extensive limits that the aggregate\r\nresources for subsistence are more than sufficient for the aggregate\r\nwants. And as far as an economy of consumption, more than usual, may be\r\nnecessary, our thankfulness is due to Providence for what is far more\r\nthan a compensation, in the remarkable health which has distinguished\r\nthe present year.\r\n\r\nAmidst the advantages which have succeeded the peace of Europe, and that\r\nof the United States with Great Britain, in a general invigoration of\r\nindustry among us and in the extension of our commerce, the value of\r\nwhich is more and more disclosing itself to commercial nations, it is\r\nto be regretted that a depression is experienced by particular branches\r\nof our manufactures and by a portion of our navigation. As the first\r\nproceeds in an essential degree from an excess of imported merchandise,\r\nwhich carries a check in its own tendency, the cause in its present\r\nextent can not be of very long duration. The evil will not, however,\r\nbe viewed by Congress without a recollection that manufacturing\r\nestablishments, if suffered to sink too low or languish too long,\r\nmay not revive after the causes shall have ceased, and that in the\r\nvicissitudes of human affairs situations may recur in which a dependence\r\non foreign sources for indispensable supplies may be among the most\r\nserious embarrassments.\r\n\r\nThe depressed state of our navigation is to be ascribed in a material\r\ndegree to its exclusion from the colonial ports of the nation most\r\nextensively connected with us in commerce, and from the indirect\r\noperation of that exclusion.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the late convention at London between the United States\r\nand Great Britain the relative state of the navigation laws of the two\r\ncountries, growing out of the treaty of 1794, had given to the British\r\nnavigation a material advantage over the American in the intercourse\r\nbetween the American ports and British ports in Europe. The convention\r\nof London equalized the laws of the two countries relating to those\r\nports, leaving the intercourse between our ports and the ports of the\r\nBritish colonies subject, as before, to the respective regulations of\r\nthe parties. The British Government enforcing now regulations which\r\nprohibit a trade between its colonies and the United States in American\r\nvessels, whilst they permit a trade in British vessels, the American\r\nnavigation loses accordingly, and the loss is augmented by the advantage\r\nwhich is given to the British competition over the American in the\r\nnavigation between our ports and British ports in Europe by the\r\ncircuitous voyages enjoyed by the one and not enjoyed by the other.\r\n\r\nThe reasonableness of the rule of reciprocity applied to one branch of\r\nthe commercial intercourse has been pressed on our part as equally\r\napplicable to both branches; but it is ascertained that the British\r\ncabinet declines all negotiation on the subject, with a disavowal,\r\nhowever, of any disposition to view in an unfriendly light whatever\r\ncountervailing regulations the United States may oppose to the\r\nregulations of which they complain. The wisdom of the Legislature will\r\ndecide on the course which, under these circumstances, is prescribed by\r\na joint regard to the amicable relations between the two nations and to\r\nthe just interests of the United States.\r\n\r\nI have the satisfaction to state, generally, that we remain in amity with\r\nforeign powers.\r\n\r\nAn occurrence has indeed taken place in the Gulf of Mexico which, if\r\nsanctioned by the Spanish Government, may make an exception as to that\r\npower. According to the report of our naval commander on that station,\r\none of our public armed vessels was attacked by an overpowering force\r\nunder a Spanish commander, and the American flag, with the officers and\r\ncrew, insulted in a manner calling for prompt reparation. This has been\r\ndemanded. In the meantime a frigate and a smaller vessel of war have\r\nbeen ordered into that Gulf for the protection of our commerce. It would\r\nbe improper to omit that the representative of His Catholic Majesty in\r\nthe United States lost no time in giving the strongest assurances that\r\nno hostile order could have emanated from his Government, and that it\r\nwill be as ready to do as to expect whatever the nature of the case and\r\nthe friendly relations of the two countries shall be found to require.\r\n\r\nThe posture of our affairs with Algiers at the present moment is not\r\nknown. The Dey, drawing pretexts from circumstances for which the United\r\nStates were not answerable, addressed a letter to this Government\r\ndeclaring the treaty last concluded with him to have been annulled by\r\nour violation of it, and presenting as the alternative war or a renewal\r\nof the former treaty, which stipulated, among other things, an annual\r\ntribute. The answer, with an explicit declaration that the United States\r\npreferred war to tribute, required his recognition and observance of\r\nthe treaty last made, which abolishes tribute and the slavery of our\r\ncaptured citizens. The result of the answer has not been received.\r\nShould he renew his warfare on our commerce, we rely on the protection\r\nit will find in our naval force actually in the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nWith the other Barbary States our affairs have undergone no change.\r\n\r\nThe Indian tribes within our limits appear also disposed to remain\r\nat peace. From several of them purchases of lands have been made\r\nparticularly favorable to the wishes and security of our frontier\r\nsettlements, as well as to the general interests of the nation. In some\r\ninstances the titles, though not supported by due proof, and clashing\r\nthose of one tribe with the claims of another, have been extinguished by\r\ndouble purchases, the benevolent policy of the United States preferring\r\nthe augmented expense to the hazard of doing injustice or to the\r\nenforcement of justice against a feeble and untutored people by means\r\ninvolving or threatening an effusion of blood. I am happy to add that\r\nthe tranquillity which has been restored among the tribes themselves, as\r\nwell as between them and our own population, will favor the resumption\r\nof the work of civilization which had made an encouraging progress among\r\nsome tribes, and that the facility is increasing for extending that\r\ndivided and individual ownership, which exists now in movable property\r\nonly, to the soil itself, and of thus establishing in the culture and\r\nimprovement of it the true foundation for a transit from the habits of\r\nthe savage to the arts and comforts of social life.\r\n\r\nAs a subject of the highest importance to the national welfare, I\r\nmust again earnestly recommend to the consideration of Congress a\r\nreorganization of the militia on a plan which will form it into classes\r\naccording to the periods of life more or less adapted to military\r\nservices. An efficient militia is authorized and contemplated by the\r\nConstitution and required by the spirit and safety of free government.\r\nThe present organization of our militia is universally regarded as less\r\nefficient than it ought to be made, and no organization can be better\r\ncalculated to give to it its due force than a classification which will\r\nassign the foremost place in the defense of the country to that portion\r\nof its citizens whose activity and animation best enable them to rally\r\nto its standard. Besides the consideration that a time of peace is the\r\ntime when the change can be made with most convenience and equity, it\r\nwill now be aided by the experience of a recent war in which the militia\r\nbore so interesting a part.\r\n\r\nCongress will call to mind that no adequate provision has yet been made\r\nfor the uniformity of weights and measures also contemplated by the\r\nConstitution. The great utility of a standard fixed in its nature and\r\nfounded on the easy rule of decimal proportions is sufficiently obvious.\r\nIt led the Government at an early stage to preparatory steps for\r\nintroducing it, and a completion of the work will be a just title to\r\nthe public gratitude.\r\n\r\nThe importance which I have attached to the establishment of a\r\nuniversity within this District on a scale and for objects worthy of\r\nthe American nation induces me to renew my recommendation of it to the\r\nfavorable consideration of Congress. And I particularly invite again\r\ntheir attention to the expediency of exercising their existing powers,\r\nand, where necessary, of resorting to the prescribed mode of enlarging\r\nthem, in order to effectuate a comprehensive system of roads and canals,\r\nsuch as will have the effect of drawing more closely together every\r\npart of our country by promoting intercourse and improvements and by\r\nincreasing the share of every part in the common stock of national\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nOccurrences having taken place which shew that the statutory provisions\r\nfor the dispensation of criminal justice are deficient in relation both\r\nto places and to persons under the exclusive cognizance of the national\r\nauthority, an amendment of the law embracing such cases will merit the\r\nearliest attention of the Legislature. It will be a seasonable occasion\r\nalso for inquiring how far legislative interposition maybe further\r\nrequisite in providing penalties for offenses designated in the\r\nConstitution or in the statutes, and to which either no penalties are\r\nannexed or none with sufficient certainty. And I submit to the wisdom\r\nof Congress whether a more enlarged revisal of the criminal code be not\r\nexpedient for the purpose of mitigating in certain cases penalties which\r\nwere adopted into it antecedent to experiment and examples which justify\r\nand recommend a more lenient policy.\r\n\r\nThe United States, having been the first to abolish within the extent\r\nof their authority the transportation of the natives of Africa into\r\nslavery, by prohibiting the introduction of slaves and by punishing\r\ntheir citizens participating in the traffic, can not but be gratified\r\nat the progress made by concurrent efforts of other nations toward a\r\ngeneral suppression of so great an evil. They must feel at the same\r\ntime the greater solicitude to give the fullest efficacy to their own\r\nregulations. With that view, the interposition of Congress appears to\r\nbe required by the violations and evasions which it is suggested are\r\nchargeable on unworthy citizens who mingle in the slave trade under\r\nforeign flags and with foreign ports, and by collusive importations of\r\nslaves into the United States through adjoining ports and territories.\r\nI present the subject to Congress with a full assurance of their\r\ndisposition to apply all the remedy which can be afforded by an\r\namendment of the law. The regulations which were intended to guard\r\nagainst abuses of a kindred character in the trade between the several\r\nStates ought also to be rendered more effectual for their humane object.\r\n\r\nTo these recommendations I add, for the consideration of Congress, the\r\nexpediency of a remodification of the judiciary establishment, and of\r\nan additional department in the executive branch of the Government.\r\n\r\nThe first is called for by the accruing business which necessarily\r\nswells the duties of the Federal courts, and by the great and widening\r\nspace within which justice is to be dispensed by them. The time seems to\r\nhave arrived which claims for members of the Supreme Court a relief from\r\nitinerary fatigues, incompatible as well with the age which a portion of\r\nthem will always have attained as with the researches and preparations\r\nwhich are due to their stations and to the juridical reputation of their\r\ncountry. And considerations equally cogent require a more convenient\r\norganization of the subordinate tribunals, which may be accomplished\r\nwithout an objectionable increase of the number or expense of the\r\njudges.\r\n\r\nThe extent and variety of executive business also accumulating with\r\nthe progress of our country and its growing population call for an\r\nadditional department, to be charged with duties now overburdening other\r\ndepartments and with such as have not been annexed to any department.\r\n\r\nThe course of experience recommends, as another improvement in the\r\nexecutive establishment, that the provision for the station of\r\nAttorney-General, whose residence at the seat of Government, official\r\nconnections with it, and the management of the public business before\r\nthe judiciary preclude an extensive participation in professional\r\nemoluments, be made more adequate to his services and his\r\nrelinquishments, and that, with a view to his reasonable accommodation\r\nand to a proper depository of his official opinions and proceedings,\r\nthere be included in the provision the usual appurtenances to a public\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nIn directing the legislative attention to the state of the finances it\r\nis a subject of great gratification to find that even within the short\r\nperiod which has elapsed since the return of peace the revenue has far\r\nexceeded all the current demands upon the Treasury, and that under any\r\nprobable diminution of its future annual products which the vicissitudes\r\nof commerce may occasion it will afford an ample fund for the effectual\r\nand early extinguishment of the public debt. It has been estimated that\r\nduring the year 1816 the actual receipts of revenue at the Treasury,\r\nincluding the balance at the commencement of the year, and excluding\r\nthe proceeds of loans and Treasury notes, will amount to about the sum\r\nof $47,000,000; that during the same year the actual payments at the\r\nTreasury, including the payment of the arrearages of the War Department\r\nas well as the payment of a considerable excess beyond the annual\r\nappropriations, will amount to about the sum of $38,000,000, and that\r\nconsequently at the close of the year there will be a surplus in the\r\nTreasury of about the sum of $9,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the Treasury continued to be obstructed by\r\ndifficulties arising from the condition of the national currency, but\r\nthey have nevertheless been effectual to a beneficial extent in the\r\nreduction of the public debt and the establishment of the public credit.\r\nThe floating debt of Treasury notes and temporary loans will soon be\r\nentirely discharged. The aggregate of the funded debt, composed of\r\ndebts incurred during the wars of 1776 and 1812, has been estimated\r\nwith reference to the 1st of January next at a sum not exceeding\r\n$110,000,000. The ordinary annual expenses of the Government for the\r\nmaintenance of all its institutions, civil, military, and naval, have\r\nbeen estimated at a sum less than $20,000,000, and the permanent revenue\r\nto be derived from all the existing sources has been estimated at a sum\r\nof about $25,000,000,\r\n\r\nUpon this general view of the subject it is obvious that there is only\r\nwanting to the fiscal prosperity of the Government the restoration of an\r\nuniform medium of exchange. The resources and the faith of the nation,\r\ndisplayed in the system which Congress has established, insure respect\r\nand confidence both at home and abroad. The local accumulations of the\r\nrevenue have already enabled the Treasury to meet the public engagements\r\nin the local currency of most of the States, and it is expected that the\r\nsame cause will produce the same effect throughout the Union; but for\r\nthe interests of the community at large, as well as for the purposes\r\nof the Treasury, it is essential that the nation should possess a\r\ncurrency of equal value, credit, and use wherever it may circulate.\r\nThe Constitution has intrusted Congress exclusively with the power of\r\ncreating and regulating a currency of that description, and the measures\r\nwhich were taken during the last session in execution of the power\r\ngive every promise of success. The Bank of the United States has been\r\norganized under auspices the most favorable, and can not fail to be an\r\nimportant auxiliary to those measures.\r\n\r\nFor a more enlarged view of the public finances, with a view of the\r\nmeasures pursued by the Treasury Department previous to the resignation\r\nof the late Secretary, I transmit an extract from the last report of\r\nthat officer. Congress will perceive in it ample proofs of the solid\r\nfoundation on which the financial prosperity of the nation rests, and\r\nwill do justice to the distinguished ability and successful exertions\r\nwith which the duties of the Department were executed during a period\r\nremarkable for its difficulties and its peculiar perplexities.\r\n\r\nThe period of my retiring from the public service being at little\r\ndistance, I shall find no occasion more proper than the present for\r\nexpressing to my fellow-citizens my deep sense of the continued\r\nconfidence and kind support which I have received from them. My grateful\r\nrecollection of these distinguished marks of their favorable regard can\r\nnever cease, and with the consciousness that, if I have not served my\r\ncountry with greater ability, I have served it with a sincere devotion\r\nwill accompany me as a source of unfailing gratification.\r\n\r\nHappily, I shall carry with me from the public theater other sources,\r\nwhich those who love their country most will best appreciate. I shall\r\nbehold it blessed with tranquillity and prosperity at home and with\r\npeace and respect abroad. I can indulge the proud reflection that the\r\nAmerican people have reached in safety and success their fortieth year\r\nas an independent nation; that for nearly an entire generation they have\r\nhad experience of their present Constitution, the offspring of their\r\nundisturbed deliberations and of their free choice; that they have found\r\nit to bear the trials of adverse as well as prosperous circumstances:\r\nto contain in its combination of the federate and elective principles\r\na reconcilement of public strength with individual liberty, of national\r\npower for the defense of national rights with a security against wars of\r\ninjustice, of ambition, and of vainglory in the fundamental provision\r\nwhich subjects all questions of war to the will of the nation itself,\r\nwhich is to pay its costs and feel its calamities. Nor is it less a\r\npeculiar felicity of this Constitution, so dear to us all, that it is\r\nfound to be capable, without losing its vital energies, of expanding\r\nitself over a spacious territory with the increase and expansion of the\r\ncommunity for whose benefit it was established.\r\n\r\nAnd may I not be allowed to add to this gratifying spectacle that I\r\nshall read in the character of the American people, in their devotion\r\nto true liberty and to the Constitution which is its palladium, sure\r\npresages that the destined career of my country will exhibit a\r\nGovernment pursuing the public good as its sole object, and regulating\r\nits means by the great principles consecrated in its charter and by\r\nthose moral principles to which they are so well allied; a Government\r\nwhich watches over the purity of elections, the freedom of speech and\r\nof the press, the trial by jury, and the equal interdict against\r\nencroachments and compacts between religion and the state; which\r\nmaintains inviolably the maxims of public faith, the security of persons\r\nand property, and encourages in every authorized mode that general\r\ndiffusion of knowledge which guarantees to public liberty its permanency\r\nand to those who possess the blessing the true enjoyment of it; a\r\nGovernment which avoids intrusions on the internal repose of other\r\nnations, and repels them from its own; which does justice to all nations\r\nwith a readiness equal to the firmness with which it requires justice\r\nfrom them; and which, whilst it refines its domestic code from every\r\ningredient not congenial with the precepts of an enlightened age and the\r\nsentiments of a virtuous people, seeks by appeals to reason and by its\r\nliberal examples to infuse into the law which governs the civilized\r\nworld a spirit which may diminish the frequency or circumscribe the\r\ncalamities of war, and meliorate the social and beneficent relations of\r\npeace; a Government, in a word, whose conduct within and without may\r\nbespeak the most noble of all ambitions---that of promoting peace on\r\nearth and good will to man.\r\n\r\nThese contemplations, sweetening the remnant of my days, will animate my\r\nprayers for the happiness of my beloved country, and a perpetuity of the\r\ninstitutions under which it is enjoyed.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 6, 1816.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe ninth section of the act passed at the last session of Congress \"to\r\nauthorize the payment for property lost, captured, or destroyed by the\r\nenemy while in the military service of the United States, and for other\r\npurposes,\" having received a construction giving to it a scope of great\r\nand uncertain extent, I thought it proper that proceedings relative to\r\nclaims under that part of the act should be suspended until Congress\r\nshould have an opportunity of defining more precisely the cases\r\ncontemplated by them. With that view I now recommend the subject to\r\ntheir consideration. They will have an opportunity at the same time of\r\nconsidering how far other provisions of the act may be rendered more\r\nclear and precise in their import.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 10, 1816.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI lay before the Senate, for their consideration and advice as to\r\na ratification, treaties concluded with the several Indian tribes\r\naccording to the following statement:\r\n\r\nA LIST OF INDIAN TRIBES WITH WHOM TREATIES HAVE BEEN MADE SINCE THE LAST\r\nSESSION OF CONGRESS.\r\n\r\n_Weas and Kickapoos tribes of Indians_.--Treaty concluded at Fort\r\nHarrison between Benjamin Parke and the chiefs and headmen of those\r\ntribes the 4th June, 1816.\r\n\r\n_Ottawas, Chippewas, and Pottowotomees_.--Treaty concluded at St. Louis\r\nbetween Governors Clarke, Edwards, and Colonel Choteau and the chiefs\r\nand headmen of those tribes on the 24th August, 1816.\r\n\r\n_Winnebago tribes_.--Made by the same persons on part United States\r\nand the headmen of this tribe at St. Louis 3d June, 1816.\r\n\r\n_Sacks of Rock River_.--Made by same at St. Louis 13th May, 1816.\r\n\r\n_Siouxs composing three tribes, the Siouxs of the Leaf, the Siouxs of\r\nthe Broad Leaf, and the Siouxs who Shoot on the Pine-tops_.--Made and\r\nconcluded by the same at St. Louis 1st June, 1816.\r\n\r\n_Chickasaw tribe_.--Treaty made by General Jackson, David Merrewether,\r\nesq., and Jesse Franklin, esq., and the headmen of that nation at\r\nChickasaw council house 20th September, 1816.\r\n\r\n_Cherokee tribe_.--Treaty made by General Jackson, David Merrewether,\r\nesq., and Jesse Franklin, esq., and the headmen of that nation at Turkey\r\nTown on the 4th October, 1816.\r\n\r\n_Choctaw tribe_.--Treaty made by General John Coffee, John Rhea, and\r\nJohn McKee, esquires, and the headmen and warriors of that nation at\r\nthe Choctaw trading house on the 24th of October, 1816.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 13, 1816.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nA treaty of commerce between the United States and the King of Sweden\r\nand Norway having been concluded and signed on the 4th day of September\r\nlast by their plenipotentiaries, I lay the same before the Senate for\r\ntheir consideration and advice as to a ratification.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 21, 1816.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of\r\nthe 6th instant, I transmit to them the proceedings of the commissioner\r\nappointed under the act \"to authorize the payment for property lost,\r\ncaptured, or destroyed by the enemy while in the military service of the\r\nUnited States, and for other purposes,\" as reported by the commissioner\r\nto the Department of War.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 26, 1816.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIt is found that the existing laws have not the efficacy necessary to\r\nprevent violations of the obligations of the United States as a nation\r\nat peace toward belligerent parties and other unlawful acts on the high\r\nseas by armed vessels equipped within the waters of the United States.\r\n\r\nWith a view to maintain more effectually the respect due to the laws, to\r\nthe character, and to the neutral and pacific relations of the United\r\nStates, I recommend to the consideration of Congress the expediency of\r\nsuch further legislative provisions as may be requisite for detaining\r\nvessels actually equipped, or in a course of equipment, with a warlike\r\nforce within the jurisdiction of the United States, or, as the case may\r\nbe, for obtaining from the owners or commanders of such vessels adequate\r\nsecurities against the abuse of their armaments, with the exceptions in\r\nsuch provisions proper for the cases of merchant vessels furnished with\r\nthe defensive armaments usual on distant and dangerous expeditions, and\r\nof a private commerce in military stores permitted by our laws, and\r\nwhich the law of nations does not require the United States to prohibit.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 25, 1817.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI lay before Congress copies of ratified treaties between the United\r\nStates and the following Indian tribes:\r\n\r\nFirst. The Wea and Kickapoo.\r\n\r\nSecond. The united tribes of Ottawas, Chippawas, and Potowotomies\r\nresiding on the Illinois and Melwakee rivers and their waters and\r\non the southwestern parts of Lake Michigan.\r\n\r\nThird. That portion of the Winnebago tribe or nation residing on the\r\nOuisconsin River,\r\n\r\nFourth. The Sacs of Rock River and the adjacent country.\r\n\r\nFifth. Eight bands of the Siouxs, composing the three tribes called the\r\nSiouxs of the Leaf, the Siouxs of the Broad Leaf, and the Siouxs who\r\nShoot in the Pine Tops.\r\n\r\nSixth. The Chickasaw tribe of Indians.\r\n\r\nSeventh. The Cherokee tribe of Indians.\r\n\r\nEighth. The Chactaw tribe of Indians.\r\n\r\nCongress will take into consideration how far legislative provisions may\r\nbe necessary for carrying into effect stipulations contained in the said\r\ntreaties,\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 31, 1817.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of His Most\r\nChristian Majesty having renewed, under special instructions from his\r\nGovernment, the claim of the representative of Baron de Beaumarchais for\r\n1,000,000 livres, which were debited to him in the settlement of his\r\naccounts with the United States, I lay before Congress copies of the\r\nmemoir on that subject addressed by the said envoy to the Secretary of\r\nState.\r\n\r\nConsidering that the sum of which the million of livres in question made\r\na part was a gratuitous grant from the French Government to the United\r\nStates, and the declaration of that Government that that part of the\r\ngrant was put into the hands of M. de Beaumarchais as its agent, not as\r\nthe agent of the United States, and was duly accounted for by him to\r\nthe French Government; considering also the concurring opinions of two\r\nAttorneys-General of the United States that the said debit was not\r\nlegally sustainable in behalf of the United States, I recommend the case\r\nto the favorable attention of the Legislature, whose authority alone can\r\nfinally decide on it.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 3, 1817.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe Government of Great Britain, induced by the posture of the relations\r\nwith the United States which succeeded the conclusion of the recent\r\ncommercial convention, issued an order on the 17th day of August, 1815,\r\ndiscontinuing the discriminating duties payable in British ports on\r\nAmerican vessels and their cargoes. It was not until the 22d of December\r\nfollowing that a corresponding discontinuance of discriminating duties\r\non British vessels and their cargoes in American ports took effect under\r\nthe authority vested in the Executive by the act of March, 1816. During\r\nthe period between those two dates there was consequently a failure\r\nof reciprocity or equality in the existing regulations of the two\r\ncountries. I recommend to the consideration of Congress the expediency\r\nof paying to the British Government the amount of the duties remitted\r\nduring the period in question to citizens of the United States, subject\r\nto a deduction of the amount of whatever discriminating duties may have\r\ncommenced in British ports after the signature of that convention and\r\nbeen collected previous to the 17th of August, 1815.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 6, 1817.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nOn comparing the fourth section of the act of Congress passed March 31,\r\n1814, providing for the indemnification of certain claimants of public\r\nlands in the Mississippi Territory, with the article of agreement and\r\ncession between the United States and State of Georgia, bearing date\r\nApril 30, 1802, it appears that the engagements entered into with the\r\nclaimants interfere with the rights and interests secured to that State.\r\nI recommend to Congress that provision be made by law for payments to\r\nthe State of Georgia equal to the amount of Mississippi stock which\r\nshall be paid into the Treasury until the stipulated sum of $1,250,000\r\nshall be completed.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETO MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 3, 1817.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nHaving considered the bill this day presented to me entitled \"An act\r\nto set apart and pledge certain funds for internal improvements,\"\r\nand which sets apart and pledges funds \"for constructing roads and\r\ncanals, and improving the navigation of water courses, in order to\r\nfacilitate, promote, and give security to internal commerce among\r\nthe several States, and to render more easy and less expensive the\r\nmeans and provisions for the common defense,\" I am constrained by\r\nthe insuperable difficulty I feel in reconciling the bill with the\r\nConstitution of the United States to return it with that objection\r\nto the House of Representatives, in which it originated.\r\n\r\nThe legislative powers vested in Congress are specified and enumerated\r\nin the eighth section of the first article of the Constitution, and it\r\ndoes not appear that the power proposed to be exercised by the bill is\r\namong the enumerated powers, or that it falls by any just interpretation\r\nwithin the power to make laws necessary and proper for carrying into\r\nexecution those or other powers vested by the Constitution in the\r\nGovernment of the United States.\r\n\r\n\"The power to regulate commerce among the several States\" can not\r\ninclude a power to construct roads and canals, and to improve the\r\nnavigation of water courses in order to facilitate, promote, and secure\r\nsuch a commerce without a latitude of construction departing from the\r\nordinary import of the terms strengthened by the known inconveniences\r\nwhich doubtless led to the grant of this remedial power to Congress.\r\n\r\nTo refer the power in question to the clause \"to provide for the common\r\ndefense and general welfare\" would be contrary to the established and\r\nconsistent rules of interpretation, as rendering the special and careful\r\nenumeration of powers which follow the clause nugatory and improper.\r\nSuch a view of the Constitution would have the effect of giving to\r\nCongress a general power of legislation instead of the defined and\r\nlimited one hitherto understood to belong to them, the terms \"common\r\ndefense and general welfare\" embracing every object and act within the\r\npurview of a legislative trust. It would have the effect of subjecting\r\nboth the Constitution and laws of the several States in all cases not\r\nspecifically exempted to be superseded by laws of Congress, it being\r\nexpressly declared \"that the Constitution of the United States and laws\r\nmade in pursuance thereof shall be the supreme law of the land, and\r\nthe judges of every State shall be bound thereby, anything in the\r\nconstitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.\" Such\r\na view of the Constitution, finally, would have the effect of excluding\r\nthe judicial authority of the United States from its participation in\r\nguarding the boundary between the legislative powers of the General and\r\nthe State Governments, inasmuch as questions relating to the general\r\nwelfare, being questions of policy and expediency, are unsusceptible of\r\njudicial cognizance and decision.\r\n\r\nA restriction of the power \"to provide for the common defense and\r\ngeneral welfare\" to cases which are to be provided for by the\r\nexpenditure of money would still leave within the legislative power of\r\nCongress all the great and most important measures of Government, money\r\nbeing the ordinary and necessary means of carrying them into execution.\r\n\r\nIf a general power to construct roads and canals, and to improve the\r\nnavigation of water courses, with the train of powers incident thereto,\r\nbe not possessed by Congress, the assent of the States in the mode\r\nprovided in the bill can not confer the power. The only cases in which\r\nthe consent and cession of particular States can extend the power of\r\nCongress are those specified and provided for in the Constitution.\r\n\r\nI am not unaware of the great importance of roads and canals and the\r\nimproved navigation of water courses, and that a power in the National\r\nLegislature to provide for them might be exercised with signal advantage\r\nto the general prosperity. But seeing that such a power is not expressly\r\ngiven by the Constitution, and believing that it can not be deduced from\r\nany part of it without an inadmissible latitude of construction and a\r\nreliance on insufficient precedents; believing also that the permanent\r\nsuccess of the Constitution depends on a definite partition of powers\r\nbetween the General and the State Governments, and that no adequate\r\nlandmarks would be left by the constructive extension of the powers of\r\nCongress as proposed in the bill, I have no option but to withhold\r\nmy signature from it, and to cherishing the hope that its beneficial\r\nobjects may be attained by a resort for the necessary powers to the same\r\nwisdom and virtue in the nation which established the Constitution in\r\nits actual form and providently marked out in the instrument itself a\r\nsafe and practicable mode of improving it as experience might suggest.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n[From Annals of Congress, Fourteenth Congress, second session, 218.]\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 1, 1817_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senators of the United States, respectively_:\r\n\r\nSIR: Objects interesting to the United States requiring that the Senate\r\nshould be in session on the 4th of March next to receive such\r\ncommunications as may be made to it on the part of the Executive, your\r\nattendance in the Senate Chamber in this city on that day is accordingly\r\nrequested.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.",
