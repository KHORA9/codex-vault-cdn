XVIII.--DECEMBER, 1866.--NO. CX.\r\n\r\nEntered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1866, by TICKNOR\r\nAND FIELDS, in the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the\r\nDistrict of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note: Minor typos corrected and footnotes moved to end of\r\narticle.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOHN PIERPONT.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost men of \"fourscore and upwards,\" like Lear, and who, like Lear, have\r\nbeen \"mightily abused\" in their day, are found, upon diligent inquiry,\r\nto have long outlived themselves, like the Archbishop of Granada; but\r\nhere is a man, or was but the other day, in his eighty-second year, with\r\nthe temper and edge and \"bright blue rippling glitter\" of a Damascus\r\nblade up to the very last; or rather, considering how he was last\r\nemployed, with the temper of that strange tool, found among the ruins of\r\nThebes, with which they used to smooth and polish their huge monoliths\r\nof granite, until they murmured a song of joy, whenever the morning\r\nsunshine fell upon them.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable man--remarkable under many aspects--died at Medford,\r\nMassachusetts, on Monday morning, August 27th; and it is now said of\r\nheart-disease,--that other name for a mysterious and sudden death,\r\nhappen how it may, and when it may. He had been perfectly well the day\r\nbefore, attended church, and called on some of his neighbors; he retired\r\nto rest as usual, and nothing more was heard of him till Monday morning,\r\nwhen he was found asleep in Jesus, prepared, as we humbly trust, to hear\r\nthe greeting of \"Well done, thou good and faithful servant!\" Says a\r\nfriend, in a letter now lying before me, of August 27th: \"On Saturday\r\nafternoon, day before yesterday, your friend and my friend, Rev. John\r\nPierpont, called upon me, and we had a very interesting interview of\r\nabout an hour. I never saw him look better or appear happier. Although\r\neighty-one years of age the 6th of last April, he seemed to have the\r\nelasticity of youth, and he was perfectly erect. I gave him what he\r\nwanted very much,--a copy of his trial before an ecclesiastical council\r\nin this city, several years ago. He gave me his photograph, and, taking\r\nhis gold pen, wrote underneath, in a beautiful hand, 'John Pierpont,\r\naged 81.' He said he was doing some work at Washington, which he hoped\r\nto live long enough to complete.... When I published my last book, I\r\nsent him a copy. He acknowledged the receipt of it in a letter of eight\r\nor ten pages, which is now a treasure to me. His name on the photograph\r\nwas probably the last time he ever wrote it,\"--another treasure, which\r\nmy friend would not now be likely to part with for any consideration.\r\n\r\nMy acquaintance with Mr. Pierpont began in the fall or winter of 1814,\r\njust when the war had assumed such proportions, that men's hearts were\r\nfailing them for fear, and prodigies and portents were of daily\r\noccurrence. New England too--finding herself defenceless and left to the\r\nmercy of our foe--began to think, not of setting up for herself, not of\r\nwithdrawing from the copartnership, without the consent of the whole\r\nsisterhood, but of coming together for conference and proposing to the\r\ngeneral government, not to become neutral after the fashion of Kentucky,\r\nin our late misunderstanding, not of playing the part of umpire between\r\nthe belligerents, like that heroic embodiment of Southern chivalry, nor\r\nof holding the balance of power, but, on being allowed her just\r\nproportion of the public revenues, to undertake for herself, and agree\r\nto give a good account of the enemy, if he should throw himself upon her\r\nbulwarks, whether along the seaboard, or upon her great northern\r\nfrontier.\r\n\r\nHe had just escaped from Newburyport, after writing the \"Portrait,\" a\r\nsevere and truthful picture of the times, which went far to give him a\r\nnational reputation--for the day; and opened a law office at 103 Court\r\nStreet, Boston, where he found nothing to do, and spent much of his time\r\nin cutting his name on little ivory seals, and engraving\r\nciphers--\"J.P.\"--so beautiful in their character, and so graceful, that\r\none I have now before me, an impression taken by him in wax, with a\r\nvermilion bed,--for in all such matters he was very particular,--were\r\nenough to establish any man's reputation as a seal engraver. It bears\r\nabout the same relationship to what are _called_ ciphers, that Benvenuto\r\nCellini's flower-cups bore to the clumsy goblets of his day.\r\n\r\nHe was never a great reader, not being able to read more than fifty\r\npages of law and miscellany in a day, though he managed, for once, while\r\na tutor in Colonel Alston's family at Charleston, South Carolina,\r\nbeginning by daylight and continuing as long as he could see, in\r\nmidsummer, to get through with one hundred pages of Blackstone; but the\r\n\"grind\" was too much for him,--he never tried it again. He read Gibbon,\r\nand Chateaubriand's \"Genius of Christianity,\" and St. Pierre, and Jeremy\r\nBentham's \"Theory of Rewards and Punishments,\" but never to my knowledge\r\na novel, a romance, or a magazine article, except an occasional review;\r\nbut Joanna Baillie,--that female Shakespeare of a later age,--and\r\nBeattie, and Campbell, and the British poets, and dramatic writers, were\r\nalways at hand, when he had nothing better to do, with no seals to cut,\r\nno ciphers, no razor-strops, no stoves, and no clients. Over that field\r\nof enchantment and illusion he wandered with lifted wings, month after\r\nmonth, and year after year.\r\n\r\nAt this time he was in his thirtieth year, and I in my twenty-second. No\r\ntwo persons were ever more unlike; and yet we grew to be intimate\r\nfriends after a while; and at the time of his death our friendship had\r\nlasted more than fifty years, with a single interruption of a\r\ntwelvemonth or so while I was abroad, which was put an end to by our\r\nletters of reconciliation crossing each other almost on the same day.\r\n\r\nWith a young family on his hands, precarious health and a feeble\r\nconstitution, as we then believed, which drove him to Saratoga every two\r\nor three years, and no property, what had he to look forward to, unless\r\nhe could manage to go through a course of starvation at half-price, or\r\ndiet with the chameleons?--though great things were expected of him by\r\nthose who knew him best, and the late Mr. Justice Story could not bear\r\nto think of his abandoning the profession, so long as there was a decent\r\nchance of living through such a course of preparation.\r\n\r\nAfter all that he has done as a poet, as a preacher, as a reformer, and\r\nas a lecturer, I must say that I think he was made for a lawyer.\r\nVigorous and acute, clear-sighted, self-possessed, and logical to a\r\nfault, if he had not married so early, or if a respectable inheritance\r\nhad fallen to him, after he had learned to do without help or patronage,\r\nas Dr. Samuel Johnson did, while undergoing Lord Chesterfield, he might\r\nhave been at the head of the Massachusetts bar,--a proud position, to be\r\nsure, at any time within the last fifty years,--or, at any rate, in the\r\nforemost rank, long before his death.\r\n\r\nHe had, withal, a great fondness for mechanics, and one at least of his\r\ninventions, the \"Pierpont or Doric Stove,\" was a bit of concrete\r\nphilosophy,--a miniature temple glowing with perpetual fire,--a\r\ncast-iron syllogism of itself, so classically just in its proportions,\r\nand so eminently characteristic, as to be a type of the author. He had\r\nbeen led through a long course of experiment in the structure of grates\r\nand stoves, and in the consumption of fuel, with the hope of superseding\r\nSaratoga, for himself at least, by making our terrible winters and our\r\neast winds a little more endurable. No man ever suffered more from what\r\npeople sometimes call, without meaning to be naughty, _damp cold\r\nweather_.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the \"Portrait,\" he had written a New-Year's Address or\r\ntwo, and a fine lyric, which was said or sung--I forget which--at the\r\ncelebration of Napoleon's retreat from Moscow; so that after he went off\r\nto Baltimore, and the \"Airs of Palestine\" appeared in 1816, those who\r\nknew him best, instead of being astonished like the rest of the world,\r\nregarded it as nothing more than the fulfilment of a promise, and went\r\nabout saying, or looking as if they wanted to say, \"Didn't we tell you\r\nso?\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet, with the exception of two or three outbreaks and flashes, there\r\nwas really nothing in his earlier manifestations to prefigure the\r\n\"unrolling glory\" of the \"Airs,\" or to justify the extravagant\r\nexpectations people had entertained from the first, if you would believe\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nRobert Treat Paine having disappeared from the stage, there was nobody\r\nleft but Lucius Manlius Sargent and John Pierpont for celebrations and\r\nsudden emergencies. But Sargent never tried the heroic, and was\r\ngenerally satisfied with imitations of Walter Scott, and others, who\r\nwere given to oddities and quaintness. For example, \"I thought,\" says\r\nhe, in the longest poem he ever wrote, which appeared in quarto,--\r\n\r\n    \"I thought, than as a feather fair\r\n    More light is filmy gossamer,\r\n    So woman's heart is lighter far\r\n    Than lightest breath of summer air,\r\n    Which is so light it scarce can bear\r\n    The filmiest thread of gossamer,\" etc., etc., etc.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Pierpont flung himself abroad--like Handel, over the great\r\norgan-keys at Haarlem--as if he never knew before what legs and arms\r\nwere good for, after the following fashion:--\r\n\r\n    \"The misty hall of Odin\r\n      With mirth and music swells,\r\n    Rings with the harps and songs of bards,\r\n      And echoes to their shells.\r\n\r\n    \"See how amid the cloud-wrapped ghosts\r\n      Great Peter's awful form\r\n        Seems to smile,\r\n        As the while,\r\n      Amid the howling storm,\r\n    He hears his children shout, Hurrah!\r\n      Amid the howling storm,\" etc., etc.\r\n\r\nFew men ever elaborated as he did,--not even Rousseau, when he wrote\r\nover whole pages and chapters of his \"Confessions,\" I forget how many\r\ntimes. Fine thoughts were never spontaneous with him, never unexpected,\r\nnever unwaited for,--never, certainly till long after he had got his\r\ngrowth. In fact, some of the happiest passages we have seem to be\r\nengraved, letter by letter, instead of being written at once, or\r\nlaunched away into the stillness, like a red-hot thunderbolt. Well do I\r\nremember a little incident which occurred in Baltimore, soon after the\r\nfailure of Pierpont and Lord--and Neal, when we were all dying of sheer\r\ninaction, and almost ready to hang ourselves--in a metaphorical\r\nsense--as the shortest way of scoring off with the world.\r\n\r\nWe were at breakfast,--it was rather late.\r\n\r\n\"Where on earth is your good husband?\" said I to Mrs. Pierpont.\r\n\r\n\"In bed, making poetry,\" said she.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, flat on his back, with his eyes rolled up in his head.\"\r\n\r\nSoon after, the gentleman himself appeared, looking somewhat the worse\r\nfor the labor he had gone through with, and all the happier, that the\r\nthroes were over, and the offspring ready for exhibition. \"Here,\" said\r\nhe, \"tell me what you think of these two lines,\"--handing me a paper on\r\nwhich was written, with the clearness and beauty of copperplate,\r\n\r\n    \"Their reverend beards that sweep their bosoms wet\r\n    With the chill dews of shady Olivet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Charming,\" said I. \"And what then? What are you driving at?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I was thinking of Olivet, and then I wanted a rhyme for Olivet;\r\nand rhymes are the rudders, you know, according to Hudibras; and then\r\nuprose the picture of the Apostles before me,--their reverend beards all\r\ndripping with the dews of night.\"\r\n\r\nHow little did he or I then foresee what soon followed,--soon, that is,\r\nin comparison with all he had ever done before! The \"Airs of Palestine,\"\r\nlike the night-blooming cereus,--the century-plant,--flowering at last,\r\nand all at once and most unexpectedly too, after generations have waited\r\nfor it, as for the penumbra of something foretold, until both their\r\npatience and their faith have almost failed. But, from the very first,\r\nthere were signs of growth not to be mistaken,--of inward growth,\r\ntoo,--and oftentimes an appearance of slowly gathered strength, as if it\r\nhad been long husbanded, and for a great purpose. For example,--\r\n\r\n    \"There the gaunt wolf sits on his rock and howls,\r\n    And there, in painted pomp, the savage Indian prowls.\"\r\n\r\nWhat a picture of brooding desolation! How concentrated and how\r\nunpretending, in its simplicity and strength!\r\n\r\nAnd again, having had visions, and having begun to breathe a new\r\natmosphere, with Sinai in view, he says,\r\n\r\n    \"There blasts of unseen trumpets, long and loud,\r\n    Swelled by the breath of whirlwinds, rent the cloud,\"--\r\n\r\ntwo of the grandest lines to be found anywhere, out of the Hebrew.\r\n\r\nBut grandeur and strength were never his characteristics; the natural\r\ntendency of the man was toward the harmonious, the loving, and the\r\nbeautiful, as in the following lines from the title-page of his poem,\r\n\"By J. Pierpont, _Esquire_\":--\r\n\r\n    \"I love to breathe where Gilead sheds her balm;\r\n    I love to walk on Jordan's banks of palm;\r\n    I love to wet my foot in Hermon's dews;\r\n    I love the promptings of Isaiah's muse;\r\n    In Carmel's paly grots I'll court repose,\r\n    And deck my mossy couch with Sharon's deathless rose.\"\r\n\r\nAbout this time it was, just before he went off to Baltimore, that we\r\nbegan to have occasional glimpses of that inward fire shut up in his\r\nbones, that subterranean sunshine, that golden ore, which, smelted as\r\nthe constellations were, makes what men have agreed to call\r\npoetry,--which, after all, is but another name for inspiration; although\r\nthe very first outbreak I remember happened at the celebration already\r\nreferred to, where men saw\r\n\r\n    \"The Desolator desolate, the Victor overthrown,\r\n    The Arbiter of others' fate a suppliant for his own,\"\r\n\r\nand began to breathe freely once more; and the shout of \"Glory, glory!\r\nAlleluiah!\" went up like the roar of many waters from all the cities of\r\nour land, as if they themselves had been delivered from the new\r\nSennacherib; yet, after a short season of rest, like one of our Western\r\nprairies after having been over-swept with fire, he began to flower\r\nanew, and from his innermost nature, like some great aboriginal plant of\r\nour Northern wilderness suddenly transferred to a tropical region, roots\r\nand all, by some convulsion of nature,--by hurricane, or drift, or\r\nshipwreck. And always thereafter, with a very few brief exceptions,\r\ninstead of echoing and re-echoing the musical thunders of a buried\r\npast,--instead of imitating, oftentimes unconsciously (the worst kind of\r\nimitation, by the way, for what can be hoped of a man whose\r\nindividuality has been tampered with, and whose own perceptions mislead\r\nhim?)--instead of counterfeiting the mighty minstrels he had most\r\nreverenced, and oftentimes ignorantly worshipped, as among the unknown\r\ngods, in his unquestioning, breathless homage, he began to look upward\r\nto the Source of all inspiration, while\r\n\r\n    \"Princely visions rare\r\n    Went stepping through the air,\"\r\n\r\nand to walk abroad with all his \"singing robes about him,\" as he had\r\nnever done before. Hitherto it had been otherwise. Campbell had opened\r\nthe \"Pleasures of Hope\" with\r\n\r\n    \"Why to yon mountains turns the musing eye,\r\n    Whose sunbright summits mingle with the sky?\"\r\n\r\nand _therefore_ Pierpont began his \"Portrait\" with\r\n\r\n    \"Why does the eye with greater pleasure rest\r\n    On the proud oak with vernal honors drest?\"\r\n\r\nBut now, instead of diluting Beattie, with all his \"pomp of groves and\r\nlong resounding shore,\" and recasting portions of Akenside or Pope, and\r\nrehashing \"Ye Mariners of England,\" for public celebrations, or\r\nconverting Moore himself into \"Your glass may be purple and mine may be\r\nblue,\" while urging the claims of what is called Liberal Christianity in\r\na hymn written for the new Unitarian church of Baltimore, he\r\nwould break forth now and then with something which really seemed\r\nunpremeditated,--something he had been surprised into saying in spite of\r\nhimself, as where he finishes a picture of Moses on Mount Nebo, after a\r\nfashion both startling and effective in its abruptness, and yet\r\naltogether his own:--\r\n\r\n    \"His sunny mantle and his hoary locks\r\n    Shone like the robe of Winter on the rocks.\r\n    Where is that mantle? Melted into air.\r\n    Where is the Prophet? God can tell thee where.\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet in the day of his strength he was sometimes capable of strange\r\nself-forgetfulness, and once wrote, in his reverence for the classic,\r\nwhat, if it were not blasphemy, would be meaningless:--\r\n\r\n    \"O thou dread Spirit! being's End and Source!\r\n    O check thy chariot in its fervid course;\r\n    _Bend from thy throne of darkness and of fire_,\r\n    _And with one smile immortalize oar lyre!_\"\r\n\r\nThink of a Christian poet apostrophizing the Ancient of Days--Jehovah\r\nhimself--in the language of idolatrous and pagan Rome!\r\n\r\nAt another time,--but these are among the last of his transgressions,\r\nand they happened nearly fifty years before his death,--having in view\r\nthat epitaph on an infant where a father says of his child,\r\n\r\n              \"Like a dewdrop on the early morn\r\n    She sparkled, was exhaled, and went to heaven,\"\r\n\r\nMr. Pierpont says of the frozen heart, when religion's \"mild and genial\r\nray\" falls upon it, with music,\r\n\r\n    \"The fire is kindled and the flame is bright;\r\n    And that cold mass, with either power assailed,\r\n    _Is warmed, made liquid, and to heaven exhaled_.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this by a man who talks about \"the glow-worm burning _greenly_ on\r\nthe wall,\" and the \"_unrolling glory_\" of the empyrean, as if he\r\nunderstood what both meant.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, and notwithstanding these aberrations, my friend--the\r\ntruest friend I ever had in my life, on some accounts, for he was not\r\nafraid to tell me of my faults when he saw them, and the man after all,\r\nto whom I am under greater obligations than to any other, living or\r\ndead, for bringing me acquainted with myself--held on his upward course\r\nfor the last thirty years of his life without faltering, and without any\r\nvisible perturbation, like the planets, if not like the stars, along\r\ntheir appointed path, never so as to astonish perhaps, but almost always\r\nso as to convince, whatever might be the manner of his approach, and\r\nwhether in prose or poetry.\r\n\r\nBut we are anticipating. At the time of our first acquaintance, he\r\ncertainly entertained very different views upon the subjects which have\r\nmade him so conspicuous within the last twenty-five years.\r\n\r\nInstead of being an Abolitionist, or a Garrisonian, and insisting upon\r\nimmediate, universal, and unconditional emancipation, he was a\r\ncolonizationist, rather tolerant of the evil, as it existed in the\r\nSouth, and very patient under the wrongs of our black brethren; and so\r\nwas I.\r\n\r\nInstead of being a teetotaler, he was hardly what the temperance men of\r\nour day would call a temperance man; for he had wine upon his table when\r\nhe gave dinners, and never shrank from the interchange of courtesies,\r\nnor refused a pledge,--though I did, even then. Yet more, as brandy had\r\nbeen prescribed for Mrs. Pierpont by the family physician, Dr. Randall,\r\nher husband used to take his brandy and water with her sometimes, just\r\nbefore dinner, by way of a \"whet.\"\r\n\r\nAgain: he had been brought up, like St. Paul, at the very feet of\r\nGamaliel. He was born Orthodox,--he lived Orthodox,--he sat for years\r\nunder the preaching of Dr. Lyman Beecher, whom he looked upon as a\r\n\"giant among pygmies,\"--and well he might, as a metaphysician and as a\r\ncontroversialist, if not as a theologian,--and was, I have lately been\r\ntold, a member of Dr. Spring's Orthodox church at Newburyport, before\r\nhis removal to Boston. But once there, in that overcharged atmosphere,\r\nhe took a pew in the Brattle Street Unitarian church,--without being\r\nthen a Unitarian, or dreaming of the great change that was to follow\r\nwithin two or three years,--and was a regular attendant under the\r\npreaching of Mr. Everett up to the last. On his removal to Baltimore, he\r\nswung round again toward Orthodoxy,--that Orthodoxy which has been so\r\nwittily defined as _my_ doxy, while heterodoxy is _your_ doxy,--and sat\r\nfor three years under the preaching of Dr. Ingals, the highly gifted\r\ngentleman to whom he dedicated his poem--_in blank_--when it first\r\nappeared, being perhaps a little afraid of committing himself in\r\nadvance; and then, at the very first gathering of the Baltimore\r\nUnitarians in a large auction-room, which led to the organization of a\r\nchurch within a few months, the erection of a beautiful building, and to\r\nthe settlement of our friend, the late Dr. Jared Sparks, he came out\r\nfair and square upon the great question, and led, or helped lead, the\r\nexercises. The result of which was, that in due time, after his failure\r\nin business, he became a student of theology at Cambridge, and within a\r\nyear was called to the ministry of reconciliation over Hollis Street\r\nChurch, as a successor to Mr. Holly, at that time a most captivating\r\npreacher, with a congregation and church eminently fastidious and\r\nexacting, and not easily satisfied; yet Mr. Pierpont labored with them\r\nand for them over twenty-five years, with an earnestness, a\r\ncomprehensiveness, and a faithfulness, for which some of them have not\r\nforgiven him to this day. He entered upon the ministry there in April,\r\n1819, and resigned in 1845; when he became the first pastor of a\r\nUnitarian church in Troy, remained there four years, and then took\r\ncharge of a church in Medford; where he was living when the Rebellion\r\nbroke out, and he entered the army as chaplain, under an express\r\nstipulation that the regiment was _not to go round Baltimore_.\r\n\r\nBut I am fully justified in saying that, when I first knew him in\r\nBoston, he did not know himself. He had entirely mistaken his vocation,\r\nand was about the last man in the world to enter into trade, though\r\npre-eminently fitted for business, if he had been properly\r\nencouraged,--the business of law certainly, and the business of\r\nstatesmanship. He saw nothing of what was before him,--nothing of the\r\nfield he was to occupy till the Master came,--nothing of the influence,\r\nnothing of the authority, he was to exercise over the minds and hearts\r\nof men,--and nothing of that huge oriflamme which was coming up slowly,\r\nto be sure, but certainly, over the distant verge of an ever-widening\r\nhorizon. He was utterly discouraged as a lawyer; he knew nothing of\r\nbusiness; he had no capital; and what on earth was he good for? Whither\r\nshould he go? What undertake?\r\n\r\nAnd yet he bore up manfully through all this discouragement, and no word\r\nof complaint or murmuring ever escaped his lips. On the whole, he was\r\none of the most truly conscientious men I ever knew,--and why not one\r\nof the most truly religious, notwithstanding his obnoxious faith?--so\r\neven-tempered that I never saw him disturbed more than once or twice in\r\nall my life, and so patient under wrong that one could hardly believe in\r\nhis withering sarcasm, and scorching indignation when he took the field\r\nas a reformer, \"in golden panoply complete.\"\r\n\r\nLet me now describe his personal appearance, for the help of those who\r\nhave only heard of the man. He was tall, straight, and spare,--six feet,\r\nI should say, and rather ungraceful in fact, though called by the women\r\nof his parish, not only the most graceful, but the most finished of\r\ngentlemen. That he was dignified, courteous, and prepossessing, very\r\npleasant in conversation, a capital story-teller, and a tolerable--no,\r\nintolerable--punster, exceedingly impressive both in the pulpit and\r\nelsewhere, when much in earnest, and in after life a great lecturer and\r\nplatform speaker, I am ready to acknowledge; but he wanted ease of\r\nmanner--the readiness and quiet self-possession of a high-bred man, who\r\ncannot be taken by surprise, and is neither afraid of being\r\nmisunderstood nor afraid of letting himself down--till after he had\r\npassed the age of threescore.\r\n\r\nThe first impression he made on me was that of a country schoolmaster,\r\nor of a professor, on his good behavior, who had got his notions of the\r\npolite world from Chesterfield; though, when I knew him better, and\r\nlearned that he had been a tutor in the Alston family of South Carolina,\r\nI detected the original type of his perpendicularity, serious composure,\r\nand stateliness,--the archetype. I was constantly reminded of John C.\r\nCalhoun, a fellow-student with him at Yale, and a man he always\r\nmentioned, with a strange mixture of admiration and awe, as if he\r\nthought him an offshoot from the Archfiend himself, \"skilled to make the\r\nworse appear the better reason.\" His tall figure, his erect, positive\r\nbearing, and somewhat uncompromising, severe expression of countenance,\r\nwhen much in earnest, with black, heavy eyebrows, clear blue eyes which\r\npassed for black, and stiff black hair, were all of that Huguenot\r\nSouthern type, which, like the signs of the Scotch Covenanter or of the\r\nold English Puritan, are as unlikely to die out as the Canada thistle,\r\nwhere they who sow the wind are content to reap the whirlwind. In their\r\nsteadfast pertinacity, whether right or wrong, in their adamantine\r\nlogic, as unyielding as death, and calm, serious energy of action, and\r\nin a part of their transcendental theories, they were alike; and alike,\r\ntoo, in their tried honesty. The great Nullifier and the great Reformer\r\nwere both Titanic, in the vastness and comprehensiveness of their views,\r\nin their unrelenting self-assertion, in their metaphysics, and in their\r\ntheories of government. If the dark Southron made open war upon his\r\ncountry till it grew to be unsafe, the dark Northerner would tear the\r\nConstitution of that country to tatters, and trample it under foot, as\r\nhe did upon one occasion, without remorse or compunction, because it was\r\nheld by others to give property in man, though for himself he denied\r\nthat it did so, or that it sanctioned slavery in any shape,--as he did,\r\nI say, though I was not an eyewitness of the outrage, and have only the\r\nreport from others who were. If it was only a flourish, like that of\r\nEdmund Burke, when he suddenly lugged out the dagger before the upturned\r\nsmiling eyes of his patient compeers, and Sheridan--or was it\r\nFox?--begged the gentleman to tell him where the _fork_ was to be had\r\nwhich belonged to the knife, why, even that were not only unworthy of\r\nthe man, but so utterly unlike him, for he never indulged in rhetoric or\r\nrhodomontade or claptrap, that one would be inclined to think he was\r\nbeside himself, or had been dining out, like Daniel Webster when he\r\nproposed, in the Senate Chamber, to plant our starry banner on the\r\noutermost verge, the Ultima Thule, of our disputed territory, heedless\r\nof consequences. Both Pierpont and Calhoun certainly forgot the\r\ninjunction to be \"temperate in all things\"; and allow me to add, that,\r\nin my judgment, it mattered little who was with, or who against them,\r\nafter they had once set the lance in rest, with a windmill in\r\nview,--they only spurred the harder for opposition, and lashed out all\r\nthe more vehemently for being cheered, even by the lowliest.\r\nEncouragement and opposition were alike to both, after the rowels were\r\nset, and their beavers closed.\r\n\r\nAt the time I speak of, Mr. Pierpont and his brother-in-law, Mr. Joseph\r\nL. Lord, kept house together on a street running down hill back of the\r\nState-House,--Hancock Street, if I do not mistake. They had always two\r\nor three boarders, and sometimes more, and among them Erastus A. Lord, a\r\nbrother of Joseph, and myself. With these, and with the neighbors,--the\r\nwhole neighborhood, I might say, and with all their visiting-list,--our\r\nfriend Pierpont was an oracle from the first, and in the church and\r\nparish, after he had been set up in the pulpit, an idol. It was thought\r\npresumptuous for anybody to differ with him upon any subject. Whatever\r\nhe said, or thought, or did, was never to be questioned,--never! His\r\nopinions were maxims, his utterances apothegms, his lightest word\r\nauthority. And the worst of it all, and the hardest thing for me to\r\nstomach, was, that in all our controversies, for a long time, if he was\r\nnot always right, and I always wrong, I was quite sure to come out\r\nsecond best, in the judgment of his friends and worshippers, who had no\r\nsympathy for anybody who ventured to tilt with their champion.\r\nNevertheless I persisted, and, not standing much in awe of the pedant\r\nand the pedagogue, however much I admired the logician and the poet or\r\nthe lawyer, I lost no opportunity of asserting my independence, and\r\ntook, I am afraid, a sort of malicious pleasure in showing that I had\r\nviews and opinions of my own, and was determined to do my own thinking,\r\ncome what might. For a while this operated against me,--if not always\r\nwith Mr. Pierpont, certainly with all his immediate personal friends and\r\nfamily; but in time, I believe, he began to like me the better for my\r\npresumption, or foolhardiness, in battling the watch with him, whenever\r\nhe laid down a proposition, with a calm, dictatorial air, which did not\r\nstrike me at first either as clearly self-evident, or, after a thorough\r\ninvestigation, as indisputably true, so that I do on my conscience\r\nbelieve that I was fast growing, not only unmanageable, but unbearable.\r\n\r\nMr. Pierpont was no judge of painting, though he relished a good\r\npicture, and had no taste for drawing, or rather no talent for drawing,\r\nthough he saw readily enough certain errors of exaggeration that\r\nabounded in the engravings of the day; and I well remember his calling\r\nmy attention to the preposterously small feet of the female figures for\r\nwhich Messrs. Draper and Company, the bank-note engravers of that day,\r\nwere so famous; and yet his handwriting was very beautiful, and the\r\nciphers I have mentioned were neither more nor less than exquisite\r\ndrawings. Nor had he any ear for music, to borrow the language we hear\r\nat every turn,--as if all persons who are not deaf by nature had not\r\nears for music, so far as they can hear at all,--or as if he who can\r\ndistinguish voices, or learn a language, so far as to be understood when\r\nhe talks it, had not necessarily an ear for music, in other words, an\r\near for sounds and for the rhythm of speech; but he was deficient in the\r\norgan of tune, phrenologically speaking, though I have heard him\r\nwarble a Scotch air on the flute with uncommon sweetness--and\r\nfeebleness--without _tonguing_, and play two or three other tunes, which\r\nhad been adapted in the choir of his church, upon glass goblets, partly\r\nfilled with water and set upon a table before him, as if he enjoyed\r\nevery touch and thrill,--his long, thin fingers travelling over the damp\r\nedges of the glass, and bringing forth \"Bonnie Doon,\" or \"There's\r\nnothing true but Heaven,\"--with his cuffs rolled up as if he were\r\ndriving a lathe, and turning off some of the little thin boxes and other\r\nexquisite toys, in wood or ivory, which he was addicted to, about\r\nfifteen years ago, in what he called his workshop. Like Johnson,\r\nhowever, and Alexander Pope, who, according to Leigh Hunt,\r\n\r\n                \"Spoiled the ears of the town\r\n    With his cuckoo-song verses, two up and two down,\"\r\n\r\nhe must have had \"time\" large; for the music of his rhythm was\r\nabsolutely faultless,--cloying indeed, so that he introduced the double\r\nrhymes to roughen it, just as he indulged in alliteration, where the\r\n\"lordly lion leaves his lonely lair,\" that he might not be supposed\r\nincapable of running off upon another track, or into another channel.\r\n\r\nBut I never heard him sing or try to sing, though he had a deep, manly\r\nvoice, read as very few are able to read, and his modulation was rich\r\nand varied, and very agreeable, both to the understanding and the ear.\r\n\r\nHis pronunciation was a marvel for correctness. In all our intercourse I\r\nnever knew him to give a word otherwise than \"according to Walker,\" so\r\nlong as Walker was the standard with him,--or never but once, when he\r\nsaid cli-mac'ter-ic, instead of cli-mac-ter'ic; and when I remonstrated\r\nwith him, he lugged out Webster, whom he adhered to forever after. So\r\nexceedingly fastidious and sensitive was he, about the time he left\r\nBaltimore for Cambridge, that in his desire to give the pure sound of\r\n_e_, as in _met_, instead of the sound of _u_, which is so common as to\r\nbe almost universal where _e_ is followed by _r_ and another consonant,\r\nso that _person_ is pronounced _purson_, he gave a sound which most\r\npeople misunderstood for _pairson_, and went away and laughed at, for\r\npedantry and affectation.\r\n\r\nSo, too, when I first knew him, and for a long time after, he was\r\nincapable of making a speech. Even a few sentences were too much for\r\nhim; and though he argued at least one case to the court, while in\r\nbusiness at Newburyport, I am persuaded, from what I afterward knew of\r\nhim, that he must have done what he did by jerks, or have committed the\r\nwhole to memory. And this, strange as it may now appear to those who\r\nknew him only as a lecturer and platform-speaker, continued long after\r\nhe had entered upon the ministry; but of this more hereafter. Even his\r\nprayers were written out, and learned by heart, years after he took\r\ncharge of the Hollis Street Church, though I dare say it was not known\r\nby his people. Perhaps, too, I may as well say here, lest I may forget\r\nto say it hereafter, that, at the time I speak of, he was neither a\r\nphrenologist, nor a spiritualist, nor a conscientious believer in\r\nwitchcraft, or rather in the phenomena that used to be called\r\nwitchcraft, in the days of Cotton Mather.\r\n\r\nSoon after the beginning of our acquaintance, Mr. Joseph L. Lord, the\r\nbrother of his first wife,--and he too has just passed away,--seeing\r\nwhat the prospect was for the brother-in-law he was so proud of,\r\npersuaded him to abandon the law at once, and forever, and go into the\r\njobbing and retail dry-goods business with him, on the corner of Court\r\nand Marlborough, now Washington Street. He had no capital, to be sure,\r\nbut then he wrote a beautiful hand, was very methodical, and had made\r\nhimself acquainted with bookkeeping, after the Italian method, from\r\nRees's Cyclopædia. I took the chamber which Mr. Pierpont left, and went\r\ninto the jobbing business also, with a capital of between two and three\r\nhundred--dollars, and a credit amounting to perhaps five hundred more,\r\nwhich enterprise terminated after a few months, not in my failure, but\r\nin my taking a trip to New York with a large quantity of smuggled goods,\r\nbelonging to Messrs. Pierpont and Lord, where I disposed of them to such\r\nadvantage, that, on my return, I was persuaded to go into the retail\r\nhaberdashery line, at 103 Court Street, next door to Pierpont and Lord,\r\nand just underneath the chamber, not chambers, which I had occupied at\r\nfirst with my wholesale establishment. I had for a partner, at first,\r\nErastus, a brother of \"Joe's,\" whom I had known as a bookbinder in\r\nPortland two or three years before. He was now manufacturing\r\npocket-books, and appeared to be doing, not only a large and profitable,\r\nbut safe business,--selling for cash, running a horse and gig, and\r\npaying the bills of all the \"dear five hundred friends\" who rode with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nOur copartnership did not last long. His brother \"Joe,\" being a shrewd\r\nman of business, of uncommon foresight and comprehensiveness, though\r\nrather adventurous, gave me a hint, and soon provided me with another\r\npartner, a graduate of Cambridge, named Fisher, with whom I was\r\nassociated a few months longer. Then came the peace of 1815, which threw\r\nthe whole country into a paroxysm of joy, unsettling business\r\neverywhere, at home and abroad, and setting people together by the ears\r\nupon all the great questions of the day.\r\n\r\nAnd here began the new and very brief career of Mr. Pierpont as a man of\r\nbusiness. Wholly unfitted as he was for even the regular course of\r\ntrade, he was the last man in the world for the great emergencies of the\r\nhour. The whole business of the country was little better than gambling.\r\nOur largest importing houses were lotteries or faro-banks; and we had no\r\nmanufactures worth mentioning. We made no woollen goods, and our few\r\ncottons, if sold at all, were sold for British, and stood no chance with\r\nthe trash that came from beyond the Cape of Good Hope, \"warped with\r\nhoop-poles, and filled with oven-wood.\" Our foreign merchandise came\r\ntumbling down so fast, that no prospective calculations could be made\r\nupon their value. Not having manufactured ourselves, we knew nothing\r\nabout the cost of production, and had no idea how much our friends over\r\nsea could afford to fall, even from the lowest prices ever heard of.\r\nBritish calicoes, or prints, for example, which I sold by the case for\r\neighty-five cents cash, at auction, were in every way inferior to our\r\nown, which were retailed before the Rebellion broke out for ten cents a\r\nyard. In fact, if we had known the real cost of production, it would\r\nhave made but little difference; for long after all our foreign\r\nmerchandise had fallen from thirty-three and a third to fifty per cent,\r\nsome of our shrewdest calculators were utterly ruined by purchasing at\r\nmuch lower prices, on what they believed to be a rising market.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances, what was a poet, a scholar, and a lawyer,\r\nwithout any knowledge of business, to do? Pierpont and Lord were large\r\ndealers, and had a heavy stock on hand, not paid for. Their notes were\r\nmaturing with frightful rapidity, and Mr. Lord wanted all his available\r\nfunds for \"transactions\" in gold, and other perilous \"operations\" along\r\nthe Canada frontier. Specie was twenty-five per cent above par, or\r\nrather banknotes, everywhere but in a part of New England, where they\r\ncontinued to pay specie to the last, were at twenty-five per cent\r\ndiscount; and \"Boston money,\" upon the average, about one per cent above\r\ngold and silver, so as to cover the cost and risk of transportation.\r\n\r\nBut something had to be done. A consultation was held between the\r\nmembers of \"our house,\" and it was finally arranged that Mr. Pierpont,\r\nas the man we could best spare from the salesroom and the shop, and the\r\npartner who would best represent what was called, with singular\r\npropriety, \"our concern,\" should go to Baltimore with the best of\r\nletters, and open a way for me in that city, which I had visited once,\r\nand once only, for the purpose of buying exchange on England,--though\r\nfor a time it was thought I had run away with all the funds intrusted to\r\nme. I had taken a prodigious liking to Baltimore from the first, though\r\nI had no idea of going there to live, and was not easily persuaded to\r\ngive up my little establishment in Boston. I was doing very well, and\r\ndid not care to do better, till business got settled; but we were three,\r\nand I was always in the minority,--Mr. Lord being a shrewd \"operator,\"\r\nand Mr. Pierpont, of course, deferring to him. They were _my_ partners,\r\nto be sure; but I never had anything to do with their business, apart\r\nfrom my own.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, when Mr. Pierpont returned, and gave an account of his\r\ndoings there, and of the opening there was for just such a man as I had\r\nproved myself to be, I consented to pull up stakes, and transplant\r\nmyself to that beautiful city.\r\n\r\nI went with no large expectations, intending to open a retail shop, such\r\nas I had left; but within a week, finding that I could sell even my cut\r\ngoods for prices much beyond what I had been retailing them for over and\r\nabove the exchange, I went into the wholesale business, and with one\r\nclerk, Mr. Jenkins Howland, greatly distinguished in after life as a man\r\nof enterprise at Charleston, S.C., sold more goods, and for cash too,\r\nthan perhaps any three or four of what were called the large dealers\r\nabout me, with two or three clerks apiece, and at prices which fairly\r\ntook away my breath at first;--Irish linens, for example, by the case at\r\ntwo dollars and fifty cents all round, worth not over eighty cents\r\nbefore the war; and assorted broadcloths by the bale at fourteen dollars\r\na yard all round, which, within a twelvemonth, would have hung fire at\r\nthree dollars and fifty cents. And this, it will be remembered, was\r\nafter goods had been falling--falling--falling--for six months.\r\n\r\nNo wonder people's heads were turned--those of Pierpont and Lord among\r\nthe rest. We, who had large stocks on hand, were growing rich too fast.\r\nI remember selling fourteen thousand dollars' worth of goods one day for\r\na clear profit of more than forty per cent, and this while my poor\r\nfriends at Boston were gasping for breath in that exhausted receiver;\r\nbut they were kept alive by the remittances I made from Baltimore, which\r\nnot only furnished them with funds for immediate use, but gave them for\r\na few months almost unbounded credit.\r\n\r\nThis was in the fall and winter of 1815, only a few months after the\r\nBramble arrived with the news from Ghent that our last negotiations had\r\nbeen successful, and that the war was over most gloriously for _us_, the\r\nUnited States. We were almost ready, in our thankfulness and joy, to\r\ncanonize the ship and crew, and cut her up into snuffboxes and\r\ntoothpicks.\r\n\r\nAnd now--what next? \"as the tadpole said, when he his tail dropped off.\"\r\nWeary of the growing distrust they saw, after my remittances began to\r\nfall off, and heartily sick of the Gerrymandering about them, of the\r\nusurers and money-changers and Shylocks, who were bleeding them to\r\ndeath, by lending them money upon pledges of merchandise, the two elder\r\npartners, Pierpont and Lord, lost no time in following their junior. He\r\nhad opened on South Calvert Street; they took the whole of a large\r\nbuilding opposite, opened below their wholesale business, and after a\r\nfew months went to housekeeping overhead, both families living together.\r\nThen, to get rid of our stock, Mr. Pierpont went off to Charleston,\r\nS.C., where he had served his time as a tutor, and there set up a retail\r\nestablishment, under the charge of a former clerk in their service, and\r\nof another man, a heartless vagabond, whom they had happened to get\r\nacquainted with at a boarding-house on their first arrival, and took a\r\nfancy to, nobody ever knew why. He was an Englishman, had probably been\r\nupon the stage, and lived from hand to mouth, nobody knew how, until we\r\ntook him _up_, and he took us _in_ most pitiably.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief struggle, and the establishment of another retail store in\r\nCalvert Street, which I took charge of, with what there was left of the\r\nCharleston adventure, we failed outright, and all this within six or\r\neight months after we had called our creditors together and obtained an\r\nextension of twelve months and testimonials in our favor of the most\r\ngratifying character, and within little more than a year after leaving\r\nBoston.\r\n\r\nAnd then, for want of anything better to do, I began writing for the\r\npapers, for the \"Portico,\" and at last for the public, as an editor and\r\nas an author, mainly at the instigation of Mr. Pierpont, for whom I\r\nwrote both \"Niagara\"[1] and \"Guldau,\" and a part of \"Allen's\" American\r\nRevolution, studying law, and languages by the half-dozen at the same\r\ntime, and laboring upon the average about sixteen hours a day, while Mr.\r\nPierpont struck out boldly for a far-off perilous and rocky shore, with\r\na lighthouse, in the shape of a pulpit, before him, and achieved the\r\n\"Airs of Palestine\" while undergoing the process of regeneration, and\r\nstarving by inches upon what there were left of his wife's teaspoons,\r\nwhich were sold one by one to pay the rent of a cheap room in Howard\r\nStreet. So poor indeed were we at one time, that we could hardly muster\r\nenough between us to pay our bootblack.\r\n\r\nI have already said that Mr. Pierpont had no aptitude for extemporaneous\r\nspeaking; and what was even worse, he had no hope of being able to\r\novercome the difficulty. Once, and once only, did I ever hear him try\r\nhis hand in that way, until many years after he had entered upon the\r\nministry. A club had been organized among us for literary purposes. We\r\nwere both members, and he the Vice-President. We called ourselves the\r\nDelphians, and passed among our contemporaries for the _male_ Muses, our\r\nnumber being limited to nine,--not seven, as I see it stated in the\r\nBoston Advertiser, on the authority of our friend Paul Allen. The rest\r\nof the story is near enough to the truth, although the verses therein\r\nmentioned were written by Mr. Pierpont as a volunteer offering, after\r\nthe Della-Cruscan school, or manner of \"Laura Matilda,\" and not upon the\r\nspur of the occasion, as there related, nor as a trial of wit; and the\r\nlast line should be, \"Pulls where'er the zephyr _roves_\"--not, as given\r\nthere, \"Pulls where'er the zephyr moves.\"\r\n\r\nIt was in this club that Mr. Pierpont first tried himself--and the\r\nbrethren--with extemporaneous speaking. It was a pitiable failure, worse\r\nif possible than my own, and I never made another attempt. Even General\r\nWinder, who was a fine advocate, and a capital speaker before a jury,\r\nboggled wretchedly before the club, and our President, Watkins, who was\r\nsaid to be exceedingly eloquent before the great Masonic lodges, where\r\nhe occupied the highest position, could not be persuaded to open his\r\nmouth, and all the rest of the brethren were mutes. True, it was like\r\napostrophizing your own grandmother, in the hope of raising a laugh or\r\nof bringing tears into her eyes, to make speeches at one another across\r\nthe table, whatever Molière might be able to do, when alone with his\r\naged servant. Nor did it much help the matter, when, with a view to the\r\ntreasury, which began to threaten a collapse, we made a law, like that\r\nof the Medes and Persians which altereth not, whereby it was provided,\r\namong other things, that no member should ever talk over five minutes,\r\nnor stop short of three, under any circumstances,--the President being\r\ntimekeeper, and the sufferer not being allowed to look at a watch. Fines\r\nof course were inevitable, and we were once more able to luxuriate on\r\nbread and cheese, with an occasional pot of beer,--nothing better or\r\nstronger being tolerated among us under any pretence, except on our\r\nanniversaries, when the President, or sometimes a member, stood treat,\r\nand gave us a comfortable, though not often a costly or showy supper.\r\n\r\nAmong that strange, whimsical brotherhood--consisting of Dr. Tobias\r\nWatkins, editor of the \"Portico\"; General Winder (William H.), who had\r\nbeen \"captivated\" by the British, along with General Chandler, at the\r\nfirst invasion of Canada; William Gwin, editor of the \"Federal Gazette\";\r\nPaul Allen, editor of the \"Federal Republican,\" and of Lewis and\r\nClarke's \"Tour,\" and author of \"Noah\"; Dr. Readel, \"a fellow of infinite\r\njest\"; Brackenridge, author of \"Views in Louisiana,\" and \"History of the\r\nWar\"; Dennison, an Englishman, who wrote clever doggerel; and, at\r\ndifferent times, two or three more, not worth mentioning, even if I\r\nremembered their names--we passed every Saturday evening, after the club\r\nwas established, until it was broken up by President Watkins's going to\r\nWashington, Vice-President Pierpont to the Divinity School at Cambridge,\r\nand Jehu O'Cataract abroad. All the members bore \"clubicular\" names, by\r\nwhich they were always to be addressed or spoken to, under another\r\npenalty; and most of them held \"clubicular\" offices and\r\nprofessorships,--Dr. Readel being Professor of Crambography, and\r\nsomebody else--Gwin perhaps--Professor of Impromptology. The name given\r\nto Mr. Pierpont was Hiero Heptaglott, under an idea that he was a\r\nprodigious linguist,--another Sir William Jones, at least, if not\r\nanother Learned Blacksmith; and the President himself went so far as to\r\nsay so in the \"Portico,\" where he pretended to give an account of the\r\nDelphians. Nothing could well be further from the truth, however; for,\r\ninstead of being a great Hebrew scholar, and learned in the Chaldee,\r\nCoptic, and other Eastern languages, he knew very little of Hebrew, and\r\nabsolutely nothing of the rest. With \"a little Latin and less Greek,\" he\r\nwas a pretty fair Latin and Greek scholar in the judgment of those who\r\nare satisfied with what we are doing in our colleges; and he was\r\nsufficiently acquainted with French to enjoy Chateaubriand, St. Pierre,\r\nRousseau, and Lamartine, and to write the language with correctness,\r\nthough not idiomatically; but he was never able to make himself\r\nunderstood in conversation, beyond a few phrases, uttered with a\r\ndeplorable accent,--not being able to carry the flavor in his\r\nmouth,--and, though free and sprightly enough in talking English, having\r\nno idea of what passes for freedom and sprightliness with the French. He\r\nknew nothing of Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, German, or Dutch, nor\r\nindeed of any other modern language.\r\n\r\nAnd now let me say how he came to be an extemporaneous speaker, and\r\nsometimes not only logical and convincing, but truly eloquent. On my\r\nreturn from abroad, in 1826, I passed through Boston, on my way to\r\nPortland, for a visit to my family, and was taken possession of by him,\r\nand went to Hollis Street Church, where I heard my friend, for the\r\nsecond time, in the pulpit. He was exceedingly impressive, and the\r\nsermon itself was one of the best I ever heard,--calm, serious, and\r\nsatisfying; not encumbered with illustration, but full of significance.\r\nAlthough the discourse was carefully written out, word for word, and\r\nalmost committed to memory, yet he ventured to introduce a\r\nparagraph--one paragraph only--which had not been prepared beforehand.\r\nMy eyes were upon him, and he told me at dinner that he saw by my look\r\nhow well I understood his departure, and how soon I detected it. \"And\r\nnow,\" said he, \"I hope you are satisfied. You see now that I shall never\r\nbe able to extemporize. I put that paragraph into my sermon this morning\r\nto see how you would take it, after having urged me, year after year, to\r\nextemporize at least occasionally. No, no, John; though writing two\r\nsermons a week is no trifling labor, I must continue writing to the end;\r\nfor, if I cannot extemporize a single paragraph, how can I hope to\r\nextemporize a whole sermon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Suffer me to say that I think you misunderstand the whole question,\"\r\nsaid I. \"The difficulty is in beginning. After you are well under way,\r\nif you can talk sitting, you may talk standing. Better take with you\r\ninto the pulpit the merest outline of the discourse, and then trust to\r\nthe inspiration of the subject, or to the feeling of the hour, when you\r\nhave the audience before you, and can look into their eyes, than to have\r\na discourse partly written, with blanks to be filled up as you go along;\r\nfor then you are always beginning afresh, and by the time you have got\r\neasy in your spontaneous effort, you are obliged to go back to what you\r\nhave written, and of course can never get warmed up with your subject,\r\nnor try any new adaptations, whatever may be the character of your\r\nhearers.\"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. \"No, no,\" said he, \"you will never be able to\r\npersuade me that it is easier to say over the whole alphabet than to say\r\nonly a part.\"\r\n\r\nI persisted, urging the great advantage of spontaneous adaptation to the\r\npeople. He agreed with me altogether, provided it were _possible_ for\r\nhim to do it, which he denied, though he promised to take the subject\r\ninto serious consideration once more, to oblige me.\r\n\r\nFrom Boston I went to Portland, where I had a similar talk with that\r\nmost amiable and excellent man, the late Dr. Nichols, who labored under\r\na similar disqualification, owing to a similar misapprehension of what\r\nwas required for extemporaneous speaking, either on the platform or in\r\nthe pulpit. I told him the story, and urged the same considerations; but\r\nhe, like Mr. Pierpont, only smiled,--compassionately, as I thought, and\r\nrather as if he pitied the delusion I was laboring under. Yet within two\r\nyears both of these remarkable men became free and natural spontaneous\r\nspeakers, and both acknowledged to me that they had always misunderstood\r\nthe difficulty. Dr. Nichols began afar off, as I suggested, in the\r\nSabbath school; and Mr. Pierpont, after making two or three attempts in\r\na small way, which were anything but satisfactory to himself,--as I told\r\nhim they would be for a while, if he had the true stuff in him,--was at\r\nlast surprised into doing what he believed to be impossible, by the\r\nmerest accident in the world; after which he had no further trouble. It\r\nseems that he had engaged to supply a neighboring pulpit,--perhaps that\r\nof his son John, who was newly settled at Lynn. He thought he had his\r\nsermon in his pocket; but, on entering the pulpit, found that he had\r\neither left it at home or lost it on the way. What was to be done?\r\nLuckily, he had just read it over the night before, and was full of the\r\nsubject therein treated. Remembering what I said, as he told me himself,\r\nhe determined to go to work, hit or miss, and either make a spoon or\r\nspoil a horn.\r\n\r\nThe result was, that, after a little hesitation and floundering, he got\r\nfairly in earnest, and threw off a discourse which so delighted those\r\nwho were best acquainted with him, that they stopped round the door to\r\nshake hands and congratulate him. He had never preached so well in all\r\nhis life, they said. This settled the question forever; and from that\r\nday forward he began to believe that anybody who can talk in his chair\r\ncan talk standing up, after he has got over his first impressions, and\r\nall the better for having a large auditory, with upturned faces, before\r\nhim; so that he became at last, and within a few years, one of the\r\nfinest pulpit orators of the day, and one of the best platform speakers,\r\nthough not, perhaps, what the multitude consider eloquent; for, at the\r\nbest, he was only argumentative and earnest and clear and convincing, in\r\nhis highest manifestations.\r\n\r\nOf his career after this, I cannot say anything as I wish, without the\r\nrisk of saying too much. He had one of the wealthiest and most liberal\r\ncongregations of New England. He was their idol. He was in every way\r\nmost agreeably situated, with a large family flowering into usefulness\r\nabout him, and hosts of friends, enthusiastic and devoted.\r\nNevertheless, believing that, as a servant of God, he had no right to\r\npreach smooth things where rough things were needed, and that\r\nacknowledging other people's transgressions would not satisfy the law,\r\nhe came out boldly, with helm and spear, against two of the worst forms\r\nof human slavery,--the slavery of the body and the slavery of the soul,\r\nthe slavery of the wine-cup, and the slavery of bondage to a master.\r\nWhether his beloved people would hear or whether they would forbear,\r\nbeing all the more beloved because of their danger, he must preach what\r\nhe believed to be the truth, and the whole truth. It was like a fire\r\nshut up in his bones. He persisted, and they remonstrated, or rather a\r\npart of them did so; and the result was a speedy and hopeless\r\nalienation, followed by years of strife and bitter controversy at law,\r\nand a final separation; though by far the larger part of the church and\r\ncongregation, if I do not mistake, upheld him to the last, and adhered\r\nto him through good report and through evil report,--Deacon Samuel May,\r\na host in himself, being of their number.\r\n\r\nDuring this protracted and sorrowful controversy, he became a\r\nphrenologist,--a believer in phrenology,--at any rate, following the\r\nlead of Spurzheim; and after many years, a Spiritualist,--in which faith\r\nhe died,--one of his last, if not the very last, of his appearances\r\nbefore the public being as President of a convention held by the leading\r\nSpiritualists of the land at Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nHe could not be a materialist; and having faith in the evidence of his\r\nown senses, and being as truly conscientious a man as ever breathed, and\r\naccustomed to the closest reasoning, what was he to do? There were the\r\n_facts_. They were not to be controverted; they could not be explained;\r\nthey could not be reconciled to any hypothesis in physics. If he was\r\ngiven over to delusion, to be buffeted by Satan, whose fault was it?\r\nThat he was by nature somewhat credulous, and, though patient enough in\r\nhis investigations, rather too fond of the marvellous, may be\r\nacknowledged; but what then? His conclusions might be wrong, his\r\ninferences faulty, though honest; but how were they to be counteracted?\r\nThat he sometimes took too much for granted, I believe, nay, more, _I\r\nknow_; because I myself have seen him grossly imposed on by a woman he\r\ntook me to see, whose impersonations were thought most wonderful. But\r\nthen he was a devout man, a close observer, an admirable logician,\r\naccustomed to the \"competition of opposite analogies\" and to weighing\r\nevidence; and if he misunderstood the _facts_, or misinterpreted them,\r\nor inferred the supernatural from false premises, why then let us grieve\r\nfor his delusion, and wait patiently for the phenomena which led him\r\nastray to be explained.\r\n\r\nHe went abroad for a time, while pastor of the Hollis Street Church, and\r\nvisited the Holy Land, in devout pilgrimage; and though he lost his\r\nfirst wife, the mother of all his children, and a most worthy\r\ngentlewoman, but the other day, and married another superior woman after\r\na brief widowhood, his last days have been, I should say, most\r\nemphatically his best days; for he has lectured through the length and\r\nbreadth of the land on Temperance, and, after enduring all sorts of\r\npersecution as one of the anti-slavery leaders, he lived to see the\r\nwhole system against which they had been warring so long, and with so\r\nlittle apparent effect, utterly overthrown throughout the land, and the\r\ngreat God of heaven and earth acknowledged as the God of the black man.\r\nThousands and thousands of miles he travelled, not only after having\r\npassed the meridian of his life, but after he had reached the allotted\r\nterm, when life begins to be a heaviness for most, as a laborer in the\r\ncause of truth,--often of unacknowledged truth; and if mistaken, as a\r\ntheologian, or as a Spiritualist, or as a man,--being what he was,--let\r\nus remember that he was never false to his convictions, never a\r\nhypocrite nor a deceiver, and that he died with his harness on, having\r\nbeen occupied for the last five years of his life in digesting the\r\ntreasury decisions, often contradictory, and always inaccessible, for\r\nthere was no index, until he took them in hand, going back thirty years,\r\nI believe, and reducing the whole to a system which need be no longer\r\nunintelligible to the Department.\r\n\r\nOne word more. Among the scores of letters I had from him in the day of\r\nhis bitterest trials and sorest temptations, there was one which he sent\r\noff in the midst of his first great triumph,--with no date now, although\r\nI find a mark upon it which leads me to suppose it was written November\r\n16, 1818, and from which I must venture to take a single paragraph.\r\n\r\n\"My God!\" he says,--\"my God! I do most devoutly thank Thee. My prayer\r\nhas reached Thee, and been accepted. My dear friend, join with me in\r\nthanking Him in whom I put my trust,--to whom alone I look, or to whom I\r\n_have_ looked, for a smile. He has blessed me. I have been heard by man,\r\nand have not been forsaken by God. Though I have not done _perfectly_, I\r\nhave done as well as I could rationally wish, and better than my most\r\nsanguine hopes. At Brattle Square _this_ morning, and at the New South\r\n(late Mr. Thacher's) _this_ afternoon. Lord! now let thy servant depart\r\nin peace; for thou hast lifted the cloud under which he has so long\r\nmoved, and he may now die in thy light.\"\r\n\r\nCan such a temper as this be misunderstood? Was he not a man fearing God\r\nin 1818,--forty-eight years ago?--or, rather, loving God with that\r\nperfect love which casteth out all fear?\r\n\r\nBut we need not stop here. After he had become a Spiritualist, that is,\r\non the 5th of April, 1862, the evening before his seventy-seventh\r\nbirthday, he wrote a poem of one hundred and sixty lines, entitled\r\n\"Meditations of a Birthday Eve,\" a copy of which he sent me on the 10th\r\nof November following, upon the express condition that nobody but myself\r\nwas to see it, until it should be all over with him. It must have been\r\nwritten without labor, as one would breathe a prayer upon a death-bed.\r\nThe following extracts--I wish we had room for more--will show what were\r\nhis feelings and what his aspirations at this time.\r\n\r\n    \"Spirit, my spirit, hath each stage\r\n       That brought thee up from youth\r\n     To thy now venerable age\r\n       Seen thee in search of Truth?\r\n\r\n    \"Hast thou in search of Truth been true,--\r\n       True to thyself and her,--\r\n     And been with many or with few\r\n       Her _honest_ worshipper?\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"Spirit, thy race is nearly run;\r\n       Say, hast thou run it well?\r\n     Thy work on earth is almost done;\r\n       _How_ done, no _man_ can tell.\r\n\r\n    \"Spirit, toil on! thy house, that stands\r\n       Seventy years old and seven,\r\n     Will fall; but one 'not made with hands'\r\n       Awaiteth thee in heaven.\r\n\r\n    \"WASHINGTON, D.C., 5 April, 1862.\"\r\n\r\nWith the foregoing came another poem, \"In Commemoration of a Silver\r\nWedding,\" October 2, 1863, full of tenderness and pleasantry,--the\r\nwedding of Mr. and Mrs. J. Pierpont Lord.\r\n\r\nAnd on his eighty-first birthday, called by a strange mistake his\r\neightieth, there was another celebration, yet more solemn and affecting,\r\nwhere the greetings and congratulations of his brother-poets, all over\r\nthe land, were sent to him and published in the newspapers of the day.\r\n\r\nAmong his later poems, the \"E Pluribus Unum\" appears to me most worthy\r\nof his reputation, and least like the doings of his early manhood.\r\n\r\nAnd now, though we had little reason to look for the prolongation of\r\nsuch a life;--a continued miracle from the age of thirty or thirty-five,\r\nafter which he built himself up anew, by living as well in cold water as\r\nin hot, and luxuriating in cold baths, and working hard,--harder,\r\nperhaps, on the whole, at downright drudgery, than any other man of his\r\nage, like Rousseau in copying music, as a relief from writing\r\npoetry,--yet when death happens we are all taken by surprise, just as if\r\nwe thought God had overlooked his aged servant, or made him an exception\r\nto the great, inflexible law of our being; or as if a whisper had\r\nreached us, saying, \"If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that\r\nto thee?\"\r\n\r\nBut enough; a volume of such memoranda would be far short of what such a\r\nman deserves when he is finally translated. Faithful among the\r\nfaithless, may we not hope that his grandeur and strength of purpose,\r\nand downright, fearless honesty, will have their appropriate reward,\r\nboth here and hereafter?\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] And here I may as well mention a curious incident. When I wrote my\r\npoem, I had never seen Niagara; but we agreed to go together on a\r\npilgrimage at our earliest convenience. One thing and another happened,\r\nuntil I had been abroad and returned, without our seeing it together. At\r\nlast, being about to go to the South of Europe, I made a new arrangement\r\nwith him; but just as we--my wife and I--were ready to go, he was called\r\naway to consecrate some church in the West, and we started on a journey\r\nof two thousand miles through portions of our country I had never seen,\r\nand was ashamed to go abroad again without seeing. On my way back we\r\nstopped in Buffalo, and as I stood in the piazza I saw a little card on\r\none of the pillars saying that the Rev. Mr. Pierpont would preach in the\r\nevening somewhere. I found him, and we went _together_ at last, and saw\r\nNiagara together, as we had agreed to do forty years before. And that\r\nnight the heavens rained fire upon us, and the great November\r\nstar-shooting occurred, and our landlord, being no poet, was unwilling\r\nto disturb us, so that we missed the show altogether.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMY GARDEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n    If I could put my woods in song,\r\n    And tell what's there enjoyed,\r\n    All men would to my gardens throng,\r\n    And leave the cities void.\r\n\r\n    In my plot no tulips blow,\r\n    Snow-loving pines and oaks instead,\r\n    And rank the savage maples grow\r\n    From spring's faint flush to autumn red.\r\n\r\n    My garden is a forest-ledge,\r\n    Which older forests bound;\r\n    The banks slope down to the blue lake-edge,\r\n    Then plunge in depths profound.\r\n\r\n    Here once the Deluge ploughed,\r\n    Laid the terraces, one by one;\r\n    Ebbing later whence it flowed,\r\n    They bleach and dry in the sun.\r\n\r\n    The sowers made haste to depart,\r\n    The wind and the birds which sowed it;\r\n    Not for fame, nor by rules of art,\r\n    Planted these and tempests flowed it.\r\n\r\n    Waters that wash my garden-side\r\n    Play not in Nature's lawful web,\r\n    They heed not moon or solar tide,--\r\n    Five years elapse from flood to ebb.\r\n\r\n    Hither hasted, in old time, Jove,\r\n    And every god,--none did refuse;\r\n    And be sure at last came Love,\r\n    And after Love, the Muse.\r\n\r\n    Keen ears can catch a syllable,\r\n    As if one spake to another\r\n    In the hemlocks tall, untamable,\r\n    And what the whispering grasses smother.\r\n\r\n    Æolian harps in the pine\r\n    Ring with the song of the Fates;\r\n    Infant Bacchus in the vine,--\r\n    Far distant yet his chorus waits.\r\n\r\n    Canst thou copy in verse one chime\r\n    Of the wood-bell's peal and cry?\r\n    Write in a book the morning's prime,\r\n    Or match with words that tender sky?\r\n\r\n    Wonderful verse of the gods,\r\n    Of one import, of varied tone;\r\n    They chant the bliss of their abodes\r\n    To man imprisoned in his own.\r\n\r\n    Ever the words of the gods resound,\r\n    But the porches of man's ear\r\n    Seldom in this low life's round\r\n    Are unsealed that he may hear.\r\n\r\n    Wandering voices in the air,\r\n    And murmurs in the wold,\r\n    Speak what I cannot declare,\r\n    Yet cannot all withhold.\r\n\r\n    When the shadow fell on the lake,\r\n    The whirlwind in ripples wrote\r\n    Air-bells of fortune that shine and break,\r\n    And omens above thought.\r\n\r\n    But the meanings cleave to the lake,\r\n    Cannot be carried in book or urn;\r\n    Go thy ways now, come later back,\r\n    On waves and hedges still they burn.\r\n\r\n    These the fates of men forecast,\r\n    Of better men than live to-day;\r\n    If who can read them comes at last,\r\n    He will spell in the sculpture, \"Stay.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBORNEO AND RAJAH BROOKE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOff the southeastern extremity of Asia, and separated from it by the\r\nChinese Sea, lies a cluster of great islands, comprising that portion of\r\nOceanica commonly called Malaysia. Of these islands Borneo is the most\r\nextensive, and, if you call Australia a continent, it is by far the\r\nlargest island in the world. Situated on the equator, stretching from 7°\r\nof north to 4° of south latitude, and from 108° to 119° of east\r\nlongitude, its extreme length is 800 miles, its breadth 700, and it\r\ncontains 320,000 square miles,--an area seven times as great as that of\r\nthe populous State of New York.\r\n\r\nBut though its size and importance are so great, though it was\r\ndiscovered by the Portuguese as early as 1518, though several European\r\nnations have at various times had settlements on its coasts, though it\r\nis rich in all the products of a tropical clime, and in base and\r\nprecious metals, diamonds and stones, and though its climate, contrary\r\nto what might have been expected, is in many localities salubrious even\r\nto an American or European constitution, yet until recently almost\r\nnothing was known by the world of its surface, its products, or its\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe causes of this ignorance are obvious. The very shape of Borneo is\r\nunfavorable to discovery. A lumpish mass, like Africa and Australia, the\r\nocean has nowhere pierced it with those deep bays and gulfs in which\r\ncommerce delights to find a shelter and a home. And though it has\r\nnavigable rivers, their course is through the almost impenetrable\r\nverdure of the tropics, and they reach the sea amid unwholesome jungles.\r\nThe coast, moreover, is in most places marshy and unhealthy, for the\r\ndistance of twenty or thirty miles inland; while the interior is filled\r\nwith vast forests and great mountain ranges, almost trackless to any but\r\nnative feet. Besides, the absence of all just and stable government has\r\nreduced society to a state of chaos. And to all this must be added\r\npiracy, from time immemorial sweeping the sea and ravaging the land.\r\nUnder such circumstances, if there were little opportunity for commerce,\r\nthere was none for scientific investigations; and only by the\r\nenterprises of commerce or the researches of science do we know of new\r\nand distant countries.\r\n\r\nMany races inhabit Borneo; but the Malays and Sea and Land Dyaks greatly\r\npreponderate. The Malays, who came from continental Asia, are the\r\nconquering and governing race. In their native condition they are\r\nindolent, treacherous, and given to piracy. The very name Malay has come\r\nto stand for cruelty and revenge. But well governed, they prove to be\r\nmuch like other people, susceptible to kindness, capable of affection,\r\namiable, fond to excess of their children, and courteous to strangers.\r\nThe Sea Dyaks are piratical tribes, dwelling on the coasts or borders of\r\nrivers, and subsisting by rapine and violence. The Land Dyaks are the\r\ndescendants of the primitive inhabitants. They are a mild, industrious\r\nrace, and remarkably honest. One hideous custom, that of preserving the\r\nheads of their fallen enemies as ghastly tokens of victory, has invested\r\nthe name of Dyak with a reputation of cruelty which is not deserved.\r\nThis singular practice, originating, it is said, in a superstitious\r\ndesire to propitiate the Evil Spirit by bloody offerings, has in process\r\nof time become connected with all their ideas of manly prowess. The\r\nyoung girl receives with proud satisfaction from her lover the gift of a\r\ngory head, as the noblest proof both of his affection and his heroism.\r\nThis custom is woven, too, into the early traditions of the race. The\r\nSakarrans tell us that their first mother, who dwells now in heaven\r\nnear the evening star, asked of her wooer a worthy gift; and that when\r\nhe presented her a deer she rejected it with contempt; when he offered\r\nher a mias, the great orang-outang of Borneo, she turned her back upon\r\nit; but when in desperation he went out and slew a man, brought back his\r\nhead, and threw it at her feet, she smiled upon him, and said that was\r\nindeed a gift worthy of her. This legend shows, at any rate, how fixed\r\nis this habit, not alone in the passions of the people, but also in\r\ntheir traditional regard. Yet, strange as it may seem, they are an\r\nattractive race. A missionary's wife who has known them well declares\r\nthat they are gentle and kindly, simple as children, disposed to love\r\nand reverence all who are wiser and more civilized than themselves. Ida\r\nPfeiffer concludes that the Dyaks pleased her best, not only among the\r\nraces of Borneo, but among all the races of the earth with which she has\r\ncome in contact. And a cultivated Englishman, with wealth and social\r\nposition at command, has been so attracted to them, that he has lavished\r\nboth his fortune and his best years in the work of their elevation. The\r\nsocial condition of the Dyaks has been sufficiently wretched. Subjected\r\nto the Malays, they have been forced to work in the mines without pay,\r\nwhile they were liable at any moment to be robbed of their homes, and\r\neven of their wives and children. \"We do not live like men,\" said one of\r\nthem, with great pathos. \"We are like monkeys, hunted from place to\r\nplace. We have no houses, and we dare not light a fire lest the smoke\r\ndraw our enemies upon us.\"\r\n\r\nRunning along the whole northern coast of Borneo, eight hundred miles,\r\nand inland perhaps two hundred, is found Borneo Proper, one of the three\r\ngreat Mohammedan kingdoms into which the island was divided as early as\r\nthe sixteenth century. This state is governed, or rather misgoverned, by\r\na sultan, and, under him, by rajahs and pangerans,--officials who give\r\nto the commands of their nominal superior but a scanty obedience. For\r\ntwo centuries Borneo Proper has been steadily settling into anarchy and\r\nbarbarism. With a government both feeble and despotic, it was torn by\r\nintestine wars, crushed within by oppression and ravaged without by\r\npiracy, until commerce and agriculture, the twin pillars of the state,\r\nwere equally threatened, and not one element of ruin seemed to be\r\nwanting. What evidence of decay could be more striking than the simple\r\nfact that Bruni, its capital, which in the sixteenth century was crowded\r\nwith a population of more than two hundred thousand souls, had in 1840\r\nscarcely fourteen thousand inhabitants?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo one corner of this wasting empire came, twenty-five years ago, a\r\nyoung Englishman. Simply a gentleman, he had no governmental alliances\r\nto help him, and no advantages of any sort for founding empire, except\r\nsuch as sprang from the possession of a sagacious mind, an undaunted\r\ntemper, and a heart thoroughly in sympathy with the oppressed. Alone he\r\nhas built up a flourishing state, introducing commercial activity and\r\nthe habits of civilized life where only oppression and misery were, and\r\nhas achieved an enterprise which seems to belong rather to the days of\r\nchivalry than to a plodding, utilitarian age,--an enterprise which, in\r\nromance and success, but not in carnage, calls to mind the deeds of the\r\ngreat Spanish captains in the New World.\r\n\r\nJames Brooke, the second and only surviving son of Thomas Brooke, a\r\ngentleman who had acquired a fortune in the service of the East India\r\nCompany, was born in India, April 29, 1803. At an early age he entered\r\nthe employ of the same company to whose interests his father had given\r\nhis best days. In 1826, as a cadet, he accompanied the British army to\r\nthe Burmese war, was dangerously wounded, received a furlough, and came\r\nto England. To restore his health and gratify his curiosity he spent the\r\nyear 1827 in travelling on the Continent. His furlough having nearly\r\nexpired, he embarked for India, but was wrecked on the voyage, and could\r\nnot report for duty in proper season. This was one of those apparently\r\nfortuitous circumstances which so often change the whole aspect of a\r\nman's life. At any rate, it was the turning-point in Mr. Brooke's\r\ncareer. Finding that his misfortune had cost him his position, and that\r\nhe could not recover it without tedious formalities, he left the\r\nservice. Uncontrolled master of himself, and endowed with sagacity and\r\ncourage of no ordinary stamp, he was ready for any undertaking which his\r\nadventurous spirit or his love of research might dictate. In fact, it\r\nwas during this interval of leisure that he embarked for China, and on\r\nhis passage saw for the first time the Eastern Archipelago. He was\r\npainfully interested in the condition of Borneo and Celebes, those great\r\nislands, sinking apparently into hopeless decay. His sympathies were\r\nawakened by the sufferings of the helpless natives, and his indignation\r\nwas aroused by the outrages of an unbridled piracy. His feelings can be\r\nbest gathered from his own language. \"These unhappy countries afford a\r\nstriking proof how the fairest and richest lands under the sun may\r\nbecome degraded by a continuous course of oppression and misrule. Whilst\r\nextravagant dreams of the progressive advancement of the human race are\r\nentertained, a large tract of the globe has been gradually relapsing\r\ninto barbarism. Whilst the folly of fashion requires an acquaintance\r\nwith the deserts of Africa, and a most ardent thirst for a knowledge of\r\nthe customs of Timbuctoo,--whilst the trumpet tongue of many an orator\r\nexcites thousands to the rational and charitable object of converting\r\nthe Jews or of reclaiming the Gypsies,--not a single prospectus is\r\nspread abroad, not a single voice is raised in Exeter Hall, to relieve\r\nthe darkness of this paganism and the horrors of this slave-trade. Under\r\nthese circumstances I have considered that individual exertions may be\r\nusefully applied to rouse the zeal of slumbering philanthropy.\"\r\n\r\nThe feelings thus awakened were not of a transient character. His dreams\r\nhenceforth were to visit these islands, see them for himself, study\r\ntheir natural history, understand their social condition, and ascertain\r\nwhat avenues could be opened for trade, and what steps taken to redeem\r\nthe oppressed native races.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1835 the death of his father, leaving him master of an independent\r\nfortune, enabled him to realize his dreams. He was a member of the Royal\r\nYacht Club, as well as owner and commander of a yacht,--a position which\r\nadmitted him in foreign ports to all the privileges of an English naval\r\nofficer. In this little vessel he resolved to undertake an adventurous\r\nvoyage of discovery. He approached his enterprise with a wary\r\nforethought. \"I was convinced,\" he says, \"that it was necessary to form\r\nmen to my purpose, and by a line of steady and kind conduct to raise up\r\na personal regard for myself and an attachment to the vessel.\" He\r\ncruised three years in the Mediterranean, carefully selecting and\r\ntraining his crew. He studied thoroughly the whole subject of the\r\nEastern Archipelago, and acquainted himself as perfectly as possible\r\nwith the minutiæ of seamanship and with every useful art. And when his\r\npreparations were all complete, on the 16th of December, 1838, he set\r\nsail for Singapore, in the yacht Royalist, a vessel of one hundred and\r\nforty-two tons, manned by twenty men and officers, with an armament of\r\nsix six-pounders and a full supply of small arms of all sorts. Such were\r\nthe mighty resources wherewith he began an enterprise which has ended in\r\nraising him to the government of a petty kingdom, and to almost\r\nsovereign influence over the whole empire of Borneo Proper.\r\n\r\nThe reader has already had glimpses of the feelings which prompted this\r\nexpedition. In a communication to the \"Geographical Register\" he more\r\nfully unfolds his views; and from this and from his familiar letters it\r\nis not difficult to gain a clear idea of the character and motives of\r\nthe man. That his ardent mind had been fired by a study of the career of\r\nhis great predecessor, Stamford Raffles, is evident. That he was himself\r\none of those energetic, restless natures, to which idleness or mere\r\nroutine-work is the severest of penalties, is equally evident. He had,\r\nmoreover, a large share of that kind of enthusiasm which the cool,\r\nsagacious men of this world call romance, and which delights to fasten\r\non objects seemingly impossible. He was like the old knights, rejoicing\r\nmost when the field of their devoir was distant and dangerous. Yet not\r\naltogether like them. He was rather a man of the twelfth century,\r\ndisciplined and invigorated by the hard common-sense and sharp\r\nutilitarianism of the nineteenth century. And we must not forget that he\r\nhonestly wished to benefit the native races. Every page, nay, almost\r\nevery line, in his journals and letters, bears witness to his profound\r\ncompassion for the despised and downtrodden Dyaks. Aside from this, when\r\nwe remember that he was a genuine Englishman, proud of his native land\r\nand thoughtful always of her aggrandizement, we need be at no loss to\r\nunderstand his motives. He went forth to gratify a love of adventure,\r\n\"to see something of the world and come back again,\" to extend a little\r\nthe realms of scientific knowledge, to suggest, perhaps, some plans for\r\nthe improvement of native character, and last, but not least, to learn\r\nwhether there might not be opened new avenues for the extension of\r\nBritish trade and British power.\r\n\r\nThat the methods by which these objects were to be attained were not\r\nvery well defined even to his own mind is clear. He himself said, \"I\r\ncast myself upon the waters, like Southey's little book; but whether the\r\nworld will know me after many days, is a question I cannot answer.\" And\r\nsome years after, alluding to a charge of inconsistency, he said, \"I did\r\nnot embrace my position _at once_; and indeed the position itself\r\naltered very rapidly; and I am free to confess before the world that my\r\nviews of duty and responsibility were not so high at first as they have\r\nsince been.\" Without doubt his direct and primary purpose was\r\ninvestigation. He took with him men of some scientific knowledge,\r\nhimself being no mean observer; and he proposed to prosecute, wherever\r\nopportunity occurred, researches into the geography, natural history,\r\nand commercial resources of these islands. If he had ulterior ends, as\r\nyet they existed in his mind as fascinating dreams, rather than\r\nwell-defined plans.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter a tedious voyage of nearly six months, the Royalist reached\r\nSingapore, June 1, 1839. While Mr. Brooke was engaged in refitting his\r\nyacht, and anxiously revolving in his mind how he should obtain\r\npermission to penetrate into the neighboring kingdom of Borneo, he\r\nlearned that Muda Hassim, uncle of the Sultan, and Rajah of Sarawak, the\r\nnorthwestern province of Borneo, had displayed great humanity towards a\r\ncrew of shipwrecked Englishmen. On receiving this information he started\r\nat once for Sarawak, hoping to get some hold upon the Rajah, and by such\r\nhelp to pursue his researches. But the time of his visit was most\r\nunfortunate. The whole province was in a state of open rebellion; so\r\nthat, while he was received courteously, and permitted to make some\r\nlocal surveys, nothing of importance could be accomplished. Baffled and\r\nwearied by delay, he sailed back to Singapore, and from thence to\r\nCelebes, where he remained several months, engaged in extensive\r\nexplorations, and in collecting specimens to illustrate the natural\r\nhistory of that island.\r\n\r\nMr. Brooke returned from Celebes worn out and sick, and was obliged to\r\nremain at Singapore several months to recruit his strength. In August,\r\n1840, he made a second visit to Sarawak, intending to tarry there a few\r\ndays, and then proceed homeward by the way of Manilla and China. \"I\r\nhave done fully as much as I promised the public,\" he writes. He found\r\nthings in much the same state as when he left. No progress had been made\r\nin the suppression of the rebellion. Few lives indeed had been lost, but\r\nthe most bloody war could hardly have produced worse results. The\r\ncountry was filled with combatants. Every straggler was cut off.\r\nViolence and rapine were the law. Trade and agriculture languished. A\r\nrich province was fast relapsing into a wilderness; and all its people\r\nwere beginning to suffer alike for shelter and sustenance. As our hero\r\nwas about to set sail, the Rajah opened his whole heart to him. His\r\nprospects were anything but flattering. He found himself unequal to the\r\nreduction of the rebels. He was surrounded by traitors. At the court of\r\nthe Sultan, a hostile cabal, taking advantage of his ill-fortune,\r\nthreatened his power and his life. In this strait, he besought his\r\nvisitor to remain and give him aid, promising in event of success to\r\nconfer upon him the government of the province. After a few days'\r\nreflection, Mr. Brooke, believing, as he declares, that the cause of the\r\nSultan was just, believing also that what the whole people needed most\r\nwas peace, and that peace would place him in a position to render them\r\nthe greatest service, acceded to this request, without, however, be it\r\nobserved, binding Muda Hassim to any precise stipulations concerning the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nMany pages of his journal are devoted to an account of this war; and a\r\nmost curious story it is of cowardice, bravado, and inefficiency. It was\r\nadvance and retreat, boastful challenge and as boastful reply, marching\r\nand countermarching, day after day, and month after month. \"Like the\r\nheroes of old, the adverse parties spoke to each other: 'We are coming,\r\nwe are coming; lay aside your muskets and fight us with your swords';\r\nand so the heroes ceased not to talk, but always forgot to fight\";--the\r\nsum of all their achievements being to lay waste the country, to\r\ninterrupt honest industry, and to put in peril the lives of the\r\nunoffending. Mr. Brooke soon tired of this farce. Gathering a motley\r\nforce, consisting of Malays, Dyaks, Chinese, and his own crew, he\r\nprepared for an assault. Then, planting his cannon where they commanded\r\nthe stronghold of the enemy, with a few well-directed volleys he brought\r\nits walls tumbling about their ears. The insurgents, driven to the open\r\ncountry, and altogether amazed by this specimen of Saxon energy,\r\nsurrendered at discretion. At one blow a desolating war was ended.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPeace being restored, Mr. Brooke did not insist on the literal\r\nfulfilment of the terms which Muda Hassim had in his extremity been so\r\nready to proffer. He chose to occupy a position of influence, rather\r\nthan one of outward authority. A contract was entered into by which he\r\nbecame Resident of Sarawak. The conditions of the agreement were, that\r\nthe Rajah on his part should repress piracy, protect legitimate\r\ncommerce, and as far as possible remove from the Dyaks unjust burdens;\r\nwhile his ally, in return for these concessions, should open trade,\r\nsending a vessel to and fro between Singapore and Sarawak, exchanging\r\nforeign luxuries for native products, and more especially for antimony,\r\nof which article the Rajah had the monopoly. In fulfilment of his part\r\nof the treaty, Mr. Brooke proceeded to Singapore, purchased a schooner,\r\nloaded her with an assorted cargo, returned to Sarawak, and at the\r\nearnest request of Muda Hassim landed and distributed his goods.\r\n\r\nBut auspicious as was the commencement of this alliance, soon grave\r\ncauses of complaint arose. On every point the deceitful Malay came short\r\nof his agreement. Having obtained valuable property, he showed no\r\nalacrity in paying for it; weeks and months passed without bringing him\r\napparently any nearer to a pecuniary settlement. So far from repressing\r\npiracy, he encouraged it; and a fleet of one hundred and twenty prahus,\r\nwith his tacit consent, actually put to sea. When a crew of English\r\nseamen were enslaved and carried to Bruni, under the most frivolous\r\npretexts he refused to intercede with the Sultan for these unfortunate\r\nmen. And so this strange friendship cooled. It was no slight proof\r\neither of his courage or his humanity to despatch at this very time, as\r\nMr. Brooke did, his yacht to Bruni, to attempt something in behalf of\r\nhis enslaved countrymen, and to remain himself with only three men at\r\nSarawak. The yacht came back, however, having effected nothing.\r\n\r\nBy this time the patience of the creditor was exhausted. Despoiled of\r\nhis goods, finding that, despite his remonstrances, the Dyaks were\r\ncruelly oppressed, and that piracy was encouraged, he resolved to try\r\nthe effect of threats. He repaired on board his yacht, loaded her guns\r\nwith grape and canister, and brought her broadside to bear upon the\r\nRajah's palace. Then taking a small, but well-armed guard, he sought an\r\ninterview with Muda Hassim. The terror of that functionary was extreme.\r\nThe native tribes openly sided with their English friend. The Chinese\r\nresidents remained obstinately neutral. The Malays, between cowardice\r\nand treachery, afforded him no efficient support. To crown all, his\r\nresolute and incensed ally had only to wave his hand to bring down upon\r\nhim swift destruction. \"After this demonstration, things went cheerily\r\nto a conclusion.\" Muda Hassim, finding that his creditor was inflexible,\r\nand being unable or unwilling to pay for the goods which he had\r\nfraudulently obtained, offered in payment of all debts to surrender the\r\ngovernment. The offer was accepted, the agreement drawn up, signed,\r\nsealed, guns fired and flags waved, and on September 24, 1841, Mr.\r\nBrooke became Rajah of Sarawak. In August of the following year the\r\nSultan solemnly confirmed the agreement.\r\n\r\nThe territory thus strangely passing into the hands of a private English\r\ngentleman was a tract of country bordering upon the sea sixty miles, and\r\nextending inland from seventy to eighty miles. Situated at the\r\nnortheastern extremity of Borneo, pierced by two small, but navigable\r\nrivers, its position is most favorable for commerce. Its soil is deep\r\nand rich, yielding under any proper culture large crops of all tropical\r\nproducts. Its forests are filled with trees fit for shipbuilding, and\r\nabound in that variety from which is obtained the gutta percha of\r\ncommerce. The hills are rich in iron and tin of the best quality. The\r\nmountain streams wash down gold. In the beds of smaller rivers are found\r\ndiamonds, in such profusion that most of the Malays wear them set in\r\nrings and other ornaments. From this single province comes nearly the\r\nwhole supply of antimony in the world. \"I do not believe,\" says a\r\nresident, \"that in the same given space there can be found so great\r\nmineral and vegetable wealth in any land in the whole world.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith what sentiments the new Rajah entered upon his duties can be best\r\nunderstood by a perusal of his familiar letters. He writes to his\r\nmother: \"Do not start when I say that I am going to settle in Borneo,\r\nthat I am about to endeavor to plant there a mixed colony amid a wild\r\nbut not unvirtuous race, and to become the pioneer of European knowledge\r\nand improvement. The diffusion of civilization, commerce, and religion\r\nthrough so vast an island as Borneo, I call a grand object,--so grand\r\nthat self is quite lost when I consider it; and even failure would be\r\nmuch better than the non-attempt.\" \"A few days ago I was up a high\r\nmountain and looked over the country. It is a prospect which I have\r\nrarely seen equalled; and sitting there, lazily smoking a cigar, I\r\ncalled into existence the coffee plantations, the sugar plantations, the\r\nnutmeg plantations, and pretty white villages and tiny steeples, and\r\ndreamed that I heard the buzz of life and the clang of industry amid the\r\njungles, and that the China Colins whistled as they went, for want of\r\nthought, as they homeward bent.\"\r\n\r\nThe first duty which claimed attention was the relief of the native\r\nDyaks. A shrewd Dyak once defined the Malay government as \"a plantain in\r\nthe mouth and a thorn in the back.\" A plantain giving to their poor\r\nsubjects a little to keep life in them; a thorn stripping them to the\r\nskin and piercing them to the bone. The description is pithy, and it is\r\ntrue. The exactions of the Malay chiefs were almost beyond belief.\r\nSeizing and monopolizing some article of prime necessity,--salt\r\nperhaps,--they would force the natives to buy at the rate of fifty\r\ndollars' worth of rice for a teacup of salt; until the wretched\r\ncultivator, who had raised a plentiful crop, was brought to the verge of\r\nstarvation. They reserved to themselves the right of purchasing the\r\narticles which the Dyaks had to sell, and then affixed to those articles\r\nan arbitrary price, perhaps less than a five-hundredth of their real\r\nvalue. They would send a bar of iron two or three feet long, and having\r\nan intrinsic worth of a few cents, to the head mart of a tribe,\r\ndemanding that his village should give for it a sum equal to five, ten,\r\nor twenty dollars. Another was sent in the same way, and another, and\r\nanother, until the rapacity of the chiefs was satisfied, or the wretched\r\nnatives had no more to give. Often, when the latter had been robbed of\r\neverything, the Malays would seize and sell their wives and children. It\r\nis recorded of one tribe, that there was not so much as one woman or\r\nchild to be found in it. All had been swept off by these remorseless\r\nslave-hunters. Nor did their wrongs end here. If a Dyak killed a Malay\r\n\"under any circumstances of aggression,\" he was put to death, often with\r\nevery possible addition of torture. If he accidentally injured one of\r\nthe ruling caste, he was fortunate to escape with the loss of half or\r\ntwo thirds of his little savings. On the other hand, a Malay might kill\r\nas many Dyaks as he pleased, and if perchance justice were a little\r\nsterner than usual, he might be fined a few cents or a few dollars.\r\nVolumes are contained in this one statement, that in the ten years from\r\n1830 to 1840, the Dyaks in the province of Sarawak dwindled from 14,000\r\nto 6,000 souls.\r\n\r\nA blow was immediately struck at the root of this black oppression. As\r\nsoon as the new government was fairly established, a few simple\r\nenactments were published. They declared that every man, Dyak as well as\r\nMalay, should enjoy unmolested all the gains of his toil; that all\r\nexactions of every name and nature should cease, and that only a small\r\ntax, evenly distributed, should be levied for the support of government;\r\nthat all roads and rivers should be free to all; that all molestation of\r\nthe Dyaks should be punished with severity. The proclamation which\r\ncontains these laws concludes with exhorting all persons who are\r\ndisposed to disturb the public peace to take flight speedily to some\r\nother country, where they can break with impunity the laws of God and\r\nman. These enactments were firmly executed, without fear and without\r\npartiality. Wonderful were the results! Internal violence ceased. The\r\nconfidence of the natives was awakened. Industry and enterprise sprang\r\nup on every hand as by magic. Sarawak became a city of refuge. Sometimes\r\nas many as fifty fled thither in a day. In 1844, in the short space of\r\ntwo months, five hundred families took shelter in the province. In 1850,\r\nthree thousand Chinese fled from Sambas to Sarawak. The Dyaks returned\r\nthe good-will of their Rajah with love and reverence. During one of his\r\ntours in the interior, delegations from tribes numbering six thousand\r\nsouls came to seek his protection. \"We have heard,\" said they, in simple\r\nbut touching language, \"that a son of Europe has arrived, who is a\r\nfriend of the Dyaks.\" When he visited the native hamlets, the women\r\nwould throw themselves on the ground and clasp his feet, and the whole\r\ntribe would spend the night in joyful feasting and merriment. It is\r\nsoberly affirmed by a credible witness, that on one occasion messengers\r\ncame fifteen days' journey from a distant province to see if there were\r\nsuch a phenomenon as Dyaks living in comfort.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Brooke soon found that all his efforts for internal reform must be\r\nin a comparative sense futile so long as piracy, that curse of Borneo,\r\nwas permitted to ravage unchecked. \"It is in a Malay's nature,\" says the\r\nDutch proverb, \"to rove on the seas in his prahu, as it is in that of\r\nthe Arab to wander with his steed on the sands of the desert.\" No person\r\nwho has not investigated the subject can appreciate how wide-spread and\r\ndeep-seated this plague of piracy is. The mere statistics are appalling.\r\nIt was estimated, in 1840, that one hundred thousand men made\r\nfreebooting their trade. One single chief had under control seven\r\nhundred prahus. Whole tribes, whole groups of islands, almost whole\r\nraces, despising even the semblance of honest industry, depended upon\r\nrapine for a livelihood. \"It is difficult to catch fish, but it is easy\r\nto catch Borneans,\" said the Soloo pirates scornfully; and, acting upon\r\nthat principle, they fitted out their fleets and planned their voyages\r\nwith all the method of honest tradesmen.\r\n\r\nThis piracy was divided into two branches,--coastwise piracy and piracy\r\non the broad seas. The Sea Dyaks built boats called bangkongs, sixty to\r\na hundred feet long, narrow and sharp, propelled by thirty to fifty\r\noars, and so swift that nothing but a steamer could overtake them. These\r\nfreebooters were the terror of all honest laborers and tradesmen.\r\nSkulking along the coast, pushing up rivers and creeks, landing anywhere\r\nand every where without warning, they mercilessly destroyed the native\r\nvillages and swept the inhabitants into captivity. Or else, impelling\r\nwith the force of fifty men their snaky craft, which were swift as\r\nrace-boats and noiseless as beasts of prey, they would surprise at dead\r\nof night some defenceless merchantman, overwhelm their victims with\r\nshowers of spears, and with morning light a plundered boat, a few dead\r\nbodies, were the silent witnesses of their ferocity. On the other hand,\r\nthe Illanum and Balanini tribes, infesting the islands to the northeast\r\nof Borneo, undertook far grander enterprises. Putting to sea, prepared\r\nfor a long voyage, in fleets of two or three hundred prahus, propelled\r\nby wind and oars, armed with brass cannon, and manned by ten thousand\r\nbold buccaneers, they swept through the whole length of the Chinese Sea,\r\nand, turning the southernmost point of Borneo, penetrated the straits\r\nand sounds between Java and Celebes, never stopping in their ruthless\r\ncourse until they came face to face with the sturdy pirates of New\r\nGuinea, and returned, after a voyage of ten thousand miles and an\r\nabsence of two years, laden with spoils and captives. How hapless was\r\nthe fate of the poor Dyak! If he stayed at home, cultivating his fields,\r\nhis Malay lord fleeced him to the skin. If, thinking to engage in\r\ngainful traffic, he hugged the shore with his little bark, the\r\nriver-pirate snatched him up. If he stood out upon the broad waters, he\r\ncould scarcely hope to escape the Northern hordes who swarmed in every\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nMr. Brooke's most terrible assailants were the Sakarran and Sarebus\r\npirates, two tribes of freebooters whose seats of power were on the\r\nSarebus and Batang Lupar rivers, two streams fifty or sixty miles east\r\nof Sarawak. These tribes were encouraged and secretly helped by his own\r\nMalay chiefs, and insolently defied his power, continuing their\r\ndepredations, capturing every vessel which ventured out, and ravaging\r\nall the adjacent coasts. The strength of these confederacies was so\r\ngreat, that it was no unusual thing for them to muster a hundred\r\nwar-boats; and they had built, on the banks of the rivers which they\r\ninfested, strong forts at every point which commanded the channel. That\r\nthe new Rajah was not able with his slender resources to curb these\r\nsea-robbers is not surprising. The only wonder is, that he was able to\r\nprotect his own capital from the assaults which they often threatened\r\nbut never dared to attempt.\r\n\r\nBut efficient aid was at hand. In the summer of 1843 the British ship\r\nDido anchored off the entrance of Sarawak River. She was commissioned to\r\nsuppress piracy in and about the Chinese Sea. Her commander readily\r\nentered into the views of the English Rajah. A boat expedition against\r\nthe strongholds of the Sarebus pirates was projected. Mr. Brooke\r\nassisted with seven hundred Dyaks. A curious incident occurred, showing\r\nhow clearly the natives appreciated their dependence on their English\r\nfriend. When he asked their chiefs if they would aid him, they besought\r\nhim not to risk his life in so desperate an enterprise. But when he\r\nassured them that his purpose was fixed, that he should go, alone if\r\nnecessary, they replied: \"What is the use of our remaining behind? You\r\ndie, we die; you live, we live. We will go too.\" The expedition was\r\nperfectly successful. Three fortified villages were stormed, many guns\r\nspiked, many boats destroyed, and their defenders driven to the jungles.\r\nThis chastisement not sufficing, in the following year another\r\nexpedition from the same vessel attacked the Sakarran pirates and\r\ninflicted upon them a punishment even more severe than that which had\r\nfallen to the lot of their Sarebus brethren. Six forts, one mounting\r\nfifty-six guns, scores of war-boats, and more than a thousand huts, were\r\nburned. These lessons, though sharp, did not permanently subdue.\r\n\r\nThe blow which broke the power of these confederacies was inflicted in\r\n1849. News came to Sarawak that the pirates had put to sea, marking\r\ntheir course by fearful atrocities. At once Mr. Brooke applied to the\r\nEnglish Admiral for assistance, and the steamer Nemesis was despatched\r\nto the scene of action. The Rajah joined her with eighteen war-boats, to\r\nwhich were afterwards added eleven hundred Dyaks, in their bangkongs. On\r\nthe 31st of July, at night, they encountered the great war-fleet of the\r\nSarebus and Sakarran pirates, numbering one hundred and fifty bangkongs,\r\nreturning home laden with plunder. The pirates found the entrances of\r\nthe river occupied by their enemies,--the English, Malay, and Dyak\r\nforces being placed in three detachments, while the Nemesis was fully\r\nprepared to assist whenever the attack should begin. \"Then there was a\r\ndead silence, broken only by three strokes of a gong, which called the\r\npirates to a council of war. A few minutes afterwards a fearful yell\r\ngave notice of their advance, and the fleet approached in two divisions.\r\nIn the dead of the night there ensued a terrible scene. The pirates\r\nfought bravely, but they could not withstand the superior forces of\r\ntheir enemy. Their boats were upset by the paddles of the steamer. They\r\nwere hemmed in on every side, and five hundred men were killed sword in\r\nhand, while twenty-five hundred escaped to the jungles, many of them to\r\nperish. The morning light showed a sad spectacle of ruin and defeat.\r\nUpwards of eighty prahus and bangkongs were captured, and many more\r\ndestroyed.\" The English officers would have gladly saved life; but the\r\npirates would take no quarter, and the prisoners were few. It was a\r\nstriking fact, that one of the war-boats under Mr. Brooke was manned by\r\nsome thirty Malays, every one of whom had lost during the year a near\r\nrelative, killed by these same pirates. The confederacy has never risen\r\nfrom this defeat, and for years the tribes composing it have returned to\r\nthe labors of peaceful life. Writing twelve months afterwards to a\r\nfriend, Rajah Brooke says: \"Pray keep the 31st of July apart for a\r\nspecial bumper, for during the last year not a single innocent life has\r\nbeen taken by these pirates, nor a single prahu fallen into their\r\nhands.\" Many a victory, famous in story, has accomplished less.\r\n\r\nThe next year a fleet of sixty-four prahus, manned by northern pirates,\r\nand carrying 1224 guns, was destroyed by British gunboats in the Gulf of\r\nTonquin. This was followed by an attack of the Spaniards upon the haunts\r\nof the Soloo pirates. A lull ensued. For three or four years almost\r\nnothing was heard of freebooting; but it was a deceitful calm, not a\r\nfinal cessation of the storm. The freebooting spirit was not taken out\r\nof the blood of the Malay. Now piracy is said to be on the increase\r\nagain. Only three years since six Balanini pirates had the audacity to\r\nsail into Sarawak Bay and commence depredations along its coasts. But\r\nnot one returned to tell the tale. The whole six were captured or\r\ndestroyed, and their crews killed or taken prisoners. The only permanent\r\nremedy for the evil is just, settled, and efficient government, such as\r\nhas been established at Sarawak, destroying not simply the fleets, but\r\nbreaking up the piratical haunts, and with firm hand forcing their\r\npeople back into the habits and pursuits of civilized life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBeing delivered for a time at least from these perils, the new Rajah was\r\nat liberty to devote himself to the welfare of his subjects. It is not\r\npossible, in a brief notice, even to hint at all the events and efforts\r\nof the next fifteen years of his government,--to say how he repressed\r\nthe cupidity and lawlessness of the Malay chiefs; how he encouraged and\r\nprotected the poor Dyaks; how he opened new channels for trade; how,\r\nfrom year to year, he resisted the fierce pirates, who, coming from the\r\nneighboring islands with strong fleets, sought to sweep the adjacent\r\nseas. Of course the prime need was to restore confidence, and to assure\r\nto all honest workers, of every race, the gains of their industry. The\r\nfirst question, indeed, of the Chinese emigrant was, \"Will you protect\r\nus, or will our plantations, so soon as they are worth anything, be\r\nstripped by your chiefs?\" It has been beautiful to behold order coming\r\nout of chaos, peace out of violence, whole districts redeemed from\r\nanarchy, simply by giving efficient support to the orderly part of the\r\npopulation. Another object of not less importance was to create in this\r\npeople something of the feeling of nationality, and to make them\r\ncomprehend that they were citizens, with the duties of citizens. It\r\ncertainly was no easy task to awaken much of the sentiment of lofty\r\npatriotism in the minds of those whose only common memories were of\r\nlawless misrule and oppression. Every possible effort has been made in\r\nthis direction. The struggle has been, not to plant an English colony,\r\nbut to create a Bornean state. The laws are not English, nor built upon\r\nEnglish precedents. They are simply the old Bornean statutes, made\r\nconformable to the principles of equity, and administered with just\r\nregard to the customs and traditions of the people. The offices of\r\ngovernment are filled to the least possible degree with foreigners;\r\nwhile native chiefs and even reclaimed pirates are associated with them,\r\nand thus habituated to all the forms of a civilized state. Mr. Brooke,\r\nwith a rare courage and wisdom, has always trusted for his safety to the\r\ngood-will of his native subjects. He has never been sustained by\r\nmercenary bands. At a time when piratical violence was most threatening,\r\nwhen disorders were yet rife in his own state, and when his subjects but\r\npoorly appreciated his benevolent purposes towards them, his whole\r\nEnglish force was twenty-four men. It is pleasant to add, that this\r\nconfidence was not misplaced. A younger generation is now springing up,\r\nwith larger views of life, and with a better appreciation of the\r\nworkings and value of equitable government. To sum up all in a brief\r\nsentence, it may be said with truth that the administration has been\r\nmarked by rare sagacity, firmness, and comprehensiveness of view, and\r\nthat it has been crowned with success.\r\n\r\nIn 1845, Mr. Brooke came for the first time into official relations\r\nwith the British government, by accepting the office of confidential\r\nagent in Borneo. We have already alluded to his warm love of his native\r\ncountry. As early as 1841, he had expressed a willingness to sacrifice\r\nhis large outlays, and to relinquish all his rights and interests to the\r\ncrown, if a guaranty could be given that piracy would be checked and the\r\nnative races protected in all their proper rights and privileges. He\r\naccepted gladly, therefore, a post which promised to increase his power\r\nto benefit his people, and entered upon its duties with vigor.\r\nImmediately upon his appointment, he was requested to make\r\ninvestigations as to the existence of a harbor fit for the shelter and\r\nvictualling of ships bound from Hong-Kong to Singapore. He reported that\r\nLabuan, a small island north of Borneo, was in every way suitable; that\r\nit was about equidistant from the two parts; that it had a fine harbor,\r\nor rather roadstead; that it was healthy; that it abounded in coal of\r\nthe best quality; that, finally, the Sultan stood pledged to convey it\r\nupon reasonable terms.\r\n\r\nBut before legal papers could be drawn, the whole policy of the court of\r\nBruni had changed. The Sultan was a monarch with \"the head of an idiot\r\nand the heart of a pirate.\" All his sympathies were with violence and\r\nrobbery. Under the influence of others, he had agreed to use his power\r\nagainst piracy, and had even been brought to say, in fawning phrase,\r\nthat \"he wanted the English near to him.\" But he suddenly repented of\r\nhis good purposes. In a fit of Oriental fickleness he caused Muda Hassim\r\nand all who favored the English alliance to be put to death, despatched\r\na messenger secretly to administer poison to Mr. Brooke, and entered\r\ninto even closer friendship than before with the piratical tribes. A\r\nconfidential servant of Pangeran Budrudeen, the brother of Muda Hassim,\r\nwith difficulty escaped, and fled to Sarawak. He related that his master\r\nhad bravely resisted, but, overpowered by numbers and desperately\r\nwounded, had committed to his charge a ring, bidding him deliver it to\r\nRajah Brooke as a dying memento, and to tell him that he died faithful\r\nto his pledges to the Queen; then, setting fire to a keg of powder, he\r\nblew himself with his family into the air.\r\n\r\nThese tidings filled Mr. Brooke with grief and indignation. Every\r\npassion of his fiery and energetic nature was aroused. He repaired on\r\nboard the British fleet, which, upon receipt of this news, had put into\r\nSarawak. Without delay the fleet sailed for Bruni. An immediate\r\nexplanation was demanded of the Sultan. The reply was a volley from the\r\nforts which commanded the river. Without ceremony the ships returned the\r\nfire. In a brief time these strongholds were stormed, and Bruni itself\r\nwas at the mercy of the enemy. The Sultan fled to the swamps. Sailing\r\nout of Borneo River, the fleet swept along the whole northern coast,\r\ntaking in rapid succession the forts of the Illanum pirates who had\r\ninstigated the murders at Bruni, and inflicting upon them a signal\r\nchastisement.\r\n\r\nBy this time the Sultan wearied of jungles and sighed for his palace. He\r\nwrote a cringing letter, promising amendment, agreeing to ratify all his\r\nformer engagements, and as a sign of his true penitence was ready even\r\nto pay royal honors to the memory of the men whom he had slain. There\r\nwas no further difficulty in respect to the cession of Labuan, and it\r\nwas taken possession of December 24, 1846,--Mr. Brooke being appointed\r\ngovernor. It is said that the possession of this island goes far to make\r\nEngland mistress of the Chinese Sea,--a statement easily to be credited\r\nby any one conversant with English policy. At any rate, he who observes\r\nhow, at apparently insignificant stations,--on little islands, on a\r\nmarshy peninsula,--mere dots on the map,--England has established her\r\ncommercial depots,--at Hong-Kong in the north, at Labuan in the centre,\r\nand at Singapore in the south,--will gain new respect for the sagacity\r\nwhich in the councils of the mother country always lurks behind the\r\nred-tapism of which we hear so much.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter an absence of nine years, Rajah Brooke revisited England in the\r\nyear 1847. He was the hero of the hour. Every honor was showered upon\r\nhim. He was invited to visit Windsor Castle, received the freedom of\r\nLondon, and then or soon after was knighted. Owing to his\r\nrepresentations of the readiness of the Dyaks to receive instruction, a\r\nmeeting was held in London, at which funds were obtained to build a\r\nchurch and school-houses. Two missionaries and their families were sent\r\nto Sarawak. The buildings were erected long since, and these Christian\r\nmeans are in full activity. Brooke's language upon the proper\r\nqualifications of a missionary exhibits in a striking light his\r\nstraightforward resolution and enlarged liberality. \"Above all things, I\r\nbeg of you to save us from such a one as some of the committee desire to\r\nsee at Sarawak. Zealots, and intolerants, and enthusiasts, who begin the\r\ntask of tuition by a torrent of abuse against all that their pupils hold\r\nsacred, shall not come to Sarawak. Whilst our endeavors to convert the\r\nnatives are conducted with charity, I am a warm friend of the mission.\r\nBut whenever there is a departure from the only visible means God has\r\nplaced at our disposal,--time, reason, patience,--and the Christian\r\nfaith is to be heralded in its introduction by disturbances and\r\nheart-burnings and bloodshed, I want it not; and you are quite at\r\nliberty to say, that I would rather that the mission were withdrawn.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1850, Mr. Brooke became the object of a virulent attack,\r\ncontinued several years, both in the public prints and in Parliament.\r\nPrompted originally by the petty malice of those whose tool for the\r\nadvancement of their personal schemes he had refused to become, this\r\nattack was taken up by a few persons of influence, who seem to have\r\nmisunderstood utterly both his character and work. He has been termed a\r\nmere adventurer. He has been accused of avarice, of wringing from the\r\nnatives great sums, and receiving from England large salaries as Consul\r\nat Borneo and as Governor of Labuan. It has been asserted that he has\r\nbeen guilty of wholesale slaughter of the innocent, interfering with\r\ntribal wars under the pretence of extirpating piracy. None of these\r\ncharges have been sustained. On the contrary, it has been conclusively\r\nshown that he has sunk more than £20,000 of his private fortune in this\r\nenterprise. The piracy, so mildly called intertribal war, is undoubtedly\r\nrobbery, both on the sea and on the land, and conducted with all fitting\r\naccompaniments of cruelty and bloodshed. This persecution has not been\r\nborne by its object with much patience, and, indeed, like Rob Roy's\r\nHighlander, \"he does not seem to be famous for that gude gift.\" \"I am no\r\ntame lion to be cowed by a pack of hounds. These intertribal wars are\r\nsuch as the wolf wages against the lamb. I should like to ask the most\r\npeaceable man in England what he would do if a horde of bandits\r\nfrequently burst forth from Brest and Cherbourg, ravaging the shores of\r\nthe Channel, and carrying women and children into captivity, with the\r\nheads of their decapitated husbands and fathers? Would he preach? Would\r\nhe preach when he saw his daughter dishonored and his son murdered? And\r\nthen would he proclaim his shame and cowardice among men? What do some\r\ngentlemen expect? They particularly desire to suppress piracy. Do they\r\nreally imagine that piracy is to be suppressed by argument and\r\npreaching?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Brooke's enemies have three times pressed their accusations before\r\nthe House of Commons, and three times have been defeated by overwhelming\r\nmajorities,--the last vote being 230 to 19. Finally, to end the\r\ncontroversy, a royal commission was appointed to visit the scene of\r\nthese transactions, and upon the spot to decide their merits. The report\r\nof this commission has not reached us, if indeed it has ever been made\r\npublic; but the practical results of it are certain. Mr. Brooke has\r\nsevered his official connection with the British government by a\r\nresignation of the offices which he held under it; while he retains his\r\nsovereignty at Sarawak, with the undiminished love of his subjects and\r\nan unimpaired influence over the native tribes. There seems to be no\r\ndoubt that the intelligent public opinion of England fully sustains him.\r\nAnd it is safe to predict that with that opinion the final verdict of\r\nhistory will coincide. That, placed in circumstances of great\r\ndifficulty, he may have taken steps not to be squared with the nicest\r\nmorality, is possible; for that is what must be said of every man who\r\nhas borne the burden of great public responsibility. Neither is it\r\nsurprising that a man of such boldness of speech and such almost\r\nCromwellian vigor in action should have enemies; that is a necessity.\r\nBut that he has been a true and sagacious friend of the natives, and\r\nthat his career has been for the increase of human happiness, are facts\r\nas certain as any can be.\r\n\r\nHis best defence is his works. In 1842, when he took the government of\r\nSarawak, it was a feeble province, torn by dissension, crushed by\r\nslavery, and ravaged by lawless violence. Now it is a peaceful,\r\nprosperous commonwealth. In 1842, its capital, Kuching, was a wretched\r\nvillage, whose houses were miserable mud huts or tents of leaves, and\r\ncontaining but fifteen hundred inhabitants. Now it numbers fifteen\r\nthousand,--an increase almost rivalling that of our Western cities. In\r\n1842, no boat put to sea without terror. As a result, the amount of\r\ntrade was contemptible. Now Sarawak has enterprising native merchants,\r\nowning vessels of two hundred tons, having regular transactions with\r\nSingapore and all the neighboring ports. This trade, as early as 1853,\r\nemployed twenty-five thousand tons of shipping, and the exports for the\r\nyear were valued at more than a million of dollars. In 1842, deaths by\r\nviolence were of almost daily occurrence. Twelve years later, a resident\r\ncould boast that for three years only one person had lost his life by\r\nother than natural causes. How would American cities appear in\r\ncomparison with this poor Dyak and heathen metropolis? Well does Rajah\r\nBrooke proudly ask, \"Could such success spring from a narrow and sordid\r\npolicy?\" Mrs. McDougall, the missionary's wife, says: \"We have now a\r\nbeautiful church at Sarawak, and the bell calls us there to worship\r\nevery morning at six, and at five every evening. Neither is there\r\nanything in this quiet, happy place to prevent our thus living in God's\r\npresence.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. McDougall adds a story which shows the estimation in which the\r\nnatives hold their Rajah. \"Pa Jenna paid me a visit at Sarawak. The\r\nRajah was then in England. But Pa Jenna, coming into my sitting-room,\r\nimmediately espied his picture hanging against the wall. I was much\r\nstruck with the expression of respect which both the face and attitude\r\nof this untutored savage assumed as he stood before the picture. He\r\nraised his handkerchief from his head, and, saluting the picture with a\r\nbow, such as a Roman Catholic would make to his patron saint's altar,\r\nwhispered to himself, 'Our great Rajah.'\" And this man was a reclaimed\r\npirate.\r\n\r\nThis reverential love of the natives is the one thing which does not\r\nadmit of a doubt. The proofs are constant and irresistible. Some years\r\nsince a lady with a few attendants was pushing her boat up a Bornean\r\nriver, many leagues away from Sarawak, when she encountered a wild Dyak\r\ntribe on a warlike expedition. The sight of more than a hundred\r\nhalf-naked savages, crowning a little knoll which jutted into the river\r\na half-dozen rods in advance of her boat, dancing frantically like\r\nmaniacs, brandishing their long knives, and yelling all the while like\r\ndemons, was not cheering. Yet at the sight of the Sarawak flag raised at\r\nthe bow of the boat, every demonstration of hostility ceased. She was\r\noverpowered by their noisy welcome, and received from them the kindest\r\nattention. A dozen years ago, at the very time that the accusations of\r\ncruelty and wholesale slaughter of innocent people were most recklessly\r\nmade, a party of Englishmen, and among them the adopted son of the\r\nRajah, went on an exploring expedition to the extreme northeast corner\r\nof Borneo, more than six hundred miles from Sarawak. While they were\r\nseated one evening around their fire, the whole air resounded with the\r\ncries, \"Tuan Brooke! Tuan Brooke!\" and presently the natives drew near\r\nand expressed their joy at seeing a son of the great Rajah, and\r\nwondering that he who had so blessed the southern Dyaks did not extend\r\nhis protection to their northern brethren. One anecdote more. During the\r\nChinese insurrection, of which we shall soon speak, a Malay chief,\r\nfighting desperately against the insurgents, was mortally wounded, only\r\nlingering long enough to be assured of the Rajah's victory, and to\r\nexclaim with his dying breath, \"I would rather be in hell with the\r\nEnglish, than in heaven with my own countrymen.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe loyalty of the native population was thoroughly tested in the year\r\n1857. It was the time of the second British war against China. Now the\r\nChinese are in one sense the most cosmopolitan of races. Wherever bread\r\nis to be won, or gold amassed, there they go, thus becoming scattered\r\nall through Southeastern Asia and the adjoining islands. In one aspect\r\nthey are a great blessing. They are a most laborious and thrifty race,\r\nof almost incalculable benefit in the development of the material\r\nresources of a country. But in some respects they are also an element of\r\ndanger. They never identify themselves with the country in which they\r\ndwell. They simply come to get a living out of it. They band themselves\r\nin secret societies or other exclusive organizations, and seem to get no\r\nreal love for the land which gives them bread, or the people among whom\r\nthey live. Under a peaceful rule, this race had greatly multiplied at\r\nSarawak. Some branches of industry had indeed almost fallen into their\r\nhands. Especially in all mining operations was their help a positive\r\nnecessity. For the Dyak, though industrious enough on his little\r\nplantation, will not work, except on compulsion, in the mines. These\r\nplaces are bitter to him with the memory of forced labor and unrequited\r\nmisery. Besides, he believes that the bowels of the earth are filled\r\nwith demons, and no amount of pay gives him courage to face these. As a\r\nresult, the conduct of the mines was left to the Chinese, and they were\r\nunwisely permitted to work them in large companies of several hundred,\r\nunder their own overseers. This gave them the advantages of a compact\r\norganization: to a dangerous degree they became a state within the\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nWhen the war in China broke out, the Chinese residents at Sarawak,\r\nsympathizing with their countrymen, were naturally greatly excited; and\r\nwhen tidings came that the English fleet had been repulsed from before\r\nthe Canton forts, they were emboldened to take the desperate step of\r\nattempting to put to death or to drive out of the country Rajah Brooke\r\nand the rest of the English people, that they themselves might take\r\npossession of it. About dusk on a February night, six hundred of them\r\ngathered under their chiefs, armed themselves, went on board\r\ncargo-boats, and began to float down the river towards the capital. At\r\nmidnight they attacked the Rajah's house. Its inmates were forced to\r\nflee to the jungles. The Rajah rose from a sick-bed, ran to the banks of\r\nthe stream, dove under one of the Chinese boats, swam the river, and\r\ntook refuge with the Malays. Several of his countrymen were murdered.\r\nHis own house, filled with the priceless collections of a lifetime,\r\ntogether with a costly library, was burned.\r\n\r\nIt was a gloomy morning which succeeded the night of this catastrophe.\r\nThough he did not doubt for a moment the ultimate suppression of the\r\nrebellion, what ruin might not be wrought in the few days or weeks which\r\nshould elapse before that event! And where, now that he had been driven\r\nfrom his capital, he should find a base of operations to which he might\r\ngather the scattered native forces, was the perplexing question of the\r\nhour,--when, joyful sight, he beheld a merchant steamer sailing up the\r\nriver! He hailed her, went on board, and with a sufficient force steamed\r\nup to Sarawak. With his appearance the last vestige of hope for the\r\ninsurrection disappeared.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile stirring events had taken place. At first the natives were\r\nstunned. They were roused at dead of night, to find the Chinese in\r\npossession of the town, their Rajah's house in flames, the Rajah\r\nmissing, while the rumor was that he had been killed. For a time they\r\nwandered about listlessly, vacantly staring each other in the face, and\r\nit seemed as though they were about to submit without a struggle. In the\r\nmidst of this gloom and uncertainty, up spoke a Malay trader, whose\r\nveins, despite his peaceful occupation, were full of the old pirate\r\nblood: \"Are we going to submit to be governed by these Chinese, or are\r\nwe going to be faithful to our Rajah? I am no talker, but I will never\r\nbe governed by any but him, and to-night I commence war to the knife\r\nwith his enemies.\" This broke the spell. Both Malays and Dyaks, in city\r\nand country alike, rose _en masse_, and after a severe fight, prolonged\r\ntill the reappearance of Mr. Brooke, drove the Chinese to the forests,\r\nand pursued them with unrelenting fury. Many of the insurgents perished\r\nby the sword. Many more wandered about till they died of starvation.\r\nSome threw themselves down in their tracks, expiring from fatigue and\r\nutter wretchedness. Some hung themselves to escape their misery. In\r\ndespair and exasperation, they even turned their arms against each\r\nother. Of the six hundred who made the original attack, sixty escaped.\r\nOf the four thousand who composed the Chinese population, a forlorn and\r\nwearied remnant of two thousand took refuge in the Dutch part of the\r\nisland. This lamentable destruction was the result neither of the order\r\nnor the permission of the Rajah. It was accomplished by the unreasoning\r\nfury of an outraged people. In a few days the formidable insurrection\r\nwas ended. The places of the insurgents were filled as rapidly as they\r\nhad been vacated. Scarcely a trace was left of the ravages of the\r\nrebellion; and it accomplished nothing, save to convince all doubters\r\nthat the government of the province rested, as all stable government\r\nmust rest, on the good-will of the subject.\r\n\r\nAt the height of the insurrection a striking incident occurred. While\r\ntheir brethren were being hurled in utter confusion across the Dutch\r\nborders, several hundred Chinese fled from those very Dutch territories\r\nand sought refuge in Sarawak. Though harassed by care, the Rajah did not\r\nneglect their appeal, but sent trustworthy men, who piloted them safely\r\nthrough the incensed Dyaks, who on their part by no means appreciated\r\nthe virtue of such a step, but thought rather that every man \"who wore a\r\ntail\" ought to be put to death, though they bowed to the better judgment\r\nof their chief.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe latest accounts represent the province as continuing in a state of\r\nunabated prosperity. Its bounds, by more recent cessions, have been so\r\nlargely increased, that its shore line is now three hundred miles long,\r\nand the whole population of the state two hundred and fifty thousand.\r\nThe haunts of the Sarebus and Sakarran pirates are included in the new\r\nlimits; and these once-dreaded freebooters have learned the habits of\r\nhonest industry. Indeed, during the days of the insurrection the state\r\nfound no more faithful or courageous defenders than they, although their\r\nold corsair blood was visible in the relentless tenacity with which they\r\ntracked the flying foe. Sir James Brooke, with increasing years, has\r\nretired somewhat from the active care of the government, leaving the\r\nconduct of affairs very much to his nephew, Captain Brooke, whom he has\r\ndesignated as his heir and successor, and who is represented as being\r\nalso heir in a large degree to his uncle's principles, courage, and\r\nsagacity.\r\n\r\nRajah Brooke sought persistently for many years to give perpetuity to\r\nhis life's work by placing Sarawak under British protection. He made\r\nrepeated offers to surrender to the Queen all right and title which he\r\nhad acquired, on any terms which would secure the welfare of the\r\nnatives. But these offers have been definitely rejected; the seeming\r\nprotection which Sarawak enjoyed through the position of its ruler as\r\nGovernor of Labuan has been withdrawn, and the little state left to work\r\nout unaided its destiny. What shall be the final fate of this\r\ninteresting experiment, whether there shall arise successors to the\r\nfounder wise enough to maintain the government so bravely established,\r\nor whether the infant state shall perish with the man who called it into\r\nexistence, and become only a memory, it is impossible to foretell; but,\r\nliving or dead, its annals will always be a noble monument to him whose\r\nforce of character and undaunted persistency created it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe earlier portraits we have of Rajah Brooke depict him as a man of a\r\npeculiarly frank, open, and pleasing exterior, yet with a countenance\r\nmarked by intelligence, thought, and energy; but underneath all a\r\ncertain dreaminess of expression, found often in the faces of those born\r\nfor adventure and to seek for the enterprise of their age fresh fields,\r\nnew El Dorados hidden in strange lands and unfamiliar seas.\r\n\r\nThe later portraits give us a face, plain, sagacious, yet full of an\r\nexpression of kindly benevolence. The exigencies of a busy life have\r\ntransformed romance into reality and common-sense; the adventurer and\r\nknight-errant has but obeyed the law of his age, and become a noble\r\nexample of the power of the Anglo-Saxon mind to organize in the face of\r\nadverse circumstances a state, and to construct out of most unpromising\r\nelements the good fabric of orderly social life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPASSAGES FROM HAWTHORNE'S NOTE-BOOKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\n_March_, 1845.--Nature sometimes displays a little tenderness for our\r\nvanity, but is never careful for our pride.

The river\r\nhere makes a bend, nearly at a right angle. On the opposite side, a high\r\nbank descends precipitately to the water; a few apple-trees are\r\nscattered along the declivity. A small cottage, with a barn, peeps over\r\nthe top of the bank; and at its foot, with their roots in the water, is\r\na picturesque clump of several maple-trees, their trunks all in a\r\ncluster, and their tops forming a united mass of new fast-budding\r\nfoliage. At the foot of this clump of trees lies a boat, half in the\r\nwater, half drawn up on the bank. A tract of flags and water-weeds\r\nextends along the base of the bank, outside of which, at a late period,\r\nwill grow the flat, broad leaves of the yellow water-lily, and the\r\npond-lily. A southwestern breeze is ruffling the river, and drives the\r\nlittle wavelets in the same direction as the current. Most of the course\r\nof the river in this vicinity is through marshy and meadowy ground, as\r\nyet scarcely redeemed from the spring-time overflow, and which at all\r\nseasons is plashy and unfit for walking. At my feet the water overbrims\r\nthe shore, and kisses the new green grass, which sprouts even beneath\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe Promontory of Columbines rises rugged and rocky from amidst\r\nsurrounding lowlands, (in a field next to that where the monument is\r\nerected, near the Old Manse,) and it forms the forth-putting angle at\r\nthe bend of the river. In earlier spring the river embraces it all\r\nround, and converts it into an island. Rocks, with flakes of dry moss\r\ncovering them, peep out everywhere; and abundant columbines grow in the\r\ninterstices of these rocks, and wherever else the soil is scanty and\r\ndifficult enough to suit their fancy,--avoiding the smoother and better\r\nsites, which they might just as well have chosen, close at hand. They\r\nare earlier on this spot than anywhere else, and are therefore doubly\r\nvaluable, though not nearly so large, nor of so rich a scarlet and gold,\r\nas some that we shall gather from the eastern slope of a hill, two or\r\nthree weeks hence. The promontory is exposed to all winds, and there\r\nseems no reason why it should produce the earliest flowers, unless that\r\nthis is a peculiar race of columbines, which has the precious gift of\r\nearlier birth assigned to them in lieu of rich beauty. This is the first\r\nday of the present spring that I have found any quite blown; but last\r\nyear, I believe, they came considerably earlier. Here and there appeared\r\na blue violet, nestling close to the ground, pretty, but inconvenient to\r\ngather and carry home, on account of its short stalk. Houstonias are\r\nscattered about by handfuls. Anemones have been in bloom for several\r\ndays on the edge of the woods, but none ever grow on the Promontory of\r\nColumbines.\r\n\r\nThe grass is a glad green in spots; but this verdure is very partial,\r\nand over the general extent the old, withered stalks of last year's\r\ngrass are found to predominate. The verdure appears rich, between the\r\nbeholder and the sun; in the opposite direction, it is much less so. Old\r\nmullein-stalks rise tall and desolate, and cling tenaciously to the soil\r\nwhen we try to uproot them. The promontory is broken into two or three\r\nheads. Its only shadow is from a moderately-sized elm, which, from year\r\nto year, has flung down its dead branches, all within its circumference,\r\nwhere they lie in various stages of decay. There are likewise rotten and\r\ncharred stumps of several other trees.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe fence of our avenue is covered with moss on the side fronting\r\ntowards the north, while the opposite side is quite free from it,--the\r\nreason being, that there is never any sunshine on the north side to dry\r\nthe moisture caused by rains from the northeast. The moss is very\r\nluxuriant, sprouting from the half-decayed wood, and clinging to it as\r\nif partially incorporated therewith.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTowards the dimness of evening a half-length figure appearing at a\r\nwindow,--the blackness of the background, and the light upon the face,\r\ncause it to appear like a Rembrandt picture.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the top of Wachusett, butterflies, large and splendid; also bees in\r\nconsiderable numbers, sucking honey from the alpine flowers. There is a\r\ncertain flower, a species of Potentilla, I think, which is found on\r\nmountains at a certain elevation, and inhabits a belt, being found\r\nneither above nor below it. On the highest top of Wachusett there is a\r\ncircular foundation, built evidently with great labor, of large, rough\r\nstones, and rising perhaps fifteen feet. On this basis formerly rose a\r\nwooden tower, the fragments of which, a few of the timbers, now lie\r\nscattered about. The immediate summit of the mountain is nearly bare and\r\nrocky, although interspersed with bushes; but at a very short distance\r\nbelow there are trees, though slender, forming a tangled confusion, and\r\namong them grows the wild honeysuckle pretty abundantly, which was in\r\nbloom when we were there (Sunday, June 17th). A flight of rude stone\r\nsteps ascends the circular stone foundation of the round tower. By the\r\nby, it cannot be more than ten feet high, at the utmost, instead of\r\nfifteen.\r\n\r\nThe prospect from the top of Wachusett is the finest that I have\r\nseen,--the elevation being not so great as to snatch the beholder from\r\nall sympathy with earth. The roads that wind along at the foot of the\r\nmountain are discernible; and the villages, lying separate and\r\nunconscious of one another, each with their little knot of peculiar\r\ninterests, but all gathered into one category by the observer above\r\nthem. White spires, and the white glimmer of hamlets, perhaps a dozen\r\nmiles off. The gleam of lakes afar, giving life to the whole landscape.\r\nMuch wood, shagging hills and plains. On the west, a hill-country,\r\nswelling like waves, with these villages sometimes discovered among\r\nthem. On the east it looks dim and blue, and affects the beholder like\r\nthe sea, as the eye stretches far away. On the north (?) appears\r\nMonadnock, in his whole person, discernible from the feet upwards,\r\nrising boldly and tangibly to the sense, so that you have the figure\r\nwholly before you, fair and blue, but not dim and cloudlike.\r\n\r\nOn the road from Princeton to Fitchburg we passed fields which were\r\nentirely covered with the mountain-laurel in full bloom,--as splendid a\r\nspectacle, in its way, as could be imagined. Princeton is a little town,\r\nlying on a high ridge, exposed to all the stirrings of the upper air,\r\nand with a prospect of a score of miles round about. The great family of\r\nthis place is that of the Boylstons, who own Wachusett, and have a\r\nmansion, with good pretensions to architecture, in Princeton.\r\n\r\nNotables: Old Gregory, the dweller of the mountain-side; his\r\nhigh-spirited wife; the son, speaking gruffly from behind the scenes, in\r\nanswer to his father's inquiries as to the expediency of lodging us. The\r\nbrisk little landlord at Princeton, recently married, intelligent,\r\nhonest, lively, agreeable; his wife, with her young-ladyish manners\r\nstill about her; the second class of annuals, and other popular\r\nliterature, in the parlors of the house; colored engraving of the\r\nexplosion of the Princeton's gun, with the principal characters in that\r\nscene, designated by name; also Death of Napoleon, &c. A young Mr.\r\nBoylston boarding at the inn, and driving out in a beautiful, city-built\r\nphaeton, of exquisite lightness. We met him and a lady in the phaeton,\r\nand two other ladies on horseback, in a narrow path, densely wooded, on\r\nthe ascent of a hill. It was quite romantic. Likewise old Mr. Boylston,\r\nfrequenting the tavern, coming in after church, and smoking a cigar,...\r\nentering into conversation with strangers about the ascent of the\r\nmountain. The tailor of the place, with his queer advertisement pasted\r\non the wall of the barroom, comprising certificates from tailors in New\r\nYork City, and various recommendations, from clergymen and others, of\r\nhis moral and religious character. Two Shakers in the cars,--both, if I\r\nmistake not, with thread gloves on. The foundation of the old\r\nmeeting-house of Princeton, standing on a height above the village, as\r\nbleak and windy as the top of Mount Ararat; also the old deserted\r\ntown-house. The edifices were probably thus located in order to be more\r\nexactly in the centre of the township.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom July 25 to August 9, 1845, at Portsmouth Navy Yard. Remarkables:\r\nthe free and social mode of life among the officers and their families,\r\nmeeting at evening on the door-steps or in front of their houses, or\r\nstepping in familiarly; the rough-hewn first lieutenant, with no ideas\r\nbeyond the service; the doctor, priding himself on his cultivation and\r\nrefinement, pretending to elegance, sensitive, touchy; the\r\nsailing-master, an old salt, of the somewhat modernized Tom Bowline\r\npattern, tossed about by fifty years of stormy surges, and at last swept\r\ninto this quiet nook, where he tells yarns of his cruises and duels,\r\nrepeats his own epitaph, drinks a reasonable quantity of grog, and\r\ncomplains of dyspepsia; the old fat major of marines, with a brown wig\r\nnot pretending to imitate natural hair, but only to cover his baldness\r\nand grayness with something that he imagines will be less unsightly: he\r\nhas a potent odor of snuff, but has left off wine and strong drink for\r\nthe last twenty-seven years. A Southerner, all astray among our New\r\nEngland manners, but reconciling himself to them, like a long practised\r\nman of the world, only somewhat tremulous at the idea of a New England\r\nwinter. The lieutenant of marines, a tall, red-haired man, between\r\nthirty and forty, stiff in his motions from the effect of a palsy\r\ncontracted in Florida,--a man of thought, both as to his profession and\r\nother matters, particularly matters spiritual,--a convert, within a few\r\nyears, to Papistry,--a seer of ghosts,--a dry joker, yet sad and earnest\r\nin his nature,--a scientific soldier, criticising Jackson's military\r\ntalent,--fond of discussion, with much more intellect than he finds\r\nemployment for,--withal, somewhat simple. Then the commandant of the\r\nyard, Captain S----, a man without brilliancy, of plain aspect and\r\nsimple manners, but just, upright, kindly, with an excellent practical\r\nintellect; his next in rank, Commander P----, an officer-like,\r\nmiddle-aged man, with such cultivation as a sensible man picks up about\r\nthe world; and with what little tincture he imbibes from a bluish wife.\r\nIn the vicinity of the Navy Yard, an engineer-officer, stationed for a\r\nyear or two past on a secluded point of the coast, making a map,\r\nminutely finished, on a very extensive scale, of country and coast near\r\nPortsmouth; he is red-nosed, and has the aspect of a free liver; his\r\ncompanion, a civil engineer, with much more appearance of intellectual\r\nactivity. Their map is spread out in a room that looks forth upon the\r\nsea and islands, and has all the advantages of sea-air,--very desirable\r\nfor summer, but gloomy as a winter residence.\r\n\r\nAt Fort Constitution are many officers,--a major and two lieutenants,\r\nthe former living in a house within the walls of the fort, the latter\r\noccupying small residences outside. They are coarse men, apparently of\r\nfew ideas, and not what one can call gentlemen. They are likewise less\r\nfrank and hospitable than the navy officers. Their quarters have not the\r\naspect of homes, although they continue for a term of years, five or\r\nmore, on one station, whereas the navy officers are limited to two or\r\nthree. But then the former migrate with their families to new stations,\r\nwhereas the wives of the naval officers, though ejected from the\r\nnavy-yard houses, yet, not accompanying their husbands on service,\r\nremain to form a nucleus of home.\r\n\r\nTwo or three miles from the Navy Yard, on Kittery Point, stands the\r\nformer residence of Sir William Pepperell. It is a gambrel-roofed house,\r\nvery long and spacious, and looks venerable and imposing from its\r\ndimensions. A decent, respectable, intelligent woman admitted us, and\r\nshowed us from bottom to top of her part of the house; she being a\r\ntenant of one half. The rooms were not remarkable for size, but were\r\npanelled on every side. The staircase is the best feature, ascending\r\ngradually, broad and square, and with an elaborate balustrade; and over\r\nthe front door there is a wide window and a spacious breadth, where the\r\nold baronet and his guests, after dinner, might sit and look out upon\r\nthe water and his ships at anchor. The garret is one apartment,\r\nextending over the whole house. The kitchen is very small,--much too\r\nsmall for the credit of the house, were it not redeemed by the size of\r\nthe fireplace, which originally could not have been less than fourteen\r\nfeet, though now abridged by an oven, which has been built within it.\r\nThe hearth extends half-way across the floor of the kitchen. On one\r\nside, the road passes close by the house; on the other, it stands within\r\nfifty yards of the shore. I recollect no outhouses. At a short distance,\r\nacross the road, is a marble tomb, on the level slab of which is the\r\nPepperell coat of arms, and an inscription in memory of Sir William's\r\nfather, to whom the son seems to have erected it,--although it is the\r\nfamily tomb. We saw no other trace of Sir William or his family.\r\nPrecisely a hundred years since he was in his glory. None of the name\r\nnow exist here,--or elsewhere, as far as I know. A descendant of the\r\nSparhawks, one of whom married Pepperell's daughter, is now keeper of a\r\nfort in the vicinity,--a poor man. Lieutenant Baker tells me that he has\r\nrecently discovered a barrel full of the old family papers.\r\n\r\nThe house in Portsmouth now owned and occupied by the Rev. Mr. Burroughs\r\nwas formerly the mansion of Governor Langdon. It contains noble and\r\nspacious rooms. The Doctor's library is a fine apartment, extending, I\r\nthink, the whole breadth of the house, forty or fifty feet, with\r\nelaborate cornices, a carved fireplace, and other antiquated\r\nmagnificences. It was, I suppose, the reception-room, and occasionally\r\nthe dining-hall. The opposite parlor is likewise large, and finished in\r\nexcellent style, the mantelpiece being really a fine architectural\r\nspecimen.... Doctor Burroughs is a scholar, rejoicing in the possession\r\nof an old, illuminated missal, which he showed us, adorned with\r\nbrilliant miniatures and other pictures by some monkish hand. It was\r\ngiven him by a commodore in the navy, who picked it up in Italy, without\r\nknowing what it was, nor could the learned professors of at least one\r\ncollege inform him, until he finally offered it to Dr. Burroughs, on\r\ncondition that he should tell him what it was. We likewise saw a copy of\r\nthe famous \"Breeches Bible,\" and other knicknacks and curiosities which\r\npeople have taken pleasure in giving to one who appreciated such things,\r\nand whose kindly disposition makes it a happiness to oblige him. His\r\nhouse has entertained famous guests in the time of the old\r\nGovernor,--among them Louis Philippe, Talleyrand, Lafayette, and\r\nWashington, all of whom occupied successively the same chamber; besides,\r\nno doubt, a host of less world-wide distinguished persons.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA battery of thirty-two pound periods.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the eyes of a young child or other innocent person, the image of a\r\ncherub or an angel to be seen peeping out,--in those of a vicious\r\nperson, a devil.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_October 11._ In Boston, a man passing along Colonnade Row, grinding a\r\nbarrel-organ, and attended by a monkey, dressed in frock and pantaloons,\r\nand with a tremendously thick tail appearing behind. While his master\r\nplayed on the organ, the monkey kept pulling off his hat, bowing and\r\nscraping to the spectators, round about,--sometimes, too, making a\r\ndirect application to an individual,--by all this dumb show, beseeching\r\nthem to remunerate the organ-player. Whenever a coin was thrown on the\r\nground, the monkey picked it up, clambered on his master's shoulder, and\r\ngave it into his keeping, then descended, and repeated his pantomimic\r\nentreaties for more. His little, old, ugly, wrinkled face had an\r\nearnestness that looked just as if it came from the love of money deep\r\nwithin his soul. He peered round, searching for filthy lucre on all\r\nsides. With his tail and all, he might be taken for the Mammon of\r\ncopper coin,--a symbol of covetousness of small gains,--the lowest form\r\nof the love of money.\r\n\r\nBaby was with us, holding by my forefinger, and walking decorously along\r\nthe pavement. She stopped to contemplate the monkey, and after a while,\r\nshocked by his horrible ugliness, began to cry.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA disquisition or a discussion between two or more persons, on the\r\nmanner in which the Wandering Jew has spent his life. One period,\r\nperhaps, trying over and over again to grasp domestic happiness; then a\r\nsoldier, then a statesman, &c., at last realizing some truth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe most graceful way in which a man can signify that he feels that he\r\nis growing old, and acquiesces in it, is by adhering to the fashion of\r\ndress which chances to be in vogue when the conviction comes upon him.\r\nThus, in a few years, he will find himself quietly apart from the crowd\r\nof young men.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur most intimate friend is not he to whom we show the worst, but the\r\nbest of our nature.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNothing comes amiss to Nature,--all is fish that comes to her net. If\r\nthere be a living form of perfect beauty, instinct with soul,--why, it\r\nis all very well, and suits Nature well enough. But she would just as\r\nlief have that beautiful, soul-illumined body for worms' meat and\r\nearth's manure!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nInstances of two ladies, who vowed never again to see the light of the\r\nsun, on account of disappointments in love. Each of them kept her vow,\r\nliving thenceforth, and dying after many years, in apartments closely\r\nshut up, and lighted by candles. One appears to have lived in total\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe infirmities that come with old age may be the interest on the debt\r\nof nature, which should have been more seasonably paid.

(On\r\nOctober 14, 1837, I recorded a walk thither.) In a line with the length\r\nof the ridge, the ascent is gradual and easy, but straight up the sides\r\nit is steep. There is a large and well-kept orchard at the foot, through\r\nwhich I passed, gradually ascending; then, surmounting a stone wall,\r\nbeneath chestnut-trees which had thrown their dry leaves down, I climbed\r\nthe remainder of the hill. There were still the frequent\r\nbarberry-bushes; and the wood-wax has begun to tuft itself over the\r\nsides and summit, which seem to be devoted to pasture. On the very\r\nhighest part are still the traces of the foundation of the old mansion.\r\nThe hall had a gallery running round it beneath the ceiling, and was a\r\nfamous place for dancing. The house stood, I believe, till some years\r\nsubsequent to the Revolution, and was then removed in three portions,\r\neach of which became a house somewhere on the plain, and perhaps they\r\nare standing now. The proprietor, being a royalist, became an exile when\r\nthe Revolution broke out, and I suppose died abroad. I know not whether\r\nthe house was intended as a permanent family-residence or merely as a\r\npleasure-place for the summer; but from its extent I should conceive the\r\nformer to have been its purpose. Be that as it may, it has perpetuated\r\nan imputation of folly upon the poor man who erected it, which still\r\nkeeps his memory disagreeably alive after a hundred years. The house\r\nmust have made a splendid appearance for many miles around; and the\r\nglare of the old-fashioned festivities would be visible, doubtless, in\r\nthe streets of Salem, when he illuminated his windows to celebrate a\r\nking's birthday, or some other loyal occasion. The barberry-bushes,\r\nclustering within the cellars, offer the harsh acidity of their fruit\r\nto-day, instead of the ripe wines which used to be stored there.\r\n\r\nDescending the hill, I entered a green, seldom-trodden lane, which runs\r\nalong at a hundred yards or two from its base, and parallel with its\r\nridge. It was overshadowed by chestnut-trees, and bordered with the\r\nprevalent barberry-bush, and between ran the track,--the beaten path of\r\nthe horses' feet, and the even way of either wheel, with green strips\r\nbetween. It was a very lonely lane, and very pleasant in the warm,\r\ndeclining sun; and, following it a third of a mile, I came to a place\r\nthat was familiar to me when I was a child, as the residence of a\r\ncountry cousin whom I used to be brought to see. There was his old house\r\nstill standing, but deserted, with all the windows boarded up, and the\r\ndoor likewise, and the chimneys removed,--a most desolate-looking place.\r\nA young dog came barking towards me as I approached,--barking, but\r\nfrisking, between play and watchfulness. Within fifty yards of the old\r\nhouse, farther back from the road, stands a stone house, of some dozen\r\nor twenty years' endurance,--an ugly affair, so plain is it,--which was\r\nbuilt by the old man in his latter days. The well of the old house, out\r\nof which I have often drunk, and over the curb of which I have peeped to\r\nsee my own boy-visage closing the far vista below, seems to be still in\r\nuse for the new edifice. Passing on a little farther, I came to a brook,\r\nwhich, I remember, the old man's son and I dammed up, so that it almost\r\noverflowed the road. The stream has strangely shrunken now; it is a mere\r\nditch, indeed, and almost a dry one. Going a little farther, I came to a\r\ngraveyard by the roadside,--not apparently a public graveyard, but the\r\nresting-place of a family or two, with half a dozen gravestones. On two\r\nmarble stones, standing side by side, I read the names of Benjamin\r\nFoster and Anstiss Foster, the people whom I used to be brought to\r\nvisit. He had died in 1824, aged seventy-five; she in 1837, aged\r\nseventy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA young woman in England, poisoned by an East Indian barbed dart, which\r\nher brother had brought home as a curiosity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe old house on Browne's Hill was removed from the summit to the plain,\r\nat a short distance from the foot of the hill. Colonel Putnam, of the\r\nCustom-House, recollects it there, standing unoccupied, but with the\r\nfurniture still in it. It seems to have been accessible to all who\r\nwished to enter. It was at that time under the care of Richard Derby, an\r\nancestor of the present Derbys, who had a claim to the property through\r\nhis wife, who was a Browne. The owner of the house had fled during the\r\nRevolution, and Richard Derby seems to have held the estate as it was\r\nwhen the refugee left it, in expectation of his eventual return. There\r\nwas one closet in the house which everybody was afraid to open, it being\r\nsupposed that the Devil was in it. One day, above fifty years ago, or\r\nthreescore it may have been, Putnam and other boys were playing in the\r\nhouse, and took it into their heads to peep into this closet. It was\r\nlocked, but Putnam pried open the door, with great difficulty and much\r\ntremor. At last it flew open, and out fell a great pile of family\r\nportraits, faces of gentlemen in wigs, and ladies in quaint\r\nhead-dresses, displaying themselves on the floor, startling the urchins\r\nout of their wits. They all fled, but returned after a while, piled up\r\nthe pictures again, and nailed up the door of the closet.\r\n\r\nThe house, according to the same authority, was not tenanted after the\r\nearthquake of 1775; at least, it was removed from the summit of the hill\r\non that occasion, it having been greatly shaken by the earthquake.\r\n\r\nThe house formerly inhabited by Rev. Mr. Paris, and in which the\r\nwitchcraft business of 1692 had its origin, is still standing in the\r\nnorth parish of Danvers. It has been long since removed from its\r\noriginal site. The workmen at first found great difficulty in removing\r\nit; and an old man assured them that the house was still under the\r\ninfluence of the Devil, and would remain so unless they took off the\r\nroof. Finally they did take off the roof, and then succeeded in moving\r\nthe house. Putnam was personally cognizant of this fact.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_November 17_.--A story of the effects of revenge in diabolizing him who\r\nindulges in it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Committee of Vigilance, instituted to promote the discovery of old\r\nMr. White's murderers,--good as the machinery of a sketch or story.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA story of the life, domestic and external, of a family of birds in a\r\nmarten-house, for children.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe people believed that John Hancock's uncle had bought an immense\r\ndiamond at a low price, and sold it for its value,--he having grown rich\r\nwith a rapidity inexplicable to them.

The appearance is\r\nnever observable when looking directly towards the window, but only by\r\nsuch a sidelong or indirect glance as one gets while reading, or when\r\nintent on something else. But I know not how many times I have raised my\r\nhead or turned with the certainty that somebody were passing. The other\r\nday I found that my wife was equally aware of the spectacle, and that,\r\nas likewise agrees with my own observation, it always appears to be\r\nentering the yard from the street, never going out.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe immortal flowers,--a child's story.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"He looked as if he had been standing up thirty years against a\r\nnortheast storm.\" Description of an old mate of a vessel, by Pike.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDeath possesses a good deal of real estate, namely, the graveyards in\r\nevery town.

The ship passed close to it, and it was\r\napparently longer than the long-boat, \"with a head bigger than any dog's\r\nhead you ever see,\" and great prickles on his back a foot long. Arriving\r\nat Batavia, he told the story, and an old pilot exclaimed, \"What! have\r\nyou seen Bellysore Tom?\" It seems that the pilots had been acquainted\r\nwith this turtle as many as twelve years, and always found him in the\r\nsame latitude. They never did him any injury, but were accustomed to\r\nthrow him pieces of meat, which he received in good part, so that there\r\nwas a mutual friendship between him and the pilots. Old Mr. L----, in\r\nconfirmation of the story, asserted that he had often heard other\r\nshipmasters speak of the same, monster; but he being a notorious liar,\r\nand Captain B---- an unconscionable spinner of long yarns and\r\ntravellers' tales, the evidence is by no means perfect. The pilots\r\nestimated his length at not less than twenty feet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Grey Property Case. Mrs. Grey and her child three years old were\r\ncarried off by the Indians in 1756 from the Tuscarora valley in\r\nPennsylvania. The father, going on a campaign in search of them, was\r\nexhausted by fatigue, and came home only to die, bequeathing half his\r\nproperty to his child, if living. The mother, his wife, being redeemed,\r\nand there being several children who had been captive to the Indians to\r\nbe seen at Philadelphia, went thither to see and recognize her little\r\nthree years' old daughter, from whom, in her captivity, she had been\r\nseparated. Her child proved not to be among the little captives; but, in\r\norder to get possession of her husband's property, she claimed another\r\nchild, of about the same age. This child grew up gross, ugly, awkward, a\r\n\"big, black, uncomely Dutch lump, not to be compared to the beautiful\r\nFanny Grey,\" and moreover turned out morally bad. The real daughter was\r\nsaid to have been married, and settled in New York, \"a fine woman, with\r\na fair house and fair children.\" At all events, she was never recovered\r\nby her relatives, and her existence seems to have been doubtful. In\r\n1789, the heirs of John Grey, the father, became aware that the claimed\r\nand recovered child was not the child that had been lost. They commenced\r\na lawsuit for the recovery of John Grey's property, consisting of a farm\r\nof three or four hundred acres. This lawsuit lasted till 1834, when it\r\nwas decided against the identity of the recovered child. (Sherman Day's\r\nHist.

He gave her news of her husband,\r\nand, joining the sleighing party, began to grow familiar with Mrs.\r\nVincent, and wished to take her upon his lap. She resisted,--but behold!\r\nthe rough-looking stranger was her long-lost husband. There are good\r\npoints in this story.

Moonlight produces a very beautiful effect in the room,\r\nfalling so white upon the carpet, and showing its figures so distinctly,\r\nand making all the room so visible, and yet so different from a morning\r\nor noontide visibility. There are all the familiar things, every chair,\r\nthe tables, the couch, the bookcase, all that we are accustomed to see\r\nin the daytime; but now it seems as if we were remembering them through\r\na lapse of years, rather than seeing them with the immediate eye. A\r\nchild's shoe, the doll, sitting in her little wicker-carriage, all\r\nobjects that have been used or played with during the day, though still\r\nas familiar as ever, are invested with something like strangeness and\r\nremoteness. I cannot in any measure express it. Then the somewhat dim\r\ncoal fire throws its unobtrusive tinge through the room,--a faint\r\nruddiness upon the wall,--which has a not unpleasant effect in taking\r\nfrom the colder spirituality of the moonbeams. Between both these lights\r\nsuch a medium is created that the room seems just fit for the ghosts of\r\npersons very dear, who have lived in the room with us, to glide\r\nnoiselessly in and sit quietly down, without affrighting us. It would be\r\nlike a matter of course to look round and find some familiar form in one\r\nof the chairs. If one of the white curtains happen to be drawn before\r\nthe windows, the moonlight makes a delicate tracery with the branches of\r\nthe trees, the leaves somewhat thinned by the progress of autumn, but\r\nstill pretty abundant. It is strange how utterly I have failed to give\r\nanything of the effect of moonlight in a room.\r\n\r\nThe firelight diffuses a mild, heart-warm influence through the parlor,\r\nbut is scarcely visible, unless you particularly look for it; and then\r\nyou become conscious of a faint tinge upon the ceiling, of a reflected\r\ngleam from the mahogany furniture, and, if your eyes happen to fall on\r\nthe looking-glass, deep within it you perceive the glow of the burning\r\nanthracite. I hate to leave such a scene; and when retiring to bed,\r\nafter closing the door, I reopen it again and again, to peep back at the\r\nwarm, cheerful, solemn repose, the white light, the faint ruddiness, the\r\ndimness,--all like a vision, and which makes me feel as if I were in a\r\nconscious dream.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first manufacture of the kind of candy called Gibraltar rock, for a\r\nchild's story; to be told in a romantic, mystic, marvellous style.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn angel comes from heaven, commissioned to gather up, put into a\r\nbasket, and carry away everything good that is not improved by mankind,\r\nfor whose benefit it was intended.

Started by way of Boston, in the half past\r\nten train, and took the Lowell and Nashua Railroad at twelve, as far as\r\nDanforth's Corner, about fifty miles, and thence in stage-coach to\r\nMilford, four miles farther, and in a light wagon to Temple, perhaps\r\ntwelve miles farther. During the latter drive, the road gradually\r\nascended, with tracts of forest land alongside, and latterly a brook,\r\nwhich we followed for several miles, and finally found it flowing\r\nthrough General M----'s farm. The house is an old country dwelling, in\r\ngood condition, standing beside the road, in a valley surrounded by a\r\nwide amphitheatre of high hills. There is a good deal of copse and\r\nforest on the estate, high hills of pasture land, old, cultivated\r\nfields, and all such pleasant matters. The General sat in an easy-chair\r\nin the common room of the family, looking better than when in Salem,\r\nwith an air of quiet, vegetative enjoyment about him, scarcely alive to\r\noutward objects. He did his best to express a hospitable pleasure at\r\nseeing me; but did not succeed, so that I could distinguish his words.\r\nHe loves to sit amidst the bustle of his family, and is dimly amused by\r\nwhat is going forward; is pleased, also, to look out of the open window\r\nand see the poultry--a guinea-hen, turkeys, a peacock, a tame deer,\r\netc.--which feed there. His mind sometimes wanders, and he hardly knows\r\nwhere he is; will not be convinced that he is anywhere but at Salem,\r\nuntil they drag his chair to a window from which he can see a great\r\nelm-tree of which he is very fond, standing in front of the house. Then\r\nhe acknowledges that he must be at the farm, because, he says, they\r\nnever could have transplanted that tree. He is pleased with flowers,\r\nwhich they bring him,--a kind-hearted old man. The other day a live\r\npartridge was sent him, and he ordered it to be let go, because he would\r\nnot suffer a life to be taken to supply him with a single meal. This\r\ntenderness has always been characteristic of the old soldier. His\r\nbirthplace was within a few miles of this spot,--the son and descendant\r\nof husbandmen,--and character and fortune together have made him a man\r\nof history.\r\n\r\nThis is a most hospitable family, and they live in a style of plain\r\nabundance, rural, but with traits of more refined modes. Many domestics,\r\nboth for farm and household work. Two unmarried daughters; an old maiden\r\naunt; an elderly lady, Mrs. C. of Newburyport, visiting; a young girl of\r\nfifteen, a connection of the family, also visiting, and now confined to\r\nher chamber by illness. Ney, a spaniel of easy and affable address, is a\r\nprominent personage, and generally lies in the parlor or sits beside the\r\nGeneral's chair; always ready, too, to walk out with anybody so\r\ninclined. Flora, a little black pony, is another four-footed favorite.\r\nIn the warm weather, the family dine in a large room on one side of the\r\nhouse, rough and rustic looking, with rude beams overhead. There were\r\nevergreens hanging on the walls, and the figures 1776, also in\r\nevergreen, and a national flag suspended in one corner,--the blue being\r\nmade out of old homespun garments, the red stripes out of some of the\r\nGeneral's flannel wrappings, and the eagle copied from the figure on a\r\nhalf-dollar,--all being the handiwork of the ladies, on occasion of the\r\nlast Fourth of July. It is quite a pleasant dining-hall; and while we\r\nwere eating fruit, the deer, which is of a small and peculiar breed from\r\nthe South, came and thrust its head into the open window, looking at us\r\nwith beautiful and intelligent eyes. It had smelt the fruit, and wished\r\nto put in its claim for a share.\r\n\r\nTuesday morning, before breakfast, E---- and I drove three or four\r\nmiles, to the summit of an intervening ridge, from which we had a wide\r\nprospect of hill and dale, with Monadnock in the midst. It was a good\r\nsight, although the atmosphere did not give the hills that aspect of\r\nbulk and boldness which it sometimes does. This part of the country is\r\nbut thinly inhabited, and the dwellings are generally small. It is said\r\nthat, in the town of Temple, there are more old cellars, where dwellings\r\nhave formerly stood, than there are houses now inhabited. The town is\r\nnot far from a hundred years old, but contains now only five or six\r\nhundred inhabitants. The enterprising young men emigrate elsewhere,\r\nleaving only the least energetic portions to carry on business at home.\r\nThere appear to be but few improvements, the cultivated fields being of\r\nold date, smooth with long cultivation. Here and there, however, a tract\r\nnewly burned over, or a few acres with the stumps still extant. The\r\nfarm-houses all looked very lonesome and deserted to-day, the\r\ninhabitants having gone to the regimental muster at New Ipswich.\r\n\r\nAs we drove home, E---- told a story of a child who was lost, seventy or\r\neighty years ago, among the woods and hills. He was about five years\r\nold, and had gone with some work-people to a clearing in the forest,\r\nwhere there was a rye-field, at a considerable distance from the\r\nfarm-house. Getting tired, he started for home alone, but did not\r\narrive. They made what search for him they could that night, and the\r\nnext day the whole town turned out, but without success. The day\r\nfollowing, many people from the neighboring towns took up the search,\r\nand on this day, I believe, they found the child's shoes and stockings,\r\nbut nothing else. After a while, they gave up the search in despair; but\r\nfor a long time, a fortnight or three weeks or more, his mother fancied\r\nthat she heard the boy's voice in the night, crying, \"Father! father!\"\r\nOne of his little sisters also heard this voice; but people supposed\r\nthat the sounds must be those of some wild animal. No more search was\r\nmade, and the boy never was found.\r\n\r\nBut it is not known whether it was the next autumn, or a year or two\r\nafter, some hunters came upon traces of the child's wanderings among the\r\nhills, in a different direction from the previous search, and farther\r\nthan it was supposed he could have gone. They found some little houses,\r\nsuch as children build of twigs and sticks of wood, and these the little\r\nfellow had probably built for amusement in his lonesome hours. Nothing,\r\nit seems to me, was ever more strangely touching than this\r\nincident,--his finding time for childish play, while wandering to his\r\ndeath in these desolate woods,--and then pursuing his way again, till at\r\nlast he lay down to die on the dark mountain-side. Finally, on a hill\r\nwhich E---- pointed out to me, they found a portion of the child's hair\r\nadhering to the overthrown trunk of a tree; and this is all that was\r\never found of him. But it was supposed that the child had subsisted,\r\nperhaps for weeks, on the berries and other sustenance such as a\r\nforest-child knew how to find in the woods. I forgot to say, above, that\r\na piece of birch or other bark was found, which he appeared to have\r\ngnawed. It was thought that the cry of \"Father! father!\" which the\r\nmother and little sister heard in the night-time, was really the little\r\nfellow's voice, then within hearing of his home; but he wandered away\r\nagain, and at last sank down, and Death found him and carried him up to\r\nGod. His bones were never found; and it was thought that the foxes or\r\nother wild animals had taken his little corpse, and scattered the bones,\r\nand that, dragging the body along, one lock of his flaxen hair had\r\nadhered to a tree.\r\n\r\nI asked a physician whether it were possible that a child could live so\r\nlong in the woods; and he thought it was, and said that children often\r\nshow themselves more tenacious of life than grown people, and live\r\nlonger in a famine. This is to me a very affecting story; and it seems\r\nto be felt as such by the people of the country. The little boy's\r\nparents, and his brothers and sisters, who probably lived to maturity or\r\nold age, are all forgotten; but he lives in tradition, and still causes\r\nwet eyes to strangers, as he did to me.\r\n\r\nTo account for the singularity of his not having been found by such\r\nnumbers as took up the search, it is suggested that he was perhaps\r\nfrightened, and perhaps concealed himself when he heard the noise of\r\npeople making their way through the forest, people being apt to do so,\r\nwhen they get mazed with wandering in the woods. But it is strange that\r\nold hunters, with dogs, should have failed to find him. However, there\r\nis the fact.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast (a broiled chicken and excellent coffee) I walked out by\r\nmyself. The brook would be a beautiful plaything for my children, and I\r\nwish I had such a one for them. As I looked down into it from the\r\nbridge, I saw little fish, minnows, small chubs, and perch sporting\r\nabout and rising eagerly to anything that was thrown in. Returning\r\ntowards the house, I encountered an ass, who seemed glad to see me, in\r\nits donkeyish way. Afterwards, E---- and I took a ramble among some of\r\nhis old haunts, which took up pretty much all the remainder of the\r\nforenoon. After dinner we drove to New Ipswich, expecting to see the\r\nclosing scenes of the muster, but found the regiment dismissed, and the\r\nspectators taking their departure. We visited a cousin of E----, and\r\ntook tea; borrowed two great-coats (it having grown from summer to\r\nautumn very rapidly since nightfall), and drove home, six miles or\r\nthereabouts. A new moon and the long twilight gleamed over the first\r\nportion of our drive, and then the northern lights kindled up and shot\r\nflashes towards the zenith as we drove along, up hill and down dale, and\r\nmost of the way through dense woods.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, after breakfast, we got into our wagon and returned to\r\nMilford, thence by stage to Danforth's Corner, thence to Boston by rail.\r\nNothing noteworthy occurred, except that we called on Mr. Atherton and\r\nlady at Nashua. We reached Boston at three o'clock. I visited the Town\r\nand Country Club, and read the papers and journals, took the three\r\nquarters past five train and reached home at half past six.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the new statistical account of Scotland, in the volume about the\r\nHebrides, it is stated that a child was born, and lived to the age of, I\r\nthink, two years, with an eye in the back of its head, in addition to\r\nthe usual complement in front. It could evidently see with this eye; for\r\nwhen its cap was drawn down over it, it would thrust it upward.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_October 27._--Mrs.---- gave a black woman six dollars for a dress of\r\npine-apple cloth, sixteen yards, perhaps worth ten times as much,--the\r\nowner being ignorant of the value.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo inherit a great fortune.--To inherit a great misfortune.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nReflections in a mud-puddle;--they might be pictures of life in a mean\r\nstreet of a city.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_February 16, 1850._--The sunbeam that comes through a round hole in the\r\nshutter of a darkened room, where a dead man sits in solitude.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe hoary periwig of a dandelion gone to seed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Lenox, July 14, 1850._--Language,--human language,--after all, is but\r\nlittle better than the croak and cackle of fowls, and other utterances\r\nof brute nature, sometimes not so adequate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe queer gestures and sounds of a hen looking about for a place to\r\ndeposit her egg, her self-important gait, the sideway turn of her head\r\nand cock of her eye, as she pries into one and another nook, croaking\r\nall the while, evidently with the idea that the egg in question is the\r\nmost important thing that has been brought to pass since the world\r\nbegan.

But\r\nthe moss had accumulated on them, and, leaves falling over them from\r\nyear to year, and decaying, a kind of soil had quite covered them,\r\nalthough the softened outline of the woodpile was perceptible in the\r\ngreen mound. It was perhaps fifty years, perhaps more, since the woodman\r\nhad cut and piled these logs and sticks, intending them for his winter\r\nfire. But he probably needs no fire now. There was something strangely\r\ninteresting in this simple circumstance. Imagine the long-dead woodman,\r\nand his long-dead wife and family, and one old man who was a little\r\nchild when the wood was cut, coming back from their graves, and trying\r\nto make a fire with this mossy fuel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_September 19._--Lying by the lake yesterday afternoon, with my eyes\r\nshut, while the breeze and sunshine were playing together on the water,\r\nthe quick glimmer of the wavelets was perceptible through my closed\r\neyelids.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_October 13._--A cool day,--the wind northwest, with a general\r\nprevalence of dull gray clouds over the sky, but with brief, sudden\r\nglimpses of sunshine. The foliage having its autumn hues, Monument\r\nMountain looks like a headless Sphinx, wrapt in a rich Persian shawl.\r\nYesterday, through a diffused mist, with the sun shining on it, it had\r\nthe aspect of burnished copper. The sun-gleams on the hills are\r\npeculiarly magnificent, just in these days.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_October 13._--One of the children, drawing a cow on the blackboard,\r\nsays, \"I'll kick this leg out a little more,\"--a very happy energy of\r\nexpression, completely identifying herself with the cow; or, perhaps, as\r\nthe cow's creator, conscious of full power over its movements.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_October 14._--The brilliancy of the foliage has past its acme; and,\r\nindeed, it has not been so magnificent this season as usual, owing to\r\nthe gradual approaches of cool weather, and there having been slight\r\nfrosts instead of severe ones. There is still a shaggy richness on the\r\nhillsides.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_October 16._--A morning mist, filling up the whole length and breadth\r\nof the valley, between the house and Monument Mountain, the summit of\r\nthe mountain emerging. The mist reaches to perhaps a hundred yards of\r\nme, so dense as to conceal everything, except that near its hither\r\nboundary a few ruddy or yellow tree-tops rise up, glorified by the early\r\nsunshine, as is likewise the whole mist-cloud. There is a glen between\r\nour house and the lake, through which winds a little brook, with pools\r\nand tiny waterfalls, over the great roots of trees. The glen is deep and\r\nnarrow, and filled with trees; so that, in the summer, it is all in dark\r\nshadow. Now, the foliage of the trees being almost entirely of a golden\r\nyellow, instead of being obscure, the glen is absolutely full of\r\nsunshine, and its depths are more brilliant than the open plain or the\r\nmountain-tops. The trees are sunshine, and, many of the golden leaves\r\nhaving freshly fallen, the glen is strewn with light, amid which winds\r\nand gurgles the bright, dark little brook.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_October 28._--On a walk yesterday forenoon, my wife and children\r\ngathered Houstonias. Before night there was snow, mingled with rain. The\r\ntrees are now generally bare.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_December 1._--I saw a dandelion in bloom near the lake, in a pasture by\r\nthe brookside. At night, dreamed of seeing Pike.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_December 19._--If the world were crumbled to the finest dust, and\r\nscattered through the universe, there would not be an atom of the dust\r\nfor each star.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKATHARINE MORNE.\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nSoon after Fanny's funeral, Miss Mehitable told me she had found out who\r\nthe lady was that wished for my painting at the fair. Her niece had\r\npointed her out as she drove by in a barouche; and it was Miss Dudley.\r\n\r\nMy second copy was begun in the last fortnight of Fanny's life, as she\r\nslept and I sat beside her. I had not then had time, nor since had\r\nheart, to go on with it. But now, seeing an opportunity to do something\r\nmore to fulfil her wishes and to \"do anything for Miss Dudley,\" I took\r\nup my task again, and quickly finished it. Then, still unsatisfied, I\r\nroamed through the woods, and along the shore, to gather specimens of\r\nthe native plants, insects, and shells that seemed to me most like the\r\nforeign ones that I had copied, and grouped and painted and framed them\r\nlike the first. The Doctor left both for me at Miss Dudley's gate, with\r\nthis inscription on the envelope: \"A little offering of great gratitude,\r\nfrom a sister of Fanny Morne.\" I suppose, by the way, this is one source\r\nof the satisfaction that some real mourners find in wearing mourning, as\r\nthey say, \"_for_ the dead,\"--a vague longing, like mine, after they have\r\npassed beyond human care, to do or sacrifice still something more for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAfter that, there seemed to be nothing more that I could do for Fanny,\r\nnor anything that, for myself, I cared to do. From habit only, I\r\nemployed myself. Julia, as she begged that I would call her, had a large\r\nbasket of baby-clothes cut out. At that I seated myself after breakfast;\r\nand at that I often worked till bedtime, like a machine,--startled\r\nsometimes from my revery, indeed, by seeing how much was done, but\r\nsaying nothing, hearing little, and shedding not a tear.\r\n\r\nJulia would have remonstrated; but the Doctor said to her: \"Let her\r\nalone for the present, my dear; she has had a great shock. Trust to\r\nnature. This cannot last long with a girl like Katy. It is half of it\r\nover-fatigue, carried on from her school-keeping to add to the present\r\naccount.\" To me he said: \"Katy, you may sew, if you like, but not\r\nin-doors, I will carry your basket out for you into the arbor; and in\r\nthe afternoon I am going to take you to ride in the woods.\"\r\n\r\nOur past selves are often a riddle that our present selves cannot read;\r\nbut I suspect the real state of the case was, partly that, as the Doctor\r\nbelieved, I was for the time being exhausted in body and stunned in\r\nmind, and partly that, in those young, impetuous days, grief was such an\r\nall-convulsing passion with me, when I yielded to it, that to the utmost\r\nof my strength I resisted it at the outset, and seldom dared suffer\r\nmyself to suffer at all. But, as he also believed, \"this could not last\r\nlong\"; and it did not.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, as I sewed in the arbor, a sweet little girl, who had\r\nbeen in Fanny's class in her Sunday school, stole into the garden and up\r\nto me, looked wistfully into my face as if seeking some likeness there,\r\nkissed my cheek timidly, laid a large nosegay of delicate flowers upon\r\nmy knee, and crept away as gently as she came. The flowers were all\r\nwhite; and I saw at once that they were meant for Fanny's grave. I might\r\ngo there for the first time now, as well as at any other time. The\r\nDoctor and his wife were out together, and no one was at home to\r\nquestion me.\r\n\r\nFanny had been laid, I need scarcely say, just where she wished. My\r\nguardian had driven me there early one morning to point out the place;\r\nand we found the withered clovers in the grass. It had rained often\r\nsince. The swollen turf was nearly healed. I untied the flowers, and\r\nslowly, and with minute precision, arranged them in a cross above her\r\nbreast. At last, when there was no blossom more to add or alter, I sat\r\ndown again in my solitude where I sat with her so lately, with the same\r\nleaves fluttering on the same trees, the same grass waving on the same\r\ngraves, and her beneath instead of upon it.\r\n\r\nAt first I could not think,--I could only cry. For now at length I had\r\nto cry; and cry I did, in a tornado and deluge of grief that by degrees\r\nswept and washed away the accumulated vapors from my mind, and brought\r\nit to a clearer, healthier calm. I believe God in His mercy has\r\nappointed that those who are capable of the strongest, shall not in\r\ngeneral be capable of the _longest_ anguish. At least, I am sure that it\r\nis so, not only with myself, but with one better and dearer than myself;\r\nso that the experience of life has taught me to see in the sharpest of\r\npangs the happiest augury of their brevity.\r\n\r\nThus it could not have been very long before I was able to raise my\r\nhead, and wipe my eyes, and look once more upon my two dear graves. The\r\nsetting sun glowed over them. They looked soft and bright. From one of\r\nthem the echo of an angel's voice seemed still to say, \"Here, by mamma,\r\nis where I _like_ to lie\"; from both in unison I heard, \"It is good and\r\nbrave to look things in the face and on all sides; but then among the\r\nsides, never forget the bright side, little Katy.\"\r\n\r\nCould I refuse? I looked for the bright side. It was not far to seek. In\r\nthe first place, the worst was over. Never again could I lose what I had\r\nlost, nor--so at least I thought then--could I feel what I had felt.\r\nSecondly, my sorrow was only mine, and no one's else. Those whom I loved\r\nwere happy, every one of them;--mamma and Fanny,--I could not doubt\r\nit,--happier far than I ever could have made them, even if I had always\r\ntried as hard as I did after they began to leave me,--safer than they\r\ncould ever have been in this world, and safe forever; and Jim,--I would\r\nnot begin now to think about him again, but just so much I must,--he was\r\nhappy with Emma. Even thus much brought a fresh gush of tears, though\r\nnot for him,--I could still truly say that I had never shed one for him,\r\nand that was some comfort to my pride at least;--but for Fanny; because\r\nI had sometimes thought that, when she was well and I had time to think\r\nof anything besides her, if I ever _did_ tell anybody of the mistake and\r\ntrouble I had fallen into, I would tell her,--and now, however much I\r\nmight need advice and assistance, _that_ could never be. My guardian and\r\nhis wife were happy in each other, and would be happier still after I\r\nroused myself, as I must and ought, and ceased to sadden their home. The\r\nworld in which I still must live was, whatever people might say of it,\r\nnot all sin, sickness, or sorrow. Even where I sat, in one of those\r\nspots which most persons accounted the dreariest in it, I could hear the\r\nlaughter of light-hearted children at their play, the soft lowing of\r\ncattle grazing in the pleasant fields, and shouts of strong men at their\r\nwholesome, useful work. I knew there must be sickness, sin, and sorrow\r\nin it; but could not I do some little to help them, with my free hands\r\nand the health and strength which were almost always mine? Very good I\r\nwas not myself, but I had been watchfully brought up in an innocent\r\nhome; there was no crime upon my conscience, and, even as I cast a\r\nrueful glance upon its blemishes, I heard a well-remembered voice say\r\nfrom a grave once more: \"Have patience with my little daughter. Some of\r\nthe richest fruits and souls are not the first to ripen. The chief thing\r\nthat she wants is time to mellow.\"\r\n\r\nAnd one of the brightest points in all the bright side was, that, in\r\nliving so constantly through her illness with Fanny, who lived with God,\r\nI had been perforce brought nearer to Him, and therefore naturally\r\nlearned to dread Him less and love Him more than I had done; so that I\r\nhoped, as I know my mother did, that the sunshine of His grace would\r\nhelp to mellow me.\r\n\r\nAnother bright point was, that I need not go back to Greenville. The\r\npresent mistress was glad to keep the school, and the committee willing\r\nto keep her.\r\n\r\nMy desultory thoughts still growing calmer, I began to form plans for my\r\nway of living, as I used to do aloud, when I could talk them over with\r\nmy mother and Fanny. I did not plan anything great, however, because I\r\nwas conscious of no great powers.--I already, I think, began to divine\r\nthe truth of what a wise woman afterwards said to me, \"Your own nature\r\nmust settle your work,\" or rather of what she implied, though she did\r\nnot say it: In laying out your work, you should do your best to take the\r\ndiagonal between your nature and your circumstances.--But I resolved,\r\nsuch as I was, to try to make the most of myself in every way, for\r\nmyself, my neighbors, and my God.\r\n\r\nI was to stay at my guardian's for the present. He forbade my trying to\r\nteach again, for some months at least. It was my duty, as well as my\r\npleasure, to obey him. In the mean time, I could prepare myself to teach\r\nbetter when I began again. I would draw and paint at odd times. Two\r\nhours a day I would try to divide between history and the English\r\nclassic poets, of both of which I knew sadly little. Julia often drove\r\nout with her husband; and then I could study by myself. When she was at\r\nhome, if I could not always chat with her as formerly, I could read to\r\nher in French, which she liked to hear; and that would be much more\r\nsociable and cheerful for her than my sitting mute. I would now exert\r\nmyself to walk out every day for exercise, so that there would be no\r\nreason for her giving up her place in the Doctor's chaise to me. I\r\nblushed to think how often I had suffered myself to be foisted into it\r\nby her already. By my walks, I would earn leave to sit with her\r\nin-doors; and then I could save her many steps and little household\r\ncares. Then what should I do for her husband? Sing to him in the\r\nevening, and begin, if he liked it, to-night. It might be a little hard\r\nthe first time; but if so, there was all the more reason for having the\r\nfirst time over. There was no need of my choosing sad songs, or any that\r\nFanny was fond of.\r\n\r\nBut it was growing late. They would be anxious. I must get up and go\r\nhome. Go _home_!--without my home-mates?--leave them here?--with no\r\nkiss,--no good-night? I stood up, and sat down again. The blinding,\r\nchoking passion, that had seemed over, swelled up into my eyes and\r\nthroat once more. O that lonely, empty life! Must I go back to it? How\r\nlong would it last? This was my only real home. When might I come here\r\nto sleep?\r\n\r\nIn an instant it would have been all over again with my hardly-won calm;\r\nbut in that instant a white and gray fluttering between the green graves\r\ncaught my tear-blurred sight. I thought it that of a living dove, but,\r\ngoing nearer, found only a piece of torn newspaper, which had been\r\nwrapped around the stems of the flowers, playing in the wind; and on it\r\nmy attention was caught by these quaint and pithy lines, printed in one\r\ncorner in double columns:--\r\n\r\n    \"THE CONDITIONS.\r\n\r\n    \"Sad soul, long harboring fears and woes\r\n      Within a haunted breast.\r\n    Haste but to meet your lowly Lord,\r\n      And he shall give you rest.\r\n\r\n    \"Into his commonwealth alike\r\n      Are ills and blessings thrown.\r\n    Bear you your neighbors' loads; and\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"Yield only up His price, your heart,\r\n      Into God's loving hold,--\r\n    He turns with heavenly alchemy\r\n      Your lead of life to gold.\r\n\r\n    \"Some needful pangs endure in peace,\r\n      Nor yet for freedom pant,--\r\n    He cuts the bane you cleave to off,\r\n      Then ...\"\r\n\r\nThe rest was torn away. \"'And,'\" repeated I, impatiently,--\"'Then'!\r\n'_And_--_then_'--what?\" There was no answer, or at least I heard none;\r\nbut the verses, so far as they went, struck my excited fancy as a kind\r\nof preternatural confirmation of the faint outline of life and duty\r\nwhich I had been sketching. I marked the date of the day upon the white\r\nmargin with my pencil, and took the paper with me as a memento of the\r\ntime and place, trimmed its torn edges carefully, and laid it in Fanny's\r\nlittle Bible.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, at breakfast, Dr. Physick said: \"You did me a good\r\noffice, Katy, by singing me to sleepiness last night. I was as tired as\r\na dog,--no, as a whole pack of Esquimaux dogs,--and, instead of lying\r\nawake and saying to myself, every time I turned over, 'What in this wide\r\nworld am I ever going to do with that poor little Nelly Fader?' I only\r\nrepeated, whenever I came to myself a little, 'Nelly Bligh shuts her eye\r\nwhen she goes to sleep'; and then I followed her example.\"\r\n\r\n\"I only wish,\" said I, \"that there was any good office beside that I\r\ncould do you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, now I think of it, there is one that I should be very much\r\nobliged to you to do, to me and Nelly Fader besides. I've got to hurry\r\noff in the direction opposite to her Uncle Wardour's; and you talked of\r\nwalking. Take this paper. Empty it into a wine-bottle. Fill it up with\r\nspring-water. Cork it. Gum these directions on it. Take them to Nelly.\r\nRead them to her, and make her understand them if you can, and follow\r\nthem, which I can't. I happen to have a better sample of the drug than\r\nis often in the market; and she may as well have the benefit of it. Her\r\naunt's a goose, and she's a baby. But, as she's likely to be a suffering\r\nbaby for some time to come, we must try to have patience, and take extra\r\npains with her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is she going to die?\" asked I, anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"No, no! I've no idea she is. No such good luck, poor little victim!\r\n'_Only_ nervous,' as people say. I can't find out that there's much else\r\nthe matter. I utterly hate these cases. She ought to be under the care\r\nof a sensible woman; and if there only was such a one in the profession,\r\nI'd guarantee her her hands full of patients out of my practice alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"A female physician!\" cried I, in horror.\r\n\r\n\"O Phil! what will you say next?\" exclaimed his wife, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"Well, only wait till you're a male physician, then, and see,\" returned\r\nhe, jumping into his chaise, and relieving his own nerves with a crack\r\nof the whip, which put new vivacity into those of De Quincey.\r\n\r\nI made ready at once, for the day was sulky. It had been weeping, and\r\nhad not yet begun to smile.\r\n\r\nNelly lived with her uncle, the apothecary, Mr. Wardour, and his widowed\r\nsister, Mrs. Cumberland. As I neared the door, I heard her voice, which\r\nwas not dulcet, from the parlor-kitchen: \"What's this here winder open\r\nfor?\"\r\n\r\n\"It felt so close in here,\" was the plaintive little answer; \"and the\r\nDoctor said I ought to have the air.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does he think we can afford wood enough to warm all out-doors with?\"\r\n\r\nI knocked; but Mrs. Cumberland was deaf, and went on: \"My sakes alive,\r\nchild! what's all this?\"\r\n\r\n\"The stewed damsons.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Stewed damsons,' indeed!--Stewed stalks and stewed leaves and stewed\r\ncreaturs! Didn't you have faculty of yourself enough to know that they'd\r\ngot to be picked over before they went into the pot? There, there,\r\nchild! don't you go to cryin', whatever you do.\"\r\n\r\nI knocked louder.\r\n\r\n\"There's somebody to the door; mebbe it's the Doctor. You go and see\r\nwhat's wanted, an' don't take no more concern about these. I'll see to\r\n'em.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a little delay, occasioned perhaps by the need of rubbing the\r\neyelids, which were red, a little pallid lass, apparently about sixteen\r\nyears old, shyly opened the door, and looked relieved, I thought, to\r\nfind only me at it. She had a small and pretty nose and mouth, large,\r\nheavy blue eyes, flaxen hair drawn neatly, but unbecomingly, away from\r\nher face, looked modest and refined, but sadly moped, and was dressed in\r\ndark green, which set her off much as spinach does a _dropped_ egg.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Nelly?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Miss Morne,\" said she.\r\n\r\nI had never seen her before; but it afterwards came out that she had\r\npeeped at me through the blinds of her chamber.\r\n\r\n\"I have brought you a little treat from Dr. Physick.\"\r\n\r\n\"O,\" said she, looking rather pleased; \"then isn't he coming to-day?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; he sent me instead.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad to see you,\" said she, timidly, but beginning to look really\r\npretty, as her countenance went on brightening. \"Won't you walk in?\"\r\n\r\nI did so, sat down opposite to her in the cold, shaded \"best parlor,\"\r\nand went over the directions to her aloud. She kept her face civilly\r\nturned towards me; but it grew utterly blank again, and I saw she was\r\nnot paying the least attention. So I played her a genuine teacher's\r\ntrick, which I had learned in my school-room. \"Now,\" continued I, \"will\r\nyou be so good as to repeat to me what I have been saying, so that I may\r\nbe able to tell Dr. Physick that I explained it to you perfectly? He was\r\nrather _particular_ about it.\"\r\n\r\nOf course she could not; but this obliged her, in common courtesy, to\r\nlisten the second time, which was all I wanted. Then I rose.\r\n\r\nShe went with me to the door, saying, \"I am sorry to give so much\r\ntrouble. You are very kind to take so much for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be a 'joyful trouble,' if it does you good.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are very kind to me. Do you like roses?\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed I do. Do not you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. I used to.\"\r\n\r\nThere were three blossoms and one bud on a monthly rose-bush, which\r\nstood in an earthen pot by the front door. In an instant she had\r\ngathered them all, in spite of my protestations. She added two or three\r\nfrom a heliotrope, and the freshest sprigs from a diosma, a myrtle, and\r\na geranium, all somewhat languishing, and tied them together for me with\r\na long blade of grass.\r\n\r\n\"It is plain,\" said I, as I thanked her, \"that you still care enough\r\nabout flowers to arrange them most sweetly. These look as if they were\r\nsitting for their picture. I should like to paint them just as they\r\nare.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you paint?\"\r\n\r\n\"A little. Cannot you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I can't do anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall we make a bargain, then?\" I ventured to say, as she looked and\r\nseemed so much like the poor baby the Doctor had called her. \"We will\r\neach of us try to do something for the other. If I succeed in painting\r\nyour flowers, and you succeed in following your directions, you shall\r\nhave the picture.\"\r\n\r\nShe blushed deeply, looked half ashamed and half gratified, but\r\naltogether more alive than she had done till now, and finally managed to\r\nstammer out: \"It's too good an offer--too kind--to refuse; but it's more\r\nthan I deserve, a great deal. So I'll try to mind Dr. Physick, to please\r\nyou; and then--if you _liked_ to give me the picture, I should prize it\r\nvery much.\"\r\n\r\nI nodded, laughed, went home, put the flowers in water on Julia's\r\nwork-table, read to her, and went into the heart of the town to do some\r\nshopping for her. After our early dinner, I said I was a little tired;\r\nand she drove with her husband. I took out my paper, brushes, and\r\npalette, set Nelly's nosegay in a becoming light, and began to rub my\r\npaints; when wheels and hoofs came near and stopped, and presently the\r\ndoor-bell rang.\r\n\r\n\"Are the ladies at home?\" asked a smooth, silvery, feminine voice, with\r\na peculiarly neat, but unaffected enunciation.\r\n\r\n\"No'm, he ain't,\" returned the portress, mechanically; \"an' he's druv\r\nMissis out, too. Here's the slate; or Miss Kitty could take a message, I\r\ns'pose, without she's went out lately ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take this card,\" resumed the first voice, \"if you please, to Miss\r\nMorne, and say that, if she is not engaged, I should be glad to see\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\nI rose in some confusion, pushed my little table into the darkest corner\r\nof the room, received the white card from Rosanna's pink paw, in which\r\nit lay like cream amidst five half-ripe Hovey's seedlings, read \"Miss\r\nDudley\" upon it, told Rosanna to ask her to please to walk in, and took\r\nup my position just within the door, in a state of some palpitation.\r\n\r\nIn another minute a gray-haired, rather tall and slight, and very\r\nwell-made lady, with delicate, regular, spirited features, was before\r\nme, telling me with a peculiar kind of earnest cordiality, and a\r\nsympathy that expressed itself fully in tones, though not in words, that\r\nshe could not content herself with writing her acknowledgments to me;\r\nshe must come and see me herself, to tell me how pleased and gratified\r\nand touched she was by the offering that I had sent her.\r\n\r\nI felt myself too much moved by the associations connected with it, and\r\ncalled up by her, to answer readily; and she, as if conjecturing this,\r\nled the conversation gently off, at first to painting in general, and\r\nafterwards, as I grew more at my ease with her, back again, with an\r\nappearance of genuine interest, to mine.\r\n\r\n\"There was one little shell,\" said she, \"in your native group, which was\r\nquite new to me, and--which is more remarkable--to my brother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was it like this?\" asked I, taking a specimen from my paint-box.\r\n\r\n\"Precisely. We felt sure the portrait must be true to life, because all\r\nits companions were such faithful likenesses; and then it had itself\r\nsuch an honest, genuine, individual look. But is it to be found on this\r\ncoast?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. If Mr. Dudley has not met with it, it must no doubt be very rare;\r\nbut, near the same spot always, just beyond Cedar Point, under the rocks\r\nin the little cove that lies farthest to the south, I have found it more\r\nthan once.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must be quite an enthusiast in natural history. Have you studied it\r\nlong?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, ma'am, never. I mean,\" continued I, answering her look of surprise,\r\n\"never from books. I believe I should enjoy it more than any other\r\nstudy; but I know so little yet of other things, and there are so many\r\nother things that one needs more to know.\" I felt my cheeks burn; for no\r\nsooner was I helplessly launched into this speech, than I perceived what\r\nan awkward one it was to make to the sister of an eminent naturalist.\r\nNotwithstanding, as I thought it was true, I could not take it back.\r\n\r\n\"I agree with you entirely,\" said she with a reassuring smile. \"Such\r\nstudies are fitted much more for the coping-stones than the\r\nfoundation-stones of a good education. But then, if you will not think\r\nme too inquisitive, pray let me ask you one thing more; and that is,\r\nwhere and how you came by all the information that that group showed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only by playing on the beaches and in the woods when I was a child. My\r\nmother did not like to keep me in, because she thought that that had\r\nimpaired my sister\"--here my voice _would_ break, but I _would_ go\r\non,--Fanny's dear name should not die out of memory while I lived--\"my\r\nsister Fanny's health; but they were afraid to let me run quite wild,\r\nand so she--my sister--led me out often wherever I wished to go, and\r\nhelped me fill a little pasteboard museum which she made for me.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Dudley's large, soft, trusty brown eyes met mine tenderly, as she\r\nsaid: \"These things must indeed possess a more than common interest for\r\nyou then. Have you that museum now?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, ma'am; I sometimes wish I had. I gave it away when I went to\r\nGreenville _to keep school_,\" I added; not that I supposed it would\r\nmatter anything to her, but that I thought it just as well to make sure\r\nof her understanding my position in life.\r\n\r\n\"That is so natural to us all,--to part with these little relics when we\r\nare still very young, and then to wish them back again before we are\r\nmuch older! You would smile to see a little museum that I keep for my\r\nbrother,--not his scientific collection, which I hope some day to have\r\nthe pleasure of showing you,--but 'an _olla podrida_ in an ancestral\r\nwardrobe,' as my little Paul calls it, of his and my two little nieces'\r\nfirst baby-shoes, rattles, corals, and bells, wooden horses, primers,\r\npicture-books, and so forth, down to the cups and balls, and copy-books,\r\nwhich they have cast off within a month or two, each labelled with the\r\nowner's name, and the date of deposit. No year goes by without leaving\r\nbehind some memento of each of them, or even without my laying aside\r\nthere some trifling articles of dress that they have worn. It is a fancy\r\nof my brother's. He says that others may claim their after-years, but\r\ntheir childhood is his own,--all of it that is not mine,--and he must\r\nkeep it for himself, and for them when they come back to visit him in\r\nhis old age. It is a birthday treat to them already to take the key from\r\nmy split-ring, and look together over the half-forgotten things. But\r\nthere is one thing there--a manuscript on the topmost shelf--which they\r\ndo not know about, but which we take out and laugh over sometimes when\r\nthey are all in bed,--a record that I have kept of all the most\r\ndiverting things which we have heard them say, ever since they began to\r\nlearn to talk.\" She checked herself,--I fancied because she remembered\r\nthat, in her enthusiasm about the children, she had forgotten to what a\r\nnew acquaintance she was speaking. She rose to take leave, and resumed,\r\nshaking hands with me cordially,--she had, I observed, a remarkably\r\ncordial and pleasant, earnest way of shaking hands,--\"But upon the\r\nsubject of my museum, Miss Morne, I need hardly beg you to be more\r\ndiscreet than I, and not to mention a domestic trifle of so little\r\ngeneral interest.\"\r\n\r\nI could only bow, but longed, as I attended her to the door, to assure\r\nher of the particular interest which I had already begun to feel in\r\nevery trifle which belonged to her.\r\n\r\nHer little barouche, and long-tailed, dark-gray ponies, vanished with\r\nher down the road; and I was left walking up and down the room. The\r\n\"kind o' poor-lookin', pale-lookin', queer-lookin' lady,\" that Miss\r\nMehitable had described,--was this she? How are we ever to know people\r\nby descriptions, when the same person produces one impression on one\r\nmind and quite another on another,--nay, may have one set of inherent\r\nqualities brought out by contact with one character, and quite another\r\nset by contact with another character? Have _I_ described Miss Dudley?\r\nNo,--and I cannot. She was both _unique_ and indescribable.\r\n\r\nMost people impress us more, perhaps, by their outward and physical,\r\nthan by their inward and psychical life. On a first interview with them,\r\nespecially, we receive an impression of clothes, good or otherwise, of\r\nbeauty or plainness or ugliness of feature, and of correctness or\r\nuncouthness of manner. These are the common people, whether ladies and\r\ngentlemen, or simple men and women. There are, however, others, in all\r\nranks and conditions, so instinct and replete with spirit, that we\r\nchiefly feel, when they have come in our way, that a spirit has passed\r\nby,--that a new life has been brought in contact with our own life.\r\n\r\nOf these was Miss Dudley. But because, ever since the day I write of, I\r\nhave loved to think of her, and because I know that, when I rejoin her,\r\nI shall leave some behind me who will still love, and have a right to\r\nhear of her, I will indulge myself in saying something more. That\r\nsomething shall be what I said to myself then, as I promenaded to and\r\nfro,--that bodily exercise was one of my safety-valves in those\r\ntimes,--in the endeavor to work off so much of my superfluous animation\r\nas to be in a state to sit down and paint again; and thus I spake: \"I\r\nmust have had before me an uncommonly fine specimen of a class whose\r\nexistence I have conjectured before, but by no means including all the\r\nwealthy, who wear their purple and fine linen both gracefully and\r\ngraciously, fare not more sumptuously than temperately every day, and do\r\na great deal, not only directly by their ready beneficence, but\r\nindirectly by their sunny benignity, to light up the gloomy world of\r\nLazarus.\" And though I was but a budding theorist in human nature, and\r\noften made mistakes before and afterwards, I never found myself mistaken\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nWhen Julia came in an hour after, she said to me, as I looked up from my\r\nroses and my rose-colored revery, \"Katy, you look like an inspired\r\nsibyl! What has come over you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Dudley,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"What! has she really--been here? How I wish I had seen her! What did\r\nshe wear?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid I can't tell you. Wait, I will try. O yes! it comes back to\r\nme;--a silver-gray _shot_ poplin, or silk, made full, but, I think,\r\nquite plain; a large red Cashmere shawl, rather more crimson and less\r\nscarlet than they usually are,--it glowed gloriously out from the\r\ngray;--then some kind of a thin, gray bonnet, with large gray and\r\ncrimson crape and velvet flowers in it,--hibiscus or passion-flowers, or\r\nreally I don't know what,--that seemed just to marry the dress to the\r\nshawl.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pretty well for you, Katy! Rather heavy for the season; but I suppose\r\nshe was afraid of this east wind. You liked her, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very much.\"\r\n\r\n\"So does the Doctor, always. Some people call her proud; but he says,\r\nthat is only their way of expressing their view of the fact that she has\r\na good deal to make her so, and more than enough to make them so, if\r\nthey had it instead of her.\"\r\n\r\n\"I dare say. I should not think she was a person to take liberties with;\r\nbut she was very sweet and kind to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are not a person to take liberties with anybody, nor to have any\r\ntaken with you; and so _I_ dare say she recognized a kindred spirit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Julia, by your paying me such a compliment as that, I am certain\r\nyou must want to have your bonnet taken up stairs for you; and so you\r\nshall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! now I shall always know what string to pull when I wish to put a\r\nskilful attendant in motion. Phil would take my bonnet up stairs for me\r\nin a moment, if I bade him; but when I went up myself after it, it would\r\nbe sure to stare me in the face, topsy-turvy, _dumped_ bolt upright on\r\nthe feather.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nIn another fortnight we had another Physick in the family. His papa\r\ncalled him \"a little dose,\" and his mamma a \"pill,\" in contradistinction\r\nto her previous \"Phil.\" Proving peaceful and reflective, he also soon\r\nearned for himself the title of \"the infant _Phil_osopher.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Physick did not like the society of Mrs. Rocket, the nurse, whom\r\nthe Doctor had chosen \"on account of the _absence_ of her conversational\r\npowers.\" Mrs. Physick was accordingly always trying to get me into her\r\nchamber to sit with her. Mrs. Rocket accordingly did not like me, and\r\nwas always trying to get me out. Between these two contending powers\r\nabove, and the butcher, the baker, and candlestick-maker below, I was\r\nneither solitary nor idle.\r\n\r\nThere was much to do, moreover, in answering the kind inquiries, and\r\nreceiving and disposing of the whips, jellies, _blanc-mangers_, and\r\nother indigestible delicacies, sent in by anxious friends. These the\r\ngrateful Doctor pronounced, in the privacy of domestic life, \"poison for\r\nthe patient, but not quite so bad for the attendants.\" Accordingly, we\r\nate them together sociably, at almost every meal; after which we went up\r\nstairs and told \"the patient\" how good they were, while I presented her\r\ngruel, and he would ask her, with an earnest air of judicial and\r\ndispassionate investigation, whether that was not \"nice.\" This conduct\r\nshe declared most unfeeling and ungrateful in us both, and bound herself\r\nby many a vow to make us pay for it as soon as she had the ordering of\r\nour dinners again. So we all made merry together over the little cradle\r\nthat was called \"the pill-box.\" Its small tenant was from the first, as\r\nI have hinted, a virtuous child, cried little, slept much, and when\r\nawake rewarded our attentions by making such preposterous faces as\r\nrendered it a most grateful task to watch him. I soon, therefore, became\r\nmuch attached to him; and I enjoyed one at least of the chief elements\r\nof the happiness of the individual,--the happiness of those among whom\r\nthe individual lives.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time my guardian sometimes discussed with me some other\r\nthings besides the jellies. For instance, \"Katy,\" said he at one of our\r\n_tête-à-tête_ dinners, \"you walk out every day, I suppose; or, at least,\r\nyou ought. I wish you would call now and then, and take Nelly Fader with\r\nyou. She can hardly be a very entertaining companion to you, I own, but\r\nit would be a charity; and, for your mother's daughter, that's enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly I will. By the way, speaking of her, what _did_ you mean by\r\nwhat you said that day about female physicians?\"\r\n\r\n\"I meant what I said,\" returned he, bluntly. \"I meant just what I said.\r\nWe need them, and we shall have them. It is an experiment that has got\r\nto be tried, and will be probably, within your lifetime, if not in mine.\r\nI don't want you to be one of them, though. You ought to be as much\r\ncleverer than yourself as you are now than Nelly Fader, in order to\r\ncarry it through; and even then it might be the carrying of a cross\r\nthrough life,--a grievous, in the view of most men perhaps an\r\nignominious cross, to the pioneers. Especially it will be so, if other\r\ngood but uninformed and thoughtless women are going to cry out upon it,\r\nas you and Julia did the other day. Whether the experiment is to succeed\r\nor not depends, under Providence, very much on you and such as you. But\r\nif that sort of outcry is to be raised, it will probably have the effect\r\nof keeping out of the profession such women as, from their integrity,\r\nability, culture, and breeding, could be ornaments to it, and leave us\r\nshallow and low-minded smatterers, that I wouldn't trust with the life\r\nof a canary-bird,--who will ask which is likely to be the most lucrative\r\ncalling, medicine or millinery, and take their choice accordingly,--and,\r\nfor want of better, poor dupes will employ them. If you can't bear\r\nfemale practitioners, you'll have to bear female _quack_titioners.\" He\r\npaused and looked at me.\r\n\r\nI knew how jealous he always was for the honor of his craft. He did not\r\noften come so near giving me a scolding; and I began to be afraid I\r\nmight deserve one, though I could not see how. \"I am sorry,\" said I; \"I\r\ndid not mean--I did not think--I did not know--\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely, kitten on the hearth,\" returned he, good-humoredly; \"and as\r\nyou _are_ sorry, and as you are besides usually rather less unmeaning\r\nand unthinking and unknowing than most other chits of your age, I\r\nforgive you. Learn to think and know before you hiss or purr, and you\r\nwill be wiser than most chits of any age or sex. But now, consider: you,\r\nsuch as you are, yourself little more than a child, have, in two or\r\nthree short visits, roused, interested, and done that other poor child\r\nmore good, and, I strongly suspect, inspired her with more confidence,\r\nthan I--I trust as upright a person and as sincere a well-wisher--have\r\nbeen able to do in a score. And this you have been able to do, in great\r\npart, simply by virtue of your womanhood. It _comes more natural_ to\r\nher, no doubt, to talk with you. Nelly's is a case in point, though by\r\nno manner of means so strong a case as others that I have in my mind.\r\nNow imagine another woman with your good-will and natural tact,\r\nvivacity, and sympathy; multiply these by double your age and intellect,\r\nand again by triple your experience and information; calculate from\r\nthese data _her_ powers of doing good in such cases, and then see\r\nwhether, in helping to brand her and fetter her in the exercise of such\r\npowers, you may not 'haply be found to fight against God.'\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not speak so again,--at least before I think and know. You have\r\nforgiven me. Now appoint me my penance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do what more you can for Nelly, then. I can do little or nothing. In\r\nfact, my visits seem to embarrass and agitate her so much, that I am\r\nsometimes afraid they hurt her more than they help her. She suffers more\r\nin mind than body, I suspect. How, she will not tell me, and perhaps she\r\ncannot. It may be that she is sick from sorrow; or, on the other hand,\r\nher sorrow may be only an illusion of her sickness. It is all, from\r\nfirst to last, a mere miserable groping and working in the dark. In the\r\nmean time her constitution and character are forming for life. It is\r\nenough to make one's heart ache to look at the poor baby, and think what\r\nan unsatisfactory, profitless, miserable life that may be. I need not\r\nremind _you_, Katy, that all this is a little piece of Freemasonry\r\nbetween ourselves. You are one of the exceptional and abnormal human\r\npeople before whom one can safely think aloud.\"\r\n\r\nI went to Nelly that very afternoon, with some curiosity and with no\r\nunwillingness. I had already begun to like her better than the Doctor\r\ndid, as I began to know her better. At first I had been somewhat at a\r\nloss as to her real disposition, between the constant civility of her\r\nmanners, and the occasional sullenness of her _manner_. I was fast\r\nmaking up my mind that the civility was genuine; the sullenness,\r\napparent only, the result of extreme shyness, despondency, and languor.\r\nAs fast as she became more and more at her ease with me, just so fast\r\ndid she become more and more engaging. She was chaotic enough, and like\r\na different creature on different days; but I found her, though\r\nsometimes very childish, often sweet and never sour, unvaryingly patient\r\ntowards her very trying aunt, and only too subservient to her.\r\n\r\nOn this particular afternoon, I spied her through the best-parlor\r\nwindow, sobbing dismally. When she heard and saw me, she tried to\r\ncompose herself in vain; but the only account she had to give of her\r\ngrief was, that \"the mocking-bird sang so dreadfully, and the Doctor\r\ntold Aunt Cumberland she [Nelly] was not going to die. There,\" added\r\nshe, under her breath, \"I didn't mean to say that!\"\r\n\r\nWe had no chance to say more; for Mrs. Cumberland came in from her\r\nshopping, and inquired for some cap-ruffles, which she had given Nelly\r\nto make up for her. \"She said she didn't feel well enough to go down\r\ntown with me,\" said Mrs. Cumberland; \"an' so I left her them to hem,\r\n'cause the Doctor says she needs cheerful occupation; an' them are just\r\nthe pootiest kind o' work for young ladies, an' ruther tryin' to old\r\neyes.\"\r\n\r\nThis was unanswerable; and as I was obliged myself to go to some shops,\r\nand Nelly could not, with her swollen lids, I bade Mrs. Cumberland good\r\nby; but told her niece that I meant to call for her soon again, for the\r\nDoctor thought it would do both of us good to take a walk every day. She\r\nlooked somewhat encouraged by this; and I hoped that the plan would have\r\nthe twofold effect of making her think it would be ungracious to refuse\r\nto accompany me a second time, and of keeping her from crying lest she\r\nshould again be caught at it.\r\n\r\nWhen I reached home, I found it a home of strife. The _pill_ was soon to\r\nbe labelled. Dr. Physick wished to call it Julius; but nothing would do\r\nfor his tyrannical wife but to have it bear his name.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" said the Doctor, as I entered. \"Aren't the sufferings of\r\none generation under that dispensation enough for you? Do as you would\r\nbe done by, Julia. How would you like yourself to be called Philemon?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't help that,\" persisted Mrs. Julia. \"The name of Phil is a\r\nphilter to me. Unless he bears it, I shall hate him.\"\r\n\r\n\"A likely story! What should you have done if he had been a girl?\"\r\n\r\n\"Called him Phillis,\" answered the ready Julia, sturdily.\r\n\r\n\"Then what should you say to Philip, now?\" interposed I in behalf of the\r\nhelpless innocent,--(an interposition in return for which, ever after we\r\nhave finished his medical education with a year in Paris, he ought in\r\ncommon gratitude to prescribe for me _gratis_, if I live to be as old\r\nand ill as Joyce Heth;--for Philip he was and is, and will be, I trust,\r\nfor many a fine day,--the fine, honest, clever, useful fellow!)\r\n\r\n\"Here's your fee, Katy, for restoring my domestic supremacy--ahem! I\r\nhope Mrs. Physick did not hear,\" said the Doctor;--\"domestic balance of\r\npower shall I say, my love,--or system of compromises?\"\r\n\r\nWhat \"my love\" desired him to say I cannot say, for I was deep in the\r\nnote which he had disgorged for me from his not only omnivorous, but,\r\nalas! too often oblivious pocket. It was written on small-sized French\r\npaper, in a beautiful English hand, bore date, to my consternation, some\r\ndays back, and ran as follows:--\r\n\r\n                    \"BARBERRY BEACH, Monday, Sept.--th, 18--.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR MISS MORNE:--\r\n\r\n\"I have been wishing to see you again, all through this month, but\r\nscarcely expecting it till now; because I knew how full your heart and\r\nhands must be at home. Now, however, since I have had the pleasure of\r\nhearing from the Doctor that Mrs. Physick is nearly well, perhaps it\r\nwill not be too much to hope that you will find an hour to spare for me\r\nsome day this week. I have no engagements made; and if you can appoint a\r\ntime to come to me, I shall be here and deny myself to other visitors. I\r\nshould send my barouche for you; but one of the ponies has hurt its\r\nhoof, and the Doctor says that you confine yourself too closely to your\r\nhousehold cares, and that you would be all the better for a walk.\r\n\r\n\"Another indulgence which I have been promising myself,--that of\r\npainting some illustrations for my brother's next work,--I find I must\r\nnot only put off, but forego. It would be some consolation to me to be\r\nable to make it over to you, and believe that you found half as much\r\nenjoyment in it as I have, on former occasions. The usual terms, when he\r\nhas paid for such work, have been ... [here she named a liberal sum];\r\nbut of course, if you like to undertake it, you will feel at liberty to\r\nname your own; and I shall be, as I am,\r\n\r\n                                \"Very gratefully yours,\r\n\r\n                                    \"ELIZABETH DUDLEY.\r\n\r\n   \"MISS MORNE.\"\r\n\r\nBetween surprise, pleasure, and dismay at my apparent neglect, I\r\nexclaimed simply, \"What shall I do!\"\r\n\r\n\"In all dilemmas, consult your guardian,\" answered he; and I handed him\r\nthe note by way of a Nemesis.\r\n\r\nHe read it aloud very honestly, date and all; and I had the satisfaction\r\nto hear his wife, who was fast getting him well in hand again, rebuke\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Whew!\" whistled he with most appropriate contrition; \"'Monday'! and\r\nit's Thursday now, and too late for to-day! I wish I mayn't have lost\r\nyou the job, Katy. While the heart holds out, however, never give up the\r\ncase! Put on your best bib and tucker when you get up to-morrow morning;\r\nand, as soon as you have got through ordering me an apple-dumpling, I\r\nwill take you over there, and tell Miss Dudley who was to blame, and\r\npromise her, if she will forgive us, never to give her any\r\nassafoetida.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nI could scarcely sleep that night for eagerness and anticipation. Ever\r\nsince the afternoon when the vision of Miss Dudley appeared, to startle\r\nme from my painting, in the little south parlor, she had been the\r\nforemost figure in my brightest day-dreams, as often as, with little\r\nPhilip warm and slumberous on my knees, I could find time for\r\nday-dreams. Accordingly, I had been more than wishing--longing--to see\r\nher again; though I put off returning her visit, partly from real want\r\nof time, partly from uncertainty about what was the proper etiquette for\r\nme, and partly from the dread of dispelling some pleasant illusions, and\r\nfinding that the Miss Dudley of my reveries belonged to the realm of my\r\nimagination rather than to that of my memory. I dreamed of her all that\r\nnight, when I was not lying awake to think of her; and when, in the\r\nmorning, I arose early to brush and brighten my somewhat faded black,\r\nthe keen autumn air, instead of chilling me, seemed but to whet and\r\nsharpen my zest for my expedition.\r\n\r\nJulia's toilet was not made when I heard the clatter of the recalcitrant\r\nDe Quincey backing the chaise out of his beloved, but little _be-lived_\r\nin, stable. She sat up in bed, however, when I went in to kiss her, in\r\nspite of Mrs. Rocket, turned me round to the window to see whether I\r\nwas looking my best, or, as she equivocally phrased it, \"the best of\r\nwhich I was capable,\" told me, that I had got a little _rouge_ the last\r\ntime I was out, and must ask Miss Dudley whether it was not becoming,\r\nand hooked her forefingers into my naturally _gekräuseltes_ hair, to\r\npull it into what she always maintained to be the proper _pose_ above my\r\neyebrows.\r\n\r\nThen down I ran, and off I went, through the town and along the road,\r\nbetween rocks and evergreens with here and there a gate among them that\r\nmarked the entrance to the earthly paradise of some lucky gentleman.\r\n\r\n\"Sha'n't we be too early?\" asked I, fidgeting, for my prosperity\r\nappeared to me, just now, too perfect to be permanent.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the Doctor. \"They are early people at Barberry Beach,--not\r\nSybarites in anything, so far as I can judge. It is near nine. Miss\r\nDudley tells me I shall almost always find her visible by that time. If,\r\nnot hearing from you, she has made other engagements, you know she is\r\nmore likely to be at leisure now than later.\"\r\n\r\n\"She does not look well yet. What was the matter with her?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Angina pectoris_. That is Greek to you, Katy. Pain in the heart,\r\nthen.\"\r\n\r\n\"What made her have it?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a deep question in the most interesting of sciences,--that of\r\nthe metamorphoses of diseases. Many men would answer it according to\r\ntheir many minds. To the best of my belief, the cause of Miss Dudley's\r\nhaving a pain in her heart lay in her great-grandfather's toe.\"\r\n\r\n\"O Doctor! what _do_ you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"The gout.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that sounds very aristocratic and imposing; but, notwithstanding,\r\nI know you are laughing at me.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I am not. It is no laughing matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, is it dangerous?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dangerous!\" said he. \"It is deadly. Why, Katy, I never shall dare to\r\ntell you anything again, if you are going to look so frightened! _She_\r\ndid not when I told her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does she know?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and makes no secret of it, and is not unlikely to mention it\r\nbefore you; so that you must accustom yourself to the idea, and be\r\nprepared to face it as she does.\"\r\n\r\n\"How came she to know?\"\r\n\r\n\"She asked me. I gave up very early in my practice, for several reasons,\r\nthe habit of lying to my patients. If they are cowards, or if, for any\r\nreason, I think the truth and the whole truth would shorten their days,\r\nI often tell them little or nothing; but I tell them nothing but the\r\ntruth. She is not a person to be put off from knowing what she has a\r\nright to know.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did she take it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nobly and simply, without any affectation of indifference. As she put\r\nthe question, I laid my hand on her pulse; and, as it went on pretty\r\nfirmly, I went on too. When I had said all there was to say, she thanked\r\nme earnestly, and said, as sweetly as anything could possibly be said,\r\nthat the information would add double weight to the cautions and other\r\ncounsels I had given her, and told me that, if I ever came to be in a\r\nsituation like hers, she trusted that I should find the comfort of being\r\ndealt with with candor and kindness like mine. After all, Katy, she may\r\nlive yet many years, and die at last of something else; and that is\r\nabout the best that can be prognosticated of you and me, my dear.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Tis true the young _may_ die, but the old must,\" thought I. I was half\r\ncomforted, and only half. Yet the pensive shadow of coming doom--or\r\nshall I not rather say the solemn dawn of approaching eternity?--seemed\r\nto lend a new and more unearthly charm to the lovely spiritual vision I\r\ncherished in my mind.\r\n\r\nPresently, instead of passing a gate, the Doctor turned in at it, and\r\ndrove smoothly up the gentle slope of a hard-rolled winding avenue lined\r\nwith hemlocks. \"Pretty, isn't it?\" cried he. \"O for the time when I\r\nshall retire upon my fortune, and leave my office to Phil the second!\r\nThere, Katy! What do you think of that?\"\r\n\r\nWhat did I think? O, too much to be told, either then or now! From the\r\ndark trees one forward step of each of De Quincey's forefeet brought us\r\nout into a high amphitheatre, at the instant flooded with sunshine. A\r\nhigher hill, wooded with evergreens and bossed with boulders, made a\r\nbackground behind it, on the right, for a large, low cottage of clear\r\ngray granite, with broad piazzas curtained with Virginia creepers and\r\nmonthly honeysuckles, and cloistered on the south. In front of the\r\ncottage was a shaven lawn, rimmed with a hedge of graceful barberries,\r\nand lighted up by small circular spots of brown earth, teeming with\r\nsalvia and other splendid autumn flowers. Beyond and on the left ran a\r\nlong reach of rocky headlands, burning with golden-rod and wild-rose\r\nberries mingled with purple asters and white spiræa, and all along from\r\nbelow, but very near, spread out far and wide the inexpressible ocean.\r\nIt was a rough, ridgy, sage-greenish, gray ocean, I remember, that\r\nmorning, full of tumble and toss and long scalloped lines of spent foam,\r\ncovered over with a dim, low half-dome of sky,--with seagulls\r\nflickering, and here and there a small, wild, ragged gypsy of a cloud,\r\nof a little darker gray, scudding lawlessly under,--and threw out in the\r\nstrongest contrast the brilliant hues and sharp, clear outlines of the\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor sprang from the chaise, left me in it, and threw me the\r\nreins. I always wished he wouldn't, but he always would. The most I had\r\nto gain by pulling them, if De Quincey grew restless, was to make him\r\n_back_; and this was precisely what I least desired. My reasonable\r\nexpostulations, however, could never obtain any more grace from him who\r\nshould have been my guardian than a promise, if I would \"make no fuss,\r\nand broken bones\" came of it, that he would \"mend me softly.\" Therefore\r\nI thought it most prudent not to expostulate; but my penance was this\r\ntime a brief one. He had hardly entered the door when the tall, striking\r\nfigure I recollected so well came dimly in view in one of the nearest\r\nbay-windows, tapped on the glass with one slender white-frilled hand,\r\nand nodded with a bright, glad smile; and back came the Doctor to help\r\nme out.\r\n\r\n\"It is all right, Katy. Miss Dudley wants you, and does not want me. If\r\nit rains, you can stay till I call for you. Otherwise, come back when\r\nyou like. The first door to your left in the hall.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Dudley met me in the parlor-door, laughing. \"I should have come out\r\nto make prize of you,\" said she, \"but they say it is rather bleak this\r\nmorning, and I am still under orders. I had almost given you up for this\r\nweek; but the Doctor assures me that he has already been suitably dealt\r\nwith and brought to repentance, and so there is no more to be said on\r\nthat point, especially as you have happened to hit on the very time when\r\nI am most alone, and when, as I have been accustomed to be the busiest,\r\nI feel my present idleness the most. You drove here, after all. You are\r\nnot tired? What should you say, first, to a walk with me?\"\r\n\r\nA staid-looking, exquisitely neat, elderly woman brought her bonnet,\r\numbrella, gloves, and a large Scotch plaid shawl, in which she wrapped\r\nMiss Dudley, with much solicitude, and was so prettily thanked for her\r\npains that I longed to have the wrapping up to do myself.\r\n\r\n\"I really do not think I needed to be muffled up quite so closely\r\nto-day,\" said my hostess, as she stepped lightly from the piazza to the\r\nsunlit gravel-walk; \"but Bonner is ten years older than I, and feels the\r\ncold a good deal herself, and I do not like to make her anxious about\r\nme. She had a great fright, poor thing! when I was ill. Where shall we\r\ngo, Miss Morne?--to the garden or the shore? I am not certain that those\r\nclouds mean to give us time for both.\"\r\n\r\nNot knowing which she would prefer, I answered that I could hardly\r\nchoose, unless she would be so kind as to tell me which was the most\r\nbeautiful. To my joy, she said the shore. The path ran close to the\r\nedge of the cliffs; and below our very feet were the beach and the\r\nbreakers. We both forgot ourselves at first, I think, in the sight and\r\nsound.\r\n\r\nAt length she turned, with a sudden movement, and looked me in the face.\r\n\"I do believe, Miss Morne,\" said she, \"that you are one of the fortunate\r\npeople who have the power to enjoy this to the full. I trust that we may\r\noften still enjoy it here together.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall I tell you how I enjoy it, ma'am?\" I exclaimed, carried out of\r\nmyself at sight of the enthusiasm that was tinging her delicate cheek\r\nand lighting up her eyes. \"As we enjoy those things that it never comes\r\ninto our heads to ask ourselves whether we like or not. Some things we\r\n_have_ to ask ourselves, whether we like or not, before we know, and\r\neven after we are scarcely sure; and some things, such as the poor\r\nlittle 'Marchioness's' orange-peel and water, we have to 'make believe\r\nvery hard' in order to like at all. But home when we have been away, and\r\nfriends when we have been lonely, and water when we are thirsty, and the\r\nsea always!--we never ask ourselves if those are good,--we know.\" Then\r\nmy face burnt. How it would burn in those girlish days!\r\n\r\nAnd how foolish I felt, or had begun to feel, when Miss Dudley slowly\r\nanswered, looking mercifully away from me and at the waves: \"Very true,\r\nMiss Morne! You speak from your heart, and to mine.\"\r\n\r\nThe clouds were forbearing, and allowed us time afterwards for a visit\r\nto the gorgeous garden. We walked to the summer-house at the very end,\r\nfrom which a winding path began to climb the hill. There Miss Dudley\r\npaused. \"My chamois days are over, for the present, at least,\" said she.\r\n\"We must wait for my little nieces or nephew to escort you up there.\r\nShall we go in?\"\r\n\r\nWhen we did so, I thought that the interior of the cottage was not much\r\nless grand, scarcely less beautiful, than what we had seen without. At\r\nthat period most housekeepers held the hardly yet exploded heresy, not\r\nonly that fresh air was a dangerous and unwholesome luxury, to be\r\ndenied, as far as might be, to any but the strongest constitutions,[2]\r\nbut that even sunshine within the doors was an inadmissible intrusion,\r\nalike untidy and superfluous. On these points this house set public\r\nopinion at defiance. It was set, of set purpose, at _wrong_ angles to\r\nthe points of the compass. Every wind of heaven could sweep it, at the\r\npleasure of the inmates, through and through, and the piazzas were so\r\narranged that there was not a single apartment in it into which the sun\r\ncould not look, through one window or another, once at least in the\r\ntwenty-four hours. The floors were tiled, ingrained, oiled,\r\nmatted,--everything but carpeted, except that of the state drawing-room;\r\nand there the Wilton had a covering over it, removed, as I afterwards\r\nfound, only on occasions of state. The whole atmosphere seemed full of\r\nhealth, purity, cheerfulness, warmth, and brightness. Brilliant flowers\r\npeeped in at the windows, and were set on the tables in vases, or hung\r\nin them from the walls. And there were pictures, and there were statues,\r\nbut there too was Miss Dudley, paring a peach for me, for sociability's\r\nsake,--for she could not eat one herself, so soon after her breakfast;\r\nand, as I knew the time must be running away very fast,--hard that it\r\nwill always run fastest when we are the happiest!--I seized my first\r\nopportunity to say that few things would give me greater pleasure than\r\nto furnish the illustrations she had mentioned, if I could but succeed\r\nin executing them as I ought.\r\n\r\n\"As to that, I will be your sponsor,\" returned she, gayly, \"if you would\r\nlike to begin them here. Your touch is very firm and true; and I will\r\nshow you all our tricks of color. Here is my paint-box. Have you time\r\nto-day?\"\r\n\r\nI had time, and no excuse; though, in falling so suddenly into the\r\nmidst of painting-lessons from Miss Dudley, I really felt as if I was\r\nhaving greatness thrust upon me in a manner to take my breath away. If I\r\nhad only had a little more time to think about it, my touch might have\r\nbeen truer for the nonce. Her paint-box was so handsomely furnished,\r\ntoo, and so daintily ordered, that I scarcely dared touch it. She gave\r\nme a little respite, however, by rubbing the colors for me,--colors,\r\nsome of them, that, for their costliness, I could not allow myself at\r\nall at home,--and selected for me two such exquisite brushes from her\r\nstore! Then she lay down beside me on a \"couch of Ind,\" smiled as I laid\r\nher plaid over her feet, and watched me at the work. How that brought my\r\npoor Fanny back to me! But my new mistress went on unwearyingly,\r\nteaching and encouraging me, and, if I was more than satisfied with her,\r\ndid not on her part show that she was less than satisfied with me. The\r\nclock struck twelve before I dreamed of its taking upon itself to offer\r\nsuch an untimely interruption.\r\n\r\n\"Now I am nicely rested,\" said she, soon after; \"and I am afraid you\r\nmust begin to be nicely tired. Do you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed; I seldom do till nine o'clock at night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we will indulge ourselves here still a little longer. But hark!\r\nAre not there my little people back from school?\"\r\n\r\nThe expression common to those who love children stole into her face.\r\nYoung voices were drawing nearer.\r\n\r\n\"Come to my arms, O lovely cherub!\" said one that had a boyish sound in\r\nit, paternally.\r\n\r\n\"Look out and see them,\" whispered Miss Dudley to me.\r\n\r\nI peeped through the blinds. A handsome and very graceful olive-hued\r\nboy, apparently about fourteen years old, with a form like that of the\r\nMercury upborne by a zephyr, eyes like stars, lashes like star-beams,\r\nand an expression that would have made him a good study for a picture of\r\nPuck, half leaning, half sitting, on the stone balustrade, was tenderly\r\ndandling in his arms a huge, vulgar-looking, gray, striped stable-cat,\r\nthat rolled and writhed therein in transports of comfort and affection.\r\n\r\n\"But, indeed, Paul,\" remonstrated another voice, _tout comme un serin_,\r\n\"Pet ought to be whipped instead of hugged! Lily says so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tiger Lily? What a cruel girl! O, my Pettitoes! how can she say so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" answered another girlish voice, a little firmer, but hardly less\r\nsweet, than the first, \"only think! While we were all in school, he\r\nwatched his opportunity and killed the robin that lives in the\r\ncrab-apple-tree. The gardener says he heard it cry, and ran with his\r\nhoe; and there was this wicked, horrid, grim, great Pet galloping as\r\nfast as he could gallop to the stable, with its poor little beak\r\nsticking out at one side of his grinning mouth, and its tail at the\r\nother!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Pettitoes! how very inconsiderate! You won't serve it so another\r\ntime, _will_ you? Though how a robin can have the face to squeak when he\r\ncatches it himself at noon, after cramming himself with worms the whole\r\nmorning, is more than I can see!\"\r\n\r\n\"O no, Paul! He was singing most sweetly! I heard him; and so did Rose.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so did I. He was singing through his nose as bad as Deacon Piper,\r\nbecause he had a worm in his mouth. He couldn't leave off gobbling one\r\nsingle minute,--not even to practise his music.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us go out,\" said Miss Dudley.\r\n\r\nWe did so. Paul's retreating back was all that was to be seen of the\r\nboy, with Pet's peaceful chin pillowed upon his shoulder, as, borne off\r\nin triumph, he looked calmly back at Lily, who stood shaking her small,\r\nchiselled ivory finger at him. Rose was still beside her, with her arm\r\naround her waist, as if in propitiation.\r\n\r\nTwo twelve-year-old twins, in twin blue gingham frocks,--they were much\r\naddicted to blue and pink ginghams,--they had that indefinable look of\r\n_blood_ which belonged to their kin, which is sometimes, to be sure, to\r\nbe found in families that have no great-grandfathers, after they have\r\nbeen well-fed, well-read, and well-bred for a generation or two, but to\r\nwhich they had an uncommonly good right, as their pedigree--so I\r\nafterwards found--ran straight back to the Norman Conquest, without a\r\nsingle \"probably\" in it. They were, for their age, tall and slender,\r\nwith yet more springy buoyancy than their aunt in _pose_ and movement.\r\nStrangers were always mistaking them for each other. That day I could\r\nscarcely tell them apart, though afterwards I wondered at it. Rose was\r\nthe very prettiest child I ever saw, and Lily pretty nearly the most\r\nbeautiful person.\r\n\r\nLily was already the tallest. Her thick and wavy hair was _blonde\r\ncendrée_, and all her features were perfectly Grecian. Her eyes were of\r\na very dark blue, that turned into nothing but clear radiance when she\r\nwas opposed or in any way excited. Her complexion was healthful, but\r\nwould be described as soft and warm, rather than brilliant. Her whole\r\nfair little face was about as firm and spirited as a fair girlish face\r\ncould be.\r\n\r\nRose's larger eyes were of a pure, deep hazel. Her hair, as thick and\r\ncurly as Lily's, was far more glossy and flossy, and of the yellowest,\r\nbrightest gold-color. Her nose--a most perfect little nose--was more\r\naquiline than her sister's. Her skin was of the tints of the finest\r\nrare-ripe peaches,--pure white and deepening pink; and all around her\r\nmouth were dimples lying in wait for her to laugh.\r\n\r\nAs they met Miss Dudley, with the many-colored Virginia creepers behind\r\nthem and the flowers behind her, a better _tableau vivant_ of \"first\r\nyouth\" and _first age_ could scarcely have been put together than they\r\nmade. It made me wish that I had been more than a painter of\r\n_specimens_. The elder lady presented me to the younger ones; and they\r\ngreeted me with that pretty courtesy that always charms us twofold when\r\nwe meet with it in children, because we scarcely expect it of them.\r\nRose's radiant little countenance, especially, seemed to say, \"I have\r\nheard of you before, and wished to know you\"; and that is one of the\r\nmost winning expressions that a new countenance can wear. Then they put\r\ntheir arms round \"dear Aunt Lizzy,\" coaxed her for peaches, and obtained\r\nthe remainder of our basketful without much difficulty; and then I had\r\nto depart, but not quite without solace, for Rose ran after me to say,\r\n\"Aunt Lizzy hopes, if you are not otherwise engaged, to see you again\r\nMonday morning at nine; and she sends you this book that she forgot to\r\ngive you. It made her think of you, she says, when she was reading it.\"\r\n\r\nIt was Greenwood's \"Sermons of Consolation\"; and, written in her hand on\r\nthe fly-leaf, I found my name.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] The old philosophy held, that \"Nature abhors a vacuum\"; but modern\r\nobservation shows that the natural Yankee abhors the air.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE SWORD OF BOLIVAR.\r\n\r\n\r\n    With the steadfast stars above us,\r\n      And the molten stars below,\r\n    We sailed through the Southern midnight,\r\n      By the coast of Mexico.\r\n\r\n    Alone, on the desolate, dark-ringed,\r\n      Rolling and flashing sea,\r\n    A grim old Venezuelan\r\n      Kept the deck with me,\r\n    And talked to me of his country,\r\n      And the long Spanish war,\r\n    And told how a young Republic\r\n      Forged the sword of Bolivar.\r\n\r\n    Of no base mundane metal\r\n      Was the wondrous weapon made,\r\n    And in no earth-born fire\r\n      Was fashioned the sacred blade.\r\n\r\n    But that it might shine the symbol\r\n      Of law and light in the land,\r\n    Dropped down as a star from heaven,\r\n      To flame in a hero's hand.\r\n\r\n    And be to the world a portent\r\n      Of eternal might and right,\r\n    They chose for the steel a splinter\r\n      From a fallen aerolite.\r\n\r\n    Then a virgin forge they builded\r\n      By the city, and kindled it\r\n    With flame from a shattered palm-tree,\r\n      Which the lightning's torch had lit,--\r\n\r\n    That no fire of earthly passion\r\n      Might taint the holy sword,\r\n    And no ancient error tarnish\r\n      The falchion of the Lord.\r\n\r\n    For Quito and New Granada\r\n      And Venezuela they pour\r\n    From three crucibles the dazzling\r\n      White meteoric ore.\r\n\r\n    In three ingots it is moulded,\r\n      And welded into one,\r\n    For an emblem of Colombia,\r\n      Bright daughter of the sun!\r\n\r\n    It is drawn on a virgin anvil,\r\n      It is heated and hammered and rolled,\r\n    It is shaped and tempered and burnished,\r\n      And set in a hilt of gold;\r\n\r\n    For thus by the fire and the hammer\r\n      Of war a nation is built,\r\n    And ever the sword of its power\r\n      Is swayed by a golden hilt.\r\n\r\n    Then with pomp and oratory\r\n      The mustachioed señores brought\r\n    To the house of the Liberator\r\n      The weapon they had wrought;\r\n    And they said, in their stately phrases,\r\n      \"O mighty in peace and war!\r\n    No mortal blade we bring you,\r\n      But a flaming meteor.\r\n\r\n    \"The sword of the Spaniard is broken,\r\n      And to you in its stead is given,\r\n    To lead and redeem a nation,\r\n      This ray of light from heaven.\"\r\n\r\n    The gaunt-faced Liberator\r\n      From their hands the symbol took,\r\n    And waved it aloft in the sunlight,\r\n      With a high, heroic look;\r\n\r\n    And he called the saints to witness:\r\n      \"May these lips turn into dust,\r\n    And this right hand fail, if ever\r\n      It prove recreant to its trust!\r\n\r\n    \"Never the sigh of a bondman\r\n      Shall cloud this gleaming steel,\r\n    But only the foe and the traitor\r\n      Its vengeful edge shall feel.\r\n\r\n    \"Never a tear of my country\r\n      Its purity shall stain,\r\n    Till into your hands, who gave it,\r\n      I render it again.\"\r\n\r\n    Now if ever a chief was chosen\r\n      To cover a cause with shame,\r\n    And if ever there breathed a caitiff,\r\n      Bolivar was his name.\r\n\r\n    From his place among the people\r\n      To the highest seat he went,\r\n    By the winding paths of party\r\n      And the stair of accident.\r\n\r\n    A restless, weak usurper,\r\n      Striving to rear a throne,\r\n    Filling his fame with counsels\r\n      And conquests not his own;--\r\n\r\n    Now seeming to put from him\r\n      The sceptre of command,\r\n    Only that he might grasp it\r\n      With yet a firmer hand;--\r\n\r\n    His country's trusted leader,\r\n      In league with his country's foes,\r\n    Stabbing the cause that nursed him,\r\n      And openly serving those;--\r\n\r\n    The chief of a great republic\r\n      Plotting rebellion still,--\r\n    An apostate faithful only\r\n      To his own ambitious will.\r\n\r\n    Drunk with a vain ambition,\r\n      In his feeble, reckless hand,\r\n    The sword of Eternal Justice\r\n      Became but a brawler's brand.\r\n\r\n    And Colombia was dissevered,\r\n      Rent by factions, till at last\r\n    Her name among the nations\r\n      Is a memory of the past.\r\n\r\n    Here the grim old Venezuelan\r\n      Puffed fiercely his red cigar\r\n    A brief moment, then in the ocean\r\n      It vanished like a star;\r\n\r\n    And he slumbered in his hammock;\r\n      And only the ceaseless rush\r\n    Of the reeling and sparkling waters\r\n      Filled the solemn midnight hush,\r\n\r\n    As I leaned by the swinging gunwale\r\n      Of the good ship, sailing slow,\r\n    With the steadfast heavens above her,\r\n      And the molten heavens below.\r\n\r\n    Then I thought with sorrow and yearning\r\n      Of my own distracted land,\r\n    And the sword let down from heaven\r\n      To flame in her ruler's hand,--\r\n\r\n    The sword of Freedom, resplendent\r\n      As a beam of the morning star,\r\n    Received, reviled, and dishonored\r\n      By another than Bolivar!\r\n\r\n    And my prayers flew home to my country:\r\n      O ye tried and fearless crew!\r\n    O ye pilots of the nation!\r\n      Now her safety is with you.\r\n\r\n    Beware the traitorous captain,\r\n      And the wreckers on the shore;\r\n    Guard well the noble vessel;\r\n      And steadily evermore,\r\n\r\n    As ye steer through the perilous midnight,\r\n      Let your faithful glances go\r\n    To the steadfast stars above her,\r\n      From their fickle gleams below.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHROUGH BROADWAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe incessant demolition of which Broadway is the scene denotes to the\r\nmost careless eye that devotion to the immediate which De Tocqueville\r\nmaintains to be a democratic characteristic. The huge piles of old\r\nbricks which block the way--with their array of placards heralding every\r\ngrade of popular amusement, from a tragedy of Shakespeare to a negro\r\nmelody, and from a menagerie to a clairvoyant exhibition, and vaunting\r\nevery kind of experimental charlatanism, from quack medicine to flash\r\nliterature--are mounds of less mystery, but more human meaning, than\r\nthose which puzzle archæologists on the Mississippi and the Ohio; for\r\nthey are the _débris_ of mansions only half a century ago the\r\naristocratic homes of families whose descendants are long since\r\nscattered, and whose social prominence and local identity are forgotten,\r\nwhile trade has obliterated every vestige of their roof-tree and\r\nassociation of their hearth-stone. Such is the constant process. As\r\nprivate residences give way to stores and offices, the upper portion of\r\nthe island is crowded with their enlarged dimensions and elaborate\r\nluxury; churches are in the same manner sacrificed, until St. Paul's and\r\nTrinity alone remain of the old sacred landmarks; and the suburban\r\nfeature--those \"fields\" where burgomasters foregathered, the militia\r\ndrilled, and Hamilton's youthful eloquence roused the people to arms--is\r\ntransferred to the other and distant end of Manhattan, and expanded into\r\na vast, variegated, and beautiful rural domain,--that \"the Park\" may\r\ncoincide in extent and attraction with the increase of the population\r\nand growth of the city's area. Thus a perpetual tide of emigration, and\r\nthe pressure of the business on the resident section,--involving change\r\nof domicile, substitution of uses, the alternate destruction and\r\nerection of buildings, each being larger and more costly in material\r\nthan its predecessor,--make the metropolis of the New World appear, to\r\nthe visitor from the Old, a shifting bivouac rather than a stable city,\r\nwhere hereditary homes are impossible, and nomadic instincts prevalent,\r\nand where local associations, such as endear or identify the streets\r\nabroad, seem as incongruous as in the Eastern desert or Western woods,\r\nwhose dwellers \"fold their tents like the Arabs, and as silently steal\r\naway.\" The absence of the law of primogeniture necessitates the breaking\r\nup of estates, and thus facilitates the methods whereby the elegant\r\nhomestead becomes, in the second or third generation, a dry-goods store,\r\na boarding or club house, a milliner's show-room or a dentist's office.\r\nHere and there some venerable gossip will rehearse the triumphs of\r\nrefined hospitality, or describe the success of a belle or the\r\nbrilliancy of a genial leader in politics or social pastime, which,\r\nyears ago, consecrated a mansion or endeared a neighborhood,--whereof\r\nnot a visible relic is now discoverable, save in a portrait or\r\nreminiscent paper conserved in the archives of the Historical Society.\r\nAnd in this speedy oblivion of domestic and social landmarks, how easily\r\nwe find a reason for the national irreverence, and the exclusive\r\ninterest in the future, which make the life of America, like the streets\r\nof her cities, a scene of transition unhallowed by memorials.\r\n\r\nYet, despite its dead horses and vehicular entanglements, its vile\r\nconcert saloons, the alternate meanness and magnificence of its\r\narchitecture, the fragile character of its theatrical structures, and\r\ntheir limited and hazardous means of exit,--despite falling walls and\r\nthe necessity of police guardianship at the crossings, the reckless\r\ndriving of butcher-boys and the dexterity of pickpockets,--despite the\r\nslippery pavement, and the chronic cry for \"relief,\"--Broadway is a\r\nspectacle and an experience worth patient study, and wonderfully\r\nprolific of life-pictures. With a fountain at one end, like a French\r\ntown, and a chime of bells at the other, like a German city, the\r\nintermediate space is as representative a rendezvous as can be found in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that strikes an experienced eye in New York's great\r\nthoroughfare is the paucity of loiterers: he sees, at a glance, that the\r\n_flâneur_ is an exotic here. There is that in the gait and look of every\r\none that shows a settled and an eager purpose,--a goal sought under\r\npressure. A counting-room, office, court, mart, or mansion is to be\r\nreached punctually, and therefore the eye and step are straightforward,\r\nintent, preoccupied. But this peculiarity is chiefly obvious early and\r\nlate in the day, when business and professional men are on their way to\r\nand from the place of their daily vocations. Later, and especially about\r\ntwo hours after noon, it is the dress and number of the other sex that\r\nwin attention; and to one fresh from London, the street attire of\r\n_ladies_--or those who aspire, with more or less justice, to that\r\ntitle--is a startling incongruity; for the showy colors and fine\r\ntextures reserved across the sea for the opera, the _salon_, and the\r\nfashionable drive, are here displayed on shopping expeditions, for which\r\nan English lady dresses in neutral tints and substantial\r\nfabrics,--avoiding rather than courting observation. The vulgar\r\nimpression derived in Broadway from an opposite habit is vastly\r\nincreased by modern fashions; for the apology for a bonnet that leaves\r\nbrow, cheek, and head fully exposed,--the rustle and dimensions of\r\ncrinoline,--the heavy masses of unctuous false hair attached to the back\r\nof the head, deforming its shape and often giving a coarse monstrosity\r\nto its naturally graceful poise and proportions,--the inappropriate\r\ndisplay of jewelry and the long silk trains of the expensive robes\r\ntrailing on the dirty walk, and continually caught beneath the feet of\r\ncareless pedestrians,--all unite to render the exhibition repulsive to\r\ntaste, good sense, and that chivalric sympathy inspired by the sight of\r\nfemale beauty and grace, so often co-existent with these anomalies.\r\nBroadway has often been compared to a kaleidoscope,--an appellation\r\nsuggested by the variety of shifting tints, from those of female dress\r\nto those of innumerable commodities, from dazzling effects of sunshine\r\nto the radiance of equipage, vivid paint, gilded signs, and dazzling\r\nwares. And blent with this pervading language of colors are the local\r\nassociations which the articles of merchandise hint. Consider how\r\nextensive is their scope,--Persian carpets, Lyons silks, Genoa velvets,\r\nribbons from Coventry and laces from Brussels, the furs of the\r\nNorthwest, glass of Bohemia, ware of China, nuts from Brazil, silver of\r\nNevada mines, Sicily lemons, Turkey figs, metallic coffins and fresh\r\nviolets, Arabian dates, French chocolate, pine-apples from the West\r\nIndies, venison from the Adirondacs, brilliant chemicals, gilded frames,\r\nManchester cloth, Sheffield cutlery, Irish linens, ruddy fruit, salmon\r\nfrom the Thousand Isles, sables from Russia, watches from Geneva,\r\ncarvings from Switzerland, caricatures and India-rubber garments,\r\nsaccharine temples, books in tinted covers, toys, wines, perfumes,\r\ndrugs, dainties, art, luxury, science, all lavishing their products to\r\nallure the throng,--phenomena common, indeed, to all streets devoted to\r\ntrade, but here uniquely combined with a fashionable promenade, and\r\naffording the still-life of a variegated moving panorama. It is\r\ncharacteristic, also, that the only palatial buildings along the crowded\r\navenue are stores and hotels. Architecture thus glorifies the gregarious\r\nextravagance of the people. The effect of the whole is indefinitely\r\nprolonged, to an imaginative mind, by the vistas at the lower extremity,\r\nwhich reveal the river, and, at sunset, the dark tracery of the shipping\r\nagainst the far and flushed horizon; while, if one lifts his eye to the\r\ntelegraph wire, or lowers it to some excavation which betrays the\r\nCroton pipes, a sublime consciousness is awakened of the relation of\r\nthis swift and populous eddy of life's great ocean to its distant rural\r\nstreams, and the ebb and flow of humanity's eternal tide. Consider, too,\r\nthe representative economics and delectations around, available to\r\ntaste, necessity, and cash,--how wonderful their contrast! Not long\r\nsince, an Egyptian museum, with relics dating from the Pharaohs, was\r\naccessible to the Broadway philosopher, and a Turkish khan to the\r\nsybarite; one has but to mount a staircase, and find himself in the\r\npresence of authentic effigies of all the prominent men of the nation,\r\nsun-painted for the million. This pharmacist will exorcise his\r\npain-demon; that electrician place him _en rapport_ with kindred\r\nhundreds of miles away, or fortify his jaded nerves. Down this street he\r\nmay enjoy a Russian or Turkish bath; down that, a water-cure. Here, with\r\nskill undreamed of by civilized antiquity, fine gold can be made to\r\nreplace the decayed segment of a tooth; there, he has but to stretch out\r\nhis foot, and a chiropodist removes the throbbing bunion, or a boy\r\nkneels to polish his boots. A hackman is at hand to drive him to the\r\nPark, a telescope to show him the stars; he has but to pause at a corner\r\nand buy a journal which will place him _au courant_ with the events of\r\nthe world, or listen to an organ-grinder, and think himself at the\r\nopera. This temple is free for him to enter and \"muse till the fire\r\nburns\"; on yonder bookseller's counter is an epitome of the wisdom of\r\nages; there he may buy a nosegay to propitiate his lady-love, or a\r\nsewing-machine to beguile his womankind, and here a crimson balloon or\r\nspring rocking-horse, to delight his little boy, and rare gems or a\r\nsilver service for a bridal gift. This English tailor will provide him\r\nwith a \"capital fit,\" that German tobacconist with a creamy meerschaum.\r\nAt the artificial Spa he may recuperate with Vichy or Kissingen, and at\r\nthe phrenologist's have his mental and moral aptitudes defined; now a\r\n\"medium\" invites him to a spiritual _séance_, and now an antiquarian to\r\na \"curiosity shop.\" In one saloon is _lager_ such as he drank in\r\nBavaria, and in another, the best bivalves in the world. Here is a fine\r\nbilliard-table, there a gymnasium;--food for mind and body,\r\ngratification to taste;--all the external resources of civilization are\r\nat hand,--not always with the substantial superiority of those of London\r\nor the elegant variety of Paris, but with enough of both to make them\r\navailable to the eclectic cosmopolite.\r\n\r\nThe historical epochs of New York are adequately traceable by the\r\nsuccessive pictures of her main thoroughfare,--beginning with the Indian\r\nvillage and the primeval forest which Henry Hudson found on the island\r\nof Manhattan in 1609, and advancing to the stockade fort of New\r\nAmsterdam, built where the Battery now is, by Wouter Van Twiller, the\r\nsecond Dutch governor, and thence to the era when the fur trade,\r\ntobacco-growing, and slavery were enriching the India Company, when the\r\nWall was built on the site of the so-called financial rendezvous, to\r\nprotect the settlement from savage invasion, and a deep valley marked\r\nthe present junction of Canal Street and Broadway. The advent of a new\r\nclass of artisans signalizes the arrival of Huguenot emigrants; the\r\nrebellion of Leisler marks the encroachment of new political agencies,\r\nand the substitution of Pitt's statue for that of George III. on the\r\nBowling Green in 1770, the dawn of Independence, so sturdily ushered in\r\nand cherished by the Liberty Boys, and culminating in the evacuation of\r\nthe British in 1783, the entrance of Washington with the American army,\r\nand, two years after, in the meeting of the first Congress. These\r\nvicissitudes left their impress on the street. Every church but the\r\nEpiscopal was turned by the English into a riding-school, prison, or\r\nstable; each successive charter was more liberal in its municipal\r\nprivileges. The Boston stage long went from the Fort to the Park, and so\r\non by the old post-road, and was fourteen days _en route_; pestilence,\r\nimported from the West India islands, depopulated the adjacent houses;\r\nwater was sold from carts; and dimly lighted was the pedestrian on his\r\nmidnight way, while old-fashioned watchmen cried the hour; and when, in\r\n1807, Robert Fulton initiated steam navigation, the vast system of\r\nferriage was established which inundated the main avenue of the city\r\nwith a perpetual tributary stream of floating population from all the\r\noutlying shores of the Hudson and East Rivers, Staten and Long Islands,\r\nand the villages above Manhattan. A lady who lived in New York forty\r\nyears ago, and returned this season, expressed her surprise that the\r\nmatutinal procession of rustics she used to watch from the window of her\r\nfashionable domicile in the lower part of Broadway had ceased, so\r\ncompletely had suburban citizens usurped the farmers' old homes. The\r\nbeautiful pigeons that used to coo and cluster on the cobble stones had\r\nno resting-place for their coral feet on the Russ pavement, so thickly\r\nmoved the drays, and so unremitted was the rush of man and beast. In\r\nfact, the one conservative feature eloquent of the past is the\r\nchurchyard,--the old, moss-grown, sloping gravestones,--landmarks of\r\nfinished life-journeys, mutely invoking the hurrying crowd through the\r\ntall iron railings of Trinity and St. Paul's. It is a striking evidence\r\nof a \"new country,\" that a youth from the Far West, on arriving in New\r\nYork by sea, was so attracted by these ancient cemeteries that he\r\nlingered amid them all day,--saying it was the first time he had ever\r\nseen a human memorial more than twenty years old, except a tree! And\r\nmemorable was the ceremony whereby, a few years since, the Historical\r\nSociety celebrated the bicentennial birthday of Bradford, the old\r\ncolonial printer, by renewing his headstone. At noonday, when the\r\nlife-tide was at flood, in lovely May weather, a barrier was stretched\r\nacross Broadway; and there, at the head of eager gold-worshipping Wall\r\nStreet, in the heart of the bustling, trafficking crowd, a vacant place\r\nwas secured in front of the grand and holy temple of Trinity. The\r\npensive chant arose; a white band of choristers and priests came forth;\r\nand eminent citizens gathered around to reconsecrate the tablet over the\r\ndust of one who, two hundred years ago, had practised a civilizing art\r\nin this fresh land, and disseminated messages of religion and wisdom. It\r\nwas a singular picture, beautiful to the eye, solemn to the feelings,\r\nand a rare tribute to the past, where the present sways with such\r\nabsolute rule. Few Broadway tableaux are so worthy of artistic\r\npreservation. Before, the vista of a money-changers' mart; above and\r\nbelow, a long, crowded avenue of metropolitan life; behind, the lofty\r\nspire, gothic windows, and archways of the church, and the central group\r\nas picturesquely and piously suggestive as a mediæval rite.\r\n\r\nVainly would the most self-possessed reminiscent breast the living tide\r\nof the surging thoroughfare, on a weekday, to realize in his mind's eye\r\nits ancient aspect; but if it chance to him to land at the Battery on a\r\nclear and still Sabbath morning, and before the bells summon forth the\r\nworshippers, and to walk thence to Union Square in company with an\r\noctogenarian Knickerbocker of good memory, local pride, and fluent\r\nspeech, he will obtain a mental photograph of the past that transmutes\r\nthe familiar scene by a quaint and vivid aerial perspective. Then the\r\n\"Middle Road\" of the beginning of this century will reappear,--the\r\ntraces of a wheat-field on the site of St. Paul's, still a fresh\r\ntradition; Oswego Market, opposite Liberty Street, is alive with early\r\ncustomers; the reminiscent beholds the apparition of Rutgers's orchard,\r\nwhose remaining noble elms yet shade the green vista of the City\r\nHospital, and which was a place for rifling bird's-nests in the boyhood\r\nof his pensive companion, whose father played at skittles on the Bowling\r\nGreen, hard by the Governor's house, while the Dutch householders sat\r\nsmoking long pipes in their broad porticos, cosily discussing the last\r\nnews from Antwerp or Delft, their stout rosy daughters meanwhile taking\r\na twilight ramble, with their stalwart beaux, to the utmost suburban\r\nlimit of Manhattan, where Canal Street now intersects Broadway,--then an\r\nunpaved lane with scattered domiciles, only grouped into civic\r\ncontiguity around the Battery, and with many gardens enhancing its rural\r\naspect. Somewhat later, and Munn's Land Office, at the corner of what is\r\nnow Grand Street, was suggestive of a growing settlement and the era of\r\nspeculation; an isolated coach-factory marked the site of the St.\r\nNicholas Hotel; people flocked along, in domestic instalments, to\r\nVauxhall, where now stands the Astor Library, to drink mead and see the\r\nFlying Horses; and capitalists invested in \"lots\" on Bayard's Farm,\r\nwhere Niblo's and the Metropolitan now flourish; the one-story building\r\nat the present angle of Prince Street was occupied by Grant Thorburn's\r\nfather; beyond lay the old road leading to Governor Stuyvesant's\r\nBowerie, with Sandy Hill at the upper end. In 1664, Heere Stras was\r\nchanged to Broadway. At the King's Arms and Burr's Coffee-House, near\r\nthe Battery, the traitor Arnold was wont to lounge, and in the\r\nneighborhood dwelt the Earl of Stirling's mother. At the corner of\r\nRector Street was the old Lutheran church frequented by the Palatine\r\nrefugees. Beyond or within the Park stood the old Brewery, Pottery,\r\nBridewell, and Poor-house; relics of an Indian village were often found;\r\nthe Drover's Inn, cattle-walk, and pastures marked the straggling\r\nprecincts of the town; and on the commons oxen were roasted whole on\r\nholidays, and obnoxious officials hung in effigy. Anon rose the brick\r\nmansions of the Rapelyes, Rhinelanders, Kingslands, Cuttings, Jays,\r\nBogarts, Depeysters, Duers, Livingstons, Verplancks, Van Rensselaers, De\r\nLanceys, Van Cortlands, etc.; at first along the \"Middle Road,\" and then\r\nin bystreets from the main thoroughfare down to the rivers; and so,\r\ngradually, the trees and shrubs that made a _rus in urbe_ of the embryo\r\ncity, and the gables and tiles, porches and pipes, that marked the\r\ndynasty chronicled by old Diedrich, gave way to palatial warehouses,\r\nmagnificent taverns, and brown stone fronts.\r\n\r\nThe notes of old travellers best revive the scene ere it was lost in\r\nmodern improvements. Mrs. Knight, who visited New York in 1704, having\r\nperformed the journey from Boston all the way on horseback, enjoyed the\r\n\"vendues\" at Manhattan, where \"they gave drinks\"; was surprised to see\r\n\"fireplaces that had no jambs\" and \"bricks of divers colors and laid in\r\ncheckers, being glazed and looking very agreeable.\" The diversion in\r\nvogue was \"riding in sleighs about four miles out of town, where they\r\nhave a house of entertainment at a place called the Bowery.\" In 1769 Dr.\r\nBurnaby recognized but two churches, Trinity and St. George, and \"went\r\nin an Italian chaise to a turtle feast on the East River.\" In 1788,\r\nBrissot found that the session of Congress there gave great _éclat_ to\r\nNew York, but, with republican indignation, he laments the ravages of\r\nluxury and the English fashions visible in Broadway,--\"silks, gauzes,\r\nhats, and borrowed hair;... equipages rare, but elegant.\" \"The men,\" he\r\nadds, \"have more simplicity of dress; they disdain gewgaws; but they\r\ntake their revenge in the luxury of the table\";--\"and luxury,\" he\r\nobserves, \"forms a class dangerous to society,--I mean bachelors,--the\r\nexpense of women causing matrimony to be dreaded by men.\" It is curious\r\nto find the French radical of eighty years ago drawing from the life of\r\nBroadway inferences similar to those of the even more emphatic\r\neconomical moralist of to-day. In 1794, Wansey, a commercial traveller,\r\nfound the \"Tontine near the Battery\" the most eligible hotel, and met\r\nthere Dr. Priestley, breakfasted with Gates, and had a call from\r\nLivingston; saw \"some good paintings by Trumbull, at the Federal Hall,\"\r\nand Hodgkinson, at the theatre, in \"A Bold Stroke for a Husband\"; dined\r\nwith Comfort Sands; and Mr. Jay, \"brother to the Ambassador,\" took him\r\nto tea at the \"Indian Queen\";--items of information that mark the social\r\nand political transition since the days of Dutch rule, though the\r\nBattery still remained the court end and nucleus of Manhattan.\r\n\r\nBut it is not local memory alone that the solitude of Broadway awakens\r\nin our aged guide; the vacant walk is peopled, to his fancy, with\r\nthe celebrities of the past whom he has there gazed at or\r\ngreeted,--Franklin, Jay, Tom Paine, Schuyler, Cobbett, Freneau, and\r\nColonel Trumbull, with their Revolutionary prestige; Volney and Genet,\r\nwith the memory of French radicalism; Da Ponte and the old Italian\r\nopera; Colles and Clinton and the Erie Canal days; Red Jacket and the\r\naborigines; Dunlap and Dennie, the literary pioneers; Cooke, Kemble,\r\nKean, Matthews, and Macready, followed so eagerly by urchin eyes,--the\r\nimmortal heroes of the stage; Hamilton, Clinton, Morris, Burr, Gallatin,\r\nand a score of political and civic luminaries whose names have passed\r\ninto history; Decatur, Hull, Perry, and the brilliant throng of\r\nvictorious naval officers grouped near the old City Hotel; Moreau, Louis\r\nPhilippe, Talleyrand, Louis Napoleon, Maroncelli, Foresti, Kossuth,\r\nGaribaldi, and many other illustrious European exiles; Jeffrey, Moore,\r\nDickens, Thackeray, Trollope, and the long line of literary lions, from\r\nBasil Hall to Tupper; Chancellor Kent, Audubon, Fulton, Lafayette,\r\nRandolph, the Prince of Wales, and the Queen of the Sandwich Islands,\r\nTurkish admirals, Japanese officials, artists, statesmen, actors,\r\nsoldiers, authors, foreign _savans_, and domestic eccentricities, who\r\nhave perambulated this central avenue of a cosmopolitan American city.\r\nCould they have all been photographed, what a reflex of modern society\r\nwould such a picture-gallery afford!\r\n\r\nThe old Dutch traders, with the instinct of their Holland habitudes,\r\nclung to the water-side, and therefore their domiciles long extended at\r\nangles with what subsequently became the principal avenue of the\r\nsettlement; and until 1642 Pearl Street was the fashionable quarter.\r\nMeantime, where now thousands of emigrants daily disembark, and the\r\noffices of ocean steamships indicate the facility and frequency of\r\nTransatlantic travel, the Indian chiefs smoked the pipe of peace with\r\nthe victorious colonists under the shadow of Fort Amsterdam, and the\r\nlatter held fairs there, or gathered, for defence and pastime, round the\r\nlittle oasis of the metropolitan desert where carmen now read \"The Sun.\"\r\nNo. 1 was the Kennedy House, subsequently the tavern of Mrs.\r\nKoch,--whose Dutch husband was an officer in the Indian wars,--and was\r\nsuccessively the head-quarters of Clinton, Cornwallis, and Washington,\r\nand at last the Prime Mansion; and farther up was Mrs. Ryckman's\r\nboarding-house,--genial sojourn of Irving, and the scene of his early\r\npen-craft and youthful companionships, when \"New York was more handy,\r\nand everybody knew everybody, and there was more good-fellowship and\r\nease of manners.\" Those were the days of ropewalks and \"selectmen,\" of\r\nstage-coaches and oil-lamps. The Yankee invasion had scarcely superseded\r\nthe Knickerbocker element. The Free Academy was undreamed of; and the\r\nCity Hotel assemblies were the embryo Fifth Avenue balls. An old\r\nDirectory or a volume of Valentine's Manual, compared with the latest\r\nMetropolitan Guide-Book and Trow's last issue, will best illustrate the\r\ndifference between Broadway then and now.\r\n\r\nBut it is not so much the more substantial memorials as the \"dissolving\r\nviews\" that give its peculiar character to the street. Entered at the\r\nlower extremity by the newly-arrived European, on a rainy morning, the\r\nfirst impression is the reverse of grand or winsome. The squalor of the\r\ndocks and the want of altitude in the buildings, combined with the\r\nbustle and hubbub, strike the eye as repulsive; but as the scene grows\r\nfamiliar and is watched under the various aspects produced by different\r\nseasons, weather, and hours of the day, it becomes more and more\r\nsignificant and attractive. Indeed, there is probably no street in the\r\nworld subject to such violent contrasts. It is one thing on a brilliant\r\nand cool October day and another in July. White cravats and black coats\r\nmark \"Anniversary week\"; broad brims and drab, the \"Yearly Meeting\" of\r\nthe Friends; the \"moving day\" of the householders, the \"opening day\" of\r\nthe milliners, Christmas and New Year's, sleighing-time and spring,\r\nearly morning and midnight, the Sabbath and week-days, a cold spell and\r\nthe \"heated term,\"--every hour, season, holiday, panic, pastime, and\r\nparade brings into view new figures and phases,--diverse phenomena of\r\ncrowd and character,--like the shifting segments of a panorama. The news\r\nof victories during the war for the Union could be read there in\r\npeople's eyes and heard in their greetings. Sorrowful tidings seemed to\r\nmagnetize with sadness the long procession. Something in the air\r\nforetold the stranger how beat the public pulse. The undercurrent of the\r\nprevalent emotion seems to vibrate, with electric sympathy, along the\r\nhuman tide.\r\n\r\nA walk in Broadway is a most available remedy for \"domestic\" vexation\r\nand provincial egotism. \"Every individual spirit,\" says Schiller, \"waxes\r\nin the great stream of multitudes.\" Stand awhile calmly by the rushing\r\nstream, and note its representative significance, or stroll slowly\r\nalong, with observant eye, to mark the commodities and nationalities by\r\nthe way. The scene is an epitome of the world. Here crouches a Chinese\r\nmendicant, there glides an Italian image-vender; a Swedish sailor is\r\nhard pressed by a smoking Cuban, and a Hungarian officer is flanked by a\r\nFrench loiterer; here leers a wanton, there moans a waif; now passes an\r\nIrish funeral procession, and again long files of Teutonic \"Turners\";\r\nthe wistful eyes of a beggar stare at the piles of gold in the\r\nmoney-changer's show-window; a sister of charity walks beside a Jewish\r\nRabbi; then comes a brawny negro, then a bare-legged Highlander; figures\r\nsuch as are met in the Levant; school-boys with their books and\r\nlunch-boxes, Cockneys fresh from Piccadilly, a student who reminds us of\r\nBerlin, an American Indian, in pantaloons; a gaunt Western, a keen\r\nYankee, and a broad Dutch physiognomy alternate; flower-venders,\r\ndog-pedlers, diplomates, soldiers, dandies, and vagabonds, pass and\r\ndisappear; a firemen's procession, fallen horse, dead-lock of vehicles,\r\nmilitary halt, or menagerie caravan, checks momently the advancing\r\nthrong; and some beautiful face or elegant costume looms out of the\r\nconfused picture like an exquisite vision; great cubes of lake crystal\r\nglisten in the ice-carts hard by blocks of ebon coal from the forests of\r\nthe primeval world; there a letter-carrier threads his way, and here a\r\nnewsboy shouts his extra; a milk-cart rattles by, and a walking\r\nadvertisement stalks on; here is a fashionable doctor's gig, there a\r\nmammoth express-wagon; a sullen Southerner contrasts with a grinning\r\nGaul, a darkly-vested bishop with a gayly-attired child, a\r\ndaintily-gloved belle with a mud-soiled drunkard; a little shoe-black\r\nand a blind fiddler ply their trades in the shadow of Emmet's obelisk,\r\nand a toy-merchant has Montgomery's mural tablet for a background; on\r\nthe fence is a string of favorite ballads and popular songs; a mock\r\nauctioneer shouts from one door, and a silent wax effigy gazes from\r\nanother. Pisani, who accompanied Prince Napoleon in his yacht-voyage to\r\nAmerica, calls Broadway a bazaar made up of savagery and civilization, a\r\nmile and a half long; and M. Fisch, a French _pasteur_, was surprised at\r\nthe sight of palaces six or seven stories high devoted to commerce and\r\n_les figures fines et gracieuses, la démarche légère et libre des\r\nfemmes, les allures vives de toute la population_. The shopkeepers are\r\nurbanely courteous, says one traveller. \"Horses and harness are fine,\r\nbut equipages inferior,\" observes another; while a third remarks, after\r\nwitnessing the escapade of vehicles in Broadway: \"American coachmen are\r\nthe most adroit in the world.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been said that a Paris _gamin_ would laugh at our _fêtes_; and\r\nyet, if such a loyal custodian as one of the old sacristans we meet\r\nabroad, who has kept a life-vigil in a famous cathedral, or such a\r\nvigilant chronicler as was Dr. Gemmelaro, who for years noted in a diary\r\nthe visitors to Ætna, and all the phenomena of the volcano,--_if_ such a\r\nfond sentinel were to have watched, even for less than a century, and\r\nrecorded the civic, military, and industrial processions of Broadway,\r\nwhat a panoramic view we should have of the fortunes, development, and\r\ntransitions of New York! The last of the cocked-hats would appear with\r\nthe final relics of Dutch and Quaker costume; the celebration of the\r\nopening of the Erie Canal would seem consummated by the festivals that\r\nsignalized the introduction of Croton, and the success of the Atlantic\r\nTelegraph; the funeral _cortége_ of Washington would precede that of\r\nscores of patriots and heroes, from Hamilton and Lawrence to John Quincy\r\nAdams and General Wadsworth; Scott would reappear victorious from\r\nMexico, Kossuth's plumed hat wave again to the crowd, grim Jackson's\r\nwhite head loom once more to the eager multitude, and Lafayette's\r\ncourteous greetings win their cheers; St. Patrick's interminable line of\r\nfollowers would contrast with the robes and tails of the Japanese,--the\r\nlanterns of a political battalion, with the badges of a masonic\r\nfraternity,--the obsolete uniform of the \"Old Continentals,\" with the\r\nred shirts of the firemen and the miniature banners of a Sunday-school\r\nphalanx,--the gay citizen soldiers who turned out to honor Independence\r\nor Evacuation Day, with the bronzed and maimed veterans bringing home\r\ntheir bullet-torn flags from the bloody field of a triumphant patriotic\r\nwar,--the first negro regiment raised therefor cheerily escorted by the\r\nUnion League Club, with the sublime funeral train of the martyred\r\nPresident. Including party demonstrations, popular ovations, memorable\r\nreceptions and obsequies,--Broadway processions, historically speaking,\r\nuniquely illustrate the civic growth, the political freedom, the\r\ncosmopolitan sympathies, and the social prosperity of New York.\r\n\r\nThe mutations and ameliorations of Broadway are singularly rapid. It is\r\nbut a few years since the eye of the passenger therein often caught\r\nsight of pleasant domestic nooks,--bulbs in bloom, a canary, gold-fish,\r\nor a graceful head bent over a book or crochet-work, at the cheerful\r\nwindow,--where now iron fronts and plate-glass of enormous size proclaim\r\nthe prosperous warehouse. One of those sudden and sweeping\r\nconflagrations, which so frequently make a breach in the long line of\r\nedifices, destroyed within a few months the tall white walls of the\r\nAmerican Museum, with its flaring effigies of giants, dwarfs, and\r\nmonsters, and its band of musicians in the balcony, so alluring to the\r\nrustic visitor. The picturesque church of St. Thomas and the heavy\r\ngranite façade of the Stuyvesant Institute, the \"Tabernacle,\" the\r\nArt-Academy, and the Society Library buildings have given way to palaces\r\nof trade, and been transferred to the indefinitely extensive region of\r\n\"up town.\" Stewart's lofty marble stores redeemed the character of the\r\neast side, long neglected in favor of the more crowded and showy\r\nopposite walk; and his example has been followed by so many other\r\nenterprising capitalists, that the original difference, both of aspect\r\nand prestige, has all but vanished.\r\n\r\nAmong the most noticeable of the later features are the prevalence of\r\nflower-venders, and the increase of beggars; as well as the luxurious\r\nattractiveness of the leading confectioners' establishments, which, in\r\ntrue American eclectic style, combine the Parisian café with the London\r\npastry-cooks and the Continental restaurant,--delectable rendezvous of\r\nwomen who lunch extravagantly. Another and more refined feature is the\r\nincrease of elegant Art stores, where Gerome's latest miracle of\r\nOriental delineation, a fresh landscape of Auchenbach, or a naive gem by\r\nFrere, is freely exposed to the public eye, beside new and elaborate\r\nengravings, and graphic war-groups of Rogers, or the latest crayon of\r\nDarley, sunset of Church, or rock-study by Haseltine. These free\r\nglimpses of modern Art are indicative of the growing taste for and\r\ninterest therein among us. Pictures were never such profitable and\r\nprecious merchandise here, and the fortunes of artists are different\r\nfrom what they were in the days when Cole used to bring his new\r\nlandscape to town, deposit it in the house of a friend, and personally\r\ncall the attention thereto of the few who cared for such things, and\r\nwhen the fashionable portrait-painter was the exclusive representative\r\nof the guild in Gotham.\r\n\r\nThe Astor House was the first of the large hotels on Broadway; and its\r\nerection marks a new era in that favorite kind of enterprise and\r\nentertainment of which Bunker's Mansion House was so long the\r\ncomfortable, respectable, and home-like ideal. Yet it is noteworthy that\r\ninns rarely have or keep a representative character with us, but blend\r\npopularity with fashion, as nowhere else. One may be associated with\r\nRebeldom, another with trade; this be frequented by Eastern, and that by\r\nWestern travellers; and nationalities may be identified with certain\r\nresorts. But the tendency is towards the eclectic and homogeneous;\r\nindividuality not less than domesticity is trenched upon and fused in\r\nthese extravagant caravanseries; and there is no fact more\r\ncharacteristic of the material luxury and gregarious standard of New\r\nYork life, than that the only temple erected to her patron saint is a\r\nmarble tavern!\r\n\r\nBroadway has always had its eccentric or notable _habitués_. The Muse of\r\nHalleck, in her palmy days, immortalized not a few; and many persons\r\nstill recall the \"crazy poet Clarke,\" the \"Lime-Kiln man,\" the courteous\r\nand venerable Toussaint,--New York's best \"image of God carved in\r\nebony,\"--tall \"gentleman George\" Barrett, and a host of \"familiar faces\"\r\nassociated with local fame or social traits. The representative clergy,\r\nphysicians, lawyers, merchants, editors, politicians, bards, and\r\nbeauties, \"men about town,\" and actors, were there identified, saluted,\r\nand observed; and of all these, few seemed so appropriately there as the\r\nlast; for often there was and is a melodramatic aspect and association\r\nin the scene, and Burton, Placide, or the elder Wallack walked there\r\nwith a kind of professional self-complacency. Thackeray, who had a quick\r\nand trained eye for the characteristic in cities, delighted in Broadway,\r\nfor its cheerful variety, its perpetual \"comedy of life\"; the\r\nsignificance whereof is only more apparent to the sympathetic observer,\r\nbecause now and then through the eager throng glides the funeral car to\r\nthe sound of muffled drums, the \"Black Maria\" with its convict load, or\r\nthe curtained hospital litter with its dumb and maimed burden. And then,\r\nto the practised frequenter, how, one by one, endeared figures and faces\r\ndisappear from that diurnal stage! It seems but yesterday since we met\r\nthere Dr. Francis's cheering salutation, or listened to Dr. Bethune's\r\nand Fenno Hoffman's genial and John Stephens's truthful talk,--watched\r\nGeneral Scott's stalwart form, Dr. Kane's lithe frame, Cooper's\r\nself-reliant step, Peter Parley's juvenile cheerfulness,--and grasped\r\nHenry Inman's cordial hand, or listened to Irving's humorous\r\nreminiscence, and met the benign smile of dear old Clement Moore. As to\r\nfairer faces and more delicate shapes,--to encounter which was the\r\ncrowning joy of our promenade,--and \"cheeks grown holy with the lapse of\r\nyears,\" memory holds them too sacred for comment. \"Passing away\" is the\r\nperpetual refrain in the chorus of humanity in this bustling\r\nthoroughfare, to the sober eye of maturity. The never-ending procession,\r\nto the sensitive and the observant, has also infinite degrees of\r\nlanguage. Some faces seem to welcome, others to defy, some to lower, and\r\nsome to brighten, many to ignore, a few to challenge or charm,--as we\r\npass. And what lessons of fortune and of character are written\r\nthereon,--the blush of innocence and the hardihood of recklessness, the\r\ncandid grace of honor and the mean deprecatory glance of knavery,\r\nintelligence and stupidity, soulfulness and vanity, the glad smile of\r\nfriendship, the shrinking eye of fallen fortune, the dubious recognition\r\nof disgrace, the effrontery of the adventurer, and the calm, pleasant\r\nbearing of rectitude,--all that is beautiful and base in humanity,\r\ngleams, glances, and disappears as the crowd pass on.\r\n\r\nRichard Cobden, when in New York, was caught and long detained in a mesh\r\nof drays and carriages in Broadway, and he remarked that the absence of\r\npassionate profanity among the carmen and drivers, and the good-natured\r\npatience they manifested, were in striking contrast with the blasphemous\r\nviolence exhibited in London under like circumstances; and he attributed\r\nit to the greater self-respect bred in this class of men here by the\r\nprospect and purpose of a higher vocation. It is curious to observe how\r\nprofessional are the impressions and observations of Broadway\r\npedestrians. Walk there with a portrait-painter, and he will infer\r\ncharacter or discover subjects of art in every salient physiognomy. The\r\ndisparities of fortune and the signs of depravity will impress the\r\nmoralist. The pictorial effects, the adventurous possibilities, the\r\nenterprise, care, or pastime of the scene, elicit comments in accordance\r\nwith the idiosyncrasies or aptitudes of the observer. What gradations of\r\ngreeting, from the curt recognition to the hilarious salute! What\r\nvariety of attraction and repulsion, according as your acquaintance is a\r\nbore or a beauty, a benefactor or a bankrupt! The natural language of\r\n\"affairs,\" however, is the predominant expression. From the days of Rip\r\nVan Dam to those of John Pintard, it is as a commercial city that New\r\nYork has drawn both her rural and foreign population. And her chief\r\nthoroughfare retains the distinctive aspect thereof, as the extension of\r\nthe city has eliminated therefrom all other social elements,--fashion\r\nbeing transferred to the Fifth Avenue, indigence to the Five Points, and\r\nequipages to the Central Park. Police reports abound with the ruses and\r\nroughnesses of metropolitan life, as developed in the most frequented\r\nstreets, where rogues seek safety in crowds. A rheumatic friend of ours\r\ndropped a guinea in the Strand, and, being unable to stoop, placed his\r\nfoot upon the coin, and waited and watched for the right man to ask to\r\npick it up for him. He was astonished at the difficulty of the choice.\r\nOne passer was too elegant, another too abstracted, one looked\r\ndishonest, and another haughty. At last he saw approaching a serious,\r\nkindly-looking, middle-aged loiterer, with a rusty black suit and white\r\ncravat,--apparently a poor curate taking his \"constitutional.\" Our\r\nfriend explained his dilemma, and was assured, in the most courteous\r\nterms, that the stranger would accommodate him with pleasure. Very\r\ndeliberately the latter picked up the guinea, wiped it carefully on his\r\ncoat-sleeve, and transferred it to his vest-pocket,--walking off with a\r\ncheerful nod. Indignant at the trick, the invalid called out \"Stop,\r\nthief!\" The rascal was chased and caught, and, when taken to the police\r\noffice, proved to be Bristol Bill,--one of the most notorious and\r\nevasive burglars in London. Many like instances of false pretences are\r\ntraditional in Broadway,--where there are sometimes visible scenic\r\npersonages, like a quack doctor whose costume and bearing were borrowed\r\nfrom Don Pasquale, and Dr. Knickerbocker in the elegant and obselete\r\nbreeches, buckles, and cocked hat of the olden time.\r\n\r\nA peculiar hardihood and local wit are claimed for what are called the\r\nB'hoys. A cockney, in pursuit of knowledge under difficulties, was\r\nwalking up Broadway with the hospitable citizen to whose guidance he\r\nhad been specially commended by a London correspondent.\r\n\r\n\"I want,\" said the stranger, \"to see a b'hoy,--a real b'hoy.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's one,\" replied his companion, pointing to a strapping fellow, in\r\na red shirt and crush hat, waiting for a job at the corner.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, how curious!\" replied John Bull, examining this new species with\r\nhis double eye-glass,--\"very curious; I never saw a real b'hoy before. I\r\nshould like to hear him speak.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, why don't you talk to him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what to say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ask him the way to Laight Street.\"\r\n\r\nThe inquisitive traveller crossed the street, and, deferentially\r\napproaching the new genus, lisped, \"Ha--ah--how d' do, ha? I want to go\r\nto Laight Street.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why in hell don't you go?\" loudly and gruffly asks the b'hoy.\r\n\r\nCockney nervously rejoined his friend, saying,--\"Very curious, the\r\nBroadway b'hoys!\"\r\n\r\nTo realize the extent and character of the Celtic element in our\r\npopulation, walk down this thronged avenue on a holiday, when the Irish\r\ncrowd the sidewalks, waiting for a pageant; and all you have ever read\r\nor dreamed of savagery will gleam, with latent fire, from those myriads\r\nof sullen or daredevil eyes, and lurk in the wild tones of those\r\nunchastened voices, as the untidy or gaudily dressed and interminable\r\nline of expectants, flushed with alcohol, yield surlily to the backward\r\nwave of the policeman's baton. The materials of riot in the heart of the\r\nvast and populous city then strike one with terror. We see the worst\r\nelements of European life cast upon our shore, and impending, as it\r\nwere, like a huge wave, over the peacefulness and prosperity of the\r\nnation. The corruptions of New York local government are explained at a\r\nglance. The reason why even patriotic citizens shrink from the primary\r\nmeetings whence spring the practical issues of municipal rule is easily\r\nunderstood; and the absolute necessity of a reform in the legislative\r\nmachinery, whereby property and character may find adequate\r\nrepresentation, is brought home to the most careless observer of\r\nBroadway phenomena. But it is when threading the normal procession\r\ntherein that distrust wanes, in view of so much that is hopeful in\r\nenterprise and education, and auspicious in social intelligence and\r\nsympathy. It may be that on one of our bright and balmy days of early\r\nspring, or on a cool and radiant autumnal afternoon, you behold, in your\r\nwalk from Union Square to the Battery, an eminent representative of each\r\nfunction and phase of high civilization;--wealth vested in real estate\r\nin the person of an Astor, peerless nautical architecture in a Webb; the\r\nalert step and venerable head of the poet of nature, as Bryant glides\r\nby, and the still bright eye of the poet of patriotism and wit, as\r\nHalleck greets you with the zest of a rural visitor refreshed by the\r\nsight of \"old, familiar faces\"; anon comes Bancroft, a chronicler of\r\nAmerica's past, yet moving sympathetically through living history the\r\nwhile; Verplanck, the Knickerbocker Nestor, and the gentlemen of the old\r\nschool represented by Irving's old friend, the companionable and\r\ncourteous Governor Kemble; pensive, olive-cheeked, sad-eyed Hamlet, in\r\nthe person of Edwin Booth, our native histrionic genius; Vandyke-looking\r\nCharles Elliot, the portrait-painter; Paez, the exiled South American\r\ngeneral; Farragut, the naval hero; Hancock, Hooker, Barlow, or some\r\nother gallant army officer,--volunteer heroes, maimed veterans of the\r\nUnion war; merchants, whose names are synonymous with beneficence and\r\nintegrity; artists, whose landscapes have revealed the loveliness of\r\nthis hemisphere to the Old World; women who lend grace to society and\r\nfeed the poor; men of science, who alleviate, and of literature, who\r\nconsole, the sorrows of humanity; the stanch in friendship, the loyal in\r\nnational sentiment, the indomitable in duty, the exemplary in Christian\r\nfaith, the tender and true in domestic life,--the redeeming and\r\nrecuperative elements of civic society.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMY HEATHEN AT HOME.\r\n\r\n\r\nKicking my \"Dutch wife,\"[3] that comfortable Batavian device, to the\r\nfoot of the bed, and turning over with a delicious stretch just as day\r\nbegan to dawn, I opened my eyes with a drowsy sense of refreshing\r\nfavor,--a half-dream, mixed of burning and breeze,--and discovered old\r\nKarlee, my pearl of bhearers,[4] waiting in still patience on the\r\noutside of the tent-like mosquito curtain, punka in hand, and tenderly\r\nwaving a balmy blessing across the sirocco-plagued sand of my slumber.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, Karlee.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Salaam, Sahib-bhote-bhote salaam!_[5] Master catch plenty good isleep\r\nthis night, Karlee hope.\"\r\n\r\n\"So, so,--so, so. But you look happy this morning; your eyes are bright,\r\nand your kummerbund[6] jaunty, and you sport a new turban. What's the\r\ngood news, old man?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Sahib. Large joy Karlee have got,--happy _kismut_,[7]--too much\r\njolly good luck, master, please.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aha! I'm glad of it. None too jolly for my patient Karlee, I'll\r\nengage,--not a whit too happy and proud for my faithful, grateful,\r\nhumble old man. And what is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"By master's favor, one man-child have got; one fine son he come this\r\nnight, please master's graciousness.\"\r\n\r\n\"A son--your wife!--what, you, Karlee, _you_?\"\r\n\r\n\"Please master's pardon, no,--Karlee wife, no; Karlee daughter, Karlee\r\nison-in-law, one man-child have catch this night, by Sahib's merciful\r\ngoodness.\"\r\n\r\n\"So! your daughter and her husband, the young kitmudgar,[8] they that\r\nwere married last year. Good! let us exalt our horn, let us glorify\r\nourselves; for is it not written, 'By a son a man shall obtain victory\r\nover all people; by a son's son he shall enjoy immortality; and by a\r\nson's son's son he shall reach the solar abodes'? Verily it is pleasant\r\nto have a boy-butcha in the house,--the heir and lord. So we will even\r\nmake merry to-day; to-day we will take holiday. Let the buttons wait,\r\nand the beard go awry; send the barber away, and tell the tailor to come\r\nto-morrow; for one day Sahib, the master of earth, abdicates in favor of\r\n_Puttro_, the 'Deliverer from Hell,' the true king for every pious\r\nHindoo. And here are some rupees to buy him a happy horoscope with, and\r\nto pay the _gooroo_[9] for a good strong charm, warranted to avert the\r\nEvil Eye.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! Master's bountiful favor too much compassion have,--too much\r\npitiful munif--\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all right, old man. Salaam now; and good luck to the baby.\"\r\n\r\nNow here, thought I, is a chance to observe my pagan at home, under the\r\nmost favorable circumstances. Karlee will devote the occasion to the\r\ndomestic felicities; he will spread holiday fare, and there will be\r\nneighborly congratulations, and a hospitable relaxation in the family of\r\nthe orthodox heathen rigor. I will make a \"surprise party\" of myself,\r\nand on the recommendation of a string of corals for the new butcha I'll\r\ncatch him in the very dishabille of his Hindooism. And I did.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI had often heard that Karlee lived well, and that his household enjoyed\r\nsubstantial comfort in a degree notably superior to the general\r\ncircumstances of his class. With eminent intelligence and devotion he\r\nhad served for more than forty years various American gentlemen residing\r\nin Calcutta, by whom, in his neat-handedness, he was esteemed a sort of\r\nhe-Phillis; and for his housewifely dusting of books and furniture, his\r\norderly keeping of drawers and trunks, his sharp eye to punkas and\r\nmosquito-nets, and his exacting discipline of sweepers and messengers,\r\nbarbers, tailors, and washermen, he had been rewarded with generous\r\nbuksheesh over and above his stipulated, wages, which were liberal; so\r\nthat among bhearers he was distinguished for respectability, by income\r\nas well as influence, and represented the best society. Between his own\r\nsavings and those of his wife,--who, as an _ayah_, or nurse, in an\r\nEnglish family high in the Civil Service, was extravagantly prized for\r\nher fidelity, skill, and patience,--Karlee had laid up a little fortune\r\nof ten thousand rupees; but that was partly by dint of a clever\r\nspeculation now and then in curiosities and choice presents, which he\r\ndisposed of among those of his American or English patrons who happened\r\nto be homeward bound. As it is not permitted to a bhearer to engage\r\ndirectly in trade, these neat little transactions were in all cases\r\nshrewdly managed by a friend of Karlee's, a smart _sircar_,[10] in the\r\nemploy of a _banyan_,[11] the bhearer resting strictly in the\r\nbackground, a silent partner, and limiting his co-operation to the\r\nprompt furnishing of capital, which consisted not of rupees merely, but\r\nof many a cunning hint as well, as to the tastes, ways, and weaknesses\r\nof his customers. It was a mutual understanding: we knew of Karlee's\r\ninterest in these sentimental \"operations,\" and we openly patronized\r\nhim; he knew which of us had wives, and which sweethearts, across the\r\nblack water, and he mysteriously patronized us. On that subject my\r\nheathen was always at home; and so it happened, by a happy dispensation\r\nof cause and effect, that at home he lived like a gentleman.\r\n\r\nThrough narrow, dingy miles of scrambling bazaar, redolent of all the\r\nunfragrances of that dusty, sweaty, greasy, jabbering quarter, I rolled\r\nin my light buggy, behind a nimble Arab mare, to a suburban retreat on\r\nthe eastern skirt of the Black Town, where, just beyond a cluster of\r\nmean huts of the _sooa-logue_, the low laboring rabble, I found Karlee's\r\ngenteel abode, and was refreshed by the contrast it presented to the\r\nhovel of his next neighbor, whose single windowless apartment, and walls\r\nof alternate rows of straw and reeds, plastered with mud, proclaimed\r\nmost unpicturesquely the hard fate of him who springs from the soles of\r\nBrahma's feet. Karlee's walls were of solid clay of substantial\r\nthickness. His floor was raised a foot or two above the ground, and\r\nthere was a neatly thatched roof over all, swelling out in an elongated\r\ndome, and oddly resembling an inverted boat. As in the rural districts,\r\nKarlee had fenced in his privacy with a thick hedge of clipped bamboo\r\nsurmounting a quadrangular embankment. Before the grateful porch two\r\nbeautiful tamarind-trees and a palm bestowed their kindly shade, and in\r\nthe hedge the bamboos, with their golden stems and bright green leaves,\r\nrustled cheerfully.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the road, and shyly retired from it in a close\r\nbamboo covert, dwelt Karlee's partner in the curiosity and general fancy\r\nline, the sharp sircar, with whom (both being _soodras_,[12] and of the\r\nsame sect) his social relations were intimate and free. The sircar,\r\nhaving thriven under the patronage of more than one rich and liberal\r\n_baboo_,[13] to whose favor he had recommended himself by his business\r\nalertness and his ever-politic compliance, had attained unto the honor\r\nof a brick house of two stories, plastered and whitewashed without and\r\nwithin, with a flat roof, having a low parapet, and laid with a\r\nrain-proof composition of clay and lime. Though his stairs are narrow,\r\nhis veranda is commodious; and when he shall have made his fortune in\r\nthe curiosity and general fancy line, he will have wings, with a\r\ncentral area open to the sky, and a double veranda with a lattice. Then,\r\nhis accommodations being sufficiently enlarged, the proudest wish of his\r\nheart shall be gratified in the reunion of his entire family--children\r\nand grandchildren, even uncles and aunts, nephews and nieces--under the\r\nsame roof.\r\n\r\nAs I drove up to Karlee's hedge, and, tossing the reins to my\r\n_syce_,[14] passed under the tamarind-trees to the little porch, the old\r\nman came out to meet me with unwonted precipitation; and, although he\r\nmaintained with admirable presence of mind that imperturbable gravity,\r\nthat tranquil, expectant self-possession, which is the study of a\r\nHindoo's life, and to which he gives all his mind from the time when he\r\nfirst begins to have any, ever solicitous to be master of himself though\r\nChina fall, it was not difficult on this occasion to detect in the\r\nfluttering lights and shades of his countenance an expression mixed of\r\nastonishment, gratification, and confusion, very natural to a poor\r\nbhearer who had never before been taken by a Sahib in the very bosom of\r\nhis family. There was something at once pitiful and comical in the\r\nsubdued \"fidget\" with which, applying his joined palms to his forehead,\r\nand lowly louting, he made his most obsequious salaam again and again.\r\n\r\n\"Master have command for Karlee? Any wrong thing happen, master?\r\n_Dhobee_[15] come? _Mehtur_[16] not sweep room? _Punka-wallah_[17] run\r\naway? Sahibs make visit? _Kitmudgar_ not--\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no; everything all right and proper. I have come to bring good\r\nwishes and a lucky eye to all this house, and a small _salaamee_, a\r\npretty gift, for the new _Suntoshum_,--the jewel that hangs on its\r\nmother's bosom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! master make slave too much happy honor. Master's pitiful\r\ngraciousness all same _Barra Lard Sahib_\" (the Governor-General). \"Poor,\r\nfoolish bhearer kiss master's feet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, another time for that. Lead the way now, and let me make my\r\nsalaam to your coolest mat and your largest punka, for I am hot and\r\ntired.\"\r\n\r\n\"S'pose Sahib like, _Belatta pawnee_ have got?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Acha; Belatta pawnee lou_.\"[18]\r\n\r\nHere, indeed, was a wide stride in the direction of refinement and\r\nEvangelism! Soda-water in a bhearer's house! Karlee had not served the\r\nSahibs, and observed \"Young Bengal\" baboos, in vain. From _Belatta\r\npawnee_ to Isherryshrob and Simpkin (sherry and champagne) is not far,\r\nand well does Young Bengal know the way.\r\n\r\nA quick glance, as I passed in, informed me that Karlee's house\r\nconsisted of four rooms; probably two sleeping apartments, one for the\r\nmen and another for the women, a kitchen, and a common room for meals,\r\nfamily chats, and visitors. Like all true Hindoo houses, uncorrupted by\r\nthe European innovations which snobbish baboos affect, it contained but\r\nfew articles of furniture, and those of the simplest and most\r\nindispensable description,--nothing for luxury, nothing for show. To the\r\noutfit of the poorest laborer's domicile he added little more than a\r\nwhite cloth spread over checkered Chinese matting, to stand for chair,\r\ntable, and bed; a cushion or two to recline upon; a few earthen vessels\r\nof the better quality, to hold rice or water; a brass lamp for cocoa-nut\r\noil; several more primitive lamps rudely made of the shell of the\r\ncocoa-nut; an iron mortar and pestle--foreign, of course--for pounding\r\ncurry; a couple of _charpoys_, or wooden cots; a few brass _lotahs_, or\r\ndrinking-cups; and two or three hubble-bubbles. But the crowning glories\r\nwere a Chinese extension chair, of bamboo and wicker, and quite a pretty\r\nhookah,--both evidently dedicated to company occasions. These were all\r\nthat I could see in the two rooms to which I was admitted, and these\r\nwere no doubt the very splendors of Karlee's establishment. If he had\r\nbeen a rich Anglicized baboo, he would have had a profusion of hot,\r\ntawdry chairs, and a vulgar-gorgeous cramming of gilt-edged tables,\r\nsweaty red sofas, coarse pictures in overdone frames, Bowery mirrors,\r\nand Brummagem chandeliers.\r\n\r\nComfortably installed in the Chinese chair, and refreshed with the\r\nBelatta pawnee, I proceeded to take notes. Karlee had discarded his\r\nworking dress for festal attire,--the difference being one of quality\r\nmerely. Round his waist he wore a _dhotee_ of coarse muslin, tight\r\nabove, so as to form the _kummerbund_, or waistband, but thence falling\r\nin loose and not ungraceful folds down the legs to the ankles. Over his\r\nbody another ample mantle, in no respect differing from the _dhotee_ as\r\nto texture or color, was wrapped like a broad scarf, and carelessly\r\nflung over the shoulder in the fashion of a Highland plaid. In the\r\n\"cold\" season he would draw this over his head for a hood. These sheets\r\nof cloth are worn just as they come from the loom; needle or pin has\r\nnever touched them, and they are held in place by tucking the ends under\r\nthe folds.\r\n\r\nBeing a Hindoo gentleman of the old school, Karlee repudiated the\r\nheaddress at home; for the _puggree_, at least in its present form, was\r\nadopted from the Mohammedan conquerors, and is, historically, a badge of\r\nsubjugation. So when he met me at the door his head was uncovered; but I\r\nhad no sooner crossed the threshold than he made haste to don his flat\r\nturban,--reflecting, perhaps, that I had never seen him without it, and\r\nmight resent his bare head as an indignity. Of course his feet were\r\nunshod. To have worn his sandals in my presence would have been a\r\nflagrant insult; but on the porch I espied those two queer clogs of\r\nwood, shaped to the sole of the foot, and having no other fastening than\r\nan impracticable-looking knob, to be held between the toes.\r\n\r\nThis is the orthodox Hindoo dress; but the costume for public occasions\r\nof many Hindoos of rank has been for a quarter of a century in a state\r\nof transition from Mohammedan to British. By way of turbans, loose\r\ntrousers, Cashmere shawls, and embroidered slippers, they are marching\r\non toward pantaloons, waistcoats, shoes and stockings, stove-pipe hats,\r\nand tail-coats. A baboo of superlative fashion, according to the code of\r\nYoung Bengal, paid me a visit one day in a state of confirmed \"pants\"\r\nand \"Congress gaiters\"; and, on seating himself, he took off his turban\r\nand held it on his knee. I need hardly say that he was a fool and an\r\ninfidel. And I have seen an intrepid buffoon of this class in an English\r\nshirt, which he wore over his pantaloons, and hanging down to his knees.\r\nBut, after all, these clumsy desecrations are confined to a small\r\nminority of the population, if not strictly to that \"set\" which is\r\nbrought most closely in contact with Europeans; such as a few native\r\ngentlemen in the Presidency capitals, some of the pleaders and principal\r\n_employés_ of the higher courts, not a few of the teachers and pupils in\r\nthe Anglo-Indian schools, and many of the native Christians.\r\n\r\nKarlee's politeness, superior to that of the more servile bhearers, was\r\na fair type of the pure Hindoo manners of that well-bred middle class\r\nwhich clings with orthodox conservatism to its dear traditions, and\r\nspurns as unconstitutional all upstart and dandy amendments of the old\r\nsocial and religious law. He had invariably one salutation for an\r\nequal,--the right hand gently raised, and the head as gently inclined to\r\nmeet it; another, for what I may term a familiar superior (such as\r\nmyself),--the hands joined palm to palm, and so applied twice or thrice\r\nto the forehead; and still other, and more and more reverential,\r\nceremonials for _gooroos_, Brahmins, holy sages, and princes,--the brow\r\ntouching the ground, or the whole body prostrated.\r\n\r\nIf it was an indispensable requirement of respect that he should leave\r\nhis slippers at the door on entering any house, it was no less important\r\nthat he should resume them on taking his leave. To have appeared in\r\npublic with uncovered feet would have been a gross breach of propriety.\r\nFine old Hindoo gentlemen, all of the olden time, find it difficult to\r\nexpress their mingled contempt, indignation, and regret for the\r\ninnovation which substitutes the Cheapside shoe for the ceremonial\r\nslipper, or permits the wearing of the latter in a Sahib's office or\r\ndrawing-room. It shows, they say, that the natives are losing their\r\nrespect for the Sahibs. And yet the British authorities stupidly\r\nsanction it, even set the seal of fashion upon it, by allowing natives\r\nof rank, who visit Government House, to appear in the presence of the\r\nGovernor-General, and the _élite_ of the European society, in their\r\nslippers. The fact is, these impious disturbings of the established\r\norder of things are most shocking to the well-regulated heathen mind, to\r\nwhich no spectacle can be more monstrous than that of a Hindoo of good\r\ncaste and old family performing with some arf-and-arf Cockney visitor a\r\nduet on the pump-handle, and directly afterward wreathing his apoplectic\r\nneck with flowers, and sprinkling his asthmatic waistcoat with\r\nrose-water. You see they both back \"Young Bengal\" in the Barrackpore\r\nraces.\r\n\r\nWhen Karlee visits his friend the sircar, he is scrupulous not to make\r\nhis parting salaam until his host has given the customary signal. He\r\nwaits to be dismissed, or rather to receive permission to withdraw. The\r\netiquette supposes that his inclination is to prolong the enjoyment he\r\nderives from the society of so agreeable a gentleman; it is, therefore,\r\nnot until rose-water has been presented to him, or betel-leaf, or\r\nsweetmeats, that he will venture to take his sandals and his leave.\r\n\r\nThe style of Hindoo politeness is format and imperturbably grave,\r\nutterly devoid of heartiness or impulsiveness; and the cordiality which\r\ndistinguishes the intercourse of American friends appears to the native\r\ngentleman boisterous and vulgar. I never saw Karlee laugh; and if I had\r\nhappened to snatch him from sudden death by fire or water, I think he\r\nwould have acknowledged the obligation with precisely the same\r\nmathematical salaam, or at most the same sententious obsequiousness,\r\nwith which he accepted a buksheesh of a half-rupee; and yet in both\r\ngood-humor and gratitude he was as cheerful and as worthy as the most\r\ngiddy and gushing of damsels. But I must acknowledge there was something\r\ntruly corpsy in the solemnity with which he would \"lay out\" a clean\r\nshirt. Even so, in the midst of all the jolly uproar of a mess dinner,\r\nour Kitmudgars would stand in grim deadliness at our backs, like so many\r\nexecutioners, only waiting for a sign from the ruthless Kousomar, who\r\nwas just then horribly popping the champagne corks, to behead us,--each\r\nhis own doomed Sahib.\r\n\r\nNo wonder Karlee was a gentleman; for the Vishnu Pooran was his\r\nChesterfield, and he had its precepts by heart. \"A wise man,\" he would\r\nsay to the pert young Kitmudgars, as they bragged and wrangled, between\r\ntheir hubble-bubbles, on the back stairs,--\"a wise man will never\r\naddress another with the least unkindness; but will always speak gently,\r\nand with truth, and never make public another's faults. He will never\r\nengage in a dispute with either his superiors or his inferiors:\r\ncontroversy and marriage are permitted only between equals. Nor will he\r\never associate with wicked persons: half an instant is the utmost time\r\nhe should allow himself to remain in their company. A wise man, when\r\nsitting, will not put one foot over the other, nor stretch forth his\r\nfoot in the presence of a superior; but he will sit with modesty, in the\r\nposture styled _virasama_. Above all, he will not expectorate at the\r\ntime of eating, offering oblations, or repeating prayers, or in the\r\npresence of any respectable person; nor will he ever cross the shadow of\r\na venerable man or of an idol.\"\r\n\r\nFor those who imagine that polygamy is a popular institution in\r\nHindostan, the answer of a Hill-man to a Mofussil magistrate should\r\nsuffice. \"Do you keep more than one wife?\" \"We can hardly feed one; why\r\nshould we keep more?\" In fact, the privilege of maintaining a plurality\r\nof wives is restricted to a very few,--those only of the largest means\r\nand smallest scruples,--except in the case of _Kooleen_ Brahmins, that\r\nsuperlative aristocracy of caste which is supposed to be descended from\r\ncertain illustrious families who settled in Bengal several centuries\r\nago. Wealthy Hindoos of low degree eagerly aspire to the honor of mixing\r\ntheir puddle blood with the quintessentially clarified fluid that\r\nglorifies the circulatory systems of these demigods, and the result is a\r\nvery pretty and profitable branch of the Brahmin business,--_Kooleen_\r\nmarrying sometimes as many as fifty of such nut-brown maids of baser\r\nbirth, in consideration of a substantial dowry attached to each bride,\r\nand a solemn obligation, accepted and signed by the paternal Puddle,\r\nforever to feed at home her and her improved progeny. So the fifty\r\ncontinue to roost in the old paternal coops, while Kooleen, like a\r\npampered Brahmapootra, struts, in pompous patronage, from one to the\r\nother, his sense of duty satisfied when he has left a crow and a cackle\r\nbehind him. It is said that many fine fowls of the Brahmin breed, who do\r\nnot happen to be Kooleens, complain of the monopoly.\r\n\r\nSo Karlee had but one wife,--the handy, thrifty ayah already mentioned.\r\nShe was nine and he twelve years old when they were betrothed, and they\r\nnever saw each other until they were married. A professional\r\nmatch-maker, or go-between,--female, of course,--was employed by the\r\nparents to negotiate terms and arrange the preliminaries; and when\r\nhoroscopes had been compared and the stars found all right, with a\r\nlittle consequential chaffering, the hymeneal instruments were\r\n\"executed.\" There was no trouble on the score of caste, both families\r\nbeing soodra; otherwise, the sensitive social balance would have had to\r\nbe adjusted by the payment of a sum of money. When the skirts of the\r\nbride and bridegroom had been fastened together with blades of the\r\nsweet-scented cusa grass,--when he had said, \"May that heart which is\r\nthine become my heart, and this heart which is mine become thy\r\nheart,\"--when, hand in hand, they had stept into the seventh of the\r\nmystic circles,--Mr. and Mrs. Karlee were an accomplished Hindoo fact.\r\n\r\nTo the parents on both sides, the wedding was a costly performance.\r\nThere were the irrepressible and voracious Brahmins to propitiate, the\r\nhungry friends of both families to feast for three days, the musicians\r\nand the nautch-girls and the _tamasha-wallahs_[19] to be bountifully\r\nbuksheeshed; and when the bridal palanquin was borne homeward, it was a\r\nhigh-priced indispensability that the procession should satisfy the best\r\nsoodra society,--\r\n\r\n    \"With the yellow torches gleaming,\r\n    And the scarlet mantles streaming,\r\n    And the canopy above\r\n    Swaying as they slowly move.\"\r\n\r\nKarlee has assured me that neither his father nor his father-in-law,\r\nalthough both were soodras of fair credit and condition, ever quite\r\nrecovered from the financial shock of that \"awspidges okashn.\"\r\n\r\nA Hindoo very rarely pronounces the name of his wife, even to his most\r\nintimate friends,--to strangers, and especially foreigners, never; on\r\nthe part of a native visitor it is the etiquette to ignore her\r\naltogether, and for the husband to allude to her familiarly is an\r\nunpardonable breach of decorum. When, therefore, Karlee, to gratify my\r\nfriendly curiosity, led in the happy grandmother, I felt that I was the\r\nrecipient of an extraordinary mark of respect and confidence, involving\r\na generous sacrifice of prejudice. As she made her modest salaam, and,\r\nin the manner of a shy child, sank to the floor in the habitual posture\r\nof an ayah, I had before me the well-preserved remains of a Hindoo\r\nbeauty, according to the standard of the Shasters,--a placid, reposeful\r\nwoman, almost fat, with rather delicate features of Rajpoot fairness,\r\nthe complexion of high caste, wealth, and ease, such as her\r\nless-favored sisters vainly strive to imitate with a sort of saffron\r\n_rouge_. Her expression was chaste and gentle, her voice dulcet; and to\r\nthe practice of carrying light burdens on her head she was indebted for\r\na carriage erect and graceful. On Broadway or Tremont Street, Mrs.\r\nKarlee would have passed for a very comely colored woman. If she was not\r\nlike Rama, fair as the jasmine, or the moon, or the fibres of the lotos,\r\nneither had she, like Krishna, the complexion of a cloud. If she was not\r\nso delicate as that dainty beauty who bewitched the hard heart of\r\nSurajah Dowlah, and weighed but sixty-four pounds, neither did she\r\nreproduce the unwieldy charms of that Venus of one of the Shasters\r\n\"whose gait was the gait of a drunken elephant or a goose.\" A prudent\r\nman, says the Vishnoo Pooran, will not marry a woman who has a beard, or\r\none who has thick ankles, or one who speaks with a shrill voice, or one\r\nwho croaks like a raven, or one whose eyebrows meet, or one whose teeth\r\nresemble tusks. And Karlee was a prudent man.\r\n\r\nFrom the extravagant and clumsy complications, the stupid caprices and\r\ndiscords, and studious indecencies of our women's fashions, to the\r\nprudent simplicity, the unconscious poetry and picturesqueness and\r\nmusically blended modesty and freedom of the good ayah's unchangeable\r\nattire, my thought reverts with a mingled sense of refreshment and\r\nregret. A single web of cloth, eight or nine yards long, having a narrow\r\nblue border, was drawn in self-forming folds around her shoulders and\r\nbosom, and hung down to her feet,--the material muslin, the texture\r\nsomewhat coarse, the color white. No dressmaker had ever played\r\nfantastic tricks with it: it was pure and simple in its entireness as it\r\ncame from the loom.\r\n\r\nOther women, of the laboring class, and very poor, passed to and fro on\r\nthe street, half naked, their legs and shoulders bare, and with only a\r\npiece of dirty cloth--blue, red, or yellow--around the loins and hips;\r\nwhile here and there some superfine baboo's wife floated past in her\r\nclose palanquin, or sat with her children on the flat roof of her house,\r\nor peeped through her narrow windows into the street, arrayed in fancy\r\nbodice and petticoat,--Mohammedan fashion.\r\n\r\nBut the simplicity of Mrs. Karlee's attire began and ended with her\r\ndrapery. Her ornaments were cumbersome, clumsy, and grotesque. On her\r\narms and ankles were many fetter-like bands of silver and copper; rude\r\nrings of gold and silver adorned her fingers and great toes; small\r\nsilver coins were twisted in her hair; and the naturally delicate\r\noutline of her lips was deformed by a broad gold ring, which she wore,\r\nlike a fractious ox, in her nose. This latter vanity is as precious as\r\nit is ugly; in some of the minor castes its absence is regarded as a\r\nbadge of widowhood; and for no inducement would the pious ayah have\r\nremoved it from its place, even for an instant. Had it fallen, by any\r\ndreadful chance, the house would have been filled with horror and\r\nlamentation. The half-naked wife of my syce rejoices in a nose-ring of\r\nbrass or pewter, and her wrists and ankles are gay with hoops of painted\r\nshell-lac; and even she stains her eyelids with lampblack, and tinges\r\nher nails with henna. Much lovelier was our pretty ayah in her\r\nmaidenhood, when her dainty bosom was decked with shells and\r\nsweet-scented flowers, and her raven hair lighted up with sprays of the\r\nIndian jasmine, which first she had offered to Seeta.\r\n\r\nBut that reminds me that, when I approached her, and presented the\r\nstring of corals, my small _salaamee_, and bade Karlee tell her that it\r\nwas for the baby,--for she understood not a word of English,--and that I\r\nwished him happy stars and a good name, riches and honors, and a\r\nhouseful of sons,--she uttered not a word; but with eyes brimming with\r\ngratitude, flattered to tears, by a sudden graceful movement she touched\r\nmy foot with her hand and immediately laid it on her head,--and then,\r\nwith many shy and mute, but eloquent salaams, retired. It is difficult\r\nto imagine such a woman scolding and slang-whanging as low Hindoo women\r\ndo, accompanying with passionate attitudes and gestures a reckless\r\ntorrent of words, and fitting the foulest action to the most scandalous\r\nepithet.\r\n\r\nThe wives of the native servants are generally industrious. This one,\r\nKarlee boasted, was a notable housewife. Before she went out to service\r\nas an ayah she had cleaned the rice, pounded the curry, cooked all the\r\nmeals, brought water from the tank in earthen jars on her head, swept\r\nand scrubbed the floor, cultivated a small kitchen garden, \"shopped\" at\r\nthe bazaar, spun endless supplies of cotton thread on a very primitive\r\nreel, consisting of a piece of wire with a ball of clay at the end of\r\nit, which she twirled with one hand while she fed it with the other; and\r\nevery morning she bathed in the Hooghly, and returned home before\r\ndaybreak. Sewing and knitting were unknown arts to her,--she had no use\r\nfor either; and her washing and ironing were done by a hired dhobee.\r\n\r\nTrue, it was not permitted to her to eat with her husband; when Karlee\r\ndined she sat at the respectful orthodox distance, and waited; and if at\r\nany time they walked out together, ayah must keep her legal place in the\r\nrear. Saith the Shaster, \"Is it not the practice of women of immaculate\r\nchastity to eat after their lords have eaten, to sleep only after they\r\nhave slept, and to rise from sleep before them?\" And again, \"Let a wife\r\nwho wishes to perform sacred ablution wash the feet of her lord, and\r\ndrink the water.\" Nevertheless, ayah exercised an influence over her\r\nhusband as decided as it was wholesome; she did not hesitate to rebuke\r\nhim when occasion required; and in all that related to the moral\r\ngovernment of her children she was free to dispute his authority, and\r\ntry parental conclusions with him,--kindly but firmly. As for \"the\r\ntyrannical immuring of the Oriental female,\" the cruel caging of the\r\npretty birds who are supposed to be forever longing and pining for the\r\ngossip of the _ghaut_ and the bustle of the bazaar, the only fault she\r\nhad to find with it was that she did not get enough of it. The\r\nwell-trained Hindoo woman has been taught to regard such seclusion as\r\nher most charming compliment, and a precious proof of her husband's\r\naffection; to be kept jealously veiled from the staring world, is\r\nassociated in her mind with ideas of wealth and rank,--it is the very\r\naristocracy of fashion.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Code of Menyu, \"a believer in Scripture may receive\r\npure knowledge even from a soodra, a lesson of the highest virtue even\r\nfrom a chandala, and a woman bright as a gem even from the lowest\r\nfamily.\" So if Karlee's wife, instead of being of the same social rank\r\nas himself, had come of basest caste, she would still have been a\r\ntreasure. Soon after she had retired, she gently pushed into the room,\r\nto pay his respects to the Sahib, a shy little boy of five years, whom\r\nKarlee presented to me as the child of his only son, a bhearer in the\r\nservice of an English officer stationed at Fort William. The mother had\r\ndied in blessing her husband with this bright little puttro. In costume\r\nhe was the exact miniature of his grandfather, except that he wore no\r\npuggree, and his hair was cut short round the forehead in a quaint\r\nfrill, like the small boys one sees running about the streets in Orissa.\r\nHis ankles, too, were loaded with massive silver rings, which noticeably\r\nimpeded the childish freedom of his steps. When he has begun to\r\nunderstand what the word \"wife\" means, these must be laid aside. In his\r\nmanners, likewise, little Karlee was the very tautology of his namesake\r\nwith the gray moustache,--the same wary self-possession, the same\r\nimmovable gravity and nice decorum. Like a little courtier, he made his\r\nsmall salaam, and through his grandfather replied to some playful\r\nquestions I addressed to him, with good emphasis and discretion, without\r\neither awkwardness or boldness, and especially without a smile. When I\r\ngave him a rupee, he construed it as the customary signal, and with\r\nanother small salaam immediately dismissed himself.\r\n\r\nLittle Karlee must have taken lessons in deportment with his primal pap;\r\nand in India all good little boys, who hope to go to heaven when they\r\ndie, keep their noses clean, and never romp or whistle. As to girls it\r\nmatters less; the midwife gets only half price for consummating that\r\nsort of blunder; for when you are dead only a son can carry you out and\r\nbury you _dacent_,--no daughter, though she pray with the power and\r\nperseverance of the Seven Penitents, can procure you a respectable\r\nmetempsychosis.\r\n\r\nSo far little Karlee had been lucky. This house, where he was born, was\r\nlucky,--no one had ever died in it. When his dear mother could not spin\r\nany more, they carried her to the Hooghly on a charpoy, and she had\r\nbreathed her last on the banks of the sacred river. Besides, his\r\ngrandfather had immediately stuck up a cooking-pot, striped with\r\nperpendicular white lines, on a pole at the side of the house; so _he_\r\nhad never been in any danger from malicious incantations and the Evil\r\nEye. His education had been begun on a propitious day, else he might\r\nhave died or turned out a dunce. The very day he was born, a Brahmin--O\r\n_so_ pious!--had hung a charm round his neck, and only charged grandpa\r\nfifty rupees for it; when he went to the bazaar with his grandmother he\r\nwas always dressed in rags, to avert envy, and no one out of the family\r\nknew his real name except his gooroo; all the other boys, and the\r\nneighbors, called him Teencowry (three cowries[20]),--such a nice mean\r\nname against spells and cross-eyed people! Once a strange Melican Sahib\r\nhad said, \"Hello, Buster!\" to him; but he wasn't at all frightened, for\r\nhis gooroo had taught him how to say a holy _mautra_[21] backwards; and\r\nwhen the Melican Sahib passed on, he spat on his shadow and said it.\r\nLast week a lizard dropped on his foot, and yesterday he saw a cow on\r\nhis right hand three times,--he had always been so lucky!\r\n\r\nNow, time, place, and mood being favorable, I called for the company\r\nhookah, and, extending the long Chinese chair, smoked myself to sleep\r\nunder the punka. My nap was a long one, and when I awoke there watched\r\nand waited Karlee, tenderly patient, with the fly-flapper.\r\n\r\nIn the hospitalities thus far so handsomely extended to me, the reader\r\nwill recognize and appreciate an extraordinary display of liberal ideas,\r\nfor which, however, considering the sound common sense of my\r\naffectionate old bhearer, I was not altogether unprepared; but when, his\r\nlittle grandson being gone, he conducted me into another room, to\r\npartake of what he humbly styled a _chota khana_, a trifle of luncheon,\r\nmy astonishment exceeded my gratification. I doubt if such a thing had\r\never before happened in the life of a bhearer.\r\n\r\nOn the floor a broad sheet, of spotless whiteness, was spread, and\r\nbeside it a narrow mattress of striped seersucker, very clean and cool,\r\nand with a double cushion at the head to support the elbow; on this my\r\nhost invited me to recline. Here then were table and chair, but as yet\r\nthe board was bare. Presently little Karlee reappeared, bringing a great\r\nround hand-punka, formed of a single huge palm-leaf, and, standing\r\nbehind my shoulder, began to fan me solemnly. Immediately there was a\r\nsubdued and mysterious clapping of hands, and the old man, going to the\r\ndoor, received, from behind the red curtain which hung across it, a bowl\r\nof coarse unglazed earthenware, but smoking and savory, which he set\r\nbefore me, together with a smaller bowl of the same material, empty; and\r\nto my lively surprise these were followed by English bunns and pickles,\r\na jar of chutney, a bottle of Allsop's ale, my own silver beer-mug,\r\nknives and forks, table and dessert spoons, fruit-knife, and\r\nnapkin,--all from our quarters in Cossitollah, two miles away. By what\r\nconjuration and mighty magic Karlee had procured these from my kitmudgar\r\nwithout a _chittee_, or order, I have not yet discovered.\r\n\r\nThe tureen contained delicious Mulligatawney soup, of which, as Karlee\r\nwell knew, I was inordinately fond; and as he opened the ale he modestly\r\ncongratulated himself on my vigorous enjoyment of it.\r\n\r\nAfter the soup came curried prawns, a very piquant dish, in eminent\r\nrepute among the Sahibs, and a famous appetizer. Tonic, hot, and pungent\r\nas it is, with spices, betel, and chillies, it is hard to imagine what\r\nthe torpid livers of the Civil Service would do without their rousing\r\ncurry.\r\n\r\nThe curry was followed by a tender _bouilli_ of kid, sauced with a\r\ndelicate sort of onions stewed in ghee (boiled butter), and flanked with\r\nboiled rice, sweet pumpkin, and fried bananas, all served on green\r\nleaves. Next came pine-apple, covered with sherry-wine and sugar, in\r\ncompany with English walnuts and cheese; and, last of all, sweetmeats\r\nand coffee,--the former a not unpleasant compound of ground rice and\r\nsugar with curds and the crushed kernel of the cocoa-nut; the coffee was\r\nserved in a diminutive gourd, and was not sweetened. Last of the last,\r\nthe hookah.\r\n\r\nAnd all these wonders had been wrought since the grateful ayah retired\r\nwith the corals! But then the bazaar was close at hand, and in the\r\nsircar's house help was handy.\r\n\r\nWhilst I kanahed[22] and smoked, Karlee, humbly \"squatting\" at my back,\r\nallowed me to draw from him all that I have here related of his house\r\nand family, and much more that I have not space to relate. Of course, he\r\ncould not have shared the repast with me,--all the holy water of Ganges\r\ncould never have washed out so deep a defilement,--but he accompanied my\r\nhookah with his hubble-bubble. The reader has observed that, although\r\nthe viands were choice enough, they were laid on the cheapest pottery,\r\nand even on leaves, that the plate from which I ate was of unglazed\r\nearthenware, and that the coffee was served in a gourd. This was in\r\norder that they might be at once destroyed. By no special dispensation\r\ncould those vessels ever again be purified for the use of a respectable\r\nHindoo; even a pariah would have felt insulted if he had been asked to\r\neat from them; and if the knives and forks and spoons had not been my\r\nown, they must have shared the fate of the platters. But this prejudice\r\nmust be taken in a Pickwickian sense,--it covered no objection simply\r\npersonal to the Sahib. In some castes it is forbidden to eat from any\r\nplate twice, even in the strictest privacy of the family; and many\r\nnatives, however wealthy, scrupulously insist upon leaves. All\r\nrespectable Hindoos lift their food with their fingers, using neither\r\nknife, fork, nor spoon; and for this purpose they employ the right hand\r\nonly, the left being reserved for baser purposes. In drinking water,\r\nmany of them will not allow the _lotah_ to touch the lips; but, throwing\r\nthe head back, and holding the vessel at arm's length on high, with an\r\nodd expertness they let the water run into their mouths. The sect of\r\nRamanujas obstinately refuse to sit down to a meal while any one is\r\nstanding by or looking on; nor will they chew betel in company with a\r\nman of low caste. Ward has written, \"If a European of the highest rank\r\ntouch the food of a Hindoo of the lowest caste, the latter will\r\ninstantly throw it away, although he may not have another morsel to\r\nallay the pangs of hunger\";--but this is true only of certain very\r\nstrait sects. There are numerous sects that admit proselytes from every\r\ncaste; but at the same time they will not partake of food, except with\r\nthose of their own religious party. \"Here,\" says Kerr, \"the spirit of\r\nsect has supplanted even the spirit of caste,\"--as at the temple of\r\nJuggernath in Orissa, where the pilgrims of all castes take their\r\n_khana_ in common.\r\n\r\nAt our quarters in Cossitollah even this progressive Karlee will not\r\ntaste of the food which has been served at our mess-table, though it be\r\nreturned to the kitchen untouched. But at least he is consistent; for\r\nneither will he take medicine from the hand of a Sahib, however ill he\r\nmay be; nor have I ever known him to decline or postpone the performance\r\nof this or that duty because it was Sunday,--as many knavish bhearers do\r\nwhen they have set their hearts on a cock-fight. To compound for sins\r\none is inclined to, by damning those one has no mind to, it is not\r\nindispensable that one should be a Christian.\r\n\r\nThe amiable Mr. James Kerr, of the Hindoo College of Calcutta, has\r\ncontrived an ingenious and plausible apology for the constitutional (or\r\ngeographical) laziness of Bengalese servants. He says: \"A love of repose\r\nmay be considered one of the most striking features in the character of\r\nthe people of India. The Hindoos may be said to have deified this state.\r\nTheir favorite notion of a Supreme Being is that of one who reposes in\r\nhimself, in a dream of absolute quiescence. This idea is, doubtless, in\r\nthe first instance, a reflection of their own character; but, in\r\nwhatever way it originated, it tends to sanctify in their eyes a state\r\nof repose. When removed from this world of care, their highest hope is\r\nto become a part of the great Quiescent. It will naturally appear to\r\nthem the best preparation for the repose of a future life to cultivate\r\nrepose in this.\" Therefore, if your kitmudgar, nodding behind your\r\nchair, permits his astonished fly-flapper to become a part of the great\r\nQuiescent, or if your punka-wallah, having subsided into a comatose\r\nbeatitude, suddenly invites his compliant machine to repose in himself,\r\nin a dream of absolute stagnation, with the thermometer at 120° outside\r\nthe refrigerator, you must not say, \"Damn that boy,--he's asleep\r\nagain!\"--but patiently survey and intelligently admire the spiritual\r\nprocesses by which an exalted sentient force prepares itself for the\r\nrepose of a future life. But our reckless Karlee took no thought for the\r\neverlasting rest into which his soul should enter \"when removed from\r\nthis world of care,\" according to the ingenious psychological system of\r\nthe amiable Kerr Sahib; for when he had anything to do, he kept on doing\r\nit until it was done, and when he caught the punka-wallah reposing in a\r\ndream of absolute quiescence, he bumped his head against the wall, and\r\ncalled him a _sooa_, and a _banchut_, and a _junglee-wallah_.[23]\r\n\r\nThough possessed of a lively imagination and all his race's sympathy\r\nwith what is vast, though he saw nothing extravagant in the Hindoo\r\nchronology, nor aught that was monstrous in Hindoo mythology, Karlee yet\r\nserved to illustrate the arguments of those who contend that Hindoos\r\nneed not necessarily be all boasters, servile liars, and flatterers. He\r\nwas not forever saying, \"Master very wise man; master all time do good;\r\nmaster all time ispeak right.\" He never told me that my words were\r\npearls and diamonds that I dropped munificently from my mouth.

The millionnaire\r\n          Without such boon is bare,\r\n    Bare to the skin,--a gilded tavern-sign\r\n          Creaking with fitful whine\r\n    Beneath chill winds, with none to look at him\r\n          Save as a label grim\r\n    To the good cheer and company within\r\n          His comfortable inn.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE SINGING-SCHOOL ROMANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFather sits at the head of our pew. In old Indian times they say that\r\nthe male head of the family always took that place, on account of the\r\npossible _whoops_ of the savages, who sometimes came down on a\r\ncongregation like wolves on the fold. It was necessary that the men\r\nshould be ready to rise at once to defend their families. Whatever the\r\nold reason was, the new is sufficient. Men must sit near the pew doors\r\nnow on account of the _hoops_ of the ladies. The cause is different, the\r\neffect is the same.\r\n\r\nFather, then, sits at the head of the pew; mother next; Aunt Clara next;\r\nnext I, and then Jerusha. That has been the arrangement ever since I can\r\nremember. Any change in our places would be as fatal to our devotions as\r\nthe dislodgment of Baron Rothschild from his particular pillar was once\r\nto the business of the London Stock Exchange. He could not negotiate if\r\nnot at his post. We could not worship if not in our precise places. I\r\nthink, by the fussing and fidgeting which taking seats in the church\r\nalways causes, that everybody has the same feeling.\r\n\r\nIt was Sunday afternoon. The good minister, Parson Oliver, had finished\r\nhis sermon. The text was--well, I can't pretend to remember. Aunt\r\nClara's behavior in meeting, and what she said to us that afternoon,\r\nhave put the text, sermon, and all out of my head forever. That is no\r\nmatter; or rather, it is all the better; for when the same sermon comes\r\nagain, in its triennial round, I shall not recognize an old\r\nacquaintance.\r\n\r\nThe sermon finished, we took up our hymn-books, of course. But the\r\nminister gave out no hymn. He sat down with a patient look at the choir,\r\nas much as to say, \"Now, do your worst!\" Then we understood that we\r\nwere to be treated to an extra performance, not in our books. There had\r\nbeen a renewal of interest in the choir, and there was a new\r\nsinging-master. We were to have the results of the late practisings and\r\nthe first fruits of the new school. The piece they sung was that in\r\nwhich occur the lines,--\r\n\r\n    \"I'd soar and touch the heavenly strings,\r\n    And vie with Gabriel, while he sings,\r\n      In notes almost divine!\"\r\n\r\nWe always, when we rise during the singing, face round to the choir. I\r\ndon't know why. Perhaps it is to complete our view of the congregation,\r\nsince during the rest of the time we look the other way, and, unless we\r\nfaced about, should see only half. I like to peep at father, to discover\r\nwhether he appreciates the performance. To-day he just turned his head\r\naway. Mother sat down. Aunt Clara looked straight ahead, and her\r\nold-fashioned bonnet hid her face; but I could discover that something\r\nmore than usual was working under her cap. I looked at every one of the\r\nsingers, and then at the players, from the big bass-viol down to the\r\ntenor, and not a bit of reason could I perceive for the twitter the\r\nheads of our pew had certainly got themselves into. There's a pattern\r\nold lady, Prudence Clark, presidentess of the Dorcas Society,--a\r\nspinster, just Aunt Clara's age,--a woman who knows everything, and more\r\ntoo. She sits in the pew before us. She turned her head and gave a sly\r\npeep at Aunt Clara. They both laughed in meeting. I know they did, and\r\nthey can't deny it. I peeped round at the minister, and, if he did not\r\nlaugh too, his face was scarlet, and he was taken with a wonderful fit\r\nof coughing. Such strange proceedings in meeting I never had seen. The\r\nminister, the deacon (father is a deacon), and the oldest members were\r\nsetting us young folks a very bad example. But we tolerate anything in\r\nour good old parson. He was a youth when our old folks were young, and\r\nas to us young folks, he remembers us longer than we do ourselves.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe were all home, and tea was over,--the early tea with substantials, as\r\nis the custom in the primitive districts of New England on Sunday\r\nafternoon. The double accumulation of dishes was disposed of; for at\r\nnoon we take a cold collation, doughnuts and cheese, and bread and\r\nbutter, and we never descend to servile employments till after tea. Then\r\nmany hands make light work. I suppose light work does not break the\r\nSabbath, especially as it is done in our Sunday best, with sleeves\r\ntucked up, and an extra apron.\r\n\r\nThe laughing in church was the point upon which, as yet, we had obtained\r\nno satisfaction. Jerusha and I, in an uncertain hope that we should find\r\nout something in due time, were discussing the music. The particular\r\npoint in debate was, why village choirs _will_ astonish the people with\r\npieces of music in which nobody can join them. We did not settle it, nor\r\nhas anybody ever solved the riddle that I know of. We don't even know\r\nwhether it comes under the ontological or psychological departments.\r\n(There, now! Haven't I brought in the famous words that our new\r\nschoolmaster astonished us with at the teachers' meeting? He need not\r\nthink that Webster Unabridged is his particular field, in which nobody\r\nelse may hunt.)\r\n\r\nWe were, as I said, discussing the music. Mother was flitting round,\r\ngiving the final dust-off and brush-about after our early tea. Aunt\r\nClara was sitting quietly at the window, pretending to read Baxter's\r\n\"Saint's Rest.\" Jerusha and I tried to imitate the tune, and we did it,\r\nas well as we could, and I am sure we are not bad singers. Mother\r\nslipped out of the room just as we came to\r\n\r\n    \"And vie with Gabriel, while he sings.\"\r\n\r\nShe ran as if something had stung her, and she was making for the\r\nhartshorn or some fresh brook-mud. Aunt Clara's face laughed all over,\r\nand I said:\r\n\r\n\"Come, now, Aunt Clara, you are really irreverent. You began laughing in\r\nmeeting, and you are keeping it up over that good book.\"\r\n\r\n\"Downright wicked,\" said Jerusha.\r\n\r\nNow I am a Normal graduate, and Jerusha is not yet \"finished.\" That will\r\naccount for the greater elegance of my expressions. Aunt Clara paid no\r\nheed to either of us, but laughed on. The most provoking thing in the\r\nworld is a laugh that you don't understand. Here was the whole Dorcas\r\nSociety laughing through its presidentess, and Aunt Clara joining in the\r\nlaugh in meeting, and aggravating the offence by stereotyping the smirk\r\nin her face. In came mother again, evidently afraid to stay out, and not\r\nliking for some reason to stay in. Again we tried the tune, and had just\r\ngot to\r\n\r\n    \"And vie with Gabriel, while he sings.\"\r\n\r\nUp jumped mother again, stopping in the door, and holding up a warning\r\nfinger to Aunt Clara. That gesture spurred my curiosity to the utmost\r\npoint. As to my beloved parent's running in and out, _that_ I should not\r\nhave heeded. She is like Martha, careful of many things. She is unlike\r\nMartha, for she wants no assistance; but when the rest of us are\r\ndisposed to be quiet, she _will_ keep flitting here and there, and is\r\nvexed if we follow. If father is talking, and has just reached the point\r\nof his story, off she goes, as if the common topic were nothing to her.\r\nFather says she is a perturbed spirit. But then he is always saying\r\nqueer things, which poor mother cannot understand. Aunt Clara seems to\r\nknow him a great deal better. I wonder he had not taken to wife a woman\r\nlike Aunt Clara. He would have taken _her_, I suppose, if she were not\r\nhis own sister.\r\n\r\nI besought mother, as she fled, to tell me what ailed aunty. \"Don't ask\r\n_me_,\" she answered. \"The dear only knows. As for me, I have given up\r\nthinking, let alone asking, what either your aunt or your father would\r\nbe at.\" And away she went, perturbed-spirit fashion, and Aunt Clara\r\nlaughed louder than ever. Indeed, before she had only chuckled and\r\nsilently shaken her sides; now she broke out into a scream.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I never!\" she said. \"That flounce of your mother's out of the\r\nroom was certainly as much like old times as if the thing had happened\r\nyesterday.\"\r\n\r\n\"What had happened yesterday?\" asked Jerusha and I, both in a breath.\r\n\r\n\"O, I _shall_ die of laughing,\" said Aunt Clara.\r\n\r\n\"We shall die of impatience,\" said I, \"if you don't tell us what you\r\nmean.\"\r\n\r\n\"No you won't. Nobody, especially no woman, ever yet died of unsatisfied\r\ncuriosity. It rather keeps folks alive.\"\r\n\r\nWe very well knew that nothing would be made of Aunt Clara by teasing\r\nher. So Jerusha turned over the great family Bible, her custom always of\r\na Sunday afternoon. Over her shoulder I happened to see that the good\r\nbook was open at the first chapter of I Chronicles, \"Adam,\r\nSheth, Enosh, Kenan, Mahalaleel, Jared.\" Though her lips moved\r\ndiligently, I am afraid she did not make much of it. As for me, I turned\r\nto the window, and studied the landscape. Father, his custom of a Sunday\r\nafternoon, walked down into the meadow, and the cattle came\r\naffectionately up to him. It was the salt in his broad pocket that they\r\nwere after. \"I might salt them of a Monday,\" he says, \"but they kind of\r\nlook for it, and it isn't kind to disappoint the creetur's on a\r\nSabba'-day. And the merciful man is merciful to his beasts.\"\r\n\r\nThe flies droned and buzzed that summer afternoon. Jerusha nodded over\r\nthe big Bible. Aunt Clara tried to look serious over the book she held.\r\nBut the latent laugh was coursing among the dimples in her face, like a\r\nspark among tinder. I stole up behind, and, leaning over her shoulder,\r\nkissed her.\r\n\r\n\"O, yes,\" said aunty. \"Fine words butter no parsnips, and fine kisses\r\nare no better.\"\r\n\r\nJerusha's head made an awful plunge, then a reactionary lift back, and\r\nthen she opened her eyes and her mouth with such a yawn!\r\n\r\n\"Why, what a mouth!\" I cried. \"Master Minim would rejoice if you would\r\nthus open out in singing-school,\r\n\r\n    'And vie with Gabriel, while he sings.'\"\r\n\r\nOff went Aunt Clara in the laugh again, and this time till the tears\r\ncame. We saw now that there was something in that line which provoked\r\nher mirth; but what Gabriel could have to do with her strange behavior\r\nwe could not imagine, and were wisely silent.\r\n\r\n\"Girls,\" she said, as soon as she could speak for laughing, \"I _will_\r\ntell you.\"\r\n\r\nWe knew she would, provided we were not too anxious to hear. So Jerusha\r\nturned over her leaf to the second chapter of I Chronicles,\r\n\"Reuben, Simeon, Levi.\" I pretended to be more than ever interested out\r\nof doors. Aunt Clara took off her specs, closed her book, smoothed her\r\napron, and began:--\r\n\r\n\"When I was a girl--\"\r\n\r\nNow that we knew the story was coming, we pretended to no more\r\nindifference. Once get aunty started, and, like a horse balky at the\r\njump, she was good for the journey. So Jerusha shut the Bible, and we\r\nboth sat down at her feet.\r\n\r\n\"Not too close, girls. It's dreadful warm.\"\r\n\r\nHer face worked and her sides heaved with her provoking laugh, and we\r\nwere half afraid of a disappointment. But there was no danger. She was\r\nby this time quite as ready to tell as we to hear.\r\n\r\n\"When I was a girl I went to singing-school. Dear me! how many of the\r\nscholars are dead and gone! There was my brother William, poor fellow!\r\nhe died away off in Calcutty. And Sarah Morgan, she never would own to\r\nit that she liked him. But actions speak plainer than words. She never\r\nheld up her head after. And she's dead now, too.\"\r\n\r\nAunt Clara's face--she _is_ a dear old aunty--had now lost every trace\r\nof mirth. The golden sunset touched her fine head, and made her look so\r\nsweetly beautiful that I wondered why no man had had the good taste,\r\nlong ago, to relieve her of her maiden name. Perhaps she will tell us\r\nsome day, and if she does, perhaps we will tell you. She sat two or\r\nthree minutes, thinking and looking, as if she waited to see the loved\r\nand lost. There was a rustle, and she started from her revery. It was\r\nonly mother, flitting into the room with one of her uneasy glances. But\r\nwe were all so still and serious and Sabbath-like, that a look of relief\r\ncame over her countenance. She vanished again, and through the window I\r\nsaw her join her husband in the meadow.\r\n\r\n\"There, now, before they come in,\" said Aunt Clara. \"When I was a girl,\r\nI went to singing-school. Dear me! But we will not think of the dead any\r\nmore. There was one of the girls,--she thought she had a very good\r\nvoice. But she never sings now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" asked Jerusha.\r\n\r\n\"The dear knows. I suppose because she is married. Married people never\r\nsing, I believe. So, girls, if you would keep your voices, you must stay\r\nsingle. Well, there was one of the boys, he thought _he_ had a good\r\nvoice. And he never sings now either.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"O, he's married too. So don't you get cheated into thinking you have\r\nmated a robin. He will turn out a crow, like as any way. I suppose they\r\nboth did have good voices, and, for all that I know, they have still.\r\nThey were the singing-master's especial wonders and his pattern pieces.\r\nHe never was tired of praising them up to the skies, to mortify the rest\r\nof us into good behavior. She was the wonder for the girls' side and he\r\nfor the boys',--two copies that we were to sing up to. I think they were\r\na little proud of the distinction. They were kind of brought together by\r\nit, so that they did not see any harm at all in singing out of the same\r\nnote-book.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose not,\" said Jerusha.\r\n\r\n\"Well, there was one girl in the school,--I dare say she _was_ a\r\ngiggling, mischief-making thing, for everybody said so--\"\r\n\r\n\"Is she living now?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does _she_ sing now?\" asked Jerusha.\r\n\r\n\"Well,--not much.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said I, \"she must be married, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, she is not,\" said Aunt Clara, with a plaintive and very positive\r\nemphasis on the negative particle,--\"no, she is not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why does she not sing?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Nobody will look over the same note-book with her,\" said Jerusha.\r\n\r\n\"O, you girls may have your own fun now,\" said Aunt Clara. \"You will see\r\nthe world with a sadder face by and by.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not if we look at it through your spectacles, aunty,\" I answered.\r\n\r\n\"Dear me; well, the Lord _has_ been kind, to me,\" said Aunt Clara, \"if I\r\nam a spinster still. But we must make haste. The old folks are coming\r\nback.\"\r\n\r\n\"Old folks!\" I thought, and Aunt Clara is older than either of them.\r\nFather stopped and gave an ugly weed a whack with his cane. Then he\r\nstooped and rooted it up, Sabbath-day though it was. I presume he\r\nconsidered it an ox in a pit, for the moment.\r\n\r\nAunt Clara continued:--\"The same tune you were at this afternoon used to\r\nbe a great favorite in our school. It's as old as the hills. I wonder if\r\nIsrael did not let out his voice in it! And Sally, she wouldn't be\r\nbehind _him_, I warrant you.\"\r\n\r\nJerusha and I exchanged glances.\r\n\r\n\"It happened, one evening,--and that's what I was laughing at this\r\nafternoon. You see, the singing-master, if the music was not going to\r\nsuit him, would pull the class straight up in the middle of it, and make\r\nthem begin again. The giggling girl that I was speaking of, she was\r\nalways fuller of her own nonsense than of learning. This particular\r\nevening she was tempted of the Evil One to alter the words to her own\r\npurposes, just for the confusion of those close to her; and a dreadful\r\nmess she would get them into. It was wrong, very wrong indeed,\" Aunt\r\nClara added, with a face that was meant to be serious, while her voice\r\nlaughed, in spite of her.\r\n\r\n\"On this evening, they were singing the very tune, as I told you.\r\nSomething went wrong. The singing-master stopped his viol, and called\r\nout to the class to stop singing. But the heedless girl had got into\r\nmischief, and could not stop with the rest, or she did not hear, or she\r\ndid not wish to. So on she went, all alone, right out, at the top of her\r\nvoice:--\r\n\r\n    'And vie with _Israel_, while he sings,\r\n      In notes almost divine!'\r\n\r\n\"And there she broke down, and sat down, and, graceless hussy as she\r\nwas, laughed as if she was mad. The truth was, that 'vying with Israel'\r\nwas a byword with us. We were always teasing Sally about her vying with\r\nIsrael, as she certainly did, while they sung out of the same book, and\r\nthought a deal more of each other than they did of the music. Everybody\r\ntook the joke, and such a time as there was! Prudence Clark, who turned\r\nround and looked at me in meeting to-day, she laughed the most\r\nspitefully of anybody, for she had a great notion of your fath--I mean\r\nof Israel. As to Israel and Sarah, if ever you did see two persons who\r\ndid not know whether to stand still or to run, to cry or to laugh, they\r\nwere the couple. The master, he tried to read us a solemn lecture; but\r\nhe was so full of suppressed fun that he hugged his viol under his arm\r\ntill one of the strings snapped. That gave the pitch, and we had a\r\nlaughing chorus. All joined in, except Israel and Sarah. She pouted, and\r\nI do believe he grit his teeth.\" Here Aunt Clara gave herself up to the\r\ncomic reminiscence, till her eyes filled again.\r\n\r\n\"Well, and what came of it all?\" asked Jerusha.\r\n\r\n\"Why, it broke up the school for that season, and made town-talk for\r\nnine days. Parson Oliver,--he was a young man then,--he went for to give\r\nthe mischievous girl a good talking to. He needn't have tried that; for\r\nhe was too young to scold a young girl, full of mischief, and, though I\r\nsay it that shouldn't say it, rather pretty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why shouldn't _you_ say she was pretty?\" asked Jerusha.\r\n\r\n\"O, you hush! Well, the girl bent her head down, and a few stray tears\r\ncame, for it _was_ wicked, and she knew it. But before the water got\r\nhead enough to fall from her eyes, she kind of thought that the young\r\nminister's voice was getting shaky, either with mirth or with sadness.\r\nTo find out which, she slyly looked up, and both she and the minister\r\nlaughed long and loud. So there was an end of the jobation that he meant\r\nto give her.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you know all this?\" said Jerusha. \"Were you there?\"\r\n\r\n\"I certainly was not far off.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Israel and Sarah,\" said I, now seeing through the whole affair, and\r\nunderstanding perfectly why father looked aside, and mother sat down,\r\nand Aunt Clara and Prudence Clark of the Dorcas Society exchanged\r\nglances, and the minister himself would have laughed in the pulpit, if\r\nhe had not turned it off with a cough,--\"but Israel and Sarah, how did\r\nthey fare?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Israel, he said that Sarah was just a pretty nobody, and Prudence\r\nClark was a great deal more sensible,--for his part he never cared\r\nanything about Sarah. And Sarah, she declared that Israel was a hawbuck\r\nof a fellow, that no girl would think of when he was out of sight.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was too bad!\" said Jerusha.\r\n\r\n\"_Too_ bad!\" I echoed.\r\n\r\n\"_Dreadful suz_!\" said aunty, mocking our tone. \"Never you fear, if two\r\nyoung simpletons are once caught, that a joke is going to separate them!\r\nAnd whenever you hear two people pretending to hate one another, you may\r\nget your wedding present ready for them. The folks did tease them\r\nthough, too bad, and so they had it, back and forth. Stories never lose\r\nanything by carrying, especially the compliments between two quarrelling\r\nlovers. So it went on for about a month, when Israel, on his way to see\r\nPrudence Clark, who was sitting in her best, waiting for him, stopped to\r\ntell Sarah that he _never_ said so and so. And Sarah said, _she_ never\r\nsaid so and so. And they went into the house to finish their talk, and\r\nPrudence Clark was left lamenting. _I_ know Israel came home very late\r\nthat night.\"\r\n\r\n\"_You_ know?\" said Jerusha.\r\n\r\n\"And father's name is Israel,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"And mother's name is Sarah,\" said my sister.\r\n\r\n\"Hush, hush; here they come,\" said Aunt Clara. \"But I don't believe they\r\nwould ever have found out their own minds if it had not been for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you were the giggling girl,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"She's no better now,\" said my mother, as she entered the room, and\r\nreadily guessed what we had been hearing from aunty. Father walked up to\r\nAunt Clara, and pinched her ears for her. What more he might have done I\r\ndon't know, if Parson Oliver had not dropped in. We made quite a\r\npleasant evening of it, and the old folks discussed the reminiscence in\r\nall its bearings. I like to hear old people talk. They come straight to\r\nthe pith of a subject, especially if it is love and matrimony. And the\r\nmore I hear them, the better I can realize the truth of the Old Virginia\r\nadmonition,--\r\n\r\n    \"Ole folks, ole folks, you better go to bed,\r\n    You only put the mischief in the young folks' head.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAUTUMN SONG.\r\n\r\n\r\n    In Spring the Poet is glad,\r\n      And in Summer the Poet is gay;\r\n    But in Autumn the Poet is sad,\r\n      And has something sad to say:\r\n\r\n    For the wind moans in the wood,\r\n      And the leaf drops from the tree;\r\n    And the cold rain falls on the graves of the good,\r\n      And the cold mist comes up from the sea:\r\n\r\n    And the Autumn songs of the Poet's soul\r\n      Are set to the passionate grief\r\n    Of winds that sough and bells that toll\r\n      The dirge of the falling leaf.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE FALL OF AUSTRIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great characteristic of aristocracies, according to their admirers,\r\nis prudence; and even democrats do not deny the soundness of the claim\r\nthus put forward in their behalf. They are cautious, and if they seldom\r\naccomplish anything brilliant, neither do they put everything to hazard.\r\nIf they gain slowly, they keep long what they have. Did not Venice\r\nendure so long that, when she perished as a nation, within living\r\nmemory, she was the oldest of great communities? And was she not the\r\nmost perfect of all aristocratically governed nations? Was she not the\r\nadmiration of those English republicans of the seventeenth century whose\r\nnames are held in the highest honor wherever freedom is worshipped?\r\nAristocracies have their faults, but they outlast every other kind of\r\ngovernment, and therefore are objects of reverence to all who love\r\norder. The Roman Republic was aristocratical in its polity, and all that\r\nis great in Roman history is due to the ascendency of the Senate in the\r\ngovernment; and when the Forum populace began to show its power, the\r\ndecay of the commonwealth commenced, and did not cease till despotism\r\nwas established,--the natural effect of the resistance of the many to\r\nthe government of the few being the formation of the government of one.\r\nEngland's polity is, and for ages has been, aristocratical. Not even the\r\npassage of the Reform Bill materially lessened the power of the\r\naristocracy; and the declaration of Earl Grey, the father of the\r\nmeasure, that it would be found the most aristocratical of measures,--as\r\nhe was one of the most aristocratical of men,--does not seem so absurd\r\nnow as it appeared four-and-thirty years since, when we note how\r\ndifficult it now is to lower the franchise in Britain. The firmest\r\ngovernment in Europe is that of England, in which property has greater\r\ninfluence than in that of any other nation. The conclusion drawn by\r\naristocrats and their admirers is, that aristocracies are the most\r\nenduring of all the polities known to men, and that they are so because\r\naristocrats are the most prudent and cautious of men. The governments\r\nthey form and control wash and wear well, and bid defiance to what Bacon\r\ncalls \"the waves and weathers of time.\"\r\n\r\nThere is some truth in this. Aristocracies _are_ cautious and prudent,\r\nand indisposed to risk present advantage in the hope of future gain.\r\nTherefore aristocratical polities often attain to great age, and the\r\nnations that know them attain slowly to great and firmly-placed power.\r\nRome and Venice and England are striking examples of these truths. Yet\r\nit is not the less true that aristocracies sometimes do behave with a\r\nrashness that cannot be paralleled from the histories of democracies and\r\ndespotisms. It has been the fortune of this age to see two examples of\r\nthis rashness, such as no other age ever witnessed or ever could have\r\nwitnessed. The first of these was presented in the action, in 1860-61,\r\nof the American aristocracy. The second was that of the Austrian\r\naristocracy, in 1866. The American aristocracy--the late slavocracy--was\r\nthe most powerful body in the world; so powerful, that it was safe\r\nagainst everything but itself. It had been gradually built up, until it\r\nwas as towering as its foundations were deep and broad. Not only was it\r\nunassailed, but there was no disposition in any influential quarter to\r\nassail it. The few persons who did attack it, from a distance, produced\r\nscarcely more effect adverse to its ascendency, than was produced by the\r\nlabors of the first Christians against the Capitoline Jupiter in the\r\ndays of the Julian Cæsars. Abolitionists were annoyed and insulted even\r\nin the course of that political campaign which ended in the election of\r\nMr. Lincoln to the Presidency; and not a few of the victors in that\r\ncampaign were forward to declare, that between their party and the\r\n\"friends of the slave\" there was neither friendship nor sympathy. One of\r\nthe most eminent of the Republicans of Massachusetts declared that he\r\nfelt hurt at the thought that his party could be suspected of approving\r\nthe conduct of Captain John Brown at Harper's Ferry. Down to the\r\nspring-time of 1860, it required, on the part of the American\r\nslaveholding interest, only a moderate display of that prudence which is\r\nsaid to be the chief virtue of an aristocracy, to secure all they\r\npossessed,--which was all the country had to give,--and to prepare the\r\nway for such gains as it might be found necessary to make, as the\r\nAmerican nation should increase in strength. But this prudence the\r\nslaveholders would not display. They annoyed and insulted the people of\r\nthe Free States. They broke up the Democratic party, which was well\r\ndisposed to do their work. They pursued such a course as compelled the\r\ngreat majority of the American people to take up arms against them, and\r\nto abolish slavery by an act of war. The effect was the fall of a body\r\nof men who certainly were very powerful, and who were believed to be\r\nvery wise in their generation. It was impossible to attack them as long\r\nas they were true to their own interests, and they could fall only\r\nthrough being attacked. They made war on the nation, and the nation was\r\nforced to defend herself, and destroyed them. It is the most wonderful\r\ncase of suicide known to mankind.\r\n\r\nThe Austrian aristocracy behaved almost as unwisely as the American\r\naristocracy. As the Republic of the United States is a union of States,\r\nwhich in reality was governed by the slaveholders down to 1861, so is\r\nthe Austrian Empire a collection of countries, governed by a few great\r\nfamilies, at the head of which stand the imperial family,--the House of\r\nAustria, or, as it is now generally called, the House of\r\nHapsburg-Lorraine. That aristocracy might have prevented the occurrence\r\nof war last summer, by ceding Venetia to Italy; and that it did not make\r\nsuch cession early in June, when we know it was ready to make it early\r\nin July, but plunged into a contest which, according to the apologists\r\nfor its terrible defeat, it was wholly unprepared to wage, speaks but\r\npoorly for its prudence, though that is claimed to be _the_ virtue of\r\naristocracies. The Austrian aristocrats behaved as senselessly in 1866\r\nas the Prussian aristocrats in 1806, but with less excuse than the\r\nlatter had. By their action they caused their country's degradation.\r\nFrom the rank of a first-rate power that country has been compelled to\r\ndescend, not so much through loss of territory and population as through\r\nloss of position. For centuries the house of Austria has been very\r\npowerful in Europe, though the Austrian empire can count but sixty\r\nyears. Rudolph of Hapsburg, the first member of his line who rose to\r\ngreat eminence, in the latter part of the thirteenth century, founded\r\nthe house of Austria. While holding the imperial throne, he obtained for\r\nhis own family Austria, Styria, Carinthia, and Carniola; but it was not\r\ntill several generations after his death, and in the fifteenth century,\r\nthat the imperial dignity became virtually, though not in terms,\r\nhereditary in the Hapsburg line. For several centuries, down to the\r\nextinction of the office, there was no Emperor of Germany who was not of\r\nthat family. Every effort to divert the office from that house ended in\r\nfailure. The consequence was, that the house of Austria became the first\r\nof reigning families; and at one time it seemed about to grasp the\r\nsceptre of the world. When the Empire ceased to exist, the Austrian\r\nempire, though of later creation than the French empire of Napoleon I.,\r\nhad that appearance of antique grandeur which has so great an effect on\r\nmen's minds. It was looked upon as ancient because the imperial family\r\nreally was ancient, and could trace itself back through almost twelve\r\nhundred years, to the sixth century, though in places the tracing was of\r\nthe most shadowy character. It profited from the greatness of the\r\nHapsburgs in the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries,--a\r\ngreatness which is among the most extraordinary things recorded in\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nShould the history of royal marriages ever be written in a manner\r\nproportioned to its importance, a large part of the work would have to\r\nbe given to the marriages made by various princes of the house of\r\nAustria; for those marriages had prodigious effect on the condition of\r\nthe best portions of the human race, and in the sixteenth century it\r\nseemed that they were about to bring, not only most of Europe, but\r\nnearly all America, a large part of Asia, and not a little of Africa\r\nunder the rule of one family, and that family by no means superior to\r\nthat of Valois or the Plantagenets. The extraordinary luck of the house\r\nof Austria in turning marriage into a source of profit was early\r\nremarked; and in the latter part of the fifteenth century, long before\r\nthe best of the Austrian matrimonial alliances were made, Matthias\r\nCorvinus, the greatest of Hungarian kings, wrote a Latin epigram on the\r\nsubject, which was even more remarkable as a prediction than as a\r\nstatement of fact; for it was as applicable to the marriage of Napoleon\r\nI. and Maria Louisa, and to that of Philip the Fair and Juana the\r\nFoolish, as it was to that of Maximilian and Mary.[25] It is from the\r\nStyrian line of the Austrian house that all princes of that house who\r\nhave reigned for four centuries and upward are descended. Ernest, third\r\nson of that Leopold who was defeated and slain at the battle of Sempach\r\nby the Swiss, became master of the duchies of Styria, Carniola, and\r\nCarinthia. He was a pious prince, and made a pilgrimage to Palestine,\r\nafter the superstitious fashion of his time. He was a quarrelsome\r\nprince, and kept himself in a state of perpetual hot water with his\r\nbrother. He was an amorous and a chivalrous prince, and, having lost his\r\nfirst wife, he got him a second after a knightly fashion. Having heard\r\nmuch of the material and mental charms of the Princess Cymburga, a\r\nPolish lady who had the blood of the Yagellons in her veins, he went to\r\nCracow in disguise, found that report had not exaggerated her merits,\r\nand, prudently making himself known, proposed for her hand, and got it.\r\nBut Cymburga was not only very clever and very beautiful: she was a\r\nmuscular Christian in crinoline,--for hoops were known in those days\r\namong the Poles, or might have been known to them,--and if they were, no\r\ndoubt Cymburga, like American ladies of to-day, had the sense and taste\r\nto use them. She had such strength of fist that, when she had occasion\r\nto drive a nail into anything, she dispensed with a hammer; and she\r\neconomized in nut-crackers, as some independent people do in the item of\r\npocket-handkerchiefs, by using her fingers. One would think that Ernest\r\nwould have hesitated to woo and wed a lady who was so capable of\r\ncarrying matters with a high hand; but then he was a very strong man,\r\nand was surnamed \"The Iron,\" so that he could venture where no other man\r\nwould have thought of going. This strong-handed as well as strong-minded\r\ncouple, who were both paired and matched, must be taken as the real\r\nfounders of that house of Austria which has been so conspicuous in the\r\nhistory of Christendom for almost four centuries, though they and their\r\ndescendants built on the broad and solid foundations established by\r\nRudolph of Hapsburg and his earlier descendants. Some authorities say\r\nthat Cymburga brought into the Hapsburg family that thick lip--\"the\r\nAustrian lip\"--so often mentioned in history; but others call it the\r\nBurgundian lip, though the marriage between Maximilian (Cymburga's\r\ngrandson) and Mary of Burgundy (Charles the Bold's daughter) did not\r\ntake place till 1477; and the ducal Burgundian family was only a branch\r\nof the French royal line of Valois. It was no addition to the beauty of\r\nthe imperial family, no matter to whom that family was indebted for it.\r\nIt is certain that it appeared in the Emperor Frederick III., son of\r\nErnest and Cymburga, and father of that Emperor who, when an archduke,\r\nmarried the Burgundian duchess, if such Mary can be called; for Menzel,\r\nwho must have seen portraits of him, and who knew his history well,\r\nspeaks of him as \"a slow, grave man, with a large, protruding\r\nunder-lip.\"\r\n\r\nThis Frederick was a singular character. He had the longest\r\nreign--fifty-three years--of all the German Emperors, and it may be said\r\nthat he founded the house of Hapsburg, considering it as an imperial\r\nline. Yet he is almost invariably spoken of contemptuously. Menzel says\r\nthat no Emperor had reigned so long and done so little. Mr. Bryce\r\ndeclares that under him the Empire sank to its lowest point. Even\r\nArchdeacon Coxe, who held his memory in respect, and did his best to\r\nmake out a good character for him, has to admit \"that he was a prince of\r\na languid and inactive character,\" and to make other damaging admissions\r\nthat detract from the excellence of the elaborate portrait he has drawn\r\nof him. There was something fantastical in his favorite\r\npursuits,--astrology, alchemy, antiquities, alphabet-making, and the\r\nlike,--which the men of an iron age viewed with a contempt that probably\r\nhad much to do with giving him that character which he has in history,\r\ncontemporary opinion of a ruler generally being accepted, and enduring.\r\n\"A species of anagram,\" says the English historian of his family,\r\n\"consisting of the five vowels, he adopted as indicative of the future\r\ngreatness of the house of Austria, imprinted it on all his books, carved\r\nit on all his buildings, and engraved it on all his plate. This riddle\r\noccupied the grave heads of his learned contemporaries, and gave rise to\r\nmany ridiculous conjectures, till the _important_ secret was disclosed\r\nafter his death by an interpretation written in his own hand, in which\r\nthe vowels form the initials of a sentence in Latin and German,\r\nsignifying, 'The house of Austria is to govern the whole world.'\"[26]\r\nNotwithstanding the archidiaconal sneer, Frederick III.'s anagram came\r\nquite as near the truth as any uninspired prophecy that can be\r\nmentioned. In little more than sixty years after the Emperor's death,\r\nthe house of Austria ruled over Germany, the Netherlands, Naples,\r\nSicily, the Milanese, Hungary, Bohemia, the Spains, England and Ireland\r\n(in virtue of Philip II.'s marriage with Mary I., queen-regnant of\r\nEngland), the greater part of America, from the extreme north to the\r\nextreme south, portions of Northern Africa, the Philippines, and some\r\nminor possessions; and it really ruled, though indirectly, most of that\r\npart of Italy, outside of the territory of Venice, that had nominally an\r\nindependent existence. Before Holland's independence was fully\r\nestablished, but after the connection with England had ceased, Portugal\r\npassed under the dominion of the Spanish branch of the house of Austria,\r\nwith all her immense American, African, and Asiatic colonial\r\npossessions. For years, Philip II. was more powerful in France than any\r\none of her sovereigns could pretend to be. Frederick's prediction,\r\ntherefore, came to pass almost literally, and was less an exaggeration\r\nthan St. Luke's assertion that a decree went forth from Cæsar Augustus\r\nthat all the world should be taxed. As Augustus was lord of nearly all\r\nthe world that a man like St. Luke could consider civilized and worth\r\ngoverning, so might an Austrian writer of the sixteenth century declare\r\nthat the Hapsburgs ruled over wellnigh all the world that could be\r\nlooked upon as belonging to the Christian commonwealth, including not a\r\nlittle that had been stolen from the heathen by Christians.\r\n\r\nIt was by marriage that the Hapsburgs became so great in so short a\r\ntime. Frederick III. married Eleanor, a Portuguese princess, whose\r\nmother was of the royal house of Castille. Portugal is not even of\r\nsecond rank now, and the Braganças are not in the first rank of royal\r\nfamilies. But in the fifteenth century Portugal stood relatively and\r\npositively very high, and the house of Avis was above the house of\r\nAustria, though a king of Portugal was necessarily inferior to the head\r\nof the Holy Roman Empire. This marriage did not advance the fortunes of\r\nthe Austrian family, though it connected them with three other great\r\nfamilies,--the reigning houses of Portugal, Castille, and England, the\r\nPrincess Eleanor having Plantagenet blood. But the son of Frederick and\r\nEleanor, afterward the Emperor Maximilian I.,[27] married Mary of\r\nBurgundy in 1477, which \"gave a lift\" to his race that enabled it to\r\nincrease in importance at a very rapid rate. Mary was in possession of\r\nmost of the immense dominions of her father, which he had intended to\r\nconvert into a kingdom, had he lived to complete his purpose. His\r\nsuccess would have had great effect on the after history of Europe, for\r\nhe would have reigned over the finest of countries, and his dominions\r\nwould have extended from the North Sea to Provence,--and over Provence\r\nso powerful a sovereign would have had no difficulty in extending his\r\npower,--which done, his dominions would have been touched by the\r\nMediterranean. Louis XI. of France got hold of some of Mary's\r\ninheritance; but the greater part thereof she conveyed to Maximilian.\r\nShe died young, leaving a son and a daughter. The son was Philip the\r\nFair, who in 1496 married Juana, daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella,\r\nking of Aragon, and queen of Castille, and heiress of the Spanish\r\nmonarchy, which had come to great glory through the conquest of Granada,\r\nand to wonderful influence through the discovery of the New\r\nWorld,--events that took place in the same year, and but a short time\r\nbefore the marriage of the Austrian archduke and the Peninsular\r\nprincess. This marriage, useful and brilliant as it was to the house of\r\nAustria, turned out bitterly bad to the parties to it,--and it is not an\r\nisolated case in that respect. Philip the Fair was a very handsome\r\nfellow, as became his designation, or rather whence his designation\r\ncame; but on the principle that \"handsome is that handsome does,\" he was\r\none of the ugliest of men. He was guilty of gallantry, the weakness of\r\nkings, and of many of the sovereign people too. When living in Spain he\r\nhad many amorous adventures; and his wife, who had brought him so great\r\na fortune that she thought she had an especial claim on his fidelity,\r\nbecame exceedingly jealous, and, being a _dague en jarretière_ lady, as\r\nbecame one who was born to reign over Andaluçia, killed her faithless\r\nhusband,--not by stabbing him, but by giving him poison. This was in\r\n1506, when husband and wife were but twenty-eight and twenty-four years\r\nold, and had been but ten years married. There were two sons and four\r\ndaughters born of this marriage, all of whom made important marriages.\r\nThe eldest son was the man whom Mr. Stirling calls \"the greatest monarch\r\nof the memorable sixteenth century,\"--Charles V., Emperor of Germany,\r\nand the Spanish Charles I. He founded the Spanish branch of the house of\r\nAustria, the elder branch.[28] He married Isabella of Portugal, and\r\ntheir son was Philip II., who added Portugal to the possessions of the\r\nAustrian family, and one of whose wives was Mary Tudor, queen of\r\nEngland, the Bloody Mary of fire-and-fagot memory; and Philip gladly\r\nwould have placed Mary's sister Elizabeth in his half-vacant bed. The\r\nmarriage of Philip and Mary was barren, and poor Mary's belief that a\r\n\"blessed baby\" was coming has been matter for laughter for more than\r\nthree hundred years. Had her agonizing prayers for offspring been heard,\r\nwhat a change would have been wrought in human destinies, even had the\r\nchild lived to be no older than Edward VI.! The second son of Philip the\r\nFair and Juana was Ferdinand, named from his maternal grandfather,\r\nFerdinand the Catholic, king of Argon. He was the founder of the German\r\nbranch of the house of Austria, the younger branch, which has long\r\nsurvived the elder branch, though now it exists only in the female line,\r\nand really is the house of Lorraine. Ferdinand became Ferdinand I.,\r\nEmperor of Germany, and he did far more than was done by his elder\r\nbrother to keep up the character of his family for making much through\r\nmarriage. In 1522, when but nineteen, he married Anne Yagellon, princess\r\nof Hungary and Bohemia,--a marriage that might not have proved very\r\nimportant, but that death came in and made it so, and also the births\r\nthat came from it, as will presently appear. Charles and Ferdinand had\r\nfour sisters, and they all four made great marriages, three of which\r\nwere very useful to the Austrian house. The eldest of these ladies,\r\nEleanora, was married to Emanuel, king of Portugal,--a man old enough to\r\nbe her father, with some years to spare,--being sacrificed to the\r\nambition of her brother Charles, for she was attached to the Count\r\nPalatine. Becoming a widow, she was compelled to give her hand to that\r\npopular rascal, Francis I. of France, when her brother wished to\r\nstrengthen the treaty he made with his \"good brother\" at Madrid, and\r\nwhich the Frenchman had arranged to disregard even before he signed it.\r\nThe second sister, Isabella, married Christian II., king of Denmark,\r\nwhen she was but fourteen, and died at twenty-four. Mary, the third\r\nsister, became the wife of Louis II., king of Hungary and Bohemia, and\r\nlast of the Yagellons. The fourth sister, Catherine, married John III.,\r\nking of Portugal. It was the marriage of the third sister, Mary, that,\r\nin connection with his own marriage, had the greatest effect on the\r\nfortunes of her brother Ferdinand, as his wife was the sister of Louis\r\nII., Mary's husband. Louis was defeated by the Turks at the battle of\r\nMohacz, in 1526, and lost his life while flying from the field.\r\nFerdinand claimed the crowns of Bohemia and Hungary, as Louis left no\r\nchildren, and he was chosen king in both countries; and though he\r\ndisowned all other rights to the Bohemian throne than that of the\r\nelection, it is certain he never would have been elected by either\r\nnation had he not married the sister of Louis, and had not Louis married\r\nhis sister. All these marriages, and other events that carried the power\r\nof the house of Austria to the greatest height, took place only\r\nthirty-three years after the death of Frederick III., and some of his\r\ncontemporaries may have lived to witness them all.\r\n\r\nThe marriages of the house of Austria since the sixteenth century have\r\nnot been so important as they were in that century, but they have not\r\nbeen without influence on events, in exceptional cases. The marriage of\r\nMarie Antoinette and the French prince who became Louis XVI. was\r\nfruitful of results; and the marriage of Napoleon I. and Marie Louise,\r\nby causing the French emperor to rely on Austrian aid in 1813, had\r\nmemorable consequences. Louis XIII. and Louis XIV. married Austrian\r\nprincesses of the Spanish branch; and the marriage of Louis XIV. and\r\nMaria Theresa led to the founding of that Bourbon line which reigns over\r\nSpain, though the main line has ceased to reign in France. The greatness\r\nof the house of Austria in the seventeenth century is visible only in\r\nGermany, after the death of Philip IV. of Spain. The German Hapsburgs\r\nhad a powerful influence in the seventeenth century, playing then great\r\nparts, but often finding themselves in danger of extinction before their\r\nSpanish cousins had run out.[29] They were the rivals of the French\r\nkings of that century, and Louis XIV. was talked of as a candidate for\r\nthe imperial throne. The course of English politics had a very favorable\r\neffect on the fortunes of the Hapsburgs, the same conduct that gave\r\nsupremacy to Protestantism and constitutionalism in Great Britain\r\nworking most favorably in behalf of that family which, for ten\r\ngenerations, has been identified with everything that is bigoted and\r\nintolerant in religion and politics. James II., after his fall, implored\r\nassistance from the Emperor of Germany, Leopold I.; and, considering\r\nthat both were intensely Catholic, his application ought to have been\r\nfavorably received; but the reigning Emperor had little difficulty in\r\nshowing that it was not in his power, as assuredly it was not for his\r\ninterest, to help the exiled king,--who was an exile only because of his\r\nattachment to that ancient Church through which alone, as Leopold\r\nbelieved, salvation could be secured. He went with the heretical William\r\nIII. England, indeed, has been the bulwark of the German Hapsburgs on\r\nmany occasions, and has saved them on more than one occasion from\r\noverthrow; and she did her best to aid even the Spanish branch in its\r\nlast years, and then exerted herself to secure that branch's possessions\r\nfor its relations at Vienna. It was English military genius that saved\r\nthe Emperor Leopold I. from destruction.[30] When most of Continental\r\nEurope showed itself hostile to the Austrian house after the death of\r\nCharles VI., England was the fast friend of Maria Theresa, his daughter,\r\nand aided her to get over difficulties that seemed about to overwhelm\r\nher; and it was the fault rather of Austria than of England that the two\r\ncountries did not act together in the Seven Years' War, when England\r\nwas, as it were, forced into the Prussian alliance, and helped Frederick\r\nwin his astonishing victories. Austria came out of that memorable\r\ncontest without having accomplished the purpose for which she entered\r\nit; but she had displayed great power during its course, and in the last\r\nhalf of the reign of the empress-queen, her reputation stood very high.\r\nJoseph II., though he declared that he had failed in everything,\r\nimpressed himself very powerfully on the European mind, and was counted\r\na great sovereign. No common man could have entertained the projects\r\nthat crowded his teeming mind, and which came to little in most\r\ninstances because they were in advance of the time.\r\n\r\nDuring the tremendous struggle that proceeded from the French\r\nRevolution, Austria was almost always in the foreground, and next to\r\nEngland showed greatest powers of endurance in combating the new order\r\nof things. Six times she made war on France, and though in four of these\r\nwars she was beaten, she had the fortune to decide the event of the\r\nfifth,--that of 1814-15; and in 1815 she was as active against Napoleon\r\nas circumstances permitted any of the Allies to be, except England and\r\nPrussia. The effect of this pertinacity, and of her decisive part in\r\n1813, was to secure for her a degree of consideration altogether\r\ndisproportioned to her real power. Men took her for what she appeared to\r\nbe, not as she was. In truth, very little was known of her condition,\r\nand the few who were aware of her weakness were interested in keeping\r\ntheir knowledge to themselves. The grand effort which she made in 1809,\r\nsingle-handed almost, to break the power of Napoleon, was everywhere\r\nlooked upon as something alike herculean and heroical, and as such it is\r\nspoken of in all those historical works from which most readers obtain\r\nknowledge of the early years of this century; but now we know from other\r\nsources, and particularly from the Diary of Gentz, that she never was in\r\na worse state than she knew in the days of Eckmühl, Essling, and Wagram.\r\nReading what Gentz wrote in the ten weeks that followed Wagram, we feel\r\nas if we were reading of the twenty days that followed Sadowa. But of\r\nthis nobody outside of the empire seems to have known or suspected\r\nanything; and the number of persons in the empire who knew it, or\r\nsuspected it, was not large. Even Napoleon, who was on the ground, and\r\nwho had the country more at his control than it was at that of Francis\r\nII., seems to have been entirely ignorant of the true state of affairs.\r\nHe could have \"crumpled up\" Austria with ease, and have made half a\r\ndozen kingdoms or grand duchies of the spoils he had seized,--and yet he\r\ntalked to General Bubna, and to others of the Austrian negotiators, as\r\nif he considered Austria the greatest nation in Europe, and sure swiftly\r\nto recover from the consequences of the blows he had dealt her. He\r\nactually spoke of the ability she would secure to decide the future fate\r\nof Europe, and therein was a prophet of his own ruin. It is possible\r\nthat there may have been some affectation in what he said, but there was\r\nas much sincerity, for there is a great deal in the history of his\r\ncareer that shows he had a high opinion of Austrian power. When Europe\r\nwas settled, after his fall, Austria acquired the right to stand between\r\nEngland and Russia, as their equal; and down to 1848 she was the\r\nsuperior of both France and Prussia. The events of 1848-49 did not\r\nessentially lessen her prestige, and she had a commanding place during\r\nthe Russian war. Even her defeats in the Italian war did not lead to any\r\nserious loss of consideration, and against them was set the striking\r\nfact that the victorious French had halted before the Quadrilateral, and\r\nactually had begged for peace from the vanquished.\r\n\r\nWe know how deceptive were all appearances in regard to Austrian\r\nstrength; but it was in the power of Austrian statesmen to convert what\r\nwas simply apparent into a solid reality. Had they been wise men, they\r\nwould, during the long peace that followed 1815, have made of Austria a\r\nstate as powerful in fact as the world believed her to be. Nothing could\r\nhave been easier, as her undeveloped resources ever have been vast; but\r\nthey did nothing of the kind, their sole aim being to get over the\r\npresent, without any regard for the future. Hermayr says of Thugut, who\r\nwas chief Austrian minister in the closing years of the last century,\r\nthat \"his policy knew neither virtue nor vice, only expedients\"; and\r\nthese words describe the policy of Metternich completely, and, with\r\nperhaps a little modification, they describe that of all his successors.\r\nSo that when the Prussian war came, Austria was in the same state that\r\nshe was in 1809,--seemingly very strong, actually very weak; and she\r\nfell in a month, with a great ruin, much to the astonishment of almost\r\nall men. But the difference between 1809 and 1866 is this,--that the\r\nlight let into Austria through chinks made by the Prussian bayonet will\r\nprevent the game of deception from being renewed.\r\n\r\nIt is assumed by most persons, that the house of Austria has at last\r\nreached the turn of its fortunes, and that, having been beaten down by\r\nPrussia, it never will be able to rise again. This is the reaction\r\nagainst the sentiment that prevailed so generally at the beginning of\r\nlast summer, just before the first blood was drawn in that war which\r\nproved so disastrous to Austria. In America, as in England, not only was\r\nit assumed that the Austrians had the better cause, but that the better\r\nchances of success were clearly with them. Black and yellow would\r\ndistance black and white, and the two-headed eagle would tear and rend\r\nthe single-headed eagle, thus affording another proof that two heads are\r\nbetter than one. Now, all is changed. In England, opinion is setting\r\nalmost as strongly Prussiaward as it did in 1815, though the Prussians\r\nand the Prussian government have made no apologies for those ungracious\r\nacts against Englishmen which it was the fashion to cite as evidence of\r\nthe dislike borne to the islanders by the countrymen of Bismarck.\r\nCaptain Heehaw, of the Coldstreams, who thought--really, 'pon\r\nhonor--that the Prussians would not be able to look half their number of\r\nAustrians in the face, has wheeled about, converted by the fast flashes\r\nof the needle-gun; and the gallant Captain, who would fight like an\r\nAchilles should opportunity offer, is a fair type of his fellows. There\r\nis a complete change of front. The English are countermarching, and will\r\ntake up their former ground,--if they have not already taken it,--that\r\non which they stood when their Parliament thanked Blücher and his\r\nPrussians for helping Wellington and his Britons strike down Napoleon\r\nand the French. Prussia now means a united Germany, to be ruled by the\r\nhouse of Hohenzollern, whose head is an old king of threescore and ten\r\nyears, and who must, in the regular course of things, soon be displaced\r\nby a bold young prince, whose brows are thickly covered with laurels\r\ngathered on the field of Sadowa, and whose wife is the eldest child of\r\nQueen Victoria. Why should not Protestant England rejoice with\r\nProtestant Prussia, and see her successes with gladness? Sure enough;\r\nand English joy over the prodigious Prussian triumph of last summer\r\nought to be the most natural thing in the world. But we cannot forget\r\nwhat was the color of English opinion down to the time when it was\r\ndemonstrated by the logic of cannon that the Prussian cause was\r\nperfectly pure, and that it was to fly in the face of Providence to\r\nquestion its excellence. If ever a man was hated in England, Count\r\nBismarck had the honor of being thus hated. And it was an honor; for\r\nnext to the love of a great people, their hatred is the best evidence of\r\na man's greatness. Napoleon in 1807 was not more detested by Englishmen\r\nthan Bismarck in 1866. The obnoxious Prussian statesman was not even\r\nrespected, for he had done nothing to command the respect of enemies.\r\nFrom the tone in which he was talked of, it was plain that the English\r\nconsidered him to be a mischievous, malicious, elfish sort of creature,\r\nwho could not do anything that would deserve to be considered great, but\r\nwho did his utmost to make himself and his country the nuisances of\r\nEurope. Books have been made from English journals to show how\r\nextraordinarily they berated this country during the Secession war,\r\nbecause Americans were so brutally perverse and so selfishly silly as\r\nnot to submit their country's throat to the Southern sabre for the\r\nbenefit of Britain, which condescends to think that our national\r\nexistence is something not altogether compatible with her safety. But a\r\ncollection made from the same journals of articles assailing Prussia in\r\ngeneral, and Count Bismarck in particular, would be even richer than\r\nanything that has been collected to show English sympathy with gentlemen\r\nwho were fighting valiantly to establish that \"better kind of\r\ncivilization\" which is based on slavery. All is now changed toward\r\nPrussia, as most has been changed toward us for twenty months, ever\r\nsince the fall of Richmond. If Prussia should not soon establish a\r\n\"cordial understanding\" with England, _vice_ France discarded, it will\r\nbe because she is not disposed to an English alliance, or because her\r\nfortunes shall have undergone a change, and rendered her unworthy of\r\nbeing courted. That ancient connection of England and Austria, dating\r\nfrom the time that the Bourbons became dangerous to Europe, and which\r\nwas so often alluded to in the time of the Italian war, and in the days\r\nthat immediately preceded the German conflict, is thought little of by\r\nEnglishmen, who prefer to think of Pitt's connection with Frederick when\r\nthe latter was threatened with annihilation by Austria. Prussia has not\r\nonly beaten the Austrian armies; she has conquered English\r\nprejudices,--much the more difficult task of the two.\r\n\r\nThe Austrians must be amused by the change that has come over the\r\nEnglish mind; but with their sense of the satire which that change may\r\nbe said to embody, there is possibly mingled the reflection that their\r\ncase, bad as it is, is not so bad as to deprive them of hope. Looking\r\nback over the history of the house of Austria, there is much in it to\r\nallow the belief that possibly it may again rise to the highest place in\r\nEurope. That house has often fallen quite as low as we have seen it\r\nfall, and yet it has not passed away, but has renewed its life and\r\nstrength, and has taken high part in effecting the punishment, and even\r\nthe destruction, of those who might have destroyed it. When Matthias\r\nCorvinus held Vienna,--when that city was besieged by the great Solyman,\r\nwhose troops marched as far to the west as Ratisbon,--when Charles V.\r\nfled before Maurice of Saxony, \"lest he might one fine morning be seized\r\nin his bed,\"--when Andrew Thonradtel took Ferdinand II. by the buttons\r\nof his doublet, and said, \"Nandel, give in, thou must sign\" (a paper\r\ncontaining the articles of the union of the Austrian Estates with the\r\nBohemians, which Ferdinand refused to sign, and never signed),--when\r\nGustavus Adolphus was beating or baffling all the Imperial\r\ngenerals,--when Wallenstein was directing his army of _condottieri_,\r\nwith which he had saved the Austrian house, against that house,--when\r\nKara Mustapha, at the head of two hundred thousand Turks, aided by the\r\nHungarians, and encouraged by the French, laid siege to Vienna, and sent\r\nhis light cavalry to the banks of the Inn, and came wellnigh succeeding\r\nin his undertaking, and would have done so but for the coming in of John\r\nSobieski and his Poles,--when the French and Bavarians, in 1704, had\r\nbrought the Empire to the brink of destruction, so that it could be\r\nsaved only through the combined exertions of such men as Eugène and\r\nMarlborough,--when almost all Continental Europe that was possessed of\r\npower directed that power against the Imperial house immediately after\r\nthe death of Charles VI., last male member of the line of\r\nHapsburg,--when Napoleon I. destroyed an Austrian army at Ulm, and took\r\nVienna, and beat to pieces the Austro-Russian army at Austerlitz,--when\r\nthe same Emperor took Vienna the second time, in 1809, after a series of\r\nbrilliant victories, wonderful even in his most wonderful history, and\r\nwon the victory of Wagram, and allowed the Austrian monarchy to exist\r\nonly because he thought of marrying a daughter of its head,--when\r\nHungarians, Italians, Germans, and others of its subjects were in arms\r\nagainst it, in 1848-49,--when Montebello and Palestro were followed by\r\nMagenta and Solferino,--the condition of the house of Austria was nearly\r\nas low as it is to-day, and on some of these occasions probably it was\r\neven more reduced than it is at present. Men were ready in 1529, in\r\n1552, in 1619, in 1632, in 1683, in 1704, in 1741, in 1805, in 1809, in\r\n1849, and in 1859 to say, as now they say, that the last hour of the\r\nfortunate dynasty was about to strike on the clock of Time, forgetting\r\nall its earlier escapes from the last consequences of defeat,\r\nrecollection of which would have enabled them to form better judgments.\r\nOn a dozen occasions Austria has risen superior to the effects of the\r\ndirest misfortunes, and she may do so again. And her triumphs,\r\nproceeding out of failures, have not been won over common men or in\r\nordinary contests. She has rarely had to deal with mean antagonists, and\r\nher singular victories have been enhanced in value by the high grade of\r\nher enemies. Francis I., Sultan Solyman, Gustavus Adolphus, Wallenstein,\r\nRichelieu, Louis XIV., Napoleon I., and Kossuth are conspicuous in the\r\nlist of her enemies. They were all great men,--deriving greatness some\r\nof them from their intellectual powers, others from their positions as\r\nsovereigns, and yet others from both their positions and their powers of\r\nmind. Yet she got the better of them all,[31] and some of them fell\r\nmiserably because of her enmity to them,--as Wallenstein and Napoleon.\r\nFrederick the Great was in some sense an exception, as he accomplished\r\nmost of his purposes at her expense; and yet it cannot with propriety be\r\nsaid that he conquered her, or that, at the utmost, he was ever more\r\nthan the equal of Maria Theresa or Joseph II., with all his undoubted\r\nintellectual superiority. When we compare the Austria of 1813 with the\r\nAustria of 1809, and see how wonderfully fortune had worked in her favor\r\nunder circumstances far from promising anything for her benefit, we are\r\nnot surprised that Austrians should still be full of confidence, or that\r\na few other men should share what seems to be in them a well-founded\r\nhope. A belief in good luck sometimes helps men to the enjoyment of good\r\nluck,--and if men, why not nations?\r\n\r\nYet against this reliance on her luck by Austria must be placed the\r\nwonderful changes that have come over the world since those times when\r\nit was in the power of a government like the Austrian to exert a great\r\ninfluence on the course of events. Down to the time of the French\r\nRevolution, Austrian contests were carried on against nations,\r\ngovernments, and dynasties, and not against peoples. Even the wars that\r\ngrew out of the Reformation were in no strict sense of a popular\r\ncharacter, but were waged by the great of the earth, who found their\r\naccount in being champions of progressive ideas,--the liberalism of\r\nthose days. Almost all the renowned anti-Austrian leaders of the Thirty\r\nYears' War were kings, nobles, aristocrats of every grade, most of whom,\r\nwe may suppose, cared as little for political freedom as the Hapsburgs\r\ncared for it. Gustavus Adolphus could be as arbitrary as Ferdinand II.,\r\nand some of his most ardent admirers are of opinion that he fell none\r\ntoo soon for his own reputation, though much too soon for the good of\r\nEurope, when he was slain on the glorious field of Lützen. The most\r\nremarkable of all the wars waged by the Austrian house against human\r\nrights was that which Philip II. and his successor directed against the\r\nDutch: the latter were the champions of liberty; but the opponents of\r\nthe Spanish Hapsburgs even in that war can hardly be called the people.\r\nThey were--at least the animating and inspiriting portion of them--the\r\nold Dutch municipal aristocracy, who on most occasions were well\r\nsupported by the people. Down to a time within living memory, the German\r\nHapsburgs contended only against their equals in blood and birth, if not\r\nalways in power. In 1792 a new age began. The armies of Revolutionary\r\nFrance were even more democratic than our own in the Secession war, and\r\nnot even Napoleon's imperializing and demoralizing course could entirely\r\nchange their character. Democracy and aristocracy, each all armed, were\r\nfairly pitted against each other, in that long list of actions which\r\nbegan at Jemappes and terminated at Solferino. The Austrian army, like\r\nthe Austrian government, is the most aristocratic institution of the\r\nkind in the world, and as such it was well ranged against the French\r\narmy, the only great armed democratic force Europe had ever seen till\r\nthe present year. Democracy had the better in most of the engagements\r\nthat took place, though it had ever to fight hard for it, the Austrians\r\nrarely behaving otherwise than well in war. The Prussian army that did\r\nsuch great things last summer was conscribed from the people to an\r\nextent that has no parallel since the French Republic formed its armies;\r\nand it broke down the aristocratical force of Austria as effectively as\r\nCromwell's Ironsides,--who were enlisted and disciplined yeomen,--broke\r\nthrough, cut down, and rode over the high-born Cavaliers of England. Now\r\nwhat Austria's army encountered when it met the French and Prussian\r\narmies, the Austrian government has to encounter in the management of\r\naffairs. In the old diplomatic school, Austria could hold her own with\r\nany foe, or friend either,--the latter the more difficult matter of the\r\ntwo. There seldom have been abler men in their way than Kaunitz and\r\nMetternich, but they would be utterly useless were they to come back and\r\ntake charge of Austrian diplomacy, so changed is the world's state. And\r\ntheir successors are of their school, with abilities far inferior to\r\ntheirs. The people have now to be consulted, even when treaties are\r\narranged and political combinations made. Such a parcelling out of\r\ncountries as was so easily effected at Vienna in 1815 would no more be\r\npossible now, than it would be to get up a crusade, or to revive the\r\ntraffic in slaves. The ground which the people have gained in fifty\r\nyears' course they have no intention of giving up, rather meaning to\r\nstrengthen it and to extend it.\r\n\r\nThis is the reason why Austria cannot very hopefully look for a revival\r\nof her power, as it so often revived after defeat in old days, and under\r\nan entirely different state of things from that which now exists. A\r\npower has come into existence such as she has never been accustomed to\r\ndeal with, and of which her statesmen have no knowledge. An Austrian\r\nstatesman is scarcely more advanced than a Frenchman of the time of\r\nLouis Quatorze; and we verily believe that Louvois or Torcy would be\r\nquite as much at home in European politics at this moment as Mensdorff\r\nor Belcredi. Had they been well informed as to the condition of the\r\ntimes, they never would have so acted as to bring about the late war. It\r\nwas their reliance on the ability of mere governments to settle every\r\nquestion in dispute, that caused them to plunge into a conflict with\r\nPrussia and Italy, when their master's empire was bankrupt, and when\r\nmore or less of discontent existed in almost every part of that empire.\r\nStatesmen who knew the age, and who were aware of the change that has\r\ncome over Europe in half a century, would have told the Emperor that to\r\nrely on \"something turning up,\" after the ancient Austrian custom, would\r\nnot answer in 1866, and that peoples as well as princes had much to do\r\nwith the ordering of every nation's policy; and with every people\r\nAustria is unpopular. It is not difficult now to understand that Francis\r\nJoseph had a profound reliance on Napoleon III., that he believed the\r\nFrenchman would prevent his being driven to the wall, and that Prussia\r\nwould be the greatest sufferer by the war, as she would be forced to\r\npart with the Rhine provinces. His mistake with respect to France was\r\nnot a great one, as the French saw the triumph of Prussia with much\r\nbitterness of feeling, and gladly would have joined the Austrians; but\r\nthe mistake he made in regard to Germany was very great, and shows that\r\nhe and his advisers knew nothing of Germanic feeling. If they could thus\r\nerr on a point that was plain to every intelligent foreigner, how can we\r\nexpect them to exhibit more intelligence and more sense with respect to\r\nthe new state of things proceeding from the event of the war? If they\r\ncould not comprehend matters of fact at the beginning of last June, why\r\nshould we conclude that they will be Solomons hereafter? Brought face to\r\nface with a new state of things, they so proceeded as to convince all\r\nimpartial observers that they were wellnigh as ignorant of what had been\r\ngoing on among men, as the Seven Sleepers were when roused from their\r\nlong slumber. But for this, unless we assume that they were fools, not\r\nonly would they not have admitted war to be possible, but they never\r\nwould have allowed the coming about of such a state of things as led to\r\nthe dispute with Prussia. The entire action of the Austrian government\r\nwith reference to the affairs of Germany, for several years, was\r\nadmirably calculated to lead to what has taken place this year. That\r\ngovernment, had it been wise, never would have acted with Prussia in the\r\nmatter of the Danish duchies. It would have insisted on the fulfilment\r\nof the arrangement that was made years before, in which case it would\r\nhave been supported by the whole power of France and England, and not\r\nimprobably by that of Russia; and against so great an array of force,\r\nPrussia, even if backed by the opinion of Germany, never would have\r\nthought of contending,--and some of the German governments would have\r\nsided with the allies, and would have behaved much more efficiently than\r\nthey did in the late war. Prussia would have been isolated, as France\r\nwas in 1840; and that party which was opposed to Bismarck's policy would\r\nhave obtained control of her councils, the effect of which would have\r\nbeen to preserve peace, the very thing that was most necessary to\r\nAustria's welfare. Instead of opposing Prussia, Austria joined her, and\r\ninsisted on having a part in the very business that offended the Germans\r\nas much as it disgusted foreigners. Thus a state of things was brought\r\nabout which made a German war inevitable, while Austria was deprived of\r\nall aid from abroad. England's sympathies were with Austria, as against\r\nPrussia; and yet England had been shabbily treated by Austria in respect\r\nto the duchies, and it was impossible for her either to forget or\r\nforgive such treatment. France had less cause to be offended; but\r\nNapoleon III. could not have approved of action which seemed to be taken\r\nin disregard of his high position in Europe, and was calculated to\r\nadvance the ends of Prussia,--the power least respected by the\r\nFrench,--and which finally made of that power the destroyer of the\r\nsettlement of 1815,[32] a part the Emperor had intended for himself.\r\nHaving acted thus unwisely, and having no support from Russia, Austria\r\nshould have avoided war in 1866, at any cost; and it was in her power to\r\navoid it down to the time that she made the German Diet so proceed as to\r\nfurnish Prussia with an excellent reason for setting her well-prepared\r\narmies in motion against the ill-prepared forces of her foe. Noting the\r\nfolly of Austria, and observing that the French government, if M. de\r\nLavalette's circular can be depended upon as an expression of its\r\nsentiments, is all for peace, we can see no opening for that renewal of\r\nwarfare in Europe which the defeated party is said to desire, as an ally\r\nof France, in the expectation that she might recover the place she so\r\nlately lost. The reopening of the Eastern Question, of which much is\r\nsaid, might afford some hope to Austria, but not to the extent that is\r\nsupposed; for she is not strong enough at this time to be a powerful\r\nally of Russia as against Turkey, or of England in support of Turkey.\r\nShe has parted with her old importance; for there is no further hiding\r\nfrom the world that her system is vicious, and that nothing could be\r\ngained from an alliance with her, while any country with which she\r\nshould be associated would have to extend to her much support. She may\r\nrise again, but how, or in what manner, it is not in any man's power to\r\nsay.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[25] The following is the epigram of Matthias Corvinus:--\r\n\r\n    \"Bella gerant alii; tu felix nube!\r\n    Nam quæ Mars aliis dat tibi regna Venus.\"\r\n\r\nWhich Mr. Sterling thus renders:--\r\n\r\n    \"Fight those who will; let well-starred Austria wed,\r\n    And conquer kingdoms in the marriage-bed.\"\r\n\r\nSome other hand has given the following translation, or rather\r\namplification, of the epigram:--\r\n\r\n    \"Glad Austria wins by Hymen's silken chain\r\n    What other states in doubtful battles gain,\r\n    And while fierce Mars enriches meaner lands,\r\n    Receives possessions from fair Venus' hands.\"\r\n\r\nThere would seem to be an end of these fortunate marriages, no member of\r\nthe Austrian imperial family being now in condition to wed to much\r\nprofit. The Emperor Francis Joseph, who is yet a young man, took to wife\r\na Bavarian lady, said to be of extraordinary beauty, in 1854; and he has\r\na daughter, who was born in 1856, the same year with the French Prince\r\nImperial, whom she might marry, but that the two are children. Besides,\r\nmarriages between French princes and Austrian princesses have turned out\r\nso badly on two memorable occasions, within less than a century, that\r\neven the statesmen of Vienna and Paris might well be excused if they\r\nwere to think a third alliance quite impossible. The heir apparent to\r\nthe Austrian throne is but eight years old. The Emperor's next brother,\r\nFerdinand Maximilian,--well known in this country as Emperor of the\r\nMexicans,--made a good marriage, his wife being a daughter of the late\r\nLeopold I., King of the Belgians. She has labored with zeal to found an\r\nimperial dynasty in Mexico, but the task is beyond human strength. The\r\nimperial system fell in Mexico on the same day that Richmond fell into\r\nthe hands of General Grant. The fortunes of the Austrian prince and\r\nthose of Mr. Davis were bound up together, and together they fell.\r\n\r\n[26] We give the imperial anagram:--\r\n\r\n    A: Austria Alles\r\n    E: Est Erdreich\r\n    I: Imperare Ist\r\n    O: Orbi Oesterreich\r\n    U: Universo Unterthan.\r\n\r\n[27] Mr. Bryce credits Maximilian I. with the founding of the Austrian\r\nmonarchy. \"Of that monarchy,\" he observes, \"and of the power of the\r\nhouse of Hapsburg, Maximilian was, even more than Rudolph his ancestor,\r\nthe founder. Uniting in his person those wide domains through Germany\r\nwhich, had been dispersed among the collateral branches of his house,\r\nand claiming by his marriage with Mary of Burgundy most of the\r\nterritories of Charles the Bold, he was a prince greater than any who\r\nhad sat on the Teutonic throne since the death of Frederick II. But it\r\nwas as Archduke of Austria, Count of Tyrol, Duke of Styria and\r\nCarinthia, feudal superior of lands in Swabia, Alsace, and Switzerland,\r\nthat he was great, not as Roman Emperor. For just as from him the\r\nAustrian monarchy begins, so with him the Holy Empire in its old meaning\r\nends.\" (The Holy Roman Empire, pp. 343, 344.) Mr. Bryce's work is one of\r\nthe most valuable contributions to historical literature that have\r\nappeared in this century, and great expectations are entertained from\r\nthe future labors of one so liberally endowed with the historic faculty.\r\n\r\n[28] The division of the house of Austria into two branches, which alone\r\nprevented it from becoming supreme in Europe, and over much of the rest\r\nof the world, took place in 1521. After the death of their grandfather,\r\nCharles and Ferdinand possessed the Austrian territories in common, but\r\nin 1521 they made a division thereof. Ferdinand obtained Austria,\r\nCarinthia, Carniola, and Styria, and, in 1522, the Tyrol, and other\r\nprovinces. In 1531 he was chosen King of the Romans, which made him the\r\nsuccessor of Charles as Emperor. How Charles came, not merely to consent\r\nto his election, but to urge it, and to effect it in spite of\r\nopposition, when he had a son in his fourth year, is very strange. The\r\nreasons commonly given for his course are by no means sufficient to\r\naccount or it. Many years later he tried to undo his work, in order to\r\nobtain the imperial dignity for his son; but Ferdinand held on to what\r\nhe possessed, with true Austrian tenacity. Had Charles kept the imperial\r\ncrown for his son, as he might have done, Philip's imperial position\r\nmust have sufficed to give him control of the civilized world. He would\r\nhave made himself master of both France and England, and must have\r\nrendered the Reaction completely triumphant over the Reformation.\r\nFortunately, he failed to become Emperor, and during a portion of his\r\ntime the imperial throne was occupied by the best of all the Hapsburg\r\nsovereigns,--the wise, the tolerant, the humane, and the upright\r\nMaximillian II., who was the last man in Europe likely to give him any\r\naid in the prosecution of his vast tyrannical schemes. Besides, there\r\nwas a sort of coolness between the two branches of the great family,\r\nthat was not without its effect on the world's politics. Seldom has it\r\nhappened that a more important event has occurred than the election of\r\nFerdinand as King of the Romans. We are not to measure what might have\r\nbeen done by Philip II. as Emperor, by what was done by Charles V.; for\r\nCharles was a statesman, a politician, and, down to his latter years,\r\nwhen his health was utterly gone, he was no fanatic; but Phillip was a\r\nfanatic only, and a fierce one too, with a power of concentration such\r\nas his father never possessed. Then the contest between the Catholics\r\nand the Protestants was a far more serious one in Philip's time than it\r\nhad been in that of Charles, which alone would have sufficed to make his\r\noccupation of the imperial throne, had he occupied it, a matter of the\r\nlast importance.\r\n\r\n[29] The main line of the German Hapsburgs ended in 1619, with the death\r\nof the Emperor Matthias. He was succeeded by Ferdinand II., grandson of\r\nFerdinand I., and son of that Archduke Charles who was sometimes spoken\r\nof in connection with the possible marriage of Elizabeth of England. Out\r\nof Ferdinand II.'s elevation grew a new union of the entire family of\r\nHapsburg. During the long ascendency of the Cardinal-Duke of Lerma in\r\nthe Spanish councils, _temp_. Philip III., the breach between the two\r\nbranches, which had been more apparent than real, and yet not\r\nunimportant, was made complete by the minister's action, the policy he\r\npursued being such as was highly displeasing to the German Hapsburgs,\r\nwho had relapsed into bigotry. Philip III. set up pretensions to Hungary\r\nand Bohemia, as grandson of Maximilian II. Ferdinand, who was not yet\r\neither emperor or king, got rid of Philip's pretensions by promising to\r\nresign to him the Austrian possessions in Swabia. This led to the fall\r\nof Lerma, and to the reunion of the two branches of the Austrian house,\r\nbut for which it is probable Ferdinand II. might have been beaten in the\r\nearly days of the Thirty Years' War. It was to Spanish aid that\r\nFerdinand owed his early triumphs in that contest; and many years later,\r\nin 1634, the great victory of Nordlingen was gained for the Imperialists\r\nby the presence of ten thousand Spanish infantry in their army,--that\r\ninfantry which was still the first military body in Europe, not then\r\nhaving met with the disaster of Rocroy, which, however, was near at\r\nhand. This was a kind of Indian-summer revival of Spanish power, and at\r\nthe beginning of the new alliance between Madrid and Vienna, \"there\r\nappeared,\" says Rankè, \"a prospect of founding a compact Spanish\r\nhereditary dominion, which should directly link together Milan with the\r\nNetherlands, and so give the Spanish policy a necessary preponderance in\r\nthe affairs of Europe.\" Richelieu spoilt this fine prospect just as it\r\nseemed about to become a reality, and the Spanish Hapsburgs gradually\r\nsank into insignificance, and their line disappeared in 1700, on the\r\ndeath of Charles II., the most contemptible creature that ever wore a\r\ncrown, and scarcely man enough to be a respectable idiot. Such was the\r\ntermination of the great Austro-Burgundian dynasty that was founded by\r\nCharles V.,--at one time as majestic as \"the broad and winding Rhine,\"\r\nbut again, like the Rhine, running fast to insignificance.\r\n\r\n[30] If the house of Austria was not in the greatest danger it ever\r\nexperienced in 1704, its members and officers could affect to feel all\r\nbut absolutely desperate. The following letter, written in queer\r\nGerman-French, by the Imperial Minister near the English court, Count\r\nJohn Wenceslaus Wratislaw, to Queen Anne, conveys an almost ludicrous\r\nidea of the fright under which the Austrian chiefs suffered:--\"Madame,\r\nLe soussigné envoyé extraordinaire de sa Majesté Impériale ayant\r\nreprésenté de vive voix en diverses occasions aux ministres de votre\r\nMajesté la dure extremité dans laquelle se trouve l'Empire, par\r\nl'introduction d'une armée nombreuse de François dans la Bavière,\r\nlaquelle jointe à la revolte de la Hongrie met les païs héréditaires de\r\nsa Majesté Impériale dans une confusion incroyable, de sorte que si l'on\r\nn'apporte pas un remède prompt et proportionné au danger présent, dont\r\non est menacé on a à craindre une revolution entière, et une destruction\r\ntotale de l'Allemagne.\" Luckily for Austria, Marlborough was a man of as\r\nmuch moral as physical courage, and he took the responsibility of\r\nleading his army into Germany,--a decision that, perhaps, no other\r\ncommander of that time would have been equal to,--and by the junction of\r\nhis forces with those of Eugène was enabled to fight and win the battle\r\nof Blenheim (Blindheim), which put an end to the ascendency of France.\r\nEmperor Leopold was positively grateful for the services Marlborough\r\nrendered him, and treated him differently from the manner in which he\r\nhad treated Sobieski for doing him quite as great a favor. He wrote him\r\na letter in his own hand, gave him a lordship in fee, and made him, by\r\nthe title of Mindelheim, a Prince of the Holy Roman Empire.\r\n\r\n[31] As it is generally assumed that Richelieu got the better of the\r\nEmpire in that contest which he waged with it, perhaps some readers may\r\nthink we have gone too far in saying he was one of those antagonists of\r\nwhom the Austrian family got the better; but all depends upon the point\r\nof view. Richelieu died when the war was at its height, and did not live\r\nto see the success of his immediate policy; but what he did was only an\r\nincident in a long contest. The old rivalry of the house of Valois and\r\nthe house of Austria was continued after the former was succeeded by the\r\nhouse of Bourbon. Richelieu did but carry out the policy on which Henry\r\nIV. had determined: and when the two branches of the Austrian family had\r\nunited their powers, and it seemed that the effect of their reunion\r\nwould be to place Europe at their command, the great Cardinal-Duke had\r\nno choice but to follow the ancient course of France. But the contest on\r\nwhich he entered, though in one sense fatal to his enemy, was not\r\ndecided in his time, nor till he had been in his grave more than sixty\r\nyears. He died just before the beginning of the reign of Louis XIV., and\r\nthat monarch took up and continued the contest which Richelieu may be\r\nsaid to have renewed. For an unusually long period the Bourbons were\r\nsuccessful, though without fully accomplishing their purpose. From the\r\nbattle of Rocroy, in 1643, to the battle of Blenheim, in 1704, France\r\nwas the first nation of Europe, and the Bourbons could boost of having\r\nhumiliated the Hapsburgs. They obtained the crowns of Spain and the\r\nIndies; and the Spanish crowns are yet worn by a descendant of Louis le\r\nGrand, while another family reigns in France. But Spain and her\r\ndependencies apart, all was changed by the result at Blenheim. The\r\nAustrian house was there saved, and re-established; and it was there\r\nthat the policy of Richelieu had its final decision. The France of the\r\nold monarchy never recovered from the disasters its armies met with in\r\nthe War of the Spanish Succession; and when Louis XV. consented to the\r\nmarriage of his grandson to an Austrian princess, he virtually admitted\r\nthat the old rival of his family had triumphed in the long strife. The\r\nquarrel was again renewed in the days of the Republic, maintained under\r\nthe first French Empire, and had its last trial of arms under the second\r\nEmpire, in 1859; but the old French monarchy gave up the contest more\r\nthan a century ago. Besides, we are to distinguish between the German\r\nEmpire and the house of Hapsburg that ruled from Vienna. The Peace of\r\nWestphalia (1648) left the Germanic Emperors in a contemptible state,\r\nbut the effect of it was highly favorable to these Emperors considered\r\nas chiefs of the Hapsburg family. \"Placed on the eastern verge of\r\nGermany,\" says Mr. Bryce, \"the Hapsburgs had added to their ancient\r\nlands in Austria proper and the Tyrol new German territories far more\r\nextensive, and had thus become the chiefs of a separate and independent\r\nstate. They endeavored to reconcile its interests and those of the\r\nEmpire, so long as it seemed possible to recover part of the old\r\nimperial prerogative. But when such hopes were dashed by the defeats of\r\nthe Thirty Years' War, they hesitated no longer between an elective\r\ncrown and the rule of their hereditary states, and comforted themselves\r\nthenceforth in European politics, not as the representatives of Germany,\r\nbut as heads of the great Austrian monarchy.\" (The Holy Roman Empire,\r\nnew edition, p. 355.) Thus, by diverting the Hapsburgs from their\r\nimpracticable schemes, and throwing them upon their hereditary\r\npossessions, Richelieu really helped them; and in so far his policy was\r\na failure, as he sought to lessen the power of the house of Austria,\r\nwhich in his time ruled over Spain, as well as in Germany, Bohemia,\r\nHungary, and other countries. It is intimated by some European writers,\r\nthat the Austrian family will once more turn its attention to the East,\r\nand, giving up all thought of regaining its place in Germany, seek\r\ncompensation where it was found in the seventeenth century, after the\r\nPeace of Westphalia. But what was possible two hundred years ago might\r\nbe found impossible to-day. Russia had no existence as a European power\r\nin those days, whereas now she has one of the highest places in Europe,\r\nand a very peculiar interest in not allowing Austria, or any other\r\nnation, to obtain possession of countries like the Roumanian\r\nPrincipalities, the addition of which to his empire might afford\r\ncompensation to Francis Joseph for all he has lost in the south and the\r\nwest. It is one of the infelicities of Austria's position that she\r\ncannot make a movement in any direction without treading on the toes of\r\nsome giant, or on those of a dwarf protected by some giant who who\r\nintends himself ultimately to devour him.\r\n\r\n[32] Prussia, the most thoroughly anti-Gallican of all the parties to\r\nthe Treaty of Vienna, completed the work of overthrowing the \"detested\"\r\narrangements made by the framers of that treaty. The federal act\r\ncreating the Germanic Confederation was incorporated in the work of the\r\nCongress of Vienna, and was guaranteed by eight European\r\npowers,--France, England, Russia, Prussia, Sweden, Austria, Spain, and\r\nPortugal. Prussia destroyed the Confederation without troubling herself\r\nabout the wishes and opinions of the other seven parties to the\r\narrangement of 1815. That all those parties to that arrangement were not\r\nalways indifferent to their guaranty appears from the opposition made by\r\nRussia, France, and England to Prince Schwarzenburg's proposition, that\r\nAustria should be allowed to introduce all her non-Germanic territories\r\ninto the Confederation, that is to say, that the _Austrian Empire_,\r\nwhich then included the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom, should become a part\r\nof Germany, which it would soon have ruled, as well as overruled, while\r\nit would have extended its dominion over Italy. Had Schwarzenburg's\r\nproject succeeded, the course of European events during the last sixteen\r\nyears must have been entirely changed, or Austria would have been made\r\ntoo strong to be harmed by the French in Italy, or by the Prussians in\r\nGermany and Bohemia. Russia was specially adverse to that project; and\r\nthe Treaty of Vienna was forcibly appealed to by her government in\r\nopposing it. The time had not then come for making waste-paper of the\r\narrangements of 1815.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRECONSTRUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe assembling of the Second Session of the Thirty-ninth Congress may\r\nvery properly be made the occasion of a few earnest words on the already\r\nmuch-worn topic of reconstruction.\r\n\r\nSeldom has any legislative body been the subject of a solicitude more\r\nintense, or of aspirations more sincere and ardent. There are the best\r\nof reasons for this profound interest. Questions of vast moment, left\r\nundecided by the last session of Congress, must be manfully grappled\r\nwith by this. No political skirmishing will avail. The occasion demands\r\nstatesmanship.\r\n\r\nWhether the tremendous war so heroically fought and so victoriously\r\nended shall pass into history a miserable failure, barren of permanent\r\nresults,--a scandalous and shocking waste of blood and treasure,--a\r\nstrife for empire, as Earl Russell characterized it, of no value to\r\nliberty or civilization,--an attempt to re-establish a Union by force,\r\nwhich must be the merest mockery of a Union,--an effort to bring under\r\nFederal authority States into which no loyal man from the North may\r\nsafely enter, and to bring men into the national councils who deliberate\r\nwith daggers and vote with revolvers, and who do not even conceal their\r\ndeadly hate of the country that conquered them; or whether, on the other\r\nhand, we shall, as the rightful reward of victory over treason, have a\r\nsolid nation, entirely delivered from all contradictions and social\r\nantagonisms, based upon loyalty, liberty, and equality, must be\r\ndetermined one way or the other by the present session of Congress. The\r\nlast session really did nothing which can be considered final as to\r\nthese questions. The Civil Rights Bill and the Freedmen's Bureau Bill\r\nand the proposed constitutional amendments, with the amendment already\r\nadopted and recognized as the law of the land, do not reach the\r\ndifficulty, and cannot, unless the whole structure of the government is\r\nchanged from a government by States to something like a despotic central\r\ngovernment, with power to control even the municipal regulations of\r\nStates, and to make them conform to its own despotic will. While there\r\nremains such an idea as the right of each State to control its own local\r\naffairs,--an idea, by the way, more deeply rooted in the minds of men\r\nof all sections of the country than perhaps any one other political\r\nidea,--no general assertion of human rights can be of any practical\r\nvalue. To change the character of the government at this point is\r\nneither possible nor desirable. All that is necessary to be done is to\r\nmake the government consistent with itself, and render the rights of the\r\nStates compatible with the sacred rights of human nature.\r\n\r\nThe arm of the Federal government is long, but it is far too short to\r\nprotect the rights of individuals in the interior of distant States.\r\nThey must have the power to protect themselves, or they will go\r\nunprotected, spite of all the laws the Federal government can put upon\r\nthe national statute-book.\r\n\r\nSlavery, like all other great systems of wrong, founded in the depths of\r\nhuman selfishness, and existing for ages, has not neglected its own\r\nconservation. It has steadily exerted an influence upon all around it\r\nfavorable to its own continuance. And to-day it is so strong that it\r\ncould exist, not only without law, but even against law. Custom,\r\nmanners, morals, religion, are all on its side everywhere in the South;\r\nand when you add the ignorance and servility of the ex-slave to the\r\nintelligence and accustomed authority of the master, you have the\r\nconditions, not out of which slavery will again grow, but under which it\r\nis impossible for the Federal government to wholly destroy it, unless\r\nthe Federal government be armed with despotic power, to blot out State\r\nauthority, and to station a Federal officer at every cross-road. This,\r\nof course, cannot be done, and ought not even if it could. The true way\r\nand the easiest way is to make our government entirely consistent with\r\nitself, and give to every loyal citizen the elective franchise,--a right\r\nand power which will be ever present, and will form a wall of fire for\r\nhis protection.\r\n\r\nOne of the invaluable compensations of the late Rebellion is the highly\r\ninstructive disclosure it made of the true source of danger to\r\nrepublican government. Whatever may be tolerated in monarchical and\r\ndespotic governments, no republic is safe that tolerates a privileged\r\nclass, or denies to any of its citizens equal rights and equal means to\r\nmaintain them. What was theory before the war has been made fact by the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nThere is cause to be thankful even for rebellion. It is an impressive\r\nteacher, though a stern and terrible one. In both characters it has come\r\nto us, and it was perhaps needed in both. It is an instructor never a\r\nday before its time, for it comes only when all other means of progress\r\nand enlightenment have failed. Whether the oppressed and despairing\r\nbondman, no longer able to repress his deep yearnings for manhood, or\r\nthe tyrant, in his pride and impatience, takes the initiative, and\r\nstrikes the blow for a firmer hold and a longer lease of oppression, the\r\nresult is the same,--society is instructed, or may be.\r\n\r\nSuch are the limitations of the common mind, and so thoroughly\r\nengrossing are the cares of common life, that only the few among men can\r\ndiscern through the glitter and dazzle of present prosperity the dark\r\noutlines of approaching disasters, even though they may have come up to\r\nour very gates, and are already within striking distance. The yawning\r\nseam and corroded bolt conceal their defects from the mariner until the\r\nstorm calls all hands to the pumps. Prophets, indeed, were abundant\r\nbefore the war; but who cares for prophets while their predictions\r\nremain unfulfilled, and the calamities of which they tell are masked\r\nbehind a blinding blaze of national prosperity?\r\n\r\nIt is asked, said Henry Clay, on a memorable occasion, Will slavery\r\nnever come to an end? That question, said he, was asked fifty years ago,\r\nand it has been answered by fifty years of unprecedented prosperity.\r\nSpite of the eloquence of the earnest Abolitionists,--poured out against\r\nslavery during thirty years,--even they must confess, that, in all the\r\nprobabilities of the case, that system of barbarism would have\r\ncontinued its horrors far beyond the limits of the nineteenth century\r\nbut for the Rebellion, and perhaps only have disappeared at last in a\r\nfiery conflict, even more fierce and bloody than that which has now been\r\nsuppressed.\r\n\r\nIt is no disparagement to truth, that it can only prevail where reason\r\nprevails. War begins where reason ends. The thing worse than rebellion\r\nis the thing that causes rebellion. What that thing is, we have been\r\ntaught to our cost. It remains now to be seen whether we have the needed\r\ncourage to have that cause entirely removed from the Republic. At any\r\nrate, to this grand work of national regeneration and entire\r\npurification Congress must now address itself, with full purpose that\r\nthe work shall this time be thoroughly done. The deadly upas, root and\r\nbranch, leaf and fibre, body and sap, must be utterly destroyed. The\r\ncountry is evidently not in a condition to listen patiently to pleas for\r\npostponement, however plausible, nor will it permit the responsibility\r\nto be shifted to other shoulders. Authority and power are here\r\ncommensurate with the duty imposed. There are no cloud-flung shadows to\r\nobscure the way. Truth shines with brighter light and intenser heat at\r\nevery moment, and a country torn and rent and bleeding implores relief\r\nfrom its distress and agony.\r\n\r\nIf time was at first needed, Congress has now had time. All the\r\nrequisite materials from which to form an intelligent judgment are now\r\nbefore it. Whether its members look at the origin, the progress, the\r\ntermination of the war, or at the mockery of a peace now existing, they\r\nwill find only one unbroken chain of argument in favor of a radical\r\npolicy of reconstruction. For the omissions of the last session, some\r\nexcuses may be allowed. A treacherous President stood in the way; and it\r\ncan be easily seen how reluctant good men might be to admit an apostasy\r\nwhich involved so much of baseness and ingratitude. It was natural that\r\nthey should seek to save him by bending to him even when he leaned to\r\nthe side of error. But all is changed now. Congress knows now that it\r\nmust go on without his aid, and even against his machinations. The\r\nadvantage of the present session over the last is immense. Where that\r\ninvestigated, this has the facts. Where that walked by faith, this may\r\nwalk by sight. Where that halted, this must go forward, and where that\r\nfailed, this must succeed, giving the country whole measures where that\r\ngave us half-measures, merely as a means of saving the elections in a\r\nfew doubtful districts. That Congress saw what was right, but distrusted\r\nthe enlightenment of the loyal masses; but what was forborne in distrust\r\nof the people must now be done with a full knowledge that the people\r\nexpect and require it. The members go to Washington fresh from the\r\ninspiring presence of the people. In every considerable public meeting,\r\nand in almost every conceivable way, whether at court-house,\r\nschool-house, or cross-roads, in doors and out, the subject has been\r\ndiscussed, and the people have emphatically pronounced in favor of a\r\nradical policy. Listening to the doctrines of expediency and compromise\r\nwith pity, impatience, and disgust, they have everywhere broken into\r\ndemonstrations of the wildest enthusiasm when a brave word has been\r\nspoken in favor of equal rights and impartial suffrage. Radicalism, so\r\nfar from being odious, is now the popular passport to power. The men\r\nmost bitterly charged with it go to Congress with the largest\r\nmajorities, while the timid and doubtful are sent by lean majorities, or\r\nelse left at home. The strange controversy between the President and\r\nCongress, at one time so threatening, is disposed of by the people. The\r\nhigh reconstructive powers which he so confidently, ostentatiously, and\r\nhaughtily claimed, have been disallowed, denounced, and utterly\r\nrepudiated; while those claimed by Congress have been confirmed.\r\n\r\nOf the spirit and magnitude of the canvass nothing need be said. The\r\nappeal was to the people, and the verdict was worthy of the tribunal.\r\nUpon an occasion of his own selection, with the advice and approval of\r\nhis astute Secretary, soon after the members of Congress had returned to\r\ntheir constituents, the President quitted the executive mansion,\r\nsandwiched himself between two recognized heroes,--men whom the whole\r\ncountry delighted to honor,--and, with all the advantage which such\r\ncompany could give him, stumped the country from the Atlantic to the\r\nMississippi, advocating everywhere his policy as against that of\r\nCongress. It was a strange sight, and perhaps the most disgraceful\r\nexhibition ever made by any President; but, as no evil is entirely\r\nunmixed, good has come of this, as from many others. Ambitious,\r\nunscrupulous, energetic, indefatigable, voluble, and plausible,--a\r\npolitical gladiator, ready for a \"set-to\" in any crowd,--he is beaten in\r\nhis own chosen field, and stands to-day before the country as a\r\nconvicted usurper, a political criminal, guilty of a bold and persistent\r\nattempt to possess himself of the legislative powers solemnly secured to\r\nCongress by the Constitution. No vindication could be more complete, no\r\ncondemnation could be more absolute and humiliating. Unless reopened by\r\nthe sword, as recklessly threatened in some circles, this question is\r\nnow closed for all time.\r\n\r\nWithout attempting to settle here the metaphysical and somewhat\r\ntheological question (about which so much has already been said and\r\nwritten), whether once in the Union means always in the\r\nUnion,--agreeably to the formula, Once in grace always in grace,--it is\r\nobvious to common sense that the rebellious States stand to-day, in\r\npoint of law, precisely where they stood when, exhausted, beaten,\r\nconquered, they fell powerless at the feet of Federal authority. Their\r\nState governments were overthrown, and the lives and property of the\r\nleaders of the Rebellion were forfeited. In reconstructing the\r\ninstitutions of these shattered and overthrown States, Congress should\r\nbegin with a clean slate, and make clean work of it. Let there be no\r\nhesitation. It would be a cowardly deference to a defeated and\r\ntreacherous President, if any account were made of the illegitimate,\r\none-sided, sham governments hurried into existence for a malign purpose\r\nin the absence of Congress. These pretended governments, which were\r\nnever submitted to the people, and from participation in which four\r\nmillions of the loyal people were excluded by Presidential order, should\r\nnow be treated according to their true character, as shams and\r\nimpositions, and supplanted by true and legitimate governments, in the\r\nformation of which loyal men, black and white, shall participate.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, within the scope of this paper to point out the\r\nprecise steps to be taken, and the means to be employed. The people are\r\nless concerned about these than the grand end to be attained. They\r\ndemand such a reconstruction as shall put an end to the present\r\nanarchical state of things in the late rebellious States,--where\r\nfrightful murders and wholesale massacres are perpetrated in the very\r\npresence of Federal soldiers. This horrible business they require shall\r\ncease. They want a reconstruction such as will protect loyal men, black\r\nand white, in their persons and property; such a one as will cause\r\nNorthern industry, Northern capital, and Northern civilization to flow\r\ninto the South, and make a man from New England as much at home in\r\nCarolina as elsewhere in the Republic. No Chinese wall can now be\r\ntolerated. The South must be opened to the light of law and liberty, and\r\nthis session of Congress is relied upon to accomplish this important\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe plain, common-sense way of doing this work, as intimated at the\r\nbeginning, is simply to establish in the South one law, one government,\r\none administration of justice, one condition to the exercise of the\r\nelective franchise, for men of all races and colors alike. This great\r\nmeasure is sought as earnestly by loyal white men as by loyal blacks,\r\nand is needed alike by both. Let sound political prescience but take the\r\nplace of an unreasoning prejudice, and this will be done.\r\n\r\nMen denounce the negro for his prominence in this discussion; but it is\r\nno fault of his that in peace as in war, that in conquering Rebel armies\r\nas in reconstructing the rebellious States, the right of the negro is\r\nthe true solution of our national troubles. The stern logic of events,\r\nwhich goes directly to the point, disdaining all concern for the color\r\nor features of men, has determined the interests of the country as\r\nidentical with and inseparable from those of the negro.\r\n\r\nThe policy that emancipated and armed the negro--now seen to have been\r\nwise and proper by the dullest--was not certainly more sternly demanded\r\nthan is now the policy of enfranchisement. If with the negro was success\r\nin war, and without him failure, so in peace it will be found that the\r\nnation must fall or flourish with the negro.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the Constitution of the United States knows no distinction\r\nbetween citizens on account of color. Neither does it know any\r\ndifference between a citizen of a State and a citizen of the United\r\nStates. Citizenship evidently includes all the rights of citizens,\r\nwhether State or national. If the Constitution knows none, it is clearly\r\nno part of the duty of a Republican Congress now to institute one. The\r\nmistake of the last session was the attempt to do this very thing, by a\r\nrenunciation of its power to secure political rights to any class of\r\ncitizens, with the obvious purpose to allow the rebellious States to\r\ndisfranchise, if they should see fit, their colored citizens. This\r\nunfortunate blunder must now be retrieved, and the emasculated\r\ncitizenship given to the negro supplanted by that contemplated in the\r\nConstitution of the United States, which declares that the citizens of\r\neach State shall enjoy all the rights and immunities of citizens of the\r\nseveral States,--so that a legal voter in any State shall be a legal\r\nvoter in all the States.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nREVIEWS AND LITERARY NOTICES.\r\n\r\n\r\n_History of the United States, from the Discovery of the American\r\nContinent._ By GEORGE BANCROFT. Vol. IX. Boston: Little, Brown,\r\n& Co.\r\n\r\nThis volume of Mr. Bancroft's History, the ninth of the entire work and\r\nthe third of the narrative of the American Revolution, comprises the\r\nperiod between July, 1776, and April, 1778, including the battles of\r\nLong Island and White Plains, the surrender of Fort Washington, the\r\nretreat of Washington through the Jerseys, the brilliant military\r\nsuccesses of Trenton and Princeton, the capture of Philadelphia by Sir\r\nWilliam Howe, and the memorable event which insured the success of the\r\nRevolution,--the surrender of Burgoyne. This enumeration is enough to\r\nshow that, in the ground he has traversed, Mr. Bancroft has found ample\r\nscope for the display of those peculiar literary characteristics with\r\nwhich the readers of his former volumes are so familiar,--his rapid and\r\ncondensed narration, his sweeping and sometimes rather vague\r\ngeneralizations, his brilliant pictures, his pointed reflections, and\r\nthe sharp, cutting strokes with which he carves rather than paints\r\ncharacters. His usual diligence in the search of materials has not\r\ndeserted him here; and he has been even more than usually successful in\r\nthe amount and character of what he has found. In addition to very full\r\ncollections relating to the war from the archives of England and France,\r\nhe has obtained large masses of papers from Germany, among which last\r\nare many of great importance, especially for the study of military\r\noperations in 1777. Very valuable documents from the Spanish have been\r\nsecured, through the courtesy of the Spanish government and the kind\r\noffices of that distinguished scholar and most amiable man, Don Pascual\r\nde Gayangos.\r\n\r\nInvestigators of the past are naturally inclined to overestimate the\r\nvalue of any new sources of information opened by their own diligence or\r\nsagacity of research, and a little of this feeling is perceptible in Mr.\r\nBancroft's Preface; but, after all, we apprehend that the new evidence\r\nhe has so diligently collected will not shake the deliberate verdict\r\nalready passed alike upon men and events. Here and there a gleam is\r\nthrown upon some single incident, or the motives and conduct of a\r\nparticular actor; but the general lights and shadows of the historical\r\nlandscape remain undisturbed. The statements and the views of Marshall\r\nand Sparks are substantially sustained. The patriotic American will not\r\nregret to see that Mr. Bancroft's investigations and conclusions lead\r\nhim to exalt Washington in comparison with the soldiers and civilians\r\nwho stood around him; and the reader of his pages will have fresh cause\r\nto admire, not merely the firmness and self-command of that illustrious\r\nman, but his abilities as a commander and a statesman. We have\r\nespecially to thank Mr. Bancroft for the distinctness with which he\r\nshows how much the success of the Northern army was due to Washington's\r\ndisinterested advice. His high praise of the commander-in-chief\r\nsometimes glances aslope, and lights in the form of censure of some of\r\nhis subordinate officers; and we should not be surprised if some of his\r\nstrictures provoked replies and led to controversies. Some of those whom\r\nhe criticises have left descendants, and those who have left no\r\ndescendants have partisans who are jealous of the fame of their\r\nfavorites, and will not lightly allow a leaf of their laurels to be\r\nblighted.\r\n\r\nDuring the period embraced by this volume the constitutions of several\r\nof the States were formed, and the Articles of Confederation were\r\nadopted which gave to the several States a semblance of unity, and\r\nsmoothed the path to the more perfect union which was established ten\r\nyears later. These events present themes peculiarly congenial to Mr.\r\nBancroft's powers of brilliant generalization and rapid condensation,\r\nand tempt him into that field of discursive reflection where he is fond\r\nof lingering, and where we follow him always with interest, and\r\ngenerally with assent. We quote with peculiar pleasure the following\r\nobservations from the fifteenth chapter, on the constitutions of the\r\nseveral States of America, as being sound in substance and happy in\r\nexpression:--\r\n\r\n\"The spirit of the age moved the young, nation to own justice as\r\nantecedent and superior to the state, and to found the rights of the\r\ncitizen on the rights of man. And yet, in regenerating its institutions,\r\nit was not guided by any speculative theory or laborious application of\r\nmetaphysical distinctions. Its form of government grew naturally out of\r\nits traditions, by the simple rejection of all personal hereditary\r\nauthority, which in America had never had much more than a\r\nrepresentative existence. Its people were industrious and frugal.\r\nAccustomed to the cry of liberty and property, they harbored no dream of\r\na community of goods; and their love of equality never degenerated into\r\nenvy of the rich. No successors of the fifth-monarchy men proposed to\r\nsubstitute an unwritten higher law, interpreted by individual\r\nconscience, for the law of the land and the decrees of human tribunals.\r\nThe people proceeded with self-possession and moderation, after the\r\nmanner of their ancestors. Their large inheritance of English liberties\r\nsaved them from the necessity and from the wish to uproot their old\r\npolitical institutions; and as happily the scaffold was not wet with the\r\nblood of their statesmen, there was no root of a desperate hatred of\r\nEngland, such as the Netherlands kept up for centuries against Spain.\r\nThe wrongs inflicted or attempted by the British king were felt to have\r\nbeen avenged by independence. Respect and affection remained behind for\r\nthe parent land, from which the United States had derived trial by jury,\r\nthe writ for personal liberty, the practice of representative\r\ngovernment, and the separation of the three great co-ordinate powers in\r\nthe state. From an essentially aristocratic model, America took just\r\nwhat suited her condition, and rejected the rest. Thus the transition of\r\nthe Colonies into self-existent commonwealths was free from vindictive\r\nbitterness, and attended by no violent or wide departure from the past.\"\r\n\r\nA considerable portion of this volume is occupied by a consideration of\r\nthe relations between Europe and America. Advancing years do not seem to\r\nchill Mr. Bancroft's faith in progress, his confidence in democracy, his\r\nlove of popular institutions, or to check his tendency to throw his\r\nspeculations into an aphoristic form, and to present his conclusions\r\npositively, and with less of qualification and limitation than men of a\r\nmore cautious temperament would do. So far as literary merit is\r\nconcerned, the European chapters will be found the most attractive in\r\nthe volume. They are sparkling, rapid, condensed, and pointed; they\r\ngratify our national pride; their animated and picturesque style never\r\nsuffers the attention to flag for a moment;--and yet it is in these very\r\nchapters that judicial criticism will find the most frequent occasion to\r\npause and doubt, whether we consider the direction in which the stream\r\nof thought flows, or their merely rhetorical features. Mr. Bancroft's\r\nglittering generalizations do not always seem to us to wear the sober\r\nlivery of truth. For instance, on page 500 we read: \"The most stupendous\r\nthought that ever was conceived by man, such as never had been dared by\r\nSocrates or the Academy, by Aristotle or the Stoics, took possession of\r\nDescartes on a November night in his meditations on the banks of the\r\nDanube.\" It may be coldness of temperament, it may be the chilling\r\ninfluence of advancing years, but we cannot admire statements like\r\nthese, and we are constrained to think them exaggerated and extravagant.\r\n\r\nAnd on the next page Mr. Bancroft says: \"Edwards, Reid, Kant, and\r\nRousseau were all imbued with religiosity, and all except the last, who\r\nspoiled his doctrine by dreamy indolence, were expositors of the active\r\npowers of man.\" It is certainly an ingenious mind that finds a\r\nresemblance between Edwards and Rousseau. What exactly is the meaning of\r\n\"religiosity,\" we cannot say; but if it be used as a synonyme of\r\nreligion, we demur to the assertion that Rousseau was imbued with\r\nreligion,--Rousseau, who in his youth allowed an innocent girl to be\r\nruined by accusing her of a theft which he himself had committed, and in\r\nhis ripened manhood sent to a foundling hospital the children he had had\r\nby his mistress,--whose life was despicable and whose moral creed seemed\r\nto be summed up in the doctrine that every natural impulse is to be\r\nindulged. Rousseau was an enthusiast and a sentimentalist; he was a man\r\nof the exquisite organization of genius, and there are many passages in\r\nhis writings which are colored with a half-voluptuous, half-devotional\r\nglow; but it seems to us a plain confusion of very obvious moral\r\ndistinctions to represent such a man as imbued with the spirit of\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nOne of the most animated of Mr. Bancroft's chapters is the eighth, on\r\nthe course of opinion in England, in which we have glimpses of Wilkes,\r\nof Barre, of Wedderburn, of Lord North, of Burke, and an elaborate\r\ncharacter of Fox. This last is a happy specimen of Mr. Bancroft's\r\npeculiar style of portrait-drawing. The merits and defects of the\r\nsubject are presented in a series of pointed and aphoristic sentences;\r\nand the likeness is gained, as in a portrait of Rembrandt, by the\r\npowerful contrast and proximity of lights and shadows. Virtues and vices\r\nstand side by side, like the black and white squares of a chess-board.\r\nBrilliant as the execution is, the man Charles James Fox seems to us\r\nreproduced with more distinctness and individuality in the easier,\r\nsimpler, more flowing sentences of Lord Brougham. Mr. Bancroft's sketch\r\nhas something of the coldness as well as the sharp outline of\r\nbas-relief. And strange to say, considering Fox's love of liberty, his\r\nlove of America, and his hatred of slavery, the historian of liberty and\r\ndemocracy seems hardly to have done him justice. In the summary of the\r\ncontents of the chapters prefixed to the volume, he unreservedly writes\r\ndown \"Fox not a great man,\" and such is the impression which the text\r\nleaves on the mind; but if Fox was not a great man, to whom in the\r\nsphere of government and politics can that praise be accorded?\r\n\r\nIn his Preface to this volume, Mr. Bancroft informs us that one more\r\nvolume will complete the American Revolution, including the negotiations\r\nfor peace in 1782; and that for this the materials are collected and\r\narranged, and that it will be completed and published without any\r\nunnecessary delay. This volume will bring into the field Spain, France,\r\nand Great Britain, as well as the United States, and, from the nature of\r\nthe subject it presents, will undoubtedly be so treated by Mr. Bancroft\r\nas to be not inferior in interest or value to any of its predecessors.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Griffith Gaunt; or Jealousy_. By CHARLES READE. With\r\nIllustrations. Boston: Ticknor and Fields.\r\n\r\nIn discussing the qualities of this remarkable novel before the readers\r\nof \"The Atlantic Monthly,\" we shall have an advantage not always enjoyed\r\nby criticism; for we shall speak to an audience perfectly familiar with\r\nevery detail of the story, and shall not be troubled to _résumer_ its\r\nevents and characters. There has been much doubt among many worthy\r\npeople concerning Mr. Reade's management of the moralities and the\r\nproprieties, but no question at all, we think, as to the wonderful power\r\nhe has shown, and the interest he has awakened. Even those who have\r\nblamed him have followed him eagerly,--without doubt to see what\r\ncrowning insult he would put upon decency, and to be confirmed in their\r\nvirtuous abhorrence of his work. It is to be hoped that these have been\r\ndisappointed, for it must be confessed that, in the _dénouement_ of the\r\nnovel, others who totally differed from them in purpose and opinion have\r\nbeen brought to some confusion.\r\n\r\nIt is not as a moralist that we have primarily to find fault with Mr.\r\nReade, but as an artist, for his moral would have been good if his art\r\nhad been true. The work, up to the conclusion of Catharine Gaunt's\r\ntrial, is in all respects too fine and high to provoke any reproach from\r\nus; after that, we can only admire it as a piece of literary gallantry\r\nand desperate resolution. \"C'est magnifique; mais ce n'est pas la\r\nguerre.\" It is courageous, but it is not art. It is because of the\r\nsplendid _elan_ in all Mr. Reade writes, that in his failure he does not\r\nfall flat upon the compassion of his reader, as Mr. Dickens does with\r\nhis \"Golden Dustman.\" But it is a failure, nevertheless; and it must\r\nbecome a serious question in æsthetics how far the spellbound reader may\r\nbe tortured with an interest which the power awakening it is not\r\nadequate to gratify. Is it generous, is it just in a novelist, to lift\r\nus up to a pitch of tragic frenzy, and then drop us down into the last\r\nscene of a comic opera? We refuse to be comforted by the fact that the\r\nnovelist does not, perhaps, consciously mock our expectation.\r\n\r\nLet us take the moral of \"Griffith Gaunt,\"--so poignant and effective\r\nfor the most part,--and see how lamentably it suffers from the defective\r\nart of the _dénouement_. In brief: up to the end of Mrs. Gaunt's trial\r\nwe are presented with a terrible image of the evils that jealousy,\r\nanger, and lies bring upon their guilty and innocent victims. Griffith\r\nGaunt is made to suffer--as men in life suffer--a dreadful remorse and\r\nanguish for the crimes he has committed and the falsehoods to which they\r\nhave committed him. A man with a heart at first tender and true becomes\r\na son of perdition, utterly incapable of tenderness and\r\ntruth,--consciously held away from them by ever-cumulative force. The\r\nspectacle is not new,--it is old as sin itself; but it is here revealed\r\nwith the freshest and most authentic power, and with a repelling\r\nefficacy which we have seldom seen equalled in literature. Mrs. Gaunt\r\njustly endures the trouble brought upon her by pride and unbridled bad\r\ntemper, and unavoidably endures the consequences of another's wrong.\r\nMercy Vint is a guiltless and lovely sacrifice to both almost equally.\r\n\r\nWhat is the end? Mercy Vint is given in marriage to the honestest and\r\nfaithfulest gentleman in the book, whose heroism we admire without\r\nenvying. But in any case so good a woman would have achieved peace for\r\nherself, and it is at some cost to our regard for her entirety that we\r\nconsent to see her rewarded by being made a nobleman's wife and the\r\nmother of nine children. In this character she lives a life less perfect\r\nand consequent than she might have led in a station less exalted, but\r\ndistant from the circles in which she could not appear at the same time\r\nwith the man who had infamously wronged her without exciting whispers\r\npainful to herself and embarrassing to her husband. Indeed, there seems\r\nto be rather more of vicarious expiation in her fate than the interests\r\nof population and of \"young women who have been betrayed\" have any right\r\nto demand.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gaunt fully expiates her error before her trial ends. But how of\r\nher husband? Mr. Reade seems to like his Griffith Gaunt, who is not to\r\nour mind, and who is never less worthy of happiness than at the moment\r\nwhen his wife forgives him. It is not that he is a bigamist and betrayer\r\nof innocence that his redemption seems impossible through the means\r\nemployed; but how can Catharine Gaunt love a coward and sneak, even in\r\nthe wisdom which a court of justice has taught her? This furious and\r\nstupid traitor is afraid to appear and save his wife lest he be branded\r\nin the hand; and we are to pardon him because, at no risk to himself, he\r\ngives the worthless blood of his veins to rescue her from death. If the\r\nfable teaches anything in Griffith Gaunt's case, it is this: Betray two\r\nnoble women, and after some difficulty you shall get rid of one, be\r\nforgiven by the other, come into a handsome property, and have a large\r\nand interesting family. If the reader will take the fate of Griffith\r\nGaunt and contrast it with that of Tito Melema, in \"Romola,\" he shall\r\nsee all the difference that passes between an artificial and an artistic\r\nsolution of a moral problem.\r\n\r\nDefective art is noticeable in the minor as well as the principal\r\nfeatures of the _dénouement_ of Griffith Gaunt. There is the case of the\r\nunhappy little baby of Mercy. It is plain that the infant is a\r\nstumbling-block in its mother's path to Neville Cross; but we have\r\nscarcely begun to lament its presence, when it is swiftly put to death\r\nby a special despatch from the obliging destiny of the _dénouement_. The\r\nevent is a coincidence, to say the least, and is scarcely less an\r\noperation than the transfusion of blood by which Griffith Gaunt and his\r\nwife are preserved to a long life of happiness. But this part of the\r\nwork is full of wonders. The cruel enchantments are all dissolved by\r\nmore potent preternatural agencies, and a superhuman prosperity dwells\r\nalike with the just and the unjust,--Mrs. Ryder excepted, who will\r\nprobably go to the Devil as some slight compensation for the loss of\r\nGriffith Gaunt.\r\n\r\nBut if the conclusion of the fiction is weak, how great it is in every\r\nother part! The management of the plot was so masterly, that the story\r\nproceeded without a pause or an improbability until the long fast of a\r\nmonth falling between the feasts of its publication became almost\r\ninsupportable. It was a plot that grew naturally out of the characters,\r\nfor humanity is prolific of events, and these characters are all human\r\nbeings. They are not in the least anachronistic. They act and speak a\r\ngreat deal in the coarse fashion of the good old times. Griffith Gaunt\r\nis half tipsy when Kate plights her troth to him; and he is drunk upon\r\nan occasion not less solemn and interesting. They are of an age that was\r\nvery gallant and brutal, that wore gold-lace upon its coat, and ever so\r\nmuch profanity upon its speech; and Mr. Reade has treated them with\r\nundeniable frankness and sincerity. Mercy Vint alone seems to belong to\r\na better time; but then goodness and purity are the contemporaries of\r\nevery generation, and, besides, Mercy Vint's puritan character is an\r\nexceptional phase of the life of the time. It is admirable to see in\r\nthis fiction, as we often see in the world, how wise and refined\r\nreligion makes an ignorant and lowly-bred person. As a retrospective\r\nstudy, Griffith Gaunt cannot be placed below Henry Esmond. As a study of\r\npassions and principles that do not change with civilizations, it is\r\neven more excellent. Griffith Gaunt himself is the most perfect figure\r\nin the book, because the plot does not at any period interfere with his\r\ngrowth. We start with a knowledge of the frankness and generosity native\r\nto a somewhat coarse texture of mind, and we readily perceive why a\r\nnature so prone to love and wrath should fall a helpless prey to\r\njealousy, which is a thing altogether different from the suspicion of\r\nungenerous spirits. It is jealousy which drives Griffith to deceive\r\nMercy Vint, for even his desolation and his need of her consoling care\r\ncannot bring him to it, and it is only when his triumphing rival appears\r\nthat this frank and kindly soul consents to enact a cruel lie. The crime\r\ncommitted, there is no longer virtue or courage in the man, and we see\r\nwithout surprise his cowardly reluctance to do the one brave and noble\r\nthing possible to him, lest he be arrested for bigamy. The letter, so\r\nweak and so boisterous, which he gives Mercy Vint to prove him alive\r\nbefore the court, is in keeping with the development of his character;\r\nand it is not unnatural that he should think the literal gift of his\r\nblood to his wife a sort of compensation and penance for his sins\r\nagainst her. The wonder is that the author should fall into the same\r\nerror, as he seems to do.\r\n\r\nThe character of Kate Gaunt is treated in the _dénouement_ with a\r\nviolence which almost destroys its identity, but throughout the whole\r\nprevious progress of the story it is a most artistic and consistent\r\ncreation. From the beautiful girl, so virginal and dreamy and insecure\r\nof her destiny in the world, with her high aspirations and her high\r\ntemper, there is a certain lapse to the handsome matron united with a\r\nman beneath her in mind and spirit, and assured of the commonplace fact\r\nthat in her love and duty to him is her happiness; but as Love must\r\noften mate men and women unequally, it is perfectly natural that Love in\r\nher case should strive to keep his eyes shut when no longer blind. Great\r\nexigencies afterwards develop her character, and it gains in dignity and\r\nbeauty from her misfortunes, and we do not again think compassionately\r\nof her till she is reunited with Griffith. In spite of all her faults,\r\nshe is wonderfully charming. The reader himself falls in love with her,\r\nand perhaps a subtile sense of jealousy and personal loss mingles with\r\nhis dissatisfaction in seeing her given up again to her unworthy\r\nhusband. She should have been left a lovely and stately widow, to whom\r\nwe could all have paid our court, without suffering too poignantly when\r\nSir George Neville finally won her.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Evangeline, a Tale of Acadie._ By HENRY W. LONGFELLOW. With\r\nIllustrations by F.O.C. Darley. Boston: Ticknor and Fields.\r\n\r\n_Maud Muller._ By JOHN G. WHITTIER. With Illustrations by W.J.\r\nHennessy. Boston: Ticknor and Fields.\r\n\r\n_The Vision of Sir Launfal._ By JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL. With\r\nIllustrations by S. Eytinge, Jr. Boston: Ticknor and Fields.\r\n\r\n_Flower-de-Luce._ By HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW. With\r\nIllustrations. Boston: Ticknor and Fields.\r\n\r\nOf these volumes three have long since taken their place in the letters\r\nof America, and in the hearts of all who know and love the purest, the\r\ntruest, and the best that poesy can offer. To them in their secure\r\nposition will now be added \"Flower-de-Luce,\"--Mr. Longfellow's latest\r\nvolume,--which, containing indeed for the most part only such lyrics as\r\nhe has already contributed for desultory publication, is yet rich with\r\nthe fruit of the deep insight, wise thought, earnest feeling, and ripe\r\nscholarship of his full maturity.\r\n\r\nBut it is not our purpose to pause in criticism over works that may\r\nfairly be said to have passed beyond the province of contemporary\r\ncriticism. Rather is it our desire to welcome them as they are tendered\r\nto us in a new form, and to commend the artistic character of their\r\npresentation. For these books indicate that out of the many attempts\r\nwhich have been made in this country--some of them most creditable, too,\r\nand nearly approaching thorough excellence--to produce illustrative and\r\nmechanical effects equal to those of England and continental Europe,\r\nthere has at last come an absolute accomplishment, from which we hope\r\nand are ready to believe there will be no recession.\r\n\r\nOne book of great beauty would hardly raise our faith so far. It might\r\nbe the result of a fortunate combination of propitious circumstances, an\r\naccident of which the best intent in the world could not cause a\r\ndeliberate repetition,--for chance can work well as easily as ill, may\r\nmake a plan as simply as mar it, and none need be told how often the\r\nbest-devised schemes \"gang a-gley\" by reason of some fortuity for which\r\nno allowance had been made.\r\n\r\nBut when from the same press there emanate in a single season several\r\nbooks, prepared at different times by different hands, although, of\r\ncourse, under the same general direction and supervision, the natural\r\ninference is, that something positive has been attained, either in the\r\nprinciple of manufacture, or in a better understanding of the elements\r\nwhich must enter into the composition of a really elegant book, and a\r\njuster estimate of the manner in which these elements are to be\r\ncombined.\r\n\r\nIn the four books under consideration, all the necessary conditions\r\nappear to have been recognized and fulfilled. It is, of course, too much\r\nto say that they are perfect, and many who are versed in the particulars\r\nof lineal art will perhaps find things which they might wish otherwise.\r\nBut with all such qualification, these volumes show indisputably that in\r\nthe matter of illustration and typography the New World is now quite the\r\nequal of the Old.\r\n\r\nThe artists engaged--to whose names, as mentioned above, should be added\r\nthose of H. Fenn, G. Perkins, S. Colman, Jr., and W. Waud, as\r\nillustrators of \"Flower-de-Luce\"--are all men well known, and most of\r\nthem are eminent in their profession. Each has had a subject which\r\nsuited closely his capacity and taste, together, evidently, with the\r\nliberty of treating his theme according to his own discretion, and as\r\namply as he pleased,--the brief poem, \"Maud Muller,\" for instance,\r\nhaving been supplied by Mr. Hennessy with thirteen illustrations, while\r\nin the other volumes equal liberality is manifest.\r\n\r\nWe have not the space to make, as we should like to do, an exact\r\nanalysis of these volumes, comparing each artist's series of drawings,\r\none by one, with his chosen passages of the text; but a careful\r\nexamination convinces us that as a whole these designs are remarkably\r\nappreciative and apt. Every person will not expect his own ideal\r\nEvangeline or Sir Launfal to appear before him on the page, but every\r\nreflective mind will find, we think, such a parallelism between poetry\r\nand picture as is not only consistent with exactness, but will further\r\nserve to illuminate and beautify the text.\r\n\r\nIntelligent or even inspired drawing is vain, if to it be not added\r\nfaithfulness and fervor on the part of those whose handiwork follows\r\nthat of the draughtsman, and upon whom his fate and fame greatly\r\ndepend,--the engraver and the printer. Heretofore it has seemed almost\r\nimpossible for American representatives of these three arts to work\r\ntogether for good. The drawing might be faultless as it lay intact upon\r\nthe wood, but the graver in a heedless hand or the manipulation of an\r\ninjudicious pressman left little except the broad, indestructible\r\ncharacteristics in the impression which was eventually made public.\r\n\r\nAt last, let us be thankful, a new era has dawned, and we have here\r\nwoodcuts which may confidently invite comparison with any as examples of\r\nthe highest excellence which has yet been reached in this department.\r\nThe thorough and intelligent workmanship of the University Press has\r\npreserved to us every line and shade which was intrusted to its care,\r\nand the prints are free alike from _fade_ indistinctness and from\r\nruinous weight of color. The engraving which is so admirably represented\r\nis thoroughly good, and, to our thinking, it is of a better school than\r\nthat which largely obtains in England at this time, and the degeneracy\r\nand slovenliness of which have been of late so much criticised and\r\ndeplored by the best judges. The most of the designs have been engraved\r\nby Mr. A.V.S. Anthony, who ranks probably at the head of American\r\nengravers, and whose delicacy of feeling and touch, beautifully\r\nexemplified in the eighth and twelfth pictures of \"Maud Muller,\" entitle\r\nmuch of his work to an estimation not far below that accorded to Linton\r\nor Thompson. The few remaining blocks were cut by Mr. J.P. Davis and Mr.\r\nHenry Marsh, who emulate most praiseworthily the excellence, skill, and\r\nfidelity of Mr. Anthony.\r\n\r\n\r\n_An American Family in Germany._ By J. ROSS BROWNE. New York:\r\nHarper & Brothers.\r\n\r\nIf the author of this amusing book had been less devoted to his purpose\r\nof making fun, we think he could have made us a picture of German life\r\nwhich we should have been very glad to have in the absence of much\r\nhonest information on the subject and the presence of a great deal of\r\nflimsy idealizing. As it is, we fear that his work, for the most part a\r\ntruthful portraiture, will present itself only as a caricature to those\r\nunacquainted with the original, and that, for all Mr. Browne says to the\r\ncontrary, many worthy people must go on thinking German life a romantic,\r\nChristmas-tree affair, full of pretty amenity, and tender ballads, and\r\nbon-bons. But some day, the truth will avenge itself, and without the\r\nleast air of burlesque show us that often narrow and sordid existence,\r\nabounding in sensual appetites, coarse or childish pleasures, and paltry\r\naims, and varnished with a weak and extravagant sentimentality,--that\r\nsocial order still so feudally aristocratic and feudally plebeian, in\r\nwhich the poor are little better than vassals, and their women toil in\r\nthe fields like beasts of burden, and the women of all classes are\r\ntreated with rude and clumsy disesteem.\r\n\r\nMr. Browne's book is devotedly funny, as we hinted, but, in spite of\r\nthis, is really very amusing. A Californian, rich from the _subiti\r\nguadagni_ of his shares in the Washoe mines, is carried to Frankfort by\r\nhis enthusiastic wife, who is persuaded that Germany is the proper place\r\nto bring up American children. They live there in the German\r\nfashion,--Mrs. Butterfield charmed and emulous of German civilization,\r\nMr. Butterfield willing, but incorrigibly Californian to the last, and\r\nretaining throughout that amazing local pride in the institutions,\r\nproductions, and scenery of his adopted State which Americans so swiftly\r\nacquire in drifting from one section of the Union to another. The\r\ninvention of this family is not the least truthful thing in the book,\r\nwhich in many respects is full of droll good-sense and good humor.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Charles Lamb. A Memoir._ By BARRY CORNWALL. Boston: Roberts\r\nBrothers.\r\n\r\nIt is not to any very definable cause that this charming book owes the\r\ninterest with which it holds the reader throughout. It can scarcely be\r\nsaid to present the life or character of Lamb in a novel aspect, and\r\neven the anecdotic material in which it abounds does not appear\r\naltogether fresh. The very manner in which the subject is treated is\r\nthat to which we are accustomed: for who has ever been able to write of\r\nCharles Lamb but in a tone of tender and compassionate admiration?\r\n\r\nSomething, however, better than novelty of matter or method appears in\r\nthis Memoir, and makes it the best ever written concerning the fine\r\npoet, exquisite humorist, and noble man, who it brings nearer than ever\r\nto our hearts. Much was to be expected of Mr. Proctor in such a work,\r\nthough much would have been forgiven him if he had indulged himself far\r\nmore than he has done in an old man's privilege to be garrulous upon old\r\ntimes and old friends, and had confined himself less strictly to the\r\nlife and character illustrative of Lamb's. As it is, there is nothing\r\nconcerning any of Lamb's contemporaries that we would willingly lose\r\nfrom this book. In these sketches of the humorist's friends the subtile\r\nand delightful touches bring out his own nature more clearly, and he\r\nappears in the people who surrounded him hardly less than in his essays\r\nor the events of his career; while Mr. Proctor's long acquaintance with\r\nLamb becomes the setting to a more careful picture than we have yet had\r\nof his singularly great and unselfish life; and we behold, not a study\r\nof the man in this or that mood only, but a portrait in which his whole\r\ncharacter is seen. The sweetest and gentlest of hosts, moving among his\r\nguests and charming all hearers with his stammered, inimitable\r\npleasantry; the clerk at his desk at the India House, and finally\r\nreleased from it into a life of illimitable leisure; the quaint little\r\nscholar of Christ's Hospital; the quaint old humorist taking his long\r\nwalks about his beloved London; the author, known and endeared by his\r\nbooks; the careworn and devoted man, hurrying through the streets with\r\nhis maniac sister on his arm, to place her in the shelter of a\r\nmad-house,--it is not some one of these alone, but all of these\r\ntogether, that we remember, after the perusal of this Memoir, so\r\ngraceful in manner, so simple in style, and so thoroughly beautiful and\r\nunaffected in spirit. There is no story from which the reader can turn\r\nwith a higher sense of another's greatness and goodness, or an humbler\r\nsense of his own.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Character and Characteristic Men._ By EDWIN P. WHIFFLE.\r\nBoston: Ticknor and Fields.\r\n\r\nIf we should say this is a book that brings its author under its title,\r\nand that he is in every page of it to the unconscious subject of his own\r\npen, we might sufficiently express our sense of its reality and vital\r\nstrength. But no self-introduction could be more modest or undesigned.\r\nWe know of no volume in which vigor walks with less attendance of\r\nvanity, or less motion of covert egotism in the stalwart stride; yet the\r\n_style_, which proverbially is the _man_, does not lack decisive stamp,\r\nbut is too peculiar to be confounded with any other. It is not flaming,\r\nor flowing, or architectural. It is not built, but wrought, with blows\r\nof the hammer. We should emphasize the writer's historic taste, but that\r\nhis learning is so at the service of his philosophy that it never\r\nburdens, but only arms. There is a tough welding of principle with fact,\r\nand fetching of opposite poles together in the constant circulation\r\nbetwixt ideas and events. Sometimes an excess of antithesis shows a\r\nlittle too much the wrinkled brow of thought, striving to put more into\r\na sentence than it will fairly carry, and corrugating the elsewhere\r\nsmoother lines,--as in a hilly country there was said to be too much\r\nsoil to be evenly disposed of, and so part of it had to be pushed up\r\ninto the sky. But this roughness is better than thinness; and in Mr.\r\nWhipple's book there are passages of swift, grand eloquence, and of\r\nintense peace and depth. Wit and humor, native to our author, with no\r\nmalignity or pride for an ally, combine with sentiment and reflection,\r\nand his talent is never wrapped up in a merely elegant phrase, but in\r\nplain and homely words is the delivery of his sense. We would cite, in\r\nproof of the justness of our criticism, such essays as those on\r\n\"Character,\" \"Intellectual Character,\" and \"Washington and the\r\nPrinciples of the Revolution.\" Those on Thackeray and Nathaniel\r\nHawthorne show, with appreciative praise, the literary doctor's fatal\r\nfeeling of the patient's pulse. The courtesy of Everett is gracefully\r\nowned; and there is a fine glimpse of that face of Thomas Starr King,\r\nwhich did not seem so much to mirror the sun as to make the sunbeam a\r\nshadow of itself; while a just tribute is paid to the original and\r\ncourageous genius and research of our great enthusiast and naturalist,\r\nAgassiz. But this is a book to be mastered only by a thorough perusal,\r\nand no hasty diagonal glance along the leaves can render justice to it.\r\nWhile deserving attention for its general merits of intelligence,\r\nmorality, humanity, and a spiritual faith, which no eye of friendship is\r\nneeded to discern, in the judiciary department of letters it has an\r\nunrivalled claim. For faculty of pure criticism we know not Mr.\r\nWhipple's equal. The judgment-seat shines in his eye. We seem to be\r\nhearing all the time the kindly sentence of an infallible sight. We\r\nshould be afraid of the decree which such knowledge, intuition,\r\nimagination, and logic combine to pronounce, but that no grudge\r\nprovokes, or bribe can ever bias the court; and, while its just\r\nconscience cannot acquit hollow pretensions, over its own decisions\r\npreside an absolute purity and the loftiest ideal of human life.",
