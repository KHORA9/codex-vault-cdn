H.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               PREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this volume the story is told of the first _entente cordiale_ and\r\nof the circumstances which led to its disruption. The questions which\r\noccupied the attention of the French and the British governments at\r\nthat period have now passed into the domain of history. The resentment\r\nevoked by the Egyptian crisis of 1840 and the controversies raised by\r\nthe Spanish marriages has died away. The attitude towards the Liberal\r\nand national movements in Europe, adopted, on the one side, by Louis\r\nPhilippe and M. Guizot and, on the other, by Lord Palmerston, can, at\r\nthis distance of time, be reviewed dispassionately. In the light of\r\nthe knowledge of to-day, the difficulties which beset the \"Citizen\r\nKing\" may be estimated, and the injustice of many of the attacks made\r\nupon the policy of Palmerston can be demonstrated.\r\n\r\nResearches in the diplomatic correspondence of the period, both in\r\nLondon and in Paris, have enabled me to place in print, for the first\r\ntime, many documents bearing upon the part played by Talleyrand in\r\nthe Belgian question and upon the secret policy of Louis Philippe\r\nin the same affair. In these pages some new light has, I venture to\r\nthink, been thrown upon the situation in Spain during the regencies\r\nof Christina and Espartero, and during the early years of the\r\nrule of Isabella. In connection, also, with Palmerston's Eastern\r\npolicy, certain facts, hitherto unpublished, are now presented for\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nDuring the eighteen years covered by this volume the Whigs were, for\r\nthe greater part of the time, in office. Amidst the Russells, the\r\nGreys, the Spencers and the other powerful Whig families Palmerston\r\nwas an interloper. Nor was he ever a Whig. In external affairs he\r\nremained always a _Canningite_. Some of the worst miscalculations of\r\nLouis Philippe and his ministers were due to their inability to grasp\r\nthe fact that the foreign policy of the Whigs was in the hands of\r\nthe most \"un-Whiggish\" of statesmen. The period was one of political\r\nunrest, the precursor of great wars and revolutions. France was\r\ndisenchanted and profoundly dissatisfied with her \"Citizen King.\" In\r\nGermany and Italy Metternich still maintained his system, but there\r\nwere symptoms that the end of his long rule was fast approaching. In\r\nSpain the transition from autocracy to constitutionalism coincided\r\nwith a fiercely disputed succession to the throne. Turkey, in the\r\nwords of Nicholas, was \"the sick man of Europe.\"\r\n\r\n                                                                 J.

But the real character of the\r\nmovement which brought about the downfall of the elder branch of the\r\nBourbons was, at the time, very imperfectly understood. It was not a\r\ndetermination to preserve at all costs the parliamentary system which\r\nanimated the combatants in the \"glorious days of July.\" \"Long live the\r\nCharter\" was the watchword of the peaceful _bourgeois_. \"Down with the\r\nBourbons\" was the war cry of the men of the barricades.\r\n\r\nOutside the limited circle of the old Royalist families the restored\r\nmonarchy had never been popular. Yet it was unquestionably the best\r\nand freest form of government which the country had ever enjoyed. The\r\nreason of the unpopularity of the Bourbons lay in the circumstances\r\nwhich had attended their return to France. By the large majority\r\nof Frenchmen their restoration was deeply resented, as one of the\r\nhumiliating conditions imposed upon their country by the allied\r\nsovereigns, after Waterloo.\r\n\r\nIn respect to her frontiers, France in 1815 had been replaced in\r\nthe position which she had occupied in 1789. Seeing the expenditure\r\nof blood and treasure which her wars had entailed upon Europe,\r\nthese terms cannot be regarded as onerous. Nevertheless, it is not\r\nsurprising that the treaties of 1815 should have been extremely\r\ndistasteful to her. They were conceived in a spirit of suspicion and\r\nwere directed mainly towards securing Europe from a fresh outbreak of\r\nher aggressiveness. Nor were the barriers, by which it was hoped to\r\nconfine her within her boundaries, the only cause of her irritation.\r\nHer vanity and love of military glory had been dangerously stimulated\r\nby the Republican and Imperial wars, and it was a bitter blow to find\r\nthat, in the final settlement, France, alone of all the great Powers,\r\nwas to acquire no increase of territory. Vexation at these conditions\r\nwas not confined to Republicans and Bonapartists. Hatred for the\r\ntreaties of 1815 was the one political sentiment which Liberals and\r\nRoyalists possessed in common.\r\n\r\nIn 1830, there was no Bonapartist party, but a strong Bonapartist\r\nspirit existed throughout the country. Veneration for the memory\r\nof \"the man\"[1] constituted the whole political philosophy of many\r\nthousands of Frenchmen. It was to the Bonapartist element that the\r\nLiberal party owed its chief strength and influence. Notwithstanding\r\nthat the Liberals had opposed the Emperor during the Hundred Days,\r\nand had insisted upon his abdication after Waterloo, their alliance\r\nwith the Bonapartists was cemented in the early days of the second\r\nRestoration. A common hatred of the Bourbons was the bond of union\r\nbetween them. In the Masonic and _Carbonari_ lodges the bolder spirits\r\nof the two parties plotted together against the monarchy. When the\r\nreigning dynasty should have been overthrown, the conspirators\r\nproposed to proclaim the sovereignty of the people and to declare\r\nonce more the tricolour the national flag. Then, and not till then,\r\ncould France regain her \"natural frontiers.\"[2] It was the practice of\r\nthese military democrats invariably to assert that the Bourbons were\r\nresponsible for all the misfortunes of 1814 and 1815. They believed,\r\nor professed to believe, that the loss of territory, which France had\r\nsustained, was the price which the Bourbons had agreed to pay for\r\ntheir restoration. So long as a Bourbon was upon the throne Waterloo\r\nmust go unavenged and France must submit to be deprived of her natural\r\nboundaries. It was this spirit which had animated the combatants in\r\nthe Revolution of July. Men who understood and cared nothing for\r\nconstitutional questions took up arms, believing that a victory over\r\nCharles' guards would be a first defeat inflicted upon the allied\r\nsovereigns, and that a successful invasion of the Tuileries would be\r\nfollowed by a great national war upon the Rhine.[3]\r\n\r\nThe enthronement of the Duc d'Orléans was the strange termination of a\r\nrevolution, carried out mainly by men who were animated by sentiments\r\nsuch as these. Even on the evening of the third day's fighting, when\r\nthe Royal troops had been driven from Paris and when the people were\r\nin possession of the Tuileries, the Duke's name was still unmentioned.\r\nMost of the Liberal deputies were disposed to make their peace with\r\ntheir lawful king, and to be satisfied with the withdrawal of the\r\nunconstitutional ordinances and with the dismissal of the Prince de\r\nPolignac and his colleagues in the government. The extreme party,\r\nthe old soldiers, the members of the former _Carbonari_ lodges, the\r\nstudents of the _polytechnique_, the men who had borne the burden\r\nof the struggle, were not prepared with an immediate solution of the\r\nquestion. Beyond declaring that they would take up arms again, rather\r\nthan accept any concessions at the hands of Charles X. or the Dauphin,\r\nthey had no definite plan to bring forward. Louis Philippe was to owe\r\nhis crown to a skilfully worded placard, the work of Laffitte the\r\nLiberal banker, and of Thiers, a clever young journalist, which on the\r\nfollowing morning, greeted the Parisians at every street corner. In\r\nthis proclamation the enthronement of the Duc d'Orléans was held up\r\nas the one solution which would restore public order without further\r\nbloodshed. A republic, it was declared, would entail both internal\r\nstrife and war abroad, whilst Charles X., the monarch who had shed\r\nthe blood of the people, must be adjudged unworthy to retain his\r\ncrown. The Duc d'Orléans, on the other hand, was a prince devoted to\r\nthe cause of the Revolution, who had never borne arms against his own\r\ncountrymen, but who, on the contrary, had worn the tricolour at Valmy\r\nand at Jemappes. Let the people call for him and the Duke would come\r\nforward, content to accept the Charter and his crown from their hands.\r\n\r\nThe prospect of concluding the revolution in this fashion was eagerly\r\nadopted by the Liberal deputies and by the middle classes generally.\r\nBut the more turbulent members of the so-called Hotel de Ville\r\nparty indignantly repudiated the notion of allowing their glorious\r\nachievements to culminate in the enthronement of \"another Bourbon.\"\r\nThe allusions in Laffitte's and Thiers' placard to the tricolour, to\r\nValmy, and to the crown as the free gift of the people, left them\r\ncold. Nor were they to be mollified by a second proclamation, in which\r\nit was boldly asserted that the Duc d'Orléans was a Valois, not\r\na Bourbon.[4] No sooner was the Duke put forward as a candidate for\r\nthe throne, than the demagogues began to exhort the people to call\r\nupon La Fayette to assume the presidency of the republic. The old man\r\nwas, as he had been forty years before, in command of the national\r\nguards, and was once more the hero of the mob. He was, however, little\r\ndisposed to undertake the responsibility which his ultra-democratic\r\nfriends wished him to assume. Under these circumstances, Rémusat and\r\nother of his colleagues in the Chamber, assisted, it is said, by Mr.\r\nRives, the American minister, had little difficulty in persuading him\r\nthat, were he to play the leading part in founding a Liberal monarchy,\r\nit would be accounted, throughout the Old and the New World, the most\r\nhonourable act of his declining years. Accordingly, on the following\r\nday, July 31, 1830, he agreed to receive the Duc d'Orléans, the\r\nLieutenant-General of the Kingdom, at the Hotel de Ville. Upon his\r\narrival he led him to the window and, placing the tricolour in his\r\nhands, embraced him warmly before the dense crowd upon the Place de\r\nGrève. When this ceremony had been completed the elect of the people\r\nrode back in triumph to the Palais Royal, exchanging enthusiastic\r\nhandgrips with citizens along the road. For the moment, even the most\r\ntruculent democrats were willing to accept La Fayette's assurance that\r\nin an Orleans monarchy they had found \"the best of republics.\" Ten\r\ndays later, on August 9, 1830, the Duke having sworn fidelity to the\r\nCharter was formally invested with sovereign power in the Chamber of\r\nDeputies, under the title of Louis Philippe, _King of the French_.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Revolution of July Louis Philippe was in his\r\nfifty-third year. He was the son of _Egalité_, and had been educated\r\naccording to the Liberal views of his father and of Madame de Genlis.\r\nAlthough in 1794 he had deserted from the national armies along\r\nwith Dumouriez, his commander-in-chief, he could assert truthfully\r\nthat, throughout the long years of his subsequent exile, he had never\r\nturned his arms against his own country. During his wanderings in\r\nAmerica and upon the continent, he had mixed with men of all sorts\r\nand all conditions. In Switzerland, indeed, he is said to have earned\r\na livelihood by teaching in a school. In 1814 the idea of conferring\r\nthe crown upon him, rather than upon Louis XVIII., had found favour in\r\nsome quarters. But although, from this time forward, there had always\r\nexisted some kind of a party, to which the name of Orleanist might\r\nhave been applied, the Duke himself would appear to have been innocent\r\nof any participation in the proceedings of his adherents.\r\n\r\nAfter Waterloo the plan of substituting him for Louis XVIII. had\r\nan increased number of supporters. Louis, who had never liked him,\r\nbegan from this moment to treat him with great suspicion. Both in\r\nEngland, where he continued to reside in a kind of disgrace till 1817,\r\nand at the Palais Royal, after his return to France, he was beset\r\nconstantly by the spies of the police.[5] Charles X. had no share in\r\nhis brother's dislike and distrust of the Duc d'Orléans, and one of\r\nhis first acts, after his accession, was to raise him to the rank of\r\na Royal Highness. But, notwithstanding that, from the beginning of\r\nthe new reign, more cordial relations were established between the\r\nTuileries and the Palais Royal, there was never any real intimacy\r\nbetween the King and his sagacious relative. Charles was a man of\r\nlimited intelligence and a bigot in religion. Politically he had not\r\nchanged since the time when, as the Comte d'Artois, he had emigrated\r\nto Coblentz, and had called upon the Powers to assist him with men\r\nand with money to re-establish the old _régime_ in France. The Duc\r\nd'Orléans, on the other hand, was a well-informed man of the world, a\r\nLiberal, who was neither a friend nor an enemy of the clergy.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that during the whole period of the Restoration the Duc\r\nd'Orléans was at pains to impress upon the public how greatly he\r\ndiffered in all matters, both great and small, from his cousins of\r\nthe elder branch. When the return of Bonaparte from Elba compelled\r\nthe Royal family to fly once more from France, he had not joined\r\nLouis XVIII. at Ghent, but had gone to England and had resided,\r\nthroughout the Hundred Days, in complete retirement at Twickenham.\r\nMoreover, before quitting Lille he had addressed a farewell letter to\r\nthe general officers serving under him, bidding them act, after his\r\ndeparture, in whatever manner might appear to them the most calculated\r\nto promote the highest interests of their country--an injunction\r\nwhich aroused as much indignation among the \"pure Royalists\" as it\r\nelicited commendation from the majority of Frenchmen. As they grew up,\r\nhis sons, the young princes, were educated like ordinary citizens at\r\nthe _Lycée_, and at the Palais Royal a simplicity was observed which\r\ncontrasted strongly with the ceremony maintained, on all occasions,\r\nat the Court and in the apartments of the Dauphin. Nor could it fail\r\nto attract remark that men whose fidelity to the reigning dynasty was\r\ndoubtful and prominent members of the Opposition were his habitual\r\nguests.\r\n\r\nBut, although there may be some circumstances of a suspicious nature\r\nin Louis Philippe's conduct under the Restoration, it is improbable\r\nthat he ever seriously harboured any thoughts of usurping the crown.\r\nHis general behaviour is capable of a different explanation. He had\r\ntasted the bitterness of poverty, and appears to have been haunted\r\nconstantly by the dread that his children might, some day, be reduced\r\nto the straits under which he had suffered in the early years of\r\nhis exile. He was too clear-sighted a man not to perceive that the\r\nrestored monarchy had no place in the affections of the people, and\r\nthat the first serious mistake on Charles' part would be the signal\r\nfor his overthrow. It became, therefore, his policy to dissociate\r\nhimself, as far as possible, from the Court in the hope that, should\r\nthe Bourbons be expelled, he might escape from the necessity of\r\nsharing in their misfortunes. It is scarcely doubtful that the true\r\nmotives of his somewhat equivocal attitude, at this period, should be\r\nascribed to a keen desire to be allowed to remain in possession of his\r\ngreat estates, whatever political changes might take place, rather\r\nthan to any deep-laid schemes of personal aggrandizement.[6]\r\n\r\nAt the time of the promulgation of the famous ordinances of July the\r\nDuke was with his family at Neuilly. For the past four months he had\r\nviewed Charles' obstinate determination to retain his ministers,\r\nin defiance of the Chamber, with alarm. Nevertheless, the King's\r\n_coup d'état_ seems to have taken him completely by surprise. His\r\nchief endeavour, from the moment that it became apparent that the\r\nexecution of the ordinances would lead to serious trouble, was to\r\navoid committing himself with either party. Between Monday, July 26,\r\nthe day on which the decrees were published in the _Moniteur_, and\r\nFriday, July 30, when the success of the revolution was assured,\r\nhe would not appear to have had any communication with either the\r\nCourt at Saint-Cloud or the Liberal deputies in Paris. Indeed, on\r\nWednesday, July 28, when the fighting in the streets assumed a very\r\nserious character, he secretly withdrew from Neuilly and went into\r\nhiding at Le Raincy, another of his residences near Paris. Thiers, in\r\nconsequence, when he visited Neuilly on Friday morning, was unable to\r\nsee him, and it was only at last, after repeated messages had been\r\nsent him by Laffitte and other supporters, that he ventured to emerge\r\nfrom his retreat and to return secretly, and in the dead of night,\r\nto the Palais Royal. It is said that in arriving at this decision he\r\nwas greatly influenced by his sister, henceforward to be generally\r\nknown as Madame Adelaïde, to whose opinion in political matters he\r\nwas accustomed to attach greater weight than to that of his wife, the\r\nsweet-natured and dignified Marie Amélie.\r\n\r\nAfter a few hours in Paris any doubts and hesitations with which he\r\nmay have been beset vanished completely. The old King was in full\r\nflight from Saint Cloud, his guards even were demoralized and were\r\ndeserting him. From country towns came the news that the tricolour had\r\nbeen hoisted, amidst the greatest enthusiasm, and that the revolution\r\nwas spreading rapidly. When, on that Saturday afternoon, the Duc\r\nd'Orléans mounted his horse to meet La Fayette at the Hotel de Ville,\r\nhe was fully determined to seize the crown, which his unfortunate\r\nkinsman had let fall into the gutter.\r\n\r\nLegitimist historians and others, professing to write in a more\r\nimpartial spirit, have commented most adversely upon his conduct in\r\nthis, the supreme crisis of his eventful life. It must, however, be\r\nadmitted by everybody who studies the question with an open mind\r\nthat France was irrevocably resolved to expel the Bourbons. It has,\r\nnevertheless, been contended that, had the Duc d'Orléans consented to\r\nundertake the regency, no serious objections would have been made to\r\nthe enthronement of the Duc de Bordeaux,[7] in whose favour Charles\r\nand the Dauphin had abdicated on August 2. Unfortunately, however,\r\nit was notorious that this young prince was the pupil of the Jesuits,\r\nand the prejudice against him, on that account, was unquestionably\r\nvery strong. Without doubt, had the plan been given a trial, it must\r\nhave speedily ended in disaster. In addition to the many and great\r\ndifficulties with which Louis Philippe was confronted, during the\r\nwhole course of his reign, he must, as Regent, have been perpetually\r\nexposed to the suspicion of acting under the inspiration of the young\r\nKing's family, and that suspicion would quickly have proved fatal.\r\nThere were, therefore, but two alternatives, either a republic or\r\nan Orleans monarchy. Seeing the dispositions of the continental\r\nsovereigns and the condition of France in 1830, the proclamation of\r\na republic, if it had not entailed war, must certainly have produced\r\nanarchy and brought untold misery upon the people. On the other hand,\r\nthe statutory monarchy, at the time when it was set up, had the\r\nsupport of the best elements of the nation, and Louis Philippe, by\r\naccepting the crown, can justly claim to have preserved France from\r\nthe imminent danger of civil and foreign war.\r\n\r\nLouis Philippe was a man of more than usual courage. In his early life\r\nhe had displayed it at a critical moment upon the battlefield. In his\r\nmiddle age, in his famous progress to the Hotel de Ville, he had never\r\nhesitated to ride, without a military escort, through an armed and\r\nhostile mob. No king has probably been the object of attacks upon his\r\nlife of so determined a character as Louis Philippe. The ever-present\r\ndanger of assassination is said to have broken down the nerves of\r\nsome of the boldest of men. But, throughout his reign, the \"citizen\r\nking\" always confronted this particular peril, to which he was so\r\nconstantly exposed, with a serene and lofty courage. In the face of\r\npolitical difficulties, however, he was as timid as he was brave when\r\nit was a question of meeting physical danger. His attitude towards the\r\nJacobinical spirit, which the \"glorious days of July\" had so greatly\r\nstimulated, is characteristic of his weakness in this respect. It is\r\nnot improbable that in his heart he was secretly convinced of the\r\nultimate triumph of revolutionary principles. Be that as it may, he\r\nappears to have shrunk from attacking Jacobinism openly and boldly.\r\nHe seems to have looked upon it as a most dangerous monster which it\r\nwas advisable to coax and to humour, in the hope that, by careful\r\nhandling, it might be temporarily subjugated.[8]\r\n\r\nIn the days which intervened between La Fayette's acceptation of\r\nhim and his actual enthronement, he lost no opportunity of putting\r\nhis theory into practice. Youthful Republicans were admitted into\r\nhis presence, and he submitted to be questioned about his political\r\nprinciples.[9] It is probable that in some of these discussions he was\r\ninduced to promise far more than he afterwards found it convenient,\r\nor even possible, to perform. On many occasions afterwards he was,\r\nin consequence, reminded of a more or less mythical _Hotel de Ville\r\nProgramme_, with the conditions of which he was accused of having\r\nbroken faith. But of all the difficulties by which he was confronted\r\nin these early days, the demand for a vigorous foreign policy was\r\nby far the most serious to deal with. The convinced democrats, who\r\nhad been so bitterly opposed to his enthronement, were now the most\r\nvehement in insisting upon the adoption of a spirited course of\r\naction abroad. Without doubt, these men represented only a small\r\nminority of the nation, but, when they talked of military glory and\r\nof \"natural frontiers,\" they appealed to sentiments which a \"king\r\nof the barricades\" could not afford to disregard. It was a matter\r\nof indifference to the demagogues of the party that the flower of\r\nthe army was in Algeria, that many of the regiments at home were\r\ndemoralized by their recent collision with the people, and that France\r\nhad neither allies nor financial credit. The war for which they\r\nclamoured was to be conducted upon strictly revolutionary principles.\r\n\"Peace with the nations, war with the kings,\" the old cry was to be\r\nraised once more under cover of which, in former days, France had\r\nacquired her coveted boundaries.\r\n\r\nApart from the question as to whether the conditions of France and of\r\nEurope, in 1830, were such as to render it probable that a repetition\r\nof the methods of 1793 would be attended with success, the fact that\r\nthe first shot fired on the frontiers would be the signal for the\r\nopening of the floodgates of revolutionary propagandism, made it of\r\nvital moment to Louis Philippe to avert the outbreak of hostilities.\r\nIn a war, having for its loudly proclaimed object the destruction\r\nof kings, what hope could he have that his throne, resting upon new\r\nand untried foundations, would escape the general ruin? But although\r\nhe was resolved to use every effort to maintain the peace, it was\r\nthoroughly in accordance with his habitual practice to cajole and\r\nflatter the faction which desired war. Accordingly, in his replies\r\nto the numerous patriotic addresses which were presented to him,\r\nhe would dilate in fulsome language upon the heroic conduct of the\r\ncitizens in the recent street fighting. All his speeches and his\r\npublic utterances teemed with references to Valmy and Jemappes. When\r\nthe band struck up the _Marseillaise_, he would beat time with his\r\nfinger, \"casting ecstatic glances at the tricolor like one who has\r\nfound a long-lost mistress.\"[10] Yet, whilst he was thus appealing to\r\nthe revolutionary recollections and flattering the military vanity of\r\nthe people, all his thoughts were bent upon obtaining his recognition\r\nby the great European Courts. No sooner, therefore, was he enthroned,\r\nthan he sent off emissaries, upon whose discretion he could depend,\r\nbearing letters to his brother monarchs announcing his accession. But\r\nin these communications, intended only for the eyes of the sovereigns\r\nand their confidential advisers, he was careful to speak of the\r\n\"glorious revolution\" as a lamentable catastrophe which he sincerely\r\ndeplored.[11]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                   THE POWERS AND THE CITIZEN KING\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1830 England was still suffering acutely from the financial crisis\r\nof five years before. The losses of the capitalists entailed distress\r\nupon the working classes in the shape of unemployment and diminished\r\nwages. The misery of the people led to the commission of acts of\r\nviolence and incendiarism upon a scale unparalleled in the recent\r\nhistory of England. The advocates of parliamentary reform drew their\r\nbest arguments, in support of their cause, from the wretched condition\r\nof the country. The elections, rendered necessary by the death of\r\nGeorge IV., began in the very week which saw France in the throes of\r\nher revolution. By the Opposition the victory of the Parisians was\r\nacclaimed enthusiastically as the triumph of a neighbouring people\r\nover despotism and aristocratic privilege. The downfall of Polignac\r\nwas celebrated as a crushing blow to Wellington. The belief that the\r\nDuke had connived at, if not directly inspired, the French King's\r\nattempted _coup d'état_, was not confined to ignorant people, but was\r\nprofessed by the leaders of the Whig party.[12] Whilst this supposed\r\nconnection of Wellington with Polignac increased the voting power\r\nof the Opposition, Tory patrons of rotten boroughs, incensed at his\r\nCatholic policy, withheld from him their support. The Duke returned\r\nfrom the elections with a diminished majority, and one, moreover,\r\nwhich, such as it was, in no way represented the real opinion of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nWellington had been chiefly instrumental in effecting the restoration\r\nof the Bourbons after Waterloo. The news of their expulsion could not,\r\nunder these circumstances, fail to cause him some personal regret.\r\nBut, in addition, he was too well acquainted with French affairs not\r\nto be aware that the triumph of the democratic party was a grave\r\nmenace to the peace of Europe. On the other hand, however, far from\r\nbeing, as was supposed, upon confidential terms with Polignac, the\r\nFrench expedition to Algiers had strained seriously the official\r\nrelations which alone subsisted between them. But any reluctance,\r\nwhich he and his colleagues might have entertained, to recognizing\r\nthe new _régime_ in France, had to give way before the popular\r\nenthusiasm which the revolution called forth throughout England. The\r\nDuke, accordingly, lost no time in advising the King to acknowledge\r\nLouis Philippe. It was a policy, he maintained, which not only\r\noffered the best prospect of preserving peace, but which would meet\r\nwith the approval of all the great Powers.[13] Consequently, when\r\non August 22 General Baudrand arrived in London, bringing with him\r\na letter from Louis Philippe to William IV., he was accorded a good\r\nreception in ministerial circles. Although he fancied he could detect\r\na little coldness in Wellington's manner, his mission achieved a\r\ncomplete success. After a stay of about a week in London he returned\r\nto Paris, taking back with him King William's answer together with a\r\nbox ornamented with a portrait of that monarch set in diamonds.[14]\r\nMeanwhile, on August 18, Charles X. and the members of his family\r\nhad arrived at Spithead on board _The Great Britain_, the American\r\nvessel chartered by the French government to convey them to England.\r\nThe state of public feeling made it inadvisable that they should\r\nproceed to London or even land at Portsmouth, and they were, in\r\nconsequence, taken, a few days later, by steamer to Lulworth Castle,\r\nin Dorsetshire, which had been prepared for their reception. The\r\nmob which had cheered exultingly as Castlereagh's body was borne\r\nthrough the streets to its last resting-place at Westminster Abbey,\r\nwhich, two years later, was to threaten Wellington with violence on\r\nthe anniversary of Waterloo, would have shown scant respect for the\r\nmisfortunes of the fallen King.\r\n\r\nEver since the days of her crowning disaster at Wagram, Metternich\r\nhad directed the foreign policy of Austria. Clement Wenceslas von\r\nMetternich, Chancellor of the Court and of the State, was descended\r\nfrom a family of counts of the empire and was born at Coblentz in\r\n1773. His predecessors in office, old Kaunitz, the minister of Maria\r\nTheresa, Thugut, Cobenyl, and Stadion, had in vain attempted to cope\r\nwith republican and imperial France. Without doubt, Metternich in\r\nthe final struggle with Bonaparte was assisted by circumstances not\r\nof his own creation, nevertheless he unquestionably proved himself,\r\non many occasions, a crafty, wary adversary, who could await his\r\nopportunity patiently. The flattery which was lavished upon him at the\r\npeace and the prominent part which he was enabled to play in the great\r\nterritorial settlement at Vienna stimulated greatly his natural vanity\r\nand presumption. In addition, as he grew older, he began to indulge\r\nmore and more in long philosophical disquisitions upon every kind of\r\npolitical subject. But under his pedantic manner, he retained always\r\nhis alert resourcefulness and shrewd common sense. In the words of\r\nSir Frederick Lamb, who had transacted much business with him, \"he was\r\nfar too practical a man to regulate his conduct by his doctrines, and\r\nfar too ingenious a one to be at a loss for a doctrine to cover his\r\nconduct.\"[15]\r\n\r\nWithout doubt, Metternich was a man of aristocratic and conservative\r\ninstincts, but, had he been differently disposed, the conditions\r\nof the Empire must have rendered very difficult the adoption of a\r\nLiberal policy. At the Congress of Vienna Austria had renounced all\r\nclaim to her former possessions in the Low Countries and in Western\r\nGermany, and had withdrawn to the south and south-east to exercise an\r\nuneasy dominion over Slavs and Italians. Progress on national lines\r\nwas hardly possible in an empire thus constituted, and circumstances\r\ncontributed to facilitate the imposition of a strictly conservative\r\nsystem. The Liberal impulse, to which the War of Liberation had given\r\nbirth in Prussia, had no counterpart in Austria, nor had Francis\r\nII., like Frederick William III., even in his darkest days, promised\r\nconstitutional reforms. At the peace, accordingly, Austria reverted\r\nuncomplainingly to her old absolutist traditions.\r\n\r\nIn Italy Bonaparte had encouraged deliberately a spirit of\r\nnationality. But the patriotic hopes, which he had raised, were\r\nextinguished at the Congress of Vienna. Italy, Metternich decreed,\r\nwas to be henceforward merely \"a geographical expression.\" By the\r\nsettlement of 1815 Austria acquired actually the provinces of Lombardy\r\nand Venetia, but her influence extended far beyond these districts.\r\nAustrian princes ruled over the Duchies of Tuscany, Modena and Parma.\r\nTreaties which provided that Piacenza, Commachio and Ferrara should\r\nbe garrisoned by Austrian troops gave her military control of the\r\nvalley of the Po. Tuscany was forbidden to make either peace or war\r\nwithout her consent, and the King of Naples was pledged to introduce\r\nno constitutional changes, other than those sanctioned in the Austrian\r\ndominions.\r\n\r\nIn the Lombardo-Venetian Kingdom, as it was termed, it was\r\nMetternich's policy to make the Lombards \"forget that they were\r\nItalians.\" The Austrian code of laws was introduced without regard\r\nto native customs and prejudices. The civil service was composed\r\nalmost exclusively of Germans, and the most trifling administrative\r\nquestions had to be referred to Vienna.[16] The stagnation engendered\r\nby this system could not fail to have a demoralizing effect. At Venice\r\ntwo-fifths of the population were in receipt of charitable relief,\r\nthe middle classes were without enterprise, the aristocracy fawned\r\nupon the Austrians. On the other hand, in Lombardy and Venetia there\r\nwere few monks and a comparatively good system of popular education\r\nexisted. The people, moreover, enjoyed equality before the law which,\r\nexcept in political cases, was justly administered. But as in all\r\nItalian States, the police were arbitrary and interfering and the\r\ncensorship of the press was enforced rigidly.\r\n\r\nThe heterogeneous composition of the Austrian Empire, which demanded\r\na strictly conservative policy at home, prescribed no less urgently\r\nthe preservation of peaceful relations abroad. Since the conclusion\r\nof the great war Metternich's foreign policy had had no other object\r\nthan the maintenance of the _status quo_, by the strict observation\r\nof existing treaties. The revolutionary spirit was the most serious\r\ndanger to the settlement of 1815. Bonaparte might be dead or a\r\nprisoner at St. Helena, but Metternich was under no illusion that\r\nthe peril had passed away for ever. The revolutionary monster still\r\nsurvived and required ceaseless watching. Only, he conceived, by a\r\nEuropean Confederation, ruled over by a council of the Great Powers,\r\ncould complete security be obtained against the common enemy of all\r\nestablished governments. Metternich's combination of the Powers \"for\r\nthe maintenance of everything lawfully existing,\"[17] which has\r\nbeen held up to execration under the name of the Holy Alliance, was\r\nan adaptation to practical politics of the fantastic scheme, which\r\nAlexander had propounded, on September 26, 1815, after a review of\r\nhis army on the plain of Vertus. According to the Tsar's manifesto\r\nthe relations of all European sovereigns were in the future to be\r\nguided by the teachings of Christ. They were to regard each other\r\nin the light of brothers and to look upon their subjects as their\r\nchildren. The policy of Metternich's Holy Alliance was set forth in\r\nthe famous preliminary protocol of the conference of Troppau, signed,\r\non November 19, 1820, by the plenipotentiaries of Austria, Russia, and\r\nPrussia. \"States,\" it was laid down, \"which have undergone a change\r\nof government due to a revolution, the results of which affect other\r\nStates, shall cease to be members of the European Alliance. If owing\r\nto these alterations immediate danger threaten neighbouring States,\r\nthe Powers bind themselves to bring back by force of arms the erring\r\nState into the folds of the Alliance.\"\r\n\r\nActing upon this principle, Austria, in 1821, invaded the Kingdom\r\nof Naples and abolished the constitution which the _Carbonari_ had\r\ncompelled Ferdinand to accept, whilst Bubna, the Austrian general\r\ncommanding at Milan, entered Piedmont and suppressed the revolution\r\nwhich had broken out at Turin. The Tsar, Alexander, during these\r\noperations, held an army upon the Galician frontier ready to march\r\ninto Italy, should his assistance be invoked. The same policy, in\r\n1823, dictated the French armed intervention in Spain, when the\r\nconstitution, which the Liberals had proclaimed three years before,\r\nwas abolished and the absolute rule of King Ferdinand VII. was\r\nrestored. But the determination of England \"to abstain rigidly from\r\ninterference in the affairs of other States\" deprived the alliance of\r\nthat appearance of complete unanimity which Metternich hoped would\r\nconvince the peoples of the futility of attempting revolutions. The\r\nGreek insurrection, the quarrel between Russia and the Porte and the\r\nconflict of national interests to which the Eastern question gave\r\nrise, completed the work of disruption which Castlereagh and Canning\r\nhad begun.\r\n\r\nMetternich received the news of the revolution in Paris and of\r\nthe downfall of Charles X. at Koenigswart, his country seat in\r\nBohemia. Ever since the termination of the Russo-Turkish war he had\r\nbeen striving to re-establish the concert of the Powers and, more\r\nespecially, to place the relations of Austria and Russia upon their\r\nformer friendly footing. Deeply as Austria was interested in all\r\ndevelopments affecting the integrity of Turkey, greatly as Metternich\r\nmistrusted Nicholas' designs upon the Porte, the spread of Liberalism\r\nconstituted in his eyes an even graver danger. The Russian government\r\nwas intensely conservative and the people were little likely to be\r\naffected by the revolutionary spirit of Western Europe. Were a serious\r\ncrisis to arise it was essential that Austria should be in a position\r\nto look to St. Petersburg for support. A visit which Nesselrode, the\r\nRussian Chancellor, paid to Carlsbad, in the summer of 1830, afforded\r\nMetternich an opportunity of sounding him as to the views of his\r\nCourt, and it was upon his return from a satisfactory interview with\r\nhis old friend that he found awaiting him at Koenigswart the first\r\nintelligence of Charles X.'s violation of the constitution. On August\r\n6, when the complete triumph of the revolutionists in Paris was known\r\nto him, Metternich determined to return at once to Vienna, making\r\nanother short stay at Carlsbad upon the way. At this, their second\r\nmeeting, both statesmen affixed their signatures to a short document,\r\nwhich was to acquire a certain celebrity in the chanceries of Europe\r\nunder the name of the _chiffon de Carlsbad_. By this agreement the\r\nbasis was established of the policy which the absolute Powers were to\r\nadopt towards France. No attempt would be made to interfere with her,\r\nprovided that she should abstain from seeking to infringe existing\r\ntreaties and from disturbing the internal peace of neighbouring\r\nStates.[18]\r\n\r\nSoon after Metternich's return to Vienna, on August 26, General\r\nBelliard arrived, bringing with him a letter from Louis Philippe to\r\nthe Emperor Francis. Some days were allowed to elapse before he was\r\nadmitted to an audience, but in the interval he had two interviews\r\nwith Metternich. The Chancellor accepted his assurances that the\r\nKing of the French would do all in his power to maintain peace at\r\nhome and abroad. At the same time, however, he gave him plainly to\r\nunderstand that he had no confidence in Louis Philippe's ability to\r\ncarry out his intentions. Both the private and the official answers\r\nof the Emperor were coldly expressed, but they contained the definite\r\nassurance that he had no wish to interfere with the domestic affairs\r\nof France, in which country he sincerely desired to see tranquillity\r\nrestored. He was determined to abide by treaties, and was gratified\r\nto learn that His Majesty, the King of the French, was animated by\r\nthe same resolution. As Metternich, on September 8, placed these\r\ndocuments in Belliard's hands he took the opportunity of impressing\r\nupon him solemnly that his Imperial master, although he had decided\r\nto acknowledge the sovereignty of Louis Philippe, viewed the events\r\nwhich had taken place in France with the utmost abhorrence and was\r\nconvinced that the new _régime_ could have only a brief existence. In\r\ntruth Metternich was full of apprehensions, and, in a private letter\r\nto Nesselrode, unburdened himself of the conviction that \"the end of\r\nold Europe was fast approaching.\"[19]\r\n\r\nThe Germanic Confederation had been formed with the object of\r\nprotecting Germany from external and internal dangers. The\r\nthirty-eight States and the four free cities of which it was composed\r\nwere debarred from entering into any alliance with foreign governments\r\nagainst another member of the Confederation and, in case of need,\r\nwere pledged to furnish contingents to the federal army. Austria and\r\nPrussia, however, in order to preserve the independence of their\r\nforeign policy, brought portions only of their territories into the\r\nConfederation, which, in consequence, was not committed to the defence\r\nof Hungary, Gallicia, Lombardy and Venetia, on behalf of Austria, or\r\nto the protection of the Polish provinces of Prussia. Each State was\r\nrepresented at the federal Diet at Frankfort, which assembly was in\r\nno sense a federal parliament, but resembled rather a conference of\r\ndiplomatists, the ministers attending it being strictly bound by the\r\ninstructions furnished them by their respective Courts. Austria and\r\nPrussia had only one vote apiece, Austria, however, held the perpetual\r\npresidency.\r\n\r\nPrussia in 1815 had been regarded as the champion of Liberalism. The\r\nConstitutionalists, however, soon discovered that the hopes which\r\nthey placed in her were not destined to be realized. In the counsels\r\nof Frederick William, the influence of Wittgenstein, the leader of\r\nthe reactionary party, and the friend of Metternich, soon superseded\r\nthat of Stein, Hardenburg and the heroes of the War of Liberation. The\r\nconditions of the country, it must be admitted, were hardly suitable\r\nto the immediate establishment of representative institutions. The\r\ninhabitants of the nine provinces which, it had been decreed at the\r\nCongress of Vienna, were to constitute the Kingdom of Prussia, were\r\nnot agreed as to the form of government under which they desired\r\nto live. Until they had become Prussians, the Poles of the Duchy\r\nof Posen, the Westphaliand, the Saxons, and the Rhinelanders had\r\nexisted under different codes of law and of administration. The\r\nimposition of a uniform system upon the kingdom was a matter of urgent\r\nnecessity, and it was to administrative measures that the Prussian\r\ngovernment devoted its attention exclusively in the years which\r\nfollowed Waterloo. It is clear that there was no strong demand for a\r\nconstitution among the mass of the people, and Frederick William III.\r\ncould listen, in consequence, without much danger, to Metternich's\r\nwarning that representative institutions must prove incompatible with\r\nmilitary strength.\r\n\r\nSuccessful as he had been in persuading Frederick William to withhold\r\na constitution from Prussia, Metternich could not prevent certain\r\nrulers of the minor States from complying with Article XIII. of the\r\nFederal Act, and from establishing representative government within\r\ntheir dominions. In 1816, the Liberal Duke of Saxe-Weimar granted a\r\nconstitution, and his example was followed by the Kings of Bavaria\r\nand of Wurtemburg and the Duke of Baden. A wave of Liberalism swept\r\nover Northern Germany. The universities were affected profoundly by\r\nthe new ideas. In their lecture-rooms, professors denounced existing\r\ngovernments and harangued their pupils in the language of demagogues.\r\nThe agitation culminated, on March 23, 1819, in the murder of the\r\ndramatist and publicist Kotzebue, who was said to be in the pay of\r\nRussia, by Karl Sand, a student of Jena University and a lecturer\r\nto the _Burschenschaft_. This crime and an attempt to assassinate\r\nIbell, the minister of Nassau, gave Metternich the opportunity for\r\nwhich he had been waiting. In the month of July of this same year he\r\nhad an interview with Frederick William at Teplitz, in the course\r\nof which the King promised never to give Prussia a constitution, to\r\nplace his confidence only in ministers of the type of Bernstorff and\r\nWittgenstein, and to sanction such repressive measures as the Austrian\r\nChancellor might see fit to suggest. After a conference of the\r\nministers of the different States at Carlsbad, Metternich's decrees\r\nwere submitted to the Frankfort Diet, on September 20, 1819, and\r\nadopted forthwith.\r\n\r\nUnder the provisions of the celebrated _Carlsbad decrees_, the ruler\r\nof every German State was bound to appoint commissioners to regulate\r\nthe universities and to impose a censorship upon all newspapers and\r\nmatter printed within his dominions. Furthermore, a central tribunal\r\nwas established at Mainz to inquire into the doings of the secret\r\nsocieties, and upon the members of this court was conferred the power\r\nof arresting the subjects of any German sovereign, and of demanding\r\nfrom any law court the production of documents. These decrees,\r\nhowever, did not constitute the sum total of Metternich's measures\r\nof precaution. In November, 1819, he convened a council of German\r\nministers at Vienna, when, under the pretext of defining the functions\r\nof the Diet, sixty-five new articles of a repressive character were\r\nintroduced into the Federal Act. The general effect of the _Vienna\r\nresolutions_, as these measures were termed, was to impose upon the\r\nFederation the duty of defending absolutism by force of arms in small\r\nStates in which the sovereigns might prove incapable themselves of\r\nmaintaining a despotic form of government.\r\n\r\nMetternich's manipulation of the Diet was the great triumph of his\r\nhome policy. By converting the Federation from a combination of\r\nStates into a league of sovereigns against their own subjects, he\r\naverted the danger that it might promote the cause of Liberalism or of\r\nnational unity. From this time forward Metternich, to all appearance,\r\ndominated the Court and the Cabinet of Berlin, and held in leading\r\nstrings the minor princes of the Confederation. Nevertheless, the\r\nposition of Austria as a German Power was weakening steadily. At the\r\nCongress of Vienna he had craftily withdrawn the empire from the\r\npost of danger, and had thrust upon Prussia the task of protecting\r\nthe western flank of Germany. To his secret satisfaction, he saw her\r\npour out her treasure to defend the frontier from which Austria had\r\nrecoiled. He believed that by his _Carlsbad decrees_ and his _Vienna\r\nresolutions_ he had rendered national unity impossible, and had\r\ncondemned Northern Germany to the political stagnation in which the\r\nempire appeared contented to repose. But the enlightened bureaucratic\r\nsystem of Prussia was incomparably superior to that of Austria. In\r\neducational matters she was the foremost State in Europe, and already\r\nshe was drawing the minor States into her system of internal free\r\ntrade--the famous _Zollverein_ which was to prove so important a\r\nfactor in the struggle for Prussian hegemony and national unity. Even\r\nin 1830, acute observers could perceive that the people were stifling\r\nwithin the narrow confines of their duchies, and that, when the day\r\nof Germany's awakening should come, it would be to the Power standing\r\non guard upon the Rhine that they would look for leadership.[20] But\r\nthat hour had not yet struck, and, in the question of the attitude to\r\nbe observed towards France, after the Revolution of July, Prussia, as\r\nwas her wont, shaped her policy upon that of Austria. The Emperor's\r\nacknowledgment of Louis Philippe carried with it, accordingly,\r\nFrederick William's recognition of the King of the French.\r\n\r\nAt St. Petersburg it was not until August 19 that any mention of\r\nthe Revolution of July was allowed to appear in the newspapers. Two\r\ndays earlier a new levy of two men in five hundred had been called\r\nup for service in the army, all Russians had been ordered to leave\r\nFrance, Frenchmen had been refused admission to Russia, and any\r\ndisplay of the tricolour had been forbidden. But Lord Heytesbury,[21]\r\nthe British ambassador, was informed that this increase of military\r\nstrength had no reference to French affairs, and that the recall of\r\nRussian subjects from France was a simple measure of precaution.[22]\r\nIn the eyes of Nicholas any rising of the people against their\r\nlawful sovereign was necessarily a highly offensive proceeding, and\r\nin this instance it had the additional disadvantage of disturbing\r\na condition of affairs, the continued duration of which was very\r\nfavourable to the national policy of Russia. Under the different\r\ngovernments of the Restoration an excellent understanding had been\r\nestablished between the Courts of the Tuileries and of St. Petersburg.\r\nThe Eastern question, which had brought Russia to the verge of war\r\nwith England and which had interrupted the smooth course of her\r\nrelations with Vienna, had, on the contrary, drawn France towards\r\nher. When, in the campaign of the previous year, Constantinople had\r\nappeared to lie at the mercy of General Diebitsch, politicians as\r\nopposed as Chateaubriand and Polignac had been disposed to look upon\r\nthe situation complacently, in the hope that the disruption of the\r\nTurkish Empire might lead to a readjustment of the map of Europe,\r\nwhich might enable France to rectify in her favour the treaties of\r\n1815. Furthermore, since the intervention in Spain, in 1823, there had\r\nbeen little cordiality between the Cabinets of London and Paris. This\r\nestrangement had been intensified by the French occupation of Algiers,\r\nthe one important measure of foreign policy of the last government\r\nof the Restoration. These circumstances rendered it very improbable\r\nthat Russia in the near future would have to confront a coalition of\r\nthe maritime Powers. But now that a new _régime_ had been set up in\r\nFrance, the possibility of that dreaded contingency would have to be\r\nseriously considered.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the Tsar's military preparations, Lord Heytesbury had no\r\nfears that he proposed to attack France. Nicholas informed him that\r\nhe had directed his ambassador \"to remain in Paris, but to remove\r\nimmediately from the house furnished to the Russian embassy by the\r\ngovernment of France.\" He was constantly to hold himself in readiness\r\nto quit Paris at an hour's notice, and to leave at once, should\r\nthe English, the Prussian, the Austrian or the Dutch ambassadors\r\nbe compelled to depart. \"_En âme et en conscience_ he never would\r\nconsider the Duc d'Orléans in any light except that of a usurper.\"\r\nNevertheless he had no intention of intervening, unless France were\r\nto attempt to disseminate revolutionary doctrines in other countries\r\nor to carry her arms beyond her frontiers.[23] In due course Baron\r\nAtthalin arrived at St. Petersburg, bringing with him a letter from\r\nLouis Philippe to the Tsar, and, on September 8, was received in\r\nprivate audience by Nicholas. On this occasion the question of the\r\nacknowledgment of the King of the French was avoided, the Emperor\r\nbeing resolved to reserve the matter for further consideration. But\r\nat Tsarskoye Selo, a week later, Nicholas, whilst regretting that\r\nthe British government should have so hastily decided to recognize\r\nLouis Philippe, gave Lord Heytesbury to understand that his own\r\nacknowledgment of the King of the French would not be deferred much\r\nlonger.[24]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, an event had occurred which threatened seriously to\r\naggravate the embarrassments of the situation. The creation of the\r\nKingdom of the Netherlands occupied a most important place in the\r\nterritorial settlement following the overthrow of Bonaparte. British\r\nstatesmanship had been largely responsible for the union of Belgium\r\nwith Holland, and for the formation of a strong State of secondary\r\nrank which was to act as a barrier against France. Under Wellington's\r\nadvice the great Powers, at their own expense, erected a line of\r\nfortresses, connected with Prussian territory upon the left bank of\r\nthe Rhine, to protect the southern frontier of the new kingdom. From\r\na purely military point of view the plan may have been sound, but\r\nto propose to mould the Belgians and the Dutch into a nation was to\r\ntreat as of no account the differences of race and of religion which\r\ndivided the two peoples. The Belgians soon began to complain that\r\nthey were very inadequately represented in all branches of the public\r\nservice. Questions relating to education, taxation, and the freedom of\r\nthe press increased their discontent. The Dutch, who could look back\r\nproudly upon two centuries of independence, despised them as having\r\nbeen constantly under the dominion of a foreign Power. In 1830 it was\r\ngenerally recognized that the attempt to fuse the two peoples into one\r\nnationality had failed. The Belgians, however, still remained loyal\r\nto the House of Nassau and desired only administrative separation\r\nunder the reigning dynasty.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution of July in Paris created an immense excitement at\r\nBrussels. The town was the favourite place of refuge for the political\r\noffenders of all countries. Yet in spite of the prevailing unrest the\r\nauthorities neglected to take the most ordinary precautions against\r\na popular rising. A performance of Scribe's opera, _La Muette de\r\nPortici_, which treats of the insurrection of the Neapolitans against\r\nthe Spaniards, furnished the spark which was to cause the explosion.\r\nSerious rioting began on the night of August 25, and continued\r\nthroughout the following day. The military commander appears to have\r\nacted with a strange irresolution, and on the 28th, the insurgents\r\nbeing complete masters of the town, a deputation of notables carried\r\na respectful address to the Hague praying for the redress of their\r\ngrievances. The next three weeks were spent in fruitless attempts\r\nto arrange a compromise. The Prince of Orange, who was personally\r\npopular, visited Brussels, but his efforts to solve the question\r\nmet with no success. After the failure of his eldest son's mission\r\nthe King consented to dismiss van Maanen, the unpopular governor\r\nof Brussels. But this concession was made too late. Encouraged by\r\nemissaries of the revolutionary clubs in Paris, and emboldened by\r\nthe weakness of the government, the advocates of complete separation\r\npressed their demands with increasing violence. At last the King\r\nordered Prince Frederick of Orange to advance from the camp of\r\nVilvorde against the town. On September 23 the attack began. The\r\ntroops penetrated into the park, but failed to carry the barricades\r\nwhich obstructed the streets beyond. After three days' fighting the\r\nPrince abandoned the struggle and withdrew from the neighbourhood\r\nof Brussels. The discomfiture of his army left King William no\r\nalternative but to appeal for assistance to the Powers, whilst at\r\nBrussels a provisional government declared Belgium independent, and\r\nconvened a national congress.\r\n\r\nThis attempt on the part of a neighbouring people to imitate \"the\r\nglorious days of July\" was exceedingly gratifying to the republicans\r\nand the military democratic party in Paris. Their orators and\r\njournalists loudly declared that the revolt of the Belgians was an\r\nopportunity both for extending the French frontiers, and for effecting\r\na breach in the treaties of 1815. Louis Philippe, however, was\r\nresolved not to be drawn into an adventure of this kind. He knew that\r\nthe powers would never tolerate an invasion of the Low Countries,\r\nand he realized that the French army was in no condition to oppose a\r\nEuropean coalition. Accordingly, as it was not in his power to silence\r\nthe cries for intervention or to repress the noisy sympathy for the\r\nBelgians indulged in by a large section of the press, he determined\r\nto give to foreign governments a practical proof of his pacific\r\nintentions by despatching to London, as his ambassador, the aged\r\nstatesman who, sixteen years before, had figured so conspicuously at\r\nthe Congress of Vienna.\r\n\r\nThe Prince de Talleyrand was in his seventy-third year.\r\nNotwithstanding the great services which, in 1814, he had rendered to\r\nthe cause of Legitimate Sovereignty, the Bourbons of the elder branch\r\nhad never been able to forget his conduct under the Republic and the\r\nEmpire. At the second Restoration he had been appointed President\r\nof the Council, but had retired before the _Chambre introuvable_\r\nand the Royalist reaction, and neither Louis XVIII. nor Charles X.\r\nhad given him a second opportunity of returning to office. Upon the\r\ntriumph of the popular party in July, he had promptly placed his\r\nservices at the disposal of Louis Philippe. But, in spite of his\r\nLiberal opinions, Talleyrand retained the language, the habits, and\r\nthe appearance of a noble of the old _régime_. It might have been\r\nexpected that all the King's ingenuity would have been required to\r\nimpose so fine a gentleman upon a Cabinet, which counted among its\r\nmembers the democratic M. Dupont and the elder M. Dupin, famous for\r\nhis hobnailed boots and his affectations of middle-class simplicity.\r\nLouis Philippe's ministers, however, were agreed upon the necessity of\r\npreserving the peace, and, when it was proposed at the Council table\r\nthat Talleyrand should be sent to London, no opposition was made to\r\nthe suggestion. Guizot, who was Minister of the Interior at the time,\r\nsupposes that those who disliked the appointment must have stated\r\ntheir objections to the King in private.[25]\r\n\r\nBut if Louis Philippe and his ministers were determined to abstain\r\nfrom any intervention in Belgium, they were bound to insist that\r\nother Powers should adopt the same attitude. It was, therefore,\r\nnotified to foreign governments that French policy, in the future,\r\nwould be based strictly upon the principle of non-interference in\r\nthe domestic affairs of other nations. It was a system to which both\r\nthe great parties in England had declared their adherence, and its\r\nadoption by France might, in consequence, be expected to facilitate\r\nthe establishment of cordial relations between the two countries.\r\nBut the declaration of such a principle could not fail to be highly\r\ndispleasing to the absolute Courts. Already movements of troops were\r\nin progress in the Rhine provinces which suggested an intention on\r\nthe part of Frederick William of rendering military assistance to\r\nhis brother-in-law, the King of the Netherlands. Baron Werther, the\r\nPrussian ambassador, although still without official credentials,\r\nhad been instructed to remain in Paris. Molé, Louis Philippe's first\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, accordingly arranged to meet him at\r\na private house, where he gave him clearly to understand that the\r\nentry of a Prussian army into the Low Countries would be regarded\r\nas an act of war directed against France. This threat, which evoked\r\nmuch indignation in Berlin and at Vienna, was effectual in inducing\r\nKing Frederick William III. to renounce any thoughts, which he may\r\nhave entertained, of reducing the Belgians to submission by force of\r\narms.[26]\r\n\r\nTalleyrand arrived in London on September 24, and in a despatch,\r\nsent off the next day, expressed his satisfaction at the reception\r\naccorded him.[27] He was accompanied by the Duchesse de Dino, who\r\nofficiated as hostess at his table, and presided over his household.\r\nIn 1807, at the conclusion of the campaign in Poland, Talleyrand, then\r\nNapoleon's Minister for Foreign Affairs, had obtained for his nephew,\r\nEdmond de Périgord, the hand of Dorothée, the daughter of the last\r\nreigning Duke of Courland. After a few years of married life, however,\r\nhusband and wife agreed to live apart, and Madame Edmond from that\r\ntime forward took up her residence with Talleyrand. She accompanied\r\nhim to Vienna, in 1814, and brought back from the Congress the title\r\nof Duchesse de Dino. In return for the services he had rendered him,\r\nthe King of Naples had conferred this dukedom upon Talleyrand, who\r\nhad asked that the title might be assumed by his nephew. The duchess'\r\nposition in Talleyrand's household was so generally recognized that,\r\nupon their arrival in London, King William IV., at Wellington's\r\nrequest, allowed her to take rank as an ambassadress.[28] The Comte\r\nCasimir de Montrond, another frequent guest at Valençay, and at the\r\nhouse in the Rue Saint-Florentin, followed the ambassador to London.\r\nTalleyrand's friendship with this curious individual appears to have\r\nbegun under the Directory. In the terrible days which preceded the\r\ndownfall of Robespierre, Montrond had been an inmate of the prison\r\nof Saint-Lazare. The fortunate possession of some ready money, a\r\nrare commodity at the time, had, however, enabled him to effect his\r\nescape, and that of the citizeness Franquetot, the heretofore Aimée de\r\nCoigny, Duchesse de Fleury, the heroine of André Chénier's poem.[29]\r\nAfter this miraculous deliverance, Aimée de Coigny, who under the\r\nemigration laws had divorced the Duc de Fleury, married the man to\r\nwhom she owed her life. But, after a brief and most unsatisfactory\r\nexperience of matrimony with the gay _incroyable_, she again contrived\r\nto obtain her freedom. Montrond's introduction to London society\r\nappears to date from the year 1812, when, having incurred the grave\r\ndispleasure of Bonaparte, he succeeded in eluding the French police\r\nand in reaching England. He seems to have become very rapidly a\r\nwell-known and popular member of the fashionable world in London.\r\nDuring all this period of his life he is believed to have been totally\r\nwithout regular means of subsistence, and to have existed solely by\r\nplay, assisted by an occasional windfall in the shape of employment\r\nupon any secret political work which Talleyrand, when in favour, was\r\nenabled to procure for him. But from the earliest days of the Monarchy\r\nof July his circumstances began to improve. From this time forward he\r\nappears to have drawn a pension of about £1000 _per annum_ from the\r\nsecret service funds of the French Foreign Office.[30] This allowance\r\nis said to have been granted him in order that \"he should speak well\r\nof Louis Philippe in the London clubs.\" It was, moreover, strongly\r\nsuspected that he had obtained knowledge of certain of the King's\r\nproceedings during the emigration which His Majesty had good reasons\r\nfor wishing to keep secret.[31]\r\n\r\nThe uneasiness aroused in London by the first news of the insurrection\r\nin Brussels developed into serious alarm, when the triumph of the\r\nrevolutionists over the Royal troops became known. Wellington openly\r\ndeclared that it was a \"devilish bad business,\" and many people began\r\nto fear that a great European war was inevitable.[32] The British\r\ngovernment, whilst prepared to accept as an accomplished fact the\r\ncomplete separation of Belgium from the Kingdom of the Netherlands,\r\nheld that no changes must take place of a nature to interfere with the\r\nefficiency of the barrier fortresses, these defences \"being necessary\r\nfor the security of other States.\" After drawing up instructions to\r\nthis effect for Lord Stuart de Rothesay, Aberdeen intimated that\r\nthe government was desirous of conferring upon the situation \"in\r\nfriendly concert with France and the other Powers.\"[33] Talleyrand\r\nwas of opinion that it was a matter for congratulation that the first\r\noffer of co-operation should have come from England, and strongly\r\nrecommended that the proposal should be responded to cordially. An\r\nentirely passive attitude, he wrote, must deprive France \"of that\r\ninfluence which they are disposed to ascribe to her over here.\"[34]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in Paris, notices were appearing in the papers calling\r\nupon men to enroll themselves to assist their Belgian brothers. The\r\n_Society of the Friends of the People_ equipped a battalion which\r\nactually set out for the northern frontier. La Fayette was still\r\nthe recognized leader of the ultra-Liberals, and his house was a\r\nmeeting-place for the _Carbonari_ and the revolutionists of every\r\ncountry. But he was occupied chiefly in encouraging insurrectionary\r\nmovements in Spain and Italy. The union of Belgium with France\r\nwas advocated mainly in the ranks of the Bonapartist or military\r\ndemocratic section of the party. The protestations of Louis Philippe\r\nand Comte Molé were probably true that the government in no way\r\nfavoured their designs, and that strict orders had been given to the\r\nprefects to prevent the passage of arms into Belgium. On the other\r\nhand, however, their assertions to Lord Stuart were untrue that\r\nthey were innocent of conniving at the proceedings of the Spanish\r\nrevolutionists. Broglie and Guizot, both members of the Cabinet,\r\nadmit that in order to compel the King of Spain to acknowledge Louis\r\nPhilippe, facilities for assembling their followers upon French\r\nterritory were accorded to the Spanish insurrectionary leaders.\r\nThis rather disingenuous policy appears, without question, to have\r\ncontributed materially to the establishment of diplomatic relations\r\nbetween Paris and Madrid at the end of the month of October.[35]\r\n\r\nNone of the Powers evinced any intention of responding to the King\r\nof Holland's request for military assistance to subdue the revolted\r\nBelgians. The English proposal that a conference should be held to\r\nconsider the situation was generally regarded as the best solution of\r\nthe question. \"Austria and Prussia,\" wrote Talleyrand on October 11,\r\n\"intend to follow the lead of England with respect to Belgium, and\r\nthere can be little doubt that Russia will adopt the same course.\"[36]\r\nThe French government at this time was greatly incensed at the conduct\r\nof the Cabinet of the Hague. No official appeal for help had been\r\nsent to Paris, but in a letter to Louis Philippe the Prince of Orange\r\nopenly accused the French authorities of encouraging the disturbances\r\nin Belgium, and suggested that the King should make a public\r\ndeclaration of his intention not to meddle with the affairs of the Low\r\nCountries. In return, the Prince undertook to use all his influence\r\nwith the Tsar in favour of the acknowledgment of the sovereignty of\r\nthe King of the French. At a Council of Ministers it was resolved\r\nthat Talleyrand should be instructed to bring the affair to the\r\nnotice of the British Cabinet, and that Molé should draw up a note\r\nfor presentation at the Hague, expressing surprise at the continued\r\nsilence observed towards the French government. Two days later,\r\nhowever, the news was telegraphed from Strasburg that General Atthalin\r\nhad passed through the town, bringing with him the Tsar's recognition\r\nof Louis Philippe. But, upon the general's arrival, the satisfaction\r\ncaused by this intelligence was diminished by the cold and formal\r\nlanguage of Nicholas's letter, and by his pointed omission to address\r\nthe King as \"his brother,\" the designation generally employed by\r\nsovereigns in their communications with each other.[37]\r\n\r\nThe proposal of the English government that a conference should\r\nbe held upon Belgian affairs having been accepted by the\r\nPowers, it remained only to decide upon the town in which the\r\ndeliberations should take place. London, where for some time past\r\nthe representatives of Russia, France, and Great Britain had been\r\nengaged in settling the frontiers and discussing the future of Greece,\r\nappeared to be the capital in which, by reason of its proximity\r\nto Brussels, the plenipotentiaries could assemble with the least\r\ninconvenience. France alone dissented from this view, and urgently\r\ndemanded that the conference should be held in Paris. Aberdeen, when\r\nTalleyrand communicated to him his instructions upon the subject,\r\nwould appear to have seen little to object to in the French proposal.\r\nWellington, however, refused to entertain the suggestion, for a\r\nmoment. It was highly important, the Duke contended, that matters\r\nshould be settled promptly, and he was confident that he could induce\r\nthe ministers attending the conference to agree to the French and\r\nEnglish proposals, provided they were to meet in London. On the other\r\nhand, were Paris to be the scene of their deliberations, they would\r\ninsist upon referring every question to their respective Courts.\r\nTalleyrand, who considered that there was much sound reason in the\r\nDuke's contention, was nevertheless directed to reiterate his demand.\r\nBut his further representations only evoked the reply that the English\r\nCabinet regarded Paris as _un terrain trop agité_, and at a subsequent\r\ninterview, on October 25, in the presence of the ambassadors of\r\nAustria and Prussia, the Duke assured him that the Powers were\r\nunanimous in opposing the notion of discussing the affairs of the\r\nLow Countries amidst the _tourbillon révolutionaire_ of the French\r\ncapital.[38]\r\n\r\nIn his conversations with Lord Stuart de Rothesay in Paris, Molé,\r\nin order to gain his ends, had recourse to a singular argument.\r\nTalleyrand himself, he explained, constituted the true reason why the\r\ngovernment was desirous that the Belgian conference should not take\r\nplace in London. He never would have been accredited to the Court of\r\nSt. James' had ministers foreseen how greatly the public would resent\r\nhis appointment. To allow him to represent France at a very important\r\nconference would expose the Cabinet to attacks which must prove\r\nfatal to its existence. \"This extraordinary reason for objecting to\r\nour proposition,\" wrote Aberdeen, \"does not appear to His Majesty's\r\ngovernment to be entitled to serious consideration.\" Molé nevertheless\r\ncontinued to press his point with much warmth, and it was only after\r\nseveral more interviews with Lord Stuart that he began to talk of\r\nsending a second plenipotentiary to the London conference to be\r\nassociated with Talleyrand.[39] This plan, which was probably not put\r\nforward seriously, was certainly never carried into execution. At the\r\nend of October, the Cabinet was reconstructed, and Molé resigned the\r\nportfolio of Foreign Affairs. After his retirement no further allusion\r\nappears to have been made to the alleged inconvenience of Talleyrand's\r\npresence at the London conference. Molé was perhaps jealous of\r\nallowing him to conduct these important negotiations, in which he\r\nprobably desired himself to play the chief part. He was a highly\r\ncultivated man, with much charm of manner, and of an ancient family,\r\nand in Imperial days had enjoyed the favour of the Emperor, and had\r\nheld important positions. Under the Restoration he had been Minister\r\nof Marine in Richelieu's first administration, and in this capacity\r\nhad incurred Louis XVIII.'s displeasure by intriguing against his\r\nfavourite the Duc Décazes.\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet, known as that of August 11th, had never been a united\r\nbody. Guizot, Broglie, Molé and Casimir Périer constituted the\r\nConservative element, whilst Laffitte and Dupont were opposed to all\r\nmeasures which savoured of resistance to progress upon democratic\r\nlines. The riots of October 17 and 18, in Paris, the mob's protest\r\nagainst the apparent intention of the government to abolish the\r\ndeath penalty in political cases, in order to save the lives of the\r\nimprisoned ex-ministers of Charles X., brought matters to a crisis.\r\nSeeing that the King decidedly inclined to the views of Laffitte and\r\nthe so-called party of _laissez-aller_ the Conservatives, advising\r\nhim to give the policy of their dissenting colleagues a fair trial,\r\ntendered their resignations. Laffitte was accordingly charged with the\r\ntask of reconstructing the Cabinet.[40]\r\n\r\nOn November 2, the day on which the composition of the new French\r\nministry was published in the _Moniteur_, King William IV. formally\r\nopened the British Parliament. In the Speech from the Throne, the\r\nBelgians were described as \"revolted subjects\" and the intention was\r\nexpressed of repressing sternly disturbances at home. In the House of\r\nLords, Grey deprecated the employment of such language, and, in reply,\r\nWellington made his declaration against Reform. A fortnight later,\r\nupon a motion of Sir Henry Parnell for referring the Civil List to a\r\nselect committee, the government was placed in a minority. The Duke\r\nthereupon resigned and advised the King to send for Grey. Lord Grey\r\nundertook to form a ministry upon the understanding that he was to\r\nbring forward a measure of Reform.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                       THE CREATION OF BELGIUM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe accession to power of Lord Grey was an event justly calculated\r\nto raise the hopes of those who wished to see more cordial relations\r\nestablished between France and England. The Whigs had been out of\r\noffice during the whole period of the Imperial wars; they had not\r\nbeen concerned in the territorial settlement at the peace, nor were\r\nthey responsible for the measures which had been taken to ensure the\r\nsafe custody of Bonaparte after Waterloo. Many prominent members of\r\nthe party had avowed their sympathy for France, and, moreover, the\r\nrevolution of July had, unquestionably, contributed to the overthrow\r\nof the Tories. Under the new _régime_ in France political power was\r\nto rest with the _bourgeoisie_. It was by the support of the trading\r\nand commercial classes that the Whigs purposed to carry out their\r\nscheme of Parliamentary Reform. Nor were these the only circumstances\r\nwhich seemed to indicate that the two countries would, in the future,\r\ndevelop upon parallel lines. Although William IV. had succeeded to\r\nthe throne legitimately, whilst a revolution had placed the crown\r\nupon the head of Louis Philippe, and although no two men could be\r\nmore different in character, there were, upon the surface, curious\r\npoints of resemblance between them. Both were, or were supposed to\r\nbe, Liberals, both were simple and unostentatious in their tastes and\r\nhabits, both had succeeded sovereigns of reactionary views who had\r\nbeen rigid observers of courtly ceremony and etiquette.\r\n\r\n\"England,\" wrote Talleyrand in a despatch in which he reviewed the\r\nsituation created by the change of government, \"is the country with\r\nwhich France should cultivate the most friendly relations. Her\r\ncolonial losses have removed a source of rivalry between them. The\r\nPowers still believe in the divine right of kings; France and England\r\nalone no longer subscribe to that doctrine. Both governments have\r\nadopted the principle of non-intervention. Let both declare loudly\r\nthat they are resolved to maintain peace, and their voices will not be\r\nraised in vain.\"[41]\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston, the Secretary for Foreign Affairs, was in his\r\nforty-sixth year. From 1811 he had continuously held the post of\r\nSecretary-at-War in succeeding Tory administrations until the year\r\n1828, when, with other _Canningites_, he had seceded from the Duke\r\nof Wellington. He was an excellent linguist; indeed, in the opinion\r\nof so competent a critic as Victor Cousin, there were not twenty\r\nFrenchmen who could lay claim to his knowledge of their language.[42]\r\nIn the course of a visit which he had paid to Paris, in the year 1829,\r\nPalmerston had made the acquaintance of most of the prominent members\r\nof the Liberal party under the Restoration. From his conversations\r\nwith these men, who were now the masters of France, he had carried\r\naway the conviction that they chafed bitterly at the treaties of 1815\r\nand were determined, at the first opportunity, to extend the French\r\nfrontiers to the Rhine. General Sébastiani, who, on November 15, had\r\nsucceeded Marshal Maison as Minister for Foreign Affairs, had, whilst\r\nin opposition, been one of the loudest advocates of a policy of\r\nexpansion.[43] The recollection of his boastful language and of the\r\naggressive schemes which he had heard him propound was always present\r\nin Palmerston's memory, and was sensibly to influence his conduct of\r\nhis first negotiations with the French government.\r\n\r\nThe general outlook in Europe in the autumn of 1830 augured ill for\r\nthe continued maintenance of peace. Great military preparations were\r\nreported to be in progress in Russia. Marshal Diebitsch, the hero\r\nof the recent war with Turkey, was at Berlin upon a mission which,\r\nalthough it was described, as \"wholly extra official,\"[44] excited\r\nconsiderable apprehension in Paris. Insurrectionary movements, the\r\nrepercussion of the Revolution of July, had taken place in Saxony\r\nand other States of Northern Germany. Metternich was said \"to have\r\nproposed certain armaments to the Diet, wholly out of proportion to\r\nthe necessities of the situation.\" The King of Prussia, although\r\nhe was universally credited with a sincere desire for peace, was\r\nsuspected, nevertheless, \"of preparing quietly for war.\" The alarm was\r\nnot dispelled by the assurances which, in London, Prince Lieven gave\r\nto both Palmerston and Talleyrand that the Russian armament was merely\r\na measure of precaution necessitated by treaty obligations with the\r\nKing of the Netherlands, and that, under no circumstances, would his\r\nImperial master take action except in combination with the Powers.[45]\r\nOn December 1 the French Chamber voted supplies for a considerable\r\nincrease of the army.\r\n\r\nThe suspicion that the three Northern Courts were meditating an\r\nunprovoked attack upon France was unfounded. As Lord Heytesbury\r\npointed out, the cholera, which had made its appearance in the\r\nTsar's dominions, threw an insuperable obstacle in the way of\r\nrecruiting upon a large scale. Russia indeed, he considered, might\r\nalmost be looked upon as _hors de combat_.[46] Nor was Metternich\r\nproposing to begin hostilities against France. \"Austria's task,\"\r\nhe instructed Esterhazy, the ambassador in London, \"consists in\r\nsuppressing any insurrectionary movement in Italy.\" But should the\r\nFrench interpose in favour of the revolutionists, their action must be\r\nresisted vigorously. It was expedient, therefore, for the three great\r\ncontinental Powers to hold their armies in readiness. \"The British\r\ngovernment must be brought to understand that Austria cannot accept\r\nthe principle of non-intervention. England, as an insular State, can\r\nadhere to it without danger, but when adopted by France it imperils\r\nthe existence of neighbouring Powers. The proclamation of such a\r\ndoctrine can be compared only to the complaints of thieves about the\r\ninterference of the police.\"[47] But, although the absolute Courts\r\nwere certainly innocent of any desire to provoke a war deliberately,\r\nthere were serious elements of danger in the situation. The King of\r\nthe Netherlands, without doubt, looked upon the outbreak of a great\r\nEuropean war as the only chance of regaining his Belgian provinces.\r\nCharles X. was once more installed quietly in his old quarters at\r\nHolyrood, but his adherents, the Legitimists, or Carlists, as they\r\nwere more usually termed, were convinced that a war must prove fatal\r\nto the new _régime_ in France. Talleyrand suspected that they were in\r\nleague with the military party in Paris, and suggested that an agent\r\nshould be sent over to London to watch them. He had no complaints to\r\nmake about the assistance afforded him by the Home Secretary, who\r\nplaced all the information he could obtain about them at his disposal,\r\nbut, \"in a country in which the police system was so bad, such reports\r\nhad little value.\"[48]\r\n\r\nAt the Congress of Vienna nearly the whole of those territories, known\r\nas the Grand Duchy of Warsaw, had been constituted into the Kingdom of\r\nPoland and assigned to the Tsar. Under the terms of the treaty, which\r\nwas guaranteed by the Five Powers, the crown of the Kingdom was to be\r\nhereditary in the Imperial family of Russia. The Poles, however, were\r\nto be granted a constitution, and were to be allowed to maintain a\r\nnational army. These stipulations were duly carried out by Alexander.\r\nBut, as the Tsar's Liberalism waned, the first conditions were\r\nconsiderably modified, and, after the accession of Nicholas, the Poles\r\nappear to have suspected, with perhaps good reason, that the Imperial\r\nCabinet purposed to abolish gradually all their special privileges.\r\nSuddenly, on November 28, 1830, an insurrection broke out at Warsaw.\r\nThe Viceroy, the Grand Duke Constantine, was driven from the town and\r\nseveral of his generals were murdered. The revolution spread rapidly\r\nthrough the country, and, after some vain attempts to negotiate a\r\ncompromise, the Grand Duke retreated across the frontier with his\r\nRussian troops. On December 5, Chlopicki, a popular Polish general,\r\nwho had served with distinction under Bonaparte, was proclaimed\r\nDictator. Nicholas, whilst collecting his troops to reconquer his\r\nrevolted kingdom, declared that the French revolutionary propaganda\r\nand the creation of Lancastrian schools[49] were responsible for the\r\ninsurrection.[50]\r\n\r\nThe rebellion evoked the utmost enthusiasm in Paris. The designation\r\nof \"the Frenchmen of the North,\" which it became the fashion to apply\r\nto the Poles, tickled the national vanity. It was remembered that\r\nthey had remained true to Bonaparte in his misfortunes, and that\r\nthe unsympathetic treatment which they had experienced at the hands\r\nof the sovereigns at Vienna had been the penalty of their fidelity.\r\nMoreover, it was a natural consequence of their hatred of the treaties\r\nof 1815 that Frenchmen should feel drawn towards those countries\r\nwhich, like Poland or Italy, had cause for dissatisfaction with the\r\nconditions settled at the Congress of Vienna. Unquestionably this was\r\nthe secret of much of that sympathy for \"oppressed nationalities\"\r\nwhich, from 1830 onwards, manifested itself so keenly in France. The\r\nwar party and other factions hostile to the monarchy encouraged the\r\npopular ferment. Lord Stuart de Rothesay was disposed to think that\r\nLouis Philippe and his ministers regarded the excitement with secret\r\napproval, in the hope that it would distract public attention from\r\nthe impending trial of the ex-ministers of Charles X.[51] In addition\r\nto Polignac himself three members of the Cabinet, who had signed the\r\nordinances of July, had failed to escape abroad. The King, however,\r\nnotwithstanding that the populace called furiously for their heads,\r\nwas determined to save their lives. This merciful intention he was\r\nenabled to carry out successfully. On December 21 the peers adjudged\r\nthem guilty of high treason but, in deference to Louis Philippe's\r\nwishes, sentenced them only to perpetual confinement. Meanwhile\r\nMontalivet, the Minister of the Interior, had personally conducted the\r\nprisoners back to Vincennes, where they were lodged in safety before\r\nthe mob, which thronged all the approaches to the Luxembourg, realized\r\nthat it had been baulked of its prey. The satisfactory conclusion of\r\nthis momentous trial was followed by an event of no less happy augury\r\nfor the future. Nettled by a resolution of the Chamber affecting his\r\nposition, La Fayette retired from the command of the national guard.\r\nThe government accepted his resignation with grave misgivings, but, to\r\nthe general surprise, the fickle multitude saw their hero replaced by\r\nMouton de Lobau with comparative indifference.\r\n\r\nBut of all the questions which threatened to disturb the peace of\r\nEurope, that of Belgium, by reason of the conflict of national\r\ninterests to which it gave rise, was by far the most delicate. It\r\nis not without cause that, for centuries, the Low Countries have\r\nbeen the chief battle ground of the Powers. Bonaparte is supposed to\r\nhave described the possession of Antwerp as \"a loaded pistol held\r\nat England's head.\" Unquestionably, during the great war, England\r\nhad had experience of the difficulties of watching the coastline of\r\nBelgium and Holland united to that of France. The lesson had not\r\nbeen thrown away upon Lords Grey and Palmerston, who were fully\r\ndetermined to resist, at all costs, the acquisition of any portion\r\nof the Low Countries by a first-class military Power. On the other\r\nhand France had excellent reasons for objecting to the system\r\nunder which the Kingdom of the Netherlands had been created, and\r\nthe barrier fortresses erected. In the words of General Lamarque,\r\nthe chief parliamentary spokesman of the war party, these defences\r\nconstituted, within four days' march of Paris, a _tête de pont_ behind\r\nwhich the armies of a hostile coalition might assemble at leisure.\r\nMoreover, France, in 1815, had been deprived of the fortresses of\r\nMarienburg and Philippeville, both of which had been incorporated\r\ninto the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and it was hoped that in any\r\nscheme of re-arrangement these two places would be restored to\r\nher. All supporters of the new monarchy were keenly alive to the\r\nimmense satisfaction with which the smallest modification of the\r\nhated treaties of 1815 would be received throughout the country. Men\r\nof moderate views, such as Charles de Rémusat and Guizot, looked\r\nupon \"a brilliant diplomatic triumph\" or \"some acquisition of\r\nterritory towards Belgium\" as conditions essential to the stability\r\nof the Orleans throne.[52] On the other hand, it was the policy of\r\nAustria, Prussia and Russia, as it was that of Great Britain, to\r\npreserve intact the territorial settlement of 1815 and to resist the\r\naggrandisement of France. But the attitude of the Northern Courts\r\nwas also greatly influenced by the marriages which connected the\r\nKing of the Netherlands and the Prince of Orange with the Royal\r\nfamily of Prussia and the Imperial House of Russia. In addition to\r\nthese considerations of relationship the sympathies of the absolute\r\nsovereigns necessarily went out to a monarch struggling with a\r\nrebellion of his subjects, and they could not but be reluctant to\r\nparticipate in measures tending to legalize a revolution.\r\n\r\nThe first sitting of the conference of the five Powers upon Belgian\r\naffairs took place at the Foreign Office in London, on November 4,\r\non which occasion it was decided to impose an armistice upon the\r\ncontending parties. According to the protocol, the Dutch and Belgian\r\narmies \"were to retire behind the line which, previous to the treaty\r\nof May 30, 1814, separated the possessions of the sovereign prince\r\nof the United Provinces from the territories which have since been\r\njoined to them.\"[53] No further step of much importance was taken\r\nuntil December 20, when Talleyrand proposed that the conference\r\nshould proclaim the independence of Belgium.[54] After a discussion\r\nof seven hours' duration, the objections of the plenipotentiaries\r\nof the absolute Powers were withdrawn, and the plan was acceded to\r\nunanimously. A month later, on January 20, 1831, the frontiers of\r\nHolland and Belgium were defined, and Belgium was declared neutral\r\nunder the guarantee of the Powers. At the sitting of January 27, the\r\nplenipotentiaries apportioned the share of the general debt which each\r\nState would be called upon to bear.[55]\r\n\r\nThe difficult question of selecting a sovereign for Belgium was\r\nnot lost sight of, whilst the delimitation of frontiers had been\r\nproceeding. As early as October 19, Molé informed Lord Stuart\r\nin confidence that M. Gendebien had brought proposals from the\r\nprovisional government in Brussels for the enthronement of one of\r\nLouis Philippe's younger sons. But he assured the British ambassador\r\nthat, as France was about to confer upon the situation with the other\r\nPowers, the offer would not be entertained for a moment.[56] Again\r\nTalleyrand, on November 7, reported that \"a kind of agent of the\r\nprovisional government\" was in London seeking to ascertain whether the\r\nelevation to the Belgian throne of the Duc de Leuchtenberg, a son of\r\nEugène de Beauharnais, would be permitted.[57] At first the Powers,\r\nFrance included, had regarded the enthronement of the Prince of Orange\r\nas the safest solution of the difficulty. But after the bombardment\r\nof the town of Antwerp by the Dutch, at the end of October, he\r\nbecame very unpopular, and, on November 24, the national congress\r\nat Brussels resolved that all members of the House of Orange-Nassau\r\nshould be excluded from the throne.[58] In consequence, possibly,\r\nof this action by the Belgian deputies, Lords Grey and Palmerston\r\nappear to have mentioned the Archduke Charles of Austria to Talleyrand\r\nas a suitable candidate. But he objected, reminding them that his\r\nenthronement would constitute a restoration, which the most famous\r\nof Whigs had once described as \"the worst of revolutions.\" Moreover,\r\nMetternich, who had no desire to extend the influence of Austria in\r\nthat direction, soon afterwards declared that the Archduke would\r\ndecline the crown, both for himself and for his children, were it to\r\nbe offered to him.[59] Talleyrand himself appears to have been the\r\nfirst to suggest that Leopold of Saxe-Coburg might with advantage be\r\nchosen to rule over the new State.[60] In putting forward this plan\r\nhe seems to have been actuated chiefly by a desire to please the\r\nBritish government, but, for reasons which will be explained later,\r\nhis proposal met with very little response. Meanwhile, the language of\r\nMauguin and Lamarque in the Chamber, and the evident intention of the\r\nmilitary party to object to any settlement which should not admit of\r\nthe future union of Belgium with France, were rapidly impelling Louis\r\nPhilippe to adopt an attitude of opposition to Great Britain and the\r\nother Powers.[61]\r\n\r\nAt the first sitting of the conference it had been decided that M.\r\nBresson, the first secretary of the French embassy in London, and\r\nMr. Cartwright, who held a similar position at the British embassy\r\nat the Hague, should act as the commissioners of the Powers at\r\nBrussels. Cartwright, however, had soon been recalled in order that\r\nhe might assume the duties of British minister at Frankfort, and Lord\r\nPonsonby had been sent to take his place at Brussels. Ponsonby was\r\nthe brother-in-law of Lord Grey and was reputed to be the handsomest\r\nman of his time. There was a story that as a youth he had been set\r\nupon by the mob in the Rue Saint-Honoré, in the early days of the\r\nrevolution, and that it was only the protests of the women, that he\r\nwas too good-looking to be hanged, which had saved him from \"_la\r\nlanterne_.\" Canning is said to have sent him to Buenos Ayres, in 1826,\r\nupon his first diplomatic mission of importance, in order to please\r\nGeorge IV., whose peace of mind was disturbed by Lady Cunningham's\r\ntoo evident admiration of him.[62] In Belgium, at this time, the two\r\nchief political parties were the French party, consisting of the\r\nadvocates of a union with France, and the Orange party, the members\r\nof which favoured the enthronement of the Prince of Orange. The first\r\nwere unquestionably by far the most numerous, but the Orangists, who\r\nwere to be found chiefly in business and commercial circles, were not\r\nwithout power and influence. Bresson, from the first moment of his\r\narrival at Brussels, appears to have identified himself closely with\r\nthe aspirations of the French party, whilst Ponsonby espoused no less\r\nzealously the cause of the Prince of Orange.[63] There was, thus,\r\nkeen rivalry and apparently much personal dislike between these two\r\nrepresentatives of the conference.\r\n\r\nLouis Philippe would never appear seriously to have entertained\r\nthe notion of allowing one of his younger sons to accept the crown\r\nof Belgium, or of consenting to the union of Belgium with France.\r\nLord Grey had given Talleyrand, who had been directed to sound the\r\nBritish government upon the subject, clearly to understand that the\r\nenthronement of a French prince would be regarded as a case for\r\nwar--a declaration, which, in the words of Sébastiani, \"had at least\r\nthe merit of frankness.\"[64] Of all the possible candidates for the\r\nBelgian crown Louis Philippe justly considered the Duc de Leuchtenberg\r\nto be the most undesirable. To have allowed any one connected with the\r\nBonaparte family to become King of Belgium would have been exceedingly\r\ndangerous to the French monarchy. \"There are no personal objections to\r\nhim,\" wrote Sébastiani to Bresson, \"but all considerations must give\r\nway before the _raison d'état_.\"[65] The candidate for whose success\r\nLouis Philippe was in reality most anxious, and whose selection\r\nSébastiani instructed both Bresson and Talleyrand to advocate\r\ncautiously, was Prince Charles of Naples. This young prince was a\r\nNeapolitan Bourbon, a brother of the Duchesse de Berri and a nephew\r\nof the French queen, Marie Amélie, and Louis Philippe was always as\r\ndesirous as any king of the old _régime_ to promote the aggrandizement\r\nof his family. But when Talleyrand mentioned his name to Lord Grey he\r\nwas told at once that his connection with the reigning House in France\r\nconstituted an insuperable objection,[66] whilst from Brussels Bresson\r\nreported that \"the Prince of Naples had no following.\"[67]\r\n\r\nA second attempt, on the part of the provisional government at\r\nBrussels to persuade Louis Philippe to accept the crown for his\r\nson, was made in December 1830. On that occasion M. Van de Weyer\r\ncarried the proposal to Paris. British hostility was to be overcome\r\nby the marriage of Nemours, the young prince whom it was proposed\r\nto elevate to the throne, to an English princess, and by the\r\nconversion of Antwerp into a free port and by the destruction of\r\nits fortifications.[68] Louis Philippe declined the offer, but the\r\nalready-mentioned instructions sent to Talleyrand to ascertain the\r\nviews of the British government upon the subject were probably a\r\nconsequence of Van de Weyer's mission. Bresson, however, soon after\r\nhe had received Sébastiani's despatch, informing him of the King's\r\ndetermination to refuse the crown for his son, expressed great\r\nfear lest Leuchtenberg should be selected. His candidature was, he\r\nreported, the result of a Bonapartist intrigue organized in Paris, but\r\nthe Belgians were tired of their unsettled condition and were anxious\r\nthat a ruler of some kind should be chosen.[69] Some ten days later he\r\nforwarded intelligence of a more precise and of a yet more disquieting\r\nnature. The French party, led by M. Gendebien, in consequence of the\r\nrefusal of Nemours, had now definitely adopted Leuchtenberg as their\r\ncandidate. Moreover, three notorious Bonapartist generals, Excelmans,\r\nLallemand and Fabvier, were reported to have arrived at Namur and\r\nLiège. This news was followed the next day by a despatch in which he\r\ncomplained of Ponsonby's activity on behalf of the Prince of Orange\r\nand, at the same time, accused him of being favourable to the election\r\nof Leuchtenberg.[70]\r\n\r\nLouis Philippe was genuinely disquieted by Bresson's news. He was\r\nresolved, he told Lord Granville, who, early in January, had replaced\r\nLord Stuart de Rothesay at the British embassy, to send the Comte de\r\nFlahaut to London to impress upon the government the keen anxiety\r\nwith which he regarded the march of events at Brussels. By existing\r\ntreaties, he reminded him, no member of the Bonaparte family was\r\nallowed to live in Belgium, and, in the course of conversation,\r\nhe hinted that a Neapolitan prince would be the best king for the\r\nnew State.[71] Flahaut was a distinguished general officer of the\r\nempire and was, besides, the admitted father of that half-brother\r\nof Louis Napoleon, who was to acquire celebrity under the name\r\nof the Duc de Morny. During the greater part of the Restoration\r\nperiod Flahaut had lived in London, where his attractive manners\r\nand charm of conversation had made him a popular member of society.\r\nMoreover, during his residence in England, he had married Miss Mercer\r\nElphinstone, a great heiress of her day.[72] The mission, upon which\r\nhe was now despatched to London, was not confined merely to the\r\ncommunication to the British government of Louis Philippe's fears\r\nrespecting a Bonapartist candidate for the Belgian throne. But, as\r\nhis instructions are not to be found among the diplomatic papers of\r\nthe period, the exact nature of the proposals he was empowered to\r\nmake can only be conjectured. In a private letter to Granville, on\r\nFebruary 8, Palmerston speaks of a suggested offensive and defensive\r\nalliance between France and Great Britain \"which was to be kept an\r\nentire secret from all the world,\" to which proposal he had replied,\r\n\"that these alliances are not popular in England, but that if France\r\nwere attacked unjustly, England would be found upon her side.\"[73]\r\nFrom the despatches of Granville and of Talleyrand it may be inferred\r\nwith certainty that some scheme was on foot whereby France was to\r\nacquire a part of Belgium and, in return for her consent to this plan,\r\nEngland was to have the right of garrisoning Antwerp, which was to be\r\ndeclared a free port.[74] Talleyrand, whilst favourable to the idea of\r\nconverting Antwerp into a Hanseatic town, was very much opposed to the\r\nnotion of assisting England to regain a footing upon the continent. It\r\nwould be too high a price to pay, he contended, even for so popular a\r\nmeasure as the extension of the French frontiers into Belgium.[75]\r\n\r\nWhilst Flahaut was thus engaged in London, Colonel the Marquis de\r\nLawoëstine, a former _aide-de-camp_ of Sébastiani and a Belgian of\r\ngood family, had been despatched to Brussels. In his case also the\r\nprecise object of his errand can only be surmised. It is clear,\r\nhowever, that M. Juste[76] is mistaken in supposing that he was\r\nsent to urge the national congress to elect the Duc de Nemours. \"In\r\ngeneral,\" wrote Sébastiani to Bresson, when announcing the despatch of\r\nLawoëstine, \"you must say as little as possible about his mission, but\r\nyou need make no mystery about it to Lord Ponsonby,\"[77] a sentence\r\nwhich precludes the possibility that his journey to Brussels can have\r\nbeen connected with the election of a son of Louis Philippe. Without\r\ndoubt Lawoëstine was primarily charged to combat the candidature\r\nof Leuchtenberg, but it would seem that he was directed quietly\r\nto oppose Prince Charles of Naples to him. \"It will be difficult,\"\r\nanswered Bresson upon receipt of Sébastiani's despatch, \"to keep\r\nsecret the object of Lawoëstine's mission. The candidature of Prince\r\nCharles of Naples has been talked about and the factions in Paris are\r\nworking against him. Even M. de Mérode[78] is threatening to abandon\r\nPrince Charles and to vote in favour of the Duc de Leuchtenberg.\"[79]\r\n\r\nLawoëstine, after \"seeing all the chief people,\" appears to have\r\nreturned to Paris to lay before the King the urgency of the situation,\r\nwhilst the tone of Bresson's despatches, during the next few days,\r\nbecame yet more alarming. The bust of the Duc de Leuchtenberg, he\r\nreported, had been crowned at the theatre amidst cries of \"_Vive\r\nAugust 1^{er}, Roi des Belges_.\" Only, he considered, by the\r\nnomination of the Duc de Nemours could Leuchtenberg be combated\r\neffectually.[80] Bresson himself, probably on either January 25\r\nor 26, seems to have paid a hurried visit to Paris. On February 1\r\nthe national congress was to proceed to elect a King for Belgium,\r\nand, presumably, he wished to obtain fuller instructions as to the\r\nattitude he was to adopt in the different eventualities which might\r\narise. By this time the 11th protocol of the London conference, that\r\nof January 20, 1831, defining the boundaries of Holland and Belgium,\r\nhad been received by Lord Ponsonby and himself for communication to\r\nthe provisional government. The conditions of separation, as laid\r\ndown in that document, fell far short of the hopes of the Belgians.\r\nThey claimed the districts of Luxemburg and Limburg, but the Powers\r\nassigned these provinces to Holland. The King of the Netherlands was\r\nalso Grand Duke of Luxemburg and as such was a member of the Germanic\r\nConfederation. His position had been recognized by the conference\r\nwhich, in its protocol of December 20, 1830, had formally declared\r\nits incompetence to interfere with territories forming part of the\r\nConfederation, a decision which excited equal dissatisfaction in Paris\r\nand in Brussels. If she could not obtain Luxemburg for herself, France\r\nhoped to see this province withdrawn from the Germanic Confederation\r\nand handed over to Belgium.\r\n\r\nOn January 29 Bresson reported his return to Brussels, having\r\nperformed the journey from the French capital in twenty-five hours.\r\nHe would appear to have been empowered by Louis Philippe himself to\r\nassure the members of the national congress that, were Nemours to be\r\nelected, he would be allowed to accept the crown. It is probable,\r\nhowever, that he was instructed only to resort to this step should\r\nhe find it impossible to oppose Leuchtenberg successfully by other\r\nmeans. It may be inferred that neither Bresson nor Lawoëstine felt\r\nany enthusiasm about the election of a Neapolitan Bourbon, and were\r\nonly too anxious to bestir themselves actively on behalf of a French\r\nprince. \"Ponsonby supports Leuchtenberg as leading up to the Prince\r\nof Orange,\" wrote Bresson on the day of his return.[81] \"The effect\r\nof Lord Ponsonby's communication to the congress of the protocol of\r\nJanuary 20 has been very great,\" reported Lawoëstine, who also was\r\nback in Brussels. \"The only way of preventing the election of the Duc\r\nde Leuchtenberg is by bringing forward the Duc de Nemours. Even at the\r\nrisk of a war with the Powers this course should be adopted. Belgium\r\nwould be with us heart and soul, and we should begin the campaign in\r\npossession of the 23 frontier fortresses, all of which are provided\r\nwith an immense _matériel_.\"[82]\r\n\r\nOn receipt of this news from his agents at Brussels Sébastiani, in\r\norder, presumably, to influence the national congress in favour of\r\nthe French candidate, despatched a letter to Bresson the contents\r\nof which were intended for communication to the Belgian deputies.\r\nIn this document, dated February 1, Sébastiani stated that France\r\ncould not give her consent to the delimitation of frontiers or to\r\nthe apportionment of the debt, as laid down in the 11th and 12th\r\nprotocols of the London conference, unless these conditions should\r\nbe deemed satisfactory by both the States concerned. The French\r\ngovernment, holding that the conference had been convened for\r\npurposes of mediation only, could not allow it to assume a different\r\ncharacter.[83] On February 3 the Duc de Nemours was elected King\r\nof the Belgians, and a deputation started at once for Paris to\r\ncommunicate the news officially to Louis Philippe.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Sébastiani, on February 2, had informed Talleyrand\r\nthat, were the Belgians to elect a son of Louis Philippe for their\r\nKing, he would decline to accept the crown, but the occasion was to be\r\nutilized for bringing forward the Prince of Naples. He was confident\r\nthat, in order to escape from the complications entailed by Nemours'\r\nelection, the Powers, at present hostile to the Neapolitan prince,\r\nwould look upon his enthronement as a happy alternative. On February 4\r\nhe again affirmed the King's intention of declining the crown for his\r\nson, but his despatch of the following day was replete with complaints\r\nof Ponsonby's efforts upon behalf of the Prince of Orange, a course of\r\nconduct which, he declared, would inevitably lead to civil war. Were\r\nserious disturbances to break out in Belgium, France would be driven\r\nto intervene, and it was, therefore, necessary for Lords Grey and\r\nPalmerston to understand that the situation was extremely critical.[84]\r\n\r\nTalleyrand, however, was doing all in his power to convince his\r\ngovernment of the disastrous effect which the rumours from Brussels\r\nwere having upon public opinion in London. His declaration to the\r\nconference, on February 7, that the King of the French would refuse\r\nthe crown of Belgium for his son had made a very good impression,\r\nand it had induced the plenipotentiaries to guarantee that, were\r\nLeuchtenberg to be elected, he would not be acknowledged by their\r\nrespective Courts.[85] But, on the same day, he reported that the\r\nCabinet, after a prolonged sitting, had resolved to declare war upon\r\nFrance, should the crown of Belgium be accepted by Nemours, and he\r\nbegged Sébastiani to reflect most seriously upon the consequences of\r\na naval conflict. Bresson's behaviour at Brussels, he complained, had\r\nplaced him in a very difficult position, and if the King could not\r\nsee his way to follow his advice, his continued presence in London\r\ncould no longer serve any useful purpose, Montrond, who by his desire\r\nwas returning to Paris, would tell the King and his ministers that\r\nin London, at the clubs and in society, the prospects of a war with\r\nFrance were the chief topic of conversation.[86]\r\n\r\nAlthough Louis Philippe and Sébastiani repeatedly assured Lord\r\nGranville that there was no intention of accepting the crown for\r\nNemours,[87] it was not until February 17 that the King officially\r\nreceived the members of the deputation and signified to them his\r\nrefusal. The interval, between their arrival in Paris and their\r\nformal interview with Louis Philippe, appears to have been employed\r\nin vain attempts to induce them to pronounce themselves in favour\r\nof the Neapolitan prince. \"We have tried to make them see,\" wrote\r\nSébastiani to Talleyrand, \"the advantages which would accrue to all\r\nparties from the enthronement of Prince Charles of Naples.\"[88]\r\nBut, in the meantime, his letter to Bresson of February 1, in which\r\nhe had declared that the French government could not adhere to the\r\n11th and 12th protocols of the conference, had been published in the\r\nBelgian newspapers and had caused Palmerston to instruct Granville to\r\ndemand an explanation. The ambassador was to point out that, \"when\r\na government sees fit to disavow the acts of its plenipotentiary,\r\nit should acquaint the parties with whom the engagement has been\r\nmade of the fact, not, as in this case, communicate its disavowal to\r\nthird parties.\" Palmerston's despatch concluded with the intimation\r\nthat \"His Majesty's government had only allowed the conference to\r\ncontinue because it was convinced that satisfactory explanations would\r\nbe forthcoming.\" Instructions of a like nature were received by the\r\nRussian, the Prussian and the Austrian ambassadors.\"[89]\r\n\r\nSébastiani, whilst pretending that Bresson had no authority to make\r\npublic his letter, maintained that the London conference had no power\r\nto do more than mediate between the contending parties, and that\r\nFrance \"could not be a member of a revised Holy Alliance which was\r\nto decide arbitrarily upon the affairs of nations.\" Furthermore he\r\ndeclined to recall M. Bresson from Brussels, unless Lord Ponsonby\r\nwere removed at the same time.[90] Fresh instances were soon\r\nforthcoming, however, of Bresson's opposition to the decisions of the\r\nconference of which he was nominally the agent. Since the conclusion\r\nof the armistice between the Belgians and the Dutch, disputes had\r\nbeen frequent as to the infractions of its conditions. The Dutch,\r\nin violation of the terms imposed by the Powers, held the citadel\r\nof Antwerp and closed the navigation of the Scheldt, whilst, as a\r\nreprisal, the Belgians set up a blockade of Maëstricht. The conference\r\nhad, in consequence, instructed its representatives at Brussels to\r\nwarn the provisional government that, unless communications were\r\nopened between Maëstricht and the surrounding country, the Federal\r\nDiet would be invited to raise the blockade by force of arms. But\r\nM. Bresson, alleging as a reason for his conduct _des motifs à lui\r\npersonnels_, declined to sign the note which Lord Ponsonby duly\r\npresented to the Belgian Minister for Foreign Affairs.[91] Lord\r\nGranville was in consequence directed to inform Sébastiani that the\r\nconference could no longer regard M. Bresson as its agent.[92] When\r\nthe contents of Palmerston's despatch were read out to him Sébastiani\r\ndeclared that he should retain him at Brussels as French minister.[93]\r\nThis was, however, but an empty threat. Bresson, since Louis\r\nPhilippe's refusal to allow his son to be proclaimed King, was most\r\nunpleasantly situated towards the members of the national congress,\r\nto whom he had given the most positive assurances that, were Nemours\r\nto be elected, he would be permitted to accept the crown. It is very\r\nprobable that in order to overcome the hesitation of his government he\r\nmay deliberately have expressed exaggerated fears about the prospects\r\nof Leuchtenberg's enthronement. The complete subsidence[94] of the\r\nagitation on behalf of the Bonapartist candidate certainly accords ill\r\nwith the alarming reports about the strength of the movement in his\r\nfavour which he had transmitted to Sébastiani. But it would appear\r\nthat when he paid his visit to Paris, at the end of January, he was\r\nhimself deceived by Louis Philippe, and that his promises to the\r\nBelgian deputies, that Nemours would accept the crown, were made under\r\nthe honest impression that the King's objection had been withdrawn.\r\n\"You know the august mouth from which issued my last orders,\" he\r\nwrote to Sébastiani on February 9. \"You heard them. Do not fear,\r\nthey shall remain hidden at the bottom of my heart. But I cannot go\r\nback upon my footsteps. I cannot be the agent of another change of\r\npolicy. I must ask you to replace me. I can sacrifice my interests,\r\nnot my honour.\"[95] \"The painful and difficult situation in which\r\nyou are placed,\" answered Sébastiani, \"is well understood here, but\r\nthe King does full justice to your conduct and to your zeal for his\r\nservice.\"[96]\r\n\r\nOn March 6 Bresson formally transmitted to London his resignation of\r\nthe post of commissioner to the conference and returned to Paris,\r\nbeing replaced at Brussels, as the agent of the French government,\r\nby General Belliard. The rapid advancement which awaited him was to\r\ncompensate him amply for the loss of this appointment. But it was not\r\nalone from foreign governments that Sébastiani received complaints\r\nabout these proceedings at Brussels. Talleyrand expressed the greatest\r\nindignation at the ignorance in which he had been kept of the\r\ninstructions sent to Bresson. The whole affair, he pointed out, had\r\nplaced him in a false position with Palmerston and the ministers of\r\nthe Powers, and had laid him open to the most injurious suspicions.\r\nIt must appear either that he was unacquainted with the intentions of\r\nhis government, or that he was in league with Bresson to deceive the\r\nconference.[97]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Paris had been the scene of disturbances which were\r\nto change completely the course of French policy. On February 14, the\r\nanniversary of the death of the Duc de Berri, the Carlists decided to\r\nhold a memorial service in the church of Saint-Germain-l'Auxerrois.\r\nBut the ceremony was interrupted by a mob, which had collected at the\r\nrumour that a portrait of the Duc de Bordeaux[98] had been crowned.\r\nThe church and the palace of the archbishop were sacked, and much\r\nvaluable and beautiful property was destroyed. The authorities made\r\nonly the feeblest attempts to restrain the rioters, and cast the\r\nwhole blame for the disorder upon the Carlists.[99] Moreover, as a\r\nconcession to the rabble, all crosses were removed from in front of\r\nchurches, the bust of Louis XVIII. was destroyed at the Louvre, and\r\nLouis Philippe even sanctioned the erasure of the lilies from his\r\ncoat of arms. The indignation with which these despicable signs of\r\nweakness were greeted, soon convinced him, however, that he might\r\nwith safety abandon his policy of truckling to the mob. For some time\r\npast, the hopes of all lovers of order had been centred in, Casimir\r\nPérier, as the one man capable of maintaining peace abroad, and of\r\ncombating anarchy at home. Negotiations were accordingly begun, and,\r\non March 14, the _Moniteur_ announced that Laffitte had been replaced\r\nas President of the Council by Casimir Périer, who had, besides,\r\nassumed the duties of Minister of the Interior. With two exceptions\r\nthe members of the new Cabinet had all held office in the Laffitte\r\nadministration. But so little were the rules of the party system\r\nobserved, that they were quite prepared to enter a government, formed\r\nupon principles diametrically opposed to those which had guided the\r\npolicy of the former Cabinet. Casimir Périer was pledged to the stern\r\nrepression of internal disorder, and to the maintenance of external\r\npeace. In addition, he had asked that the King should be absent from\r\nmeetings of the Cabinet--request to which Louis Philippe had given a\r\ngrudging and a qualified assent.[100]\r\n\r\nThe news that M. Casimir Périer had assumed office was received\r\nwith feelings of intense relief at the Courts and in the Cabinets\r\nof Europe.[101] The new President of the Council belonged to a\r\nfamily of high repute in banking and commercial circles. Under the\r\nRestoration he had been an eloquent and much respected member of the\r\nLiberal party. Heinrich Heine, who disliked the French as keenly as\r\nhe admired the English statesman, has declared that Casimir Périer\r\nstrangely resembled George Canning in personal appearance. In both\r\nhe perceived the same expression of \"invalidity, over-excitement and\r\nlassitude.\"[102] Sébastiani's continued retention of the portfolio of\r\nForeign Affairs was also a subject for congratulation. In spite of his\r\nCorsican excitability, he had, upon the whole, won the confidence of\r\nthe ministers with whom he had had business to transact. \"The Dips,\"\r\nwrote Lady Granville to her sister, \"are all pleased that Sébastiani\r\nremains, he is decidedly pacific.\"[103]\r\n\r\nThe state of affairs in Europe, at the time of the formation of\r\nCasimir Périer's government, still bore a most disquieting appearance.\r\nAt the beginning of February, 1831, General Diebitsch entered Poland\r\nat the head of a strong Russian army, and, on the 25th, there was\r\nfought at Grochov one of the fiercest battles of the century, with\r\nresults rather favourable to the Poles. At the same time the Italian\r\nStates were in a condition of acute discontent. The Duke of Modena\r\nhad been compelled to invoke Austrian assistance against his revolted\r\nsubjects, and, on February 5, the _Carbonari_ raised the standard of\r\nrebellion at Bologna. The States of the Pope extended from the Latin\r\ncoast across the Campagna to the marches of Ancona, and, spreading out\r\ninto the plains of Romagna, were bounded by the Po. In the opinion of\r\nChateaubriand,[104] who was ambassador at Rome in 1828, one of the\r\nchief defects of the Papal government lay in the fact that \"old men\r\nappoint an old man, and he in turn makes none but old men cardinals.\"\r\nThis feature of the Pontifical rule seems to have attracted the\r\nattention of Charles Greville[105] when he visited Rome, in 1830. \"The\r\ncardinals,\" he records, \"appear a wretched set of old twaddlers, all\r\nbut about three in extreme decrepitude. On seeing them and knowing\r\nthat the sovereign is elected by and from them, nobody can wonder\r\nthat the country is so miserably governed.\" But it was the doctrine\r\nthat only ecclesiastics could administer a government of divine\r\nappointment which constituted the radical vice of the Papal system.\r\nCardinals ruled over the four Legations of Romagna--Bologna, Ferrara,\r\nRavenna and Forli. Generally speaking, their administration was both\r\nbigoted and corrupt. The finances were constantly in a condition of\r\nhopeless confusion--a circumstance hardly to be wondered at, seeing\r\nthat a prelate in charge of the Exchequer is said to have refused to\r\nstudy political economy, because some of the text books were upon\r\nthe _Index_. The roads were bad, few in number, and infested with\r\nbrigands. Taxation was light, but trade was hampered by customs\r\nbarriers. An arbitrary and interfering police system was supplemented\r\nby the Holy Office of the Inquisition, which still repressed heresy\r\namong Roman subjects, although it did not venture to meddle with\r\nforeigners. Lastly, it was estimated that not more than two _per\r\ncent._ of the population attended school.\r\n\r\nBologna was the most flourishing manufacturing town in the dominions\r\nof His Holiness, and Ancona the only port which could boast of a\r\nreal trade. Probably it was because of their comparative prosperity\r\nthat the people of Romagna were in a chronic state of unrest. The\r\nPontifical troops, sent to suppress the insurrection, quickly proved\r\ntheir inability to carry out the task, and His Holiness appealed to\r\nVienna for assistance. Sébastiani, so soon as he received intelligence\r\nthat this request had been made, instructed Marshal Maison to warn\r\nMetternich that France could not consent to the entry of Austrian\r\ntroops into the Papal States, and, on February 24, he informed Apponyi\r\nin Paris that, in accordance with its principle of non-intervention,\r\nthe French government would regard the passage of the Piedmontese or\r\nRoman frontiers by an Imperial army as a declaration of war.[106]\r\nBut Metternich had already sent off the Comte Athanase d'Otrante, a\r\nson of Fouché, the famous regicide and Minister of Police, to Paris,\r\nwith documents to prove that the Italian insurrections were fomented\r\nby the Bonapartists. It was always in the power of Austria, he\r\npointed out significantly, to put an end to the republican agitation\r\nin Italy, Spain, Germany or France, by simply allowing the Duc de\r\nReichstadt, the heretofore King of Rome, to be proclaimed Emperor\r\nof the French.[107] It was perfectly true that the Bonapartes were\r\nconcerned in the Italian revolutionary movement. Both Prince Charles\r\nand his brother Prince Louis Napoleon held commands in the rebel army\r\nat Civita Castellana. Without doubt this was a circumstance calculated\r\nto induce Louis Philippe to exercise the greatest caution. It was\r\ndecided, accordingly, to despatch the Comte de Sainte-Aulaire to Rome\r\nto urge upon the Papal government the expediency of withdrawing from\r\necclesiastics the administration of the provincial affairs of Romagna,\r\nand of confiding the management of local business to the nobility and\r\nmiddle classes. Maison was to press the Cabinet of Vienna to join\r\nwith France in persuading His Holiness to inaugurate these reforms,\r\nwhilst in London Talleyrand was to seek to obtain the co-operation of\r\nthe British government. Palmerston, who looked upon the condition of\r\nItaly as a perpetual menace to the peace of Europe, readily consented\r\nto instruct Sir Brooke Taylor, the British Minister at Florence, to\r\nproceed to Rome to take part in the conference.[108] Metternich agreed\r\nwith equal alacrity to the French proposals. But it was not his policy\r\nto allow reforms of any kind to be introduced into Italy, and he was\r\nfully resolved that the deliberations should lead to no results of any\r\nconsequence. \"We risk nothing,\" he wrote to Apponyi. . . . \"Count\r\nLützow[109] is a man of character, he knows what is practicable.\"[110]\r\n\r\nBut the good effect of Metternich's consent to confer with the Powers,\r\nupon the condition of affairs, in the Papal States, was dispelled\r\nby a false report which reached Paris of the conclusion of a treaty\r\nbetween Austria and His Holiness. This news was followed, on March\r\n18, by the intelligence that an Imperial army had entered Bologna.\r\nWar, Sébastiani informed Granville, was now inevitable. Nevertheless,\r\nin the evening, when the ambassador read over to him the account of\r\ntheir conversation which he proposed to send to London, he suggested\r\nthat the words \"war was very probable\" should be substituted for his\r\nstatement that \"war was inevitable.\"[111] For the next fortnight the\r\nsituation continued to wear a most critical appearance. At a Cabinet\r\nCouncil, held on March 28, it was resolved to demand the evacuation\r\nof the Papal States, and to ask the Chambers for a vote of credit, to\r\nenable the King to mobilize the army. Casimir Périer,[112] however,\r\nreassured Lord Granville by telling him that the Austrians would\r\nassuredly have crushed the insurrection in Romagna before Maison's\r\ninstructions could reach Vienna, and that the message to the Chambers,\r\nfar from being a measure calculated to bring about war, would, on\r\nthe contrary, assist the King to preserve peace. Were the government\r\nto appear indifferent to the entry of the Austrians into the Papal\r\nStates, the military party would at once raise the cry that ministers\r\nwanted peace at any price. Louis Philippe himself expressed to the\r\nBritish ambassador the greatest confidence that hostilities would\r\nbe avoided. The preservation of the temporal power of the Pope,\r\nhe went on to tell him, was a cardinal feature of French policy.\r\nFive or six millions of his subjects professed the Roman Catholic\r\nreligion,[113] and he was determined to remain upon good terms with\r\nthe head of the Church.[114] The King of Prussia, Lord Granville was\r\nsatisfied, was resolved to take no part in the struggle, should the\r\nAustrian intervention in Italy lead to a collision with France.[115]\r\nHeytesbury, on the other hand, reported that Nicholas, although the\r\ncholera was raging in Russia and notwithstanding that he had still\r\nthe Polish war upon his hands, had announced his determination \"to\r\nbring the whole force of his Empire to the assistance of his Austrian\r\nally.\"[116] But Metternich, in the meanwhile, had empowered Apponyi\r\nto declare that no treaty had been concluded, and to support his\r\nstatement by the production of a copy of His Holiness' appeal for\r\nhelp to the Emperor Francis. Moreover, he promised that the Legations\r\nshould be evacuated \"as soon as they should have been purged of the\r\n_Carbonari_ vermin with which they were infested.\"[117] In effect the\r\nAustrians experienced little difficulty in dispersing the insurgents\r\nand in restoring a semblance of tranquillity in the disturbed\r\ndistricts, whilst at Rome His Holiness undertook to initiate certain\r\nreforms, in accordance with the spirit of the proposals which the\r\nwestern Powers urged him to adopt. By July 17 the complete withdrawal\r\nof the Imperial troops from the territories of the Pope had been\r\ncarried out.\r\n\r\nThe effect of Casimir Périer's assumption of office upon the course\r\nof the Belgian negotiations was soon apparent. Nothing more was\r\nheard of the candidature of Prince Charles of Naples. \"As a member of\r\nthe elder branch of the Bourbons, France,\" wrote Sébastiani, \"would\r\nreject him with indignation.\"[118] Under these circumstances the\r\nFrench government decided to exert its influence in favour of Leopold\r\nof Coburg, although his enthronement, Louis Philippe assured Lord\r\nGranville, would not be well received in France. He will be looked\r\nupon as an English viceroy, but, insinuated the King, the nation\r\ncould be reconciled to the choice of this prince, were it possible\r\nto announce that those portions of her northern territory, of which\r\nshe had been deprived by the treaties of 1815, were to be restored to\r\nFrance.[119]\r\n\r\nLeopold, the youngest son of Francis Duke of Coburg, was born in\r\n1790. On May 2, 1816, he married the only daughter of George IV., the\r\nPrincess Charlotte, who died the following year, five hours after\r\ngiving birth to a dead child. As a widower, the Prince continued to\r\nlive in England in enjoyment of the pension of £50,000 a year which\r\nParliament had settled upon him for life. In 1829 he was chosen\r\nby the Powers for the throne of Greece, but, after signifying his\r\nacceptation of the crown, he saw fit to change his mind, alleging\r\nthat the frontiers, which the conference purposed to impose upon the\r\nnew State, were regarded as unsatisfactory by the Greek nation. There\r\nwould appear to have been good reasons for his withdrawal, but it,\r\nnevertheless, caused the greatest annoyance to the Tories who were\r\nthen in office. The Whigs, although less bitter against the _Marquis\r\nPeu-à-Peu_, as George IV. nicknamed him, had certainly no very high\r\nopinion of his ability to fill a difficult position.[120] It was\r\nclear, however, that all hope must be abandoned of inducing the\r\nBelgians to accept the Prince of Orange for their King. This Prince\r\nhad been spending the winter in London where, according to Greville,\r\n\"he made a great fool of himself and destroyed any sympathy there\r\nmight have been for his political misfortunes.\"[121] In the words\r\nof Talleyrand, Palmerston was, in consequence, prepared to accept\r\n\"_sans chaleur_,\"[122] the candidature of Leopold of Coburg, whilst\r\nmaintaining that, before electing their Sovereign, the Belgians must\r\nadhere to the 11th and 12th protocols, which laid down the conditions\r\nunder which their country was to be separated from Holland.[123]\r\n\r\nOn April 17 Talleyrand was in a position to announce to the conference\r\nthat France now gave her unqualified assent to the proposed terms of\r\nseparation. On this occasion it was resolved, at the suggestion of\r\nthe French plenipotentiary, that, should Belgium decline to adhere\r\nto the conditions in question, which the King of the Netherlands had\r\naccepted, all relations should be broken off between the five Powers\r\nand the Belgian authorities. To prove the satisfaction which this\r\nchanged attitude on the part of the French government afforded them\r\nthe plenipotentiaries of Austria, Prussia, Russia and Great Britain\r\nmet, and recorded their agreement to the principle of the destruction\r\nof the barrier fortresses, the protocol of this conference of the four\r\nPowers being communicated in confidence to Talleyrand.[124]\r\n\r\nThe question of the nature of the coercion which should be applied\r\nto the Belgians, should they persist in laying claim to Luxemburg,\r\nwas not easy of solution. The Grand Duchy formed part of the Germanic\r\nConfederation, and therefore it should have devolved upon the Federal\r\nDiet to take the steps required for restoring the sovereignty of the\r\nKing of the Netherlands. Sébastiani, however, deprecated the idea of\r\nemploying German troops for the purpose of enforcing the decisions\r\nof the conference. But on the understanding that both the strength\r\nof the contingent, which was to enter Belgium, and the date on which\r\nthe military operations were to begin should be settled by the five\r\nPowers, the French government withdrew its objections.[125] Prince\r\nLeopold, at the same time, informed the members of the deputation,\r\nwho had come to London to offer him the crown of Belgium, that he\r\ncould not listen to their proposals, until the national congress\r\nshould have accepted the conditions of the 11th and 12th protocols.\r\nNo persuasion could move him from this resolution which met with the\r\nfull approval of the British government. Talleyrand, however, as a\r\ncompromise appears to have suggested the plan of proposing to the\r\nKing of the Netherlands the cession of the province of Luxemburg,\r\nwithout the fortress, in return for a pecuniary indemnity.[126]\r\nThis solution of the difficulty was considered so practicable by\r\nLord Ponsonby that, upon his own responsibility, he left Brussels\r\nand journeyed to London to urge its adoption. The conference, in\r\nconsequence of his representations, agreed to open negotiations\r\nwith the King of the Netherlands for the purchase of Luxemburg and\r\nfor \"so much of the province of Limburg as would connect Maëstricht\r\nwith North Brabant.\"[127] But when June 1, the date which had been\r\nassigned as that on which the Belgians must signify their agreement\r\nto _les bases de separation_, went by without a favourable answer\r\nhaving been received from Brussels, the conference withdrew Ponsonby\r\nand decided to resort to measures of coercion. The action of the\r\nnational congress, in electing Prince Leopold King of the Belgians on\r\nJune 4, had no effect upon the decision of the Powers. \"It has been\r\nused,\" wrote Palmerston, \"as a fresh opportunity for putting forward\r\npretensions to portions of the territory of the King of Holland and\r\nby implication, at least, of repeating their determination to gain\r\npossession of them by force.\"[128]\r\n\r\nBut, as the moment approached for setting in motion General Hinüber's\r\nFederal _corps d'armée_, the French government evinced symptoms\r\nof alarm. Sébastiani begged Talleyrand to try by all means in his\r\npower to discover some less objectionable method of terminating\r\nthe difficulty. The King and his ministers, he assured him, placed\r\ntheir entire trust in his wisdom and vast experience.[129] Casimir\r\nPérier impressed upon Lord Granville that he would be powerless to\r\nrestrain the army, were the Prussians and the Dutch to attack the\r\nBelgians \"ranged under the tricolour.\" \"Sufficient allowance,\" he\r\npleaded, \"was not made for the weakness of a government sprung from a\r\nrevolution.\"[130] Talleyrand, however, reported that, in spite of his\r\nefforts and of those of Prince Leopold to make the Belgians listen\r\nto reason, they refused obstinately to accept the conditions imposed\r\nupon them. At the Hague there was, he believed, a keen desire to bring\r\non a general war, whilst the Tsar Nicholas was not sorry that the\r\nattention of the western Powers should be diverted from Poland to the\r\nLow Countries. In England men's minds were concentrated exclusively\r\nupon the Reform Bill, and the knowledge that France and Great Britain\r\nwere confronted by grave domestic problems undoubtedly encouraged\r\nthe Belgians to defy the conference. Under these circumstances, his\r\nfavourite scheme, the partition of the country, appeared to him the\r\nonly practicable solution of the question. But on this occasion the\r\nidea of acquiring some part of Belgium offered no attractions to the\r\nFrench government. \"We are disposed to think,\" answered Sébastiani,\r\n\"that any partition would recall that of Poland, and would not be\r\npopular.\"[131]\r\n\r\nThe determination of the Powers to impose by force of arms the terms\r\nof the protocols of January 20 and 27 was, however, growing weaker.\r\nIn their desire to avoid a general war they agreed to depart from a\r\ndecision, which they had once pronounced to be irrevocable. The event\r\nwas to prove that by this concession they had sensibly increased the\r\ndanger of that armed conflict between the nations, which they were so\r\nanxious to avert. At the sitting of the conference, on June 26, the\r\nplenipotentiaries, \"in the interests of the general peace,\" affixed\r\ntheir signatures to a protocol of eighteen articles for acceptance\r\nby Holland and Belgium.[132] The altered conditions, although they\r\ndid not fulfil all their aspirations, were far more favourable to the\r\nBelgians than the terms of the former _bases de_ _séparation_. The\r\nmost important modification consisted in a provision for maintaining\r\na _status quo_ in Luxemburg, pending the negotiations which were to\r\nbe carried out between Belgium, on the one hand, and Holland and\r\nthe Germanic Confederation, on the other. Prince Leopold, when the\r\nprotocol of the eighteen articles was laid before him, agreed to\r\naccept the crown provided, always, that the national congress could\r\nbe brought to assent to the new conditions which it set forth. After\r\nseveral stormy debates in the assembly this stipulation was complied\r\nwith, and on July 11, a deputation arrived in London to conduct the\r\nKing to Belgium.\r\n\r\nLeopold had been assured that, even should the King of the Netherlands\r\ndecline to accept the eighteen articles, the Powers would none the\r\nless recognize him as the Sovereign of Belgium. But, when the refusal\r\nof King William was known in London, the plenipotentiaries of Austria,\r\nPrussia and Russia declared that their respective governments had\r\ndecided to withhold their recognition of him. Leopold, however, wisely\r\ndetermined to adhere to his resolution and to be satisfied with the\r\nacknowledgment of France and Great Britain. Before finally leaving\r\nLondon he informed Lord Grey of his intention to renounce his English\r\npension. Claremont was to be kept up and all his debts were to be\r\npaid, but, when these conditions had been fulfilled, his trustees\r\nwould pay the balance of his annuity into the English exchequer.\r\nHis decision to act in this manner was quickened, without doubt,\r\nby learning that in the House of Lords, Londonderry, an Opposition\r\npeer, purposed to raise the question of his retention of his English\r\npension.[133]\r\n\r\nDuring the month of July an affair of some delicacy was amicably\r\nsettled between the Cabinets of London and Paris. For some time\r\npast the government of M. Périer had been trying to obtain redress\r\nfor the indignities to which French subjects, especially those\r\nsuspected of affiliation to masonic lodges, were exposed in Portugal.\r\nPalmerston admitted the justice of the French complaints and raised no\r\nobjections when it was proposed to send a fleet to Lisbon to demand\r\nsatisfaction.[134] On July 8, accordingly, Admiral Roussin forced the\r\nentrance to the Tagus and ranged his squadron within gunshot of the\r\nquays of Lisbon. The Portuguese government, under these circumstances,\r\nwas compelled to accede to the demands which the admiral had been\r\ninstructed to make, and the French fleet, shortly afterwards,\r\nwithdrew, carrying off with it, however, several Portuguese vessels of\r\nwar. But, although the affair gave rise to no complications between\r\nEngland and France, it was seized upon by an embittered Opposition in\r\nLondon, as an opportunity for denouncing the failure of the government\r\nto protect England's \"most ancient ally.\"[135]\r\n\r\nThe refusal of the King of the Netherlands to accept the new\r\nconditions of separation, as defined in the protocol of the eighteen\r\narticles, was communicated to the conference by the Dutch minister,\r\nVerstolk. The despatch, dated July 12, 1831, concluded with the menace\r\nthat, \"were any Prince to accept the crown of Belgium without having\r\nacceded to _les bases de séparation_ as laid down in the protocol of\r\nJanuary 20, he would be regarded as in a state of war with His Majesty\r\nand as his enemy.\"[136] The representatives of the Powers appear to\r\nhave treated these ominous words very lightly. An intimation was\r\nconveyed to the Hague that hostilities must not break out afresh, but\r\nno active measures were taken to prevent a rupture of the peace. It\r\nwas soon evident, however, that the King was fully resolved to put\r\nhis threat into execution. On August 1, Chassé, the Dutch general\r\ncommanding the citadel of Antwerp, denounced the armistice and gave\r\nnotice that hostilities would begin on the 4th. Leopold at once\r\nappealed for help to France and England, and then placed himself at\r\nthe head of a wing of his army upon the Scheldt. But the retreat of\r\nGeneral Daine, commanding the Belgian division upon the Meuse, who\r\nabandoned his positions without firing a shot, compelled the King to\r\nfall back to Louvain. Here he made his dispositions for withstanding\r\nthe Dutch inroad, but, in spite of the gallant example which he set\r\nhis men, his army, at the first contact with the enemy, fled in wild\r\nconfusion. In the meantime, however, Marshal Gérard had entered\r\nBelgium in command of 50,000 French troops, and, when Leopold was\r\nupon the point of being surrounded, Sir Robert Adair, the British\r\nminister at Brussels, prevailed upon the Prince of Orange to suspend\r\nhostilities. The Dutch, shortly afterwards, began their retreat\r\nclosely followed by the French, and, by August 20, the last of the\r\ninvaders had evacuated the territory of Belgium.\r\n\r\nIt had been an easy matter to bring the actual hostilities to a close,\r\nbut the Dutch raid had none the less created precisely that situation\r\nwhich British diplomacy had always striven to avoid. The French were\r\nnow in complete possession of Belgium. Palmerston, indeed, strongly\r\nsuspected them of having instigated the King of the Netherlands to\r\nbreak the peace. Sir Richard Bagot, the British ambassador at the\r\nHague, inclined to the belief that a secret understanding existed\r\nbetween the Dutch and French governments. \"Talleyrand,\" wrote\r\nPalmerston in a private letter to Granville, \"proposed to me some time\r\nago that we should goad the Dutch on to break the armistice, cry\r\nout shame upon them, fly to the aid of the Belgians, cover Belgium\r\nwith troops and settle everything as we choose.\" \"It would seem,\"\r\nreported Granville, \"that the King of Holland rather expected from the\r\nFrench government approbation than opposition to his invasion.\"[137]\r\nIt is not improbable that the Cabinet of the Hague may have been\r\nled to believe that a rupture of the armistice would meet with\r\napproval in Paris. But, in order to have furthered French designs,\r\nit should have taken place at an earlier date. Talleyrand's proposal\r\nto Palmerston, it is clear, must have been made in June, when he was\r\ntelling Sébastiani that he could devise no other plan for settling\r\nthe question of Belgium but that of partition. Once Leopold had been\r\nenthroned, however, he knew full well that no British government\r\ncould acquiesce in the appropriation by France of any portion of his\r\nkingdom. The Dutch invasion, which might have served French policy,\r\nhad it occurred whilst matters were still unsettled in Belgium, became\r\nsimply an embarrassment and a certain cause of discord between France\r\nand England, after Leopold's arrival at Brussels.[138] Talleyrand,\r\ntherefore, who regarded the maintenance of cordial relations between\r\nthe two countries as an object of far higher importance that any\r\nextension of French frontiers into Belgium, strove by all means in\r\nhis power to second the efforts of the British government to bring\r\nthe French occupation to a close as speedily as possible. But, whilst\r\nPalmerston attributed to French intrigues the Dutch attack upon\r\nBelgium, he himself was suspected by Stockmar[139] of having known of\r\nthe King of Holland's plans and of having connived at the invasion. A\r\nfew weeks later, however, when in London upon a confidential mission,\r\nLeopold's trusted counsellor satisfied himself that Palmerston was\r\nwholly innocent of any double dealing in the affair.\r\n\r\nCasimir Périer had been on the point of resigning, in consequence of\r\nthe defeat of the ministerial candidate for the post of President of\r\nthe Chamber, when the news reached Paris of the Dutch inroad into\r\nBelgium. This new development at once caused him to change his plans\r\nand to decide to remain in office. Talleyrand was instructed to\r\nexplain in London that it was only the necessity for immediate action\r\nwhich had induced the French government to order a French corps to\r\nenter Belgium, without previous consultation with the Powers. Lord\r\nGranville, at the same time, was informed that, upon the withdrawal of\r\nthe Dutch, the French troops would return to France.[140] The news of\r\nthe French intervention in Belgium aroused great excitement in London.\r\nThe funds fell, and Palmerston was sharply questioned upon the matter\r\nin the House.[141] Ministers, however, reassured by the accounts of\r\nthe intentions of the French government transmitted by Granville, took\r\na cheerful view of the situation.[142] At a sitting of the conference,\r\non August 6, Talleyrand announced that Marshal Gérard's occupation of\r\nBelgium would cease directly the Dutch should evacuate the country.\r\nOn this same occasion it was agreed that the scope of the French\r\noperations should be decided by the conference and that, under no\r\ncircumstances, should they be extended to the right bank of the Meuse.\r\nIt was further resolved that siege should not be laid to either\r\nMaëstricht or Venlo, on account of their proximity to the Prussian\r\nfrontier.[143]\r\n\r\nBut, when the Dutch withdrew and the French showed no disposition to\r\nfollow their example, the affair began to assume a very different\r\ncomplexion. Sébastiani, changing his ground completely, declared that\r\nMarshal Gérard's occupation must continue until the conclusion of a\r\ndefinite treaty of peace between Holland and Belgium. In the Chamber,\r\nSoult, the Minister of War, stated explicitly that the retreat of the\r\nDutch did not entail the evacuation of Belgium by the French army.\r\nThe unfavourable impression created by these words was not removed\r\nby Casimir Périer's promise to Lord Granville, that he would say\r\nsomething from the tribune calculated to diminish the importance of\r\nthe Marshal's pronouncement. Sébastiani's conversations with the\r\nBritish ambassador, and the reports forwarded by Adair from Brussels\r\nmade it too clear that the French government purposed to avail itself\r\nof the presence of its troops in Belgium for coming to a separate\r\nagreement with King Leopold, respecting the immediate destruction of\r\nthe frontier fortresses. This was an arrangement which the Cabinet of\r\nLord Grey was determined to oppose, even to the point of war.[144]\r\n\r\nTalleyrand, as was his invariable practise in these disputes between\r\nFrance and England, left no stone unturned to dissuade his government\r\nfrom embarking upon a course of conduct destined inevitably to revive\r\nthe old rivalry between the two countries. Were France to break her\r\nword and to retain her troops in Belgium, he was convinced that\r\nLord Grey and his colleagues would be driven from office and their\r\nsuccessors would be men far less well disposed towards France.\r\nPalmerston, he wrote, was assailed by questions in the House and\r\nmust before long make some definite statement. Sébastiani, in reply,\r\nexpressed regret for the difficulties by which Lord Grey was beset,\r\nbut maintained that the French government, were it to allow the army\r\nto return home empty handed, would be confronted by a still more\r\nunpleasant situation. Talleyrand, however, might announce that, in\r\nconsequence of the retirement of the Dutch, 20,000 of Marshal Gérard's\r\ntroops would be recalled and that the remaining 30,000 would be\r\nconcentrated at Nivelle.[145] The news of this partial evacuation\r\ncaused much satisfaction in London, but none the less Palmerston, on\r\nAugust 17, instructed Lord Granville formally to demand the complete\r\nwithdrawal of the French army corps. He was directed to remind the\r\nFrench government of its pledges and to point out that, by the\r\nprotocol of April 17, the four Powers had agreed to the principle\r\nof the destruction of the frontier fortresses, \"the satisfactory\r\nexecution of which arrangement could only be impeded by any measures\r\nhaving the appearance of making the protracted occupation of Belgium\r\nby the French army bear upon it. . . .\" He was to speak \"in terms\r\nof friendship and goodwill, enforcing at the same time the just\r\nexpectations of His Majesty with firmness and decision.\"[146]\r\n\r\nOn August 23 the conference decided to impose an armistice upon\r\nthe Dutch and Belgians, to expire on October 10.[147] The French\r\ngovernment, however, declared that a mere undertaking by the King of\r\nthe Netherlands, not to begin hostilities afresh, could not provide a\r\nguarantee for the maintenance of peace of sufficient weight to permit\r\nof the complete withdrawal of the French army. General Baudrand,\r\nmoreover, was sent to London with a letter from Louis Philippe to\r\nTalleyrand, in which the King expressed his displeasure with his\r\naction in signing a document of that nature. Baudrand during his\r\nstay in England had interviews both with Grey and Palmerston.[148]\r\nHe appears to have expatiated upon the outcry which would be raised\r\nin the Chamber, were France to gain neither moral nor material\r\nadvantages, in return for the expense to which she had been put by her\r\nintervention in aid of the King of the Belgians. Palmerston assured\r\nhim that his colleagues and himself were sincerely anxious that M.\r\nCasimir Périer should remain in office, but, he added pointedly,\r\n\"when to keep in a ministry of peace it became necessary to comply\r\nwith the demands of the party which was for war, it was problematical\r\nwhat decree of advantage was thereby to be acquired.\"[149] Talleyrand\r\nappears to have been little moved by the censure passed upon him. He\r\ncontended that he had acted for the best, and that no fears need be\r\nentertained that the Dutch would again attack Belgium. At the same\r\ntime he continued to urge the necessity of bringing the occupation\r\nof Belgium to a close. \"There is more real anxiety over here than I\r\nhave yet seen,\" he wrote on August 27. \"People are all talking of an\r\ninterview between the Duke of Wellington and Lord Grey.\" A few days\r\nlater he again pleaded earnestly for evacuation, suggesting that the\r\nwithdrawal of the troops might be carried out so slowly that some\r\nportion of them should still be in Belgium, at the expiration of the\r\narmistice.[150]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime General La Tour-Maubourg had arrived at Brussels,\r\non August 18, furnished with the draft of a treaty which he was to\r\nconclude with the Belgian government for the destruction of the\r\nbarrier fortresses. In the first instance it was probably intended\r\nto keep his mission a secret, but different counsels seem to have\r\nprevailed, and, a few days after his departure, Sébastiani informed\r\nGranville of the reason of this officer's journey to Brussels. France,\r\nhe told the British ambassador, claimed the right to negotiate with\r\nregard to the fortresses and it was hoped that powers would be given\r\nto Sir Robert Adair to act with La Tour-Maubourg in the matter. This\r\nrequest, when in due course Granville transmitted it to London, was\r\nrefused. Palmerston, in a long interview with Talleyrand, had already\r\ndeclared, in the most uncompromising language, that the pretensions of\r\nthe French government to have a voice in determining the fate of these\r\nfortresses, erected at the expense of Great Britain, Russia, Austria\r\nand Prussia, could not be entertained.[151] Immediately on hearing of\r\nLa Tour-Maubourg's arrival at Brussels Sir Robert Adair, guessing the\r\nobject of his mission, sought an audience with Leopold. Both to the\r\nKing and to Meulinäer, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, he asserted\r\nemphatically that his government could never admit that the withdrawal\r\nof Gérard's troops could be made to depend upon the conclusion of an\r\narrangement between France and Belgium, respecting the fortresses.[152]\r\n\r\nLeopold was in a most difficult situation. Although he had\r\ninvoked the assistance of France and England the moment the Dutch\r\nhad announced their intention of beginning hostilities, he had\r\nonly invited Marshal Gérard actually to cross the frontier when\r\nthe misconduct of General Daine had seriously compromised his\r\nposition.[153] He appears to have greatly distrusted the intentions\r\nof the French and to have proposed that England should occupy Antwerp\r\nin the name of the five Powers. Three days later, however, he desired\r\nSir Robert Adair to consider this suggestion as withdrawn, stating\r\nthat he was satisfied with Belliard's assurances that the French\r\nwould withdraw, as soon as the Dutch should have effected their\r\nretreat.[154] After the retirement of the Prince of Orange he was\r\npressed, on the one side, by Sir Robert Adair to declare that he no\r\nlonger required the presence of the French for his protection, whilst,\r\non the other hand, General Belliard urged him no less vigorously to\r\ninvite Marshal Gérard to remain in Belgium. Without doubt he was in\r\na most cruel dilemma. He had no army worthy of the name, and was at\r\nthe mercy of the Dutch should they return to the attack. Moreover,\r\nhe had every reason to apprehend that the Republican and Orangist\r\nfactions would regard the disturbed condition, to which the invasion\r\nhad reduced the country, as a favourable opportunity for putting their\r\ndesigns into execution. Against the external and internal perils by\r\nwhich he was threatened he could only look for active assistance to\r\nthe French. England was very jealous of French intervention in the\r\nLow Countries, but he had no grounds for supposing that Lord Grey\r\nwould stir a finger to defend him from a rebellion of his subjects.\r\nThe British government, indeed, had declined to send the fleet to the\r\nmouth of the Scheldt. The desire to afford the French no pretext\r\nfor remaining in Belgium undoubtedly dictated this refusal, which\r\nnevertheless increased Stockmar's distrust of Palmerston's policy.\r\nAdair soon discovered that, in his endeavours to obtain the speedy\r\ndeparture of the French, he could expect no assistance from Leopold.\r\nHe could discern, he reported, no sense of shame nor of humiliation in\r\nthe attitude of ministers or of the people generally. They appeared to\r\nregard the presence of Marshal Gérard's troops simply as a means of\r\nextorting better terms from the Dutch.[155]\r\n\r\nWhen Palmerston was informed of La Tour-Maubourg's mission he at once\r\ndirected Adair to remonstrate against any separate negotiation between\r\nFrance and Belgium, on the question of the fortresses. But his first\r\ninterview with Meulinäer, after the receipt of his instructions,\r\nconvinced Adair that \"this delicate matter had already proceeded so\r\nfar that no choice was left to him except to object _in toto_ to every\r\nsort of communication on the subject.\" A solution of the difficulty\r\nwas discovered, however, in a suggestion, brought forward by the\r\nBritish minister, that \"the King of the Belgians should declare to\r\nthe King of the French, through M. de La Tour-Maubourg, that he was\r\ntaking measures, in concert with Great Britain, Austria, Russia and\r\nPrussia, for the demolition of some of the fortresses erected since\r\n1815.\" A few days later Adair was informed that General Goblet would\r\nbe despatched to London to negotiate a convention, whilst Leopold, on\r\nSeptember 8, affixed his signature to a document, wherein he undertook\r\nto instruct his plenipotentiary to act in accordance with the wishes\r\nof the French government in the matter of the selection of the\r\nfortresses to be dismantled.[156]\r\n\r\nBut in Paris the ambassadors of the four Powers had protested formally\r\nagainst the protracted occupation of Belgium by a French army.\r\nPalmerston, in forwarding to Granville a memorandum of the points he\r\nwas to urge in his conference with Sébastiani, directed that this\r\ndocument \"was not to be handed to that minister as a note, but that\r\nit was to be read to him confidentially . . . a course which has been\r\nadopted out of delicacy, and under the conviction that we shall hear\r\nin a few days that the French government has, of its own accord, given\r\norders for the evacuation of Belgium.\"[157] These representations\r\nobtained the desired effect. At Brussels Leopold suddenly discovered\r\nthat the presence of Marshal Gérard's soldiers were no longer\r\nnecessary for his safety.[158] The announcement in the _Moniteur_,\r\nof September 15, of the ministerial decision to recall the army from\r\nBelgium was the signal for a violent outburst in the newspapers\r\nagainst the poltroonery of the government, in yielding to the\r\ndictation of the conference.[159] In London satisfaction at the French\r\nwithdrawal was marred by the publication of a long list of officers,\r\nappointed by Marshal Soult, to inspect and organize the Belgian army.\r\nThis circumstance was seized upon by the Opposition as an opportunity\r\nfor attacking the foreign policy of the government. The Reform Bill\r\nwas before the House of Lords and party spirit was running high. \"King\r\nLeopold's intention to employ French officers in his army,\" declared\r\nLord Londonderry, \"was more prejudicial to his independence than\r\nthe retention of 12,000 French troops in Belgium.\" His Lordship then\r\nproceeded to review Talleyrand's career, and to asperse his conduct,\r\nunder the various _régimes_ which he had served, with a virulence of\r\nlanguage which has never since been used in that dignified assembly\r\nabout the ambassador of a friendly Power. \"There was a flirtation,\" he\r\nasserted amidst much laughter, \"going on between the government and\r\nFrance which he thought most improper. . . . To see ministers running\r\nto consult with that individual (Talleyrand) was creating a disgust\r\nwhich he thought most natural.\" The Duke of Wellington, however, spoke\r\nup strongly for Talleyrand. In the many transactions upon which they\r\nhad been engaged together, he assured the House that the Prince had\r\nalways conducted himself with honour and uprightness. \"He believed\r\nthat no man's public and private character had been so much maligned\r\nas that of that illustrious individual.\"[160] Talleyrand was deeply\r\nmoved by the Duke's conduct on this occasion. \"He was especially\r\ngrateful to him,\" he told Lord Alvanley, who the next day found him\r\nperusing an account of the debate, \"because he was the only public man\r\nin the world who had ever said a good word for him.\"[161]\r\n\r\nFollowing closely upon the announcement that the French government had\r\nagreed to evacuate Belgium came the intelligence of the defeat of the\r\nPoles and of the entry of the Russians into Warsaw. The news was the\r\nsignal for the outbreak of disturbances in Paris. Sébastiani's famous\r\nstatement to the Chamber \"_l'ordre règne à Varsovie_,\" was denounced\r\nwith indignation by the demagogues. Both he and Casimir Périer were\r\nsurrounded by a furious mob upon the Place Vendôme, and were for a\r\ntime in no little danger. The rioters interrupted the performances at\r\nthe theatres, crying out that all places of amusement must be closed\r\non a day of mourning. The marked reluctance of the national guards\r\nto act against their fellow-citizens imparted a serious aspect to\r\nthe situation. But the regular troops retained their discipline and\r\ndispersed the rabble.[162] At the first outbreak of the rebellion\r\nin Poland the French government had sought to induce England to\r\njoin with it in a proposal to mediate between the Emperor and his\r\nrevolted subjects. Talleyrand, however, who was always disposed to\r\ncreate difficulties for Russia, was obliged to report regretfully\r\nthat British ministers were extremely averse to embarking upon any\r\ndiplomatic action calculated to add to the Tsar's embarrassments.[163]\r\n\r\nIn March, 1831, a false report had reached London and Paris of the\r\ntotal defeat of the Poles, whereupon Sébastiani again instructed\r\nTalleyrand to urge, in the most pressing language, the British\r\ngovernment to unite with France in insisting upon the humane treatment\r\nof the rebels. Palmerston, believing the insurrection to be at an\r\nend, readily promised to direct Lord Heytesbury to support the\r\nrepresentations upon their behalf which the Duc de Mortemart had been\r\nenjoined to make at St. Petersburg.[164] Heytesbury, accordingly,\r\nintimated to Count Nesselrode that, were any measures to be adopted\r\ntowards Poland at variance with existing engagements, both Great\r\nBritain and France would be under the necessity of remonstrating\r\nformally. The Kingdom of Poland, it should be remembered, had been\r\nconstituted in 1815 under the guarantee of the five Powers, and it\r\nwas, in consequence, possible to contend, with some show of reason,\r\nthat all of them were equally concerned in the maintenance of the\r\nliberties conceded to the Poles, under the terms of the Vienna\r\ntreaty. Heytesbury's conversations with Count Nesselrode convinced\r\nhim, however, that, although the letter of that agreement might be\r\nobserved, the Polish constitution would be virtually abolished. But,\r\nin reporting the nature of the intentions by which he conceived\r\nthe Russian government to be animated, the able and experienced\r\ndiplomatist who then represented Great Britain at St. Petersburg was\r\nat pains to point out the difficulties of the Tsar's position. In\r\nRussia there was a strong public opinion which even the autocratic\r\nNicholas could not afford to disregard. Were former conditions to\r\nbe restored in Poland, and were the authors of the cold-blooded\r\nassassinations at Warsaw to be permitted to escape unpunished,\r\ngreat indignation would be aroused throughout the Empire. His\r\nrepresentations had been well received, but he was plainly allowed to\r\nsee how deeply the St. Petersburg Cabinet regretted the existence of\r\nthe close understanding between France and England, which his action\r\nhad revealed. He could perceive clearly from the demeanour of his\r\nAustrian and Prussian colleagues that neither the Court of Vienna nor\r\nof Berlin would be disposed to interfere upon behalf of the Poles.\r\nFrance not Russia, he pointed out, was now looked upon as an object of\r\ncommon danger.[165]\r\n\r\nFrench sympathy for the Poles was so keen that, in July, Talleyrand\r\nwas again instructed to invite the English government to join with\r\nFrance in proposing \"a mediation in the bloody struggle raging in\r\nPoland.\" Palmerston, in reply, appears to have suggested that the\r\nFrench government should set forth its views upon the matter in\r\nwriting. Talleyrand, accordingly, transmitted this request and,\r\nat the same time, begged Sébastiani to remember, when framing his\r\nproposals, that \"he was dealing with cold-blooded people and that\r\nit would be well therefore to avoid the use of emotional language.\"\r\nBut, on July 22, Palmerston informed him that the Cabinet could not\r\nentertain the suggestion of addressing to Russia any demand for a\r\ncessation of hostilities, nor was he able to report better success\r\nwhen, in September, whilst the Belgian difficulty was at its height,\r\nhe was once more directed to approach the British government upon the\r\nsubject of Poland. \"No party in the Parliament,\" he wrote, \"was in\r\nfavour of intervention, and the newspapers merely spoke of the Poles\r\nin sympathetic language.\"[166] Heytesbury, who at St. Petersburg was\r\nin a position to judge correctly of the national resentment which\r\nany attempt at foreign interference in Polish affairs would create,\r\nstrove to convince his government of the unwisdom of impairing the\r\ngood relations of Russia and England by raising a question in which\r\nno British interests were involved. Remonstrances, he was prepared to\r\nadmit, might effect an improvement in the condition of the people of\r\nthe Kingdom of Poland. But, even under these circumstances, the sum of\r\nhuman misery, which the rebellion must entail, would not be lessened,\r\ninasmuch as the revolted Russo-Polish provinces, not included in the\r\nKingdom, would be treated with increased severity.[167]\r\n\r\nBut, with the complete suppression of the insurrection, Lord Grey\r\nand his colleagues assumed a more sympathetic attitude towards the\r\nvanquished Poles. In a closely reasoned despatch Palmerston, on\r\nNovember 23, formulated the arguments which Heytesbury was instructed\r\nto press upon the Cabinet of St. Petersburg. The most important\r\npassage in this long document was that in which the interpretation\r\nwas set forth which the English government placed upon the wording\r\nof the treaty of Vienna. The futility of the plea that no specific\r\nconstitution had been guaranteed to Poland, a contention which\r\nHeytesbury had warned his chief the Russian government would certainly\r\nset up, was clearly exposed. \"Surely,\" wrote Palmerston, \"it was\r\nno forced construction of the meaning of the treaty to consider\r\nthe constitution, which the Emperor had given, as existing under\r\nthe sanction of the treaty.\" The constitution contained no clause\r\nreserving to the Sovereign the right of modifying its provisions. The\r\naction of the Poles in declaring themselves separated from Russia\r\ncould not be held to absolve the Emperor from adhering to his compact.\r\n\"Wrongs committed by one side,\" he concluded, \"were not to be punished\r\nby the commission of wrongs on the other.\"[168]\r\n\r\nHeytesbury, after prefacing his disagreeable task of communicating\r\nthese instructions by assurances that his government was only desirous\r\nof tendering friendly advice to a former ally, proceeded to read\r\nout to Count Nesselrode Lord Palmerston's despatch. \"The Count,\"\r\nhe reported, \"listened with great attention and in silence, but\r\nhis silence was not the silence of assent.\" The Russian Chancellor\r\nexpressed his regret that the British government should have seen\r\nfit to make representations of this nature, notwithstanding the\r\nintimation, conveyed to it by Prince Lieven, that the Tsar could not\r\nadmit of foreign interference in the Polish question. The official\r\nanswer of the Imperial Cabinet was in due course communicated to\r\nPalmerston by the Russian ambassador. As Heytesbury had foreseen,\r\nNicholas, \"strong in the support of Austria and Prussia and in the\r\nunanimous approbation of the Russian nation,\"[169] refused to adopt\r\nthe interpretation of the treaty which it was desired to place upon it\r\nin London and in Paris.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, important progress had been made towards a settlement\r\nof the Belgian question. At the end of August, Baron Stockmar,\r\nLeopold's confidential adviser, proceeded to London to watch over\r\nhis interests in conjunction with Van de Weyer, the Belgian minister\r\nat the Court of St. James'. Stockmar realized speedily that the\r\nBelgians would have to suffer for the defeat inflicted upon them by\r\nthe Dutch. In the treaty of peace and separation, which the conference\r\nwas resolved must be concluded without delay, they could not hope to\r\nobtain the favourable terms conceded to them in the convention of\r\nthe eighteen articles. Should they refuse to agree to the necessary\r\nconcessions, Palmerston warned him that the conference would be\r\nbroken up, and the King of Holland would be left free to fight out\r\nhis quarrel with Leopold. Stockmar, however, continually impressed\r\nupon his master that this was a threat which he could safely afford\r\nto disregard. The French had always considered the union of Holland\r\nand Belgium and the creation of the Kingdom of the Netherlands as a\r\ndiplomatic combination directed against them. Public opinion in France\r\nmight, therefore, be depended upon to compel the government to resist\r\nany attempt on the part of the Dutch to reconstitute the kingdom by\r\nforce of arms. But, although he admitted that Leopold could only\r\nexpect active assistance from France, Stockmar strongly deprecated\r\nthe idea of using French intervention as a means of intimidating the\r\nconference. Such a course, he was convinced, would simply incline\r\nthe four Powers to lean all the more towards Holland. Lords Grey and\r\nPalmerston were well disposed, but they had to reckon with national\r\nsentiment, which was more favourable to \"England's ancient allies,\"\r\nthe Dutch, than to the Belgians. Nevertheless, although the British\r\ngovernment might be unable to render him practical assistance,\r\nLeopold, Stockmar considered, should strive to gain its moral support.\r\nThe prolonged occupation of Belgium by the French was to be deplored,\r\nbecause it engendered the suspicion in London that the King was\r\nover-anxious to place himself under the protection of France. In\r\norder effectually to put a check upon both Dutch and French intrigues\r\nLeopold, in Stockmar's opinion, would be well advised to propose for\r\nthe hand of a daughter of Louis Philippe.\r\n\r\nAfter the French evacuation Stockmar urged unceasingly the necessity\r\nof a speedy conclusion of a definite treaty of peace. Russia, he\r\npointed out, was no longer distracted by the Polish rebellion, and the\r\nsympathies of the Tsar were entirely with the King of the Netherlands.\r\nThis was a circumstance bound to have a considerable influence upon\r\nthe policy of the Courts of Berlin and of Vienna. It was of the\r\nhighest importance, therefore, that Leopold should bring his ministers\r\nand the Chambers to recognize that the conditions of separation,\r\nset forth in the protocol of the eighteen articles, could no longer\r\nbe obtained, and that only those stipulations should be insisted\r\nupon which were essential to the independent existence of Belgium.\r\nAs Stockmar had foreseen, the new treaty, known as that of the\r\ntwenty-four articles, which the conference proceeded to frame, imposed\r\nharsher terms upon Belgium than those contained in the protocol of\r\nJune 26. That part of the province of Limburg which lay upon the\r\nright bank of the Meuse was now assigned to Holland, and Belgium was\r\ncalled upon to contribute an increased share of the public debt of\r\nthe two countries. In other respects also the Belgians had to suffer\r\nfor their military inferiority to the Dutch. Nevertheless, when all\r\nefforts to induce the conference to modify its terms had proved\r\nuseless, Stockmar, scouting the notion of abdication, counselled\r\nLeopold to agree to them. \"Let the King,\" he wrote, \"cry aloud against\r\nthe injustice which has been done him . . . Let him show that he went\r\nto Belgium under perfectly different conditions . . . Let the Belgian\r\nministry cry out equally loud. But in the meantime let everything be\r\ndone to induce the Chambers to accept the treaty.\"\r\n\r\nLeopold having let it be known that, were the deputies to refuse to\r\nagree to the terms imposed by the conference, he would be driven to\r\nabdicate, the Chambers, on November 3, authorized him to conclude\r\na formal treaty of peace and separation upon the basis of the\r\ntwenty-four articles. This document was accordingly signed in London,\r\non November 15, 1831, by the plenipotentiaries of Belgium and of the\r\nfive great Powers. The King of Holland refused to be a party to the\r\nagreement, but, before the expiration of the armistice, he had been\r\nwarned that any act of hostility against Belgium would be treated as a\r\ndeclaration of war against the Powers. In addition, by a supplementary\r\narticle, the contracting parties guaranteed to Belgium the execution\r\nof the treaty. Ratifications, it was laid down, were to be exchanged\r\nwithin the space of two months.[170] At various periods during these\r\nnegotiations Talleyrand had experienced considerable difficulty in\r\npersuading the French government to agree to the decisions of the\r\nconference. When at last it had reluctantly given its assent to the\r\nconditions of separation he was at pains to show the advantages which\r\nFrance would derive from the treaty. The Duchy of Bouillon, he\r\npointed out, no longer formed part of the Duchy of Luxemburg, whilst\r\nthe incorporation of Arlon with Belgium increased the strength of the\r\nFrench frontier towards Longwy. Furthermore, the cession of half of\r\nthe Duchy of Luxemburg to Belgium placed the Germanic Confederation at\r\na greater distance from France and, inasmuch as the fortress was no\r\nlonger to form part of a military system,[171] it would cease to have\r\nany importance. With regard to the repartition of the debt, which the\r\nFrench government had objected to as pressing unduly upon Belgium,\r\nTalleyrand contended that the general interests of Europe urgently\r\ndemanded a settlement of the whole question, and that the Belgians,\r\nafter their wretched display in the summer, had been treated with more\r\ngenerosity than they had any right to expect.[172]\r\n\r\nWhilst the conference had been framing the conditions of separation\r\nbetween Holland and Belgium, the French government had brought forward\r\na scheme for a general disarmament. Sébastiani in the summer had\r\nproposed a reduction of establishments to a normal peace footing, but\r\nhad found that the German Powers were unwilling to revert to ordinary\r\nconditions of military strength, until the Polish insurrection should\r\nbe at an end. After the Russian entry in Warsaw, however, the French\r\novertures met with a ready response. The continental Powers agreed to\r\nbegin disarming on January 1, 1832, and to proceed until their armies\r\nshould be reduced to their peace establishments. Inasmuch as England\r\nhad not added to her naval or land forces she could not enter into an\r\nagreement to disarm, but Lord Granville was instructed to communicate\r\nto Sébastiani the satisfaction which so practical a manifestation of\r\npeaceful intentions afforded to the British government.[173]\r\n\r\nThe question of the demolition of the barrier fortresses had been\r\nproceeding side by side with the settlement of the conditions under\r\nwhich Belgium was to be separated from Holland. Talleyrand, however,\r\nwas not admitted to these negotiations which were conducted between\r\nthe plenipotentiaries of Great Britain, Austria, Russia and Prussia\r\nand those of Belgium. The result of their deliberations was embodied\r\nin a document, known as the Fortress Convention, which was signed\r\nby the representatives of the five Powers concerned on December 14,\r\n1831. When La Tour-Maubourg had been sent to Brussels, during the\r\nFrench occupation of Belgium, he had been instructed to press for\r\nthe demolition of the fortifications of Ath, Mons, Menin, Charleroi\r\nand Tournay. The Powers, however, elected to preserve the defences\r\nof the two last-named towns and to dismantle in their place the\r\nworks of Philippeville and Marienburg. Palmerston, without doubt,\r\nwas mainly responsible for this decision which was to create great\r\ndissatisfaction in Paris. He was resolved, under no circumstance, to\r\nadmit the principle of allowing France to have a voice in determining\r\nwhich of the fortresses, erected at the expense of the four Powers,\r\nshould be destroyed. After her attempts to arrive at a separate\r\nunderstanding with Belgium concerning them, he may have thought that\r\nshe required to be reminded of the true state of the case. Yet it\r\nwould appear that the mere fact that her plenipotentiary had not\r\nappended his signature to the convention must have made her position\r\nin the matter sufficiently clear to the world. But, in persuading the\r\nmembers of the conference to substitute Philippeville and Marienburg\r\nfor Charleroi and Tournay, Palmerston was not actuated by a desire\r\nwantonly to slight France. In the question of the destruction of the\r\nBelgian fortresses Grey's Cabinet was in a very delicate position as\r\nregards the Parliament.[174] An embittered opposition was bound to\r\ndemand to know on what grounds the government proposed to justify\r\nits policy of sanctioning the demolition of fortifications, which\r\nthe greatest captain of the day had pronounced to be necessary to\r\nthe security of Europe. Now Wellington, it would appear, considered\r\nCharleroi and Tournay as of more importance to the defence of Belgium\r\nthan Philippeville and Marienburg, and Lord Grey and his colleagues\r\ncould not afford to disregard his opinion. It must be remembered also\r\nthat, on several occasions during the course of the negotiations,\r\nFrance had shown a strong desire to regain possession of these two\r\nplaces of which she had been deprived after Waterloo, and it was hoped\r\nthat, were their fortifications to be demolished, they would cease to\r\noffer the same attractions to her.[175]\r\n\r\nWithout doubt the decision of the Powers to deprive France of any\r\nvoice in the settlement of the question of the fortresses placed her\r\nin a very anomalous position. She was a party to the treaty which\r\nestablished the independence, defined the frontiers and guaranteed\r\nthe neutrality of Belgium, nevertheless Austria, Prussia, Russia\r\nand Great Britain had proceeded to conclude at once a separate\r\nconvention with Belgium against her. By her own action, however, she\r\nwas debarred from bringing forward this aspect of the case as an\r\nargument against her exclusion from the fortress agreement. Far from\r\nraising any objections to the conduct of the four Powers in drawing\r\nup the protocol of April 17, without consultation with her, she had\r\nexpressed the greatest satisfaction with its contents. At her request\r\nit was communicated to her officially, in order that an allusion\r\nmight be made to it in the Speech from the Throne. Louis Philippe, in\r\nopening the Parliament on July 23, 1831, accordingly announced the\r\nearly destruction of the barrier fortresses, as a proof that the four\r\nPowers had abandoned the system established against France in 1815.\r\nIn point of fact the apprehensions of her aggressive spirit had been\r\nintensified by the Revolution of July and, in deciding to demolish\r\nsome of the frontier defences of the Low Countries, the Powers had not\r\nbeen actuated by any desire to propitiate the new _régime_. But once\r\nthe partition of the Kingdom of the Netherlands had been accomplished,\r\nit was recognized that the Belgians alone could not keep in repair and\r\nefficiently defend the twenty-three barrier fortresses. Ill-equipped\r\nand insufficiently garrisoned they would not have contributed to the\r\nprotection of Belgium, but would have offered a constant temptation\r\nto the French to lay hands upon them. If France, however, chose to\r\nimagine that in this matter the policy of the Powers was dictated by\r\na desire to please her, it was unnecessary to inform her that she was\r\nlabouring under a delusion. It was probably the knowledge that the\r\nfiction contained in the paragraph of the King's Speech, referring to\r\nthe fortresses, could not be maintained for long, which had induced\r\nthe French government to attempt to negotiate a separate agreement\r\nwith Belgium.[176]\r\n\r\nBoth Palmerston and Stockmar appear to have been convinced that\r\nTalleyrand had prompted his government to protest against the fortress\r\nconvention.[177] But their suspicions with regard to him seem to have\r\nbeen unfounded. In pursuance of his instructions, in his conversations\r\nwith Grey and Palmerston, he was bound to employ those arguments most\r\ncalculated to induce them to make some concessions to the wishes of\r\nhis Court, but his despatches show that he disapproved strongly of\r\nthe attitude he was directed to adopt. On December 15, in forwarding\r\na copy of the fortress treaty, the contents of which he knew would be\r\nexceedingly displeasing to his government, he told Sébastiani plainly\r\nthat La Tour-Maubourg's mission to Brussels was largely responsible\r\nfor the determination of the four Powers to select the fortresses for\r\ndestruction, without regard to the wishes of France. That affair,\r\nmoreover, in his opinion, had been managed in a very clumsy fashion.\r\nWhen the government decided to try to arrange a separate understanding\r\nwith Belgium, it should have conducted its negotiations in the\r\nstrictest secrecy.[178]\r\n\r\nSébastiani, for the reason which has already been explained, was\r\nprecluded from objecting openly to the exclusion of France from the\r\nfortress convention, and was compelled to confine his protests to\r\nremonstrances against the selection of Philippeville and Marienburg\r\nfor demolition. Talleyrand was instructed to contend that the\r\nfortifications of these two places, having been erected before 1815,\r\ncould not be held to fall within the category of works constructed\r\nat the expense of the Powers. Furthermore, he was to urge that it\r\nwas incompatible with the complete independence of Belgium, which\r\nFrance was anxious to see established, that the Powers should specify\r\nwhich fortresses King Leopold was to dismantle.[179] Talleyrand,\r\nhowever, reported that Lord Palmerston was quite unshaken by these\r\narguments. The British minister gave him clearly to understand that\r\nLa Tour-Maubourg's proceedings at Brussels had impressed him most\r\nunfavourably. At the same time, pointing out that Philippeville and\r\nMarienburg were the fortresses in closest proximity to the frontier\r\nof France, he hinted that the French government must have some secret\r\nreason for objecting to their demolition. \"Nevertheless,\" reported\r\nTalleyrand, \"I still believe that he is well disposed towards us. He\r\nis, however, in a difficult position as regards the Commons. . . .\r\nWe must bring pressure to bear upon the Belgians.\"[180] Sébastiani's\r\nfears that the policy of the Powers aimed at the re-establishment of\r\nthe Holy Alliance, were, he assured him, in language no less emphatic\r\nthan that used by Granville in Paris, entirely without foundation.\r\nFar too much importance, he urged, was attached to the fortress\r\nconvention. The King's government, in his opinion, would be well\r\nadvised to accept it, and to declare publicly that its provisions\r\nwere in harmony with the protocol of April 17. Russia was no longer\r\noccupied with the rebellion of the Poles, and the Northern Courts\r\nwere evincing a strong disposition to draw together closely. Under\r\nthese conditions, he regarded it as essential that France should\r\nmaintain friendly relations with England. \"It was a matter of far\r\nmore real importance than the question of the fortresses.\"[181] But\r\nhis endeavours to soothe the irritation of his government met with\r\nno success. He was instructed to announce in London that France,\r\nseeing that satisfaction was denied her in the affair of the fortress\r\nconvention, would refuse to ratify the treaty of separation of\r\nNovember 15, 1831. Furthermore, Casimir Périer, who, on account of\r\nSébastiani's state of health, had taken charge of the portfolio of\r\nForeign Affairs, declared that, \"in view of the general uncertainty\r\nrespecting the course of events in Belgium and Holland, the signature\r\nof the proposed convention of disarmament must be postponed.\"[182]\r\n\r\nThe French agents in the meanwhile had not been idle at Brussels. On\r\nDecember 12 General Tiburce Sébastiani, the brother of the minister,\r\narrived. \"Ostensibly,\" reported Adair, \"he has come to visit this\r\ntown and Antwerp, but his real purpose is to prevent the accession\r\nof the Belgian government to the fortress convention.\" This officer\r\ncertainly brought a letter for Belliard containing instructions\r\nwhich justified the British minister's conclusions, but his mission\r\nappears also to have been connected with some unfounded rumour, which\r\nhad reached the French government, that the Orangists were about\r\nto put into execution their designs against Leopold's throne.[183]\r\nThat monarch now found himself once more, as he himself described\r\nit, \"between the hammer and the anvil.\"[184] Louis Philippe[185]\r\nwrote indignantly complaining that the agreement of September 8,\r\nentered into with La Tour-Maubourg, had not been complied with. In\r\nvain Leopold produced the instructions, with which Goblet and Van\r\nde Weyer, who had negotiated the convention, had been furnished,\r\nand protested that the Belgian plenipotentiaries had been forced to\r\nsign, under the threat that the Powers would refuse to ratify the\r\ntreaty of separation, should they persist in opposing their wishes\r\nwith respect to the fortresses. General Belliard, at the same time,\r\nintimated that, were the Dutch again to attack Belgium, no assistance\r\nfrom France could be expected. To Adair, who, on the other hand,\r\nbegged him to stand firm, Leopold had expressed his determination\r\nto disregard the French objections and to adhere to the convention.\r\nBut at the threat that, were his Kingdom again to be overrun, France\r\nwould leave him to his fate, his resolution broke down and Goblet\r\nwas directed to announce in London that the Belgian ratification of\r\nthe fortress agreement would be withheld.[186] Stockmar, writing\r\nfrom London, impressed upon King Leopold that his refusal to ratify\r\nthe convention of December 14 would be eagerly seized upon by the\r\nabsolute Powers as an excuse for withholding their adhesion to the\r\ntreaty of separation. Already the news that differences had arisen\r\nbetween France and England, upon the subject of the fortresses,\r\nhad enabled Metternich to reply to Mr. Forbes, the British _chargé\r\nd'affaires_, who had been instructed to urge him to transmit to London\r\nthe necessary authority for an exchange of ratifications, that France\r\nwas holding back and that it was important that all the Powers should\r\nact together in the matter. Prince Metternich was torn between his\r\nfears that the continued state of uncertainty as to the affairs of\r\nthe Low Countries might lead to a war, and his desire to propitiate\r\nRussia. Nicholas was believed to have counselled the King of the\r\nNetherlands to agree to the treaty, but to be resolved, none the less,\r\nto withhold his own ratification until that sovereign's reluctance to\r\naccept the conditions of separation should have been overcome.[187] M.\r\nCasimir Périer, in the meanwhile, however, was beginning to realize\r\nthat Palmerston was determined not to yield to the outcry about the\r\nfortresses, and that were France, on that account, to decline to\r\nratify the treaty of separation not only would the labours of the\r\nLondon conference for the past year be rendered nugatory, but the good\r\nrelations which had been established with England would be seriously\r\nimpaired. Moreover, should the negotiations break down, Lord Grey\r\nmight be compelled to resign, and he had good reason to apprehend,\r\nthat a change of government in England would be followed quickly\r\nby his own downfall. An important group of deputies in the Chamber\r\ngave him their votes, only because they believed that his alliance\r\nwith the Whigs ensured the maintenance of peace. But this reason for\r\ntheir support of him would disappear on the day on which the Tories\r\nshould return to office.[188] Under these circumstances Talleyrand\r\nwas directed to obtain from the representatives of the four Powers\r\n\"some declaration calculated to reassure the King's government as to\r\nthe spirit in which the fortress convention had been drawn up.\" This\r\nresult was achieved by means of a document in which it was affirmed\r\nthat the arrangements respecting the fortresses were consistent with\r\nthe independence, neutrality and sovereignty of Belgium, and that that\r\ncountry stood upon an equal footing as regards the five guaranteeing\r\nPowers. Casmir Périer declared himself well pleased to receive this\r\nempty satisfaction and, forthwith, announced his intention of adhering\r\nto the treaty of separation.[189] On January 31, accordingly, the two\r\nwestern Powers exchanged ratifications with Belgium and, at the same\r\ntime, it was resolved to keep open the protocol, in the hope that the\r\nNorthern Courts would before long confirm the signatures of their\r\nplenipotentiaries.[190]\r\n\r\nScarcely had this difficulty been settled when grave complications\r\narose in another direction. The promises of the Pope, that reforms\r\nwould be introduced into the administration of local affairs in\r\nRomagna, had not been carried out. The intention manifested by\r\nthe Roman government to disregard its pledges was followed by\r\na recrudescence of unrest in the Legations. M. Casimir Périer,\r\naccordingly, proposed that, were foreign intervention to be required\r\nto maintain the authority of His Holiness, a French corps should\r\noccupy Ancona. But Metternich demurred, and, as an alternative,\r\nsuggested that a French naval force should be sent to the Adriatic to\r\nact in combination with the Austrian squadron. On February 1, however,\r\nthe news arrived that the Austrians had entered Bologna, whereupon\r\nM. Casimir Périer at once ordered a French regiment to be embarked\r\nat Toulon for Ancona. Were that town to be occupied by the Austrians\r\nbefore the French expedition could arrive, the troops, Lord Granville\r\nwas informed in confidence, would be landed at Civita Vecchia. The\r\naction of the French government would, M. Casimir Périer declared to\r\nthe British ambassador, hasten the departure of the Austrians and\r\ninduce Prince Metternich to press the Court of Rome to adopt those\r\nreforms by which alone permanent tranquillity could be established in\r\nthe Legations.[191]\r\n\r\nThe more detailed information as to the course of events in Romagna,\r\ntransmitted by Sainte-Aulaire and the British consul at Rome,\r\nsuggested the existence of a secret understanding between His\r\nHoliness and the Cabinet of Vienna. At Forli the Pontifical troops\r\nwere reported to have shot down in cold blood peaceful and unarmed\r\ninhabitants, and their behaviour created the impression that they were\r\nanxious to produce disorder, in order to furnish Cardinal Albani,\r\nthe Legate, with a pretext for invoking the aid of Austria.[192]\r\nSuspicions on this score were heightened by the fact that, although\r\nMarshal Radetzky only received the application for assistance on\r\nJanuary 23, his orders, in which he styled himself commander-in-chief\r\nof the army of Italy, were dated on the 19th, four days before the\r\narrival of the cardinal's demand for intervention.[193] Upon learning\r\nof these proceedings the Comte de Sainte-Aulaire at once notified\r\nto Cardinal Bernetti, the State Secretary, that the entry of an\r\nImperial army into the Papal States would be followed by the immediate\r\noccupation of Ancona by a French force. Bernetti appears reluctantly\r\nto have acquiesced, but, after the expedition had sailed from Toulon,\r\nacting, without doubt, at the dictation of the Austrian ambassador,\r\nhe formally protested against the disembarkation of any French troops\r\nwithin the dominions of the Pope.[194] When the news first reached\r\nVienna that the French had taken steps to occupy Ancona, Metternich,\r\nconcealing his annoyance, was at pains to impress upon the public\r\nthat this measure was the result of a previous understanding with\r\nAustria.[195] On the other hand, at St. Petersburg the intelligence\r\nthat the French had intervened in Italy was held to have rendered war\r\ninevitable, and Nicholas forthwith declared his intention of giving\r\narmed assistance to Austria.[196] From London Talleyrand reported\r\nthat Palmerston spoke very guardedly when he sought to ascertain the\r\nviews of the British government upon the matter. In his own opinion,\r\nand this aspect of the case he on more than one occasion brought to\r\nthe notice of M. Casimir Périer, it was much to be regretted that the\r\ndemonstrations in Italy had taken place before Austria should have\r\nratified the Belgian treaty. The accounts, moreover, of the lawless\r\nproceedings of the French commander at Ancona, which soon began to\r\narrive, created a very general alarm. Not only had the troops forced\r\ntheir way into the citadel, but a proclamation was issued by Captain\r\nGallois, drawn up in terms so hostile to Austria, as to amount\r\npractically to a declaration of war. That individual, however, who was\r\neither a member of, or in league with, the French secret societies,\r\nthe agents of which were striving to stir up a revolution in Italy,\r\nwas promptly disavowed and the fact of his recall to France was\r\ncommunicated to foreign governments. Nevertheless, wrote Talleyrand,\r\nthe affair has created a most painful impression. \"The territory of\r\nan independent sovereign has been violated at a time of profound\r\npeace and the tricolour has been hoisted over a fortress which does\r\nnot belong to France.\"[197] In a conversation which he had had with\r\nWilliam IV. at a _levée_, His Majesty spoke to him most strongly about\r\nthe impropriety of these proceedings which, ministers also informed\r\nhim, had greatly increased their difficulties in both Houses. They\r\ncould have added with perfect truth that their relations with their\r\nsovereign had suffered considerably owing to this affair.[198]\r\n\r\nThe Austrian policy of deliberately encouraging misgovernment in the\r\nItalian States and of placing every obstacle in the way of reforms\r\nwas hateful to Lord Palmerston. Apart from other considerations he\r\nwas convinced that a continuance of this state of affairs must,\r\nsooner or later, drive France to intervene in such a manner as to\r\nrender a war inevitable with Austria.[199] Already, on February\r\n20, before he had received the news of the arrival of the French\r\nexpedition at Ancona, he had directed Mr. Seymour, the British\r\nminister at Florence, to proceed to Rome \"to represent the anxiety\r\nof His Majesty's government to see those causes, which have produced\r\nso much difficulty, effectually removed.\" He was to urge that no\r\nmeasures would appear \"to afford so good a hope of success as a\r\ncomplete adoption of those reforms which were pointed out in the\r\nmemorandum of May 21, 1831.\" Lastly, he was to impress upon Cardinal\r\nBernetti that, \"if the reports be true that the ranks of the papal\r\ntroops, which recently entered the Legations, have been replenished\r\nby emptying the prisons of criminals and by calling down the lawless\r\nbands from the mountains, the Roman government cannot divest itself\r\nof a deep responsibility for the melancholy events which marked the\r\nentry into Cesena and Forli. The innocent blood which was wantonly\r\nshed in the streets of those towns might well be accepted as a full\r\natonement for the political offences of the people of Romagna.\"[200]\r\nWhen the story became known of the manner in which the French entry\r\ninto Ancona had been carried out, Palmerston readily agreed to do all\r\nin his power to soothe the irritation of Austria and to assist to\r\nremove the bad impression created by Captain Gallois' lawlessness.\r\nSeymour was further instructed to inform Cardinal Bernetti that the\r\nBritish government was fully satisfied that the French occupation\r\nof Ancona was but a temporary measure, which the condition of the\r\nLegations had occasioned. He was to reiterate the necessity for the\r\nimmediate introduction of the promised reforms and \"to draw the\r\nserious attention of the Roman government to the fact, that the course\r\nwhich it was pursuing with respect to the Legations, had already had\r\nthe effect of turning the eyes of the population of those provinces\r\ntowards Austria. . . . The system of administration established in\r\nLombardy and Venetia, although not free from defects, was looked upon\r\nwith envy by the subjects of the Pope.[201] At Vienna Sir Frederick\r\nLamb was directed to assure Prince Metternich that the occupation of\r\nAncona would cease as soon as His Holiness should have carried out his\r\nengagements.[202]\r\n\r\nMetternich, reported Lamb, received the news of the French proceedings\r\nat Ancona very calmly. He expressed himself as confident that Gallois'\r\nactions would be disavowed by his government. \"The Emperor,\" he\r\ndeclared, \"would be justified in falling upon the French at Ancona,\r\nbut he was too great a sovereign to receive an insult from the\r\ncaptain of a frigate or the colonel of a regiment.\" It was to England\r\nthat Austria looked for support at this crisis. She ruled the seas and\r\nit rested with her to decide whether, or not, France should hold the\r\ncommand of the Mediterranean. About a week after this conversation had\r\ntaken place Metternich informed Lamb that he was perfectly satisfied\r\nwith the explanations which Marshal Maison had been instructed to\r\ngive, and that no demand would be made to the French government for\r\nthe evacuation of Ancona, so long as the Austrians continued to occupy\r\nthe Legations.[203]\r\n\r\nThis condition of affairs was allowed to prevail for some years. Both\r\nPowers retained their troops in the Papal States, and the embarrassing\r\nnecessity under which the French government was placed of making\r\nthe occupation of Ancona depend upon the presence of an Austrian\r\ngarrison at Bologna constituted Metternich's revenge for M. Périer's\r\nintervention in Italy.\r\n\r\nThe attention of the _corps diplomatique_ had not been concentrated\r\nexclusively upon the complications to which the French proceedings\r\nat Ancona might give rise. Early in the month of February it was\r\nknown that Count Orloff had been despatched by the Tsar on a special\r\nmission to the Hague. It was in deference to the wishes of Nicholas\r\nthat the Courts of Vienna and of Berlin had decided to withhold their\r\nratification of the treaty of separation of November 15, 1831, and\r\nthe keenest curiosity prevailed as to the instructions with which\r\nthe Tsar's emissary had been furnished. In respect to the condition\r\nof affairs in the Low Countries Russia was in a somewhat peculiar\r\nsituation as regards England. During the Napoleonic war Russia had\r\nborrowed at Amsterdam a sum of 25,000,000 florins. At the peace\r\nthe King of the Netherlands and the King of Great Britain agreed\r\nrespectively to bear one-half of the charge of this debt. But it was\r\nprovided that, should at any time the King of the Netherlands be\r\ndeprived of his sovereignty over the Belgian provinces, this charge\r\nshould cease. The contingency referred to in the treaty had come\r\nabout, under circumstances never contemplated by the statesmen by whom\r\nit had been drawn up. They had hoped to give Russia a direct interest\r\nin preserving the union, but it was now the British government\r\nwhich desired to see it abolished and the Tsar who wished it to be\r\nmaintained. Without doubt, according to the letter of the treaty,\r\nEngland was no longer bound to pay a share of the Russian-Dutch\r\nloan. Judged by the spirit of it, however, she could not honestly\r\nescape from the charge which she had undertaken to bear. This last\r\nconstruction of the agreement was adopted by Palmerston, who admitted\r\nthe British liability in a new convention, by the terms of which\r\nthe Tsar guaranteed that, should the stipulations made for the\r\nindependence and neutrality of Belgium be endangered by the course\r\nof events, he would contract no other engagements without a previous\r\nagreement with his Britannic Majesty. Palmerston had thus earned the\r\ngratitude of the Tsar and had, in addition, made it difficult for him\r\nto intervene actively on behalf of the King of Holland.[204] Ministers\r\nwere debarred, however from referring to this inner history of the\r\naffair in Parliament, where their policy in the matter of the Russian\r\nloan was severely attacked both by the Tory Opposition and by the\r\nRadicals, who deprecated the notion of voting pecuniary assistance to\r\nthe autocratic government of Russia.\r\n\r\nThe Count Alexis Orloff, whose journey to the Hague was the subject\r\nof so much speculation in the chanceries of Europe, was the natural\r\nson of a younger brother of Gregory Orloff, the lover of Catherine\r\nII. and a prominent actor in that palace revolution of 1762, which\r\ncost the Emperor Peter III. his throne, and very probably his\r\nlife. After serving in the Napoleonic wars, the Count Alexis had\r\ngained the lasting gratitude of his imperial master by his resolute\r\nbehaviour, which had contributed not a little to upset the designs\r\nof the _Decembrists_, as those military conspirators were termed,\r\nwho, in 1825, had sought to prevent the accession of Nicholas. Ever\r\nafterwards, in consequence, Alexis Orloff was selected by the Tsar for\r\nthe most delicate and secret missions. No notice of his departure was\r\ngiven to any member of the _corps diplomatique_ at St. Petersburg.\r\nCount Nesselrode, after he had started, merely informed Lord\r\nHeytesbury that he had been sent to the Hague to extract a categorical\r\nstatement from the King of the Netherlands as to whether he would\r\naccept the treaty of separation, and, in the event of his declaring\r\nthat he would withhold his consent, to signify to him that he must\r\nnot look to Russia for support.[205] This was in substance all that\r\nMr. Chad, the British minister at Berlin, could discover about the\r\nobjects of Orloff's mission during the Count's stay in the Prussian\r\ncapital. But he noted that the general effect of his visit to Berlin\r\nhad been to incline the Prussian government to espouse more warmly\r\nthe cause of the King of the Netherlands, a result which, he pointed\r\nout, was inconsistent with the purpose which the Tsar's emissary was\r\nalleged to have in view.[206] Fuller information, however, on that\r\nscore was soon forthcoming from Vienna. On February 25, Sir Frederick\r\nLamb was able to transmit to Lord Palmerston a copy of Orloff's\r\nsecret instructions. These contained a clause to the effect that the\r\nEmperor of Russia would not recognize the King of the Belgians, until\r\nhe should have been acknowledged by the King of the Netherlands.\r\nFurthermore, the Count was directed to protest against any measures\r\nof coercion, which France and England might decide to adopt against\r\nHolland, and to declare that the Tsar would regard all concessions,\r\nobtained by such means, as null and void. Lastly, whilst in London,\r\nwhither he was to proceed when he had completed his task at the Hague,\r\nOrloff was \"to assist by all means in his power the endeavours which,\r\nfor the past twelve months, Prince Lieven and Count Matuszewic[207]\r\nhad been making to prevent a union of the British Cabinet with that of\r\nthe Palais Royal.\"[208]\r\n\r\nDuring his stay at Berlin, Orloff tried to win over the Prussian\r\ngovernment to the Tsar's views upon the Belgian question. But his\r\nattempts were unsuccessful. Ancillon, the chief minister, was greatly\r\nalarmed at the disturbance of the European Concert to which he feared\r\nthe Russian policy must lead. Were Austria, Prussia and Russia to\r\nmake their ratification of the separation treaty depend upon the\r\nacceptation of its conditions by the King of the Netherlands, the\r\nPowers must necessarily fall into two opposing groups: France and\r\nGreat Britain on the one side, and the three Northern Courts on the\r\nother. Rather than help to create so perilous a situation, Prussia\r\nwould, with much regret be obliged to \"_aller en avant_ _et de\r\nratifier_.\" Ancillon seems to have succeeded in extracting from\r\nOrloff a promise that he would for the present, at least, refrain\r\nfrom communicating the secret clauses of his instructions to the\r\nKing of the Netherlands, and to have directed the Prussian minister\r\nat St. Petersburg to endeavour to persuade Nicholas to cancel them.\r\nMetternich, reported Lamb, regarded the matter in the same light as\r\nAncillon, and was resolved to assimilate his policy to that of the\r\nCourt of Berlin. It was presumably for the purpose of thwarting the\r\nRussian plan that a copy of Orloff's secret instructions was placed in\r\nthe hands of the British ambassador.[209]\r\n\r\nWhen France and England had ratified the treaty of separation,\r\nPalmerston at once instructed the British representatives at Vienna\r\nand at Berlin to urge the Austrian and Prussian Courts to follow the\r\nexample of the western Powers. Metternich, wrote Lamb, eluded the\r\nquestion, and insisted upon the necessity of waiting to hear the\r\nresult of Orloff's mission.[210] At Berlin, Mr. Chad was enjoined\r\nto remind M. Ancillon that the action of the Prussian government in\r\nrefusing to ratify was a violation of its promises.[211] In M. Casimir\r\nPérier's opinion, the policy of the absolute Courts was dictated by\r\nthe hope that a second rejection of the Reform Bill by the House of\r\nLords might lead to a change of government in England.[212] In the\r\nmeanwhile, Count Orloff had arrived at the Hague on February 20.\r\nAt Berlin, he had intimated that under no circumstances would his\r\nstay in Holland be prolonged beyond ten days.[213] Nevertheless, the\r\nperiod which he had assigned for the duration of his visit was greatly\r\nexceeded. There was reason to believe, however, that communications\r\nhad reached him from his Court which, if they did not absolutely\r\nannul, unquestionably modified his instructions and brought them\r\nmore into harmony with the views of the constitutional Powers.[214]\r\nWithout doubt, the repugnance evinced at Vienna and at Berlin to break\r\nwith the London conference was largely responsible for the changed\r\ndisposition of Nicholas. But the arrival at St. Petersburg, after\r\nOrloff had left, of the draft of a proposed new treaty of separation,\r\nin which the King of the Netherlands put forward the most absurd\r\npretensions, would seem to have impressed the Tsar most unfavourably.\r\nHe appears to have grown very suspicious that the Dutch Court, acting\r\nunder the inspiration of the French legitimists, was striving to\r\nembroil the Great Powers in a war.[215]\r\n\r\nPalmerston, under these circumstances, decided to exercise an\r\nincreased pressure upon the wavering resolution of the Northern\r\nCourts. The sittings of the conference, he announced, would be\r\nsuspended until the signatory Powers of the treaty of separation\r\nshould have ratified that agreement. Furthermore, on March 16, Sir\r\nCharles Bagot, the British ambassador, was instructed to protest\r\nagainst Count Orloff's continued stay at the Hague.[216] The threat\r\nthat the London conference would be dissolved appears to have excited\r\nconsiderable alarm at Berlin.[217] Although the obstinacy of the King\r\nof the Netherlands was proof against all remonstrances, Palmerston's\r\naction, which had the support of the French government, was probably\r\nsuccessful in bringing Orloff's mission to an end. In any case,\r\non March 22, Verstolk, the Dutch Minister for Foreign Affairs,\r\nofficially informed Nicholas' envoy that the King could not accept\r\nthe separation treaty of the twenty-four articles as it existed. No\r\nsooner had he made this statement than Count Orloff at once handed\r\nhim the declaration which he had been instructed to deliver. The note\r\nin question was to the effect that, although His Imperial Majesty\r\nwould not participate himself in any measures of coercion to force\r\nthe King to accept the treaty, he should not oppose those steps which\r\nhis allies might resolve to take in order to impose its conditions\r\nupon Holland. Directly they learnt that Orloff had delivered his\r\ndeclaration, the Austrian and Prussian ministers sent separate notes\r\nto M. Verstolk, notifying the adhesion of their respective Courts to\r\nthe course pursued by the Russian Cabinet. Orloff, two days later,\r\ntook leave of the King and started for London.[218]\r\n\r\nThe failure of Orloff's mission deprived the Austrian and Prussian\r\nCabinets of all reasonable excuse for withholding their assent to the\r\ntreaty. Indeed, before the Russian agent had taken his departure from\r\nthe Hague, Metternich informed Sir Frederick Lamb that the Austrian\r\nratification would be forwarded to London without further delay. The\r\npresence of the French in Italy, and the fear that the course upon\r\nwhich the absolute Courts had embarked would tend to promote a close\r\nalliance between England and France were factors in the situation,\r\nwhich, in the opinion of the British ambassador, had greatly\r\ninfluenced Metternich's decision.[219] Accordingly, on April 18, at\r\nthe London Foreign Office the Austrian and Prussian plenipotentiaries\r\nexchanged ratifications of the treaty of November 15, 1831, with\r\nthe representative of Belgium. The Prussian minister, Bülow, had\r\nbeen furnished with a discretionary power either to proceed with the\r\nmatter or to await the Russian ratification, and he appears to have\r\nyielded to the pressure brought to bear upon him by Palmerston and\r\nTalleyrand.[220] Both the Prussian and Austrian ratifications were\r\naccompanied by reservations with respect to the rights of the Germanic\r\nConfederation in Connection with any cession or exchange of a portion\r\nof the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg.[221]\r\n\r\nIt was resolved, as on former occasions, to keep open the protocol\r\nin order that Russia might still be enabled to become a party to\r\nthe treaty. Lieven and Matuszewic, the Russian plenipotentiaries,\r\nhad authority to ratify, but with reservations respecting three\r\narticles of the treaty which concerned the navigation of the Scheldt,\r\nthe construction of a road, and the share of the debt to be borne\r\nby Belgium. But, were a limited ratification of this description\r\nto be accepted, Russia would necessarily be placed in a different\r\nsituation as regards Belgium to that occupied by the other contracting\r\nparties. This was a development to which Palmerston was altogether\r\nopposed. On the other hand, he was desirous above all things to avoid\r\nthe necessity of excluding Russia from the treaty. The rift in the\r\nEuropean Concert, which such a result would disclose, must encourage\r\nthe King of the Netherlands to resist the decisions of the conference\r\nand might endanger the general peace. The representatives of the\r\nPowers, not excepting Orloff, Lieven and Matuszewic were, however,\r\nsincerely anxious to discover a way out of the difficulty. At Brussels\r\nit was contended with some reason that the limited ratification\r\nof Russia might be held to invalidate the treaty as a whole. But\r\nStockmar, the counsellor of Leopold, pointed out that the existing\r\ngovernments in France and England considered that their acts of\r\nratification bound them indissolubly to the treaty. The struggle over\r\nthe Reform Bill had, however, entered upon its final stage, and it was\r\ndoubtful whether Lord Grey and his colleagues would emerge from it\r\nsuccessfully. Under these circumstances, urged Stockmar, it was well\r\nto remember that both Wellington and Aberdeen had declared that they\r\nshould not consider the treaty of the twenty-four articles as binding,\r\nuntil it should have been ratified by all the signatory Powers. Were\r\nGrey to fall, and were a Tory Cabinet to be formed, Russia very\r\nprobably might altogether refuse to ratify.[222]\r\n\r\nOn May 4 the deliberations of the conference at the Foreign Office\r\nwere prolonged far into the night. Talleyrand's powers of persuasion,\r\nPalmerston's determined will and skill in argument were alike directed\r\nto the task of devising some solution of the problem, which all\r\nparties might accept with dignity. The desired result was at last\r\nattained by means of an explanation of the purpose of the Russian\r\nreservation, which was inserted into the protocol. According to this\r\ndeclaration, the Russian plenipotentiaries asserted that their Court\r\nhad no other intention than to leave open the matters contained in the\r\nthree articles in question for subsequent settlement by Holland and\r\nBelgium. Under these conditions, Van de Weyer agreed to accept the\r\nRussian ratification with the proviso, which was also to be embodied\r\ninto the protocol, that his Court laid claim to the full benefit of\r\nthe engagements contracted towards Belgium by the five Powers. That\r\nsame night Orloff departed from England.[223] Nicholas had been very\r\ngratified by the flattering welcome which had been accorded to his\r\nfavourite in London society.[224] His satisfaction on this point\r\ncontributed, doubtless, to the happy termination of the negotiation.\r\nBut the statesmanlike conduct of Van de Weyer was, at the time, little\r\nappreciated in political circles in Brussels, where he was censured\r\nfor accepting the limited ratification of Russia.[225]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                       THE COERCION OF HOLLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cabinets of Lord Grey and of M. Casimir Périer had always regarded\r\nthe execution of the separation treaty as a measure which must\r\nnecessarily follow its ratification by the five contracting Powers.\r\nBut, during the spring and early summer of 1832, ministers, both in\r\nFrance and in England, were confronted by an internal situation of\r\nexceptional gravity. The Lords, on April 14, had passed the second\r\nreading of the third Reform Bill by a narrow majority. On May 7,\r\nhowever, three days after Russia had ratified the Belgian treaty,\r\nLord Lyndhurst successfully carried against the government a motion\r\npostponing the clause which disfranchised the boroughs. The Cabinet,\r\ntherefore, decided to advise the King \"to advance to the honour of the\r\npeerage such a number of persons as might ensure the success of the\r\nBill in all its essential principles.\"[226]\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the struggle the King had been a keen advocate\r\nof parliamentary reform. But the violent opposition which the measure\r\nhad excited had sensibly altered his feelings. Nor was it only with\r\nrespect to the Bill that His Majesty was beginning to entertain\r\nmisgivings. The conduct of foreign affairs had, for some time past,\r\ncaused him grave anxiety. He perceived, he wrote to Lord Grey, a\r\ndangerous tendency on the part of the government to subscribe to\r\nall the democratic theories which found favour in Paris. He realized\r\nthe importance of good relations with France, and he was prepared to\r\nadmit that it might be due to the existence of such an understanding\r\nthat war had been avoided in the Belgian question. But he mistrusted\r\nFrance and could not believe that she had abandoned her schemes of\r\nconquest and of territorial expansion. He held, therefore, that it\r\nwas impolitic to \"unite too closely with her in the prosecution of\r\nmeasures tending to give umbrage and alarm to other Powers.\"[227]\r\n\r\nIn consequence of these criticisms Lord Grey signified his willingness\r\nto resign. But a second letter from the King and a conversation,\r\nin which His Majesty assured him that he still enjoyed his full\r\nconfidence, induced him to remain in office. A fortnight later,\r\nhowever, when the King declined to follow the advice, contained in the\r\nCabinet minute of May 8, to create a sufficient number of peers to\r\nenable the Bill to pass, the government resigned. But the excitement\r\nthroughout the country and the attitude of the House of Commons\r\ncompelled Lord Lyndhurst and the Duke of Wellington to abandon all\r\nhope of forming a ministry. In face of their inability to carry out\r\nthe task with which he had entrusted them, the King had no alternative\r\nbut to send for his late ministers and to give them the guarantees,\r\nwhich they made an indispensable condition to their acceptation of\r\noffice. Lord Grey, however, was spared the necessity of resorting to\r\nthe powers which the crown had placed at his disposal. In deference\r\nto the King's wishes[228] Wellington and the chief opponents of the\r\nmeasure agreed to stay away from the House, and on June 4, in their\r\nabsence, the Bill was passed into law.\r\n\r\nFrance was less fortunate. Her domestic difficulties were only\r\ntemporarily overcome after grave disorder and much bloodshed. The\r\ncholera, brought back by the Russian armies from Turkey, had spread\r\nwestwards. The disease, which made its first appearance in England\r\nin the latter months of 1831, did terrible execution in Paris during\r\nthe spring and summer of 1832. M. Casimir Périer, who had been in bad\r\nhealth for some time past, was its most illustrious victim. His death,\r\non May 16, 1832, was the signal for a furious outburst of hostility\r\non the part of the parliamentary opponents of his system. At the same\r\ntime the avowed enemies of the Orleans monarchy, both Republican and\r\nCarlist, actively prepared to take advantage of the situation. _The\r\nSociety of the Friends of the People_, in defiance of the police,\r\nheld meetings at which armed insurrection was preached openly. \"I was\r\npresent at one of them,\" wrote Heinrich Heine, \"the smell reminded me\r\nof an old file of the _Moniteur_ of 1793 grown dirty from too much\r\nreading.\"[229]\r\n\r\nThe funeral, on June 5, of General Lamarque, the most prominent\r\nadvocate in the Chamber of the union of Belgium with France, was\r\nchosen by the revolutionary leaders as a favourable occasion for\r\nstriking their blow. But the authorities were upon the alert and both\r\nregular troops and national guards were quickly upon the scene of\r\naction. Nevertheless, it was not until artillery had been brought up\r\nthat, on the following day, June 6, the great barricade at the Cloître\r\nSaint-Merri was stormed and that this formidable insurrection was\r\nfinally suppressed. Nor was it only in the streets of Paris that the\r\ngovernment had to deal with an armed rising. On June 4 the Duchesse de\r\nBerri, the mother of the Duc de Bordeaux, the lawful King of France\r\nin the eyes of the Carlists, raised the standard of rebellion in La\r\nVendée. But her insurrection, which had been undertaken against the\r\nadvice of the wiser of the Carlists and of the old Royalist leaders\r\nin the West, was, in a few days, stamped out completely. The defence\r\nof the Château de la Pénissière, where a handful of Carlist gentlemen\r\nmade a brave stand against overwhelming odds, imparted, however,\r\na tinge of heroism to this, the last and the least famous of the\r\nRoyalist rebellions of La Vendée.\r\n\r\nFollowing quickly upon the defeat of the republicans in Paris and of\r\nthe Carlists in the West, came the news that the Duc de Reichstadt,\r\nthe heretofore King of Rome, was dying of consumption at Vienna. But\r\nMetternich, in transmitting this information, desired that Louis\r\nPhilippe's attention should be especially directed \"to his successor\r\nin the eyes of the Bonapartists.\" The young Louis Bonaparte, he\r\nbegged him to remember, was not under the safeguard of the Emperor\r\nof Austria, but, on the contrary, \"was deeply involved in all the\r\nmachinations of the revolutionary societies.\"[230] Few people,\r\nhowever, shared Metternich's forebodings, and the death of the Duc\r\nde Reichstadt, which took place on July 22, 1832, was generally\r\nconsidered, even by staunch Imperialists, to have disposed effectually\r\nof the chances of a Bonapartist restoration.[231] But neither the\r\nsuccessful suppression of two rebellions, nor the decease of a\r\ndangerous pretender to the throne could make up for the loss of the\r\nPresident of the Council. The death of M. Casimir Périer had deprived\r\nthe Cabinet of its strength and prestige. Louis Philippe, whilst\r\ndoing full justice to the courage and abilities of his late minister,\r\nwas perhaps not altogether sorry that his masterful personality no\r\nlonger presided at the council table. The _rôle_ of a constitutional\r\nmonarch was never to his taste. He longed always to take a direct\r\npart in the management of public affairs, and rather liked his people\r\nto think that his was the hand which guided the ship of State. He\r\nwas, therefore, in no great hurry to appoint a new President of the\r\nCouncil. He soon perceived, however, that a prolongation of this state\r\nof affairs would be prejudicial to the best interests of the monarchy\r\nboth at home and abroad.\r\n\r\nFor the past two months the London conference had been engaged upon\r\nfruitless efforts to induce the King of the Netherlands to agree to\r\nthe separation treaty. Moreover, His Majesty's obstinacy was not\r\nthe only difficulty with which the representatives of the Powers\r\nhad to deal. The Belgians clamoured loudly for the execution of the\r\ntreaty, and declared that, so long as the Dutch retained possession\r\nof Antwerp, they must decline to discuss any modification of its\r\nconditions.[232] Oblivious of their disasters of the year before, they\r\neven began to talk of ejecting the Dutch by force, and, as though to\r\nprove the seriousness of their intentions, proceeded to enrol Polish\r\nofficers in their army, and to make other warlike preparations.[233]\r\n\r\nAlthough determined that the main conditions of the treaty must be\r\nleft untouched, the members of the conference were anxious that\r\nthe minor points in dispute should form the subject of amicable\r\ndiscussions between the Dutch and Belgian representatives. It was on\r\nthis principle that all their proposals had been made. But neither at\r\nthe Hague nor at Brussels was any disposition evinced to listen to\r\nreasonable suggestions for a compromise.\r\n\r\nAt last, on July 10, the plenipotentiaries decided to forward their\r\nfinal proposals to the Hague and to announce, at the same time, that,\r\nif they were not accepted, no further modifications of the original\r\ntreaty would be submitted. Little hope, however, was entertained that\r\nthe King's obduracy would be overcome without a resort to force.\r\nBut before proceeding to adopt more active measures the British\r\ngovernment decided to dispatch Lord Durham upon a special mission to\r\nSt. Petersburg. Ill-health had recently compelled Lord Heytesbury to\r\nrelinquish his post, and his successor had not as yet been appointed.\r\nThe King of the Netherlands, it was believed, still trusted that\r\nthe Tsar would intervene on his behalf, should France and England\r\nbegin hostilities against him. Lord Durham was therefore charged\r\nto endeavour to persuade the Emperor Nicholas \"to give immediate\r\ninstructions to the Russian plenipotentiaries at the conference to\r\nco-operate cordially and effectually in whatever measures might\r\nappear best calculated to effect an early execution of the treaty.\"\r\nHe was to state most positively that France and England, under any\r\ncircumstances, were resolved to fulfil the engagements which they had\r\ncontracted towards Belgium. Lastly, he was to explain the views of His\r\nMajesty's government upon Italian, German and Polish affairs.[234]\r\n\r\nSeeing that it was the object of the British government to conciliate\r\nthe Tsar, in order to induce him to take part in measures which could\r\nnot be otherwise than extremely distasteful to him, it is strange that\r\nthis particular minister should have been selected for the mission.\r\nAs one of the most advanced politicians in the Cabinet Lord Durham\r\nwould hardly seem to have been the person best qualified to propitiate\r\nthe Emperor Nicholas. But at the time his suitability was perhaps\r\nonly a secondary consideration. On the question of the creation of\r\npeers to enable the Reform Bill to pass, he had seriously differed\r\nfrom Lord Grey, his own father-in-law, and it may have been the wish\r\nto avoid a complete rupture between them that prompted his despatch\r\nto St. Petersburg. The Emperor, however, whatever may have been the\r\nreal nature of his feelings with respect to Durham's appointment,\r\nevinced not the slightest resentment. On the contrary, he appeared\r\nto be at pains to pay him the greatest honours and, during the whole\r\nperiod of his six weeks' stay in the Russian capital, the ambassador\r\nwas the object of his most flattering attentions. Durham, who was\r\nhighly gratified by the warmth of the Imperial reception and by the\r\nmarked deference with which he was treated, was, for his part, no\r\nless anxious to create a favourable impression. When removed from\r\nthe turmoil of party politics he rarely failed to display those\r\nstatesmanlike qualities which he unquestionably possessed. Yet in\r\nspite of all his efforts, on this occasion, his embassy, in so far\r\nas its immediate objects were concerned, proved a complete failure.\r\nUnder no circumstances would the Tsar agree to join in any hostile\r\naction against Holland. But, whilst the autocrat assured him that such\r\nwas his irrevocable determination, he told him that he was equally\r\nresolved not to oppose those measures which other Powers might see\r\nfit to adopt, in order to obtain the execution of the separation\r\ntreaty.[235] This categorical statement of Nicholas' intention not\r\nto interpose, should coercion be applied to Holland, was the one\r\nsatisfactory piece of news which Lord Durham was enabled to transmit.\r\nIn all his conversations the Tsar manifested his extreme dislike of\r\nLouis Philippe and expressed his determination to render military\r\nassistance to Austria and Prussia, should France attempt to interfere\r\nin German affairs.[236] Lord Durham was not long in discovering that\r\nno good purpose would be served by adverting to Poland. The greatest\r\nindignation prevailed throughout Russia at the conduct of the\r\nPoles, and he quite agreed with Lord Heytesbury that the Tsar dared\r\nnot disregard the national resentment which their insurrection had\r\nprovoked. Only force, he saw clearly, would induce him to admit that\r\nother Powers had a right to interfere with his treatment of his Polish\r\nsubjects, and England most certainly had no intention of making the\r\nquestion a case for war. He conceived, therefore, that he might depart\r\nfrom the letter of his instructions and confine his observations upon\r\nthe subject to a mere informal expression to Count Nesselrode of the\r\ninterest felt by the British government in the general welfare of\r\nPoland.[237]\r\n\r\nBefore the end of July, it was known in London that the King of\r\nthe Netherlands was determined to reject the proposals which the\r\nconference had declared must be the last which could be submitted\r\nto him. Nevertheless Palmerston, encouraged seemingly by the\r\nlanguage of Van Zuylen, the Dutch plenipotentiary, decided to make a\r\nfurther attempt to avert the necessity of an appeal to force.[238]\r\nAccordingly, he drew up a fresh scheme for the settlement of the\r\npoints in dispute, and showed it confidentially to the Dutch\r\nrepresentative. Van Zuylen professed to be on the whole well satisfied\r\nwith Palmerston's proposals, and held out distinct hopes that they\r\nmight serve as the basis of a definite agreement between Holland and\r\nBelgium. But, before any progress could be made in the matter, it was\r\nnecessary to induce the Belgians to abandon their declared intention\r\nof refusing to negotiate, until the Dutch should have evacuated the\r\ncitadel of Antwerp. In order to try to persuade the Belgian government\r\nto adopt a less uncompromising attitude, Baron Stockmar, early in\r\nAugust, proceeded to Brussels as the semi-official representative\r\nof the conference. King Leopold's confidential adviser saw clearly\r\nthat the Belgians must appear in a very unfavourable light should the\r\nnegotiations break down, owing to their obstinate refusal to recede\r\nfrom the position they had taken up. He had never approved of the\r\npolicy of the Meulinäer Cabinet, and had always deprecated the warlike\r\npreparations upon which that minister had ostentatiously embarked.\r\nAs he constantly pointed out to the King, the chances of success in\r\na single-handed contest with Holland were necessarily very doubtful.\r\nMoreover, under any circumstances, the Great Powers were pledged to\r\nintervene to put an end to the struggle, and, in such a case, Belgium,\r\nif the aggressor, would certainly be dealt with very harshly. One\r\nmeasure, however, which Stockmar had constantly advocated, was now\r\nan accomplished fact. In the month of May, the Princess Louise, a\r\ndaughter of the King of the French, had been affianced to Leopold,\r\nand the marriage had been duly celebrated on August 9, at the Château\r\nde Compiègne. But the newly married king showed as little disposition\r\nto adopt the counsels of his father-in-law[239] as he had those of\r\nthe sagacious Stockmar. Indeed, the language of many leading Belgians\r\nat this period suggested that they were encouraged to defy the\r\nPowers, from the security which they considered was assured to them\r\nby the family ties uniting their sovereign to the reigning House in\r\nFrance.[240] Leopold, without doubt, had no share in so dangerous an\r\nillusion, but his ministers had pledged themselves to the Chambers\r\nto insist upon the surrender of Antwerp as a preliminary to any\r\nfresh negotiations, and he seems to have thought that it would\r\nbe too unpopular a step to dismiss them on that account. Stockmar\r\nreturned to London on August 18. His visit to Brussels had failed\r\nin its object, but he still continued to press his views upon King\r\nLeopold. A prolongation of the _status quo_ constituted, he argued,\r\nno disadvantage to Belgium. Although it was the case that the Dutch\r\nheld the citadel of Antwerp, which, by the terms of the treaty,\r\nshould have passed out of their possession, their retention of it\r\nwas counterbalanced by the Belgian occupation of parts of Limburg\r\nand Luxemburg, which, under the conditions of separation, had been\r\nassigned to Holland. Moreover, even the absolute Powers were prepared\r\nto admit that a continued refusal on the part of the Court of the\r\nHague to evacuate Antwerp, would justify the Belgians in declining\r\nto pay their share of the public debt, jointly contracted by the two\r\ncountries before their separation. Before long, the force of this\r\nreasoning began to be appreciated at Brussels, where both Adair and\r\nLa Tour-Maubourg, the British and French ministers, were using their\r\nbest endeavours to persuade the King to conform to the wishes of their\r\nrespective governments. In diplomatic circles the conviction was\r\ngaining ground that the King of the Netherlands was merely trifling\r\nwith the Powers, and that he had still no intention of bringing the\r\nnegotiations to a conclusion.[241] Should these suspicions prove\r\ncorrect, Leopold probably realized that it must be to his advantage to\r\ndisplay a readiness to meet the wishes of the conference, at a time\r\nwhen the members of it would necessarily be heartily disgusted at the\r\ndilatory and evasive attitude adopted by the Cabinet of the Hague.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of these various considerations his resolution\r\nrose to the required point.[242] The Meulinäer government was\r\ndismissed, General Goblet was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs,\r\nand powers were transmitted to Van de Weyer to enter into negotiations\r\nwith the Dutch plenipotentiary upon the basis of the new proposals,\r\n_Le thème de Lord Palmerston_, as they were called by the diplomatists.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on September 20, M. Van de Weyer officially informed\r\nthe conference that he was authorized to discuss with the Dutch\r\nplenipotentiaries the points in dispute between the two countries.\r\nBut in a note dated the same day, Van Zuylen, ignoring completely\r\nthe _thème de Lord Palmerston_, claimed the execution of the treaty\r\non the terms set forth in the Dutch counter proposal of June 30. The\r\nconference, thereupon, called upon him definitely to state whether\r\nhe was empowered to negotiate with Belgium in accordance with the\r\nproposals submitted by the British plenipotentiary. To this demand\r\nhe returned an answer which was unanimously held to be highly\r\nunsatisfactory, and, on October 1, in consequence, the representatives\r\nof the five Powers met to consider the steps which should now be\r\ntaken to bring matters to a conclusion. As had been foreseen, it was\r\nclear at once that the prospects of arriving at an agreement were\r\nhopeless. According to the absolute Powers, coercion must be confined\r\nto a declaration authorizing the Belgians to withhold payment of\r\ntheir share of the Dutch-Belgian debt, until the citadel of Antwerp\r\nshould be handed over to them. France and England, on the other hand,\r\nderiding the notion that pressure of this kind would suffice to\r\novercome the obstinacy of the King of the Netherlands, called for the\r\napplication of sterner measures. To this demand the plenipotentiaries\r\nof the northern Powers opposed the irrevocable resolution of their\r\nrespective Courts not to participate in any hostile acts against\r\nHolland. In face of this irreconcilable divergence of opinion, the\r\nconference broke up, the representatives of France and England\r\nannouncing the intention of their governments to take steps to ensure\r\nthe prompt execution of the terms of the separation treaty.[243]\r\n\r\nBut, although the concert of the Powers had thus ceased to exist,\r\nthere was still no distinct understanding between France and England,\r\nas to the measures by which the Dutch were to be compelled to evacuate\r\nAntwerp. Louis Philippe's continued inability to reconstruct his\r\nCabinet necessarily increased the reluctance of the British government\r\nto agree definitely to combined action with France. When, towards\r\nthe end of June, the King had become convinced of the necessity of\r\nstrengthening the ministry his thoughts, in the first place, had\r\nturned towards M. Dupin. His oratorical powers, the considerable\r\nfollowing which he commanded in the Chamber, and the support which he\r\nhad given to M. Casimir Périer, furnished excellent reasons for his\r\ninclusion in a government which was to carry on the policy of the late\r\nPresident of the Council. But insurmountable difficulties had arisen.\r\nIt is not clear whether M. Dupin's objections to joining the Cabinet\r\nshould be ascribed to conscientious doubts about the future policy of\r\nthe government, or merely to disappointed ambition, because the King\r\nwas not prepared to confer upon him the Presidency of the Council.\r\nAccording to one account, he is said to have pointed to his hobnailed\r\nboots and to have asked insolently whether they were to debar him from\r\ntransacting business with \"_Milord_ Granville.\" But, whatever may have\r\nbeen the true cause of his misunderstanding with his royal master,\r\ntheir discussion unquestionably grew very heated and culminated in the\r\nKing seizing him by the collar and ejecting him from the room.[244] A\r\nstrong sense of personal dignity, however, was never a characteristic\r\nof Louis Philippe, and, notwithstanding this scene, he soon reopened\r\nnegotiations with M. Dupin. But this second attempt to arrange\r\nmatters was attended with no better success than the first. Baffled\r\nin this direction, Louis Philippe was compelled to make overtures to\r\nthe _Doctrinaires_. Under the Restoration this designation had been\r\napplied to a small but distinguished group of politicians, of whom the\r\nbest known were Royer-Collard, Guizot, Broglie and Barante. All were\r\nstrong advocates of limited monarchy and, generally speaking, fervent\r\nadmirers of the British constitution. Their system of government was\r\nbased upon the theory that, in the modern France which the Revolution\r\nhad created, no _régime_ could endure which did not depend for support\r\nupon the middle classes. The political principles which found favour\r\nwith the _bourgeoisie_, constituting as they did a _juste milieu_\r\nbetween the reactionary sentiments of the old aristocracy and the\r\nrevolutionary tendencies of the labouring classes, were precisely\r\nthose to which, in the opinion of the _Doctrinaires_, all future\r\ngovernments would have to conform. Accordingly, they had accepted\r\nthe Monarchy of July and both Broglie and Guizot had sat in Louis\r\nPhilippe's first Cabinet. But, holding that insurrection must be put\r\ndown with a firm hand, they had always supported Casimir Périer.\r\n\r\nLouis Philippe had no great liking for the _Doctrinaires_. As strict\r\nconstitutionalists they were necessarily opposed to the direct\r\ninterference of the sovereign with the business of the State.\r\nMoreover, they were unquestionably unpopular in the country. On this\r\noccasion, however, when compelled by circumstances to seek their\r\nassistance, he hoped to overcome this last objection by nominating\r\na popular soldier, in the person of Marshal Soult, to the presidency\r\nof the council. All through his reign Louis Philippe was inclined to\r\nplace a military man at the head of the government. Not only were\r\nappointments of this kind invariably well received, but he soon\r\ndiscovered that soldiers, brought up in the school of Bonaparte,\r\nwere seldom troubled with constitutional scruples about the exact\r\nposition of the sovereign in a limited monarchy. But, at the same\r\ntime, he was careful to assure Lord Granville that the Marshal's\r\nduties, as President of the Council, would be purely nominal. \"Under\r\nany circumstances,\" said Louis Philippe, \"his appointment need excite\r\nno apprehensions abroad, his love of peace is notorious, indeed, his\r\ndescription of himself as _l'apôtre de la paix_ has almost passed into\r\na byword.\"[245] The Duc de Broglie, the son-in-law of Madame de Stael,\r\ninto whose hands the King proposed to confide the portfolio of Foreign\r\nAffairs, was a cultivated man but of reserved and somewhat displeasing\r\nmanners. He enjoyed, however, a high reputation for honourable dealing\r\nand integrity of purpose and was, moreover, on terms of friendship\r\nwith Lord Lansdowne and other prominent members of the Whig party.\r\nHis selection, therefore, might be expected to meet with the cordial\r\napproval of the British government.\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Broglie, however, was not prepared to accept\r\nunconditionally the task which the King proposed he should undertake.\r\nAfter one of his first interviews with Louis Philippe he met Lord\r\nGranville at Talleyrand's house in the Rue Saint-Florentin and\r\nexplained the situation to him. The French public, he told the\r\nambassador, were weary of the interminable negotiations about Belgium,\r\nand it was only by a military exploit, such as the capture of the\r\ncitadel of Antwerp, that the Cabinet would be able to obtain the\r\nsupport of the Chamber. It was useless to attempt to disguise the\r\ngrave character of the situation. Were the government to be overthrown\r\nby a parliamentary majority, the King would be forced to depend upon\r\nthe Left, and be rendered powerless to control the violence of extreme\r\nmembers of the party. The Duke went on to assure him that he was\r\nnot ignorant of the suspicion with which the entry of a French army\r\ninto Belgium would be regarded. There was no pledge, no guarantee,\r\nhowever, which he would not be prepared to give that, eight days after\r\nthe capture of the citadel, every French soldier should be withdrawn\r\nfrom Belgium.[246] This conversation had been regarded by Lord\r\nGranville as quite unofficial, but, on the following day, October 5,\r\nSébastiani informed him that \"the King purposed to defer concluding\r\nhis ministerial arrangements until the British ambassador should\r\nbe enabled to state the opinion of his government, respecting the\r\nconditions under which alone the Duc de Broglie would undertake the\r\ndirection of foreign affairs.\"[247] It is evident, however, that other\r\ncounsels must have prevailed seeing that, on the morning of October\r\n11, the _Moniteur_ contained the names of the members of the new\r\nCabinet. The despatches of Mareuil, the _chargé d'affaires_ in London,\r\nrespecting the intentions of the British government, were, it may be\r\npresumed, considered so satisfactory as to render further assurances\r\nunnecessary. The ministry presided over by Marshal Soult, assisted by\r\nfour such men as Broglie, Guizot, Humann, and Thiers, could almost\r\naspire to the name of \"a government of all the talents.\"\r\n\r\nThe British government was in a difficult situation. The elections\r\nwere impending, and a Reformed Parliament, bent upon retrenchment and\r\nthe settlement of domestic questions, was little likely to regard\r\nwith favour any policy which might conceivably lead to serious\r\ncomplications with foreign Powers. The very indifferent display of the\r\nBelgians, in their short campaign of the year before, had deprived\r\nthem of all popular sympathy. In commercial circles, especially, the\r\nidea of embarking upon hostilities against England's old allies,\r\nthe Dutch, was strongly deprecated.[248] Although the unreasonable\r\nattitude of the King of the Netherlands, during the past twelve\r\nmonths, had alienated from him the support of _The Times_[249] and\r\nof many persons who derived their opinions from its columns, there\r\nwas unquestionably something to be said upon his behalf. He had\r\nadhered to the protocols of January 20 and January 27, 1831, which the\r\nplenipotentiaries had declared must form the basis of any separation\r\ntreaty. Nevertheless, in order to conciliate the Belgians, they had\r\ngone back upon their decision, and both the convention of the eighteen\r\narticles and the separation treaty of November 14, 1831, had been\r\nframed upon different conditions.\r\n\r\nThe Tories had always supported the Dutch, and during the stormy\r\nmonths which had preceded the passing of the Reform Bill, had\r\ndelivered some damaging attacks upon the foreign policy of the\r\ngovernment. It was certain that they would vehemently denounce any\r\ncombined action with France in the Dutch-Belgian question. Nor\r\nwould it be politic to disregard their attacks and merely to treat\r\nthem as the venomous outburst of party animosity. Notwithstanding\r\nthat the republicans had been crushed in the streets of Paris and\r\nthat the Carlist rebellion in La Vendée had been stamped out, the\r\nsituation in France undoubtedly presented many disquieting symptoms.\r\nThe hiding place of the Duchesse de Berri was still undiscovered,\r\nand her presence in the west prevented the complete restoration\r\nof tranquillity. The great difficulty which Louis Philippe was\r\nexperiencing in forming a government of moderate men afforded food\r\nfor yet more serious reflection. The possibility could not be ignored\r\nthat, in the near future, he might be compelled to select his\r\nministers from the Left--from the party, the leading members of which\r\nproclaimed unceasingly that the treaties of 1815 must be abrogated and\r\nthat Belgium must be united to France.\r\n\r\nKing William IV., moreover, was strongly opposed to hostile action\r\nagainst Holland. The \"Jack Tar animosity\"[250] which he always\r\nentertained for the French blazed up afresh at the notion of England\r\nand France engaging upon joint operations in the Low Countries. The\r\nKing's dislike to the policy of his ministers was encouraged by the\r\nHowes and the Fitzclarences,[251] who used their best endeavours to\r\npersuade him to refuse his consent to all measures of coercion. In\r\nview of the little sympathy which the cause of Belgium evoked in the\r\ncountry, and of the many difficulties by which they were beset, Lords\r\nGrey and Palmerston might not improbably have felt disposed to adopt\r\nsome middle course, more in harmony with the views of the Court and\r\nof the absolute Powers. But a refusal on their part to resort to\r\nforce, in order to obtain the execution of the treaty, would not have\r\nrestrained the French from beginning hostilities. \"I should deceive\r\nyour Lordship,\" wrote Granville on October 19, \"were I to hold out\r\nany expectation that the British government, by withholding its\r\nconcurrence, could prevent a French army from entering Belgium.\"[252]\r\nIt was to be apprehended, however, that a refusal of the English\r\nCabinet to join with France in the application of coercion to Holland\r\nmight lead to the resignation of the Duc de Broglie. In that case\r\nit was more than probable that the direction of French policy, at a\r\nmost important moment, might pass from the hands of a statesman of\r\nmoderate views into those of some politician of advanced opinions, in\r\nwhom it would be impossible to feel the same confidence. This was a\r\nconsideration which, without doubt, carried the greatest weight with\r\nthe English ministers and exercised a deciding influence over their\r\nresolutions.\r\n\r\nIt was soon apparent that the withdrawal of their plenipotentiaries\r\nfrom the conference would be the extent of the support which the\r\nNorthern Courts purposed to give to the King of the Netherlands.\r\nThe neutral attitude, which the Tsar had promised Lord Durham he\r\nshould adopt, rendered it certain that Austria would not move a man\r\nto the assistance of Holland. Metternich was much concerned at the\r\nrecrudescence of a demand for more Liberal institutions in Germany, a\r\nstate of affairs which had called forth from the Diet fresh decrees\r\nof a repressive character. The prevailing unrest, however, made it\r\nthe more desirable that the Dutch-Belgian question, with all the\r\npossibilities of danger attaching to it, should be promptly settled.\r\nFurthermore, the burden of military establishments was already\r\ngrievously straining the Imperial exchequer.[253] But, although\r\nMetternich had no thought of opposing the action of the constitutional\r\nPowers in the Low Countries, he chafed bitterly at the undignified\r\nattitude which his Court was compelled to adopt. At one time he would\r\nimpute the whole blame for the situation which had arisen to the\r\nplenipotentiaries at the conference who, by manifesting too plainly\r\ntheir dread of war, had allowed Palmerston to see that he might,\r\nwithout danger, conduct matters as he chose.[254] At other times\r\nthe Cabinet of Berlin was the object of his fretful complaints. Had\r\nPrussia on the first outbreak of the insurrection at Brussels marched\r\nan army into the Low Countries, the revolution would have been stamped\r\nout, and all the subsequent trouble would have been avoided. France,\r\nin that case, he professed to believe, might have threatened, but\r\nwould never have dared to intervene.[255]\r\n\r\nThe break-up of the conference and the intention avowed by the two\r\nconstitutional Powers of expelling the Dutch from Antwerp, although\r\nnot unexpected, caused considerable perturbation at Berlin. Ancillon,\r\nthe chief minister, declared that Prussia would agree to the weekly\r\ndeduction of a million florins from Belgium's share of the debt\r\ndue to Holland, for so long a period as the Dutch should retain\r\npossession of the citadel of Antwerp. Nor would his Court be prepared\r\nseriously to oppose a blockade of the Scheldt by the two maritime\r\nPowers. The entry of a French army into the Low Countries, however,\r\nwas a different matter, and one which would compel Prussia to take\r\nsteps to safeguard her interests. But, neither the angry language of\r\nM. Ancillon at Berlin nor the veiled threats indulged in by Baron\r\nWerther in Paris, excited any real apprehension. Nevertheless, as\r\nboth the French and English governments were sincerely desirous of\r\nconciliating the absolute Powers, it was resolved to propose that,\r\npending the settlement of the Dutch-Belgian question, Prussia should\r\noccupy Venlo and that part of Limburg which the treaty had assigned to\r\nHolland.[256]\r\n\r\nIt was not until October 22 that the convention, to regulate the\r\nconditions under which France and England were to apply coercion\r\nto Holland, was signed in London. The French government chafed\r\nimpatiently at this delay, for which King William's reluctance\r\nto agree to the measures advocated by his ministers was chiefly\r\nresponsible. Notwithstanding Talleyrand's[257] explanations of the\r\ndelicate situation in which Lord Grey was placed, the Duc de Broglie,\r\non October 21, informed Lord Granville that his government could wait\r\nno longer. The very existence of the Cabinet, he assured him, was at\r\nstake. Unless he were to be in a position to announce to the Chambers,\r\nwhich were about to reassemble, that definite steps were to be taken\r\nin order to expel the Dutch from Antwerp, he and his colleagues would\r\nassuredly be driven from office. If no news were received from London\r\nwithin the next twenty-four hours, the Cabinet, he had no doubt,\r\nwould resolve to march an army against Antwerp, in the event of the\r\nKing of the Netherlands refusing to comply with a summons to evacuate\r\nthe citadel. This resolution would, however, be at once transmitted\r\nto London, and would be kept entirely secret until the British\r\ngovernment should have had time to reply to it. But, to the great\r\njoy of Louis Philippe and his ministers, the arrival, on October 29,\r\nof the convention signed in London relieved them from the necessity\r\nof deciding upon their course of action, without having previously\r\nobtained the concurrence of the English government.[258]\r\n\r\nBy the terms of the convention of October 22, 1832, the King of the\r\nNetherlands was to be summoned to enter into an engagement by November\r\n2 to withdraw his troops, before the 12th of the same month, from the\r\nterritory which the separation treaty had adjudged to Belgium. Should\r\nhe refuse to comply, France and England agreed to lay an embargo\r\nupon the Dutch shipping within their respective harbours, to order\r\ntheir cruisers to seize all Dutch vessels at sea, and to blockade the\r\ncoast of Holland with their combined fleets. If, by November 15, the\r\nrequired evacuation should not yet have taken place, a French army\r\nwould enter Belgium. But its operations were to be limited strictly to\r\nthe capture of the citadel of Antwerp and the forts dependent upon it,\r\nand, when this result should have been attained, it was to withdraw\r\nimmediately. At the same time, a note was to be addressed to the\r\ngovernment at Brussels calling for the evacuation of Venlo and those\r\nplaces still occupied by Belgium, which, under the provisions of the\r\nseparation treaty, had been assigned to Holland.[259] This demand,\r\nhowever, would be of a purely formal character, and was to be made\r\nupon the understanding that it need only be complied with, should the\r\nKing of the Netherlands agree to the concessions required of him.[260]\r\n\r\nImmediately upon receipt of the convention in Paris, the French\r\nfleet at Cherbourg was ordered to unite with the British squadron at\r\nSpithead. This junction was duly effected, and, on November 4, the\r\nKing of the Netherlands having declined to comply with the demand\r\nwhich had been presented to him, the combined fleets set sail for\r\nthe mouth of the Scheldt, whilst, two days later, both governments\r\nlaid an embargo upon the Dutch shipping within their ports. The Duc\r\nde Broglie, in the meanwhile, had instructed La Tour-Maubourg, the\r\nFrench minister at Brussels, to negotiate a convention for the entry\r\nof a French army into Belgium. The French government had always\r\ninsisted that the operations, for the reduction of the citadel of\r\nAntwerp, must be carried out exclusively by its own troops. The\r\nBelgian army was to be entirely separated from them, and was to\r\ndo no more than hold itself in readiness to repel an invasion,\r\nshould the Dutch make an incursion across their frontiers. King\r\nLeopold reluctantly assented to these conditions, which necessarily\r\ndeprived his people of an excellent opportunity of wiping out their\r\nhumiliations of the year before. It came, therefore, as a disagreeable\r\nsurprise when, on the occasion of the exchange of the ratifications of\r\nthe convention, La Tour-Maubourg handed in a statement reserving to\r\nthe French government the right of demanding payment for the expenses\r\nof the expedition. This claim, it was afterwards explained, would not\r\nbe enforced immediately, but would be allowed to stand over until\r\nsome future occasion. In Palmerston's opinion, however, the fact that\r\npayment was to be deferred made the demand no less objectionable. Were\r\nit to be admitted, Belgium must necessarily be placed in a position of\r\ndangerous dependence upon France. His vigorous protests achieved the\r\ndesired result. After some discussion the French government agreed to\r\nabandon its claim for the repayment of its expenses.[261] In all other\r\nrespects matters proceeded with perfect smoothness. In accordance\r\nwith the terms of the convention, on November 16th, a French force of\r\n60,000 men, under the command of Marshal Gérard, crossed the Belgian\r\nfrontier and laid siege to the citadel of Antwerp, the Duc d'Orléans\r\nand the Duc de Nemours, the two eldest sons of Louis Philippe,\r\naccompanying the headquarters staff of the army of operations.\r\n\r\nIn London the application of coercion of so vigorous a nature was\r\nfar from evoking the universal applause which it called forth in\r\nParis. Among the general public the entry of Marshal Gérard's army\r\ninto Belgium was regarded with suspicion, and a meeting of London\r\nmerchants was held, and a petition was forwarded to the King, praying\r\nthat hostile measures might not be taken against the Dutch. The\r\nTories openly declared that they placed all their hopes in General\r\nChassé, the commandant of the citadel of Antwerp. If only that gallant\r\nofficer could contrive to repel the French, the Grey Cabinet, they\r\nconceived, might be forced to resign. Possibly there were sanguine\r\nmembers of the party who fancied that the prowess of a Dutch general\r\nmight pave the way to the repeal of the Reform Act. In the meantime\r\nall their sympathies went out to a drunken sailor who, from the dock\r\nin the police-court, proclaimed the union of the British flag with the\r\ntricolour to be a national disgrace.[262]\r\n\r\nThe proposal that Prussia should occupy Venlo and parts of Limburg,\r\nand the limitations which the convention of October 22 set upon the\r\nscope of the French operations, somewhat reconciled the German Powers\r\nto the forcible ejection of the Dutch from Antwerp.[263] Nevertheless,\r\nafter having in the first instance declared its readiness to take\r\ntemporary possession of portions of the disputed territory, the\r\nCourt of Berlin, at the instigation, it was suspected, of the Tsar,\r\ndeclined to entertain the suggestion. Inasmuch as the acquisition of\r\nthe citadel of Antwerp by the Belgians depended upon the success of\r\nthe French arms, they could not reasonably be expected to yield up,\r\neven to a third party, any territory which they actually occupied,\r\nbefore the operations under Marshal Gérard should have achieved their\r\ndesired result. Accordingly, in the formal proposal of Talleyrand\r\nand Palmerston, which was submitted to Bülow on October 30, it was\r\nprovided that the Prussian occupation of Venlo and parts of Limburg\r\nand Luxemburg should begin, only when the French expedition should\r\nhave accomplished its object. Ancillon, however, declared that\r\nthis suggestion was altogether inadmissible. Prussia, it was true,\r\nhad signified her willingness to hold certain districts of the Low\r\nCountries. But she had only consented to take temporary possession\r\nof them for the security of her own interests during the French\r\noperations against Antwerp. To occupy any portion of Holland, after\r\nthe withdrawal of Marshal Gérard's army, would amount, in effect, to\r\nthe application of military pressure to the King of the Netherlands\r\nto compel him to accept the conditions of the separation treaty.\r\nSuch a proceeding would be wholly inconsistent with the policy which\r\nthe Court of Berlin had invariably pursued, and to which it was\r\nresolved to adhere. Prussia, therefore, would content herself with the\r\nconcentration of an army of observation upon the Meuse, for so long a\r\nperiod as the French might see fit to remain in Belgium.[264]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the siege of the citadel of Antwerp had been\r\nproceeding steadily, although hardly with the rapidity which the\r\nBritish government, in its impatience to see the affair concluded,\r\ncould have wished.[265] At last, after having sustained a very heavy\r\nbombardment and having done all that honour required, General Chassé,\r\non December 22, agreed to surrender. But the two detached forts of\r\nLillo and Liefkenshoek, which, owing to the opening of the dykes,\r\ncould only have been reduced by a long blockade, were not included in\r\nthe capitulation. The arrangements connected with the transference of\r\nthe fortress to the Belgian military authorities were quickly carried\r\nout, and, on December 27, the French army began its homeward march.\r\n\r\nThe operations of Marshal Gérard had placed the Belgians in possession\r\nof the citadel of Antwerp, and had infused vitality into the Soult\r\ngovernment, but they had not succeeded in overcoming the reluctance\r\nof the King of the Netherlands to adhere to the separation treaty.\r\nIt remained to be seen whether the embargo which France and England\r\ncontinued to maintain, and the loss entailed by the non-payment of\r\nthe Belgian share of the Netherlands debt, would suffice to break\r\ndown his obstinacy. After this state of affairs had continued for\r\nsome four months distinct symptoms began to manifest themselves in\r\nDutch commercial circles of discontent at the prolongation of the\r\ncrisis. About this same time also the Russian and Prussian Cabinets\r\nbecame imbued with the notion that the conclusion of the Dutch-Belgian\r\naffair might lead to a separation between France and England. Their\r\nintimate union had grown up in the course of the negotiations, the\r\nfinal settlement of the question, it was hoped, might cause them to\r\ndrift asunder. The agents of the northern Courts at the Hague were,\r\naccordingly, instructed to urge the King to terminate definitely his\r\ntroublesome quarrel with Belgium and the maritime Powers.[266]\r\n\r\nThis combination of internal and external pressure was more than the\r\nDutch Cabinet could withstand. On May 21, 1833 a convention was signed\r\nin London by the plenipotentiaries of Holland, on the one side, and\r\nthose of Great Britain and France, on the other, stipulating that,\r\nso long as the relations between Holland and Belgium should not be\r\nsettled by a definite treaty, His Netherlands Majesty would never\r\nbegin hostilities against Belgium, and would leave the navigation\r\nof the Scheldt entirely free. France and England in return engaged\r\nto remove the embargo, immediately upon the ratification of this\r\nconvention.[267]\r\n\r\nThe convention of May 21, 1833, was, in effect, an agreement for\r\nthe maintenance of the _status quo_. It constituted, however, a\r\ncondition of affairs very favourable to the Belgians. The retention\r\nof the districts of Limburg and Luxemburg, which, according to the\r\ntwenty-four articles, should have formed part of Holland, compensated\r\nthem amply for the small inconveniences imposed upon them by the\r\nrefusal of the Court of the Hague to acknowledge their independence\r\nand the sovereignty of their King. Five years later, in 1838, this\r\nfact was brought home to them when, the King of the Netherlands having\r\nannounced his intention of adhering to the separation treaty, the\r\nPowers insisted upon the surrender to him of those territories. By\r\nthat time, however, Leopold had obtained the recognition of all the\r\ngreat European Courts with the exception of that of Russia, whilst,\r\nrelieved from the fear of aggression on the part of the Dutch, his\r\nkingdom had already begun to thrive and to prosper greatly.\r\n\r\nIt was the firm and skilful hand of Palmerston which had guided the\r\nconference through a sea of dangers to the creation of a free and\r\nindependent Belgium. But if the chief credit for the successful\r\ntermination of these protracted negotiations should be given to the\r\nEnglish statesman, second honours, without doubt, should be assigned\r\nto Talleyrand. The veteran diplomatist was no friend to Belgium, but\r\nhe was a consistent supporter of the British alliance. The exceptional\r\nposition, which his age and his reputation permitted him to assume,\r\nenabled him on many occasions to uphold successfully the English\r\npolicy against his own sovereign and his government. In 1814, at the\r\nCongress of Vienna, friendship with England had been the object of\r\nhis untiring efforts. But, if he looked upon a close understanding\r\nwith that Power as highly advantageous to the restored Bourbons, he\r\nregarded it as a matter of vital necessity to the Monarchy of July. An\r\nintimate union with England, he was convinced, was Louis Philippe's\r\nbest security against the malevolent hostility of the Northern Courts.\r\n\r\nThe Belgian conference had shown that, in the person of Lord\r\nPalmerston, a worthy successor to Canning had entered the arena of\r\nEuropean politics. As was the case with that statesman, Palmerston\r\nsoon came to be regarded with the bitterest dislike in the Courts and\r\nCabinets of the absolute Powers. Metternich hoped devoutly that the\r\nTories might soon be back in office, and, not without good reason,\r\nexpressed a pious wish that never again might a conference take\r\nplace in London.[268] The real weakness of the absolute Courts had\r\ntranspired all too clearly in the course of the negotiations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                             MEHEMET ALI\r\n\r\n\r\nScarcely had the withdrawal of the French troops from Belgium been\r\neffected, than grave news was received from the east. At Konieh,\r\nin Asia Minor, on December 21, 1832, Ibrahim Pasha, the son of\r\nMehemet Ali, the rebellious viceroy of Egypt, was reported to have\r\ninflicted so signal a defeat upon the Turkish army, as to place it\r\nbeyond the Sultan's power to resist his advance to the shores of the\r\nBosphorus. The dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, with all the fearful\r\ncomplications which it would entail, appeared to be upon the point of\r\ntaking place.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan, Mahmud II., had always been keenly alive to the necessity\r\nof remedying the decrepit condition of his Empire. But only a Peter\r\nthe Great could have eradicated effectually the many evils from which\r\nTurkey was suffering, and Mahmud was merely an Oriental despot. All\r\nthrough his reign, however, he set himself resolutely to destroy the\r\nalmost independent power which some of his Pashas had begun to assume\r\nover the provinces which they governed. He imposed the European dress\r\nupon his ministers and officials, he introduced the French system of\r\ndrill into his army, and he exterminated the janissaries, when they\r\nrebelled against his innovations. Even at a time of profound peace\r\nreforms of this superficial character could have effected little\r\nreal improvement. Under the actual conditions under which they were\r\ncarried out they proved a cause of anarchy and a further source of\r\nweakness to the State.\r\n\r\nIn 1821 the Sublime Porte was called upon to deal at the same time\r\nwith the rebellion of Ali, the celebrated \"Lion of Janina,\" and with\r\nthe more serious national rising of the Greeks. After the struggle in\r\nthe Morea had been carried on for three years, with ruthless barbarity\r\non both sides, the Sultan was reluctantly compelled to invoke the\r\naid of his too powerful vassal, the Pasha of Egypt. The intervention\r\nof the well-equipped fleet of Mehemet Ali deprived the Greeks of the\r\nsea power, which had been the secret of their success. Nevertheless,\r\nIbrahim's invasion of the Morea in 1825, by compelling the Powers\r\nto interfere, gave Greece her independence. The romantic episodes\r\nof the struggle, the classic memories with which the theatre of war\r\nwas associated, had gained for the insurgents the popular sympathies\r\nof the western nations. The philhellenism of the French and English\r\npeople gradually drove Villèle[269] and Canning to concert measures\r\nfor terminating the conflict with Nicholas, whose subjects were eager\r\nto strike a blow on behalf of their co-religionists.\r\n\r\nNegotiations proceeded slowly, but, on July 6, 1827, Great Britain,\r\nFrance and Russia bound themselves by treaty to obtain the autonomy\r\nof the Morea. Moreover, in a secret article, it was provided that\r\nan armistice was to be proposed to both sides to be enforced by\r\nsuch means as might \"suggest themselves to the prudence of the High\r\nContracting Parties.\" Three months later, on October 20, the allied\r\nfleets of the three Christian Powers, under the command of Codrington,\r\nthe senior admiral, were face to face with the Mussulman armada in the\r\nBay of Navarino. Immediate hostilities were probably not intended,\r\nbut a dispute about the position of a fire-ship led to an exchange\r\nof shots. Before nightfall the \"untoward event\" had come to pass--the\r\nTurkish and Egyptian fleets had been destroyed completely.\r\n\r\nMahmud in his fury proclaimed a holy war, and declared null and void\r\nthe convention of Akkerman, which he had recently concluded with\r\nRussia for the settlement of certain points, long in dispute between\r\nthe two Powers. Canning was dead and Wellington was determined to\r\nabstain rigidly from anything in the nature of hostile action against\r\nTurkey. Nevertheless, under the conditions which had been created by\r\nCanning's departure from the traditional policy of his party, he could\r\ndo nothing to prevent Nicholas from appealing to the last argument\r\nof princes. On May 6, 1828, the Russians crossed the Pruth and the\r\nwar began, which British and Austrian diplomacy had always striven\r\nto avert. The Turks, however, in a struggle with their hereditary\r\nfoes displayed unexpected powers of resistance, and it was not until\r\nSeptember 14, 1829, when Constantinople appeared to lie at the mercy\r\nof the invaders, that peace was concluded at Adrianople.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with his promises to the Powers, Nicholas had exacted\r\nno cession of territory in Europe. But Turkey had been compelled to\r\ngrant a practical independence to the Danubian principalities, to pay\r\na heavy war indemnity and to surrender to Russia Anapi and Poti on\r\nthe eastern shore of the Black Sea. Moreover, the Sultan was forced\r\nto acknowledge the complete independence of Greece, which was placed\r\nunder the guarantee of Great Britain, France and Russia. The loss of\r\nthe Morea was a serious blow to the Porte. Not only was the Turkish\r\nnavy deprived of its finest recruiting ground, but the countenance\r\ngiven by the Powers to the rising of the Greeks necessarily had a most\r\ndisturbing effect upon all the Christian subjects of the Sultan.\r\n\r\nWhilst the power of the Sultan was thus sensibly diminished, Mehemet\r\nAli, who had taken no part in the Russian war, was preparing to avail\r\nhimself of the embarrassed condition of the Empire for the prosecution\r\nof his own designs. This remarkable man was born at Cawala, a small\r\nseaport town in Roumelia, in 1769, the year which gave birth to\r\nNapoleon Bonaparte and to Wellington. His father was a yeoman farmer\r\nand he himself, in early life, was a small trader in tobacco. In 1798,\r\nhowever, Bonaparte's descent upon Egypt gave him his opportunity.\r\nYoung Ali sailed for the country in which he was so rapidly to acquire\r\nfame, in the rank of second-in-command to a regiment of Bashi-Bazouks.\r\nIn the troublous times which followed, his military talents and his\r\nstatesmanlike qualities soon brought him into prominence. In 1804, the\r\nsheikhs of Cairo elected him Pasha, and, two years later, a, _firman_\r\nof the Sultan confirmed their selection. The last obstacle to his\r\ncomplete ascendency over Egypt was removed, on March 1, 1811, by the\r\nterrible affair known as the massacre of the Mamelukes. The Beys and\r\nchiefs, to the number of 470, were invited to witness the ceremony of\r\ninvesting his second son with the command of the army destined for\r\noperations against the Wahabites. These men versed in all the wiles\r\nand stratagems of eastern politics complied, and walked blindly into\r\nthe trap set for them by one who, they must have known, was their\r\ndeadly enemy. On leaving the citadel of Cairo they were relentlessly\r\nshot down by a picked body of the Pasha's Albanian troops, at a point\r\nwhere the road becomes a narrow winding pathway cut out of the rock.\r\nAlone Emin Bey, by blindfolding his horse and by forcing him through a\r\ngap and down a high, precipitous bank, succeeded in escaping from the\r\nscene of slaughter.[270]\r\n\r\nDuring the next few years Mehemet Ali won a high reputation in the\r\nMoslem world by his wars against the Wahabites, and by his deliverance\r\nof the Holy Cities of Medina and Mecca from these enemies of the\r\ntrue faith. He had always entertained a great liking and admiration\r\nfor Europeans, and his experience of French and English troops had\r\nimpressed him with the superiority of western over eastern methods.\r\nAs early as 1803 he had begun to build up a fleet, and with the\r\nassistance of Colonel Sèves, known in Egypt as Soliman Pasha, a former\r\naide-de-camp of Marshal Ney, he hoped to obtain an army trained and\r\ndisciplined on a European model. His efforts had been so far crowned\r\nwith success, that, but for the intervention of the Powers, his son\r\nIbrahim would, unquestionably, have crushed the Greek rebellion.\r\n\r\nMehemet Ali's curious experiment in state socialism can be discussed\r\nmore conveniently later on. Suffice it to say that, unsound as was\r\nhis economic system, and destined as it was largely to contribute to\r\nhis ultimate undoing, it, for a time, furnished him with ample funds\r\nfor the prosecution of his ambitious schemes. By nature he appears\r\nto have been rather a kind-hearted than a cruel man. To some extent,\r\nwithout doubt, he was an oppressor of the people, yet at the same time\r\nhe constantly protected them from the ill-treatment and exactions\r\nof his officials. But, although he was too large-minded to find any\r\nsatisfaction in useless tyranny, when he conceived that reasons of\r\nstate called for their application, he would resort unhesitatingly\r\nto the most ruthless measures.[271] In passing judgment on Mehemet\r\nAli, however, it must always be remembered that he was an altogether\r\nilliterate man, who had only taught himself to read in middle life by\r\ndint of great perseverance. Nor should it be forgotten that Egypt,\r\nwhen he assumed the supreme control, was in a state of confusion and\r\nanarchy almost impossible to realize.\r\n\r\nIt was not loyalty which had prompted Mehemet Ali to assist the Porte\r\nto crush the Greek insurrection. In 1822 he had obtained the island of\r\nCrete from the Sultan, and the Morea and the pashalics of Syria and\r\nDamascus were to have been his rewards in 1825. The intervention of\r\nthe Powers had deprived him of the Morea, which he had always regarded\r\nas one of the gates of Constantinople. After the Russo-Turkish war,\r\nhowever, he felt confident of his ability to take forcible possession\r\nof Syria, the eastern avenue of approach to the Imperial city. A\r\nquarrel with Abdullah Pasha of Acre furnished him with an excuse for\r\nsetting his army and his fleet in motion. On November 1, 1831, a force\r\nof about 10,000 Egyptians, under Ibrahim, entered Syria and laid siege\r\nto the fortress of Saint-Jean d'Acre.\r\n\r\nTo the commissioner of the Porte sent to remonstrate with him for\r\nthus invading a neighbouring pashalic, without the permission of the\r\nSultan, Mehemet Ali loudly protested the loyalty of his intentions.\r\nThe presumptuous Abdullah, he swore, had \"insulted his beard whitened\r\nin the service of his sovereign,\" and, in the interests of the Porte,\r\nhe now proposed to chastise his arrogance. These assurances were,\r\nhowever, estimated at their true value, and neither the Sultan nor\r\nhis ministers had had any doubts that the Pasha was now launched\r\nupon a career of conquest.[272] The destruction of his powerful\r\nvassal had, for many years past, been an object very near to Mahmud's\r\nheart. To accomplish this purpose, he was prepared to strain to their\r\nuttermost the exhausted resources of the empire. His favourite,\r\nHosrew, the _Seraskier_,[273] was the sworn enemy of Mehemet Ali,\r\nand both the Grand Vizier and the _Capudan Pasha_[274] were the\r\ncreatures of this minister.[275] On the other hand, however, the\r\n_Ulemas_ and the _Mullahs_ argued in favour of an arrangement with\r\nthe rebellious viceroy, even at the price of large concessions. The\r\nthree guaranteeing Powers had settled upon the boundaries of the new\r\nKingdom of Greece, and Sir Stratford Canning was about to arrive at\r\nConstantinople to arrange the final conditions of separation with\r\nthe Porte. But, were peace to be maintained with the Pasha of Egypt,\r\ncontended the true Mussulman party, a united front could be turned to\r\nEurope, and the concessions demanded, in respect of Greece, might be\r\nscornfully rejected.[276]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding his wrath, this consideration appears to have carried\r\nsome weight with the Sultan. But his hesitation was not of long\r\nduration. Hussein Pasha, a former janissary, and Mahmud's chief\r\ninstrument in the destruction of his comrades, was appointed to the\r\ncommand of the troops in Syria. No pains were spared to render the\r\narmy of operations as efficient and as numerous as possible, and,\r\nearly in May, both Mehemet Ali and Ibrahim were declared outlaws.\r\nMeanwhile, the siege of Acre had been proceeding, but the defence was\r\nstubborn, and it was not until May 27, 1832, that Ibrahim carried the\r\nfortress by storm. The victorious general now set his face northwards.\r\nOn June 15, Damascus opened its gates, and, on July 9, he defeated the\r\nadvanced Turkish troops at Homs. A week later, he entered Aleppo, and,\r\non July 29, routed Hussein Pasha himself, who had taken up a strong\r\nposition near Alexandretta. This victory left him free to pass the\r\nTaurus mountains and to enter Asia Minor.\r\n\r\nIt was to the politic attitude which he had observed towards the\r\npeople of the country through which he had passed, rather than to any\r\nsuperiority of his Arab troops over the Turks, that the success of\r\nIbrahim's invasion should be ascribed. In those wild and mountainous\r\ndistricts any resistance on the part of the inhabitants must have\r\ngreatly impeded the advance of an army. Ibrahim, however, maintained\r\nthe strictest discipline, and paid promptly for all the requirements\r\nof his troops. The people, contrasting his behaviour with the\r\ntreatment they had been accustomed to experience at the hands of the\r\nTurks, were strongly impressed in favour of the Egyptians.[277] The\r\nEmir Beshir, the powerful chief of the Lebanon, threw in his lot with\r\nthe invaders. The warlike Druses and the Maronites tendered Ibrahim\r\ntheir services. Christians were won over by promises of equal rights,\r\nand Moslems by the prospect of escaping from Ottoman oppression.\r\nIbrahim's troops were equipped in European fashion, but there was\r\nnothing about their uniform which could offend the most rigid\r\nMussulman. He himself was dressed in the same simple manner as his\r\nsoldiers, and he affected always to be a strict observer of Turkish\r\ncustoms. Although in private, in the company of the Christian officers\r\nof his staff, he would often indulge freely in French wine, in public\r\nhe was never seen to drink anything stronger than water.[278]\r\n\r\nIbrahim's rapid succession of victories and his continued advance\r\nfilled the Sultan with consternation. Having resolved to throw all the\r\nresources of the Empire into the struggle with Mehemet Ali he could\r\nnot afford to quarrel with the Christian Powers. Stratford Canning,\r\naccordingly, experienced little difficulty in bringing the Porte\r\nto agree to the conditions under which it was proposed that Greece\r\nshould be separated from Turkey. Soon after his arrival, however, on\r\nMay 17, in the course of a confidential talk, Mustafa-Effendi, the\r\nSultan's private secretary, let fall certain expressions indicative of\r\na desire on the part of his master to enter into a close and intimate\r\nconnection with England.[279] On August 7, 1832, on the occasion of\r\nSir Stratford's audience for the purpose of taking leave, the Sultan\r\n\"honoured him with the gift of his portrait suspended by a gold\r\nchain and set in brilliants,\" a mark of His Highness' consideration\r\nwhich, the ambassador reported, \"was without precedent.\"[280]\r\nDirect proposals for the conclusion of an alliance between England\r\nand Turkey were immediately afterwards made to him both by the\r\n_Reis-Effendi_[281] and by the Sultan himself.[282] Furthermore, M.\r\nMaurojeni, the Turkish _chargé d'affaires_ at Vienna, was sent to\r\nLondon to sound the British government upon the subject, and, on\r\nOctober 18, Namic Pasha, a major-general of the Imperial Guard, set\r\nout for England with a letter from His Highness to King William IV.\r\npraying for naval assistance on the coast of Syria.[283]\r\n\r\nHad the decision rested with Palmerston alone it is possible that\r\naid of some kind might have been furnished to the Porte. But the\r\nmajority of the members of the Cabinet were strongly averse to\r\nembarking upon any fresh adventure, while the Belgian question was\r\nstill unsettled. Moreover, since the conclusion of the great war,\r\nthe naval establishments had been cut down to so low a point that it\r\nwould have been highly inconvenient to reinforce the Mediterranean\r\nsquadron. The British _chargé d'affaires_ at Constantinople was,\r\ntherefore, instructed to inform the Porte that \"naval assistance was\r\na matter of greater difficulty than at first sight it would appear\r\nto be.\" Nevertheless, the request was regarded as a striking proof\r\nof the Sultan's confidence in British friendship, and His Majesty's\r\ngovernment would at once convey to Mehemet Ali \"an expression of\r\nregret that he should so far have forgotten what was due to his\r\nSovereign.\"[284] This was all the comfort which Mandeville was able\r\nto give to the distracted Turkish ministers, at the moment when the\r\nnews reached Constantinople that the Grand Vizier had been completely\r\ndefeated at Konieh, that he himself was a prisoner in Ibrahim's hands\r\nand that, in the words of the _Reis-Effendi_, \"the Turkish army\r\nexisted no longer.\"[285]\r\n\r\nA few days before the arrival of the news of the disaster at Konieh,\r\nthe Russian general, Muravieff, suddenly appeared at Constantinople.\r\nOn December 23 both he and Boutenieff, the Russian ambassador, had a\r\nconference with the _Reis-Effendi_ and the _Seraskier_, and, on the\r\n27th, the general was received in private audience by the Sultan,\r\nto whom he presented a letter from the Tsar. No mystery was made of\r\nthe fact that Muravieff had been charged to proceed to Cairo, to\r\nwarn Mehemet Ali that, should he persist in refusing to make his\r\nsubmission to the Sultan, he would bring down upon himself the wrath\r\nof the Emperor Nicholas. But both Mandeville and Varennes, the French\r\n_chargé d'affaires_, were soon satisfied, notwithstanding the secrecy\r\nwith which the Russian proceedings were surrounded, that an offer of\r\nmilitary assistance had been tendered to the Porte. Their information\r\nwas correct.[286] Boutenieff had offered to place a squadron of\r\nthe Black Sea fleet at the Sultan's disposal, but his Highness,\r\nwith profuse expressions of gratitude, had declined the proffered\r\nassistance. Rather than accept help from Russia, he was prepared\r\nto humble his pride and to send Halil Pasha to attempt to arrange\r\na settlement with his rebellious vassal. On January 5, 1833, this\r\ndecision was conveyed to Boutenieff, whereupon Muravieff at once set\r\nout upon his mission to Mehemet Ali, the Sultan's envoy, Halil Pasha,\r\nhaving already started upon his way to Alexandria.\r\n\r\nThere had, for a long time past, been a disposition in England\r\nto regard French relations with Egypt with suspicion. Ever since\r\nBonaparte's descent upon the country, Egypt was believed to have a\r\nsentimental attraction for the French. Now that by their acquisition\r\nof Algiers, they had gained a footing upon the African shore of\r\nthe Mediterranean, this feeling of distrust had increased. It was\r\nremembered that Polignac had seriously entertained the notion of\r\nsubsidizing Mehemet Ali and of employing a corps of Egyptian troops\r\nin the Algerian expedition. During the course of Ibrahim's campaign\r\nin Syria, both Stratford Canning and Mandeville had looked with sour\r\ndisapproval upon Varennes' efforts to persuade the Porte to allow\r\nFrance to mediate between the Sultan and the Pasha.[287] But both\r\nthe French and English governments were agreed as to the necessity\r\nof preserving the Ottoman Empire and were resolved to prevent, if\r\npossible, the Porte from falling completely under the influence of\r\nRussia. The Duc de Broglie, when he learnt that offers of assistance\r\nhad been made to the Sultan by Boutenieff, at once suggested the\r\njoint mediation of France and England in the Turco-Egyptian dispute,\r\nand was greatly disappointed to find that his proposal met with no\r\nresponse in London. Palmerston, for the present, was content to direct\r\nLord Ponsonby to proceed from Naples to Constantinople, as ambassador\r\nto the Porte, and to despatch Colonel Campbell to Egypt, in the\r\ncapacity of British agent and consul-general, with instructions to\r\ncommunicate \"freely and confidentially\" with the French and Austrian\r\nrepresentatives at Alexandria.[288]\r\n\r\nIt was one of the ironies of the situation that, at this time, when\r\nRussia was suspected of intending to put into execution long-matured\r\nschemes against the integrity of the Ottoman Empire, her traditional\r\npolicy towards Turkey had in fact been completely reversed. As far\r\nback as the year 1802 the minister, Kotchuby, taking as his text\r\nMontesquieu's doctrine that no Power can have a better neighbour\r\nthan a weak State, had drawn up a memorandum to prove that the\r\npreservation, not the destruction, of Turkey should be the object of\r\nRussian policy. More recently, in 1829, when the terms of the peace\r\nof Adrianople were under consideration, the members of the eastern\r\ncommittee had endorsed Kotchuby's views, and the Tsar Nicholas had\r\nreluctantly adopted their conclusions.[289] Muravieff's instructions\r\nhad been drawn strictly in this spirit. Mehemet Ali, Nesselrode laid\r\ndown, must not be allowed to reach Constantinople and to overthrow the\r\nexisting _régime_. Such a development would be opposed to the Imperial\r\npolicy, which aimed at maintaining Turkey in her present \"stationary\r\ncondition.\" Should the Pasha succeed in establishing himself at\r\nConstantinople, Russia would be placed \"in contact with a strong and\r\nvictorious Power instead of a weak and defeated neighbour.\"[290]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Ibrahim who was still at Konieh was believed to be on\r\nthe point of moving forward to Brusa.[291] Both to Colonel Duhamel,\r\nMuravieff's aide-de-camp, and to a messenger despatched to him by M.\r\nde Varennes, he returned the same answer. He was a soldier and must\r\nobey his orders, his father alone could decide upon his movements. He\r\nshould be sorry to displease the Emperor Nicholas, but he must abide\r\nby his instructions.[292] Ibrahim's uncompromising attitude overcame\r\nthe Sultan's hesitation. Boutenieff was informed that the promised\r\nnaval assistance would be thankfully accepted and that, in addition,\r\nHis Highness craved for the despatch of 30,000 Russian troops for\r\nthe defence of his capital. The Sultan knew well that to invoke the\r\nmilitary protection of the Tsar must lower him in the eyes of his\r\nsubjects and of every true Mussulman. But, upon the whole, he regarded\r\nit as less dangerous than to allow Ibrahim to advance to the shores of\r\nthe Bosphorus. It was in vain, therefore, that Varennes and Mandeville\r\nexerted themselves to induce the Porte to withdraw the demand for\r\nRussian help.[293] \"A drowning man,\" said the _Reis-Effendi_, \"will\r\nclutch at a serpent.\"[294]\r\n\r\nEarly in February Muravieff was back at Constantinople. The terms\r\nwhich Halil Pasha had been empowered to offer had not been accepted,\r\nbut Mehemet Ali had promised Muravieff that, for the present, the\r\nEgyptian army should not advance beyond Kiutayeh.[295] Upon the news\r\nthat no immediate forward movement on the part of Ibrahim was to be\r\napprehended, both the French and British ministers again endeavoured\r\nto persuade the Porte to ask that the despatch of the Russian succour\r\nmight be delayed. According to the _Reis-Effendi_ such a request was\r\nactually made to Boutenieff, who replied that he had no ship at his\r\ndisposal to send to Sevastopol, although a Russian brig of war was at\r\nthe time at anchor in front of the embassy.[296] On the other hand,\r\naccounts of these proceedings, derived from Russian sources, state\r\nthat the question of postponing the departure of the fleet was never\r\nseriously raised.[297] Be that as it may, on February 20, 1833, the\r\nRussian squadron, consisting of four sail of the line, three large\r\nfrigates, a corvette and a brig, entered the Bosphorus and anchored at\r\nBuyukdere.\r\n\r\nThree days earlier, on February 17, Admiral Roussin, the newly\r\nappointed French ambassador to the Sublime Porte, arrived at\r\nConstantinople. Upon the appearance of the Russian fleet he at once\r\ninstructed his _dragoman_ to warn the Porte that, unless the admiral\r\nin command were requested to depart within twenty-four hours, he\r\nshould consider his mission at an end. At the same time he tried\r\nto induce the British minister to make a similar representation.\r\nMandeville, however, could only reply that he had no authority \"to\r\nhold language of so high and energetic a character.\" Roussin appears\r\nto have seen very soon that he had acted with undue precipitation,\r\nand that his own withdrawal would not hasten by an hour the departure\r\nof the Russian ships. But his next step was scarcely more judicious.\r\nOn the 21st, he affixed his signature to a document guaranteeing that\r\nMehemet Ali would make peace with the Sultan, upon the terms proposed\r\nby Halil Pasha and which had already been rejected. In return the\r\nSublime Porte was to undertake to refuse \"foreign succour\" of any kind\r\nin the future.[298]\r\n\r\nIt was hoped to satisfy Mehemet Ali by conferring upon him the\r\ngovernment of the districts of Acre, Naplous, Jerusalem and Tripoli.\r\nHe, however, was resolved to extend his rule over the whole of Syria,\r\nand to acquire, in addition, the pashalic of Adana and the seaports\r\nof Selefkeh and Alaia. Adana possessed an especial value in his\r\neyes, by reason of its forests from which he proposed to obtain the\r\ntimber necessary for the building of his ships. He understood the\r\ndifficulties of the Sultan's position and he was well informed about\r\nthe rivalries of the Powers.[299] He perceived clearly that he was\r\nnever likely again to have so favourable an opportunity for pressing\r\nhis demands upon the Porte. On March 23, accordingly, Reshid Bey\r\narrived at Constantinople bringing a letter in which Mehemet Ali\r\nrejected scornfully Admiral Roussin's proposals. He would rather, he\r\ndeclared, meet with an honourable death than submit to be deprived of\r\nterritories which were his by right of conquest. At the same time,\r\nIbrahim was directed to march on Constantinople if, within five days\r\nof Reshid's arrival, the Sultan should not have agreed to the required\r\nconcessions.[300]\r\n\r\nTerrible consternation prevailed in the _Seraglio_, and great\r\nwas the perplexity at the French and British embassies. Roussin\r\ncounselled a complete surrender to Mehemet Ali, and Mandeville had\r\nno alternative to propose. It was decided, finally, that a Turkish\r\nplenipotentiary should proceed, accompanied by M. de Varennes, to\r\nIbrahim's headquarters at Kiutayeh with authority to offer the\r\npashalics of Damascus and Aleppo.[301] Ibrahim, however, would not\r\nentertain the idea of a compromise, and Varennes could only report the\r\nfailure of his mission and advise the cession of Adana. In opposition\r\nto the recommendations of Mandeville, but with the approbation of\r\nAdmiral Roussin, the Sultan consented to yield up to his vassal this\r\nvaluable district.[302] The preliminaries of this agreement, known as\r\nthe Convention of Kiutayeh were signed on April 8, 1833, and Ibrahim\r\nforthwith began his preparations for retiring into Syria.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, however, on April 6, a second division of the\r\nRussian fleet had arrived in the Bosphorus and 5000 troops had been\r\ndisembarked on the Asiatic shore opposite to the British embassy\r\nat Therapia. The Tsar Nicholas was greatly incensed at Admiral\r\nRoussin's attempts to induce the Porte to ask for the withdrawal of\r\nhis squadron. Pozzo di Borgo was, in consequence, charged to protest\r\nvigorously in Paris against the admiral's conduct, and the complaints\r\nof the Russian ambassador were warmly supported by his colleagues of\r\nAustria and Prussia. Broglie, although he might allow Lord Granville\r\nto perceive that he was not altogether convinced of the wisdom of\r\nRoussin's actions, invariably met the representations of the agents\r\nof the Northern Courts with the reply that the admiral's conduct\r\nwas fully approved of by his government.[303] At Constantinople\r\nBoutenieff declared emphatically that nothing short of the complete\r\nevacuation of Asia Minor by the Egyptians would induce his Imperial\r\nmaster to recall either his fleet or his troops to Sevastopol.[304]\r\n\r\nWhen the list of the pashalics to which Mehemet Ali had been appointed\r\nwas officially made public, it was seen that no mention had been\r\nmade of the province of Adana. Upon hearing of this breach of the\r\nConvention of Kiutayeh, Ibrahim promptly arrested the homeward\r\nmarch of his army.[305] A few days later, however, on April 22,\r\na third division of the Russian fleet and a second detachment of\r\ntroops entered the Bosphorus. These reinforcements, which should\r\nhave added to the Sultan's powers of resistance, became, in effect,\r\nthe determining cause of his decision finally to give way about\r\nAdana. Ever since the entry of Ibrahim into Asia Minor, the people\r\nof Constantinople had been deprived of their usual sources of\r\nsupply. The necessity of provisioning the Russian fleet and _corps\r\nd'armée_ had greatly aggravated the difficulties of the situation.\r\nConfronted by the prospect of a famine and a rising of the populace,\r\nMahmud elected to humble his pride and to obtain the withdrawal of\r\nthe Egyptians at the price of the surrender of Adana.[306] Yet he\r\ncould not bring himself openly to nominate his rebellious vassal\r\nto the governorship of this important province. Ibrahim was, in\r\nconsequence, officially appointed collector of the crown revenues of\r\nthe district. Mehemet Ali, provided he could exercise an effective\r\ndominion over Adana, was content, in this instance, to waive his\r\nclaim to be styled its Pasha. In point of fact he was delighted that\r\nmatters had been so satisfactorily arranged. Under Campbell's threat\r\nthat, should he persist in claiming Adana, the coast of Egypt would\r\nbe blockaded by the British fleet, he had actually announced his\r\nintention of withdrawing his demand, when the news arrived that the\r\nSultan had invested his son with the administration of the territory\r\nin dispute.[307] Relations of amity were thus once more officially\r\nestablished between the Sublime Porte and the Pasha.\r\n\r\nOn May 1 Lord Ponsonby, the newly appointed British ambassador,\r\narrived at Constantinople, preceding by three days Count Orloff, the\r\n_generalissimo_ of the Russian military and naval forces in the Black\r\nSea and the Bosphorus, and Ambassador-Extraordinary to the Sublime\r\nPorte. His appointment was due to the Tsar's desire to be represented\r\nat Constantinople by some one who could be depended upon resolutely to\r\noppose Admiral Roussin. Boutenieff appears to have been considered as\r\nsomewhat deficient both in energy and strength of character. Orloff\r\nhad been furnished with very wide powers, but he was charged to regard\r\nthe task of convincing the Sultan and his ministers that their safety\r\nentirely depended upon the degree of support which, in the future, the\r\nTsar might be disposed to afford them, as the primary object of his\r\nmission. He must be admitted to have carried out his instructions most\r\nfaithfully. From the day of his arrival Russian influence was supreme\r\nat the Porte and in the Divan. Roussin's request that French war ships\r\nshould be allowed to pass through the Dardanelles was peremptorily\r\nrefused. Ponsonby saw clearly that, for the time being, he must submit\r\nto be overshadowed completely by the Russian ambassador. For the\r\npresent he could only gaze moodily from his windows at the Russian\r\nencampment in the valley of Unkiar-Skelessi and endeavour to restrain\r\nhis French colleague from affording Orloff any excuse for delaying\r\nthe departure of his troops. At last, on July 9 and 10, the Egyptian\r\nwithdrawal behind the Taurus mountains having been completely carried\r\nout, the Tsar's soldiers were embarked and his ships sailed out of the\r\nBosphorus.[308]\r\n\r\nFor some weeks prior to the departure of the Russian expedition,\r\nit had been reported that an offensive and defensive treaty was on\r\nthe point of being concluded between the Tsar and the Sultan.[309]\r\nThe truth of this rumour was confirmed after Orloff had quitted\r\nConstantinople. It would appear that it was the Sultan himself who\r\nfirst suggested an alliance, at an audience accorded to Orloff shortly\r\nafter his arrival, and that Ahmed Pasha acted as the intermediary\r\nbetween the palace and the Russian embassy in the very secret\r\nnegotiations which followed. The diplomatic instrument, known as the\r\nTreaty of Unkiar-Skelessi, concluded between the Porte and Russia on\r\nJuly 8, 1833, for a duration of eight years, consisted of six public\r\nand one secret article. The public articles merely proclaimed the\r\nexistence of peace and friendship between the two Empires and provided\r\nfor their mutual succour in case of need. The whole importance of\r\nthe treaty lay in the secret clause in which it was stipulated that,\r\ninasmuch as Russia had no intention of exercising her right to ask\r\nfor military assistance, the Porte, in return, would, \"upon demand\r\nand in accordance with the principle of reciprocity,\"[310] close the\r\nDardanelles to the warships of all nations.\r\n\r\nIt appears that, when it became necessary to inform the Turkish\r\nministers of the projected treaty, they one and all evinced the\r\ngreatest repugnance to the idea of an alliance with their hereditary\r\nenemies. But, at the news that the British fleet was approaching the\r\nDardanelles, they withdrew their objections. They had besought the\r\nBritish government for naval assistance in the struggle with Mehemet\r\nAli, and their request had been refused. The arrival, on June 25, in\r\nthe Bay of Tenedos of Sir Pulteney Malcolm's squadron, which, a few\r\nmonths earlier, could have intercepted the communications with Egypt\r\nand changed the course of the campaign, now only served to revive\r\npainful recollections of Admiral Duckworth's proceedings in 1807.[311]\r\n\r\nThe question of access to the sea, which bathes the coasts of the\r\nrichest provinces of the Empire, must necessarily be a matter of the\r\nhighest importance to Russia. The principle of regarding the Black\r\nSea as a _mare clausum_ found a place in the treaty concluded between\r\nthe Porte and Russia, on December 23, 1798. It was again inserted\r\ninto the treaty of September 23, 1805, but with this important\r\naddition--that to the Russian fleet was granted a right of passage to\r\nthe Mediterranean through the straits. These conditions, however, had\r\nbeen terminated by the outbreak of hostilities in 1806, and in the\r\nsubsequent treaty of peace, signed at Bucharest on May 10, 1812, no\r\nmention was made of the special privilege which Russia had obtained\r\nseven years before. Again in the treaty of peace concluded between\r\nGreat Britain and Turkey, on January 5, 1809, England undertook to\r\nobserve \"the ancient rule of the Ottoman Empire,\" which declared\r\nthe straits of Constantinople closed to the warships of the Powers.\r\nBut this arrangement, which had ever since been regarded as a law of\r\nnations, was suddenly terminated by the act, signed at the palace of\r\nUnkiar-Skelessi, restoring Russia to the favoured position which she\r\nhad enjoyed for a brief space of time in 1805. No specific mention,\r\nit was true, had been made of her right of passage to and from the\r\nBlack Sea to the Mediterranean. Nevertheless, although for obvious\r\nreasons both Russian and Turkish ministers might prefer to elude a\r\ndirect statement on the subject, they unquestionably placed this\r\ninterpretation upon Orloff's treaty.[312] It was in this light also\r\nthat it was looked upon by Lord Palmerston and the Duc de Broglie.\r\n\r\nAt the suggestion of Broglie,[313] as it would appear, the French\r\nand English governments resolved to instruct their representatives\r\nat Constantinople to advise the Porte not to ratify the treaty. But,\r\nshould the Sultan confirm the signatures of his plenipotentiaries,\r\nthey were to hand in a note, pointing out that by the treaty the\r\nrelations of Turkey with Russia seemed to have been placed upon an\r\nentirely new footing. In the event of this changed situation leading\r\nto the armed interference of Russia in the internal affairs of Turkey,\r\nFrance and Great Britain were resolved to act as the circumstances\r\nmight appear to require, \"equally as if the treaty above mentioned\r\nwere not in existence.\"[314] Directly it had been reported that this\r\nnote had been presented to the Porte, a copy of it was transmitted to\r\nthe French and British ministers at St. Petersburg, for communication\r\nto the Imperial Cabinet. Nesselrode in reply contended that the treaty\r\nwas purely defensive and aimed solely at the preservation of Turkey.\r\nIt had, it was true, changed the relations of the two Empires towards\r\neach other. It had converted a state of hostility and suspicion\r\ninto one of friendship and confidence. His Majesty the Emperor was\r\ndetermined, should circumstances demand it, faithfully to carry out\r\nthe obligations which he had contracted, \"as though the declaration\r\ncontained in the French and British notes did not exist.\"[315] In\r\nreturn Lord Palmerston reiterated the dissatisfaction with which the\r\ntreaty of Unkiar-Skelessi was regarded in England. This despatch was\r\nin due course communicated to Count Nesselrode by Mr. Bligh, the\r\nBritish _chargé d'affaires_, who, as he placed it in the hands of the\r\nRussian chancellor, added that his government \"was resolved not to\r\nbe drawn into a controversy upon a question in which it differed so\r\nwidely from the Imperial Cabinet.\"[316]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, a meeting had taken place, in September, at\r\nMünchengrätz, between the Tsar of Russia, the Emperor of Austria\r\nand the Crown Prince of Prussia. The object of this interview\r\nhad been officially ascribed solely to a desire upon the part of\r\nNicholas to become better acquainted with the Emperor Francis.[317]\r\nThis explanation, which was received with contemptuous derision by\r\nPalmerston,[318] and which Bligh \"could scarcely read with becoming\r\ngravity,\" deceived nobody. In point of fact weighty political matters\r\nwere the subject of the deliberations of these potentates and their\r\nconfidential advisers. The formation of a league of the three Northern\r\nCourts to resist the doctrine of non-intervention had, ever since\r\nthe Revolution of July, been the favourite scheme of Nicholas and\r\nMetternich. Frederick William III., however, was doubtful of the\r\nwisdom of openly resuscitating the Holy Alliance. He was strongly\r\nimpressed with the dangers of a policy, which must necessarily draw\r\na sharp dividing line between the absolute and the constitutional\r\nPowers. For this reason neither the King of Prussia nor his chief\r\nminister travelled to the little town on the Bohemian frontier to\r\nassist at the deliberations. But, after the two Emperors had set out\r\non their return to their respective capitals, Nesselrode journeyed\r\nto Berlin and succeeded in inducing the King of Prussia to become a\r\nparty to the convention to which Nicholas and Francis had given their\r\nadherence. By this treaty, signed at Berlin, on October 15, 1833,\r\nthe right of every independent sovereign to call to his aid another\r\nsovereign was proclaimed. Should one of the three Courts see fit to\r\nrender material assistance to any sovereign, and should such action\r\nbe opposed by another Power, the three Courts would consider any\r\ninterference of this kind in the light of an act of hostility directed\r\nagainst them all.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the objections of the King of Prussia, the plan of\r\ntransmitting this convention to the French government was abandoned.\r\nBut the principle, which it involved, formed the subject of separate\r\ndespatches, couched in more or less threatening language, which the\r\nagents of the three Northern Courts in Paris duly communicated to\r\nthe Duc de Broglie. The Duke, however, declared emphatically that,\r\nwhatever her attitude might be as regards more distant States,\r\nFrance would assuredly resist by force of arms any intervention in\r\nSwitzerland, Belgium or Piedmont. Moreover, he caused a circular to be\r\nsent to all French representatives at foreign Courts clearly defining\r\nthe line of action which would be adopted in cases of intervention.\r\nThe boldness of his language came as a disagreeable surprise to\r\nMetternich. The Northern Courts, when they made their communications\r\nto the French government, had not intended to provoke a defiant\r\nrejoinder of this kind.\r\n\r\nAt their meeting at Münchengrätz, however, the two Emperors had not\r\nbeen concerned exclusively with the question of intervention, and with\r\ntheir policy towards France. On September 18, 1833, Nesselrode and\r\nMetternich signed a convention, pledging Russia and Austria to combine\r\nfor the preservation of the Ottoman empire. The contracting parties\r\nspecifically undertook to oppose any extension of the authority of\r\nMehemet Ali over the European provinces of Turkey. Lastly, should the\r\nexisting _régime_ at Constantinople be overturned, Russia and Austria\r\nagreed to act in concert on every point relating to the establishment\r\nof a new order of affairs.[319]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Nicholas saw fit to insist that absolute secrecy\r\nshould be observed with regard to this convention, which might, with\r\nso much advantage, have been communicated to the western Powers. He\r\nprobably feared that Russia's changed policy towards Turkey would be\r\nascribed to alarm, engendered by Admiral Roussin's hostile attitude\r\nat Constantinople. Sincerely desirous as he was to conciliate the\r\nEnglish government, he would not consent to admit, so long as France\r\nand Great Britain were intimately united, that Russia had renounced\r\nher old ambition of establishing her power upon the Bosphorus.\r\nBut, although his pride would not allow him frankly to explain his\r\neastern policy to the British government, he was at pains to convince\r\nMr. Bligh of the purity of his intentions. He was a \"_chevalier\r\nanglais_,\" he reminded him at the conclusion of a long talk about the\r\nTreaty of Unkiar-Skelessi, and, pointing to his star of the Garter,\r\ntwice repeated the words \"_Honi soit_ _qui mal y pense_.\"[320] But\r\nassurances of this kind carried no weight with the English government.\r\nRussia was universally believed to be moving steadily towards\r\nConstantinople. The chief organs of the press accused her daily of\r\nsecretly preparing to conquer or to absorb the Ottoman empire. The\r\nmost extreme Radicals in the reformed Parliament, and Tory gentlemen,\r\nthe hunting friends of Matuszewic,[321] at Melton, were alike\r\nconvinced of the duplicity and of the aggressive character of Russian\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nIt was necessarily a matter of the deepest interest to both Palmerston\r\nand Broglie to ascertain the spirit in which Metternich would\r\nregard the Treaty of Unkiar-Skelessi. The despatches from Vienna,\r\nhowever, speedily dispelled the hope that the dominant position\r\nwhich Russia had acquired at Constantinople would meet with the\r\ndisapproval of Austria. Metternich's lips were sealed on the subject\r\nof the Austro-Russian convention respecting Turkey, and he could,\r\nin consequence, only declare emphatically that he felt no distrust\r\nof Russia, and was satisfied that she harboured no hostile designs\r\nagainst Turkey. If England, he reminded Lamb,[322] had not refused\r\nthe Sultan the assistance for which he had asked, he would not have\r\nbeen driven to look to Russia as his sole protector against Mehemet\r\nAli. Neither Palmerston nor Broglie believed that these expressions of\r\nconfidence in the honest intentions of Russia represented Metternich's\r\nreal convictions. Both attributed his attitude to his intense fear\r\nof revolution, which made him wilfully blind to the schemes which\r\nRussia was maturing so craftily. But, so long as he should continue\r\nin this frame of mind, they were agreed that it would be \"imprudent\r\nfor Great Britain and France to found upon the treaty any measures\r\nof decided hostility.\"[323] For the present, therefore, they were\r\ncontent to exercise the greatest vigilance, and to be prepared for\r\nfresh developments. Every endeavour, however, was to be made to open\r\nthe eyes of the Sultan to the real nature of his position, and to\r\ninduce him to withdraw from the fatal alliance into which he had been\r\ninveigled. At the same time it was greatly to be desired that Russia\r\nshould be afforded no excuse for intervening under the stipulations\r\nof Orloff's treaty. A fresh quarrel between the Porte and Mehemet Ali\r\nwas the only circumstance which could possibly justify such action\r\non her part. The whole influence of Great Britain and France must,\r\naccordingly, be exerted to prevent the Pasha from committing any\r\nrenewed act of aggression.[324]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                    TWO QUEENS AND TWO PRETENDERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe growing power of Mehemet Ali, and the increasing decrepitude of\r\nthe Ottoman Empire were not the only subjects which, in the year 1833,\r\nengaged the serious attention of the European Cabinets. A civil war\r\nwas in progress in Portugal, and Spain was threatened with the same\r\ncalamity. Dom Pedro, the Emperor of Brazil, had, on the death of his\r\nfather, abdicated the crown of Portugal in favour of his seven year\r\nold daughter, Donna Maria de Gloria. At the same time he had appointed\r\nhis brother, Dom Miguel, to the Regency, on the understanding that he\r\nwould agree to observe the Charter, and to marry his niece, the young\r\nQueen. Dom Miguel gave the required assurances, but upon his arrival\r\nat Lisbon, early in the year 1828, he proceeded to abrogate the\r\nconstitution, and shortly afterwards to usurp the throne. His unlawful\r\nassumption of the crown was followed by harsh and reactionary measures\r\nagainst Liberals and Freemasons, which culminated in the establishment\r\nof a veritable reign of terror. It was in consequence of this state\r\nof affairs, that, in July, 1831, a French fleet had, with the full\r\napproval of the British government, been dispatched to the Tagus to\r\nexact reparation for outrages committed on French subjects.[325]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, a successful revolution in Brazil had compelled Dom Pedro\r\nto seek refuge in England, where he arrived with his daughter at\r\nthe very moment when Admiral Roussin's squadron was before Lisbon.\r\nThe fallen Emperor threw himself heart and soul into the task of\r\nreconquering his daughter's kingdom. Lord Grey's Cabinet regarded his\r\nwarlike preparations with tacit approval, whilst the French government\r\nopenly encouraged him, and allowed his followers to assemble at\r\nBelle-Isle. The constitutional fleet, commanded by Sartorius, a\r\nBritish naval officer, set sail from that port on February 10, 1832,\r\nand, by the following month of July, Dom Pedro was master of Oporto.\r\nBut, though he constantly succeeded in defeating the Miguelite forces\r\nsent to re-take the city, his cause made little or no progress in\r\nother parts of the country.\r\n\r\nWhilst these events were taking place in Portugal the health of the\r\nKing of Spain had been visibly declining. Under ordinary circumstances\r\nit would have been a matter for congratulation, rather than for\r\nregret, that any country should be relieved from the rule of such a\r\nman as Ferdinand VII. In this particular instance, however, it was\r\ntoo probable that a fiercely disputed succession would be the legacy\r\nwhich he would bequeath to his unfortunate subjects. His third wife,\r\nMaria Amalia of Saxony, had died on May 17, 1829, and he, thereupon,\r\nannounced his intention of re-marrying. His choice fell upon an\r\nintelligent and attractive woman in the person of his niece, Maria\r\nChristina of Naples. His first three marriages had been childless, but\r\nhis fourth wife, Christina, presented him with a daughter on October\r\n10, 1830. By the ancient law of Spain females could succeed to the\r\nthrone, in the event of there being no direct male heirs. But in 1713,\r\nPhilip V., in order to prevent the union of the Spanish and French\r\ncrowns, had been forced to issue a Pragmatic Sanction, which gave the\r\npreference of succession always to the male line. This act, however,\r\nwas repealed in 1789 by Charles IV., who restored the ancient law.\r\n\r\nThis return to the old order of succession was not, however, made\r\npublic until May 19, 1830, when Christina succeeded in persuading\r\nFerdinand to allow the decree of Charles IV. to be promulgated.\r\nConsequently, when some five months later her daughter was born,\r\nshe was promptly proclaimed Princess of the Asturias, a title only\r\nconferred upon an heiress to the throne. A fierce struggle then began\r\nbetween Christina and Don Carlos, who had hitherto been looked upon\r\nas his brother's successor. This prince was the champion of the ultra\r\nclerical--the so-called _Apostolical_ party--whereas Christina, who,\r\nduring her passage through France, had promised to use her influence\r\non behalf of the Spanish political exiles, represented the hopes of\r\nthe Liberals. Thus, in September, 1832, when Ferdinand was supposed\r\nto be at the point of death, the _Apostolical_ minister, Calomarde,\r\nsucceeded in procuring the abrogation of the law of 1789. But the King\r\nmost unexpectedly recovered, and, under the influence of Christina,\r\ncaused the decree of Charles IV. to be promulgated a second time.\r\nCalomarde, moreover, was disgraced and dismissed and a comparatively\r\nLiberal Cabinet was formed.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment of Dom Pedro's return to Europe, the French Cabinet\r\nhad endeavoured to persuade the British government to join with\r\nFrance in expelling Dom Miguel from Portugal. Palmerston, however,\r\nhad declined to interfere actively.[326] He was very unwilling that\r\nFrance should be afforded an opportunity of extending her influence\r\nin Portugal, and he, moreover, suspected Louis Philippe of scheming\r\nto marry one of his sons to Donna Maria. But, provided it could be\r\nbrought about without a French intervention, he was sincerely anxious\r\nthat the usurper should be overthrown and that a Liberal _régime_\r\nshould be set up at Lisbon. The dismissal of Calomarde appears to have\r\nsuggested to him that the King of Spain might not be found unwilling\r\nto render assistance to the constitutional cause in Portugal. Under\r\nordinary circumstances Ferdinand could scarcely have been expected to\r\nregard with a friendly eye the establishment of a limited monarchy\r\nin a country bordering upon Spain. But the birth of his daughter\r\nhad introduced a new element into the situation. Dom Miguel derived\r\nhis strength from the support of the _Apostolical_ party, which\r\nin Spain looked upon Don Carlos as its champion. There were some\r\ngrounds, therefore, for hoping that Ferdinand's paternal anxiety to\r\nsee his daughter Isabella's succession to the throne assured might\r\nprove stronger than his natural aversion to the growth of Liberal\r\ninstitutions in a neighbouring State.\r\n\r\nThe task of inducing Ferdinand to intervene on behalf of Donna Maria\r\nwas entrusted to Sir Stratford Canning, who was generally selected\r\nfor the most difficult negotiations. Canning arrived in Madrid, upon\r\nhis special mission, at the beginning of January, 1833. His first\r\nconferences with the Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs convinced\r\nhim that he had little prospect of bringing his task to a successful\r\nconclusion. Compared to a man of the type of Calomarde, Cea Bermúdez,\r\nhis successor, might seem to be a Liberal. In point of fact, however,\r\nalthough he was strongly opposed to Don Carlos and the clerical party,\r\nhe was even more hostile to representative institutions in any shape.\r\nAn enlightened despotism, in his opinion, constituted the best form\r\nof government for Spain. Accordingly, he made it very clear that the\r\nchange of ministry had in no way modified the views of the Court as\r\nto the situation in Portugal. It would be, he declared, altogether\r\ninconsistent with honour and good faith for the King to participate in\r\nany measures directed against the sovereignty of Dom Miguel.[327]\r\n\r\nStratford Canning, notwithstanding that his task seemed almost\r\nhopeless, remained some four months in the Spanish capital. So long\r\nas Cea Bermúdez was in power it was plainly useless to expect that\r\nFerdinand could be induced to enter into the views of the British\r\ngovernment. Canning, accordingly, set himself to work to undermine\r\nthe position of that minister. For a brief moment he seems to have\r\nbeen sanguine that, by means of \"a difference of opinion in the\r\nCabinet,\" he might be able to effect his purpose. But his hopes were\r\nspeedily dispelled. The three ministers opposed to Cea Bermúdez with\r\nwhom he had established communication were suddenly dismissed by the\r\nKing.[328] Nor was he more fortunate with Queen Christina, with whom\r\nhe contrived \"to open a direct and confidential intercourse.\"[329]\r\nShe appeared to agree with him that the triumph of Dom Miguel in\r\nPortugal could not fail to react disastrously upon the fortunes of her\r\ndaughter, but she either could not, or would not influence the King to\r\nregard matters in the same light.\r\n\r\nSir Stratford's difficulties had been aggravated by the news that Dom\r\nPedro's resources were exhausted, and that his position at Oporto was\r\ndesperate. But a few weeks after Canning's departure from Madrid the\r\nsituation in Portugal assumed a very different complexion. Sartorius,\r\nthe admiral of the constitutional fleet, had been replaced by Charles\r\nNapier, who from the first appears to have judged the political and\r\nstrategical situation correctly. The mere possession of Oporto and\r\nvictorious sallies against the Miguelite lines would never, he saw\r\nclearly, win the crown for Donna Maria. A bold move on Lisbon itself\r\ncould alone give the victory to the constitutionalists. The capital,\r\nin his opinion, might be captured, provided he could obtain the\r\ncommand of the sea. Having succeeded in persuading Dom Pedro and his\r\nadvisers to adopt his views, he sought out the Miguelite fleet, and,\r\non July 5, 1833, despite the inferiority of his ships, completely\r\ndestroyed it off Cape St. Vincent.[330] Three weeks later, Lisbon was\r\noccupied by Terceira, the constitutional general, in the name of Donna\r\nMaria.\r\n\r\nThe capture of Lisbon compelled the Miguelites to raise the siege of\r\nOporto. The civil war continued, nevertheless, in other parts of the\r\ncountry. No sooner, however, was Dom Pedro, the Regent, installed in\r\nthe capital than the British government recognized the sovereignty\r\nof Queen Maria, and undertook to protect her from aggression on the\r\npart of the King of Spain.[331] But the fear that Ferdinand might\r\nsend military assistance to Dom Miguel was speedily set at rest. On\r\nSeptember 29, 1833, he died, and Christina, thereupon, assumed the\r\ngovernment in the name of her daughter Isabella, who was at once\r\nacknowledged as Queen of Spain by France and Great Britain. The\r\npartisans of her uncle Don Carlos were, however, upon the alert. The\r\nBasque provinces rose in arms to the cry of \"Long live Carlos V. Long\r\nlive the Inquisition,\" and Don Carlos was proclaimed King, on October\r\n7, at Vittoria.[332]\r\n\r\nDon Carlos himself was fortunately absent from Madrid at the time of\r\nhis brother's death. Some few months earlier he had been practically\r\nexiled from Spain and had joined Dom Miguel in Portugal. The presence\r\nof the Spanish Pretender at the headquarters of the Portuguese Usurper\r\nappears at last to have brought home to Christina and her minister,\r\nCea Bermúdez, that the fortunes of Isabella must largely depend upon\r\nthe success of the constitutional cause in Portugal. Mr. Villiers, the\r\nBritish minister newly accredited to the Court of Madrid, experienced,\r\nin consequence, none of those difficulties which had baffled Stratford\r\nCanning's ingenuity, whilst Ferdinand was alive. The Queen Regent's\r\ngovernment consented, after some little hesitation, to propose to the\r\ncontending parties in Portugal the joint mediation of Great Britain\r\nand Spain, and, when Dom Miguel declined to consider this offer,\r\nCea Bermúdez announced that his refusal had released Spain from all\r\nengagements which she had contracted towards him.[333]\r\n\r\nAt the news that Ferdinand was dead and that serious disturbances had\r\nbroken out, the French government proceeded to concentrate troops in\r\nproximity to the Spanish frontier. These military movements excited\r\nconsiderable alarm in London, where it was feared that they were a\r\nprelude to an active intervention. Palmerston, however, was soon\r\nsatisfied that neither Louis Philippe nor the chief members of his\r\ngovernment wished to despatch an army across the Pyrenees.[334] In\r\nthe opinion of Duc de Broglie, the expulsion of Dom Miguel from\r\nPortugal was a necessary preliminary to any attempt to settle Spanish\r\naffairs. Both he and his colleagues, he declared, were prepared to\r\nrespect England's traditional dislike to any foreign intrusion in\r\nPortugal. But, under these circumstances, they had a right to expect,\r\nhe contended, that great Britain should herself take the necessary\r\nmeasures for terminating a situation, which threatened to disturb the\r\ntranquillity of neighbouring States.[335]\r\n\r\nAlthough very anxious to see peace restored, the British government\r\nwished to escape from the necessity of landing a military force\r\nin Portugal. It hoped to attain the desired result by concerting\r\nmeasures with Spain for the expulsion of both Pretenders. Seeing that\r\nDon Carlos was levying war from Portuguese territory against the\r\ngovernment of the Queen Regent, the right of Spain to intervene was\r\nbeyond question. In January, 1834, Cea Bermúdez had been succeeded by\r\nMartinez de la Rosa. The new minister entered readily into the plans\r\nof the British government and agreed to despatch an ambassador to\r\nLondon, provided with full powers to conclude a convention. Strict\r\nsecrecy was observed about the negotiations, and it was only, on April\r\n13, 1834, when all the details had been settled, that Palmerston\r\nshowed Talleyrand a draft of the proposed treaty. Spain was to send an\r\narmy against Dom Miguel, whilst England was to furnish Dom Pedro with\r\nnaval assistance. It was not intended to invite France to be a party\r\nto this agreement; she would merely be asked to adhere to it.[336]\r\n\r\nTalleyrand's account of this transaction was sent to Admiral de Rigny,\r\nnot to the Duc de Broglie. The refusal of the Chamber to ratify his\r\nproposals for settling a long-standing dispute with the United States,\r\nrespecting the indemnity to be paid for the seizure of certain ships\r\nbetween the years 1806 and 1812, had driven the Duke to resign. The\r\nconditions of the projected treaty caused the greatest irritation in\r\nParis. \"The effect would be disastrous,\" wrote Rigny, \"were it to\r\nappear that France had entered into the agreement under the protection\r\nof England.\"[337] Talleyrand was, accordingly, directed to insist\r\nthat France should be made a party to the treaty. After a lengthy\r\nand, at times, a heated discussion, Palmerston gave way and, on April\r\n22, 1834, the instrument, known as the Quadruple Treaty, was signed\r\nby the representatives of Great Britain, France, Spain and Portugal.\r\nAn article had been inserted into it stipulating that, \"should the\r\nco-operation of France be deemed necessary by the High Contracting\r\nParties the King of the French would engage to do, in this respect,\r\nwhatever might be settled by common consent between himself and his\r\naugust allies.\"\r\n\r\nThe immediate object of the alliance was rapidly achieved. The\r\njunction of a Spanish army under General Rodil with the constitutional\r\nforces, operating in Tras-os-Montes, was followed, on May 16, by a\r\ndecisive victory over Dom Miguel at Asserceira. A week later both\r\nPretenders capitulated at Evora Monte. Dom Miguel agreed to accept\r\na small pension[338] and to retire to Italy, whilst Don Carlos, at\r\nhis own request, was conveyed to England on board H.M.S. _Donegal_.\r\nBut the elation of the allies at the rapid success which had crowned\r\ntheir operations was of brief duration. After a stay of little more\r\nthan a week in London Don Carlos departed secretly, and, contriving to\r\ncross France undetected, reached Spain, where he appeared at the head\r\nof his followers in Biscay on July 9. This new development, both the\r\nFrench and British governments agreed, must be met by an extension of\r\nthe scope of the Quadruple Treaty. Certain additional articles were,\r\naccordingly, formally annexed to it, on August 18, 1834. By the first\r\nof these, the King of the French undertook to hinder supplies and arms\r\nfrom reaching the Carlists from his southern provinces. By the second,\r\nHis Britannic Majesty pledged himself to furnish Her Most Catholic\r\nMajesty with arms and ammunition and, in case of need, to supply naval\r\nsuccour; whilst by the third, the Regent of Portugal promised to\r\nrender whatever military assistance it might be in his power to give.\r\n\r\nIn thus deciding to afford Queen Isabella material assistance,\r\nthe French and English governments appear to have been strangely\r\noblivious of their loudly proclaimed principle of \"abstention from\r\ninterference in the affairs of other States.\" It was, doubtless, the\r\ninconsistency of their conduct in this respect which elicited from\r\nTalleyrand his cynical definition of the word non-intervention as\r\n\"_un mot métaphysique et politique qui signifie à peu près la même\r\nchose qu' intervention_.\"[339] Both governments had, unquestionably,\r\nexcellent reasons for desiring to put an end to a state of civil war\r\nand anarchy, which interfered with English trade, and had a disturbing\r\neffect upon the internal condition of France. In addition, there was\r\nthe consideration, to which Palmerston attached much weight, that the\r\nQuadruple Treaty, by proclaiming the intimate union of the Liberal\r\nPowers, would counterbalance the league which the absolute Courts\r\nhad, in the previous autumn, concluded at Münchengrätz.[340] Martinez\r\nde la Rosa, Christina's chief minister, had been engaged in framing\r\na constitutional Charter and the _Estatuto Real_,--the result of his\r\nlabours--was about to be made public. Spain might, therefore, claim\r\nto be numbered among the Liberal Powers of Europe. But there would\r\nseem to have been another, and a more exclusively national reason,\r\nfor the support which the English government decided to extend to the\r\ncause of constitutionalism in Spain. For the past century Spain had\r\nconstantly followed the impulse of France and that state of affairs\r\nhad, on many occasions, proved detrimental to British interests.\r\n\"Foreign influence, however,\" wrote Lord Palmerston some years\r\nlater, \"can best be exerted over the Court of a despotic monarch and\r\nbecomes much weaker, if not entirely paralyzed, when it has to act\r\nupon the constitutional representatives of a free people. The British\r\ngovernment, therefore, perceived that, by assisting the Spanish people\r\nto establish a constitutional form of government, they were assisting\r\nto secure the political independence of Spain, and they had no doubt\r\nthat the maintenance of that independence would be conducive to\r\nimportant British interests.\"[341]\r\n\r\nOne of the chief reasons, therefore, which led England to enter into\r\nthe Quadruple Treaty was to destroy that influence which, for more\r\nthan a century, France had been striving to establish over the Spanish\r\ngovernment. Her statesmen had constantly laid it down as the first\r\nprinciple of their policy that her ascendency must be supreme at the\r\nCourt at Madrid. It was essential, they argued, that France should\r\nhave no fears of an attack from beyond the Pyrenees, should she be\r\nengaged in war with her powerful eastern neighbours. On that account\r\nthe Salic Law, the Duc de Broglie explained to Lord Granville, was\r\ndistinctly advantageous to France, inasmuch as it debarred females\r\nfrom succeeding to the Spanish throne. Now that it was abolished, he\r\npointed out, the French government had to contemplate the possibility\r\nthat an Austrian Archduke might some day aspire to the hand of the\r\nQueen of Spain.[342] Louis Philippe not only endorsed the views of\r\nhis minister in this matter, but frankly confessed to the British\r\nambassador that the triumph of absolutism, in the person of Don\r\nCarlos, would suit him infinitely better than the establishment of a\r\nLiberal monarchy at Madrid. In that case \"he was greatly afraid that\r\nthe Peninsula would become the resort of all the revolutionists and\r\nrepublicans in Europe.\"[343]\r\n\r\nThese being Louis Philippe's opinions, it seems strange that he\r\nshould not have attempted to dissuade his ministers from committing\r\nhim to the Quadruple Treaty. The adoption of such a course, however,\r\nwould have been very dangerous. The \"citizen King\" might in his heart\r\ngreatly prefer _les capuchons_ to _les bonnets rouges_,[344] but he\r\ndared not publicly proclaim these sentiments. Moreover, had France\r\nabandoned the English alliance she would not have been received into\r\nthe league of the absolute Courts. Louis Philippe, consequently, if he\r\nwished to avoid complete isolation, was compelled to appear to adopt\r\nthe British policy. But his secret leanings being what they were and\r\nPalmerston's object being what it was, it is not surprising that,\r\nfrom the moment of the conclusion of the Quadruple Treaty, symptoms\r\nof serious disagreement should have manifested themselves in the\r\nrelations of the two governments.\r\n\r\nBefore the close of the year 1834 the Carlists were masters of the\r\nwhole of Biscay and Navarre, with the exception of some of the larger\r\ntowns. It was not alone the influence of the priests and the monks\r\nwhich induced the people of these provinces to espouse the cause\r\nof the Pretender so enthusiastically. They knew well that, were a\r\nrepresentative form of government to be established throughout Spain,\r\nthe _Fueros_,[345] those special rights and privileges to which\r\nthey were devotedly attached, must either be abolished or greatly\r\ncurtailed. A leader arose in Zumalacárregui, who quickly proved\r\nhis superiority over the constitutional generals sent against him.\r\nHenceforward the struggle between the Carlists and the _Christinos_\r\nwas carried on with a barbarity unknown in Europe for centuries.\r\nNeither side gave nor expected quarter. After every engagement wounded\r\nand unwounded prisoners were ruthlessly massacred. Such was the\r\ncondition of affairs when a change of government took place in England.\r\n\r\nLord Grey had resigned, on July 9, 1834, on a question of Irish\r\npolicy and had been succeeded as Prime Minister by Lord Melbourne.\r\nSigns were plentiful that the Whigs were losing their popularity in\r\nthe country, and the King resolved to dismiss his ministers at the\r\nfirst opportunity. The death of Lord Spencer gave him the pretext\r\nfor which he was seeking. Althorp's removal to the Upper House, he\r\ntold Melbourne, had left the government so weakly represented in the\r\nCommons that he should call upon his ministers to resign. Sir Robert\r\nPeel, accordingly, undertook to form a new government, and Wellington\r\naccepted the post of Secretary for Foreign Affairs. The Duke had never\r\napproved of his predecessor's policy of intervening in the disputed\r\nsuccession to the Spanish throne. But, soon after he had taken up his\r\nduties at the Foreign Office, an opportunity arose of interposing\r\nin a manner more in accordance with his views. In the course of a\r\nconference with Mr. Villiers, Martinez de la Rosa had suggested that\r\nthe French and British governments should propose to both parties\r\nsome arrangement for the exchange of prisoners and, generally, for\r\nmitigating the horrors of the war. The opening of communications\r\nwith Don Carlos on these lines might with advantage be made to serve\r\na double purpose. The commissioners, selected to proceed to the\r\nheadquarters of the Pretender, might be instructed to impress upon\r\nhim the hopelessness of his position, and to explain to him that he\r\ncould obtain no assistance from the absolute Courts. An authoritative\r\nstatement to that effect would, in the opinion of Martinez de la Rosa,\r\nbe more useful than \"six victories by her Majesty's troops.\" It would\r\nfurnish Don Carlos with the excuse, for which he was believed to be\r\nseeking, for abandoning the struggle.[346]\r\n\r\nLord Eliot was, accordingly, dispatched to Spain. Ostensibly, his\r\nmission had no other object than the negotiation of some agreement for\r\nterminating the inhuman methods of warfare, which both parties had\r\nadopted. In reality, however, he carried with him secret instructions\r\nbased upon the suggestions of Martinez de la Rosa. Whilst in Paris he\r\nwas to communicate these to the Duc de Broglie, who was once more at\r\nthe head of the Foreign Office, in order that the French commissioner\r\nmight be furnished with identical instructions.[347] Hitherto, there\r\nhad been no great cause for complaint as to the manner in which France\r\nperformed the duties imposed upon her by the additional articles of\r\nthe Quadruple Treaty. It was, therefore, with the utmost confidence\r\nthat the request would be promptly complied with, that Wellington\r\nhad decided to invite the French government to appoint some person\r\nto repair with Eliot to the seat of war. But Lord Cowley, who, upon\r\nthe change of government, had succeeded Lord Granville as British\r\nambassador in Paris, speedily ascertained that the Duke's proposal\r\nwas regarded with much disfavour. Nor was he long in doubt as to\r\nthe quarter from which the opposition to it was inspired. Louis\r\nPhilippe himself assured him, on April 2, that he dared not allow\r\ncommunications to be opened with Don Carlos, except in response to\r\nan official invitation from the government of the Queen Regent.\r\nBut, although the Spanish ambassador shortly afterwards made the\r\ndesired request, the King still hesitated to comply with it. He was\r\ngreatly afraid, he told Lord Cowley, that Don Carlos would refuse to\r\nentertain the suggested proposals. Were the Pretender to take such\r\na course, popular indignation would be aroused in France, and the\r\ngovernment might be forced to march an army into Spain to enforce its\r\ndemands.[348]\r\n\r\nEliot, in the meanwhile, had proceeded, unattended by a French\r\ncolleague, to the headquarters of Don Carlos. He experienced little\r\ndifficulty in inducing both contending parties to conclude a\r\nconvention for the proper custody and exchange of prisoners of war.\r\nBut no success attended his efforts to carry out the secret and more\r\nimportant part of his mission. Don Carlos resolutely declared that he\r\nnever would abandon the struggle. Nor could Eliot flatter himself that\r\nany of his arguments had in the smallest degree shaken the Pretender's\r\ndetermination to assert his right to the crown. Having exhausted all\r\nhis powers of persuasion he set out on his return journey. As a\r\nresult of his visit to the theatre of war he brought back to England\r\nthe conviction that, without foreign assistance, the government of\r\nthe Queen Regent would never contrive to pacify Alava, Biscay and\r\nNavarre.[349] Some weeks before he arrived in London Sir Robert Peel's\r\nbrief administration had come to an end. Melbourne had been recalled\r\nand Palmerston was once more at the Foreign Office.\r\n\r\nUpon learning of the failure of Eliot's mission, the government of\r\nthe Queen Regent resolved to apply to France for military assistance\r\nagainst Don Carlos. Palmerston, who at this time regarded a French\r\nintervention as the worst of evils, lost no time in directing Villiers\r\nto protest. No more telling indictment of the whole policy of the\r\nQuadruple Treaty exists than the despatch which, on this occasion,\r\nPalmerston himself sent off to Madrid. The British minister was to\r\nrepresent that to appeal for foreign aid, before all the resources at\r\nthe disposal of the Queen Regent had been exhausted, \"would little\r\nredound to the honour of the Spanish government.\" A settlement, he\r\nwas to remind Queen Christina's advisers, brought about by French\r\nor British bayonets, \"could only be temporary and would never be\r\nacquiesced in as legitimate and final by the nation.\"[350] It was\r\nvery far, however, from Louis Philippe's desire to despatch troops to\r\nSpain in support of the constitutional throne of Isabella. But, as\r\nPalmerston was also strongly opposed to direct French intervention,\r\nthe King felt that he might with safety consult the British government\r\nabout the propriety of acceding to the Spanish demand. Palmerston, as\r\nhe had foreseen, had numerous objections to urge against the entry\r\nof a French army into Spain. The French ambassador at Madrid was,\r\naccordingly, instructed to inform Martinez de la Rosa that his appeal\r\ncould not be complied with.[351] But, whilst making it perfectly clear\r\nthat direct intervention was out of the question, M. de Rayneval was\r\nauthorized to suggest that the foreign legion at Algiers might be\r\ntransferred from the French to the Spanish service, and to promise\r\nthat facilities for enlisting soldiers in France would be granted to\r\nthe Spanish government.\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet of Madrid readily accepted this limited form of\r\nassistance. Help of the same description, but upon a more extended\r\nscale, was also furnished by Great Britain. The Foreign Enlistment\r\nAct was suspended and officers and men were encouraged to enter the\r\nservice of the Queen of Spain. In England, where the war in the\r\nPeninsula was remembered with pride, volunteers were easily obtained.\r\nIn France, for obvious reasons the appeals of the Spanish recruiting\r\nagents met with far less response. Nevertheless, before the autumn\r\nof 1835 some 4000 men, chiefly from Algiers, were transported\r\nto Spain, whilst rather more than double that number of British\r\nvolunteers, under the command of De Lacy Evans, the Radical member\r\nfor Westminster, were conveyed to the seat of war. Don Carlos,\r\nhowever, retaliated promptly. From his headquarters at Durango he\r\nissued a proclamation announcing that the Eliot Convention could\r\nnot be permitted to apply to foreigners. Any person not of Spanish\r\nnationality, caught in arms against him, would be shot. The moment\r\nthis decree was brought to the notice of the British government\r\nColonel Wylde, the officer attached to the headquarters of the Queen's\r\narmies, was directed to protest against it.[352] Wylde obtained access\r\nto Don Carlos and read out to him the declaration which Palmerston\r\nhad drawn up. But the threats contained in it had no effect upon\r\nthe Pretender, who replied that his proclamation was lawful, under\r\nthe circumstances, and that his officers had the strictest orders to\r\nconform to it.[353] The only reprisal to which the British government\r\ncould resort was to signify to its naval commanders that, in the event\r\nof Don Carlos applying for protection on board any of His Majesty's\r\nships, such protection was to be denied to him.[354]\r\n\r\nThe French government altogether declined to associate itself with\r\nGreat Britain in protesting against the Decree of Durango. Lord\r\nGranville, who upon the return of the Whigs to office had resumed his\r\npost in Paris, found Louis Philippe and his chief ministers, with the\r\nexception of the Duc de Broglie, strongly opposed to any step of that\r\nkind. France, they argued, was differently circumstanced to Great\r\nBritain, inasmuch as she was not a party to the Eliot Convention.\r\nMoreover, were she to use threatening language to Don Carlos and\r\nwere he to disregard her menaces, she would be driven to send troops\r\nacross the frontier, and both the French and English governments had\r\nagreed that direct intervention was highly inexpedient for the moment.\r\nIn vain Lord Granville protested that to remonstrate against the\r\nbarbarity of the decree was a duty which the government owed to the\r\nmen, who had been transferred from the French to the Spanish service.\r\nNeither that argument, nor the consideration that any appearance\r\nof lack of harmony between the French and British Cabinets must\r\nnecessarily encourage the Pretender, had the smallest effect upon\r\nLouis Philippe or upon the majority of his ministers.[355]\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston's indignation at Louis Philippe's conduct was\r\nincreased by the news which he was receiving from Lisbon. Dom Pedro\r\nhad died on September 24, 1834, and the Cortes had, thereupon,\r\ndeclared the Queen to be of age, although she was not yet sixteen\r\nyears of age. Shortly afterwards she had married Augustus of\r\nLeuchtenberg, the young duke whose candidature for the Belgian\r\nthrone had so alarmed Louis Philippe in 1830. Their married life,\r\nhowever, was of brief duration. On March 25, 1835, Maria became a\r\nwidow and the Cortes at once urged her to lose no time in contracting\r\na second alliance. The young queen was quite ready to comply and\r\nsoon, afterwards, informed her ministers, Marshal Saldanha and the\r\nDuke of Palmella, that she purposed marrying either the Duc de\r\nNemours or the Prince de Joinville, both sons of Louis Philippe. Her\r\nselection of the French princes, wrote Lord Howard de Walden,[356]\r\nwas to be ascribed to the influence of her aunt, the Marquise de\r\nLoulé, who was afterwards discovered to have been in the pay of Louis\r\nPhilippe.[357] The British minister, however, succeeded in obtaining\r\nfrom Saldanha a promise in writing that he would resign, sooner than\r\nallow the French marriage to take place.[358] In Paris, meanwhile,\r\nLouis Philippe emphatically denied to the British ambassador that\r\nhe had ever entertained the idea of bringing forward one of his sons\r\nas a candidate for the hand of the Queen of Portugal.[359] It seems\r\ncertain, nevertheless, that some intrigue with that purpose in view\r\nhad been in progress, and that it was not persevered with on account\r\nof the opposition of the British government. In the opinion of Lord\r\nHoward de Walden, it was to be attributed to the machinations of the\r\nFrench party at the Court of Lisbon that Queen Maria, about this\r\ntime, displayed the greatest reluctance to sanction the despatch of\r\na Portuguese division to the assistance of the _Christinos_.[360]\r\nBut before long it was announced that she was betrothed to Prince\r\nFerdinand of Saxe-Coburg, a nephew of the King of the Belgians. The\r\nmarriage was celebrated on April 9, 1836, and from that moment the\r\ninfluence of the French party at the Court diminished.\r\n\r\nBut the proceedings of the French agents at Lisbon and Louis\r\nPhilippe's sympathy for the Spanish Carlists were secrets, as yet\r\nknown only to certain ministers and diplomatists. It was otherwise\r\nwith the increasing rivalry between the British envoy and the French\r\nambassador accredited to the Court of the Queen Regent at Madrid.\r\nIt was the subject of comment in the newspapers that France openly\r\nfavoured the cause of one, whilst England no less ostentatiously\r\ngave her support to the other, of the two great political parties\r\nwhich Spanish constitutionalism had called into existence. Most of\r\nthe leading men in the Cortes had been in exile, until the death of\r\nFerdinand, on account of their participation in the revolutionary\r\nmovement of 1820. Some, like Martinez de la Rosa, had sought refuge\r\nin France, whilst others, prominent among them being the financier\r\nMendizabal, had repaired to England. Their political views had, in\r\nconsequence, been greatly influenced by the statesmen with whom they\r\nhad come into contact in the countries in which they had resided. Thus\r\nMartinez de la Rosa, whose literary abilities had brought him to the\r\nnotice of M. Guizot, had adopted the theories of the _Doctrinaires_\r\nand in framing the _Estatuto Real_--the Spanish Constitution of\r\n1834--he had taken the French Charter of 1814 for his model. His\r\nfollowers, the _Moderados_ as they were called, consisted mainly of\r\nthe nobility, military and civil officials, and, generally, of persons\r\nwho, although opposed to Don Carlos, disliked democratic institutions.\r\nTheir opponents, the _Exaltados_, or _Progressistas_, as they were\r\nmore usually termed, were made up chiefly of members of the trading\r\nand commercial classes in the large towns. The extreme wing of this\r\nparty advocated the restoration of the Constitution of 1812, which\r\nrecognized the sovereignty of the people and provided for government\r\nby a single chamber. It was this code which, in 1820, Riego and his\r\nfollowers had imposed upon King Ferdinand. But, although only the\r\nmore violent of the _Progressistas_ may have desired that the very\r\ndefective Constitution of 1812 should be re-established without\r\namendments, the whole party derided the _Estatuto Real_ as too timid\r\nan experiment in representative government.\r\n\r\nA party, which aimed at imposing salutary checks upon the development\r\nof democracy and the leaders of which were in close personal\r\nrelationship with some of his ministers, was naturally regarded with\r\na friendly eye by Louis Philippe. From 1834 onwards the _Moderados_\r\nderived an artificial strength, which to some extent counterbalanced\r\nthe numerical superiority of their opponents, by reason of the support\r\ngiven them by Louis Philippe and by Christina, the Queen Regent.\r\nIt was no less logical that the _Progressistas_ should develop\r\nrapidly into \"the English party.\" For reasons which have already\r\nbeen explained Palmerston desired that Spain should be free and\r\nindependent. But, before Don Carlos could be crushed and the civil\r\nwar terminated, the cause of the Queen must be made popular with the\r\nSpanish people. From Palmerston's point of view, therefore, it was\r\nessential that political power should rest with the party which sought\r\nto place the government upon a broad and national basis. Objectionable\r\nin many respects as were the principles of the _Progressistas_, they\r\nwere, in the opinion of the British government, unquestionably better\r\nadapted to the immediate requirements of the situation than the narrow\r\nand restricted views of the _Moderados_.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the democratic movement, which had begun at the death\r\nof Ferdinand, drove Martinez de la Rosa from office in June, 1835. But\r\nhis successor, Count Toreno, was not more successful in his efforts\r\nto stem the rising tide of Liberalism, and, in the following month\r\nof September, Christina reluctantly consented to allow Mendizabal to\r\nform a _Progressista_ Cabinet. Louis Philippe and his ministers were\r\ngreatly annoyed and declared that Toreno's fall was due to English\r\nintrigue.[361] Villiers, it was perfectly true, had taken part in\r\nthe negotiations which had preceded the change of government. He had\r\ndiscussed the situation, not only with Toreno and Mendizabal, but\r\nwith the Queen Regent herself. To Christina he explained that he had\r\nno authority to speak in the name of the British government. She,\r\nhowever, replied that she required no more than \"the advice of an\r\nEnglishman in whom she had entire confidence.\" Villiers, therefore,\r\ntold her plainly that, inasmuch as she had not the necessary force at\r\nher disposal for arresting by violent means the advance of democracy,\r\nshe must submit to the formation of a more Liberal government. The\r\nQueen's dread of Mendizabal appears to have been overcome temporarily\r\nby Villiers' assurance that that statesman had no intention of\r\nrestoring the Constitution of 1812.[362]\r\n\r\nAfter the downfall of the _Moderados_, the French authorities no\r\nlonger attempted to prevent supplies from reaching the Carlists. Upon\r\nthe road from Bayonne to Irun, an uninterrupted stream of waggons\r\nwas to be seen openly conveying stores and provisions of all kinds\r\nto the insurgents.[363] The Pretender, wrote Villiers, had received\r\nassurances from Louis Philippe that in the future he intended to\r\nremain absolutely neutral.[364] To all representations upon this\r\nsubject, whether made by the British or the Spanish ambassador, the\r\nFrench ministers returned evasive replies. Although from time to\r\ntime Lord Granville succeeded in extracting a promise that greater\r\nvigilance would be exercised upon the frontier, the lucrative trade,\r\nwhich the inhabitants of southern France were carrying on with the\r\narmies of the Pretender, was never interfered with seriously.\r\n\r\nMendizabal, in the meantime, was devoting himself assiduously to the\r\ntask of prosecuting the war against Don Carlos. But his efforts to\r\ncarry on the operations vigorously were hampered by the penury of the\r\ntreasury, and by the impossibility of raising a loan abroad. It was\r\nunder these circumstances that he made a proposal to Mr. Villiers\r\nwhich, when it was divulged to the Duc de Broglie, increased the\r\nill-feeling which was rapidly growing up between the French and the\r\nEnglish governments. Modern views about the advantages of unrestricted\r\ncommercial intercourse had not as yet penetrated into Spain. The\r\nimposition of prohibitory duties upon almost all articles made\r\nabroad was still regarded as essential for the protection of Spanish\r\ntrade. England necessarily suffered greatly from this system, which\r\nbrought no revenue into the Spanish exchequer, and benefited only\r\nthe smuggler. The question had often been the subject of discussion\r\nbetween the two governments, but Spain had hitherto always evaded her\r\npromises to reform her tariff. Mendizabal, however, now undertook\r\nthat, provided England would guarantee the interest of a loan of a\r\nmillion and a half sterling, Spain would admit the chief articles of\r\nBritish manufacture upon a low scale of duty. Villiers was without\r\nauthority to conclude any agreement of that kind. But, as Mendizabal\r\nassured him that any delay would be most inconvenient, he decided to\r\ndraw up the necessary documents. The moment the treaty had been signed\r\nby Mendizabal and himself, he forwarded it to Palmerston, explaining\r\nthe reasons which had led him to act without instructions. \"The\r\nQueen,\" he wrote in conclusion, \"Mendizabal and his English private\r\nsecretary, Southern,[365] and himself, were the only persons who had\r\nany knowledge of the transaction.\"[366]\r\n\r\nWhen the projected agreement and Villiers' covering despatch reached\r\nParis, whither they had been transmitted, as was the custom, under\r\nflying seal, Granville was so impressed with the necessity of keeping\r\nthe matter secret, that he did not even allow the _attachés_ of his\r\nembassy to know of the affair. Furthermore, his own observations upon\r\nthe subject were conveyed to Lord Palmerston in a private letter.\r\n\"It will not be liked here,\" he warned his chief. \"It is already\r\nthought that Mendizabal is entirely under English influence, and this\r\nadmission of English manufactures at a reduced duty, even though\r\npurchased by the guarantee of a loan, will very much confirm the\r\nimpression.\"[367] But all these precautions were of no avail. Within a\r\nfew days, Broglie received intelligence of the transaction both from\r\nthe French ambassador at Madrid, and from some Spanish agent in Paris.\r\nIt seems highly probable that the secret was disclosed by Christina\r\nherself. Perhaps she wished to ingratiate herself with Louis Philippe,\r\nwhilst by exposing Mendizabal to his wrath, she may have hoped to\r\nfacilitate the return to power of the _Moderados_.\r\n\r\nM. de Rayneval having obtained his information \"under the seal of the\r\nmost profound secrecy,\" Broglie could not make representations on the\r\nsubject of the proposed treaty to the British government. Rayneval,\r\nhowever, was directed to protest against it at Madrid, and to warn\r\nMendizabal that, if the affair were to be concluded, \"the Quadruple\r\nAlliance would certainly undergo modifications of a nature which Spain\r\nwould regret.\"[368] But the British government, in the meanwhile,\r\n\"whilst fully appreciating the motives which had prompted Villiers\r\nto sign the treaty without instructions,\" had decided not to advise\r\nthe King to ratify it. \"His Majesty's government,\" wrote Palmerston,\r\n\"does not consider that it would be consistent with the spirit of the\r\nalliance that two out of four should make separately, and without\r\nprevious communication with the others, an engagement. . . . Great\r\nBritain would expose herself to the charge of having severed herself\r\nfrom her allies in order to grasp at an object conducive to her own\r\nparticular interests.\"[369] At the same time, however, he enclosed\r\nthe project of a new commercial treaty, which Villiers was to invite\r\nMendizabal to consider. England, according to its provisions, asked\r\nfor no exclusive advantages, the only stipulation being that British\r\ngoods should be placed upon a footing of equality with those of the\r\nmost favoured nation. The Spanish minister, however, professed his\r\ninability to proceed with the matter. Great Britain's guarantee to a\r\nloan was a condition, he declared, essential to the conclusion of any\r\ncommercial treaty. The proposal to admit English cotton goods would be\r\ndeeply resented by Spanish manufacturers, and he must, in consequence,\r\nbe in a position to show that, by consenting to it, he had gained\r\nsome great political advantage.[370] Without doubt, also, he was not\r\ninsensible to Broglie's threats. He foresaw that, although there was\r\nto be no concealment about Palmerston's treaty, and notwithstanding\r\nthat France was to be given full information about the negotiations,\r\nher objections to the \"reciprocal equality,\" and \"mutual facilities,\"\r\nfor which England stipulated, would not on that account be diminished.\r\nNor was he mistaken. When the matter was revived under the ministry\r\nof Comte Molé, that statesman summed up the French case with perfect\r\nfrankness. Equality of opportunity for trading in Spain, he informed\r\nLord Granville, would act solely for the benefit of England, seeing\r\nthat the French merchants were possessed of less capital, and\r\nwere less industrious and enterprising than their British rivals.\r\nPalmerston, as may be supposed, entered with zest upon the task of\r\ndenouncing the selfishness of founding an objection to a reform of\r\nthe Spanish tariff upon so unworthy a reason.[371]\r\n\r\nBroglie's instructions to Rayneval respecting the commercial\r\ntreaty were among his last acts as Minister for Foreign Affairs.\r\nParliamentary and other difficulties, in the creation of which\r\nLouis Philippe is supposed to have taken a part, brought about the\r\nresignation of the government. M. Thiers, thereupon, notwithstanding\r\nthat he had been a member of Broglie's Cabinet, undertook to form a\r\nnew ministry. At the time of the Revolution of July, M. Thiers had\r\nbeen known merely as one of the editors of the _National_ and as\r\nthe author of a very popular and successful _History of the French\r\nRevolution_. Louis Philippe's enthronement, in which he had been so\r\nprominently concerned, enabled him to abandon journalism and to embark\r\nupon the career of a politician. Only two years later, on October 11,\r\n1832, he was appointed Minister of the Interior in Marshal Soult's\r\nfirst government. In that capacity, by means of a bribe judiciously\r\nadministered to the Jew Deutz, he succeeded in discovering the\r\nhiding-place of the Duchesse de Berri at Nantes--a mystery which,\r\nuntil he took the matter in hand, had baffled the ingenuity of the\r\npolice. Having accomplished this object and having no desire to be\r\nremembered in history as \"the Fouché of the Monarchy of July,\" he\r\npromptly exchanged the portfolio of the Interior for that of Commerce\r\nand of Public Works.[372]\r\n\r\nEver since the conclusion of the Quadruple Treaty, Louis Philippe had\r\nbeen quietly endeavouring to improve his relations with the absolute\r\nPowers, in general, and with Austria, in particular. Early in the\r\nyear 1835 he appears to have embarked, without the knowledge of his\r\nministers or of Sainte-Aulaire, the French ambassador at Vienna,\r\nupon a confidential correspondence with Metternich.[373] Without\r\ndoubt, his flattering advances to the Chancellor were made with the\r\nhope that a marriage might be arranged between his eldest son, the\r\nDuc d'Orléans, and an Austrian Archduchess. Neither Broglie nor\r\nSainte-Aulaire shared the King's illusions on that subject. Broglie\r\nwas firmly convinced that there could be no intimacy between the\r\nMonarchy of July and the Northern Courts, and it was chiefly on that\r\naccount that Louis Philippe had been so anxious to drive him from\r\noffice. But, whilst Louis Philippe had frequently been annoyed by the\r\nindependence and uncompromising honesty of the _Doctrinaire_ Duke, he\r\nhad always admired the resourcefulness and political adroitness of M.\r\nThiers. For some time past M. Thiers had been desirous of obtaining\r\nthe portfolio of Foreign Affairs, and he appears to have satisfied\r\nthe King that, were it to be confided to him, he would promote the\r\ndynastic object which was constantly in His Majesty's mind. He was,\r\nit was said, greatly attracted by the prospect of raising \"the\r\nmatrimonial blockade\" which the Legitimists exultingly declared had\r\nbeen established round the Orleans throne.[374]\r\n\r\nIt has generally been supposed that Talleyrand was largely responsible\r\nfor the overtures made to the Court of Vienna by Louis Philippe, and\r\nfor the coolness which set in, about the same time, in the relations\r\nof France and England. This view of the case may be correct, but it is\r\ndifficult to believe that the reasons, usually given to explain his\r\nchanged attitude towards England, can be true. At the end of the year\r\n1834 Talleyrand had retired from his embassy in London. His advanced\r\nage and his increasing infirmities were the reasons officially given\r\nfor his resignation. It was notorious, however, that he had been\r\nfrequently annoyed by Palmerston's unceremonious behaviour towards\r\nhim, and it has been suggested that the lack of deference with which\r\nhe had been treated had caused him greatly to modify his opinions\r\nabout the advantages of a close friendship with England.[375] It is,\r\nhowever, most improbable that Talleyrand, who, up to the time of his\r\ndeparture from London, unceasingly endeavoured to extend the scope of\r\nthe alliance,[376] should have changed his views completely, because\r\nPalmerston may have kept him waiting in an ante-room or may have\r\nfailed to treat him with that respect to which his age and his long\r\ndiplomatic career entitled him. Nevertheless, it is not to be denied\r\nthat, notwithstanding the marked attentions which had been paid him at\r\nCourt and in London society, he had returned to France in a somewhat\r\ndissatisfied frame of mind. The recently published memoirs of the\r\nDuchesse de Dino show plainly that, in 1834, he no longer entertained\r\nhis former admiration for England and English institutions. But it\r\nwas to the new conditions created by the Reform Act that his altered\r\ndispositions should be ascribed. Although he had been in favour\r\nof that measure, in his heart he, doubtless, loathed the idea of\r\ngovernment by the people. Like Lord Grey himself, once the Bill had\r\nbecome an accomplished fact, he was horrified at the ugly aspect of\r\ndemocracy. Believing, therefore, that Great Britain was advancing\r\nrapidly towards a revolution he would naturally counsel Louis Philippe\r\nto draw as close as circumstances would permit to conservative\r\nAustria.[377] Nor was there anything in this advice which should be\r\nregarded as unfriendly towards England. At Vienna in 1814, be it\r\nremembered, he had insisted upon the necessity of an alliance between\r\nFrance, Great Britain and Austria, as the only means of checking the\r\ninsatiable ambition of Russia.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the civil war in Spain continued and the prospects of\r\nthe constitutional cause were gloomy. During the summer of 1835,\r\nhowever, the Carlists sustained a loss the magnitude of which was\r\nhardly appreciated at the time. Whilst superintending the operations\r\nagainst Bilbao Zumalacárregui sustained a wound and died a few days\r\nlater. The original injury was of a trifling character and his\r\ndeath has generally been ascribed to the unskilful treatment of the\r\ndoctors. But Colonel Wylde, as he was returning from his interview\r\nwith the Pretender on the subject of the Decree of Durango, received\r\nsome curious details about the last hours of the famous Carlist\r\nchief from an English surgeon who had dressed his wound. According\r\nto this person, a dose of laudanum, not a _Christino_ bullet, was\r\nthe cause of death. Furthermore, Wylde's informant asserted that the\r\ndoctors had under various pretexts refused to allow the body to be\r\nopened. This story, taken in connection with the detestation with\r\nwhich Zumalacárregui was regarded by the _Apostolical_ section of his\r\nparty, led Wylde to suspect that he might have been the victim of foul\r\nplay.[378] Be that as it may, his death had an effect upon the cause\r\nof absolutism and bigotry which may be compared with that of Dundee at\r\nKillikrankie.\r\n\r\nThe _Christinos_, however, appeared incapable of taking advantage\r\nof the loss which their opponents had sustained. Even Mendizabal\r\nwas unable to infuse the required energy into the counsels of the\r\nQueen's generals. \"Everything,\" wrote Wylde on February 12, 1836,\r\n\"seems to stagnate for want of money.\" The British legion had\r\nsuffered cruelly during the winter. Sickness had thinned its ranks,\r\nthe pay of officers and men was in arrears, and the whole force was\r\nin a state of acute discontent.[379] Under these circumstances the\r\nBritish government decided to intervene more effectually. Hitherto,\r\nLord John Hay's squadron off the north coast of Spain had only\r\nbeen allowed to transport troops and stores, and to give indirect\r\nassistance to the _Christinos_. But the admiral was now ordered to\r\ntake an active part in the operations of the Queen's armies. At the\r\nsame time, Lord Palmerston's objections to the entry of a French\r\narmy into Spain disappeared completely. He asked that the French\r\n_cordon_ of observation should be advanced across the frontier and\r\nthat the valley of Bastan should be occupied. The measure which he\r\nproposed \"would not entail extensive military operations, but would\r\nenable General Cordoba to enclose the Carlists in a small space\r\nand to deprive them of all supplies.\"[380] The British government,\r\ndoubtless, hoped that M. Thiers, who had always professed to be in\r\nfavour of armed intervention, would, now that he was President of\r\nthe Council, be able to induce Louis Philippe to consent to it. But\r\nthat illusion, if it was ever entertained, was soon dispelled. The\r\ncourse proposed by Palmerston was incompatible with that policy of\r\nconciliating the absolute Courts, upon which M. Thiers had embarked.\r\nHe was, consequently, compelled to explain to Lord Granville that he\r\nhad altogether changed his mind about the expediency of intervention,\r\nowing to the wide development of the Carlist insurrection, and to the\r\nrevolutionary character which the government at Madrid had recently\r\nassumed. Louis Philippe expressed himself in more emphatic language.\r\nNever, he told the British ambassador, would he allow the French flag\r\nto be carried beyond the frontier.[381]\r\n\r\nThe unsatisfactory progress of the war necessarily had a damaging\r\neffect upon the position of Mendizabal's Cabinet. Dissensions broke\r\nout among his followers, and Christina, who had only accepted him\r\nwith reluctance, most unwisely decided to dismiss him. She had been\r\nprompted to take this disastrous step, Palmerston suspected, by her\r\nFrench advisers.[382] The dissolution of the Cortes, which the change\r\nof ministry entailed, was followed by a most suspicious inaction on\r\nthe part of the Queen's generals. The Carlists, on the other hand,\r\ndisplayed unwonted activity. Insurgent bands penetrated to within\r\ntwenty miles of La Granja, where the Queen Regent was in residence.\r\nRamon Cabrera, \"the Tiger of the Maestrargo,\" who, as a reprisal for\r\nthe murder of his mother, refused to recognize the Eliot Convention,\r\ndesolated Aragon, whilst de Lacy Evans, on July 11, 1836, suffered a\r\nreverse at Fuentarabia, on which occasion all the British prisoners\r\nwere shot, in accordance with the Pretender's decree.[383] Meanwhile,\r\nthe _Progressistas_ were carrying all before them at the elections,\r\nand their victories were followed by grave revolutionary outbreaks.\r\nBut neither civil disorder nor military disasters could rouse M.\r\nIsturiz, the new President of the Council, or his colleagues to\r\naction. In the words of Mr. Villiers, \"they appeared to consider that\r\ncalmness in adversity constituted the whole duty of the responsible\r\nadvisers of the crown.\"[384]\r\n\r\nThe condition of affairs rapidly assumed a most alarming appearance.\r\nThe Constitution of 1812, was proclaimed in many of the chief towns.\r\nAt Madrid, Quesada, the Captain-General, disarmed the national guards,\r\nand declared the city in a state of siege, whilst at La Granja, the\r\nQueen Regent announced her firm intention of resisting the demands\r\nof the revolutionists. But, on the evening of August 12, her guards\r\nmutinied, and, led by their sergeants, invaded the palace. On two\r\nnights in succession, the unfortunate Christina was compelled to\r\nreceive deputations of non-commissioned officers, many of whom were\r\nunder the influence of liquor. Circumstanced as she was, with no loyal\r\ntroops at her disposal, she had no alternative but to yield. After\r\npromising to accept the Constitution of 1812, to raise the state of\r\nsiege, and to re-establish the national guards, she was allowed to\r\ndepart for the capital. But when the news of these events reached\r\nMadrid, the people rose, murdered Quesada, and carried his head in\r\ntriumph through the streets. Order was, however, gradually restored by\r\nCalatrava, the _Progressista_ minister, whom the revolted sergeants\r\nhad imposed upon Christina.[385]\r\n\r\nSome weeks before these events took place M. Thiers had had to abandon\r\nall hope of bringing his matrimonial negotiations to a successful\r\nconclusion. It was in vain that he had refused to join with England\r\nin protesting against the Austrian occupation of the free town\r\nof Cracow. It was to no purpose that he had forced the Federal\r\ngovernment to expel all political refugees from Switzerland. The Duc\r\nd'Orléans'[386] proposal for the hand of an Austrian Archduchess was\r\ndeclined. In order to hide his discomfiture and to punish Metternich,\r\nM. Thiers resolved to take up the Spanish affair vigorously. Direct\r\nintervention, however, he looked upon as out of the question. Not\r\nonly would the King oppose it, but it would be very unpopular with\r\nthe country. Nevertheless, by a process to which he gave the name\r\nof \"armed co-operation\" he proposed to attain the desired result.\r\nHe prepared, accordingly, largely to reinforce the French legion\r\nin Spain, which he intended should be commanded by some well-known\r\ngeneral. Louis Philippe reluctantly assented to these initial\r\nproceedings, but, when the news arrived of the military revolt at La\r\nGranja, he promptly placed his _veto_ upon all measures of that kind.\r\nNever, he declared, would he allow assistance to be supplied to the\r\nJacobins in power at Madrid.[387] Thiers and his fellow-ministers, in\r\nconsequence, resigned.\r\n\r\nUnder Molé, to whom the King confided the portfolio of Foreign Affairs\r\nand the formation of a new Cabinet, France for all practical purposes\r\nwithdrew from the Quadruple Treaty. The _depôts_ formed by Thiers were\r\nbroken up and three battalions, which he had raised for the service of\r\nQueen Isabella, were sent to Algiers. It would be highly dangerous,\r\nMolé informed the British ambassador, to expose French soldiers to the\r\ninfluence of the revolutionary societies in Spain.[388] In vain Lord\r\nPalmerston protested that in no way could the spirit of anarchy be\r\ncombated so effectually as by the expulsion of Don Carlos from the\r\nPeninsula.[389] That argument and his contention that the stability of\r\nthe Orleans monarchy depended upon the triumph of the constitutional\r\ncause in Spain were alike unheeded.[390] In order to show their\r\ndispleasure at the manner in which the French government was thus\r\nevading its engagements, Lord Melbourne and his colleagues decided\r\nto omit the customary reference to France from the King's Speech at\r\nthe opening of Parliament in 1837. But the \"no mention\" incident,\r\nalthough it caused Louis Philippe the keenest annoyance and created a\r\ngreat sensation in Paris,[391] had no effect upon Molé's resolution\r\nto refuse assistance of any kind to the government at Madrid. The\r\nonly safe policy for France, the King informed Granville a few months\r\nlater, was to look upon Spain as infected with the plague and to have\r\nas little communication with her as possible.[392]\r\n\r\nAlthough Calatrava, whom the sergeants at La Granja had raised to\r\nthe head of the Queen Regent's government, was invariably spoken of\r\nby Louis Philippe and Comte Molé as a dangerous revolutionist, he\r\nwas far from deserving that appellation. Not only was he successful\r\nin infusing a certain vigour into the conduct of the war, but he\r\ncontrived, in addition, to frame a constitution which, in spite of its\r\nimperfections, effected a happy compromise between the Jacobinical\r\ncode of 1812 and the ultra-monarchical _Estatuto Real_. The year\r\n1836 closed with a brilliant success for the arms of the Queen\r\nRegent. Powerfully assisted by the bluejackets and marines of Lord\r\nJohn Hay's squadron, the _Christinos_ stormed the formidable lines\r\nof Luchana and relieved the city of Bilbao. Henceforward the name\r\nof Baldomero Espartero, the victorious general, was to figure very\r\nprominently in Spanish politics. Nevertheless, during the campaign of\r\nthe ensuing year, complete success appeared to be within the grasp\r\nof the Pretender. Eluding Espartero, who was preparing to attack him\r\nin the Basque provinces, Don Carlos, who had been liberally supplied\r\nwith money by the Tsar and the Kings of the Netherlands[393] and of\r\nSardinia, marched southwards on Madrid. But, when the capital lay at\r\ntheir mercy, his generals were ordered to retrace their footsteps,\r\nrecross the Ebro and re-enter the northern provinces.\r\n\r\nVarious reasons have been given for the sudden retreat of the Carlists\r\nfrom before Madrid.[394] The most probable explanation appears to be\r\nthat Don Carlos had secretly arranged with Christina that, upon the\r\narrival of his army in the vicinity of the capital, the gates were to\r\nbe thrown open, and that the marriage of his son with Isabella was\r\nto be announced and peace proclaimed.[395] It would seem, however,\r\nthat at the last moment Christina decided that this scheme was\r\nimpracticable and the Pretender, finding, in consequence, that no\r\nmovement in his favour was likely to break out in Madrid, gave the\r\norder to retreat. The remainder of the year 1837 was spent by the\r\nCarlist leaders in fierce quarrels and bitter recriminations. But the\r\ncondition of the Queen's armies was still more pitiable. Officers\r\nand men were unpaid and wholly without confidence in their generals.\r\nHorrible excesses were committed by the mutinous regiments. Generals\r\nEscalera and Sarsfield were murdered by their men, and, although\r\nEspartero upon his arrival from Madrid, succeeded in restoring some\r\nsemblance of discipline, he dared not undertake offensive operations\r\nwith troops so completely demoralized.\r\n\r\nThe Pretender's advance upon Madrid proved fatal to the Calatrava\r\nCabinet. That government, which had been created by the action of\r\nthe sergeants at La Granja, was destroyed by a _pronunciamento_ on\r\nthe part of the officers of a brigade which had been hurried south,\r\nwhen Don Carlos was threatening the capital.[396] The downfall of\r\nthe _Progressista_ Cabinet was, doubtless, one of the reasons which\r\nled the Queen Regent to break her compact with the Pretender. A\r\ntransition ministry was formed, whilst Christina cautiously prepared\r\nto recall the _Moderados_. Throughout the country party differences\r\nwere submerged in the general desire for peace, and the opinion was\r\nrapidly gaining ground that, without French assistance, the Pretender\r\ncould never be expelled. This idea was sedulously encouraged by\r\nthe Court party, and, as was suspected, by agents of the French\r\ngovernment. These conditions at the elections, at the close of the\r\nyear 1837, produced an overwhelming majority for the _Moderados_.\r\nIt was soon evident, however, that the electors had been completely\r\ndeluded in imagining that the triumph of the Conservative party would\r\nbe followed by French intervention. The political effacement of the\r\n_Progressistas_ had not altered the determination of Louis Philippe\r\nand Comte Molé to withhold all assistance from the government of the\r\nQueen Regent.[397]\r\n\r\nVilliers, the British minister at Madrid, was now convinced that\r\nin the dissensions of the Carlists lay the only hope of preserving\r\nthe crown for Isabella. The animosity was extreme between the\r\n_Provinciales_, whose chief object in supporting the Pretender was\r\nto ensure the maintenance of their highly prized _Fueros_, and the\r\n_Castillanos_, as that section of the party was called which followed\r\nthe lead of the fanatical Bishop of Léon.[398] In order to widen\r\nthis breach Villiers instructed Lieutenant Turner, a British officer\r\nattached to the division of the Queen's army at Pampeluna, to open up\r\na secret communication with the discontented Navarrese chiefs. Turner\r\nexperienced little difficulty in executing his mission, and was soon\r\nable to report that the men of Biscay and Navarre would be prepared\r\nto discuss terms of peace upon the basis of the recognition of their\r\nlocal rights and privileges. But all the leaders with whom he had\r\nconferred had stipulated that any compromise which, might be arrived\r\nat, must have the guarantee of Great Britain.[399]\r\n\r\nThe news of these proceedings was most agreeable to Lord Palmerston,\r\nwho forthwith drew up precise instructions for the future conduct\r\nof the negotiations. Whilst suggesting that on the subject of the\r\n_Fueros_ the Queen Regent's government would be well advised to make\r\nconcessions, he laid it down distinctly that Great Britain could\r\nnot guarantee the conditions of peace.[400] A copy of this despatch\r\nwas sent to Lord Granville in Paris, who was directed to invite the\r\nFrench government to act with England in the affair. In Palmerston's\r\nopinion it was most important to draw France \"into an open and avowed\r\nmediation for the purpose of reuniting the northern provinces to the\r\nrest of the Spanish dominions.\"[401] He was convinced that Louis\r\nPhilippe cherished secret hopes that the civil war might lead to the\r\nsecession of Biscay and Navarre and their incorporation into France.\r\nThere can be little doubt that he was entirely mistaken in imagining\r\nthat either the King of the French or his ministers entertained any\r\nviews of this kind. It is possible, however, that the separatist\r\nmovement, which unquestionably existed in Catalonia, may have been\r\nencouraged by French agents, with the object of preventing the\r\nconclusion of a commercial treaty with England. The threat of the\r\nmanufacturers of Barcelona that the Catalans would proclaim their\r\nindependence, should the duty upon English cotton goods be lowered,\r\nwas one of the chief reasons which deterred the Cabinet of Madrid from\r\naccepting Palmerston's commercial proposals.[402]\r\n\r\nLouis Philippe, however, would not hear of allowing the French\r\nambassador to be the organ of any communications with the discontented\r\nCarlist chieftains. He had been accused most unfairly, he told Lord\r\nGranville, of sympathizing with Don Carlos, and to accede to the\r\nBritish request would expose him to further suspicion.[403] A new\r\nFrench ambassador was at this moment about to proceed to Madrid, who\r\nappears to have been admirably adapted for the part which the King\r\ndesired that his envoy should play at Christina's Court, whilst the\r\nissue of the struggle between constitutionalism and absolutism was so\r\nextremely uncertain. \"A more inoffensive person,\" wrote the British\r\n_chargé d'affaires_ about a year later, \"than the Duc de Fezensac does\r\nnot exist. He has no political principles and has never taken the\r\nslightest interest in the questions which agitate the country. I have\r\nobserved that, as a soldier, he would now and then demonstrate some\r\ncuriosity about the movements of the armies and seem glad when the\r\nadvantage had been on the side of the Queen's troops.\"[404]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Mr. Turner's secret relations with the Navarrese\r\nchiefs had been betrayed. The sudden imprisonment of the disaffected\r\nofficers and the murder of one of his emissaries compelled him to\r\nsuspend his proceedings.[405] A counter-insurrection, however, broke\r\nout against Don Carlos to the cry of \"_Peace and the Fueros_,\" under\r\nthe leadership of an individual named Muñagorri. From Bayonne,\r\nwhere \"the French authorities coldly permitted him to remain,\" he\r\nendeavoured to foment disaffection in, and to encourage desertion\r\nfrom, the Pretender's armies.[406] Villiers at one time expected great\r\nresults from this new development, but, before long, he was forced\r\nto realize that Muñagorri, a Basque lawyer, had not the influence\r\nrequired for bringing the enterprise to a successful conclusion.[407]\r\n\r\nNever, in the opinion of both Villiers and of Wylde, had the\r\nconstitutional cause presented so gloomy an appearance as in the\r\nclosing months of the year 1838. The Queen's generals had suffered\r\nheavy defeats in the open field and Espartero had been compelled\r\nto abandon his operations against Morella, Cabrera's stronghold.\r\nPolitical rather than strategical considerations appear to have\r\ndictated the conduct of the campaign. Fearing that Espartero might\r\ngrow too powerful, the Cabinet was suspected of having deliberately\r\nneglected to reinforce him, whilst keeping his rival and enemy,\r\nNarvaez, who commanded the army of reserve, liberally supplied with\r\ntroops.[408] In England no minister would have ventured to propose\r\nthat any further assistance, either in men or money, should be sent\r\nto the _Christinos_, who had greatly fallen in the public estimation.\r\nThe commercial classes were indignant that, notwithstanding the help\r\nwhich the Queen's cause had received, prohibitory duties upon British\r\nmanufactures should still be maintained. The newspapers were full of\r\nthe complaints of the soldiers of the legion, who had returned home\r\nwith their claims upon the Spanish treasury unsatisfied. The policy of\r\nencouraging these men to enter Isabella's services was now universally\r\ncondemned. The good name of the British army had, it was feared,\r\nsuffered from their misconduct at the seat of war. The action of the\r\ngovernment, in conferring a knighthood of the Bath upon De Lacy Evans,\r\nin no way lessened this impression.[409]\r\n\r\nBut, in the early spring of 1839, the news arrived of strange\r\nproceedings in the Pretender's camp. Maroto, the Carlist\r\ncommander-in-chief, having discovered the existence of a plot to\r\noverthrow him, had caused four general officers to be shot at Estella,\r\non February 18. Don Carlos, who was in secret sympathy with the\r\nconspirators, thereupon deprived Maroto of his command and proclaimed\r\nhim a traitor. That officer, however, knew that he could count upon\r\nthe devotion of his men, and he, accordingly, boldly marched upon\r\nTolosa, where the wretched Don Carlos was residing, and compelled him\r\nboth to revoke his decree and to dismiss his _Apostolical_ advisers.\r\nBut Maroto, although he had on this occasion triumphed so completely,\r\nwas well aware that at any moment his troops might turn against\r\nhim, and that his life depended upon a speedy termination of the\r\nwar. Notwithstanding that Turner's attempts to incite the Navarrese\r\nchieftains to rebellion had failed, and that Muñagorri's insurrection\r\nhad practically collapsed, the longing for peace had not diminished\r\namong the men of Biscay and Navarre. After the executions at Estella\r\nand his coercion of Don Carlos, Maroto had no alternative but to adopt\r\nthe popular cry of \"_Paz y Fueros_.\" Instead of an obscure lawyer, the\r\ncommander-in-chief of the Pretender's armies was now at the head of\r\nthe counter-insurrection against him.[410]\r\n\r\nWhilst the Carlist general had thus the strongest possible inducement\r\nfor coming to terms with the _Christinos_, other circumstances had\r\narisen which contributed to the undoing of the Pretender. Espartero\r\nwas now all powerful and in a position to carry on the war,\r\nuntrammelled by the intrigues of the Court and of the Cabinet.[411]\r\nIn France Molé had fallen and Soult was once more at the head of\r\nthe government. The Marshal, in the previous year, had represented\r\nLouis Philippe at the coronation of Queen Victoria, and had returned\r\nto France delighted with the welcome accorded him in London by all\r\nclasses of the population.[412] He was, consequently, very well\r\ndisposed towards England and far more inclined than any of his\r\npredecessors to act up to the spirit of the Quadruple Treaty. No\r\nsooner was he in power than orders were sent to the French ships,\r\nstationed off the north coast of Spain, identical in every respect\r\nwith those with which the British admiral was furnished. At the same\r\ntime, the authorities upon the frontier were strictly enjoined both\r\nto prevent supplies from reaching the Carlists and to embarrass the\r\nmovements of the Pretender's armies by all means in their power.[413]\r\n\r\nMaroto's first definite proposals of peace seem to have been made to\r\nLord John Hay, either on July 27 or 28. It is probable, however, that\r\nfor some time past he had been in more or less direct communication\r\nwith Espartero, with whom he had served in South America. The\r\nnegotiations, once formally begun, continued for the next month.\r\nEspartero, however, wisely refused to grant any suspension of\r\nhostilities, and, whilst showing himself always ready to listen to\r\nreasonable proposals, pushed on his military operations vigorously.\r\nThe question which proved the most difficult of settlement was that\r\nof the _Fueros_, which the Biscayans and Navarrese stipulated must\r\nbe maintained in their integrity. The Queen Regent's government,\r\nin accordance with Palmerston's advice, was only prepared to make\r\nsuch concessions with regard to them, as might be compatible with\r\nthe representative form of government which Spain had adopted. The\r\nrecognition of the sovereignty of Isabella, the regency of Christina\r\nand the Constitution of 1837 were also insisted upon. Colonel Wylde\r\nwas present at most of the conferences which took place. He was\r\nauthorized to explain to any Carlist officers, with whom he might be\r\nenabled to converse, that, \"although it would not be consistent with\r\nthe dignity of the Spanish nation that Her Majesty's government should\r\nguarantee any arrangement, they could rely upon the good offices of\r\nthe British government should, at any time, the government of Madrid\r\ndepart from its agreements.\"[414]\r\n\r\nEspartero's skilful conduct of the negotiations, combined with the\r\npersonal reasons which made it imperative for Maroto to conclude\r\na peace, triumphed at last over all obstacles. On August 29, a\r\nconvention was signed at Vergara settling the points in dispute and\r\nproviding for the capitulation of Maroto's army. Two days later the\r\n21 battalions specified in the treaty marched into the camp of the\r\n_Christinos_ and, having been harangued by Espartero, proceeded\r\nto fraternize joyfully with the Queen's troops.[415] Don Carlos,\r\nnevertheless, was still able to command the fidelity of a certain\r\nnumber of his regiments. But Espartero, the moment the capitulation\r\nof Maroto's people had been completed, pressed these remnants of\r\nthe insurgent army with the utmost vigour. Their resistance was\r\nsoon overcome, and, on September 15, 1839, Don Carlos with a few\r\nthousand followers was driven across the frontier. On reaching French\r\nterritory they were at once disarmed, the Pretender and the members\r\nof his family being conveyed to Bourges, where they were detained\r\nunder strict supervision. It was not without difficulty that Louis\r\nPhilippe's ministers had obtained his consent to that measure of\r\nprecaution.\r\n\r\nAlthough Don Carlos had abandoned the struggle, Cabrera in the\r\nMaestrargo, and the no less bloodthirsty Count of España in Catalonia,\r\nstill carried on the war with ruthless barbarity. In November,\r\nhowever, España, having incurred the displeasure of the Carlist\r\n_junta_, was removed from his command. His body shortly afterwards\r\nwas taken out of the river Segre \"tied neck and heels.\"[416] Without\r\ndoubt he had been murdered by the escort which was supposed to convey\r\nhim to a place of confinement. But it was not till the month of July,\r\n1840, that Espartero succeeded in driving Cabrera and his lieutenant,\r\nBalmaceda, into France and in breaking up the last of the Carlist\r\nbands.\r\n\r\nSpain, however, was not destined to enjoy the blessings of internal\r\npeace and tranquillity. Christina had never really accepted the\r\nprinciples of constitutional government, and most of the leading\r\n_Moderados_ shared her dislike to democratic institutions. With the\r\nobject, accordingly, of rendering nugatory certain of the Liberal\r\nprovisions of the constitution the party, during the session of 1840,\r\nintroduced a bill abolishing the election of municipal officers, and\r\nestablishing a system under which they were, in the future, to be\r\nappointed by the central government. The Spaniards, however, have\r\nalways been tenacious of their municipal rights and privileges, and\r\nthe proposed law was, in consequence, greatly disliked by the people.\r\nThe Queen Regent and her _Moderado_ advisers would have cared little\r\nfor popular opposition, provided always that they could have obtained\r\nthe support of one man. \"Espartero,\" in the words of Mr. Southern,\r\nthe British _chargé d'affaires_, \"now formed one of the bodies of the\r\nState.\"[417] The general who had succeeded in terminating the civil\r\nwar was, for the time being, the idol of the nation.\r\n\r\nEspartero, however, was deaf to the blandishments of the _Moderados_,\r\nand publicly declared that he regarded the municipal bill as\r\nunconstitutional.[418] Christina, nevertheless, was confident that\r\nhe would never resist her personal appeal. She had always recognized\r\nthe importance of winning his gratitude. For his services he had been\r\ncreated Count of Luchana, Duke de la Victoria, and a Spanish grandee\r\nof the first class. After his capture of Cabrera's stronghold, in\r\n1840, she had conferred upon him the additional title of Duke of\r\nMorella. When the municipal law was under discussion in the Chamber,\r\nshe suddenly announced her intention of proceeding to Caldes, near\r\nBarcelona, with Isabella, who was alleged to have been ordered sea\r\nbathing. But the significance of her journey to the coast lay in the\r\nfact that it would enable her to meet, and to confer with, Espartero,\r\nwho was directing the final operations in Cabrera's country.[419] Her\r\ninterview with the all-powerful general took place, in due course, at\r\nLerida, but it disappointed her expectations. Espartero advised her\r\nstrongly to refuse her assent to the bill, although it had been passed\r\nby both Chambers. It was notorious that the _Moderado_ majority had\r\nbeen obtained by means of corruption and intimidation at the elections\r\nof the previous year, and that it in no way represented the will of\r\nthe nation. Christina wavered. At one time she decided to follow the\r\ncounsels of Espartero, at another she resolved to adhere firmly to\r\nher _Moderado_ policy. Meanwhile, the country was growing dangerously\r\nexcited, and Barcelona was the scene of serious rioting. Christina, in\r\nconsequence, decided to move the Court to Valencia, where O'Donnell,\r\non whom she could depend, commanded the troops. Upon her arrival, she\r\nboldly announced that she purposed to commission Modesto Cortazar,\r\na former minister of Joseph Bonaparte, to form an ultra-_Moderado_\r\nCabinet. At the news, the country rose, _juntas_ sprang into existence\r\nin the principal towns, and a provisional government was established\r\nat Madrid.[420]\r\n\r\nVilliers was no longer at Madrid. On succeeding to the earldom of\r\nClarendon, he had returned home, where a seat in the Cabinet had been\r\nfound for him. When he learnt of the critical state of affairs in\r\nSpain, Palmerston at once directed Mr. Aston, Clarendon's successor,\r\nto seek out Christina, wherever she might be, and to attempt to\r\nconvince her of the imprudence of the course upon which she had\r\nembarked.[421] But before he could reach Valencia, she had abandoned\r\nthe struggle, and had sullenly surrendered the direction of affairs\r\nto Espartero. She fully intended, she informed Aston at his first\r\naudience, to resign the regency, and no words of his could turn her\r\nfrom her resolution.[422] It was not alone the desire to avoid the\r\ndisagreeable necessity of having to accept a _Progressista_ government\r\nwhich had prompted her to arrive at this decision. Gonzalez Bravo\r\nand the Radicals possessed the proof of her marriage to Nuñoz, the\r\nguardsman, by whom she had already had several children. In order\r\nto retain the regency, and especially the emoluments appertaining\r\nto it, she had allowed it to be generally believed that she was the\r\nmistress of the handsome and low-born soldier. But now that her secret\r\nhad been betrayed, her marriage might be adduced at any moment as a\r\nreason for declaring her incompetent to hold the post of Regent.[423]\r\nOnly by a voluntary abdication could she escape from this further\r\nhumiliation. Accordingly, on October 12, 1840, she signed the act\r\nwhereby she resigned the regency, and left it to the Cortes to appoint\r\nher successor. A few days later she parted from her daughters, and\r\nset out for France. On May 18 of the following year, Espartero was\r\nduly elected Regent, whilst Argüelles, a veteran _Progressista_, was\r\nnominated guardian of Queen Isabella.\r\n\r\nChristina's abdication passed almost unnoticed outside Spain. The\r\nquarrel between the Sultan and the Pasha had broken out afresh, and\r\nEngland and France were upon the verge of war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                           SULTAN AND PASHA\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that, in the autumn of 1833, both France\r\nand Great Britain ineffectually protested against the treaty of\r\nUnkiar-Skelessi. But so long as Russia and Austria were closely\r\nunited, neither Palmerston nor Broglie were prepared to enforce their\r\ndemands by actual measures of hostility. Both, however, were resolved\r\nvigilantly to watch the course of events at Constantinople, and to\r\ninterpose should the Russian fleet return to the Bosphorus. Being thus\r\nanxious to avoid a collision with Russia, it became their policy to\r\nprevent a fresh outbreak of hostilities between the Sultan and Mehemet\r\nAli, in order that the Tsar should be furnished with no excuse for\r\nintervention. It was soon apparent, however, that the preservation of\r\npeace between Mahmud and his powerful vassal would prove a difficult\r\nmatter. Already, in the summer of 1834, only a little more than a year\r\nafter the conclusion of the Convention of Kiutayeh, there was once\r\nmore grave danger of an armed conflict between the Sultan and the\r\nPasha of Egypt.\r\n\r\nIn 1832, the Syrians had welcomed Ibrahim as their deliverer from\r\nTurkish misrule. But no sooner had they become the subjects of the\r\nPasha, than their disenchantment began. The introduction of the\r\nconscription into Syria was fiercely resented. In the spring of 1834,\r\nthe whole country was in a state of rebellion, and it required\r\nsixteen months of arduous operations, attended with much bloodshed,\r\nbefore Ibrahim could disarm the tribes, and restore the authority of\r\nhis father over the revolted districts.[424] But in the eyes of the\r\nSultan, the insurrection was an opportunity for attacking Ibrahim\r\nunder favourable conditions, and for wiping out the humiliations of\r\nthe former campaign. Accordingly, he prepared to renew the struggle,\r\nand it was only in deference to the protests of the Powers that he\r\nrefrained from carrying out his intention.[425] At the same time the\r\nconsuls at Alexandria insisted that Mehemet Ali must strictly comply\r\nwith the conditions of the Convention of Kiutayeh, and afford Mahmud\r\nno pretext for beginning hostilities. Nevertheless, on September 4,\r\n1834, the Pasha officially informed the agents of the Powers that he\r\nwas resolved to proclaim his complete independence.[426] He soon,\r\nhowever, perceived the necessity of postponing the execution of this\r\ndesign, in face of the unanimous declaration of the different Cabinets\r\nthat he must abandon \"a project which the policy of Europe could not\r\nallow him to realize.\"[427]\r\n\r\nBut, although the five Powers thus combined to check the ambitious\r\nschemes of Mehemet Ali, the suspicion with which the policy of\r\nRussia towards Turkey was regarded by France and England was in no\r\nway diminished. So strained were the relations of Great Britain and\r\nRussia, at the beginning of 1834, that Nicholas, notwithstanding\r\nhis inveterate dislike of Louis Philippe, allowed Nesselrode to\r\nmake certain discreet advances towards France. These half-hearted\r\novertures, however, led to no results. Although Broglie indulged in\r\nless provocative language than the British minister, and deprecated\r\nthe idea of another naval demonstration in Levantine waters, he was\r\nin complete agreement with Palmerston in the eastern question.[428] A\r\npersonal dispute served to increase the tension which existed between\r\nthe Imperial Cabinet and the English government. Notwithstanding\r\nPrince Lieven's intimation that the Tsar would greatly dislike the\r\nappointment,[429] Palmerston had allowed Sir Stratford Canning\r\nto be gazetted as ambassador to the Russian Court. Nesselrode,\r\nthereupon, informed Mr. Bligh, the British _chargé d'affaires_, that\r\nSir Stratford would not be received. His \"suspicious, overbearing\r\nand irritable disposition\" appears to have been the reason assigned\r\nfor the objections which were made to his appointment. Palmerston,\r\nhowever, absolutely refused to send any one else in his place. \"The\r\nwhole thing,\" he believed or affected to believe, \"was a mere remnant\r\nof the _Apostolical_ and Holy Alliance abomination of the name of\r\nCanning.\"[430] But Nesselrode was equally unyielding and no British\r\nambassador was, in consequence, accredited to the Russian Court.\r\nMatters continued upon this footing until Nicholas, in the spring\r\nof 1834, decided to recall Prince Lieven from London and merely to\r\nappoint a _chargé d'affaires_ to replace him. The departure of the\r\nLievens created a great sensation, and was by many people regarded\r\nas a prelude to a complete rupture between Russia and Great Britain.\r\nThe ambassador was a commonplace person, but his wife[431] was a\r\nconspicuous figure in the fashionable and political world. Besides\r\nbeing well acquainted with most of the prominent diplomatists in\r\nEurope, she had, during her long stay in England, enjoyed the\r\nconfidence of Grey, Aberdeen and other statesmen. It may be imagined\r\nhow bitterly she deplored the necessity of exchanging a life, replete\r\nwith political interest in London, for an existence at the Court of\r\nSt. Petersburg, bereft of all the excitement in which she delighted.\r\nIt was to her influence, she considered, that Palmerston owed his\r\nappointment as Foreign Secretary, and she never forgave him for his\r\nshare in the events which led up to her husband's recall.[432]\r\n\r\nWhilst the Duke of Wellington was at the Foreign Office, during Sir\r\nRobert Peel's \"Hundred Days,\" Anglo-Russian relations perceptibly\r\nimproved. The Duke's views upon the question of the Dardanelles\r\ndiffered from those which Broglie and Palmerston had hitherto\r\nentertained. In his opinion England and France should endeavour to\r\neffect the closure of the straits to the warships of all nations. The\r\nevil arising from the passage of Russian ships from the Black Sea\r\nto the Mediterranean would not, he maintained, be diminished by the\r\nopening of the Dardanelles to the fleets of the Powers. Accordingly,\r\nhe cancelled Palmerston's secret instructions of March 10, 1834,[433]\r\nauthorizing Ponsonby, should the Porte ask for assistance against\r\nRussia, to call upon the Mediterranean squadron to enter the\r\nDardanelles. Moreover, apart from this particular question, it was\r\nnot fitting, in the eyes of the Duke, that \"the King's ambassador\r\nshould have the power of placing the country in a state of war\r\nwith another Power.\"[434] Wellington also proposed to restore the\r\ndiplomatic relations of the two countries to their normal condition\r\nby the despatch of an ambassador to St. Petersburg. But his selection\r\nof Lord Londonderry for this post was disapproved of by the House of\r\nCommons. Londonderry was an ultra-Tory who was supposed to have used\r\nunsympathetic language about the Polish insurrection, and, had he not\r\nvoluntarily declined the mission, the government would certainly have\r\nsuffered a defeat upon the question of his appointment.[435]\r\n\r\nPalmerston, upon his return to the Foreign Office in the spring\r\nof 1835, was struck by the soundness of the Duke's opinion upon\r\nthe subject of the Dardanelles.[436] Ponsonby was, in consequence,\r\ngiven no further authority over the movements of the Mediterranean\r\nsquadron. No man at this time was more absolutely persuaded of the\r\nMachiavellian character of Russian policy than Lord Ponsonby. Neither\r\nwords nor deeds could shake his opinion upon that point. Although the\r\nRussian envoy at Constantinople had co-operated with his colleagues in\r\npreventing a renewal of the struggle between the Sultan and the Pasha,\r\nthe British ambassador was none the less convinced that Nicholas was\r\nsecretly scheming to create a pretext for intervention. Again, when M.\r\nde Boutenieff assisted him in obtaining redress for the ill-treatment\r\nof a British subject at the hands of the Turkish police, he explained\r\nhis conduct by suggesting that \"the Russian minister was perhaps taken\r\nby surprise, and that those honourable feelings, which are natural\r\nto him, operated upon him.\"[437] Nor would he allow that the Cabinet\r\nof St. Petersburg was actuated either by disinterested or generous\r\nmotives when, in 1836, it consented to remit some of the indemnity due\r\nfrom Turkey and to evacuate Silistria. That fortress, he declared, was\r\nof no value to Russia, and, by relinquishing it, she \"would obtain\r\nthe advantage of making the world believe in her moderation.\"[438]\r\nBeing thus convinced that the Tsar and his advisers entertained the\r\nmost sinister designs against the integrity of the Ottoman Empire, he\r\nconcluded that a secret understanding must exist between Russia and\r\nMehemet Ali, the powerful and disaffected vassal of the Sultan.\r\n\r\nThe effect of Lord Ponsonby's alarmist despatches was to some extent\r\ncounteracted by the more statesmanlike reports of Lord Durham, his\r\nnephew by marriage. The Duke of Wellington's intention to send an\r\nambassador of St. Petersburg had enabled the Whigs, upon their return\r\nto power, to despatch Lord Durham in that capacity to the Russian\r\ncapital. Durham, during the two years he was in Russia, travelled\r\nthrough the southern provinces and made an exhaustive study of the\r\nresources of the country. The result of his observations and enquiries\r\nconvinced him that Russia's power for offensive war had been greatly\r\nexaggerated. Furthermore, he was persuaded that the Tsar Nicholas\r\nand almost all intelligent Russians were sincerely desirous of\r\nestablishing a good understanding with England, and had altogether\r\nabandoned the idea of acquiring Constantinople. In short, he saw no\r\nreason why \"a rival and an enemy should not be converted into a friend\r\nand an ally.\"[439]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Palmerston and Broglie had been quietly endeavouring to\r\ninduce Austria to join with France and Great Britain in guaranteeing\r\nthe integrity of Turkey. But Metternich, having contracted the\r\nsecret agreement with Russia[440] for the maintenance of the Ottoman\r\nEmpire, was not disposed to incur the Tsar's displeasure by entering\r\ninto a second compact. Broglie, finding that his advances met with\r\nno response, suggested that France and England should separately\r\nconclude a treaty for the object which both their governments had at\r\nheart and invite Austria to adhere to it. Palmerston[441] acquiesced\r\nin this plan, but was unable to obtain the assent of his colleagues\r\nto its execution. Before any further discussion of the subject could\r\ntake place Broglie fell, and the Presidency of the Council and the\r\ndirection of Foreign Affairs passed into the hands of M. Thiers.\r\nThe new minister professed to be as anxious as his predecessor to\r\npreserve the integrity of the Ottoman Empire, but it was apparent, at\r\nonce, that his first political object, to which all other questions\r\nof European diplomacy would for the present be subordinated, was the\r\nnegotiation of a marriage between the Duc d'Orléans and an Austrian\r\nArchduchess.[442]\r\n\r\nWith the downfall of the Duc de Broglie the harmony, which had\r\nhitherto characterized French and British relations, began to\r\ndiminish. Both Whigs and Tories had scrupulously abstained\r\nfrom raising the delicate question of the French occupation of\r\nAlgiers.[443] Broglie and the _Doctrinaires_ were opposed to the\r\npermanent retention of the colony, and a considerable section of the\r\nChamber looked upon it as a useless and expensive encumbrance. M.\r\nThiers, however, thought otherwise. He was in favour of \"nationalizing\r\nthe Arabs\"--an expression which Mr. Aston[444] interpreted to mean\r\nthat he was contemplating their extermination. No sooner was he in\r\noffice than he began to prepare an expedition against the Bey of\r\nConstantine, with whom the French authorities had a long-standing\r\ndispute. At the same time, whilst protesting that he had no thought of\r\nextending French domination over either Tunis or Tripoli, he refused\r\nto recognize the sovereignty of the Sultan over those regencies. To\r\nsupport this policy he sent Admiral Hugon to Tunis to oppose, by force\r\nif necessary, the entry of the Ottoman squadron into the bay. \"I\r\nreally believe,\" privately wrote the British _chargé d'affaires_ to\r\nLord Palmerston, \"that in order to gain popularity he wishes for a war\r\nwith Turkey, provided he could make it appear that it was undertaken\r\nto protect French interests.\"[445]\r\n\r\nWhilst M. Thiers thus set himself to consolidate the French rule over\r\nAlgeria a secret negotiation was initiated, at Constantinople and at\r\nCairo, for the purpose of establishing, under the guarantee of the\r\nFrench government, the relations of the Sultan and the Pasha of Egypt\r\nupon a more secure foundation. Campbell appears to have received\r\nthe first intelligence of what was taking place from his Austrian\r\ncolleague. The news caused him to pay a visit to M. Ferdinand de\r\nLesseps,[446] who, in the absence of M. Mimaut, was acting as French\r\nconsul-general. Lesseps was in a great state of indignation, and in\r\nhis wrath was inclined to be communicative. M. Thiers, he confided\r\nto Campbell, before he left Paris, had told him that an important\r\nnegotiation was in progress, but that he would not discuss it with\r\nhim as, upon his arrival at Alexandria, he could learn all about it\r\nfrom a perusal of the documents at the consulate. Mimaut, however,\r\nhad carefully removed every paper relating to the affair, and he was,\r\nin consequence, in complete ignorance of all that had passed. He had\r\nendeavoured, he added ingenuously, to make Boghos Bey believe that\r\nhe was acquainted with the transaction, but the astute secretary of\r\nthe Pasha had discovered the true state of the case and had promptly\r\nchanged the conversation.[447]\r\n\r\nSoon after Campbell's interview with Lesseps, on December 11, 1836,\r\nSarim Effendi, who was described by Mehemet Ali as a confidential\r\nagent of the Sultan, arrived at Alexandria. Ostensibly his mission was\r\nconcerned with questions of arrears of tribute. In reality, however,\r\nhe appears to have been empowered to propose some repartition of\r\nterritory. The statements upon the subject which Campbell succeeded\r\nin extracting from Mehemet Ali were conflicting. At one time he told\r\nthe British consul that the Sultan was willing to invest him with the\r\nhereditary government of Egypt and the Pashalic of Acre, whilst, on\r\nanother occasion, he asserted that the hereditary tenure of all the\r\nterritories which he actually occupied had been offered to him, on\r\ncondition that he would undertake to reduce his army.[448] In Paris\r\nLord Granville was unable to obtain any information about this affair.\r\nIn answer to his enquiries he was told that Roussin had, \"with the\r\nobject of saving the dignity of the Sultan, held out to the Pasha\r\nthe prospect of obtaining for his son the reversion of his Syrian\r\npossessions, in return for the abandonment of the other territories\r\nwhich he occupied.\" But he was assured that the admiral had acted\r\nwithout instructions from his government, which had, on the contrary,\r\n\"discountenanced his proceedings.\"[449]\r\n\r\nIf Mahmud really empowered Sarim Effendi to make substantial\r\nconcessions to the Pasha, such conduct on his part is altogether\r\ninconsistent with the sentiments of implacable hostility which he had\r\nconstantly entertained towards his powerful vassal. In the spring of\r\n1836 he had shown a strong disposition to renew the struggle, and\r\nhad sent a secret agent to London to solicit help. His appeal was\r\nrejected, but Palmerston intimated that the British government was\r\nconstrained to urge him to keep the peace from fear that his military\r\nresources would be unequal to the contest, rather than from any desire\r\nto see the _status quo_ in Syria maintained.[450] Finding that no\r\nassistance would be forthcoming from England, Mahmud may have listened\r\nto the advice of the French government to make further concessions\r\nto Mehemet Ali, in order to put an end to the armed peace which was\r\ndraining his depleted treasury. But the conditions, whatever they\r\nmay have been, which were proposed to the Pasha were not accepted.\r\nNevertheless, the negotiation, although it led to no direct results,\r\nhad an important influence upon the march of events. It disclosed to\r\nMehemet Ali that France and England were pursuing different objects in\r\nthe East, and gave him grounds for hoping that he need no longer fear\r\na combination of the two naval Powers against him.\r\n\r\nBut, although the Sultan may have been disappointed and annoyed at\r\nthe refusal of Great Britain to assist him actively, he could derive\r\ncomfort from the knowledge that the power of Mehemet Ali was regarded\r\nwith misgivings in England. Ponsonby's influence at the Porte grew\r\nin proportion as it became more and more evident that his government\r\ndisapproved of the Egyptian occupation of Syria, and was prepared\r\nto uphold the sovereignty of Turkey over Tunis and to resist French\r\nencroachments. On the other hand, the Russian ambassador, who declared\r\nunceasingly that under no circumstances must the _status quo_, as\r\nestablished by the Convention of Kiutayeh, be disturbed, found his\r\nauthority diminish. Early in 1836, shortly before the arrival in\r\nEngland of the Sultan's secret agent, Palmerston had despatched\r\nGeneral Chrzanowski, an able and experienced Polish officer, to\r\nAsia Minor. He had served in the Turkish campaign of 1828-1829, and\r\nwas, Palmerston considered,[451] \"just the sort of man to be of the\r\ngreatest use to Reshid Pasha.\"[452] But as the Russians, by whom he\r\nwas looked upon as a deserter, would greatly resent his employment,\r\nhe was instructed to avoid Constantinople, and to proceed direct to\r\nSmyrna. He would never appear to have been given a command or to\r\nhave been employed officially by the Sultan, who probably scarcely\r\nventured to defy his powerful neighbour so openly. He was allowed,\r\nhowever, to travel about Asia Minor, and to study the strategical\r\nsituation. He was thus enabled to furnish Palmerston with excellent\r\nmilitary advice, in return for the salary which Lord Ponsonby\r\nwas instructed to pay him, from the moment of his arrival in the\r\nEast.[453] Several Prussian officers, among them a certain Major von\r\nMoltke, destined to become very famous, were at this time serving with\r\nthe Turkish army, to the re-organization of which, in preparation for\r\nthe coming struggle, Palmerston unceasingly urged the Sultan to devote\r\nhis whole attention.\r\n\r\nWhilst instructing Ponsonby to impress upon the Turkish ministers\r\nthe necessity of increasing the efficiency of the army, Palmerston\r\nwas intent on creating embarrassments for Mehemet Ali. The economic\r\nsystem, which he had established in Egypt, and which he was imposing\r\nupon Syria, presented an excellent field for hostile criticism. By\r\noften very equivocal methods the Pasha had gradually expropriated the\r\nformer freeholders, and had converted them into his own tenants. He\r\nwould then buy at a fixed rate their produce, and thus, before long,\r\nthe sale of almost all articles of prime necessity became a monopoly\r\nof the State. At first his system appeared to work well, but, when\r\nhe began to pile up his armaments, he met the increased expenditure\r\nwhich they entailed by reducing the price, which he had hitherto paid\r\nto the unfortunate occupiers of the soil. In order to compensate\r\nthemselves these people were necessarily compelled to raise the\r\nprice of all articles which the government did not take from them.\r\nIn 1838 Colonel Campbell computed that, as the result of the Pasha's\r\nadministration, articles of ordinary consumption in Egypt were from\r\nsix to ten times dearer than they had been under the rule of the\r\nMamelukes. Moreover, Mehemet Ali, ever since the year 1816, had been\r\nbusily endeavouring to convert Egypt into a manufacturing country.\r\nWith this object he had imported at great expense skilled workmen and\r\nmachinery from France and England. The native labour required was\r\nobtained in the same manner as the army was recruited. Men, women and\r\nchildren were impressed and compelled to work in the factories. But by\r\ntheir unskilfulness they injured the machinery, nor did the articles\r\nwhich they turned out pay the cost of manufacture. The result of this\r\nexperiment was that some 30,000 peasants, who might with advantage\r\nhave been engaged in agriculture, were forced to labour unprofitably\r\nin the factories of the government. The Pasha, however, was too\r\nignorant of the most elementary principles of political economy to\r\nunderstand the folly of these proceedings, in which he was encouraged\r\nto persevere by the foreign merchants, who sold him machinery or who\r\nbought his cotton and his indigo upon very advantageous terms.[454]\r\n\r\nThe British government had always been desirous to put an end to the\r\nold system of _capitulations_,[455] and to negotiate a new commercial\r\ntreaty with the Porte. But as many influential persons in Turkey were\r\ninterested in the preservation of existing abuses, the proposals of\r\nsuccessive ambassadors had constantly been eluded. At the beginning\r\nof 1838, however, Palmerston directed Ponsonby to bring the matter\r\nforward again, and to lay great stress upon the prejudicial effect\r\nwhich the abolition of monopolies throughout the Ottoman Empire would\r\nnot fail to have upon the personal position of Mehemet Ali.[456] This\r\nargument attained the desired result. Mahmud quickly resolved that\r\nno vested interests should be allowed to interfere with a commercial\r\narrangement, which must either seriously embarrass Mehemet Ali or,\r\nshould he refuse to adhere to it, bring him into conflict with Great\r\nBritain. The Sultan's consent having been obtained, Ponsonby entrusted\r\nto Henry Bulwer the negotiation which was brought to a satisfactory\r\nconclusion on August 19, 1838.[457]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, it had not escaped the vigilance of the Indian\r\ngovernment that the protracted resistance of the Wahabites was\r\nweakening, and that Mehemet Ali was upon the point of making\r\nhimself master of the whole of Arabia. The importance of Aden as\r\nan intermediate coaling station between Bombay and Suez had been\r\nrealized, and it happened, most opportunely, that a quarrel[458]\r\nbetween the ruler of that port and the East India Company enabled the\r\nGovernor-General to take action at the very moment when the absorption\r\nof the Yemen by the Pasha was imminent.[459] The management of the\r\naffair was confided to Captain Haines of the Bombay navy, who, early\r\nin 1838, was able to inform Ibrahim that the Sultan of Aden had ceded\r\nthe port to the East India Company \"_par simple motif d'amitié et de\r\nson cosentement_.\"[460] Nevertheless, the expedition sent from India\r\nto take possession of the place encountered, on January 16, 1839, a\r\nfierce resistance which was only overcome after a sharp engagement.\r\nPalmerston, upon receipt of the news of its cession, at once directed\r\nCampbell to warn Mehemet Ali that any movement of his troops against\r\nAden would be treated as an attack upon a British possession. The\r\nPasha, although unable wholly to conceal his chagrin, accepted the\r\nsituation with a good grace.[461]\r\n\r\nEver since the beginning of the year 1838, great military preparations\r\nhad been in progress both in Egypt and Syria. The consuls, had in\r\nconsequence, been instructed to inquire of Mehemet Ali the reason of\r\nhis armaments. It was whilst they were engaged in warning him that any\r\naggression upon the Sultan would bring down upon him the vengeance of\r\nthe Powers that the news arrived of the submission of Nejd, the great\r\ncentral district of Arabia, extending from Medina and Mecca to the\r\nPersian Gulf.[462] It was impossible to calculate what might result\r\nfrom the enhanced prestige which he had thus acquired in the eyes of\r\nthe faithful. The immediate effect was seen, a few days later, when\r\nhe sent for the consuls and announced to each of them separately his\r\nunalterable resolution to proclaim his independence. \"The interests of\r\nhis family,\" he declared to Campbell, \"imperiously called upon him to\r\nfix their future state, and it was _les larmes aux yeux et le coeur\r\nserré_ that he had taken his present resolution.\" Nevertheless, he\r\nwould wait a reasonable time in the full persuasion that the British\r\ngovernment would take such steps as would permit of an amicable and\r\nsatisfactory settlement.[463]\r\n\r\nThe Cabinets of the Powers were not greatly disturbed by the Pasha's\r\nthreats. Palmerston alone showed any anxiety to arrange the military\r\nmeasures which might be put into force against Mehemet Ali, should he\r\nproceed to carry out his declared intentions.[464] But it was soon\r\nevident that the Pasha had no desire to bring on a crisis. Although he\r\ncontinued to impress upon the consuls that he was fully as determined\r\nas ever to obtain for his children the succession of the countries\r\nwhich he governed, he at the same time announced his intention of\r\nproceeding to Upper Egypt to inspect his gold mines. Furthermore,\r\nhe duly transmitted his yearly tribute to the Sultan. Nevertheless,\r\nhis military preparations were not relaxed and reinforcements were\r\ncontinuously despatched to Ibrahim in Syria. It was clear that he\r\nhad no intention of affording the Powers a pretext for taking active\r\nmeasures against him, but hoped, by keeping them and the Porte in a\r\nconstant state of apprehension, to weary them into conceding him some\r\nof his demands.[465] In pursuance of this astute policy he accepted\r\nthe British commercial treaty with the utmost unconcern. He was\r\nconfident, he assured Campbell, that he could derive a larger revenue\r\nfrom duties on exports and imports than he had ever obtained under\r\nhis system of monopolies.[466] M. Molé, on the other hand, testified\r\nhis surprise and annoyance at the success which had attended Lord\r\nPonsonby's negotiations. He was greatly afraid, he told Granville,\r\nthat Mehemet Ali would now be provoked into an immediate declaration\r\nof independence. But, upon learning that the Pasha had announced his\r\nintention of adhering to the terms of the British treaty, he promptly\r\ninstructed Roussin to conclude, on behalf of France, a similar\r\narrangement with the Porte.[467]\r\n\r\nWhilst the aims and ambitions of Mehemet Ali were once more\r\nattracting the attention of the Powers, Anglo-Russian relations again\r\nassumed a threatening aspect. Both the British and Indian governments\r\nhad, for some time past, been disturbed by the ascendency which Russia\r\nwas acquiring over the Court of Teheran, and by the intrigues of her\r\nagents in Afghanistan. Encouraged by Count Simonitch, the Russian\r\nenvoy, the Shah, who entertained pretensions to the sovereignty of\r\nAfghanistan, at the close of the year 1837, marched against Herat.\r\nBefore the siege had been long in progress both the British and\r\nRussian ministers arrived upon the scene--the one to endeavour to\r\nbring about a cessation of hostilities, and the other to direct the\r\noperations of the Persian army. Whilst Macneil and Simonitch thus\r\nstrove for supremacy in the camp of Mohammad, Eldred Pottinger, a\r\nsubaltern of the Indian army, who had reached Herat disguised as a\r\nhorse-dealer, stimulated by his example the courage of the garrison.\r\nAt the same time Captain Witkewitch, a secret agent of Count\r\nSimonitch, arrived at Cabul, for the purpose of drawing Dost Mohammad\r\ninto the Russo-Persian alliance and of counteracting the influence of\r\nAlexander Burnes, who, like his Russian rival, was in Afghanistan upon\r\na mission which was described as commercial. The idea of a Russian\r\nagent established at Cabul, free to intrigue with Ranjit Singh, the\r\nMaharajah of Lahore, and supported by the whole weight of Mohammedan\r\nPersia, seriously alarmed Lord Auckland, the Governor-General.[468]\r\nTo combat this danger he conceived the fatal plan of sending an\r\nAnglo-Indian army into Afghanistan to overthrow the Barakzai dynasty,\r\nand to set up in the place of Dost Mohammad an exiled Sadozai prince,\r\na pensioner of the Indian government.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of the Russian agents in Persia and Afghanistan was made\r\nthe subject of a note which, on October 26, 1838, Clanricarde,\r\nthe British ambassador at St. Petersburg, was directed to deliver\r\nto Count Nesselrode. The Russian Chancellor, whilst deprecating\r\nthe construction placed by Palmerston on some of Count Simonitch's\r\nactions, admitted that he had exceeded his instructions and undertook\r\nto recall him.[469] This promise was duly carried out. Consequently,\r\nwhen Witkewitch arrived at St. Petersburg he was coldly informed\r\nthat he must forthwith return to his post at Orenburg. In despair at\r\nfinding that the negotiations, which he had conducted so skilfully,\r\nwere to be disavowed, the unfortunate man blew out his brains.[470]\r\nOnly a little more than two years later Burnes, his rival, perished at\r\nCabul at the hands of an infuriated mob.\r\n\r\nThe assurances and explanations of Count Nesselrode were accepted as\r\nsatisfactory by Lord Palmerston. The visit of the Tsarewitch, the\r\nfuture Alexander II., to London, in the spring of 1839, contributed\r\nstill further to restore harmonious relations. Nevertheless, the\r\ngeneral situation which confronted Palmerston was disquieting.\r\nRussia, which by means of the Treaty of Unkiar-Skelessi had assumed\r\nthe exclusive protectorship of Turkey, now appeared to exercise a\r\ndangerous ascendency over the Court of Persia. Although the Shah\r\nhad been compelled to raise the siege of Herat, and although the\r\nproceedings of Simonitch and Witkewitch had been disavowed, there was\r\nroom for grave anxiety. Distant as was the frontier line of the Sutlej\r\nfrom the most advanced Cossack posts, the presence of Russian agents\r\nin the intervening States foreboded trouble. At Lahore, Hyderabad and\r\nCabul, the appearance of a new power in Central Asia could not fail\r\nto be eagerly discussed.\r\n\r\nBut it was not alone the advance of Russia beyond the Caspian which\r\ngave those responsible for the safety of British India cause for\r\nuneasy reflection. At this time, when the introduction of steam as a\r\nmeans of transport was making the question of rapid communication a\r\nmatter of the first importance, Mehemet Ali was building up an Arab\r\nEmpire which already extended from Khartum to the Taurus mountains\r\nand the Persian Gulf. Whether in the future the Indian mail would be\r\ncarried over the Isthmus of Suez, or whether Colonel Chesney should\r\nsucceed in establishing steam communication by way of the Euphrates,\r\nthe ruler of Egypt was master of either route. Nor did he stand\r\nalone. Whilst busily engaged in strengthening her own position as\r\na Mediterranean power, England's most formidable naval rival was\r\nshowing a marked disposition to befriend him. In Syria France was\r\nthe acknowledged protector of the Catholics, and her influence was\r\nreported to have increased of late years.[471] From Algiers she was\r\nextending her grasp over the whole north coast of Africa, whilst in\r\nSpain she was striving to re-establish that predominating influence\r\nwhich she had formerly exercised. It seemed possible that France, in\r\nalliance with Spain and Mehemet Ali, might yet be enabled to realize\r\nNapoleon's dream of converting the Mediterranean into a \"French lake.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Mehemet Ali had announced his intention of shaking off his\r\nallegiance, Mahmud had seemed to defer to the pacific counsels of the\r\nPowers, and had refrained from ordering his troops in Asia Minor to\r\ninvade Syria. But, before the spring of 1839, it was clear that he\r\nwas resolved to appeal to arms, and that all the efforts of diplomacy\r\nto prevent a renewal of the conflict would be fruitless. It was not\r\nalone his bitter hatred of his rebellious vassal which prompted the\r\nSultan to disregard the advice of the ambassadors at Constantinople.\r\nHis sole claim to the Khalifate rested upon the protection of Mecca,\r\nand, inasmuch as Mehemet Ali was in possession of the Holy Cities,\r\nwere he to declare himself independent, Mahmud must forfeit his\r\nright to command the temporal obedience of Mohammedans. Already\r\nConstantinople was seething with disaffection, and he is said to have\r\nbeen aware that a plot had been formed to depose him and to enthrone\r\nhis son, under the guardianship of Mehemet Ali.[472]\r\n\r\nMahmud was dying from a complication of disorders, but he gave his\r\nwhole expiring strength to his military preparations. Men, horses\r\nand guns were hurried across the Bosphorus and forwarded to Hafiz\r\nPasha in Asia Minor. Moltke with his plane-table was busily engaged\r\nin exploring the country up to Nezib, \"a small town hidden among the\r\nolive trees close against the Syrian frontier.\"[473] At the news\r\nthat the Porte was bent upon war, Mehemet Ali, curtailing his visit\r\nto Khartum, hastily returned to Cairo, whilst at Constantinople\r\nthe ambassadors made a last endeavour to dissuade the Sultan from\r\ndisturbing the peace.[474] But Mahmud was not to be diverted from his\r\nobject, and in Paris, on May 23, 1839, it was known that Hafiz Pasha\r\nhad crossed the Euphrates and that hostilities were about to begin.\r\n\r\nFrench historians have generally imputed duplicity to the British\r\ngovernment in this affair. Palmerston, they say, whilst pretending\r\nthat he was anxious to dissuade the Sultan from war, was in point\r\nof fact allowing Lord Ponsonby, his agent at Constantinople, to\r\nencourage the Turkish ministers to break the peace. Ponsonby was\r\nunquestionably opposed to the policy of maintaining the _status quo_\r\nin Syria. In his opinion Mehemet Ali was the sore which was sapping\r\nthe strength of the Ottoman Empire, and, seeing that it was a British\r\ninterest that Turkey should be in a condition to resist Russia, he\r\nheld that England should assist the Sultan to crush his too-powerful\r\nvassal.[475] It is undeniable that Palmerston allowed him a liberty\r\nof action and of language which he would not have tolerated in any\r\nother ambassador. There can be no doubt, moreover, that he regarded\r\nthe Egyptian question in very much the same light as Ponsonby. But\r\nhe differed from him in one very important particular, inasmuch as\r\nhe considered that the moment had not yet come when Mahmud could,\r\nwith a reasonable chance of success, try conclusions with the Pasha.\r\nFrance, he was well aware, would never join in an attack upon Mehemet\r\nAli. Indeed, it was rather a question whether she would not openly\r\nespouse his cause. The possibility of a combination between Russia and\r\nFrance could not be dismissed as a development outside the range of\r\npractical politics.[476] Hitherto, Nicholas' dislike of Louis Philippe\r\nhad rendered the chance of such a contingency very remote. But, were\r\nEngland to adopt a separate policy in the east, it was improbable that\r\nthe Tsar would allow his personal animosity to stand in the way of an\r\nalliance, which he might consider would serve the best interests of\r\nhis Empire. Accordingly, when, at the close of the year 1838, Reshid\r\nPasha, the _Reis-Effendi_, arrived upon a special mission to London,\r\nhe discovered, to his disappointment, that Palmerston was not prepared\r\nto hold out any hopes that the British government would join in an\r\nattack upon Mehemet Ali. Only, Palmerston explained, in the event of\r\nthe Pasha beginning hostilities, could England furnish the Sultan with\r\nnaval assistance. Mahmud being intent upon war, a purely defensive\r\nalliance could be of no service to him, and was declined.[477] If the\r\nbellicose policy of the Sultan had received any encouragement from\r\nLord Ponsonby, Reshid's conferences at the Foreign Office in London\r\nmust have made it clear that the ambassador had been using language\r\nwhich he had no authority to employ. When, therefore, the Sultan\r\nordered Hafiz Pasha to advance, he was perfectly aware that he was\r\nacting in opposition to the wishes of the British government, which\r\ndid not believe that he had an army capable of defeating Ibrahim's\r\nArab and Egyptian troops.\r\n\r\nDirectly it was known that the Turkish army had been set in motion\r\nand that all hope of maintaining the peace must be abandoned, the\r\nSoult Cabinet asked the Chamber for a credit of ten million francs.\r\nThe sum demanded was accorded by an overwhelming majority and, in\r\nthe debates which followed, the deputies were enabled to declare\r\ntheir views upon the eastern question. The sympathies of the majority\r\nwere plainly on the side of Mehemet Ali, and ministers were given\r\nclearly to understand, by the long succession of orators who in turn\r\nascended the tribune, that with the large sum which had been placed at\r\ntheir disposal they must do something both great and glorious.[478]\r\nSoult, in the meanwhile, had despatched two officers, the one to\r\nConstantinople and the other to Alexandria, with instructions to\r\nproceed, after conferring with Admiral Roussin and M. Cochelet, to\r\nthe headquarters of the two armies, in order to endeavour to bring\r\nabout a suspension of hostilities. The friendly feelings towards\r\nEngland entertained by Marshal Soult, and the better understanding\r\nwith regard to Spanish affairs between the French and English\r\ngovernments, which followed his assumption of office, have already\r\nbeen mentioned. Their co-operation in the eastern question was no less\r\ncordial. \"We are in complete accord,\" said Palmerston to Bourqueney,\r\nthe French _chargé d'affaires_ in London; \"our communications are not\r\nthose of one government with another but of two colleagues in the\r\nsame Cabinet.\"[479] It was decided that both the French and British\r\nfleets should proceed to the Levant, and that the admirals should be\r\ninstructed to do all in their power to induce the opposing generals\r\nto suspend hostilities. Both Soult and Palmerston, however, were\r\nagreed that the great danger in the situation lay in the possibility\r\nthat Nicholas might avail himself of the outbreak of war for invading\r\nTurkey, under the plea that Constantinople must be protected against\r\nIbrahim. They, accordingly, resolved to intimate to the Porte that, in\r\nthe event of Russian aid being invoked, or of a Russian fleet entering\r\nthe Bosphorus, permission should be given to the French and British\r\nsquadrons to pass through the Dardanelles into the Sea of Marmora.[480]\r\n\r\nMehemet Ali, when the news arrived that the Turks had crossed the\r\nEuphrates, displayed the greatest self-restraint. In his heart he\r\nwas, doubtless, eager for the fray, but he was determined that the\r\nresponsibility for the outbreak of the war should rest with the\r\nSultan. Accordingly, he delivered a written communication to the\r\nrepresentatives of the Powers, in which he undertook to withdraw\r\nhis troops to Damascus, provided the Turkish army would recross\r\nthe river.[481] It was only on June 10, upon receipt of a report\r\nfrom Ibrahim that his cavalry had been attacked within the Egyptian\r\nfrontier, that he directed him to assume the offensive.[482] But three\r\ndays after these orders had been despatched Captain Caillier, the\r\nofficer sent off by Marshal Soult, arrived at Alexandria. He was the\r\nbearer of despatches from the Marshal to M. Cochelet, instructing him\r\nto declare to Mehemet Ali that the Powers were taking steps to settle\r\nthe eastern question, and that they must insist upon the immediate\r\nwithdrawal of the Egyptian army within the boundaries of Syria. The\r\nPasha, after some little hesitation, consented to write to his son\r\nenjoining him not to pursue the Turks beyond the frontiers of Syria\r\nand to halt wherever Caillier might come up with him.[483] But before\r\nMarshal Soult's emissary could reach Ibrahim's headquarters that\r\ngeneral had completely defeated the Turks, on June 24, 1839, in a\r\ngreat battle near Nezib.\r\n\r\nBefore the news of this disaster could reach Constantinople Mahmud was\r\ndead, and when, shortly afterwards, the intelligence of the complete\r\ndefeat of Hafiz Pasha was brought to the Turkish ministers, they kept\r\nthe matter strictly secret. Abd-ul-Mejid, the sixteen-year-old son of\r\nthe deceased Mahmud, was proclaimed Sultan, and the ambassadors of\r\nthe Powers were invited to a conference on July 3. On this occasion\r\nNourri-Effendi, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, announced that the\r\nPorte had no reason to suppose that any engagement had yet taken\r\nplace between the two armies. Nevertheless, the Sultan purposed to\r\nsend \"one of the eminent men of his Court\" to offer Mehemet Ali a\r\nfull pardon for the past and to assure him of his favour in the\r\nfuture. Furthermore, he was prepared to confer upon him the hereditary\r\ngovernment of Egypt, provided he would abandon Syria and the other\r\nterritories over which he now exercised his dominion. Pending the\r\nresult of this negotiation orders had been sent to Hafiz Pasha to\r\nsuspend hostilities.[484]\r\n\r\nIt was not until July 8 that the true facts were generally known\r\nin Constantinople, and, on the evening of that day, Lord Ponsonby\r\nwas informed by the French ambassador of a fresh disaster. Admiral\r\nLalande, who with a small French squadron was lying at the entrance\r\nto the Dardanelles, reported that the _Capudan Pasha_ had sailed away\r\nwith, he believed, the intention of delivering up his fleet to Mehemet\r\nAli. Osman Bey, the second in command of the Turkish squadron, had had\r\nan interview with the French admiral,[485] and had declared that the\r\nSultan had been murdered by Halil and Hosrew Pasha, both of whom were\r\nin league with the Russians. Under these circumstances the _Capudan\r\nPasha_ determined to place his ships in safety. On this pretext he\r\nproceeded with all speed to Alexandria, where he delivered up to the\r\nPasha his whole fleet, consisting of twenty-one sail, of which eight\r\nwere of the line.\r\n\r\nThe indifference with which Admiral Lalande had heard of the\r\ntreacherous intentions of the _Capudan Pasha_, and the apathy\r\nwhich had characterized his proceedings, could not fail to attract\r\nattention. Marshal Boult himself, in discussing the surrender of\r\nthe Turkish fleet with Lord Granville, was forced to admit that\r\nLalande's conduct appeared to him inexplicable.[486] In the course\r\nof the next few months, however, further light was thrown upon the\r\nmatter. An Armenian, a certain Avedick, the confidential _dragoman_\r\nof the _Capudan Pasha_, was smuggled out of Alexandria on board a\r\nBritish ship. This man, when he arrived at Constantinople, agreed to\r\ndisclose all he knew to Reshid Pasha. According to his statement,\r\nAdmiral Lalande, accompanied by the Prince de Joinville, came on\r\nboard the Turkish flagship, and held a consultation with Osman,\r\nthe _Reala Bey_,[487] who seems to have been the evil genius of\r\nthe _Capudan Pasha_. On learning of his intention to proceed to\r\nAlexandria, the French officers, far from attempting to detain him,\r\napplauded his resolution, bidding him only to be careful to avoid\r\nH.M.S. _Vanguard_, which was in Besika Bay. Ponsonby, in forwarding\r\nthe papers connected with this affair, emitted the opinion that,\r\nalthough many circumstances appeared to confirm the truth of the\r\n_dragoman's_ story, \"he could not feel it to be true of an honourable\r\nman like Admiral Lalande.\"[488] Palmerston either adopted this view,\r\nor more probably, deemed it impossible to base a formal representation\r\nto the French government upon Avedick's unsupported statement. But\r\nafter the abdication and death of his father, the Prince de Joinville\r\nsaw fit to publish, under an assumed name in the _Revue des Deux\r\nMondes_;[489] an account of these transactions which confirmed the\r\n_dragoman's_ allegations in every particular. Throughout the French\r\nfleet there was, says His Royal Highness, a bitter hatred of England\r\nand an intense desire to avenge former defeats. The Pasha of Egypt\r\nwas regarded as the ally of France in a struggle, which every man\r\nhoped and believed, would take place in the near future. Admiral\r\nLalande was, therefore, clearly justified in encouraging the _Capudan\r\nPasha_ to surrender his fleet to Mehemet Ali. Although thirteen years\r\nhad elapsed since the events referred to in this article had taken\r\nplace, the Prince evidently experienced the greatest satisfaction\r\nin remembering that Captain Walker, and the other British naval\r\ninstructors of the Ottoman fleet, had been carried off to Alexandria\r\non ships which were to be handed over to England's enemy, the Pasha of\r\nEgypt.\r\n\r\nThese successive disasters, Lord Palmerston maintained, should make no\r\ndifference in the policy of the Powers. On the contrary, the battle\r\nof Nezib had made it the more imperative that steps should be taken\r\nto check the progress of the victorious Ibrahim.[490] Metternich\r\nheld the same opinion. Russia, however, appeared disposed to adopt\r\na different view of the situation. In 1838, when Mehemet Ali was\r\nthreatening to proclaim his independence, she had refused to acquiesce\r\nin Palmerston's proposal that the Turco-Egyptian question should be\r\nsubmitted to a conference of the Powers.[491] But in the following\r\nspring, when it was plain that the Sultan was resolved to embark\r\nupon war, she had not appeared disinclined to entertain Metternich's\r\nsuggestion that the seat of the negotiations should be established at\r\nVienna. \"Each Cabinet,\" Metternich proposed, \"might send its opinion\r\nto its representatives at Vienna, leaving a certain latitude for\r\ndiscussion, and from a comparison of the five opinions, one should\r\nbe sought in which all might coincide.\"[492] By this arrangement much\r\ndelay would be obviated, and the same advantages could be obtained as\r\nby the summoning of the conference, to which Nicholas had objected.\r\nBut at the news that, as a consequence of the death of Mahmud and of\r\nthe defeat sustained by the Turkish arms at Nezib, the Porte purposed\r\nto open a direct negotiation with the Pasha, the Cabinet of St.\r\nPetersburg once more evinced a strong disinclination to assent to the\r\nplan of establishing a European concert for the settlement of the\r\neastern question.[493] The disposition which Nicholas thus manifested\r\nto diverge from the policy advocated by Great Britain and Austria, was\r\nhastily seized by France as an opportunity for isolating Russia. The\r\nSoult Cabinet, accordingly, insisted upon the necessity of counselling\r\nthe Porte to avoid any precipitate action, and only to treat with\r\nMehemet Ali through the intermediary of the Powers.[494] Palmerston,\r\nas may be supposed, lost no time in expressing to the Marshal the\r\nsatisfaction which he derived from seeing that he was animated by\r\nsentiments coinciding so completely with his own.[495]\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile Akiff-Effendi, the Turkish envoy, sent to treat\r\nwith Mehemet Ali, had returned to Constantinople, after a fruitless\r\nmission to Cairo. The Pasha had protested his loyalty to the young\r\nSultan, but he had none the less received the _Capudan Pasha_ and\r\nhis officers with open arms and clearly meant to retain the Ottoman\r\nfleet. Moreover, he had declared emphatically that he must be invested\r\nwith the hereditary government of both Syria and Egypt, and had\r\nexpressed indignation that his old enemy Hosrew Pasha, the Grand\r\nVizier, had not been dismissed. He had, however, undertaken that, for\r\nthe present, Ibrahim should not advance into Asia Minor.[496] It was\r\nclear to the ambassadors at Constantinople that the Porte, if left\r\nto itself, would consent to all the Pasha's demands. \"I consider the\r\nOttoman Empire to be delivered over to Mehemet Ali,\" wrote Ponsonby\r\non July 26.[497] But, on the following day, Baron Stürmer received\r\ndespatches from Vienna.[498] Metternich had either foreseen, or had\r\nobtained early information, that the Turkish ministers would make\r\nfurther concessions, and he, accordingly, informed the _Internuncio_\r\nthat the five Powers were determined to resist the pretensions of\r\nMehemet Ali, and directed him to urge his colleagues to unite with him\r\nin representing to the Porte the necessity of allowing the conditions\r\nof peace to be settled by the Powers. Lord Beauvale[499] and M. de\r\nSainte-Aulaire had, it is said, at Metternich's request, written in\r\nthe same strain to Ponsonby and to Roussin.[500] A meeting of the\r\nrepresentatives of the five Powers was immediately convened and a note\r\nwas drawn up, informing the Porte \"that agreement among the five Great\r\nPowers, on the question of the East, was secured,\" and inviting it to\r\nsuspend any definitive resolution without their concurrence. M. de\r\nBoutenieff, the Russian minister, appears to have made no difficulty\r\nabout affixing his signature to this document, which was to be known\r\nas the _collective note of July_ 27, 1839. When it was presented to\r\nthem, the Turkish ministers expressed the utmost gratitude, and\r\npromised to suspend all negotiations and to inform Mehemet Ali that\r\nthe affair was now in the hands of the five Powers.[501]\r\n\r\nThe news that the _collective note_ had been delivered, and that it\r\nhad been accepted by the Porte in the desired spirit, afforded the\r\nkeenest satisfaction at Vienna and in London. Palmerston, agreeing\r\nwith Ponsonby, perceived that it had destroyed the Treaty of\r\nUnkiar-Skelessi, and that the days of Russia's exclusive protectorship\r\nover Turkey were at an end. One of the chief objects of his eastern\r\npolicy had thus been attained, and he could devote his whole attention\r\nto the other--the curtailment of the power of Mehemet Ali. In Paris,\r\non the other hand, the situation created by the _collective note_\r\nawoke serious misgivings. Since the battle of Nezib, French enthusiasm\r\nfor Mehemet Ali had increased alarmingly. \"Men,\" wrote Véron,[502]\r\n\"defended the claims of the Pasha with the same fervour as, in 1828,\r\nthey had espoused the cause of Greek independence.\" Ministers, under\r\nthese circumstances, could only reflect ruefully that, now that France\r\nwas a party to the _collective note_, they must join with the Powers\r\nin devising measures for depriving Mehemet Ali of the fruits of his\r\nvictories. Nor could they escape from the dilemma by disavowing\r\nAdmiral Roussin, seeing that he had only acted in strict accordance\r\nwith the policy which Soult himself had advocated, in the secret\r\nhope of isolating Russia. But it was evident that the Cabinet of St.\r\nPetersburg was reconciled to the necessity of allowing the eastern\r\nquestion to be settled by the Powers, and it was to be apprehended\r\nthat both Russia and Austria would adopt the hostile attitude towards\r\nMehemet Ali which Palmerston had already assumed.\r\n\r\nPalmerston had invariably proclaimed the opinion that the whole\r\nof Syria must be restored to the Sultan, before a permanent peace\r\ncould be established in the East. The Egyptian desert, he had always\r\ninsisted, must be interposed between the Pasha and the territories\r\nunder the direct rule of the Porte.[503] Soult had hitherto contrived\r\nto elude a discussion upon this point by declaring that France and\r\nEngland must, in the first place, concert measures for checkmating the\r\ndesigns of Russia upon the integrity of Turkey.[504] Palmerston, so\r\nlong as he was doubtful about the Tsar's intentions, had been content\r\nto leave in abeyance the question of the future position of Mehemet\r\nAli. But his tone changed from the moment that he became aware that\r\nRussia had adhered to the _collective note_. The French government on\r\nvarious pleas had declined to entertain his proposal that the French\r\nand English squadrons should combine for the purpose of obtaining\r\nfrom Mehemet Ali the surrender of the Turkish fleet.[505] On August\r\n20, however, in a dispatch which Mr. Bulwer, the British _chargé\r\nd'affaires_ was directed to communicate to Marshal Soult, he insisted\r\nthat the restitution of the Turkish ships must be regarded as an\r\nindispensable preliminary to any negotiations between the five Powers\r\nand the Pasha. Furthermore, he declared that the decision as to the\r\nmeasures, which should be taken to obtain this result, \"should emanate\r\nfrom Vienna, which was to be the central point of the negotiations\r\ninstead of London or Paris,\" and that Sir Robert Stopford would be\r\ninstructed to comply with whatever directions he might receive from\r\nLord Beauvale, \"either with or without the co-operation of anyone of\r\nthe other squadrons.\"[506]\r\n\r\nThe French government, however, displayed a marked reluctance\r\nto enter into any general discussion of the Egyptian question.\r\nNotwithstanding that Soult had himself suggested Vienna as the seat of\r\nthe negotiation, when he was under the impression that Russia would\r\nobject to confer with the Powers on the affairs of the East, he now\r\ndeprecated the selection of that capital.[507] The French government,\r\nreported Bulwer, on August 30, will refuse to consent to any measures\r\nof coercion against the Pasha, \"until the whole question--that portion\r\nof it relative to the Dardanelles and Russia as well as that relating\r\nto Egypt and Mehemet Ali--is decided.\"[508] About a fortnight later,\r\nBulwer was enabled to ascertain Louis Philippe's opinions upon the\r\nsituation. It was advisable, the King considered, to discover what\r\nwould satisfy the Pasha, and then to insist upon the Porte making the\r\nrequired concessions. When Bulwer objected that such a course was\r\nhardly consistent with the _collective note of July_ 27, His Majesty\r\ngave him to understand that \"in affairs of this kind, all notions of\r\nhonour and dignity among States need not be greatly considered. I want\r\npeace,\" said he, \"nothing but peace, and I see no way of preserving it\r\nbut by soldering up this affair as soon as possible.\" The discussion\r\nthen turned upon the military means which were available for the\r\ncoercion of the Pasha. \"Naval measures,\" Louis Philippe declared,\r\n\"would prove insufficient; bayonets were needed, and we (England?)\r\nhad no bayonets to employ.\"[509]\r\n\r\nThe very high estimate which had been formed in France of the power of\r\nMehemet Ali was the chief reason of the attitude which her government\r\nnow proceeded to adopt. Palmerston, on the other hand, had no share\r\nin the illusions which were very generally entertained as to the\r\nstrength of the Pasha. Nor had the battle of Nezib caused him to\r\nalter his views. Yet neither Sir Robert Stopford,[510] the admiral\r\nof the Mediterranean squadron, nor Colonel Campbell, the British\r\nconsul-general at Alexandria, agreed with him. Both were convinced\r\nthat the expulsion of Ibrahim from Syria would prove a most difficult\r\nundertaking, and Campbell was to owe his recall to his strongly\r\nexpressed opinion upon this point.[511] Palmerston appears to have\r\nplaced the greatest faith in General Chrzanowski, the Pole, who for\r\nthe past three years had been attached to the British embassy at\r\nConstantinople. This officer had made a careful study of the brief\r\ncampaign which had terminated at Nezib, and was not prepared to admit\r\nthat Ibrahim's victory was due to the superiority of the Egyptian army\r\nover that of the Turks.[512] The result, he considered, would have\r\nbeen very different had Hafiz Pasha elected to follow the advice of\r\nMoltke, instead of listening to the foolish talk of the _Mullahs_,\r\nwho ranked as lieutenant-generals, and were present in large numbers\r\nat his headquarters.[513] On the morning of June 24, when the battle\r\nhad only lasted an hour, no less than twelve Egyptian battalions fled\r\nfrom the field, whilst three others deserted in a body to the Turks.\r\nThe panic, which set in shortly afterwards among the troops of Hafiz\r\nPasha, was caused by a change of position on the part of a brigade\r\nof their own cavalry. It was significant that, although the battle\r\nhad consisted only of an artillery duel, and although the Egyptian\r\ninfantry had never been really engaged, Ibrahim had not ventured to\r\npursue. The report of General Jochmus,[514] a Hanoverian who had\r\nserved upon the staff of the British legion in Spain, and who was now\r\nin the pay of the Foreign Office, pointed to the same conclusions.\r\nChrzanowski, moreover, was convinced that Ibrahim would be unable\r\nto keep up his communications with Egypt, were he to be deprived\r\nof the command of the sea. A corps of 15,000 Turkish troops acting\r\nin combination with the disaffected tribes, and supported by the\r\nBritish fleet, would, he believed, suffice to compel him to evacuate\r\nSyria.[515]\r\n\r\nWhilst symptoms of disagreement between the French and English\r\ngovernments were beginning to appear, Russia made an unexpected\r\nmove. Shortly after the arrival at St. Petersburg of a despatch from\r\nCount Medem, in which he reported that Marshal Soult had declared to\r\nhim that France would never consent to apply coercion to the Pasha,\r\nBaron Brunnow, the Russian minister at Stuttgart, was sent upon a\r\nspecial mission to London. \"It would not be possible,\" Nesselrode\r\ninformed Clanricarde, \"for the Emperor to have chosen any person\r\nmore thoroughly acquainted with the foreign affairs and policy of\r\nRussia than the Baron.\"[516] The proposals, which upon his arrival in\r\nLondon, on September 15, Brunnow was empowered to make, filled Lord\r\nPalmerston with astonishment. The Imperial Cabinet, he was instructed\r\nto declare, agreed with the English government in thinking that alone\r\nthe hereditary pashalic of Egypt should be conferred upon Mehemet Ali,\r\nwho must be made to restore to the Sultan Arabia, Syria and Crete. The\r\nEmperor was ready to enter into a treaty to enforce these measures\r\nupon the Pasha, and he, therefore, suggested that such military\r\noperations as might be necessary in Syria or in Egypt should be\r\nundertaken by Great Britain, France and Austria, whilst, in the event\r\nof Ibrahim advancing to the Bosphorus, the defence of Constantinople\r\nshould devolve upon Russia. It was, however, to be clearly understood\r\nthat any assistance which Russia might afford would be given, not by\r\nreason of the Treaty of Unkiar-Skelessi, but in virtue of engagements\r\nabout to be contracted between the Powers of Europe and the Sultan.\r\nFurthermore, the Emperor was ready to adopt the view of the British\r\ngovernment and to consider \"as a permanent principle and standing\r\nrule,\" that the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles should be closed to the\r\nwar ships of all nations. Lastly, Baron Brunnow was authorized to\r\npromise that, if Russia and England should come to an understanding on\r\nthese matters, the Treaty of Unkiar-Skelessi would not be renewed.[517]\r\n\r\nThe Tsar's sudden determination to abandon those advantages, which\r\nhe was supposed to have acquired by the Treaty of Unkiar-Skelessi,\r\nhas always been ascribed to his desire to separate France and\r\nEngland. Without doubt, this consideration entered largely into his\r\ncalculations. But he was also annoyed with Metternich and was anxious\r\nto thwart his plan of establishing the seat of the negotiations\r\nat Vienna. Moreover, it was now realized that Orloff's treaty was\r\na document of no practical value. Russia, by reason alone of her\r\ngeographical position, could never be prevented from exercising her\r\ninfluence over the counsels of the Porte. Nor could the stipulation\r\nthat the Sultan must close the Dardanelles at the demand of Russia\r\nbe of any real utility, seeing that the maritime Powers had refused\r\nto accept this condition, and that Turkey would be unable to carry\r\nout her engagements in the face of their opposition. In a general way\r\nthe doctrine that a weak State makes an excellent neighbour might\r\nbe sound, but it was plainly inapplicable to Turkey--the custodian\r\nof straits so vitally important to Russia as the Bosphorus and the\r\nDardanelles. Under these circumstances, there was much to be gained by\r\nwaiving the purely illusory advantage to be derived from the Treaty of\r\nUnkiar-Skelessi, and by agreeing that the closure of the straits to\r\nthe warships of the Powers should be declared a law of nations.[518]\r\nBrunnow made no secret of the fact that his Imperial master would be\r\nonly too pleased, were France to refuse to accede to his proposals.\r\nHis desire was soon gratified. When the project was communicated\r\nto it by Lord Palmerston, the French government flatly declined to\r\nentertain it. The Russian overture, wrote Marshal Soult, was clearly\r\na device for separating France and England, and it was with \"feelings\r\nof painful astonishment\" that he perceived \"a man of such enlightened\r\njudgment as Lord Palmerston entertain it with so much complacency.\"\r\nRussia, he proceeded, had betrayed her real intentions by insisting\r\nthat she alone should undertake the defence of Constantinople. If\r\nher motives were such as she pretended, why this repugnance to the\r\nidea of \"the flags of the allied Courts floating side by side with\r\nher own\" in the Bosphorus? \"Never,\" he concluded, \"with our consent\r\nshall a foreign squadron of war appear before Constantinople, unless\r\nours appears there also.\"[519] Whilst he thus declined absolutely to\r\nconsider Baron Brunnow's propositions, Marshal Soult put forward a\r\nplan for the settlement of the questions in dispute between the Porte\r\nand Mehemet Ali. But the solution of the difficulty, suggested by the\r\nFrench government, when it came to be examined, was found to amount to\r\nlittle more than an arrangement whereby the Pasha was to obtain the\r\nhereditary tenure of Arabia, Syria and Egypt, in return for which he\r\nwas to restore to the Sultan the district of Adana.[520]\r\n\r\nIn Palmerston's opinion the entry of a Russian fleet into the\r\nBosphorus, or of a Russian army into Asia Minor, at the demand of the\r\nPowers, was a very different proceeding to an intervention in virtue\r\nof a separate engagement between the Porte and the Cabinet of St.\r\nPetersburg. Had the decision rested with him alone he would gladly\r\nhave accepted the Russian proposal. But both it and Marshal Soult's\r\ndespatch had to be considered by the Cabinet, some of the members of\r\nwhich held opinions very opposed to his own. Lord Holland and several\r\nof his colleagues--\"our Whig friends\"[521] as Lord Palmerston called\r\nthem--were either completely indifferent to the Imperial aspect of the\r\nquestion, or regarded it as a minor consideration. In their eyes the\r\npoint at issue was simply whether England should break with Liberal\r\nFrance, in order to enter into a compact with autocratic Russia. The\r\nFrench party in the Cabinet gained the upper hand and Palmerston\r\nhad to agree to certain concessions. He had already consented, in\r\ndeference to the wishes of France and Austria, to allow his demand\r\nfor the restoration by Mehemet Ali of the Turkish fleet to be merged\r\nin the larger question of the territorial settlement, and he was now\r\nobliged to inform Sébastiani that the English government would be\r\nprepared to see, in addition to that of Egypt, the hereditary tenure\r\nof the province of Acre, exclusive of the fortress, conferred upon\r\nthe Pasha. At the same time Baron Brunnow was to be told that Her\r\nMajesty's government was ready to adopt the whole arrangement which\r\nhe had proposed, with the exception of one single point--should it be\r\nnecessary for a Russian force to enter the Bosphorus, a British force\r\nmust enter the Dardanelles.[522]\r\n\r\nBrunnow had no instructions to discuss the question raised by the\r\nEnglish Cabinet, and he was, in consequence, obliged to bring his\r\nmission to an unsuccessful conclusion. But he and Palmerston parted\r\nfrom each other upon most excellent terms and with little doubt that\r\ntheir negotiations were suspended, rather than finally broken off.\r\nThe French government heard of the Baron's departure with intense\r\nsatisfaction, and, a few days later, on October 15, Sébastiani\r\ncommunicated to Lord Palmerston a despatch, in which Marshal Soult\r\nemphatically declared that the proposal to cede to Mehemet Ali the\r\nPashalic of Acre was inadmissible. So trifling a concession, he\r\naverred, would merely drive the Pasha to seek to obtain by the sword\r\nthe frontiers to which he considered himself entitled. Palmerston\r\nlistened to the words of the ambassador in silence, and when he had\r\nconcluded his statement, informed him that the offer regarding Acre\r\nmust now be considered as definitely withdrawn.[523]\r\n\r\nIt was significant of the divergent courses upon which the two\r\ngovernments were embarked that, almost at the same time, Admiral\r\nRoussin was recalled from Constantinople, and Colonel Campbell from\r\nAlexandria--the Frenchman because of his hostility to,[524] and\r\nthe Englishman because of his sympathy with, Mehemet Ali.[525] For\r\nseveral weeks after Brunnow's departure from London, the situation\r\nremained unchanged. Palmerston was content to wait in the confident\r\nexpectation that Nicholas would not refuse to accede to the British\r\nproposal. The Soult Cabinet, convinced that no agreement between\r\nEngland and Russia on the question of the Dardanelles was to be\r\napprehended, was equally satisfied to remain inactive. \"In the French\r\ncouncils,\" reported Bulwer, \"there is a mixture of positiveness and of\r\nvagueness--positiveness as to what will not be done, vagueness as to\r\nwhat may be done.\"[526]\r\n\r\nEarly in December Sébastiani transmitted to his government the\r\ninformation, which he had received from Palmerston, that the Emperor\r\nhad agreed to the English conditions, and that Brunnow would shortly\r\nreturn to London to negotiate a convention. This news came as an\r\nunpleasant surprise to the French Cabinet. Under the circumstances,\r\nhowever, Soult could only express satisfaction at this most unexpected\r\nconcession, which, he admitted, completely altered the character of\r\nthe Russian proposals. But, at the same time, he cast the gravest\r\ndoubts upon the good faith of the Imperial Cabinet, and reiterated his\r\nconviction that its real object was to effect a breach in French and\r\nEnglish relations.[527] In due course Brunnow arrived in London, and\r\nin a note written at Holland House, on January 5, 1840, Palmerston\r\nmade Sébastiani acquainted with the result of his first deliberations\r\nwith the Russian envoy. \"Brunnow,\" he informed him, \"is empowered to\r\nnegotiate with the object of bringing about a permanent and definite\r\nsolution of the Turkish and Egyptian question, in order to ensure the\r\nindependence and integrity of the Ottoman Empire. Baron Neumann has\r\narrived from Vienna and has expressed to us that Austria is entirely\r\nwith us and Russia in this important affair. I think I can say for\r\ncertain that Prussia will look at matters in the same light. It only\r\nremains for us, therefore, to secure a European accord on a question\r\nwhich is incontestably the most important that we have had to deal\r\nwith these last years. We sincerely hope that the co-operation of\r\nFrance will not be refused. . . .\"[528]\r\n\r\nLouis Philippe and his ministers were convinced, however, that, when\r\nthe Powers came to consider the measures which would be required\r\nfor expelling the Pasha from the territories which he occupied,\r\nthey would soon discover the magnitude of the task upon which they\r\npurposed to embark. Harsh conditions, they were confident, would never\r\nbe imposed upon him, once it was realized that their enforcement\r\nwould entail the invasion of Syria by a large Russian army. They\r\nwere, in consequence, not apprehensive, although fully informed that\r\nnegotiations were in progress, that any definite arrangement would\r\nbe concluded without their participation. Nevertheless, on January\r\n27, 1840, Sébastiani[529] reported that Palmerston had replied in the\r\naffirmative to Neumann's official inquiry as to whether, in the event\r\nof the four Powers arriving at an agreement, and France withholding\r\nher consent, the clauses of the treaty would be acted upon in spite of\r\nher abstention. But, on the following day, the ambassador informed his\r\ngovernment that the English Cabinet had decided that the Porte must\r\nbe a party to any convention which might be concluded, and that the\r\nnegotiations would, in consequence, be suspended until the arrival of\r\nthe Turkish plenipotentiary. This was the last news of any importance\r\ntransmitted by Sébastiani. Soult and his colleagues, in order to\r\npropitiate the _Doctrinaires_, whose support was essential to their\r\nparliamentary existence, had insisted upon his recall and upon the\r\nappointment of M. Guizot to the embassy in London.[530]\r\n\r\nAlthough he had studied English constitutional history so deeply,\r\nGuizot had never visited England, and, moreover, he had not before\r\nbeen engaged upon a diplomatic mission. He had, however, formed a\r\nfriendship with Princess Lieven, who was well acquainted with most of\r\nthe chief statesmen and members of the _corps diplomatique_ of the\r\ntime, and who, besides, had been a leader of English society. After\r\nher husband's recall from London,[531] the Princess quickly tired of\r\nSt. Petersburg, and, upon the plea of ill-health, took up her abode in\r\nParis. At Talleyrand's death in 1838, she moved into an apartment in\r\nhis famous house in the Rue Saint-Florentin, where her _salon_ soon\r\nacquired a European celebrity. Her friendship with Guizot, which was\r\nto endure to the day of her death, is said to have begun, in 1837, at\r\nChatenay, Madame de Boigne's house, near Paris. The Princess was at\r\nthe time fifty-three years of age, whilst the grave _Doctrinaire_ was\r\nthree years her junior.[532]\r\n\r\nGuizot arrived in London on February 28, and, on the following day\r\nin Paris, the Soult Cabinet was defeated and resigned. The King\r\nwas, in consequence, reluctantly compelled to commission M. Thiers\r\nto form a government. Thiers, who himself assumed the direction of\r\nForeign Affairs, was probably honestly desirous of maintaining a\r\ngood understanding with England. But he was a convinced believer\r\nin the military strength of Mehemet Ali, and was determined to\r\nuphold his claim to the hereditary tenure of Syria. In his opinion,\r\nthe _collective note of July_ 27, 1839, was the cause of all the\r\ndifficulty; it was \"the rut in which the coach had stuck.\"[533] But,\r\nalthough he was secretly resolved to escape from the obligations\r\nwhich his predecessors had contracted, he was not prepared openly to\r\nrepudiate them. On the contrary, he admitted readily that he was bound\r\nto refrain from attempting to arrange matters between the Porte and\r\nMehemet Ali, except in co-operation with the other signatory Powers.\r\nShould, however, the Sultan spontaneously agree to terms acceptable to\r\nthe Pasha, the Powers could hardly interfere to prevent a settlement\r\nwhich the Porte itself pronounced satisfactory.[534] If such a result\r\ncould be brought about, the _collective note_ would become a dead\r\nletter, and France would regain her full liberty of action. Moreover,\r\nMehemet Ali would attain the object of his ambition in a large measure\r\nowing to the goodwill of the French government.\r\n\r\nSoult had instructed Guizot to declare that France was sincerely\r\nanxious to establish a permanent and lasting peace in the East. But\r\nto attain the desired result, she was convinced that Mehemet Ali\r\nmust, at least, be given the hereditary tenure of Syria and Egypt. He\r\nwas to impress upon Palmerston that the real object of the \"trifling\r\nconcessions,\" which Brunnow had been empowered to make, was to obtain\r\nthe signature of England to some agreement to which France would\r\nrefuse to adhere.[535] Thiers, in his first despatch, expressed his\r\napproval of these instructions, and of the language which M. Guizot\r\nhad employed in carrying them out. He directed him to persevere with\r\nhis arguments and constantly to impress upon the British government\r\nthat France had no \"_parti pris_,\" no \"_système irrévocable_,\" nor\r\nwas she bound by either promises or engagements to the Pasha. Her\r\nsole desire was to contribute to the establishment of peace upon a\r\nfirm and durable foundation. The coercion of Mehemet Ali would demand\r\na vast expenditure of military strength, and Lord Palmerston would,\r\ndoubtless, agree that the armed intervention of Russia would greatly\r\nmenace the independent existence of the Ottoman Empire.[536] Thiers,\r\nwhose judgment on this, as on many other occasions, was greatly\r\ninfluenced by his hopes, was persuaded that the decision to call in a\r\nTurkish plenipotentiary, and the delay which it entailed, signified\r\nthat the plans of Palmerston and Brunnow had encountered some serious\r\nobstacle. But the longer the negotiations could be drawn out, the\r\nbetter he would be pleased. Whilst matters were drifting to a deadlock\r\nin London, his agents, he trusted, would be enabled quietly to effect\r\nsome definite arrangement at Constantinople or at Cairo.[537]\r\n\r\nGuizot in his _Mémoires_ has described at length his proceedings in\r\nLondon. As he himself admits, he entertained an exaggerated belief\r\nin the strength of Mehemet Ali.[538] But, on the other hand, he had\r\nnot Thiers' serene confidence that England would never conclude an\r\nagreement for the settlement of the Turco-Egyptian question without\r\nthe co-operation of France. On March 12, when relating a conversation\r\nhe had had with Lord Palmerston in one of the drawing-rooms at\r\nStafford House, he expressed the opinion \"that the British government\r\nregarded the present moment as a favourable opportunity for settling\r\naffairs in the East, and that a sudden resolve might be taken to\r\nact without us.\" Again, a few days later, he sent M. Thiers a\r\nwarning couched in more emphatic language. Full powers to conclude\r\na convention, Lord Palmerston informed him, had been transmitted to\r\nNourri-Effendi, the Turkish ambassador in Paris, who would shortly\r\narrive in London. \"It is possible, therefore, that we may be on the\r\neve of important decisions. . . . The British government has two\r\ninterests at stake in the eastern question--the wish to keep Russia\r\nfrom Constantinople and the fear of French influence in Egypt. . . .\r\nThe present moment is looked upon as favourable for the attainment\r\nof these objects. By a singular combination of circumstances, Russia\r\nis both prepared to abandon her pretensions to exercise an exclusive\r\nprotectorship over the Ottoman Empire, and to assist England to weaken\r\nthe Pasha of Egypt. . . . Great Britain, consequently, is far from\r\nregarding the present situation as embarrassing, but on the contrary\r\ndeems it a most fortunate development which she must make use of to\r\nthe best advantage. . . . She is aware, however, that in prosecuting\r\nthis policy she may impair her good understanding with France. To\r\nretain our friendship she will make some concessions, but I am\r\ndisposed to think that she has no intention of allowing the present\r\nopportunity of attaining her ends in the East to escape.\"[539]\r\n\r\nMatters, nevertheless, proceeded very slowly. Nor was the situation\r\naltered by the arrival, early in April, of Nourri-Effendi. The Porte\r\nin sending him to London only desired to make manifest its intention\r\nof conferring with its allies. When the deliberations should begin in\r\nearnest, it purposed to be represented by Chekib-Effendi, who had been\r\nappointed Ottoman ambassador at the Court of St. James', and another\r\nmonth must elapse before he could reach England. Guizot, however,\r\nreported that he perceived a strong tendency upon the part of both\r\nAustria and Prussia to draw closer to France. Bülow had asked him in\r\nconfidence whether the concession to Mehemet Ali of the governorship\r\nof Syria for his life would meet with the approval of his government.\r\nNeumann had also talked to him in the same strain. But Thiers was\r\nlittle disposed to accept any compromise. These overtures, in his\r\nopinion, were symptoms that the Powers were beginning to realize that\r\nthey were in a false position. Before long, he was certain, they\r\nwould adopt the French view of the question in its entirety. Until\r\nsome agreement should be arrived at with England, he recommended\r\nthat Guizot should abstain, as far as possible, from any discussions\r\nwith the ministers of the Northern Courts.[540] Nor was Palmerston's\r\nsuggestion admissible that the Turco-Egyptian difficulty should be\r\nsubmitted to a conference of the Powers. Under existing conditions,\r\n\"the differences between France and her allies were too marked to\r\npermit of any general deliberation conducing to a satisfactory\r\nresult.\"\r\n\r\nIn the month of March, Palmerston's brother, Sir William Temple, the\r\nBritish minister at Naples, had been instructed to insist upon the\r\nimmediate execution of the King's promise to abolish the sulphur\r\nmonopoly and to ask for an indemnity on behalf of the English\r\nmerchants who had suffered by its imposition. Upon King Ferdinand's\r\nrefusal to comply with this demand, Admiral Sir Robert Stopford was\r\ndirected to blockade the coast and to seize and send to Malta such\r\nNeapolitan merchant vessels as he could capture. Thiers, having\r\nascertained that his offer would be acceptable to both parties,\r\nproposed to mediate in the dispute. He was glad of the opportunity,\r\nwhich was thus afforded him, of displaying both that France and\r\nEngland were still upon excellent terms and of extending French\r\ninfluence in Italy. Thiers' mediation was successful. The Neapolitan\r\nCourt conceded the British demands, and, early in July in consequence,\r\nthe blockading squadron was free to carry out Palmerston's policy in\r\nanother direction. Soon after it had accepted his offer to settle\r\nthe sulphur dispute, Thiers made a second proposal to the English\r\ngovernment. In this instance he was probably desirous simply of\r\nacquiring popularity at home.[541] On May 10, Guizot formally asked\r\nthat the remains of Napoleon might be handed over to a deputation of\r\nofficers and conveyed back to France, on board a French warship, for\r\ninterment in Paris. Palmerston made no difficulty about immediately\r\ncomplying with this request.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary confidence of both Louis Philippe and of M. Thiers\r\nthat, under no circumstances, would Great Britain separate herself\r\nfrom France in the eastern question[542] reposed upon their joint\r\nconviction that Palmerston's colleagues in the government would never\r\nallow him to disturb the harmony of French and English relations. Mr.\r\nEllice,[543] the brother-in-law of Lord Grey, and a former Cabinet\r\nminister, was largely responsible for encouraging this erroneous\r\nbelief, which was to bring the two countries to the verge of war.\r\nSince about the year 1835, \"Bear Ellice,\" as he was generally known,\r\nby reason of his connection with the Canadian fur trade, had been much\r\nin Paris. Although he appears to have disliked the responsibilities\r\nof office, he was keenly interested in public affairs and was\r\nan inveterate political gossip. Grey, who was well aware of his\r\nbrother-in-law's vanity and peculiarities, nicknamed him _le grand\r\nfaiseur_. In Paris he frequented Princess Lieven's _salon_, where\r\nhe was consulted and listened to with a deference which he enjoyed\r\nexceedingly.[544] Not only was he very intimate with M. Thiers, but,\r\naccording to Creevey,[545] \"Louis Philippe could scarcely bear to\r\nhave him out of his sight.\" \"I hear,\" wrote Palmerston at a most\r\ncritical time, \"that Thiers says he has three agents upon whom he can\r\nrely--Guizot, Flahaut[546] and Ellice.\"[547]\r\n\r\nGuizot had quickly discovered that the Cabinet was not united upon the\r\neastern question. At Holland House, where he was a constant guest,\r\nneither his host nor hostess concealed from him their antagonism\r\nto Palmerston. Clarendon, notwithstanding the insight into Louis\r\nPhilippe's diplomacy which he had acquired at Madrid, was a declared\r\nopponent of any solution of the Turco-Egyptian difficulty which might\r\nendanger the French alliance. Charles Greville, with whom Guizot\r\nappears to have become very friendly, had no scruples about informing\r\nhim of any dissensions in ministerial circles. The vindictive clerk\r\nof the council detested Palmerston and distrusted his policy. Dedel,\r\nthe Dutch minister, in talking over these events a year or two later\r\nwith the Duchesse de Dino,[548] expressed the opinion that Guizot's\r\ngreat mistake lay in imagining that intrigue played as large a part\r\nin public affairs in London as in Paris. Palmerston, he told her, had\r\nproofs of his proceedings, which would have justified him in demanding\r\nhis recall. This last statement is probably somewhat exaggerated.\r\nGuizot, however, whatever he may have done, appears to have judged the\r\nsituation with great discernment. \"Not to mention Lords Holland and\r\nClarendon,\" he wrote to Thiers on June 1, \"Melbourne and Lansdowne\r\nwould be very loath to see the French alliance dissolved. . . Yet\r\nPalmerston, I believe, is as firm as ever, and I am far from certain\r\nwhether those of his colleagues who disagree with him would stand up\r\nto him very firmly, when it comes to the point.\"[549]\r\n\r\nThe overtures which Bülow and Neumann had made to Guizot were followed\r\nby a definite proposal from Austria. Metternich was alarmed. He\r\nbelieved that Palmerston had formed a totally erroneous opinion of\r\nthe military situation. He was certain that naval assistance alone\r\nwould not enable the Turks to regain possession of Syria. He had no\r\nintention of allowing Austrian troops to be employed in the East, and\r\nRussia had recently sustained reverses in the Caucasus which might\r\nmake it difficult for her to send an imposing force into Asia Minor.\r\nGreat Britain was engaged upon warlike operations in Afghanistan, and\r\nwas, besides, threatened with trouble in China and Canada. It would\r\nbe, therefore, an arduous undertaking to attempt to coerce the Pasha\r\nwithout the co-operation of France. To obtain her assistance, he\r\nsuggested that Syria should be divided into two portions. The southern\r\nhalf, including the fortress of Acre, might, he proposed, be given\r\nto Mehemet Ali. But, should the French government be not satisfied\r\nwith this concession, Austria would agree to enforce these conditions\r\nupon the Pasha in combination with England and Russia and without the\r\nparticipation of France.[550]\r\n\r\nPalmerston reluctantly decided to agree to the Austrian proposal and,\r\non May 8, officially informed Guizot that the British government\r\nadhered to it. But this concession only served to strengthen Thiers'\r\nbelief that the Powers would before long adopt his views completely.\r\nChekib-Effendi had not yet arrived, and there was, therefore, no\r\nnecessity for returning an immediate answer. Even when the Turkish\r\nplenipotentiary reached London, Palmerston appeared to be in no hurry\r\nto resume the negotiations. On the other hand, Guizot was inclined\r\nto think that the representatives of the other Powers were growing\r\nrestless. Even Brunnow seemed disposed to adopt a more conciliatory\r\nattitude, and there appeared to be a growing feeling that no\r\nsettlement could be concluded without the assent of France. Thiers'\r\nanswer to the Austrian plan of partitioning Syria could not, however,\r\nbe indefinitely postponed, and, on June 16, he directed Guizot to tell\r\nLord Palmerston that he could not entertain it. \"We could not,\" he\r\nwrote, \"suggest it to Mehemet Ali; he would refuse it, and we could\r\nnot refute his arguments which we should ourselves consider to be\r\nsound and well founded.\" He was greatly struck by the account which\r\nGuizot had sent him of Brunnow's attitude, \"which could only be\r\nascribed to disasters in Circassia. It was clear that Russia was not\r\nready to embark upon serious operations elsewhere.\"[551]\r\n\r\nWhen Thiers thus declined to consider the Austrian proposal,\r\nhe believed that his hopes of bringing about secretly a direct\r\narrangement between the Sultan and the Pasha were about to be\r\nrealized. Mehemet Ali had been unable wholly to conceal his\r\ndisappointment on learning of the _collective note of July_ 27, 1839.\r\nWhen it was officially communicated to him by the consuls of the\r\nPowers, he declared firmly that there could be no peace until the\r\nhereditary tenure of Syria should be conferred upon him and until\r\nhis enemy Hosrew Pasha, the Grand Vizier, should be dismissed from\r\noffice.[552] Since then, he had sometimes angrily asserted that\r\nhe would wait no longer and that he should order Ibrahim to march\r\nupon Constantinople, whilst, on other occasions, he had shown a\r\ndisposition to adopt a more conciliatory attitude. Throughout the\r\nwinter and the spring he pressed on his military preparations. Some\r\nof these, however, proved very unsuccessful--an attempt to form a\r\nnational guard in Egypt itself breaking down completely.[553] At the\r\nsame time he appears to have experienced great difficulty in keeping\r\nIbrahim's army in Syria supplied with money, food, and clothing,[554]\r\nwhilst, to add to his embarrassments, in the spring, the Druses and\r\nother tribes began to display renewed symptoms of disaffection.[555]\r\nPalmerston, now that he no longer feared the separate intervention\r\nof Russia, would probably have been well pleased could the Pasha have\r\nbeen provoked into some act of aggression against the Sultan. But he\r\nwas too sagacious to be moved from his attitude of prudent inaction\r\nby the threatening language of Campbell's successor, Colonel Hodges,\r\nwhich, however, caused some alarm at Vienna and at St. Petersburg,\r\nwhere neither Metternich nor Nesselrode entertained Palmerston's\r\ncontemptuous disbelief in the military power of Mehemet Ali.[556]\r\nM. Thiers seems to have been wilfully blind to the difficulties of\r\nthe Pasha's position, and to have persuaded himself that it was from\r\nrespect to the wishes of the French government that Ibrahim abstained\r\nfrom advancing into Asia Minor.\r\n\r\nM. Cochelet, the French consul-general, was probably instructed[557]\r\nto urge Mehemet Ali to refrain from hostilities, to limit his demands\r\nto the hereditary tenure of Syria and Egypt and, generally, to depend\r\nupon the good offices of France for the attainment of his wishes. M.\r\nThiers, however, was well aware that his plan of bringing about a\r\ndirect arrangement between the Sultan and the Pasha would encounter\r\nfar more serious difficulties at Constantinople than at Cairo.\r\nEver since the arrival of M. de Pontois, the successor of Admiral\r\nRoussin, Ponsonby had constantly reported that the French minister was\r\nendeavouring to persuade the Porte to conclude a peace with Mehemet\r\nAli, without reference to the Powers.[558] But the advice of M. de\r\nPontois had hitherto been disregarded. Hosrew, Reshid, and Halil\r\nPasha, the most influential of the Turkish ministers, were very\r\nhostile to Mehemet Ali and firm supporters of the British policy.\r\nSoon after his accession to office, Thiers appears to have decided to\r\nsupplement the efforts of the recognized representative of the French\r\ngovernment by those of an unofficial agent. At the beginning of May,\r\na correspondence was opened between M. Jacques Coste[559] and Fethi\r\nAhmed Pasha, the Minister of Commerce and brother-in-law to the young\r\nSultan. Under ordinary circumstances there would be nothing to excite\r\nattention in the fact that a prominent French journalist should write\r\non political matters to a Turkish statesman, whom he had known as\r\nOttoman ambassador in Paris. But the close intimacy which notoriously\r\nexisted between M. Coste and M. Thiers gives importance to this\r\nparticular correspondence. Certainly both Palmerston and Ponsonby and,\r\nindeed, Ahmed Pasha himself, who delivered the original letters into\r\nthe hands of the British ambassador, appear to have been satisfied\r\nthat the sentiments and advice contained in them emanated from M.\r\nThiers.[560]\r\n\r\nThe primary object which M. Coste had in view was to persuade Fethi\r\nAhmed Pasha that it was essential for the Porte promptly to conclude\r\na peace with Mehemet Ali. All the powers, he contended, were pursuing\r\nselfish ends with the sole exception of France, and she was both\r\nresolved not to intervene herself and not to allow any other Power\r\nto interfere actively in the Turco-Egyptian dispute. Her hands were\r\nfree and she was strong enough to enforce her will upon Europe. The\r\nperfidy of England's policy was manifest. As in 1839, Great Britain\r\nnow proposed to incite the Porte to make war upon the Pasha. If she\r\ncould achieve this object she would, of a surety, encourage Russia to\r\nintervene in order to crush the Egyptians, whilst at the same time she\r\nwould insist at Vienna and in Paris upon the necessity of preventing\r\nthe occupation of Constantinople by the armies of the Tsar. Should she\r\nbe enabled to carry out her Machiavellian plan of bringing about a\r\ngeneral war she purposed, in the confusion, quietly to lay hands upon\r\nEgypt, which she had long coveted for herself. He was sorry to hear\r\nthat Chekib-Effendi, when passing through Paris, had declared to M.\r\nThiers that it would be better that England should take Egypt, than\r\nthat it should continue in the possession of a rebellious vassal of\r\nthe Sultan. Such reasoning was deplorably unsound. \"That which England\r\ntakes she keeps,\" whereas, in the future, it should be an easy task\r\nfor the Sultan to compel the descendants of Mehemet Ali to give back\r\nthe territories which must now be surrendered temporarily. Writing on\r\nJune 8, M. Coste suggested, as a compromise, that Syria might be given\r\nto Ibrahim and Adana to another son of the Pasha. They would certainly\r\nquarrel among themselves, and the Porte might avail itself of their\r\ndissensions for expelling them altogether. Let the Sultan be assured\r\nof the wisdom of the old saying, \"_diviser pour regner_.\"[561] This\r\ncurious correspondence continued intermittently until the fall of M.\r\nThiers in September. But after the end of June, Coste's communications\r\nbecame less frequent and were less cordially expressed. On July 8\r\nhe explained that the silence with which his well-meant advice had\r\nbeen received \"had placed him in an awkward position with M. Thiers,\"\r\nwhilst to Prince Vogoride, a son of the Prince of Samos, another of\r\nhis correspondents, he conveyed his surprise and annoyance that his\r\nletters, written \"_en quelque sorte sous la dictée d'un tres haut\r\npersonnage_\" should have elicited no response.[562]\r\n\r\nWhilst the French agents at Constantinople were thus striving to\r\nrender nugatory the provisions of the _collective note_, another\r\nattempt to achieve the desired result was being made in a different\r\nquarter. The Sultana Mother was believed to have been concerned in\r\nthe secret negotiation conducted by Sarim-Effendi,[563] under the\r\npatronage of Admiral Roussin and M. Mimaut, during M. Thiers' first\r\nadministration, and her support was now obtained to the plan of a\r\ndirect arrangement between the Sultan and the Pasha. The sudden\r\ndismissal, on May 19, of Hosrew, the Grand-Vizier, was the result\r\nof her intrigues.[564] The first news of this event was conveyed to\r\nMehemet Ali by M. Cochelet. The Pasha at once declared that the fall\r\nof his old enemy had removed the last obstacle to a satisfactory\r\nconclusion of his quarrel with the Sultan. He should, he announced,\r\nforthwith send back the Turkish fleet, and Sami Bey, his confidential\r\nsecretary, should proceed without delay to Constantinople to make the\r\nnecessary arrangements.[565] Nevertheless, some three weeks elapsed\r\nbefore the Pasha's emissary started upon his journey, and it was\r\nonly on June 13, on the eve of his departure, that the object of\r\nhis mission was disclosed to Colonel Hodges and the other agents of\r\nthe Powers.[566] But Cochelet, on May 26, duly reported this new\r\ndevelopment to his government in a despatch, a copy of which M. Thiers\r\ntransmitted to M. Guizot with instructions that its contents must, for\r\nthe present, be kept strictly secret. In spite of these precautions,\r\nhowever, Cochelet's confidential communication appears to have been\r\ndivulged to Apponyi, the Austrian ambassador in Paris, who, on June\r\n16, was enabled to inform Neumann in London of the negotiation which\r\nhad been initiated between Mehemet Ali and the Sultan.[567] Meanwhile,\r\nat Constantinople, Lord Ponsonby had discovered that a potent\r\ninfluence was at work to induce the young Sultan to surrender Syria\r\nin exchange for his fleet. But, encouraged by the British ambassador,\r\nboth Reshid and Fethi Ahmed Pasha declared that they should resign,\r\nwere any compact of that kind to be concluded, and their firm attitude\r\ndefeated the insidious schemes of the Sultana Mother, and rendered\r\nabortive the mission of Sami Bey.[568]\r\n\r\nM. Thiers, however, was confident that the news of Hosrew's dismissal\r\nwould be followed quickly by the intelligence that the Sultan and\r\nthe Pasha had settled their differences amicably. This unexpected\r\ndevelopment would, he was convinced, place a totally new complexion\r\nupon the Turco-Egyptian question. But in point of fact, Palmerston\r\nhad been informed by Neumann of the negotiation which was to be\r\nopened between Mehemet Ali and the Sultan. Thus, when the news\r\nreached London of the mission of Sami Bey to Constantinople, he was\r\nfully prepared for it. Far from being suddenly confronted by the\r\nembarrassing prospect that the settlement of the affair was about to\r\npass out of his control, he was, on the contrary, enabled to adduce\r\nthe proceedings of the French agents at Constantinople and at Cairo,\r\nas a reason for promptly concluding a treaty for the protection of\r\nthe young Sultan from the machinations of his enemies.\r\n\r\nThiers' illusions were by no means shared by Guizot. The ambassador\r\ndivined correctly that the crisis of the affair was approaching. Since\r\nthe rejection of the Austrian proposals Palmerston, he reported, had\r\npointedly avoided all discussion of the eastern question with him.\r\nBut from the moment that the news arrived that a direct negotiation\r\nwas in progress between Cairo and Constantinople he had been very\r\nbusy. This last development, moreover, had made a great impression\r\nupon the representatives of the Powers, and those of them, who had\r\nlately been inclined to adopt the French view of the question, were\r\nnow, it was evident, less favourably disposed. Cabinet councils had\r\nbeen held, dissensions had arisen, and Palmerston, he believed, had\r\nthreatened to resign. It was probable, he considered, that Great\r\nBritain, Russia, Austria, and Prussia would agree to some form of\r\njoint action in the East, and that France would be formally asked\r\nwhether or not she would participate in whatever measures they might\r\nresolve to adopt.[569] This idea that no treaty would be actually\r\nconcluded until France should have been invited to adhere to it, was\r\nthe one point upon which M. Guizot may be held to have misled M.\r\nThiers. Princess Lieven, who was staying at Stafford House, is said\r\nto have encouraged his delusion. She appears to have tried to extract\r\nfrom Bülow, the Prussian minister, some information about the progress\r\nof the negotiations. Her enquiries, however, only elicited from him\r\nthe fact that he was still without the new letters of credence which\r\nthe recent death of Frederick William III. had rendered necessary.\r\nFrom this circumstance Guizot seems to have inferred that there was\r\nno immediate danger of the conclusion of a treaty between the four\r\nPowers, inasmuch as Bülow had not yet been officially accredited to\r\nthe Court of St. James'.[570]\r\n\r\nAs Guizot had correctly surmised, Palmerston experienced the\r\ngreatest difficulty in inducing his colleagues to adopt his views.\r\nBoth Holland and Clarendon strongly deprecated the conclusion of\r\nany treaty to which France would not be a party, and Melbourne and\r\nLansdowne seemed disposed to agree with them. Palmerston, thereupon,\r\nplaced his resignation in the hands of the Prime Minister.[571]\r\nIn a long letter, on July 5, in which he recapitulated the whole\r\nhistory of the Turco-Egyptian question, he explained the reasons\r\nwhich made it impossible for him to remain at his post. Were Great\r\nBritain to elude the engagements which she had contracted towards\r\nthe Sultan, because France was not prepared to co-operate with the\r\nother signatory Powers, Russia would resume once more \"her separate\r\nand isolated position\" towards Turkey. England, he contended, would\r\nthus by her own deliberate act, re-establish that protectorship of\r\nRussia over Turkey, which had for so long been a cause of apprehension\r\nto other Powers. \"The ultimate results of such a decision would be\r\nthe practical division of the Ottoman Empire into two separate and\r\nindependent States, whereof one would be a dependency of France and\r\nthe other a satellite of Russia.\" Never would he consent to be an\r\ninstrument for the execution of a policy which, he believed, must\r\nentail disastrous consequences upon his country. Unless, therefore,\r\nhis colleagues were prepared to pursue the course which he advocated\r\nhe must retire, even though his resignation should lead to a break up\r\nof the government.[572]\r\n\r\nThe most recent intelligence from the East had, moreover, supplied\r\nPalmerston with an argument which had a great effect in overcoming the\r\nresistance of his opponents in the Cabinet. A formidable insurrection\r\nwas reported to have broken out in Syria, where the tribes were in\r\nopen rebellion against Mehemet Ali. He could, therefore, contend that\r\nthe treaty, which he urged his colleagues to conclude with Russia,\r\nAustria and Prussia, was a Liberal measure, inasmuch as it meant\r\nthe delivery of an oppressed people from a tyrannical ruler. This\r\nlast consideration, combined with the desire to avoid the crisis\r\nwhich must result from the resignation of the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs, induced the dissenting members of the Cabinet reluctantly\r\nto assent to Palmerston's proposals.[573] Accordingly, on July 15,\r\n\"a convention for the pacification of the Levant\" was signed by the\r\nplenipotentiaries of Great Britain, Russia, Austria and Prussia, on\r\nthe one side, and that of the Sublime Porte on the other. In view of\r\nthe expediency of speedily affording military succour to the Syrians,\r\nit appears to have been agreed that Bülow should be considered as\r\nempowered to act on behalf of his Court.\r\n\r\nBy the convention which was thus concluded the four Powers\r\nundertook actively to assist the Sultan to reduce the Pasha to\r\nsubmission--Austria and Great Britain engaging to intercept all\r\ncommunication by sea between Egypt and Syria. To this instrument was\r\nannexed a _Separate Act_ in which were laid down the terms which the\r\nPorte purposed to offer to Mehemet Ali. The hereditary tenure of\r\nEgypt was to be conferred upon him together with the governorship\r\nfor life of the greater part of the pashalic of Acre. But, if he\r\nshould not accede to these conditions within a space of ten days,\r\nthe offer of Acre would be withdrawn. A further delay of ten days\r\nwould, however, be accorded him in which to consider the second\r\nproposal which would be limited to the hereditary pashalic of Egypt.\r\nIf, after the specified term had elapsed, he should still refuse to\r\naccept the proffered conditions, the Sultan would be free to bring\r\nthe negotiations to a conclusion and \"to follow such ulterior course\r\nas his own interests and the counsels of his allies might suggest\r\nto him.\" In a third document, known as _The Reserved Protocol_, it\r\nwas laid down that, inasmuch as \"the state of affairs in Syria, the\r\ninterests of humanity and grave considerations of European policy\"\r\nmade it desirable that active operations should begin with as little\r\ndelay as possible, the naval measures to which Austria and Great\r\nBritain were pledged would be initiated at once, without waiting for\r\nthe ratification of the convention.[574]\r\n\r\nThe decision of the four Powers to conclude this treaty had not been\r\ncommunicated to M. Guizot. French historians have adduced the secrecy\r\nwhich was observed as a proof of Palmerston's malevolent intentions\r\ntowards France. But no other course could have been pursued with\r\nsafety. It was certain that France would not take part in coercing the\r\nPasha,[575] and it was no less certain that she would warn him of the\r\nmeasures which the allies were proposing to adopt against him.[576]\r\nInasmuch, therefore, as it was advisable that the naval commander in\r\nthe Mediterranean should receive his orders before Mehemet Ali could\r\nbe aware of the nature of the pressure which was to be brought to bear\r\nupon him, it was impossible to acquaint M. Guizot with the resolution\r\nof the Powers. Nor was the expediency of enabling the British fleet\r\nto forestall any hostile move on the part of the Pasha the only\r\nreason which made secrecy desirable. Although Palmerston was not\r\napprehensive that the French government would proceed to extremities,\r\nit was possible that M. Thiers might decide actively to support the\r\nPasha. In that case war could not be avoided and it was very necessary\r\nthat Sir Robert Stopford should receive the earliest information of\r\nthe intentions of his government. No communication, accordingly, was\r\nmade to the French ambassador until the couriers from London had\r\nobtained a start of forty-eight hours. But, on July 17, Palmerston\r\ninvited M. Guizot to call at the Foreign Office, where he read out\r\nto him a _memorandum_ acquainting him with the convention which had\r\nbeen concluded. The numerous efforts which had been made to induce\r\nFrance to co-operate with the other Powers were insisted upon, and\r\ngreat regret was expressed that she had not seen fit to comply with\r\nthe several proposals which had been communicated to her. Palmerston\r\nthen proceeded to explain the general nature of the measures of\r\ncoercion which it was intended to apply to Mehemet Ali, without,\r\nhowever, supplying the ambassador with a copy of the treaty. Guizot,\r\nafter disputing the accuracy of certain statements contained in the\r\n_memorandum_, took his departure. The situation was so grave that he\r\nmust receive instructions from his government before he could discuss\r\nit.[577]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n                       THE ISOLATION OF FRANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry Bulwer,[578] who during the absence of Lord Granville from\r\nParis was in charge of the embassy, was agreeably surprised at the\r\ncalmness with which M. Thiers received the news of the conclusion\r\nof the treaty. At their first interview, after the arrival of\r\nGuizot's despatch, he contented himself with expressing a pained\r\nastonishment that England should have treated her ally with so little\r\nconsideration. The affair would, he feared, arouse the greatest\r\nindignation throughout the country and, for the present, he must\r\nbeg him to observe the strictest secrecy about it.[579] A few days\r\nlater, in the course of a long and confidential conversation with\r\nLouis Philippe, Bulwer was enabled to judge of the King's opinion of\r\nthe situation. Adopting the contention, which Thiers was instructing\r\nGuizot to urge in his conferences with Palmerston, that no definite\r\nproposals for settling the eastern question had ever been made to the\r\nFrench government, Louis Philippe complained of the secret manner\r\nin which the treaty had been negotiated. \"Ah, Mr. Bulwer,\" said he,\r\n\"I know you wished to read me a lesson, I know it, but it may be a\r\nperilous one for all parties.\" Assuming a more confidential tone, the\r\nKing then proceeded to explain the difficulties by which he might\r\nbe confronted. It would not be easy, he feared or affected to fear,\r\nto maintain peace. Thiers, he had reason to believe, would wish him\r\nto go to war, and in that case he might be placed in a very delicate\r\nposition. \"How do you think I should stand,\" he asked plaintively,\r\n\"were Thiers at the head of a large parliamentary party to announce\r\nthat he had resigned, sooner than submit to the dishonour of France?\"\r\nIt was to be hoped that the coercion which the four Powers proposed\r\nto apply to Mehemet Ali would either at once prove effectual, or fail\r\ncompletely and be promptly abandoned. The sooner the affair could\r\nbe settled the better. For his part, only this was a circumstance\r\nwhich Bulwer must never disclose to M. Thiers, he had taken steps to\r\ninduce the Pasha to refrain from ordering Ibrahim to pass the Taurus\r\nmountains.[580] On August 3, before leaving Paris for the Château\r\nd'Eu, Louis Philippe discussed the situation in the same spirit with\r\nLord Granville.[581]\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of the Treaty of July 15 was announced in London on\r\nthe 25th, and two days later, the news was published in the Paris\r\npapers. The expectation of the King and of M. Thiers that it would\r\narouse a dangerous excitement was fully realized. The _bourse_ was\r\npanic-stricken and securities fell heavily. The Chambers were not\r\nsitting, but the press with one accord gave voice to the popular\r\nindignation. The decision of the four Powers to adopt, without\r\nconsultation with France, hostile measures against her _protégé_\r\nMehemet Ali, was denounced as a national insult which must be wiped\r\nout in blood. The tone of the _Constitutionel_, which was notoriously\r\ninspired by the President of the Council, was nearly as bellicose\r\nas that of the _National_, the organ of the republican and military\r\nparty. M. Thiers, if he did not actually encourage, certainly did\r\nnothing to allay, the excitement, which was increased, on August 1, by\r\nthe publication of a Royal ordinance decreeing substantial additions\r\nto both the army and the navy.\r\n\r\nIn London the affair only began to attract much public interest, when\r\nthe extent of the resentment which it had aroused in Paris became\r\nknown. The High Tories, who had always disliked the French alliance,\r\nwere delighted to think that that combination was at an end. The more\r\nmoderate members of the party, however, who followed the leadership\r\nof Wellington, Peel and Aberdeen, whilst agreeing as to the necessity\r\nof driving Mehemet Ali from Syria, regretted that means had not been\r\nfound of inducing France to adhere to the treaty. _The Times_,[582]\r\nwhich was very antagonistic to Palmerston, supplied its readers, on\r\nAugust 3, with an article by Henry Reeve in which he expressed a\r\nsincere hope that relations with France \"would not be imperilled for\r\nthe sake of a desperado like Mehemet Ali,\" and, at the same time,\r\nsuggested that throughout the negotiations the Foreign Office had not\r\nimprobably been the dupe of Russia. The Radicals adopted this view,\r\nand furthermore, deprecated any intervention in Turkish affairs.\r\nIt was only in their quarter of the House that the policy of the\r\ngovernment encountered any real hostility. But even their attack was\r\nnot pressed with much spirit, and Palmerston, on August 6, a few days\r\nbefore the prorogation of Parliament, had no difficulty in repelling\r\nJoseph Hume's allegation that the insurrection in the Lebanon had been\r\nfomented by British agents.[583]\r\n\r\nGuizot, in the meanwhile, had had several conferences at the Foreign\r\nOffice, and had discussed the situation with both Melbourne and\r\nJohn Russell. The position which the French government intended to\r\nassume was set forth in a _memorandum_ which he was instructed to\r\nread to Lord Palmerston. No formal proposals for a treaty, M. Thiers\r\ncontended, had ever been made to France. Various suggestions, it was\r\ntrue, for settling the Turco-Egyptian question had been put forward,\r\nwith none of which she had been able to agree. She had always looked\r\nupon Mehemet Ali as an integral part of the Ottoman Empire, and\r\nconsidered his strength as necessary to the preservation of Turkey.\r\nHence she had constantly opposed the idea of wresting Syria from him\r\nby force, and she was now disposed to think that the four Powers\r\nhad scarcely realized the magnitude of the task upon which they had\r\nembarked so light-heartedly. \"Treat Lord Palmerston,\" wrote M. Thiers,\r\n\"as he treated you. Read out to him this written declaration. Question\r\nhim boldly. Ask him whether he has any plans for helping the rising\r\nin Syria, and what measures he proposes to adopt should the Pasha\r\nreturn a flat refusal to the Sultan's demands? Press him hard. Place\r\nhim in the position of having to confess that he has acted in a very\r\nfoolhardy fashion. . . . Be careful, however, to frame your questions\r\nin such a way that, should he decline to answer them, you are not\r\ncompelled to announce a rupture of relations. For the moment France\r\nmust restrain herself.\"[584]\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to suppose that Guizot displayed any lack of skill\r\nin the performance of his prescribed task. He was, however, unable\r\nto report that he had achieved the smallest measure of success.\r\nPalmerston, whilst expressing his deep regret that a divergence of\r\nopinion should have alienated the two Cabinets, and admitting the\r\nhope, which Guizot himself was convinced was sincere, that their\r\nseparation would be of brief duration, was clearly determined to carry\r\nout the treaty to the letter. As regards the military situation in\r\nSyria--the point upon which M. Thiers laid the greatest stress--he\r\nwas full of confidence. Ibrahim, surrounded by a hostile population\r\nand deprived of communication by sea with Egypt, would, he felt\r\ncertain, be reduced to impotence. Melbourne, however, displayed\r\nfar less confidence, and the Austrian and the Prussian ministers,\r\nwith whom Guizot also conversed, adopted an almost apologetic tone.\r\nIndeed, throughout this affair, it would seem that the appellation of\r\n\"time-serving dog\" applied by Charles Greville to Neumann might with\r\nequal justice have been applied to Bülow, his Prussian colleague.[585]\r\n\r\nWhilst news from the East was eagerly awaited Guizot was summoned\r\nto the Château d'Eu, where he would be enabled to confer with both\r\nthe King and M. Thiers. From the subsequent proceedings of the chief\r\nactors in these transactions, as well as from the somewhat meagre\r\naccount of his visit which M. Guizot has given in his _Mémoires_,\r\nit is not difficult to surmise the nature of the plan which it was\r\nresolved to adopt. France was to arm upon an imposing scale, and her\r\nrepresentatives at the different Courts were to assume an attitude of\r\ndignified resentment. Such a course possessed a twofold advantage.\r\nAbroad, it could not fail to have a great effect upon the timid\r\nCabinets of Vienna and Berlin, and might even incline them to withhold\r\ntheir ratification of the treaty. At home, warlike preparations would\r\nbe popular, and might prevent people from enquiring too closely into\r\nthe policy which had resulted in the isolation of France. Moreover, M.\r\nThiers was glad of the opportunity, which the crisis afforded him,\r\nof strengthening the army and of repairing the effect of many yeas of\r\nmilitary neglect.\r\n\r\nBut, although the King and his minister were thus resolved to show\r\na menacing front to Europe, Guizot was supplied with confidential\r\ninstructions of a most pacific character. Palmerston, they were\r\nconvinced, had grossly miscalculated the strength of Mehemet Ali,\r\nand it was to be hoped that the unexpected difficulties which the\r\nexecution of the treaty could not fail to encounter would produce a\r\ngreat revulsion of feeling, not only at the continental Courts, but\r\namong the majority of the members of the British Cabinet. Should,\r\ntherefore, M. Guizot perceive signs of a disposition to adopt a less\r\nuncompromising attitude towards Mehemet Ali and to draw nearer to\r\nFrance, he was to encourage it by all means in his power. Provided\r\nthe Treaty of July 15 could be declared to be at an end, the French\r\ngovernment would gladly join with the Powers in guaranteeing\r\nthe integrity of Turkey, on the basis of the maintenance of the\r\nconditions of the Convention of Kiutayeh. M. Thiers, it will be\r\nseen, was thus ready to consent to restrict Mehemet Ali to the life\r\ngovernment of both Syria and Egypt, a state of affairs to which he\r\nhad always declared that it was useless to expect him to submit. As\r\nan alternative to this solution of the difficulty, France might be\r\ninvited to mediate on behalf of the Pasha with the allied Powers. In\r\nthat case the hereditary tenure of Egypt and the life government of\r\nSyria for Mehemet Ali would be the basis of the negotiation.[586]\r\nThis was another arrangement which a few weeks before M. Thiers had\r\nrejected as altogether inadmissible. The Comte Walewski, a natural son\r\nof Napoleon, who had been sent upon a special mission to Egypt, on\r\nAugust 2, for the purpose of counselling the Pasha to refrain from\r\nbeginning hostilities, was, accordingly, instructed to suggest to\r\nMehemet Ali that he should defer his dispute with the four Powers and\r\nthe Porte to the mediation of France.\r\n\r\nBut in addition to these instructions Guizot carried back with him to\r\nLondon a letter from Louis Philippe to his son-in-law, the King of\r\nthe Belgians. Leopold was at Windsor Castle, consumed with anxiety\r\nat the thought of the dangers to which a European war must expose\r\nhis newly established Kingdom. Louis Philippe's letter of August 13\r\nwas plainly intended to be read by Queen Victoria, and was drawn up\r\nwith the object of seriously alarming her, and of prejudicing her\r\nagainst Palmerston. \"The situation in which France finds herself,\"\r\nwrote the King, \"is neither of her choice nor of her creation. It\r\nwas said of the death of the Duc d'Enghien that it was worse than a\r\ncrime, it was a blunder. I say now of the Treaty of July 15, that it\r\nis worse than a blunder, it is a misfortune of which the consequences\r\nare incalculable. The situation is particularly painful for me who\r\nhave always scouted the notion that England could ever enter into\r\nan alliance without France. I find I am wrong. For the present we\r\ncan only wait and see. But there is one thing we must do and that is\r\nto arm, and we are doing so vigorously. Our _rôle_ must be one of\r\nexpectation. We must see what England means to do, before deciding\r\nwhat France shall do, either in the way of restoring or preserving the\r\nbalance of power.\"[587]\r\n\r\nA few hours before M. Guizot departed from England to visit the King\r\nat Eu, a steamer left the Thames having on board Louis Napoleon, who,\r\nwith some fifty followers, a tame eagle and a bundle of proclamations,\r\npurposed to overthrow the Orleans Monarchy. His destination was\r\nBoulogne, where a subaltern officer of the garrison had been drawn\r\ninto the plot. On the morning of August 6, the Imperial Pretender\r\ndisembarked at Vimereux and presented himself before the 42nd regiment\r\nupon the barrack square. But his appearance aroused no enthusiasm.\r\nFinding that their plans had miscarried, the conspirators attempted\r\nto regain their ship. Their flight was, however, intercepted by the\r\npolice and the national guards, who captured the whole party and\r\nlodged them in the gaol. Four years before Louis Napoleon had made\r\na similar attempt at Strasburg. On that occasion he had not been\r\nbrought to trial, but had simply been placed on board a ship and sent\r\noff to America. This second offence, however, could not be treated\r\nwith the same leniency. On September 28, he was arraigned before the\r\npeers and sentenced to perpetual imprisonment in the fortress of Ham.\r\nThe affair excited little public interest and was generally treated\r\nwith contemptuous indifference. Certain French newspapers, however,\r\npublished accounts of meetings between the Pretender and Palmerston,\r\nand declared that his attempt must have been connived at by the\r\nBritish government. But at his first interview with Baron Bourqueney,\r\nwho had come over to London to take charge of the embassy during the\r\nabsence of Guizot, Palmerston was enabled to pledge his word of honour\r\nthat, for \"the past two years, neither he nor Lord Melbourne had set\r\neyes upon Louis Bonaparte or upon any of the adventurers by whom he\r\nwas surrounded.\"[588] His assurance was readily accepted and the\r\nmatter was quickly forgotten.\r\n\r\nUpon his return to London, Guizot found awaiting him an invitation to\r\nWindsor. Among the party at the Castle were the King of the Belgians,\r\nMelbourne, Palmerston, and Wellington. Leopold, to whom Guizot at\r\nonce delivered Louis Philippe's letter, applied himself diligently to\r\nthe task of extricating his father-in-law from his difficulties. With\r\nthe view of terminating the isolation in which France was placed, he\r\nproposed that the convention of the four Powers for the pacification\r\nof the Levant should be merged in a larger instrument, to which she\r\nmight be a party. But Palmerston, with whom he had a long conference,\r\nwhilst acknowledging the advantages to be derived from a general\r\nagreement to uphold the integrity of Turkey, declared emphatically\r\nthat no plan of that kind could be considered, until the Treaty of\r\nJuly 15 should have been executed in all its details. On August 20, at\r\nthe termination of his visit, Guizot carried back with him to London\r\nthe conviction that Leopold's efforts had in no way modified the\r\nsituation. He had, however, been able to derive some small consolation\r\nfrom the evident desire of the Queen and of Prince Albert to treat him\r\nwith unusual consideration, whilst he had noted with satisfaction that\r\nMelbourne had appeared depressed and even Palmerston seemed out of\r\nspirits.[589]\r\n\r\nFrom the French point of view the news from Syria was of a distinctly\r\nreassuring character. The insurrection in the Lebanon, upon the wide\r\ndevelopment of which Palmerston was supposed to have confidently\r\ndepended for the realization of his plans, had been suppressed without\r\ndifficulty by Ibrahim Pasha. This circumstance, combined with the\r\nefforts of King Leopold, revived the active opposition of those of\r\nPalmerston's colleagues who disapproved of his eastern policy. They\r\nurged, accordingly, the expediency of making some friendly advances\r\ntowards France. Palmerston consented with an unexpected alacrity\r\nto meet their wishes. He had not answered Thiers' _memorandum_ of\r\nJuly 21, and he now proposed that he should reply to it and thus\r\nre-open communications with the French government. But his long\r\ndespatch of August 31, was scarcely so conciliatory as some of his\r\nfellow-ministers would have desired. It was in effect an amplification\r\nof the _memorandum_ which, on July 17, he had read out and handed to\r\nM. Guizot. It gave a luminous account of the negotiations and set\r\nforth the British case with admirable clearness, but only in the\r\nconcluding paragraphs was a vague hope expressed that, after the\r\ncomplete execution of the Treaty of July 15, France would once more\r\nresume her place in \"the union of the five Powers.\"[590] The document\r\nwas intended for publication and, in drawing it up, Palmerston had\r\nbeen more concerned to convince his countrymen of the justice of his\r\ncause than to conciliate the French government. As the event was to\r\nprove, he had judged correctly in supposing that a lucid exposition\r\nof his policy would greatly strengthen his hand, and enable him to\r\ncounteract the intrigues of the French party, in the Cabinet. When,\r\nabout a month later, his despatch was communicated to the press, it\r\nsilenced the opposition of all fair-minded persons.[591] Guizot,\r\nsuspecting at once the real object which Palmerston had in view, lost\r\nno time in urging upon Thiers the necessity of presenting, no less\r\nskilfully, the French case to the public.[592]\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of the Treaty of July 15 was known at Constantinople\r\non August 3. The Porte, acting under the advice of the ambassadors\r\nof the four Powers, proceeded without loss of time to carry out its\r\nconditions. Rifat Bey, accompanied by Mr. Alison of the British\r\nembassy, was despatched to Egypt with the Sultan's _ultimatum_, and\r\nmeasures were promptly taken for rendering effective aid to the\r\nSyrian insurgents.[593] At the same time as the documents relating\r\nto the treaty were sent to Constantinople, the instructions of the\r\nAdmiralty were forwarded to Sir Robert Stopford, commanding the\r\nBritish Mediterranean Squadron. All communication by sea was to be\r\ncut off between Egypt and Syria. If the Pasha's fleet should be\r\ndiscovered within the harbour of Alexandria, it was not to be allowed\r\nto leave. Should an Egyptian squadron be cruising off the Syrian\r\ncoast, the admiral was to use his own discretion as to the means to be\r\nemployed for carrying out the intentions of his government. Peaceful\r\npersuasion was to be tried in the first instance, but, should it\r\nprove ineffectual, force must be resorted to without hesitation. Five\r\nthousand stands of arms from the stores at Malta were placed at his\r\ndisposal, for distribution among the insurgent mountaineers. Lastly,\r\nStopford was warned to be on his guard against \"any sudden movement\r\nof the French squadron, in consequence of orders which might be sent\r\nfrom Paris, under the first impulse of irritation which the French\r\ngovernment would naturally feel at finding itself placed in a separate\r\nand isolated position.\"[594]\r\n\r\nThe French naval force in the Mediterranean was at this time extremely\r\nefficient[595] and, in point of numbers, slightly superior to the\r\nBritish. Ever since the beginning of the year, Palmerston had made the\r\nstrength of the Toulon fleet the subject of numerous representations\r\nto the French government.[596] Should, therefore, warlike counsels\r\nprevail in Paris the initial advantages of the naval situation would\r\nbe on the side of France. But, as early as July 25, Palmerston was so\r\nsatisfied that no danger of that kind was to be apprehended, that he\r\ndesired that Stopford should be informed that the French government\r\nhad clearly \"no intention of opposing by force the measures which\r\nthe allies had resolved to execute.\"[597] That officer, on receipt\r\nof his instructions, had proceeded to Alexandria, both to support by\r\nhis presence the demands which Rifat Bey was pressing upon the Pasha\r\nand to prevent the egress of the Egyptian fleet. A few days before\r\nhis arrival, the squadron, which Mehemet Ali had recently sent to the\r\ncoast of Syria,[598] had hastily returned to Alexandria, upon the\r\nadvice, as it was believed, of the French admiral.\r\n\r\nWhilst he was in these waters, Stopford was joined by Admiral Bandiera\r\nwith two Austrian frigates, one of which was commanded by the\r\nArchduke Charles Frederick. Commodore Charles Napier, famous for his\r\ndestruction of the Miguelite Meet, had at the same time been detached\r\nto the coast of Syria with five sail of the line and some smaller\r\nvessels. Arriving off Beyrout, on August 12, Napier found that the\r\ninsurrection, which he had been informed was in full progress, had\r\nbeen suppressed. Nevertheless, two days later, he took up a position\r\n\"abreast of the town\" and sent an officer on shore to notify to the\r\ngovernor that the four Powers had decided to restore Syria to the\r\nSultan, and to demand that the arms taken from the inhabitants of\r\nthe Lebanon should be restored to them. Furthermore, he issued a\r\nproclamation calling upon the Syrians to return to their allegiance to\r\nthe Sultan, and proceeded to detain a number of small vessels carrying\r\nprovisions and military stores for the use of Ibrahim's army. But, as\r\nthe twenty days allowed Mehemet Ali for considering the demands of\r\nthe Porte had not yet expired, he did not consider himself justified\r\nin beginning actual hostilities. Finding, therefore, that Soliman\r\nPasha[599] was not disposed to comply with his summons and that his\r\nproclamation produced no effect, he withdrew his squadron to a better\r\nanchorage and employed his time in reconnoitring the coast.[600]\r\n\r\nM. de Pontois, the French ambassador to the Sublime Porte, had, in\r\nthe meanwhile, not been idle. On August 16, on receipt presumably of\r\ninstructions from M. Thiers, he sent his _dragoman_ to Reshid Pasha,\r\nthe Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs. The message, of which M.\r\nCor was the bearer, was to the effect that France was deeply offended\r\nat the action of the Ottoman plenipotentiary in signing the Treaty of\r\nJuly 15, and that she was resolved to support Mehemet Ali and actively\r\nto oppose the measures of coercion which the allies were proposing\r\nto apply to him.[601] M. de Pontois himself further declared to the\r\nRussian minister that he regarded war between France and England\r\nas inevitable. This threatening language was at once reported by\r\nthe representatives of the Powers to their respective Courts and\r\nLord Ponsonby, at the same time, sent to warn the British admirals\r\nthat an outbreak of hostilities with France was to be seriously\r\napprehended.[602] A few days later, however, the French ambassador,\r\nwhether in consequence of fresh instructions from Paris, or whether\r\nbecause on considering the matter he was afraid he had said too much,\r\nsaw fit to disavow the language imputed to him.[603] This was the\r\nattitude adopted by M. Thiers when, in due course, representations\r\non the subject of M. de Pontois' menaces were made to him by the\r\nPowers. The full brunt of his ill-humour fell, as was usual, upon\r\nthe Austrian ambassador, who met with a very warm and disagreeable\r\nreception. \"_Vous pouvez dire à Reshid Pasha qu'il en a menti,_\"[604]\r\nwas the only statement which Apponyi could extract from him. Guizot,\r\nbut in more courteous terms, conveyed the same explanation to Lord\r\nPalmerston. No written communication having passed between M. de\r\nPontois and Reshid Pasha, the matter was allowed to drop.[605] It was\r\nevident that whatever might have been the precise words used by M.\r\nCor, the message of the French ambassador to the _Reis-Effendi_ was\r\na rather clumsy attempt to frighten the Sultan into withholding his\r\nratification of the treaty.\r\n\r\nFrance meanwhile was arming in most ostentatious fashion. On September\r\n13 the fortification of Paris was decreed by a Royal ordinance. This\r\nwas a measure which had been under consideration for some time past,\r\nbut which had always been set aside on account of the difficulty\r\nof inducing the Chambers to consent to the required expenditure.\r\nThiers, as a student of the campaign of 1814, had constantly advocated\r\nit, whilst Louis Philippe was also in favour of it because, as\r\nwas generally believed, he hoped that a circle of forts round the\r\ncapital would greatly facilitate the suppression of any revolutionary\r\nmovement. M. Thiers gave his closest personal attention to the\r\nmilitary preparations. With the journalists and stock-jobbers, by whom\r\nhe was surrounded,[606] his conversation turned on war unceasingly. In\r\nthe early days of August he had hinted at a campaign upon the Rhine,\r\nwhilst the papers which he inspired denounced the treaties of 1815 and\r\ntalked of \"natural frontiers.\" But his thoughts soon assumed a new\r\ndirection. The _débordement_,[607] when it came, would be in Italy,\r\nwhere Austria was to be assailed at her most vulnerable point. Lying\r\non the floor, with his maps spread out before him, like the great\r\nman about whom he had written so much, he planned vast military and\r\ndiplomatic combinations.[608]\r\n\r\nNor was Louis Philippe less warlike than his minister. All Paris heard\r\nof the indignant and threatening language which he had used to the\r\nPrussian and Austrian ambassadors. Taking them aside at the Tuileries,\r\nhe had bitterly reproached them for the ingratitude which their Courts\r\nhad displayed towards him. For ten years he had held the revolution in\r\ncheck and his reward had been the Quadrilateral Treaty of July. But,\r\nand at this point his voice could be heard far beyond the confines\r\nof the room in which the interview took place, \"they had better not\r\nprovoke him too far. He had discarded the red cap. Some day, perhaps,\r\nthey might be disagreeably surprised to find that he had resumed\r\nit.\"[609] This threat, which was uttered as though it had escaped him\r\nin the heat of passion, was well calculated to give Metternich much\r\ncause for uneasy reflection. At the same time the King's eldest son,\r\nthe Duc d'Orléans, a keen and ambitious soldier, loudly proclaimed\r\nthat France had been insulted. With perfect sincerity he declared his\r\nbelief in the necessity of war. \"If the worst came to the worst,\" he\r\ntold his friends, \"he had rather be killed in action upon the Rhine,\r\nthan be shot in a street fight and die in the gutter.\"[610]\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of the revolutionary recollections evoked by\r\nthe anti-dynastic press, and of the threats of war to be waged upon\r\nJacobinical principles,[611] indulged in by the organs of M. Thiers,\r\npublic excitement in Paris rose to an alarming pitch. The situation\r\nwas complicated by a series of strikes in different trades. Bands\r\nof men deprived of their employment marched through the streets\r\nsinging the _Marseillaise_. The secret republican societies fomented\r\nthe discontent of the working classes and fanned the flame of war.\r\nDisturbances took place, and the authorities were apprehensive of an\r\nattack by the mob upon the British embassy.\r\n\r\nTowards the middle of September the news reached Paris that, in\r\nconsequence of the Sultan's demands, conveyed to him by Rifat Bey,\r\nMehemet Ali had invoked the protection and mediation of France.[612]\r\nFurthermore, at the instance of the Comte Walewski, he had declared\r\nhis readiness to restore to the Sultan the island of Crete, the Holy\r\nCities and the province of Adana. Although maintaining his claim to\r\nthe hereditary tenure of Egypt, he had announced that he would be\r\nsatisfied, as regards Syria, were the government of Tripoli, Damascus\r\nand Aleppo to be conferred upon his son Ibrahim for his life. Thiers\r\nperceived, at once, that in these proposals lay his last chance of\r\npreventing without war the full execution of the Treaty of July 15.\r\nNotwithstanding that he still derided the notion that a blockade of\r\nthe coast would suffice to make Mehemet Ali relax his hold upon Syria,\r\nin his heart he was, doubtless, beginning to suspect that he had\r\noverestimated the military power of the Pasha. Napier's proceedings at\r\nBeyrout and his detention of the Egyptian store ships and transports\r\nhad not been followed by that vigorous offensive, which, he had\r\nalways predicted, Ibrahim would assume the moment any act of war was\r\ncommitted against him.\r\n\r\nHitherto M. Thiers, in his intercourse with the British _chargé\r\nd'affaires_, with whom he was in private life on very friendly terms,\r\nhad never made use of those asperities of language and warlike threats\r\nwhich he had sometimes indulged in with Werther and Apponyi. But,\r\non the morning of September 18, when Mr. Bulwer called upon him,\r\nhe resolved to adopt new tactics. As they paced up and down a long\r\ngallery in his house at Auteuil, M. Thiers declared emphatically that\r\nhe considered the Pasha's last proposals both just and reasonable. If\r\nEngland would agree to join with France in pressing their acceptance\r\nupon the Porte and the Powers, there would once more be established\r\nthe intimate relations between the two governments which the\r\nQuadrilateral Treaty had interrupted. But if not, then seeing that\r\nMehemet Ali had made these concessions at the instance of France, she\r\nwould \"be bound to support him.\" As he concluded he looked Bulwer full\r\nin the face and asked him whether he realized the full import of these\r\nwords. \"Perfectly,\" replied he imperturbably, \"you mean to declare for\r\nthe Pasha and go to war with us in his favour.\" Before they parted,\r\nhowever, M. Thiers somewhat modified the gravity of his statement,\r\nby saying that he had spoken as a private individual, not as the\r\nPresident of the Council.\r\n\r\nA few hours later Bulwer returned to Auteuil. Before leaving M. Thiers\r\nhe had told him that he would like him to see the account of their\r\nconversation which he proposed to send to London. The despatch which\r\nhe, accordingly, placed in his hands began by stating that, in the\r\nwriter's opinion, the moment had come when M. Thiers purposed saying\r\nto the King, \"You must follow me even to war, or I will leave you\r\nexposed to public opinion as expressed by the newspapers.\" It was\r\ncertain, however, that the King would not accept such a programme,\r\nand that, were M. Thiers to place his resignation on those grounds,\r\nit would be unhesitatingly accepted. This was very far from the kind\r\nof message which Thiers wished conveyed to Lord Palmerston. \"My dear\r\nBulwer,\" he said, \"you are greatly mistaken, you will ruin your\r\npromising career. The King is far more warlike than I am.\"[613] Bulwer\r\nsaw no occasion to argue that point, and, having produced the desired\r\neffect, he readily agreed merely to relate to his chief the substance\r\nof their morning's conversation. In a private and confidential\r\ndespatch, however, he stated that this interview had left a strong\r\nimpression upon his mind that M. Thiers had, in reality, an earnest\r\ndesire to maintain peace.[614]\r\n\r\nThese so-called concessions of Mehemet Ali were, Lord Palmerston\r\ndeclared, unworthy of serious consideration. Whether Syria were\r\ngoverned by Ibrahim or by Mehemet Ali was a matter of very little\r\nimportance. The object with which the treaty had been concluded must\r\nbe relentlessly pursued. Syria must be replaced under the direct rule\r\nof the Porte. Until the Egyptian desert should intervene between the\r\nterritories of the Sultan and those administered by his too-powerful\r\nvassal, there could be no permanent peace in the East. No arguments of\r\nM. Guizot could induce him to adopt a less uncompromising attitude.\r\nThe Pasha's proposals indicated, he maintained, that he already\r\nperceived the necessity of bowing to the inevitable, and that he\r\nwould, before long, yield to all the demands of the Powers.[615]\r\nCertain of his colleagues, however, altogether dissented from this\r\nview of the case. Mehemet Ali's concessions, they contended, had\r\ncreated an opportunity for terminating the differences with France and\r\nfor drawing her into the negotiations.\r\n\r\nThe French party in the Cabinet had recently received a great\r\naccession of strength. Lord John Russell, the Colonial Secretary\r\nand the leader of the House of Commons, had cordially approved\r\nof the Treaty of July 15. Nevertheless, early in September, he\r\nappears to have been seized with grave misgivings as to the wisdom\r\nof carrying out its provisions. A letter from Lord Spencer to his\r\nbrother the Duke of Bedford, expressing the fear that Palmerston's\r\npolicy would lead to a war with France, seems to have made a great\r\nimpression upon him.[616] Moreover, \"Bear\" Ellice[617] was actively\r\nengaged in propagating alarmist rumours and in discoursing upon the\r\nindignation which the Anglo-Russian alliance had aroused in France.\r\nThere are grounds for believing that the intrigue, of which he was\r\nthe soul, aimed at driving Palmerston to resign, in order that\r\nClarendon might replace him at the Foreign Office.[618] Be that\r\nas it may, the inspiration of M. Thiers can plainly be discerned\r\nin the correspondence of Mr. Ellice with both Russell and with\r\nMelbourne.[619] Charles Greville also appears to have spent much time\r\nwith Guizot in inveighing against the presumptuous recklessness of\r\nPalmerston and in discussing the votes and opinions of different\r\nmembers of the Cabinet.[620] But the French ambassador could listen to\r\neven more congenial sentiments in the social circle presided over by\r\nLord and Lady Holland. M. Thiers, a few weeks after Holland's death,\r\nopenly declared in the Chamber that, throughout this crisis, he had\r\nalways been able to depend upon the support of that statesman.[621]\r\nIt is impossible to say how far he was justified in making such a\r\nstatement. It is undeniable, however, that matters, which should have\r\nbeen treated as Cabinet secrets, were known in Paris. In commenting\r\nupon M. Thiers' amazing indiscretion, _The Times_,[622] which cannot\r\nbe charged with partiality to Palmerston, positively asserted, as\r\na notorious fact, that \"every transaction within the doors of the\r\nBritish council-chamber were as well known upon the _bourse_ as in\r\nthe deepest recesses of Downing Street or Whitehall.\" This statement\r\nis to a great extent confirmed by Bulwer, who relates that, in\r\nconsequence of certain information which he had acquired in Paris, he\r\nwas enabled to warn Palmerston of an attack which was to be made upon\r\nhim in the Cabinet.[623] \"The talking at Holland House,\" wrote Lord\r\nMelbourne, \"is irremediable. They cannot help it, and they are not\r\nthemselves aware how much they talk.\"[624] It was always a subject of\r\ncomplaint against Palmerston that he would come to important decisions\r\nand would embark upon grave measures of policy, without reference\r\nto his colleagues. The conduct of certain of his \"Whig friends\r\nand grandees\"[625] upon this occasion was, it must be admitted,\r\ncalculated to dispose him to confide in them as seldom as possible.\r\n\r\nNegotiations, John Russell insisted, must be opened with France on the\r\nbasis of the Pasha's last proposals. If this course were not adopted,\r\nhe announced his intention of retiring from office. His resolution\r\nwas not to be shaken either by the remonstrances of Melbourne that\r\nhis resignation must destroy the government, or by Palmerston's\r\nrepresentations that his present conduct was inconsistent with his\r\nformer approval of the treaty.[626] The French party seemed to be on\r\nthe point of triumphing. Palmerston appeared to be placed between two\r\nalternatives--he must either retire, or consent to suspend coercive\r\nmeasures against Mehemet Ali and make conciliatory advances to France.\r\nNevertheless, contrary to expectations, a crisis was averted. Lord\r\nJohn agreed greatly to modify his demands and Palmerston consented to\r\na slight compromise. \"Russell,\" records Greville, \"has disappointed\r\nme. He is not the man I took him for.\"[627] But in point of fact an\r\ninfluence, unsuspected by Greville, had been brought to bear upon\r\nhim. Melbourne had conveyed to him a message from the Queen that she\r\nwas not in a condition[628] to bear, without danger, the anxiety to\r\nwhich she must be subjected by the course he threatened to pursue.\r\nBut Her Majesty placed her chief objection to anything in the nature\r\nof a Cabinet crisis, at this particular moment, on other grounds than\r\nthose of her own state of health. She desired Lord John to reflect\r\nmost seriously upon the injury, which the country must suffer in the\r\neyes of foreign Powers, from so public an exhibition of ministerial\r\nweakness and vacillation at a time of national emergency.[629]\r\n\r\nMetternich had been greatly alarmed by the threatening aspect of\r\naffairs, and had, some weeks before, submitted a paper to King\r\nLeopold, for transmission to Louis Philippe, defining the attitude\r\nwhich, in his opinion, the French government should adopt. Whilst\r\nsignifying her dissent from the policy of coercing Mehemet Ali, she\r\nmight, he suggested, declare her adherence to the main principle of\r\nthe treaty--the necessity of preserving the integrity of Turkey.\r\nShould the event prove that the Pasha was not to be subdued by force,\r\nshe might announce her readiness to discuss with the Powers the means\r\nby which, in the future, the security of the Ottoman Empire might\r\nbe maintained.[630] Palmerston, who was in possession of a copy of\r\nthis document, expressed himself as willing to make an overture to\r\nthe French government on the basis of Metternich's suggestions. At\r\na Cabinet Council, on October 1, this solution of the difficulty\r\nwas agreed to unanimously.[631] It was a small concession which\r\nPalmerston could well afford to make. Before the French government\r\ncould be approached on the subject, the consent of the Powers, which\r\nwere parties to the Quadrilateral Treaty, would have to be obtained.\r\nBrunnow, without doubt, would at once declare that he must refer the\r\nmatter to his Court, and long before an answer could be received\r\nfrom St. Petersburg, the guns would have spoken in the East and the\r\nwhole situation would be altered. Nor was this expectation falsified.\r\nThe representatives of the Powers, following the lead of Brunnow,\r\nannounced that they were without instructions and must submit the\r\nproposal to their Courts. But already the news had arrived of the\r\nsuccess with which hostilities had been opened in Syria.[632]\r\n\r\nAt Constantinople Mehemet Ali's reply to the demands made to him\r\nby Rifat Bey was held to be unsatisfactory, and, with the full\r\napproval of the ambassadors of the allied Powers, the Porte decided\r\nto treat his counter-proposals in the light of a rejection of the\r\nSultan's _ultimatum_. He was, accordingly, declared deposed from the\r\ngovernorship of Egypt and of the other territories which he ruled, and\r\na blockade was proclaimed both of the Syrian and Egyptian coasts. The\r\nrepresentatives of the Powers at the same time recalled the consuls\r\nfrom Alexandria, and every effort was made to carry out promptly the\r\nstipulations of the Treaty of July 15.[633] Sir Robert Stopford,\r\nleaving a portion of his command to watch the Egyptian fleet, sailed\r\nwith the remainder of his force and the Austrian squadron to join\r\nNapier off Beyrout, where Captain Walker, who had been placed in\r\ncommand of the Turkish fleet, had already arrived. On September\r\n11, the governor of Beyrout having been ineffectually summoned to\r\nsurrender, fire was opened upon the forts. After sustaining a heavy\r\nbombardment, Soliman Pasha withdrew the garrison into the hills.\r\nTwo days before, a Turkish division and detachments of British and\r\nAustrian marines had landed at Jounié Bay. Commodore Napier, under\r\nwhose direction these operations were carried out, entrenched his\r\nforce securely and proceeded to distribute arms and ammunition to the\r\nmountaineers, who flocked into his camp in large numbers. Meanwhile,\r\nIbrahim, who with the main Egyptian army was not far distant, looked\r\non helplessly, and appeared to be incapable of offering any serious\r\nresistance to the operations of the allies.[634]\r\n\r\nThe news from the East created a profound sensation in Paris. \"The\r\ncannon of Beyrout,\" wrote Heine,[635] \"re-echoes painfully in the\r\nheart of every Frenchman.\" Young men eagerly proffered their services\r\nat the recruiting offices. At the opera and at the theatres excited\r\naudiences insisted on singing the _Marseillaise_. On the question of\r\npeace or war the Cabinet was supposed to be nearly equally divided.\r\nM. Thiers was reported to have urged the necessity of energetic\r\naction, but it was notorious that General Cubières, the Minister of\r\nWar, and Roussin, the Minister of Marine and the former ambassador\r\nat Constantinople, were in favour of pacific measures. Henry Reeve,\r\nthe friend of Greville and the future editor of his famous journals,\r\nwas at this time in Paris. Politically he was in complete accord with\r\nLord Holland and the French party, and, during his stay in Paris,\r\nwas in regular correspondence with Lord Lansdowne, a member of the\r\nMelbourne Cabinet, who, although not actively opposed to Palmerston,\r\nonly gave him a half-hearted support. Reeve was well acquainted with\r\nmost of the French ministers, and was on very friendly terms with\r\nLéon Faucher and several other prominent journalists and politicians.\r\nIn fact, during these critical days, he may be said, in his own\r\nwords, \"to have had his board and lodging in the Cabinet.\" He was\r\nin constant communication with M. Thiers, \"who was everything that\r\nhe could wish.\"[636] Consequently, he would ingenuously convey to\r\nhis patron[637] those opinions, which the crafty French minister\r\nconsidered might with advantage be disseminated in governmental\r\ncircles in London.\r\n\r\nAmidst all this excitement, whilst in Paris the _bourse_ was panic\r\nstricken and in London the funds were falling, Palmerston remained\r\nperfectly calm. He had never believed in the danger of a conflict\r\nwith France, and, in his opinion, the progress of events in the East\r\nhad rendered still more remote the chances of war.[638] He could not\r\nadmit that the French people or the French King would ever allow any\r\ngovernment to embark upon hostilities with the whole of Europe, in\r\norder to preserve Syria for Mehemet Ali. He wrote reassuringly to the\r\nQueen[639] to this effect, and strove to calm the apprehensions of his\r\ncolleagues and to instil into them some of his robust common sense.\r\nBut the edict of the Porte, by which Mehemet Ali had been deprived\r\nof the government of Egypt, had once more stirred his opponents to\r\naction. According to Lord John Russell, it was a measure which had\r\nnever been contemplated by the treaty and had clearly been adopted\r\nin consequence of the violent counsels of Lord Ponsonby. Palmerston,\r\nalthough he personally approved of the deposition of the Pasha, had,\r\nnevertheless, immediately instructed Granville to inform M. Thiers\r\nthat it was merely a measure of coercion, and was not intended to\r\nprejudge any arrangement which the Sultan might, hereafter, be\r\ndisposed to make in favour of Mehemet Ali, should he, \"at an early\r\nmoment, accept the conditions of the treaty.\"[640] Lord John, however,\r\nwas not to be pacified. War, he asserted, appeared to be imminent,\r\nand he insisted upon the necessity of holding a meeting of the\r\nCabinet.[641] Grave consequences, wrote Melbourne to the Queen, were\r\nto be apprehended from the Council which he had called for October\r\n10.[642]\r\n\r\nBut once again a crisis was averted. On the morning of the day on\r\nwhich the meeting of the Cabinet was to take place, Guizot presented\r\nhimself at the Foreign Office with two despatches from M. Thiers. The\r\nfirst, dated October 3, purported to be an answer to Lord Palmerston's\r\ndespatch of August 31. It was a long and rambling statement of the\r\nFrench case. The chief argument consisted in an attempt to show that\r\nFrance, throughout the negotiations, had never departed from the\r\nprinciple embodied in the _collective note of July 27, 1839_. Then,\r\nas now, France considered that that instrument had been drawn up for\r\nthe purpose of guaranteeing the independence and integrity of Turkey.\r\nShe had always believed that the object which it had in view was to\r\nenable the Sultan to escape from the exclusive protection of a certain\r\ngreat Power. She had never understood that the policy of preserving\r\nthe Ottoman Empire was bound up with any question of \"territorial\r\nlimitations, more or less advantageous, between the Sultan and the\r\nViceroy.\"[643] The second, and more important, despatch bore the date\r\nof October 8, and dealt with the _firman_ of the Sultan deposing\r\nMehemet Ali from the government of Egypt. France, declared M. Thiers,\r\nwas prepared to leave the question of Syria to the chances of the\r\nwar, which had actually begun. But the edict expelling the Pasha from\r\nEgypt was a different matter. It threatened to disturb the balance of\r\npower in the East, and France could, therefore, not consent to see it\r\ncarried into execution.[644] Certain writers have pompously asserted\r\nthat, on this occasion, M. Thiers \"formulated the _casus belli_.\" It\r\nmust be borne in mind, however, that he had already been informed by\r\nLord Granville of the light in which the British government regarded\r\nthe Porte's decree of deposition. Hence many of his contemporaries\r\ntreat his despatch of October 8 with derision. That famous document,\r\nthey contend, merely \"forced an open door.\"[645]\r\n\r\nThe extreme moderation with which M. Thiers had expressed himself came\r\nas a great surprise to the British government. M. Guizot, sincerely\r\nas he desired to see peace maintained, was strongly of opinion that\r\nso mild an exposition of the French case was strangely inconsistent\r\nwith the warlike attitude which his government had adopted, since\r\nthe beginning of the crisis. He contented himself, in consequence,\r\nwith placing M. Thiers' despatches in Lord Palmerston's hands, and\r\nmade no attempt to discuss or to defend the opinions expressed in\r\nthem.[646] Their contents, when communicated to the assembled British\r\nministers, removed at once the danger that acute differences of\r\nopinion might lead to a disruption of the government. At the Cabinet\r\nCouncil of October 10, it was simply decided that Lord Ponsonby\r\nshould be directed to urge the Porte to reinstate Mehemet Ali in\r\nthe governorship of Egypt and to make the appointment hereditary in\r\nhis family, provided he would consent to make an early submission\r\nto the Sultan. At the same time, it was agreed that a copy of these\r\ninstructions should be sent to Lord Granville for communication to the\r\nFrench government.[647]\r\n\r\nBut, in spite of the pacific language used by M. Thiers in his\r\ndespatches, the situation still gave cause for anxiety. The lower\r\nclasses in Paris had been greatly stirred by the Jacobinical\r\ndeclamations of the Radical press. On October 15, as Louis Philippe\r\nwas entering the Tuileries, he narrowly escaped the bullet of an\r\nassassin. The would-be regicide, an individual named Darmès,\r\nwhen arrested and questioned, declared that he was by profession\r\n\"a conspirator and an exterminator of tyrants.\" This outrage\r\nand other anarchical symptoms were not without effect upon the\r\n_bourgeoisie_.[648] The signs of the times pointed clearly to the\r\nprobability that war abroad would be followed by a revolution at home.\r\nMeanwhile, rumours were current that the government was preparing\r\nsome sudden act of aggression--an \"_Anconade_\"[649] as it was called.\r\nIt was said that the military occupation of some position in Turkey\r\nwas contemplated. The sudden recall, however, to Toulon of the French\r\nfleet, which had been cruising in Greek waters, seemed to prove, not\r\nonly that the government could have no such intention, but that it\r\nwas desirous of avoiding the danger of any chance collision with the\r\nBritish squadron operating off the Syrian coast. Nevertheless, after\r\nthe return home of Admiral Hugon's fleet, reports about the warlike\r\nplans of M. Thiers assumed a more concrete form. Lord Granville,\r\non October 12, received information from a person, who stipulated\r\nfor a special remuneration should his intelligence prove accurate,\r\nthat the French government had decided to seize one of the Balearic\r\nIslands.[650]\r\n\r\nThe strategic importance of these Spanish islands had been enhanced by\r\nthe French occupation of Algiers. Situated about midway between Toulon\r\nand the African coast, they would, in the hands of France, enable her\r\nto control the western Mediterranean. The British Foreign Office and\r\nthe Admiralty had, in consequence, been always on the alert, lest she\r\nshould by any means succeed in establishing herself at Port Mahon.\r\nIt had been ascertained that many of the inhabitants were not at all\r\naverse to the idea of a French annexation of Minorca.[651] But, in\r\naddition to the military advantages to be derived from the occupation\r\nof the Balearic Islands, there were political reasons which made both\r\nPalmerston and Bulwer suspect that M. Thiers might regard a _coup\r\nd'éclat_ in Spain as a useful counterstroke to the Treaty of July\r\n15.[652] The struggle between Christina[653] and the _Progressistas_\r\nhad been raging for some weeks past, and now appeared certain to\r\nterminate in the complete defeat of the Queen Regent. Upon the subject\r\nof Spanish affairs the British government held views which were\r\ndiametrically opposed to those entertained at the absolute Courts.\r\nAny stroke directed against Espartero and the Radicals could not\r\nfail to be applauded at Vienna, Berlin, and St. Petersburg. A French\r\nintervention in Spain might, therefore, be the means of sowing discord\r\nbetween Great Britain and her continental allies.\r\n\r\nLord Granville at once sent off a special messenger to Madrid to warn\r\nthe British minister of the blow which was impending, and Palmerston\r\nalso wrote to Mr. Aston to the same effect. Espartero,[654] when the\r\nnews was communicated to him, undertook to strengthen the garrison of\r\nPort Mahon, and promised to resist manfully any French aggression.\r\nMelbourne, at the same time, took the opportunity of remonstrating\r\nstrongly with Louis Philippe through the King of the Belgians.[655]\r\nEngland, he wrote, could not sit still whilst France continued to arm\r\nand to threaten. She must, if the present situation were prolonged,\r\ntake measures to safeguard her interests. This communication probably\r\nreached Louis Philippe on October 19. So long as he had believed\r\nthat Mehemet Ali was capable of offering a serious resistance to\r\nthe allied Powers, he had approved of the menacing attitude of his\r\ngovernment. But, when the Pasha's impotence was made manifest, he\r\nrealized the expediency of adopting different tactics. He understood\r\nthe difficulties of M. Thiers' position. Already the more extreme of\r\nthe various groups composing his parliamentary majority were beginning\r\nto testify their displeasure at the pacific tone of his despatch of\r\nOctober 8, which had been published in the English papers. At the\r\napproaching meeting of the Chambers heated and violent recriminations\r\nwere to be apprehended. Louis Philippe, however, had also perceived\r\nthat, notwithstanding the clamour of the newspapers, a healthy current\r\nof public opinion was running in the direction of peace. People\r\nwere beginning to realize that, under existing conditions, war and\r\nrevolution were synonymous terms. Some of M. Thiers' colleagues had,\r\nmoreover, it is said, privately intimated that, if peace were to be\r\nmaintained, the King must take upon himself to dismiss his present\r\nministers.[656] But the adoption of this disinterested advice was\r\nfraught with certain unpleasant consequences. For the past fortnight\r\nthe _Constitutionel_, M. Thiers' chief organ, had been insinuating\r\nthat all his efforts to uphold the honour and dignity of France\r\nwere frustrated by the Sovereign. The King was, therefore, under no\r\nillusions as to the manner in which his minister purposed to cover his\r\nretreat.\r\n\r\nThe Chambers were to assemble on October 28. M. Thiers, about a\r\nweek before, submitted to Louis Philippe a draft of the proposed\r\nSpeech from the Throne. It contained a distinctly warlike paragraph,\r\nand announced that 150,000 more men would be called up for service\r\nwith the colours. The King objected, and whilst the matter was under\r\ndiscussion, he received Lord Melbourne's letter. It is very possible\r\nthat a perusal of its contents may have served to overcome his last\r\nhesitations. He refused to employ the language which his minister\r\nproposed to place in his mouth. M. Thiers, thereupon, tendered his\r\nresignation, which was promptly accepted. Marshal Soult agreed to form\r\na new government, of which the real head was to be M. Guizot, the\r\nFrench ambassador in London, into whose charge the King had confided\r\nthe portfolio of Foreign Affairs.\r\n\r\nM. Thiers was not wholly responsible for the position in which France\r\nfound herself at the time of his downfall. When he took office, the\r\nmistakes of his predecessor had already carried the country a great\r\ndistance upon the road to isolation. Nevertheless, the brief period\r\nof his second administration affords an instructive example of the\r\nmany mistakes which a very able man may commit. The two principal\r\nobjects which he set himself to achieve were utterly incompatible. He\r\nsincerely desired to retain the friendship of Great Britain and, at\r\nthe same time, he proposed to establish Mehemet Ali as the ruler of an\r\nindependent State, which was to owe its separate existence to French\r\npatronage. But, inasmuch as Lord Palmerston was resolved to drive the\r\nPasha out of Syria and greatly to restrict his power, he was obliged\r\nto seek to attain his ends by tortuous methods. Thus, whilst he strove\r\nto prolong and to embarrass the negotiations in London, he endeavoured\r\nsecretly, and in flagrant violation of the _collective note of July\r\n27, 1839_, to cajole the Porte into conceding the demands of the\r\nPasha. He was able to persuade himself that the young Sultan and his\r\nministers, rather than follow the congenial advice of the Powers\r\nwhich desired to curb the ambition of Mehemet Ali, would listen to\r\nthe unpalatable counsels of France, the friend of their arch-enemy\r\nthe Viceroy of Egypt. A policy founded upon so erroneous a conception\r\nof human nature was fore-doomed to failure. The intrigues of the\r\nFrench agents at Alexandria and Constantinople[657] were exposed, the\r\ncorrespondence of M. Coste found its way into Lord Palmerston's drawer\r\nat the Foreign Office, and the treaty between the four Powers and the\r\nPorte was concluded on July 15.\r\n\r\nBut M. Thiers was guilty of another error. He, the student of war,\r\nthe _Napoleon civil_, as Metternich named him, altogether failed\r\nto understand the strategic situation in the East. Unlike Lord\r\nPalmerston, who foresaw that the Pasha's position in Syria would be\r\nuntenable, from the moment that he was deprived of the command of\r\nthe sea, Thiers conceived it possible that Ibrahim could assume the\r\noffensive in Asia Minor, and at the same time maintain, in the midst\r\nof a hostile population and through a most difficult country, his\r\ncommunications with Egypt. His plans were, accordingly, based upon\r\nthe supposition that the Powers would experience serious difficulty\r\nin expelling the Egyptians from Syria. The Pasha's resistance, he\r\nwas confident, would not be overcome before the winter, and would,\r\ndoubtless, necessitate the intervention of a Russian army. But, were\r\nthe Tsar to despatch a large force to Asia Minor, national jealousies\r\nand suspicion would be aroused. Then France, having completed her\r\nmilitary preparations, could enter upon the scene and impose her\r\nwill upon a disunited and disheartened coalition. In pursuance of\r\nthis plan, M. Thiers made divers attempts to draw the chief Italian\r\nStates into an alliance with France. But his proposals were unheeded\r\nboth at Turin and at Naples.[658] In one direction only would his\r\novertures appear to have met with any response. King Otho, the young\r\nBavarian prince whom the protecting Powers had placed upon the throne\r\nof Greece, attracted by the prospect of obtaining Crete, seems to have\r\npromised to invade Thessaly, whenever France should give the signal\r\nfor a general outbreak of hostilities.[659]\r\n\r\nBut all these schemes were rendered abortive by the state of impotence\r\nto which Ibrahim was reduced by the arrival of the British fleet in\r\nSyrian waters. After the success of Stopford's operations at Beyrout,\r\nM. Thiers was forced either to resign or to plunge France, with King\r\nOtho for her only ally, into a war with the whole of Europe. It is\r\nimpossible to believe that he can ever have thought seriously of\r\nadopting this last alternative. But Louis Philippe's unalterable\r\nresolution to maintain the peace made it safe for him to advocate a\r\nbellicose policy, seeing that he would never be called upon to carry\r\nit out. By proposing certain warlike measures, such as the seizure of\r\nthe Balearic Islands and a large increase of the army, he intended to\r\ncompel the King to dismiss him. Thus he would be enabled to escape\r\nfrom the difficulties in which he was involved, whilst upon Louis\r\nPhilippe would rest the reproach of having tamely submitted to the\r\ndictation of Lord Palmerston.\r\n\r\nThe injury done to the House of Orleans was not, however, the\r\nonly consequence of M. Thiers' proceedings in 1840. His warlike\r\ndeclamations and the frequent allusions in his newspapers to the left\r\nbank of the Rhine awoke recollections in Germany which had slumbered\r\nfor a generation. The amazing popularity of Becker's _Song of the\r\nRhine_[660] testifies to the strength of the national sentiment which\r\nthe French threats had aroused. The significance of this, and other\r\nmanifestations of German feeling, did not escape Prince Metternich.\r\n\"M. Thiers,\" he wrote bitterly, \"likes to be compared to Napoleon.\r\nWith respect to Germany he resembles him closely, indeed, he may\r\njustly be said to surpass him. In six weeks he has accomplished as\r\nmuch in that country as the Emperor during ten years of war and\r\noppression.\"[661]\r\n\r\nThe Soult-Guizot Cabinet had been formed upon the basis of the\r\nmaintenance of peace. But innumerable difficulties confronted it.\r\nWhilst pursuing a strictly pacific policy, ministers could not afford\r\nto disregard the national susceptibilities which the events of the\r\npast few months had aroused. Guizot, accordingly, before leaving\r\nLondon, and after his return to France, declared constantly that the\r\nfate of the new ministry was in the hands of the British government.\r\nIf only he could be enabled to state that the Powers were prepared to\r\nmake concessions to M. Thiers' successors, which they would not have\r\nmade to M. Thiers himself, he was confident that he could defeat his\r\nopponents. But, if it were resolved rigorously to execute the treaty\r\nagainst Mehemet Ali, he and his colleagues would surely be overwhelmed\r\nand the King would be forced to call the war party into his counsels.\r\nWithout doubt, his friends Reeve and Greville proved most useful in\r\npropagating this opinion.[662] Palmerston, however, was quite unmoved.\r\nHe scouted the notion that France would resort to extreme measures\r\nin defence of the Pasha, and he was determined that the British\r\ninterests, involved in the expulsion of Mehemet Ali from Syria, should\r\nnot be sacrificed in order to strengthen the parliamentary position of\r\na foreign government.\r\n\r\nAt the time of M. Thiers' resignation, his despatch of October 8 was\r\nstill unanswered. But, before M. Guizot had been long installed at\r\nthe Foreign Office, he received Lord Palmerston's reply to it. The\r\ncontents of this document caused him the greatest irritation. After\r\nexposing with remorseless logic the fallacies of M. Thiers' arguments,\r\nPalmerston laid down the principle that the future government of\r\nEgypt concerned the Porte alone. He has generally been blamed for\r\nnot employing a more conciliatory tone in this, his first important\r\ncommunication with M. Guizot, who was not responsible for the opinions\r\nof his predecessor in office. Palmerston, however, had two distinct\r\nobjects in view, and it is open to question whether he would have\r\nattained his ends, had he employed less uncompromising language. His\r\ndespatches, both of November 2 and November 20, were clearly written\r\nwith the purpose of convincing M. Guizot of the necessity of regarding\r\nSyria as altogether lost to Mehemet Ali, and of thus putting an end\r\nto the efforts which were being made to preserve for him the southern\r\nportion of Palestine. Secondly, by intimating that the Pasha's\r\nreinstatement in the government of Egypt would depend upon his prompt\r\ncompliance with the Sultan's demands, Palmerston evidently intended to\r\nforce M. Guizot to exert all his influence over Mehemet Ali in favour\r\nof a complete surrender.[663]\r\n\r\nEvents, meanwhile, had been moving rapidly in Syria. Before the\r\nmiddle of October the Turkish flag waved once more over Beyrout and\r\nSaïda, the ancient Sidon, whilst Napier, at the head of a Turkish\r\ndivision and some detachments of British and Austrian marines,\r\ncompletely defeated and put to flight the redoubtable Ibrahim. As\r\nearly as October 5, Palmerston had desired the Lords of the Admiralty\r\nto advise Sir Robert Stopford of the importance of promptly restoring\r\nthe fortress of Acre to the Sultan.[664] The allied commanders appear\r\nto have been somewhat undecided as to the propriety of attacking this\r\nfamous stronghold, the key of Syria. In view of the lateness of the\r\nseason, Stopford himself was very reluctant to embark upon operations\r\nagainst it.[665] But Palmerston's despatch overcame his irresolution\r\nand induced him to listen to the bolder counsels of Napier, Walker,\r\nand Jochmus. Acre, which had successfully resisted Bonaparte and which\r\nhad held Ibrahim in check for six months, surrendered, on November 3,\r\nto the British admiral after an engagement of a few hours' duration.\r\nThe moment the news reached London, Stopford was directed to send \"a\r\ncompetent officer\" to Mehemet Ali to signify to him that, provided he\r\nwould restore the Turkish fleet and give an undertaking in writing to\r\nevacuate Syria, Adana, Arabia, the Holy Cities and Crete, the Powers\r\nwould recommend the Porte to reappoint him to the governorship of\r\nEgypt.[666] But, before these instructions could take effect, Napier,\r\nwho had arrived off Alexandria with his squadron, had seen fit to\r\nconclude, upon his own responsibility, an agreement with Mehemet Ali.\r\nIn this unauthorized convention, which was signed on November 27, it\r\nwas stipulated that the Pasha should surrender the Turkish fleet and\r\nevacuate Syria, on the understanding that the four Powers in return\r\nwould guarantee to him the hereditary tenure of the Pashalic of\r\nEgypt.[667]\r\n\r\nNapier, who was a strong Radical, appears to have been privately urged\r\nby certain members of the Cabinet to seize the first opportunity of\r\nconcluding a peace with Mehemet Ali.[668] But, whatever his reasons\r\nmay have been for acting in so irregular a manner, the main provisions\r\nof his treaty, unquestionably, accorded with the instructions sent\r\nto Stopford on November 14. Palmerston, in consequence, decided\r\nto signify his approval of the arrangement, with one important\r\nreservation.[669] Under no circumstances \"could Great Britain\r\nsingly, or the four Powers jointly, guarantee to a subject a grant\r\nof administrative authority made to him by his Sovereign, within\r\nthe dominions of that Sovereign.\" But at Constantinople Napier's\r\nproceedings aroused the greatest indignation, and the Sublime Porte,\r\nwith the full concurrence of the ambassadors of the Powers, pronounced\r\nthe convention null and void.[670] The same course was adopted by\r\nStopford, who sent Captain Fanshawe, his flag captain, to Alexandria\r\nto declare that the convention of November 27 could not be ratified,\r\nand that Mehemet Ali must submit unconditionally to the terms which\r\nthe Powers were prepared to offer to him.[671]\r\n\r\nMehemet Ali could not do otherwise than yield. The fall of Acre had\r\ndecided the fate of Syria. Fanshawe's task was thus easy of execution,\r\nand, on December 16, he arrived at Constantinople bringing with him\r\na letter from Mehemet Ali to the Grand Vizier, in which the Pasha\r\nconceded every demand and, with regard to Egypt, threw himself upon\r\nthe generosity of the Sultan.[672] The Turkish ministers, however,\r\nwere little disposed to show mercy to a fallen enemy who, in the days\r\nof his strength, had caused them so much anxiety. Nor were the British\r\nambassador and the Austrian _internuncio_ in favour of treating\r\nMehemet Ali leniently. But Metternich had been terribly alarmed by the\r\nFrench armaments, and had sent strict instructions to his agent at\r\nConstantinople to terminate the eastern question with as little delay\r\nas possible. Baron Stürmer was, in consequence, reluctantly obliged\r\nto counsel the Porte to confer upon the Pasha the hereditary tenure\r\nof Egypt. Ponsonby, however, was more tenacious of his opinions, and,\r\nalthough Palmerston, after the Cabinet Council of October 10, had\r\ndirected him to advise the Turkish government to grant the heredity to\r\nMehemet Ali,[673] he declined to join with his colleagues in pressing\r\nthe Porte to adopt this measure. He was doubtful, he declared, whether\r\nthe Pasha's letter to the Grand Vizier should be regarded as an act of\r\ncomplete submission. Before pronouncing a decided opinion upon that\r\npoint, he must wait in order to see whether the Pasha by his actions\r\nintended to prove the sincerity of his promises.[674] But, on January\r\n10, 1841, he received Palmerston's despatch on the subject of Napier's\r\nconvention, wherein it was distinctly laid down that Great Britain\r\napproved of the principle of conferring the heredity upon Mehemet\r\nAli.[675] This second intimation of the views of his government was\r\ntoo clear for even Ponsonby to venture upon disregarding it. He was,\r\nin consequence, obliged to advise the Porte to make the required\r\nconcession. The Turkish ministers no sooner perceived that the\r\nPowers were unanimously in favour of it, than they promised to take\r\nthe necessary steps for investing Mehemet Ali with the hereditary\r\ngovernment of Egypt.[676]\r\n\r\nTwo days before this concession was extorted from the Porte, Mehemet\r\nAli surrendered the Ottoman fleet to the commissioners sent to receive\r\nit. Furthermore, he gave the necessary orders for the evacuation of\r\nCrete and the other territories which he had promised to restore to\r\nthe Sultan. His son Ibrahim, with the remnants of the army of Syria,\r\nhad by this time arrived at Gaza, on the Egyptian frontier. He had\r\nhimself been attacked by jaundice, and his troops had suffered cruelly\r\nin their retreat.[677] But their losses would have been far heavier,\r\nhad it not been for the Napier Convention. The British officers\r\nemployed in Syria had considered themselves in honour bound to observe\r\nthe armistice, which was one of the conditions of that irregular\r\nagreement.[678]\r\n\r\nMehemet Ali having thus made his submission, it remained only to\r\ndetermine the conditions under which the hereditary governorship of\r\nEgypt should be conferred upon him. The Porte was very naturally\r\ndesirous to circumscribe in every possible way, the powers which it\r\nhad reluctantly consented to delegate. Some weeks, accordingly, were\r\nspent in discussing the affair with the ambassadors. But, at last, on\r\nFebruary 13, 1841, the Porte issued a _firman_ of investiture, and\r\nsent off a special envoy to Egypt to present it to Mehemet Ali.[679]\r\n\r\nThe French government, meanwhile, rigidly abstained from any kind of\r\ninterference, M. Guizot from the tribune of the Chamber declared his\r\nintention of preserving the peace, whilst at the same time maintaining\r\nthe armaments which, by reason of her isolation, France could not\r\nafford to reduce. The Opposition inveighed fiercely against the\r\nattitude which the government proposed to adopt. M. Thiers gave his\r\nversion of the negotiations and protested that, had he been able to\r\nremain in office, he would have armed upon a gigantic scale, not only\r\nin order to prevent the execution of the Treaty of July, but in order\r\nto obtain a revision of the territorial settlement of 1815. To support\r\ntheir statements, he and his former colleagues recklessly divulged\r\nthe contents of confidential documents, and disclosed military\r\nsecrets.[680] Nevertheless, ministers obtained a majority in both\r\nChambers on the question of their foreign policy. The attention of the\r\nassembly, during the remainder of the session, was chiefly directed\r\nto matters connected with the fortification of Paris. The enormous\r\nexpenditure entailed by that measure, and by the other military\r\npreparations of M. Thiers had a very sobering effect upon the popular\r\nChamber. The crisis, it was computed, would cost the country not less\r\nthan one hundred and fifty millions of francs.[681]\r\n\r\nNo sooner had M. Guizot emerged successfully from the initial stages\r\nof the parliamentary struggle, than he applied himself diligently to\r\nthe task of bringing back France into the Concert of the Powers.\r\nThe German Courts, he was well aware, were most anxious to terminate\r\na situation pregnant with dangerous possibilities. In the eyes of\r\nMetternich and of Baron Werther, the Prussian minister, the isolation\r\nof France threatened the peace of Europe, and, in order to put an\r\nend to it, they were prepared to settle \"_tant bien que mal_,\"[682]\r\nthe eastern question. Under ordinary circumstances the Tsar Nicholas\r\nmight have been expected to oppose the resumption by France of her\r\nplace in the Concert of the Powers. But he had now strong reasons\r\nof his own for desiring that her isolation should cease. He had\r\ninstructed Brunnow to undertake that the Treaty of Unkiar-Skelessi\r\nshould not be renewed, because experience had proved that it was of no\r\npractical value.[683] The Cabinet of St. Petersburg had arrived at the\r\nconclusion that, for the better protection of the southern provinces\r\nof Russia, the question of the Dardanelles should be regulated by some\r\nEuropean agreement. But no compact of that nature would be likely to\r\nendure, unless France were to be made a party to it.[684]\r\n\r\nAlthough it suited Nicholas that France should re-enter the European\r\nConcert, his dislike of Louis Philippe, and of the _régime_ of July\r\nwas as strong as ever. Whilst proposing to close the eastern question\r\nwith some \"final transaction to which France might be invited to\r\nadhere,\"[685] he also suggested that the treaty for the pacification\r\nof the Levant should be converted into a quadruple alliance,\r\n\"providing against the contingency of an attack by France upon the\r\nliberties of Europe.\" His main reason, he informed Lord Clanricarde,\r\nfor making this proposal, was to establish a close understanding with\r\nGreat Britain.[686] Metternich had not \"the spirit of a gentleman,\"\r\nand neither England nor Russia ought to place any confidence in\r\nhim.[687] The British government, however, was unable to entertain the\r\nsuggestion. \"All formal engagements of the Crown,\" Lord Clanricarde\r\nwas instructed to explain, \"must be submitted to Parliament, and\r\nParliament might not approve of an engagement which should bind\r\nEngland prospectively.\" Nor was there any way in which this difficulty\r\ncould be overcome. It would not be removed by the verbal agreement\r\ninto which the Imperial Cabinet had declared its readiness to enter,\r\nshould the constitutional obstacles to the conclusion of a more\r\nformal compact prove insuperable. \"A verbal engagement would bind the\r\nministers who made it, but might be disavowed by their successors,\r\nand thus the Russian government might be led to count upon a system\r\nof policy which might not eventually be pursued. . . . Under these\r\ncircumstances,\" concluded Lord Palmerston, \"it seems to Her Majesty's\r\ngovernment that the Cabinet of St. Petersburg should be satisfied to\r\ntrust to the general tendency of the policy of Great Britain, which\r\nleads her to watch over the maintenance of the balance of power.\"[688]\r\n\r\nWhether or not M. Guizot obtained any inkling of the Tsar's proposals,\r\nhe appears to have ascertained quickly that the three absolute\r\nCourts wished to close the eastern question in order that France\r\nshould resume her place in the Concert. But he was very far from\r\ncertain whether Lord Palmerston's views coincided with those of\r\nhis continental allies. He was not without fear that it might be\r\nthe secret intention of Great Britain to drive Mehemet Ali out of\r\nEgypt. From the moment he had taken office, he had declared that the\r\nfate of Syria must be left to the chances of war, but that no French\r\ngovernment could acquiesce in the expulsion of the Pasha from his\r\nEgyptian governorship. So long, however, as France maintained her\r\narmaments Metternich would be most unlikely to consent to any further\r\nmeasures of hostility against Mehemet Ali. Thus by playing upon the\r\nfears of the German Courts, he could bring considerable pressure to\r\nbear upon Palmerston. Nor was it only in this way that he proposed\r\nto counteract the schemes which he suspected the British minister of\r\nharbouring. Lord Holland was dead, and the French party was greatly\r\ndiscredited, but he could still depend upon the assistance of \"Bear\"\r\nEllice,[689] Greville and his other English friends, whenever an\r\nopportunity of thwarting Palmerston should arise. For the purpose of\r\norganizing as much opposition as possible to the Foreign Secretary, he\r\nhad, in the month of November, 1840, despatched Baron Mounier upon a\r\nspecial mission to London.[690] At the same time Baron Bourqueney, the\r\nFrench _chargé d'affaires_, was instructed confidentially to discuss\r\nthe situation with his colleagues, but, under no circumstances, was\r\nhe to make any direct proposals to Lord Palmerston. He was constantly\r\nto declare that the isolation of France must continue, so long as the\r\ntreaty of July should be in existence.\r\n\r\nM. Guizot had made no mistake in supposing that Palmerston would\r\nrather have seen Mehemet Ali deposed than invested with the\r\nhereditary tenure of Egypt. But, as he pointed out to the Ottoman\r\nambassador, it was his rule in all affairs \"to be content with what\r\nwas practical,\"[691] and Lord Beauvale's despatches from Vienna\r\nmade it clear that Metternich would never consent to take part in\r\nexpelling the Pasha from Egypt.[692] Palmerston, therefore, accepted\r\nthe situation and was prepared to be satisfied with an arrangement\r\nwhich restricted the authority of Mehemet Ali to his Egyptian\r\nPashalic. He was opposed to the plan, which had been proposed at\r\none time, of inviting France to participate in the final settling\r\nbetween the Sultan and the Pasha. As the avowed protector of Mehemet\r\nAli she could not, he contended, fail to bring a dangerous element\r\nof discord into the conference.[693] Nevertheless, at the beginning\r\nof January, 1841, Baron Bourqueney, after having been his guest for\r\na few days at Broadlands, felt convinced that \"he was really anxious\r\nto discover some way of bringing back France into the concert,\r\nalthough he was still undecided as to the manner in which it should\r\nbe effected.\"[694] The correctness of this surmise was before long\r\nconfirmed by the event. After the decision of the four Powers to press\r\nthe Porte to confer the heredity upon Mehemet Ali had been embodied\r\nin the _collective note_ of January 30, 1841, Palmerston himself took\r\nthe initiative and invited Baron Bourqueney to call upon him at the\r\nForeign Office, in order to discuss future arrangements.\r\n\r\nThe conferences which were thus begun on February 18 continued until\r\nMarch 5, and resulted in the framing of two diplomatic instruments.\r\nThe first, termed the protocol, was only to be signed by the\r\nrepresentatives of the Powers which were parties to the Treaty of\r\nJuly 15, 1840. The difficulties which had induced the Porte to invoke\r\nthe assistance of the four Courts being now at an end, the wish was\r\nrecorded \"of expressing in the most formal manner the respect due to\r\nthe ancient rule of the Ottoman Empire, in virtue of which it has,\r\nat all times, been prohibited for ships of war of foreign Powers to\r\nenter the straits of the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus.\" With this\r\nprinciple, which was of general and permanent application, France was\r\nto be formally invited to concur. The second document consisted of a\r\ntreaty, known as The Convention of the Straits, according to which the\r\nSultan undertook to close the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus to the\r\nwarships of all foreign nations, and the Sovereigns of Great Britain,\r\nFrance, Prussia, Austria and Russia pledged themselves to uphold this\r\nancient rule of the Ottoman Empire.[695]\r\n\r\nM. Guizot, after the plenipotentiaries had agreed to certain small\r\nverbal alterations, pronounced himself satisfied with both documents.\r\nNevertheless, the full powers to sign, which Baron Bourqueney was\r\nexpecting to receive, were not transmitted. For the present, he\r\nwas merely authorized to initial the convention.[696] The news had\r\nreached Paris that Mehemet Ali was greatly displeased with the\r\nconditions attached to his _firman_ of investiture, and that he had,\r\nin consequence, refused to accept it. The decree in question had never\r\nbeen submitted to the approval of the ambassadors at Constantinople,\r\nand it now appeared that the heredity, which it professed to confer,\r\nwas of an entirely fictitious nature. At the death of Mehemet Ali, it\r\nwas provided that his successor was to be chosen by the Sultan from\r\namong any of his descendants. Furthermore, the appointment of all\r\nofficers of the Egyptian army, above the rank of captain, was to be\r\nregulated by the Porte. Lastly, the Pasha complained that the amount\r\nof the tribute imposed upon him was far too heavy. Rather than submit\r\nto conditions so humiliating he would once more appeal to arms.[697]\r\n\r\nThree months elapsed before the points in dispute could be settled.\r\nMeanwhile, the French government resumed its attitude of complete\r\naloofness, and M. Guizot declared that no powers to sign could be\r\nsent to London, so long as the possibility existed that coercion\r\nmight once more be applied to the Pasha under the terms of the Treaty\r\nof July. To the great annoyance of the German Courts, Palmerston\r\nwas resolutely opposed to any declaration that the objects of that\r\ntreaty had been attained. A premature dissolution of the alliance,\r\nhe maintained, would only encourage Mehemet Ali to adopt a more\r\ndefiant attitude, and must increase the difficulties of adjusting his\r\nrelations with the Sultan.[698] \"A question,\" he insisted, \"could not\r\nbe really finished merely by saying that it was so.\"[699] Metternich\r\nwas compelled reluctantly to admit the force of this argument.[700]\r\nBut, whilst he acknowledged the necessity of maintaining the alliance,\r\nhis agents insinuated freely that Palmerston desired to embarrass the\r\nnegotiations, in order to drive Mehemet Ali to commit some act of\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of Lord Ponsonby, it must be admitted, suggested that\r\nhis chief had no great wish to discover a peaceful solution of the\r\nEgyptian question. When the news arrived at Constantinople that\r\nMehemet Ali had refused to accept the _firman_, he at once advised\r\nthe Porte to hold no further communication with him. The Sublime\r\nPorte, he declared, need no longer fear the military power of\r\nMehemet Ali. \"His destruction might be the consequence[701] of his\r\nagain venturing to defy the Sultan.\" The patience with which Lord\r\nPalmerston submitted to Ponsonby's deviations from his instructions\r\nis undeniably suspicious. It is practically certain, however, that\r\nno secret understanding existed between them. Palmerston's personal\r\nviews with regard to Mehemet Ali accorded so completely with those\r\nof his agent, that he was induced to regard with a lenient eye his\r\nreluctance to carry out a distasteful task. But, whilst treating him\r\nwith great forbearance, he never allowed Lord Ponsonby to impose his\r\nopinions upon him. On January 26, 1841, in a despatch endorsed by\r\nQueen Victoria with the significant words \"highly approved,\"[702] he\r\ntold him plainly that his counsels to the Porte were not in harmony\r\nwith his instructions. Again, on March 16, he prescribed the necessity\r\nof overcoming the obstacles to a settlement so emphatically, that\r\nPonsonby wrote in reply, that he perceived that \"the end which he was\r\nexpected to attain was the arrangement of this affair with Mehemet Ali\r\nat any rate\" (_sic_).[703] Nor can it reasonably be contended that\r\nhis tone changed after the Pasha's refusal to accept the conditions\r\nof the _firman_ of investiture. On the contrary, in his instructions\r\nof April 10, he laid stress upon the necessity of adjusting the\r\npoints in dispute with as little delay as possible, and absolutely\r\ndissented from Ponsonby's view that the Sultan should hold no direct\r\ncommunication with Mehemet Ali.[704]\r\n\r\nPonsonby was, therefore, obliged to join with his colleagues in\r\nadvising the Porte to modify the _firman_ of February 13. Their\r\nrepresentations, combined with an intimation from Baron Stürmer that\r\nAustria[705] would withdraw from the alliance if her counsels were\r\ndisregarded, soon produced the desired effect. On April 14, Ponsonby\r\nwas able to report that the Divan had decided that the succession\r\nof Mehemet Ali should be regulated in accordance with the principle\r\nof primogeniture, that he should have the power of dealing with the\r\npromotion of all officers below the rank of brigadier-general, and\r\nthat the amount of his tribute should be reduced.[706] Nevertheless,\r\nsome weeks elapsed before the Porte could be induced to embody\r\nthese concessions in a new _firman_. For this delay Ponsonby was in\r\nno way responsible. On the contrary, he appears to have entered a\r\nvigorous protest against the procrastinating policy of the Turkish\r\nministers.[707] Greatly to Metternich's annoyance, however, Palmerston\r\npersisted in refusing to declare that the objects of the Treaty of\r\nJuly had been fully achieved. The French government, therefore,\r\ncontinued to withhold from Baron Bourqueney the authority to sign the\r\nConvention of the Straits. But M. Guizot was consumed with anxiety\r\nto conclude the affair, and in consequence of Palmerston's attitude\r\nhe was now compelled to instruct his agents in Egypt to urge Mehemet\r\nAli to accept the amended _firman_, which they were to declare was no\r\nlonger open to any reasonable objections.[708]\r\n\r\nMehemet Ali was too astute to offer any further resistance. On July\r\n8, 1841, Ponsonby's singularly laconic despatch reached London,\r\nannouncing \"the satisfactory intelligence\"[709] that the Pasha had\r\naccepted the new _firman_, and had made a complete submission to the\r\nSultan. The representatives of the Powers which were parties to the\r\nTreaty of July, thereupon, affixed their signatures to the protocol,\r\nwhich they had initialed four months before, announcing that the\r\nobjects of their alliance had been fully attained. Three days later\r\nthe isolation of France was formally terminated. On July 13, the\r\nplenipotentiaries of Great Britain, Austria, Russia, Prussia and\r\nFrance signed the Convention of the Straits by which their respective\r\nSovereigns pledged themselves to uphold the principle of the closure\r\nof the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus to the warships of the Powers.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of the Convention of the Straits was the last important\r\nact of the Melbourne government. After sustaining a defeat on the\r\nsugar question, on May 18, ministers, in the subsequent motion of want\r\nof confidence brought forward by Sir Robert Peel, found themselves\r\nin a minority of one. At the general elections which followed, the\r\nConservatives obtained a decisive victory. The Whigs, in consequence,\r\nretired from office, and Lord Palmerston was replaced at the Foreign\r\nOffice by Lord Aberdeen.\r\n\r\nPalmerston's conduct of the Turco-Egyptian affair has been the\r\nsubject of much adverse criticism. M. Thureau-Dangin and other French\r\nwriters have asserted that his eastern policy, in 1840, was based\r\nupon the desire deliberately to injure France. The Treaty of July,\r\nthey contend, was simply a retaliation upon Louis Philippe, because\r\nhe had declined to interfere more actively in the civil war in Spain.\r\nNor does Palmerston escape censure at the hands of the chief English\r\nhistorian of this period. Sir Spencer Walpole,[710] re-echoing the\r\nviews of Lord Holland and the French party, charges him with having\r\nsacrificed the greater to the lesser object. The good understanding\r\nwith France, which Palmerston compromised so recklessly, was a\r\nmatter, he argues, of far more importance to England than any question\r\nconnected with the rule of the Sultan or of the Pasha over Syria and\r\nArabia. Furthermore, he accuses him of inconsistency. His alliance\r\nwith the absolute Courts, in 1840, was a complete negation of the\r\npolicy which, in 1834, had led him to conclude the Quadruple Treaty\r\nwith Liberal France for the maintenance of constitutionalism in Spain\r\nand Portugal.\r\n\r\nTo these different charges there are certain obvious answers. It\r\nhas been shown that Palmerston, far from maliciously desiring to\r\nexclude France from the treaty for the pacification of the Levant,\r\nhonestly endeavoured to persuade her to combine with Great Britain,\r\nand the other Powers in the affair. It was only when he perceived\r\nthat M. Thiers was secretly working to establish conditions in the\r\nMediterranean, which could not fail to have a prejudicial effect\r\nupon his country's highest interests, that he decided to act without\r\nher. He by no means undervalued the importance of good relations\r\nwith France, but, in order to preserve them, he was not prepared to\r\nshut his eyes to proceedings which might some day imperil the safety\r\nof British India. The public statements of M. Thiers and of certain\r\nof his colleagues are alone sufficient to justify Lord Palmerston's\r\npolicy in 1840. Under the question as to whether Syria and Arabia\r\nshould be restored to the direct rule of the Sultan, which Sir Spencer\r\nWalpole dismisses as a secondary consideration, lay the question as to\r\nwhether a great naval Power should gain a footing upon the shores of\r\nthe Persian Gulf.\r\n\r\nThe reasoning by which the same writer seeks to justify his accusation\r\nof inconsistency is still more unconvincing. The Treaty of July was\r\nconcluded for a definite purpose which involved no repudiation of\r\nthe principles underlying the Quadruple Treaty of 1834. Yet Sir\r\nSpencer Walpole, apparently, regards it as a betrayal of Liberalism\r\nthat England, in a question of eastern policy, should have separated\r\nherself from a constitutional Power and have allied herself with\r\nthe absolute Courts of Russia, Austria and Prussia. Under any\r\ncircumstances such a contention would be difficult to uphold, but\r\nwhen applied to France, in 1840, it becomes altogether inadmissible.\r\nNeither Louis Philippe nor his principal ministers were Liberals in\r\nthe proper sense of the word. Treaty engagements notwithstanding,\r\ntheir attitude towards the cause of liberty in Spain, although not so\r\nopenly proclaimed, was almost as unsympathetic as that of the Cabinets\r\nof the autocratic monarchies. Louis Philippe, Molé, Guizot and even\r\nThiers, when they did not actively oppose it, did nothing to assist\r\nthe development of popular government in Europe.\r\n\r\nBut whatever verdict may be passed upon Palmerston's Egyptian policy,\r\nhis rare skill and determination in carrying it out must command\r\nuniversal admiration. Although ruin, disgrace and perhaps impeachment\r\nmust have been the penalty of failure, he never wavered in his\r\nresolution to execute his treaty in all its details. His indomitable\r\nspirit stimulated the courage of his allies abroad and triumphed over\r\nthe opposition of his fellow-ministers at home. When he quitted the\r\nForeign Office British prestige stood at a height which it had not\r\nreached since the Battle of Waterloo. His most persistent detractors\r\nhad been forced to admit the correctness of his military judgment and\r\nhis prescience in treating as of no account the warlike threats of\r\nLouis Philippe and of M. Thiers.\r\n\r\n\"Palmerston,\" wrote Reeve regretfully, \"has bowled out every\r\none.\"[711] Charles Greville was moved to enthusiasm. \"The elder\r\nPitt,\" he records, \"could not have manifested more decision and\r\nresource. Success is much more attributable to Palmerston than to our\r\nnaval and military commanders, and, probably, solely to him.\"[712]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n                      THE CORDIAL UNDERSTANDING\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen, the Secretary for Foreign Affairs in Sir Robert Peel's\r\nCabinet, had held the same office in the government of the Duke of\r\nWellington. He had had to deal, as will be remembered, with the\r\nquestion of the recognition of Louis Philippe and with the attitude\r\nwhich England was to observe towards the revolution in Belgium. His\r\nfirst experience of diplomacy had been gained in the days of the great\r\nwar. In 1813, as quite a young man, he had been sent upon a special\r\nmission to Vienna, and had been concerned in the negotiations which\r\nhad resulted in the entry of Austria into the coalition. During the\r\ncampaign in Germany he had accompanied the headquarters of the allied\r\narmies and had been profoundly impressed by the scenes of which he had\r\nbeen a witness. Whether justified or not, the belief prevailed widely\r\nthat, should complications arise, the spectacle of Leipsic after\r\n\"the battle of the nations\" would be ever present before the eyes of\r\nEngland's Foreign Secretary.[713]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the more important questions which the Foreign Office\r\nhad in hand, or with which it had recently been called upon to deal,\r\nAberdeen was in substantial agreement with Palmerston. He approved\r\nof his policy in the Egyptian affair and endorsed his views as to\r\nthe necessity of encouraging Spain to shake off the influence of\r\nFrance. But he was at the same time intensely desirous of replacing\r\nFranco-British relations upon their former intimate footing, and of\r\nallaying the irritation which the Treaty of July had aroused. To\r\nattain this end he was prepared to make far greater concessions than\r\nany to which Palmerston would have consented. No one was so convinced\r\nas he of the truth of the saying, ascribed to the Duke of Wellington,\r\nthat the peace of Europe would remain unbroken, so long as France\r\nand England were united. It was not in their policies, but in their\r\npersonal characters, that lay the real difference between Aberdeen\r\nand Palmerston. Aberdeen was by nature conciliatory. Palmerston was\r\ninstinctively combative, and would rarely deny himself the pleasure\r\nof relentlessly exposing the fallacies of an opponent's arguments.\r\nAberdeen, although in some respects more of a Liberal than his\r\npredecessor, had a scholar's abhorrence, which had been intensified by\r\nhis former relations with Metternich and other continental statesmen,\r\nof all movements of a revolutionary character. Palmerston was a man of\r\ncoarser fibre, but of wider sympathies, than his grave and studious\r\nsuccessor.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the earnest desire of both Lord Aberdeen and of\r\nM. Guizot to bring matters to a successful conclusion, the first\r\nimportant transaction between the new British government and the\r\nFrench Foreign Office led to no satisfactory result. In 1831, and\r\nagain in 1833, France and England had contracted certain engagements\r\ntowards each other for the purpose of suppressing the slave trade.\r\nThey had agreed that their cruisers should stop and overhaul any\r\nsuspected vessel, whether flying the French or the British flag.\r\nPalmerston, however, had not been content with an arrangement, which\r\nlimited the right of search to ships purporting to be of French or\r\nEnglish nationality. He, accordingly, in combination with France, made\r\nrepresentations on the subject to the other Powers and succeeded in\r\ninducing them to agree to the principle which the French and English\r\ngovernments had adopted. The new convention, to which all the chief\r\nEuropean Powers were to be parties, was ready for signature at the\r\ntime when it became evident that a change of government in England was\r\nabout to take place. Palmerston, who had always been keenly interested\r\nin suppressing the slave trade, was particularly anxious that his\r\nname should be affixed to an international agreement which, he hoped,\r\nwould prove the means of abolishing a traffic which he abhorred.\r\nM. Guizot, however, saw fit purposely to delay matters in order to\r\ndeprive him of this satisfaction. Nor did he make any secret of his\r\nreasons for acting in this manner. Palmerston's attitude towards him,\r\nhe complained to Henry Bulwer, had been unfriendly. In his dispatch\r\nof November 2, 1840,[714] he had shown a total lack of consideration\r\nfor the difficulties of his position, and in a recent speech to his\r\nconstituents at Tiverton he had made some highly offensive remarks\r\nabout the manner in which the French military authorities in Algeria\r\nwere carrying on their war with the Arab tribes.[715]\r\n\r\nBut, once Lord Aberdeen was installed in Downing Street, M. Guizot's\r\nobjections to proceeding with the slave trade convention disappeared.\r\nThe necessary powers were sent to Sainte-Aulaire, the French\r\nambassador, and, on December 20, 1841, the treaty, regulating the\r\nright of search, was signed in London. It was soon clear, however,\r\nthat M. Guizot had been mistaken in supposing that the Chamber\r\nwould agree to ratify the agreement into which he had entered. The\r\nopposition to slavery had never been so pronounced in France as in\r\nEngland, and the Treaty of July had greatly stimulated the old feeling\r\nof jealousy of British maritime supremacy. By reason of England's\r\nnaval preponderance, the duty of stopping suspected vessels must\r\nnecessarily devolve chiefly upon her officers. Both in the French\r\nChambers and in the press it was hotly contended that the new treaty\r\nwas but a device, by means of which England purposed to arrogate to\r\nherself the right of policing the sea. So keen was this feeling that\r\nM. Guizot was forced to inform the British government that France\r\nwould be unable to ratify. Popular opposition, it was thought, would\r\ndiminish with time, and the protocol was accordingly kept open, in the\r\nhope that France might still become a party to the treaty. But this\r\nexpectation was not fulfilled, and on November 9, 1842, the definite\r\nwithdrawal of France was officially communicated to Lord Aberdeen.\r\nThe affair caused no little resentment and disappointment in England.\r\nThree years later, however, M. Guizot was enabled to re-open the\r\nquestion. By that time the relations of the two countries were upon\r\na more friendly footing, and the Duc de Broglie and Dr. Lushington,\r\nthe commissioners of their respective governments, succeeded, in\r\nconsequence, in arriving at an agreement. The new treaty, signed on\r\nMay 29, 1845, fulfilled all the essential conditions of previous\r\nconventions, but provided that, in future, the right of search\r\nin African waters should be exercised by a joint Franco-British\r\nsquadron.[716]\r\n\r\nSpanish affairs, however, were destined to be the question which was\r\nto occupy the chief attention of the two governments. It has been\r\nrelated how, in the autumn of 1840, Christina had been forced to\r\nquit Spain, and how, in the spring of the following year, the Cortes\r\nhad elected Espartero sole Regent of the kingdom. This solution\r\nof the difficulty was by no means acquiesced in as satisfactory\r\nby all parties. The elevation of the popular general to the head\r\nof the government was necessarily regarded as a victory for the\r\n_Progressistas_ and, consequently, as a triumph for English diplomacy.\r\nIndeed, since the abdication of the Queen-Mother, the _Moderados_, as\r\na parliamentary party, had almost ceased to exist. But their leaders\r\nstill continued to correspond with Christina, whose house in the Rue\r\nde Courcelles in Paris soon became the centre of a vast conspiracy\r\nagainst the new Regent.\r\n\r\nWhilst it was thus a matter of common notoriety that the _Moderado_\r\nchiefs, together with General Narvaez and other military rivals of\r\nEspartero, were plotting in Paris[717] to overthrow the new order of\r\naffairs in Spain, the question of the young Queen's marriage suddenly\r\nsprang into prominence. Isabella was not yet twelve years of age,\r\nbut already the selection of her husband was the subject of grave\r\ndeliberations in Paris and in London. Christina had always considered\r\nit to be vitally important that her daughter should marry a member of\r\none of the great reigning families. As far back as the year 1838, at\r\na most critical period of the civil war, when it was evident that no\r\nassistance was to be expected from Louis Philippe, she had suggested\r\nto the British minister that Isabella might be affianced to an English\r\nprince. If the difficulties arising from the difference of religion\r\nshould prove insurmountable, she would be satisfied with the betrothal\r\nof her daughter to a member of the House of Coburg, \"on account\r\nof the excellent education which the princes of that family had\r\nreceived, and on account of their near connection with Her Britannic\r\nMajesty.\"[718] Villiers was without instructions upon the point,\r\nbut he took upon himself to declare unhesitatingly that the English\r\nmatch could never be effected. Christina, thereupon, announced her\r\nintention of marrying her daughter to a son of the Archduke Charles of\r\nAustria. It was a combination which, \"she was now convinced, afforded\r\nthe best means of pacifying the country.\" The negotiations at Vienna,\r\nshe informed him, would be entrusted to M. de Cea Bermúdez and their\r\nsuccess would largely depend upon the amount of support given them by\r\nthe British government.[719]\r\n\r\nPalmerston, upon receiving Villiers' despatch, immediately conveyed\r\nto him \"Her Majesty's gracious approbation of the course which he had\r\npursued.\"[720] At the same time, he informed him that the British\r\ngovernment could not possibly take part in M. de Cea's negotiations\r\nat Vienna, \"without in the first instance communicating thereupon\r\nwith the government of France and, as the King of the French would\r\nbe extremely averse to such a marriage, it was not probable that\r\nsuch a communication would contribute much to the accomplishment of\r\nthe object.\" Nor was there any likelihood, he predicted, that the\r\nAustrian Cabinet would entertain the offer. This view of the case\r\nwas soon borne out by the event. Metternich at once disclaimed any\r\nintention of listening to Christina's proposals, whilst M. Molé, who,\r\nnotwithstanding the secrecy which had been observed, was aware of the\r\nreasons of M. de Cea's presence at Vienna, declared to Lord Granville\r\nthat \"the armed intervention of France would, undoubtedly, be the\r\nconsequence of any attempt to place an Austrian prince upon the throne\r\nof Spain.\"[721]\r\n\r\nThe triumph of the constitutionalists and the termination of the civil\r\nwar necessarily invested Isabella with an importance which she had\r\nnot possessed, whilst the issue of the struggle was uncertain. Once\r\nthe stability of her throne seemed assured, she appeared to Louis\r\nPhilippe in the light of a most eligible daughter-in-law. In the\r\nmonth of November, 1839, Christina's former minister, Count Toreno,\r\nwas understood to be engaged in negotiating a marriage between a son\r\nof the King of the French and the young Queen of Spain. The scheme,\r\nreported the British _chargé d'affaires_, had numerous supporters. But\r\nthe Queen Regent had informed him privately that \"she was hostile to\r\nthe match and had other views for her daughter.\"[722] It is probable\r\nthat Christina was perfectly sincere in thus declaring her intentions\r\nto Mr. Southern. Nor is there any reason to suppose that, after\r\nher abdication, her objections to the French marriage diminished.\r\nBut, inasmuch as she was residing in Paris and hoped to obtain the\r\nassistance of Louis Philippe to her schemes for overturning Espartero,\r\nshe was necessarily compelled to conceal her real sentiments. The\r\nre-establishment of French ascendancy at the Court of Madrid occupied\r\na foremost place in the policy both of the King and of M. Guizot. So\r\nlong, however, as Espartero and the _Progressistas_ were in power\r\nthere was little prospect that they would be enabled to bring their\r\nplans to a successful conclusion. Under the circumstances, therefore,\r\nthey were disposed to regard with a friendly eye the proceedings of\r\nthe military and _Moderado_ malcontents in Paris. Bulwer strongly\r\nsuspected that some kind of a compact existed, whereby Louis Philippe\r\npromised indirectly to assist the conspirators, and Christina, in\r\nreturn, undertook to employ her parental influence over Isabella\r\nin favour of her marriage with the Prince de Joinville or the Duc\r\nd'Aumale.[723]\r\n\r\nThe insurrection against Espartero broke out early in October, 1841.\r\nThe standard of rebellion was raised by O'Donnell at Pampeluna and by\r\nthe generals commanding the garrisons of Vittoria and Saragossa. But\r\ntheir plans, which had been so carefully matured in Paris, miscarried,\r\nand the loyal troops experienced little difficulty in dispersing their\r\nfollowers and in restoring tranquillity. Madrid, in the meanwhile,\r\nhad been the scene of one of the most dramatic episodes in recent\r\nhistory. On the night of October 7, Generals Concha and Diego Leon,\r\nat the head of a band of military conspirators, penetrated into the\r\npalace with the object of carrying off the young Queen. But when they\r\nattempted to ascend the grand staircase they encountered a determined\r\nparty of halberdiers. A furious struggle then ensued. The crash of\r\nmusketry reverberated through the palace, and bullets struck the\r\nwalls of the room in which the terrified Isabella had sought refuge\r\nwith her attendants. But help was soon forthcoming. The resistance of\r\nthe halberdiers had enabled the national militia, which was animated\r\nby strong Liberal and _Progressista_ sentiments, to assemble. At\r\nthe appearance of the citizen soldiers the conspirators either fled\r\nor laid down their arms. Some of their leaders escaped to France,\r\nbut Leon was captured and, a few days later, paid the penalty of\r\nhis treason, his youth, his good looks and his former distinguished\r\nservices earning for him a sympathy which the circumstances of his\r\ncase in no way justified.\r\n\r\n\"With respect to the share of the French government in organizing\r\nand promoting this enterprise,\" wrote Lord Aberdeen, \"I do not think\r\nit necessary to enter into an enquiry at present. We have received\r\nthe most positive assurances that they have been entirely strangers\r\nto the undertaking. Whatever may be the value of these assurances,\r\nthe attempt having happily failed, there appears to be no advantage\r\nin testifying suspicion and distrust.\"[724] He, accordingly,\r\ndirected Bulwer to do all in his power to persuade Olozaga, the\r\nSpanish minister, to adopt as moderate a tone as possible in his\r\ncommunications with M. Guizot. The Spanish government was naturally\r\ndeeply incensed at the encouragement which the conspirators had\r\nreceived in Paris, and their representations on the subject included\r\na demand for the expulsion of Christina from France. This was\r\nperemptorily refused and the relations of the two countries began to\r\nassume a very disquieting appearance. In Bulwer's opinion, were Louis\r\nPhilippe to receive any encouragement from Austria or Prussia, he\r\nmight not improbably embark upon a war with Spain. \"Should hostilities\r\nbreak out,\" he warned Lord Aberdeen, \"Barcelona would be the French\r\nobjective, on account of the effect which its capture would have on\r\nthose Courts which are fearful of the democratic opinions prevailing\r\nthere.\"[725]\r\n\r\nAberdeen's instructions to Mr. Aston, the British minister at Madrid,\r\nwere of the same nature as those transmitted to Bulwer in Paris. He\r\nwas to warn the Spanish ministers of the folly of provoking a rupture\r\nwith France. But, at the same time, he was to assure Espartero that\r\n\"the policy of Great Britain would continue to be directed towards the\r\nmaintenance of the real independence of Spain and to her protection\r\nfrom whatever quarter she might be threatened.\"[726] Meanwhile, the\r\nBritish government would make every effort to induce the Northern\r\nCourts formally to acknowledge the sovereignty of Isabella.[727]\r\nWhether designedly or not, however, the endeavours of Lord Aberdeen\r\nin this direction were frustrated by France. Owing in a great measure\r\nto his good offices, the Spanish government withdrew its demand for\r\nChristina's expulsion.[728] Louis Philippe, thereupon, directed M.\r\nde Salvandy, who some weeks earlier had been appointed ambassador at\r\nMadrid, to proceed to his post. But this measure, which seemed to\r\nforeshadow the establishment of more harmonious relations between\r\nthe two countries, led to a most unfortunate complication. Salvandy,\r\nupon his arrival at Madrid, insisted upon being allowed to place\r\nhis credentials in the hands of Isabella herself and absolutely\r\ndeclined to present them to Espartero, the Regent. Both sides invoked\r\nprecedents in support of their attitude and pressed their arguments\r\nwith the greatest warmth. Finally, Salvandy withdrew from Madrid\r\ntaking with him all the members of his embassy, with the exception of\r\nhis second secretary, the Duc de Glücksberg, a son of Louis XVIII.'s\r\nfavourite minister, the Duc Décazes.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to discuss the various questions of diplomatic\r\netiquette raised in this controversy. Whilst, upon the whole,\r\ninclining to the French point of view, Lord Aberdeen was of opinion\r\nthat the dispute could have been amicably adjusted without great\r\ndifficulty. The attitude of Mr. Aston, he considered, had not been\r\naltogether satisfactory, and he was disposed to impute blame to him\r\nfor not having discovered some basis for a compromise. Not content\r\nwith censuring him, he allowed M. Guizot to be furnished with a copy\r\nof the letter in which his disapproval was expressed.[729] When\r\nSalvandy was appointed to the Court of Madrid Bulwer had described\r\nhim as \"a man of letters, but pompous and ridiculous in manner and\r\nunlikely to acquire an influence over the young Queen of Spain.\"[730]\r\nBut, if it was the secret desire of Louis Philippe to provoke a\r\nquarrel with Espartero, he was perhaps the most suitable person he\r\ncould have selected for the purpose. The dispute involving, as it\r\nwas supposed to have done, the monarchical principle had effectually\r\ndispelled all hope that the absolute Powers would agree to renew\r\ndiplomatic relations with the Court of Madrid--a circumstance which\r\nLouis Philippe, in conversation with the British ambassador, affected\r\n\"to deplore most deeply.\"[731] So far as France was concerned,\r\nhowever, the Duc de Glücksberg was left at Madrid without official\r\ntitle, in order merely to carry on the ordinary business between the\r\ntwo countries.\r\n\r\nBut in all matters relating to Spanish affairs the question of\r\nIsabella's marriage occupied the foremost place. Louis Philippe now\r\nprotested that he had never for a moment entertained the idea of\r\nputting forward one of his sons as a candidate for her hand. But,\r\nafter making this assertion, he invariably added that he should object\r\nto her marrying any prince who did not belong to either the Spanish\r\nor Neapolitan branch of the House of Bourbon.[732] Accordingly, in\r\nFebruary, 1842, he sent M. Pageot, who had been for several years\r\nfirst secretary of the French embassy at Madrid, to London, for the\r\npurpose of obtaining the accession of the British government to the\r\nprinciple that the husband of the Queen of Spain must be a descendant\r\nof Philip V. After leaving London Pageot was to proceed to Vienna,\r\nwhere he was to hold the same language to Prince Metternich.\r\n\r\nNeither in London nor at Vienna, however, was M. Pageot able to\r\nbring his mission to a successful conclusion. Lord Aberdeen declared\r\nemphatically that England could not recognize the right of France\r\nto dispose of the hand of Isabella. The British government looked\r\nupon the matter \"as an exclusively Spanish affair, which ought to be\r\nregulated solely by considerations affecting the happiness of the\r\nQueen and the welfare of her people.\" At these words M. Pageot, at\r\nonce, interposed with the remark that he presumed that he was now at\r\nliberty to inform his government that England would not object to her\r\nmarriage with a French prince. But Aberdeen, with equal promptitude,\r\nadded an important amendment to his first statement. The marriage of\r\nthe Queen of Spain with a son of Louis Philippe would, he asserted,\r\nupset the balance of power, and England would always oppose any\r\ncombination calculated to produce political consequences of that\r\nnature.[733] Metternich was no less emphatic in protesting against the\r\npretensions of the King of the French to dictate on such a subject to\r\nan independent State. Nor was he less decided in declaring that the\r\ngeneral interests of Europe would be endangered by Isabella's marriage\r\nwith a son of Louis Philippe. In his opinion the whole Spanish\r\nquestion might be amicably settled by the betrothal of the Queen\r\nto a son of Don Carlos, without any sacrifice of their respective\r\nrights, as in the case of Ferdinand and Isabella in the fifteenth\r\ncentury. This was a view of the case, however, with which the\r\nBritish government was unable to concur. \"Prince Metternich,\" wrote\r\nAberdeen,[734] \"has been misled by a fancied historical analogy. The\r\nsolution, he suggests, might have been productive of good whilst the\r\ncivil war was in progress and whilst Don Carlos was in possession of\r\nthe northern provinces. But, now that he and his adherents have been\r\ndriven from Spain as fugitives, it would be regarded with the utmost\r\nrepugnance by the majority of Spaniards. A marriage of the Queen with\r\na son of Don Carlos, although it might reconcile the personal claims\r\nof each, would inevitably bring into fierce and hostile contact the\r\npassions and opinions of their adherents.\"\r\n\r\nPageot's mission, therefore, had done little to advance the question\r\nof Isabella's marriage. Meanwhile, Count Toreno, Christina's\r\nconfidential adviser in Paris, had, on several occasions, sought\r\nout Lord Cowley, the British ambassador, for the express purpose of\r\ninforming him that the Queen-Mother would prefer to see her daughter\r\nmarried to a Coburg rather than to a Bourbon prince.[735] At the same\r\ntime Espartero was known to be engaged in attempting to negotiate her\r\nmarriage with the third son of the King of Bavaria. Louis Philippe,\r\nfor his part, was more than ever determined to restrict her choice\r\nof a husband to the Bourbon candidates, and, in Lord Cowley's\r\nopinion, had serious thoughts \"of supporting his pretensions by an\r\narmament.\"[736] It was, however, by more indirect methods that he\r\nproposed to attain his ends. All through the spring and summer of\r\n1842 the Spanish malcontents, both in Paris and upon the frontiers,\r\ndisplayed renewed activity. The Carlists and the _Christinos_,\r\nhaving concluded an alliance based upon the marriage of Isabella\r\nwith a son of the Pretender, openly prepared for united action\r\nagainst their common enemy, the Regent Espartero.[737] This compact\r\nwas, doubtless, the reason of the seeming approval, given by Louis\r\nPhilippe, to Metternich's utterly impracticable plan for settling the\r\nSpanish difficulty.[738] Neither the representations of the Spanish\r\ngovernment nor a strong protest from Lord Aberdeen[739] had any\r\neffect in inducing the French authorities to place any check upon the\r\nproceedings of the conspirators.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1842, a formidable insurrection broke out at Barcelona.\r\nThe rising assumed from the outset a republican character, and, in\r\ntheir first conflicts with the troops, the insurgents were uniformly\r\nsuccessful. The arrival of reinforcements, however, soon altered the\r\naspect of affairs and enabled General Van Halen to re-establish the\r\nauthority of the Regent. Once more Louis Philippe and Christina were\r\nloudly accused of having promoted the outbreak. The Queen-Mother,\r\nreported Lord Cowley, undoubtedly supplied the revolutionists with\r\nmoney, and General Atthalin, a close personal friend of the King and\r\nan officer of his household, had been in secret communication with\r\nthe organizers of the movement. \"The Spanish government,\" wrote Mr.\r\nAston, \"considers that the insurrection at Barcelona has been promoted\r\nby France with the twofold object of preventing the conclusion of\r\na commercial treaty with Great Britain and of causing the downfall\r\nof the Regent.[740] The complaints, which the Spanish _chargé\r\nd'affaires_ was instructed to make in Paris, bore especially upon the\r\nproceedings of M. Ferdinand de Lesseps,[741] the French consul at\r\nBarcelona, who was accused of having actively assisted the insurgents.\r\nM. Guizot, however, who, according to Lord Cowley, had taken no part\r\nin these intrigues, defended the conduct of Lesseps and directed the\r\nDuc de Glücksberg to obtain a retractation of the charges brought\r\nagainst him from the Cabinet of Madrid.[742] The situation thus\r\nassumed a very dangerous appearance, and Lord Aberdeen intervened\r\nonce more in the interests of peace. Let the Spanish government, he\r\nurged, institute a calm and dispassionate inquiry into all the facts\r\nalleged against the French consul and let no reparation be demanded\r\nof the French government, unless there be evidence of his culpability\r\nsufficient to satisfy all impartial persons.[743] This advice was\r\naccepted, and, after a thorough examination of all the circumstances\r\nof the case, a disavowal of certain of the more serious charges was\r\ninserted in the _Gazette_ at Madrid. Nevertheless, as Lord Aberdeen\r\npointed out, \"few people could read with impartial attention the\r\nvarious documents without coming to the conclusion that M. de Lesseps\r\ndid very considerably exceed the limits of his consular duties,\" and\r\nhe, therefore, ventured to express the hope that the French government\r\n\"would no longer retain him in the place where his undue activity had\r\nbeen displayed.[744]\r\n\r\nUnder ordinary circumstances, Louis Philippe would not have hesitated\r\nto dispense with the services of a consul, who had shown sympathy\r\nwith a republican insurrection. But it being his secret policy to\r\ncreate every kind of embarrassment for Espartero he declined to\r\nrecall M. de Lesseps.[745] The refusal of the French government\r\naroused great indignation in Spain and materially contributed to\r\nincrease the difficulties which were threatening to overwhelm the\r\nRegent.[746] The popular general, the idol of the nation, was now an\r\nobject of execration with all parties. His stern repression of anarchy\r\nhad gained for him the hatred of the extreme democrats, whilst his\r\nignorance of the principles of representative government had involved\r\nhim in innumerable disputes with the Cortes. The only remedy which he\r\ncould apply to the situation was to prorogue the Chambers and assume\r\nthe powers of a military dictator. But the army was no longer his\r\nwilling instrument. The senior officers, with few exceptions, held\r\n_Moderado_ opinions, and, for the past two years, General Narvaez and\r\nother agents of Christina had been busily engaged in undermining their\r\nloyalty. In the month of June, 1843, Brigadier Prim raised the cry\r\nof \"Down with Espartero,\" to which his troops responded eagerly. The\r\nrevolution spread rapidly. Whilst regiment after regiment deserted\r\nthe cause of the Regent, Narvaez appeared before Madrid at the head\r\nof a division. After a feeble resistance on the part of the national\r\nmilitia the capital opened its gates. In the south meanwhile, on July\r\n29, Espartero, having been abandoned by his troops, embarked at Cadiz\r\non a British ship, and sought refuge in England, where he was feasted\r\nby the City of London and acclaimed by the populace.\r\n\r\nFor some weeks prior to these events the threatening aspect of\r\naffairs had been a frequent subject of discussion between Louis\r\nPhilippe, M. Guizot, and Lord Cowley. Both the King and his minister\r\nhad but one remedy to suggest for the many ills from which Spain\r\nwas suffering. Espartero, they declared, would speedily find that\r\nall his difficulties would disappear, were he to devote his whole\r\nattention to effecting the marriage of Isabella with a Bourbon.\r\nIf England desired to see the dangers now threatening the Regent\r\naverted, let her join with France in urging him to adopt this\r\npolicy.[747] Aberdeen, however, declined to entertain this request.\r\nThe matter, he maintained, was one in which no Foreign Power had a\r\nright to interfere, whilst, \"as to whether the proposed marriage\r\nwould be likely to answer the expectations of those who counselled\r\nit, Her Majesty's government did not feel called upon to express\r\nan opinion.\"[748] But as the situation in Spain daily increased in\r\ngravity, Lord Cowley became persuaded that a fresh complication was to\r\nbe apprehended. Should Espartero be overthrown, he warned his chief,\r\nit was greatly to be feared that the victorious party would demand the\r\nmarriage of Isabella with a son of Louis Philippe. If such an alliance\r\nwere to be proposed, the French nation would be flattered and might\r\nnot improbably insist upon the offer being accepted, \"even at the risk\r\nof war.\"[749]\r\n\r\nThe downfall of Espartero and the new danger to which Cowley had\r\ndrawn his attention caused Lord Aberdeen's resolution to waver. He\r\nnow proposed that France and England should unite their efforts for\r\nthe purpose of restoring order in Spain. Under the circumstances this\r\nwas practically an intimation that he was prepared to reconsider\r\nhis often-repeated declaration that the marriage of Isabella was an\r\nexclusively Spanish affair. It was certainly interpreted in this sense\r\nby Louis Philippe and M. Guizot, who accepted the offer with the\r\nutmost alacrity. It was their policy to affect the greatest confidence\r\nthat, in their hour of triumph, Christina and her friends would\r\ndefer to the advice of France in all matters. But in their hearts\r\nthey had doubtless grave misgivings upon the subject, and they were,\r\nconsequently, only too delighted to obtain the support of England to\r\ntheir schemes. Marshal Sébastiani was at once despatched to London to\r\nconfer upon the situation.[750] He was to assure Lord Aberdeen that\r\nLouis Philippe would never allow one of his sons to marry the Queen\r\nof Spain. Personally the King would prefer that she should marry a\r\nson of Don Carlos, but he would not oppose her union with any member\r\nof either the Spanish or Neapolitan branch of the House of Bourbon.\r\nScarcely, however, had the marshal arrived in England than it was\r\nannounced that Queen Victoria purposed to pay the king of the French\r\na visit at the Château d'Eu, near le Tréport. Her Majesty was to\r\nbe accompanied by her Foreign Secretary, who would thus be enabled\r\npersonally to discuss matters with M. Guizot.\r\n\r\nThe Queen duly arrived at Eu, on September 2, and prolonged her stay\r\nuntil the 7th, as the guest of the King. In every respect the visit\r\nproved an immense success.[751] Her Majesty's affectionate regard for\r\nLouis Philippe was destined, before long, to diminish greatly, but she\r\nappears always to have looked back with pleasure upon the days spent\r\nin company with his family at Eu.[752] Although social amenities\r\nwere the feature of the visit, Lord Aberdeen and M. Guizot were\r\nenabled to discuss grave matters of State. Both appear to have been\r\nequally satisfied with the result of their informal conferences,[753]\r\nand their agreement upon Spanish affairs was afterwards confirmed\r\nby Aberdeen in an official despatch. \"All that can at present be\r\ndone,\" he wrote, \"is that both governments should act cordially and\r\nunreservedly together, taking for the principle of their conduct\r\nthe real good of Spain, without reference to the supposed separate\r\ninterests of either. . . . Her Majesty's government are still of\r\nopinion that to the Queen and the nation should be left the selection\r\nof the Royal Consort. But they will not be found unwilling to offer\r\nsuch friendly counsel to the Spanish government as may aid them in\r\ncoming to a sound decision. With this view, although Her Majesty's\r\ngovernment cannot admit that the preferable claims of any prince\r\nor family are such as to control the free choice of the Spanish\r\ngovernment, they would be fully disposed to concur in the proposition\r\nof the Cabinet of the Tuileries and to recommend that the selection\r\nof the Queen's Consort should be made from the descendants of Philip\r\nV. . . .\"[754]\r\n\r\nShortly after the conclusion of the Queen's visit to Eu, M. de\r\nJarnac,[755] the French _chargé d'affaires_ in London, was the guest\r\nof Lord Aberdeen at Haddo. On one occasion his host placed in his\r\nhands a letter in which he referred to the \"cordial understanding,\"\r\nwhich he now believed had been established between France and\r\nEngland.[756] This designation struck M. Guizot as singularly happy,\r\nand both he and Louis Philippe henceforward constantly employed it to\r\ndescribe the complete accord existing between the French and British\r\ngovernments.\r\n\r\nAn occasion quickly arose which enabled England to show that \"the\r\ncordial understanding\" was, so far as she was concerned, no diplomatic\r\nfiction. The Duc de Bordeaux, more commonly known by the title of\r\nComte de Chambord which he shortly afterwards assumed, arrived in\r\nLondon, towards the end of November. The prince was the posthumous\r\nson of the Duc de Berri and the sole surviving male representative\r\nof the elder branch of the Bourbons. No sooner was he installed in\r\nthe house, which had been taken for him in Belgrave Square, than\r\nhundreds of French legitimists flocked to London. They were for the\r\nmost part members of the old noble families, but among the pilgrims\r\nwas M. Berryer, the distinguished advocate and parliamentary orator.\r\nEven old Chateaubriand, who since the Revolution of July had taken no\r\npart in politics, journeyed to London to testify his devotion to the\r\nprince, whom he and his party acclaimed as _Henri V. King of France\r\nand Navarre_.[757] These proceedings aroused considerable excitement\r\nin France and caused Louis Philippe and his ministers some uneasiness.\r\nThe French ambassador had already been instructed to urge that Queen\r\nVictoria should refuse to receive the young prince, on the ground that\r\nit was the evident intention of his adherents to give to his visit the\r\ncharacter of a political demonstration against the House of Orleans.\r\nThe Queen[758] had promptly signified her readiness to comply with\r\nthis demand. It was not possible, however, to accede to a further\r\nrequest, made after the arrival of the Duc de Bordeaux in London,\r\nthat the proceedings in Belgrave Square should be forcibly put a\r\nstop to, seeing that they in no way infringed the law of England. An\r\nintimation was, nevertheless, conveyed to His Royal Highness that\r\nHer Majesty greatly disliked these demonstrations and would, in\r\nconsequence, be pleased to hear that he had decided to curtail his\r\nstay in London. This message produced the required effect. The Duc de\r\nBordeaux, a few days later, departed from Belgrave Square, and, during\r\nthe remainder of the time which he spent in England, his conduct was\r\nirreproachable.[759]\r\n\r\nThe promptitude with which the Queen and her government had responded\r\nto his wishes was very gratifying to Louis Philippe. In their Speeches\r\nfrom the Throne, both Sovereigns, at the opening of their respective\r\nParliaments, alluded to \"the cordial understanding\" which had been\r\nestablished between their governments. Nevertheless, before the close\r\nof the session of 1844, the two countries were once more upon the\r\nbrink of war. In the year 1839, a company had been formed at Nantes\r\nfor the purpose of founding a French colony in New Zealand. The\r\nundertaking was supported by the government, which proposed annexing\r\nboth islands. But, before the arrival of the French expedition,\r\nCaptain Hobson proclaimed the sovereignty of Her Britannic Majesty\r\nover New Zealand, and its acquisition was duly notified in the\r\n_London Gazette_ of October 2, 1840. The French government bowed\r\nbefore the accomplished fact, but prepared to seek another outlet in\r\nthe Pacific. The following year, accordingly, a squadron, under the\r\ncommand of Admiral Dupetit-Thouars, was dispatched to take possession\r\nof the Marquesas Islands, where it was proposed to establish a penal\r\ncolony. Not content, however, with carrying out his instructions the\r\nadmiral, upon his own responsibility, proceeded to declare a French\r\nprotectorate over Tahiti, the most important of the islands of the\r\nSociety group. More than fifty years before, Tahiti had been visited\r\nby the first English missionaries. Owing to their unremitting efforts,\r\nthe islanders had gradually been converted to the Protestant religion\r\nand had acquired civilized habits. On two occasions the Sovereign,\r\nQueen Pomare, had offered to place herself under the protection of the\r\nBritish flag, but both Canning and Palmerston had declined to accede\r\nto her proposal. In August, 1842, Admiral Dupetit-Thouars anchored off\r\nthe island. He came to exact reparation for the alleged ill-treatment\r\nof two French priests. He demanded a large indemnity and threatened\r\na bombardment, unless payment were made within twenty-four hours. It\r\nwas altogether out of the power of Queen Pomare to comply with these\r\nconditions. Resistance was, however, out of the question. By the\r\nadvice of the French consul, M. Meerenhout, she begged to be allowed\r\nto place herself under the protection of France. It was M. Meerenhout\r\nwho was supposed to have counselled the French admiral to make his\r\ndescent upon the island.[760]\r\n\r\nThe admiral's report of his proceedings at Tahiti afforded little\r\nsatisfaction either to the King or to M. Guizot.[761] But to have\r\ndisavowed him would have exposed them to the charge of truckling\r\nto England--an accusation which would probably have proved fatal\r\nto the existence of the government. The establishment of a French\r\nprotectorate over the islands was, accordingly, published in the\r\n_Moniteur_ of March 20, 1843. The announcement was much resented\r\nin England. It was not possible, however, for England to object to\r\nFrance assuming a responsibility which she herself had twice declined\r\nto undertake. Lord Aberdeen's communications with M. Guizot on the\r\nsubject were, consequently, confined to the expression of a hope that\r\nthe British missionaries would not be interfered with, and that the\r\nsovereign rights of Queen Pomare would be respected. With both these\r\nrequests the French government readily promised to comply.[762] But,\r\nin the meantime, affairs at Tahiti had not been progressing smoothly.\r\n\r\nWhen the Queen was induced to invoke the protection of France, Mr.\r\nPritchard, the British consul, was absent from the island on a visit\r\nto Australia. Pritchard had, for a long time past, been engaged in\r\nmissionary work and in trading in the South Seas. According to his\r\nown statement, however, upon his appointment to the post of consul at\r\nTahiti, he had severed his connection with the Methodist missionary\r\nsociety of which he had been a member.[763] Meerenhout, the French\r\nconsul, on the other hand, was an ardent Roman Catholic, but, like\r\nhis British colleague, he too combined the business of trading with\r\nhis official duties.[764] Racial prejudice, sectarian zeal and trade\r\nrivalry account sufficiently for the bitter enmity which existed\r\nbetween the two men. The news of Admiral Dupetit-Thouars' proceedings\r\nreached Pritchard at Sidney, and his own correspondence shows that he\r\nstarted upon his return journey with the intention of doing everything\r\nin his power to induce the British government \"to interfere\" and with\r\nthe expectation of finding \"many difficulties to encounter.\"[765]\r\nHis first act upon his arrival at Tahiti was to instigate Queen\r\nPomare, over whom he appears to have had great influence, to write\r\nto Her Britannic Majesty. In this curious document Queen Pomare,\r\nafter inviting her \"sister friend\" to commiserate with her in the\r\ndifficulties in which she was involved with the French, begged her\r\n\"to send a large ship of war\" to her assistance. The circumstances\r\nunder which the demand for French protection had been extorted from\r\nher were narrated, much space being devoted to the part played in the\r\ntransaction by M. Meerenhout, \"a very bad and troublesome man.\"[766]\r\n\r\nIt was evident to Lord Aberdeen that the attitude adopted by Mr.\r\nPritchard might at any moment produce some disagreeable incident, the\r\ndanger of a chance collision being enhanced by the ill-feeling which\r\nprevailed between the French and British naval officers. He decided,\r\ntherefore, to appoint Major-General Miller, upon whose prudence and\r\njudgment he could depend, consul-general of the Pacific Islands,\r\nand to place under his orders all the British consuls in the South\r\nSeas. At the same time, he sent off instructions to Mr. Pritchard\r\nenjoining him to recommend a prudent line of conduct to Queen Pomare\r\nand carefully \"to avoid any expression calculated to encourage her\r\nor her chiefs to expect assistance from England.\" Her Majesty's\r\ngovernment, whilst strongly disapproving the action of the French\r\nauthorities at Tahiti and deploring the humiliations inflicted upon\r\nthe Queen, \"was precluded from interfering authoritatively on her\r\nbehalf.\"[767] But, before this despatch could reach its destination,\r\nAdmiral Dupetit-Thouars reappeared at Tahiti. On this occasion he had\r\nreturned to complain of some incident connected with the hoisting\r\nof a flag. After a few days spent in investigating the matter, he\r\npronounced the islanders to be animated by a thoroughly bad spirit.\r\nOn November 6, 1843, Queen Pomare was declared deposed, and Tahiti\r\na French possession. Having issued this proclamation the admiral\r\nproceeded to land troops and to occupy the island. In his despatch to\r\nhis government, explaining the reasons which had induced him to take\r\nthis step, he imputed the chief blame for the unrest of the natives to\r\nMr. Pritchard.[768]\r\n\r\nThe news of these events reached Europe in the month of February,\r\n1844, and evoked a great outburst of indignation in England. Louis\r\nPhilippe and M. Guizot were again placed in a most embarrassing\r\nsituation. Should they refuse to uphold the action of the admiral,\r\ntheir conduct would be assailed on all sides as a cowardly betrayal\r\nof French interests at the bidding of England. On the other hand, the\r\nratification of his act, if it should not entail war, must certainly\r\nput an end to \"the cordial understanding,\" the maintenance of which,\r\nfor the present, was essential to the successful execution of their\r\nSpanish policy. Of these two alternatives, the second unquestionably\r\npresented the greatest disadvantages. At a Cabinet Council, on\r\nFebruary 25, it was decided to adhere to the protectorate, but to\r\ndisavow the last proceedings of Admiral Thouars and to reinstate\r\nQueen Pomare in the sovereignty of which she had been deprived.[769]\r\nA few weeks later, on April 10, Lord Aberdeen informed Mr. Pritchard\r\nthat he would be transferred to the Navigator Islands. In deciding to\r\nremove him from Tahiti, the government in no way desired to express\r\ndisapprobation of his past conduct, but, for the sake both of his own\r\ncomfort and of the maintenance of good relations with France, it was\r\nfelt to be advisable to replace him by some person who had not been\r\nconnected with the transactions of the past two years.[770] This\r\nmeasure of precaution was, however, of no avail. A month before the\r\ndespatch of these instructions Mr. Pritchard had departed from Tahiti,\r\nbut under very different circumstances from those contemplated by Lord\r\nAberdeen. The disavowal of Admiral Thouars was made the subject of a\r\nfierce attack in the Chamber upon the Soult-Guizot Cabinet. In the\r\ncourse of the debates, certain deputies displayed great hostility to\r\nEngland and indulged in much intemperate language. This ebullition\r\nof temper was not treated very seriously in England. But it was a\r\ndifferent matter when the Prince de Joinville, who was a strong\r\nsupporter of Admiral Thouars, saw fit to publish a pamphlet, in which\r\nthe question of a war with Great Britain was discussed in all its\r\nbearings. Only the year before His Royal Highness had been the guest\r\nof Queen Victoria at Windsor, and the appearance of his work, entitled\r\n_Note sur l'état des forces navales de la France_, created a most\r\ndisagreeable impression at Court, upon the government and upon all\r\nclasses of the people. Louis Philippe, who had never authorized the\r\npublication of his son's imprudent pamphlet, was genuinely distressed\r\nand did all in his power to suppress it.[771]\r\n\r\nPublic attention, however, was speedily diverted from the Prince\r\nde Joinville to the Tsar. Suddenly, on May 31, 1844, the Court was\r\ninformed that Nicholas would arrive on a visit to England within the\r\nnext twenty-four hours. At Ascot races and at the various festivities\r\nwhich were hastily arranged in his honour, his appearance excited\r\nuniversal curiosity. On every occasion it was plainly his intention\r\nto impress, not only the Court and high society, but all classes of\r\nthe people with the sincerity of his desire to establish the most\r\nfriendly relations between his empire and Great Britain.[772] To\r\nPeel, Aberdeen and Wellington, with whom he had some confidential\r\nconversations, he was at pains to contrast his respect and affection\r\nfor England with the dislike and the contempt with which he regarded\r\nLouis Philippe, M. Guizot, and the French nation generally. Sir Robert\r\nPeel, however, appears to have told him plainly that he and his\r\ncolleagues were most desirous that, at the death of Louis Philippe,\r\nhis crown should pass to his next heir in the Orleans line without\r\ndisturbance or opposition. But having given emphatic expression to his\r\nhatred of the July Monarchy, Nicholas put forward a distinct proposal.\r\nTurkey was sick, very sick, upon the point of death. It would be a\r\ncritical moment when the Ottoman empire should break up completely.\r\nNevertheless, he apprehended danger only from the ambitious and\r\naggressive spirit of the French. Let, therefore, England, Austria and\r\nRussia agree to act in concert, without reference to France, and all\r\nwould be well.[773] The British ministers would not appear altogether\r\nto have rejected this proposition. But it is difficult to believe\r\nthe story[774] that distinct pledges on the subject were given, and\r\nthat Nicholas, in consequence, was tempted to embark upon those\r\nmeasures which were to result in the Crimean war. It is unnecessary,\r\nhowever, to discuss here whether the conferences of 1844 were in any\r\ndegree responsible for the war ten years later. The Tsar's visit had\r\nno immediate effect upon the European situation in general, or upon\r\nFranco-British relations in particular. Nothing that he had said or\r\ndone during his nine days' stay in England had in any way impaired\r\n\"the cordial understanding.\" He had probably a shrewd idea, however,\r\nthat complications in more than one direction would, before long,\r\ngreatly endanger its existence. An instinctive perception of coming\r\ntrouble may have been the secret of his sudden determination to visit\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nOn June 6, three days before the departure of the Tsar, Aberdeen was\r\ninformed officially that French troops might not improbably be ordered\r\nto enter the territory of the Emperor of Morocco.[775] The famous Arab\r\nchieftain, Abd-el-Kader, with whom the French had been at war for a\r\nlong time past, had recently sought refuge within the frontiers of\r\nthe Moorish empire. On former occasions, when hard pressed, he had\r\neluded capture in this manner. Representations had frequently been\r\nmade at Fez, on the subject of the facilities which were alleged to\r\nhave been afforded him for renewing the struggle. These complaints,\r\nhowever, had hitherto produced little or no effect, and Marshal\r\nBugeaud, the governor of Algiers, consequently urged the adoption of\r\nstronger measures. Neither Louis Philippe nor his ministers desired\r\nto begin hostilities, but, on May 30, 1844, a French force, under\r\nGeneral de Lamoricière, was attacked by a body of Moroccan cavalry\r\nupon the Algerian side of the frontier. The situation at once assumed\r\na very grave character. The French consul at Tangier was instructed to\r\nproceed to Fez to demand the punishment of the Moorish commander, the\r\nexpulsion of Abd-el-Kader, and the withdrawal of the troops assembled\r\nclose to the French frontier. At the same time, a squadron under\r\nthe Prince de Joinville was despatched to Moroccan waters[776] and\r\npreparations were made for reinforcing Marshal Bugeaud.\r\n\r\nThe news that hostilities were impending caused great dissatisfaction\r\nin England. Ministers were questioned upon the subject in both\r\nHouses and the press commented upon the affair with much acrimony.\r\nUnder pretext of obtaining redress for some more or less imaginary\r\ngrievance, Morocco, it was predicted, would be invaded and, without\r\ndoubt, permanently occupied. The fate which had befallen the Dey\r\nof Algiers was assuredly reserved for the Emperor of Morocco. This\r\ngeneral feeling of uneasiness and suspicion was increased by the\r\nselection of the Prince de Joinville, the author of the recent\r\npamphlet, for the command of the squadron sent to cruise off\r\nTangier.[777] The two governments, nevertheless, maintained their\r\nfriendly communications. M. Guizot gave the most positive assurances\r\nthat every effort would be made to settle the affair peacefully, and\r\nundertook that, should hostilities break out, Tangier[778] would\r\nnot be bombarded nor would any portion of Morocco be appropriated.\r\nAberdeen was not prepared to deny that the French government had grave\r\ncause for complaint. Although it had been considered necessary for\r\nthe protection of British interests that a squadron should be sent to\r\nthe Moroccan coast, the British fleet in those waters, he promised\r\nthe French ambassador, would be numerically inferior to that of the\r\nPrince de Joinville.[779] Had he regarded it as in the smallest degree\r\nprobable that his proposal would be accepted, he would, doubtless,\r\nhave suggested that England should act as mediator in the quarrel.\r\nBut, in spite of the fact that \"the cordial understanding\" had\r\nbeen loudly proclaimed, the idea of allowing England to interfere\r\nwould have been so unpopular in France that no government could\r\nhave ventured to entertain it. Under these circumstances Aberdeen\r\ncould only direct Mr. Drummond Hay, the British consul at Tangier,\r\nto proceed to Fez and to endeavour to prevail upon the Emperor to\r\nacquiesce in the French demands. Notwithstanding that the Moors had\r\na second time attacked the column of General de Lamoricière, strong\r\nhopes were entertained, at the end of July, that actual war might\r\nstill be averted.\r\n\r\nOn July 30, 1844, _The Times_ announced the startling news that Mr.\r\nPritchard, the British consul at Tahiti, had arrived in England,\r\nafter having been arrested, cast into a dungeon and finally expelled\r\nfrom the island by the French military authorities. In answer to a\r\nquestion put to him, the following night, by Sir Charles Napier in\r\nthe House of Commons, Sir Robert Peel declared that, if the reports\r\nwhich the government had received were true, \"a gross outrage\" had\r\nundoubtedly been perpetrated. But, when the next day M. de Jarnac\r\nspoke to Lord Aberdeen on the subject, he was authorized to inform\r\nM. Guizot that the Prime Minister could not admit that his words had\r\nbeen correctly reported in the morning papers.[780] The first accounts\r\nof Mr. Pritchard's case would seem to have been somewhat inaccurate.\r\nWhen all the circumstances were brought to light, it was evident that\r\nthe British government had just cause to complain of the treatment\r\nwhich he had experienced, but it was, at the same time, no less clear\r\nthat his own conduct had been most injudicious. Immediately upon the\r\nproclamation of French sovereignty over Tahiti, Mr. Pritchard struck\r\nhis flag and sent a protest to Admiral Thouars. From this moment he\r\nassumed so anomalous a position that it is not surprising that the\r\nFrench governor, Admiral Bruat, should have refused to recognize\r\nit. According to Pritchard's own statement, he \"continued to perform\r\nhis functions as consul, except in corresponding with the French\r\nauthorities, and continued to act as the accredited agent of Great\r\nBritain to Queen Pomare.\" Furthermore, he appears to have invited the\r\ndeposed Queen to take up her abode in his house, where she stayed\r\nuntil, \"considering it not safe to remain on shore,\" she decided\r\nto go on board H.M.S. _Dublin_, which was lying in the harbour of\r\nPapeite.[781]\r\n\r\nThe natives meanwhile were growing restless and evincing a\r\ndetermination to resist the imposition of foreign rule. Their\r\nhostility, in the opinion of the French officers, was to be ascribed\r\nmainly to the pernicious example set them by Mr. Pritchard. No event\r\nof importance, however, occurred until March 2, 1844, on which date,\r\nduring the absence of the governor from Papeite, a French sentry was\r\nalleged to have been assaulted by a native. M. d'Aubigny, the senior\r\nofficer on the spot, thereupon proclaimed martial law throughout the\r\nisland and decreed the arrest of Mr. Pritchard, who was forthwith\r\nimprisoned in an underground chamber beneath the guard room of a\r\nblock house. After he had been in captivity for four days and had\r\nendured much discomfort, Admiral Bruat returned to Papeite. The\r\ngovernor, perceiving at once that his subordinate had acted with undue\r\nprecipitation, ordered the release of Mr. Pritchard and his removal\r\nto a British vessel, _The Cormorant_, which, on March 13, quitted the\r\nisland and carried him to Valparaiso.[782]\r\n\r\n\"Never since I have been in this country,\" wrote M. de Jarnac, \"have I\r\nseen anything to equal the excitement which the news from Tahiti has\r\naroused. The religious party took up the case at once. Meetings of the\r\n'_Saints_' have been convened, violent speeches have been delivered\r\nall over the country, and pictures representing certain of the\r\nevents connected with the affair have been exhibited. The papers are\r\nvery violent. Lord Aberdeen appears to be growing more apprehensive\r\ndaily. He is convinced that some form of satisfaction must be given.\r\nHe wishes, however, to leave the initiative of proposing it to\r\nYour Excellency: but I happen to know that the plan of sending Mr.\r\nPritchard straight back to Tahiti has been under discussion by the\r\nCabinet.\"[783] In France the excitement was scarcely less intense.\r\nThe newspapers, with one accord, called loudly upon the government\r\nto stand by its officers, and to deny Great Britain any kind of\r\nreparation, even at the risk of war. The production of _Charles_ IV.\r\nat the Opera House evoked a furious manifestation of hostility to\r\nEngland. Fortunately, however, the session was brought to a close on\r\nAugust 5, and, in the meantime, M. Guizot resolutely refused to make\r\nany statement about the affair in the Chambers.[784]\r\n\r\nBut although the prorogation afforded him some relief, M. Guizot\r\nwas, nevertheless, in a position of extreme difficulty. His friends\r\nunceasingly warned him that he must resist the demands of England,\r\nor be prepared to succumb to the outburst of popular indignation\r\nwhich any concessions would provoke.[785] Under these circumstances\r\nhe decided that complete inaction was, for the present, the safest\r\ncourse to adopt. \"The greater the excitement,\" he instructed Jarnac,\r\n\"the more necessary it becomes to allow it time to cool down. For\r\nthe moment we must abstain from all discussion of the subject.\"\r\nNevertheless, when interviewing Aberdeen, he would do well to\r\nbring forward those arguments which he himself was employing in\r\nhis conversations with Lord Cowley. Stress should be laid upon\r\nthe fact that Pritchard had ceased to act as consul. As a private\r\nindividual whose presence was regarded as prejudicial to good order,\r\nthe colonial authorities had a universally acknowledged right to\r\nexpel him. At the same time, however, it could not be denied that\r\n\"some of the proceedings which had attended his removal had been\r\nirregular. . . .\"[786]\r\n\r\nHitherto Lord Aberdeen had studiously refrained from formulating any\r\nprecise demand. But, on August 13, after a meeting of the Cabinet,\r\nhe directed Cowley to give M. Guizot clearly to understand that,\r\nunless satisfaction in some shape were voluntarily offered, he must\r\ntransmit \"a formal and detailed statement of the grounds upon which\r\nHer Majesty's government founded its expectations of redress.\"[787]\r\nIn England anger at the continued silence of the French government\r\nwas rising to a dangerous pitch. On August 14, at a meeting at Exeter\r\nHall, at which Mr. Pritchard himself was present, men, who in most\r\ninternational disputes would have advocated peace at any price,\r\ngave utterance to the most warlike sentiments. Two days later came\r\nthe news that the answer of the Emperor of Morocco to the French\r\n_ultimatum_ having been considered unsatisfactory, Tangier had been\r\nbombarded. \"War,\" wrote M. de Jarnac, \"is now generally regarded as\r\ninevitable.\"[788] Lord Cowley was instructed to represent that \"the\r\nattack upon Tangier, after the repeated assurance of M. Guizot that it\r\nwould be respected under all circumstances, had greatly surprised the\r\nBritish government . . . any occupation of the coast of Morocco could\r\nnot fail to be viewed in a very serious light by Great Britain, and\r\nmust lead to evils of great magnitude.[789]\"\r\n\r\nM. Guizot, however, adhered resolutely to his plan \"of allowing time\r\nfor the excitement to cool down\" in England, and he still forbore\r\nto offer any satisfaction for the treatment to which Mr. Pritchard\r\nhad been subjected. Both he and the King appear to have strangely\r\nunderestimated the intensity of the resentment to which the Tahiti\r\naffair had given rise. \"The two governments,\" he informed Jarnac,\r\n\"were not yet agreed in their appreciation of the facts imputed to Mr.\r\nPritchard,\" and it was, consequently, impossible for the present to\r\ndiscuss the nature of the reparation which might be due to him. Again,\r\na few days later, he directed him to inform Lord Aberdeen that his\r\ndespatch of the 13th would have to be deliberated upon by the Council,\r\n\"many of the members of which were absent from Paris.\"[790] Meanwhile,\r\nthe press of both countries was busily engaged in embittering the\r\nquarrel. Some highly offensive attacks upon the private life of Mr.\r\nPritchard appeared in the French papers, whilst _The Times_ published\r\nletters, purporting to have been written by naval officers who had\r\nwitnessed the bombardment of Tangier, in which the most insulting\r\ndoubts were cast upon the seamanship of the Prince de Joinville and\r\nupon the fighting qualities of the French sailors.[791] M. Guizot,\r\nhowever, continued to display a lofty indifference to the popular\r\nexcitement on both sides of the Channel. He was content to enjoin M.\r\nde Jarnac to impress upon Lord Aberdeen that it \"would be a disgrace,\r\nwere the peace of the world to be disturbed on account of Pritchard,\r\nPomare and d'Aubigny.\"[792]\r\n\r\nBut the young diplomatist in charge of the French embassy in London\r\nwas, fortunately, alive to the dangers of the situation. Ever since\r\nthe first arrival of the news from Tahiti, M. de Jarnac had sought\r\nto convince his government that the affair was highly serious. Nor\r\nwas it only to M. Guizot that he addressed his warnings. Having been\r\ncharged to deliver a letter from the King to Prince Albert, he took\r\nthe opportunity, thus afforded him, of communicating his fears to\r\nLouis Philippe himself. He begged him to believe that at a recent\r\nCabinet Council Lord Aberdeen had been the only minister to oppose a\r\nlarge increase of the navy. \"Were it not for the confidence reposed\r\nin the wisdom of Your Majesty, the situation would resemble in many\r\nunfortunate particulars that of 1840.\"[793] He daily adjured M. Guizot\r\nto reflect most seriously upon the danger of deferring any longer his\r\nreply to the British government. \"People in England are discussing\r\nalliances and talk of nothing but war. M. de Nesselrode is staying at\r\nBrighton. He affects to be unconcerned with politics. But it is said\r\nthat he remains here in order that he may be upon the spot, should\r\na serious disagreement arise between France and England. If that be\r\nhis object, fortune may have favoured his designs in a remarkable\r\nmanner.\"[794]\r\n\r\nThe British Parliament was to be prorogued on September 5, and,\r\nunless an announcement could be made in the Queen's Speech that a\r\nsettlement had been arrived at, war, it was generally felt, could\r\nscarcely be avoided. Even M. Guizot began to realize that, if the\r\npeace was to be preserved, he must propose some form of reparation.\r\nOn several occasions Jarnac had hinted that the British government\r\nmight very possibly be satisfied, were a pecuniary indemnity to be\r\noffered to Mr. Pritchard.[795] Unquestionably, the payment of a sum\r\nof money would be regarded in France as less objectionable than most\r\nother forms of reparation. But, having proposed to the King and the\r\nCabinet that the affair should be settled on those lines, and having\r\nobtained their assent, M. Guizot still deferred transmitting an offer\r\nof pecuniary compensation to London. In a despatch, dated August 29, a\r\ncopy of which was to be given to Lord Aberdeen, he stoutly maintained\r\nthe right of the authorities at Tahiti to expel Mr. Pritchard from\r\nthe island. His imprisonment, however, and certain other acts of\r\nwhich M. d'Aubigny had been guilty, could not be defended, and that\r\nofficer would, in consequence, receive in due course a notification\r\nof the censure which the government had passed upon his conduct. He\r\ncould concede no more, he told Lord Cowley, and he fully intended\r\nto retire from office, if further redress were to be demanded.[796]\r\nNevertheless, he appears privately to have informed M. de Jarnac\r\nthat he was transmitting a second despatch, containing an offer of\r\na money payment to Mr. Pritchard, which he was to communicate to\r\nLord Aberdeen, should the British government regard the reprimand,\r\nadministered to M. d'Aubigny, as an inadequate reparation. This,\r\nas he doubtless expected, was the view taken of his first despatch\r\nby the Cabinet in London. Jarnac, in consequence, lost no time in\r\nassuring Lord Aberdeen that an offer of a pecuniary indemnity would\r\nbe made. Had he not taken this responsibility upon himself, he was\r\nconvinced that the customary announcement that \"friendly relations\r\nexisted with other countries\" would have been omitted from the Queen's\r\nSpeech, and \"the whole of Europe would have been thrown into a state\r\nof perturbation.\" On the following day, September 4, he placed in the\r\nhands of Lord Aberdeen the official offer of the French government\r\nto indemnify Mr. Pritchard by the payment of a sum of money, the\r\namount of which was to be determined by the admirals commanding the\r\nFrench and British fleets in the Pacific. Aberdeen pronounced the\r\nproposed satisfaction \"rather slender,\" but assured him that he\r\nmight now consider the matter as settled.[797] Twenty-four hours\r\nlater Parliament was prorogued, and the happy termination of the\r\nPritchard affair was announced in the Speech from the Throne. \"The\r\ndanger,\" wrote Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians, had been\r\n\"imminent.\"[798]\r\n\r\nThe settlement of the Tahiti dispute was quickly followed by the\r\nwelcome news that France had concluded peace with the Emperor of\r\nMorocco. Marshal Bugeaud, on August 14, had won a decisive victory\r\nover the Moors on the river Isly, whilst at sea the Prince de\r\nJoinville, after silencing the forts of Tangier, had, on August 15,\r\ndestroyed the defences of Mogador. Neither the King nor M. Guizot\r\ndesired to prosecute the campaign any further. They had obtained\r\nall the advantages which they could hope to derive from active\r\nhostilities. They had proved that they were not to be deterred, by\r\nthe irritation which their action had called forth in England, from\r\ninflicting a severe punishment upon the Moors. The national thirst\r\nfor military glory had been sufficiently appeased by the successes\r\nwhich had already been achieved. Under these circumstances, they were\r\nnot disposed to be exacting in their conditions. Provided the Emperor\r\nwould submit to the terms set forth in their original _ultimatum_,\r\nthey would not insist upon an indemnity, but would recall their troops\r\nand forthwith suspend hostilities. The Court of Fez promptly acceded\r\nto these moderate demands, and, on September 10, 1844, a treaty of\r\npeace was signed at Tangier.\r\n\r\nThe cessation of hostilities between France and Morocco removed much\r\nof the resentment which recent events in the Mediterranean and in\r\nthe Pacific had aroused in England. Notwithstanding that, at the end\r\nof August, 1844, the two countries had been upon the brink of war,\r\nLouis Philippe, early in October, was enabled to return the visit\r\nwhich Queen Victoria, the year before, had paid him at the Château\r\nd'Eu. During his stay in England the King was installed with much\r\nmagnificence as a Knight of the Garter at Windsor, and, on every\r\noccasion on which he was seen in public, was accorded a hearty welcome\r\nby the people. Isabella's marriage still occupied the foremost place\r\nin his thoughts. That question, however, had made but little progress,\r\nin spite of the overthrow of Espartero and of the triumph of Christina\r\nand the _Moderados_.\r\n\r\nAfter the flight of the Regent Spain had passed under the rule of\r\nRamon Maria Narvaez, the Captain-General of Castile, an able and\r\nunscrupulous adventurer. The Liberals, who had joined with the\r\n_Moderados_ in encompassing the downfall of Espartero, were quickly\r\nforced to realize the magnitude of their folly. Parliamentary\r\ngovernment was practically abolished, and any attempts to resist\r\nthe authority of the dictator were mercilessly repressed. Over two\r\nhundred executions for political offences, during the space of one\r\nyear, broke the spirit of the democratic party, and gave the country\r\nan outward appearance of tranquillity. The difficulty of selecting a\r\nRegent in the place of Espartero had, in the meantime, been overcome\r\nby the unconstitutional declaration of the Cortes, on November 8,\r\n1843, that the Queen was of full age, although she had only entered\r\nupon her fourteenth year. The question having thus been settled,\r\nChristina, in the spring of 1844, left Paris and returned to Madrid,\r\naccompanied by her husband, Nuñoz, henceforward to be known as the\r\nDuke of Rianzarez.\r\n\r\nIn 1844 the eldest son of Don Carlos, the two sons of Don Francisco\r\nde Paula, and Count Trapani, the brother of the King of Naples, and\r\nof Christina herself, were, for all practical purposes, the only\r\nunmarried male descendants of Philip V. If, therefore, the principle\r\nproclaimed by Louis Philippe were to be adhered to, Isabella's choice\r\nof a husband must be restricted to these four princes. To each one,\r\nhowever, there were serious objections. Although a suitable candidate\r\nin other respects, the son of Don Carlos was ineligible on political\r\ngrounds.[799] The idea of her daughter's marriage with either of the\r\nsons of Don Francisco de Paula was most distasteful to Christina.\r\nNotwithstanding that their mother, the Infanta Carlotta, was her\r\nsister, she had for a long time past looked upon her as her worst\r\nenemy. Nor had the death of this princess, early in 1844,[800] greatly\r\ndiminished the animosity with which she regarded this branch of the\r\nfamily. But in addition to the feud which had existed for so many\r\nyears between Christina and their mother, both young men for different\r\nreasons were objectionable in themselves. The appearance of the elder,\r\nDon Francisco de Asis, Duke of Cadiz, was ridiculous and effeminate,\r\nand he, moreover, was generally believed to be impotent. Christina,\r\nhowever, appears to have regarded the loudly professed Liberalism\r\nof Don Enrique, Duke of Seville, as a more serious objection to his\r\nmarriage with her daughter than the physical unfitness of his elder\r\nbrother. The fourth candidate, Count Trapani, was an unattractive,\r\nbackward youth of sixteen, whose life had hitherto been spent within\r\nthe walls of a Jesuit College at Rome. The difficulties, however,\r\nin the way of his marriage with Isabella were mainly political.\r\nMetternich greatly disliked the notion of a closer connection between\r\nthe absolute Court of Naples and the constitutional monarchy of\r\nSpain.[801] Furthermore, the Spanish people despised the Neapolitans,\r\nand could not fail to resent the idea of selecting the Royal Consort\r\nfrom the Neapolitan branch of the Bourbons.[802]\r\n\r\nCount Trapani, nevertheless, was chosen by Louis Philippe and M.\r\nGuizot as the most suitable husband for Isabella. In the summer of\r\n1844, the French agents, both at Naples and at Madrid, were instructed\r\nto further his candidature by all means in their power.[803]\r\nChristina's feelings on the subject cannot be precisely determined.\r\nThere can be little doubt, however, that she never gave the project\r\nher hearty support. Probably she realized that it was impracticable\r\nby reason of the dislike with which it was certain to be regarded by\r\nSpaniards of all classes. It is significant that one of her first\r\nacts, after her return to Madrid, was to assure Mr. Bulwer that she\r\nhad no intention of submitting to the dictation of Louis Philippe,\r\nand that she still hoped to arrange the marriage of Isabella with\r\nLeopold, the son of Prince Ferdinand of Coburg.[804] Henry Bulwer had\r\nbeen appointed British minister at Madrid, soon after the downfall\r\nof the Regent. Aberdeen appears to have been anxious that a man,\r\nless wedded than Aston to Palmerstonian traditions, should carry\r\nout the new policy of cordially co-operating with France for the\r\ngeneral welfare of Spain. The French government, once Espartero had\r\nbeen expelled, had hastened to resume normal diplomatic relations\r\nwith the Court of Isabella. Accordingly, almost at the same time as\r\nBulwer was sent to Madrid, the Comte Bresson, whose proceedings at\r\nBrussels in 1831 have been related, was transferred from Berlin to the\r\nSpanish capital as French ambassador. Far from acting harmoniously\r\ntogether, however, they appear to have cordially disliked each other.\r\nBresson is described by Bulwer,[805] in his _Life of Palmerston_, as\r\na person sprung from the middle classes, and \"consequently vulgarly\r\npre-occupied with his position as ambassador.\" Bresson,[806] for his\r\npart, considered his English colleague as \"_pas élevé_,\" and as a man\r\nagainst whom he must constantly be on his guard, lest he should take\r\nsome liberty with him.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the year of 1844, a further complication was added to\r\nthe many difficulties which surrounded the question of the Queen's\r\nmarriage. \"I believe,\" wrote Lord Cowley,[807] \"that Louis Philippe\r\nis thinking of the marriage of Montpensier[808] with the sister of\r\nIsabella.\" The supposition was perfectly correct. It is impossible,\r\nhowever, to say with certainty when the King first decided to put\r\nforward his son as a candidate for the hand of the Infanta Fernanda.\r\nAccording to Guizot,[809] the suggestion was not made until the autumn\r\nof 1844, and it was then propounded, he alleges, for the purpose of\r\nreconciling Christina and the Spanish people to the insignificance\r\nof the Neapolitan alliance. But it was always, he asserts, made\r\nperfectly clear that the Montpensier marriage could not take place\r\nuntil the Queen had married and borne a child. Be that as it may, it\r\nwas not considered advisable to inform Lord Aberdeen of this project.\r\nDuring the next few months, however, the new matrimonial scheme was\r\nthe subject of many rumours, and, in the month of July, 1845, a visit\r\nof the Duke of Rianzarez to Paris was so generally believed to be\r\nconnected with this affair, that it was felt that some explanation\r\nmust be given to the British government.[810] M. Guizot, accordingly,\r\ninformed Mr. Bulwer, who happened to be in Paris on his way to London,\r\nthat he wished Lord Aberdeen to know that \"King Louis Philippe and\r\nQueen Christina were desirous to settle the marriage for private and\r\npersonal reasons into which the Infanta's fortune entered.\" It would\r\nnot take place for some time, he assured him, and in any case not\r\nuntil Isabella had had children.[811]\r\n\r\nOn September 8, 1845, Queen Victoria paid a second visit to Louis\r\nPhilippe at the Château d'Eu. Her Majesty, Prince Albert, Aberdeen and\r\nPeel had been considerably disturbed by the news brought by Bulwer\r\nfrom Paris. But on the very day of the arrival of the Royal party at\r\nEu, both the King and M. Guizot declared to Lord Aberdeen, \"in the\r\nmost positive and explicit manner, that until the Queen was married\r\nand had children, they should consider the Infanta precisely as her\r\nsister, and that any marriage with a French prince would be entirely\r\nout of the question. . . . I distinctly understood,\" wrote Aberdeen\r\nto Peel a few hours after he had received these assurances, \"that it\r\nwas not only a marriage and a child, but children that were necessary\r\nto secure the succession. I thought this was as much as we could\r\ndesire at present, and that the question of a marriage with a French\r\nprince might safely be left to be considered, whenever the contingency\r\ncontemplated should arrive. Many things may happen in the course of a\r\nfew years.\"[812]\r\n\r\nOn the very day that Queen Victoria arrived at Eu, the Duc and the\r\nDuchesse de Nemours and the Duke d'Aumale left Pampeluna, where they\r\nhad been the guests of the Spanish Royal family. The real object\r\nof their visit would never appear to have transpired.[813] Bulwer,\r\nfor reasons which in due course he explained to Aberdeen, was not\r\npresent at Pampeluna, and delayed returning to Spain until the French\r\nprinces had recrossed the frontier. The interview, he understood,\r\nhad been arranged for the purpose of \"pushing on the marriage with\r\nCount Trapani, a marriage most unpopular in the country.\" He had,\r\ntherefore, decided to stay away. By absenting himself, his government\r\nwould not incur \"the odium which must stigmatize all those by whom\r\nthe Neapolitan match may be conceived to have been brought about.\" On\r\nthe other hand, should the visit of the French princes not achieve\r\nthe desired result, they would be unable to impute its failure \"to\r\nthe intrigues of the British minister.\" Upon his return to Madrid,\r\nBulwer experienced great difficulty in obtaining any information\r\nabout the state of affairs. Bresson assured him that Isabella's\r\nhealth \"was declared to be such as to render her marriage for the\r\npresent inopportune.\"[814] Christina gave him to understand that\r\nmatters were still undecided. \"But her language was not that of entire\r\nconfidence, and she seemed divided between the wish to say nothing\r\nand the desire to say enough to prevent any subsequent charge of\r\nwant of frankness.\" Upon the whole, he was inclined to think that\r\nsome plan was contemplated, \"which it was not yet judged expedient\r\nto avow.\"[815] From divers sources he learnt that the Queen-Mother,\r\nBresson and Carini, the Neapolitan ambassador, were suspected of an\r\nintention \"privately to betroth Isabella to Trapani, and to force\r\nhis acceptance upon the Cortes.\" Narvaez had been induced to support\r\ntheir unconstitutional designs, \"in the belief that he would be more\r\nnecessary with an unpopular, than with a popular prince.\"[816]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, M. Bresson at Madrid and M. Guizot in Paris were greatly\r\ndissatisfied with the aspect of affairs. The King of Naples had always\r\nbeen reluctant to allow his brother to be put forward as a suitor\r\nfor the hand of the Queen of Spain. He distrusted Louis Philippe\r\nexceedingly, he was fearful of offending the Court of Vienna, he was\r\non bad terms with his sister Christina, and, in point of fact, had not\r\nofficially acknowledged the sovereignty of Isabella. Nevertheless,\r\nunder the vigorous pressure brought to bear upon him from Paris, he\r\nagreed to renew diplomatic relations with the Court of Madrid, and\r\nto empower his ambassador to discuss his brother's marriage. But,\r\nhaving surmounted the difficulties at Naples, Louis Philippe and\r\nM. Guizot were confronted by more serious obstacles at Madrid. As\r\ntime went on, the unpopularity of the Neapolitan match tended rather\r\nto increase than to diminish. So universal was the dislike to this\r\nconnection that Guizot judged it prudent to warn Bresson to maintain\r\nfriendly relations with Don Francisco de Paula,[817] seeing that it\r\nmight be necessary before long to insist upon Isabella's marriage\r\nwith one of his sons. As the prospects of the Bourbon candidates grew\r\nless favourable the Coburg marriage, greatly to the annoyance of\r\nLouis Philippe, began to be discussed as a necessary alternative. The\r\nimpending visit of Prince Leopold to his brother the King of Portugal\r\ngave rise to many rumours. There was an intrigue on foot, reported\r\nBresson, to promote the chances of that prince, and Bulwer, he was\r\nconvinced, was more or less concerned in it.[818]\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances M. Guizot decided to direct M. de Jarnac to\r\nconfer upon the situation with Lord Aberdeen. He was to intimate to\r\nhim that, in fulfilment of the compact at Eu, he should now bestir\r\nhimself actively on behalf of the Bourbon candidates, and make it\r\nperfectly clear to the Coburgs that no member of their family could be\r\nallowed to marry Isabella. This was more than Aberdeen was prepared\r\nto undertake. He, however, assured M. de Jarnac upon his honour that\r\nthe Coburgs should receive no encouragement either from the Court or\r\nfrom the government, and promised him that they would be advised to\r\nabandon their supposed intention of visiting Madrid.[819] Aberdeen\r\nwas at this time in receipt of Bulwer's despatch of October 30,\r\n1845, informing him of his suspicion that Christina and Narvaez\r\nwere purposing to accomplish the Trapani marriage, in violation of\r\nthe article of the constitution which prescribed that the sovereign\r\nmust communicate his intention of contracting a matrimonial alliance\r\nto the Cortes. He at once replied by charging him to express to the\r\ngeneral the sincere hope of the British government that no such plan\r\nwas under consideration. \"Say to him,\" he wrote in conclusion, \"that\r\nyou are instructed to offer no opposition to the marriage of the Queen\r\nto Trapani, provided it be openly accomplished according to legal\r\nforms, still less are you authorized to espouse the cause of any other\r\ncandidate.\"[820]\r\n\r\nMere friendly neutrality, however, could be of little service to\r\nLouis Philippe and M. Guizot. A further disappointment, moreover,\r\nwas in store for them. At the end of January, 1846, General Narvaez,\r\nwho, as a supporter of the Neapolitan alliance, had been growing\r\nvery unpopular, resigned office after a violent quarrel with his\r\nfellow-ministers.[821] When the news reached Paris that the one man\r\nwho might have effected the Trapani marriage was no longer at the\r\nhead of affairs, it was decided to make another, and a more direct,\r\nattempt to force the British government to take action on behalf\r\nof the Bourbon candidate. Jarnac was, accordingly, supplied with a\r\ndocument, which he was to read to Lord Aberdeen. This extraordinary\r\npaper, known as the _Memorandum of February 27_, 1846, set forth the\r\nfollowing conclusions: \"The Count Trapani is greatly compromised: 1.\r\nBy the demonstration which has been made against him; 2. By the fall\r\nof General Narvaez. The sons of Don Francisco de Paula are greatly\r\ncompromised: 1. By their mistaken conduct; 2. By their intimacy with\r\nthe Radical party; 3. By the dislike of the Queen-Mother and of the\r\nyoung Queen herself to them. The sons of Don Carlos are for the time\r\nout of the question. The actual situation of the descendants of Philip\r\nV. is consequently bad. Efforts are being made to marry Prince Leopold\r\nof Coburg either to the Queen Isabella or to the Infanta Fernanda.\r\nLisbon is the chief seat of these machinations. It is said that Prince\r\nLeopold, who is to leave Lisbon on February 24, intends to visit\r\nMadrid. Many circumstances appear to confirm the truth of this rumour.\r\nIf the present state of affairs be prolonged we may find ourselves\r\ncompelled, in order that our policy in Spain may not receive a check\r\nwhich we are determined not to suffer, to declare ourselves liberated\r\nfrom all engagements with regard to either marriage. Such a situation\r\nwould arise, were the marriage of the Queen or the Infanta with Prince\r\nLeopold of Coburg or with any other prince, not a descendant of Philip\r\nV., to appear probable or imminent. In that case we should take\r\nimmediate steps to ward off the blow by demanding the hand of either\r\nthe Queen or the Infanta for the Duc de Montpensier. We are sincerely\r\ndesirous of averting the necessity of resorting to so extreme a\r\nmeasure. We see only one way in which the crisis can be avoided. The\r\nEnglish Cabinet must co-operate actively with us in promoting the\r\nclaims of one of the descendants of Philip V., no matter which, and in\r\narranging his marriage with Queen Isabella, and in preventing, in the\r\nmeanwhile, the marriage of the Infanta either with Prince Leopold or\r\nwith any other prince, not a descendant of Philip V.\"[822]\r\n\r\nAberdeen appears to have listened in silence and to have made no\r\nprotest against the unwarrantable assumptions contained in this\r\ndocument. No copy of it was given to him, nor would he seem to have\r\nasked for one.[823] Meanwhile, strange events were taking place in\r\nSpain. The Miraflores Cabinet was quickly overthrown and, on March\r\n17, 1846, Narvaez was once more at the head of the government. His\r\nreturn to power was quickly followed by the promulgation of decrees\r\nrestricting the liberty of the press and suspending the sittings of\r\nthe Cortes.[824] Bulwer was convinced that it was decided forthwith\r\nto betroth Isabella to Trapani, regardless of public opinion and of\r\nlegal forms.[825] But, if Narvaez ever contemplated a _coup d'état_\r\nof this nature, he soon relinquished the idea. His tenure of office\r\nwas of very brief duration. On April 5 he was dismissed and ordered\r\nto quit Madrid immediately. The mystery which surrounds these sudden\r\nchanges of government has never been satisfactorily unravelled. It\r\nis certain that they were connected, more or less directly, with\r\nIsabella's marriage. At first sight it would seem as though Christina\r\nhad resolved to discard Narvaez, because she perceived that he\r\nwas powerless to effect the Trapani marriage. Nevertheless, this\r\napparently obvious explanation is probably erroneous. The Queen-Mother\r\nwas never really desirous that her daughter should marry her uncle,\r\nTrapani. But she wished to ruin Narvaez, whose secret aim it was to\r\ndiminish the influence of the Court and of the Church.[826] It is\r\npossible, therefore, that she may have insisted upon his supporting\r\nthe Neapolitan alliance in order simply to discredit him. In this\r\ncrafty fashion she may have hoped to rid herself of the man who, she\r\nhad once declared, \"was more arrogant than Espartero.\"[827]\r\n\r\nOn April 8, 1846, the following message[828] was received in Paris\r\nfrom M. Bresson, who, doubtless, had some person in his employ in\r\nclose attendance upon Isabella. \"_La reine est nubile depuis deux\r\nheures._\"[829] Whether or not this news was communicated to Lord\r\nCowley by M. Guizot, it was certainly known at once at the British\r\nembassy. Christina could no longer invoke physical reasons for\r\ndelaying her daughter's marriage. But, meanwhile, the number of\r\nBourbon candidates was rapidly diminishing. Trapani was too unpopular,\r\nand Don Enrique, Duke of Seville, the younger son of Don Francisco de\r\nPaula, had recently been concerned in an insurrection in Gallicia,\r\nand had been ordered to leave Spain. The only available husband for\r\nIsabella among the descendants of Philip V. was, therefore, Don\r\nEnrique's elder brother, Don Francisco, Duke of Cadiz, whom both\r\nshe and her mother disliked and despised. Christina, under these\r\ncircumstances, resolved to revert to the matrimonial combination\r\nwhich she had constantly regarded as the best. The moment was not\r\nunfavourable for openly defying Louis Philippe. Narvaez, the minister\r\nwho had always been looked upon as the chief tool of the French Court,\r\nwas in disgrace, and Isturiz, his successor, was her devoted servant.\r\nShe accordingly determined to propose to the Duke of Saxe-Coburg that\r\nIsabella should marry his son, Prince Leopold. After informing him of\r\nits contents, she gave the letter containing this offer to Mr. Bulwer,\r\nasking that it might be conveyed to Lisbon by his messenger. The\r\nBritish minister complied with her request and reported the affair to\r\nhis chief.\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen was seriously annoyed, and at once informed M. de\r\nSainte-Aulaire of what had passed, assuring him that he should\r\nadminister a severe rebuke to Mr. Bulwer. Bulwer, he considered, had\r\nviolated his instructions, both in undertaking to transmit the offer\r\nto Lisbon and in concealing Christina's proceedings from M. Bresson.\r\nIn consequence of the strictures passed upon his conduct, Bulwer\r\noffered to resign. Aberdeen, however, in a friendly letter insisted\r\nupon his remaining at his post.[830] A few days later, on June 29,\r\n1846, Sir Robert Peel announced that he and his colleagues had retired\r\nfrom office, and that Lord John Russell had undertaken to form a\r\ngovernment. On June 25, on the very day on which their Corn Bill had\r\nbeen carried through the House of Lords, ministers had been defeated\r\nin the Commons by a Radical and Protectionist coalition. In the new\r\nadministration the seals of the Foreign Office passed into the keeping\r\nof Lord Palmerston.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n                      THE SPANISH MARRIAGES[831]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the close of the year 1845, when Peel had resigned office on\r\naccount of the dissensions in his Cabinet on the question of the\r\nCorn Laws, Lord John Russell had in vain attempted to form a\r\ngovernment. His failure had been due to the objections urged by Lord\r\nGrey to Palmerston's return to the Foreign Office.[832] Peel had,\r\nin consequence, agreed to withdraw his resignation and to carry on\r\nthe government. But it was soon clear that the Protectionists, if\r\nthey could not prevent the passage of his Corn Bill, would certainly\r\nencompass his downfall at the first opportunity. Palmerston, under\r\nthese circumstances, judged it advisable to take steps to remove the\r\nimpression that his nomination as Foreign Secretary would create alarm\r\nin France and imperil \"the cordial understanding.\" He, accordingly,\r\ndecided to visit Paris with the object of dispelling this idea. His\r\nintimate knowledge of the French language and his considerable powers\r\nof conversation, combined with the personal charm of Lady Palmerston,\r\nsoon achieved the desired result. In the previous month of December,\r\nthe prospect that \"_ce terrible Lord Palmerston_\" would be once again\r\nat the Foreign Office had spread dismay in ministerial circles.\r\nBut, in the following spring, when he returned to England, after a\r\nfew weeks' stay in Paris, the amiable qualities and the friendly\r\ndispositions of \"_ce cher Lord Palmerston_\" were the chief topic of\r\nconversation in the political _salons_.[833]\r\n\r\nLouis Philippe and his Foreign Minister had been most disagreeably\r\nsurprised by the disclosure of the proposal made by Christina to\r\nthe Duke of Saxe-Coburg. Lord Aberdeen's straightforward conduct\r\nin the affair could not undo the fact that the Queen-Mother had\r\ndeliberately, and without the knowledge of the French ambassador,\r\nopened a negotiation for the marriage of Isabella to a prince,\r\nwho was not a descendant of Philip V. In pursuance of this policy\r\nthe Duke of Sotomayor, the Spanish ambassador in London, had been\r\ninstructed to inquire officially in what light the British government\r\nwould regard the selection of a prince, who was not a Bourbon, as\r\nthe future husband of the Queen. To this question Lord Aberdeen had\r\nreplied that, \"should it be found that no descendant of Philip V.\r\ncould safely be chosen, consistently with the happiness of the Queen\r\nor with a due regard to the tranquillity of the country, it could be\r\nno cause of displeasure to Great Britain were a prince from some other\r\nfamily to be selected.\" He could not believe that in such a case \"the\r\nenlightened Court of the Tuileries\" would interfere. \"But, if contrary\r\nto all reason and probability, an attempt were made to control the\r\nwishes and feelings of the Queen and the clearly understood will of\r\nher people, Spain would not only receive the warmest sympathy of Great\r\nBritain but of all Europe.\"[834]\r\n\r\nM. Guizot appears to have been even more annoyed than Louis Philippe\r\nat Christina's proposal to the Coburgs. He is said, indeed, to\r\nhave attempted to persuade the King to counteract it, by demanding\r\nthe hand of Isabella for his son Montpensier. But neither Louis\r\nPhilippe nor the young Duke himself were prepared to resort to so\r\nextreme a measure. The King, for the present, was content to address\r\nacrimonious complaints to Christina,[835] and to instruct M. Bresson\r\nto make a strong representation to the Spanish ministers.[836] At the\r\nsame time, both he and M. Guizot decided to take steps to effect a\r\nreconciliation between the Queen-Mother and General Narvaez, whose\r\nreturn to power they regarded as essential to the success of their\r\nplans. Meanwhile, Jarnac spoke of Palmerston, with whom he had had his\r\nfirst interview on July 14, as \"fairly well intentioned and rather\r\ntimid.\" This description of his attitude, M. Guizot admitted, was\r\nmost satisfactory. \"Nevertheless, between him and me,\" he pointed out\r\nto his royal master, \"there can be nothing more than a marriage of\r\nreason.\" He purposed, therefore, so to arrange matters that he might\r\nbe enabled to communicate his views directly to Lord John Russell.\r\n\"It will require nice handling to speak to one about foreign affairs\r\nwithout offending the other. But, on occasions, we may have to do\r\nso.\"[837]\r\n\r\nBresson appears to have expressed himself strongly in favour of\r\nabandoning the Trapani marriage. In his opinion the matter resolved\r\nitself simply into choosing one of the sons of Don Francisco. Jarnac\r\nwas, accordingly, instructed to propose to Lord Palmerston that these\r\ntwo princes should be the objects of the joint support of France and\r\nEngland. \"London,\" wrote M. Guizot to Louis Philippe, \"will certainly\r\nfavour Don Enrique, on account of his intimate connection with the\r\n_Progressistas_. . . . Evidently Cadiz would be the best selection\r\nfor the Queen, Spain, and ourselves. Nevertheless, I do not think it\r\nadvisable to propose him directly.\"[838] Although Christina's overture\r\nto the Duke of Saxe-Coburg at Lisbon had been made early in June, no\r\nanswer had yet been returned to it. The prudent Coburgs would seem to\r\nhave regarded it as inexpedient to incur the lasting enmity of Louis\r\nPhilippe, for the sake of seeing a member of their family raised to\r\nthe position of King-Consort of Spain. Upon his arrival in England,\r\nat the end of June, the Duke was strongly advised in this sense both\r\nby King Leopold and by Prince Albert. He, accordingly, resolved to\r\nreject Christina's offer, on the ground of the injury which must\r\nresult to Spain from a marriage contracted in opposition to the wishes\r\nof France.[839] This decision, however, would not appear to have been\r\ncommunicated directly to Louis Philippe. Nevertheless, the private\r\nletters, during the months of July and August, both of Bresson and\r\nGuizot, show plainly that they were aware that the Coburgs had no\r\nintention of entertaining the Queen-Mother's proposal.[840]\r\n\r\nPalmerston, whilst in opposition, appears to have known nothing of\r\nthe details of the Spanish marriage question. Until informed of it\r\nby Aberdeen, with whom he had a long conversation in the first days\r\nof July, he was completely ignorant of Christina's proposal to the\r\nCoburgs.[841] From 1834 to 1841, however, he had constantly been\r\nengaged in combating the _Moderados_, and, upon his return to office\r\nin 1846, he at once reverted to his former policy of favouring the\r\n_Progressistas_. Under these circumstances, the candidature of Don\r\nEnrique, whose connection with the extreme wing of the Liberal party\r\nhad been the cause of his exile and disgrace, would naturally enlist\r\nhis approval and support. Nevertheless, in his first communication to\r\nMr. Bulwer, he expressed no preference for any particular candidate.\r\nSpanish affairs, he wrote in his famous despatch of July 19, appeared\r\nto be divided into two questions--the marriage of the Queen and the\r\ncondition of the country. In respect to the first, he had nothing\r\nto add to those instructions with which Bulwer had been supplied\r\nby his predecessor in office. There were three candidates in the\r\nfield--Prince Leopold of Coburg and the two sons of Don Francisco de\r\nPaula--and \"Her Majesty's government could only hope that the choice\r\nmight fall upon the one most likely to secure the happiness of the\r\nQueen and promote the welfare of the Spanish nation.\" The greater part\r\nof the despatch, however, was concerned with the second question--the\r\npolitical condition of the country. On that point, although Lord\r\nPalmerston had no particular instructions to give, he had some very\r\nsevere criticisms to offer. \"After a struggle of now thirty-four\r\nyears' duration for constitutional freedom, Spain,\" he declared,\r\n\"finds herself under a system of government almost as arbitrary in\r\npractice, whatever it may be in theory, as any which has existed in\r\nany former period of her history. She has indeed a Parliament, but\r\nall freedom for discussion has been overborne by force. . . . There\r\nis, indeed, by law liberty of the press, but that liberty has, by\r\nthe arbitrary acts of the government, been reduced to the liberty of\r\npublishing what may be agreeable to the executive. . . . This system\r\nof violence seems, in some degree, to have survived the fall of its\r\nauthor[842] and not to have been as yet entirely abandoned by the\r\nmore moderate men who have succeeded him in the government. . . . It\r\nwas certainly not for the purpose of subjecting the Spanish nation\r\nto a grinding tyranny that Great Britain entered into the Quadruple\r\nAlliance and gave that active assistance, which contributed so\r\nmaterially to the expulsion of Don Carlos from Spain. . . .\"[843]\r\n\r\nThis despatch was not to be communicated to the Spanish Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs, but was intended to enable Mr. Bulwer to express,\r\n\"to those persons who might have the power of remedying the existing\r\nevils,\" the opinions of his government upon the state of the country.\r\nBut, having sent it to Madrid, Palmerston, on July 20, confidentially\r\ninformed M. de Jarnac of its contents and allowed him to be supplied\r\nwith a copy of it. It is plain that he must have had some reason for\r\nthus communicating to the French _chargé d'affaires_ a despatch,\r\nreplete with sentiments which could not but be otherwise than very\r\ndistasteful to his government. Without doubt, he must have known\r\nthat Bulwer's instructions would be at once passed on from Paris to\r\nMadrid, and it can only, therefore, be supposed that he wished the\r\nSpanish ministers to learn in this manner exactly what he thought\r\nabout them. Perhaps, also, he was not sorry that M. Guizot should\r\nhave an opportunity of realizing the very low estimation in which he\r\nheld his political friends, the _Moderados_. To the marriage question\r\nhe obviously attached little importance, and his remarks upon that\r\nsubject were, doubtless, drawn up far less carefully than those which\r\nhad reference to the actual condition of Spain.\r\n\r\nLouis Philippe, at this time, was somewhat disturbed by a letter from\r\nM. Bresson to M. Guizot, dated July 12, in which the ambassador gave a\r\nlengthy account of his recent proceedings at Madrid. The Queen-Mother,\r\nhe reported, urged various objections to the Duke of Cadiz.\r\n\"Isabella,\" she declared, \"had an insurmountable aversion to him and\r\nshe herself had grave doubts about his virility. This last statement,\"\r\nwrote M. Bresson, \"took us upon very delicate ground. She adverted\r\nto his voice, his hips, and his general bodily conformation, and I\r\nreplied by insisting that his rigid morality was to be ascribed solely\r\nto his consuming passion for the Queen, her daughter. Furthermore, I\r\npointed out, that his desire to marry was inconsistent with the idea\r\nthat he was incapable of fulfilling the conditions of matrimony.\"\r\nChristina's opinion upon that point was probably little influenced by\r\narguments such as these. But, when M. Bresson took upon himself to\r\nassure her that, \"in any Bourbon combination\" the marriage of the Duc\r\nde Montpensier with the Infanta could be announced simultaneously with\r\nthat of the Queen, she received the information with \"every appearance\r\nof sincere pleasure.\" Rianzarez also expressed to him his satisfaction\r\nwith this arrangement, which would remove the great political\r\nobjection to the Queen's marriage with Cadiz or, even, with Trapani.\r\nBresson, however, was of opinion that her union with the former could\r\nbe effected more easily and expeditiously than with the latter, and\r\nhe, accordingly, suggested that his regiment should be brought to\r\nMadrid, in order that, \"by constantly seeing him, Isabella might grow\r\naccustomed to his voice and hips.\"[844]\r\n\r\nThe Queens, Louis Philippe declared at once, must be given to\r\nunderstand clearly that Bresson had no right to promise that the\r\ntwo marriages would be concluded simultaneously. He was not to be\r\nmoved from this decision by Guizot's insinuation that possibly the\r\nambassador had not gone quite so far as His Majesty imagined. On the\r\ncontrary, he replied, he had very little doubt that he had committed\r\nhimself even more deeply than he admitted. It was while he was in this\r\nmood that Jarnac's copy of Palmerston's despatch of July 19 reached\r\nParis. A perusal of its contents caused the King a considerable amount\r\nof annoyance,[845] yet it would not appear to have weakened his\r\ndetermination to insist upon the disavowal of M. Bresson.[846] But the\r\nquestion, as to how far the despatch of July 19 was responsible for\r\nthe final decision of Louis Philippe, will be discussed later on.\r\n\r\nAlthough in his official instructions he had expressed no preference\r\nfor any particular candidate, Palmerston soon informed Bulwer,\r\nprivately, that Don Enrique was the British candidate.[847] The\r\nselection of that prince called forth no objections from M. de\r\nJarnac. On the contrary, as late as August 16, he gave Palmerston\r\ndefinitely to understand that, provided he would adhere to that\r\narrangement, France would join with him in pressing it upon the\r\nCourt of Madrid.[848] Bulwer, however, was filled with dismay on\r\nlearning that he was expected to support the suit of Don Enrique.\r\nHe had little fault to find with him personally. He considered him\r\nmanly, enterprising and ambitious, and described him as resembling\r\nin many respects Prince Louis Napoleon.[849] There was one objection\r\nto him, however, and that was an insuperable one--nothing short of a\r\nsuccessful revolution would induce Christina to accept him. \"Let me\r\ncaution your Lordship again and again,\" he wrote on August 4, \"against\r\nappearing to listen to the counsels of the _Progressistas_ and Don\r\nEnrique, if you wish to retain the confidence of the palace.\"[850]\r\n\r\nNo sooner was Palmerston installed at the Foreign Office, than Bulwer,\r\nreverting to his former scheme, began to plead earnestly in favour\r\nof the Coburg marriage. France, he maintained, in order to carry out\r\nsuccessfully her plans of aggrandisement in Algeria, Morocco, Tunis\r\nand Egypt must exercise a paramount influence at Madrid. It followed,\r\ntherefore, that all her ambitious designs would be checkmated by the\r\nQueen's marriage outside the Bourbon line. \"The policy of maintaining\r\ngood relations with France,\" he was not disposed to dispute it, \"was\r\na great and wise policy. But what would happen,\" he asked, \"were\r\nLouis Philippe to die? In that event would not the power of a great\r\nmilitary nation fall into the hands of three or four enterprising\r\nyoung men, burning for glory in their several careers? The policy of\r\ngood relations with France depended,\" he much feared, \"upon the life\r\nof a man of seventy-four and upon the well or the ill-directed aim of\r\nan assassin.\"[851] The Coburg marriage, Christina assured him, could\r\nstill be arranged. Let the management of the affair be entrusted to\r\nhim and he would undertake to bring it to a successful conclusion.\r\nFrance would oppose it vigorously, and it must, therefore, be prepared\r\nin secrecy. Indeed, he acknowledged that his plan must needs \"wear\r\nthe aspect of an intrigue, in order to avoid the effects of an\r\nintrigue.\"[852]\r\n\r\nPalmerston, however, was not to be diverted from his intention by\r\nthese arguments. The Court, the government, and the Coburgs themselves\r\nwere alike agreed that Louis Philippe's hostility to it had rendered\r\nthe Spanish proposal unacceptable. On August 22, therefore, he\r\naddressed a lengthy despatch to Bulwer, in which he laid it down as\r\nthe deliberate opinion of the British government that Don Enrique was\r\nthe most suitable candidate.[853] But, before this communication could\r\nreach Madrid, the affair to which it referred had been definitely\r\nsettled. The French government had not failed to turn its knowledge\r\nof Palmerston's dispatch of July 19 to account. M. Bresson, in\r\npursuance of M. Guizot's[854] instructions, had been busily engaged in\r\nrepresenting it as a declaration of hostility against the _Moderado_\r\ngovernment in Madrid. Nuñoz, the brother of the Duke of Rianzarez,\r\ninformed Mr. Bulwer that all hope of arranging the Coburg marriage\r\nhad been abandoned, that Palmerston \"would listen to no other\r\nalliance but that of Don Enrique, who is looked upon by the Court as\r\nan open adversary and a disguised rebel,\" and that a _Progressista_\r\ninsurrection was being prepared in London.[855] Only a week after\r\nhe had transmitted this news, the British minister, on August 29,\r\nreported that the Queen, the night before at 12 o'clock, had made\r\nup her mind in favour of Don Francisco de Asis, Duke of Cadiz.\r\nFurthermore, he had to inform Lord Palmerston that the marriage of\r\nthe Duc de Montpensier would take place at the same time. \"I learn,\"\r\nhe wrote in conclusion, \"that directly the Queen had signified her\r\nintention of marrying her cousin, Count Bresson formally asked the\r\nhand of the Infanta for the Duke of Montpensier, stating that he had\r\npowers to enter upon and conclude that affair.\"[856]\r\n\r\nM. Guizot, on September 1, communicated this news to Lord Normanby,\r\nthe new British ambassador in Paris.[857] Palmerston, who was\r\nyachting with Her Majesty on the south coast of England, received\r\nthe information of the conclusion of the double marriage in a letter\r\nfrom the Comte de Jarnac. Louis Philippe eluded the disagreeable\r\ntask of apprising Queen Victoria that he had broken his compact, by\r\nallowing his own Queen, Marie Amélie, to convey the intelligence\r\nto her. The reply which she received was short and cold. \"You will\r\nremember,\" wrote Queen Victoria, \"what passed between the King and\r\nmyself at Eu. . . . You will, doubtless, have heard that, in order\r\nto be agreeable to your King, we declined to arrange the marriage\r\nof our cousin, Prince Leopold, with the Queen of Spain. . . . You\r\nwill, therefore, easily understand that the sudden announcement of\r\nthis double marriage could only cause us surprise and the keenest\r\nregret. . .\"[858]\r\n\r\nM. Guizot explained his conduct by referring to the _Memorandum of\r\nFebruary 27, 1846_, of the existence of which Palmerston was now for\r\nthe first time informed. In that document France had reserved to\r\nherself the right of departing from the agreement at Eu, should at any\r\ntime a Coburg marriage appear \"imminent or probable.\" Palmerston's\r\ninclusion of Prince Leopold among the available candidates in his\r\ndespatch of July 19, combined with Christina's overture at Lisbon,\r\nin the previous month of May, had created a situation, M. Guizot\r\ninsisted, which released France from all her engagements. But,\r\nalthough he firmly maintained this contention and instructed M. de\r\nJarnac to hold the same language in London, his conduct was not that\r\nof a man confident in the justice of his cause. Besides attempting\r\nto induce Lord Aberdeen to declare that, under the circumstances, a\r\ndeparture from the compact at Eu was permissible, he drew up a bitter\r\nattack upon Lord Palmerston and sent it to Jarnac with instructions\r\nto forward it to Lord John Russell. But in both cases he met with\r\ndisappointment. Aberdeen told him frankly that he could not adopt his\r\nview of the case, and that he had no fault to find with the language\r\nor the conduct of his successor in office.[859] John Russell showed\r\nhis letter to Palmerston, and informed M. de Jarnac that his colleague\r\nhad his hearty approval and support.[860] Louis Philippe, meanwhile,\r\nhad compiled a lengthy statement of his case and had sent it to\r\nhis daughter, the Queen of the Belgians, in order that it might be\r\nplaced before Queen Victoria. But neither his laboured attempts to\r\nextenuate his own conduct nor his insinuations about Lord Palmerston\r\nproduced the desired effect. After a careful consideration of his\r\nletter, replied the Queen on September 27, she had failed to discover\r\nany reasons which could justify him in breaking his promise. She had\r\narrived at this conclusion, she begged him to believe, \"by the help\r\nof her own eyes,\" not, as he had suggested, by the aid of those of\r\nLord Palmerston.[861]\r\n\r\nThe protests of the Queen, however, were as ineffectual as the\r\nofficial remonstrances of Bulwer at Madrid and of Normanby in Paris.\r\nOn October 10, 1846, the double marriage was duly solemnized at the\r\npalace, in the hall called \"_de Embajadores_.\" The British minister\r\nwas not present at the ceremony, which was witnessed by a great crowd\r\nof persons. \"One _viva_ only was heard, and that not very loud,\r\nwhen the Infante Don Francisco descended from his carriage.\"[862]\r\nLouis Philippe and M. Guizot had attained their object, but they had\r\nsacrificed \"the cordial understanding.\" In England, the authors of\r\nthe Spanish marriages stood condemned by the Court, by the Cabinet,\r\nand by public opinion. There was no thought of an appeal to arms, but\r\nit was felt that in the future the relations of the two governments\r\ncould no longer be carried on in the same spirit of close and friendly\r\nintimacy. Palmerston, founding his case upon the renunciation made at\r\nthe Peace of Utrecht[863] by the Duc d'Orléans of that day, sought to\r\ninduce the Powers to declare that any children, which might be born\r\nto the Duc de Montpensier and the Infanta, would be excluded from\r\nsucceeding to the Spanish throne. Throughout Europe, however, there\r\nwere ominous signs of a recrudescence of the revolutionary spirit,\r\nand Metternich, in consequence, had strong reasons for desiring to\r\npropitiate Louis Philippe and M. Guizot. He, therefore, refused to\r\npronounce himself and simply adopted an attitude of neutrality, taking\r\ncare to point out that the trouble could never have arisen, had the\r\nlegitimist principle been upheld and had Don Carlos been enthroned.\r\nRussia and Prussia, which like Austria had never acknowledged the\r\nsovereignty of Isabella, followed the example of the Court of Vienna\r\nand declined to be drawn into the controversy.\r\n\r\nPalmerston's conduct was, unquestionably, ill-advised in thus\r\nattempting to apply to Spain, in the middle of the nineteenth century,\r\nthe stipulations of diplomatic instruments framed when the conditions\r\nof Europe were very different. But, if his objections to the Infanta's\r\nmarriage, founded upon the Treaty of Utrecht, were unsuccessful, he\r\nwas afforded the satisfaction of completely refuting the pleas set up\r\nby M. Guizot in justification of his actions. The argument which forms\r\nthe main contention of his despatches, both of October 31, 1846 and\r\nof January 8, 1847, is unanswerable. The _Memorandum of February 27,\r\n1846_, to which the French government attached so much importance was,\r\nhe pointed out, unofficial and verbal. No record of it was to be found\r\nat the Foreign Office. M. de Jarnac had never mentioned it to him,\r\n\"until after the event had happened for which it was now quoted as a\r\njustification.\" But, \"even admitting for the sake of argument that Her\r\nMajesty's present government were to be held bound by it, how could it\r\njustify a departure from the engagement of Eu? The imminent danger,\r\nspecified in that _memorandum_, was the likelihood that either the\r\nQueen or the Infanta should be about immediately to marry a foreign\r\nPrince, not being a descendant of Philip V. But if that likelihood had\r\never existed, it had at all events ceased to exist, when M. Bresson\r\ndemanded the hand of the Infanta for the Duc de Montpensier. Not only\r\nhad it then ceased to exist, but with respect to the Queen, whose\r\nmarriage was then the immediate and only subject of discussion, it\r\nhad been succeeded by an impossibility; because when Count Bresson\r\ndemanded the hand of the Infanta the marriage of the Queen to the\r\nInfant Don Francisco had actually been resolved upon and settled.\"[864]\r\n\r\nBoth in the French Chambers and in the British Parliament the Spanish\r\nmarriages were the subject of debate, at the opening of the session of\r\n1847. The publication of the English _blue-book_ created a profound\r\nsensation in France.[865] After reading the correspondence, no one\r\ncould any longer maintain that England had encouraged the candidature\r\nof Prince Leopold of Coburg, or that Louis Philippe had been justified\r\nin breaking the agreement of Eu. Nevertheless, in spite of the light\r\nwhich was thus thrown upon the proceedings which led up to the\r\nmarriages, the true history of the case was only imperfectly revealed.\r\nEven to-day, the real motives which actuated some of the principal\r\nactors in the affair are still largely a matter of conjecture.\r\nPalmerston[866] himself believed, and his opinion has been adopted by\r\nthe majority of English writers, that a secret understanding existed\r\nbetween Christina and Louis Philippe. The Queen-Mother's overture to\r\nthe Duke of Saxe-Coburg has been represented as a trap craftily laid\r\nfor the British government. England, it was calculated, would never\r\nresist the temptation of actively supporting the candidature of Prince\r\nLeopold, and Louis Philippe would, in consequence, be furnished with\r\na pretext for repudiating his promises.[867] But, plausible as this\r\nexplanation of Christina's conduct may sound, it cannot stand the test\r\nof a close examination.\r\n\r\nHad the Queen-Mother never manifested any anxiety to marry her\r\ndaughter to a Coburg, until she requested Bulwer to transmit her\r\nproposal to Lisbon, her proceedings, it must be admitted, would be\r\nopen to grave suspicion. But the facts of the case are very different.\r\nOn at least three previous occasions, when she cannot possibly have\r\nbeen acting in collusion with Louis Philippe, she had declared her\r\npredilection for the Coburg match. In 1838, during the civil war,\r\nshe mentioned the matter to Lord Clarendon.[868] In 1841, after her\r\nabdication, when she was living in Paris, she sent Count Toreno to\r\nLord Cowley to inform him that she regarded a Coburg Prince as the\r\nmost suitable husband for Isabella.[869] No sooner was she back at\r\nMadrid, in 1844, than she expressed herself in the same spirit to Mr.\r\nBulwer.[870] To the very last she appears to have struggled against\r\nthe dictation of the King of the French. Finding that the Coburgs were\r\nfearful of incurring the wrath of the Court of the Tuileries, she did\r\nall in her power to persuade Louis Philippe not to insist upon her\r\ndaughter's marriage with a Bourbon, \"who had none of the qualities\r\ncalculated to make her happy.\" As late as the middle of July, 1846,\r\nshe sent the Marquis of Miraflores to Paris to plead her cause with\r\nhim. But the \"Citizen King\" was inflexible. \"Royal marriages,\" he\r\nreminded her, \"were not like of those of private individuals.\"[871]\r\nNevertheless, she still refused to yield, and when she at last gave\r\nway and compelled the unfortunate Isabella to marry the Duke of Cadiz,\r\nit was the ill-judged intervention of Lord Palmerston which was the\r\ncause of her surrender, not the expostulations and threats of Louis\r\nPhilippe.\r\n\r\nIn Spain, in 1846, the victory of one party over another meant\r\nsomething more than that a particular set of politicians had been\r\ntemporarily replaced in office by their opponents. Disgrace, exile\r\nand even loss of liberty were the fate which generally awaited the\r\nleaders of a defeated party. Christina herself, after the triumph\r\nof the _Progressistas_ in 1836, had had to submit to the insolent\r\ndictation of a band of mutinous sergeants and had seen her _Moderado_\r\nministers forced to fly from the country. Four years later the same\r\nparty, in its hour of victory, had humiliated her as a woman and as\r\na Queen and had driven her to resign the regency. She was not by\r\nnature vindictive, but she, doubtless, regarded a _Progressista_\r\nwith feelings very similar to those which her father or her brother\r\nentertained for a _Carbonaro_. It may be imagined, therefore, with\r\nwhat dismay she read Palmerston's despatch of July 19. In every\r\nline of it the intention of befriending her enemies was apparent.\r\nPalmerston, it was clear to her, was declaring that Don Enrique was\r\nthe only suitable husband for Isabella, simply in order to promote the\r\nfortunes of the _Progressistas_.\r\n\r\nOnce convinced that the _Moderado régime_ was endangered by the\r\nhostility of Lord Palmerston, Christina determined to comply with\r\nLouis Philippe's demands and thus obtain his protection. The Duke\r\nof Cadiz was hastily summoned to Madrid and Isabella was compelled\r\nto accept him for a husband. It is not absolutely certain whether\r\nthe Queen-Mother insisted upon the simultaneous announcement of\r\nMontpensier's marriage with her second daughter, or whether the\r\nproposal came from M. Bresson. It is highly probable, however, that\r\nshe made it an indispensable condition to her acceptation of Cadiz.\r\nThe fact that the Infanta was betrothed to a son of Louis Philippe\r\nwould conciliate the French party and would be looked upon by people,\r\ngenerally, as some compensation for the extreme insignificance of the\r\nKing Consort. Moreover, from her point of view there was another, and\r\na far stronger reason, in favour of the simultaneous conclusion of the\r\ntwo marriages. Once the elder brother was the husband of the Queen, it\r\nwould be very difficult to prevent the marriage of the younger, Don\r\nEnrique, with the Infanta.[872] That danger could be averted only by\r\nthe announcement that she was betrothed to, and was shortly to marry,\r\nMontpensier.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that he owed his crown to a popular revolution, Louis\r\nPhilippe attached the highest importance to the natural alliances of\r\nthe Bourbons. The maintenance of relations with Spain on the footing\r\nof consanguinity was, in consequence, the constant aim of his policy.\r\nIn the pursuit of this object he found a ready instrument in his\r\nForeign Minister. By upholding the principle that Isabella's husband\r\nmust be a descendant of Philip V., M. Guizot purposed to disprove\r\nthe reproach of his opponents that this foreign policy was weak and\r\nsubservient to England.[873] His motives are perfectly comprehensible.\r\nBut the reasons which induced the King to break the compact of Eu,\r\nby consenting to allow his son's marriage to take place at the same\r\ntime as that of the Queen, have never been satisfactorily explained.\r\nLouis Philippe was very angry upon learning, on July 20, 1846, that\r\nM. Bresson, in order to overcome Christina's repugnance to the Duke\r\nof Cadiz, had held out to her the inducement that Montpensier's\r\nmarriage with the Infanta might be concluded simultaneously. Turning\r\na deaf ear to the timid remonstrances of M. Guizot, he insisted upon\r\nthe necessity of acquainting the Queen-Mother that his ambassador\r\nhad greatly exceeded his instructions. His private correspondence,\r\ndiscovered at the Tuileries after the Revolution of '48, makes his\r\nsentiments upon that point absolutely clear.[874] Nevertheless, in\r\nthe course of the next three weeks all his scruples vanished, and he\r\nallowed M. Bresson to be furnished with the powers necessary for the\r\nconclusion of the double marriage.\r\n\r\nAccording to the official French version of the affair, it was\r\nthe despatch of July 19 which caused the King to change his mind.\r\nSeeing that Palmerston had placed Coburg at the head of the list\r\nof candidates, he, rightly or wrongly, conceived that the danger,\r\nspecified in the _Memorandum of February 27, 1846_, had become\r\n\"probable and imminent,\" and that he was, in consequence, released\r\nfrom all his engagements to England. But his secret correspondence\r\nwith M. Guizot completely disproves this assertion. In forwarding, on\r\nJuly 24, the despatch to the King, Guizot himself made no suggestion\r\nof that nature. On the contrary, he expressed the extremely judicious\r\nopinion that Palmerston was very indifferent about Coburg and was\r\nrather trying to regain his influence over the _Progressistas_. Louis\r\nPhilippe took the same view of the case. He was greatly annoyed at\r\nthe strictures passed upon his friends, the _Moderados_, predicted\r\nthat Palmerston's proceedings would lead to the _bouleversement_ of\r\nSpain, but \"all that,\" he wrote, \"makes it the more necessary that our\r\ndisavowal of the simultaneous marriage plan should reach Christina\r\nat once. The more we suspect bad faith in others the more must we be\r\ncareful to keep our own hands clean.\"[875] The letters published in\r\nthe _Revue retrospective_ show that he adhered to these admirable\r\nsentiments for some ten days longer. There is no document, however,\r\nor trustworthy evidence to explain why, probably about August 13 or\r\n14, he suddenly decided to adopt a totally different view of the\r\nmatter. Under these circumstances it is only possible to suggest the\r\nfollowing explanation.\r\n\r\nLouis Philippe in the question of the Spanish marriages had a twofold\r\nobject in view. To his Bourbon policy was subjoined the _bourgeois_\r\npolicy of the _père de famille_, who was desirous of obtaining for\r\nhis son the large fortune which was supposed to be the portion\r\nof the Infanta. Palmerston, however, was determined to prevent\r\nthe accomplishment of this plan. To the well-known instructions\r\ntransmitted to Bulwer, on August 22, was appended a despatch, marked\r\n_separate and confidential_, in which he laid down the principle that\r\nMontpensier's marriage with the Infanta \"would be as objectionable,\r\nand in some respects more so, than his marriage with the Queen.\"[876]\r\nIt is true that the contents of this despatch were unknown to Louis\r\nPhilippe and his agents, and moreover, that before it reached Bulwer's\r\nhands the affair had been concluded. But Guizot was, undoubtedly,\r\naware of Palmerston's opinions on the subject. Indeed, in a letter to\r\nthe King, on August 8, he expressed the fear that, although Coburg\r\nmight be abandoned so far as Isabella was concerned, Palmerston\r\nwould probably attempt to marry him to the Infanta. \"After our first\r\nbattle,\" he wrote, \"we shall have to fight another, and a very sharp\r\none.\"[877] Louis Philippe himself, a few days later, appears to\r\nhave been disturbed by a letter which his Queen had received from\r\nChristina. The tone of it he considered unpleasant, \"and it contained\r\nno mention of Montpensier's marriage.\" . . . \"Our situation,\"\r\nhe informed Guizot, \"has, in consequence, much changed for the\r\nworse.\"[878]\r\n\r\nIt is evident, therefore, that on August 12, Louis Philippe was\r\naware that danger threatened his project of marrying his son to the\r\nInfanta from two quarters. Palmerston was resolved to oppose it, and\r\nthe Queen-Mother, if not actually hostile to it, was showing some\r\nreluctance to support it. But in the course of the next day or two,\r\nnews would probably be received from Madrid of the effect which the\r\ndespatch of July 19 had had upon Christina and her ministers. Under\r\nthese circumstances, a great effort was, doubtless, made to persuade\r\nthe King to give Bresson a free hand. Guizot, Madame Adelaïde,[879]\r\nand other members of his family assuredly represented to him that\r\nthe present opportunity must not be allowed to escape. Christina was\r\nthoroughly frightened, and would be prepared to accept both Cadiz and\r\nMontpensier, provided only that the two marriages could take place\r\nsimultaneously. Should there be either hesitation or delay, however,\r\nPalmerston would have time to mature his plans, and the Infanta and\r\nher fortune would be lost to them.\r\n\r\nIf the theory, here put forward, be correct, that it was Palmerston's\r\nhostility to Montpensier's projected marriage which caused Louis\r\nPhilippe to break his promise to England, the question arises,\r\nwhether, under the circumstances, he was not justified in regarding\r\nhimself as released from his engagements. M. Thureau-Dangin[880]\r\ncontends that the King, having undertaken at Eu to postpone his son's\r\nmarriage with the Infanta until the Queen should have children,\r\nhad a right to expect that, in the interval, England should do\r\nnothing to facilitate her marriage with any other prince. Aberdeen,\r\nunquestionably, did not regard the matter in that light. He simply\r\nlooked upon Montpensier's marriage with the Infanta as delayed for\r\nseveral years, until, by the birth of heirs to Isabella, it should\r\nhave lost its political significance. Even then, when it should be\r\nless objectionable, he did not consider that England was bound to\r\nconsent to it, and, in the meantime, as he pointed out to Peel,\r\n\"many things might happen.\"[881] Palmerston most certainly would\r\nhave repudiated the notion that the compact of Eu debarred him from\r\nrecommending the alliance of the Infanta with Leopold of Coburg. \"We\r\ncan admit of no parity of position,\" he told Jarnac, \"between a son\r\nof the King of the French and the third son of a German nobleman as\r\nclosely related to the French, as to the British, Royal Family.\"[882]\r\nM. Guizot, in the _Memorandum of February 27_, undoubtedly declared\r\nthat the Bourbon principle applied equally to the Queen and the\r\nInfanta, but he clearly had not much faith in his ability to make good\r\nthat contention. He was perfectly aware of Palmerston's sentiments\r\nwith respect to Montpensier's marriage, but he never attempted to\r\nargue that, because of them, the King was released from his promise.\r\nThroughout the controversy he confined himself to asserting, what\r\nhe knew to be untrue, that Palmerston's proceedings had rendered\r\n\"probable and imminent\" the alliance of a Coburg prince with Queen\r\nIsabella.\r\n\r\nIn most English accounts it is taken for granted that Louis Philippe\r\nselected the Duke of Cadiz as a husband for Isabella, in order to\r\nmake certain that the succession to the Spanish throne should pass\r\nto the descendants of Montpensier. But the circumstances do not\r\nwarrant this assumption. Count Trapani, whose physical fitness was\r\nnever called into question, was always his favourite candidate. It\r\nwas only in the last resort, when, owing to the unpopularity of the\r\nNeapolitan connection, he was forced to bring forward another Bourbon,\r\nthat he fell back upon Cadiz. The suspicions which existed about the\r\nvirility of this young prince did not deter the King from seeking to\r\nimpose him upon Isabella. He cannot, however, be fairly charged with\r\nhaving expressly chosen him, because he believed him to be impotent.\r\nDon Enrique and the sons of Don Carlos being for different political\r\nreasons out of the question, he had no option but to renounce his\r\nBourbon principle, or to insist upon the Queen's marriage with the\r\nDuke of Cadiz.\r\n\r\nThe experience of England during the eighteenth century had taught\r\nher to look with dread upon the prospect of having to struggle\r\nsingle-handed against the two Bourbon Powers. The lesson of 1783 was\r\nnever forgotten by her statesmen. Under the Restoration, when the\r\nabsolute rule of Ferdinand VII. was re-established by French bayonets,\r\nMr. Canning, to avert the dangers of a close alliance between the\r\nCourts of Madrid and of the Tuileries, acknowledged the revolted\r\nSpanish colonies and \"called in the new world to redress the balance\r\nof the old.\" Palmerston was confronted by a different situation. Spain\r\nwas weaker, but France had acquired Algiers and was upon terms of\r\nsuspicious friendliness with Mehemet Ali. In alliance with the Pasha\r\nof Egypt in the east and with Spain in the west, she might, it was to\r\nbe feared, obtain a complete control of the Mediterranean. It was,\r\ntherefore, Palmerston conceived, a matter of the first importance that\r\nher influence over the Cabinet of Madrid should be destroyed. This\r\nobject, in his opinion, could never be successfully attained until\r\nSpain should be endowed with Liberal institutions, and should adopt a\r\nnational, not a dynastic, policy. It was with this end in view that he\r\nentered into the Quadruple Treaty, by which England engaged to assist\r\nthe _Christinos_ to expel Don Carlos from the Peninsula. Without\r\ndoubt, the idea upon which his policy was based was statesmanlike;\r\nnevertheless, the methods by which he hoped to accomplish his purpose\r\nwere deplorably unsound. The treaty of 1834 involved interference in\r\nthe domestic affairs of Spain, and that in combination with the very\r\nPower the ascendancy of which over the Spanish government it was his\r\nsecret object to diminish.\r\n\r\nAny military advantages which the _Christinos_ may have derived from\r\nthe Quadruple Treaty were more than counterbalanced by the harm, which\r\nthe jealous interference of France and Great Britain in her internal\r\naffairs, inflicted upon Spain. Long after the Pretender had fled and\r\noutward peace had been restored, the political settlement of the\r\ncountry was retarded by the rivalry and intrigues of the ambassadors\r\nand ministers of the two Powers. The marriages of 1846, and all the\r\nevils which they brought in their train, were an outcome of the policy\r\nwhich Palmerston had inaugurated twelve years before. But he had not\r\nbeen in power during the whole of this period, and, when he returned\r\nto the Foreign Office, the marriage question was already far advanced.\r\nAberdeen was not responsible for the Quadruple Treaty, and he was\r\nsincerely desirous of putting an end to the practice of meddling with\r\ninternal politics, which both the French and British agents at Madrid\r\nhad adopted. Nevertheless, his weakness and irresolution in dealing\r\nwith M. Guizot were the cause of much mischief. Had he adhered to\r\nhis first pronouncement that England would object to any alliance\r\nwhich threatened to disturb the balance of power, but that, with that\r\nexception, she looked upon the Royal marriages as an exclusively\r\nSpanish affair, none of the subsequent complications could have\r\narisen. Unfortunately, however, after the downfall of Espartero, he\r\nundertook to observe a kind of benevolent neutrality towards the\r\nprinciple of the French government--that Isabella's husband must\r\nbe a Bourbon. The compact of Eu and the different interpretations\r\nwhich were placed upon it, the pretensions set up in the _Memorandum\r\nof February 27_, 1846, were the consequences of the modifications\r\nintroduced into his original declaration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n                PALMERSTON AND THE REVOLUTION OF '48.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhilst France and England had been quarrelling over the Spanish\r\nmarriages, events of greater importance had been taking place in\r\nCentral Europe. The Polish nationalists had planned an insurrection\r\nwhich was to break out simultaneously in Prussian and Austrian Poland.\r\nAt Posen, the authorities obtained early intelligence of the projected\r\nrising, and were enabled to suppress it without difficulty. But in\r\nGallicia, in February, 1846, the Austrian military commander was\r\nsuddenly called upon to deal with a formidable rebellion. Colonel\r\nBenedek,[883] however, by allowing the Polish peasants to wreak their\r\nhatred upon their landlords, succeeded in dividing the forces opposed\r\nto him and in subduing one revolution by another. The free town of\r\nCracow was the scene of severe fighting, and, after the defeat of the\r\ninsurgents, was occupied by Russian troops. The measure was to be\r\nmerely temporary, and the town, it was announced, would be evacuated,\r\ndirectly order should be restored. But, when it was evident that the\r\nSpanish marriage question had hopelessly divided France and England,\r\nthe Northern Courts adopted a different attitude. On November 15,\r\n1846, the Austrian, the Prussian and the Russian ministers in London\r\ninformed Palmerston that the independent existence of Cracow was\r\nincompatible with the public tranquillity of Europe, and that, in\r\nconsequence, it had been decided that the Republic should, in the\r\nfuture, form part of the Austrian Empire.[884] A similar communication\r\nwas, at the same time, made to the French government. The Republic of\r\nCracow having been constituted by a treaty between Austria, Russia,\r\nand Prussia, on May 3, 1815, these three Powers maintained that\r\nthey had a right to undo what they had done, without consultation\r\nwith the other Powers which were parties to the general settlement\r\nof 1815.[885] Both France and England at once entered a formal\r\nprotest. M. Guizot, having attained his object in Spain, was now bent\r\nupon re-establishing \"the cordial understanding,\" and would gladly\r\nhave made a joint representation to the three Powers with great\r\nBritain.[886] But his hope that the annexation of Cracow would prove\r\nthe means of reuniting France and England was not realized. Palmerston\r\ncontented himself with directing Normanby to furnish the French\r\ngovernment with a copy of the remonstrance which he addressed to the\r\nCourt of Vienna.[887]\r\n\r\nMetternich was not disturbed by these representations. It was out of\r\nthe power of England to enforce her views, and Louis Philippe and M.\r\nGuizot were careful at once to reassure him about their veritable\r\nintentions. Public indignation had been aroused in France by the\r\nextinction of the little republic and, under the circumstances, it\r\nhad been necessary to protest officially. But let the Chancellor\r\nunderstand, Louis Philippe informed the Austrian ambassador, that\r\nthe remonstrance which M. de Flahaut had been instructed to make at\r\nVienna was \"merely talk which could hurt no one.\"[888] Metternich,\r\nhowever, although he was thus speedily relieved from all anxiety as\r\nto the attitude which the western Powers purposed to adopt towards\r\nhis proceedings in Gallicia, had much cause for uneasiness in other\r\ndirections. Germany was seething with discontent, and the King of\r\nPrussia, by deciding to summon the combined Estates, was evincing\r\na regrettable disposition to acquiesce in the popular demand for a\r\ngreater measure of political rights. In Italy affairs presented a yet\r\nmore alarming appearance. For the past fourteen years the Peninsula\r\nhad been outwardly at peace. But Metternich's vigilance had not been\r\nlulled to sleep by this seeming acquiescence in existing conditions.\r\nA movement, he was well aware, was in progress infinitely more\r\ndangerous than the local insurrections planned in the secrecy of the\r\n_Carbonari_ lodges. Mazzini, by means of his society of _Young Italy_,\r\nand Gioberti, d'Azeglio and Balbo, by their writings, were teaching\r\nthe people to dream of independence and of national unity. Hitherto\r\nMetternich, in his policy of repression, had always been able to count\r\nupon the whole-hearted support of the different Italian governments.\r\nBut now the Sovereign of the most important State in the Peninsula\r\nwas strongly suspected of encouraging the propagation of these new\r\ndoctrines.\r\n\r\nCharles Albert, King of Sardinia, had, as the Prince of Carignano,\r\ndisplayed Liberal tendencies. In the Piedmontese rebellion of 1821\r\nhis conduct had been equivocal, but, since his accession, in 1831, he\r\nhad shown a firm determination to uphold the absolutist traditions\r\nof his House. Nevertheless, he now permitted both d'Azeglio and\r\nBalbo to reside unmolested within his dominions and, in spite of\r\nMetternich's remonstrances, his police scarcely interfered with the\r\nfree circulation of their subversive writings. In the summer of 1846,\r\nit was already apparent that the relations between the Courts of Turin\r\nand of Vienna were no longer upon their former friendly footing.\r\nOstensibly a question of tariff was the only cause of dispute. In\r\nreality, however, it was Charles Albert's increasing sympathy with\r\nthe Italian national movement which was the reason of the prohibitive\r\nduty, placed by Metternich, upon the wines of Piedmont.[889] Matters\r\nwere in this state when, on June 1, 1846, the Pope, Gregory XVI.,\r\ndied. Fifteen days later, Cardinal Mastai-Ferretti, Archbishop of\r\nImola, was elected to succeed him, and assumed the title of Pius IX.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the Papal States was deplorable. The finances were\r\nin disorder, and the government depended for its existence upon the\r\nprotection of Austria and upon the presence of its Swiss auxiliary\r\ntroops. The new Pope, it was hoped, would consent to the introduction\r\nof certain necessary measures of reform. The expectation that Pius\r\nIX. would not pursue the reactionary policy of his predecessor proved\r\nwell founded.[890] On July 16, 1846, a month after his election,\r\nHis Holiness proclaimed a general amnesty for political offences.\r\nThe educated classes had eagerly absorbed the doctrines of Balbo,\r\nd'Azeglio, and Gioberti, and the Liberal tendencies manifested by\r\nthe new Pope aroused an immense enthusiasm. Nor was his popularity\r\nconfined to his own dominions. The quiet and unpretending priest\r\nsuddenly found himself magnified into a national hero. Patriots, who\r\nhad begun to look to Charles Albert as the future liberator of Italy,\r\nnow placed all their hopes in Pius IX. It was not possible for him\r\nto withstand the enthusiasm which his concessions had called forth.\r\nIn the spring of 1847, a modified liberty was granted to the press,\r\nand the formation of a Council of State, to be chosen by the Pope\r\nfrom elected provincial delegates, was decreed. Lastly, on July 5,\r\nthe establishment of a civic guard was announced. The Grand Duke of\r\nTuscany, fearful that invidious comparisons would be drawn between\r\nhis methods of government and those of His Holiness, made haste to\r\ninitiate similar reforms at Florence.[891]\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of Louis Philippe, the death of Gregory XVI. amounted\r\nto a public misfortune. A Liberal Pope could not but add materially\r\nto the political unrest which had suddenly affected the whole of\r\nEurope.[892] Nevertheless, neither he nor M. Guizot were as yet\r\nprepared to join with Austria in counselling the Papal government\r\nto resist the popular demand for reforms. France was at the time\r\nrepresented at Rome by a man of considerable ability and learning,\r\nCount Rossi, an Italian political exile and a naturalized Frenchman.\r\nIn the first instance he was instructed to counsel the adoption of\r\na strictly _juste milieu_ policy.[893] The new Papal government\r\nshould be based upon the principles of an enlightened conservatism.\r\nHis Holiness would be well advised promptly to introduce certain\r\nmuch-needed reforms into his system of administration. Let him\r\nbeware, however, of listening to those who would propose violent and\r\nill-considered changes. Above all, let him avoid giving unnecessary\r\noffence to Austria.[894] But, after his quarrel with England over the\r\nSpanish marriages, M. Guizot decided to revise his Italian policy.\r\n\r\nIn every part of the world France and England were opposed to each\r\nother. M. Guizot's own relations with Lord Normanby were very far\r\nfrom friendly. The public denial of the French minister that he had\r\nused certain words, imputed to him by the British ambassador, had\r\nbeen followed by a personal quarrel, which had only been arranged by\r\nthe intervention of Count Apponyi, the Austrian ambassador.[895] At\r\nMadrid, the consequences of the distasteful marriage forced upon the\r\nyoung Queen were already apparent. Isabella was practically separated\r\nfrom her husband, and her relations with General Serrano were a cause\r\nof scandal. French and British rivalry was actively maintained by\r\nBresson and by Bulwer, who, with the full knowledge of Palmerston, was\r\ndeeply involved in all the intrigues of the palace.[896] At Athens,\r\nwhere King Otho had been compelled to grant a constitution, Lyons and\r\nPiscatory, the British and French ministers, were closely identified\r\nwith different political parties. In South America, a dispute between\r\nLord Howden and Comte Walewski threatened to put an end to the\r\nmediation of France and England in the war, which for some time past\r\nhad been in progress between Buenos Ayres and Monte Video.[897]\r\n\r\nM. Guizot, under these circumstances, resolved to make approaches\r\nto Austria. The British government alone was disposed to sympathize\r\nsincerely with the Liberal movement which was causing so much anxiety\r\nto the absolute Courts. If only he could arrive at an agreement with\r\nMetternich as to the policy to be adopted towards German, Swiss\r\nand Italian affairs, England would be isolated completely. But the\r\nnegotiation of such an understanding was a delicate matter. An\r\nalliance between the government of the \"Citizen King\" and the Cabinet\r\nof Vienna, for the maintenance of despotism and of the settlement of\r\n1815, was an unnatural combination which might prove fatal to its\r\npromotor. Public opinion in France was on the side of the peoples\r\nstruggling for political freedom. M. Thiers, the leader of the\r\nOpposition, had loudly declared that this was only the principle upon\r\nwhich French policy could be based. M. Guizot, therefore, considered\r\nit advisable, in his intercourse with Metternich, not to make use\r\nof the ordinary channels of communication, but to employ a secret\r\nagent. In the spring of 1847, accordingly, he sent to Vienna, a\r\ncertain Klindworth,[898] who on several former occasions appears to\r\nhave been entrusted with confidential missions by the French Foreign\r\nOffice. He was to assure Prince Metternich that the French government\r\nwas determined to uphold the territorial _status quo_, and was\r\nprepared to co-operate with Austria in opposing the introduction of\r\nany fundamental changes in the system of government of the different\r\nItalian States.[899]\r\n\r\nM. Guizot, furthermore, entered into a direct correspondence with\r\nPrince Metternich. But no precise agreement as to their respective\r\npolicies was concluded.[900] Guizot appears to have been mainly\r\nconcerned to assure the Austrian Chancellor of the high esteem which\r\nhe entertained for his perspicacity and judgment. Nor did he, on\r\noccasions, disdain to employ language which can only be described as\r\nthat of fulsome adulation.[901] Metternich could not be otherwise\r\nthan pleased and flattered by the advances thus made to him. He was\r\nnot, however, disposed to set an undue value upon the protestations of\r\nM. Guizot. He had little doubt that, were Austria to invade the Papal\r\nStates, France would at once dispatch an army to Italy, proclaiming\r\nthat she had taken His Holiness under her protection. But, although\r\nno formal compact resulted from M. Guizot's overtures at Vienna,\r\nhis desire to propitiate Prince Metternich was reflected in his\r\ninstructions to his agents at the different Italian Courts. By the\r\nspring of 1847, it was evident that the Italian Liberal movement was\r\nregarded with nearly as much disapproval by the government of Louis\r\nPhilippe as by the Cabinet of Vienna.\r\n\r\nMetternich was under no illusions as to the true meaning of the events\r\nwhich were taking place in Italy. Above the popular expressions\r\nof joy at the reforms, conceded by the Pope or by the Grand Duke\r\nof Tuscany, rose the threatening cry for the expulsion of the\r\nforeigner. Unless the Liberal movement could be crushed, the Emperor,\r\nhe perceived clearly, would have to fight to retain his Italian\r\npossessions. \"Nationality,\" he bade Buol warn Charles Albert, \"was\r\nthe new device which the revolutionists had inscribed upon their\r\nbanners.\"[902] Resolutely he prepared for the struggle which he saw\r\nwas impending. Troops were poured into Lombardy and the Austrian\r\ngarrison at Ferrara was strengthened. Moreover, he was strongly\r\nsuspected of fomenting a counter-revolutionary plot at Rome, with the\r\nobject of forcibly displacing the Liberal advisers of His Holiness,\r\nand of surrounding him with members of the reactionary party. The\r\ndiscovery of this conspiracy, in which the governor of Rome was\r\ninvolved, caused an immense excitement. No certain evidence could\r\nbe procured of the participation of Austrian agents in the affair.\r\nIt was significant, however, that the garrison of Ferrara received\r\na substantial accession of strength on the very day fixed upon by\r\nthe conspirators for the execution of their plans.[903] But, if\r\nMetternich's connection with the Roman plot of July 1847 may be held\r\nto be not proven, his intention to provoke the Liberal and national\r\nparty into some ill-considered act of violence, which should furnish\r\nhim with a pretext for armed intervention, admits of no doubt.\r\nHitherto, as specified by the treaty, the garrison at Ferrara[904]\r\nhad been confined to the citadel. But now the Austrians proceeded to\r\noccupy the whole town, the troops adopting a most insulting attitude\r\ntowards the population, and especially towards the civic guard. But\r\nthis clumsy device for bringing on a collision failed in its object.\r\nIn the words of the British minister at Florence, the newly enrolled\r\ncitizen soldiers \"observed the most extraordinary moderation under the\r\nmost contumelious treatment.\"[905] The Austrian proceedings at Ferrara\r\ncalled forth a strong protest from His Holiness, who, at the same\r\ntime requested Charles Albert to send a frigate to Civita Vecchia for\r\nhis personal protection. His Sardinian Majesty promptly complied with\r\nthis demand, whereupon, the French ambassador tendered an offer of\r\nassistance on the part of his government. This proposal, however, was\r\ndeclined, no doubt being entertained at Rome, that France and Austria\r\nwere acting together in Italian affairs.[906] Thus Metternich, by his\r\naggressive attitude, had only succeeded in creating a bond of union\r\nbetween the Papal government and the Court of Turin.[907]\r\n\r\nAt the end of July, 1847, Metternich resolved to inquire of the\r\ndifferent Powers, which were parties to the treaties of 1815, whether\r\nthey, as \"the principal guardians of the political peace,\"[908]\r\nintended to maintain the territorial divisions of the Italian\r\npeninsula as settled by the Congress of Vienna. The revolution, he\r\ntold Lord Ponsonby, must now be considered as complete in the Roman\r\nStates and in Tuscany. A revolution, he explained, was accomplished,\r\nonce a government had been deprived of all power. But the real object\r\nof the party which had triumphed at Rome was to create a united Italy.\r\nThe Emperor, however, while studiously respecting the independence of\r\nthe sovereign States of the Peninsula, was determined to preserve his\r\nown Italian kingdom.[909] The British government, wrote Palmerston\r\nin reply, holds that the stipulations of treaties must everywhere\r\nbe observed, and that no changes in an agreement can properly be\r\neffected, except with the concurrence of all the Powers which are\r\nparties to it. But Her Majesty's government, at the same time, is no\r\nless strongly of opinion that the right to carry out internal reforms\r\nis a right inherent to independent sovereignty.[910] A month later, on\r\nSeptember 11, when the threatening communications made by Count Buol\r\nto the Court of Turin, and the proceedings of the military commander\r\nat Ferrara suggested that Austria might be contemplating some act of\r\naggression against the Kingdom of Sardinia and the Papal dominions,\r\nPalmerston reverted to this subject. \"The crowns of Great Britain and\r\nof Sardinia,\" he warned Metternich, \"had long been bound together\r\nby the ties of an intimate and faithful alliance, and Great Britain\r\ncould neither forget nor repudiate claims founded upon such honourable\r\ngrounds.\" The Papal States were an essential element in the political\r\nindependence of the Italian Peninsula, and no invasion of them could\r\ntake place \"without leading to consequences of great gravity and\r\nimportance.\"[911]\r\n\r\nAt the time when Palmerston was holding this language, the British\r\ngovernment had decided upon a measure, which was afterwards the\r\nsubject of much criticism. In the month of April, the Papal _nuncio_\r\nin Paris had expressed to Lord Normanby a fear that His Holiness would\r\nexperience great difficulty in carrying out his projected reforms.\r\nIt was plain that no assistance would be forthcoming from the French\r\ngovernment, and it was, in consequence, very necessary that the cause\r\nof social improvement in Italy should receive \"a more active moral\r\nsupport from England.\" If there were constitutional objections to the\r\nestablishment of direct diplomatic relations with the Holy See,[912]\r\nmight not some one, he suggested, in the confidence of Her Majesty's\r\ngovernment, be sent to Rome for the purpose of communicating with\r\nthe Pope and his ministers?[913] The Russell Cabinet was strongly\r\nin favour of acceding to this request, but the manner in which the\r\nBritish government should extend its \"moral support\" was somewhat\r\ndifficult to determine. Palmerston advocated that Lord Minto, the\r\nLord Privy Seal, should be sent upon a special mission to Turin,\r\nFlorence and Borne. The Queen, however, raised certain objections\r\nto this plan. In an able _memorandum_ Prince Albert pointed out\r\nthat to despatch a member of the government to Italy, to encourage\r\nthe rulers of the different States to adopt measures, which Austria\r\nregarded as highly dangerous to her existence as an Italian power,\r\nwas \"a most hostile step towards our old and natural ally.\" It would\r\nbe more friendly, he contended, and certainly more honest, to let\r\nit be clearly understood at Vienna that an attack upon any Italian\r\nSovereign, who was desirous of effecting administrative reforms,\r\nwould be looked upon as a violation of treaties to which England\r\nwas a party. But His Royal Highness was ready to admit that, by\r\nadopting such a policy, England would be morally bound to uphold the\r\nindependence of the Italian States, whereas the projected mission\r\nof Lord Minto would not commit her actively to interfere on their\r\nbehalf.[914] After some further discussion and correspondence\r\nPalmerston carried his point. On September 11, his already quoted\r\ndespatch was sent off to Vienna, and, a week later, Lord Minto was\r\nsupplied with his instructions and started upon his journey.\r\n\r\nModerate as was the language which Lord Minto was directed to\r\nhold at the different Italian Courts, his mission was necessarily\r\nregarded with extreme disapproval at Vienna. Yet Minto had no mandate\r\nto encourage the movement in favour of Italian unity, nor was he\r\ninstructed to counsel the adoption of any measures which could be\r\nregarded as even an indirect attempt to deprive the Emperor of his\r\nItalian possessions. On the contrary, he was to insist upon the\r\nnecessity of maintaining the peace. At Turin, he was to warn Charles\r\nAlbert of the danger of allowing his natural irritation at the\r\ninterference of Austria in his affairs to betray him into some act,\r\nwhich might furnish the Court of Vienna with a pretext for attacking\r\nhim. But Metternich, being determined to place an absolute check upon\r\nthe development of Liberal ideas, was naturally greatly annoyed that\r\na British minister should visit Florence, Rome and Turin for the\r\npurpose of congratulating the Sovereigns upon the reforms which they\r\nhad already carried out, and of urging them to persevere in the same\r\ncourse in the future.[915]\r\n\r\nAnother task, however, had been confided to Lord Minto, besides\r\nthat of counselling the Italian rulers to advance with prudence and\r\ncircumspection along the path of reform. On his way to Turin he\r\nwas instructed to visit Switzerland, where a very grave condition\r\nof affairs had arisen. By the _Federal Pact_ of 1815 Switzerland\r\nconsisted of twenty-two sovereign and independent Cantons, each of\r\nwhich possessed one vote in the Federal Diet. The repercussion of\r\nthe revolution of 1830, in France, was acutely felt in Switzerland,\r\nand, about that time, the cantonal constitutions were revised in a\r\ndemocratic spirit. Some nine years later, however, the Conservatives,\r\nby raising the cry that religion was in danger, succeeded in many of\r\nthe Cantons in regaining their lost power. The victorious party made\r\nno attempt, even in those Cantons where their ascendency was the most\r\ncomplete, to repeal the Liberal legislation of the past few years.\r\nOn the contrary, in the very Catholic cantons of Lucerne and of the\r\nValais, the popular _veto_ and the _referendum_ were introduced. It\r\nwas plainly the opinion of the clergy that their influence over the\r\npeople would enable them to obtain, by means of these democratic\r\ninstitutions, the rejection of any measure of which they disapproved.\r\nIn the Canton of Aargau, however, of which the population was half\r\nProtestant and half Catholic, the clerical party failed to establish\r\nits ascendency by peaceful means. An attempt was, accordingly, made to\r\noverturn the existing government by force. But the insurrection proved\r\nunsuccessful and the eight monasteries, the inmates of which were\r\nproved to have been actively concerned in the plot, were suppressed.\r\nThe existence of these establishments had been guaranteed by an\r\narticle of the _Federal Pact_, and the action of the Grand Council of\r\nAargau, in decreeing their abolition, was, in consequence, brought\r\nbefore the Federal Diet. The matter was not settled until the year\r\n1843, when the Canton of Aargau agreed to restore four suppressed\r\nfemale convents; a compromise which was accepted as satisfactory\r\nby the majority of the Diet. But scarcely had this controversy,\r\nwhich had evoked intense bitterness of feeling, been settled, then\r\ndisturbances broke out in the Valais. The clerical party in that\r\nCanton contrived, after severe fighting, to overturn the Radical\r\ngovernment. The success of this revolution, it was clear, was largely\r\ndue to the secret assistance which the reactionaries had received from\r\nthe Grand Council of Lucerne. Such conduct was the more inexcusable\r\nseeing that, at the time, Lucerne was the _directing Canton_ and,\r\ntherefore, the more bound to observe an attitude of impartiality.\r\nThe Jesuits were generally regarded as the chief instigators of the\r\naffair, and throughout the greater part of Switzerland a feeling of\r\nextreme hostility arose against them. But the men in power at Lucerne\r\nwere indifferent to the dislike with which the Order was regarded\r\nby the majority of their countrymen, and they, forthwith, proceeded\r\nto call in the Jesuits and to give them the complete control of all\r\nthe educational establishments in their Canton. Meanwhile, with the\r\nadmitted connivance of the Radical governments of Berne, Aargau and\r\nSoleure, volunteers were being enrolled and, at the end of the year\r\n1844, and again in April, 1845, armed bands, known as the _corps\r\nfrancs_, deliberately attacked Lucerne. But, having concluded an\r\nalliance with Uri, Zug, and Unterwalden, Lucerne successfully repelled\r\nthese invaders. In this same year the expulsion of the Jesuits from\r\nthe whole of Switzerland was moved in the Federal Diet.\r\n\r\nAs far back as the year 1832, the Cantons of Uri, Schwyz and\r\nUnterwalden, had entered into a combination, known as the _League of\r\nSarnen_, with the object of resisting the democratic tendencies of the\r\nage. The association was, subsequently, strengthened by the accession\r\nof Fribourg, Zug, Lucerne, and, in 1844, of the Valais. Early in the\r\nyear 1846, the character of the league was transformed completely.\r\nFrom a peaceful association it was converted into a military alliance,\r\nfor the purpose of upholding the right of every independent Canton to\r\nlive under such laws as its legislature might enact. The _Sonderbund_,\r\nas this alliance of the seven Catholic Cantons was called, was at\r\nonce denounced as an infraction of Article VI. of the _Federal Pact_,\r\nprescribing that \"no alliance, prejudicial either to the general\r\nconfederacy or to the rights of other Cantons, could be formed by\r\nseparate Cantons among themselves.\" A motion to that effect was,\r\naccordingly, brought forward in the Federal Diet, but no decision\r\nin its favour was obtained. Before the next year, however, in some\r\ncases by constitutional means, in others, as at Geneva, by force and\r\nviolence, the composition of the governments in several Cantons was\r\nchanged and Radical Grand Councils were installed in power. Under\r\nthese circumstances, a majority was easily obtained in favour both of\r\nthe expulsion of the Jesuits and of declaring the illegality of the\r\n_Sonderbund_. The allied Catholic Cantons, however, refused to submit\r\nto this decision of the Federal Diet and proclaimed their intention\r\nof resisting, by arms if necessary, any attempt to interfere with\r\ntheir independence. Thus, at the time when Lord Minto departed for the\r\ncontinent, all the signs pointed to the probability that Switzerland\r\nwould, before long, be the scene of a bloody civil war.\r\n\r\nThe rapid advance of democracy in Switzerland had necessarily excited\r\nthe alarm of the absolute Courts. Moreover, between the years 1830\r\nand 1840, not only the Cabinet of Vienna but the French government\r\nhad had, on several occasions, good cause to complain that, unchecked\r\nby the authorities, political refugees were allowed to concert their\r\nmeasures for disturbing the peace of neighbouring States. After 1840,\r\nthe internal disputes and the increasing lawlessness of the country\r\nbegan to attract the serious attention of all the Powers responsible\r\nfor the settlement of 1815. Both Lord Aberdeen and M. Guizot were\r\nagreed that, could the question of the Jesuits be arranged, the\r\nchief element of danger in the situation would be removed. The\r\nFrench minister consented readily to exert his influence to induce\r\nthe Pope to recall them. Let it be well understood at Rome, he wrote\r\nto Rossi, on June 6, 1845, that, should a Radical government be\r\nestablished at Geneva, there would be a majority in favour of the\r\nexpulsion of the Order in the Federal Diet. Make it perfectly clear\r\nto His Holiness that \"the fate of the disciples of Loyola is in the\r\nhands of the followers of Calvin.\"[916] Prince Metternich was at this\r\ntime instructing the Austrian ambassador at Rome to employ similar\r\narguments. But Gregory XVI. showed no disposition to interfere, and\r\nall hope had soon to be abandoned of obtaining his co-operation in the\r\naffair.[917] In the following year, the overthrow of the Conservative\r\ngovernments at Geneva and in the Canton of Vaud, and the prospect\r\nthat, in the ensuing session, the Radicals would be in a majority\r\nin the Federal Diet, increased Metternich's uneasiness. Hitherto,\r\nFrance had set her face resolutely against intervention in any shape\r\nor form. But, in the autumn of 1846, Louis Philippe, being anxious\r\nto assure himself of the neutrality of the Northern Courts in the\r\nquestion of the Spanish marriages, the Austrian Chancellor took the\r\nopportunity of proposing that the Powers should seriously take in hand\r\nthe affairs of Switzerland. M. Guizot was rather disposed to accede to\r\nthis suggestion, but the King, being still hopeful of re-establishing\r\n\"the cordial understanding,\" refused to sanction any participation\r\nin measures which might lead eventually to armed intervention.[918]\r\nIn the spring of 1847, however, when it was clear that England had\r\nno intention of forgetting the affront which she had received in the\r\nmatter of the Spanish marriages, and when, in consequence, M. Guizot\r\nwas desirous of effecting a close understanding with Austria, French\r\npolicy towards Switzerland was altered to suit the exigencies of the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nThe sympathies of Metternich and of all the absolute Courts were\r\nnecessarily on the side of the _Sonderbund_.[919] The continental\r\nCabinets were agreed that it would be highly dangerous, in the\r\nunsettled state of Europe, to allow the league of the Catholic and\r\nConservative Cantons to be dissolved by their Radical neighbours.\r\nFederal unity, Metternich maintained, was clearly the object for\r\nwhich the democrats were striving, and it was on that account that\r\nthey desired to undermine cantonal independence. But any revision of\r\nthe _Federal Pact_ would, he argued, release from their engagements\r\nthe Powers which had guaranteed the neutrality and independence of\r\nSwitzerland, and would justify them in intervening. Louis Philippe and\r\nM. Guizot, although fully disposed to endorse his views, dared not\r\nventure to employ French troops to fight the battle of the Jesuits.\r\nThey, accordingly, insinuated that, if Austria were to take the first\r\nstep, public opinion in France might be reconciled to the notion of a\r\nFrench intervention. This ingenuous proposal was promptly declined.\r\nMetternich had no idea of incurring the odium of invading Switzerland\r\nand of allowing France to declare that similar action on her part had\r\nbeen rendered necessary by the aggressiveness of Austria.[920] Thus\r\nin Swiss, as in Italian affairs, M. Guizot and Prince Metternich,\r\nnotwithstanding the harmony of their sentiments, found it impossible\r\nto devise any practical plan for concerted action.\r\n\r\nEngland, as a party to the settlement of 1815, had an unquestionable\r\nright to be consulted in any arrangement tending to alter the\r\npolitical position of Switzerland in the European system. But, owing\r\nto her geographical situation, she was less directly concerned\r\nthan France, Austria or Prussia in the internal condition of the\r\nConfederation. The British government was, consequently, in a\r\nposition to regard the question from a more detached and impartial\r\nstandpoint. Moreover, the letters of Mr. Grote,[921] the historian\r\nof Greece, to the _Spectator_, supplied the English public with far\r\nbetter information about Swiss politics than was to be obtained in the\r\nofficial press of continental States. Palmerston had no intention of\r\ndiscussing the questions as to whether the alliance of the Catholic\r\nCantons should be looked upon as an infraction of the _Federal Pact_,\r\nand as to whether the action of the Radical majority in the Diet, in\r\ndecreeing the expulsion of the Jesuits, constituted a violation of\r\ncantonal sovereignty and independence. It is clear that, from an early\r\ndate, he adopted the view, propounded by Mr. Grote, that, whereas the\r\nso-called Radical Cantons represented the wealth, the intelligence,\r\nthe industry, the population and the progressive elements of\r\nSwitzerland, the Cantons of the _Sonderbund_ were, in every respect,\r\nthe stationary and backward portions of the Republic. From these\r\npremises it followed logically that, although it might be possible\r\nfor the allied Catholic Cantons to break up the Confederation, it\r\nwas not in their power to guide it or to hold it together.[922] He,\r\ntherefore, proposed both to Prince Metternich and M. Guizot, that they\r\nshould endeavour to persuade the Catholic leaders to dissolve their\r\nalliance.[923] This solution of the difficulty, as may be supposed,\r\nwas not adopted by either of the statesmen to whom it was made. On\r\nthe contrary, Metternich at this time was arranging to furnish the\r\n_Sonderbund_ with arms, and was seriously considering whether he\r\nshould place the services of an Austrian general at its disposal,\r\nwhile M. Guizot was giving secret instructions for the despatch of\r\nwarlike stores to Lucerne from the arsenal at Besançon.[924]\r\n\r\nLord Minto, in his conversations with M. Ochsenbein, the President of\r\nthe Federal Diet, was charged to counsel forbearance and moderation.\r\n\"Her Majesty's government,\" wrote Palmerston, \"as the sincere\r\nand disinterested friend of Switzerland, could not but exhort all\r\nparties to abate pretensions, however just they may be thought, and\r\nto yield somewhat of rights, however valid they may be considered,\r\nrather than begin an appeal to arms, the consequences of which it\r\nwould be easier to lament than to foresee.\" He was not prepared to\r\ndeny that the _Federal Pact_ might stand in need of revision. It\r\nwas alleged, however, that the Diet proposed \"to sweep away the\r\nseparate sovereignty of the several Cantons in order to blend the\r\nwhole of Switzerland into one single Republic.\" He must, therefore,\r\nremind the Swiss government that \"the fundamental principle upon\r\nwhich the arrangements of the Treaty of Vienna, in regard to\r\nSwitzerland, repose, is the separate sovereignty of the several\r\nCantons.\" Any attempt to alter the basis of the political organization\r\nof the Republic would inevitably entail civil war and foreign\r\nintervention.[925]\r\n\r\nYet, notwithstanding the pacific spirit in which Lord Minto's\r\ninstructions were drawn up, Palmerston has been freely accused of\r\ninciting the Radical Cantons to begin hostilities. Animosity to\r\nLouis Philippe and his principal minister, assert his detractors,\r\nwas at this period the mainspring of his policy. Thus, when the\r\nFrench government evinced a disposition to favour the cause of the\r\n_Sonderbund_, Palmerston, having satisfied himself of the military\r\nsuperiority of the Radical Cantons, secretly urged them to attack\r\ntheir weaker neighbours, in the hope that the forcible dissolution of\r\nthe Catholic alliance would entail the downfall of M. Guizot. This\r\ncharge has been reiterated in the recently published letters of Sir\r\nRobert Morier. Mr. David Morier, Sir Robert's father, had been for\r\nmany years British minister in Switzerland. In the summer of 1847,\r\nhowever, being in England on leave, he was not allowed to return to\r\nhis post, because, says his son, he was instinctively a peacemaker\r\nand, therefore, no longer a suitable instrument to execute the policy\r\nupon which Lord Palmerston had decided to embark.[926] But a perusal\r\nof Mr. Morier's despatches suggests another, and an infinitely more\r\nprobable, explanation of his recall. When affairs in Switzerland were\r\nbeginning to assume a dangerous aspect, he is to be found expressing\r\nviews with which Lord Palmerston would have heartily agreed. Writing\r\nto Lord Aberdeen, in June, 1844, on the subject of the Jesuits, Mr.\r\nMorier points out that this intrusion of a powerful foreign agency\r\ninto all the concerns of the Confederation raises the question\r\nwhether, \"self-preservation being the first law of States, the claim\r\nof cantonal sovereignty should not be made to yield to the exigencies\r\nof the general welfare.\" Again, some months later, speaking of the\r\nintroduction of the Jesuits into Lucerne, he warns his chief that\r\nLucerne \"must be inscribed upon the list of Cantons with Fribourg,\r\nSchwyz and the Valais, subjected, henceforward, through their Jesuit\r\ninstitutions, to the influence of a foreign and anti-national power of\r\nthe most dangerous tendency to the peace of the Confederation.\"[927]\r\nBut, during the winter of 1846, an unprovoked assault was committed\r\nupon one of his sons, Burnet Morier, by an excited Radical of Berne.\r\nThe young man with commendable promptitude felled his assailant to\r\nthe ground,[928] and, under these circumstances, Palmerston probably\r\nconsidered that the affair need not be made the subject of an official\r\ndemand for reparation. Mr. Morier, however, thought otherwise,\r\nand his indignation appears to have transformed him into a strong\r\nsupporter of the _Sonderbund_. The contrast between the sentiments,\r\ncontained in his _memorandum_ on Swiss affairs, submitted to the\r\nForeign Office in February, 1847,[929] and those expressed in his\r\nearlier despatches, must have given Lord Palmerston food for serious\r\nreflection. Without doubt, he must have come to the conclusion that a\r\nman burning with resentment against the Radical leaders was hardly as\r\nqualified, as his son seems to have supposed, to exercise a moderating\r\ninfluence upon the passions of contending parties.\r\n\r\nLord Minto, having arrived in Switzerland, lost no time in placing\r\nhimself in communication with M. Ochsenbein. The election of this\r\nperson, who two years before had commanded the _corps francs_ in their\r\nraid upon Lucerne, to the post of President of the Federal Diet, had\r\ngreatly exasperated the Catholics. Lord Minto, however, reported that\r\nhe found him most reasonable, and, to all appearances, sincerely\r\ndesirous of discovering some means of averting an outbreak of\r\nhostilities. The Jesuits, he assured the English minister, constituted\r\nthe chief obstacle to a peaceful settlement, and, could they be\r\nremoved, all danger of war would disappear. Palmerston, on receiving\r\nthis information, at once instructed Minto, who by that time had\r\npassed on to Italy, to use every endeavour, while at Rome, to persuade\r\nHis Holiness to intervene.[930] But, meanwhile, in Switzerland the\r\nchances of maintaining the peace were hourly diminishing. Both sides\r\nwere now openly preparing for war, and, on October 29, the deputies of\r\nthe Catholic Cantons formally quitted the Federal Diet. On that same\r\nday Lord Palmerston made a last effort to avert a rupture. He enjoined\r\nthe British _chargé d'affaires_ at Berne to seek out M. Ochsenbein\r\nand to endeavour to prevail upon him to postpone the execution of any\r\nirrevocable measure, until the result of Lord Minto's mission to Rome\r\nshould be known. M. Ochsenbein's only reply to this communication was\r\nhastily to convene the Diet, which forthwith decreed the dissolution\r\nof the _Sonderbund_ by the armed forces of the Federal executive.[931]\r\n\r\nTwo days later, on November 6, the Duc de Broglie, who had recently\r\nsucceeded Sainte-Aulaire, as ambassador in London, submitted a project\r\nof intervention to Lord Palmerston. Let the Powers, proposed M.\r\nGuizot, offer to mediate on the basis that the question of the Jesuits\r\nshould be settled by the Pope, and that the other points in dispute\r\nshould form the subject of a conference, at which each of the Cantons\r\nshould be represented. In the meantime, the contending parties would\r\nbe invited to suspend hostilities--a refusal to comply releasing the\r\nPowers from their engagements to the Confederation and entitling them\r\nto enforce their demands by whatever measures they might subsequently\r\nagree to adopt.[932] Palmerston's official answer was not sent off to\r\nParis until November 16. It was in the form of a counter-proposition.\r\nThe British government, he declared, \"could not go the length of\r\nthinking\" that the outbreak of civil war could release the Powers from\r\nthose pledges into which they had entered to maintain the neutrality\r\nof Switzerland. Furthermore, it considered that the presence of the\r\nJesuits upon the territory of the Confederation, in opposition to the\r\nwishes of the majority of the Cantons, constituted a real grievance.\r\nHer Majesty's government, under the circumstances, before consenting\r\nto join with France and the other Power in offering to mediate, must\r\nmake two conditions. In the first place, the removal of the Jesuits,\r\nwhether by a decision to be obtained from the Pope, or by an act of\r\nsovereign authority on the part of the Cantons in which the Order was\r\nestablished, must be the basis of any arrangement proposed by the\r\nPowers to the contending parties. Secondly, it was to be distinctly\r\nunderstood that a refusal by either side to accept mediation must not\r\nbe made the ground for armed interference in the internal affairs of\r\nSwitzerland.[933]\r\n\r\nIn Paris, at Berlin, and at Vienna, it had been intended to hold very\r\ndifferent language to M. Ochsenbein and his colleagues. Nevertheless,\r\nM. Guizot, although stipulating for certain trifling modifications,\r\naccepted the British proposal. The assent of Prussia and of Austria\r\nwas obtained, but it was given with the utmost reluctance.[934]\r\nPalmerston was, in point of fact, completely master of the situation.\r\nThe condition of Germany was so unsettled, the appearance of affairs\r\nin Italy was so alarming, that Metternich could not attack the\r\nRadicals of Berne except in combination with France and, in the Swiss\r\nquestion, Louis Philippe and M. Guizot dared not act with the absolute\r\nCourts in opposition to the constitutional government of England.[935]\r\nNicholas, having no direct interest in the matter, was content to\r\nadopt whatever course might commend itself to the Cabinet of Vienna.\r\nThe five governments being thus agreed, an _identic note_ was, on\r\nNovember 26, drawn up in London for presentation to the President\r\nof the Diet, and to the official organ of the _Sonderbund_ by the\r\nrepresentatives of the Powers in Switzerland. But, while ministers and\r\ndiplomatists had been talking and writing, the Federal executive had\r\nacted. No sooner had the Diet, on November 4, decreed the forcible\r\nsuppression of the _Sonderbund_ than the Genevese general, Dufour,\r\nwho had at his disposal an army of 100,000 men and 260 guns, was\r\nordered to begin operations. The isolated canton of Fribourg having\r\nbeen easily overwhelmed, the Federal commander advanced with his whole\r\nforce against Lucerne. Salis-Soglio, a Protestant of the Grisons,\r\nwhose army amounted to some 80,000 troops with 74 guns, awaited him\r\nin a selected position between the Reuss and the Lake of Zug. The\r\ndecisive battle was fought on November 23, Dufour's victory was\r\ncomplete. On the following day, the Jesuits and the executive council\r\nhaving fled, Lucerne surrendered. The Valais, the last of the seven\r\nCantons to abandon the struggle, capitulated on the 29th. Twenty-five\r\ndays after the Diet had formally resolved upon its suppression, the\r\n_Sonderbund_ ceased to exist.\r\n\r\nIn almost all accounts of these events Palmerston's proceedings\r\nhave been misrepresented. According to his detractors, he cunningly\r\ninveigled the Powers into an exchange of views with the pretended\r\nobject of averting civil war in Switzerland, while in reality he was\r\nsecretly urging the Federal executive to open the campaign against\r\nthe _Sonderbund_.[936] Even Liberals, in sympathy with his policy,\r\ndescribe him as having deliberately protracted the negotiations\r\nin London, in order that the Radicals should be able to crush\r\nthe Catholic Cantons without fear of foreign interference.[937]\r\nPalmerston, it is perfectly clear, was strongly opposed to direct\r\nintervention and, moreover, was disposed to think that an unsolicited\r\noffer on the part of the Powers to assist the Swiss to settle their\r\ninternal disputes would inflame their national pride, and rather\r\ntend to aggravate, than to diminish, the gravity of the situation.\r\nIt is possible, therefore, that he may to some extent have delayed\r\nthe negotiations. But the alleged waste of time cannot at the most\r\nhave exceeded a very few days, seeing that the French note was only\r\nsubmitted to him on November 9, and that his counter-proposal had been\r\nagreed to by the Powers and was ready for transmission to Switzerland\r\non the 26th. To contend that Palmerston supposed that, by delaying\r\nthe negotiations for two or three days, he would enable the Radicals\r\nto achieve their purpose, is to credit him with a knowledge of the\r\nmilitary weakness of the _Sonderbund_ which he most certainly did not\r\npossess. If he in any way retarded the final drafting of the proposed\r\noffer of mediation, it is infinitely more probable that he so acted in\r\nthe hope that Minto's efforts at Rome to induce the Pope to recall the\r\nJesuits from Lucerne might prove successful and that, in consequence,\r\nthe two parties might be able to settle their quarrel without an\r\nappeal to arms and without foreign interference.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Morier, however, asserts most positively that Palmerston\r\n\"instigated Peel to perform his celebrated feat of precipitating\r\nthe war of the _Sonderbund_.\"[938] In his _Mémoires_ M. Guizot has\r\nreproduced a letter from M. de Bois-le-Comte, the French ambassador\r\nto the Confederation, in which it is stated that, upon receipt of the\r\nnews from London that the Powers intended to propose mediation, Mr.\r\nPeel sent the chaplain of the British legation to the headquarters of\r\nGeneral Dufour to apprise him of the state of affairs and to urge him\r\nimmediately to march upon Lucerne and try conclusions with the army of\r\nthe _Sonderbund_.[939] It is evident that, if there be any foundation\r\nof truth in these stories, neither the instructions with which Lord\r\nMinto, a member of the government, was supplied, nor the official\r\ndespatch of October 29, which was to be communicated to M. Ochsenbein,\r\ncan have been the expression of Lord Palmerston's real policy. His\r\nveritable intentions must have been conveyed in private letters[940]\r\nto the British _chargé d'affaires_ at Berne, it never having been\r\nsuggested that he employed any secret agent in the affair. The\r\nquestion as to who acted as British minister to the Confederation, at\r\nthis period, is, therefore, of extreme importance. It is inconceivable\r\nthat Palmerston, if he really were engaged in prosecuting the\r\nMachiavellian designs imputed to him, should not have replaced Mr.\r\nMorier by an Arthur Aston, a Henry Bulwer, or some other tried and\r\ntrusted agent. But in point of fact the business of the legation,\r\nduring the whole of this critical time, was left in charge of a young\r\nsecretary, Mr. Peel. Now Peel was the eldest son of Sir Robert, who,\r\nto the day of his death, never forgave Palmerston for his desertion of\r\nthe Tory party in 1828.[941] Is it credible that Palmerston can have\r\nentrusted the conduct of an affair of the kind, suggested by M. Guizot\r\nand Sir Robert Morier, to a comparative stranger, a young man of\r\ntwenty-five, the son of his political opponent and personal enemy?\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it is highly probable that Palmerston's despatch of\r\nOctober 29, although written with a very different object, did,\r\nin effect, precipitate the conflict between the Radical Cantons\r\nand the _Sonderbund_. As Mr. Peel, without doubt, rightly divined,\r\nM. Ochsenbein, notwithstanding the pacific language which he had\r\nheld to Lord Minto, had no real desire to see the dispute amicably\r\nsettled.[942] Federal unity was the end which he and his friends had\r\nset themselves to attain, and they were convinced that nothing but\r\nphysical force would induce the Catholic and Conservative Cantons to\r\nrenounce their sovereign rights. By \"blood and iron\" alone could the\r\nsuccess of their policy be achieved. Hence the prospect that England\r\nintended to exert herself at Rome, in favour of Papal intervention,\r\nmay have driven the Radicals of Berne to immediate action. They may\r\nhave argued that, should His Holiness consent to recall the Jesuits\r\nand should the _Sonderbund_, in consequence, be peacefully dissolved,\r\nan excellent opportunity would be lost of reducing the Conservative\r\nCantons to submission.\r\n\r\nThe _identic note_ of November 26, 1847, was to have been communicated\r\nto the contending parties, on behalf of Great Britain, by Sir\r\nStratford Canning. His instructions, however, provided that he\r\nshould not present it if, upon his arrival in Switzerland, he should\r\nfind that the _Sonderbund_ had capitulated and that the war was at\r\nan end.[943] Canning, in consequence, made no offer of mediation,\r\nbut remained about three weeks in Switzerland for the purpose of\r\nimpressing upon M. Ochsenbein and his colleagues the expediency of\r\ntreating the defeated Cantons with consideration, and of refraining\r\nfrom any measures which might furnish other Powers with a pretext\r\nfor intervention. France, Austria, and Prussia, however, adopted a\r\ndifferent procedure. M. de Bois-le-Comte received the _identic note_\r\non November 29, and, forthwith, despatched a copy of it both to the\r\nFederal Diet and to the leaders of the _Sonderbund_, notwithstanding\r\nthat Lucerne had already surrendered and that it was evident that the\r\nValais could not hold out much longer.[944] His example was followed\r\nby the ministers of Austria and Prussia. To these communications\r\nthe executive at Berne, the members of which had expressed to Sir\r\nStratford Canning their gratification at the attitude adopted by Great\r\nBritain, sent an answer couched in very decided language. The offer\r\nof mediation was rejected, not only because hostilities had ceased,\r\nbut because it was impossible to recognize the principle upon which\r\nthe proposal was based. If the Confederation were at war with another\r\nState, it might, or might not, entertain an offer of mediation, but it\r\ncould not admit, under any circumstances, the claim of the Powers to\r\ntreat as belligerents the Cantons of the _Sonderbund_. The treaties\r\nby which the Confederation had been constituted provided only for one\r\nDiet and for one Federal executive. The alliance of the seven Cantons\r\nwas simply an act of rebellion which the central government had been\r\nstrong enough to deal with effectually.[945]\r\n\r\nThe overthrow of the _Sonderbund_ and the haughty reply returned by\r\nthe Diet to the French, the Austrian, and the Prussian notes caused a\r\nprofound sensation. The inability of the absolute Courts and of the\r\ngovernment of M. Guizot to render assistance to the Cantons, which\r\nhad sought to resist the decrees of the majority in the Swiss Diet,\r\nwas made manifest to the world. Italian nationalists, German Liberals,\r\nFrench reformers, acclaimed the victory of the Radical executive as\r\na triumph for their cause. In governmental circles, at Vienna and\r\nat Berlin, there was no disposition to under-rate the gravity of\r\nthe situation. Largely owing to the restraining influence of Lord\r\nMinto, central Italy still presented a certain outward appearance of\r\ntranquillity.[946] But Sicily and Naples were in open revolution, and\r\nKing \"Bomba,\" who had, hitherto, set his face sternly against all\r\nreforms, was, in January, 1848, compelled to concede a constitution.\r\nMeanwhile, throughout the Peninsula the feeling of hostility to\r\nAustria was growing in intensity. Encouraged by Lord Minto, Sardinia,\r\nTuscany, and the Papal States agreed to abolish all internal lines\r\nof customs and to form a commercial league, after the manner of the\r\nGerman _Zollverein_.[947] The significance of this measure was clearly\r\nperceived by Metternich. On December 14, he directed Diedrichstein\r\nto acquaint Palmerston that the condition of Italy would necessitate\r\na large increase of the Austrian army in Lombardy.[948] \"You and I,\"\r\nhe confided to his old friend, Radetzky, \"are not destined to end\r\nour days in peace. . . . It has been reserved for the present age to\r\nwitness the spectacle of a Liberal Pope.\"[949]\r\n\r\nThe forcible dissolution of the alliance of the Catholic Cantons made\r\nit the more necessary, the German Cabinets declared, for the Powers\r\nvigilantly to watch over the proceedings of the Federal Diet. The\r\nconference, which it had been proposed to hold upon Swiss affairs,\r\nmust, they insisted, still take place.[950] The British government,\r\nhowever, altogether dissented from this view. The _Sonderbund_ no\r\nlonger existed, the Jesuits had fled, and Palmerston, therefore,\r\ncould see no occasion for any deliberations upon the domestic affairs\r\nof the Confederation. England, in any case, he announced, must now\r\ndecline to take part in a conference. M. Guizot adopted a different\r\nattitude. If Palmerston were resolved to pose as the patron of\r\nRadicals and revolutionists, why should not he come forward as the\r\nchampion of order and stability? The Austrian, Count Coloredo, and\r\nthe Prussian, General von Radowitz, who had been despatched to Paris\r\nby their respective governments, found him most favourably disposed.\r\nIt was very flattering to his vanity that at this crisis the Courts\r\nof Vienna and of Berlin should be prepared to defer to his opinions\r\nand should send their emissaries to Paris to consult him. But from\r\nLondon he received a word of warning which made a considerable\r\nimpression upon him. It would evoke, wrote his friend the Duc de\r\nBroglie, recollections of the Holy Alliance and savour overmuch of the\r\ndeliberations at Laybach and Verona,[951] were France to take part in\r\na conference which England had declined to attend.[952]\r\n\r\nIn his conversations with Coloredo and Radowitz, M. Guizot,\r\nconsequently, deprecated the notion of assembling a conference. Let\r\nthem for the moment, he urged, be content with formally declaring to\r\nthe Diet that the Powers were resolved not to suffer the violation of\r\nthe principle of cantonal sovereignty and independence. Should their\r\nrepresentations be unheeded, the question of active intervention\r\ncould be more conveniently discussed at a later date. He had, they\r\nmust not forget, his parliamentary position to consider. In the\r\ncoming session, M. Thiers was preparing to assail his foreign policy\r\nwith the utmost virulence. Metternich consented readily to adopt\r\nthese suggestions. Far from desiring to aggravate the difficulties\r\nof M. Guizot, he considered it of supreme importance that he should\r\nremain in office.[953] A joint note, dated January 18, 1848, was,\r\naccordingly, drawn up and presented to the Federal executive. Coloredo\r\nand Radowitz, thereupon, quitted Paris. It was clearly inexpedient\r\nthat these agents of the absolute Courts should be present in the\r\nFrench capital, during the heated debates to which the reply to the\r\nAddress was expected to give rise. But their deliberations were to\r\nbe regarded as merely suspended, not as definitely concluded. In the\r\nspring they were to return and resume their discussions. But this\r\nplan was not destined to be realized. Before the time appointed for\r\ntheir second meeting with M. Guizot, the storm burst and swept away\r\nthe Orleans Monarchy. The revolutionary contagion spread rapidly to\r\nBerlin and to Vienna. Metternich, compelled to fly, sought refuge\r\nin England, in company with Prince Wittgenstein, M. Guizot, and\r\nother ultra-conservative statesmen. At the news of the downfall\r\nof the redoubtable Chancellor the Milanese flew to arms. After a\r\nmemorable conflict of five days' duration, Radetzky retired upon the\r\nQuadrilateral, to prepare for the struggle with Charles Albert, who\r\nhad thrown down the gauntlet to Austria and marched to the assistance\r\nof the Lombards.\r\n\r\nA history of Franco-British relations, during the reign of Louis\r\nPhilippe, is not concerned with the internal reasons which contributed\r\nto his downfall. It is sufficient to point out that the existence of\r\nthe Orleans Monarchy was necessarily precarious, seeing that it was in\r\nthe nature of a compromise which had only been grudgingly acquiesced\r\nin by the nation. The revolution by which it was overwhelmed was, in\r\nthe words of Lamartine, \"_une revolution de mépris_.\" All classes were\r\nthoroughly disgusted with the policy of M. Guizot and indignant at the\r\nnumerous public and private scandals[954] brought to light, during\r\nthe year 1847. In a constitutional State a change of government is\r\nthe remedy provided for such a condition of affairs. Louis Philippe,\r\nhowever, was too attached to his system of personal government\r\nwillingly to part with a minister, who never attempted to restrict\r\nhim to the _rôle_ of a constitutional sovereign.[955] His last\r\nCabinet, he protested, to the day of his death, had the support of\r\nthe majority of the Chamber. But the servile body of placemen, which\r\nformed the ministerial party, in no way represented the opinion of the\r\nnation. The people with one accord condemned the proceedings of the\r\ngovernment and identified the King with the unpopular actions of his\r\nprincipal minister. On February 23, 1848, a demonstration in favour of\r\nparliamentary reform, followed by a tumult in the streets, sufficed to\r\ndestroy the discredited _régime_.\r\n\r\nThe rupture of \"the cordial understanding\" with England was followed\r\nso closely by the downfall of the monarchy, as to suggest that there\r\nmust have been a connection between the two events. That the quarrel\r\nwith England was one of the contributory causes of the revolution is\r\nalmost universally admitted. English writers have generally referred\r\nto the events of '48 with some complacency, as the just retribution\r\nwhich promptly overtook Louis Philippe. So shrewd an observer as\r\nBaron Stockmar appears to have been convinced that the revelations\r\nin connection with the Spanish marriages did the \"Citizen King\" an\r\nincalculable amount of harm in the eyes of the French people and\r\nprecipitated his overthrow.[956] Now, it is clear that the Spanish\r\nmarriages had one effect which took those who were responsible for\r\nthem completely by surprise. M. Guizot had confidently anticipated\r\nthat, whatever other consequences might flow from them, they would be\r\nacclaimed as a great diplomatic triumph achieved at the expense of\r\nEngland. But the event completely falsified his expectations. The men,\r\nwho in the question of the right of search, in the Pritchard affair,\r\nand in many other matters, had constantly accused him of truckling\r\nto England, were the first to denounce him for having sacrificed\r\n\"the cordial understanding\" to a purely dynastic object. It is more\r\nthan probable that the indignation professed by M. Thiers and his\r\nfriends was not very sincere and was, to a large extent, assumed for\r\npurposes of party politics. But their words, none the less, made a\r\ndeep impression upon the middle-classes which had hitherto steadfastly\r\nsupported the _régime_ of July. These people, says Lord Normanby,\r\nwere convinced that their material interests had suffered owing to\r\nthe rupture of the English alliance. The construction of railways in\r\nFrance had led, as in England, to a wild outburst of speculation. The\r\nundue inflation of prices was followed by the inevitable reaction.\r\nThis unexpected depreciation in the value of the shares of the new\r\ncompanies was not, however, ascribed to its true causes. Disappointed\r\nspeculators persuaded themselves that their losses were due to the\r\ndisinclination of the British public to invest in French railways,\r\nowing to the change which the Spanish marriages had wrought in the\r\npolitical relations of the two countries.[957]\r\n\r\nBut in so far as the revolution of '48 is concerned, the true\r\nimportance of the break-up of \"the cordial understanding\" consists in\r\nthe policy which M. Guizot, in consequence, saw fit to adopt. It is\r\nundeniable that his attitude towards the Italian national movement and\r\nin the Swiss question was severely condemned by the majority of his\r\ncountrymen, and proved most injurious to the monarchy. Men perceived\r\nclearly that the only result of his unnatural alliance with the\r\nCabinet of Vienna had been enormously to diminish French influence at\r\nRome and at Turin. In Switzerland his policy was seen to have been\r\neven more ineffectual.[958] All his efforts had been directed to the\r\npreservation of the _Sonderbund_. Nevertheless, the alliance of the\r\nreactionary cantons had been promptly and ignominiously dissolved,\r\nwhilst his proffered mediation had been rejected with a haughty\r\nintimation that the victorious party intended to settle its affairs\r\nwithout his interference. It has been urged, however, in his defence\r\nthat his difficulties were greatly aggravated by Lord Palmerston,\r\nwhose deliberate purpose it was to thwart him on every occasion. A\r\nsecret alliance, it has been said, existed between the British Foreign\r\nMinister and M. Thiers. Gossip on this subject had been rife ever\r\nsince the close of the year 1844. It would seem that about that time\r\nsome friendly messages from Palmerston were conveyed to M. Thiers by\r\nSir John Easthope,[959] the proprietor of the _Morning Chronicle_,\r\nwhich was generally regarded as Palmerston's especial organ. In the\r\nfollowing year, when M. Thiers visited London, Sir Anthony Panizzi,\r\nan Italian political exile, and the chief librarian of the British\r\nMuseum, took great credit to himself for having cemented a good\r\nunderstanding between the two statesmen.[960] Palmerston afterwards\r\ndenied absolutely that their interviews were in any way connected\r\nwith a \"conspiracy against M. Guizot.\"[961] Greville, however,\r\naccuses him of having, during the controversy on the subject of the\r\nSpanish marriages, permitted Lord Normanby to supply M. Thiers with\r\nthe diplomatic documents bearing upon the question. Greville was\r\nso ready to believe anything discreditable about Palmerston that\r\nhe cannot, as a rule, be looked upon as an altogether trustworthy\r\nwitness. But, at the time referred to, he was in a position to speak\r\nof his own knowledge of what was taking place, inasmuch as he was\r\nin Paris for the express purpose of trying to re-establish \"the\r\ncordial understanding\" and was, moreover, the guest of Lord Normanby\r\nat the British embassy.[962] His testimony, therefore, coupled with\r\nthe corroborative evidence to be found in the published letters of\r\nPanizzi, does suggest that certain of Thiers' very damaging criticisms\r\nof M. Guizot may have been inspired by Lord Palmerston.[963] But,\r\nhad the policy of M. Guizot been supported by public opinion, the\r\nintrigues of a foreign minister with his chief political opponent\r\nwould have tended to strengthen, rather than to weaken, his position.\r\nThe whole affair, indeed, is not of much importance. Some of Thiers'\r\nnewspaper articles may have been based upon information improperly\r\nsupplied to him by the agents of Lord Palmerston, but his great\r\nspeech on the Spanish marriages was not delivered until February 4,\r\n1847,[964] when the British _blue book_ was at the disposal of any one\r\nwho might desire to purchase it.\r\n\r\nBut the more serious charge has been made that Palmerston's whole\r\npolicy, at this period, was subordinated to his desire to avenge\r\nthe defeat he had sustained in the Spanish marriages.[965] His\r\nattitude in the Swiss and Italian questions has been fully explained.\r\nIt is difficult to see how any British minister could have acted\r\ndifferently. Had Aberdeen been in office, it may safely be surmised\r\nthat, out of consideration for Austria, he would not have advocated\r\nthe despatch of one of his colleagues upon such a mission, as was\r\nconfided to a member of Lord John Russell's government. But, without\r\ndoubt, he would have furnished his agents at the Italian Courts with\r\ninstructions substantially the same as those drawn up for the guidance\r\nof Lord Minto. In the Swiss affair both Aberdeen and Palmerston sought\r\nto avert civil war and foreign intervention by inducing the Pope to\r\nrecall the Jesuits from Lucerne. There is, in short, a continuity in\r\nthe British policy, whether conducted by Aberdeen or by Palmerston,\r\nnot to be found in that of M. Guizot. His _rapprochement_ with the\r\nCabinet of Vienna obliged him to adopt towards the Liberal and\r\nnational movements in progress throughout Europe the views of Prince\r\nMetternich. The precise reasons which induced him to make overtures\r\nto Austria can only be conjectured. Having shattered \"the cordial\r\nunderstanding,\" he may have thought that he must be able to show that\r\nhe had substituted for the English, the Austrian, alliance. Perhaps\r\nhe may have had some idea of isolating England, by means of the close\r\nrelations which he proposed to establish between the government of the\r\n\"Citizen King\" and the absolute Courts. But, be his motives what they\r\nmay, his dealings with Metternich, in 1847, were unquestionably one of\r\nthe chief reasons of the revolution of '48.[966]\r\n\r\nFor the first time, between the years 1830 and 1848, the attempt was\r\nseriously made by the French and English governments to establish,\r\nas a primary principle of policy, the necessity of maintaining close\r\nand intimate relations between the two countries. The result, on the\r\nwhole, disappointed expectations. The great work of Talleyrand's old\r\nage, the cementing of a good understanding between the Whigs and\r\nthe Orleans' Monarchy, without doubt, deterred the absolute Courts\r\nfrom intervening in French affairs after the Revolution of July.\r\nUnquestionably, also, it averted a great war in the question of the\r\nseparation of Belgium from Holland. But, on subsequent occasions, it\r\ndid not prevent grave differences of opinion from arising between\r\nthe two governments. The time had not yet come when \"the cordial\r\nunderstanding\" could be placed upon a firm and durable basis. The\r\nmaintenance of the settlement, agreed to after the great war, was\r\nstill the foundation of British policy in Europe. France, on the\r\nother hand, chafed bitterly at the conditions imposed upon her by the\r\nCongress of Vienna. Even among the peace-loving middle-classes the\r\nhope was fondly entertained that the man would arise who, \"_à grands\r\ncoups de sabre_,\" should destroy the treaties of 1815 and give back\r\nto France her \"natural frontiers.\" Bonapartism was a living force\r\nby reason of the existence of this feeling. Louis Philippe and his\r\nministers sought to allay the restlessness which it engendered by\r\nan active policy in the Mediterranean and in more distant waters.\r\nSuspicions and jealousies, the consequences of more than a hundred\r\nyears of war and rivalry, were thus kept alive. French and British\r\nofficials, whether of high rank or of low degree, continued to regard\r\neach other with instinctive hostility. Bulwer was no less anxious\r\nto outwit his colleague, Bresson, than was Pritchard to thwart his\r\nfellow-consul, Meerenhout. Nevertheless, the policy which finally\r\nbroke up the alliance was not a policy which commended itself to the\r\nFrench people. Palmerston's views upon European affairs, between 1846\r\nand 1848, accorded far more with the sentiments of the majority of\r\nFrenchmen than did those of M. Guizot; and his quarrel was not with\r\nthe French nation, but with the government of Louis Philippe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                INDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abd-el-Kader, Algerian

He also\r\nspeaks of a conversation with Esterhazy, and talks of an interview of\r\ntwo hours' duration with Palmerston. The author of this communication\r\nwas perhaps Ellice. The evidence of Greville's _Journal_ seems to\r\nmake it very improbable that he was responsible for it.

Guizot\r\nby his widow, and were carried off by him in February, 1848.
