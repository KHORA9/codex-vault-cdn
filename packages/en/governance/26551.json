In fact, there can be no general settlement of many\r\nphases of this question, for each and every library must decide what\r\nits own policy and attitude shall be toward this class of publications.\r\n\r\nIt is generally admitted that some libraries ought to have all the\r\npublications that are made for distribution, and therefore a system of\r\ndepository libraries is maintained by the government. The libraries\r\nwhich are not favored with this privilege are compelled to make a\r\nselection from the great number of documents and there is the essence\r\nof the problem for discussion here. The question of what to get\r\ninvolves the selection of certain publications which will be useful to\r\npresent patrons of the library and the acquisition of those for which a\r\ndemand can be created. For instance, if the library is located in a\r\nrural section, there will be a big demand for publications relating to\r\nagriculture, and a larger proportion of such documents will be secured\r\nthan for other subjects. If the students of the high school are\r\ninterested in debating present day questions, the publications of the\r\ngovernment relating to the existing political and economic conditions\r\nwill be in demand. In the final analysis, the librarian must feel the\r\npulse of the community, as it were, and secure the classes of\r\ngovernment material which correspond most nearly to the demand. At the\r\nsame time, by making use of bibliographies, of department lists of\r\npublications and of the reference section in the Documents Office, the\r\ndemand for this class of literature can be materially increased and\r\ndocuments secured which are not already in the library.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this discussion is to suggest a list of government\r\npublications which will be of use in a small library. Before doing so,\r\nthe various methods of securing documents must be mentioned, as the way\r\nwill be indicated with each document serial in the following list.\r\nFirst of all, there is the system of depository distribution which is\r\nbased on the act of January 12, 1895. The idea is to place in all\r\nsections of the country complete collections of all public documents\r\nwhich are printed and made for distribution. This privilege is granted\r\nby law or through the request of senators and representatives. The\r\nsecond way in which large numbers of documents are distributed is\r\nthrough the congressional quota. This practice is a very old one, being\r\nused for the first time in 1791. Each member of Congress is given a\r\nquota of all documents published by that body, the number varying with\r\neach document. These are distributed by the order of the congressmen\r\nand are sent out under their franks. As a rule, the libraries will\r\nreceive very prompt and courteous attention from their representative\r\nin Congress to any request made for publications. Thirdly, the\r\ndepartments and bureaus have mailing lists including public officials,\r\ninstitutions of various kinds and interested people. Usually a request\r\nby a library to be placed upon such a list is granted; if not, a letter\r\nto the congressman will bring the desired result. Finally, the\r\nSuperintendent of Documents is authorized to sell the government\r\npublications at a price sufficient to cover the actual expense of\r\npaper, press work and binding. The amount is always small because the\r\nmain costs of typesetting and stereotyping are eliminated from the\r\nprice. There are some publications which are secured by sale only, this\r\nrule applying to libraries as well as to individuals.\r\n\r\nThe list of publications which will be useful is as follows: The\r\n_Farmers' Bulletins_ of the Department of Agriculture are brief popular\r\narticles which give in simple, concise language the results of\r\ninvestigations and experiments. They also outline methods for farm\r\nprocedure and offer instructions and suggestions for the practical\r\nfarmer. The annual edition of these bulletins is over six and one half\r\nmillion copies. By law eighty per cent. of these are placed at the\r\ndisposal of the members of Congress, the remaining twenty per cent.\r\nbeing in the hands of the Secretary of Agriculture. Libraries will be\r\nplaced on the mailing list, or single copies will be sent on\r\napplication to a senator, representative or delegate, or to the\r\nsecretary of the department. An _Index to Farmers' Bulletins 1-250_ was\r\nissued as _Bulletin 8_ of the Division of Publications, Department of\r\nAgriculture; _Circular No. 4_ of this Division is a _Farmers' Bulletin\r\nSubject Index_, and contains a list of the subjects of the _Bulletins_\r\narranged alphabetically. It is revised at frequent intervals. The\r\nLibrary of Congress issues printed cards for the _Farmers' Bulletins_.\r\n\r\nThe _Yearbook_ of the Department of Agriculture is virtually an annual\r\nencyclopedia of popular, timely articles on special topics covering the\r\nyear's work of the Department and the year's progress in agriculture.\r\nThe law provides for an edition of 500,000 copies, but under the new\r\nsystem of public printing, the actual number issued is 300,000. The\r\nDepartment has 30,000 and the remainder is placed at the order of the\r\nmembers of Congress. Applications to either source will be filled, but\r\nrequests had better be sent to the congressmen first. Two indexes to\r\nthe _Yearbook_ have been prepared: _Bulletin 7_, Division of\r\nPublications covers the annual volumes for the period, 1894-1900, and\r\n_Bulletin 9_ of the same Division, the years 1901-1905. Catalog cards\r\nfor all the articles can be secured from the Library of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe Division of Publications, Department of Agriculture, issues\r\n_Circular No. 2_, _Publications for Free Distribution_, which gives the\r\ntitles of such publications. They are sent free as long as the edition\r\nlasts, application being made to the Secretary of Agriculture.\r\n_Circular No. 3_ is _Publications for Sale_. These can be purchased\r\nfrom the Superintendent of Documents, the remittances being sent by\r\npostal money orders, express orders, New York draft, or in currency,\r\nbut never in stamps. There is also a _Monthly List of Publications_\r\nissued by the Department of Agriculture, which will be sent to any\r\nlibrary free. Through these three lists a librarian can keep in touch\r\nwith the publications of the most active publishing department of the\r\ngovernment and secure the latest available information for the library\r\npatrons.\r\n\r\nThe _Annual Report_ of the American Historical Association is devoted\r\nto papers by historians of national fame, to reports of the Public\r\nArchives Commission, and to the publication of historical\r\nbibliographical enterprises. For the students of American history no\r\none set of government documents can be more valuable. The edition is\r\nrather limited, the law providing for 5,500 copies. As the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution has so many exchanges, these reports are best secured from\r\nthe quota allowed to Congressmen.\r\n\r\nThe International Bureau of American Republics is not essentially a\r\nUnited States government bureau, but one in which twenty-one of the\r\nrepublics of the Western Hemisphere have an interest. The _Monthly\r\nBulletin_ is printed in four languages--English, Spanish, Portuguese\r\nand French. It contains the latest information on the commerce, laws,\r\nnew enterprises and general development of each republic. It is\r\nessentially a magazine of Central and South American events. This\r\nBulletin cannot be obtained free, as the bureau sells nearly all its\r\npublications. The subscription price for the English edition is $2.00\r\nper year. A small library does not need the foreign edition.\r\nCommunications should be addressed to the Director of the Bureau.\r\n\r\nNo library can afford to be without the publications of the Bureau of\r\nthe Census. The volumes of the decennial censuses contain the\r\nstatistical records of the nation's growth and development. If the full\r\nset of reports is not wanted, by all means the _Abstract_ should be\r\nsecured, as it contains the summaries. The series of _Bulletins_ issued\r\nby the permanent bureau contains the recent statistics, estimates, and\r\nare the source for much of the data found in the annual newspaper\r\nalmanacs. These publications are supplied free of charge to libraries\r\nupon application to the Director of the Census or to members of\r\nCongress. The Department of Commerce and Labor has issued a _List of\r\nPublications_ ... _available for distribution_; the Bureau has also\r\nissued _Publications Tenth, Eleventh and Twelfth Censuses and Permanent\r\nBureau_. The publications no longer available are marked with an\r\nasterisk.\r\n\r\nThe _Annual Reports_ of the Civil Service Commission contain the data\r\non the historical and statistical growth of the classified government\r\nservice, the number and character of examinations, the appointments to\r\nservice, the rules covering civil service appointment and the legal\r\ndecisions of the Commission. The Commission has twenty thousand copies\r\nof its annual report for distribution, applications for it being made\r\ndirectly to the Commission. The _Manual of Examinations_ is issued\r\nJanuary 1st and July 1st of each year, and give the date, place,\r\ncharacter and scope of scheduled examinations. It will be found\r\nindispensable for those desiring to enter the government service. It\r\nwill be furnished gratuitously by the Commission.\r\n\r\nThe _Congressional Directory_ is issued in three editions for a long\r\nsession, and in two for a short one. It contains the essential facts\r\nnecessary for a valuable reference book on the government. There are\r\nbiographical sketches of each senator, representative and delegate in\r\nCongress; committee arrangements are given for all members; officials\r\nand attaches of both houses are listed; biographical sketches are given\r\nfor the heads of the executive departments; there is a roster of the\r\nchief officers in each department and in the consular and diplomatic\r\nservice; finally, there is a brief outline of the official duties of\r\neach department, bureau and division in the government. The number\r\nissued is determined by the Joint Committee on Printing, but inasmuch\r\nas the _Directory_ is issued as a Senate document, it can be secured by\r\napplication to a member in Congress. If not supplied in this way, it\r\ncan be purchased from the Superintendent of Documents. The last edition\r\nis the one to be secured.\r\n\r\nThe _Congressional Record_ is published daily when Congress is in\r\nsession and in a collected edition when the session is over. It is a\r\nverbatim report of all that takes place in Congress, and ought to be\r\nplaced with the daily papers in a library. An _Index_ is prepared every\r\ntwo weeks and one for the entire session. Besides the references to the\r\nbills, the index contains a history of each measure and the number of\r\neach committee report and document presented. Each senator has ninety\r\ncopies and each representative and delegate has sixty-two copies.\r\nLibrarians should make application to their congressmen for the\r\n_Record_ at the beginning of each session of Congress, as new mailing\r\nlists are made out at that time.\r\n\r\nThe _Annual Reports_ of the Bureau of Education are devoted to\r\nstatistics concerning the educational system of the United States.\r\nThere are also discussions and papers on important educational\r\nmovements in other countries. The law provides for an edition of 35,000\r\ncopies, 20,000 of which are distributed by the Bureau. The reports from\r\n1867 to 1898 are indexed in _A. L. A. Index_, 2d ed. Since 1906 much of\r\nthe descriptive material in the annual reports has been eliminated and\r\npublished as _Bulletins_. These contain many late monographs of\r\nimportance and the results of study of new problems in education.\r\nBulletin 2, 1908, is a _List of Publications ... 1867-1907_. The annual\r\nbibliography of education which has been issued for the past eight\r\nyears in the Educational Review is now printed as a _Bulletin_ of the\r\nBureau of Education.\r\n\r\nThe _Experiment Station Record_, a publication of the Office of\r\nExperiment Stations, gives a technical review of the current literature\r\nof agricultural investigation, not only in the United States, but also\r\nthroughout the whole world. It reviews books and annual reports of\r\ngovernments and the agricultural experiment stations in the various\r\nstates and about 1,600 periodicals in twelve or more languages. The\r\nOffice maintains a mailing list, and application for publications\r\nshould be directed to the Director. The _Record_ is also sold by the\r\nSuperintendent of Documents at $1.00 per volume, beginning with July,\r\n1909. Previous volumes are $1.50.\r\n\r\nThe _Annual Reports_ of the Interstate Commerce Commission cover both\r\nthe administrative and the quasi-judicial proceedings of the\r\nCommission. In its administrative features the report presents railroad\r\nstatistics, discusses the uniform methods of accounting, and summarizes\r\nthe results of enforcing the safety appliance laws, the hours of\r\nservice act and the accidents law. Important decisions made during the\r\nyear by the Commission and by United States Courts are reviewed. The\r\nreports are furnished gratuitously by the Commission to those who\r\napply. Another valuable serial is the report on the _Statistics of\r\nRailways in the United States_. It is prepared according to schedules,\r\nand covers the mileage, the amount of railway capital, the earnings and\r\nincome, the general expenditures and the accidents. This volume is also\r\ndistributed free by the Commission.\r\n\r\nThe Bureau of Labor issues three serials which ought to be found in\r\nevery library. The _Annual Reports_ contain the results of\r\ninvestigations which the Bureau has made on industrial and social\r\nsubjects. The _Special Reports_ are on particular subjects, and are\r\nprepared as requested by the President of the United States or by\r\neither house of Congress. The _Bulletin_ is issued bi-monthly, and\r\ncontains the latest information on subjects within the wide field of\r\nlabor and not included in the other reports. The _Annual Reports_ and\r\n_Bulletins_ up to 1898 are indexed in the _A. L. A. Index_, 2d ed. The\r\nBureau issued an _Index_ in 1902 which covers _Annual Reports_ 1-16,\r\n_Bulletins_ 1-39 and _Special Reports_ 1-9. Application for these\r\npublications are best made to the Bureau and handled from its mailing\r\nlist.\r\n\r\nThe most useful publication of the Library of Congress in a small\r\nlibrary is the series of bibliographies compiled in the Division of\r\nBibliography. They vary in size from approximately complete\r\nbibliographies to small reading lists on questions of current interest.\r\nInasmuch as they are based on the largest collection of library\r\nmaterials in the United States, the bibliographies give an idea of\r\nexisting references and sources which might not be suggested or even\r\nknown in smaller institutions. Through library loans and the judicious\r\nwriting for sources, the small library can supply liberal materials for\r\nstudy from these bibliographies. As to the distribution of these\r\npublications, the Library of Congress makes this statement: \"With\r\ncertain exceptions, the publications are not distributed gratis, except\r\nto institutions with which the library regularly exchanges.\" At any\r\nevent, they can be purchased from the Superintendent of Documents for\r\nfrom ten to fifteen cents. The complete list of these bibliographies is\r\npublished in the _List of Publications Issued Since 1897_ (by the\r\nLibrary of Congress).\r\n\r\nThe _Daily Consular and Trade Reports_ are issued from the Bureau of\r\nManufactures. These are a collection of reports made by United States\r\nconsuls in all parts of the world on matters of commercial and current\r\nimportance, such as new inventions, crops, market possibilities and\r\ncommercial relations in general. The Bureau will add a library to its\r\nmailing list upon application.\r\n\r\nThe Bureau of Statistics of the Department of Commerce and Labor issue\r\ntwo serials which are of use in small libraries. The _Monthly Summary\r\nof Commerce and Finance_ is the leading statistical publication of the\r\ngovernment. It gives a very complete and detailed statistical account\r\nof the foreign commerce of the United States, the internal commerce and\r\nthe commerce with the non-contiguous possessions. The _Statistical\r\nAbstract_ covers, in summarized form, most of the important subjects in\r\nthe wide field of government activity, and easily ranks as \"the most\r\nuseful summary of statistics relating to our country that is printed.\"\r\nThe edition is limited to twelve thousand copies--three thousand to the\r\nSenate, six thousand to the House, and the remainder to the Bureau.\r\nApplication for both serials can be made directly to the Bureau, and\r\nespecially for the _Monthly Summary_.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the librarian that intends to be alive to his\r\nopportunity with government documents will get the _Annual Reports_ of\r\nthe Superintendent of Documents for 1907 and 1908 and commit them to\r\nheart. They contain the best explanation of the present plan of\r\ndistribution and other problems with these publications that has been\r\nwritten. The library should receive the series of _Price Lists_ and\r\n_Leaflets_ now being issued by the Documents Office. The one is\r\nvirtually a bibliography of some important subjects which the documents\r\ncover; the other is a description of some one document or some class of\r\nmore than passing interest. Both show what can be purchased and the\r\nprice of the publication. If the library has not received copies of\r\n_Free Lists Nos. 1 to 3_, they should be sent for. They contain a list\r\nof the documents which are offered free of all charge to libraries.\r\nMany rare and useful publications can be secured in this way. Finally,\r\nif possible, subscribe for the _Monthly Catalog of Public Documents_,\r\nwhich keeps the reading public informed as to what is now being\r\npublished by the government, how and where the publications can be\r\nobtained and the purchase price.",
