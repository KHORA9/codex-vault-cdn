They revealed for the first time to the world\r\nthe nature of the United States' imperialistic venture in Haiti. While,\r\nowing to the censorship, the full story of this fundamental departure\r\nfrom American traditions has not yet been told, it appears at the time\r\nof this writing, October, 1920, that \"pitiless publicity\" for our\r\nsandbagging of a friendly and inoffensive neighbor has been achieved.\r\nThe report of Major-General George Barnett, commandant of the Marine\r\nCorps during the first four years of the Haitian occupation, just\r\nissued, strikingly confirms the facts set forth by _The Nation_ and\r\nrefutes the denials of administration officials and their newspaper\r\napologists. It is in the hope that by spreading broadly the truth about\r\nwhat has happened in Haiti under five years of American occupation _The\r\nNation_ may further contribute toward removing a dark blot from the\r\nAmerican escutcheon, that this pamphlet is issued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSelf-Determining Haiti\r\n\r\nBy JAMES WELDON JOHNSON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE AMERICAN OCCUPATION\r\n\r\n\r\nTo know the reasons for the present political situation in Haiti, to\r\nunderstand why the United States landed and has for five years\r\nmaintained military forces in that country, why some three thousand\r\nHaitian men, women, and children have been shot down by American rifles\r\nand machine guns, it is necessary, among other things, to know that the\r\nNational City Bank of New York is very much interested in Haiti. It is\r\nnecessary to know that the National City Bank controls the National Bank\r\nof Haiti and is the depository for all of the Haitian national funds\r\nthat are being collected by American officials, and that Mr. R. L.\r\nFarnham, vice-president of the National City Bank, is virtually the\r\nrepresentative of the State Department in matters relating to the island\r\nrepublic. Most Americans have the opinion--if they have any opinion at\r\nall on the subject--that the United States was forced, on purely humane\r\ngrounds, to intervene in the black republic because of the tragic coup\r\nd'etat which resulted in the overthrow and death of President Vilbrun\r\nGuillaume Sam and the execution of the political prisoners confined at\r\nPort-au-Prince, July 27-28, 1915; and that this government has been\r\ncompelled to keep a military force in Haiti since that time to pacify\r\nthe country and maintain order.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that for nearly a year before forcible intervention on the\r\npart of the United States this government was seeking to compel Haiti to\r\nsubmit to \"peaceable\" intervention. Toward the close of 1914 the United\r\nStates notified the government of Haiti that it was disposed to\r\nrecognize the newly-elected president, Theodore Davilmar, as soon as a\r\nHaitian commission would sign at Washington \"satisfactory protocols\"\r\nrelative to a convention with the United States on the model of the\r\nDominican-American Convention. On December 15, 1914, the Haitian\r\ngovernment, through its Secretary of Foreign Affairs, replied: \"The\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Haiti would consider itself lax in its\r\nduty to the United States and to itself if it allowed the least doubt\r\nto exist of its irrevocable intention not to accept any control of the\r\nadministration of Haitian affairs by a foreign Power.\" On December 19,\r\nthe United States, through its legation at Port-au-Prince, replied, that\r\nin expressing its willingness to do in Haiti what had been done in Santo\r\nDomingo it \"was actuated entirely by a disinterested desire to give\r\nassistance.\"\r\n\r\nTwo months later, the Theodore government was overthrown by a revolution\r\nand Vilbrun Guillaume was elected president. Immediately afterwards\r\nthere arrived at Port-au-Prince an American commission from\r\nWashington--the Ford mission. The commissioners were received at the\r\nNational Palace and attempted to take up the discussion of the\r\nconvention that had been broken off in December, 1914. However, they\r\nlacked full powers and no negotiations were entered into. After several\r\ndays, the Ford mission sailed for the United States. But soon after, in\r\nMay, the United States sent to Haiti Mr. Paul Fuller, Jr., with the\r\ntitle Envoy Extraordinary, on a special mission to apprise the Haitian\r\ngovernment that the Guillaume administration would not be recognized by\r\nthe American government unless Haiti accepted and signed the project of\r\na convention which he was authorized to present. After examining the\r\nproject the Haitian government submitted to the American commission a\r\ncounter-project, formulating the conditions under which it would be\r\npossible to accept the assistance of the United States. To this\r\ncounter-project Mr. Fuller proposed certain modifications, some of which\r\nwere accepted by the Haitian government. On June 5, 1915, Mr. Fuller\r\nacknowledged the receipt of the Haitian communication regarding these\r\nmodifications, and sailed from Port-au-Prince.\r\n\r\nBefore any further discussion of the Fuller project between the two\r\ngovernments, political incidents in Haiti led rapidly to the events of\r\nJuly, 27 and 28. On July 27 President Guillaume fled to the French\r\nLegation, and on the same day took place a massacre of the political\r\nprisoners in the prison at Port-au-Prince. On the morning of July 28\r\nPresident Guillaume was forcibly taken from French Legation and killed.\r\nOn the afternoon of July 28 an American man-of-war dropped anchor in the\r\nharbor of Port-au-Prince and landed American forces. It should be borne\r\nin mind that through all of this the life of not a single American\r\ncitizen had been taken or jeopardized.\r\n\r\nThe overthrow of Guillaume and its attending consequences did not\r\nconstitute the cause of American intervention in Haiti, but merely\r\nfurnished the awaited opportunity. Since July 28, 1915, American\r\nmilitary forces have been in control of Haiti. These forces have been\r\nincreased until there are now somewhere near three thousand Americans\r\nunder arms in the republic. From the very first, the attitude of the\r\nOccupation has been that it was dealing with a conquered territory.\r\nHaitian forces were disarmed, military posts and barracks were occupied,\r\nand the National Palace was taken as headquarters for the Occupation.\r\nAfter selecting a new and acceptable president for the country, steps\r\nwere at once taken to compel the Haitian government to sign a convention\r\nin which it virtually foreswore its independence. This was accomplished\r\nby September 16, 1915; and although the terms of this convention\r\nprovided for the administration of the Haitian customs by American\r\ncivilian officials, all the principal custom houses of the country had\r\nbeen seized by military force and placed in charge of American Marine\r\nofficers before the end of August. The disposition of the funds\r\ncollected in duties from the time of the military seizure of the custom\r\nhouses to the time of their administration by civilian officials is\r\nstill a question concerning which the established censorship in Haiti\r\nallows no discussion.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note the wide difference between the convention\r\nwhich Haiti was forced to sign and the convention which was in course of\r\ndiplomatic negotiation at the moment of intervention. The Fuller\r\nconvention asked little of Haiti and gave something, the Occupation\r\nconvention demands everything of Haiti and gives nothing. The Occupation\r\nconvention is really the same convention which the Haitian government\r\nperemptorily refused to discuss in December, 1914, except that in\r\naddition to American control of Haitian finances it also provides for\r\nAmerican control of the Haitian military forces. The Fuller convention\r\ncontained neither of these provisions. When the United States found\r\nitself in a position to take what it had not even dared to ask, it used\r\nbrute force and took it. But even a convention which practically\r\ndeprived Haiti of its independence was found not wholly adequate for\r\nthe accomplishment of all that was contemplated. The Haitian\r\nconstitution still offered some embarrassments, so it was decided that\r\nHaiti must have a new constitution. It was drafted and presented to the\r\nHaitian assembly for adoption. The assembly balked--chiefly at the\r\narticle in the proposed document removing the constitutional disability\r\nwhich prevented aliens from owning land in Haiti. Haiti had long\r\nconsidered the denial of this right to aliens as her main bulwark\r\nagainst overwhelming economic exploitation; and it must be admitted that\r\nshe had better reasons than the several states of the United States that\r\nhave similar provisions.\r\n\r\nThe balking of the assembly resulted in its being dissolved by actual\r\nmilitary force and the locking of doors of the Chamber. There has been\r\nno Haitian legislative body since. The desired constitution was\r\nsubmitted to a plebiscite by a decree of the President, although such a\r\nmethod of constitutional revision was clearly unconstitutional. Under\r\nthe circumstances of the Occupation the plebiscite was, of course,\r\nalmost unanimous for the desired change, and the new constitution was\r\npromulgated on June 18, 1918. Thus Haiti was given a new constitution by\r\na flagrantly unconstitutional method. The new document contains several\r\nfundamental changes and includes a \"Special Article\" which declares:\r\n\r\n     All the acts of the Government of the United States during its\r\n     military Occupation in Haiti are ratified and confirmed.\r\n\r\n     No Haitian shall be liable to civil or criminal prosecution for\r\n     any act done by order of the Occupation or under its authority.\r\n\r\n     The acts of the courts martial of the Occupation, without,\r\n     however, infringing on the right to pardon, shall not be\r\n     subject to revision.\r\n\r\n     The acts of the Executive Power (the President) up to the\r\n     promulgation of the present constitution are likewise ratified\r\n     and confirmed.\r\n\r\nThe above is the chronological order of the principal steps by which the\r\nindependence of a neighboring republic has been taken away, the people\r\nplaced under foreign military domination from which they have no appeal,\r\nand exposed to foreign economic exploitation against which they are\r\ndefenseless. All of this has been done in the name of the Government of\r\nthe United States; however, without any act by Congress and without any\r\nknowledge of the American people.\r\n\r\nThe law by which Haiti is ruled today is martial law dispensed by\r\nAmericans. There is a form of Haitian civil government, but it is\r\nentirely dominated by the military Occupation. President Dartiguenave,\r\nbitterly rebellious at heart as is every good Haitian, confessed to me\r\nthe powerlessness of himself and his cabinet. He told me that the\r\nAmerican authorities give no heed to recommendations made by him or his\r\nofficers; that they would not even discuss matters about which the\r\nHaitian officials have superior knowledge. The provisions of both the\r\nold and the new constitutions are ignored in that there is no Haitian\r\nlegislative body, and there has been none since the dissolution of the\r\nAssembly in April, 1916. In its stead there is a Council of State\r\ncomposed of twenty-one members appointed by the president, which\r\nfunctions effectively only when carrying out the will of the Occupation.\r\nIndeed the Occupation often overrides the civil courts. A prisoner\r\nbrought before the proper court, exonerated, and discharged, is,\r\nnevertheless, frequently held by the military. All government funds are\r\ncollected by the Occupation and are dispensed at its will and pleasure.\r\nThe greater part of these funds is expended for the maintenance of the\r\nmilitary forces. There is the strictest censorship of the press. No\r\nHaitian newspaper is allowed to publish anything in criticism of the\r\nOccupation or the Haitian government. Each newspaper in Haiti received\r\nan order to that effect from the Occupation, _and the same order carried\r\nthe injunction not to print the order_. Nothing that might reflect upon\r\nthe Occupation administration in Haiti is allowed to reach the\r\nnewspapers of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Haitian people justly complain that not only is the convention\r\ninimical to the best interests of their country, but that the\r\nconvention, such as it is, is not being carried out in accordance with\r\nthe letter, nor in accordance with the spirit in which they were led to\r\nbelieve it would be carried out. Except one, all of the obligations in\r\nthe convention which the United States undertakes in favor of Haiti are\r\ncontained in the first article of that document, the other fourteen\r\narticles being made up substantially of obligations to the United States\r\nassumed by Haiti. But nowhere in those fourteen articles is there\r\nanything to indicate that Haiti would be subjected to military\r\ndomination. In Article I the United States promises to \"aid the Haitian\r\ngovernment in the proper and efficient development of its agricultural,\r\nmineral, and commercial resources and in the establishment of the\r\nfinances of Haiti on a firm and solid basis.\" And the whole convention\r\nand, especially, the protestations of the United States before the\r\nsigning of the instrument can be construed only to mean that that aid\r\nwould be extended through the supervision of civilian officials.\r\n\r\nThe one promise of the United States to Haiti not contained in the first\r\narticle of the convention is that clause of Article XIV which says,\r\n\"and, should the necessity occur, the United States will lend an\r\nefficient aid for the preservation of Haitian independence and the\r\nmaintenance of a government adequate for the protection of life,\r\nproperty, and individual liberty.\" It is the extreme of irony that this\r\nclause which the Haitians had a right to interpret as a guarantee to\r\nthem against foreign invasion should first of all be invoked against the\r\nHaitian people themselves, and offer the only peg on which any pretense\r\nto a right of military domination can be hung.\r\n\r\nThere are several distinct forces--financial, military, bureaucratic--at\r\nwork in Haiti which, tending to aggravate the conditions they themselves\r\nhave created, are largely self-perpetuating. The most sinister of these,\r\nthe financial engulfment of Haiti by the National City Bank of New York,\r\nalready alluded to, will be discussed in detail in a subsequent article.\r\nThe military Occupation has made and continues to make military\r\nOccupation necessary. The justification given is that it is necessary\r\nfor the pacification of the country. Pacification would never have been\r\nnecessary had not American policies been filled with so many stupid and\r\nbrutal blunders; and it will never be effective so long as\r\n\"pacification\" means merely the hunting of ragged Haitians in the hills\r\nwith machine guns.\r\n\r\nThen there is the force which the several hundred American civilian\r\nplace-holders constitute. They have found in Haiti the veritable\r\npromised land of \"jobs for deserving democrats\" and naturally do not\r\nwish to see the present status discontinued. Most of these deserving\r\ndemocrats are Southerners. The head of the customs service of Haiti was\r\na clerk of one of the parishes of Louisiana. Second in charge of the\r\ncustoms service of Haiti is a man who was Deputy Collector of Customs at\r\nPascagoula, Mississippi [population, 3,379, 1910 Census]. The\r\nSuperintendent of Public Instruction was a school teacher in\r\nLouisiana--a State which has not good schools even for white children;\r\nthe financial advisor, Mr. McIlhenny, is also from Louisiana.\r\n\r\nMany of the Occupation officers are in the same category with the\r\ncivilian place-holders. These men have taken their wives and families to\r\nHaiti. Those at Port-au-Prince live in beautiful villas. Families that\r\ncould not keep a hired girl in the United States have a half-dozen\r\nservants. They ride in automobiles--not their own. Every American head\r\nof a department in Haiti has an automobile furnished at the expense of\r\nthe Haitian Government, whereas members of the Haitian cabinet, who are\r\ntheoretically above them, have no such convenience or luxury. While I\r\nwas there, the President himself was obliged to borrow an automobile\r\nfrom the Occupation for a trip through the interior. The Louisiana\r\nschool-teacher Superintendent of Instruction has an automobile furnished\r\nat government expense, whereas the Haitian Minister of Public\r\nInstruction, his supposed superior officer, has none. These automobiles\r\nseem to be chiefly employed in giving the women and children an airing\r\neach afternoon. It must be amusing, when it is not maddening to the\r\nHaitians, to see with what disdainful air these people look upon them as\r\nthey ride by.\r\n\r\nThe platform adopted by the Democratic party at San Francisco said of\r\nthe Wilson policy in Mexico:\r\n\r\n     The Administration, remembering always that Mexico is an\r\n     independent nation and that permanent stability in her\r\n     government and her institutions could come only from the\r\n     consent of her own people to a government of her own making,\r\n     has been unwilling either to profit by the misfortunes of the\r\n     people of Mexico or to enfeeble their future by imposing from\r\n     the outside a rule upon their temporarily distracted councils.\r\n\r\nHaiti has never been so distracted in its councils as Mexico. And even\r\nin its moments of greatest distraction it never slaughtered an American\r\ncitizen, it never molested an American woman, it never injured a\r\ndollar's worth of American property. And yet, the Administration whose\r\nlofty purpose was proclaimed as above--with less justification than\r\nAustria's invasion of Serbia, or Germany's rape of Belgium, without\r\nwarrant other than the doctrine that \"might makes right,\" has conquered\r\nHaiti. It has done this through the very period when, in the words of\r\nits chief spokesman, our sons were laying down their lives overseas \"for\r\ndemocracy, for the rights of those who submit to authority to have a\r\nvoice in their own government, for the rights and liberties of small\r\nnations.\" By command of the author of \"pitiless publicity\" and\r\noriginator of \"open covenants openly arrived at,\" it has enforced by the\r\nbayonet a covenant whose secret has been well guarded by a rigid\r\ncensorship from the American nation, and kept a people enslaved by the\r\nmilitary tyranny which it was his avowed purpose to destroy throughout\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n_From The Nation of August 25, 1920._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. WHAT THE UNITED STATES HAS ACCOMPLISHED\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the truth about the conquest of Haiti--the slaughter of three\r\nthousand and practically unarmed Haitians, with the incidentally\r\nneedless death of a score of American boys--begins to filter through the\r\nrigid Administration censorship to the American people, the apologists\r\nwill become active. Their justification of what has been done will be\r\ngrouped under two heads: one, the necessity, and two, the results. Under\r\nthe first, much stress will be laid upon the \"anarchy\" which existed in\r\nHaiti, upon the backwardness of the Haitians and their absolute\r\nunfitness to govern themselves. The pretext which caused the\r\nintervention was taken up in the first article of this series. The\r\ncharacteristics, alleged and real, of the Haitian people will be taken\r\nup in a subsequent article. Now as to results: The apologists will\r\nattempt to show that material improvements in Haiti justify American\r\nintervention. Let us see what they are.\r\n\r\nDiligent inquiry reveals just three: The building of the road from\r\nPort-au-Prince to Cape Haitien; the enforcement of certain sanitary\r\nregulations in the larger cities; and the improvement of the public\r\nhospital at Port-au-Prince. The enforcement of certain sanitary\r\nregulations is not so important as it may sound, for even under\r\nexclusive native rule, Haiti has been a remarkably healthy country and\r\nhad never suffered from such epidemics as used to sweep Cuba and the\r\nPanama Canal region. The regulations, moreover, were of a purely minor\r\ncharacter--the sort that might be issued by a board of health in any\r\nAmerican city or town--and were in no wise fundamental, because there\r\nwas no need. The same applies to the improvement of the hospital, long\r\nbefore the American Occupation, an effectively conducted institution but\r\nwhich, it is only fair to say, benefited considerably by the regulations\r\nand more up-to-date methods of American army surgeons--the best in the\r\nworld. Neither of these accomplishments, however, creditable as they\r\nare, can well be put forward as a justification for military domination.\r\nThe building of the great highway from Port-au-Prince to Cape Haitien is\r\na monumental piece of work, but it is doubtful whether the object in\r\nbuilding it was to supply the Haitians with a great highway or to\r\nconstruct a military road which would facilitate the transportation of\r\ntroops and supplies from one end of the island to the other. And this\r\nrepresents the sum total of the constructive accomplishment after five\r\nyears of American Occupation.\r\n\r\nNow, the highway, while doubtless the most important achievement of the\r\nthree, involved the most brutal of all the blunders of the Occupation.\r\nThe work was in charge of an officer of Marines who stands out even in\r\nthat organization for his \"treat 'em rough\" methods. He discovered the\r\nobsolete Haitian _corvee_ and decided to enforce it with the most modern\r\nMarine efficiency. The _corvee_, or road law, in Haiti provided that\r\neach citizen should work a certain number of days on the public roads to\r\nkeep them in condition, or pay a certain sum of money. In the days when\r\nthis law was in force the Haitian government never required the men to\r\nwork the roads except in their respective communities, and the number of\r\ndays was usually limited to three a year. But the Occupation seized men\r\nwherever it could find them, and no able-bodied Haitian was safe from\r\nsuch raids, which most closely resembled the African slave raids of past\r\ncenturies. And slavery it was--though temporary. By day or by night,\r\nfrom the bosom of their families, from their little farms or while\r\ntrudging peacefully on the country roads, Haitians were seized and\r\nforcibly taken to toil for months in far sections of the country. Those\r\nwho protested or resisted were beaten into submission. At night, after\r\nlong hours of unremitting labor under armed taskmasters, who swiftly\r\ndiscouraged any slackening of effort with boot or rifle butt, the\r\nvictims were herded in compounds. Those attempting to escape were shot.\r\nTheir terror-stricken families meanwhile were often in total ignorance\r\nof the fate of their husbands, fathers, brothers.\r\n\r\nIt is chiefly out of these methods that arose the need for\r\n\"pacification.\" Many men of the rural districts became panic-stricken\r\nand fled to the hills and mountains. Others rebelled and did likewise,\r\npreferring death to slavery. These refugees largely make up the \"caco\"\r\nforces, to hunt down which has become the duty and the sport of American\r\nMarines, who were privileged to shoot a \"caco\" on sight. If anyone\r\ndoubts that \"caco\" hunting is the sport of American Marines in Haiti,\r\nlet him learn the facts about the death of Charlemagne. Charlemagne\r\nPeralte was a Haitian of education and culture and of great influence in\r\nhis district. He was tried by an American courtmartial on the charge of\r\naiding \"cacos.\" He was sentenced, not to prison, however, but to five\r\nyears of hard labor on the roads, and was forced to work in convict garb\r\non the streets of Cape Haitien. He made his escape and put himself at\r\nthe head of several hundred followers in a valiant though hopeless\r\nattempt to free Haiti. The America of the Revolution, indeed the America\r\nof the Civil War, would have regarded Charlemagne not as a criminal but\r\na patriot. He met his death not in open fight, not in an attempt at his\r\ncapture, but through a dastard deed. While standing over his camp fire,\r\nhe was shot in cold blood by an American Marine officer who stood\r\nconcealed by the darkness, and who had reached the camp through bribery\r\nand trickery. This deed, which was nothing short of assassination, has\r\nbeen heralded as an example of American heroism. Of this deed, Harry\r\nFranck, writing in the June Century of \"The Death of Charlemagne,\" says:\r\n\"Indeed it is fit to rank with any of the stirring warrior tales with\r\nwhich history is seasoned from the days of the Greeks down to the recent\r\nworld war.\" America should read \"The Death of Charlemagne\" which\r\nattempts to glorify a black smirch on American arms and tradition.\r\n\r\nThere is a reason why the methods employed in road building affected the\r\nHaitian country folk in a way in which it might not have affected the\r\npeople of any other Latin-American country. Not since the independence\r\nof the country has there been any such thing as a peon in Haiti. The\r\nrevolution by which Haiti gained her independence was not merely a\r\npolitical revolution, it was also a social revolution. Among the many\r\nradical changes wrought was that of cutting up the large slave estates\r\ninto small parcels and allotting them among former slaves. And so it was\r\nthat every Haitian in the rural districts lived on his own plot of land,\r\na plot on which his family has lived for perhaps more than a hundred\r\nyears. No matter how small or how large that plot is, and whether he\r\nraises much or little on it, it is his and he is an independent farmer.\r\n\r\nThe completed highway, moreover, continued to be a barb in the Haitian\r\nwound. Automobiles on this road, running without any speed limit, are a\r\nconstant inconvenience or danger to the natives carrying their market\r\nproduce to town on their heads or loaded on the backs of animals. I have\r\nseen these people scramble in terror often up the side or down the\r\ndeclivity of the mountain for places of safety for themselves and their\r\nanimals as the machines snorted by. I have seen a market woman's horse\r\ntake flight and scatter the produce loaded on his back all over the road\r\nfor several hundred yards. I have heard an American commercial traveler\r\nlaughingly tell how on the trip from Cape Haitien to Port-au-Prince the\r\nautomobile he was in killed a donkey and two pigs. It had not occurred\r\nto him that the donkey might be the chief capital of the small Haitian\r\nfarmer and that the loss of it might entirely bankrupt him. It is all\r\nvery humorous, of course, unless you happen to be the Haitian\r\npedestrian.\r\n\r\nThe majority of visitors on arriving at Port-au-Prince and noticing the\r\nwell-paved, well-kept streets, will at once jump to the conclusion that\r\nthis work was done by the American Occupation. The Occupation goes to no\r\ntrouble to refute this conclusion, and in fact it will by implication\r\ncorroborate it. If one should exclaim, \"Why, I am surprised to see what\r\na well-paved city Port-au-Prince is!\" he would be almost certain to\r\nreceive the answer, \"Yes, but you should have seen it before the\r\nOccupation.\" The implication here is that Port-au-Prince was a mudhole\r\nand that the Occupation is responsible for its clean and well-paved\r\nstreets. It is true that at the time of the intervention, five years\r\nago, there were only one or two paved streets in the Haitian capital,\r\nbut the contracts for paving the entire city had been let by the Haitian\r\nGovernment, and the work had already been begun. This work was completed\r\nduring the Occupation, _but the Occupation did not pave, and had nothing\r\nto do with the paving of a single street in Port-au-Prince_.\r\n\r\nOne accomplishment I did expect to find--that the American Occupation,\r\nin its five years of absolute rule, had developed and improved the\r\nHaitian system of public education. The United States has made some\r\nefforts in this direction in other countries where it has taken control.\r\nIn Porto Rico, Cuba, and the Philippines, the attempt, at least, was\r\nmade to establish modern school systems. Selected youths from these\r\ncountries were taken and sent to the United States for training in order\r\nthat they might return and be better teachers, and American teachers\r\nwere sent to those islands in exchange. The American Occupation in Haiti\r\nhas not advanced public education a single step. No new buildings have\r\nbeen erected. Not a single Haitian youth has been sent to the United\r\nStates for training as a teacher, nor has a single American teacher,\r\nwhite or colored, been sent to Haiti. According to the general budget of\r\nHaiti, 1919-1920, there are teachers in the rural schools receiving as\r\nlittle as six dollars a month. Some of these teachers may not be worth\r\nmore than six dollars a month. But after five years of American rule,\r\nthere ought not to be a single teacher in the country who is not worth\r\nmore than that paltry sum.\r\n\r\nAnother source of discontent is the Gendarmerie. When the Occupation\r\ntook possession of the island, it disarmed all Haitians, including the\r\nvarious local police forces. To remedy this situation the Convention\r\n(Article X), provided that there should be created,--\r\n\r\n     without delay, an efficient constabulary, urban and rural,\r\n     composed of native Haitians. This constabulary shall be\r\n     organized and officered by Americans, appointed by the\r\n     President of Haiti upon nomination by the President of the\r\n     United States.... These officers shall be replaced by Haitians\r\n     as they, by examination conducted under direction of a board to\r\n     be selected by the Senior American Officer of this constabulary\r\n     in the presence of a representative of the Haitian Government,\r\n     are found to be qualified to assume such duties.\r\n\r\nDuring the first months of the Occupation officers of the Haitian\r\nGendarmerie were commissioned officers of the marines, but the war took\r\nall these officers to Europe. Five years have passed and the\r\nconstabulary is still officered entirely by marines, but almost without\r\nexception they are ex-privates or non-commissioned officers of the\r\nUnited States Marine Corps commissioned in the gendarmerie. Many of\r\nthese men are rough, uncouth, and uneducated, and a great number from\r\nthe South, are violently steeped in color prejudice. They direct all\r\npolicing of city and town. It falls to them, ignorant of Haitian ways\r\nand language, to enforce every minor police regulation. Needless to say,\r\nthis is a grave source of continued irritation. Where the genial\r\nAmerican \"cop\" could, with a wave of his hand or club, convey the full\r\nmajesty of the law to the small boy transgressor or to some equally\r\ninnocuous offender, the strong-arm tactics for which the marines are\r\nfamous, are apt to be promptly evoked. The pledge in the Convention that\r\n\"these officers be replaced by Haitians\" who could qualify, has, like\r\nother pledges, become a mere scrap of paper. Graduates of the famous\r\nFrench military academy of St. Cyr, men who have actually qualified for\r\ncommissions in the French army, are denied the opportunity to fill even\r\na lesser commission in the Haitian Gendarmerie, although such men, in\r\naddition to their pre-eminent qualifications of training, would, because\r\nof their understanding of local conditions and their complete\r\nfamiliarity with the ways of their own country, make ideal guardians of\r\nthe peace.\r\n\r\nThe American Occupation of Haiti is not only guilty of sins of omission,\r\nit is guilty of sins of commission in addition to those committed in the\r\nbuilding of the great road across the island. Brutalities and atrocities\r\non the part of American marines have occurred with sufficient frequency\r\nto be the cause of deep resentment and terror. Marines talk freely of\r\nwhat they \"did\" to some Haitians in the outlying districts. Familiar\r\nmethods of torture to make captives reveal what they often do not know\r\nare nonchalantly discussed. Just before I left Port-au-Prince an\r\nAmerican Marine had caught a Haitian boy stealing sugar off the wharf\r\nand instead of arresting him he battered his brains out with the butt of\r\nhis rifle. I learned from the lips of American Marines themselves of a\r\nnumber of cases of rape of Haitian women by marines. I often sat at\r\ntables in the hotels and cafes in company with marine officers and they\r\ntalked before me without restraint. I remember the description of a\r\n\"caco\" hunt by one of them; he told how they finally came upon a crowd\r\nof natives engaged in the popular pastime of cock-fighting and how they\r\n\"let them have it\" with machine guns and rifle fire. I heard another, a\r\ncaptain of marines, relate how he at a fire in Port-au-Prince ordered a\r\n\"rather dressed up Haitian,\" standing on the sidewalk, to \"get in there\"\r\nand take a hand at the pumps. It appeared that the Haitian merely\r\nshrugged his shoulders. The captain of marines then laughingly said: \"I\r\nhad on a pretty heavy pair of boots and I let him have a kick that\r\nlanded him in the middle of the street. Someone ran up and told me that\r\nthe man was an ex-member of the Haitian Assembly.\" The fact that the man\r\nhad been a member of the Haitian Assembly made the whole incident more\r\nlaughable to the captain of marines.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most serious aspect of American brutality in Haiti is not to\r\nbe found in individual cases of cruelty, numerous and inexcusable though\r\nthey are, but rather in the American attitude, well illustrated by the\r\ndiagnosis of an American officer discussing the situation and its\r\ndifficulty: \"The trouble with this whole business is that some of these\r\npeople with a little money and education think they are as good as we\r\nare,\" and this is the keynote of the attitude of every American to every\r\nHaitian. Americans have carried American hatred to Haiti. They have\r\nplanted the feeling of caste and color prejudice where it never before\r\nexisted.\r\n\r\nAnd such are the \"accomplishments\" of the United States in Haiti. The\r\nOccupation has not only failed to achieve anything worth while, but has\r\nmade it impossible to do so because of the distrust and bitterness that\r\nit has engendered in the Haitian people. Through the present\r\ninstrumentalities no matter how earnestly the United States may desire\r\nto be fair to Haiti and make intervention a success, it will not\r\nsucceed. An entirely new deal is necessary. This Government forced the\r\nHaitian leaders to accept the promise of American aid and American\r\nsupervision. With that American aid the Haitian Government defaulted its\r\nexternal and internal debt, an obligation, which under self-government\r\nthe Haitians had scrupulously observed. And American supervision turned\r\nout to be a military tyranny supporting a program of economic\r\nexploitation. The United States had an opportunity to gain the\r\nconfidence of the Haitian people. That opportunity has been destroyed.\r\nWhen American troops first landed, although the Haitian people were\r\noutraged, there was a feeling nevertheless which might well have\r\ndeveloped into cooperation. There were those who had hopes that the\r\nUnited States, guided by its traditional policy of nearly a century and\r\na half, pursuing its fine stand in Cuba, under McKinley, Roosevelt, and\r\nTaft, would extend aid that would be mutually beneficial to both\r\ncountries. Those Haitians who indulged this hope are disappointed and\r\nbitter. Those members of the Haitian Assembly who, while acting under\r\ncoercion were nevertheless hopeful of American promises, incurred\r\nunpopularity by voting for the Convention, are today bitterly\r\ndisappointed and utterly disillusioned.\r\n\r\nIf the United States should leave Haiti today, it would leave more than\r\na thousand widows and orphans of its own making, more banditry than has\r\nexisted for a century, resentment, hatred and despair in the heart of a\r\nwhole people, to say nothing of the irreparable injury to its own\r\ntradition as the defender of the rights of man.\r\n\r\n_From The Nation of September 4, 1920._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. GOVERNMENT OF, BY, AND FOR THE NATIONAL CITY BANK\r\n\r\n\r\nFormer articles of this series described the Military Occupation of\r\nHaiti and the crowd of civilian place holders as among the forces at\r\nwork in Haiti to maintain the present status in that country. But more\r\npowerful though less obvious, and more sinister, because of its deep and\r\nvaried radications, is the force exercised by the National City Bank of\r\nNew York. It seeks more than the mere maintenance of the present status\r\nin Haiti; it is constantly working to bring about a condition more\r\nsuitable and profitable to itself. Behind the Occupation, working\r\nconjointly with the Department of State, stands this great banking\r\ninstitution of New York and elsewhere. The financial potentates allied\r\nwith it are the ones who will profit by the control of Haiti. The\r\nUnited States Marine Corps and the various office-holding \"deserving\r\nDemocrats,\" who help maintain the status quo there, are in reality\r\nworking for great financial interests in this country, although Uncle\r\nSam and Haiti pay their salaries.\r\n\r\nMr. Roger L. Farnham, vice-president of the National City Bank, was\r\neffectively instrumental in bringing about American intervention in\r\nHaiti. With the administration at Washington, the word of Mr. Farnham\r\nsupersedes that of anybody else on the island. While Mr.\r\nBailly-Blanchard, with the title of minister, is its representative in\r\nname, Mr. Farnham is its representative in fact. His goings and comings\r\nare aboard vessels of the United States Navy. His bank, the National\r\nCity, has been in charge of the Banque Nationale d'Haiti throughout the\r\nOccupation.[1] Only a few weeks ago he was appointed receiver of the\r\nNational Railroad of Haiti, controlling practically the entire railway\r\nsystem in the island with valuable territorial concessions in all\r\nparts.[2] The $5,000,000 sugar plant at Port-au-Prince, it is commonly\r\nreported, is about to fall into his hands.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The National City Bank originally (about 1911) purchased\r\n2,000 shares of the stock of the Banque Nationale d'Haiti. After the\r\nOccupation it purchased 6,000 additional shares in the hands of three\r\nNew York banking firms. Since then it has been negotiating for the\r\ncomplete control of the stock, the balance of which is held in France.\r\nThe contract for this transfer of the Bank and the granting of a new\r\ncharter under the laws of Haiti were agreed upon and signed at\r\nWashington last February. But the delay in completing these arrangements\r\nis caused by the impasse between the State Department and the National\r\nCity Bank, on the one hand, and the Haitian Government on the other, due\r\nto the fact that the State Department and the National City Bank\r\ninsisted upon including in the contract a clause prohibiting the\r\nimportation and exportation of foreign money into Haiti subject only to\r\nthe control of the financial adviser. To this new power the Haitian\r\nGovernment refuses to consent.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Originally, Mr. James P. McDonald secured from the Haitian\r\nGovernment the concession to build the railroads under the charter of\r\nthe National Railways of Haiti. He arranged with W. R. Grace & Company\r\nto finance the concession. Grace and Company formed a syndicate under\r\nthe aegis of the National City Bank which issued $2,500,000 bonds, sold\r\nin France. These bonds were guaranteed by the Haitian Government at an\r\ninterest of 6 per cent on $32,500 for each mile. A short while after the\r\nfloating of these bonds, Mr. Farnham became President of the company.\r\nThe syndicate advanced another $2,000,000 for the completion of the\r\nrailroad in accordance with the concession granted by the Haitian\r\nGovernment. This money was used, but the work was not completed in\r\naccordance with the contract made by the Haitian Government in the\r\nconcession. The Haitian Government then refused any longer to pay the\r\ninterest on the mileage. These happenings were prior to 1915.]\r\n\r\nNow, of all the various responsibilities, expressed, implied, or assumed\r\nby the United States in Haiti, it would naturally be supposed that the\r\nfinancial obligation would be foremost. Indeed, the sister republic of\r\nSanto Domingo was taken over by the United States Navy for no other\r\nreason than failure to pay its internal debt. But Haiti for over one\r\nhundred years scrupulously paid its external and internal debt--a fact\r\nworth remembering when one hears of \"anarchy and disorder\" in that\r\nland--until five years ago when under the financial guardianship of the\r\nUnited States interest on both the internal and, with one exception,\r\nexternal debt was defaulted; and this in spite of the fact that\r\nspecified revenues were pledged for the payment of this interest. Apart\r\nfrom the distinct injury to the honor and reputation of the country, the\r\nhardship on individuals has been great. For while the foreign debt is\r\nheld particularly in France which, being under great financial\r\nobligations to the United States since the beginning of the war, has not\r\nbeen able to protest effectively, the interior debt is held almost\r\nentirely by Haitian citizens. Haitian Government bonds have long been\r\nthe recognized substantial investment for the well-to-do and middle\r\nclass people, considered as are in this country, United States, state,\r\nand municipal bonds. Non-payment on these securities has placed many\r\nfamilies in absolute want.\r\n\r\nWhat has happened to these bonds? They are being sold for a song, for\r\nthe little cash they will bring. Individuals closely connected with the\r\nNational Bank of Haiti are ready purchasers. When the new Haitian loan\r\nis floated it will, of course, contain ample provisions for redeeming\r\nthese old bonds at par. The profits will be more than handsome. Not that\r\nthe National Bank has not already made hay in the sunshine of American\r\nOccupation. From the beginning it has been sole depositary of all\r\nrevenues collected in the name of the Haitian Government by the American\r\nOccupation, receiving in addition to the interest rate a commission on\r\nall funds deposited. The bank is the sole agent in the transmission of\r\nthese funds. It has also the exclusive note-issuing privilege in the\r\nrepublic. At the same time complaint is widespread among the Haitian\r\nbusiness men that the Bank no longer as of old accommodates them with\r\ncredit and that its interests are now entirely in developments of its\r\nown.\r\n\r\nNow, one of the promises that was made to the Haitian Government, partly\r\nto allay its doubts and fears as to the purpose and character of the\r\nAmerican intervention, was that the United States would put the\r\ncountry's finances on a solid and substantial basis. A loan for\r\n$30,000,000 or more was one of the features of this promised assistance.\r\nPursuant, supposedly, to this plan, a Financial Adviser for Haiti was\r\nappointed in the person of Mr. John Avery McIlhenny. Who is Mr.\r\nMcIlhenny? That he has the cordial backing and direction of so able a\r\nfinancier as Mr. Farnham is comforting when one reviews the past record\r\nand experience in finance of Haiti's Financial Adviser as given by him\r\nin \"Who's Who in America,\" for 1918-1919. He was born in Avery Island,\r\nIberia Parish, La.; went to Tulane University for one year; was a\r\nprivate in the Louisiana State militia for five years; trooper in the\r\nU.S. Cavalry in 1898; promoted to second lieutenancy for gallantry in\r\naction at San Juan; has been member of the Louisiana House of\r\nRepresentatives and Senate; was a member of the U. S. Civil Service\r\nCommission in 1906 and president of the same in 1913; Democrat. It is\r\nunder his Financial Advisership that the Haitian interest has been\r\ncontinued in default with the one exception above noted, when several\r\nmonths ago $3,000,000 was converted into francs to meet the accumulated\r\ninterest payments on the foreign debt. Dissatisfaction on the part of\r\nthe Haitians developed over the lack of financial perspicacity in this\r\ntransaction of Mr. McIlhenny because the sum was converted into francs\r\nat the rate of nine to a dollar while shortly after the rate of exchange\r\non French francs dropped to fourteen to a dollar. Indeed, Mr.\r\nMcIlhenny's unfitness by training and experience for the delicate and\r\nimportant position which he is filling was one of the most generally\r\nadmitted facts which I gathered in Haiti.\r\n\r\nAt the present writing, however, Mr. McIlhenny has become a conspicuous\r\nfigure in the history of the Occupation of Haiti as the instrument by\r\nwhich the National City Bank is striving to complete the riveting,\r\ndouble-locking and bolting of its financial control of the island. For\r\nalthough it would appear that the absolute military domination under\r\nwhich Haiti is held would enable the financial powers to accomplish\r\nalmost anything they desire, they are wise enough to realize that a day\r\nof reckoning, such as, for instance, a change in the Administration in\r\nthe United States, may be coming. So they are eager and anxious to have\r\neverything they want signed, sealed, and delivered. Anything, of course,\r\nthat the Haitians have fully \"consented to\" no one else can reasonably\r\nobject to.\r\n\r\nA little recent history: in February of the present year, the ministers\r\nof the different departments, in order to conform to the letter of the\r\nlaw (Article 116 of the Constitution of Haiti, which was saddled upon\r\nher in 1918 by the Occupation[3] and Article 2 of the Haitian-American\r\nConvention[4]) began work on the preparation of the accounts for\r\n1918-1919 and the budget for 1920-1921. On March 22 a draft of the\r\nbudget was sent to Mr. A. J. Maumus, Acting Financial Adviser, in the\r\nabsence of Mr. McIlhenny who had at that time been in the United States\r\nfor seven months. Mr. Maumus replied on March 29, suggesting\r\npostponement of all discussion of the budget until Mr. McIlhenny's\r\nreturn. Nevertheless, the Legislative body, in pursuance of the law,\r\nopened on its constitutional date, Monday, April 5. Despite the great\r\nurgency of the matter in hand, the Haitian administration was obliged to\r\nmark time until June 1, when Mr. McIlhenny returned to Haiti. Several\r\nconferences with the various ministers were then undertaken. On June 12,\r\nat one of these conferences, there arrived in the place of the Financial\r\nAdviser a note stating that he would be obliged to stop all study of the\r\nbudget \"until the time when certain affairs of considerable importance\r\nto the well-being of the country shall be finally settled according to\r\nrecommendations made by me to the Haitian Government.\" As he did not\r\ngive in his note the slightest idea what these important affairs were,\r\nthe Haitian Secretary wrote asking for information, at the same time\r\ncalling attention to the already great and embarrassing delay, and\r\nreminding Mr. McIlhenny that the preparation of the accounts and budget\r\nwas one of his legal duties as an official attached to the Haitian\r\nGovernment, of which he could not divest himself.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: \"The general accounts and the budgets prescribed by the\r\npreceding article must be submitted to the Legislative Body by the\r\nSecretary of Finance not later than eight days after the opening of the\r\nLegislative Session.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: \"The President of Haiti shall appoint, on the nomination of\r\nthe President of the United States, a Financial Adviser who shall be\r\nattached to the Ministry of Finance, to whom the Secretary (of Finance)\r\nshall lend effective aid in the prosecution of his work. The Financial\r\nAdviser shall work out a system of public accounting, shall aid in\r\nincreasing the revenues and in their adjustment to expenditures....\"]\r\n\r\nOn July 19 Mr. McIlhenny supplied his previous omission in a memorandum\r\nwhich he transmitted to the Haitian Department of Finance, in which he\r\nsaid: \"I had instructions from the Department of State of the United\r\nStates just before my departure for Haiti, in a part of a letter of May\r\n20, to declare to the Haitian Government that it was necessary to give\r\nits immediate and formal approval to:\r\n\r\n     1. A modification of the Bank Contract agreed upon by the\r\n     Department of State and the National City Bank of New York.\r\n\r\n     2. Transfer of the National Bank of the Republic of Haiti to a\r\n     new bank registered under the laws of Haiti, to be known as the\r\n     National Bank of the Republic of Haiti.\r\n\r\n     3. The execution of Article 15 of the Contract of Withdrawal\r\n     prohibiting the importation and exportation of non-Haitian\r\n     money except that which might be necessary for the needs of\r\n     commerce in the opinion of the Financial Adviser.\"\r\n\r\nNow, what is the meaning and significance of these proposals? The full\r\ndetails have not been given out, but it is known that they are part of a\r\nnew monetary law for Haiti involving the complete transfer of the Banque\r\nNationale d'Haiti to the National City Bank of New York. The document\r\nembodying the agreements, with the exception of the clause prohibiting\r\nthe importation of foreign money, was signed at Washington, February 6,\r\n1920, by Mr. McIlhenny, the Haitian Minister at Washington and the\r\nHaitian Secretary of Finance. _The Haitian Government has officially\r\ndeclared that the clause prohibiting the importation and exportation of\r\nforeign money, except as it may be deemed necessary in the opinion of\r\nthe Financial Adviser, was added to the original agreement by some\r\nunknown party._ It is for the purpose of compelling the Haitian\r\nGovernment to approve the agreements, including the \"prohibition\r\nclause,\" that pressure is now being applied. Efforts on the part of\r\nbusiness interests in Haiti to learn the character and scope of what was\r\ndone at Washington have been thwarted by close secrecy. However,\r\nsufficient of its import has become known to understand the reasons for\r\nthe unqualified and definite refusal of President Dartiguenave and the\r\nGovernment to give their approval. Those reasons are that the agreements\r\nwould give to the National Bank of Haiti, and thereby to the National\r\nCity Bank of New York, exclusive monopoly upon the right of importing\r\nand exporting American and other foreign money to and from Haiti, a\r\nmonopoly which would carry unprecedented and extraordinarily lucrative\r\nprivileges.\r\n\r\nThe proposal involved in this agreement has called forth a vigorous\r\nprotest on the part of every important banking and business concern in\r\nHaiti with the exception, of course, of the National Bank of Haiti. This\r\nprotest was transmitted to the Haitian Minister of Finance on July 30\r\npast. The protest is signed not only by Haitians and Europeans doing\r\nbusiness in that country but also by the leading American business\r\nconcerns, among which are The American Foreign Banking Corporation, The\r\nHaitian-American Sugar Company, The Panama Railroad Steamship Line, The\r\nClyde Steamship Line, and The West Indies Trading Company. Among the\r\nforeign signers are the Royal Bank of Canada, Le Comptoir Francais, Le\r\nComptoir Commercial, and besides a number of business firms.\r\n\r\nWe have now in Haiti a triangular situation with the National City Bank\r\nand our Department of State in two corners and the Haitian government in\r\nthe third. Pressure is being brought on the Haitian government to compel\r\nit to grant a monopoly which on its face appears designed to give the\r\nNational City Bank a strangle hold on the financial life of that\r\ncountry. With the Haitian government refusing to yield, we have the\r\nFinancial Adviser who is, according to the Haitian-American Convention,\r\na Haitian official charged with certain duties (in this case the\r\napproval of the budget and accounts), refusing to carry out those duties\r\nuntil the government yields to the pressure which is being brought.\r\n\r\nHaiti is now experiencing the \"third degree.\" Ever since the Bank\r\nContract was drawn and signed at Washington increasing pressure has been\r\napplied to make the Haitian government accept the clause prohibiting the\r\nimportation of foreign money. Mr. McIlhenny is now holding up the\r\nsalaries of the President, ministers of departments, members of the\r\nCouncil of State, and the official interpreter. [These salaries have not\r\nbeen paid since July 1.] And there the matter now stands.\r\n\r\nSeveral things may happen. The Administration, finding present methods\r\ninsufficient, may decide to act as in Santo Domingo, to abolish the\r\nPresident, cabinet, and all civil government--as they have already\r\nabolished the Haitian Assembly--and put into effect, by purely military\r\nforce, what, in the face of the unflinching Haitian refusal to sign away\r\ntheir birthright, the combined military, civil, and financial pressure\r\nhas been unable to accomplish. Or, with an election and a probable\r\nchange of Administration in this country pending, with a Congressional\r\ninvestigation foreshadowed, it may be decided that matters are \"too\r\ndifficult\" and the National City Bank may find that it can be more\r\nprofitably engaged elsewhere. Indications of such a course are not\r\nlacking. From the point of view of the National City Bank, of course,\r\nthe institution has not only done nothing which is not wholly\r\nlegitimate, proper, and according to the canons of big business\r\nthroughout the world, but has actually performed constructive and\r\ngenerous service to a backward and uncivilized people in attempting to\r\npromote their railways, to develop their country, and to shape soundly\r\ntheir finance. That Mr. Farnham and those associated with him hold these\r\nviews sincerely, there is no doubt. But that the Haitians, after over\r\none hundred years of self-government and liberty, contemplating the\r\nslaughter of three thousand of their sons, the loss of their political\r\nand economic freedom, without compensating advantages which they can\r\nappreciate, feel very differently, is equally true.\r\n\r\n_From The Nation of September 11, 1920._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. THE HAITIAN PEOPLE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first sight of Port-au-Prince is perhaps most startling to the\r\nexperienced Latin-American traveler. Caribbean cities are of the\r\nSpanish-American type--buildings square and squat, built generally\r\naround a court, with residences and business houses scarcely\r\ninterdistinguishable. Port-au-Prince is rather a city of the French or\r\nItalian Riviera. Across the bay of deepest blue the purple mountains of\r\nGonave loom against the Western sky, rivaling the bay's azure depths.\r\nBack of the business section, spreading around the bay's great sweep and\r\nwell into the plain beyond, rise the green hills with their white\r\nresidences. The residential section spreads over the slopes and into the\r\nmountain tiers. High up are the homes of the well-to-do, beautiful\r\nvillas set in green gardens relieved by the flaming crimson of the\r\npoinsettia. Despite the imposing mountains a man-made edifice dominates\r\nthe scene. From the center of the city the great Gothic cathedral lifts\r\nits spires above the tranquil city. Well-paved and clean, the city\r\nprolongs the thrill of its first unfolding. Cosmopolitan yet quaint,\r\nwith an old-world atmosphere yet a charm of its own, one gets throughout\r\nthe feeling of continental European life. In the hotels and cafes the\r\naffairs of the world are heard discussed in several languages. The\r\ncuisine and service are not only excellent but inexpensive. At the Cafe\r\nDereix, cool and scrupulously clean, dinner from _hors d'oeuvres_ to\r\n_glaces_, with wine, of course, recalling the famous antebellum\r\nhostelries of New York and Paris, may be had for six gourdes [$1.25].\r\n\r\nA drive of two hours around Port-au-Prince, through the newer section of\r\nbrick and concrete buildings, past the cathedral erected from 1903 to\r\n1912, along the Champ de Mars where the new presidential palace stands,\r\nup into the Peu de Choses section where the hundreds of beautiful villas\r\nand grounds of the well-to-do are situated, permanently dispels any\r\nlingering question that the Haitians have been retrograding during the\r\n116 years of their independence.\r\n\r\nIn the lower city, along the water's edge, around the market and in the\r\nRue Republicaine, is the \"local color.\" The long rows of wooden\r\nshanties, the curious little booths around the market, filled with\r\njabbering venders and with scantily clad children, magnificent in body,\r\nrunning in and out, are no less picturesque and no more primitive, no\r\nhumbler, yet cleaner, than similar quarters in Naples, in Lisbon, in\r\nMarseilles, and more justifiable than the great slums of civilization's\r\ncenters--London and New York, which are totally without aesthetic\r\nredemption. But it is only the modernists in history who are willing to\r\nlook at the masses as factors in the life and development of the\r\ncountry, and in its history. For Haitian history, like history the world\r\nover, has for the last century been that of cultured and educated\r\ngroups. To know Haitian life one must have the privilege of being\r\nreceived as a guest in the houses of these latter, and they live in\r\nbeautiful houses. The majority have been educated in France; they are\r\ncultured, brilliant conversationally, and thoroughly enjoy their social\r\nlife. The women dress well. Many are beautiful and all vivacious and\r\nchic. Cultivated people from any part of the world would feel at home in\r\nthe best Haitian society. If our guest were to enter to the Cercle\r\nBellevue, the leading club of Port-au-Prince, he would find the\r\ncourteous, friendly atmosphere of a men's club; he would hear varying\r\nshades of opinion on public questions, and could scarcely fail to be\r\nimpressed by the thorough knowledge of world affairs possessed by the\r\nintelligent Haitian. Nor would his encounters be only with people who\r\nhave culture and savoir vivre; he would meet the Haitian\r\nintellectuals--poets, essayists, novelists, historians, critics. Take\r\nfor example such a writer as Fernand Hibbert. An English authority says\r\nof him, \"His essays are worthy of the pen of Anatole France or Pierre\r\nLoti.\" And there is Georges Sylvaine, poet and essayist, conferencier at\r\nthe Sorbonne, where his address was received with acclaim, author of\r\nbooks crowned by the French Academy, and an Officer of the Legion\r\nd'Honneur. Hibbert and Sylvaine are only two among a dozen or more\r\ncontemporary Haitian men of letters whose work may be measured by world\r\nstandards. Two names that stand out preeminently in Haitian literature\r\nare Oswald Durand, the national poet, who died a few years ago, and\r\nDamocles Vieux. These people, educated, cultured, and intellectual, are\r\nnot accidental and sporadic offshoots of the Haitian people; they _are_\r\nthe Haitian people and they are a demonstration of its inherent\r\npotentialities.\r\n\r\nHowever, Port-au-Prince is not all of Haiti. Other cities are smaller\r\nreplicas, and fully as interesting are the people of the country\r\ndistricts. Perhaps the deepest impression on the observant visitor is\r\nmade by the country women. Magnificent as they file along the country\r\nroads by scores and by hundreds on their way to the town markets, with\r\nwhite or colored turbaned heads, gold-looped-ringed ears, they stride\r\nalong straight and lithe, almost haughtily, carrying themselves like so\r\nmany Queens of Sheba. The Haitian country people are kind-hearted,\r\nhospitable, and polite, seldom stupid but rather, quick-witted and\r\nimaginative. Fond of music, with a profound sense of beauty and harmony,\r\nthey live simply but wholesomely. Their cabins rarely consist of only\r\none room, the humblest having two or three, with a little shed front and\r\nback, a front and rear entrance, and plenty of windows. An aesthetic\r\ntouch is never lacking--a flowering hedge or an arbor with trained vines\r\nbearing gorgeous colored blossoms. There is no comparison between the\r\nneat plastered-wall, thatched-roof cabin of the Haitian peasant and the\r\ntraditional log hut of the South or the shanty of the more wretched\r\nAmerican suburbs. The most notable feature about the Haitian cabin is\r\nits invariable cleanliness. At daylight the country people are up and\r\nabout, the women begin their sweeping till the earthen or pebble-paved\r\nfloor of the cabin is clean as can be. Then the yards around the cabin\r\nare vigorously attacked. In fact, nowhere in the country districts of\r\nHaiti does one find the filth and squalor which may be seen in any\r\nbackwoods town in our own South. Cleanliness is a habit and a dirty\r\nHaitian is a rare exception. The garments even of the men who work on\r\nthe wharves, mended and patched until little of the original cloth is\r\nvisible, give evidence of periodical washing. The writer recalls a\r\nremark made by Mr. E. P. Pawley, an American, who conducts one of the\r\nlargest business enterprises in Haiti. He said that the Haitians were an\r\nexceptionally clean people, that statistics showed that Haiti imported\r\nmore soap per capita than any country in the world, and added, \"They use\r\nit, too.\" Three of the largest soap manufactories in the United States\r\nmaintain headquarters at Port-au-Prince.\r\n\r\nThe masses of the Haitian people are splendid material for the building\r\nof a nation. They are not lazy; on the contrary, they are industrious\r\nand thrifty. Some observers mistakenly confound primitive methods with\r\nindolence. Anyone who travels Haitian roads is struck by the hundreds\r\nand even thousands of women, boys, and girls filing along mile after\r\nmile with their farm and garden produce on their heads or loaded on the\r\nbacks of animals. With modern facilities, they could market their\r\nproduce much more efficiently and with far less effort. But lacking them\r\nthey are willing to walk and carry. For a woman to walk five to ten\r\nmiles with a great load of produce on her head which may barely realize\r\nher a dollar is doubtless primitive, and a wasteful expenditure of\r\nenergy, but it is not a sign of laziness. Haiti's great handicap has\r\nbeen not that her masses are degraded or lazy or immoral. It is that\r\nthey are ignorant, due not so much to mental limitations as to enforced\r\nilliteracy. There is a specific reason for this. Somehow the French\r\nlanguage, in the French-American colonial settlements containing a Negro\r\npopulation, divided itself into two branches, French and Creole. This is\r\ntrue of Louisiana, Martinique, Guadeloupe, and also of Haiti. Creole is\r\nan Africanized French and must not be thought of as a mere dialect. The\r\nFrench-speaking person cannot understand Creole, excepting a few words,\r\nunless he learns it. Creole is a distinct tongue, a graphic and very\r\nexpressive language. Many of its constructions follow closely the\r\nAfrican idioms. For example, in forming the superlative of greatness,\r\none says in Creole, \"He is great among great men,\" and a merchant woman,\r\nfollowing the native idiom, will say, \"You do not wish anything\r\nbeautiful if you do not buy this.\" The upper Haitian class,\r\napproximately 500,000, speak and know French, while the masses, probably\r\nmore than 2,000,000 speak only Creole. Haitian Creole is grammatically\r\nconstructed, but has not to any general extent been reduced to writing.\r\nTherefore, these masses have no means of receiving or communicating\r\nthoughts through the written word. They have no books to read. They\r\ncannot read the newspapers. The children of the masses study French for\r\na few years in school, but it never becomes their every-day language. In\r\norder to abolish Haitian illiteracy, Creole must be made a printed as\r\nwell as a spoken language. The failure to undertake this problem is the\r\nworst indictment against the Haitian Government.\r\n\r\nThis matter of language proves a handicap to Haiti in another manner. It\r\nisolates her from her sister republics. All of the Latin-American\r\nrepublics except Brazil speak Spanish and enjoy an intercourse with the\r\noutside world denied Haiti. Dramatic and musical companies from Spain,\r\nfrom Mexico and from the Argentine annually tour all of the\r\nSpanish-speaking republics. Haiti is deprived of all such instruction\r\nand entertainment from the outside world because it is not profitable\r\nfor French companies to visit the three or four French-speaking islands\r\nin the Western Hemisphere.\r\n\r\nMuch stress has been laid on the bloody history of Haiti and its\r\nnumerous revolutions. Haitian history has been all too bloody, but so\r\nhas that of every other country, and the bloodiness of the Haitian\r\nrevolutions has of late been unduly magnified. A writer might visit our\r\nown country and clip from our daily press accounts of murders, robberies\r\non the principal streets of our larger cities, strike violence, race\r\nriots, lynchings, and burnings at the stake of human beings, and write a\r\nbook to prove that life is absolutely unsafe in the United States. The\r\nseriousness of the frequent Latin-American revolutions has been greatly\r\nover-emphasized. The writer has been in the midst of three of these\r\nrevolutions and must confess that the treatment given them on our comic\r\nopera stage is very little farther removed from the truth than the\r\ntreatment which is given in the daily newspapers. Not nearly so bloody\r\nas reported, their interference with people not in politics is almost\r\nnegligible. Nor should it be forgotten that in almost every instance the\r\nrevolution is due to the plotting of foreigners backed up by their\r\nGovernments. No less an authority than Mr. John H. Allen, vice-president\r\nof the National City Bank of New York, writing on Haiti in the May\r\nnumber of _The Americas_, the National City Bank organ, who says, \"It is\r\nno secret that the revolutions were financed by foreigners and were\r\nprofitable speculations.\"\r\n\r\nIn this matter of change of government by revolution, Haiti must not be\r\ncompared with the United States or with England; it must be compared\r\nwith other Latin American republics. When it is compared with our next\r\ndoor neighbor, Mexico, it will be found that the Government of Haiti has\r\nbeen more stable and that the country has experienced less bloodshed and\r\nanarchy. And it must never be forgotten that throughout not an American\r\nor other foreigner has been killed, injured or, as far as can be\r\nascertained, even molested. In Haiti's 116 years of independence, there\r\nhave been twenty-five presidents and twenty-five different\r\nadministrations. In Mexico, during its 99 years of independence, there\r\nhave been forty-seven rulers and eighty-seven administrations. \"Graft\"\r\nhas been plentiful, shocking at times, but who in America, where the\r\nTammany machines and the municipal rings are notorious, will dare to\r\npoint the finger of scorn at Haiti in this connection.\r\n\r\nAnd this is the people whose \"inferiority,\" whose \"retrogression,\" whose\r\n\"savagery,\" is advanced as a justification for intervention--for the\r\nruthless slaughter of three thousand of its practically defenseless\r\nsons, with the death of a score of our own boys, for the utterly selfish\r\nexploitation of the country by American big finance, for the destruction\r\nof America's most precious heritage--her traditional fair play, her\r\nsense of justice, her aid to the oppressed. \"Inferiority\" always was the\r\nexcuse of ruthless imperialism until the Germans invaded Belgium, when\r\nit became \"military necessity.\" In the case of Haiti there is not the\r\nslightest vestige of any of the traditional justifications, unwarranted\r\nas these generally are, and no amount of misrepresentation in an era\r\nwhen propaganda and censorship have had their heyday, no amount of\r\nslander, even in a country deeply prejudiced where color is involved,\r\nwill longer serve to obscure to the conscience of America the eternal\r\nshame of its last five years in Haiti. _Fiat justitia, ruat coelum!_\r\n\r\n_From The Nation of September 25, 1920._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDocuments\r\n\r\n_The following are from The Nation of August 28, 1920_\r\n\r\nThe Proposed Convention with Haiti\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fuller Convention, submitted to the Haitian Minister of Foreign\r\nAffairs on May 22, 1915, by Mr. Paul Fuller, Jr., Envoy Extraordinary of\r\nthe United States to Haiti, read as follows, the preliminary and\r\nconcluding paragraphs being omitted:\r\n\r\n     1. The Government of the United States of America will protect\r\n     the Republic of Haiti from outside attack and from the\r\n     aggression of any foreign Power, and to that end will employ\r\n     such forces of the army and navy of the United States as may be\r\n     necessary.\r\n\r\n     2. The Government of the United States of America will aid the\r\n     Government of Haiti to suppress insurrection from within and\r\n     will give effective support by the employment of the armed\r\n     forces of the United States army and navy to the extent needed.\r\n\r\n     3. The President of the Republic of Haiti covenants that no\r\n     rights, privileges, or facilities of any description whatsoever\r\n     will be granted, sold, leased, or otherwise accorded directly\r\n     or indirectly by the Government of Haiti concerning the\r\n     occupation or use of the Mole Saint-Nicolas to any foreign\r\n     government or to a national or the nationals of any other\r\n     foreign government.\r\n\r\n     4. The President of the Republic of Haiti covenants that within\r\n     six months from the signing of this convention, the Government\r\n     will enter into an arbitration agreement for the settlement of\r\n     such claims as American citizens or other foreigners may have\r\n     against the Government of Haiti, such arbitration agreement to\r\n     provide for the equal treatment of all foreigners to the end\r\n     that the people of Haiti may have the benefit of competition\r\n     between the nationals of all countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Haitian Counter-Project\r\n\r\n\r\nThe counter-project of the Haitian Government, of June 4, 1915, with\r\nsuch of the modifications suggested by Mr. Fuller as the Haitian\r\nGovernment was willing to accept, read as follows:\r\n\r\n     I. The Government of the United States of America will lend its\r\n     assistance to the Republic of Haiti for the preservation of its\r\n     independence. For that purpose it agrees to intervene to\r\n     prevent the intrusion of any Power and to repulse any act of\r\n     aggression against the Republic of Haiti. To that end it will\r\n     employ such forces of the army and navy of the United States as\r\n     may be necessary.\r\n\r\n     II. The Government of the United States will facilitate the\r\n     entry into Haiti of sufficient capital to assure the full\r\n     economic development of that country, and to improve, within\r\n     the immediate future, its financial situation, especially to\r\n     bring about the unification of its debt in such fashion as to\r\n     reduce the customs guaranties now required, and to lead to a\r\n     fundamental money reform.\r\n\r\n     In order to give such capital all desirable guaranties the\r\n     Government of Haiti agrees to employ in the customs service\r\n     only officials whose ability and character are well known, and\r\n     to replace those who in practice are found not to fill these\r\n     conditions.\r\n\r\n     The Government of Haiti will also assure the protection of\r\n     capital and in general of all foreign interests by the\r\n     organization of a mounted rural constabulary trained in the\r\n     most modern methods.\r\n\r\n     In the meantime if it be necessary the Government of the United\r\n     States, after consultation with the Government of Haiti, will\r\n     give its aid in the repression of serious disorders or troubles\r\n     which might compromise these foreign interests.\r\n\r\n     The American forces which have in the given circumstances\r\n     cooperated with the Haitian troops in the restoration of order,\r\n     should be retired from Haitian territory at the first request\r\n     of the constitutional authority.\r\n\r\n     III. The President of the Republic of Haiti covenants that no\r\n     rights, privileges, or facilities of any description whatsoever\r\n     will be granted, sold, leased, or otherwise accorded directly\r\n     or indirectly by the Government of Haiti concerning the\r\n     occupation or use of the Mole Saint-Nicolas to any foreign\r\n     government or to a national or the nationals of any other\r\n     foreign government.\r\n\r\n     IV. The President of the Republic of Haiti covenants within six\r\n     months of the signing of this convention to sign a convention\r\n     of arbitration with the Powers concerned for the settlement of\r\n     the diplomatic claims pending, which arbitration convention\r\n     will provide for the equal treatment of all claimants, no\r\n     special privileges being granted to any of them.\r\n\r\n     V. In case of difficulties regarding the interpretation of the\r\n     clauses of the present convention, the high contracting parties\r\n     agree to submit the difference to the Permanent Court of\r\n     Arbitration at The Hague.\r\n\r\nMr. Fuller had suggested a further modification which the Haitian\r\nGovernment refused. It changed the final paragraph of Article II to\r\nread: \"The American forces which have in the given circumstance\r\ncooperated with the Haitian troops, shall, when order has been\r\nreestablished, be retired,\" etc. His other suggestions were accepted\r\nwith unimportant verbal changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Haitian-United States Convention\r\n\r\n\r\nThe convention between the United States and Haiti was ratified on\r\nSeptember 16, 1915, after the occupation of the country by American\r\ntroops. In its final form it is in interesting contrast with the\r\nsuggested agreements printed above.\r\n\r\n     The United States and the Republic of Haiti, desiring to\r\n     confirm and strengthen the amity existing between them by the\r\n     most cordial cooperation in measures for their common\r\n     advantage, and the Republic of Haiti desiring to remedy the\r\n     present condition of its revenues and finances, to maintain the\r\n     tranquillity of the Republic, to carry out plans for the\r\n     economic development and prosperity of the Republic and its\r\n     people, and the United States being in full sympathy with all\r\n     of these aims and objects and desiring to contribute in all\r\n     proper ways to their accomplishment;\r\n\r\n     The United States and the Republic of Haiti have resolved to\r\n     conclude a convention with these objects in view, and have\r\n     appointed for that purpose plenipotentiaries:\r\n\r\n     The President of the Republic of Haiti, Mr. Louis Borno,\r\n     Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and Public Instruction,\r\n\r\n     The President of the United States, Mr. Robert Beale Davis,\r\n     Jr., Charge d'Affaires of the United States of America;\r\n\r\n     Who, having exhibited to each other their respective powers,\r\n     which are seen to be full in good and true form, have agreed as\r\n     follows:\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE I. The Government of the United States will, by its\r\n     good offices, aid the Haitian Government in the proper and\r\n     efficient development of its agricultural, mineral, and\r\n     commercial resources and in the establishment of the finances\r\n     of Haiti on a firm and solid basis.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE II. The President of Haiti shall appoint, upon\r\n     nomination by the President of the United States, a General\r\n     Receiver and such aids and employees as may be necessary, who\r\n     shall collect, receive, and apply all customs duties on imports\r\n     and exports accruing at the several customs-houses and ports of\r\n     entry of the Republic of Haiti.\r\n\r\n     The President of Haiti shall appoint, upon nomination by the\r\n     President of the United States, a Financial Adviser who shall\r\n     be an officer attached to the Ministry of Finance, to give\r\n     effect to whose proposals and labors the Minister will lend\r\n     efficient aid. The Financial Adviser shall devise an adequate\r\n     system of public accounting, aid in increasing the revenues and\r\n     adjusting them to the expenses, inquire into the validity of\r\n     the debts of the Republic, enlighten both governments with\r\n     reference to all eventual debts, recommend improved methods of\r\n     collecting and applying the revenues, and make such other\r\n     recommendations to the Minister of Finance as may be deemed\r\n     necessary for the welfare and prosperity of Haiti.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE III. The Government of the Republic of Haiti will\r\n     provide by law or appropriate decrees for the payment of all\r\n     customs duties to the General Receiver, and will extend to the\r\n     Receivership, and to the Financial Adviser, all needful aid and\r\n     full protection in the execution of the powers conferred and\r\n     duties imposed herein; and the United States on its part will\r\n     extend like aid and protection.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE IV. Upon the appointment of the Financial Adviser, the\r\n     Government of the Republic of Haiti in cooperation with the\r\n     Financial Adviser, shall collate, classify, arrange, and make\r\n     full statement of all the debts of the Republic, the amounts,\r\n     character, maturity, and condition thereof, and the interest\r\n     accruing and the sinking fund requisite to their final\r\n     discharge.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE V. All sums collected and received by the General\r\n     Receiver shall be applied, first to the payment of the salaries\r\n     and allowances of the General Receiver, his assistants, and\r\n     employees and expenses of the Receivership, including the\r\n     salary and expenses of the Financial Adviser, which salaries\r\n     will be determined by the previous agreement; second, to the\r\n     interest and sinking fund of the public debt of the Republic of\r\n     Haiti; and third, to the maintenance of the constabulary\r\n     referred to in Article X, and then the remainder to the Haitian\r\n     Government for the purposes of current expenses.\r\n\r\n     In making these applications the General Receiver will proceed\r\n     to pay salaries and allowances monthly and expenses as they\r\n     arise, and on the first of each calendar month will set aside\r\n     in a separate fund the quantum of the collections and receipts\r\n     of the previous month.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE VI. The expenses of the Receivership, including\r\n     salaries and allowances of the General Receiver, his\r\n     assistants, and employees, and the salary and expenses of the\r\n     Financial Adviser, shall not exceed 5 per cent of the\r\n     collections and receipts from customs duties, unless by\r\n     agreement by the two governments.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE VII. The General Receiver shall make monthly reports of\r\n     all collections, receipts, and disbursements to the appropriate\r\n     officers of the Republic of Haiti and to the Department of\r\n     State of the United States, which reports shall be open to\r\n     inspection and verification at all times by the appropriate\r\n     authorities of each of the said governments.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE VIII. The Republic of Haiti shall not increase its\r\n     public debt, except by previous agreement with the President of\r\n     the United States, and shall not contract any debt or assume\r\n     any financial obligation unless the ordinary revenues of the\r\n     Republic available for that purpose, after defraying the\r\n     expenses of the Government, shall be adequate to pay the\r\n     interest and provide a sinking fund for the final discharge of\r\n     such debt.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE IX. The Republic of Haiti will not, without the assent\r\n     of the President of the United States, modify the customs\r\n     duties in a manner to reduce the revenues therefrom; and in\r\n     order that the revenues of the Republic may be adequate to meet\r\n     the public debt and the expenses of the Government, to preserve\r\n     tranquillity, and to promote material prosperity, the Republic\r\n     of Haiti will cooperate with the Financial Adviser in his\r\n     recommendations for improvement in the methods of collecting\r\n     and disbursing the revenues and for new sources of needed\r\n     income.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE X. The Haitian Government obligates itself, for the\r\n     preservation of domestic peace, the security of individual\r\n     rights, and the full observance of the provisions of this\r\n     treaty, to create without delay an efficient constabulary,\r\n     urban and rural, composed of native Haitians. This constabulary\r\n     shall be organized and officered by Americans appointed by the\r\n     President of Haiti, upon nomination by the President of the\r\n     United States. The Haitian Government shall clothe these\r\n     officers with the proper and necessary authority and uphold\r\n     them in the performance of their functions. These officers will\r\n     be replaced by Haitians as they, by examination conducted under\r\n     direction of a board to be selected by the senior American\r\n     officer of this constabulary in the presence of a\r\n     representative of the Haitian Government, are found to be\r\n     qualified to assume such duties. The constabulary herein\r\n     provided for shall, under the direction of the Haitian\r\n     Government, have supervision and control of arms and\r\n     ammunition, military supplies and traffic therein, throughout\r\n     the country. The high contracting parties agree that the\r\n     stipulations in this article are necessary to prevent factional\r\n     strife and disturbances.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE XI. The Government of Haiti agrees not to surrender any\r\n     of the territory of the Republic of Haiti by sale, lease, or\r\n     otherwise, or jurisdiction over such territory, to any foreign\r\n     government or Power, nor to enter into any treaty or contract\r\n     with any foreign Power or Powers that will impair or tend to\r\n     impair the independence of Haiti.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE XII. The Haitian Government agrees to execute with the\r\n     United States a protocol for the settlement, by arbitration or\r\n     otherwise, of all pending pecuniary claims of foreign\r\n     corporations, companies, citizens, or subjects against Haiti.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE XIII. The Republic of Haiti, being desirous to further\r\n     the development of its natural resources, agrees to undertake\r\n     and execute such measures as, in the opinion of the high\r\n     contracting parties, may be necessary for the sanitation and\r\n     public improvement of the Republic under the supervision and\r\n     direction of an engineer or engineers, to be appointed by the\r\n     President of Haiti upon nomination of the President of the\r\n     United States, and authorized for that purpose by the\r\n     Government of Haiti.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE XIV. The high contracting parties shall have authority\r\n     to take such steps as may be necessary to insure the complete\r\n     attainment of any of the objects comprehended in this treaty;\r\n     and should the necessity occur, the United States will lend an\r\n     efficient aid for the preservation of Haitian independence and\r\n     the maintenance of a government adequate for the protection of\r\n     life, property, and individual liberty.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE XV. The present treaty shall be approved and ratified\r\n     by the high contracting parties in conformity with their\r\n     respective laws, and the ratifications thereof shall be\r\n     exchanged in the City of Washington as soon as may be possible.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE XVI. The present treaty shall remain in full force and\r\n     virtue for the term of ten years, to be counted from the day of\r\n     exchange of ratifications, and further for another term of ten\r\n     years if, for specific reasons presented by either of the high\r\n     contracting parties, the purpose of this treaty has not been\r\n     fully accomplished.\r\n\r\n     In faith whereof, the respective plenipotentiaries have signed\r\n     the present convention in duplicate, in the English and French\r\n     languages, and have thereunto affixed their seals.\r\n\r\n     Done at Port-au-Prince (Haiti), the 16th day of September\r\n     in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and fifteen.\r\n\r\n     ROBERT BEALE DAVIS, JR.,\r\n     Charge d'Affaires of the United States\r\n\r\n     LOUIS BORNO,\r\n     Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs\r\n     and Public Instruction\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe New Constitution of Haiti\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new Constitution of the Republic of Haiti, ratified under the\r\nAmerican Occupation, altered the former Constitution in regard to the\r\nimportant subject of the right of foreigners to hold land. Article 6 of\r\nthe old Constitution reads:\r\n\r\n     No one, unless he is a Haitian, may be a holder of land in\r\n     Haiti, regardless of what his title may be, nor acquire any\r\n     real estate.\r\n\r\nArticle 5 of the Constitution of 1918 makes the following provision:\r\n\r\n     The right to hold property is given to foreigners residing in\r\n     Haiti, and to societies formed by foreigners, for dwelling\r\n     purposes and for agricultural, commercial, industrial, or\r\n     educational enterprises. This right shall be discontinued five\r\n     years after the foreigner shall have ceased to reside in the\r\n     country, or when the activities of these companies shall have\r\n     ceased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Haitian President's Proclamation\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the _Moniteur_, official organ of the Republic of Haiti, for\r\nSeptember 4, 1915, in a column headed \"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity,\"\r\nthe president of Haiti published a proclamation on the situation arising\r\nfrom the occupation by American troops of the customs-house at\r\nPort-au-Prince.\r\n\r\n     Haitians! At the very moment when the Government, engaged in\r\n     negotiations to settle the question of the presence of American\r\n     military forces on Haitian territory, was looking forward to a\r\n     prompt solution in accordance with law and justice, it finds\r\n     itself faced with the simple seizure of possession of the\r\n     customs administration of the capital.\r\n\r\n     Previously the customs-houses of several other cities of the\r\n     republic had been occupied in like fashion, and whenever the\r\n     news of such occupation reached the National Palace or the\r\n     Department of Finances, it was followed by an energetic\r\n     protest, demanding that the diplomatic representative of the\r\n     American Government residing at Port-au-Prince restore the\r\n     customs-houses and put an end to acts so contrary to the\r\n     relations at present existing between the Government of Haiti\r\n     and the Government of the United States of North America.\r\n\r\n     Haitians! In bringing these facts officially to the attention\r\n     of the country, I owe it to myself to declare further, in the\r\n     most formal fashion, to you and to the entire civilized world,\r\n     that the order to carry out these acts so destructive of the\r\n     interests, rights, and sovereignty of the Haitian people is not\r\n     due to anything which can be cited against the patriotism,\r\n     devotion, spirit of sacrifice, and loyalty of those to whom the\r\n     destinies of the country have been intrusted. You are the\r\n     judges of that.\r\n\r\n     Nor will I conceal the fact that my astonishment is greater\r\n     because the negotiations, which had been undertaken in the hope\r\n     of an agreement upon the basis of propositions presented by the\r\n     American Government itself, after having passed through the\r\n     ordinary phases of diplomatic discussion, with frankness and\r\n     courtesy on both sides, have now been relieved of the only\r\n     obstacles which had hitherto appeared to stand in their way.\r\n\r\n     Haitians! In this agonizing situation, more than tragic for\r\n     every truly Haitian soul, the Government, which intends to\r\n     preserve full national sovereignty, will be able to maintain\r\n     the necessary resolution only if all are united in exercising\r\n     their intelligence and energy with it in the present task of\r\n     saving the nation....\r\n\r\n     SUDRE DARTIGUENAVE\r\n\r\n     Given at the National Palace, September 2, 1915, in the 112th\r\n     year of our independence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The following are from the Nation of September 11, 1920_\r\n\r\nWhy Haiti Has No Budget\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the session of the Haitian National Assembly on August 4, the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Haiti and the Haitian Minister of Finance\r\nlaid before that body the course of the American Financial Adviser which\r\nhad made it impossible to submit to the Assembly accounts and budgets in\r\naccordance with the Constitution of Haiti and the Haiti-American\r\nConvention. The statement which follows is taken from the official\r\nHaitian gazette, the _Moniteur_ of August 7.\r\n\r\n     MESSAGE OF THE PRESIDENT\r\n\r\n     Gentlemen of the Council of State: On account of unforeseen\r\n     circumstances it has not been possible for the Government of\r\n     the Republic to present to you in the course of the session of\r\n     your high assembly which closes today (August 4) the general\r\n     accounts of the receipts and expenditures for 1918-1919 and the\r\n     budget for 1920-1921, in accordance with the Constitution.\r\n\r\n     It is certainly an exceptional case, the gravity of which will\r\n     not escape you. You will learn the full details from the report\r\n     which the Secretary of Finance and Commerce will submit to you,\r\n     in which it will be shown that the responsibility for it does\r\n     not fall on the Executive Power....\r\n\r\n     In the life of every people there come moments when it must\r\n     know how to be resigned and to suffer. Are we facing one of\r\n     those moments? The attitude of the Haitian people, calm and\r\n     dignified, persuades me that, marching closely with the\r\n     Government of the Republic, there is no suffering which it is\r\n     not disposed to undergo to safeguard and secure the triumph of\r\n     its rights.\r\n\r\n     DARTIGUENAVE\r\n\r\n\r\n     REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF FINANCE AND COMMERCE\r\n\r\n     Gentlemen of the Council of State: Article 116 of the\r\n     Constitution prescribes in its first paragraph: \"The general\r\n     accounts and the budgets prescribed by the preceding article\r\n     must be submitted to the legislative body by the Secretary of\r\n     Finance not later than eight days after the opening of the\r\n     legislative session.\"\r\n\r\n     And Article 2 of the American-Haitian Convention of September\r\n     16, 1915, stipulates in its second paragraph: \"The President of\r\n     Haiti shall appoint, on the nomination of the President of the\r\n     United States, a Financial Adviser, _who shall be a civil\r\n     servant attached to the Ministry of Finance_, to whom the\r\n     Secretary shall lend effective aid in the prosecution of his\r\n     work. The Financial Adviser shall work out a system of public\r\n     accounting, shall aid in increasing the revenues and in their\r\n     adjustment to expenditures....\"\r\n\r\n     Since February of this year (1920) the secretaries of the\r\n     various departments, in order to conform to the letter of\r\n     Article 116 of the Constitution, and to assure continuity of\r\n     public service in the matter of receipts and expenditures, set\r\n     to work at the preparation of the budgets for their departments\r\n     for 1920-21.\r\n\r\n     By a dispatch dated March 22, 1920, the Department of Finance\r\n     sent the draft budgets to Mr. A. J. Maumus, Acting Financial\r\n     Adviser, for preliminary study by that official. But the Acting\r\n     Adviser replied to the Department by a letter, of March 29: \"I\r\n     suggest that, in view of the early return of Mr. John\r\n     McIlhenny, the Financial Adviser, measures be taken to postpone\r\n     all discussion regarding the said draft budgets between the\r\n     different departments and the Office [of the Financial Adviser]\r\n     to permit him to take part in the discussions.\"\r\n\r\n     Nevertheless, the regular session was opened on the\r\n     constitutional date, Monday, April 5, 1920. Mr. John McIlhenny,\r\n     the titular Financial Adviser, absent in the United States\r\n     since October, 1919, on a financial mission for the Government,\r\n     prolonged his stay in America, detained no doubt by the\r\n     insurmountable difficulties in the accomplishment of his\r\n     mission (the placing of a Haitian loan on the New York market).\r\n     Since on the one hand the Adviser could not overcome these\r\n     difficulties, and on the other hand his presence at\r\n     Port-au-Prince was absolutely necessary for the preparation of\r\n     the budget in conformity with the Constitution and the\r\n     Haitian-American Convention, the Government deemed it essential\r\n     to ask him to return to Port-au-Prince for that purpose. The\r\n     Government in so doing secured the good offices of the American\r\n     Legation, and Mr. McIlhenny returned from the United States\r\n     about the first of June. The Legislature had already been in\r\n     session almost two months.\r\n\r\n     About June 15 the Adviser began the study of the budget with\r\n     the secretaries. The conferences lasted about twelve days, and\r\n     in that time, after courteous discussions, after some cuts,\r\n     modifications, and additions, plans for the following budgets\r\n     were agreed upon:\r\n\r\n       1. Ways and Means\r\n       2. Foreign Relations\r\n       3. Finance and Commerce\r\n       4. Interior\r\n\r\n     On Monday, July 12, at 3.30, the hour agreed upon between the\r\n     ministers and the Adviser, the ministers met to continue the\r\n     study of the budget which they wanted to finish quickly....\r\n     Between 4 and 4:30 the Secretary of Finance received a letter\r\n     from the Adviser which reads as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"I find myself obliged to stop all study of the budget until\r\n     certain affairs of considerable importance for the welfare of\r\n     the country shall have been finally settled according to the\r\n     recommendations made by me to the Haitian Government.\r\n\r\n     \"Please accept, Mr. Secretary, the assurance of my highest\r\n     consideration,\r\n         JOHN MCILHENNY\"\r\n\r\n     Such an unanticipated and unjustifiable decision on the part of\r\n     Mr. McIlhenny, an official attached to the Ministry of Finance,\r\n     caused the whole Government profound surprise and warranted\r\n     dissatisfaction....\r\n\r\n     On July 13 the Department of Finance replied to the Financial\r\n     Adviser as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"I beg to acknowledge your letter of July 12, in which you say,\r\n     'I find myself obliged, etc....'\r\n\r\n     \"In taking note of this declaration, the importance and gravity\r\n     of which certainly cannot escape you, I can only regret in the\r\n     name of the Government:\r\n\r\n     \"1. That you omitted to tell me with the precision which such\r\n     an emergency demands what are the affairs of an importance so\r\n     considerable for the welfare of the country and the settlement\r\n     of which, according to the recommendations made by you, is of\r\n     such great moment that you can subordinate to that settlement\r\n     the continuation of the work on the budget?\r\n\r\n     \"2. That you have taken such a serious step without considering\r\n     that in so doing you have divested yourself of one of the\r\n     essential functions which devolves upon you as Financial\r\n     Adviser attached to the Department of Finance.\r\n\r\n     \"The preparation of the budget of the state constitutes one of\r\n     the principal obligations of those intrusted with it by law,\r\n     because the very life of the nation depends upon its\r\n     elaboration. The Legislature has been in session since April 5\r\n     last. By the Constitution the draft budgets and the general\r\n     accounts should be submitted to the legislative body within\r\n     eight days after the opening of the session, that is to say by\r\n     April 13. The draft budgets were sent to your office on March\r\n     22.\r\n\r\n     \"By reason of your absence from the country, the examination of\r\n     these drafts was postponed, the acting Financial Adviser not\r\n     being willing to shoulder the responsibility; we refer you to\r\n     his letters of March 29 and of April 17 and 24. Finally ... you\r\n     came back to Port-au-Prince, and after some two weeks, you\r\n     began with the secretaries to study the draft budgets.\r\n\r\n     \"The Government therefore experiences a very disagreeable\r\n     surprise on reading your letter of July 12. It becomes my duty\r\n     to inform you of that disagreeable surprise, to formulate the\r\n     legal reservations in the case, and to inform you finally that\r\n     you bear the sole responsibility for the failure to present the\r\n     budget in due time.\r\n         \"FLEURY FEQUIERE, Secretary of Finance\"\r\n\r\n     On July 19, Mr. Bailly-Blanchard, the American Minister, placed\r\n     in the hands of the President of the Republic a memorandum\r\n     emanating from Mr. McIlhenny, in which the latter formulates\r\n     against the Government complaints sufficient, according to him,\r\n     to explain and justify the discontinuance of the preparation of\r\n     the budget, announced in his letter of July 12.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Memorandum of Mr. McIlhenny_\r\n\r\n     I had instructions from the Department of State of the United\r\n     States just before my departure for Haiti, in a passage of a\r\n     letter of May 20, to declare to the Haitian Government that it\r\n     was necessary to give its immediate and formal approval:\r\n\r\n     1. To a modification of the Bank Contract agreed upon by the\r\n     Department of State and the National City Bank of New York.\r\n\r\n     2. To the transfer of the National Bank of the Republic of\r\n     Haiti to a new bank registered under the laws of Haiti to be\r\n     known as the National Bank of the Republic of Haiti.\r\n\r\n     3. To the execution of Article 15 of the Contract of\r\n     Withdrawal, prohibiting the importation and exportation of\r\n     non-Haitian money, except that which might be necessary for the\r\n     needs of commerce in the opinion of the Financial Adviser.\r\n\r\n     4. To the immediate vote of a territorial law which has been\r\n     submitted to the Department of State of the United States and\r\n     which has its approval.\r\n\r\n     On my arrival in Haiti I visited the President with the\r\n     American Minister and learned that the modifications of the\r\n     bank contract and the transfer of the bank had been agreed to\r\n     and the only reason why the measure had not been made official\r\n     was because the National City Bank and the National Bank of\r\n     Haiti had not yet presented to the Government their full\r\n     powers. He declared that the Government did not agree to the\r\n     publication of a decree executing the Contract of Withdrawal\r\n     because it did not consider that the economic condition of the\r\n     country justified it at that time. To which I replied that the\r\n     Government of the United States expected the execution of\r\n     Article 15 of the Contract of Withdrawal as a direct and solemn\r\n     engagement of the Haitian Government, to which it was a party,\r\n     and I had instructions to insist upon its being put into\r\n     execution at once....\r\n\r\n\r\n     _The Counter Memoir_\r\n\r\n     To this memorandum the Executive Authority replied by a counter\r\n     memoir which read in part as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"The modifications proposed by the Department of State [of the\r\n     United States] to the bank contract, studied by the Haitian\r\n     Government, gave rise to counter propositions on the part of\r\n     the latter, which the Department of State would not accept. The\r\n     Haitian Government then accepted these modifications in nine\r\n     articles in the form in which they had been concluded and\r\n     signed at Washington, on Friday, February 6, 1920, by the\r\n     Financial Adviser, the Haitian Minister, and the [Haitian]\r\n     Secretary of Finance. But when Messrs. Scarpa and Williams,\r\n     representing respectively and officially the National Bank of\r\n     Haiti and the National City Bank of New York, came before the\r\n     Secretary of Finance for his signature to the papers relative\r\n     to the transfer of the National Bank of Haiti to the National\r\n     City Bank of New York, the Secretary of Finance experienced a\r\n     disagreeable surprise in finding out that to Article 9 of the\r\n     document signed at Washington, February 6, 1920, and closed as\r\n     stated above, there had been added an amendment bearing on the\r\n     prohibition of non-Haitian money. The Secretary could only\r\n     decline the responsibility of this added paragraph of which he\r\n     had not the slightest knowledge and which consequently had not\r\n     been submitted to the Government for its agreement. It is for\r\n     this reason alone that the agreement is not signed up to this\r\n     time. The Government does not even yet know who was the author\r\n     of this addition to the document to which its consent had never\r\n     been asked.\"\r\n\r\n     Today, gentlemen, you have come to the end of the regular\r\n     session for this year. Four months have run by without the\r\n     Government being able to present to you the budget for\r\n     1920-1921.... Such are the facts, in brief, that have marked\r\n     our relations recently with Mr. McIlhenny....\r\n\r\n     FLEURY FEQUIERE, Secretary of Finance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Businessmen's Protest\r\n\r\n\r\nThe protest printed below, against Article 15 of the Contract of\r\nWithdrawal, was sent to the Haitian Secretary of Finance on July 30.\r\n\r\n     The undersigned bankers, merchants, and representatives of the\r\n     various branches of the financial and commercial activities in\r\n     Haiti have the honor to submit to the high appreciation of the\r\n     Secretary of State for Finance the following consideration:\r\n\r\n     They have been advised from certain sources that pressing\r\n     recommendations have been made to the Government of Haiti.\r\n\r\n     1. That a law be immediately voted by which would be prohibited\r\n     the importation or exportation of all money not Haitian, except\r\n     that quantity of foreign money which, in the opinion of the\r\n     Financial Adviser, would be sufficient for the needs of\r\n     commerce.\r\n\r\n     2. That in the charter of the Banque Nationale de la Republique\r\n     d'Haiti there be inserted an article giving power to the\r\n     Financial Adviser together with the Banque Nationale de la\r\n     Republique d'Haiti to take all measures concerning the\r\n     importation or exportation of non-Haitian monies.\r\n\r\n     The undersigned declare that the adoption of such a measure,\r\n     under whatever form it may be, would be of a nature generally\r\n     contrary to the collective interests of the Haitian people and\r\n     the industry of Haiti. It would be dangerous to substitute the\r\n     will of a single man, however eminent he might be, however\r\n     honorable, however infallible, for a natural law which\r\n     regulates the movements of the monetary circulation in a\r\n     country.\r\n\r\n     It would be more dangerous yet to introduce in the contract of\r\n     the Banque Nationale de la Republique d'Haiti a clause which\r\n     would assure this establishment a sort of monopoly in the\r\n     foreign money market, which constitutes the principal base of\r\n     the operations of high commerce, when it has already the\r\n     exclusive privilege of emission of bank notes. Such a clause\r\n     would make of all other bankers and merchants its humble\r\n     tributaries, obeying its law and its caprices....\r\n\r\n     (Signed) THE ROYAL BANK OF CANADA; AMERICAN FOREIGN BANKING\r\n     CORPORATION; HAITIAN AMERICAN SUGAR CO.; RAPOREL S.S.

BARAU, Secretary of Foreign Affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n     VII.\r\n\r\n     PORT-AU-PRINCE, August 6, 1920.\r\n\r\n     MR. A. BAILLY-BLANCHARD, American Minister\r\n\r\n     I have the honor to inclose a copy of a note from the Financial\r\n     Adviser to the Secretary of Finance, replying to a request for\r\n     information regarding the non-payment of checks....\r\n\r\n     In his reply the Financial Adviser informs the Department of\r\n     Finance that \"the payment of these salaries has been suspended\r\n     by order of the American Minister until further orders are\r\n     received from him.\"\r\n\r\n     My Government protests against this act of violence which is an\r\n     attack upon the dignity of the people and Government of Haiti.\r\n\r\n     J. BARAU, Secretary of Foreign Affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n     VIII.\r\n\r\n     PORT-AU-PRINCE, August 6, 1920.\r\n\r\n     MR. J. BARAU, Secretary of Foreign Affairs\r\n\r\n     I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of Your\r\n     Excellency's note under date of August 5.\r\n\r\n     In reply I have to state that the action of the Financial\r\n     Adviser therein referred to was taken by direction of this\r\n     Legation.\r\n\r\n     A. BAILLY-BLANCHARD, American Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n     IX.\r\n\r\n     PORT-AU-PRINCE, August 7, 1920.\r\n\r\n     MR. A. BAILLY-BLANCHARD, American Minister\r\n\r\n     In reply to my letter of August 5 in which I had the honor to\r\n     inform Your Excellency of the non-payment of checks, ... Your\r\n     Excellency informs me that it is by direction of the Legation\r\n     of the United States that the Financial Adviser acted.\r\n\r\n     My Government takes note of your declaration.\r\n\r\n     J. BARAU, Secretary of Foreign Affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Concession of the National City Bank\r\n\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with the non-payment of the July salaries of the\r\nPresident and other officials of the Haitian Republic, the Haitian\r\nMinister of Finance received from the Financial Adviser, an American,\r\nnominally a Haitian official, but acting under instructions from the\r\nAmerican Government, the following letter urging immediate ratification\r\nof a modified form of agreement between the United States Department of\r\nState and the National City Bank of New York. It was widely assumed in\r\nHaiti that this letter supplied the key to the unexplained non-payment\r\nof salaries, ordered by Mr. A. Bailly-Blanchard, the American Minister.\r\nThe letter was printed in the _Moniteur_ for August 14.\r\n\r\n    PORT-AU-PRINCE, August 2, 1920\r\n\r\n    TO THE SECRETARY OF FINANCE\r\n\r\n    I have the honor to inform you that I have been instructed by my\r\n    Government that in view of the continual delay in obtaining the\r\n    consent of the Haitian Government to the transfer to the new bank of\r\n    the modified concession as agreed upon between the Government of the\r\n    United States and the National City Bank, the Government of the\r\n    United States has agreed to let the operations of the National Bank\r\n    of the Republic of Haiti continue indefinitely on the French\r\n    contract at present existing, without amendment.\r\n\r\n    I desire urgently to draw your attention to the fact that it would\r\n    be most desirable in the interest of the Haitian people that the\r\n    Government of Haiti should give its immediate consent to the\r\n    proposed modifications of the contract and to accept the transfer of\r\n    the bank rather than see the present contract continue with its\r\n    present clauses.\r\n\r\n    JOHN MCILHENNY, Financial Adviser\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's Notes:\r\n\r\nSpelling, punctuation and capitalization has been retained as in the\r\noriginal publication except as follows:\r\n\r\nPage 27: Changed \"glaces\" to \"glaces\"\r\n\r\nPage 40: Added closing quotation mark to paragraph opening with the\r\nwords: \"And Article 2 of the American-Haitian Convention\"\r\n\r\nPage 44: Added period to end of sentence \"It is for this reason alone\r\nthat the agreement is not signed up to this time\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Self-Determining Haiti, by James Weldon Johnson",
