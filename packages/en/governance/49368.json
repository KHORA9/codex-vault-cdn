F. CLAY,\r\n\r\n  AT THE UNIVERSITY PRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese chapters are not intended to form a whole by themselves. They\r\nare merely an enlarged version of a course of lectures in which\r\nEuropean Political Institutions in general were treated historically\r\nand comparatively: and as I wish hereafter to make similar enlarged\r\nversions of the other parts of the course and to append them to what I\r\nhave here written, I hope that these chapters on the Greek Institutions\r\nmay prove to be only a first instalment of a book on Comparative\r\nPolitics. The following pages contain what their title indicates, a\r\ndescription and examination of Greek governments: but in view of the\r\nadditions which may probably be made to them, they also contain a small\r\namount of matter which is necessary as a preliminary to an examination\r\nof European governments in general.\r\n\r\nThe attention which I have paid to method and definitions of terms\r\nmight lead my readers to suppose that I conceive Comparative Politics\r\nto be a science. It is only fair to them to express the opinions\r\nthat I have formed on the matter. I do think that the part of the\r\ncomparative study of Politics, which deals with barbaric and more\r\nparticularly with non-European peoples and their governments, has been\r\nplaced on a scientific footing by Mr Herbert Spencer in his _Political\r\nInstitutions_, though he has attained this great result by a method\r\nwhich is not purely comparative, and which, as it takes no heed of\r\nhistorical sequence of events, has not stood him in good stead where\r\nhe treats of historical European communities and their constitutions.\r\nThe part--the most interesting and important part--of the study, that\r\nwhich is concerned with civilised peoples and governments, seems to me\r\nnot yet to be science. It does indeed enable us to lay down empirical\r\nrules, or rules founded solely on observation, about peoples and\r\ngovernments, just as the study of a language enables a grammarian to\r\nlay down empirical rules about words and sentences. And further, among\r\nthe rules which have been laid down, there are some, (their number is,\r\nI believe, very small,) which seem to be distinguished from the rest\r\nin two respects, firstly because they are not subject to any known\r\nexception, and secondly because some of the causes which lie at the\r\nroot of them have been discovered: and these rules have something of\r\nthe character of scientific laws, or rules which are true, not only in\r\nall known instances, but universally. But, on the other hand, most of\r\nthe rules which have as yet been laid down are of a different sort,\r\nand, either because they are vague and indefinite, or because they are\r\nsubject to many exceptions, or for other like reasons, nothing of the\r\nnature of a scientific law has been founded on them.\r\n\r\nIt is however common to all studies to be imperfect and only half\r\nconclusive while they are in their infancy: many studies, especially\r\namong those which are based on comparisons, have before now progressed\r\nwithin the lapse of a few generations from a very lowly condition to\r\nthe status of complete inductive sciences: and it is hard to see why\r\nthe same good fortune should not at some future time fall to the lot of\r\nComparative Politics.\r\n\r\nThe classification of European political bodies, which is given in my\r\nsecond chapter, was suggested to me in its main outlines by a lecture\r\nwhich I heard delivered in Cambridge many years ago by my friend Sir\r\nJohn Seeley: the usefulness of some such classification was made clear\r\nto me some years later but yet long ago by a course of lectures which\r\nwas given by another friend Professor Henry Sidgwick: and I have\r\nconstructed the classification as it stands in the second chapter with\r\nthe intention of making it serve as a framework both for what I have\r\nhere written about the Greeks and their governments and for what I\r\nhope to write hereafter about other European peoples and governments.\r\nTo both the gentlemen whom I have named I desire to express my hearty\r\nthanks for the help and guidance that their lectures have given me in\r\nmy attempts to study Politics methodically.\r\n\r\n  B.

It is not indeed probable that they are sprung from the same\r\nparents: but their ancestors once formed a group of closely associated\r\npeoples who lived beside one another as neighbours and used either\r\nthe same language or dialects of the same language. The peoples which\r\nhad in this sense a common origin comprise all those that belong to\r\nthe stocks of the Hindus, the Persians, the Celts, the Greeks, the\r\nItalians, the Teutons and the Slavs, and are known collectively as the\r\nAryans or as the Indo-European peoples.\r\n\r\nThe evidence of language not only proves that the Aryans lived together\r\nas neighbours, but also tells us something about their pursuits and\r\nhabits. From the languages of the Greeks, the Romans, the Germans and\r\nthe ancient Hindus we learn that the forefathers of these peoples\r\nbefore they left their common dwelling-place were acquainted with the\r\nmost important domestic animals and had a name for each of them: for\r\nthe words _cow_, German _Kuh_, Sanskrit _gâus_, Greek βοῦς, Latin\r\n_bos_, are mere variations from an Aryan word whose meaning they\r\nretain unaltered: the same is true of the word _ewe_, Sanskrit _avis_,\r\nGreek ὄϊς, Latin _ovis_; of _goose_, German _Gans_, Sanskrit _hansas_,\r\nGreek χήν, Latin _anser_; of _sow_, German _Sau_, Sanskrit _sû_, Greek\r\nσύς or ὕς, Latin _sus_; of _hound_, German _Hund_, Sanskrit _çvan_,\r\nGreek κύων, Latin _canis_; and of Sanskrit _açvas_, Greek ἵππος, Latin\r\n_equus_, Saxon _eoh_ or _ehu_.\r\n\r\nIn like manner the words _door_, German _Thüre_, Sanskrit _dvaras_,\r\nGreek θύρα, Latin _fores_, prove that the Aryans used a word bearing\r\nthe same meaning and therefore their dwellings were something more\r\nthan mere tents or moveable huts. _Yoke_, German _Joch_, Sanskrit\r\n_jugam_, Greek ξυγόν, Latin _jugum_, prove that they employed cattle\r\nfor draught; ἄξων, Latin _axis_, Sanskrit _akshas_ (axle and cart),\r\nOld High German _ahsa_ (axle) indicate the use of carts; the Sanskrit\r\n_nâus_, Greek ναῦς, Latin _navis_, German _Nachen_, show that they\r\ncould make boats: the Sanskrit _aritram_ (an oar or paddle[1]), Greek\r\nἐρετμός, Latin _remus_ (_resmus_), prove that they propelled them by\r\nrowing or paddling. The absence however of common words for a mast, a\r\nsail, the sea, indicate that the waters that they knew were rivers or\r\nsmall lakes and that they did not possess the art of getting propulsion\r\nfrom the wind[2].\r\n\r\n  [1] See Curtius, _Grundzüge der Griechischen Etymologie_, under the\r\n  word ἀρόω.\r\n\r\n  [2] The evidence derived from comparison of the Greek, Latin\r\n  and Sanskrit is taken from Mommsen, _History of Rome_, English\r\n  translation, vol. I. p. 15: the additional evidence from German\r\n  languages from Max Müller, _Chips from a German Workshop_, vol. II.\r\n  pp. 22, 44. Curtius, _Grundzüge der Griechischen Etymologie_, has been\r\n  used for verification.\r\n\r\nThe Aryans were not entirely ignorant of plants that produce corn: for\r\nthere was an Aryan word from which are descended the Sanskrit _yavas_\r\n(barley), the Greek ζειά (spelt, a kind of grain) and _jáva_ in Zend\r\n(or Old Persian), Slavic and Lithuanian. Mommsen, noticing only the\r\nSanskrit and the Greek, and observing the difference of meaning, thinks\r\nthat the Aryans while they were all together merely gathered and ate\r\nthe grains of barley and spelt that grew wild. A recent English writer\r\npoints out the wide diffusion of the words descended from the Aryan\r\nword, and thinks it could not have left traces of its existence in\r\nso many languages unless corn had been cultivated by the Aryans and\r\nhad thus become well known to them[3]. This inference seems to be\r\nfair: but the absence of traces of other original Aryan words for\r\nagricultural products or instruments shows clearly that agriculture\r\nplayed only a subordinate part in their economy. It is probable that\r\nthey sowed some kind of grain in little plots of ground that scarcely\r\nneeded tillage.\r\n\r\n  [3] Mommsen, _Hist. Rome_, vol. I. p. 16. Rendall, _The Cradle of the\r\n  Aryans_, p. 11.\r\n\r\nThe results of the evidence which has been adduced may be summed up by\r\nsaying that the forefathers of the Greeks, Romans, Germans and Hindus,\r\nwhile they still occupied their common Aryan home, lived not in tents\r\nbut in houses with doors, and were therefore not mere wanderers but had\r\nmore or less permanent abodes: they were not savages dependent on wild\r\nanimals and wild fruits for subsistence, but had sheep and cattle to\r\nsupply them with flesh and milk: they had carts on wheels and knew how\r\nto yoke their oxen and horses: they made boats and propelled them on\r\ntheir rivers or lakes with oars or paddles: and they were acquainted\r\nwith some kinds of grain, but were either ignorant of agriculture or\r\ncared little for it.\r\n\r\nFrom the condition in which the Aryans lived we may safely infer that\r\nthey were not totally devoid of political institutions. All men live\r\nunder government except a few to whom government is either impossible\r\nor useless. The multitude of uncivilised races who inhabit or have\r\ninhabited the earth may be divided into two great classes; the first\r\nand lower class consisting of those who depend for subsistence solely\r\non wild plants and wild animals, the second and upper class comprising\r\nall those who, in addition to the wild fruits that they may gather and\r\nthe wild animals that they may kill, also have tame cattle to supply\r\nthem with flesh and milk or cultivated plants that produce grain. The\r\nlower class are known either as savages or as hunting peoples: the\r\nupper, for want of a better name, may be designated as barbarians. In\r\nthe lower class, the savages and hunting peoples, a very small number\r\nof peoples are found who have been prevented by specially adverse\r\ncircumstances from having any governments: but in the rest of the lower\r\nclass and in all the upper class of uncivilised peoples the existence\r\nof some kind of government is universal.\r\n\r\nIn illustration and proof of these statements some facts may be cited.\r\nThe Bushmen of South Africa were at the beginning of the present\r\ncentury a race of savages who wandered over an arid sloping plain that\r\nlies to the South of the Orange River. They just contrived to maintain\r\na miserable existence on the roots that they could grub up and on the\r\nflesh of animals that they shot with poisoned arrows or entrapped in\r\npitfalls: but, as every family was compelled to keep itself isolated\r\nfrom all neighbours in order to have enough to eat, government was\r\nimpossible. Other races resembling the Bushmen in the isolation of\r\ntheir families and in having no government are the Rock Veddahs in\r\nCeylon and the Digger Indians in California. A slightly different case\r\noccurs in the regions near the North Pole. The Esquimaux, who live\r\nby catching seals and other marine animals, are not precluded from\r\ngrouping their huts in small clusters: but nature offers so little\r\nreward to any combined effort of a large number of men that they have\r\nnever cared to form political communities: and they afford perhaps\r\nthe only example of human beings living as neighbours but without\r\ngovernment. Leaving these very exceptional cases, we next observe a\r\ngroup of hunting peoples with whom nature dealt less unkindly. Some\r\nforty years ago, almost the only inhabitants of the western part of\r\nBritish North America, now known as Manitoba, were a number of Red\r\nIndian tribes who supported themselves entirely by the chase, killing\r\nbuffalo for food and other animals for their furs, which they passed on\r\nto traders in return for such commodities as the traders brought them.\r\nDuring the greater part of the year each Red Indian family wandered\r\nalmost as much apart from communication with mankind as did the\r\nBushmen, for so the wild animals could most advantageously be pursued:\r\nand of course while they remained in dispersion had no government.\r\nBut at certain seasons in every year a whole tribe came together for\r\na great buffalo hunt: at other times they assembled to organize a war\r\nagainst some neighbouring tribe: and whenever they met for either\r\npurpose they subjected themselves to an efficient government, which\r\nincluded even a system of police. Apart from the groups of peoples whom\r\nI have mentioned, no great number of savage peoples seems to have been\r\nobserved in recent times: the New Zealanders when first the Europeans\r\nwent among them were savages and cannibals, and yet they lived under\r\nwell established kingly governments.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the upper class of uncivilised peoples, the barbarians,\r\nwho either keep cattle or grow corn or do both, it will suffice to\r\nsay that observation of all of them (and they are extremely numerous)\r\nproves that all of them have governments. Nor is the fact hard to\r\nunderstand: for in their case it is never necessary for single families\r\nto live in isolation: they do as a matter of fact live collected\r\ntogether in groups of families, and each group gains numberless\r\nadvantages by living together and acting together: and, where men live\r\ntogether and act together, government naturally comes into existence.\r\nThose of the barbarian peoples who, like the Aryans, have more or less\r\nfixed abodes, always group themselves in small independent tribes\r\nand adopt such simple forms of government as are suited to their\r\ncircumstances. There are many different kinds of tribal governments.\r\nIn nearly all of them a small number of men distinguished for prowess\r\ndaring or intelligence have some authority over the rest: sometimes\r\nabove these chiefs there is a higher chief or king: and sometimes the\r\nwhole body of warriors may be called together to hear what the chiefs\r\nhave to say to them. Among the ancient Aryans all the governments were\r\nno doubt tribal governments: but it is impossible to say that any one\r\nof the various kinds of tribal governments prevailed to the exclusion\r\nof the rest[4].\r\n\r\n  [4] The classification of uncivilised peoples as hunting peoples\r\n  and peoples with cattle forms part of the classification used by\r\n  John Stuart Mill at the beginning of his _Political Economy_: and it\r\n  is adopted and fully worked out by Mr Lewis Morgan in his _Ancient\r\n  Society_.\r\n\r\n  All the statements of a general kind which I have made about\r\n  uncivilised peoples have been verified by reference to _Descriptive\r\n  Sociology, Division I._, an encyclopædia of facts relating to such\r\n  peoples, which was designed by Mr Herbert Spencer and compiled by\r\n  Professor Duncan. The advantages which uncivilised men gain from\r\n  living and acting together and from having a government are explained\r\n  by Mr Herbert Spencer in his _Political Institutions_, §§ 440-442.\r\n\r\n  My authorities for the individual peoples which have been noticed are\r\n  these: for the Bushmen, Burchell, _Travels_ (1822), and Thompson,\r\n  _Travels_ (1827): for the Esquimaux, C. F. Hall, _Life with the\r\n  Esquimaux_ (1864): for the Red Indians, H. Y. Hind, _The Canadian\r\n  Red River Exploring Expedition_ (1860). All these books are cited in\r\n  _Descriptive Sociology_.\r\n\r\nWhen the Aryans had made such progress as I have described they divided\r\ninto two groups: one group contained the forefathers of the Europeans,\r\nthe other the forefathers of the Hindus and Persians. Whether the\r\nseparation arose through a migration of only the Europeans or of only\r\nthe Asiatics or from migrations of both Europeans and Asiatics cannot\r\nbe determined. It is certain however that after the division of the\r\nstocks took place the Europeans still remained together long enough\r\nto acquire in common the art of ploughing. The English word to _ear_,\r\nAnglo-Saxon _erian_, Gothic _erjan_, Old High German _eren_, Latin\r\n_arare_, Greek ἀρόειν, Irish _araim_ (I plough) are mere variations\r\nof a single word and show that when ploughing was introduced the\r\nEuropean stocks were still in close neighbourhood with one another and\r\nall adopted dialectic varieties of the same sound to indicate the new\r\nmethod of breaking up the soil[5].\r\n\r\n  [5] It may be objected that the Goths from about 250 A.D. were living\r\n  close to the Greeks, and the Old Germans from about 50 B.C. had the\r\n  Romans as their neighbours, and possibly learned the art of ploughing\r\n  from these neighbours and borrowed a name for it. It seems enough,\r\n  however, to answer that if the Goths had taken a word from ἀρόειν they\r\n  would have chosen something more like the pattern word than _erjan_:\r\n  in like manner if the Germans had borrowed from _arare_ they would\r\n  hardly have formed _eren_.\r\n\r\nThe region in which the forefathers of the Europeans lived together\r\ncannot be precisely ascertained: the hypothesis that it was in central\r\nEurope seems to fit in best with the geographical distribution of their\r\ndescendants and the relationships between their languages.\r\n\r\nThe invention of the art of ploughing opened new possibilities for the\r\nEuropean peoples: for an agricultural people has far better chances\r\nthan a people of herdsmen of accumulating wealth and making progress\r\nin the useful arts. But not all of them cared to make use of the new\r\nart and to become tillers of the soil. Those who took their homes amid\r\nthe forests of central Europe still continued the life of hunters and\r\nherdsmen which had once been common to all the Aryans. Others devoted\r\nthemselves to agricultural pursuits with delight and success: and among\r\nthem were those who settled in the peninsulas of Greece and Italy,\r\nwhere, favoured by many circumstances, they made comparatively rapid\r\nprogress in arts, knowledge and political development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nA CLASSIFICATION OF EUROPEAN POLITICAL BODIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject matter of the study of politics consists firstly of the\r\ngroups or collections of men who have lived under governments, and\r\nsecondly of the governments under which they have lived. In the present\r\nchapter I wish to speak of the groups, to describe in outline the\r\nvarious forms which they have taken, and to define the names by which\r\ntheir forms are severally known. I must premise that I shall call some\r\nof the groups political communities, meaning by a political community\r\na number of persons living under one government and also having much\r\nelse in common besides government: the rest I shall call political\r\naggregates, meaning by a political aggregate a number of persons or\r\nbodies of persons living under one government and having nothing\r\nelse or very little else in common. Having said this, I can proceed\r\nto notice the forms of individual communities or aggregates, with a\r\nview to classifying them according to their forms. In my survey the\r\nearliest forms will be taken first, and the others afterwards, as far\r\nas possible in chronological order[6].\r\n\r\n  [6] I have thought it needless in most cases to give authorities for\r\n  statements of historical facts made in this chapter, because the\r\n  statements are generally such that it is very easy to settle whether\r\n  they are true or false. In cases where verification might be in the\r\n  least degree difficult I have given references.\r\n\r\nThe two European races into whose past we can grope our way farthest\r\nback are the Germans and the Greeks. Each of these races, when first\r\nwe have any knowledge of them, had formed a large number of tribes or\r\nsmall primitive political communities. The German tribes in the times\r\nof Cæsar and of Tacitus and the Greek tribes in the time of Homer were\r\nalike in being of small size and in being primitive in their habits and\r\ngovernment: but in a German tribe the whole population lived scattered\r\nover the open country and there was no walled city, while in a Greek\r\ntribe, though most of the people lived in the open country, there was\r\na walled city as a centre for the community and a dwelling place for a\r\nfew of the most important tribesmen. It is desirable to give the word\r\n_tribe_ such a definition as will emphasize the distinction between a\r\ntribe and a city, and I shall therefore define it as meaning a small\r\nprimitive political community, living in the open country without any\r\nwalled city. From this definition it follows that I must regard the\r\nGerman tribes alone as being perfect specimens of the genus tribe or as\r\nbeing tribes pure and simple: the early Greek communities, though for\r\nbrevity I shall speak of them as tribes, ought in strict accuracy to be\r\nregarded as tribes which were on the way to become cities and which had\r\nalready acquired some small portion of the qualities by which cities\r\nare characterized.\r\n\r\nIn Greece tribes were succeeded by cities, that is to say small\r\ncommunities in which a walled city is everything, and the country\r\ndistricts are of little importance: and similar communities arose also\r\nin Italy. The cities of ancient Greece and Italy are often further\r\ndesignated as city-states, and the name is rightly applied to them: for\r\nthey were not only cities in the sense which I have given to the word,\r\nbut were also states because each of them was an independent community\r\nwith a government of its own.\r\n\r\nBut the cities of ancient Greece and Italy were not all alike: the\r\nGreek cities were inexpansive: in Italy one city expanded itself by\r\nconquering a host of other cities and absorbing their populations into\r\nits own body politic. The contrast between the inexpansive cities of\r\nGreece and the expansive city of Rome is a matter of which I hope some\r\ntime to speak at length: for the present it will suffice to notice\r\nthat the Athenians, the largest political community known to Greek\r\nhistory in the age of the city states (that is to say before 338 B.C.),\r\ninhabited a territory of less area than an average English county:\r\nwhile in Italy before the beginning of the second Punic war (218 B.C.)\r\ntowns or fortresses peopled by fully qualified citizens of the Roman\r\nRepublic were to be found scattered over all the central region from\r\nSena Gallica in Umbria to Sinuessa in Campania, and other towns or\r\nfortresses whose inhabitants possessed the private but not the public\r\nrights of Roman citizens existed in all parts of the peninsula[7]. It\r\nmust however be observed that Rome did not by its expansion lose the\r\ndistinguishing characteristics of a city state: it still continued\r\nafter its expansion over all Italy to be a community in which a single\r\ncity was of supreme importance and the population remote from the city\r\nwas, politically at least, of little moment: but as it was incomparably\r\nlarger than any ordinary city state, we must call it not simply a city\r\nstate but an enlarged or expanded city state.\r\n\r\n  [7] Marquardt, _Römische Staatsverwaltung_, Vol. I. pages 22-57, in\r\n  the edition of 1873, comprising the section headed _Italien vor der\r\n  lex Julia_. Mommsen, _History of Rome_, Vol. II., especially the\r\n  _Military Map of Italy_ at the beginning of the volume.\r\n\r\nThe small size of the Greek cities and their incapacity for acting in\r\nconcert led to their subjugation by Macedonia in 338 B.C. About sixty\r\nor eighty years later many of them had recovered their independence,\r\nand some of them, in order to guard against a second conquest by\r\nMacedonia, joined together in a league or federation. The union of\r\nmany communities in a federation was not a new thing in Greek history:\r\nduring several centuries that preceded the year 338 B.C. some obscure\r\ntribes of mountaineers (the Achæans) had lived in such a union; their\r\nleague had been broken up by the Macedonian conquerors, but they had\r\nbeen able, about 281 B.C., to reconstitute it: and the Greek cities,\r\nwhen they began, about 251 B.C., to see their need of mutual defence,\r\nhad the Achæan League ready at hand, and were able to gain what they\r\nneeded by enrolling themselves among its members. The Achæan League,\r\nenlarged by the admission of many important cities, was a federal\r\nstate: that is to say, it was a community in which each city or canton\r\nhad a government of its own for most purposes, but the federation or\r\nunion of cities and cantons had also a common government for those\r\nmatters which most nearly concerned the safety of them all. The League\r\nwas perfectly successful till 221 B.C. in attaining the ends for which\r\nit had been established, and is remarkable as furnishing the first\r\nexample in history of a well organized federal state[8].\r\n\r\n  [8] For details see Chapter VII.\r\n\r\nThe Romans employed the strength, which they had acquired through their\r\nconquest of Italy and their success in the second Punic war, in getting\r\npossession of many distant territories inhabited by alien races. Before\r\n146 B.C. they were masters of Macedonia, part of Asia Minor, Spain and\r\nnorthern Africa, and the Roman dominions presented an example of a\r\nmere political aggregate, or heterogeneous empire or number of peoples\r\nhaving no natural attraction for one another and held together only by\r\nforce. For the rule of a heterogeneous empire the institutions of a\r\ncity and even of an expanded city proved utterly unsuitable: and it was\r\nnecessary that both the conquering city and the dominions which it had\r\nconquered should submit to be ruled under a centralised and despotic\r\nsystem of government adapted to the needs of a heterogeneous empire.\r\nThe right system was only gradually made, but it had been completed by\r\nthe death of the Emperor Constantine the Great in 337 A.D.\r\n\r\nBut it is time to return to the Germans: for the Germans were the\r\nsuccessors of the Romans as masters of Western Europe. The Germans in\r\ntheir primitive tribal condition possessed a great aptitude for forming\r\nlarge political communities by the union of many small communities:--an\r\naptitude which is probably common to all peoples in a tribal\r\ncondition:--and they inhabited a flat country which put no obstacles\r\nin the way of the amalgamation of their tribes. At any rate the German\r\ntribes between 150 A.D. and 400 A.D. were engaged in a process of\r\namalgamation. About 150 A.D. Ptolemy enumerated more than fifty of\r\nthem[9]: by the year 400 all or nearly all of these had gathered\r\nthemselves into a few great hordes or associations of tribes, (which\r\nmay themselves be called overgrown tribes,) bearing severally the names\r\nof the Saxons, the Salian Franks, the Ripuarian Franks, the Angli, the\r\nAlamanni, the Burgundians, the Visigoths, the Ostrogoths, the Lombards.\r\nAfter 400 A.D. came the great migrations of the German peoples: some\r\nof them invaded the provinces of the Western Roman Empire, still full\r\nof wealth and of such civilisation as the Romans had planted there:\r\nothers, in the second half of the fifth century, betook themselves to\r\nBritain, from whence the Romans had departed in the year 407.\r\n\r\n  [9] Smith's _Atlas of Ancient Geography_, Map 13, contains a map of\r\n  Germania Magna according to Ptolemy.\r\n\r\nDuring the eleven centuries which intervened between the migrations of\r\nthe Germans and the year 1500, the Germans who went to Britain, Spain\r\nand Gaul succeeded in forming certain large political communities which\r\nare usually known as the nations of medieval Europe. These political\r\ncommunities as they existed about the year 1480 or 1500 possessed three\r\nof the distinguishing features of nations: for each of them was of\r\nlarge size, lived under a single government, and was composed of men\r\nwell suited for living together and under one government: but all of\r\nthem lacked one quality which is essential for the making of a perfect\r\nnation: and that lacking quality was a strong cohesion between the\r\ninhabitants of the different parts of their territories. But it will\r\nbe necessary to observe in detail the processes by which the large\r\npolitical communities were built up.\r\n\r\nThe Saxons, Angles, and Jutes who went to Britain established\r\nthemselves at first in a number of small settlements on its southern\r\nand eastern coasts. From these settlements they gradually pushed their\r\nway inland, and by 577 A.D. they had conquered nearly all the richest\r\nand most fertile regions in Britain. The many political communities\r\nformed by settlement and conquest were soon afterwards engaged in\r\nstrife with one another: in the beginning of the ninth century the\r\nWest Saxons overpowered all their opponents and the West Saxon king\r\nreceived the submission of all the German settlers in the island. The\r\nconquering West Saxons and the conquered Angles and Jutes showed the\r\nsame genius for amalgamation as had been shown by their forefathers in\r\nGermany long before: and by the middle of the ninth century all the\r\nGermans in Britain (we may now call them the English) had combined\r\ninto a single large political community. Three times over, in 867-878,\r\n988-1016, and 1066-1070, the English were disturbed by invasions of\r\nfresh immigrants from the continent of Europe: but on each occasion the\r\nnew comers were successfully united in a single political community\r\nwith the older settlers, and by the year 1174 or at any rate by 1215\r\nthe English people had been for the last time fashioned into one\r\nkindred under one government.\r\n\r\nThe German peoples who invaded Spain were the Vandals, the Alans, the\r\nSuevi and the Visigoths. The Visigoths proved to be the strongest of\r\nthe four, and by the early years of the sixth century they had occupied\r\nnearly all the peninsula except the north east corner, which they\r\nleft to the Suevi. In the enjoyment of the luxuries afforded by Roman\r\ncivilisation, and in the fancied security of their position, they\r\nneglected the arts of war in which they had once so greatly excelled.\r\nIn 710 A.D. their country was invaded and in the three following years\r\nwas conquered by Moors from Africa, so that none of it was left to the\r\nGoths, the Suevi and some other tribes who were neither Germans nor\r\nMoors, except some valleys among the Pyrenees and a narrow strip of\r\nland about twenty miles broad and two hundred miles long between the\r\nshore of the Bay of Biscay and the mountain range of Cantabria and\r\nAsturias[10].\r\n\r\n  [10] Spruner-Menke, _Historischer Hand-Atlas_, _Maps_ 14 _and_ 15.\r\n\r\nDuring the five centuries which followed the Moorish conquest of\r\nSpain the Goths who lived on the shores of the Bay of Biscay and the\r\ninhabitants of the southern valleys of the Pyrenees gradually expanded\r\nby reconquering territory from the Moors, and before the middle of\r\nthe twelfth century had formed the two large political communities of\r\nCastile and Arragon[11]. Each of these communities during its long\r\ncontest with the Moors had acquired habits, thoughts and institutions\r\nof its own, and they were but little inclined to join themselves\r\ntogether into a single nation. The marriage of Ferdinand of Arragon\r\nwith Isabella of Castile in 1469 produced as its result some time later\r\nthat both Castile and Arragon were ruled by the same government: but\r\ndifferences and jealousies between the two peoples continued to exist\r\nlong afterwards, even so late as the War of the Spanish Succession in\r\nthe eighteenth century[12], and it may well be doubted whether the two\r\nwere ever welded together into a single Spanish nation until after the\r\nterrible misfortunes which they endured and the great efforts which\r\nthey made in a common cause during their war against Napoleon.\r\n\r\n  [11] Hallam, _Middle Ages_, Chapter IV.\r\n\r\n  [12] Stanhope, _Reign of Queen Anne_, Vol. I. p. 264.\r\n\r\nIn Gaul the formation of a large political community was delayed till\r\nlate in the middle ages; in Germany, the original home of the Germans,\r\nno large political community of great importance was established till\r\nlate in the seventeenth century. In both countries the same hindrances\r\nstood in the way of the making of great communities. The two countries\r\nwere included in the heterogeneous empires founded between 687 A.D. and\r\n800 A.D. by the house of Pepin, especially by Charlemagne, the greatest\r\nman of the house of Pepin: in that empire, as in all heterogeneous\r\nempires, it was found necessary that the central ruler should delegate\r\nvery great powers to the officials who governed provinces or districts:\r\nand under the circumstances of the time it was also found convenient\r\nfor him to grant large estates of land to men who had been useful to\r\nhim and could be trusted to serve him well in the future. In 843 Gaul\r\n(or the land of the West Franks) was severed from the empire, and\r\nset up a king of its own, who pretended to have the same powers as\r\nCharlemagne had exercised. But the kings of the West Franks could not\r\ncontrol the local officials and landowners: by the eleventh century\r\nthe local officials and the landowners had converted themselves into\r\nindependent sovereigns, each ruling his own lands and the men who\r\nlived on his lands: that particular landowner who still enjoyed the\r\ntitle of king had no authority (or at any rate no authority which he\r\ncould habitually exercise) except within the lands which specially\r\nbelonged to him: and even within his own lands he, like the other\r\nlandowners in Gaul, found that his authority was often disputed in arms\r\nby his tenants.\r\n\r\nIn the early years of the twelfth century Louis VI., owning or claiming\r\nto own an estate or demesne of land which had Paris as its centre and\r\nmeasured about 140 miles from north to south and about 50 miles from\r\neast to west, set himself to establish order and government within\r\nhis demesne by force of arms. The inhabitants of the demesne valued\r\nthe good government and the order that was maintained among them by\r\nLouis VI. and his grandson Philip II., and when the twelfth century\r\nended they may be counted as forming a small political community or a\r\nbody of men, possessing not only a common government, but also common\r\ninterests habits and wishes[13]. In the thirteenth century the king's\r\ndemesne was increased by the acquisition of Normandy, Anjou, Maine,\r\nTouraine, Poitou, Champagne in the north of Gaul, and by the distant\r\nregion of Languedoc in the south. The new parts of the demesne were\r\nplaced under the same government with the old, and no doubt those of\r\nthem which lay together in the north of Gaul constantly tended to\r\nunite themselves into a single political community. But the work of\r\nunification was greatly impeded by causes all closely connected with\r\nthe independence which the different parts of Gaul had possessed in the\r\ntenth and eleventh centuries, and it had not made very great progress\r\nin 1415 when France was invaded by the armies of the English. After the\r\nexpulsion of the invaders the work was taken up again and carried on\r\nwith better success by Charles VII., Louis XI. and the later kings of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n  [13] My statements about Frankish and early French history down to the\r\n  reign of Philip II. are all based on original authorities: but see\r\n  Kitchin, _History of France_, Vol. I., and some excellent maps (No.\r\n  57) in Droysen, _Historischer Hand-Atlas_.\r\n\r\nIn Germany events followed much the same course as in Gaul; but they\r\noccurred later. The extinction of the Emperor's authority and the rise\r\nof the local governors and landowners to independence did not come to\r\npass in Germany till the middle of the thirteenth century; and none of\r\nthe princes who then gained their independence succeeded during the\r\nmiddle ages in rising to preeminence above the rest.\r\n\r\nIn order to complete our survey of the chief political communities\r\nof the middle ages we must glance at northern Italy and Switzerland.\r\nNorthern Italy contained many important towns which had been founded\r\nby the Romans: during the early part of the middle ages it became the\r\ncommercial centre of Europe: the towns grew in wealth and influence,\r\nand before the year 1200 they succeeded in making themselves\r\nindependent, and constituted themselves as city states, resembling\r\nthe city states of ancient Greece. In Switzerland three tribes of\r\nmountaineers in Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden, in 1291, agreed to form a\r\nleague or permanent alliance, which was afterwards joined by many of\r\ntheir neighbours, though no steps towards forming a federal state were\r\ntaken till about the year 1500[14].\r\n\r\n  [14] Oechsli, _Quellenbuch zur Schweizergeschichte_, pages 49,\r\n  199-202, 261-266. The second of these passages, especially page 200,\r\n  proves that so late as 1481 no Swiss Federation had been made, but\r\n  each canton was an independent state, managing its foreign relations\r\n  for itself: the third shows that by 1512 a central body had been\r\n  established which received ambassadors sent by foreign powers to the\r\n  Swiss, and settled what answers the Swiss League should give them.\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked already that the large political communities of\r\nthe middle ages were not thoroughly coherent or consolidated. A want of\r\ncoherence was exhibited both in France and in England by the frequent\r\nrecurrence of rebellions or civil strife, in France under John II.\r\nand Charles VI., in England under Edward II., Richard II. and Henry\r\nVI.; still more clearly was it made visible in France in 1356-1360 and\r\n1415-1422 by the inability of the French to act unitedly in resistance\r\nto an invading enemy, and by the ease with which portions of French\r\nterritory were detached from the dominions of the French king and\r\ntransferred to the victorious invaders. The danger of civil discord\r\nwas great enough in the fifteenth century when it arose mainly from\r\nthe armies of retainers kept by ambitious noblemen: but it became\r\nstill greater in the sixteenth, when differences of creed divided\r\neach people into two hostile camps. The disruptive forces at length\r\nbecame so strong that both France and England seemed to be in danger\r\nof losing the character of political communities and of lapsing into\r\nmasses of heterogeneous elements; and accordingly each country adopted\r\nthat kind of government which is best suited to hold heterogeneous\r\nelements together, namely, a monarchy with almost unlimited power.\r\nThe subsequent histories of the two countries, though dissimilar in\r\ngeneral character, were in one respect alike: in both countries civil\r\nwar actually occurred, in France in the sixteenth century, in England\r\nin the seventeenth; and in each country experience of the miseries of\r\nwar brought a love for the blessings of peace, with the result that\r\nFrance from 1700 to 1789 and England from 1745 to this day present very\r\nperfect examples of united nations.\r\n\r\nBesides the nations of France, England, Spain, Scotland, Sweden, Norway\r\nand Denmark which grew up directly from the large political communities\r\nof the middle ages, others have been founded in more recent times,\r\nsome of them having only a single government, and being therefore\r\ncalled unitary states, and others having one government for some\r\npurposes and many governments for other purposes, and being known as\r\nfederal states. Among the unitary or non-federal nations we must notice\r\nBrandenburg-Prussia 1700-1866, Italy since 1859, Belgium, Holland,\r\nGreece, and the Balkan States: among the federal nations the United\r\nStates of America and modern Switzerland stand out conspicuously. The\r\nGerman Empire founded in 1871 is a federal nation, though it differs\r\nfrom other federal nations because Prussia, one of its component\r\nstates, is larger than all the other component states put together:\r\nAustria Hungary was for centuries a mere heterogeneous empire, but in\r\nrecent times its parts have been held together by the possession of\r\ncommon interests and not by force, so that it has acquired some of the\r\ncharacters of a federation, though it cannot be said that it has grown\r\ntogether into a single nation.\r\n\r\nBut the making and consolidation of nations is not the only kind of\r\nstate-building that has gone on since the end of the middle ages:\r\nfor other sorts of construction have also been actively carried on,\r\nand they have resulted in the making of a number of states that are\r\nlarger than nations. In some cases two European nations or a European\r\nnation and some other European population have been brought under a\r\nsingle government: in other cases a European nation has expanded by the\r\nfoundation of colonies far away from its original abode: and yet again\r\nin some cases a European state has conquered a host of non-European\r\npeoples and formed them into a heterogeneous empire dependent on itself.\r\n\r\nThe most conspicuous instances of the union of a nation with another\r\nnation or people occurred in 1683 when Alsace was acquired by France,\r\nin 1707 when England and Scotland placed themselves under one\r\ngovernment, in 1771, 1793 and 1795 when parts of Poland were annexed\r\nto Prussia, and in 1801 when the United Kingdom of Great Britain and\r\nIreland was formed. The enlarged states which result from such unions\r\ncan never be strictly called single nations immediately after the union\r\nhas taken place, and for a time at least after the union they must be\r\ndenoted merely as unitary states: but usually they have not for most\r\npurposes differed very greatly from nations: for in all cases one of\r\nthe two peoples united together has been a large and well consolidated\r\nnation and the other has been much smaller and far less perfectly\r\norganized: and consequently the larger partner in the union has had a\r\npredominant share in the government, and has gradually succeeded in\r\ncommunicating its own national characteristics and feelings to some\r\npart at least of the population of the lesser partner in the union.\r\n\r\nA state formed by colonial expansion presents difficulties to any one\r\nwho tries to define its nature. It is like a family of plants all\r\nsprung from one stock; the stock has sent out offshoots, which have\r\nthemselves struck root, but are still connected with the parent stock\r\nfrom which they sprang. In one sense such an expanded state is still a\r\nsingle political community: in another sense each of the colonies which\r\nbelongs to it is also a political community, though it never possesses\r\ncomplete independence, and therefore is not to be counted as a state.\r\n\r\nThe greatest conquerors of distant lands outside Europe have been\r\nthe Spaniards, the English and the Russians. Their conquests formed\r\nthree great political aggregates or heterogeneous empires, the Spanish\r\nEmpire in southern and central America, the Indian Empire, and the\r\nRussian Empire. The Indian and the Russian Empires are administered by\r\nmethods more or less resembling those used in the old heterogeneous\r\nEmpire of the Romans by Constantine the Great and his successors: the\r\nadministration of the Spaniards was very defective from the outset, and\r\nat the beginning of the nineteenth century their empire broke up into a\r\nnumber of independent states.\r\n\r\nAnd now I may attempt a classification of all the more important forms\r\nthat have been assumed by groups or collections of men living under\r\ngovernments. First of all, some of these groups are mere political\r\naggregates, having little in common save the fact of living under one\r\ngovernment, and the rest are political communities whose members have\r\nmuch else beside government in common. The mere aggregates will not\r\nneed to be further divided; they are all heterogeneous empires held\r\ntogether by force. The political communities must be divided into three\r\nclasses, tribes, cities, and the larger political communities. The\r\nclass tribes needs no subdivision: cities must be divided according as\r\nthey are inexpansive or expansive: the larger political communities (a\r\nclass identical with the nations and those communities which possess\r\nmany of the qualities of nations) need be subdivided only into unitary\r\nstates or large political communities each with a single government\r\nonly, and federal states or large political communities in which there\r\nis one government for some purposes and many governments for other\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nThe essentials of a perfect classification are four in number. Firstly,\r\nit ought to be exhaustive or to comprehend all individual specimens, so\r\nthat no individual shall be without a place in it. Secondly, the marks\r\nwhich distinguish the classes should be easily recognisable. Thirdly,\r\nthe marks of one class should never be present in a single individual\r\ntogether with the marks of another: for, if they are, the individual is\r\nin two classes at once. Fourthly (and this is most essential of all),\r\nthe classes should be such that many important general propositions are\r\ntrue of all the individuals which compose any given class.\r\n\r\nIt will be well to try to ascertain in what measure these essentials\r\nare found in a classification of European bodies politic under the five\r\nheads of tribes, cities, nations unitary and federal, and heterogeneous\r\nempires. Firstly, the classification is, I believe, so far exhaustive\r\nthat it includes all those bodies which most clearly deserve to be\r\ncalled both political and European: it does not however provide a\r\nplace for mere feudal principalities which never grew into nations,\r\nnor is it intended to include the Asiatic Empire of the Turks in\r\nEurope. Secondly, the marks which distinguish the classes are easily\r\nrecognisable. Thirdly, the classification is decidedly imperfect\r\nbecause it does not make it impossible for a political body to be in\r\ntwo classes at once. But the possibility that a political body may be\r\nin two classes at once does not occur except during those periods when\r\na community is gradually growing out of one form and into another. Such\r\nperiods of transition have occurred in the history of many peoples:\r\nthere was one in Greek history when the tribes were growing into\r\ncities: one in Roman history when the Republic was ceasing to be a mere\r\nenlarged city and was growing into a heterogeneous empire: and one in\r\nEnglish history when the English were losing the character of a tribe\r\nand acquiring the qualities of a nation. But such periods of transition\r\ndo not occur in the life of all peoples, and where they do occur,\r\nthey are not usually of long duration when compared with the whole\r\nof the people's history. Fourthly, there are many important general\r\npropositions which are true of all or of nearly all the individuals in\r\nany given class. To establish such general propositions by historical\r\nevidence will be my task in the present chapters and in any future\r\nadditions which I may be able to make to them. Some of these general\r\npropositions may be at once indicated in an imperfect form, though the\r\nproofs of them must be postponed.\r\n\r\nThe most important of these propositions are those which assert that\r\nthere is an intimate connexion between the form of a political body\r\nand the form of government by which it is ruled: and that each of the\r\nforms that a political body can assume has a certain type or certain\r\ntypes of government commonly and almost uniformly associated with it.\r\nThe propositions may be set down in the following way. Firstly, all\r\nthe tribes of which we have any good records have had governments not\r\ndiffering from one another in any important particular. Secondly,\r\ncities pure and simple or inexpansive cities have usually three kinds\r\nof government only, pure oligarchy, or pure despotism, or direct and\r\nalmost unmixed democracy: and Republican Rome, the single example\r\nof an expanded city, had a government peculiar to itself. Thirdly,\r\nin the large unitary states or nations, it is, roughly speaking,\r\ntrue that three kinds of government have succeeded one another in\r\nregular sequence: at first, during the middle ages, they were under\r\ngovernments in which power belonged partly to a king and partly to an\r\nassembly of estates, the assembly consisting usually of the nobles,\r\nthe prelates of the church, and representatives from rural districts\r\nand towns: afterwards, when they were in danger of disruption, they\r\nplaced themselves under monarchies of unlimited or almost unlimited\r\npower, and these monarchies usually continued to exist after all\r\ndanger of disruption had been removed: and now, in modern times, all\r\nunitary states are ruled by cabinets under the control or supervision\r\nof popular representative assemblies. Turning to federal states,\r\nwhich form the fourth class of political communities, we find that\r\nall of them are alike in having a central government both legislative\r\nand executive, whose sphere of action is strictly limited by the\r\nconstitution to certain portions of the work of governing, and in\r\npermitting each of the states, which are joined together in the\r\nfederation, also to have a government of its own, which controls all\r\nbusiness except that portion which is allotted by the constitution to\r\nthe central government of the federation. And, lastly, heterogeneous\r\nempires must, unless they are to break in pieces, have governments\r\nwhose chief object is centralisation. Supreme power may belong to a\r\ndespotic monarch or to a small body of men appointed by a foreign\r\nstate which rules the empire: but in all cases the one thing necessary\r\nis that there shall be a central supreme power and that the commands of\r\nthat supreme power shall be implicitly obeyed by everyone within the\r\nempire.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that most of the propositions which I have\r\nenumerated are qualified with a saving word or saving clause to admit\r\nthe existence of exceptions. The exceptions however are not, so far as\r\nI can judge, very numerous. Among the governments of city states the\r\nCleisthenean constitution at Athens was exceptional, since, though it\r\nwas more like a democracy than anything else, it was not by any means\r\nan unmixed democracy: and some similar exceptions occur, I believe, in\r\nthe earliest part of the history of some medieval cities in Lombardy.\r\nDuring the middle ages, it was only in those peoples which best\r\ndeserved the name of large political communities or incipient nations\r\nthat an effective division of power between a king and an assembly of\r\nestates was to be found, and even in them it was not maintained without\r\noccasional interruptions: in England for example there were three\r\nperiods (1258-1259, 1310-1322, and 1388-1389) of pure oligarchy, and\r\ntwo (1200-1215, and 1397-1399) of pure despotism: among the French and\r\nin some other peoples which had not truly acquired the character of\r\npolitical communities, we find a semblance of a division of power, but\r\nnot the reality. The assertion that the nations during the sixteenth\r\nand seventeenth centuries were ruled by strong monarchical governments\r\nscarcely needs any qualification: there is however a short exceptional\r\nperiod in English history, 1649-1653, when the government was an\r\noligarchy; and Poland never acquired a strong monarchical government,\r\nbut was punished for the absence of such a government by ceasing to\r\nexist. In the course of the French Revolution 1789-1795 there occur\r\nsome seeming exceptions to the propositions about forms of government\r\nwhich have been enumerated: but I believe they will be found not to be\r\nexceptions, if we observe that during those years Paris was practically\r\nan independent city state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nGREEK POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS. HEROIC MONARCHIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe political institutions of the Greeks will be examined first,\r\nbecause the Greeks are known to us at an earlier period than any other\r\nEuropean people.\r\n\r\nHellas, the land of the Greeks, is about equal in size to half of\r\nScotland or Ireland or to a third of England[15]. It is intersected\r\nby a network of continuous mountain ranges, which cannot be crossed\r\nwithout difficulty, and these ranges are almost everywhere so near\r\ntogether that it is impossible to travel more than twenty miles in\r\nany direction without crossing one of them. There are therefore no\r\nplains of any considerable extent, and the country is cut up into very\r\nnumerous small areas, each enclosed, except towards the sea, within\r\nnatural barriers which make egress and entrance alike difficult. These\r\nareas are of varying minuteness: by far the greater number of them\r\nmeasure only ten miles by ten, or twenty by five, but a few are of\r\nlarger dimensions, and, in particular, Argolis contains about four\r\nhundred and fifty square miles, and is as large as Bedfordshire,\r\nAttica contains seven hundred and twenty, and just equals Berkshire,\r\nand Laconia, with about nine hundred, is of the same size as\r\nWarwickshire[16].\r\n\r\n  [15] In making this statement I have regarded Thessaly as not forming\r\n  part of Hellas. Thessaly was completely cut off from the rest by two\r\n  great ranges of mountains and was conquered before the beginning of\r\n  Greek history by a people who were not truly Hellenic.\r\n\r\n  [16] These areas of Argolis, Attica, Laconia are calculated from\r\n  the maps in Smith's _Atlas_: the other areas referred to are taken\r\n  from the _Statesman's Yearbook_, or the article _Graecia_ in Smith's\r\n  _Dictionary of Geography_.\r\n\r\nIf communication by land is difficult, by sea it is easy, and was\r\neasy even in the earliest times. Greece and its islands have as much\r\nsea-board as any equal area in Europe; most of the natural divisions of\r\nthe country have their share of coast with sheltered beaches where the\r\nboats or small ships of ancient times could be drawn up in safety: the\r\nMediterranean, though it is sometimes as dangerous as any sea, is often\r\ncalm: and by the age of Homer it had come to be a great highway for\r\nwar, piracy and commerce.\r\n\r\nThe career of all the Greek communities, except Sparta, divides itself\r\nreadily into periods. The first period, lasting till perhaps 700\r\nB.C. or 650 B.C., was the period of tribes and tribal governments:\r\nthe second, lasting to 338 B.C., was the period of cities and city\r\ngovernments. The period of the cities must however be divided into\r\nthree lesser periods, each characterised by the prevalence of a\r\ncertain kind of city government: the first of these lesser periods\r\nlasted from about 700 B.C. to 600 B.C., the second from 600 B.C. to\r\n500 B.C., and the third from 500 B.C. to 338 B.C. Between 700 B.C.\r\nand 600 B.C. Athens, Corinth and Megara were under the domination of\r\ngroups of privileged families, and many Greek cities in Sicily were\r\nalso governed by small groups of citizens distinguished either by birth\r\nor by wealth: and, since the rule of a few is known as an aristocracy\r\nif the few rulers are the men best qualified to rule and if they use\r\ntheir power for the good of the whole community, but as an oligarchy\r\nif the few rulers govern for their own selfish interest, the century\r\nmay be called the period of the early aristocracies and oligarchies.\r\nBetween 600 B.C. and 500 B.C. nearly every Greek city, both in Greece\r\nproper and elsewhere, came under the rule of a τύραννος or usurper\r\nof absolute power, so that the century may be called the age of the\r\ntyrants or usurpers. And lastly, between 500 B.C. and 338 B.C. in many\r\nof the Greek cities a system of government was set up under which the\r\nwhole body of the citizens acting collectively conducted the work of\r\ngovernment, or at least all parts of it which can in the nature of\r\nthings be conducted by a numerous assembly, while in other cities\r\na small body of the richest citizens ruled selfishly for their own\r\nadvantage and the advantage of their class; and, since any system\r\nin which the whole body of citizens directly conduct the work of\r\ngovernment or the greater part of the work of government is known as a\r\ndemocracy, while the selfish rule of a few is, as we have seen, called\r\nan oligarchy, the period may best be called the age of the democracies\r\nand of the later oligarchies.\r\n\r\nThe Spartans were unlike, in their history their institutions and the\r\naims of their policy, not only to all other Greek communities but\r\nperhaps to every other community that has ever existed: they never\r\ncompletely grew out of their tribal condition, never entirely abandoned\r\ntheir tribal government, and never formed themselves into a city like\r\nthe other Greek cities: and besides all this they were in so many ways\r\nunlike to the rest of mankind that it will be necessary for me to speak\r\nof them by themselves and apart from the rest of the Greeks.\r\n\r\nThe Greek communities and their political systems from the earliest\r\ntimes to the first overthrow of Greek independence in 338 B.C. will\r\nbe treated in the present and the next two chapters in the following\r\norder: firstly, we shall examine the tribes and the tribal governments,\r\nsecondly, the institutions and government of the Spartans, and thirdly,\r\nthe cities and the city-governments.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREEK TRIBES AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS.\r\n\r\nThe numerous tribes which composed the Greek race ranged themselves in\r\nseveral groups, distinguished from one another in name, characteristics\r\nand fortunes. Among these groups the Achæans, the Dorians and the\r\nIonians are historically the most important. The Achæan group includes\r\nall the tribes that are conspicuous in the Iliad and Odyssey: and from\r\nthis circumstance it may safely be inferred that, when those poems\r\nwere composed, the Achæan tribes had made more progress than any other\r\nGreeks in knowledge and political organisation. The Dorians in the\r\ndays of Homer were an obscure tribe living in a little mountain valley\r\nof Northern Greece: in the next age they invaded the Peloponnesus,\r\nexpelled the Achæans from their homes, and formed themselves into the\r\nfour peoples of the Spartans, the Messenians, the Corinthians and\r\nthe Argives. The Ionian tribes, the Athenians and twelve of the Greek\r\ncities of Asia Minor, including Miletus and Ephesus, were even later\r\nthan the Dorian peoples in rising to importance. I shall deal first\r\nwith the Achæans and then with the Dorians and Ionians.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _The Achæan tribes in the heroic age._\r\n\r\nWhen the Iliad and the Odyssey were composed the Achæans had formed a\r\ngreat number of small independent communities, some inhabiting islands,\r\nand others living in valleys surrounded by chains of mountains. The\r\nonly tribe whose methods of government are depicted in some detail was\r\none of the least of the Greek peoples, and had its home in Ithaca, a\r\nrocky island of the Ionian sea about seventeen miles long and three or\r\nfour miles broad. The larger tribes were the Mycenæans, the Spartans,\r\nand the Achæans of Phthiotis. All the Achæan tribes were much alike in\r\ntheir political institutions: for the same political terms βασιλεύς,\r\nἀγορή, γέροντες, λαοί are used in reference to the various tribes\r\nwithout distinction. Their governments were tribal in character, and we\r\nmay call them either by the generic name of tribal governments, or by\r\nthe name, which they more usually bear, of heroic monarchies.\r\n\r\nThe government of an Achæan tribe was conducted, in time of peace,\r\nin assemblies (ἀγορα). The purposes for which they met included\r\nthe announcement of any important news[17], discussion of any\r\npublic business or question of policy[18] or the settlement of a\r\nlitigation[19]. Our knowledge of their character and proceedings is\r\nderived from a full description in the second book of the Odyssey of an\r\nassembly held at Ithaca, and a shorter description in the Iliad[20].\r\n\r\n  [17] _Odyssey_ II. 30 ἀγγελίην στρατοῦ ἐρχομένοιο (news of the host\r\n  returning).\r\n\r\n  [18] _Odyssey_ II. 32 ἦέ τι ζημιον ἄλλο πιφαύσκεται ἠδ' ἀγορεύει; (or\r\n  has he any other public business to discuss?)\r\n\r\n  [19] _Iliad_ XVIII. 497 νεῖκος (a dispute).\r\n\r\n  [20] _Odyssey_ II. 1-259, _Iliad_ XVIII. 497-508.\r\n\r\nWhenever the king desired that an assembly should be held he gave the\r\nheralds orders to require the immediate attendance of the elders and\r\nthe people[21]. The place of meeting was an open space in the city set\r\napart for the purpose. In the midst was a circle of stone seats for the\r\nking and the elders[22], and one of the seats belonged specially to the\r\nking[23]: outside were the people, all of whom were compelled by the\r\nheralds to seat themselves on the ground[24] and to be silent[25]. When\r\nthis had been done, the work of the assembly began; the speakers were\r\nthe king and the elders, and the people either kept silence or perhaps\r\nindicated their approval by shouting or their dissent by murmurs. The\r\ncouncillors who sat with the king and had the right of speaking were\r\nfor the most part (as the name γέροντες, if taken literally, denotes)\r\nmen of age and experience: but younger men of good family, such as the\r\nwooers of Penelope[26], were also sometimes present among them and\r\nshared their privileges.\r\n\r\n  [21] _Odyssey_ II. 6. The Ithacan assembly was summoned by the king's\r\n  son in his father's absence: but the summons was irregular, as is\r\n  shown in the next paragraph.\r\n\r\n  [22] _Iliad_ XVIII. 503\r\n\r\n                     οἱ δὲ γέροντες\r\n     εἵατ' ἐπὶ ξεστοῖσι λίθοις ἱερῷ ἐνὶ κύκλῳ.\r\n\r\n  The stone seats are mentioned only in the description of a judicial\r\n  assembly: but all assemblies met, there is no doubt, in the same place.\r\n\r\n  [23] _Odyssey_ II. 14 ἕζετο δ' ἐν ἕζετο δ' ἐν (Τηλέμαχος), ϝεῖξαν\r\n  δὲ γέροντες (and Telemachus sat down in his father's seat, and the\r\n  elders made way for him).\r\n\r\n  [24] See Grote's note in his _History_, Part I. ch. XX. His instances\r\n  (_Iliad_ II. 96 and _Iliad_ XVIII. 246) are both taken from time of\r\n  war: but it is not in the least likely that this detail was peculiar\r\n  to assemblies held at such times.\r\n\r\n  [25] _Iliad_ II. 96\r\n\r\n                   ἐννέας δά σφεας\r\n     κήρυκες βοόωντες ἐρήτυον, εἴ ποτ' ἀϋτῆς\r\n     σχοίατ' ἀκούσειαν δὲ διοτρεφέων βασιλήων\r\n\r\n  (and nine heralds were calling them to order, to stop clamouring and\r\n  hearken to the heaven-born kings).\r\n\r\n  [26] At the Ithacan assembly the suitors Antinous, Eurymachus, and\r\n  Leiocritus were among the speakers. _Odyssey_ II. 84-254.\r\n\r\nThe assembly at Ithaca was irregularly summoned. The words of the first\r\nspeaker, the aged Ægyptius, show that according to custom the king\r\nalone had the prerogative of issuing a summons by the voice of the\r\nheralds. Odysseus had been absent for twenty years: and Ægyptius says,\r\n\"Since the godlike Odysseus departed in his hollow ships our assembly\r\nand session has never been held. And now who is he that summoned us?\r\nwho was compelled by so great necessity? has he heard news of our\r\nwarriors coming back, and hastens to tell us? or has he aught else of\r\nour country's weal to speak about? I say he is a good man, God bless\r\nhim! and may Zeus perform for him whatever his heart desires![27]\"\r\n\r\n  [27] _Odyssey_ II. 25-34.\r\n\r\nThe business of the assembly at Ithaca was not exactly judicial and\r\ncan scarcely be described as deliberation on policy. Telemachus\r\nsummoned the elders and the people in order to declare to them that the\r\nproceedings of the suitors were intolerable to him, that he bade them\r\nleave his house, that he would resist them by force, if he could, and\r\nthat if they were slain in his house no price for their lives would be\r\ndue from him to their kindred.\r\n\r\nThe assembly came to no formal resolution: the practical result of it\r\nwas settled by the speeches of the elders without any intervention of\r\nthe common folk, and was expressed by the last speaker Leiocritus, who\r\ndeclared that the suitors were not afraid of Telemachus nor of Odysseus\r\nhimself, and bade all those who were present to go away each about his\r\nown business.\r\n\r\nAn assembly occupied in administering justice was depicted in\r\na compartment of the shield of Achilles, which the poet thus\r\ndescribes[28]: \"A people too was there, gathered in assembly: and in\r\ntheir midst a dispute had arisen, and two men were disputing about the\r\nprice (wergild) of a man that had been slain. The one was declaring\r\naloud to the multitude that he had paid the whole, the other that he\r\nhad received none of it. And both were ready to go before a judge to\r\nget a decision: and the people on this side and on that were cheering\r\nthem on, but were restrained by the heralds. And there sat the\r\nelders on seats of wrought stone in a circle protected by the gods,\r\nholding staves given them by the loud-voiced heralds; and then the\r\nelders were arising in turn to give judgement. And in the midst were\r\nlying two talents of gold to be given to him whose judgement was the\r\nstraightest[29].\"\r\n\r\n  [28] _Iliad_ XVIII. 497-508.\r\n\r\n  [29] _Or perhaps_, to him who best proved his case.\r\n\r\nIn this assembly, as in the other, power belonged solely to those\r\nwho formed the inner circle. The presence of the king in the judicial\r\nassembly is not mentioned, but kings did sometimes take part in giving\r\ndooms, for Nestor says to Agamemnon: \"O most famous son of Atreus,\r\nAgamemnon, king of men, thou shalt be my ending and thou my beginning,\r\nbecause thou art king of many people and Zeus has given thee the\r\nsceptre _and judgements_ that thou mayst be their counselor[30].\"\r\n\r\n  [30] _Iliad_ IX. 96-99.\r\n\r\nThere is a story in the Odyssey which indicates more clearly than\r\nthe descriptions of the assemblies that, in time of peace, supreme\r\npower belonged to the king and the elders jointly and not to the king\r\nalone or to the elders alone. While Laertes was reigning in Ithaca\r\nthree hundred sheep belonging to Ithacans were stolen by robbers from\r\nMessenia. Odysseus, the king's son, was sent to ask satisfaction for\r\nthe wrong: and it is expressly stated that it was the king and the\r\nother elders who empowered him to act as ambassador[31].\r\n\r\n [31] _Odyssey_ XXI. 16-21.\r\n\r\nIn time of war the king had supreme and exclusive command over his\r\ntribe. Thus when Achilles king of the Phthiotians was angry with\r\nAgamemnon, he was able without consultation with any one to withdraw\r\nthe whole Phthiotian contingent from aiding in the war against the\r\nTrojans: and, when he began to relent, nothing was needed but a word\r\nfrom him to place his forces in the field again under the orders of his\r\nfriend Patroclus[32]. Agamemnon on the other hand, being the commander\r\nof a host composed of contingents from many tribes, found it necessary,\r\nbefore issuing any orders to the whole army, to consult the kings who\r\nwere taking part with him in his enterprise[33].\r\n\r\n [32] _Iliad_ XVI. 38-39. Patroclus says to him, \"If thou art deterred\r\n by some divine command from fighting thyself, yet let me go and give\r\n me thy people, the Myrmidons (i.e. the Phthiotians)\": and Achilles\r\n (lines 49-65) replies, \"I have been wronged and therefore will not\r\n fight: thou shalt wear my armour and command the Myrmidons.\"\r\n\r\n [33] _Iliad_ II. 53, IX. 9-17, 89-95.\r\n\r\nOur conclusions about the political system which prevailed in the Greek\r\ntribes of the heroic age can be shortly summed up. In time of peace all\r\npublic business was conducted in assemblies: in these assemblies the\r\nking and the elders alone had the right of speaking, and the king was\r\nexpected to act according to the advice of the elders. In time of war\r\nthe king was commander-in-chief, and could act without control from any\r\none.\r\n\r\nBesides the political institutions of the ancient Greeks, some of the\r\ngeneral conditions of their life may be noticed. They depended for\r\ntheir subsistence partly on their cattle and partly on the produce of\r\nthe ground, and most of the poorer free men, not possessing slaves,\r\nlived in the country to tend their herds and till their lands. Some,\r\nwho had no herds and no lands of their own, worked as labourers for\r\nhire[34]. The estates and the cattle of the kings and rich men were\r\ncommitted to the charge of slaves captured in war or in freebooting\r\nexpeditions[35]. The kings and rich men themselves lived, not scattered\r\nover the open country after the fashion of the Germans described by\r\nTacitus[36], but collected in cities. Thus at Ithaca the house of the\r\nking and the houses of the wooers of Penelope were all close together:\r\nfor at the end of the first day in the story of the Odyssey the wooers\r\n\"went each to his house to sleep[37]\" and on the morrow at the dawn\r\nof day at the summons of the heralds they \"came very quickly to the\r\nassembly[38]\": Pylos, where Nestor lived, is called the gathering place\r\nand the abodes of the Pylians[39]: and, not to multiply instances,\r\nwords denoting cities are regularly applied in the Homeric poems to the\r\ndwelling-places of the heroes.\r\n\r\n  [34] _Odyssey_ XI. 489 θητευέμεν.\r\n\r\n  [35] Grote's _Greece_, octavo edition vol. I. p. 487, cabinet edition\r\n  vol. II. p. 98.\r\n\r\n  [36] Tac. _Germ._ 16. Nullas Germanorum populis urbes habitari satis\r\n  notum est, ne pati quidem inter se junctas sedes. Colunt discreti ac\r\n  diversi, ut fons, ut campus, ut nemus placuit.\r\n\r\n  [37] _Odyssey_ I. 424 κακκείοντες ἔβαν ϝοικόνδε ϝέκαστος.\r\n\r\n  [38] _Odyssey_ II. 8 τοὶ δ' ἠγείροντο μάλ' ὦκα.\r\n\r\n  [39] _Odyssey_ III. 31 Πυλίων ἀνδρῶν ἄγυρίν τε καὶ ἕδρας.\r\n\r\nThe cities of the heroic age had, for their defence, in all cases a\r\nfortress or strong place of refuge close at hand, and some of them at\r\nleast were entirely encircled with a wall. Argos lay at the foot of the\r\nsteep isolated mountain of the Larissa which rose about a thousand feet\r\nabove it: Corinth was under the still loftier Acrocorinthus; Mycenæ\r\nand Athens had each its Acropolis, a strong fortress built on a rock\r\nrising abruptly but to no great height above the town. That in some\r\ncases the lower city, as distinct from the Acropolis, had also its own\r\nouter wall is proved by the whole story of the siege of Troy, which\r\nshows that cities entirely enclosed in fortifications were well known\r\nto Homer[40].\r\n\r\n  [40] Especially the scene of the death of Hector in the twenty-second\r\n  book of the Iliad. Achilles having driven all the Trojans except\r\n  Hector within their walls, pursued Hector thrice round the city, in\r\n  the sight of the Trojans on the walls and of the host of the Greeks\r\n  assembled on the plain outside the city. If any part of the city had\r\n  been outside the wall, it must have been mentioned as impeding or\r\n  aiding the flight of Hector, or as having been captured by the Greeks.\r\n  As it is, the poet has no landmark outside the city to show how far\r\n  the chase had extended except a fountain where the two springs, one\r\n  hot and one cold, of the Scamander, had been built round with stone\r\n  platforms on which clothing was washed by the Trojan women.\r\n\r\nThere are numberless passages in the Iliad and Odyssey which prove\r\nthat the houses of the heroes were well stored with wealth. The\r\nsuitors who intruded as guests at the house of Telemachus always\r\nfound plenty of cattle, bread, wine and oil ready at hand for their\r\nriotous feasts, and yet Telemachus was but a poor man among the Greek\r\nprinces. When Telemachus paid a visit to Menelaus and Helen at Sparta\r\nhe was astonished to find that their palace glittered with gold and\r\nsilver, with electrum (a mixture of two metals) and with ivory[41].\r\nThe chamber of Odysseus at Ithaca contained abundance of gold and\r\nbronze, and clothing in chests and sweet smelling oil and wine in jars\r\nagainst his return[42]. The metal used for weapons was brass or bronze:\r\nagricultural implements were chiefly made of iron: of the precious\r\nmetals gold was more commonly used than silver[43]. We do not hear that\r\nany of these metals were obtained in the heroic age from the soil of\r\nGreece itself, and may fairly conjecture that they were brought to the\r\nGreeks by the Phœnicians who in that age were more active in trade than\r\nany other people[44].\r\n\r\n  [41] _Odyssey_ IV. 68-75.\r\n\r\n  [42] _Odyssey_ II. 337-343.\r\n\r\n  [43] The evidence concerning the use of the metals is collected by\r\n  Grote, octavo edition vol. I. p. 493, cabinet edition vol. II. pp.\r\n  104, 105.\r\n\r\n  [44] For the dealings of the Phœnicians see the story in which Eumæus\r\n  the swineherd narrates how he was kidnapped as a child by Phœnician\r\n  traders. _Odyssey_ XV. 403-484.\r\n\r\nThe population of a city must have consisted of the wealthy families\r\nwho had slaves to till their lands and tend their flocks and of those\r\nfew artificers or professional men whose business brought them to\r\nlive near the houses of the rich. Among the handicraftsmen were the\r\ncarpenter, the copper-smith, the leather-dresser, the worker in gold:\r\nthe professions were those of the leech, the prophet and the bard[45].\r\nThus it may be that in an assembly the people outside the sacred circle\r\ndid not greatly surpass in number the elders who sat within it: for\r\nthere were no classes to constitute a people except the younger members\r\nof the families of the elders and the few men who were induced to live\r\nin the city to find employment for their knowledge or skill.\r\n\r\n  [45] Grote, _Greece_, octavo edition vol. I. p. 486, cabinet edition\r\n  vol. II. p. 97. For the worker in gold see _Odyssey_ III. 425.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _The Dorians and the Ionians in the heroic age._\r\n\r\nBefore the beginning of Greek History, properly so called, the\r\nAchæan peoples, so important in the eyes of Homer, had sunk into\r\ncomparative insignificance, and the first places in the Hellenic\r\nworld had been filled by Dorians and Ionians. The original abode of\r\nthe Dorians was a small mountainous country called Doris not far from\r\nThermopylæ[46]. From hence bands of adventurers had gone forth and,\r\ninvading Peloponnesus, had expelled the Achæans from Sparta, Messenia,\r\nArgos and Corinth, had occupied their territories and had copied their\r\ninstitutions. The Ionians in Attica had grown in prosperity and power,\r\nand, like the Dorian tribes, had adopted that form of government which\r\nI have called heroic monarchy.\r\n\r\n  [46] Herodotus VIII. 31 in speaking of the position of Doris remarks,\r\n  \"This country is the mother country of the Dorians in Peloponnesus.\"\r\n\r\nOf the Dorian kingly government at Corinth we know nothing but its\r\nexistence[47]: of the Messenian kings we have many stories told by\r\nMyron of Priene, but, on reading them side by side with the stories\r\ntold by Geoffrey of Monmouth about King Arthur, I thought that for\r\ncomplete untrustworthiness there was nothing to choose between the two\r\nauthors[48]: concerning the early kings of Argos Athens and Sparta,\r\na few facts are established on good authority, and these I shall now\r\nproceed to state.\r\n\r\n  [47] Diodorus Siculus VII. fragment 9. Diodorus wrote about 20-10 B.C.\r\n\r\n  [48] Myron wrote about 220 B.C. His stories about the early Messenian\r\n  kings are preserved by Pausanias in his fourth book.\r\n\r\nArgos, with its two neighbours Mycenæ and Tiryns, was in some respects\r\nunlike the other Greek communities. Elsewhere in Greece during the\r\nheroic age each community occupied the whole of a natural division of\r\nthe country, and had its territory fenced round with natural barriers.\r\nIn the Argolic plain three Achæan communities had found room to settle,\r\nexactly as in Italy many communities found room to settle in and around\r\nthe plain of Latium: and thus the Argolic communities rather resembled\r\nthe Latin cities than the Greek tribes. Their city walls were of\r\nexceptional strength, as the remains of them testify: their kings were\r\nricher and were exalted to a greater eminence above their subjects than\r\nthe other Greek kings, for the palace of the king at Tiryns occupies\r\nnearly the whole of the upper citadel and is such as to demand a most\r\nprodigal expenditure of labour for its construction[49], and Agamemnon\r\nking of Mycenæ is represented by the poet of the Iliad as a powerful\r\nmonarch. It cannot be doubted that the three cities had the same\r\nreasons for making their walls strong and their kings powerful as the\r\nRomans had in the days of Servius Tullius: they feared that they might\r\nbe conquered by their neighbours, and hoped that they might themselves\r\nbe the conquerors.\r\n\r\n  [49] Professor Gardner, _New Chapters in Greek History_, pp. 96-101.\r\n\r\nAfter the Dorian conquest the three cities still continued to exist:\r\nArgos was the strongest of them, but Mycenæ acted independently of\r\nArgos so late as the year 480 B.C. in sending a contingent to fight\r\nagainst the Persians at Thermopylæ[50]. The great power of the\r\nDorian monarchy was conspicuous in the reign of Pheidon, who at some\r\ntime between 750 B.C. and 600 B.C. became so powerful that he was\r\nable to conduct an expedition from his own city in the east of the\r\nPeloponnesus to Olympia in the west and to deprive the Eleians by force\r\nof their prerogative of presiding over the Olympic festival[51]. He\r\nalso established a hegemony or lordship over a number of Greek peoples\r\nin the neighbourhood of Argos, which had long been independent. The\r\ntradition of his conquest says simply that he \"recovered the whole lot\r\nof Têmenus which had been broken up into many parts[52].\" Têmenus,\r\naccording to the legends of the Heracleids, was one of the leaders of\r\nthe Dorians in their invasion of the Peloponnesus: and it seems that\r\nhis \"lot\" must have included the tribes that lived at Cleonæ, Phlius,\r\nSicyon, Epidaurus, Trœzen, and Ægina. Pheidon's conquest of these\r\ntribes was a remarkable achievement, since all of them were protected\r\nagainst Argos by mountain ranges or by sea: and it gave him such\r\ndespotic authority over his own subjects at Argos that he is counted\r\namong the τύραννοι[53]. But it seems that he ought not, strictly\r\nspeaking, to be reckoned among them, being unlike to the rest of them\r\nin two important particulars: first, that his despotic authority at\r\nArgos was no doubt necessary in order to enable Argos to keep control\r\nover the dependent peoples, and second, that it is not likely that he\r\never incurred the hatred of the people of Argos: for, if he had been\r\nhated by his own subjects, his power outside Argos must have promptly\r\ncome to an end. After his time the power of the king at Argos ceased to\r\nbe despotic, the neighbouring tribes recovered their independence, and\r\nthe monarchy sank into obscurity, though it continued to exist so late\r\nas 480 B.C. when Greece was invaded by the Persians under Xerxes[54].\r\n\r\n  [50] Pausanias II. 16. 5.\r\n\r\n  [51] Pausanias (VI. 22. 2) in speaking of this expedition assigns it\r\n  to the eighth Olympiad or the year 748 B.C. I have not ventured to\r\n  regard his date as trustworthy, because Professor Mahaffy (_Problems\r\n  in Greek History_, Chapter III.) has shown reasons for doubting\r\n  whether the order of the early Olympiads was correctly given in\r\n  the lists which were current among the Greeks. His date however\r\n  cannot well be earlier than 750 B.C., since it was after the Olympic\r\n  festivals had become important: and it cannot be later than 600 B.C.,\r\n  because in that case clearer traditions about him would have been\r\n  preserved.\r\n\r\n  [52] Ephorus, who wrote about 350 B.C., records this. His words are\r\n  quoted by Grote, octavo edition vol. II. p. 90, cabinet edition vol.\r\n  II. p. 316, from Strabo.\r\n\r\n  [53] Aristotle, _Politics_, V. 10. 6, in Bekker's edition (Oxford,\r\n  1837). Welldon, p. 381. Pausanias VI. 22. 2.\r\n\r\n  [54] The king of Argos in 480 B.C. is noticed by Herodotus (VII. 149).\r\n\r\nIn Attica we can carry back our view not only to the age of the heroic\r\nmonarchy but to the age which preceded it. The country, though it is,\r\nas we have seen, of small extent, and though it is not traversed by\r\nany continuous ranges of mountains, was originally peopled by a number\r\nof independent communities, each contained within a single village\r\nor small township: and it is probable that these little communities\r\nretained their independence till after the time of Homer; for Athens,\r\nwhich rose to greatness by subjugating them, is rarely mentioned in the\r\nHomeric poems, and never, I believe, in any passage which belongs to\r\nthe poems as they were originally composed. In course of time however\r\na powerful king arose at Athens, who succeeded in bringing the whole\r\ncountry under a single monarchy of the heroic type: and Thucydides\r\ntells us that in his own days the union of Attica under Athens was\r\nregularly celebrated at a public festival[55].\r\n\r\n  [55] Thucydides II. 15. The original independence of the small\r\n  communities is most fully vouched for by the festival, called τὰ\r\n  συνοίκια, or the union of dwellings: and it furnishes a reason for\r\n  the policy adopted by Cleisthenes of establishing popular local\r\n  governments in the demes, or villages and townships, of Attica: see\r\n  Chapter V.\r\n\r\nThe Spartans, instead of having one king, had two kings and two royal\r\nfamilies[56], so that their system of government may best be described\r\nas a dual heroic kingship. Of this government, and of the conquests\r\nmade by the Spartans while they lived under it, I shall have more to\r\nsay in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n  [56] Herodotus VI. 52.\r\n\r\nOf the other tribes in the prehistoric age we have no traditions: but\r\nThucydides[57] says without hesitation concerning the early Greeks in\r\ngeneral that their governments were \"hereditary kingly governments\r\nwith limited prerogatives\": and the same view, which was shared by all\r\nthe later Greeks, falls in with the little that is known of the Greek\r\npeoples in the first two or three centuries of their history.\r\n\r\n  [57] Thucydides I. 13 ἐπὶ ῥητοῖς γέρασι πατρικαὶ βασιλεῖαι.\r\n\r\nIt is clear from many indications that the monarchical part of\r\nthe old tribal constitutions was necessary or especially useful\r\nto the primitive Greek peoples so long as they were employed in\r\nmaking conquests or settlements of new territory, and no longer. In\r\nthe prehistoric age the Athenians and all the Dorian peoples were\r\nconquering peoples: and all of them made their conquests under the\r\nleadership of kings. In the next age, which came between the heroic\r\nperiod and the beginning of Greek history in the proper sense of the\r\nword, the great majority of the Greek peoples had ceased to acquire\r\nnew territory within Greece and had also ceased or were ceasing to be\r\nmonarchically governed: two peoples, the Spartans and the Argives, were\r\nexceptional both in continuing to make territorial conquests and in\r\nstill living under kingly rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nSPARTA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Spartans present so many peculiarities and are so unlike to any\r\nother people that I must divide what I have to say about them under\r\nseparate heads. In regard to the Spartans before the Peloponnesian war\r\nI shall describe (I) their political surroundings, (II) their customs,\r\n(III) their constitution: for the period of the war and that which\r\nfollowed it, I shall give (IV) a general view of their commonwealth as\r\nit then stood.\r\n\r\nI. The Spartans or Spartiatæ were the strongest and most warlike of\r\nthose Dorian tribes who at some time after the time of Homer and\r\nyet long before the beginning of history migrated from the rocky\r\nvalley of Doris in northern Greece and invaded the Peloponnesus. They\r\nsubsequently lived in the unwalled city of Sparta as a small nation of\r\nconquerors surrounded by the two subject populations of the Periœci\r\nand the Helots, who peopled the country of Laconia. In 480 B.C., when\r\nthe Spartans were at the height of their power, just after their\r\nking Leonidas and his three hundred had made their heroic defence at\r\nThermopylæ, Xerxes asked Demaratus, who had once been king of Sparta\r\nbut had been deposed, to tell him how many warriors remained to the\r\nLacedæmonians and how many of them were as brave as the three hundred;\r\nDemaratus replied: \"O king, the number of the Lacedæmonians is great\r\nand their cities are many: thou shalt know what thou desirest to learn.\r\nThere is in Lacedæmon a city Sparta, of about eight thousand fighting\r\nmen, and all these are like to those that fought at Thermopylæ: the\r\nother Lacedæmonians are not indeed equal to these, but yet they are\r\nbrave[58].\" As the Spartans of military age numbered eight thousand\r\nwe may reckon that forty thousand was about the number of persons,\r\nincluding women and children, who belonged to Spartan families and\r\nformed the Spartan nation.\r\n\r\n  [58] Herodotus VII. 234.\r\n\r\nThe Periœci were \"the other Lacedæmonians, not indeed equal to the\r\nSpartiatæ, but yet brave men,\" and by them the cities of Lacedæmon\r\nexcept Sparta were inhabited. It seems that the Periœci were decidedly\r\nmore numerous than the Spartiatæ: in the year after the conversation\r\nbetween Xerxes and Demaratus the force, which was sent out to fight the\r\nPersian general Mardonius and which took part in the great battle of\r\nPlatæa, consisted of five thousand Spartans, of thirty-five thousand\r\nlight armed Helots, seven Helots being allotted as attendants to each\r\nSpartan, and of five thousand picked hoplites or heavy armed warriors\r\nfrom the Periœci[59]. As these Periœci were picked men, there were more\r\nto pick from: of the force of Spartiatæ Grote remarks that \"throughout\r\nthe whole course of Grecian history we never hear of any number of\r\nSpartan citizens at all approaching to five thousand being put on\r\nforeign service at the same time[60].\"\r\n\r\n  [59] Herodotus IX. 10, IX. 28, and IX. 11.\r\n\r\n  [60] Grote, _Greece_, octavo edition vol. III. p. 494, cabinet edition\r\n  vol. V. p. 11.\r\n\r\nIt is not certain whether the Periœci were Achæans or Dorians in\r\norigin. Whichever they were, our view of the Spartans and their\r\ngovernment will be much the same. The Periœci were not treated with\r\ndistrust or systematic cruelty: they retained their personal freedom\r\nunder the Spartan rule, they continued to inhabit the towns or cities\r\nof Laconia, and in each of their towns to manage their local affairs\r\nfor themselves[61]: but they had no voice whatever in the politics\r\nof Sparta, which were controlled exclusively by the Spartans.\r\nOccasionally a man of ability from among the Periœci was promoted to\r\na position of trust: thus in the year 412 B.C. a man named Deiniadas,\r\na Periœcus, commanded a squadron of ships in the war on the coasts of\r\nAsia Minor and of Lesbos[62].\r\n\r\n  [61] If they had not possessed the management of their local affairs,\r\n  their communities would scarcely have been called πόλεις by Herodotus\r\n  in the conversation between Xerxes and Demaratus. Herodotus VII. 234;\r\n  Smith's _Dict. Antiq._ article Periœci.\r\n\r\n  [62] Thucydides VIII. 22 ἦρχε τῶν νεῶ ν Δεινιάδας περίοικος (Deiniadas\r\n  a Periœcus was in command of the ships).\r\n\r\nThe Helots formed in the fifth century B.C. a large population of serfs\r\nwho tilled the soil: they were the property of the Spartan state, which\r\nhowever placed the services of Helots at the disposal of the Spartans\r\nand Periœci for the cultivation of their estates. The Helots, who were\r\nbound to the soil on any given estate were compelled every year to\r\nrender a fixed quantity of produce to the owner: on the residue they\r\nand their families subsisted[63].\r\n\r\n  [63] These statements about the condition of the Helots are not\r\n  given by either Herodotus or Thucydides, but are found in Plutarch\r\n  and Pausanias. Plutarch wrote about 60-70 A.D., and Pausanias about\r\n  170-180 A.D.: but both copied authors probably of the fourth century\r\n  B.C. Pausanias (III. 20. 6) speaks of the Helots as slaves belonging\r\n  to the state (δοῦλοι τοῦ κοινοῦ): the rest comes from Plutarch,\r\n  _Lycurgus_, ch. 8.\r\n\r\nThe name εἵλωτες denotes captives taken in war[64]. It was believed by\r\nthe Greeks that the Spartans, when first they made their conquest of\r\nLaconia, reduced some of those whom they conquered to the condition\r\nof Helots as above described: and the account given by them of the\r\ninstitutions of Lycurgus implies that the lawgiver foresaw some danger\r\nsuch as would arise from a large servile population. But if the Helots\r\nwere dangerous in the age of Lycurgus, they became far more dangerous\r\nafter the Spartans had conquered the Messenian country that lay to\r\nthe west of Laconia and of the range of Taygetus. The Messenians\r\nwere Dorians like the Spartans, and like them had conquered a large\r\ndistrict of the Peloponnesus. Against these neighbours and kinsmen\r\nthe Spartans waged two long wars, one probably in the eighth century\r\nB.C. and the other probably in the seventh[65]. In the second war\r\nthey were completely successful, and at the end of it they reduced\r\nthe Messenians, who had for some two or three centuries been a free\r\nand independent Dorian people, to the condition of Helots[66]. But\r\nto hold the territory was almost as hard as to win it: and to keep\r\nthe Messenians enslaved was almost as hard as to enslave them. The\r\nterritory is separated from Laconia by a chain of mountains, and the\r\nnew serfs were more dangerous than the original Helots because they\r\nremembered their freedom. From the time of the conquest of Messenia\r\nthe little Spartan nation stood in perpetual danger of a great servile\r\nrevolt. When, in 464 B.C., a rebellion of the Helots actually occurred,\r\nit imperilled the existence of the state. The Spartans at one time\r\ndespaired of putting it down without external aid, and, when the\r\nAthenians offered them the services of an armed force, accepted the\r\noffer. Subsequently, when their jealousy of Athens revived and they\r\nresolved to rely on their own unaided efforts, they had to spend all\r\ntheir strength for nine years before they compelled the Helots in their\r\nstronghold on Mount Ithomê to capitulate on condition that they should\r\ndepart from the Peloponnesus and never return[67]. Even after these\r\nbrave men had gone into exile, there were plenty of Helots left to keep\r\nthe Spartans in anxiety: and Thucydides in telling of the treacherous\r\nmurder of the two thousand Helots in 424 B.C. remarks incidentally that\r\n\"at all times most of the institutions of the Lacedæmonians were framed\r\nwith a view to the Helots, to guard against their insurrections[68].\"\r\n\r\n  [64] See Smith's _Dict. Antiq._, third edition, article Helotes.\r\n\r\n  [65] The dates of the Messenian wars cannot be determined with\r\n  certainty. See the note at the end of this chapter.\r\n\r\n  [66] Pausanias (III. 20. 6) expressly says that those serfs who were\r\n  acquired by the Spartans not in their original conquest of Laconia\r\n  but subsequently (that is to say at the conquest of Messenia) were\r\n  Messenian Dorians.\r\n\r\n  [67] The account of the revolt and its duration are taken from\r\n  Thucydides I. 101-103. The date of its beginning is given by Pausanias\r\n  IV. 24. 2 as being the seventy-ninth olympiad: i.e. seventy-eight\r\n  times four years after 776 B.C.: i.e. 464 B.C.\r\n\r\n  [68] Thucydides IV. 80.\r\n\r\nII. The singular regulations under which the Spartans lived were\r\ndesigned to discipline all the males among their scanty numbers into\r\na formidable military brotherhood. Possibly some of these regulations\r\nhad already been established before they left their original abodes in\r\nDoris to migrate to the Peloponnesus: they were attributed to Lycurgus,\r\na wise lawgiver, who is placed by the legends after the migration\r\nand some generations before the first Spartans of whom we have any\r\nhistorical knowledge: but the extreme strictness of their enforcement\r\nmay have dated from the end of the second Messenian war, which reduced\r\na whole people to servitude.\r\n\r\nThe earliest detailed account of the customs of the Spartans is given\r\nin a treatise on the Commonwealth of the Lacedæmonians, which has been\r\nattributed to Xenophon. Whoever the author may have been, it speaks of\r\nthe Spartans as if they were almost irresistible in warfare: and hence\r\nit must be inferred that it was written before 371 B.C., when they\r\nsuffered a severe and humiliating defeat at Leuctra in Bœotia. It gives\r\na picture of Spartan customs whose chief outlines I shall try to reduce\r\nwithin the dimensions of a sketch.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the Spartan discipline was to ensure the greatest possible\r\nefficiency in the little band of warriors who formed the Spartan army.\r\nTo this end it was first necessary that the race should be healthy: and\r\nas strong parents were likely to have strong offspring, the women no\r\nless than the men were trained in gymnastic exercises and contests[69].\r\nThe boys ceased at an early age to be under the sole authority of their\r\nown parents and were placed under the command of an officer of state\r\nwhose title was παιδονόμος or warden of the boys[70], and were also\r\ncompelled to obey any Spartan who had children of his own[71]. The\r\ntraining of the boys under their warden is not described in detail:\r\nbut there is no doubt it consisted in gymnastics and in marching and\r\ndancing to music. The moral qualities which were insisted on were\r\nfirstly personal courage and endurance, and secondly a modest demeanour\r\nin the young. The boys had to go barefoot, were allowed only one\r\ngarment to wear throughout the year in heat and cold alike, and were\r\nkept on short rations of food: they were encouraged to steal food,\r\nbut, if they were caught, were severely beaten for not having stolen\r\ncleverly[72]; and, if one of them complained to his father that another\r\nboy had beaten him, the father was thought to have disgraced himself\r\nif he did not give him a sound thrashing in addition[73]. The young\r\nmen always walked silent with their eyes modestly fixed on the ground\r\nbefore them; and from this behaviour you could no more seduce them\r\nthan you could a statue[74]. The great deference paid to age is merely\r\nhinted at in this treatise[75] but it is well known from other sources.\r\n\r\n  [69] [Xenophon] _De Rep. Lac._ 1. § 4.\r\n\r\n  [70] [Xenophon] _De Rep. Lac._ 2. § 2.\r\n\r\n  [71] [Xenophon] _De Rep. Lac._ 6. § 1, § 2.\r\n\r\n  [72] All these details from [Xenophon] _De Rep. Lac._ 2.\r\n\r\n  [73] [Xenophon] _De Rep.

Lac._ 9. § 5.\r\n\r\nWhen the youths grew up to be men they were compelled to dine at the\r\ncommon meal provided for them: and unless they paid their contributions\r\nto its cost they lost the rights of citizenship. Their military\r\ntraining no doubt still continued: for the operations of warfare\r\nwhich the author describes were such as to require every man in the\r\narmy to be always familiar with them from recent recollection[76].\r\nEvery Spartan was not only compelled to concentrate his attention on\r\nmilitary excellence, but was completely cut off from all commercial\r\npursuits and even from agriculture[77]. Commerce and all useful arts\r\nwere left to the Periœci: the Spartan could practise none of them\r\nwithout degradation. His expenditure consisted in his contribution to\r\nthe common meals and in the cost of maintaining a house for his wife\r\nand daughters and his sons till they were placed under the care of\r\nthe warden of the boys. His income was derived from his lands which\r\nwere tilled by Helots assigned to him by the State. The accumulation\r\nof wealth was severely discouraged: the possession of gold or silver\r\nwas criminal and was punished with a fine: the currency was made of\r\niron and was so cumbrous that no one could have much of it without the\r\nknowledge of all, since a quantity worth ten minæ (£40 sterling) would\r\ndemand large storage-room and a waggon to remove it[78].\r\n\r\n  [76] [Xenophon] _De Rep. Lac._ 11.\r\n\r\n  [77] [Xenophon] _De Rep. Lac._ 7. § 1.\r\n\r\n  [78] [Xenophon] _De Rep. Lac._ 7. § 5.\r\n\r\nAs every Spartan was a soldier all his life long from attaining\r\nmanhood till he was too old for service, the organisation of the army\r\nmust be counted among the important parts of the Spartan institutions.\r\nAt a great battle fought and won by the Spartans in the year 418\r\nB.C. the number of Spartiatæ on service was about three thousand one\r\nhundred. The force was divided into six regiments of five or six\r\nhundred men, each containing four smaller divisions, and sixteen\r\nsmallest divisions or companies, which last bore the name of ἐνωμοτίαι,\r\nor bands of sworn soldiers. Each regiment had its commander and so\r\nhad all its compartments down to the smallest: the commander gave his\r\norders to the officers next below him, and they to the commanders of\r\ncompanies: and it was only from these last that the orders reached the\r\nsoldiers[79]. The success of the whole system thus depended on the\r\nobedience of the lesser officers to their commander, and above all on\r\nthe efficiency and good discipline of the companies or Enomoties.\r\n\r\n  [79] All this is from Thucydides V. 66 and V. 68.\r\n\r\nThe drill of each company was carried to the highest pitch of\r\nperfection: this at least is clear from the description of their\r\nevolutions given in the treatise from which I have so often quoted[80].\r\nThe number of men in a company seems to have been normally twenty-five,\r\nsince two companies were sometimes called a fifty[81]: on some\r\noccasions it might be thirty-two or thirty-six. As it was usual at\r\nthe beginning of a war to call out all the Spartans who were below\r\na certain age[82], it is probable that none but men of the same age\r\nwere placed together in a company, since in the absence of such an\r\narrangement the proclamation of war might have divided each company\r\ninto two parts, one part going to fight and the other staying at home.\r\nAnd if each company consisted of equals in age we may conjecture that\r\nwhen a Spartan attained the age of manhood he was immediately sworn in\r\nas a member of a company, and with that company he remained throughout\r\nhis life unless he had to be drafted into another company to fill a\r\nvacancy.\r\n\r\n  [80] [Xenophon] _De Rep. Lac._ 11. The description takes up the second\r\n  half of the chapter.\r\n\r\n  [81] Thus in [Xenophon] _De Rep. Lac._ 11 a commander of two companies\r\n  is called πεντηκοστήρ or πεντηκοντήρ a captain of fifty.\r\n\r\n  [82] [Xenophon] _De Rep. Lac._ 11: at the beginning of the chapter.\r\n\r\nOn the march one company led the way and the others followed in order.\r\nWhen an enemy came in sight, each regiment was able by means of\r\nevolutions of companies to form itself for battle in the dense array of\r\nthe phalanx; and further by varying the evolutions the phalanx was made\r\nto face in any direction that was desired, and it was ensured that the\r\nfront rank was composed entirely of the very best of the warriors[83].\r\n\r\n  [83] [Xenophon] _De Rep. Lac._ 11. The description of the evolutions\r\n  there given is well explained in Smith, _Dictionary of Antiquities_,\r\n  third edition, vol. I. p. 770, under the word Exercitus.\r\n\r\nThe Spartan soldiers seem to have had no defensive armour except a\r\nlarge brazen shield: their dress was of a bright red[84] colour, and\r\nprobably consisted of a single large plaid which could be fastened with\r\na brooch at the shoulder[85]: for offensive weapons they had a long\r\nspear and short sword[86]. A regiment arranged in phalanx had a front\r\nrank of about sixty-four men as in the great battle in 418 B.C.: each\r\nof the ranks behind contained the same number, and there were in some\r\ncases as many as eight ranks[87]. For a body thus arranged the long\r\nspear for thrusting was obviously the best weapon: but the short sword\r\nwas also needed whenever there was a close combat between man and man.\r\n\r\n  [84] [Xenophon] _De Rep. Lac._ 11: at the beginning of the chapter,\r\n  στολὴν φοινικίδα.\r\n\r\n  [85] Smith, _Dict. Ant._ third edition, article Tribon.\r\n\r\n  [86] Smith, _Dict. Ant._ third edition, vol. I. p. 773.\r\n\r\n  [87] Thucydides V. 68.\r\n\r\nIII. We have already seen[88] that the Spartans in prehistoric times\r\nlived under a system of government which I have called dual heroic\r\nkingship: their political institutions were in most respects the same\r\nas those of the other Greeks in the heroic age, but they regularly had\r\ntwo kings reigning at the same time, each being head by descent of one\r\nof the two royal houses. After the establishment of the dual heroic\r\nkingship but still in the prehistoric age the Spartans introduced\r\nfurther modifications in their system of government: and since their\r\ndescendants, whether rightly or wrongly, believed that the wise\r\nlawgiver Lycurgus had been the author of these changes, the modified\r\nsystem of government is known as the constitution of Lycurgus. This\r\ncelebrated constitution is defined in a ῥήτρα or solemn compact said to\r\nhave been dictated to Lycurgus by the Delphic priestess and accepted\r\nby the Spartans: Plutarch has preserved a document which professes to\r\nbe the original text: and, though the pretensions of this document to\r\nextreme antiquity are probably unfounded, there is no doubt that it\r\ngives a truthful account of the government[89]. It orders Lycurgus \"to\r\nfound a temple of Zeus Syllanius and Athena Syllania, to divide the\r\npeople into tribes (φυλαί) and obes (ὠβαί), to establish a senate of\r\nelders, thirty in number with the commanders (i.e. the kings), to hold\r\nassemblies at fixed times between Babyca and Knakion, and so to propose\r\nmeasures and take decisions on them: and that the commons (δᾶμος,\r\nδῆμος, the whole of the Spartiatæ) should have (? the decision?)[90]\r\nand authority.\" Thus the constitution of Lycurgus retained all the\r\nthree component parts of the system to which I have given the name of\r\ndual kingship, the two kings, the council of elders, and the assembly\r\nof the people: but it prescribed that the meetings of the king and\r\nelders and people were to be held no longer according to the caprice of\r\nthe kings but at fixed times and between two places which were both in\r\nthe town of Sparta or close to it: the council of elders was to consist\r\nof exactly thirty members, the two kings being included in that number:\r\nand the assembly of the people was to possess authority (κράτος).\r\n\r\n  [88] See p. 35.\r\n\r\n  [89] Plutarch, _Lycurgus_, 6. The document, being in prose and not\r\n  ambiguous, bears no resemblance to the genuine utterances of the\r\n  Delphic priestess; and therefore I think not only that it is not\r\n  an oracle really delivered to Lycurgus but also that it was not\r\n  composed while the oracle of Delphi was active and the character of\r\n  its utterances well known: that is to say, before 450 B.C. or 400\r\n  B.C. I imagine it to be the work of some antiquarian, who knew the\r\n  Doric dialect extremely well: such a man might no doubt be found at\r\n  Alexandria during or after the reign of Ptolemy Philadelphus B.C.\r\n  285-247: for Alexandria was then the home of all sorts of learning,\r\n  and was the place in which, about the year 270 B.C., Theocritus the\r\n  greatest of the Doric poets wrote the best of his Idylls.\r\n\r\n  [90] The text is uncertain here.\r\n\r\nThe powers that belonged severally to the kings to the elders and to\r\nthe assembly are not defined. But the constitution was made in the age\r\nof the heroic monarchies and was derived from a dual heroic kingship\r\nby the introduction of slight alterations. We may accordingly assume\r\nthat in the system of Lycurgus, as in the government that preceded\r\nit, the important right of initiating measures was intended to belong\r\nexclusively to the kings and elders, and that the \"authority\" reserved\r\nto the popular assembly was no more than a right of voting Aye or No on\r\nproposals which the kings and elders submitted to it. In making this\r\nassumption we shall moreover be in agreement with Plutarch[91], who,\r\neither from such merely probable reasoning as we can use or on the\r\nauthority of some writer who preceded him, states that the kings and\r\nelders alone had the initiative. In course of time however the assembly\r\nattempted to amend what was put before it or to initiate proposals of\r\nits own, and a second enactment (ῥήτρα) was made to put a stop to its\r\nusurpations. From the stories of the wars with Messenia we learn that\r\nthe command in war was one of the prerogatives of the kings.\r\n\r\n  [91] Plutarch, _Lycurgus_, 6.\r\n\r\nThe first historical Spartan is Theopompus, who was one of the two\r\nkings at some time between 750 B.C. and 650 B.C. In his reign three\r\ngreat events took place: (1) the Spartans waged war against their\r\nneighbours the Messenians, defeated them, and made either a partial\r\nor a complete conquest of their country, (2) the general assembly of\r\nSpartan people was explicitly declared subordinate to the council of\r\nelders, and (3) the office of the Ephors or Overseers was created.\r\n\r\n(1) Somewhere about 650 B.C. the poet Tyrtæus was living at Sparta and\r\nwrote the lines:\r\n\r\n    Ἡμετέρῳ βασιλῆι, θεοῖσι φίλῳ Θεοπόμπῳ,\r\n      ὃν διὰ Μεσσήνην εἵλομεν εὐρύχορον.\r\n\r\ni.e. \"To our king Theopompus beloved of the gods, to whom we owed our\r\nconquest of the broad plains of Messenia[92].\" The subjugation of\r\nMessenia must have been a very difficult task: the country like the\r\nother natural divisions of Greece is protected by mountains and it was\r\ndefended by a brave and numerous race of Dorians. Tyrtæus tells us\r\nthat one of the wars against Messenia was carried on continuously for\r\nnineteen years[93].\r\n\r\n  [92] Quoted by Pausanias (IV. 6).\r\n\r\n  [93] Tyrtæus, Fragment 4. As the conquest of Messenia is a rare if\r\n  not a unique example in Greece after the purely legendary age of a\r\n  permanent conquest effected in spite of the obstacles interposed by\r\n  a mountain range, it is worth while to take notice of the geography.\r\n  The Spartans certainly did not cross Taygetus, whose lowest pass, now\r\n  known as the Langada Pass, is about five thousand feet above the sea\r\n  (Neuman und Partsch, _Physikalische Geographie von Griechenland_,\r\n  p. 181 note): to the north of Taygetus they could cross without any\r\n  trouble from the valley of the Eurotas to the valley of the Alpheius\r\n  (see the page just referred to): but before they could reach Messenia\r\n  they still had to march three or four miles up a valley with mountains\r\n  on either side of it and then to cross a barren sparsely wooded ridge\r\n  which unites Taygetus with Mount Lycæus. The ascent of the ridge takes\r\n  an ordinary traveller half an hour, so that the height of it will be\r\n  about five or six hundred feet. See Bædeker's _Greece_, p. 283.\r\n\r\n(2) We are informed by Plutarch[94] that, long after the establishment\r\nof the Lycurgean constitution, the assembly of the Spartiatæ took to\r\na practice of distorting and perverting the resolutions laid before\r\nthem by omitting or inserting clauses, and therefore the reigning\r\nkings Polydorus and Theopompus added to the constitution a new rule\r\nwhich enacted that \"if the people chose crookedly, the elders and the\r\nkings should have the final decision[95].\" Thus the general assembly\r\nwas rendered incapable of insisting on measures of its own initiation:\r\nthough it probably retained a right of veto on all measures which the\r\ncouncil might propose and was consulted whenever the state had to\r\ndecide whether it should undertake a great and important war[96].\r\n\r\n  [94] Plutarch, _Lycurgus_, 6.\r\n\r\n  [95] Plutarch, _Lycurgus_, 6.\r\n\r\n  [96] For example in 432 B.C. it was the assembly that decided on war\r\n  against Athens (Thucydides I. 67 and 87). The kings however, until\r\n  about 500 B.C., still had the right to engage in a foreign war, if\r\n  they chose, simply on their own responsibility (Herodotus VI. 56).\r\n\r\n(3) Plato (quoted by Plutarch) says that though Lycurgus had\r\nestablished a constitution of mixed elements, yet the Spartans after\r\nhis time finding that their oligarchy (the kings and the elders) was\r\nnevertheless too strong and was swelled and puffed up with power and\r\npride, set up the office of the Ephors to be a bit in its mouth: and\r\nAristotle says of Theopompus that he reduced the extent of the kingly\r\npower by the creation of the magistracy of the Ephors and adds \"They\r\nsay that his wife asked him whether he was not ashamed to transmit to\r\nhis sons less kingly power than he had inherited, and he replied: 'Not\r\nin the least: for the power will be the more lasting[97].'\"\r\n\r\n  [97] The passages are from Plutarch, _Lycurgus_, 7 and Aristotle,\r\n  _Politics_ V. 11. 2, 3. Bekker, Oxf. 1837. Welldon's translation, p.\r\n  392.\r\n\r\nBut I must pause for a moment: for there is a passage in Herodotus\r\nwhich in giving a rapid enumeration of the Lycurgean institutions\r\ncounts the Ephors among them and is therefore in conflict with the\r\nstatements of Plato and Aristotle. Herodotus was writing about\r\n430 B.C., Plato 400-347 B.C., and Aristotle about 330 B.C.: so\r\nthat Herodotus is the oldest of the three writers and, if other\r\ncircumstances were equal, ought to be preferred to the others. But in\r\nthis case other circumstances are not equal: for Plato and Aristotle\r\nmake their statements deliberately and emphatically: Herodotus does\r\nnot, but throws in his list of institutions as a sort of parenthesis,\r\nwhile he is thinking about many other things, and paying less attention\r\nto his parenthetic remark. These facts lead me to the opinion that\r\nPlato and Aristotle give us the true version of the oldest tradition\r\nand Herodotus does not: the opinion moreover is strengthened by the\r\nfact that Aristotle appeals to a story which must have been current\r\nlong before his time and was probably older than the days of Herodotus;\r\nand it is further supported by the negative evidence of the ῥήτρα,\r\nwhich in defining the Lycurgean constitution says not a word about\r\nEphors.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to determine what was the original character of the\r\nmagistracy of the Ephors: we do not know what were their functions, how\r\nthey were appointed or elected, nor for what term they held office:\r\nbut, from the passages which have just been referred to, it is certain\r\nthat Plato and Aristotle believed that the power acquired by the Ephors\r\ndiminished the power of the kings and the elders. The name Ephors or\r\nOverseers implies that they exercised some kind of supervision over the\r\ngovernment or some part of it.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be doubted that the three important events of the reign of\r\nTheopompus were in some way connected with one another. In the midst\r\nof a great war for the conquest of Messenia, it might be especially\r\ninconvenient that the assembly of the Spartiatæ should initiate\r\nproposals of its own: for the men who made up the assembly were the\r\nvery same who formed the whole of the Spartan army. And again in\r\nthe settlement of the affairs of Messenia it was not desirable that\r\nthe kings and the council should be entirely uncontrolled, as they\r\nwould have been after the assembly had been deprived of the power of\r\ninitiating measures, if no Ephors had been appointed.\r\n\r\nIt is stated by Plutarch that the twenty-eight elders who with the\r\nkings formed the council were elected by the general assembly of\r\nthe Spartans[98]: and the method of election which he describes is\r\nso extremely primitive that it probably belongs to the original\r\nconstitution or dates from the times of Theopompus. When a councillor\r\ndied the best man among those over sixty years of age was to be chosen\r\nto take his place. The people came together in assembly: certain\r\nselected men were shut up in a neighbouring building whence they\r\ncould see nothing: the candidates were brought one by one before the\r\nassembly, but in an order which was unknown to the men in the building,\r\nand each as he entered was greeted with shouting: the men in the\r\nbuilding decided that the cheering had been loudest for the man who\r\ncame first, or the man who came second, or some other in the order:\r\nand the man, unknown to themselves, for whom they thus pronounced, was\r\nproclaimed as the new member of the council.\r\n\r\n [98] Plutarch, _Lycurgus_, 26.\r\n\r\nThe parts then of the Spartan government from the time of Theopompus\r\nonwards were the kings, the council of elders, the Ephors, and the\r\nassembly of warriors. Until about 500 B.C. the chief power belonged to\r\nthe kings or to the kings and the council of elders: the kings had the\r\nactive management and direction of foreign affairs[99].\r\n\r\n  [99] Smith's _Dictionary of Antiquities_, third edition, article\r\n  Ephori, where proofs are given.\r\n\r\nAbout that time and soon afterwards we meet with several reigns that\r\nmight account for a diminution of the kingly power. In one of the regal\r\nhouses there were Cleomenes I. (519-491 B.C.) and Pleistarchus (480-458\r\nB.C.): in the other Leotychidas (491-461 B.C.). Cleomenes contrived\r\nthe unfair deposition of Demaratus, was half insane for some time\r\nbefore his death, and slew himself in a fit of madness. Pleistarchus\r\nwas a little child at the death of his father Leonidas the hero of\r\nThermopylæ: his guardian was Pausanias, who tried to betray Sparta\r\ninto the power of the Persian king. Leotychidas was brought into royal\r\npower, without any sound title, by the intrigues of Cleomenes. Whatever\r\nmay have been the causes of the decline of the kingly prerogative,\r\nit is certain that between 500 B.C. and 467 B.C. the Ephors rose to\r\nsupreme power at Sparta: they sat in judgement on king Cleomenes I. on\r\nan accusation of bribery, they imprisoned the regent Pausanias (about\r\n467 B.C.) on suspicion of treason, and above all, in the year 479 B.C.,\r\nit was on their own sole responsibility that they despatched the great\r\narmament to resist Mardonius in Bœotia[100]. The power which they then\r\npossessed they never lost till the decline of Sparta in the third\r\ncentury B.C., except perhaps during the reign of an unusually able king\r\nsuch as Agesilaus (398-361 B.C.).\r\n\r\n  [100] For Cleomenes, see Herodotus VI. 73-82: for Pausanias,\r\n  Thucydides I. 131. 3: for the sending of the great armament, Herodotus\r\n  IX. chapters 10, 11, 28: and above, page 38.\r\n\r\nIt has already been remarked that in the period from Theopompus to\r\nabout 500 B.C. we do not know how the Ephors were appointed or elected:\r\nin the time of Aristotle (about 330 B.C.) they were elected from the\r\nwhole body of Spartan citizens, and no doubt by the whole body of\r\nSpartan citizens[101]. They must have been thus elected as early as\r\nthe time of Cleomenes I.: for if they had been appointed by the kings\r\nor the council of elders they could not have gained that independence\r\nwhich they then displayed.\r\n\r\n  [101] Aristotle, _Politics_ II. 9. 19 γίγνονται ἐκ τοῦ δήμου πάντες\r\n  (they are all created from the people). _Ibid._ II. 9. 23 (αἱρετὴν τὴν\r\n  ἀρχὴν ἐξ ἁπάντων), (the office is filled by election from the whole\r\n  body).\r\n\r\nDuring the period of their greatness (beginning about 480 B.C.) the\r\nEphors were a board of five[102] magistrates elected annually. One\r\nof them gave his name to the year[103]: they received ambassadors and\r\nsometimes at least gave them an answer[104]: they could, as we have\r\nseen, send out an armament to a foreign war and fix what troops should\r\ngo, and whenever it chanced that the assembly of the Spartiatæ was\r\ncalled together an Ephor presided over it and took the votes[105].\r\n\r\n  [102] Aristotle, _Politics_ II. 10. 6.\r\n\r\n  [103] Xenophon, _Hellenica_ II. 3. §§ 9 and 10.\r\n\r\n  [104] The ambassadors sent by the Athenians in their extreme distress\r\n  during the occupation of Athens by Mardonius were received by the\r\n  Ephors and were kept waiting ten days for an answer. Herodotus IX.\r\n  7-11.\r\n\r\n  [105] For example in 432 B.C. Thucydides I. 85-87.\r\n\r\nThe kings in time of peace were dignitaries without power: at\r\nsacrificial feasts and athletic contests they took the seats of honour\r\nand after a sacrifice the skins of the victims were their perquisite:\r\nthe state provided them with regular monthly allowances of food: they\r\nsuperintended religious matters, and settled what Spartan citizens\r\nshould be the πρόξενοι or befrienders of visitors to Sparta from\r\nthe various Greek states: and they had jurisdiction about marriages\r\nof heiresses, public ways, and adoption of children: but with these\r\nexceptions all control of home affairs had passed from the kings to the\r\nEphors[106]. In time of war the kings were commanders of the Spartan\r\narmies, and the history of Agesilaus shows that in this capacity they\r\nmight gain high distinction and influence: but the expeditions of the\r\nSpartans were usually accompanied by some of the Ephors[107], who could\r\nafterwards report to their colleagues any action of the commander which\r\ndispleased them.\r\n\r\n  [106] For the powers of the kings in time of peace see Herodotus VI.\r\n  57.\r\n\r\n  [107] [Xenophon] _De Rep. Lac._ 13. § 5.\r\n\r\nUntil the beginning of the Peloponnesian war in 432 B.C., it seems that\r\nthe government, whether it was controlled by the kings, the council,\r\nor the Ephors, was faithfully conducted for the interests of the\r\nwhole of the little community of the Spartiatæ. We do not hear of the\r\nrulers living in luxury, nor of inequalities or discontents among the\r\nSpartiatæ, nor of emancipations of Helots. Twice only in the course\r\nof several centuries we read that the Spartans made a new law[108]:\r\nin foreign policy they were unenterprising: and they seem to have\r\ndevoted themselves to the cultivation of the military virtues enjoined\r\nby their traditions, and to looking after their interests at home,\r\nwhich consisted largely in keeping down, degrading and humiliating the\r\nMessenians and the other Helots.\r\n\r\n  [108] Smith, _Dict. Ant._, third edition, vol. I. p. 915.\r\n\r\nIV. While the Spartans were waging their great war against the\r\nAthenians (432-404 B.C.) and afterwards when they were enjoying the\r\nadvantages which their success procured for them, many alterations\r\nwere gradually introduced in their customs and government. Helots\r\nwere emancipated for service as soldiers: inequalities arose among\r\nthe Spartiatæ, some of them acquiring great fortunes as regulators\r\n(harmosts) in foreign cities, others sinking to poverty and losing\r\ntheir civic rights: and the Ephors used their time of office for the\r\ngetting of wealth and enjoyment of luxury.\r\n\r\nHelots had been employed as light-armed soldiers attending on the\r\nheavy-armed Spartiatæ as early as the battle of Platæa in 479 B.C.: in\r\nthe first years of the Peloponnesian war some of them had distinguished\r\nthemselves in the field, and in the eighth year of the war (in the\r\nbeginning of 424 B.C.) the Spartans, fearing they might be dangerous,\r\nthought of sending them on foreign service. This plan of removing\r\nthem was not carried into effect: but a proclamation was put out that\r\nthose Helots who were conscious of having done good service in the war\r\nmight apply for their freedom: two thousand were selected and were\r\nemancipated with striking solemnities: but within a short time most\r\nof them disappeared, no one knew how, by secret assassination[109].\r\nThis first liberation of Helots ended in treachery and murder: but\r\nafterwards emancipations were frequently made in good faith. The men\r\nwho were raised from serfdom did not become Periœci but were known as\r\nνεοδαμώδεις, or \"men resembling new commoners.\"\r\n\r\n  [109] Thucydides IV. 80.\r\n\r\nBodies of Neodamodês are mentioned by Thucydides as existing in the\r\nyears 421, 418, 413, 412 B.C.[110]: and in one of the occasions where\r\nhe speaks of Neodamodês and Helots as serving together he explains the\r\ndifference between the two by remarking that \"the word Neodamodês\r\nsignifies that freedom has been already acquired,\" thus proving for\r\ncertain that a Neodamodês was an emancipated Helot[111]. After the end\r\nof the war the Neodamodês became more numerous: in the year 399 B.C.\r\nthe Spartans sent out a thousand under Thimbron to Asia Minor at the\r\nrequest of the Asiatic Greek cities[112].\r\n\r\n  [110] Thucydides V. 34, V. 67, VII. 19, VII. 58, VIII. 5.\r\n\r\n  [111] Thucydides VII. 58 δύναται δὲ τὸ Νεοδαμῶδες ἐλευθερον ἤδη εἶναι.\r\n\r\n  [112] Xenophon, _Hellenica_ III. 1. 4.\r\n\r\nIn 398 or 397 B.C., before Agesilaus had reigned a whole year, a\r\nconspiracy against the Spartan government was set on foot by a man\r\nnamed Cinadon. Xenophon in his account of its detection says that\r\nCinadon was a young man and vigorous in body and mind but was not one\r\nof the Equals (οὐ μέντοι τῶν ὁμοίων). When the informer was questioned\r\nby the Ephors, he said Cinadon had expressed confidence that many of\r\nthe Helots, the Neodamodês, the Inferiors (οἱ ὑπομείονες), and the\r\nPeriœci were in sympathy with his aims: for whenever men of these\r\nclasses talked about the Spartiatæ, they could not conceal that they\r\nwould like to eat them raw[113]. The story shows that the Equals were\r\nthe highest of all the classes at Sparta, and that the Inferiors, being\r\ndistinct from the Helots, the Neodamodês and the Periœci, were men who\r\nhad been Spartiatæ but had lost their position. The difference between\r\nthe Equals and the Inferiors is but imperfectly known. Aristotle tells\r\nus that any Spartan who was unable to pay his share of the cost of the\r\npublic mess-table was deprived of his rights as a citizen, and many\r\nhad thus been disfranchised[114]. From this we may infer that anyone\r\nwho sank into the ranks of the Inferiors lost not only his vote in\r\nthe assembly, which was of little value, as the assemblies were not\r\ninfluential, but also his right of being trained as a Spartan: hence he\r\nwould have but a poor chance of rising to military distinction or of\r\nobtaining any position of importance.\r\n\r\n  [113] Xenophon, _Hellenica_ III. 3. 5 and 6.\r\n\r\n  [114] Aristotle, _Politics_ II. 9. 31 and 32. Welldon, _Translation_,\r\n  p. 83.\r\n\r\nWhen the Peloponnesian war ended in 404 B.C., the cities of Asia and\r\nthe Ægean sea came under the power of Sparta. To each city a harmost or\r\nregulator was sent to establish an oligarchical government consisting\r\nusually of a decarchy or board of ten citizens distinguished for\r\nservility towards the Spartans and readiness to punish any sign of\r\npatriotic spirit with death or banishment and confiscation. Besides the\r\nharmosts, military detachments were sent to enforce the wishes of the\r\nSpartans in their new possessions: both the harmosts and the military\r\ncommanders were harsh governors, and some of them amassed large\r\nfortunes by extortion[115]. They took home the wealth that they had\r\nacquired and thus introduced the inequalities among the Spartiatæ which\r\nwere so conspicuous and so invidious in the time of Cinadon.\r\n\r\n  [115] For the harmosts see Xenophon, _Hellenica_ III. 5. § 13.\r\n\r\nThe supremacy which the Spartans acquired in 404 B.C. was lost again\r\nin 371 B.C. In that year an army with which they invaded Bœotia was\r\nseverely defeated by the Thebans under Epaminondas; the victorious\r\ngeneral marched into the Peloponnesus, deprived the Spartans of\r\nMessenia, and, summoning from all parts the descendants of Messenians\r\nwho had gone into exile, established them as an independent people in\r\nthe new city of Messenê on the site of the old stronghold of Ithomê.\r\nAt the same time he founded the Arcadian city of Megalê Polis (in\r\nLatin Megalopolis) to bar the way between the Spartans and their old\r\nallies the Eleians: and in the year 369 B.C. he ensured the permanence\r\nof his work by winning the decisive battle of Mantineia. The Spartans\r\nwere reduced lower than they had been for two centuries: but adversity\r\ndid not restore them to what they had been before the days of their\r\nprosperity. The number of men possessed of wealth, small already,\r\nsteadily became smaller, so that in the reign of Agis IV. (about 243\r\nB.C.) the whole number of the Spartiatæ did not exceed seven hundred;\r\nof these only about a hundred were landowners, and the rest were\r\nreduced to poverty and distress[116].\r\n\r\n  [116] Plutarch, _Agis_ 5.\r\n\r\nThe office of the Ephors shared in the general deterioration of the\r\nSpartan commonwealth, and Aristotle (writing about 330 B.C.) speaks of\r\nit with some severity. We can indeed see from his remarks that access\r\nto the office was not obtained by bribery, for very poor citizens\r\nwere frequently chosen: the election was conducted under a system\r\nwhich seemed to him very puerile, but which did not close the door\r\nto poverty. On the other hand the Ephors when in office frequently\r\naccepted bribes: and he says that on one occasion they did all that in\r\nthem lay towards the ruin of the state. They often spent the wealth\r\nthat they got by such dishonest means in leading a life of extreme\r\nself-indulgence, in strong contrast with the hardships which the poorer\r\ncitizens endured[117].\r\n\r\n  [117] Aristotle, _Politics_ II. 9. 19-24. Welldon, pp. 80, 81.\r\n\r\nWe may now sum up the results of our observations of the Spartans and\r\ntheir institutions. From the earliest times they devoted themselves to\r\nacquiring and cultivating those qualities which would enable them to\r\nexcel as a people of conquerors and of slave-owners: but in doing this\r\nthey lost most of the other virtues, and especially the qualities which\r\nmake intelligent citizens. There were few political questions in which\r\nthe Spartans took any interest: they did not make new laws; they had no\r\ncommerce, no gold or silver except in the treasury of the state: the\r\nonly subjects debated in their assemblies were questions of war, peace,\r\nalliances, disputed successions to the throne, and the like: so that\r\nthe assembly did not meet save when such questions arose, or when one\r\nof the annual elections of Ephors came round. They did not even care\r\nwhat men were set over them as rulers: their method of electing Ephors\r\nwas childish, and the elections are generally if not always passed over\r\nin silence by the historians. Nor is their indifference surprising:\r\nfor their real ruler was, not the Ephors nor any living men, but\r\ntheir rigid system of custom and discipline: and under that system it\r\nmattered little which of them was in command and which had to obey,\r\nsince nearly every Spartan was competent to issue such orders as custom\r\nand usage dictated, and every other Spartan was prepared to obey them.\r\n\r\nIf this estimate is a just one, it follows that the really important\r\npart of the Spartan institutions was not the political part but the\r\ndisciplinary: that their discipline destroyed their capacity for\r\npolitical activity: that the Spartans from the age of Theopompus till\r\nthe Peloponnesian war were rather a military order than a political\r\nbody: and that they and their institutions cannot be very interesting\r\nor instructive to students of Politics, except as showing how a\r\ncommunity, which was originally political, may lose the characteristics\r\nby which political communities are distinguished.\r\n\r\nAfter the Peloponnesian war the Spartans got access to rich spoil at a\r\ndistance from their own country and began to think less of their common\r\ninterests as slave-owners at home, than of their individual hopes of\r\nplundering the inhabitants of the cities of Asia Minor. In consequence\r\nmany of the Helots were emancipated to serve as soldiers in foreign\r\nwar, and the intensity of the oppression of the rest was probably\r\ndiminished: while on the other hand each individual Spartan acted no\r\nlonger for the common good of the Spartiatæ but for the sole good of\r\nhimself, and the government was conducted in the interest not of the\r\nwhole ruling caste but of that smaller number among them who had been\r\nsuccessful in enriching themselves.\r\n\r\n _Note._ I do not venture to follow Fynes Clinton (_Fasti Hellenici_\r\n vol. I. Appendix, chapter 6, page 337) in giving precise dates for\r\n the important reign of Theopompus and Polydorus and for the Messenian\r\n wars, because the passages which he quotes are taken from authors who\r\n lived after Myron of Prienê and who may have relied on his romances.\r\n There are however two genealogies of Spartan kings (Herodotus VII. 204\r\n and VIII. 131) which compel us, unless we assume either that in one\r\n royal house the generations were extravagantly long or that in the\r\n other they were abnormally short, to place the beginning of the joint\r\n reign of the two kings not earlier than 730 B.C., and its end not\r\n later than 650 B.C. We shall probably be right in placing the first\r\n Messenian war somewhere before 700 B.C. and in the reign of Theopompus\r\n and Polydorus: the second war may be placed somewhere between 680 B.C.\r\n and 650 B.C.: but further precision seems to be unattainable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE GREEK CITIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have already stated that between 650 B.C. and 338 B.C. the Greek\r\ncommunities with the exception of Sparta are to be classed as city\r\nstates, or communities in which a walled city is of supreme importance\r\nand the rural districts count for very little. It seems right to place\r\nthe beginning of the city states so early as 650 B.C., because at that\r\ntime three out of the four communities of which we have records were\r\nruled oppressively by bodies of magnates who lived in the cities or\r\nclose to them, and who owed their power to the protection of the city\r\nwalls and to the facilities for concerted action which they gained from\r\nliving close to a common centre. It must however be admitted that the\r\nevidence of the great importance of the cities is not so clear at the\r\nearly date which I have named as it is a century later, in the age of\r\nthe tyrants.\r\n\r\nThe examination of the political institutions of the Greek cities will\r\nbe divided into four parts: I. The early aristocracies and oligarchies;\r\nII. The tyrannies; III. The democracies and the later oligarchies; IV.\r\nThe conquest of Greece by Macedonia.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. _The early aristocracies and oligarchies._\r\n\r\nBefore the year 650 B.C. the heroic monarchies had ceased to exist\r\nin all the more important Greek peoples and other governments had\r\ntaken their place. Of the process of the change from the old tribal\r\nsystem to other systems we have no contemporary records in any case:\r\nand traditions even of a later date are absent except in regard to\r\nCorinth, Megara, Athens and Argos.\r\n\r\nAt Corinth it is said that in 745 B.C. the members of the royal family,\r\ntwo hundred in number, deposed the king Aristomenes, and took the\r\ncontrol of the state into their own possession, electing one of their\r\nown number every year to act as president and discharge the functions\r\nof king. They were distinguished by their descent from king Bacchis,\r\nwere known as the Bacchiadæ, and in order to keep themselves a distinct\r\ncaste they forbade all members of their family to marry any one but a\r\ndescendant of Bacchis. In 655 B.C., after they had ruled for ninety\r\nyears, their government was selfish and oppressive[118].\r\n\r\n  [118] Herodotus V. 92. Diodorus Siculus VII. fragment 9. Diodorus\r\n  wrote about 20-10 B.C.\r\n\r\nAt Megara we know only that the government was in the hands of certain\r\nrich families, and that eventually their oppressive rule provoked the\r\ncommon folk under the leadership of a man named Theagenes to rise\r\nagainst them and overthrow them[119].\r\n\r\n  [119] Aristotle, _Politics_ V. 5. 9, Bekker. Welldon, _Translation_,\r\n  p. 357.\r\n\r\nAt Athens the nobles gradually deprived the king of his power and\r\nprerogatives: and from a date somewhere between 700 B.C. and 650 B.C.\r\nthe government was controlled by a permanent council of nobles, and\r\nits details were managed by nine archons or administrators, who were\r\nselected yearly by the council[120]. The council consisted of those\r\nwho were serving or had served the office of archons[121], so that\r\nthe council in selecting new archons also filled up vacancies in its\r\nown numbers: among the nine magistrates the first in rank was The\r\nArchon, who gave his name to his year of office: the second was the\r\nArchon Basileus, who performed the religious rites: the third was the\r\nPolemarch, who commanded in war: the other six were called Thesmothetæ,\r\nand probably attended to judicial business[122]. The nobles then from\r\n650 B.C. or earlier were in exclusive possession of power: how they\r\nused it when first they got it, is not recorded: by 600 B.C. they were\r\nemploying it selfishly for the interests of their class.\r\n\r\n  [120] Aristotle, _Constitution of Athens_, ch. 8.\r\n\r\n  [121] Plutarch, _Solon_, ch. 19, Aristotle, _Constitution of Athens_,\r\n  ch. 3.\r\n\r\n  [122] Aristotle, _Constitution of Athens_, ch. 3, calls them recorders\r\n  of laws or customs for judgement. The chapter may be spurious, but the\r\n  assertion is probable.\r\n\r\nThe first truly historical Athenian is Draco, who, about 620 B.C.,\r\ncollected the customary law of Athens and formed it, together with some\r\nprovisions of his own, into a written code of legal regulations. The\r\nnewly recovered Aristotelian treatise on the constitution of Athens\r\ncontains a passage which also attributes to him some very important\r\nchanges in the structure of the government[123]: but, as this passage\r\nwas certainly either not known or not accepted as genuine by Plutarch\r\nin the first century A.D. and Pollux in the second century, though they\r\nwere well acquainted with Aristotle's treatise, it seems impossible to\r\nregard it as an original part of the work[124].\r\n\r\n  [123] Aristotle, _Constitution of Athens_, 4.\r\n\r\n  [124] Mr R. Macan in _Journ. of Hellenic Studies_, April 1891, p. 27\r\n  notices the silence of Plutarch.\r\n\r\nWhether Draco did or did not attempt to reform the government, he\r\ndid not put an end to the oppressive practices of the nobles and the\r\nwealthy. They took advantage of the harsh laws relating to debt, to\r\ndeprive the poorer freemen of their lands or to reduce them to slavery:\r\nbut the poor showed so much inclination for fighting that their\r\noppressors were alarmed. In the year 594 B.C. it was agreed by both the\r\ncontending classes that Solon should be elected archon and entrusted\r\nwith power to deal with the existing discontents and to make a new form\r\nof government. He cancelled all existing debts, restored to liberty\r\nthose who had been enslaved, altered the law in regard to security for\r\ndebt, and then attempted to remedy the defects of the political system.\r\n\r\nSolon devised a moderate system of popular government of the kind to\r\nwhich Aristotle afterwards gave the name of Polity. It was popular,\r\nsince the mass of the citizens had a controlling power: but it was\r\nmoderate, because no class had opportunities for governing in its\r\nown interest. His new institutions were the δικαστήρια or popular\r\nlaw-courts, the ἐκκλησία or assembly of citizens, the βουλή or council\r\nof four hundred, and certain regulations which made eligibility to\r\noffice depend on wealth. The archons kept their titles and functions:\r\nthe permanent council of ex-archons, henceforth known as the council\r\nof the Arêus Pagus (in Latin Areopagus), survived with diminished\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nThe δικαστήρια were courts in which large bodies of citizens sat as\r\njudges or jurymen: and Athenian citizens of all classes, including the\r\nThetes or labourers for hire, were qualified to serve in them. The\r\nextent of their jurisdiction is not precisely known: but as they were\r\nempowered to hear appeals from the decisions of all magistrates, they\r\nhad the final judgement in questions of the greatest importance: and\r\nas the laws were imperfect or uncertain, they could often be a law to\r\nthemselves. Under the oligarchy there had been no general assembly of\r\ncitizens or it had been as powerless as the common folk in an ἀγορή of\r\nthe Homeric age: Solon ordered all citizens to come together yearly in\r\nassembly for the election of archons. The choice however of the archons\r\nwas conducted by a process that was not purely elective: each of the\r\nfour ancient tribes, into which the Athenian families were divided,\r\nelected from among the richest class of citizens ten candidates for the\r\noffice, and, from the forty thus chosen, nine were taken by drawing\r\nlots. As Solon ordered that the laws which he had made should continue\r\nin force for a hundred years, we may infer that he intended that the\r\nassembly should for the present do little or nothing in the way of law\r\nmaking: but, in case it should be inclined towards unwise innovations,\r\nhe established as a check upon it his βουλή or council of four hundred.\r\nTo make up this council he selected a hundred men from each of the\r\nfour tribes; and, to give it a restraining power, he ordered that no\r\nproposal should be brought before the assembly till the council had\r\napproved it. His rules for eligibility to office depended on a division\r\nof the citizens into four classes according to their wealth. The\r\nrichest class were the Pentacosiomedimni, whose lands yielded in the\r\nyear not less than five hundred medimni (about seven hundred bushels)\r\nin aggregate produce of corn, oil and wine: next came the Hippeis,\r\nwho had three hundred medimni yearly and could equip and maintain a\r\nhorseman for warfare: then the Zeugitæ, who had two hundred medimni\r\nand kept a yoke of oxen: and lastly the Thetes, who were the poorest\r\nclass and worked for hire. The richest class were alone eligible to the\r\narchonship and the treasurership: the second and third class could hold\r\nlesser offices suitable to their condition: and the Thetes alone were\r\nincapable of holding places in the administration[125].\r\n\r\n  [125] The description of Solon's constitution is taken from\r\n  Aristotle's _Constitution of Athens_, ch. 5-13: except the statement\r\n  that the members of the council of four hundred were selected by\r\n  Solon. This is from Plutarch, _Solon_, ch. 19.\r\n\r\nThe constitution of Solon remained in full working order for only three\r\nor four years: then there arose violent contests about the appointment\r\nof archons, which show that the immediate effect of his changes had\r\nbeen to transfer the chief power to the nine magistrates[126]. The\r\nturbulence of factions made it impossible to enforce some parts of\r\nhis constitution: but other parts of it were probably observed, and\r\nthe whole served as a foundation for Cleisthenes to build upon. It\r\nis probable that the strife of classes which spoiled the working of\r\nSolon's institutions led to the restoration of some kind of oligarchy:\r\nfor if it was not so, it is hard to account for the readiness of the\r\npoor citizens to accede to the wishes of the demagogue Pisistratus.\r\n\r\n  [126] Aristotle, _Constitution of Athens_, 13.\r\n\r\nThe prevalence of oligarchical governments in the Greek cities of\r\nSicily at an early stage of their career is noticed by Aristotle[127]:\r\nthe existence of similar governments in the Greek cities generally\r\nin the same stage of their progress may fairly be inferred from the\r\nsilence of historians.\r\n\r\n  [127] Aristotle, _Politics_ V. 12. 13. Welldon, p. 405.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noticed that none of the traditions about the governments\r\nof the nobles in the Greek cities of the seventh century B.C. tell us\r\nanything about their behaviour or character when first they rose to\r\npower. From the probabilities of the case however we may conjecture\r\nthat at first they were good governments and used their power well:\r\nthey supplanted the long-established heroic monarchies, and could not\r\nhave succeeded in such an achievement unless they had had merits of\r\ntheir own. It seems then that during the first part of their existence\r\nthey ought to be called aristocracies rather than oligarchies: for\r\nan aristocracy is a government conducted by the few best men in a\r\ncommunity for the best interests of the whole community, while an\r\noligarchy is a government conducted by a few for their own selfish\r\ninterests. From what has been already stated about the governments of\r\nthe nobles in the later part of their careers, it will be seen that\r\noligarchy is a name which suits them precisely.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the chapter it was remarked that the nobles lived\r\nin the cities or close beside them, and owed their power to the\r\nprotection of the city walls and to the facilities for concerted action\r\nwhich they gained from living close to a common centre: and it is now\r\nnecessary to give authorities for the statement. Aristotle[128] speaks\r\nof the oligarchy at Athens as οἱ πεδιακοί, or inhabitants of τὸ πεδίον,\r\na little tract of level ground near Athens, Plutarch[129] calls them\r\nπεδιεῖς in exactly the same sense, and the Etymologicum Magnum[130] a\r\nmuch later authority says the Eupatridæ lived in the city of Athens\r\nitself. The oligarchy at Megara were overthrown by Theagenes: and he\r\nsucceeded in overthrowing them by catching them while they were taking\r\ntheir horses and cattle to graze beside the river[131]:--a fact which\r\nshows that when they went out into the open country they were caught at\r\na disadvantage, and implies that they habitually lived behind defences.\r\nAs to the Bacchiadæ at Corinth there is not any statement that they\r\nlived in the city, but Herodotus in a story which will be told\r\npresently explains carefully that a certain Corinthian who was not one\r\nof the ruling caste did not live in the city but in a δῆμος or place\r\nin the open country. The evidence for my proposition that at Athens,\r\nMegara and Corinth the cities as distinct from the open country were of\r\ngreat importance is not, I confess, very conclusive: but I have thought\r\nit sufficient to justify me in regarding the communities which lived at\r\nthose places as city states and not as tribes.\r\n\r\n  [128] _Politics_ V. 5. 9.\r\n\r\n  [129] _Solon_, ch. 13.\r\n\r\n  [130] Etymol. Mag., under the word εὐπατρίδαι.\r\n\r\n  [131] Aristotle, _Pol._ V. 5. 9. Welldon, p. 357.\r\n\r\nAt Argos the course of events was not the same as in those cities of\r\nwhich I have spoken. The Argive monarchy, as we have seen[132], was not\r\nabolished but continued to exist so late as 480 B.C.: the king however\r\nwas not a great power in the state: for we do not hear of any doings\r\nof any of the kings. On the other hand, the fact that the monarchy\r\nwas permitted to survive shows clearly that there was no oligarchy at\r\nArgos so violent and exclusive as the rule of the Bacchiadæ at Corinth\r\nor the Eupatridæ at Athens. Since then supreme power did not belong\r\neither to the king or to the nobles, power must have been in some way\r\ndivided, so that Argos had a mixed or balanced form of government: and\r\nthis fact is of some interest, since it adds something to the slight\r\nresemblance between Argos and Rome which has been already noticed, by\r\nshowing that in these two cities forms of government succeeded one\r\nanother in the same order. In each there was first a strong monarchy:\r\nnext an excessively strong monarchy or tyranny: and afterwards a mixed\r\nor balanced form of government. At Rome the three stages are marked by\r\nServius Tullius, by Tarquin the Proud, and by the division of power\r\nbetween patricians and plebeians: at Argos by the early Doric kings,\r\nby Pheidon, and by the mixed form of government which was established\r\nafter the decline of his power.\r\n\r\n  [132] Above, pages 34, 35.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _The Tyrannies._\r\n\r\nThe way in which the oligarchic governments were destroyed is\r\nillustrated by the successful enterprise of Pisistratus at Athens: the\r\ncharacter of the despotisms which succeeded them by the history of\r\nCypselus and Periander, tyrants of Corinth from 655 B.C. to 585 B.C.,\r\nand by the reigns of Pisistratus and his son.\r\n\r\nThe story of the origin of the Corinthian tyranny, as told by\r\nHerodotus[133], begins when Corinth was ruled by the oligarchy of the\r\nBacchiadæ. It was, as we have already seen, the custom of this family\r\nto forbid their children to marry any but a Bacchiad. But one of them\r\nhad a lame daughter named Labda, and, as none of the Bacchiad princes\r\nwould marry her, she was given to Eetion who was below the caste.\r\nEetion had also another wife: Labda had a child, but the other wife\r\nhad none, and Eetion, being discontented, sent to consult the Delphic\r\noracle. The priestess took no notice of what he asked but declared that\r\nLabda should bear another son who should be an important person. The\r\nBacchiadæ heard of the oracle, held counsel what they should do, and\r\nappointed ten men of their own number to go to the village where Eetion\r\nlived and to destroy the child. The ten men came to the house, went\r\ninto the court and asked for the new-born infant: Labda thinking they\r\nhad come out of kindness to congratulate Eetion, brought out her child\r\nand put it in the hands of one of the visitors. They had arranged that\r\nthe first of them that got hold of it should dash it on the ground: but\r\nit chanced, by luck sent from the gods, that the child smiled on the\r\nman who had received it: he took notice of this, and could not perform\r\nthe murder, but passed on the child to the second man, and the second\r\nto the third, and so the child was passed round all ten and none had\r\nthe heart to slay it. They gave it back to the mother and went outside\r\nthe house, reproached one another for soft-heartedness, and resolved\r\nto go back and carry out their commission. But it was fated that from\r\nthe seed of Eetion mischief should grow up for Corinth: Labda standing\r\nby the door heard their words, and hid the child in a κυψέλη or chest:\r\nhis life was saved, he received the name of Cypselus (Κύψελος), and\r\nwhen he was a man overpowered the Bacchiadæ, and established himself\r\nas tyrant. He drove many of the Corinthians into exile, reduced many\r\nto penury, and put to death many more. After a reign of thirty years\r\nhe was succeeded by his son. Periander, the new tyrant, at first\r\ngoverned gently: but after he had sent an envoy to Thrasybulus, tyrant\r\nof Miletus, to ask how he could best secure his power, and had learned\r\nfrom the envoy on his return that Thrasybulus had replied only by going\r\ninto a plot of standing corn and lopping off the tallest ears, he began\r\nto destroy the most distinguished citizens and became a more murderous\r\noppressor than Cypselus had been.\r\n\r\n  [133] Herodotus V. 92 and III. 48-53.\r\n\r\nThe character of Periander's government is exemplified in the stories\r\nof the spoiling of the Corinthian women and the seizure of the\r\nCorcyræan boys.\r\n\r\nAmong those whom Periander killed was his wife Melissa: a treasure had\r\nbeen committed to her keeping by a friend, and Periander after he had\r\nkilled her regretted that he had not first learned from her where it\r\nwas concealed. To repair his error he sent to the necromantic oracle\r\nat Acheron to question her ghost. Melissa appeared, but refused to say\r\nwhere the treasure was, complaining of being cold and naked, since the\r\nclothing buried in her tomb was no good to her because it had not been\r\nburned. Periander issued a proclamation inviting all the Corinthian\r\nwomen to a great festival at the Heræum: and when they came in their\r\nbest attire, the spearmen surrounded them and stripped them of their\r\nclothes and jewels, which Periander heaped together in a pit and burned\r\nas an offering, accompanied by his prayers, to Melissa. Her ghost was\r\npropitiated, and, appearing a second time, revealed the place where she\r\nhad hid the treasure.\r\n\r\nThe father of Melissa was Procles tyrant of Epidaurus. The two sons of\r\nPeriander and Melissa had no suspicion how their mother's death had\r\noccurred, till at the ages of eighteen and seventeen they visited their\r\ngrandfather at Epidaurus. When the visit was at an end, and Procles\r\nwas bidding them farewell, he remarked \"I suppose you know, boys, who\r\nkilled your mother?\" The elder son gave no heed to this: the younger,\r\nLycophron, after his return to his home at Corinth, would not speak\r\nto Periander, and was accordingly driven out of his house and went\r\nto stay with friends in the city. Periander forbade them to show him\r\nhospitality; and at last, to force his son to return home, proclaimed\r\nthat any one who spoke to him must pay a fine to Apollo. Lycophron,\r\ndriven from the houses of his friends, did not go home but went to\r\nsleep in the open air under the porticoes. After this had gone on three\r\nnights, Periander went himself and tried to talk his son over: but got\r\nno answer except \"You have incurred the fine to Apollo by speaking to\r\nme.\" Periander, seeing no other way of getting Lycophron out of his\r\nsight, sent him to rule over Corcyra, which was a colony of Corinth\r\nand, contrary to the usual practice among the Greeks, remained under\r\nthe government of the mother city. When Lycophron had lived long in\r\nCorcyra, Periander grew old and unequal to the task of ruling the\r\nCorinthians, and besought Lycophron to come and be tyrant at Corinth,\r\npromising that he himself would go to Corcyra. Lycophron, after much\r\npersuasion, was brought to consent, but the Corcyræans did not like\r\nthe prospect of the change and to make it impossible put Lycophron to\r\ndeath. The vengeance of Periander was worthy of a tyrant: he seized\r\nthree hundred boys of the best families in Corcyra and shipped them off\r\nfor Sardis to be made slaves and eunuchs to Asiatics and barbarians:\r\nthe commanders however of the ships which carried them were obliged\r\nto touch at Samos, and the boys were enabled to take sanctuary and\r\nwere afterwards through the kindness of the Samians restored to their\r\nparents in Corcyra.\r\n\r\nAt Athens, in the year 560 B.C., the chief contending parties were\r\nthe rich men of the plain, the men of the sea-shore, and the poor men\r\nof the hill country. Pisistratus, a young Athenian who had twice won\r\nmilitary distinction, having formed a body of partisans and declared\r\nhimself to be the leader of the men of the hill country, obtained\r\ntyrannical power over Attica by means of a trick. He drove into\r\nAthens in a chariot drawn by a pair of mules, both he and his mules\r\nbleeding from many wounds, which had been inflicted with his own hands.\r\nThe people were already assembled or came together to meet him. He\r\naddressed them and said he had been driving into the country and had\r\nbeen attacked by his political opponents: and went on to request them\r\nthat he might have some men to protect him. A resolution granting his\r\nrequest was proposed by Aristion and accepted by the assembly: before\r\nlong he and his guard of club men seized the Acropolis and he became\r\ntyrant. Twice Pisistratus was expelled from Attica in consequence of\r\nrebellions stirred up by Megacles, the head of the noble house of the\r\nAlcmæonidæ, and twice he recovered his despotic power. After his first\r\nexpulsion, he bade a certain woman named Phyê of tall stature and\r\ngraceful figure to array herself in a splendid suit of complete armour\r\nand drive in a chariot into the Acropolis: he sent heralds before her\r\nto make proclamation \"O Athenians, give good welcome to Pisistratus:\r\nye see that the goddess Athenê has honoured him above all men, and is\r\nherself leading him home into her own Acropolis.\" The people in the\r\ncity were thus persuaded that Phyê was the goddess Athenê, and were\r\ninduced to give good welcome to Pisistratus: he became master of the\r\nAcropolis, and his despotic power was re-established. After his second\r\nexpulsion, he spent ten years in exile: at the end of that time he had\r\ncontrived to amass large sums of money, and had gained the adherence\r\nof a strong force of mercenary troops and soldiers of fortune. At the\r\nhead of his army he landed in Attica and began reducing the country:\r\nthe Athenians marched out to oppose him but showed no vigour in their\r\nresistance: and before long he was admitted within the city. Then for\r\nthe first time his tyranny rooted itself firmly in the soil. Hitherto\r\nhis government had been mild and orderly: he had never tried to meddle\r\nwith the habits and home life of his subjects: and, as neither of his\r\nattempts to recover his power had been vigorously resisted, his rule\r\nmust have been regarded with favour by a large part of the Athenians.\r\nNow he began to rely on force and fear alone for the maintenance of\r\nhis authority. He surrounded himself with a strong body of foreign\r\nmercenaries: many of the citizens from fear of him went into exile: and\r\nthose who remained in Attica, in case they fell under any suspicion,\r\nwere compelled to deliver their children into his charge as hostages\r\nfor their good behaviour. And yet, even in this period when his\r\ngovernment was most oppressive, he never put a stop to the election\r\nby the citizens of the nine yearly archons according to the ancient\r\nconstitution, though he took care that one of the archons should always\r\nbe a member of his own family[134]. At his death in 527 B.C. he was\r\nsucceeded by his son Hippias, who for some years imitated the policy\r\nof his father by tolerating the maintenance of some of the popular\r\ninstitutions while he kept the substance of power in his own hands.\r\nAfter the unsuccessful conspiracy of Harmodius and Aristogeiton in 514\r\nB.C. his rule became harsh and repressive[135].\r\n\r\n  [134] Thucydides VI. 54.\r\n\r\n  [135] Aristotle, _Constitution of Athens_, ch. 19.\r\n\r\nThe fall of the Athenian tyranny was brought about through a foreign\r\nintervention. The wealthy family of the Alcmæonidæ had been forced at\r\nthe last restoration of Pisistratus to leave Athens and go into exile.\r\nIt chanced that the great temple of Apollo at Delphi had been destroyed\r\nby fire, and the Amphictyonic council, composed of delegates from the\r\nHellenic races, making great efforts had obtained money enough to\r\nrebuild it. The Alcmæonidæ contracted with the Amphictyonic council\r\nthat they would for a certain sum restore the temple: and to acquire\r\ninfluence with the Delphic priestess they performed the task with\r\nsplendour far exceeding what was required of them. After this, whenever\r\nthe oracle was consulted by the Spartan state or by any Spartan, the\r\nanswer was always the same \"Set Athens free.\" In 510 B.C. the Spartans\r\nresolved to obey the commands of the god: the king Cleomenes was\r\nsent to Athens in command of a Spartan army, Hippias was expelled,\r\nthe exiles restored, and the Athenians were free to establish any\r\nconstitution that they might desire[136].\r\n\r\n  [136] The stories of Pisistratus and Hippias are told by Herodotus (I.\r\n  59-64 and V. 62): see also Aristotle, _Const. Ath._ 14, and Plutarch,\r\n  _Solon_ 30. The temple of Delphi was burnt in 548 B.C. Pausanias X. 5.\r\n  5, 'Ερξικλείδου ἄρχοντος.\r\n\r\nIt was probably impossible for a Greek city, in the period when\r\ndemocracy was unthought of, to overthrow an oligarchy without setting\r\nup a tyranny in its stead. Tyrannies are found in all parts of the\r\nHellenic world in or about the sixth century B.C.: at Sicyon, Megara,\r\nEpidaurus, in the island of Samos, at Mitylenê in Lesbos, in all the\r\ncities of Asia Minor, in Italy at Rhegium, and in Sicily at Agrigentum,\r\nZanclê, Himera, Selinus, Gela and Leontini[137]. Most of the tyrants\r\nbegan their ambitious careers, as Pisistratus began his, by flattering\r\nthe poor and oppressed classes and professing to be champions of\r\nliberty[138]: some of them however started with being hereditary\r\nkings possessing limited prerogatives[139], others were high officers\r\nof state[139], or were members of an oligarchy[139]: but all alike\r\nwere usurpers of absolute power and found it necessary eventually\r\nto maintain themselves in power by employing a body guard of foreign\r\nmercenaries[140]. Pheidon of Argos, as I have already remarked,\r\ncannot properly be counted among the τύραννοι: the same may be said\r\nof Pittacus of Mitylenê with still greater confidence: for Pittacus\r\nwas in no sense a usurper, but was deliberately chosen as Æsymnetes or\r\npermanent dictator and endowed with absolute power by a vote of the\r\npeople[141]. If Pittacus were counted as a tyrant, Solon would have to\r\nbe counted as a tyrant also: for the powers conferred on the two men\r\nwere the same, and were bestowed on them for the same purposes and by\r\nthe same authority and procedure.\r\n\r\n  [137] Grote, Part II. ch. XLIII.\r\n\r\n  [138] Aristotle, _Politics_ V. 10. 4; and V. 6. 1. Bekker. Welldon,\r\n  pp. 381, 382, 358.\r\n\r\n  [139] Ibid. V. 10. 6. Bekker.

Welldon, p.\r\n  146.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of tyrants, or usurpers of absolute power, was\r\nnecessary to the development of most of the Greek states, because\r\nnothing else would have sufficed to destroy the oppressive power of\r\nthe nobles: and many of the new rulers for a time governed well and\r\nwere respected by their subjects. All however in time became selfish\r\nand cruel, and being detested by their countrymen were forced to hire\r\nforeign mercenaries to protect them. But no precaution on the part\r\nof the tyrants could avail them for long in the face of the general\r\nabhorrence with which they were regarded. Their dynasties usually\r\nlasted only for one or two generations: the most long-lived of all was\r\nthat of the Orthagoridæ at Sicyon which lasted a hundred years[142].\r\n\r\n  [142] Aristotle, _Politics_ V. 12. 1. Welldon, p. 402.\r\n\r\nThe feelings with which the memory of the tyrants was regarded in the\r\nlatter part of the fifth century B.C. when Herodotus wrote his history\r\nare shown by a speech which he puts in the mouth of a Corinthian\r\nnamed Sosicles. The Spartans at some time between 510 B.C. and 490\r\nB.C. conceived a project of reinstating at Athens the tyrant Hippias\r\nwhom they had helped to dethrone, and requested their allies to send\r\nambassadors to discuss the matter. The envoys of all the states\r\ndisliked the proposal: it was Sosicles who expressed the feelings of\r\nall. \"Surely\" he said \"the heaven shall be set below the earth, and the\r\nearth raised above the heaven, and men shall have their habitation\r\nin the sea and the fishes live on dry land, if ye, O Lacedæmonians,\r\nare preparing to destroy equal governments and to bring the cities\r\nof Greece under the rule of tyrannies, which of all things in the\r\nworld are the wickedest and bloodiest. If indeed ye think it good\r\nfor cities to be ruled by tyrants, ye should first set a tyrant over\r\nyourselves, and then seek to do the like for your neighbours: for\r\nif ye had experienced, as we have, what a tyrant is, ye would bring\r\nbefore us sounder opinions on the subject than those that ye have now\r\ndeclared[143].\" He enforced his opinions by telling a large part of\r\nthe story of Cypselus and Periander: and the effect of his words was\r\nsuch that the envoys at the congress declared their agreement with them\r\nand the Spartans had to abandon all thought of the restoration of the\r\nAthenian tyranny.\r\n\r\n [143] Herodotus V. 92.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that in the age of the tyrants the Greek\r\ncommunities were city states, or communities in which a walled city\r\nis of supreme importance and the rural districts are of comparatively\r\nlittle moment. In the case of Athens, the story of Pisistratus affords\r\nconclusive evidence: for in it we can observe three times over that,\r\nso long as his influence or authority extended only to the rural\r\ndistricts, he was but an aspirant to sovereignty: but, as soon as he\r\nwas master of the city, he was established as tyrant. And in the other\r\nGreek communities tyrannies were upheld by body guards of foreign\r\nmercenaries: and this could hardly have taken place if there had not\r\nbeen in each community a single fortified city of such importance that\r\na body guard by occupying it could dominate the whole country.\r\n\r\nBetween the tyrants of the Greek cities and the tyrants of the\r\nItalian cities of the middle ages there is a close resemblance: but\r\nthe tyrants, both Greek and Italian, differ in one most important\r\nparticular from all monarchs who have ruled over empires, tribes or\r\nnations. In an empire, a tribe or a nation the power of a monarch\r\nalways has some visible utility: in an empire he holds the whole\r\nstructure together: in a tribe or nation he repels foreign attack\r\nor leads his subjects to assail their neighbours: and above all,\r\nif his tribe or nation is successful and annexes new territory, he\r\nis supremely useful in amalgamating the people of the new territory\r\nwith his old subjects. To a tyrant all these kinds of usefulness were\r\nimpossible: the community that he ruled was too small to need holding\r\ntogether: it was too well protected by its mountain bulwarks and city\r\nwalls to fear much hurt from hostile invasion: it could not hope to\r\nconquer neighbours whose defences were as strong as its own: and it did\r\nnot acquire new subjects. There was, as we have seen, one momentous\r\nservice which the tyrants could and did perform for their cities, and\r\nthat was to put down the oligarchies and to ensure that they did not\r\nrise again: but, when once this task was performed, there was little\r\nelse that they could do, and their power became a mere political\r\nsurvival, or an institution which exists not because it is useful but\r\nbecause it has existed and has not yet been removed.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _The Democracies and the Later Oligarchies._\r\n\r\nBy the year 500 B.C. the tyrannies had disappeared from Greece proper\r\nfrom Asia Minor and from the Ægean sea: and from about that time\r\ndemocracies and oligarchies--the rule of the many poor and the rule of\r\nthe few rich--succeeded one another alternately in most of the cities\r\ntill the battle of Chæroneia in 338 B.C. put an end to the independence\r\nof the Greeks. My examples both of democracy and of oligarchy will all\r\nbe taken from the history of Athens: for the march of events at Athens\r\nhas been illuminated for us by Thucydides, Aristophanes, Xenophon,\r\nAristotle, Demosthenes and other great writers and orators, while of\r\nthe other Greek cities we have no knowledge beyond what can be derived\r\nfrom a few fragmentary notices. At Athens the period which we are\r\nconsidering was most unequally divided between democracy and oligarchy:\r\nthe government was oligarchic only for four months in 411 B.C. and for\r\neight months in 404 B.C.; throughout the rest of the time, a duration\r\nof nearly two centuries, it was steadily democratic.\r\n\r\nMy sketch of democracy and oligarchy as exemplified in Athenian history\r\nwill be divided into five parts: (1) Moderate popular government\r\n508 B.C.-480 B.C. (2) The changes between 480 B.C. and 432 B.C. (3)\r\nDemocracy during the Peloponnesian war 432 B.C.-404 B.C. (4) Democracy\r\nafter the Peloponnesian war 404 B.C.-338 B.C. (5) Oligarchies in 411\r\nB.C. and in 404 B.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Moderate popular government under the Cleisthenean constitution_\r\n508 B.C.-480 B.C.\r\n\r\nAfter the expulsion of Hippias a contest for power arose between\r\nIsagoras and Cleisthenes. Isagoras was a friend of the expelled tyrant:\r\nCleisthenes, finding that he was getting worsted, made an alliance with\r\nthe poorer classes and within three years after the exile of Hippias\r\nhe was victorious. Cleisthenes, like Solon, devised a new system of\r\ngovernment: and his system, like Solon's, was popular but moderate,\r\nand formed an instance of what Aristotle called Polity. He desired\r\nto grant the rights of citizenship to certain classes which did not\r\npossess them: and to this end he deprived the four old Ionic tribes of\r\nall political significance: for, as a tribe contained three φρατρίαι\r\nor brotherhoods, and each φρατρία--at least theoretically--contained\r\nthirty kindreds, each tribe was a close corporation consisting of a\r\nfourth part of the families of the Athenian citizens and would resist\r\nthe intrusion of new members[144]. He divided the people, for political\r\npurposes, into ten tribes constructed on a new principle and defined\r\nnot as containing certain families but as dwelling in certain demes or\r\nvillages: and he enrolled in these tribes, and thereby in the list of\r\ncitizens, a large number of men who resided in Attica, but were not\r\nof pure Attic descent[145]. It may be that each of the old tribes had\r\nformed a rallying point for one of those factions which had produced\r\nthe dissensions between localities and classes in the time before\r\nPisistratus: for Cleisthenes took care in his new division of the\r\ncitizens that the demes which formed a tribe should not lie all in one\r\ndistrict but some of them should be urban or suburban, some situated in\r\nthe inland parts, and others along the shore[146].\r\n\r\n  [144] The composition of the four Ionic tribes is from Pollux, 8. 111\r\n  (in Dindorf's or Bekker's edition). Pollux delivered his work in the\r\n  form of lectures at Athens in the reign of Marcus Aurelius who died\r\n  180 A.D.\r\n\r\n  [145] Aristotle, _Politics_ III. 2. 3, πολλοὺς ἐφυλέτευσε ξένους καὶ\r\n  δούλους μετοίκους. Probably the text is not quite correct, but the\r\n  general meaning is clear.\r\n\r\n  [146] For the geographical scattering of each tribe see Aristotle,\r\n  _Constitution of Athens_, ch. 21.\r\n\r\nThe whole body of Athenian citizens, greatly enlarged by the inclusion\r\nof the new citizens, formed the ἐκκλησία, or general assembly in the\r\nconstitution of Cleisthenes. The importance of the meetings of the\r\nassembly in the time before Marathon (490 B.C.) is proved by a passage\r\nin Herodotus in which he attributes the military successes of the\r\nAthenians in their wars with the Bœotians and Chalcidæans between 500\r\nB.C. and 490 B.C. to their newly acquired right of free and equal\r\nspeech[147]: for the right of free speech could not have produced such\r\neffects unless it were used in a general assembly.\r\n\r\n  [147] Herodotus V. 78. ισηγορίη.\r\n\r\nThe other parts of the Cleisthenean constitution have to do with the\r\norganisation of the army and of the council, with a strange and novel\r\nprocess known as ostracism, and with local government within the demes.\r\n\r\nThe military force under Pisistratus and his son had consisted of\r\nforeign mercenaries: Cleisthenes established an army of citizens. Each\r\ntribe furnished a brigade serving under the general whom the tribe had\r\nelected: at Marathon in 490 B.C. the right wing was formed by a body of\r\ntroops under the Polemarch and then from right to left the ten tribal\r\nbrigades were marshalled in order each under its own general[148].\r\n\r\n  [148] Herodotus VI. 111, whence the words are taken. Ar. _Const. Ath._\r\n  ch. 22.\r\n\r\nThe number of the council, which Solon had fixed at four hundred, was\r\nraised by Cleisthenes to five hundred, fifty councillors being taken\r\nfrom each tribe[149]. In the time of the Peloponnesian war, (as will\r\nbe shown further on,) the council of five hundred was a committee of\r\ncitizens entrusted with the duty of controlling the proceedings of the\r\ngeneral assembly: it considered resolutions and projects of law before\r\nthey were submitted to the assembled people: the fifty councillors\r\nof each tribe enjoyed for a tenth part of the year the dignity of\r\nπρυτάνεις or presiding officers, both in the council and in the general\r\nassembly, and the name πρυτανεία was applied both to their right of\r\npresidency and to the thirty-five or thirty-six days for which they\r\npossessed it: and, as the assembly met often and had much business to\r\nattend to, such a committee was obviously necessary. The records of the\r\nage of Cleisthenes give no details about the doings of the assembly and\r\nthe council: but the activity of the assembly, as we have already seen,\r\nbegan in that age, and it is natural to suppose that some of the later\r\nfunctions and organisation of the council may be referred back to this\r\ntime. The opinion is confirmed by a piece of evidence from Plutarch who\r\nstates incidentally that in 490 B.C. the tribe Æantis was the presiding\r\ntribe in the assembly which resolved that the Athenians should march\r\nout to resist the invader Darius[150]. It is probable that under the\r\nCleisthenean constitution the assembly met once in each prytany.\r\n\r\n  [149] Aristotle, _Constitution of Athens_, ch. 2.\r\n\r\n  [150] Plutarch, Συμποσιακὰ προβλήματα I. 10.\r\n\r\nThe process of ostracism was devised to guard the state against any\r\nfuture demagogue who might, like Pisistratus, aspire to make himself\r\na tyrant, and perhaps also against the recurrence of such a contest\r\nfor the chief power as had arisen between Cleisthenes and Isagoras.\r\nThe public assembly could, without naming any person, order that on a\r\nfixed date a vote should be taken in which each citizen might write on\r\na potsherd the name of any man who ought in his opinion to be banished.\r\nIn case the name of any citizen was found to be written on six thousand\r\nof the potsherds, he went into exile for a term of years but did not\r\nsuffer any further hurt[151].\r\n\r\n  [151] For the process of Ostracism see Grote, octavo edition, vol.\r\n  III. p. 133, cabinet edition, vol. IV. p. 83.\r\n\r\nLocal divisions and local governors had existed in Attica even before\r\nthe time of Cleisthenes: the divisions were called naucrariæ and\r\ntheir governors naucrari. We know nothing about them except that each\r\nnaucraria contributed two horsemen to the army and a ship to the\r\nnavy, and that the naucrari assessed the taxation needed for these\r\npurposes and had something to do in the expenditure of it. Cleisthenes\r\nestablished his demes as local divisions in lieu of the naucrariæ,\r\nin each deme he set up a demarchus or president of the deme, and the\r\ndemarchi took over the functions which the naucrari had hitherto\r\ndischarged[152]. Beyond what I have stated we know nothing from direct\r\ntestimony about the demes in the days of Cleisthenes: but there can be\r\nno doubt that even in his time the inhabitants of every deme used to\r\nmeet in assembly and the assembly regulated the affairs of the deme.\r\nThere had been a time when Attica was the home not of one state but\r\nof many independent commonwealths each having its own government[153]\r\nand its own divinities: and the people in the days of Cleisthenes had\r\nnot forgotten the fact, for their descendants eighty years later in\r\nthe time of Pericles still cherished its memory[154]. Moreover the\r\nAthenians even so late as the time of Pericles delighted in country\r\nlife for its own enjoyments[155], and even then a majority of the\r\ncitizens of Athens lived not in the city but in the country[156]: and\r\nif the attractions of life in the city did not draw men to desert their\r\ndemes and live in Athens in the time of Pericles it is certain that\r\nnothing that the city could offer in the time of Cleisthenes would\r\nentice them from rural to urban life. From all these considerations\r\nit is clear that the rural demes in the days of Cleisthenes were well\r\nfilled with a resident population: the resident inhabitants of the\r\nrural demes were citizens of Athens, and, as citizens, took part in\r\nsettling great matters of state: and it cannot be supposed that they\r\ndid not take part in regulating the comparatively trivial affairs of\r\ntheir own localities. In the time of Demosthenes about a century and\r\na half after Cleisthenes the assemblies of the demes were fully\r\norganised bodies and had plenty of business to employ them[157].\r\n\r\n  [152] See Smith, _Dictionary of Antiquities_, third edition, 1891,\r\n  article Naucraria. Aristotle, _Constitution of Athens_, ch. 20\r\n  κατέστησε δὲ καὶ δημάρχους τὴν αὐτὴν ἔχοντας ἐπιμέλειαν τοῖς πρότερον\r\n  ναυκράροις· καὶ γὰρ τοὺς δήμους ἀντὶ τῶν ναυκραριῶν ἐποίησεν.\r\n\r\n  [153] See p. 35.\r\n\r\n  [154] Thucydides II. 14, 16.\r\n\r\n  [155] Aristophanes, _Acharnians_, the whole play.\r\n\r\n  [156] Thucydides II. 14, διὰ τὸ εἰωθέναι =τοὺς πολλοὺς= ἐν τοῖς\r\n  ἀγροῖς διαιτᾶσθαι.\r\n\r\n  [157] Smith, _Dictionary of Antiquities_, third edition, article Demus.\r\n\r\nOne more change made by Cleisthenes is worth a passing notice. He\r\nordered the archons to be directly elected, and abolished all drawing\r\nof lots in their appointment. Twenty years later, in 487 B.C., the\r\nAthenians made the appointment more a matter of chance than it had ever\r\nbeen: they selected five hundred, and out of this large number the nine\r\narchons were taken by drawing lots[158].\r\n\r\n  [158] Aristotle, _Constitution of Athens_, 22.\r\n\r\nI may now give a brief summary of the political condition of Attica\r\nin the days of Cleisthenes. In Attica at that time, as in all parts\r\nof ancient Greece at all times, the population consisted partly of\r\nfree men (i.e. the citizens) and their families, and partly of slaves.\r\nIn matters of government the decision of great matters rested with\r\nthe assembly of all the free men: but, as most of the free men lived\r\nhabitually in the country and the assembly met only about once in a\r\nmonth, the management of current business was left to the Archons\r\nfor the year and the permanent council of the Areopagus composed of\r\nArchons and ex-Archons. The government therefore was a mixture of\r\ndifferent elements: for dealing with ordinary matters the governors\r\nwere a small number of the ablest men, while for dealing with matters\r\nof special importance the rulers were the whole body of free men. In\r\nsuch a government there was no likelihood that either the rich citizens\r\ncould oppress the poor or the poor could oppress the rich: it was in\r\nshort what Aristotle afterwards called a Polity, or the rule of all the\r\ncitizens conducted for the good of the whole community. There is every\r\nreason to believe that no government with precisely the same qualities\r\nexisted elsewhere in Greece: for, if there had been one, Aristotle, who\r\nadmired such governments beyond all others, would have mentioned it in\r\nhis Politics.\r\n\r\n2. _The changes between_ 480 B.C. _and_ 432 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe invasion of Greece by the Persians under Xerxes and the subsequent\r\nmaritime supremacy of Athens produced great changes in the character\r\nof the Athenian government. When the Persians had passed over the\r\nmountains near Thermopylæ, Attica lay at their mercy, and the ten\r\ngenerals proclaimed that every Athenian must save himself as best he\r\ncould. The council of the Areopagus however contrived to provide a sum\r\nof money as an instalment of pay for men who were willing to serve on\r\nshipboard; a hundred and eighty ships were manned, and the men who\r\nserved, probably about thirty-six thousand in number, received a sum\r\nof eight drachmas apiece. The Athenian fleet, which was thus provided,\r\nformed more than half of the whole Greek force that won the marvellous\r\nbattle of Salamis: and the Areopagus was allowed by the Athenians in\r\nrecognition of the service it had rendered to have the chief influence\r\nin the government of Athens for twenty years[159]. But the whole body\r\nof the citizens who risked their lives in winning the great battle\r\nhad contributed more effectually to the result than the council that\r\nfound the money. Moreover within a few years after the defeat of Xerxes\r\nthe Greek cities in the islands of the Ægean sea requested Athens to\r\nbe their defender against Persian attack: from being protector of\r\nthe islands Athens soon became their suzerain, receiving from them\r\ncontingents of ships or payments of tribute, and possessing a maritime\r\nsupremacy and abundant revenue such as no Greek city had ever enjoyed:\r\nand all these brilliant achievements were due to the exertions of the\r\npoorer citizens who served as common sailors on board the galleys[160].\r\nAthens, Piræus and Phalerum were fortified and joined together by the\r\nbuilding of the long walls and were formed into a single city capable\r\nof containing a very large population. The result of these events was\r\na rapid progress towards democracy: the council of the Areopagus was\r\ndeprived in 462 B.C. of most of its powers[161], the rules which had\r\nhitherto excluded citizens of the poorer classes from holding the\r\narchonship were repealed or disregarded[162], pay was provided for the\r\ncitizens whilst serving as judges or jurymen in the law courts[163],\r\nand in various ways, twenty thousand--probably a majority--of the\r\ncitizens were in the employ of the state and received from it salaries\r\nor wages sufficient to maintain them[164].\r\n\r\n  [159] Aristotle, _Constitution of Athens_, 23. The drachma contained\r\n  the same weight of silver as a modern franc.\r\n\r\n  [160] For the effects of Salamis see Aristotle, _Politics_ V. 4. 8.\r\n  Welldon, p. 353.\r\n\r\n  [161] The Areopagus was deprived of power in the archonship of Conon,\r\n  i.e. 463-2 B.C. Aristotle, _Constitution of Athens_, 25.\r\n\r\n  [162] Plutarch (_Aristides_, 22) says that Aristides proposed to the\r\n  assembly a resolution that the archonship should be thrown open to\r\n  all Athenian citizens: and he seems to imply that the resolution was\r\n  passed, and that thenceforth any Athenian citizen, whether he was a\r\n  Pentacosiomedimnus, a Hippeus, a Zeugites, or a Thês, was legally\r\n  qualified to hold the office. It is however certain that no such\r\n  extensive change in the constitution was made in the lifetime of\r\n  Aristides: for Aristides died about 468 B.C. (see Clinton, _Fasti\r\n  Hellenici_ under the years 469, 468, 429), and Aristotle, in his\r\n  _Constitution of Athens_, chapter 26, tells us that it was not till\r\n  457 B.C. that the Zeugitæ were admitted to the archonship. If then\r\n  Aristides carried any resolution that altered the law, it did not go\r\n  beyond throwing open the office to the Hippeis or Horsemen. The Thêtes\r\n  or Labourers were never formally declared eligible: but in Aristotle's\r\n  time there was nothing to prevent a Thês from becoming an archon,\r\n  provided that on announcing his candidature he did not declare that he\r\n  belonged to the class of Thêtes. Aristotle, _Constitution of Athens_,\r\n  chapter 7.\r\n\r\n  [163] Pericles proposed and passed the payment of dicasts, during the\r\n  lifetime of Cimon, probably about 450 B.C. Aristotle, _Constitution of\r\n  Athens_, 27.\r\n\r\n  [164] Aristotle, _Constitution of Athens_, 24.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Democracy during the Peloponnesian War_ 432 B.C.-404 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe changes which have been mentioned, together with others which\r\nhave been passed over, produced the constitution under which the\r\nAthenians lived during their contest with Sparta. In the description\r\nof it we must notice (1) the general assembly and the council of five\r\nhundred, (2) the executive officers, (3) the judicature, (4) instances\r\nillustrative of the working of the constitution.\r\n\r\n(1) The ἐκκλησία or general assembly had supreme power in all the\r\nmost important matters: it consisted of all Athenian citizens who had\r\nattained the age of manhood: its meetings were held on the Pnyx, a\r\nhillside in the open air: four ordinary meetings were held on fixed\r\ndays in each prytany, and other meetings for special business could\r\nat any time be summoned by proclamation[165]. Though the assembly had\r\nsupreme power to make laws and pass resolutions determining the policy\r\nof the city, it submitted to certain restraining formalities. No law\r\ncould be proposed in the assembly till it had been considered and\r\nsanctioned by the council of five hundred[166]: and any resolution or\r\nany new law passed by the assembly might afterwards be indicted before\r\na popular law-court on the ground that it violated or contradicted\r\nsome existing law or was contrary to the Athenian constitution. If the\r\nlaw or resolution was condemned by the law-court it was _ipso facto_\r\ncancelled. Moreover, if proceedings were taken within a year after the\r\nvote of the assembly, the proposer as well as the proposition might\r\nbe indicted, and if the court decided against him he was subject to\r\na heavy fine. The Greek name for the indictment was Graphê Paranomôn\r\nwhich may be translated literally Indictment for Illegality[167].\r\nThe Graphê Paranomôn was, beyond all doubt, the best bulwark of the\r\nAthenian constitution: though there were occasions, as we shall see,\r\nwhen it did not save the constitution from being violated.\r\n\r\n  [165] The place of meeting is proved by Aristophanes, _Acharnians_,\r\n  line 20, ἡ πνὺξ αὑτηί, _Knights_, line 42, Δῆμος πυκνίτης and\r\n  many other passages: the number of ordinary meetings by Aristotle,\r\n  _Constitution of Athens_, 43.\r\n\r\n  [166] I do not know any evidence which proves directly that this\r\n  rule was in force at the time of the Peloponnesian war. But we have\r\n  already seen (page 60) that the rule was made by Solon, and it was\r\n  certainly in force in the time of Demosthenes (366 B.C.-322 B.C.): see\r\n  Demosthenes, _contra Androtionem_, p. 594, and _contra Timocratem_,\r\n  p. 715, especially the words πρῶτον μὲν ... πρὸς τὴν βουλήν, εἶτα τῷ\r\n  δήμῳ. Smith, _Dictionary of Antiquities_, article Boulê.\r\n\r\n  [167] The events of 411 B.C. prove clearly that the procedure by\r\n  Graphê Paranomôn was then an established part of the Athenian\r\n  constitution: see Thucydides VIII. 67, Aristotle, _Constitution of\r\n  Athens_, 29: and further on in the present chapter, p. 93.\r\n\r\nThe council consisted of five hundred citizens taken by lot. It was a\r\ncommittee to manage the details of the business of the assembly. It met\r\non every day in the year except the religious festivals or holidays\r\nand it drew up the list of business for the assembly, determining\r\nwhat business ought and what ought not to be brought forward. All\r\nbusiness intended for the assembly passed through the hands of the\r\ncouncil; and sometimes, in cases that demanded immediate action, (as\r\nin the accusation brought against the commanders at Arginusæ which\r\nwill be described further on,) it had to come to important provisional\r\ndecisions. The fifty councillors belonging to a tribe were presidents\r\nduring a tenth part of the year: and if, during their presidency, a\r\nspecial meeting of the assembly was required, it was their business to\r\nsummon it[168].\r\n\r\n  [168] The details about the five hundred are from Aristotle,\r\n  _Constitution of Athens_, 43. An inscription of the date 410-409 B.C.\r\n  printed in Clinton, _Fasti Hellenici_ (vol. II. p. 345), shows how\r\n  important the prytaneis then were.\r\n\r\n(2) The chief servants of the sovereign assembly were the ten generals\r\nand the nine archons. The generals were elected and not like the rest\r\nof the officers of the state taken by lot: this might be inferred\r\nfrom the constant occurrence among the generals of the names of\r\ndistinguished men, but it is completely proved by the fact that in the\r\nyear 430 B.C. the Athenians though they were many of them angry with\r\nPericles yet re-elected him general because his services could not\r\nbe dispensed with[169]. The ten generals levied troops, managed the\r\nrevenue allotted to military purposes, and named trierarchs to command\r\nthe ships[170]. In the battle of Marathon and in an expedition to Samos\r\nin 440 B.C. all ten generals acted as commanders: in most cases the\r\nassembly appointed a convenient number, usually three, of the generals\r\nto conduct an enterprise abroad, while the rest remained at home to\r\nmanage the ordinary business of their office.\r\n\r\n  [169] Thucydides II. 65.\r\n\r\n  [170] Smith, _Dictionary of Antiquities_, article Strategus.\r\n\r\nThe nine archons, taken yearly by lot from among a number of men\r\nwho had declared themselves to be candidates, and had submitted the\r\nrespectability of their characters to a public examination, had duties\r\nof a ceremonial character and attended to the routine of some business\r\nof state, but had no political influence[171]. There were also some\r\nother functionaries for the supervision of markets and of the supply of\r\ncorn, and for the preservation of order, of whom it is not necessary\r\nto speak further.\r\n\r\n  [171] Smith, _Dictionary of Antiquities_, article Archon.\r\n\r\n(3) The judicial bodies alone at Athens were independent of the\r\npolitical assembly. Jurisdiction, except in those few cases which\r\nwere still brought before the semi-religious court of the Areopagus\r\nor before the first Archon, belonged to the popular law-courts which\r\nhad been first founded by Solon. A large number of citizens were taken\r\nevery year to serve as jurymen: they were divided into bodies varying\r\nin number from two hundred to a thousand[172], and each of these bodies\r\nsat collectively as judges to decide such cases as might be submitted\r\nto them. They sat without any professional judge to inform them about\r\nthe condition of the law or the relevance of arguments: the advocate\r\non either side cited such laws as favoured his contentions, and could\r\nuse any reasoning which he thought likely to influence the court. The\r\ncitizens were not only willing but eager to render their services\r\nas dicasts, partly because they received as daily pay three obols,\r\na sum equal to half a modern franc, and partly because they enjoyed\r\nthe business of the court and the importance which it conferred on\r\nthem[173].\r\n\r\n  [172] Demosthenes, _Meidias_ p. 585, asks: \"What is it that gives\r\n  power and authority to any body of jurors sitting in judgement,\r\n  whether they be two hundred or a thousand or any number you will?\"\r\n\r\n  [173] The eagerness of the citizens to act as dicasts is ridiculed all\r\n  through the play of the _Wasps_, brought out in 422 B.C.\r\n\r\n(4) The records of some of the meetings of the assembly of citizens\r\nwill serve to illustrate the nature of their business. Just before the\r\nPeloponnesian war the Corcyræans requested the Athenians to protect\r\nthem with armed force: the body to whom the Corcyræan envoys made\r\ntheir request was the assembly of citizens; on the first day the\r\nAthenians heard the arguments of the Corcyræans and of their enemies\r\nthe Corinthians: on the second day they debated what answer they should\r\ngive; on the third they resolved to grant what the Corcyræans desired\r\nand thereby made the great war inevitable[174]. Again in 415 B.C. the\r\nambassadors from Egeste in Sicily, sent to ask aid from Athens, were\r\nheard in the assembly, and it was agreed on the same day to send an\r\nexpedition of sixty ships[175]. In the case of the Peace of Nicias in\r\n423 B.C. the negotiations were carried on by the ten generals, but\r\nthe Treaty became binding on Athens only when it was ratified by the\r\nassembly of the people[176].\r\n\r\n  [174] Thucydides I. 31 and 44.\r\n\r\n  [175] Thucydides VI. 8.\r\n\r\n  [176] Thucydides IV. 118.\r\n\r\nIn 428 B.C. Mitylenê in Lesbos, a city allied to Athens under\r\ncompulsion, broke loose from the alliance. This revolt was the work of\r\nthe oligarchy, which ruled supreme in Mitylenê. In the summer of the\r\nnext year Mitylenê had difficulty in withstanding the forces of the\r\nAthenians, and the rulers of the city found it desirable to give arms\r\nto the common folk. With arms went power. The common folk preferred to\r\nbe ruled by Athens rather than by those among their fellow-citizens who\r\nhappened to be wealthy, and declared they would surrender to Paches the\r\nAthenian commander. The surrender was effected, and the fate of the\r\ncity was to be settled by the Athenians. The Athenian citizens were\r\nvery angry that a city which had been in compulsory alliance with them\r\nhad revolted, and, making no distinction between the oligarchical party\r\nwho had led the revolt and the democrats who had restored the city to\r\nAthens, voted that every man in Mitylenê of military age should be put\r\nto death, and all the women and children sold into slavery; and they\r\ndespatched a galley bearing their orders to Paches. After the vote they\r\nwent home and repented of their cruelty: next day they met again, and\r\nafter hearing Cleon on the side of severity and Diodotus for mercy they\r\nrescinded the order of the day before and despatched a second galley\r\nto carry the new orders. The crew of the first galley made no haste in\r\nrowing, because they disliked the work of conveying a cruel and unjust\r\nsentence: and the second galley arrived with the new orders before the\r\nfirst had taken any effect[177].\r\n\r\n  [177] Thucydides III. 2 and 36-49.\r\n\r\nJudicial work at Athens belonged to the dicasteries and not to the\r\ngeneral assembly: but the assembly also if it wished to inflict a\r\npunishment on an offender against the state could do so by a special\r\nlegislative act which might be called in Latin a privilegium, and\r\nin English an attainder or bill of pains and penalties. Miltiades,\r\nafter he had won the great victory of Marathon, was entrusted with the\r\ncommand of an expedition of which he did not disclose the object: he\r\nused it wrongfully and unsuccessfully against the Parians, and on his\r\nreturn Xanthippus proposed to the assembly that he should be put to\r\ndeath for having deceived the Athenians. The assembly showed mercy to\r\nhim in gratitude for his services at Marathon, and let him off with a\r\nvery heavy fine of fifty talents[178].\r\n\r\n  [178] Herodotus VI. 133 and 136.\r\n\r\nIn the year 406 B.C. an Athenian fleet under the command of nine\r\nστρατηγοί or admirals won a great victory over a Spartan fleet at\r\nArginusæ: several Athenian ships which had been disabled in the action\r\nwere lost in a storm which came on afterwards, and it was suspected\r\nthat the admirals had made no efforts to save them. The Athenians\r\nsuperseded all the admirals and summoned them to Athens. Six of the\r\nnumber obeyed the summons. One of them was first accused in a law-court\r\nof peculation and misconduct in his command, and the court ordered him\r\nto be kept in custody, with a view probably to any further proceedings\r\nwhich the general assembly might choose to take. The other five\r\nappeared before the council of five hundred, which acted as a sort of\r\nbusiness committee to the assembly, and were committed to custody.\r\n\r\nIn a general assembly, held soon afterwards, a citizen who had himself\r\nheld a subordinate command in the fleet complained of the conduct\r\nof the admirals and desired that they should be punished. They were\r\nallowed to speak briefly in their defence; and the assembly did not on\r\nthat day pass any resolution except that the council of five hundred\r\nshould consider what course the proceedings should take, and report\r\ntheir opinion at the next meeting. During the interval a festival\r\noccurred at which many citizens appeared ostentatiously in mourning\r\nfor relatives who had been drowned in the neglected vessels. When the\r\nassembly met, the desire to punish the admirals had risen high: the\r\ncouncil, bringing in its report, proposed that, as the accusation and\r\nthe answers had been already heard, the assembly should proceed to\r\nan immediate vote whether or not the accused should be put to death.\r\nAn objection was raised that the established practice required that a\r\nseparate vote should be taken about each accused person: but it was met\r\nwith a clamour that the people ought to be allowed to do what it likes.\r\nThe objection based on established practice convinced some of the\r\nprytaneis or presiding councillors, but eventually all of them gave way\r\nto the clamour, except Socrates the philosopher. A formal proposal was\r\nthen made by a citizen, who shared the views of Socrates, that a vote\r\nshould be taken about each man separately. A division was taken on this\r\nproposal, and at first it was declared to be carried: but on a second\r\nscrutiny the proposal originally made by the council of five hundred\r\nwas accepted. A vote was then taken on the proposal that the commanders\r\nshould suffer death: the proposal was carried and the sentence executed\r\non the six men who were in custody[179].\r\n\r\n  [179] Xenophon, _Hellenica_ I. 6 and 7. He names only eight admirals\r\n  recalled. Grote makes the number nine.\r\n\r\nThe constitution, in the time of the Peloponnesian war, was arranged,\r\nin nearly all respects, according to the principles which the Greeks\r\nregarded as distinctive of ideal or extreme democracy, and tended to\r\nensure firstly that all citizens should be equally treated in the\r\ndistribution of offices, and secondly that the general assembly should\r\nbe free to do as it liked. The exceptions to the prevailing tendency\r\nare to be found in the appointment of the ten generals by election, in\r\nthe right of the five hundred to exclude a proposal from discussion,\r\nand in the provision that a resolution or new law might be indicted\r\nas unconstitutional before a law court. But the five hundred were not\r\nmen of greater wisdom or experience than the other Athenians, being\r\nmerely so many citizens taken at random by drawing lots: it does not\r\nappear from the descriptions which Thucydides gives of debates in the\r\nassembly that the generals or the five hundred exercised any commanding\r\ninfluence: and the illegal resolution against the admirals who\r\ncommanded at Arginusæ took effect, just as if there had been no such\r\nthing as a regulation that it might be judicially indicted.\r\n\r\nBut it must be observed that what was an ideal democracy in the eyes\r\nof the Greeks was not an ideal democracy according to the views of our\r\nown time. When we speak of a democracy we generally mean a system of\r\ngovernment in which the whole adult male population have some sort of\r\ncontrol over public affairs. At Athens, a large part, it may have been\r\nhalf, or three-quarters or five-sixths, of the adult male population\r\nwere slaves; and slaves, having lost their personal freedom, are of\r\ncourse incapable of political rights. If then we wish in speaking of\r\nthe Athenian constitution to use terms in their modern sense and not\r\nin their Greek sense, we must say that the rulers of Athens were not a\r\ndemocracy but an aristocracy: it is true that they constituted a far\r\nlarger part of the population than most aristocracies, but as compared\r\nwith the whole they were but few. And further we may observe that\r\nwithout slavery there could never have been such a government as that\r\nwhich ruled Athens. The Athenian citizens gave a large part of their\r\ntime to public business and attendance at public festivals: and they\r\ncould not have done this unless there had been plenty of slaves to\r\nperform the industrial and menial work that the community required[180].\r\n\r\n  [180] The observations contained in this paragraph were suggested to\r\n  me firstly by Professor Mahaffy, _Problems in Greek History_ § 38,\r\n  and secondly by Mr W. Warde Fowler, _The City State of the Greeks and\r\n  Romans_, chapter VI.\r\n\r\nAlthough Athens ought, according to the modern use of terms, to\r\nbe called rather an aristocracy than a democracy, it seems to be\r\ncertain that the men actually and habitually employed in the daily\r\nwork of government bore numerically a larger proportion to the whole\r\npopulation in ancient Athens than they have done in any other state\r\nknown to history. The whole population of Attica may have been a\r\nquarter of a million or it may have been nearly half-a-million: the\r\ncitizens numbered about thirty thousand, and it is probable that at\r\nleast ten thousand of them were habitually employed in the business\r\nof government: and these ten thousand may have been a twenty-fifth\r\npart and were not less than a fiftieth part of the whole population.\r\nIn modern England those who are habitually employed in governing\r\nwould include members of Parliament, of town councils, of county\r\ncouncils, and of school-boards, magistrates, judges, and the staff\r\nof all Government offices, except those persons who are mere clerks\r\nor servants: I cannot say how many they would muster, all told: but,\r\njudging from those parts of England that I know best, I should estimate\r\nthem at something between a two-hundredth and a five-hundredth part of\r\nthe inhabitants of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _Democracy after the Peloponnesian War_, 404-338 B.C.\r\n\r\nIn the period which followed the Peloponnesian war the poorer citizens\r\nwho predominated in the assembly passed several votes to promote the\r\npleasure and the pecuniary interests of their class. Pay was provided\r\nfor every citizen who attended a meeting of the assembly or was a\r\nspectator at a religious festival and its dramatic performances. The\r\npay was at first fixed at a low rate: before 392 B.C. it had been\r\nraised to three obols, the same sum as was paid to a dicast for a\r\nday's attendance[181]. The pay for the law courts, the assemblies,\r\nthe festivals and the council came to nearly two hundred talents\r\nyearly[182]. The whole revenue of the Athenian state in the fourth\r\ncentury is not known: but it can scarcely have exceeded eleven or\r\ntwelve hundred talents[183]: and thus it seems that about one-sixth\r\npart of it was spent in providing citizens with religious spectacles or\r\ncomfortable employment.\r\n\r\n  [181] The decrees granting pay for attendance at ecclesia are\r\n  enumerated in Aristotle, _Constitution of Athens_, 41. In the\r\n  _Ecclesiazusæ_, first acted in 392 B.C., Chremes (at lines 381-2)\r\n  says he had lost his three obols by being late for the assembly.\r\n  For the allowance to citizens at religious festivals see Aristotle,\r\n  _Constitution of Athens_, 28.\r\n\r\n  [182] See Boeckh, _Public Economy of Athens_, book II. ch. 13-14.\r\n\r\n  [183] See Boeckh, _Public Economy_, book III. ch. 19.\r\n  Supposing half a drachma was paid to 18000 spectators at 30 festivals,\r\n  to 8000 citizens at 50 assemblies and to 4000 dicasts for 300 days,\r\n  and a whole drachma to 400 councillors for 300 days, we get a sum of\r\n  1,190,000 drachmæ, and, as there were 6000 drachmæ in a talent, this\r\n  was equal to 198⅓ talents.\r\n\r\nAfter the three obols had been decreed, a majority more overwhelming\r\nthan ever was ensured in the assembly to the poorer class. The\r\nprofessional orators began to devote their skill to the purpose of\r\npersuading the ecclesia, and thus obtained a control over Athenian\r\npolicy. It was fortunate for the state that in Demosthenes it found\r\nnot only an orator but a patriot and a statesman: and it says much\r\nfor the good sense of the assembly that it followed his counsels,\r\nunless they interfered too much with the comfort of the individual\r\ncitizens. The assembly governed on the whole with moderation, and no\r\nharsh measures against the property of the rich were ever passed in\r\nit: but it insisted that the poor citizens should have their three\r\nobols for the religious spectacles, even when the money was wanted for\r\na most necessary war to defend Olynthus against Macedonia[184]. The\r\nvery frequent assemblies of the whole body of citizens gave the poorer\r\nclasses a decisive voice in all questions of policy and legislation:\r\nbut they also ensured that all the citizens had some knowledge of what\r\nwas being proposed, and gave them the habit of listening to arguments,\r\nand of deciding questions by voting and not by force. During the period\r\nfrom 404 B.C. to 338 B.C. Athens was never troubled with conspiracies\r\nor seditious violence.\r\n\r\n  [184] Grote, octavo edition, vol. VIII. pp. 81-98, cabinet edition,\r\n  vol. XI. pp. 138-157.\r\n\r\nThe fall of Athens occurred at the end of the period of which I have\r\nbeen speaking, and no doubt the defects of the constitution and the\r\nunwillingness of the citizens to make any sacrifices were contributory\r\ncauses. But it is not certain that, even if Athens had been as well\r\ngoverned and patriotic as ever, it would have been able so to unite the\r\njealous Greek cities as to ensure their independence against the new\r\nand formidable power of Macedonia.\r\n\r\nOur materials for forming an estimate of the nature of democracy in the\r\nGreek cities other than Athens are, as I have said, very scanty. But\r\nit seems clear that most of the democracies ruled with less moderation\r\nand self-control than the Athenian democracy, and had less stability.\r\nRevolutions from democracy to oligarchy or from oligarchy to democracy\r\nrecurred at shorter intervals in many Greek cities than at Athens:\r\nand sometimes, as at Corcyra in 427 B.C., and at Argos in 371 B.C.\r\nor 370 B.C., an unsuccessful attempt at revolution was punished with\r\nwholesale massacre[185]. It is to be observed that the Greek writers,\r\nin speaking of democracy, generally seem to regard it with distrust\r\nand even dislike: and this could hardly have been the case, if all\r\ndemocratic governments had been as well conducted as the Athenian\r\ngovernment. We know that at Athens the whole mass of the citizens were\r\nable at any moment to do whatever they liked, subject to no restraint\r\nexcept from the Graphê Paranomôn and from their own characters and\r\ninclinations: and it seems certain that in every Greek city mentioned\r\nby the Greek writers as democratically governed the citizens were\r\nstill more free from restraint: for many of the best and most careful\r\nwriters were great admirers of artificial restraints on democracy, and\r\nif any city had provided itself with such restraints the fact would\r\nhave been recorded. It is clear that a government which allows the mass\r\nof the citizens to do whatever they choose must be beset with dangers,\r\nunless the citizens have learned habits of self-restraint and mutual\r\nforbearance from a long and gradual political education. The Athenians\r\nhad learned such habits, but the other Greeks probably had not: for the\r\nAthenians alone among the Greeks had had the good fortune to live under\r\nthe wise constitutions of a Solon and a Cleisthenes, which, by granting\r\nto the mass of the citizens at first a very small share and afterwards\r\na larger share in the control of public affairs, provided them with\r\nsuch political training that eventually they were able with safety to\r\nexpose themselves to the perils of complete self-government.\r\n\r\n  [185] Thucydides III. 70-84. Grote, Part II. chapter LXXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. _Oligarchy at Athens_, 411 B.C. _and_ 404 B.C.\r\n\r\nIn the year 415 B.C., the seventeenth year of the Peloponnesian\r\nwar, the Athenians despatched a great naval and military expedition\r\nto the distant island of Sicily. The expedition encountered many\r\ndifficulties: the Athenians sent strong reinforcements: but in the year\r\n412 B.C. their fleet suffered a crushing defeat in the Great Harbour\r\nof Syracuse, and their army was afterwards completely destroyed.\r\nAthens itself was without any adequate defence of ships or sailors or\r\nsoldiers[186]: the Athenians did their best to supply the deficiency,\r\nbut there was grave reason to fear that their unaided efforts would not\r\navail to save them, and they greatly desired to get support by making\r\nsome new alliance. It was certain that no new allies could be found\r\namong the Greeks[187], and they could look for no help unless it were\r\nfrom the king of Persia[188].\r\n\r\n  [186] Thucydides VIII. 1.\r\n\r\n  [187] Thucydides VIII. 2.\r\n\r\n  [188] Aristotle, _Constitution of Athens_, 29, and Thucydides VIII. 47.\r\n\r\nAlcibiades, the ablest but the most unpatriotic and unscrupulous of\r\nthe Athenians of that time, was in 412 B.C. an exile from his native\r\ncity under sentence of death[189]. He had in 415 B.C. been appointed\r\none of the three commanders of the great expedition to Sicily: but,\r\nwhen it was on the eve of starting from Attica, he fell under suspicion\r\nof having committed a great crime by wilfully offending one of the\r\ngods who protected Athens and of designing to overthrow the Athenian\r\nconstitution[190]. As however there was no proof of his guilt, legal\r\nproceedings could not be immediately instituted, and he was allowed\r\nto sail as one of the commanders of the fleet: but when he reached\r\nSicily, he found awaiting him the Salaminia, the swift galley which\r\ncarried despatches, and on board of her some officers sent by the\r\nAthenian assembly to summon him home to stand his trial[191]. These\r\nofficers had been instructed not to arrest him but merely to bid\r\nhim come to Athens for trial: accordingly he sailed homeward in his\r\nown ship, under escort of the Salaminia. On the way the two ships\r\ntouched at a port in southern Italy, and Alcibiades went ashore and\r\nescaped from his custodians: soon afterwards, getting a passage to\r\nthe Peloponnesus[192], he went to Sparta and advised the Spartans how\r\nthey might best defeat the Athenian forces in Sicily[193]. The charges\r\nagainst him were produced before one of the popular law courts at\r\nAthens: and, as he did not appear, he was found guilty and condemned to\r\ndeath[194].\r\n\r\n  [189] Thucydides VI. 61.\r\n\r\n  [190] Thucydides VI. 26-28.\r\n\r\n  [191] Thucydides VI. 53.\r\n\r\n  [192] Thucydides VI. 61.\r\n\r\n  [193] Thucydides VI. 89.\r\n\r\n  [194] Thucydides VI. 61.\r\n\r\nWith the Spartans Alcibiades gained great influence, partly through\r\nhis intimacy with a powerful man among their Ephors, and partly by the\r\nsound advice which he gave them as to the best way to injure Athens.\r\nIn the year 412 B.C., at his own earnest desire, he was sent to act\r\non behalf of Sparta in some of the cities of Asia Minor which were\r\nin alliance with Athens, and to induce them to change sides in the\r\nwar[195]. Before long however the Spartans had reason to suspect that\r\nhe was betraying their interests, and sent an order to the commander of\r\ntheir fleet off the coast of Asia to put him to death[196]. Alcibiades\r\nwas warned, and, fleeing to the court of Tissaphernes, a powerful\r\nsatrap of the king of Persia in the south-western part of Asia Minor,\r\nbecame no less zealous and efficient in opposing the interests of the\r\nSpartans than he had been in promoting them: and, after winning in some\r\ndegree the confidence of Tissaphernes, he induced him to withhold a\r\nlarge part of the money which he had been in the habit of furnishing\r\nfor the pay of the sailors in the Lacedæmonian fleet[197]. Having\r\nthus completely destroyed his credit with the Spartans, he desired\r\nnothing so much as to obtain pardon for his offences from his own\r\ncountrymen[198]: for he hoped that, if once the sentence which had been\r\npassed on him were cancelled, he might return to Athens and recover\r\nsome of his former popularity and influence.\r\n\r\n  [195] Thucydides VIII. 11, 12.\r\n\r\n  [196] Thucydides VIII. 45.\r\n\r\n  [197] Thucydides VIII. 45, 46.\r\n\r\n  [198] Thucydides VIII. 47.\r\n\r\nAlcibiades knew that the Athenians were in a sore strait, and were\r\nlonging for an alliance with the king of Persia: and in this desire\r\nof theirs and his own friendly relations with Tissaphernes he thought\r\nhe saw the means of effecting his return: for, if the Athenians could\r\nonly be persuaded that he was able and willing through influence with\r\nTissaphernes to bring about the desired alliance, they would not only\r\nlet him return but would welcome him as a valuable friend in their\r\ndistress[199]. He believed however that his restoration could more\r\neasily be brought about if the present quiet and orderly government\r\nof Athens were to come to an end, and the city were thrown into\r\nthe turmoil of a revolution[200]. The surest way to cause political\r\ndisturbance was to try to substitute an oligarchy for the existing\r\ndemocracy: and this accordingly was what Alcibiades did, not that he\r\nliked oligarchy better than democracy, but because he thought that any\r\npolitical troubles at Athens might conduce to his restoration[201]. He\r\nsought for fit agents to bring about the desired revolution, and found\r\nthem among the officers of an Athenian fleet stationed at the island of\r\nSamos near the coast of Asia Minor[202].\r\n\r\n  [199] Thucydides VIII. 47.\r\n\r\n  [200] Thucydides VIII. 48, 3, ἐκ τοῦ παρόντος =κόσμου= τὴν πόλιν\r\n  μεταστήσας.\r\n\r\n  [201] Thucydides VIII. 48, 3, ὁ 'Αλκιβιάδης, =ὅπερ καὶ ἦν=, οὐδὲν\r\n  μᾶλλον ὀλιγαρχίας ἢ δημοκρατίας δεῖσθαι ἐδόκει αὐτῷ.\r\n\r\n  [202] Thucydides VIII. 47.\r\n\r\nThe part of Alcibiades in the revolution consisted only in giving it a\r\nstart by raising false expectations of a Persian alliance. His agents\r\nwent to Athens, and there Pisander, who took the leading part among\r\nthem, addressing the assembly of the citizens, urged that the only hope\r\nof salvation for Athens lay in an alliance with Persia, and declared\r\nthat that alliance would be made if they would invite Alcibiades to\r\nreturn, abolish their democracy, which was not to the liking of the\r\nking of Persia, and set up in its stead an oligarchy which the king\r\ncould trust[203]. The assembly was grieved at the prospect of losing\r\nits democratic constitution, but under the stress of circumstances\r\ngave some kind of provisional approval of the proposed change; for the\r\npresent however it took no definite step beyond appointing Pisander and\r\nten other men as envoys to negotiate with Alcibiades and Tissaphernes.\r\nPisander remained for a while in Athens for the purpose of visiting\r\nall the oligarchical clubs which already existed there and preparing\r\nthem to be ready to strike a blow against the democratic constitution:\r\nthis done, he departed on his mission[204]. It soon became evident\r\nthat Alcibiades was powerless to obtain help for Athens from the king\r\nof Persia or even from Tissaphernes: a breach occurred between him and\r\nthe oligarchical conspirators, and he took no further part in their\r\nproceedings[205].\r\n\r\n  [203] Thucydides VIII. 53.\r\n\r\n  [204] Thucydides VIII. 54.\r\n\r\n  [205] Thucydides VIII. 56.\r\n\r\nDuring the absence of Pisander the oligarchical clubs at Athens\r\nprepared the way for the success of his designs by skilfully\r\norganising a series of assassinations. The persons selected to\r\nbe murdered were the most faithful upholders of the democratic\r\nconstitution: the assassins were never brought to justice: and such\r\ngeneral terror prevailed that men did not dare to mourn for the\r\nvictims lest their own turn should come next[206]. Meanwhile the\r\nchief politicians in the oligarchic party, wishing to disguise their\r\nreal designs, gave out that the changes in the constitution which\r\nthey would advocate were moderate in character: they would limit the\r\nnumber of citizens who formed the ecclesia to a number not exceeding\r\nfive thousand, consisting of those who were best able to aid the\r\nstate by paying taxes or by serving in the war, and would propose\r\nthat henceforth wages from the treasury should be paid to none but\r\nthe soldiers and sailors: but in other respects they would wish the\r\nconstitution to remain unaltered[207].\r\n\r\n  [206] Thucydides VIII. 65, 66.\r\n\r\n  [207] Thucydides VIII. 65, the last sentence. My small addition to the\r\n  words of this sentence seems to be justified by ἐυπρεπὲς πρὸς τοὺς\r\n  πλείους which occurs in the next.\r\n\r\nPisander, on his return to Athens about April 411 B.C.[208], was\r\neager for the establishment of an oligarchy, with himself as one\r\nof its leading members: and, even if he had wished to pause in his\r\nmeasures, it was now dangerous for him to do so, because, if the\r\ncitizens recovered from their terror, he would be prosecuted under\r\na Graphê Paranomôn for the proposals which he had made and carried\r\nlast year, and would undergo severe punishment. One of his adherents\r\nnamed Pythodorus at once proposed to the assembly that it should\r\nappoint a small committee of citizens to make a draft scheme for a new\r\nconstitution: Cleitophon, who was probably an opponent of Pisander,\r\nmoved that it should be an instruction to the committee that they\r\nshould examine the ancient constitution of Cleisthenes to see whether\r\nany of its provisions ought to be revived. The proposal of Pythodorus\r\nwas carried: whether Cleitophon's instruction was accepted or rejected\r\nwe do not know[209].\r\n\r\n  [208] The oligarchical government lasted four months and ended two\r\n  months after new archons took office, that is to say, two months after\r\n  midsummer.

An\r\nassembly of the citizens was summoned to meet, not as usual at the\r\nPnyx within the city, but at the hill of Colonus, more than a mile\r\noutside the walls. At this assembly the proposals of the committee were\r\nannounced; and they were to the following effect. (1) Any Athenian\r\ncitizen may propose whatever he thinks fit; and no proposal shall make\r\nhim liable to a Graphê Paranomôn. (2) The government (that is to say,\r\nthe right of speaking and voting in the ecclesia) shall be entrusted,\r\nduring the continuance of the war, to a body of citizens numbering not\r\nless than Five Thousand, and consisting of those best qualified by\r\nbodily vigour for serving in the war or by wealth for contributing to\r\nthe public treasury. (3) During the continuance of the war no wages\r\nshall be paid from the treasury except to the army and navy, and the\r\nnine archons and the presidents of the assembly and council[210].\r\n\r\n  [210] Aristotle, _Constitution of Athens_, 29. Thucydides VIII. 67.\r\n\r\nThe proposals bore a specious aspect of moderation, and seemed to\r\npromise that the new constitution should be something like the old\r\nconstitution of Cleisthenes. The assembly gave its assent to these\r\nproposals: but, as soon as that assent had been given, it found\r\nthat further and more radical changes awaited it. A motion was made\r\nand carried that a second committee of a hundred citizens should be\r\nappointed to give more precise shape to the new constitution. The\r\nreport of this second committee, an elaborate document, disclosed the\r\nreal intentions of Pisander and his party. It set forth a complicated\r\nscheme of government which was to come into force at some future\r\ntime: but it also did what was more important by proposing that for\r\nthe present a council of Four Hundred should be elected, that the\r\nFour Hundred should appoint ten generals and a secretary to the\r\ngenerals, and that the eleven men thus appointed should have power to\r\ndo everything except alter the laws[211]. The proposals were ratified\r\nby the assembly; the council of Four Hundred, being elected during\r\nthe reign of terror which had been established, was no doubt entirely\r\nfilled with the adherents of Pisander, and the ten generals and their\r\nsecretary no doubt included Pisander himself and his most ardent\r\npartisans. No steps were taken to call the assembly of Five Thousand\r\ninto existence, and thus all political rights had been taken away from\r\nthe mass of the citizens, and unrestrained power was conferred upon\r\nPisander and his fellow-conspirators[212].\r\n\r\n  [211] Aristotle, _Constitution of Athens_, 31.\r\n\r\n  [212] Aristotle, _Constitution of Athens_, 31, 32.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of the oligarchy which had thus been founded are not\r\nnarrated in detail by our authorities: but we are told that the new\r\nrulers governed violently, and made many changes in the administration:\r\nthat they \"put to death some few men who seemed convenient to be got\r\nrid of, imprisoned others, and removed others from Attica[213],\" that\r\nthey fell to quarrelling with one another[214], and that at last they\r\nwere suspected of a design to introduce a garrison of Spartans into the\r\nPiræus, the port of Athens. As soon as this suspicion gained credence\r\nthe days of the oligarchy were numbered. A battalion of Athenian\r\nhoplites, employed by Pisander to build a fortress at the mouth of the\r\nPiræus for the reception of a Lacedæmonian garrison, rose in mutiny\r\nagainst their officers, held a meeting in Munychia, which adjoins the\r\nPiræus, to decide on their course of action, and after due deliberation\r\nmarched into Athens and piled arms at the foot of the Acropolis. Many\r\nspecious offers of ineffectual reforms were made to them by envoys\r\nfrom the Four Hundred: but they insisted on the one thing which the\r\noligarchy most dreaded, a free assembly of the citizens to be held\r\nwithin the city. The citizens met in assembly at the Pnyx, and their\r\nfirst resolution declared that the power of the Four Hundred was at an\r\nend[215].\r\n\r\n  [213] Thucydides VIII. 70.\r\n\r\n  [214] Thucydides VIII. 89.\r\n\r\n  [215] Thucydides VIII. 90-97.\r\n\r\nAfter the deposition of the Four Hundred, which occurred late in August\r\n411 B.C., the Athenians had to decide what their government should be.\r\nTwo courses lay open to them: they might rescind all the enactments\r\nwhich they had made four months earlier, and so return at once to an\r\nunmixed democracy: or they might allow those enactments, except such\r\nas were obviously mischievous, to remain in force. The second of the\r\ntwo alternatives was that which they adopted. They reaffirmed in\r\nsubstance the regulations which had been recommended by the small\r\ncommittee elected under the resolution of Pythodorus, and enacted: (1)\r\nThat the government should be entrusted to the body of not less than\r\nFive Thousand, which they had already ordered to be created. (2) That\r\nevery citizen, who furnished the equipment of a heavy armed soldier,\r\neither for himself or for any one else, should of right be a member of\r\nthis body. (3) That no citizen should receive pay for any political\r\nfunction, on pain of being solemnly accursed or excommunicated[216].\r\nThe constitution thus established was partly democratic and partly\r\noligarchical: it contained a preponderant element of democracy because\r\nit gave supreme power to a numerous body, who, though they were\r\ncalled the Five Thousand, were in reality about nine thousand[217]:\r\nbut it also contained some small oligarchical ingredients, since it\r\nexcluded the poorest citizens from the ecclesia, and by withholding\r\npayment for the discharge of political functions made it likely that\r\nfew citizens would be able to serve on the council of five hundred\r\nand in the popular law-courts except those who had money and leisure.\r\nConcerning the motives which induced the Athenians to adopt this mixed\r\nform of government we have no information, and can only observe that\r\nthe new constitution would certainly commend itself to the body of\r\nhoplites who had delivered the Athenians from their oppressors, since\r\nit gave supreme power to the class to which they belonged; and that,\r\nfrom what we know of the political opinions of Socrates[218], we may\r\nbe sure that it met with his hearty approval and was supported by his\r\npowerful advocacy. In regard to the merits of the new government we\r\nhave an emphatic testimony from Thucydides, who says that of all the\r\ngovernments that ruled Athens within the space of his lifetime this\r\nwas the best[219]. But the mixed form of government was not suited\r\nto the needs and the condition of the Athenians: for within a few\r\nyears--certainly before 406 B.C. when they condemned the commanders\r\nat Arginusæ, and possibly as early as 410 B.C.--they abandoned it and\r\nreverted to their well-tried system of unmixed democracy.\r\n\r\n  [216] Thucydides VIII. 97. 1. The meaning of the words is admirably\r\n  explained by Grote in a note to chapter LXII. of his _History of\r\n  Greece_.\r\n\r\n  [217] Arnold's Thucydides, note to VIII. 97. 1.\r\n\r\n  [218] Grote, _History of Greece_, octavo edition, vol. VI. p. 152,\r\n  cabinet edition, vol. VIII. p. 267.\r\n\r\n  [219] Thucydides V. 26.\r\n\r\nWithin seven years after the fall of the Four Hundred, Athens was\r\nagain ruled by an oligarchy. The events which led to the establishment\r\nof this second oligarchy were in one respect like those to which\r\nthe earlier oligarchy owed its origin, since they began with the\r\ndestruction of an Athenian fleet: but, as they were simpler and less\r\ncomplicated, they can be more briefly narrated.\r\n\r\nIn the year 405 B.C. the Athenians sent nearly the whole of their\r\nnaval force to oppose the Lacedæmonian fleet in the eastern waters of\r\nthe Ægean sea, along the coast of Asia Minor. In number of ships the\r\nAthenian and Lacedæmonian fleets were nearly equal: in all else they\r\nwere ill-matched antagonists. The Lacedæmonians were commanded by\r\nLysander, the ablest admiral ever produced by Sparta: the condition of\r\nthe Athenians was such as might be expected in the year immediately\r\nfollowing an undiscriminating execution of the commanders of the\r\nfleet. Among the six[220] admirals Conon alone was a man of ability,\r\ndiscipline was lax, and the operations were worse designed and worse\r\nexecuted than any others in the whole course of the war. Lysander took\r\nthe city of Lampsacus on the eastern shore of the narrow channel of\r\nthe Hellespont which divides Europe from Asia. The Athenian commanders\r\ntook station directly opposite on the western shore of the Hellespont,\r\nwhich at this point is only two miles wide, and there anchored their\r\nships close to the open beach of Ægospotami. The nearest place from\r\nwhich they could get supplies was Sestos, two miles distant: and\r\nall the commanders except Conon and the captain of the Paralus, the\r\ndespatch-boat, allowed their men to go ashore and wander far inland.\r\nLysander watched his opportunity, found the ships for the most part\r\ndeserted by their crews, and captured the whole of them (a hundred and\r\neighty in number), except the Paralus and a little squadron of eight\r\nships under the immediate command of Conon[221].\r\n\r\n [220] Xenophon, _Hellenica_ I. 7. § 1, and II. 1. § 16.\r\n\r\n [221] Xenophon, _Hellenica_ II. 1.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Ægospotami Athens could make no effectual\r\nresistance. Lysander blockaded the city by land and sea, and in\r\nthe spring of 404 B.C. the Athenians were compelled by starvation\r\nto capitulate and admit the Spartans. Lysander occupied the city,\r\ncompelled the Athenians to pull down at least a great part of the\r\nlong walls which defended Athens and Piræus, to readmit the members\r\nof the oligarchical party who had gone into exile, and to submit to\r\nbe governed by them[222]. Arbitrary power was assumed by a Board of\r\nThirty, who, being supported by Lysander, were able for eight months to\r\noppress their fellow citizens with violence and rapacity such as had\r\nnot been experienced in Athens even under the Four Hundred[223].\r\n\r\n  [222] Xenophon, _Hellenica_ II. 2.\r\n\r\n  [223] Xenophon, _Hellenica_ II. 3.\r\n\r\nThe governments both of the Four Hundred and of the Thirty were too\r\nshort-lived to furnish us with materials for forming any precise\r\nestimate of Greek oligarchy in general. They never went beyond the\r\nstage of being revolutionary or half-established governments: and,\r\nbeing in constant terror of destruction, they were obliged to resort\r\nto cruel measures which a settled oligarchy would not need. The mere\r\nfact that Greek oligarchies were often long-lived governments suffices\r\nto show that they were not, like the rule of the Four Hundred or the\r\nThirty, so sanguinary and oppressive as to provoke successful mutiny or\r\nrebellion: and we are entitled to believe that, as Athenian democracy\r\nwas the best of Greek democracies, so Athenian oligarchy was the worst\r\nof Greek oligarchies.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. _The conquest of the Greek cities by Macedonia._\r\n\r\nThe division of the Greek people into a large number of small\r\nindependent cities was a system which answered well enough as long as\r\nthe political horizon included no states other than Greek cities and\r\nAsiatic Empires. The Macedonians were a European people inhabiting\r\na large territory to the north of Greece, and united under a strong\r\nmilitary monarchy. They had formerly lived under a tribal monarchy of\r\nthe heroic type: in the fourth century B.C. they may be compared with\r\nthe Goths under Alaric or the Salian Franks under Clovis. They were\r\ndevoted to military pursuits: they had some of the spirit of individual\r\nindependence which is usually found in a rude people of warriors, and\r\nthey showed it even under Alexander the Great, the strongest of all\r\ntheir kings[224]: but their king was their commander, and in time of\r\nwar, so long as he commanded ably, he enjoyed supreme power. To resist\r\nsuch a people as the Macedonians the Greeks would have had to do the\r\nimpossible: to unlearn in a moment all the maxims of jealous precaution\r\nagainst rival cities by which they had regulated their conduct, to give\r\nup the practice of politics in miniature and understand at once what\r\nwas needed in politics on a larger scale. As it was, the old jealousy\r\nbetween Athens and Sparta continued to be as active as ever, only one\r\nor two Greek states joined in resistance to the invader, and after the\r\nbattle of Chæroneia in 338 B.C. Greece lay at the mercy of Philip king\r\nof Macedonia.\r\n\r\n  [224] Especially on the famous occasion when Alexander did not dare to\r\n  put his general Philotas to death till he had been condemned by the\r\n  assembled chieftains and warriors. Grote, part II. chapter XCIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nARISTOTLE'S CLASSIFICATION OF POLITIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have now described, in a roughly chronological order, the different\r\nkinds of government which successively appeared in the Greek states\r\nfrom their infancy to their overthrow by Macedonia. I proceed to give\r\nclearer ideas both of the principles on which those governments were\r\nconstructed and of the full meaning of certain terms employed in the\r\nforegoing descriptions of them, by stating the classification of\r\npolities which Aristotle gives us in his treatise on Politics. The time\r\nat which this work was written cannot be precisely determined, but part\r\nof it was certainly composed after, and other parts probably before,\r\nthe battle of Chæroneia[225].\r\n\r\n  [225] The latest event referred to in the treatise is the murder of\r\n  king Philip in 336 B.C. Aristotle died in 322 B.C.\r\n\r\nAristotle observed all the governments that he knew, and as the\r\nresult of his observation divided polities (that is to say, forms of\r\ngovernment, or principles on which governments were constructed or\r\nmight be constructed) into two classes, the right or normal polities in\r\nwhich government was carried on for the good of the whole community,\r\nand the perverted or abnormal polities in which it was conducted by the\r\ngovernors for their own private interest. Further, since he observed\r\nthat in all the polities power was lodged in the hands either of one\r\nperson, or of a few, or of the citizens in general, he subdivided each\r\nof his two classes into three species according as power belonged to\r\none person, or to few, or to many. Among the normal polities the first\r\nspecies was characterized by the rule of one man for the good of all,\r\nand was known as βασιλεία or kingship: in the second the few best men\r\nruled for the good of all, and it was known as ἀριστοκρατία or the rule\r\nof the best: the third, where a large number of citizens ruled for the\r\ngood of all, deserved in a special and honourable sense the name of\r\nπολιτεία (Polity, or the rule of πολῖται--a Commonwealth), which was\r\nmore loosely applied to all constitutions. Among the perverted polities\r\nthe first species was tyranny, or the rule of one man for his private\r\ninterest; the second oligarchy, or the selfish rule of the few (who in\r\npractice were always identical with the rich); and the third democracy,\r\nthe rule of the many (or rather of the poor, since the poor are always\r\nthe most numerous) for the selfish interest of their class[226].\r\n\r\n  [226] The classification is set forth in the _Politics_ III. 6, 7.\r\n  Welldon, pp. 116-120. In III. 6. 1 Aristotle defines a polity as \"an\r\n  ordering or arrangement of a state in respect of its offices generally\r\n  and especially of the supreme office.\"\r\n\r\nThe character of the several species of polity is better understood\r\nfrom the observation of concrete instances than from mere definition.\r\n\r\n(1) Kingship, the rule of one for the good of all, is best exemplified\r\nin the monarchies of the heroic age of Greece, in which the kings ruled\r\nover willing subjects, came to the throne by inheritance and not by\r\nviolence, and governed within the limits imposed by custom[227]. Other\r\ninstances of kingship occurred in the early history of Lacedæmonia,\r\nin Macedonia, and among the Molossians: for in all these cases the\r\nkings owed their power to the gratitude of their subjects for good\r\nservices which they had rendered in founding the state or in acquiring\r\nnew territory[228]. Even the Persian monarchy of Cyrus and Darius,\r\nalthough despotic, was an example of kingship and belonged to the\r\nnormal polities: for the power of the king was controlled by custom\r\nand acquired not by violence but by inheritance, and its despotic\r\nnature was merely an accident due to the slavish character of the\r\nAsiatics[229]. Beside the heroic monarchies of the Greeks we may set\r\nthe governments of such kings as Cerdic of Wessex, Ethelbert of Kent,\r\nEdwin of Northumbria, and Alfred the Great: with the conquering kings\r\nof Macedonia we may compare Alaric the Visigoth or Clovis the Frank:\r\nand for the monarchy of the Persians we may find a parallel in the\r\nOttoman sultanate of the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\n  [227] Aristotle, _Politics_ III. 14. 2. Welldon, transl. p. 146.\r\n\r\n  [228] Aristotle, _Politics_ V. 10. 8. Welldon, p. 382.\r\n\r\n  [229] Aristotle, _Politics_ III. 14. 6. Welldon, p. 145.\r\n\r\n(2) Aristocracy is constituted on the principle that power belongs\r\nto those few best men who are best qualified to use it for the good\r\nof the community[230]. The principle that power is based upon merit\r\nbelongs to the best kind of monarchy, as we have just seen, and the\r\nonly difference between aristocracy and this best kingship is that\r\naristocracy gives the power to more than one and kingship to one only.\r\n\r\n  [230] Aristotle, _Politics_ V. 10. 7. Bekker. Welldon, transl. p. 382.\r\n  \"Kingship corresponds in principle to aristocracy as it is based upon\r\n  merit.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no instance in Greek history of an aristocracy pure and\r\nsimple. The most aristocratic governments in Greece were those of the\r\ntribes in the heroic age and the government of Sparta before 500 B.C.:\r\nbut all these were instances of aristocracy combined with kingship.\r\nThe elders who formed the Spartan council were selected for merit and\r\nthe councils were aristocratic: but the kingly power was important as\r\nwell as the power of the council, and the Spartan government is to be\r\nclassed as a monarchy with a large element of aristocracy.\r\n\r\nThe principle that power and merit should go together was very\r\nsparingly applied in the other Greek states, and the usual method\r\nof appointing to offices was by drawing lots among the candidates:\r\nexceptional instances of the use of voting in elections are found at\r\nAthens in the cases of the archons for a few years after 508 B.C.[231],\r\nand of the ten generals throughout the period of the democracy.\r\n\r\n  [231] See p. 76.\r\n\r\nThe constitution of Rome in the third century B.C. and especially\r\nafter the battle of Cannæ, when magistrates were selected for merit\r\nwithout regard to their patrician or plebeian order, and the senate,\r\nthe supreme power in the government, was filled entirely with men who\r\nhad served as magistrates or been named senators for high character\r\nand ability, is an example of almost unmixed aristocracy. The small\r\nnon-aristocratic elements in that constitution were democratic or\r\noligarchic.\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked that it is according to Aristotle an aristocratic\r\nfeature in a government if officers are appointed by election and not\r\nby lot, because if officers are elected power and merit tend to go\r\ntogether[232]. Hence it may be regarded as an aristocratic feature in\r\nmodern states that members of Parliament are elected, provided they are\r\nelected for merit: if they are elected for their willingness to give\r\npledges, they are no longer elected for merit, and they will use their\r\npower not for the good of all but to comply with the wishes of their\r\nconstituents, and the real rulers will be the constituents.\r\n\r\n  [232] Aristotle, _Politics_ II. 11. 7, II. 12. 2. Welldon, pp. 91, 94.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of the Premier and the Cabinet must be made according\r\nto merit and is aristocratic. The English method of selecting officers\r\nfor the army and for the civil service by competitive examination is in\r\nprinciple aristocratic, being adopted because merit is shown by success\r\nin examination.\r\n\r\n(3) Of Polity, the rule of many for the good of all, there are many\r\nspecies. Aristotle describes some of them in general terms, but does\r\nnot name a definite example of any.\r\n\r\nThe first species was a form of government adopted by some Greek\r\npeoples after the fall of the heroic monarchies. In that age\r\ndistinctions of class depended on military efficiency, and military\r\nefficiency on wealth. The only effective warriors were those who fought\r\non horseback or from a chariot (we do not know whether chariots were\r\nstill used in fighting, and Aristotle's words are ambiguous): those men\r\nwho possessed horses, whether they served in war themselves or placed\r\ntheir horses at the disposal of other warriors, helped to furnish the\r\neffective part of the army; and, because they rendered this service\r\nto the community, they became the ruling class. In the Polity thus\r\nconstituted the ruling class was not a large one, though larger than\r\nthe ruling class in a mere oligarchy: and this species of Polity,\r\nthough it was not oligarchy, had a somewhat oligarchical character.\r\nThe second species of Polity was constructed on much the same lines as\r\nthe first, but in a later age, when the effective warriors included not\r\nonly the horsemen but also a much larger force of heavy armed infantry\r\nor hoplites. In this case, as in the other, military efficiency was\r\ndependent on property: the panoply, or complete suit of armour and set\r\nof weapons which a hoplite required, had to be skilfully wrought, and\r\nwas a possession beyond the means of the poor, though it cost far less\r\nthan the breeding and keep of a horse. The ruling class included every\r\nman who furnished, either for his own use or for use by another, either\r\na war-horse or the equipment of a hoplite: and the ruling class was so\r\nlarge that the Polities of the second species were known in the times\r\nwhen they existed, though not in Aristotle's time, as democracies[233].\r\nThere were also many other varieties of Polities. In all of them,\r\npolitical power was shared by a class or classes which included a large\r\npart of the free men, and therefore the classes that were neither very\r\nrich nor very poor were of great political importance. The importance\r\nof the upper and middle classes might be secured by various methods: by\r\nconceding political rights only to those who had a certain amount of\r\nproperty, the amount being so fixed that those who had political rights\r\nwere slightly more numerous than those who had them not; by giving\r\npolitical rights to all free men but compelling those who had property\r\nto be regular, under pain of a fine, in attendance at the assembly; or\r\nby other like devices.\r\n\r\n  [233] Aristotle, IV. 13. 10, 11. Bekker. Welldon, pages 291, 292.\r\n\r\nThe one feature common to all Polities was that they were made by a\r\nfusion of oligarchy and democracy. They were in one way democratic\r\nbecause they conceded political rights to a large body of free men: but\r\nin another sense they had a trace of oligarchy in their composition,\r\nbecause they gave more power to a man with property than to one who was\r\nvery poor[234].\r\n\r\n  [234] The account here given of Polity is derived from Aristotle's\r\n  discussion of it in the _Politics_, book IV. chapters 8-13 (in\r\n  Bekker's edition): Welldon, pages 274-292. Nothing has been added\r\n  except a few necessary explanations.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said it is clear that the second species of Polity\r\nis well exemplified in the system of government which existed in most\r\nof the German tribes in the time of Cæsar or Tacitus: a system in\r\nwhich the assembly of the warriors, including both horsemen and foot\r\nsoldiers, determined the action of the community. The name Polity may\r\nalso be applied to the government established at Athens by Solon, in\r\nwhich the power granted to the common people was only just so much as\r\nto prevent them from being disaffected[235]: and to the constitution\r\nof Cleisthenes, in which the assembly of the citizens was supreme,\r\nbut did not hold its meetings very frequently, and showed no undue\r\nfavour toward the poorer citizens. And, finally, all modern governments\r\nwith popular representative institutions, though they differ from\r\nAristotle's Polity in many important features, yet have more in common\r\nwith that kind of government than with any other that Aristotle\r\nrecognises.\r\n\r\n  [235] Aristotle, _Politics_ II. 12. 5. Welldon, p. 95.\r\n\r\n(4) We turn to the three perverted forms of government. Democracy, the\r\nrule of the many (or rather of the poor, since the poor are always the\r\nmost numerous) for the selfish interest of their own class, will be\r\nconsidered first, because it is the least strongly contrasted with the\r\nright polities which have been already examined. The word democracy,\r\nas has been noticed above, did not always denote an extreme democracy,\r\nfor there was a time when it was applied to those moderate governments\r\nwhich Aristotle calls Polities: and Aristotle himself is not perfectly\r\nconstant in his use of the word, since there is a passage[236] in\r\nwhich he makes it comprehend both moderate and extreme popular rule.\r\nThe democracy however which we now have to consider is the extreme or\r\nthoroughgoing democracy.\r\n\r\n  [236] _Politics_, IV. 6. 1-4. Welldon, pages 269, 270.\r\n\r\nFrom many passages in the Politics we learn what Aristotle regarded as\r\nthe distinctive features and tendencies of complete democracy.\r\n\r\nDemocracy was a form of government which arose in cities with a large\r\npopulation and a large revenue: the whole of the citizens not only\r\nwere theoretically admitted to a share in the work of governing, but\r\nactively and habitually exercised their powers, and those citizens\r\nwho could not otherwise afford the time to attend assemblies were\r\nenabled to do so by receiving remuneration out of the state treasury.\r\nAnd indeed such a population had more leisure than any other for\r\nattendance at the assemblies and for serving on juries: for, as their\r\nprivate property was small, their time was not used up in attending\r\nto the management of it. The consequence was that under this form of\r\ngovernment the ultimate authority in the state was not any established\r\nconstitution but the mass of the poor citizens[237].\r\n\r\n  [237] Aristotle, _Politics_, Bekker IV. 6. 5, 6. Welldon, pages 270,\r\n  271.\r\n\r\nAgain in another striking passage Aristotle says that there are\r\ndemocracies in which the ultimate authority is not the established\r\nconstitution but the mass of the people and the resolutions which\r\nthe people chooses to make.... In these democracies the common folk\r\nbecomes a monarch, a monarch composed of many men, a multitude reigning\r\ncollectively.... The common folk, being a monarch, determines to rule\r\nas a monarch owing no obedience to the constitution, so that, becoming\r\na despot, it esteems most highly those men who flatter it the most: and\r\nthis kind of democracy holds the same place among popular governments\r\nas tyranny among kingly governments. The same temper and character\r\nis found in this democracy as in tyranny: both of them are arbitrary\r\nrulers of the better citizens, only the one rules by resolutions, the\r\nother by decrees, and the one is influenced by demagogues, the other by\r\npersonal adulators[238].\r\n\r\n  [238] Aristotle, _Politics_, Bekker IV. 4. 25-28. Welldon, pp.\r\n  265-267. In translating, I have taken liberties with the words but I\r\n  hope not with the sense of any sentence.\r\n\r\nIn yet other passages we are told that democratically governed cities\r\nare beyond all others anxious to ensure equality among their citizens,\r\nand that the use of ostracism for the expulsion of any man, who from\r\nwealth or personal popularity or from any other cause has unusual\r\npolitical influence, is a result of this anxiety[239]: and when we\r\nfind that the practice of appointing to offices by drawing lots is\r\ndemocratic[240], we may observe (though Aristotle does not say so) that\r\nthis also is a striking exemplification of the same guiding principle.\r\nWhen we read that the principle of democracy is freedom[241] we must,\r\nconsidering the tenor of two passages which have been already quoted,\r\nunderstand that the freedom that is meant is not the freedom of the\r\nindividual but the freedom of the assembly to do whatever it pleases.\r\n\r\n  [239] Aristotle, _Politics_ III. 13. 15. Welldon, pages 140, 141.\r\n\r\n  [240] Aristotle, _Politics_ II. 11. 5-8. Welldon, pages 90, 91.\r\n\r\n  [241] _Ibid._ IV. 4. 23, IV. 8. 7. Bekker. Welldon, pages 265, 275.\r\n\r\nThe marks then of a pure democracy as conceived by Aristotle are these:\r\n(1) All the citizens, and more especially the poor citizens, actively\r\nand habitually control the business of government, and come together\r\nin frequent general assemblies for that purpose: (2) The assembly of\r\ncitizens is free to do whatever it pleases, not being bound to conform\r\nto any law, precedent, or established constitution: (3) Every citizen\r\nhas, as far as the nature of things permits, an equal share with every\r\nother citizen of political power and the enjoyment of office.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that Aristotle regarded the Athenian constitution as an\r\nexample of the genuine or extreme species of democracy, since that\r\nconstitution cannot be brought under any of the other species which he\r\ndefines: moreover he says explicitly that it is only in the extreme\r\nform of democracy that demagogues are to be found[242], and we know\r\nfrom history that demagogues were plentiful and powerful at Athens.\r\nBut much of what he says about extreme democracy cannot be taken as\r\nreferring to Athenian democracy: at any rate it does not accurately\r\ndepict the democracy under which the Athenians lived. In support\r\nof these statements, I may adduce two facts. Firstly, the Athenian\r\nassembly was not in practice free to do whatever it liked, and was not\r\nabove the law and the constitution. It could indeed decide in favour\r\nof an unconstitutional measure whenever it chose, and its decision\r\nwas carried into effect: but the proposer of the measure acted at his\r\nperil. In case the people after accepting his proposal continued for\r\na whole year to think it good and useful, he was safe: but if within\r\nthe year his measure became unpopular, he was certain to be condemned\r\nunder a Graphê Paranomôn, and to suffer heavy penalties. And secondly,\r\nthe passage, in which Aristotle denounces extreme democracy for turning\r\nthe common folk into an arbitrary ruler who defies law and precedent\r\nand oppresses the wealthier citizens, can only refer to cases in which\r\nthe poorer classes take pleasure in reckless changes and in robbery of\r\nthe rich: at Athens the assembly, though the poor citizens predominated\r\nin it, disliked changes and was considerate towards the wealthy\r\ncitizens[243].\r\n\r\n  [242] Aristotle, _Politics_ IV. 4. 24-26, Bekker. Welldon, pages 265,\r\n  266.\r\n\r\n  [243] For example, till 340 B.C., the richest citizens were allowed to\r\n  contribute far less than their just share towards the trierarchies,\r\n  which defrayed a large part of the cost of maintaining the navy; and\r\n  the change to a fairer system was effected with difficulty: Grote,\r\n  Part II. chapter XC.\r\n\r\n  The strong conservative tendency, which prevailed among the Athenians\r\n  under their democratic constitution, was, I believe, first noticed by\r\n  Mr W. Warde Fowler. There is a striking passage on the matter in his\r\n  _City-state of the Greeks and Romans_ (pages 170, 171).\r\n\r\nThe mischiefs which Aristotle regarded as attendant on democracies\r\nhave certainly been found in some governments which have borne that\r\nname. Aristotle could not have denounced them as he does unless he had\r\nseen them exemplified in some Greek democracies: in the governments\r\n(nominally at least democratic), which ruled in Paris during the\r\nFrench Revolution, all and more than all the evils that he describes\r\nwere to be found. Athens was practically exempt from them, and we may\r\nseek causes for its immunity. One cause, the long training that the\r\nAthenians went through under the constitution of Cleisthenes, has\r\nbeen already noticed: the other was that at Athens the principles\r\non which Greek democracy was founded were actually followed out in\r\nthe daily life of the community, the citizens gave their time and\r\nattention to the work of government, and the people was far more truly\r\na self-governing people than any other that has ever existed.\r\n\r\nFrom what has just been said it will be seen that I regard Athens as\r\nthe sole historical example of a true democracy in the Greek sense of\r\nthe term. The Florentine Republic after 1324 A.D. is often compared\r\nwith the Athenian democracy: but, out of the three characteristics of\r\nGreek democracy, the Florentine constitution had only the two least\r\nimportant: the citizens had indeed, as far as possible, equal shares\r\nin the enjoyment of office, and the assembly was free to do as it\r\nliked: but the assembly was rarely convoked, and the true governors\r\nwere not the assembled citizens, but some fifty citizens selected\r\nby drawing lots every two months or every four months to fill the\r\nvarious magistracies and boards which ruled the city[244]. In modern\r\nSwitzerland some faint traces of actual self-government by the citizens\r\ncan be detected in the yearly assemblies held in four of the smaller\r\ncantons, and in the cantonal and federal Referenda, or popular votes on\r\nnew laws: but they are no more than traces, and do not make the Swiss\r\ngovernment at all like the Athenian: and, beside this, Switzerland is\r\na federal state while Athens was a city, and for that reason the two\r\nstates are so unlike that it is useless to compare them.\r\n\r\n  [244] Hallam, _Middle Ages_, chapter III.: in the cabinet edition,\r\n  vol. I. pages 421-423.\r\n\r\n(5) Oligarchy, or the rule of the few rich for the advantage of their\r\nown class, admits of several degrees and varieties. There is something\r\nof oligarchy wherever the enjoyment of public office is limited to\r\nthose who have a certain amount of property: there is a larger element\r\nof oligarchy if the qualifying amount is fixed extremely high, or if\r\nthe body of rulers fill up vacancies in their own number, or if offices\r\ndescend from father to son: and the state is completely oligarchic if,\r\nbesides all this, the law does not control the rulers but the rulers\r\ncontrol the law[245]. We may detect a minute trace of oligarchy in\r\nSolon's constitution which excluded the poorest citizens from the\r\narchonship. Perfect oligarchies are exemplified in the Bacchiadæ of\r\nCorinth whose power was hereditary and set them above the law, so that\r\nthey could order Labda's child to be killed, and in the Eupatridæ or\r\nhereditary nobles of Athens, whose oppressive rule necessitated Solon's\r\nreforms. Other instances of oligarchy are found in the exclusive\r\nrule of the patricians at Rome from 510 B.C. to 367 B.C., and in the\r\nmonopoly of office which was enjoyed by the wealthiest class of the\r\nRomans between 150 B.C. and the time of Julius Cæsar. The most complete\r\nexample of an oligarchy is found at Venice between 1310 and the fall of\r\nthe republic in 1797.\r\n\r\n  [245] Aristotle, _Politics_. Bekker IV. 5. 1-2 and IV. 6. 7-11.\r\n  Welldon, pages 266-267, pages 271-272.\r\n\r\n(6) Tyranny, the rule of one man for his private interest, has been\r\nexemplified in the stories of the despots of Corinth and Athens. For\r\nother instances we must go to the great storehouse of illustrations of\r\ntyranny, the mediæval history of Italy where, besides the well known\r\ndespots Eccelin da Romano, the Visconti, the Medici, and Cesar Borgia,\r\nthere is such a host of minor tyrants that pages might be filled with a\r\nmere enumeration of their names.\r\n\r\nWe are now in a position to make some general remarks on Aristotle's\r\nclassification of polities--to see in some measure what it was, and\r\nwhat it was not.\r\n\r\nAristotle defined a polity as \"an ordering or arrangement of a state\r\nin respect of its offices generally and especially of the supreme\r\noffice[246]\": and from this definition, as well as from his use of\r\nthe word πολιτεία, it is clear that he regarded a polity as the form\r\non which a whole government and not merely a part of a government\r\nwas constructed. But nevertheless he recognised that a government\r\nconsisting wholly of kingship or wholly of aristocracy was, at least\r\namong the Greeks, merely an ideal or perhaps an imaginary government,\r\nand was not within the range of practical politics[247]. And herein\r\nGreek history shows that he was right: for we never find in it a whole\r\ngovernment composed solely of kingship or wholly of aristocracy. On the\r\nother hand we find that not only kingship and aristocracy, but also\r\noligarchy and democracy, constantly occur as forms or principles on\r\nwhich a part of a government was constructed: for example the ancient\r\nSpartan constitution was in one part kingly, in another aristocratic,\r\nin another democratic; Solon's constitution contained elements both\r\nof democracy and of oligarchy; and even the mature Athenian democracy\r\ncontained a trace of aristocracy in the selection of the ten generals\r\nfor merit and not by chance. Hence it is clear that, while kingship,\r\naristocracy, polity, democracy, oligarchy and tyranny were polities,\r\nand each of them was a form on which a whole government either real or\r\nideal could be erected, four of them at least, kingship, aristocracy,\r\ndemocracy and oligarchy, were also forms on which a part of a\r\ngovernment could be constructed, and which entered in very various\r\ncombinations into the making of actual governments.\r\n\r\n  [246] _Politics_ III. 6. 1. Welldon, p. 116.\r\n\r\n  [247] In the _Politics_ (IV. 2. Bekker. Welldon, pp. 253, 254)\r\n  Aristotle says that \"speculation about the ideally best polity is\r\n  nothing else than a discussion of kingship and aristocracy\": and\r\n  that \"kingship must be a mere name and not a reality, unless it\r\n  is justified by a vast superiority of the reigning king over his\r\n  subjects\":--a condition that can rarely if ever be fulfilled. See also\r\n  Sidgwick, _Elements of Politics_, p. 579.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said it will be seen that Aristotle's classification\r\nof polities was based much more on philosophic theory than on history\r\nand that, in some part at least of its extent, it is not a direct\r\nclassification of actual and concrete governments.\r\n\r\nThe only actual governments which it directly and straightforwardly\r\nclassifies are those which were constructed wholly on the lines of\r\nany single one of the six polities, and these were tyrannies, pure\r\noligarchies and Polities. As to the rest of the governments which\r\nAristotle knew, it enabled him to describe them admirably, but did\r\nnot help him to assign to them brief, distinctive and convenient\r\nclass-names: for instance, it enabled him to describe the Spartan\r\ngovernment as containing elements of kingship, of aristocracy and of\r\ndemocracy, and the constitution of the Phœnician city of Carthage as\r\ncontaining elements of kingship, aristocracy, oligarchy and democracy;\r\nbut it did not furnish him with any class-name for either of those\r\ngovernments other than the single word normal or the descriptions of\r\nthem which have just been mentioned[248].\r\n\r\n  [248] The descriptions of the Spartan and the Carthaginian governments\r\n  are given in the _Politics_ II. 9 and II. 11.\r\n\r\nIt has been necessary for me in speaking of the Greek governments to\r\nemploy some class-names, and the names that I have used are tribal\r\ngovernments and city governments. The mere fact of using these names\r\nimplied an assumption that the governments of the Greek tribes and\r\nthe governments of the Greek cities formed in some way two distinct\r\nclasses. With the aid of the Aristotelian polities and our historical\r\nexamination of Greek governments we may now make some observations\r\nwhich will help us to see whether the assumption was justified by facts.\r\n\r\nFirstly, it may be noticed that all governments of Greek tribes were\r\nmixed governments containing within them in combination both the rule\r\nof the one and the rule of the few, or both the rule of the few and\r\nthe rule of the many: and all governments of Greek city states were\r\npure or unmixed governments, that is to say pure oligarchy, or pure\r\ntyranny, or pure democracy (in so far as a pure democracy is in the\r\nnature of things possible). In making this general statement about\r\nthe governments of city states I do not regard Argolis from the time\r\nof Pheidon to 480 B.C., and Athens in the days of Cleisthenes as city\r\nstates in the strictest sense of the term: for in Argolis the central\r\ncity of Argos was by no means the sole place of importance, but was\r\ncounterbalanced by the two ancient cities of Tiryns and Mycenæ, and\r\nin Attica in the time of Cleisthenes the rural districts were in some\r\nrespects as important as the city of Athens.\r\n\r\nSecondly, all the governments of the tribes were limited and\r\nconstitutional, and all the governments of the city states with\r\none possible exception, were absolute or unconstitutional. These\r\npropositions might almost be regarded as corollaries to those which\r\npreceded them, since in a mixed government the various elements impose\r\nlimitations on the authority of one another, and ensure that each\r\nof them shall be subject to a constitution or general understanding\r\nabout the exercise of power, while in an unmixed government the ruling\r\nperson or class is likely to be subject to no restrictions: but it is\r\nmore satisfactory to establish their truth from history. A moment's\r\nconsideration shows that the mixed governments which prevailed in the\r\ntribes of the heroic age and at ancient Sparta, as well as those in\r\nwhich the military class were the ruling class, were all limited and\r\nconstitutional. The unmixed governments of the cities were oligarchies,\r\nor tyrannies, or democracies. It is obvious that oligarchies and\r\ntyrannies were absolute governments, and in a democracy Aristotle\r\ntells us that the ruling class, the whole body of citizens, was above\r\nthe law. The one possible exception occurs in the fully developed\r\nAthenian democracy, which was in many respects exceptional among Greek\r\ndemocracies. It is by no means clear that at Athens the mass of the\r\ncitizens was an absolute ruler. The truth seems to be that it was an\r\nabsolute ruler in so far that there were no limitations that it could\r\nnot throw off at pleasure, but in practice it was very much like a\r\nconstitutional ruler because it voluntarily submitted to formalities\r\nwhich restrained its actions.\r\n\r\nThirdly, in the tribes, government was conducted for the good of the\r\nwhole community; in the city states, except perhaps Athens, it was\r\nconducted for the good of the rulers. After all that has been said,\r\nthese propositions require no further proving.\r\n\r\nWe find then that in the tribes governments were mixed, constitutional\r\nand, in Aristotle's sense, normal; in the city states they were\r\nunmixed, and with one possible exception they were absolute and, in\r\nAristotle's sense, abnormal or perverted.\r\n\r\nNow that we have discovered from observation of numerous instances that\r\nthe governments of the Greek tribes and the governments of the Greek\r\ncities stood in strong contrast with one another, we may try to find\r\nout the causes to which the contrast was due.\r\n\r\nIn the case of tribes it is impossible to make out completely why their\r\ngovernments were mixed, constitutional, and normal, because we know but\r\nlittle about the tribes and nothing of their history. But at any rate\r\nwe may observe that the tribes were militant communities engaged in a\r\nconstant struggle for existence with other similar communities, and\r\nthat in such communities it is essential to the safety of each and all\r\nof their members that all the classes which contribute to the fighting\r\nstrength should be kept contented and zealous in the common cause, and\r\nthat therefore it is necessary that none of those classes should be\r\noppressed and that each should have its fair share in determining their\r\ncommon action.\r\n\r\nIn the case of city states the reasons why the governments were\r\nunmixed, absolute, and abnormal are best seen contrasting a city state\r\nwith a larger political community: for example, England in the middle\r\nages. In that large political community it was impossible, owing to the\r\nsize of the territory, the importance of the country districts, and\r\nthe diverse characters of different districts, for any single person\r\nor class to engross all power and become the sole ruler. The size of\r\nthe territory necessitated the existence of local rulers or magnates,\r\nthe barons: and diversities of local character made each locality\r\ninclined in case of need to act for itself under its own baron. The\r\nresult was that if any person or class attempted to become omnipotent\r\nand oppressive, some of the local districts rose in revolt under their\r\nbarons and the attempt ended in failure. In a city state all the\r\ncircumstances were different: the country districts had no strength or\r\nimportance, the power, whether it was a person or a class, that ruled\r\nin the city, met with no resistance from outside the city, and, owing\r\nto the small size of the territory, had all its enemies within its\r\nreach, and could easily destroy them unless they chose to go into exile.\r\n\r\nIn my second chapter it was stated tentatively and without proof that\r\nthere is an intimate connexion between the form of a political body and\r\nthe form of the government by which it is ruled. The connexion between\r\nform of political body and form of government has now been traced in\r\nthe case of the Greek tribes and cities, and it has been shown that the\r\nassumption which I made when I divided the Greek governments before the\r\nbattle of Chæroneia into tribal governments and city governments was\r\none for which history affords justification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE ACHÆAN LEAGUE[249].\r\n\r\n  [249] The chief modern authorities for the history of the Achæan\r\n  League are Bishop Thirlwall in the eighth volume of his _History of\r\n  Greece_, and Professor Freeman in his _History of Federal Government\r\n  in Greece and Italy_. I have compiled this chapter, after reading what\r\n  those authors say on the subject, from the books by ancient writers\r\n  which they cite.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Achæan peoples of the heroic age, when they were driven by the\r\ninvading Dorians from Sparta, Messenia, Argos and Corinth, took refuge\r\nin the northern part of the Peloponnesus and there founded the Achæan\r\npeople of the historical period. The district in which they settled\r\nmeasures only about sixty-five English miles from east to west along\r\nthe coast of the Corinthian gulf, and from twelve to twenty miles\r\nfrom north to south. It is cut off from the rest of the Peloponnesus\r\nby a range of lofty mountains which cannot in any part be crossed\r\nwithout difficulty. From this mountain range many ridges run northward,\r\ndividing the country into narrow valleys[250]. The past history of the\r\nAchæans and the character of their territory made them well suited\r\nfor a federal form of government; that is to say, for having a single\r\ngovernment for some purposes and many governments for other purposes.\r\nThey were impelled towards union by their common Achæan race, by common\r\nexperience of conquest by the Dorians, and by the certainty that, if an\r\nindependent state were formed in each little valley, none of them would\r\nbe large enough to be of any importance in Greece: but at the same\r\ntime some sort of separate government in each valley was natural in a\r\ncountry where communications were so much interrupted by mountains. It\r\nis said that they lived for a time under a single government only--the\r\nkingly government of the descendants of their hero Orestes: but at some\r\nvery early period each of the valleys must have acquired some sort\r\nof independence, since, on the abolition of the kingly government,\r\nat a time too early to be known to history, the separate cantons or\r\ncities acted for themselves and voluntarily joined together in a\r\nconfederation, adopting at the same time institutions of a popular\r\ncharacter. They acquired such a reputation for just government and good\r\nfaith in their dealings that after the battle of Leuctra in 371 B.C.\r\nthey were singled out from all the Greek states to act as arbitrators,\r\non some points which were disputed, between the victorious Thebans\r\nand the defeated Spartans: and Polybius believed they had acted in\r\nthe same capacity at a much earlier date in the affairs of Croton\r\nand Sybaris, two states which had been founded in southern Italy by\r\ncolonists from Achaia[251]. For centuries they lived on, somewhat\r\nisolated from the rest of Greece and little noticed by Greek writers,\r\nbut maintaining their union and their system of government. Even in the\r\ndays of Philip of Macedonia and his son Alexander the Great they were\r\nleft unmolested: but, after Alexander's death, some of the ambitious\r\nprinces who contended for power in Greece and Macedonia contrived\r\nto sow discord among their cities: they were consequently unable to\r\ndefend themselves, and some of the cities were occupied by Macedonian\r\ngarrisons, while others were put under the rule of tyrants. The gradual\r\ndestruction of the league which was thus brought about must, from what\r\nPolybius says, have begun at some time after 315 B.C. when Cassander\r\ncame to the throne of Macedonia, and have been completed in thirty\r\nyears from that date. The earlier part of the mischief was done by\r\nCassander and Demetrius Poliorcetes, the rest by Antigonus Gonatas son\r\nof Demetrius[252].\r\n\r\n  [250] Smith's _Dictionary of Geography_, article Achaia: and Smith's\r\n  _Atlas of Ancient Geography_.\r\n\r\n  [251] For the early history of Achaia see Polybius II. 37-41:\r\n  Shuckburgh, translation, pages 134-137. The story about Croton and\r\n  Sybaris may be incorrect (Grote, Part II. end of chapter XXXVII.): but\r\n  it shows that Polybius believed the good government of the Achæans had\r\n  been established long before the battle of Leuctra.\r\n\r\n  [252] Polybius II. 41.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 283 B.C. it chanced that the attention of Antigonus\r\nwas called away from the affairs of Greece; and the Achæans, being\r\nthus delivered from his interference, before long began to restore\r\ntheir federal union. At first, about 280 B.C., the renewed league\r\nconsisted of only four of the cities: then it was joined by three\r\nmore, and probably before long it included all the rest:--the whole\r\nnumber being now reduced to ten, for four had ceased to exist, and\r\nonly two new ones had grown up[253]. For about thirty years the league\r\ndid not include any cities outside Achaia: but in 251 B.C. Aratus of\r\nSicyon, when only twenty years of age, rescued his native city out of\r\nthe power of its tyrant by surprising the garrison, and, in order to\r\nprovide for its future safety, induced his fellow-citizens to enrol\r\ntheir state as a member of the confederation. In the year 245 B.C.\r\nhe was elected to the office of strategus or chief magistrate of the\r\nleague: and that office he held, as a general rule, thenceforward in\r\nalternate years till his death thirty-two years later. He was most\r\nactive and skilful in bringing cities into the league. In his second\r\nterm of office he surprised and overpowered the Macedonian garrison\r\nwhich held Acrocorinthus, and thus set Corinth free. The liberated\r\nCorinthians were glad to join the Achæans, and the league, gaining\r\npossession of the Corinthian citadel which commanded the Isthmus, was\r\nable thenceforth to protect not only its own cities but the whole of\r\nthe Peloponnesus against any enemy that came by land[254]. After this\r\nmany other cities gave in their adhesion: the most important of those\r\nthat joined before 227 B.C. were Megara, Trœzen, Epidaurus, Cleonæ,\r\nMantineia, Phlius, Megalopolis, and Argos[255].\r\n\r\n  [253] Polybius II. 41. For the names of the cities see also Mr\r\n  Shuckburgh's Introduction, pp. xlviii, xlix.\r\n\r\n  [254] Polybius II. 43.\r\n\r\n  [255] For a list of the cities in the league see Freeman, _Federal\r\n  Government_, pp. 713-714.\r\n\r\nThe league, throughout the period of its reconstitution in Achaia and\r\nits extension outside (that is to say from 280 B.C. to 227 B.C.), was\r\nmost successful in protecting a number of Greek states from Macedonian\r\ninterference. But it was never joined by Sparta nor by several other\r\nPeloponnesian cities: and about the year 227 B.C. Cleomenes III., one\r\nof the two kings of Sparta, wishing at whatever cost to regain for\r\nthe Spartans their old predominance in the Peloponnesus, found that\r\nthe Achæan league was an obstacle to his designs: and, having first\r\nmade an alliance with the Ætolians, who might have put impediments\r\nin his way, he became engaged in a war with the Achæans, and, in the\r\ncourse of it, defeated them in three important battles. Aratus and his\r\ncountrymen in their distress thought it necessary to ask the aid of\r\nAntigonus Dôsôn, who was regent in Macedonia as guardian of his nephew\r\nthe young king: Antigonus readily granted their request, but required\r\nthem in return to allow him to place a Macedonian garrison in the\r\nAcrocorinthus. He entered the Peloponnesus, and, in 222 or 221 B.C.\r\nat Sellasia in the north-east corner of the Lacedæmonian territory,\r\nthe allied armies of Macedonia and Achaia won a great victory and\r\ndestroyed the power of Cleomenes[256]: but the Achæans found that,\r\nby re-admitting the Macedonian power to the Peloponnesus, they had\r\nforfeited their independence in regard to foreign policy, and must\r\nconform to the wishes of their too powerful ally. The league continued\r\nto exist \"for another period of seventy-five years, retaining its\r\ninternal constitution, vastly increased in territorial extent, but,\r\nin external affairs, with only a few short intervals, reduced almost\r\nto the condition of a dependent ally, first of Macedonia and then of\r\nRome[257].\" From the year 146 B.C. Achaia and Macedonia were both\r\nincluded in the dominions of the Roman republic.\r\n\r\n  [256] Polybius II. 45-53 and 64-69.\r\n\r\n  [257] Freeman, _Federal Government_, p. 498.\r\n\r\nWe have now to examine the structure and constitution of the league\r\nof cities or cantons[258], which, though it eventually succumbed to\r\nMacedonia, had in happier days been distinguished for sixty years of\r\nsuccessful assertion of its independence. We will observe first the\r\nrelation of each component state to the central government, and then\r\nproceed to inquire into the nature of the central government itself.\r\n\r\n  [258] Most of the communities in Achaia and some of those in Arcadia\r\n  were rather cantons than cities: Plutarch (_Aratus_, ch. 9) calls the\r\n  Achæans μικροπολῖται, citizens of petty towns. Corinth, Argos and\r\n  Megalopolis were great cities.\r\n\r\nThe component states were left free to manage their own internal\r\naffairs, each holding its own assemblies, electing its own magistrates,\r\nand making its own laws on all matters except the few that were\r\nreserved to be settled by the central government[259]. It is probable\r\nthat they might even choose their own constitutions: but practically\r\na state under a tyranny or a close oligarchy or even a strong kingly\r\npower like that of Cleomenes at Sparta, was excluded from membership\r\nin the league because it could not allow its citizens to take part\r\nin the general assemblies which I shall have to describe in speaking\r\nof the central government. In course of time all the cities adopted\r\nconstitutions of a popular but moderate character, and in the second\r\ncentury B.C., when the league included the whole Peloponnesus, Polybius\r\nsays that all the states employed the same laws, weights, measures,\r\nand coinage, and were all alike in their administrative, deliberative\r\nand judicial authorities, so that the whole peninsula differed from a\r\nsingle city only in not having all its inhabitants enclosed within a\r\nsingle wall[260].\r\n\r\n  [259] The component states were called πόλεις, and this fact alone, in\r\n  the absence of indications tending the other way, is enough to show\r\n  that they managed their internal affairs. For further evidence see\r\n  Freeman, _Federal Government_, p. 256.\r\n\r\n  [260] Polybius II. 37.\r\n\r\nThe central government consisted of two deliberative bodies, the\r\nassembly and the council, and of an executive officer, the strategus,\r\nwith several subordinates: its business comprised the conduct of all\r\nforeign affairs, and the management of the armed forces.\r\n\r\nThe assembly or synod was attended by all citizens of any city in the\r\nleague who chose to present themselves[261]: its business was to\r\nsettle questions of foreign policy and to elect the executive officers\r\nof the league. The regular place of meeting was Ægium, a small city on\r\nthe Corinthian gulf, and it seems that the assembly always met there\r\ntill 218 B.C.: afterwards it sometimes came together at other cities in\r\nthe territory of the league[262]. There were ordinary meetings every\r\nspring and every autumn[263]: and special meetings could at any time be\r\nsummoned by the magistrates to settle important and urgent questions\r\nof foreign policy, the duration of any special meeting being limited\r\nto three days[264]. The votes on questions of policy were taken not by\r\nheads but by states: that is to say, each state had one vote, and its\r\nvote was given Aye or No, according as the majority of those of its\r\ncitizens who were present inclined to the one side or the other[265].\r\n\r\n  [261] Polybius (II. 38) emphatically calls the Achæan system a\r\n  democracy with free and equal speech.\r\n\r\n  [262] Polybius (V. 1) says that in 218 B.C. the assembly met _in\r\n  accordance with the law_ at Ægium: but king Philip afterwards\r\n  persuaded the magistrates to transfer it to Sicyon. The important\r\n  assembly which made the alliance with Rome in 198 B.C. was also held\r\n  at Sicyon: Livy XXXII. 19.\r\n\r\n  [263] For example, in 224 B.C. Antigonus Dôsôn presented himself at an\r\n  assembly at Ægium in the spring and at another at the same place in\r\n  the autumn (Polybius II. 54). The meeting in the spring had to elect\r\n  the officers for the coming year: and the strategus entered on his\r\n  duties in May, at the rising of the Pleiades (Polybius V. 1).\r\n\r\n  [264] Livy (XXXII. 22) after recording the proceedings of two days in\r\n  the special meeting of 198 B.C. says \"Only one day was left in which\r\n  the meeting could act: for the law ordered that on the third day its\r\n  decision should be made.\"\r\n\r\n  [265] Livy (XXXII. 22) says that in 198 B.C. when the magistrates were\r\n  just going to take a vote, most of the _states_ openly showed which\r\n  way they would vote (omnibus fere populis ... præ se ferentibus quid\r\n  decreturi essent): then the citizens of Dymê and Megalopolis and some\r\n  from the Argolid left the assembly: but (XXXII. 23) the rest of the\r\n  _states_ of the league, when asked in turn how they voted (ceteri\r\n  populi Achæorum, cum sententias perrogarentur), decided in a certain\r\n  way.\r\n\r\nOf the council almost nothing is known: its meetings were held not only\r\nat the times of the federal assemblies, but at other times also: for\r\nin the year 220 B.C. king Philip had an interview with the council at\r\nÆgium about a question of foreign policy, which he would certainly have\r\nlaid before the assembly if it had been possible[266]. The number of\r\nmembers in the council must have been at least a hundred and twenty,\r\nand may have been larger[267]. From the little evidence that we have\r\nwe may perhaps gather that the council sat for a good part of the\r\nyear, and acted as a committee of the assembly to prepare the business\r\nthat had to be laid before it: and, at times when the assembly was\r\nnot sitting, decided any questions that were not so important as to\r\nnecessitate a special meeting of the assembly.\r\n\r\n  [266] Polybius IV. 26 προσελθοντος τοῦ βασιλέως πρὸς τὴν βουλὴν ἐν\r\n  Αἰγίῳ. The business related to a question of war against the Ætolians.\r\n\r\n  [267] The evidence for this is referred to by Bishop Thirlwall\r\n  (_History of Greece_, vol. VIII. p. 92). In 187 B.C. Eumenes king of\r\n  Pergamum offered to give 120 talents, on condition that the money\r\n  was invested and the interest used to pay the councillors (see\r\n  Polybius XXIII. 7 in Dindorf's edition: XXII. 10 in Mr Shuckburgh's\r\n  translation). The yearly interest of a talent would be about 720\r\n  drachmæ:--a large salary for a councillor. The councillors at Athens\r\n  were paid about 300 drachmæ yearly, see above, p. 51, note 1.\r\n\r\nThe executive officers were the strategus, and ten demiurgi or\r\nministers:--together with a hypo-strategus or under-general and perhaps\r\na secretary of state[268]. The strategus was elected each year in the\r\nspring meeting of the assembly and entered on his duties a short time\r\nafter his election. His office was in its origin military, and he was\r\nby right commander in the field and controller of the armed forces: but\r\nhis most important functions were to act as leader in the assembly--to\r\nexpound his foreign policy and obtain authority to carry it out--and\r\nto manage negotiations with foreign powers: this last part of his work\r\nwas of such moment that the symbol of his office was a seal[269]. It\r\nis shown by the case of Aratus that the Achæans were more anxious that\r\ntheir strategus should be a good foreign minister than that he should\r\nbe a good commander-in-chief: for though Aratus was a very poor general\r\nand lost many battles, his countrymen set such a value on his skill\r\nin dealing with foreign affairs that they elected him over and over\r\nagain--not indeed in successive years, for the constitution forbade\r\nit--but as often as the law allowed.\r\n\r\n  [268] Polybius V. 94 ὐποστράτηγος. Strabo VIII. 7. 3 γραμματεύς: but\r\n  this passage proves the existence of the office of secretary only for\r\n  the very early days of the re-constituted league soon after 280 B.C.\r\n\r\n  [269] Freeman, _Federal Government_, p. 299, from Polybius IV. 7.\r\n\r\nThe ten demiurgi were also elected by the assembly[270]. They acted\r\ncollectively as presiding officers in the assembly and determined what\r\nquestions should be put to the vote[271]: but they also acted as a\r\ncabinet or council of ministers to the strategus; for on one occasion a\r\ndespatch was addressed by Flamininus the Roman general to the strategus\r\nand the demiurgi, and the reply to it was written in the name of the\r\nsame authorities[272].\r\n\r\n  [270] Livy XXXII. 22 Magistratus (damiurgos vocant: decem numero\r\n  creantur). The words _magistratus_ and _creantur_ indicate that they\r\n  were elected.\r\n\r\n  [271] Livy XXXII. 22.\r\n\r\n  [272] Polybius XXIV. 5 in Bekker's and Dindorf's editions: XXIII. 5 in\r\n  Mr Shuckburgh's translation.\r\n\r\nThe federal government of the league, which has just been described, is\r\ncalled by Polybius a democracy: but it was not a democracy according\r\nto the definition which Aristotle gave in stating his classification\r\nof polities; for he defined democracy as the rule of the many for the\r\ninterest of the poor[273]. In the Achæan league it can hardly be said\r\nthat the many were the rulers: for, though no citizen was excluded\r\nby law from the assembly, the attendance was in practice limited to\r\nthose who had time and money to spend in travelling to the place of\r\nmeeting, and to those few who chanced to reside there. Moreover the\r\nmeetings were held so seldom and lasted for so short a time that the\r\nassembly could not control the government in regard to details, and,\r\nthough of course it had the supreme power in great questions and in\r\nthe last resort, it practically left nearly everything in the hands\r\nof the strategus. Finally the policy of the league was conducted in\r\nthe interest not of any governing class or governing person but of the\r\ncommunity at large.\r\n\r\n  [273] Aristotle himself, as we have seen, in one passage uses the term\r\n  democracy to denote any government in which a large number of citizens\r\n  take part: but in doing so he departs from his original definition of\r\n  it.\r\n\r\nA Polity or Commonwealth was originally defined by Aristotle as the\r\nrule of the mass of the citizens for the advantage of the whole\r\ncommunity: and he afterwards described it as a mixture of oligarchy and\r\ndemocracy. Hence it is clear that, on the lines of his classification,\r\nthe Achæan league was a Polity. The supreme power in it belonged in\r\none sense to the whole of the citizens, because no citizen was legally\r\nexcluded from the assembly, and thus the constitution had one of the\r\ncharacteristics of democracy: but in another sense power belonged\r\nto those only of the citizens who possessed a fair income and could\r\nactually attend the meetings, and in this respect the constitution\r\nwas oligarchic. Moreover, though oligarchy and democracy when unmixed\r\nboth belong to the perverted polities, because their governments rule\r\nselfishly, the mixture of them in the Achæan league produced a normal\r\npolity, viz., a Polity or Commonwealth, whose governors ruled for the\r\ngood of the whole people. But these were not the only elements in the\r\nconstitution: the aristocratic principle was conspicuously present,\r\nand was seen in the great power and commanding influence which Aratus\r\npossessed in consequence of his high qualifications as a ruler and\r\nadviser.\r\n\r\nThe federal system of government combined many advantages. It enabled\r\nthe Greeks to continue to live as members of small self-governing\r\ncommunities--a way of living to which the physical features of their\r\ncountry naturally led them, and to which they were deeply attached:\r\nit gave them, through their union, much greater security than they\r\ncould have enjoyed without it: and it formed a large part of them into\r\na community that more resembled a nation than anything else that had\r\nyet arisen in Greece. The system was tried not only by the Achæans but\r\nalso by several other divisions of the Hellenic race: by the Phocians,\r\nthe Acarnanians, the Epirots, the Arcadians, and the Ætolians[274]:\r\nand among the Ætolians and Acarnanians it attained such a measure of\r\nsuccess that in the later period of the Macedonian supremacy these two\r\npeoples were, after the Achæans, the most important of the Hellenic\r\npowers.\r\n\r\n  [274] See Professor Freeman's _History of Federal Government_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n Transcriber's Notes\r\n\r\n Obvious typographical errors have been silently corrected.\r\n\r\n Variations in hyphenation have been standardised, but other variations\r\n in spelling, accents and punctuation are as in the original.\r\n\r\n Italics are represented thus _italic_ and gesperrt thus =gesperrt=.\r\n\r\n The \"ERRATUM.\r\n Page 14, line 21, _for_ empires _read_ empire.\"\r\n has been implemented.",
