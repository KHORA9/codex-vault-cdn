We now find it necessary to provide by great\r\nadditional buildings for the business of the Government. This growth\r\nin the need for the housing of the Government is but a proof and\r\nexample of the way in which the nation has grown and the sphere of\r\naction of the National Government has grown. We now administer the\r\naffairs of a nation in which the extraordinary growth of population\r\nhas been outstripped by the growth of wealth and the growth in complex\r\ninterests. The material problems that face us to-day are not such as\r\nthey were in Washington’s time, but the underlying facts of human\r\nnature are the same now as they were then. Under altered external\r\nform we war with the same tendencies toward evil that were evident in\r\nWashington’s time, and are helped by the same tendencies for good. It\r\nis about some of these that I wish to say a word to-day.\r\n\r\nIn Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress you may recall the description of the\r\nMan with the Muck-rake, the man who could look no way but downward,\r\nwith the muck-rake in his hand; who was offered a celestial crown for\r\nhis muck-rake, but who would neither look up nor regard the crown he\r\nwas offered, but continued to rake to himself the filth of the floor.\r\n\r\nIn Pilgrim’s Progress the Man with the Muck-rake is set forth as the\r\nexample of him whose vision is fixed on carnal instead of on spiritual\r\nthings. Yet he also typifies the man who in this life consistently\r\nrefuses to see aught that is lofty, and fixes his eyes with solemn\r\nintentness only on that which is vile and debasing. Now, it is very\r\nnecessary that we should not flinch from seeing what is vile and\r\ndebasing. There is filth on the floor, and it must be scraped up with\r\nthe muck-rake; and there are times and places where this service is the\r\nmost needed of all the services that can be performed. But the man who\r\nnever does anything else, who never thinks or speaks or writes, save of\r\nhis feats with the muck-rake, speedily becomes, not a help to society,\r\nnot an incitement to good, but one of the most potent forces for evil.\r\n\r\nThere are, in the body politic, economic and social, many and grave\r\nevils, and there is urgent necessity for the sternest war upon them.\r\nThere should be relentless exposure of and attack upon every evil\r\nman, whether politician or business man, every evil practice, whether\r\nin politics, in business, or in social life. I hail as a benefactor\r\nevery writer or speaker, every man who, on the platform, or in book,\r\nmagazine, or newspaper, with merciless severity makes such attack,\r\nprovided always that he in his turn remembers that the attack is of\r\nuse only if it is absolutely truthful. The liar is no whit better than\r\nthe thief, and if his mendacity takes the form of slander, he may be\r\nworse than most thieves. It puts a premium upon knavery untruthfully\r\nto attack an honest man, or even with hysterical exaggeration to\r\nassail a bad man with untruth. An epidemic of indiscriminate assault\r\nupon character does not good, but very great harm. The soul of every\r\nscoundrel is gladdened whenever an honest man is assailed, or even\r\nwhen a scoundrel is untruthfully assailed.\r\n\r\nNow, it is easy to twist out of shape what I have just said, easy to\r\naffect to misunderstand it, and, if it is slurred over in repetition,\r\nnot difficult really to misunderstand it. Some persons are sincerely\r\nincapable of understanding that to denounce mud slinging does not mean\r\nthe indorsement of whitewashing; and both the interested individuals\r\nwho need whitewashing, and those others who practice mud slinging,\r\nlike to encourage such confusion of ideas. One of the chief counts\r\nagainst those who make indiscriminate assault upon men in business or\r\nmen in public life, is that they invite a reaction which is sure to\r\ntell powerfully in favor of the unscrupulous scoundrel who really ought\r\nto be attacked, who ought to be exposed, who ought, if possible, to\r\nbe put in the penitentiary. If Aristides is praised overmuch as just,\r\npeople get tired of hearing it; and overcensure of the unjust finally\r\nand from similar reasons results in their favor.\r\n\r\nAny excess is almost sure to invite a reaction; and, unfortunately, the\r\nreaction, instead of taking the form of punishment of those guilty of\r\nthe excess, is very apt to take the form either of punishment of the\r\nunoffending or of giving immunity, and even strength, to offenders. The\r\neffort to make financial or political profit out of the destruction\r\nof character can only result in public calamity. Gross and reckless\r\nassaults on character, whether on the stump or in newspaper, magazine,\r\nor book, create a morbid and vicious public sentiment, and at the same\r\ntime act as a profound deterrent to able men of normal sensitiveness\r\nand tend to prevent them from entering the public service at any price.\r\nAs an instance in point, I may mention that one serious difficulty\r\nencountered in getting the right type of men to dig the Panama Canal is\r\nthe certainty that they will be exposed, both without, and, I am sorry\r\nto say, sometimes within, Congress, to utterly reckless assaults on\r\ntheir character and capacity.\r\n\r\nAt the risk of repetition let me say again that my plea is, not for\r\nimmunity to but for the most unsparing exposure of the politician who\r\nbetrays his trust, of the big business men who makes or spends his\r\nfortune in illegitimate or corrupt ways. There should be a resolute\r\neffort to hunt every such man out of the position he has disgraced.\r\nExpose the crime, and hunt down the criminal; but remember that even\r\nin the case of crime, if it is attacked in sensational, lurid, and\r\nuntruthful fashion, the attack may do more damage to the public mind\r\nthan the crime itself. It is because I feel that there should be no\r\nrest in the endless war against the forces of evil that I ask that the\r\nwar be conducted with sanity as well as with resolution. The men with\r\nthe muck-rakes are often indispensable to the well-being of society;\r\nbut only if they know when to stop raking the muck, and to look upward\r\nto the celestial crown above them, to the crown of worthy endeavor.\r\nThere are beautiful things above and round about them; and if they\r\ngradually grow to feel that the whole world is nothing but muck, their\r\npower of usefulness is gone. If the whole picture is painted black\r\nthere remains no hue whereby to single out the rascals for distinction\r\nfrom their fellows. Such painting finally induces a kind of moral\r\ncolor-blindness; and people affected by it come to the conclusion that\r\nno man is really black, and no man really white, but they are all gray.\r\nIn other words, they neither believe in the truth of the attack, nor\r\nin the honesty of the man who is attacked; they grow as suspicious of\r\nthe accusation as of the offense; it becomes well-nigh hopeless to stir\r\nthem either to wrath against wrongdoing or to enthusiasm for what is\r\nright; and such a mental attitude in the public gives hope to every\r\nknave, and is the despair of honest men.\r\n\r\nTo assail the great and admitted evils of our political and industrial\r\nlife with such crude and sweeping generalizations as to include decent\r\nmen in the general condemnation means the searing of the public\r\nconscience. There results a general attitude either of cynical belief\r\nin and indifference to public corruption or else of a distrustful\r\ninability to discriminate between the good and the bad. Either attitude\r\nis fraught with untold damage to the country as a whole. The fool who\r\nhas not sense to discriminate between what is good and what is bad is\r\nwell-nigh as dangerous as the man who does discriminate and yet chooses\r\nthe bad. There is nothing more distressing to every good patriot, to\r\nevery good American, than the hard, scoffing spirit which treats the\r\nallegation of dishonesty in a public man as a cause for laughter.\r\nSuch laughter is worse than the crackling of thorns under a pot, for\r\nit denotes not merely the vacant mind, but the heart in which high\r\nemotions have been choked before they could grow to fruition.\r\n\r\nThere is any amount of good in the world, and there never was a time\r\nwhen loftier and more disinterested work for the betterment of mankind\r\nwas being done than now. The forces that tend for evil are great and\r\nterrible, but the forces of truth and love and courage and honesty\r\nand generosity and sympathy are also stronger than ever before. It\r\nis a foolish and timid, no less than a wicked thing, to blink the\r\nfact that the forces of evil are strong, but it is even worse to fail\r\nto take into account the strength of the forces that tell for good.\r\nHysterical sensationalism is the very poorest weapon wherewith to fight\r\nfor lasting righteousness. The men who with stern sobriety and truth\r\nassail the many evils of our time, whether in the public press, or in\r\nmagazines, or in books, are the leaders and allies of all engaged in\r\nthe work for social and political betterment. But if they give good\r\nreason for distrust of what they say, if they chill the ardor of those\r\nwho demand truth as a primary virtue, they thereby betray the good\r\ncause, and play into the hands of the very men against whom they are\r\nnominally at war.\r\n\r\nIn his Ecclesiastical Polity that fine old Elizabethan divine, Bishop\r\nHooker, wrote:\r\n\r\n    “He that goeth about to persuade a multitude that they are\r\n    not so well governed as they ought to be, shall never want\r\n    attentive and favorable hearers; because they know the manifold\r\n    defects whereunto every kind of regimen is subject, but the\r\n    secret lets and difficulties, which in public proceedings\r\n    are innumerable and inevitable, they have not ordinarily the\r\n    judgment to consider.”\r\n\r\nThis truth should be kept constantly in mind by every free people\r\ndesiring to preserve the sanity and poise indispensable to the\r\npermanent success of self-government. Yet, on the other hand, it\r\nis vital not to permit this spirit of sanity and self-command\r\nto degenerate into mere mental stagnation. Bad though a state of\r\nhysterical excitement is, and evil though the results are which come\r\nfrom the violent oscillations such excitement invariably produces,\r\nyet a sodden acquiescence in evil is even worse. At this moment we\r\nare passing through a period of great unrest――social, political, and\r\nindustrial unrest. It is of the utmost importance for our future\r\nthat this should prove to be not the unrest of mere rebelliousness\r\nagainst life, of mere dissatisfaction with the inevitable inequality\r\nof conditions, but the unrest of a resolute and eager ambition to\r\nsecure the betterment of the individual and the nation. So far as this\r\nmovement of agitation throughout the country takes the form of a fierce\r\ndiscontent with evil, of a determination to punish the authors of evil,\r\nwhether in industry or politics, the feeling is to be heartily welcomed\r\nas a sign of healthy life.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, it turns into a mere crusade of appetite\r\nagainst appetite, of a contest between the brutal greed of the\r\n“have-nots” and the brutal greed of the “haves,” then it has no\r\nsignificance for good, but only for evil. If it seeks to establish a\r\nline of cleavage, not along the line which divides good men from bad,\r\nbut along that other line, running at right angles thereto, which\r\ndivides those who are well off from those who are less well off, then\r\nit will be fraught with immeasurable harm to the body politic.\r\n\r\nWe can no more and no less afford to condone evil in the man of capital\r\nthan evil in the man of no capital. The wealthy man who exults because\r\nthere is a failure of justice in the effort to bring some trust magnate\r\nto an account for his misdeeds is as bad as, and no worse than, the\r\nso-called labor leader who clamorously strives to excite a foul class\r\nfeeling on behalf of some other labor leader who is implicated in\r\nmurder. One attitude is as bad as the other, and no worse; in each case\r\nthe accused is entitled to exact justice; and in neither case is there\r\nneed of action by others which can be construed into an expression of\r\nsympathy for crime.\r\n\r\nIt is a prime necessity that if the present unrest is to result in\r\npermanent good the emotion shall be translated into action, and that\r\nthe action shall be marked by honesty, sanity, and self-restraint.\r\nThere is mighty little good in a mere spasm of reform. The reform that\r\ncounts is that which comes through steady, continuous growth; violent\r\nemotionalism leads to exhaustion.\r\n\r\nIt is important to this people to grapple with the problems connected\r\nwith the amassing of enormous fortunes, and the use of those fortunes,\r\nboth corporate and individual, in business. We should discriminate\r\nin the sharpest way between fortunes well-won and fortunes ill-won;\r\nbetween those gained as an incident to performing great services to the\r\ncommunity as a whole, and those gained in evil fashion by keeping just\r\nwithin the limits of mere law-honesty. Of course no amount of charity\r\nin spending such fortunes in any way compensates for misconduct in\r\nmaking them. As a matter of personal conviction, and without pretending\r\nto discuss the details or formulate the system, I feel that we shall\r\nultimately have to consider the adoption of some such scheme as that\r\nof a progressive tax on all fortunes, beyond a certain amount, either\r\ngiven in life or devised or bequeathed upon death to any individual――a\r\ntax so framed as to put it out of the power of the owner of one of\r\nthese enormous fortunes to hand on more than a certain amount to any\r\none individual; the tax, of course, to be imposed by the National and\r\nnot the State government. Such taxation should, of course, be aimed\r\nmerely at the inheritance or transmission in their entirety of those\r\nfortunes swollen beyond all healthy limits.\r\n\r\nAgain, the National Government must in some form exercise supervision\r\nover corporations engaged in interstate business――and all large\r\ncorporations are engaged in interstate business――whether by license\r\nor otherwise, so as to permit us to deal with the far-reaching evils\r\nof over-capitalization. This year we are making a beginning in the\r\ndirection of serious effort to settle some of these economic problems\r\nby the railway-rate legislation. Such legislation, if so framed, as\r\nI am sure it will be, as to secure definite and tangible results,\r\nwill amount to something of itself; and it will amount to a great deal\r\nmore in so far as it is taken as a first step in the direction of a\r\npolicy of superintendence and control over corporate wealth engaged\r\nin interstate commerce, this superintendence and control not to be\r\nexercised in a spirit of malevolence toward the men who have created\r\nthe wealth, but with the firm purpose both to do justice to them and to\r\nsee that they in their turn do justice to the public at large.\r\n\r\nThe first requisite in the public servants who are to deal in this\r\nshape with corporations, whether as legislators or as executives, is\r\nhonesty. This honesty can be no respecter of persons. There can be no\r\nsuch thing as unilateral honesty. The danger is not really from corrupt\r\ncorporations; it springs from the corruption itself, whether exercised\r\nfor or against corporations.\r\n\r\nThe eighth commandment reads, “Thou shalt not steal.” It does not read,\r\n“Thou shalt not steal from the rich man.” It does not read, “Thou\r\nshalt not steal from the poor man.” It reads simply and plainly, “Thou\r\nshalt not steal.” No good whatever will come from that warped and mock\r\nmorality which denounces the misdeeds of men of wealth and forgets\r\nthe misdeeds practiced at their expense; which denounces bribery, but\r\nblinds itself to blackmail; which foams with rage if a corporation\r\nsecures favors by improper methods, and merely leers with hideous mirth\r\nif the corporation is itself wronged. The only public servant who can\r\nbe trusted honestly to protect the rights of the public against the\r\nmisdeed of a corporation is that public man who will just as surely\r\nprotect the corporation itself from wrongful aggression. If a public\r\nman is willing to yield to popular clamor and do wrong to the men of\r\nwealth or to rich corporations, it may be set down as certain that if\r\nthe opportunity comes he will secretly and furtively do wrong to the\r\npublic in the interest of a corporation.\r\n\r\nBut, in addition to honesty, we need sanity. No honesty will make\r\na public man useful if that man is timid or foolish, if he is a\r\nhot-headed zealot or an impracticable visionary. As we strive for\r\nreform we find that it is not at all merely the case of a long uphill\r\npull. On the contrary, there is almost as much of breeching work as\r\nof collar work; to depend only on traces means that there will soon\r\nbe a runaway and an upset. The men of wealth who to-day are trying to\r\nprevent the regulation and control of their business in the interest of\r\nthe public by the proper Government authorities will not succeed, in\r\nmy judgment, in checking the progress of the movement. But if they did\r\nsucceed they would find that they had sown the wind and would surely\r\nreap the whirlwind, for they would ultimately provoke the violent\r\nexcesses which accompany a reform coming by convulsion instead of by\r\nsteady and natural growth.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the wild preachers of unrest and discontent,\r\nthe wild agitators against the entire existing order, the men who\r\nact crookedly, whether because of sinister design or from mere\r\npuzzle-headedness, the men who preach destruction without proposing\r\nany substitute for what they intend to destroy, or who propose a\r\nsubstitute which would be far worse than the existing evils――all these\r\nmen are the most dangerous opponents of real reform. If they get their\r\nway they will lead the people into a deeper pit than any into which\r\nthey could fall under the present system. If they fail to get their way\r\nthey will still do incalculable harm by provoking the kind of reaction,\r\nwhich in its revolt against the senseless evil of their teaching, would\r\nenthrone more securely than ever the very evils which their misguided\r\nfollowers believe they are attacking.\r\n\r\nMore important than aught else is the development of the broadest\r\nsympathy of man for man. The welfare of the wage-worker, the welfare\r\nof the tiller of the soil, upon these depend the welfare of the entire\r\ncountry; their good is not to be sought in pulling down others; but\r\ntheir good must be the prime object of all our statesmanship.\r\n\r\nMaterially we must strive to secure a broader economic opportunity\r\nfor all men, so that each shall have a better chance to show the stuff\r\nof which he is made. Spiritually and ethically we must strive to bring\r\nabout clean living and right thinking. We appreciate that the things of\r\nthe body are important; but we appreciate also that the things of the\r\nsoul are immeasurably more important. The foundation stone of national\r\nlife is, and ever must be, the high individual character of the average\r\ncitizen.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *",
