Boyle argues that just as every\r\ninformed citizen needs to know at least something about the\r\nenvironment or civil rights, every citizen should also\r\nunderstand intellectual property law. Why? Because intellectual\r\nproperty rights mark out the ground rules of the information\r\nsociety, and today's policies are unbalanced, unsupported by\r\nevidence, and often detrimental to cultural access, free speech,\r\ndigital creativity, and scientific innovation.\r\n\r\nBoyle identifies as a major problem the widespread failure to\r\nunderstand the importance of the public domain--the realm of\r\nmaterial that everyone is free to use and share without\r\npermission or fee. The public domain is as vital to innovation\r\nand culture as the realm of material protected by intellectual\r\nproperty rights, he asserts, and he calls for a movement akin to\r\nthe environmental movement to preserve it. With a clear analysis\r\nof issues ranging from Jefferson's philosophy of innovation to\r\nmusical sampling, synthetic biology and Internet file sharing,\r\nthis timely book brings a positive new perspective to important\r\ncultural and legal debates. If we continue to enclose the\r\n\"commons of the mind,\" Boyle argues, we will all be the poorer.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor James Boyle's website: www.thepublicdomain.org\r\n\r\nJames Boyle is William Neal Reynolds Professor of Law and co-\r\nfounder of the Center for the Study of the Public Domain Duke\r\nLaw School.  He joined the faculty in July 2000.  He has also\r\ntaught at American University, Yale, Harvard, and the University\r\nof Pennsylvania Law School.  He is the author of Shamans,\r\nSoftware and Spleens: Law and Construction of the Information\r\nSociety and The Shakespeare Chronicles, a novel about the search\r\nfor the true author of Shakespeare's works.

In 2003 he won the World Technology\r\nAward for Law  for his work on the \"intellectual ecology\" of the\r\npublic domain, and on the new \"enclosure movement\" that\r\nthreatens it; (a disappointing amount of which was foretold in\r\nhis 1996 New York Times article on the subject.)  Professor\r\nBoyle has written on legal and social theory, on issues ranging\r\nfrom political correctness to constitutional interpretation and\r\nfrom the social contract to the authorship debate in law and\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nFor the last ten years, his work has focused on intellectual\r\nproperty.  His essays include The Second Enclosure Movement, a\r\nstudy of the economic rhetoric of price discrimination in\r\ndigital commerce, and a Manifesto on WIPO. His shorter pieces\r\ninclude Missing the Point on Microsoft, a speech to the\r\nFederalist Society called Conservatives and Intellectual\r\nProperty, and numerous newspaper articles on law, technology\r\nand culture. His book reviews on social theory and the\r\nenvironment, the naturalistic fallacy in environmentalism, and\r\non  competing approaches to copyright have appeared in the Times\r\nLiterary Supplement. He currently writes as an online columnist\r\nfor the Financial Times' New Economy Policy Forum.

For one of my\r\nstudents it was United States Patent number 6,004,596 for a\r\n\"Sealed Crustless Sandwich.\" In the curiously mangled form of\r\nEnglish that patent law produces, it was described this way:\r\n2\r\n\r\n    A sealed crustless sandwich for providing a convenient\r\nsandwich without an outer crust which can be stored for long\r\nperiods of time without a central filling from leaking\r\noutwardly. The sandwich includes a lower bread portion, an upper\r\nbread portion, an upper filling and a lower filling between the\r\nlower and upper bread portions, a center filling sealed between\r\nthe upper and lower fillings, and a crimped edge along an outer\r\nperimeter of the bread portions for sealing the fillings there\r\nbetween. The upper and lower fillings are preferably comprised\r\nof peanut butter and the center filling is comprised of at least\r\njelly. The center filling is prevented from radiating outwardly\r\ninto and through the bread portions from the surrounding peanut\r\nbutter.1\r\n3\r\n\r\n\"But why does this upset you?\" I asked; \"you've seen much worse\r\nthan this.\" And he had. There are patents on human genes, on\r\nauctions, on algorithms.2 The U.S. Olympic Committee has an\r\nexpansive right akin to a trademark over the word \"Olympic\" and\r\nwill not permit gay activists to hold a \"Gay Olympic Games.\" The\r\nSupreme Court sees no First Amendment problem with this.3\r\nMargaret Mitchell's estate famously tried to use copyright to\r\nprevent Gone With the Wind from being told from a slave's point\r\nof view.4 The copyright over the words you are now reading will\r\nnot expire until seventy years after my death; the men die young\r\nin my family, but still you will allow me to hope that this\r\nmight put it close to the year 2100. Congress periodically\r\nconsiders legislative proposals that would allow the ownership\r\nof facts.5 The Digital Millennium Copyright Act gives content\r\nproviders a whole array of legally protected digital fences to\r\nenclose their work.6 In some cases it effectively removes the\r\nprivilege of fair use. Each day brings some new Internet horror\r\nstory about the excesses of intellectual property. Some of them\r\nare even true. The list goes on and on. (By the end of this\r\nbook, I hope to have convinced you that this matters.) With all\r\nof this going on, this enclosure movement of the mind, this\r\nlocking up of symbols and themes and facts and genes and ideas\r\n(and eventually people), why get excited about the patenting of\r\na peanut butter and jelly sandwich? \"I just thought that there\r\nwere limits,\" he said; \"some things should be sacred.\"\r\n4\r\n\r\nThis book is an attempt to tell the story of the battles over\r\nintellectual property, the range wars of the information age. I\r\nwant to convince you that intellectual property is important,\r\nthat it is something that any informed citizen needs to know a\r\nlittle about, in the same way that any informed citizen needs to\r\nknow at least something about the environment, or civil rights,\r\nor the way the economy works. I will try my best to be fair, to\r\nexplain the issues and give both sides of the argument. Still,\r\nyou should know that this is more than mere description. In the\r\npages that follow, I try to show that current intellectual\r\nproperty policy is overwhelmingly and tragically bad in ways\r\nthat everyone, and not just lawyers or economists, should care\r\nabout. We are making bad decisions that will have a negative\r\neffect on our culture, our kids' schools, and our communications\r\nnetworks; on free speech, medicine, and scientific research. We\r\nare wasting some of the promise of the Internet, running the\r\nrisk of ruining an amazing system of scientific innovation,\r\ncarving out an intellectual property exemption to the First\r\nAmendment. I do not write this as an enemy of intellectual\r\nproperty, a dot-communist ready to end all property rights; in\r\nfact, I am a fan. It is precisely because I am a fan that I am\r\nso alarmed about the direction we are taking.\r\n5\r\n\r\nStill, the message of this book is neither doom nor gloom. None\r\nof these decisions is irrevocable. The worst ones can still be\r\navoided altogether, and there are powerful counterweights in\r\nboth law and culture to the negative trends I describe here.\r\nThere are lots of reasons for optimism. I will get to most of\r\nthese later, but one bears mentioning now. Contrary to what\r\neveryone has told you, the subject of intellectual property is\r\nboth accessible and interesting; what people can understand,\r\nthey can change--or pressure their legislators to change.\r\n6\r\n\r\nI stress this point because I want to challenge a kind of willed\r\nignorance. Every news story refers to intellectual property as\r\n\"arcane,\" \"technical,\" or \"abstruse\" in the same way as they\r\nreferred to former attorney general Alberto Gonzales as\r\n\"controversial.\" It is a verbal tic and it serves to reinforce\r\nthe idea that this is something about which popular debate is\r\nimpossible. But it is also wrong. The central issues of\r\nintellectual property are not technical, abstruse, or arcane. To\r\nbe sure, the rules of intellectual property law can be as\r\ncomplex as a tax code (though they should not be). But at the\r\nheart of intellectual property law are a set of ideas that a\r\nten-year-old can understand perfectly well. (While writing this\r\nbook, I checked this on a ten-year-old I then happened to have\r\naround the house.) You do not need to be a scientist or an\r\neconomist or a lawyer to understand it. The stuff is also a lot\r\nof fun to think about. I live in constant wonder that they pay\r\nme to do so.\r\n7\r\n\r\nShould you be able to tell the story of Gone With the Wind from\r\na slave's point of view even if the author does not want you to?\r\nShould the Dallas Cowboys be able to stop the release of Debbie\r\nDoes Dallas, a cheesy porno flick, in which the title character\r\nbrings great dishonor to a uniform similar to that worn by the\r\nDallas Cowboys Cheerleaders? (After all, the audience might end\r\nup associating the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders with . . . well,\r\ncommodified sexuality.) 7\r\n8\r\n\r\nShould the U.S. Commerce Department be able to patent the genes\r\nof a Guyami Indian woman who shows an unusual resistance to\r\nleukemia?8 What would it mean to patent someone's genes, anyway?\r\nForbidding scientific research on the gene without the patent\r\nholder's consent? Forbidding human reproduction? Can religions\r\nsecure copyrights over their scriptures? Even the ones they\r\nclaim to have been dictated by gods or aliens? Even if American\r\ncopyright law requires \"an author,\" presumably a human one?9 Can\r\nthey use those copyrights to discipline heretics or critics who\r\ninsist on quoting the scripture in full?\r\n9\r\n\r\nShould anyone own the protocols--the agreed-upon common technical\r\nstandards--that make the Internet possible? Does reading a Web\r\npage count as \"copying\" it?10 Should that question depend on\r\ntechnical \"facts\" (for example, how long the page stays in your\r\nbrowser's cache) or should it depend on some choice that we want\r\nto make about the extent of the copyright holder's rights?\r\n10\r\n\r\nThese questions may be hard, because the underlying moral and\r\npolitical and economic issues need to be thought through. They\r\nmay be weird; alien scriptural dictation might qualify there.\r\nThey surely aren't uninteresting, although I admit to a certain\r\nprejudice on that point. And some of them, like the design of\r\nour telecommunications networks, or the patenting of human\r\ngenes, or the relationship between copyright and free speech,\r\nare not merely interesting, they are important. It seems like a\r\nbad idea to leave them to a few lawyers and lobbyists simply\r\nbecause you are told they are \"technical.\"\r\n11\r\n\r\nSo the first goal of the book is to introduce you to\r\nintellectual property, to explain why it matters, why it is the\r\nlegal form of the information age. The second goal is to\r\npersuade you that our intellectual property policy is going the\r\nwrong way; two roads are diverging and we are on the one that\r\ndoesn't lead to Rome.\r\n12\r\n\r\nThe third goal is harder to explain. We have a simple word for,\r\nand an intuitive understanding of, the complex reality of\r\n\"property.\" Admittedly, lawyers think about property differently\r\nfrom the way lay-people do; this is only one of the strange\r\nmental changes that law school brings. But everyone in our\r\nsociety has a richly textured understanding of \"mine\" and\r\n\"thine,\" of rights of exclusion, of division of rights over the\r\nsame property (for example, between tenant and landlord), of\r\ntransfer of rights in part or in whole (for example, rental or\r\nsale). But what about the opposite of property--property's\r\nantonym, property's outside? What is it? Is it just stuff that\r\nis not worth owning--abandoned junk? Stuff that is not yet\r\nowned--such as a seashell on a public beach, about to be taken\r\nhome? Or stuff that cannot be owned--a human being, for example?\r\nOr stuff that is collectively owned--would that be the radio\r\nspectrum or a public park? Or stuff that is owned by no one,\r\nsuch as the deep seabed or the moon? Property's outside, whether\r\nit is \"the public domain\" or \"the commons,\" turns out to be\r\nharder to grasp than its inside. To the extent that we think\r\nabout property's outside, it tends to have a negative\r\nconnotation; we want to get stuff out of the lost-and-found\r\noffice and back into circulation as property. We talk of \"the\r\ntragedy of the commons,\"11 meaning that unowned or collectively\r\nowned resources will be managed poorly; the common pasture will\r\nbe overgrazed by the villagers' sheep because no one has an\r\nincentive to hold back.\r\n13\r\n\r\nWhen the subject is intellectual property, this gap in our\r\nknowledge turns out to be important because our intellectual\r\nproperty system depends on a balance between what is property\r\nand what is not. For a set of reasons that I will explain later,\r\n\"the opposite of property\" is a concept that is much more\r\nimportant when we come to the world of ideas, information,\r\nexpression, and invention. We want a lot of material to be in\r\nthe public domain, material that can be spread without property\r\nrights. \"The general rule of law is, that the noblest of human\r\nproductions--knowledge, truths ascertained, conceptions, and\r\nideas--become, after voluntary communication to others, free as\r\nthe air to common use.\"12 Our art, our culture, our science\r\ndepend on this public domain every bit as much as they depend on\r\nintellectual property. The third goal of this book is to explore\r\nproperty's outside, property's various antonyms, and to show how\r\nwe are undervaluing the public domain and the information\r\ncommons at the very moment in history when we need them most.\r\nAcademic articles and clever legal briefs cannot solve this\r\nproblem alone.\r\n14\r\n\r\nInstead, I argue that precisely because we are in the\r\ninformation age, we need a movement--akin to the environmental\r\nmovement--to preserve the public domain. The explosion of\r\nindustrial technologies that threatened the environment also\r\ntaught us to recognize its value. The explosion of information\r\ntechnologies has precipitated an intellectual land grab; it must\r\nalso teach us about both the existence and the value of the\r\npublic domain. This enlightenment does not happen by itself. The\r\nenvironmentalists helped us to see the world differently, to see\r\nthat there was such a thing as \"the environment\" rather than\r\njust my pond, your forest, his canal. We need to do the same\r\nthing in the information environment.\r\n15\r\n\r\nWe have to \"invent\" the public domain before we can save it.\r\n16\r\n\r\nA word about style. I am trying to write about complicated\r\nissues, some of which have been neglected by academic\r\nscholarship, while others have been catalogued in detail. I want\r\nto advance the field, to piece together the story of the second\r\nenclosure movement, to tell you something new about the balance\r\nbetween property and its opposite. But I want to do so in a way\r\nthat is readable. For those in my profession, being readable is\r\na dangerous goal. You have never heard true condescension until\r\nyou have heard academics pronounce the word \"popularizer.\" They\r\nsay it as Isadora Duncan might have said \"dowdy.\" To be honest,\r\nI share their concern. All too often, clarity is achieved by\r\nleaving out the key qualification necessary to the argument, the\r\nsubtlety of meaning, the inconvenient empirical evidence.\r\n17\r\n\r\nMy solution is not a terribly satisfactory one. A lot of\r\nmaterial has been exiled to endnotes. The endnotes for each\r\nchapter also include a short guide to further reading. I have\r\nused citations sparingly, but more widely than an author of a\r\npopular book normally does, so that the scholarly audience can\r\ntrace out my reasoning. But the core of the argument is in the\r\ntext.\r\n18\r\n\r\nThe second balance I have struggled to hit is that between\r\nbreadth and depth. The central thesis of the book is that the\r\nline between intellectual property and the public domain is\r\nimportant in every area of culture, science, and technology. As\r\na result, it ranges widely in subject matter. Yet readers come\r\nwith different backgrounds, interests, and bodies of knowledge.\r\nAs a result, the structure of the book is designed to facilitate\r\nself-selection based on interest. The first three chapters and\r\nthe conclusion provide the theoretical basis. Each chapter\r\nbuilds on those themes, but is also designed to be largely\r\nfreestanding. The readers who thrill to the idea that there\r\nmight be constitutional challenges to the regulation of digital\r\nspeech by copyright law may wallow in those arguments to their\r\nhearts' content. Others may quickly grasp the gist and head on\r\nfor the story of how Ray Charles's voice ended up in a mashup\r\nattacking President Bush, or the discussion of genetically\r\nengineered bacteria that take photographs and are themselves the\r\nsubject of intellectual property rights. To those readers who\r\nnevertheless conclude that I have failed to balance correctly\r\nbetween precision and clarity, or breadth and depth, I offer my\r\napologies. I fear you may be right. It was not for want of\r\ntrying.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 1: Why Intellectual Property\r\n1\r\n\r\nImagine yourself starting a society from scratch. Perhaps you\r\nfought a revolution, or perhaps you led a party of adventurers\r\ninto some empty land, conveniently free of indigenous peoples.\r\nNow your task is to make the society work. You have a preference\r\nfor democracy and liberty and you want a vibrant culture: a\r\nculture with a little chunk of everything, one that offers\r\nhundreds of ways to live and thousands of ideals of beauty. You\r\ndon't want everything to be high culture; you want beer and\r\nskittles and trashy delights as well as brilliant news\r\nreporting, avant-garde theater, and shocking sculpture. You can\r\nsee a role for highbrow, state-supported media or publicly\r\nfinanced artworks, but your initial working assumption is that\r\nthe final arbiter of culture should be the people who watch,\r\nread, and listen to it, and who remake it every day. And even if\r\nyou are dubious about the way popular choice gets formed, you\r\nprefer it to some government funding body or coterie of art\r\nmavens.\r\n2\r\n\r\nAt the same time as you are developing your culture, you want a\r\nflourishing economy--and not just in literature or film. You want\r\ninnovation and invention. You want drugs that cure terrible\r\ndiseases, and designs for more fuel-efficient stoves, and useful\r\nlittle doodads, like mousetraps, or Post-it notes, or solar-\r\npowered backscratchers. To be exact, you want lots of innovation\r\nbut you do not know exactly what innovation or even what types\r\nof innovation you want.\r\n3\r\n\r\nGiven scarce time and resources, should we try to improve\r\ntypewriters or render them obsolete with word processors, or\r\ndevelop functional voice recognition software, or just\r\nconcentrate on making solar-powered backscratchers? Who knew\r\nthat they needed Post-it notes or surgical stents or specialized\r\nrice planters until those things were actually developed? How do\r\nyou make priorities when the priorities include things you\r\ncannot rationally value because you do not have them yet? How do\r\nyou decide what to fund and when to fund it, what desires to\r\ntrade off against each other?\r\n4\r\n\r\nThe society you have founded normally relies on market signals\r\nto allocate resources. If a lot of people want petunias for\r\ntheir gardens, and are willing to pay handsomely for them, then\r\nsome farmer who was formerly growing soybeans or gourds will\r\ndevote a field to petunias instead. He will compete with the\r\nother petunia sellers to sell them to you. Voila! We do not need\r\na state planner to consult the vegetable five-year plan and\r\ndecree \"Petunias for the People!\" Instead, the decision about\r\nhow to deploy society's productive resources is being made\r\n\"automatically,\" cybernetically even, by rational individuals\r\nresponding to price signals. And in a competitive market, you\r\nwill get your petunias at very close to the cost of growing them\r\nand bringing them to market. Consumer desires are satisfied and\r\nproductive resources are allocated efficiently. It's a tour de\r\nforce.\r\n5\r\n\r\nOf course, there are problems. The market measures the value of\r\na good by whether people have the ability and willingness to pay\r\nfor it, so the whims of the rich may be more \"valuable\" than the\r\nneeds of the destitute. We may spend more on pet psychiatry for\r\nthe traumatized poodles on East 71st Street than on developing a\r\ncure for sleeping sickness, because the emotional wellbeing of\r\nthe pets of the wealthy is \"worth more\" than the lives of the\r\ntropical world's poor. But for a lot of products, in a lot of\r\nareas, the market works--and that is a fact not to be taken for\r\ngranted.\r\n6\r\n\r\nWhy not use this mechanism to meet your cultural and innovation\r\nneeds? If people need Madame Bovary or The New York Times or a\r\nnew kind of antibiotic, surely the market will provide it?\r\nApparently not. You have brought economists with you into your\r\nbrave new world--perhaps out of nostalgia, or because a lot of\r\npacking got done at the last minute. The economists shake their\r\nheads.1 The petunia farmer is selling something that is \"a\r\nrivalrous good.\" If I have the petunia, you can't have it.\r\nWhat's more, petunias are \"excludable.\" The farmer only gives\r\nyou petunias when you pay for them. It is these factors that\r\nmake the petunia market work. What about Madame Bovary, or the\r\nantibiotic, or The New York Times? Well, it depends. If books\r\nhave to be copied out by hand, then Madame Bovary is just like\r\nthe petunia. But if thousands of copies of Madame Bovary can be\r\nprinted on a printing press, or photocopied, or downloaded from\r\nwww.flaubertsparrot.com, then the book becomes something that is\r\nnonrival; once Madame Bovary is written, it can satisfy many\r\nreaders with little additional effort or cost. Indeed, depending\r\non the technologies of reproduction, it may be very hard to\r\nexclude people from Madame Bovary.\r\n7\r\n\r\nImagine a Napster for French literature; everyone could have\r\nMadame Bovary and only the first purchaser would have to pay for\r\nit. Because of these \"nonrival\" and \"nonexcludable\"\r\ncharacteristics, Flaubert's publisher would have a more\r\ndifficult time coming up with a business plan than the petunia\r\nfarmer. The same is true for the drug company that invests\r\nmillions in screening and testing various drug candidates and\r\nends up with a new antibiotic that is both safe and effective,\r\nbut which can be copied for pennies. Who will invest the money,\r\nknowing that any product can be undercut by copies that don't\r\nhave to pay the research costs? How are authors and publishers\r\nand drug manufacturers to make money? And if they can't make\r\nmoney, how are we to induce people to be authors or to be the\r\ninvestors who put money into the publishing or pharmaceutical\r\nbusiness?\r\n8\r\n\r\nIt is important to pause at this point and inquire how closely\r\nreality hews to the economic story of \"nonexcludable\" and\r\n\"nonrival\" public goods. It turns out that the reality is much\r\nmore complex. First, there may be motivations for creation that\r\ndo not depend on the market mechanism. People sometimes create\r\nbecause they seek fame, or out of altruism, or because an\r\ninherent creative force will not let them do otherwise. Where\r\nthose motivations operate, we may not need a financial incentive\r\nto create. Thus the \"problem\" of cheap copying in fact becomes a\r\nvirtue. Second, the same technologies that make copying cheaper\r\nmay also lower the costs of advertising and distribution,\r\ncutting down on the need to finance expensive distribution\r\nchains. Third, even in situations that do require incentives for\r\ncreativity and for distribution, it may be that being \"first to\r\nmarket\" with an innovation provides the innovator with enough of\r\na head start on the competition to support the innovation.2\r\nFourth, while some aspects of the innovation may truly be\r\nnonrival, other aspects may not. Software is nonrival and hard\r\nto exclude people from, but it is easy to exclude your customers\r\nfrom the help line or technical support. The CD may be copied\r\ncheaply; the concert is easy to police. The innovator may even\r\nbe advantaged by being able to trade on the likely effects of\r\nher innovation. If I know I have developed the digital camera, I\r\nmay sell the conventional film company's shares short.\r\nGuarantees of authenticity, quality, and ease of use may attract\r\npurchasers even if unauthorized copying is theoretically\r\ncheaper.\r\n9\r\n\r\nIn other words, the economic model of pure public goods will\r\ntrack our reality well in some areas and poorly in others--and\r\nthe argument for state intervention to fix the problems of\r\npublic goods will therefore wax and wane correspondingly. In the\r\ncase of drug patents, for example, it is very strong. For lots\r\nof low-level business innovation, however, we believe that\r\nadequate incentives are provided by being first to market, and\r\nso we see no need to give monopoly power to the first business\r\nto come up with a new business plan--at least we did not until\r\nsome disastrous patent law decisions discussed later in this\r\nbook. Nor does a lowering of copying costs hurt every industry\r\nequally. Digital copies of music were a threat to the\r\ntraditional music business, but digital copies of books? I am\r\nskeptical. This book will be freely and legally available online\r\nto all who wish to copy it. Both the publisher and I believe\r\nthat this will increase rather than decrease sales.\r\n10\r\n\r\nIgnore these inconvenient complicating factors for a moment.\r\nAssume that wherever things are cheap to copy and hard to\r\nexclude others from, we have a potential collapse of the market.\r\nThat book, that drug, that film will simply not be produced in\r\nthe first place--unless the state steps in somehow to change the\r\nequation. This is the standard argument for intellectual\r\nproperty rights. And a very good argument it is. In order to\r\nsolve the potentially \"marketbreaking\" problem of goods that are\r\nexpensive to make and cheap to copy, we will use what my\r\ncolleague Jerry Reichman calls the \"market-making\" device of\r\nintellectual property. The state will create a right to exclude\r\nothers from the invention or the expression and confer it on the\r\ninventor or the author. The most familiar rights of this kind\r\nare copyrights and patents. (Trademarks present some special\r\nissues, which I will address a little later.) Having been given\r\nthe ability to forbid people to copy your invention or your\r\nnovel, you can make them pay for the privilege of getting\r\naccess. You have been put back in the position of the petunia\r\nfarmer.\r\n11\r\n\r\nPause for a moment and think of what a brilliant social\r\ninnovation this is--at least potentially. Focus not on the\r\nincentives alone, but on the decentralization of information\r\nprocessing and decision making that a market offers. Instead of\r\nhaving ministries of art that define the appropriate culture to\r\nbe produced this year, or turning the entire path of national\r\ninnovation policy over to the government, intellectual property\r\ndecentralizes the choices about what creative and innovative\r\npaths to pursue while retaining the possibility that people will\r\nactually get paid for their innovation and creative expression.\r\n\r\n1\r\n12\r\n\r\nThe promise of copyright is this: if you are a radical\r\nenvironmentalist who wants to alert the world to the danger\r\nposed by climate change, or a passionate advocate of\r\nhomeschooling, or a cartoonist with a uniquely twisted view of\r\nlife, or a musician who can make a slack key guitar do very\r\nstrange things, or a person who likes to take amazingly\r\nsaccharine pictures of puppies and put them on greeting\r\ncards--maybe you can quit your day job and actually make a living\r\nfrom your expressive powers. If the market works, if the\r\nmiddlemen and distributors are smart enough, competitive enough,\r\nand willing to take a chance on expression that competes with\r\ntheir in-house talent, if you can make it somehow into the\r\npublic consciousness, then you can be paid for allowing the\r\nworld to copy, distribute, and perform your stuff. You risk your\r\ntime and your effort and your passion and, if the market likes\r\nit, you will be rewarded. (At the very least, the giant\r\nproducers of culture will be able to assemble vast teams of\r\nanimators and musicians and software gurus and meld their labors\r\ninto a videotape that will successfully anesthetize your\r\nchildren for two hours; no small accomplishment, let me tell\r\nyou, and one for which people will certainly pay.)\r\n13\r\n\r\nMore importantly, if the system works, the choices about the\r\ncontent of our culture--the mix of earnest essays and saccharine\r\ngreeting cards and scantily clad singers and poetic renditions\r\nof Norse myths--will be decentralized to the people who actually\r\nread, or listen to, or watch the stuff. This is our cultural\r\npolicy and it is driven, in part, by copyright.\r\n14\r\n\r\nThe promise of patent is this: we have a multitude of human\r\nneeds and a multitude of individuals and firms who might be able\r\nto satisfy those needs through innovation. Patent law offers us\r\na decentralized system that, in principle, will allow\r\nindividuals and firms to pick the problem that they wish to\r\nsolve. Inventors and entrepreneurs can risk their time and their\r\ncapital and, if they produce a solution that finds favor in the\r\nmarketplace, will be able to reap the return provided by the\r\nlegal right to exclude--by the legal monopoly over the resulting\r\ninvention. The market hints at some unmet need--for drugs that\r\nmight reduce obesity or cure multiple sclerosis, or for Post-it\r\nnotes or windshield wipers that come on intermittently in light\r\nrain--and the innovator and her investors make a bet that they\r\ncan meet that need. (Not all of these technologies will be\r\npatentable--only those that are novel and \"nonobvious,\" something\r\nthat goes beyond what any skilled person in the relevant field\r\nwould have done.)\r\n15\r\n\r\nIn return for the legal monopoly, patent holders must describe\r\nthe technology well enough to allow anyone to replicate it once\r\nthe patent term ends. Thus patent law allows us to avert two\r\ndangers: the danger that the innovation will languish because\r\nthe inventor has no way to recover her investment of time and\r\ncapital, and the danger that the inventor will turn to secrecy\r\ninstead, hiding the details of her innovation behind black box\r\ntechnologies and restrictive contracts, so that society never\r\ngets the knowledge embedded in it. (This is a real danger. The\r\nmedieval guilds often relied on secrecy to maintain the\r\ncommercial advantage conveyed by their special skills, thus\r\nslowing progress down and sometimes simply stopping it. We still\r\ndon't know how they made Stradivarius violins sound so good.\r\nPatents, by contrast, keep the knowledge public, at least in\r\ntheory;3 you must describe it to own it.) And again, decisions\r\nabout the direction of innovation have been largely, though not\r\nentirely, decentralized to the people who actually might use the\r\nproducts and services that result. This is our innovation policy\r\nand it is increasingly driven by patent.\r\n16\r\n\r\nWhat about the legal protection of trademarks, the little words\r\nor symbols or product shapes that identify products for us? Why\r\ndo we have trademark law, this \"homestead law for the English\r\nlanguage\"?4 Why not simply allow anyone to use any name or\r\nattractive symbol that they want on their products, even if\r\nsomeone else used it first? A trademark gives me a limited right\r\nto exclude other people from using my mark, or brand name, or\r\nproduct shape, just as copyright and patent law give me a\r\nlimited right to exclude other people from my original\r\nexpression or my novel invention. Why create such a right and\r\nback it with the force of law?\r\n17\r\n\r\nAccording to the economists, the answer is that trademark law\r\ndoes two things. It saves consumers time. We have good reason to\r\nbelieve that a soap that says \"Ivory\" or a tub of ice cream that\r\nsays \"Häagen-Dazs\" will be made by the same manufacturer that\r\nmade the last batch of Ivory soap or Häagen-Dazs ice cream. If\r\nwe liked the good before and we see the symbol again, we know\r\nwhat we are getting. I can work out what kind of soap, ice\r\ncream, or car I like, and then just look for the appropriate\r\nsign rather than investigating the product all over again each\r\ntime I buy. That would be wasteful and economists hate waste. At\r\nthe same time, trademarks fulfill a second function: they are\r\nsupposed to give manufacturers an incentive to make good\r\nproducts--or at least to make products of consistent quality or\r\nprice--to build up a good brand name and invest in consistency of\r\nits key features, knowing that no other firm can take their name\r\nor symbol. (Why produce a high-quality product, or a reliable\r\ncheap product, and build a big market share if a free rider\r\ncould wait until people liked the product and then just produce\r\nan imitation with the same name but of lower quality?) The\r\npromise of trademark is that quality and commercial information\r\nflow regulate themselves, with rational consumers judging among\r\ngoods of consistent quality produced by manufacturers with an\r\ninterest in building up long-term reputation.\r\n18\r\n\r\nSo there we have the idealized vision of intellectual property.\r\nIt is not merely supposed to produce incentives for innovation\r\nby rewarding creators, though that is vital. Intellectual\r\nproperty is also supposed to create a feedback mechanism that\r\ndictates the contours of information and innovation production.\r\nIt is not an overstatement to say that intellectual property\r\nrights are designed to shape our information marketplace.\r\nCopyright law is supposed to give us a self-regulating cultural\r\npolicy in which the right to exclude others from one's original\r\nexpression fuels a vibrant public sphere indirectly driven by\r\npopular demand. At its best, it is supposed to allow a\r\ndecentralized and iconoclastic cultural ferment in which\r\nindependent artists, musicians, and writers can take their\r\nunique visions, histories, poems, or songs to the world--and make\r\na living doing so if their work finds favor. Patent law is\r\nsupposed to give us a self-regulating innovation policy in which\r\nthe right to exclude others from novel and useful inventions\r\ncreates a cybernetic and responsive innovation marketplace. The\r\nallocation of social resources to particular types of innovation\r\nis driven by guesses about what the market wants. Trademark law\r\nis supposed to give us a self-regulating commercial information\r\npolicy in which the right to exclude others from one's trade\r\nname, symbol, or slogan produces a market for consumer\r\ninformation in which firms have incentives to establish quality\r\nbrand names and consumers can rely on the meaning and the\r\nstability of the logos that surround them. Ivory soap will\r\nalways mean Ivory soap and Coke will mean Coke, at least until\r\nthe owners of those marks decide to change the nature of their\r\nproducts.\r\n19\r\n\r\nSome readers will find my use of the term \"intellectual\r\nproperty\" mistaken and offensive. They will argue, and I agree,\r\nthat the use of the term \"property\" can cause people mistakenly\r\nto conflate these rights with those to physical property. (I\r\noutline that process and its negative consequences in the next\r\nchapter.) They will argue, and again I agree, that there are big\r\ndifferences between the three fields I have described. Should we\r\nnot just list the specific rights about which we are\r\nspeaking--copyright, patent, or trademark? Both of these concerns\r\nare real and well-founded, but I respectfully disagree with the\r\nconclusion that we should give up the term \"intellectual\r\nproperty.\"\r\n20\r\n\r\nFirst, as I have tried to show above, while there are\r\nconsiderable differences between the three fields I discussed,\r\nthere is also a core similarity--the attempt to use a legally\r\ncreated privilege to solve a potential \"public goods problem.\"\r\nThat similarity can enlighten as well as confuse. Yes, copyright\r\nlooks very different from patent, just as a whale looks very\r\ndifferent from a mouse. But we do not condemn the scientist who\r\nnotes that they are both \"mammals\"--a socially constructed\r\ncategory--so long as he has a reason for focusing on that\r\ncommonality. Second, the language of intellectual property\r\nexists. It has political reality in the world. Sometimes the\r\nlanguage confuses and misleads. There are two possible reactions\r\nto such a reality. One can reject it and insist on a different\r\nand \"purified\" nomenclature, or one can attempt to point out the\r\nmisperceptions and confusions using the very language in which\r\nthey are embedded. I do not reject the first tactic. It can be\r\nuseful. Here, though, I have embraced the second.\r\n21\r\n\r\nI have provided the idealized story of intellectual property.\r\nBut is it true? Did the law really develop that way? Does it\r\nwork that way now? Does this story still apply in the world of\r\nthe Internet and the Human Genome Project? If you believed the\r\nidealized story, would you know what kind of intellectual\r\nproperty laws to write? The answer to all of these questions is\r\n\"not exactly.\"\r\n22\r\n\r\nLike most social institutions, intellectual property has an\r\naltogether messier and more interesting history than this\r\nsanitized version of its functioning would suggest. The\r\nprecursors of copyright law served to force the identification\r\nof the author, so that he could be punished if he proved to be a\r\nheretic or a revolutionary. The Statute of Anne--the first true\r\ncopyright statute--was produced partly because of publishers'\r\nfights with booksellers; the authorial right grew as an\r\nafterthought.5 The history of patents includes a wealth of\r\nattempts to reward friends of the government and restrict or\r\ncontrol dangerous technologies. Trademark law has shuttled\r\nuneasily between being a free-floating way to police competition\r\nso as to prohibit actions that courts thought were \"unfair\" and\r\nan absolute property right over an individual word or symbol.\r\n23\r\n\r\nBut does intellectual property work this way now, promoting the\r\nideal of progress, a transparent marketplace, easy and cheap\r\naccess to information, decentralized and iconoclastic cultural\r\nproduction, self-correcting innovation policy? Often it does,\r\nbut distressingly often it does the reverse. The rights that\r\nwere supposed to be limited in time and scope to the minimum\r\nmonopoly necessary to ensure production become instead a kind of\r\nperpetual corporate welfare--restraining the next generation of\r\ncreators instead of encouraging them. The system that was\r\nsupposed to harness the genius of both the market and democracy\r\nsometimes subverts both. Worse, it does so inefficiently,\r\nlocking up vast swaths of culture in order to confer a benefit\r\non a tiny minority of works. But this is too abstract. A single\r\ninstance from copyright law will serve as a concrete example of\r\nwhat is at stake here. Later in the book I will give other\r\nexamples.\r\n24\r\n\r\nYOU'LL GET MY LIBRARY OF\r\nCONGRESS WHEN . . .\r\n25\r\n\r\nGo to the Library of Congress catalogue. It is online at\r\nhttp://catalog.loc.gov/. This is an astounding repository of\r\nmaterial--not just books and periodicals, but pictures, films,\r\nand music. The vast majority of this material, perhaps as much\r\nas 95 percent in the case of books, is commercially\r\nunavailable.6 The process happens comparatively quickly.\r\nEstimates suggest that a mere twenty-eight years after\r\npublication 85 percent of the works are no longer being\r\ncommercially produced. (We know that when U.S. copyright\r\nrequired renewal after twenty-eight years, about 85 percent of\r\nall copyright holders did not bother to renew. This is a\r\nreasonable, if rough, guide to commercial viability.)7\r\n26\r\n\r\nYet because the copyright term is now so long, in many cases\r\nextending well over a century, most of twentieth-century culture\r\nis still under copyright--copyrighted but unavailable. Much of\r\nthis, in other words, is lost culture. No one is reprinting the\r\nbooks, screening the films, or playing the songs. No one is\r\nallowed to. In fact, we may not even know who holds the\r\ncopyright. Companies have gone out of business. Records are\r\nincomplete or absent. In some cases, it is even more\r\ncomplicated. A film, for example, might have one copyright over\r\nthe sound track, another over the movie footage, and another\r\nover the script. You get the idea. These works--which are\r\ncommercially unavailable and also have no identifiable copyright\r\nholder--are called \"orphan works.\" They make up a huge percentage\r\nof our great libraries' holdings. For example, scholars estimate\r\nthat the majority of our film holdings are orphan works.8 For\r\nbooks, the estimates are similar. Not only are these works\r\nunavailable commercially, there is simply no way to find and\r\ncontact the person who could agree to give permission to\r\ndigitize the work or make it available in a new form.\r\n27\r\n\r\nTake a conservative set of numbers. Subtract from our totals the\r\nworks that are clearly in the public domain. In the United\r\nStates, that is generally work produced before 1923. That\r\nmaterial, at least, we can use freely. Subtract, too, the works\r\nthat are still available from the copyright holder. There we can\r\ngain access if we are willing to pay. Yet this still leaves a\r\nhuge proportion of twentieth- and twenty-first-century culture\r\ncommercially unavailable but under copyright. In the case of\r\nbooks, the number is over 95 percent, as I said before; with\r\nfilms and music, it is harder to tell, but the percentages are\r\nstill tragically high. A substantial proportion of that total is\r\nmade up of orphan works. They cannot be reprinted or digitized\r\neven if we were willing to pay the owner to do so. And then\r\ncomes the Internet. Right now, you can search for those books or\r\nfilms or songs and have the location of the work instantly\r\ndisplayed, as well as a few details about it. And if you live in\r\nWashington, D.C., or near some other great library, you can go\r\nto a reading room, and if the work can be found and has not been\r\nchecked out, and has not deteriorated, you can read the books\r\n(though you probably will not be able to arrange to see the\r\nmovies unless you are an accredited film scholar).\r\n28\r\n\r\nI was searching the Library of Congress catalogue online one\r\nnight, tracking down a seventy-year-old book about politics and\r\nmarkets, when my son came in to watch me. He was about eight\r\nyears old at the time but already a child of the Internet age.\r\nHe asked what I was doing and I explained that I was printing\r\nout the details of the book so that I could try to find it in my\r\nown university library. \"Why don't you read it online?\" he said,\r\nreaching over my shoulder and double-clicking on the title,\r\nfrowning when that merely led to another information page: \"How\r\ndo you get to read the actual book?\" I smiled at the assumption\r\nthat all the works of literature were not merely in the Library\r\nof Congress, but actually on the Net: available to anyone with\r\nan Internet connection anywhere in the world--so that you could\r\nnot merely search for, but also read or print, some large slice\r\nof the Library's holdings. Imagine what that would be like.\r\nImagine the little underlined blue hyperlink from each title--to\r\nmy son it made perfect sense. The book's title was in the\r\ncatalogue. When you clicked the link, surely you would get to\r\nread it. That is what happened in his experience when one\r\nclicked a link. Why not here? It was an old book, after all, no\r\nlonger in print. Imagine being able to read the books, hear the\r\nmusic, or watch the films--or at least the ones that the Library\r\nof Congress thought it worthwhile to digitize. Of course, that\r\nis ridiculous.\r\n29\r\n\r\nI tried to explain this to my son. I showed him that there were\r\nsome works that could be seen online. I took him to the online\r\nphotograph library, meaning to show him the wealth of amazing\r\nhistorical photographs. Instead, I found myself brooding over\r\nthe lengthy listing of legal restrictions on the images and the\r\nexplanation that reproduction of protected items may require the\r\nwritten permission of the copyright owners and that, in many\r\ncases, only indistinct and tiny thumbnail images are displayed\r\nto those searching from outside the Library of Congress \"because\r\nof potential rights considerations.\" The same was true of the\r\nscratchy folk songs from the twenties or the early film\r\nholdings. The material was in the Library, of course--remarkable\r\ncollections in some cases, carefully preserved, and sometimes\r\neven digitized at public expense. Yet only a tiny fraction of it\r\nis available online. (There is a fascinating set of Edison's\r\nearly films, for example.)\r\n30\r\n\r\nMost of the material available online comes from so long ago\r\nthat the copyright could not possibly still be in force. But\r\nsince copyright lasts for seventy years after the death of the\r\nauthor (or ninety-five years if it was a corporate \"work for\r\nhire\"), that could be a very, very long time indeed. Long\r\nenough, in fact, to keep off limits almost the whole history of\r\nmoving pictures and the entire history of recorded music. Long\r\nenough to lock up almost all of twentieth-century culture.\r\n31\r\n\r\nBut is that not what copyright is supposed to do? To grant the\r\nright to restrict access, so as to allow authors to charge for\r\nthe privilege of obtaining it? Yes, indeed. And this is a very\r\ngood idea. But as I argue in this book, the goal of the system\r\nought to be to give the monopoly only for as long as necessary\r\nto provide an incentive. After that, we should let the work fall\r\ninto the public domain where all of us can use it, transform it,\r\nadapt it, build on it, republish it as we wish. For most works,\r\nthe owners expect to make all the money they are going to recoup\r\nfrom the work with five or ten years of exclusive rights. The\r\nrest of the copyright term is of little use to them except as a\r\nkind of lottery ticket in case the work proves to be a one-in-a-\r\nmillion perennial favorite. The one-in-a-million lottery winner\r\nwill benefit, of course, if his ticket comes up. And if the\r\nticket is \"free,\" who would not take it? But the ticket is not\r\nfree to the public. They pay higher prices for the works still\r\nbeing commercially exploited and, frequently, the price of\r\ncomplete unavailability for the works that are not.\r\n32\r\n\r\nThink of a one-in-a-million perennial favorite--Harry Potter,\r\nsay. Long after J. K. Rowling is dust, we will all be forbidden\r\nfrom making derivative works, or publishing cheap editions or\r\nlarge-type versions, or simply reproducing it for pleasure. I am\r\na great admirer of Ms. Rowling's work, but my guess is that\r\nlittle extra incentive was provided by the thought that her\r\ncopyright will endure seventy rather than merely fifty years\r\nafter her death. Some large costs are being imposed here, for a\r\nsmall benefit. And the costs fall even more heavily on all the\r\nother works, which are available nowhere but in some moldering\r\nlibrary stacks. To put it another way, if copyright owners had\r\nto purchase each additional five years of term separately, the\r\nsame way we buy warranties on our appliances, the economically\r\nrational ones would mainly settle for a fairly short period.\r\n33\r\n\r\nOf course, there are some works that are still being exploited\r\ncommercially long after their publication date. Obviously the\r\nowners of these works would not want them freely available\r\nonline. This seems reasonable enough, though even with those\r\nworks the copyright should expire eventually. But remember, in\r\nthe Library of Congress's vast, wonderful pudding of songs and\r\npictures and films and books and magazines and newspapers, there\r\nis perhaps a handful of raisins' worth of works that anyone is\r\nmaking any money from, and the vast majority of those come from\r\nthe last ten years. If one goes back twenty years, perhaps a\r\nraisin. Fifty years? A slight raisiny aroma. We restrict access\r\nto the whole pudding in order to give the owners of the raisin\r\nslivers their due. But this pudding is almost all of twentieth-\r\ncentury culture, and we are restricting access to it when almost\r\nof all of it could be available.\r\n34\r\n\r\nIf you do not know much about copyright, you might think that I\r\nam exaggerating. After all, if no one has any financial interest\r\nin the works or we do not even know who owns the copyright,\r\nsurely a library would be free to put those works online?\r\nDoesn't \"no harm, no foul\" apply in the world of copyright? In a\r\nword, no. Copyright is what lawyers call a \"strict liability\"\r\nsystem. This means that it is generally not a legal excuse to\r\nsay that you did not believe you were violating copyright, or\r\nthat you did so by accident, or in the belief that no one would\r\ncare, and that your actions benefited the public. Innocence and\r\nmistake do not absolve you, though they might reduce the\r\npenalties imposed. Since it is so difficult to know exactly who\r\nowns the copyright (or copyrights) on a work, many libraries\r\nsimply will not reproduce the material or make it available\r\nonline until they can be sure the copyright has expired--which\r\nmay mean waiting for over a century. They cannot afford to take\r\nthe risk.\r\n35\r\n\r\nWhat is wrong with this picture? Copyright has done its job and\r\nencouraged the creation of the work. But now it acts as a fence,\r\nkeeping us out and restricting access to the work to those who\r\nhave the time and resources to trudge through the stacks of the\r\nnation's archives. In some cases, as with film, it may simply\r\nmake the work completely unavailable.\r\n36\r\n\r\nSo far I have been talking as though copyright were the only\r\nreason the material is not freely available online. But of\r\ncourse, this is not true. Digitizing costs money (though less\r\nevery year) and there is a lot of rubbish out there, stuff no\r\none would ever want to make available digitally (though it must\r\nbe noted that one man's rubbish is another man's delight). But\r\nthat still leaves vast amounts of material that we would want,\r\nand be willing to pay, to have digitized. Remember also that if\r\nthe material were legally free, anyone could get in on the act\r\nof digitizing it and putting it up. Google's much-heralded\r\neffort to scan the books in major libraries is just the kind of\r\nthing I mean. But Google is being sued for violating\r\ncopyright--even though it allows any author to \"opt out\" of its\r\nsystem, and even though under the Google system you cannot click\r\nto get the book if it is still under copyright, merely a snippet\r\na few sentences long from the book.\r\n37\r\n\r\nIf you are shaking your head as you read this, saying that no\r\none would bother digitizing most of the material in the\r\narchives, look at the Internet and ask yourself where the\r\ninformation came from the last time you did a search. Was it an\r\nofficial and prestigious institution? A university or a museum\r\nor a government? Sometimes those are our sources of information,\r\nof course. But do you not find the majority of the information\r\nyou need by wandering off into a strange click-trail of sites,\r\namateur and professional, commercial and not, hobbyist and\r\nentrepreneur, all self-organized by internal referrals and\r\nsearch engine algorithms? Even if Google did not undertake the\r\ntask of digitization, there would be hundreds, thousands, maybe\r\nmillions of others who would--not with Google's resources, to be\r\nsure. In the process, they would create something quite\r\nremarkable.\r\n38\r\n\r\nThe most satisfying proofs are existence proofs. A platypus is\r\nan existence proof that mammals can lay eggs. The Internet is an\r\nexistence proof of the remarkable information processing power\r\nof a decentralized network of hobbyists, amateurs, universities,\r\nbusinesses, volunteer groups, professionals, and retired experts\r\nand who knows what else. It is a network that produces useful\r\ninformation and services. Frequently, it does so at no cost to\r\nthe user and without anyone guiding it. Imagine that energy,\r\nthat decentralized and idiosyncratically dispersed pattern of\r\ninterests, turned loose on the cultural artifacts of the\r\ntwentieth century. Then imagine it coupled to the efforts of the\r\ngreat state archives and private museums who themselves would be\r\nfree to do the same thing. Think of the people who would work on\r\nBuster Keaton, or the literary classics of the 1930s, or the\r\nfilms of the Second World War, or footage on the daily lives of\r\nAfrican-Americans during segregation, or the music of the Great\r\nDepression, or theremin recordings, or the best of vaudeville.\r\nImagine your Google search in such a world. Imagine that Library\r\nof Congress. One science fiction writer has taken a stab. His\r\ncharacter utters the immortal line, \"Man, you'll get my Library\r\nof Congress when you pry my cold dead fingers off it!\" 9\r\n39\r\n\r\nFamiliar with the effect of this kind of train of thought on his\r\nfather, my son had long since wandered off in search of a\r\nbasketball game to watch. But I have to admit his question was\r\nsomething of an epiphany for me: Where do you click to get the\r\nactual book?\r\n40\r\n\r\nThe response I get from a lot of people is that this vision of\r\nthe Library of Congress is communism, pure and simple. Such\r\npeople view Google's attempt to digitize books as simple theft.\r\nSurely it will destroy the incentives necessary to produce the\r\nnext beach novel, the next academic monograph, the next teen\r\nband CD, the next hundred-million-dollar movie? But this\r\nmistakes my suggestion. Imagine a very conservative system.\r\nFirst, let us make people demonstrate that they want a\r\ncopyright, by the arduous step of actually writing the word\r\ncopyright or the little (C) on the work. (At the moment, everyone\r\ngets a copyright as soon as the work is written down or\r\notherwise fixed, whether they want one or not.) But how long a\r\ncopyright? We know that the majority of works are only valuable\r\nfor five or ten years. Let us give copyright owners more than\r\ndouble that, say twenty-eight years of exclusive rights. If\r\nprior experience is any guide, 85 percent of works will be\r\nallowed to enter the public domain after that period. If that\r\nisn't generous enough, let us say that the small proportion of\r\nowners who still find value in their copyright at the end of\r\ntwenty-eight years can extend their copyright for another\r\ntwenty-eight years. Works that are not renewed fall immediately\r\ninto the public domain. If you check the register after twenty-\r\neight years and the work has not been renewed, it is in the\r\npublic domain. Works that are renewed get the extra time.\r\n41\r\n\r\nNow this is a conservative suggestion, too conservative in my\r\nview, though still better than what we have now. Is it feasible?\r\nIt would be hard to argue that it is not. This pretty much was\r\nthe law in the United States until 1978. (My system is a little\r\nsimpler, but the broad strokes are the same.) Since that point,\r\nin two broad stages, we have moved away from this system at the\r\nvery moment in history when the Internet made it a particularly\r\nstupid idea to do so.\r\n42\r\n\r\nHow have we changed the system? We have given copyrights to the\r\ncreator of any original work as soon as it is fixed, so that\r\nyou, reader, are the author of thousands of copyrighted works.\r\nAlmost everything up on the Internet is copyrighted, even if its\r\ncreators do not know that and would prefer it to be in the\r\npublic domain. Imagine that you want to make a documentary and\r\nuse a film clip that a student filmmaker has put up on his home\r\npage. Perhaps you want to adapt the nifty graphics that a high\r\nschool teacher in Hawaii created to teach her calculus class,\r\nthinking that, with a few changes, you could use the material\r\nfor your state's K-12 physics program. Perhaps you are a collage\r\nartist who wishes to incorporate images that amateur artists\r\nhave put online. None of the works are marked by a copyright\r\nsymbol. Certainly they are up on the Internet, but does that\r\nmean that they are available for reprinting, adaptation, or\r\nincorporation in a new work?\r\n43\r\n\r\nIn each of these cases, you simply do not know whether what you\r\nare doing is legal or not. Of course, you can take the risk,\r\nthough that becomes less advisable if you want to share your\r\nwork with others. Each broadening of the circle of sharing\r\nincreases the value to society but also the legal danger to you.\r\nWhat if you want to put the course materials on the Net, or\r\npublish the anthology, or display the movie? Perhaps you can try\r\nto persuade your publisher or employer or distributor to take\r\nthe risk. Perhaps you can track down the authors of every piece\r\nyou wish to use and puzzle through the way to get a legal\r\nrelease from them stating that they give you permission to use\r\nthe work they did not even know they had copyright over. Or you\r\ncan give up. Whatever happens, you waste time and effort in\r\ntrying to figure out a way of getting around a system that is\r\ndesigned around neither your needs nor the needs of many of the\r\npeople whose work you want to use.\r\n44\r\n\r\nApart from doing away with the need to indicate that you want\r\nyour works to be copyrighted, we have lengthened the copyright\r\nterm. We did this without any credible evidence that it was\r\nnecessary to encourage innovation. We have extended the terms of\r\nliving and even of dead authors over works that have already\r\nbeen created. (It is hard to argue that this was a necessary\r\nincentive, what with the works already existing and the authors\r\noften being dead.) We have done away with the need to renew the\r\nright. Everyone gets the term of life plus seventy years, or\r\nninety-five years for corporate \"works for hire.\" All protected\r\nby a \"strict liability\" system with scary penalties. And, as I\r\nsaid before, we have made all those choices just when the\r\nInternet makes their costs particularly tragic.\r\n45\r\n\r\nIn sum, we have forgone the Library of Congress I described\r\nwithout even apparently realizing we were doing so. We have\r\nlocked up most of twentieth-century culture and done it in a\r\nparticularly inefficient and senseless way, creating vast costs\r\nin order to convey proportionally tiny benefits. (And all\r\nwithout much complaint from those who normally object to\r\ninefficient government subsidy programs.) Worst of all, we have\r\nturned the system on its head. Copyright, intended to be the\r\nservant of creativity, a means of promoting access to\r\ninformation, is becoming an obstacle to both.\r\n46\r\n\r\nThat, then, is one example of the stakes of the debate over\r\nintellectual property policy. Unfortunately, the problem of\r\ncopyright terms is just one example, one instance of a larger\r\npattern. As I will try to show, this pattern is repeated again\r\nand again in patents, in trademarks, and elsewhere in copyright\r\nlaw. This is not an isolated \"glitch.\" It is a complicated but\r\nrelentless tendency that has led to a hypertrophy of\r\nintellectual property rights and an assault on the public\r\ndomain. In fact, in many cases, the reality is even worse: there\r\nappears to be a complete ignorance about the value of the public\r\ndomain. Property's opposite, its outside, is getting short\r\nshrift.\r\n47\r\n\r\nTo paraphrase a song from my youth, \"how did we get here?\" Where\r\nshould we turn to understand the role of intellectual property\r\nin the era of the Internet and the decoding of the human genome?\r\nWe could turn to the cutting edge of technology or to economics\r\nor information theory. But none of those would be as useful a\r\nstarting place as a letter that was written about two hundred\r\nyears ago, using a high-tech quill pen, about a subject far from\r\nthe digital world.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 2: Thomas Jefferson Writes a Letter\r\n1\r\n\r\nOn August 13, 1813, Thomas Jefferson took up his pen to write to\r\nIsaac McPherson.1 It was a quiet week in Jefferson's\r\ncorrespondence. He wrote a letter to Madison about the\r\nappointment of a tax assessor, attempted to procure a government\r\nposition for an acquaintance, produced a fascinating and lengthy\r\nseries of comments on a new \"Rudiments of English Grammar,\"\r\ndiscussed the orthography of nouns ending in \"y,\" accepted the\r\nnecessary delay in the publication of a study on the anatomy of\r\nmammoth bones, completed a brief biography of Governor Lewis,\r\nand, in general, confined himself narrowly in subject matter.2\r\nBut on the 13th of August, Jefferson's mind was on intellectual\r\nproperty, and most specifically, patents.\r\n2\r\n\r\nJefferson's writing is, as usual, apparently effortless. Some\r\nfind his penmanship a little hard to decipher. To me, used to\r\nplowing through the frenzied chicken tracks that law students\r\nproduce during exams, it seems perfectly clear. If handwriting\r\ntruly showed the architecture of the soul, then Jefferson's\r\nwould conjure up Monticello or the University of Virginia. There\r\nare a few revisions and interlineations, a couple of words\r\nsqueezed in with a caret at the bottom of the line, but for the\r\nmost part the lines of handwriting simply roll on and on--\"the\r\nfugitive fermentation of an individual brain,\"3 to quote a\r\nphrase from the letter, caught in vellum and ink, though that\r\nbrain has been dust for more than a century and a half.\r\n3\r\n\r\nI love libraries. I love the mushroom smell of gently rotting\r\npaper, the flaky crackle of manuscripts, and the surprise of\r\nmatching style of handwriting with style of thought. Today,\r\nthough, I am viewing his letter over the Internet on a computer\r\nscreen. (You can too. The details are at the back of the book.)\r\n4\r\n\r\nI think Jefferson would have been fascinated by the Internet.\r\nAfter all, this was the man whose library became the Library of\r\nCongress,4 who exemplifies the notion of the brilliant dabbler\r\nin a hundred fields, whose own book collection was clearly a\r\nvital and much consulted part of his daily existence, and whose\r\nvision of politics celebrates the power of an informed\r\ncitizenry. Admittedly, the massive conflicts between Jefferson's\r\nannounced principles and his actions on the issue of slavery\r\nhave led some, though not me, to doubt that there is any\r\nsincerity or moral instruction to be found in his words.5 But\r\neven those who find him a sham can hardly fail to see the\r\ncontinual and obvious joy he felt about knowledge and its\r\nspread.\r\n5\r\n\r\nIn the letter to Isaac McPherson, a letter that has become very\r\nfamous in the world of the digerati,6 this joy becomes manifest.\r\nThe initial subject of the correspondence seems far from the\r\nonline world. McPherson wrote to Jefferson about \"elevators,\r\nconveyers and Hopper-boys.\" Specifically, he wanted to know\r\nJefferson's opinion of a patent that had been issued to Mr.\r\nOliver Evans. Jefferson devotes a paragraph to a recent\r\nretrospective extension of patent rights (he disapproves) and\r\nthen turns to Evans's elevators.\r\n6\r\n\r\nPatents then, as now, were only supposed to be given for\r\ninventions that were novel, nonobvious, and useful. Jefferson\r\nhad considerable doubt whether Evans's device, essentially a\r\nrevolving string of buckets used to move grain, actually counted\r\nas \"an invention.\" \"The question then whether such a string of\r\nbuckets was invented first by Oliver Evans, is a mere question\r\nof fact in mathematical history. Now, turning to such books only\r\nas I happen to possess, I find abundant proof that this simple\r\nmachinery has been in use from time immemorial.\" Jefferson cites\r\nfrom his library example after example of references to the\r\n\"Persian wheel\"--a string of buckets to move water. The display\r\nof scholarship is effortless and without artifice. If the device\r\nexisted to move water, he declares, Mr. Evans can hardly patent\r\nit to move grain. \"If one person invents a knife convenient for\r\npointing our pens, another cannot have a patent right for the\r\nsame knife to point our pencils. A compass was invented for\r\nnavigating the sea; another could not have a patent right for\r\nusing it to survey land.\"7\r\n7\r\n\r\nSo far as we can tell, this was the only part of the letter that\r\ninterested McPherson. Later correspondence indicates that he had\r\na pamphlet printed questioning the patent.8 But while it is\r\nimpressive to see Jefferson's easy command of historical\r\nevidence or his grasp of the importance of limiting the subject\r\nmatter, scope, and duration of patents, these qualities alone\r\nwould not have given the letter the fame it now has. It is when\r\nJefferson turns to the idea of intellectual property itself that\r\nthe letter becomes more than a historical curiosity. In a couple\r\nof pages, quickly jotted down on a humid August day in 1813, he\r\nframes the issue as well as anyone has since.\r\n8\r\n\r\nHe starts by dismissing the idea \"that inventors have a natural\r\nand exclusive right to their inventions, and not merely for\r\ntheir own lives, but inheritable to their heirs.\" In lines that\r\nwill sound strange to those who assume that the framers of the\r\nConstitution were property absolutists, Jefferson argues that\r\n\"stable ownership\" of even tangible property is \"a gift of\r\nsocial law.\" Intellectual property, then, has still less of a\r\nclaim to some permanent, absolute, and natural status.\r\n9\r\n\r\n    [W]hile it is a moot question whether the origin of any kind\r\nof property is derived from nature at all, it would be singular\r\nto admit a natural and even an hereditary right to inventors. It\r\nis agreed by those who have seriously considered the subject,\r\nthat no individual has, of natural right, a separate property in\r\nan acre of land, for instance. By an universal law, indeed,\r\nwhatever, whether fixed or movable, belongs to all men equally\r\nand in common, is the property for the moment of him who\r\noccupies it, but when he relinquishes the occupation, the\r\nproperty goes with it. Stable ownership is the gift of social\r\nlaw, and is given late in the progress of society. It would be\r\ncurious then, if an idea, the fugitive fermentation of an\r\nindividual brain, could, of natural right, be claimed in\r\nexclusive and stable property.9\r\n10\r\n\r\nJefferson's point here may seem obscure to us. We are not used\r\nto starting every argument from first principles. But it is in\r\nfact quite simple. It is society that creates property rights\r\nthat go beyond mere occupancy. It does so for several\r\nreasons--reasons of both practicality and natural justice.\r\n(Elsewhere in his writings, Jefferson expands on this point at\r\ngreater length.) One of those reasons has to do with the\r\ndifficulty, perhaps even the impossibility, of two different\r\npeople having full and unfettered ownership of the same piece of\r\nproperty simultaneously. Another linked reason comes from the\r\npracticality of excluding others from our property, so that we\r\ncan exploit it secure from the plunder or sloth of others. The\r\neconomists you encountered in Chapter 1 have, with their usual\r\nlinguistic felicity, coined the terms \"rivalrous\" and\r\n\"excludable\" to describe these characteristics.\r\n11\r\n\r\nWith rivalrous property, one person's use precludes another's.\r\nIf I drink the milk, you cannot. Excludable property is,\r\nlogically enough, property from which others can easily be\r\nexcluded or kept out. But ideas seem to have neither of these\r\ncharacteristics.\r\n12\r\n\r\n    If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all\r\nothers of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking\r\npower called an idea, which an individual may exclusively\r\npossess as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is\r\ndivulged, it forces itself into the possession of every one, and\r\nthe receiver cannot dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar\r\ncharacter, too, is that no one possess the less, because every\r\nother possess the whole of it. He who receives an idea from me,\r\nreceives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who\r\nlights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me.\r\nThat ideas should freely spread from one to another over the\r\nglobe, for the moral and mutual instruction of man, and\r\nimprovement of his condition, seems to have been peculiarly and\r\nbenevolently designed by nature, when she made them, like fire,\r\nexpansible over all space, without lessening their density in\r\nany point, and like the air in which we breathe, move, and have\r\nour physical being, incapable of confinement or exclusive\r\nappropriation. Inventions then cannot, in nature, be a subject\r\nof property.10\r\n13\r\n\r\nThose who quote the passage sometimes stop here, which is a\r\nshame, because it leaves the impression that Jefferson was\r\nunequivocally against intellectual property rights. But that\r\nwould be a considerable overstatement. When he says that\r\ninventions can never be the subject of property, he means a\r\npermanent and exclusive property right which, as a matter of\r\nnatural right, no just government could abridge. However,\r\ninventions could be covered by temporary state-created\r\nmonopolies instituted for the common good. In the lines\r\nimmediately following the popularly quoted excerpt, Jefferson\r\ngoes on:\r\n14\r\n\r\n    Society may give an exclusive right to the profits arising\r\nfrom [inventions], as an encouragement to men to pursue ideas\r\nwhich may produce utility, but this may or may not be done,\r\naccording to the will and convenience of the society, without\r\nclaim or complaint from any body. Accordingly, it is a fact, as\r\nfar as I am informed, that England was, until we copied her, the\r\nonly country on earth which ever, by a general law, gave a legal\r\nright to the exclusive use of an idea. In some other countries\r\nit is sometimes done, in a great case, and by a special and\r\npersonal act, but, generally speaking, other nations have\r\nthought that these monopolies produce more embarrassment than\r\nadvantage to society; and it may be observed that the nations\r\nwhich refuse monopolies of invention, are as fruitful as England\r\nin new and useful devices.11\r\n15\r\n\r\nJefferson's message was a skeptical recognition that\r\nintellectual property rights might be necessary, a careful\r\nexplanation that they should not be treated as natural rights,\r\nand a warning of the monopolistic dangers that they pose. He\r\nimmediately goes on to say something else, something that is, if\r\nanything, more true in the world of patents on Internet business\r\nmethods and gene sequences than it was in the world of\r\n\"conveyers and Hopper-boys.\"\r\n16\r\n\r\n    Considering the exclusive right to invention as given not of\r\nnatural right, but for the benefit of society, I know well the\r\ndifficulty of drawing a line between the things which are worth\r\nto the public the embarrassment of an exclusive patent, and\r\nthose which are not.12\r\n\r\n17\r\n\r\nSo Jefferson gives us a classic set of cautions, cautions that\r\nwe should be required to repeat, as police officers repeat the\r\nMiranda Warning to a suspect. In this case, they should be\r\nrepeated before we rush off into the world of intellectual\r\nproperty policy rather than before we talk to the police without\r\nour lawyers present.\r\n18\r\n\r\nTHE JEFFERSON WARNING\r\n19\r\n\r\nLike the Miranda Warning, the Jefferson Warning has a number of\r\nimportant parts.\r\n20\r\n\r\n*  First, the stuff we cover with intellectual property rights\r\nhas certain vital differences from the stuff we cover with\r\ntangible property rights. Partly because of those differences,\r\nJefferson, like most of his successors in the United States,\r\ndoes not see intellectual property as a claim of natural right\r\nbased on expended labor. Instead it is a temporary state-created\r\nmonopoly given to encourage further innovation.\r\n*  Second, there is no \"entitlement\" to have an intellectual\r\nproperty right. Such rights may or may not be given as a matter\r\nof social \"will and convenience\" without \"claim or complaint\r\nfrom any body.\"\r\n*  Third, intellectual property rights are not and should not be\r\npermanent; in fact they should be tightly limited in time and\r\nshould not last a day longer than necessary to encourage the\r\ninnovation in the first place.\r\n*  Fourth, a linked point, they have considerable monopolistic\r\ndangers--they may well produce more \"embarrassment than\r\nadvantage.\" In fact, since intellectual property rights\r\npotentially restrain the benevolent tendency of \"ideas . . .\r\n[to] freely spread from one to another over the globe, for the\r\nmoral and mutual instruction of man,\" they may in some cases\r\nactually hinder rather than encourage innovation.\r\n*  Fifth, deciding whether to have an intellectual property\r\nsystem is only the first choice in a long series.13 Even if one\r\nbelieves that intellectual property is a good idea, which I\r\nfirmly do, one will still have the hard job of saying which\r\ntypes of innovation or information are \"worth to the public the\r\nembarrassment\" of an exclusive right, and of drawing the limits\r\nof that right. This line-drawing task turns out to be very\r\ndifficult. Without the cautions that Jefferson gave us it is\r\nimpossible to do it well.\r\n21\r\n\r\nJefferson's message was famously echoed and amplified thirty\r\nyears later in Britain by Thomas Babington Macaulay.14\r\nMacaulay's speeches to the House of Commons in 1841 on the\r\nsubject of copyright term extension still express better than\r\nanything else the position that intellectual property rights are\r\nnecessary evils which must be carefully circumscribed by law. In\r\norder for the supply of valuable books to be maintained, authors\r\n\"must be remunerated for their literary labour. And there are\r\nonly two ways in which they can be remunerated. One of those\r\nways is patronage; the other is copyright.\" Patronage is\r\nrejected out of hand. \"I can conceive no system more fatal to\r\nthe integrity and independence of literary men than one under\r\nwhich they should be taught to look for their daily bread to the\r\nfavour of ministers and nobles.\"15\r\n22\r\n\r\n    We have, then, only one resource left. We must betake\r\nourselves to copyright, be the inconveniences of copyright what\r\nthey may. Those inconveniences, in truth, are neither few nor\r\nsmall. Copyright is monopoly, and produces all the effects which\r\nthe general voice of mankind attributes to monopoly. . . . I\r\nbelieve, Sir, that I may safely take it for granted that the\r\neffect of monopoly generally is to make articles scarce, to make\r\nthem dear, and to make them bad. And I may with equal safety\r\nchallenge my honorable friend to find out any distinction\r\nbetween copyright and other privileges of the same kind; any\r\nreason why a monopoly of books should produce an effect directly\r\nthe reverse of that which was produced by the East India\r\nCompany's monopoly of tea, or by Lord Essex's monopoly of sweet\r\nwines. Thus, then, stands the case. It is good that authors\r\nshould be remunerated; and the least exceptionable way of\r\nremunerating them is by a monopoly. Yet monopoly is an evil. For\r\nthe sake of the good we must submit to the evil; but the evil\r\nought not to last a day longer than is necessary for the purpose\r\nof securing the good.16\r\n23\r\n\r\nNotice that it is the monopolistic quality of intellectual\r\nproperty that really disturbs Macaulay. His was a generation of\r\nthinkers for whom the negative effect of monopolies of any kind\r\n(and state-granted monopolies in particular) was axiomatic. He\r\nbecomes almost contemptuous when one of the supporters of\r\ncopyright extension declared that it was merely \"a theory\" that\r\nmonopoly makes things expensive. Macaulay agrees, tongue in\r\ncheek. \"It is a theory in the same sense in which it is a\r\ntheory, that day and night follow each other, that lead is\r\nheavier than water, that bread nourishes, that arsenic poisons,\r\nthat alcohol intoxicates.\"17\r\n24\r\n\r\nThese words from Jefferson and Macaulay encapsulate an\r\neighteenth- and nineteenth-century free-trade skepticism about\r\nintellectual property, a skepticism that is widely, but not\r\nuniversally, believed to have played an important role in\r\nshaping the history of intellectual property in both the United\r\nStates and the United Kingdom. Certainly the U.S. Supreme Court\r\nhas offered support for that position,18 and, with one\r\nsignificant recent exception,19 historians of intellectual\r\nproperty have agreed.20 Jefferson himself had believed that the\r\nConstitution should have definite limits on both the term and\r\nthe scope of intellectual property rights.21 James Madison\r\nstressed the costs of any intellectual property right and the\r\nneed to limit its term and to allow the government to end the\r\nmonopoly by compulsory purchase if necessary.22 Adam Smith\r\nexpressed similar views. Monopolies that carry on long after\r\nthey were needed to encourage some socially beneficial activity,\r\nhe said, tax every other citizen \"very absurdly in two different\r\nways: first, by the high price of goods, which, in the case of a\r\nfree trade, they could buy much cheaper; and, secondly, by their\r\ntotal exclusion from a branch of business which it might be both\r\nconvenient and profitable for many of them to carry on.\"23\r\n25\r\n\r\nIt is important to note, though, that the eighteenth- and\r\nnineteenth-century writers I have quoted were not against\r\nintellectual property. All of them--Jefferson, Madison, Smith,\r\nand Macaulay--could see good reason why intellectual property\r\nrights should be granted. They simply insisted on weighing the\r\ncosts and benefits of a new right, each expansion of scope, each\r\nlengthening of the copyright term. Here is Macaulay again,\r\nwaxing eloquently sarcastic about the costs and benefits of\r\nextending the copyright term so that it would last many years\r\nafter the author's death:\r\n26\r\n\r\n    I will take an example. Dr. Johnson died fifty-six years\r\nago. If the law were what my honourable and learned friend\r\nwishes to make it, somebody would now have the monopoly of Dr.\r\nJohnson's works. Who that somebody would be it is impossible to\r\nsay; but we may venture to guess. I guess, then, that it would\r\nhave been some bookseller, who was the assign of another\r\nbookseller, who was the grandson of a third bookseller, who had\r\nbought the copyright from Black Frank, the Doctor's servant and\r\nresiduary legatee, in 1785 or 1786. Now, would the knowledge\r\nthat this copyright would exist in 1841 have been a source of\r\ngratification to Johnson? Would it have stimulated his\r\nexertions? Would it have once drawn him out of his bed before\r\nnoon? Would it have once cheered him under a fit of the spleen?\r\nWould it have induced him to give us one more allegory, one more\r\nlife of a poet, one more imitation of Juvenal? I firmly believe\r\nnot. I firmly believe that a hundred years ago, when he was\r\nwriting our debates for the Gentleman's Magazine, he would very\r\nmuch rather have had twopence to buy a plate of shin of beef at\r\na cook's shop underground.24\r\n27\r\n\r\nAgain, I am struck by how seamlessly Macaulay coupled beautiful,\r\nevocative writing and careful, analytic argument. Admittedly, he\r\nwas remarkable even in his own time, but it is hard to imagine a\r\ncontemporary speechwriter, let alone a politician, coming up\r\nwith Dr. Johnson \"cheered . . . under a fit of the spleen\" or\r\nbuying a \"plate of shin of beef at a cook's shop underground.\"\r\nAlmost as hard as it is to imagine any of them engaging in\r\nJefferson's correspondence about mammoth bones, orthography, and\r\nthe practicalities of the nautical torpedo. But I digress.\r\n28\r\n\r\nMacaulay is not against using a lengthened copyright term to\r\ngive an extra reward to writers, even if this would dramatically\r\nraise the price of books. What he objects to is dramatically\r\nraising the price of books written by long-dead authors in a way\r\nthat benefits the authors hardly at all.\r\n29\r\n\r\n    Considered as a reward to him, the difference between a\r\ntwenty years' and a sixty years' term of posthumous copyright\r\nwould have been nothing or next to nothing. But is the\r\ndifference nothing to us? I can buy Rasselas for sixpence; I\r\nmight have had to give five shillings for it. I can buy the\r\nDictionary, the entire genuine Dictionary, for two guineas,\r\nperhaps for less; I might have had to give five or six guineas\r\nfor it. Do I grudge this to a man like Dr. Johnson? Not at all.\r\nShow me that the prospect of this boon roused him to any\r\nvigorous effort, or sustained his spirits under depressing\r\ncircumstances, and I am quite willing to pay the price of such\r\nan object, heavy as that price is. But what I do complain of is\r\nthat my circumstances are to be worse, and Johnson's none the\r\nbetter; that I am to give five pounds for what to him was not\r\nworth a farthing.25\r\n30\r\n\r\nThough Macaulay won the debate over copyright term extension, it\r\nis worth noting here that his opponents triumphed in the end. As\r\nI pointed out in the last chapter, the copyright term in most of\r\nEurope and in the United States now lasts for the life of the\r\nauthor and an additional seventy years afterward, ten years more\r\nthan the proposal which made Macaulay so indignant. In the\r\nUnited States, corporate owners of \"works-for-hire\" get ninety-\r\nfive years.26 The Supreme Court recently heard a constitutional\r\nchallenge to the law which expanded the term of copyrights by\r\ntwenty years to reach this remarkable length.27 (Full\r\ndisclosure: I helped prepare an amicus brief in that case.)28\r\nThis law, the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, also\r\nextended existing copyrights over works which had already been\r\ncreated.29 As I observed earlier, this is particularly\r\nremarkable if the idea is to give an incentive to create.\r\nObviously the authors of existing works were given sufficient\r\nincentive to create; we know that because they did. Why do we\r\nneed to give the people who now hold their copyrights another\r\ntwenty years of monopoly? This is all cost and no benefit.\r\nMacaulay would have been furious.\r\n31\r\n\r\nWhen the Supreme Court heard the case, it was presented with a\r\nremarkable friend-of-the-court brief from seventeen economists,\r\nseveral of them Nobel laureates.30 The economists made exactly\r\nMacaulay's argument, though in less graceful language. They\r\npointed out that copyright extension imposed enormous costs on\r\nthe public and yet conveyed tiny advantages, if any, to the\r\ncreator. Such an extension, particularly over works that had\r\nalready been written, hardly fit the limits of Congress's power\r\nunder the Constitution \"to promote the Progress of Science and\r\nuseful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and\r\nInventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and\r\nDiscoveries.\"31 Macaulay doubted that these enormously long\r\nterms would encourage the living. Surely they would do little to\r\nencourage the dead, while imposing considerable costs of access\r\non the living? Thus they could hardly be said to \"promote the\r\nprogress\" of knowledge as the Constitution requires. The Court\r\nwas unmoved by this and other arguments. It upheld the law. I\r\nwill return to its decision at the end of the book.\r\n32\r\n\r\nThe intellectual property skeptics had other concerns. Macaulay\r\nwas particularly worried about the power that went with a\r\ntransferable and inheritable monopoly. It is not only that the\r\neffect of monopoly is \"to make articles scarce, to make them\r\ndear, and to make them bad.\" Macaulay also pointed out that\r\nthose who controlled the monopoly, particularly after the death\r\nof the original author, might be given too great a control over\r\nour collective culture. Censorious heirs or purchasers of the\r\ncopyright might prevent the reprinting of a great work because\r\nthey disagreed with its morals.32 We might lose the works of\r\nFielding or Gibbon, because a legatee found them distasteful and\r\nused the power of the copyright to suppress them. This is no\r\nmere fantasy, Macaulay tells us. After praising the novels of\r\nSamuel Richardson in terms that, to modern eyes, seem a little\r\nfervid (\"No writings, those of Shakespeare excepted, show more\r\nprofound knowledge of the human heart\"), Macaulay recounts the\r\nstory of Richardson's grandson, \"a clergyman in the city of\r\nLondon.\" Though a \"most upright and excellent man,\" the grandson\r\n\"had conceived a strong prejudice against works of fiction,\"\r\n\"thought all novel-reading not only frivolous but sinful,\" and\r\n\"had never thought it right to read one of his grandfather's\r\nbooks.\"33 Extended copyright terms might hand over the copyright\r\nto such a man. The public would lose, not because they had to\r\npay exorbitant prices that denied some access to the work, but\r\nbecause the work would be altogether suppressed. Richardson's\r\nnovels--Pamela, Clarissa Harlowe, and so on--are now the preserve\r\nof the classroom rather than the drawing room, so this might not\r\nseem like much of a loss. But Macaulay's next example is not so\r\neasy to dismiss.\r\n33\r\n\r\n    One of the most instructive, interesting, and delightful\r\nbooks in our language is Boswell's Life of Johnson. Now it is\r\nwell known that Boswell's eldest son considered this book,\r\nconsidered the whole relation of Boswell to Johnson, as a blot\r\nin the escutcheon of the family. He thought, not perhaps\r\naltogether without reason, that his father had exhibited himself\r\nin a ludicrous and degrading light. And thus he became so sore\r\nand irritable that at last he could not bear to hear the Life of\r\nJohnson mentioned. Suppose that the law had been what my\r\nhonourable and learned friend wishes to make it. Suppose that\r\nthe copyright of Boswell's Life of Johnson had belonged, as it\r\nwell might, during sixty years, to Boswell's eldest son. What\r\nwould have been the consequence? An unadulterated copy of the\r\nfinest biographical work in the world would have been as scarce\r\nas the first edition of Camden's Britannia.34\r\n34\r\n\r\nFrom more recent examples we can see that outright suppression\r\nis not the only thing to fear. The authors' heirs, or the\r\ncorporations which have purchased their rights, may keep\r\npolicing the boundaries of the work long after the original\r\nauthor is dead. In 2001, Alice Randall published The Wind Done\r\nGone. As its title might indicate, The Wind Done Gone was a 220-\r\npage \"critique of and reaction to\" the world of Gone With the\r\nWind by Margaret Mitchell.35 Most crucially, perhaps, it was a\r\nversion of Gone With the Wind told from the slaves' point of\r\nview. Suddenly the actions of Rhett (\"R\"), Scarlett (\"Other\"),\r\nand an obviously gay Ashley (\"Dreamy Gentleman\") come into new\r\nperspective through the eyes of Scarlett's \"mulatto\" half-\r\nsister. Mitchell's estate wanted to prevent publication of the\r\nbook. At first they were successful.36 As Yochai Benkler puts\r\nit,\r\n35\r\n\r\n    Alice Randall, an African American woman, was ordered by a\r\ngovernment official not to publish her criticism of the\r\nromanticization of the Old South, at least not in the words she wanted\r\nto use. The official was not one of the many in Congress and the\r\nAdministration who share the romantic view of the Confederacy. It was\r\na federal judge in Atlanta who told Randall that she could not write\r\nher critique in the words she wanted to use--a judge enforcing\r\ncopyright law.37\r\n36\r\n\r\n\"They killed Miss Scarlett!\" the astonished trial judge said\r\nafter reading Randall's book. My colleague Jennifer Jenkins, one\r\nof the lawyers in the case, recounts that the judge saw the case\r\nin relentlessly physical terms, seeing the parody as a\r\n\"bulldozer\" and Gone With the Wind as a walled country estate\r\ninto which the bulldozer had violently trespassed. He was\r\nconsequently unimpressed with the claim that this \"bulldozer\"\r\nwas protected by the First Amendment. Eventually, the court of\r\nappeals overturned the district court's judgment.38 Fifty-two\r\nyears after Margaret Mitchell's death, it was a hotly debated\r\npoint how much leeway copyright gave to others to comment upon,\r\ncritique, embellish upon, and parody the cultural icon she had\r\nconjured up.\r\n37\r\n\r\nA NATURAL RIGHT?\r\n38\r\n\r\nTo some people, my argument so far--and Jefferson's and\r\nMacaulay's--will seem to miss the point. They see intellectual\r\nproperty rights not as an incentive, a method of encouraging the\r\nproduction and distribution of innovation, but as a natural or\r\nmoral right. My book is mine because I wrote it, not because\r\nsociety or the law gives me some period of exclusivity over\r\nallowing the copying of its contents. My invention is mine\r\nbecause it came from my brain, not because the law declares a\r\ntwenty-year monopoly over its production or distribution. My\r\nlogo is mine because I worked hard on it, not because the state\r\ngrants me a trademark in order to lower search costs and prevent\r\nconsumer confusion. One answer is simply to say \"In the United\r\nStates, the framers of the Constitution, the legislature, and\r\nthe courts have chosen to arrange things otherwise. In\r\ncopyright, patent, and trademark law--despite occasional\r\ndeviations--they have embraced the utilitarian view instead.\"\r\n39\r\n\r\nBroadly speaking, that answer is correct.39 It also holds, to a\r\nlesser extent, in Britain. Even in the droits d'auteur\r\ncountries, which have a markedly different copyright law regime,\r\nit largely holds for their patent and trademark law systems, and\r\nutilitarian strands suffuse even \"the sacred rights of authors.\"\r\nSo, on a national level, we have rejected or dramatically\r\nlimited the natural rights view, and on an international level,\r\nwe have rejected it in \"industrial property\"--patent and\r\ntrademark--and modified it in copyright.\r\n40\r\n\r\nI think this answer is correct and important, but we have an\r\nobligation to go further. Partly that is because intuitions\r\nabout ownership coming naturally with labor or discovery\r\ncontinue to influence the law. Partly it is because those moral\r\nintuitions are important and appealing. Partly it is because we\r\nmight wish to modify or criticize our current system. Using the\r\nviews of the framers, or current law, to preempt discussion is\r\nunsatisfactory--even though those views are of particular\r\nimportance for the legal policy decisions we face in the short\r\nrun, the issues on which much of my argument is concentrated.\r\n41\r\n\r\nThere are varying stated grounds for natural or moral rights in\r\nintellectual creations. Some people may think the book is mine\r\nbecause I worked on it--a Lockean conception where I mix my sweat\r\nwith these words and receive a property right in the process.\r\n42\r\n\r\nFor all its attractions, there are considerable difficulties\r\nwith such a view. Even within the world of tangible property,\r\nLocke's theory is more complicated than a simple equation of\r\nlabor with property right. Jefferson's account of property is\r\nactually closer to Locke's than many would realize. When\r\nJefferson points out the difficulty in justifying a natural\r\nright even in an acre of land, let alone a book, his premises\r\nare not radically different from Locke's. The same is true when\r\nJefferson says that \"[s]table ownership is the gift of social\r\nlaw, and is given late in the progress of society.\" Even if\r\nnatural right does create the ground for the property claim, it\r\nis \"social law\" that shapes its contours and guarantees its\r\nstability. Jefferson, of course, thought that was particularly\r\ntrue for intellectual property rights. In that context, he felt\r\nthe natural rights argument was much weaker and the need for\r\nsocially defined purposive contours and limitations stronger.\r\n43\r\n\r\nLocke's own views on what we would think of as copyright are\r\nhard to determine. We do know that he had a strong antipathy to\r\nmonopolies--particularly those affecting expression. He believed,\r\nfor example, that giving publishers monopolies over great public\r\ndomain books caused a disastrous fall in quality. Instead, he\r\nargued, such books should be open for all to compete to produce\r\nthe best edition. Of course, he was writing in the context of\r\nmonopolistic printing privileges--to which he was strongly\r\nopposed--rather than of individual authorial rights. Yet he went\r\nfurther and suggested that even for contemporary works, after a\r\nparticular time in print--say fifty years--books could be printed\r\nby anyone.\r\n44\r\n\r\n    I demand whether, if another act for printing should be\r\nmade, it be not reasonable that nobody should have any peculiar\r\nright in any book which has been in print fifty years, but any\r\none as well as another might have liberty to print it: for by\r\nsuch titles as these, which lie dormant, and hinder others, many\r\ngood books come quite to be lost.40\r\n45\r\n\r\nThis sounds like a strongly utilitarian argument, rather than\r\none based on labor and natural right. Of course, we are not\r\nbound by what Locke or Jefferson thought. Still it is striking\r\nto see the turn to a utilitarian conception from both of them.\r\n46\r\n\r\nThe Lockean tradition is not the only one, of course. Others\r\nbelieve that the property right stems from the unique\r\npersonality of each individual--the configurations of your\r\nindividual genius made manifest in the lines of your sonnet.\r\n(Some limit the natural right to literary and expressive work;\r\ncan a mousetrap or a drug molecule express the riddle and wonder\r\nof the human spirit?) Whatever their moral basis or their ambit,\r\nthe common ground between these positions is the belief in a\r\nrationale for intellectual property rights beyond the\r\nutilitarian concerns of Jefferson or Macaulay.\r\n47\r\n\r\nThe norms embodied in the moral rights or natural rights\r\ntradition are deeply attractive--at least to me. Many of us feel\r\na special connection to our expressive creations--even the humble\r\nones such as a term paper or a birthday poem. It is one of the\r\nreasons that the central moral rights in the French droits\r\nd'auteur, or author's rights, tradition resonate so strongly\r\nwith us. The entitlement of an author to be correctly\r\nattributed, to have some control over the integrity of his work,\r\nseems important regardless of its utilitarian functions.1\r\n48\r\n\r\nYet even as we find this claim attractive, we become aware of\r\nthe need to find limiting principles to it. It gives us pause to\r\nthink that Margaret Mitchell or her heirs could forbid someone\r\nparodying her work. Are there no free-speech limitations? When\r\nother forms of authorship, such as computer programs, are\r\nbrought into copyright's domain, does the power of the moral\r\nright decrease, while the need to limit its scope intensifies?\r\n49\r\n\r\nThen there is the question of length. How long is a natural\r\nright in expression or invention supposed to last? It seems\r\nabsurd to imagine that Shakespeare's or Mozart's heirs, or those\r\nwho had bought their copyrights, would still be controlling the\r\nperformance, reproduction, and interpretation of their works\r\nhundreds of years after their death. If the rights are truly\r\nformed for a nonutilitarian purpose, after all, why should they\r\nexpire? The person who first acquires property rights in land by\r\nwork or conquest passes those rights down to heirs and buyers\r\nwith the chain of transmission reaching to the present day.\r\nShould copyright follow suit? Even in France, the home of the\r\nstrongest form of the droits d'auteur and of the \"moral rights\"\r\ntradition, the answer to this question was in the negative.\r\n50\r\n\r\nWe owe a large part of the literary moral rights tradition to\r\nthe immediate aftermath of the French Revolution. In France\r\nbefore the Revolution, as in England before the Statute of Anne,\r\nthe first true copyright legislation, the regulation of\r\npublishing was through a set of \"privileges\" given to printers,\r\nnot rights given to authors. Publishers would have a guild-\r\nenforced monopoly over certain titles. Their right was against\r\ncompeting publishers printing the list of titles over which they\r\nhad the privilege. The Revolution abolished these privileges\r\nand, at first, put nothing in their place. On the other hand, as\r\nCarla Hesse's fascinating work reveals, there was intermittent\r\ninterference by the Prefecture of Police with those who copied\r\nmost flagrantly. One such publisher was sternly instructed by\r\nthe police in these terms:\r\n51\r\n\r\n    [A]ccording to the Declaration of the Rights of Man, liberty\r\nmeans only the freedom to do what does not harm others; and that\r\nit harms others to appropriate the work of an author, because it\r\nis an infringement of the sacred right of property; and that\r\nsuch an enterprise, if it were to remain unpunished, would\r\ndeprive citizens of the instruction they await from celebrated\r\nauthors like M. Bernardin de St. Pierre, because no author would\r\nwant to consecrate his labors to the instruction of his age if\r\npiracy were ever authorized.41\r\n52\r\n\r\nNote the interesting mixture of the language of the \"sacred\r\nrights of property\" and the strong utilitarian justification\r\nwhich cites effects on future literary production and the\r\n\"instruction\" of citizens.\r\n53\r\n\r\nMore expansive conceptions of the rights of authors and,\r\nparticularly, of publishers were also offered. Even before the\r\nRevolution, publishers had been making the arguments that their\r\nprivileges were a form of property rights and had the very good\r\nsense to hire the young Diderot to make those arguments. Hesse\r\nquotes his words:\r\n54\r\n\r\n    What form of wealth could belong to a man, if not a work of\r\nthe mind, . . . if not his own thoughts, . . . the most precious\r\npart of himself, that will never perish, that will immortalize\r\nhim? What comparison could there be between a man, the very\r\nsubstance of man, his soul, and a field, a tree, a vine, that\r\nnature has offered in the beginning equally to all, and that an\r\nindividual has only appropriated through cultivating it?42\r\n55\r\n\r\nDiderot's theme is that authors' rights should actually be\r\nstronger than other property rights for two reasons. First, they\r\nrelate to the very essence of the person, the most \"precious\r\npart of himself.\" Second, they are the only property rights over\r\nsomething that has been added to the existing store of wealth\r\nrather than taken from it. Authorial property, unlike property\r\nin land, adds to the common store rather than detracting from\r\nit. Locke believed that a just assertion of property rights must\r\nleave \"enough and as good\" for others in the society. What could\r\nbetter satisfy this condition than a property right over a novel\r\nthat did not exist before I wrote it? One hundred years later\r\nVictor Hugo echoed the same thoughts in a speech to the Conseil\r\nd'Etat and pointed out at the same time that literary property\r\nrights could potentially \"reconcile\" troublesome authors to\r\nsociety and state.\r\n56\r\n\r\n    You feel the importance and necessity of defending property\r\ntoday. Well, begin by recognising the first and most sacred of\r\nall properties, the one which is neither a transmission nor an\r\nacquisition but a creation, namely literary property . . .\r\nreconcile the artists with society by means of property.43\r\n57\r\n\r\nDiderot wanted perpetual copyrights for authors and, agreeably\r\nto his employers, a correspondingly perpetual printing\r\nprivilege. If the author's heirs could not be traced, the\r\ncopyright would devolve to the current publisher.\r\n58\r\n\r\nBut as Hesse points out, there was another view of literary\r\nproperty--a much more skeptical one put forward best by\r\nCondorcet. This view is also an influential part of the heritage\r\nof the droits d'auteur, even if it is downplayed in its\r\ncontemporary rhetoric. Condorcet began by framing the question\r\nof literary property as one of political liberty. \"Does a man\r\nhave the right to forbid another man to write the same words\r\nthat he himself wrote first? That is the question to resolve.\"44\r\nLike Jefferson, Condorcet is utterly unconvinced that property\r\nrights in a book can be compared to those in a field or a piece\r\nof furniture which can be occupied or used by only one man. The\r\ntype of property is \"based on the nature of the thing.\" He\r\nconcluded, again in language strikingly similar to Jefferson's\r\nand Macaulay's, that literary property was not a real property\r\nright but a privilege, and one which must be assessed on a\r\nutilitarian basis in terms of its contribution to\r\nenlightenment.45\r\n59\r\n\r\n    Any privilege therefore imposes a hindrance on freedom,\r\nplacing a restriction on the rights of other citizens; As such\r\nit is not only harmful to the rights of others who want to copy,\r\nbut the rights of all those who want copies, and that which\r\nincreases the price is an injustice. Does the public interest\r\nrequire that men make this sacrifice? That is the question that\r\nmust be considered; In other words, are [literary] privileges\r\nneeded and useful or harmful to the progress of enlightenment?46\r\n60\r\n\r\nCondorcet's conclusion was that they were not necessary and that\r\nthey could be harmful. \"The books that most furthered the\r\nprogress of enlightenment, the Encyclopédie, the works of\r\nMontesquieu, Voltaire, Rousseau, have not enjoyed the benefits\r\nof a privilege.\" Instead he seemed to favor a combination of\r\n\"subscriptions\" to authors with a trademark-like protection\r\nwhich allowed an author to identify a particular edition of his\r\nwork as the genuine one, but which also allowed competing\r\neditions to circulate freely. In such a market, he believed that\r\nthe price of the competing editions would fall to \"natural\"\r\nlevels--today we would call it marginal cost--but the original\r\nauthor would still be able to charge a modest premium for the\r\nedition he authorized or certified because readers would prefer\r\nit as both more accurate and more authentic. One possible\r\nanalogy is to the history of the fashion industry in the United\r\nStates. It operates largely without design protection but relies\r\nheavily on the trademarks accorded to favored designers and\r\nbrands. There are \"knockoffs\" of Armani or Balenciaga, but the\r\nwealthy still pay an enormous premium for the real thing.\r\n61\r\n\r\nCondorcet also insisted that whatever protection was accorded to\r\nliterary works must not extend to the ideas within them. It is\r\nthe truths within books that make them \"useful\"--a word that does\r\nnot have the same luminance and importance for us today as it\r\ndid for the philosophers of the Enlightenment or the French\r\nRevolution. He argued that any privilege given the author could\r\nnot extend to \"preventing another man from exhibiting the same\r\ntruths, in perfectly the same order, from the same evidence\" or\r\nfrom extending those arguments and developing their\r\nconsequences. In a line that Hesse rightly highlights, he\r\ndeclares that any privileges do not extend over facts or ideas.\r\n\"Ce n'est pas pour les choses, les idées; c'est pour les mots,\r\npour le nom de l'auteur.\"\r\n62\r\n\r\nIn sum, Condorcet favors a limited privilege, circumscribed by\r\nan inquiry into its effects in promoting progress and\r\nenlightenment. The privilege only applies to expression and to\r\n\"the author's name,\" rather than to facts and ideas. This is\r\nvery much within the tradition of Jefferson and Macaulay.\r\n63\r\n\r\nHesse argues, correctly I think, that two warring ideas\r\nshaped--or are at least useful ways of understanding--the\r\ndevelopment of the droits d'auteur tradition. On one side were\r\nDiderot and the publishers promoting an expansive and perpetual\r\nnatural authorial right, which nevertheless was supposed to vest\r\nsuspiciously easily in publishers. On the other was Condorcet,\r\nlooking skeptically at authorial privileges as merely one type\r\nof state interference with free markets and the free circulation\r\nof books and ideas. In place of Diderot's perpetual natural\r\nright, Condorcet sketched out a regime that encourages\r\nproduction and distribution by granting the minimum rights\r\nnecessary for progress.\r\n64\r\n\r\nDifferent as they are, these two sides share a common ground.\r\nThey both focus, though for different reasons, on\r\n\"expression\"--the imprimatur of the author's unique human spirit\r\non the ideas and facts that he or she transmits. It is this\r\n\"original expression\" that modern copyright and the modern\r\ndroits d'auteur actually cover. In today's copyright law, the\r\nfacts and ideas in an author's work proceed immediately into the\r\npublic domain. In other work, I have argued that by confining\r\nthe property right tightly to the \"original expression\" stemming\r\nfrom the unique personality of an individual author the law\r\nseems to accomplish a number of things simultaneously. It\r\nprovides\r\n65\r\n\r\n    a conceptual basis for partial, limited property rights,\r\nwithout completely collapsing the notion of property into the\r\nidea of a temporary, limited, utilitarian state grant, revocable\r\nat will. [At the same time it offers] a moral and philosophical\r\njustification for fencing in the commons, giving the author\r\nproperty in something built from the resources of the public\r\ndomain--language, culture, genre, scientific community, or what\r\nhave you. If one makes originality of spirit the assumed feature\r\nof authorship and the touchstone for property rights, one can\r\nsee the author as creating something entirely new--not\r\nrecombining the resources of the commons.47\r\n66\r\n\r\nThat is an account of the romantic theory of authorship in the\r\ncontext of contemporary Anglo-American copyright law. But when\r\none looks at the history of the French droits d'auteur\r\ntradition, it is striking how well those words describe that\r\nsystem as well. When the French legislature finally produced a\r\nlaw of authors' rights it turned out, in Hesse's words, to\r\nreflect \"an epistemologically impure and unstable legal\r\nsynthesis that combined an instrumentalist notion of the public\r\ngood with a theory of authorship based on natural rights.\"\r\n67\r\n\r\n    Although it drew on a Diderotist rhetoric of the sanctity of\r\nindividual creativity as an inviolable right, it did not\r\nrigorously respect the conclusions Diderot drew from this\r\nposition. In contrast to the privilège d'auteur of 1777, the law\r\ndid not recognize the author's claim beyond his lifetime but\r\nconsecrated the notion, advanced first by Pierre Manuel to\r\ndefend his edition of Mirabeau, that the only true heir to an\r\nauthor's work was the nation as a whole. This notion of a public\r\ndomain, of democratic access to a common cultural inheritance on\r\nwhich no particular claim could be made, bore the traces not of\r\nDiderot, but of Condorcet's faith that truths were given in\r\nnature and, although mediated through individual minds, belonged\r\nultimately to all. Progress in human understanding depended not\r\non private knowledge claims, but on free and equal access to\r\nenlightenment. An author's property rights were conceived as\r\nrecompense for his service as an agent of enlightenment through\r\npublication of his ideas. The law of 1793 accomplished this task\r\nof synthesis through political negotiation rather than\r\nphilosophical reasoning--that is, by refashioning the political\r\nidentity of the author in the first few years of the Revolution\r\nfrom a privileged creature of the absolutist police state into a\r\nservant of public enlightenment.48\r\n68\r\n\r\nHesse argues that this instability would continue through the\r\nrevolutionary period. I agree; indeed I would argue that it does\r\nso to the present day. Why? The answer is simple. The moral\r\nrights view simply proved too much. Without a limiting\r\nprinciple--of time, or scope, or effect--it seemed to presage a\r\nperpetual and expansive control of expressive creations, and\r\nperhaps of inventions. Our intuition that this is a bad idea\r\ncomes from our intuitive understanding that \"Poetry can only be\r\nmade out of other poems; novels out of other novels. All of this\r\nwas much clearer before the assimilation of literature to\r\nprivate enterprise.\"49\r\n69\r\n\r\nThis is the flip side of the arguments that Diderot and later\r\nHugo put forward. Perhaps the romantic author does not create\r\nout of thin air. Perhaps he or she is deeply embedded in a\r\nliterary, musical, cultural, or scientific tradition that would\r\nnot flourish if treated as a set of permanently walled private\r\nplots. Even within the tradition, we see a recognition that the\r\ncontinuing progress of enlightenment and the ssacred genius of\r\nauthors might both require a certain level of freedom in\r\nknowledge inputs and a certain level of control over knowledge\r\noutputs. We see also the recognition that these two requirements\r\nare in fundamental tension. When it comes to reconciling that\r\ntension we must turn in part to utilitarian effects. In short,\r\nwe should pay attention to Jefferson and Macaulay and Condorcet,\r\nnot just because their thoughts shaped the legal and\r\nphilosophical traditions in which we now work--though that is\r\nparticularly true in the case of the United States--but because\r\nthey were right, or at least more right than the alternative.\r\n70\r\n\r\nOf course, we could build a culture around a notion of natural,\r\nabsolute, and permanent rights to invention and expression. It\r\nis not a world many of us would want to live in. There are\r\nexceptions of course. In a recent New York Times op-ed, Mark\r\nHelprin--author of Winter's Tale--argued that intellectual\r\nproperty should become perpetual.50 After all, rights in real\r\nestate or personal property do not expire--though their owners\r\nmight. Why is it that copyrights should \"only\" last for a\r\nlifetime plus seventy additional years, or patents for a mere\r\ntwenty? Mr. Helprin expresses respect for the genius of the\r\nframers, but is unmoved by their firm command that rights be\r\ngranted only for \"limited times.\" He concludes that it was a\r\nmisunderstanding. Jefferson did not realize that while ideas\r\ncannot be owned, their expression can. What's more, the framers\r\nwere misled by their rustic times. \"No one except perhaps\r\nHamilton or Franklin might have imagined that services and\r\nintellectual property would become primary fields of endeavor\r\nand the chief engines of the economy. Now they are, and it is no\r\nmore rational to deny them equal status than it would have been\r\nto confiscate farms, ropewalks and other forms of property in\r\nthe 18th century.\" Poor Jefferson. How lucky we are to have Mr.\r\nHelprin to remedy the consequences of his lack of vision.\r\n71\r\n\r\nOr perhaps not. Think of the way that Jefferson traced the\r\norigins of the mechanical arts used in the elevators and hopper-\r\nboys all the way back to ancient Persia. (In Mr. Helprin's\r\nutopia, presumably, a royalty stream would run to Cyrus the\r\nGreat's engineers.) Jefferson's point was that for the process\r\nof invention to work, we need to confine narrowly the time and\r\nscope of the state-provided monopoly, otherwise further\r\ninventions would become impossible. Each process or part of a\r\nnew invention would risk infringing a myriad of prior patents on\r\nits subcomponents. Innovation would strangle in a thicket of\r\nconflicting monopolies with their roots vanishing back in time.\r\nPresumably the title of Mr. Helprin's excellent novel would\r\nrequire clearance from Shakespeare's heirs.\r\n72\r\n\r\nOf course, one could construct a more modest Lockean idea of\r\nintellectual property51 --building on the notion of \"enough and\r\nas good\" left over for others and drawing the limits tightly\r\nenough to avoid the worst of Mr. Helprin's excesses. But as one\r\nattempts to do this systematically, the power of the\r\nJeffersonian vision becomes all the more apparent--at least as a\r\nstarting place.\r\n73\r\n\r\nThe Jefferson Warning will play an important role in this book.\r\nBut my arguments here have implications far beyond Jefferson's\r\ntime, country, or constitutional tradition. In the last\r\nanalysis, I hope to convince you of the importance of the\r\nJefferson Warning or the views of Macaulay not because they are\r\nfamous authorities and revered thinkers or because they framed\r\nconstitutions or debated legislation. I wish to convince you\r\nthat their views are important because they encapsulate neatly\r\nan important series of truths about intellectual property. We\r\nshould listen to the Jefferson Warning not because it is\r\nprestigious but because of its insight. As the Diderot-Condorcet\r\ndebates point out, the questions on which Jefferson and Macaulay\r\nfocused do not disappear merely because one embraces a\r\nphilosophy of moral rights--if anything, they become more\r\npressing, particularly when one comes to define the limits of\r\nintellectual property in scope and time. I ask that those\r\nreaders who remain leery of the Jeffersonian focus concentrate\r\non that last issue. In an era when we have been expanding\r\nintellectual property rights relentlessly, it is a crucial one.\r\nIf the Jefferson Warning produces in my unconvinced reader even\r\na slight queasiness about the likely effects of such a process\r\nof expansion, it will have done its job--though in fact the\r\ntradition it represented was much richer than a simple\r\nutilitarian series of cautions.\r\n74\r\n\r\nA TRADITION OF SKEPTICAL MINIMALISM\r\n75\r\n\r\nEighteenth- and nineteenth-century intellectual property debates\r\nwent beyond Macaulay's antimonopolist focus on price, access,\r\nquality, and control of the nation's literary heritage. While\r\nMacaulay is the best-remembered English skeptic from the 1840s,\r\nthere were other, more radical skeptics who saw copyright\r\nprimarily as a \"tax on literacy\" or a \"tax on knowledge,\"\r\nidentical in its effects to the newspaper stamp taxes.52 This\r\nwas a time when mass literacy and mass education were the hotly\r\ndebated corollaries to the enlargement of the franchise. The\r\nradical reformers looked with hostility on anything that seemed\r\nlikely to raise the cost of reading and thus continue to\r\nrestrict political and social debate to the wealthier classes.\r\nMacaulay worried about a world in which \"a copy of Clarissa\r\nwould . . . [be] as rare as an Aldus or a Caxton.\"53 His more\r\nradical colleagues saw copyright--to use our ugly jargon rather\r\nthan theirs--as one of the many ways in which state\r\ncommunications policy is set and the communicative landscape\r\ntilted to favor the rich and powerful.54 Macaulay worried about\r\nthe effects of monopoly on literature and culture. All of them\r\nworried about the effects of copyright on democracy, on speech,\r\non education. In the world of the Internet, these skeptics too\r\nhave their contemporary equivalents.\r\n76\r\n\r\nPatent law also attracted its share of attacks in the mid-\r\nnineteenth century. A fusillade of criticism, often delivered by\r\neconomists and cast in the language of free trade, portrayed the\r\npatent system as actively harmful.\r\n77\r\n\r\n    At the annual meeting of the Kongress deutscher Volkswirthe\r\nheld in Dresden, September 1863, the following resolution was\r\nadopted \"by an overwhelming majority\": \"Considering that patents\r\nhinder rather than further the progress of invention; that they\r\nhamper the prompt general utilization of useful inventions; that\r\non balance they cause more harm than benefit to the inventors\r\nthemselves and, thus, are a highly deceptive form of\r\ncompensation; the Congress of German Economists resolves: that\r\npatents of invention are injurious to common welfare.\"55\r\n78\r\n\r\nIn the Netherlands, the patent system was actually abolished in\r\n1869 as a result of such criticisms. Observers in a number of\r\nother countries, including Britain, concluded that their\r\nnational patent systems were doomed. Various proposals were made\r\nto replace patents, with state-provided prizes or bounties to\r\nparticularly useful inventions being the most popular.56\r\n79\r\n\r\nThese snippets are hardly sufficient to constitute any kind of\r\nsurvey of critical reactions to intellectual property systems,\r\nbut I believe that nevertheless they give us some sense of\r\ntypical debates. What do these debates tell us?\r\n80\r\n\r\nFrom the early days of intellectual property as we know it now,\r\nthe main objections raised against it were framed in the\r\nlanguage of free trade and \"anti-monopoly.\" In the United\r\nStates, the founding generation of intellectuals had been\r\nnurtured on the philosophy of the Scottish Enlightenment and the\r\nhistory of the struggle against royal monopolies. They saw the\r\narguments in favor of intellectual property but warned again and\r\nagain of the need to circumscribe both its term and its scope.\r\nThis is the point at the heart of Jefferson's letter. This is\r\nwhy he insisted that we understand the policy implications of\r\nthe differences between tangible property and ideas, which \"like\r\nfire\" are \"expansible over all space, without lessening their\r\ndensity in any point.\"\r\n81\r\n\r\nWhat were the concerns of these early critics? They worried\r\nabout intellectual property producing artificial scarcity, high\r\nprices, and low quality. They insisted that the benefits of each\r\nincremental expansion of intellectual property be weighed\r\nagainst its costs. Think of Macaulay discussing Johnson's\r\npreference for a shin of beef rather than another slice of\r\npostmortem copyright protection. They worried about its justice;\r\ngiven that we all learn from and build on the past, do we have a\r\nright to carve out our own incremental innovations and protect\r\nthem by intellectual property rights?57 Price aside, they also\r\nworried that intellectual property (especially with a lengthy\r\nterm) might give too much control to a single individual or\r\ncorporation over some vital aspect of science and culture. In\r\nmore muted fashion, they discussed the possible effects that\r\nintellectual property might have on future innovation. The most\r\nradical among them worried about intellectual property's effects\r\non political debate, education, and even control of the\r\ncommunications infrastructure, though they did not use that\r\nparticular phrase. But the overwhelming theme was the promotion\r\nof free trade and a corresponding opposition to monopolies.\r\n82\r\n\r\nNow if we were to stop here and simply require that today's\r\npolicy makers, legislators, and judges recite the Jefferson\r\nWarning before they rush off to make new intellectual property\r\nrules for the Internet and the genome, we would have\r\naccomplished a great deal. National and international policy\r\nmakers are keen to set the \"rules of the road for the digital\r\nage.\" If they would momentarily pause their excited millenarian\r\nburbling and read the points scratched out with a quill pen in\r\n1813, or delivered (without PowerPoint support) on the floor of\r\nthe House of Commons in the 1840s, we would be better off.\r\nEveryone is beginning to understand that in the world of the\r\ntwenty-first century the rules of intellectual property are both\r\nvital and contentious. How good it would be then if our debate\r\non intellectual property policy were as vigorous and as informed\r\nas the debates of the nineteenth century. (Though we might hope\r\nit would also be more democratic.)\r\n83\r\n\r\nAnd yet . . . there is much that is missing from the skepticism\r\nof the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and much that remains\r\nunclear. Look at the structure of these comments; they are\r\nframed as criticisms of intellectual property rather than\r\ndefenses of the public domain or the commons, terms that simply\r\ndo not appear in the debates. There is no real discussion of the\r\nworld of intellectual property's outside, its opposite. Most of\r\nthese critics take as their goal the prevention or limitation of\r\nan \"artificial\" monopoly; without this monopoly our goal is to\r\nhave a world of--what? The assumption is that we will return to a\r\nnorm of freedom, but of what kind? Free trade in expression and\r\ninnovation, as opposed to monopoly? Free access to expression\r\nand innovation, as opposed to access for pay? Or free access to\r\ninnovation and expression in the sense of not being subject to\r\nthe right of another person to pick and choose who is given\r\naccess, even if all have to pay some flat fee? Or is it common\r\nownership and control that we seek, including the communal right\r\nto forbid certain kinds of uses of the shared resource? The\r\neighteenth- and nineteenth-century critics brushed over these\r\npoints; but to be fair, we continue to do so today. The opposite\r\nof property, or perhaps we should say the opposites of property,\r\nare much more obscure to us than property itself.\r\n84\r\n\r\nFor the most part, the antimonopolist view of intellectual\r\nproperty makes a simple case. Monopolies are bad. Have as few as\r\npossible and make them as narrow and as short as possible. This\r\nis a fine principle, but it falls short of an affirmative\r\nexplanation and defense of the role of the public domain or the\r\ncommons in enabling creativity, culture, and science. That is a\r\nshame because just as intellectual property is different from\r\ntangible property, so too is its opposite, its outside.\r\n85\r\n\r\nWhat are those opposites? The two major terms in use are \"the\r\npublic domain\" and \"the commons.\" Both are used in multiple\r\nways--probably a good thing. The public domain is material that\r\nis not covered by intellectual property rights. Material might\r\nbe in the public domain because it was never capable of being\r\nowned. Examples would be the English language or the formulae of\r\nNewtonian physics. Alternatively, something might be in the\r\npublic domain because rights have expired. The works of\r\nShakespeare or the patents over powered flight are examples.\r\n86\r\n\r\nSome definitions of the public domain are more granular. They\r\nfocus not only on complete works but on the reserved spaces of\r\nfreedom inside intellectual property. The public domain would\r\ninclude the privilege to excerpt short quotations in a review.\r\nThis vision is messier, but more instructive. If one uses a\r\nspatial metaphor, the absolutist vision is a tessellated map.\r\nAreas of private property are neatly delineated from areas of\r\nthe public domain. Mozart's plot sits next to that of Britney\r\nSpears; one public, the other private. In the granular view, the\r\nmap is more complex. Ms. Spears' plot is cut through with rights\r\nto make fair use, as well as with limitations on ownership of\r\nstandard themes. Instead of the simple tiled map, the granular\r\nvision has private plots with public roads running through them.\r\n87\r\n\r\nIn popular discussion, we tend to use the absolutist view of\r\nboth property and the public domain. Lawyers prefer the more\r\ncomplex view of property and are coming slowly to have a\r\nsimilarly complex view of the public domain. That is the\r\ndefinition I will be using.\r\n88\r\n\r\nThe term \"commons\" is generally used to denote a resource over\r\nwhich some group has access and use rights--albeit perhaps under\r\ncertain conditions. It is used in even more ways than the term\r\n\"public domain.\" The first axis along which definitions of the\r\nterm \"commons\" vary is the size of the group that has access\r\nrights. Some would say it is a commons only if the whole society\r\nhas access. That is the view I will take here.\r\n89\r\n\r\nThe other difference between public domain and commons is the\r\nextent of restrictions on use. Material in the public domain is\r\nfree of property rights. You may do with it what you wish. A\r\ncommons can be restrictive. For example, some open source\r\nsoftware makes your freedom to modify the software contingent on\r\nthe condition that your contributions, too, will be freely open\r\nto others. I will discuss this type of commons in Chapter 8.\r\n90\r\n\r\nSo these are working definitions of public domain and commons.\r\nBut why should we care? Because the public domain is the basis\r\nfor our art, our science, and our self-understanding. It is the\r\nraw material from which we make new inventions and create new\r\ncultural works. Why is it so important? Let us start with the\r\ndry reasons.\r\n91\r\n\r\nInformation and innovation are largely nonrival and\r\nnonexcludable goods. This is Jefferson's point, though expressed\r\nin less graceful language. It has some interesting corollaries.\r\nInformation is hard to value until you have it, but once you\r\nhave it, how can you dispossess yourself of it? The apple can be\r\ntaken back by the merchant if you decide not to buy. The facts\r\nor the formulae cannot. The moment when you might have decided\r\nto pay or not to pay is already over. The great economist\r\nKenneth Arrow formalized this insight about information\r\neconomics,58 and it profoundly shapes intellectual property\r\npolicy. (To a large extent, for example, the requirement of\r\n\"patent disclosure\" attempts to solve this problem. I can read\r\nall about your mousetrap but I am still forbidden from using it.\r\nI can decide whether or not to license your design at that\r\npoint.) But for all the material in the public domain, where no\r\nintellectual property right is necessary, this point is solved\r\nelegantly by having the information be \"free as the air to\r\ncommon use.\" All of us can use the same store of information,\r\ninnovation, and free culture. It will be available at its cost\r\nof reproduction--close to zero--and we can all build upon it\r\nwithout interfering with each other. Think of the English\r\nlanguage, basic business methods, tables of logarithms, the\r\nPythagorean theorem, Shakespeare's insights about human nature,\r\nthe periodic table, Ohm's law, the sonnet form, the musical\r\nscale.\r\n92\r\n\r\nWould you have paid to purchase access to each of these? I might\r\ntell you that English was a superior communication tool--a really\r\ngood command language for your cognitive operating system. There\r\ncould be levels of access with corresponding prices. Would you\r\npay to get access to \"English Professional Edition\"? We can\r\ncertainly imagine such a way of organizing languages. (To some\r\nextent, scribal conventions operated this way. The languages of\r\nthe professions still do. One paid for access to \"law French\" in\r\nthe common law courts of England. One pays for an interpreter of\r\ncontemporary legal jargon in today's legal system. But even\r\nthere the language is free to the autodidact.) We can imagine\r\nlanguage, scientific knowledge, basic algebra, the tonic scale,\r\nor the classics of four-hundred-year-old literature all being\r\navailable only as property. Those who had the highest \"value for\r\nuse\" would purchase them. Those who did not value them\r\nhighly--whether because they could not know what could be built\r\nwith them until they had done so or because they did not have\r\nthe money--would not. What would this world, this culture, this\r\nscience, this market look like?\r\n93\r\n\r\nIt would probably be very inefficient, the economists tell us.\r\nPerfect information is a defining feature of the perfect market.\r\nThe more commodified and restricted our access to information,\r\nthe less efficient the operation of the market, the more poorly\r\nit allocates resources in our society. (The permanent and in\r\nsome sense insoluble tension between the need to provide\r\nincentives to generate information, thus raising its cost, and\r\nthe need to have access to perfect information for efficiency is\r\nthe central feature of our intellectual property policy.)59 When\r\nwe commodify too much we actually undermine creativity, since we\r\nare raising the price of the inputs for future creations--which\r\nmight themselves be covered by intellectual property rights. But\r\n\"inefficient\" is too bloodless a way to describe this world. It\r\nwould be awful.\r\n94\r\n\r\nOur markets, our democracy, our science, our traditions of free\r\nspeech, and our art all depend more heavily on a public domain\r\nof freely available material than they do on the informational\r\nmaterial that is covered by property rights. The public domain\r\nis not some gummy residue left behind when all the good stuff\r\nhas been covered by property law. The public domain is the place\r\nwe quarry the building blocks of our culture. It is, in fact,\r\nthe majority of our culture. Or at least it has been.\r\n95\r\n\r\nI deliberately gave easy examples. It is obvious how unnecessary\r\nbut also how harmful it would be to extend property rights to\r\nlanguage, to facts, to business methods and scientific\r\nalgorithms, to the basic structures of music, to art whose\r\ncreators are long dead. It is obvious that this would not\r\nproduce more innovation, more debate, more art, more democracy.\r\nBut what about the places where the value of the public domain\r\nis not obvious?\r\n96\r\n\r\nWhat if we were actually moving to extend patents to business\r\nmethods, or intellectual property rights to unoriginal\r\ncompilations of facts? What if we had locked up most of\r\ntwentieth-century culture without getting a net benefit in\r\nreturn? What if the basic building blocks of new scientific\r\nfields were being patented long before anything concrete or\r\nuseful could be built from them? What if we were littering our\r\nelectronic communication space with digital barbed wire and\r\nregulating the tiniest fragments of music as if they were stock\r\ncertificates? What if we were doing all this in the blithe\r\nbelief that more property rights mean more innovation? The story\r\nof this book is that we are.\r\n97\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Jefferson Warning is important. It is, however, just a\r\nwarning. While it would be excellent to print it on pocket cards\r\nand hand it to our elected representatives, that alone will not\r\nsolve the most pressing problems we face. In the chapters that\r\nfollow, I shall try to go further. In Chapter 3, I set the\r\nprocess of expansion we are engaged in--our \"second enclosure\r\nmovement\"--in perspective by comparing it to the original\r\nenclosures of the grassy commons of old England. In Chapter 4, I\r\njump from the world of the fifteenth or nineteenth century to\r\nthe world of the twenty-first, from elevators and grain hoppers\r\nto video recorders, the Internet, and file-sharing services. I\r\nuse the story of several key legal disputes to illustrate a\r\nbroader history--the history of intellectual property's struggle\r\nwith communications technologies that allow people to copy more\r\ncheaply. Strangely enough, the Jefferson Warning will be crucial\r\nin understanding the debate over copyright online and, in\r\nparticular, in understanding the fear that drives our current\r\npolicy making, a fear I refer to as the Internet Threat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 3: The Second Enclosure Movement\r\n1\r\n\r\nThe law locks up the man or woman\r\nWho steals the goose from off the common\r\nBut leaves the greater villain loose\r\nWho steals the common from off the goose.\r\n2\r\n\r\nThe law demands that we atone\r\nWhen we take things we do not own\r\nBut leaves the lords and ladies fine\r\nWho take things that are yours and mine.\r\n3\r\n\r\nThe poor and wretched don't escape\r\nIf they conspire the law to break;\r\nThis must be so but they endure\r\nThose who conspire to make the law.\r\n4\r\n\r\nThe law locks up the man or woman\r\nWho steals the goose from off the common\r\nAnd geese will still a common lack\r\nTill they go and steal it back.\r\n[Anon.]1\r\n5\r\n\r\nIn fits and starts from the fifteenth to the nineteenth century,\r\nthe English \"commons\" was \"enclosed.\" 2 Enclosure did not\r\nnecessarily mean physical fencing, though that could happen.\r\nMore likely, the previously common land was simply converted\r\ninto private property, generally controlled by a single\r\nlandholder.\r\n6\r\n\r\nThe poem that begins this chapter is the pithiest condemnation\r\nof the process. It manages in a few lines to criticize double\r\nstandards, expose the controversial nature of property rights,\r\nand take a slap at the legitimacy of state power. And it does\r\nthis all with humor, without jargon, and in rhyming couplets.\r\nAcademics should take note. Like most criticisms of the\r\nenclosure movement, the poem depicts a world of rapacious,\r\nstate-aided \"privatization,\" a conversion into private property\r\nof something that had formerly been common property or perhaps\r\nhad been outside the property system altogether. One kind of\r\n\"stealing\" is legal, says the poet, because the state changes\r\nthe law of property to give the \"lords and ladies\" a right over\r\nan area formerly open to all. But let a commoner steal something\r\nand he is locked up.\r\n7\r\n\r\nThe anonymous author was not alone in feeling indignant. Thomas\r\nMore (one of only two saints to write really good political\r\ntheory) made similar points, though he used sheep rather than\r\ngeese in his argument. Writing in the sixteenth century, he had\r\nargued that enclosure was not merely unjust in itself but\r\nharmful in its consequences: a cause of economic inequality,\r\ncrime, and social dislocation. In a wonderfully bizarre passage\r\nhe argues that sheep are a principal cause of theft. Sheep? Why,\r\nyes.\r\n8\r\n\r\n    [Y]our sheep that were wont to be so meek and tame, and so\r\nsmall eaters, now, as I hear say, be become so great devourers\r\nand so wild, that they eat up, and swallow down the very men\r\nthemselves. They consume, destroy, and devour whole fields,\r\nhouses, and cities.\r\n9\r\n\r\nWho were these sheep? Bizarre Dolly-like clones? Transgenic\r\nkiller rams? No. More meant only that under the economic lure of\r\nthe wool trade, the \"noblemen and gentlemen\" were attempting\r\ntheir own enclosure movement.\r\n10\r\n\r\n    [They] leave no ground for tillage, they enclose all into\r\npastures; they throw down houses; they pluck down towns, and\r\nleave nothing standing, but only the church to be made a sheep-\r\nhouse. . . . Therefore that one covetous and insatiable\r\ncormorant and very plague of his native country may compass\r\nabout and enclose many thousand acres of ground together within\r\none pale or hedge, the husbandmen be thrust out of their own.3\r\n11\r\n\r\nThe sheep devour all. The dispossessed \"husbandmen\" now find\r\nthemselves without land or money and turn instead to theft. In\r\nMore's vision, it is all very simple. Greed leads to enclosure.\r\nEnclosure disrupts the life of the poor farmer. Disruption leads\r\nto crime and violence.\r\n12\r\n\r\nWriting 400 years later, Karl Polanyi echoes More precisely. He\r\ncalls the enclosure movement \"a revolution of the rich against\r\nthe poor\" and goes on to paint it in the most unflattering\r\nlight. \"The lords and nobles were upsetting the social order,\r\nbreaking down ancient law and custom, sometimes by means of\r\nviolence, often by pressure and intimidation. They were\r\nliterally robbing the poor of their share in the common. . . .\"\r\n4 And turning them to \"beggars and thieves.\" The critics of\r\nenclosure saw other harms too, though they are harder to\r\nclassify. They bemoaned the relentless power of market logic to\r\nmigrate to new areas, disrupting traditional social\r\nrelationships and perhaps even views of the self, or the\r\nrelationship of human beings to the environment. Fundamentally,\r\nthey mourned the loss of a form of life.\r\n13\r\n\r\nSo much for the bad side of the enclosure movement. For many\r\neconomic historians, everything I have said up to now is the\r\nworst kind of sentimental bunk, romanticizing a form of life\r\nthat was neither comfortable nor noble, and certainly not very\r\negalitarian. The big point about the enclosure movement is that\r\nit worked; this innovation in property systems allowed an\r\nunparalleled expansion of productive possibilities. 5 By\r\ntransferring inefficiently managed common land into the hands of\r\na single owner, enclosure escaped the aptly named \"tragedy of\r\nthe commons.\" It gave incentives for large-scale investment,\r\nallowed control over exploitation, and in general ensured that\r\nresources could be put to their most efficient use. Before the\r\nenclosure movement, the feudal lord would not invest in drainage\r\nsystems, sheep purchases, or crop rotation that might increase\r\nyields from the common--he knew all too well that the fruits of\r\nhis labor could be appropriated by others. The strong private\r\nproperty rights and single-entity control that were introduced\r\nin the enclosure movement avoid the tragedies of overuse and\r\nunderinvestment: more grain will be grown, more sheep raised,\r\nconsumers will benefit, and fewer people will starve in the long\r\nrun. 6\r\n14\r\n\r\nIf the price of this social gain is a greater concentration of\r\neconomic power, the introduction of market forces into areas\r\nwhere they previously had not been so obvious, or the disruption\r\nof a modus vivendi with the environment--then, enclosure's\r\ndefenders say, so be it! In their view, the agricultural surplus\r\nproduced by enclosure helped to save a society devastated by the\r\nmass deaths of the sixteenth century. Those who weep over the\r\nterrible effects of private property should realize that it\r\nliterally saves lives.\r\n15\r\n\r\nNow it is worth noting that while this view was once\r\nunchallenged, 7 recent scholarship has thrown some doubts on the\r\neffects of enclosure on agricultural production. 8 Some scholars\r\nargue that the commons was actually better run than the\r\ndefenders of enclosure admit. 9 Thus, while enclosure did\r\nproduce the changes in the distribution of wealth that so\r\nincensed an earlier generation of critical historians, they\r\nargue that there are significant questions about whether it led\r\nto greater efficiency or innovation. The pie was carved up\r\ndifferently, but did it get bigger? The debate about these\r\nissues is little known, however, outside the world of economic\r\nhistorians. \"Everyone\" knows that a commons is by definition\r\ntragic and that the logic of enclosure is as true today as it\r\nwas in the fifteenth century. I will not get involved in this\r\ndebate. Assume for the sake of argument that enclosure did\r\nindeed produce a surge in agriculture. Assume, in other words,\r\nthat converting the commons into private property saved lives.\r\nThis is the logic of enclosure. It is a powerful argument, but\r\nit is not always right.\r\n16\r\n\r\nThis is all very well, but what does it have to do with\r\nintellectual property? I hope the answer is obvious. The\r\nargument of this book is that we are in the middle of a second\r\nenclosure movement. While it sounds grandiloquent to call it\r\n\"the enclosure of the intangible commons of the mind,\" in a very\r\nreal sense that is just what it is. 10 True, the new state-\r\ncreated property rights may be \"intellectual\" rather than\r\n\"real,\" but once again things that were formerly thought of as\r\ncommon property, or as \"uncommodifiable,\" or outside the market\r\naltogether, are being covered with new, or newly extended,\r\nproperty rights.\r\n17\r\n\r\nTake the human genome as an example. Again, the supporters of\r\nenclosure have argued that the state was right to step in and\r\nextend the reach of property rights; that only thus could we\r\nguarantee the kind of investment of time, ingenuity, and capital\r\nnecessary to produce new drugs and gene therapies. 11 To the\r\nquestion, \"Should there be patents over human genes?\" the\r\nsupporters of enclosure would answer that private property saves\r\nlives. 12 The opponents of enclosure have claimed that the human\r\ngenome belongs to everyone, that it is literally the common\r\nheritage of humankind, that it should not and perhaps in some\r\nsense cannot be owned, and that the consequences of turning over\r\nthe human genome to private property rights will be dreadful, as\r\nmarket logic invades areas which should be the farthest from the\r\nmarket. In stories about stem cell and gene sequence patents,\r\ncritics have mused darkly about the way in which the state is\r\nhanding over monopoly power to a few individuals and\r\ncorporations, potentially introducing bottlenecks and\r\ncoordination costs that slow down innovation. 13\r\n18\r\n\r\nAlongside these accounts of the beneficiaries of the new\r\nproperty scheme run news stories about those who were not so\r\nfortunate, the commoners of the genetic enclosure. Law students\r\nacross America read Moore v. Regents of University of\r\nCalifornia, a California Supreme Court case deciding that Mr.\r\nMoore had no property interest in the cells derived from his\r\nspleen. 14 The court tells us that giving private property\r\nrights to \"sources\" would slow the freewheeling practice\r\nresearchers have of sharing their cell lines with all and\r\nsundry. 15 The doctors whose inventive genius created a billion-\r\ndollar cell line from Mr. Moore's \"naturally occurring raw\r\nmaterial,\" by contrast, are granted a patent. Private property\r\nrights here, by contrast, are a necessary incentive to research.\r\n16 Economists on both sides of the enclosure debate concentrate\r\non the efficient allocation of rights. Popular discussion, on\r\nthe other hand, doubtless demonstrating a reprehensible lack of\r\nrigor, returns again and again to more naturalistic assumptions\r\nsuch as the essentially \"common\" quality of the property\r\ninvolved or the idea that one owns one's own body. 17\r\n19\r\n\r\nThe genome is not the only area to be partially \"enclosed\"\r\nduring this second enclosure movement. The expansion of\r\nintellectual property rights has been remarkable--from business\r\nmethod patents, to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, to\r\ntrademark \"anti-dilution\" rulings, to the European Database\r\nProtection Directive. 18 The old limits to intellectual property\r\nrights--the antierosion walls around the public domain--are also\r\nunder attack. The annual process of updating my syllabus for a\r\nbasic intellectual property course provides a nice snapshot of\r\nwhat is going on. I can wax nostalgic looking back to a five-\r\nyear-old text, with its confident list of subject matter that\r\nintellectual property rights could not cover, the privileges\r\nthat circumscribed the rights that did exist, and the length of\r\ntime before a work falls into the public domain. In each case,\r\nthe limits have been eaten away.\r\n20\r\n\r\nHOW MUCH OF THE INTANGIBLE COMMONS SHOULD WE ENCLOSE?\r\n21\r\n\r\nSo far I have argued that there are profound similarities\r\nbetween the first enclosure movement and our contemporary\r\nexpansion of intellectual property, which I call the second\r\nenclosure movement. Once again, the critics and proponents of\r\nenclosure are locked in battle, hurling at each other\r\nincommensurable claims about innovation, efficiency, traditional\r\nvalues, the boundaries of the market, the saving of lives, the\r\nloss of familiar liberties. Once again, opposition to enclosure\r\nis portrayed as economically illiterate: the beneficiaries of\r\nenclosure telling us that an expansion of property rights is\r\nneeded in order to fuel progress. Indeed, the post-Cold War\r\n\"Washington consensus\" is invoked to claim that the lesson of\r\nhistory itself is that the only way to get growth and efficiency\r\nis through markets; property rights, surely, are the sine qua\r\nnon of markets. 19\r\n22\r\n\r\nThis faith in enclosure is rooted in a correspondingly deep\r\npessimism about the possibility of managing resources that are\r\neither commonly owned or owned by no one. If all have the right\r\nto graze their herds on common land, what incentive does anyone\r\nhave to hold back? My attempt to safeguard the future of the\r\npasture will simply be undercut by others anxious to get theirs\r\nwhile the getting is good. Soon the pasture will be overgrazed\r\nand all our flocks will go hungry. In a 1968 article, Garrett\r\nHardin came up with the phrase that would become shorthand for\r\nthe idea that there were inherent problems with collectively\r\nmanaged resources: \"the tragedy of the commons.\" 20 The phrase,\r\nmore so than the actual arguments in his article, has come to\r\nexercise considerable power over our policies today. Private\r\nproperty--enclosure--is portrayed as the happy ending for the\r\ntragedy of the commons: when policy makers see a resource that\r\nis unowned, they tend to reach reflexively for \"the solving idea\r\nof property.\" According to this view, enclosure is not a\r\n\"revolution of the rich against the poor,\" it is a revolution to\r\nsave the waste of socially vital resources. To say that some\r\nsocial resource is not owned by an individual, that it is free\r\nas the air to common use, is automatically to conjure up the\r\nidea that it is being wasted.\r\n23\r\n\r\nBut if there are similarities between our two enclosures, there\r\nare also profound dissimilarities; the networked commons of the\r\nmind has many different characteristics from the grassy commons\r\nof Old England. 21 I want to concentrate here on two key\r\ndifferences between the intellectual commons and the commons of\r\nthe first enclosure movement, differences that should lead us to\r\nquestion whether this commons is truly tragic and to ask whether\r\nstronger intellectual property rights really are the solution to\r\nour problems. These differences are well known, indeed they are\r\nthe starting point for most intellectual property law, a\r\nstarting point that Jefferson and Macaulay have already laid out\r\nfor us. Nevertheless, reflection on them might help to explain\r\nboth the problems and the stakes in the current wave of\r\nexpansion.\r\n24\r\n\r\nUnlike the earthy commons, the commons of the mind is generally\r\n\"nonrival.\" Many uses of land are mutually exclusive: if I am\r\nusing the field for grazing, it may interfere with your plans to\r\nuse it for growing crops. By contrast, a gene sequence, an MP3\r\nfile, or an image may be used by multiple parties; my use does\r\nnot interfere with yours. To simplify a complicated analysis,\r\nthis means that the threat of overuse of fields and fisheries is\r\ngenerally not a problem with the informational or innovational\r\ncommons. 22 Thus, one type of tragedy of the commons is avoided.\r\n25\r\n\r\nThe concerns in the informational commons have to do with a\r\ndifferent kind of collective action problem: the problem of\r\nincentives to create the resource in the first place. The\r\ndifficulty comes from the assumption that information goods are\r\nnot only nonrival (uses do not interfere with each other), but\r\nalso nonexcludable (it is impossible, or at least hard, to stop\r\none unit of the good from satisfying an infinite number of users\r\nat zero marginal cost). Pirates will copy the song, the\r\nmousetrap, the drug formula, the brand. The rest of the argument\r\nis well known. Lacking an ability to exclude, creators will be\r\nunable to charge for their creations; there will be inadequate\r\nincentives to create. Thus, the law must step in and create a\r\nlimited monopoly called an intellectual property right.\r\n26\r\n\r\nHow about the argument that the increasing importance of\r\ninformation-intensive products to the world economy means that\r\nprotection must increase? Must the information commons be\r\nenclosed because it is now a more important sector of economic\r\nactivity? 23 This was certainly one of the arguments for the\r\nfirst enclosure movement. For example, during the Napoleonic\r\nWars enclosure was defended as a necessary method of increasing\r\nthe efficiency of agricultural production, now a vital sector of\r\na wartime economy.\r\n27\r\n\r\nHere we come to another big difference between the commons of\r\nthe mind and the earthy commons. As has frequently been pointed\r\nout, information products are often made up of fragments of\r\nother information products; your information output is someone\r\nelse's information input. 24 These inputs may be snippets of\r\ncode, discoveries, prior research, images, genres of work,\r\ncultural references, or databases of single nucleotide\r\npolymorphisms--each is raw material for future innovation. Every\r\nincrease in protection raises the cost of, or reduces access to,\r\nthe raw material from which you might have built those future\r\nproducts. The balance is a delicate one; one Nobel Prize-winning\r\neconomist has claimed that it is actually impossible to strike\r\nthat balance so as to produce an informationally efficient\r\nmarket. 25\r\n28\r\n\r\nWhether or not it is impossible in theory, it is surely a\r\ndifficult problem in practice. In other words, even if enclosure\r\nof the arable commons always produced gains (itself a subject of\r\ndebate), enclosure of the information commons clearly has the\r\npotential to harm innovation as well as to support it. 26 More\r\nproperty rights, even though they supposedly offer greater\r\nincentives, do not necessarily make for more and better\r\nproduction and innovation--sometimes just the opposite is true.\r\nIt may be that intellectual property rights slow down\r\ninnovation, by putting multiple roadblocks in the way of\r\nsubsequent innovation. 27 Using a nice inversion of the idea of\r\nthe tragedy of the commons, Heller and Eisenberg referred to\r\nthese effects--the transaction costs caused by myriad property\r\nrights over the necessary components of some subsequent\r\ninnovation--as \"the tragedy of the anticommons.\" 28\r\n29\r\n\r\nIn short, even if the enclosure movement was a complete success,\r\nthere are important reasons to believe that the intangible world\r\nis less clearly a candidate for enclosure, that we should pause,\r\nstudy the balance between the world of the owned and the world\r\nof the free, gather evidence. After all, even in physical space,\r\n\"common\" property such as roads increases the value of the\r\nsurrounding private tracts. If there are limits to the virtues\r\nof enclosure even there, how much more so in a world of\r\nintangible and nonrival goods, which develop by drawing on prior\r\ncreations? Yet the second enclosure movement proceeds\r\nconfidently nevertheless--with little argument and less evidence.\r\n30\r\n\r\nTo be sure, there is a danger of overstatement. The very fact\r\nthat the changes have been so one-sided makes it hard to resist\r\nexaggerating their impact. In 1918, Justice Brandeis confidently\r\nclaimed that \"[t]he general rule of law is, that the noblest of\r\nhuman productions--knowledge, truths ascertained, conceptions,\r\nand ideas--become, after voluntary communication to others, free\r\nas the air to common use.\" 29 That baseline--intellectual\r\nproperty rights are the exception rather than the norm; ideas\r\nand facts must always remain in the public domain--is still\r\nsupposed to be our starting point. 30 It is, however, under\r\nattack.\r\n31\r\n\r\nBoth overtly and covertly, the commons of facts and ideas is\r\nbeing enclosed. Patents are increasingly stretched to cover\r\n\"ideas\" that twenty years ago all scholars would have agreed\r\nwere unpatentable. 31 Most troubling of all are the attempts to\r\nintroduce intellectual property rights over mere compilations of\r\nfacts. 32 If U.S. intellectual property law had an article of\r\nfaith, it was that unoriginal compilations of facts would remain\r\nin the public domain, that this availability of the raw material\r\nof science and speech was as important to the next generation of\r\ninnovation as the intellectual property rights themselves. 33\r\nThe system would hand out monopolies in inventions and in\r\noriginal expression, while the facts below (and ideas above)\r\nwould remain free for all to build upon. But this premise is\r\nbeing undermined. Some of the challenges are subtle: in patent\r\nlaw, stretched interpretations of novelty and nonobviousness\r\nallow intellectual property rights to move closer and closer to\r\nthe underlying data layer; gene sequence patents come very close\r\nto being rights over a particular discovered arrangement of\r\ndata--C's, G's, A's, and T's. 34 Other challenges are overt: the\r\nEuropean Database Protection Directive did (and various proposed\r\nbills in the United States would) create proprietary rights over\r\ncompilations of facts, often without even the carefully framed\r\nexceptions of the copyright scheme, such as the usefully protean\r\ncategory of fair use.\r\n32\r\n\r\nThe older strategy of intellectual property law was a \"braided\"\r\none: thread a thin layer of intellectual property rights around\r\na commons of material from which future creators would draw. 35\r\nEven that thin layer of intellectual property rights was limited\r\nso as to allow access to the material when that was necessary to\r\nfurther the goals of the system. Fair use allows for parody,\r\ncommentary, and criticism, and also for \"decompilation\" of\r\ncomputer programs so that Microsoft's competitors can reverse\r\nengineer Word's features in order to make sure their program can\r\nconvert Word files. It may sound paradoxical, but in a very real\r\nsense protection of the commons was one of the fundamental goals\r\nof intellectual property law.\r\n33\r\n\r\nIn the new vision of intellectual property, however, property\r\nshould be extended everywhere; more is better. Expanding\r\npatentable and copyrightable subject matter, lengthening the\r\ncopyright term, giving legal protection to \"digital barbed\r\nwire,\" even if it is used to prevent fair use: each of these can\r\nbe understood as a vote of no confidence in the productive\r\npowers of the commons. We seem to be shifting from Brandeis's\r\nassumption that the \"noblest of human productions are free as\r\nthe air to common use\" to the assumption that any commons is\r\ninefficient, if not tragic.\r\n34\r\n\r\nThe expansion is more than a formal one. It used to be\r\nrelatively hard to violate an intellectual property right. The\r\ntechnologies of reproduction or the activities necessary to\r\ninfringe were largely, though not entirely, industrial. Imagine\r\nsomeone walking up to you in 1950, handing you a book or a\r\nrecord or a movie reel, and saying \"Quick! Do something the law\r\nof intellectual property might forbid.\" (This, I admit, is a\r\nscenario only likely to come to the mind of a person in my line\r\nof work.) You would have been hard-pressed to do so. Perhaps you\r\ncould find a balky mimeograph machine, or press a reel-to-reel\r\ntape recorder into use. You might manage a single unauthorized\r\nshowing of the movie--though to how many people? But triggering\r\nthe law of intellectual property would be genuinely difficult.\r\nLike an antitank mine, it would not be triggered by the\r\nfootsteps of individuals. It was reserved for bigger game.\r\n35\r\n\r\nThis was no accident. The law of intellectual property placed\r\nits triggers at the point where commercial activity by\r\ncompetitors could undercut the exploitation of markets by the\r\nrights holder. Copying, performance, distribution--these were\r\nthings done by other industrial entities who were in competition\r\nwith the owner of the rights: other publishers, movie theaters,\r\ndistributors, manufacturers. In practice, if not theory, the law\r\nwas predominantly a form of horizontal industry regulation of\r\nunfair competition--made by the people in the affected industries\r\nfor the people in the affected industries. The latter point is\r\nworth stressing. Congress would, and still does, literally hand\r\nover the lawmaking process to the industries involved, telling\r\nthem to draft their intra-industry contract in the form of a\r\nlaw, and then to return to Congress to have it enacted. The\r\npublic was not at the table, needless to say, and the assumption\r\nwas that to the extent there was a public interest involved in\r\nintellectual property law, it was in making sure that the\r\nindustries involved got their act together, so that the flow of\r\nnew books and drugs and movies would continue. Members of the\r\npublic, in other words, were generally thought of as passive\r\nconsumers of finished products produced under a form of\r\nintraindustry regulation that rarely implicated any act that an\r\nordinary person would want, or be able, to engage in.\r\n36\r\n\r\nIn the world of the 1950s, these assumptions make some\r\nsense--though we might still disagree with the definition of the\r\npublic interest. It was assumed by many that copyright need not\r\nand probably should not regulate private, noncommercial acts.\r\nThe person who lends a book to a friend or takes a chapter into\r\nclass is very different from the company with a printing press\r\nthat chooses to reproduce ten thousand copies and sell them. The\r\nphotocopier and the VCR make that distinction fuzzier, and the\r\nnetworked computer threatens to erase it altogether.\r\n37\r\n\r\nSo how are things different today? If you are a person who\r\nroutinely uses computers, the Internet, or digital media,\r\nimagine a day when you do not create--intentionally and\r\nunintentionally--hundreds of temporary, evanescent copies. (If\r\nyou doubt this, look in the cache of your browser.) Is there a\r\nday when you do not \"distribute\" or retransmit fragments of\r\narticles you have read, when you do not seek to share with\r\nfriends some image or tune? Is there a day when you do not\r\nrework for your job, for your class work, or simply for pastiche\r\nor fun, some of the digital material around you? In a networked\r\nsociety, copying is not only easy, it is a necessary part of\r\ntransmission, storage, caching, and, some would claim, even\r\nreading. 36\r\n38\r\n\r\nAs bioinformatics blurs the line between computer modeling and\r\nbiological research, digital production techniques blur the\r\nlines between listening, editing, and remaking. \"Rip, mix, and\r\nburn,\" says the Apple advertisement. It marks a world in which\r\nthe old regime of intellectual property, operating upstream as a\r\nform of industrial competition policy, has been replaced.\r\nIntellectual property is now in and on the desktop and is\r\nimplicated in routine creative, communicative, and just plain\r\nconsumptive acts that each of us performs every day. Suddenly,\r\nthe triggers of copyright--reproduction, distribution--can be\r\nactivated by individual footsteps.\r\n39\r\n\r\nOf course, we would hope that in your daily actions you\r\nscrupulously observed the rights--all the rights--of the companies\r\nthat have interests in the texts, tunes, images of celebrities,\r\ntrademarks, business method patents, and fragments of computer\r\ncode you dealt with. Did you? Can you be sure? I teach\r\nintellectual property, but I admit to some uncertainty.\r\n40\r\n\r\nI would not have imagined that a temporary image of a Web page\r\ncaptured in the cache of my browser counted as a \"copy\" for the\r\npurposes of copyright law. 37 I would have thought that it was\r\nfair use for a company to photocopy articles in journals it\r\nsubscribed to, and paid for, in order to circulate them to its\r\nresearchers. 38 If a conservative Web site reposted news\r\narticles from liberal newspapers with critical commentary, that,\r\ntoo, would have seemed like fair use. 39 I would have thought\r\nthat it was beneficial competition, and not a trespass, for an\r\nelectronic \"aggregator\" to gather together auction prices or\r\nairline fares, so as to give consumers more choice. 40 I would\r\nnot have thought that a search engine that catalogued and\r\ndisplayed in framed format the digital graphics found on the\r\nInternet would be sued for infringing the copyrights of the\r\nowners of those images. 41 I would not have thought that I might\r\nbe sued for violating intellectual property law if I tried to\r\ncompete with a printer company by making toner cartridges that\r\nwere compatible with its printers. 42\r\n41\r\n\r\nThe examples go on. I know that the \"research exemption\" in U.S.\r\npatent law is very tightly limited, but I would have laughed if\r\nyou had told me that even a research university was forbidden\r\nfrom doing research unless that research had no conceivable\r\npractical or academic worth--in other words that even in\r\nacademia, in a project with no commercial goal, the research\r\nexemption only covered research that was completely pointless.\r\n43 Why have an exemption at all, in that case? I would have told\r\nan academic cryptography researcher that he need not fear legal\r\nthreats from copyright owners simply for researching and\r\npublishing work on the vulnerabilities of copy protection\r\nschemes. 44 I would not have thought that one could patent the\r\nidea of having an electronic Dutch auction on the Internet,\r\nworking out the daily prices of a bundle of mutual funds through\r\nsimple arithmetic, or buying something online with one click. 45\r\nI would have assumed that celebrities' rights to control their\r\nimages should end with their deaths, and that courts would agree\r\nthat those rights were tightly limited by the First Amendment.\r\nYet, in each of these cases, I would have been wrong, or at\r\nleast I might be wrong--enough that a sane person would worry.\r\nNot all of the expansive claims eventually triumphed, of course,\r\nbut some did. Guessing which would and which would not was hard\r\neven for me, though, as I said, I teach intellectual property\r\nlaw. You, probably, do not.\r\n42\r\n\r\nIn 1950 none of this would have mattered. Unless you were in\r\nsome related business--as a publisher, broadcaster, film\r\ndistributor, or what have you--it would have been hard for you to\r\ntrigger the rules of intellectual property law. If you were in\r\nsuch a business, you were probably very familiar with the rules\r\nthat governed your activities and well represented by corporate\r\ncounsel who knew them even better. What's more, the rules were\r\nneither as complex nor as counterintuitive as they are now. They\r\nalso did not reach as far. The reach of the rights has been\r\nexpanded, and their content made more difficult to understand,\r\nat the exact moment that their practical effect has been\r\ntransformed. It is not merely that the triggers of intellectual\r\nproperty law can easily be set off by individual footsteps.\r\nThere are now many more triggers and their trip wires are harder\r\nto see.\r\n43\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of the content industries, of course, all\r\nthis is foolishness. It is not some undesirable accident that\r\nintellectual property has come to regulate personal,\r\nnoncommercial activity. It is absolutely necessary. Think of\r\nNapster. When individuals engaging in noncommercial activity\r\nhave the ability to threaten the music or film industry's\r\nbusiness plan by engaging in the very acts that copyright law\r\nalways regulated--namely reproduction and distribution--of course\r\nit is appropriate for them, and the networks they \"share\" on, to\r\nbe subject to liability. What's more, to the extent that copying\r\nbecomes cheaper and easier, it is necessary for us to strengthen\r\nintellectual property rights. We must meet the greater danger of\r\ncopying with more expansive rights, harsher penalties, and\r\nexpanded protections, some of which may indeed have the\r\npractical effect of reducing rights that citizens thought they\r\nhad, such as fair use, low-level noncommercial sharing among\r\npersonal friends, resale, and so on. Without an increase in\r\nprivate property rights, in other words, cheaper copying will\r\neat the heart out of our creative and cultural industries. I\r\ncall this claim the Internet Threat.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 4: The Internet Threat\r\n1\r\n\r\nThe conventional wisdom is that governments respond slowly to\r\ntechnological change. In the case of the Internet, nothing could\r\nbe further from the truth. In 1994 and 1995, \"dot-com\" was still\r\na mystical term for many. Most stories about the Internet dealt\r\nwith sexual predation rather than possibilities of extreme\r\nwealth. Internet commerce itself was barely an idea, and some of\r\nthe most exciting sites on the Web had pictures of coffeepots in\r\nuniversity departments far away. (\"See,\" one would proudly say\r\nto a technological neophyte friend when introducing him to the\r\nwonders of the Net, \"the pot is empty and we can see that live\r\nfrom here! This changes everything!\") It was an innocent time.\r\nYet the U.S. government was already turning the wheels of\r\nintellectual property policy to respond to the threat (and\r\npromise) of the Internet. More precisely, they were trying to\r\nshape the future of the cumbersomely named \"National Information\r\nInfrastructure,\" the official name for the \"information\r\nsuperhighway\" that it was presumed would replace the \"immature\"\r\ntechnology of the Net. The government was wrong about that, and\r\nabout a lot else.\r\n2\r\n\r\nThe blueprint for new intellectual property policy online came\r\nfrom the Patent and Trademark Office. That office promulgated\r\nfirst a Green Paper and then, after further hearings, a White\r\nPaper, on \"Intellectual Property and the National Information\r\nInfrastructure.\"1 As policy and legal documents these are in one\r\nsense long out of date. Some of their legal arguments were\r\nsuccessfully challenged. Some of their most important proposals\r\nwere rejected, while many others have become law. But as a\r\nstarting point from which to trace the frame of mind that has\r\ncome to dominate intellectual property policy online, they are\r\nhard to equal.\r\n3\r\n\r\nThese documents contained proposals that nowadays would be seen\r\nas fairly controversial. Internet service providers were said to\r\nbe \"strictly liable\" for copyright violations committed by their\r\nsubscribers; that is to say, they were legally responsible\r\nwhether or not they knew about the violation or were at fault in\r\nany way. Loading a document into your browser's transient cache\r\nmemory while reading it was said to be making a \"copy.\" There\r\nwas more: the beginnings of what later became the Digital\r\nMillennium Copyright Act,2 making it illegal to cut through the\r\ndigital fences which content providers put around their\r\nproducts. The attitude toward fair use was particularly\r\nrevealing. At one point in the White Paper it was hinted that\r\nfair use might be a relic of the inconveniences of the analog\r\nage, to be discarded now that we could have automated fractional\r\npayments for even the most insignificant use.3 (It was noted,\r\nhowever, that some disagreed with this conclusion.) At another\r\npoint, fair use was described as a \"tax\" on rights holders and a\r\n\"subsidy\" to those who benefited from it, such as educational\r\ninstitutions.4 The White Paper also suggested that while any\r\npotential loss to rights holders caused by the new technology\r\nneeded to be countered with new rights and new protections, any\r\npotential gain to them through the new technology was simply\r\ntheirs. Potential gain did not offset the need to compensate for\r\npotential loss.\r\n4\r\n\r\nSo what views of intellectual property were we carrying forward\r\ninto the Internet age? Intellectual property is just like other\r\nproperty. Rights are presumptively absolute. Any limitations on\r\nthem, such as fair use, are taxes on property owners, subsidies\r\nto the society at large. It sounds like a perfect time to\r\nadminister the Jefferson Warning I sketched out in Chapter 2.\r\nAfter all, Jefferson was specifically warning against each of\r\nthese errors two hundred years ago. To find them in a student\r\npaper would be disappointing--irritating, even. But this document\r\nwas the blueprint for the intellectual property regime of\r\ncyberspace.\r\n5\r\n\r\nBut do these mistakes matter? How important is it that we get\r\nthe rules of intellectual property right? To me, a number of my\r\ncolleagues, some librarians, a few software gurus, the White\r\nPaper was more than just a bit of bad policy in a technical\r\nfield--like a poorly drafted statute about the witnessing of\r\nwills, say. When you set up the property rules in some new\r\nspace, you determine much about the history that follows.\r\nProperty rules have a huge effect on power relationships and\r\nbargaining positions. Think of rules setting out water rights or\r\nthe right to drive cattle over homesteaders' land in the\r\nAmerican West. But they also are part of a larger way of seeing\r\nthe world; think of the early-twentieth-century rules treating\r\nunions as \"conspiracies in restraint of trade\" or the Supreme\r\nCourt decisions that dispossessed the American Indians on the\r\ntheory that they did not comprehend the concept of property and\r\nthus did not \"own\" the land being taken from them.5 We were at a\r\ncomparable point in the history of cyberspace. What was being\r\nset up here was a vision of economy and culture, a frame of mind\r\nabout how the world of cultural exchange operates, and\r\neventually a blueprint for our systems of communication. At this\r\nstage, the range of possibilities is extremely wide. A lot of\r\ndifferent choices could be made, but subsequent changes would be\r\nharder and harder as people and companies built their activities\r\naround the rules that had been laid down. This was, in short, a\r\ntipping point where it was particularly important that we make\r\nthe right decisions.\r\n6\r\n\r\nConventional political science told us there were a lot of\r\nreasons to fear that we would not make the right decisions. The\r\npolitical process was going to be particularly vulnerable to\r\nproblems of capture by established industries, many of whom\r\nwould (rightly) see the Internet as a potential threat to their\r\nrole as intermediaries between artists and creators on the one\r\nhand and the public on the other.\r\n7\r\n\r\nIntellectual property legislation had always been a cozy world\r\nin which the content, publishing, and distribution industries\r\nwere literally asked to draft the rules by which they would\r\nlive. The law was treated as a kind of contract between the\r\naffected industries. Rationally enough, those industries would\r\nwish to use the law not merely to protect their legitimate\r\nexisting property rights, but to make challenges to their basic\r\nbusiness plans illegal. (Imagine what would have happened if we\r\nhad given the lamp-oil sellers the right to define the rules\r\nunder which the newfangled electric light companies would\r\noperate.) There would be no easy counterweight to these\r\npressures, as Jessica Litman points out in a wonderful set of\r\nreflections on copyright lawmaking, because the potential\r\ncompetitors to existing titans were just being born and could\r\nthus be strangled safely in their cradles.6 Certainly the public\r\nwould have little grasp as yet of what was at stake.\r\n8\r\n\r\nIn any event, when had the public played a role in intellectual\r\nproperty legislation? That kind of law affected businesses with\r\nprinting presses or TV towers, not normal citizens. It did not\r\nhelp that the legislators were largely both ignorant and\r\ndistrustful of the technology of the Internet--which was, at the\r\ntime, thought to be dominated by foreign hackers, suicidal\r\ncults, pirates, and sleazy pornographers. (Terrorists and\r\nNigerian spammers would be added to the mix later.)\r\n9\r\n\r\nGiven an area of law that legislators were happy to hand over to\r\nthe affected industries and a technology that was both\r\nunfamiliar and threatening, the prospects for legislative\r\ninsight were poor. Lawmakers were assured by lobbyists\r\n10\r\n\r\na) that this was business as usual, that no dramatic changes\r\nwere being made by the Green or White papers; or\r\nb) that the technology presented a terrible menace to the\r\nAmerican cultural industries, but that prompt and statesmanlike\r\naction would save the day; or\r\nc) that layers of new property rights, new private enforcers of\r\nthose rights, and technological control and surveillance\r\nmeasures were all needed in order to benefit consumers, who\r\nwould now be able to \"purchase culture by the sip rather than by\r\nthe glass\" in a pervasively monitored digital environment.\r\n11\r\n\r\nIn practice, somewhat confusingly, these three arguments would\r\noften be combined. Legislators' statements seemed to suggest\r\nthat this was a routine Armageddon in which firm, decisive\r\nstatesmanship was needed to preserve the digital status quo in a\r\nprofoundly transformative and proconsumer way. Reading the\r\ncongressional debates was likely to give one conceptual\r\nwhiplash.\r\n12\r\n\r\nTo make things worse, the press was--in 1995, at least--clueless\r\nabout these issues. It was not that the newspapers were ignoring\r\nthe Internet. They were paying attention--obsessive attention in\r\nsome cases. But as far as the mainstream press was concerned,\r\nthe story line on the Internet was sex: pornography, online\r\npredation, more pornography. The lowbrow press stopped there. To\r\nbe fair, the highbrow press was also interested in Internet\r\nlegal issues (the regulation of pornography, the regulation of\r\nonline predation) and constitutional questions (the First\r\nAmendment protection of Internet pornography). Reporters were\r\nalso asking questions about the social effect of the network\r\n(including, among other things, the threats posed by pornography\r\nand online predators).\r\n13\r\n\r\nThere were certainly important issues within the areas the press\r\nwas willing to focus on, and I do not mean to trivialize them. I\r\nworked with a couple of civil liberties groups in opposing the\r\nhapless Communications Decency Act, one of the most poorly\r\ndrafted pieces of speech regulation ever to come out of\r\nCongress.7 It was a palpably unconstitutional statute,\r\neventually struck down by a unanimous Supreme Court.8 Its\r\nproposals would have burdened the speech of adults while failing\r\nto protect the interests of minors. Reporters loved the topic of\r\nthe Communications Decency Act. It was about sex, technology,\r\nand the First Amendment. It foreshadowed the future of online\r\nspeech regulation. One could write about it while feeling\r\nsimultaneously prurient, principled, and prescient: the\r\njournalistic trifecta. For law professors who worked on digital\r\nissues, the Communications Decency Act was an easy topic to get\r\nthe public to focus on; we had the reporters and editors calling\r\nus, pleading for a quote or an opinion piece.\r\n14\r\n\r\nIntellectual property was something quite different. It was\r\noccasionally covered in the business pages with the same\r\nenthusiasm devoted to changes in derivatives rules. Presented\r\nwith the proposals in the Green and White Papers, the reporters\r\nwent looking for opinions from the Software Publishers\r\nAssociation, the Recording Industry Association of America, or\r\nthe Motion Picture Association of America. This was not bias or\r\nlaziness--to whom else would they go? Who was on the \"other side\"\r\nof these issues? Remember, all of this occurred before Napster\r\nwas a gleam in Sean Fanning's eye. Sean Fanning was in middle\r\nschool. Amazon.com was a new company and \"Google\" was not yet a\r\nverb.\r\n15\r\n\r\nIn this environment, convincing the legislature or the press\r\nthat fundamental public choices were implicated in the design of\r\nintellectual property rights for the digital world was about as\r\neasy as convincing them that fundamental public choices were\r\nimplicated in the rules of tiddlywinks. My own experience is\r\nprobably representative. I remember trying to pitch an article\r\non the subject to a charming but uncomprehending opinion page\r\neditor at the Washington Post. I tried to explain that decisions\r\nabout property rules would shape the way we thought about the\r\ntechnology. Would the relatively anonymous and decentralized\r\ncharacteristics of the Internet that made it such a powerful\r\ntool for global speech and debate come to be seen as a bug\r\nrather than a feature, something to be \"fixed\" to make the Net\r\nsafe for protected content? The rules would also shape the\r\neconomic interests that drove future policy. Would we try to\r\nbuild the system around the model of proprietary content\r\ndispensed in tightly controlled chunks? Would fair use be made\r\ntechnologically obsolescent? Would we undercut the various\r\nnontraditional methods of innovation, such as free software,\r\nbefore they ever managed to establish themselves? What would\r\nbecome of libraries in the digital world, of the ideal that\r\naccess to books had important differences from access to\r\nTwinkies? After I concluded this lengthy and slightly incoherent\r\ncri de Coeur, there was a long pause; then the editor said\r\npolitely, \"Are you sure you couldn't make some of these points\r\nabout a free speech issue, like the Communications Decency Act,\r\nmaybe?\"\r\n16\r\n\r\nI finally placed the piece in the Washington Times,9 which was\r\nbest known at the time as the only metropolitan newspaper owned\r\nby the Unification Church, familiarly referred to as the\r\nMoonies. This hardly counted as a direct line to the popular\r\nimagination (though the article's mild criticisms elicited an\r\nextraordinary reaction from the Clinton administration's lead\r\nofficial on intellectual property policy--throwing me for several\r\nweeks into a surreal world of secondhand threats, third-party\r\nleaks, and a hilarious back-and-forth in the letters page).10\r\n17\r\n\r\nThings were not completely one-sided. An unlikely group of\r\ncritics had formed: librarians, a few software developers, law\r\nprofessors, some Internet libertarians. Of particular note was\r\nthe Digital Future Coalition, which grew to represent a broad\r\nrange of interested groups and industries thanks in part to the\r\nprescient analysis and remarkable energy of one of my\r\ncolleagues, Peter Jaszi.11 Together with Pamela Samuelson,\r\nJessica Litman, and a number of other distinguished legal\r\nscholars, Peter turned his considerable intellectual talents to\r\nexplaining why writers, telecom companies, scientists,\r\nmanufacturers of consumer electronics, and a host of other\r\ngroups should be interested in the rules being debated. There\r\nhad been a series of official hearings in which complaints were\r\ncarefully collected and just as carefully ignored. This became\r\nharder to do as the critics became more numerous and better\r\norganized. Nevertheless, the currents were clearly running\r\nagainst them. It would be nice to say that this was merely\r\nbecause of the clubby history of intellectual property\r\nlegislation, or the difficulty in getting press attention, or\r\nthe various issues of industry capture and collective action\r\nproblems. Yet this would be to miss a vital element of the\r\nsituation.\r\n18\r\n\r\nConventional political science showed that there were structural\r\nreasons why the legislative process was likely to succumb to\r\nindustry capture.12 The reality turned out to be much worse. The\r\nreal problem was not a political process dominated by cynical\r\npower politics, nor an initial absence of critical newspaper\r\ncoverage, though both of those factors contributed. The real\r\nproblem was that most of the proponents of the White Paper's\r\npolicies believed their own arguments so deeply and sincerely\r\nthat they saw any criticism of those positions as either godless\r\ncommunism or hippy digital anarchism. (Frequently, in fact, they\r\nclung to their arguments even when there was fairly strong\r\nevidence that they would actually be harming themselves by\r\nputting these policies into effect. I will expand on this point\r\nlater.) More importantly, they succeeded in getting their story\r\nabout the threats and promises of the digital future accepted as\r\nthe basis for all discussion of intellectual property policy. It\r\nbecame the organizing set of principles, the master\r\nnarrative--call it what you will.\r\n19\r\n\r\nThe heart of the story is beguilingly simple. The Internet makes\r\ncopying cheaper and does so on an unparalleled global scale.\r\nTherefore we must meet the greater danger of illicit copying\r\nwith more expansive rights, harsher penalties, and expanded\r\nprotections. True, as I pointed out before, some of these\r\nexpansions may indeed have the practical effect of reducing\r\nrights that citizens thought they had, such as fair use, low-\r\nlevel noncommercial sharing among personal friends, resale, and\r\nso on. But without an increase in private property rights,\r\ncheaper copying will eat the heart out of our creative and\r\ncultural industries. I call this story the Internet Threat. It\r\nis a powerful argument and it deserves some explanation.\r\n20\r\n\r\nThink back for a moment to the first chapter and the difference\r\nbetween Madame Bovary and the petunia. If the reason for\r\nintellectual property rights is the \"nonrival\" and\r\n\"nonexcludable\" nature of the goods they protect, then surely\r\nthe lowering of copying and transmission costs implies a\r\ncorresponding need to increase the strength of intellectual\r\nproperty rights. Imagine a line. At one end sits a monk\r\npainstakingly transcribing Aristotle's Poetics. In the middle\r\nlies the Gutenberg printing press. Three-quarters of the way\r\nalong the line is a photocopying machine. At the far end lies\r\nthe Internet and the online version of the human genome. At each\r\nstage, copying costs are lowered and goods become both less\r\nrival and less excludable. My MP3 files are available to anyone\r\nin the world running Napster. Songs can be found and copied with\r\nease. The symbolic end of rivalry comes when I am playing the\r\nsong in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, at the very moment that you\r\nare both downloading and listening to it in Kazakhstan--now that\r\nis nonrival.\r\n21\r\n\r\nTHE LOGIC OF PERFECT CONTROL\r\n22\r\n\r\nMy point is that there is a teleology--a theory about how\r\nintellectual property law must develop historically--hidden\r\ninside the argument I call the Internet Threat. The argument,\r\nwhich is touted endlessly by the content industries--and not\r\nwithout reason--can be reduced to this: The strength of\r\nintellectual property rights must vary inversely with the cost\r\nof copying. With high copying costs, one needs weak intellectual\r\nproperty rights if any at all. To deal with the monk-copyist, we\r\nneed no copyright because physical control of the manuscript is\r\nenough. What does it matter if I say I will copy your\r\nmanuscript, if I must do it by hand? How will this present a\r\nthreat to you? There is no need to create a legal right to\r\nexclude others from copying, no need for a \"copy right.\" As\r\ncopying costs fall, however, the need to exclude increases. To\r\ndeal with the Gutenberg press, we need the Statute of Anne--the\r\nfirst copyright statute--and the long evolution of copyright it\r\nushered in.\r\n23\r\n\r\nBut then comes the Internet. To deal with the Internet, we need\r\nthe Digital Millennium Copyright Act,13 the No Electronic Theft\r\nAct,14 the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act,15 and\r\nperhaps even the Collections of Information Antipiracy Act.16 As\r\ncopying costs approach zero, intellectual property rights must\r\napproach perfect control. We must strengthen the rights,\r\nlengthen the term of the rights, increase the penalties, and\r\nmake noncommercial illicit copying a crime. We must move outside\r\nthe traditional realm of copyright altogether to regulate the\r\ntechnology around the copyrighted material. Companies are\r\nsurrounding their digital materials with digital fences. We must\r\nmake it a violation of the law to cut those digital fences, even\r\nif you do so to make a \"fair use\" of the material on the other\r\nside. We must prohibit the making of things that can be used as\r\nfence-cutters--a prospect that worries researchers on encryption.\r\nIn the long run, we must get rid of the troublesome anonymity of\r\nthe Internet, requiring each computer to have an individual ID.\r\nWe must make click-wrap contracts enforceable, even on third\r\nparties, even when you cannot read them before clicking--so that\r\nyou never actually buy the software, music, movies, and e-books\r\nyou download, merely \"license\" them for a narrowly defined range\r\nof uses. We must create interlocking software and hardware\r\nsystems that monitor and control the material played on those\r\nsystems--so that songs can be licensed to particular computers at\r\nparticular times. Uses that the owners wish to forbid will\r\nactually be impossible, whether they are legal or not.\r\n24\r\n\r\nIn other words, we must make this technology of the Internet,\r\nwhich was hailed as the great \"technology of freedom,\" into a\r\ntechnology of control and surveillance. The possibility of\r\nindividuals circulating costless perfect digital copies requires\r\nit. It would be facile (if tempting) to say we must remake the\r\nInternet to make it safe for Britney Spears. The \"Internet\r\nThreat\" argument is that we must remake the Net if we want\r\ndigital creativity--whether in music or software or movies or e-\r\ntexts. And since the strength of the property rights varies\r\ninversely with the cost of copying, costless copying means that\r\nthe remade Net must approach perfect control, both in its legal\r\nregime and its technical architecture.\r\n25\r\n\r\nLike any attractive but misleading argument, the Internet Threat\r\nhas a lot of truth. Ask the software company producing\r\nexpensive, specialized computer-assisted design programs costing\r\nthousands of dollars what happens when the program is made\r\navailable on a \"warez\" site or a peer-to-peer filesharing\r\nnetwork. The upstart computer game company pinning its hopes and\r\nits capital on a single new game would tell you the same thing.\r\nThe easy availability of perfect, costless copies is a danger to\r\nall kinds of valuable cultural and economic production. The\r\nstory of the Internet Threat is not wrong, it is simply\r\ndramatically incomplete in lots of ways. Here are two of them.\r\n26\r\n\r\nCostless Copying Brings Both\r\nCosts and Benefits\r\n27\r\n\r\nThe Internet does lower the cost of copying and thus the cost of\r\nillicit copying. Of course, it also lowers the costs of\r\nproduction, distribution, and advertising, and dramatically\r\nincreases the size of the potential market. Is the net result a\r\nloss to rights holders such that we need to increase protection\r\nand control in order to maintain a constant level of incentives?\r\nA large, leaky market may actually provide more revenue than a\r\nsmall one over which one's control is much stronger. What's\r\nmore, the same technologies that allow for cheap copying also\r\nallow for swift and encyclopedic search engines--the best devices\r\never invented for detecting illicit copying. What the Net takes\r\naway with one hand, it often gives back with the other. Cheaper\r\ncopying does not merely mean loss, it also means opportunity.\r\nBefore strengthening intellectual property rights, we would need\r\nto know whether the loss was greater than the gain and whether\r\nrevised business models and new distribution mechanisms could\r\navoid the losses while capturing more of the gains.\r\n28\r\n\r\nBut wait, surely theft is theft? If the new technologies enable\r\nmore theft of intellectual property, must we not strengthen the\r\nlaws in order to deal with the problem? If some new technology\r\nled to a rash of car thefts, we might increase police resources\r\nand prison sentences, perhaps pass new legislation creating new\r\ncrimes related to car theft. We would do all of this even if the\r\ntechnology in question gave car owners significant benefits\r\nelsewhere. Theft is theft, is it not?\r\n29\r\n\r\nThe answer in a word is no. Saying \"theft is theft\" is exactly\r\nthe error that the Jefferson Warning is supposed to guard\r\nagainst. We should not assume that intellectual property and\r\nmaterial property are the same in all regards. The goal of\r\ncreating the limited monopoly called an intellectual property\r\nright is to provide the minimum necessary incentive to encourage\r\nthe desired level of innovation. Anything extra is deadweight\r\nloss. When someone takes your car, they have the car and you do\r\nnot. When, because of some new technology, someone is able to\r\nget access to the MP3 file of your new song, they have the file\r\nand so do you. You did not lose the song. What you may have lost\r\nis the opportunity to sell the song to that person or to the\r\npeople with whom they \"share\" the file. We should not be\r\nindifferent to this kind of loss; it is a serious concern. But\r\nthe fact that a new technology brings economic benefits as well\r\nas economic harm to the creation, distribution, and sale of\r\nintellectual property products means that we should pause before\r\nincreasing the level of rights, changing the architecture of our\r\ncommunications networks, creating new crimes, and so on.\r\n30\r\n\r\nRemember, many of the things that the content industries were\r\nconcerned about on the Internet were already illegal, already\r\nsubject to suit and prosecution. The question is not whether the\r\nInternet should be an intellectual property-free zone; it should\r\nnot be, is not, and never was. The question is whether, when the\r\ncontent industries come asking for additional or new rights, for\r\nnew penalties, for the criminalization of certain types of\r\ntechnology, we should take into account the gains that the\r\nInternet has brought them, as well as the costs, before we\r\naccede to their requests. The answer, of course, is that we\r\nshould. Sadly, we did not. This does not mean that all of the\r\ncontent industries' attempts to strengthen the law are wrong and\r\nunnecessary. It means that we do not know whether they are or\r\nnot.\r\n31\r\n\r\nThere is a fairly solid tradition in intellectual property\r\npolicy of what I call \"20/20 downside\" vision. All of the\r\nthreats posed by any new technology--the player piano, the\r\njukebox, the photocopier, the VCR, the Internet--are seen with\r\nextraordinary clarity. The opportunities, however, particularly\r\nthose which involve changing a business model or restructuring a\r\nmarket, are dismissed as phantoms. The downside dominates the\r\nfield, the upside is invisible. The story of video recorders is\r\nthe best-known example. When video recorders--another technology\r\npromising cheaper copying--first appeared, the reaction of movie\r\nstudios was one of horror. Their business plans relied upon\r\nshowing movies in theaters and then licensing them to television\r\nstations. VCRs and Betamaxes fit nowhere in this plan; they were\r\nseen merely as copyright violation devices. Hollywood tried to\r\nhave them taxed to pay for the losses that would be caused.\r\nTheir assumption? Cheaper copying demands stronger rights.\r\n32\r\n\r\nHaving lost that battle, the movie studios tried to have the\r\nmanufacturers of the recording devices found liable for\r\ncontributory copyright infringement; liable, in other words, for\r\nassisting the copyright violations that could be carried out by\r\nthe owners of Sony Betamaxes. This, of course, was exactly the\r\nsame legal claim that would be made in the Napster case. In the\r\nSony case, however, the movie companies lost. The Supreme Court\r\nsaid that recording of TV programs to \"time-shift\" them to a\r\nmore convenient hour was a fair use.17 The movie studios' claims\r\nwere rejected.\r\n33\r\n\r\nFreed from the threat of liability, the price of video recorders\r\ncontinued to fall. They flooded consumers' houses at a speed\r\nunparalleled until the arrival of the World Wide Web. All these\r\nboxes sitting by TVs now cried out for content, content that was\r\nprovided by an emerging video rental market. Until the triumph\r\nof DVDs, the videocassette rental market made up more than 50\r\npercent of the movie industry's revenues.18 Were losses caused\r\nby video recorders? To be sure. Some people who might have gone\r\nto see a movie in a theater because the TV schedule was\r\ninconvenient could instead record the show and watch it later.\r\nVideos could even be shared with friends and families--tattered\r\ncopies of Disney movies recorded from some cable show could be\r\npassed on to siblings whose kids have reached the appropriate\r\nage. VCRs were also used for copying that was clearly\r\nillicit--large-scale duplication and sale of movies by someone\r\nother than the rights holder. A cheaper copying technology\r\ndefinitely caused losses. But it also provided substantial\r\ngains, gains that far outweighed the losses. Ironically, had the\r\nmovie companies \"won\" in the Sony case, they might now be worse\r\noff.\r\n34\r\n\r\nThe Sony story provides us with some useful lessons--first, this\r\n20/20 downside vision is a poor guide to copyright policy. Under\r\nits sway, some companies will invariably equate greater control\r\nwith profit and cheaper copying with loss. They will conclude,\r\nsometimes rightly, that their very existence is threatened, and,\r\nsometimes wrongly, that the threat is to innovation and culture\r\nitself rather than to their particular way of delivering it.\r\nThey will turn to the legislature and the courts for guarantees\r\nthat they can go on doing business in the old familiar ways.\r\nNormally, the marketplace is supposed to provide correctives to\r\nthis kind of myopia. Upstart companies, not bound by the habits\r\nof the last generation, are supposed to move nimbly to harvest\r\nthe benefits from the new technology and to outcompete the\r\nlumbering dinosaurs. In certain situations, though, competition\r\nwill not work:\r\n35\r\n\r\n*  if the dinosaurs are a cartel strong enough to squelch\r\ncompetition;\r\n*  if they have enlisted the state to make the threatening\r\ntechnology illegal, describing it as a predatory encroachment on\r\nthe \"rights\" of the old guard rather than aggressive\r\ncompetition;\r\n*  if ingrained prejudices are simply so strong that the\r\npotential business benefits take years to become apparent; or\r\n*  if the market has \"locked in\" on a dominant standard--a\r\ntechnology or an operating system, say--to which new market\r\nentrants do not have legal access.\r\n36\r\n\r\nIn those situations, markets cannot be counted on to self-\r\ncorrect. Unfortunately, and this is a key point, intellectual\r\nproperty policy frequently deals with controversies in which all\r\nof these conditions hold true.\r\n37\r\n\r\nLet me repeat this point, because it is one of the most\r\nimportant ones in this book. To a political scientist or market\r\nanalyst, the conditions I have just described sound like a\r\nrarely seen perfect storm of legislative and market dysfunction.\r\nTo an intellectual property scholar, they sound like business as\r\nusual.\r\n38\r\n\r\nIn the case of the VCR wars, none of these factors obtained. The\r\nstate refused to step in to aid the movie companies by\r\ncriminalizing the new technology. There were equally powerful\r\ncompanies on the other side of the issue (the consumer\r\nelectronics companies selling VCRs) who saw this new market as a\r\nnatural extension of a familiar existing market--audio recorders.\r\nThere was no dominant proprietary technological standard\r\ncontrolled by the threatened industry that could be used to shut\r\ndown any threats to their business model. The market was allowed\r\nto develop and evolve without premature legal intervention or\r\nproprietary technological lockout. Thus we know in this case\r\nthat the movie companies were wrong, that their claims of\r\nimpending doom from cheap copies were completely mistaken. The\r\npublic and, ironically, the industry itself benefited as a\r\nresult. But the Sony case is the exception rather than the rule.\r\nThat is why it is so important. If competition and change can be\r\nforbidden, we will get relatively few cases that disprove the\r\nlogic that cheaper copying must always mean stronger rights. The\r\n\"natural experiments\" will never be allowed to happen. They will\r\nbe squelched by those who see only threat in the technologies\r\nthat allow cheaper copies and who can persuade legislators or\r\njudges to see the world their way. The story line I describe\r\nhere, the Internet Threat, will become the conventional wisdom.\r\nIn the process, it will make it much less likely that we will\r\nhave the evidence needed to refute it.\r\n39\r\n\r\nThe Holes Matter as Much as the Cheese\r\n40\r\n\r\nThe Sony case is important in another way. The Supreme Court's\r\ndecision turned on the judgment that it was a \"fair use\" under\r\nU.S. copyright law for consumers to record television programs\r\nfor time-shifting purposes. Since fair use comes up numerous\r\ntimes in this book, it is worth pausing for a moment to explain\r\nwhat it is.\r\n41\r\n\r\nThe content industries like to portray fair use as a narrow and\r\ngrudging defense against an otherwise valid case for copyright\r\ninfringement--as if the claim were, \"Yes, I trespassed on your\r\nland, which was wrong, I admit. But I was starving and looking\r\nfor food. Please give me a break.\" This is simply inaccurate.\r\nTrue, fair use is asserted as \"an affirmative defense\"; that is\r\nthe way it is brought up in a copyright case. But in U.S. law,\r\nfair uses are stated quite clearly to be limitations on the\r\nexclusive rights of the copyright holder--uses that were never\r\nwithin the copyright holder's power to prohibit. The defense is\r\nnot \"I trespassed on your land, but I was starving.\" It is \"I\r\ndid not trespass on your land. I walked on the public road that\r\nruns through it, a road you never owned in the first place.\"\r\nWhen society hands out the right to the copyright holder, it\r\ncarves out certain areas of use and refuses to hand over control\r\nof them. Again, remember the Jefferson Warning. This is not a\r\npresumptively absolute property right. It is a conditional grant\r\nof a limited and temporary monopoly. One cannot start from the\r\npresumption that the rights holder has absolute rights over all\r\npossible uses and therefore that any time a citizen makes use of\r\nthe work in any way, the rights holder is entitled to get paid\r\nor to claim \"piracy\" if he does not get paid. Under the sway of\r\nthe story line I called the Internet Threat, legislators have\r\nlost sight of this point.\r\n42\r\n\r\nSo what is \"fair use\"? When I am asked this question by\r\nnonlawyers, I offer to show them the actual provision in the\r\ncopyright act. They recoil, clearly imagining they are about to\r\nbe shown something the size and complexity of the tax code. Here\r\nis the statutory fair use provision in its entirety:\r\n43\r\n\r\n    Sec. 107. - Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair use\r\n\r\n44\r\n\r\n    Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the\r\nfair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by\r\nreproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means\r\nspecified by that section, for purposes such as criticism,\r\ncomment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for\r\nclassroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement\r\nof copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in\r\nany particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered\r\nshall include--\r\n\r\n45\r\n\r\n(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such\r\nuse is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational\r\npurposes;\r\n(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;\r\n(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in\r\nrelation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and\r\n(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value\r\nof the copyrighted work.\r\n46\r\n\r\nThe fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a\r\nfinding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration\r\nof all the above factors.\r\n47\r\n\r\n\"But this seems quite sensible,\" people often say, as though\r\nthey had expected both Byzantine complexity and manifest\r\nirrationality. (Perhaps they have had some experience with legal\r\nmatters after all.) The ones who think about it a little longer\r\nrealize that these factors cannot be mechanically applied. Look\r\nat factor 3, for example. Someone who is making a parody\r\nfrequently needs to take large chunks of the parodied work. That\r\nis the nature of a parody, after all. They might then sell the\r\nparody, thus also getting into trouble with factor 1. And what\r\nabout factor 4? Someone might quote big chunks of my book in a\r\ndevastating review that ruined any chance the book had of\r\nselling well. Come to think of it, even a parody might have a\r\nnegative effect on the \"potential market\" for the parodied work.\r\nBut surely those uses would still be \"fair\"? (In both instances,\r\nthe Supreme Court agrees that they are fair uses.)\r\n48\r\n\r\nIn coming up with these hypothetical problem cases, the\r\ncopyright novice is probably closer to having a good\r\nunderstanding of the purpose of fair use than many people who\r\nhave studied it for years. In fact, the novice's questions shed\r\nlight on all of the exceptions, limitations, and defenses to\r\nproprietary rights--the holes in the cheese of intellectual\r\nproperty. The scholar's urge is to find one theory that explains\r\nall the possible applications of the fair use doctrine, to\r\narrange all of the cases like targets and shoot a single arrow\r\nthrough all of them. Perhaps fair use is designed to reduce the\r\ndifficulty of clearing rights when it would be uneconomical or\r\nimpossibly complex to do so: to reduce the paperwork, hassle,\r\ndelay, ignorance, and aggravation that economists refer to under\r\nthe sanguine name of \"transaction costs.\"19 (Though the idea\r\nthat fair use is about transaction costs hardly explains some of\r\nthe types of fair use we care most about--the rights to parody,\r\nto criticize, to reverse engineer.) Or perhaps fair use allows\r\nthe rights of a transformative author to be trumped only by a\r\nsecond transformative author, who is building on the first--the\r\nparodist, reviewer, collage artist, or what have you.20 (Then\r\nagain, photocopying for classroom use does not sound very\r\n\"transformative.\") Could fair use be dictated by the\r\nConstitution or by international free speech guarantees? In this\r\nview, fair use provides a safety valve that allows copyright to\r\ncoexist with the First Amendment, property rights over speech to\r\ncoexist with freedom of expression.21 After all, it is not\r\nentirely obvious how it could be constitutional to forbid me, in\r\nthe name of a federal law, from translating Mein Kampf in order\r\nto warn of the dangers of fascism or parodying some piece of art\r\nto subversive effect.\r\n49\r\n\r\nEach of these ideas about fair use has much to recommend it, as\r\ndo the many other grand theories that have been offered to\r\nexplain the puzzle. And therein lies the problem.\r\n50\r\n\r\nIntellectual property is a brilliant social invention which\r\npresents us with great benefits but also with a multitude of\r\ndangers:\r\n51\r\n\r\n1. the danger that the monopoly is unnecessary to produce the\r\ninnovation, or that it is broader or lasts for longer than is\r\nnecessary to encourage future production;\r\n\r\n2. that overly broad rights will chill speech, criticism, or\r\nscientific progress;\r\n\r\n3. that it will restrict access in ways that discourage \"follow-\r\non\" innovation;\r\n\r\n4. that it will lead to industry concentration in a way that\r\nhurts consumers or citizens while being less subject to\r\nantitrust regulation precisely because the monopoly or oligopoly\r\nrests on intellectual property rights;\r\n\r\n5. that it will establish strong \"network effects\" which cause\r\nthe market to tip over to some inefficient technology; and\r\n\r\n6. that it will give the rights holder control over some\r\ntechnology outside the range of the monopoly but closely linked\r\nto it.\r\n52\r\n\r\nThe list of dangers goes on and on, and so does the list of\r\nexceptions, limitations, and restraints designed to prevent\r\nthem. We restrict the length of intellectual property rights.\r\n(At least, we used to. The framers thought it so important to do\r\nso that they put the need to have a limited term in the\r\nConstitution itself; nevertheless both Congress and the Supreme\r\nCourt seem to have given up on that one.) We restrict the scope\r\nof intellectual property rights, so that they cannot cover raw\r\nfacts or general ideas, only the range of innovation and\r\nexpression in between. (At least, we used to. Developments in\r\ndatabase protection, gene patents, and business method patents\r\nare clearly eroding those walls.) As with fair use, we impose\r\nlimitations on the rights when we hand them out in the first\r\nplace. The exclusive right conferred by copyright does not\r\ninclude the right to prevent criticism, parody, classroom\r\ncopying, decompilation of computer programs, and so on. (Though\r\nas the next chapter shows, a number of recent legal changes mean\r\nthat the practical ability to exercise fair use rights is\r\nseriously threatened.)\r\n53\r\n\r\nThese limitations on intellectual property do not fit a single\r\ntheory, unless that theory is \"avoiding the multiple and\r\nevolving dangers of intellectual property itself.\" Even a single\r\nlimitation such as fair use clearly responds to many different\r\nconcerns about the dangers of intellectual property rights.\r\nIndeed it will evolve to fit new circumstances. When computer\r\nprograms were first clearly covered by copyright law, software\r\nengineers wondered if this would cripple the industry. Why?\r\nAnyone who wishes to compete with a dominant program needs to\r\n\"decompile\" it in order to make their program \"interoperable,\"\r\nor simply better. For example, a new word processing program, no\r\nmatter how good, would be dead on arrival unless it could read\r\nall the files people had created with the old, dominant word\r\nprocessing software. But to do this, the engineers at the\r\nupstart company would have to take apart their competitor's\r\nprogram. In the process they would have to create temporary\r\ncopies of the old program, even though the final product--the hot\r\nnew software--would be completely different from the old. Would\r\nthis be a violation of copyright law?\r\n54\r\n\r\nIn a series of remarkable and far-seeing cases involving such\r\nissues, the courts said no.22 \"Decompilation\" was fair use. The\r\nlaw of fair use had evolved in the context of expressive,\r\nnonfunctional, stand-alone works such as books, poems, songs.\r\nNow it was being applied to a functional product whose economics\r\ndepended strongly on \"network effects\"--many types of programs\r\nare useful only if they are widely used. Without\r\ninteroperability, we could never take our existing documents or\r\nspreadsheets or datasets and move to a new program, even if it\r\nwas better. One program would not be able to read the files\r\ncreated by another. It would be as if language itself had been\r\ncopyrighted. To have said that the incidental copies created in\r\nthe process of decompiling software were actually infringements\r\nof copyright would have turned the law on its head because of a\r\ntechnological accident (you needed temporarily to \"copy\" the\r\nprograms in order to understand how they worked and make yours\r\nwork with them) and a legal accident (copyright was now being\r\nused to regulate functional articles of commerce: \"machines\"\r\nmade of binary code). The difference between copying and\r\nreading, or copying and understanding, had changed because of\r\nthe technology. The context had changed because the law was\r\nbeing stretched to cover new types of products, whose economics\r\nwere very different from those of novels. Rather than let the\r\ndominant software companies use copyright to stop others from\r\nmaking interoperable software, the courts used an escape\r\nhatch--fair use--to prevent that danger and to uphold the basic\r\ngoal of copyright: encouraging progress in science and the\r\nuseful arts.\r\n55\r\n\r\nThis long story is told to make a simple point. The variegated\r\nand evolving limitations on intellectual property are as\r\nimportant as the rights they constrain, curtail, and define. The\r\nholes matter as much as the cheese.\r\n56\r\n\r\nWhat does this have to do with the Sony case? In that case,\r\nremember, the Supreme Court had said that copying TV shows in\r\norder to time-shift was fair use. The Court could simply have\r\nstopped there. It could have said, \"since most of what consumers\r\ndo is legal, there can be no claim of contributory or vicarious\r\ninfringement. Sony is not contributing to infringement since\r\nconsumers are not infringing copyright by copying shows in the\r\nfirst place.\" Interestingly, though this is the heart of the\r\nruling, the court went further. It quoted some seemingly\r\nunrelated patent law doctrine on contributory infringement: \"A\r\nfinding of contributory infringement does not, of course, remove\r\nthe article from the market altogether; it does, however, give\r\nthe patentee effective control over the sale of that item.\r\nIndeed, a finding of contributory infringement is normally the\r\nfunctional equivalent of holding that the disputed article is\r\nwithin the monopoly granted to the patentee.\" Clearly, the\r\nJustices were concerned that, by using copyright law, the movie\r\nstudios could actually get control of a new technology.\r\n57\r\n\r\nThe fact that the Court expressed this concern through an\r\nanalogy to patent law was, at first sight, fairly surprising.\r\nCourts do not normally look at copyrights in quite the same way\r\nas they look at patents. For one thing, patent rights are\r\nstronger, though they are harder to obtain and last for a\r\nshorter period of time. For another, while courts often express\r\nconcern about the dangers of a patent-driven monopoly over a\r\nparticular technology, it is strange to see that concern in the\r\ncontext of copyright law. An unnecessary monopoly over a plow or\r\na grain elevator may, as Jefferson pointed out, slow\r\ntechnological development. But a monopoly over Snow White or\r\n\"Ode on a Grecian Urn\"? We do not normally think of rights over\r\nexpression (the realm of copyright) threatening to sweep within\r\ntheir ambit an entire new technological invention (the realm of\r\npatent).\r\n58\r\n\r\nBut in the Sony case, the Supreme Court quite clearly saw that,\r\nin a world where technological developments made copying easier,\r\nthe idea of contributory infringement in copyright could be used\r\nto suppress or control entire technologies that seemed, in the\r\nlogic of 20/20 downside vision, to pose a threat to the\r\ncopyright holder. Indeed, in some sense, the logic behind the\r\nInternet Threat--\"cheaper copying requires greater\r\ncontrol\"--demands this result, though the Sony case antedates the\r\nWorld Wide Web by a considerable time. If it is cheap copying\r\nitself that poses the threat, then the content owners will\r\nincreasingly move to gain control over the technologies of cheap\r\ncopying, using copyright as their stalking horse. That is why\r\nthe Sony Court went beyond the simple ruling on fair use to\r\nexplain the consequences of the movie companies' claim. In a\r\nfootnote (the place where judges often bury their most trenchant\r\nasides) the Court was almost snide:\r\n59\r\n\r\n    It seems extraordinary to suggest that the Copyright Act\r\nconfers upon all copyright owners collectively, much less the\r\ntwo respondents in this case, the exclusive right to distribute\r\nVTR's [Video Tape Recorders] simply because they may be used to\r\ninfringe copyrights. That, however, is the logical implication\r\nof their claim. The request for an injunction below indicates\r\nthat respondents seek, in effect, to declare VTR's contraband.\r\nTheir suggestion in this Court that a continuing royalty\r\npursuant to a judicially created compulsory license would be an\r\nacceptable remedy merely indicates that respondents, for their\r\npart, would be willing to license their claimed monopoly\r\ninterest in VTR's to Sony in return for a royalty.23\r\n\r\n60\r\n\r\nThe real heart of the Sony case is not that \"time-shifting\" of\r\nTV programs is fair use. It is an altogether deeper principle\r\nwith implications for all of the holes in the intellectual\r\nproperty cheese. The Sony Court declared that because video\r\nrecorders were capable of substantial noninfringing uses, the\r\nmanufacturers of those devices were not guilty of contributory\r\ninfringement. If the rights of copyright holders were absolute,\r\nif they had the authority to prohibit any activity that appeared\r\nto pose a threat to their current business model, then it is\r\nquite possible that video recorders would have been guilty of\r\ncontributory infringement. It is because we have, and need,\r\nmultiple exceptions and limitations on intellectual property\r\nthat the Supreme Court was able to resist the claim that\r\ncopyright itself forbids technologies of cheaper copying. To put\r\nit another way, without a robust set of exceptions and\r\nlimitations on copyright, the idea that cheaper copying requires\r\ngreater control will inexorably drive us toward the position\r\nthat the technologies of cheaper reproduction must be put under\r\nthe governance of copyright holders.\r\n61\r\n\r\nThus we have a corollary to the Jefferson Warning--call it the\r\nSony Axiom: cheaper copying makes the limitations on copyright\r\nmore rather than less important. Without those limitations,\r\ncopyright law will bloat and metastasize into a claim of\r\nmonopoly, or at least control, over the very architectures of\r\nour communications technology. And that is exactly where the\r\nlogic of the Internet Threat is taking us today.\r\n62\r\n\r\nFROM NAPSTER TO GROKSTER\r\n63\r\n\r\nSeventeen years after the Sony decision, another court had to\r\ndeal with a suit by outraged copyright holders against the\r\ncreators of a technology that allowed individuals to copy\r\nmaterial cheaply and easily. The suit was called A&M Records v.\r\nNapster.24 Napster was a \"peer-to-peer\" file sharing system. The\r\nfiles were not kept on some huge central server. Instead, there\r\nwas a central directory--think of a telephone directory--which\r\ncontained a constantly updated list of the addresses of\r\nindividual computers and the files they contained. Anyone who\r\nhad the software could query the central registry to find a\r\nfile's location and then establish a direct computer-to-computer\r\nconnection--anywhere in the world--with the person who had the\r\nfile they desired. This decentralized design meant the system\r\nwas extremely \"robust,\" very fast, and of nearly infinite\r\ncapacity. Using this technology, tens of millions of people\r\naround the world were \"sharing\" music, an activity which record\r\ncompanies quite understandably viewed as simple theft. In fact,\r\nit would be hard to think of a situation that illustrated the\r\nInternet Threat better. The case ended up in front of the U.S.\r\nCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which hears cases in an\r\narea that includes California and thus has decided a lot of\r\ncopyright cases over the years.\r\n64\r\n\r\nThere was an irony here. When the Supreme Court decided the Sony\r\ncase, it was on appeal from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\r\nSony, with its rule about reproductive technologies with\r\nsubstantial noninfringing uses, reversed the appeals court\r\ndecision. The Supreme Court was, in effect, telling the Ninth\r\nCircuit that it was wrong, that its ruling would have required\r\nthe \"extraordinary\" (legal shorthand for \"stupid\") conclusion\r\nthat copyright law gave copyright holders a veto on new\r\ntechnology. In the process, the Supreme Court told the Ninth\r\nCircuit that it also did not understand the law of fair use, or\r\nthe freedom that should be given to individuals to make\r\n\"noncommercial\" private copies. The identities of the judges had\r\nchanged, but now, seventeen years later, the same Circuit Court\r\nhad another high-profile case on exactly the same issues. In\r\ncase any of the judges might have missed this irony, it took\r\nDavid Boies, the lawyer for Napster, about ninety seconds to\r\nremind them in his oral argument. \"This court,\" he said, adding\r\nas if in afterthought, \"in the decision that the Supreme Court\r\nultimately reversed in Sony. . . .\"25 To the laypeople in the\r\naudience it probably just seemed like another piece of legal\r\ndroning. But to the lawyers in the room the message was quite\r\nclear. \"The last time you got a case about a major new\r\ntechnology of consumer reproduction, you really screwed it up.\r\nHope you can do better this time.\" The judges' mouths\r\nquirked--not entirely in pleasure. The point had been registered.\r\n65\r\n\r\nThink for a moment of the dilemma in which the court had been\r\nplaced. On the one hand, you had tens of millions of people\r\n\"sharing\" music files and Napster was the service that allowed\r\nthem to do it. If this was not contributory copyright\r\ninfringement, what was? On the other hand, Napster seemed to fit\r\nvery nicely under the rule announced in the Sony case.\r\n66\r\n\r\nThe argument went like this. Like the VCR, the Napster service\r\nhad substantial noninfringing uses. It allowed bands to expose\r\ntheir music to the world through the \"New Artists\" program. It\r\nmade it easy to share music which was no longer under copyright.\r\nThese uses clearly do not infringe copyright. There were also\r\nthe claims that it permitted \"space-shifting\" by consumers who\r\nalready owned the music or \"sampling\" of music by listeners as\r\nthey decided whether or not to buy. One could argue that space-\r\nshifting and sampling were fair use (though in the end the court\r\ndisagreed). But since we have two clear noninfringing uses, the\r\ntechnology obviously does have substantial uses that do not\r\nviolate copyright. Thus, Napster cannot be liable as a\r\ncontributory infringer, just as Sony could not be liable for the\r\nBetamax. Supreme Court precedent covers this case. The Ninth\r\nCircuit is bound by that precedent. All the judges can do, goes\r\nthe argument, is to apply the words of the rule laid down in\r\nSony, say that Napster wins, and move on to the next case. If\r\nCongress wants to make services like Napster illegal, it is\r\ngoing to have to pass a new law. The boundaries of the Sony rule\r\nare clear and Napster fits within them. (Of course, the last\r\npoint is subject to argument, but the argument for Napster on\r\nthis issue was a good one. Not overwhelming--there were more\r\nnoninfringing uses in the Sony case because the normal way\r\nconsumers used the technology in question was found to be a fair\r\nuse--but certainly powerful.)\r\n67\r\n\r\nA more daring strategy was to suggest that all the copying done\r\nover Napster was fair use, or at least presumptively fair. In\r\nSony, the Supreme Court had said that the law presumes that\r\nnoncommercial private copying--such as taping a show at home for\r\nfuture viewing--is a fair use. This presumption shifts the burden\r\nto the copyright holder to prove that the practice caused harm\r\nto them. Copying on Napster was done by private individuals. No\r\nmoney was exchanged. Does this mean we must presume it was fair\r\nuse and require the music companies and songwriters to show\r\nclear evidence of \"market harm\" if they want to convince us\r\notherwise?\r\n68\r\n\r\nIt sounds as though proving market harm would be pretty easy.\r\nHow could millions of people exchanging hundreds of millions of\r\nsongs not be causing harm? But it is more complicated. Remember\r\nthe Jefferson Warning. We are not talking about swiping shoes\r\nfrom a shoe store. There one merely has to show the theft to\r\nprove the loss. By contrast, music files are copied without\r\nbeing \"taken\" from their owner. The record companies would have\r\nto show harm to their market--the people downloading who do not\r\npurchase music because it is available for free. Those who\r\ndownload, but would not have purchased, do not count. And we\r\nhave to balance those who are deterred from purchasing against\r\nthose who purchase a whole CD because they are exposed to new\r\nmusic through Napster. One very interesting empirical study on\r\nthe subject indicates that the result is a wash, with hardly any\r\nmeasurable effect on sales; the overall drop in CD purchases\r\nresults from larger macroeconomic issues.26 This study, however,\r\nhas been subject to detailed methodological criticism.27 Another\r\nstudy shows a weak effect on sales, though rather woundingly it\r\nseems to suggest that the result is economically efficient--fewer\r\npeople end up with music they do not like.28 Other studies, by\r\ncontrast, support the record company position--suggesting that\r\nillicit file sharing does indeed undercut sales of both CDs and\r\nauthorized digital downloads.29 Given the complexities of the\r\nissue, the record companies did not want to engage in a war of\r\ndueling empirical studies.\r\n69\r\n\r\nSo, if Napster's users were not infringing copyright law in the\r\nfirst place--at least until the record companies came up with\r\nconvincing evidence of market harm--because their copying was\r\nnoncommercial, then Napster could hardly be guilty of\r\ncontributory infringement, could it? There would be no\r\ninfringement at all!\r\n70\r\n\r\nYou could see Mr. Boies's arguments as simple equations between\r\nthe cases.\r\n71\r\n\r\n*  Noninfringing uses such as recording public domain films and\r\n\"time-shifting\" programs are equivalent to noninfringing uses\r\nsuch as the New Artists program or sharing public domain music\r\n(and maybe \"space-shifting\" one's own music?); or\r\n*  Private noncommercial videotaping is equivalent to private\r\nnoncommercial file sharing. Both are presumptively fair uses.\r\n*  Either way, Sony=Napster and Napster wins.\r\n72\r\n\r\nNapster did not win, of course, though when the judges handed\r\ndown their decision it was clear they had been paying attention\r\nto Mr. Boies, at least enough to make them very wary of\r\ntampering with Sony. They claimed that they were upholding that\r\ncase, but that Napster could be liable anyway. How? Because\r\nthere was enough evidence here to show that the controllers of\r\nNapster had \"actual knowledge that specific infringing material\r\nis available using its system, that it could block access to the\r\nsystem by suppliers of the infringing material, and that it\r\nfailed to remove the material.\" There was indeed evidence that\r\nNapster knew how its system was being used--an embarrassing\r\namount of it, including early memos saying that users will want\r\nanonymity because they are trading in \"pirated music.\" Then\r\nthere were nasty circumstantial details, like the thousands of\r\ninfringing songs on the hard drive of one particular Napster\r\nemployee--the compliance officer tasked with enforcing the\r\nDigital Millennium Copyright Act! (The recording company lawyers\r\nwaxed wonderfully sarcastic about that.)\r\n73\r\n\r\nBut despite the ludicrously dirty hands of Napster as a company,\r\nlawyers could see that the appeals court was making a lot of new\r\nlaw as it struggled to find a way to uphold Sony while still\r\nmaking Napster liable. The court's ruling sounded reasonable and\r\nclear, something that would only strike at bad actors while\r\npaying heed to the Sony Axiom and the assurance of safety that\r\nthe rule in Sony had provided to technology developers for the\r\nprevious twenty years. But hard cases make bad law. In order to\r\naccomplish this piece of legal legerdemain, the court had to\r\nalter or reinterpret the law in ways that are disturbing.\r\n74\r\n\r\nThe first thing the court did was to reject the argument that\r\nthe \"sharing\" was private and noncommercial. As to the idea that\r\nit is not private, fair enough. Sharing one's music with fifty-\r\nfour million people does not sound that private, even if it is\r\ndone for private ends, in private spaces. What about\r\nnoncommercial? Embracing some earlier rulings on the subject,\r\nthe court said a use was \"commercial\" if you got for nothing\r\nsomething for which you would otherwise have to pay. On the\r\nsurface this sounds both clever and reasonable--a way to\r\ndifferentiate home taping from global file sharing--but the\r\nargument quickly begins to unravel. True, the Betamax owners\r\ncould get TV shows for free just by watching at the regular\r\ntime. But they could not get a copy of the show for free at the\r\nmoment they wanted to watch it. That was why they taped. One\r\ncould even argue that Napster users would have access to most\r\nsongs over the radio for free. But lawyers' quibbling about\r\nwhich way the rule cuts in this case is not the point. Instead,\r\nwe need to focus on the change in the definition of\r\n\"commercial,\" because it illustrates a wider shift.\r\n75\r\n\r\nRemember, a finding that a use is \"noncommercial\" makes it more\r\nlikely that a court will find it to be legal--to be a fair use.\r\nThe old test focused mainly on whether the motive for the\r\ncopying was to make money. (A different stage of the inquiry\r\nconcerned whether there was harm to the copyright holder's\r\nmarket.) The Napster court's test concentrates on whether the\r\nperson consuming the copy got something for free. Instead of\r\nfocusing on the fact that the person making the copy is not\r\nmaking money out of it--think of a professor making electronic\r\ncopies of articles for his students to download--it focuses on\r\nthe presumptively dirty hands of those who are \"getting\r\nsomething for nothing.\" But lots of copyright law is about\r\n\"getting something for nothing.\"\r\n76\r\n\r\nTo put it differently, one central goal of copyright is to limit\r\nthe monopoly given to the copyright owner so that he or she\r\ncannot force citizens to pay for every single type of use. The\r\ndesign of the law itself is supposed to facilitate that. When\r\n\"getting something for free\" comes to equal \"commercial\" in the\r\nanalysis of fair use, things are dangerously out of balance.\r\nThink back to Jefferson's analogy. If I light my candle at\r\nyours, am I getting fire for free, when otherwise I would have\r\nhad to pay for matches? Does that make it a \"commercial\" act?\r\n77\r\n\r\nHaving dismissed the claim that this was noncommercial sharing,\r\nthe court then reinterpreted the Sony decision to allow\r\nliability when there was \"actual knowledge\" of specific\r\ncopyright violations, an ability to block access by infringers,\r\nand a failure to do so. Neither side was entirely happy with\r\nthis ruling, but the record companies believed--rightly--that it\r\nwould allow them effectively to shut Napster down. Yet the\r\nNapster ruling only postponed the issue. The next set of file\r\nsharing services to be sued after Napster were even more\r\ndecentralized peer-to-peer systems; the Napster court's\r\nreinterpretation of Sony would not be able to reach them.\r\n78\r\n\r\nThe peer-to-peer file sharing service called Grokster is a\r\nrelatively typical example. Unlike Napster, Grokster had no\r\ncentral registry. The system was entirely run by the individual\r\n\"peer\" computers. Because the system was designed this way, the\r\npeople who made and distributed the software had no knowledge of\r\nspecific infringing files. The users were doing the searching,\r\nindexing, and storing, and Grokster had no ability to control\r\ntheir behavior. For those reasons, a court of appeals held that\r\nGrokster was not liable. As in Sony, the system had substantial\r\nnoninfringing uses. Lots of interesting content was traded on\r\nGrokster with the copyright holder's consent. Other material was\r\nin the public domain. Grokster made money by streaming\r\nadvertisements to the users of its software. The movie companies\r\nand record companies saw this as a flagrant, for-profit piracy\r\nring. Grokster's response was that like the makers of the VCR,\r\nit was simply providing a technology. Its financial interest was\r\nin people using that technology, not in using it for illicit\r\npurposes--though, like the VCR manufacturer, it would profit\r\neither way. The court of appeals agreed. True, the majority of\r\nthe material traded on Grokster was illicitly copied, but the\r\ncourt felt that it could not give the recording or movie\r\ncompanies control over a technology simply because it allowed\r\nfor easier copying, even if most of that copying was illegal. As\r\nI tried to point out in the section on the Sony Axiom, that line\r\nof thought leads to copyright holders having a veto over\r\ntechnological development.\r\n79\r\n\r\nIt was at this point that the Supreme Court stepped in. In the\r\ncase of MGM v. Grokster,30 the Supreme Court followed the line\r\nof the Napster court, but went even further. The Court created a\r\nnew type of contributory copyright infringement--while apparently\r\ndenying it was doing so. Grokster and its fellow services were\r\nliable because of three different kinds of evidence that they\r\nhad \"intended\" to induce copyright violation. First, they were\r\ntrying \"to satisfy a known demand for copyright infringement.\"\r\nThis could be shown by the way that they advertised themselves\r\nas alternatives to the \"notorious filesharing service, Napster.\"\r\nSecond, the file sharing services did not try to develop\r\nfiltering software to identify and eliminate copyrighted\r\ncontent--though this alone would not have been enough to make\r\nthem liable. Finally, their advertising-supported system clearly\r\nprofited by high-intensity use, which they knew was driven in\r\nthe most part by illicit copying. This too would not have been\r\nenough by itself, the Court added, but had to be seen in the\r\ncontext of the whole record of the case.\r\n80\r\n\r\nLet me be clear. I wept no tears for Napster, Grokster, and\r\ntheir ilk. I see no high-minded principle vindicated by middle-\r\nclass kids getting access to music they do not want to pay for.\r\nIt is difficult to take seriously the sanctimonious preening of\r\nthose who cast each junior downloader of corporate rock as a Ché\r\nGuevara, fighting heroically to bring about a new creative\r\nlandscape in music. (It is almost as hard to take seriously the\r\nrecord industry executives who moralistically denounce the\r\ndownloading in the name of the poor, suffering artists, when\r\nthey preside over a system of contracts with those same artists\r\nthat makes feudal indenture look benign.) The file sharing\r\ncompanies themselves were also pretty unappealing. Many of the\r\nservices were bloated with adware and spyware. True, some of\r\ntheir software engineers started with a dewy-eyed belief that\r\nthis was a revolutionary technology that would break the record\r\ncompanies and usher in a new era of musical creativity. Whether\r\none agrees or disagrees with them, it is hard--for me at least--to\r\ndoubt their sincerity. But even this quality did not last long.\r\nFor most of the people involved, the words \"stock options\"\r\nworked their normal, morally debilitating magic. In internal\r\ncompany correspondence, attacks on the hypocrisy of the music\r\ncompanies and defenses of a democratic communications structure\r\nimperceptibly gave way to discussions of \"customer base,\" \"user\r\nexperience,\" and \"saleable demographics.\" I care little that\r\nNapster and Grokster--as individual companies--lost their specific\r\nlegal battles. There are few heroes in this story. But if we had\r\nto rely on heroes, nothing would ever get done.\r\n81\r\n\r\nI do care about the technology behind Napster and Grokster--about\r\nthe kind of decentralized system it represents. I also care\r\nabout the principle I identified as the Sony Axiom--a principle\r\nthat goes far beyond music, peer-to-peer systems, or the\r\nInternet as a whole. The Supreme Court's decision in Grokster\r\ncould have been much worse. But it still offers a modest threat\r\nboth to that technology and to that axiom.\r\n82\r\n\r\nWhat is so great about peer-to-peer systems? We talk about\r\n\"cheap speech\" on the Internet, but bandwidth is actually\r\nexpensive. If one is talking about music or video files, and one\r\nwishes to speak to many people in a short period of time, one\r\nvital way to have cheap speech is over peer-to-peer networks. If\r\nmany of your viewers or listeners are willing to become\r\nbroadcasting stations as they watch, you can cheaply reach a\r\nmillion people in a short period of time with your video of\r\nabuse in Abu Ghraib or your parody of political leaders. You do\r\nnot need to rely on a broadcasting station, or even on the\r\ncontinued existence of entities such as YouTube, which face\r\ntheir own legal worries. By making your listeners your\r\ndistributors, you can quickly reach the same number of ears that\r\nthe payola-soaked radio waves allow the record companies to\r\nreach.\r\n83\r\n\r\nOne need not cheer Grokster. Much of what went on there was\r\nindeed illicit. But there are two key things to understand about\r\npeer-to-peer networks. The first is that they are hard to\r\npolice. They have multiple nodes. That is why they work. It\r\nmeans they will have both infringing and noninfringing uses, and\r\nthe noninfringing uses will be centrally connected to our\r\ndeepest values of free speech and cultural decentralization.\r\n84\r\n\r\nThe second feature of peer-to-peer networks is even more basic.\r\nThey are networks and thus subject to the laws of network\r\neconomics. In short, they only work well if many people use\r\nthem. A person who uses a peer-to-peer system that no one else\r\nuses is in the position of the person who owns the only fax\r\nmachine in the world. Peer-to-peer networks provide cheap and\r\nunregulable audiovisual or data-heavy \"speech\" to a mass\r\naudience. And if the past is any guide, those networks will also\r\ncarry large amounts of illicit material, just as photocopying\r\nmachines (and VCRs) are widely used to violate copyright. The\r\nGrokster case makes it harder, but not impossible, to have\r\nsuccessful, widely used peer-to-peer systems that are not\r\nthemselves illicit. If they are widely used, there will be\r\ninfringing content. If you try to police them and filter them,\r\nyou will know more about that infringing content and thus might\r\nbe liable--that was the point of the Napster case. If you do not,\r\nyou will be failing to take precautions. That was the point of\r\nthe Grokster case. What is a poor peer-to-peer network to do?\r\nApart from making sure that the last four letters of your\r\nservice's name are not \"-ster,\" I am hard-pressed to advise you.\r\n85\r\n\r\nA decision does not need to make an activity illegal in order to\r\nimpede it. It only needs to make it uncertain. Already, for\r\nexample, the free--and so far as I could tell, entirely well-\r\nmeaning--service \"bonpoo,\" which allowed you to send large file\r\nattachments to many people at once, has shut down all of its\r\ncapabilities except photo transfer. That is simply one trivial\r\ninstance of a larger harm. Lots of new communications\r\ntechnologies will remain undeveloped because of the\r\nuncertainties left by this ruling.\r\n86\r\n\r\nMy colleague Jennifer Jenkins gave one useful hyperbolic\r\nillustration, drawing on earlier work by the Electronic Frontier\r\nFoundation: if one were launching the iPod today, it is not\r\nclear how it would fare under Grokster's standard. Of course,\r\nthere is no danger that the iPod will be challenged. It has\r\nbecome respectable and the music companies ended up sanctioning\r\nit. But how does it fare if we simply apply the tests laid down\r\nin the Grokster case? There is Apple's \"tainted\" advertising\r\ncampaign, urging users to \"Rip, Mix, and Burn.\" Does this not\r\nsuggest complicity, or even intent? There is the fact that the\r\niPod does not restrict itself solely to proprietary formats\r\nprotected by digital rights management. It also allows\r\nuncontrolled MP3 files despite the fact that this format is\r\n\"notoriously\" used to transfer files against the wishes of the\r\ncopyright owner. This, surely, is a \"failure to police.\" And\r\nfinally, there is the fact that it would cost about $10,000 to\r\nfill an iPod with songs downloaded from iTunes. Clearly Apple\r\nmust be aware that much of the music that fills iPods is\r\nillicitly copied. They are profiting from that fact to drive\r\ndemand for the product, just as Grokster was profiting from the\r\nattractions of illicit traffic to drive people to use their\r\nservice!\r\n87\r\n\r\nNo one is going to sue Apple now, of course. In fact,\r\nestablished players in the marketplace are probably fairly safe\r\n(and have better lawyers). But what if a product as good as the\r\niPod were being developed now by some upstart company? What if\r\nit were no more and no less likely to be used for infringing\r\npurposes? Would the business plan ever see the light of day? Or\r\nwould it be quietly smothered due to legal uncertainty? I have\r\nlittle sympathy for Grokster the company, but the decision that\r\ndoomed it is a bad piece of technology policy.\r\n88\r\n\r\nThere is a second reason to dislike the Grokster decision.\r\nDespite some of the angst-ridden announcements made when the\r\ndecision was handed down, the Supreme Court has not killed peer-\r\nto-peer systems. The concept is far too well entrenched. But the\r\ndecision will mean that there are fewer of them that are widely\r\nused, easy to operate, and made by responsible and reputable\r\npeople you can trust. This will probably lessen, but not end,\r\nillicit copying online. But that effect comes with a price--it\r\nmakes our communications architecture a little bit more tightly\r\ncontrolled, reducing but not removing the availability of\r\nmethods of mass distribution that are entirely outside\r\ncentralized public or private control. It is another--relatively\r\nsmall--step toward an Internet that is more like cable TV or\r\niTunes, a one-way flow of approved content. One might decide\r\nthat such a price was well worth paying. But where is the\r\nlimiting principle or end point of the logic that led to it?\r\n89\r\n\r\nThere is no provision in U.S. statutory copyright law that\r\nimposes liability for contributory or vicarious infringement.\r\nNone. The patent statute has such a provision; not the Copyright\r\nAct. The courts have simply made the scheme up themselves. Then\r\nthey made up limitations--such as Sony--in order to rein it in. In\r\nGrokster, the Supreme Court went further. It made up a new type\r\nof \"inducement\" liability. Fine. As I have tried to indicate\r\nhere, the decision is not as dreadful as it is reputed to be.\r\nBut so long as there is any unregulated space in our\r\ncommunications network, some portion of it will have illicitly\r\ncopied content on it. The more the system is free of central\r\ncontrol, the more it is open to use by any citizen, the cheaper\r\nit gets--all very desirable characteristics--the more illicit\r\ncontent there will be. That is the premise of the Internet\r\nThreat--the belief that control must rise as copying costs fall.\r\nI have tried here to suggest an alternative interpretation, the\r\nSony Axiom: without a strong internal set of limitations over\r\ncopyright, cheaper copying and the logic of the Internet Threat\r\nwill always drive us toward giving control over our\r\ncommunications architecture to the content industries.\r\n90\r\n\r\nThere was one particularly striking moment in the Napster oral\r\nargument. The lawyer for the recording companies was arguing\r\nthat Napster was illegal. The judges interrupted, as they often\r\ndo, and there was a back-and-forth debate about the likely reach\r\nof any ruling that would shut down Napster. \"I am not trying to\r\nsay the Internet is illegal,\" said the lawyer. There was a pause\r\nas everyone weighed those words carefully.\r\n91\r\n\r\nMy response would be \"Really? Why not?\" The logic of the\r\nInternet Threat leads to the position that a network is either\r\ncontrolled or illegal. The better and cheaper the network, the\r\ntighter the control needed. The Internet itself could have been\r\ndesigned differently. There could have been more centralized\r\ncontrol, filtering of content, a design based on one-way\r\ntransmission, closed protocols that allow users only a limited\r\nnumber of options. Indeed there were such systems--the national\r\nFrench Minitel system is an example. The Internet represents the\r\nopposite set of choices--freedom from centralized control,\r\nabsence of intervention. In a famous article, Saltzer, Reed, and\r\nClark provided the argument that an \"end-to-end\" network that is\r\n\"dumb\" and leaves processing to the \"ends\"--the smart terminals\r\nat either end of the wires--will be stable and robust.31 But it\r\nwill also be remarkably uncontrolled and it will lower global\r\ncopying costs close to zero for digital content. It is that\r\nprinciple that has made it successful. To put it tersely: the\r\nlogic of the Internet Threat runs in exactly the opposite\r\ndirection to the Internet itself. The logic of control is not\r\nthe logic of the Net.\r\n92\r\n\r\nHere is one last thought experiment. Apply the same test I\r\nsuggested for the iPod to the Internet itself.32 Imagine you\r\nknew nothing of the Net. (Those of you who are over twenty-five\r\nmay actually be able to remember when you knew nothing of the\r\nNet.) Imagine that you are sitting in a room somewhere\r\ndiscussing--perhaps with a group of government bureaucrats or\r\nsome policy analysts from the Commerce Department--whether to\r\ndevelop this particular network. The scientists are\r\nenthusiastic. They talk of robustness and dumb networks with\r\nsmart terminals. They talk of TCP/IP and HTML and decentralized\r\nsystems that run on open protocols, so that anyone can connect\r\nto this network and use it any way they want to. You, of course,\r\nknow nothing about the truly astounding outburst of creativity\r\nand communication that would actually flower on such a system,\r\nthat would flower precisely because it is so open and no one\r\ncountry or company controls it or the protocols that run it. You\r\ndo not know that millions of people worldwide will assemble the\r\ngreatest factual reference work the world has ever seen on this\r\nnetwork--often providing their information for free out of some\r\nbizarre love of sharing. You do not know about Amazon.com or\r\nHotornot.com or the newspapers of the world online, or search\r\nengines, automatic page translation, plug-ins, or browsers. You\r\ncannot imagine free or open-source software being assembled by\r\nthousands of programmers worldwide. E-mail is only a dimly\r\nunderstood phenomenon to you. Teenagers in your world have never\r\nheard of instant messaging--a nostalgic thought.\r\n93\r\n\r\nAs the scientists talk, it becomes clear that they are\r\ndescribing a system without centralized direction or policing.\r\nImagine that your decision is framed by the logic of control I\r\nhave described in this chapter, by the fears that the content\r\nindustry has had for at least the last thirty years--by the logic\r\nof the suit they brought in Sony. Imagine, in other words, that\r\nwe make the up-or-down decision to develop the Internet based on\r\nthe values and fears that our copyright policy now exhibits, and\r\nthat the content industries have exhibited for thirty years.\r\nThere is no way, no way at all, that a network like it would\r\never be developed. It would be strangled at birth. You would be\r\ntold by the lawyers and policy wonks that it would be a haven\r\nfor piracy and illegality. (And it would be, of course--though it\r\nwould also be much, much more.) You would be told that the\r\nsystem needed to be designed to be safe for commerce or it would\r\nnever attract investment, that it would need to be controlled\r\nand centralized for it to be reliable, that it would need to be\r\nmonitored to stop it being a hotbed of crime. With the copyright\r\nlawyers in the room, you would end up designing something that\r\nlooked like cable TV or Minitel. The Internet would never get\r\noff the ground.\r\n94\r\n\r\nThe Internet is safe now, of course, because it developed so\r\nfast that it was a reality before people had time to be afraid\r\nof it. But it should give us pause that if we had our current\r\nguiding set of policy goals in place, our assumption that\r\ncheaper copying means we need greater regulation, we would never\r\nhave allowed it to flourish. As Jessica Litman points out, we\r\nare increasingly making our decisions about technology and\r\ncommunications policy inside copyright law. We are doing so\r\naccording to the logic of control that I have sketched out in\r\nthis chapter. But the logic of control is a partial logic. It\r\nblinds us to certain possibilities, ones that have huge and\r\nproven potential--look at the Internet.\r\n95\r\n\r\nThe law has not been entirely one-sided, however. The Sony case\r\ndrew a line in the sand which promised to halt the inevitable\r\ndrift toward greater and greater control over communications\r\ntechnology by content owners. It turned out the heavens did not\r\nfall. Indeed, the content companies thrived. Perhaps that line\r\nwas drawn in the wrong place; reasonable people can disagree\r\nabout that. But Grokster smudges the line without drawing a\r\nclear new one. If that new line is drawn according to the logic\r\nof control, what technologies will we never see? Could they be\r\ntechnologies that would transform our lives as unimaginably as\r\nthe Internet has since 1995?\r\n96\r\n\r\nI have described the story line--the cluster of metaphors and\r\nimages and concerns--that pervades our copyright policy. I\r\nlabeled it \"the Internet Threat.\" In the next chapter, I discuss\r\nan alternative story line, a different way of understanding our\r\ncurrent policies. The subject of that story line is the best-\r\nknown example of contemporary attempts to control the digital\r\nworld, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act or DMCA.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 5: The Farmers' Tale: An Allegory\r\n1\r\n\r\nImagine that a bustling group of colonists has just moved into a\r\nnew area, a huge, unexplored plain. (Again, assume the native\r\ninhabitants have conveniently disappeared.) Some of the\r\ncolonists want to farm just as they always did in the old\r\ncountry. \"Good fences make good neighbors\" is their motto.\r\nOthers, inspired by the wide-open spaces around them, declare\r\nthat this new land needs new ways. They want to let their cattle\r\nroam as they will; their slogan is \"Protect the open range.\" In\r\npractice, the eventual result is a mixture of the two regimes.\r\nFields under cultivation can be walled off but there is a right\r\nof passage through the farmers' lands for all who want it, so\r\nlong as no damage is done. This means travelers do not need to\r\nmake costly and inefficient detours around each farm. In the\r\nlong run, these \"public roads\" actually increase the value of\r\nthe private property through which they pass. They also let the\r\nranchers move their cattle around from one area of pasture to\r\nanother. The ranchers become strong proponents of \"public, open\r\nhighways\" (though some people muse darkly that they do very well\r\nout of that rule). Still, most people want open highways; the\r\nsystem seems to work pretty well, in fact.\r\n2\r\n\r\nTwo new technologies are introduced. First, the automobile is\r\ndeveloped. Now thieves can drive through the farmers' fields,\r\nstop quickly to grab some corn or a lettuce, and be back on the\r\nhighway before they can be caught. Of course, the farmers' costs\r\nhave also fallen dramatically; now they have tractors to work\r\ntheir fields and trucks to take their products to distant\r\nmarkets. The farmers do not dwell on the benefits of the new\r\ntechnology, however. Understandably, they focus more on the\r\nprofits they could reap if they could get all the advantages of\r\nthe technology and none of its costs. They demand new legal\r\nprotections aimed at producing that result. \"What's good for\r\nagriculture is good for the nation,\" they say. But now comes the\r\nsecond technological shock--the development of barbed wire. The\r\ncost of erecting impassable barriers falls dramatically. The\r\nfarmers begin to see the possibility of enclosing all of their\r\nland, roads and fields alike. This will help them protect their\r\ncrops from pilfering, but it will also allow them to charge\r\npeople for opening the gates in their fences--even the gates on\r\npublic roads. That is a nice extra revenue stream which will,\r\nthe farmers say, \"help encourage agriculture.\" After all, more\r\nfences mean more money for farmers, and more money for farmers\r\nmeans they can invest in new methods of farming, which will mean\r\neveryone is better off, right?\r\n3\r\n\r\nWhat is to be done? Assume that each side presents its case to\r\nthe legislature. There are three obvious possibilities:\r\n4\r\n\r\nFirst, the legislature can simply tell each side to work it out\r\namongst themselves. The law will continue to forbid trespass,\r\nbut we are neither going to make it a crime to put up a barbed\r\nwire fence if it blocks legitimate public rights of way nor to\r\nmake it a crime to cut a barbed wire fence, unless the fence\r\ncutter is also a trespasser. The farmers can attempt to enclose\r\nland by putting barbed wire around it. Ranchers and drivers can\r\nlegally cut those fences when they are blocking public rights of\r\nway. Trespass remains trespass, nothing more.\r\n5\r\n\r\nSecond, the legislature could heed the ranchers' fears that\r\nbarbed wire will permit the farmers not only to protect their\r\nown land, but to rob the public of its existing rights of way,\r\nturning open highways into toll roads. (The ranchers, of course,\r\nare more concerned with the rights of cattle than people, but\r\nmost drivers agree with them.) As a result, the state could\r\nforbid the erection of a barbed wire fence where it might block\r\na public right of way--classing it as a kind of theft, perhaps.\r\n6\r\n\r\nThird, the legislature could take the farmers' side. Theorizing\r\nthat this new automobile technology presents \"a terrible threat\r\nto agriculture, because of rampant crop piracy,\" the state could\r\ngo beyond the existing law of trespass and make it a crime to\r\ncut barbed wire fences wherever you find them (even if the\r\nfences are enclosing public lands as well as private, or\r\nblocking public roads). To back up its command, it could get\r\ninto the technology regulation business--making the manufacture\r\nor possession of wire cutters illegal.\r\n7\r\n\r\nThe state picks option three. Wire cutting becomes a crime, wire\r\ncutters are classed with lock picks and other \"criminals'\r\ntools,\" and the people who make wire cutters are told their\r\nbusiness is illegal. A storm of protest arises in the rural\r\ndriving community. The wire cutter manufacturers claim that\r\ntheir products have lots of legitimate uses. All to no avail:\r\nthe farmers press on. They have two new demands. Cars should be\r\nfitted with mandatory radio beacons and highways put under\r\nconstant state surveillance in order to deter crop theft. In\r\naddition, car trunks should be redesigned so they can hold\r\nless--just in case the owner plans to load them up with purloined\r\nproduce. Civil libertarians unite with car manufacturers to\r\nattack the plan. The farmers declare that the car manufacturers\r\nare only interested in making money from potential thieves and\r\nthat the civil libertarians are Nervous Nellies: no one has\r\nanything to fear except the criminals. \"What's good for\r\nagriculture is good for the nation,\" they announce again. As the\r\nbarbed wire gates swing shut across the highways of the region,\r\nthe legislature heads back into session.\r\n8\r\n\r\nBETWEEN PARANOIA\r\nAND REALITY: THE DMCA\r\n9\r\n\r\nI have argued that confusing intellectual property with physical\r\nproperty is dangerous. I stand by that argument. Yet analogies\r\nto physical property are powerful. It is inevitable that we\r\nattempt to explain new phenomena by comparing them to material\r\nwith which we are more familiar. While the content companies'\r\ntales of \"theft\" and \"piracy\" are the most prevalent, they are\r\nby no means the only such analogy one can make. In this chapter\r\nI try to prove that point.\r\n10\r\n\r\nThe Farmers' Tale is my allegorical attempt to explain the\r\nstruggle over the single most controversial piece of\r\nintellectual property legislation in recent years, the Digital\r\nMillennium Copyright Act, or DMCA.1 The DMCA did many things,\r\nbut for our purposes its crucial provisions are those forbidding\r\nthe \"circumvention of copyright protection systems,\" the\r\ntechnological measures that copyright holders can use to deny\r\naccess to their works or control our behavior once we get\r\naccess. These measures include encryption, controls on how many\r\ntimes a file can be copied, password protection, and so on.\r\nCopyright protection systems are, in other words, the digital\r\nequivalent of barbed wire, used to add an additional layer of\r\n\"physical\" protection to the property owner's existing legal\r\nprotection. But, unlike barbed wire, they can also control what\r\nwe do once we get access to the property.\r\n11\r\n\r\nThe rules that forbid circumvention of these systems are\r\nlogically, if not elegantly, referred to as the\r\nanticircumvention provisions. They are to be found in Section\r\n1201 of the Copyright Act, an ungainly and lumpily written\r\nportion of the law that was inserted in 1998 as part of the\r\ncomplex set of amendments collectively referred to as the DMCA.\r\nI will explain the significance of these rules in a moment. My\r\nhope is that the analogy to the Farmers' Tale will make them a\r\nlittle easier to understand--at least for those of you for whom\r\ntalk of digital rights management, anticircumvention provisions,\r\nand network effects is not second nature.\r\n12\r\n\r\nNotice the differences between this allegory and the \"Internet\r\nThreat\" story line I described in the last chapter. There are\r\ntwo sets of bad guys in the Farmers' Tale. The greedy thieves\r\n(who are still thieves in this story--not heroes) and the greedy\r\nfarmers who use a genuine if indefinite \"threat\" posed by a new\r\ntechnology to mask a power grab. The Internet Threat is the\r\nstory of an industry devastated by piracy, in desperate need of\r\nhelp from the state to protect its legitimate property\r\ninterests. By contrast, the Farmers' Tale is the story of a\r\nself-interested attempt not only to protect property but to cut\r\noff recognized rights of public access in a way that will\r\nactually make the whole society worse off. The legitimate role\r\nof the state in protecting private property has been stretched\r\ninto an attempt to regulate technology so as to pick winners in\r\nthe marketplace, enriching the farmers at the expense of\r\nconsumers and other businesses. In the long run this will not be\r\ngood for business as a whole. A patchwork of private toll roads\r\nis an economic nightmare.\r\n13\r\n\r\nThat is not the most worrying part of the story: the farmers'\r\nproposals are moving in the direction of regulating still more\r\ntechnology--the mandatory radio beacons and constantly monitored\r\nroads conjure up a police state--and all to protect a bunch of\r\nhysterical vegetable growers whose political clout far outweighs\r\ntheir actual economic importance.\r\n14\r\n\r\nBoth the Internet Threat and the Farmers' Tale are, of course,\r\nways to understand what is currently going on in the\r\nintellectual property wars. In the digital realm, the part of\r\nthe farmers is played by the content companies, the recording\r\nindustry associations, the movie and software trade groups.\r\nPointing to the threat of digital piracy, they demanded and\r\nreceived extra legal protection for their copyrighted content.\r\nUnlike earlier expansions--longer copyright terms, more stringent\r\npenalties, the shrinking of exceptions and limitations,\r\nexpansions in copyrightable subject matter--this was not a\r\nprotection of the work itself; it was a protection of the\r\ndigital fences wrapped around it, and a regulation of the\r\ntechnology that might threaten those fences.\r\n15\r\n\r\nWhat is the significance of this? The digital revolution makes\r\nit easier to copy copyrighted content. It also makes it easier\r\nto protect that content, and to do so in a more granular and\r\nprecisely calibrated way. Imagine being able to sell a paperback\r\nbook that could only be read by the original purchaser or a song\r\nthat could only be listened to by a particular person in a\r\nparticular room. Digital rights management technology makes it a\r\nlot easier to do these things. Suddenly the copyright owners\r\nhave considerable physical control over their songs, e-books,\r\nand software, even after they have sold them. It is as if the\r\nrecording industry or the publishers had a representative in\r\nyour living room. They can use that control not merely to\r\nprevent illicit copying but to control and limit usage in ways\r\nthat go far beyond their exclusive rights under copyright. All\r\nof this happens without the law or the state doing anything.\r\nLike barbed wire, this is a technological protection measure.\r\n16\r\n\r\nLike the farmers, the content companies were not content with\r\ntheir barbed wire alone. They wanted legally protected barbed\r\nwire in addition to their existing legal rights under copyright.\r\nUnder the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, it became illegal to\r\ncircumvent a technical protection measure such as encryption--the\r\ndigital barbed wire behind which content companies secrete their\r\nwork--even if what you did with the content when you got past the\r\nbarbed wire was a fair use; excerpting a fragment of a film for\r\na school presentation, for example, or making a copy of an\r\nencrypted audio file for personal use in another device. In\r\nother words, by using digital barbed wire, the content companies\r\ncould prevent citizens from making the \"fair uses\" the copyright\r\nlaw allowed. This undermines some of the limitations on their\r\nexclusive rights that the Copyright Act explicitly carves out in\r\nSection 107, and thus shifts the balance of power that the\r\nCopyright Act establishes. Cutting barbed wire became a civil\r\nwrong, and perhaps a crime, even if the wire blocked a public\r\nroad. Under most circumstances, making wire cutters was also now\r\nagainst the law.\r\n17\r\n\r\nThe ranchers--whose digital equivalents are communications\r\ncompanies and hardware manufacturers--chafed under these new\r\nrules. The most powerful groups managed to get special\r\ndispensations. Internet service providers, for example, got a\r\nqualified immunity from copyright infringement that occurs over\r\ntheir networks. But ordinary citizens, librarians, and civil\r\nlibertarians also complained, and they were not as well\r\nrepresented in the legislature. It is true that the new rules\r\nmay help to prevent illicit copying, but they also strike a blow\r\nagainst the exercise of fair use rights--rights that are\r\nimportant both to free speech and competition. Even if the\r\ncontent companies were absolutely right about the threats from\r\ndigital piracy, this consequence should make us pause. But\r\ncritics of the DMCA say that there is little evidence that the\r\ncontent companies are right. They quote some of the empirical\r\nstudies I mentioned in the last chapter, particularly the ones\r\nthat show no net negative effect from unauthorized music\r\ndownloading on CD sales. They claim--and they are on strong\r\nground here--that even if there are some losses from the new\r\ncopying technologies, there are also benefits. Like the farmers,\r\nthe critics would argue, the content companies take the benefits\r\nof the new technology for granted, but wish the law to step in\r\nto ameliorate the harms it also creates. And like the farmers,\r\nthey are not yet satisfied. Their new proposals go even\r\nfurther--scarily further. Thus runs the critics' argument.\r\n18\r\n\r\nThe critics of the DMCA conjure up a world in which it will be\r\nillegal to lend each other books or songs, where it will be\r\nimpossible for us to copy even small fragments of digital work\r\nfor criticism or parody, where encryption research will be\r\nseverely \"chilled,\" and where large quantities of the public\r\ndomain will be enclosed together with the copyrighted content\r\nthat the DMCA is supposed to protect. (The Electronic Frontier\r\nFoundation's \"Unintended Consequences\" studies give concrete\r\nexamples.)2 They think the DMCA undoes the balance at the heart\r\nof copyright law, that it can be used to entrench existing\r\nbusinesses and their business methods, that it threatens speech,\r\ncompetition, privacy, and innovation itself. In short, they\r\nthink the DMCA is the worst intellectual property law Congress\r\nhas ever passed and view the adoption of similar laws around the\r\nworld with a reaction little short of horror.\r\n19\r\n\r\nThose who supported the DMCA disagree, of course, and do so\r\nhonestly. They see rampant piracy as a reality and the threat to\r\nfair use as some kind of academic hypothetical rarely\r\nencountered in reality. What's more, many of them do not think\r\nfair use is that important economically or culturally. If\r\nmarkets work well, users could be made to pay for the rights\r\nthat fair use gives--but only if they wanted them. One could buy\r\nexpensive digital books which one was allowed to share, quote,\r\nor copy for classroom use, and cheaper ones which one had to\r\nkeep to oneself. Remember that for many of the people who\r\nsupported the DMCA, fair use is something of a \"loophole\";\r\ncertainly not an affirmative right of the public or a reserved\r\nlimitation on the original property grant from the state.\r\n(Remember the Sony Axiom from Chapter 4?) They find the analogy\r\nof fair use to a public road ludicrous. This film, or book, or\r\nsong, is mine; anything you do with it, or to it, you do at my\r\nsufferance. (Remember the Jefferson Warning from Chapter 2?)\r\n20\r\n\r\nHow has the DMCA worked in reality? Which group's attitudes were\r\nvindicated? Two case studies may help us to answer these\r\nquestions.\r\n21\r\n\r\nInfectious Speech: The DMCA\r\nand Freedom of Expression\r\n22\r\n\r\nJon Johansen, a 16-year-old Norwegian, was the unwitting\r\ncatalyst for one of the most important cases interpreting the\r\nDMCA. He and two anonymous helpers wrote a program called DeCSS.\r\nDepending on whom you listen to, DeCSS is described either as a\r\nway of allowing people who use Linux or other open source\r\noperating systems to play DVDs on their computers, or as a tool\r\nfor piracy that threatened the entire movie industry and\r\nviolated the DMCA.\r\n23\r\n\r\nA little background is in order. When you play a commercial DVD,\r\nyour actions are partly controlled by a simple encryption scheme\r\ncalled CSS, or the Content Scramble System. The DVD Copy Control\r\nAssociation licenses the keys to this encryption system to the\r\nmanufacturers of DVD players. Without a key, most DVDs could not\r\nbe played. The manufacturer then embeds this key in its hardware\r\ndesign in such a way that it is easy for your player to decode\r\nand play the movie but hard, at least for a person of average\r\ntechnical competence, to copy the decoded \"stream.\"\r\n24\r\n\r\nBecause the DVD Copy Control Association will only license keys\r\nto manufacturers whose DVD players conform exactly to their\r\nspecifications, the CSS scheme can also be used to control\r\nviewers in other ways. For example, DVD players are required to\r\nhave one of six \"region codes,\" depending on where in the world\r\nthey are sold. Region 1 is the United States and Canada. Region\r\n2 is Japan, Europe, South Africa, the Middle East,\r\nand--bizarrely--Greenland. Region 3 is South Korea, Taiwan, and\r\nHong Kong; and so on. The CSS scheme can be used to restrict a\r\nmovie to a player with the appropriate region code. If you try\r\nto play a movie coded for region 6 (China) in a DVD player from\r\nregion 1, it will not play. This allows filmmakers to distribute\r\ndifferent versions of films to different regions at different\r\ntimes based on sequential release in cinemas, or simply to\r\ndistribute DVDs with different prices to different regions\r\nwithout worrying about whether the cheaper DVDs will \"leak\" into\r\nthe more lucrative markets. CSS and the hardware scheme that\r\nunlocks it can also be used to prevent you from fast-forwarding\r\nthrough the commercials at the beginning of the movie if the\r\ncopyright owner does not want you to, or from skipping the FBI\r\nnotice. The machine will not do it. In fact, it is deliberately\r\nbuilt so that it cannot do it.\r\n25\r\n\r\nWhat we have here is a digital fence that is partly used to\r\nprevent copying. Movie studios are understandably worried about\r\nthe worldwide circulation of perfect digital copies of their\r\nmovies. CSS was supposed to help to prevent that, or at least\r\nmake it much harder. But because almost all movies are encrypted\r\nwith CSS and access to the keys comes with conditions, CSS also\r\nallows a more fine-grained control over consumers. Manufacturers\r\nare not allowed to make players which can view movies from all\r\nregion codes or skip portions of the DVD that the owners do not\r\nwant you to skip. The licensing body puts it this way on its Web\r\nsite: \"Q. Under the terms of the CSS licensing agreement, is it\r\nlegal for a licensed manufacturer to produce and sell a product\r\nwhich allows a user to disable any CSS protections? A. No. Such\r\nproducts are not allowed under the terms of the CSS license.\r\nThey are illegal.\"3 A technology introduced to protect\r\nintellectual property rights allows control in ways that those\r\nrights alone do not.\r\n26\r\n\r\nBefore the DMCA, the movie companies could have done exactly\r\nthis. They could have wrapped their movies in a digital fence.\r\nThe consumer electronics companies that wanted to could license\r\na key and be allowed to use a trademark that indicated that they\r\nwere approved by the DVD Copy Control Association. But what if a\r\nmanufacturer of DVD players felt that American consumers wanted\r\nto be able to play their Japanese anime movies without buying\r\nanother DVD player to do so? Or what if they thought people were\r\nantsy and did not want to watch the FBI notice before every\r\nfilm? The manufacturer could have tried to \"reverse engineer\"\r\nthe CSS system, to figure out how it worked. If they succeeded,\r\nthey could make a player that was free of the restrictions that\r\nthe CSS licensing authority imposed.\r\n27\r\n\r\nOf course there were some legal limitations even before the\r\nDMCA. Our hypothetical manufacturer could not break into the\r\nsafe where the CSS code was being held or bribe an employee to\r\nprovide it. (That would be a trespass or a violation of trade\r\nsecret law.) It could not violate copyright laws over the\r\nvarious types of software that controlled DVD players. It could\r\nnot use the trademarks of any of the entities involved,\r\nincluding any seal of approval granted by the DVD Copy Control\r\nAssociation. But it could--at least in the United States--try to\r\nreverse engineer the product so as to make a competing product\r\nwith features that the customers liked more. It would be no more\r\nillegal than a company making a cheaper generic razor cartridge\r\nthat fits my expensive Gillette Mach 3 razor, a generic printer\r\ncartridge to replace the expensive one in my Lexmark printer,\r\nor, for that matter, a generic remote control for my garage door\r\nopener. In each case, of course, the original manufacturer would\r\nprefer that I use their products rather than the unlicensed\r\nones. They can design their product to make it hard to use a\r\ngeneric replacement or even tell me that my warranty will be\r\nvoid if I use one. But they cannot say that the unlicensed\r\nproduct is illegal. We are back in option one of the Farmers'\r\nTale, before the legislature acted. The farmers can put up their\r\nwire, and even use it to block passage that would be otherwise\r\nlegal, but it is not a crime to figure out a way through the\r\nfence unless the fence cutter is also a trespasser. The DMCA,\r\nhowever, might have changed all of that.\r\n28\r\n\r\nLet us return to Mr. Johansen, the 16-year-old Norwegian. He and\r\nhis two anonymous collaborators claimed that they were affected\r\nby another limitation imposed by the CSS licensing body. At that\r\ntime, there was no way to play DVDs on a computer running Linux,\r\nor any other free or open source operating system. (I will talk\r\nmore about free and open source software later.) Let's say you\r\nbuy a laptop. A Sony Vaio running Windows, for example. It has a\r\nslot in the side for DVDs to slide in and software that comes\r\nalong with it which allows the DVD reader to decode and play the\r\ndisk. The people who wrote the software have been licensed by\r\nthe DVD Copy Control Association and provided with a CSS key.\r\nBut at the time Mr. Johansen set out to create DeCSS, the\r\nlicensing body had not licensed keys to any free or open source\r\nsoftware developers. Say Mr. Johansen buys the Sony Vaio, but\r\nwith the Linux operating system on it instead of Windows. The\r\ncomputer is the same. The little slot is still there. Writing an\r\nopen source program to control the DVD player is trivial. But\r\nwithout the CSS key, there is no way for the player to decode\r\nand play the movie. (The licensing authority later did license\r\nan open source player, perhaps because they realized its\r\nunavailability gave Mr. Johansen a strong defense, perhaps\r\nbecause they feared an antitrust suit, or perhaps because they\r\njust got around to it.)\r\n29\r\n\r\nMr. Johansen and his supporters claimed strenuously that DeCSS\r\nwas not in fact an aid to illicit copying. In fact, they argued\r\nthat CSS was not really designed to protect DVDs against illicit\r\ncopying. Commercial DVD \"pirates\" do not need to crack the CSS\r\nencryption. Quite the contrary: they produce exact copies of the\r\nDVD, CSS encryption and all, and the buyer's player dutifully\r\ndecodes it and plays it. Mr. Johansen claimed that his goals\r\nwere very different from those of the pirates.\r\n30\r\n\r\n    The motivation was being able to play DVDs the way we want\r\nto. I don't like being forced to use a specific operating system\r\nor a specific player to watch movies (or listen to music). Nor\r\ndo I like being forced to watch commercials. When your DVD\r\nplayer tells you \"This operation is not allowed\" when you try to\r\nskip commercials, it becomes pretty clear that DRM really stands\r\nfor Digital Restrictions Management.4\r\n31\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Johansen's view, CSS was simply an attempt to control\r\nconsumers, an attempt which should be a valid target for legal\r\nreverse engineering. He has a point. There were indeed other\r\nways to copy DVDs which did not require DeCSS and which gave you\r\nfiles of more manageable size. CSS was indeed more than a simple\r\nanticopying device. The entire scheme--the keys, the licenses,\r\nthe hardware requirements--was designed to give movie studios\r\ngreater control over their movies in a number of ways, some of\r\nthem unrelated to copying. On the other hand, he overstated the\r\npoint. One function of CSS was indeed to make it harder for the\r\naverage person playing a DVD on a computer to copy the file from\r\nthe DVD to her hard disk and give it to a friend. It is very\r\neasy for the average 14-year-old to take a commercial music CD,\r\nchange the songs into smaller files in the MP3 format, and share\r\nthem with a friend. It is not as easy to do the same thing to a\r\nDVD--not impossible, just harder--and CSS is one of the reasons\r\nwhy.\r\n32\r\n\r\nMr. Johansen's program, DeCSS, was quickly made available\r\nworldwide. Mirror sites provided copies of the program and lists\r\nof such locations were easy to find using standard search tools.\r\nOne such list was provided by the online site run by a magazine\r\ncalled 2600: The Hacker Quarterly. The magazine features\r\neverything from pictures of pay phones from around the world to\r\ntips on how to hack into computer or telephone systems. Its\r\npublisher is one Eric Corley, who goes by the name Emmanuel\r\nGoldstein--the resistance leader in George Orwell's 1984.\r\n33\r\n\r\nIn 1999, Universal City Studios brought suit against a number of\r\nindividuals for distributing DeCSS. The case was called\r\nUniversal City Studios v. Reimerdes et al. Corley was among the\r\ndefendants. The suit prominently included a claim that the\r\ndefendants were violating the DMCA. It was in this case that the\r\nDMCA received its first major legal challenge.\r\n34\r\n\r\nDepending on the characterization of the facts, the case seems\r\nto be about very different things. It could seem a classic First\r\nAmendment fight. (\"Plucky magazine publisher told copyright law\r\nforbids him from linking to other sites on the Internet!\") Or it\r\ncould seem the very essence of illegal activity. (\"Shadowy site\r\nwhich unashamedly caters to computer 'hackers' tries to spread\r\naccess to the burglar's tools of cyberspace!\")\r\n35\r\n\r\nOf course, most lawsuits involve conflicts over facts. Much of\r\nwhat lawyers do is put the same facts into different conceptual\r\nboxes. But here, merely describing what Corley does, what\r\nhackers are, or what 2600 magazine is all about involves one in\r\na profound culture clash. The best way to capture the clash may\r\nbe to quote from an early entry about Corley in Wikipedia, the\r\nremarkable online encyclopedia.\r\n36\r\n\r\nThe encyclopedia first quotes the description of 2600 magazine\r\nfrom Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, the federal district court judge who\r\ndecided the Reimerdes case.\r\n37\r\n\r\n    \"2600: The Hacker Quarterly has included articles on such\r\ntopics as how to steal an Internet domain name, how to write\r\nmore secure ASP code, access other people's e-mail, secure your\r\nLinux box, intercept cellular phone calls, how to put Linux on\r\nan Xbox, how to remove spyware, and break into the computer\r\nsystems at Costco stores and Federal Express. One issue contains\r\na guide to the federal criminal justice system for readers\r\ncharged with computer hacking. In addition, 2600 operates a web\r\nsite located at 2600.com (http://www.2600.com), which is managed\r\nprimarily by Mr. Corley and has been in existence since 1995.\"\r\n38\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wikipedia article then continues as follows:\r\n39\r\n\r\n    While the judge's tone is clearly disapproving, others would\r\npoint out that bookstores, movies and television channels are\r\nfilled with material on how to commit murder . . . and that\r\nwithout the efforts of the hacker community, however\r\nillintentioned, computer insecurity would be even more of a\r\nproblem than it already is.5\r\n40\r\n\r\nIn fact, Judge Kaplan was not entirely disapproving. He mentions\r\narticles in 2600 that cover laudable or innocuous tasks, as well\r\nas others about tasks that most readers would find objectionable\r\nand rightly think to be illegal. But the anonymous volunteer who\r\nwrote this version of Corley's Wikipedia entry clearly saw the\r\nissue differently. Wikipedia does not portray the hacker\r\ncommunity as universally benevolent (\"however ill-intentioned\"),\r\nbut that community is also seen as providing a useful service\r\nrather than merely a set of how-to guides for would-be digital\r\nburglars.\r\n41\r\n\r\nTo most people, pointing out vulnerabilities in computer\r\nsecurity systems seemed, at least in 1999, like telling the\r\nworld that your neighbor has forgotten to lock his door and all\r\nhis possessions are there for the taking. But to the online\r\ncommunity, it is by no means so clear. From the perspective of\r\nthose who are knowledgeable in the field, there is a moral\r\ncontinuum. There is clearly legitimate computer security and\r\ncryptography research, which includes attempts to break into\r\ncomputer systems to test their defenses--that is how one finds\r\nout they are secure, after all. Then there are \"hackers.\" This\r\nterm could be used to describe those who merely like to program.\r\nRichard Stallman, for example, the originator of the free\r\nsoftware movement, describes himself thus. But the term could\r\nalso be used for those who are interested in security or\r\ninteroperability--making two systems work together. That was Mr.\r\nJohansen's declared goal, after all. But some self-described\r\nhackers go further. They believe that exploring and disclosing\r\nthe weaknesses of supposedly secure systems is intellectually\r\nfulfilling, practically important, and protected by the First\r\nAmendment. They disclaim both moral and legal responsibility for\r\nthe consequences of their disclosures. (Or at least the negative\r\nconsequences; they frequently take credit for the positive\r\nconsequences, such as improved security.) Finally, there are\r\n\"crackers,\" whose interest in gaining entry to computer systems\r\nis malicious or for financial gain. At what point on this\r\ncontinuum does the activity become legally, or morally,\r\nunacceptable? As the Reimerdes trial went on, it became clear\r\nthat the answer the DMCA gave might not be the same as the one\r\ngiven even by undeniably legitimate computer scientists.\r\n42\r\n\r\nA large number of legal arguments were involved in the Reimerdes\r\ncase, but for our purposes here the most important ones dealt\r\nwith the relationship between copyright and the First Amendment.\r\nWhat is that relationship?\r\n43\r\n\r\nIn one obvious sense copyright actually aids free speech. By\r\nproviding an incentive to create works, copyright \"add[s] the\r\nfuel of interest to the fire of genius,\"6 and thus helps to\r\ncreate the system of decentralized creative production and\r\ndistribution I described in Chapter 1. But copyright also\r\nrestrains speech. At its base, it allows an individual to call\r\nupon the state to prevent someone from speaking or expressing\r\nthemselves in a particular way. This may involve a simple\r\nrefusal to let the speaker use some text, picture, verse, or\r\nstory in their message, or it may involve a refusal to let them\r\ntransform it in some way.\r\n44\r\n\r\nNeither copyright law nor the American Constitution is blind to\r\nthese dangers. Copyright has a number of built-in safeguards.\r\nThe most important of these is that copyright only covers\r\n\"original expression\"--both the ideas and facts in this book can\r\nbe used by anyone without my permission. Thus, goes the theory,\r\nthe speaker's freedom of expression is never truly restrained.\r\nThe only thing I am barred from is using your words, your exact\r\nplot, your photograph, your music--not your facts, your ideas,\r\nyour genre, the events you describe.\r\n45\r\n\r\nThat is not always enough, of course. Sometimes the problem is\r\nthat the speaker cannot paraphrase around the restraints posed\r\nby copyright. He needs to use the particular text or image in\r\nquestion to convey his message. The ideas, the facts, or a mere\r\nparaphrase of the expression would not be enough. In cases like\r\nthat copyright's answer is \"fair use.\" A politician could not\r\nprevent journalists who disagree with him from quoting his\r\nautobiography in discussing his life. If an African-American\r\nauthor wishes to tell the story of Gone With the Wind from the\r\nslaves' perspective, she may do so in the face of the copyright\r\nholders' attempts to stop her. Even fair use, though, may not\r\ncover every concern about free expression. Before World War II,\r\nAlan Cranston--later a U.S. Senator--wanted to convince American\r\nreaders that the version of Hitler's Mein Kampf published in the\r\nUnited States was distorted. He believed it to be slanted toward\r\nAmerican sensibilities, downplaying both anti-Semitism and\r\nGerman expansionism. His solution? To publish his own English\r\ntranslation, taken direct and uncut from the German edition. He\r\nwanted to prove, with Hitler's own words, that the United States\r\nhad a dangerously distorted version of the German leader. But\r\nthis is the kind of thing copyright law forbids and it is not\r\nclear that fair use allows. (In the end he did it anyway.)7\r\n46\r\n\r\nFor the moment though, it is enough to realize that copyright\r\nlaw is not immune from the First Amendment or from free speech\r\nconcerns more generally. If we do not notice that most of the\r\ntime, it is because the internal limitations of copyright--fair\r\nuse, the idea-expression distinction, and so on--generally take\r\ncare of the First Amendment issue, not because the issue was\r\nnever there.\r\n47\r\n\r\nSo what First Amendment issues did the DMCA present? Most\r\nobviously, the DMCA gave a new right to copyright owners. By\r\nusing a few simple technological measures, they could distribute\r\na work in a particular format and yet, because of their new\r\nintellectual property right, they could make illegal an\r\notherwise lawful process of gaining access for the purposes of\r\nmaking fair use. Of course, the First Amendment allows me to\r\nmake fair use factually impossible. I can do that without\r\nraising any constitutional issues by hiding my manuscript and\r\nnever letting you see it or just by using unbreakable encryption\r\non my digital products. It allows me to use existing\r\nconventional property rights to make fair use illegal. If I own\r\nthe only copy of the book and it is inside my house, it would be\r\ntrespass for you to enter. No First Amendment problem there. But\r\nin passing the DMCA, Congress had created a new intellectual\r\nproperty right inside copyright law itself, a law aimed directly\r\nat expression, that made it illegal to get access for the\r\npurpose of making fair use even when you legally bought the\r\nphysical book, or the physical DVD, and now wish to quote it or\r\nparody it. Even that is not the problem. It is that Congress\r\ncannot grant the exclusive rights of copyright without\r\nsimultaneously accompanying them by the limitations of fair\r\nuse.8 Regardless of what physical constraints and tangible\r\nproperty rights might do to limit my ability to make fair uses,\r\nCongress had now, by law, allowed a copyright owner to\r\ndistribute a particular work with the exclusive rights but\r\nwithout some of those limitations.\r\n48\r\n\r\nImagine that Congress had passed the following law instead of\r\nthe DMCA: \"Any copyright owner can make it illegal to make a\r\nfair use of a copyrighted work by putting a red dot on their\r\nbooks, records, and films before selling them. It shall be a\r\ncrime to circumvent the red dot even if, but for the dot, the\r\nuse would have been fair.\" That would be clearly\r\nunconstitutional. It gives copyright owners a new intellectual\r\nproperty right to \"turn off fair use\" in copyrighted works\r\ndistributed to the mass market. Is the DMCA not the same thing?\r\n49\r\n\r\nThis was the issue in Reimerdes. True, if I cut through the\r\ndigital fence on a DVD in order to excerpt a small portion in a\r\ncritical documentary, I would not be violating your copyright,\r\nbut I would be violating the anticircumvention provisions. And\r\nDeCSS seemed to be a tool for doing what the DMCA forbids. By\r\nproviding links to it, Mr. Corley and 2600 were \"trafficking\" in\r\na technology that allows others to circumvent a technological\r\nprotection measure. DeCSS could, of course, be used for purposes\r\nthat did not violate copyright--to make the DVD play on a\r\ncomputer running Linux, for example. It enabled various\r\nnoninfringing fair uses. It could also be used to aid illicit\r\ncopying. But the alleged violation of the DMCA had nothing to do\r\nwith that. The alleged violation of the DMCA was making the\r\ndigital wire cutters available in the first place. So one First\r\nAmendment problem with the DMCA can be stated quite simply. It\r\nappeared to make it illegal to exercise at least some of the\r\nlimitations and exceptions copyright law needs in order to pass\r\nFirst Amendment scrutiny. Or did it just make it very, very\r\ndifficult to exercise those rights legally? I could, after all,\r\nmake a videotape of the DVD playing on my television, and use\r\nthat grainy, blurry image in my documentary criticizing the\r\nfilmmaker. The DMCA would not be violated, though my movie might\r\nbe painful to watch.\r\n50\r\n\r\nThe other possible First Amendment problem with the DMCA was\r\nthat in regulating programs such as DeCSS, the DMCA was actually\r\nregulating \"speech.\" The first challenge to the DMCA was that,\r\nby making tools like DeCSS illegal, the DMCA took away a\r\nconstitutionally necessary escape hatch to copyright, thus\r\nmaking copyright law as a whole violate the First Amendment's\r\nguarantee of freedom of speech. The second challenge was\r\ndifferent. The problem was that the program itself was speech\r\nand the DMCA was regulating it illicitly.\r\n51\r\n\r\nThe reasoning went like this. A computer program is a form of\r\nexpression and communication. The source code can even be read\r\nby human beings. True, it is an abstract form of\r\ncommunication--like musical notation and mathematical algorithms.\r\nBut those are clearly protected by the First Amendment. Congress\r\ncould not make Schoenberg's twelve-tone scale illegal or punish\r\nmathematicians for physics equations that seemed to support a\r\ntheory of the universe's origin other than the creationism that\r\nis currently so popular. True, the source code is a description\r\nof a method of doing something, and the code can, if run on a\r\ncomputer, produce a result--but one could argue that those\r\nattributes do not affect the First Amendment's protection.\r\nNeither a recipe for hash brownies nor a player piano roll for\r\nthe Nazi \"Horst Wessel\" song could constitutionally be\r\nprohibited, even though actually to make the hash brownies would\r\nbe illegal, and even though the piano roll is functional (it\r\n\"makes\" the player piano play the tune). True, most people\r\ncannot read computer code, but speech does not need to be common\r\nor accessible to be protected. In fact, the courts have even\r\nheld that the choice to communicate in a particular language is\r\nconstitutionally protected in some settings.\r\n52\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, software code is undeniably functional. Lots\r\nof functional articles can be said to have some expressive\r\ncontent--a gun, an airbag, a crash helmet, a set of burglar's\r\ntools, a computer virus. And many actions have expressive\r\ncontent: a terrorist bombing, for example. Surely these could be\r\nregulated by Congress? To the defendants, DeCSS looked like a\r\nphysics equation, a musical score, or a recipe. To the movie\r\nstudios, DeCSS had all the First Amendment significance of a\r\ncrowbar, lock pick, or, for that matter, a car bombing. The same\r\nargument was repeated over the hyperlinks that Corley and others\r\nprovided to sites which carried the DeCSS program. Speech or\r\nfunction? To the defendants, forbidding 2600 to link to these\r\nsites was like preventing the Washington Post from describing\r\nthe availability of drugs on certain blocks of 16th Street. To\r\nthe movie companies, the hyperlinks were the equivalent of\r\nloading potential buyers into a van, taking them down there, and\r\ngiving them enough money to make the purchase.\r\n53\r\n\r\nWhich of the two First Amendment arguments is more convincing?\r\nThat the DMCA is a congressionally created off-switch for fair\r\nuse? Or that software code is speech and the DMCA restricts it?\r\nLike a lot of scholars, before Reimerdes went to trial, I\r\nthought that the first argument was by far the more powerful. I\r\nstill do. I thought the odds of the court buying the \"code is\r\nspeech\" argument were low. About that I was wrong, though it\r\nturned out not to matter.\r\n54\r\n\r\nA number of the reports noted that after some initial\r\nskepticism, Judge Kaplan had been impressed by the defendants'\r\nexpert witnesses, particularly those who had testified that code\r\nwas speech. When the ruling came out, this impression was\r\nconfirmed. Judge Kaplan agreed that code was a form of speech or\r\nexpression. But celebration was premature. Having done so, he\r\ndisagreed with the defendants' claim that it could not be\r\nregulated.\r\n55\r\n\r\n    Computer code is expressive. To that extent, it is a matter\r\nof First Amendment concern. But computer code is not purely\r\nexpressive any more than the assassination of a political figure\r\nis purely a political statement. Code causes computers to\r\nperform desired functions. Its expressive element no more\r\nimmunizes its functional aspects from regulation than the\r\nexpressive motives of an assassin immunize the assassin's\r\naction. In an era in which the transmission of computer viruses--\r\nwhich, like DeCSS, are simply computer code and thus to some\r\ndegree expressive-- can disable systems upon which the nation\r\ndepends and in which other computer code also is capable of\r\ninflicting other harm, society must be able to regulate the use\r\nand dissemination of code in appropriate circumstances. The\r\nConstitution, after all, is a framework for building a just and\r\ndemocratic society. It is not a suicide pact.9\r\n56\r\n\r\nJudge Kaplan is right in saying that there cannot be a bright-\r\nline rule immunizing computer code from regulation merely\r\nbecause it has expressive elements. The First Amendment does not\r\nprotect computer viruses. But the defendants were not arguing\r\nthat computer code was constitutionally inviolable, only that\r\nany law that regulated it had to be subject to First Amendment\r\nscrutiny. After all, the government makes the description of how\r\nto make a nuclear weapon classified information. That is clearly\r\n\"speech,\" but its regulation is also constitutional. The First\r\nAmendment is not, and never was, an absolute guarantee of\r\nfreedom of speech. Instead, the question is whether the law is\r\nwithin the realm of \"the freedom of speech\" guarantee, which in\r\nturn depends on what kind of a law it is. Where does it fit in\r\nthe \"levels of scrutiny\" that courts have constructed to\r\ndiscriminate between types of legislation affecting speech? Is\r\nthe DMCA a \"content-based\" regulation, such as a law forbidding\r\nlabor picketing but allowing other kinds of demonstrations?\r\nContent-based regulations are given the highest and most\r\ndemanding level of scrutiny. Alternatively, is it a \"content-\r\nneutral\" regulation, such as a law that forbids talking--about\r\nany subject--in a library? To Judge Kaplan, the answer was clear,\r\nand grounds for sarcasm.\r\n57\r\n\r\n    The reason that Congress enacted the anti-trafficking\r\nprovision of the DMCA had nothing to do with suppressing\r\nparticular ideas of computer programmers and everything to do\r\nwith functionality--with preventing people from circumventing\r\ntechnological access control measures--just as laws prohibiting\r\nthe possession of burglar tools have nothing to do with\r\npreventing people from expressing themselves by accumulating\r\nwhat to them may be attractive assortments of implements and\r\neverything to do with preventing burglaries.\r\n58\r\n\r\nI agree, though it is worth noting that the burglar tool analogy\r\nis a disputed one. Johansen claimed DeCSS was more like a\r\nscrewdriver--something with both licit and illicit uses.\r\n59\r\n\r\nSo the DMCA was content-neutral regulation. That means it still\r\nhas to pass a fairly daunting legal threshold. It will only be\r\nupheld if \"it furthers an important or substantial governmental\r\ninterest; if the governmental interest is unrelated to the\r\nsuppression of free expression; and if the incidental\r\nrestriction on alleged First Amendment freedoms is no greater\r\nthan is essential to the furtherance of that interest.\"10 Judge\r\nKaplan felt that the DMCA satisfied that standard. I am not so\r\nsure. Yes, the governmental interest in protecting copyright\r\nholders' rights is important. And yes, I must disagree with some\r\nof my friends in the civil liberties world and say that the\r\ngovernment's interest is unrelated to the suppression of free\r\nexpression. But is \"the incidental restriction of First\r\nAmendment freedoms no greater than is essential to the\r\nfurtherance of that interest\"? In other words, could the DMCA\r\nhave achieved its goals without imposing as great a limitation\r\non the expression of people like Mr. Johansen and Mr. Corley?\r\n60\r\n\r\nCongress could have passed many laws less restrictive than the\r\nDMCA. It could have only penalized the use of programs such as\r\nDeCSS for an illicit purpose. If it wished to reach those who\r\ncreate the tools as well as use them, it could have required\r\nproof that the creator intended them to be used for illegal\r\npurposes. Just as we look at the government's intention in\r\ncreating the law, we could make the intent of the software\r\nwriter critical for the purposes of assessing whether or not his\r\nactions are illegal. If I write a novel detailing a clever way\r\nto kill someone and you use it to carry out a real murder, the\r\nFirst Amendment does not allow the state to punish me. If I\r\nwrite a manual on how to be a hit man and sell it to you, it\r\nmay. First Amendment law is generally skeptical of statutes that\r\nimpose \"strict liability\" without a requirement of intent. But\r\nJudge Kaplan believed that the DMCA made the motives of Mr.\r\nJohansen irrelevant, except insofar as they were relevant to the\r\nnarrowly tailored exceptions of the DMCA, such as encryption\r\nresearch. In other words, even if Mr. Johansen made DeCSS so\r\nthat he and his friends could watch DVDs they purchased legally\r\non computers running Linux, they could still be liable for\r\nbreaking the DMCA.\r\n61\r\n\r\nThe DMCA's breadth goes further than its treatment of intent.\r\nThe statute could have only made it illegal to provide a program\r\nyourself. But Judge Kaplan interpreted it to prohibit even\r\nlinking to a site where the program is to be found. No\r\nrequirement of intent. No requirement that you actually supply\r\nthe infringing program. That is a pretty broad interpretation\r\nand one which he admits restricts expression. How could he\r\nconclude that restrictions this broad were \"no greater than\r\nessential\"? From his rhetoric, the answer is clear. Judge Kaplan\r\nbelieves the story of the Internet Threat I discussed in Chapter\r\n4. He sees DeCSS as a poison. In fact, he thinks it is worse\r\nthan a poison because it may spread to infect others. It is a\r\ndisease, a virus. The DMCA is the stern and harsh quarantine\r\nrequired to control it--a digital public health measure. His\r\nreasoning is worth quoting at length.\r\n62\r\n\r\n    There was a time when copyright infringement could be dealt\r\nwith quite adequately by focusing on the infringing act. . . .\r\nThe copyright holder . . . usually was able to trace the copies\r\nup the chain of distribution, find and prosecute the infringer,\r\nand shut off the infringement at the source. In principle, the\r\ndigital world is very different. Once a decryption program like\r\nDeCSS is written, it quickly can be sent all over the world.\r\nEvery recipient is capable not only of decrypting and perfectly\r\ncopying plaintiffs' copyrighted DVDs, but also of retransmitting\r\nperfect copies of DeCSS and thus enabling every recipient to do\r\nthe same. . . . The process potentially is exponential rather\r\nthan linear. Indeed, the difference is illustrated by comparison\r\nof two epidemiological models describing the spread of different\r\nkinds of disease. In a common source epidemic, as where members\r\nof a population contract a non-contagious disease from a\r\npoisoned well, the disease spreads only by exposure to the\r\ncommon source. If one eliminates the source, or closes the\r\ncontaminated well, the epidemic is stopped. In a propagated\r\noutbreak epidemic, on the other hand, the disease spreads from\r\nperson to person. Hence, finding the initial source of infection\r\naccomplishes little, as the disease continues to spread even if\r\nthe initial source is eliminated.11\r\n63\r\n\r\nThis is a very good point, and one that the critics of the DMCA\r\nsometimes gloss over too quickly. The structure of digital\r\nreplication is indeed different from the old centralized model\r\nof copying and distribution. Instead of tracing all illicit\r\ncopies back to a single infringing printing press, we face the\r\nfear that the machinery of piracy can be copied just as fast as\r\nthe copies it allows us to make.\r\n64\r\n\r\nIt is here that the defendants lose the battle of the metaphors.\r\nYes, code is speech, it conveys information. But viruses are\r\ncodes and they convey information too. Judge Kaplan explicitly\r\ninvokes this comparison several times. Biological viruses are\r\ntools for the replication of genetic information. They subvert\r\ntheir hosts' cellular programming to make copies of themselves,\r\njust as a computer virus hijacks an infected computer and causes\r\nit to send out more copies of the virus. True, DeCSS requires\r\nhuman intervention to download the program and use it. Yet from\r\nJudge Kaplan's language it is evident that he sees the program\r\nnot as an act of expression but as a virus spreading like\r\nwildfire. Seen this way, the individual \"choices\" to download or\r\nredistribute are simply the program's method of spreading\r\nitself, like the irritation produced by the cold virus that\r\nencourages sneezes and coughs, thereby transmitting the illness\r\nto others. Just as in an epidemic, the harshest measures are\r\ncalled for. There is no poisoned well here, no pirate with a\r\nprinting press we can shut down. Anyone is potentially an\r\ninfringer. Individuals cannot be presumed to be healthy. We\r\ncannot give their immune systems, or their motives, the benefit\r\nof the doubt. Instead we must see them as potential carriers.\r\nThe healthy must be quarantined as well as the sick. Facing such\r\na danger, Judge Kaplan agrees that Congress needed to be\r\ndraconian. We cannot wait for illegal copying. We must strike\r\npreemptively at the technology that might enable it. There is no\r\nplace for inquiries into \"intent\" here; no way that we can\r\nrestrict liability to those who actually provide the program.\r\nThus, though \"code is speech\" and the DMCA does incidentally\r\nrestrict expression, Judge Kaplan concludes that its restraints\r\nare no greater than is necessary.\r\n65\r\n\r\nThere are three questions here. The first is whether Congress\r\nwas right. The second is whether, in the context of the movie\r\nindustry, we can see evidence of the evil it needed to combat.\r\nThe third question is very different: whether the DMCA is\r\nconstitutional. In my opinion, the answer to questions one and\r\ntwo is no, for the reasons outlined in Chapter 4's analysis of\r\nthe Internet Threat. Yes, cheaper copying can increase the rate\r\nof illicit copying, but it also lowers advertising costs and\r\noffers new business models--Netflix, downloads on demand, viral\r\ndistribution of trailers, and so on. The technology helps as\r\nwell as hurts. It does not help the movie industry as much as it\r\nmight help the music industry, which can more easily distribute\r\nits products over the Internet. But the Internet also does not\r\npose as much danger to movies as it does to music. The movie\r\nindustry's doomsaying aside, there is no exact movie equivalent\r\nof Napster and there is unlikely to be one in the near future.12\r\n66\r\n\r\nThis is not just because movies are longer and harder to\r\ndownload than songs. It is because most people only watch a film\r\nonce. Most people do not want a library of two thousand films to\r\nplay again and again. Music is a repeated experience good in a\r\nway that movies simply are not, and that social fact profoundly\r\naffects the likelihood of downloading as opposed to rental. The\r\ntransient song on a radio or an Internet stream is not an\r\nadequate substitute for possessing the song\r\npermanently--something which costs a lot more. Apart from kids'\r\nmovies, which can be used to induce catatonia in one's progeny\r\ntime and again, and a few classic favorites, most people do not\r\nwant to own movies. Watching the film on television or renting\r\nit for a night is perfectly satisfactory. Both of these involve\r\nlittle hassle or cost. The content industries are fond of saying\r\n\"you cannot compete with free.\" But this is simply not true.\r\nCheap and easily acquired goods of certified quality compete\r\nvery well with free goods of uncertain quality whose acquisition\r\ninvolves some difficulty. This is one of the main reasons the\r\nmovie companies were wrong in the Sony case.\r\n67\r\n\r\nThus while Judge Kaplan's discussion of the looming digital\r\nBlack Death is nicely apocalyptic, it does not seem very\r\naccurate. How many of your friends download movies illicitly\r\nover the Internet, let alone movies that were ripped from DVDs?\r\nYes, it can be done. But the actual descriptions of the process\r\nin the Reimerdes case smack more of bathos than terror.\r\n68\r\n\r\n    Although the process is computationally intensive,\r\nplaintiffs' expert decrypted a store-bought copy of Sleepless in\r\nSeattle in 20 to 45 minutes. . . . The decryption of a CSS-\r\nprotected DVD is only the beginning of the tale, as the\r\ndecrypted file is very large. . . . One solution to this\r\nproblem, however, is DivX, a compression utility available on\r\nthe Internet that is promoted as a means of compressing\r\ndecrypted motion picture files to manageable size. . . . While\r\nthe compressed sound and graphic files then must be\r\nsynchronized, a tedious process that took plaintiffs' expert\r\nbetween 10 and 20 hours, the task is entirely feasible. . . . At\r\ntrial, defendants repeated, as if it were a mantra, the refrain\r\nthat plaintiffs, as they stipulated, have no direct evidence of\r\na specific occasion on which any person decrypted a copyrighted\r\nmotion picture with DeCSS and transmitted it over the Internet.\r\nBut that is unpersuasive. Plaintiffs' expert expended very\r\nlittle effort to find someone in an IRC chat room who exchanged\r\na compressed, decrypted copy of The Matrix, one of plaintiffs'\r\ncopyrighted motion pictures, for a copy of Sleepless in Seattle.\r\nWhile the simultaneous electronic exchange of the two movies\r\ntook approximately six hours, the computers required little\r\noperator attention during the interim.\r\n69\r\n\r\nSo the epidemic threat that hangs over the movie industry\r\nconsists of the danger that someone will spend fifteen minutes\r\ndecrypting and ten to twenty hours tediously synchronizing a\r\nmovie that is then available for a speedy six-hour download?\r\n70\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, someone only needs to do the synchronizing once.\r\nThere are newer tools that make the task easier. And we could\r\nimprove the download time. But even so, would you bother? Faced\r\nwith the colossal expense and hassle of renting the same movie\r\nat Blockbuster for $3, some consumers might prefer this process,\r\nI suppose. But I would not sell my shares in movie studios quite\r\nyet. In fact, the real threat to movie studios is the large-\r\nscale criminal distribution of illicitly copied DVDs--copied bit\r\nfor bit from the original. The distributors of those do not need\r\nto use programs like DeCSS. A more distant threat comes from\r\nlegal recordings from television made on TiVo's and\r\nReplayTVs--where consumers' actions are legal and CSS is not an\r\nissue. So far as we can tell, there is no measurable effect of\r\nillicit digital downloads on sales or rentals of DVDs. We could\r\ngo through the process Judge Kaplan describes, I suppose, just\r\nas when the VCR was invented we could have taped movies from\r\ntelevision and swapped them with our friends. But as the movie\r\nstudios discovered after the Sony case, most of us would rather\r\njust rent the movie. Because something is possible does not mean\r\nit will happen.\r\n71\r\n\r\nSo in my view, Congress generally overestimated the threat posed\r\nby the digital world and underestimated the benefits. In\r\naddition, the movie industry is a weak place to make the case\r\nfor the necessity of the DMCA. Fine, but that is not the legal\r\nissue here. The constitutionality of the DMCA does not turn on\r\nwhether the DMCA was a good idea. That is not the court's\r\ndecision to make. The question is not even whether the\r\nparticular industry involved is, in reality, facing much of a\r\nthreat from digital downloading. The law, after all, exists for\r\nall digital works, not just the ones at issue here. The question\r\nis whether the restriction on speech imposed by the DMCA was \"no\r\ngreater than is essential.\" And that is a harder question.\r\n72\r\n\r\nI still disagree with Judge Kaplan. A more narrowly tailored\r\nstatute could have accomplished the DMCA's legitimate goals\r\nwithout impinging as greatly on expression. I think that the\r\nrhetoric of the Internet Threat blinded Judge Kaplan to some\r\nimportant issues and led him to overestimate the danger and thus\r\nthe severity of the measures necessary to combat it. Thus, even\r\nunder the \"code is speech\" part of the analysis, I think the\r\nDMCA fails First Amendment scrutiny. But if we are confining\r\nourselves to the expression inherent in the software itself, I\r\nacknowledge that it is a close call.\r\n73\r\n\r\nSadly, Judge Kaplan spent much less time on the other First\r\nAmendment argument against the DMCA--that it is unconstitutional\r\nbecause it gives copyright holders a new intellectual property\r\nentitlement, created by Congress under the Copyright Clause, a\r\nlegal power to deprive users of a constitutionally required\r\nlimitation on copyright's exclusive rights. In my view, he also\r\nframed the argument wrongly when he did discuss it. To be fair,\r\nthese problems can partly be traced to the fact that the\r\ndefendants spent most of their energy on the argument that code\r\nwas expression, paying less attention to everything else. As\r\nJudge Kaplan explained it, the claim was that the DMCA might\r\nhave the effect of restricting an alleged fair use right of\r\naccess to copyrighted material. Predictably enough, he responded\r\nthat there was no such right of access. Copyright holders could\r\nalways lock up the book or restrict entrance to the gallery. In\r\nany event, while fair use of DVDs might be curtailed, he argued\r\nthat most movies are also available on videotape. Even if the\r\nfilm were only available on DVD, the prospective fair user could\r\nwrite down the words and quote them, or record the sound from\r\nthe screen. Finally, Judge Kaplan pointed out that even if the\r\nDMCA might allow a significant erosion of fair use to develop\r\nover time, such a problem was not present here. Those making\r\nFirst Amendment claims are sometimes allowed by courts to show\r\nthat, even if the law as it applied to them were constitutional,\r\nit would restrict the First Amendment rights of others. Judge\r\nKaplan declined to apply that doctrine here. In effect, he said\r\n\"come back when there is a problem.\"\r\n74\r\n\r\nOn appeal, the case was decided by a panel led by Judge Jon\r\nNewman. Here the fair use argument received more attention but\r\nthe result was the same: \"Come back when there is a problem.\"\r\nSignificantly, both courts pointed out another concern. The DMCA\r\ncould effectively make copyright perpetual because even though\r\nthe copyright term would expire, the legally protected\r\nencryption would continue, and tools such as DeCSS, which would\r\nhave allowed access to the public domain work, would be\r\nillegal.13 This is a major issue because it appears to violate\r\nboth the First Amendment and the Copyright Clause's requirement\r\nof a limited time. The defendants did not spend adequate time on\r\nthis argument, however, and the courts again left it for later\r\nconsideration.\r\n75\r\n\r\nThe court of appeals saw the defendants' argument in just the\r\nsame way as Judge Kaplan had seen it: a claim that there was a\r\nfair use right of actual access to the finest version of every\r\nwork in every medium, on which the DMCA put a practical\r\nlimitation. Such a claim was easy to dismiss. There was no such\r\nright of guaranteed practical access. Copyright owners could\r\nrestrict the practical ability to exercise fair use in many ways\r\nwithout the Constitution being involved. In addition, in a world\r\nwhere copyrighted content is frequently available in both analog\r\nand digital form, the actual effects of the DMCA might be\r\ntrivial and were, in any event, constitutionally acceptable.\r\nJudge Newman repeated Judge Kaplan's point that one could always\r\nmake fair use of the work in a way the DMCA did not reach, such\r\nas by videotaping a picture of the screen.\r\n76\r\n\r\n    The fact that the resulting copy will not be as perfect or\r\nas manipulable as a digital copy obtained by having direct\r\naccess to the DVD movie in its digital form, provides no basis\r\nfor a claim of unconstitutional limitation of fair use. A film\r\ncritic making fair use of a movie by quoting selected lines of\r\ndialogue has no constitutionally valid claim that the review (in\r\nprint or on television) would be technologically superior if the\r\nreviewer had not been prevented from using a movie camera in the\r\ntheater, nor has an art student a valid constitutional claim to\r\nfair use of a painting by photographing it in a museum. Fair use\r\nhas never been held to be a guarantee of access to copyrighted\r\nmaterial in order to copy it by the fair user's preferred\r\ntechnique or in the format of the original.\r\n77\r\n\r\nOnce the issue is framed this way, the case has been lost. I\r\nwould argue that there are three baseline errors here: a focus\r\non \"affirmative rights of access\" as opposed to limits on\r\nCongress's power in handing out exclusive rights over expression\r\nwithout their constitutionally necessary limitations, a focus on\r\npractical effects of the provisions rather than on formal\r\nconstitutional limitations on the copyright system over all\r\nclasses of works, and a confusion between intellectual property\r\nrights and physical property rights that goes to the heart of\r\nthe Jefferson Warning discussed in Chapter 2. The question is\r\nnot whether users have a constitutionally protected right of\r\npractical access to a preferred version of a work. The question\r\nis whether it violates the First Amendment for Congress to give\r\nto copyright holders an intellectual property right to exempt\r\ntheir copyrighted works in some formats from fair use and other\r\nprovisions that are necessary for copyright law in general to be\r\nconstitutional.\r\n78\r\n\r\nRemember my earlier example. What if Congress amended Section\r\n1201 to say \"Any copyright owner can make it illegal to make a\r\nfair use of a copyrighted work by putting a red dot on their\r\nbooks, records, and films before selling them. It shall be a\r\ncrime to circumvent the red dot even if, but for the dot, the\r\nuse would have been fair\"? This statute, I think, is clearly\r\nunconstitutional. It would be no answer to say that some owners\r\nwill not use the red dot, and even for those that do, there will\r\nbe older, dotless versions still available. It is irrelevant\r\nthat I might be able to copy down the crucial lines of the book\r\nover your shoulder while you read it and thus claim that I,\r\npersonally, had not circumvented the dot. The\r\nunconstitutionality of the statute does not turn on whether the\r\ndots might fall off because of bad adhesive, or whether there\r\nare many secondhand bookstores in the area, in which undotted\r\nvolumes can be found. Even if the red dot rule were only to be\r\napplied to hardback books, or graphic novels, or cassette tapes,\r\nit would still be unconstitutional. Nor do we have to wait until\r\nthe entire marketplace is dominated by red-dotted products\r\nbefore considering the issue. It is no answer to say that even\r\nbefore the red dot rule, copyright holders could always have\r\nhidden their works, or locked them in safes, or even negotiated\r\nindividual contracts with the purchasers that have the effect of\r\nlimiting fair use. That way of framing it just misunderstands\r\nthe issue on a fundamental level. The claim is not about the\r\nhappenstance of practical access or the way that a copyright\r\nholder can use physical control of an object or existing\r\ntangible property rights to undercut fair use.\r\n79\r\n\r\nThe point is that Congress violates the First Amendment when,\r\nwith respect to any work, it gives me an intellectual property\r\nright to prohibit copying and distribution of an expressive work\r\nsold in the marketplace and an additional legal power to opt out\r\nof the limitations contained in Section 107 over that work. The\r\nbundle of rights conveyed by the DMCA does exactly that. It is\r\nnot the DMCA alone that we must analyze. The question is whether\r\nCongress can give the exclusive rights contained in Section 106\r\nof the Copyright Act over a particular class of works (say\r\ndigital works), if it also gives a new right to prohibit\r\ncitizens from gaining access to those works for the purposes of\r\nmaking a fair use. If Judge Kaplan and Judge Newman are correct,\r\nthen the DMCA gives an entirely new intellectual property right\r\n(technically, a legal power) to the copyright holders to do\r\nexactly that. To put it the other way around, the DMCA subtracts\r\nfrom the citizen's bundle of entitlements under federal\r\ncopyright law, the right (technically, lawyers would call it a\r\nprivilege) to gain access to a work legally in his possession\r\nfor the purpose of making a fair use. It is that rule change\r\nthat is unconstitutional, I would argue, and the way Judge\r\nKaplan and Judge Newman frame that issue makes them miss the\r\npoint.\r\n80\r\n\r\nFraming is important. The confusions that I have talked about in\r\nthis book all make an appearance. It starts with the whole\r\ncontroversy being framed by the Internet Threat story line from\r\nChapter 4. Because Judge Kaplan is convinced that every citizen\r\nis now a potential infringer, a potentially infectious virus\r\ncarrier, he is ill disposed to listen to claims about fair use.\r\nCivil liberties claims do not do very well in epidemics. It is\r\nonly right for him to defer to Congress's perception of the\r\nproblem and the solution, of course. But he buys so deeply into\r\nthe magnitude of the threat, the extent of the potential piracy\r\npandemic, that it is very hard for him to take seriously the\r\nidea that even here there is a legitimate constitutional fair\r\nuse claim.\r\n81\r\n\r\nThe Sony Axiom from Chapter 4 is also ignored, or at least\r\nundervalued. As I pointed out there, without a robust set of\r\nexceptions and limitations on copyright, the idea that cheaper\r\ncopying requires greater control will inexorably drive us toward\r\nthe position that the technologies of cheaper reproduction must\r\nbe put under the governance of copyright holders. The DMCA\r\ncontinues that logic; its drafters concluded that the right to\r\nget access to digital works for purposes of making a fair use\r\nmust be taken from the bundle of rights possessed by citizens,\r\nwhile the right to enjoin both access and the technologies of\r\naccess is added to those of copyright holders. Never mind the\r\ncorrectness of such a conclusion as a matter of policy. Are\r\nthere constitutional limitations on Congress taking such an\r\naction? Kaplan and Newman in effect tell us, \"not yet.\"\r\n82\r\n\r\nMore important than the perception of the threat is the\r\nunderstanding of what intellectual property is all about. In\r\nChapter 2, Jefferson warned us that intellectual property rights\r\nare not like physical property rights. In analyzing the DMCA,\r\nwhere do we turn for analogies? To physical property, violence,\r\nand theft. The cases analyzing the DMCA are full of analogies to\r\ntrespass, to breaking and entering, to burglars' tools, and to\r\nsafecrackers. Private property carries a lot of baggage with it,\r\nbut we know it well--it is the place we naturally turn for\r\ninsight. Even I, in order to point out some of the difficulties\r\nwith those analogies, had to turn to farmers and barbed wire and\r\npublic rights-of-way along highways. There is nothing wrong with\r\nanalogies. They help us understand things that are new by\r\ncomparing them to things we think we understand better.\r\nAnalogies are only bad when they ignore the key difference\r\nbetween the two things being analyzed. That is what happens\r\nhere.\r\n83\r\n\r\nJefferson reminded us that intellectual property rights are\r\nclearly artifacts of state creation, monopolies whose internal\r\nlimitations in scope, duration, and so on are just as important\r\nas the rights themselves. Jefferson doubts whether even property\r\nrights over land can be understood as natural and\r\nabsolute--copyrights and patents, which cover subject matter that\r\ncan be infinitely reproduced without diminishing its substance,\r\nclearly cannot. They frequently involve a claim to control\r\npurchasers' behavior with respect to some aspect of an artifact\r\nafter it has been sold to them in the marketplace, making\r\nsimpleminded analogies to \"breaking and entering\"\r\ninappropriate--the extent of the property in question is\r\nprecisely the issue in dispute. (When Johansen was tried in\r\nNorway under the national computer crime law, the court\r\nlaconically observed that he had bought the DVDs, and one cannot\r\nbreak into one's own property--effectively turning the analogy on\r\nits head.) Jefferson starts from the baseline that monopoly is\r\nthe exception and freedom is the rule--any limitations on that\r\nfreedom have to be justified. That is why he always discusses\r\nthe right and the limitations on the right as an inseparable\r\npair. One cannot discuss them in isolation.\r\n84\r\n\r\nKaplan and Newman are fine, thoughtful judges. They do not\r\naltogether ignore those points. But look how the analysis is set\r\nup. At several points in the discussion, there seems to be the\r\nassumption that copyright owners have entitlements to total\r\ncontrol as of right and that fair use is a mere lucky loophole\r\nwhich, because it can be negated by the happenstance of whether\r\none can get physical access, can hardly have major First\r\nAmendment status. They keep pointing out that physical control\r\nand tangible property rights frequently allow copyright holders\r\nto make fair use impracticable. \"And so what?\" Jefferson might\r\nhave responded. This is a classic non sequitur. The question is\r\nwhether the Congress has the power to add a new right of access-\r\ndenial to the intellectual property monopoly it is constructing,\r\nundermining--as to some works and some fair uses--the balance that\r\nthe law sets up. The citizen is not pleading for a new right of\r\naccess, trumping all physical restraint and tangible property\r\nrights. The citizen is claiming that Congress has no power to\r\ngive exclusive rights to restrain copying of digital content\r\nwhile simultaneously taking away the citizen's existing right to\r\nget access to that content for the purposes of fair use--at least\r\nin those cases where access is physically possible and violates\r\nno other property right, real or intellectual.\r\n85\r\n\r\nThe Constitution does not require the United States to break\r\ninto President Nixon's desk to get me his tapes, buy me a tape\r\nrecorder, or give me a right to 18.5 minutes on the broadcast\r\nairwaves to play them. But if I can get access to the tapes\r\nlegally, it does forbid the government from giving President\r\nNixon the power to put a red dot on those tapes and thus claim\r\nan intellectual property right to stop me playing them on TV or\r\ndigitizing them to make the sounds clearer. The restraints\r\nimposed by physical happenstance and tangible property rights\r\nare different from those imposed by copyright--a congressionally\r\ncreated monopoly over expression. We cannot assume because one\r\nis constitutionally acceptable that the others are too.\r\nJefferson understood that, and his analysis can help us even in\r\na constitutional conflict over a technology he could hardly have\r\ndreamt of. (Though perhaps with Jefferson, this is a bad bet.)\r\n86\r\n\r\nThe same point comes up in a different way when the court\r\ndisconnects the fair use discussion from the exclusive rights\r\ndiscussion. The question is not \"Do I have a constitutionally\r\nprotected right of physical access to a preferred version of a\r\nmovie, so as to make my task easy?\" That gets the court caught\r\nup in questions of when a majority of movies will only be\r\navailable on DVD, or how poor a substitute the analog version\r\nwould be, or how many fair uses will require actually cutting a\r\ndigital fence. But all of these inquiries miss the point. The\r\nquestion is \"Can Congress hand out the exclusive rights of\r\ncopyright over digital works if it does not accompany those\r\nrights with the suite of limitations that the court has\r\nrepeatedly said \"saves\" copyright from violating the First\r\nAmendment?\" The proportion of digital works to the total number\r\nof works produced in other formats is irrelevant. As to these\r\nworks, the rule is unconstitutional. But what about the number\r\nor proportion of types of fair uses affected? That is more\r\nrelevant but still not dispositive in the way Kaplan and Newman\r\nimagined. True, not every trivial statutory modification of fair\r\nuse makes copyright unconstitutional. But this is not a trivial\r\nmodification: over an entire class of works, copyright owners\r\nare given a legal power to deprive users of their privilege to\r\ngain otherwise lawful access for the purposes of fair use. If\r\nyou give the digital filmmaker the exclusive rights of copyright\r\nbut forbid the film professor from going through the otherwise\r\nlawful process of parodying or quoting, that rule is\r\nunconstitutional, no matter how many other fair uses are\r\nunaffected. If the copyright law were amended to forbid\r\njournalists playing, on a Friday, excerpts of legally acquired\r\nred-dotted tapes made by presidents whose last name begins with\r\nN, it would still be unconstitutional.\r\n87\r\n\r\nThe legal implementation of this conclusion would be simple. It\r\nwould be unconstitutional to punish an individual for gaining\r\naccess in order to make a fair use. However, if they cut down\r\nthe digital fence to make illicit copies, both the cutting and\r\nthe copying would be illegal. But what about the prohibition of\r\ntrafficking in digital wire cutters, technologies such as DeCSS?\r\nThere the constitutional question is harder. I would argue that\r\nthe First Amendment requires an interpretation of the\r\nantitrafficking provisions that comes closer to the ruling in\r\nthe Sony case. If Mr. Johansen did indeed make DeCSS to play\r\nDVDs on his Linux computer, and if that were indeed a\r\nsubstantial noninfringing use, then it cannot be illegal for him\r\nto develop the technology. But I accept that this is a harder\r\nline to draw constitutionally. About my first conclusion,\r\nthough, I think the argument is both strong and clear.\r\n88\r\n\r\nIronically, there is some support for my claim and it comes from\r\nan even higher, if not uniformly more thoughtful, set of judges\r\nthan Newman and Kaplan. In the depressing case of Eldred v.\r\nAshcroft, the Supreme Court upheld retrospective copyright term\r\nextensions against a variety of constitutional challenges. (Full\r\ndisclosure: I assisted in the preparation of an amicus curiae\r\nbrief in the case.) One of those challenges was based on the\r\nFirst Amendment. The fairly reasonable claim was that Congress\r\ncould not retroactively lock up an entire twenty-year swathe of\r\nculture that had already been produced. Such a law would be all\r\nrestraint of expression, performance, republication, adaption,\r\nand so on, with no incentive benefits. The Court was\r\nunconvinced. But it did say:\r\n89\r\n\r\n    To the extent such assertions raise First Amendment\r\nconcerns, copyright's built-in free speech safeguards are\r\ngenerally adequate to address them. We recognize that the D.C.\r\nCircuit spoke too broadly when it declared copyrights\r\n\"categorically immune from challenges under the First\r\nAmendment.\" . . . But when, as in this case, Congress has not\r\naltered the traditional contours of copyright protection,\r\nfurther First Amendment scrutiny is unnecessary.14\r\n90\r\n\r\nThe DMCA, of course, does exactly this. As to digital works it\r\nalters the \"traditional contours of copyright protection\" in a\r\nway that affects \"copyright's built-in free speech safeguards.\"\r\nThat is what the Farmers' Tale was all about. Perhaps one day,\r\nin a case not involving a Norwegian teenager, a hacker magazine\r\nrun by a long-haired editor with an Orwellian nom de plume, and\r\nan obscure technology that is accused of posing apocalyptic\r\nthreats to the American film industry, that point will come out\r\nmore clearly.\r\n91\r\n\r\nBut the issue of speech regulation is only half of the story.\r\nIntellectual property rights over digital technologies affect\r\nnot only speech, but the framework of competition and markets as\r\nwell, as the next example makes clear.\r\n92\r\n\r\nThe Apple of Forbidden Knowledge:\r\nThe DMCA and Competition\r\n93\r\n\r\nYou could tell it was a bizarre feud by the statement Apple\r\nissued, one strangely at odds with the Californian Zen-chic the\r\ncompany normally projects. \"We are stunned that RealNetworks has\r\nadopted the tactics and ethics of a hacker to break into the\r\niPod, and we are investigating the implications of their actions\r\nunder the DMCA and other laws.\"15\r\n94\r\n\r\nWhat vile thing had RealNetworks done? They had developed a\r\nprogram called Harmony that would allow iPod owners to buy songs\r\nfrom Real's Music Store and play them on their own iPods. That's\r\nit. So why all the outrage? It turns out that like the story of\r\nDeCSS, this little controversy has a lot to teach us about the\r\nlandscape of intellectual property disputes, about the mental\r\ntopography of the high-tech economy. But where the DeCSS case\r\nwas a war of metaphors around the boundaries of freedom of\r\nexpression, the iPod story is about ways in which intellectual\r\nproperty marks the limits of competition.\r\n95\r\n\r\nApple iPods can be used to store all kinds of material, from\r\nword processing documents to MP3 files. If you want to use these\r\npopular digital music players to download copy-protected music,\r\nthough, you have only one source: Apple's iTunes service, which\r\noffers songs at 99 cents a pop in the United States, 79 pence in\r\nthe United Kingdom. If you try to download copy-protected\r\nmaterial from any other service, the iPod will refuse to play\r\nit. Or at least, that had been the case until Real managed to\r\nmake their Harmony service compatible.\r\n96\r\n\r\nReal's actions meant that consumers had two sources of copy-\r\nprotected music for their iPods. Presumably all the virtues of\r\ncompetition, including improved variety and lowered prices,\r\nwould follow. The iPod owners would be happy. But Apple was not.\r\nThe first lesson of the story is how strangely people use the\r\nmetaphors of tangible property in new-economy disputes. How\r\nexactly had Real \"broken into\" the iPod? It had not broken into\r\nmy iPod, which is after all my iPod. If I want to use Real's\r\nservice to download music to my own device, where's the breaking\r\nand entering?\r\n97\r\n\r\nWhat Real had done was make the iPod \"interoperable\" with\r\nanother format. If Boyle's word processing program can convert\r\nMicrosoft Word files into Boyle's format, allowing Word users to\r\nswitch programs, am I \"breaking into Word\"? Well, Microsoft\r\nmight think so, but most of us do not. So leaving aside the\r\nlegal claim for a moment, where is the ethical foul?\r\n98\r\n\r\nApple was saying (and apparently believed) that Real had broken\r\ninto something different from my iPod or your iPod. They had\r\nbroken into the idea of an iPod. (I imagine a small, platonic\r\nwhite rectangle, presumably imbued with the spirit of Steve\r\nJobs.) Their true sin was trying to understand the iPod so that\r\nthey could make it do things that Apple did not want it to do.\r\nAs an ethical matter, does figuring out how things work, in\r\norder to compete with the original manufacturer, count as\r\nbreaking and entering? In the strange netherworld between\r\nhardware and software, device and product, the answer is often a\r\nmorally heartfelt \"yes!\" I would stress \"morally heartfelt.\" It\r\nis true manufacturers want to make lots of money and would\r\nrather not have competitors. Bob Young of Red Hat claims \"every\r\nbusiness person wakes up in the morning and says 'how can I\r\nbecome a monopolist?' \" Beyond that, though, innovators actually\r\ncome to believe that they have the moral right to control the\r\nuses of their goods after they are sold. This isn't your iPod,\r\nit's Apple's iPod.\r\n99\r\n\r\nYet even if they believe this, we don't have to agree. In the\r\nmaterial world, when a razor manufacturer claims that a generic\r\nrazor blade maker is \"stealing my customers\" by making\r\ncompatible blades, we simply laugh. The \"hacking\" there consists\r\nof looking at the razor and manufacturing a blade that will fit.\r\nTo say this is somehow immoral seems laughable. Is the\r\nconclusion changed when the information about compatibility is\r\ninscribed in binary code and silicon circuits, rather than the\r\nmolded plastic of a razor cartridge? What if ensuring the \"fit\"\r\nbetween the two products is not a matter of making sure the new\r\nblades snugly connect to the razor but of making sure the\r\nsoftware embedded in my generic product sends the right code to\r\nthe original product in order to be recognized? Our moral\r\nintuitions are a little less confident here. All kinds of bad\r\npolicy can flourish in that area of moral uncertainty.\r\n100\r\n\r\nThis leads us to the law. Surely Apple's suggestion that the\r\nDMCA might prohibit what Real had done is as baseless as their\r\nmoral argument? In the United States, the answer is \"probably,\"\r\nat least if the courts continue in the direction they are\r\ncurrently taking, but it is a closer call than you would think.\r\nInternationally, the answer is even less certain. That is where\r\nthe iPod war provides its second new-economy lesson. Think for a\r\nmoment about the way that the law shapes the business choices in\r\nthis dispute.\r\n101\r\n\r\nIn a competitive market, Apple would choose whether to make the\r\niPod an open platform, able to work with everyone's music\r\nservice, or to try to keep it closed, hoping to extract more\r\nmoney by using consumers' loyalty to the hardware to drive them\r\nto the tied music service. If they attempted to keep it closed,\r\ncompetitors would try to make compatible products, acting like\r\nthe manufacturers of generic razor blades or printer cartridges.\r\n102\r\n\r\nThe war would be fought out on the hardware (and software)\r\nlevel, with the manufacturer of the platform constantly seeking\r\nto make the competing products incompatible, to bad-mouth their\r\nquality, and to use fear, uncertainty, and doubt to stop\r\nconsumers from switching. (Apple's actual words were: \"When we\r\nupdate our iPod software from time to time, it is highly likely\r\nthat Real's Harmony technology will cease to work with current\r\nand future iPods.\") Meanwhile the competitors would race to\r\nuntangle the knots as fast as the platform manufacturer could\r\ntie them. If the consumers got irritated enough they could give\r\nup their sunk costs and switch to another product altogether.\r\n103\r\n\r\nAll of this seems fine, even if it represents the kind of\r\nsocially wasteful arms race that led critics of capitalism to\r\nprophesy its inevitable doom. Competition is good and\r\ncompetition will often require interoperability. But what do we\r\nmean by competition? Is it competition if I assassinate your\r\nemployees or poison the food in your restaurant? If I trespass\r\non your land in order to sell a competing product? If I break\r\ninto your safe to steal your trade secrets, use my monopoly\r\nposition in the market to impose resale price agreements, or\r\nviolate your patent? It is the law that draws the line between\r\ncompetition and theft, between virtuous competitive imitation\r\nand illicit \"piracy.\"\r\n104\r\n\r\nSometimes we need to give innovators property rights that allow\r\nthem to prevent second-comers from free riding on their efforts.\r\nWe have to do so because it is necessary to encourage future\r\ninnovation. On the other hand, sometimes we not only allow the\r\nsecond-comer to free ride, we positively encourage it, believing\r\nthat this is an integral part of competition and that there are\r\nadequate incentives to encourage innovation without the state\r\nstepping in. Intellectual property policy, indeed a large part\r\nof the policy behind all property rights, is about drawing the\r\nline between the two situations. Too far in one direction and\r\ninnovation suffers because potential investors realize good\r\nideas will immediately be copied. Too far in the other direction\r\nand monopolies hurt both competition and future innovation.\r\n105\r\n\r\nImagine you are the first person to invest in getting the public\r\nto eat burritos for breakfast, or to place a petrol station at a\r\ncertain crossroads, or to clip papers together with a folded bit\r\nof wire. In each case we give you some property rights. The\r\nfast-food vendor may own a trademarked phrase or jingle that the\r\npublic learns to associate with his product. Since the patent\r\noffice issued a patent for the sealed and crimped \"peanut butter\r\nand jelly\" sandwich I described at the beginning of the book,\r\neven a patent is not out of the question if your disgusting\r\nconcoction is sufficiently novel and nonobvious. But we should\r\nnot allow you to have a patent over all burritos, or burritos\r\nfor breakfast, still less over the idea of fast food. As for the\r\npaper clip maker, there might be a trademark over the particular\r\npaper clip, but the idea of folding wire to secure paper stays\r\nin the public domain. The owner of the petrol station gets\r\nphysical ownership of the land, but cannot stop a second-comer\r\nfrom setting up shop across the road, even if the first-comer's\r\nlabor, capital, and effort proved that the location is a good\r\none. We positively encourage follow-on imitation in those cases.\r\n106\r\n\r\nNow how about the case in point? What does Apple get in the way\r\nof property rights? Think back to my description of the\r\nintellectual property system in Chapter 1. They can get patents\r\nover those aspects of the iPod--both hardware and software--that\r\nare sufficiently innovative. Patents are what we use to protect\r\ninventions. They also get a copyright over the various pieces of\r\nsoftware involved. That protects them only against someone who\r\ncopies their code, not someone who writes new software to do the\r\nsame thing. Copyrights are what we use to protect original\r\nexpression. They get rights under trademark law over the name\r\nand perhaps parts of the design of the product--maybe the\r\ndistinctive look of the iPod--though that is a bit more complex.\r\nAll of these rights, plus being the first to break into the\r\nmarket in a big way, the brilliance of the design, and the tight\r\nintegration between the hardware and the service, produce a\r\nformidable competitive advantage. The iPod is a very good\r\nproduct.\r\n107\r\n\r\nNow if a competitor infringes any of Apple's rights, for example\r\nby making a literal copy of the code, using their trademark in a\r\nway the law does not allow, or infringing on one of their\r\npatents, then Apple can shut them down and extract hefty\r\ndamages. Quite right, too. But should they be able to prevent\r\nsomeone from making an interoperable product, provided they do\r\nnot violate any of these existing rights in the process? Laws\r\nlike the DMCA make that question more complicated.\r\n108\r\n\r\nNowadays, there is software in many, many more products than you\r\nwould imagine. Your watch, your phone, your printer, your\r\nthermostat, your garage door opener, your refrigerator, your\r\nmicrowave, your television--the odds are that if you bought them\r\nin the last ten years, they have some software component. In the\r\n1970s the courts and Congress had concluded that software could\r\nbe copyrighted as original expression, like a song or a novel,\r\nas well as being patented when it was novel, nonobvious, and\r\nuseful. Frequently, different aspects of the same program will\r\nbe covered by copyright and by patent. But software is a machine\r\nmade of words, the machine of the digital age. That fact already\r\ncauses some problems for our competition policy. Will the\r\nexceptions and limitations designed to deal with a copyright\r\nover a novel work adequately when they are applied to Microsoft\r\nWindows? That issue was already unclear. With the DMCA, we have\r\nadded another crucial problem. Where there is copyrighted\r\nsoftware there can be digital fences around it. If the copyright\r\nowner can forbid people to cut these fences to gain access to\r\nthe software, then it can effectively enlarge its monopoly,\r\ncapture tied services, and prohibit generic competition.\r\n109\r\n\r\nIt was just this line of thought that led some other companies\r\nto do more than merely make threatening noises about the DMCA.\r\nLexmark makes printers. But it also makes lots of money off the\r\nreplacement ink or toner cartridges for those printers. In some\r\ncases, in fact, that is where printer companies make the\r\nmajority of their profits. As a result, they are not exactly\r\nkeen on generic replacements. Chamberlain makes garage door\r\nopener systems. But they also sell replacements for the\r\ncontrollers--the little devices that you use to trigger the door.\r\nLawyers from both of those firms looked at the DMCA and saw a\r\nchance to do something most companies would love to do; to make\r\ngeneric competition illegal. Lexmark designed their printer\r\nprogram so that it would not accept a toner cartridge unless it\r\nreceived the correct \"checksum\" or validation number. So far,\r\nthis looks no different from the razor manufacturer trying to\r\nmake it difficult to manufacture a compatible replacement blade.\r\nGeneric competitors now had to embed chips in their printer\r\ncartridges which would produce the correct code, otherwise they\r\nwould not work in Lexmark printers.\r\n110\r\n\r\nStatic Control Components is a North Carolina company that\r\nmanufactures chips whose main function is to send the correct\r\ncode to the printer program. With this chip implanted in them,\r\ngeneric cartridges would work in Lexmark printers. Lexmark's\r\nresponse could have been to change their program, rendering the\r\nchip obsolete, just as Apple could change the iTunes software to\r\nlock out Real Music's Rhapsody. Doing so would have been quite\r\nwithin their rights. Indeed it is a standard part of the\r\ninteroperability wars. Instead, Lexmark sued Static Controls,\r\nclaiming, among other things, a violation of the DMCA.16 Like\r\nApple in the press release I quoted earlier, Lexmark clearly saw\r\nthis as a kind of digital breaking and entering. This was their\r\nprinter, their printer program, their market for replacement\r\ncartridges. Static was just helping a bunch of cheats camouflage\r\ntheir generic cartridges as authentic Lexmark cartridges.\r\nTranslated into the legal language of the DMCA the claim is a\r\nlittle different, but still recognizable. Static was\r\n\"trafficking\" in a device that allowed the \"circumvention of a\r\ntechnical protection measure\" used to prevent \"access to a\r\ncopyrighted work\"--namely the computer program inside the\r\nprinter. That is behavior that the DMCA forbids.\r\n111\r\n\r\nThe garage door company, Chamberlain--who also claimed to be\r\nconcerned about the security of their garage doors--made a\r\nsimilar argument. In order to get the garage door to open, the\r\ngeneric replacement opener had to provide the right code to the\r\nprogram in the actual motor system. That program is copyrighted.\r\nThe code controls \"access\" to it. Suddenly, the manufacturers of\r\ngeneric printer cartridges and garage door openers start to look\r\nrather like Jon Johansen.\r\n112\r\n\r\nSurely the courts did not accept this argument? Bizarrely\r\nenough, some of them did--at least at first. But perhaps it was\r\nnot so bizarre. The DMCA was indeed a radical new law. It did\r\nshift the boundaries of power between intellectual property\r\nowners and others. And intellectual property rights are always\r\nabout restraining competition, defining what is legitimate and\r\nwhat is not--that is what they do. There was a respectable\r\nargument that these devices did in fact violate the DMCA. In\r\nfact, it was respectable enough to convince a federal judge. The\r\ndistrict court judge in the Lexmark case concluded that Lexmark\r\nwas likely to win on both the DMCA claim and on a more\r\ntraditional copyright claim and issued an injunction against\r\nStatic Control. In Skylink, the case involving garage door\r\nopeners, by contrast, the district court held that the universal\r\ngarage door opener did not violate the DMCA. Both cases were\r\nappealed and both appeals courts sided with the generic\r\nmanufacturers, saying that the DMCA did not prohibit this kind\r\nof access--merely making a computer program work the way it was\r\nsupposed to.\r\n113\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) heard\r\nthe Skylink appeal. In a remarkably far-reaching decision, the\r\ncourt effectively took many of the positions that Mr. Corley's\r\nlawyers had argued for in the DeCSS case, but they did so not to\r\nprotect speech, but to protect competition. In fact, they\r\nimplied that taking Chamberlain's side in the case would\r\nsilently overrule the antitrust statutes. They also interpreted\r\nthe new right created by the DMCA so as to add an implicit\r\nlimitation. In their construction, merely gaining access is not\r\nillegal; only gaining access for the purpose of violating the\r\ncopyright holders' rights violates the statute. The Reimerdes\r\ncourt had been willing to accept that the new access right\r\nallows a copyright holder to prohibit \"fair uses as well as\r\nfoul.\" When Chamberlain made the same argument as to their\r\ngarage door opener program, the CAFC was incredulous.\r\n114\r\n\r\n    Such an entitlement [as the one Chamberlain claims] would go\r\nfar beyond the idea that the DMCA allows copyright owner to\r\nprohibit \"fair uses . . . as well as foul.\" Reimerdes, 111 F.\r\nSupp. 2d at 304. Chamberlain's proposed construction would allow\r\ncopyright owners to prohibit exclusively fair uses even in the\r\nabsence of any feared foul use. It would, therefore, allow any\r\ncopyright owner, through a combination of contractual terms and\r\ntechnological measures, to repeal the fair use doctrine with\r\nrespect to an individual copyrighted work--or even selected\r\ncopies of that copyrighted work.17\r\n115\r\n\r\nThere are multiple ironies here. The CAFC rarely meets an\r\nintellectual property right it does not like. It has presided\r\nover a twenty-year expansion of American patent law that many\r\nscholars find indefensible. But when (for dubious jurisdictional\r\nreasons) it sorties beyond its traditional ambit of patent law,\r\nit is stunned by the potential expansiveness of the DMCA. Then\r\nthere is the comparison with the Reimerdes case. How interesting\r\nthat the First Amendment and concerns about free expression have\r\ncomparatively little bite when applied to the DMCA, but\r\nantitrust and concerns about competition require that we curtail\r\nit. After all, the heart of Mr. Johansen's argument was that he\r\nhad to write the DeCSS program in order to play his own DVDs on\r\nhis own computer--to get access to his own DVDs, just as the\r\npurchaser of a replacement garage door control is getting access\r\nto the program that operates his own garage door. Indeed, Mr.\r\nJohansen's criticism of CSS was that it allowed the movie\r\ncompanies, \"through a combination of contractual terms and\r\ntechnological measures, to repeal the fair use doctrine with\r\nrespect to an individual copyrighted work.\" Mr. Corley echoed\r\nthose claims.\r\n116\r\n\r\nOf course, the situations are not identical. The key limitation\r\nin Skylink is that the court saw no threat of \"foul use.\" The\r\nReimerdes court could see little else. On the other hand, the\r\nrulings are not easily reconciled. The Skylink court cannot\r\nimagine that Congress would want to give the copyright holder a\r\nnew \"property\" right to prevent access unconnected to any\r\nunderlying copyright violation.\r\n117\r\n\r\n    As we have seen, Congress chose to create new causes of\r\naction for circumvention and for trafficking in circumvention\r\ndevices. Congress did not choose to create new property rights.\r\n. . . Were we to interpret Congress's words in a way that\r\neliminated all balance and granted copyright owners carte\r\nblanche authority to preclude all use, Congressional intent\r\nwould remain unrealized.\r\n118\r\n\r\nYet, arguably, that is exactly what the Reimerdes decision does,\r\nprecisely because it focuses on enabling access alone, not\r\naccess for the purpose of violating one of the rights of the\r\ncopyright holder. The Reimerdes court saw a violation of the law\r\njust in cutting the wire or making a wire cutter. The Skylink\r\ncourt focused on whether the person cutting the wire was going\r\nto trespass once the cutting was done. In effect, the two courts\r\ndisagree on which of the options offered to the legislature in\r\nthe Farmers' Tale was actually enacted by Congress. Which court\r\nis correct? The Skylink decision strikes me as sensible. It also\r\nmakes the statute constitutionally much more\r\ndefensible--something that the Skylink court does not consider.\r\nBut in the process, it has to rewrite the DMCA substantially.\r\nOne should not presume that it will be this interpretation that\r\nwill triumph.\r\n119\r\n\r\nSUMMING UP: EXAGGERATIONS,\r\nHALF-TRUTHS, AND BIPOLAR DISORDERS\r\nIN TECHNOLOGY POLICY\r\n120\r\n\r\nLet me return to the question with which I began the chapter.\r\nFor many critics of contemporary intellectual property law, the\r\nDMCA is the very embodiment of all that is wrong. (I still\r\ncherish a friend's account of British protesters outside the\r\nAmerican Embassy in London singing \"D-M-C-A\" to the tune of the\r\nVillage People's \"YMCA\" and holding up signs calling for the\r\nlaw's repeal--to the great confusion of the diplomatic\r\npersonnel.) The critics conjure up a digital apocalypse--a world\r\nof perfect control achieved through legally backed digital\r\nfences, in which both speech and competition suffer, and where\r\ncitizens lose privacy, the privilege of fair use, and the right\r\nto criticize popular culture rather than simply consume it. In\r\ntheir view, the legal disaster is only exacerbated by bumbling\r\njudges who do not understand the technology and who are easily\r\nfooled by the doom-laden rhetoric of the content companies. The\r\nDMCA's supporters, on the other hand, think criticisms of the\r\nDMCA are overblown, that the dark tales of digital control are\r\neither paranoid delusions or tendentious exaggerations, and that\r\nfar from being excessive, the DMCA's provisions are not\r\nsufficient to control an epidemic of illicit copying. More\r\ndraconian intervention is needed. As for fair use, as I pointed\r\nout before, many of the DMCA's supporters do not think fair use\r\nis that important economically or culturally speaking. At best\r\nit is a \"loophole\" that copyright owners should have the right\r\nto close; certainly not an affirmative right of the public or a\r\nreserved limitation on the original property grant from the\r\nstate.\r\n121\r\n\r\nWho is right? Obviously, I disagree profoundly with the DMCA's\r\nsupporters. I wrote this book partly to explain--using Jefferson\r\nand Macaulay and the Sony case--what was wrong with their logic.\r\nIt would be both convenient and predictable for me to claim that\r\nthe DMCA is the intellectual property incarnation of the\r\nAntichrist. But it would not be true. In fact, I would not even\r\nput the DMCA in the top three of bad intellectual property\r\ninitiatives worldwide. And many of the fears conjured up about\r\nit are indeed overblown.\r\n122\r\n\r\nOf course, the critics have a point. The DMCA is a very badly\r\ndrafted law. As I have tried to show here, its key provisions\r\nwere probably unnecessary and are, in my view, unconstitutional.\r\nIf coupled with a number of other legal \"innovations\" favored by\r\nthe content industry, the DMCA could play a very destructive\r\nrole. In general, in fact, the Farmers' Tale is fairly accurate\r\nin describing both the origins of and the threats posed by the\r\nDMCA. Yet the single largest of those threats--the idea that the\r\nDMCA could be used to fence off large portions of the public\r\ndomain and to make the fair use provisions of the Copyright Act\r\nessentially irrelevant--is still largely a threat rather than a\r\nreality. In some cases, fair use rights are curtailed. But for\r\nmost citizens and for the majority of media, the DMCA has had\r\nrelatively little effect. Digital rights management (DRM)\r\ncertainly exists; indeed it is all around us. You can see that\r\nevery time you try to play a DVD bought in another part of the\r\nworld, open an Adobe eBook, or copy a song you have downloaded\r\nfrom iTunes. But so far, the world of legally backed digital\r\nrights management has not brought about the worst of the\r\ndystopian consequences that some people, including me, feared\r\nmight result.\r\n123\r\n\r\nIn many cases, citizens simply reject digital rights management.\r\nThey will not buy products that use it. Attempts to introduce it\r\ninto music CDs, for example, have been a resounding failure. In\r\nother cases, DRM has not been used in ways that the critics\r\nfeared. There are genuine scandals, of course--cryptography\r\nresearch has been chilled, the DMCA has been turned to\r\nanticompetitive ends, and so on. It is also troubling to see\r\nfederal judges issuing injunctions not only against banned\r\nmaterial but also against those who link to the banned material.\r\nSomehow the blithe reassurance that this is consistent with the\r\nFirst Amendment fails to comfort one. But many of the evils\r\nprophesied for the DMCA remain as just that: prophecies.\r\n124\r\n\r\nThere are also entries on the positive side of the ledger. The\r\n\"safe-harbors\" that the DMCA gave Internet service providers and\r\nsearch services have been a vital and positive force in the\r\ndevelopment of the Internet. It may even be true that in some\r\ncases, such as iTunes, the DMCA did what its backers claimed it\r\nwould--encourage new provision of digital content by reassuring\r\nthe record companies that they could put their music online\r\nsurrounded by legally backed digital rights management.\r\n(Notably, however, the trend is now going the other way.\r\nCompanies are coming to realize that many consumers prefer, and\r\nwill pay more for, unprotected MP3 files.)\r\n125\r\n\r\nOf course, depending on your view of the music industry, that\r\nmight seem like a mixed blessing. One might also wonder if the\r\nsame consumer benefits might have been produced with a much less\r\nrestrictive law. But with the exception of a few important\r\nareas--such as cryptography research, where its effects are\r\nreported to be severe--I would have to say that the criticisms\r\nfocus too much on the DMCA, to the exclusion of the rest of the\r\nintellectual property landscape. Yes, the DMCA offers enormous\r\npotential for abuse, particularly in conjunction with some other\r\ndevelopments in intellectual property that I will discuss later,\r\nbut much of the abuse has not yet happened. Yet even if it never\r\ndid happen, the DMCA has important lessons to teach us.\r\n126\r\n\r\nIn this section I have tried to show how legal\r\nrules--particularly intellectual property rules--define the\r\nboundaries of legitimate competition. We used to assume that\r\nthis was principally the function of patent and trademark law,\r\nless so of copyright. Of course, copyright would affect\r\ncompetition in publishing and in the TV and movie industries,\r\nbut it hardly seemed central to competition policy in general.\r\nBut once courts and legislatures accepted that software is\r\ncopyrightable, that assessment changed. The levers and cogs of\r\nthe machines of the modern economy are forged out of ones and\r\nzeros instead of steel and brass. In that situation, copyright\r\nis central to the competition policy of a high-tech economy.\r\n127\r\n\r\nAs the Apple case shows, our moral intuitions about competition\r\nare going to be cloudier in the world of digital content and\r\ncyberspace. The same is true of the law. Even in the material\r\nworld it can be hard to draw the line between the legitimate and\r\nruthless pursuit of commercial advantage and various forms of\r\nunfair competition, antitrust violations, and so on. But in the\r\nimmaterial world, the boundaries are even harder to draw. Is\r\nthis the digital equivalent of trespass or legitimate passage on\r\na public road that runs through your property? As I pointed out\r\nearlier, the constant analogies to physical property are likely\r\nto conceal as much as they reveal. Is this virtuous competitive\r\nimitation or illicit copying? We have strong, and by no means\r\ncoherent, moral and legal intuitions about the answers to such\r\nquestions. And our legal structure often gives us the raw\r\nmaterial to make a very good case for both sides of the\r\nargument.\r\n128\r\n\r\nInto this already troubled situation, with a set of rules\r\ndesigned for original expression in novels and poems being\r\napplied to machines made of computer code, we add the DMCA and\r\nits new rights of uncertain extent. Copyright had a well-\r\ndeveloped set of exceptions to deal with anticompetitive\r\nbehavior. Where the existing exceptions did not function, courts\r\ntended to turn to fair use as the universal method for patching\r\nthe system up--the duct tape of the copyright system. Without an\r\nevolving idea of fair use, copyright would overshoot its bounds\r\nas it was applied to new technologies and new economic\r\nconditions. Indeed that was the point of the Sony Axiom. The\r\nDMCA threw this system into disarray, into a war of competing\r\nmetaphors.\r\n129\r\n\r\nThe Skylink court sees monopolists being handed carte blanche to\r\nabolish the restraints on their monopolies. Competition policy\r\ndemands that we construe the DMCA narrowly. The Reimerdes court\r\nsees a virus masquerading as speech, a digital pandemic that\r\nmust be stopped at all costs by a draconian program of\r\nelectronic public health. Each proceeds to construe the statute\r\naround the reality they have created. It is by no means certain\r\nwhich metaphor will win the day, still less which resolution\r\nwill triumph in other countries that have passed versions of the\r\nDMCA. International attitudes toward speech, competition, and\r\nthe necessary exceptions in a copyright system vary widely. Yet\r\nbacked by the story of the Internet Threat, the content\r\ncompanies are already saying that we need to go further both\r\nnationally and internationally--introducing more technology\r\nmandates, requiring computers to have hardware that will only\r\nplay approved copyrighted versions, allowing content companies\r\nto hack into private computers in search of material they think\r\nis theirs, and so on. Remember the suggestion from the beginning\r\nof the chapter, that all cars be assumed to be getaway vehicles\r\nfor the felonious filchers of vegetables, and thus that they\r\nshould be fitted with radio beacons, have the size of their\r\ncargo space reduced, and so on? The Farmers' Tale continues to\r\nevolve.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 6: I Got a Mashup\r\n1\r\n\r\nSo far, I have talked about the root ideas of intellectual\r\nproperty. I have talked about its history, about the way it\r\ninfluences and is influenced by technology. I have talked about\r\nits effects on free speech and on competition. Until now,\r\nhowever, I have not described the way that it actually affects\r\nculture. This chapter aims to rectify the omission, looking at\r\nthe way copyright law handles one specific form of cultural\r\ncreation--music. It turns out that some of the problems\r\nidentified in Chapters 4 and 5 are not simply the result of a\r\nmismatch between old law and new technology, or the difficulties\r\nposed in applying copyright to software, to machines made of\r\nwords. The same issues appear at the heart of a much older\r\ncultural tradition.\r\n2\r\n\r\nThis is the story of a song and of that song's history. But it\r\nis also a story about property and race and art, about the way\r\ncopyright law has shaped, encouraged, and prohibited music over\r\nthe last hundred years, about the lines it draws, the boundaries\r\nit sets, and the art it forbids.\r\n3\r\n\r\nMusic is hard for copyright law to handle. If one had to\r\nrepresent the image of creativity around which copyright law and\r\npatent law, respectively, are built, patent law's model of\r\ncreativity would be a pyramid and copyright law's a fountain, or\r\neven an explosion.\r\n4\r\n\r\nIn patent law, the assumption is that technological development\r\nconverges. Two engineers from two different countries tend to\r\nproduce similar ways of catching mice or harnessing the power of\r\nsteam. There are a limited number of good ways of accomplishing\r\na technical task. In addition, technological progress is assumed\r\nto be incremental. Each development builds on the ones behind\r\nit. Based on this image, patent law makes a series of decisions\r\nabout what gets covered by property rights, for how long, how to\r\nhandle \"subsequent improvements,\" and so on. Patent rights last\r\nfor a short time, not only to lower costs to consumers, but\r\nbecause we want to build on the technology inventors have\r\ncreated as soon as possible, without getting their permission.\r\nEven during the patent term, subsequent \"improvers\" get their\r\nown rights and can bargain with the original patent holder to\r\nshare the profits.\r\n5\r\n\r\nCopyright's assumptions are different. Copyright began with\r\ntexts, with creative expression. Here the assumption is\r\n(generally) that there are infinite possibilities, that two\r\nwriters will not converge on the same words, and that the next\r\ngeneration of storytellers does not need to take the actual\r\n\"stuff\" that copyright covers in order to make the next play or\r\nnovel. (It may be because of this image that so few policy\r\nmakers seem to worry that copyright now lasts for a very long\r\ntime.) Subsequent \"improvements\" of copyrighted material are\r\ncalled derivative works, and without the rights holder's\r\npermission, they are illegal. Again, the assumption seems to be\r\nthat you can just write your own book. Do not claim you need to\r\nbuild on mine.\r\n6\r\n\r\nOf course, each of these pictures is a caricature. The reality\r\nis more complex. Copyright can make this assumption more easily\r\nbecause it does not cover ideas or facts--just their expression.\r\n\"Boy meets girl, falls in love, girl dies\" is not supposed to be\r\nowned. The novel Love Story is. It is assumed that I do not need\r\nErich Segal's copyrighted expression to write my own love story.\r\nEven if literary creativity does converge around standard\r\ngenres, plots, and archetypes, it is assumed that those are in\r\nthe public domain, leaving future creators free to build their\r\nown work without using material that is subject to copyright. We\r\ncould debate the truth of that matter for literature: the\r\nexpansion of copyright's ambit to cover plotlines and characters\r\nmakes it more questionable. Certainly many recognized forms of\r\ncreativity, such as the pastiche, the collage, the literary\r\nbiography, and the parody need extensive access to prior\r\ncopyrighted work. But regardless of how well we think the image\r\nof individual creativity fits literature, it fits very poorly in\r\nmusic where so much creativity is recognizably more collective\r\nand additive, and where much of the raw material used by\r\nsubsequent creators is potentially covered by copyright.\r\n7\r\n\r\nSo how does the accretive process of musical creativity fare in\r\nthe modern law and culture of copyright? How would the great\r\nmusical traditions of the twentieth century--jazz, soul, blues,\r\nrock--have developed under today's copyright regime? Would they\r\nhave developed at all? How does the law apply to the new\r\nmusicians, remixers, and samplers who offer their work on the\r\nInternet? Do the lines it draws fit with our ethics, our\r\ntraditions of free speech and commentary, our aesthetic\r\njudgments? It would take a shelf of books to answer such\r\nquestions definitively. In this chapter, all I can do is suggest\r\nsome possibilities--using the history of a single song as my case\r\nstudy.\r\n8\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n9\r\n\r\nOn August 29th, 2005, a hurricane made landfall in Louisiana.\r\nThe forecasters called it \"Hurricane Katrina,\" quickly shortened\r\nto \"Katrina\" as its story took over the news. The New Orleans\r\nlevees failed. Soon the United States and then most of the world\r\nwas watching pictures of a flooded New Orleans, seeing pleading\r\ncitizens--mainly African-American--and a Keystone Cops response by\r\nthe Federal Emergency Management Agency. The stories from New\r\nOrleans became more and more frightening. There were tales not\r\nonly of natural disaster--drownings, elderly patients trapped in\r\nhospitals--but of a collapse of civilization: looting, murder and\r\nrape, stores being broken into with impunity, rescue helicopters\r\nfired upon, women and children sexually assaulted in the\r\nconvention center where many of the refugees huddled. Later, it\r\nwould turn out that many, perhaps most, of these reports were\r\nuntrue, but one would not have guessed that from the news\r\ncoverage.\r\n10\r\n\r\nThe television played certain images over and over again.\r\nPeople--again, mainly African-Americans--were portrayed breaking\r\ninto stores, pleading from rooftops, or later, when help still\r\nhad not arrived, angrily gesturing and shouting obscenities at\r\nthe camera.\r\n11\r\n\r\nAs the disaster unfolded in slow motion, celebrities began\r\nappearing in televised appeals to raise money for those who had\r\nbeen affected by the storm. Kanye West, the hip hop musician,\r\nwas one of them. Appearing on NBC on September 2, with the\r\ncomedian Mike Myers, West started out seeming quietly upset.\r\nFinally, he exploded.\r\n12\r\n\r\n    I hate the way they portray us in the media. You see a black\r\nfamily, it says, \"They're looting.\" You see a white family, it\r\nsays, \"They're looking for food.\" And, you know, it's been five\r\ndays [waiting for federal help] because most of the people are\r\nblack. . . . So anybody out there that wants to do anything that\r\nwe can help--with the way America is set up to help the poor, the\r\nblack people, the less well-off, as slow as possible. I mean,\r\nthe Red Cross is doing everything they can. We already realize a\r\nlot of people that could help are at war right now, fighting\r\nanother way--and they've given them permission to go down and\r\nshoot us!\r\n\r\n13\r\n\r\nMyers, who, according to the Washington Post, \"looked like a guy\r\nwho stopped on the tarmac to tie his shoe and got hit in the\r\nback with the 8:30 to LaGuardia,\" filled in with some comments\r\nabout the possible effect of the storm on the willingness of\r\nLouisiana citizens to live in the area in the future. Then he\r\nturned back to West, who uttered the line that came to epitomize\r\nKatrina for many people around the world, and to infuriate a\r\nlarge number of others. \"George Bush doesn't care about black\r\npeople!\" Myers, the Post wrote, \"now look[ed] like the 8:30 to\r\nLaGuardia turned around and caught him square between the\r\neyes.\"1 In truth, he did appear even more stunned than before,\r\nsomething I would not have thought possible.\r\n14\r\n\r\nIn Houston, Micah Nickerson and Damien Randle were volunteering\r\nto help New Orleans evacuees at the Astrodome and Houston\r\nConvention Center during the weekend of September 3. They, too,\r\nwere incensed both by the slowness of the federal response to\r\nthe disaster and by the portrayal of the evacuees in the media.\r\nBut Mr. Nickerson and Mr. Randle were not just volunteers, they\r\nwere also a hip-hop duo called \"The Legendary K.O.\" What better\r\nway to express their outrage than through their art? An article\r\nin the New York Times described their response.\r\n15\r\n\r\n    \"When they got to Houston, people were just seeing for the\r\nfirst time how they were portrayed in the media,\" said Damien\r\nRandle, 31, a financial adviser and one half of the Legendary\r\nK.O. \"It was so upsetting for them to be up on a roof for two\r\ndays, with their kids in soiled diapers, and then see themselves\r\nportrayed as looters.\" In response, Mr. Randle and his partner,\r\nMicah Nickerson, wrote a rap based on the stories of the people\r\nthey were helping. On Sept. 6, Mr. Nickerson sent Mr. Randle an\r\ninstant message containing a music file and one verse, recorded\r\non his home computer. Mr. Randle recorded an additional verse\r\nand sent it back, and 15 minutes later it was up on their Web\r\nsite: www.k-otix.com.2\r\n16\r\n\r\nThe song was called \"George Bush Doesn't Care About Black\r\nPeople\" (also referred to as \"George Bush Doesn't Like Black\r\nPeople\"). Appropriately, given that Mr. West was the one to come\r\nup with the phrase, the song was built around Mr. West's \"Gold\r\nDigger.\" Much of the melody was sampled directly from the\r\nrecording of that song. Yet the words were very different. Where\r\n\"Gold Digger\" is about a predatory, sensual, and materialist\r\nwoman who \"take[s] my money when I'm in need\" and is a \"triflin'\r\nfriend indeed,\" The Legendary K.O.'s song is a lyrical and\r\nprofane condemnation of the response to Katrina by both the\r\ngovernment and the media. Here is a sample:\r\n17\r\n\r\n    Five days in this motherf__ attic\r\n    Can't use the cellphone I keep getting static\r\n    Dying 'cause they lying instead of telling us the truth\r\n    Other day the helicopters got my neighbors off the roof\r\n    Screwed 'cause they say they coming back for us too\r\n    That was three days ago, I don't see no rescue\r\n    See a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do\r\n    Since God made the path that I'm trying to walk through\r\n    Swam to the store, tryin' to look for food\r\n    Corner store's kinda flooded so I broke my way through\r\n    I got what I could but before I got through\r\n    News say the police shot a black man trying to loot\r\n    (Who!?) Don't like black people\r\n    George Bush don't like black people\r\n    George Bush don't like black people\r\n\r\n18\r\n\r\nThis chapter is the story of that song. \"George Bush Doesn't\r\nCare About Black People\" is the end (for the moment) of a line\r\nof musical borrowing. That borrowing extends far beyond Kanye\r\nWest's song \"Gold Digger.\" \"Gold Digger\" is memorable largely\r\nbecause it in turn borrows from an even older song, a very\r\nfamous one written half a century before and hailed by many as\r\nthe birth of soul music. It is in the origins of that song that\r\nwe will start the trail.\r\n19\r\n\r\nI GOT A WOMAN\r\n20\r\n\r\nIn 1955, Ray Charles Robinson, better known as Ray Charles,\r\nreleased a song called \"I Got a Woman.\" It was a defining moment\r\nin Charles's musical development. Early in his career he had\r\nunashamedly modeled himself on Nat King Cole.\r\n21\r\n\r\n    I knew back then that Nat Cole was bigger than ever. Whites\r\ncould relate to him because he dealt with material they\r\nunderstood, and he did so with great feeling. Funny thing, but\r\nduring all these years I was imitating Nat Cole, I never thought\r\ntwice about it, never felt bad about copying the cat's licks. To\r\nme it was practically a science. I worked at it, I enjoyed it, I\r\nwas proud of it, and I loved doing it. He was a guy everyone\r\nadmired, and it just made sense to me, musical and commercial\r\nsense, to study his technique. It was something like when a\r\nyoung lawyer--just out of school--respects an older lawyer. He\r\ntries to get inside his mind, he studies to see how he writes up\r\nall his cases, and he's going to sound a whole lot like the\r\nolder man--at least till he figures out how to get his own shit\r\ntogether. Today I hear some singers who I think sound like me.\r\nJoe Cocker, for instance. Man, I know that cat must sleep with\r\nmy records. But I don't mind. I'm flattered; I understand. After\r\nall, I did the same thing.3\r\n22\r\n\r\nIn the early 50s Charles decided that he needed to move away\r\nfrom Cole's style and find his own sound, \"sink, swim or die.\"\r\nBut as with any musician, \"his own sound\" was the product of a\r\nnumber of musical traditions--blues and gospel particularly. It\r\nis out of those traditions that \"I Got a Woman\" emerged; indeed\r\nit is that combination that causes it to be identified as one of\r\nthe birthplaces of soul music.\r\n23\r\n\r\nAccording to the overwhelming majority of sources, \"I Got a\r\nWoman\" stems from a fairly overt piece of musical\r\nborrowing--Charles reworded the hymn \"Jesus Is All the World to\r\nMe\"--sometimes referred to as \"My Jesus Is All the World to Me.\"\r\n24\r\n\r\n    Musically, soul denotes styles performed by and for black\r\naudiences according to past musical practices reinterpreted and\r\nredefined. During its development, three performers played\r\nsignificant roles in shaping its sound, messages, and\r\nperformance practice: Ray Charles, James Brown, and Aretha\r\nFranklin. If one can pinpoint a moment when gospel and blues\r\nbegan to merge into a secular version of gospel song, it was in\r\n1954 when Ray Charles recorded \"My Jesus Is All the World to\r\nMe,\" changing its text to \"I Got A Woman.\"4\r\n25\r\n\r\nThat story is repeated in the biography on Charles's Web site.\r\n\"Charles reworded the gospel tune 'Jesus Is All the World to Me'\r\nadding deep church inflections to the secular rhythms of the\r\nnightclubs, and the world was never the same.\"5 Michael Lydon,\r\nCharles's most impressive biographer, simply reports that \"Jesus\r\nIs All the World to Me\" is described as the song's origin in\r\nanother published source,6 and this origin is cited repeatedly\r\nelsewhere in books, newspaper articles, and online,7 though the\r\nmost detailed accounts also mention Renald Richard, Charles's\r\ntrumpeter, who is credited with co-writing the song.8\r\n26\r\n\r\nTo secular ears, \"Jesus Is All the World to Me\" is a plodding\r\npiece of music with a mechanical, up-and-down melodic structure.\r\nIt conjures up a bored (and white) church audience, trudging\r\nthrough the verses, a semitone flat, while thinking about Sunday\r\nlunch rather than salvation. It is about as far removed as one\r\ncould be from the syncopated beat and amorous subject matter of\r\n\"I Got a Woman.\" The hymn was the product of Will Lamartine\r\nThompson--a severe-looking fellow with a faint resemblance to an\r\nelderly Doc Holliday--who died in 1909 and is buried in the same\r\nplace he was born, East Liverpool, Ohio. But the words have an\r\nearnestness to them that gives life to the otherwise uninspired\r\nverse.\r\n27\r\n\r\n    Jesus is all the world to me, my life, my joy, my all;\r\n    He is my strength from day to day, without Him I would fall.\r\n    When I am sad, to Him I go, no other one can cheer me so;\r\n    When I am sad, He makes me glad, He's my Friend.\r\n28\r\n\r\nReading those words, one can understand the sincerity that made\r\nMr. Thompson spurn commercial publishers for his devotional\r\nmusic, instead founding his own publishing house (also in East\r\nLiverpool) to make sure that his hymns reached the people. I can\r\nquote as much of the song as I want without worrying about legal\r\nconsequences because the copyright on Mr. Thompson's lyrics has\r\nexpired. So has the copyright over the music. The song was\r\npublished in 1904. Copyright had only been extended to musical\r\ncompositions in 1881. Like all copyrights back then, copyright\r\nover music lasted for only twenty-eight years, with a possible\r\nextension for another fourteen. If Ray Charles did indeed reword\r\nit fifty years later, he was doing nothing illegal. It had been\r\nin the public domain for at least eight years, and probably for\r\ntwenty. Now maybe Charles's genius was to hear in this hymn, or\r\nin a syncopated gospel version of this hymn, the possibility of\r\na fusion of traditions which would itself become a new\r\ntradition--soul. Or perhaps his genius was in knowing a good\r\nidea--Richard's--when he heard it, and turning that idea into the\r\nbeginnings of its own musical genre.\r\n29\r\n\r\nSoul is a fusion of gospel on the one hand and rhythm and blues\r\non the other. From gospel, soul takes the call-and-response\r\npattern of preacher and congregation and the wailing vocals of\r\nsomeone \"testifying\" to their faith. From rhythm and blues it\r\ntakes the choice of instruments, some of the upbeat tempo, and\r\nthe distinctly worldly and secular attitude to the (inevitable)\r\ntroubles of life. Musicologists delight in parsing the patterns\r\nof influence further; R&B itself had roots in \"jump music\" and\r\nthe vocal style of the \"blues shouters\" who performed with the\r\nbig bands. It also has links to jazz. Gospel reaches back to\r\nspirituals and so on.\r\n30\r\n\r\nAs with all music, those musical traditions can be traced back\r\nor forward in time, the net of influence and borrowing widening\r\nas one goes in either direction. In each, one can point to\r\ndistinctive musical motifs--the chords of the twelve-bar blues,\r\nor the flattened fifth in bebop. But musical traditions are also\r\ndefined by performance styles and characteristic sounds: the\r\nwarm guitar that came out of the valve amplifiers of early funk,\r\nthe thrashing (and poorly miked) drums of '80s punk, or the\r\ntinny piano of honky-tonk. Finally, styles are often built\r\naround \"standards\"--classic songs of the genre to which an almost\r\nobligatory reference is made. My colleague, the talented\r\ncomposer Anthony Kelley, uses Henry Louis Gates's term\r\n\"signifyin' \" to describe the process of showing you are\r\nembedded in your musical tradition by referring back to its\r\nclassics in your playing. In jazz, for example, one demonstrates\r\none's rootedness in the tradition by quoting a standard, but\r\nalso one's virtuosity in being able to trim it into a particular\r\neight-bar solo, beginning and ending on the right note for the\r\ncurrent moment in the chord progression. \"I Got Rhythm\" and\r\n\"Round Midnight\" are such songs for jazz. (The chord changes of\r\n\"I Got Rhythm\" are so standard, they are referred to as \"the\r\nrhythm changes\"--a standard basis for improvisation.) And to\r\nstretch the connections further, as Kelley points out, the\r\nhaunting introduction to \"Round Midnight\" is itself remarkably\r\nsimilar to Sibelius's Fifth Symphony.\r\n31\r\n\r\nThrough all these layers of musical borrowing and reference, at\r\nleast in the twentieth century in the United States, runs the\r\nseam of race. When white musicians \"borrowed\" from soul to make\r\n\"blue-eyed soul,\" when Elvis took songs and styles from rhythm\r\nand blues and turned them into rockabilly, a process of racial\r\ncleansing went on. Styles were adapted but were cleansed of\r\nthose elements thought inappropriate for a larger white\r\naudience. Generally, this involved cutting some of the rawer\r\nsensuality, removing racially specific verbal and musical\r\nreferences, and, for much of the century, cutting the African-\r\nAmerican artists out of the profits in the process.\r\n32\r\n\r\nThere is another irony here. Styles formed by patterns of\r\ngleeful borrowing, formed as part of a musical commons--the blues\r\nof the Mississippi Delta, for example--were eventually\r\ncommercialized and \"frozen\" into a particular form by white\r\nartists. Sometimes those styles were covered with intellectual\r\nproperty rights which denied the ability of the original\r\ncommunity to \"borrow back.\" In the last thirty or forty years of\r\nthe century, African-American artists got into the picture too,\r\nunderstandably embracing with considerable zeal the commercial\r\nopportunities and property rights that had previously been\r\ndenied to them. But aside from the issue of racial injustice,\r\none has to consider the question of sustainability.\r\n33\r\n\r\nIn other work, I have tried to show how a vision of intellectual\r\nproperty rights built around a notion of the romantic author can\r\nsometimes operate as a one-way valve vis-à-vis traditional and\r\ncollective creative work.9 There is a danger that copyright will\r\ntreat collectively created musical traditions as unowned raw\r\nmaterial, but will then prevent the commercialized versions of\r\nthose traditions--now associated with an individual artist--from\r\ncontinuing to act as the basis for the next cycle of musical\r\nadaptation and development. One wonders whether jazz, blues,\r\nR&B, gospel, and soul would even have been possible as musical\r\nstyles if, from their inception, they had been covered by the\r\nstrong property rights we apply today. That is a question I want\r\nto return to at the end of this chapter.\r\n34\r\n\r\nMusical styles change over time and so do their techniques of\r\nappropriation. Sometimes musical generations find their\r\nsuccessors are engaging in different types of borrowing than\r\nthey themselves engaged in. They do not always find it\r\ncongenial. It is striking how often musicians condemn a younger\r\ngeneration's practice of musical appropriation as theft, while\r\nviewing their own musical development and indebtedness as benign\r\nand organic. James Brown attacked the use of his guitar licks or\r\nthe drum patterns from his songs by hip-hop samplers, for\r\nexample, but celebrated the process of borrowing from gospel\r\nstandards and from rhythm and blues that created the \"Hardest\r\nWorking Man in Show Business\"--both the song and the musical\r\npersona. To be sure, there are differences between the two\r\npractices. Samplers take a three-second segment off the actual\r\nrecording of \"Funky Drummer,\" manipulate it, and turn it into a\r\nrepeating rhythm loop for a hip-hop song. This is a different\r\nkind of borrowing than the adaptation of a chord pattern from a\r\ngospel standard to make an R&B hit. But which way does the\r\ndifference cut as a matter of ethics, aesthetics, or law?\r\n35\r\n\r\nCharles himself came in for considerable criticism for his\r\nfusion of gospel intonations and melodic structures with the\r\nnightclub sound of rhythm and blues, but not because it was\r\nviewed as piracy. It was viewed as sacrilegious.\r\n36\r\n\r\n    Charles totally removed himself from the polite music he had\r\nmade in the past. There was an unrestrained exuberance to the\r\nnew Ray Charles, a fierce earthiness that, while it would not\r\nhave been unfamiliar to any follower of gospel music, was almost\r\nrevolutionary in the world of pop. Big Bill Broonzy was\r\noutraged: \"He's crying, sanctified. He's mixing the blues with\r\nthe spirituals. He should be singing in a church.\"10\r\n37\r\n\r\nCharles disagreed. \"You can't run away from yourself. . . . What\r\nyou are inside is what you are inside. I was raised in the\r\nchurch and was around blues and would hear all these musicians\r\non the jukeboxes and then I would go to revival meetings on\r\nSunday morning. So I would get both sides of music. A lot of\r\npeople at the time thought it was sacrilegious but all I was\r\ndoing was singing the way I felt.\"11 Why the charge of\r\nsacrilege? Because beyond the breach of stylistic barriers, the\r\nrelationships Charles described did not seem to belong in\r\nchurch.\r\n38\r\n\r\n\"I Got a Woman\" tells of a woman, \"way over town,\" who is good\r\nto the singer--very good, in fact. She gives him money when he is\r\nin need, is a \"kind of friend indeed,\" even saves her \"early\r\nmorning loving\" just for him (and it is tender loving at that).\r\nIn the third verse we learn she does not grumble, fuss, or run\r\nin the streets, \"knows a woman's place is right there now in the\r\nhome,\" and in general is a paragon of femininity. Gender roles\r\naside, it is a fabulous song, from the elongated \"We-e-ell . .\r\n.\" in Charles's distinctive tones, to the momentary hesitation\r\nthat heightens the tension, all the way through the driving beat\r\nof the main verses and the sense that a gospel choir would have\r\nfit right in on the choruses, testifying ecstatically to the\r\nvirtues of Charles's lady friend. Charles liked women--a lot of\r\nwomen, according to his biographers--and a lot of women liked him\r\nright back. That feeling comes through very clearly from this\r\nsong.\r\n39\r\n\r\nI would like to quote the song lyrics for you, just as I did the\r\nwords of the hymn, but that requires a little more thought.\r\nCharles's song was released in 1955. By that time, the copyright\r\nterm for a musical composition was twenty-eight years, renewable\r\nfor another twenty-eight if the author wished. (Later, the\r\ntwenty-eight-year second term would be increased to forty-seven\r\nyears. Still later, the copyright term would be extended to life\r\nplus seventy years, or ninety-five years for a \"work for hire.\"\r\nSound recordings themselves would not be protected by federal\r\nlaw until the early 1970s.) Anyone who wrote or distributed a\r\nsong under the \"28 ??28\" system was, in effect, saying \"this is\r\na long enough protection for me,\" enough incentive to create.\r\nThus, we could have assumed that \"I Got a Woman\" would enter the\r\npublic domain in either 1983 or, if renewed, 2011. Unfortunately\r\nfor us, and for a latter-day Ray Charles, the copyright term has\r\nbeen extended several times since then, and each time it was\r\nalso extended retrospectively. Artists, musicians, novelists,\r\nand filmmakers who had created their works on the understanding\r\nthat they had twenty-eight or fifty-six or seventy-five years of\r\nprotection now have considerably more. This was the point raised\r\nin Chapter 1. Most of the culture of the twentieth century,\r\nproduced under a perfectly well-functioning system with much\r\nshorter copyright terms, is still locked up and will be for many\r\nyears to come.\r\n40\r\n\r\nIn the case of \"I Got a Woman,\" it is now about fifty years\r\nsince the song's release--the same length of time as between\r\nThompson's hymn and Charles's alleged \"rewording.\" If the words\r\nand music were properly copyrighted at the time of its\r\npublication, and renewed when appropriate, the copyright still\r\nhas forty-five years to run. No one will be able to \"reword\" \"I\r\nGot a Woman\" and use it to found a new genre, or take\r\nsubstantial portions of its melody, until the year 2050. The\r\nfreedoms Ray Charles says he used to create his song are denied\r\nto his successors until nearly a century after the song's\r\nrelease. (As we will see in a moment, this put certain\r\nconstraints on Kanye West.)\r\n41\r\n\r\nWould it truly be a violation of copyright for me to quote the\r\nmiddle stanza in a nonfiction book on copyright policy? Not at\r\nall. It is a classic \"fair use.\" In a moment I will do so. But\r\nit is something that the publisher may well fuss over, because\r\ncopyright holders are extremely aggressive in asking for\r\npayments for the slightest little segment. Copyright holders in\r\nmusic and song lyrics are among the most aggressive of the lot.\r\nYear after year academics, critics, and historians pay fairly\r\nsubstantial fees (by our standards) to license tiny fragments of\r\nsongs even though their incorporation is almost certainly fair\r\nuse. Many of them do not know the law. Others do, but want to\r\navoid the hassle, the threats, the nasty letters. It is simpler\r\njust to pay.\r\n42\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, these individual actions have a collective\r\nimpact. One of the factors used to consider whether something is\r\na fair use is whether or not there is a market for this\r\nparticular use of a work. If there is, it is less likely to be a\r\nfair use to quote or incorporate such a fragment. As several\r\ncourts have pointed out, there is a powerful element of\r\ncircularity here. You claim you have a right to stop me from\r\ndoing x--quoting two lines of your three-verse song in an\r\nacademic book, say. I say you have no such right and it is a\r\nfair use. You say it is not a fair use because it interferes\r\nwith your market--the market for selling licenses for two-\r\nsentence fragments. But when do you have such a market? When you\r\nhave a right to stop me quoting the two-sentence fragment unless\r\nI pay you. Do you have such a right? But that is exactly what we\r\nare trying to decide! Is it a fair use or not? The existence of\r\nthe market depends on it not being a fair use for me to quote it\r\nwithout permission. To say \"I would have a market if I could\r\nstop you doing it, so it cannot be a fair use, so I can stop\r\nyou\" is perfectly circular.\r\n43\r\n\r\nHow do we get out of the circle? Often the court will look to\r\ncustoms and patterns in the world outside. Do people accept this\r\nas a market? Do they traditionally pay such fees? Thus, if a lot\r\nof people choose to pay for quotes that actually should have\r\nbeen fair use, the \"market\" for short quotes will begin to\r\nemerge. That will, in turn, affect the boundaries of fair use\r\nfor the worse. Slowly, fair use will constrict, will atrophy.\r\nThe hypertrophied permissions culture starts as myth, but it can\r\nbecome reality.\r\n44\r\n\r\nIn any event, Ray Charles had no need of fair use to make \"I Got\r\na Woman\" because the hymn his biography claims it is based on\r\nwas in the public domain. But is that the real source? I can\r\nhear little resemblance. As I researched the origins of \"I Got a\r\nWoman,\" I found claims that there was a different source, a\r\nmysterious song by the Bailey Gospel Singers, or the Harold\r\nBailey Gospel Singers, called \"I've Got a Savior.\"12 The\r\nColumbia Records gospel catalogue even provided a catalogue\r\nnumber.13 There was such a song, or so it seemed. But there the\r\nresearch stalled. The exemplary librarians at Duke University\r\nMusic Library could find no trace. Catalogues of published\r\nrecords showed nothing. Inquiries to various music librarian\r\nlistservs also produced no answer. There was a man called Harold\r\nBailey, who sang with a group of gospel singers, but though\r\nseveral Internet postings suggested he was connected to the\r\nsong, his biography revealed he would have been only thirteen at\r\nthe time. The Library of Congress did not have it. Eventually,\r\nJordi Weinstock--a great research assistant who demonstrated\r\nwillingness to pester anyone in the world who might conceivably\r\nhave access to the recording--hit gold. The Rodgers and\r\nHammerstein Archives of Recorded Sound at the New York Public\r\nLibrary for the Performing Arts had a copy--a 78 rpm vinyl record\r\nby the Bailey Gospel Singers with \"Jesus Is the Searchlight\" on\r\nthe B-side. Our library was able to obtain a copy on\r\ninterlibrary loan from the helpful curator, Don McCormick.\r\n45\r\n\r\nIt sounds like the same song. Not the same words, of course: the\r\nintroduction is different and the Bailey Gospel Singers lack the\r\nboom-chicky-boom backing of Charles's version, but the central\r\nmelody is almost exactly the same. When the Bailey Gospel\r\nSingers sing \"Keeps me up / Keeps me strong / Teach me right /\r\nWhen I doing wrong / Well, I've got a savior / Oh what a savior\r\n/ yes I have,\" the melody, and even the intonation, parallel\r\nCharles singing the equivalent lines: \"She gimme money / when\r\nI'm in need / Yeah she's a kind of / friend indeed / I've got a\r\nwoman / way over town / who's good to me.\"\r\n46\r\n\r\nTrue, some of the lyrical and rhythmic patterns of \"I've Got a\r\nSavior\" are older still. They come from a spiritual called\r\n\"Ain't That Good News,\" dating from 1940, which rehearses all\r\nthe things the singer will have in the Kingdom of Heaven--a harp,\r\na robe, slippers (!), and, finally, a savior. The author of\r\n\"I've Got a Savior\" was, like all the artists discussed here,\r\ntaking a great deal from a prior musical tradition.\r\nNevertheless, Charles's borrowing is particularly overt and\r\ndirect. The term \"rewording\" is appropriate. So far as I can\r\nsee, whether or not he also relied on a fifty-year-old hymn, Ray\r\nCharles appears to have taken both the melody and lyrical\r\npattern of his most famous hit from a song that was made a mere\r\nthree or four years earlier.\r\n47\r\n\r\nLike many 78 rpm records, this one was sold without liner notes.\r\nThe center of the record provides the only details. It gives the\r\nname of the track and the band and a single word under the song\r\ntitle, \"Ward\"--presumably the composer. \"Ward\" might be Clara\r\nWard of the Ward Singers, a talented gospel singer and\r\nsongwriter who became Aretha Franklin's mentor and who had her\r\nown music publishing company.\r\n48\r\n\r\nThere is a particular reason to think that she might have\r\nwritten the song: Ray Charles clearly liked to adapt her music\r\nto secular ends. We know that he \"reworked\" Ward's gospel\r\nclassic \"This Little Light of Mine\" into \"This Little Girl of\r\nMine.\" Ward reportedly was irritated by the practice. So far as\r\nwe know, the copying of the music did not annoy her because she\r\nviewed it as theft, but because she viewed it as an offense\r\nagainst gospel music.\r\n49\r\n\r\n    Charles is now starting to get criticism from some gospel\r\nmusic performers for secularizing gospel music and presenting it\r\nin usual R&B venues. Most adamant in her misgivings is Clara\r\nWard who complains about \"This Little Girl Of Mine\" being a\r\nreworking of \"This Little Light Of Mine\" (which it is), as a\r\nslap against the gospel field.14\r\n50\r\n\r\nThis stage of Charles's career is described, rightly, as the\r\nmoment when his originality bursts forth, where he stops\r\nimitating the smooth sounds of Nat King Cole and instead\r\nproduces the earthy and sensual style that becomes his\r\ntrademark--his own sound. That is true enough; there had been\r\nnothing quite like this before. Yet it was hardly original\r\ncreation out of nothing. Both Charles himself and the\r\nmusicological literature point out that \"his own sound,\" \"his\r\nstyle,\" is in reality a fusion of two prior genres--rhythm and\r\nblues and gospel. But looking at the actual songs that created\r\nsoul as a genre shows us that the fusion goes far beyond merely\r\na stylistic one. Charles makes some of his most famous songs by\r\ntaking existing gospel classics and reworking or simply\r\nrewording them. \"I've Got a Savior\" becomes \"I Got a Woman.\"\r\n\"This Little Light of Mine\" becomes \"This Little Girl of Mine.\"\r\n51\r\n\r\nThe connection is striking: two very recent gospel songs,\r\nprobably by the same author, from which Charles copies the\r\nmelody, structure, pattern of verses, even most of the title--in\r\neach case substituting a beloved sensual woman for the beloved\r\ndeity. Many others have noticed just how closely Charles based\r\nhis songs on gospel tunes, although the prevalence of the story\r\nthat \"I Got a Woman\" is derived from an early-twentieth-century\r\nhymn caused most to see only the second transposition, not the\r\nfirst.15 Borrowing from a fifty-year-old hymn and changing it\r\nsubstantially in the process seems a little different from the\r\nrepeated process of \"search and replace\" musical collage that\r\nCharles performed on the contemporary works of Clara Ward.\r\n52\r\n\r\nIf I am right, Charles's \"merger\" of gospel and blues relied on\r\na very direct process of transposition. The transposition was\r\nnot just of themes: passion for woman substituted for passion\r\nfor God. That is a familiar aspect of soul.16 It is what allows\r\nit to draw so easily from gospel's fieriness and yet coat the\r\nreligion with a distinctly more worldly passion. Sex, sin, and\r\nsyncopation--what more could one ask? But Charles's genius was to\r\ntake particular songs that had already proved themselves in the\r\nchurch and on the radio, and to grab large chunks of the melody\r\nand structure. He was not just copying themes, or merging\r\ngenres, he was copying the melodies and words from recent songs.\r\n53\r\n\r\nWas this mere musical plagiarism, then? Should we think less of\r\nRay Charles's genius because we find just how closely two of the\r\ncanonical songs in the creation of soul were based on the work\r\nof his contemporaries? Hardly. \"I Got a Woman\" and \"This Little\r\nGirl of Mine\" are simply brilliant. Charles does in fact span\r\nthe worlds of the nightclub at 3 a.m. on Sunday morning and the\r\nchurch later that day, of ecstatic testimony and good old-\r\nfashioned sexual infatuation. But the way he does so is a lot\r\nmore like welding, or bricolage, than it is like designing out\r\nof nothing or creating anew while distantly tugged by mysterious\r\nmusical forces called \"themes\" or \"genres.\" Charles takes bits\r\nthat have been proven to work and combines them to make\r\nsomething new. When I tell engineers or software engineers this\r\nstory, they nod. Of course that is how creation works. One does\r\nnot reinvent the wheel, or the method of debugging, so why\r\nshould one reinvent the hook, the riff, or the melody? And yet\r\nCharles's creation does not have the degraded artistic quality\r\nthat is associated with \"mere\" cut-and-paste or collage\r\ntechniques. The combination is greater than the sum of its\r\nparts. If Charles's songs do not fit our model of innovative\r\nartistic creativity, perhaps we need to revise the model--at\r\nleast for music--rather than devaluing his work.\r\n54\r\n\r\nWhen I began this study, it seemed to me that the greatest\r\nchallenge to copyright law in dealing with music was preventing\r\nrights from \"creeping,\" expanding from coverage of a single song\r\nor melody to cover essential elements of genre, style, and\r\ntheme. In effect, we needed to apply the Jefferson Warning to\r\nmusic, to defeat the constant tendency to confuse intellectual\r\nproperty with real property, and to reject the attempts to make\r\nthe right holder's control total. My assumption was that all we\r\nneeded to do was to keep open the \"common space\" of genre and\r\nstyle, and let new artists create their new compositions out of\r\nthe material in that commons and gain protection over them. In\r\nmany ways, Charles's work lies at the very core of the stuff\r\ncopyright wishes to promote. It is not merely innovative and\r\nexpressive itself, it also helped form a whole new genre in\r\nwhich other artists could express themselves. But to create this\r\nwork, Charles needed to make use of a lot more than just genres\r\nand styles created by others. He needed their actual songs. If\r\nthe reactions of Clara Ward and Big Bill Broonzy are anything to\r\ngo by, they would not have given him permission. To them, soul\r\nwas a stylistic violation, a mingling of the sacred with the\r\nprofane. If given a copyright veto over his work, and a culture\r\nthat accepts its use, Ward might well have exercised it. Like\r\nthe disapproving heirs that Macaulay talked about, she could\r\nhave denied us a vital part of the cultural record. Control has\r\na price.\r\n55\r\n\r\nDid Ray Charles commit copyright infringement? Perhaps. We would\r\nhave to find if the songs are substantially similar, once we had\r\nexcluded standard forms, public domain elements, and so on. I\r\nwould say that they are substantially similar, but was the\r\nmaterial used copyright-protected expression?\r\n56\r\n\r\nThe Copyright Office database shows no entry for \"I've Got a\r\nSavior.\" This is not conclusive, but it seems to indicate that\r\nno copyright was ever registered in the work. In fact, it is\r\nquite possible that the song was first written without a\r\ncopyright notice. Nowadays that omission would be irrelevant.\r\nWorks are copyrighted as soon as they are fixed in material\r\nform, regardless of whether any copyright notice is attached. In\r\n1951, however, a notice was required when the work was\r\npublished, and if one was not put on the work, it passed\r\nimmediately into the public domain. However, later legislation\r\ndecreed that the relevant publication was not of the record, but\r\nof the notation. If the record were pressed and sold without a\r\ncopyright notice, the error could be corrected. If a lead sheet\r\nor a sheet music version of \"I've Got a Savior\" had been\r\npublished without notice or registration, it would enter the\r\npublic domain. It is possible that this happened. Intellectual\r\nproperty rights simply played a lesser role in the 1950s music\r\nbusiness than they do today, both for better and for worse.\r\nLarge areas of creativity operated as copyright-free zones. Even\r\nwhere copyrights were properly registered, permission fees were\r\nnot demanded for tiny samples. While bootlegged recordings or\r\ndirect note-for-note copies might well draw legal action,\r\nborrowing and transformation were apparently viewed as a normal\r\npart of the creative process. In some cases, artists simply did\r\nnot use copyright. They made money from performances. Their\r\nrecords might receive some kind of protection from state law.\r\nThese protections sufficed.\r\n57\r\n\r\nBut the lack of protection also had a less attractive and more\r\nracially skewed side. African-American artists were less likely\r\nto have the resources and knowledge necessary to navigate the\r\nsystem of copyright. For both black and white artists, whatever\r\nrights there were moved quickly away from the actual creators\r\ntoward the agents, record companies, and distributors. They\r\nstill do. But African-American musicians got an even worse deal\r\nthan their white counterparts. True, the copyright system was\r\nonly an infinitesimal part of that process. A much larger part\r\nwas the economic consequences of segregation and racial\r\napartheid. But copyright was one of the many levers of power\r\nthat were more easily pulled by white hands. This is an\r\nimportant point because the need to end that palpable racial\r\ninjustice is sometimes used to justify every aspect of our\r\ncurrent highly legalized musical culture. About that conclusion,\r\nI am less convinced.\r\n58\r\n\r\nIn any event, it is possible that the musical composition for\r\n\"I've Got a Savior\" went immediately into the public domain. If\r\nthat were the case, Ray Charles could draw on it, could change\r\nit, could refine it without permission or fee. Certainly there\r\nis no mention of seeking permission or paying fees in any of the\r\nhistories of \"I Got a Woman.\" Indeed, the only question of\r\nrectitude Charles was focused on was the stylistic one. Was it\r\nappropriate to mix gospel and R&B, devotional music and secular\r\ndesire? Charles and Richard seemed to see the process of\r\nrewording and adapting as just a standard part of the musician's\r\ncreative process. The only question was whether these two styles\r\nwere aesthetically or morally suited, not whether the borrowing\r\nitself was illegal or unethical. So, whether they drew on a hymn\r\nthat had fallen into the public domain after the expiration of\r\nits copyright term, or a gospel song for which copyright had\r\nnever been sought, or whether they simply took a copyrighted\r\nsong and did to it something that no one at the time thought was\r\nlegally inappropriate, Renald Richard and Ray Charles were able\r\nto create \"I Got a Woman\" and play a significant role in\r\nfounding a new musical genre--soul.\r\n59\r\n\r\nOne thing is clear. Much of what Charles and Richard did in\r\ncreating their song would be illegal today. Copyright terms are\r\nlonger. Copyright protection itself is automatic. Copyright\r\npolicing is much more aggressive. The musical culture has\r\nchanged into one in which every fragment must be licensed and\r\npaid for. The combination is fatal to the particular pattern of\r\nborrowing that created these seminal songs of soul.\r\n60\r\n\r\nThat should give us pause. I return to the ideas of the\r\nJefferson Warning from Chapter 2 and the Sony Axiom from Chapter\r\n4. Copyright is not an end in itself. It has a goal: to promote\r\nthe progress of cultural and scientific creativity. That goal\r\nrequires rights that are less than absolute. As Jessica Litman\r\npoints out, building in the intellectual space is different from\r\nbuilding in the physical space. We do not normally dismantle old\r\nhouses to make new ones. This point is not confined to music.\r\nEarlier I quoted Northrop Frye: \"Poetry can only be made out of\r\nother poems; novels out of other novels. All of this was much\r\nclearer before the assimilation of literature to private\r\nenterprise.\"17 The question is, how big are the holes we need to\r\nleave in the private rights? How large a commons do we need to\r\noffer to future creators?\r\n61\r\n\r\nRay Charles's creation of \"I Got a Woman\" is only one case. By\r\nitself, it proves nothing. Yet, if we find that the seminal,\r\ngenre-creating artworks of yesteryear would be illegal under the\r\nlaw and culture of today, we have to ask ourselves \"is this\r\nreally what we want?\" What will the music of the future look\r\nlike if the Clara Wards and Will Lamartine Thompsons of today\r\ncan simply refuse to license on aesthetic grounds or demand\r\npayment for every tiny fragment? Tracing the line further back,\r\nit is fascinating to wonder whether gospel, blues, and jazz\r\nwould have developed if musical motifs had been jealously\r\nguarded as private property rather than developed as a kind of\r\nmelodic and rhythmic commons. Like most counterfactuals, that\r\none has no clear answer, but there is substantial cause for\r\nskepticism. If copyright is supposed to be promoting innovation\r\nand development in culture, is it doing its job?\r\n62\r\n\r\nAN INDUSTRY OF GOLD DIGGERS?\r\n63\r\n\r\nFifty years after \"I Got a Woman\" was written, Kanye West\r\nreleased \"Gold Digger\" on the album Late Registration. Mr. West\r\nis an interesting figure in rap. At first he was shunned because\r\nhis clean-cut looks and preppy clothing ran against the gangster\r\nimage that often dominates the music. It is just hard imagining\r\nMr. West delivering a line like Rakim's \"I used to be a stick-up\r\nkid, so I think of all the devious things I did\" with a straight\r\nface. (Still less \"Stop smiling, ain't nothin' funny, nothing\r\nmoves but the money.\") Perhaps partly as a result, his lyrics\r\nare oddly bipolar in their views about exaggerated masculinity\r\nand the misogyny that sometimes accompanies it.\r\n64\r\n\r\nFor the song, Mr. West recruited Jamie Foxx, who had played Ray\r\nCharles in the movie Ray. Showing an impressive expanse of oiled\r\nchest, Mr. Foxx imitates Charles's style and the melody of \"I\r\nGot a Woman\" to provide the lyrical chorus to \"Gold Digger.\" \"I\r\nGot a Woman\" anchors West's song. It provides its melodic hook.\r\nIt breaks up the rap with a burst of musical nostalgia. But Mr.\r\nWest's gold digger is very different from Ray Charles's woman\r\nfriend. This woman does not give money when the singer is in\r\nneed. She takes his money when he is in need and is a \"triflin'\r\nfriend indeed.\" Mr. Charles had a friend who gave him tender\r\nmorning loving. Jamie Foxx sings of a mercenary gold digger who\r\ndigs on him. When Mr. West adds the rap verses to the song, we\r\nget a perfect caricature of such a person, uninterested in any\r\nman who is broke, dragging around four kids and an entourage,\r\ninsisting all of them be entertained at her boyfriend's expense,\r\nand wielding unfounded paternity suits like a proprietary\r\nbusiness method. Mr. West's repeated disclaimer \"I ain't sayin'\r\nshe's a gold digger\" is unconvincing, because both the words of\r\nthe introduction and the implicit message of the rap tell us she\r\nis. We even get the absurd image of a man who is playing on the\r\nwinning side in the Super Bowl but driving a Hyundai, so\r\nfinancially demanding is his girlfriend. At several points the\r\nsong descends into ludicrous--and perhaps conscious--self-mockery,\r\nas it explores the concerns of the rich African-American\r\ncelebrity male. My favorite line is \"If you ain't no punk,\r\nholler 'We want prenup!!' \" The audience obliges. It sounds like\r\nassertiveness training for show business millionaires.\r\n65\r\n\r\nIt would be hard to get a feminist role model out of either \"I\r\nGot a Woman\" or \"Gold Digger.\" One offers the feminine virtues\r\nof modesty and fidelity, but magically combines them with\r\nwantonness where the singer is concerned and an open checkbook.\r\nThe other is a parody of the self-assertive economic actor, as\r\nrapacious as any multinational, who uses her sexuality for\r\nprofit. Put them together and you have bookends--male fantasy and\r\nmale nightmare. Was that Mr. West's point? Perhaps. The song\r\nitself takes several sly turns. The gold digger dogging Mr. West\r\nis used as part of a homily to black women on how to treat their\r\n(noncelebrity) black men. They should stick with their man\r\nbecause his ambition is going to take him from mopping floors to\r\nthe fryers, from a Datsun to a Benz. It seems that Mr. West is\r\ngetting a little preachy, while slamming the actual social\r\nmobility available to black men. Moving from floor cleaning to\r\nfrying chicken is not actually going to provide a Mercedes. But\r\nhe immediately undercuts that tone twice, once by acknowledging\r\nthe boyfriend's likely infidelity and again by saying that even\r\nif the black woman follows his homily, \"once you get on, he\r\nleave yo' ass for a white girl.\"\r\n66\r\n\r\nMr. West has a tendency to make sudden turns like this in his\r\nlyrics--ironically upsetting the theme he has just set up. So it\r\nis not hard to imagine that he deliberately used a fragment of\r\nCharles's song, not just because it sounded good but to contrast\r\nthe image of the fantasy woman from Charles's 1950s soul, who is\r\nfaithful, sensual, and always willing to offer a loan, with an\r\nimage from today's rap--sexually predatory and emasculating women\r\nwho are uninterested in men except as a source of money. Even\r\nthe retro cover of the single, with its 1950s-style pinup\r\ndrawing of a white model, seems to draw the connection. Did he\r\nuse Charles's song precisely because of these clashing cultural\r\nsnapshots? Perhaps, or perhaps he just liked the tune. In any\r\nevent, the contrast is striking. When it was released, Charles's\r\nsong was seen as a sacrilegious depiction of sensuality and the\r\nwoman was decried as a harlot. Compared to the woman in Mr.\r\nWest's song, she sounds like a Girl Scout. It is also a little\r\ndepressing. Ray Charles was neither an egalitarian metrosexual\r\nnor a Prince Charming where women were concerned--anything but.\r\nBut as I said before, you do get a sense that he liked\r\nwomen--however unrealistic or two-dimensional their portrayal. It\r\nis hard to get that sense from \"Gold Digger.\"\r\n67\r\n\r\nWas Mr. West legally required to ask permission--and pay, if\r\nnecessary--to use a fragment of \"I Got a Woman\" for his chorus?\r\nThe longest single piece of borrowing occurs in the\r\nintroduction: twenty-six words and their accompanying music.\r\n\"She takes my money, when I'm in need, oh she's a triflin'\r\nfriend indeed. Oh she's a gold digger, way over town, who digs\r\non me.\" As I pointed out, the lyrics from Charles's song present\r\na very different story. \"She gimme money / when I'm in need /\r\nYeah she's a kind of / friend indeed / I've got a woman / way\r\nover town / who's good to me.\" But even if the message is the\r\nopposite, the musical borrowing is direct. It is also extensive.\r\nDuring Mr. West's rap, the entire background melody is a loop of\r\nJamie Foxx singing the Ray Charles-inspired melody in the\r\nbackground. During the song, Mr. Foxx returns to words that are\r\ncloser to Charles's original: \"She gimme money, when I'm in\r\nneed,\" a refrain that is conspicuously at odds with the woman\r\nbeing described by Mr. West. That eight-bar loop of a Ray\r\nCharles melody runs throughout Kanye West's song.\r\n68\r\n\r\nMr. West is very successful, so the fragment of the song was\r\n\"cleared\"--payment was made to Charles's estate. It is\r\nfascinating to think of what might have happened if Charles's\r\nheirs had refused. After all, one could see West's song as a\r\ncrude desecration of Charles's earlier work, rather than a good-\r\nhumored homage. Since this is not a \"cover version\" of the\r\nsong--one which does not change its nature and thus operates\r\nunder the statutory licensing scheme--Charles's heirs would have\r\nthe right to refuse a licensing request. Unlike Clara Ward, it\r\nis clear that Charles's heirs have the legal power to say no, to\r\nprevent reuse of which they disapprove.\r\n69\r\n\r\nWas West legally required to license? Would all this amount to a\r\ncopyright violation? It is worth running through the analysis\r\nbecause it gives a beautiful snapshot of the rules with which\r\ncurrent law surrounds musical creation.\r\n70\r\n\r\nToday, a song is generally covered by at least two copyrights.\r\nOne covers the musical composition--the sheet music and the\r\nlyrics--and the other the particular sound recording of that\r\ncomposition. Just as there are two kinds of copyrights, so there\r\nare at least two kinds of borrowings that copyright might be\r\nconcerned with. First, one musical composition might infringe\r\nanother. Thus, for example, a court found that George Harrison\r\n\"subconsciously\" based his song \"My Sweet Lord\" on the melody of\r\n\"He's So Fine\" by the Chiffons.\r\n71\r\n\r\nHow much does it take to infringe? That is a difficult question.\r\nThe law's standard is \"substantial similarity,\" but not every\r\nkind of similarity counts. Minimal or de minimis copying of tiny\r\nfragments is ignored. Certain styles or forms have become\r\nstandards; for example, the basic chord structure of the twelve-\r\nbar blues or the habit of introducing instruments one at a time,\r\nfrom quietest to loudest. There are only so many notes--and so\r\nmany ways to rearrange them; inevitably any song will be similar\r\nto some other. Yet that cannot mean that all songs infringe\r\ncopyright. Finally, even where there is substantial similarity\r\nof a kind that copyright is concerned with, the second artist\r\nmay claim \"fair use\"--for parody or criticism, say. Copyright\r\nlaw, in other words, has tried to solve the problem with which I\r\nbegan the chapter. Because much of musical creativity is organic\r\nand collective and additive, because it does use prior musical\r\nexpression, some copyright decisions have tried to carve out a\r\nrealm of freedom for that creativity, using doctrines with names\r\nsuch as scènes à faire, merger, and fair use. This is yet\r\nanother example of judges trying to achieve the balance that\r\nthis book is all about--between the realm of the protected and\r\nthe public domain--recognizing that it is the balance, not the\r\nproperty side alone, that allows for new creativity.\r\n72\r\n\r\nThe second type of potential infringement comes when someone\r\nuses a fragment of the earlier recording as part of the later\r\none, actually copying a portion of the recording itself and\r\nusing it in a new song. One might imagine the same rules would\r\nbe applied--de minimis copying irrelevant, certain standard forms\r\nunprotected, and so on. And one would be wrong. In a case called\r\nBridgeport Music, which I will discuss in a moment, the Court of\r\nAppeals ruled that taking even two notes of a musical recording\r\ncounts as potentially actionable copying. Where recordings are\r\nconcerned, in other words, there is almost no class of copying\r\nso minimal that the law would ignore it. This is a terrible\r\ndecision, at least in my opinion, likely to be rejected by other\r\nCircuits and perhaps even eventually by the Supreme Court. But\r\nfor the moment, it is a case that samplers have to deal with.\r\n73\r\n\r\nHow does Kanye West fare under these rules? He may sample from\r\nthe actual recording of Mr. Charles's song. It is hard to tell.\r\nHe certainly copies portions of the melody. That means we have\r\nto look at the copyright in the musical composition--the words\r\nand the music of \"I Got a Woman.\" For a copyright infringement,\r\none needs a valid copyright and evidence of copying, the amount\r\ncopied needs to be more than an insignificant fragment,\r\nsubstantial similarity is required, and the similarity has to be\r\nbetween the new work and the elements of the original that are\r\nactually protected by copyright. Elements taken from the public\r\ndomain, standard introductions, musical clichés, and so forth,\r\ndo not get included in the calculation of similarity. Finally,\r\nthe copier can claim \"fair use\"--that his borrowing is legally\r\nprivileged because it is commentary, criticism, parody, and so\r\non.\r\n74\r\n\r\nDoes Charles, or his record company, have a valid copyright in\r\nthe musical composition? One huge problem in copyright law is\r\nthat it is remarkably hard to find this out. Even with the best\r\nwill in the world, it is hard for an artist, musician, or\r\nteacher to know what is covered by copyright and what is not.\r\nNowadays, all works are copyrighted as soon as they are fixed,\r\nbut at the time \"I Got a Woman\" was written one had to include a\r\ncopyright notice or the song went immediately into the public\r\ndomain. The Copyright Office database shows no copyright over\r\nthe words and music of \"I Got a Woman.\" There are copyrights\r\nover a variety of recordings of the song. If Mr. West is using a\r\nfragment of the recording, these would affect him. But the\r\nmelody? It is possible that the underlying musical composition\r\nis in the public domain. Finding out whether it is or is not\r\nwould probably cost one a lot of money.\r\n75\r\n\r\nSuppose that Mr. Charles has complied with all the formalities.\r\nThe words and music were published with a copyright notice. A\r\ncopyright registration was filed and renewed. Does Mr. West\r\ninfringe this copyright? That is where the discovery of the\r\nBailey Gospel Singers recording is potentially so important.\r\nCharles only gets a copyright in his original creation. Those\r\nelements taken from the public domain (if \"I've Got a Savior\"\r\nwas indeed in the public domain) or from other copyrighted songs\r\ndo not count. The irony here is that the elements that Kanye\r\nWest borrows from Ray Charles are almost exactly the same ones\r\nRay Charles borrows from the Bailey Gospel Singers. \"I've got a\r\nsavior, Oh what a savior\" becomes \"I got a woman, way over town\"\r\nbecomes \"There's a Gold Digger, way over town.\" And of course,\r\nthe music behind those words is even more similar. When The\r\nLegendary K.O. reached for Kanye West's song in order to\r\ncriticize Mr. Bush, they found themselves sampling Jamie Foxx,\r\nwho was copying Ray Charles, who was copying the Bailey Gospel\r\nSingers, who themselves may have borrowed their theme from an\r\nolder spiritual.\r\n76\r\n\r\nGEORGE BUSH DOESN'T CARE . . .\r\n77\r\n\r\n  Five damn days, five long days\r\n  And at the end of the fifth he walking in like \"Hey!\"\r\n  Chilling on his vacation, sitting patiently\r\n  Them black folks gotta hope, gotta wait and see\r\n  If FEMA really comes through in an emergency\r\n  But nobody seem to have a sense of urgency\r\n  Now the mayor's been reduced to crying\r\n  I guess Bush said, \"N------'s been used to dying!\"\r\n  He said, \"I know it looks bad, just have to wait\"\r\n  Forgetting folks was too broke to evacuate\r\n  N------'s starving and they dying of thirst\r\n  I bet he had to go and check on them refineries first\r\n  Making a killing off the price of gas\r\n  He would have been up in Connecticut twice as fast . . .\r\n  After all that we've been through nothing's changed\r\n  You can call Red Cross but the fact remains that . . .\r\n  George Bush ain't a gold digger,\r\n  but he ain't f--ing with no broke n------s\r\n  \"George Bush Doesn't Care About Black People,\" The Legendary\r\n  K.O.\r\n78\r\n\r\nThe song \"George Bush Doesn't Care About Black People\" was an\r\nimmediate sensation. Hundreds of thousands of people downloaded\r\nit. Within days two different video versions had been made, one\r\nby Franklin Lopez and another by a filmmaker called \"The Black\r\nLantern.\" Both synchronized the lyrics of the song with news\r\nclips of the disaster and unsympathetic footage of President\r\nBush apparently ignoring what was going on. The effect was both\r\nhilarious and tragic. The videos were even more popular than the\r\nsong alone. The blogosphere was fascinated--entries were posted,\r\ne-mails circulated to friends with the usual \"you have to see\r\nthis!\" taglines. In fact, the song was so popular that it\r\nreceived the ultimate recognition of an Internet fad: the New\r\nYork Times wrote a story on it, setting the practice in\r\nhistorical context.\r\n79\r\n\r\n    In the 18th century, songwriters responded to current events\r\nby writing new lyrics to existing melodies. \"Benjamin Franklin\r\nused to write broadside ballads every time a disaster struck,\"\r\nsaid Elijah Wald, a music historian, and sell the printed lyrics\r\nin the street that afternoon. This tradition of responding\r\nculturally to terrible events had almost been forgotten, Mr.\r\nWald said, but in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, it may be\r\nmaking a comeback, with the obvious difference that, where\r\nFranklin would have sold a few song sheets to his fellow\r\nPhiladelphians, the Internet allows artists today to reach the\r\nwhole world.18\r\n80\r\n\r\nMr. Nickerson's and Mr. Randle's song started with Kanye West's\r\nwords--taken from the fundraiser with Mike Myers. \"George Bush\r\ndoesn't care about black people.\" From there it launched into\r\nthe song. The background melody comes almost entirely from a\r\nlooped, or infinitely repeated, version of the hook that Kanye\r\nWest and Jamie Foxx had in turn taken from Ray Charles: \"She\r\ngimme money, when I'm in need. I gotta leave.\" Against that\r\nbackground, The Legendary K.O. provide their profane and angry\r\ncommentary, part of which is excerpted above, with a chorus of\r\n\"George Bush don't like black people,\" in case anyone had missed\r\nthe point.\r\n81\r\n\r\nThe videos differ in the issues they stress. Franklin Lopez's\r\nmovie is, rather pointedly given its theme, just black and\r\nwhite. He uses ornate captions pages, reminiscent of silent film\r\nfrom the 1920s, to make political points against the background\r\nof the song and the news footage. As the captions read \"Katrina\r\nRapidly Approaches,\" we cut to a shot of the hurricane. \"The\r\nPresident Ponders on What to Do.\" We have a shot of Mr. Bush\r\nplaying golf. \"I Think I'll Ride This One Out.\" Mr. Bush is\r\nshown relaxing on a golf cart, juxtaposed against pictures of\r\nAfrican-Americans wading through the floods. The captions add,\r\nas an afterthought, \"And Keep Dealing with the Brown People.\"\r\n(Pictures of soldiers shooting.) When FEMA's Michael Brown is\r\nshown--at the moment when Bush said \"Brownie, you are doing a\r\nhell of a job\"--the captions comment mockingly, \"The Horse Judge\r\nto the Rescue.\"\r\n82\r\n\r\nMr. Lopez's video obviously tries to use The Legendary K.O.'s\r\nsong to make larger political arguments about the country. For\r\nexample, it asserts that \"in 2004 Bush diverted most of the\r\nfunds for the levees to the war in Iraq.\" Scenes reminiscent of\r\na Michael Moore documentary are shown. There are pictures of the\r\nIraq war, Halliburton signs, and shots of the president with a\r\nmember of the Saudi royal family. The captions accuse the\r\npresident of showing insensitivity and disdain to racial\r\nminorities. One summarizes the general theme: \"Since he was\r\nelected president, George Bush's policies have been less than\r\nkind toward Africans and Hispanics.\" Issues ranging from the\r\nresponse to the Darfur massacres, No Child Left Behind, and the\r\nattempted privatization of Social Security also make their\r\nappearance. The video concludes by giving the donation\r\ninformation for the Red Cross and saying that we are \"onto\"\r\nBush. A picture of a Klansman removing his hood is shown, with\r\nthe image manipulated so that the face revealed is Mr. Bush's.\r\n83\r\n\r\nThe Black Lantern's video is just as angry, and it uses some of\r\nthe same footage, but the themes it picks up are different. It\r\nstarts with a logo that parodies the FBI copyright warning shown\r\nat the beginning of movies: \"WARNING: Artist supports\r\nfilesharing. Please distribute freely.\" That dissolves into a\r\npicture of Kanye West and Mike Myers. West is speaking, somewhat\r\nawkwardly as he goes \"off script,\" and at first Mr. Myers is\r\nnodding, though he starts to look increasingly worried. West\r\nsays, \"I hate the way they portray us in the media. You see a\r\nblack family it says they are looting. You see a white family,\r\nit says they are looking for food.\" Finally, West says \"George\r\nBush doesn't care about black people\" and the camera catches\r\nMyers's mute, appalled reaction. Then the song begins. The film\r\ncuts repeatedly between a music video of Mr. Foxx as he sang the\r\nlines for \"Gold Digger\" and the news coverage of the debacle in\r\nNew Orleans. At one point the music pauses and a news anchor\r\nsays, \"You simply get chills when you look at these people. They\r\nare so poor. And so black.\" The song resumes. Here the message\r\nis simpler. The media coverage is biased and governmental\r\nattention slowed because of negative racial stereotypes and lack\r\nof concern about black people.\r\n84\r\n\r\nSome readers will find that this song and these videos capture\r\ntheir own political perspectives perfectly. They will love the\r\nbitterly ironic and obscene outrage at the government's failure,\r\nthe double standards of the press, and the disproportionate and\r\ncallously disregarded impact on the poor and black. Others will\r\nfind both song and films to be stupid, insulting, and\r\nreductionist--an attempt to find racial prejudice in a situation\r\nthat, at worst, was an example of good old-fashioned\r\ngovernmental incompetence. Still others will find the language\r\njust too off-putting to even think about the message. Whatever\r\nyour feelings about the content, I urge you to set them aside\r\nfor a moment. For better or worse, Mr. Bush just happened to be\r\npresident at the moment when the Internet was coming into its\r\nown as a method of distributing digitally remixed political\r\ncommentary, which itself has recently become something that\r\namateurs can do for pennies rather than an expensive activity\r\nreserved to professionals. The point is that whatever rules we\r\napply to deal with \"George Bush Doesn't Care About Black People\"\r\nwill also apply to the next video that alleges corruption in a\r\nDemocratic administration or that attacks the sacred cows of the\r\nleft rather than the right. How should we think about this kind\r\nof activity, this taking the songs and films and photos of\r\nothers and remixing them to express political, satirical,\r\nparodic, or simply funny points of view?\r\n85\r\n\r\nSAMPLING\r\n86\r\n\r\nLet us begin with the music. Unlike the other songs I have\r\ndiscussed here, with the possible exception of Mr. West's,\r\n\"George Bush Doesn't Care About Black People\" makes use of\r\ndigital samples of the work of others. In other words, this is\r\nnot merely about copying the tune or the lyrics. The reason that\r\nMr. Nickerson and Mr. Randle could make and distribute this song\r\nso fast (and so cheaply) is that they took fragments from the\r\nrecording of \"Gold Digger\" and looped them to form the\r\nbackground to their own rap. That was also part of the reason\r\nfor the positive public reaction. Kanye West (and Ray Charles\r\nand Clara Ward) are very talented musicians. West's song was\r\nalready all over the airwaves. The Legendary K.O. capitalized on\r\nthat, just as Benjamin Franklin capitalized on the familiarity\r\nof the songs he reworded. But where Franklin could only take the\r\ntune, The Legendary K.O. could take the actual ones and zeros of\r\nthe digital sound file.\r\n87\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, there are two types of copyright\r\nprotection over music. There is the copyright over the musical\r\ncomposition and, a much more recent phenomenon, the copyright\r\nover the actual recording. This song potentially infringes both\r\nof them.\r\n88\r\n\r\nReaders who came of age in the 1980s might remember the music of\r\nPublic Enemy and N.W.A.--a dense wall of sound on which rap\r\nlyrics were overlaid. That wall of sound was in fact made up of\r\nsamples, sometimes hundreds of tiny samples in a single track.\r\nRap and hip-hop musicians proceeded under the assumption that\r\ntaking a fragment of someone else's recording was as acceptable\r\nlegally (and aesthetically) as a jazz musician quoting a\r\nfragment of another tune during a solo. In both cases, the use\r\nof \"quotation\" is a defining part of the genre, a harmless or\r\neven complimentary homage. Or so they thought.\r\n89\r\n\r\nIn a 1991 case called Grand Upright, that idea was squashed.19\r\nThe rap artist Biz Markie had extensively sampled Gilbert\r\nO'Sullivan's song \"Alone Again (Naturally)\" for his own song\r\n\"Alone Again.\" The court could have applied the rules described\r\nearlier in this chapter, decided whether or not this was a large\r\nenough usage to make the second song substantially similar to\r\nthe original, discussed whether or not it counted as a fair use,\r\nwhether Markie's use was transformative or parodic, whether it\r\nwas going to have a negative impact on the market for the\r\noriginal, weighed the issues, and ruled either way. In doing so,\r\nthere would have been some nice points to discuss about whether\r\nor not the breadth of fair use depends in part on the practice\r\nin the relevant artistic community, how to understand parodic\r\nreference, or the relevant markets for the work. (Biz Markie's\r\nlawyers had asked for permission to use the sample, but the\r\nSupreme Court has made clear that seeking permission does not\r\nweigh against a defense of fair use.) There were also some\r\ntricky issues about the breadth of legal rights over\r\nrecordings--the right was of relatively recent creation and had\r\nsome interesting limitations. Underlying it all was a more\r\nfundamental question: how do we interpret the rules of copyright\r\nso as to encourage musical creativity? After all, as this\r\nchapter has shown, borrowing and reference are a fundamental\r\npart of musical practice. We ought to think twice before\r\nconcluding they are illegal. Are we to criminalize jazz? Condemn\r\nCharles Ives? And if not, what is the carefully crafted line we\r\ndraw that allows some of those uses but condemns this one?\r\n90\r\n\r\nJudge Duffy, however, was uninterested in any of these\r\nsubtleties.\r\n91\r\n\r\n    \"Thou shalt not steal\" has been an admonition followed since\r\nthe dawn of civilization. Unfortunately, in the modern world of\r\nbusiness this admonition is not always followed. Indeed, the\r\ndefendants in this action for copyright infringement would have\r\nthis court believe that stealing is rampant in the music\r\nbusiness and, for that reason, their conduct here should be\r\nexcused. The conduct of the defendants herein, however, violates\r\nnot only the Seventh Commandment, but also the copyright laws of\r\nthis country.20\r\n92\r\n\r\nIf this were a law school exam, it would get a \"D.\" (Maybe a C\r\ngiven grade inflation.) Duffy makes all of the errors Jefferson\r\nwarned us against. Tangible property is the same as intellectual\r\nproperty. Songs are the same as sheep and the same rules can\r\napply to both. Theft is theft. The prior injunctions of the\r\nframers and the courts notwithstanding, we do not need to think\r\ncarefully about the precise boundaries of intellectual property\r\nrights or worry that interpreting them too broadly is as bad as\r\nmaking them too narrow. So far as Judge Duffy is concerned, the\r\ntablets on Mount Sinai were inscribed with an absolute\r\ninjunction against digital sampling. (The font must have been\r\nsmall.) But to say all this is merely to scratch the surface of\r\nhow regrettable a decision it is. In the narrowest and most\r\nformalistic legal terms it is also very poor.\r\n93\r\n\r\nJudge Duffy gives not a single citation to the provisions of the\r\nCopyright Act. He ignores issues of de minimis copying,\r\nsubstantial similarity, fair use, and the differences between\r\nthe right over the recording and that over the composition. In\r\nfact, he quotes the Bible more, and more accurately, than he\r\ndoes Title 17 of the U.S. Code--the Copyright Act. The one\r\nmention he makes of actual copyright law is at the end of the\r\nopinion, when he refers the case for criminal prosecution! When\r\nI first read this case, I seriously wondered for a moment if it\r\nwere a crude parody of a legal opinion written by someone who\r\nhad never been to law school.\r\n94\r\n\r\nIs the result in this case wrong? Personally, I do not think so.\r\nIt is possible, even probable, that a conscientious judge who\r\nbothered to read the law could go through a careful analysis and\r\nfind that Markie's use went beyond de minimis copying, that it\r\nwas neither creative, parodic, nor short enough to count as a\r\nfair use. The judge might have presumed a negative effect on the\r\nmarket for Mr. O'Sullivan's song and thus could have ruled that\r\nit was a copyright infringement. In doing so, the judge would\r\nhave to give some guidance to future courts about digital\r\nsampling. The most likely guidance would be \"the sample here is\r\nso extensive and so unchanged, that this case says little about\r\nthe wider musical practice of sampling.\" Judge Duffy's opinion\r\nwas poor not because of the result he reached, but because he\r\nreached it in an overly broad and judicially inappropriate way\r\nthat became a guideline for future cultural creation. Worse\r\nstill, the industry listened to him.\r\n95\r\n\r\nIn excellent books on this issue, Kembrew McLeod and Siva\r\nVaidhyanathan each argue that Grand Upright was a disaster for\r\nrap music.21 The industry's practice turned full circle almost\r\novernight. Now every sample, no matter how tiny, had to be\r\n\"cleared\"--licensed from the owners of the recording. As they\r\ntell the story, this \"legal\" change caused an aesthetic change.\r\nThe number of samples in an average song dropped precipitously.\r\nThe engaging complexity of the Public Enemy \"wall of sound\" gave\r\nway to the simplistic thumping beat and unimaginative\r\nsynthesizer lines of modern rap. I must admit to sharing\r\nMcLeod's and Vaidhyanathan's musical prejudices. The causal\r\nclaim is harder to substantiate, but industry lawyers and\r\nmusicians both agree that changes in the industry's\r\nunderstanding of the law had a major role in transforming the\r\npractice of sampling.\r\n96\r\n\r\nIf we disregard the Jefferson Warning and assume the recording\r\nartist has absolute property rights over his work, then we could\r\nignore the idea that forcing people to pay for stuff they take\r\nmight have a negative effect on future art and culture. Theft is\r\ntheft. I might be able to make art much more easily if I did not\r\nhave to pay for the paint and canvas, but that is not commonly\r\nheld to excuse shoplifting from art stores. But if we take the\r\nJefferson Warning seriously, then intellectual property's job is\r\nto balance the need to provide incentives for production and\r\ndistribution with the need to leave future creators free to\r\nbuild upon the past. Reasonable minds will differ on where this\r\nline is to be drawn, but the process of drawing it is very\r\ndifferent from the process Judge Duffy had in mind.\r\n97\r\n\r\nFor fifteen years, critics of the decision waited for an appeals\r\ncourt to fix the law in this area. When the case of Bridgeport\r\nMusic, Inc. v. Dimension Films came up, they thought they had\r\nwhat they wanted. The band NWA had used a tiny fragment (less\r\nthan two seconds) consisting of three notes of a guitar solo\r\nfrom the George Clinton song \"Get Off Your Ass and Jam.\" The\r\nfragment was an arpeggiated chord, which simply means that you\r\nstrike the notes of the chord individually and in sequence. It\r\nwas, in fact, a pretty standard \"deedly\" sound, familiar from\r\nmany guitar solos. NWA then heavily distorted this fragment and\r\nlooped it so that it played in the background of one part of the\r\nsong--so faintly that it is almost impossible to hear and\r\ncompletely impossible to recognize. (With the distortion it\r\nsounds like a very faint and distant police siren.) A company\r\ncalled Bridgeport Music owned the sound recording copyright over\r\nthe Clinton song. They sued. NWA's response was predictable--this\r\nwas classic de minimis copying, which the law did not touch. One\r\ndid not even have to get to the issue of fair use (though this\r\nsurely would be one).\r\n98\r\n\r\nThe appeals court did not waste any time attempting to dignify\r\nJudge Duffy's decision in Grand Upright.\r\n99\r\n\r\n    Although Grand Upright applied a bright-line test in a\r\nsampling case, we have not cited it as precedent for several\r\nreasons. First, it is a district court opinion and as such has\r\nno binding precedential value. Second, although it appears to\r\nhave involved claims for both sound recording and musical\r\ncomposition copyright infringement, the trial judge does not\r\ndistinguish which he is talking about in his ruling, and appears\r\nto be addressing primarily the musical composition copyright.\r\nThird, and perhaps most important, there is no analysis set\r\nforth to indicate how the judge arrived at his ruling, which has\r\nresulted in the case being criticized by commentators.22\r\n100\r\n\r\nThey did like one thing about the decision, however: its bright-\r\nline rule, \"Thou Shalt Not Steal.\" (Lawyers use the term\r\n\"bright-line rule\" to refer to a rule that is very easy to apply\r\nto the facts. A 55 mph speed limit is a bright-line rule.) The\r\nBridgeport court rejected the idea that sound recording\r\ncopyrights and music composition copyrights should be analyzed\r\nin the same way. They wanted to set a clear rule defining how\r\nmuch of a sound recording one could use without permission. How\r\nmuch? Nothing. To be precise, the court suggests in a footnote\r\nthat taking a single note might be acceptable since the\r\ncopyright protection only covers a \"series.\" Anything more,\r\nhowever, is clearly off limits.\r\n101\r\n\r\nThough they come to a conclusion that, if anything, is more\r\nstringent than Judge Duffy's, they do so very differently. In\r\ntheir words, \"Get a license or do not sample.\" Effectively, the\r\ncourt concludes that the sound recording copyright is different\r\nenough from the composition copyright that a court could\r\nreasonably conclude that a different analysis is required. The\r\njudges are fully aware that copyright must balance encouraging\r\ncurrent creators and leaving raw material to future creators--the\r\nJefferson Warning holds no novelty for them. But they conclude\r\nthat a clear \"one-note rule\" will do, because if the costs of\r\nlicenses are too high, samplers can simply recreate the riff\r\nthemselves, and this will tend to keep prices reasonable.\r\n102\r\n\r\nThis is an interesting idea. Why does this not happen more\r\noften? Why do samplers not simply recreate James Brown's\r\ndrumbeat from \"Funky Drummer,\" or George Clinton's solo from\r\n\"Get Off Your Ass and Jam\"? Musicians offer lots of different\r\nanswers. They do not understand the distinction the court is\r\ndrawing, so the market never develops. The samples themselves\r\ncannot be replicated, because the music has all kinds of\r\novertones from the historical equipment used and even the\r\nmethods of recording. Fundamentally, though, the answer seems to\r\nbe one of authenticity, ironically enough. The original beats\r\nhave a totemic significance--like the great standard chord\r\nsequences in jazz. One cannot substitute replicas for James\r\nBrown's funkiness. It just would not be the same. As Walter\r\nBenjamin pointed out long ago in \"The Work of Art in the Age of\r\nMechanical Reproduction,\" cheap copying actually increases the\r\ndemand for authenticity.23 The court's economic analysis--which\r\nimagines a world of fungible beats produced for music as a\r\nconsumer good--deals poorly with such motivations.\r\n103\r\n\r\nWhen the court first released its decision, it was greeted with\r\nconcern even by recording industry representatives who might\r\nhave been expected to favor it, because it appeared to do away\r\nwith not only the de minimis limitation on copyright (some\r\nportions are just too small to count as \"copying\") but the fair\r\nuse provisions as well. The court took the very unusual step of\r\nrehearing the case and amending the opinion, changing it in a\r\nnumber of places and adding a paragraph that stated that when\r\nthe case went back to the district court, the judge there was\r\nfree to consider the fair use defense. Of course, if one takes\r\nthis seriously--and, for the constitutional reasons given in\r\nChapter 5, I agree that the court has no power to write fair use\r\nout of the statute--it undermines the supposedly clear rule. If\r\nthe factors of fair use are seriously applied, how can a three-\r\nnote excerpt ever fail to be fair use? And if we always have to\r\ndo a conventional fair use analysis, then the apparent clarity\r\nof the one-note rule is an illusion.\r\n104\r\n\r\nThe Bridgeport decision is a bad one, I believe. Among other\r\nthings, it fails to take seriously the constitutional\r\nlimitations on copyright--including the originality requirement\r\nand the First Amendment. (A three-note sample is not original\r\nenough to be protected under copyright law, in my view. There\r\nare also more speech-related issues in sampling than the court\r\nseems to realize.) The competitive licensing market the court\r\nimagines seems more like economic fantasy than reality. I think\r\nthe ruling sets unnecessary barriers on musical creation and\r\nends up with a rule that is just as blurry as the one it\r\ncriticizes. I think the court's reading of the statute and\r\nlegislative history is wrong--though I have not bored you with\r\nthe full details of that argument. But I want to be clear that\r\nit is a very different kind of bad decision from Judge Duffy's.\r\n105\r\n\r\nThe court in Bridgeport does see copyright as a balance. It does\r\nunderstand the need for future creators to build on the past,\r\nbut it also shows that a simple willingness to look upon\r\nintellectual property protections in a utilitarian way does not\r\nsolve all problems. It certainly does not proceed from\r\nJefferson's presumption that intellectual property protections\r\nshould be interpreted narrowly. Though it claims to have a\r\n\"literal\" reading of the statute, the real driving force in the\r\nanalysis is an unconsummated desire for bright-line rules and a\r\nbelief that the market will solve these problems by itself. The\r\ncourt also suggests that \"[i]f this is not what Congress\r\nintended or is not what they would intend now, it is easy enough\r\nfor the record industry, as they have done in the past, to go\r\nback to Congress for a clarification or change in the law.\" Note\r\nthe assumption that \"the record industry\" is the most reliable\r\nguide to Congress's intentions or that it is the only entity\r\naffected by such a rule. This is truly the image of copyright\r\nlaw as a contract among affected industries. Of course, digital\r\nartists such as The Legendary K.O. hardly fit within such a\r\nmodel.\r\n106\r\n\r\nUnder the rule in Bridgeport--\"Get a license or do not\r\nsample\"--Mr. Randle and Mr. Nickerson appear to be breaking the\r\nlaw. They did not get a license and they most definitely did\r\nsample. What about fair use?\r\n107\r\n\r\nUnder fair use, copyright allows a very specific (and possibly\r\nlengthy) use of another's material when the purpose is parody of\r\nthat prior work itself. The Supreme Court gave parody a unique\r\nstatus in the Acuff-Rose case. The (extremely profane) rap group\r\n2 Live Crew had asked for permission to produce a version of Roy\r\nOrbison's \"Pretty Woman.\" But where Orbison sang about the\r\npretty woman walking down the street whom he would like to meet,\r\n2 Live Crew wrote about a \"big hairy woman\" (\"with hair that\r\nain't legit, 'cause you look like Cousin It\"). They sang about a\r\n\"bald headed\" woman with a \"teeny weeny afro.\" They sang about\r\ngroup sex with both women. Finally, they told a \"two timin'\r\nwoman,\" \"now I know the baby ain't mine.\" Justice Souter showed\r\nthe characteristic sangfroid of a Supreme Court justice faced\r\nwith raunchy rap music.\r\n108\r\n\r\n    While we might not assign a high rank to the parodic element\r\nhere, we think it fair to say that 2 Live Crew's song reasonably\r\ncould be perceived as commenting on the original or criticizing\r\nit, to some degree. 2 Live Crew juxtaposes the romantic musings\r\nof a man whose fantasy comes true, with degrading taunts, a\r\nbawdy demand for sex, and a sigh of relief from paternal\r\nresponsibility. The later words can be taken as a comment on the\r\nnaiveté of the original of an earlier day, as a rejection of its\r\nsentiment that ignores the ugliness of street life and the\r\ndebasement that it signifies. It is this joinder of reference\r\nand ridicule that marks off the author's choice of parody from\r\nthe other types of comment and criticism that traditionally have\r\nhad a claim to fair use protection as transformative works.24\r\n[emphasis added]\r\n109\r\n\r\nTruly, the law can confront and master all cultural forms. The\r\nheart of parody as the Supreme Court described it is that one is\r\ntaking aim at the original. Because 2 Live Crew could be seen as\r\ndirecting their song at Orbison's original, rather than using\r\nOrbison's song to make some other political or social point, the\r\ncourt was willing to give it the favorable consideration that\r\nparody receives as a fair use.\r\n110\r\n\r\nDoes \"George Bush Doesn't Care About Black People\" fit that\r\nmodel? The Legendary K.O. were not \"taking aim\" at \"Gold\r\nDigger.\" True, they quoted West's actual words from the\r\ntelevision broadcast (also copyrighted). They even used them as\r\ntheir title. But they were not taking aim at his song.\r\n(Ironically, Kanye West has a better claim that he was taking\r\naim at Ray Charles's picture of womanhood, in just the way\r\ndescribed in the 2 Live Crew case.) Rather, The Legendary K.O.\r\nwere using the sample of the song as the backing to an entirely\r\ndifferent rap that expressed, in familiar and popular musical\r\nform, a more expansive version of his condemnation of both press\r\nand president. That does not end the inquiry. Parody is not the\r\nonly form of protected criticism or commentary. But it makes it\r\nmuch harder for them to succeed, particularly in light of the\r\nhostility toward sampling betrayed by both Grand Upright and\r\nBridgeport.\r\n111\r\n\r\nThe videos made by The Black Lantern and Franklin Lopez present\r\nan even more complex set of questions. On top of the music\r\ncopyright issues, we also have fair use claims for the extensive\r\nnews footage and footage of Mr. Foxx. The Black Lantern also\r\nused some fragments of a popular video by Jib-Jab, which had a\r\ncartoon Bush and Kerry singing dueling parodied versions of\r\nWoody Guthrie's \"This Land.\" When JibJab's video first came out,\r\nthe Guthrie estate claimed copyright infringement over the song.\r\nAssisted by a number of public interest legal groups, JibJab\r\nclaimed fair use. (It eventually came out that the copyright\r\nover the song was no longer valid.) What did Jib-Jab do when The\r\nBlack Lantern sampled them in their turn? In a move that both\r\nwins the prize for hypocrisy and serves to sum up the\r\nintersection of law and culture I have been describing, they\r\nsent him a cease and desist letter. The video was taken down for\r\na week and he was eventually forced to remove the segment of\r\ntheir video from his work. Fair use for me, but not for thee.\r\n112\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n113\r\n\r\nThe Legendary K.O. samples Kanye West, who uses a fragment from\r\nRay Charles, who may have taken material from Will Lamartine\r\nThompson or, more likely, from Clara Ward (who herself borrowed\r\nfrom a gospel standard). The chain of borrowing I describe here\r\nhas one end in the hymns and spirituals of the early 1900s and\r\nthe other in the twenty-first century's chaotic stew of digital\r\nsampling, remix, and mashup. Along the way, we have the\r\nsynthesis of old and the invention of new musical genres--often\r\nagainst the wishes of those whose work is serving as the raw\r\nmaterial. One way of viewing this story is that each of these\r\nmusicians (except for some imaginary original artist, the\r\nmusical source of the Nile) is a plagiarist and a pirate. If\r\nthey are licensing their material or getting it from the public\r\ndomain, then they may not be lawbreakers but they are still\r\nunoriginal slavish imitators. If one's image of creativity is\r\nthat of the romantic, iconoclastic creator who invents the world\r\nanew with each creation, those conclusions seem entirely\r\nappropriate. The borrowing here is rampant. Far from building\r\neverything anew, these musicians seem quite deliberately to base\r\ntheir work on fragments taken from others.\r\n114\r\n\r\nIt is important to remember that copyright does not subscribe\r\ncompletely to the idea of romantic creation where music is\r\nconcerned. As I pointed out earlier, musical genres develop out\r\nof other genres: soul from gospel and rhythm and blues; gospel\r\nfrom spirituals; rhythm and blues from jazz, jump music, and\r\nDelta blues; and so on. When it comes to genres, we can play the\r\ngame of musicological \"six degrees of separation\" all day long.\r\nCopyright is supposed to leave \"holes\" in its coverage so that\r\nthe genre is not covered, only the specific form of creativity\r\nwithin the genre. I mentioned before the need to keep the lines\r\nof genre and form open, to keep them free from private property\r\nrights in order to allow musicians to develop the form by using\r\nthem as common property, the \"highways\" of musical progress. So,\r\nfor example, the twelve-bar blues uses the first, fourth, and\r\nfifth chords in a scale. That sequence cannot be owned, unless\r\nblues is to become impossible or illegal. Bebop is characterized\r\nby copious use of the flattened fifth--a sound which was jarring\r\nto audiences when it was first introduced and which marked the\r\nbreak with the more accessible jazz of swing and the big bands.\r\nThe flattened fifth is not owned. These characteristic genre-\r\ncreating sequences or sounds are supposed to be left in the\r\npublic domain, though increasingly some scholars--including\r\nme--are coming to believe that we have managed to make the\r\ncopyright holder's control so complete and so granular as to\r\nclose those common areas and impede the development of future\r\nmusical forms. The Bridgeport court might extend its logic and\r\nimagine that the entire musical commons could be licensed, of\r\ncourse. The presence of other chord sequences would keep the\r\nprice down! But up to now, we have not gone that far. In theory\r\nat least, copyright is not supposed to stop the next Ray\r\nCharles, the person who wants to fuse two older forms of music\r\nto create a third.\r\n115\r\n\r\nYet the chain of borrowing that links The Legendary K.O., Kanye\r\nWest, Ray Charles, and the Bailey Gospel Singers is of a\r\ndifferent kind. This borrowing involves taking chunks of prior\r\nmusicians' melodies, their words, their lyrical patterns. This\r\nis not just copying the genre. It is copying the lines of the\r\nsong within the genre. This is the kind of stuff copyright is\r\nsupposed to regulate even when it is working well. And yet,\r\nlistening to the sequence, it is hard to deny that at each stage\r\nsomething artistic and innovative, something remarkable, has\r\nbeen created. In fact, the story of this song is the striking\r\nability of each set of artists to impose their own sound,\r\ntemperament, spirituality, humor, vision of women, or, in the\r\ncase of The Legendary K.O., their intense and profane political\r\nanger, onto the musical phrases they have in common.\r\n116\r\n\r\nThe postmodern conclusion here is \"there is nothing new under\r\nthe sun\"--that all creation is re-creation, that there is no such\r\nthing as originality, merely endless imitation. If this is meant\r\nto be a comment about how things get created, at least in music,\r\nI think there is some truth to it. But if it is a claim about\r\naesthetic worth, a denial that there are more and less creative\r\nindividuals in the arts, I find it as facile and unconvincing as\r\nits romantic authorial opposite.\r\n117\r\n\r\nWhat is fascinating about the artists I describe here is that,\r\nwhile they do not fit neatly into either the aesthetic ideal of\r\nindependent creation or the legal model for how creative\r\nexpression gets made, they each have a remarkable, palpable\r\ncreativity. Each leaves us with something new, even if formed\r\npartly from the fragments of the past. One could describe Ray\r\nCharles as the merest plagiarist--making \"search and replace\"\r\nsongs by substituting a woman for the deity in already-\r\nestablished hits. But if that is our conclusion, it merely\r\nproves that our theories of aesthetics are poorer than the\r\ncreativity they seek to describe. So much the worse for the\r\ntheories.\r\n118\r\n\r\nAs Jefferson pointed out, the lines surrounding intellectual\r\nproperty are hard to draw--something the Bridgeport court got\r\nright. When we draw them, whether legally or as a matter of\r\naesthetic morality, we do so partly with standard instances in\r\nmind. \"Well, that can't be wrong,\" we think to ourselves, and\r\nreason by analogy accordingly. Yet the process of analogy fails\r\nus sometimes, because the types of borrowing change over time.\r\n119\r\n\r\nRay Charles was frank about the way he copied the style and\r\nlicks of Nat King Cole like an apprentice learning from a\r\nlawyer. But he and his estate assiduously guarded his copyrights\r\nagainst more modern borrowing they found to be inappropriate.\r\nJudge Duffy thunderously denounces Biz Markie. It is harder to\r\nimagine him leveling the same condemnation at Dizzy Gillespie,\r\nCharles Ives, Oscar Peterson, or, for that matter, Beethoven,\r\nthough all of them made copious use of the works of others in\r\ntheir own. It is bizarre to imagine a Bridgeport-like rule being\r\nextended to composition copyrights and applied to music such as\r\njazz. \"Get a license or do not solo\"? I think not. Does it make\r\nany more sense for sampling?\r\n120\r\n\r\nIf there is a single reason I told the story of these songs it\r\nis this: to most of us, certainly to me, the idea that copyright\r\nencourages creativity and discourages the reuse of material\r\ncreated by others seems reasonable. Of course, I would want to\r\napply the correctives implied by the Jefferson Warning--to make\r\nsure the rights were as short and as narrow as possible. But at\r\nleast when it comes to copying chunks of expression still\r\ncovered by copyright, our intuitions are to encourage people to\r\ncreate \"their own work,\" rather than to rely on remix. What does\r\nthat mean in the world of music? As the story I have told here\r\nseems to illustrate, even musicians of unquestioned\r\n\"originality,\" even those who can make a claim to having created\r\na new musical genre, sometimes did so by a process rather more\r\nlike collage than creation out of nothing, taking chunks of\r\nexisting work that were proven to work well and setting them in\r\na new context or frame.\r\n121\r\n\r\nImagine Ray Charles trying to create \"I Got a Woman\" today. Both\r\nof his possible sources would be strongly and automatically\r\nprotected by copyright. The industries in which those works were\r\nproduced would be much more legalistic and infinitely more\r\nlitigious. The owners of those copyrights could use them to stop\r\nhim from \"desecrating their work\"--which is literally what he is\r\ndoing. We know Clara Ward objected to Charles's other borrowings\r\nfrom gospel. I cannot imagine Will Lamartine Thompson or his\r\nworthy neighbors in East Liverpool looking kindly on the sweet\r\n\"early morning loving\" outside of wedlock described in \"I Got a\r\nWoman,\" still less the use of sacred music to glorify it. And\r\ncopyright gives them the power to say no. Remember Macaulay's\r\ndescription of how Richardson's novels might have been censored\r\nby a moralistic heir? Even if the objections were not vetoes,\r\nbut simple demands for payment, would we get \"I Got a Woman\" and\r\n\"This Little Girl of Mine\"? Given the extent of the borrowing\r\nthat jump-started this particular genre-bridging effort, would\r\nwe be likely to see the birth of soul music?\r\n122\r\n\r\nCongress assures us that the many increases in copyright\r\nprotection have been in the name of encouraging creativity. The\r\nmusic industry says the same thing when its pettifogging\r\nclearance procedures and permission culture are criticized. But\r\ndo we really think we are more likely to get a twenty-first-\r\ncentury Ray Charles, or a fusion of styles to create a new\r\ngenre, in the world we have made? Do we really think that the\r\nformalist ignorance of Judge Duffy or the market optimism of the\r\nBridgeport court, in which thick markets offer fungible sets of\r\nsamples to be traded like commodities, are good guides for the\r\nfuture of music? Are we in fact killing musical creativity with\r\nthe rules that are supposed to defend it?\r\n123\r\n\r\nAn Internet optimist would tell us that is precisely the point.\r\nTrue, because of the errors described in the chapter on the\r\nJefferson Warning, and the mistakes catalogued in the chapters\r\non the Internet Threat and the Farmers' Tale, we have\r\ndramatically expanded the scope, length, and power of the rights\r\nthat are supposed to shape our creative culture. But technology\r\ncures all. Look at The Legendary K.O., The Black Lantern, or\r\nFranklin Lopez. They are all probably breaking the law as it is\r\ncurrently interpreted by the courts. But their work can be\r\ncreated for pennies and distributed to millions. The technology\r\nallows people to circumvent the law. Admittedly, some of the\r\ncopyright holders will police their rights assiduously--think of\r\nJibJab's newfound dislike of fair use and their power to alter\r\nThe Black Lantern's video. But others either cannot or will not.\r\nKanye West's representatives in particular are unlikely to be\r\nstupid enough to sue The Legendary K.O. in the first place.\r\nInternet distribution becomes a demimonde in which the rules of\r\nthe rest of the society either cannot or will not be enforced.\r\nArt gets its breathing room, not from legal exceptions, but from\r\ntechnological enforcement difficulties. Finally, as more and\r\nmore people can create and distribute digital culture, they are\r\nless likely to understand, believe in, or accept rules that are\r\nstrongly at variance with their aesthetic and moral assumptions.\r\n124\r\n\r\nThere is a lot to these points. The technology does transform\r\nthe conditions of creativity, and sometimes it runs right over\r\nthe law in the process. Thousands, even millions, can be reached\r\noutside of conventional distribution channels with work that is\r\ntechnically illegal. And attitudes toward creative propriety do\r\nnot track legal rules. When I wrote to Mr. Randle and Mr.\r\nNickerson, I found that they realized Mr. West probably had a\r\nlegal right to get their work taken down, but they felt he would\r\nnot use it, and they had a very commonsensical conception of\r\nwhat they ought to be allowed to do. They were not making any\r\nmoney from this. They were making a political point, drawing\r\nattention to a political and human problem. That made it okay.\r\nThey would have liked more formal permission so that they could\r\nactually distribute CDs through conventional for-profit\r\nchannels, perhaps with some portion of the proceeds going to\r\ndisaster relief, but they understood they were unlikely to get\r\nit.\r\n125\r\n\r\nDespite all this, I am uncomfortable with the argument \"do not\r\nworry, technology will allow us to evade the rules where they\r\nare stupid.\" A system that can only function well through\r\nrepeated lawbreaking is an unstable and dangerous one. It breeds\r\na lack of respect for the law in those who should be its\r\ngreatest supporters and beneficiaries. It blurs civil\r\ndisobedience and plain old lawbreaking. Sitting in on the\r\nsegregated lunch counter and being willing to face the\r\nconsequences is very different from parking in the disabled\r\nspace and hoping you can get away with it. It also blurs our\r\njudgment of conduct. Whatever one thinks of them, The Legendary\r\nK.O. are doing something very different than a college student\r\nwho just does not want to pay for music and downloads thousands\r\nof tracks for free from file sharing networks.\r\n126\r\n\r\nThe problem is not simply one of blurring. Technology-based\r\n\"freedoms\" are not reliable (though legal ones, too, may fail).\r\nIn a pinch, the technology may not save you, as thousands of\r\nthose same downloaders have found out when sued by the RIAA and\r\nforced to pay thousands of dollars for an activity they thought\r\nto be private and anonymous. The Internet \"solution\" also leaves\r\ncertain types of artistic creation dependent on the vagaries of\r\nthe current technology, which may well change, eliminating some\r\nof the zone of freedom we currently rely on. But more worrisome\r\nis the fact that this \"solution\" actually confines certain types\r\nof art to the world of the Internet.\r\n127\r\n\r\nThe video of \"George Bush Doesn't Care About Black People\" could\r\nbe seen by many, but only if they were wired to the right\r\ntechnological and social network. (After all, someone has to\r\ntell you to watch.) It was a searing intervention in the\r\nnational debate on Katrina. But it appeared on no television\r\nstation. Like most of the mashups created online, the fact that\r\nthe rights could never be cleared keeps it off mass media.\r\nCopyright acts as the barbed wire around mass media outlets.\r\nThat is a shame, I think. Not because that video is so good--you\r\nmay love it or hate it. But because this kind of artwork has\r\nsomething important to contribute to our national culture.\r\nImagine a world in which Ray Charles could create \"I Got a\r\nWoman,\" but could only circulate it to a narrow group of the\r\nfile-trading digerati because of a flagrant violation of Clara\r\nWard's copyright. Do we still get soul? The blues? Jazz? Or do\r\nwe just get a precious and insular digital subculture, whose\r\ncultural experiments never reach the mainstream?\r\n128\r\n\r\nThroughout his life, Charles described an intimate relationship\r\nwith his audience, with the public. He described their tastes as\r\na check, as a corrective; he thought they would actually be\r\n\"ahead\" of the artists. He wanted to make songs that would be\r\nlistened to by tens of millions of people. And he wanted to make\r\nart and lots of money. I am all for the person who wants to\r\ncreate as an \"amateur-professional\" and distribute outside the\r\nchains of commerce. I have worked with organizations that make\r\nit easier to do this. But I also believe in the power and\r\ncreativity of commercial culture and political speech carried on\r\nmass media. Ironically, our current copyright system serves it\r\npoorly.\r\n129\r\n\r\nWhat is the solution to all of this? The music business runs on\r\ncompulsory licenses, a legally granted ability to use music in\r\ncertain ways without permission, though with a fee. The system\r\nseems to function pretty well. One solution is to extend that\r\nsystem to the world of mashups and derivative works. If you\r\nmerely copy the whole of my work and circulate it on file\r\nsharing networks or on CDs, we apply the current rules and\r\npenalties. If, on the other hand, you make a \"derivative\" work,\r\nmixing your work with mine, then there are two alternatives. If\r\nyou stay in the world of nonprofit exchange, you get a\r\nheightened presumption in favor of fair use (perhaps\r\nadministered through a quicker and cheaper system of\r\narbitration). If you move into the for-profit world, then you\r\nmust pay a flat licensing fee or percentage of profits to the\r\ncopyright holder.\r\n130\r\n\r\nA second solution would be to curtail the hypertrophy of\r\nprotectionism that made all this happen in the first place. The\r\ncopyright term could be shortened or we could require renewal\r\nevery twenty-eight years. (There are international treaties that\r\ncurrently forbid the latter alternative.) We could cut back on\r\nexcesses like the Bridgeport decision, create incentives to make\r\nthe music industry less legalistically insistent on policing the\r\nmost atomic level of creation. We could exempt samples shorter\r\nthan five seconds from copyright liability, clarify the\r\nboundaries of fair use, and extend it beyond parody to other\r\ngenre-smashing forms such as satire and collage.\r\n131\r\n\r\nThere are enormous obstacles to all these proposals. In\r\nparticular, while artists fare very poorly under the current\r\nclearance culture--paying but not receiving the benefits of\r\npayments--the middlemen who profit from transaction costs are not\r\nkeen on abolishing them. Certainly if, as the Bridgeport court\r\nassumed, the recording industry is the party responsible for\r\nfine-tuning copyright law, we are hardly likely to see any\r\nreforms that threaten current modes of doing business. Yet there\r\nis a ray of hope. It is getting harder and harder to pretend\r\nthat the rules ostensibly designed to encourage creativity are\r\nactually working. At the same time, more and more people are\r\ncreating and distributing cultural objects--becoming \"subjects\"\r\nof intellectual property law in the process, often to their\r\ndismay and irritation. It is in that conjunction--a far cry from\r\nthe industry contract envisioned by the Bridgeport court--that\r\nhope for the future of copyright law's treatment of culture\r\nmight lie.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 7: The Enclosure of Science and Technology: Two Case\r\nStudies\r\n1\r\n\r\nOver the last forty years, much has changed in the way that\r\nscientific research and technological development are organized,\r\nfunded, and institutionally arranged. Much has also changed in\r\nthe type of scientific and technical material that is covered by\r\nintellectual property rights, the ways that material is covered,\r\nthe parties who hold the rights, and the state of research and\r\ndevelopment at which rights claims are made. Many academics who\r\nstudy both science's organizational structure and the\r\nintellectual property claims that surround it are concerned\r\nabout the results. To say this is not to conjure up a tragically\r\nlost world of pure research science, untainted by property\r\nclaims or profit motives. That world never existed and it is\r\nprobably a good thing too. Intellectual property rights, and the\r\nprofit motive more generally, have a vital and beneficial role\r\nin moving innovations from lab bench to bedside, from computer\r\nsimulation to actual flight. The question is not whether\r\nintellectual property rights are useful as part of scientific\r\nand technological development. The question is what type of\r\nrights they should be, where in the research process those\r\nrights are best deployed, how they should coexist with state\r\nfunded basic scientific and technological research, how broad\r\nthey should be, how they should deal with new technologies, how\r\nlong they should last, how they should treat follow-on\r\ninnovations.\r\n2\r\n\r\nI cannot hope here to answer all those questions, though some\r\nfascinating research has begun the process. Instead, as with the\r\nmusic chapter, I will offer a case study--actually two case\r\nstudies--that try to illuminate the process I am describing, to\r\nillustrate its pitfalls and its strange and unintended\r\nconsequences.\r\n3\r\n\r\nThe two defining technologies of the last thirty years are\r\nbiotechnology and the networked computer. Each is both product\r\nand platform. Innovations themselves, they are also constitutive\r\ntechnologies that enable still more innovations. But at several\r\nhistorical moments in the development of each we came perilously\r\nclose to breaking technology with law.1 Some would say that it\r\nwas not just a close shave: we actually have hampered or limited\r\nthe full potential of technology, slowing down its dynamism with\r\na host of overbroad software patents, gene patents, and\r\nmaterials transfer agreements. Others are more optimistic. They\r\nthink that a series of rapid improvisations by courts,\r\nscientists, programmers, and businesspeople has largely\r\nmitigated any problems caused by the process of legal\r\nexpansion.2 But if mistakes were made, it is important to know\r\nwhat they were lest we continue or repeat them. If there were\r\n\"fixes,\" it is important to know if they can be replicated.\r\n4\r\n\r\nSo were there mistakes? If so, have they been fixed, and how?\r\nDrawing on an article I co-wrote with my brilliant colleague\r\nArti Rai,3 this chapter suggests some answers to those questions\r\nby sketching out some details of the legal history of those\r\ntechnologies, concluding with a discussion of a single promising\r\nnew technology that shares aspects of both--synthetic biology.\r\nThe answers are important. Behind the abstract words\r\n\"innovation\" or \"technological development\" there are lives\r\nsaved or lost, communicative freedoms expanded or contracted,\r\ncommunities enabled or stunted, wealth generated or not. The\r\nsubject would benefit from informed, sophisticated, democratic\r\nattention. It is not something you want to leave a host of\r\nlawyers and lobbyists to decide among themselves.\r\n5\r\n\r\nA MACHINE THAT CONTAINS\r\nALL OTHER MACHINES\r\n6\r\n\r\nImagine a person staring at an infinite roll of paper tape. On\r\nthe paper are symbols in some alphabet or number system. The\r\nreader carries out simple, operable instructions on the basis of\r\nthat data. \"Add together the next two digits you are presented\r\nwith and write down the answer. If the answer is odd, go to step\r\n2. If the answer is even, go to step 3.\" Now replace the person\r\nwith a mechanical head that can \"read\" the instructions, carry\r\nout the desired operations, and write the answer down. The\r\nBritish mathematician Alan Turing imagined something like this--a\r\nlittle more complicated, perhaps, but fairly similar. What is\r\nit? We have the reading head, the set of instructions, the data\r\non which the instructions are to be performed, the record of the\r\nresult, and some kind of \"state table\" that tells the machine\r\nwhere it is in the process. These are the component parts of\r\nTuring machines--or as we know them better, computers. More\r\naccurately, Turing machines are a method of simulating the\r\noperation of computers, a metaphor that enables us to imitate\r\ntheir logical processes. In the words of Wikipedia, \"despite\r\ntheir simplicity--[they] can be adapted to simulate the logic of\r\nany computer that could possibly be constructed.\" And to give\r\nlawyers fits. But that is getting ahead of ourselves.\r\n7\r\n\r\nIn Greek mythology, Procrustes had a bed to which he fitted its\r\nprospective occupants, whether they liked it or not. The tall\r\nwere trimmed down. The short stretched on the rack. Intellectual\r\nproperty lawyers have many similarities to Procrustes. The\r\ntechnologies that are brought before them are made to fit the\r\nconceptual boxes the law provides, boxes with names such as\r\n\"copyright\" and \"patent.\" Occasionally, new conceptual boxes are\r\nmade, but--for very good reasons--most of the time we stick with\r\nthe boxes we have. As with Procrustes, things do not always fit\r\nand the process can be distressing for its subjects.\r\n8\r\n\r\nIt is important to realize that the process of trimming and\r\nstretching can be done well or badly. If it is done really\r\nbadly, the technology is stunted, deformed, even destroyed. If\r\nit is done well, the law aids the development of the technology\r\nin exactly the happy way described in Chapter 1. What did our\r\nProcrustean legal system do with computers and computer science?\r\n9\r\n\r\nI will focus on software--the set of instructions the machine is\r\nto perform. How should we think of it? Software is written down\r\nby programmers. It is recorded first in a form readable to\r\nhumans, or at least geeks. Then, through a series of\r\ntransformations, it is turned into the machine code, the ones\r\nand zeros that will operate the computer. But at its root it can\r\nbe understood through the metaphor of the simple list of\r\ninstructions to be carried out in order, just as with the Turing\r\nmachine and its infinite tape.\r\n10\r\n\r\nHow should we fit software into the categories of intellectual\r\nproperty? We have \"writing,\" fixation in some medium of symbols\r\nthat can be read by others--both machine and human. Writing is\r\nnormally the domain of copyright. Are computer programs\r\ncopyrightable? All kinds of problems present themselves. At\r\nleast in the United States, copyright covers expression. As I\r\npointed out in a previous book, at its base is the conception of\r\nthe romantic author impressing her uniqueness of spirit on the\r\nwork at the moment of writing. It is that expressive choice, not\r\nthe facts or ideas on which the work is based, that copyright\r\ncovers. And it is only original expression that copyright\r\ncovers. It does not cover purely functional objects, systems,\r\nprocesses, or methods of operation. One cannot copyright the\r\ncoat hanger, the mousetrap, or long division. One cannot even\r\ncopyright a \"sculpture\" if the main function of its design is to\r\nserve as a bicycle rack. Admittedly, one can copyright some\r\nexpressive works that serve a practical purpose. A book about\r\nhow to do double-entry bookkeeping is copyrightable. Yet\r\ncopyright covers only the expressive choices used in selecting\r\nthe words to explain the method, and the images to represent it,\r\nnot the methods it describes or the facts or ideas it contains.\r\nCan copyright cover computer programs? Should we see them as\r\ncopyrightable how-to books or as uncopyrightable machines made\r\nof words?\r\n11\r\n\r\nMachines and other functional innovations are normally the\r\ndomain of patent rights. One can patent the mousetrap, and then\r\none gets an exclusive right to the actual mechanically enabled\r\nmethod of catching mice, not just the artistic flourishes on the\r\nblueprint. Patents have more demanding criteria than copyrights.\r\nThe invention needs to be novel and have utility, or usefulness;\r\nI cannot get a patent over something that would have been an\r\nobvious idea to an insider in the relevant field of technology,\r\na \"person having ordinary skill in the art,\" or PHOSITA, in the\r\njargon of patent lawyers. But once I get my patent, it gives me\r\na very strong power to exclude others from the invention--even if\r\nthey came up with it independently. The right lasts for twenty\r\nyears. Follow-on innovators who improve on my idea can get a\r\npatent on that improvement. They can block me from using the\r\nimprovement. I can block them from using the original invention.\r\nThus we have an incentive to negotiate if either of us wants to\r\nbring the improved innovation to market.\r\n12\r\n\r\nSo where did software fit? Was it copyrightable writing or\r\npatentable invention? There are two issues here. The first is\r\nwhether there should be any intellectual property rights over\r\nsoftware at all. The basic case for that proposition is simple,\r\na classic example of the public goods problem described in the\r\nfirst chapter. Software costs money to create, but is cheap to\r\ncopy. When a youthful Bill Gates wrote his 1976 letter to the\r\nwonderfully named Dr. Dobb's Journal of Computer Calisthenics &\r\nOrthodontia, he put the point clearly.\r\n13\r\n\r\n    Who can afford to do professional work for nothing? What\r\nhobbyist can put 3-man years into programming, finding all the\r\nbugs, documenting his product and distribute it for free? The\r\nfact is, no one besides us has invested a lot of money into\r\nhobby software. We have written 6800 BASIC, and are writing 8080\r\nAPL and 6800 APL, but there is very little incentive to make\r\nthis software available to hobbyists. Most directly, the thing\r\nyou do is theft.4\r\n14\r\n\r\nHe signed the letter \"Bill Gates, General Partner, Micro-Soft.\"\r\nThe hyphen would disappear in time. The philosophy stuck around.\r\n15\r\n\r\nThough there are quibbles about the facts in Gates's\r\nletter--critics claim he himself did a lot of free riding on\r\npublic domain code and government-funded computer time--his basic\r\npoint is that software needs to be protected by (enforceable)\r\nproperty rights if we expect it to be effectively and\r\nsustainably produced. Some software developers disagree. But\r\nassuming one concedes the point for the sake of argument, there\r\nis a second question: should software be covered by copyright or\r\npatent, or some unidentified third option?\r\n16\r\n\r\nIn practice, software ended up being covered by both schemes,\r\npartly because of actions by Congress, which included several\r\nreferences to software in the Copyright Act, and partly as a\r\nresult of decisions by the Copyright Office, the Patent and\r\nTrademark Office, and judges. One could copyright one's code and\r\nalso gain a patent over the \"nonobvious,\" novel, and useful\r\ninnovations inside the software.\r\n17\r\n\r\nAt first, it was the use of copyright that stirred the most\r\nconcern. As I explained in the last chapter, copyright seems to\r\nbe built around an assumption of diverging innovation--the\r\nfountain or explosion of expressive activity. Different people\r\nin different situations who sit down to write a sonnet or a love\r\nstory, it is presumed, will produce very different creations\r\nrather than being drawn to a single result. Thus strong rights\r\nover the resulting work are not supposed to inhibit future\r\nprogress. I can find my own muse, my own path to immortality.\r\nCreative expression is presumed to be largely independent of the\r\nwork of prior authors. Raw material is not needed. \"Copyright is\r\nabout sustaining the conditions of creativity that enable an\r\nindividual to craft out of thin air an Appalachian Spring, a Sun\r\nAlso Rises, a Citizen Kane.\"5\r\n18\r\n\r\nThere are lots of reasons to doubt that this vision of \"creation\r\nout of nothing\" works very well even in the arts, the\r\ntraditional domain of copyright law. The story of Ray Charles's\r\n\"I Got a Woman\" bears ample witness to those doubts. But\r\nwhatever its merits or defects in the realm of the arts, the\r\nvision seems completely wrongheaded when it comes to software.\r\nSoftware solutions to practical problems do converge, and\r\nprogrammers definitely draw upon prior lines of code. Worse\r\nstill, as I pointed out earlier, software tends to exhibit\r\n\"network effects.\" Unlike my choice of novel, my choice of word\r\nprocessing program is very strongly influenced, perhaps\r\ndominated, by the question of what program other people have\r\nchosen to buy. That means that even if a programmer could find a\r\ncompletely different way to write a word processing program, he\r\nhas to be able to make it read the dominant program's files, and\r\nmimic its features, if he is to attract any customers at all.\r\nThat hardly sounds like completely divergent creation.\r\n19\r\n\r\nSeeing that software failed to fit the Procrustean bed of\r\ncopyright, many scholars presumed the process of forcing it into\r\nplace would be catastrophic. They believed that, lacking\r\npatent's high standards, copyright's monopolies would\r\nproliferate widely. Copyright's treatment of follow-on or\r\n\"derivative\" works would impede innovation, it was thought. The\r\nforce of network effects would allow the copyright holder of\r\nwhatever software became \"the standard\" to extract huge monopoly\r\nrents and prevent competing innovation for many years longer\r\nthan the patent term. Users of programs would be locked in,\r\nunable to shift their documents, data, or acquired skills to a\r\ncompeting program. Doom and gloom abounded among copyright\r\nscholars, including many who shared Mr. Gates's basic\r\npremise--that software should be covered by property rights. They\r\nsimply believed that these were the wrong property rights to\r\nuse.\r\n20\r\n\r\nCopyright did indeed cause problems for software developers,\r\nthough it is hard to judge whether those problems outweighed the\r\neconomic benefits of encouraging software innovation,\r\nproduction, and distribution. But the negative effects of\r\ncopyright were minimized by a remarkably prescient set of\r\nactions by courts and, to a much lesser extent, Congress, so\r\nthat the worst scenarios did not come to pass. Courts\r\ninterpreted the copyright over software very narrowly, so that\r\nit covered little beyond literal infringement. (Remember\r\nJefferson's point about the importance of being careful about\r\nthe scope of a right.) They developed a complicated test to work\r\nout whether one program infringed the details of another. The\r\ndetails give law students headaches every year, but the effects\r\nwere simple. If your software was similar to mine merely because\r\nit was performing the same function, or because I had picked the\r\nmost efficient way to perform some task, or even because there\r\nwas market demand for doing it that way, then none of those\r\nsimilarities counted for the purposes of infringement. Nor did\r\nmaterial that was taken from the public domain. The result was\r\nthat while someone who made literal copies of Windows Vista was\r\nclearly infringing copyright, the person who made a competing\r\nprogram generally would not be.\r\n21\r\n\r\nIn addition, courts interpreted the fair use doctrine to cover\r\n\"decompilation\"--which is basically taking apart someone else's\r\nprogram so that you can understand it and compete with it. As\r\npart of the process, the decompiler had to make a copy of the\r\nprogram. If the law were read literally, decompilation would\r\nhardly seem to be a fair use. The decompiler makes a whole copy,\r\nfor a commercial purpose, of a copyrighted work, precisely in\r\norder to cause harm to its market by offering a substitute good.\r\nBut the courts took a broader view. The copy was a necessary\r\npart of the process of producing a competing product, rather\r\nthan a piratical attempt to sell a copy of the same product.\r\nThis limitation on copyright provided by fair use was needed in\r\norder to foster the innovation that copyright is supposed to\r\nencourage. This is a nice variation of the Sony Axiom from\r\nChapter 4.\r\n22\r\n\r\nThese rulings and others like them meant that software was\r\nprotected by copyright, as Mr. Gates wanted, but that the\r\ncopyright did not give its owner the right to prevent functional\r\nimitation and competition. Is that enough? Clearly the network\r\neffects are real. Most of us use Windows and most of us use\r\nMicrosoft Word, and one very big reason is because everyone else\r\ndoes. Optimists believe the lure of capturing this huge market\r\nwill keep potential competitors hungry and monopolists scared.\r\nThe lumbering dominant players will not become complacent about\r\ninnovation or try to grab every morsel of monopoly rent, goes\r\nthe argument. They still have to fear their raptor-like\r\ncompetitors lurking in the shadows. Perhaps. Or perhaps it also\r\ntakes the consistent threat of antitrust enforcement. In any\r\nevent, whether or not we hit the optimal point in protecting\r\nsoftware with intellectual property rights, those rights\r\ncertainly did not destroy the industry. It appeared that, even\r\nwith convergent creativity and network effects, software could\r\nbe crammed into the Procrustean bed of copyright without killing\r\nit off in the process. Indeed, to some, it seemed to fare very\r\nwell. They would claim that the easy legal protection provided\r\nby copyright gave a nascent industry just enough protection to\r\nencourage the investment of time, talent, and dollars, while not\r\nprohibiting the next generation of companies from building on\r\nthe innovations of the past.\r\n23\r\n\r\nIn addition, the interaction between copyright and software has\r\nproduced some surprising results. There is a strong argument\r\nthat it is the fact that software is copyrightable that has\r\nenabled the \"commons-based creativity\" of free and open source\r\nsoftware. What does commons-based creativity mean? Basically, it\r\nis creativity that builds on an open resource available to all.\r\nAn additional component of some definitions is that the results\r\nof the creativity must be fed back into the commons for all to\r\nuse. Think of English. You can use English without license or\r\nfee, and you can innovate by producing new words, slang, or\r\nphrases without clearance from some Academie Anglaise. After you\r\ncoin your term, it is in turn available to me to build upon or\r\nto use in my own sentences, novels, or jokes. And so the cycle\r\ncontinues. As the last chapter showed, for the entire history of\r\nmusical creativity until the last forty years or so, the same\r\nhad been true of at least a low level of musical borrowing. At\r\nthe basic level of musical phrases, themes, snatches of melody,\r\neven chord structures, music was commons-based creativity.\r\nProperty rights did not reach down into the atomic structure of\r\nmusic. They stayed at a higher level--prohibiting reproduction of\r\ncomplete works or copying of substantial and important chunks.\r\nSo in some areas of both music and language, we had commons-\r\nbased creativity because there were no property rights over the\r\nrelevant level. The software commons is different.\r\n24\r\n\r\nThe creators of free and open source software were able to use\r\nthe fact that software is copyrighted, and that the right\r\nattaches automatically upon creation and fixation, to set up\r\nnew, distributed methods of innovation. For example, free and\r\nopen source software under the General Public License--such as\r\nLinux--is a \"commons\" to which all are granted access. Anyone may\r\nuse the software without any restrictions. They are guaranteed\r\naccess to the human-readable \"source code,\" rather than just the\r\ninscrutable \"machine code,\" so that they can understand, tinker,\r\nand modify. Modifications can be distributed so long as the new\r\ncreation is licensed under the open terms of the original. This\r\ncreates a virtuous cycle: each addition builds on the commons\r\nand is returned to it. The copyright over the software was the\r\n\"hook\" that allowed software engineers to create a license that\r\ngave free access and the right to modify and required future\r\nprogrammers to keep offering those freedoms. Without the\r\ncopyright, those features of the license would not have been\r\nenforceable. For example, someone could have modified the open\r\nprogram and released it without the source code--denying future\r\nusers the right to understand and modify easily. To use an\r\nanalogy beloved of free software enthusiasts, the hood of the\r\ncar would be welded shut. Home repair, tinkering, customization,\r\nand redesign become practically impossible.\r\n25\r\n\r\nOf course, if there were no copyright over software at all,\r\nsoftware engineers would have other freedoms--even if not legally\r\nguaranteed open access to source code. Still, it was hard to\r\ndeny that the extension of the property regime had--bizarrely, at\r\nfirst sight--actually enabled the creation of a continuing open\r\ncommons. The tempting real estate analogy would be\r\nenvironmentalists using strong property rights over land to\r\nguarantee conservation and open access to a green space, where,\r\nwithout property rights, the space could be despoiled by all.\r\nBut as I have pointed out earlier, while such analogies may help\r\nus, the differences between land and intellectual property\r\ndemand that they be scrutinized very carefully. It is hard to\r\novergraze an idea.\r\n26\r\n\r\nSo much for copyright. What about patents? U.S. patent law had\r\ndrawn a firm line between patentable invention and unpatentable\r\nidea, formula, or algorithm. The mousetrap could be patented,\r\nbut not the formula used to calculate the speed at which it\r\nwould snap shut. Ideas, algorithms, and formulae were in the\r\npublic domain--as were \"business methods.\" Or so we thought.\r\n27\r\n\r\nThe line between idea or algorithm on the one hand and\r\npatentable machine on the other looks nice and easy. But put\r\nthat algorithm--that series of steps capable of being specified\r\nin the way described by the Turing machine--onto a computer, and\r\nthings begin to look more complex. Say, for example, that\r\nalgorithm was the process for converting miles into kilometers\r\nand vice versa. \"Take the first number. If it is followed by the\r\nword miles, then multiply by 8/5. If it is followed by the word\r\nkilometers, multiply by 5/8 . . .\" and so on. In the abstract,\r\nthis is classic public domain stuff--no more patentable than\r\nE=mc2 or F=ma. What about when those steps are put onto the tape\r\nof the Turing machine, onto a program running on the hard drive\r\nof a computer?\r\n28\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the United\r\nStates's leading patent court) seems to believe that computers\r\ncan turn unpatentable ideas into patentable machines. In fact,\r\nin this conception, the computer sitting on your desk becomes\r\nmultiple patentable machines--a word processing machine, an e-\r\nmail machine, a machine running the program to calculate the\r\ntensile strength of steel. I want to stress that the other bars\r\nto patentability remain. My example of mile-to-kilometer\r\nconversion would be patentable subject matter but, we hope, no\r\npatent would be granted because the algorithm is not novel and\r\nis obvious. (Sadly, the Patent and Trademark Office seems\r\ndetermined to undermine this hope by granting patents on the\r\nmost mundane and obvious applications.) But the concern here is\r\nnot limited to the idea that without a subject matter bar, too\r\nmany obvious patents will be granted by an overworked and badly\r\nincentivized patent office. It is that the patent was supposed\r\nto be granted at the very end of a process of investigation and\r\nscientific and engineering innovation. The formulae, algorithms,\r\nand scientific discoveries on which the patented invention was\r\nbased remained in the public domain for all to use. It was only\r\nwhen we got to the very end of the process, with a concrete\r\ninnovation ready to go to market, that the patent was to be\r\ngiven. Yet the ability to couple the abstract algorithm with the\r\nconcept of a Turing machine undermines this conception. Suddenly\r\nthe patents are available at the very beginning of the process,\r\neven to people who are merely specifying--in the abstract--the\r\nidea of a computer running a particular series of algorithmic\r\nactivities.\r\n29\r\n\r\nThe words \"by means of a computer\" are--in the eyes of the\r\nFederal Circuit--an incantation of magical power, able to\r\ntransubstantiate the ideas and formulae of the public domain\r\ninto private property. And, like the breaking of a minor taboo\r\nthat presages a Victorian literary character's slide into\r\ndebauchery, once that first wall protecting the public domain\r\nwas breached, the court found it easier and easier to breach\r\nstill others. If one could turn an algorithm into a patentable\r\nmachine simply by adding \"by means of a computer,\" then one\r\ncould turn a business method into something patentable by\r\nspecifying the organizational or information technology\r\nstructure through which the business method is to be\r\nimplemented.\r\n30\r\n\r\nIf you still remember the first chapters of this book, you might\r\nwonder why we would want to patent business methods.\r\nIntellectual property rights are supposed to be handed out only\r\nwhen necessary to produce incentives to supply some public good,\r\nincentives that otherwise would be lacking. Yet there are\r\nalready plenty of incentives to come up with new business\r\nmethods. (Greed and fear are the most obvious.) There is no\r\nevidence to suggest that we need a state-backed monopoly to\r\nencourage the development of new business methods. In fact, we\r\nwant people to copy the businesses of others, lowering prices as\r\na result. The process of copying business methods is called\r\n\"competition\" and it is the basis of a free-market economy. Yet\r\npatent law would prohibit it for twenty years. So why introduce\r\npatents? Brushing aside such minor objections with ease, the\r\nCourt of Appeals for the Federal Circuit declared business\r\nmethods to be patentable. Was this what Jefferson had in mind\r\nwhen he said \"I know well the difficulty of drawing a line\r\nbetween the things which are worth to the public the\r\nembarrassment of an exclusive patent, and those which are not\"?\r\nI doubt it.\r\n31\r\n\r\nIt is commonplace for courts to look at the purpose of the law\r\nthey are enforcing when seeking to understand what it means. In\r\nareas of regulation which are obviously instrumental--aimed at\r\nproducing some particular result in the world--that approach is\r\nubiquitous. In applying the antitrust laws, for example, courts\r\nhave given meaning to the relatively vague words of the law by\r\nturning to economic analysis of the likely effects of different\r\nrules on different market structures.\r\n32\r\n\r\nPatent law is as instrumental a structure as one could imagine.\r\nIn the United States, for example, the constitutional\r\nauthorization to Congress to pass patent and copyright\r\nlegislation is very explicit that these rights are to be made\r\nwith a purpose in view. Congress has the power \"to promote the\r\nprogress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited\r\ntimes to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their\r\nrespective writings and discoveries.\" One might imagine that\r\ncourts would try to interpret the patent and copyright laws with\r\nthat purpose, and the Jefferson Warning about its constraints,\r\nfirmly in mind. Yet utilitarian caution about extending\r\nmonopolies is seldom to be found in the reasoning of our chief\r\npatent court.\r\n33\r\n\r\nThe difference is striking. Jefferson said that the job of those\r\nwho administered the patent system was to see if a patent was\r\n\"worth the embarrassment to the public\" before granting it. The\r\nConstitution tells Congress to make only those patent laws that\r\n\"promote the progress of science and useful arts.\" One might\r\nimagine that this constitutional goal would guide courts in\r\nconstruing those same laws. Yet neither Jeffersonian ideals nor\r\nthe constitutional text seem relevant to our chief patent court\r\nwhen interpreting statutory subject matter. Anything under the\r\nsun made by man is patentable subject matter, and there's an end\r\nto it. The case that announced the rule on business methods\r\ninvolved a patent on the process of keeping accounts in a \"hub-\r\nand-spoke\" mutual fund--which included multiplying all of the\r\nstock holdings of each fund in a family of funds by the\r\nrespective current share price to get total fund value and then\r\ndividing by the number of mutual fund shares that each customer\r\nactually holds to find the balance in their accounts. As my son\r\nobserved, \"I couldn't do that until nearly the end of third\r\ngrade!\"6\r\n34\r\n\r\nIn theory of course, if the patent is not novel or is obvious,\r\nit will still be refused. The Supreme Court recently held that\r\nthe Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has made\r\n\"nonobvious\" too easy a standard to meet.7 It is unclear,\r\nhowever, whether that judgment will produce concrete effects on\r\nactual practices of patent grants and litigation. The Patent and\r\nTrademark Office puts pressure on examiners to issue patents,\r\nand it is very expensive to challenge those that are granted.\r\nBetter, where possible, to rule out certain subject matter in\r\nthe first place. Tempted in part by its flirtation with the\r\n\"idea made machine\" in the context of a computer, the Court of\r\nAppeals for the Federal Circuit could not bring itself to do so.\r\nWhere copyright law evolved to wall off and minimize the dangers\r\nof extending protection over software, patent law actually\r\nextended the idea behind software patents to make patentable any\r\nthought process that might produce a useful result. Once\r\nbreached, the walls protecting the public domain in patent law\r\nshow a disturbing tendency to erode at an increasing rate.\r\n35\r\n\r\nTo sum up, the conceptual possibilities presented to copyright\r\nand patent law by the idea of a Turing machine were fascinating.\r\nShould we extend copyright or patent to cover the new\r\ntechnology? The answer was \"we will extend both!\" Yet the\r\nresults of the extension were complex and unexpected in ways\r\nthat we will have to understand if we want to go beyond the\r\nsimple but important injunctions of Jefferson and Macaulay. Who\r\nwould have predicted that software copyrights could be used to\r\ncreate a self-perpetuating commons as well as a monopoly over\r\noperating systems, or that judges would talk knowingly of\r\nnetwork effects in curtailing the scope of coverage? Who would\r\nhave predicted that patents would be extended not only to basic\r\nalgorithms implemented by a computer, but to methods of business\r\nthemselves (truly a strange return to legalized business\r\nmonopolies for a country whose founders viewed them as one of\r\nthe greatest evils that could be borne)?\r\n36\r\n\r\nSYNTHETIC BIOLOGY\r\n37\r\n\r\nIf you are a reader of Science, PLoS Biology, or Nature, you\r\nwill have noticed some attractive and bizarre photographs\r\nrecently. A field of bacteria that form themselves into bull's-\r\neyes and polka dots. A dim photograph of a woman's face \"taken\"\r\nby bacteria that have been programmed to be sensitive to light.\r\nYou may also have read about more inspiring, if less photogenic,\r\naccomplishments--for example, the group of scientists who managed\r\nto program bacteria to produce artemesinin, a scarce natural\r\nremedy for malaria derived from wormwood. Poking deeper into\r\nthese stories, you would have found the phrase \"synthetic\r\nbiology\" repeated again and again, though a precise definition\r\nwould have eluded you.\r\n38\r\n\r\nWhat is \"synthetic biology\"? For some it is simply that the\r\nproduct or process involves biological materials not found in\r\nnature. Good old-fashioned biotechnology would qualify. One of\r\nthe first biotechnology patent cases, Diamond v. Chakrabarty,\r\ninvolved some bacteria which Dr. Chakrabarty had engineered to\r\neat oil slicks--not their natural foodstuff.8 The Supreme Court\r\nnoted that the bacteria were not found in nature and found them\r\nto be patentable, though alive. According to the simplest\r\ndefinition, Dr. Chakrabarty's process would count as synthetic\r\nbiology, though this example antedates the common use of the\r\nterm by two decades. For other scientists, it is the completely\r\nsynthetic quality of the biology involved that marks the edge of\r\nthe discipline. The DNA we are familiar with, for example, has\r\nfour \"base pairs\"-- A, C, G, and T. Scientists have developed\r\ngenetic alphabets that involve twelve base pairs. Not only is\r\nthe result not found in nature, but the very language in which\r\nit is expressed is entirely new and artificial.\r\n39\r\n\r\nI want to focus on a third conception of synthetic biology: the\r\nidea of turning biotechnology from an artisanal process of one-\r\noff creations, developed with customized techniques, to a true\r\nengineering discipline, using processes and parts that are as\r\nstandardized and as well understood as valves, screws,\r\ncapacitors, or resistors. The electrical engineer told to build\r\na circuit does not go out and invent her own switches or\r\ncapacitors. She can build a circuit using off-the-shelf\r\ncomponents whose performance is expressed using standard\r\nmeasurements. This is the dream of one group of synthetic\r\nbiologists: that biological engineering truly become\r\nengineering, with biological black boxes that perform all of the\r\nstandard functions of electrical or mechanical\r\nengineering--measuring flow, reacting to a high signal by giving\r\nout a low signal, or vice versa, starting or terminating a\r\nsequence, connecting the energy of one process to another, and\r\nso on.\r\n40\r\n\r\nOf course an engineer understands the principle behind a\r\nratchet, or a valve, but he does not have to go through the\r\nprocess of thinking \"as part of this design, I will have to\r\ncreate a thing that lets stuff flow through one way and not the\r\nother.\" The valve is the mechanical unit that stands for that\r\nthought, a concept reified in standardized material form which\r\ndoes not need to be taken apart and parsed each time it is used.\r\nBy contrast, the synthetic biologists claim, much of current\r\nbiotechnological experimentation operates the way a seventeenth-\r\ncentury artisan did. Think of the gunsmith making beautiful one-\r\noff classics for his aristocratic patrons, without standardized\r\ncalibers, parts, or even standard-gauge springs or screws. The\r\nprocess produces the gun, but it does not use, or produce,\r\nstandard parts that can also be used by the next gunsmith.\r\n41\r\n\r\nIs this portrayal of biology correct? Does it involve some\r\nhyping of the new hot field, some denigration of the older\r\ntechniques? I would be shocked, shocked, to find there was hype\r\ninvolved in the scientific or academic enterprise. But whatever\r\nthe degree to which the novelty of this process is being subtly\r\ninflated, it is hard to avoid being impressed by the projects\r\nthat this group of synthetic biologists has undertaken. The MIT\r\nRegistry of Standard Biological Parts, for example, has exactly\r\nthe goal I have just described.\r\n42\r\n\r\n    The development of well-specified, standard, and\r\ninterchangeable biological parts is a critical step towards the\r\ndesign and construction of integrated biological systems. The\r\nMIT Registry of Standard Biological Parts supports this goal by\r\nrecording and indexing biological parts that are currently being\r\nbuilt and offering synthesis and assembly services to construct\r\nnew parts, devices, and systems. . . . In the summer of 2004,\r\nthe Registry contained about 100 basic parts such as operators,\r\nprotein coding regions, and transcriptional terminators, and\r\ndevices such as logic gates built from these basic parts. Today\r\nthe number of parts has increased to about 700 available parts\r\nand 2000 defined parts. The Registry believes in the idea that a\r\nstandard biological part should be well specified and able to be\r\npaired with other parts into subassemblies and whole systems.\r\nOnce the parameters of these parts are determined and\r\nstandardized, simulation and design of genetic systems will\r\nbecome easier and more reliable. The parts in the Registry are\r\nnot simply segments of DNA, they are functional units.9\r\n43\r\n\r\nUsing the Registry, a group of MIT scientists organizes an\r\nannual contest called iGEM, the International Genetically\r\nEngineered Machine competition. Students can draw from the\r\nstandard parts that the Registry contains, and perhaps\r\ncontribute their own creations back to it. What kinds of\r\n\"genetically engineered machines\" do they build?\r\n44\r\n\r\n    A team of eight undergraduates from the University of\r\nLjubljana in Slovenia-- cheering and leaping onto MIT's Kresge\r\nAuditorium stage in green team T-shirts-- won the grand prize\r\nearlier this month at the International Genetically Engineered\r\nMachine (iGEM) competition at MIT. The group--which received an\r\nengraved award in the shape of a large aluminum Lego\r\npiece--explored a way to use engineered cells to intercept the\r\nbody's excessive response to infection, which can lead to a\r\nfatal condition called sepsis. The goal of the 380 students on\r\n35 university teams from around the world was to build\r\nbiological systems the way a contractor would build a house--with\r\na toolkit of standard parts. iGEM participants spent the summer\r\nimmersed in the growing field of synthetic biology, creating\r\nsimple systems from interchangeable parts that operate in living\r\ncells. Biology, once thought too complicated to be engineered\r\nlike a clock, computer or microwave oven, has proven to be open\r\nto manipulation at the genetic level. The new creations are\r\nengineered from snippets of DNA, the molecules that run living\r\ncells.10\r\n45\r\n\r\nOther iGEM entries have included E. coli bacteria that had been\r\nengineered to smell like wintergreen while they were growing and\r\ndividing and like bananas when they were finished, a\r\nbiologically engineered detector that would change color when\r\nexposed to unhealthy levels of arsenic in drinking water, a\r\nmethod of programming mouse stem cells to \"differentiate\" into\r\nmore specialized cells on command, and the mat of picture-taking\r\nbacteria I mentioned earlier.\r\n46\r\n\r\nNo matter how laudable the arsenic detector or the experimental\r\ntechnique dealing with sepsis, or how cool the idea of banana-\r\nscented, picture-taking bacteria, this kind of enterprise will\r\ncause some of you to shudder. Professor Drew Endy, one of the\r\npioneers in this field, believes that part of that reaction\r\nstems from simple novelty. \"A lot of people who were scaring\r\nfolks in 1975 now have Nobel prizes.\"11 But even if inchoate,\r\nthe concerns that synthetic biology arouses stem from more than\r\nnovelty. There is a deep-seated fear that if we see the natural\r\nworld of biology as merely another system that we can routinely\r\nengineer, we will have extended our technocratic methods into a\r\nrealm that was only intermittently subject to them in a way that\r\nthreatens both our structure of self-understanding and our\r\necosystem.\r\n47\r\n\r\nTo this, the synthetic biologists respond that we are already\r\nengineering nature. In their view, planned, structured, and\r\nrationalized genetic engineering poses fewer dangers than poorly\r\nunderstood interventions to produce some specific result in\r\ncomparative ignorance of the processes we are employing to do\r\nso. If the \"code\" is transparent, subject to review by a peer\r\ncommunity, and based on known parts and structures, each\r\nidentified by a standard genetic \"barcode,\" then the chance of\r\ndetecting problems and solving them is higher. And while the\r\ndangers are real and not to be minimized, the potential\r\nbenefits--the lives saved because the scarce antimalarial drug\r\ncan now be manufactured by energetic E. coli or because a cheap\r\ntest can demonstrate arsenic contamination in a village well--are\r\nnot to be minimized either.\r\n48\r\n\r\nI first became aware of synthetic biology when a number of the\r\nscientists working on the Registry of Standard Biological Parts\r\ncontacted me and my colleague Arti Rai. They did not use these\r\nexact words, but their question boiled down to \"how does\r\nsynthetic biology fare in intellectual property's categories,\r\nand how can we keep the basics of the science open for all to\r\nuse?\" As you can tell from this book, I find intellectual\r\nproperty fascinating--lamentably so perhaps. Nevertheless, I was\r\ndepressed by the idea that scientists would have to spend their\r\nvaluable time trying to work out how to save their discipline\r\nfrom being messed up by the law. Surely it would be better to\r\nhave them doing, well, science?\r\n49\r\n\r\nThey have cause for concern. As I mentioned at the beginning of\r\nthis chapter, synthetic biology shares characteristics of both\r\nsoftware and biotechnology. Remember the focus on reducing\r\nfunctions to black boxes. Synthetic biologists are looking for\r\nthe biological equivalents of switches, valves, and inverters.\r\nThe more abstractly these are described, the more they come to\r\nresemble simple algebraic expressions, replete with \"if, then\"\r\nstatements and instructions that resolve to \"if x, then y, if\r\nnot x, then z.\"\r\n50\r\n\r\nIf this sounds reminiscent of the discussion of the Turing\r\nmachine, it should. When the broad rules for software and\r\nbusiness methods were enunciated by the federal courts, software\r\nwas already a developed industry. Even though the rules would\r\nhave allowed the equivalent of patenting the alphabet, the very\r\nmaturity of the field minimized the disruption such patents\r\ncould cause. Of course \"prior art\" was not always written down.\r\nEven when it was recorded, it was sometimes badly handled by the\r\nexaminers and the courts, partly because they set a very\r\nundemanding standard for \"ordinary expertise\" in the art.\r\nNevertheless, there was still a lot of prior experience and it\r\nrendered some of the more basic claims incredible. That is not\r\ntrue in the synthetic biology field.\r\n51\r\n\r\nConsider a recent article in Nature, \"A universal RNAi-based\r\nlogic evaluator that operates in mammalian cells.\"12 The\r\nscientists describe their task in terms that should be familiar.\r\n\"A molecular automaton is an engineered molecular system coupled\r\nto a (bio)molecular environment by 'flow of incoming messages\r\nand the actions of outgoing messages,' where the incoming\r\nmessages are processed by an 'intermediate set of elements,'\r\nthat is, a computer.\" The article goes on to describe some of\r\nthe key elements of so-called \"Boolean algebra\"-- \"or,\" \"and,\"\r\n\"not,\" and so on--implemented in living mammalian cells.\r\n52\r\n\r\nThese inscriptions of Boolean algebra in cells and DNA sequences\r\ncan be patented. The U.S. Department of Health and Human\r\nServices, for example, owns patent number 6,774,222:\r\n53\r\n\r\n    This invention relates to novel molecular constructs that\r\nact as various logic elements, i.e., gates and flip-flops. . . .\r\nThe basic functional unit of the construct comprises a nucleic\r\nacid having at least two protein binding sites that cannot be\r\nsimultaneously occupied by their cognate binding protein. This\r\nbasic unit can be assembled in any number of formats providing\r\nmolecular constructs that act like traditional digital logic\r\nelements (flips-flops, gates, inverters, etc.).\r\n54\r\n\r\nMy colleagues Arti Rai and Sapna Kumar have performed a patent\r\nsearch and found many more patents of similar breadth.13\r\n55\r\n\r\nWhat is the concern? After all, this is cutting-edge science.\r\nThese seem like novel, nonobvious inventions with considerable\r\nutility. The concern is that the change in the rules over\r\npatentable subject matter, coupled with the Patent and Trademark\r\nOffice's handling of both software and biotechnology, will come\r\ntogether so that the patent is not over some particular\r\nbiological circuit, but, rather, over Boolean algebra itself as\r\nimplemented by any biotechnological means. It would be as if,\r\nright at the beginning of the computer age, we had issued\r\npatents over formal logic in software--not over a particular\r\ncomputer design, but over the idea of a computer or a binary\r\ncircuit itself.\r\n56\r\n\r\n\"By means of a computer\" was the magic phrase that caused the\r\nwalls around the public domain of algorithms and ideas to\r\ncrumble. Will \"by means of a biological circuit\" do the same?\r\nAnd--to repeat the key point--unlike computer science,\r\nbiotechnology is developing after the hypertrophy of our\r\nintellectual property system. We do not have the immune system\r\nprovided by the established practices and norms, the \"prior\r\nart,\" even the community expectations that protected software\r\nfrom the worst effects of patents over the building blocks of\r\nscience.\r\n57\r\n\r\nFollowing the example of software, the founders of the MIT\r\nRegistry of Standard Biological Parts had the idea of protecting\r\ntheir discipline from overly expansive intellectual property\r\nclaims by turning those rights against themselves. Free and open\r\nsource software developers have created a \"commons\" using the\r\ncopyright over the code to impose a license on their software,\r\none that requires subsequent developers to keep the source open\r\nand to give improvements back to the software commons--a virtuous\r\ncycle. Could the Registry of Standard Biological Parts do the\r\nsame thing? The software commons rests on a license. But, as I\r\npointed out in the last section, the license depends on an\r\nunderlying property right. It is because I have automatic\r\ncopyright over my code that I can tell you \"use it according to\r\nthese terms or you will be violating my copyright.\" Is there a\r\ncopyright over the products of synthetic biology? To create one\r\nwe would have to take the extension of copyright that was\r\nrequired to reach software and stretch it even further. Bill\r\nGates might argue for intellectual property rights over software\r\nusing the logic of his article in Dr. Dobb's Journal. Will the\r\nargument for copyrights over synthetic biological coding be \"I\r\nneed the property right so I can create a commons\"?\r\n58\r\n\r\nIn practice, I think the answer is, and should be, no. Of\r\ncourse, one could think of this as just another type of coding,\r\nmaking expressive choices in a code of A's, C's, G's, and T's,\r\njust as a programmer does in Java or C??. Yet, software was\r\nalready a stretch for copyright law. Synthetic biology strikes\r\nme as a subject matter that the courts, Congress, and the\r\nCopyright Office are unlikely to want to cram into copyright's\r\nalready distorted outlines-- particularly given the obvious\r\navailability of patent rights. As a matter of conceptual\r\nintuition, I think they will see biological subject matter as\r\nharder to fit into the categories of original expressive\r\nwriting. On one level, yes, it is all information, but, on\r\nanother level, the idea of programming with gene sequences will\r\nprobably raise hackles that the idea of coding inside a\r\nprogramming language never would. As a normative matter, I think\r\nit would be a poor choice to apply copyright to the products of\r\nsynthetic biology. Attempting to produce a particular open\r\ncommons, one might enable the kind of hundred-year monopolies\r\nover functional objects that the critics of software copyright\r\ninitially feared.\r\n59\r\n\r\nIf one wishes to keep the basic ideas and techniques of\r\nsynthetic biology open for subsequent innovators, there are\r\nalternatives to the idea of a synthetic biology open source\r\nlicense. The Registry of Standard Biological Parts or the\r\nBioBricks Foundation can simply put all their work into the\r\npublic domain immediately. (This, indeed, is what they are\r\ncurrently doing.) Such a scheme lacks one key feature of open\r\nsource software: the right to force subsequent innovators to\r\nrelease their code back into the commons. Yet it would make\r\nsubsequent patents on the material impossible, because it had\r\nalready been published.\r\n60\r\n\r\nRegardless of the decisions made about the future of synthetic\r\nbiology, I think its story--coupled to that of software and\r\nbiotechnology more generally--presents us with an important\r\nlesson. I started the chapter with the metaphor of Procrustes's\r\nbed. But in the case of software and biotechnology, both the\r\nbed--the categories of copyright and patent--and its\r\ninhabitants--the new technologies--were stretched. Cracks formed\r\nin the boundaries that were supposed to prevent copyright from\r\nbeing applied to functional articles, to prevent patents\r\nextending to cover ideas, algorithms, and business methods.\r\n61\r\n\r\nUntil this point, though the science would have been strange to\r\nJefferson or his contemporaries, the underlying issue would have\r\nbeen familiar. The free-trade, Scottish Enlightenment thinkers\r\nof the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries would have scoffed at\r\nthe idea that business methods or algorithms could be patented,\r\nlet alone that one could patent the \"or,\" \"if-then,\" and \"not\"\r\nfunctions of Boolean algebra as implemented by a biological\r\nmechanism. The response, presumably, is to fine tune our patent\r\nstandards--to patent the mousetrap and the corkscrew, not the\r\nnotion of catching mice or opening bottles by mechanical means.\r\nStill less should we allow the patenting of algebra. These are\r\nfine points. Later scholarship has added formulae, data, and\r\nhistorical analysis to back up Jefferson's concerns, while never\r\nsurpassing his prose. As I said at the beginning of the book, if\r\nwe were to print out the Jefferson Warning and slip it into the\r\nshirt pocket of every legislator and regulator, our policy would\r\nbe remarkably improved.\r\n62\r\n\r\nBut it is here that the story takes a new turn, something that\r\nneither Jefferson nor the philosophers of the Scottish\r\nEnlightenment had thought of, something that goes beyond their\r\ncautions not to confuse intellectual property with physical\r\nproperty, to keep its boundaries, scope, and term as small as\r\npossible while still encouraging the desired innovation.\r\n63\r\n\r\nThink of the reaction of the synthetic biologists at MIT. They\r\nfeared that the basic building blocks of their new discipline\r\ncould be locked up, slowing the progress of science and research\r\nby inserting intellectual property rights at the wrong point in\r\nthe research cycle. To solve the problem they were led seriously\r\nto consider claiming copyright over the products of synthetic\r\nbiology--to fight overly broad patent rights with a privately\r\nconstructed copyright commons, to ride the process of legal\r\nexpansion and turn it to their own ends. As I pointed out\r\nearlier, I think the tactic would not fare well in this\r\nparticular case. But it is an example of a new move in the\r\ndebate over intellectual property, a new tactic: the attempt to\r\ncreate a privately constructed commons where the public domain\r\ncreated by the state does not give you the freedom that you\r\nbelieve creativity needs in order to thrive. It is to that\r\ntactic, and the distributed creativity that it enables, that I\r\nwill turn to now.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 8: A Creative Commons\r\n1\r\n\r\nIf you go to the familiar Google search page and click the\r\nintimidating link marked \"advanced search,\" you come to a page\r\nthat gives you more fine-grained control over the framing of\r\nyour query. Nestled among the choices that allow you to pick\r\nyour desired language, or exclude raunchy content, is an option\r\nthat says \"usage rights.\" Click \"free to use or share\" and then\r\nsearch for \"physics textbook\" and you can download a 1,200-page\r\nphysics textbook, copy it, or even print it out and hand it to\r\nyour students. Search for \"Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom\"\r\nand you will find Cory Doctorow's fabulous science fiction\r\nnovel, online, in full, for free. His other novels are there\r\ntoo--with the willing connivance of his commercial publisher.\r\nSearch for \"David Byrne, My Fair Lady\" and you will be able to\r\ndownload Byrne's song and make copies for your friends. You'll\r\nfind songs from Gilberto Gil and the Beastie Boys on the same\r\npage. No need to pay iTunes or worry about breaking the law.\r\n2\r\n\r\nGo to the \"advanced\" page on Flickr, the popular photo sharing\r\nsite, and you will find a similar choice marked \"Creative\r\nCommons License.\" Check that box and then search for \"Duke\r\nChapel\" and you will get a selection of beautiful photos of the\r\nlovely piece of faux Gothic architecture that sits about three\r\nhundred yards from the office where I am writing these words.\r\nYou can copy those photos, and 66 million others on different\r\nsubjects, share them with your friends, print them for your\r\nwall, and, in some cases, even use them commercially. The same\r\nbasic tools can be found on a range of specialized search\r\nengines with names like OWL Music Search, BlipTV, SpinExpress,\r\nand OERCommons. Searching those sites, or just sticking with the\r\nadvanced options on Google or Yahoo, will get you courses in\r\nmusic theory, moral philosophy, and C++ programming from famous\r\nuniversities; a full-length movie called Teach by Oscar-winning\r\ndirector Davis Guggenheim; and free architectural drawings that\r\ncan be used to build low-cost housing. At the Wellcome Library,\r\nyou will find two thousand years of medical images that can be\r\nshared freely. Searching for \"skeleton\" is particularly fun. You\r\ncan even go to your favorite search engine, type in the title of\r\nthis book, find a site that will allow you to download it, and\r\nsend the PDF to a hundred friends, warmly anticipating their\r\nrapturous enjoyment. (Better ask them first.)\r\n3\r\n\r\nAll this copying and sharing and printing sounds illegal, but it\r\nis not (at least if you went through the steps I described). And\r\nthe things you can do with this content do not stop with simply\r\nreproducing it, printing it on paper, or sending it by e-mail.\r\nMuch of it can be changed, customized, remixed--you could rewrite\r\nthe module of the class and insert your own illustrations,\r\nanimate the graphs showing calculus in action, morph the photo\r\ninto something new. If you search for a musician with the\r\nunpromising name \"Brad Sucks,\" you will find a Web site bearing\r\nthe modest subtitle \"A one man band with no fans.\" Brad, it\r\nturns out, does not suck and has many fans. What makes him\r\nparticularly interesting is that he allows those fans, or anyone\r\nelse for that matter, to remix his music and post their\r\ncreations online. I am particularly fond of the Matterovermind\r\nremix of \"Making Me Nervous,\" but it may not be to your taste.\r\nGo to a site called ccMixter and you will find that musicians,\r\nfamous and obscure, are inviting you to sample and remix their\r\nmusic. Or search Google for Colin Mutchler and listen to a\r\nhaunting song called \"My Life Changed.\" Mr. Mutchler and a\r\nviolinist called Cora Beth Bridges whom he had never met created\r\nthat song together. He posted a song called \"My Life\" online,\r\ngiving anyone the freedom to add to it, and she did--\"My Life.\"\r\nChanged.\r\n4\r\n\r\nOn December 15, 2002, in San Francisco, a charitable\r\norganization called Creative Commons was launched. (Full\r\ndisclosure: I have been a proud board member of Creative Commons\r\nsince its creation.) Creative Commons was the brainchild of\r\nLarry Lessig, Hal Abelson, and Eric Eldred. All the works I have\r\njust described--and this book itself--are under Creative Commons\r\nlicenses. The authors and creators of those works have chosen to\r\nshare it with the world, with you, under generous terms, while\r\nreserving certain rights for themselves. They may have allowed\r\nyou to copy it, but not to alter it--to make derivative works. Or\r\nthey may have allowed you to use it as you wish, so long as you\r\ndo so noncommercially. Or they may have given you complete\r\nfreedom, provided only that you attribute them as the owner of\r\nthe work. There are a few simple choices and a limited menu of\r\npermutations.\r\n5\r\n\r\nWhat makes these licenses unusual is that they can be read by\r\ntwo groups that normal licenses exclude--human beings (rather\r\nthan just lawyers) and computers. The textbooks, photos, films,\r\nand songs have a tasteful little emblem on them marked with a\r\n\"cc\" which, if you click on it, links to a \"Commons Deed,\" a\r\nsimple one-page explanation of the freedoms you have. There are\r\neven icons--a dollar with a slash through it, for example--that\r\nmake things even clearer. Better still, the reason the search\r\nengines could find this material is that the licenses also\r\n\"tell\" search engines exactly what freedoms have been given.\r\nSimple \"metadata\" (a fancy word for tags that computers can\r\nread) mark the material with its particular level of freedoms.\r\nThis is not digital rights management. The license will not try\r\nto control your computer, install itself on your hard drive, or\r\nbreak your TV. It is just an expression of the terms under which\r\nthe author has chosen to release the work. That means that if\r\nyou search Google or Flickr for \"works I am free to share, even\r\ncommercially,\" you know you can go into business selling those\r\ntextbooks, or printing those photos on mugs and T-shirts, so\r\nlong as you give the author attribution. If you search for \"show\r\nme works I can build on,\" you know you are allowed to make what\r\ncopyright lawyers call \"derivative works.\"\r\n6\r\n\r\nThe idea behind Creative Commons was simple. As I pointed out in\r\nthe first chapter, copyright adheres automatically on\r\n\"fixation.\" As soon as you lift the pen from the paper, click\r\nthe shutter, or save the file, the work is copyrighted. No\r\nformalities. No need even to use the little symbol (C). Once\r\ncopyrighted, the work is protected by the full might of the\r\nlegal system. And the legal system's default setting is that\r\n\"all rights are reserved\" to the author, which means effectively\r\nthat anyone but the author is forbidden to copy, adapt, or\r\npublicly perform the work. This might have been a fine rule for\r\na world in which there were high barriers to publication. The\r\nmaterial that was not published was theoretically under an \"all\r\nrights reserved\" regime, but who cared? It was practically\r\ninaccessible anyway. After the development of the World Wide\r\nWeb, all that had changed. Suddenly people and institutions,\r\nmillions upon millions of them, were putting content\r\nonline--blogs, photo sites, videologs, podcasts, course\r\nmaterials. It was all just up there.\r\n7\r\n\r\nBut what could you do with it? You could read it, or look at it,\r\nor play it presumably--otherwise why had the author put it up?\r\nBut could you copy it? Put it on your own site? Include it in a\r\nmanual used by the whole school district? E-mail it to someone?\r\nTranslate it into your own language? Quote beyond the boundaries\r\nof fair use? Adapt for your own purposes? Take the song and use\r\nit for your video? Of course, if you really wanted the work a\r\nlot, you could try to contact the author--not always easy. And\r\none by one, we could all contact each other and ask for\r\nparticular types of permissions for use. If the use was large\r\nenough or widespread enough, perhaps we would even think that an\r\nindividual contract was necessary. Lawyers could be hired and\r\nterms hashed out.\r\n8\r\n\r\nAll this would be fine if the author wished to retain all the\r\nrights that copyright gives and grant them only individually,\r\nfor pay, with lawyers in the room. But what about the authors,\r\nthe millions upon millions of writers, and photographers and\r\nmusicians, and filmmakers and bloggers and scholars, who very\r\nmuch want to share their work? The Cora Beth Bridges of the\r\nworld are never going to write individual letters to the Colin\r\nMutchlers of the world asking for permission to make a\r\nderivative work out of \"My Life.\" The person who translated my\r\narticles into Spanish or Mandarin, or the people who repost them\r\non their Web sites, or include them in their anthologies might\r\nhave asked permission if I had not granted it in advance. I\r\ndoubt though that I would have been contacted by the very\r\ntalented person who took images from a comic book about fair use\r\nthat I co-wrote and mashed them up with words from a book by\r\nLarry Lessig, and some really nice music from someone none of us\r\nhad ever met. Without some easy way to give permission in\r\nadvance, and to do so in a way that human beings and computers,\r\nas well as lawyers, can understand, those collaborations will\r\nnever happen, though all the parties would be delighted if they\r\ndid. These are losses from \"failed sharing\"--every bit as real as\r\nlosses from unauthorized copying, but much less in the public\r\neye.\r\n9\r\n\r\nCreative Commons was conceived as a private \"hack\" to produce a\r\nmore fine-tuned copyright structure, to replace \"all rights\r\nreserved\" with \"some rights reserved\" for those who wished to do\r\nso. It tried to do for culture what the General Public License\r\nhad done for software. It made use of the same technologies that\r\nhad created the issue: the technologies that made fixation of\r\nexpressive content and its distribution to the world something\r\nthat people, as well as large concentrations of capital, could\r\ndo. As a result, it was able to attract a surprising range of\r\nsupport--Jack Valenti of the Motion Picture Association of\r\nAmerica and Hillary Rosen of the Recording Industry Association\r\nof America, as well as John Perry Barlow of the Grateful Dead,\r\nwhose attitude toward intellectual property was distinctly less\r\nfavorable. Why could they all agree? These licenses were not a\r\nchoice forced on anyone. The author was choosing what to share\r\nand under what terms. But that sharing created something\r\ndifferent, something new. It was more than a series of isolated\r\nactions. The result was the creation of a global \"commons\" of\r\nmaterial that was open to all, provided they adhered to the\r\nterms of the licenses. Suddenly it was possible to think of\r\ncreating a work entirely out of Creative Commons-licensed\r\ncontent--text, photos, movies, music. Your coursebook on music\r\ntheory, or your documentary on the New York skyline, could\r\ncombine your own original material with high-quality text,\r\nillustrations, photos, video, and music created by strangers.\r\nOne could imagine entire fields--of open educational content or\r\nof open music--in which creators could work without keeping one\r\neye nervously on legal threats or permissions.\r\n10\r\n\r\nFrom one perspective, Creative Commons looks like a simple\r\ndevice for enabling exercise of authorial control, remarkable\r\nonly for the extremely large number of authors making that\r\nchoice and the simplicity with which they can do so. From\r\nanother, it can be seen as re-creating, by private choice and\r\nautomated licenses, the world of creativity before law had\r\npermeated to the finest, most atomic level of science and\r\nculture--the world of folk music or 1950s jazz, of jokes and\r\nslang and recipes, of Ray Charles's \"rewording\" of gospel songs,\r\nor of Isaac Newton describing himself as \"standing on the\r\nshoulders of giants\" (and not having to pay them royalties).\r\nRemember, that is not a world without intellectual property. The\r\ncookbook might be copyrighted even if the recipe was not. Folk\r\nmusic makes it to the popular scene and is sold as a copyrighted\r\nproduct. The jazz musician \"freezes\" a particular version of the\r\nimprovisation on a communally shared set of musical motifs,\r\nrecords it, and sometimes even claims ownership of it. Newton\r\nhimself was famously touchy about precedence and attribution,\r\neven if not about legal ownership of his ideas. But it is a\r\nworld in which creativity and innovation proceed on the basis of\r\nan extremely large \"commons\" of material into which it was never\r\nimagined that property rights could permeate.\r\n11\r\n\r\nFor many of us, Creative Commons was conceived of as a second-\r\nbest solution created by private agreement because the best\r\nsolution could not be obtained through public law. The best\r\nsolution would be a return of the formality requirement--a\r\nrequirement that one at least write the words \"James Boyle\r\ncopyright 2008,\" for example, in order to get more than 100\r\nyears of legal protection backed by \"strict liability\" and\r\nfederal criminal law. Those who did not wish to have the legal\r\nmonopoly could omit the phrase and the work would pass into the\r\npublic domain, with a period of time during which the author\r\ncould claim copyright retrospectively if the phrase was omitted\r\nby accident. The default position would become freedom and the\r\ndead weight losses caused by giving legal monopolies to those\r\nwho had not asked for them, and did not want them, would\r\ndisappear. To return to the words of Justice Brandeis that I\r\nquoted at the beginning of the book:\r\n12\r\n\r\n    The general rule of law is, that the noblest of human\r\nproductions--knowledge, truths ascertained, conceptions, and\r\nideas--become, after voluntary communication to others, free as\r\nthe air to common use. Upon these incorporeal productions the\r\nattribute of property is continued after such communication only\r\nin certain classes of cases where public policy has seemed to\r\ndemand it.\r\n13\r\n\r\nBrandeis echoes the Jeffersonian preference for a norm of\r\nfreedom, with narrowly constrained exceptions only when\r\nnecessary. That preference means that the commons of which I\r\nspoke is a relatively large one--property rights are the\r\nexception, not the norm. Of course, many of those who use\r\nCreative Commons licenses might disagree with that policy\r\npreference and with every idea in this book. They may worship\r\nthe DMCA or just want a way to get their song or their article\r\nout there while retaining some measure of control. That does not\r\nmatter. The licenses are agnostic. Like a land trust which has a\r\nlocal pro-growth industrialist and a local environmentalist on\r\nits board, they permit us to come to a restricted agreement on\r\ngoals (\"make sure this space is available to the public\") even\r\nwhen underlying ideologies differ. They do this using those most\r\nconservative of tools--property rights and licenses. And yet, if\r\nour vision of property is \"sole and despotic dominion,\" these\r\nlicenses have created something very different--a commons has\r\nbeen made out of private and exclusive rights.\r\n14\r\n\r\nMy point here is that Creative Commons licenses or the tools of\r\nfree and open source software--to which I will turn in a\r\nmoment--represent something more than merely a second-best\r\nsolution to a poorly chosen rule. They represent a visible\r\nexample of a type of creativity, of innovation, which has been\r\naround for a very long time, but which has reached new salience\r\non the Internet--distributed creativity based around a shared\r\ncommons of material.\r\n15\r\n\r\nFREE AND OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE\r\n16\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Clay Shirky, an incisive commentator on networked\r\nculture, gave a speech which anyone but a Net aficionado might\r\nhave found simultaneously romantic and impenetrable. He started\r\nby telling the story of a Shinto shrine that has been\r\npainstakingly rebuilt to exactly the same plan many times over\r\nits 1,300-year life--and which was denied certification as a\r\nhistoric building as a result. Shirky's point? What was\r\nremarkable was not the building. It was a community that would\r\ncontinue to build and rebuild the thing for more than a\r\nmillennium.\r\n17\r\n\r\nFrom there, Shirky shifted to a discussion of his attempt to get\r\nAT&T to adopt the high-level programming language Perl--which is\r\nreleased as free and open source software under the General\r\nPublic License. From its initial creation by Larry Wall in 1987,\r\nPerl has been adapted, modified, and developed by an\r\nextraordinary range of talented programmers, becoming more\r\npowerful and flexible in the process. As Shirky recounts the\r\nstory, when the AT&T representatives asked \"where do you get\r\nyour support?\" Shirky responded, \" 'we get our support from a\r\ncommunity'--which to them sounded a bit like 'we get our\r\nThursdays from a banana.' \" Shirky concluded the speech thus:\r\n18\r\n\r\n    We have always loved one another. We're human. It's\r\nsomething we're good at. But up until recently, the radius and\r\nhalf-life of that affection has been quite limited. With love\r\nalone, you can plan a birthday party. Add coordinating tools and\r\nyou can write an operating system. In the past, we would do\r\nlittle things for love, but big things required money. Now we\r\ncan do big things for love.1\r\n\r\n19\r\n\r\nThere are a few people out there for whom \"operating systems\"\r\nand \"love\" could plausibly coexist in a sentence not constructed\r\nby an infinite number of monkeys. For most though, the question\r\nis, what could he possibly have meant?\r\n20\r\n\r\nThe arguments in this book so far have taken as a given the\r\nincentives and collective action problems to which intellectual\r\nproperty is a response. Think of Chapter 1 and the economic\r\nexplanation of \"public goods.\" The fact that it is expensive to\r\ndo the research to find the right drug, but cheap to manufacture\r\nit once it is identified provides a reason to create a legal\r\nright of exclusion. In those realms where the innovation would\r\nnot have happened anyway, the legal right of exclusion gives a\r\npower to price above cost, which in turn gives incentives to\r\ncreators and distributors. So goes the theory. I have discussed\r\nthe extent to which the logic of enclosure works for the commons\r\nof the mind as well as it did for the arable commons, taking\r\ninto account the effects of an information society and a global\r\nInternet. What I have not done is asked whether a global network\r\nactually transforms some of our assumptions about how creation\r\nhappens in a way that reshapes the debate about the need for\r\nincentives, at least in certain areas. This, however, is exactly\r\nthe question that needs to be asked.\r\n21\r\n\r\nFor anyone interested in the way that networks can enable new\r\ncollaborative methods of production, the free software movement,\r\nand the broader but less political movement that goes under the\r\nname of open source software, provide interesting case studies.2\r\nOpen source software is released under a series of licenses, the\r\nmost important being the General Public License (GPL). The GPL\r\nspecifies that anyone may copy the software, provided the\r\nlicense remains attached and the source code for the software\r\nalways remains available.3 Users may add to or modify the code,\r\nmay build on it and incorporate it into their own work, but if\r\nthey do so, then the new program created is also covered by the\r\nGPL. Some people refer to this as the \"viral\" nature of the\r\nlicense; others find the term offensive.4 The point, however, is\r\nthat the open quality of the creative enterprise spreads. It is\r\nnot simply a donation of a program or a work to the public\r\ndomain, but a continual accretion in which all gain the benefits\r\nof the program on pain of agreeing to give their additions and\r\ninnovations back to the communal project.\r\n22\r\n\r\nFor the whole structure to work without large-scale centralized\r\ncoordination, the creation process has to be modular, with units\r\nof different sizes and complexities, each requiring slightly\r\ndifferent expertise, all of which can be added together to make\r\na grand whole. I can work on the sendmail program, you on the\r\nsearch algorithms. More likely, lots of people try, their\r\nefforts are judged by the community, and the best ones are\r\nadopted. Under these conditions, this curious mix of Kropotkin\r\nand Adam Smith, Richard Dawkins and Richard Stallman, we get\r\ndistributed production without having to rely on the proprietary\r\nexclusion model. The whole enterprise will be much, much, much\r\ngreater than the sum of the parts.\r\n23\r\n\r\nWhat's more, and this is a truly fascinating twist, when the\r\nproduction process does need more centralized coordination, some\r\ngovernance that guides how the sticky modular bits are put\r\ntogether, it is at least theoretically possible that we can come\r\nup with the control system in exactly the same way. In this\r\nsense, distributed production is potentially recursive.\r\nGovernance processes, too, can be assembled through distributed\r\nmethods on a global network, by people with widely varying\r\nmotivations, skills, and reserve prices.5\r\n24\r\n\r\nThe free and open source software movements have produced\r\nsoftware that rivals or, some claim, exceeds the capabilities of\r\nconventional proprietary, binary-only software.6 Its adoption on\r\nthe \"enterprise level\" is impressive, as is the number and\r\nenthusiasm of the various technical testaments to its strengths.\r\nYou have almost certainly used open source software or been its\r\nbeneficiary. Your favorite Web site or search engine may run on\r\nit. If your browser is Firefox, you use it every day. It powers\r\nsurprising things around you--your ATM or your TiVo. The plane\r\nyou are flying in may be running it. It just works.\r\n25\r\n\r\nGovernments have taken notice. The United Kingdom, for example,\r\nconcluded last year that open source software \"will be\r\nconsidered alongside proprietary software and contracts will be\r\nawarded on a value-for-money basis.\" The Office of Government\r\nCommerce said open source software is \"a viable desktop\r\nalternative for the majority of government users\" and \"can\r\ngenerate significant savings. . . . These trials have proved\r\nthat open source software is now a real contender alongside\r\nproprietary solutions. If commercial companies and other\r\ngovernments are taking it seriously, then so must we.\"7 Sweden\r\nfound open source software to be in many cases \"equivalent to--or\r\nbetter than--commercial products\" and concluded that software\r\nprocurement \"shall evaluate open software as well as commercial\r\nsolutions, to provide better competition in the market.\"8\r\n26\r\n\r\nWhat is remarkable is not merely that the software works\r\ntechnically, but that it is an example of widespread, continued,\r\nhigh-quality innovation. The really remarkable thing is that it\r\nworks socially, as a continuing system, sustained by a network\r\nconsisting both of volunteers and of individuals employed by\r\ncompanies such as IBM and Google whose software \"output\" is\r\nnevertheless released into the commons.\r\n27\r\n\r\nHere, it seems, we have a classic public good: code that can be\r\ncopied freely and sold or redistributed without paying the\r\ncreator or creators. This sounds like a tragedy of the commons\r\nof the kind that I described in the first three chapters of the\r\nbook. Obviously, with a nonrival, nonexcludable good like\r\nsoftware, this method of production cannot be sustained; there\r\nare inadequate incentives to ensure continued production. E pur\r\nsi muove, as Galileo is apocryphally supposed to have said in\r\nthe face of Cardinal Bellarmine's certainties: \"And yet it\r\nmoves.\"9 Or, as Clay Shirky put it, \"we get our support from a\r\ncommunity.\"\r\n28\r\n\r\nFor a fair amount of time, most economists looked at open source\r\nsoftware and threw up their hands. From their point of view, \"we\r\nget our support from a community\" did indeed sound like \"we get\r\nour Thursdays from a banana.\" There is an old economics joke\r\nabout the impossibility of finding a twenty-dollar bill lying on\r\na sidewalk. In an efficient market, the money would already have\r\nbeen picked up. (Do not wait for a punch line.) When economists\r\nlooked at open source software they saw not a single twenty-\r\ndollar bill lying implausibly on the sidewalk, but whole bushels\r\nof them. Why would anyone work on a project the fruits of which\r\ncould be appropriated by anyone? Since copyright adheres on\r\nfixation--since the computer programmer already has the legal\r\npower to exclude others--why would he or she choose to take the\r\nextra step of adopting a license that undermined that exclusion?\r\nWhy would anyone choose to allow others to use and modify the\r\nresults of their hard work? Why would they care whether the\r\nnewcomers, in turn, released their contributions back into the\r\ncommons?\r\n29\r\n\r\nThe puzzles went beyond the motivations of the people engaging\r\nin this particular form of \"distributed creativity.\" How could\r\nthese implausible contributions be organized? How should we\r\nunderstand this strange form of organization? It is not a\r\ncompany or a government bureaucracy. What could it be? To\r\nRichard Epstein, the answer was obvious and pointed to a reason\r\nthe experiment must inevitably end in failure:\r\n30\r\n\r\n    The open source movement shares many features with a\r\nworkers' commune, and is likely to fail for the same reason: it\r\ncannot scale up to meet its own successes. To see the long-term\r\ndifficulty, imagine a commune entirely owned by its original\r\nworkers who share pro rata in its increases in value. The system\r\nmight work well in the early days when the workforce remains\r\nfixed. But what happens when a given worker wants to quit? Does\r\nthat worker receive in cash or kind his share of the gain in\r\nvalue during the period of his employment? If not, then the run-\r\nup in value during his period of employment will be gobbled up\r\nby his successor--a recipe for immense resentment. Yet that\r\ndanger can be ducked only by creating a capital structure that\r\ngives present employees separable interests in either debt or\r\nequity in exchange for their contributions to the company. But\r\nonce that is done, then the worker commune is converted into a\r\ntraditional company whose shareholders and creditors contain a\r\nlarge fraction of its present and former employers. The bottom\r\nline is that idealistic communes cannot last for the long\r\nhaul.10\r\n31\r\n\r\nThere are a number of ideas here. First, \"idealistic communes\r\ncannot last for the long haul.\" The skepticism about the staying\r\npower of idealism sounds plausible today, though there are some\r\nrelatively prominent counterexamples. The Catholic Church is\r\nalso a purportedly idealistic institution. It is based on\r\ncanonical texts that are subject to even more heated arguments\r\nabout textual interpretation than those which surround the\r\nGeneral Public License. It seems to be surviving the long haul\r\nquite well.\r\n32\r\n\r\nThe second reason for doomsaying is provided by the word\r\n\"commune.\" The problems Epstein describes are real where\r\ntangible property and excludable assets are involved. But is the\r\nfree and open source community a \"commune,\" holding tangible\r\nproperty in common and excluding the rest of us? Must it worry\r\nabout how to split up the proceeds if someone leaves because of\r\nbad karma? Or is it a community creating and offering to the\r\nworld the ability to use, for free, nonrival goods that all of\r\nus can have, use, and reinterpret as we wish? In that kind of\r\ncommune, each of us could take all the property the community\r\nhad created with us when we left and the commune would still be\r\nnone the poorer. Jefferson was not thinking of software when he\r\ntalked of the person who lights his taper from mine but does not\r\ndarken me, but the idea is the same one. Copying software is not\r\nlike fighting over who owns the scented candles or the VW bus.\r\nDoes the person who wrote the \"kernel\" of the operating system\r\nresent the person who, much later, writes the code to manage\r\nInternet Protocol addresses on a wireless network? Why should\r\nhe? Now the program does more cool stuff. Both of them can use\r\nit. What's to resent?\r\n33\r\n\r\nHow about idealism? There is indeed a broad debate on the\r\nreasons that the system works: Are the motivations those of the\r\ngift economy? Is it, as Shirky says, simply the flowering of an\r\ninnate love that human beings have always had for each other and\r\nfor sharing, now given new strength by the geographic reach and\r\ncooperative techniques the Internet provides? \"With love alone,\r\nyou can plan a birthday party. Add coordinating tools and you\r\ncan write an operating system.\" Is this actually a form of\r\npotlatch, in which one gains prestige by the extravagance of the\r\nresources one \"wastes\"? Is open source an implicit résumé-\r\nbuilder that pays off in other ways? Is it driven by the\r\nspecies-being, the innate human love of creation that\r\ncontinually drives us to create new things even when homo\r\neconomicus would be at home in bed, mumbling about public goods\r\nproblems?11\r\n34\r\n\r\nYochai Benkler and I would argue that these questions are fun to\r\ndebate but ultimately irrelevant.12 Assume a random distribution\r\nof incentive structures in different people, a global\r\nnetwork--transmission, information sharing, and copying costs\r\nthat approach zero--and a modular creation process. With these\r\nassumptions, it just does not matter why they do it. In lots of\r\ncases, they will do it. One person works for love of the\r\nspecies, another in the hope of a better job, a third for the\r\njoy of solving puzzles, and a fourth because he has to solve a\r\nparticular problem anyway for his own job and loses nothing by\r\nmaking his hack available for all. Each person has their own\r\nreserve price, the point at which they say, \"Now I will turn off\r\nSurvivor and go and create something.\" But on a global network,\r\nthere are a lot of people, and with numbers that big and\r\ninformation overhead that small, even relatively hard projects\r\nwill attract motivated and skilled people whose particular\r\nreserve price has been crossed.\r\n35\r\n\r\nMore conventionally, many people write free software because\r\nthey are paid to do so. Amazingly, IBM now earns more from what\r\nit calls \"Linux-related revenues\" than it does from traditional\r\npatent licensing, and IBM is the largest patent holder in the\r\nworld.13 It has decided that the availability of an open\r\nplatform, to which many firms and individuals contribute, will\r\nactually allow it to sell more of its services, and, for that\r\nmatter, its hardware. A large group of other companies seem to\r\nagree. They like the idea of basing their services, hardware,\r\nand added value on a widely adopted \"commons.\" This does not\r\nseem like a community in decline.\r\n36\r\n\r\nPeople used to say that collaborative creation could never\r\nproduce a quality product. That has been shown to be false. So\r\nnow they say that collaborative creation cannot be sustained\r\nbecause the governance mechanisms will not survive the success\r\nof the project. Professor Epstein conjures up a \"central\r\ncommittee\" from which insiders will be unable to cash out--a nice\r\nmixture of communist and capitalist metaphors. All governance\r\nsystems--including democracies and corporate boards--have\r\nproblems. But so far as we can tell, those who are influential\r\nin the free software and open source governance communities\r\n(there is, alas, no \"central committee\") feel that they are\r\ndoing very well indeed. In the last resort, when they disagree\r\nwith decisions that are taken, there is always the possibility\r\nof \"forking the code,\" introducing a change to the software that\r\nnot everyone agrees with, and then letting free choice and\r\nmarket selection converge on the preferred iteration. The free\r\nsoftware ecosystem also exhibits diversity. Systems based on\r\nGNU-Linux, for example, have distinct \"flavors\" with names like\r\nUbuntu, Debian, and Slackware, each with passionate adherents\r\nand each optimized for a particular concern--beauty, ease of use,\r\ntechnical manipulability. So far, the tradition of \"rough\r\nconsensus and running code\" seems to be proving itself\r\nempirically as a robust governance system.\r\n37\r\n\r\nWhy on earth should we care? People have come up with a\r\nsurprising way to create software. So what? There are at least\r\nthree reasons we might care. First, it teaches us something\r\nabout the limitations of conventional economics and the\r\ncounterintuitive business methods that thrive on networks.\r\nSecond, it might offer a new tool in our attempt to solve a\r\nvariety of social problems. Third, and most speculative, it\r\nhints at the way that a global communications network can\r\nsometimes help move the line between work and play, professional\r\nand amateur, individual and community creation, rote production\r\nand compensated \"hobby.\"\r\n38\r\n\r\nWe should pay attention to open source software because it shows\r\nus something about business methods in the digital world--indeed\r\nin the entire world of \"information-based\" products, which is\r\ncoming to include biotechnology. The scale of your network\r\nmatters. The larger the number of people who use your operating\r\nsystem, make programs for your type of computer, create new\r\nlevels for your game, or use your device, the better off you\r\nare. A single fax machine is a paperweight. Two make up a\r\ncommunications link. Ten million and you have a ubiquitous\r\ncommunications network into which your \"paperweight\" is now a\r\nhugely valuable doorway.\r\n39\r\n\r\nThis is the strange characteristic of networked goods. The\r\nactions of strangers dramatically increase or decrease the\r\nusefulness of your good. At each stage the decision of someone\r\nelse to buy a fax machine increases the value of mine. If I am\r\neating an apple, I am indifferent about whether you are too. But\r\nif I have a fax machine then my welfare is actually improved by\r\nthe decisions of strangers to buy one. The same process works in\r\nreverse. Buy a word processing program that becomes unpopular,\r\nget \"locked in\" to using it, and find yourself unable to\r\nexchange your work easily with others. Networks matter and\r\nincreasing the size of the networks continues to add benefits to\r\nthe individual members.\r\n40\r\n\r\nWhat's true for the users of networks is doubly so for the\r\nproducers of the goods that create them. From the perspective of\r\na producer of a good that shows strong network effects such as a\r\nword processing program or an operating system, the optimal\r\nposition is to be the company that owns and controls the\r\ndominant product on the market. The ownership and control is\r\nprobably by means of intellectual property rights, which are,\r\nafter all, the type of property rights one finds on networks.\r\nThe value of that property depends on those positive and\r\nnegative network effects. This is the reason Microsoft is worth\r\nso much money. The immense investment in time, familiarity,\r\nlegacy documents, and training that Windows or Word users have\r\nprovides a strong incentive not to change products. The fact\r\nthat other users are similarly constrained makes it difficult to\r\nmanage any change. Even if I change word processor formats and\r\ngo through the trouble to convert all my documents, I still need\r\nto exchange files with you, who are similarly constrained. From\r\na monopolist's point of view, the handcuffs of network effects\r\nare indeed golden, though opinions differ about whether or not\r\nthis is a cause for antitrust action.\r\n41\r\n\r\nBut if the position that yields the most revenue is that of a\r\nmonopolist exercising total control, the second-best position\r\nmay well be that of a company contributing to a large and widely\r\nused network based on open standards and, perhaps, open\r\nsoftware. The companies that contribute to open source do not\r\nhave the ability to exercise monopoly control, the right to\r\nextract every last cent of value from it. But they do have a\r\ndifferent advantage; they get the benefit of all the\r\ncontributions to the system without having to pay for them. The\r\nperson who improves an open source program may not work for IBM\r\nor Red Hat, but those companies benefit from her addition, just\r\nas she does from theirs. The system is designed to continue\r\ngrowing, adding more contributions back into the commons. The\r\nusers get the benefit of an ever-enlarging network, while the\r\nopenness of the material diminishes the lock-in effects. Lacking\r\nthe ability to extract payment for the network good itself--the\r\noperating system, say--the companies that participate typically\r\nget paid for providing tied goods and services, the value of\r\nwhich increases as the network does.\r\n42\r\n\r\nI write a column for the Financial Times, but I lack the fervor\r\nof the true enthusiast in the \"Great Game of Markets.\" By\r\nthemselves, counterintuitive business methods do not make my\r\nantennae tingle. But as Larry Lessig and Yochai Benkler have\r\nargued, this is something more than just another business\r\nmethod. They point us to the dramatic role that openness--whether\r\nin network architecture, software, or content--has had in the\r\nsuccess of the Internet. What is going on here is actually a\r\nremarkable corrective to the simplistic notion of the tragedy of\r\nthe commons, a corrective to the Internet Threat storyline and\r\nto the dynamics of the second enclosure movement. This commons\r\ncreates and sustains value, and allows firms and individuals to\r\nbenefit from it, without depleting the value already created. To\r\nappropriate a phrase from Carol Rose, open source teaches us\r\nabout the comedy of the commons, a way of arranging markets and\r\nproduction that we, with our experience rooted in physical\r\nproperty and its typical characteristics, at first find\r\ncounterintuitive and bizarre. Which brings us to the next\r\nquestion for open source. Can we use its techniques to solve\r\nproblems beyond the world of software production?\r\n43\r\n\r\nIn the language of computer programmers, the issue here is \"does\r\nit scale?\" Can we generalize anything from this limited example?\r\nHow many types of production, innovation, and research fit into\r\nthe model I have just described? After all, for many innovations\r\nand inventions one needs hardware, capital investment, and\r\nlarge-scale, real-world data collection--stuff, in its infinite\r\nrecalcitrance and facticity. Maybe the open source model\r\nprovides a workaround to the individual incentives problem, but\r\nthat is not the only problem. And how many types of innovation\r\nor cultural production are as modular as software? Is open\r\nsource software a paradigm case of collective innovation that\r\nhelps us to understand open source software and not much else?\r\n44\r\n\r\nAgain, I think this is a good question, but it may be the wrong\r\none. My own guess is that an open source method of production is\r\nfar more common than we realize. \"Even before the Internet\" (as\r\nsome of my students have taken to saying portentously), science,\r\nlaw, education, and musical genres all developed in ways that\r\nare markedly similar to the model I have described. The\r\nmarketplace of ideas, the continuous roiling development in\r\nthought and norms that our political culture spawns, owes much\r\nmore to the distributed, nonproprietary model than it does to\r\nthe special case of commodified innovation that we think about\r\nin copyright and patent. Not that copyright and patent are\r\nunimportant in the process, but they may well be the exception\r\nrather than the norm. Commons-based production of ideas is\r\nhardly unfamiliar, after all.\r\n45\r\n\r\nIn fact, all the mottos of free software development have their\r\ncounterparts in the theory of democracy and open society; \"given\r\nenough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow\" is merely the most\r\nobvious example. Karl Popper would have cheered.14 The\r\nimportance of open source software is not that it introduces us\r\nto a wholly new idea. It is that it makes us see clearly a very\r\nold idea. With open source the technology was novel, the\r\nproduction process transparent, and the result of that process\r\nwas a \"product\" which outcompeted other products in the\r\nmarketplace. \"How can this have happened? What about the tragedy\r\nof the commons?\" we asked in puzzlement, coming only slowly to\r\nthe realization that other examples of commons-based,\r\nnonproprietary production were all around us.\r\n46\r\n\r\nStill, this does not answer the question of whether the model\r\ncan scale still further, whether it can be applied to solve\r\nproblems in other spheres. To answer that question we would need\r\nto think more about the modularity of other types of inventions.\r\nHow much can they be broken down into chunks suitable for\r\ndistribution among a widespread community? Which forms of\r\ninnovation have some irreducible need for high capital\r\ninvestment in distinctly nonvirtual components--a particle\r\naccelerator or a Phase III drug trial? Again, my guess is that\r\nthe increasing migration of the sciences toward data- and\r\nprocessing-rich models makes much more of innovation and\r\ndiscovery a potential candidate for the distributed model.\r\nBioinformatics and computational biology, the open source\r\ngenomics project,15 the BioBricks Foundation I mentioned in the\r\nlast chapter, the possibility of distributed data scrutiny by\r\nlay volunteers16--all of these offer intriguing glances into the\r\npotential for the future. Finally, of course, the Internet is\r\none big experiment in, as Benkler puts it, peer-to-peer cultural\r\nproduction.17\r\n47\r\n\r\nIf these questions are good ones, why are they also the wrong\r\nones? I have given my guesses about the future of the\r\ndistributed model of innovation. My own utopia has it\r\nflourishing alongside a scaled-down, but still powerful,\r\nintellectual property regime. Equally plausible scenarios see it\r\nas a dead end or as the inevitable victor in the war of\r\nproductive processes. These are all guesses, however. At the\r\nvery least, there is some possibility, even hope, that we could\r\nhave a world in which much more of intellectual and inventive\r\nproduction is free. \" 'Free' as in 'free speech,' \" Richard\r\nStallman says, not \"free as in 'free beer.' \"18 But we could\r\nhope that much of it would be both free of centralized control\r\nand low- or no-cost. When the marginal cost of reproduction is\r\nzero, the marginal cost of transmission and storage approaches\r\nzero, the process of creation is additive, and much of the labor\r\ndoesn't charge, the world looks a little different.19 This is at\r\nleast a possible future, or part of a possible future, and one\r\nthat we should not foreclose without thinking twice. Yet that is\r\nwhat we are doing. The Database Protection Bills and Directives,\r\nwhich extend intellectual property rights to the layer of\r\nfacts;20 the efflorescence of software patents;21 the UCITA-led\r\nvalidation of shrinkwrap licenses that bind third parties;22 the\r\nDigital Millennium Copyright Act's anticircumvention\r\nprovisions23--the point of all of these developments is not\r\nmerely that they make the peer-to-peer model difficult, but that\r\nin many cases they rule it out altogether. I will assert this\r\npoint here, rather than argue for it, but I think it can be (and\r\nhas been) demonstrated quite convincingly.24\r\n48\r\n\r\nThe point is, then, that there is a chance that a new (or old,\r\nbut underrecognized) method of production could flourish in ways\r\nthat seem truly valuable--valuable to free speech, innovation,\r\nscientific discovery, the wallets of consumers, to what William\r\nFisher calls \"semiotic democracy,\"25 and, perhaps, valuable to\r\nthe balance between joyful creation and drudgery for hire. True,\r\nit is only a chance. True, this theory's scope of operation and\r\nsustainability are uncertain. But why would we want to foreclose\r\nit? That is what the recent expansions of intellectual property\r\nthreaten to do. And remember, these expansions were dubious even\r\nin a world where we saw little or no possibility of the\r\ndistributed production model I have described, where discussion\r\nof network effects had yet to reach the pages of The New\r\nYorker,26 and where our concerns about the excesses of\r\nintellectual property were simply the ones that Jefferson,\r\nMadison, and Macaulay gave us so long ago.\r\n49\r\n\r\nLEARNING FROM THE\r\nSHARING ECONOMY\r\n50\r\n\r\nAccept for the sake of argument that the free software community\r\nactually works, actually produces high-quality products capable\r\nof competing in the market with proprietary alternatives.\r\nConcede for a moment that the adoption of Creative Commons\r\nlicenses shows there are millions of creators out there who want\r\nto share their works with others. Many of those creators even\r\nwant to allow the world to build on their material. Indeed, let\r\nus concede that the whole history of the Web, from Wikipedia to\r\nthe obsessive and usefully detailed sites created on everything\r\nfrom Vikings to shoe polishes, shows a desire to share one's\r\nknowledge, to build on the work of others one has never met.\r\nThese efforts are remarkably varied. Some are ultimately aimed\r\nat profit--even if their results are free. Think of IBM's open\r\nsource initiatives or musicians who release Creative Commons-\r\nlicensed work in order to get more club gigs. Some are provided\r\nas a volunteer act of benevolence or civic duty, even if they\r\n\"compete\" with expensive proprietary alternatives. Think of\r\nWikipedia or MIT's OpenCourseWare. When the infrastructure for\r\nthis collaboration does not exist, it gets assembled--and\r\nquickly. Both the GPL and Creative Commons are examples. Accept\r\nall of this. So what?\r\n51\r\n\r\nLesson number one comes from the nonprofit activities--everything\r\nfrom Wikipedia to Web sites created by enthusiasts. People like\r\nto create and wish to share. In many cases they will do so\r\nwithout financial reward. A surprising amount of useful,\r\ncreative, or expressive activity is generated without any\r\nfinancial incentive at all.\r\n52\r\n\r\nShould this cause us to throw out the economic case for\r\ncopyrights? No. But it should lead us to reassess it. As I\r\nexplained in Chapter 1, copyright provides an incentive for two\r\ndistinct activities. First, it offers an incentive to create the\r\nwork in the first place. The author of Windows for Dummies or\r\nHarry Potter gets a right to exclude others from copying the\r\nwork, a right that he or she can sell in the marketplace. The\r\ngoal is to offer a financial reason to devote time to this\r\nparticular creative activity. It is this incentive that is most\r\noften cited when attempting to persuade policy makers to expand\r\nprotection. Second, it offers an incentive to distribute the\r\nwork--to typeset and print large quantities of the work and to\r\nsell it to bookstores, or to broadcast it, or put it on movie\r\nscreens.\r\n53\r\n\r\nEach medium is economically different, of course. The economics\r\nof the feature film are different from those of the book, the\r\nmagazine, or the operating system. Thus, we have never had very\r\ngood figures on the relative importance of these incentives. We\r\ncan only guess at how much of the incentive from copyright goes\r\nto encouraging creation and how much to distribution. Until\r\nrecently, most types of distribution demanded higher levels of\r\ncapital. The industry structure that resulted often consisted of\r\ncreators who worked as wage or contract labor for\r\ndistributors--either never acquiring copyright in their work in\r\nthe first place or immediately transferring that copyright to\r\ntheir employers. Because distribution was expensive, our\r\nexperience with material generated for fun or out of a love of\r\nsharing was an essentially private and local one. You might have\r\na neighbor's photocopied sheet of baking recipes that worked\r\nwell at high altitudes, or of fishing techniques that worked\r\nwell on a particular lake, a song that a friend created for a\r\nspecial occasion, or a short story you wrote for your kids--and\r\nthen typed up for them to tell to theirs. Financial incentives\r\nwere not needed to encourage the creation of the work, but the\r\ncost of distribution dramatically limited its dissemination.\r\n54\r\n\r\nThe single most dramatic thing that the Web has done by lowering\r\nthe cost of communication and distribution, at the same moment\r\nthat other electronic tools lowered the cost of production, is\r\nto make this local and private activity a global and public one.\r\nSomeone, somewhere, will have written the guide to fishing on\r\nthat lake, baking at that altitude, washing windows, or treating\r\nstings from Portuguese man-of-war jellyfish. Someone will have\r\ntaken a photo of the Duke Chapel or explained the history,\r\neconomics, and chemistry of shoe polish or distilling. Someone\r\nmight even have created a great class on music theory or\r\nC???programming. Someone will have written a handy little\r\nprogram to manage DNS requests on a local network. Bizarrely, at\r\nleast as far as the economists were concerned, these people all\r\nwanted to share what they had made. Because of the genius of\r\nsearch engines, and the implicit peer-review function that those\r\nengines deduce from patterns of links to pages, I can find that\r\nmaterial when I need it.\r\n55\r\n\r\nTrue, much of the material on the Web is inane or insane,\r\nconfused, badly written, tendentious, and inaccurate. (It should\r\nbe noted that this is hardly a problem confined to the Web or\r\nvolunteer-generated material. Personally, I would not want\r\nPeople magazine or Fox News in a time capsule to represent my\r\ncivilization. But some of the material on the Web is clearly\r\nworse.) Yes, Wikipedia is occasionally inaccurate--though in one\r\ntest in Nature it stacked up well against the Encyclopedia\r\nBritannica, and it is obviously much more encyclopedic in its\r\ncoverage. But all of this misses the point.\r\n56\r\n\r\nConsider how your expectations about information retrieval have\r\nchanged in the last fifteen years. We now simply assume that\r\nquestions about a piece of architecture, a bit of local history,\r\na recipe, or the true author of a song can all be answered\r\nwithin seconds. We have forgotten what it is like to be\r\nroutinely in ignorance because of the unavailability of some\r\npiece of information. One podcaster I talked to called it being\r\na member of \"the right-click generation\": \"When I am walking\r\naround and I see a building, I almost feel as though I ought to\r\nbe able to 'right click' it and have the architect's name pop\r\nup.\" Consider that it now seems normal for a gay Iraqi man in\r\nBaghdad to have a blog that offers hundreds of thousands of\r\nreaders around the world a literate and touching account of the\r\nAmerican occupation from a perspective entirely different from\r\nthat provided by the mainstream press.27 We think it normal for\r\na person of moderate resources to be able to speak to the world\r\nfrom a war zone, whether or not he is affiliated with a\r\nnewspaper or credentialed by a corporation.\r\n57\r\n\r\nThese examples are not the end of the process. Our methods of\r\nsorting, ranking, and verifying the material generated are still\r\nevolving. They may improve even beyond this point. We are only\r\nfifteen years into this particular experiment, after all. And a\r\nhuge amount of this material is produced by our fellow citizens\r\nwithout the profit motive.\r\n58\r\n\r\nDoes this mean that we no longer need copyright or patent\r\nprotection to encourage the production and distribution of\r\ncreative work? No. The fishing tips are great, but I still might\r\nbuy a handsomely illustrated guide to take on the lake with me\r\nor, even better, just stay at home and read A River Runs Through\r\nIt. The New Yorker, and not a sheaf of printouts from the Web,\r\nstill sits on my coffee table, though much of the high-quality\r\ncontent I read comes to me online, for free, from strangers who\r\nare generating it for pleasure, not profit, or who profit from\r\nopen sharing, not closed control. The online blogosphere\r\nprovides a vital counterpoint to mainstream media, but it exists\r\nin a symbiotic--some would say parasitic--relationship with that\r\nmedia and the network of professional news gatherers for which\r\nit pays. Some of the most interesting open source production\r\nmethods actually rely on copyright. Even if they did not, open\r\nsource production would not suffice to run our pharmaceutical\r\nindustry (though it might help with certain stages of the drug\r\ndiscovery process).\r\n59\r\n\r\nStill, just as it would be silly to dismiss the importance of\r\nintellectual property based on our experience of blogs and\r\nWikipedia and open source software, it would be equally silly to\r\nunderestimate what the Web has taught us. The Web has enabled an\r\nastonishing flowering of communication and expression, an\r\nastounding democratization of creativity. We have learned just\r\nhow strong, and how useful, is the human urge to express,\r\ncommunicate, invent, and create--provided the barriers to sharing\r\nare lowered. These are the very things that copyright and patent\r\nare supposed to encourage. For us to portray the Web--as the\r\nInternet Threat story line does--as predominantly a threat to\r\ncreativity is simply perverse. For us to base our policies only\r\non that notion would be a tragedy. We might end up stultifying\r\none of the greatest explosions of human creativity the world has\r\never seen by treating it as an unimportant marginal case and\r\ninstead designing our rules around the production processes of\r\ncommercial culture in the late twentieth century.\r\n60\r\n\r\nThe shape of our copyright and to a lesser extent our patent\r\nsystem comes from a world in which almost all large-scale\r\ndistribution was an expensive, capital-intensive enterprise. The\r\nroles of gatekeeper and financier, producer and assembler,\r\ndistributor and advertiser, tended naturally to coalesce into\r\nvertically integrated firms or symbiotic commercial\r\npartnerships. Those firms were presumed to be the proxy for the\r\npublic interest when it came to intellectual property policy.\r\nWho would know better than they what was needed? Occasionally,\r\ndevice manufacturers would provide a counterweight--as in the\r\nSony case--where the defense of a particular \"consumer freedom\"\r\nactually created a market for a complementary product. Artists\r\nand authors might be trotted out as appealing spokespersons,\r\nthough the laws that were made only sporadically reflected their\r\neconomic and artistic interests. Librarians and educational\r\ninstitutions had influence at the edges. Most of the time,\r\nthough, it was the assemblers and distributors of content whose\r\nvoices and assumptions about markets would be heard.\r\n61\r\n\r\nOut of this pattern of habit and influence, and out of much\r\ndeeper notions about authorship and invention that I have\r\nexplored elsewhere, developed an ideology, a worldview. Call it\r\nmaximalism. Its proponents sincerely believed in it and pursued\r\nit even when it did not make economic sense. (Think how lucky\r\nthe movie industry is that it lost the Sony case.) It has been\r\nthe subject of this book. Its tenets are that intellectual\r\nproperty is just like physical property, that rights need to\r\nincrease proportionately as copying costs decrease, and that, in\r\ngeneral, increasing levels of intellectual property protection\r\nwill yield increasing levels of innovation. Despite its defense\r\nof ever-increasing government-granted monopolies, this ideology\r\ncloaks itself in the rhetoric of free markets. The bumbling\r\nstate, whose interventions in the economy normally spell\r\ndisaster, turns into a scalpel-wielding genius when its\r\nmonopolies and subsidies are provided through intellectual\r\nproperty rights rather than regulatory fiat. Above all, this way\r\nof seeing the world minimizes the importance of creativity,\r\nexpression, and distribution that takes place outside its\r\nframework and ignores or plays down the importance of the input\r\nside of the equation--the need to focus on the material from\r\nwhich culture and science are made, as well as the protected\r\nexpression and inventions made from that raw material.\r\n62\r\n\r\nThis process was not--let me stress--was not a simple process of\r\neconomic determinism or industry conspiracy. Anyone who claims\r\nthat is the thesis of this book simply has not read it.\r\n(Reviewers beware.) Let us start with economic determinism. It\r\nwas not a situation in which the law mechanistically recorded\r\nthe interests of the most economically important industries in\r\nthe area. This was the creation of a worldview, not the steely-\r\neyed calculation of profit and loss. Not only did many of the\r\nrules we ended up with make no sense from the point of view of\r\nsome of the largest economic players in the area--think of the\r\ndevice manufacturers, the search engines, and so on--they\r\nfrequently made no sense from the perspective of those proposing\r\nthem. Attempting to twist the law to make it illegal for\r\ntechnology to interfere with your old business method is\r\nfrequently bad for the industry seeking the protection, as well\r\nas for the technology, the market, and the wider society. Since\r\nthis worldview makes incumbents systematically blind to profit-\r\nmaking opportunities that could be secured by greater openness,\r\nrather than greater control, it actually disables them from\r\npursuing some of the most promising methods by which they could\r\nhave made money for their shareholders. Again, the chapter on\r\nthe Sony decision offers a salutary example.\r\n63\r\n\r\nEconomic determinism does not explain the rules we have. Neither\r\nare those rules simply a result of the manipulation of elected\r\nofficials by incumbent industries through crafty campaign\r\ncontributions and distorted evidence (though to be sure, there\r\nwas a lot of that as well). Many of the people who put forward\r\nthis worldview--both lobbyists and lobbied--sincerely believe that\r\nmore rights will always lead to more innovation, that all\r\nproperty rights are the same, that we do not need to think about\r\nboth the input and output sides of the equation, that cheaper\r\ncopying techniques automatically require greater protections,\r\nand so on.\r\n64\r\n\r\nWhat of the modest suggestions I put forward here? We could sum\r\nthem up thus: do not apply identical assumptions to physical and\r\nintellectual property. Focus on both the inputs to and the\r\noutputs of the creative process; protecting the latter may\r\nincrease the cost of the former. Look both at the role of the\r\npublic domain and the commons of cultural and scientific\r\nmaterial and at the need to provide incentives for creativity\r\nand distribution through exclusive rights. More rights will not\r\nautomatically produce more innovation. Indeed, we should confine\r\nrights as narrowly as possible while still providing the desired\r\nresult. Look at the empirical evidence before and after\r\nincreasing the level of protection. Pay attention to the\r\nbenefits as well as the costs of the new technologies and the\r\nflowering of creativity they enable.\r\n65\r\n\r\nTo me, these points seem bland, boring, obvious--verging on\r\ntautology or pablum. To many believers in the worldview I have\r\ndescribed, they are either straightforward heresy or a\r\nsmokescreen for some real, underlying agenda--which is identified\r\nas communism, anarchism, or, somewhat confusingly, both.\r\n66\r\n\r\nThis account smacks of exaggeration, I know. How could things be\r\nso one-sided? The best answer I can give came from a question I\r\nwas asked at a recent conference. The questioner pointed out\r\npolitely that it was unlikely that the policy-making process\r\nwould ignore such a fundamental and obvious set of points--points\r\nthat I myself observed had been well understood for hundreds of\r\nyears. I had used many examples of intellectual property rights\r\nbeing extended--in length, breadth, scope. Why had I not spoken,\r\nhe asked, of all the times over the last fifty years when\r\nintellectual property rights had been weakened, curtailed,\r\nshortened? Since human beings were fallible, surely there were\r\noccasions when the length of a copyright or patent term had\r\nproved to be too long, or the scope of a right too large, and\r\nthe rights had been narrowed appropriately by legislation. Why\r\ndid I not cite any of these? The answer is simple. To the best\r\nof my knowledge, there are none. Legislatively, intellectual\r\nproperty rights have moved only in one direction--outward. (Court\r\ndecisions present a more complex picture, as the previous\r\nchapter's discussion of software copyrights and business method\r\npatents shows.)\r\n67\r\n\r\nWhat are the odds that the costs of new technologies are always\r\ngreater than their benefits as far as intellectual property\r\nrights holders are concerned? This pattern is not a matter of\r\npolicies carefully crafted around the evidence. It is the fossil\r\nrecord of fifty years of maximalism. If I lean toward the other\r\nside of the story it is not because I am a foe of intellectual\r\nproperty. It is because I believe our policies have become\r\nfundamentally unbalanced--unbalanced in ways that actually blind\r\nus to what is going on in the world of creativity.\r\n68\r\n\r\nWe are living through an existence-proof that there are other\r\nmethods of generating innovation, expression, and creativity\r\nthan the proprietary, exclusionary model of sole control. True,\r\nthese methods existed before. Yet they tended to be local or\r\ninvisible or both. The Internet has shown conclusively and\r\nvisibly that--at least in certain sectors--we can have a global\r\nflowering of creativity, innovation, and information sharing in\r\nwhich intellectual property rights function in a very different\r\nway than under the standard model of proprietary control. In\r\nsome cases, intellectual property rights were simply\r\nirrelevant--much of the information sharing and indexing on the\r\nWeb falls within this category. In some cases they were used to\r\nprevent exclusivity. Think of Creative Commons or the General\r\nPublic License. In some, they were actually impediments.\r\nSoftware patents, for example, have a negative effect on open\r\nsource software development--one that policy makers are only now\r\nslowly beginning to acknowledge.\r\n69\r\n\r\nIt is important not to overstate how far the sharing economy can\r\nget us. It might help to cut the costs of early-stage drug\r\ndevelopment, as the Tropical Disease Initiative attempts to do\r\nfor neglected diseases. It will not generate a Phase III drug\r\ntrial or bring a drug to market. Sharing methods might be used\r\nto generate cult movies such as Star Wreck: In the Pirkinning,\r\nwhich was created using techniques borrowed from open source\r\nsoftware and is available under a Creative Commons license. They\r\nwill not produce a mammoth blockbuster like Ben Hur, or\r\nWaterworld for that matter--results that will generate mixed\r\nfeelings. So there are real limitations to the processes I\r\ndescribe.\r\n70\r\n\r\nBut even acknowledging those limitations, it is fair to say that\r\none of the most striking events to occur during our lifetimes is\r\nthe transformation wrought by the Web, a transformation that is\r\npartly driven by the extraordinary explosion of nonproprietary\r\ncreativity and sharing across digital networks. The cultural\r\nexpectation that a web of expression and information will just\r\nbe there--whatever subject we are discussing--is a fundamental\r\none, the one that in some sense separates us from our children.\r\nWith this as a background it is both bizarre and perverse that\r\nwe choose to concentrate our policy making only on maintaining\r\nthe business methods of the last century, only on the story line\r\nof the Internet Threat, only on the dangers that the technology\r\nposes to creativity (and it does pose some) and never on the\r\nbenefits.\r\n71\r\n\r\nWhat would it mean to pay attention to the changes I have\r\ndescribed? It would mean assessing the impact of rules on both\r\nproprietary and nonproprietary production. For example, if the\r\nintroduction of a broad regime of software patents would render\r\nopen source software development more difficult (because\r\nindividual contributors cannot afford to do a patent search on\r\nevery piece of code they contribute), then this should be\r\nreflected as a cost of software patents, to be balanced against\r\nwhatever benefits the system brought. A method for encouraging\r\ninnovation might, in fact, inhibit one form of it.\r\n72\r\n\r\nPaying attention to the last ten years means we need to realize\r\nthat nonproprietary, distributed production is not the poor\r\nrelation of traditional proprietary, hierarchically organized\r\nproduction. This is no hippy lovefest. It is the business method\r\non which IBM has staked billions of dollars; the method of\r\ncultural production that generates much of the information each\r\nof us uses every day. It is just as deserving of respect and the\r\nsolicitude of policy makers as the more familiar methods pursued\r\nby the film studios and proprietary software companies. Losses\r\ndue to sharing that failed because of artificially erected legal\r\nbarriers are every bit as real as losses that come about because\r\nof illicit copying. Yet our attention goes entirely to the\r\nlatter.\r\n73\r\n\r\nThe main thrust of the argument here is still firmly within the\r\nJeffersonian, Scottish Enlightenment tradition. Jefferson does\r\nnot wish to give the patent to Oliver Evans because he believes\r\nthe invention will be (and has been) generated anyway without\r\nthe granting of an intellectual property right and that there\r\nare sufficient information retrieval methods to have practical\r\naccess to it. In this case, the information retrieval method is\r\nnot Google. It is a polymath genius combing his library in\r\nMonticello for references to Persian irrigation methods. The\r\n\"embarrassment\" caused by the unnecessary patent is added\r\nexpense and bureaucracy in agriculture and impediments to\r\nfurther innovators, not the undermining of open source software.\r\nBut it is the same principle of cautious minimalism, the same\r\nbelief that much innovation goes on without proprietary control\r\nand that intellectual property rights are the exception, not the\r\nrule. When Benjamin Franklin, a man who surely deserved patents\r\nunder even the most stringent set of tests, chooses to forgo\r\nthem because he has secured so much benefit from the\r\ncontributions of others, he expresses Shirky's norm nicely.\r\n74\r\n\r\nIndeed, Jefferson's optimism depends partly on a view of\r\ninformation sharing that captures beautifully the attitudes of\r\nthe generation that built the Web. The letter that I discussed\r\nin Chapter 2 was widely cited for precisely this reason.\r\nRemember these lines?\r\n75\r\n\r\n    That ideas should freely spread from one to another over the\r\nglobe, for the moral and mutual instruction of man, and\r\nimprovement of his condition, seems to have been peculiarly and\r\nbenevolently designed by nature, when she made them, like fire,\r\nexpansible over all space, without lessening their density in\r\nany point, and like the air in which we breathe, move, and have\r\nour physical being, incapable of confinement or exclusive\r\nappropriation.\r\n76\r\n\r\nWhat could encapsulate better the process by which information\r\nspreads on a global network? What could more elegantly state the\r\nnorms of the \"information wants to be free\" generation? (Though\r\nthose who quoted him conveniently omitted the portions of his\r\nanalysis where he concedes that there are cases where\r\nintellectual property rights may be necessary and desirable.)\r\n77\r\n\r\nIn some ways, then, the explosion of nonproprietary and, in many\r\ncases, noncommercial creativity and information sharing is\r\nsimply the vindication of Jefferson's comparison of ideas with\r\n\"fire . . . expansible over all space.\" The Web makes the simile\r\na reality and puts an exclamation point at the end of the\r\nJefferson Warning. All the more reason to pay attention to it.\r\nBut the creative commons I described here goes further. It\r\nforces us to reconceptualize a form of life, a method of\r\nproduction, and a means of social organization that we used to\r\nrelegate to the private world of informal sharing and\r\ncollaboration. Denied a commons by bad intellectual property\r\nrules, we can sometimes build our own--which may in some ways do\r\neven more for us than the zone of free trade, free thought, and\r\nfree action that Jefferson wished to protect.\r\n78\r\n\r\nDoes all this mean that the Jefferson Warning is no longer\r\nnecessary? Can we mitigate the negative effects of intellectual\r\nproperty expansion through a series of privately constructed\r\ncommons? The answers to those questions are, respectively, \"no\"\r\nand \"sometimes.\" Think of the story of retrospectively extended\r\ncopyright and orphan works. In many cases the problem with our\r\nintellectual property rights is that they create barriers to\r\nsharing--without producing an incentive in return--in ways that\r\ncan never be solved through private agreement. Twentieth century\r\nculture will largely remain off-limits for digitization,\r\nreproduction, adaptation, and translation. No series of private\r\ncontracts or licenses can fix the problem because the relevant\r\nparties are not in the room and might not agree if they were.\r\n79\r\n\r\nEven when the parties are available and agree to share, the\r\nbenefits may not flow to all equally. Beset by a multitude of\r\nvague patents of questionable worth and uncertain scope, large\r\ninformation technology firms routinely create patent pools. IBM\r\ntosses in thousands of patents, so does Hewlett or Dell. Each\r\nagrees not to sue the other. This is great for the established\r\ncompanies; they can proceed without fear of legal action from\r\nthe landmine patents that litter the technological landscape. As\r\nfar as the participants are concerned, the patent pool is almost\r\nlike the public domain--but a privatized public domain, a park\r\nthat only residents may enter. But what about the start up\r\ncompany that does not have the thousands of patents necessary\r\nfor entry? They are not in as happy a situation. The patent pool\r\nfixes the problem of poor patent quality and unclear scope--one\r\nthat Jefferson was worrying about 200 years ago. But it fixes it\r\nonly for the dominant firms, hurting competition in the process.\r\n80\r\n\r\nAttempts to form a commons may also backfire. The coordination\r\nproblems are legion. There are difficulties of compatibility in\r\nlicenses and the process, no matter how easy, still imposes\r\ntransaction costs. Nevertheless, with all of these\r\nqualifications, the idea of the privately created commons is an\r\nimportant addition to the world view that Jefferson provided, a\r\nnew tool in our attempt to craft a working system of innovation\r\nand culture. No one who looks at the Web can doubt the power of\r\ndistributed, and frequently uncompensated, creativity in\r\nconstructing remarkable reference works, operating systems,\r\ncultural conversations, even libraries of images and music. Some\r\nof that innovation happens largely outside of the world of\r\nintellectual property. Some of it happens in privately created\r\nareas of sharing that use property rights and open, sometimes\r\neven machine-readable, licenses to create a commons on which\r\nothers can build. The world of creativity and its methods is\r\nwider than we had thought. That is one of the vital and exciting\r\nlessons the Internet teaches us; unfortunately, the only one our\r\npolicy makers seem to hear is \"cheaper copying means more\r\npiracy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 9: An Evidence-Free Zone\r\n1\r\n\r\nPerhaps some of the arguments in this book have convinced you.\r\nPerhaps it is a mistake to think of intellectual property in the\r\nsame way we think of physical property. Perhaps limitations and\r\nexceptions to those rights are as important as the rights\r\nthemselves. Perhaps the public domain has a vital and tragically\r\nneglected role to play in innovation and culture. Perhaps\r\nrelentlessly expanding property rights will not automatically\r\nbring us increased innovation in science and culture. Perhaps\r\nthe second enclosure movement is more troubling than the first.\r\nPerhaps it is unwise to extend copyright again and again, and to\r\ndo so retrospectively, locking up most of twentieth-century\r\nculture in order to protect the tiny fragment of it that is\r\nstill commercially available. Perhaps technological improvements\r\nbring both benefits and costs to existing rights holders--both of\r\nwhich should be considered when setting policy. Perhaps we need\r\na vigorous set of internal limitations and exceptions within\r\ncopyright, or control over content will inevitably become\r\ncontrol over the medium of transmission. Perhaps the Internet\r\nshould make us think seriously about the power of nonproprietary\r\nand distributed production.\r\n2\r\n\r\nSaying all this gives us some guidance in how we should think.\r\nIt points out certain patterns of error. But its prescriptions\r\nare not simple. Precisely because it is not a rejection of\r\nintellectual property rights, but rather a claim that they only\r\nwork well through a process of consciously balancing openness\r\nand control, public domain and private right, it still leaves\r\nopen the question of where that point of balance is and how to\r\nstrike it.\r\n3\r\n\r\nIn this chapter I want to offer a suggestion that in any other\r\nfield would be stunningly obvious, boring even, but in the\r\nfunhouse mirror of intellectual property appears revolutionary.\r\nWe should make our policy based on empirical evidence of its\r\nlikely effects and there should be a formal requirement of\r\nempirical reconsideration of those policies after they have been\r\nimplemented to see if they are working. Why is this a good idea?\r\n4\r\n\r\nImagine a process of reviewing prescription drugs that goes like\r\nthis: representatives from the drug company come to the\r\nregulators and argue that their drug works well and should be\r\napproved. They have no evidence of this beyond a few anecdotes\r\nabout people who want to take it and perhaps some very simple\r\nmodels of how the drug might affect the human body. The drug is\r\napproved. No trials, no empirical evidence of any kind, no\r\nfollow-up. Or imagine a process of making environmental\r\nregulations in which there were no data, and no attempts to\r\ngather data, about the effects of the particular pollutants\r\nbeing studied. Even the harshest critics of regulation would\r\nadmit we generally do better than this. But this is often the\r\nway we make intellectual property policy.\r\n5\r\n\r\nSo how do we decide the ground rules of the information age?\r\nRepresentatives of interested industries come to regulators and\r\nask for another heaping slice of monopoly rent in the form of an\r\nintellectual property right. They have doom-laden predictions,\r\nthey have anecdotes, carefully selected to pluck the\r\nheartstrings of legislators, they have celebrities who\r\ntestify--often incoherently, but with palpable charisma--and they\r\nhave very, very simple economic models. The basic economic model\r\nhere is \"If you give me a larger right, I will have a larger\r\nincentive to innovate. Thus the bigger the rights, the more\r\ninnovation we will get. Right?\"\r\n6\r\n\r\nAs I have tried to show here using the words of Jefferson and\r\nMacaulay and examples such as term extension, software\r\ncopyrights, and garage door openers, this logic is fallacious.\r\nEven without data, the \"more is better\" idea is obviously\r\nflawed. Copyrighting the alphabet will not produce more books.\r\nPatenting E=?mc2 will not yield more scientific innovation.\r\nIntellectual property creates barriers to, as well as incentives\r\ntoward, innovation. Jefferson agonized over the issue of when\r\nthe benefits exceed the costs of a new right. \"I know well the\r\ndifficulty of drawing a line between the things which are worth\r\nto the public the embarrassment of an exclusive patent, and\r\nthose which are not.\" It is not clear that contemporary policy\r\nmakers approach issues with anything like the same\r\nsophistication or humility. But it would be an equal mistake to\r\nconclude, as some do, that expansions of intellectual property\r\nare never justified. Extensions of rights can help or hurt, but\r\nwithout economic evidence beforehand and review afterward, we\r\nwill never know. This point should be obvious, banal, even\r\ndeeply boring, but sadly it is not.\r\n7\r\n\r\nFrom Jefferson and Macaulay and Adam Smith, I derived a second\r\npoint. In the absence of evidence on either side, the\r\npresumption should be against creating a new, legalized\r\nmonopoly. The burden of proof should lie on those who claim, in\r\nany particular case, that the state should step in to stop\r\ncompetition, outlaw copying, proscribe technology, or restrict\r\nspeech. They have to show us that the existing protection is not\r\nenough. But this presumption is a second-best solution and the\r\nempirical emptiness of the debates frustrating.\r\n8\r\n\r\nThis makes an occasion where there is some evidence a time for\r\ncelebration. What we need is a test case in which one country\r\nadopts the proposed new intellectual property right and another\r\nsimilarly situated country does not, and we can assess how they\r\nare both doing after a number of years.\r\n9\r\n\r\nThere is such a case. It is the \"database right.\"\r\n10\r\n\r\nOWNING FACTS?\r\n11\r\n\r\nEurope adopted a Database Directive in 1996 which gave a high\r\nlevel of copyright protection to databases and conferred a new\r\n\"sui generis\" database right even on unoriginal compilations of\r\nfacts. In the United States, by contrast, in a 1991 case called\r\nFeist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., 499\r\nU.S. 340 (1991), the Supreme Court made it clear that unoriginal\r\ncompilations of facts are not copyrightable.\r\n12\r\n\r\nWhat does all this mean? Take the phone directory--that was the\r\nproduct at issue in the Feist case. A white pages directory is a\r\ndatabase of names and numbers, compiled in alphabetical order by\r\nname. Does anyone have an intellectual property right over it?\r\nNot the particular dog-eared directory lying next to your phone.\r\nDoes the phone company that compiled it own the facts, the\r\nnumbers inside that directory? Could they forbid me from copying\r\nthem, adding others from surrounding areas, and issuing a\r\ncompeting directory that I believed consumers would find more\r\nvaluable? This was an important issue for Feist because it went\r\nto the heart of their business. They issued regional telephone\r\ndirectories, combining records from multiple phone companies. In\r\nthis case, all the other companies in the region agreed to\r\nlicense their data to Feist. Rural did not, so Feist copied the\r\ninformation, checked as many entries as possible, adding\r\naddresses to some of the listings, and published the combined\r\nresult. Rural sued and lost. The Supreme Court declared that\r\nmere alphabetical listings and other unoriginal assemblies of\r\ndata cannot be copyrighted.\r\n13\r\n\r\n    It may seem unfair that much of the fruit of the compiler's\r\nlabor may be used by others without compensation. As Justice\r\nBrennan has correctly observed, however, this is not \"some\r\nunforeseen byproduct of a statutory scheme.\" It is, rather, \"the\r\nessence of copyright,\" and a constitutional requirement. The\r\nprimary objective of copyright is not to reward the labor of\r\nauthors, but \"to promote the Progress of Science and useful\r\nArts.\" To this end, copyright assures authors the right to their\r\noriginal expression, but encourages others to build freely upon\r\nthe ideas and information conveyed by a work. This principle,\r\nknown as the idea/expression or fact/expression dichotomy,\r\napplies to all works of authorship. As applied to a factual\r\ncompilation, assuming the absence of original written\r\nexpression, only the compiler's selection and arrangement may be\r\nprotected; the raw facts may be copied at will. This result is\r\nneither unfair nor unfortunate. It is the means by which\r\ncopyright advances the progress of science and art.1\r\n14\r\n\r\nFeist was not as revolutionary as some critics claimed it to be.\r\nMost of the appeals courts in the United States had long held\r\nthis to be the case. As the Court pointed out in the passage\r\nabove, it is a fundamental tenet of the U.S. intellectual\r\nproperty system that neither facts nor ideas can be owned. Feist\r\nmerely reiterated that point clearly and stressed that it was\r\nnot just a policy choice, it was a constitutional requirement--a\r\nlimit imposed by the Constitution's grant of power to Congress\r\nto make copyright and patent laws.\r\n15\r\n\r\nDaily politics cares little for the limitations imposed by\r\nconstitutions or for the structural principle the Court\r\ndescribes--that we should leave facts free for others to build\r\nupon. Since 1991, a few database companies have lobbied the\r\nCongress strenuously and continuously to create a special\r\ndatabase right over facts. Interestingly, apart from academics,\r\nscientists, and civil libertarians, many database companies, and\r\neven those well-known property haters, the U.S. Chamber of\r\nCommerce, oppose the creation of such a right. They believe that\r\ndatabase providers can adequately protect themselves with\r\ncontracts or technical means such as passwords, can rely on\r\nproviding tied services, and so on. Moreover, they argue that\r\nstrong database protection may make it harder to generate\r\ndatabases in the first place; the facts you need may be locked\r\nup. We need to focus on the inputs as well as the outputs of the\r\nprocess--a point I have tried to make throughout this book. The\r\npressure to create a new right continues, however, aided by\r\ncries that the United States must \"harmonize\" with Europe,\r\nwhere, you will remember, compilations of facts are strongly\r\nprotected by intellectual property rights, even if their\r\narrangement is unoriginal.\r\n16\r\n\r\nSo here we have our natural experiment. One major economy\r\nrejects such protection and resists pressure to create a new\r\nright. A different major economic region, at a comparable level\r\nof development, institutes the right with the explicit claim\r\nthat it will help to produce new databases and make that segment\r\nof the economy more competitive. Presumably government\r\neconomists in the United States and the European Union have been\r\nhard at work ever since, seeing if the right actually worked?\r\nWell, not exactly.\r\n17\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that the European Commission has a legal\r\nobligation to review the Database Directive for its effects on\r\ncompetition, it was more than three years late issuing its\r\nreport. At first, during the review process, no attention was\r\npaid to the actual evidence of whether the Directive helps or\r\nhurts the European Union, or whether the database industry in\r\nthe United States has collapsed or flourished. That is a shame,\r\nbecause the evidence was there and it was fairly shocking. Yet\r\nfinally, at the end of the process, the Commission did turn to\r\nthe evidence, as I will recount, and came to a remarkable\r\nconclusion--which was promptly stifled for political reasons. But\r\nwe are getting ahead of ourselves.\r\n18\r\n\r\nHow do we frame the empirical inquiry? Intellectual property\r\nrights allow the creation of state-backed monopolies, and \"the\r\ngeneral tendency of monopolies,\" as Macaulay pointed out, is \"to\r\nmake articles scarce, to make them dear, and to make them bad.\"\r\nMonopolies are an evil, but they must sometimes be accepted when\r\nthey are necessary to the production of some good, some\r\nparticular social goal. In this case, the \"evil\" is obviously\r\ngoing to be an increase in the price of databases and the legal\r\nability to exclude competitors from their use--that, after all,\r\nis the point of granting the new right. This right of exclusion\r\nmay then have dynamic effects, hampering the ability of\r\nsubsequent innovators to build on what went before. The \"good\"\r\nis that we are supposed to get lots of new databases, databases\r\nthat we would not have had but for the existence of the database\r\nright.\r\n19\r\n\r\nIf the database right were working, we would expect positive\r\nanswers to three crucial questions. First, has the European\r\ndatabase industry's rate of growth increased since 1996, while\r\nthe U.S. database industry has languished? (The drop-off in the\r\nU.S. database industry ought to be particularly severe after\r\n1991 if the proponents of database protection are correct; they\r\nargued the Feist case was a change in current law and a great\r\nsurprise to the industry.)\r\n20\r\n\r\nSecond, are the principal beneficiaries of the database right in\r\nEurope producing databases they would not have produced\r\notherwise? Obviously, if a society is handing over a database\r\nright for a database that would have been created anyway, it is\r\noverpaying--needlessly increasing prices for consumers and\r\nburdens for competitors. This goes to the design of the\r\nright--has it been crafted too broadly, so that it is not being\r\ntargeted to those areas where it is needed to encourage\r\ninnovation?\r\n21\r\n\r\nThird, and this one is harder to judge, is the new right\r\npromoting innovation and competition rather than stifling it?\r\nFor example, if the existence of the right allowed a one-time\r\nsurge of newcomers to the market who then use their rights to\r\ndiscourage new entrants, or if we promoted some increase in\r\ndatabases but made scientific aggregation of large amounts of\r\ndata harder overall, then the database right might actually be\r\nstifling the innovation it is designed to foment.\r\n22\r\n\r\nThose are the three questions that any review of the Database\r\nDirective must answer. But we have preliminary answers to those\r\nthree questions and they are either strongly negative or\r\nextremely doubtful.\r\n23\r\n\r\nAre database rights necessary for a thriving database industry?\r\nThe answer appears to be no. In the United States, the database\r\nindustry has grown more than twenty-five-fold since 1979\r\nand--contrary to those who paint the Feist case as a\r\nrevolution--for that entire period, in most of the United States,\r\nit was clear that unoriginal databases were not covered by\r\ncopyright. The figures are even more interesting in the legal\r\ndatabase market. The two major proponents of database protection\r\nin the United States are Reed Elsevier, the owner of Lexis, and\r\nThomson Publishing, the owner of Westlaw. Fascinatingly, both\r\ncompanies made their key acquisitions in the U.S. legal database\r\nmarket after the Feist decision, at which point no one could\r\nhave thought unoriginal databases were copyrightable. This seems\r\nto be some evidence that they believed they could make money\r\neven without a database right. How? In the old-fashioned way:\r\ncompeting on features, accuracy, tied services, making users pay\r\nfor entry to the database, and so on.\r\n24\r\n\r\nIf those companies believed there were profits to be made, they\r\nwere right. Jason Gelman, a former Duke student, pointed out in\r\na recent paper that Thomson's legal regulatory division had a\r\nprofit margin of over 26 percent for the first quarter of 2004.\r\nReed Elsevier's 2003 profit margin for LexisNexis was 22.8\r\npercent. Both profit margins were significantly higher than the\r\ncompany average and both were earned primarily in the $6 billion\r\nU.S. legal database market, a market which is thriving without\r\nstrong intellectual property protection over databases. (First\r\nrule of thumb for regulators: when someone with a profit margin\r\nover 20 percent asks you for additional monopoly protection,\r\npause before agreeing.)\r\n25\r\n\r\nWhat about Europe? There is some good news for the proponents of\r\ndatabase protection. As Hugenholtz, Maurer, and Onsrud point out\r\nin a nice article in Science magazine, there was a sharp, one-\r\ntime spike in the number of companies entering the European\r\ndatabase market immediately following the implementation of the\r\nDirective in member states.2 Yet their work, and \"Across Two\r\nWorlds,\"3 a fascinating study by Maurer, suggests that the rate\r\nof entry then fell back to levels similar to those before the\r\ndirective. Maurer's analysis shows that the attrition rate was\r\nalso very high in some European markets in the period following\r\nthe passage of the directive--even with the new right, many\r\ncompanies dropped out.\r\n26\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, the British database industry--the\r\nstrongest performer in Europe--added about two hundred databases\r\nin the three years immediately after the implementation of the\r\ndirective. In France, there was little net change in the number\r\nof databases and the number of providers fell sharply. In\r\nGermany, the industry added nearly three hundred databases\r\nimmediately following the directive--a remarkable surge--about two\r\nhundred of which rapidly disappeared. During the same period,\r\nthe U.S. industry added about nine hundred databases. Bottom\r\nline? Europe's industry did get a one-time boost and some of\r\nthose firms have stayed in the market; that is a benefit, though\r\na costly one. But database growth rates have gone back to\r\npredirective levels, while the anticompetitive costs of database\r\nprotection are now a permanent fixture of the European\r\nlandscape. The United States, by contrast, gets a nice steady\r\ngrowth rate in databases without paying the monopoly cost.\r\n(Second rule of thumb for regulators: Do no harm! Do not create\r\nrights without strong evidence that the incentive effect is\r\nworth the anticompetitive cost.)\r\n27\r\n\r\nNow the second question. Is the Database Directive encouraging\r\nthe production of databases we would not have gotten otherwise?\r\nHere the evidence is clear and disturbing. Again, Hugenholtz et\r\nal. point out that the majority of cases brought under the\r\ndirective have been about databases that would have been created\r\nanyway--telephone numbers, television schedules, concert times. A\r\nreview of more recent cases reveals the same pattern. These\r\ndatabases are inevitably generated by the operation of the\r\nbusiness in question and cannot be independently compiled by a\r\ncompetitor. The database right simply serves to limit\r\ncompetition in the provision of the information. Recently, the\r\nEuropean Court of Justice implicitly underscored this point in a\r\nseries of cases concerning football scores, horse racing\r\nresults, and so on. Rejecting a protectionist and one-sided\r\nopinion from its Advocate General, the court ruled that the mere\r\nrunning of a business which generates data does not count as\r\n\"substantial investment\" sufficient to trigger the database\r\nright. It would be nice to think that this is the beginning of\r\nsome skepticism about the reach of the directive. Yet the court\r\nprovides little discussion of the economic reasons behind its\r\ninterpretation; the analysis is merely semantic and\r\ndefinitional, a sharp contrast to its competition decisions.\r\n28\r\n\r\nSo what kinds of creations are being generated by this bold new\r\nright? The answer is somewhere between bathos and pathos. Here\r\nare some of the wonderful \"databases\" that people found it\r\nworthwhile litigating over: a Web site consisting of a\r\ncollection of 259 hyperlinks to \"parenting resources,\" a\r\ncollection of poems, an assortment of advertisements, headings\r\nreferring to local news, and charts of popular music. The sad\r\nlist goes on and on. The European Commission might ask itself\r\nwhether these are really the kind of \"databases\" that we need a\r\nlegal monopoly to encourage and that we want to tie up judicial\r\nresources protecting. The point that many more such factual\r\nresources can be found online in the United States without any\r\nlegalized database protection also seems worthy of note. At the\r\nvery least, the evidence indicates that the right is drawn much\r\ntoo broadly and triggered too easily in ways that produce\r\nlitigation but little social benefit.\r\n29\r\n\r\nNow, in one sense, these lawsuits over trivial collections of\r\nhyperlinks and headlines might be seen as irrelevant. They may\r\nindicate we are handing out rights unnecessarily--did we really\r\nneed a legal monopoly, and court involvement, to get someone to\r\ncompile hyperlinks on a Web page? But it is hard to see social\r\nharm. As with the patents over \"sealed crustless\" peanut butter\r\nsandwiches or \"methods of swinging on a swing,\" we may shake our\r\nheads at the stupidity of the system, but if the problems\r\nconsist only of trivial creations, at least we are not likely to\r\ngrieve because some vital piece of information was locked up.\r\nBut we should not be so quick to declare such examples\r\nirrelevant. They tend to show that the system for drawing the\r\nboundaries of the right is broken--and that is of general\r\nconcern, even if the issue at hand is not.\r\n30\r\n\r\nFinally, is the database right encouraging scientific innovation\r\nor hurting it? Here the evidence is merely suggestive.\r\nScientists have claimed that the European database right,\r\ntogether with the perverse failure of European governments to\r\ntake advantage of the limited scientific research exceptions\r\nallowed by the directive, have made it much harder to aggregate\r\ndata, to replicate studies, and to judge published articles. In\r\nfact, academic scientific bodies have been among the strongest\r\ncritics of database protection. But negative evidence, by its\r\nnature, is hard to produce; \"show me the science that did not\r\nget done!\" Certainly, both U.S. science and commerce have\r\nbenefited extraordinarily from the openness of U.S. data policy.\r\nI will deal with this issue in the next part of this chapter.\r\n31\r\n\r\nIf the United States does not give intellectual property\r\nprotection to raw data, to facts, how is it that the database\r\nindustry has managed to thrive here and to do better than in\r\nEurope, which has extremely strong protection? The economists\r\ndescribed in Chapter 1 would surely tell us that this is a\r\npotential \"public goods\" problem. If it is hard to exclude\r\nothers from the resource--it is cheap and easy to copy--and if the\r\nuse of the resource is not \"rival\"--if I don't use up your facts\r\nby consulting them--then we ought to see the kind of dystopia\r\neconomists predict. What would that consist of? First it might\r\nresult in underproduction. Databases with a social value higher\r\nthan their cost of creation would not get made because the\r\ncreator could not get an adequate return on investment. In some\r\ncases it might even lead to the reverse--overproduction, where\r\neach party creates the database for itself. We get a social\r\noverinvestment to produce the resource because there is no legal\r\nright to exclude others from it. If you gave the first creator\r\nan intellectual property right over the data, they could sell to\r\nsubsequent users at a price lower than their own cost to create\r\nthe database. Everyone would win. But the United States did not\r\ngive the intellectual property right and yet its database\r\nindustry is flourishing. There are lots of commercial database\r\nproviders and many different kinds of databases. How can this\r\nbe? Is the economic model wrong?\r\n32\r\n\r\nThe answer to that is no, the model is not wrong. It is,\r\nhowever, incomplete and all too often applied in sweeping ways\r\nwithout acknowledging that its basic assumptions may not hold in\r\na particular case. That sounds vague. Let me give a concrete\r\nexample. Westlaw is one of the two leading legal database\r\nproviders and, as I mentioned before, one of the key proponents\r\nof creating intellectual property rights over unoriginal\r\ndatabases. (There is considerable question whether such a law\r\nwould be constitutional in the United States, but I will pass\r\nover that argument for the moment.) Westlaw's \"problem\" is that\r\nmuch of the material that it provides to its subscribers is not\r\ncovered by copyright. Under Section 105 of the U.S. Copyright\r\nAct, works of the federal government cannot be copyrighted. They\r\npass immediately into the public domain. Thus all the federal\r\ncourt decisions, from district courts all the way up to the\r\nSupreme Court, all the federal statutes, the infinite complexity\r\nof the Federal Register, all this is free from copyright. This\r\nmight seem logical for government-created work, for which the\r\ntaxpayer has already paid, but as I will explain in the next\r\nsection of the chapter, not every country adopts such a policy.\r\n33\r\n\r\nWest, another Thomson subsidiary that owns Westlaw, publishes\r\nthe standard case reporter series. When lawyers or judges refer\r\nto a particular opinion, or quote a passage within an opinion,\r\nthey will almost always use the page number of the West edition.\r\nAfter all, if no one else can find the cases or statutes or\r\nparagraphs of an opinion that you are referring to, legal\r\nargument is all but impossible. (This might seem like a great\r\nidea to you. I beg to differ.) As electronic versions of legal\r\nmaterials became more prevalent, West began getting more\r\ncompetition. Its competitors did two things that West found\r\nunforgivable. First, they frequently copied the text of the\r\ncases from West's electronic services, or CD-ROMs, rather than\r\nretyping them themselves. Since the cases were works of the\r\nfederal government, this was perfectly legal provided the\r\ncompetitors did not include West's own material, such as\r\nsummaries of the cases written by its employees or its key\r\nnumber system for finding related issues. Second, the\r\ncompetitors would include, within their electronic editions, the\r\npage numbers to West's editions. Since lawyers need to cite the\r\nprecise words or arguments they are referring to, providing the\r\nraw opinion alone would have been all but useless. Because\r\nWest's page numbers were one of the standard ways to cite case\r\nopinions, competitors would indicate where the page breaks on\r\nthe printed page would have been, just as West did in its own\r\ndatabases.\r\n34\r\n\r\nWest's reaction to all of this was exactly like Apple's reaction\r\nin the story I told in Chapter 5 about the iPod or like Rural's\r\nreaction to the copying of its phone directory. This was theft!\r\nThey were freeloading on West's hard work! West had mixed its\r\nsweat with these cites, and so should be able to exclude other\r\npeople from them! Since it could not claim copyright over the\r\ncases, West claimed copyright over the order in which they were\r\narranged, saying that when its competitors provided its page\r\nnumbers for citation purposes, they were infringing that\r\ncopyright.\r\n35\r\n\r\nIn the end, West lost its legal battles to claim copyright over\r\nthe arrangement of the collections of cases and the sequence in\r\nwhich they were presented. The Court held that, as with the\r\nphone directory, the order in which the cases were arranged\r\nlacked the minimum originality required to sustain a copyright\r\nclaim.4 At this stage, according to the standard public goods\r\nstory, West's business should have collapsed. Unable to exclude\r\ncompetitors from much of the raw material of its databases, West\r\nwould be undercut by competitors. More importantly, from the\r\npoint of view of intellectual property policy, its fate would\r\ndeter potential investors in other databases--databases that we\r\nwould lose without even knowing they could have been possible.\r\nExcept that is not the way it turned out. West has continued to\r\nthrive. Indeed, its profits have been quite remarkable. How can\r\nthis be?\r\n36\r\n\r\nThe West story shows us three ways in which we can leap too\r\nquickly from the abstract claim that some information goods are\r\npublic goods--nonexcludable and nonrival--to the claim that this\r\nparticular information good has those attributes. The reality is\r\nmuch more complex. Type www.westlaw.com into your Internet\r\nbrowser. That will take you to the home page of West's excellent\r\nlegal research service. Now, I have a password to that site. You\r\nprobably do not. Without a password, you cannot get access to\r\nWest's site at all. To the average consumer, the password acts\r\nas a physical or technical barrier, making the good\r\n\"excludable\"--that is, making it possible to exclude someone from\r\nit without invoking intellectual property rights. But what about\r\ncompetitors? They could buy access and use that access to\r\ndownload vast quantities of the material that is unprotected by\r\ncopyright. Or could they? Again, West can erect a variety of\r\nbarriers, ranging from technical limits on how much can be\r\ndownloaded to contractual restrictions on what those who\r\npurchase its service can do (\"No copying every federal case,\"\r\nfor example).\r\n37\r\n\r\nLet's say the competitor somehow manages to get around all this.\r\nLet's say it somehow avoids copying the material that West does\r\nhave a copyright over--such as the headnotes and case synopses.\r\nThe competitor launches their competing site at lower prices\r\namidst much fanfare. Do I immediately and faithlessly desert\r\nWest for a lower-priced competitor? Not at all. First of all,\r\nthere are lots of useful things in the West database that are\r\ncovered by copyright--law review articles and certain treatises,\r\nfor example. The competitor frequently cannot copy those without\r\ncoming to the same sort of agreements that West has with the\r\ncopyright holders. For much legal research, that secondary\r\nmaterial is as important as the cases. If West has both, and the\r\ncompetitor only one, I will stick with West. Second, West's\r\nservice is very well designed. (It is only their copyright\r\npolicies I dislike, not the product.) If a judge cites a law\r\nreview article in a case, West will helpfully provide a\r\nhyperlink to the precise section of the article she is referring\r\nto. I can click on it and in a second see what the substance of\r\nthe argument is. The reverse is true if a law review article\r\ncites a statute or a case. Cases have \"flags\" on them indicating\r\nwhether they have been overruled or cited approvingly in\r\nsubsequent decisions. In other words, faced with the competitive\r\npressure of those who would commoditize their service and\r\nprovide it at lower cost, West has done what any smart company\r\nwould: added features and competed by offering a superior\r\nservice. Often it has done so by \"tying\" its uncopyrightable\r\ndata structures to its huge library of copyrighted legal\r\nmaterial.\r\n38\r\n\r\nThe company that challenged Westlaw in court was called\r\nHyperlaw. It won triumphantly. The courts declared that federal\r\ncases and the page numbers in the West volumes were in the\r\npublic domain. That decision came in 1998 and Westlaw has\r\nlobbied hard since then to reverse it by statute, to create some\r\nversion of the Database Directive in the United States. To date,\r\nthey have failed. The victor, Hyperlaw, has since gone out of\r\nbusiness. Westlaw has not.\r\n39\r\n\r\nThis little story contains a larger truth. It is true that\r\ninnovation and information goods will, in general, tend to be\r\nless excludable and less rival than a ham sandwich, say. But, in\r\npractice, some of them will be linked or connected in their\r\nsocial setting to other phenomena that are highly excludable.\r\nThe software can easily be copied--but access to the help lines\r\ncan be restricted with ease. Audiences cannot easily be excluded\r\nfrom viewing television broadcasts, but advertisers can easily\r\nbe excluded from placing their advertisements in those programs.\r\nThe noncopyrightable court decisions are of most use when\r\nembedded within a technical system that gives easy access to\r\nother material--some of it copyrighted and all of it protected by\r\ntechnical measures and contractual restrictions. The music file\r\ncan be downloaded; the band's T-shirt or the experience of the\r\nlive concert cannot. Does this mean that we never need an\r\nintellectual property right? Not at all. But it does indicate\r\nthat we need to be careful when someone claims that \"without a\r\nnew intellectual property right I am doomed.\"\r\n40\r\n\r\nOne final story may drive home the point. When they read Feist\r\nv. Rural, law students often assume that the only reason Feist\r\noffered to license the white pages listings from Rural is\r\nbecause they (mistakenly) thought they were copyrighted. This is\r\nunlikely. Most good copyright lawyers would have told you at the\r\ntime of the Feist case that the \"sweat of the brow\" decisions\r\nthat gave copyright protection based on hard work were not good\r\nlaw. Most courts of appeals had said so. True, there was some\r\nlegal uncertainty, and that is often worth paying to avoid. But\r\nswitch the question around and suppose it is the day after the\r\nSupreme Court decides the Feist case, and Feist is heading off\r\ninto another market to try to make a new regional phone\r\ndirectory. Do they now just take the numbers without paying for\r\nthem, or do they still try to negotiate a license? The latter is\r\noverwhelmingly likely. Why? Well, for one thing, they would get\r\na computer-readable version of the names and would not have to\r\nretype or optically scan them. More importantly, the contract\r\ncould include a right to immediate updates and new listings.\r\n41\r\n\r\nThe day after the Feist decision, the only thing that had\r\nchanged in the telephone directory market was that telephone\r\ncompanies knew for sure, rather than merely as a probability,\r\nthat if they refused to license, their competitors could\r\nlaboriously copy their old listings without penalty. The nuclear\r\noption was no longer available. Maybe the price demanded would\r\nbe a little lower. But there would still be lots of good reasons\r\nfor Feist to buy the information, even though it was\r\nuncopyrighted. You do not always need an intellectual property\r\nright to make a deal. Of course, that is not the whole story.\r\nPerhaps the incentives provided by other methods are\r\ninsufficient. But in the U.S. database industry they do not seem\r\nto have been. Quite the contrary. The studies we have on the\r\nEuropean and the American rules on database rights indicate that\r\nthe American approach simply works better.\r\n42\r\n\r\nI was not always opposed to intellectual property rights over\r\ndata. Indeed, in a book written before the enactment of the\r\nDatabase Directive, I said that there was a respectable economic\r\nargument that such protection might be warranted and that we\r\nneeded research on the issue.5 Unfortunately, Europe got the\r\nright without the research. The facts are now in. If the\r\nEuropean Database Directive were a drug, the government would be\r\npulling it from the market until its efficacy and harmfulness\r\ncould be reassessed. At the very least, the Commission needed a\r\ndetailed empirical review of the directive's effects, and needs\r\nto adjust the directive's definitions and fine-tune its\r\nlimitations. But there is a second lesson. There is more\r\ndiscussion of the empirical economic effects of the Database\r\nDirective in this chapter than in the six-hundred-page review of\r\nthe directive that the European Commission paid a private\r\ncompany to conduct, and which was the first official document to\r\nconsider the issue.\r\n43\r\n\r\nThat seemed to me and to many other academics to be a scandal\r\nand we said so as loudly as we could, pointing out the empirical\r\nevidence suggesting that the directive was not working. Yet if\r\nit was a scandal, it was not a surprising one, because the\r\nevidence-free process is altogether typical of the way we make\r\nintellectual property policy. President Bush is not the only one\r\nto make \"faith-based\" decisions.\r\n44\r\n\r\nThere was, however, a ray of hope. In its official report on the\r\ncompetitive effects of the Database Directive, the European\r\nCommission recently went beyond reliance on anecdote and\r\nindustry testimony and did something amazing and admirable. It\r\nconducted an empirical evaluation of whether the directive was\r\nactually doing any good.\r\n45\r\n\r\nThe report honestly described the directive as \"a Community\r\ncreation with no precedent in any international convention.\"\r\nUsing a methodology similar to the one in this chapter on the\r\nsubject, the Commission found that \"the economic impact of the\r\n'sui generis' right on database production is unproven.\r\nIntroduced to stimulate the production of databases in Europe,\r\nthe new instrument has had no proven impact on the production of\r\ndatabases.\"6\r\n46\r\n\r\nIn fact, their study showed that the production of databases had\r\nfallen to pre-directive levels and that the U.S. database\r\nindustry, which has no such intellectual property right, was\r\ngrowing faster than the European Union's. The gap appears to be\r\nwidening. This is consistent with the data I had pointed out in\r\nnewspaper articles on the subject, but the Commission's study\r\nwas more recent and, if anything, more damning.\r\n47\r\n\r\nCommission insiders hinted that the study may be part of a\r\nlarger--and welcome--transformation in which a more professional\r\nand empirical look is being taken at the competitive effects of\r\nintellectual property protection. Could we be moving away from\r\nfaith-based policy in which the assumption is that the more new\r\nrights we create, the better off we will be? Perhaps. But\r\nunfortunately, while the report was a dramatic improvement,\r\ntraces of the Commission's older predilection for faith-based\r\npolicy and voodoo economics still remain.\r\n48\r\n\r\nThe Commission coupled its empirical study of whether the\r\ndirective had actually stimulated the production of new\r\ndatabases with another intriguing kind of empiricism. It sent\r\nout a questionnaire to the European database industry asking if\r\nthey liked their intellectual property right--a procedure with\r\nall the rigor of setting farm policy by asking French farmers\r\nhow they feel about agricultural subsidies. More bizarrely\r\nstill, the report sometimes juxtaposed the two studies as if\r\nthey were of equivalent worth. Perhaps this method of decision\r\nmaking could be expanded to other areas. We could set\r\ncommunications policy by conducting psychoanalytic interviews\r\nwith state telephone companies--let current incumbents' opinions\r\ndetermine what is good for the market as a whole. \"What is your\r\nemotional relationship with your monopoly?\" \"I really like it!\"\r\n\"Do you think it hurts competition?\" \"Not at all!\"\r\n49\r\n\r\nThere are also a few places where the reasoning in the report\r\nleft one scratching one's head. One goal of the database right\r\nwas to help close the gap between the size of the European and\r\nU.S. database markets. Even before the directive, most European\r\ncountries already gave greater protection than the United States\r\nto compilations of fact. The directive raised the level still\r\nhigher. The theory was that this would help build European\r\nmarket share. Of course, the opposite is also possible. Setting\r\nintellectual property rights too high can actually stunt\r\ninnovation. In practice, as the Commission's report observes,\r\n\"the ratio of European / U.S. database production, which was\r\nnearly 1:2 in 1996, has become 1:3 in 2004.\"7 Europe had started\r\nwith higher protection and a smaller market. Then it raised its\r\nlevel of protection and lost even more ground. Yet the report\r\nwas oddly diffident about the possibility that the U.S. system\r\nactually works better.\r\n50\r\n\r\nIn its conclusion, the report offered a number of possibilities,\r\nincluding repealing the directive, amending it to limit or\r\nremove the \"sui generis\" right while leaving the rest of the\r\ndirective in place, and keeping the system as it is. The first\r\noptions are easy to understand. Who would want to keep a system\r\nwhen it is not increasing database production, or European\r\nmarket share, and, indeed, might be actively harmful? Why leave\r\nthings as they are? The report offers several reasons.\r\n51\r\n\r\nFirst, database companies want to keep the directive. (The\r\nreport delicately notes that their \"endorsement . . . is\r\nsomewhat at odds with the continued success of U.S. publishing\r\nand database production that thrives without . . . [such]\r\nprotection,\" but nevertheless appears to be \"a political\r\nreality.\") Second, repealing the directive would reopen the\r\ndebate on what level of protection is needed. Third, change may\r\nbe costly.\r\n52\r\n\r\nImagine applying these arguments to a drug trial. The patients\r\nin the control group have done better than those given the drug\r\nand there is evidence that the drug might be harmful. But the\r\ndrug companies like their profits and want to keep the drug on\r\nthe market. Though \"somewhat at odds\" with the evidence, this is\r\na \"political reality.\" Getting rid of the drug would reopen the\r\ndebate on the search for a cure. Change is costly--true. But what\r\nis the purpose of a review if the status quo is always to be\r\npreferred?\r\n53\r\n\r\nThe final result? Faced with what Commission staff members tell\r\nme was a tidal wave of lobbying from publishers, the Commission\r\nquietly decided to leave the directive unchanged, despite the\r\nevidence. The result itself is not remarkable. Industry capture\r\nof a regulatory apparatus is hardly a surprise. What is\r\nremarkable is that this is one of the first times any entity\r\nengaged in making intellectual property policy on the\r\ninternational level has even looked seriously at the empirical\r\nevidence of that policy's effects.\r\n54\r\n\r\nTo be sure, figures are thrown around in hearings. The software\r\nindustry will present studies showing, for example, that it has\r\nlost billions of dollars because of illicit copying. It has\r\nindeed lost profits relative to what it could get with all the\r\nbenefits of cheaper copying and transmission worldwide and with\r\nperfect copyright enforcement as well. (Though the methodology\r\nof some of the studies, which assumes that each copier would\r\nhave paid full price--is ridiculous.) But this simply begs the\r\nquestion. A new technology is introduced that increases the size\r\nof your market and decreases your costs dramatically, but also\r\nincreases illicit copying. Is this cause for state intervention\r\nto increase your level of rights or the funds going toward\r\nenforcement of copyright law, as opposed to any other law\r\nenforcement priority? The question for empirical analysis, both\r\nbefore and after a policy change, should be \"Is this change\r\nnecessary in order to maintain incentives for production and\r\ndistribution? Will whatever benefits it brings outweigh the\r\ncosts of static and dynamic losses--price increases to consumers\r\nand impediments to future innovators?\" The content companies\r\nmight still be able to justify the extensions of their rights.\r\nBut they would be doing so in the context of a rational,\r\nevidence-based debate about the real goals of intellectual\r\nproperty, not on the assumption that they have a natural right\r\nto collect all the economic surplus gained by a reduction in the\r\ncosts of reproduction and distribution.\r\n55\r\n\r\nDOES PUBLIC INFORMATION WANT TO BE FREE?\r\n56\r\n\r\nThe United States has much to learn from Europe about\r\ninformation policy. The ineffectively scattered U.S. approach to\r\ndata privacy, for example, produces random islands of privacy\r\nprotection in a sea of potential vulnerability. Until recently,\r\nyour video rental records were better protected than your\r\nmedical records. Europe, by contrast, has tried to establish a\r\nholistic framework, a much more effective approach. But there\r\nare places where the lessons should flow the other way. The\r\nfirst one, I have suggested, is database protection. The second\r\nis a related but separate issue: the legal treatment of publicly\r\ngenerated data, the huge, and hugely important, flow of\r\ninformation produced by government-funded activities--from\r\nordnance survey maps and weather data to state-produced texts,\r\ntraffic studies, and scientific information. How is this flow of\r\ninformation distributed? The norm turns out to be very different\r\nin the United States and in Europe.\r\n57\r\n\r\nIn one part of the world, state-produced data flows are\r\nfrequently viewed as revenue sources. They are often copyrighted\r\nor protected by database rights. Many of the departments which\r\nproduce them attempt to make a profit or at least to recover\r\ntheir entire operating costs through user fees. It is heresy to\r\nsuggest that the taxpayer has already paid for the production of\r\nthis data and should not have to do so twice. The other part of\r\nthe world practices a benign form of information socialism. By\r\nlaw, any text produced by the central government is free from\r\ncopyright and passes immediately into the public domain. The\r\nbasic norm is that public data flows should be available at the\r\ncost of reproduction alone.\r\n58\r\n\r\nIt is easy to guess which area is which. The United States is\r\nsurely the profit and property-obsessed realm, Europe the place\r\nwhere the state takes pride in providing data as a public\r\nservice? No, actually, it is the other way around.\r\n59\r\n\r\nTake weather data. The United States makes complete weather data\r\navailable to all at the cost of reproduction. If the superb\r\ngovernment Web sites and data feeds are insufficient, for the\r\ncost of a box of blank DVDs you can have the entire history of\r\nweather records across the continental United States. European\r\ncountries, by contrast, typically claim government copyright\r\nover weather data and often require the payment of substantial\r\nfees. Which approach is better? I have been studying the issue\r\nfor fifteen years, and if I had to suggest a single article it\r\nwould be the magisterial study by Peter Weiss called \"Borders in\r\nCyberspace,\" published by the National Academies of Science.8\r\nWeiss shows that the U.S. approach generates far more social\r\nwealth. True, the information is initially provided for free,\r\nbut a thriving private weather industry has sprung up which\r\ntakes the publicly funded data as its raw material and then adds\r\nvalue to it. The U.S. weather risk management industry, for\r\nexample, is more than ten times bigger than the European one,\r\nemploying more people, producing more valuable products,\r\ngenerating more social wealth. Another study estimates that\r\nEurope invests 9.5 billion Euros in weather data and gets\r\napproximately 68 billion back in economic value--in everything\r\nfrom more efficient farming and construction decisions to better\r\nholiday planning--a sevenfold multiplier. The United States, by\r\ncontrast, invests twice as much--19 billion--but gets back a\r\nreturn of 750 billion Euros, a thirty-nine-fold multiplier.\r\n60\r\n\r\nOther studies suggest similar patterns elsewhere, in areas\r\nranging from geospatial data to traffic patterns and\r\nagriculture. The \"free\" information flow is better at priming\r\nthe pump of economic activity.\r\n61\r\n\r\nSome readers may not thrill to this way of looking at things\r\nbecause it smacks of private corporations getting a \"free ride\"\r\non the public purse--social wealth be damned. But the benefits of\r\nopen data policies go further. Every year the monsoon season\r\nkills hundreds and causes massive property damage in Southeast\r\nAsia. One set of monsoon rains alone killed 660 people in India\r\nand left 4.5 million homeless. Researchers seeking to predict\r\nthe monsoon sought complete weather records from the United\r\nStates and Europe so as to generate a model based on global\r\nweather patterns. The U.S. data was easily and cheaply available\r\nat the cost of reproduction. The researchers could not afford to\r\npay the price asked by the European weather services, precluding\r\nthe \"ensemble\" analysis they sought to do. Weiss asks\r\nrhetorically, \"What is the economic and social harm to over 1\r\nbillion people from hampered research?\" In the wake of the\r\noutpouring of sympathy for tsunami victims in the same region,\r\nthis example seems somehow even more tragic. Will the pattern be\r\nrepeated with seismographic, cartographic, and satellite data?\r\nOne hopes not.\r\n62\r\n\r\nThe European attitude may be changing. Competition policy has\r\nalready been a powerful force in pushing countries to rethink\r\ntheir attitudes to government data. The European Directive on\r\nthe Reuse of Public Sector Information takes large strides in\r\nthe right direction, as do studies by the Organization for\r\nEconomic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and several\r\nnational initiatives.9 Unfortunately, though, most of these\r\nfollow the same pattern. An initially strong draft is watered\r\ndown and the utterly crucial question of whether data should be\r\nprovided at the marginal cost of reproduction is fudged or\r\navoided. This is a shame. Again, if we really believed in\r\nevidence-based policy making, the debate would be very\r\ndifferent.\r\n63\r\n\r\nBREAKING THE DEAL\r\n64\r\n\r\nWhat would the debate look like if we took some of the steps I\r\nmention here? Unfortunately there are very few examples of\r\nevidence-based policy making, but the few that do exist are\r\nstriking.\r\n65\r\n\r\nIn 2006, the government-convened Gowers Review of intellectual\r\nproperty policy in the United Kingdom considered a number of\r\nproposals on changes to copyright law, including a retrospective\r\nextension of sound recording copyright terms.10 The copyright\r\nterm for sound recordings in the United Kingdom is fifty years.\r\n(It is longer for compositions.) At the end of the fifty-year\r\nperiod, the recording enters the public domain. If the\r\ncomposition is also in the public domain--the great orchestral\r\nworks of Beethoven, Brahms, and Mozart, for example, or the jazz\r\nclassics of the early twentieth century--then anyone can copy the\r\nrecording. This means we could make it freely available in an\r\nonline repository for music students throughout Britain--perhaps\r\npreparing the next generation of performers--or republish it in a\r\ndigitally cleansed and enhanced edition. If the composition is\r\nstill under copyright, as with much popular music, then the\r\ncomposer is still entitled to a licensing fee, but now any music\r\npublisher who pays that fee can reissue the work--introducing\r\ncompetition and, presumably, bringing down prices of the\r\nrecording.\r\n66\r\n\r\nThe recording industry, along with successful artists such as\r\nSir Cliff Richard and Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull, wished to\r\nextend the fifty-year term to ninety-five years, or perhaps even\r\nlonger--the life of the performer, plus seventy years. This\r\nproposal was not just for new recordings, but for the ones that\r\nhave already been made.\r\n67\r\n\r\nThink of the copyright system as offering a deal to artists and\r\nrecord companies. \"We will enlist the force of the state to give\r\nyou fifty years of monopoly over your recordings. During that\r\ntime, you will have the exclusive right to distribute and\r\nreproduce your recording. After that time, it is available to\r\nall, just as you benefited from the availability of public\r\ndomain works from your predecessors. Will you make records under\r\nthese terms?\"\r\n68\r\n\r\nObviously, fifty years of legalized exclusivity was enough of an\r\nincentive to get them to make the music in the first place. We\r\nhave the unimpeachable evidence that they actually did. Now they\r\nwant to change the terms of the deal retrospectively. They say\r\nthis will \"harmonize\" the law internationally, give recordings\r\nthe same treatment as compositions, help struggling musicians,\r\nand give the recording industry some extra money that it might\r\nspend on developing new talent. (Or on Porsches, shareholder\r\ndividends, and plastic ducks. If you give me another forty-five\r\nyears of monopoly rent, I can spend it as I wish.)\r\n69\r\n\r\nChange the context and think about how you would react to this\r\nif the deal was presented to you personally. You hired an artist\r\nto paint a portrait. You offered $500. He agreed. You had a\r\ndeal. He painted the painting. You liked it. You gave him the\r\nmoney. A few years later he returned. \"You owe me another $450,\"\r\nhe said.\r\n70\r\n\r\nYou both looked at the contract. \"But you agreed to paint it for\r\n$500 and I paid you that amount.\" He admitted this was true, but\r\npointed out that painters in other countries sometimes received\r\nhigher amounts, as did sculptors in our own country. In fact, he\r\ntold you, all painters in our country planned to demand another\r\n$450 for each picture they had already painted as well as for\r\nfuture pictures. This would \"harmonize\" our prices with other\r\ncountries, put painting on the same footing as sculpture, and\r\nenable painters to hire more apprentices. His other argument was\r\nthat painters often lost money. Only changing the terms of their\r\ndeals long after they were struck could keep them in business.\r\nPaying the money was your duty. If you did not pay, it meant\r\nthat you did not respect art and private property.\r\n71\r\n\r\nYou would find these arguments absurd. Yet they are the same\r\nones the record industry used, relying heavily on the confusions\r\nagainst which this book has warned. Is the record companies'\r\nidea as outrageous as the demands of my imaginary painter? It is\r\nactually worse.\r\n72\r\n\r\nThe majority of sound recordings made more than forty years ago\r\nare commercially unavailable. After fifty years, only a tiny\r\npercentage are still being sold. It is extremely hard to find\r\nthe copyright holders of the remainder. They might have died,\r\ngone out of business, or simply stopped caring. Even if the\r\ncomposer can be found, or paid through a collection society,\r\nwithout the consent of the holder of the copyright over the\r\nmusical recording, the work must stay in the library. These are\r\n\"orphan works\"--a category that probably comprises the majority\r\nof twentieth-century cultural artifacts.\r\n73\r\n\r\nYet as I pointed out earlier, without the copyright holder's\r\npermission, it is illegal to copy or redistribute or perform\r\nthese works, even if it is done on a nonprofit basis. The goal\r\nof copyright is to encourage the production of, and public\r\naccess to, cultural works. It has done its job in encouraging\r\nproduction. Now it operates as a fence to discourage access. As\r\nthe years go by, we continue to lock up 100 percent of our\r\nrecorded culture from a particular year in order to benefit an\r\never-dwindling percentage--the lottery winners--in a grotesquely\r\ninefficient cultural policy.\r\n74\r\n\r\nFinally, fifty years after they were made, sound recordings\r\nenter the public domain in the United Kingdom (though as I\r\npointed out earlier, licensing fees would still be due to the\r\ncomposer if the work itself was still under copyright). Now\r\nanyone--individual, company, specialist in public domain\r\nmaterial--could offer the work to the public. But not if the\r\nrecord companies can persuade the government otherwise. Like my\r\nimaginary painter, they want to change the terms of the deal\r\nretrospectively. But at least the painter's proposal would not\r\nmake the vast majority of paintings unavailable just to benefit\r\na tiny minority of current artists.\r\n75\r\n\r\nThe recording industry's proposal for retrospective extension\r\nwas effectively a tax on the British music-buying public to\r\nbenefit the copyright holders of a tiny proportion of sound\r\nrecordings. The public loses three times. It loses first when it\r\nis forced to continue to pay monopoly prices for older,\r\ncommercially available music, rather than getting the benefit of\r\nthe bargain British legislators originally offered: fifty years\r\nof exclusivity, then the public domain. The public loses a\r\nsecond time when, as a side effect, it is denied access to\r\ncommercially unavailable music; no library or niche publisher\r\ncan make the forgotten recordings available again. Finally, the\r\npublic loses a third time because allowing retrospective\r\nextensions will distort the political process in the future,\r\nleading to an almost inevitable legislative capture by the tiny\r\nminority who find that their work still has commercial value at\r\nthe end of the copyright term they were originally granted. As\r\nLarry Lessig has pointed out repeatedly, the time to have the\r\ndebate about the length of the copyright term is before we know\r\nwhose works will survive commercially.\r\n76\r\n\r\nThe whole idea is very silly. But if this is the silly idea we\r\nwish to pursue, then simply increase the income tax\r\nproportionately and distribute the benefits to those record\r\ncompanies and musicians whose music is still commercially\r\navailable after fifty years. Require them to put the money into\r\ndeveloping new artists--something the current proposal does not\r\ndo. Let all the other recordings pass into the public domain.\r\n77\r\n\r\nOf course, no government would consider such an idea for a\r\nmoment. Tax the public to give a monopoly windfall to those who\r\nalready hit the jackpot, because they claim their industry\r\ncannot survive without retrospectively changing the terms of its\r\ndeals? It is indeed laughable. Yet it is a far better proposal\r\nthan the one that was presented to the Gowers Review.\r\n78\r\n\r\nWhat happened next was instructive. The Review commissioned an\r\neconomic study of the effects of copyright term extension--both\r\nprospective and retrospective--on recorded music from the\r\nUniversity of Cambridge's Centre for Intellectual Property and\r\nInformation Law. The resulting document was a model of its\r\nkind.11\r\n79\r\n\r\nWith painstaking care and a real (if sometimes fruitless)\r\nattempt to make economic arguments accessible to ordinary human\r\nbeings, the study laid out the costs and benefits of extending\r\nthe copyright term over sound recordings. It pointed out that\r\nthe time to measure the value of a prospective term extension is\r\nat the moment the copyright is granted. Only then does it\r\nproduce its incentive effects. The question one must ask is how\r\nmuch value today does it give an artist or record company to\r\nhave their copyright extended by a year at the end of the\r\nexisting period of protection. Then one must look to see whether\r\nthe benefits of the added incentive outweigh the social costs it\r\nimposes. To put it another way, if the state were selling today\r\nthe rights to have protection from year fifty to year ninety-\r\nfive, how much would a rational copyright holder pay,\r\nparticularly knowing that there is only a small likelihood the\r\nwork will even be commercially available to take advantage of\r\nthe extension? Would that amount be greater than the losses\r\nimposed on society by extending the right?\r\n80\r\n\r\nObviously, the value of the extension is affected by our\r\n\"discount rate\"--the annual amount by which we must discount a\r\npound sterling in royalties I will not receive for fifty-one\r\nyears in order to find its value now. Unsurprisingly, one finds\r\nthat the value of that pound in the future is tiny at the moment\r\nwhen it matters--today--in the calculation of an artist or\r\ndistributor making the decision whether to create. Conservative\r\nestimates yield a present value between 3 percent and 9 percent\r\nof the eventual amount. By that analysis, a pound in fifty years\r\nis worth between three and nine pence to you today, while other\r\nestimates have the value falling below one penny. This seems\r\nunlikely to spur much creativity at the margin. Or to put it in\r\nthe more elegant language of Macaulay, quoted in Chapter 2:\r\n81\r\n\r\n    I will take an example. Dr. Johnson died fifty-six years\r\nago. If the law were what my honourable and learned friend\r\nwishes to make it, somebody would now have the monopoly of Dr.\r\nJohnson's works. Who that somebody would be it is impossible to\r\nsay; but we may venture to guess. I guess, then, that it would\r\nhave been some bookseller, who was the assign of another\r\nbookseller, who was the grandson of a third bookseller, who had\r\nbought the copyright from Black Frank, the Doctor's servant and\r\nresiduary legatee, in 1785 or 1786. Now, would the knowledge\r\nthat this copyright would exist in 1841 have been a source of\r\ngratification to Johnson? Would it have stimulated his\r\nexertions? Would it have once drawn him out of his bed before\r\nnoon? Would it have once cheered him under a fit of the spleen?\r\nWould it have induced him to give us one more allegory, one more\r\nlife of a poet, one more imitation of Juvenal? I firmly believe\r\nnot. I firmly believe that a hundred years ago, when he was\r\nwriting our debates for the Gentleman's Magazine, he would very\r\nmuch rather have had twopence to buy a plate of shin of beef at\r\na cook's shop underground.12\r\n82\r\n\r\nThe art form is different, but the thought of a 1960s Cliff\r\nRichard or Ian Anderson being \"cheered under a fit of the\r\nspleen\" by the prospect of a copyright extension fifty years\r\nhence is truly a lovely one.\r\n83\r\n\r\nConsidering all these factors, as well as the effects on\r\ninvestment in British versus American music and on the balance\r\nof trade, the Cambridge study found that the extension would\r\ncost consumers between 240 and 480 million pounds, far more than\r\nthe benefits to performers and recording studios. (In practice,\r\nthe report suggested, without changes in the law, most of the\r\nbenefits would not have gone to the original recording artist in\r\nany case.) It found prospective extension led to a clear social\r\nwelfare loss. What of retrospective extension?\r\n84\r\n\r\nThe report considered, and found wanting, arguments that\r\nretrospective extension is necessary to encourage \"media\r\nmigration\"--the digitization of existing works, for example. In\r\nfact, most studies have found precisely the reverse--that public\r\ndomain works are more available and more frequently adapted into\r\ndifferent media. (Look on Amazon.com for a classic work that is\r\nout of copyright--Moby-Dick, for example--and see how many\r\nadaptations and formats are available.) It also rejected the\r\nargument that harmonization alone was enough to justify\r\nextension--retrospective or prospective--pointing out the\r\nconsiderable actual variation in both term and scope of rights\r\nafforded to performers in different countries. Finally, it\r\nwarned of the \"hidden 'ratcheting' effect of harmonisation which\r\nresults from the fact that harmonisation is almost invariably\r\nupwards.\" Its conclusion was simple:\r\n85\r\n\r\n    [R]etrospective term extensions reduce social welfare. Thus,\r\nin this case, it would seem that basic theory alone is\r\nsufficient to provide strong, and unambiguous, guidance for\r\npolicy-makers. . . . We therefore see no reason to quarrel with\r\nthe consensus of the profession on this issue which as summed up\r\nby Akerlof et al. . . . [states] categorically that . . .\r\n\"[retrospective] extension provides essentially no incentive to\r\ncreate new works. Once a work is created, additional\r\ncompensation to the producer is simply a windfall.\"13\r\n86\r\n\r\nThe Gowers Review agreed. Its fourth recommendation read simply,\r\n\"Policy makers should adopt the principle that the term and\r\nscope of protection for IP rights should not be altered\r\nretrospectively.\" Perhaps more important, though, was the simple\r\nparagraph at the front of the document captioned \"The Approach\r\nof the Review.\" It begins thus: \"The Review takes an evidence-\r\nbased approach to its policy analysis and has supplemented\r\ninternal analysis by commissioning external experts to examine\r\nthe economic impact of changes. . . .\"\r\n87\r\n\r\nWhy specify that one was taking an \"evidence-based\" approach? At\r\nfirst, the comment seems unnecessary. What other approach would\r\none take? Anecdotal? Astrological? But there is a framework in\r\nwhich empirical evidence of the effects of policy simply seems\r\nirrelevant--one based on natural right. When the Review was given\r\nto the House of Commons Select Committee on Culture, Media and\r\nSport, that frame of mind was much in evidence:\r\n88\r\n\r\n    The Gowers Review undertook an extensive analysis of the\r\nargument for extending the term. On economic grounds, the Review\r\nconcluded that there was little evidence that extension would\r\nbenefit performers, increase the number of works created or made\r\navailable, or provide incentives for creativity; and it noted a\r\npotentially negative effect on the balance of trade. . . .\r\nGowers's analysis was thorough and in economic terms may be\r\ncorrect. It gives the impression, however, of having been\r\nconducted entirely on economic grounds. We strongly believe that\r\ncopyright represents a moral right of a creator to choose to\r\nretain ownership and control of their own intellectual property.\r\nWe have not heard a convincing reason why a composer and his or\r\nher heirs should benefit from a term of copyright which extends\r\nfor lifetime and beyond, but a performer should not. . . . Given\r\nthe strength and importance of the creative industries in the\r\nU.K., it seems extraordinary that the protection of intellectual\r\nproperty rights should be weaker here than in many other\r\ncountries whose creative industries are less successful.14\r\n89\r\n\r\nA couple of things are worth noting here. The first is that the\r\nCommittee is quite prepared to believe that the effects of term\r\nextension would not benefit performers or provide incentives for\r\ncreativity, and even to believe that it would hurt the balance\r\nof trade. The second is the curious argument in the last\r\nsentence. Other countries have stronger systems of rights and\r\nare less successful. We should change our regime to be more like\r\nthem! Obviously the idea that a country's creative industries\r\nmight be less successful because their systems of rights were\r\nstronger does not occur to the Committee for a moment. Though it\r\nproclaims itself to be unaffected by economic thought, it is in\r\nfact deeply influenced by the \"more rights equals more\r\ninnovation\" ideology of maximalism that I have described in\r\nthese pages.\r\n90\r\n\r\nNestling between these two apparently contradictory ideas is a\r\nserious argument that needs to be confronted. Should we ignore\r\nevidence--even conclusive evidence--of negative economic effects,\r\nharm to consumers, and consequences for the availability of\r\nculture because we are dealing with an issue of moral right,\r\nalmost natural right? Must we extend the rights of the artists\r\nwho recorded those songs (or rather the record companies who\r\nimmediately acquired their copyrights) because they are simply\r\ntheirs as a matter of natural justice? Do performers have a\r\nnatural right to recorded songs either because they have labored\r\non them, mixing their sweat with each track, or because\r\nsomething of their personality is forever stamped into the song?\r\nMust we grant an additional forty-five years of commercial\r\nexclusivity, not because of economic incentive, but because of\r\nnatural right?\r\n91\r\n\r\nMost of us feel the pull of this argument. I certainly do. But\r\nas I pointed out in Chapter 2, there are considerable problems\r\nwith such an idea. First, it runs against the premises of actual\r\ncopyright systems. In the United States, for example, the\r\nConstitution resolutely presents the opposite picture. Exclusive\r\nrights are to encourage progress in science and the useful arts.\r\nThe Supreme Court has elaborated on this point many times,\r\nrejecting both labor-based \"sweat of the brow\" theories of\r\ncopyright and more expansive visions based on a natural right to\r\nthe products of one's genius--whether inventions or novels.\r\nBritain, too, has a history of looking to copyright as a\r\nutilitarian scheme--though with more reference to, and legal\r\nprotection of, particular \"moral rights\" than one finds in the\r\nUnited States. But even in the most expansive \"moral rights\"\r\nlegal systems, even in the early days of debate about the rights\r\nof authors after the French Revolution, it is accepted that\r\nthere are temporal limits on these rights. If this is true of\r\nauthors, it is even more true of performers, who are not granted\r\nthe full suite of author's rights in moral rights jurisdictions,\r\nbeing exiled to a form of protection called \"neighboring\"\r\nrights.\r\n92\r\n\r\nIn all of these schemes, there are time limits on the length of\r\nthe rights (and frequently different ones for different\r\ncreators--authors, inventors, performers, and so on). Once one\r\nhas accepted that point, the question of how long they should be\r\nis, surely, a matter for empirical and utilitarian analysis. One\r\ncannot credibly say that natural rights or the deep\r\ndeontological structure of the universe gives me a right to\r\ntwenty-eight or fifty-six or seventy years of exclusivity. The\r\nargument must turn instead to a question of consequences. Which\r\nlimit is better? Once one asks that question, the Gowers\r\nReview's economic assessment is overwhelming, as the Select\r\nCommittee itself recognized. In the end, the government\r\nagreed--noting that a European Union study had found precisely\r\nthe same thing. The sound recording right should not be\r\nextended, still less extended retrospectively. The evidence-free\r\nzone had been penetrated. But not for long. As this book went to\r\npress, the European Commission announced its support for an even\r\nlonger Europe-wide extension of the sound recording right. The\r\ncontrary arguments and empirical evidence were ignored,\r\nminimized, explained away. How can this pattern be broken?\r\n93\r\n\r\nIn the next and final chapter, I try to answer that question. I\r\noffer a partial explanation for the cognitive and organizational\r\nblindnesses that have brought us to this point. I argue that we\r\nhave much to learn from the history, theory, and organizational\r\npractices of the environmental movement. The environmental\r\nmovement taught us to see \"the environment\" for the first time,\r\nto recognize its importance, and to change the way we thought\r\nabout ecology, property, and economics in consequence. What we\r\nneed is an environmentalism of mind, of culture, of information.\r\nIn the words of my colleague David Lange, we need to \"recognize\r\nthe public domain.\" And to save it.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 10: An Environmentalism for Information\r\n1\r\n\r\nOver the last fifteen years, a group of scholars have finally\r\npersuaded economists to believe something noneconomists find\r\nobvious: \"behavioral economics\" shows that people do not act as\r\neconomic theory predicts. But hold your cheers. This is not a\r\nvindication of folk wisdom over the pointy-heads. The deviations\r\nfrom \"rational behavior\" are not the wonderful cornucopia of\r\nhuman motivations you might imagine. There are patterns. For\r\nexample, we are systematically likely to overestimate chances of\r\nloss and underestimate chances of gain, to rely on simplifying\r\nheuristics to frame problems even when those heuristics are\r\ncontradicted by the facts.\r\n2\r\n\r\nSome of the patterns are endearing; the supposedly \"irrational\"\r\nconcerns for distributive equality that persist in all but the\r\neconomically trained and the extreme right, for example. But\r\nmost of them simply involve the mapping of cognitive bias. We\r\ncan take advantage of those biases, as those who sell us\r\nludicrously expensive and irrational warranties on consumer\r\ngoods do. Or we can correct for them, like a pilot who is\r\ntrained to rely on his instruments rather than his faulty\r\nperceptions when flying in heavy cloud.\r\n3\r\n\r\nThis book has introduced you to the wonders and terrors of\r\nintellectual property law--the range wars of the Internet age.\r\nThere have been discussions of synthetic biology and musical\r\nsampling, digital locks and the hackers who break them,\r\nJefferson and Macaulay, and the fight over video recorders. Now\r\nit is time to sum up.\r\n4\r\n\r\nI would argue that the chapters in this book present evidence of\r\nanother kind of cognitive bias, one that the behavioral\r\neconomists have not yet identified. Call it the openness\r\naversion. Cultural agoraphobia. We are systematically likely to\r\nundervalue the importance, viability, and productive power of\r\nopen systems, open networks, and nonproprietary production.\r\n5\r\n\r\nCULTURAL AGORAPHOBIA?\r\n6\r\n\r\nTest yourself on the following questions. In each case, it is\r\n1991 and I have removed from you all knowledge of the years\r\nsince then. (For some, this might be a relief.)\r\n7\r\n\r\nThe first question is a thought experiment I introduced in\r\nChapter 4. You have to design an international computer network.\r\nOne group of scientists describes a system that is fundamentally\r\nopen: open protocols and open systems so that anyone could\r\nconnect to the system and offer information or products to the\r\nworld. Another group--scholars, businesspeople,\r\nbureaucrats--points out the problems. Anyone could connect to the\r\nsystem! They could do anything! The system itself would not\r\nlimit them to a few approved actions or approved connections.\r\nThere would be porn, and piracy, and viruses, and spam.\r\nTerrorists could put up videos glorifying themselves. Your\r\nneighbor's site could compete with the New York Times or the\r\nU.S. government in documenting the war in Iraq. Better to have a\r\nwell-managed system in which official approval is required to\r\nput up a site, where only a few selected actions are permitted\r\nby the network protocols, where most of us are merely recipients\r\nof information, where spam, viruses, and piracy (and innovation\r\nand participatory culture and anonymous speech) are impossible.\r\nWhich network design would you have picked? Remember, you have\r\nno experience of blogs, or mashups, or Google; no experience of\r\nthe Web. Just you and your cognitive filters.\r\n8\r\n\r\nImagine a form of software which anyone could copy and change,\r\ncreated under a license which required subsequent programmers to\r\noffer their software on the same terms. Imagine legions of\r\nprogrammers worldwide contributing their creations back into a\r\n\"commons.\" Is this anarchic-sounding method of production\r\neconomically viable? Could it successfully compete with the\r\nhierarchically organized corporations producing proprietary,\r\nclosed code, controlled by both law and technology? Be truthful.\r\n9\r\n\r\nFinally, set yourself the task of producing the greatest\r\nreference work the world has ever seen. You are told that it\r\nmust cover everything from the best Thai food in Durham to the\r\nannual rice production of Thailand, from the best places to see\r\nblue whales to the history of the Blue Dog Coalition. Would you\r\ncreate a massive organization of paid experts, each assigned a\r\ntopic, with hierarchical layers of editors above them, producing\r\na set of encyclopedic tomes that are rigorously controlled by\r\ncopyright and trademark? Or would you wait for hobbyists,\r\ngovernments, scientists, and volunteer encyclopedists to\r\nproduce, and search engines to organize and rank, a cornucopia\r\nof information? I know which way I would have bet in 1991. But I\r\nalso know that the last time I consulted an encyclopedia was in\r\n1998. You?\r\n10\r\n\r\nIt is not that openness is always right. It is not. Often we\r\nneed strong intellectual property rights, privacy controls, and\r\nnetworks that demand authentication. Rather, it is that we need\r\na balance between open and closed, owned and free, and we are\r\nsystematically likely to get the balance wrong. (How did you do\r\non the test?) Partly this is because we still don't understand\r\nthe kind of property that lives on networks; most of our\r\nexperience is with tangible property. Sandwiches that one\r\nhundred people cannot share. Fields that can be overgrazed if\r\noutsiders cannot be excluded. For that kind of property, control\r\nmakes more sense. Like astronauts brought up in gravity, our\r\nreflexes are poorly suited for free fall. Jefferson's words were\r\ntrue even of grain elevators and hopper-boys. But in our world,\r\nthe proportion of intangible to tangible property is much, much\r\nhigher. The tendency to conflate intellectual and real property\r\nis even more dangerous in a networked world. We need his words\r\nmore than he did.\r\n11\r\n\r\nEach of the questions I asked is related to the World Wide Web.\r\nNot the Internet, the collective name for the whole phenomenon,\r\nincluding the underlying methods of sending and receiving\r\npackets. Some version of the underlying network has been around\r\nfor much longer, in one form or another. But it only attracted\r\npopular attention, only revolutionized the world, when on top of\r\nit was built the World Wide Web--the network of protocols and\r\npages and hyperlinks that is so much a part of our lives and\r\nwhich arose only from Tim Berners-Lee's work at CERN in 1991.\r\n12\r\n\r\nMy daughter will graduate from college in the year 2011. (At\r\nleast, we both hope so.) She is older than the Web. It will not\r\neven have had its twentieth birthday on her graduation day. By\r\nChristmas of 2012, it will be able to drink legally in the\r\nUnited States. I wrote those sentences, but I find it hard to\r\nbelieve them myself. A life without the Web is easy to remember\r\nand yet hard to recapture fully. It seems like such a natural\r\npart of our world, too fixed to have been such a recent arrival,\r\nas if someone suggested that all the roads and buildings around\r\nyou had arrived in the last fifteen years.\r\n13\r\n\r\nSome of you may find these words inexplicable because you live\r\nin a happy, Thoreau-like bliss, free of any contact with\r\ncomputer networks. If so, I take my hat off to you. The world of\r\nopen sky and virtuous sweat, of books and sport and laughter, is\r\nno less dear to me than to you. Having an avatar in a virtual\r\nworld holds the same interest as elective dental surgery. I care\r\nabout the Web not because I want to live my life there, but\r\nbecause of what it has allowed us to achieve, what it represents\r\nfor the potential of open science and culture. That, I think, is\r\nsomething that Thoreau (and even Emerson for that matter) might\r\nhave cared about deeply. Yet, as I suggested earlier in this\r\nbook, I seriously doubt that we would create the Web today--at\r\nleast if policy makers and market incumbents understood what the\r\ntechnology might become early enough to stop it.\r\n14\r\n\r\nI am not postulating some sinister \"Breakages, Limited\" that\r\nstifles technological innovation. I am merely pointing out the\r\nimbalance between our intuitive perceptions of the virtues and\r\ndangers of open and closed systems, an imbalance I share, quite\r\nfrankly.\r\n15\r\n\r\nIn place of what we have today, I think we would try, indeed we\r\nare trying, to reinvent a tamer, more controlled Web and to\r\nchange the nature of the underlying network on which it\r\noperates. (This is a fear I share with those who have written\r\nabout it more eloquently than I, particularly Larry Lessig and\r\nYochai Benkler.) We would restrict openness of access, decrease\r\nanonymity, and limit the number of actions that a network\r\nparticipant could perform. The benefits would be undeniable. It\r\nwould cut down on spam, viruses, and illicit peer-to-peer file\r\nsharing. At the same time, it would undercut the iconoclastic\r\ntechnological, cultural, and political potential that the Web\r\noffers, the ability of a new technology, a new service to build\r\non open networks and open protocols, without needing approval\r\nfrom regulators or entrenched market players, or even the owners\r\nof the Web pages to which you link.\r\n16\r\n\r\nImagine, by contrast, an Internet and a World Wide Web that\r\nlooked like America Online, circa 1996, or Compuserve, or the\r\nFrench state network Minitel. True, your exposure to penis-\r\nenhancement techniques, misspelled stock tips, and the penniless\r\nsons of Nigerian oil ministers would be reduced. That sounds\r\npretty attractive. But the idea that the AOL search engine would\r\nbe replaced by Yahoo and then Google, let alone Google Maps?\r\nThat new forms of instant messaging would displace Compuserve's\r\ne-mail? That the Chinese dissident would have access to\r\nanonymized Internet services, that you might make phone calls\r\nworldwide for free from your computer, or that a blog like\r\nBoingBoing would end up having more page views than many major\r\nnewspapers? Forget it. Goodbye to the radical idea that anyone\r\ncan link to any page on the network without permission. A\r\nrevised network could have the opposite rule and even impose it\r\nby default.\r\n17\r\n\r\nA tamer network could keep much tighter control over content,\r\nparticularly copyrighted content. You might still get the video\r\nof the gentlemen doing strange things with Mentos and soda\r\nbottles, though not its viral method of distribution. But forget\r\nabout \"George Bush Doesn't Care About Black People\" and all your\r\nfavorite mashups. Its controlled network of links and its\r\nlimited access would never unleash the collective fact-gathering\r\ngenius the Web has shown. For a fee, you would have Microsoft\r\nEncarta and the Encyclopedia Britannica online. What about the\r\n\"right-click universe\" of knowledge about the world gathered by\r\nstrangers, shared on comparatively open sites worldwide, and\r\nordered by search engines? What about Wikipedia? I think not.\r\n18\r\n\r\nThe counterfactual I offer is not merely a counterfactual. Yes,\r\nwe got the Web. It spread too fast to think of taming it into\r\nthe more mature, sedate \"National Information Infrastructure\"\r\nthat the Clinton administration imagined. But as Larry Lessig\r\npointed out years ago, the nature of a network can always be\r\nchanged. The war over the control and design of the network, and\r\nthe networked computer, is never-ending. As I write these words,\r\nthe battles are over \"trusted computing\" and \"Net neutrality.\"\r\nTrusted computing is a feature built into the operating system\r\nwhich makes it impossible to run processes that have not been\r\napproved by some outside body and digitally identified. It would\r\nindeed help to safeguard your computer from viruses and other\r\nthreats and make it harder to copy material the content owners\r\ndid not want you to copy (perhaps even if you had a right to).\r\nIn the process it would help to lock in the power of those who\r\nhad a dominant position in operating systems and popular\r\nprograms. (Microsoft is a big supporter.) It would make open\r\nsource software, which allows users to modify programs,\r\ninherently suspect. It would, in fact, as Jonathan Zittrain\r\npoints out, change the nature of the general-purpose computer,\r\nwhich you can program to do anything, back toward the terminal\r\nwhich tells you what functions are allowed.1 Think of a DVD\r\nplayer.\r\n19\r\n\r\nThe attack on Net neutrality, by contrast, is an attempt by the\r\ncompanies who own the networks to be allowed to discriminate\r\nbetween favored and disfavored content, giving the former\r\npreferential access. (One wit analogized it to letting the phone\r\ncompany say, \"we will delay your call to Pizza Hut for sixty\r\nseconds, but if you want to be put through to our featured pizza\r\nprovider immediately, hit nine now!\") Taken together, these\r\nproposals would put the control of the computer back in the\r\nhands of the owners of the content and the operating system, and\r\ncontrol of the network users' choices in the hands of the person\r\nwho sells them their bandwidth. At the same time, our\r\nintellectual property agenda is filled with proposals to create\r\nnew intellectual property rights or extend old ones. That is the\r\nopenness aversion in action.\r\n20\r\n\r\nNow, perhaps to you, the closed alternatives still sound better.\r\nPerhaps you do not care as much about the kind of technological\r\ndynamism, or anonymous speech, or cultural ferment that thrills\r\nthe digerati. Perhaps you care more about the risks posed by the\r\nunderlying freedom. That is a perfectly reasonable point of\r\nview. After all, openness does present real dangers; the same\r\nfreedom given to the innovator, the artist, and the dissident is\r\ngiven to the predator and the criminal. At each moment in\r\nhistory when we have opened a communications network, or the\r\nfranchise, or literacy, reasonable people have worried about the\r\nconsequences that might ensue. Would expanded literacy lead to a\r\ngeneral coarsening of the literary imagination? (Sometimes,\r\nperhaps. But it would and did lead to much more besides, to\r\nliterature and culture of which we could not have dreamed.)\r\nWould an expanded franchise put the control of the state into\r\nthe hands of the uneducated? (Yes, unless we had free national\r\neducational systems. \"Now we must educate our masters\" was the\r\nslogan of the educational reformers after the enlargement of the\r\nfranchise in Britain in the nineteenth century. Openness\r\nsometimes begets openness.) Would translating the Bible from\r\nLatin into the vernacular open the door to unorthodox and\r\nheretical interpretations, to a congregation straying because\r\nthey did not need to depend on a priestly intermediary with\r\nprivileged access to the text? (Oh, yes indeed.) Would TV and\r\nradio play into the hands of demagogues? (Yes, and help expose\r\ntheir misdeeds.)\r\n21\r\n\r\nOpenness is not always right. Far from it. But our prior\r\nexperience seems to be that we are systematically better at\r\nseeing its dangers than its benefits. This book has been an\r\nattempt, in the sphere of intellectual property, to help us\r\ncounteract that bias. Like the pilot in the cloud looking at his\r\ninstruments, we might learn that we are upside down. But what do\r\nwe do about it?\r\n22\r\n\r\nLEARNING FROM ENVIRONMENTALISM\r\n23\r\n\r\nI have argued that our policies are distorted not merely by\r\nindustry capture or the power of incumbent firms, but by a\r\nseries of cultural and economic biases or presuppositions: the\r\nequation of intellectual property to physical property; the\r\nassumption that whenever value is created, an intellectual\r\nproperty right should follow; the romantic idea of creativity\r\nthat needs no raw material from which to build; the habit of\r\nconsidering the threats, but not the benefits, of new\r\ntechnologies; the notion that more rights will automatically\r\nbring more innovation; the failure to realize that the public\r\ndomain is a vital contributor to innovation and culture; and a\r\ntendency to see the dangers of openness, but not its potential\r\nbenefits.2\r\n24\r\n\r\nOne of the most stunning pieces of evidence to our aversion to\r\nopenness is that, for the last fifty years, whenever there has\r\nbeen a change in the law, it has almost always been to expand\r\nintellectual property rights. (Remember, this implies that every\r\nsignificant change in technology, society, or economy required\r\nmore rights, never less, nor even the same amount.) We have done\r\nall this almost entirely in the absence of empirical evidence,\r\nand without empirical reconsideration to see if our policies\r\nwere working. As I pointed out in the last chapter, intellectual\r\nproperty policy is an \"evidence-free zone.\" It runs on faith\r\nalone and its faith consists of the cluster of ideas I have\r\noutlined in this book. Whether we call this cluster of ideas\r\nmaximalism, cultural agoraphobia, or the openness aversion, it\r\nexercises a profound influence on our intellectual property and\r\ncommunications policy.\r\n25\r\n\r\nThese ideas are not free-floating. They exist within, are\r\ninfluenced by, and in turn influence, a political economy. The\r\npolitical economy matters and it will shape any viable response.\r\nEven if the costs of getting the policies wrong are huge and\r\nunnecessary--think of the costs of the copyright extensions that\r\nlock up most of twentieth-century culture in order to protect\r\nthe tiny fraction of it that is still commercially\r\navailable--they are spread out over the entire population, while\r\nthe benefits accrue to a small group of commercial entities that\r\ndeeply and sincerely believe in the maximalist creed. This\r\npattern of diffuse but large losses and concentrated gains is,\r\nas Mancur Olson taught us, a recipe for political malfunction.3\r\nYet the problem is even deeper than that--in four ways.\r\n26\r\n\r\nFirst, though intellectual property rules will profoundly shape\r\nscience, culture, and the market in the information age, they\r\njust seem obscure, wonkish, hard to get excited about.\r\nCertainly, people can get upset about individual\r\nexamples--overbroad patents on human genes, copyright lawsuits\r\nagainst whistleblowers who leak e-mails showing corporate\r\nmisdeeds that threaten the integrity of electronic voting, rules\r\nthat paralyze documentary filmmakers, or require payment for\r\nsampling three notes from a prior song, extensions of rights\r\nthat allow patents on auctions or business methods, make genres\r\nsuch as jazz seem legally problematic, create new rights over\r\nfacts, or snarl up foundational technologies. But they see each\r\nof these as an isolated malfunction, not part of a larger social\r\nproblem or set of attitudes.\r\n27\r\n\r\nSecond, what holds true for issues, also holds true for\r\ncommunities. What links the person writing open source software,\r\nand trying to negotiate a sea of software patents in the\r\nprocess, to the film archivist trying to stir up interest in all\r\nthe wonderful \"orphan films\"--still under copyright but with no\r\ncopyright owner we can find--before they molder away into nitrate\r\ndust? When a university collaborates with Google to digitize\r\nbooks in their collection for the purposes of search and\r\nretrieval, even if only a tiny portion of the text will be\r\nvisible for any work still under copyright, does it sense any\r\ncommon interest with the synthetic biologist trying to create\r\nthe BioBricks Foundation, to keep open the foundational elements\r\nof a new scientific field? Both may be sued for their\r\nefforts--one connection at least.\r\n28\r\n\r\nWhen a developing nation tries to make use of the explicit\r\n\"flexibilities\" built into international trade agreements so as\r\nto make available a life-saving drug to its population through a\r\nprocess of compulsory licensing and compensation, it will find\r\nitself pilloried as a lawbreaker--though it is not--or punished\r\nthrough bilateral agreements. Will that process form any common\r\ninterest with the high-technology industries in the United\r\nStates who chafe at the way that current intellectual property\r\nrules enshrine older technologies and business methods and give\r\nthem the protection of law? There are some links between those\r\ntwo situations. Will the parties see those links, or will the\r\ndeveloping world's negotiators think that the current\r\nintellectual property rules express some monolithic \"Western\"\r\nset of interests? Will the high-tech companies think this is\r\njust an issue of dumb lawyers failing to understand technology?\r\nEach gap in understanding of common interest is a strike against\r\nan effective response.\r\n29\r\n\r\nThird, an effective political response would actually be easier\r\nif our current rules came merely from the relentless pursuit of\r\ncorporate self-interest. (Here I part company with those who\r\nbelieve that self-interest is simply \"there\"--not shaped by\r\nsocially constructed ideas, attitudes, ideologies, or biases.)\r\nIn fact, the openness aversion sometimes obscures self-interest\r\nas well as the public interest. Think of the relentless\r\ninsistence of the movie companies on making video recorders\r\nillegal. Nor does the framework of maximalism help if our goal\r\nis to have all the interested economic actors in the room when\r\npolicy is made. For example, by framing issues of communications\r\npolicy or Internet regulation as questions of intellectual\r\nproperty, we automatically privilege one set of interested\r\nparties--content owners--over others who also have a large\r\neconomic stake in the matter.\r\n30\r\n\r\nFourth, and finally, the biggest problem is that even if one\r\ncould overcome the problems of political interest, or\r\nideological closed-mindedness, the answers to many of these\r\nquestions require balance, thought, and empirical evidence--all\r\nqualities markedly missing in the debate. If the answer were\r\nthat intellectual property rights are bad, then forming good\r\npolicy would be easy. But that is as silly and one-sided an idea\r\nas the maximalist one I have been criticizing here. Here are\r\nthree examples:\r\n31\r\n\r\n1. Drug patents do help produce drugs. Jettisoning them is a bad\r\nidea--though experimenting with additional and alternative\r\nmethods of encouraging medical innovation is a very good one.\r\n\r\n2. I believe copyrights over literary works should be shorter,\r\nand that one should have to renew them after twenty-eight\r\nyears--something that about 85 percent of authors and publishers\r\nwill not do, if prior history is anything to go by. I think that\r\nwould give ample incentives to write and distribute books, and\r\ngive us a richer, more accessible culture and educational system\r\nto boot, a Library of Congress where you truly can \"click to get\r\nthe book\" as my son asked me to do years ago now. But that does\r\nnot mean that I wish to abolish copyright. On the contrary, I\r\nthink it is an excellent system.\r\n\r\n3. All the empirical evidence shows that protecting compilations\r\nof facts, as the European Database Directive does, has been a\r\nprofound failure as a policy, imposing costs on consumers\r\nwithout encouraging new database production. But if the evidence\r\nsaid the opposite, I would support a new database right.\r\n32\r\n\r\nWe need a political debate about intellectual property that\r\nrecognizes these trade-offs; that does not impose simplistic,\r\none-sided solutions; that looks to evidence. We need to\r\nunderstand the delicate and subtle balance between property and\r\nthe opposite of property, the role of rights, but also of the\r\npublic domain and the commons. Building a theory, let alone a\r\nmovement, around such an issue is hard. Doing so when we lack\r\nsome of the basic theoretical tools and vocabularies is\r\ndaunting. We do not even have a robust conception of the public\r\ndomain. If they think of it as a legal issue at all, people\r\nsimply think of it as whatever is left over after an endless\r\nseries of rights have been carved out. Can one build a politics\r\nto protect a residue?\r\n33\r\n\r\nSo we have at least four problems: an issue that is perceived as\r\nobscure, affecting scattered groups with little knowledge of\r\neach other's interest, dominated by an ideology that is\r\ngenuinely believed by its adherents, in the place of which we\r\nhave to make careful, balanced, empirically grounded\r\nsuggestions. Assume for a moment the need for a politics of\r\nintellectual property that seeks a solution to these four\r\nproblems. What might such a politics look like?\r\n34\r\n\r\nI have argued that in a number of respects, the politics of\r\nintellectual property and the public domain is at the stage that\r\nthe American environmental movement was at in the 1950s. In\r\n1950, there were people who cared strongly about issues we would\r\nnow identify as \"environmental\"--supporters of the park system\r\nand birdwatchers, but also hunters and those who disdained\r\nchemical pesticides in growing their foods. In the world of\r\nintellectual property, we have start-up software engineers,\r\nlibraries, appropriationist artists, parodists, biographers, and\r\nbiotech researchers. In the 50s and 60s, we had flurries of\r\noutrage over particular crises--burning rivers, oil spills,\r\ndreadful smog. In the world of intellectual property, we have\r\nthe kind of stories I have tried to tell here. Lacking, however,\r\nis a general framework, a perception of common interest in\r\napparently disparate situations.\r\n35\r\n\r\nCrudely speaking, the environmental movement was deeply\r\ninfluenced by two basic analytical frameworks. The first was the\r\nidea of ecology: the fragile, complex, and unpredictable\r\ninterconnections between living systems. The second was the idea\r\nof welfare economics--the ways in which markets can fail to make\r\nactivities internalize their full costs.4 The combination of the\r\ntwo ideas yielded a powerful and disturbing conclusion. Markets\r\nwould routinely fail to make activities internalize their own\r\ncosts, particularly their own environmental costs. This failure\r\nwould, routinely, disrupt or destroy fragile ecological systems,\r\nwith unpredictable, ugly, dangerous, and possibly irreparable\r\nconsequences. These two types of analysis pointed to a general\r\ninterest in environmental protection and thus helped to build a\r\nlarge constituency which supported governmental efforts to that\r\nend. The duck hunter's preservation of wetlands as a species\r\nhabitat turns out to have wider functions in the prevention of\r\nerosion and the maintenance of water quality. The decision to\r\nburn coal rather than natural gas for power generation may have\r\nimpacts on everything from forests to fisheries. The attempt to\r\nreduce greenhouse gases and mitigate the damage from global\r\nwarming cuts across every aspect of the economy.\r\n36\r\n\r\nOf course, it would be silly to think that environmental policy\r\nwas fueled only by ideas rather than more immediate desires. As\r\nWilliam Ruckelshaus put it, \"With air pollution there was, for\r\nexample, a desire of the people living in Denver to see the\r\nmountains again. Similarly, the people living in Los Angeles had\r\na desire to see one another.\" Funnily enough, as with\r\nintellectual property, changes in communications technology also\r\nplayed a role. \"In our living rooms in the middle sixties, black\r\nand white television went out and color television came in. We\r\nhave only begun to understand some of the impacts of television\r\non our lives, but certainly for the environmental movement it\r\nwas a bonanza. A yellow outfall flowing into a blue river does\r\nnot have anywhere near the impact on black and white television\r\nthat it has on color television; neither does brown smog against\r\na blue sky.\"5 More importantly perhaps, the technologically\r\nfueled deluge of information, whether from weather satellites or\r\ncomputer models running on supercomputers, provided some of the\r\nevidence that--eventually--started to build a consensus around the\r\nseriousness of global warming.\r\n37\r\n\r\nDespite the importance of these other factors, the ideas I\r\nmentioned--ecology and welfare economics--were extremely important\r\nfor the environmental movement. They helped to provide its\r\nagenda, its rhetoric, and the perception of common interest\r\nunderneath its coalition politics. Even more interestingly, for\r\nmy purposes, those ideas--which began as inaccessible scientific\r\nor economic concepts, far from popular discourse--were brought\r\ninto the mainstream of American politics. This did not happen\r\neasily or automatically. Popularizing complicated ideas is hard\r\nwork. There were popular books, television discussions,\r\ndocumentaries on Love Canal or the California kelp beds, op-ed\r\npieces in newspapers, and pontificating experts on TV.\r\nEnvironmental groups both shocking and staid played their part,\r\nthrough the dramatic theater of a Greenpeace protest or the\r\ntweedy respectability of the Audubon Society. Where once the\r\nidea of \"the Environment\" (as opposed to \"my lake,\" say) was\r\nseen as a mere abstraction, something that couldn't stand\r\nagainst the concrete benefits brought by a particular piece of\r\ndevelopment, it came to be an abstraction with both the force of\r\nlaw and of popular interest behind it.\r\n38\r\n\r\nTo me, this suggests a strategy for the future of the politics\r\nof intellectual property, a way to save our eroding public\r\ndomain. In both areas, we seem to have the same recipe for\r\nfailure in the structure of the decision-making process.\r\nDemocratic decisions are made badly when they are primarily made\r\nby and for the benefit of a few stakeholders, whether\r\nindustrialists or content providers. This effect is only\r\nintensified when the transaction costs of identifying and\r\nresisting the change are high. Think of the costs and benefits\r\nof acid rain-producing power generation or--less serious, but\r\nsurely similar in form--the costs and benefits of retrospectively\r\nincreasing copyright term limits on works for which the\r\ncopyright had already expired, pulling them back out of the\r\npublic domain. There are obvious benefits to the heirs and\r\nassigns of authors whose copyright has expired in having\r\nCongress put the fence back up around this portion of the\r\nintellectual commons. There are clearly some costs--for example,\r\nto education and public debate--in not having multiple, competing\r\nlow-cost editions of these works. But these costs are\r\nindividually small and have few obvious stakeholders to\r\nrepresent them.\r\n39\r\n\r\nYet, as I have tried to argue here, beyond the failures in the\r\ndecision-making process, lie failures in the way we think about\r\nthe issues. The environmental movement gained much of its\r\npersuasive power by pointing out that for structural reasons we\r\nwere likely to make bad environmental decisions: a legal system\r\nbased on a particular notion of what \"private property\" entailed\r\nand an engineering or scientific system that treated the world\r\nas a simple, linearly related set of causes and effects. In both\r\nof these conceptual systems, the environment actually\r\ndisappeared; there was no place for it in the analysis. Small\r\nsurprise, then, that we did not preserve it very well. I have\r\nargued that the same is true about the public domain. The\r\nconfusions against which the Jefferson Warning cautions, the\r\nsource-blindness of a model of property rights centered on an\r\n\"original author,\" and the political blindness to the importance\r\nof the public domain as a whole (not \"my lake,\" but \"the\r\nEnvironment\"), all come together to make the public domain\r\ndisappear, first in concept and then, increasingly, as a\r\nreality. To end this process we need a cultural\r\nenvironmentalism, an environmentalism of the mind, and over the\r\nlast ten years we have actually begun to build one.\r\n40\r\n\r\nCultural environmentalism is an idea, an intellectual and\r\npractical movement, that is intended to be a solution to a set\r\nof political and theoretical problems--an imbalance in the way we\r\nmake intellectual property policy, a legal regime that has\r\nadapted poorly to the transformation that technology has\r\nproduced in the scope of law, and, perhaps most importantly, a\r\nset of mental models, economic nostrums, and property theories\r\nthat each have a public domain-shaped hole at their center.\r\n41\r\n\r\nThe comparison I drew between the history of environmentalism\r\nand the state of intellectual property policy had a number of\r\nfacets. The environmental movement had \"invented\" the concept of\r\nthe environment and used it to tie together a set of phenomena\r\nthat would otherwise seem very separate. In doing so, it changed\r\nperceptions of self-interest and helped to form coalitions where\r\nnone had existed before--just as earth science built upon\r\nresearch into the fragile interconnections of ecology and on the\r\nPigouvian analysis of economic externalities. I argue that we\r\nneed to make visible the invisible contributions of the public\r\ndomain, the \"ecosystem services\" performed by the\r\nunderappreciated but nevertheless vital reservoir of freedom in\r\nculture and science.6 And, just as with environmentalism, we\r\nneed not only a semantic reorganization, or a set of conceptual\r\nand analytic tools, but a movement of people devoted to bringing\r\na goal to the attention of their fellow citizens.\r\n42\r\n\r\nI have tried hard to show that there is something larger going\r\non under the realpolitik of land grabs by Disney and campaign\r\ncontributions by the Recording Industry Association of America.\r\nBut it would be an equal and opposite mistake to think that this\r\nis just about a dysfunctional discourse of intellectual\r\nproperty. In this part of the analysis, too, the environmental\r\nmovement offers some useful practical reminders. The ideas of\r\necology and environmental welfare economics were important, but\r\none cannot merely write A Sand County Almanac and hope the world\r\nwill change. Environmentalists piggybacked on existing sources\r\nof conservationist sentiment--love of nature, the national parks\r\nmovement, hikers, campers, birdwatchers. They built coalitions\r\nbetween those who might be affected by environmental changes.\r\nThey even stretched their political base by discovering, albeit\r\ntoo slowly, the realities of environmental racism, on the one\r\nhand, and the benefits of market solutions to some environmental\r\nproblems on the other. Some of these aspects, at least, could be\r\nreplicated in the politics of intellectual property.\r\n43\r\n\r\nTen years ago, when I first offered the environmental analogy, I\r\nclaimed that intellectual property policy was seen as a contract\r\nstruck between industry groups--something technical, esoteric,\r\nand largely irrelevant to individual citizens, except in that\r\nthey were purchasers of the products that flowed out of the\r\nsystem. Whether or not that view has ever been tenable, it is\r\nnot so in a digital age. Instead, I offered the basic argument\r\nlaid out here--that we needed a \"politics of intellectual\r\nproperty\" modeled on the environmental movement to create a\r\ngenuine and informed political debate on intellectual property\r\npolicy.7\r\n44\r\n\r\nSo far, I have concentrated on the theoretical and academic\r\ntools such a debate would need--focusing particularly on property\r\ntheory and on economic analysis and its limits. But if there is\r\nto be a genuinely democratic politics of intellectual property,\r\nwe would need an institutional diversity in the policymaking\r\ndebate that was comparable to that of the environmental\r\nmovement.\r\n45\r\n\r\nEnvironmentalism presents us with a remarkable diversity of\r\norganizational forms and missions. We have Greenpeace, the\r\nEnvironmental Legal Defense Fund, groups of concerned\r\nscientists, and the Audubon Society, each with its own methods,\r\ngroups of supporters, and sets of issues. Yet we also have local\r\nand pragmatic coalitions to save a particular bit of green\r\nspace, using the private tools of covenants and contracts.8 I\r\nthink we can see the beginnings of the replication of that\r\ninstitutional diversity in the world of intangible property.\r\n46\r\n\r\nTen years ago, civil society had little to offer in terms of\r\ngroups that represented anything other than an industry position\r\non intellectual property, still less ones that took seriously\r\nthe preservation of the public domain or the idea that\r\nintellectual property policy was a matter of balance, rather\r\nthan simple maximization of rights. There were the librarians\r\nand a few academics. That was about it. This position has\r\nchanged radically.\r\n47\r\n\r\nThere are academic centers that concentrate on the theoretical\r\nissues discussed in this book--one of them at my university.\r\nThanks in large part to the leadership of Pamela Samuelson,\r\nthere are law student clinics that do impact litigation on\r\nissues such as fair use and that represent underserved clients\r\nsuch as documentarians. But beyond academic work, there are\r\norganizations that have dedicated themselves to advocacy and to\r\nlitigation around the themes of preservation of the public\r\ndomain, defense of limitations and exceptions in copyright, and\r\nthe protection of free speech from the effects of intellectual\r\nproperty regulation of both content and the communications\r\ninfrastructure. The Electronic Frontier Foundation did exist ten\r\nyears ago, but its coverage of intellectual property issues was\r\nonly episodic. Its portfolio of litigation and public education\r\non the subject is now nothing short of remarkable. Public\r\nKnowledge's valuable lobbying and education is another obvious\r\nexample. International organizations with similar aims include\r\nthe Open Rights Group in the United Kingdom.9\r\n48\r\n\r\nOrganizing has also taken place around particular cases--such as\r\nEldred v. Ashcroft, the challenge to the Sonny Bono Copyright\r\nTerm Extension Act.10 Activity is not confined to the world of\r\ncopyright. The Public Patent Foundation combats \"patent creep\"\r\nby exposing and challenging bad patents.11\r\n49\r\n\r\nIt would be remiss not to mention the international Access to\r\nKnowledge, or A2K, movement, inspired by the work of Jamie\r\nLove.12 While its focus is on the kinds of issues represented by\r\nthe access-to-medicines movement, it has made the idea of\r\nbalance in intellectual property and the protection of the\r\npublic domain one of its central components. Mr. Love himself is\r\nalso the central figure behind the idea of a Research and\r\nDevelopment Treaty which would amend international trade\r\nagreements to make intellectual property merely one of a whole\r\nrange of economic methods for stimulating innovation.13\r\nHis work has touched almost every single one of the movements\r\ndiscussed here.\r\n50\r\n\r\nThe Access to Knowledge movement has many institutional\r\nvariants. The Development Agenda at the World Intellectual\r\nProperty Organization (WIPO), put forward by India and Brazil,\r\nincludes similar themes, as do the Geneva Declaration and the\r\nAdelphi Charter produced by the United Kingdom's Royal Society\r\nfor the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce.14\r\nHistory is full of wordy charters and declarations, of course.\r\nBy themselves they mean little. Yet the level of public and\r\nmedia attention paid to them indicates that intellectual\r\nproperty policy is now of interest beyond a narrow group of\r\naffected industries. To underscore this point, several major\r\nfoundations have introduced intellectual property initiatives,\r\nsomething that would have been inconceivable ten years ago.15\r\n51\r\n\r\nFinally, to complete the analogy to the land trust, we have the\r\norganizations I mentioned earlier, such as Creative Commons and\r\nthe Free Software Foundation.16 The latter group pioneered\r\nwithin software the attempt to create a licensed \"commons\" in\r\nwhich freedoms are guaranteed. The licensed commons replaces the\r\nlaw's default rules with choices made by individuals, the\r\neffects of which are magnified by collective action. The end\r\nresult is a zone of public freedom enabled by private choice.\r\n52\r\n\r\nIf one looks at these institutions and actors and at the range\r\nof issues on which they focus--from software to drug patents,\r\nfrom reverse engineering to access to archival records--the\r\nobvious question is, how did they overcome the collective action\r\nproblem? What ties together a critique of digital locks and the\r\naccess-to-medicines movement? Again, I think the answer points\r\nto the usefulness of the environmental analogy. As I pointed\r\nout, the invention of the \"environment\" trope tied together\r\ngroups whose interests, considered at a lower level of\r\nabstraction, seemed entirely different--hunters and birdwatchers,\r\nantipollution protesters and conservation biologists. The idea\r\nof the \"environment\" literally created the self-interest or set\r\nof preferences that ties the movement together. The same is true\r\nhere. Apparently disparate interests are linked by ideas of the\r\nprotection of the public domain and of the importance of a\r\nbalance between protection and freedom in cultural and\r\nscientific ecology.17\r\n53\r\n\r\nBut even a broad range of initiatives and institutions would\r\nnot, in and of themselves, produce results. One must convince\r\npeople that one's arguments are good, one's institutional\r\ninnovations necessary, one's horror stories disturbing.\r\nEnvironmentalism has managed to win the battle for clarity--to\r\nmake its points clearly enough that they ceased to be dismissed\r\nas \"arcane\" or technical, to overcome neglect by the media, to\r\narticulate a set of concerns that are those of any educated\r\ncitizen. The other striking phenomenon of the last ten years is\r\nthe migration of intellectual property issues off the law\r\nreviews or business pages and onto the front pages and the\r\neditorial pages. Blogs have been particularly influential.\r\nWidely read sites such as Slashdot and Boing-Boing have multiple\r\npostings on intellectual property issues each day; some are\r\nrants, but others are at a level of sophistication that once\r\nwould have been confined to academic discussion.18 Scientists\r\npassionately debate the importance of open access to scholarly\r\njournals. Geographers and climatologists fume over access to\r\ngeospatial data. The movement has been pronounced enough to\r\ngenerate its own reaction. The popular comics site \"xkcd\" has\r\nstrips critical of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act,19\r\nbut also a nerdily idyllic picture of a stick figure reclining\r\nunder a tree and saying, \"Sometimes I just can't get outraged\r\nover copyright law.\"20 That cartoon now resides on my computer\r\ndesktop. (It is under a Creative Commons license, ironically\r\nenough.)\r\n54\r\n\r\nWho can blame the stick figure? Certainly not I. Is it not silly\r\nto equate the protection of the environment with the protection\r\nof the public domain? After all, one is the struggle to save a\r\nplanetary ecology and the other is just some silly argument\r\nabout legal rules and culture and science. I would be the first\r\nto yield primacy to the environmental challenges we are facing.\r\nMass extinction events are to be avoided, particularly if they\r\ninvolve you personally. Yet my willingness to minimize the\r\nimportance of the rules that determine who owns science and\r\nculture goes only so far.\r\n55\r\n\r\nA better intellectual property system will not save the planet.\r\nOn the other hand, one of the most promising sets of tools for\r\nbuilding biofuels comes from synthetic biology. Ask some of the\r\nleading scientists in that field why they devoted their precious\r\ntime to trying to work out a system that would offer the\r\nvaluable incentives that patents provide while leaving a commons\r\nof \"biobricks\" open to all for future development. I worry about\r\nthese rules naturally; they were forced to do so. A better\r\nintellectual property system certainly will not end world\r\nhunger. Still it is interesting to read about the lengthy\r\nstruggles to clear the multiple, overlapping patents on\r\nGoldenRiceTM--a rice grain genetically engineered to cure vitamin\r\ndeficiencies that nearly perished in a thicket of blurrily\r\noverlapping rights.21\r\n56\r\n\r\nA better intellectual property system will not cure AIDS or\r\nrheumatoid arthritis or Huntington's disease or malaria.\r\nCertainly not by itself. Patents have already played a positive\r\nrole in contributing to treatments for the first two, though\r\nthey are unlikely to help much on the latter two; the affected\r\npopulations are too few or too poor. But overly broad, or vague,\r\nor confusing patents could (and I believe have) hurt all of\r\nthose efforts--even those being pursued out of altruism. Those\r\nproblems could be mitigated. Reforms that made possible legal\r\nand facilitated distribution of patented medicines in Africa\r\nmight save millions of lives. They would cost drug companies\r\nlittle. Africa makes up 1.6 percent of their global market.\r\nInteresting alternative methods have even been suggested for\r\nencouraging investment in treatments for neglected diseases and\r\ndiseases of the world's poor. At the moment, we spend 90 percent\r\nof our research dollars on diseases that affect 10 percent of\r\nthe global population. Perhaps this is the best we can do, but\r\nwould it not be nice to have a vigorous public debate on the\r\nsubject? Some possible innovations are much easier. A simple\r\nrule that required the eventual free publication online of all\r\ngovernment-funded health research, under open licenses, rather\r\nthan its sequestration behind the paywalls of commercial\r\njournals, could help fuel remarkable innovations in scientific\r\nsynthesis and computer-aided research while giving citizens\r\naccess to the research for which they have already paid.\r\n57\r\n\r\nGood intellectual property policy will not save our culture. But\r\nbad policy may lock up our cultural heritage unnecessarily,\r\nleave it to molder in libraries, forbid citizens to digitize it,\r\neven though the vast majority of it will never be available\r\npublicly and no copyright owner can be found. Would you not\r\nprefer the world in which your children could look at the\r\nLibrary of Congress online catalogue and click to get the book\r\nor film or song that otherwise languished as an \"orphan work\"?\r\nGood intellectual policy will not necessarily give us great new\r\nmusic. But the policy we have today would make some of the music\r\nwe most cherish illegal, or at least legally questionable. Does\r\nthat inspire confidence for the future? As for the World Wide\r\nWeb, I offer again my thought experiment from the first part of\r\nthis chapter. Would we be more likely to invent it or forbid it\r\ntoday? We are certainly working busily to change the openness of\r\nthe general-purpose computer, the neutrality of the network, and\r\nthe degree of control that content companies can exert over\r\nhardware.\r\n58\r\n\r\nI do not claim that the issues I have written about here are the\r\nmost important problem the world faces. That would be\r\nridiculous. But I do claim that they are facets of a very\r\nimportant problem and one to which we are paying far too little\r\nattention.\r\n59\r\n\r\nI would also be the first to admit that these issues are\r\ncomplicated. Even if we heeded the precepts I have outlined in\r\nthis book, even if we actually started to look at intellectual\r\nproperty as an empirical question, even if we turned to data\r\nrather than faith for our assessments, reasonable people would\r\ndisagree about much. Some of the most ludicrous recent\r\nexcesses--huge retrospective copyright term extensions, database\r\nrights, proposed webcasting treaties, business method patents--do\r\nnot pass the laugh test, in my view and that of most scholars.\r\nStopping and then reversing that tide would be valuable, even\r\ntransformative, but other issues are a closer call.\r\n60\r\n\r\nIt is also true that we do not have all the tools we need. A lot\r\nremains to be done, both academically and practically. We need\r\nbetter evidence. We need property theories that give us as rich\r\na conception of property's outside--of the public domain and the\r\ncommons--as we have of property itself. We need to rethink some\r\nof our policies of international harmonization and reconsider\r\nwhat types of policy actually benefit the developing world. We\r\nshould explore ways of compensating artists that are very\r\ndifferent from the ones we use now, and study the use of\r\ndistributed creativity and open source in new areas of science\r\nand culture.\r\n61\r\n\r\nDifficulties aside, I have tried here to show that we need a\r\ncultural environmental movement, a politics that enables us\r\nfirst to see and then to preserve the public domain, to\r\nunderstand its contributions to our art, our technology, and our\r\nculture. Where is that movement now?\r\n62\r\n\r\nThere is cause for both concern and optimism. Concern, because\r\nit is still hard for courts, legislators, policy makers, and\r\ncitizens to see beyond the word \"property\" to the reality\r\nunderneath. I started this book with the question from my son\r\nabout the online catalogue of the Library of Congress: \"Where do\r\nyou click to get the book?\" In 2003 the Supreme Court heard\r\nEldred v. Ashcroft, the challenge to retrospective copyright\r\nterm extension. Over two strong dissents, the Court upheld the\r\nconstitutionality of the act against both First Amendment and\r\nCopyright Clause challenges. The dead had their copyrights\r\nextended yet again. The widest legal restriction of speech in\r\nthe history of the Republic--putting off-limits most twentieth-\r\ncentury books, poems, films, and songs for another twenty years\r\nwithout a corresponding speech benefit or incentive--can proceed\r\nwithout significant First Amendment review. Does such a decision\r\nmean the task this book undertakes--to take seriously the\r\ncontributions of the public domain to innovation, culture, and\r\nspeech--is ultimately doomed, whatever its intellectual merits,\r\nto face a hostile or uncomprehending audience? Admittedly,\r\nEldred focused specifically on two particular constitutional\r\nclaims. Still, the attitude of the majority toward the\r\nimportance of the public domain--whether in the textual\r\nlimitations on Congress's power or the application of the First\r\nAmendment--can hardly be cause for optimism. And yet . . . The\r\nmedia reaction was remarkable.\r\n63\r\n\r\nThe New York Times was sufficiently unfamiliar with the term\r\n\"public domain\" that it was not entirely sure whether or not to\r\nuse the definite article in front of it. But unfamiliarity did\r\nnot imply complacency. An editorial declared that this decision\r\n\"makes it likely that we are seeing the beginning of the end of\r\npublic domain and the birth of copyright perpetuity. Public\r\ndomain has been a grand experiment, one that should not be\r\nallowed to die. The ability to draw freely on the entire\r\ncreative output of humanity is one of the reasons we live in a\r\ntime of such fruitful creative ferment.\"22 The Washington Post,\r\nthough more inclined to agree that retrospective extension might\r\nbe constitutional, declared the copyright system to be \"broken\"\r\nin that it \"effectively and perpetually protects nearly all\r\nmaterial that anyone would want to cite or use. That's not what\r\nthe framers envisioned, and it's not in the public interest.\"23\r\n64\r\n\r\nI could not agree more. But as I have tried to show here, the\r\nprocess is not limited to copyright, or culture, or texts, or\r\nthe United States. Think of the stories about business method\r\npatents, or synthetic biology, or the regulation of musical\r\nborrowing on the atomic level. Think of the discussion of the\r\nopenness aversion that began this chapter. In the middle of the\r\nmost successful and exciting experiment in nonproprietary,\r\ndistributed creativity in the history of the species, our policy\r\nmakers can see only the threat from \"piracy.\" They act\r\naccordingly. Our second enclosure movement is well under way.\r\nThe poem with which I began Chapter 3 told us: \"And geese will\r\nstill a common lack / Till they go and steal it back.\" I cannot\r\nmatch the terseness or the rhyme, but if we assume that the\r\nenclosure of the commons of the mind will bring us prosperity,\r\ngreat science, and vibrant culture, well, we will look like very\r\nsilly geese indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\nNotes: Chapter 1\r\n\r\n1. As the suggested further reading indicates, this light-\r\nhearted account of the economic basis of intellectual property\r\nconceals considerable complexity. On the other hand, the\r\ncore argument is presented here--and a compelling argument it is.\r\n\r\n2.

Unfortunately, the reality turns out to be less rosy. James\r\nBessen, \"Patents and the Diffusion of Technical Information,\"\r\nEconomics Letters 86 (2005): 122: \"[S]urvey evidence suggests\r\nthat firms do not place much value on the disclosed information.\r\nMoreover, those firms that do read patents do not use them\r\nprimarily as a source of information on technology. Instead,\r\nthey use them for other purposes, such as keeping track of\r\ncompetitors or checking for infringement. There are, in fact,\r\nsound theoretical reasons why the disclosed information may not\r\nbe very valuable. [Fritz] Machlup and [Edith] Penrose report\r\nthat the argument about diffusion is an old one, popular since\r\nthe mid-19th century. They also point out that, at least through\r\nthe 1950s, economists have been skeptical about this argument.\r\nThe problem, also recognized in the mid-19th century, is that\r\n'only unconcealable inventions are patented,' so patents reveal\r\nlittle that could not be otherwise learned.

Tim O'Reilly points out that there are 32 million titles in\r\nthe Online Computer Library Center's \"WorldCat\" catalogue--this\r\nis a reasonable proxy for the number of books in U.S. libraries.\r\nNielsen's Bookscan shows that 1.2 million books sold at least\r\none copy in 2005. This yields a ratio of books commercially\r\navailable to books ever published of about 4 percent. But of\r\nthose 1.2 million books, many are in the public domain--think of\r\nShakespeare, Dickens, Austen, Melville, Kipling. Thus the\r\npercentage of books that are under copyright and commercially\r\navailable may actually be considerably lower than 4 percent.

The House bill, The Orphan Works\r\nAct of 2008, HR 5889, 110th Cong. (2008), is similar but not\r\nidentical.

Just a few weeks before he wrote to McPherson, he wrote\r\na letter to Jeremiah Goodman about a slave called Hercules who\r\nhad been imprisoned as a runaway. \"The folly he has committed\r\ncertainly justifies further punishment, and he goes in\r\nexpectation of receiving it. . . .\" Letter from Thomas Jefferson\r\nto Jeremiah A.

While leaving the\r\nmatter up to Goodman, Jefferson argues for leniency and for\r\nrefraining from further punishment. In that sense, it is a\r\nhumane letter. But this is one of the authors of the Declaration\r\nof Independence, full of glorious principles--unalienable rights;\r\nlife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness--enunciated in the\r\ncontext of indignation at relatively mild colonial policies of\r\ntaxation and legislation. How could a man who thought that\r\ntaxing tea was tyranny, and that all men had an unalienable\r\nright to liberty, believe that it was \"folly\" justifying\r\n\"further punishment\" for a slave to run away? Reading the\r\nletter--a curiously intimate, almost voyeuristic act--one finds\r\noneself saying \"What was he thinking?\"\r\n\r\n3. Letter to McPherson, 333.\r\n\r\n4.

Adam Mossoff, \"Who Cares What Thomas Jefferson Thought about\r\nPatents? Reevaluating the Patent 'Privilege' in Historical\r\nContext,\" Cornell Law Review 92 (2007): 953-1012. In a\r\nthoughtful, carefully reasoned, and provocative article,\r\nProfessor Mossoff argues that Jefferson's views have been\r\nmisused by the courts and legal historians, and that if we\r\nunderstand the use of the word \"privilege\" in historical\r\ncontext, we see that the \"patent privilege\" was influenced by a\r\nphilosophy of natural rights as well as the antimonopolist\r\nutilitarianism described here. I both agree and disagree.\r\n\r\nProfessor Mossoff 's central point--that the word \"privilege\" was\r\nnot understood by eighteenth-century audiences as the antonym of\r\n\"right\"--is surely correct. To lay great stress on the linguistic\r\npoint that the patent right is \"merely\" a \"privilege\" is to rest\r\none's argument on a weak reed. But this is not the only\r\nargument. One could also believe that intellectual property\r\nrights have vital conceptual and practical differences with\r\nproperty rights over tangible objects or land, that the framers\r\nof the Constitution who were most involved in the intellectual\r\nproperty clause were deeply opposed to the confusion involved in\r\nconflating the two, and that they looked upon this confusion\r\nparticularly harshly because of an intense concern about state\r\nmonopolies. One can still disagree with this assessment, of\r\ncourse; one can interpret Madison's words this way or that, or\r\ninterpret subsequent patent decisions as deep statements of\r\nprinciple or commonplace rhetorical flourishes. Still it seems\r\nto me a much stronger argument than the one based on the\r\nprivilege-right distinction. I am not sure Professor Mossoff\r\nwould disagree.\r\n\r\nProfessor Mossoff is also correct to point out that a \"legal\r\nprivilege\" did sometimes mean to an eighteenth-century reader\r\nsomething that the state was duty-bound to grant. There was, in\r\nfact, a wide range of sources from which an eighteenth-century\r\nlawyer could derive a state obligation to grant a privilege.\r\nEighteenth-century legal talk was a normative bouillabaisse--a\r\nrich stew of natural right, common law, utility, and\r\nprogress--often thrown together without regard to their\r\ndifferences. Some lawyers and judges thought the common law\r\nembodied natural rights, others that it represented the dictates\r\nof \"progress\" and \"utility,\" and others, more confusingly still,\r\nseemed to adopt all of those views at once.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I would agree that some eighteenth-century writers\r\nsaw claims of common-law right beneath the assertion of some\r\n\"privileges\" and that a smaller number of those assumed common-\r\nlaw right and natural right to be equivalent, and thus saw a\r\nstrong state obligation to grant a particular privilege based on\r\nnatural right, wherever that privilege had been recognized by\r\nEnglish or U.S. common law. But here is where I part company\r\nwith Professor Mossoff.\r\n\r\nFirst, I do not believe that the most important architects of\r\nthe intellectual property clause shared that view when it came\r\nto patents and copyrights. Jefferson, of course, was not one of\r\nthose who believed the state was so bound. \"Society may give an\r\nexclusive right to the profits arising from [inventions], as an\r\nencouragement to men to pursue ideas which may produce utility,\r\nbut this may or may not be done, according to the will and\r\nconvenience of the society, without claim or complaint from any\r\nbody\" (Letter to McPherson, 334, emphasis added). More\r\nimportantly, Jefferson's thinking about patents was infused by a\r\ndeeply utilitarian, antimonopolist tinge. So, I would argue, was\r\nMadison's.\r\n\r\nThe quotations from Madison which I give later show clearly, to\r\nme at least, that Madison shared Jefferson's deeply utilitarian\r\nattitude toward patent and copyright law. I think there is very\r\ngood reason to believe that this attitude was dominant among the\r\nScottish Enlightenment thinkers whose writings were so\r\ninfluential to the framers. I do not think it is an exaggeration\r\nto say that the American Revolution was violently against the\r\nworld of monopoly and corruption that was the supposed target of\r\nthe English Statute of Monopolies (itself hardly a natural\r\nrights document). Yes, those thinkers might fall back into\r\ntalking about how hard an inventor had worked or construing a\r\npatent expansively. Yes, they might think that within the\r\nboundaries of settled law, it would be unjust to deny one\r\ninventor a patent when the general scheme of patent law had\r\nalready been laid down. But that did not and does not negate the\r\nantimonopolist and, for that matter, utilitarian roots of the\r\nConstitution's intellectual property clause.\r\n\r\nSecond, while I agree that there were strands of natural right\r\nthinking and a labor theory of value in the U.S. intellectual\r\nproperty system, and that they continue to this day-- indeed,\r\nthese were the very views that the Feist decision discussed in\r\nChapter 9 repudiated, as late as 1991--I think it is easy to make\r\ntoo much of that fact. Is this signal or noise? There are\r\nconceptual reasons to think it is the latter. Later in this\r\nchapter I discuss the evolution of the droits d'auteur tradition\r\nin France. Here, at the supposed heart of the natural rights\r\ntradition, we find thinkers driven inexorably to consider the\r\nquestion of limits. How far does the supposed natural right\r\nextend--in time, in space, in subject matter? It is at that\r\nmoment that the utilitarian focus and the fear of monopoly\r\nrepresented by Jefferson and Madison--and, for that matter, Locke\r\nand Condorcet--become so important.\r\n\r\nProfessor Mossoff is correct to criticize the focus on the word\r\n\"privilege,\" and also correct that the ideas of natural right\r\nand the labor theory of value always color attitudes toward\r\nintellectual property claims. But it would be an equal and\r\nopposite mistake to ignore two points. First, intellectual\r\nproperty rights are profoundly different from physical property\r\nrights over land in ways that should definitively shape policy\r\nchoices. Second, partly because of those differences, and\r\nbecause of the influence of free-trade Scottish Enlightenment\r\nthought on the American Revolution in particular, there was a\r\npowerful antimonopolist and free-trade sentiment behind the\r\ncopyright and patent clause. Simply read the clause. Congress is\r\ngiven the power \"to promote the Progress of Science and useful\r\nArts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the\r\nexclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.\"\r\nDoes this really read like the work of a group of believers in\r\nnatural right? On the contrary, it reads like a limited grant of\r\npower to achieve a particular utilitarian goal. That sentiment--\r\nnicely encapsulated in but by no means limited to the words of\r\nJefferson--is still a good starting place for an understanding of\r\nintellectual property.\r\n\r\n20. See, e.g., Ochoa and Rose, \"Anti-Monopoly Origins,\" and\r\nEdward C. Walterscheid, The Nature of the Intellectual Property\r\nClause: A Study in Historical Perspective (Buffalo, N.Y.: W. S.\r\nHein, 2002). Ochoa, Rose, and Walterscheid stress the\r\nantimonopolist concerns that animated some of those who were\r\nmost active in the debates about intellectual property. They\r\nalso point out the influence of the English Statute of\r\nMonopolies of 1623, which attacked monopolies in general, while\r\nmaking an exception for periods of legal exclusivity for a\r\nlimited time granted over \"sole Working or Making of any Manner\r\nof new Manufacture within this Realm, to the first true Inventor\r\nor Inventors of such Manufactures which others at the time of\r\nthe Making of such Letters Patents Grants did not use, so they\r\nbe not contrary to the Law, nor mischievous to the State, by\r\nRaising of the Prices of Commodities at home, or Hurt by Trade,\r\nor generally inconvenient.\"\r\n\r\n21. For example, in a letter to Madison commenting on the draft\r\nof the Constitution: \"I like it, as far as it goes; but I should\r\nhave been for going further. For instance, the following\r\nalterations and additions would have pleased me: . . . Article\r\n9. Monopolies may be allowed to persons for their own\r\nproductions in literature, and their own inventions in the arts,\r\nfor a term not exceeding . . . years, but for no longer term,\r\nand no other purpose.\" Letter from Thomas Jefferson to James\r\nMadison (August 28, 1789), in Writings of Thomas Jefferson, vol.\r\n7, 450-451.\r\n\r\n22. \"Monopolies tho' in certain cases useful ought to be granted\r\nwith caution, and guarded with strictness against abuse. The\r\nConstitution of the U.S. has limited them to two cases--the\r\nauthors of Books, and of useful inventions, in both which they\r\nare considered as a compensation for a benefit actually gained\r\nto the community as a purchase of property which the owner might\r\notherwise withhold from public use. There can be no just\r\nobjection to a temporary monopoly in these cases: but it ought\r\nto be temporary because under that limitation a sufficient\r\nrecompence and encouragement may be given. The limitation is\r\nparticularly proper in the case of inventions, because they grow\r\nso much out of preceding ones that there is the less merit in\r\nthe authors; and because, for the same reason, the discovery\r\nmight be expected in a short time from other hands. . . .\r\nMonopolies have been granted in other Countries, and by some of\r\nthe States in this, on another principle, that of supporting\r\nsome useful undertaking, until experience and success should\r\nrender the monopoly unnecessary, and lead to a salutary\r\ncompetition . . . But grants of this sort can be justified in\r\nvery peculiar cases only, if at all; the danger being very great\r\nthat the good resulting from the operation of the monopoly, will\r\nbe overbalanced by the evil effect of the precedent; and it\r\nbeing not impossible that the monopoly itself in its original\r\noperation, may produce more evil than good. In all cases of\r\nmonopoly, not excepting those in favor of authors and inventors,\r\nit would be well to reserve to the State, a right to extinguish\r\nthe monopoly by paying a specified and reasonable sum. . . .\r\nPerpetual monopolies of every sort are forbidden not only by the\r\nGenius of free Governments, but by the imperfection of human\r\nforesight.\" James Madison, \"Monopolies, Perpetuities,\r\nCorporations, Ecclesiastical Endowments\" (1819), in \"Aspects of\r\nMonopoly One Hundred Years Ago,\" Harper's Magazine, ed.

Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations, pt. 3, Of the Expenses of\r\nPublic Works and Public Institutions, 2nd ed. (Oxford: Oxford\r\nUniversity Press, 1880), 2:339: \"When a company of merchants\r\nundertake, at their own risk and expense, to establish a new\r\ntrade with some remote and barbarous nation, it may not be\r\nunreasonable to incorporate them into a joint-stock company, and\r\nto grant them, in case of their success, a monopoly of the trade\r\nfor a certain number of years. It is the easiest and most\r\nnatural way in which the state can recompense them for hazarding\r\na dangerous and expensive experiment, of which the public is\r\nafterwards to reap the benefit. A temporary monopoly of this\r\nkind may be vindicated, upon the same principles upon which a\r\nlike monopoly of a new machine is granted to its inventor, and\r\nthat of a new book to its author. But upon the expiration of the\r\nterm, the monopoly ought certainly to determine; the forts and\r\ngarrisons, if it was found necessary to establish any, to be\r\ntaken into the hands of government, their value to be paid to\r\nthe company, and the trade to be laid open to all the subjects\r\nof the state. By a perpetual monopoly, all the other subjects of\r\nthe state are taxed very absurdly in two different ways: first,\r\nby the high price of goods, which, in the case of a free trade,\r\nthey could\r\nbuy much cheaper; and, secondly, by their total exclusion from a\r\nbranch of business which it might be both convenient and\r\nprofitable for many of them to carry on.\"\r\n\r\n24.

The two most influential and brilliant examples are Justin\r\nHughes, \"The Philosophy of Intellectual Property,\" Georgetown\r\nLaw Journal 77 (1988): 287-366, and Wendy J. Gordon, \"A Property\r\nRight in Self-Expression: Equality and Individualism in the\r\nNatural Law of Intellectual Property,\" Yale Law Journal 102\r\n(1993): 1533-1610. Both of these articles attempt not to use\r\nLocke as the basis for a world of absolute right, but instead to\r\nfocus on the Locke whose world of private property coexisted\r\nwith a commons--albeit one much diminished after the invention of\r\nmoney. If one goes far enough into the Lockean conception--fine-\r\ntuning \"enough and as good\" so as to allow for a vigorous\r\ncommons, and the claims of labor so as to take account of the\r\nimportance of the embedded contributions of culture and\r\nscience--then the differences between the Jeffersonian view and\r\nthe Lockean view start to recede in significance. Academics have\r\nfound the Lockean view attractive, noting, correctly, that Locke\r\nis commonly brandished as a rhetorical emblem for property\r\nschemes that he himself would have scorned. Yet when one looks\r\nat the actual world of intellectual property policy discourse,\r\nand the difficulty of enunciating even the simple Jeffersonian\r\nantimonopolist ideas I lay out here, it is hard to imagine the\r\nnuanced Lockean view flourishing. Consider this comment of\r\nJeremy Waldron's and ask yourself--is this result more likely\r\nfrom within the Jeffersonian or the Lockean view?\r\n\r\nOur tendency of course is to focus on authors when we think\r\nabout intellectual property. Many of us are authors ourselves:\r\nreading a case about copyright we can empathize readily with a\r\nplaintiff's feeling for the effort he has put in, his need to\r\ncontrol his work, and his natural desire to reap the fruits of\r\nhis own labor. In this Essay, however, I shall look at the way\r\nwe think about actual, potential and putative infringers of\r\ncopyright, those whose freedom is or might be constrained by\r\nothers' ownership of songs, plays, words, images and stories.\r\nClearly our concept of the author and this concept of the copier\r\nare two sides of the same coin. If we think of an author as\r\nhaving a natural right to profit from his work, then we will\r\nthink of the copier as some sort of thief; whereas if we think\r\nof the author as beneficiary of a statutory monopoly, it may be\r\neasier to see the copier as an embodiment of free enterprise\r\nvalues. These are the connections I want to discuss, and my\r\nargument will be that we cannot begin to unravel the conundrums\r\nof moral justification in this area unless we are willing to\r\napproach the matter even-handedly from both sides of the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nAfter a magisterial study of justifications for the existing\r\nworld of intellectual property, Waldron concludes, \"[t]he fact\r\nis, however, that whether or not we speak of a burden of proof,\r\nan institution like intellectual property is not self-\r\njustifying; we owe a justification to anyone who finds that he\r\ncan move less freely than he would in the absence of the\r\ninstitution. So although the people whose perspective I have\r\ntaken--the copiers--may be denigrated as unoriginal plagiarists or\r\nthieves of others' work, still they are the ones who feel the\r\nimmediate impact of our intellectual property laws. It affects\r\nwhat they may do, how they may speak, and how they may earn a\r\nliving. Of course nothing is settled by saying that it is their\r\ninterests that are particularly at stake; if the tables were\r\nturned, we should want to highlight the perspective of the\r\nauthors. But as things stand, the would-be copiers are the ones\r\nto whom a justification of intellectual property is owed.\" See\r\nJeremy Waldron, \"From Authors to Copiers: Individual Rights and\r\nSocial Values in Intellectual Property,\" Chicago-Kent Law Review\r\n68 (1993): 841, 842, 887. That justification seems more\r\nplausibly and practically to come from the perspective I sketch\r\nout here. See also William Fisher, \"Theories of Intellectual\r\nProperty,\" in New Essays in the Legal and Political Theory of\r\nProperty, ed. Stephen R.

Apart from being anonymous, this poem is extremely hard to\r\ndate. It probably originates in the enclosure controversies of\r\nthe eighteenth century. However, the earliest reference to it\r\nthat I have been able to discover is from 1821. Edward Birch was\r\nmoved to compose some (fairly poor) verses in response when he\r\nreported \"seeing the following jeu d'esprit in a Handbill posted\r\nup in Plaistow, as a 'CAUTION' to prevent persons from\r\nsupporting the intended inclosure of Hainault or Waltham\r\nForest.\" He then quotes a version of the poem. Edward Birch,\r\nTickler Magazine 3 (February 1821), 45. In 1860, \"Exon,\" a staff\r\nwriter for the journal Notes and Queries, declares that \"the\r\nanimosity excited against the Inclosure Acts and their authors .\r\n. . was almost without precedent: though fifty years and more\r\nhave passed, the subject is still a sore one in many parishes. .\r\n. . I remember some years ago, in hunting over an old library\r\ndiscovering a box full of printed squibs, satires and ballads of\r\nthe time against the acts and those who were supposed to favor\r\nthem,--the library having belonged to a gentleman who played an\r\nactive part on the opposition side.\" \"Exon,\" \"Ballads Against\r\nInclosures,\" Notes and Queries 9, 2nd series (February 1860):\r\n130-131. He reports finding the poem in that box, and quotes a\r\nverse from it. The context of the article makes it appear that\r\nthe poem itself must date from the late eighteenth century. In\r\nother sources, the poem is sometimes dated at 1764, and said to\r\nbe in response to Sir Charles Pratt's fencing of common land.\r\nSee, e.g., Dana A. Freiburger, \"John Thompson, English\r\nPhilomath--A Question of Land Surveying and Astronomy,\" n. 15,\r\navailable at\r\nhttp://www.nd.edu/~histast4/exhibits/papers/Freiburger/. This\r\nattribution is widespread and may well be true, but I have been\r\nable to discover no contemporary source material that sustains\r\nit. By the end of the nineteenth century, the poem was being\r\nquoted, sometimes with amusement and sometimes with agreement,\r\non both sides of the Atlantic. See Ezra S. Carr, \"Aids and\r\nObstacles to Agriculture on the Pacific-Coast,\" in The Patrons\r\nof Husbandry on the Pacific Coast (San Francisco: A. L. Bancroft\r\nand Co., 1875), 290-291; Edward P. Cheyney, An Introduction to\r\nthe Industrial and Social History of England (New York:\r\nMacmillan, 1901), 219.\r\n\r\n2. Although we refer to it as the enclosure movement, it was\r\nactually a series of enclosures that started in the fifteenth\r\ncentury and went on, with differing means, ends, and varieties\r\nof state involvement, until the nineteenth. See, e.g., J. A.\r\nYelling, Common Field and Enclosure in England, 1450-1850\r\n(Hamden, Conn.: Archon Books, 1977).\r\n\r\n3. Thomas More, Utopia (New York: W. J. Black, 1947), 32.\r\n\r\n4. Karl Polanyi, Great Transformation: The Political and\r\nEconomic Origins of Our Time (Boston: Beacon Press, 1957), 35.\r\nPolanyi continues in the same vein. \"The fabric of society was\r\nbeing disrupted. Desolate villages and the ruins of human\r\ndwellings testified to the fierceness with which the revolution\r\nraged, endangering the defenses of the country, wasting its\r\ntowns, decimating its population, turning its overburdened soil\r\ninto dust, harassing its people and turning them from decent\r\nhusbandmen into a mob of beggars and thieves.\" Ibid. See also E.\r\nP. Thompson, The Making of the English Working Class (London: V.\r\nGollancz, 1963), 218.\r\n\r\n5. See generally Lord Ernle, English Farming Past and Present,\r\n6th ed. (Chicago: Quadrangle Books, 1961).\r\n\r\n6. For an excellent summary of the views of Hobbes, Locke, and\r\nBlackstone on these points, see Hannibal Travis, \"Pirates of the\r\nInformation Infrastructure: Blackstonian Copyright and the First\r\nAmendment,\" Berkeley Technology Law Journal 15 (2000): 789-803.\r\n\r\n7. More recent accounts which argue that enclosure led to\r\nproductivity gains tend to be more qualified in their praise.\r\nCompare the more positive account given in Ernle, English\r\nFarming, with Michael Turner, \"English Open Fields and\r\nEnclosures: Retardation or Productivity Improvements,\" Journal\r\nof Economic History 46 (1986): 688: \"Enclosure cannot be seen as\r\nthe automatic open door to this cycle of agricultural\r\nimprovement, but the foregoing estimates do suggest that perhaps\r\nit was a door which opened frequently, and with profit.\"\r\n\r\n8. Most notably work by Robert C. Allen: \"The Efficiency and\r\nDistributional Consequences of Eighteenth Century Enclosures,\"\r\nThe Economic Journal 92 (1982): 937-953; Enclosure and The\r\nYeoman (New York: Oxford University Press, 1992). Allen argues\r\nthat the enclosure movement produced major distributional\r\nconsequences, but little observable efficiency gain. The pie was\r\ncarved up differently, to the advantage of the landlords, but\r\nmade no larger. In contrast, Turner sees enclosure as one\r\npossible, though not a necessary, route to productivity gains\r\n(\"English Open Fields,\" 688). Donald McCloskey's work also\r\nargues for efficiency gains from enclosure, largely from the\r\nevidence provided by rent increases. Donald N. McCloskey, \"The\r\nEnclosure of Open Fields: Preface to a Study of Its Impact on\r\nthe Efficiency of English Agriculture in the Eighteenth\r\nCentury,\" Journal of Economic History 32 (1972): 15-35; \"The\r\nPrudent Peasant: New Findings on Open Fields,\" Journal of\r\nEconomic History 51 (1991): 343-355. In Allen's view, however,\r\nthe increase in rents was largely a measure of the way that\r\nchanges in legal rights altered the bargaining power of the\r\nparties and the cultural context of rent negotiations; enclosure\r\nallowed landlords to capture more of the existing surplus\r\nproduced by the land, rather than dramatically expanding it.\r\n\"[T]he enclosure movement itself might be regarded as the first\r\nstate sponsored land reform. Like so many since, it was\r\njustified with efficiency arguments, while its main effect\r\n(according to the data analysed here) was to redistribute income\r\nto already rich landowners.\" Allen, \"Eighteenth Century\r\nEnclosures,\" 950-951.\r\n\r\n9. The possibility of producing \"order without law\" and thus\r\nsometimes governing the commons without tragedy has also\r\nfascinated scholars of contemporary land use. Robert C.\r\nEllickson, Order without Law: How Neighbors Settle Disputes\r\n(Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1991); Elinor\r\nOstrom, Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for\r\nCollective Action (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990).\r\n\r\n10. The analogy to the enclosure movement has been too succulent\r\nto resist. To my knowledge, Ben Kaplan, Pamela Samuelson, Yochai\r\nBenkler, David Lange, Christopher May, David Bollier, and Keith\r\nAoki have all employed the trope, as I myself have on previous\r\noccasions. For a particularly thoughtful and careful development\r\nof the parallel between the two enclosure movements, see Travis,\r\n\"Pirates of the Information Infrastructure.\"\r\n\r\n11.

I might be suspected of anti-economist irony here. In truth,\r\nneither side's arguments are fully satisfying. It is easy to\r\nagree with Richard Posner that the language of economics offers\r\na \"thin and unsatisfactory epistemology\" through which to\r\nunderstand the world. Richard Posner, The Problems of\r\nJurisprudence (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press,\r\n1990): xiv (quoting Paul Bator, \"The Judicial Universe of Judge\r\nRichard Posner,\" University of Chicago Law Review 52 (1985):\r\n1161). On the other hand, explaining what it means to \"own one's\r\nown body,\" or specifying the noncommodifiable limits on the\r\nmarket, turns out to be a remarkably tricky business, as\r\nMargaret Jane Radin has shown with great elegance in Contested\r\nCommodities (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1996).\r\n\r\n18. Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the\r\nCouncil of 11 March 1996 on the Legal Protection of Databases,\r\n1996 Official Journal of the European Union (L 77) 20, available\r\nat http://europa.eu.int/ISPO/infosoc/legreg/docs/969ec.html.\r\n\r\n19. The phrase \"Washington consensus\" originated in John\r\nWilliamson, \"What Washington Means by Policy Reform,\" in Latin\r\nAmerican Adjustment: How Much Has Happened? ed. John Williamson\r\n(Washington, D.C.: Institute for International Economics, 1990).\r\nOver time it has come to be used as shorthand for a neoliberal\r\nview of economic policy that puts its faith in deregulation,\r\nprivatization, and the creation and defense of secure property\r\nrights as the cure for all ills. (See Joseph Stiglitz, \"The\r\nWorld Bank at the Millennium,\" Economic Journal 109 [1999]:\r\n577-597.) It has thus become linked to the triumphalist\r\nneoliberal account of the end of history and the victory of\r\nunregulated markets: see Francis Fukuyama, The End of History\r\nand the Last Man (New York: Free Press, 1992). Neither of these\r\ntwo results are, to be fair, what its creator intended. See John\r\nWilliamson, \"What Should the Bank Think about the Washington\r\nConsensus?\" Institute for International Economics (July 1999),\r\navailable at\r\nhttp://www.iie.com/publications/papers/paper.cfm?ResearchID=351.\r\n\r\n20. Garrett Hardin, \"The Tragedy of the Commons,\" Science 162\r\n(1968): 1243-1248.\r\n\r\n21. The differences are particularly strong in the arguments\r\nover \"desert\"--are these property rights deserved or are they\r\nsimply violations of the public trust, privatizations of the\r\ncommons? For example, some would say that we never had the same\r\ntraditional claims over the genetic commons that the victims of\r\nthe first enclosure movement had over theirs; this is more like\r\nnewly discovered frontier land, or perhaps even privately\r\ndrained marshland, than it is like well-known common land that\r\nall have traditionally used. In this case, the enclosers can\r\nclaim (though their claims are disputed) that they discovered or\r\nperhaps simply made usable the territory they seek to own. The\r\nopponents of gene patenting, on the other hand, turn more\r\nfrequently than the farmers of the eighteenth century to\r\nreligious and ethical arguments about the sanctity of life and\r\nthe incompatibility of property with living systems. These\r\narguments, or the appeals to free speech that dominate debates\r\nover digital intellectual property, have no precise analogue in\r\ndebates over hunting or pasturage, though again there are common\r\nthemes. For example, we are already seeing nostalgic laments of\r\nthe loss of the immemorial rights of Internet users. At the same\r\ntime, the old language of property law is turned to this more\r\nevanescent subject matter; a favorite title of mine is I.\r\nTrotter Hardy, \"The Ancient Doctrine of Trespass to Web Sites,\"\r\n1996, art. 7, Journal of Online Law art. 7, available at\r\nhttp://www.wm.edu/law/publications/jol/95_96/hardy.html.\r\n\r\n22. The exceptions to this statement turn out to be fascinating.\r\nIn the interest of brevity, however, I will ignore them\r\nentirely.\r\n\r\n23. Remember, I am talking here about increases in the level of\r\nrights: protecting new subject matter for longer periods of\r\ntime, criminalizing certain technologies, making it illegal to\r\ncut through digital fences even if they have the effect of\r\nforeclosing previously lawful uses, and so on. Each of these has\r\nthe effect of diminishing the public domain in the name of\r\nnational economic policy.\r\n\r\n24.

When the qualification\r\nlevels for patents are set too low, the benefits are minuscule\r\nand the costs very high--the web of property rights is\r\nparticularly tangled, complicating follow-on innovation, the\r\nmonopoly goes to \"buy\" a very low level of inventiveness, and\r\nthe disclosure is of little value.\r\n\r\n28.

Yet that is exactly what the DMCA does:\r\nalters \"the traditional contours of copyright protection\" by\r\nhanding out the exclusive right at the same time as it confers a\r\nlegal power to remove the privilege of fair use.\r\n\r\n9. See Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Reimerdes, 111 F. Supp.\r\n2d 294, 304-5 (S.D.N.Y. 2000).\r\n\r\n10. Ibid., 329-30 (quoting Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v.\r\nFCC, 512 U.S. 622, 662 (1997) (quoting U.S. v. O'Brien, 391 U.S.\r\n367, 377 (internal quotations omitted)).\r\n\r\n11. Ibid., 331-332.\r\n\r\n12. One empirical study seems to challenge this assumption,\r\nthough at modest levels. Rafael Rob and Joel Waldfogel, \"Piracy\r\non the Silver Screen,\" Journal of Industrial Economics 55\r\n(2007): 379-395. Rob and Waldfogel surveyed college\r\nstudents--traditionally a population that engages in high levels\r\nof downloading since they have \"free\" and extremely high speed\r\nInternet connections, lots of leisure time, and low disposable\r\nincome. Even among this group, the authors found that total\r\nlevels of downloading were low--2.1 percent of paid consumption.\r\nThe authors also assumed that all unpaid downloading or DVD\r\nburning was equal to piracy--an assumption that is clearly false.\r\nThe Sony case makes that clear. In fact, Rob and Waldfogel found\r\na positive relationship between second time unpaid viewings and\r\nfuture paid viewings; watching the movie a second time on a\r\ndownloaded or privately made copy burned from the airwaves\r\nactually was associated with more paid purchases. The authors\r\nwere skeptical of any causal link, however. Ibid., 389.\r\n\r\n13. Admittedly, section 1201 only affects works protected under\r\nthe copyright act, so arguably the legal protection of the\r\ndigital fence would expire with the copyright term. But even if\r\nthe courts interpreted the statute this way, two problems would\r\nremain. First, since the DMCA prohibited the trafficking in\r\ntools which allowed the breaking of the encryption, the law\r\nwould have effectively forbidden the production of wire cutters\r\nfor gaining access to identically encrypted public domain\r\nworks--remember Judge Kaplan's discussion of the irrelevance of\r\nMr. Johansen's motives. Second, it would be trivially easy to\r\nadd a trivial amount of new copyrighted material to the work\r\nthat had fallen into the public domain. Access to the public\r\ndomain work would then be prohibited for another period of life\r\nplus seventy years. And so on. The Copyright Office holds\r\nhearings on the question of whether there are any \"classes of\r\nwork\" that need exemption from the DMCA's provisions. So far,\r\nthose exemptions have been highly restrictive in application.\r\n\r\n14. Eldred v. Ashcroft, 537 U.S. 186 (2003) at 221 (citing\r\nHarper & Row, 471 U.S. at 560).\r\n\r\n15.

Current flows in such\r\na wire, but we don't ask what the incentive is for the electrons\r\nto leave home. We say that the current results from an emergent\r\nproperty of the system, which we call induction. The question we\r\nask is 'what's the resistance of the wire?' So Moglen's\r\nMetaphorical Corollary to Faraday's Law says that if you wrap\r\nthe Internet around every person on the planet and spin the\r\nplanet, software flows in the network. It's an emergent property\r\nof connected human minds that they create things for one\r\nanother's pleasure and to conquer their uneasy sense of being\r\ntoo alone. The only question to ask is, what's the resistance of\r\nthe network? Moglen's Metaphorical Corollary to Ohm's Law states\r\nthat the resistance of the network is directly proportional to\r\nthe field strength of the 'intellectual property' system. So the\r\nright answer to the econodwarf is, resist the resistance.\"\r\n\r\n12. Benkler's reasoning is characteristically elegant, even\r\nformal in its precision, while mine is clunkier.

Jonathan Zittrain, The Future of the Internet--And How to Stop\r\nIt (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 2008).\r\n\r\n2. Of course, these are not the only assumptions, arguments, and\r\nmetaphors around. Powerful counterweights exist: the ideas of\r\nJefferson and Macaulay, which I described here, but also others,\r\nmore loosely related--the Scottish Enlightenment's stress on the\r\npolitical and moral benefits of competition, free commerce, and\r\nfree labor; deep economic and political skepticism about\r\nmonopolies; the strong traditions of open science; and even\r\nliberalism's abiding focus on free speech and access to\r\ninformation. If you hear the slogan \"information wants to be\r\nfree,\" you may agree or disagree with the personification. You\r\nmay find the idea simplistic. But you do not find it\r\nincomprehensible, as you might if someone said \"housing wants to\r\nbe free\" or \"food wants to be free.\" We view access to\r\ninformation and culture as vital to successful versions of both\r\ncapitalism and liberal democracy. We apply to blockages in\r\ninformation flow or disparities in access to information a\r\nskepticism that does not always apply to other social goods. Our\r\nattitudes toward informational resources are simply different\r\nfrom our attitudes toward other forms of power, wealth, or\r\nadvantage. It is one of the reasons that the Jefferson Warning\r\nis so immediately attractive. It is this attitudinal difference\r\nthat makes the political terrain on these issues so fascinating.\r\n\r\n3.

That balance,\r\nshe suggests, is not bug but feature. The spaces of freedom that\r\nexist in the analog world because widespread use is possible\r\nwithout copying are neither oversights, nor temporarily\r\nabandoned mines of monopoly rent just waiting for a better\r\ntechnological retrieval method.

This process runs counter to the assumptions of theorists of\r\ncollective action problems in a way remarkable enough to have\r\nattracted its own chroniclers. See Amy Kapczynski, \"The Access\r\nto Knowledge Mobilization and the New Politics of Intellectual\r\nProperty,\" Yale Law Journal 117 (2008): 804-885. Economists\r\ngenerally assume preferences are simply given, individuals just\r\nhave them and they are \"exogenous\" to the legal system in the\r\nsense that they are unaffected by the allocation of legal\r\nrights. The emergence of the movements and institutions I am\r\ndescribing here paints a different picture. The \"preferences\"\r\nare socially constructed, created through a collective process\r\nof debate and decision which shifts the level of abstraction\r\nupwards; and, as Kapczynski perceptively notes, they are highly\r\ninfluenced by the legal categories and rights against which the\r\ngroups involved initially defined themselves.\r\n\r\n18.
