Lowndes,\r\nwhich was delivered me yesterday. The truth of Captains Lightbowen and\r\nLowndes’ information is now verified by the presence of your father and\r\nsister, for whose safe arrival I pray, and that they may convey that\r\nsatisfaction to your soul that must naturally flow from the sight of\r\nabsent friends in health; and shall, for news this way, refer you to\r\nthem. As to what you say respecting your soon having the happiness of\r\nseeing us all, I wish for an accomplishment of your hopes, provided\r\nthey are concomitant with your welfare, otherwise not; though I doubt\r\nwhether I shall be present or not, for, to confess my weakness, Ned, my\r\nambition is prevalent, so that I contemn the grovelling condition of a\r\nclerk or the like, to which my fortune condemns me, and would willingly\r\nrisk my life, though not my character, to exalt my station. I am\r\nconfident, Ned, that my youth excludes me from any hopes of immediate\r\npreferment, nor do I desire it; but I mean to prepare the way for\r\nfuturity. I’m no philosopher, you see, and may justly be said to build\r\ncastles in the air; my folly makes me ashamed, and beg you’ll conceal\r\nit; yet, Neddy, we have seen such schemes successful when the projector\r\nis constant. I shall conclude by saying, I wish there was a war.\r\n\r\nP. S. I this moment received yours by William Smith, and am pleased to\r\nsee you give such close application to study.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO TILEMAN CRUGER.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      St. Croix, Nov. 16, 1771.\r\n\r\nIn behalf of Mr. Nicholas Cruger, (who, by reason of a very ill\r\nstate of health, went from this to New-York, the 15th ult.,) I have\r\nthe pleasure to address you by the long-expected sloop Thunderbolt,\r\nCapt. William Newton, owned by Messrs. Jacob Walton, John Harris, and\r\nNicholas Cruger, the latter of whom has written you fully concerning\r\nher destination, which I need not repeat. She has on board besides a\r\nparcel of lumber for yourself, sundry articles on account of her owners\r\nas per inclosed bill of lading; and when you have disposed of them, you\r\nwill please to credit each partner for one third of the proceeds.\r\n\r\nMr. N. Cruger’s proportion of this, and the balance of your account\r\nhitherto, will more than pay for his one third cost of her first cargo\r\nup; and for the other two, I shall endeavor to place value in your\r\nhands betimes. I only wish for a line from you to know what will best\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nReports here represent matters in a very disagreeable light, with\r\nregard to the Guarda Costas, which are said to swarm upon the coast;\r\nbut as you will be the best judge of what danger there might be, all is\r\nsubmitted to your prudent direction.\r\n\r\nCapt. Newton must arm with you, as he could not so conveniently do it\r\nhere. Give me leave to hint to you that you cannot be too particular\r\nin your instructions to him. I think he seems to want experience in\r\nsuch voyages. Messrs. Walton and John H. Cruger are to furnish you\r\nthemselves with their respective proportion of the cost of the several\r\ncargoes.\r\n\r\nThe staves on board, if by any means convenient, I beg may be returned\r\nby the sloop, they will command a good price here, and I suppose little\r\nor nothing with you; could they be got at I would not send them down,\r\nbut they are stowed promiscuously among other things.\r\n\r\nIf convenient, please to deliver the hogsheads, now containing the\r\nIndian meal, to the captain as water casks, and others should he want\r\nthem. I supplied him with twenty here. I must beg your reference to Mr.\r\nCruger’s last letter of the 2d ult. for other particulars.\r\n\r\nOur crop will be very early, so that the utmost dispatch is necessary\r\nto import three cargoes of mules in due time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CAPTAIN WILLIAM NEWTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      St. Croix, Nov. 16, 1771.\r\n\r\nHerewith I give you all your dispatches, and desire you will proceed\r\nimmediately to Curracoa. You are to deliver your cargo there to Tileman\r\nCruger, Esq., agreeably to your bill of lading, whose directions you\r\nmust follow in every respect concerning the disposal of your vessel\r\nafter your arrival.\r\n\r\nYou know it is intended that you shall go from thence to the main\r\nfor a load of mules, and I must beg if you do, you’ll be very choice\r\nin the quality of your mules, and bring as many as your vessel can\r\nconveniently contain--by all means take in a large supply of provender.\r\nRemember, you are to make three trips this season, and unless you are\r\nvery diligent you will be too late, as our crops will be early in. Take\r\ncare to avoid the Guarda Costas. I place an entire reliance upon the\r\nprudence of your conduct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW-YORK, AUGUST 31, 1776.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAY-BOOK\r\n\r\nOF THE\r\n\r\n_State Company of Artillery_,\r\n\r\nCOMMANDED BY\r\n\r\nAlex’r Hamilton.\r\n\r\nSpecimen of Notes scattered throughout this Pay-Book.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Rousseau’s Emilius.\r\n  Smith’s History of New-York.\r\n  Leonidas.\r\n  View of the Universe.\r\n  Lex Mercatoria.\r\n  Millot’s History of France.\r\n  Memoirs of the House of Brandenburgh.\r\n  Review of the characters of the principal Nations of Europe.\r\n  Review of Europe.\r\n  History of Prussia.\r\n  History of France.\r\n  Lassel’s Voyage through Italy.\r\n  Robinson’s Charles V.\r\n  Present State of Europe.\r\n  Grecian History.\r\n  Baretti’s Travels.\r\n  Bacon’s Essays.\r\n  Philosophical Transactions.\r\n  Hobbe’s Dialogues.\r\n  Plutarch’s Morals.\r\n  Cicero’s do.\r\n  Orations--Demosthenes.\r\n  Cudworth’s Intellectual System.\r\n  Entick’s History of the late War.\r\n  European Settlements in America.\r\n  Ralt’s Dictionary of Trade and Commerce.\r\n  Winn’s History of America.\r\n  Montaigne’s Essays.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch in the Greenland fishery have from 150 to 200 sail and ten\r\nthousand seamen.\r\n\r\nIt is ordered that in their public prayers they pray that it would\r\nplease God to bless the Government--the Lords--the States and their\r\ngreat and small fisheries.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHamburgh and Germany has a balance against England--they furnish her\r\nwith large quantities of linen.

The most material is respecting the pay. Our company, by their\r\narticles, are to be subject to the same regulations, and to receive the\r\nsame pay, as the Continental Artillery. Hitherto I have conformed to\r\nthe standard laid down in the Journal of the Congress, published the\r\n10th May, 1775; but I am well informed that, by some later regulation,\r\nthe pay of the Artillery has been augmented, and now stands according\r\nto the following rates: Captain, £10. 13. 4. Captain-Lieutenant, £8.\r\nLieutenants, each, £7. 6. 8. Sergeants, £3. 6. 8. Corporals, £3. 1. 4.\r\nBombardiers, £3. 1. 4. Gunners, £3. Matrosses, £2. 17. 4. Drummers and\r\nFifers, £3. By comparing these with my pay-rolls, you will discover a\r\nconsiderable difference; and I doubt not you will be easily sensible\r\nthat such a difference should not exist.\r\n\r\nI am not personally interested in having an augmentation agreeably\r\nto the above rates, because my own pay will remain the same as that\r\nit now is: but I make this application on behalf of the company; as\r\nI am fully convinced such a disadvantageous distinction will have a\r\nvery pernicious effect on the minds and behavior of the men. They\r\ndo the same duty with the other companies, and think themselves\r\nentitled to the same pay. They have been already comparing accounts;\r\nand many marks of discontent have lately appeared on this score.\r\nAs to the circumstance of our being confined to the defence of the\r\ncolony, it will have little or no weight; for there are but few in the\r\ncompany, who would not as willingly leave the colony on any necessary\r\nexpedition, as stay in it: and they will not, therefore, think it\r\nreasonable to have their pay curtailed on such a consideration. Captain\r\nBeauman, I understand, enlists all his men on the above terms; and\r\nthis makes it difficult for me to get a single recruit: for men will\r\nnaturally go to those who pay them best. On this account, I should\r\nwish to be immediately authorized to offer the same pay to all who may\r\nincline to enlist. The next thing I should wish to know, is, whether I\r\nmust be allowed any _actual expenses_ that might attend the enlistment\r\nof men, should I send into the country for that purpose. The expense\r\nwould not be great; and it would enable me to complete my company at\r\nonce, and bring it the sooner into proper order and discipline.\r\n\r\nAlso, I should be glad to be informed, if my company is to be allowed\r\nthe frock which is given to the other troops as a bounty? This frock\r\nwould be extremely serviceable in summer, while the men are on fatigue;\r\nand would put it in their power to save their uniform much longer. I\r\nam, gentlemen, with the greatest respect,\r\n\r\n                                   Your most obedient servant,\r\n                                   Alexander Hamilton, Captain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO THE PROVINCIAL CONGRESS.\r\n\r\n                                                          July 26, 1776.\r\n\r\nGentlemen:\r\n\r\nI am obliged to trouble you, to remove a difficulty which arises\r\nrespecting the quantity of subsistence which is to be allowed my men.\r\nInclosed you have the rates of rations, which is the standard allowance\r\nof the whole continental, and even the provincial, army; but it seems\r\nMr. Curtenius cannot afford to supply us with more than his contract\r\nstipulates; which, by comparison, you will perceive is considerably\r\nless than the forementioned rate.\r\n\r\nMy men, you are sensible, are, by their articles, entitled to the same\r\nsubsistence with the continental troops: and it would be to them an\r\ninsupportable discrimination, as well as a breach of the terms of their\r\nenlistment, to give them almost a third less provisions than the whole\r\narmy besides receives. I doubt not you will readily put this matter\r\nupon a proper footing.\r\n\r\nHitherto we have drawn our full allowance from Mr. Curtenius; but he\r\ndid it upon the supposition that he would have a farther consideration\r\nfor the extraordinary supply.\r\n\r\nAt present, however, he scruples to proceed in the same way, till it\r\ncan be put upon a more certain foundation. I am, gentlemen,\r\n\r\n                                  With the utmost esteem and respect,\r\n                                  Your most ob’t and most humble serv’t,\r\n                                  A. Hamilton,\r\n                                  Captain of New-York Artillery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO THE HONORABLE CONVENTION OF NEW-YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        New-York, August, 1776.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary I should inform you that there is at present a vacancy\r\nin my company, arising from the promotion of Lieut. Johnson to a\r\nCaptaincy in one of the new Gallies (which command, however, he has\r\nsince resigned for a very particular reason). As Artillery officers\r\nare scarce in proportion to the call for them, and as myself and my\r\nremaining officers sustain an extraordinary weight of duty on account\r\nof the present vacancy, I shall esteem it a favor, if you will be\r\npleased, as soon as possible, to make up my deficiency by a new\r\nappointment. It would be productive of much inconvenience should not\r\nthe inferior officers succeed in course, and from this consideration\r\nI doubt not you will think it proper to advance Mr. Gilleland and Mr.\r\nBean, and fill up the third lieutenancy with some other person. I\r\nwould beg the liberty _warmly_ to recommend to your attention Thomas\r\nThompson--now first Sergeant in my company--a man highly deserving\r\nof notice and preferment. He has discharged his duty in his present\r\nstation with uncommon fidelity, assiduity, and expertness. He is a very\r\ngood disciplinarian--possesses the advantage of having seen a good deal\r\nof service in Germany, has a tolerable share of common sense, and will\r\nnot disgrace the rank of an officer and gentleman. In a word, I verily\r\nbelieve, he will make an excellent Lieutenant, and his advancement will\r\nbe a great encouragement and benefit to my company in particular, and\r\nwill be an animating example to all men of merit to whose knowledge\r\nit comes. Myself and my officers will be much obliged to the Hon. the\r\nConvention to favor us with our commissions with all convenient speed,\r\nas they may be highly requisite under some circumstances that may\r\npossibly hereafter arise.\r\n\r\n                                          A. Hamilton,\r\n                                          Captain of New-York Artillery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLT. COL. HAMILTON TO THE PROVINCIAL CONGRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     Morristown, March 6, 1777.\r\n\r\nGentlemen:\r\n\r\nIt is necessary I should inform you of the changes which have happened\r\nin your Company of Artillery, which should have been done long ago, had\r\nI not been prevented by sickness, from which I am but lately recovered.\r\n\r\nGeneral Washington has been pleased to appoint me one of his\r\nAids-de-Camp. Captain-Lieutenant James Moore, a promising officer,\r\nand who did credit to the State he belonged to, died about nine weeks\r\nago. Lieutenant James Gilleland, some time before that, resigned his\r\ncommission, prompted by domestic inconveniences, and _other_ motives\r\nbest known to himself. There remain now only two officers, Lieutenants\r\nBean and Thompson, and about thirty men. The reason that the number of\r\nmen is so reduced, besides death and desertions, was owing to a breach\r\nof orders in Lieutenant Johnson, who first began the enlistment of the\r\ncompany; and who, instead of engaging them during the war, according\r\nto the intention of the State, engaged them for the limited term of a\r\ntwelvemonth. The time of those enlisted by him has expired; and for\r\nwant of powers to re-engage them, they have mostly entered into other\r\ncorps.\r\n\r\nI have to request you will favor me with instructions as to your future\r\nintentions. If you design to retain the company on the particular\r\nestablishment of the State, it will be requisite to complete the number\r\nof officers, and make provision to have the company filled by a new\r\nenlistment. In this case, I should beg leave to recommend to your\r\nnotice, as far as a Captain-Lieutenancy, Mr. Thompson. Mr. Bean is so\r\nincurably addicted to a _certain failing_, that I cannot, in justice,\r\ngive my opinion in favor of his preferment. But if you should determine\r\nto resign the company, as I expect you will, considering it as an\r\nextraordinary burthen, without affording any special advantages, the\r\nContinent will readily take it off your hands, so soon as you shall\r\nintimate your design to relinquish it. I doubt not you will see the\r\npropriety of speedily deciding on the matter, which the good of the\r\nservice requires.\r\n\r\n                            I am, with the sincerest respect, gentlemen,\r\n                            Your most ob’t and most humble servant,\r\n                            Alex. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMITTEE OF CONVENTION TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      Kingston, March 17, 1777.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nWe are to inform you, that Robert R. Livingston is, with us, a\r\ncommittee appointed by Convention to correspond with you at Head\r\nQuarters. You will give us pleasure in the information that His\r\nExcellency is recovered from the illness which had seized him the day\r\nbefore Messrs. Cuyler and Taylor left Head Quarters. Any occurrences in\r\nthe army which may have happened, you will please to communicate.\r\n\r\nIn answer to your letter to the Convention, of the sixth of March\r\ninstant, we are to inform you, that it is determined to permit that\r\ncompany to join the Continental Army, for which you will take the\r\nnecessary steps. At the same time, you will take some notice of the\r\ndisposition of our guns, which, as you well know, are all in the\r\nContinental service; and unless some little attention is paid to them,\r\nwe may, perhaps, never see them again.\r\n\r\n                                   We are, Sir,\r\n                                   Your most obed’t and humble servants,\r\n                                   Gouv. Morris,\r\n                                   Wm. Allison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOUVERNEUR MORRIS TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      Kingston, 26 March, 1777.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nBy unavoidable incidents, this letter is delayed beyond the usual\r\ntime; for which I assure you I am extremely sorry. Your favor gave\r\ngreat pleasure, as well to the committee as to several members of the\r\nHouse, who are much pleased with your judicious caution, to distinguish\r\nbetween what you sport as your private opinions, and the weighty\r\nsentiments of the General.\r\n\r\nNo circumstance could have more contributed to our happiness, than to\r\nhear of the General’s recovery; which, believe me, gave universal joy.\r\nBe pleased to make my most respectful compliments to his lady.\r\n\r\nThat the enemy are willing to desert, can hardly be doubted; and a\r\nvariety of sufficient reasons may easily be assigned.\r\n\r\nWant of success is not among the least considerable: add also the want\r\nof pay, the want of plunder. I think the situation of the enemy clearly\r\ndemonstrates the want of political wisdom, and knowledge of war, at\r\nthe fountain head. To pass over the succession of other blunders\r\nthey committed, from their attempt on Long Island to their present\r\ndisposition, their treatment of the soldiery is a monument of folly.\r\nFirst, to prevent their foreign mercenaries from deserting, they kept\r\nback arrearages of pay. And secondly, to prevent mutiny, and silence\r\nmurmurings, they allowed the plundering of a country they intend to\r\nconquer. Here common sense alone would have informed them, had they\r\nlistened to her dictates, that by irritating they would never subdue;\r\nand that an indulgence in excesses would relax all discipline. Taught\r\nby experience, they begin now to wind up the cords; but as it was said\r\nof James the First, they are always either too high or too low. Instead\r\nof liberal discipline, they ask servile obedience. Would it not be\r\nwise to meet this with taunting insult? To encourage our men in abuse\r\nof them, as poor slaves, hired without pay, yet not daring to vent a\r\ncomplaint; and contrast the different situations: at the same time\r\ninviting them to come and taste the air of freedom? The English are the\r\nproudest people on earth.\r\n\r\nYou will hear more of a little expedition against Peekskill at Head\r\nQuarters than I can tell you. I suppose it is intended as a diversion;\r\nif so, it is a ridiculous one.\r\n\r\n                                                  I am, &c.,\r\n                                                  Gouv. Morris.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCol. Alex. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIVINGSTON TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      Kingston, March 29, 1777.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nWe received your favor of the--instant, and am obliged to you not\r\nonly for your acceptance of a very troublesome challenge, but for the\r\nalacrity with which you meet us in the field. We wish it would afford\r\nyou as many laurels, as you are like to reap elsewhere.\r\n\r\nYou have heard of the enemy’s little excursion to Peekskill; we wish it\r\nmay not encourage them to make a more serious attempt: may it not be\r\nproper to remove the stores to a place of greater safety?\r\n\r\nWe are somewhat alarmed at accounts of the Indians having left their\r\nvillages; from whence many conclude, that they have hostile intentions:\r\nthough as they are much in our power, we cannot be entirely of this\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nYour reasons for supposing that the enemy will not proceed to\r\nPhiladelphia till the beginning of May seem to be conclusive; are you\r\nequally well satisfied that they may not open their campaign by sailing\r\nto the northward? You have probably seen some affidavits of people who\r\nhad been to New-York, which were sent by Convention to his Excellency\r\nthe General. As this does not go by our own express, we do not care to\r\nrisk any thing more on this subject, which we shall treat more at large\r\nin our next.\r\n\r\nTime must shortly prove the truth of Mr. Franklin’s conjecture, which\r\nderives great credit from the several accounts we daily receive of\r\nthe state of Europe. You will oblige us by communicating any further\r\nintelligence you may have received on this subject; its importance\r\nrenders us solicitous about the event.\r\n\r\n                                         I am, Sir, by order,\r\n                                         Your most obed’t humble serv’t,\r\n                                         Robert R. Livingston.\r\n\r\nCol. Alexander Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMITTEE OF CONVENTION TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       Kingston, April 2, 1777.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nWe received yours of the 29th ultimo, and are extremely sorry to hear\r\nof your indisposition.\r\n\r\nIn our last we expressed an apprehension that the enemy might possibly\r\nmake Hudson’s river their first object; not only because they could\r\nopen their campaign there earlier than they could go to Pennsylvania\r\n(as in one case their army would move by land, and in the other by\r\nwater); but because, having the command of the river, by taking the\r\nadvantage of a southerly wind, they would have it in their power to\r\nrun up in a few hours; and, by destroying the boats that are along its\r\nbanks, render it impossible for General Washington’s army to cross\r\ntill they have marched to Albany; a thing almost impracticable at this\r\nseason of the year, considering the distance, and badness of the roads.\r\nThis would enable them, not only to ravage all this State, but to enter\r\nConnecticut on its western side, where the disaffection of the people\r\nwill insure them many friends. We have strained every nerve to prepare\r\nfor their reception, having vested a power in General George Clinton\r\nto make whatever draughts he may think necessary from the militia:\r\nin consequence of which, every third man is ordered to be drawn\r\nfrom the southern, and every fifth man from the northern counties.\r\nWe are not without apprehensions that these heavy draughts will be\r\ndreadfully felt, in the want of the necessary supplies for the army\r\nand inhabitants, which can hardly be raised under such circumstances\r\nin this State: but more remote evils must yield to the pressures of\r\nnecessity. We inclose you, by direction of Convention, some resolutions\r\nlately passed, in order to render the laws against spies, and secret\r\nenemies, more effectual. You will be pleased to deliver them, with our\r\nrespectful compliments, to His Excellency the General.\r\n\r\nWe are happy to hear of the arrival of the vessel with arms from\r\nFrance, as no supplies can be more necessary. We flatter ourselves\r\nthat it will shortly be in our power to communicate more important\r\nintelligence from that quarter.\r\n\r\n                                 We are, with great respect, Sir,\r\n                                 Your most obedient and humble servants,\r\n                                 Wm. Allison.\r\n                                 Rob’t R. Livingston.\r\n                                 Gouv’r Morris.\r\n\r\nCol. Alex. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO A COMMITTEE OF THE PROVINCIAL CONGRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Head Quarters, Morristown, April 5, 1777.\r\n\r\nGentlemen:\r\n\r\nSince my last I have had the pleasure of receiving your reply to my\r\ntwo favors of the 29th ultimo and 2d current. I am happy enough to be\r\nable to inform you, that my indisposition, which was the occasion of my\r\nbrevity when I last wrote, is now removed.\r\n\r\nThe opinion I advanced respecting the enemy’s not moving before the\r\nbeginning of May, seems to be shaken, though not entirely overthrown,\r\nby some present appearances. We have received information that they are\r\nembarking about three thousand men on board of transports, which are\r\nlying at the Hook, by way of Staten Island. This, it is conjectured,\r\nis with a view to the Delaware; and the supposition is confirmed, by\r\nthe circumstance of a confederacy lately detected at Philadelphia,\r\nwho, among other things, were endeavoring, by the temptation of\r\nfifty pounds, to engage persons as pilots up that river. The extreme\r\ndifficulties they must labor under for want of forage, and the infinite\r\nhazard they must run by moving with a small body of about five thousand\r\nmen, with an enemy in the rear, incapable of sparing any considerable\r\nbody of troops to form a post behind, and be an asylum to them in case\r\nof accident,--these circumstances will hardly allow me to think they\r\nwill be daring enough to make the attempt at this time. But on the\r\nother hand, as they know we are in a progressive state as to numbers,\r\nand other matters of importance, and as they have no prospect of early\r\nreinforcement, and are in a state of uncertainty as to any, from the\r\nbustling aspect of European affairs, it is probable they may conceive\r\na necessity of making a push at all risks. Perhaps, however, this\r\nembarkation is intended for some other purpose; to make a diversion,\r\nor execute some partisan exploit elsewhere. On the whole, I find it\r\ndifficult to believe they are yet ready for any capital operation.\r\n\r\nAs to your apprehensions of an attempt up the North river, I imagine\r\nyou may discard any uneasiness on that score, although it will be at\r\nall times advisable to be on the watch against such a contingency.\r\nIt is almost reduced to a certainty, that the principal views of the\r\nenemy, in the ensuing campaign, will be directed towards the southward,\r\nand to Philadelphia more immediately; of which idea, the discovery\r\nbefore mentioned, with respect to pilots, is no inconsiderable\r\nconfirmation. Philadelphia is an object calculated to strike and\r\nattract their attention. It has all along been the main source of\r\nsupplies towards the war; and the getting it into their possession,\r\nwould deprive us of a wheel we could very badly spare, in the great\r\npolitical and military machine. They are sensible of this, and are\r\nequally sensible, that it contains, in itself, and is surrounded by,\r\na prodigious number of persons attached to them, and inimical to us,\r\nwho would lend them all the assistance they could, in the further\r\nprosecution of their designs. It is also a common and well-grounded\r\nrule in war, to strike first and principally, at the capital towns and\r\ncities, in order to the conquest of a country.\r\n\r\nI must confess I do not see any object equally interesting to draw\r\ntheir efforts to the northward. Operations merely for plundering and\r\ndevastation can never answer their end; and if they could, one part of\r\nthe continent would do nearly as well as another. And as to the notion\r\nof forming a junction with the northern army, and cutting off the\r\ncommunication between the northern and southern States, I apprehend it\r\nwill do better in speculation than in practice. Unless the geography\r\nof the country is far different from any thing I can conceive, to\r\neffect this would require a chain of posts, and such a number of men at\r\neach, as would never be practicable or maintainable, but to an immense\r\narmy. In their progress, by hanging upon their rear, and seizing\r\nevery opportunity of skirmishing, their situation might be rendered\r\ninsupportably uneasy.\r\n\r\nBut for fear of mistake, the General has determined to collect a\r\nconsiderable body of troops at or about Peekskill, which will not be\r\ndrawn off till the intentions of the enemy have acquired a decisive\r\ncomplexion. These will be ready, according to conjunctures, either to\r\nproceed northerly or southerly, as may be requisite. Every precaution\r\nshould be taken to prevent the boats from being destroyed, by\r\ncollecting them, at the first movement of the enemy, under cover of\r\none of the forts, or into some inlet, difficult of access, and easily\r\ndefensible with a small number of men. The loss of them would be an\r\nirreparable disadvantage.\r\n\r\nThe enemy’s attempt upon Peekskill is a demonstration of the folly\r\nof having any quantity of stores at places so near the water, and so\r\nmuch exposed to a sudden inroad. There should never be more there than\r\nsufficient to answer present demands. We have lost a good deal in this\r\nway at different times, and I hope experience will at last make us\r\nwiser.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency lately had a visit from the Oneida Chief and five\r\nothers. He managed them with a good deal of address, and sent them\r\naway perfectly satisfied. He persuaded them to go to Philadelphia, but\r\nthey declined it, alleging their impatience to return, and remove the\r\nerroneous opinions of their countrymen, from the misrepresentations of\r\nBritish emissaries, which they were apprehensive might draw them into\r\nsome rash proceedings. They parted, after having made the most solemn\r\nprotestations of friendship and good will. His Excellency has been very\r\nbusy all day in dispatching the southern post, which has prevented me\r\ngiving him your resolve. It will, no doubt, be very acceptable; and\r\nit is with pleasure I inform you, that the zeal and abilities of the\r\nNew-York Convention hold the first rank in his estimation.\r\n\r\nNo news from France, save that the Congress have obtained a credit\r\nthere, for which they can draw bills to the amount of £100,000\r\nsterling. This will be extremely serviceable in carrying on a trade\r\nwith the French. The new troops begin to come in. If we can shortly get\r\nany considerable accession of strength, we may be able to strike some\r\nbrilliant stroke.\r\n\r\n                             I am, Gentlemen, with the greatest respect,\r\n                             Your most obedient servant,\r\n                             A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nP. S. We have been some time endeavoring to negotiate a regular cartel;\r\nbut it has been lately broken off, principally on account of Major\r\nGeneral Lee. General Howe will not allow him to be comprehended under\r\nthe general idea of American prisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMITTEE OF CONVENTION TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     Kingston, 8th April, 1777.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nYours of the third came safe to hand this day, and gave us great\r\npleasure by certifying your health. The smallness of our numbers\r\nwill not permit the loss of one useful citizen. It is, therefore, a\r\ndetermined point, that, sick or well, you are by no means to die.\r\n\r\nAt this distance, it is impossible to determine what the enemy can, or\r\nwhat they cannot, do. But, certainly, if we can bring a respectable\r\nforce into the field previous to their movements, it must be extremely\r\ndifficult for them to advance or retreat. The latter, indeed, may be\r\nassisted by the works they are throwing up.\r\n\r\nTheir attempt upon the Delaware is far from improbable. Howe is\r\ncertainly a stupid fellow: but if he reasons so far, the taking of\r\nPhiladelphia would give a splendid sight to their manœuvres in the\r\neyes of Europe. This would be productive of advantage. The seizing that\r\nlarge city, would also afford him much benefit in the several ways\r\nwhich you suggest. But would it not be wise to permit his force to be\r\nthus divided, that one part after another might be cut to pieces?\r\n\r\nSince the affair at Peekskill, their views this way seem to be less\r\nprobable. It was, doubtless, unmilitary to warn us of our danger. They\r\nwill also soon learn that we are in this quarter, in a decent posture\r\nof defence; and that may decide their fluctuating councils.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, after all, they will find it more convenient to keep post at\r\nAmboy, with an advanced party at Brunswick, secure New-York, and carry\r\non a kind of naval partisan war, till the further aid and order of\r\ntheir masters.\r\n\r\nYou will take care, whenever you write to us matters which ought not\r\nto be seen by all, to direct to _one_ of _us_ only in a separate\r\nletter: while that which is merely indifferent, comes under your usual\r\ndirection. The reason is, that sometimes, when we do not happen to be\r\nimmediately in the way, your letters are opened by the President; and\r\nalthough no evil consequences have accrued from this as yet, it is\r\nnevertheless proper to guard against it.\r\n\r\nWhat you say relative to a cartel, reminds us of the case of Major\r\nEdminston, who was taken by General Schuyler at the same time with Sir\r\nJohn Johnson. This gentleman, as His Excellency will recollect, was\r\nsent into the enemy’s quarters, with a letter to negotiate an exchange\r\nfor one of three Majors, prisoners in their hands. He hath since\r\nreturned, with a letter from Howe to General Schuyler, purporting that\r\none of those Majors shall be exchanged for him, he being permitted\r\nto join his regiment in Canada. He was three weeks, or thereabouts,\r\ntravelling from New-York to Albany; of which the Convention being\r\ninformed, caused him to be made prisoner, and intend sending him to\r\nHead Quarters. He is well acquainted with the face of this country, and\r\nthe disposition of its several inhabitants. He has sufficient interest\r\nwith the Indians to accomplish an escape. Upon the whole (as it will\r\nnot be prudent to confine him within this State), it is submitted,\r\nwhether it would not be proper to secure him elsewhere until the close\r\nof the present campaign?\r\n\r\n                                     We are, Sir,\r\n                                     Your most ob’t and humble servants,\r\n                                     Robt. R. Livingston,\r\n                                     Gouv. Morris.\r\n\r\nColonel Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD STIRLING TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   Baskenridge, April 12, 1777.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nThe troops under Colonel McClanagan, which I expected at their quarters\r\nbetween the first and second mountains yesterday, I find took the\r\nroute by Pluckamin and lodged there last night. I sent this morning at\r\ndaybreak a messenger to bring them into the Boundbrook Road at Boylans.\r\nI understand Col. Spotswood’s regiment is on the march by the same\r\nroute.\r\n\r\nThe time of Capt. James Scott’s company will expire the 14th. Lieut.\r\nKidgelow and the bulk of the men have behaved very well; as they can\r\nnow be spared, I believe it will be best that I be furnished with His\r\nExcellency’s dismission of them by the day.\r\n\r\nI wrote to His Excellency on Thursday last about the appointment of\r\nWilcocks. If he is approved of I wish you would get both Mr. Williams\r\nand him in orders, and that you would be so good as to write him to\r\ncome to me.\r\n\r\nIf there be any thing in General Orders within these two or three days\r\nthat can relate to the troops here, I should be glad to have a copy of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n                                        I am, very sincerely,\r\n                                        Your affectionate humble servt.,\r\n                                        Stirling.\r\n\r\nColonel Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMITTEE OF CONVENTION TO HAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    Kingston, 16th April, 1777.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nWe are directed, by Convention, to inclose a Resolution passed this\r\nday, in addition to that of the first of April, which we before did\r\nourselves the honor to transmit to His Excellency, by which we hope to\r\nput an effectual stop to any further desertions to the enemy; as the\r\ndisaffected have been hitherto greatly emboldened by their having, for\r\nthe want of courts, escaped the punishment they deserved. It frequently\r\nhappens, that ignorant young lads are seduced to enlist with the enemy,\r\nand are taken in their way to them. We have sometimes thought that such\r\nmight safely be admitted to enlist in our regiments (which they are\r\ngenerally inclined to do), as a change of company will often make an\r\nalteration in their sentiments, in which case a useful number may be\r\npreserved to the community. We wish you to consult the General on this\r\nsubject, and to favor us with his opinion, by which we shall regulate\r\nour future conduct relative to such persons.\r\n\r\nWe are obliged to you for communicating by Mr. Troop, an account of the\r\nengagement of Sunday, in which we equally admire the extreme caution\r\nof the enemy, and the spirit of that handful of men by whom they were\r\nopposed. The same bravery will, we hope, prove as fortunate, when a\r\nfairer occasion offers for its exertion. We have daily information of\r\nplots that are formed in this State; and a few days ago apprehended a\r\nColonel who was raising a regiment for the service of the enemy. We\r\nhope, by a seasonable severity, to prevent this evil from becoming very\r\nextensive.\r\n\r\n                                                        We are, Sir, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO LIVINGSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Head Quarters, Morristown, April 29, 1777.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nThe inclosed was intended to be sent with the prisoners mentioned in\r\nthe list; but before this could be conveniently done, Mr. Sims, one\r\nof the Chief Justices of the State, came to this town, and informed\r\nme, that the Governor and Council were upon the point of adjourning;\r\nand that the sending of the prisoners to them, would only be an\r\nembarrassment, without answering, at present, any valuable purpose. He\r\nconsidered himself authorized to take the matter under his direction,\r\nand desired a sight of the papers relating to it. After perusing them,\r\nhe determined it was best the prisoners should remain here, until he\r\nshould receive your further orders on the subject; and delivered me a\r\nletter for you, containing a representation of their cases, as they\r\nappear to him, in order to know your sense, in what manner they shall\r\nbe disposed of.\r\n\r\nHe admits two of them, Woolverton and Silas Howel, to bail.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the former, I send you a second list of four others that\r\nhave been lately committed to jail. These are high offenders, and among\r\nthe number of those who it were to be wished could have an immediate\r\ntrial and punishment. Isaac Ogden, in particular, is one of the most\r\nbarefaced impudent fellows that ever came under my observation. He\r\nopenly acknowledged himself a subject of the King of Great Britain; and\r\nflatly refused to give any satisfaction to some questions that were\r\nput to him respecting one Moses Nichols, an emissary from the enemy;\r\nassigning no other reason for his refusal, than that he had given his\r\nword to be silent.\r\n\r\nA spirit of disaffection shows itself with so much boldness and\r\nviolence in different parts of this State, that it is the ardent wish\r\nof His Excellency, no delay, which can be avoided, might be used in\r\nmaking examples of some of the most atrocious offenders. If something\r\nbe not speedily done, to strike a terror into the disaffected, the\r\nconsequences must be very disagreeable.\r\n\r\nAmong others, all security to the friends of the American cause will\r\nbe destroyed; and the natural effect of this, will be an extinction of\r\nzeal in seconding and promoting it. Their attachment, if it remain,\r\nwill be a dead, inactive, useless principle. And the disaffected,\r\nemboldened by impunity, will be encouraged to proceed to the most\r\ndangerous and pernicious lengths.\r\n\r\n                             I have the honor to be, with great respect,\r\n                             Your Excellency’s most ob’t servant,\r\n                             A. Hamilton, A. D. C.\r\n\r\nTo Gov. Livingston.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHUGH KNOX TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                             St. Croix, April 31, 1777.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Friend:\r\n\r\nA pretty fair opportunity just offering for Philadelphia, I could\r\nnot omit acknowledging the receipt of your very circumstantial and\r\nsatisfactory letter of the 14th February. The thing has happened\r\nwhich I wished for. We have been amazed here by vague, imperfect,\r\nand very false accounts of matters from the Continent: and I always\r\ntold my friends, that if you survived the campaign, and had an hour\r\nof leisure to write to me, I expected a more true, circumstantial,\r\nand satisfactory account of matters in your letter, than by all the\r\npublic papers and private intelligence we had received here. I have\r\nbut a moment to command at present, and have not time to remark\r\nupon your letter. I can only inform you, that it has given high\r\nsatisfaction to all friends here. We rejoice in your _good character_\r\nand _advancement_, which is, indeed, only the just reward of merit. May\r\nyou still live to deserve more and more from the friends of America,\r\nand to justify the choice, and merit the approbation, of the GREAT AND\r\nGOOD GENERAL WASHINGTON--a name which will shine with distinguished\r\nlustre in the annals of history--a name dear to the friends of the\r\nLiberties of Mankind! _Mark this_: You must be the Annalist and\r\nBiographer, as well as the Aide-de-Camp, of General Washington--and\r\nthe Historiographer of the AMERICAN WAR! I take the liberty to insist\r\non this. I hope you take minutes and keep a Journal! If you have not\r\nhitherto, I pray do it henceforth. I seriously, and with all my little\r\ninfluence, urge this upon you. This may be a new and strange thought\r\nto you: but if you survive the present troubles, _I aver_--few men\r\nwill be as well qualified to write the history of the present glorious\r\nstruggle. God only knows how it may terminate. But however that may be,\r\nit will be a most interesting story.\r\n\r\nI congratulate you on your recovery from a long and dangerous illness.\r\nIt is my own case--I am just convalescent, after the severest attack\r\nI ever had in my life. I hope to write you more at large soon, and\r\nremain, with the tender of every kind and friendly wish,\r\n\r\n                                              My dear Sir,\r\n                                              Your affectionate servant,\r\n                                              Hugh Knox.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO WILLIAM DUER.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Head Quarters, Morristown, 6th May, 1777.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nThe bearer of this is Mr. Malmedi, a French gentleman of learning,\r\nabilities, and experience. I believe he thinks himself entitled\r\nto preferment, and comes to Congress for that purpose. At the\r\nrecommendation of General Lee, he was made Brigadier General by the\r\nState of Rhode Island; and filled the station to the satisfaction of\r\nhis employers, as appears by a letter from Governor Cook, speaking\r\nof him in the highest terms of approbation. This has led him to hope\r\nthat he should be adopted by the Continent on an equal footing. But\r\nin this he will, no doubt, be mistaken, as there are many insuperable\r\nobjections to such an event. Among others, it would tend to raise\r\nthe expectations of the Frenchmen in general, already too high, to a\r\npitch which it would be impossible to gratify or endure. It might not,\r\nhowever, be amiss to do whatever propriety would warrant to keep him\r\nin good humor, as he is a man of sense and merit. I think policy would\r\njustify the advancing him a step higher than his former Continental\r\nrank.\r\n\r\nCongress, in the beginning, went upon a very injudicious plan with\r\nrespect to Frenchmen. To every adventurer that came, without even\r\nthe shadow of credentials, they gave the rank of Field officers.\r\nThis circumstance, seconding the aspiring disposition natural to\r\nthose people, carried the expectations of those who had really any\r\npretensions to the character of officers, to a length that exceeds all\r\nthe bounds of moderation. As it was impossible to pursue this impolitic\r\nplan, the Congress have begun to retrench their excessive liberality;\r\nand the consequence has been, universal disgust and discontent.\r\n\r\nIt would, perhaps, be injurious, as the French are much addicted\r\nto national punctilio, to run into the opposite extreme to that\r\nfirst embraced, and, by that mean, create a general clamor and\r\ndissatisfaction. Policy suggests the propriety of discriminating a few\r\nof the most deserving, and endeavoring to keep them in temper, even by\r\ngratifying them beyond what they can reasonably pretend to. This will\r\nenable us to shake off the despicable part with safety, and to turn\r\na deaf ear to the exorbitant demands of the many. It will easily be\r\nbelieved in France that their want of merit occasioned their want of\r\nsuccess, from the extraordinary marks of favor that have been conferred\r\non others: whereas, the united voice of complaint from the whole, might\r\nmake ill impressions in their own country, which it is not our interest\r\nshould exist.\r\n\r\nWe are already greatly embarrassed with the Frenchmen among us; and,\r\nfrom the genius of the people, shall continue to be so. It were to be\r\nwished, that our agents in France, instead of courting them to come\r\nout, were instructed to give no encouragement but where they could\r\nnot help it; that is, where applications were made to them by persons\r\ncountenanced and supported by great men, whom it would be impolitic to\r\ndisoblige. Be assured, Sir, we shall never be able to satisfy them; and\r\nthey can be of no use to us, at least for some time. Their ignorance\r\nof our language; of the disposition of the people; the resources and\r\ndeficiencies of the country; their own habits and tempers: all these\r\nare disqualifications that put it out of their power to be of any real\r\nservice to us. You will consider what I have said entirely as my own\r\nsentiments, and,\r\n\r\n                                     Believe me, with great regard, Sir,\r\n                                     Your most obedient servant,\r\n                                     A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nWilliam Duer, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOUVERNEUR MORRIS TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      Kingston, 16th May, 1777.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nI had the pleasure of your two favors within two days of each other,\r\nand am very happy to find that our form of government meets with your\r\napprobation. That there are faults in it is not to be wondered at, for\r\nit is the work of men, and of men, perhaps, not the best qualified\r\nfor such undertakings. I think it deficient, for the want of vigor\r\nin the executive; unstable, from the very nature of popular elective\r\ngovernments; and dilatory, from the complexity of the legislature.\r\n\r\nFor the first, I apologize by hinting the spirit which now reigns in\r\nAmerica, suspiciously cautious. For the second, because unavoidable.\r\nFor the third, because a simple legislature soon possesses itself of\r\ntoo much power for the safety of its subjects. God grant it may work\r\nwell, for we must live under it.\r\n\r\nI cannot persuade myself that Howe will either go to Philadelphia or\r\ncome hither. In either case, General Washington can hang upon his\r\nrear, and place him in the light rather of a fugitive than a conqueror.\r\nIf he bends his efforts this way, the Council of Safety, you may\r\ndepend upon it, will exert themselves to make his situation as uneasy\r\nas he would wish; probably more so. The spirit of the Tories, we have\r\ngreat reason to believe, is entirely broken in this State. If it is\r\nnot, it will soon be so; for they shall have a few more executions,\r\nthan which nothing can be more efficacious. I speak from experience:\r\nbut then it is necessary to disperse the victims of public justice\r\nthroughout different parts of the several States; for nothing but\r\nocular demonstration can convince these incredulous beings that we do\r\nreally hang them. I wish the several States would follow our example.\r\nPennsylvania, in particular, would experience many good effects from a\r\nvigorous manly executive. Adieu.\r\n\r\n                                  Your most obedient and humble servant,\r\n                                  Gouv. Morris.\r\n\r\nCol. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOUV. MORRIS TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      Kingston, 24th May, 1777.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nYou certainly had no reason to complain of me, for not informing you\r\nof the destruction of the stores at St. John’s. True it is, we had\r\na vague report of such a transaction; and we had also an account,\r\nfrom private persons, that the report was confirmed at Albany: but\r\nGeneral Gates has never done us the honor to make us acquainted with\r\nhis intelligence upon that subject; and therefore I was not really\r\nwarranted to say any thing about it. Apropos, I shall lose two beaver\r\nhats if our troops are not in possession of New-York by the first day\r\nof July next. If the enemy expect reinforcements, prudence will dictate\r\nto us to do something offensive as soon as possible. Would it not\r\nbe prudent to make several attacks at the same time? For instance,\r\nabout Hackensack, Bergen, or wherever else the enemy are in that\r\nquarter: upon Brunswick, by way of Round Brook, Bonumtown, and from the\r\nsouthward: upon Fort Independence in Westchester county, or against\r\nHarlæm: and upon Long Island, by throwing over some of the eastern\r\ntroops. If only one should prove successful, it would give splendor to\r\nour arms, and dismay the enemy. But our numbers, &c., &c., must govern\r\nthese things. Howe certainly cannot mean to come this way, unless he is\r\nconsiderably reinforced. He will, unless he is to act on the defensive.\r\nI hope that our Generals are very busy fortifying the passes in the\r\nHighlands. I fear we shall destroy many men by it when the weather\r\ngrows warm. Much fatigue prevents that attention to cleanliness which\r\nis essential to the health of soldiery. Soldiers should, in my opinion,\r\nbe as much exercised in the use of arms, and the various evolutions,\r\nas is necessary to preserve their bodies in a state of strength and\r\nelasticity. The rest of their time may be usefully employed in the care\r\nof their clothes, and collecting refreshments. I seriously believe,\r\nthat if two armies of thirty thousand men each, were to take the field\r\nin May, and the one be employed in building fortifications for three\r\nmonths, which the other should storm at the expiration of that term;\r\nthe odds would be in favor of the assailants, that the campaign would\r\nnot cost them as many as the enemy. But a truce to idle speculation.\r\nBe pleased to direct your next letter to Robert R. Livingston and\r\nChristopher Tapin, Esqrs., as I shall not myself be in the way to\r\nreceive it. We have no news here but this, that the tories are much\r\nhumbled, and will, I believe, be more so.\r\n\r\n                                                  Adieu. Yours,\r\n                                                  Gouv. Morris.\r\n\r\nCol. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Head Quarters, Smith’s Clove, July 22, 1777.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nYour favor of the eighteenth, from Saratoga, reached me yesterday. Your\r\npronouncing Fort Edward, among the other forts, indefensible, surprises\r\nme a little, as it is entirely contrary to the representations of\r\nseveral gentlemen of judgment, who have had an opportunity of seeing\r\nand considering its situation; by whom we have been taught to believe\r\nthat it would be an excellent post, at least for checking and retarding\r\nBurgoyne’s progress. I agree with you that our principal strength in\r\nthe quarter you are, will be in the forests and natural strength of\r\nthe country, and in the want of forage, provisions, carriages, &c., in\r\nwhich the enemy may easily be thrown, by taking away what there are of\r\nthose articles, which, you observe, have never been in great abundance.\r\n\r\nI am doubtful whether Burgoyne will attempt to penetrate far, and\r\nwhether he will not content himself with harassing our back settlements\r\nby parties assisted by the savages, who, it is to be feared, will\r\npretty generally be tempted, by the enemy’s late successes, to\r\nconfederate in hostilities against us.\r\n\r\nThis doubt arises from some appearances that indicate a southern\r\nmovement of General Howe’s army, which, if it should really happen,\r\nwill certainly be a barrier against any further impressions of\r\nBurgoyne; for it cannot be supposed he would be rash enough to plunge\r\ninto the bosom of the country without an expectation of being met by\r\nGeneral Howe. Things must prove very adverse to us indeed, should he\r\nmake such an attempt and _not be ruined by it._ I confess, however,\r\nthat the appearances I allude to do not carry a full evidence in my\r\nmind; because they are opposed by others of a contradictory kind;\r\nand because I cannot conceive upon what principle of common sense,\r\nor military propriety, Howe can be running away from Burgoyne to the\r\nsouthward.\r\n\r\nIt is much to be wished he may, even though it should give him the\r\npossession of Philadelphia, which by our remoteness from it, may\r\nvery well happen. In this case, we may not only, if we think proper,\r\nretaliate, by aiming a stroke at New-York; but we may come upon him\r\nwith the greatest part of our collective force, to act against that\r\npart which is under him. We shall then be certain that Burgoyne\r\ncannot proceed, and that a small force of continental troops will be\r\nsufficient for that partisan war which he must carry on the rest of the\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nA small force will also be sufficient to garrison the posts in the\r\nHighlands, and prevent any danger there; so that we shall be able\r\nto bring nearly the whole of the continental army against Mr. Howe.\r\nThe advantages of this are obvious. Should he be satisfied with the\r\nsplendor of his acquisition, and shut himself up in Philadelphia, we\r\ncan ruin him by confinement. Should he leave a garrison there, and go\r\nforward, we can either fall upon that or his main body, diminished\r\nas it will be by such a measure, with our whole force. There will,\r\nhowever, be many disagreeable consequences attending such an event;\r\namongst which, the foremost is, the _depreciation of our currency_,\r\nwhich, from the importance in which Philadelphia is held, cannot fail\r\nto ensue.\r\n\r\n                                             I am, dear Sir,\r\n                                             Your most obedient servant,\r\n                                             Alex. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO DR. KNOX.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * This event [the evacuation of Ticonderoga[1]], redounds very\r\nlittle to our credit. For if the post was untenable, or required a\r\nlarger number of troops to defend it than could be spared for the\r\npurpose, it ought long ago to have been foreseen and given up. Instead\r\nof that, we have kept a large quantity of cannon in it, and have been\r\nheaping up very valuable magazines of stores and provisions, that, in\r\nthe critical moment of defence, are abandoned and lost. This affair\r\nwill be attended with several evil consequences; for besides the\r\nloss of our stores, which we cannot well afford, it opens a new and\r\neasy door by which to penetrate the northern States. It will fix the\r\nhitherto fluctuating disposition of the Indians in that quarter in\r\ntheir favor, and expose the frontiers of the adjacent country to their\r\ndepredations. But though it is a misfortune we have reason to lament,\r\nI dare say it will be regarded with you as much more important than\r\nit really is, and as materially endangering the success of our cause,\r\nwhich is by no means the case. Our opposition is at this time too well\r\nmatured, and has too great stability, to be shaken by an accident of\r\nthat kind. While we have a respectable army in the field, and resources\r\nto feed, clothe, and arm them, we are safe. We have had a force\r\nsufficient for the foregoing part of the campaign, to maintain such a\r\nsuperiority over the main army of the enemy as effectually to hinder\r\nthem from attaining any of their purposes. And, to the northward,\r\nwith the reinforcements sent up to succor the retreating garrison of\r\nTiconderoga, and the militia flocking in from New England, I think\r\nthere is little doubt we have by this time a force adequate to give\r\nMr. Burgoyne a seasonable check. One good effect will result from the\r\nmisfortune, which is, that it will stimulate the eastern States to\r\ngreater exertions than they might otherwise make.\r\n\r\nBy our last advices, the enemy were in possession of all the country\r\nbetween Ticonderoga and Fort George; and our army, nearly equal in\r\nnumber to them, were about to take post somewhere between Fort Edward\r\nand Saratoga.\r\n\r\nThe consequences of this northern affair will depend much upon the part\r\nthat Howe acts. If he were to co-operate with Burgoyne, it would demand\r\nour utmost efforts to counteract them. But if he should go towards the\r\nsouthward, all or most of the advantages of Burgoyne’s success will be\r\nlost. He will either be obliged to content himself with the possession\r\nof Ticonderoga, and the dependent fortresses, and with carrying on a\r\npartisan war the rest of the campaign; or he must precipitate himself\r\ninto certain ruin, by attempting to advance into the country with a\r\nvery incompetent force. Appearances lead us to suppose that Howe is\r\nfool enough to meditate a southern expedition; for he has now altered\r\nhis station at Staten Island, mentioned above, and has fallen down to\r\nthe Hook. Judging it morally certain that there would be a co-operation\r\nof the two armies, we thought it expedient to march northerly; and had\r\naccordingly reached within fourteen miles of New Windsor, the place\r\nwhere we could cross the North River without danger or interruption.\r\nBut this new movement of the enemy’s fleet, has induced us to return\r\na few miles, and make a disposition for marching southerly. We shall,\r\nhowever, be cautious how we proceed on that course, lest nothing more\r\nthan a feint is intended, to divert us from the real object.\r\n\r\nIf they go to the southward in earnest, they must have the capture\r\nof Philadelphia in view; for there is no other inducement. We shall\r\nendeavor to get there in time to oppose them; and shall have the\r\nprincipal part of the continental force, and a large body of spirited\r\nmilitia, many of them, from their services during the last campaign,\r\npretty well inured to arms, to make the opposition with. Yet I would\r\nnot have you to be much surprised if Philadelphia should fall; for the\r\nenemy will doubtless go there with a determination to succeed at all\r\nhazard; and we shall not be able to prevent them, without risking a\r\ngeneral action, the expediency of which will depend upon circumstances.\r\nIf the militia turn out with that zeal we have a right to expect, from\r\ntheir conduct when the enemy made their last experiment in the Jersies,\r\nand were supposed to be going to Philadelphia, we may do it without\r\nmuch inconvenience. If they fall materially short of it, we shall\r\nbe obliged to confine ourselves to a skirmishing opposition, which\r\nwe cannot expect will be effectual. It may be asked, If, to avoid a\r\ngeneral engagement, we give up objects of the first importance, what is\r\nto hinder the enemy from carrying every important point, and ruining\r\nus? My answer is, that our hopes are not placed in any particular city\r\nor spot of ground, but in the preserving a good army, furnished with\r\nproper necessaries, to take advantage of favorable opportunities, and\r\nwaste and defeat the enemy by piecemeal. Every new post they take,\r\nrequires a new division of their forces, and enables us to strike with\r\nour united force against a part of theirs: and such is their present\r\nsituation, that another Trenton affair will amount to a complete\r\nvictory on our part; for they are at too low an ebb to bear another\r\nstroke of the kind. Perhaps, before I may have an opportunity of\r\nsending this, facts will unfold what I am now endeavoring to anticipate\r\nby conjecture.\r\n\r\nYou will expect some animadversions on the temper and views of the\r\nFrench nation. I presume you are nearly as well acquainted with the\r\nassistance they are giving us as I am, both by their intrigues in\r\nforeign courts, and by supplies of every kind of warlike stores and\r\napparatus.\r\n\r\nIt does not admit of a doubt that they are interested to wish us\r\nsuccess; and their conduct plainly shows, they are willing to give us\r\nevery aid essential to our preservation. But it is natural they should\r\ndesire to do it with as much convenience to themselves as they can.\r\nI apprehend they are not over fond of plunging themselves into a war\r\nwith England if they can avoid it, and still answer the end they have\r\nto pursue: and, indeed, from the evident reluctance shown on the part\r\nof the latter, to do any thing that may bring about such an event, it\r\nbecomes extremely difficult to draw her into it. The conclusion we may\r\nmake, is, that France will not wish to force England into a war, unless\r\nshe finds our affairs require it absolutely; and England will not enter\r\ninto one, till she is compelled to do it.\r\n\r\nMy best respects to all friends; and I beg you will believe me to be,\r\nwith unabated regard,\r\n\r\n                                             Dear Sir,\r\n                                             Your most obedient servant,\r\n                                             A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] July 5, 1777.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                         Sept. 18, 1777.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nIf Congress have not left Philadelphia, they ought to do it immediately\r\nwithout fail; for the enemy have the means of throwing a party this\r\nnight into the city. I just now passed the Valley Ford--in doing which\r\na party of the enemy came down and fired upon us in the boat, by which\r\nmeans I lost my horse--one man was killed, and another wounded. The\r\nboats were abandoned, and will fall into their hands. I did all I could\r\nto prevent this, but to no purpose.\r\n\r\n                                        I have the honor to be,\r\n                                        With much respect,\r\n                                        Sir, your most obedient servant,\r\n                                        A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nTo Hon. John Hancock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HONORABLE JOHN HANCOCK, PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 September 18, 1777, 9 o’clock at night.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nI did myself the honor to write you a hasty line this evening, giving\r\nit as my opinion, that the city was no longer a place of safety for\r\nyou. I write you again, lest that letter should not get to hand. The\r\nenemy are on the road to Swedes Ford, the main body about four miles\r\nfrom it. They sent a party this evening to Daviser’s ferry, which\r\nfired upon me and some others in crossing it, killed one man, wounded\r\nanother, and disabled my horse.\r\n\r\nThey came on so suddenly, that one boat was left adrift on the other\r\nside, which will of course fall into their hands; and, by the help of\r\nthat, they will get possession of another, which was abandoned by those\r\nwho had the direction of it, and left afloat, in spite of every thing\r\nthat I could do to the contrary. These two boats will convey fifty men\r\nacross at a time, so that in a few hours they may throw over a large\r\nparty, perhaps sufficient to overmatch the militia who may be between\r\nthem and the city. This renders the situation of Congress extremely\r\nprecarious, if they are not on their guard: my apprehensions for them\r\nare great, though it is not improbable they may not be realized. The\r\nmost cogent reasons oblige me to join the army this night, or I should\r\nhave waited upon you myself. I am in hopes our army will be up with the\r\nenemy before they pass Schuylkill: if they are, something serious will\r\nensue.\r\n\r\n                                                I have the honor to be,\r\n                                                With much respect,\r\n                                                Sir, your most obedient,\r\n                                                A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Philadelphia, 22d September, 1777.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nI left camp last evening, and came to this city to superintend the\r\ncollection of blankets and clothing for the army. Mr. Lovell sends to\r\ninform me there is an express going off to Congress; and I do myself\r\nthe honor to communicate a brief state of things when I left camp. The\r\nenemy moved yesterday, from where they lay opposite to Valley Forge,\r\n&c., higher up the river, on their old scheme of gaining our right. I\r\ndon’t know precisely where they halted; but our army was preparing to\r\nmove up also, to counteract them.\r\n\r\nI am this morning told, they marched about twelve o’clock at night for\r\nthat purpose. The general opinion was, that the enemy would attempt\r\ncrossing this day: every appearance justified the supposition.\r\n\r\nWe had intelligence that the enemy had, the night before last,\r\nsurprised Generals Smallwood and Wayne, and consequently dispersed\r\nthem, after a small opposition. The loss, it is said, was not great:\r\nand our troops were re-assembling fast at the Red Lion. This seems to\r\nhave been a bad look out, and is somewhat disconcerting.\r\n\r\nBy a letter from General McDougal, received this morning, it appears he\r\nwas, on the twentieth, in the morning, at Second River, just setting\r\nout on his march toward Woodbridge. He is pressing forward with all\r\npossible expedition. The troops were pretty well refreshed, and in good\r\nspirits.\r\n\r\n                                                   I have, &c.,\r\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n           Head Quarters, Philadelphia County, 30th Oct., 1777.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nIt having been judged expedient by the members of a council of war,\r\nheld yesterday, that one of the gentlemen of my family should be sent\r\nto General Gates, in order to lay before him the state of this army,\r\nand the situation of the enemy; and to point out to him the many happy\r\nconsequences that will accrue from an immediate reinforcement being\r\nsent from the northern army; I have thought it proper to appoint you to\r\nthat duty, and desire that you will immediately set out for Albany; at\r\nwhich place, or in the neighborhood, I imagine you will find General\r\nGates.\r\n\r\nYou are so fully acquainted with the principal points on which you\r\nare sent, namely, the state of our army, and the situation of the\r\nenemy, that I shall not enlarge on those heads. What you are chiefly\r\nto attend to, is to point out, in the clearest and fullest manner, to\r\nGeneral Gates, the absolute necessity that there is for his detaching\r\na very considerable part of the army at present under his command, to\r\nthe reinforcement of this; a measure that will, in all probability,\r\nreduce General Howe to the same situation in which General Burgoyne now\r\nis, should he attempt to remain in Philadelphia without being able to\r\nremove the obstructions in the Delaware, and open a free communication\r\nwith his shipping. The force which the members of the council of war\r\njudge it safe and expedient to draw down at present, are the three New\r\nHampshire and fifteen Massachusetts regiments, with Lee’s and Jackson’s\r\ntwo of the sixteen, additional. But it is more than probable that\r\nGeneral Gates may have detained part of those troops to the reduction\r\nof Ticonderoga, should the enemy not have evacuated it; or to the\r\ngarrisoning it. If they should, in that case the reinforcement will\r\nbe according to circumstances; but, if possible, let it be made up to\r\nthe same number out of other corps. If, upon your meeting with General\r\nGates, you should find that he intends, in consequence of his success,\r\nto employ the troops under his command upon some expedition, by the\r\nprosecution of which the common cause will be more benefited than by\r\ntheir being sent down to reinforce this army, it is not my wish to\r\ngive any interruption to the plan. But if he should have nothing more\r\nin contemplation than those particular objects which I have mentioned\r\nto you, and which it is unnecessary to commit to paper; in that case\r\nyou are to inform him, that it is my desire that the reinforcements\r\nbefore mentioned, or such parts of them as can be safely spared, be\r\nimmediately put in motion to join the army.\r\n\r\nI have understood that General Gates has already detached Nixon’s\r\nand Glover’s brigades to join General Putnam; and General Dickinson\r\ninforms me, Sir Henry Clinton has come down the river with his whole\r\nforce: if this be a fact, you are to desire General Putnam to send the\r\ntwo brigades forward with the greatest expedition, as there can be no\r\noccasion for them there.\r\n\r\nI expect you will meet Colonel Morgan’s corps upon their way down:\r\nif you do, let them know how essential their services are to us; and\r\ndesire the Colonel or commanding officer, to hasten their march as much\r\nas is consistent with the health of the men after their late fatigues.\r\n\r\n                                                                   G. W.\r\n\r\nP.S. I ordered the detachment belonging to General McDougal’s division\r\nto come forward. If you meet them, direct those belonging to Greene’s,\r\nAngel’s, Chandler’s, and Duryee’s regiments, not to cross Delaware, but\r\nto proceed to Red Bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        Fishkill, Nov. 2, 1777.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nI lodged last night in the neighborhood of New Windsor. This morning\r\nearly I met Colonel Morgan with his corps, about a mile from it, in\r\nmarch for head quarters. I told him the necessity of making all the\r\ndispatch he could, so as not to fatigue his men too much, which he has\r\npromised to do.\r\n\r\nI understood from Colonel Morgan, that all the northern army were\r\nmarching down on both sides the river, and would, probably, be\r\nto-morrow at New Windsor and this place; and that General Putnam had\r\nheld a council for the general disposition of them, in which it was\r\nresolved to send you four thousand men, and to keep the rest on this\r\nside the river. I came here in expectation that matters were in such\r\na train as to enable me to accomplish my errand without going any\r\nfurther, unless it should be to hasten the troops that were on their\r\nmarch: but on my arrival, I learned from Mr. Hughes, an Aid-de-Camp of\r\nGeneral Gates, that the following disposition of the northern army had\r\ntaken place.\r\n\r\nGeneral Patterson’s, Glover’s, and Nixon’s brigades, and Colonel\r\nWarner’s mountain boys, to remain in and about Albany: barracks\r\nbuilding for them. General Poor’s brigade, marching down this side of\r\nthe river to join General Putnam, will be here probably to-morrow.\r\nGeneral Learned’s brigade, Morgan’s corps, Warner’s brigade of\r\nMassachusetts militia, and some regiments of New-York militia, on their\r\nmarch on the west side of the river.\r\n\r\nI have directed General Putnam, in your name, to send forward, with\r\nall dispatch, to join you, the two continental brigades, and Warner’s\r\nmilitia brigade: this last is to serve till the latter end of this\r\nmonth. Your instructions did not comprehend any militia: but as there\r\nare certain accounts here, that most of the troops from New-York\r\nare gone to reinforce General Howe; and as so large a proportion of\r\ncontinental troops have been detained at Albany; I concluded you would\r\nnot disapprove of a measure calculated to strengthen you, though but\r\nfor a small time, and have ventured to adopt it on that presumption.\r\n\r\nBeing informed by General Putnam, that General Wynds, with seven\r\nhundred Jersey militia, was at King’s Ferry, with intention to cross to\r\nPeekskill, I prevailed upon him to relinquish that idea, and send off\r\nan immediate order for them to march towards Red Bank. It is possible,\r\nhowever, unless your Excellency supports this order by an application\r\nfrom yourself, he may march his men home, instead of marching them to\r\nthe place he has been directed to repair to.\r\n\r\nNeither Lee’s, Jackson’s regiments, nor the detachments belonging to\r\nGeneral McDougal’s division, have yet marched. I have urged their being\r\nsent; and an order has been dispatched for their instantly proceeding.\r\nColonel Hughes is pressing some fresh horses for me. The moment they\r\nare ready, I shall recross the river, in order to fall in with the\r\ntroops on the other side, and make all the haste I can to Albany, to\r\nget the three brigades there sent forward.\r\n\r\nWill your Excellency permit me to observe, that I have some doubts,\r\nunder present circumstances and appearances, of the propriety of\r\nleaving the regiments proposed to be left in this quarter? But if my\r\ndoubts on this subject were stronger than they are, I am forbid, by the\r\nsense of council, from interfering in the matter.\r\n\r\nGeneral Poor’s brigade is just arrived here: they will proceed to join\r\nyou with all expedition. So strongly am I impressed with the importance\r\nof endeavoring to crush Mr. Howe, that I am apt to think it would\r\nbe advisable to draw off all the continental troops. Had this been\r\ndetermined on, General Warner’s sixteen hundred militia might have been\r\nleft here.\r\n\r\n                                I have the honor to be,\r\n                                With the warmest esteem and respect,\r\n                                Your Excellency’s most obedient servant,\r\n                                A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        Albany, November, 1777.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nI arrived here yesterday at noon, and waited upon General Gates\r\nimmediately, on the business of my mission; but was sorry to find that\r\nhis ideas did not correspond with yours, for drawing off the number of\r\ntroops you directed. I used every argument in my power, to convince\r\nhim of the propriety of the measure; but he was inflexible in the\r\nopinion, that two brigades, at least, of continental troops, should\r\nremain in and near this place. His reasons were, that the intelligence\r\nof Sir Henry Clinton’s having gone to join Howe, was not sufficiently\r\nauthenticated to put it out of doubt; that there was, therefore, a\r\npossibility of his returning up the river, which might expose the\r\nfinest arsenal in America (as he calls the one here) to destruction,\r\nshould this place be left so bare of troops as I proposed; and that\r\nthe want of conveniencies, and the difficulty of the roads, would make\r\nit impossible to remove artillery and stores for a considerable time;\r\nthat the New England States would be left open to the depredations\r\nand ravages of the enemy; that it would put it out of his power to\r\nenterprise any thing against Ticonderoga, which he thinks might be done\r\nin the winter, and which he considers it of importance to undertake.\r\n\r\nThe force of these reasons did by no means strike me; and I did every\r\nthing in my power to show they were unsubstantial: but all I could\r\neffect, was to have one brigade dispatched, in addition to those\r\nalready marched. I found myself infinitely embarrassed, and was at a\r\nloss how to act. I felt the importance of strengthening you as much as\r\npossible: but, on the other hand, I found insuperable inconveniences,\r\nin acting diametrically opposite to the opinion of a gentleman, whose\r\nsuccesses have raised him to the highest importance. General Gates has\r\nwon the entire confidence of the Eastern States. If disposed to do it,\r\nby addressing himself to the prejudices of the people, he would find\r\nno difficulty to render a measure odious, which it might be said,\r\nwith plausibility enough to be believed, was calculated to expose them\r\nto unnecessary dangers, notwithstanding their exertions, during the\r\ncampaign, had given them the fullest title to repose and security.\r\nGeneral Gates has influence and interest elsewhere: he might use it,\r\nif he pleased, to discredit the measure there also. On the whole, it\r\nappeared to me dangerous, to insist on sending more troops from hence,\r\nwhile General Gates appeared so warmly opposed to it. Should any\r\naccident, or inconvenience, happen in consequence of it, there would be\r\ntoo fair a pretext for censure: and many people are too well disposed\r\nto lay hold of it. At any rate, it might be considered as using him\r\nill, to take a step so contrary to his judgment, in a case of this\r\nnature. These considerations, and others which I shall be more explicit\r\nin when I have the pleasure of seeing you, determined me not to insist\r\nupon sending either of the other brigades remaining here. I am afraid\r\nwhat I have done, may not meet with your approbation, as not being\r\nperhaps fully warranted by your instructions: but I ventured to do what\r\nI thought right, hoping that, at least, the goodness of my intention\r\nwill excuse the error of my judgment.\r\n\r\nI was induced to this relaxation the more readily, as I had directed\r\nto be sent on, two thousand militia, which were not expected by you;\r\nand a thousand continental troops out of those proposed to be left\r\nwith General Putnam, which I have written to him, since I found how\r\nmatters were circumstanced here, to forward to you with all dispatch.\r\nI did this for several reasons: because your reinforcement would be\r\nmore expeditious from that place than from this: because two thousand\r\ncontinental troops at Peekskill will not be wanted in its present\r\ncircumstances; especially as it was really necessary to have a body\r\nof continental troops at this place, for the security of the valuable\r\nstores here: and I should not, if I had my wish, think it expedient to\r\ndraw off more than two of the three brigades now here. This being the\r\ncase, one of the ends you proposed to be answered, by leaving the ten\r\nregiments with General Putnam, will be equally answered by the troops\r\nhere; I mean that of covering and fortifying the Eastern States: and\r\none thousand continental troops in addition to the militia collected,\r\nand that may be collected, here, will be sufficient, in the Highlands,\r\nfor covering the country down that way, and carrying on the works\r\nnecessary to be raised for the defence of the river.\r\n\r\nThe troops gone, and going, to reinforce you, are near five thousand\r\nrank and file, continental troops; and two thousand five hundred\r\nMassachusetts and New Hampshire militia. These and the seven hundred\r\nJersey militia, will be a larger reinforcement than you expected,\r\nthough not quite an equal number of continental troops; nor exactly\r\nin the way directed. General Lincoln tells me, the militia are very\r\nexcellent; and though their time will be out by the last of this month,\r\nyou will be able, if you think proper, to order the troops still\r\nremaining here, to join you by the time their term of service expires.\r\n\r\nI cannot forbear being uneasy, lest my conduct should prove displeasing\r\nto you: but I have done what, considering all circumstances, appeared\r\nto me most eligible and prudent.\r\n\r\nVessels are preparing to carry the brigade to New Windsor, which will\r\nembark this evening. I shall, this afternoon, set out on my return to\r\ncamp; and on my way, shall endeavor to hasten the troops forward.\r\n\r\n                                          I have the honor to be,\r\n                                          With great esteem and respect,\r\n                                          Your Excellency’s most ob’t,\r\n                                          Alex. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO GATES.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      Albany, November 5, 1777.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nBy inquiry, I have learned that General Patterson’s brigade, which is\r\nthe one you propose to send, is by far the weakest of the three now\r\nhere, and does not consist of more than about six hundred rank and file\r\nfit for duty. It is true, that there is a militia regiment with it of\r\nabout two hundred; but the time of service for which this regiment is\r\nengaged, is so near expiring, that it would be past by the time the\r\nmen could arrive at their destination.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, I cannot consider it either as compatible\r\nwith the good of the service, or my instructions from His Excellency\r\nGeneral Washington, to consent that that brigade be selected from the\r\nthree to go to him; but I am under the necessity of desiring, by virtue\r\nof my orders from him, that one of the others be substituted instead of\r\nthis; either General Nixon’s, or General Glover’s; and that you will be\r\npleased to give immediate orders for its embarkation.\r\n\r\nKnowing that General Washington wished me to pay the greatest deference\r\nto your judgment, I ventured so far to deviate from the instructions\r\nhe gave me, as to consent, in compliance with your opinion, that two\r\nbrigades should remain here instead of one. At the same time permit me\r\nto observe, that I am not myself sensible of the expediency of keeping\r\nmore than one, with the detached regiments in the neighborhood of this\r\nplace; and that my ideas coincide with those gentlemen whom I have\r\nconsulted on the occasion, whose judgment I have much more reliance\r\nupon than on my own, and who must be supposed to have a thorough\r\nknowledge of all the circumstances. Their opinion is, that one brigade,\r\nand the regiments before mentioned, would amply answer the purposes of\r\nthis post. When I preferred your opinion to other considerations, I did\r\nnot imagine you would pitch upon a brigade little more than half as\r\nlarge as the others: and finding this to be the case, I indispensably\r\nowe it to my duty, to desire, in His Excellency’s name, that another\r\nmay go instead of the one intended, and without loss of time. As it may\r\nbe conducive to dispatch, to send Glover’s brigade, if agreeable to\r\nyou, you will give orders accordingly.\r\n\r\n                                        I have the honor to be,\r\n                                        With real respect and esteem,\r\n                                        Sir, your most obedient servant,\r\n                                        A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nGeneral Gates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              New Windsor, November 10th, 1777.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nI arrived here last night from Albany. Having given General Gates a\r\nlittle time to recollect himself, I renewed my remonstrances on the\r\nnecessity and propriety of sending you more than one brigade of the\r\nthree he had detained with him; and finally prevailed upon him to give\r\norders for Glover’s in addition to Patterson’s brigade, to march this\r\nway.\r\n\r\nAs it was thought conducive to expedition, to send the troops by water,\r\nas far as it could be done, I procured all the vessels that could\r\nbe had at Albany, fit for the purpose; but could not get more than\r\nsufficient to take Patterson’s brigade. It was embarked the seventh\r\ninstant; but the wind has been contrary: they must probably be here\r\nto-day. General Glover’s brigade marched at the same time, on the east\r\nside of the river, the roads being much better than on this side. I am\r\nat this moment informed, that one sloop, with a part of Patterson’s,\r\nhas arrived, and that the others are in sight. They will immediately\r\nproceed, by water, to King’s Ferry, and thence take the shortest route.\r\n\r\nI am pained beyond expression to inform your Excellency, that on my\r\narrival here, I find every thing has been neglected and deranged by\r\nGeneral Putnam; and that the two brigades, Poor’s and Learned’s, still\r\nremain here and on the other side of the river at Fishkill. Colonel\r\nWarner’s militia, I am told, have been drawn to Peekskill, to aid in\r\nan expedition against New-York, which, it seems, is, at this time, the\r\nhobby-horse with General Putnam. Not the least attention has been paid\r\nto my order, in your name, for a detachment of one thousand men from\r\nthe troops hitherto stationed at this post. Every thing is sacrificed\r\nto the whim of taking New-York.\r\n\r\nThe two brigades of Poor and Learned, it appears, would not march for\r\nwant of money and necessaries; several of the regiments having received\r\nno pay for six or eight months past. There has been a high mutiny among\r\nthe former on this account, in which a captain killed a man, and was\r\nhimself shot by his comrade. These difficulties, for want of proper\r\nmanagement, have stopped the troops from proceeding. Governor Clinton\r\nhas been the only man who has done any thing towards removing them; but\r\nfor want of General Putnam’s co-operation, has not been able to effect\r\nit. He has only been able to prevail with Learned’s brigade, to agree\r\nto march to Goshen; in hopes, by getting them once on the go, to induce\r\nthem to continue their march. On coming here, I immediately sent for\r\nColonel Bailey, who now commands Learned’s brigade, and persuaded him\r\nto engage to carry the brigade on to head quarters as fast as possible.\r\nThis he expects to effect by means of five or six thousand dollars,\r\nwhich Governor Clinton was kind enough to borrow for me, and which\r\nColonel Bailey thinks will keep the men in good humor till they join\r\nyou. They marched this morning towards Goshen.\r\n\r\nI shall, as soon as possible, see General Poor, and do every thing in\r\nmy power to get him along; and hope I shall be able to succeed.\r\n\r\nThe plan I before laid, having been totally deranged, a new one has\r\nbecome necessary. It is now too late to send Warner’s militia; by the\r\ntime they reached you, their term of service would be out. The motive\r\nfor sending them, which was to give you a speedy reinforcement, has, by\r\nthe past delay, been superseded.\r\n\r\nBy Governor Clinton’s advice, I have sent an order, in the most\r\nemphatical terms, to General Putnam, immediately to dispatch all the\r\ncontinental troops under him to your assistance; and to detain the\r\nmilitia instead of them.\r\n\r\nMy opinion is, that the only present use for troops in this quarter,\r\nis, to protect the country from the depredations of little plundering\r\nparties; and for carrying on the works necessary for the defence of the\r\nriver. Nothing more ought to be thought of. ’Tis only wasting time, and\r\nmisapplying men, to employ them in a suicidal parade against New-York:\r\nfor in this it will undoubtedly terminate. New-York is no object, if\r\nit could be taken: and to take it, would require more men than could\r\nbe spared from more substantial purposes. Governor Clinton’s ideas\r\ncoincide with mine. He thinks that there is no need of more continental\r\ntroops here, than a few to give a spur to the militia in working upon\r\nthe fortifications. In pursuance of this I have given the directions\r\nbefore mentioned. If General Putnam attends to them, the troops under\r\nhim may be with you nearly as early as any of the others (though he\r\nhas, unluckily, marched them down to Tarrytown); and General Glover’s\r\nbrigade, when it gets up, will be more than sufficient to answer the\r\ntrue end of this post.\r\n\r\nIf your Excellency agrees with me in opinion, it will be well to send\r\ninstant directions to General Putnam, to pursue the object I have\r\nmentioned: for I doubt whether he will attend to any thing I shall say,\r\nnotwithstanding it comes in the shape of a positive order. I fear,\r\nunless you interpose, the works here will go on so feebly, for want of\r\nmen, that they will not be completed in time: whereas, it appears to me\r\nof the greatest importance they should be pushed with the utmost vigor.\r\nGovernor Clinton will do every thing in his power. I wish General\r\nPutnam was recalled from the command of this post, and Governor Clinton\r\nwould accept it: the blunders and caprices of the former are endless.\r\nBelieve me, Sir, nobody can be more impressed with the importance of\r\nforwarding the reinforcements coming to you, with all speed; nor could\r\nany body have endeavored to promote it more than I have done: but the\r\n_ignorance_ of some, and the _design_ of others, have been almost\r\ninsuperable obstacles. I am very unwell; but I shall not spare myself\r\nto get things immediately in a proper train; and for that purpose\r\nintend, unless I receive other orders from you, to continue with the\r\ntroops in the progress of their march. As soon as I get General Poor’s\r\nbrigade in march, I shall proceed to General Putnam’s at Peekskill.\r\n\r\n                                                I have, &c.,\r\n                                                Alex. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency, General Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                New Windsor, November 12, 1777.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nI have been detained here these two days by a fever, and violent\r\nrheumatic pains throughout my body. This has prevented my being\r\nactive, in person, for promoting the purposes of my errand; but I have\r\ntaken every other method in my power, in which Governor Clinton has\r\nobligingly given me all the aid he could. In answer to my pressing\r\napplication to General Poor, for the immediate marching of his brigade,\r\nI was told they were under an operation for the itch; which made it\r\nimpossible for them to proceed till the effects of it were over. By\r\na letter, however, of yesterday, General Poor informs me, he would\r\ncertainly march this morning. I must do him the justice to say, he\r\nappears solicitous to join you; and that I believe the past delay is\r\nnot owing to any fault of his, but is wholly chargeable on General\r\nPutnam. Indeed, Sir, I owe it to the service to say, that every part\r\nof this gentleman’s conduct is marked with blunder and negligence, and\r\ngives general disgust.\r\n\r\nParsons’ brigade will join you, I hope, in five or six days from this.\r\nLearned’s may do the same. Poor’s will, I am persuaded, make all the\r\nhaste they can for the future. And Glover’s may be expected at Fishkill\r\nto-night; whence they will be pressed forward as fast as I can have any\r\ninfluence to make them go. But I am sorry to say, the disposition for\r\nmarching, in the officers and men in general, of these troops, does not\r\nkeep pace with my wishes, or the exigency of the occasion. They have,\r\nunfortunately, imbibed an idea, that they have done their part of the\r\nbusiness of the campaign, and are now entitled to repose. This, and the\r\nwant of pay, make them averse to a long march at this advanced season.\r\n\r\n* * * In a letter from General Putnam, just now received by Governor\r\nClinton, he appears to have been, the 10th instant, at King’s Street,\r\nat the White Plains. I have had no answer to my last applications. The\r\nenemy appear to have stripped New-York very bare. The people there,\r\nthat is, the tories, are in a great fright: this adds to my anxiety,\r\nthat the reinforcements from this quarter to you are not in greater\r\nforwardness and more considerable.\r\n\r\nI have written to General Gates, informing him of the accounts of the\r\nsituation of New-York with respect to troops, and the probability of\r\nthe force gone to Howe being greater than was at first expected; to\r\ntry if this will not _extort_ from him a further reinforcement. I\r\ndon’t, however, expect much from him; as he pretends to have in view an\r\nexpedition against Ticonderoga, to be undertaken in the winter: and he\r\nknows that, under the sanction of this idea, calculated to catch the\r\neastern people, he may, without censure, retain the troops. And as I\r\nshall be under a necessity of speaking plainly to your Excellency, when\r\nI have the pleasure of seeing you, I shall not hesitate to say, I doubt\r\nwhether you would have had a man from the northern army, if the whole\r\ncould have been kept at Albany with any decency. Perhaps you will think\r\nme blamable in not having exercised the powers you gave me, and given a\r\npositive order. Perhaps I have been so: but, deliberately weighing all\r\ncircumstances, I did not, and do not, think it advisable to do it.\r\n\r\n                                    I have the honor to be,\r\n                                    With unfeigned esteem and regard,\r\n                                    Your Excellency’s most ob’t servant,\r\n                                    A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency General Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO GATES.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   Fishkill, November 12, 1777.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nEver since my arrival in this quarter, I have been endeavoring to\r\ncollect the best idea I could of the state of things in New-York, in\r\norder the better to form a judgment of the probable reinforcement gone\r\nto General Howe. On the whole, this is a fact well ascertained, that\r\nNew-York has been stripped as bare as possible: that in consequence of\r\nthis, the few troops there, and the inhabitants, are under so strong\r\napprehensions of an attack, as almost to amount to a _panic_; that to\r\nsupply the deficiency of men, every effort is making to excite the\r\ncitizens to arms for the defence of the city. For this purpose, the\r\npublic papers are full of addresses to them, that plainly speak the\r\napprehensions prevailing on the occasion.\r\n\r\nHence I infer, that a formidable force is gone to General Howe. The\r\ncalculations made by those who have had the best opportunities of\r\njudging, carry the number from six to seven thousand. If so, the number\r\ngone, and going, to General Washington, is far inferior; five thousand\r\nat the utmost. The militia were all detained by General Putnam till it\r\nbecame too late to send them.\r\n\r\nThe state of things I gave you when I had the pleasure of seeing you,\r\nwas, to the best of my knowledge, sacredly true. I give you the present\r\ninformation, that you may decide, whether any further succor can with\r\npropriety come from you.\r\n\r\nThe fleet, with the troops on board, sailed out of the Hook on the\r\nfifth instant. This circumstance demonstrates, beyond the possibility\r\nof doubt, that it is General Howe’s fixed intention to endeavor to hold\r\nPhiladelphia at all hazards; and removes all danger of any further\r\noperations up the North River this winter. Otherwise, Sir Henry\r\nClinton’s movement, at this advanced season, is altogether inexplicable.\r\n\r\nIf you can with propriety afford any further assistance, the most\r\nexpeditious manner of conveying it will be to acquaint General Putnam\r\nof it, that he may send on the troops with him, to be replaced by\r\nthem. You, Sir, best know the uses to which the troops with you are\r\nto be applied, and will determine accordingly. I am certain it is not\r\nHis Excellency’s wish to frustrate any plan you may have in view for\r\nthe benefit of the service, so far as it can possibly be avoided,\r\nconsistent with a due attention to more important objects.\r\n\r\n                                       I am, with respect, Sir,\r\n                                       Your most obedient servant,\r\n                                       Alex. Hamilton, A. D. C.\r\n\r\nTo General Gates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                      Peekskill, Nov. 15, 1777.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nI arrived at this place last night, and unfortunately find myself\r\nunable to proceed any further. Imagining I had gotten the better of my\r\ncomplaint, which confined me at Governor Clinton’s, and anxious to be\r\nabout attending to the march of the troops, the day before yesterday I\r\ncrossed the ferry, in order to fall in with General Glover’s brigade,\r\nwhich was on its march from Poughkeepsie to Fishkill. I did not,\r\nhowever, see it myself, but received a letter from Colonel Shepherd,\r\nwho commands the frigate, informing me he would be last night at\r\nFishkill, and this night at King’s ferry. Wagons, &c., are provided\r\non the other side for his accommodation; so that there need be no\r\ndelay but what is voluntary; and I believe Colonel Shepherd is as\r\nwell disposed as could be wished to hasten his march. General Poor’s\r\nbrigade crossed the ferry the day before yesterday. Two York regiments,\r\nCourtland’s and Livingston’s, are with them: they were unwilling to be\r\nseparated from the brigade, and the brigade from them. General Putnam\r\nwas unwilling to keep them with him: and if he had consented to do it,\r\nthe regiments to displace them would not join you six days as soon as\r\nthese. The troops now remaining with General Putnam will amount to\r\nabout the number you intended, though they are not exactly the same.\r\nHe has detached Colonel Charles Webb’s regiment to you. He _says_ the\r\ntroops with him are not in a condition to march, being destitute of\r\nshoes, stockings, and other necessaries: but I believe the true reasons\r\nof his being unwilling to pursue the mode pointed out by you, were his\r\naversion to the York troops, and his desire to retain General Parsons\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\n                                     I am, with much respect and esteem,\r\n                                     Your Excellency’s most ob’t serv’t,\r\n                                     A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nTo General Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Head-Quarters, November 15, 1777.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nI have duly received your several favors, from the time you left me to\r\nthat of the twelfth instant. I approve entirely of all the steps you\r\nhave taken; and have only to wish, that the exertions of those you have\r\nhad to deal with, had kept pace with your zeal and good intentions. I\r\nhope your health will, before this, have permitted you to push on the\r\nrear of the whole reinforcement beyond New Windsor. Some of the enemy’s\r\nships have arrived in the Delaware; but how many have troops on board,\r\nI cannot exactly ascertain. The enemy have lately damaged Fort Miflin\r\nconsiderably: but our people keep possession, and seem determined to do\r\nso to the last extremity. Our loss in men has been but small. Captain\r\nTreat is unfortunately among the killed. I wish you a safe return,\r\n\r\n                                             And am, dear Sir,\r\n                                             Your most obedient servant,\r\n                                             G. Washington.\r\n\r\nLt. Col. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHUGH KNOX TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  St. Croix, December 10, 1777.\r\n\r\nDear Hamilton:\r\n\r\nThe fine, impartial, laconic, and highly descriptive account you\r\nfavored me with of the last year’s campaign, in your letter of March\r\nlast, excited in me, and many of your other friends here, an earnest\r\ndesire of further accounts from your pen, of the succeeding fortunes\r\nof the Great American War: a war which will, one day, shine more\r\nillustriously in the historic page, than any which has happened since\r\nthe times of Nimrod and the Giants; and deservedly, on account of\r\nthe goodness of the cause, the grandeur of the object, the eclat of\r\nthe Generals, the bravery of the troops--and (alas! that I should be\r\nobliged to add) of the cruelty and ferocity which has marked the route\r\nof your enemies; and the tons of brothers’ blood which have been shed\r\non the unhappy occasion!\r\n\r\nI wrote two answers to your obliging letter, both of which I hope have\r\nreached you; and in both of which I have urged it upon you, to make and\r\ncollect such memoirs as the urgency of your affairs will permit you;\r\nwhich may furnish materials for an accurate history of the war, when\r\nyou shall have leisure to fill up and embellish such a skeleton, with\r\nall that elegance and dignity of which your fine pen is capable.\r\n\r\nThe honorable post you hold under the GREAT General Washington, and so\r\nnear his person, will give you a peculiar advantage for delineating\r\nhis character, both in his amiable private virtues, and military\r\nabilities. And depend upon it, the very minutiæ of that incomparable\r\nman will be read with avidity by posterity. You know me too well, I\r\nhope, to suspect me of superstition; yet I feel myself, at times,\r\nunder a strong impulse to _prophesy_, that _Washington_ was born for\r\nthe deliverance of America--that that Providence who has raised and\r\ntrained him up for that very purpose, will watch over his _sacred_ life\r\nwith a paternal and solicitous care; will shield his head in every\r\nday of battle--_will_ give him to see America _free_, _flourishing_,\r\nand _happy_--and _will_ adorn his fame, among latest posterity, with\r\na Garland of Laurel, more verdant, blooming, and enviable, than ever\r\nadorned the brow of a _Marlborough_!\r\n\r\nThe bearer of this line (if he should be indeed so fortunate as to put\r\nit into your hand) is our worthy friend, Mr. Cornelius Durant, who is\r\npossessed of an ardent desire of having the honor of a short interview\r\nwith General Washington; principally, that he may have it to say, that\r\nhe has seen and spoken to _the greatest man of this Age_: and, indeed,\r\nconsidering Mr. Durant’s personal worth; his uncommon zeal for, and\r\nattachment to, the American cause; the losses he has sustained in\r\nattempting to assist her; and his extraordinary admiration of, and love\r\nto, the General’s character and person; few men more richly merit this\r\nindulgence. If you still exist, and exist near the General’s person\r\n(and I have not yet seen your name among the lists of the slain or the\r\ndisgraced), you can easily procure him this honor--and I trust you will.\r\n\r\nWe are now blessed with, and certified of, the glorious news of\r\nBurgoyne’s surrender to the immortal Gates; another bright\r\nstar in the Constellation of American Heroes: and we are momently\r\nexpecting to hear, that General Washington has done something like\r\nthe same by General Howe! But we yet tremble in suspense--and it is\r\nindeed a _painful one_. Probably before this letter goes, we shall hear\r\nmore of the matter. Our general accounts are favorable: and while the\r\n_Chevaux de frize_ are defended, we have no fears about Philadelphia.\r\nMay this campaign decide the matter!\r\n\r\nBy the time this reaches you, you will be (if you are at all) in winter\r\nquarters; and perhaps may be at leisure to write me a half folio, of\r\nwhich Mr. Durant will take care to write me duplicates or triplicates,\r\nfor fear of miscarriage.\r\n\r\nA piece of mine, entitled “An Address to America, by a friend in a\r\nforeign government,” has been sent to the Congress for publication\r\n(if approved). I know not yet its fate. It is, at least, an honestly\r\ndesigned and animating piece, but written incorrectly, and in a hurry.\r\nIf you have seen it, pray give me your sentiments about it; but let it\r\nbe on a loose paper inclosed in your letter; for the knowledge of my\r\nbeing the author must be a profound secret here.\r\n\r\nMy wishes are, that the God of Armies may defend and protect you,\r\nand cause you happily to survive, and to hand down to posterity the\r\npresent important scenes. Numbers here esteem you, and would join me in\r\ndeclaring themselves, as I do,\r\n\r\n                              Dear Hamilton,\r\n                              Your ever affectionate friend and servant,\r\n                              Hugh Knox.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLINTON TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Poughkeepsie, 28th December, 1777.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nI was favored with the receipt of your letter of the 22d instant,\r\nsome days since, and returned a short answer to it by the express who\r\nbrought it; but as I have reason to believe you had left Peekskill\r\nbefore he got there, I conclude my letter has not been received. I\r\nhave not a doubt but that there have been such unjust and dishonorable\r\npractices committed on the inhabitants as you mention; nor have I\r\nreason to believe they were without the knowledge of the commanding\r\nofficer of the Department. Complaints have been exhibited to him of\r\ncattle, the property of the inhabitants of this State, living near\r\nCol. Robinson’s, being drove off by parties of the continental troops,\r\nand sold at vendue in New England, without any account being rendered\r\nto the proprietors; and, if I am rightly informed, an officer with\r\na party, took sundry articles from Robinson’s, sent them off and\r\nsold them in like manner in Connecticut, and has not accounted with\r\nthe States for the proceeds. Of this I informed General Putnam, and\r\ndesired that an inquiry might be made into the conduct of the officer\r\ncommanding the party, to which I was more particularly induced, as\r\nI found he had given an order on the Quarter-Master General for the\r\npayment of the teams employed in carrying off those effects; but I have\r\nreason to believe he has had no regard to my request. Of this I am\r\nfully convinced, that the soldiery claim as lawful prize every thing\r\nthey take within the enemy’s lines, though the property of our best\r\nfriends, and whatever is taken beyond our advanced posts, by a generous\r\nconstruction, comes within the above predicament. On this principle\r\nthe several articles taken at and near Robinson’s were sold because\r\nthe enemy’s shipping were then in the river near that place; and on\r\nthe same principle indiscriminate plunder might have taken place on\r\nboth sides of the river as high up as the manor of Livingston. Little\r\ngood can be expected of an army whose interest it is to suffer a\r\ncountry to be abandoned to the enemy, thereby to justify plundering the\r\ninhabitants. Perhaps, and I don’t know that it would be uncharitable to\r\nsuppose, that it is this trade that makes some people so very fond of\r\nlittle expeditions.\r\n\r\nI have long thought to ascertain these facts, and seek redress not only\r\nfor the parties immediately injured, but the public; but my time has\r\nbeen so fully employed of late about other matters that I have been\r\nobliged to neglect it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMay I expect a line from you whenever you have leisure; be assured\r\nit will always be most kindly received, though perhaps not quite so\r\npunctually answered by\r\n\r\n                                             Your most obedient servant,\r\n                                             Geo. Clinton.\r\n\r\nMy respects to Capt. Gibbs and young Livingston.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO WILLIAM DUER, M. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                           Head-Quarters, 1778.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nI take the liberty to trouble you with a few hints on a matter of\r\nsome importance. Baron Steuben, who will be the bearer of this, waits\r\non Congress to have his office[2] arranged upon some decisive and\r\npermanent footing. It will not be amiss to be on your guard. The Baron\r\nis a gentleman for whom I have a particular esteem; and whose zeal,\r\nintelligence, and success, the consequence of both, entitle him to the\r\ngreatest credit. But I am apprehensive, with all his good qualities, a\r\nfondness for power and importance, natural to every man, may lead him\r\nto wish for more extensive prerogatives in his department than it will\r\nbe for the good of the service to grant. I should be sorry to excite\r\nany prejudice against him on this account: perhaps I may be mistaken\r\nin my conjecture. The caution I give will do no harm if I am: if I\r\nam not, it maybe useful. In either case, the Baron deserves to be\r\nconsidered as a valuable man, and treated with all the deference which\r\ngood policy will warrant.\r\n\r\nOn the first institution of this office, the General allowed him to\r\nexercise more ample powers than would be proper for a continuance. They\r\nwere necessary in the commencement, to put things in a train with a\r\ndegree of dispatch which the exigency of our affairs required: but it\r\nhas been necessary to restrain them, even earlier than was intended.\r\nThe novelty of the office excited questions about its boundaries; the\r\nextent of its operations alarmed the officers of every rank for their\r\nown rights. Their jealousies and discontents were rising fast to a\r\nheight that threatened to overturn the whole plan. It became necessary\r\nto apply a remedy. The General has delineated the functions of the\r\nInspectorship in general orders, a copy of which will be sent to\r\nCongress. The plan is good, and satisfactory to the army in general.\r\n\r\nIt may be improved, but it will be unsafe to deviate essentially from\r\nit. It is of course the General’s intention, that whatever regulations\r\nare adopted by him, should undergo the revision, and receive the\r\nsanction, of Congress: but it is indispensable, in the present state\r\nof our army, that he should have the power, from time to time, to\r\nintroduce and authorize the reformations necessary in our system. It is\r\na work which must be done by occasional and gradual steps; and ought\r\nto be intrusted to a person on the spot, who is thoroughly acquainted\r\nwith all our defects, and has judgment sufficient to adopt the\r\nprogressive remedies they require. The plan established by Congress, on\r\na report of the Board of War when Conway was appointed, appears to me\r\nexceptionable in many respects. It makes the Inspector independent of\r\nthe Commander-in-chief; confers powers which would produce universal\r\nopposition in the army; and, by making the previous concurrence of\r\nthe Board of War requisite to the introduction of every regulation\r\nwhich should be found necessary, opens such a continual source of\r\ndelay as would defeat the usefulness of the institution. Let the\r\nCommander-in-chief introduce, and the legislature afterwards ratify,\r\nor reject, as they shall think proper. Perhaps you will not differ much\r\nfrom me, when I suppose, that so far as relates to the Board of War,\r\nthe former scheme was a _brat of faction_, and therefore ought to be\r\nrenounced.\r\n\r\nThere is one thing which the Baron has much at heart, which, in good\r\npolicy, he can by no means be indulged in: it is the power of enforcing\r\nthat part of discipline which we understand by subordination, or an\r\nobedience to orders. This power can only be properly lodged with the\r\nCommander-in-chief, and would inflame the whole army if put into other\r\nhands. Each Captain is vested with it in his company; each Colonel\r\nin his regiment: each General in his particular command: and the\r\nCommander-in-chief in the whole.\r\n\r\nWhen I began this letter, I did not intend to meddle with any other\r\nsubject than the Inspectorship; but one just comes into my head which\r\nappears to me of no small importance. The goodness, or force, of an\r\narmy, depends as much, perhaps more, on the composition of the corps\r\nwhich form it, as on its collective number. The composition is good or\r\nbad, not only according to the quality of the men, but in proportion to\r\nthe completeness or incompleteness of a corps in respect to numbers. A\r\nregiment, for instance, with a full complement of officers, and fifty\r\nor sixty men, is not half so good as a company with the same number of\r\nmen. A Colonel will look upon such a command as unworthy his ambition,\r\nand will neglect and despise it: a Captain would pride himself in it,\r\nand take all the pains in his power to bring it to perfection. In one\r\ncase we shall see a total relaxation of discipline, and negligence\r\nof every thing that constitutes military excellence: in the other,\r\nthere will be attention, energy, and every thing that can be wished.\r\nOpinion, whether well or ill-founded, is the governing principle of\r\nhuman affairs. A corps much below its establishment, comparing what it\r\nis with what it ought to be, loses all confidence in itself; and the\r\nwhole army loses that confidence and emulation which are essential to\r\nsuccess. These, and a thousand other things that will occur to you,\r\nmake it evident, that the most important advantages attend the having\r\ncomplete corps, and proportional disadvantages the reverse. Ten\r\nthousand men, distributed into twenty imperfect regiments, will not\r\nhave the efficiency of the same number in half the number of regiments.\r\nThe fact is, with respect to the American army, that the want of\r\ndiscipline, and other defects we labor under, are as much owing to the\r\nskeleton state of our regiments as to any other cause. What then?\r\n\r\nHave we any prospect of filling our regiments? My opinion is, that we\r\nhave nearly arrived to our _ne plus ultra_. If so, we ought to reduce\r\nthe number of corps, and give them that substance and consistency\r\nwhich they want, by incorporating them together, so as to bring them\r\nnear their establishment. By this measure the army would be infinitely\r\nimproved; and the State would be saved the expense of maintaining a\r\nnumber of superfluous officers.\r\n\r\nIn the present condition of our regiments, they are incapable even of\r\nperforming their common exercises without joining two or more together:\r\nan expedient reluctantly submitted to by those officers who see\r\nthemselves made second in command of a battalion, instead of first, as\r\ntheir commission imports; which happens to every younger Colonel whose\r\nregiment is united with that of an elder.\r\n\r\nWhat would be the inconveniencies, while the officers who remain in\r\ncommand, and who might be selected from the others on account of\r\nsuperior merit, would applaud themselves in the preference given them,\r\nand rejoice at a change which confers such additional consequence on\r\nthemselves?\r\n\r\nThose who should be excluded by the measure, would return home\r\ndiscontented, and make a noise, which would soon subside and be\r\nforgotten among matters of greater moment. To quiet them still more\r\neffectually, if it should be thought necessary, they might be put upon\r\nhalf-pay for a certain time.\r\n\r\nIf, on considering this matter, you should agree with me in sentiment,\r\nit were to be wished the scheme could be immediately adopted, while the\r\narrangement now in hand is still unexecuted. If it is made, it will be\r\nrather inconvenient, immediately after, to unhinge and throw the whole\r\nsystem again afloat. When you determined on your last arrangement,\r\nyou did not know what success the different States might have had in\r\ndraughting and recruiting. It would then have been improper to reduce\r\nthe number of corps, as proposed. We have now seen their success: we\r\nhave no prospect of seeing the regiments filled; we should reduce them.\r\n\r\n                                        Believe me to be,\r\n                                        With great esteem and regard,\r\n                                        Dear Sir, your obedient servant,\r\n                                        A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n[2] Inspector-General of the Army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO GEN. SULLIVAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                           Head-Quarters, 1778.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nHis Excellency has received your two last favors to-day. In the first\r\nyou hint the want of a reinforcement, but as the intention of your body\r\nis chiefly for observation and skirmishing, and not to make any serious\r\nstands, it is the less necessary it should be powerful in numbers. It\r\nwill, however, depend upon circumstances how far it will be expedient\r\nto reinforce you; and as soon as any thing can be determined from them,\r\nyou shall have whatever addition of strength you may stand in need of.\r\n\r\nThe information contained in your last, of the enemy’s being encamped\r\non the road leading from New Brunswick to Princeton, about the Third\r\nMile Run, is not well founded. We have had parties and officers\r\nreconnoitring as far as the Mile Run, and there is no sign of an\r\nencampment. They seem to be taking their old position with their right\r\nat Amboy, their left at Brunswick; but how long they will remain\r\nso it is hard to tell. His Excellency desires you will engage some\r\ntrusty person at South Amboy, on whom you can depend for faithful and\r\nearly intelligence of the appearance of shipping in the river, or any\r\npreparations for a movement by water, that we may be in time prepared\r\nto counteract them.\r\n\r\n                                             I am, with regard, Sir,\r\n                                             Your most obedient servant,\r\n                                             A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAY TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                         Albany, 8th May, 1778.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nAn opinion of your benevolence leads me to address this letter to\r\nyou. Accident has introduced me to Monsieur Lewis de Caleron. We\r\nhappen to lodge in the same house. His modesty and decent manners made\r\nan impression upon me, and induced me to make some inquiries into\r\nhis history and character. The gentlemen of this place say handsome\r\nthings of him. He is the son of a Major General who fell last war\r\nat Ticonderoga. The family is still in Canada, and one of the most\r\nrespectable in that country. He was sent to France when five years old,\r\nand there educated. He came out with some French troops to Martinico,\r\nand by their General, as well as Mr. Bingham, was recommended to\r\nCongress. They gave him a brevet for a Captain’s commission. He served\r\nlast campaign as a volunteer, first with General Furmoy, and afterwards\r\nwith Colonel Morgan. To me he appears to have been neglected. It seems\r\nhe did not descend to the adulation lately fashionable, and perhaps\r\nacceptable, in his department. While effrontery and arrogance, even\r\nin our virtuous and enlightened days, are giving rank and importance\r\nto men whom wisdom would have left in obscurity, I am persuaded you\r\nwill be happy in an opportunity of exploring, as well as cherishing,\r\nmodest merit. I think M. De Caleron is not without it, and under this\r\nimpression I recommend him to your notice as a probationer.\r\n\r\nTell me in some future letter whether he deserves the favorable opinion\r\nI am inclined to entertain of him.\r\n\r\n                                   I am, dear Sir,\r\n                                   Very sincerely, and with much esteem,\r\n                                   Your obedient servant,\r\n                                   John Jay.\r\n\r\nLt. Col. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Head-Quarters, 4th June, 1778.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nMr. Loring having been sent by Sir Henry Clinton to meet Mr. Boudinot,\r\nor any other person appointed by me for the purpose of effecting an\r\nexchange of prisoners. I have therefore to desire you (Mr. Boudinot\r\nbeing absent from camp) to hear any proposals Mr. Loring may have to\r\noffer on this subject; and to do definitively whatever may be necessary\r\ntowards the execution of a general exchange of prisoners. And I hereby\r\nassure you that your proceedings in this instance will be ratified by\r\nme.\r\n\r\n                                    I am, Sir, your very humble servant,\r\n                                    G. Washington.\r\n\r\nLieut. Col. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                        25th June, 1778.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nWe find, on our arrival here, that the intelligence received on the\r\nroad is true. The enemy have all filed off from Allen Town, on the\r\nMonmouth road. Their rear is said to be a mile westward of Lawrence\r\nTaylor’s tavern, six miles from Allen Town. General Maxwell is at\r\nHyde’s Town, about three miles from this place. General Dickinson is\r\nsaid to be on the enemy’s right flank; but where, cannot be told. We\r\ncan hear nothing certain of General Scott; but, from circumstances,\r\nhe is probably at Allen Town. We shall, agreeably to your request,\r\nconsider and appoint some proper place of rendezvous for the union of\r\nour force, which we shall communicate to Generals Maxwell and Scott,\r\nand to yourself. In the mean time, I would recommend to you to move\r\ntoward this place as soon as the convenience of your men will permit.\r\nI am told that Colonel Morgan is on the enemy’s right flank. We had a\r\nslight skirmish with their rear this forenoon, at Robert Montgomery’s,\r\non the Monmouth road, leading from Allen Town. We shall see General\r\nMaxwell immediately, and you will hear from us again. Send this to the\r\nGeneral after reading it.\r\n\r\n                                                I am your ob’t serv’t,\r\n                                                Alex. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n                Doctor Stile’s House, Cranbury Town, 9 o’clock.\r\n\r\nWe are just informed that General Scott passed by Hooper’s tavern, five\r\nmiles from Allen Town, this afternoon at five o’clock.\r\n\r\nM. De Lafayette.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      {Robin’s Tavern, 8 miles from Allen Town,\r\n                      {12 o’clock, June 26, 1778.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nWe have halted the troops at this place. The enemy, by our last\r\nreports, were four miles from this (that is, their rear), and had\r\npassed the road which turns off toward South Amboy, which determines\r\ntheir route toward Shrewsbury. Our reason for halting, is the extreme\r\ndistress of the troops for want of provisions. General Wayne’s\r\ndetachment is almost starving, and seems both unwilling and unable to\r\nmarch further till they are supplied. If we do not receive an immediate\r\nsupply, the whole purpose of our detachment must be frustrated.\r\n\r\nThis morning we missed doing any thing, from a deficiency of\r\nintelligence. On my arrival at Cranbury yester-evening, I proceeded,\r\nby desire of the Marquis, immediately to Hyde’s Town and Allen Town,\r\nto take measures for co-operating with the different parts of the\r\ndetachment, and to find what was doing to procure intelligence. I found\r\nevery precaution was neglected; no horse was near the enemy, nor could\r\nbe heard of till late in the morning: so that before we could send out\r\nparties and get the necessary information, they were in full march: and\r\nas they have marched pretty expeditiously, we should not be able to\r\ncome up with them during the march of the day, if we did not suffer the\r\nimpediment we do, on the score of provisions. We are entirely at a loss\r\nwhere the army is, which is no inconsiderable check to our enterprise.\r\nIf the army is wholly out of supporting distance, we risk the total\r\nloss of the detachment in making an attack.\r\n\r\nIf the army will countenance us, we may do something clever. We feel\r\nour personal honor, as well as the honor of the army, and the good of\r\nthe service, interested; and are heartily desirous to attempt whatever\r\nthe disposition of our men will second, and prudence authorize. It is\r\nevident the enemy wish to avoid, not to engage us.\r\n\r\nDesertions, I imagine, have been pretty considerable to-day. I have\r\nseen eight or ten deserters, and have heard of many more. We have\r\nhad some little skirmishing by detached parties: one attacked their\r\nrear-guard with a degree of success, killed a few, and took seven\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\nAn officer is just come in, who informs that he left the enemy’s rear\r\nfive miles off, still in march, about half an hour ago. To ascertain\r\nstill more fully their route, I have ordered a fresh party on their\r\nleft, toward the head of their column. They have three brigades in rear\r\nof their baggage.\r\n\r\n                               I am, with great respect and regard, Sir,\r\n                               Your obedient servant,\r\n                               A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency General Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          June 28, 1778.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nThe result of what I have seen and heard, concerning the enemy, is,\r\nthat they have encamped with their van a little beyond Monmouth\r\nCourt House, and their rear at Manalapan’s river, about seven\r\nmiles from this place. Their march to-day has been very judiciously\r\nconducted;--their baggage in front, and their flying army in the rear,\r\nwith a rear-guard of one thousand men about four hundred paces from the\r\nmain body. To attack them in this situation, without being supported by\r\nthe whole army, would be folly in the extreme. If it should be thought\r\nadvisable to give the necessary support, the army can move to some\r\nposition near the enemy’s left flank, which would put them in a very\r\nawkward situation, with so respectable a body in their rear; and it\r\nwould put it out of their power to turn either flank, should they be\r\nso disposed. Their left is strongly posted, and I am told their right\r\nalso. By some accounts, one part of their army lies on the road leading\r\nfrom the Monmouth road to South Amboy. It is not improbable that South\r\nAmboy may be the object.\r\n\r\nI had written thus far when your letter to the Marquis arrived. This\r\nputs the matter on a totally different footing. The detachment will\r\nmarch to-morrow morning at three o’clock to English Town.\r\n\r\n                                     I am, with great regard and esteem,\r\n                                     Your obedient servant,\r\n                                     A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency Gen. Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    Black Point, July 20, 1778.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nInclosed I transmit your Excellency a letter from Count D’Estaing. He\r\nhas had the river sounded, and finds he cannot enter. He will sail\r\nfor Rhode Island to-morrow evening. In the mean time, he is making\r\ndemonstrations to deceive the enemy, and beget an opinion that he\r\nintends to operate in this quarter. He would sail immediately, but he\r\nawaits the arrival, or to hear, of a frigate which carried Mr. Gerard\r\nto Delaware, and which he appointed to meet him at Sandy Hook; so\r\nthat he fears his sudden and unexpected departure, before she arrives,\r\nmight cause her to be lost. He will not, however, wait longer than till\r\nto-morrow evening. We have agreed, that five cannon, fired briskly,\r\nshall be a signal of his arrival by day, and the same number, with\r\nfive sky-rockets, a signal by night. In communicating this to General\r\nSullivan, the Count wishes not a moment may be lost; and that he may\r\nbe directed to have persons stationed on the coast, and intermediate\r\nexpresses, to facilitate the communication between them. Pilots will\r\nbe a material article. He begs every thing may be forwarded as much as\r\npossible; and as many troops collected as may be. He would be glad if a\r\ndetachment could march from your army, or could be sent by water; for\r\nwhich purpose he would send covering ships, and some vessels he has\r\ntaken, by way of transports; but he cannot think of losing so much time\r\nas seems necessary. If the water scheme could shorten it, it would be\r\na happy circumstance. He recommends it to your attention; and that you\r\nwould take measures, if the end can be better answered in this way, and\r\nmeet him with information of the part he may have to act to execute the\r\nplan. I perceive he can, with difficulty, debark four thousand troops;\r\nbut he will try to do it.\r\n\r\nI hope your Excellency will excuse my not being myself the bearer of\r\nthese particulars; the end may be answered by letter. Mr. Neville is\r\nanxious to get on. I just have heard of dispatches arrived from you. I\r\ndon’t know but they may contain something new which may make the Count\r\nto wish a good conveyance to return an answer. My stay till to-morrow\r\nmorning may answer that end. I shall not delay coming forward.\r\n\r\n                                         I am, Sir, your most respectful\r\n                                         And obedient servant,\r\n                                         Alex. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency General Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Newark, July 23, 1778, one o’clock.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nI wrote to your Excellency the evening of the 20th, by Major Neville.\r\nI remained in the neighborhood of Black Point till the afternoon\r\nfollowing. The Count had received his expected dispatches from\r\nCongress, and was to sail, as I mentioned before, the first fair wind.\r\nAt Brunswick, yesterday, Mr. Caldwell joined me. He was immediately\r\nfrom the Point, and brought intelligence that the fleet got under way\r\nyesterday morning. The wind, unfortunately, has been much against them;\r\nwhich is so much the more to be regretted, as they are rather in want\r\nof water.\r\n\r\nI need not suggest to your Excellency, that an essential part of the\r\nRhode Island plan, is to take every possible measure to watch the\r\nenemy’s motions, and to establish expresses from place to place, to\r\ngive the Count instant information of any movement among their fleet.\r\nThis will enable him to be in time to intercept them, should they\r\nattempt to evacuate New-York, while he is at Rhode Island; and will, in\r\ngeneral, facilitate the intercourse and co-operation between him and\r\nyour Excellency.\r\n\r\nI have nothing new to communicate, beside what was sent by Major\r\nNeville, and what I now send. All the ideas interchanged between\r\nthe Count and myself, were such as were familiar before I left Head\r\nQuarters. He was to go to Rhode Island, and, in conjunction with\r\nGeneral Sullivan, endeavor to possess himself of the enemy’s ships and\r\ntroops there; if, on his arrival, he had good reason to think it could\r\nbe effected without further assistance. If not, he will be glad of a\r\nreinforcement from you in the most expeditious manner possible. What\r\nmanner you think will be most expeditious, you will adopt; and if his\r\naid may be useful, he will afford it as soon as he is informed of it.\r\n\r\nThis being the case, my immediate presence at Head Quarters is the less\r\nnecessary as to this business; and I hope your Excellency will indulge\r\nme, if I do not make all the dispatch back which a case of emergency\r\nwould require; though I do not mean to delay, more than a moderate\r\nattention to my frail constitution may make not improper. I have, &c.,\r\n\r\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency Gen. Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOL. LAURENS TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Dear Hamilton:\r\n\r\nYou have seen, and by this time considered, General Lee’s infamous\r\npublication. I have collected some hints for an answer; but I do not\r\nthink, either that I can rely upon my own knowledge of facts and\r\nstyle to answer him fully, or that it would be prudent to undertake\r\nit without counsel. An affair of this kind ought to be passed over in\r\ntotal silence, or answered in a masterly manner.\r\n\r\nThe ancient secretary is the Recueil of modern history and anecdotes,\r\nand will give them to us with candor, elegance, and perspicuity.\r\nThe pen of Junius is in your hand; and I think you will, without\r\ndifficulty, expose, in his defence, letters, and last production, such\r\na tissue of falsehood and inconsistency, as will satisfy the world, and\r\nput him for ever to silence.\r\n\r\nI think the affair will be definitively decided in Congress this day.\r\nHe has found means to league himself with the _old faction_, and to\r\ngain a great many partisans.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my dear boy. I shall set out for camp to-morrow.\r\n\r\n                                                  John Laurens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAFAYETTE TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               A Yorctown, 1er Septembre, 1778.\r\n\r\nNe suis-je pas bien malheureux, cher Colonel. On me pousse pour aller à\r\nBoston, on me chasse de Rhode Island, ils n’ont ni repos, ni patience\r\nque je ne sois parti, et le même jour que je m’absente est le seul où\r\nj’aurais dû, où j’avais voulu être dans l’île. Le diable en veut dans\r\nce moment à tous les français; heureusement que je viens de l’attraper,\r\ncar à force de courir je suis arrivé à temps pour l’évacuation dont\r\nil voulait encore me priver. Le malheur de ne pas être à la première\r\naffaire m’a fait la peine la plus vive, et je ne m’en consolerai\r\njamais, quoique ce soit bien loin d’être ma faute. Les deux retraites\r\nfont honneur aux troupes et au général Sullivan, qui s’y est conduit\r\nparfaitement, elles en font rue aux Anglais et à leur généraux qui\r\nn’ont montré ni activité, ni génie, du moins à ce qu’il me paraît.\r\n\r\nLe malheureux Mr. Tousard a eu le bras emporté au milieu d’une des\r\nactions les plus valeureuses qui ait été faite. C’est un homme aussi\r\nbrave qu’il est honnête. Je crains d’embarrasser le général en lui\r\nmandant ce que je voudrais qu’on fît pour lui; mais la commission de\r\nMajor ne pouvait-elle pas se changer en celle de lieutenant Colonel;\r\nil avait fait un arrangement avant de partir _le grand arrangement de\r\nMr. du Coudray_, où en cas de la perte d’un membre, ils devaient avoir\r\nune pension de tant, cet arrangement-là qui comme vous savez n’a pas été\r\naccepté, ne pouvait-il pas se renouveler en sa faveur.\r\n\r\nIl faut que vous me rendiez un grand service; c’est de me mander le\r\nplus de détails possibles sur la flotte de Lord Howe,--les moyens qui\r\nexistent à New-York, etc. etc. Mr. D’Estaing a beaucoup de raisons de\r\ncroire qu’il est arrivé quelques vaisseaux d’Angleterre, autres le\r\nCornwall. Mandez-moi dans une longue lettre, Mon Cher Hamilton, ce\r\nque vous pensez sur ce qui a été fait, ce qui va se faire, et ce qui\r\npouvait être fait dans la suite. Votre dépêche me trouvera à Warren,\r\npetite ville près de la Providence, où je vais m’occuper à garder\r\nbeaucoup de pays avec peu de troupes, et où sans répondre d’empêcher\r\nune descente des ennemis, je ferai le moins mal possible; si forces\r\négales, je tâcherai de les battre. On me flatte que le Général viendra\r\nici lui-même; Dieu le veuille. Les affaires sur lesquelles je vous ai\r\nécrit mes complaintes, l’appaisent un peu, mais pour prendre Rhode\r\nIsland il nous faut le Général Washington.\r\n\r\nJ’attends de vos nouvelles par Mons de Pontgibault et finirai\r\nsimplement ma lettre en vous assurant de mon tendre attachement.\r\n\r\n                                                     Lafayette.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO ----.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   Head Quarters, Nov. 8, 1778.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nI have received your favor of the 4th, and shall with pleasure\r\ncommunicate the intelligence we have had at Head Quarters. On the\r\nmorning of the third one hundred and eight sail of vessels sailed out\r\nof the Hook,--supposed, from the best calculations, to contain seven or\r\neight thousand men. They first steered to the eastward, but soon after\r\nchanged their course and bore S. E. with the wind at N. W. The general\r\naccounts from New-York speak of three distinct embarkations--one for\r\nthe West Indies--another for Halifax--another for St. Augustine. One\r\ndivision, which seems to be best ascertained, contains ten or twelve\r\nBritish regiments, and most of the new levies, which probably went in\r\nthe above-mentioned fleet.\r\n\r\nThis much is pretty certain, that the embarkation has continued since\r\nthe departure of that fleet, which is a strong circumstance in favor\r\nof a general evacuation. All their vessels the least out of repair\r\nare drawn up to the different ship-yards, and their repairs are going\r\non with all possible vigor. Whether the merchants are packing up or\r\nnot, is a point still much _in dubio_; though we have several accounts\r\nthat look like it, but they are not so precise and certain as could\r\nbe wished. Several bales of goods have been seen on the wharves,\r\nmarked for particular ships. A deserter, indeed, lately from the city,\r\ninsists that he saw Coffin and Anderson packing up. This, if true,\r\nwould be decisive, for this is a very considerable house particularly\r\nattached to the army. One of our spies, a trusty one too, writes the\r\n31st of October that the principal part of the sick from the hospitals\r\nhad embarked; but this stands almost wholly upon its own bottom. The\r\ncapture of Jamaica seems to be a mere rumor. There are several others,\r\nrespecting St. Kitts, Monserat, and Grenada. The two former are\r\nsaid to have been taken by surprise on a temporary absence of their\r\nguard-ships, but these stories were not improbably suggested by a late\r\nsudden and very considerable rise in the prices of rum and molasses.\r\nThe former being as high as fourteen or fifteen shillings per gallon.\r\nLarge purchases have been made of these articles as sea stores for the\r\ntroops, and the speculators in the city have been bidding against the\r\nCommissaries, which better accounts for the increased prices.\r\n\r\nIt is a question very undecided in my mind whether the enemy\r\nwill evacuate or not. Reasoning _a priori_, the arguments seem\r\nto be strongest for it--from the exhausted state of the British\r\nresources--the naked condition of their dominions every where--and the\r\npossibility of a Spanish war. But on the other hand naval superiority\r\nmust do a great deal in the business. This, I think, considering all\r\nthings, appears clearly enough to be on the side of Britain. The\r\nsluggishness of Spain affords room to doubt her taking a decisive\r\npart. The preserving posts in these States will greatly distress our\r\ntrade, and give security to the British West India trade. They will\r\nalso cover the West Indies, and restrain any operations of ours against\r\nthe British dominions on the continent. These considerations, and\r\nthe depreciated state of our currency, will be strong inducements to\r\nkeep New-York and Rhode Island, if not with a view to conquest, with\r\na view to temporary advantages, and making better terms in a future\r\nnegotiation.\r\n\r\nFrom appearances, the great delay which attends the embarkation, the\r\nabsolute tranquillity of the post at Rhode Island, where there is no\r\nkind of preparation for leaving it, and some other circumstances,\r\nseem to indicate an intention to remain. On the other hand, besides\r\nthe general appearances I have already mentioned, their inattention\r\nto the petition of the refugees, and the not raising new works, are\r\nstrong additional reasons for going away. I think it most probable,\r\nif they were determined to continue a garrison, that they would give\r\nmost explicit assurances to their friends, in order to encourage their\r\nproposal, and engage them to aid in maintaining it. I think also they\r\nwould contract their works, to be better proportioned to the number of\r\nthe garrison, and of course more defensible, by throwing a chain of\r\nfortifications across the narrow part of the island.\r\n\r\nNothing has yet been decided, that we know of, with respect to the\r\nsentences you mention. General Lee’s case, by our last advices, was on\r\nthe eve of a final decision. It seems he has made a strong party in\r\nCongress, and is very confident of having the sentence annulled. St.\r\nClair’s trial was ordered to be printed for the separate consideration\r\nof the members.\r\n\r\nThe depreciation of our currency really casts a gloom on our prospects,\r\nbut my sentiments on this subject are rather peculiar. I think, bad\r\nas it is, it will continue to draw out the resources of the country a\r\ngood while longer, and especially if the enemy make such detachments,\r\nof which there is hardly a doubt, as will oblige them to act on the\r\ndefensive. This will make our public expenditures infinitely less--and\r\nwill allow the States leisure to attend to the arrangements of their\r\nfinances, as well as the country tranquillity to cultivate its\r\nresources.\r\n\r\nAny letters that may come to Head Quarters for you will be carefully\r\nforwarded.\r\n\r\n                              I am, with the most respectful attachment,\r\n                              Dear Sir, your obed’t servant,\r\n                              A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO BARON STEUBEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Head Quarters, 19th Dec., 1778.\r\n\r\nI snatch a hasty moment, my dear Baron, to acknowledge the receipt of\r\nyour obliging favor of the sixth. It came here while I was absent in an\r\ninterview with some British Commissioners on the subject of an exchange\r\nof prisoners, and was not delivered to me till two days ago. I am sorry\r\nthat your business does not seem to make so speedy a progress as we\r\nall wish; but I hope it will soon come to a satisfactory termination.\r\nI wish you to be in a situation to employ yourself usefully and\r\nagreeably, and to contribute to giving our military constitution that\r\norder and perfection it certainly wants. I have not time now to enter\r\nupon some matters which I shall take another opportunity to give you my\r\nsentiments concerning. I have read your letter to Lee with pleasure.\r\nIt was conceived in terms which the offence merited; and if he had had\r\nany feeling, must have been felt by him. Considering the pointedness\r\nand severity of your expressions, his answer was certainly a very\r\nmodest one, and proved that he had not a violent appetite for so close\r\na _tête-à-tête_ as you seem disposed to insist upon. This evasion, if\r\nknown to the world, would do him very little honor. I don’t know but\r\nI shall be shortly at Philadelphia: if so, I shall have the honor of\r\npersonally assuring you of the perfect respect and esteem with which I\r\nam,\r\n\r\n                                               My dear Baron,\r\n                                               Your most obed’t servant,\r\n                                               Alex. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNARRATIVE OF AN AFFAIR OF HONOR BETWEEN GENERAL LEE AND COL. LAURENS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    24th December, 1778.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lee, attended by Major Edwards and Col. Laurens attended by\r\nCol. Hamilton, met agreeable to appointment on Wednesday afternoon\r\nhalf past three, in a wood, situate near the four mile stone on the\r\nPoint-no-Point Road. Pistols having been the weapons previously fixed\r\nupon, and the combatants being provided with a brace each, it was asked\r\nin what manner they were to proceed. General Lee proposed to advance\r\nupon one another, and each fire at what time and distance he thought\r\nproper. Col. Laurens expressed his preference of this mode, and agreed\r\nto the proposal accordingly.\r\n\r\nThey approached each other within about five or six paces, and\r\nexchanged a shot almost at the same moment. As Col. Laurens was\r\npreparing for a second discharge, General Lee declared himself wounded.\r\nCol. Laurens, as if apprehending the wound to be more serious than it\r\nproved, advanced towards the General to offer his support. The same was\r\ndone by Col. Hamilton and Major Edwards under a similar apprehension.\r\nGeneral Lee then said the wound was inconsiderable; less than he had\r\nimagined at the first stroke of the ball, and proposed to fire a\r\nsecond time. This was warmly opposed both by Col. Hamilton and Major\r\nEdwards, who declared it to be their opinion, that the affair should\r\nterminate as it then stood. But General Lee repeated his desire,\r\nthat there should be a second discharge, and Col. Laurens agreed to\r\nthe proposal. Col. Hamilton observed that, unless the General was\r\ninfluenced by motives of personal enmity, he did not think the affair\r\nought to be pursued any further; but as Gen. Lee seemed to persist in\r\ndesiring it, he was too tender of his friend’s honor to persist in\r\nopposing it. The combat was then going to be renewed; but Major Edwards\r\nagain declaring his opinion, that the affair ought to end where it was,\r\nGen. Lee then expressed his confidence in the honor of the gentlemen\r\nconcerned as seconds, and said he should be willing to comply with\r\nwhatever they should coolly and deliberately determine. Col. Laurens\r\nconsented to the same.\r\n\r\nCol. Hamilton and Major Edwards withdrew, and conversing awhile on the\r\nsubject, still concurred fully in the opinion, that for the most urgent\r\nreasons, the affair should terminate as it was then circumstanced. This\r\ndecision was communicated to the parties and agreed to by them, upon\r\nwhich they immediately returned to town; General Lee slightly wounded\r\nin the right side.\r\n\r\nDuring the interview a conversation to the following purport passed\r\nbetween General Lee and Col. Laurens. On Col. Hamilton’s intimating\r\nthe idea of personal enmity, as before mentioned--Gen. Lee declared he\r\nhad none, and had only met Col. Laurens, to defend his own honor--that\r\nMr. Laurens best knew whether there was any on his part. Col. Laurens\r\nreplied, that General Lee was acquainted with the motives that had\r\nbrought him there, which were, that he had been informed from what he\r\nthought good authority, that Gen. Lee had spoken of General Washington\r\nin the grossest and most opprobrious terms of personal abuse, which he,\r\nCol. Laurens, thought himself bound to resent, as well on account of\r\nthe relation he bore to General Washington, as from motives of personal\r\nfriendship and respect for his character. General Lee acknowledged\r\nthat he had given his opinion against General Washington’s military\r\ncharacter to his particular friends, and might perhaps do it again. He\r\nsaid every man had a right to give his sentiments freely of military\r\ncharacters, and that he did not think himself personally accountable\r\nto Col. Laurens for what he had done in that respect. But he said he\r\nnever had spoken of General Washington in the terms mentioned, which\r\nhe could not have done; as well because he had always esteemed General\r\nWashington as a man, as because such abuse would be incompatible with\r\nthe character he would ever wish to sustain as a gentleman.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, we think it a piece of justice to the two gentlemen to\r\ndeclare, that after they met, their conduct was strongly marked with\r\nall the politeness, generosity, coolness and firmness, that ought to\r\ncharacterize a transaction of this nature.\r\n\r\n                                            Alexander Hamilton.\r\n                                            Ev. Edwards.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, December 24th, 1778.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDUPLESSIS TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       11 Janvier, 1779.\r\n\r\nJe n’ai point reçu, mon cher Hamilton, les papiers que vous deviez\r\nm’envoyer avec Les Signes en chiffres.\r\n\r\nSi vous désirez ce dont nous étions convenu, lorsqueje partis du\r\nquartier Général, remettez le tout à M. De la Colombe, qui dans deux\r\nmois part pour France. Je vous promets beaucoup de vérité et jeu\r\nd’esprit dans la narration.\r\n\r\nDans peu de minutes, nous voguerons; présentez mon respect à son\r\nExcellence, et mes amitiés à toute votre famille. Souvenez-vous de tout\r\nce que je vous ai dit à mon départ et soyez homme de parole.\r\n\r\nAdieu, soyez sûr que vous avez en moi un bon et vrai ami; n’en doutez\r\npoint, et vous rendrez justice.\r\n\r\n                                        Le Chevalier Duplessis.\r\n\r\n  Col. Hamilton,\r\n  Aid-de-Camp of\r\n  His Excellency General Washington,\r\n                      Head Quarters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Head Quarters, March 14, 1779.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nColonel Laurens, who will have the honor of delivering you this letter,\r\nis on his way to South Carolina, on a project which I think, in the\r\npresent situation of affairs there, is a very good one, and deserves\r\nevery kind of support and encouragement. This is, to raise two, three,\r\nor four battalions of negroes, with the assistance of the government\r\nof that State, by contributions from the owners, in proportion to the\r\nnumber they possess. If you should think proper to enter upon the\r\nsubject with him, he will give you a detail of his plan. He wishes to\r\nhave it recommended by Congress to the State; and, as an inducement,\r\nthat they would engage to take their battalions into Continental pay.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me, that an expedient of this kind, in the present\r\nstate of Southern affairs, is the most rational that can be adopted,\r\nand promises very important advantages. Indeed, I hardly see how a\r\nsufficient force can be collected in that quarter without it: and\r\nthe enemy’s operations there are growing infinitely serious and\r\nformidable. I have not the least doubt, that the negroes will make\r\nvery excellent soldiers, with proper management: and I will venture\r\nto pronounce, that they cannot be put in better hands than those of\r\nMr. Laurens. He has all the zeal, intelligence, enterprise, and every\r\nother qualification, requisite to succeed in such an undertaking.\r\nIt is a maxim with some great military judges, that, with sensible\r\nofficers, soldiers can hardly be too stupid: and, on this principle,\r\nit is thought that the Russians would make the best soldiers in the\r\nworld, if they were under other officers than their own. The King of\r\nPrussia is among the number who maintains this doctrine, and has a very\r\nemphatic saying on the occasion, which I do not exactly recollect. I\r\nmention this because I have frequently heard it objected to the scheme\r\nof embodying negroes, that they are too stupid to make soldiers. This\r\nis so far from appearing to me a valid objection, that I think their\r\nwant of cultivation (for their natural faculties are as good as ours),\r\njoined to that habit of subordination which they acquire from a life of\r\nservitude, will enable them sooner to become soldiers than our white\r\ninhabitants. Let officers be men of sense and sentiment; and the nearer\r\nthe soldiers approach to machines, perhaps the better.\r\n\r\nI foresee that this project will have to combat much opposition from\r\nprejudice and self-interest. The contempt we have been taught to\r\nentertain for the blacks, makes us fancy many things that are founded\r\nneither in reason nor experience; and an unwillingness to part with\r\nproperty of so valuable a kind, will furnish a thousand arguments to\r\nshow the impracticability, or pernicious tendency, of a scheme which\r\nrequires such sacrifices. But it should be considered, that if we do\r\nnot make use of them in this way, the enemy probably will; and that\r\nthe best way to counteract the temptations they will hold out, will\r\nbe, to offer them ourselves. An essential part of the plan is, to give\r\nthem their freedom with their swords. This will secure their fidelity,\r\nanimate their courage, and, I believe, will have a good influence\r\nupon those who remain, by opening a door to their emancipation. This\r\ncircumstance, I confess, has no small weight in inducing me to wish the\r\nsuccess of the project; for the dictates of humanity, and true policy,\r\nequally interest me in favor of this unfortunate class of men.\r\n\r\nWhile I am on the subject of southern affairs, you will excuse the\r\nliberty I take in saying, that I do not think measures sufficiently\r\nvigorous are pursuing for our defence in that quarter. Except the few\r\nregular troops of South Carolina, we seem to be relying wholly on the\r\nmilitia of that and the two neighboring States. These will soon grow\r\nimpatient of service, and leave our affairs in a miserable situation.\r\nNo considerable force can be uniformly kept up by militia; to say\r\nnothing of the many obvious and well-known inconveniences that attend\r\nthis kind of troops. I would beg leave to suggest, Sir, that no time\r\nought to be lost in making a draught of militia to serve a twelvemonth,\r\nfrom the States of North and South Carolina and Virginia. But South\r\nCarolina, being very weak in her population of whites, may be excused\r\nfrom the draught, on condition of furnishing the black battalions.\r\nThe two others may furnish about three thousand five hundred men, and\r\nbe exempted, on that account, from sending any succors to this army.\r\nThe States to the northward of Virginia, will be fully able to give\r\ncompetent supplies to the army here; and it will require all the force\r\nand exertions of the three States I have mentioned, to withstand the\r\nstorm which has arisen, and is increasing in the South.\r\n\r\nThe troops draughted, must be thrown into battalions, and officered in\r\nthe best possible manner. The supernumerary officers may be made use\r\nof as far as they will go. If arms are wanted for their troops, and\r\nno better way of supplying them is to be found, we should endeavor to\r\nlevy a contribution of arms upon the militia at large. Extraordinary\r\nexigencies demand extraordinary means. I fear this southern business\r\nwill become a very _grave_ one.\r\n\r\n                                  With the truest respect and esteem,\r\n                                  I am, Sir, your most obedient servant,\r\n                                  Alex. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n  His Excell’y John Jay,\r\n  President of Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO BARON STEUBEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           May 26, 1779.\r\n\r\nThe General, on reflection, is a little uneasy about the route you\r\nintend to take. He thinks it not quite safe, as the enemy have troops\r\non Long Island and may easily throw a party across the Sound, so that\r\nyou would be in danger of having your agreeable dreams interrupted, if\r\nyou should sleep any where from New Haven to Fairfield.\r\n\r\nIt is probable, one of the Count’s motives in coming this way may be\r\nto see the ruins of those places; and if he could do it without risk,\r\nit would be desirable; but he would not probably be at his ease, if\r\nin consequence of it, he should be obliged to attend the levee of Sir\r\nHenry Clinton. This may happen if he continues his intention, unless\r\nvery good precautions are taken to avoid the danger. The General\r\nrecommends it to you, at least to be very vigilant upon your post, and\r\nnot to suffer yourself to be surprised. You will be so good as to let\r\nus have timely notice of your approach, as we shall, at least, meet you\r\nat Fishkill Landing, with boats to take you down to Head Quarters.\r\n\r\n                                I have the honor to be,\r\n                                Your affectionate and respectful friend,\r\n                                A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO OTHO H. WILLIAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                        11th June, 1779.\r\n\r\nDear Williams:\r\n\r\nThe General sends you four fresh horsemen to enable you to transmit\r\nhim intelligence. The General will take the road you marched to your\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\nMind your eye, my dear boy, and if you have an opportunity, fight hard.\r\n\r\n                                                Your friend and servant,\r\n                                                A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO MAJOR LEE, OR IN HIS ABSENCE, CAPT. McLANE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                             July, 1779.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nThere is an encampment of the enemy, or a demonstration of one, which\r\nappears on the other side of the river, considerably on this side of\r\nTarry Town. You will be pleased in consequence to have patrols kept\r\nfrom this till morning, seven or eight miles down along the shore and\r\non the roads leading to this place on our right. This might be a\r\ncritical night, and demands the greatest vigilance.\r\n\r\n                                             I am, Sir,\r\n                                             Your most obedient servant,\r\n                                             A. Hamilton,\r\n                                             Aid-de-Camp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY LAURENS TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Philadelphia, 29th July, 1779.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nIn addition to the lines which I troubled you with the day before\r\nyesterday by Colonel, or I should say Doctor McHenry; he is an honest\r\nman with either, or without any title, permit me to inform you. I\r\npresented to Congress this morning, Colonel Fleury’s earnest request\r\nfor the flag which he had the glory of lowering at Stony Point, but\r\nthere was not a single voice heard in second to my motion. In truth, I\r\nhad spoken to several of the members on the subject before the meeting\r\nof Congress; these discovered not only no inclination, but rather an\r\naversion to parting with so high a testimony of a great and brilliant\r\nvictory; nevertheless, I determined to fulfil my promise; you see\r\nthe success. Fancy often fills up the chasms made by disappointments\r\nof this kind; many of the most celebrated Italian originals in the\r\ncabinets of curious fanciful men in England, are good copies. Suppose\r\nin the present instance the Colonel should order an accurate likeness\r\nof the first flag to be made, and content himself with that, or that\r\nby a very trifling practice of ambidexterity, he should exchange\r\nthe copy for the original; or suppose he should take a much better\r\nand less exceptionable method for accomplishing his wishes, that he\r\nshould arm himself with one of Dunlap’s Packets, in which his gallant\r\nbehavior and the particular feat of cutting the halliards, stand upon\r\nrecord by authority of Congress; this might be kept in the tin case\r\nwith commissions and testimonials, answer every purpose of display,\r\nand save the trouble and expense of lugging sixty or eighty yards of\r\nbunting round the Globe.\r\n\r\nI have executed my commission; have added my best consolatory advice\r\nto a disappointed client, and trust the Colonel will do me the justice\r\nto assure himself, my own opinion on the propriety of his suit was not\r\ndisclosed fully or partially to any body before I had received a modest\r\ndenial by a profound silence.\r\n\r\nNothing new from South Carolina, excepting a delegate, who left\r\nCharleston one day before the date of our late letters.\r\n\r\n                                          I have the honor to be,\r\n                                          With great esteem and respect,\r\n                                          Dear Sir,\r\n                                          Your ob’t and humble serv’t,\r\n                                          Henry Laurens.\r\n\r\nCol. A. Hamilton, Head Quarters, North River.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLONEL FLEURY TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           L’Infantery Camp, 18th August, 1779.\r\n\r\nDear Colonel:\r\n\r\nThe officers of the two A Battalions of l’Infantery, which I actually\r\ncommand, have applied to me for ceasing to run over those craggy\r\nmountains barefooted, and beg that I would write to head quarters to\r\nhave an order from his Excellency to get one pair of shoes for each;\r\nthe shoes they hint to are at New Windsor, and their intention is to\r\npay for.\r\n\r\nDo not be so greedy for shoes as for my blanket, and think that the\r\nmost urgent necessity has determined their application; they are quite\r\nbarefooted.\r\n\r\n                                            I am very respectfully, Sir,\r\n                                            Your most obedient servant,\r\n                                            L. Fleury.\r\n\r\nN. B. As his Excellency could form a very advantageous idea of our\r\nbeing lucky in shoes by the appearance of the officers who dined\r\nto-day at head quarters, and were not quite without, I beg you would\r\nobserve to him, if necessary, that each company had furnished a shoe\r\nfor their dressing.\r\n\r\n                                    Camp l’Infantery, 19th August, 1779.\r\n\r\nSi vous savez un mot de M. De La Luzerne dites le moi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO JAMES DUANE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                      August 28th, 1779.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nI with pleasure snatch a moment, agreeable to your request, to inform\r\nyou of the events which have taken place since you left us. A York\r\npaper of the 24th, announces the arrival of the Russell of 74, which\r\nparted three days before from Arbuthnot’s fleet, which was of course\r\nmomently expected. Subsequent intelligence gives us the arrival of the\r\nwhole fleet. This comes through different channels, and is believed;\r\nbut we have no particulars. _Wayne is still safe._\r\n\r\nNorthern news says that Sir George Collier, having appeared in\r\nPenobscot River, put our grand fleet to the rout. They were run ashore,\r\nabandoned, and burnt; the troops and seamen safe. Colonel Jackson’s\r\nregiment, which had been sent as a reinforcement, landed at Portsmouth.\r\nThis account comes in a letter from General Gates to Colonel Hay.\r\nTo counterbalance the bad in a degree, he tells me three of our\r\nContinental frigates were arrived at Boston with six sail out of ten of\r\nthe Jamaica fleet which had fallen into their hands, containing 5000\r\nhdds. of rum and sugar.\r\n\r\n                                     I have the honor to be,\r\n                                     Very faithfully and affectionately,\r\n                                     Your most obedient servant,\r\n                                     A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nHon. Mr. Duane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBARON STEUBEN TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                      August 30th, 1779.\r\n\r\nMr. De la Luzerne desires me to join him on his route, to accompany him\r\nto head quarters. I shall depart on Tuesday morning for Providence,\r\nwhere I may require three days to review the regiments; after which I\r\nshall return immediately to Hartford to join the Minister.\r\n\r\nI promised to give you a picture of his new Excellency. He is about\r\nthirty-six years of age, though he appears younger. In the last war he\r\nwas aid-de-camp to Marshal Broglio. He appears to be a man of solid\r\nsense, and less presumptuous than the people of quality in that country\r\nusually are. His manners are prepossessing; and they would be more so\r\nif he could speak English. His character appears to me to be good; and\r\nhe is less reserved than European Ministers usually are. His personal\r\nappearance will not displease the ladies of Philadelphia. He is a young\r\nchevalier of Malta, who is not so much imbrowned by his crusades, but\r\nthat the American beauties will take pains to teach him English in a\r\nshort time. His Secretary, Mr. Marbois, is a counsellor of Parliament,\r\nfrom Metz in Lorraine--speaks good English; and is a man who shows much\r\ninformation and judgment.\r\n\r\n                                                       Steuben.\r\n\r\nCol.

Wadsworth is gone away perfectly satisfied. It is\r\na circumstance to their honor that amidst all their wants and\r\ndistresses--flour and carriage have been supplied at 25 per cent. less\r\nthan in any part of the Continent: and that by a law of the State. If\r\nit had produced the effect to be expected from so spirited an example,\r\nit must have had a powerful influence on our money: but it is to be\r\nlamented that we stood _single_, and that our citizens are impoverished\r\nby a sacrifice of a fourth of their produce and labor to little purpose.\r\n\r\nBe kind enough to forward the inclosed to Lt. Col. Washington;\r\nand to present my respectful compliments to his Excellency the\r\nCommander-in-Chief and the family; and believe me to be, with real\r\nesteem and affection,\r\n\r\n                                                 Dear Col.,\r\n                                                 Your most ob’t servant,\r\n                                                 James Duane.\r\n\r\nCol.

De la Luzerne to\r\nthe General; agreeably to which we shall take our measures on the\r\nreception of this private public gentleman. We had prepared a party of\r\nCavalry to receive him at Fishkill, on the supposition that he would\r\nset out with an escort from Boston; but we have now sent orders to the\r\nparty immediately to take the route you mention to Hartford, and there\r\nplace themselves under your orders.\r\n\r\nThe General requests you will make his respectful compliments to your\r\nChevalier, and gives you carte blanche to say every handsome thing you\r\nthink proper in his name, of the pleasure which this visit will give\r\nhim. I have no doubt that your portrait, which appears to be executed\r\nen maitre, will be found a just representation of the original; and if\r\nhe is as happy as his predecessor in gaining the esteem and confidence\r\nof the _men_ of this country, with so many talents to conciliate the\r\nleaders, his ministry will not be unsuccessful. I augur well for him.\r\nGen. Washington proposes to meet him as a private gentleman at Fishkill.\r\n\r\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO DUANE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          Sept. 7, 1779.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir:\r\n\r\nI this day received your letter of the 4th, with one inclosed for Col.\r\nWashington, which was immediately forwarded. You do not mention the\r\nreceipt of a line from me which I wrote several days since, giving you\r\nan account of Arbuthnot’s arrival.\r\n\r\nThe current of our intelligence makes the reinforcement with him amount\r\nto about three thousand, mostly recruits and in bad health; it is said\r\nsome preparations are making for an expedition, and there are various\r\nconjectures about the object; some point to the Southward; perhaps\r\nthe true destination is the West Indies. But, I confess, I should not\r\nbe surprised, if the enemy should make a further and vigorous attempt\r\nto gain possession of two or three of the Southern States. If their\r\naffairs are so desperate with respect to alliance as we are told, the\r\nobject of the war on their side, from conquest must necessarily change\r\nto pacification. The acquisition of two or three of the Southern States\r\nwould be a handsome counterpoise to their losses in the Islands, and\r\nwould enable them to negotiate with the more credit and success the\r\nensuing winter.\r\n\r\nI am happy to have it in my power to gratify your curiosity about the\r\nWestern expedition with the inclosed agreeable account. It is the\r\nsubstance of a letter from General Sullivan of the 30th, extracted\r\nat Col. Hay’s request, for Mr. Lowdon’s paper. The facts are all\r\ntrue, though you will perceive I have given it a few of the usual\r\nembellishments of a newspaper paragraph. I have not specified the\r\nnumber of Gen Sullivan’s wounded; they amount to thirty-nine, among\r\nwhich are Major Titcomb and two other officers. This is a pleasing and\r\nI hope decisive event.\r\n\r\nIn haste, but with the greatest esteem and regard,\r\n\r\n                                        I have the honor to be your most\r\n                                        Obed’t servant,\r\n                                        Alex. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOL. LEE TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                         Sept. 10, 1779.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir:\r\n\r\nI wish you would send me a copy of General Washington’s letter of\r\ninstructions to me--a copy of General Orders on the subject of the\r\n19th and the sentence of the Court and trial. The emissaries from the\r\nVirginia party have been industrious to injure my military character.\r\n\r\n                                                     I am, dear Sir,\r\n                                                     Yours sincerely,\r\n                                                     Henry Lee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDUANE TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                         Sept. 10, 1779.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nAccept my thanks for your favor of the 28th of August, and your\r\nobliging assurances that you will comply with my request. Unless my\r\nanxiety in the events of the campaign had been very great, I should\r\nnot have been so unreasonable as to impose this burthen on any of my\r\nmuch respected friends at head quarters; well knowing that they, of all\r\nothers, have the least leisure. I find the British reinforcement is\r\narrived. To me it brings no terror, as I think we have the strongest\r\nevidence that it was not originally intended to exceed four thousand\r\nmen, and these raw recruits. You say Wayne is still safe. Let him keep\r\na sharp look out; for I still hold the opinion, that Sir Henry Clinton\r\nis bound in honor to chastise him, for one of the most daring and\r\ninsolent assaults that is to be found in the records of chivalry; an\r\nachievement so brilliant in itself--so romantic in the scale of British\r\nadmiration--that none but a hero, inspired by the fortitude, instructed\r\nby the wisdom, and guided by the planet of Washington, could, by the\r\nexploit at Paulus Hook, have furnished materials in the page of history\r\nto give it a parallel. * * You see from this how much I am at my ease.\r\n\r\nTo know the value of domestic enjoyment, next to head quarters, I\r\nrecommend the chair at the Board of Treasury, for ten months of a\r\nsession, in which both our friends and foes are waging a successful war\r\nagainst the public credit.\r\n\r\nPresent my affectionate regard to His Excellency, and the family, and\r\nbelieve me, with every friendly sentiment,\r\n\r\n                                  Your affectionate and devoted servant,\r\n                                  James Duane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO DUANE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    West Point, Sept. 14, 1779.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir:\r\n\r\nI do not recollect whether I said any thing in my last about the\r\nstrength of the reinforcement with Arbuthnot. All the accounts agree\r\nthat it does not exceed 3000, mostly recruits, and in very bad health;\r\nit is said more than a thousand died on the passage, and the greater\r\npart of the remainder are journeying fast to the other world. Disease\r\nprevails also in the other parts of the army and among the inhabitants,\r\nmore than has been known at any time, since the enemy has been in\r\npossession of the city. They have been of late making extensive\r\npreparations for embarking troops, and we have just received advice,\r\nthat two German and one British regiment sailed from New-York on the\r\n11th, under convoy of a Sixty-four. The rumors about the destination\r\nare various. The West Indies, Georgia, Canada, are all talked of, but\r\nthe first with most confidence, and is no doubt most probable; our\r\nintelligence announces a continuance of the embarkation.\r\n\r\nA vessel lately arrived at Boston from the Cape, reports that\r\nshe sailed from that place in company with Count D’Estaing, with\r\ntwenty-five sail of the line, and some transports, containing 6000\r\ntroops taken in at the Cape, and bound first for Georgia and afterward\r\nfarther Northward. She parted with the fleet in latitude 25, longitude\r\n74. Two other vessels, arrived at some place in Connecticut,\r\npretend that they parted with a French fleet of men of war, and\r\ntransports, in the latitude of Bermuda, steering for this coast. These\r\nconcurrent accounts are not entirely unworthy of attention, though I am\r\nnot disposed to give them entire credit.\r\n\r\nThe reduction of the enemy’s fleets and armies in this country, would\r\nbe the surest method to effect the complete conquest of the Islands;\r\nand it would be one of the most fatal strokes Great Britain could\r\nreceive. The stamina of their Military Establishment are in this\r\ncountry. The ruin of this, and the capture of their seamen and ships,\r\nwould be an irrecoverable loss. The West Indies would scarcely have\r\nany further prospect of succor, and would be obliged to submit to the\r\npower of France almost without resistance; which might then operate at\r\nleisure, aided by ample supplies from this continent, which I believe\r\nare the principal thing wanting.\r\n\r\nThese reasons may have induced the Count to make us a visit, during\r\nthe season of inactivity in the West Indies; or if he does not come\r\nhimself, if by forming a junction with the Spanish fleet, he can make\r\na detachment this way, and still maintain a superiority for operation\r\nin that quarter, this perhaps will make the event more probable, than\r\non the former supposition. I have now given you all the intelligence\r\nwe have, and have mixed certainties, rumors, and conjectures. You will\r\nextract and believe as much as you think proper. I shall only add, that\r\nI am with the most perfect esteem and attachment,\r\n\r\n                                                Dear Sir,\r\n                                                Your most obed’t serv’t,\r\n                                                A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nThe General and family charge me to present their most affectionate\r\nrespects. We are to receive the new Minister to-morrow morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDUANE TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Manor of Livingston, 16th September, 1779.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Col.:\r\n\r\nI have had no earlier opportunity to acknowledge the receipt of your\r\nvery agreeable favor of the 7th instant. To yours of the ---- I\r\ntransmitted an answer by the post.\r\n\r\nI perfectly agree in opinion with you what the enemy ought in good\r\nfeeling to attempt; but as they uniformly contravene their best\r\ninterests, and pursue measures which can produce the least possible\r\nadvantage, I conclude they will not persevere in the system of\r\nattacking us in our weakest side--the Southern States. They may too,\r\nby this time, have some reason for declining what a more enterprising\r\npeople would hazard at any event. I think I intimated to you that I\r\nshould not be surprised if Count D’Estaing paid a visit to our coast\r\nthis fall. Reports prevail which announce his approach. In that case\r\nthey will be as safe in New-York as at Savannah or Charleston; and\r\nit is no slander to say, that the _safety_ of their army has all\r\nalong been their first object. I have many reasons to be anxious for\r\nthe expedition against the Six Nations. No less than the safety of\r\nour Northern and Western frontiers depends upon its success; to say\r\nnothing of the vast national advantages which will be derived from the\r\nreduction of these perfidious savages. By the way, what will the world\r\nthink of our spirit and our resources, when at the very instant our\r\nenemies, foreign and domestic, pronounced our immediate ruin from the\r\nembarrassment of our finances, and a series of heavy calamities under\r\nwhich they affirmed we were expiring, they see their grand army cooped\r\nup in a garrison; their forts taken from them by unparalleled bravery;\r\nthe country of their Indian allies ravaged and destroyed without\r\na single effort for their protection; and a capital naval armament\r\nequipped by a single State, which it required misconduct _perhaps_,\r\non our part, and _certainly_ the most hazardous efforts on theirs, to\r\ndefeat! I wait with great impatience for further intelligence from\r\nGeneral Sullivan’s army. I am not sufficiently acquainted with the\r\ncountry to form a clear idea of their intended route; but if they\r\nvisit the Senecas effectually, I suppose we soon shall hear from them\r\nat Conodeseraga, the chief Seneca town, where our State, so long ago\r\nas 1732, made a large purchase for a settlement, to keep them in, but\r\nwhich was not prosecuted on account of the turbulent and faithless\r\ntemper of the Senecas, and the want of vigor in our own Government.\r\n\r\nI must close, or lose the opportunity by a sloop passing to New\r\nWindsor. Be so good as to pay my most respectful compliments to His\r\nExcellency, the family, Generals McDougal, Greene and Knox, and _if he\r\nis still safe_, to G. Wayne; and believe me to be with great regard,\r\nand a disposition to do you every possible service,\r\n\r\n                                             Your most obedient servant,\r\n                                             Jas. Duane.\r\n\r\nCol. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDUANE TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Manor Livingston, 23d September, 1779.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir:\r\n\r\nI am obliged much by your kind attention to me. The condition of our\r\nenemies, instead of being formidable, as they predicted, seems daily\r\nto become more feeble; and instead of those vigorous and decisive\r\noperations, which could alone have revived their declining cause, and\r\nkept up the spirits of their infatuated adherents, we see nothing but\r\nlanguor, discontent, and disgust in their army, their fields, and their\r\ncouncils. Their king alone, as if literally hardened by a judicial\r\nblindness, persists in his obstinate folly, and courts the destruction\r\nof the British Empire. If, in addition to all his other wants,\r\ndistresses, and misfortunes, sickness has taken a deep root among his\r\ntroops, and his partisans; a decisive period must in all probability be\r\nspeedily put to the mad career.\r\n\r\nCount d’Estaing seems to have the ball at his feet. His command of\r\nthe ocean must be indisputable when he is joined by the Spanish\r\nsquadron lately at Havana. He may divide his force, subdue the West\r\nIndia Islands, and assist us in expelling or captivating the remnant\r\nof our enemies on this continent. I have, however, some distrust of\r\nthe Count’s _planet_. His former ill luck on our coast has led me to\r\nthink that he is no _Felix_. I conclude not much from the advantages\r\nhe acquired over Biron; for that man is marked for the child of\r\nmisfortune, and I dare say if his nativity was cast, it would appear\r\nthat his star foreboded decapitation and disgrace. Believe me, I never\r\nmeddled with the black art, nor am I over superstitious, and yet I\r\ndiscern that I am not altogether free from a prejudice which was very\r\nremarkable in the greatest nation of antiquity. Hence it is that I so\r\nanxiously look for the fortunate completion of our western expedition;\r\neven when a train of favorable events renders it so highly probable.\r\n\r\nBe so good as to present my affectionate and respectful compliments to\r\nthe General and all the family; and believe that I shall be happy in\r\nevery opportunity to convince you that I am sincerely,\r\n\r\n                                                  Your friend and\r\n                                                  Most obedient servant,\r\n                                                  Jas. Duane.\r\n\r\nP. S. How do you like the new Minister of France? I have a letter from\r\nG. Schuyler. In the course of a week I expect him here, and shall\r\nprobably accompany him on a visit to the General and our friends at\r\nhead quarters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO DUANE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                        October 1, 1779.\r\n\r\nI am much obliged to you, my dear sir, for your two letters of the\r\n16th and 23d. In haste I snatch up my pen by an express going off to\r\nthe Governor, to give you the news as it runs. The most important and\r\nbest authenticated is, that Count D’Estaing was arrived on the coast of\r\nGeorgia. The tale runs thus. We are in possession of a Charleston paper\r\nof the 6th of September, which mentions that the Viscount de Fontagnes\r\nhad arrived at that place, sent by the Count to announce his approach.\r\nMr. Mitchel, who transmits the paper, adds,--that by the express\r\nwhich brought it, Mr. Gerard had received dispatches from the Count,\r\ninforming him of his intention to attack the enemy in Georgia on the\r\n9th; that in consequence of this intelligence Mr. Gerard had postponed\r\nhis voyage a few days to be the bearer of the event. This, I hope, puts\r\na period to the danger of the Southern States, for which I could not\r\nhelp having strong apprehensions, notwithstanding the presumption drawn\r\nfrom the enemies’ past folly against their pursuing any plan favorable\r\nto their interest. I acknowledge the force of the argument, but I was\r\nafraid they might for once blunder upon the right way. The departure of\r\nCornwallis on the 25th, with the Grenadiers, Light Infantry, and one\r\nBritish regiment, had increased my horrors on this subject. The nature\r\nof this corps pointed to a temporary service for some important coup\r\nde main. Charleston presented itself as the only object. They would\r\nhardly separate the flower of their troops for any remote and permanent\r\nstation. They are continuing their embarkation. The accounts we have\r\nof the particular corps carry them to between five and six thousand.\r\nI send you a Boston paper of the 23d, containing some interesting\r\nEuropean advices.\r\n\r\n                          Your most respectful and affectionate servant,\r\n                          Alex. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nP. S. The General is happy in the hopes you give him of a speedy\r\nvisit from General Schuyler and yourself, and orders me to present his\r\nrespects to both. The family join in every sentiment of perfect esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON TO COUNT D’ESTAING.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Head Quarters, West Point, October 7th, 1779.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nSince my letter to your Excellency on the 4th instant, I have had\r\nthe honor of a visit from his Excellency, Monsieur Gerard. In the\r\nconversation we had relative to a co-operation with the fleet and\r\ntroops under your command, he expressed his doubts of its being\r\npossible for you to continue such a length of time as may be essential\r\nto the success of the undertaking, and which alone could justify me\r\nin going into those extensive preparations absolutely necessary on\r\nour part. I have therefore appointed Brigadier General Du Portail and\r\nColonel Hamilton to wait upon your Excellency as speedily as possible,\r\nand explain to you fully my ideas of the proposed co-operation--the\r\nmeans we shall be able to employ--the obstacles we shall have to\r\nencounter on our side--the plans which it may be proper to pursue,\r\nand the measures which are taking and may be taken by the enemy to\r\ncounteract them. This will enable your Excellency to determine what you\r\ncan with propriety undertake. I shall only add, that if your Excellency\r\nwill engage to co-operate with your whole naval and land force against\r\nthe enemy’s fleet and army at New-York, till the winter is so far\r\nadvanced that the ice will make it impracticable to remain with your\r\nfleet any longer in port, I will bring twenty-five thousand effective\r\nmen into the field, and will exert all the resources of the country in\r\na vigorous and decided co-operation. Without this assurance on the part\r\nof your Excellency, it would be inconsistent with my duty to the public\r\nand to the common cause, to incur the expense and hazard which would be\r\ninseparable from the enterprise, and the more disagreeable consequences\r\nwhich would attend a failure. I flatter myself your Excellency will be\r\nfully sensible of the weight of the reasons, on which this declaration\r\nis founded, and will approve the frankness with which it is made, and\r\nwith which I have instructed General Du Portail and Colonel Hamilton to\r\ndisclose to you every circumstance, and every consideration with which\r\nit is necessary you should be acquainted. If your determination should\r\nbe in favor of the enterprise, I request you will honor me with a line\r\nin answer to this letter, expressive of your ultimate intentions, and\r\nthat you will communicate to the gentlemen who now wait upon you, the\r\nprevious measures you propose to pursue, and your sentiments of the\r\nmost eligible plan of co-operation. I shall act in consequence, till\r\nthe period arrives for concerting a final and more determinate plan.\r\n\r\nI would now observe to your Excellency, that you may repose the most\r\nimplicit confidence in General Du Portail and Colonel Hamilton, and\r\naccordingly I recommend them to your kind civilities and attention.\r\nAnd, having done this, I have only to renew the assurances of that\r\nsincere attachment and perfect respect with which I have the honor to be\r\n\r\n                                                 Your Excellency’s\r\n                                                 Most obedient servant,\r\n                                                 G. Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY LEE TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Mandlopen, October 15th, 1779.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nI have your letters of the 9th and 18th October. The pilots have orders\r\none half to proceed to Lewistown, there to wait on you.\r\n\r\nThe route I cannot yet determine, as I am not sufficiently acquainted.\r\nThey will be sent the shortest, and every assistance given them to\r\nexpedite their arrival.\r\n\r\nShould you leave the Capes before they get there, it would be\r\nnecessary to dispatch a courier to cross at Dover and pursue the Jersey\r\nroute with directions for them. Yourself or courier must meet them.\r\n\r\nMy intelligence corresponds exactly with the information obtained from\r\nCaptain Monroe and transmitted you from head quarters.\r\n\r\nRhode Island was not evacuated when my last accounts arrived, but\r\nwill be on the Count’s appearance. Transports are ready there for the\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nSandy Hook, the Narrows, and Governor’s Island are strongly fortified.\r\nBe assured of my execution of your wishes, and that\r\n\r\n                                           I am your friend and servant,\r\n                                           Henry Lee.\r\n\r\nCol. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON AND DU PORTAIL.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Head Quarters, West Point, Oct. 18, 1779.\r\n\r\nGentlemen:\r\n\r\nI have been favored with Colonel Hamilton’s letter, mentioning your\r\narrival early on the 11th, at Philadelphia, and your being about to set\r\noff for Lewistown on the morning on which it was written.\r\n\r\nI have attentively considered the object to which you more particularly\r\nrefer, and am now to authorize you (provided the Count will not\r\ndetermine on a co-operation to the full extent of my instructions), to\r\nengage the whole force described in my letters to him, comprehending\r\nthe Continental troops and militia, in such an enterprise against\r\nthe enemy’s shipping, as the Count and you may agree to undertake.\r\nIn a word, I will aid him in every plan of operations against the\r\nenemy at New-York, or Rhode Island, in the most effectual manner that\r\nour strength and resources will admit. He has nothing more to do,\r\ntherefore, than to propose his own plan, if time will not admit him\r\nto accede to ours; weighing thoroughly, consequences of expense and\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\nInclosed is some intelligence received from Elizabethtown since your\r\ndeparture. You will observe the preparations of the enemy for throwing\r\nevery possible obstruction in the Count’s passage.\r\n\r\nA chain of alarm ships are stationed in the Sound, to communicate the\r\nfirst approach of the Count’s fleet to the garrison at Rhode Island.\r\nThis they can propagate in a few minutes by signal guns. In a letter\r\nfrom General Gates of the 13th instant, he advises me of the arrival\r\nof the fleet, which some time ago sailed from New-York. It amounts to\r\nfifty-six sail, and appeared to be only in a set of ballast. This was\r\nconfirmed by one of the vessels which fell into our hands for a few\r\nhours. The opinion is, that it is designed to take off the garrison.\r\n\r\nGeneral Gates makes the marine force at Newport, one fifty, and a\r\nthirty-two gun frigate. The Refugee and Wood fleet, about thirty-seven\r\nsail, mostly armed, at the head of which is the Restoration, late the\r\nOliver Cromwell, of twenty-two guns. One frigate is also taken notice\r\nof in the fleet from New-York.\r\n\r\nShould the operations against New-York, in either case, be undertaken,\r\nit will be of the utmost consequence to block up the garrison at Rhode\r\nIsland. You will consider the propriety of suggesting to the Count,\r\nthe detaching of a superior sea force for this purpose, previous to\r\nhis approaching the Hook. For, should the measure be deferred till his\r\narrival there, it may not then be possible to prevent their junction\r\nwith the army at New-York, as the notice can be so very suddenly\r\ntransmitted by means of the signals which they have established.\r\n\r\nEvery proper attention has been given to preparing the necessary\r\nnumber of fascines, and such other materials as may be requisite in\r\nthis quarter. Fascines, gabions, etc., are also held in readiness at\r\nProvidence in case of an operation against Newport. I had thought\r\nof the fire ships, and have taken order in the matter. I do not,\r\nhowever, choose to go to the great expense they must run us into, till\r\nsomething is decided with His Excellency Count D’Estaing; but every\r\nthing relative shall be provided, so as to occasion no delay when such\r\nmatters become necessary.\r\n\r\n                                             I am, Gentlemen,\r\n                                             Your most obedient servant,\r\n                                             G. Washington.\r\n\r\nBrigadier-General Du Portail.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON AND DU PORTAIL.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  West Point, October 21, 1779.\r\n\r\nGentlemen:\r\n\r\nIn my letters of the tenth and eighteenth, I transmitted all the\r\nintelligence I had obtained respecting the enemy, from the time of\r\nyour departure to those two periods: and by the present conveyance, I\r\ninclose you an extract of a letter from Major-General Gates, of the\r\n15th. By this you will perceive, he was fully persuaded that the enemy\r\nare now preparing to evacuate Rhode Island; and he expected, from his\r\nadvices, they would do it on Monday or Tuesday last.\r\n\r\nWhether the event has taken place, or not, as yet, is a matter I cannot\r\ndetermine, having received no information since upon the subject. But\r\nadmitting it has not, there is no room to doubt that they have all\r\nthings in a condition to do it, on the shortest notice, whenever they\r\nshall think the exigency of their affairs requires it. It is also\r\nequally certain, that they continue to carry on their fortifications\r\nfor the defence of New-York with the utmost industry and perseverance;\r\nand appear to be providing for the most obstinate resistance. Indeed,\r\nas their reduction would be attended with the most alarming and fatal\r\nconsequences to their nation, nothing else can be reasonably expected.\r\nThe moment I hear the troops have left Rhode Island, I will advise you.\r\n\r\nThe garrisons at Verplanck’s and Stony Points, still remain; but from\r\nthe concurring accounts of deserters, the heavy baggage and stores,\r\nexcept about eighteen or twenty rounds for each cannon, are embarked,\r\nand all matters are putting in train for an evacuation, in case\r\nevents make it necessary. The deserters add, as a circumstance of\r\nconfirmation, that Sir Henry Clinton was up at the posts about eight\r\ndays ago; and that, from that time, they have totally declined carrying\r\non any works.\r\n\r\nHaving given you the substance of the intelligence received since my\r\nlast, I am led (from the vast magnitude of the object which carried\r\nyou from head quarters, and the very interesting consequences it may\r\ninvolve, all of which I am persuaded will occur to your consideration)\r\nto remark, that the Count’s entering New-York Bay with his fleet,\r\nmust be the basis and groundwork of any co-operation that can be\r\nundertaken by us, either for the reduction of the enemy’s whole force,\r\nor the destruction of their shipping only. Every thing will absolutely\r\ndepend upon it, in either case; as, without it, and a free and open\r\ncommunication up and down the rivers, and in the Sound, which cannot\r\nbe effected and maintained in any other way, we could not possibly\r\nundertake any operations on Long Island, as our supplies of provisions\r\nand stores could only be obtained by water.\r\n\r\nThis point, I am certain, would have your due consideration; but it\r\nappearing to me the hinge, the one thing upon which all others must\r\nrest, I could not forbear mentioning it. The circumstance of the\r\nseason now, the expenditure of wood, and the necessity of supplying\r\nit, etc., will of course be fully attended to, according to their\r\nimportance: and I have only to add, from a desire of preventing a\r\nmisconception by either side, if any co-operation is agreed on, that\r\nthe terms and conditions may be explicitly understood. And whether it\r\nshall extend to an attempt to reduce the enemy’s whole force, or only\r\nto the destruction of their shipping; your engagements will provide\r\nfor the continuance of the Count’s fleet, to secure our retreat, and\r\nthe removal of our stores from Long and York Islands, if, unhappily,\r\nit should be found, on experiment, that neither is practicable, and we\r\nshould be obliged to abandon the enterprise.\r\n\r\n                                          I am, Gentlemen,\r\n                                          With great regard and respect,\r\n                                          Your most obedient servant,\r\n                                          G. Washington.\r\n\r\nP. S. 1-4 after three, P. M. Three deserters have just come in, who\r\nleft Verplanck’s Point last night. They all corroborate the accounts,\r\nby a detail of circumstances, of the preparations to evacuate both that\r\nand Stony Point. I have no doubt that things will at least be held in\r\nreadiness.\r\n\r\n                                                 G. Washington.\r\n\r\nAfter dispatching the above, I received a letter from Major-General\r\nHeath, of which the following is a copy.\r\n\r\n“I now have the pleasure to acquaint your Excellency, that the enemy\r\nhave left both Points, having burnt and destroyed their works.”\r\n\r\nGeneral Du Portail.\r\n\r\nColonel Hamilton.\r\n\r\n  Mandeville’s, Oct. 21, 1779. 4 o’clock, P. M.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY LEE TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      Monmouth, Oct. 22d, 1779.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir:\r\n\r\nI received your two letters announcing your object, route and wishes.\r\nI sent to you at Lewistown two pilots; one of them Captain Schuyler,\r\nfrom whom you may know more than from any other, as he was particularly\r\nactive.\r\n\r\nThe enemy’s strength at the Hook consists in two 64’s, the Europa and\r\nRussell; the Raisonable, Renown, Roebuck and Romulus.\r\n\r\nBesides these they have ten frigates and some armed schooners. They\r\nhave sunk ten hulks in the outer channel, and have more ready to be\r\nsunk; some of those sunk have got afloat and reached shore.\r\n\r\nThey have also two fire ships. My latest accounts from New-York,\r\nmention that all was attention and labor among the troops. Works are\r\nerecting on both sides the Narrows and on Governor’s Island. Head\r\nquarters in Long Island. Evacuation of Rhode Island not yet taken\r\nplace. A vessel got in on the 16th from Georgia, since whose arrival,\r\nthe two 64’s, and the Renown have fallen down to New-York.\r\n\r\nThe troops have embarked from the Hook and gone to the city.\r\n\r\nI construe these movements as indicatory of the Count’s withdrawal from\r\nthe coast. Do write me whenever you may hear certainly from the fleet.\r\nYou will regularly be informed of what passes here.\r\n\r\n                                                   I am, dear Sir,\r\n                                                   Yours affectionately,\r\n                                                   Henry Lee.\r\n\r\nCol. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMITCHELL TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Philadelphia, 23d October, 1779.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nYour favor of the 18th instant from Lewistown, came duly to hand, and\r\nin consequence of your request, expresses have been stationed at proper\r\ndistances on the road between this and Lewistown.\r\n\r\nYours of the 19th from Egg Harbor, came to hand at half-past two, and\r\nyours of the 22d instant, from Col. Westcoat’s, came to hand at three\r\no’clock this afternoon.\r\n\r\nI shall only observe in answer to your last note, which came unsealed,\r\nthat you have met with no delays from me, since your arrival in this\r\ncity from His Excellency’s head quarters, nor shall any delays or\r\nneglects be given you by the Department that I can prevent.\r\n\r\nYour letter to the President of Congress is delivered. I have shown\r\nhim yours to me. Congress is now sitting, but I shall wait till they\r\nrise in order that his dispatches may go with this conveyance; three\r\nexpresses set out with this to attend any orders you may have to\r\ndispatch. If you find more necessary, you shall have them. I had\r\nletters from His Excellency yesterday, but none for you or General\r\nPortail. This day letters came from Charleston, which mention that all\r\nthe British forces in Carolina and Georgia had got to Savannah, where\r\nthey were invested by the Count D’Estaing, and the American forces. He\r\nhad carried his approaches within four hundred yards of their works,\r\nand expected they would surrender in two or three days; the Experiment\r\ntaken, and several other ships and their naval force destroyed: but I\r\nexpect the President will give you a more particular account; those\r\naccounts are by private letters of good authority. Mr. Laurens was my\r\ninformant.\r\n\r\nI have sent you per the express, Mr. Trueman Kirk of O’Mooney, four\r\nhorses, the best I can procure in so short a time; one of them is a\r\nhorse you left here. It is with great difficulty horses can be procured\r\nsufficient to do the public business.\r\n\r\nThe President of Congress informs me he cannot write at present. The\r\naccounts from the southward are as late as the 4th instant, on which\r\nday the Count’s batteries were to open.\r\n\r\n                  I am with esteem and compl’ts to General Portail--Sir,\r\n                  Your most obed’t servant,\r\n                  Jno. Mitchell,\r\n                  _D. Q. Mst._\r\n\r\nA letter from His Excellency for you and Gen. Portail was sent to\r\nLewistown on the 19th inst., but suppose it will be returned; if so, no\r\ntime shall be lost in sending it.\r\n\r\nCol. Alexander Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON AND DU PORTAIL.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Head Quarters, West Point, October 25, 1779.\r\n\r\nGentlemen:\r\n\r\nI have just received a letter from Colonel Hamilton, mentioning your\r\nhaving changed your position, at Lewistown, for that of Little Egg\r\nHarbor; and that you would write me more fully on your arrival at the\r\nFurnace. In my last I informed you that the enemy had evacuated both\r\ntheir posts at King’s Ferry; since which, no alteration has taken place\r\nthat has come to my knowledge. Things at Rhode Island remain in the\r\nsame situation; at least I have received no accounts, either confirming\r\nor contradicting my former intelligence.\r\n\r\n                                        I am, Gentlemen, your most ob’t,\r\n                                        Humble servant,\r\n                                        G. Washington.\r\n\r\nGen. Du Portail.\r\n\r\nColonel Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDU PORTAIL AND HAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Great Egg Harbor Landing, October 26, 1779.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nWe are honored with two letters from your Excellency, of the 10th\r\nand 21st; to the contents of which we beg leave to assure you of our\r\nstrictest attention.\r\n\r\nThat of the 18th has not yet come to hand. It is not improbable, it has\r\ngone round by Lewistown, which has occasioned the delay.\r\n\r\nColonel Hamilton wrote to your Excellency from Philadelphia,\r\nacquainting you with our arrival there, and our intention to proceed\r\nto Lewistown, Cape Henlopen, and from Great Egg Harbor, communicating\r\nour progress since, and our determination to establish ourselves at\r\nBat Stove Furnace. We have since fixed on this place, about forty-four\r\nmiles from the extremity of Cape May (eighteen miles short of the\r\nFurnace, which we found to be more remote than had been represented),\r\nand, as far as we have been able to learn, from 100 to 110 miles of\r\nSandy Hook, and about 50 from Philadelphia. Your Excellency will easily\r\nperceive the reason of our choosing this station. It did not appear to\r\nus, from our inquiries in Philadelphia, to be a point well ascertained,\r\nthat the fleet would stop at the Delaware; and the time which had\r\nelapsed, made it more possible, if the Count should be determined to\r\nprosecute any further operations on the continent, that he would not\r\nlose time by a procedure of this sort, but might content himself with\r\nsending some transports, under escort of a few frigates, to receive the\r\nprovisions for the fleet, and proceed himself directly on to the Hook.\r\nOn this supposition, our position at Lewistown was entirely ineligible.\r\nThe distance at which we were from the city, as well as from the Hook;\r\nthe delays that would consequently attend our intelligence from every\r\nquarter; the difficulty and impossibility, sometimes, of traversing\r\nthe Bay, made our first situation inconvenient in every respect, in\r\nthe event of the fleet’s proceeding immediately to the Hook. These\r\nconsiderations induced us to cross the Delaware, and take the position\r\nat which we now are; where, or in the vicinity, we propose to remain\r\ntill the arrival of the Count; till intelligence from him decides the\r\ninutility of a longer stay; or till we receive your Excellency’s orders\r\nof recall.\r\n\r\nWe have now a better relation to the different points in which we\r\nare interested, and have taken the necessary precautions to gain the\r\nearliest notice of whatever happens. We have stationed expresses at\r\nthe pitch of the Cape, and have established a regular communication\r\nwith Major Lee, and with the city. If the fleet should appear off the\r\nDelaware, we can be there in twelve hours after its first appearance;\r\nand if at the Hook, in less than four days; provided Major Lee is\r\npunctual in conveying the intelligence, and the expresses, from either\r\nside, in bringing it.\r\n\r\nBy recent information from Philadelphia (though not quite so distinct\r\nand accurate as we could wish), we find, that so late as the fourth of\r\nthis month, the Count, as yet, was to open his batteries against the\r\nenemy at Savannah. The time that will probably intervene between this\r\nand the final reduction; the re-embarkation of the Count’s troops; the\r\ndispositions for sailing, and his arrival on this coast; may, we fear,\r\nexhaust the season too much to permit of the co-operation to which our\r\nmission relates.\r\n\r\nWe do not, however, despair; for if the Count has been fully\r\nsuccessful to the southward, and should shortly arrive (which may be\r\nthe case), the enterprise may possibly go on.\r\n\r\nIn a letter from Major Lee, of the 22d, he informs us, that a vessel\r\nfrom Georgia arrived on the 16th; since which the two sixty-fours, and\r\nthe Renown, which were at the Hook, had fallen down towards New-York;\r\nand the troops at the Hook had embarked and gone to the city. At first\r\nsight, this account alarmed us, and made us apprehensive that the enemy\r\nhad received some favorable advices from the southward, which put\r\nthem out of danger, and superseded the necessity of continuing their\r\npreparations for defence. But, on further reflection, we think it more\r\nprobable, that this is only a change of disposition; and that finding,\r\non closer examination, they would be unable to defend the Hook, they\r\nhad determined to relinquish the attempt.\r\n\r\nThis seems the more likely, as Major Lee mentions, that a part of the\r\nhulks, sunk in the channel, had gotten afloat and drifted ashore.\r\n\r\nTo this experience of the difficulty of obstructing the channel, may,\r\nperhaps, be attributed the change we suppose. And we are confirmed in\r\nthis conjecture, by the evacuation of the two posts at King’s Ferry,\r\nwhich appears, by your Excellency’s letter, to have taken place on the\r\n21st, five days after the supposed arrival of the vessel from Georgia;\r\na proof that they had not received information of any decisive good\r\nfortune on their side, or ill fortune on ours; and that they persisted\r\nin their defensive plan. We are persuaded, too, that their exultation\r\nwould have given wings to any good news they might have received,\r\nand that it would have reached us before this. Were the season less\r\nadvanced, we should regret this change of disposition; because we\r\nbelieve the attempt to defend the entrance of the Hook would have been\r\nfruitless; and it might have thrown a part of their ships, and of their\r\ntroops, into our hands, in the first instance, which could not fail to\r\nfacilitate the successive operations.\r\n\r\nBut, at this late period, it may rather be an advantage. To force the\r\npassage, might have required land operations against the Hook, which\r\nwould lose time and expose the fleet to the hazard of winds, which\r\nwould have rendered its situation critical. Now, the fleet may probably\r\nenter the bay, on its first approach, and be in security: and the whole\r\noperation will be brought to a point, and may demand less time for its\r\naccomplishment.\r\n\r\nAs a large number of fascines, ready for use, appear to us essential\r\nto any operations that may be undertaken, we presume your Excellency\r\nhas been preparing, and will continue to prepare as many as possible.\r\nWe beg leave to suggest the utility of having, at the same time, a\r\nsufficient number of gabions and sand bags. Of the former, Colonel\r\nGouvion, if your Excellency thinks proper, may be charged with\r\nthe constructing: the latter may be made under the care of the\r\nQuarter-Master at Philadelphia. Several thousands may be necessary. The\r\nusual dimensions are fifteen or eighteen inches long, and twelve wide.\r\nIf notwithstanding the advices from Major Lee, any thing by land is to\r\nbe attempted against the Hook, these will be peculiarly useful on such\r\na flat, sandy spot; and, indeed, it would be impracticable to construct\r\nbatteries, in any reasonable time, without them.\r\n\r\n                                             We have the honor to be,\r\n                                             Sir, your most obedient and\r\n                                             Humble servants,\r\n                                             A. Hamilton.\r\n                                             Du Portail.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency Gen. Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY LEE TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       October 29, 1779.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir:\r\n\r\nI have nothing new since my last; only a report aboard the Navy at the\r\nHook, purporting two naval actions, the one in the English Channel\r\nbetween the grand fleets: the second in the West Indies: in the former\r\nthe British were worsted; the Ardent, man-of-war, Admiral Gambier,\r\nsunk, and the fleet drove into two different ports where they were\r\nblocked up; in the latter the French were much damaged, and four of\r\ntheir capital ships taken.\r\n\r\nLt. Col. Simcoe has made lately a very extraordinary tour to\r\nMiddlebrook: he burnt the boats, magazine of forage, court-house,\r\nmeeting-house, took two officers at Mr. Vanhorn’s, and lost himself\r\nnear Brunswick. The party got safe to South Amboy. I send you a letter\r\nfrom head quarters.\r\n\r\n                                                   Adieu.\r\n                                                   Yours affectionately,\r\n                                                   Henry Lee.\r\n\r\nCol. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON AND DU PORTAIL.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Head Quarters, West Point, November 1, 1779.\r\n\r\nGentlemen:\r\n\r\nI have this day been favored with yours of twenty-sixth ult.,\r\ninforming me of your removal to Great Egg Harbor. My letter of the\r\neighteenth, which had not reached you, went, as you supposed, by way of\r\nPhiladelphia; and, lest any accident may have happened to it, I inclose\r\nyou a duplicate. Mine of the thirtieth ultimo, which went through Major\r\nLee, informed you of the evacuation of Rhode Island. I have since\r\nreceived a letter of the twenty-first ultimo, from my confidential\r\ncorrespondent in New-York. He informs me that Rawdon’s corps, the 57th,\r\nand some of the artillery, were then embarked: and it was said, and\r\ngenerally believed, that they were bound to Halifax. That the Robuste,\r\nof seventy-four guns, had arrived the twentieth, from Halifax; and that\r\na number of transports were taking in water and ballast. He gave me\r\nnothing further worth communicating.\r\n\r\nYou will find, by the letter of the 18th, that a provision of\r\nfascines and gabions was making; and I shall give directions to the\r\nQuarter-Master-General, to provide a quantity of sand bags.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to inform you, that Colonel La Rodiere died on Saturday\r\nlast. He is to be buried this day with the honors due to his rank.\r\n\r\n                                     I am, with great esteem, Gentlemen,\r\n                                     Your most obedient servant,\r\n                                     G. Washington.\r\n\r\nP. S. Upon a presumption that Colonel Laurens will be on board the\r\nfleet, the inclosed are sent to you.\r\n\r\nBrigadier-General Du Portail.\r\n\r\nColonel Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON TO DU PORTAIL AND HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Head Quarters, West Point, November 2, 1779.\r\n\r\nGentlemen:\r\n\r\nSince mine of yesterday, I have received another letter from my\r\nconfidential correspondent in New-York, dated the twenty-ninth ultimo.\r\nHe informs me, that the fifty-seventh regiment, Rawdon’s corps, and the\r\nartillery mentioned in his last, were to sail on that day for Halifax;\r\nand with them, all the heavy ships of war, except the Europa. The\r\nDaphne frigate, with Sir George Collier and Colonel Stewart on board,\r\nwas to sail for England the same day. He says the pilots reported, that\r\nit was now difficult to bring a vessel into the Hook, on account of\r\nthe hulks sunk there. (By this it would seem that some of them still\r\nremained upon the shoals.) He says the transports mentioned in his\r\nlast, as taking in water and ballast, only carried it down to the ships\r\nat the Hook. The Rainbow, of forty guns, had arrived from Halifax. He\r\ninforms me of no other circumstances that materially relate to affairs\r\nin New-York. He says a packet arrived from England on the twenty-third\r\nOctober. The accounts brought by her seemed to alarm the tories very\r\nmuch. It was reported that the Ardent, of sixty-four guns, had been\r\ntaken, and the English fleet chased into Portsmouth by the combined\r\nfleet, which remained off that place several days. He mentions these\r\nmatters as current reports, and adds, that a fleet of victuallers were\r\nto sail from Cork the latter end of September, and another of store\r\nships and merchantmen, from Spithead, about the same time.\r\n\r\n                                     I am, with great regard, Gentlemen,\r\n                                     Your most obedient servant,\r\n                                     G. Washington.\r\n\r\nThe capture of the Ardent is confirmed by a New-York paper of the\r\ntwentieth ultimo.\r\n\r\nGeneral Du Portail and Colonel Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDU PORTAIL TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                            Samedi Matin, 1779.\r\n\r\nMon Cher Colonel:\r\n\r\nJ’ai beaucoup revé depuis hier à l’affaire de Caroline, et je trouve\r\ntoujours dans ma tête les mêmes choses, la même façon de voir, les\r\nmêmes dispositions, que je vais vous expliquer en deux mots. Je serais\r\ncertainement bien aise d’aller en Caroline pendant cet hiver, mais je\r\nne voudrais pas absolument le demander, parce que, si je le demande, on\r\nne me saura plus de gré, que je n’irai pas avec le même agrément, que\r\nje ne pourrai faire aucune espèce d’arrangements qui me donne le moyen\r\nd’être vraiment utile là-bas, qu’il me vaudra voyager à mes dépens, ce\r\nque l’état de mes finances ne me permet pas, etc., etc. Je ne désire\r\ndonc y aller que dans le cas où le Congrès ayant par exemple assez\r\nbonne opinion de moi pour croire que dans le moment critique je puis\r\nêtre nécessaire dans le pays, il penserait de lui même ou averti par\r\nquelqu’un à m’y envoyer, ne pourriez vous donc pas mon cher Colonel,\r\nà propos de la demande du Géneral Washington au Congrès, observer,\r\n_comme de vous même_, au Géneral, que si je voulais aller passer mon\r\nhiver en Caroline cela serait peut-être fort avantageux. Si le\r\nGéneral le jugeait ainsi, probablement, il vous demanderait si vous\r\ncroyez que cela me convient d’ailleurs et me fait plaisir. Sur cela\r\nvous pourriez lui répondre que vous en êtes persuadé, et que je vous\r\nai fait entrevoir même que dans cette circonstance, je désirerais que\r\nle Géneral et le Congrès jugeassent à propos de m’envoyer dans le sud,\r\nmais pour le moment de crise seulement, souhaitant de revenir pour ses\r\nordres au commencement de la Congrès prochaine. Le Géneral prendrait\r\ndonc la résolution pour cela de me donner les ordres nécessaires,\r\nsi je n’ai besoin que des siens, ou s’il pense que le Congrès doit\r\nintervenir, d’expliquer au Congrès sa façon de penser à cet égard. Ceci\r\nsuffit à quelqu’un d’aussi intelligent que vous, pour négocier sous le\r\npied où je désire, ainsi je laisse le reste à faire à votre amitié. Que\r\ncette lettre d’ailleurs soit un secret entre nous, de quelque façon que\r\nl’affaire tourne; mais je désire absolument d’être gratifié en ceci.\r\nAdieu je vous attends à dîner et j’ai l’honneur d’être.\r\n\r\n                                            General Du Portail.\r\n\r\nCol. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO LAURENS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCold in my professions--warm in my friendships--I wish, my dear\r\nLaurens, it were in my power, by actions, rather than words, to\r\nconvince you that I love you. I shall only tell you, that till you bid\r\nus adieu, I hardly knew the value you had taught my heart to set upon\r\nyou. Indeed, my friend, it was not well done. You know the opinion I\r\nentertain of mankind; and how much it is my desire to preserve myself\r\nfree from particular attachments, and to keep my happiness independent\r\nof the caprices of others. You should not have taken advantage of my\r\nsensibility, to steal into my affections without my consent.\r\n\r\nBut as you have done it, and as we are generally indulgent to those\r\nwe love, I shall not scruple to pardon the fraud you have committed,\r\non one condition; that for my sake, if not for your own, you will\r\ncontinue to merit the partiality which you have so artfully instilled\r\ninto me. I have received your two letters: one from Philadelphia, the\r\nother from Chester. I am pleased with your success so far; and I hope\r\nthe favorable omens that precede your application to the Assembly,\r\nmay have as favorable an issue; provided the situation of affairs\r\nshould require it, which I fear will be the case. But, both for your\r\ncountry’s sake and for my own, I wish the enemy may be gone from\r\nGeorgia before you arrive; and that you may be obliged to return, and\r\nshare the fortunes of your old friends. In respect to the commission\r\nwhich you received from Congress, all the world must think your conduct\r\nperfectly right. Indeed, your ideas upon this occasion seem not to\r\nhave their wonted accuracy; and you have had scruples, in a great\r\nmeasure, without foundation. By your appointment as Aid-de-Camp to the\r\nCommander-in-Chief, you had as much the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nas any officer in the line. Your receiving a commission as\r\nLieutenant-Colonel, from the date of that appointment, does not, in\r\nthe least, injure or interfere with one of them; unless, by virtue of\r\nit, you are introduced into a particular regiment, in violation of the\r\nright of succession, which is not the case at present, neither is it\r\na necessary consequence. As you were going to command a battalion, it\r\nwas proper you should have a commission; and if this commission had\r\nbeen dated posterior to your appointment as Aid-de-Camp, I should have\r\nconsidered it derogatory to your former rank, to mine, and to that of\r\nthe whole corps. The only thing I see wrong in the affair is this:\r\nCongress, by their conduct, both on the former and present occasion,\r\nappear to have intended to confer a privilege, an honor, a mark of\r\ndistinction, a something upon you, which they withheld from other\r\ngentlemen of the family. This carries with it an air of preference,\r\nwhich, though we can all truly say we love your character and admire\r\nyour military merit, cannot fail to give some of us uneasy sensations.\r\nBut in this, my dear, I wish you to understand me well. The blame, if\r\nthere is any, falls wholly upon Congress. I repeat it, your conduct has\r\nbeen perfectly right, and even laudable. You rejected the offer when\r\nyou ought to have rejected it; and you accepted it when you ought to\r\nhave accepted it; and let me add, with a degree of over-scrupulous\r\ndelicacy. It was necessary to your project. Your project was the public\r\ngood; and I should have done the same. In hesitating, you have refined\r\non the refinements of generosity.\r\n\r\nThere is a total stagnation of news here. Gates has refused the Indian\r\ncommand. Sullivan is come to take it. The former has lately given a\r\nfresh proof of his impudence, his folly, and his *********. ’Tis no\r\ngreat matter; but a peculiarity in the case prevents my saying what.\r\n\r\nFleury shall be taken care of. All the family send love. In this, join\r\nthe General and Mrs. Washington; and what is best, it is not in the\r\nstyle of ceremony, but sincerity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAURENS TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Philadelphia, December 12, 1779.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Hamilton:\r\n\r\nUpon my arrival here yesterday evening, I communicated the intelligence\r\nreceived from General Wayne, to the President of Congress and the\r\nFrench minister. The latter surprised me greatly, by informing me,\r\nthat only one 74 gun ship of the Count De Grasse’s division, and\r\nthe Fier Rodrigue, had arrived at Chesapeake. I am at a loss how to\r\naccount for the absence of the rest. They have not been within the\r\nreach of a superior enemy’s force: no storm has happened, within\r\nour knowledge, to drive them to any considerable distance from the\r\ncoast. It cannot rationally be supposed that the Count has received\r\ncountermanding orders, and that a capital ship of the line, together\r\nwith a very valuable warlike merchantman, is to be sacrificed. Be the\r\ncase as it may, all hopes of passing our reinforcement for the southern\r\ndepartment, by sea, are out of the question. The North Carolina\r\nBrigade, after profiting by the navigation of the Delaware as far as\r\nit would serve them, marched to the head of Elk. Thence they proceed,\r\nby water, across the Chesapeake, and up to Petersburgh, where they are\r\nto be overtaken by their wagons, and pursue the rest of their way by\r\nthe middle road to Charleston. This is the route marked by the Board\r\nof War, and a Committee of Congress appointed to confer with them;\r\nand I believe it was recommended by Doctor Burke, one of the North\r\nCarolina delegates lately from that country. It is intended that the\r\nVirginians should pursue the same as far as Petersburgh, where they\r\nare to take an upper road. In this route we do not avail ourselves of\r\nAlbemarle Sound. The going up the river to Petersburgh will certainly\r\nbe tedious; and four hundred miles land march is to be executed from\r\nthence. I communicated these objections to Mr. Matthews, and proposed\r\nthe route which the General pointed out; but the poverty of the country\r\nin provision, and the means of transporting the baggage of the troops,\r\nhe said, would outweigh the advantages of the water carriage and\r\ndirect road. I am by no means satisfied with the present arrangement,\r\nwhen I reflect how much more rapidly the British may convey their\r\nreinforcements: but all the inquiries I have made hitherto, have\r\nproduced nothing favorable to our plan. Indeed, in the present\r\nunguarded state of the Chesapeake, the British might render the passage\r\neven of that ineligible.\r\n\r\nMr. Serle, a member of Congress, who arrived in town last night from\r\nthe neighborhood of Major Leigh’s post, asserts, that no transports\r\nwere at the Hook on Wednesday. Whether the British operations are\r\ndelayed by false rumors of Count De Grasse’s division; or whether\r\nthey have heard, as we have here, that Count D’Estaing was still\r\non the coast the twentieth of November, I cannot decide: but one\r\nwould be inclined to think, that they are disconcerted, either by\r\nfalse intelligence, or a total defect of it. I entreat you, my dear\r\nfriend, to transmit me the earliest and most accurate relation that\r\ncan be obtained, of the British movements; and enlighten me with your\r\nobservations upon them. Present my respects and love to our excellent\r\nGeneral and the family. May you enjoy all the pleasure, moral and\r\nphysical, which you promise yourself in winter quarters, and be as\r\nhappy as you deserve. Tell the Doctor I shall commit his darling to\r\nthe press this morning.\r\n\r\n                                                  Yours, ever,\r\n                                                  John Laurens.\r\n\r\nColonel Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAURENS TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Philadelphia, December 18, 1779.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Hamilton:\r\n\r\nOn my arrival in town, I was informed by the President, that Congress\r\nhad suspended the business of appointing a secretary to their minister\r\nplenipotentiary at Versailles, until my return, in hopes that I might\r\nstill be prevailed upon to accept the office. I replied, that I thought\r\nmy letter upon the subject sufficiently explicit; and assured him of\r\nmy sincere desire to be excused from serving in that capacity at the\r\npresent juncture of our affairs.\r\n\r\nHe urged the unanimity of the choice with respect to me; the difficulty\r\nof uniting the suffrages of all parties, in case of a new nomination;\r\nand the advantages of this union. Several delegates of Congress\r\ndeclared to me the embarrassment of Congress since I had declined. One,\r\nin particular, suggested to me his apprehension of interest being made\r\nfor a late delegate of New-York, who is candidate for the office, and\r\nto whom the world, in general, allows greater credit for his abilities\r\nthan his integrity; and said, “he was determined to oppose him with\r\nall his influence.” When I quitted town the sixteenth, these matters\r\ncrowded into my mind. I fell into a train of serious reflections and\r\nself-examination; endeavored to investigate whether I had acted\r\nconsonantly to the καλον και αγαθον, and fulfilled the duties of a good\r\ncitizen in this transaction. In fine, I agitated the grand question,\r\nWhether a citizen has a right to decline any office to which his\r\ncountrymen appoint him; upon what that right is founded; and whether it\r\nexisted in my case.\r\n\r\nAfter undergoing the severest conflict that ever I experienced;\r\nsometimes reproaching, sometimes justifying myself; pursuing my\r\njourney, or turning retrograde; as the arguments on the one side or the\r\nother appeared to prevail; I determined that I had been deficient in\r\nthe duties of a good citizen. I returned to Philadelphia; communicated\r\nmy sentiments to the President and two other members; and declared\r\nto them, that I thought it incumbent on me, in the first place, to\r\nrecommend a person equally qualified in point of integrity, and much\r\nbetter in point of ability. That if, unhappily, they could not agree\r\nupon Colonel Hamilton, and that I was absolutely necessary to exclude\r\na dangerous person, or to prevent pernicious delays, I should think it\r\nmy duty to obey the orders of Congress. The persons now in nomination,\r\nare, Colonel Hamilton, Mr. Lovell, Mr. G. Morris, Major Stewart. I am\r\nsorry that you are not better known to Congress. Great stress is laid\r\nupon the probity and patriotism of the person to be employed in this\r\ncommission. I have given my testimony of you in this, and the other\r\nequally essential points.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to inform you, that the North Carolina brigade had not\r\nquitted Elk the sixteenth; having been detained by the ice.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to write you, just as I am on the wing. Be so good as to\r\nthank Tilghman for his letter. Inform him, from Mr. Mitchell, that his\r\nhabiliments are making.\r\n\r\n                                                My love as usual. Adieu.\r\n                                                John Laurens.\r\n\r\nColonel Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAURENS TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                              Charleston, 1779.\r\n\r\nTernant will relate to you how many violent struggles I have had\r\nbetween duty and inclination--how much my heart was with you, while I\r\nappeared to be most actively employed here. But it appears to me that I\r\nshould be inexcusable in the light of a citizen, if I did not continue\r\nmy utmost efforts for carrying the plan of the black levies into\r\nexecution, while there remains the smallest hopes of success.\r\n\r\nOur army is reduced to nothing almost, by the departure of the\r\nVirginians. Scott’s arrival will scarcely restore us to our ancient\r\nnumber. If the enemy destine the reinforcements from Great Britain\r\nto this quarter, as in policy they ought to do, that number will be\r\ninsufficient for the security of our country. The Governor, among other\r\nmatters to be laid before the House of Assembly, intends to propose the\r\ncompleting our continental battalions by drafts from the militia. This\r\nmeasure, I am told, is so unpopular that there is no hope of succeeding\r\nin it. Either this must be adopted, or the black levies, or the State\r\nwill fall a victim to the improvidence of its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives have had a longer recess than usual,\r\noccasioned by the number of members in the field. It will be convened,\r\nhowever, in a few days. I intend to qualify, and make a final effort.\r\nOh that I were a Demosthenes! The Athenians never deserved a more\r\nbitter exprobation than our countrymen.\r\n\r\nGeneral Clinton’s movements, and your march in consequence, made me\r\nwish to be with you. If any thing important should be done in your\r\nquarter, while I am doing daily penance here, and making useless\r\nharangues, I shall execrate my stars, and be out of humor with\r\nthe world. I entreat you, my dear friend, write me as freely as\r\ncircumstances will permit, and enlighten me upon what is going forward.\r\n\r\nAdieu. My love to our colleagues. I am afraid I was so thoughtless as\r\nto omit my remembrances to Gibbs. Tell him that I am always his sincere\r\nwell-wisher, and hope to laugh with him again ere long.\r\n\r\n                                                Adieu again. Yours ever,\r\n                                                John Laurens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO ROBERT MORRIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nThe present conjuncture is by all allowed to be peculiarly critical.\r\nEvery man of reflection employs his thoughts about the remedies\r\nproper to be applied to the national disorders; and every one,\r\nfrom a partiality to his own ideas, wishes to convey them to those\r\nwho are charged with the management of affairs. The channel of the\r\npublic papers, commonly made use of for the purpose, appears to me\r\nexceptionable on several accounts. It not only restrains a freedom\r\nof discussion, from the extreme delicacy of the subject; but the\r\ndiscussion itself increases the evil, by exposing our weak sides\r\nto the popular eye, and adding false terrors to those well-founded\r\napprehensions which our situation authorizes.\r\n\r\nInstead of pursuing this method, I prefer addressing myself to a member\r\nof that body, in whose power alone it is, by well-digested system, to\r\nextricate us from our embarrassments. I have pitched upon you, from a\r\npersonal knowledge of your abilities and zeal. If I offer any thing new\r\nand useful, I am persuaded you will endeavor to turn it to advantage.\r\nIf the contrary is the case, I am, at least, doing no harm. I shall\r\nonly have had the trouble of writing, and you of reading, a few useless\r\npages.\r\n\r\nThe object of principal concern is the state of our currency. In\r\nmy opinion, all our speculations on this head have been founded in\r\nerror. Most people think, that the depreciation might have been\r\navoided, by provident arrangements in the beginning, without any aid\r\nfrom abroad: and a great many of our sanguine politicians, till very\r\nlately, imagined the money might still be restored by expedients within\r\nourselves. Hence the delay in attempting to procure a foreign loan.\r\n\r\nThis idea proceeded from an ignorance of the real extent of our\r\nresources. The war, particularly in the first periods, required\r\nexertions beyond our strength, to which neither our population nor\r\nriches were equal. We have the fullest proof of this, in the constant\r\nthinness of our armies; the impossibility, at this time, of recruiting\r\nthem otherwise than by compulsion; the scarcity of hands in husbandry,\r\nand other occupations; the decrease of our staple commodities; and the\r\ndifficulty of every species of supply. I am aware that the badness of\r\nthe money has its influence; but it was originally an effect, not a\r\ncause, though it now partakes of the nature of both. A part of those\r\nevils would appear, were our finances in a more flourishing condition.\r\nWe experienced them before the money was materially depreciated; and\r\nthey contributed to its depreciation. The want of men soon obliged\r\nthe public to pay extravagant wages for them in every department.\r\nAgriculture languished from a defect of hands. The mechanic arts did\r\nthe same. The price of every kind of labor increased: and the articles\r\nof foreign commerce, from the interruption it received, more than kept\r\npace with other things.\r\n\r\nThe relative value of money being determined by the greater or less\r\nportion of labor and commodities which it will purchase; whatever these\r\ngained in price, that of course lost in value.\r\n\r\nThe public expenditures, from the dearness of every thing, necessarily\r\nbecame immense; greater in proportion than in other countries; and much\r\nbeyond any revenues which the best concerted scheme of finance could\r\nhave extracted from the natural funds of the State. No taxes, which\r\nthe people were capable of bearing, on that quantity of money which\r\nis deemed a proper medium for this country (had it been gold instead\r\nof paper), would have been sufficient for the current exigencies of\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe most opulent States of Europe, in a war of any duration, are\r\ncommonly obliged to have recourse to foreign loans or subsidies.[3]\r\nHow, then, could we expect to do without them, and not augment the\r\nquantity of our artificial wealth beyond those bounds which were proper\r\nto preserve its credit? The idea was chimerical.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of money formerly in circulation among us, is estimated\r\nat about thirty millions of dollars. This was barely sufficient for\r\nour interior commerce. Our exterior commerce was chiefly carried on\r\nby barter. We sent our commodities abroad, and brought back others\r\nin return. The balance of the principal branch was against us; and\r\nthe little _specie_ derived from others, was transferred directly to\r\nthe payment of that balance, without passing into home circulation.\r\nIt would have been impracticable, by loans and taxes, to bring such\r\na portion of the forementioned sum into the public coffers as would\r\nhave answered the purposes of the war: nor could it have spared so\r\nconsiderable a part, without obstructing the operations of domestic\r\ncommerce. Taxes are limited, not only by the quantity of wealth in a\r\nState, but by the temper, habits, and genius of the people; all which,\r\nin this country, conspired to render them moderate: and as to loans,\r\nmen will not be prevailed upon to lend money to the public when there\r\nis a scarcity, and they can find a more profitable way of employing it\r\notherwise, as was our case.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary revenues of the United Provinces amount to about\r\ntwenty-five millions of guilders; or two millions two hundred and\r\nfifty thousand pounds sterling per annum. This is, in proportion to\r\nits territory and numbers, the richest country in the world; and\r\nthe country where the people sustain the heaviest load of taxes.\r\nIts population is about equal to ours, two millions of souls. The\r\nburthens on the subject are so great, that it is by some held almost\r\nimpracticable, even on extraordinary emergencies, to enlarge the\r\nrevenues by new impositions. It is maintained, their dependence, in\r\nthese cases, must be on the extraordinary contributions of wealthy\r\nindividuals; with the aid of which, in some of their wars, they have\r\nraised four millions sterling a year. In a country possessed of so\r\nvast a stock of wealth, where taxes are carried to such a height;\r\nand where the means of paying them so infinitely exceed those in our\r\npower; if the national revenues only amount to the sum I have stated,\r\nhow inadequate must have been the product of any taxes we could have\r\nlevied, to the demands of the service! Loans, for the reason before\r\nhinted, would have been out of the question; at least, they would have\r\nbeen so trifling as to be an object of little importance. Suppose we\r\nshould have been able to raise a million sterling, annually; a sum\r\nthat probably would have exceeded our ability; how unequal would this\r\nhave been to our wants![4] No economy could have made it bear any\r\nproportion, especially if we recur to the causes already enumerated, by\r\nwhich the currency depreciated in its first stages.\r\n\r\nFrom these reasonings it results, that it was not in the power of\r\nCongress, when their emissions had arrived at the thirty millions of\r\ndollars, to put a stop to them.[5] They were obliged, in order to\r\nkeep up the supplies, to go on creating artificial revenues by new\r\nemissions; and as these multiplied, their value declined. The progress\r\nof the depreciation might have been retarded, but it could not have\r\nbeen prevented. It was, in a great degree, necessary.\r\n\r\nThere was but one remedy; a foreign loan. All other expedients should\r\nrather have been considered as auxiliary. Could a loan have been\r\nobtained, and judiciously applied, assisted by a vigorous system of\r\ntaxation, we might have avoided that excess of emissions which has\r\nruined the paper. The credit of such a fund would have procured loans\r\nfrom the moneyed and trading men within ourselves; because it might\r\nhave been so directed, as to have been beneficial to them in their\r\ncommercial transactions abroad.[6]\r\n\r\nThe necessity for a foreign loan is now greater than ever. Nothing else\r\nwill retrieve our affairs.\r\n\r\nThe wheels of Government, without it, cannot much longer be kept in\r\nmotion. Including Loan-office certificates, and State emissions,\r\nwe have about four hundred millions of dollars in circulation. The\r\nreal value of these, is less than seven millions, which is the true\r\ncirculating medium of these States: for though the price of specie is\r\n      and the rate of exchange for sterling bills      the nominal value\r\nof every commodity is at least sixty to one, on an average. All the\r\nreasonings against the possibility of raising the current expenses\r\non the foundation of thirty millions, apply to our present situation\r\nin the ratio of thirty to seven; that is, it is as thirty to seven\r\nless practicable now than when our emissions amounted to only thirty\r\nmillions. Could every dollar in circulation be brought annually\r\ninto the treasury, which never was effected in any country, and is\r\npolitically impossible, the revenue would not be equal to the yearly\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\nThe hope of appreciating the money, by taxes and domestic loans, is\r\nat an end. As fast as it could be received, it must be issued in the\r\ndaily expenditures. The momentary interval between its being drawn out\r\nof circulation and returning into it, would prevent its receiving the\r\nleast advantage.\r\n\r\nThese reasonings may appear useless, as the necessity of a foreign\r\nloan is now acknowledged, and measures are taking to procure it. But\r\nthey are intended to establish good principles; the want of which has\r\nbrought us to the desperate crisis we are arrived at, and may still\r\nbetray us into fatal mistakes.\r\n\r\nHow this loan is to be employed, is now the question; and its\r\ndifficulty equal to its importance! Two plans have been proposed: one,\r\nto purchase up at once, in specie, or sterling bills, all superfluous\r\npaper; and to endeavor, by taxes, loans, and economy, to hinder its\r\nreturning into circulation. The remainder, it is supposed, would then\r\nrecover its value. This, it is said, will reduce our public debt to the\r\nsterling cost of the paper.\r\n\r\nSuppose two hundred millions were to be purchased, and the rest called\r\nin by taxes. At       this would require bills to the amount\r\nof       of dollars. But I doubt whether four times this sum would be\r\nsufficient. The moment it was known such purchases were to be made,\r\nthe avarice of the speculators would begin to operate: the demand\r\nwould immediately occasion an artificial appreciation; each successive\r\nmillion would cost more than the preceding. But this appreciation\r\nwould be more relative to the purchasing medium than to the prices\r\nof commodities. The raising the value of the paper relative to the\r\nformer, would depend on the combination of a few artful individuals,\r\nand would be easily accomplished. The diminution of prices must be\r\nslow, as it implies a change in the sentiments of the body of the\r\npeople with respect to the money. A sudden revolution in the general\r\nrates of all the necessaries of life is not to be expected. The prices\r\nof these, as they have reached their present summit by degrees, must,\r\nby degrees, revert to their former station. The minds of the people\r\nwill not readily admit impressions in favor of the currency. All their\r\npast experience has given a habit of diffidence; and the epidemical\r\nspirit of extortion will maintain a violent struggle with whatever has\r\na tendency to produce a fall of prices. A permanent reduction of the\r\nquantity of circulating cash, will alone gradually effect it. But this\r\nwill not happen on the present plan.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of continuing the supplies at nearly the same rates now\r\ngiven (which would be the case if my reasonings are true), would have\r\nnearly the same effect mentioned with respect to taxes and domestic\r\nloans. The money would return into circulation almost as fast as it\r\nwas drawn out: and at the end of the year we should find our treasury\r\nempty; our foreign loan dissipated; and the state of our finances\r\nas deplorable as ever. At a moderate calculation, we should have\r\nspent ten or twelve millions of real dollars, for the sole purpose of\r\ncarrying on the war another year. It would be much better, instead\r\nof purchasing up the paper currency, to purchase the supplies out of\r\nour specie or bills. In the first instance, the public would suffer a\r\ndirect loss of the artificial appreciation, relative to the purchasing\r\nmedium: in the last, it would buy at the value of the commodities in\r\nspecie or bills.\r\n\r\nA great source of error in disquisitions of this nature, is the judging\r\nof events by abstract calculations; which, though geometrically true,\r\nare false as they relate to the concerns of beings governed more by\r\npassion and prejudice, than by an enlightened sense of their interests.\r\nA degree of illusion mixes itself in all the affairs of society. The\r\nopinion of objects has more influence than their real nature. The\r\nquantity of money in circulation is certainly a chief cause of its\r\ndecline: but we find it is depreciated more than five times as much as\r\nit ought to be by this rule. The excess is derived from opinion; a want\r\nof confidence. In like manner we deceive ourselves, when we suppose the\r\nvalue will increase in proportion as the quantity is lessened. Opinion\r\nwill operate here also; and a thousand circumstances may promote or\r\ncounteract the principle.\r\n\r\nThe other plan proposed, is to convert the loan into merchandise, and\r\nimport it on public account. This plan is incomparably better than\r\nthe former. Instead of losing on the sale of its specie or bills, the\r\npublic would gain a considerable profit on the commodities imported.\r\nThe loan would go much further this way, in supplying the expenses\r\nof the war; and a large stock of valuable commodities, useful to the\r\narmy and to the country, would be introduced. This would affect the\r\nprices of things in general, and assist the currency. But the arts\r\nof monopolizers would prevent its having so extensive and durable an\r\ninfluence as it ought to have.\r\n\r\nA great impediment to the success of this, as well as the former\r\nscheme, will be the vast sums requisite for the current expenses. The\r\narguments adduced in the former case are applicable here also, though\r\nnot with equal force. The necessity the public will be under of\r\nparting with its stock to defray the daily demands, will give designing\r\nmen an opportunity, by combinations not to purchase, to oblige it to\r\nsell at a rate below the real value of money. This they may the more\r\neasily effect, as the demand for foreign commodities is much less than\r\nformerly, on account of the general spirit of parsimony which has\r\nobtained from necessity, and the manufactures carried on in private\r\nfamilies for their own use. The greatest part of the country people now\r\nalmost entirely clothe themselves.\r\n\r\nThe public must either sell very cheap, to collect rapidly the\r\nsuperfluous paper in hopes of raising the value of the remainder; or\r\nit must sell very slow, to preserve the due proportion between the\r\narticles it has for sale and those it wants to buy. By pursuing the\r\nfirst method, it will soon exhaust its stock at a very considerable\r\nloss, and only give temporary relief to the currency. According to\r\nmy principle, though it sells cheap, it must still buy dear; and,\r\nconsequently, the money collected cannot remain in the treasury long\r\nenough to preserve the rise in its appreciated state. If it pursues the\r\nsecond method, the expenditures will be equal to the income; and though\r\nthe public will make the natural profits on its goods, as it will lay\r\nup nothing, it will do nothing towards the appreciation.[7]\r\n\r\nThe farmers have the game in their own hands, and will make it very\r\ndifficult to lower the prices of their commodities. For want of\r\nlaborers, there is no great superfluity of the most essential articles\r\nraised. These are things of absolute necessity, and must be purchased,\r\nas well by the other classes of society as by the public. The farmers,\r\non the contrary, if they do not like the price, are not obliged to\r\nsell; because they have almost every necessary within themselves; salt,\r\nand one or two more, excepted; which bear a small proportion to what\r\nis wanted from them; and which they can obtain, by barter, for other\r\narticles equally indispensable. Heavy taxes, it may be said, will\r\noblige them to sell; but they can pay, with a small part of what they\r\nhave, any taxes our legislatures will venture to impose, or would be\r\nable to enforce.\r\n\r\nOne measure, alone, can counterbalance these advantages of the farmers,\r\nand oblige them to contribute their proper quota to the support of\r\nGovernment: a tax in kind.\r\n\r\nThis ought instantly to begin throughout the States. The present\r\nquantity of cash, though nominally enormous, would, in reality, be\r\nfound incompetent to domestic circulation, were it not that a great\r\npart of our internal commerce is carried on by barter. For this reason,\r\nit is impossible, by pecuniary taxes, to raise a sum proportioned\r\nto the wants of the State. The money is no longer a general\r\nrepresentative; and when it ceases to be so, the State ought to call\r\nfor a portion of the thing represented; or, in other words, to tax in\r\nkind. This will greatly facilitate whatever plan of finance is adopted;\r\nbecause it will lessen the expenditures in cash, and make it the easier\r\nto retain what is drawn in.\r\n\r\nI said the demand for foreign goods is less than it formerly was. I\r\nmean there is not a demand for so large a quantity, which the reasons\r\nalready assigned clearly demonstrate; nor are the exorbitant rates now\r\ngiven any objection to this doctrine. There is an absolute scarcity\r\neven in comparison of the present consumption; and, of course, a demand\r\nfor what there is. But should an importation of two millions sterling\r\ntake place, the market would be glutted; and there would be no way of\r\nkeeping up the price, but by making very slow sales. A less quantity\r\nwould stand no chance of calling in the money, and keeping it in long\r\nenough to effect any thing in favor of its credit.\r\n\r\nI say nothing about the risk of importation. I do not believe we could\r\nobtain a convoy sufficient to justify our hazarding it without the\r\nprecaution of insurance. But with this expedient we are safe; and must\r\nbe satisfied with smaller profits for the sake of security.\r\n\r\nThis is a plan not altogether to be rejected. With prudent management\r\nit might enable us to carry on the war two or three years (which,\r\nperhaps, is as long as it may last); but if we should expect more from\r\nit, the restoration of the currency, we should be disappointed.\r\n\r\nThe only plan that can preserve the currency, is one that will make\r\nit the _immediate_ interest of the moneyed men to co-operate with\r\nGovernment in its support. This country is in the same predicament in\r\nwhich France was previous to the famous Mississippi scheme, projected\r\nby Mr. Law. Its paper money, like ours, had dwindled to nothing; and no\r\nefforts of the Government could revive it, because the people had lost\r\nall confidence in its ability. Mr. Law, who had much more penetration\r\nthan integrity, readily perceived, that no plan could succeed which\r\ndid not unite the interest and credit of rich individuals with those\r\nof the State; and upon this, he framed the idea of his project, which,\r\nso far, agreed in principle with the Bank of England. The foundation\r\nwas good, but the superstructure too vast. The proprietors aimed at\r\nunlimited wealth, and the Government itself expected too much; which\r\nwas the cause of the ultimate miscarriage of the scheme, and of all the\r\nmischiefs that befel the kingdom in consequence.\r\n\r\nIt will be our wisdom to select what is good in this plan, and in any\r\nothers that have gone before us; avoiding their defects and excesses.\r\nSomething on a similar principle in America, will alone accomplish the\r\nrestoration of paper credit, and establish a permanent fund for the\r\nfuture exigencies of Government.\r\n\r\nArticle I. The plan I would propose, is that of an American Bank,\r\ninstituted by authority of Congress for ten years, under the\r\ndenomination of The Bank of the United States. II. A foreign loan\r\nmakes a necessary part of the plan; but this I am persuaded we can\r\nobtain, if we pursue the proper measures. I shall suppose it to amount\r\nto two millions of pounds sterling. This loan to be thrown into the\r\nBank as a part of its stock.\r\n\r\nIII. A subscription to be opened for two hundred millions of dollars;\r\nand the subscribers erected into a Company, to be called The\r\nCompany of the Bank of the United States.\r\n\r\nIV. The Government to guarantee this subscription money to the\r\nproprietors, at the rate of one for twenty; that is, to engage, at the\r\ndissolution of the Bank, to make good to them the sum of ten millions\r\nof dollars, in lieu of the two hundred millions subscribed, payable in\r\nSpanish milled dollars, or a currency bona fide equivalent to them.\r\n\r\nV. The taxes raised in money annually, to be thrown into stock.[8]\r\n\r\nVI. All the remaining paper to be called in (at the option of the\r\npossessor), and bank notes issued in lieu of them, for so much\r\nsterling, payable to the bearer in three months from the date, at two\r\nper cent. per annum interest. A pound sterling to be estimated at\r\ntwo hundred and sixty-six and two-thirds of the present dollars.[9]\r\nThe interest to be punctually paid in specie at the end of the three\r\nmonths; when it shall be at the choice of the possessor to have the\r\nbank notes renewed, or to receive the sum deposited, in the old paper.\r\n\r\nVII. All the money issued from the Bank, to be of the same\r\ndenomination, and on the same terms.[10] VIII. The Bank to furnish\r\nCongress with an annual loan of two millions sterling, if they have\r\noccasion for it, at four per cent. interest.\r\n\r\nIX. The whole, or such part of the stock as is judged necessary, to be\r\nemployed in commerce, in the manner, and on the terms, which shall be\r\nagreed upon, from time to time, between the Company, and a Board of\r\nTrade to be appointed by Congress.\r\n\r\nX. The Bank to issue occasionally, by permission of Congress, such\r\nsums as may be thought safe and expedient, in private loans, on good\r\nsecurities, at six per cent. interest.\r\n\r\nXI. The Government to share half the whole stock and profits of the\r\nBank.\r\n\r\nXII. The Bank to be managed by the trustees of the Company, under the\r\ninspection of the Board of Trade,[11] who may have recourse to the\r\nCompany books whenever they think proper, to examine the state of its\r\naffairs. The same is done in England, and in other countries where\r\nBanks are established, and is a privilege which the Government has a\r\nright to demand for its own security. It is the more necessary in this\r\ncase, from the commercial nature of the Bank.\r\n\r\nTo give an idea of the advantages\r\n\r\n [Here a part of the manuscript is missing.]\r\n\r\nwhich, having all the operation of money, and of a more advantageous\r\nkind than that which the lenders have parted with, will have all the\r\nefficacy of a payment. It is for this reason they are made to bear\r\ninterest: and there can be no doubt, that every man will prefer a\r\nspecies of money which answers all the purposes of a currency, and\r\neven, when lying idle, brings in a profit to the possessor. The same\r\nconsideration will prevent the lenders recalling the old paper, at the\r\nquarterly payments; because they hold a more valuable property instead\r\nof it. The interest is to be paid in specie, as a further temptation,\r\nfor which a small sum will suffice. The denomination of the money is\r\naltered; because it will produce a useful illusion. Mankind are much\r\nled by sounds and appearances; and the currency having changed its\r\nname, will seem to have changed its nature.\r\n\r\nThe Bank will advance bills to the amount of two millions of pounds\r\nsterling to Congress; and, in addition to its stock, will now have a\r\ndebt due it of this sum, which is to be considered as so much gained.\r\n\r\n [Here a part of the manuscript is missing.]\r\n\r\n Brought over,                                              7,075,000\r\n To be deducted,\r\n Drawn out of circulation, by the sale\r\n   of goods imported,                            4,000,000\r\n By governmental taxes, supposed to be,          1,000,000--5,000,000\r\n                                                            ---------\r\n Remaining in circulation the fourth year,                 £2,075,000\r\n\r\nThis will be less than the preceding, which is occasioned by the\r\nmillion supposed to be drawn in by taxes.\r\n\r\nThe national debt, on this plan, will stand thus, at the end of three\r\nyears:\r\n\r\n Foreign loan,                                 2,000,000\r\n Domestic loan, at two millions per annum,     6,000,000\r\n Interest, at four per cent.,                    320,000\r\n                                               ---------\r\n                                               8,320,000\r\n Half the value of the Bank,                   7,900,000\r\n                                               ---------\r\n Balance against the United States,             £420,000\r\n\r\nWe may, therefore, by means of this establishment, carry on the war\r\nthree years, and only incur a debt of four hundred and twenty thousand\r\npounds over and above the guarantee of the subscription money; which,\r\nhowever, is not to be paid till the end of ten years.\r\n\r\nI have said, in one place, that abstract calculations, in questions\r\nof finance, are not to be relied on: and as the complex operations of\r\ntrade are involved in the present plan, I am, myself, diffident of\r\nthose flattering results which it presents at every step. I am aware\r\nhow apt the imagination is to be heated in projects of this nature,\r\nand to overlook the fallacies which often lurk in first principles.\r\nBut when I consider, on the other hand, that the scheme stands on the\r\nfirm footing of public and private faith; that it links the interest of\r\nthe State in an intimate connection with those of the rich individuals\r\nbelonging to it; that it turns the wealth and influence of both into a\r\ncommercial channel, for mutual benefit, which must afford advantages\r\nnot to be estimated; that there is a defect of circulating medium,\r\nwhich this plan supplies, by a sort of creative power; converting what\r\nis so produced into a real and efficacious instrument of trade; I\r\nsay, when I consider these things, and many more that might be added,\r\nI cannot forbear feeling a degree of confidence in the plan; and, at\r\nleast, hoping that it is capable of being improved into something that\r\nwill give relief to our finances.\r\n\r\nI do not believe, that the advantages will be so great in fact, as\r\nthey seem to be in speculation. They will be limited by the means of\r\ncommerce which the States produce; and these may not be so extensive\r\nin the beginning as the plan supposes. Beside this, the profits of\r\nthe commerce will not be so large, in proportion, after the first or\r\nsecond year, as during those years: neither will it be possible to\r\nincrease the paper credit in the same degree. But the Bank of England\r\nis a striking example, how far this may be carried, when supported by\r\npublic authority and private influence. On the other hand, a variety of\r\nsecondary expedients may be invented, to enlarge the advantages of the\r\nbank. The whole system of annuities, as practised in England, may be\r\ningrafted upon it, with such differences as are proper to accommodate\r\nit to our circumstances. The European loan may also be converted into\r\na European Bank, the interests of which, being interwoven with the\r\nAmerican Bank, may engage rich individuals there in promoting and\r\nextending the plan.\r\n\r\nVery beneficial contracts may be made between Government and the\r\nCompany, for supplying the army, by which money may be saved to the\r\npublic, the army better furnished, and the profits of the bank extended.\r\n\r\nI have confined the Bank to the space of ten years; because this will\r\nbe long enough to judge of its advantages and disadvantages: and the\r\nlatter may be rectified by giving it a new form. I do not suppose it\r\nwill ever be discontinued; because it seems to be founded on principles\r\nthat must always operate well, and make it the interest, both of\r\nGovernment and the Company, to uphold it. But I suppose the plan\r\ncapable of improvement, which experience will suggest.\r\n\r\nI give one half of the whole property of the Bank to the United States;\r\nbecause it is not only just, but desirable to both parties. The United\r\nStates contribute a great part of the stock; their authority is\r\nessential to the existence of the Bank; their credit is pledged for\r\nits support. The plan would ultimately fail, if the terms were too\r\nfavorable to the Company, and too hard upon Government. It might be\r\nencumbered with a debt which it could never pay, and be obliged to take\r\nrefuge in a bankruptcy. The share which the State has in the profits,\r\nwill induce it to grant more ample privileges, without which the trade\r\nof the Company might often be under restrictions injurious to its\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nIt is not, perhaps, absolutely necessary that the sum subscribed\r\nshould be so considerable as I have stated it, though the larger the\r\nbetter. It is only necessary it should be considerable enough to engage\r\na sufficient number of the principal moneyed men in the scheme. But\r\nCongress must take care to proportion the advantages they give and\r\nreceive.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected, that this plan will be prejudicial to trade, by\r\nmaking the Government a party with a trading Company; which may be\r\na temptation to arrogate exclusive privileges, and thereby fetter\r\nthat spirit of enterprise and competition, on which the prosperity\r\nof commerce depends. But Congress may satisfy the jealousies on this\r\nhead, by a solemn resolution not to grant exclusive privileges, which\r\nalone can make the objection valid. Large trading Companies must be\r\nbeneficial to the commerce of a nation, when they are not invested with\r\nthese, because they furnish a capital with which the most extensive\r\nenterprises may be undertaken. There is no doubt the establishment\r\nproposed would be very serviceable at this juncture, merely in a\r\ncommercial view; for private adventurers are not a match for the\r\nnumerous obstacles resulting from the present posture of affairs.\r\nThe present plan is the product of some reading on the subjects of\r\ncommerce and finance, and of occasional reflections on our particular\r\nsituation: but a want of leisure has prevented its being examined in so\r\nmany lights, and digested so materially, as its importance requires.\r\nIf the outlines are thought worthy of attention, and any difficulties\r\noccur which demand explanation: or if the plan be approved, and the\r\nfurther thoughts of the writer are desired; a letter directed to James\r\nMontague, Esquire, lodged in the post-office at Morristown, will be a\r\nsafe channel of any communications you may think proper to make; and\r\nan immediate answer will be given. Though the writer has reasons which\r\nmake him unwilling to be known; if a personal conference with him\r\nshould be thought material, he will endeavor to comply.\r\n\r\nYou will consider this as a hasty production, and excuse the\r\nincorrectnesses with which it abounds.\r\n\r\n                                  I am, Sir, very respectfully,\r\n                                  Your most obedient and humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n[3] France owes a debt of near two hundred millions of pounds sterling;\r\nof which about twenty-eight millions is due to Governments and\r\nindividuals in the United Provinces.\r\n\r\nEngland owes a debt not much short: of which about thirty millions is\r\nlikewise due in the United Provinces.\r\n\r\nThe United Provinces, themselves, owe a debt of the generality,\r\nof fifty millions sterling besides the particular debts of each\r\nprovince. Russia, Prussia, Denmark, Sweden, all owe money to the\r\nUnited Provinces, notwithstanding the assistance of their mines. These\r\nGovernments, too, are patterns of economy. Sweden receives a constant\r\nsupply from France. The House of Austria is also to be included in the\r\ncatalogue. Spain is almost the only considerable European power to be\r\nexcepted; but this is to be attributed to that inexhaustible fund of\r\ntreasure which she possesses in the mines of South America.\r\n\r\nThe King of Prussia is one of those potentates the least in debt;\r\nnotwithstanding he has a long time made a figure in Europe, much\r\nabove what the comparative strength and resources of his kingdom\r\nentitled him to expect. This his superior genius has effected. By a\r\nwise administration, he maintains an army of one hundred and fifty\r\nthousand men, nearly equal to that of France, with one-third of its\r\npeople, and less than a third of its riches. This he does by judicious\r\narrangements; by a rigid economy; and by a species of commerce, which\r\nis carried on, on account of the State. There are several public\r\nmanufactories, from which the army is supplied; and by the help of\r\nwhich, the money paid out with one hand is taken in by the other.\r\n\r\n[4] This will appear, by recurring to our expenses in the commencement\r\nof the war, before the money was depreciated. In ’75, which was only\r\nthree-fourths of a year, the emissions amounted to seven millions\r\nof dollars: in ’76, to fourteen millions. The war did not begin, in\r\nearnest, till ’76.\r\n\r\n[5] This is meant, without employing the assistance of a foreign loan,\r\nand of other expedients beside borrowing and taxing.\r\n\r\n[6] This will appear from the plan which will be proposed.\r\n\r\n[7] To form an idea of the effect of this plan, let it be supposed that\r\nthe goods imported amount to two millions of pounds sterling, and that\r\nthese sell at one hundred and fifty pounds in paper, for each pound\r\nsterling. The whole proceeds will be eight hundred millions of dollars:\r\nto these add two hundred millions, raised in taxes. There will then be\r\nin the hands of the public, one thousand millions of dollars; which, at\r\nsixty to one, gives sixteen millions six hundred and sixty-six thousand\r\nsix hundred and sixty-six and two-thirds of real dollars. Take the year\r\n’76 for a standard, and suppose fourteen millions of dollars to be\r\nthe proper annual expense of the war, which is only two millions six\r\nhundred and sixty-six thousand six hundred and sixty-six and two-thirds\r\nless than the whole amount of the goods and taxes. At this rate, the\r\nplan would do little more than defray the expenses of the war for one\r\nyear. But this calculation is not exactly true; because the money would\r\ncertainly appreciate, in some degree, by the reduction of its quantity:\r\nyet, as this reduction would not last, at least in the same extent, to\r\npreserve the appreciation; and as, in proportion to the appreciation,\r\nthe price of goods must fall, and bring less money in, it is difficult\r\nto say whether it would not ultimately come to the same thing.\r\n\r\n[8] The taxes are made to increase every year, for the three years;\r\nbecause the money in circulation increases, and, consequently, the\r\npeople can afford to pay more.\r\n\r\n[9] This is sixty paper dollars to one dollar of four shillings and\r\nsixpence sterling; which is the real value of the money. But if it is\r\napprehended that this may meet with opposition, let the valuation of\r\nthe bank notes be the same as the price of European Bills of Exchange.\r\nOther operations must be regulated accordingly.\r\n\r\n[10] The reason of this is, to preserve the idea of a Stock, and make\r\nit seem that the old paper is still in existence. But there is danger,\r\nnotwithstanding the reasons to the contrary, that there may be a run\r\nupon the bank, from particular causes, which may embarrass it. It is\r\nnot probable the old paper will be entirely, though nearly, called out\r\nof circulation: what remains, will appreciate: this may tempt those\r\nwho have bank notes, to demand payment on the terms of the original\r\ndeposit; without considering that, by bringing too great a quantity\r\nagain into circulation, it will again depreciate. The Bank may be\r\npushed to a very disagreeable extremity by this means. I do not know\r\nwhether it may not be advisable to confine the privilege of repayment\r\nto the lenders to the Bank, and make the bills bear interest, payable\r\nevery three months, without making the principal demandable. Much may\r\nbe said for and against. It is well worth consideration.\r\n\r\n[11] This board ought immediately to be established, at all events.\r\nThe Royal Council of Commerce, in France, and the subordinate Chambers\r\nin each province, form an excellent institution, and may, in many\r\nrespects, serve as a model. Congress have too long neglected to\r\norganize a good scheme of administration, and throw public business\r\ninto proper executive departments. For Commerce, I prefer a Board;\r\nbut for most other things, single men. We want a Minister of War, a\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs, a Minister of Finance, and a Minister of\r\nMarine. There is always more decision, more dispatch, more secrecy,\r\nmore responsibility, where single men, than where bodies are concerned.\r\nBy a plan of this kind, we should blend the advantages of a Monarchy\r\nand of a Republic, in a happy and beneficial union. Men will only\r\ndevote their lives and attentions to the mastering a profession, on\r\nwhich they can build reputation and consequence which they do not share\r\nwith others.\r\n\r\nIf this plan should be approved, Congress ought immediately to appoint\r\na Minister of Finance, under whatsoever title they think proper,\r\nand charge him with its execution. He ought to be a man of ability,\r\nto comprehend it in all its consequences; and of eloquence, to make\r\nothers comprehend and relish it. He ought, beside, to have some general\r\nknowledge of the science. This man ought immediately to address himself\r\nto some of the most sensible moneyed men; and endeavor to convince them\r\nof the utility of the project. These must engage others, and so on,\r\ntill a sufficient number is engaged.\r\n\r\nThen Congress must establish the Bank, and set it agoing. I know of\r\nno man that has better pretensions than yourself; and I shall be very\r\nhappy to hear that Congress have said, “Thou art the man.”\r\n\r\nI had like to have omitted one remark, which is, that the subscription\r\nmoney may be guaranteed, if necessary, at 10 to 1, as a greater\r\ninducement. This will only be twenty millions of dollars, or five\r\nmillions of pounds sterling; a cheap bargain to get rid of the\r\nperplexities we labor under, and convert the torrent of ideal money\r\ninto a moderate, but sufficient, stream, to supply the real wants of\r\nthe State. Congress, no doubt, would be able to borrow enough abroad to\r\npay this debt, if it should not find better means within itself. But I\r\nshall be much mistaken, if the proprietors will desire to be repaid,\r\nand not prefer continuing the loan to Government on reasonable terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                         Amboy, March 17, 1780.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nI duly received your letter of the fourteenth, and shall not fail, in\r\nconjunction with General St. Clair, to attend to the military object of\r\nit. I am much obliged to your Excellency for the communication of your\r\nSouthern advices. The enemy are still in the dark about their fleet and\r\narmy gone that way, as we gather from the commissioners. They pretend\r\nto have little European news, though a vessel arrived two or three days\r\nsince from England, after ten weeks passage. We send you some late\r\nNew-York papers.\r\n\r\nThe commission has been several days at an end. The enemy, as was\r\nsupposed, had no idea of treating on national ground. We are now in\r\nprivate conversation, and so far not without hopes that the liberation\r\nof our prisoners will be effected on _admissible_ terms. Two or three\r\ndays more will probably put an end to the interview. General St. Clair\r\nand Colonel Carrington, beg their respects may be presented to your\r\nExcellency.\r\n\r\n                                   I have the honor to be,\r\n                                   Very respectfully and affectionately,\r\n                                   Your Excellency’s most ob’t servant,\r\n                                   Alex. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDU PORTAIL TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  Philadelphia, 21 March, 1780.\r\n\r\nMon Cher Colonel:\r\n\r\nQuoique je compte partir pour le camp dans peu de jours, la crainte\r\nd’être encore retenu plus longtemps que je ne voudrais, (comme je le\r\nsuis depuis un mois), me fait prendre le parti de vous écrire quelque\r\nchose qui me semble d’une certaine importance qui me concerne. Hier\r\nj’ai appris qu’il y a une quinzaine de jours hors de la nouvelle\r\nde l’arrivée des Anglais, un membre du Congrès représenta dans le\r\nCongrès, qu’il serait à propos de m’envoyer en Caroline avec la plus\r\ngrande hâte. Il fonda sa demande sur les choses avantageuses qu’il\r\navait entendu dire de moi, etc., etc. Il voulait que le Congrès\r\nme donnât sur le champ des ordres, et que je partisse sans délai.\r\nJ’ignore quel est le membre qui a fait cette proposition, seulement\r\nje conjecture que c’est quelque delégué dés Etats du sud. On lui a\r\nrépondu, que c’était au _Commandant-en-Chef_ qu’il appartenait de faire\r\nune telle chose, que le Congrès ne pouvait pas savoir s’il n’avait pas\r\nquelque raison de me retenir à son Armée, quoique dans la circonstance\r\nprésente, il parut effectivement que je serais plus utile au sud, en\r\nun mot _que l’attention avec laquelle le Commandant-en-Chef veillait\r\nau salut de l’Etat ne permettait pas de douter qu’il n’employât tous\r\nles moyens qui étaient en son pouvoir, et que les circonstances\r\npermettaient_.\r\n\r\nIl est très agréable, mon cher Colonel, d’être le sujet d’une aussi\r\nbelle phrase, mais je suis fâché que la chose ait tourné ainsi;\r\nje suis aussi très fâché de n’avoir pas su tout cela dans le temps\r\npour vous le mander. Car il était encore temps alors d’aller dans le\r\nsud; maintenant je ne sais plus que désirer. Cependant hier l’on\r\nnous débitait que des vaisseaux de transport servant de vaisseaux\r\nde guerre étaient arrivés à New-York pour prendre des Renforts; si\r\ncela était si confirmé, il n’y aurait apparence que les Anglais ne se\r\nproposaient pas de commencer leurs opérations avant l’arrivée de ces\r\nRenforts, alors ce serait peut être le cas d’y aller. Je laisse tout\r\ncela à faire à votre prudence, et à votre amitié, vous savez une partie\r\ndes raisons que j’ai toujours eu et que j’ai encore de ne point faire\r\nde demande à ce sujet au Général Washington, mais vous savez aussi\r\ncombien je désire d’aller en Caroline. S’il y a quelque apparence que\r\nje puisse y arriver à temps, je ne vois pas d’inconvénient à ce que vous\r\nfaisiez usage auprès du Géneral de ce qui s’est passé dans le Congrès,\r\nparce que plusieurs membres de Congrès l’ont déjà dit à différentes\r\npersonnes.\r\n\r\n(Si vous voulez ensuite que je vous parle comme à mon ami, je vous\r\ndirai que j’ai eu lieu de voir que de m’envoyer là bas, aurait fait un\r\nfort bon effet ici, surtout dans le commencement.)\r\n\r\nSupposez donc, que notre Géneral jugeât par des circonstances\r\nultérieures qu’il peut encore être temps de m’y envoyer, comme il ne\r\nfaut pas perdre un moment, il serait bon que je ne fusse pas obligé de\r\nretourner au camp. Pour cela il faudrait m’envoyer avec les ordres,\r\ntoutes les lettres nécessaires pour le Géneral Lincoln et autres. Vous\r\nsavez, mon cher Colonel, ce que je désire à cet égard. Si je vais là-bas,\r\nil faut que mon arrivée soit comme un de ces accidents au théâtre\r\nqui réveille les spectateurs, et redonne de l’activité et de la chaleur\r\nà la pièce, vous m’entendez.\r\n\r\nJe crois que dans ce cas le Général doit écrire au Congrès, outre les\r\nraisons qu’il a de m’envoyer pour le prier de me faire donner tous les\r\nmoyens nécessaires pour faire diligence.\r\n\r\nEnfin, prenez bien garde à ceci, mon cher Colonel, si vous m’envoyez\r\ndes ordres, sitôt que cela sera décidé, envoyez chercher Monsieur\r\nde l’Estaing, mon Aide-de-Camp, et dites lui s’il vous plaît de faire\r\npartir sur le champ ma malle et la sienne sur un waggon du quartier\r\nmaître, s’il y en a qui partant sur le champ, sinon sur mon propre\r\nwaggon: qu’il n’oublie pas surtout mes papiers. Il peut ensuite venir\r\naprès lui même et m’apporter les lettres du Général. Il faut qu’il\r\nfasse diligence; je ne puis partir sans différentes choses qui sont\r\ndans ma malle; qu’il se munisse lui même de ce qu’il lui faut. Mon\r\nadresse ici est: Mrs. Sword in Logan Alley, Second-street.\r\n\r\nJe ne partirai point d’ici avant lundi prochain afin d’attendre votre\r\nréponse.\r\n\r\n                            J’ai l’honneur d’être, mon cher Colonel,\r\n                            Avec le plus parfait attachment,\r\n                            Votre très humble et très obéissant servant,\r\n                            Du Portail.\r\n\r\nCol. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHUYLER TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   Philadelphia, April 8, 1780.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\n* * * * * * You have been mentioned in private conversation\r\nto go as Secretary to the Embassy at the Court of Versailles;\r\nthere is but one obstacle which prevents me from making up my\r\nmind on the subject; that you will know when I have the pleasure\r\nof seeing you. In the mean time revolve the matter in yours.\r\n\r\nThe pride, the folly, and perhaps, too, the wickedness of some on a\r\ncertain floor, combine to frustrate every intention to promote the\r\npublic weal, and relieve my amiable Chief from his well-grounded\r\nanxiety; the few that feel for him, and are alarmed at the critical\r\nstate of our public affairs, in every department, within as well as\r\nwithout, have not been able to carry a measure which they believed\r\nwould have had salutary consequences. They have now proposed that a\r\nCommittee should repair to head quarters, invested conjointly with\r\nthe General, with a kind of dictatorial power, in order to afford\r\nsatisfaction to the army, and to arrange the great departments\r\nthereof. Livingston, Elsworth, and Matthews, are appointed to prepare\r\nInstructions. Some good may result, if gentlemen who love the General,\r\nare not jealous of the army, and of a generous turn are sent; but\r\nshould General Sherman be at the head of the Triumviri, the General\r\nwill be tormented with a thousand little propositions which Roger has\r\nthrown together, and which he entitles a System. I shall not be sent on\r\nthis business, “because, it would not be proper to send a person who,\r\nas he has been in the army, will probably have a bias in its favor.”\r\nThis reasoning is conclusive.\r\n\r\nBeware of communications to this quarter, which you would not wish the\r\nworld to know; this hint will prevent you from writing but by a safe\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nIt is amusing to observe the effect Sir Harry Clinton’s private No.\r\n15 has. The Southernites have their spirits much raised by it. The\r\nNortherns look big, and the enemy’s distress is owing to their virtue\r\nand exertions. They wish for the 12,000 Hessians to have the pleasure\r\nof devouring them. The war is to be at an end next winter, and as they\r\nwish to conclude handsomely, they will insist that their constituents\r\ncomplete their quotas without delay, and furnish aids of money, &c. En\r\nverité there are only two or three of the club who believe the letter\r\nspurious, but two who are decidedly of that opinion.\r\n\r\nMy best wishes to all at head quarters.\r\n\r\n                                        I am, dear Sir, sincerely yours,\r\n                                        Ph. Schuyler.\r\n\r\nCol. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO BARON STEUBEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           May 10, 1780.\r\n\r\nDear Baron:\r\n\r\nGeneral Knox, in conversation, has observed to the General, that\r\ninstead of sending to Philadelphia for the fifteen hundred arms\r\nmentioned in your letter of the sixth, and sending those here to that\r\nplace to be fitted, it would be a great saving of expense, in the\r\narticle of transportation, to have the bayonets and accoutrements\r\nbrought on without the arms, and fitted to those now here; which can\r\neasily be done at the Park. The question is, if the arms here have no\r\nother defect than want of bayonets. The General will be glad to know\r\nwhat you think of General Knox’s proposal. It seems to him eligible,\r\nunless there are reasons he is not acquainted with.\r\n\r\nIf there are any other articles you wish to have sent for (the General\r\nthinks you mentioned something of the kind to him), he will be glad to\r\nknow what they are.\r\n\r\nWe have heard from the Marquis. He will be here at dinner. Will you\r\ndine with us also? The General requests it.\r\n\r\n                                     I have the honor to be, dear Baron,\r\n                                     Your very humble servant,\r\n                                     Alex. Hamilton, A. D. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO DUANE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           May 14, 1780.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir:\r\n\r\nThis will be handed you by the Marquis, who brings us very important\r\nintelligence. The General communicates the substance of it in a private\r\nletter to you, and proposes a measure which all deem essential. For\r\nGod’s sake, my dear sir, engage Congress to adopt it, and come to a\r\nspeedy decision. We have not a moment to lose. Were we to improve every\r\ninstant of the interval, we should have too little time for what we\r\nhave to do. The expected succor may arrive in the beginning of June,\r\nin all probability it will not be later than the middle. In the last\r\ncase we have not a month to make our preparations in, and in this short\r\nperiod we must collect men, form magazines, and do a thousand things of\r\nas much difficulty as importance. The propriety of the measure proposed\r\nis so obvious, that an hour ought to decide it, and if any new members\r\nare to come, they ought to set out instantly with all expedition for\r\nhead quarters. Allow me, my dear sir, to give you a hint. The General\r\nwill often be glad to consult the Committee on particular points, but\r\nit will be inexpedient that he should be obliged to do it oftener than\r\nhe thinks proper, or any peculiar case may require. Their powers should\r\nbe formed accordingly. It is the essence of many military operations,\r\nthat they should be trusted to as few as possible.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis has a title to all the love of all America; but you know he\r\nhas a thousand little whims to satisfy; one of these he _will have_ me\r\nto write to some friend in Congress about. He is desirous of having the\r\nCaptain of the frigate in which he came complimented; and gives several\r\npretty instances of his punctuality and disinterestedness. He wishes\r\nCongress to pass some resolutions of thanks, and to recommend him to\r\ntheir Minister in France, to be recommended to the French Court. The\r\nfirst of these is practicable. The last I think might have an officious\r\nappearance. The _essential_ services the Marquis has rendered America\r\nin France, give him a claim for all that can be done with propriety;\r\nbut Congress must not commit themselves.\r\n\r\nAgain, my dear sir, I must entreat you to use the spur on the present\r\noccasion. The fate of America is perhaps suspended on the issue; if we\r\nare found unprepared, it must disgrace us in the eyes of all Europe,\r\nbesides defeating the good intentions of our allies, and losing the\r\nhappiest opportunity we ever have had to save ourselves. Adieu, my dear\r\nSir.\r\n\r\nBelieve me to be, with the truest respect and affection,\r\n\r\n                                               Your most obed’t servant,\r\n                                               A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n  Hon. James Duane, Philadelphia.\r\n  Honored by Marquis De Lafayette.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO BARON STEUBEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           June 7, 1780.\r\n\r\nDear Baron:\r\n\r\nI am commanded by the General to inform you, that the enemy are out in\r\nconsiderable force; and, by the last advice, were advancing this way.\r\nWe are going to meet them. The General is just set out for Chatham, and\r\nwill be happy to meet you there.\r\n\r\n                                          Yours, respectfully,\r\n                                          A. Hamilton, A. D. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           June 8, 1780.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nI have seen the enemy. Those in view I calculate at about three\r\nthousand: there may be, and probably enough are, others out of sight.\r\nThey have sent all their horse to the other side, except about fifty\r\nor sixty. Their baggage, it is agreed on all hands, has also been sent\r\nacross, and their wounded. It is not ascertained that any of their\r\ninfantry have passed to the other side. There are four or five hundred\r\non the opposite point; but it is uncertain whether they are those who\r\nwent from this side, or those who were on Staten Island. I rather\r\nsuppose the former.\r\n\r\nDifferent conjectures may be made. The present movement may be\r\ncalculated to draw us down and betray us into an action. They may have\r\ndesisted from their intention of passing till night, for fear of our\r\nfalling upon their rear. I believe this is the case: for as they have\r\nbut few boats, it would certainly be a delicate manœuvre to cross in\r\nour face. We are taking measures to watch their motions to-night, as\r\nclosely as possible. An incessant but _very light_ skirmishing. Very\r\nfew boats, not more than enough to carry three or four hundred men at a\r\ntime. It is likely more will come down this evening.\r\n\r\n                                I have the honor to be,\r\n                                Your Excellency’s most obedient servant,\r\n                                Alex. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO CHEVALIER DE TERNAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Au Cap Henry, le 13 Juin, 1780.\r\n\r\nMonsieur le Chevalier:\r\n\r\nJe suis envoyé par le Général Washington au Cap Henry pour y attendre\r\nvotre escadre et vous remettre ainsi qu’à Monsieur le Comte de\r\nRochambau, les dépêches de Monsieur le Marquis de La Fayette--ces\r\ndépêches, Monsieur le Chevalier, contiennent le plan d’opérations que\r\nle Général Washington a l’honneur de vous proposer, la situation des\r\nennemies et la nôtre relativement aux forces respectives des deux\r\nparties, aux points occupés, aux moyens de subsistance et cetéra; tous\r\nles changements qui pouvraient survenir sur ces objets doivent m’être\r\ncommuniqués, afin qu’à votre arrivée vous puissiez avoir sous les yeux\r\nle plus de données possibles. Les mêmes détails vous attendent à Rhode\r\nIsland, et si vous ne devez les reçevoir qu’après être arrivé, il est\r\npresque indifférent, Monsieur le Chevalier, que votre escadre atterisse\r\nà Rhode Island ou au Cap Henry; mais il y a des circonstances qui, si\r\nelles vous étaient connues, tendraient peut être à vous déterminer\r\nplutôt pour l’un de ces points que pour l’autre, ou même pour un\r\ntroisième point que vos instructions n’ont pu prévoir. C’est pour vous\r\nrendre compte de ces circonstances que je saisis l’occasion du fier\r\nRodrique; heureux si, dans une conjoncture où les moments sont d’une si\r\ngrande importance, cette lettre peut anticiper de quelques jours vos\r\ndispositions.\r\n\r\n1º. Par le plan proposé à vous, Monsieur le Chevalier, et à Monsieur\r\nle Comte de Rochambau, les efforts combinés de l’armée Française et\r\nAmericaine doivent se porter sur New-York, et vous êtes instamment prié\r\nde vous rendre immédiatement à Sandy Hook.\r\n\r\n2º. Suivant les informations qui m’ont été récemment fournies par\r\nle Gouverneur de la Virginie, la ville de Charlestown est prise; les\r\nennemis embarquent une partie des troupes qui en ont fait la Conquête;\r\net d’après la certitude où nous sommes que la destination de votre\r\nescadre leur est connue, il semble que cet embarquement pourrait bien\r\navoir pour objet de renforcer la garnison de New-York.\r\n\r\n3º. La somme de leurs forces navales sur ce continent se borne à trois\r\nvaisseaux de ligne, un de 50 canons, deux de 44, et quelques frégates à\r\nCharlestown; un vaisseau de 74 et quelques frégates, sortis de New-York\r\ndepuis trois semaines et dont nous ignorons la destination.\r\n\r\nAinsi, Monsieur le Chevalier, la première de ces considérations vous\r\ninvite à Sandy Hook; la seconde réclame votre atterrage sur un point\r\nd’où vous puissiez être en mesure d’intercepter les Secours destinés\r\npour New-York, et la troisième vous offre un terme de comparaison entre\r\nla plus grande force qui puisse escorter ces secours, et celle avec\r\nlaquelle vous pouvez les attaquer. Il est encore à observer qu’excepté\r\nles trois vaisseaux de ligne, tous les autres (à Charlestown) sont dans\r\nle port, et que les plus gros n’en peuvent sortir, qu’après avoir été\r\nallégés, et avec la concurrence d’une haute marée et d’un vent propice.\r\n\r\nTelles sont, Monsieur le Chevalier, les choses dont ma mission a pour\r\nobjet de vous rendre compte, et comme il est de toute importance que\r\nces informations vous parviennent le plus tôt possible, j’ai cru ne pas\r\ndevoir négliger la probabilité, qui s’offre de les faire devancer votre\r\narrivée.\r\n\r\nEn supposant, Monsieur le Chevalier, que le fier Rodrique vous\r\nrencontre et que vous jugiez à propos de vous rendre en droiture\r\nà Sandy Hook, il est un moyen de faire que les dépâches qui vous\r\nattendent à Rhode Island et du Cap Henry vous parviennent aussi\r\npromptement qui si vous aviez atterri à l’un de ces deux points: ce\r\nserait de dépêcher, vers l’un ou l’autre, l’un de vos plus légers\r\nvaisseaux qui recevrait à son bord l’officier chargé de ces dépêches,\r\net vous irait rejoindre vers Sandy Hook, où vraisemblablement il se\r\nrendrait aussitôt que votre flotte, ou du moins beaucoup plus tôt que\r\nles réponses de Général Washington ou de Monsieur le Marquis de La\r\nFayette, aux lettres qui leur annonceraient votre arrivée.\r\n\r\nSi le Cap Henry était le point choisi, j’oserais vous prier, Monsieur\r\nle Chevalier, afin d’éviter tous délais, d’ordonner qu’à la vue, du\r\nsignal que vous savez, le vaisseau y réponde par un signal contraire,\r\nje veux dire en avertissant la position des pavillons; qu’il envoie\r\nsa chaloupe à terre avec un officier muni des mots de reconnaissance;\r\nque cet officier me donne la première partie de ces mots et reçoive\r\nde moi la seconde. Par là je crois, Monsieur le Chevalier, que toute\r\npossibilité de surprise est sauvée, de part et d’autre, sans qu’il y\r\nait un seul instant de perdre par le Cérémonial de la reconnaissance.\r\n\r\n                                                   Je suis, &c. &c. &c.\r\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nA Monsieur le Chevalier de Ternay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO BARON STEUBEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       Whippany, June 25, 1780.\r\n\r\nDear Baron:\r\n\r\nThe enemy, the day before yesterday, made a forward movement to\r\nSpringfield, which they burnt, and retired to Elizabethtown Point. The\r\nsame evening they crossed over to Staten Island; and there are a great\r\nmany concurring circumstances which make it probable we shall next\r\nhear of them on the North River. As you are at West Point, the General\r\nwishes you to remain there until the present appearances come to some\r\nresult. He has confidence in your judgment, and wishes you to give your\r\nadvice and assistance to the commanding officer. As you have no command\r\nin the post, you can only do this in a private friendly way: but I dare\r\nsay General Howe will be happy to consult you. You will consider this\r\nas a private letter, in which I rather convey you the General’s wishes\r\nthan his commands.\r\n\r\nAll the army is in march toward you, and will be at Pompton this\r\nevening.\r\n\r\n                                   I have the honor to be,\r\n                                   Very respectfully and affectionately,\r\n                                   Your humble servant,\r\n                                   Alex. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO BARON STEUBEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Head-Quarters, Ramapo, June 30, 1780.\r\n\r\nAgreeably to your request, my dear Baron, I communicated your project\r\nto the General. Happily the inactivity of the enemy has given us time\r\nto make dispositions which render the calling out of the militia\r\nunnecessary; and the whole has been accordingly countermanded.\r\n\r\nThe General requests that when you have completed the object of your\r\nerrand in your department, and put things in train, you will rejoin the\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nI wrote you a line from Whippany, of which you made no mention.\r\n\r\n                                          I have the honor to be, yours,\r\n                                          A. H.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO BARON STEUBEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  Head-Quarters, July 23, 1780.\r\n\r\nI have received, my dear Baron, your two letters of the sixteenth and\r\neighteenth. On the formation of the Light Infantry, the General has\r\nalready written to you. I presume it will be, ultimately, nearly as you\r\nhave proposed.\r\n\r\nSmith set out, some days since, to join you. Bradford, I am told, is\r\nundecided about entering into the office. Col. Scammel has promised\r\nto bring him to me; and if he accepts, we will forward him. I believe\r\nPrescott will be appointed in the Light Infantry. _Entre nous_, ’tis\r\nnot easy to find good Majors for this corps in the Massachusetts Line;\r\nand as it will act a good deal with the French troops, we wish it (for\r\nthis additional reason) to be well officered. Prescott will answer\r\nthe purpose: but he is not yet to know that he is in contemplation.\r\nWe shall not long continue in our present position. The distinctions\r\nof departments are an old story, which now do not exist except with\r\nrespect to South Carolina. You are with a detachment of the main army.\r\n\r\nI dare say all you are doing will be found right. I shall join my\r\n_beau-pere_ to save you from the cord. The arrangement for your\r\ndepartment was unfortunately sent to Congress soon after you went\r\nfrom here; with the most pressing instances to determine upon it\r\nwithout delay. We have heard nothing of it since. We have repeated our\r\n_prayers_ and _exhortations_. If we get no answer in three or four\r\ndays, we must determine for ourselves.\r\n\r\nMajor Francis is returned from Philadelphia; but I have not seen him\r\nsince the arrival of your letters. I will move the inquiry you wish,\r\nwhen I see him. Can you do any thing for him in your department?\r\n\r\nA severe stroke upon us, is, that our arms, expected from France, are\r\nnot arrived. I do not know how we shall be able to arm our recruits.\r\n\r\nGraves sailed from the Hook the nineteenth. We had been playing off and\r\non two days.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my dear Baron, and believe me always, with the most respectful\r\nattachment,\r\n\r\n                                                    Your humble servant,\r\n                                                    A. H.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBAUMAN TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   West Point, August 13, 1780.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nI cannot help laying before you a few of my thoughts, which lately\r\nhave engrossed my whole attention, on the review of our changeable\r\ngovernment at West Point. However, I hope you will make no other use\r\nof them but such as may be of advantage; and whatever may be improper,\r\nor improperly stated, impute to my inability only: and there you\r\nwill please to let it rest, and take in good part what I shall say,\r\nas it proceeds from a zeal of affection to you, and from a regard to\r\nthe cause I am engaged in. On this consideration you will excuse me,\r\nif any where I should seem to exceed those bounds which custom has\r\nprescribed to subalterns, when they treat of any thing, or adopt modes,\r\nto their superiors.\r\n\r\nA continual change of commanding officers, or commandants, is, in my\r\nhumble opinion, injurious to this post, and hurtful to the military\r\nduty, so absolutely requisite to be performed, and preserved in a\r\ngarrison. As there is no nation at war which pursues the like mode\r\nexcepting us; I am therefore induced, not only from this consideration,\r\nbut from weighty experience during my station at this post, to offer\r\nan opinion of its impropriety, and bad consequences. The visible ill\r\nit creates; the damage to innumerable things; the irregularity it\r\ncontinually causes; and lastly, the total loss of the many thousands\r\nwhich have been, and daily are, expended on this national fabric, which\r\ninevitably must fall to pieces, unless an officer is fixed to this\r\npost (and who ought to be a competent judge of fortifications, and a\r\nmilitary man), are matters which, I think, demand consideration.\r\n\r\nA Town-Major, and a good Barrack-Master, are as necessary here, as\r\nthe necessaries of life are. The former to regulate the duty and to\r\nkeep up discipline in this jurisdiction: the latter to take care of\r\nthe buildings, which must otherwise be destroyed. The next thing which\r\nfalls to our attention, is the public provision, which has been, and\r\ndaily is, exposed here to be lost, to be stolen, and to be damaged, for\r\nwant of sufficient shelter and proper repositories. The troops have\r\nsuffered, and still suffer, from these and other causes. They have\r\nbeen cheated in weights, in measure, and in their scanty allowance of\r\nfatigue rum; which I can attest, by being appointed, after my having\r\nrepresented the matter to General M’Dougall, to inspect into some of\r\nthose abuses. Notwithstanding the many thousands of boards which came\r\nhere, there are not sufficient for barracks, bunks, etc. For as fast\r\nas one thing is built up, another is torn down again. There is not,\r\nin all this garrison, a proper guard-house for the conveniency of\r\nsoldiers, nor for the security of the criminals. No powder magazine,\r\nnor a store for the reception and reserve of the implements of war. In\r\nshort, the whole appears, at present, under the care of ungovernable\r\nand undisciplined militia, like a wild Tartar’s camp, instead of that\r\nshining fortification all America thinks not only an insurmountable\r\nbarrier against the incursion of its enemy, but likewise an easy\r\ndefence in case of an unforeseen disaster of its army.\r\n\r\nHowever, to return to my subject. The importance of those heads already\r\nmentioned, and their connection with those preceding, will, I hope,\r\nobtain your pardon for the digression into which they have led me; and\r\nto your discretion I shall leave what I state.\r\n\r\nIn a letter I wrote to General Knox some time last winter, among many\r\nthings I had to say concerning the ordnance and myself, I made this\r\nremark, to wit: “That relieving of an officer from a garrison, is not\r\nlike a relief in the field: for an officer who knows himself to be\r\nrelieved, will leave many things undone for the next to do; which I\r\nhave seen, heard, and experienced. Beside, after once every thing is to\r\nrights, the men then ought to desist from labor, and exercise the guns.\r\nBut new commanding officers have chiefly new systems of defence, which\r\nadd labor to labor, and nothing will be formed systematically.”\r\n\r\nI have already stated these and more things minutely to the general\r\nofficers here, who all agreed in their validity and propriety. But\r\nthey, being all liable to immediate removal, there cannot be any thing\r\nformed into a permanent and regular system. Moreover, I have been\r\ninformed, that owing to the mismanagement of their predecessors, they\r\nwere obliged, after they had taken the command, to hunt for materials\r\nin order to build their own systems; and to issue orders upon orders,\r\nto acquaint themselves with those persons who have, as it were, in\r\nkeeping, the several branches which flow into this department.\r\n\r\nAnd let me once more, in confidence, assure you, that I suffer\r\nincessant pain from the sad state this garrison is in. To rectify\r\ndefects, my dear sir, when roused to arms, can never be attainable.\r\nTherefore let me beg you to assist in adopting some plan which may be\r\nsoldierly, for the good of the service: which, however, can be done\r\nin no other manner, but such as I have hinted to you. For let General\r\nArnold have all the sagacity imaginable, it will take him some time\r\nto get himself well acquainted with the position and defence of this\r\npost; especially as there is not one single Continental officer left\r\nhere who can in any way assist him. Every thing seems new here; and the\r\nvery engineer is transferred from hence, on whom he, in some measure,\r\ncould have depended for information, with regard to the weakest and\r\nstrongest parts of this fortress. And I have not yet told you the one\r\nhundredth part of what I have to say upon some of these subjects; but I\r\nshall finish with prognosticating, that should ever capriciousness hold\r\nsway here, it may prove fatal to this post.\r\n\r\n                                            I am, with due respect, Sir,\r\n                                            Your most humble servant,\r\n                                            S. Bauman,\r\n                                            Major of Artillery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDE MARBOIS TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   Philadelphia, 21 Aout, 1780.\r\n\r\nJe viens de recevoir mon cher Colonel votre lettre du 17 de ce mois.\r\nVous m’y parlez de mes Frères comme si vous étiez sûr qu’ils sont en\r\neffet prisonniers. Avez-vous sur cet article plus de connaissance que\r\nje n’en ai, on m’avez-vous déjà écrit à ce sujet quelque lettre qui ne\r\nme serait point parvenue. Je vais écrire à M. de Ternay à ce sujet,\r\nmais en attendant je vous prie de vouloir bien me communiquer tous les\r\néclaircissements que vous aurez pu vous procurer, et d’être persuadé\r\nque rien ne me touche plus que de leur procurer de soulagement s’ils\r\nsont en effet entre les mains de l’ennemi.\r\n\r\nSi vous avez quelques nouvelles dernières touchant l’embarcation que\r\nM. le Général Clinton prépare, je vous prie de vouloir bien m’en\r\ninstruire, cet article étant de la plus grande importance pour nous. Je\r\nvous embrasse de tout mon cœur.\r\n\r\n                                                    De Marbois.\r\n\r\nCol. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Hillsborough, August 30, 1780.\r\n\r\nDear Hamilton:\r\n\r\nAbout the twenty-third instant, I wrote my friend Harrison from\r\nSalisbury, giving him a very hasty particular account of the defeat\r\nof General Gates’s army at Sutton’s, near Campden, the sixteenth\r\ninstant. We were truly unfortunate, and completely routed. The infamous\r\ncowardice of the militia of Virginia and North Carolina, gave the enemy\r\nevery advantage over our few regular troops, whose firm opposition\r\nand gallant behavior have gained them the applause, as well of our\r\nsuccessful foes, as of our runaway friends. If I mentioned to Col.\r\nHarrison the loss of two howitzers, I was mistaken. We had eight\r\npieces of light artillery, with six ammunition wagons, which, with the\r\ngreatest part of our baggage, were lost.\r\n\r\nOur retreat was the most mortifying that could have happened. Those who\r\nescaped the dangers of the field, knew not where to find protection:\r\nthe wounded found no relief from the inhabitants, who were immediately\r\nin arms against us; and many of our fugitive officers and men were\r\ndisarmed by those faithless villains, who had flattered us with\r\npromises of joining us against the enemy. The tories are now assembling\r\nin different parts of the country; and there is actually a sort of\r\npartisan war waged between them and the whigs of this country.\r\n\r\nThe greatest part of our baggage was plundered by those who first left\r\nthe field. The enemy took a part; and much of what escaped them, has\r\nbeen pillaged by the inhabitants on the retreat. The wagon horses have\r\nbeen stolen, and frequently taken from the drivers; and some of those\r\ndesperate rascals have been daring enough to fire upon parties of our\r\nregular troops many miles from the place of action.\r\n\r\nGeneral Gates used the utmost expedition in getting from the lost field\r\nto this place. As this step is unaccountable to me, you must expect to\r\nknow the reason another time, and from better authority. An unfortunate\r\nGeneral usually loses the confidence of his army; and this is much the\r\ncase with us at present. However, I suppose every thing necessary will\r\nbe done, in justification of the steps that have been taken, and then\r\nall will be understood. Beside my ignorance, there is another reason\r\nfor my silence on this subject. The General is extremely mortified at\r\nthe disappointment his hopes have met with; and I think it ungenerous\r\nto oppress dejected spirits by a premature censure.\r\n\r\nThe legislature of this State is now sitting at this place, and\r\ndevising means of defending the country. The General has exhibited\r\nestimates (he informs me) of the supplies wanting to carry on the\r\ncampaign, both to the legislature of this State, and to Virginia; and\r\nhopes they will be furnished. The officers of North Carolina talk\r\nconfidently of re-embodying a great number of militia. General Stephens\r\nhad collected about eight hundred of the Virginia militia at this place\r\nsince the action. But I am sorry to add, at least half that number have\r\ndeserted. The Maryland Division, including the Delaware regiment, will,\r\nI hope, muster six hundred when all are collected. Part are now here: a\r\nparty are with General Smallwood at Ellis’s Ferry, Adkin river; and a\r\nsmall party with Major Anderson, who General Smallwood left some time\r\nat Charlotte, to receive the fugitives as they arrived. But this is the\r\nplace of general rendezvous.\r\n\r\nFrom the best accounts I can get, Lord Cornwallis had with him, on\r\nthe day of battle, the seventy-first, sixty-third, thirty-third, and\r\ntwenty-third British regiments; a corps of Hessians, Tarlton’s legion,\r\nand some new levies, amounting to about three thousand men. Our numbers\r\nwere very little greater; and our force will not be imagined so great,\r\nby those who are informed of our long march in a barren country, with\r\nvery little other subsistence than a short allowance of fresh beef,\r\ngreen corn, apples, and peaches.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I recover from a relaxation of spirits, which is all my\r\npresent complaint, I will write you again, and inform you that we are\r\nresolved not to despair, but bear our fortunes like veterans in the\r\nSouth; while you, like heroes in the North, win and wear the laurels\r\nof the present campaign. Present my most respectful compliments to\r\nthe General, whom I love; to all my friends at head quarters and in\r\ncamp. Not a man among you have been generous enough to write a single\r\nsentence to\r\n\r\n                                        Your sincere friend and servant,\r\n                                        O. H. Williams.\r\n\r\nI mentioned the surprise of General Sumpter’s party, which happened the\r\nsixteenth instant, in my last.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO JAMES DUANE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Liberty Pole, September 8, 1780.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nAgreeably to your request, and my promise, I sit down to give you my\r\nideas of the defects of our present system, and the changes necessary\r\nto save us from ruin. They may, perhaps, be the reveries of a\r\nprojector, rather than the sober views of a politician. You will judge\r\nof them, and make what use you please of them.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental defect is a want of power in Congress. It is hardly\r\nworth while to show in what this consists, as it seems to be\r\nuniversally acknowledged; or to point out how it has happened, as the\r\nonly question is how to remedy it. It may, however, be said, that it\r\nhas originated from three causes; an excess of the spirit of liberty,\r\nwhich has made the particular States show a jealousy of all power not\r\nin their own hands; and this jealousy has led them to exercise a right\r\nof judging in the last resort of the measures recommended by Congress,\r\nand of acting according to their own opinions of their propriety,\r\nor necessity; a diffidence, in Congress, of their own powers, by\r\nwhich they have been timid and indecisive in their resolutions:\r\nconstantly making concessions to the States, till they have scarcely\r\nleft themselves the shadow of power; a want of sufficient means at\r\ntheir disposal to answer the public exigencies, and of vigor to draw\r\nforth those means; which have occasioned them to depend on the\r\nStates individually, to fulfil their engagements with the army; the\r\nconsequence of which, has been to ruin their influence and credit with\r\nthe army, to establish its dependence on each State separately, rather\r\nthan _on them_, that is, rather than on the whole collectively.\r\n\r\nIt may be pleaded, that Congress had never any definite powers granted\r\nthem, and, of course, could exercise none, could do nothing more\r\nthan recommend. The manner in which Congress was appointed, would\r\nwarrant, and the public good required, that they should have considered\r\nthemselves as vested with full power _to preserve the republic from\r\nharm_. They have done many of the highest acts of sovereignty, which\r\nwere always cheerfully submitted to: The declaration of independence;\r\nthe declaration of war: the levying of an army; creating a navy;\r\nemitting money; making alliances with foreign powers; appointing a\r\ndictator, etc., etc. All these implications of a complete sovereignty\r\nwere never disputed, and ought to have been a standard for the whole\r\nconduct of administration. Undefined powers are discretionary powers,\r\nlimited only by the object for which they were given; in the present\r\ncase, the independence and freedom of America. The Confederation\r\nmade no difference; for as it has not been generally adopted, it had\r\nno operation. But from what I recollect of it, Congress have even\r\ndescended from the authority which the spirit of that act gives them;\r\nwhile the particular States have no further attended to it, than as it\r\nsuited their pretensions and convenience. It would take too much time\r\nto enter into particular instances, each of which separately might\r\nappear inconsiderable; but united, are of serious import. I only mean\r\nto remark, not to censure.\r\n\r\nBut the Confederation itself is defective, and requires to be altered.\r\nIt is neither fit for war nor peace. The idea of an uncontrollable\r\nsovereignty, in each State, over its internal police, will defeat\r\nthe other powers given to Congress, and make our union feeble and\r\nprecarious. There are instances without number, where Acts, necessary\r\nfor the general good, and which rise out of the powers given to\r\nCongress, must interfere with the internal police of the States;\r\nand there are as many instances in which the particular States, by\r\narrangements of internal police, can effectually, though indirectly,\r\ncounteract the arrangements of Congress. You have already had examples\r\nof this, for which I refer you to your own memory.\r\n\r\nThe Confederation gives the States, individually, too much influence in\r\nthe affairs of the army. They should have nothing to do with it. The\r\nentire formation and disposal of our military forces, ought to belong\r\nto Congress. It is an essential cement of the union: and it ought to\r\nbe the policy of Congress, to destroy all ideas of State attachments\r\nin the army, and make it look up wholly to them. For this purpose, all\r\nappointments, promotions, and provisions, whatsoever, ought to be made\r\nby them. It may be apprehended that this may be dangerous to liberty.\r\nBut nothing appears more evident to me, than that we run much greater\r\nrisk of having a weak and disunited federal government, than one which\r\nwill be able to usurp upon the rights of the people.\r\n\r\nAlready some of the lines of the army would obey their States in\r\nopposition to Congress, notwithstanding the pains we have taken to\r\npreserve the unity of the army. If any thing would hinder this, it\r\nwould be the personal influence of the General; a melancholy and\r\nmortifying consideration.\r\n\r\nThe forms of our State constitutions, must always give them great\r\nweight in our affairs, and will make it too difficult to bend them to\r\nthe pursuit of a common interest; too easy to oppose whatever they do\r\nnot like: and to form partial combinations subversive of the general\r\none. There is a wide difference between our situation, and that of an\r\nempire under one simple form of government, distributed into counties,\r\nprovinces, or districts, which have no legislatures, but merely\r\nmagistratical bodies, to execute the laws of a common sovereign. Here\r\nthe danger is, that the sovereign will have too much power, and oppress\r\nthe parts of which it is composed. In our case, that of an empire\r\ncomposed of confederated States; each with a government completely\r\norganized within itself, having all the means to draw its subjects to\r\na close dependence on itself; the danger is directly the reverse. It\r\nis, that the common sovereign will not have power sufficient to unite\r\nthe different members together, and direct the common forces to the\r\ninterest and happiness of the whole.\r\n\r\nThe leagues among the old Grecian republics are a proof of this. They\r\nwere continually at war with each other; and, for want of union, fell\r\na prey to their neighbors. They frequently held general councils; but\r\ntheir resolutions were no further observed, than as they suited the\r\ninterests and inclinations of all the parties; and, at length, they\r\nsunk entirely into contempt.\r\n\r\nThe Swiss Cantons are another proof of the doctrine. They have had\r\nwars with each other, which would have been fatal to them, had not\r\nthe different powers, in their neighborhood, been too jealous of one\r\nanother, and too equally matched, to suffer either to take advantage of\r\ntheir quarrels. That they have remained so long united at all, is to be\r\nattributed to their weakness, to their poverty, and to the causes just\r\nmentioned. These ties will not exist in America; a little time hence,\r\nsome of the States will be powerful empires; and we are so remote from\r\nother nations, that we shall have all the leisure and opportunity we\r\ncan wish, to cut each other’s throats.\r\n\r\nThe Germanic corps might also be cited as an example in favor of the\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nThe United Provinces may be thought to be one against it. But the\r\nfamily of the Stadtholders, whose authority is interwoven with the\r\nwhole Government, has been a strong link of union between them.\r\nTheir physical necessities, and the habits founded upon them, have\r\ncontributed to it.\r\n\r\nEach province is too inconsiderable, by itself, to undertake any thing.\r\nAn analysis of their present constitutions, would show that they have\r\nmany ties which would not exist in ours; and that they are by no means\r\na proper model for us.\r\n\r\nOur own experience should satisfy us. We have felt the difficulty of\r\ndrawing out the resources of the country, and inducing the States to\r\ncombine in equal exertions for the common cause.\r\n\r\nThe ill success of our last attempt is striking. Some have done a\r\ngreat deal; others little, or scarcely any thing. The disputes about\r\nboundaries, etc., testify how flattering a prospect we have of future\r\ntranquillity, if we do not frame, in time, a confederacy capable\r\nof deciding the differences, and compelling the obedience of the\r\nrespective members.\r\n\r\nThe Confederation, too, gives the power of the purse too entirely\r\nto the State Legislatures. It should provide perpetual funds, in\r\nthe disposal of Congress, by a land tax, poll tax, or the like. All\r\nimposts upon commerce ought to be laid by Congress, and appropriated\r\nto their use. For, without certain revenues, a Government can have no\r\npower. That power which holds the purse-strings absolutely, must rule.\r\nThis seems to be a medium which, without making Congress altogether\r\nindependent, will tend to give reality to its authority.\r\n\r\nAnother defect in our system, is want of method and energy in the\r\nadministration. This has partly resulted from the other defect; but\r\nin a great degree from prejudice, and the want of a proper executive.\r\nCongress have kept the power too much in their own hands, and have\r\nmeddled too much with details of every sort. Congress is, properly, a\r\ndeliberative corps; and it forgets itself when it attempts to play the\r\nexecutive. It is impossible such a body, numerous as it is, constantly\r\nfluctuating, can ever act with sufficient decision, or with system.\r\nTwo-thirds of the members, one half the time, cannot know what has\r\ngone before them, or what connection the subject in hand has to what\r\nhas been transacted on former occasions. The members who have been\r\nmore permanent, will only give information that promotes the side they\r\nespouse in the present case; and will as often mislead as enlighten.\r\nThe variety of business must distract; and the proneness of every\r\nassembly to debate, must at all times delay.\r\n\r\nLately, Congress, convinced of these inconveniences, have gone into the\r\nmeasure of appointing Boards. But this is, in my opinion, a bad plan.\r\n\r\nA single man, in each department of the administration, would be\r\ngreatly preferable. It would give us a chance of more knowledge, more\r\nactivity, more responsibility, and, of course, more zeal and attention.\r\nBoards partake of a part of the inconveniences of larger assemblies.\r\nTheir decisions are slower, their energy less, their responsibility\r\nmore diffused. They will not have the same abilities and knowledge as\r\nan administration by single men. Men of the first pretensions will not\r\nso readily engage in them; because they will be less conspicuous, of\r\nless importance, have less opportunity of distinguishing themselves.\r\nThe members of Boards will take less pains to inform themselves and\r\narrive to eminence, because they have fewer motives to do it. All\r\nthese reasons conspire to give a preference to the plan of vesting the\r\ngreat executive departments of the State in the hands of individuals.\r\nAs these men will be, of course, at all times under the direction of\r\nCongress, we shall blend the advantages of a Monarchy and Republic in\r\nour constitution.\r\n\r\nA question has been made, whether single men could be found to\r\nundertake these offices. I think they could; because there would be\r\nthen every thing to excite the ambition of candidates. But, in order\r\nto this, Congress, by their manner of appointing them, and the line of\r\nduty marked out, must show that they are in earnest in making these\r\nofficers, officers of real trust and importance.\r\n\r\nI fear a little vanity has stood in the way of these arrangements, as\r\nthough they would lessen the importance of Congress, and leave them\r\nnothing to do. But they would have precisely the same rights and powers\r\nas heretofore, happily disencumbered of the detail. They would have to\r\ninspect the conduct of their ministers, deliberate upon their plans,\r\noriginate others for the public good; only observing this rule: that\r\nthey ought to consult their ministers, and get all the information and\r\nadvice they could from them, before they entered into any new measures,\r\nor made changes in the old.\r\n\r\nA third defect is, the fluctuating constitution of our army. This\r\nhas been a pregnant source of evil: all our military misfortunes,\r\nthree-fourths of our civil embarrassments, are to be ascribed to it.\r\nThe General has so fully enumerated the mischiefs of it, in a letter of\r\nthe      , to Congress, that I could only repeat what he has said, and\r\nwill therefore refer you to that letter.\r\n\r\nThe imperfect and unequal provision made for the army, is a fourth\r\ndefect, which you will find delineated in the same letter. Without a\r\nspeedy change, the army must dissolve. It is now a mob, rather than an\r\narmy; without clothing, without pay, without provision, without morals,\r\nwithout discipline. We begin to hate the country for its neglect of\r\nus. The country begin to hate us for our oppressions of them. Congress\r\nhave long been jealous of us. We have now lost all confidence in them,\r\nand give the worst construction to all they do. Held together by the\r\nslenderest ties, we are ripening for a dissolution.\r\n\r\nThe present mode of supplying the army, by State purchases, is not one\r\nof the least considerable defects of our system. It is too precarious\r\na dependence; because the States will never be sufficiently impressed\r\nwith our necessities. Each will make its own ease a primary object; the\r\nsupply of the army a secondary one. The variety of channels through\r\nwhich the business is transacted, will multiply the number of persons\r\nemployed, and the opportunities of embezzling public money. From the\r\npopular spirit on which most of the Governments turn, the State agents\r\nwill be men of less character and ability: nor will there be so rigid\r\na responsibility among them, as there might easily be among those in\r\nthe employ of the Continent; of course, not so much diligence, care, or\r\neconomy. Very little of the money raised in the several States, will go\r\ninto the Continental treasury, on pretence, that it is all exhausted in\r\nproviding the quotas of supplies; and the public will be without funds\r\nfor the other demands of Government. The expense will be ultimately\r\nmuch greater, and the advantages much smaller. We actually feel the\r\ninsufficiency of this plan; and have reason to dread, under it, a\r\nruinous extremity of want.\r\n\r\nThese are the principal defects, in the present system, that now occur\r\nto me. There are many inferior ones, in the organization of particular\r\ndepartments, and many errors of administration, which might be pointed\r\nout; but the task would be troublesome and tedious: and if we had once\r\nremedied those I have mentioned, the others would not be attended with\r\nmuch difficulty.\r\n\r\nI shall now propose the remedies, which appear to me applicable to\r\nour circumstances, and necessary to extricate our affairs from their\r\npresent deplorable situation. The first step must be, to give Congress\r\npowers competent to the public exigencies. This may happen in two ways:\r\none, by resuming and exercising the discretionary powers I suppose to\r\nhave been originally vested in them, for the safety of the States;\r\nand resting their conduct on the candor of their countrymen, and\r\nthe necessity of the conjuncture: the other, by calling immediately\r\na Convention of all the States, with full authority to conclude\r\nfinally upon a General Confederation; stating to them, beforehand,\r\nexplicitly, the evils arising from a want of power in Congress, and\r\nthe impossibility of supporting the contest on its present footing;\r\nthat the delegates may come, possessed of proper sentiments, as well\r\nas proper authority, to give efficacy to the meeting. Their commission\r\nshould include a right of vesting Congress with the whole, or a\r\nproportion, of the unoccupied lands, to be employed for the purpose of\r\nraising a revenue: reserving the jurisdiction to the States by whom\r\nthey are granted.\r\n\r\nThe first plan, I expect, will be thought too bold an expedient, by the\r\ngenerality of Congress; and, indeed, their practice hitherto, has so\r\nriveted the opinion of their want of power, that the success of this\r\nexperiment may very well be doubted.\r\n\r\nI see no objection to the other mode, that has any weight, in\r\ncompetition with the reasons for it. The Convention should assemble the\r\nfirst of November next. The sooner the better. Our disorders are too\r\nviolent to admit of a common or lingering remedy. The reasons for which\r\nI require them to be vested with plenipotentiary authority, are, that\r\nthe business may suffer no delay in the execution; and may, in reality,\r\ncome to effect. A Convention may agree upon a Confederation: the\r\nStates, individually, hardly ever will. We must have one at all events,\r\nand a vigorous one, if we mean to succeed in the contest, and be happy\r\nhereafter. As I said before, to engage the States to comply with this\r\nmode, Congress ought to confess to them, plainly and unanimously, the\r\nimpracticability of supporting our affairs on the present footing, and\r\nwithout a solid coercive union. I ask, that the Convention should have\r\na power of vesting the whole, or a part, of the unoccupied lands in\r\nCongress; because it is necessary that body should have some property,\r\nas a fund for the arrangements of finance; and I know of no other kind\r\nthat can be given them.\r\n\r\nThe Confederation, in my opinion, should give Congress complete\r\nsovereignty; except as to that part of internal police, which relates\r\nto the rights of property and life among individuals, and to raising\r\nmoney by internal taxes. It is necessary that every thing belonging\r\nto this, should be regulated by the State legislatures. Congress\r\nshould have complete sovereignty in all that relates to war, peace,\r\ntrade, finance; and to the management of foreign affairs; the right of\r\ndeclaring war; of raising armies, officering, paying them, directing\r\ntheir motions in every respect; of equipping fleets, and doing the same\r\nwith them; of building fortifications, arsenals, magazines, etc., etc.;\r\nof making peace on such conditions as they think proper; of regulating\r\ntrade, determining with what countries it shall be carried on; granting\r\nindulgencies; laying prohibitions on all the articles of export, or\r\nimport; imposing duties; granting bounties and premiums for raising,\r\nexporting, or importing, and applying to their own use, the product of\r\nthese duties; only giving credit to the States on whom they are raised,\r\nin the general account of revenues and expenses; instituting Admiralty\r\nCourts, etc.; of coining money; establishing Banks on such terms, and\r\nwith such privileges, as they think proper; appropriating funds, and\r\ndoing whatever else relates to the operations of finance; transacting\r\nevery thing with foreign nations; making alliances, offensive and\r\ndefensive; treaties of commerce, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nThe Confederation should provide certain perpetual revenues,\r\nproductive, and easy of collection; a land tax, poll tax, or the like;\r\nwhich, together with the duties on trade, and the unlocated lands,\r\nwould give Congress a substantial existence, and a stable foundation\r\nfor their schemes of finance. What more supplies were necessary, should\r\nbe occasionally demanded of the States, in the present mode of quotas.\r\n\r\nThe second step I would recommend, is, that Congress should instantly\r\nappoint the following great officers of State. A Secretary for Foreign\r\nAffairs, a President of War, a President of Marine, a Financier, a\r\nPresident of Trade. Instead of this last, a Board of Trade may be\r\npreferable, as the regulations of trade are slow and gradual; and\r\nrequire prudence and experience more than other qualities; for which\r\nBoards are very well adapted.\r\n\r\nCongress should choose for these offices, men of the first abilities,\r\nproperty, and character, in the Continent; and such as have had the\r\nbest opportunities of being acquainted with the several branches.\r\nGeneral Schuyler, whom you mentioned, would make an excellent President\r\nof War; General M’Dougall a very good President of Marine. Mr. Robert\r\nMorris would have many things in his favor for the department of\r\nfinance. He could, by his own personal influence, give great weight to\r\nthe measures he should adopt. I dare say men, equally capable, may be\r\nfound for the other departments.\r\n\r\nI know not if it would not be a good plan to let the Financier be\r\nPresident of the Board of Trade; but he should only have a casting\r\nvoice in determining questions there. There is a connection between\r\ntrade and finance, which ought to make the director of one acquainted\r\nwith the other; but the Financier should not direct the affairs of\r\ntrade, because, for the sake of acquiring reputation by increasing the\r\nrevenues, he might adopt measures that would depress trade. In what\r\nrelates to finance, he should be alone.\r\n\r\nThese officers should have nearly the same powers and functions as\r\nthose in France analogous to them: and each should be Chief in his\r\ndepartment; with subordinate Boards, composed of assistants, clerks,\r\netc., to execute his orders.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, a plan of this kind would be of inconceivable utility to\r\nour affairs: its benefits would be very speedily felt. It would give\r\nnew life and energy to the operations of Government. Business would be\r\nconducted with dispatch, method, and system. A million of abuses, now\r\nexisting, would be corrected; and judicious plans would be formed and\r\nexecuted for the public good.\r\n\r\nAnother step of immediate necessity, is, to recruit the army for the\r\nwar, or at least for three years. This must be done by a mode similar\r\nto that which is practised in Sweden. There the inhabitants are thrown\r\ninto classes of sixteen; and when the sovereign wants men, each of\r\nthese classes must furnish one. They raise a fixed sum of money; and\r\nif one of the class is willing to become a soldier, he receives the\r\nmoney and offers himself a volunteer. If none is found to do this, a\r\ndraught is made; and he on whom the lot falls, receives the money, and\r\nis obliged to serve.\r\n\r\nThe minds of the people are prepared for a thing of this kind. The\r\nheavy bounties they have been obliged to pay for men to serve a few\r\nmonths, must have disgusted them with this mode, and made them desirous\r\nof another, that will, once for all, answer the public purposes, and\r\nobviate a repetition of the demand. It ought, by all means, to be\r\nattempted; and Congress should frame a general plan, and press the\r\nexecution upon the States.\r\n\r\nWhen the Confederation comes to be framed, it ought to provide for this\r\nby a fundamental law; and hereafter there would be no doubt of the\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nBut we cannot now wait for this. We want to replace the men whose times\r\nof service will expire the first of January: for then, without this, we\r\nshall have no army remaining; and the enemy may do what they please.\r\nThe General, in his letter already quoted, has assigned the most\r\nsubstantial reasons for paying immediate attention to this point.\r\n\r\nCongress should endeavor, both upon their credit in Europe, and\r\nby every possible exertion in this country, to provide clothing\r\nfor their officers; and should abolish the whole system of State\r\nsupplies. The making good the depreciation of the currency, and all\r\nother compensations to the army, should be immediately taken up by\r\nCongress, and not left to the States. If they would have the accounts\r\nof depreciation liquidated, and governmental certificates given for\r\nwhat is due, in specie, or an equivalent to specie, it would give\r\nsatisfaction; appointing periodical settlements for future depreciation.\r\n\r\nThe placing the officers upon half-pay during life, would be a great\r\nstroke of policy; and would give Congress a stronger tie upon them\r\nthan any thing else they can do. No man, that reflects a moment,\r\nbut will prefer a permanent provision of this kind to any temporary\r\ncompensation. Nor is it opposed to economy: the difference between\r\nthis, and between what has already been done, will be insignificant.\r\nThe benefit of it to the widows should be confined to those whose\r\nhusbands die during the war. As to the survivors, not more than one\r\nhalf, on the usual calculation of men’s lives, will exceed the seven\r\nyears for which the half-pay is already established. Beside this,\r\nwhatever may be the visionary speculations of some men at this time,\r\nwe shall find it indispensable, after the war, to keep on foot a\r\nconsiderable body of troops: and all the officers, retained for this\r\npurpose, must be deducted out of the half-pay list. If any one will\r\ntake the pains to calculate the expense of these principles, I am\r\npersuaded he will find the addition of expense, from the establishment\r\nproposed, by no means a national object.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of securing the attachment of the army to Congress, and\r\nbinding them to the service by substantial ties, are immense. We should\r\nthen have discipline; an army in reality, as well as in name. Congress\r\nwould then have a solid basis of authority and consequence: for, to me,\r\nit is an axiom, that in our constitution, an army is essential to the\r\nAmerican Union.\r\n\r\nThe providing of supplies, is the pivot of every thing else (though a\r\nwell-constituted army would, not in a small degree, conduce to this, by\r\ngiving consistency and weight to Government). There are four ways, all\r\nof which must be united: A foreign loan; heavy pecuniary taxes; a tax\r\nin kind; a Bank founded on public and private credit.\r\n\r\nAs to a foreign loan, I dare say Congress are doing every thing in\r\ntheir power to obtain it. The most effectual way will be to tell\r\nFrance, that, without it, we must make terms with Great Britain.\r\nThis must be done with plainness and firmness; but with respect, and\r\nwithout petulance; not as a menace, but as a candid declaration of our\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nWe need not fear to be deserted by France. Her interest and honor\r\nare too deeply involved in our fate; and she can make no possible\r\ncompromise. She can assist us, if she is convinced it is absolutely\r\nnecessary; either by lending us, herself, or by becoming our surety,\r\nor by influencing Spain. It has been to me astonishing, how any man\r\ncould have doubted, at any period of our affairs, of the necessity of\r\na foreign loan. It was self-evident, that we had not a fund of wealth\r\nin this country capable of affording revenues equal to the expenses. We\r\nmust then create artificial revenues, or borrow. The first was done;\r\nbut it ought to have been foreseen that the expedient could not last,\r\nand we should have provided in time for its failure.\r\n\r\nHere was an error of Congress. I have good reason to believe, that\r\nmeasures were not taken, in earnest, early enough to procure a loan\r\nabroad. I give you my honor, that from our first outset, I thought as\r\nI do now, and wished for a foreign loan; not only because I foresaw\r\nit would be essential, but because I considered it as a tie upon the\r\nnation from which it was derived, and as a mean to prop our cause in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nConcerning the necessity of heavy pecuniary taxes, I need say nothing;\r\nas it is a point in which every body is agreed. Nor is there any\r\ndanger, that the product of any taxes, raised in this way, will\r\noverburthen the people, or exceed the wants of the public. Indeed, if\r\nall the paper in circulation were drawn annually into the treasury, it\r\nwould neither do one nor the other.\r\n\r\nAs to a tax in kind, the necessity of it results from this principle:\r\nthat the money in circulation is not a sufficient representative of\r\nthe productions of the country; and, consequently, no revenues, raised\r\nfrom it as a medium, can be a competent representative of that part\r\nof the products of the country which it is bound to contribute to\r\nthe support of the public. The public, therefore, to obtain its due,\r\nor satisfy its just demands, and its wants, must call for a part of\r\nthose products themselves. This is done in all those countries which\r\nare not commercial: in Russia, Prussia, Denmark, Sweden, etc., and is\r\npeculiarly necessary in our case.\r\n\r\nCongress, in calling for specific supplies, seem to have had this\r\nin view; but their intention has not been answered. The States, in\r\ngeneral, have undertaken to furnish supplies by purchase; a mode, as I\r\nhave observed, attended with every inconvenience, and subverting the\r\nprinciple on which the supplies were demanded; the insufficiency of our\r\ncirculating medium as a representative for the labor and commodities\r\nof the country. It is therefore necessary that Congress should be more\r\nexplicit; should form the outlines of a plan for a tax in kind, and\r\nrecommend it to the States as a measure of absolute necessity.\r\n\r\nThe general idea I have of a plan, is, that a respectable man should\r\nbe appointed by the State, in each county, to collect the taxes\r\nand form magazines; that Congress should have, in each State, an\r\nofficer to superintend the whole; and that the State collectors\r\nshould be subordinate and responsible to them. This Continental\r\nSuperintendent might be subject to the general direction of the\r\nQuarter-Master-General, or not, as might be deemed best; but if not\r\nsubject to him, he should be obliged to make monthly returns to\r\nthe President at War, who should instruct him what proportion to\r\ndeliver to the Quarter-Master-General. It may be necessary, that the\r\nSuperintendents should sometimes have power to dispose of the articles\r\nin their possession, on public account; for it would happen, that the\r\ncontributions, in places remote from the army, could not be transported\r\nto the theatre of operations without too great expense; in which case\r\nit would be eligible to dispose of them, and purchase, with the money\r\nso raised, in the countries near the immediate scene of war.\r\n\r\nI know the objections which may be raised to this plan; its tendency\r\nto discourage industry, and the like. But necessity calls for it. We\r\ncannot proceed without it: and less evils must give place to greater.\r\nIt is, besides, practised with success in other countries, and why not\r\nin this? It may be said, the examples cited are from nations under\r\ndespotic governments; and that the same would not be practicable with\r\nus. But I contend, where the public good is evidently the object, more\r\nmay be effected in governments like ours, than in any other. It has\r\nbeen a constant remark, that free countries have ever paid the heaviest\r\ntaxes. The obedience of a free people to general laws, however hard\r\nthey bear, is ever more perfect than that of slaves to the arbitrary\r\nwill of a prince. To this may be added, that Sweden was always a free\r\ngovernment; and is so now, in a great degree, notwithstanding the late\r\nrevolution. How far it may be practicable to erect a Bank on the\r\njoint credit of the public and of individuals, can only be certainly\r\ndetermined by the experiment. But it is of so much importance, that the\r\nexperiment ought to be fully tried. When I saw the subscriptions going\r\non to the Bank established for supplying the army, I was in hopes it\r\nwas only the embryo of a more permanent and extensive establishment.\r\nBut I have reason to believe I shall be disappointed. It does not seem\r\nto be at all conducted on the true principles of a Bank.\r\n\r\nThe Directors of it are purchasing with their Stock, instead of Bank\r\nnotes, as I expected: in consequence of which, it must turn out to be a\r\nmere subscription of a particular sum of money for a particular purpose.\r\n\r\nPaper credit never was long supported in any country, on a national\r\nscale, where it was not founded on a joint basis of public and private\r\ncredit. An attempt to establish it on public credit alone, in France,\r\nunder the auspices of Mr. Law, had nearly ruined the kingdom. We have\r\nseen the effects of it in America; and every successive experiment,\r\nproves the futility of the attempt. Our new money is depreciating\r\nalmost as fast as the old; though it has, in some States, as real funds\r\nas paper money ever had. The reason is, that the moneyed men have not\r\nan immediate interest to uphold its credit. They may even, in many\r\nways, find it their interest to undermine it. The only certain manner\r\nto obtain a permanent paper credit, is to engage the moneyed interest\r\nimmediately in it, by making them contribute the whole, or part of the\r\nStock, and giving them the whole, or part of the profits.\r\n\r\nThe invention of Banks, on the modern principle, originated in Venice.\r\nThere the public, and a Company of moneyed men, are mutually concerned.\r\nThe Bank of England unites public authority and faith with private\r\ncredit: and hence we see, what a vast fabric of paper credit is raised\r\non a visionary basis. Had it not been for this, England would never\r\nhave found sufficient funds to carry on her wars: but, with the help\r\nof this, she has done, and is doing, wonders. The Bank of Amsterdam is\r\non a similar foundation. And why can we not have an American Bank?\r\nAre our moneyed men less enlightened to their own interest, or less\r\nenterprising in the pursuit? I believe the fault is in Government,\r\nwhich does not exert itself to engage them in such a scheme. It is\r\ntrue, the individuals in America are not very rich; but this would not\r\nprevent their instituting a Bank; it would only prevent its being done\r\nwith such ample funds as in other countries. Have they not sufficient\r\nconfidence in the Government, and in the issue of the cause? Let\r\nthe Government endeavor to inspire that confidence, by adopting the\r\nmeasures I have recommended, or others equivalent to them. Let it\r\nexert itself to procure a solid Confederation; to establish a good\r\nplan of executive administration; to form a permanent military force;\r\nto obtain, at all events, a foreign loan. If these things were in a\r\ntrain of vigorous execution, it would give a new spring to our affairs;\r\nGovernment would recover its respectability, and individuals would\r\nrenounce their diffidence.\r\n\r\nThe object I should propose to myself, in the first instance, from\r\na Bank, would be an auxiliary mode of supplies; for which purpose,\r\ncontracts should be made, between Government and the Bank, on terms\r\nliberal and advantageous to the latter. Every thing should be done,\r\nin the first instance, to encourage the Bank. After it gets well\r\nestablished, it will take care of itself; and Government may make the\r\nbest terms it can, for itself.\r\n\r\nThe first step to establishing the Bank, will be to engage a number of\r\nmoneyed men of influence to relish the project, and make it a business.\r\nThe subscribers to that lately established, are the fittest persons\r\nthat can be found; and their plan may be interwoven.\r\n\r\nThe outlines of my plan would be, to open subscriptions in all the\r\nStates; for the Stock, which we will suppose to be one million of\r\npounds. Real property of every kind, as well as specie, should be\r\ndeemed good Stock; but at least a fourth part of the subscription\r\nshould be in specie, or plate. There should be one great Company, in\r\nthree divisions: in Virginia, Philadelphia, and at Boston; or two at\r\nPhiladelphia and Boston. The Bank should have a right to issue Bank\r\nnotes, bearing two per cent. interest, for the whole of their stock;\r\nbut not to exceed it. These notes may be payable every three months, or\r\noftener: and the faith of government must be pledged for the support of\r\nthe Bank. It must therefore have a right, from time to time, to inspect\r\nits operations, and must appoint inspectors for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of the Bank may consist in this: in the profits of\r\nthe contracts made with Government, which should bear interest to\r\nbe annually paid in specie; in the loan of money at interest, say\r\nsix per cent.; in purchasing lives by annuities, as practised in\r\nEngland, etc. The benefit resulting to the Company, is evident from\r\nthe consideration, that they may employ, in circulation, a great\r\ndeal more money than they have specie in Stock, on the credit of the\r\nreal property which they will have in other use. This money will be\r\nemployed, either in fulfilling their contracts with the public, by\r\nwhich also they will gain a profit; or in loans at an advantageous\r\ninterest, or in annuities.\r\n\r\nThe Bank may be allowed to purchase plate and bullion, and coin money;\r\nallowing Government a part of the profit. I make the Bank notes bear\r\ninterest, to obtain a readier currency, and to induce the holders to\r\nprefer them to specie, to prevent too great a run upon the Bank, at any\r\ntime, beyond its ability to pay.\r\n\r\nIf Government can obtain a foreign loan, it should lend to the Bank,\r\non easy terms, to extend its influence, and facilitate a compliance\r\nwith its engagements. If Government could engage the States to raise\r\na sum of money in specie, to be deposited in Bank in the same manner,\r\nit would be of the greatest consequence. If Government could prevail\r\non the enthusiasm of the people, to make a contribution in plate for\r\nthe same purpose, it would be a master-stroke. Things of this kind\r\nsometimes succeed in popular contests; and, if undertaken with address,\r\nI should not despair of its success: but I should not be sanguine.\r\n\r\nThe Bank may be instituted for a term of years by way of trial; and the\r\nparticular privilege of coining money, be for a term still shorter.\r\nA temporary transfer of it to a particular Company, can have no\r\ninconvenience, as the Government are in no condition to improve this\r\nresource; nor could it, in our circumstances, be an object to them;\r\nthough, with the industry of a knot of individuals, it might be a\r\nvaluable one to them. A Bank of this kind, even in its commencement,\r\nwould answer the most valuable purposes to Government and to the\r\nproprietors: in its progress, the advantages will exceed calculation.\r\nIt will promote commerce, by furnishing a more extensive medium, which\r\nwe greatly want, in our circumstances. I mean a more extensive valuable\r\nmedium. We have an enormous nominal one at this time, but it is only a\r\nname.\r\n\r\nIn the present unsettled state of things in this country, we can hardly\r\ndraw inferences from what has happened in others; otherwise I should be\r\ncertain of the success of this scheme: but I think it has enough in its\r\nfavor to be worthy of trial.\r\n\r\nI have only skimmed the surface of the different subjects I have\r\nintroduced. Should the plans recommended come into contemplation, in\r\nearnest, and you desire my further thoughts, I will endeavor to give\r\nthem more form and particularity. I am persuaded a solid Confederation,\r\na permanent army, a reasonable prospect of subsisting it, would give us\r\ntreble consideration in Europe, and produce a peace this winter.\r\n\r\nIf a Convention is called, the minds of all the States, and the people,\r\nought to be prepared to receive its determinations by sensible and\r\npopular writings, which should conform to the views of Congress. There\r\nare epochs in human affairs when _novelty_ even is useful. If a general\r\nopinion prevails that the old way is bad, whether true or false, and\r\nthis obstructs or relaxes the operations of the public service, a\r\nchange is necessary, if it be but for the sake of change. This is\r\nexactly the case now. ’Tis a universal sentiment, that our present\r\nsystem is a bad one, and that things do not go right on this account.\r\nThe measure of a Convention would revive the hopes of the people,\r\nand give a new direction to their passions, which may be improved in\r\ncarrying points of substantial utility. The eastern States have already\r\npointed out this mode to Congress: they ought to take the hint and\r\nanticipate the others.\r\n\r\nAnd, in future, my dear sir, two things let me recommend, as\r\nfundamental rules for the conduct of Congress: to attach the army to\r\nthem by every motive; to maintain an air of authority (not domineering)\r\nin all their measures with the States. The manner in which a thing is\r\ndone, has more influence than is commonly imagined. Men are governed\r\nby opinion: this opinion is as much influenced by appearances as by\r\nrealities. If a Government appears to be confident of its own powers,\r\nit is the surest way to inspire the same confidence in others. If it is\r\ndiffident, it may be certain there will be a still greater diffidence\r\nin others; and that its authority will not only be distrusted,\r\ncontroverted, but contemned.\r\n\r\nI wish, too, Congress would always consider, that a kindness\r\nconsists as much in the manner as in the thing. The best things done\r\nhesitatingly, and with an ill grace, lose their effect, and produce\r\ndisgust rather than satisfaction or gratitude. In what Congress have at\r\nany time done for the army, they have commonly been too late. They have\r\nseemed to yield to importunity, rather than to sentiments of justice or\r\nto a regard to the accommodation of their troops. An attention to this\r\nidea, is of more importance than it may be thought. I, who have seen\r\nall the workings and progress of the present discontents, am convinced,\r\nthat a want of this has not been among the most inconsiderable causes.\r\n\r\nYou will perceive, my dear sir, this letter is hastily written, and\r\nwith a confidential freedom: not as to a member of Congress, whose\r\nfeelings may be sore at the prevailing clamors; but as to a friend, who\r\nis in a situation to remedy public disorders; who wishes for nothing so\r\nmuch as truth; and who is desirous of information, even from those less\r\ncapable of judging than himself. I have not even time to correct and\r\ncopy; and only enough to add, that I am, very truly and affectionately,\r\ndear sir,\r\n\r\n                                             Your most obedient servant,\r\n                                             A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHUYLER TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                   1780.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir:\r\n\r\nYour favor of the 17th I received on that day. That of the 13th has\r\ntaken a tour to Albany and was delivered me this moment.\r\n\r\nCommissioners will be appointed to meet the Eastern Convention; I\r\nbelieve Judge Hubbard, Mr. Benson, the Attorney General, and myself,\r\nwill go; the two gentlemen I have mentioned are as deeply impressed as\r\nmen can be with the necessity of more power in the directing councils,\r\nor what would be better in our present situation, ----. The lower house\r\nare for it, but the upper timid, although heartily disposed to every\r\nmeasure which will give vigor.\r\n\r\nI was too much indisposed to undertake the journey to Hartford,\r\nand continue so much so that I am obliged to quit this before the\r\nLegislature rises.\r\n\r\nI am informed Gates is to have the thanks of the Senate for not\r\ndespairing of the Commonwealth, but that they do not mean to tread\r\nwholly in the steps of the Romans, and confine him to subordinate\r\ncommands; he is to have a potent army, and to drive Cornwallis and his\r\ncrew into the sea with more rapidity than he flew to Hillsborough.\r\n\r\nPray entreat the General and the gentlemen of his family to accept of\r\nmy best wishes, in which you always partake.\r\n\r\n                                             I am, dear Sir,\r\n                                             Affectionately yours, etc.,\r\n                                             P. Schuyler.\r\n\r\nCol. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO MISS SCHUYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                      September 6, 1780.\r\n\r\nMost people here are groaning under a very disagreeable piece of\r\nintelligence just come from the southward, that Gates has had a total\r\ndefeat near Camden, in South Carolina. Cornwallis and he met in the\r\nnight of the fifteenth, by accident, marching to the same point. The\r\nadvanced guards skirmished, and the two armies halted and formed till\r\nmorning. In the morning a battle ensued, in which the militia, and\r\nGates with them, immediately ran away, and left the Continental troops\r\nto contend with the enemy’s whole force.\r\n\r\nThey did it obstinately, and probably are most of them cut off. Gates,\r\nhowever, who writes to Congress, seems to know very little what has\r\nbecome of his army. He showed that age and the long labors and fatigues\r\nof a military life had not in the least impaired his activity, for in\r\nthree days and a half he reached Hillsborough, one hundred and eighty\r\nmiles from the scene of action, leaving all his troops to take care of\r\nthemselves, and get out of the scrape as well as they could.\r\n\r\nHe has confirmed, in this instance, the opinion I always had of him.\r\nThis event will have very serious consequences to the southward.\r\nPeople’s imaginations have already given up North Carolina and\r\nVirginia; but I do not believe either of them will fall. I am certain\r\nVirginia cannot. This misfortune affects me less than others, because\r\nit is not in my temper to repine at evils that are past, but to\r\nendeavor to draw good out of them, and because I think our safety\r\ndepends on a total change of system, and this change of system will\r\nonly be produced by misfortune.\r\n\r\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO DUANE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                      September 6, 1780.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir:\r\n\r\nThe letter accompanying this has lain by two or three days for want\r\nof an opportunity. I have heard since of Gates’s defeat: a very good\r\ncomment on the necessity of changing our system. His passion for\r\nmilitia, I fancy, will be a little cured, and he will cease to think\r\nthem the best bulwark of American liberty. What think you of the\r\nconduct of this great man? I am his enemy personally, for unjust and\r\nunprovoked attacks upon my character; therefore what I say of him ought\r\nto be received as from an enemy, and have no more weight than as it\r\nis consistent with fact and common sense. But did ever any one hear\r\nof such a disposition or such a flight? His best troops placed on the\r\nside strongest by nature, his worst on that weakest by nature, and\r\nhis attack made with these. ’Tis impossible to give a more complete\r\npicture of military absurdity. It is equally against the maxims of\r\nwar and common sense. We see the consequences. His left ran away, and\r\nleft his right uncovered. His right wing turned on the left has in all\r\nprobability been cut off. Though, in truth, the General seems to have\r\nknown very little what became of his army.\r\n\r\nHad he placed his militia on his right, supported by the morass,\r\nand his Continental troops on his left, where it seems he was most\r\nvulnerable, his right would have been more secure, and his left would\r\nhave opposed the enemy; and instead of going backward when he ordered\r\nto attack, would have gone forward. The reverse of what has happened\r\nmight have happened.\r\n\r\nBut was there ever an instance of a General running away, as Gates\r\nhas done, from his whole army? And was there ever so precipitous a\r\nflight? One hundred and eighty miles in three days and a half. It does\r\nadmirable credit to the activity of a man at his time of life. But it\r\ndisgraces the General and the soldier. I always believed him to be very\r\nfar short of a Hector, or a Ulysses. All the world, I think, will begin\r\nto agree with me.\r\n\r\nBut what will be done by Congress? Will he be changed or not? If he is\r\nchanged, for God’s sake overcome prejudice, and send Greene. You know\r\nmy opinion of him. I stake my reputation on the events, give him but\r\nfair play.\r\n\r\nBut, above all things, let us have, without delay, a vigorous,\r\ngovernment, and a well constituted army for the war.\r\n\r\n                                                   Adieu, my dear Sir,\r\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOL. FLEURY TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     Boston, September 7, 1780.\r\n\r\nIf you do write to me, direct your letters to General Heath, and under\r\nhis cover. I cannot tell why till I see you; I want it much.\r\n\r\nThe enemy have left Martha’s Vineyard. It is reported they sailed to\r\nthe southward.\r\n\r\nI beg you would remember me to my friend Laurens; I have written to\r\nhim, but he keeps silent.\r\n\r\nI do not like your situation at Lee’s Fort: you throw the glove to\r\nClinton; he will take it, and we are not near enough to be your\r\nseconds. Our sick increase; not much; but they increase.\r\n\r\n                                      Farewell, your servant and friend,\r\n                                      F * * y.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO LAURENS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                        September, 1780.\r\n\r\nSince my return from Hartford, my dear Laurens, my mind has been too\r\nlittle at ease to permit me to write to you sooner. It has been wholly\r\noccupied by the affecting and tragic consequences of Arnold’s treason.\r\nMy feelings were never put to so severe a trial. You will no doubt\r\nhave heard the principal facts before this reaches you. But there are\r\nparticulars, to which my situation gave me access, that cannot have\r\ncome to your knowledge from public report, which I am persuaded you\r\nwill find interesting.\r\n\r\nFrom several circumstances, the project seems to have originated\r\nwith Arnold himself, and to have been long premeditated. The first\r\noverture is traced back to some time in June last. It was conveyed in\r\na letter to Colonel Robinson; the substance of which was, that the\r\ningratitude he had experienced from his country, concurring with other\r\ncauses, had entirely changed his principles; that he now only sought\r\nto restore himself to the favor of his king, by some signal proof of\r\nhis repentance; and would be happy to open a correspondence with Sir\r\nHenry Clinton for that purpose. About this period he made a journey to\r\nConnecticut: on his return from which to Philadelphia, he solicited\r\nthe command of West Point; alleging that the effects of his wounds had\r\ndisqualified him for the active duties of the field. The sacrifice of\r\nthis important post was the atonement he intended to make. General\r\nWashington hesitated the less to gratify an officer who had rendered\r\nsuch eminent services, as he was convinced the post might be safely\r\nintrusted to one who had given so many distinguished specimens of his\r\nbravery. In the beginning of August he joined the army and renewed his\r\napplication. The enemy, at this juncture, had embarked the greatest\r\npart of their forces on an expedition to Rhode Island; and our army was\r\nin motion to compel them to relinquish the enterprise, or to attack\r\nNew-York in its weakened state. The General offered Arnold the left\r\nwing of the army, which he declined, on the pretext already mentioned,\r\nbut not without visible embarrassment. He certainly might have executed\r\nthe duties of such a temporary command; and it was expected from his\r\nenterprising temper, that he would gladly have embraced so splendid an\r\nopportunity. But he did not choose to be diverted a moment from his\r\nfavorite object; probably from an apprehension that some different\r\ndisposition might have taken place, which would have excluded him. The\r\nextreme solicitude he discovered to get possession of the post, would\r\nhave led to a suspicion of treachery, had it been possible, from his\r\npast conduct, to have supposed him capable of it.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence thus begun, was carried on between Arnold and Major\r\nAndré, Adjutant-General to the British army, in behalf of Sir Henry\r\nClinton, under feigned signatures, and in a mercantile disguise. In\r\nan intercepted letter of Arnold’s, which lately fell into our hands,\r\nhe proposes an interview, “to settle the risks and profits of the\r\ncopartnership;” and, in the same style of metaphor, intimates an\r\nexpected augmentation of the garrison; and speaks of it as the means\r\nof extending their traffic. It appears, by another letter, that André\r\nwas to have met him on the lines, under the sanction of a flag, in the\r\ncharacter of Mr. John Anderson. But some cause or other, not known,\r\nprevented this interview.\r\n\r\nThe twentieth of last month, Robinson and André went up the river\r\nin the Vulture sloop-of-war. Robinson sent a flag to Arnold with\r\ntwo letters; one to General Putnam, inclosed in another to himself;\r\nproposing an interview with Putnam, or, in his absence, with Arnold, to\r\nadjust some private concerns. The one to General Putnam, was evidently\r\nmeant as a cover to the other, in case, by accident, the letters should\r\nhave fallen under the inspection of a third person.\r\n\r\nGeneral Washington crossed the river, on his way to Hartford, the day\r\nthese dispatches arrived. Arnold, conceiving he must have heard of the\r\nflag, thought it necessary, for the sake of appearances, to submit the\r\nletters to him, and ask his opinion of the propriety of complying with\r\nthe request. The General, with his usual caution, though without the\r\nleast surmise of the design, dissuaded him from it, and advised him\r\nto reply to Robinson, that whatever related to his private affairs,\r\nmust be of a civil nature, and could only properly be addressed to the\r\ncivil authority. This reference fortunately deranged the plan; and was\r\nthe first link in the chain of events that led to the detection. The\r\ninterview could no longer take place in the form of a flag, but was\r\nobliged to be managed in a secret manner.\r\n\r\nArnold employed one Smith to go on board the Vulture the night of\r\nthe twenty-second, to bring André on shore, with a pass for Mr. John\r\nAnderson. André came ashore accordingly; and was conducted within a\r\npicket of ours to the house of Smith, where Arnold and he remained\r\ntogether in close conference all that night and the day following.\r\nAt daylight in the morning, the commanding officer at King’s Ferry,\r\nwithout the privity of Arnold, moved a couple of pieces of cannon to\r\na point opposite to where the Vulture lay, and obliged her to take a\r\nmore remote station. This event, or some lurking distrust, made the\r\nboatmen refuse to convey the two passengers back, and disconcerted\r\nArnold so much, that by one of those strokes of infatuation which\r\noften confound the schemes of men conscious of guilt, he insisted on\r\nAndré’s exchanging his uniform for a disguise, and returning in a mode\r\ndifferent from that in which he came. André, who had been undesignedly\r\nbrought within our posts in the first instance, remonstrated warmly\r\nagainst this new and dangerous expedient. But Arnold persisting in\r\ndeclaring it impossible for him to return as he came, he at length\r\nreluctantly yielded to his direction, and consented to change his\r\ndress, and take the route he recommended. Smith furnished the disguise,\r\nand in the evening passed King’s Ferry with him, and proceeded to\r\nCrompond, where they stopped the remainder of the night, at the\r\ninstance of a militia officer, to avoid being suspected by him. The\r\nnext morning they resumed their journey, Smith accompanying André\r\na little beyond Pine’s Bridge, where he left him. He had reached\r\nTarrytown, when he was taken up by three militia men, who rushed out of\r\nthe woods and seized his horse.\r\n\r\nAt this critical moment, his presence of mind forsook him. Instead\r\nof producing his pass, which would have extricated him from our\r\nparties, and could have done him no harm with his own, he asked the\r\nmilitia men, if they were of the _upper_ or _lower_ party; distinctive\r\nappellations known among the enemy’s refugee corps. The militia men\r\nreplied, they were of the lower party; upon which he told them he\r\nwas a British officer, and pressed them not to detain him, as he was\r\nupon urgent business. This confession removed all doubts; and it was\r\nin vain he afterwards produced his pass. He was instantly forced off\r\nto a place of greater security, where, after a careful search, there\r\nwere found, concealed in the feet of his stockings, several papers\r\nof importance, delivered to him by Arnold! Among these, were a plan\r\nof the fortifications of West Point; a memorial from the engineer\r\non the attack and defence of the place; returns of the garrison,\r\ncannon, and stores; copy of the minutes of a council of war held by\r\nGeneral Washington a few weeks before. The prisoner, at first, was\r\ninadvertently ordered to Arnold; but on recollection, while still on\r\nthe way, he was countermanded, and sent to Old Salem. The papers were\r\ninclosed in a letter to General Washington, which, having taken a\r\nroute different from that by which he returned, made a circuit that\r\nafforded leisure for another letter, through an ill-judged delicacy,\r\nwritten to Arnold with information of Anderson’s capture, to get to him\r\nan hour before General Washington arrived at his quarters; time enough\r\nto elude the fate that awaited him. He went down the river in his barge\r\nto the Vulture with such precipitate confusion, that he did not take\r\nwith him a single paper useful to the enemy. On the first notice of the\r\naffair, he was pursued, but much too late to be overtaken.\r\n\r\nThere was some color for imagining it was a part of the plan to betray\r\nthe General into the hands of the enemy. Arnold was very anxious to\r\nascertain from him the precise day of his return; and the enemy’s\r\nmovements seem to have corresponded to this point. But if it was really\r\nthe case, it was very injudicious. The success must have depended\r\non surprise; and as the officers at the advanced posts were not in\r\nthe secret, their measures might have given the alarm; and General\r\nWashington, taking the command of the post, might have rendered the\r\nwhole scheme abortive. Arnold, it is true, had so dispersed the\r\ngarrison, as to have made a defence difficult, but not impracticable;\r\nand the acquisition of West Point was of such magnitude to the enemy,\r\nthat it would have been unwise to connect it with any other object,\r\nhowever great, which might make the obtaining of it precarious.\r\n\r\nArnold, a moment before the setting out, went into Mrs. Arnold’s\r\napartment, and informed her that some transactions had just come to\r\nlight, which must for ever banish him from his country. She fell\r\ninto a swoon at this declaration: and he left her in it, to consult\r\nhis own safety, till the servants, alarmed by her cries, came to her\r\nrelief. She remained frantic all day; accusing every one who approached\r\nher, with an intention to murder her child (an infant in her arms);\r\nand exhibiting every other mark of the most genuine and agonizing\r\ndistress. Exhausted by the fatigue and tumult of her spirits, her\r\nphrensy subsided towards evening, and she sank into all the sadness\r\nof affliction. It was impossible not to have been touched with her\r\nsituation. Every thing affecting in female tears, or in the misfortunes\r\nof beauty; every thing pathetic in the wounded tenderness of a wife,\r\nor in the apprehensive fondness of a mother; and, till I have reason\r\nto change the opinion, I will add, every thing amiable in suffering\r\ninnocence; conspired to make her an object of sympathy to all who\r\nwere present. She experienced the most delicate attentions, and every\r\nfriendly office, till her departure for Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nAndré was, without loss of time, conducted to the head quarters of\r\nthe army, where he was immediately brought before a Board of General\r\nOfficers, to prevent all possibility of misrepresentation, or cavil\r\non the part of the enemy. The Board reported, that he ought to be\r\nconsidered as a spy, and, according to the laws of nations, to suffer\r\ndeath; which was executed two days after.\r\n\r\nNever, perhaps, did any man suffer death with more justice, or\r\ndeserve it less. The first step he took, after his capture, was to\r\nwrite a letter to General Washington, conceived in terms of dignity\r\nwithout insolence, and apology without meanness. The scope of it was\r\nto vindicate himself from the imputation of having assumed a mean\r\ncharacter for treacherous or interested purposes; asserting that he\r\nhad been involuntarily an impostor; that contrary to his intention,\r\nwhich was to meet a person for intelligence on neutral ground, he had\r\nbeen betrayed within our posts, and forced into the vile condition\r\nof an enemy in disguise; soliciting only, that, to whatever rigor\r\npolicy might devote him, a decency of treatment might be observed,\r\ndue to a person, who, though unfortunate, had been guilty of nothing\r\ndishonorable. His request was granted in its full extent; for, in the\r\nwhole progress of the affair, he was treated with the most scrupulous\r\ndelicacy. When brought before the Board of Officers, he met with every\r\nmark of indulgence, and was required to answer no interrogatory which\r\ncould even embarrass his feelings. On his part, while he carefully\r\nconcealed every thing that might involve others, he frankly confessed\r\nall the facts relating to himself; and, upon his confession, without\r\nthe trouble of examining a witness, the Board made their Report. The\r\nmembers of it were not more impressed with the candor and firmness,\r\nmixed with a becoming sensibility, which he displayed, than he was\r\npenetrated with their liberality and politeness. He acknowledged\r\nthe generosity of the behavior towards him in every respect, but\r\nparticularly in this, in the strongest terms of manly gratitude. In\r\na conversation with a gentleman who visited him after his trial, he\r\nsaid he flattered himself he had never been illiberal; but if there\r\nwere any remains of prejudice in his mind, his present experience must\r\nobliterate them.\r\n\r\nIn one of the visits I made to him (and I saw him several times during\r\nhis confinement), he begged me to be the bearer of a request to the\r\nGeneral, for permission to send an open letter to Sir Henry Clinton.\r\n“I foresee my fate,” said he, “and though I pretend not to play the\r\nhero, or to be indifferent about life; yet I am reconciled to whatever\r\nmay happen, conscious that misfortune, not guilt, has brought it upon\r\nme. There is only one thing that disturbs my tranquillity. Sir Henry\r\nClinton has been too good to me; he has been lavish of his kindness. I\r\nam bound to him by too many obligations, and love him too well, to bear\r\nthe thought, that he should reproach himself, or that others should\r\nreproach him, on the supposition of my having conceived myself obliged,\r\nby his instructions, to run the risk I did. I would not, for the world,\r\nleave a sting in his mind that should imbitter his future days.” He\r\ncould scarce finish the sentence, bursting into tears in spite of his\r\nefforts to suppress them; and with difficulty collected himself enough\r\nafterwards to add: “I wish to be permitted to assure him, I did not act\r\nunder this impression, but submitted to a necessity imposed upon me,\r\nas contrary to my own inclination as to his orders.” His request was\r\nreadily complied with; and he wrote the letter annexed, with which I\r\ndare say you will be as much pleased as I am, both for the diction and\r\nsentiment.\r\n\r\nWhen his sentence was announced to him, he remarked, that since it\r\nwas his lot to die, there was still a choice in the mode, which would\r\nmake a material difference in his feelings; and he would be happy, if\r\npossible, to be indulged with a professional death. He made a second\r\napplication, by letter, in concise but persuasive terms. It was thought\r\nthis indulgence, being incompatible with the customs of war, could not\r\nbe granted; and it was therefore determined, in both cases, to evade an\r\nanswer, to spare him the sensations which a certain knowledge of the\r\nintended mode would inflict.\r\n\r\nIn going to the place of execution, he bowed familiarly as he\r\nwent along, to all those with whom he had been acquainted in his\r\nconfinement. A smile of complacency expressed the serene fortitude of\r\nhis mind. Arrived at the fatal spot, he asked, with some emotion, “Must\r\nI then die in this manner?” He was told it had been unavoidable. “I am\r\nreconciled to my fate,” said he, “but not to the mode.” Soon, however,\r\nrecollecting himself, he added: “It will be but a momentary pang:”\r\nand, springing upon the cart, performed the last offices to himself,\r\nwith a composure that excited the admiration, and melted the hearts\r\nof the beholders. Upon being told the final moment was at hand, and\r\nasked if he had any thing to say, he answered, “Nothing but to request\r\nyou will witness to the world, that I die like a brave man.” Among the\r\nextraordinary circumstances that attended him, in the midst of his\r\nenemies, he died universally esteemed and universally regretted.\r\n\r\nThere was something singularly interesting in the character and\r\nfortunes of André. To an excellent understanding, well improved by\r\neducation and travel, he united a peculiar elegance of mind and\r\nmanners, and the advantage of a pleasing person. ’Tis said he possessed\r\na pretty taste for the fine arts, and had himself attained some\r\nproficiency in poetry, music, and painting. His knowledge appeared\r\nwithout ostentation, and embellished by a diffidence that rarely\r\naccompanies so many talents and accomplishments: which left you to\r\nsuppose more than appeared. His sentiments were elevated, and inspired\r\nesteem: they had a softness that conciliated affection. His elocution\r\nwas handsome: his address easy, polite, and insinuating. By his merit,\r\nhe had acquired the unlimited confidence of his General, and was\r\nmaking a rapid progress in military rank and reputation. But in the\r\nheight of his career, flushed with new hopes from the execution of a\r\nproject, the most beneficial to his party that could be devised, he was\r\nat once precipitated from the summit of prosperity, and saw all the\r\nexpectations of his ambition blasted, and himself ruined.\r\n\r\nThe character I have given of him, is drawn partly from what I saw\r\nof him myself, and partly from information. I am aware that a man of\r\nreal merit is never seen in so favorable a light as through the medium\r\nof adversity: the clouds that surround him, are shades that set off\r\nhis good qualities. Misfortune cuts down the little vanities that, in\r\nprosperous times, serve as so many spots in his virtues; and gives a\r\ntone of humility that makes his worth more amiable. His spectators,\r\nwho enjoy a happier lot, are less prone to detract from it, through\r\nenvy, and are more disposed, by compassion, to give him the credit he\r\ndeserves, and perhaps even to magnify it.\r\n\r\nI speak not of André’s conduct in this affair as a philosopher, but as\r\na man of the world. The authorized maxims and practices of war, are\r\nthe satires of human nature. They countenance almost every species\r\nof seduction as well as violence; and the General who can make most\r\ntraitors in the army of his adversary, is frequently most applauded. On\r\nthis scale we acquit André; while we could not but condemn him, if we\r\nwere to examine his conduct by the sober rules of philosophy and moral\r\nrectitude. It is, however, a blemish on his fame, that he once intended\r\nto prostitute a flag: about this, a man of nice honor ought to have had\r\na scruple; but the temptation was great: let his misfortunes cast a\r\nveil over his error.\r\n\r\nSeveral letters from Sir Henry Clinton and others, were received in the\r\ncourse of the affair, feebly attempting to prove, that André came out\r\nunder the protection of a flag, with a passport from a general officer\r\nin actual service; and consequently could not be justly detained.\r\nClinton sent a deputation, composed of Lieutenant-General Robinson,\r\nMr. Elliot, and Mr. William Smith, to represent, as he said, the true\r\nstate of Major André’s case. General Greene met Robinson, and had a\r\nconversation with him; in which he reiterated the pretence of a flag;\r\nurged André’s release as a personal favor to Sir Henry Clinton; and\r\noffered any friend of ours, in their power, in exchange. Nothing could\r\nhave been more frivolous than the plea which was used. The fact was,\r\nthat beside the time, manner, object of the interview, change of dress,\r\nand other circumstances, there was not a single formality customary\r\nwith flags; and the passport was not to Major André, but to Mr.\r\nAnderson. But had there been, on the contrary, all the formalities, it\r\nwould be an abuse of language to say, that the sanction of a flag for\r\ncorrupting an officer to betray his trust, ought to be respected. So\r\nunjustifiable a purpose, would not only destroy its validity, but make\r\nit an aggravation.\r\n\r\nAndré, himself, has answered the argument, by ridiculing and exploding\r\nthe idea, in his examination before the Board of Officers. It was a\r\nweakness to urge it.\r\n\r\nThere was, in truth, no way of saving him. Arnold, or he, must have\r\nbeen the victim: the former was out of our power.\r\n\r\nIt was by some suspected, Arnold had taken his measures in such a\r\nmanner, that if the interview had been discovered in the act, it might\r\nhave been in his power to sacrifice André to his own security. This\r\nsurmise of double treachery, made them imagine Clinton might be induced\r\nto give up Arnold for André; and a gentleman took occasion to suggest\r\nthis expedient to the latter, as a thing that might be proposed by him.\r\nHe declined it. The moment he had been capable of so much frailty, I\r\nshould have ceased to esteem him.\r\n\r\nThe infamy of Arnold’s conduct previous to his desertion, is only\r\nequalled by his baseness since. Beside the folly of writing to Sir\r\nHenry Clinton, assuring him that André had acted under a passport from\r\nhim, and according to his directions while commanding officer at a\r\npost; and that, therefore, he did not doubt, he would be immediately\r\nsent in; he had the effrontery to write to General Washington in the\r\nsame spirit; with the addition of a menace of retaliation, if the\r\nsentence should be carried into execution. He has since acted the farce\r\nof sending in his resignation. This man is, in every sense, despicable.\r\nAdded to the scene of knavery and prostitution during his command in\r\nPhiladelphia, which the late seizure of his papers has unfolded; the\r\nhistory of his command at West Point is a history of little, as well\r\nas great, villanies. He practised every dirty art of peculation; and\r\neven stooped to connections with the suttlers of the garrison, to\r\ndefraud the public.\r\n\r\nTo his conduct, that of the captors of André forms a striking contrast.\r\nHe tempted them with the offer of his watch, his horse, and any sum\r\nof money they should name. They rejected his offers with indignation:\r\nand the gold that could seduce a man high in the esteem and confidence\r\nof his country, who had the remembrance of past exploits, the motives\r\nof present reputation and future glory, to prop his integrity, had\r\nno charms for three simple peasants, leaning only on their virtue\r\nand an honest sense of their duty. While Arnold is handed down, with\r\nexecration, to future times, posterity will repeat, with reverence, the\r\nnames of Van Wart, Paulding, and Williams.\r\n\r\nI congratulate you, my friend, on our happy escape from the mischiefs\r\nwith which this treason was big. It is a new comment on the value of an\r\nhonest man, and if it were possible, would endear you to me more than\r\never.\r\n\r\n                                                   Adieu,\r\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHUYLER TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  Poughkeepsie, Sept. 10, 1780.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir:\r\n\r\nI am very apprehensive the unhappy event, mentioned in your favor of\r\nthe fifth instant, will draw very serious consequences in its train. It\r\nwill certainly much embarrass us, and probably retard the termination\r\nof the war. It will, however, be attended with one good; the adherents,\r\nin Congress, to the gallant Commander, will not have it any longer in\r\ntheir power to play him off against the General. Gracious God! that\r\nany rational being should put two men in competition, one of which has\r\n_commanded_ an army, the other only been at the head of one; for I\r\naver, that when he was to the northward, he never made a disposition of\r\nhis troops. Indeed he was incapable: he never saw an enemy, except at\r\na good distance, and from places of perfect security. Indeed, indeed,\r\nhe has not lost a whit, in my estimation, by this stroke of his.\r\n\r\nThe General will have shown you extracts from the Senate and Assembly’s\r\nAddresses to the Governor. A Committee of both Houses is appointed to\r\nreport on the proceedings of the Convention: they will certainly adopt\r\nand extend the views of that Convention. Some here are for appointing\r\na Dictator, with a Vice Dictator in each State, invested with all the\r\npowers conferred formerly by the Roman people on theirs. I made great\r\ninterest to be left out of the delegation, and obtained it, although\r\nnot without much difficulty. General M’Dougal is appointed in my stead:\r\nbut I believe I shall be obliged to go to the eastern Convention. If\r\nso, I shall not repair to Rhode Island so soon as I intended.\r\n\r\nColonel Warner is wounded, and two of his officers killed near Fort\r\nEdward.\r\n\r\nPray make my respects acceptable to the General, to the gentlemen of\r\nthe family, the Marquis, and those of his.\r\n\r\n                                      Adieu.\r\n                                      I am, dear Sir,\r\n                                      Very affectionately and sincerely,\r\n                                      Your most obedient servant,\r\n                                      Ph. Schuyler.\r\n\r\nI forgot to inform the General that the Governor had sent him an\r\nextract of the proceedings of the Convention which I had promised to\r\ntransmit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHUYLER TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Poughkeepsie, September 16, 1780.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nThe great scarcity of wheat before harvest, and the drought since,\r\nhas prevented the agent appointed to collect the supply required from\r\nthis State, to deliver it to the Issuing Commissary; and we are at\r\nleast ten thousand barrels in arrears; the wheat for all which is\r\nalready assessed, a considerable quantity of it brought to the mills\r\nto be manufactured, and the remainder daily collecting. Hence, unless\r\na second drought should prevail, our deficiency can be made good in\r\nthe course of a month: and this may be relied on. But should the\r\narmy actually be in operation, I do not _make a doubt_ but that the\r\nhand of Government will be laid on all in the country; and, in that\r\ncase, a constant supply can be kept up so as to complete to thirty\r\nthousand barrels, and perhaps half as much more, should Congress\r\norder the quota of Pennsylvania (if she deigns to furnish any) to be\r\nsold, and the money transmitted to this State. Exclusive of the wheat\r\nalready assessed to complete our quota of flour, the inhabitants of\r\nTryon County, and the western part of Albany, are threshing. This the\r\nLegislature has ordered to be purchased for a State Magazine, should we\r\nnot be able to purchase the whole. The whole may, however, be obtained,\r\nand without delay, if an operation takes place: to procure flour casks\r\nis the greatest difficulty. I wish those at West Point were ordered\r\nto be immediately put in order: those, and an aid of bags, may be\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nI have communed with the Governor on the subject of M’Henry’s wish. He\r\nis very much disposed to use his influence on the occasion, but doubts\r\nif he should be able to obtain a Lieutenancy, unless the Ensigns that\r\nnow are, could all be provided for. If M’Henry merely wants military\r\nrank for the campaign, and will not accept of an Ensigncy, the Governor\r\ncan, and will, give him a Lieutenant-Colonelcy in the State Levies,\r\nwhich will always give him rank in our militia, and, consequently, in\r\nthe army, when the militia is in the field. But this must be determined\r\nbefore the Legislature rises. Please, therefore, to desire M’Henry to\r\nwrite me on the subject without delay, and to assure him of the best\r\nservices in my power.\r\n\r\nIf I knew when you would be at Fishkill, if you pass that way, I would\r\nmeet you there. Or if I believed it would not be disagreeable to the\r\nGeneral, I would go to Hartford, as I wish to see the other Sachem.\r\n\r\nA spirit favorable to the common cause, has pervaded almost both\r\nHouses. They begin to talk of a Dictator and Vice Dictators, as if\r\nit was a thing that was already determined on. To the Convention to\r\nbe held at Hartford, I believe I shall be sent, with instructions to\r\npropose that a Dictator should be appointed.\r\n\r\nI have just seen Van Schaick’s whim. There is not one Lieutenancy\r\nvacant.\r\n\r\nI have had the inclosed several days with me, for want of a conveyance.\r\nPlease to dispatch the bearer as expeditiously back as you can.\r\nCompliments to all.\r\n\r\n                             I am, dear Sir, affectionately yours, etc.,\r\n                             Ph. Schuyler.\r\n\r\nColonel Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO GREENE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   25th September, 1780.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nThere has just been unfolded at this place a scene of the blackest\r\ntreason. Arnold has fled to the enemy--André, the British Adjutant\r\nGeneral, is in our possession as a spy. His capture unravelled the\r\nmystery.\r\n\r\nWest Point was to have been the sacrifice. All the dispositions have\r\nbeen made for the purpose, and ’tis possible, though not probable, we\r\nmay still see the execution. The wind is fair. I came here in pursuit\r\nof Arnold, but was too late. I advise your putting the army under\r\nmarching orders, and detaching a brigade immediately this way.\r\n\r\n                                             I am, with great regard,\r\n                                             Your most obedient servant,\r\n                                             Alex. Hamilton,\r\n                                             Aid-de-Camp.\r\n\r\nTo Major General Greene.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO MISS SCHUYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     September 25, 1780.\r\n\r\nArnold, hearing of the plot being detected, immediately fled to the\r\nenemy. I went in pursuit of him, but was much too late; and could\r\nhardly regret the disappointment, when, on my return, I saw an amiable\r\nwoman, frantic with distress for the loss of a husband she tenderly\r\nloved; a traitor to his country and to his fame; a disgrace to his\r\nconnections: it was the most affecting scene I ever was witness to.\r\nShe, for a considerable time, entirely lost herself. The General went\r\nup to see her, and she upbraided him with being in a plot to murder her\r\nchild. One moment she raved, another she melted into tears. Sometimes\r\nshe pressed her infant to her bosom, and lamented its fate, occasioned\r\nby the imprudence of its father, in a manner that would have pierced\r\ninsensibility itself. All the sweetness of beauty, all the loveliness\r\nof innocence, all the tenderness of a wife, and all the fondness of a\r\nmother, showed themselves in her appearance and conduct. We have every\r\nreason to believe, that she was entirely unacquainted with the plan,\r\nand that the first knowledge of it, was when Arnold went to tell her\r\nhe must banish himself from his country and from her for ever. She\r\ninstantly fell into a convulsion, and he left her in that situation.\r\n\r\nThis morning she is more composed. I paid her a visit, and endeavored\r\nto soothe her by every method in my power; though you may imagine she\r\nis not easily to be consoled. Added to her other distresses, she is\r\nvery apprehensive the resentment of her country will fall upon her (who\r\nis only unfortunate) for the guilt of her husband.\r\n\r\nI have tried to persuade her that her fears are ill founded; but she\r\nwill not be convinced. She received us in bed, with every circumstance\r\nthat would interest our sympathy: and her sufferings were so eloquent,\r\nthat I wished myself her brother, to have a right to become her\r\ndefender. As it is, I have entreated her to enable me to give her\r\nproofs of my friendship. Could I forgive Arnold for sacrificing his\r\nhonor, reputation, and duty, I could not forgive him for acting a part\r\nthat must have forfeited the esteem of so fine a woman. At present she\r\nalmost forgets his crime in his misfortunes; and her horror at the\r\nguilt of the traitor, is lost in her love of the man. But a virtuous\r\nmind cannot long esteem a base one; and time will make her despise if\r\nit cannot make her hate.\r\n\r\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO MISS SCHUYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                          Tappan, Oct. 2, 1780.\r\n\r\nPoor André suffers to-day. Every thing that is amiable in virtue, in\r\nfortitude, in delicate sentiment, and accomplished manners, pleads for\r\nhim: but hard-hearted policy calls for a sacrifice. He must die----. I\r\nsend you my account of Arnold’s affair; and to justify myself to your\r\nsentiments, I must inform you, that I urged a compliance with André’s\r\nrequest to be shot; and I do not think it would have had an ill effect:\r\nbut some people are only sensible to motives of policy, and sometimes,\r\nfrom a narrow disposition, mistake it.\r\n\r\nWhen André’s tale comes to be told, and present resentment is over; the\r\nrefusing him the privilege of choosing the manner of his death will be\r\nbranded with too much obstinacy.\r\n\r\nIt was proposed to me to suggest to him the idea of an exchange for\r\nArnold; but I knew I should have forfeited his esteem by doing it,\r\nand therefore declined it. As a man of honor he could not but reject\r\nit; and I would not for the world have proposed to him a thing which\r\nmust have placed me in the unamiable light of supposing him capable of\r\nmeanness, or of not feeling myself the impropriety of the measure. I\r\nconfess to you, I had the weakness to value the esteem of a dying man,\r\nbecause I reverenced his merit.\r\n\r\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHUYLER TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      Albany, October 10, 1780.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir:\r\n\r\nI am still confined to my room, but believe my disorder has taken a\r\nfavorable turn, and that I shall soon be tolerably restored.\r\n\r\nColonel Van Schaick informs me that he is ordered down with his\r\nregiment. We are so sadly off here for directors, that I most sincerely\r\nwish he had been permitted to remain here: his deafness will render him\r\nlittle serviceable with his regiment.\r\n\r\nI am informed that some people have recommended, or intend to\r\nrecommend, to the General, to evacuate Fort Schuyler. I hope it will\r\nnot take place, as the enemy would immediately occupy the ground,\r\nand make it a receptacle for Indians and tories, from whence to pour\r\ndestruction on the country. A certain Lieutenant Laird, of the militia,\r\nwho was carried off, or went off voluntarily, with Sir John Johnson,\r\nwhen last in the country, is returned, and advises that about two\r\nthousand men were collected at St. John’s to make separate attacks on\r\nthe Grants, Saratoga, and the Mohawk river. If this be true, it was\r\nprobably intended as a co-operating plan, if Sir Harry had come up the\r\nriver. An Express is this moment arrived, announcing that about five\r\nhundred men of the enemy are arrived at the Canajoharie Falls. If this\r\nshould be confirmed, I shall venture to advise Van Schaick to detain\r\nhis regiment, and hope it will meet the General’s approbation. It is\r\nsaid the enemy are fortifying at Oswego. I hope the garrison for that\r\nplace will be speedily sent up.\r\n\r\nWhen do you intend to be here? Who will accompany you? Is it probable\r\nthe General will pay us a visit in winter? I most earnestly wish\r\nit. Will you make my excuses to the Marquis for my not writing him:\r\nthe Doctor will not permit me; but what is worse, I really have not\r\nstrength as yet. Entreat the General to accept of my best wishes: the\r\nfamily share in them. Adieu, my dear sir.\r\n\r\n                                                  I am, affectionately,\r\n                                                  Yours, etc., etc.,\r\n                                                  Ph. Schuyler.\r\n\r\nColonel Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO ISAAC SEARS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      Boston, October 12, 1780.\r\n\r\nI was much obliged to you, my dear sir, for the letter which you did me\r\nthe favor to write me since your return to Boston. I am sorry to find\r\nthat the same spirit of indifference to public affairs prevails. It is\r\nnecessary we should rouse, and begin to do our business in earnest, or\r\nwe shall play a losing game. It is impossible the contest can be much\r\nlonger supported on the present footing. We must have a Government with\r\nmore power. We must have a tax in kind. We must have a foreign loan.\r\nWe must have a Bank, on the true principles of a Bank. We must have\r\nan Administration distinct from Congress, and in the hands of single\r\nmen under their orders. We must, above all things, have an army for\r\nthe war, and an establishment that will interest the officers in the\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nCongress are deliberating on our military affairs: but I apprehend\r\ntheir resolutions will be tinctured with the old spirit. We seem to be\r\nproof against experience. They will, however, recommend an army for the\r\nwar, at least as a primary object. All those who love their country,\r\nought to exert their influence in the States where they reside, to\r\ndetermine them to take up this object with energy. The States must sink\r\nunder the burden of temporary enlistments; and the enemy will conquer\r\nus by degrees during the intervals of our weakness.\r\n\r\nClinton is now said to be making a considerable detachment to the\r\nsouthward. My fears are high, my hopes low. We are told here, there\r\nis to be a Congress of the neutral powers at the Hague, for mediating\r\nof peace. God send it may be true. We want it: but if the idea goes\r\nabroad, ten to one if we do not fancy the thing done, and fall into a\r\nprofound sleep till the cannon of the enemy awaken us next campaign.\r\nThis is our national character.\r\n\r\n                                      I am, with great regard, dear Sir,\r\n                                      Your most obedient servant,\r\n                                      A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO DUANE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          Oct. 18, 1780.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir:\r\n\r\nSince my last to you, I have had the pleasure of receiving two\r\nletters from you. I am sorry to find we do not seem to agree in the\r\nproper remedies to our disorder, at least in the practicability of\r\napplying those which are proper. Convinced, as I am, of the absolute\r\ninsufficiency of our present system to our safety, if I do not despair\r\nof the Republic, it is more the effect of constitution than of judgment.\r\n\r\nWith the sentiments I entertain of Gates, I cannot but take pleasure in\r\nhis removal; and with the confidence I have in Greene, I expect much\r\nfrom his being the successor; at least, I expect all his circumstances\r\nwill permit. You seem to have mistaken me on the subject of this\r\ngentleman. When I spoke of prejudice, I did not suppose it to exist\r\nwith you, but with Congress as a body; at least with a great part of\r\nthem. The part they have taken in the affair, in my opinion, does honor\r\nto their impartiality. I hope they will support the officer appointed\r\nwith a liberal confidence; his situation surrounded with difficulties\r\nwill need support. Of your influence for this purpose I am too\r\nthoroughly persuaded of your patriotism, my dear sir, to doubt.\r\n\r\nBe assured, my dear sir, the marks of your regard give me a sincere\r\npleasure, and I shall be always happy to cultivate it, and to give you\r\nproofs of my affectionate attachment.\r\n\r\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHUYLER TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     Saratoga, Oct. 19th, 1780.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nYour favor of the 12th inst., I had the pleasure to receive last night.\r\nMajor Carlton, as you will have heard, has been down to the vicinity\r\nof this place, at the head of eight hundred British, about two hundred\r\nenlisted tories, and as many Indians. Fort Ann and Fort George fell\r\ninto his hands; he burnt Kings and Queensborough townships, and the\r\nnorth part of this district, to within five miles of my house. The\r\nthree months’ men have evacuated Fort Edward, so that I have nobody\r\nbetween me and the enemy except two poor families, and about one\r\nhundred militia with me; on the 17th about one hundred and fifty of the\r\nenemy burnt Balstown, which lies about twenty miles below me and about\r\ntwelve miles west of the road leading to Albany; another party is about\r\neighteen miles east of me, where they have burnt about ten houses. The\r\nvery valuable settlement of Schoharie, which lays west of Albany, was\r\nalso entirely consumed on the 17th instant. Thus are we surrounded from\r\nevery quarter, and the inhabitants flying down the country. I believe\r\nmy turn will be in a few days, unless troops are sent up. Carlton is at\r\nTiconderoga and Mount Independence, and waits a reinforcement, which\r\nis momentarily expected; my informant says he intends a second tour to\r\ndestroy the settlements on this river, as far as to where the Mohawk\r\nRiver falls into it, which is about twenty-four miles below this. I\r\nmost sincerely wish that some continental troops were hastened up for\r\nthe protection of the county. I entreated Van Schaick to remain.\r\n\r\n                                                   P. Schuyler.\r\n\r\n  Col. Hamilton, from\r\n  Gen’l Schuyler.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHARRISON TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       October 27, 1780.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Hamilton:\r\n\r\nWe are only leaving Philadelphia. The most flattering attentions have\r\nbeen paid to Meade and myself, and such as would not permit us to\r\nprogress before, unless we had shown ourselves entirely disregardless\r\nof the great world. Besides, motives of a public nature concurred to\r\nmake us stay thus long. From all I have seen and heard, there is a good\r\ndisposition in Congress to do all they can for the army and the public\r\ninterest; and there are many very sensible men among them. In general,\r\nthey are most warmly attached to the General; and his recommendations\r\nwill have their weight while the same spirit prevails. It is said there\r\nhas been infinitely more harmony among them for some time past, than\r\nhas appeared since the first years of their appointment. I am not,\r\nhowever, without some apprehension, that if they proceed in the case\r\nof Lee, etc., the MONSTER (PARTY) may show itself again, and that we may\r\nhave a second edition of the measures adopted in the instance of Deane.\r\nOur friends Sullivan and Carroll have been of great service: and\r\ngentlemen who are, or pretend to be, in the secrets of the cabinet,\r\nsay they have contributed immeasurably, by their independent conduct,\r\nto destroy the EASTERN ALLIANCE. Bland is very clever, and without\r\nquestion wishes to push on in the true and right road. Grayson says\r\nthis is the best Congress we have had since the first. Our dear Laurens\r\nrespects many of the members: and General Greene’s appointment, I\r\nbelieve, is entirely consonant to the wishes of Congress in general,\r\nthough we have heard there were members much disposed, if facts had\r\nnot been so obstinate, to excuse General Gates. The former is here,\r\nand I suppose will set out in a day or two. Meade and I will serve\r\nhim all we can. We have done what we could already. Apropos, you\r\ndelivered him my letter. Our finances are entirely deranged, and there\r\nis little or no money in the treasury. I believe they are a subject\r\nof much consideration and puzzlement. The supplies of the army are\r\nalso matters of present attention, but I don’t know what will be\r\ndone. I hope we shall, by Christmas, have some clothing from the West\r\nIndies, if the moth have not destroyed it: a quantity, it is said, has\r\nbeen lying there. It is much to be wished that General Greene were\r\nat the South. The delegates from that quarter think the situation of\r\nCornwallis delicate, and that by management, and a proper application\r\nand use of the force there, the late check given Furguson might be\r\nimproved into the Earl’s total defeat. This, I fear, is too much even\r\nto hope. The sending the Baron is considered, as far as I have heard,\r\nperfectly right, and Lee’s corps give great satisfaction. I am just\r\nabout to mount my horse, and therefore shall say but little more.\r\nLaurens will write unto you in a few days, I suppose, and communicate\r\nany new occurrences. My love to the lads of the family. The same to\r\nyou. May you be long happy. My most respectful compliments to the\r\nGeneral.\r\n\r\n                                          Most truly and affectionately,\r\n                                          Rob. H. Harrison.\r\n\r\nP. S. The Board have been absolutely too poor to procure parchment for\r\nthe many promotions that have been required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                   1780.\r\n\r\nDear Hamilton:\r\n\r\nI shall be obliged to you for the answer to the address, as soon as it\r\nis convenient to you. If we do not ride to the Point to see the fleet\r\npass out, I am to have a conference with Count de Rochambeau, and the\r\nengineer, directly after breakfast, at which I wish you to be present.\r\n\r\n                                I am sincerely and affectionately yours,\r\n                                Geo. Washington.\r\n\r\nHalf-past, A. M.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLA FAYETTE TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     November 22d, 1780.\r\n\r\nInclosed, my dear Hamilton, I send you a letter for Mr. De Marbois,\r\nwherein are contained two exemplaires of my dispatches to Doctor\r\nFranklin. In the hurry of our arrangement, I forgot to mention them\r\nto the General. Be pleased to give him a summary of their contents,\r\nto which I have added the southern news of yesterday. Tell him that,\r\nknowing from experience, how negligent we were in sending accounts to\r\nEurope, I take upon myself to forward such as may influence mediating\r\npowers in case of a negotiation.\r\n\r\nI have made a calculation about boats, and think that if _we act upon\r\na large scale_ in the Staten Island expedition, we ought to have\r\nforty boats--about a thousand (the hundred artillery included) for\r\nthe watering place and Richmond; your attack should have two hundred.\r\nIn this calculation I put the staff and other officers, &c., twelve\r\nhundred men, or thirty per boat, makes forty boats; at least we ought\r\nnot to have much less.\r\n\r\nLet me know, my dear friend, if what we were speaking of last night,\r\nand the night before last, will be complied with. In consequence of\r\nwhat was said by the General, I was set at liberty to speak fully to\r\nG., who was charmed with the beauty and propriety of the thing. I am\r\nfully, fully of opinion that we would be very sorry not to go (at least\r\nconditionally), upon that plan, which perhaps will be as easy as any\r\nthing else: we may even say, il est beau même d’en tomber. Adieu; write\r\nme upon what scale, that I may prepare my troops. To-morrow we must\r\ncarry your private affair. Show me your letter before you give it.\r\n\r\n                                                    Yours,\r\n                                                    La Fayette.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                      November 22, 1780.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nSome time last fall, when I spoke to your Excellency about going to\r\nthe southward, I explained to you candidly my feelings with respect to\r\nmilitary reputation; and how much it was my object to act a conspicuous\r\npart in some enterprise, that might perhaps raise my character as a\r\nsoldier above mediocrity. You were so good as to say, you would be glad\r\nto furnish me with an occasion. When the expedition to Staten Island\r\nwas afoot, a favorable one seemed to offer. There was a battalion\r\nwithout a field officer, the command of which, I thought, as it\r\nwas accidental, might be given to me without inconvenience. I made\r\nan application for it through the Marquis, who informed me of your\r\nrefusal on two principles: one, that the giving me a whole battalion\r\nmight be a subject of dissatisfaction; the other, that if any accident\r\nshould happen to me in the present state of your family, you would be\r\nembarrassed for the necessary assistance.\r\n\r\nThe project you now have in contemplation affords another opportunity.\r\nI have a variety of reasons, that press me to desire ardently to have\r\nit in my power to improve it. I take the liberty to observe, that\r\nthe command may now be proportioned to my rank; and that the second\r\nobjection ceases to operate, as, during the period of establishing\r\nour winter quarters, there will be a suspension of material business:\r\nbesides which, my peculiar situation will, in any case, call me away\r\nfrom the army in a few days, and Mr. Harrison may be expected back\r\nearly next month. My command may consist of one hundred and fifty or\r\ntwo hundred men, composed of fifty men of Major Gibbes’ corps, fifty\r\nfrom Colonel Meigs’ regiment, and fifty or a hundred more from the\r\nlight infantry: Major Gibbes to be my Major. The hundred men from here\r\nmay move on Friday morning towards ----, which will strengthen the\r\nappearances for Staten Island, to form a junction on the other side of\r\nthe Passaic. I suggest this mode to avoid the complaints that might\r\narise from composing my party wholly of the Light Infantry, which might\r\ngive umbrage to the officers of that corps, who, on this plan, can have\r\nno just subject for it.\r\n\r\nThe primary idea may be, if circumstances permit, to attempt with my\r\ndetachment Bayard’s Hill. Should we arrive early enough to undertake\r\nit, I should prefer it to any thing else, both for the brilliancy\r\nof the attempt in itself, and the decisive consequence of which its\r\nsuccess would be productive. If we arrive too late to make this\r\neligible (as there is reason to apprehend), my corps may form the van\r\nof one of the other attacks, and Bayard’s Hill will be a pretext for\r\nmy being employed in the affair, on a supposition of my knowing the\r\nground, which is partly true. I flatter myself, also, that my military\r\ncharacter stands so well in the army, as to reconcile the officers, in\r\ngeneral, to the measure. All circumstances considered, I venture to\r\nsay, any exceptions which might be taken, would be unreasonable.\r\n\r\nI take this method of making the request, to avoid the embarrassment\r\nof a personal explanation. I shall only add, that however much I have\r\nthe matter at heart, I wish your Excellency entirely to consult your\r\nown inclination, and not, from a disposition to oblige me, to do any\r\nthing that may be disagreeable to you. It will, nevertheless, make me\r\nsingularly happy if your wishes correspond with mine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLA FAYETTE TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    Paramus, November 28, 1780.\r\n\r\nDear Hamilton:\r\n\r\nHere I arrived last night, and am going to set out for Philadelphia.\r\nGouvion goes straight to New Windsor, and by him I write to the\r\nGeneral. I speak of Hand and Smith, whom I recommend, and add: “If,\r\nhowever, you were to cast your eye on a man, who, I think, would suit\r\nbetter than any other in the world, Hamilton is, I confess, the officer\r\nwhom I would like best to see in my * * * * *.” Then I go on with the\r\nidea, that, at equal advantages, you deserve from him the preference;\r\nthat your advantages are the greatest; I speak of a co-operation;\r\nof your being in the family; and conclude, that on every public and\r\nprivate account I advise him to take you.\r\n\r\nI know the General’s friendship and gratitude for you, my dear\r\nHamilton: both are greater than you perhaps imagine. I am sure he needs\r\nonly to be told that something will suit you, and when he thinks he\r\ncan do it he certainly will. Before this campaign I was your friend,\r\nand very intimate friend, agreeably to the ideas of the world. Since\r\nmy second voyage, my sentiment has increased to such a point the world\r\nknows nothing about. To show _both_, from want and from scorn of\r\nexpressions, I shall only tell you--Adieu.\r\n\r\n                                                    Yours,\r\n                                                    La Fayette.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDE CORNY TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       Newport, 4th Dec., 1780.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nThe ill state of my health obliges me to request permission to\r\nreturn to France, for as short a time as possible. I must, before my\r\ndeparture, acquit myself of the double duty of thanking you for the\r\nfavors with which you have honored me, and of soliciting your orders\r\nfor my country. The satisfaction I feel of being chosen to accompany\r\nthe Marquis de la Fayette, and of executing under his orders, the\r\ndispositions necessary to the arrival of the French army, which, as\r\nan interesting period of my life, will not be superior to that of\r\nreturning to give our great and good General Washington new proofs of\r\nmy zeal. I shall always be honored in being reckoned one of your most\r\nfaithful comrades. I wish that happiness, success and glory follow you\r\nfor ever.\r\n\r\n                             I am, with everlasting attachment,\r\n                             Your most humble and most obedient servant,\r\n                             Estris de Corny,\r\n                             Lt. Colonel of Cavalry.\r\n\r\nI pray you to present my friendship and full compliments to the\r\nGeneral’s family.\r\n\r\nCol. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDU PORTAIL TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                   1780.\r\n\r\nJe vous prie, mon cher Colonel, de lire les papiers ci-joints, ils vous\r\nmettront au fait de ce dont il s’agit. Nous avons déjà parlé ensemble\r\nde cet objet, ainsi il est inutile d’y revenir, il est certain que\r\nsi Son Excellence ne vous favorit point dans ces occasions, il nous\r\nest absolument impossible pour nous mêmes de nous tirer d’embarras.\r\nL’homme dont il est question, et qui est celui qui vous remettra cette\r\nlettre, sert lui-même à prouver le peu de ressources que nous avons\r\ndans ce genre. M. de Vellefranche en avait été si mécontent la campagne\r\ndernière, qu’il l’avait renvoyé, et n’en voulait plus entendre parler.\r\nL’impossibilité d’en trouver un autre le force de le reprendre; il\r\nne demande pas mieux assurément que de le changer, il fait tous ses\r\nefforts pour cela, il frappe à toutes les portes, mais inutilement.\r\n\r\nIl est bien aisé de faire de belles loix pour corriger les abus; tout\r\nle monde voit les abus, tout le monde peut se faire valoir en déclamant\r\nd’autre, mais déterminer, presque les circonstances permettent, de\r\ncorriger l’abus, en supprimant des moyens abusifs de faire une chose en\r\nsubstituer d’autres voilà ce que les Réformateurs Croyans ne font pas\r\ntoujours.\r\n\r\nVous expliquerez cela à qui il appartient, probablement vous ne vous\r\ntromperez pas, au fait dont je vous prie de donner à M. de Villefranche\r\nun mot comme vous l’avez donné à M. de Rochefontaine.\r\n\r\nJe suis, mon cher Colonel, dans une totale défaute de livres anglais;\r\nj’en ai réluqué un sur la table aujourd’hui, que le Colonel Harrison\r\nm’a dit que vous lisiez, mais je pense que vous ne lisez pas les deux\r\nvolumes à la fois. Si vous pouviez m’en prêter un, vous obligeriez\r\nbeaucoup votre très humble serviteur.\r\n\r\n                                                    Du Portail.\r\n\r\nJe vous prie de me renvoyer les papiers en cachets.\r\n\r\n                                                    Du Portail.\r\n\r\nCol. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLA FAYETTE TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    Philadelphia, Dec. 9, 1780.\r\n\r\nDear Hamilton:\r\n\r\nOn my arrival at Paramus, I wrote a letter to the General, which\r\nColonel Gouvion was to deliver to himself at New Windsor; so that more\r\nexpedition had been made than you had thought. But the General having\r\nunfortunately altered his mind, and taken the road to Morristown,\r\nanother misfortune threw Hand in his way; and remembering your advice\r\non the occasion, he hastened to make him the proposition, and in\r\nconsequence of it wrote his letter to Congress. From Paramus I went\r\nmyself to the Lots, and from thence to Morristown, where I met the\r\nGeneral; and knowing that my letter could not reach him under some\r\ndays, I became regardless of your wishes, and made a verbal application\r\nin my own name, and about the same time that had been settled between\r\nus. I can’t express to you, my dear friend, how sorry and disappointed\r\nI felt, when I knew from him, the General, that (greatly in consequence\r\nof your advice) he had settled the whole matter with Hand, and written\r\nfor him to Congress. I confess I became warmer on the occasion than\r\nyou would perhaps have wished me to be; and I wanted the General to\r\nallow my sending an express, who would have overtaken the letter, as it\r\nwas in the hands of General St. Clair: but the General did not think it\r\nto be a convenient measure; and, I confess, I may have been a little\r\nblinded on its propriety. I took care not to compromise you in this\r\naffair, when the General expressed a desire to serve you, and in a\r\nmanner you would have been satisfied with. Now for the voyage to France.\r\n\r\nCongress seem resolved that an _Envoy be sent in the way you wish_, and\r\nthis was yesterday determined in the House. Next Monday the gentleman\r\nwill be elected. I have already spoken to many members. I know of a\r\nnumber of voices that will be for you. This day, and that of to-morrow,\r\nwill be by me employed in paying visits. As soon as the business is\r\nfixed upon, I shall send you an express. I think you ought to hold\r\nyourself in readiness, and in case you are called for, come with all\r\npossible speed; for you must go immediately, that you may have returned\r\nbefore the beginning of operations. If you go, my dear sir, I shall\r\ngive you all public or private knowledge about Europe I am possessed\r\nof. Besides many private letters, that may introduce you to my friends,\r\nI intend giving you the _key_ of the cabinet, as well as of the\r\nsocieties which influence them. In a word, my good friend, any thing in\r\nmy power shall be entirely yours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                          Albany, Dec. 9, 1780.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nMr. Rensselaer, who has the direction of the Armory here, tells me that\r\nthe Board of War write him, they are unable to support it any longer\r\non the present establishment for want of supplies, and propose to him\r\nto endeavor to have it carried on by contract. This he declares is\r\nimpossible. The Armory must either continue on the present footing\r\nor cease. As far as I understand the matter, there is no objection\r\nto the terms in themselves, but a want of means to comply with them.\r\nIf there is a want of means, the thing must be relinquished; but as\r\nit does not strike me that it can be more difficult to maintain an\r\nArmory here than elsewhere; and as I apprehend, in the present state\r\nof Arsenals, we shall stand in need of all the repairing we can do; I\r\ntake the liberty, at Mr. Rensselaer’s request, to mention the matter\r\nto you. I have seen the Armory myself. It appears to be in excellent\r\norder, and under a very ingenious and industrious man. I am told it\r\nhas been conducted hitherto with great activity. Its situation is, in\r\nmy opinion, advantageous. As there is a considerable body of troops\r\nalways at West Point, and the army generally in its vicinity, the river\r\nis very convenient for transportation to and from the Armory; and, I\r\nshould think, would be conducive to economy. This consideration strikes\r\nme as of importance. General Knox, however, will be the best judge of\r\nthe usefulness of this Armory.\r\n\r\nMr. Rensselaer also mentions a considerable number of hides in the\r\nhands of persons here who had had orders from the Clothier-General not\r\nto dispose of them but by his order. He says he can no longer, but with\r\ngreat difficulty, procure leather for the public works on credit; and\r\nhas requested me to mention this also to your Excellency.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hamilton presents her respectful compliments to Mrs. Washington\r\nand yourself. After the holidays we shall be at head quarters.\r\n\r\nI believe I imparted to you General Schuyler’s wish that you could make\r\nit convenient to pay a visit with Mrs. Washington this winter. He and\r\nMrs. Schuyler have several times repeated their inquiries and wishes. I\r\nhave told them I was afraid your business would not permit you: if it\r\nshould I shall be happy. You will enable me to let them know about what\r\nperiod it will suit. When the sleighing arrives, it will be an affair\r\nof two days up and two days down.\r\n\r\n                                                   I have, etc.,\r\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    New-Windsor, Dec. 27, 1780.\r\n\r\nDear Hamilton:\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 19th came safe by the Doctor, who set out this\r\nmorning for Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nI had, previous to the receipt of it, and without knowledge that the\r\nBoard of War had given any direction respecting the Armory at Albany,\r\nrequested the Governor to exempt (if he could do so with propriety) the\r\ncitizens who were employed in it, from military services in case of\r\nalarm; and had written to General Clinton to direct the Quarter-Master\r\nto afford every assistance in his power to have the work repaired, and\r\nthe business, as far as depended upon him, accelerated. I have now\r\ngiven order for delivery of such hides as Mr. Rensselaer shall find\r\n_absolutely_ necessary for the use of the Armory.\r\n\r\nAlthough a trip to Albany, on more accounts than one, would be\r\nperfectly agreeable to my wishes, I am so far from having it in my\r\npower, at this time, to fix a period for this gratification of them,\r\nthat I have but small hope of accomplishing it at all this winter.\r\nThere are some matters in suspense which may make a journey to Rhode\r\nIsland necessary; but as the subject is not fit for a letter, I shall\r\nwithhold the communication till I see you.\r\n\r\nA second embarkation has taken place at New-York. The strength of the\r\ndetachment, or its destination, are vaguely reported; and no certainty\r\nunder whose command it goes. Arnold is said to be of it; from whence\r\nthe connections conclude that New-Haven or New-London must infallibly\r\nbe the object, while more rational conjecturers send it to the\r\nsouthward, from whence no late accounts have been received.\r\n\r\nMrs. Washington most cordially joins me in compliments of\r\ncongratulation to Mrs. Hamilton and yourself, on the late happy event\r\nof your marriage, and in wishes to see you both at head quarters. We\r\nbeg of you to present our respectful compliments to General Schuyler,\r\nhis lady and family, and offer them strong assurances of the pleasure\r\nwe should feel at seeing them at New-Windsor.\r\n\r\n                             With much truth, and great personal regard,\r\n                             I am, dear Hamilton,\r\n                             Your affectionate friend and servant,\r\n                             G. Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREENE TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       January 10, 1781.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Colonel:\r\n\r\nGeneral Du Portail being on his way to the northward, gives me an\r\nopportunity to write you, which I should have done before, had not my\r\nletters to His Excellency contained as full information of the state of\r\nthings as I was able to give, from the little time I had been in the\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\nWhen I was appointed to this command, I expected to meet with many\r\nnew and singular difficulties; but they infinitely exceed what I\r\napprehended. This is really carrying on a war in an enemy’s country;\r\nfor you cannot establish the most inconsiderable magazine, or convey\r\nthe smallest quantity of stores from one post to another, without\r\nbeing obliged to detach guards for their security. The division among\r\nthe people is much greater than I imagined; and the whigs and tories\r\npersecute each other with little less than savage fury. There is\r\nnothing but murders and devastations in every quarter.\r\n\r\nThe loss of our army at Charleston, and the defeat of General Gates,\r\nhas been the cause of keeping such shoals of militia on foot; and their\r\nservice has been accompanied with such destruction and loss, as has\r\nalmost laid waste the whole country. Nothing has been more destructive\r\nto the true interest of this country than the mode adopted for its\r\ndefence. Two misfortunes happening one after the other, may have\r\nrendered it unavoidable the last season; but should it be continued,\r\nthe inhabitants are inevitably ruined, and the resources of the country\r\nrendered incapable of affording support to an army competent to\r\nits defence. Government here is infinitely more popular than to the\r\nnorthward; and there is no such thing as national character or national\r\nsentiment. The inhabitants are from all quarters of the globe, and as\r\nvarious in their opinions, projects, and schemes, as their manners and\r\nhabits are from their early education. Those in office, from a vanity\r\nto be thought powerful, join in the measure of imposing upon the public\r\nrespecting the strength and resources of these southern States: and\r\nwhile Congress, and the minister of France, are kept under this fatal\r\ndelusion, I fear little support will be given to this department. The\r\ninhabitants are numerous; but they would be rather formidable abroad\r\nthan at home. They are scattered over such a vast extent of country,\r\nthat it is difficult to collect, and still more difficult to subsist\r\nthem. There is a great spirit of enterprise among the black people; and\r\nthose that come out as volunteers are not a little formidable to the\r\nenemy. There are, also, some particular corps under Sumpter, Marion,\r\nand Clarke, that are bold and daring; the rest of the militia are\r\nbetter calculated to destroy provisions than oppose the enemy.\r\n\r\nAt Philadelphia, and all my journey through the country, I endeavored\r\nto impress upon those in power, the necessity of sending clothing, and\r\nsupplies of every kind, immediately to this army. But poverty was urged\r\nas a plea, in bar to every application. They all promised fair, but I\r\nfear will do but little: ability is wanting with some, and inclination\r\nwith others.\r\n\r\nPublic credit is so totally lost, that private people will not give\r\ntheir aid, though they see themselves involved in one common ruin.\r\nIt is my opinion that General Washington’s influence will do more\r\nthan all the assemblies upon the continent. I always thought him\r\nexceeding popular; but in many places he is little less than adored,\r\nand universally admired. His influence in this country might possibly\r\neffect something great. However, I found myself exceedingly well\r\nreceived, but more from being the friend of the General, than from my\r\nown merit.\r\n\r\nThis country wants, for its defence, a small but well appointed army,\r\norganized so as to move with great celerity. It should consist of\r\nabout five thousand infantry, and from eight hundred to a thousand\r\nhorse. The enemy cannot maintain a larger force in this quarter,\r\nneither can we. The resources from the country are too small to subsist\r\na large body of troops at any one point: and to draw supplies from a\r\ndistance, through such long tracts of barren land, will be next to\r\nimpossible, unless the business can be aided by a water transportation;\r\nand, in either case, it will be accompanied with an amazing expense.\r\nCould we get a superiority of horse, we could soon render it difficult\r\nfor Lord Cornwallis to hold his position so far in the country. Nor\r\nshould I be under any apprehensions, with a much inferior force to\r\nhis, of taking post near him, if I had but such a body of horse. But\r\nthe enemy’s horse is so much superior to ours, that we cannot move a\r\ndetachment towards them without hazarding its ruin.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to the army, I found it in a most wretched condition. The\r\nofficers had lost all confidence in the General, and the troops all\r\ntheir discipline. The troops had not only lost their discipline, but\r\nthey were so addicted to plundering that they were a terror to the\r\ncountry. The General and I met at least upon very civil terms; and he\r\nexpressed the greatest happiness at my being appointed to succeed him.\r\n\r\nGeneral Smallwood and he were not upon good terms; the former suspected\r\nthe latter of having an intention to supplant him, but many think\r\nwithout reason. Others, again, are of opinion, his suspicions were well\r\nfounded, and that Smallwood was not a little mortified at my being\r\nappointed to this department, and got outrageous when he heard Baron\r\nSteuben was coming also. How the matter was, I know not; certain it\r\nis, he is gone home, having refused to act under Baron Steuben, and\r\ndeclares he will not serve at all, unless Congress will give him a\r\ncommission, dated at least two years before his appointment. This, I\r\nthink, can never happen, notwithstanding his private merit, and the\r\nclaim of the State. The battle of Camden here is represented widely\r\ndifferent from what it is to the northward.\r\n\r\nColonel Williams thinks that none of the general officers were entitled\r\nto any extraordinary merit. The action was short, and succeeded by a\r\nflight, wherein every body took care of himself, as well officers\r\nas soldiers. Not an officer, except Major Anderson, and one or two\r\nCaptains, that brought off the field of battle a single soldier. The\r\nColonel also says, that General Gates would have shared little more\r\ndisgrace than is the common lot of the unfortunate, notwithstanding he\r\nwas early off, if he had only halted at the Waxhaws or Charlotte--the\r\nfirst about sixty, and the last about eighty miles from the field of\r\nbattle. What little incidents either give or destroy reputation! How\r\nmany long hours a man may labor with an honest zeal in his country’s\r\nservice, and be disgraced for the most trifling error either in conduct\r\nor opinion! Hume very justly observes, no man will have reputation\r\nunless he is useful to society, be his merit or abilities what they\r\nmay. Therefore, it is necessary for a man to be fortunate, as well as\r\nwise and just. The greater part of the loss of the Maryland line, in\r\nthe action of Camden, happened after they began to retreat: indeed,\r\nthis was the case with all the troops. What gave Smallwood such great\r\nreputation, was his halt at Salisbury, which was nothing but accident.\r\nYou know there are great parties prevailing in the Maryland line; and\r\nperhaps his merit is not a little diminished on that account. I think\r\nhim a brave and good officer, but too slow to effect any thing great\r\nin a department like this, where embarrassments are without number,\r\nand where nothing can be effected without the greatest promptitude and\r\ndecision. This army is in such a wretched condition that I hardly know\r\nwhat to do with it. The officers have got such a habit of negligence,\r\nand the soldiers so loose and disorderly, that it is next to impossible\r\nto give it a military complexion. Without clothing, I am sure I shall\r\nnever do it. I call no councils of war, and I communicate my intentions\r\nto very few. The army was posted at Charlotte when I came up with\r\nit; and in a council it had been determined to winter there; but the\r\ndifficulty of procuring subsistence, and other reasons, induced me not\r\nonly to take a new position, but to make an entire new disposition.\r\nAll this I effected by a single order, having first made the necessary\r\ninquiry respecting the new positions, by sending a man to examine\r\nthe grounds and other requisites. If I cannot inspire the army with\r\nconfidence and respect by an independent conduct, I foresee it will\r\nbe impossible to instil discipline and order among the troops. General\r\nLeslie has arrived, and joined Lord Cornwallis, whose force now is more\r\nthan three times larger than ours. And we are subsisting ourselves by\r\nour own industry; and I am not without hopes of forming something like\r\na magazine. I am laboring also to get clothing from every quarter.\r\nBaron Steuben is in Virginia, and is indefatigable in equipping and\r\nforwarding the troops from that State. I left General Guest in Maryland\r\nfor the same purpose; but I have got nothing from there yet, nor do\r\nI expect much for months to come. The North Carolina State have such\r\na high opinion of the militia, that I don’t expect they will ever\r\nattempt to raise a single continental soldier; notwithstanding the most\r\nsensible among them will acknowledge the folly of employing militia.\r\n\r\nBut I must have tried your patience, and therefore will make a full\r\nstop concerning matters in this department, and inquire how you go on\r\nto the northward.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI beg my compliments to General Washington’s family, to General Knox\r\nand his family, and all other of my acquaintances.\r\n\r\nI shall be exceedingly obliged to you if you will communicate to me,\r\nwith great freedom, every thing worthy of note that is said or respects\r\nthis department.\r\n\r\n                                                   Yours affectionately,\r\n                                                   N. Greene.\r\n\r\nTo Col. Alexander Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEADE TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       January 13, 1781.\r\n\r\nWhat shall I say, or think, of my dear friend Hamilton? Not a single\r\nline from him since we parted. I will not, however, charge you, my dear\r\nfellow, with not having done your duty, or, at least, of a want of\r\ninclination to do it: you may have complied fully with your promise,\r\nand your letters miscarried: mine probably have shared the same fate.\r\nThis is the third since I got home. The first was writ shortly after\r\nGeneral Greene’s arrival at Richmond, and committed to his care; the\r\nsecond, telling you I was married, had not so favorable a prospect of\r\nconveyance; and this must take its chance.\r\n\r\nArnold, you knew, was coming here. He has really been here, and, with\r\nshame be it said, marched twenty-five miles, and back, without having\r\na single musket fired at him: but let me observe, in justice to the\r\npeople at large, that there are fewer disaffected by far, in this\r\nState, than any other in the Union; and that the people turn out with\r\nthe utmost cheerfulness. The misfortune, on the present invasion, was,\r\nthat in the confusion the arms were sent every where, and no timely\r\nplan laid to put them into the hands of the men who were assembling.\r\nThe Baron has, no doubt, given the General the particulars of the\r\nwhole affair. Should he not have done it, I must refer you for them to\r\nRivington’s paper: he can hardly be himself, and say any thing on the\r\nsubject that ought not to be credited. The damage, however, done by the\r\nenemy is not considerable, and much less than might have been expected\r\nfrom them. My friends have suffered. I have often felt much pain, my\r\ndear Hamilton, at scenes of the kind to the northward, but never in\r\nso great a degree as on this occasion. The nearest and dearest to me\r\nwere within reach of the enemy; wife, mother, brother, sister; and all\r\nhave shared deeply in the distress; and, indeed, many of them were in\r\npersonal danger, and my best friend of the number; myself of course\r\nsomewhat exposed. You possess a heart that can feel for me; you have a\r\nfemale, too, that you love. * * * * * After placing her, with at least\r\ntwenty other females and children, at a safe distance, I immediately\r\nreturned, and joined the Baron about the time the enemy left Richmond,\r\nin order to render him all the aid I could, being intimately acquainted\r\nwith the country for many miles in the vicinity of the enemy: and\r\non their return down the river, I left him to go in pursuit of a\r\nresidence for a favorite brother who was driven from his home, and\r\nobliged to attend to his wife and a family of little children.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis gives me an opening to speak of my return to the army. I have been\r\nlong wishing your advice in full on the occasion. You are acquainted\r\nwith the arguments I have used in favor of my stay here. * * * * * I\r\nhave not, however, as yet, thrown off the uniform, but I am inclined to\r\nbelieve it must be the case. If we meet not again, my dear Hamilton, as\r\nbrother aids, I still flatter myself that, in the course of time, we\r\nshall meet as the sincerest of friends. If you have not already writ to\r\nme, my dear fellow, let me entreat you, when you go about it, to fill\r\na sheet in close hand. Say all about yourself first, and next, what\r\nmay be most interesting and new to me, for I have not heard a syllable\r\nfrom camp since I left it. I wrote to the “Old Secretary” while he was\r\nin Virginia, but could not hear from him. Tell him that I suffered\r\nnot a little on his account, for I conceived, for a long time, that\r\nhis cousin’s unlucky fall from his horse had happened to him: such an\r\nopinion had like to have carried me to Alexandria.\r\n\r\nI am under the necessity of concluding, but first let me present my\r\nrespects to the General and Mrs. Washington, my sincerest esteem to\r\nthe lads of the family, and every officer of the army whom you know I\r\nregard.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                                   Your sincere friend,\r\n                                                   R. R. Meade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHUYLER TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      Albany, January 25, 1781.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nYesterday I received your favor of the sixteenth instant. It affords\r\nme pleasure to learn that the Pennsylvania line is reduced to order;\r\nbut we in this quarter are on the point of experiencing a similar\r\ncommotion. Two regiments threaten to march to head quarters, unless\r\nsome money is paid them, the certificates for the depreciation\r\nexpedited, and, in future, better supplied with provisions. Yesterday,\r\nabout three thousand bushels of wheat, six hundred pounds worth of beef\r\nand three or four thousand dollars, were subscribed. I am in hopes\r\nwe shall procure what will afford each man about ten dollars; and I\r\nhave some hopes that this, with a little management, will render them\r\ntolerably quiet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEntreat the General and his lady to accept my best wishes. Do not\r\nforget to remember me to Colonels Harrison and Tilghman. Adieu.\r\n\r\n                                                  I am, dear Sir,\r\n                                                  Most affectionately,\r\n                                                  Yours, etc., etc.,\r\n                                                  Ph: Schuyler.\r\n\r\nColonel Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHUYLER TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      Albany, February 5, 1781.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nThe plan you mention for supplying the armies in America, I should\r\nbe exceedingly happy to see attempted; but I fear Congress will not\r\nventure on it, although they should be convinced of its eligibility.\r\nIn the course of last year, I proposed it repeatedly to individual\r\nmembers, who generally approved, and once or twice took occasion to\r\nmention it in Congress; but in the House no one dared to give his\r\nopinion. I am persuaded, if it was adopted, that a saving, at present\r\nalmost inconceivable, would be induced, and an order and economy in the\r\npublic expenditures, which, whilst it would reconcile the minds of men\r\nto bear the public burthens with alacrity, would effectually eradicate\r\nthe fears which too generally prevail, that we shall sink under the\r\nenormous weight of our expenses. * * *\r\n\r\n                                                  I am, my dear Sir,\r\n                                                  Very affectionately,\r\n                                                  Yours, etc., etc.,\r\n                                                  Ph: Schuyler.\r\n\r\nColonel Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO SCHUYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Head Quarters, New Windsor, February 18, 1781.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir:\r\n\r\nSince I had the pleasure of writing you last, an unexpected change\r\nhas taken place in my situation. I am no longer a member of the\r\nGeneral’s family. This information will surprise you, and the manner\r\nof the change will surprise you more. Two days ago, the General and\r\nI passed each other on the stairs. He told me he wanted to speak to\r\nme. I answered that I would wait upon him immediately. I went below,\r\nand delivered Mr. Tilghman a letter to be sent to the commissary,\r\ncontaining an order of a pressing and interesting nature.\r\n\r\nReturning to the General, I was stopped on the way by the Marquis de\r\nLa Fayette, and we conversed together about a minute on a matter of\r\nbusiness. He can testify how impatient I was to get back, and that\r\nI left him in a manner which, but for our intimacy, would have been\r\nmore than abrupt. Instead of finding the General, as is usual, in his\r\nroom, I met him at the head of the stairs, where, accosting me in an\r\nangry tone, “Colonel Hamilton,” said he, “you have kept me waiting\r\nat the head of the stairs these ten minutes. I must tell you, sir,\r\nyou treat me with disrespect.” I replied, without petulancy, but with\r\ndecision, “I am not conscious of it, sir; but since you have thought\r\nit necessary to tell me so, we part.” “Very well, sir,” said he, “if\r\nit be your choice,” or something to this effect, and we separated.\r\nI sincerely believe my absence, which gave so much umbrage, did\r\nnot last two minutes. In less than an hour after, Tilghman came to\r\nme in the General’s name, assuring me of his great confidence in my\r\nabilities, integrity, usefulness, etc.; and of his desire, in a candid\r\nconversation, to heal a difference which could not have happened but in\r\na moment of passion. I requested Mr. Tilghman to tell him--1st. That I\r\nhad taken my resolution in a manner not to be revoked. 2d. That, as a\r\nconversation could serve no other purpose than to produce explanations,\r\nmutually disagreeable, though I certainly would not refuse an interview\r\nif he desired it, yet I would be happy if he would permit me to decline\r\nit. 3d. That though determined to leave the family, the same principles\r\nwhich had kept me so long in it, would continue to direct my conduct\r\ntowards him when out of it. 4th. That, however, I did not wish to\r\ndistress him, or the public business, by quitting him before he could\r\nderive other assistance by the return of some of the gentlemen who were\r\nabsent. 5th. And that, in the mean time, it depended on him, to let\r\nour behavior to each other be the same as if nothing had happened. He\r\nconsented to decline the conversation, and thanked me for my offer of\r\ncontinuing my aid in the manner I had mentioned.\r\n\r\nI have given you so particular a detail of our difference, from the\r\ndesire I have to justify myself in your opinion. Perhaps you may think\r\nI was precipitate in rejecting the overture made by the General to an\r\naccommodation. I must assure you, my dear sir, it was not the effect of\r\nresentment: it was the deliberate result of maxims I had long formed\r\nfor the government of my own conduct.\r\n\r\nI always disliked the office of an aid-de-camp, as having in it a\r\nkind of personal dependence. I refused to serve in this capacity with\r\ntwo Major-Generals, at an early period of the war. Infected, however,\r\nwith the enthusiasm of the times, an idea of the General’s character\r\novercame my scruples, and induced me to accept his invitation to enter\r\ninto his family * * *. It has been often with great difficulty that I\r\nhave prevailed upon myself not to renounce it; but while, from motives\r\nof public utility, I was doing violence to my feelings, I was always\r\ndetermined, if there should ever happen a breach between us, never to\r\nconsent to an accommodation. I was persuaded, that when once that nice\r\nbarrier, which marked the boundaries of what we owed to each other,\r\nshould be thrown down, it might be propped again, but could never be\r\nrestored.\r\n\r\nThe General is a very honest man. His competitors have slender\r\nabilities, and less integrity. His popularity has often been essential\r\nto the safety of America, and is still of great importance to it. These\r\nconsiderations have influenced my past conduct respecting him, and will\r\ninfluence my future. I think it is necessary he should be supported.\r\n\r\nHis estimation in your mind, whatever may be its amount, I am persuaded\r\nhas been formed on principles, which a circumstance like this cannot\r\nmaterially effect: but if I thought it could diminish your friendship\r\nfor him, I should almost forego the motives that urge me to justify\r\nmyself to you. I wish what I have said, to make no other impression\r\nthan to satisfy you I have not been in the wrong. It is also said in\r\nconfidence, as a public knowledge of the breach would, in many ways,\r\nhave an ill effect. It will probably be the policy of both sides to\r\nconceal it, and cover the separation with some plausible pretext. I am\r\nimportuned by such of my friends as are privy to the affair, to listen\r\nto a reconciliation; but my resolution is unalterable.\r\n\r\nAs I cannot think of quitting the army during the war, I have a project\r\nof re-entering into the artillery, by taking Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nForrest’s place, who is desirous of retiring on half-pay. I have not,\r\nhowever, made up my mind upon this head, as I should be obliged to come\r\nin the youngest Lieutenant-Colonel instead of the eldest, which I ought\r\nto have been by natural succession, had I remained in the corps; and,\r\nat the same time, to resume studies relative to the profession, which,\r\nto avoid inferiority, must be laborious.\r\n\r\nIf a handsome command in the campaign in the light infantry should\r\noffer itself, I shall balance between this and the artillery. My\r\nsituation in the latter would be more solid and permanent; but as I\r\nhope the war will not last long enough to make it progressive, this\r\nconsideration has the less force. A command for the campaign, would\r\nleave me the winter to prosecute studies relative to my future career\r\nin life * * *. I have written to you on this subject with all the\r\nfreedom and confidence to which you have a right, and with an assurance\r\nof the interest you take in all that concerns me.\r\n\r\n                                      Very sincerely and affectionately,\r\n                                      I am, dear Sir,\r\n                                      Your most obedient servant,\r\n                                      A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nGeneral Schuyler.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAURENS TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                   1781.\r\n\r\nI am indebted to you, my dear Hamilton, for two letters; the first\r\nfrom Albany, as masterly a piece of cynicism as ever was penned; the\r\nother from Philadelphia, dated the second March: in both, you mention\r\na design of retiring, which makes me exceedingly unhappy. I would not\r\nwish to have you, for a moment, withdrawn from the public service: at\r\nthe same time, my friendship for you, and knowledge of your value to\r\nthe United States, make me most ardently desire, that you should fill\r\nonly the first offices of the Republic. I was flattered with an account\r\nof your being elected a delegate from New-York, and am much mortified\r\nnot to hear it confirmed by yourself. I must confess to you, that, at\r\nthe present stage of the war, I should prefer your going into Congress,\r\nand from thence becoming a minister plenipotentiary for peace, to your\r\nremaining in the army, where the dull system of seniority, and the\r\n_tableau_, would prevent you from having the important commands to\r\nwhich you are entitled: but at any rate I will not have you renounce\r\nyour rank in the army, unless you entered the career above mentioned.\r\nYour private affairs cannot require such immediate and close attention.\r\nYou speak like a _paterfamilias_ surrounded with a numerous progeny.\r\n\r\nI had, in fact, resumed the black project, as you were informed,\r\nand urged the matter very strenuously, both to our privy council\r\nand legislative body; but I was out-voted, having only reason on my\r\nside, and being opposed by a triple-headed monster, that shed the\r\nbaneful influence of avarice, prejudice, and pusillanimity, in all\r\nour assemblies. It was some consolation to me, however, to find that\r\nphilosophy and truth had made some little progress since my last\r\neffort, as I obtained twice as many suffrages as before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDUKE DE LAUZUN TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n                                A Lebanon, le 26 Février, 1781.\r\n\r\nPermettez moi, Monsieur, de vous adresser une lettre pour le Marquis\r\nde Lafayette, ne sachant où il est. Je ne veux point importuner son\r\nExcellence dans un moment où tant d’affaires l’accablent. M. de Closen,\r\nAide-de-Camp de M. le Comte de Rochambeau, lui porte des dépêches\r\nimportantes; M. le Marquis de Laval paraît destiné à commander un\r\ndétachement de Grenadiers, et chasseurs de l’Armée Française. Je vous\r\nsupplie de vouloir bien rappeler au Général, que de quelque maniere\r\nqu’il me juge utile, je me trouverai heureux d’être employé, et qu’il\r\nveuille bien témoigner à M. de Rochambeau que ce choix ne lui sera pas\r\ndésagréable.\r\n\r\nRecevez les excuses de mon Importunité, et les assurances de tous les\r\nsentiments d’estime et de considération, avec lesquels j’ai l’honneur\r\nd’être, Monsieur, votre très humble et très obéissant serviteur.\r\n\r\n                                                     De Lauzun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHARRISON TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   New Windsor, March 26, 1781.\r\n\r\nI came here, my dear Hamilton, on Friday night, to bid adieu to the\r\nGeneral, to you, and to my other friends, as a military man, and regret\r\nmuch that I have not had the happiness of seeing you. To-morrow I am\r\nobliged to depart; and it is possible our separation may be for ever.\r\nBut be this as it may, it can only be with respect to our persons; for\r\nas to affection, mine for you will continue to my latest breath. This\r\nevent will probably surprise you; but from your knowledge of me, I rely\r\nyou will conclude, at the instant, that no light considerations would\r\nhave taken me from the army; and I think I might safely have rested the\r\nmatter here. However, as the friendship between us gives you a claim\r\nto something more, and as I am not indifferent about character, and\r\nshall be anxious to have the esteem of all who are good, and virtuously\r\ngreat, I shall detail to you, my friend, the more substantial reasons\r\nwhich have led to my present conduct. I go from the army, then, because\r\nI have found, on examination, that my little fortune, earned by an\r\nhonest and hard industry, was becoming embarrassed--to attend to the\r\neducation of my children--to provide, if possible, for the payment of\r\na considerable sum of sterling money and interest, with which I stand\r\ncharged, on account of the land I lately received from my honored\r\nfather, for equality of partition between myself and two brothers--to\r\nsave a house which he had begun, and which, without instant attention,\r\nwould be ruined, or at least greatly injured--to provide, if possible,\r\nfor the payment of goods, which far exceed any profits I can make from\r\nmy estate--and because the State of Maryland, in a flattering manner,\r\nhave been pleased to appoint me to a place, very respectable in its\r\nnature, corresponding with my former, and very interesting to my\r\nwhole future life and support. They have appointed me to the Chair of\r\ntheir Supreme Court. These, my friend, are the motives to my present\r\nresolution. My own feelings are satisfied on the occasion, though\r\nI cannot but regret parting with the most valuable acquaintances I\r\nhave; and I hope they will justify me most fully to you, my Hamilton,\r\nespecially when you consider, besides, the time I have been in service,\r\nand the compensation I have received. I wish, seriously, I had been\r\nsooner apprised of the good intentions of the State towards me, for\r\nreasons which will occur to you. They were but very lately known, and\r\nI was no sooner possessed of them, than I communicated the matter (that\r\nI should leave the army) to the General--having found, on inquiry,\r\nit was only in my power to accept the offer of the Chair, or decline\r\nit for ever, as the filling it had become a measure of immediate\r\nnecessity; and there were other gentlemen, both of ability and merit,\r\nwho had been mentioned for it, and who would probably have willingly\r\naccepted it. You are now to pardon me for this long relation, so very\r\npersonal. You must do it, as what I owed to your friendship produced\r\nit, and as it is my hope and wish to stand fair in your opinion and\r\nesteem.\r\n\r\nI proceed to tell you that I live in Charles County, Maryland, where\r\nI should be peculiarly happy to see you: but as I can have but little\r\nhopes of being gratified in this, let me have the next pleasure to\r\nit, the favor of a letter now and then; in which, write of matters\r\npersonally interesting to yourself, as they will be so to me. Present\r\nme most respectfully to your lady, to General and Mrs. Schuyler. My\r\nbest wishes attend you all. Adieu.\r\n\r\n                                    Yours in haste, most affectionately,\r\n                                    Robt. H. Harrison.\r\n\r\nColonel Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLA FAYETTE TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                           Elk, April 10, 1781.\r\n\r\nWhere is, for the present, my dear Hamilton? This question is not a\r\nmere affair of curiosity. It is not even wholly owing to the tender\r\nsentiments of my friendship. But motives both of a public and private\r\nnature conspire in making me wish that your woe be not accomplished.\r\nPerhaps you are at head quarters--perhaps at Albany; at all events,\r\nI’ll tell you my history. Had the French fleet come in, Arnold was\r\nours. The more certain it was, the greater my disappointment has been;\r\nat last it has become necessary for them to return to Rhode Island. I\r\nthink they have exerted themselves for the common good, and this has\r\nbeen a comfort in our misfortune.\r\n\r\nHaving luckily arrived at Elk by water, which at first I had no right\r\nto expect, I have received the General’s letters. If you are at head\r\nquarters, you will have seen my correspondence with the General; if\r\nnot, I tell you that I am ordered to the southern army, and the General\r\nthinks that the army under his immediate command will remain inactive.\r\nAfter a march of forty days, we will arrive at a time when the heat\r\nof the season will put an end to operations. This detachment is so\r\ncircumstanced as to make it very inconvenient for officers and men to\r\nproceed. Before we arrive, we shall perhaps be reduced to five or six\r\nhundred men. There will be no light infantry formed--no attack against\r\nNew-York--none of those things which had flattered my mind. If a corps\r\nis sent to the southward by land, it ought to have been the Jersey\r\nline, because if we weaken ourselves, New-York will be out of the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Destouches will, I think, propose to the General to send to\r\nPhiladelphia l’Eveillé and all the frigates; these, with the frigates\r\nnow at Philadelphia, would carry fifteen hundred men to whatever\r\npart of the continent the General would think proper. We could then\r\ngo to Morristown, there to form a new corps of light infantry upon\r\nthe principles at first intended, and embarking in the first days of\r\nMay, we could be at Wilmington, Georgetown, or any where else, sooner\r\nthan we can now be by land. I would have the battalions composed of\r\nsix companies; Colonels employed--Webb, Sprout, Huntington, Olney,\r\nHill, Barber, Gimat, _Laurens_; Majors Willet, Fish, Gibbes, Inspector\r\nSmith, and another; Brigadier Generals Huntington and Scamell, and\r\na good corps of artillerists under * * * * * *. My good friend, you\r\nwould be more important at head quarters; but if you don’t stay there,\r\nyou know what you have promised to me. Adieu. Write often and long\r\nletters. It is probable I will be in the southern wilderness until the\r\nend of the war, far from head quarters, from the French army, from my\r\ncorrespondence with France; but the whole good I could have operated,\r\nin this last instance, must have taken place by this time. My best\r\nrespects and affectionate compliments wait on Mrs. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n                                                    Most friendly yours,\r\n                                                    La Fayette.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLA FAYETTE TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   April 15, 1781. Susquehanna.\r\n\r\nDear Hamilton:\r\n\r\nYou are so sensible a fellow, that you certainly can explain to me what\r\nis the matter that New-York is given up; that our letters to France go\r\nfor nothing; that while the French are coming, I am going. This last\r\nmatter gives great uneasiness to the Minister of France. All this is\r\nnot comprehensible to me, who, having been long from head quarters,\r\nhave lost the course of intelligence.\r\n\r\nHave you left the family, my dear sir? I suppose so; but from love to\r\nthe General, for whom you know my affection, I ardently wish it was not\r\nthe case; many, many reasons conspire to this desire of mine. But if\r\nyou do leave it, and if I go to exile, come and partake it with me.\r\n\r\n                                                                  Yours,\r\n                                                                  L. F.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOL. TILGHMAN TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Head Quarters, 27th April, 1781.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Hamilton:\r\n\r\nBetween me and thee there is a gulf, or I should not have been thus\r\nlong without seeing you. My faith is strong, but not strong enough to\r\nattempt walking upon the waters. You must not suppose from my dealing\r\nso much in Scripture phrases, that I am either drunk with religion or\r\nwith wine, though had I been inclined to the latter, I might have found\r\na jolly companion in my Lord, who came here yesterday.\r\n\r\nWe have not a word of news. Whenever any arrives worth communicating,\r\nand good, you shall have it instantly--if bad, I will not promise so\r\nmuch dispatch.\r\n\r\nI must go over and see you soon, for I am not yet weaned from you, nor\r\ndo I desire to be. I will not present so cold words as compliments to\r\nMrs. Hamilton. She has an equal share of the best wishes of\r\n\r\n                                                 Your most affectionate,\r\n                                                 Tilghman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            De Peyster’s Point, April 27, 1781.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nI imagine your Excellency has been informed, that in consequence of\r\nthe resolution of Congress for granting commissions to Aid-de-Camps\r\nappointed under the former establishment, I have obtained one of\r\nLieutenant Colonel in the army of the United States, bearing rank since\r\nthe 1st of March, 1777.\r\n\r\nIt is become necessary to me to apply to your Excellency, to know in\r\nwhat manner you foresee you will be able to employ me in the ensuing\r\ncampaign. I am ready to enter into activity whenever you think proper,\r\nthough I am not anxious to do it till the army takes the field, as\r\nbefore that period I perceive no object.\r\n\r\nUnconnected as I am with any regiment, I can have no other command than\r\nin a light corps; and I flatter myself my pretensions to this are good.\r\n\r\nYour Excellency knows, I have been in actual service since the\r\nbeginning of ’76. I began in the line, and had I continued there, I\r\nought, in justice, to have been more advanced in rank than I now am.\r\nI believe my conduct, in the different capacities in which I have\r\nacted, has appeared to the officers of the army, in general, such as\r\nto merit their confidence and esteem; and I cannot suppose them to\r\nbe so ungenerous as not to see me with pleasure put into a situation\r\nstill to exercise the disposition I have always had of being useful\r\nto the United States. I mention these things, only to show that I do\r\nnot apprehend the same difficulties can exist in my case (which is\r\npeculiar), that have opposed the appointments to commands of some other\r\nofficers, not belonging to what is called the line. Though the light\r\ninfantry is chiefly formed, yet being detached to the southward, I take\r\nit for granted there will be a vanguard by detachment formed for this\r\narmy.\r\n\r\n                                     I have the honor to be,\r\n                                     Very respectfully,\r\n                                     Your Excellency’s most ob’t serv’t,\r\n                                     A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nTo General Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   New Windsor, April 27, 1781.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nYour letter of this date has not a little embarrassed me. You must\r\nremember the ferment in the Pennsylvania line last campaign, occasioned\r\nby the appointment of Major M’Pherson; and you know the uneasiness\r\nwhich at this moment exists among the eastern officers, on account of\r\nthe commands conferred upon Colonel Gimat and Major Galvan, although it\r\nwas the result of absolute necessity.\r\n\r\nShould circumstances admit of the formation of another advanced corps,\r\nof which I see very little prospect, from present appearances, it can\r\nbe but small, and must be composed almost entirely of eastern troops:\r\nand to add to the discontents of the officers of those lines, by the\r\nfurther appointment of an officer of your rank to the command of\r\nit, or in it, would, I am certain, involve me in a difficulty of a\r\nvery disagreeable and delicate nature; and might, perhaps, lead to\r\nconsequences more serious than it is easy to imagine. While I adhere\r\nfirmly to the right of making such appointments as you request, I am\r\nat the same time obliged to reflect, that it will not do to push that\r\nright too far; more especially in a service like ours, and at a time so\r\ncritical as the present.\r\n\r\nI am convinced that no officer can, with justice, dispute your merit\r\nand abilities. The opposition heretofore made, has not been for the\r\nwant of those qualifications in the gentlemen who are, and have been,\r\nthe objects of discontent. The officers of the line contend, without\r\nhaving reference to particular persons, that it is a hardship and\r\nreflection upon them, to introduce brevet officers into commands\r\n(of some permanency), in which there are more opportunities of\r\ndistinguishing themselves than in the line of the army at large, and\r\nwith the men they have had the trouble to discipline and to prepare for\r\nthe field.\r\n\r\nMy principal concern arises from an apprehension, that you will\r\nimpute my refusal of your request to other motives than those I have\r\nexpressed; but I beg you to be assured, I am only influenced by the\r\nreasons which I have mentioned.\r\n\r\n                                          I am, dear Sir,\r\n                                          Your obedient, humble servant,\r\n                                          G. Washington.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHUYLER TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      Saratoga, April 29, 1781.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe troops here are destitute of meat, and I fear will abandon the\r\npost; the inhabitants in consternation, and preparing to fly, since\r\nthey have heard of the arrival of some of the enemy’s shipping at\r\nCrown Point. Flour we can procure for the present, I having, on my own\r\naccount, purchased one hundred barrels about twelve miles from this. If\r\nbeef is sent up so as to enable the troops to remain, an engineer will\r\nbe absolutely necessary to construct two or three small fortifications.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                      I am, dear Sir,\r\n                                      Most affectionately and sincerely,\r\n                                      Yours, etc., etc.,\r\n                                      Ph. Schuyler.\r\n\r\nCol. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO ROBERT MORRIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                         April 30, 1781.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nI was among the first who were convinced that an administration, by\r\nsingle men, was essential to the proper management of the affairs of\r\nthis country. I am persuaded, now, it is the only resource we have, to\r\nextricate ourselves from the distresses which threaten the subversion\r\nof our cause. It is palpable, that the people have lost all confidence\r\nin our public councils; and it is a fact, of which I dare say you are\r\nas well apprised as myself, that our friends in Europe are in the same\r\ndisposition. I have been in a situation that has enabled me to obtain a\r\nbetter idea of this than most others; and I venture to assert, that the\r\nCourt of France will never give half the succors to this country, while\r\nCongress hold the reins of administration in their own hands, which\r\nthey would grant, if these were intrusted to individuals of established\r\nreputation, and conspicuous for probity, abilities, and fortune.\r\n\r\nWith respect to ourselves, there is so universal and rooted a\r\ndiffidence of the government, that, if we could be assured the future\r\nmeasures of Congress would be dictated by the most perfect wisdom and\r\npublic spirit, there would be still a necessity for a change in the\r\nforms of our administration, to give a new spring and current to the\r\npassions and hopes of the people. To me it appears evident, that an\r\nexecutive ministry, composed of men with the qualifications I have\r\ndescribed, would speedily restore the credit of government abroad\r\nand at home--would induce our allies to greater exertions in our\r\nbehalf--would inspire confidence in moneyed men in Europe, as well as\r\nin America, to lend us those sums of which it may be demonstrated we\r\nstand in need, from the disproportion of our national wealth to the\r\nexpenses of the war.\r\n\r\nI hope, sir, you will not consider it as a compliment, when I assure\r\nyou that I heard, with the greatest satisfaction, of your nomination\r\nto the department of finance. In a letter of mine, last summer, to Mr.\r\nDuane, urging, among other things, the plan of an executive ministry, I\r\nmentioned you as the person who ought to fill that department. I know\r\nof no other in America, who unites so many advantages; and of course\r\nevery impediment to your acceptance, is to me a subject of chagrin. I\r\nflatter myself Congress will not preclude the public from your services\r\nby an obstinate refusal of reasonable conditions; and, as one deeply\r\ninterested in the event, I am happy in believing you will not easily\r\nbe discouraged from undertaking an office, by which you may render\r\nAmerica, and the world, no less a service than the establishment of\r\nAmerican independence! ’Tis by introducing order into our finances--by\r\nrestoring public credit--not by gaining battles, that we are finally to\r\ngain our object. ’Tis by putting ourselves in a condition to continue\r\nthe war--not by temporary, violent, and unnatural efforts to bring it\r\nto a decisive issue, that we shall, in reality, bring it to a speedy\r\nand successful one. In the frankness of truth I believe, sir, you are\r\nthe man best capable of performing this great work.\r\n\r\nIn expectation that all difficulties will be removed, and that you\r\nwill ultimately act on terms you approve, I take the liberty to submit\r\nto you some ideas, relative to the objects of your department. I\r\npretend not to be an able financier: it is a part of administration\r\nwhich has been least in my way, and, of course, has least occupied my\r\ninquiries and reflections. Neither have I had leisure or materials to\r\nmake accurate calculations. I have been obliged to depend on memory\r\nfor important facts, for want of the authorities from which they are\r\ndrawn. With all these disadvantages, my plan must necessarily be crude\r\nand defective; but if it may be a basis for something more perfect, or\r\nif it contains any hints that may be of use to you, the trouble I have\r\ntaken myself, or may give you, will not be misapplied. At any rate, the\r\nconfidence I have in your judgment, assures me that you will receive,\r\nwith pleasure, communications of this sort: if they contain any thing\r\nuseful, they will promote your views and the public benefit; if not,\r\nthe only evil is the trouble of reading them; and the best informed\r\nwill frequently derive lights, even from reveries of projectors and\r\nquacks. There is scarcely any plan so bad as not to have something good\r\nin it. I trust mine to your candor without further apology; you will at\r\nleast do justice to my intention.\r\n\r\nThe first step towards determining what ought to be done in the\r\nfinances of this country, is to estimate, in the best manner we can,\r\nits capacity for revenue; and the proportion between what it is able to\r\nafford, and what it stands in need of, for the expenses of its civil\r\nand military establishments. There occur to me two ways of doing this:\r\n1st. By examining what proportion the revenues of other countries have\r\nborne to their stock of wealth, and applying the rule to ourselves,\r\nwith proper allowance for the difference of circumstances. 2d. By\r\ncomparing the result of this rule with the product of taxes in those\r\nStates which have been the most in earnest in taxation. The reason for\r\nhaving recourse to the first method is, that our own experience of our\r\nfaculties in this respect, has not been sufficiently clear, or uniform,\r\nto admit of a certain conclusion: so that it will be more satisfactory\r\nto judge of them by a general principle, drawn by the example of other\r\nnations, compared with what we have effected ourselves, than to rely\r\nentirely upon the latter.\r\n\r\nThe nations with whose wealth and revenues we are best acquainted, are\r\nFrance, Great Britain, and the United Provinces. The real wealth of a\r\nnation, consisting in its labor and commodities, is to be estimated\r\nby the sign of that wealth--its circulating cash. There may be times\r\nwhen, from particular accidents, the quantity of this may exceed or\r\nfall short of a just representative; but it will turn again to a proper\r\nlevel, and, in the general course of things, maintain itself in that\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nThe circulation of France is almost wholly carried on in the precious\r\nmetals; and its current cash is estimated at from fifteen to sixteen\r\nhundred millions of livres. The net revenue of the kingdom, the sum\r\nwhich actually passes into the public coffers, is somewhere between\r\nthree hundred and sixty and four hundred millions, about one fourth of\r\nthe whole of its currency. An estimate of the wealth of this nation\r\nis liable to less fallacy than of that of the other two, as it makes\r\nlittle use of paper credit, which may be artificially increased, and\r\neven supported, a long time beyond its natural bounds.\r\n\r\nIt is supposed that the gross sum extracted from the people by the\r\ncollectors of the revenue, may be one-third more than that which goes\r\ninto the treasury: but as their exactions are excessive, and fall too\r\nheavy on particular orders, who are by that means reduced to indigence\r\nand misery, it is to be inferred, that, with moderate and reasonable\r\nexpenses of collection, the present revenue is as great as the kingdom\r\ncan well afford, from its present quantity of wealth.\r\n\r\nThe circulating cash of Great Britain, in paper and specie, may be\r\nstated at about forty millions of pounds sterling. Mr. Hume supposes\r\nit to have been, at the time he wrote his Essay on the Balance of\r\nTrade, about thirty millions. Other writers have carried it to fifty,\r\nand it is probably in a medium that we shall find the truth. I do not\r\ninclude in this, the whole amount of Bank notes, Exchequer bills,\r\nIndia bonds, etc. etc.; but only such part as is really employed in\r\ncommon circulation, and performs the offices of current cash. In ’75,\r\nby Dr. Price’s statement, the net revenue of Great Britain was ten\r\nmillions--that is, about one-fourth of its current cash, as in France.\r\n\r\nI have never met with any calculation that might be depended upon, of\r\nthe current cash of the Seven Provinces. Almost the whole of their\r\ncoin, as well as large quantities of plate and bullion, are shut up\r\nin the Bank of Amsterdam. The real wealth of the Bank is believed to\r\nbe about fifteen millions sterling; though, upon the strength of\r\nthis fund, it has a credit almost unlimited, that answers all the\r\npurposes of cash in trade. As the Dutch, by their prudent maxims, have\r\ncommonly the rate of exchange throughout Europe in their favor, and\r\na considerable balance of trade, the use of paper credit (which, in\r\npart, also depends upon the particular nature of their Banks) has not\r\nthe same tendency with them, as in England, to banish the precious\r\nmetals. We may therefore suppose these to be here, as in France, the\r\ntrue sign of the wealth of the nation. If to the fifteen millions in\r\nBank, we add two millions of specie for the retail circulation and\r\nvarious transactions of business, we shall, I imagine, have nearly the\r\ntrue stock of wealth of the United Provinces. Their revenues amount\r\nto something more than four millions, and bear the same proportion to\r\nthe stock from which they are drawn, as those of France and England.\r\nI confess, however, the data, in their case, are not sufficiently\r\nascertained to permit us to rely equally on the result. From these\r\nthree examples we may venture to deduce this general rule,--that the\r\nproportion of revenue which a nation is capable of affording, is\r\nabout one-fourth of its circulating cash, so far as this is a just\r\nrepresentative of its labor and commodities.\r\n\r\nThis is only applicable to commercial countries, because, in those\r\nwhich are not so, the circulating cash is not an adequate sign. A great\r\npart of domestic commerce is carried on by barter; and the State must\r\nreceive a part of its dues in the labor and commodities themselves. The\r\nproportion, however, of the revenues of such a State to the aggregate\r\nof its labor and commodities, ought to be the same as in the case\r\nof trading nations to their circulating cash; with this difference,\r\nthat the difficulty of collection and transportation, the waste and\r\nembezzlement inseparable from this mode of revenue, would make the real\r\nadvantage and ultimate gain to the State, infinitely less than when the\r\npublic dues are paid in cash.\r\n\r\nWhen I say that one-fourth part of its stock of wealth is the revenue\r\nwhich a nation is capable of affording to the government, I must be\r\nunderstood in a qualified, not in an absolute sense. It would be\r\npresumptuous to fix a precise boundary to the ingenuity of financiers,\r\nor to the patience of the people: but this we may safely say, that\r\ntaxation is already carried, in the nations we have been speaking of;\r\nto an extent which does not admit of a very considerable increase\r\nwithout a proportionable increase of industry. This suffices for a\r\nstandard to us; and we may proceed to the application.\r\n\r\nFrom a comparison of the several estimates I have seen, of the quantity\r\nof current cash in this country previous to the war (specie and paper),\r\nI have settled my opinion of the amount at thirty millions of dollars,\r\nof which about eight might have been in specie: one-fourth of this, by\r\nanalogy, was at that time the proper revenue of these States; that is,\r\nseven and a half millions of dollars.\r\n\r\nAs taxation, however, has, by slow gradations, been carried to an\r\nextreme in those countries which I have chosen as examples, that would\r\nnot be, but in a course of time, practicable in this, where the people\r\nhave been so little accustomed to taxes, it may be doubted whether\r\nit would be possible to raise the same proportion of revenue here.\r\nThe object of the war, I imagine, would supply the want of habit,\r\nand reconcile the minds of the people to paying to the utmost of\r\ntheir abilities, provided the taxes were judiciously imposed, and the\r\nrevenues wisely administered. Besides this, there is a circumstance\r\nin our favor, which puts it in the power of government to raise an\r\nequal proportion of revenue without burthening the lower classes of\r\nthe people in the same degree as in Europe. This circumstance is the\r\nmuch greater equality of fortunes, by which means men, in this country,\r\nmay be made to contribute to the public exigencies in a much juster\r\nproportion to their property; and this is in fact the case. In France\r\nthe rich have gained so entire an ascendant, that there is a constant\r\nsacrifice of the ease and happiness of the people to their avarice and\r\nluxury: their burthens are in no proportion to those of the middle\r\norder, and still less to those of the poor. In England and Holland the\r\ncase, though not altogether, is in a great measure the same. There are\r\nalso men of very large moneyed capitals, which were either formerly\r\nexempt from taxes by being in the public funds, or, having no visible\r\nrepresentative for taxation to operate upon, enjoy virtually the same\r\nadvantages. But if, at the commencement of the war, the ability of\r\nthese States for revenue may be rated at seven and a half millions of\r\ndollars, when the amount of its circulating cash was thirty millions,\r\nnow that it is reduced more than one-half in real value, to what\r\nrevenue are they to be supposed equal at this time? I should judge\r\nabout one-fifth less, and not more.\r\n\r\nThe diminution of our circulating cash is principally artificial. It is\r\ntrue, our foreign commerce has declined by the war, but our domestic\r\ncommerce has increased. I know of no good reason to believe, that the\r\nquantity of labor and commodities have been materially diminished. Our\r\nexports have lessened, but our internal consumption has augmented. The\r\nmen employed in the army, and in the departments connected with it,\r\nconsume and waste three times as much as the same number of men in\r\ncivil life. A number of husbandmen have been taken from their ploughs\r\ninto military service; but the progress of our natural population\r\nhas, in part, supplied their place; and the demands of the war have\r\nincreased individual industry. The great influx of money, at first\r\noperated upon the avarice of the people, and, for a long time, served\r\nalso as a stimulus to industry, which taxation has since kept up on the\r\nprinciple of necessity. Notwithstanding the demands and competitions of\r\ntwo armies for supplies, we see that corn, which is the staple of these\r\nmiddle States, is cheaper than for some years before the war; a strong\r\nargument of plenty.\r\n\r\nWe may infer from all this, that we stand in need now of nearly the\r\nsame quantity of medium for our circulation as before the war. The\r\ndepreciation of the money below the standard, is to be attributed to\r\na want of confidence rather than to a decay of resources. We find the\r\npeople, in some of the States, distressed to pay their taxes, for\r\nwant of money, with ample means otherwise; which is a proof, that\r\nour current cash is not a competent representative of the labor and\r\ncommodities of the country. Another proof of the same nature is, that\r\nparticular States who have found no small difficulty in collecting\r\ntheir pecuniary taxes, have been successful in raising contributions\r\nto a large amount in kind. This country never having been a country of\r\nmanufactures, the productions of the soil ever were, as they still are,\r\nthe principal source of revenue. The inhabitants have abridged their\r\nwants of foreign articles, from the scarcity of them, and have, in\r\npart, supplied their place by home manufactures; which, being chiefly\r\nconducted by the women, take nothing from the labor appropriated to\r\nagriculture, while it enables the farmer to spare a larger portion of\r\nhis income to the public.\r\n\r\nWhatever diminution our means of revenue may have suffered, must\r\nbe accounted for on the decay of foreign trade, and on the loss of\r\nterritory. The imposts on trade in Great Britain amounted to about a\r\nfourth of its total revenue. The proportion must be less in America.\r\nBut suppose it to be the same; suppose our external commerce to\r\nbe reduced one-half, which I believe is an ample allowance, then,\r\none-eighth should be deducted from our revenue on this account; which\r\nwould bring it down to six millions, five hundred and sixty-two\r\nthousand, five hundred dollars. Allow for the loss of Georgia and\r\nSouth Carolina one-eighth of this sum: this would reduce the income\r\nof the remaining States to five millions, seven hundred and forty-two\r\nthousand, one hundred and eighty-eight, and four-eighths, dollars.\r\nBut as the allowance, in both cases, is large, the diminution I have\r\nalready supposed, of one-fifth of the whole, appears to be nearest the\r\ntruth; which leaves these States with a net revenue of six millions of\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nWe will now examine how far this rule agrees with experience, and with\r\nwhat has already been effected in these States. Massachusetts may serve\r\nas a criterion. This is one of the States where taxation has been\r\ncarried furthest. Taxes were so heavy last year, that I am informed\r\nthere were real marks of distress among some classes of the people. The\r\nLegislature, in their late Address, tell us that they amounted to six\r\nhundred thousand pounds lawful: and they appear to have thought the\r\npressure of them too great, by reducing them at a time when they are\r\nobliged to have recourse to a large loan, to answer the exigencies of\r\nthe current year.\r\n\r\nThe taxes they specify which seem to belong to those of the present\r\nyear, with the addition of the bounties for raising men, and the beef\r\nsupply, may be estimated at near five hundred thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nThis State is in a different situation from any other. Its position\r\nhas made it impossible for the enemy to intercept its trade; while\r\nthat of all the others has been greatly injured or totally obstructed.\r\nIt has become, in consequence, the mart of the States northward of\r\nPennsylvania; and its commerce has enlarged itself much beyond its\r\nformer limits. A great part of the money expended for the support of\r\nthe war, has been disbursed there. Congress, in their requisitions for\r\nmoney, have rated the quota of Massachusetts at     of the whole;\r\nbut I believe its ability, at this time, is in the proportion of\r\none-fifth. I found this estimation on an impartial comparison of the\r\ncircumstances of the several States.\r\n\r\nAdmitting the proportion to be just, and taking the taxes of the\r\npresent year as a standard, the gross amount of our collective revenues\r\nwould be two millions, five hundred thousand pounds lawful; or eight\r\nmillions, three hundred and thirty-three thousand, three hundred and\r\nthirty-three, and one-third, dollars. The expense of collection, in\r\nEngland, is about the ninth of the gross amount; and considering\r\nthat our revenue is to be raised in eleven different governments,\r\neach having a complete set of collectors of its own, the expense of\r\ncollection, with us, will in all probability be not much less than it\r\nis in England. Supposing it to be the same, and that the taxes were to\r\nprove as productive as their nominal amount, our net revenue would then\r\nbe seven millions, four hundred and seven thousand, four hundred and\r\neight, and one-half, dollars; which considerably exceeds what it ought\r\nto be by my first calculation.\r\n\r\nBut there are considerations which may induce us to make large\r\ndeductions from this sum. When the Legislature tells us, that the\r\ntaxes of last year amounted to six hundred thousand pounds, it also\r\ntells us that there was _a part_ of them still to be levied; which,\r\namong other things, had occasioned them to postpone the next tax to a\r\nfuture session. Whatever is due on the last year, may be considered,\r\nin effect, as an anticipation on the taxes of the present; for it takes\r\noff so much from the ability of the people to pay them. The chances\r\nare, that the additional impositions projected for the current year\r\nwill not be raised in their full extent. Taxes are seldom or never so\r\nproductive as their estimated value; and in a case like this, must be\r\nexpected to be more than commonly deficient.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed, also, that the last year was a year of peculiar\r\nexertion. There was a general expectation of some attempt, in\r\nconjunction with our allies, decisive of the war. This made the people\r\nstrain their efforts beyond their natural abilities: and yet they did\r\nnot comply with the demands of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nThe money for the bounties this year, which I have calculated at\r\nsixty thousand pounds,[12] may, in like manner, be regarded as an\r\nextraordinary and special contribution, which the people may be willing\r\nto submit to, over and above what they could probably afford to pay, to\r\nget rid of the insupportable inconvenience of temporary enlistments.\r\n\r\nReasonable deductions on these accounts being made, will bring the two\r\ncalculations to a pretty exact agreement, and make them confirm each\r\nother. But were not this the case, I should be inclined, in preference,\r\nto trust the first, as being founded on a basis better known and better\r\nascertained by experience. I believe, however, we may safely conclude,\r\nfrom both, that between six and seven millions of dollars is the proper\r\nrevenue of these States, after the dismemberment of South Carolina and\r\nGeorgia.\r\n\r\nHaving formed an estimate of our ability for revenue, the next thing\r\nto be ascertained is, the annual expense of our civil and military\r\nestablishments. With tolerable economy, I should suppose two millions\r\nand a half of dollars would amply suffice for the first, including the\r\nparticular administration of each State. For the second, judiciously\r\nmanaged, eight millions of dollars would be adequate, calculating for\r\nan army of twenty thousand men, which are as many as we shall stand in\r\nneed of, or be able[13] to raise. Eleven millions of dollars will be\r\nthen the amount of the annual expenses of these States. I speak on a\r\nsupposition that a system were embraced, well adapted to rescuing our\r\naffairs from the chaos in which they are now involved; and which, while\r\nit continues, must baffle all calculation.\r\n\r\nThe difference between our revenues and expenses, on the preceding\r\nscale, will be from four to four and a half millions of dollars; which\r\ndeficiency must of course be supplied by credit, foreign or domestic,\r\nor both.\r\n\r\nWith regard to credit abroad, I think we have little chance of\r\nobtaining a sufficiency, nearly to answer our purpose. France, by all\r\nthe reforms she can make in her interior economy, by all the means\r\nshe can procure in loans and lotteries, in addition to her revenue,\r\ncan do little more than satisfy her own wants. The death of the\r\nEmpress Queen, and the notorious hostility of the Emperor, will add\r\nto the number of these. She will, in all probability, be obliged to\r\npay greater attention to her army, which has been neglected, for\r\nseveral years past, to apply all the resources of the kingdom to\r\nthe improvement of the navy. Though Russia and Prussia, by the last\r\nadvices, seemed disposed to control the ill-humor of the Emperor,\r\nFrance will hardly think it prudent to leave herself in a defenceless\r\ncondition, relying on the precarious friendship and momentary interests\r\nof other powers. The increase of her army will necessarily increase her\r\nexpenses, as she cannot, in the present state of things, retrench any\r\nthing from the navy; and of course she will have less money to spare\r\nto allies. It has been observed, that France has hitherto imposed none\r\nof the additional taxes usual in time of war; by doing which, it is\r\nimagined she would have it in her power, not only to supply her own\r\nwants better, but to contribute largely to ours. To this it has been\r\nanswered, with great appearance of reason, that the credit of the\r\nfinancier very much depends on his having such a resource in reserve,\r\nwhich, being considered as a mean he may command, when necessary, to\r\nfulfil his engagements, disposes moneyed men to lend to him with the\r\ngreater freedom and confidence. The breaking in upon that resource,\r\ntherefore (it is said), would injure credit, and obstruct loans in a\r\ndegree that could not be compensated by the direct value of the revenue\r\nit would furnish.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, however, from a variety of siftings and inquiries, I\r\nshould be mistaken if France did not lend this country eight or ten\r\nmillions of livres annually, during the war; provided its finances were\r\nonce put upon a reasonable footing: but this is not above a third of\r\nour wants.\r\n\r\nI find no reason to flatter ourselves that we have much to expect\r\neither from the ability or inclination of Spain. Her government is far\r\nfrom being so rich as is vulgarly imagined. The mines of South America,\r\nof late years, have been less liberal of their profits; and, for fear\r\nof accidents, but a small part of their product, since the war, has\r\nbeen imported into Europe. The extreme indolence of the Spaniards,\r\nand their neglect of agriculture, manufactures, and trade, make them\r\ntributary to their more industrious neighbors, who drain them of their\r\nprecious metals as fast as they arrive.\r\n\r\nBut if they were heartily disposed to do it, they might still afford\r\nus some assistance. Their conduct, hitherto, has manifested no such\r\ndisposition: it has been as cold and reserved as it could well be.\r\nThe bills drawn upon them have not been rejected, but they have not\r\nbeen paid. Their permitting the residence of a British emissary among\r\nthem, and the countenance they give him, unprecedented in a state of\r\nwar, afford just room for a distrust of their intentions, though it\r\nmay be nothing more than a stroke of policy, to play him off against\r\nour negotiations, and make us bid higher for their friendship. Their\r\nmethod of prosecuting the war is passive, to a degree that can scarcely\r\nbe resolved even into Spanish supineness; but seems to have a more\r\ncorrupt original. A bigoted prince, governed by a greedy confessor, is\r\na character on which little dependence can be placed.\r\n\r\n’Tis not on Spain, then, that we are to build our hopes of any\r\nconsiderable succors in money.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch government has of long standing mortgaged all its revenues.\r\nTaxation has been carried to a length that admits of little extension.\r\n’Tis from its credit with its own citizens, that it must derive the\r\nmeans of making war. It has every thing to do. Its fleet is to be in a\r\nmanner created anew; and its land forces to be recruited, having been,\r\nfor some time past, suffered to decline very much. It will, therefore,\r\nstand in need of all its credit for its own uses. Of course we have\r\nnothing to expect from the government of that country.\r\n\r\nThe individuals will not have confidence enough in our public councils,\r\nto embark any considerable part of their fortunes with us, on the\r\nordinary principles of a loan. Stronger inducements, the prospect of\r\ncommercial advantages, securities different from the mere faith of the\r\nUnited States, must be held out, to tempt them to engage far with us.\r\nThe plan I am going to propose, endeavors to conciliate these objects.\r\n\r\nAs to internal loans, on which, after all, we must chiefly depend,\r\nthere are two things that operate against them, to any large amount;\r\nthe want of a sufficient number of men, with sufficient moneyed\r\ncapitals to lend the sums required, and the want of confidence in those\r\nwho are able to lend, to make them willing to part with their money. It\r\nmay be added, that they can employ it to greater advantage in traffic,\r\nthan by merely lending it on interest.\r\n\r\nTo surmount these obstacles, and give individuals ability and\r\ninclination to lend, in any proportion to the wants of government, a\r\nplan must be devised, which, by incorporating their means together,\r\nand uniting them with those of the public, will, on the foundation of\r\nthat incorporation and union, erect a mass of credit that will supply\r\nthe defect of moneyed capital, and answer all the purposes of cash; a\r\nplan which will offer adventurers immediate advantages, analogous to\r\nthose they receive by employing their money in trade, and, eventually,\r\ngreater advantages; a plan which will give them the greatest security\r\nthe nature of the case will admit for what they lend; and which will\r\nnot only advance their own interest, and secure the independence of\r\ntheir country, but, in its progress, have the most beneficial influence\r\nupon its future commerce, and be a source of national strength and\r\nwealth.\r\n\r\nI mean the institution of a NATIONAL BANK. This I regard, in some shape\r\nor other, as an expedient essential to our safety and success; unless,\r\nby a happy turn of European affairs, the war should speedily terminate\r\nin a manner upon which it would be unwise to reckon. There is no other\r\nthat can give to government that extensive and systematic credit,\r\nwhich the defect of our revenues makes indispensably necessary to its\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nThe longer it is delayed, the more difficult it becomes. Our affairs\r\ngrow every day more relaxed and more involved; public credit hastens\r\nto a more irretrievable catastrophe; the means for executing the plan\r\nare exhausted in partial and temporary efforts. The loan now making in\r\nMassachusetts would have gone a great way in establishing the funds on\r\nwhich the Bank must stand.\r\n\r\nI am aware of all the objections that have been made to public Banks;\r\nand that they are not without enlightened and respectable opponents.\r\nBut all that has been said against them, only tends to prove that,\r\nlike all other good things, they are subject to abuse, and, when\r\nabused, become pernicious. The precious metals, by similar arguments,\r\nmay be proven to be injurious. It is certain that the mines of South\r\nAmerica have had great influence in banishing industry from Spain, and\r\nsinking it in real wealth and importance. Great power, commerce, and\r\nriches, or, in other words, great national prosperity, may, in like\r\nmanner, be denominated evils; for they lead to insolence, an inordinate\r\nambition, a vicious luxury, licentiousness of morals, and all those\r\nvices which corrupt government, enslave the people, and precipitate\r\nthe ruin of a nation. But no wise statesman will reject the good, from\r\nan apprehension of the ill. The truth is, in human affairs there is\r\nno good, pure and unmixed: every advantage has two sides: and wisdom\r\nconsists in availing ourselves of the good, and guarding as much as\r\npossible against the bad.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of a National Bank is to increase public and private\r\ncredit. The former gives power to the State, for the protection of\r\nits rights and interests: and the latter facilitates and extends the\r\noperations of commerce among individuals. Industry is increased,\r\ncommodities are multiplied, agriculture and manufactures flourish: and\r\nherein consists the true wealth and prosperity of a State.\r\n\r\nMost commercial nations have found it necessary to institute Banks: and\r\nthey have proved to be the happiest engines that ever were invented for\r\nadvancing trade. Venice, Genoa, Hamburgh, Holland, and England, are\r\nexamples of their utility. They owe their riches, commerce, and the\r\nfigure they have made at different periods, in a great degree to this\r\nsource. Great Britain is indebted for the immense efforts she has been\r\nable to make, in so many illustrious and successful wars, essentially\r\nto that vast fabric of credit raised on this foundation. ’Tis by this\r\nalone she now menaces our independence.\r\n\r\nShe has, indeed, abused the advantage, and now stands on a precipice.\r\nHer example should both persuade and warn us. ’Tis in republics where\r\nBanks are most easily established and supported, and where they are\r\nleast liable to abuse. Our situation will not expose us to frequent\r\nwars; and the public will have no temptation to overstrain its credit.\r\nIn my opinion, we ought not to hesitate, because we have no other\r\nresource. The long and expensive wars of King William, had drained\r\nEngland of its specie: its commerce began to droop for want of a proper\r\nmedium: its taxes were unproductive, and its revenues declined. The\r\nadministration wisely had recourse to the institution of a Bank; and\r\nit relieved the national difficulties. We are in the same, and still\r\ngreater, want of a sufficient medium. We have little specie: the paper\r\nwe have is of small value, and rapidly descending to less: we are\r\nimmersed in a war for our existence as a nation, for our liberty and\r\nhappiness as a people: we have no revenues nor no credit. A Bank, if\r\npracticable, is the only thing that can give us either the one or the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nBesides these great and cardinal motives to such an institution, and\r\nthe advantages we should enjoy from it, in common with other nations,\r\nour situation, relatively to Europe and to the West Indies, would give\r\nus some peculiar advantages.\r\n\r\nNothing is more common than for men to pass from the abuse of a good\r\nthing, to the disuse of it. Some persons, disgusted by the depreciation\r\nof the money, are chimerical enough to imagine it would be beneficial\r\nto abolish all paper credit, annihilate the whole of what is now in\r\ncirculation, and depend altogether upon our specie, both for commerce\r\nand finance. The scheme is altogether visionary, and in the attempt\r\nwould be fatal. We have not a competent stock of specie in this\r\ncountry, either to answer the purposes of circulation in trade, or to\r\nserve as a basis for revenue. The whole amount of what we have, I am\r\npersuaded, does not exceed six millions of dollars, one-fifth of the\r\ncirculating medium before the war. To suppose this would be sufficient\r\nfor the operations of commerce, would be to suppose that our domestic\r\nand foreign commerce were both reduced four-fifths: a supposition that\r\ncarries absurdity in the face of it. It follows that if our paper\r\nmoney were destroyed, a great part of the transactions of traffic\r\nmust be carried on by barter; a mode inconvenient, partial, confined,\r\ndestructive both of commerce and industry. With the addition of the\r\npaper we now have, this evil exists in too great a degree. With respect\r\nto revenue, could the whole of our specie be drawn into the public\r\ntreasury annually, we have seen that it would be little more than one\r\nhalf of our annual expense. But this would be impracticable; it has\r\nnever been effected in any country. Where the numerary of a country\r\nis a sufficient representative, there is only a certain proportion of\r\nit that can be drawn out of daily circulation; because, without the\r\nnecessary quantity of cash, a stagnation of business would ensue. How\r\nsmall, then, would be the proportion of the six millions (in itself so\r\nunequal a representative) which the public would be able to extract in\r\nrevenue. It must either have little or no revenue, or it must receive\r\nits dues in kind; on the inefficacy and inconveniences of which mode, I\r\nhave already remarked. The necessity for it, in part, unhappily now has\r\nplace, for the cause assigned, a deficiency of current cash: but were\r\nwe to establish it as our principal dependence, it would be impossible\r\nto contrive a mode less productive to the public, more contrary to the\r\nhabits and inclinations of the people, or more baneful to industry.\r\n\r\nBut waiving the objections on this head, there would still remain\r\na balance of four millions of dollars more than these States can\r\nfurnish in revenue, which must be provided for the yearly expense of\r\nthe war. How is this to be procured without a paper credit, to supply\r\nthe deficiency of specie, and enable the moneyed men to lend? This\r\nquestion, I apprehend, will be of no easy solution.\r\n\r\nIn the present system of things, the health of a State, particularly\r\na commercial one, depends on a due quantity and regular circulation\r\nof cash, as much as the health of an animal body depends upon the due\r\nquantity and regular circulation of the blood. There are indisputable\r\nindications that we have not a sufficient medium; and what we have is\r\nin continual fluctuation. The only cure to our public disorders, is to\r\nfix the value of the currency we now have, and increase it to a proper\r\nstandard, in a species that will have the requisite stability.\r\n\r\nThe error of those who would explode paper money altogether, originates\r\nin not making proper distinctions. Our paper was, in its nature, liable\r\nto depreciation, because it had no funds for its support, and was not\r\nupheld by private credit. The emissions under the resolution of March,\r\n’80, have partly the former advantage, but are destitute of the latter,\r\nwhich is equally essential. No paper credit can be substantial, or\r\ndurable, which has not funds, and which does not unite, immediately,\r\nthe interest and influence of the moneyed men, in its establishment and\r\npreservation. A credit begun on this basis, will, in process of time,\r\ngreatly exceed its funds: but this requires time, and a well settled\r\nopinion in its favor. ’Tis in a National Bank, alone, that we can find\r\nthe ingredients to constitute a wholesome, solid, and beneficial paper\r\ncredit.\r\n\r\nI am aware that, in the present temper of men’s minds, it will be no\r\neasy task to inspire a relish for a project of this kind: but much will\r\ndepend on the address and personal credit of the proposer. In your\r\nhands I should not despair: and I should have the greater hopes for\r\nwhat I am informed appeared to be the disposition, at the promulgation\r\nof the plan for a loan in Massachusetts. The men of property in\r\nAmerica, are enlightened about their own interest, and would easily\r\nbe brought to see the advantages of a good plan. They ought not to\r\nbe discouraged at what has happened heretofore, when they behold\r\nthe administration of our finances put into a better channel. The\r\nviolations of public engagements, hitherto, have proceeded more from a\r\nnecessity produced by ignorance and mismanagement, than from levity or\r\na disregard to the obligations of good faith.\r\n\r\nShould the success, in the first instance, not be as complete as\r\nthe extent of the plan requires, this should not hinder its being\r\nundertaken. It is of the nature of a Bank, wisely instituted, and\r\nwisely administered, to extend itself, and, from small beginnings, grow\r\nto a magnitude that could not have been foreseen.\r\n\r\nThe plan I propose, requires a stock of three millions of pounds,\r\nlawful money; but if one-half the sum could be obtained, I should\r\nentertain no doubt of its full success. It now remains to submit my\r\nplan, which I rather offer as an outline, than as a finished plan.\r\nIt contains, however, the general principles. To each article, in an\r\nopposite column, I shall affix an explanatory remark.\r\n\r\n Art I. A Bank to be              Remark 1. By the second Article,\r\n erected with a stock of three    a part of the stock is to be in landed\r\n millions of pounds, lawful       security: by this, the whole is to be\r\n money, at the rate of six        exempted from taxes. Here will be a\r\n shillings to a dollar, divided   considerable saving to the proprietor,\r\n into thirty thousand shares.     which is to be estimated among the clear\r\n This stock to be exempted        profits of the Bank. This will indeed\r\n from all public taxes and        be a small reduction of the public\r\n impositions whatsoever.          revenue; but the loss will be of little\r\n                                  consequence, compared with the advantages\r\n                                  to be derived from the Bank.\r\n\r\n Art II. A subscription           Remark 2. By admitting landed\r\n to be opened for the amount      security as a part of the Bank stock,\r\n of the stock.

A subscriber    employed for their benefit, but, on the\r\n of sixteen shares, and upwards,  credit of their landed security, by the\r\n to advance two-sixths in         seventh Article, may be raised an equal\r\n specie, one-sixth in bills or    amount in cash, to be also employed for\r\n securities on good European      their benefit: by which artifice they\r\n funds, and three-sixths in good  have the use of their land (exempted,\r\n landed security.

The present loss on their\r\n                                  bills is enormous. The Bank may engage\r\n                                  to receive them at a moderate discount,\r\n                                  and to supply on better terms than they\r\n                                  now make. Their business is at this time\r\n                                  trusted to a variety of hands, some\r\n                                  of which are neither very skilful nor\r\n                                  very honest: competitions, frauds, and\r\n                                  additional expense, are the consequences.\r\n\r\n                                  Congress could not hesitate on their\r\n                                  parts, as the amount of the contracts\r\n                                  would be a part of the loan required in\r\n                                  Article XIII.\r\n\r\n Art. XIII. The Bank              Remark 13. This loan will\r\n to lend Congress one million,    enable Congress to get through the\r\n two hundred thousand pounds,     expenses of the year.

It is of the greatest\r\n to become responsible for the    importance that the old currency should\r\n redemption of all the paper      be fixed at a certain value, or there\r\n now emitted; the old, at forty   will be danger of its infecting the\r\n for one in thirty years, the     future paper: besides, we want to raise\r\n new at par, with gold and        it to a point that will make it approach\r\n silver, according to the terms   nearer to an adequate medium. I have\r\n promised by Congress in their    chosen the resolution of March, ’80, as a\r\n resolution of March, ’80.        standard. We ought not, on any account,\r\n One-third of the first to be     to raise the value of the old paper\r\n redeemed at the end of every     higher than forty to one, for this will\r\n ten years; and the whole of      give it about the degree of value that\r\n the last to be redeemed at the   is most salutary; at the same time that\r\n expiration of the six years      it will avoid a second breach of faith,\r\n specified by Congress, with the  which would cause a violent death to\r\n interest of five per cent. The   all future credit. A stable currency is\r\n United States, in compensation   an idea fundamental to all practicable\r\n for this responsibility, to      schemes of finance. It is the duty and\r\n establish certain funds for an   interest of the public to give stability\r\n annuity, payable to the Bank,    to that which now exists; and it will be\r\n equal to the discharge of the    the interest of the Bank, which alone\r\n whole amount of the paper        can effect it, to co-operate. I have\r\n currency in thirty years, with   not mentioned the amount of the annuity\r\n an interest of two per cent.     to be paid by Congress, because I have\r\n per annum.                       not materials to judge what quantity\r\n                                  of paper money now exists; since it\r\n                                  will be necessary to take all the State\r\n                                  emissions into the calculation. I suppose\r\n                                  (including State emissions) there may be\r\n                                  about four hundred millions of dollars of\r\n                                  the old standard, and about four millions\r\n                                  of the new.[16] This will give us, in\r\n                                  specie-value, about fourteen millions\r\n                                  of dollars. This is what the Bank is\r\n                                  to become answerable for, and what the\r\n                                  public is to pay, by an annuity of thirty\r\n                                  years, with two per cent. interest. This\r\n                                  annuity would amount to six hundred\r\n                                  and eleven thousand, three hundred and\r\n                                  thirty-three, and one-third, dollars,\r\n                                  for which funds are to be provided. By\r\n                                  a rough calculation, I find that the\r\n                                  Bank would gain, in the thirty years,\r\n                                  about three millions of dollars, on the\r\n                                  simple footing of interest; and that it\r\n                                  will, at different periods, have more\r\n                                  public money in its possession, than it\r\n                                  will be in advance at others: so that,\r\n                                  upon the whole, the sum it will gain in\r\n                                  interest, will be for the loan of its\r\n                                  credit to the public, not of any specific\r\n                                  sum of cash. Besides, the interest of\r\n                                  the Bank may gain a very considerable\r\n                                  sum by the purchases it may make of the\r\n                                  old paper at its current value, before\r\n                                  the influence of this plan has time to\r\n                                  bring it back to the point at which it\r\n                                  is intended to be fixed.[17] It is the\r\n                                  obvious interest of the United States to\r\n                                  concur in this plan, because, by paying\r\n                                  three millions of dollars in interest\r\n                                  to the Bank, more than it would have\r\n                                  to pay to the money-holders, agreeably\r\n                                  to its present engagements, it would\r\n                                  avoid a new breach of faith, fix its\r\n                                  circulating medium increased in value\r\n                                  more than one-half, render the taxes more\r\n                                  productive, and introduce order into its\r\n                                  finances, without which our independence\r\n                                  is lost. It will also have only about\r\n                                  two-thirds of the funds to establish for\r\n                                  this plan that are required by the Act of\r\n                                  March, ’80, to discharge the new bills:\r\n                                  it will, of course, reserve a large\r\n                                  balance towards the current expenses,\r\n                                  which is no insignificant consideration.\r\n                                  Perhaps it may be imagined, that the same\r\n                                  funds established for the redemption\r\n                                  of the money in the same time, without\r\n                                  passing through the Bank, would have an\r\n                                  equal effect upon its credit, and then\r\n                                  we should save the interest of two per\r\n                                  cent. Experience proves the contrary. We\r\n                                  find the new notes depreciating in the\r\n                                  States which have provided good funds.\r\n                                  The truth is, there is not confidence\r\n                                  enough in any funds merely public. The\r\n                                  responsibility of the Bank would beget\r\n                                  a much stronger persuasion of the paper\r\n                                  being redeemed, and have incomparably\r\n                                  more efficacy in raising and confirming\r\n                                  its credit. Besides, the Bank might\r\n                                  immediately reduce the quantity by\r\n                                  purchase, which the public could not do.\r\n                                  It will be observed, that of the six\r\n                                  millions of dollars which constitute our\r\n                                  annual revenue, I require nine hundred\r\n                                  and seventy-nine thousand, three hundred\r\n                                  and thirty-three, and one-third, dollars,\r\n                                  in funds, to reimburse the loan for the\r\n                                  first year, and pay off the annuity for\r\n                                  the redemption of the old paper. It may\r\n                                  be asked, where these funds are to be\r\n                                  procured in the present impotence of\r\n                                  our federal government. I answer, there\r\n                                  are ample means for them, and they must\r\n                                  be had. Congress must deal plainly with\r\n                                  their constituents. They must tell them,\r\n                                  that power without revenue is a bubble;\r\n                                  that unless they give them substantial\r\n                                  resources of the latter, they will not\r\n                                  have enough of the former, either to\r\n                                  prosecute the war, or to maintain the\r\n                                  Union in peace; that, in short, they\r\n                                  must, in justice to the public and to\r\n                                  their own honor, renounce the vain\r\n                                  attempt of carrying on the war without\r\n                                  either; a perseverance in which, can only\r\n                                  deceive the people, and betray their\r\n                                  safety. They must demand an instant,\r\n                                  positive, and perpetual investiture of\r\n                                  an impost on trade; a land tax, and a\r\n                                  poll tax, to be collected by their own\r\n                                  agents. This Act to become a part of the\r\n                                  Confederation.\r\n\r\n                                  It has ever been my opinion that Congress\r\n                                  ought to have complete sovereignty in\r\n                                  all but the mere municipal law of each\r\n                                  State; and I wish to see a convention\r\n                                  of all the States, with full power to\r\n                                  alter and amend, finally and irrevocably,\r\n                                  the present futile and senseless\r\n                                  Confederation.\r\n\r\n                                  The taxes specified, may be made to\r\n                                  amount to three millions of dollars; the\r\n                                  other three millions to be raised by\r\n                                  requisition, as heretofore.\r\n\r\n Art. XV. The Bank                Remark 15. It is essential that\r\n notes to be received in payment  all taxes should be raised, throughout\r\n of all public customs and        the United States, in specie, or\r\n taxes, at an equivalent with     Bank notes at par, or the old paper\r\n gold and silver.                 at its current value at the time of\r\n                                  payment. This will serve to increase\r\n                                  the circulation and credit of the Bank\r\n                                  notes; but no person should be obliged to\r\n                                  receive them in private dealings. Their\r\n                                  credit must depend on opinion; and this\r\n                                  opinion would be injured by legislative\r\n                                  interposition.\r\n\r\n Art.

These Banks ought\r\n to be erected in Massachusetts,  to be in the interior of the country,\r\n Pennsylvania, and Virginia, to   remote from danger, with every precaution\r\n facilitate the circulation and   for their security in every way. Their\r\n payment of the Bank notes.       distance from the capital trading points,\r\n                                  will be an advantage, as it will make\r\n                                  applications for the payment of Bank\r\n                                  notes less convenient.\r\n\r\n Art. XX. The affairs             Remark 20. It is necessary, for\r\n of the Bank to be managed by     reciprocal security of the public, the\r\n twelve general Directors, men    proprietors, and the people, that the\r\n of reputation and fortune;       affairs of the Bank should be conducted\r\n eight of them to be chosen       under a joint direction.\r\n by the private proprietors,\r\n and four by Congress. The\r\n Minister of Finance to have the\r\n privilege of inspecting all\r\n their proceedings.\r\n\r\nThese, as has been already observed, are only intended as outlines;\r\nthe form of administration for the Bank, and all other matters, may\r\nbe easily determined, if the leading principles are once approved. We\r\nshall find good models in the different European Banks, which we can\r\naccommodate to our circumstances. Great care, in particular, should\r\nbe employed to guard against counterfeits; and I think methods may be\r\ndevised that would be effectual.\r\n\r\nI see nothing to prevent the practicability of a plan of this kind, but\r\na distrust of the final success of the war, which may make men afraid\r\nto risk any considerable part of their fortunes in the public funds;\r\nbut, without being an enthusiast, I will venture to assert, that, with\r\nsuch a resource as is here proposed, the loss of our independence is\r\nimpossible. All we have to fear is, that the want of money may disband\r\nthe army, or so perplex and enfeeble our operations, as to create in\r\nthe people a general disgust and alarm, which may make them clamor for\r\npeace on any terms. But if a judicious administration of our finances,\r\nassisted by a Bank, takes place, and the ancient security of property\r\nis restored, no convulsion is to be apprehended. Our opposition will\r\nsoon assume an aspect of system and vigor, that will relieve and\r\nencourage the people, and put an end to the hopes of the enemy. ’Tis\r\nevident they have it not in their power to subdue us by force of arms.\r\nIn all these States they have not more than fifteen thousand effective\r\ntroops, nor is it possible for them much to augment this number. The\r\nEast and West Indies demand reinforcements. In all the Islands, they\r\nhave not, at this time, above five thousand men; a force not more\r\nthan equal to the proper garrisoning of Jamaica alone; and which, the\r\nmoment they lose a maritime superiority in those seas, will leave them\r\nmuch cause to fear for their possessions. They will probably send out\r\nfifteen hundred or two thousand men, to recruit their regiments already\r\nhere; but this is the utmost they can do.\r\n\r\nOur allies have five thousand men at Rhode Island, which, in the worst\r\nevent that can happen, will be recruited to eight, to co-operate with\r\nus on a defensive plan. Should our army amount to no more than fifteen\r\nthousand men, the combined forces, though not equal to the expulsion of\r\nthe enemy, will be equal to the purpose of compelling them to renounce\r\ntheir offensive, and content themselves with maintaining one or two\r\ncapital points. This is on the supposition that the public have the\r\nmeans of putting their troops in activity. By stopping the progress\r\nof their conquests, and reducing them to an unmeaning and disgraceful\r\ndefensive, we destroy the national expectation of success, from which\r\nthe ministry draw their resources. It is not a vague conjecture, but\r\na fact founded on the best information, that, had it not been for the\r\ncapture of Charleston, and the victory of Camden, the ministry would\r\nhave been in the utmost embarrassment for the supplies of this year.\r\nOn the credit of those events, they procured a loan of five and twenty\r\nmillions. They are in a situation where a want of splendid successes\r\nis ruin. They have carried taxation nearly to its extreme boundary;\r\nthey have mortgaged all their funds; they have a large unfunded debt,\r\nbesides the enormous mass which is funded. This must necessarily create\r\napprehensions in their most sanguine partisans: and if these are not\r\ncounteracted by flattering events, from time to time, they cannot much\r\nlonger continue the delusion. Indeed, in this case, I suppose they must\r\nthemselves despair.\r\n\r\nThe game we play is a sure game, if we play it with skill. I have\r\ncalculated, in the preceding observations, on the most disadvantageous\r\nside. Many events may turn up, in the course of the summer, to make\r\neven the present campaign decisive.\r\n\r\nIf we compare the real ability of France, for revenue, with that of\r\nGreat Britain; the economy and sagacity in the conduct of the finances\r\nof the former; the extravagance and dissipation which are overwhelming\r\nthose of the latter; there will be found every reason to believe,\r\nthat the resources of France will outlast those of her adversary. Her\r\nfleet is not much inferior, independent of that of Spain and Holland.\r\nCombined with that of Spain, it is greatly superior. If the Dutch enter\r\ninto the war in earnest, and add their fleet, the superiority will be\r\nirresistible. Notwithstanding the injury they may sustain in the first\r\ninstance, the Dutch will be still formidable: they are rich in credit,\r\nand have extensive means for maritime power.\r\n\r\nExcept the Emperor, who is hostile, and the Dane, who is neutral,\r\nall the rest of Europe are either friends to France or to our\r\nindependence. Never did a nation unite more circumstances in its favor\r\nthan we do: we have nothing against us but our own misconduct.\r\n\r\nThere are two classes of men among us, equally mistaken: one who, in\r\nspite of daily experience, of accumulated distress, persist in a narrow\r\nline of policy, and, amidst the most threatening dangers, fancy every\r\nthing in perfect security. Another, who, judging too much from the\r\noutside, alarmed by partial misfortunes, and the disordered state of\r\nour finances, without estimating the real faculties of the parties,\r\ngive themselves up to an ignorant and ill-founded despondency. We want\r\nto learn to appreciate our true situation and that of the enemy. This\r\nwould preserve us from a stupid insensibility to danger on the one\r\nhand, and inspire us with a reasonable and enlightened confidence on\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nBut let us suppose the worst, that we shall, after all, fail in our\r\nindependence; our return to Great Britain, whenever it should happen,\r\nwould be by compact. The war would terminate by a mediation. It cannot\r\nbe supposed that the mediator would be so devoted to Great Britain,\r\nor would have so little consideration for France, as to oblige us to\r\nrevert to our former subjection by an unconditional surrender. While\r\nthey might confirm his dominion over us, they would endeavor to save\r\nappearances for the honor of France, and stipulate terms as favorable\r\nto us as would be compatible with a state of dependence. A general\r\namnesty, and the security of private property (of course the payment of\r\npublic debts), would be among the most simple and most indispensable.\r\nThis would comprehend the concerns of the Bank; and if, unfortunately\r\nfor our virtue, such a circumstance could operate as an inducement,\r\nit might be added, that our enemies would be glad to find, and to\r\nencourage such an institution among us for their own benefit.\r\n\r\nA question may arise concerning the abilities of these States to pay\r\ntheir debts after the establishment of their independence; and though\r\nany doubt on this head must originate in gross ignorance, it may be\r\nnecessary to oppose it with more than general argument, as has been\r\ndone heretofore. A very summary and obvious calculation will show that\r\nthere is nothing to be dreaded on this head.\r\n\r\nThe funds of nine hundred and seventy-nine thousand, three hundred and\r\nthirty-three, and one-third, dollars, proposed to be established for\r\npaying off the loan of the first year, and for redeeming the present\r\npaper, will, in thirty years, wipe off all the debts of the States,\r\nexcept those contracted to foreigners, which, I imagine, do not amount\r\nto four millions of dollars. Suppose we should be obliged, for two\r\nyears besides the present, to borrow an equal sum each year from the\r\nBank; the fund requisite to discharge these loans, on the same terms\r\nwith the first, will amount to seven hundred and thirty-six thousand\r\ndollars, to be deducted from the five million, and twenty thousand,\r\nsix hundred and sixty-six, and two-thirds, dollars, remaining on the\r\nannual revenue; which will reduce it to four millions, two hundred\r\nand eighty-four thousand, six hundred and sixty-six, and two-thirds,\r\ndollars: then the debt unfunded will be,\r\n\r\n To foreigners already contracted by supposition,         $4,000,000\r\n\r\n Deficiency of Revenue to the expense to be obtained on\r\n credit, the first year, besides the loan from the Bank,   1,479,333⅓\r\n\r\n Deficiency of Revenue for the second year deducting the\r\n fund for discharging the loan of this year,               1,847,333⅓\r\n\r\n Deficiency of Revenue for the third year, making the\r\n same deduction,                                           2,215,333⅓\r\n                                                         ----------\r\n                                                         $9,542,000\r\n\r\nShould, then, the war last three years longer, which must probably\r\nbe the utmost term of its duration, we shall find ourselves with an\r\nunfunded debt of nine million, five hundred and forty-two thousand\r\ndollars, and an unappropriated revenue of four million, two hundred\r\nand eighty-four thousand, six hundred and sixty-six, and two-thirds,\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nThe surplus of four millions, which is two hundred and eighty-four\r\nthousand, six hundred and sixty-six, and two-thirds, dollars, and the\r\nfunds appropriated to the payment of the other debts which will revert\r\nto the public at the end of thirty years, will be a sufficient fund\r\nfor the redemption of this debt in about thirty-five years: so that,\r\naccording to my plan, at the end of thirty-five years these States have\r\npaid off the whole debt contracted on account of the war; and, in the\r\nmean time, will have a clear revenue of four millions of dollars, for\r\ndefraying the expenses of their civil and military establishments.\r\n\r\nThis calculation supposes the ability of these States for revenue to\r\ncontinue the same as they now are, which is a supposition both false\r\nand unfavorable. Speaking within moderate bounds, our population will\r\nbe doubled in thirty years; there will be a confluence of emigrants\r\nfrom all parts of the world; our commerce will have a proportionable\r\nprogress; and of course our wealth and capacity for revenue. It will be\r\na matter of choice if we are not out of debt in twenty years, without\r\nat all encumbering the people.\r\n\r\nA national debt, if it is not excessive, will be to us a national\r\nblessing. It will be a powerful cement of our Union. It will also\r\ncreate a necessity for keeping up taxation to a degree which, without\r\nbeing oppressive, will be a spur to industry, remote as we are from\r\nEurope, and shall be from danger. It were otherwise to be feared our\r\npopular maxims would incline us to too great parsimony and indulgence.\r\nWe labor less now than any civilized nation of Europe; and a habit of\r\nlabor in the people, is as essential to the health and vigor of their\r\nminds and bodies, as it is conducive to the welfare of the State. We\r\nought not to suffer our self-love to deceive us in a comparison upon\r\nthese points.\r\n\r\nI have spun out this letter to a much greater length than I intended.\r\nTo develope the whole connection of my ideas on the subject, and\r\nplace my plan in the clearest light, I have indulged myself in many\r\nobservations which might have been omitted. I shall not longer intrude\r\nupon your patience than to assure you of the sincere sentiments of\r\nesteem with which I have the honor to be,\r\n\r\n                             Sir, your most obedient and humble servant,\r\n                             A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n[12] It is to be feared, too, that this sum is rated too high. Hitherto\r\nwe have not four hundred men from that State, nor very promising\r\naccounts of those which may be expected.\r\n\r\n[13] The proportion of the European armies, in general, to the national\r\npopulation, is calculated at one to a hundred. By this rule, supposing\r\nour population to be two and a half millions, our armies ought to\r\nconsist of twenty-five thousand men; but the proportion will naturally\r\nbe less in this country. Our population is more diffused; there is a\r\ngreater facility of procuring subsistence, fewer poor (and consequently\r\nfewer of that class of men whose habits, tempers, and circumstances\r\nlead them to embrace the military life) than in any other country in\r\nthe world. Hence it is, I say, twenty thousand men are as many as we\r\nshall be able to raise. Experience justifies this opinion. In the\r\nfirst paroxysms of enthusiasm our armies were larger. I believe, at\r\nparticular periods, we have had more than thirty thousand men in the\r\nfield: but our force has every year diminished, and has been for two\r\nyears past below the standard I have assigned. Immense efforts have\r\nbeen made to procure men, but they have not been able to produce more.\r\nThis shows that our military system is still susceptible of great\r\nreforms in favor of economy; but we dare not make them, because we\r\ncannot pay the army. I also said, twenty thousand men would be as many\r\nas we should stand in need of. The enemy have now less than this number\r\nwithin the States; and cannot, in the future progress of the war, have\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nAn equal force, with the occasional aid of the militia, will confine\r\nthem within one or two capital points; and this will be their defeat.\r\nBut we have a further resource in the troops of our allies. We must\r\nnot dream of decisive enterprises, unless our allies will assist us\r\nwith twelve or fifteen thousand land troops, and an undisputed maritime\r\nsuperiority. Then, with the aid of the militia, drawn out for a few\r\nmonths, we may undertake and succeed. Our true policy, in the meantime,\r\nis, to endeavor to form a solid compact force, proportioned to our\r\nnecessities.\r\n\r\n[14] The possibility of making up so large a proportion of specie\r\nwill depend on foreign assistance. It could hardly be hoped to effect\r\nit within ourselves, if, as I suppose, there are not more than six\r\nmillions of dollars in these States. It is true, plate is admitted;\r\nbut it is uncertain how far this may prove a resource. It were to be\r\nwished the proportion of specie might be as large as possible: but,\r\nperhaps, for fear of a failure, it may be advisable to alter the above\r\nproportions, so as to have, upon the whole, about one-third in specie,\r\nand two thirds in European funds and landed security.\r\n\r\n[15] It may, perhaps, not be impossible to make some profitable\r\nspeculations on the bullion which the Spaniards are afraid to transport\r\nfrom South America to Europe.\r\n\r\n[16] It is impossible too soon to make some arrangement that will\r\nenable Congress to put a stop to the further emission.\r\n\r\n[17] There is another immense consideration. The proprietors of the\r\nBank will be the holders of a great part of this paper. They have it in\r\ntheir power to double the value of it by this plan: which is, in other\r\nwords, to gain a hundred per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               De Peyster’s Point, May 2, 1781.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nI am extremely sorry to have embarrassed you by my late application,\r\nand that you should think there are insuperable obstacles to a\r\ncompliance with it. Having renounced my expectations, I have no other\r\ninducement for troubling your Excellency with a second letter, than to\r\nobviate the appearance of having desired a thing inconsistent with the\r\ngood of the service, while I was acquainted with the circumstances that\r\nmade it so.\r\n\r\nI was too interested a spectator of what happened in the case of\r\nMajor M’Pherson, not to have remarked, and not to recollect all the\r\ncircumstances. The opposition turned ostensibly on his being a brevet\r\nofficer, yet having a command in a corps formed entirely from one line:\r\nthe propriety of his being employed in a detachment from the army at\r\nlarge, so far as I remember, was not disputed. In delicacy to Major\r\nM’Pherson, no personal objections were formally made: but in reality\r\nthey existed, and contributed to the discontent. It was thought a\r\npeculiar hardship, that a gentleman who had, for a long time, fought\r\nagainst us, and had not taken part with us till a late period, and when\r\nour affairs had assumed a more prosperous aspect, should be preferred\r\nin one of the most honorary commands of the service. Your Excellency\r\nmust be convinced, that I mention this in no other view than to show\r\nthe sentiments of the officers at the time, and the whole grounds for\r\nthe opposition. My esteem for Major M’Pherson, and other reasons, make\r\nit impossible I can have a different intention.\r\n\r\nI know less of the motives of dissatisfaction in the case of Colonel\r\nGimat and Major Galvan; but I have understood that it is founded on\r\ntheir being appointed in the light corps for two successive campaigns.\r\n\r\nIt would be uncandid in me, not to acknowledge that I believe a\r\ndisposition to exclude brevet officers in general from command, has\r\na great share in the opposition in every instance; and that so far\r\nit affects my case. But, at the same time, it appears to me, this\r\nprinciple alone can never be productive of more than momentary murmurs,\r\nwhere it is not seconded by some plausible pretext. I also am convinced\r\nthat the Pennsylvania officers, for their own sakes, repented the\r\nrash steps they had taken; and, on cool reflection, were happy in an\r\nopportunity to relinquish their menaces of quitting a service to which\r\nthey were attached by habit, inclination, and interest, as well as by\r\npatriotism. I believe, too, we shall never have a similar instance\r\nin the army, unless the practice should be carried to excess. Major\r\nGalvan, I am told, will probably be relieved. Colonel Gimat will be\r\nthen the only brevet officer remaining in command. Your Excellency is\r\nthe best judge of the proper limits; and there can be no doubt, that\r\nthe rights of particular officers ought to give place to the general\r\ngood and tranquillity of the service.\r\n\r\nI cannot forbear repeating, that my case is peculiar, and dissimilar\r\nto all the former. It is distinguished by the circumstances I have\r\nbefore intimated; my early entrance into the service; my having made\r\nthe campaign of ’76, the most disagreeable of the war, at the head of\r\na company of artillery, and having been entitled, in that corps, to\r\na rank, equal in degree, more ancient in date, than I now possess;\r\nmy having made all the subsequent campaigns in the family of the\r\nCommander-in-Chief, in a constant course of important and laborious\r\nservice. These are my pretensions, at this advanced period of the war,\r\nto being employed in the only way which my situation admits; and I\r\nimagine they would have their weight in the minds of the officers in\r\ngeneral. I only urge them a second time, as reasons which will not\r\nsuffer me to view the matter in the same light with your Excellency, or\r\nto regard, as impracticable, my appointment in a light corps, should\r\nthere be one formed. I entreat they may be understood in this sense\r\nonly. I am incapable of wishing to obtain any object by importunity. I\r\nassure your Excellency, that I am too well persuaded of your candor,\r\nto attribute your refusal to any other cause than an apprehension of\r\ninconveniences that may attend the appointment.\r\n\r\n                           I have the honor to be, with perfect respect,\r\n                           Sir, your most obed’t servant,\r\n                           A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Washington. P. S. I have used the term brevet in the sense your\r\nExcellency appears to have understood it in, as signifying, in general,\r\nall officers not attached to any established corps. Congress seem,\r\nhowever, to have made a distinction: they only give a kind of warrant\r\nto those whom they designate as brevet officers. Mine is a regular\r\ncommission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLE VICOMTE DE NOAILLES A HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                         Newport, 10 May, 1781.\r\n\r\nJe suis certain, mon cher Colonel, de vous faire plaisir en vous\r\napprenant que votre ami Laurens est arrivé à Paris en bonne santé, après\r\nune traversée favorable. Au départ de la frégate La Concorde arrivée à\r\nBoston avec M. de Barras amiral, qui vient prendre le commandement de\r\nnotre flotte, et M. le Vicomte de Rochambau, Mr. Laurens avait déjà eu\r\nplusieurs conférences avec nos ministres; il aura été bien écouté et\r\nbien entendu de celui qui est chargé du departement de la marine, ainsi\r\nque de notre contrôleur général. Ces deux hommes paraissent influer\r\ninfiniment dans ce moment sur l’opinion du Roi de France et celle du\r\npeuple; qui finit en France, comme dans tous les pays du monde par\r\nêtre entendue. Vous saurez certainement quels sont les préparatifs\r\npour cette campagne; je désire que nous puissions délivrer l’Amérique\r\ndes souffrances qu’elle éprouve: quoique je ne sois point né dans un\r\npays libre mon cher Colonel, je verrai avec plaisir les fondemens que\r\nvous allez établir pour le bonheur et la tranquillité d’un peuple chez\r\nlequel toutes les nations de l’Europe auront les mêmes droits. Une fois\r\ncette époque arrivée, l’Humanité jettera avec plaisir ses yeux sur\r\nl’autre monde, et verra sans envie un peuple qui ne devra son bonheur\r\nqu’à son propre courage. S’il m’est possible de placer une petite\r\npierre dans ce vaste edifice, je me trouverai parfaitement heureux.\r\n\r\nLe Ministre chargé de gouverner les finances de notre puissance vient\r\nd’obtenir du roi de France la permission de lui rendre un compte\r\npublic de son administration depuis cinq ans qu’il en a la direction:\r\ncet exemple, le premier de ce genre a frappé l’Europe d’étonnement\r\net d’amiration pour la conduite de ce grand homme; il prouve qu’au\r\ncommencement de son ministère les dépenses de l’État excédait les\r\nrecettes de 24 millions. Les différentes économies qu’il a pu établir,\r\nmalgré la guerre et les frais énormes qu’elle exige, a rétabli non\r\nseulement l’équilibre mais même un bénéfice de dix millions de rente\r\nexcédante et dix sept millions cinq-cent mille livres, employé\r\nannuellement à des remboursements de rentes perpetuelles. Ce qui\r\nproduit maintenant 27 millions de rente de plus que de dépense. La\r\nmanière énergique, raisonnée et claire rend son ouvrage persuasif\r\naux yeux mêmes de ses ennemis. Je compte vous envoyer ce livre par la\r\npremière occasion et par celle-ci même, si l’homme qui vous remettra ma\r\nlettre veut s’en charger.\r\n\r\nJe vous demanderais pardon de mon importunité, mon cher Colonel, si je\r\nn’avais pas été assez heureux pour vous donner de nouvelles de notre\r\nami. Je vous prie de ne pas douter de l’extrême plaisir que j’aurai\r\ndans tous les temps de ma vie à vous prouver combien mon attachement\r\npour vous est tendre et sincère.\r\n\r\n                                        Le Vicomte de Noailles.\r\n\r\nJe vous prie de présenter mon respectueux hommage à Son Excellence\r\nle Général Washington; il force ses ennemis mêmes à l’estimer, et\r\nlorsqu’on l’a vu deux fois il laisse l’impression du respect le plus\r\ntendre.\r\n\r\nCol. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCARTER TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n                                         Newport, May 18, 1781.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. de Barras arrived a few days since, with the General’s son, in\r\na frigate from France. He has taken the command of the fleet. Seven\r\nhundred land forces are now embarking, the wind is fair, and they sail\r\nthis day to meet the convoy expected from France, with provisions and\r\nrecruits for the regiments here. I fear they will have a very trifling\r\naugmentation of force, and that this campaign will prove as inactive\r\nas the last. I imagine you will be with General Washington at the\r\nconference. You will have the pleasure to see General Chastellux,\r\nwho will give you this letter. At his return, I expect it will be\r\ndecided whether the army marches or not: at present it seems a matter\r\nof great doubt, notwithstanding the preparations which are making.\r\nI am astonished we hear nothing from the southward. I fear, if the\r\ndetachment, embarked at New-York, is destined for that quarter, that\r\nthe enemy will make a considerable progress.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                                Your friend and servant,\r\n                                                John Carter.\r\n\r\nColonel Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLA FAYETTE TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        Richmond, May 23, 1781.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Hamilton:\r\n\r\nI have been long complaining that I had nothing to do; and want of\r\nemployment was an objection I had to my going to the southward. But\r\nfor the present, my dear friend, my complaint is quite of an opposite\r\nnature; and I have so many arrangements to make, so many difficulties\r\nto combat, so many enemies to deal with, that I am just that much of\r\na general, as will make me a historian of misfortunes, and nail my\r\nname upon the ruins of what good folks are pleased to call the army in\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\nThere is an age past since I heard from you. I acknowledge that, on my\r\npart, I have not written so often as I ought to have done; but you will\r\nexcuse this silence in favor of my very embarrassing circumstances.\r\nHowever remote you may be from your former post of aid-de-camp to the\r\nCommander-in-Chief, I am sure you are nevertheless acquainted with\r\nevery transaction at head quarters. My letters have served to your\r\ninformation, and I shall consequently abstain from repetitions.\r\n\r\nOur forced march saved Richmond; Phillips was going down; and thus far\r\nI was very happy. Phillips’s return, his landing at Brandon, south side\r\nof James River, and the unmolested journey of Lord Cornwallis through\r\nNorth Carolina, made me apprehensive of the storm that was gathering.\r\nI advanced towards Petersburg, and intended to have established a\r\ncommunication upon James and Appamatox Rivers. Had Phillips marched to\r\nHalifax, I was determined to follow him; and should have risked every\r\nthing rather than to omit making a diversion in favor of Greene. But\r\nthat army took possession of Petersburg, and obliged me to stick to\r\nthis side of the river, from whence reinforcements are expected. Both\r\narmies have formed their junction, and must consist of between four and\r\nfive thousand men. We have nine hundred continentals. Their infantry\r\nis near five to one; their cavalry ten to one. Our militia are not\r\nnumerous, come without arms, and are not used to war. Government wants\r\nenergy; and there is nothing to enforce the laws. General Greene has\r\ndirected me to take command in this State; and I must tell, by the way,\r\nthat his letter is very polite and affectionate. It then became my duty\r\nto arrange the departments, which I found in the greatest confusion and\r\nrelaxation. Nothing can be obtained, and yet expenses were enormous.\r\n\r\nThe Baron, and the few new levies he could collect, are ordered to\r\nSouth Carolina. I am glad he goes, as the hatred of the Virginians to\r\nhim was truly hurtful to the service. Is it not strange that General\r\nWayne’s detachment cannot be heard of? They are to go to Carolina; but\r\nshould I want them for a few days, I am at liberty to keep them. This\r\npermission I will improve, so far as to receive one blow, that, being\r\nbeat, I may at least be beat with some decency. There are accounts that\r\nmake Lord Cornwallis very strong: others make him very weak. In this\r\ncountry there is no getting good intelligence.\r\n\r\nI request you will write me, if you approve of my conduct. The command\r\nof the waters, the superiority in cavalry, and the great disproportion\r\nof forces, gave the enemy such advantages, that I durst not venture\r\nout, and listen to my fondness for enterprise. To speak truth, I was\r\nafraid of myself as much as of the enemy. Independence has rendered me\r\nthe more cautious, as I know my own warmth. But if the Pennsylvanians\r\ncome, Lord Cornwallis shall pay something for his victory.\r\n\r\nI wish a reinforcement of _light infantry_, to recruit the battalions,\r\nor a detachment under General Huntington was sent to me. I wish Laurens\r\nor Sheldon were immediately dispatched with their horse.\r\n\r\nCome here, my dear friend, and command our artillery in Virginia. I\r\nwant your advice and your exertions. If you grant my request, you will\r\nvastly oblige,\r\n\r\n                                                    Your friend,\r\n                                                    La Fayette.\r\n\r\nColonel Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMORRIS TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    Philadelphia, May 26, 1781.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nIt is some time since I received your performance dated the 30th\r\nof April last. I have read it with that attention which it justly\r\ndeserves, and finding many points of it to coincide with my own\r\nopinions on the subject, it naturally strengthened that confidence\r\nwhich every man ought to possess, to a certain degree, in his own\r\njudgment. You will very soon see the plan of a Bank published, and\r\nsubscriptions opened for its establishment, having already met with the\r\napprobation of Congress. It only remains for individuals to do their\r\npart, and a foundation will be laid for the anticipation of taxes and\r\nfunds, by a paper credit that cannot depreciate.\r\n\r\nThe capital proposed falls far short of your idea, and, indeed, far\r\nshort of what it ought to be; but I am confident, if this is once\r\naccomplished, the capital may afterwards be increased to almost any\r\namount. To propose a large sum in the outset, and fail in the attempt\r\nto raise it, might prove fatal. To begin with what is clearly in our\r\npower to accomplish, and on that beginning, to establish the credit\r\nthat will inevitably command the future increase of capital, seems the\r\nmost certain road to success. I have thought much about interweaving\r\na landed security with the capital of this Bank, but am apprehensive\r\nit would convey to the public mind, an idea of paper being circulated\r\non that credit, and that the Bank, of consequence, must fail in its\r\npayments, in case of any considerable run on it: and we must expect\r\nthat its ruin will be attempted, by external and internal foes. I have\r\ntherefore left that point to the future deliberations of the Directors\r\nof this Bank, to whom, in due time, I shall communicate your address.\r\nI esteem myself much your debtor for this piece, not merely on account\r\nof the personal respect you have been pleased to express, but also on\r\naccount of your good intentions: and for these, and the pains you have\r\ntaken, I not only think, but on all proper occasions, shall say, the\r\npublic are also indebted to you.\r\n\r\nMy office is new, and I am young in the execution of it. Communications\r\nfrom men of genius and abilities will always be acceptable; and yours\r\nwill always command the attention of, Sir,\r\n\r\n                                          Your obedient, humble servant,\r\n                                          Robert Morris.\r\n\r\nColonel Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHUYLER TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                          Albany, May 30, 1781.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nYour favor, covering copies of the letters which passed between the\r\nGeneral and you, I received on Friday last at Saratoga, which I left,\r\nsomewhat indisposed, on Sunday, and arrived in the evening. The fatigue\r\nof the journey increased my disorder, which is the quinsy, with so\r\nmuch rapidity, that before Tuesday morning I was twice bled to prevent\r\nsuffocation. The inflammation is subsiding, and I have been able to\r\nswallow a little broth to-day. I propose to attend the Legislature the\r\nlatter end of the next week, when I shall have the pleasure of seeing\r\nyou at Fishkill on the Sunday following. I believe you may prepare\r\nyourself to go to Philadelphia, as there is little doubt but you will\r\nbe appointed.\r\n\r\nThe enemy are arrived at Crown Point: their number not perfectly\r\nascertained, but I believe about two thousand. It is said they intend\r\nto fortify there. A rumor prevails that the three companies of Van\r\nSchaik’s, now to the northward, are to be called down. If so, I shall\r\ninstantly remove my family and stock from Saratoga, being certain, if I\r\ndelay it more than four days after the troops move, that the enemy will\r\npossess themselves of the whole. Adieu.\r\n\r\n                                                  I am, dear Sir,\r\n                                                  Most affectionately\r\n                                                  And sincerely,\r\n                                                  Your obedient servant,\r\n                                                  Ph: Schuyler.\r\n\r\nColonel Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO MRS. HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Camp Near Dobbs’ Ferry, July 10, 1781.\r\n\r\nThe day before yesterday I arrived here, but for want of an opportunity\r\ncould not write any sooner; indeed, I know of none now. Finding when\r\nI came here, that nothing was said on the subject of a command, I\r\nwrote the General a letter, and inclosed him my commission. This\r\nmorning Tilghman came to me in his name, pressed me to retain my\r\ncommission, with an assurance that he would endeavor, by all means, to\r\ngive me a command, nearly such as I could have desired in the present\r\ncircumstances of the army. Though I know you would be happy to hear\r\nI had rejected this proposal, it is a pleasure my reputation would\r\nnot permit me to afford you. I consented to retain my commission, and\r\naccept the command. I quarter, at present, by a very polite and warm\r\ninvitation, with General Lincoln, and experience from the officers of\r\nboth armies every mark of esteem. * * *\r\n\r\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   Camp, August 7, 1781.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nThe other day I applied to Colonel Tilghman for an order for shoes,\r\nfor the two companies of levies. He thought, on a general principle,\r\nit could not be granted; but as from the best of my own recollection,\r\nconfirmed by inquiry of others, I have reason to believe a distinction\r\nwas made last campaign in favor of the advanced corps, in the case\r\nof Cortland’s regiment, I am induced to submit the matter to your\r\nExcellency.\r\n\r\nYour Excellency is sensible that the service of an advanced corps, must\r\nbe in general more active than of the line; and that, in a country\r\nlike this, the article of shoes is indispensable. If the men cannot be\r\nsupplied, they cannot perform the duty required of them; which will\r\nmake the service fall heavier upon that part of the corps which is not\r\nunder the same disability, as well as render a considerable part of\r\nit of much less utility. I will not add any personal consideration to\r\nthose which affect the service; though it certainly cannot be a matter\r\nof indifference to me.\r\n\r\nThe men, I am informed, have, in general, received a bounty of about\r\nthirty pounds each, which is spent. The State makes no provision\r\nfor them; and the fact is, they cannot supply themselves: they must\r\ntherefore be destitute if they have not a continental supply.\r\n\r\nThe distinction last campaign, was, if I am not mistaken, that shoes\r\nwere an article of absolute necessity, and therefore to be allowed,\r\nthough the articles of clothing were refused.\r\n\r\n                                            I have the honor to be,\r\n                                            Very respectfully,\r\n                                            Your Excellency’s\r\n                                            Most ob’t and humble serv’t,\r\n                                            A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nTo General Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO MRS. HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           August, 1781.\r\n\r\nIn my last letter I informed you that there was a greater prospect of\r\nactivity now, than there had been heretofore. I did this to prepare\r\nyour mind for an event which, I am sure, will give you pain. I begged\r\nyour father, at the same time, to intimate to you, by degrees, the\r\nprobability of its taking place. I used this method to prevent a\r\nsurprise, which might be too severe to you. A part of the army, my dear\r\ngirl, is going to Virginia, and I must, of necessity, be separated at a\r\nmuch greater distance from my beloved wife. I cannot announce the fatal\r\nnecessity, without feeling every thing that a fond husband can feel. I\r\nam unhappy; I am unhappy beyond expression. I am unhappy, because I am\r\nto be so remote from you; because I am to hear from you less frequently\r\nthan I am accustomed to do. I am miserable, because I know you will\r\nbe so; I am wretched at the idea of flying so far from you, without\r\na single hour’s interview, to tell you all my pains and all my love.\r\nBut I cannot ask permission to visit you. It might be thought improper\r\nto leave my corps at such a time, and upon such an occasion. I must\r\ngo without seeing you--I must go without embracing you;--alas! I must\r\ngo. But let no idea, other than of the distance we shall be asunder,\r\ndisquiet you. Though I said the prospects of activity will be greater,\r\nI said it to give your expectations a different turn, and prepare you\r\nfor something disagreeable. It is ten to one that our views will be\r\ndisappointed, by Cornwallis retiring to South Carolina by land. At all\r\nevents, our operations will be over by the latter end of October, and I\r\nwill fly to my home. Don’t mention I am going to Virginia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO MRS. HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Head of Elk, September 6, 1781.\r\n\r\nYesterday, my lovely wife, I wrote to you, inclosing you a letter in\r\none to your father, to the care of Mr. Morris. To-morrow the post sets\r\nout, and to-morrow we embark for Yorktown. I cannot refuse myself\r\nthe pleasure of writing you a few lines. Constantly uppermost in my\r\nthoughts and affections, I am happy only when my moments are devoted\r\nto some office that respects you. I would give the world to be able to\r\ntell you all I feel and all I wish, but consult your own heart and you\r\nwill know mine. What a world will soon be between us! To support the\r\nidea, all my fortitude is insufficient. What must be the case with you,\r\nwho have the most female of female hearts? I sink at the perspective of\r\nyour distress, and I look to heaven to be your guardian and supporter.\r\nCircumstances that have just come to my knowledge, assure me that our\r\noperations will be expeditious, as well as our success certain. Early\r\nin November, as I promised you, we shall certainly meet. Cheer yourself\r\nwith this idea, and with the assurance of never more being separated.\r\nEvery day confirms me in the intention of renouncing public life, and\r\ndevoting myself wholly to you. Let others waste their time and their\r\ntranquillity in a vain pursuit of power and glory; be it my object to\r\nbe happy in a quiet retreat with my better angel.\r\n\r\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHUYLER TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    Albany, September 16, 1781.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir:\r\n\r\nThe mail which was taken a few days ago at Hampton, has probably\r\ndeprived me of the pleasure of a line from you.\r\n\r\nWe are advised, by a letter from Mr. Carter, that General Washington\r\nembarked with all except the rear division of the French, at the head\r\nof Elk on the 8th inst.; hence I hope you are now operating against\r\nCornwallis. It is difficult to judge with precision of your prospects\r\nat this distance; but matters and appearances are so favorable, that\r\nthey justify a hope that the operations will be crowned with ample\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature of this State is to convene on the 1st of October, at\r\nPoughkeepsie: delegates are to be chosen: your friends will propose\r\nyou. If you should be appointed, you will have time to consider,\r\nwhether to accept or refuse will be most eligible. Should Cornwallis\r\nand his army fall into our hands, peace may, and probably will, be the\r\nconsequence. If so, I should most earnestly wish you in Congress: and\r\nif not, I should still prefer it to your remaining in the army, for\r\nreasons that are obvious.\r\n\r\n                                           I am, dear Sir,\r\n                                           Affectionately and sincerely,\r\n                                           Your obedient servant,\r\n                                           Ph: Schuyler.\r\n\r\nColonel Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO LA FAYETTE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Camp Before York Town, Oct. 15, 1781.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nI have the honor to render you an account of the corps under my\r\ncommand in your attack of last night upon the redoubt on the left\r\nof the enemy’s lines. Agreeably to your orders we advanced in two\r\ncolumns with unloaded arms: the right composed of Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nGimat’s battalion and my own, commanded by Major Fish; the left, of a\r\ndetachment commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Laurens, destined to take\r\nthe enemy in reverse, and intercept their retreat. The column on the\r\nright was preceded by a vanguard of twenty men, led by Lieutenant\r\nMansfield; and a detachment of sappers and miners, commanded by Captain\r\nGilliland, for the purpose of removing obstructions.\r\n\r\nThe redoubt was commanded by Major Campbell, with a detachment of\r\nBritish and German troops, and was completely in a state of defence.\r\n\r\nThe rapidity and immediate success of the assault are the best comment\r\non the behavior of the troops. Lieutenant-Colonel Laurens distinguished\r\nhimself by an exact and vigorous execution of his part of the plan, by\r\nentering the enemy’s work with his corps among the foremost, and making\r\nprisoner the commanding officer of the redoubt. Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nGimat’s battalion, which formed the van of the right-attack, and which\r\nfell under my immediate observation, encouraged by the decisive and\r\nanimated example of their leader, advanced with an ardor and resolution\r\nsuperior to every obstacle. They were well seconded by Major Fish\r\nwith the battalion under his command, who, when the front of the\r\ncolumn reached the abatis, unlocking his corps to the left, as he had\r\nbeen directed, advanced with such celerity as to arrive in time to\r\nparticipate in the assault.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Mansfield deserves particular commendation for the coolness,\r\nfirmness, and punctuality with which he conducted the vanguard.\r\nCaptain Olney, who commanded the first platoon of Gimat’s battalion,\r\nis entitled to peculiar applause. He led his platoon into the work\r\nwith exemplary intrepidity, and received two bayonet wounds. Captain\r\nGilliland, with the detachment of sappers and miners, acquitted\r\nthemselves in a manner that did them great honor.\r\n\r\nI do but justice to the several corps when I have the pleasure to\r\nassure you, there was not an officer nor soldier whose behavior, if\r\nit could be particularized, would not have a claim to the warmest\r\napprobation. As it would have been attended with delay and loss, to\r\nwait for the removal of the abatis and palisades, the ardor of the\r\ntroops was indulged in passing over them.\r\n\r\nThere was a happy coincidence of movements. The redoubt was in the same\r\nmoment enveloped and carried in every part. The enemy are entitled to\r\nthe acknowledgment of an honorable defence.\r\n\r\nPermit me to have the satisfaction of expressing our obligations to\r\nCol. Armand, Capt. Legongne, the Chevalier De Fontevieux and Capt.\r\nBedkin, officers of his corps, who, acting upon this occasion as\r\nvolunteers, proceeded at the head of the right column, and entering the\r\nredoubt among the first, by their gallant example contributed to the\r\nsuccess of the enterprise.\r\n\r\nOur killed and wounded you will perceive by the inclosed return. I\r\nsensibly felt, at a critical period, the loss of the assistance of\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Gimat, who received a musket ball in his foot, which\r\nobliged him to retire from the field. Captain Bets, of Laurens’s corps,\r\nCaptain Hunt and Lieutenant Mansfield, of Gimat’s, were wounded with\r\nthe bayonet in gallantly entering the work. Captain Kirkpatrick, of the\r\ncorps of sappers and miners, received a wound in the ditch.\r\n\r\nInclosed is a return of the prisoners. The killed and wounded of\r\nthe enemy did not exceed eight. Incapable of imitating examples of\r\nbarbarity, and forgetting recent provocations, the soldiery spared\r\nevery man who ceased to fight.\r\n\r\n                                 I have the honor to be,\r\n                                 With the warmest esteem and attachment,\r\n                                 Sir, your most ob’t and humble serv’t,\r\n                                 A. Hamilton,\r\n                                 Lieut. Col. Commanding.\r\n\r\n\r\nMajor-General the Marquis De La Fayette.\r\n\r\n Return of the killed and wounded in the advanced corps commanded by\r\n Lieutenant-Colonel Hamilton, in an attack on the enemy’s left redoubt,\r\n on the evening of the 14th of Oct., 1781.\r\n\r\nTable Key:\r\n K = Killed\r\n W = Wounded\r\n\r\n ===================++=======++=======++=======++========++=======++=======\r\n                    || Lieut.||       ||       ||  Sub-  || Ser-  || Rank &\r\n                    ||  Col. ||Majors.||Capt’s.||alterns.||geants.|| File.\r\n -------------------++---+---++---+---++---+---++---+----++---+---++---+---\r\n                    || K | W || K | W || K | W || K | W  || K | W || K | W\r\n -------------------++---+---++---+---++---+---++---+----++---+---++---+---\r\n Lt.

On this principle, though I do not think\r\nthe subject of the inclosed letter of sufficient importance to request\r\nan official communication of it, yet I should be happy it might in\r\nsome way be known to the members of that honorable body. Should they\r\nhereafter learn, that though retained on the list of their officers,\r\nI am not in the execution of the duties of my station, I wish them\r\nto be sensible, that it is not a diminution of zeal which induces me\r\nvoluntarily to withdraw my services, but that I only refrain from\r\nintruding them, when circumstances seem to have made them either not\r\nnecessary or not desired; and that I shall not receive emoluments\r\nwithout performing the conditions to which they were annexed. I also\r\nwish them to be apprised upon what footing my future continuance in\r\nthe army is placed; that they may judge how far it is expedient to\r\npermit it. I therefore take the liberty to request the favor of your\r\nExcellency to impart the knowledge of my situation in such manner as\r\nyou think most convenient.\r\n\r\n                                           I have the honor to be,\r\n                                           With perfect respect,\r\n                                           Your Excellency’s\r\n                                           Most ob’t and humble servant,\r\n                                           A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nGeneral Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   Philadelphia, March 1, 1782.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nYour Excellency will, I am persuaded, readily admit the force of this\r\nsentiment, that though it is the duty of a good citizen to devote his\r\nservices to the public, when it has occasion for them, he cannot, with\r\npropriety or delicacy to himself, obtrude them when it either has, or\r\nappears to have none. The difficulties I experienced last campaign in\r\nobtaining a command, will not suffer me to make any further application\r\non that head.\r\n\r\nAs I have many reasons to consider my being employed hereafter in a\r\nprecarious light, the bare possibility of rendering an equivalent will\r\nnot justify, to my scruples, the receiving any future emoluments from\r\nmy commission. I therefore renounce, from this time, all claim to\r\nthe compensations attached to my military station during the war, or\r\nafter it. But I have motives which will not permit me to resolve on\r\na total resignation. I sincerely hope a prosperous train of affairs\r\nmay continue to make it no inconvenience to decline the services of\r\npersons, whose zeal, in worse times, was found not altogether useless:\r\nbut as the most promising appearances are often reversed by unforeseen\r\ndisasters, and as unfortunate events may again make the same zeal\r\nof some value, I am unwilling to put it out of my power to renew my\r\nexertions in the common cause, in the line in which I have hitherto\r\nacted.\r\n\r\nI shall accordingly retain my rank while I am permitted to do it; and\r\ntake this opportunity to declare, that I shall be at all times ready\r\nto obey the call of the public, in any capacity, civil or military\r\n(consistent with what I owe to myself), in which there may be a\r\nprospect of my contributing to the final attainment of the object for\r\nwhich I embarked in the service.\r\n\r\n                                                 I have the honor to be,\r\n                                                 Very respectfully,\r\n                                                 Your Excellency’s\r\n                                                 Most obedient servant,\r\n                                                 A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nGeneral Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO MEADE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     Philadelphia, March, 1782.\r\n\r\nA half hour since brought me the pleasure of your letter of December\r\nlast. It went to Albany and came from thence to this place. I heartily\r\nfelicitate you on the birth of your daughter. I can well conceive your\r\nhappiness on that occasion, by that which I feel on a similar one.\r\nIndeed, the sensations of a tender father of the child of a beloved\r\nmother, can only be conceived by those who have experienced them.\r\n\r\nYour heart, my Meade, is peculiarly formed for enjoyments of this\r\nkind. You have every right to be a happy husband--a happy father. You\r\nhave every prospect of being so. I hope your felicity may never be\r\ninterrupted.\r\n\r\nYou cannot imagine how entirely domestic I am growing. I lose all taste\r\nfor the pursuits of ambition. I sigh for nothing but the company of\r\nmy wife and my baby. The ties of duty alone, or imagined duty, keep\r\nme from renouncing public life altogether. It is, however, probable\r\nI may not any longer be engaged in it. I have explained to you the\r\ndifficulties which I met with in obtaining a command last campaign. I\r\nthought it incompatible with the delicacy due to myself, to make any\r\napplication this campaign. I have expressed this sentiment in a letter\r\nto the General, and, retaining my rank only, have relinquished the\r\nemoluments of my commission, declaring myself, notwithstanding, ready\r\nat all times to obey the calls of the public. I don’t expect to hear\r\nany of these, unless the state of our affairs should change for the\r\nworse, and lest by any unforeseen accident that would happen, I choose\r\nto keep myself in a situation again to contribute my aid. This prevents\r\na total resignation.\r\n\r\nYou were right in supposing I neglected to prepare what I promised you\r\nat Philadelphia. The truth is, I was in such a hurry to get home that I\r\ncould think of nothing else. As I set out to-morrow morning for Albany,\r\nI cannot from this place, send you the matter you wish.\r\n\r\nImagine, my dear Meade, what pleasure it must give Eliza and myself\r\nto know that Mrs. Meade interests herself in us. Without a personal\r\nacquaintance, we have been long attached to her. My visit at Mr.\r\nFitzhugh’s confirmed my partiality. Betsy is so fond of your family,\r\nthat she proposes to form a match between her boy and your girl,\r\nprovided you will engage to make the latter as amiable as her mother.\r\n\r\nTruly, my dear Meade, I often regret that fortune has cast our\r\nresidence at such a distance from each other. It would be a serious\r\naddition to my happiness if we lived where I could see you every day;\r\nbut fate has determined it otherwise. I am a little hurried, and can\r\nonly request, in addition, that you will present me most affectionately\r\nto Mrs. Meade, and believe me to be,\r\n\r\n                                        With the warmest\r\n                                        And most unalterable friendship,\r\n                                        Yours,\r\n                                        A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLA FAYETTE TO HAMILTON.[18]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                         Paris, April 12, 1782.\r\n\r\nDear Hamilton:\r\n\r\nHowever silent you may please to be, I will nevertheless remind you of\r\na friend who loves you tenderly, and who, by his attachment, deserves\r\na great share in your affection. This letter, my dear sir, will be\r\ndelivered or sent by Count de Segur, an intimate friend of mine, a\r\nman of wit and of abilities, and whose society you will certainly be\r\npleased with. I warmly recommend him to you, and hope he will meet from\r\nyou with more than civilities. Now let us talk politics.\r\n\r\nThe old Ministry have retired, and Lord North was not sorry at the\r\nopportunity. The new ministers are not much our friends: they are not\r\nfriends to each other: they have some honest men with little sense, and\r\nsome sensible men without honesty. They are forced to new measures, not\r\nonly by circumstances, but also by the dispositions they have formerly\r\nannounced.\r\n\r\n_Entre nous seuls._ 81 [_the British Ministry_] gave a hint to 82\r\n[_the French Ministers_], but it would not do without 54 [_America_].\r\nNow the reverse will probably be done; after which, arrangements will\r\ntake place in a few months, and I wish you was here, not so much 205\r\n[_Secretary to Dr. Franklin_], as to the Commission. However, I would\r\nlike 205 to be 125 [_Minister to the French Court_]. If you are 153\r\n[_Member of Congress_], and if something is said to you there, I\r\nwish you may be employed in the answer. 5 [_French ships_] without 9\r\n[_Spanish ships_] (and 4 [_Dutch_] is nothing), will not, I fear, give\r\n40 [_Charleston._] That is a cause of delay, and the 7 [_Spaniards_]\r\nthink much more of 8 [West Indies]. But I hope for 26 [_Carolina_]\r\nand 22 [_Georgia_] in 18 [_September_]. 84 [_the King of France_] has\r\nanswered about 47 [_peace_], as you and I, and every good American,\r\nmay wish. In the present situation of affairs, I thought my presence\r\nwas more useful to the cause in this part of the world than it could\r\nbe on the other side of the Atlantic. I wish to have some matters well\r\narranged before I go, and then I hope to set sails towards my friends\r\nin America.\r\n\r\nBe pleased, my dear friend, to present my best respects to your lady.\r\nMy compliments wait on General Schuyler and all the family. Adieu, dear\r\nHamilton.\r\n\r\n                                     With the most sincere attachment,\r\n                                     I am, for ever,\r\n                                     Your devoted, affectionate servant,\r\n                                     La Fayette.\r\n\r\nColonel Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n[18] The _figures_ in the present letter are part of a cipher concerted\r\nbetween Hamilton and La Fayette. The interpretations, here placed\r\nbetween brackets, are written over the figures, on the originals, in\r\nGeneral Hamilton’s handwriting.--_Editor._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMORRIS TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Office of Finance, Philadelphia, May 2, 1782.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nMr. Charles Stewart, late Commissary General of Issue, has informed me\r\nyou are disposed to quit the military line for the purpose of entering\r\ninto civil life. He, at the same time, induced me to believe, that you\r\nwould accept the office of Receiver of the Continental taxes for the\r\nState of New-York. The intention of this letter is to offer you that\r\nappointment. The duties of the office will appear, in a great degree,\r\nfrom the publications made by me on this subject. In addition, it will\r\nbe necessary that you correspond frequently with me, and give accurate\r\naccounts of whatever may be passing in your State, which it may be\r\nnecessary for this office to be acquainted with. But this, and other\r\nthings of that sort, will be more fully communicated after you have\r\nsignified your acceptance of the office. For the trouble of executing\r\nit, I shall allow you one-fourth per cent. on the moneys you receive.\r\nThe amount of the quota called for from New-York, for the current\r\nyear, is, as you know, three hundred and seventy-three thousand,\r\nfive hundred and ninety-eight dollars. I shall be glad to know your\r\ndetermination as soon as possible. I make to you no professions of my\r\nconfidence and esteem, because I hope they are unnecessary; but if they\r\nare, my wish that you would accept the offer I make is the strongest\r\nevidence I can give of them.\r\n\r\n                                       I pray you, Sir, to believe me,\r\n                                       Very respectfully,\r\n                                       Your most ob’t and humble serv’t,\r\n                                       Robert Morris.\r\n\r\nColonel Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO MORRIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                          Albany, May 18, 1782.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nI had this day the honor of receiving your letter of the second\r\ninstant, and am much obliged by the mark of your confidence which it\r\ncontains; and to Colonel Stewart for his friendly intentions upon the\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nMy military situation has indeed become so negative that I have no\r\nmotive to continue in it; and if my services could be of importance\r\nto the public in a civil line, I should cheerfully obey its command.\r\nBut the plan which I have marked out to myself is the profession\r\nof the law; and I am now engaged in a course of studies for that\r\npurpose. Time is so precious to me, that I could not put myself in\r\nthe way of any interruptions, unless for an object of consequence to\r\nthe public or to myself. The present is not of this nature. Such are\r\nthe circumstances of this State, the benefit arising from the office\r\nyou propose would not, during the war, exceed yearly one hundred\r\npounds; for, unfortunately, I am persuaded it will not pay annually\r\ninto the Continental treasury above forty thousand pounds; and on a\r\npeace establishment this will not be for some time to come much more\r\nthan doubled. You will perceive, sir, that an engagement of this kind\r\ndoes not correspond with my views, and does not afford sufficient\r\ninducement to relinquish them. I am not the less sensible of the\r\nobliging motives which dictated the offer; and it will be an additional\r\none to that respect and esteem with which I have the honor to be, very\r\ntruly sir,\r\n\r\n                                     Your most obedient, humble servant,\r\n                                     A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nTo the Hon. Robert Morris, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMORRIS TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Office of Finance, June 4, 1782.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nI have received your favor of the eighteenth of May. I am much obliged\r\nby the friendly sentiments you express for me, which, be assured, I\r\nshall retain a grateful sense of. I see, with you, that the office I\r\nhad the pleasure of offering, will not be equal to what your abilities\r\nwill gain in the profession of the law; but I did intend that the whole\r\nsum should have been paid, although the whole quota of the taxes had\r\nnot been collected by the State: consequently the object is greater\r\nthan you supposed, and the business might probably be effected without\r\nmore attention than you could spare from your studies. If so, I should\r\nstill be happy in your acceptance; and will leave the matter open until\r\nI have an opportunity of hearing from you upon the subject.\r\n\r\n                                        I pray you to believe that I am,\r\n                                        With unfeigned esteem,\r\n                                        Your most obedient servant,\r\n                                        Robert Morris.\r\n\r\n\r\nColonel Alexander Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO MORRIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                         Albany, June 17, 1782.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nThe letter which you did me the honor to write me, of the fourth\r\ninstant, came to my hands too late to permit me to answer it by the\r\nreturn of the same post. The explanation you give of your intention\r\nin your late offer, makes it an object that will fully compensate for\r\nthe time it will deduct from my other occupations. In accepting it, I\r\nhave only one scruple, arising from a doubt whether the service I can\r\nrender, in the present state of things, will be an equivalent for the\r\ncompensation. The whole system (if it may be so called) of taxation\r\nin this State is radically vicious, burthensome to the people, and\r\nunproductive to Government. As the matter now stands, there seems to\r\nbe little for a Continental Receiver to do. The whole business appears\r\nto be thrown into the hands of the County Treasurers; nor do I find\r\nthere is any appropriation made of any part of the taxes collected,\r\nto Continental purposes, or any provision to authorize payment to the\r\nofficer you appoint: this, however, must be made. There is only one\r\nway in which I can imagine a prospect of being materially useful;\r\nthat is, in seconding your applications to the State. In popular\r\nassemblies much may sometimes be brought about by personal discussions,\r\nby entering into details, and combating objections as they rise. If\r\nit should, at any time, be thought advisable by you to empower me to\r\nact in this capacity, I shall be happy to do every thing that depends\r\non me to effectuate your views. I flatter myself, to you, sir, I need\r\nnot profess that I suggest this, not from a desire to augment the\r\nimportance of office, but to advance the public interest.\r\n\r\nIt is of primary moment to me, as soon as possible to take my station\r\nin the law; and on this consideration I am pressing to qualify myself\r\nfor admission the next term, which will be the latter end of July.\r\nAfter this, if you think an interview with me necessary, I will\r\nwait upon you in Philadelphia. In the mean time, I shall be happy\r\nto receive your instructions, and shall direct my attention more\r\nparticularly to acquiring whatever information may be useful to my\r\nfuture operations. I have read your publications at different times,\r\nbut as I have not the papers containing them in my possession, it\r\nwill be necessary that their contents should be comprised in your\r\ninstructions. A meeting of the Legislature is summoned early in the\r\nnext month, at which, if I previously receive your orders, it may be\r\npossible to put matters in train.\r\n\r\nI am truly indebted to you, sir, for the disposition you have\r\nmanifested upon this occasion; and I shall only add an assurance of my\r\nendeavors to justify your confidence, and prove to you the sincerity of\r\nthat respectful attachment with which\r\n\r\n                                             I am, Sir,\r\n                                             Your most obedient servant,\r\n                                             A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nTo Robert Morris, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO COMFORT SANDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                         Albany, June 22, 1782.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nMr. Morris having lately offered me the appointment of Receiver of\r\nContinental taxes for this State, I wish to collect as much and\r\nas accurate information as possible of the situation of its money\r\nconcerns. It will be, among other things, of great importance that I\r\nshould form an idea of the money brought into the State and carried\r\nout of it; and, with a view to this, I take the liberty to request you\r\nwill furnish me with an estimate of what you have reason to think you\r\nwill lay out in this State in the course of a year, in the transactions\r\nof your contract business. Mr. Duer has been so obliging as to promise\r\nme a sketch of his disbursements in this quarter, and has informed me\r\nthat you are principally charged with what relates to the supplies of\r\nthe main army as well as West Point; and will therefore be best able\r\nto enlighten me on that head. The calculation may not admit of absolute\r\nprecision; but if it comes near the truth it will answer. It would be\r\nuseful that you could distinguish, as nearly as possible, what part\r\nwill be in specie, what in bank and in other notes. As this is a matter\r\nthat can be attended with no inconvenience to any person, and will be\r\nconducive to the public utility, I flatter myself you will favor me\r\nwith a speedy communication.\r\n\r\n                                             I am, with esteem, Sir,\r\n                                             Your most obedient servant,\r\n                                             A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nTo Comfort Sands, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLA FAYETTE TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                          Paris, June 29, 1782.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Hamilton:\r\n\r\nHow it happens that I still am in Paris, I hardly can myself conceive;\r\nand what is more surprising, there are two frigates going, neither\r\nof which will carry your friend to America. Don’t think, however,\r\ndear Hamilton, I am so much altered as to be kept here by pleasure\r\nor private affairs. But in the present circumstances, the American\r\nministers have insisted upon my remaining some time longer at this\r\ncourt; where, they say, I may render myself more useful to our cause,\r\nthan I can possibly be in America, during an inactive campaign. My\r\nreturn, however, is only deferred for a few weeks; and after some\r\nanswers have arrived from England, which, I think, will discover the\r\nviews of, but not yet produce a reconciliation with, Great Britain, I\r\nintend embarking for Philadelphia, where I hope to land in the first\r\ndays of September.\r\n\r\nThis stroke of Count de Grasse has greatly deranged my schemes. I hoped\r\nfor 40 [_Charleston_] and perhaps for better than that; but nothing\r\nuntil 6 [_Jamaica_] was done. 40 [_Charleston_] I much expected. 9\r\n[_the Spaniards_] don’t like 54 [_America_]. We must previously have\r\n40 [_Charleston_]; and then, to put them in good humor, do something\r\nabout 8 [_West Indies_]; both of which are not yet done; and after\r\nthat I hope. But at all events, this campaign will be very inactive, I\r\nthink. However, they are going to take Gibraltar, and will gather so\r\nmany means of doing of it, that it is said they will succeed. After\r\nthis trial, the forces of the House of Bourbon will be distributed\r\nwith a better scale. 46 [_Negotiations_] is going on, and 47 [_Peace_]\r\nexpected; but not, I think, immediately. You have a good chance, and\r\nI believe you have time, to be one of the 125 [_Commissioners_].\r\nJefferson does not come. Mr. Laurens, I am told, intends to return\r\nhome; and I cannot conceive (_entre nous_) what he is about. Mr. Adams\r\nthinks his presence is wanting in Holland. I thought I had better give\r\nyou these intelligences.\r\n\r\nNot a word from you since we parted in Virginia; but I am a\r\ngood-natured man, and will not get tired to speak to a deaf man. Adieu.\r\n\r\n                                           Most affectionately,\r\n                                           Your for ever devoted friend,\r\n                                           La Fayette.\r\n\r\n  To Lieutenant-Colonel\r\n  Alexander Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMORRIS TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Office of Finance, July 2, 1782.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nI yesterday received your letter of the seventeenth of June, and am\r\nvery happy to find you determined to accept the office I had the\r\npleasure of offering to you. I inclose the Commission, Instructions,\r\netc., together with a Bond for performance of the duties, which I must\r\nrequest you to fill up, execute with some sufficient security, and\r\ntransmit.\r\n\r\nThe complaint you make of the system of taxation in New-York, might, I\r\nbelieve, very justly be extended; for, though it may be more defective\r\nin some than in others, it is, I fear, very far from perfect in any.\r\nI had already heard that no part of the taxes were appropriated to\r\nContinental purposes; but I expect that the Legislature will, when\r\nthey meet, make such appropriation, as well as lay new, and, I hope,\r\nproductive taxes, for the purposes of paying what may remain of their\r\nquota. It gives me a singular pleasure to find, that you have yourself\r\npointed out one of the principal objects of your appointment. You will\r\nfind that it is specified in the inclosure of the fifteenth of April.\r\nI do not conceive that any interview will be necessary, though I shall\r\nalways be happy to see you, when your leisure and convenience will\r\nadmit. In the mean time, I must request you to exert your talents in\r\nforwarding with your Legislature, the views of Congress. Your former\r\nsituation in the army, the present situation of that very army, your\r\nconnections in the State, your perfect knowledge of men and measures,\r\nand the abilities which heaven has blessed you with, will give you\r\na fine opportunity to forward the public service, by convincing the\r\nLegislature of the necessity of copious supplies, and by convincing all\r\nwho have claims on the justice of Congress, that those claims exist\r\nonly by that hard necessity which arises from the negligence of the\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nWhen to this, you shall superadd the conviction that what remains of\r\nthe war, being only a war of finance, solid arrangements of finance\r\nmust necessarily terminate favorably, not only to our hopes, but even\r\nto our wishes; then, sir, the Governments will be disposed to lay, and\r\nthe people to bear, those burthens which are necessary; and then the\r\nutility of your office, and of the officer, will be as manifest to\r\nothers as at present to me.\r\n\r\n                                                 With perfect respect,\r\n                                                 Your most obedient\r\n                                                 And humble servant,\r\n                                                 Robert Morris.\r\n\r\n  Alexander Hamilton, Esq.,\r\n  Receiver of Taxes for New-York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO MORRIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                         Albany, July 13, 1782.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nI have this moment received your letter of the second inst., and as the\r\npost will set out on its return in half an hour, I have little more\r\nthan time to acknowledge the receipt of it.\r\n\r\nI shall, to-morrow morning, commence a journey to Poughkeepsie, where\r\nthe Legislature are assembled; and I will endeavor, by every step in\r\nmy power, to second your views; though, I am sorry to add, without\r\nvery sanguine expectations. I think it probable the Legislature will\r\ndo something: but whatever momentary effort they may make, till the\r\nentire change of their present system, very little will be done. To\r\neffect this, mountains of prejudice and particular interest are to be\r\nlevelled. For my own part, considering the late serious misfortune\r\nof our ally, the spirit of reformation, of wisdom, and of unanimity,\r\nwhich seems to have succeeded to that of blunder, perverseness, and\r\ndissension in the British Government, and the universal reluctance of\r\nthese States to do what is right, I cannot help viewing our situation\r\nas critical: and I feel it the duty of every citizen to exert his\r\nfaculties to the utmost to support the measures, especially those solid\r\narrangements of finance on which our safety depends.\r\n\r\nI will, by next post, forward you the Bond executed with proper\r\nsureties.\r\n\r\nIt is not in the spirit of compliment, but of sincerity, I assure you,\r\nthat the opinion I entertain of him who presides in the department,\r\nwas not one of the smallest motives to my acceptance of the office;\r\nnor will that esteem and confidence which make me now sensibly feel\r\nthe obliging expressions of your letter, fail to have a great share in\r\ninfluencing my future exertions.\r\n\r\n                                        I have the honor to be,\r\n                                        With perfect esteem and respect,\r\n                                        Your obedient servant,\r\n                                        A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Robert Morris, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO GOV. CLINTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   Poughkeepsie, July 16, 1782.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nI have the honor to inclose your Excellency the copy of a warrant from\r\nthe Honorable Robert Morris, Esq., Superintendent of the Finances of\r\nthe United States; by which you will perceive that, agreeably to the\r\nResolution of Congress of the second of November last, he has appointed\r\nme Receiver of the Continental taxes for this State. I am therefore\r\nto request that the Legislature will be pleased to vest in me the\r\nauthority required by that Resolution.\r\n\r\nIt is a part of my duty to explain to the Legislature, from time to\r\ntime, the views of the Superintendent of Finance, in pursuance of the\r\norders of Congress, that they may be the better enabled to judge of the\r\nmeasures most proper to be adopted for an effectual co-operation. For\r\nthis purpose, I pray your Excellency to impart my request, that I may\r\nhave the honor of a conference with a Committee of the two Houses, at\r\nsuch time and place as they may find convenient.\r\n\r\n                                        I have the honor to be,\r\n                                        With perfect respect and esteem,\r\n                                        Your Excellency’s\r\n                                        Most obedient servant,\r\n                                        A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nTo his Excellency Governor Clinton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO MORRIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    Poughkeepsie, May 22, 1782.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nAgreeably to my letter to you from Albany, I came to this place, and\r\nhad an interview with a Committee of the Legislature, in which I\r\nurged the several matters contained in your instructions. I strongly\r\nrepresented the necessity of solid arrangements of finance; and, by\r\nway of argument, pointed out all the defects of the present system. I\r\nfound every man convinced that something was wrong, but few that were\r\nwilling to recognize the mischief when defined, and consent to the\r\nproper remedy. The quantum of taxes already imposed is so great as to\r\nmake it useless to impose any others to a considerable amount. A bill\r\nhas, however, passed both Houses, payable in specie, bank notes, or\r\nyour notes, for eighteen thousand pounds. It is at present appropriated\r\nto your order; but I doubt whether some subsequent arrangement will not\r\ntake place for a different appropriation. The Commander-in-Chief has\r\napplied for a quantity of forage, which the Legislature is devising\r\nthe means of furnishing; and I fear it will finish by diverting the\r\neighteen thousand pounds to that purpose. I have hitherto been able to\r\nprevent this; but as it is of indispensable importance to me to leave\r\nthis place immediately, to prepare for my examination, for which I have\r\npledged myself the ensuing term, which is at hand, it is possible,\r\nafter I have left it, contrary ideas will prevail. Efforts have been\r\nmade to introduce a species of negotiable certificates, which I have\r\nstrenuously opposed. It has not yet taken place; but I am not clear how\r\nthe matter will terminate.\r\n\r\nShould the bill for the eighteen thousand pounds go out in its present\r\nform, I cannot hope that it will produce in the treasury above half the\r\nsum; such are the vices of our present mode of collection.\r\n\r\nA bill has also passed the Assembly for collecting arrearages of taxes,\r\npayable in specie, bank notes, your notes; old Continental emissions\r\nat one hundred and twenty-eight for one, and a species of certificates\r\nissued by the State for the purchase of horses. This is now before the\r\nSenate. The arrearages are very large.\r\n\r\nBoth Houses have unanimously passed a set of resolutions, to be\r\ntransmitted to Congress and the several States, proposing a Convention\r\nof the States, to enlarge the powers of Congress and vest them with\r\nfunds. I think this a very eligible step, though I doubt of the\r\nconcurrence of the other States; but I am certain, without it, they\r\nnever will be brought to co-operate in any reasonable or effectual\r\nplan. Urge reforms, or exertions, and the answer constantly is, What\r\navails it for one State to make them without the concert of the others?\r\nIt is in vain to expose the futility of this reasoning: it is founded\r\nin all those passions which have the strongest influence on the human\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature have also appointed, at my instance, a committee to\r\ndevise, in its recess, a more effectual system of taxation, and to\r\ncommunicate with me on this subject. A good deal will depend on the\r\nsuccess of this attempt. Convinced of the absurdity of multiplying\r\ntaxes in the present mode, where, in effect, the payment is voluntary,\r\nand the money received exhausted in the collection, I have labored\r\nchiefly to instil the necessity of a change in the plan; and, though\r\nnot so rapidly as the exigency of public affairs requires, truth seems\r\nto be making some progress.\r\n\r\nThere is no other appropriation to the use of Congress than of the\r\neighteen thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nI shall, as soon as possible, give you a full and just view of the\r\nsituation and temper of this State. This cannot be till after my\r\nintended examination: that over, I shall lay myself out in every way\r\nthat can promote your views and the public good.\r\n\r\nI am informed you have an appointment to make of a Commissioner of\r\nAccounts for this State. Permit me to suggest the expediency of\r\nchoosing a citizen of the State; a man who, to the qualifications\r\nrequisite for the execution of the office, adds an influence in its\r\naffairs. I need not particularize the reasons of this suggestion. In my\r\nnext I will also take the liberty to mention some characters.\r\n\r\nI omitted mentioning that the two Houses have also passed a bill,\r\nauthorizing Congress to adjust the quotas of the States on equitable\r\nprinciples, agreeably to your recommendation.\r\n\r\n                                    I have the honor to be,\r\n                                    With sincere attachment and respect,\r\n                                    Sir, your most obedient servant,\r\n                                    A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the Hon. Robert Morris, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO COLONEL HAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        Albany, August 3, 1782.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nMr. Morris, some time since, in a circular letter to the States,\r\namong other things, requested to have an account of all the money,\r\nprovisions, transportations, etc., furnished by this State to the\r\nUnited States, since the eighteenth of March, seventeen hundred and\r\neighty.\r\n\r\nI have been very happy to hear, that this business has been intrusted\r\nto your hands: for I am sure, feeling its importance, you will give it\r\nall the dispatch in your power.\r\n\r\nI have written to the Governor on the subject; but, lest other\r\noccupations should delay his attention to it, I must request you to\r\ninform me, precisely, what part of the matter has been intrusted to\r\nyour management, and what progress you have been able to make.\r\n\r\nI shall also thank you to send me the amount of any certificates, or\r\npaper money in any shape, which, through your office, have passed into\r\ncirculation, distinguishing the different species.\r\n\r\nYou will do me a favor by letting me hear from you as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n                                              I am, with sincere esteem,\r\n                                              Your obedient servant,\r\n                                              A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nP. S. I must still trouble you with an additional request, which is,\r\nthat you let me know, as exactly as possible, the gross product of each\r\nsupply-bill in your department in specie value, and the amount of all\r\nexpenses on each. This I want, with a view to the subjects we have been\r\nspeaking of.\r\n\r\n                                                                   A. H.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO GOVERNOR CLINTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        Albany, August 8, 1782.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nI have lately received a letter from the Superintendent of Finance,\r\ninclosing a copy of a circular letter from him to the several States,\r\ndated twenty-fifth July, ’81, in which he requests information on the\r\nfollowing important points.\r\n\r\n“What supplies, of every kind, money, provisions, forage,\r\ntransportation, etc., have been furnished by this State to the United\r\nStates, since the eighteenth of March, 1780.”\r\n\r\n“The amount of the money in the treasury: the sums expected to be\r\nthere; the times they will probably be brought in; the appropriations.”\r\n\r\n“The amount of the different paper currencies in the State; the\r\nprobable increase, or decrease, of each; and the respective rates of\r\ndepreciation.”\r\n\r\n“The Acts passed since the eighteenth of March, 1780, for raising\r\ntaxes, furnishing supplies, etc.; the manner they have been executed;\r\nthe time necessary for them to operate; the consequences of their\r\noperation; the policy of the State relative to laying, assessing,\r\nlevying, and collecting taxes.”\r\n\r\nIn his letter, which is _circular_, to the Receivers, he says the\r\nanswers he has received to these inquiries are few and short of the\r\nobject; and he therefore urges me to take the most speedy and effectual\r\nmeans, in my power, to enable him to form a proper judgment on such\r\nof the subjects referred to, as the actual state of things renders it\r\nimportant to know.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with this, I request the favor of your Excellency to\r\ninform me, what steps have been taken on the several heads of which the\r\nabove is an abstract: and what progress has been made in the business;\r\nparticularly with respect to the first article. I shall also be much\r\nobliged to you to direct Mr. Holt to furnish me, without delay, with\r\nthe Acts mentioned in the inclosed list.\r\n\r\nYour Excellency must have been too sensible of the necessity of\r\nenabling the Director of the Finances of the United States to form a\r\njust judgment of the true state of our affairs, to have omitted any\r\nmeasure in your power to procure the fullest information on the several\r\nmatters submitted to you: and I am persuaded the business is in such a\r\ntrain that little will be left for me to do.\r\n\r\nI entreat you will do me the honor to let me hear from you as soon as\r\npossible on the subject.\r\n\r\nIt would promote the public business, if you would be so good as to\r\ndirect Mr. Banker to supply me with such information as I might call\r\nupon him for. He is very obliging, but without some authority for the\r\npurpose, there is a delicacy in calling upon him. I wrote at the same\r\ntime to Mr. Holt, printer for the State, desiring him to forward me\r\nthe copies of the Acts above mentioned; and telling him, that if the\r\nGovernor did not make satisfaction, I would do it. These Acts were all\r\nthose relative to finance and supply, from March eighteenth, 1780, to\r\nthis time.\r\n\r\n                                                  With perfect respect,\r\n                                                  I am your Excellency’s\r\n                                                  Most obedient servant,\r\n                                                  A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nTo His Excellency Governor Clinton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO THE COUNTY TREASURERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      Albany, August 5th, 1782.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nIt will be of great utility to the State, and essential to the\r\nexecution of my instructions from the Superintendent of Finance, that\r\nI should be able to ascertain, as speedily as possible, the expense\r\nattending the collection of taxes within this State. In order to this,\r\nI shall be much obliged to you to send me without delay an account of\r\nwhat you have received in your county, since the beginning of the\r\nyear ’80 to this time, as well for the taxes laid for county purposes,\r\nas for those imposed by the Legislature; and of the expenses of every\r\nkind attending the collection; those of the supervisors, assessors, the\r\nallowance to the collectors and to yourself.\r\n\r\nWhen I assure you I want this information for an important purpose, I\r\ndoubt not you will forward it to me as speedily as it can be prepared,\r\nand with as much accuracy as circumstances will permit; by doing which,\r\nyou will serve the public and oblige, Sir,\r\n\r\n                                Your most obedient servant,\r\n                                A. Hamilton,\r\n                                Receiver of C. S. for the State of N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO MORRIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                        August 13, 1782.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nThe speculation of evils, from the claims of Great Britain, gives\r\nway to the pressure of inconveniences actually suffered; and we\r\nrequired the event which has lately happened, the recognition of our\r\nindependence by the Dutch, to give a new spring to the public hopes and\r\nthe public passions. This has had a good effect. And if the Legislature\r\ncan be brought to adopt a wise plan for its finances, we may put the\r\npeople in better humor, and give a more regular and durable movement to\r\nthe machine. The people of this State, as far as my observation goes,\r\nhave as much firmness in their make, and as much submissiveness to\r\nGovernment, as those of any part of the Union.\r\n\r\nIt remains for me to give you an explicit opinion of what it is\r\npracticable for this State to do. Even with a judicious plan of\r\ntaxation, I do not think the State can afford, or the people will bear\r\nto pay, more than seventy or eighty thousand pounds a year. In its\r\nentire and flourishing state, according to my mode of calculating,\r\nit could not have exceeded two hundred and thirty or forty thousand\r\npounds; and, reduced as it is, with the wheels of circulation so\r\nexceedingly clogged for want of commerce and a sufficient medium,\r\nmore than I have said cannot be expected. Passed experience will not\r\nauthorize a more flattering conclusion.\r\n\r\nOut of this is to be deducted the expense of the interior\r\nadministration of Government, and the money necessary for the levies\r\nof men. The first amounts to about twelve thousand pounds, as you will\r\nperceive by the inclosed statement; but I suppose the Legislature\r\nwould choose to retain fifteen thousand pounds. The money hitherto\r\nyearly expended in recruits, has amounted to between twenty and\r\nthirty thousand pounds; but, on a proper plan, ten thousand pounds\r\nmight suffice. There would then remain forty thousand pounds for your\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\nBut this is on the supposition of a change of system; for, with the\r\npresent, I doubt there being paid into the Continental treasury\r\none-third the sum.\r\n\r\nI am endeavoring to collect materials for greater certainty upon this\r\nsubject; but the business of supplies has been so diversified, lodged\r\nin such a variety of independent hands, and so carelessly transacted,\r\nthat it is hardly possible to get any tolerable idea of the gross\r\nand net product. With the help of these materials I shall strive to\r\nconvince the committee, when they meet, that a change of measures is\r\nessential. If they enter cordially into right views, we may succeed:\r\nbut I confess I fear more than I hope.\r\n\r\nI have taken every step in my power to procure the information you have\r\ndesired in your letter of July ’81; the most material part of it, an\r\naccount of the supplies furnished since March seventeen hundred and\r\neighty, has been committed to Colonel Hay. I have written to him, in\r\npressing terms, to accelerate the preparation.\r\n\r\nYou will perceive, sir, I have neither flattered the State, nor\r\nencouraged high expectations. I thought it my duty to exhibit things as\r\nthey are, not as they ought to be. I shall be sorry if it give an ill\r\nopinion of the State, for want of equal candor in the representation\r\nof others; for, however disagreeable the reflection, I have too much\r\nreason to believe, that the true picture of other States would be,\r\nin proportion to their circumstances, equally unpromising. All my\r\ninquiries, and all that appears, induces this opinion. I intend this\r\nletter _in confidence_ to yourself, and therefore I endorse it private.\r\n\r\nBefore I conclude, I will say a word on a point that possibly you\r\nwould wish to be informed about. The contract up this way is executed\r\ngenerously to the satisfaction of officers and soldiers; which is the\r\nmore meritorious in the contractor, as, in all probability, it will be\r\nto him a losing undertaking.\r\n\r\n                                  I have the honor to be,\r\n                                  With sentiments of unfeigned respect,\r\n                                  Sir, your most ob’t and humble serv’t,\r\n                                  A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nTo the Hon. Robert Morris, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR CLINTON TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Poughkeepsie, August 18, 1782.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nI have received your letter of the third instant. I am not authorized\r\nto direct the printer to deliver any of the laws, except a certain\r\nnumber of sets which are by law directed for particular purposes. I\r\nhave, however, mentioned your desire to the gentlemen of the committee\r\nappointed to superintend the printing and distribution of them, and\r\nrequested them to furnish you with a set, which I doubt not will be\r\ncomplied with.\r\n\r\nSome short time before the appointment of a Superintendent of Finance,\r\nI transmitted to Congress the most perfect information I was able to\r\ncollect, of many of the matters mentioned in your letter; and it was my\r\nintention, from time to time, to have continued these communications\r\nto Mr. Morris; but our laws remaining so long unprinted, the dispersed\r\nsituation of the different public officers, and the difficulty,\r\nfrom this circumstance, as well as the want of authority, in some\r\ninstances, to command the necessary returns, rendered it a business,\r\nif not impracticable, requiring more time and attention than the\r\nindispensable duties of my office afforded leisure to bestow. I shall,\r\nhowever, be happy to give you every aid in my power to facilitate it.\r\nThe laws, with the returns which have lately been made by the different\r\npublic officers, and may be found on the files of the Legislature, and\r\nin the treasurer’s office, will answer most of the questions stated.\r\nThe answers to the others, appear to me to depend, in some measure,\r\non matter of opinion; and, as the operation of our laws is often\r\nobstructed, and the intended consequences defeated, by unforeseen\r\nevents arising from our embarrassed situation, they cannot be given\r\nwith any great degree of precision.\r\n\r\nYou will readily perceive, sir, that the treasurer, from the nature of\r\nhis office, is not, except in cases provided for by law, subject to my\r\ncontrol. I am persuaded, however, that he, as well as the clerks of the\r\nLegislature, will readily give you every information and assistance\r\nconsistent with the duties of their respective offices.\r\n\r\n                                    I am, with great respect and esteem,\r\n                                    Sir, your most obedient servant,\r\n                                    Geo. Clinton.\r\n\r\nTo Col. Alexander Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPICKERING TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  New-Windsor, August 20, 1782.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nI have some Bills of Exchange, drawn by Mr. Morris on John Swanwick,\r\nwhich I am authorized to exchange with the receivers of the Continental\r\nTaxes in any of the States eastward of Pennsylvania. Mr. Morris\r\ninformed me, that he had advised the Receivers of this measure, and\r\ndirected their taking up the bills whenever they were in cash. By taxes\r\nor by loan, I expect this State will shortly furnish you with money. I\r\nam indebted to the subjects of it by many special engagements, which I\r\nam anxious to fulfil. You will therefore greatly oblige me, by giving\r\nme, from time to time, information of the money you shall receive; and\r\nin order to secure the earliest supply, I would lodge, if you please,\r\nsome of the bills in your hands. Bank notes or Mr. Morris’s notes will\r\nbe useful to me, though not so beneficial as cash.\r\n\r\n                                             I am, dear Sir,\r\n                                             With respect and esteem,\r\n                                             Your most obedient servant,\r\n                                             Tim. Pickering,\r\n                                             _Q. M. G._\r\n\r\nCol. Alex. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO MORRIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       Albany, August 25, 1782.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nThis letter serves only to transmit the two last papers. I wish the\r\nmeasures I have taken to satisfy you on the points you desire to be\r\ninformed of, had been attended with so much success as to enable me\r\nnow to transmit the result. But I find a singular confusion in the\r\naccounts kept by the public officers from whom I must necessarily\r\nderive my information, and a singular dilatoriness in complying with\r\nmy application, partly from indolence, and partly from jealousy of the\r\noffice. I hope, by the next post, to transmit you information on some\r\nparticulars.\r\n\r\n                                            I have the honor to be, Sir,\r\n                                            Your most obedient servant,\r\n                                            A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Robert Morris, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO MEADE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       Albany, August 27, 1782.\r\n\r\nI thank you, my dear Meade, for your letter of the first of this month,\r\nwhich you will perceive has travelled much faster than has been usual\r\nwith our letters. Our correspondence, hitherto, has been unfortunate;\r\nnor, in fact, can either of us compliment himself on his punctuality;\r\nbut you were right in concluding, that however indolence, or accident,\r\nmay interrupt our intercourse, nothing will interrupt our friendship.\r\nMine for you is built on the solid basis of a full conviction that you\r\ndeserve it, and that it is reciprocal; and it is the more firmly fixed\r\nbecause you have few competitors. Experience is a continual comment on\r\nthe worthlessness of the human race; and the few exceptions we find\r\nhave the greater right to be valued in proportion as they are rare. I\r\nknow few men estimable, fewer amiable; and when I meet with one of the\r\nlast description, it is not in my power to withhold my affection.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs to myself, I shall sit down in New-York when it opens; and this\r\nperiod, we are told, approaches. No man looks forward to a peace with\r\nmore pleasure than I do; though no man would sacrifice less to it than\r\nmyself, if I were not convinced the people sigh for peace.\r\n\r\nI have been studying the law for some months, and have lately been\r\nlicensed as an attorney. I wish to prepare myself by October for\r\nexamination as a counsellor; but some public avocation may possibly\r\nprevent me.\r\n\r\nI had almost forgotten to tell you, that I have been pretty unanimously\r\nelected, by the Legislature of this State, a member of Congress, to\r\nbegin to serve in November. I do not hope to reform the State, although\r\nI shall endeavor to do all the good I\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                                   God bless you,\r\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Colonel Meade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMORRIS TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Office of Finance, August 28, 1782.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nI have duly received your several favors of the twenty-second and\r\ntwenty-seventh of July, and tenth and thirteenth of August. My not\r\nanswering them is owing to causes which you will easily conceive,\r\nbecause you will easily conceive the multiplicity of objects to which\r\nI must turn my attention. I am very sorry to learn that you can no\r\nlonger continue in the office of Receiver. It would have given me great\r\npleasure that you should have done so, because I am sure that you would\r\nhave rendered very signal service to the public cause: this you will\r\nnow do in another line, more important, as it is more extensive: and\r\nthe justness of your sentiments on public affairs, induces my warm\r\nwish, that you may find a place in Congress so agreeable as that you\r\nmay be induced to continue in it.\r\n\r\nI should readily have complied with your wish, as to a successor, but\r\nthere are many reasons which have called my attention to, and fixed\r\nmy choice upon, Doctor Tillotson. We will converse on this subject\r\nwhen we meet. I am, however, very far from being unmindful of your\r\nrecommendations; and although I cannot name the citizen of any State\r\nto settle the accounts of that particular State, consistently with\r\nthe general line of conduct I have laid down for myself; yet I shall\r\ndo, in other respects, what is in my power. I have not hitherto been\r\nable to fix on a proper Commissioner for the State of New-York. The\r\noffice is vacant for New Hampshire and Rhode Island. I inclose you a\r\ncopy of the Ordinance on the subject, that you may know the powers,\r\nduties, and emoluments; and I have to request that you offer these\r\nplaces to Colonel Malcolm and Mr. Lawrence. You will make the first\r\noffer, including the choice, as your own judgment may direct. Should\r\nthe gentlemen, or either of them, accept, you will be so kind as to\r\ngive me early notice. I will then immediately recommend them to the\r\nStates respectively; and on receiving their approbation, the proper\r\ninstructions, etc., can be expedited.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to learn that any letter of mine should have given offence;\r\nbut I conclude that this effect must follow from many parts of my\r\nwritings and conduct; because the steady pursuit of what appears to\r\nbe the true line of duty, will necessarily cross the various oblique\r\nviews of interest and opinion. To offend is sometimes a fault, always\r\na misfortune. The letter in question is, I suppose, under the date of\r\nthe eleventh of December, of which I inclose you a copy. Let me, at\r\nthe same time, assure you, that in all your excellent letter of the\r\nthirteenth instant, I most esteem the clause now in question; because\r\nit contains that useful information which is least common. I will make\r\nno apologies for the letter to any one, because apologies are rarely\r\nuseful; and where the intention has been good, they are, to candid\r\nminds, unnecessary. Possessed of the facts, you can guard against\r\nmisrepresentation; and I have ever found that to be the most hostile\r\nweapon which either my personal or political enemies have been able to\r\nwield against me.\r\n\r\nI have not, _even yet_, seen the Resolutions of your Legislature\r\nrelative to an extension of the powers of Congress. I had supposed\r\nthe same reason for them which you have expressed. Indeed, power is\r\ngenerally such a darling object with weak minds, that they must feel\r\nextreme reluctance to bid it farewell; neither do I believe that any\r\nthing will induce a general consent to part with it, but a perfect\r\nsense of absolute necessity. This may arise from two sources; the one\r\nof reason, and the other of feeling: the former more safe and more\r\nuncertain; the latter always severe and often dangerous. It is, my dear\r\nsir, in circumstances like this, that a patriot mind, seeking the great\r\ngood of the whole, on enlightened principles, can best be distinguished\r\nfrom those vulgar souls whose narrow optics can see but the little\r\ncircle of selfish concerns. Unhappily, such souls are but too common,\r\nand but too often fill the seats of dignity and authority. A firm,\r\nwise, manly system of federal government is what I once wished, what I\r\nnow hope, what I dare not expect, but what I will not despair of. Your\r\ndescription of the mode of collecting taxes, contains an epitome of the\r\nfollies which prevail from one end of the continent to the other. There\r\nis no end to the absurdity of human nature. Mankind seem to delight in\r\ncontrast and paradox; for surely nothing else could sanctify (during\r\na contest on the precise point of being taxed by our own consent) the\r\narbitrary policy which, on this subject, almost universally prevails.\r\nGod grant you success in your views to amend it. Your ideas on the\r\nsubject are perfectly correspondent to my own. As to your doubt on the\r\nmode of collecting it, I would wish to obviate it by the observation,\r\nthat the farther off we can remove the appointment of Collectors from\r\npopular influence, the more effectual will be their operations; and\r\nthe more they conform to the views of Congress, the more effectually\r\nwill they enable that body to provide for general defence. In political\r\nlife, the creature will generally pay some deference to both. The\r\nhaving a double set of officers is indeed an evil; but a good thing is\r\nnot always to be rejected because of that necessary portion of evil\r\nwhich, in the course of things, must be attached to it. Neither is this\r\na necessary evil; for, with a proper Federal Government, Army, Navy,\r\nand Revenue, the Civil Administration might well be provided for by a\r\nStamp Act, Roads by Turnpikes, and Navigations by Tolls.\r\n\r\nThe account you give of the State is by no means flattering: and\r\nthe more true it appears, the more concern it gives me. The loan, I\r\nhope, will be completed; and I wish the _whole_ amount of the tax\r\nmay be collected. The Forage plan I have disagreed to; and inclose,\r\nfor your information, the copy of my letter, on that subject, to the\r\nQuartermaster General. I believe your State is exhausted: but perhaps\r\neven you consider it as being more so than it is. The Certificates,\r\nwhich now form a useless load, will (if the United States adopt,\r\nand the several States agree to, a plan now before Congress) become\r\nvaluable property. This will afford great relief. The scarcity of\r\nmoney, also, may be immediately relieved, if the love of popular\r\nfavor would so far give way to the love of public good, as to enforce\r\nplentiful taxation. The necessity of having money will always produce\r\nmoney. The desire of having it, produces, you see, so much as is\r\nnecessary to gratify the desire of enjoying foreign luxuries. Turn\r\nthe stream, which now flows in the channels of Commerce, to those of\r\nRevenue, and the business is completed. Unfortunately for us, this is\r\nan operation which requires fortitude, perseverance, virtue; and which\r\ncannot be effected by the weak or wicked minds who have only partial,\r\nprivate, or interested views.\r\n\r\nWhen I consider the exertions which the country you possess has already\r\nmade, under striking disadvantages, and with astonishing prodigality of\r\nnational wealth, by pernicious modes of applying it; I persuade myself,\r\nthat regular, consistent efforts, would produce much more than you\r\nsuppose.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                             I am, with perfect respect,\r\n                                             Your most obedient\r\n                                             And humble servant,\r\n                                             Robert Morris.\r\n\r\nTo Alexander Hamilton, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO ROBERT MORRIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       Albany, August 31, 1782.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nI send you herewith all the acts of the Legislature of this State\r\nsince the Government has been organized; on the margin of which I have\r\nnumbered all the acts relative to the matters you mention in your\r\nletter of July, ’81, to the States agreeable to the within list. I\r\ninclose you the papers of the last week.\r\n\r\nThe indolence of some, and the repugnancy of others, make every trifle\r\nlag so much in the execution, that I am not able at this time to give\r\nyou any further information. I wish to hear from you on the subject of\r\nmy former letters previous to the meeting of the Committee--the 15th of\r\nthe ensuing month.\r\n\r\n                                      I have the honor to be very truly,\r\n                                      Sir, your most obedient servant,\r\n                                      A. H.\r\n\r\nTo the Honorable Superintendent of Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR CLINTON TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Poughkeepsie, September 2, 1782.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nI am favored with your letter of the 25th instant, previous to which,\r\nwith a view of accelerating the collection of the last Tax, I had\r\nprepared, and have since dispatched a circular letter to the several\r\nCounty Treasurers, urging them and the other officers concerned, to a\r\nprompt execution of their duty, or that in case of neglect the penalty\r\nof the law will without favor be put into execution.\r\n\r\nI have not received information from all the Counties, but in this and\r\nsome others, I know the business is in good train, and am led to hope\r\nthat the taxes will be speedily collected and paid in.\r\n\r\nMy agents employed to procure moneys on loan had some time since\r\ntransmitted me a small sum, but not sufficient to answer the orders\r\nof the Legislature in favor of the Delegates and some other public\r\nmatters. As the channel through which this money is procured is subject\r\nto interruption and disappointment, I cannot at present inform you of\r\nany sum to be depended on, but I expect soon to see or hear from the\r\ngentlemen, and you may rest assured of being informed of the result\r\nwithout delay.\r\n\r\n                                    I am, with great respect and esteem,\r\n                                    Sir, your most obedient servant,\r\n                                    Geo. Clinton.\r\n\r\n\r\nCol. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO THE COUNTY TREASURERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     Albany, September 7, 1782.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nThe fifteenth of this month is the period fixed for the payment of\r\nthe tax imposed at the last meeting of the Legislature for the use of\r\nthe United States. The public exigencies, and the reputation of the\r\nState, require that every exertion should be made to collect this tax\r\nwith punctuality and dispatch; and it is, therefore, my duty to urge\r\nyou, that you employ the powers vested in you, and all your personal\r\ninfluence, to induce the collectors to expedite the collection with all\r\nthe zeal and vigor in their power. While the other States are all doing\r\nsomething, as a citizen of this, I shall feel a sensible mortification\r\nin being obliged to continue publishing to the others, that this\r\nState pays nothing in support of the war, as I have been under the\r\nnecessity of doing the last two months. Besides this, and other still\r\nmore weighty considerations, a regard to the subjects of the State\r\nitself demands every exertion in our power. They have parted with their\r\nproperty on the public faith, and it is impossible for the public to\r\nfulfil its engagements to individuals, unless it is enabled to do it by\r\nthe equal and just contributions of the community at large.\r\n\r\n                                             I am, Sir,\r\n                                             Your most obedient servant,\r\n                                             A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO MORRIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     Albany, September 7, 1782.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nI have had the inclosed ready for some time; but in hopes of receiving\r\nthe returns of the certificates mentioned in memorandum B, I delayed\r\nsending the present sketch. Having even received no answers from some\r\nof the parties, who live at a distance from me, I suspect they have\r\ndone their business in so disorderly a manner (to say nothing worse of\r\nit) that they are at a loss how to render the accounts; and I have,\r\ntherefore, concluded not to detain any longer what I have procured.\r\n\r\nI do not take the step mentioned in memorandum A, because I doubted\r\nits propriety. It might raise expectations about the old money, which,\r\npossibly, it may not enter into your plans to raise: and, besides\r\nthis, by knowing what has been called in, in each State (which from\r\nthe sketch I send you, will appear as to this), you can determine the\r\nbalance of emissions remaining out, except what may have worn out and\r\nbeen accidentally destroyed. If you desire this step to be taken, I\r\nwill obey your commands.\r\n\r\nI have said nothing of the rates of depreciation, because I imagine\r\nyour letter, written in July, ’80, had reference to the rates at which\r\nthe money was then actually circulating, and the circulation has now\r\ntotally ceased. The laws I sent you by the last post, will inform you\r\nof the rates fixed at different periods by the Legislature: forty,\r\nseventy-five, and lastly, one hundred and twenty-eight. I am obliged to\r\ninfer there is a studied backwardness in the officers of the State, who\r\nought to give me the information you require respecting the supplies\r\nof different kinds which have been furnished to the use of the United\r\nStates. Indeed, I find, on inquiry, that their joint information will\r\nnot be so full as to satisfy your intentions; and that this cannot be\r\ndone till you have appointed a commissioner of accounts, authorized to\r\nenter into all the details, aided by some legislative arrangement which\r\nmay be obtained the next session.\r\n\r\n                                        I have the honor to be,\r\n                                        With great respect and esteem,\r\n                                        Sir, your most obedient servant,\r\n                                        A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Robert Morris, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO TIMOTHY PICKERING.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     Albany, September 7, 1782.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nI this day received your letter of the 20th August. Mr. Morris has\r\nadvised me of the bills you describe, and directed my purchasing them,\r\ntogether with his notes, and the bank notes; with what money shall come\r\ninto my hands on public account. They are now beginning to collect the\r\ntax imposed for the use of the United States, though I can as yet form\r\nno judgment with what success or expedition. I shall with pleasure give\r\nyou the information you ask, but I would rather wish to be excused from\r\nanticipation by previous deposits in my hands, as that will in some\r\nmeasure pledge me to give a preference to the bills deposited, and may\r\nhereafter expose me to a charge of partiality. There have been several\r\napplications to me for a similar anticipation which I have avoided;\r\nreserving to myself the power of paying the bills as they shall be\r\npresented, and in proportion to the nearness or remoteness of the\r\nperiods of payments.\r\n\r\nYou may, however, depend that I shall be happy to assist your\r\ndepartment, and will keep in view your present request. I hope, towards\r\nthe latter end of the month, I shall receive something considerable on\r\nthe late tax.\r\n\r\n                                             I am, dear Sir, very truly,\r\n                                             Your obedient servant,\r\n                                             A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n  To Timothy Pickering,\r\n  D. Q. Gen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO ROBERT MORRIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        Albany, Sept. 14, 1782.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th\r\nof August, the contents of which shall be executed.\r\n\r\nI have just received by the post accounts of the specific supplies\r\nfurnished by the State; copies of which I shall prepare to be\r\ntransmitted to you by the next post, as I am to return the originals,\r\nwhich are for the inspection of the Legislature. I hope to add to these\r\naccounts of the moneys supplied.\r\n\r\nI have written to you a number of letters since my journey to\r\nPoughkeepsie, of which, as they contain some things of a confidential\r\nnature, I am not without anxiety to learn the safe arrival.\r\n\r\nI should also have been happy to have received your instructions\r\nagainst the meeting of the Committee, which is to take place to-morrow.\r\nAs they will have other business, if I hear from you by the next post,\r\nI shall not be too late. I am at a loss to know whether I ought to\r\npress the establishment of permanent _funds_ or not; though unless I\r\nreceive your instructions, following my own apprehensions of what are\r\nprobably your views, I shall dwell on this article.\r\n\r\n                                             I have the honor to be,\r\n                                             With perfect respect,\r\n                                             Sir, your most ob’t serv’t,\r\n                                             A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nI inclose you a copy of a letter of the Governor, of the 2d inst., from\r\nwhich you will see his hopes. Mine are not so good. In this vicinity,\r\nalways delinquent, little is doing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO ROBERT MORRIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        Albany, Sept. 21, 1782.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nThe hurry in which I wrote to you by the last post, prevented my\r\nexamining particularly the papers which I informed you I had received.\r\nOn a more careful inspection of them, I found them not so complete as\r\nI had hoped. There is a general state of specific supplies; but the\r\nreturns referred to in that for the particulars, were by some mistake\r\nomitted. I have written for them, but they have not yet arrived; when\r\nthey do, I shall lose no time in forwarding them.\r\n\r\nI observe there is nothing respecting transportation; and there is a\r\npart of the supplies for the period before Col. Hay came into office,\r\nwhich is estimated on a scale of proportion--too vague a method\r\nto be satisfactory. I have urged him to send me an account of the\r\ntransportation, and to collect, as speedily as possible, official\r\nreturns of the supplies above mentioned.\r\n\r\nThere is a practice obtaining which appears to me to contravene your\r\nviews. The Contractors, I am informed, have gotten into a method of\r\ncarrying your bills immediately to the Collectors and drawing the\r\nspecie out of their hands, by which means the paper never goes into\r\ncirculation at all; but passes, so to speak, immediately out of one\r\nhand of the public into the other. The people, therefore, can never be\r\nfamiliarized to the paper, nor can it ever obtain a general currency.\r\n\r\nIf the specie were to come into the Receivers’ hands, and the\r\nContractors were left under a necessity of exerting their influence to\r\ninduce the inhabitants to take your notes, to be afterwards redeemed by\r\nthe Receivers agreeably to your plan, this would gradually accustom the\r\npeople to place confidence in the notes; and though the circulation at\r\nfirst should be momentary, it might come to be more permanent.\r\n\r\nI am in doubt, whether on the mere speculation of an evil, without your\r\ninstructions, I ought to take any step to prevent this practice. For,\r\nshould I forbid the exchange, it might possibly cause a suspicion that\r\nthere was a preference of the paper to the specie, which might injure\r\nits credit.\r\n\r\nI have thought of a method to prevent, without forbidding it in direct\r\nterms. This was to require each collector to return the names of the\r\npersons from whom he received taxes, and in different columns, specify\r\nthe kind of money, whether specie, your notes, or bank notes, in which\r\nthe tax was paid; giving the inhabitants receipts accordingly; and\r\npaying in money in the same species in which it was received. This\r\nwould cover the object.\r\n\r\nI have tried to prevail upon the county treasurer of this place, to\r\ninstruct the collectors accordingly; but the great aim of all these\r\npeople is to avoid trouble; and he affected to consider the matter as a\r\nHerculean labor. Nor will it be done without a legislative injunction.\r\n\r\nA method of this kind would tend much to check fraud in the collectors;\r\nand would have many good consequences.\r\n\r\nI thought it my duty, at any rate, to apprise you of the practice,\r\nthat, if my apprehensions are right, it may not be continued without\r\ncontrol. I have reason to believe it is very extensive--by no means\r\nconfined to this State.\r\n\r\nPermit me to make one more observation. Your notes, though in credit\r\nwith the merchants by way of remittance, do not enter far into ordinary\r\ncirculation, and this principally on account of their size; which even\r\nmakes them inconvenient for paying taxes. The taxes of very few amount\r\nto twenty dollars a single tax; and though the farmers might combine to\r\nsell their produce for the notes, to pay the taxes jointly; yet this is\r\nnot always convenient, and will seldom be practised. If the notes were,\r\nin considerable part, of five, eight, or ten dollars, their circulation\r\nwould be far more general; the merchants would, even in their retail\r\noperations, give specie in exchange for balances; which few of them\r\ncare to do, or can do, with the larger notes; though they are willing\r\nto take them for their goods.\r\n\r\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO MORRIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     September 28, 1782.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nI have been honored this week with your letters of the twenty-eighth\r\nof August, and the sixth, twelfth, and seventeenth instant, with their\r\ninclosures.\r\n\r\nIt gives me the most real pleasure to find that my past communications\r\nhave met with your approbation; and I feel a particular satisfaction\r\nin the friendly confidence which your letters manifest. I am persuaded\r\nthat substantial reasons have determined your choice in a particular\r\ninstance to Doctor Tillotson; and I am flattered by the attention you\r\nhave obligingly paid to my recommendations of Colonel Malcolm and Mr.\r\nLawrence. Those gentlemen are now here. They make you the warmest\r\nacknowledgments for your offer, but decline leaving the State; which,\r\nindeed, is not compatible with the present prospects of either of them.\r\n\r\nI am glad to have had an opportunity of perusing your letter to this\r\nState, at which so much exception has been taken; because it has\r\nconfirmed me in what I presumed, that there has been much unjustifiable\r\nill-humor upon the occasion. I will make use of the knowledge I have to\r\ncombat misrepresentation.\r\n\r\nYours of the twenty-ninth of July to Congress, is full of principles\r\nand arguments as luminous as they are conclusive. It is to be lamented\r\nthat they have not had more weight than we are to infer from the\r\nmomentary expedient adopted by the resolutions of the fourth and tenth;\r\nwhich will, alone, not be satisfactory to the public creditors; and\r\nI fear will only tend to embarrass your present operations, without\r\nanswering the end in view. The more I see, the more I find reason for\r\nthose who love this country to weep over its blindness.\r\n\r\nThe committee on the subject of taxation are met. Some have their\r\nplans; and they must protect their own children, however misshapen:\r\nothers have none; but are determined to find fault with all. I expect\r\nlittle, but I shall promote any thing, though imperfect, that will mend\r\nour situation.\r\n\r\n                                        With sentiments of\r\n                                        The greatest respect and esteem,\r\n                                        I have the honor to be, Sir,\r\n                                        Your most obedient servant,\r\n                                        A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nP.S. The public creditors in this quarter, have had a meeting, and\r\nappointed a committee to devise measures. The committee will report\r\npetitions to Congress and the Legislature; and an address to the\r\npublic creditors in other parts of the State, to appoint persons to\r\nmeet in convention, to unite in some common measure. I believe they\r\nwill also propose a general convention of all the creditors in the\r\ndifferent States.\r\n\r\n                                                                   A. H.\r\n\r\nTo the Hon. Robert Morris, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO MORRIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                          Albany, Oct. 5, 1782.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nIn my last I informed you, that the committee, appointed by the\r\nLegislature on the subject of taxation, were together. In spite of my\r\nefforts, they have parted without doing any thing decisive. They have,\r\nindeed, agreed upon several matters, and those of importance; but they\r\nhave not reduced them to the form of a report; which, in fact, leaves\r\nevery thing afloat, to be governed by the impressions of the moment,\r\nwhen the Legislature meets.\r\n\r\nThe points agreed upon, are these: That there shall be an actual\r\nvaluation of land, and a tax of so much in the pound.\r\n\r\nThe great diversity in the qualities of land would not suffer them\r\nto listen to an estimated valuation, or to a tax by the quantity,\r\nagreeably to the idea in your late report to Congress. That there shall\r\nbe also a tariff of all personal property, to be also taxed at so much\r\nin the pound; that there shall be a specific tax on carriages, clocks,\r\nwatches, and other similar articles of luxury; that money, at usury,\r\nshall be taxed at a fixed rate in the pound, excluding that which is\r\nloaned to the public; that houses, in all towns, shall be taxed at a\r\ncertain proportion of the annual rent; that there shall be a poll tax\r\non all single men from fifteen upwards; and that the collection of the\r\ntaxes should be advertised to the lowest bidder, at a fixed rate per\r\ncent., bearing all subordinate expenses.\r\n\r\nAmong other things which were rejected, I pressed hard for an excise on\r\ndistilled liquors; but all that could be carried on this article was a\r\nlicense on taverns.\r\n\r\nThe committee were pretty generally of opinion, that the system of\r\nfunding for payment of old debts, and for procuring further credit, was\r\nwise and indispensable; but a majority thought it would be unwise in\r\none State to contribute in this way alone.\r\n\r\nNothing was decided on the quantum of taxes which the State was able to\r\npay: those who went furthest, did not exceed seventy thousand pounds,\r\nof which fifty for the use of the United States.\r\n\r\nI send you my cash account, which is for what has been received in this\r\ncounty. We have not heard from the others.\r\n\r\n                                            I have the honor to be, Sir,\r\n                                            Your most obedient servant,\r\n                                            A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nTo the Hon. Robert Morris, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMORRIS TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Office of Finance, October 5, 1782.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nI have now before me your letters of the fourteenth and twenty-first\r\nof last month. I am sorry to find that you are less sanguine in your\r\npecuniary expectations than the Governor appears to be; for I have\r\nalways found that the worst forebodings on this subject are the truest.\r\nYou will find, at the bottom of this letter, a list of all those which\r\nI have hitherto received from you. I think they have all been already\r\nacknowledged; but lest they should not, you will see in one moment, by\r\nthe list, whether any have miscarried.\r\n\r\nI am not surprised to find that the contractors apply with their\r\npaper, in the first instance, to the Receivers and Collectors. This I\r\nexpected, because much of that paper is not fit for other purposes.\r\nSome of it, however, which is payable to the bearer, is calculated for\r\ncirculation; which you observe is not so general as otherwise it might\r\nhave been, by reason of the largeness of the sums expressed in the\r\nnotes. Mr. Duer’s letters contain the same sentiment.\r\n\r\nIn issuing this paper, one principal view was to facilitate the payment\r\nof taxes by obviating the too general (though unjust) complaint of the\r\nwant of a circulating medium. In substituting paper to specie, the\r\nfirst obstacle to be encountered, was the total diffidence which had\r\narisen from the late profusion of it. Had a considerable quantity been\r\nthrown into the hands of that class of the people, whose ideas on the\r\nsubject of money, are more the offspring of habit than of reason, it\r\nmust have depreciated. That this apprehension was just, is clear from\r\nthis fact, that the paper I first issued, and the Bank paper which\r\ncame out after it, did depreciate from ten to fifteen per cent. in the\r\nEastern States, notwithstanding all the precautions which were used.\r\nIf I had not taken immediate measures to create a demand for it on the\r\nspot, and to stop issues to that quarter, its credit would have been\r\ntotally lost for a time, and not easily restored. Besides that, the\r\nquantities which were pouring in from thence would have done mischief\r\nhere. Confidence is a plant of very slow growth; and our political\r\nsituation is not too favorable to it. I am, therefore, very unwilling\r\nto hazard the germ of a credit, which will, in its greater maturity,\r\nbecome very useful. If my notes circulate only among mercantile people,\r\nI do not regret it, but rather wish that the circulation may, for the\r\npresent, be confined to them, and to the wealthier members of other\r\nprofessions. It is nothing but the greater convenience, which will\r\ninduce people to prefer any kind of paper to the precious metals;\r\nand this convenience is principally felt in large sums. Whenever the\r\nshopkeepers, in general, discover that my paper will answer as a\r\nremittance to the principal ports, and will be readily exchanged by\r\nthe Receivers, they will as readily exchange it for other people. When\r\nthe people, in general, find that the shopkeepers receive it freely,\r\nthey will begin to look after it, and not before. For you must know,\r\nthat whatever fine plausible speeches may be made on this subject,\r\nthe farmers will not give full credit to money, merely because it will\r\npay taxes: for that is an object they are not very violently devoted\r\nto. But that money which goes freely at the store and the tavern,\r\nwill be sought after as greedily as those things which the store and\r\nthe tavern contain. Still, however, your objection remains good; that\r\nthe traffickings in which the greater part of the community engage,\r\ndo not require sums so large as twenty dollars. This I shall readily\r\nacknowledge: but you will observe there is infinitely less danger that\r\nlarge notes, which go only through the hands of intelligent people,\r\nwill be counterfeited than small ones, which come to the possession of\r\nilliterate men. When public credit is firmly established, the little\r\nshocks it receives from the counterfeiters of paper money, do not\r\nlead to material consequences; but, in the present ticklish state of\r\nthings, there is just ground of apprehension. Besides this, the value\r\nof paper will depend much upon the interchanges of it for specie: and\r\nthese will not take place when there is a circulation of small paper.\r\nLastly, I have to observe, that until more reliance can be placed on\r\nthe revenues required, I dare not issue any very considerable amount\r\nof this paper, lest I should be run upon for more than I could answer:\r\nand as the circulation of what I dare issue, by increasing the general\r\nmass, enables people (so far as it goes) more easily to get hold of\r\nother money, it consequently produces, in its degree, that object of\r\nfacilitating taxation which I had in view.\r\n\r\n                                     I am, Sir,\r\n                                     Your most obedient, humble servant,\r\n                                     Robert Morris.\r\n\r\n  Alexander Hamilton, Esq.,\r\n  Receiver for New-York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO DE NOAILLES.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                   1782.\r\n\r\nEsteem for your talents and acquirements is a sentiment which, from\r\nmy earliest acquaintance with you, my dear Viscount, I have shared\r\nin common with all those who have the happiness of knowing you; but\r\na better knowledge of your character has given it, in my eyes, a\r\nmore intrinsic merit, and has attached me to you by a friendship\r\nfounded upon qualities as rare as they are estimable. Averse as I\r\nam to professions, I cannot forbear indulging this declaration, to\r\nexpress to you the pleasure I felt at receiving (after an inexplicable\r\ndelay) the letter you were so obliging as to write me before your\r\ndeparture from Boston. It was of that kind which is always produced\r\nby those attentions of friends we value; which, not being invited by\r\ncircumstances, nor necessitated by the forms of society, bespeak the\r\nwarmth of the heart. At least my partiality for you makes me fond of\r\nviewing it in this light, and I cherish the opinion.\r\n\r\nI was chagrined to find that you left us with an intention not to\r\nreturn. Though I should be happy if, by a removal of the war, this\r\ncountry should cease to be a proper theatre for your exertions, yet,\r\nif it continues to be so, I hope you will find sufficient motives to\r\nengage you to change your resolution. Wherever you are, you will be\r\nuseful and distinguished; but the ardent desire I have of meeting you\r\nagain, makes me wish America may be your destination. I would willingly\r\ndo it in France, as you invite me to do; but the prospect of this\r\nis remote. I must make a more solid establishment here before I can\r\nconveniently go abroad. There is no country I have a greater curiosity\r\nto see, or which I am persuaded would be so interesting to me as yours.\r\nI should be happy to renew and improve the valuable acquaintances from\r\nthence, which this war has given me an opportunity of making; and,\r\nthough I could not flatter myself with deriving any advantage from it,\r\nI am persuaded it is there I should meet with the greatest number of\r\nthose you describe, who, etc.: but considerations of primary importance\r\nwill oblige me to submit to the mortification of deferring my visit.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time I should be too much the gainer by communication with\r\nyou, not gladly to embrace the offer you so politely make for writing\r\nto each other.\r\n\r\nThe period, since you left us, has been too barren of events to\r\nenable me to impart any thing worth attention. The enemy continue in\r\npossession of Charleston and Savannah, and leave us masters of the\r\nrest of the country. General Greene has detached Wayne to Georgia;\r\nbut I believe his views do not extend beyond the mere possession of\r\nthe country. It is said the Assemblies of the two invaded States are\r\nabout meeting, to restore the administration of government. This\r\nwill be a step to strengthening the hands of General Greene, and\r\ncounteracting the future intrigues of the enemy. Many are sanguine in\r\nbelieving that all the southern posts will be evacuated, and that a\r\nfleet of transports is actually gone to bring the garrisons away. For\r\nmy part, I have doubts upon the subject. My politics are, that while\r\nthe present ministry can maintain their seats, and procure supplies,\r\nthey will prosecute the war on the mere chance of events; and that\r\nwhile this is the plan, they will not evacuate posts so essential as\r\npoints of departure; from whence, on any favorable turn of affairs,\r\nto renew their attack on our most vulnerable side. Nor will they\r\nrelinquish objects that would be so useful to them, should the worst\r\nhappen in a final negotiation. Clinton, it is said, is cutting a canal\r\nacross New-York island, through the low grounds, about a mile and a\r\nhalf from the city. This will be an additional obstacle; but if we\r\nhave, otherwise, the necessary means to operate, it will not be an\r\ninsurmountable one. I do not hear that he is constructing any other new\r\nworks of consequence. To you, who are so thoroughly acquainted with\r\nthe military posture of things in this country, I need not say that\r\nthe activity of the next campaign must absolutely depend on effectual\r\nsuccors from France. I am convinced we shall have a powerful advocate\r\nin you. La Fayette, we know, will bring ‘the whole house’ with him if\r\nhe can.\r\n\r\nThere has been no material change in our internal situation since you\r\nleft us. The capital successes we have had, have served rather to\r\nincrease the hopes than the exertions of the particular States. But\r\nin one respect we are in a mending way. Our financier has hitherto\r\nconducted himself with great ability, has acquired an entire personal\r\nconfidence; revived, in some measure, the public credit; and is\r\nconciliating fast the support of the moneyed men. His operations have\r\nhitherto hinged chiefly on the seasonable aids from your country; but\r\nhe is urging the establishment of permanent funds among ourselves: and\r\nthough, from the nature and temper of our governments, his applications\r\nwill meet with a dilatory compliance, it is to be hoped they will by\r\ndegrees succeed.\r\n\r\nThe institution of a Bank has been very serviceable to him: the\r\ncommercial interest, finding great advantages in it, and anticipating\r\nmuch greater, is disposed to promote the plan; and nothing but moderate\r\nfunds, permanently pledged for the security of lenders, is wanting to\r\nmake it an engine of the most extensive and solid utility. By the last\r\nadvices there is reason to believe the delinquent States will shortly\r\ncomply with the requisition of Congress for a duty on our imports.\r\nThis will be a great resource to Mr. Morris; but it will not alone be\r\nsufficient.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, however, if the war continues another year, it will\r\nbe necessary that Congress should again recur to the generosity of\r\nFrance for pecuniary assistance. The plans of the financier cannot be\r\nso matured as to enable us, by any possibility, to dispense with this;\r\nand if he should fail for want of support, we must replunge into that\r\nconfusion and distress which had like to have proved fatal to us, and\r\nout of which we are slowly emerging. The cure, on a relapse, would be\r\ninfinitely more difficult than ever.\r\n\r\nI have given you an uninteresting but a faithful sketch of our\r\nsituation. You may expect, from time to time, to receive from me the\r\nprogress of our affairs; and I know you will over-pay me.\r\n\r\n                                                 I am, my dear Viscount,\r\n                                                 Yours faithfully,\r\n                                                 A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the Viscount De Noailles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO GREENE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      Albany, October 12, 1782.\r\n\r\nDear General:\r\n\r\nIt is an age since I have either written to you or received a line\r\nfrom you; yet I persuade myself you have not been the less convinced\r\nof my affectionate attachment, and warm participation in all those\r\nevents which have given you that place in your country’s esteem and\r\napprobation which I have known you to deserve, while your enemies and\r\nrivals were most active in sullying your reputation.\r\n\r\nYou will perhaps learn, before this reaches you, that I have been\r\nappointed a Member of Congress. I expect to go to Philadelphia in the\r\nensuing month, where I shall be happy to correspond with you with\r\nour ancient confidence; and I shall entreat you not to confine your\r\nobservations to military subjects, but to take in the whole scope of\r\nnational concerns. I am sure your ideas will be useful to me and to the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nI feel the deepest affliction at the news we have just received of the\r\nloss of our dear and estimable friend Laurens. His career of virtue\r\nis at an end. How strangely are human affairs conducted, that so many\r\nexcellent qualities could not insure a more happy fate! The world will\r\nfeel the loss of a man who has left few like him behind, and America\r\nof a citizen whose heart realized that patriotism of which others only\r\ntalk. I shall feel the loss of a friend I truly and most tenderly\r\nloved, and one of a very small number.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                          I am, dear Sir,\r\n                                          Truly your friend and servant,\r\n                                          A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo General Greene.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO ROBERT MORRIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      Albany, October 26, 1782.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nI am honored with your letters of the 5th, 15th, and 16th instant.\r\n\r\nThe detail you have been pleased to enter into in that of the 15th,\r\nexhibits very cogent reasons for confining yourself, to pretty large\r\ndenominations of notes; some of them had occurred to me, others had\r\nnot; but I thought it my duty to state to you the operation which\r\nthat circumstance had; as in the midst of the variety and extent of\r\nthe objects which occupy your attention, you may not have so good\r\nopportunities of seeing the effect of your plans in detail. While I\r\nacknowledge that your observations have corrected my ideas upon the\r\nsubject, and shown me that there would be danger in generally lessening\r\nthe denominations of the paper issued, I should be uncandid not to\r\nadd, that it still appears to me, there would be a preponderance of\r\nadvantages in having a part of a smaller amount. I shall not trouble\r\nyou at present with any further reasons for this opinion.\r\n\r\nI have immediately on the receipt of your letter taken measures for the\r\npublication of your advertisement in the newspapers of this State.\r\n\r\nYou will perceive by the inclosed cash account that I have received\r\nfive and twenty hundred dollars; this was procured in part of the loan\r\nI mentioned to you. It was chiefly paid to me in specie, and I have\r\nexchanged it with Colonel Pickering and Mr. Duer for your notes; the\r\nlatter had twelve hundred dollars. Taxes collect slowly, but I must\r\nshortly receive two or three hundred pounds more, of which Mr. Duer\r\nwill have the principal benefit, as it appears by your letter to him,\r\nthat you hoped he might receive three thousand dollars from me.\r\n\r\nAs I may shortly set out for Philadelphia, I wish to surrender to Mr.\r\nTillotson, as soon as you think proper, the office in which he is to\r\nsucceed.\r\n\r\n                                        I have the honor to be,\r\n                                        With sincere respect and esteem,\r\n                                        Sir, your most obedient servant,\r\n                                        Alex. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO LA FAYETTE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      Albany, November 3, 1782.\r\n\r\nSince we parted, my dear Marquis, at Yorktown, I have received three\r\nletters from you; one written on your way to Boston, two from France.\r\nI acknowledge that I have written to you only once; but the reason\r\nhas been, that I have been taught daily to expect your return. This I\r\nshould not have done from my own calculations; for I saw no prospect\r\nbut of an inactive campaign; and you had much better be intriguing for\r\nyour hobby-horse at Paris, than loitering away your time here. Yet they\r\nseem to be convinced, at head quarters, that you were certainly coming\r\nout; and by your letters it appears to have been your own expectation.\r\nI imagine you have relinquished it by this time.\r\n\r\nI have been employed for the last ten months in rocking the cradle\r\nand studying the art of _fleecing_ my neighbors. I am now a grave\r\ncounsellor-at-law, and shall soon be a grave member of Congress. The\r\nLegislature, at their last session, took it into their heads to name\r\nme, pretty unanimously, one of their delegates.\r\n\r\nI am going to throw away a few months more in public life, and then\r\nretire a simple citizen and good _paterfamilias_. I set out for\r\nPhiladelphia in a few days. You see the disposition I am in. You are\r\ncondemned to run the race of ambition all your life. I am already\r\ntired of the career, and dare to leave it. But you would not give a pin\r\nfor my letter unless politics or war made a part of it. You tell me\r\nthey are employed in building _a peace_: and other accounts say it is\r\nnearly finished. I hope the work may meet with no interruptions. It is\r\nnecessary for America; especially if your army is taken from us, as we\r\nare told will soon be the case. That was an essential _point d’appui_,\r\nthough money was the _primum mobile_ of our finances, which must now\r\nlose the little activity lately given them. Our trade is prodigiously\r\ncramped. These States are in no humor for continuing exertions. If the\r\nwar lasts, it must be carried on by external succors. I make no apology\r\nfor the inertness of this country: I detest it: but since it exists, I\r\nam sorry to see other resources diminish.\r\n\r\nYour Ministers ought to know best what they are doing; but if the war\r\ngoes on, and the removal of the army does not prove an unwise measure,\r\nI renounce all future pretensions to judgment. I think, however, the\r\ncircumstances of the enemy oblige them to peace.\r\n\r\nWe have been hoping that they would abandon their posts in these\r\nStates. It no doubt was once in contemplation, but latter appearances\r\nare rather ambiguous. I begin to suspect that if peace is not made,\r\nNew-York and Charleston, the former at least, will still be held.\r\n\r\nThere is no probability that I shall be one of the Commissioners of\r\nPeace. It is a thing I do not desire myself, and which I imagine other\r\npeople will not desire.\r\n\r\nOur army is now in excellent order, but small.\r\n\r\nThe temper we are in respecting the alliance, you will see from public\r\nacts. There never was a time of greater unanimity on that point.\r\n\r\nI wish I durst enter into a greater detail with you; but our cipher is\r\nnot fit for it, and I fear to trust it in another shape.\r\n\r\nIs there any thing you wish on this side the water? You know the warmth\r\nand sincerity of my attachment. Command me.\r\n\r\nI have not been so happy as to see Mr. De Segur. The title of your\r\nfriend would have been a title to every thing in my power to manifest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                                   Yours _pour la vie_,\r\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nP.S. I wrote a long letter to the Viscount De Noailles, whom I also\r\nlove. Has he received it? Is the worthy Gouvion well? Has he succeeded?\r\nHow is it with our friend Gimat? How is it with General Du Portail? All\r\nthose men are men of merit, and interest my best wishes.\r\n\r\nPoor Laurens! He has fallen a sacrifice to his ardor in a trifling\r\nskirmish in South Carolina. You know how truly I loved him, and will\r\njudge how much I regret him.\r\n\r\nI will write you again soon after my arrival at Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n                                                                   A. H.\r\n\r\nTo the Marquis De La Fayette.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO THE GOVERNOR OF RHODE ISLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   Philadelphia, Dec. 11, 1782.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nCongress are equally affected and alarmed by the information they have\r\nreceived, that the Legislature of your State, at their last meeting,\r\nhave refused their concurrence in establishing a duty on imports. They\r\nconsider this measure as so indispensable to the prosecution of the\r\nwar, that a sense of duty, and regard to the common safety, compel\r\nthem to renew their efforts to engage a compliance with it. And in\r\nthis view, they have determined to send a deputation of three members\r\nto your State, as expressed in the inclosed resolution. The gentlemen\r\nthey have appointed will be able to lay before you a full and just\r\nrepresentation of public affairs, from which, they flatter themselves,\r\nwill result a conviction of the propriety of their solicitude upon\r\nthe present occasion. Convinced by past experience of the zeal and\r\npatriotism of the State of Rhode Island, they cannot doubt that it will\r\nyield to those urgent considerations which flow from a knowledge of our\r\ntrue situation.\r\n\r\nThey will only briefly observe that the increasing discontents of\r\nthe army, the loud clamors of the public creditors, and the extreme\r\ndisproportion between the public supplies and the demands of the public\r\nservice, are so many invincible arguments for the fund recommended by\r\nCongress. They feel themselves unable to devise any other that will\r\nbe more efficacious, less exceptionable, or more generally agreeable;\r\nand if this is refused, they anticipate calamities of a most menacing\r\nnature--with this consolation, however, that they have faithfully\r\ndischarged their trust, and that the mischiefs which follow cannot be\r\nattributed to them.\r\n\r\nA principal object of the proposed fund is to _procure loans abroad_.\r\nIf no security can be held out to lenders, the success of these must\r\nnecessarily be very limited. The last accounts on the subject were not\r\nflattering; and when intelligence shall arrive in Europe, that the\r\nState of Rhode Island has disagreed to the only fund which has yet\r\nbeen devised, there is every reason to apprehend it will have a fatal\r\ninfluence upon their future progress.\r\n\r\nDeprived of this resource, our affairs must in all probability hasten\r\nto a dangerous crisis, and these States be involved in greater\r\nembarrassments than they have yet experienced, and from which it may be\r\nmuch more difficult to emerge. Congress will only add a request to your\r\nExcellency, that if the Legislature should not be sitting, it may be\r\ncalled together as speedily as possible, to enable the gentlemen whom\r\nthey have deputed to perform the purpose of their mission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR CLINTON TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Poughkeepsie, December 29, 1782.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nBefore I was honored by your letter of the eighteenth instant, I had\r\nreceived a line from Colonel Floyd on the same subject. As my answer to\r\nhis is forwarded by the present conveyance, I beg leave to refer you\r\nto it for information. I hope it may prove satisfactory; and I flatter\r\nmyself no further disappointment can take place. Should I, however,\r\nbe mistaken, you have only to advise me of it, and I will immediately\r\nforward the cash.\r\n\r\nPhelps, who was delayed on the road by the late heavy fall of snow,\r\nwaited on me a few days since, and delivered me your official\r\ndispatches of the ninth instant. Considering the disposition heretofore\r\ndiscovered by Congress, on the subject of our controversy with the\r\ngrants, their resolutions which you inclosed me, though short of what\r\nwe are justly entitled to, exceed my expectations; and I am not without\r\nhope, if properly improved, may be the mean of leading to a just and\r\nfavorable issue. The idea of many of the military being interested\r\nin the independency of Vermont, in consequence of their having taken\r\ngrants of lands under them, I believe is without foundation. There\r\nwas a period when the disposition of Congress, founded on political\r\nexpedience, appeared so favorable to the independence of that district,\r\nas to have induced some gentlemen of the army to apply to the usurped\r\ngovernment for grants. But when it was discovered that they were\r\nintriguing with the common enemy, the more respectable characters\r\nwithdrew their applications, and relinquished all kind of connection\r\nwith them; and even those who did not go so far, I imagine conceive\r\nthemselves perfectly secure under our late acts. If, however, this\r\nshould not be the case, any difficulty which may be apprehended from it\r\nmay be easily obviated; as I am persuaded the Legislature are disposed\r\nto every liberal act that may consist with the honor of the State, and\r\ntend to facilitate a settlement of the dispute. There was a time,\r\nnot long since, when Congress had only to have spoken decisively\r\non the subject, and they would have been obeyed: nor do I believe\r\nthe time is yet past, if they could be convinced that Congress were\r\nin earnest. But if force is necessary to carry their decision into\r\nexecution, the longer it is delayed the more force it will require. The\r\nmisfortune is, though I believe there are but few States that favor\r\ntheir independence, some members of those who do, take great pains to\r\nencourage the revolters in their opposition, by secret assurances that\r\nCongress will not direct any coercive measures against them: and I am\r\nnot without my fears that this conduct will, in some measure, defeat\r\nthe present resolutions.\r\n\r\n                                   I am, with great respect and esteem,\r\n                                   Dear Sir, your most obedient servant,\r\n                                   George Clinton.\r\n\r\nTo the Hon. Alexander Hamilton, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLA FAYETTE TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            (Most Private.)\r\n\r\n                                           Cadix, Feb. 5, 1783.\r\n\r\nYour friendship to me, my dear sir, and the affection I have for you,\r\ncommand my most _confidential_ communications. As public affairs\r\nhave the first place with me, let me tell you that our Articles of\r\nConfederation ought to be revised, and measures immediately taken\r\nto invigorate the Continental Union; depend upon it, there lies the\r\ndanger for America; this last stroke is wanting, and unless the States\r\nbe strongly bound to each other, we have much to fear from British,\r\nand, indeed, from European politics. There ought to be delegates from\r\neach State, and perhaps some officers among them, one of whom I would\r\nbe happy to be, who, toward next fall, would meet together, and under\r\nthe presidence of General Washington, may devise upon amendments to\r\nbe proposed in the Articles of Confederation--limits of States, &c.,\r\n&c., &c. As to the army, I hope their country will be grateful, I hope\r\nthe half pay affair may be terminated to their satisfaction. Now, my\r\ndear sir, I am going to torment you with my private concerns. First of\r\nall, I wish the people of America to know that, when I have lengthened\r\nmy furlough, it was for their service, and at the request of their\r\ncommissioners; that upon my embarking in a fresh expedition, it was\r\nwith a view to join you in the summer, with forces adequate to every\r\nplan General Washington had directed me to promote; that, moreover, a\r\nCanadian expedition was to take place; that then, instead of sending a\r\nvessel, I was going myself to America. But that entreaties from your\r\nresidence at Madrid have forced me to go there, and probably from there\r\nto Paris; but that in the month of June, I am to embark for America. I\r\nconfess, my dear sir, I have a great value for my American popularity,\r\nand I want the people at large to know my affection to them and my\r\nzeal for their service. The best way to manage it is to have a resolve\r\nof Congress published, by way of answer to my letters, wherein their\r\napprobation of my conduct will comprehend the above mentioned matters.\r\n\r\nThere is another thing which would highly flatter me, and lies\r\nwithin your department; a ratification of the treaty will be sent by\r\nCongress to the Court of England; it is but an honorary commission,\r\nthat requires only a few weeks, and even a few days’ attendance. The\r\nsedentary Minister you may send, or with me, or after me, or, what I\r\nwould like better, at the time when Great Britain has sent hers to\r\nyou. So many greater proofs of confidence have been bestowed upon\r\nme by Congress, that I may truly tell you my wishes upon this very\r\npleasing mark of their esteem. Upon my leaving England, I have been\r\nconsidered there as an enthusiastic rebel, and, indeed, a young madman.\r\nI would well enough like to present myself there in the capacity of\r\nan Extraordinary Envoy from the United States; and though upon my\r\ncommitting so far the French Ambassador, I have been with him on pretty\r\nbad terms; now our friendship has revived, and I am in a situation to\r\nlead him into my measures, and to know his secrets without telling him\r\nmine.\r\n\r\nAs to the choice of a Minister, (this commission being only a\r\ncompliment,) I think it is a very difficult task. I advise to take a\r\ngentleman who had no connection with the great men in England; our\r\nfriend Hamilton would be a very proper choice; you ought to bring it\r\nabout. Are you acquainted with Col. Harrison, who was in the General’s\r\nfamily; there are few men so honest and sensible; but I hope you may\r\nsend Hamilton, and he knows better than all the British councils.\r\n\r\nIn case Congress were pleased to do for me what I have so much at\r\nheart, I would beg you to send Mr. McHenry to me, a member in the\r\nMaryland Senate. This, my dear sir, is entirely confidential for you,\r\nand _for you alone_; should the General be in Philadelphia, you may\r\nshow it to him. Adieu. My best respects wait upon your lady and family.\r\n\r\n                                                    Most affectionately,\r\n                                                    I am yours,\r\n                                                    La Fayette.\r\n\r\nShould you think it of any use to have printed the last paragraph of\r\nmy letter to Congress, I will be glad of it, as the opinion of one who\r\nknows Europe may have some weight with the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Philadelphia, February 7, 1788.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nFlattering myself that your knowledge of me will induce you to receive\r\nthe observations I make, as dictated by a regard to the public good, I\r\ntake the liberty to suggest to you my ideas on some matters of delicacy\r\nand importance. I view the present juncture as a very interesting one.\r\nI need not observe how far the temper and situation of the army make\r\nit so. The state of our finances was perhaps never more critical. I\r\nam under injunctions which will not permit me to disclose some facts\r\nthat would at once demonstrate this position; but I think it probable\r\nyou will be possessed of them through another channel. It is, however,\r\ncertain, that there has scarcely been a period of the revolution\r\nwhich called more for wisdom and decision in Congress. Unfortunately\r\nfor us, we are a body not governed by reason or foresight, but by\r\ncircumstances. It is probable we shall not take the proper measures;\r\nand if we do not, a few months may open an embarrassing scene. This\r\nwill be the case, whether we have peace or a continuance of the war.\r\n\r\nIf the war continues, it would seem that the army must, in June,\r\nsubsist itself, _to defend the country_. If peace should take place, it\r\n_will_ subsist itself, _to procure justice to itself_. It appears to be\r\na prevailing opinion in the army, that the disposition to recompense\r\ntheir services, will cease with the necessity for them; and that if\r\nthey once lay down their arms, they part with the means of obtaining\r\njustice. It is to be lamented that appearances afford too much ground\r\nfor their distrust.\r\n\r\nIt becomes a serious inquiry, What is the true line of policy? The\r\nclaims of the army, urged with moderation, but with firmness, may\r\noperate on those weak minds which are influenced by their apprehensions\r\nmore than by their judgments, so as to produce a concurrence in the\r\nmeasures which the exigencies of affairs demand. They may add weight\r\nto the applications of Congress to the several States. So far a useful\r\nturn may be given to them. But the difficulty will be, to keep a\r\n_complaining_ and _suffering army_ within the bounds of moderation.\r\n\r\nThis your Excellency’s influence must effect. In order to it, it will\r\nbe advisable not to discountenance their endeavors to procure redress,\r\nbut rather, by the intervention of confidential and prudent persons,\r\n_to take the direction of them_. This, however, must not appear. It\r\nis of moment to the public tranquillity, that your Excellency should\r\npreserve the confidence of the army without losing that of the people.\r\nThis will enable you, in case of extremity, to guide the torrent, and\r\nto bring order, perhaps even good, out of confusion. ’Tis a part that\r\nrequires address; but ’tis one which your own situation, as well as the\r\nwelfare of the community, points out.\r\n\r\nI will not conceal from your Excellency a truth which it is necessary\r\nyou should know. An idea is propagated in the army, that delicacy,\r\ncarried to an extreme, prevents your espousing its interests with\r\nsufficient warmth. The falsehood of this opinion no one can be better\r\nacquainted with than myself; but it is not the less mischievous for\r\nbeing false. Its tendency is to impair that influence which you may\r\nexert with advantage, should any commotions unhappily ensue, to\r\nmoderate the pretensions of the army, and make their conduct correspond\r\nwith their duty.\r\n\r\nThe great _desideratum_ at present, is the establishment of general\r\nfunds, which alone can do justice to the creditors of the United States\r\n(of whom the army forms the most meritorious class), restore public\r\ncredit, and supply the future wants of government. This is the object\r\nof all men of sense. In this, the influence of the army, properly\r\ndirected, may co-operate.\r\n\r\nThe intimations I have thrown out, will suffice to give your Excellency\r\na proper conception of my sentiments. You will judge of their\r\nreasonableness or fallacy; but I persuade myself you will do justice to\r\nmy motives.\r\n\r\n                                                I have the honor to be,\r\n                                                With great respect,\r\n                                                Your Excellency’s\r\n                                                Most obedient servant,\r\n                                                Alex. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nGeneral Knox has the confidence of the army, and is a man of sense. I\r\nthink he may be safely made use of. Situated as I am, your Excellency\r\nwill feel the confidential nature of these observations.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency General Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDUANE TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Newburgh, 17th February, 1783.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nI am now on a visit from the General from Kingston, where the\r\nLegislature is convened. The British King’s speech----to his\r\nParliament, and his Secretary’s letters to the Lord Mayor of London,\r\nwhich we had the pleasure of meeting here, afford us the fairest\r\nprospect of a speedy peace. I have but one anxiety remaining, and\r\nthat respects a better establishment of our General Government on\r\na basis that will secure the permanent union of the States, and a\r\npunctual payment of the public debts. I do not think our Legislature\r\nwill be averse to a reasonable system. The Assembly have agreed to the\r\nrequisitions of Congress, and to press for the arrears of taxes; and\r\na joint committee of both Houses have taken measures to compel the\r\nimmediate production of the accounts of all who have been intrusted\r\nwith public money. This last step became so necessary, that I found\r\nno difficulty in getting it adopted. I would even hazard an attempt\r\nto introduce an intendant, if I had proper materials; but I am\r\ndisappointed in not receiving the Maryland plan, which was promised\r\nme by Mr. Wright and Mr. Homsly. If possible, I still wish you would\r\nforward this act on this subject, and for the collection of taxes. The\r\nexample of a State may be adopted, when any plan of my own might be\r\nrejected. There is such confusion in the present administration of our\r\nState finances, and the weight of our debts is so burthensome, that a\r\nremedy must be provided; and I apprehend the production of the public\r\naccounts, before alluded to, will furnish us with sufficient arguments\r\nto prove its necessity.\r\n\r\nWe are in want of the report, and of the evidence and arguments in\r\nsupport of our Territorial rights. If, as you proposed, you have taken\r\nthe trouble to copy it, be so obliging as to transmit your copy. Should\r\nyour leisure not have been sufficient for the undertaking, be pleased\r\nto get it transcribed and forwarded. It is a collection of great\r\nimportance to the State, and if it should be lost, I do not know who\r\nwould submit to the labor of a second effort.\r\n\r\nGeneral Schuyler was sent for a week ago to pay the last duties to\r\nyour grandfather. He wrote me the tenth, that there was no hopes\r\nof his surviving many days, but I learn that he was still living\r\nfour days ago, without the least prospect of recovery. From your\r\nknown punctuality, I take it for granted that you have written to me\r\nagreeably to your promise, and that your letters have miscarried. Any\r\ncommunication, while the Legislature are convened, would be peculiarly\r\nacceptable, and probably useful.\r\n\r\nBe pleased to present my respectful compliments to Colonel Floyd, to\r\nMrs. Hamilton, and Mr. and Mrs. Carter, and to the gentlemen of our\r\nfamily, etc.\r\n\r\n                             With the utmost regard, I remain, dear Sir,\r\n                             Your affectionate and most\r\n                             Obedient humble servant,\r\n                             Jas. Duane.\r\n\r\nColonel Alexander Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO GOVERNOR CLINTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                      February, 24, 1783\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nIn my letter of the fourteenth I informed your Excellency, that\r\nCongress were employed in devising a plan for carrying the eighth\r\narticle of the Confederation into execution. This business is at\r\nlength brought to a conclusion. I inclose, for the information of the\r\nLegislature, the proceedings upon it in different stages, by which\r\nthey will see the part I have acted. But as I was ultimately left in a\r\nsmall minority, I think it my duty to explain the motives upon which my\r\nopposition to the general course of the House was founded.\r\n\r\nI am of opinion, that the article of the Confederation itself was\r\nill-judged. In the first place, I do not believe there is any general\r\nrepresentative of the wealth of a nation, the criterion of its ability\r\nto pay taxes. There are only two that can be thought of, _land_ and\r\n_numbers_.\r\n\r\nThe revenues of the United Provinces (general and particular) were\r\ncomputed, before the present war, to more than half as much as those\r\nof Great Britain. The extent of their territory is not one-fourth part\r\nas great; their population less than a third. The comparison is still\r\nmore striking between those Provinces and the Swiss Cantons; in both\r\nof which, extent of territory and population are nearly the same; and\r\nyet the revenues of the former are five times as large as those of the\r\nlatter; nor could any efforts of taxation bring them to any thing like\r\na level. In both cases, the advantages for agriculture are superior\r\nin those countries which afford least revenue in proportion. I have\r\nselected these examples because they are most familiar; but whoever\r\nwill extend the comparison between the nations of the world, will\r\nperceive that the position I have laid down is supported by universal\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, the ability of a country to pay taxes depends on\r\ninfinite combinations of physical and moral causes, which can never\r\nbe accommodated to any general rule; climate, soil, productions,\r\nadvantages for navigation, government, genius of the people, progress\r\nof arts and industry, and an endless variety of circumstances. The\r\ndiversities are sufficiently great, in these States, to make an\r\ninfinite difference in their relative wealth; the proportion of which\r\ncan never be found by any common measure whatever.\r\n\r\nThe only possible way, then, of making them contribute to the general\r\nexpense, in an equal proportion to their means, is by general taxes\r\nimposed under Continental authority.\r\n\r\nIn this mode, there would, no doubt, be inequalities, and, for a\r\nconsiderable time, material ones; but experience, and the constant\r\noperation of a general interest, which, by the very collision of\r\nparticular interests, must, in the main, prevail in a Continental\r\ndeliberative, would at length correct those inequalities, and balance\r\none tax that should bear hard upon one State, by another that should\r\nhave proportional weight in others. This idea, however, was not, at the\r\nperiod of framing the Confederation, and is not yet, agreeable to the\r\nspirit of the time. To futurity we must leave the discovery, how far\r\nthis spirit is wise or foolish. One thing only is now certain; that\r\nCongress, having the discretionary power of determining the quantum\r\nof money to be paid into the general treasury towards defraying the\r\ncommon expenses, have, in effect, the constitutional power of general\r\ntaxation.\r\n\r\nThe restraints upon the exercise of this power, amount to perpetuating\r\na rule for fixing the proportions, which must of necessity produce\r\ninequality, and, by refusing the Federal Government a power of specific\r\ntaxation and of collection, without substituting any other adequate\r\nmeans of coercion, do, in fact, leave the compliance with Continental\r\nrequisitions to the good will of the respective States. Inequality is\r\ninherent in the theory of the Confederation; and, in the practice, that\r\ninequality must increase in proportion to the honesty or dishonesty of\r\nthe component parts. This vice will either, in its consequences, reform\r\nthe Federal Constitution, or dissolve it.\r\n\r\nIf a general standard must be fixed, numbers were preferable to\r\nland. Modes might be devised to ascertain the former with tolerable\r\nprecision; but I am persuaded the experiment will prove, that the value\r\nof all the land in each State cannot be ascertained with any thing like\r\nexactness. Both these measures have the common disadvantage of being no\r\nequal representative of the wealth of the people; but one is much more\r\nsimple, definite, and certain than the other.\r\n\r\nI have indulged myself in these remarks, to show that I have little\r\nexpectation of success from any mode of carrying the article in\r\nquestion into execution upon equitable principles. I owe it, however,\r\nto myself, to declare, that my opposition did not arise from this\r\nsource. The Confederation has pointed out this mode; and, though I\r\nwould heartily join in a representation of the difficulties (of which\r\nevery man of sense must be sensible on examination) that occur in the\r\nexecution of the plan, to induce the States to consent to a change,\r\nyet, as this was not the disposition of a majority of Congress, I\r\nwould have assented to any mode of attempting it which was not either\r\nobviously mischievous or impracticable.\r\n\r\nThe first plan proposed, as your Excellency will see, was an actual\r\nvaluation of each State by itself. This was evidently making the\r\ninterested party judge in his own cause. Those who have seen the\r\noperation of this principle between the counties in the same State,\r\nand the districts in the same county, cannot doubt a moment that the\r\nvaluations on this plan would have been altogether unequal and unjust.\r\nWithout supposing more liberality in one State than another, the degree\r\nof care, judgment, and method, employed in the execution, would alone\r\nmake extreme differences in the results.\r\n\r\nThis mode has, also, the further inconvenience of awakening all the\r\njealousies of the several States against each other. Each would suspect\r\nthat its neighbor had favored itself, whether the partiality appeared\r\nor not. It would be impossible to silence these distrusts, and to make\r\nthe States sit down satisfied with the justice of each other. Every new\r\nrequisition for money would be a new signal for discussion and clamor;\r\nand the seeds of disunion, already sown too thick, would not be a\r\nlittle multiplied.\r\n\r\nTo guard against these evils, the plan proposes a revision by Congress;\r\nbut it is easy to be seen that such a power could not be exercised.\r\nShould any States return defective valuations, it would be difficult\r\nto find sufficient evidence to determine them such. To alter would\r\nnot be admissible; for Congress could have no data which could be\r\npresumed equivalent to those which must have governed the judgment of\r\ncommissioners under oath, or an actual view of the premises. To do\r\neither this, or to reject, would be an impeachment of the honor of the\r\nStates, which it is not probable there would be decision enough to\r\nhazard; and which, if done, could not fail to excite serious disgusts.\r\nThere is a wide difference between a single State exercising such a\r\npower over its own counties, and a Confederated Government exercising\r\nit over sovereign States which compose the Confederacy. It might also\r\nhappen, that too many States would be interested in the defective\r\nvaluations, to leave a sufficient number willing, either to alter or to\r\nreject.\r\n\r\nThese considerations prevailed to prevent the plan being adopted by a\r\nmajority.\r\n\r\nThe last plan may be less mischievous than the first; but it appears\r\nto me altogether ineffectual. The mere quantity of land granted and\r\nsurveyed, with the general species of buildings upon them, can\r\ncertainly be no criteria to determine their value. The plan does not\r\neven distinguish the improved from the unimproved land; the qualities\r\nof soil, or degrees of improvement: the quantities of the houses and\r\nother buildings, are entirely omitted. These, it seems, are to be\r\njudged of by the commissioners to be appointed by each State. But I am\r\nunable to conceive, how any commissioner can form the least estimate\r\nof these circumstances with respect even to his own State, much less\r\nwith respect to other States, which would be necessary to establish\r\na just relative value. If even there was a distinction of improved\r\nfrom unimproved land, by supposing an intrinsic value in the land, and\r\nadopting general rates, something nearer the truth might be attained;\r\nbut it must now be all conjecture and uncertainty.\r\n\r\nThe numbers of inhabitants, distinguishing white from black, are called\r\nfor. This is not only totally foreign to the Confederation, but can\r\nanswer no reasonable purpose. It has been said, that the proportion\r\nof numbers may guide and correct the estimates. An assertion, purely\r\nverbal, has no meaning. A judgment must first be formed of the value\r\nof the lands upon some principles. If this should be altered by the\r\nproportion of numbers, it is plain numbers would be substituted to land.\r\n\r\nAnother objection to this plan is, that it lets in the particular\r\ninterests of the States, to operate in the returns of the quantities of\r\nland, number of buildings, and number of inhabitants. But the principle\r\nof this objection applies less forcibly here than against the former\r\nplan.\r\n\r\nWhoever will consider the plain import of the eighth article of the\r\nConfederation, must be convinced, that it intended an _actual_ and\r\n_specific_ valuation of land, buildings, and improvements, not a mere\r\ngeneral estimate, according to the present plan. While we insist,\r\ntherefore, upon adhering to the Confederation, we should do it in\r\nreality, not barely in appearance.\r\n\r\nMany of those who voted for this scheme, had as bad an opinion of it\r\nas myself; but they were induced to accede to it, by a persuasion that\r\nsome plan for the purpose was expected by the States; and that none\r\nbetter, in the present circumstances of the country, could be fallen\r\nupon.\r\n\r\nA leading rule which I have laid down for the direction of my conduct,\r\nis this: that while I would have a just deference for the expectations\r\nof the States, I would never consent to amuse them by attempts which\r\nmust either fail in the execution, or be productive of evil. I would\r\nrather incur the negative inconveniences of delay than the positive\r\nmischiefs of injudicious expedients. A contrary conduct serves to\r\ndestroy confidence in the government, the greatest misfortune that can\r\nbefall a nation. There should, in my opinion, be a character of wisdom\r\nand efficiency in all the measures of the Federal Council, the opposite\r\nof a spirit of temporizing concession.\r\n\r\nI would have sufficient reliance on the judgments of the several\r\nStates, to hope that good reasons for not attempting a thing, would be\r\nmore satisfactory to them than precipitate and fruitless attempts.\r\n\r\nMy idea is, that, taking it for granted the States will expect an\r\nexperiment on the principle of the Confederation, the best plan will\r\nbe to make it by commissioners appointed by Congress, and acting under\r\ntheir authority. Congress might, in the first instance, appoint three\r\nor more of the principal characters in each State for probity and\r\nabilities, with a power to nominate other commissioners under them, in\r\neach subdivision of the State. General principles might be laid down\r\nfor the regulation of their conduct, by which uniformity in the manner\r\nof conducting the business would obtain. Sanctions of such solemnity\r\nmight be prescribed, and such notoriety given to every part of the\r\ntransaction, that the commissioners could neither be careless nor\r\npartial without a sacrifice of reputation.\r\n\r\nTo carry this plan, however, into effect, with sufficient care and\r\naccuracy, would be a work both of time and expense; and, unfortunately,\r\nwe are so pressed to find money for calls of immediate necessity, that\r\nwe could not, at present, undertake a measure which would require so\r\nlarge a sum.\r\n\r\nTo me it appears evident, that every part of a business which is of\r\nso important and universal concern, should be transacted on uniform\r\nprinciples, and under the direction of that _body_ which has a common\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nIn general, I regard the present moment, probably the dawn of peace,\r\nas peculiarly critical; and the measures which it shall produce, as\r\nof great importance to the future welfare of these States. I am,\r\ntherefore, scrupulously cautious of assenting to plans which appear to\r\nme founded on false principles.\r\n\r\nYour Excellency will observe, that the valuation of the lands is to be\r\nthe standard for adjusting the accounts, for past supplies, between the\r\nUnited States and the particular States. This, if adhered to, without\r\nallowance for the circumstances of those States which have been more\r\nimmediately the theatre of the war, will charge our State for the past,\r\naccording to its _future ability_, when in an entire condition, if the\r\nvaluation should be made after we regain possession of the parts of the\r\nState now in the power of the enemy.\r\n\r\nI have heretofore introduced a motion for repeating the call, in a\r\nmore earnest manner, upon the States, to vest Congress with a power of\r\nmaking equitable abatements, agreeably to the spirit of the Resolution\r\nof the twentieth of February last, which few of the States have\r\ncomplied with. This motion has been committed. I know not what will be\r\nits fate.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the opposition I have given, now the matter has been\r\ndecided in Congress, I hope the State will cheerfully comply with what\r\nis required. Unless each State is governed by this principle, there is\r\nan end of the Union. Every State will, no doubt, have a right, in this\r\ncase, to accompany its compliance with such remarks as it may think\r\nproper.\r\n\r\n                                    I have the honor to be,\r\n                                    Your Excellency’s most ob’t servant,\r\n                                    A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nP. S. After the plan was agreed upon, it was committed to be put into\r\nform; and, when reported, instead of commissioners, an alteration was\r\ncarried for making the estimate by a Grand Committee.\r\n\r\n                                                            February 27.\r\n\r\nMr. Morris has signified to Congress, his resolution to resign by the\r\nfirst of June, if adequate funds are not by that time provided. This\r\nwill be a severe stroke to our affairs. No man, fit for the office,\r\nwill be willing to supply his place, for the very reason he resigns.\r\n\r\n’Tis happy for us we have reasons to expect a peace. I am sorry that,\r\nby different accounts, it appears not to have been concluded late in\r\nDecember.\r\n\r\nTo His Excellency Governor Clinton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR CLINTON TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   Kingston, February 24, 1783.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nI have been honored by your letter of the twelfth of January. You may\r\nremember, that in July last, I submitted to the consideration of our\r\nLegislature, certain Resolutions of the Assembly of New Hampshire,\r\nmaking overtures for an amicable settlement of a boundary line between\r\nthe two States; which were read and committed: but as the session\r\nwas short, and devoted principally to the particular business for\r\nwhich they were convened, no determination was had on the subject. I\r\nhad some reason to expect a consideration of these Resolutions would\r\nhave taken place at the present meeting. This induced me to defer\r\nanswering your letter until I could inform you of the result. I cannot,\r\nhowever, discover any disposition to take up this business. It seems\r\nto be the prevailing opinion, that as Congress has engaged to make a\r\nfinal decision of the controversy respecting the district called the\r\nGrants, a partial compromise of the matter would be improper; as any\r\nmeasures for the purpose, might alienate the affections of our most\r\nzealous subjects in that quarter, and be attended with other dangerous\r\nconsequences. Besides, doubts exist whether the Legislature have\r\nauthority, by any act of theirs, to consent to such a dismemberment\r\nof the State as would probably be insisted upon, on a compromise with\r\nNew Hampshire. I am, nevertheless, still persuaded, should Congress\r\ndetermine the summit of the mountains to be the boundary between the\r\ntwo States, this State (whatever our sentiments might be of the equity\r\nof the decision) would, for the sake of peace, submit to it: and there\r\ncannot be a doubt, but that New Hampshire would be perfectly satisfied\r\nwith the jurisdiction of so extensive and valuable a territory. I take\r\nit for granted, that, whatever may be the decision, equitable measures\r\nwill be adopted for securing the property of individuals.\r\n\r\nI congratulate you, most sincerely, on the promising prospects of\r\npeace. I pray nothing may prevent the desirable event soon taking\r\nplace. Our friends from the city, and Long Island, anxiously wait for\r\nthe moment in which they may return to their homes. The expectations\r\nof all are so much raised as to obstruct public business not a little.\r\nPlease to offer my best respects to Mrs. Hamilton, and believe me,\r\n\r\n                                        With great respect and esteem,\r\n                                        Sir, your most obedient servant,\r\n                                        Geo. Clinton.\r\n\r\nP. S. It is with great concern I mention, that since writing the\r\nabove, I am informed of the death of your relation, Colonel John Van\r\nRensselaer. He departed this life on Friday last. General Schuyler, who\r\nwas sent for when his recovery was despaired of, is to set out from\r\nAlbany on his return to this place on Wednesday next.\r\n\r\n                                                                   G. C.\r\n\r\nTo Alexander Hamilton, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       Newburgh, March 4, 1783.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nI have received your favor of February, and thank you for the\r\ninformation and observations it has conveyed to me. I shall always\r\nthink myself obliged by a free communication of sentiments, and have\r\noften thought (but suppose I thought wrong, as it did not accord with\r\nthe practice of Congress), that the public interest might be benefited,\r\nif the Commander-in-Chief of the army was let more into the political\r\nand pecuniary state of our affairs than he is. Enterprises, and the\r\nadoption of military and other arrangements that might be exceedingly\r\nproper in some circumstances, would be altogether improper in others.\r\nIt follows, then, by fair deduction, that where there is a want of\r\ninformation, there must be chance-medley; and a man may be upon the\r\nbrink of a precipice before he is aware of his danger, when a little\r\nforeknowledge might enable him to avoid it. But this by the by.\r\n\r\nThe hint contained in your letter, and the knowledge I have derived\r\nfrom the public gazettes, respecting the non-payment of taxes, contain\r\nall the information I have received of the danger that stares us in the\r\nface on account of our funds; and so far was I from conceiving that\r\nour finances were in so deplorable a state, _at this time_, that I had\r\nimbibed ideas from some source or other, that, with the prospect of a\r\nloan from Holland, we should be able to rub along.\r\n\r\nTo you, who have seen the danger to which the army has been exposed\r\nto a political dissolution for want of subsistence, and the unhappy\r\nspirit of licentiousness which it imbibed by becoming, in one or two\r\ninstances, its own proveditors, no observations are necessary to\r\nevince the fatal tendency of such a measure; but I shall give it as my\r\nopinion, that it would at this day be productive of civil commotions\r\nand end in blood. Unhappy situation this! God forbid we should be\r\ninvolved in it.\r\n\r\nThe predicament in which I stand, as citizen and soldier, is as\r\ncritical and delicate as can well be conceived. It has been the subject\r\nof many contemplative hours. The sufferings of a complaining army on\r\none hand, and the inability of Congress, and tardiness of the States on\r\nthe other, are the forebodings of evil, and may be productive of events\r\nwhich are more to be deprecated than prevented: but I am not without\r\nhope, if there is such a disposition shown as prudence and policy\r\ndictate, to do justice, your apprehensions, in case of peace, are\r\ngreater than there is cause for. In this, however, I may be mistaken,\r\nif those ideas which you have been informed are propagated in the army,\r\nshould be extensive, the source of which may be easily traced; as the\r\nold leaven, _it is said_, for I have no proof of it, is again beginning\r\nto work, under the mask of the most perfect dissimulation and apparent\r\ncordiality.\r\n\r\nBe these things as they may, I shall pursue the same steady line\r\nof conduct which has governed me hitherto; fully convinced, that\r\nthe sensible and discerning part of the army cannot be unacquainted\r\n(although I never took pains to inform them) of the services I have\r\nrendered it on more occasions than one. This, and pursuing the\r\nsuggestions of your letter, which I am happy to find coincide with\r\nmy own practice for several months past, and which was the means of\r\ndirecting the business of the army into the channel it now is, leave me\r\nunder no _great_ apprehension of its exceeding the bounds of reason and\r\nmoderation; notwithstanding the prevailing sentiment in the army is,\r\nthat the prospect of compensation for past services will terminate with\r\nthe war.\r\n\r\nThe just claims of the army ought, and it is to be hoped will, have\r\ntheir weight with every sensible Legislature in the Union, if Congress\r\npoint to their demands; show (if the case is so) the reasonableness of\r\nthem; and the impracticability of complying without their aid. In any\r\nother point of view, it would, in my opinion, be impolitic to introduce\r\nthe army on the tapis, lest it should excite jealousy and bring on\r\nits concomitants. The States cannot, surely, be so devoid of common\r\nsense, common honesty, and common policy, as to refuse their aid, on\r\na full, clear, and candid representation of facts from Congress; more\r\nespecially, if these should be enforced by members of their own body,\r\nwho might demonstrate what the inevitable consequences of failure must\r\nlead to.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion it is a matter worthy of consideration, how far an\r\nadjournment of Congress for a few months is advisable. The delegates,\r\nin that case, if they are in unison themselves respecting the great\r\ndefects of their Constitution, may represent them fully and boldly to\r\ntheir constituents. To me, who know nothing of the business which is\r\nbefore Congress, nor of the arcanum, it appears that such a measure\r\nwould tend to promote the public weal: for it is clearly my opinion,\r\nunless Congress have powers competent to all _general_ purposes, that\r\nthe distresses we have encountered, the expenses we have incurred, and\r\nthe blood we have spilt, in the course of an eight years’ war, will\r\navail us nothing.\r\n\r\nThe contents of your letter is known only to myself; and your prudence\r\nwill direct what should be done with this.\r\n\r\n                                           With great esteem and regard,\r\n                                           I am, dear Sir,\r\n                                           Your most obedient servant,\r\n                                           G. Washington.\r\n\r\nTo the Hon. Alexander Hamilton, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   Philadelphia, March 5, 1783.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nI had the honor of writing to your Excellency lately on a very\r\nconfidential subject, and shall be anxious to know, as soon as\r\nconvenient, whether the letter got safe to hand.\r\n\r\nThe bearer, Shattuck, thinks he can point out means of apprehending\r\nWells and Knowlton, the two persons whom your Excellency was authorized\r\nto have taken into custody. I have desired him to call upon you to\r\ndisclose the plan.\r\n\r\nI will not trouble your Excellency with any observation on the\r\nimportance of getting hold of those persons.\r\n\r\nThe surmise that Mr. Arnold, a member of Congress, gave intelligence to\r\nthem of the design to take them, makes it peculiarly important.\r\n\r\n                                     I have the honor to be,\r\n                                     Your Excellency’s most ob’t serv’t,\r\n                                     A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo His Excellency General Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      Newburgh, March 12, 1783.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nWhen I wrote to you last, we were in a state of tranquillity; but after\r\nthe arrival of a certain gentleman, who shall be nameless at present,\r\nfrom Philadelphia, a storm very suddenly arose, with unfavorable\r\nprognostics; which, though diverted for a moment, is not yet blown\r\nover; nor is it in my power to point to the issue.\r\n\r\nThe papers which I send officially to Congress, will supersede the\r\nnecessity of my remarking on the tendency of them. The notification and\r\naddress, both, appeared at the same instant, on the day preceding the\r\nintended meeting. The first of these I got hold of the same afternoon;\r\nthe other not till next morning.\r\n\r\nThere is something very mysterious in this business. It appears reports\r\nhave been propagated in Philadelphia, that dangerous combinations were\r\nforming in the army; and this at a time when there was not a syllable\r\nof the kind in agitation in camp. It also appears, that upon the\r\narrival in camp of the gentleman above alluded to, such sentiments as\r\nthese were immediately circulated: That it was universally expected the\r\narmy would not disband until they had obtained justice; that the public\r\ncreditors looked up to them for redress of their own grievances; would\r\nafford them every aid, and even join them in the field, if necessary;\r\nthat some members of Congress wished the measure might take effect, in\r\norder to compel the public, particularly the delinquent States, to do\r\njustice; with many other suggestions of a similar nature.\r\n\r\nFrom this, and a variety of other considerations, it is firmly believed\r\nby _some_, the scheme was not only planned, but also digested and\r\nmatured, in Philadelphia;[19] but my opinion shall be suspended till\r\nI have better ground to found one on. The matter was managed with\r\ngreat art; for as soon as the minds of the officers were thought to be\r\nprepared for the transaction, the anonymous invitations and addresses\r\nto the officers were put in circulation through every State line in\r\nthe army. I was obliged, therefore, in order to arrest on the spot,\r\nthe feet that stood wavering on a tremendous precipice, to prevent the\r\nofficers from being taken by surprise, while the passions were all\r\ninflamed, and to rescue them from plunging themselves into a gulf of\r\ncivil horror from which there might be no receding, to issue the order\r\nof the eleventh.\r\n\r\nThis was done upon the principle that it is easier to divert from a\r\nwrong, and point to a right path, than it is to recall the hasty and\r\nfatal steps which have been already taken.\r\n\r\nIt is commonly supposed, if the officers had met agreeably to the\r\nanonymous summons, with their feelings all alive, resolutions might\r\nhave been formed, the consequences of which may be more easily\r\nconceived than described. Now they will have leisure to view the matter\r\nmore calmly, and will act more seriously. It is to be hoped they will\r\nbe induced to adopt more rational measures, and wait a while longer a\r\nsettlement of their accounts, the postponing of which appears to be the\r\nmost plausible, and almost the only article of which designing men can\r\nmake an improper use, by insinuating (which they really do) that it is\r\ndone with design that peace may take place, and prevent any adjustment\r\nof accounts; which, say they, would inevitably be the case, if the\r\nwar was to cease to-morrow: or, supposing the best, you would have to\r\ndance attendance at public offices, at great distances, perhaps, and\r\nequally great expenses, to obtain a settlement, which would be highly\r\ninjurious, nay, ruinous to you. This is their language.\r\n\r\nLet me beseech you, therefore, my good sir, to urge this matter\r\nearnestly, and without further delay. The situation of these gentlemen,\r\nI do verily believe, is distressing beyond description. It is affirmed\r\nto me, that a large part of them have no better prospect before them\r\nthan a jail, if they are turned loose without liquidation of accounts,\r\nand an assurance of that justice to which they are so worthily\r\nentitled. To prevail on the delegates of those States, through whose\r\nmeans these difficulties occur, it may, in my opinion, with propriety\r\nbe suggested to them, if any disastrous consequences should follow, by\r\nreason of their delinquency, that they must be answerable to God and\r\ntheir Country for the ineffable horrors which may be occasioned thereby.\r\n\r\n                                             I am, dear Sir,\r\n                                             Your most obedient servant,\r\n                                             G. Washington.\r\n\r\nP. S. I have received your letter of the fifth, and have put that\r\nmatter in train which was mentioned in it.\r\n\r\n                                                                   G. W.\r\n\r\nI am this instant informed, that a second address to the officers,\r\ndistinguished No. 2, is thrown into circulation. The contents evidently\r\nprove, that the author is in, or near, camp; and that the following\r\nwords, erased in the second page of this letter, ought not to have met\r\nwith this treatment, viz.--“By others, that it is the illegitimate\r\noffspring of a person in the army.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[19] The words, “By others, that it is the illegitimate offspring of\r\na person in the army,” which came in here, are obliterated in the\r\noriginal, but were restored by Washington in the _postscript_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  Philadelphia, March 17, 1783.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nI am duly honored with your Excellency’s letters of the fourth and\r\ntwelfth instant. It is much to be regretted, though not to be wondered\r\nat, that steps of so inflammatory a tendency have been taken in the\r\narmy. Your Excellency has, in my opinion, acted wisely. The best way\r\nis, ever, not to attempt to stem a torrent, but to divert it.\r\n\r\nI am happy to find you coincide in opinion with me on the conduct\r\nproper to be observed by yourself. I am persuaded, more and more, it\r\nis that which is most consistent with your own reputation and the\r\npublic safety. Our affairs wear a most serious aspect, as well foreign\r\nas domestic. Before this gets to hand, your Excellency will probably\r\nhave seen the provisional articles between Great Britain and these\r\nStates. It might, at first appearance, be concluded, that these will be\r\nthe prelude to a general peace; but there are strong reasons to doubt\r\nthe truth of such a conclusion. Obstacles may arise from different\r\nquarters; from the demands of Spain and Holland; from the hope, in\r\nFrance, of greater acquisitions in the East; and, perhaps, still more\r\nprobably, from the insincerity and duplicity of Lord Shelburne, whose\r\npolitics, founded in the peculiarity of his situation, as well as in\r\nthe character of the man, may well be suspected of insidiousness.\r\nI am really apprehensive, if peace does not take place, that the\r\nnegotiations will tend to sow distrust among the allies, and weaken the\r\nforce of the common league. We have, I fear, men among us, and men in\r\ntrust, who have a hankering after British connection. We have others\r\nwhose confidence in France savors of credulity. The intrigues of the\r\nformer, and the incautiousness of the latter, may be both, though in\r\ndifferent degrees, injurious to the American interests, and make it\r\ndifficult for prudent men to steer a proper course.\r\n\r\nThere are delicate circumstances, with respect to the late foreign\r\ntransactions, which I am not at liberty to reveal; but which, joined to\r\nour internal weaknesses, disorders, follies, and prejudices, make this\r\ncountry stand upon precarious ground.\r\n\r\nSome use, perhaps, may be made of these ideas, to induce moderation in\r\nthe army. An opinion that their country does not stand upon a secure\r\nfooting, will operate upon the patriotism of the officers against\r\nhazarding any domestic commotions.\r\n\r\nWhen I make these observations, I cannot forbear adding, that if\r\nno excesses take place, I shall not be sorry that ill-humors have\r\nappeared. I shall not regret importunity, if temperate, from the army.\r\n\r\nThere are good intentions in the majority of Congress, but there is\r\nnot sufficient wisdom or decision. There are dangerous prejudices, in\r\nthe particular States, opposed to those measures which alone can give\r\nstability and prosperity to the Union. There is a fatal opposition to\r\nContinental views. Necessity alone can work a reform. But how produce\r\nthat necessity, how apply it, and how keep it within salutary bounds? I\r\nfear we have been contending for a shadow.\r\n\r\nThe affair of accounts I considered as having been put on a\r\nsatisfactory footing. The particular States have been required to\r\nsettle till the first of August, ’80; and the Superintendent of Finance\r\nhas been directed to take measures for settling since that period. I\r\nshall immediately see him on the subject.\r\n\r\nWe have had eight States and a half in favor of a commutation of the\r\nhalf pay for an average of ten years’ purchase; that is, five years’\r\nfull pay instead of half pay for life, which, on a calculation of\r\nannuities, is nearly an equivalent. I hope this will now shortly take\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nWe have made considerable progress in a plan to be recommended to the\r\nseveral States for funding all the public debts, including those of\r\nthe army; which is certainly the only way to restore public credit,\r\nand enable us to continue the war by borrowing abroad, if it should be\r\nnecessary, to continue it.\r\n\r\nI omitted mentioning to your Excellency, that, from European\r\nintelligence, there is great reason to believe, at all events, peace or\r\nwar, New-York will be evacuated in the spring. It will be a pity if any\r\ndomestic disturbances should change the plans of the British Court.\r\n\r\n                                     I have the honor to be,\r\n                                     With the greatest respect,\r\n                                     Your Excellency’s most ob’t serv’t,\r\n                                     A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nP. S. Your Excellency mentions, that it has been surmised, the plan\r\nin agitation was formed in Philadelphia; that combinations have been\r\ntalked of between the public creditors and the army; and that members\r\nof Congress had encouraged the idea. This is partly true. I have myself\r\nurged, in Congress, the propriety of uniting the influence of the\r\npublic creditors, and the army, as a part of them, to prevail upon the\r\nStates to enter into their views. I have expressed the same sentiments\r\nout of doors. Several other members of Congress have done the same. The\r\nmeaning, however, of all this, was simply, that Congress should adopt\r\nsuch a plan as would embrace the relief of all the public creditors,\r\nincluding the army; in order that the personal influence of some, the\r\nconnections of others, and a sense of justice to the army, as well as\r\nthe apprehension of ill consequences, might form a mass of influence,\r\nin each State, in favor of the measures of Congress. In this view,\r\nas I mentioned to your Excellency in a former letter, I thought the\r\ndiscontents of the army might be turned to a good account. I am still\r\nof opinion, that their earnest but respectful applications for redress\r\nwill have a good effect. As to any combination of _force_, it would\r\nonly be productive of the horrors of a civil war, might end in the ruin\r\nof the country, and would certainly end in the ruin of the army.\r\n\r\n                                                                   A. H.\r\n\r\nTo His Excellency General Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  Philadelphia, March 24, 1783.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nYour Excellency will, before this reaches you, have received a letter\r\nfrom the Marquis De La Fayette, informing you, that the preliminaries\r\nof peace between all the belligerent powers have been concluded. I\r\ncongratulate your Excellency on this happy conclusion of your labors.\r\nIt now only remains to make solid establishments within, to perpetuate\r\nour Union, to prevent our being a ball in the hands of European powers,\r\nbanded against each other at their pleasure; in fine, to make our\r\nindependence truly a blessing. This, it is to be lamented, will be an\r\narduous work; for, to borrow a figure from mechanics, the centrifugal\r\nis much stronger than the centripetal force in these States; the seeds\r\nof disunion much more numerous than those of union.\r\n\r\nI will add, that your Excellency’s exertions are as essential to\r\naccomplish this end, as they have been to establish independence. I\r\nwill, upon a future occasion, open myself upon this subject.\r\n\r\nYour conduct in the affair of the officers is highly pleasing here. The\r\nmeasures of the army are such as I could have wished them, and will\r\nadd new lustre to their character, as well as strengthen the hands of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\n                                     I am, with great truth and respect,\r\n                                     Your Excellency’s\r\n                                     Most obedient servant,\r\n                                     A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nTo his Excellency General Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  Philadelphia, March 25, 1783.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nI wrote to your Excellency a day or two ago by express. Since that,\r\na committee, appointed on the communications from you, have had a\r\nmeeting, and find themselves embarrassed. They have requested me to\r\ncommunicate our embarrassments to you in confidence, and to ask your\r\nprivate opinion. The army, by their resolutions, express an expectation\r\nthat Congress will not disband them previous to a settlement of\r\naccounts, and the establishment of funds. Congress may resolve upon the\r\nfirst, but the general opinion is, that they cannot constitutionally\r\ndeclare the second. They have no right, by the Confederation, to\r\n_demand_ funds; they can only recommend: and to determine, that the\r\narmy shall be continued in service till the States grant them, would\r\nbe to determine, that the whole present army shall be a standing\r\narmy during peace, unless the States comply with the requisition for\r\nfunds. This, it is supposed, would excite the alarms and jealousies of\r\nthe States, and increase, rather than lessen, the opposition to the\r\nfunding scheme. It is also observed, that the longer the army is kept\r\ntogether, the more the payment of past dues is procrastinated; the\r\nabilities of the States being exhausted for their immediate support,\r\nand a new debt every day incurred. It is further suggested, that there\r\nis danger in keeping the army together, in a state of inactivity, and\r\nthat a separation of the several lines would facilitate the settlement\r\nof accounts, diminish present expense, and avoid the danger of union.\r\nIt is added, that the officers of each line, being on the spot, might,\r\nby their own solicitations, and those of their friends, forward the\r\nadoption of funds in the different States.\r\n\r\nA proposition will be transmitted to you by Colonel Bland, in the form\r\nof a resolution, to be adopted by Congress, framed upon the principles\r\nof the foregoing reasoning.\r\n\r\nAnother proposition is contained in the following resolution:\r\n\r\n“That the Commander-in-Chief be informed, it is the intention of\r\nCongress to effect the settlement of the accounts of the respective\r\nlines previous to their reduction; and that Congress are doing, and\r\nwill continue to do, every thing in their power towards procuring\r\nsatisfactory securities for what shall be found due on such settlement.”\r\n\r\nThe scope of this your Excellency will perceive without comment.\r\n\r\nI am to request you will favor me with your sentiments on both the\r\npropositions; and, in general, with your ideas of what had best be done\r\nwith reference to the expectation expressed by the officers; taking\r\ninto view the situation of Congress. On one side, the army expect they\r\nwill not be disbanded till accounts are settled and funds established.\r\nOn the other hand, they have no constitutional power of doing any thing\r\nmore than to recommend funds, and are persuaded that these will meet\r\nwith mountains of prejudice in some of the States.\r\n\r\nA considerable progress has been made in a plan for funding the public\r\ndebts; and it is to be hoped it will ere long go forth to the States,\r\nwith every argument that can give it success.\r\n\r\n                                                 I have the honor to be,\r\n                                                 With sincere respect,\r\n                                                 Your Excellency’s\r\n                                                 Most obedient servant,\r\n                                                 A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo his Excellency General Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  Philadelphia, March 25, 1783.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nThe inclosed I write more in a public than in a private capacity. Here\r\nI write as a citizen, zealous for the true happiness of this country;\r\nas a soldier who feels what is due to an army which has suffered every\r\nthing, and done much for the safety of America.\r\n\r\nI sincerely wish _ingratitude_ was not so natural to the human heart\r\nas it is. I sincerely wish there were no seeds of it in those who\r\ndirect the councils of the United States. But while I urge the army to\r\nmoderation, and advise your Excellency to take the direction of their\r\ndiscontents, and endeavor to confine them within the bounds of duty,\r\nI cannot, as an honest man, conceal from you, that I am afraid their\r\ndistrusts have too much foundation. Republican jealousy has in it a\r\nprinciple of hostility to an army, whatever be their merits, whatever\r\nbe their claims to the gratitude of the community. It acknowledges\r\ntheir services with unwillingness, and rewards them with reluctance.\r\nI see this temper, though smothered with great care, involuntarily\r\nbreaking out upon too many occasions. I often feel a mortification,\r\nwhich it would be impolitic to express, that sets my passions at\r\nvariance with my reason. Too many, I perceive, if they could do it with\r\nsafety or color, would be glad to elude the just pretensions of the\r\narmy. I hope this is not the prevailing disposition.\r\n\r\nBut supposing the country ungrateful, what can the army do? It must\r\nsubmit to its hard fate. To seek redress by its arms would end in its\r\nruin. The army would moulder by its own weight, and for want of the\r\nmeans of keeping together: the soldiery would abandon their officers:\r\nthere would be no chance of success, without having recourse to means\r\nthat would reverse our revolution. I make these observations, not that\r\nI imagine your Excellency can want motives to continue your influence\r\nin the path of moderation; but merely to show why I cannot, myself,\r\nenter into the views of coercion which some gentlemen entertain. For I\r\nconfess, could force avail, I should almost wish to see it employed.\r\nI have an indifferent opinion of the honesty of this country, and ill\r\nforebodings as to its future system.\r\n\r\nYour Excellency will perceive I have written with sensations of\r\nchagrin, and will make allowance for coloring: but the general picture\r\nis too true. God send us all more wisdom.\r\n\r\n                                        I am, with very sincere respect,\r\n                                        Your Excellency’s\r\n                                        Obedient servant,\r\n                                        A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nTo his Excellency General Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      Newburgh, March 31, 1783.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nI have duly received your favors of the seventeenth and twenty-fourth\r\nultimo. I rejoice, most exceedingly, that there is an end to our\r\nwarfare; and that such a field is opening to our view, as will, with\r\nwisdom to direct the cultivation of it, make us a great, a respectable,\r\nand happy people: but it must be improved by other means than State\r\npolitics and unreasonable jealousies and prejudices; or (it requires\r\nnot the second sight to see that) we shall be instruments in the hands\r\nof our enemies, and those European powers who may be jealous of our\r\ngreatness in union, to dissolve the Confederation. But to attain this,\r\nalthough the way seems extremely plain, is not so easy.\r\n\r\nMy wish to see the union of these States established upon liberal and\r\npermanent principles, and inclination to contribute my mite in pointing\r\nout the defects of the present constitution, are equally great. All\r\nmy private letters have teemed with these sentiments; and whenever\r\nthis topic has been the subject of conversation, I have endeavored to\r\ndiffuse and enforce them; but how far any further essay, by me, might\r\nbe productive of the wished for end, or appear to arrogate more than\r\nbelongs to me, depends so much upon popular opinion, and the temper\r\nand disposition of people, that it is not easy to decide. I shall be\r\nobliged to you, however, for the thoughts which you have promised me on\r\nthis subject, and as soon as you can make it convenient.\r\n\r\nNo man in the United States, is, or can be, more deeply impressed with\r\nthe necessity of a reform in our present Confederation, than myself; no\r\nman, perhaps, has felt the bad effects of it more sensibly: for, to the\r\ndefects thereof; and want of powers in Congress, may justly be ascribed\r\nthe prolongation of the war, and, consequently, the expenses occasioned\r\nby it. More than half the perplexities I have experienced in the course\r\nof my command, and almost the whole of the difficulties and distress of\r\nthe army, have their origin here: but still, the prejudices of some,\r\nthe designs of others, and the mere machinery of the majority, make\r\naddress and management necessary, to give weight to opinions which are\r\nto combat the doctrines of these different classes of men, in the field\r\nof politics.\r\n\r\nI would have been more full on this subject, but the bearer (in the\r\nclothing department) is waiting. I wish you may understand what I have\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\n                                             I am, dear Sir,\r\n                                             Your most obedient servant,\r\n                                             G. Washington.\r\n\r\nTo the Hon. Alexander Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       Newburgh, April 4, 1783.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nThe same post which gave me your two letters of the twenty-fifth of\r\nMarch, handed me one from Colonel Bland on the same point.\r\n\r\nObserving that both have been written at the desire of a committee\r\nof which you are both members, I have made a very full reply to\r\ntheir subject in my letter which is addressed to Colonel Bland; and,\r\nsupposing it unnecessary to enter into a complete detail to both, I\r\nmust beg leave to refer you to Colonel Bland’s (a sight of which I\r\nhave desired him to give you), for a full explanation of my ideas and\r\nsentiments.\r\n\r\nI read your private letter of the twenty-fifth with pain, and\r\ncontemplated the picture it had drawn with astonishment and horror:\r\nbut I will yet hope for the best. The idea of redress, by force, is\r\ntoo chimerical to have had a place in the imagination of any serious\r\nmind in this army; but there is no telling what unhappy disturbances\r\nmay result from distress, and distrust of justice: and as the fears\r\nand jealousies of the army are alive, I hope no resolution will be\r\ncome to, for disbanding or separating the lines, till the accounts\r\nare liquidated. You may rely upon it, sir, that unhappy consequences\r\nwould follow the attempt. The suspicions of the officers are afloat,\r\nnotwithstanding the resolutions which have passed on both sides. Any\r\nact, therefore, which can be construed into an attempt to separate them\r\nbefore the accounts are settled, will convey the most unfavorable ideas\r\nof the rectitude of Congress: whether well or ill founded, matters not;\r\nthe consequences will be the same.\r\n\r\nI will now, in strict confidence, mention a matter which may be\r\nuseful for you to be informed of. It is, that some men (and leading\r\nones, too) in this army, are beginning to entertain suspicions that\r\nCongress, or some members of it, regardless of the past sufferings\r\nand present distress, maugre the justice which is due to them, and\r\nthe returns which a grateful people should make to men who certainly\r\nhave contributed, more than any other class, to the establishment\r\nof Independency, are to be made use of as mere puppets to establish\r\nContinental funds; and that, rather than not succeed in this measure,\r\nor weaken their ground, they would make a sacrifice of the army and all\r\nits interests.\r\n\r\nI have two reasons for mentioning this matter to you: the one is, that\r\nthe army (considering the irritable state it is in, its sufferings,\r\nand composition) is a dangerous instrument to play with; the other,\r\nthat every possible means, consistent with their own views (which\r\ncertainly are moderate), should be essayed to get it disbanded without\r\ndelay. I might add a third: it is, that the Financier is suspected to\r\nbe at the bottom of this scheme. If sentiments of this sort should\r\nbecome general, their operation will be opposed to this plan, at the\r\nsame time that it would increase the present discontents. Upon the\r\nwhole, disband the army as soon as possible, but consult the wishes of\r\nit, which really are moderate in the mode, and perfectly compatible\r\nwith the honor, dignity, and justice, which is due from the country to\r\nit.\r\n\r\n                                   I am, with great esteem and regard,\r\n                                   Dear Sir, your most obedient servant,\r\n                                   G. Washington.\r\n\r\nTo the Hon. Alexander Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                         April 11, 1783.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nI have received your Excellency’s letters of the thirty-first of March,\r\nand fourth of April; the last to-day. The one to Colonel Bland, as\r\nmember of the committee, has been read in committee confidentially,\r\nand gave great satisfaction. The idea of not attempting to separate\r\nthe army before the settlement of accounts, corresponds with my\r\nproposition. That of endeavoring to let them have some pay, had\r\nalso appeared to me indispensable. The expectations of the army, as\r\nrepresented by your Excellency, are moderation itself. To-morrow we\r\nconfer with the Superintendent of Finance on the subject of money.\r\nThere will be difficulty, but not, we hope, insurmountable.\r\n\r\nI thank your Excellency for the hints you are so obliging as to give\r\nme in your private letter. I do not wonder at the suspicions that\r\nhave been infused; nor should I be surprised to hear, that I have\r\nbeen pointed out as one of the persons concerned in playing the game\r\ndescribed. But facts must speak for themselves. The gentlemen who were\r\nhere from the army, General McDougal, who is still here, will be able\r\nto give a true account of those who have supported the just claims of\r\nthe army, and of those who have endeavored to elude them.\r\n\r\nThere are two classes of men, sir, in Congress, of very different\r\nviews: one attached to State, the other to Continental politics. The\r\nlast have been strenuous advocates for funding the public debt upon\r\nsolid securities; the former have given every opposition in their\r\npower; and have only been dragged into the measures which are now near\r\nbeing adopted, by the clamors of the army and other public creditors.\r\n\r\nThe advocates for Continental funds, have blended the interests of\r\nthe army with other creditors, from a conviction, that no funds, for\r\npartial purposes, will go through those States to whose citizens the\r\nUnited States are largely indebted; or if they should be carried\r\nthrough, from impressions of the moment, would have the necessary\r\nstability: for the influence of those unprovided for, would always\r\nmilitate against a provision for others, in exclusion of them. It is in\r\nvain to tell men, who have parted with a large part of their property\r\non the public faith, that the services of the army are entitled to a\r\npreference: they would reason from their interest and their feelings:\r\nthese would tell them, that they had as great a title as any other\r\nclass of the community to public justice; and that while this was\r\ndenied to them, it would be unreasonable to make them bear their part\r\nof a burthen for the benefit of others. This is the way they would\r\nreason; and as their influence in some of the States was considerable,\r\nthey would have been able to prevent any partial provision.\r\n\r\nBut the question was not merely how to do justice to the creditors, but\r\nhow to restore public credit. Taxation, in this country, it was found,\r\nwould not supply a sixth part of the public necessities. The loans\r\nin Europe were far short of the balance, and the prospect every day\r\ndiminishing; the Court of France telling us, in plain terms, she could\r\nnot even do as much as she had done; individuals in Holland, and every\r\nwhere else, refusing to part with their money, on the precarious tenure\r\nof the mere faith of this country, without any pledge for the payment\r\neither of principal or interest.\r\n\r\nIn this situation what was to be done? It was essential to our cause,\r\nthat vigorous efforts should be made to restore public credit; it was\r\nnecessary to combine all the motives to this end, that could operate\r\nupon different descriptions of persons in the different States: the\r\nnecessities and discontents of the army presented themselves as a\r\npowerful engine.\r\n\r\nBut, sir, these gentlemen would be puzzled to support their\r\ninsinuations by a single fact. It was, indeed, proposed to appropriate\r\nthe intended impost on trade to the army debt; and, what was\r\nextraordinary, by gentlemen who had expressed their dislike to the\r\nprinciple of the fund. I acknowledge I was one that opposed this, for\r\nthe reasons already assigned, and for these additional ones: _That_ was\r\nthe fund on which we most counted; to obtain further loans in Europe,\r\nit was necessary we should have a fund sufficient to pay the interest\r\nof what had been borrowed, and what was to be borrowed. The truth was,\r\nthese people, in this instance, wanted to play off the army against the\r\nfunding system.\r\n\r\nAs to Mr. Morris, I will give your Excellency a true explanation of\r\nhis conduct. He had been for some time pressing Congress to endeavor\r\nto obtain funds, and had found a great backwardness in the business.\r\nHe found the taxes unproductive in the different States; he found the\r\nloans, in Europe, making a very slow progress; he found himself pressed\r\non all hands for supplies; he found himself, in short, reduced to this\r\nalternative, either of making engagements which he could not fulfil,\r\nor declaring his resignation in case funds were not established by a\r\ngiven time. Had he followed the first course, the bubble must soon\r\nhave burst; he must have sacrificed his credit and his character: and\r\npublic credit, already in a ruinous condition, would have lost its last\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nHe wisely judged it better to resign: this might increase the\r\nembarrassments of the moment; but the necessity of the case, it was to\r\nbe hoped, would produce the proper measures; and he might then resume\r\nthe direction of the machine with advantage and success.\r\n\r\nHe also had some hope that his resignation would prove a stimulus to\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nHe was, however, ill advised in the publication of his letters of\r\nresignation. This was an imprudent step, and has given a handle to his\r\npersonal enemies, who, by playing upon the passions of others, have\r\ndrawn some well-meaning men into the cry against him. But Mr. Morris\r\ncertainly deserves a great deal from his country. I believe no man in\r\nthis country, but himself, could have kept the money machine agoing\r\nduring the period he has been in office. From every thing that appears,\r\nhis administration has been upright as well as able.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, the old leaven of Deane and Lee, is, at this day, working\r\nagainst Mr. Morris. He happened, in that dispute, to have been on the\r\nside of Deane; and certain men can never forgive him. A man whom I once\r\nesteemed, and whom I will rather suppose _duped_ than wicked, is the\r\nsecond actor in this business.\r\n\r\nThe matter, with respect to the army, which has occasioned most\r\naltercation in Congress, and most dissatisfaction in the army, has\r\nbeen the half pay. The opinions on this head have been two: one party\r\nwas for referring the several lines to their States, to make such\r\ncommutation as they should think proper; the other, for making the\r\ncommutation by Congress, and funding it on Continental security. I was\r\nof this last opinion; and so were all those who will be represented as\r\nhaving made use of the army as puppets. Our principal reasons were,\r\n_Firstly_: By referring the lines to their respective States, those\r\nwhich were opposed to the half pay, would have taken advantage of\r\nthe officers’ necessities, to make the commutation far short of an\r\nequivalent. _Secondly_: The inequality which would have arisen in the\r\ndifferent States when the officers came to compare (as has happened in\r\nother cases), would have been a new source of discontent. _Thirdly_:\r\nSuch a reference was a continuance of the old wretched State system,\r\nby which the ties between Congress and the army have been nearly\r\ndissolved; by which the resources of the States have been diverted from\r\nthe common treasury, and wasted; a system which your Excellency has\r\noften justly reprobated.\r\n\r\nI have gone to these details, to give you a just idea of the parties\r\nin Congress. I assure you, upon my honor, sir, I have given you a\r\ncandid state of facts, to the best of my judgment. The men against\r\nwhom the suspicions you mention must be directed, are, in general,\r\nthe most sensible, the most liberal, the most independent, and\r\nthe most respectable characters in our body, as well as the most\r\nunequivocal friends to the army. In a word, they are the men who think\r\ncontinentally.\r\n\r\n                                        I have the honor to be,\r\n                                        With sincere respect and esteem,\r\n                                        Your Excellency’s\r\n                                        Most obedient servant,\r\n                                        A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nP. S. I am chairman of a committee for peace arrangements. We shall\r\nask your Excellency’s opinion at large, on a proper military peace\r\nestablishment. I will just hint to your Excellency, that our prejudices\r\nwill make us wish to keep up as few troops as possible.\r\n\r\nWe this moment learn, an officer is arrived from Sir Guy Carleton with\r\ndispatches; probably official accounts of peace.\r\n\r\n                                                                   A. H.\r\n\r\nTo His Excellency General Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  Philadelphia, April 15, 1783.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nThere are two resolutions passed relative to the restoration of the\r\nBritish prisoners, and to making arrangements for the surrender of the\r\nposts in the possession of the British troops; the first of which\r\nis to be transacted by you in conjunction with the Secretary at War;\r\nthe latter by yourself alone. I will explain to you some doubts which\r\nhave arisen in Congress, with regard to the true construction of the\r\nprovisional treaty; which may be of use to you in transacting the\r\nbusiness above-mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe sixth article declares, that there shall be no future\r\nconfiscations, etc., after the _ratification of the Treaty in America_;\r\nand the seventh article makes the surrender of prisoners, evacuation of\r\nposts, cessation of hostilities, etc., to depend on that event, to wit,\r\n_the ratification of the treaty in America_.\r\n\r\nNow the doubt is, whether _the treaty_ means the provisional treaty\r\n_already concluded_, or the _definitive_ treaty _to be concluded_. The\r\nlast construction is most agreeable to the letter of the provisional\r\narticles; the former, most agreeable to the usual practice of nations:\r\nfor hostilities commonly cease on the ratification of the preliminary\r\ntreaty.\r\n\r\nThere is a great diversity of opinion in Congress. It will be, in my\r\nopinion, advisable, at the same time that we do not communicate our\r\ndoubts to the British, to extract their sense of the matter from them.\r\n\r\nThis may be done by asking them, at what periods they are willing to\r\nstipulate the surrender of posts; at the same time that they are asked,\r\nin what manner it will be the most convenient to them to receive the\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\nIf they postpone the evacuation of the different posts to the\r\ndefinitive treaty, we shall then be justified in doing the same\r\nwith respect to prisoners. The question will then arise, Whether,\r\non principles of humanity, economy, and liberality, we ought not to\r\nrestore the prisoners, at all events, without delay? Much may be\r\nsaid on both sides. I doubt the expedience of a total restoration of\r\nprisoners, till they are willing to fix the epochs at which they will\r\ntake leave of us. It will add considerably to their strength; and\r\naccidents, though improbable, may happen.\r\n\r\nI confess, however, I am not clear in my opinion.\r\n\r\n                                                 I have the honor to be,\r\n                                                 Your Excellency’s\r\n                                                 Most obedient servant,\r\n                                                 A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nP.S. The provisional or preliminary treaty, is ratified by us--for the\r\ngreater caution.\r\n\r\n                                                                   A. H.\r\n\r\nTo His Excellency General Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      Newborgh, April 16, 1783.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nMy last letter to you was written in a hurry, when I was fatigued by\r\nthe more public, yet confidential, letter, which (with several others)\r\naccompanied it. Possibly, I did not, on that occasion, express myself\r\n(in what I intended as a hint) with so much perspicuity as I ought:\r\npossibly, too, what I then dropped, might have conveyed more than\r\nI intended; for I do not, at this time, recollect the force of my\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\nMy meaning, however, was only to inform, that there were different\r\nsentiments in the army, as well as in Congress, respecting Continental\r\nand State funds: some wishing to be thrown upon their respective\r\nStates, rather than the Continent at large, for payment; and that,\r\nif an idea should prevail, generally, that Congress, or part of its\r\nmembers, or ministers, bent upon the latter, should _delay_ doing\r\nthem justice, or _hazard_ it in pursuit of their favorite object; it\r\nmight create such divisions in the army, as would weaken, rather than\r\nstrengthen, the hands of those who were disposed to support Continental\r\nmeasures; and might _tend_ to defeat the end they themselves had in\r\nview by endeavoring to involve the army.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons I said, or meant to say, the army was a dangerous\r\nengine to work with, as it might be made to cut both ways; and,\r\nconsidering the sufferings of it, would, more than probably, throw its\r\nweight into that scale which seemed most likely to preponderate towards\r\nits immediate relief, without looking forward (under the pressure of\r\npresent wants) to future consequences with the eyes of politicians. In\r\nthis light, also, I meant to apply my observations to Mr. Morris, to\r\nwhom, or rather to Mr. G---- M----, is ascribed, in a great degree, the\r\ngroundwork of the superstructure which was intended to be raised in the\r\narmy by the anonymous addresses.\r\n\r\nThat no man can be more opposed to State funds and local prejudices\r\nthan myself, the whole tenor of my conduct has been one continual\r\nevidence of. No man, perhaps, has had better opportunities to _see_,\r\nand to _feel_, the pernicious tendency of the latter than I have; and\r\nI endeavor (I hope not altogether ineffectually) to inculcate them\r\nupon the officers of the army, upon all proper occasions: but their\r\nfeelings are to be attended to and soothed; and they assured, that if\r\nContinental funds cannot be established, they will be recommended to\r\ntheir respective States for payment. Justice must be done them.\r\n\r\nI should do injustice to reports, and what I believe to be the opinion\r\nof the army, were I not to inform you, that they consider you as a\r\nfriend, zealous to serve them, and one who has espoused their interests\r\nin Congress, upon every proper occasion. It is to be wished, as I\r\nobserved in my letter to Colonel Bland, that Congress would send\r\na committee to the army with plenipotentiary powers. The matters\r\nrequested of me, in your letter of the    , as chairman of a committee,\r\nand many other things, might then be brought to a close, with more\r\ndespatch, and in a happier manner, than it is likely they will be by\r\nan intercourse of letters at the distance of one hundred and fifty\r\nmiles: which takes _our_ Expresses, a week, _at least_, to go and come.\r\nAt this moment, being without any instructions from Congress, I am\r\nunder great embarrassment with respect to the soldiers for the war;\r\nand shall be obliged, more than probably, from the necessity of the\r\ncase, to exercise my own judgment without waiting for orders, as to the\r\ndischarge of them. If I should adopt measures which events may approve,\r\nall will be well. If otherwise, Why and by what authority did you do so?\r\n\r\nHow far a _strong_ recommendation from Congress, to observe _all_\r\nthe Articles of Peace, as well as the    , may imply a suspicion of good\r\nfaith in the people of this country, I pretend not to judge: but I am\r\nmuch mistaken, if something of the kind will not be found wanting; as\r\nI already perceive a disposition to carp at, and to elude, such parts\r\nof the treaty as affect their different interests; although you do not\r\nfind a man, who, when pushed, will not acknowledge, that, upon the\r\n_whole_, it is a more advantageous Peace than we could possibly have\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\n                                           I am, dear Sir,\r\n                                           With great esteem and regard,\r\n                                           Your most obedient servant,\r\n                                           G. Washington.\r\n\r\nTo the Hon. Alexander Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      Newburgh, April 22, 1783.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nI did not receive your letter of the fifteenth, till after my return\r\nfrom Ringwood, where I had a meeting with the Secretary at War, for\r\nthe purpose of making arrangements for the release of our prisoners,\r\nagreeably to the resolve of Congress of the fifteenth instant.\r\n\r\nFinding a diversity of opinion respecting the treaty, and the line\r\nof conduct we ought to observe with the prisoners, I requested, in\r\nprecise terms, to know from General Lincoln (before I entered on the\r\nbusiness), whether we were to exercise our own judgment with respect\r\nto the _time_, as well as the _mode_, of releasing them; or were to be\r\nconfined to the latter: being informed that we had no option in the\r\nfirst, Congress wishing to be eased of the expense as soon as possible,\r\nI acted _solely_ on that ground.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, I scruple not to confess to you, that if this measure\r\nwas not dictated by necessity, it is, in my opinion, an impolitic\r\none; as we place ourselves in the power of the British, before the\r\ntreaty is definitive. The manner in which Peace was first announced,\r\nand the subsequent declarations of it, have led the country and army\r\ninto a belief, that it was final. The ratification of the preliminary\r\narticles, on the third of February, so far confirmed this, that one\r\nconsequence resulting from it, is, the soldiers for the war, conceive\r\nthe term of their services has actually expired; and I believe it is\r\nnot in the power of Congress, or their officers, to hold them much,\r\nif any, longer; for we are obliged, at this moment, to increase our\r\nguards, to prevent rioting, and the insults which the officers meet\r\nwith, in attempting to hold them to their duty. The proportion of\r\nthese men, amount to seven-elevenths of this army: these we shall lose\r\nat the moment the British army will receive, by their prisoners, an\r\naugmentation of five or six thousand men.\r\n\r\nIt is not for me to investigate the causes which induced this measure;\r\nnor the policy of those letters (from authority) which gave the _ton_\r\nto the present sentiment; but since they have been adopted, we ought,\r\nin my opinion, to put a good face upon matters; and, by a liberal\r\nconduct throughout, on our part (freed from appearances of distrust)\r\ntry if we cannot excite similar dispositions on theirs. Indeed,\r\ncircumstanced as things _now_ are, I wish, most fervently, that all\r\nthe troops which are not retained for a Peace Establishment, were\r\nto be discharged immediately, or such of them, at least, as do not\r\nincline to await the settlement of their accounts. If they continue\r\nhere, their claims, I can plainly perceive, will increase; and our\r\nperplexities multiply. A petition is this moment handed to me, from the\r\nnon-commissioned officers of the Connecticut line, soliciting half pay.\r\nIt is well drawn, I am told, but I did not read it. I sent it back,\r\nwithout appearing to understand the contents, because it did not come\r\nthrough the channel of their officers. This may be followed by others:\r\nand I mention it, to show the necessity, the absolute necessity, of\r\ndischarging the _Warsmen_ as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nI have taken much pains to support Mr. Morris’s administration in the\r\narmy; and, in proportion to its numbers, I believe he had not more\r\nfriends any where: but if he will neither adopt the mode which has\r\nbeen suggested, point out any other, nor show cause why the first is\r\neither impracticable or impolitic (I have heard he objects to it),\r\nthey will certainly attribute their disappointment to a lukewarmness\r\nin him, or some design incompatible with their interests. And here, my\r\ndear Colonel Hamilton, let me assure you, that it would not be more\r\ndifficult to still the raging billows in a tempestuous gale, than to\r\nconvince the officers of this army, of the justice, or policy, of\r\npaying men, in civil offices, full wages, when _they_ cannot obtain a\r\nsixtieth part of their dues.\r\n\r\nI am not unapprised of the arguments which are made use of, upon this\r\noccasion, to discriminate the cases: but they really are futile; and\r\nmay be summed up in this: that though both are contending for the same\r\nrights, and expect equal benefits, yet, both cannot submit to the same\r\ninconveniences to obtain them: otherwise, to adopt the language of\r\nsimplicity and plainness, a ration of salt pork, with or without pease,\r\nas the case often is, would support the one as well as the other; and,\r\nin such a struggle as ours, would, in my opinion, be alike honorable in\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nMy anxiety to get home, increases with the prospect of it. But when\r\nis it to happen? I have not heard that Congress have yet had under\r\nconsideration, the lands, and other gratuities, which, at different\r\nperiods of the war, have been promised to the army. Do not these things\r\nevince the necessity of a committee’s repairing to camp, in order to\r\narrange and adjust matters without spending time in a tedious exchange\r\nof letters? Unless something of this kind is adopted, business will\r\nbe delayed, and expenses accumulated; or the army will break up in\r\ndisorder, go home enraged, complaining of injustice, and committing\r\nenormities on the innocent inhabitants in every direction.\r\n\r\nI write to you unreservedly. If, therefore, contrary to my\r\napprehension, all these matters are in a proper train, and Mr. Morris\r\nhas devised means to give the army three months’ pay, you will, I am\r\npersuaded, excuse my precipitancy and solicitude, by ascribing it to\r\nan earnest wish to see the war happily and honorably terminated; to\r\nmy anxious desire of enjoying some repose; and the necessity of my\r\npaying a little attention to my private concerns, which have suffered\r\nconsiderably in eight years’ absence.\r\n\r\nM’Henry, expressing, in a letter I have lately received from him, a\r\nwish to be appointed official Secretary to the Court of Versailles, or\r\nLondon, I have, by this opportunity, written to Mr. Livingston, and Mr.\r\nMadison, speaking of him in warm terms; and wish him success with all\r\nmy heart.\r\n\r\n                                           I am, dear Sir,\r\n                                           With great esteem and regard,\r\n                                           Your most obedient servant,\r\n                                           G. Washington.\r\n\r\nColonel Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO GOV. CLINTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    Philadelphia, May 14, 1783.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nThe President of Congress will of course have transmitted to your\r\nExcellency, the plan lately adopted by Congress for funding the public\r\ndebt. This plan was framed to accommodate it to the objections of\r\nsome of the States; but this spirit of accommodation will only serve\r\nto render it less efficient, without making it more palatable. The\r\nopposition of the State of Rhode Island, for instance, is chiefly\r\nfounded upon these two considerations: the merchants are opposed to any\r\nrevenue from trade; and the State, depending almost wholly on commerce,\r\nwants to have credit for the amount of the duties.\r\n\r\nPersuaded that the plan now proposed will have little more chance of\r\nsuccess than a better one; and that, if agreed to by all the States,\r\nit will, in a great measure, fail in the execution, it received my\r\nnegative. My principal objections were,\r\n\r\n_Firstly_: That it does not designate the funds (except the impost)\r\non which the whole interest is to arise; and by which (selecting\r\nthe capital articles of visible property) the collection would have\r\nbeen easy, the funds productive, and necessarily increasing with the\r\nincrease of the country.\r\n\r\n_Secondly_: That the duration of the funds is not coextensive with\r\nthe debt, but limited to twenty-five years; though there is a moral\r\ncertainty, that, in that period, the principal will not, by the present\r\nprovision, be fairly extinguished.\r\n\r\n_Thirdly_: That the nomination and appointment of the collectors of\r\nthe revenue are to reside in each State, instead of, at least the\r\nnomination, being in the United States; the consequence of which will\r\nbe, that those States which have little interest in the funds, by\r\nhaving a small share of the public debt due to their own citizens, will\r\ntake care to appoint such persons as are least likely to collect the\r\nrevenue.\r\n\r\nThe evils resulting from these defects, will be, that in many instances\r\nthe objects of the revenues will be improperly chosen, and will consist\r\nof a multitude of little articles, which will, on experiment, prove\r\ninsufficient; that for want of a vigorous collection in each State, the\r\nrevenue will be unproductive in many, and will fall chiefly upon those\r\nStates which are governed by most liberal principles; that for want of\r\nan adequate security, the evidences of the public debt, will not be\r\ntransferable for any thing like their value; that this not admitting\r\nan incorporation of the creditors in the nature of Banks, will deprive\r\nthe public of the benefit of an increased circulation, and of course\r\nwill disable the people from paying the taxes for want of a sufficient\r\nmedium.\r\n\r\nI shall be happy to be mistaken in my apprehensions; but the experiment\r\nmust determine.\r\n\r\nI hope our State will consent to the plan proposed; because it is her\r\ninterest, at all events, to promote the payment of the public debt on\r\nContinental funds (independent of the general considerations of union\r\nand propriety).\r\n\r\nI am much mistaken if the debts due from the United States to the\r\ncitizens of the State of New-York, do not considerably exceed its\r\nproportion of the necessary funds: of course it has an immediate\r\ninterest that there should be a Continental provision for them. But\r\nthere are superior motives that ought to operate in every State; the\r\nobligations of national faith, honor, and reputation.\r\n\r\nIndividuals have been already too long sacrificed to public\r\nconvenience. It will be shocking, and indeed an eternal reproach to\r\nthis country, if we begin the peaceable enjoyment of our independence\r\nby a violation of all the principles of honesty and true policy.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark, that at least four-fifths of the domestic debt,\r\nare due to the citizens of the States (from Pennsylvania inclusively)\r\nnorthward.\r\n\r\n                                            I have the honor to be, Sir,\r\n                                            Your most obedient servant,\r\n                                            A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nP. S. It is particularly interesting that the State should have a\r\nrepresentation here. Not only many matters are depending which require\r\na full representation in Congress (and there is now a thin one), but\r\nthose matters are of a nature so particularly interesting to our State,\r\nthat we ought not to be without a voice in them. I wish two other\r\ngentlemen of the delegation may appear as soon as possible; for it\r\nwould be very injurious for me to remain much longer here. Having no\r\nfuture views in public life, I owe it to myself, without delay to enter\r\nupon the care of my private concerns in earnest.\r\n\r\n                                                                   A. H.\r\n\r\nTo His Excellency Governor Clinton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO GOVERNOR CLINTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    Philadelphia, June 1, 1783.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nIn my last letter to your Excellency, I took occasion to mention,\r\nthat it was of great importance to the State, at this time, to have a\r\nrepresentation here, as points in which, by its present situation, it\r\nis particularly interested, are daily, and will be daily, agitated.\r\n\r\nIt is also of importance, at this moment, to the United States; (not\r\nonly from general considerations, but) because we have a very thin\r\nrepresentation in Congress, and are frequently unable to transact any\r\nof those matters which require nine States. I wish your Excellency\r\nwould urge a couple of gentlemen to come on, as it becomes highly\r\ninconvenient to me to remain here, and as I have staid the full time to\r\nbe expected.\r\n\r\nI observe, with great regret, the intemperate proceedings among the\r\npeople in different parts of the State, in violation of a treaty, the\r\nfaithful observance of which so deeply interests the United States.\r\n\r\nSurely, the State of New-York, with its capital and its frontier posts\r\n(on which its important fur trade depends) in the hands of the British\r\ntroops, ought to take care that nothing is done to furnish a pretext\r\non the other side, even for delaying, much less for refusing, the\r\nexecution of the treaty. We may imagine that the situation of Great\r\nBritain puts her under a necessity, at all events, of fulfilling her\r\nengagements, and cultivating the good will of this country.\r\n\r\nThis is, no doubt, her true policy; but when we feel that passion makes\r\nus depart from the dictates of reason; when we have seen that passion\r\nhas had so much influence in the conduct of the British Councils,\r\nin the whole course of the war; when we recollect, that those who\r\ngovern them, are men like ourselves, and alike subject to passions and\r\nresentments; when we reflect, also, that all the great men in England\r\nare not united in the liberal scheme of policy with respect to this\r\ncountry, and that in the anarchy which prevails, there is no knowing to\r\nwhom the reins of government may be committed; when we recollect how\r\nlittle in a condition we are, to enforce a compliance with our claims;\r\nwe ought, certainly, to be cautious in what manner we act, especially\r\nwhen we, in particular, have so much at stake; and should not openly\r\nprovoke a breach of faith on the other side, by setting the example.\r\n\r\nAn important distinction is not sufficiently attended to. The fifth\r\narticle is recommendatory; the sixth positive. There is no option, on\r\nthe part of the particular States, as to any future confiscations,\r\nprosecutions, or injuries of any kind, to person, liberty, or property,\r\non account of any thing done in the war. It is matter of discretion\r\nin the States, whether they will comply with the recommendations\r\ncontained in the fifth article; but no part of the sixth can be\r\ndeparted from by them, without a direct breach of public faith, and\r\nof the Confederation. The power of making treaties is exclusively\r\nlodged in Congress. That power includes whatever is essential to the\r\ntermination of the war, and to the preservation of the general safety.\r\nIndemnity to individuals in similar cases, is a _usual_ stipulation in\r\ntreaties of peace, of which many precedents are to be produced.\r\n\r\nShould it be said, that the associations of the people, without legal\r\nauthority, do not amount to a breach of the public faith; the answer\r\nis, If the government does not repress them, and prevent their having\r\neffect, it is as much a breach, as a formal refusal to comply on its\r\npart. In the eye of a foreign nation, if our engagements are broken,\r\nit is of no moment whether it is for the want of good intention in the\r\ngovernment, or for want of power to restrain its subjects.\r\n\r\nSuppose a violence committed by an American vessel on the vessel of\r\nanother nation, upon the high seas, and after complaint made there is\r\nno redress given: Is not this a hostility against the injured nation\r\nwhich will justify reprisals?\r\n\r\nBut if I am not misinformed, there are violations going on in form of\r\nlaw. I am told that indictments continue to be brought under the former\r\nconfiscation laws: A palpable infraction, if true, of the sixth article\r\nof the treaty; to which an immediate stop ought, no doubt, to be put.\r\n\r\nIt has been said by some men, that the operation of this treaty is\r\nsuspended till the definitive treaty: A plain subterfuge. Whatever\r\nis clearly expressed in the provisional or preliminary treaty, is as\r\nbinding from the moment it is made, as the definitive treaty; which, in\r\nfact, only developes, explains and fixes, more precisely, what may have\r\nbeen too generally expressed in the former.\r\n\r\nSuppose the British should now send away, not only the negroes, but\r\nall other property, and all the public records in their possession\r\nbelonging to us, on the pretence above stated: should we not justly\r\naccuse them with breaking faith? Is this not already done in the case\r\nof the negroes who have been carried away, though founded upon a very\r\ndifferent principle, a doubtful construction of the treaty, not a\r\ndenial of its immediate operation?\r\n\r\nIn fine, Is it our interest to advance this doctrine, and to\r\ncountenance the position, that nothing is binding till the definitive\r\ntreaty, when there are examples of _years_ intervening between the\r\npreliminary and definitive treaties?\r\n\r\nSir Guy Carleton, in his correspondence, has appeared to consider the\r\ntreaty as immediately obligatory: and it has been the policy which I\r\nhave pursued, to promote the same idea.\r\n\r\nI am not, indeed, apprehensive of a renewal of the war, for peace\r\nis necessary to Great Britain. I think it also most probable, her\r\ndisposition to conciliate this country will outweigh the resentments\r\nwhich a breach of our engagements is calculated to inspire. But with a\r\ntreaty which has exceeded the hopes of the most sanguine; which, in the\r\narticles of boundary and the fisheries, is even better than we asked;\r\ncircumstanced, too, as this country is, with respect to the means of\r\nmaking war; I think it the height of imprudence to run any risk. Great\r\nBritain, without recommencing hostilities, may evade parts of the\r\ntreaty. She may keep possession of the frontier posts; she may obstruct\r\nthe free enjoyment of the fisheries; she may be indisposed to such\r\nextensive concessions, in matters of commerce, as it is our interest\r\nto aim at. In all this she would find no opposition from any foreign\r\npower: and we are not in a condition to oblige her to any thing. If we\r\nimagine that France, obviously embarrassed herself, in her finances,\r\nwould renew the war to oblige Great Britain to the restoration of\r\nfrontier posts; or to a compliance with the stipulations respecting\r\nthe fisheries (especially after a manifest breach of the treaty on\r\nour part); we speculate much at random. Observations might be made\r\non the last article, which would prove, that it is not the policy of\r\nFrance to support our interest there. Are we prepared, for the mere\r\ngratification of our resentments, to put those great national objects\r\nto the hazard; to leave our western frontier in a state of insecurity;\r\nto relinquish the fur trade; and to abridge our pretensions to the\r\nfisheries? Do we think national character so light a thing, as to be\r\nwilling to sacrifice the public faith to individual animosity? Let\r\nthe case be fairly stated: Great Britain and America, two independent\r\nnations, at war. The former in possession of considerable posts and\r\ndistricts of territory, belonging to the latter; and also of the means\r\nof obstructing certain commercial advantages in which it is deeply\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\nBut it is not uncommon, in treaties of peace, for the _uti possidetis_\r\nto take place. Great Britain, however, in the present instance,\r\nstipulates to restore all our posts and territories in her possession.\r\nShe even adds an extent, not within our original claims, more than a\r\ncompensation for a small part ceded in another quarter. She agrees to\r\nre-admit us to a participation in the fisheries. What equivalent do we\r\ngive for this? Congress are to recommend the restoration of property\r\nto those who have adhered to her; and expressly engage, that no future\r\ninjury shall be done them, in person, liberty, or property. This is\r\nthe sole condition, on our part, where there is not an immediate\r\nreciprocity (the recovery of debts, and liberation of prisoners,\r\nbeing mutual; the former, indeed, only declaring what the rights of\r\nprivate faith, which all civilized nations hold sacred, would have\r\ndeclared without it), and stands as the single equivalent for all the\r\nrestitutions and concessions to be made by Great Britain. Will it be\r\nhonest in us to violate this condition, or will it be prudent to put it\r\nin competition with all the important matters to be performed on the\r\nother side?\r\n\r\nWill foreign nations be willing to undertake any thing with us, or for\r\nus, when they find that the nature of our governments will allow no\r\ndependence to be placed upon our engagements? I have omitted saying\r\nany thing of the impolicy of inducing, by our severity, a great number\r\nof useful citizens, whose situations do not make them a proper object\r\nof resentment, to abandon the country, to form settlements that will\r\nhereafter become our rivals, animated with a hatred to us, which will\r\ndescend to their posterity. Nothing, however, can be more unwise than\r\nto contribute, as we are doing, to people the shores and wilderness of\r\nNova Scotia; a colony which, by its position, will become a competitor\r\nwith us, among other things, in that branch of commerce on which our\r\nnavigation and navy will essentially depend: I mean the fisheries; in\r\nwhich, I have no doubt, the State of New-York will, hereafter, have a\r\nconsiderable share.\r\n\r\nTo your Excellency I freely deliver my sentiments, because I\r\nam persuaded you cannot be a stranger to the force of these\r\nconsiderations. I fear not even to hazard them to the justice and good\r\nsense of those whom I have the honor to represent. I esteem it my duty\r\nto do it, because the question is important to the interests of the\r\nState, in its relation to the United States.\r\n\r\nThose who consult only their passions, might choose to construe what\r\nI say, as too favorable to a set of men who have been the enemies of\r\nthe public liberty: but those for whose esteem I am most concerned,\r\nwill acquit me of any personal considerations; and will perceive that I\r\nonly urge the cause of national honor, safety, and advantage. We have\r\nassumed an independent station: we ought to feel, and to act, in a\r\nmanner consistent with the dignity of that station.\r\n\r\nI anxiously wish to see every prudent measure taken to prevent those\r\ncombinations which will certainly disgrace us, if they do not involve\r\nus in other calamities. Whatever distinctions are judged necessary to\r\nbe made, in the cases of those persons who have been in opposition\r\nto the common cause, let them be made by legal authority, on a fair\r\nconstruction of the treaty, consistent with national faith and national\r\nhonor.\r\n\r\nYour Excellency will have been informed, that Congress have instructed\r\nGeneral Washington to garrison the frontier posts, when surrendered,\r\nwith the three years’ Continental troops. This is more for the interest\r\nof the State, than to have them garrisoned at its particular expense:\r\nand I should wish that permanent provision might be made on the same\r\nprinciple. I wait to see whether any Continental peace establishment\r\nfor garrisons, etc., will take place, before I engage the consent of\r\nCongress to a separate provision.\r\n\r\nI cannot forbear adding a word on the subject of money. The only\r\nreliance we now have for redeeming a large anticipation on the public\r\ncredit, already made, and making, for the benefit of the army, is\r\non the taxes coming in. The collection, hitherto, is out of all\r\nproportion to the demand. It is of vast consequence, at this juncture,\r\nthat every thing possible should be done to forward it. I forbear\r\nentering into details which would be very striking upon this subject. I\r\nwill only say, that unless there is a serious exertion in the States,\r\npublic credit must ere long receive another shock very disagreeable in\r\nits consequences.\r\n\r\n                                                 I have the honor to be,\r\n                                                 With perfect respect,\r\n                                                 Your Excellency’s\r\n                                                 Most obedient servant,\r\n                                                 A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nTo His Excellency Governor Clinton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO REED.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                   1783.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nHaving always entertained an esteem for you personally, I could not,\r\nwithout reluctance, yield to impressions that might weaken that\r\nsentiment: and it is with pain I find myself drawn, by circumstances,\r\nto animadvert upon the late message from the Executive Council to the\r\nAssembly of Pennsylvania relative to the mutiny, in a manner which may\r\nseem to impeach the candor of those who were the authors of it.\r\n\r\nBut it will be impossible for persons who have read the report of the\r\ncommittee, and the message of the Council, however inclined to make\r\nallowances for the force of involuntary bias, not to conclude, that\r\non one side or the other, the facts have been wilfully discolored.\r\nI decline any attempt to set the public opinion right upon this\r\nsubject; because, after all that can be said, the judgments of men will\r\neventually be determined by personal and party prepossessions. So far\r\nas I am concerned, I persuade myself those who are acquainted with me,\r\nwill place entire confidence in my fairness and veracity. I doubt not\r\nyour Excellency’s friends will be equally partial to you, and those\r\nof the Council to them. But though I should despair of rectifying\r\nor fixing the public opinion, by an appeal to the public; and though\r\nI have seen too much of the ridicule thrown upon such appeals, from\r\nmen in official stations, and of the ill effect they have had upon\r\nthe national character, not to be willing to sacrifice the desire of\r\njustifying myself to considerations of prudence and propriety; yet I\r\ncannot forbear indulging my feelings so far as to enter into a few\r\nexplanations with your Excellency; submitting the justness of them to\r\nthe testimony of your own mind.\r\n\r\nAs this is a mere private discussion, I address myself to your\r\nExcellency in particular; and the rather, as, from the style and manner\r\nof the message, I take it for granted you had the principal agency in\r\nit: and I shall consider, on the same grounds, the notes in      [20]\r\npaper of the      [20], as a comment on the report of the committee by\r\nyourself; in aid of the message.\r\n\r\nI take up the matter individually, because I mean to treat it on a\r\nprivate footing; and because, though I do not acknowledge any peculiar\r\nresponsibility, it happened to be my lot, as chairman, principally to\r\nconduct the conferences on the part of the committee.\r\n\r\nI regard the whole of this business as a most unfortunate one; in\r\nwhich, probably, none of the actors will acquire great credit. I\r\ndeplore it, as tending to interrupt the harmony between Congress and\r\na respectable, a meritorious member of the Union. Who were right, or\r\nwho were wrong, is a question of less importance, than how mutual\r\nirritations may be best healed. Whatever revives, or continues, the\r\nformer, is to be regretted. I lament to be under an inducement to\r\ndiscuss circumstances that relate to it in the remotest degree. Nothing\r\nbut an attack upon the ingenuousness of my conduct, could have called\r\nme to it. Its prudence, either collectively or individually, would\r\npatiently have been consigned to the lash of censure and criticism,\r\nmerited or unmerited.\r\n\r\nHappily, in the present case, the members of the committee have a\r\nstrong ground, from which they cannot easily be forced. Apprehensive\r\nof misconception, I will not say of misrepresentation, they tried\r\nto render it impossible by written documents. The presumption, with\r\nimpartial minds, cannot fail to be in favor of that side which gave so\r\ndecisive a proof of its disposition to fairness, as to endeavor to put\r\nit out of its own power to misrepresent.\r\n\r\nThe professed scruples of the Council, cannot be admitted to have any\r\nweight. Usage, and the plainest rules of propriety, will dictate, that\r\nit never could have wounded the dignity, or delicacy, of the executive\r\nof any State, to have given to a committee of Congress, appointed\r\nto confer on a subject of moment, a written answer to a request in\r\nwriting after previous explanations. The fact stated speaks for itself.\r\nThe consequences show, that the precaution of the committee was well\r\njudged; and that it would have been well for the Council to have\r\nconcurred.\r\n\r\nIn the present case it might be observed, that there was, in the first\r\ninstance, a written application from Congress to the Council, in the\r\ncustomary form of resolutions: and though a committee was authorized to\r\nconfer and explain, a formal and authentic answer might reasonably have\r\nbeen expected by Congress; and, when desired by the committee, should\r\nhave been understood as desired on their behalf.\r\n\r\nThere is an awkwardness in reasoning upon self-evident positions; but\r\nas the Council have, by their conduct in the first instance, and by\r\ntheir message since, put forward a doubt upon the subject, and made it\r\na point of importance, I shall be excused for examining it a little\r\nfurther. On what could the objection of the Council be founded? They\r\nsay it had been unusual. Admitting the fact, was the mere novelty of\r\nthe thing a sufficient reason against it? If there was no apparent\r\ninconvenience in making a new precedent; if; on the contrary, there was\r\na manifest convenience in it; ought not such a punctilio to have given\r\nway to considerations of utility?\r\n\r\nWas it derogatory to the dignity of the Council? Surely, if they\r\ncommunicate in writing with the executive servants of Congress, even\r\nthose in subordinate stations, as is the practice of every day, and as\r\nis indispensable to the prosecution of public business, they might, at\r\nless expense of dignity, pursue the same mode with a part of that body\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThe distinction taken by the Council, in their message to the\r\nAssembly, respecting the responsibility of such executive officers,\r\nas not applicable to a committee, if it amounts to any thing, proves\r\nonly this: That such officers ought, in prudence, to take greater\r\nprecautions for their own justification than a committee of Congress\r\nneed to do. It is not to be inferred, if a committee of Congress,\r\nacting ministerially, think it expedient to use circumspection, that\r\nthose with whom they are transacting business, can, with propriety,\r\nrefuse to join with them in that mode which is best adapted to\r\nprecision and certainty.\r\n\r\nBut, indeed, the ground of distinction is erroneous. A committee of\r\nCongress act in a ministerial capacity, and are therefore responsible\r\nto the body to which they belong, as well as the servants of that\r\nbody, though in a different manner. If it be said they do not act\r\nministerially, but stand in the place of Congress; then the Council,\r\nupon their own principles, ought to have complied with their request.\r\n\r\nTo diminish the exceptionableness of their refusal, it is true,\r\nas stated by the Council, that though they said they could not\r\n_condescend_ to do what the committee had asked; yet they declared\r\nthemselves willing to _grant_ an answer in writing, if Congress should\r\nrequest it; and that they proposed, that the committee should put their\r\nverbal answer in writing, to be afterwards perused and examined by them.\r\n\r\nThe answer of the committee, as I doubt not your Excellency will\r\nrecollect, was, as to the first point, that Congress in all probability\r\nwould not make the request, having determined (as the Council had been\r\nalready informed) not to resume their deliberations in the city, till\r\neffectual measures had been taken to suppress the mutiny; and should\r\nthey assemble, would naturally feel a delicacy in requesting what had\r\nbeen denied to their committee. And as to the second point, that the\r\nCouncil having judged it inexpedient to give a written answer, the\r\ncommittee would content themselves with making the most accurate\r\nreport in their power, relying upon the confidence of the body to which\r\nthey belonged, and upon the candor of the Council.\r\n\r\nYour Excellency is too good a judge of human nature, as well as of the\r\nforce of language, not to have perceived at the time, the effect which\r\nthe refusal of the Council had upon my mind. I own it struck me, either\r\nas an uncandid reserve, or an unbecoming stateliness; and, in either\r\nsupposition, a disrespect to the body of which the committee were\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\nThough nothing enters less into my temper than an inclination to\r\nfetter business by punctilio, after the Council had discovered such\r\noverweening nicety, I should have thought it a degradation to my\r\nofficial character, to have consented to their proposal.\r\n\r\nThe desire of self-justification is so natural, that I should not have\r\nbeen surprised to have seen the transactions which are the subject of\r\nthe Council’s message, receive a coloring favorable to their purpose:\r\nbut I did not expect to find material facts either suppressed or denied.\r\n\r\nThe report made by the committee on the first interview with the\r\nCouncil, was, I acknowledge, from memory, and therefore I admit a\r\npossibility of error; but, so far as my memory can be relied on, the\r\nrepresentation was just. And I am certain that there is a mistake in\r\nthe insinuation, that the circumstance of the message sent to Congress\r\nby the Board of Sergeants, was not mentioned at all to the Council;\r\nfor I have a note of it, taken immediately after the first conference\r\nsubsequent to the mutiny. The affair, by the event of      , having\r\nassumed a more serious aspect, I kept a regular minute of the\r\nproceedings; a summary of which, made up our report to Congress, and\r\nwhich I shall annex, at large, to this letter for your Excellency’s\r\nperusal.\r\n\r\nThe message entirely omits the declaration of the Council, that\r\n\r\n ... ... ... [21];\r\n\r\nand the note says, that the Council only declared,\r\n“That they could not be sure, that such another insult would produce\r\nthose exertions.”[22] The difference in this article is of great\r\nimportance. The declaration made so deep an impression at the time,\r\nthat almost the precise words remained in my memory. They were twice\r\nrepeated, as well when we saw your Excellency alone, in your own house,\r\nin the morning, as when you delivered to us, in the Council chamber,\r\nthe determination of the Council.\r\n\r\nMr. Ellsworth[23], in half an hour afterwards, repeated them to several\r\nmembers of Congress assembled at the President’s house; and in a few\r\nhours from that time I committed them to writing. I cannot suppose your\r\nExcellency’s recollection fails you in this particular; and I must\r\npointedly appeal to your candor.\r\n\r\nTo show the inaccuracy with which the report of the committee was\r\ncomposed, it is observed, in the notes with respect to that part which\r\nrelates to the commission given by the mutineers to the officers whom\r\nthey had chosen to represent them, that only two hours had intervened\r\nbetween that event and the conference with the Council; and that it\r\nwas very improbable the knowledge of it could have so early reached\r\nthe committee. It is added, that none of the Council remembers to have\r\nheard a single syllable respecting it, during the whole conference.\r\n\r\nAs to the argument drawn from the short interval between the delivery\r\nof the commission and the conference, it will be sufficient to say,\r\nthat the committee held a constant communication with General St.\r\nClair, and that he kept a vigilant eye upon all the motions of the\r\nmutineers; that his access to them was easy; that the fact in question\r\nwas a matter of immediate notoriety; that two hours were abundant time\r\nfor a thing of that nature to be conveyed from the barracks to General\r\nSt. Clair’s quarters; and that one of the committee had actually seen,\r\nand obtained the intelligence from him, a little time before the\r\ninterview with the Council commenced.\r\n\r\nIt is much more extraordinary that the Council should have been\r\napprised of it so late, than that the committee should have known it\r\nso early. As to the memory of the Council, it is unfortunate it should\r\nhave been so fallible as it is said to have been: but I would rather\r\nsuppose, “in the quick succession of circumstances,” the matter had\r\nescaped recollection, than that my minutes, as well as my memory,\r\nshould have deceived me. I well recollect, also, that your Excellency,\r\nwhen it was mentioned, acknowledged that it rather contradicted the\r\npacific appearance which the conduct of the troops, in other respects,\r\nwore.\r\n\r\nThese are the essential differences, in point of fact, between the\r\nreport of the committee, and the message of Council: the whole\r\ncomplexion, indeed, of one, materially varies from the other; but the\r\nmost common observer must have noticed, how different an aspect the\r\nsame facts will bear, differently dressed and arranged. It was to avoid\r\nthis, we proposed to reduce them to writing: but as this has not been\r\ndone, spectators must judge, from the situation of the parties, and the\r\ncourse of the transactions, which side has given the justest relation.\r\n\r\nI cannot, however, forbear remarking, that I see expressions of\r\ncivility, on the part of the committee, making a figure in the message,\r\nvery different from their genuine intention; being introduced in a\r\nmanner that gives them the air of concessions in favor of the conduct\r\nof the Council. Your Excellency will certainly recollect, that the\r\ncommittee were very remote from a concurrence in sentiment with the\r\nCouncil; and though they did not presume to judge of the disposition of\r\nthe citizens, strongly urged the expedience and necessity of calling\r\nout the militia, and facility of employing them with success against\r\nan unofficered and disorderly body of mutinous soldiers. It is true,\r\nalso, that they acknowledged the candor with which the Council exposed\r\nto them, what they deemed the temper of their citizens, and their own\r\ndifficulties and embarrassments; which were, no doubt, delineated\r\nwith great energy of language, and display of circumstances: but they\r\ncertainly never admitted the candor of refusing an answer in writing,\r\nwhich was a part of the _business_ transacted with the Council; nor\r\ndid they _withdraw_, without giving an intelligible intimation of\r\ntheir sense of this proceeding. I was also surprised to see any part of\r\nthe private and confidential conversation I had with your Excellency,\r\nushered into the message from the Council; and moulded into such a\r\nshape, as to imply, by an obvious construction, an approbation of\r\ntheir reasons. Your Excellency will admit the following state of this\r\ntransaction to be a just one.\r\n\r\nI waited upon the Council to correct a piece of information I had\r\ngiven them respecting ammunition: but even this is misstated, as will\r\nbe seen by my minutes. Having done this, my official business ended;\r\nwhen I was taken aside by your Excellency, and a conversation passed\r\nin declared confidence. You informed me, that a meeting of the militia\r\nofficers was then holding, and in consultation with the Council about\r\neventual measures (in consequence, as I conjectured, of a communication\r\nto you, the preceding evening, from the delegates of the State, of the\r\nintention of Congress to remove from the city, in case they did not\r\nreceive satisfactory assurances of support). You added, that you hoped\r\nnothing would be precipitated; but that proper allowances would be made\r\nfor the situation of the Council.\r\n\r\nI understood your observations with reference to the departure of\r\nCongress, and replied to this effect: That I viewed the departure of\r\nCongress as a delicate measure, including consequences important to\r\nthe national character abroad, and critical with respect to the State\r\nof Pennsylvania, and, in particular, the city of Philadelphia; that\r\nthe triumph of a handful of mutinous soldiers, permitted in a place\r\nwhich is considered as the capital of America, to surround, and, in\r\nfact, imprison Congress, without the least effort, on the part of the\r\ncitizens, to uphold their dignity and authority, so as to oblige them\r\nto remove from the place which had been their residence during the\r\nRevolution, would, it was to be feared, be viewed at a distance, as a\r\ngeneral disaffection of the citizens to the Federal Government; might\r\ndiscredit its negotiations, and affect the national interests: that,\r\nat home, it might give a deep wound to the reputation of Pennsylvania;\r\nmight draw upon it the resentments of the other States, and sow discord\r\nbetween Congress and the State; that the removal of Congress would\r\nprobably bring the affair to a crisis; and, by convincing the mutineers\r\nthat extremities were intended, would either intimidate them into a\r\nsubmission, or determine them to immediate excesses; that, impressed\r\nwith these considerations, and still hoping, notwithstanding some\r\nappearances to the contrary, that the mutineers might be sincere in\r\ntheir professions of submission, or that the Council, on further\r\nexamination, would find it in their power to act with vigor, I\r\nhad declined giving my assent to a report in writing, which would\r\nnecessarily be followed by the departure of Congress; that though the\r\ncommittee had no discretion, by the powers under which they acted, but\r\nwere bound by the tenor of their instructions, the moment they did not\r\nreceive “satisfactory assurances of prompt and adequate exertions, on\r\nthe part of the State, for supporting the public authority,” to advise\r\nthe adjournment of Congress to Trenton or Princeton; and I therefore\r\nconsidered the delay of this advice as at their extreme peril; yet,\r\nas to myself, I should persist in it, till the result of the present\r\nconsultation with the militia officers, or till some new circumstance\r\nshould turn up, to explain the designs of the mutineers; and in\r\npursuing this line of conduct, I should counteract the sense of some\r\ngentlemen, whose feelings upon the occasion were keen, and the opinions\r\nof others, who thought the situation of Congress, under the existing\r\ncircumstances, extremely awkward, precarious, and unjustifiable to\r\ntheir constituents.\r\n\r\nYour Excellency approved my intention; wished for time; and promised,\r\nif any new resolution should be taken, to give me immediate notice of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe meeting of the militia officers dissolved. I heard nothing from\r\nyour Excellency. General St. Clair, about two in the afternoon,\r\ninformed the committee, that the officers appointed by the soldiers to\r\nmanage their business, had, in the first instance, refused to give him\r\nan account of their transactions; the which was only extracted from\r\nthem by a peremptory demand. He mentioned to us the instructions they\r\nhad received from the soldiers, which contained faint and affected\r\nconcessions, mixed with new and inadmissible claims.\r\n\r\nThe whole affair wore the complexion of collusion between the officers\r\nof the committee and the soldiery; and of a mere amusement on their\r\npart, till they could gain fresh strength and execute their project,\r\nwhatever it might be, with greater advantage.\r\n\r\nThis behavior of the officers gave the affair a new and more serious\r\naspect, and overcame my opposition to the report. Mr. Peters, on\r\nhearing the relation of General St. Clair, declared, at once, that he\r\nthought the committee had then no alternative; at least, what he said\r\nwas understood in this sense by General St. Clair, Mr. Ellsworth, and\r\nmyself. If I am not much mistaken, General St. Clair also expressed his\r\nopinion that Congress were unsafe in the city.\r\n\r\nThe ideas I suggested to your Excellency, in the conversation I have\r\nmentioned, were substantially expressed to several members of Congress\r\nas the motives of my delay; and particularly, I recollect, to Mr.\r\nMadison, with these observations in addition: That though I was fully\r\nconvinced Congress, under an immediate view of circumstances, would,\r\nin reality, be justified in withdrawing from a place where such an\r\noutrage to government had been with impunity perpetrated, by a body\r\nof armed mutineers, still, for several days, in complete command of\r\nthe city, and where either the feebleness of public councils, or the\r\nindisposition of the citizens, afforded no assurance of protection\r\nand support; yet, as the opinions of men would be governed by events,\r\nand as the most probable event was, that the removal of Congress,\r\nannouncing decisive measures of coercion to the soldiery, would awe\r\nthem into submission, there was great danger that the reputation of\r\nCongress would suffer by the easy termination of the business; and that\r\nthey would be accused of levity, timidity, or rashness.\r\n\r\nThough not within the scope of my original intention, I will indulge\r\na few additional reflections on this subject. I am sensible that the\r\nCouncil, in some respects, stand upon advantageous ground in this\r\ndiscussion. Congress left the city, because they had no forces at\r\nhand, no jurisdiction over the militia, and no assurances of effectual\r\nsupport from those who had. The Council, as the Executive of the\r\nState, were necessitated to remain on the spot. Soon after Congress\r\nremoved, the mutineers were deserted by their leaders, and surrendered\r\nat discretion.\r\n\r\nThe multitude will be very apt to conclude, that the affair was of\r\ntrifling consequence; that it vanished under its own insignificance;\r\nthat Congress took up the matter in too high a tone of authority; that\r\nthey discovered a prudish nicety and irritability about their own\r\ndignity: that Council were more temperate, more humane, and possessed\r\nof greater foresight.\r\n\r\nThe bias in favor of an injured army; the propensity of the human mind\r\nto lean to the speciousness of professed humanity, rather than to the\r\nnecessary harshness of authority; the vague and imperfect notions of\r\nwhat is due to public authority, in an infant popular government; and\r\nthe insinuating plausibility of a well-constructed _message_; will all\r\ncontribute to that conclusion.\r\n\r\nBut let us suppose an impartial man of sense, well acquainted with\r\nfacts, to form an argument upon the subject. It appears to me, he might\r\nnaturally fall into this train of combination.\r\n\r\nIt is a well known fact, that, from the necessities of the war, or\r\nthe delinquencies of the several States, Congress were not enabled to\r\ncomply with their engagements to the army, which, after a glorious\r\nand successful struggle for their country, much suffering, exemplary\r\npatience, and signal desert, they were compelled, by the irresistible\r\ndictates of an empty treasury and a ruined credit, to disband, after\r\nhaving given strong indications of their discontent, and resentment of\r\nthe public neglect. A large part of the army suffer themselves to be\r\npatiently dismissed; a particular corps of four or five hundred men,\r\nstationed in the place where Congress reside, refuse to accept their\r\ndischarges but on certain specified conditions.\r\n\r\nThey even go further, and, stimulated by their injuries, or encouraged\r\nand misled by designing persons, are emboldened to send a threatening\r\nmessage to Congress, declaring to them, that unless they would do them\r\njustice immediately, they would find means of redress for themselves.\r\nMeasures are indirectly taken to appease this disorder, and give the\r\ndiscontented soldiers as much satisfaction as the situation of things\r\nwill permit. Shortly after, accounts are received, that another corps,\r\nat     miles distance, have also mutinied; and that a part of them, to\r\nthe number of about eighty men, are on their march to join those who\r\nhad already discovered so refractory a disposition. A committee of\r\nCongress is immediately appointed to confer with the Executive of\r\nthe State, on the measures proper to be pursued in this exigency.\r\nThat committee, in the first instance, suggest to the Council,\r\nthe expedience of calling out a body of militia, to intercept the\r\ndetachment of mutineers on its march, and represent the danger of\r\nthe progress of the spirit of mutiny, and of future outrages, should\r\nthose on their march be suffered, without molestation, to join a more\r\nnumerous corps in the same temper with themselves.\r\n\r\nThe Council urge a variety of difficulties: the shortness of the\r\ntime to collect the militia before the mutineers would arrive; the\r\nreluctance with which the citizens would obey a call against men whom\r\nthey consider as meritorious, and injured, and the like. The committee,\r\nperceiving the unwillingness of the Council to employ the militia,\r\ndesist from pressing, and recur to expedients. The day after, the\r\nmutineers march in triumph into the city, and unite themselves with\r\nthose who are already there; and the following day, the whole body\r\nassemble in arms, throw off all obedience to their officers, and, in\r\nopen defiance of government, march to the place which is the usual\r\nseat of Congress and the Council of the State, while both are actually\r\nsitting; surround it with guards, and send a message to the Council,\r\ndemanding authority to appoint, themselves, officers to command them,\r\nwith absolute discretion to take such measures as those officers should\r\nthink proper, to redress their grievances; accompanied with a threat,\r\nthat if there was not a compliance in twenty minutes, they would let in\r\nan injured soldiery upon them, and abide the consequence.\r\n\r\nThe members of Congress who were at the time assembled, request General\r\nSt. Clair, who happened to be present, to take such measures as he\r\nshould judge expedient, without committing the honor of government,\r\nto divert the storm, and induce the troops to return to their quarters\r\nwithout perpetrating acts of violence. General St. Clair, in concert\r\nwith the Council, grants the mutineers permission to elect, out of\r\nofficers then, or formerly, in commission, such as they should confide\r\nin, to represent their grievances to the Council, with a promise, that\r\nthe Council would confer with the persons elected for that purpose.\r\nHaving obtained this promise, the mutineers return to their quarters,\r\nin military parade, and continue in open defiance of government.\r\n\r\nThe concession made was a happy compromise between an attention to\r\ndignity, and a prudent regard to safety.\r\n\r\nMen who had dared to carry their insolence to such an extreme, and who\r\nsaw no opposition to their outrages, were not to be expected to retreat\r\nwithout an appearance, at least, of gratifying their demands. The\r\nslightest accident was sufficient to prompt men, in such a temper and\r\nsituation, to tragical excesses.\r\n\r\nBut however it might become the delicacy of government not to depart\r\nfrom the promise it had given, it was its duty to provide effectually\r\nagainst a repetition of such outrages; and to put itself in a situation\r\nto give, instead of receiving, the law; and to manifest that its\r\ncompliance was not the effect of necessity, but of choice.\r\n\r\nThis was not to be considered as the disorderly riot of an unarmed mob,\r\nbut as the deliberate mutiny of an incensed soldiery, carried to the\r\nutmost point of outrage short of assassination. The licentiousness of\r\nan army is to be dreaded in every government; but, in a republic, it\r\nis more particularly to be restrained; and when directed against the\r\ncivil authority, to be checked with energy, and punished with severity.\r\nThe merits and sufferings of the troops might be a proper motive for\r\nmitigating punishment, when it was in the power of the government\r\nto inflict it; but it was no reason for relaxing in the measures\r\nnecessary to put itself in that situation. Its authority was first to\r\nbe vindicated, and then its clemency to be displayed.\r\n\r\nThe rights of government are as essential to be defended, as the rights\r\nof individuals. The security of the one is inseparable from that of\r\nthe other. And, indeed, in every new government, especially of the\r\npopular kind, the great danger is, that public authority will not be\r\nsufficiently respected.\r\n\r\nBut upon this occasion, there were more particular reasons for decision.\r\n\r\nCongress knew there were, within two or three days’ march of the city,\r\na more considerable body of the same corps, part of which had mutinied\r\nand come to town, and had been the chief actors in the late disorder;\r\nthat those men had, with difficulty, been kept, by the exertions of\r\ntheir officers, from joining the insurgents in the first instance; that\r\nthere was another corps in their neighborhood which, a little time\r\nbefore, had also discovered symptoms of mutiny; that a considerable\r\npart of the same line which were in mutiny in town, was every moment\r\nexpected to arrive from the southward, and, there was the greatest\r\nreason to conclude, would be infected with the same spirit, on their\r\narrival, as had presently happened in the case of a small detachment\r\nwhich had joined a few days before; that there were, besides, large\r\nnumbers of disbanded soldiers, scattered through the country, in want,\r\nand who had not yet had time to settle down to any occupation, and\r\nexchange their military for private habits; that some of these were\r\nreally coming in, and adding themselves to the revolters; that an\r\nextensive accession of strength might be gained from these different\r\nquarters; and that there were all the sympathies of like common wrongs,\r\ndistresses, and resentments, to bring them together, and to unite them\r\nin one cause. The partial success of those who had already made an\r\nexperiment, would be a strong encouragement to others; the rather, as\r\nthe whole line had formerly mutinied, not only with impunity, but with\r\nadvantage to themselves.\r\n\r\nIn this state of things, decision was most compatible with the safety\r\nof the community, as well as the dignity of government. Though no\r\ngeneral convulsion might be to be apprehended, serious mischiefs\r\nmight attend the progress of the disorder. Indeed, it would have been\r\nmeanness, to have negotiated and temporized with an armed banditti of\r\nfour or five hundred men; who, in any other situation than surrounding\r\na defenceless senate, could only become formidable by being feared.\r\nThis was not an insurrection of a whole people: it was not an army with\r\ntheir officers at their head, demanding the justice of their country;\r\neither of which might have made caution and concession respectable: it\r\nwas a handful of mutinous soldiers, who had equally violated the laws\r\nof discipline, as the rights of public authority.\r\n\r\nCongress, therefore, wisely resolve, that “it is necessary that\r\neffectual measures be immediately taken for supporting the public\r\nauthority;” and call upon the State in which they reside, for the\r\nassistance of its militia, at the same time that they send orders for\r\nthe march of a body of regular forces as an eventual resource.\r\n\r\nThere was a propriety in calling for the aid of the militia in the\r\nfirst place, for different reasons. Civil government may always, with\r\nmore peculiar propriety, resort to the aid of the citizens, to repel\r\nmilitary insults or encroachments.\r\n\r\n’Tis there, it ought to be supposed, where it may seek its surest\r\ndependence, especially in a democracy, which is the creature of the\r\npeople. The citizens of each State are, in an aggregate light, the\r\ncitizens of the United States, and bound, as much to support the\r\nrepresentatives of the whole, as their own immediate representatives.\r\nThe insult was not to Congress personally; it was to the government,\r\nto public authority in general; and was very properly put upon that\r\nfooting. The regular forces, which Congress could command, were at a\r\ngreat distance, and could not, but in a length of time, be brought\r\nto effectuate their purpose. The disorder continued to exist on the\r\nspot where they were; was likely to increase by delay; and might be\r\nproductive of sudden and mischievous effects by being neglected.\r\n\r\nThe city and the Bank were in immediate danger of being rifled; and,\r\nperhaps, of suffering other calamities. The citizens, therefore, were\r\nthe proper persons to make the first exertion.\r\n\r\nThe objection, that these were not the objects of the care of Congress,\r\ncan only serve to mislead the vulgar. The peace and safety of the place\r\nwhich was the immediate residence of Congress, _endangered, too, by\r\nthe troops of the United States_, demanded their interposition. The\r\nPresident of the State of Pennsylvania was himself of this opinion;\r\nhaving declared to a member of that body, that as their troops were the\r\noffenders, it was proper for them to declare the necessity of calling\r\nout the militia, as a previous step to its being done.\r\n\r\nNor is there more weight in the supposition that the danger was\r\ninconsiderable; and that, from the pacific appearances of the troops,\r\nit was to be expected, the disorder would subside of itself. The facts\r\nwere, that the troops still continued in a state of mutiny; had made no\r\nsubmissions, nor offered any; and that they affected to negotiate with\r\ntheir arms in their hands.\r\n\r\nA band of mutinous soldiers, in such a situation, uncontrolled, and\r\nelated with their own power, was not to be trusted.\r\n\r\nThe most sudden vicissitudes and contradictory changes were to be\r\nexpected; and a fit of intoxication was sufficient, at any moment,\r\nwith men who had already gone such length, to make the city a scene of\r\nplunder and massacre. It was the height of rashness to leave the city\r\nexposed to the bare possibility of such mischiefs.\r\n\r\nThe only question, in this view, is, Whether there was greater\r\ndanger to the city, in attempting their reduction by force, than in\r\nendeavoring, by palliatives, to bring them to a sense of duty? It has\r\nbeen urged, and appeared to have operated strongly upon the minds of\r\nthe Council,[24] that the soldiers being already embodied, accustomed\r\nto arms, and ready to act at a moment’s warning, it would be extremely\r\nhazardous to attempt to collect the citizens to subdue them, as the\r\nmutineers might have taken advantage of the first confusion incident to\r\nthe measure, to do a great deal of mischief, before this militia could\r\nhave assembled in equal or superior force.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be denied, but that a small body of disciplined troops,\r\nheaded and led by their officers, with a plan of conduct, could have\r\neffected a great deal in similar circumstances; but it is equally\r\ncertain, that nothing can be more contemptible, than a body of men,\r\nused to be commanded and to obey, when deprived of the example and\r\ndirection of their officers. They are infinitely less to be dreaded\r\nthan an equal number of men who have never been broken to command, nor\r\nexchanged their natural courage for that artificial kind which is the\r\neffect of discipline and habit. Soldiers transfer their confidence from\r\nthemselves to their officers, face danger by the force of example,\r\nthe dread of punishment, and the sense of necessity. Take away these\r\ninducements and leave them to themselves, they are no longer resolute\r\nthan till they are opposed.\r\n\r\nIn the present case, it was to be relied upon, that the appearance of\r\nopposition would instantly bring the mutineers to a sense of their\r\ninsignificance, and to submission. Conscious of their weakness, from\r\nthe smallness of their numbers; in a populous city, and in the midst of\r\na populous country; awed by the consequences of resisting government\r\nby arms, and confounded by the want of proper leaders and proper\r\ndirection; the common soldiers would have thought of nothing but making\r\ntheir peace by the sacrifice of those who had been the authors of their\r\nmisconduct.\r\n\r\nThe idea, therefore, of coercion, was the safest and most prudent: for\r\nmore was to be apprehended from leaving them to their own passions,\r\nthan from attempting to control them by force. It will be seen, by and\r\nby, how far the events, justly appreciated, corresponded with this\r\nreasoning.\r\n\r\nCongress were not only right in adopting measures of coercion; but\r\nthey were also right in resolving to change their situation, if proper\r\nexertions were not made by the particular government and citizens of\r\nthe place where they resided. The want of such exertions would evince\r\nsome defect, no matter where, that would prove they ought to have no\r\nconfidence in their situation. They were, to all intents and purposes,\r\nin the power of a lawless, armed banditti, enraged, whether justly,\r\nor not, against them. However they might have had a right to expose\r\ntheir own persons to insult and outrage, they had no right to expose\r\nthe character of representatives, or the dignity of the States they\r\nrepresented, or of the Union. It was plain, they could not, with\r\npropriety, in such a state of things, proceed in their deliberations\r\nwhere they were; and it was right they should repair to a place where\r\nthey could do it. It was far from impossible, that the mutineers might\r\nhave been induced to seize their persons, as hostages for their own\r\nsecurity, as well as with a hope of extorting concessions. Had such\r\nan event taken place, the whole country would have exclaimed, Why did\r\nnot Congress withdraw from a place where they found they could not be\r\nassured of support; where the government was so feeble, or the citizens\r\nso indisposed, as to suffer three or four hundred mutinous soldiers\r\nto violate, with impunity, the authority of the United States, and of\r\ntheir own State?\r\n\r\nWhen they resolved to depart, on the want of adequate exertions, they\r\nhad reason to doubt their being made, from the disinclination shown by\r\nthe Council to call out the militia in the first instance: and when\r\nthey did actually depart, they were informed by the Council, that\r\nthe efforts of the citizens were not to be looked for, even from a\r\nrepetition of the outrage which had already happened; and it was to\r\nbe doubted what measure of outrage would produce them. They had also\r\nconvincing proof, that the mutiny was more serious than it had even at\r\nfirst appeared, by the participation of some of the officers.\r\n\r\nTo throw the blame of harshness and precipitancy upon Congress, it is\r\nsaid, that their dignity was only _accidentally_ and _undesignedly_\r\noffended. Much stress has been laid upon the message, from the\r\nsoldiery being directed to the Council, and not to them. All this,\r\nhowever, is very immaterial to the real merits of the question.\r\nWhatever might have been the first intention of the mutineers in this\r\nparticular act, whether it proceeded from artifice or confusion of\r\nideas, the indignity to Congress was the same. They knew that Congress\r\ncustomarily held their deliberations at the State House: and if it\r\neven be admitted, that they knew Saturday to be a day of usual recess,\r\nwhich, perhaps, is not altogether probable: when they came to the\r\nplace they saw, and knew, Congress to be assembled there. They did not\r\ndesist in consequence of this; but proceeded to station their guards,\r\nand execute their purposes. Members of Congress went out to them;\r\nremonstrated with them; represented the danger of their proceedings\r\nto themselves, and desired them to withdraw: but they persisted till\r\nthey obtained what they supposed a part of their object. A majority of\r\nthe same persons had, some days before, sent a message, almost equally\r\nexceptionable, to Congress; and at the time they scarcely spoke of any\r\nother body than Congress; who, indeed, may naturally be supposed to\r\nhave been the main object of their resentments: for Congress, having\r\nalways appeared to the soldiery, to be the body who contracted with\r\nthem, and who had broken faith with them, it is not to be supposed they\r\nwere capable of investigating the remote causes of the failures, so as\r\nto transfer the odium from Congress to the State.\r\n\r\nBut the substantial thing to be considered in this question, is the\r\nviolation of public authority. It cannot be disputed, that the mutiny\r\nof troops is a violation of that authority to which they owe obedience.\r\nThis was, in the present case, aggravated to a high degree of\r\natrociousness, by the gross insult to the government of Pennsylvania,\r\nin the face of Congress, and in defiance of their displeasure. It was\r\nfurther aggravated by continuing in that condition for a series of time.\r\n\r\nThe reasons have been assigned, that made it incumbent upon Congress\r\nto interpose; and when they called upon the State of Pennsylvania, not\r\nonly to vindicate its own rights, but to support their authority, the\r\ndeclining a compliance was a breach of the Confederation, and of the\r\nduty which the State of Pennsylvania owed to the United States. The\r\nbest apology for the government of Pennsylvania, in this case, is,\r\nthat they could not command the services of their citizens. But so\r\nimproper a disposition in the citizens, if admitted, must operate as an\r\nadditional justification to Congress, in their removal.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent events, justly appreciated, illustrate the propriety\r\nof their conduct. The mutineers did not make voluntary submissions\r\nin consequence of negotiation, persuasion, or conviction. They did\r\nnot submit till after Congress had left the city, publishing their\r\nintentions of coercion; till after there had been an _actual call_\r\nupon the militia; till their leaders and instigators, alarmed by the\r\napproach of force, and the fear of being betrayed by the men, fled.\r\nThey were reduced by coercion, not overcome by mildness. It appears,\r\ntoo, that while they were professing repentance, and a return to their\r\nduty, they were tampering with the troops at Yorktown and Lancaster,\r\nto increase their strength; and that two officers, at least, were\r\nconcerned in the mutiny, who, by their letters since, have confessed,\r\nthat some project of importance was in contemplation.\r\n\r\nThe call for the militia was made the day after it had been pronounced\r\nineligible by the Council. There could have been little change, in that\r\ntime, either in the temper or preparations of the citizens. The truth\r\nis, that the departure of Congress brought the matter to a crisis; and\r\nthat the Council were compelled, by necessity, to do what they ought to\r\nhave done before, through choice.\r\n\r\nIt is to be lamented they did not, by an earlier decision, prevent the\r\nnecessity of Congress taking a step which may have many disagreeable\r\nconsequences. They then would\r\n\r\n[_The residue of the manuscript is not found._]\r\n\r\n\r\n[20] These blanks are in the manuscript.\r\n\r\n[21] This blank is in the manuscript.\r\n\r\n[22] “The words, as reported by the committee to Congress, were, ‘It,’\r\ni.e., the arming of the citizens to suppress the mutineers, ‘was not\r\nto be expected, merely from a repetition of the insult which had\r\nhappened.’”--Note by Col. Pickering.\r\n\r\n[23] “Mr. Ellsworth was the other member of the committee.--T. P.”\r\n\r\n[24] Your Excellency will recollect, that, in our private conversation,\r\nyou urged this consideration, and appealed to my military experience;\r\nand that I made, substantially, the observations which follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      Princeton, June 29, 1783.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nI am informed, that, among other disagreeable things said about the\r\nremoval of Congress from Philadelphia, it is insinuated, that it\r\nwas a contrivance of some members, to get them out of the State of\r\nPennsylvania, into one of those to which they belonged; and I am told,\r\nthat this insinuation has been pointed at me in particular.\r\n\r\nThough I am persuaded, that all disinterested persons will justify\r\nCongress in quitting a place where they were told they were not to\r\nexpect support (for the conduct of the Council amounted to that), yet,\r\nI am unwilling to be held up as having had an extraordinary agency\r\nin the measure for interested purposes, when the fact is directly\r\nthe reverse. As you were a witness to my conduct and opinions through\r\nthe whole of the transaction, I am induced to trouble you for your\r\ntestimony upon this occasion. I do not mean to make a public use of it;\r\nbut, through my friends, to vindicate myself from the imputations I\r\nhave mentioned.\r\n\r\nI will therefore request your answers to the following questions:\r\n\r\nDid that part of the resolutions, which related to the removal of\r\nCongress, originate with me, or not?\r\n\r\nDid I, as a member of the committee, appear to press the departure; or\r\ndid I not rather manifest a strong disposition to postpone that event\r\nas long as possible, even against the general current of opinion?\r\n\r\nI wish you to be as particular and full in your answer as your memory\r\nwill permit. I think you will recollect, that my idea was clearly\r\nthis: That the mutiny ought not to be terminated by negotiation; that\r\nCongress were justifiable in leaving a place where they did not receive\r\nthe support which they had a right to expect; but, as their removal\r\nwas a measure of a critical and delicate nature; might have an ill\r\nappearance in Europe; and might, from events, be susceptible of an\r\nunfavorable interpretation in this country; it was prudent to delay it\r\ntill its necessity became apparent: not only till it was manifest there\r\nwould be no change in the spirit which seemed to actuate the Council;\r\nbut till it was evident, complete submission was not to be expected\r\nfrom the troops; that, to give full time for this, it would be proper\r\nto delay the departure of Congress till the latest period which would\r\nbe compatible with the idea of meeting at Trenton or Princeton on\r\nThursday--perhaps even till Thursday morning.\r\n\r\n                                  I am, Sir, your most obedient servant,\r\n                                  A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo James Madison, Junior, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO JAMES MADISON, JR.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    Philadelphia, July 6, 1783.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nOn my arrival in this city I am more convinced than I was of the\r\nnecessity of giving a just state of facts to the public. The current\r\nruns strongly against Congress, and in a great measure for want of\r\ninformation. When facts are explained they make an impression, and\r\nincline to conclusions more favorable to us.\r\n\r\nI have no copy of the Reports in my possession, which puts it out of my\r\npower to publish them. Will you procure and send me one without loss of\r\ntime? Without appearing, I intend to give them to the public with some\r\nadditional explanations. This done with moderation will no doubt have a\r\ngood effect.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing idea is, that the actors in the removal of Congress\r\nwere influenced by the desire of getting them out of the city, and the\r\ngenerality of the remainder by timidity--some say passion. Few give a\r\nmore favorable interpretation.\r\n\r\nI will thank you in your letter to me to answer the following question:\r\n\r\nWhat appeared to be my ideas and disposition respecting the removal of\r\nCongress? Did I appear to wish to hasten it, or did I not rather show a\r\nstrong disposition to procrastinate it?\r\n\r\nI will be obliged to you in answering this question to do it fully. I\r\ndo not intend to make any public use of it, but through my friends to\r\nvindicate myself from the insinuation I have mentioned, and in that\r\nto confute the supposition that the motive assigned did actuate the\r\nmembers on whom it fell to be more particularly active.\r\n\r\n                                                   Yours,\r\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO MRS. HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   Philadelphia, July 22, 1783.\r\n\r\nI wrote you, my beloved Eliza, by the last post, which I hope will\r\nnot meet with the fate that many others of my letters must have met\r\nwith. I count upon setting out to see you in four days; but I have\r\nbeen so frequently disappointed by unforeseen events, that I shall\r\nnot be without apprehensions of being detained, till I have begun my\r\njourney. The members of Congress are very pressing with me not to go\r\naway at this time, as the House is thin, and as the definitive treaty\r\nis momently expected.\r\n\r\nTell your father that Mr. Rivington, in a letter to the South Carolina\r\ndelegates, has given information, coming to him from Admiral Arbuthnot,\r\nthat the Mercury frigate is arrived at New-York with the definitive\r\ntreaty, and that the city was to be evacuated yesterday, by the treaty.\r\n\r\nI am strongly urged to stay a few days for the ratification of the\r\ntreaty; at all events, however, I will not be long absent.\r\n\r\nI give you joy of the happy conclusion of this important work in which\r\nyour country has been engaged. Now, in a very short time, I hope we\r\nshall be happily settled in New-York.\r\n\r\nMy love to your father. Kiss my boy a thousand times.\r\n\r\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO GOVERNOR CLINTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      Princeton, July 27, 1783.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nA few days since I was honored with your Excellency’s letter of the\r\n ; and was glad to find your ideas on the subject\r\ncorresponded with mine.\r\n\r\nAs I shall, in a day or two, take leave of Congress, I think it my\r\nduty to give my opinion to the Legislature, on a matter of importance\r\nto the State, which has been long depending, and is still without a\r\nprospect of termination in the train in which it has been placed: I\r\nmean the affair of the Grants. It is hazardous to pass a positive\r\njudgment on what will happen in a body so mutable as that of Congress;\r\nbut from all I have seen, I have come to a settled opinion, that no\r\ndetermination will be taken and executed by them in any other manner,\r\nthan in that prescribed by the Confederation. There is always such\r\na diversity of views and interests; so many compromises to be made\r\nbetween different States; that, in a question of this nature, the\r\nembarrassments of which have been increased by the steps that have\r\npreceded, and in which the passions of the opposite sides have taken\r\na warm part, decision must be the result of necessity. While Congress\r\nhave a discretion, they will procrastinate: when they are bound by the\r\nConstitution, they must proceed.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, my opinion, that it will be advisable for the\r\nLegislature, when they meet, to review the question; and either to\r\nrelinquish their pretensions to the country in dispute, or to instruct\r\ntheir delegates, if a decision is not had within a limited time, to\r\ndeclare the submission to Congress revoked, and to institute a claim\r\naccording to the principles of the Confederation.\r\n\r\nIt would be out of my province to discuss which side of the alternative\r\nought, in policy, to prevail: but I will take the liberty to observe,\r\nthat if the last should be preferred, it would be expedient to remove\r\nevery motive of opposition from private claims; not only by confirming,\r\nin their full latitude, previous to the trial, the possessions of the\r\noriginal settlers, but even the grants of the usurped government. It\r\nmay happen, that it will be eventually necessary to employ force;\r\nand, in this case, it would be of great importance that neither the\r\ninhabitants of the Grants, nor powerful individuals in other States,\r\nshould find their private interest in contradiction to that of the\r\nState. This has already had great influence in counteracting our\r\nwishes; would continue to throw impediments in the way of ulterior\r\nmeasures; and might at last kindle a serious flame between the States.\r\n\r\nI communicated to your Excellency, in a former letter, that I had\r\ndeclined pressing the application of the Legislature to Congress,\r\nrespecting the State troops for garrisoning the frontier posts, because\r\ntemporary provision had been made in another way, which would save the\r\nState the immediate expense; and because there was a prospect of some\r\ngeneral provision for the defence of the frontiers on a Continental\r\nestablishment, which was to be preferred on every account. A report for\r\nthis purpose is now before Congress; but the thinness of representation\r\nhas, for some time, retarded, and still retards, its consideration.\r\n\r\nThe definitive treaty is not yet arrived; but from accounts which,\r\nthough not official, appear to deserve credit, it may be daily\r\nexpected. A gentleman, known and confided in, has arrived at\r\nPhiladelphia, who informs, that he saw a letter from Dr. Franklin to\r\nMr. Barkeley, telling him that the definitive treaties were signed the\r\ntwenty-seventh of May, between all the parties; that New-York was to be\r\nevacuated in six months from the ratification of the preliminaries in\r\nEurope, which will be the twelfth or fifteenth of next month.\r\n\r\nAs it is not my intention to return to Congress, I take this\r\nopportunity to make my respectful acknowledgments to the Legislature,\r\nfor the honorable mark of their confidence conferred upon me, by having\r\nchosen me to represent the State in that body. I shall be happy if my\r\nconduct has been agreeable to them.\r\n\r\n                                                 With perfect respect,\r\n                                                 I have the honor to be,\r\n                                                 Your Excellency’s\r\n                                                 Most obedient servant,\r\n                                                 A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nTo his Excellency General Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLINTON TO DUANE AND L’HOMMEDIEU.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          Aug. 23, 1783.\r\n\r\n* * * * I would take this opportunity also of calling your attention to\r\nconcurrent resolutions of the Legislature, respecting the garrisoning\r\nof the Western posts in this State, which, by the provisional treaty,\r\nare to be evacuated by the British. These resolutions were in the tenor\r\nof instructions to our delegates, and were immediately transmitted to\r\nthem; but as I have not been favored with any official information of\r\nthe result, I submit it to you whether some report on a subject so\r\ninteresting to the State, may not be necessary for the satisfaction\r\nof the Legislature. From informal communications made to me by the\r\nCommander-in-Chief, I have reason to believe, that he has directions\r\nfrom Congress for garrisoning those posts with continental troops,\r\nand that he is making arrangements for that purpose. But as you will\r\nobserve, that as it was the sense of the Legislature, that those posts\r\nshould have been garrisoned by the State, an explanation on the subject\r\nbecomes the more necessary; and it is now for this reason alone, I\r\nwould request, that you would be pleased to favor me with a particular\r\ndetail of the motives which influenced the determination of Congress on\r\nthis occasion. For it will readily be perceived, that should Congress,\r\nat this late day, accede to the propositions made by the State, it\r\nmight be impracticable to carry them into execution, especially, as I\r\nhave not ventured, in the state of uncertainty in which I was left,\r\nto incur the expense which the necessary preparations for the purpose\r\nwould have required * * *\r\n\r\n                                                  Geo. Clinton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDUANE AND L’HOMMEDIEU TO FLOYD AND HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                               Princeton, 1783.\r\n\r\nHonorable Gentlemen:\r\n\r\nWe inclose you an extract of Dispatches from his Excellency our\r\nGovernor, received this day, respecting the instructions of the\r\nLegislature, at their last session, for the security of the Western\r\nposts.\r\n\r\nYou will be pleased to observe, that an official Report, on a subject\r\nso interesting to the State, is deemed to be necessary; as well\r\nas a particular detail of the motives which influenced Congress\r\nagainst the declared sense of the State; to give directions to the\r\nCommander-in-Chief for garrisoning those posts with Continental troops.\r\nThis is a duty to which, not having been present at the debates, we\r\nfind ourselves incompetent. We can therefore, only refer His Excellency\r\nand the Legislature to you, our worthy colleagues, who, being fully\r\npossessed of the facts, can alone give the necessary official\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n                  With sentiments of the most perfect esteem and regard,\r\n                  We have the honor to be,\r\n                  Gentlemen,\r\n                  Your most obedient servants,\r\n                  Jas. Duane.\r\n                  Ezra L’Hommedieu.\r\n\r\n  The Honorable\r\n  Cols. William Floyd and\r\n  Alexander Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAY TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                         Passy, Sept. 28, 1783.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nYou was always of the number of those I esteemed, and your\r\ncorrespondence would both be interesting and agreeable. I had heard of\r\nyour marriage, and it gave me pleasure, as well because it added to\r\nyour happiness, as because it tended to fix your residence in a State\r\nof which I long wished you to be and remain a citizen.\r\n\r\nThe character and talents of delegates to Congress daily become more\r\nand more important, and I regret your declining that appointment at\r\nthis interesting period. Respect, however, is due to the considerations\r\nwhich influence you, but as they do not oppose your accepting a place\r\nin the Legislature, I hope the State will still continue to draw\r\nadvantage from your services; much remains to be done, and laborers do\r\nnot abound.\r\n\r\nI am happy to hear that terms of peace, and the conduct of your\r\nnegotiators, give general satisfaction: but there are some of\r\nour countrymen, it seems, who are not content; and that, too,\r\nwith an article which I thought to be very unexceptionable; viz.,\r\nthe one ascertaining our boundaries. Perhaps those gentlemen are\r\nlatitudinarians.\r\n\r\nThe American newspapers, for some months past, contain advices which\r\ndo us harm. Violences and associations against the tories, pay an ill\r\ncompliment to government, and impeach our good faith in the opinion of\r\nsome, and our magnanimity in the opinion of many. Our reputation also\r\nsuffers, from the apparent reluctance to taxes, and the ease with which\r\nwe incur debts without providing for their payment. The complaints of\r\nthe army; the jealousies respecting Congress; the circumstances which\r\ninduced their leaving Philadelphia; and the too little appearance\r\nof a national spirit pervading, uniting, and invigorating the\r\nConfederacy, are considered as omens which portend the diminution of\r\nour respectability, power, and felicity.\r\n\r\nI hope that, as the wheel turns round, other and better indications\r\nwill soon appear. I am persuaded that America possesses too much wisdom\r\nand virtue, to permit her brilliant prospects to fade away for want of\r\neither.\r\n\r\nThe tories are almost as much pitied in these countries as they are\r\nexecrated in ours. An undue degree of severity towards them, would,\r\ntherefore, be impolitic, as well as unjustifiable. They who incline\r\nto involve that whole class of men in indiscriminate punishment and\r\nruin, certainly carry the matter too far. It would be an instance of\r\nunnecessary rigor, and unmanly revenge, without a parallel, except in\r\nthe annals of religious rage in times of bigotry and blindness. What\r\ndoes it signify where nine-tenths of these people are buried? I would\r\nrather see the sweat of their brows fertilize our fields than those of\r\nour neighbors. * * * * *\r\n\r\nVictory and Peace should, in my opinion, be followed by Clemency,\r\nModeration, and Benevolence: and we should be careful not to sully the\r\nglory of the Revolution, by licentiousness and cruelty. These are my\r\nsentiments: and however unpopular they may be, I have not the least\r\ndesire to conceal or disguise them.\r\n\r\n                                 Believe me to be,\r\n                                 With great regard and esteem, dear Sir,\r\n                                 Your most obedient humble servant,\r\n                                 John Jay.\r\n\r\n\r\nColonel A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    Albany, September 30, 1783.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nAs I flatter myself I may indulge a consciousness that my services have\r\nbeen of some value to the public, at least enough to merit the small\r\ncompensation I wish, I will make no apology to your Excellency, for\r\nconveying, through you, that wish to Congress. You are able to inform\r\nthem, if they wish information, in what degree I may have been useful:\r\nand I have entire confidence that you will do me justice.\r\n\r\nIn a letter which I wrote to you several months ago, I intimated\r\nthat it might be in your power to contribute to the establishment\r\nof our Federal Union upon a more solid basis. I have never since\r\nexplained myself. At the time, I was in hopes Congress might have\r\nbeen induced to take a decisive ground; to inform their constituents\r\nof the imperfections of the present system, and of the impossibility\r\nof conducting the public affairs, with honor to themselves and\r\nadvantage to the community, with powers so disproportioned to their\r\nresponsibility; and, having done this, in a full and forcible manner,\r\nto adjourn the moment the definitive treaty was ratified. In retiring\r\nat the same juncture, I wished you, in a solemn manner, to declare to\r\nthe people, your intended retreat from public concerns; your opinion of\r\nthe present government, and of the absolute necessity of a change.\r\n\r\nBefore I left Congress I despaired of the first; and your circular\r\nletter to the States had anticipated the last. I trust it will not be\r\nwithout effect; though I am persuaded it would have had more, combined\r\nwith what I have mentioned. At all events, without compliment, sir, it\r\nwill do you honor with the sensible and well meaning; and, ultimately,\r\nit is to be hoped, with the people at large, when the present epidemic\r\nfrenzy has subsided.\r\n\r\n                                                  I am, dear Sir,\r\n                                                  With sincere esteem,\r\n                                                  Your obedient servant,\r\n                                                  A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nTo His Excellency General Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    Albany, September 30, 1783.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nI think I may address the subject of this letter to your Excellency\r\nwith more propriety than to any other person, as it is purely of\r\na military nature; as you are best acquainted with my services as\r\nan officer; and as you are now engaged in assisting to form the\r\narrangements for the future peace establishment.\r\n\r\nYour Excellency knows, that in March, ’82, I relinquished all claim to\r\nany future compensation for my services, either during the residue of\r\nthe war, or after its conclusion--simply retaining my rank. On this\r\nfoundation I build a hope, that I may be permitted to preserve my rank,\r\non the peace establishment, without emoluments and unattached to any\r\ncorps--as an honorary reward for the time I have devoted to the public.\r\nAs I may hereafter travel, I may find it an agreeable circumstance to\r\nappear in the character I have supported in the Revolution.\r\n\r\nI rest my claim solely on the sacrifice I have made; because I have\r\nno reason to believe that my services have appeared of any value to\r\nCongress; as they declined giving them any marks of their notice, on\r\nan occasion which appeared to my friends to entitle me to it, as well\r\nby the common practice of sovereigns, as by the particular practice of\r\nthis country in repeated instances.\r\n\r\nYour Excellency will recollect, that it was my lot at York Town to\r\ncommand, as senior officer, a successful attack upon one of the enemy’s\r\nredoubts; that the officer who acted in a similar capacity in another\r\nattack, made at the same time by the French troops, has been handsomely\r\ndistinguished, in consequence of it, by the government to which he\r\nbelongs; and that there are several examples among us, where Congress\r\nhave bestowed honors upon actions, perhaps not more useful nor,\r\napparently, more hazardous.\r\n\r\nThese observations are inapplicable to the present Congress, further\r\nthan as they may possibly furnish an additional motive to a compliance\r\nwith my wish.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I ask of your Excellency, is, that my application\r\nmay come into view in the course of the consultations on the peace\r\nestablishment.\r\n\r\n                                                 I have the honor to be,\r\n                                                 With sincere esteem,\r\n                                                 Your Excellency’s\r\n                                                 Most obedient servant,\r\n                                                 A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nTo His Excellency General Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO GOVERNOR CLINTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       Albany, October 3, 1783.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nI have lately received from Messrs. Duane and L’Hommedieu, an extract\r\nof a letter from your Excellency to the delegates, of the twenty-third\r\nof August last, requesting “a particular detail of the motives\r\nwhich influenced the determination of Congress,” respecting the\r\napplication of the Legislature to have their State troops released from\r\nContinental pay, for the purpose of garrisoning the frontier posts. In\r\nmy letters to your Excellency, of the first of June and twenty-seventh\r\nof July, which were intended to be official, I summarily informed you,\r\nthat Congress had made temporary provision for garrisoning the frontier\r\nposts, and that a plan was under deliberation relative to a peace\r\nestablishment, which would, of course, embrace that object permanently;\r\nthat such temporary provision being made at the common expense, and a\r\ngeneral plan being under consideration for the future, I had declined\r\npressing a compliance with the application of the Legislature;\r\nconceiving it to be more for the interest of the State, that the\r\nexpense should be jointly borne, than that it should fall exclusively\r\nupon itself.\r\n\r\nI did not enter into a more full detail upon the subject, because the\r\nbusiness continued, to the time I left Congress, in an undecided state;\r\nand it was impossible to judge what views would finally prevail.\r\n\r\nThe concurrent resolutions of the two Houses had been immediately, on\r\ntheir receipt, referred to a committee appointed to report on a peace\r\nestablishment, who had suspended their report on these resolutions,\r\ntill it should appear, what would be the fate of a general plan which\r\nhad been submitted.\r\n\r\nAs to the motives that influenced Congress in making the provision\r\nthey did make, rather than immediately assenting to the application\r\nof the State; as far as I was able to collect them, they were these:\r\nThe opinions of many were unsettled as to the most eligible mode of\r\nproviding for the security of the frontiers, consistent with the\r\nConstitution, as well with respect to the general policy of the Union,\r\nas to considerations of justice to those States whose frontiers were\r\nmore immediately exposed. A considerable part of the House appeared to\r\nthink, from reasons of a very cogent nature, that the well-being of the\r\nUnion required a federal provision for the security of the different\r\nparts; and that it would be a great hardship to individual States,\r\npeculiarly circumstanced, to throw the whole burthen of expense upon\r\nthem, by recurring to separate provisions, in a matter, the benefit of\r\nwhich would be immediately shared by their neighbors, and, ultimately,\r\nby the Union at large: that, indeed, it was not probable particular\r\nStates would be either able, or, _upon experiment_, willing, to make\r\ncompetent provision at their separate expense; and that the principle\r\nmight eventually excite jealousies between the States unfriendly to the\r\ncommon tranquillity.\r\n\r\nI freely confess I was one who held this opinion.\r\n\r\nQuestions naturally arose as to the true construction of the articles\r\nof Confederation upon this head; questions as delicate as interesting,\r\nand as difficult of solution.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, it was doubted whether Congress were authorized by the\r\nConfederation, to proceed upon the idea of a federal provision: on the\r\nother, it was perceived that such a contrary construction would be\r\ndangerous to the Union, including, among other inconveniences, this\r\nconsequence: That the United States, in Congress, cannot raise a single\r\nregiment, nor equip a single ship, for the general defence, till after\r\na declaration of war, or an actual commencement of hostilities.\r\n\r\nIn this dilemma, on an important constitutional question; other urgent\r\nmatters depending before Congress; and the advanced season requiring a\r\ndetermination upon the mode of securing the western posts in case of\r\na surrender this fall; all sides of the House concurred in making a\r\ntemporary provision, in the manner which has been communicated.\r\n\r\nMy apprehension of the views of the Legislature was simply this:\r\nThat, looking forward to a surrender of the posts, and conceiving,\r\nfrom some expressions in the articles of Confederation, that separate\r\nprovision was to be made for the frontier garrisons; they had thought\r\nit expedient to apply the troops already on foot to that purpose, and\r\nto propose to Congress to give their sanction to it.\r\n\r\nUnder this apprehension; reflecting, besides, that those troops were\r\nengaged only for a short period, upon a very improper establishment to\r\ncontinue, on account of the enormous pay to the private men; and that\r\nthe expense which is now shared by all, and which would have fallen\r\nsolely upon the State, had the application been complied with; would\r\nprobably be at the rate of nearly eighty thousand dollars per annum, a\r\nconsiderable sum for the State in its present situation; I acknowledge\r\nto your Excellency, that I saw with pleasure, rather than regret,\r\nthe turn which the affair took. I shall be sorry, however, if it has\r\ncontravened the intentions of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nI will take the liberty to add, upon this occasion, that it has always\r\nappeared to me of great importance, to this State in particular, as\r\nwell as to the Union in general, that Federal, rather than State,\r\nprovision should be made for the defence of every part of the\r\nConfederacy, in peace as well as in war.\r\n\r\nWithout entering into arguments of general policy, it will be\r\nsufficient to observe, that this State is, in all respects _critically\r\nsituated_.\r\n\r\nIts relative position, shape, and intersections, viewed on the map,\r\nstrongly speak this language.--Strengthen the Confederation; give it\r\nexclusively the power of the sword: let each State have no forces but\r\nits militia.\r\n\r\nAs a question of mere economy, the following considerations deserve\r\ngreat weight.\r\n\r\nThe North River facilitates attacks by sea and by land: and, besides\r\nthe frontier forts, all military men are of opinion, that a strong post\r\nshould be maintained at West Point, or some other position on the lower\r\npart of the river.\r\n\r\nIf Canada is well governed, it may become well peopled, and by\r\ninhabitants attached to its government. The British nation, while it\r\npreserves the idea of retaining possession of that country, may be\r\nexpected to keep on foot there, a large force. The position of that\r\nforce, either for defence or offence, will necessarily be such as will\r\nafford a prompt and easy access to us.\r\n\r\nOur precautions for defence, must be proportioned to their means of\r\nannoying us: and we may hereafter find it indispensable to increase our\r\nfrontier garrisons.\r\n\r\nThe present charge of a competent force in that quarter, thrown\r\nadditionally, into the scale of those contributions which we must make\r\nto the payment of the public debt, and to other objects of general\r\nexpense, if the Union lasts, would, I fear, enlarge our burthen beyond\r\nour ability: that charge, hereafter increased, as it may be, would be\r\noppressively felt by the people. It includes, not only the expense of\r\npaying and subsisting the necessary number of troops, but of keeping\r\nthe fortifications in repair; probably of creating others; and of\r\nfurnishing the requisite supplies of military stores. I say nothing\r\nof the Indian nations, because, though it will be always prudent to\r\nbe upon our guard against them, yet, I am of opinion we diminish the\r\nnecessity of it by making them our friends: and I take it for granted,\r\nthere cannot be a serious doubt, any where, as to the obvious policy of\r\nendeavoring to do it. Their friendship, alone, can keep our frontiers\r\nin peace. It is essential to the improvement of the fur trade; an\r\nobject of immense importance to the State. The attempt at the total\r\nexpulsion of so desultory a people, is as chimerical as it would be\r\npernicious. War with them is as expensive as it is destructive: it has\r\nnot a single object; for, the acquisitions of their lands is not to\r\nbe wished, till those now vacant are settled: and the surest, as well\r\nas the most just and humane way of removing them, is by extending our\r\nsettlements to their neighborhood.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it is not impossible they may be already willing to exchange\r\ntheir former possessions for others more remote.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing considerations would lose all force, if we had full\r\nsecurity that the rest of the world would make our safety and\r\nprosperity the first object of their reverence and care: but an\r\nexpectation of this kind would be too much against the ordinary course\r\nof human affairs; too visionary to be a rule for national conduct.\r\n\r\nIt is true, our situation secures us from conquest, if internal\r\ndissensions do not open the way: but when nations now make war upon\r\neach other, the object seldom is total conquest. Partial acquisitions;\r\nthe jealousy of power; the rivalship of dominion, or of commerce;\r\nsometimes national emulation and antipathy; are the motives.\r\n\r\nNothing shelters us from the operation of either of these causes.\r\nThe fisheries; the fur trade; the navigation of the lakes and of the\r\nMississippi; the western territory; the Islands of the West Indies,\r\nwith reference to traffic; in short, the passions of human nature,\r\nare abundant sources of contention and hostility. I will not trespass\r\nfurther on your Excellency’s patience. I expected, indeed, that my last\r\nletter would have finished my official communications; but Messrs.\r\nDuane and L’Hommedieu having transmitted the extract of your letter\r\nto Mr. Floyd and myself, in order that we might comply with what your\r\nExcellency thought would be expected by the Legislature, it became my\r\nduty to give this explanation. Mr. Floyd having been at Congress but a\r\nlittle time after the concurrent resolutions arrived, and being now at\r\na great distance from me, occasions a separate communication.\r\n\r\n                                                 I have the honor to be,\r\n                                                 With perfect respect,\r\n                                                 Your Excellency’s\r\n                                                 Most obedient servant,\r\n                                                 A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nN. B. I did not at the time inclose the resolution, directing the\r\nGeneral to provide for garrisoning the frontier posts, because I\r\nunderstood it would in course be transmitted to you by the President,\r\nor the Secretary at War.\r\n\r\n                                                                   A. H.\r\n\r\nTo his Excellency Governor Clinton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMADISON TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   Princeton, October 16, 1783.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nYour favor of the sixth of July, by some singular ill luck, never found\r\nits way to my hands till yesterday evening.\r\n\r\nThe only part that now needs attention, is a request that I would\r\nanswer the following question: “What appeared to be my ideas and\r\ndisposition respecting the removal of Congress: did I appear to wish\r\nto hasten it, or did I not rather show a strong disposition to\r\nprocrastinate it?” If this request had been received at the time it\r\nought, it might have been answered as fully as you then wished. Even\r\nafter the delay which has taken place, my recollection enables me, with\r\ncertainty, to witness, that the uniform strain of your sentiments, as\r\nthey appeared, both from particular conversations with myself, and\r\nincidental ones with others in my presence, was opposed to the removal\r\nof Congress, except in the last necessity; that when you finally\r\nyielded to the measure, it appeared to be more in compliance with the\r\nperemptory expostulations of others than with any disposition of your\r\nown mind; and that after the arrival of Congress at Princeton, your\r\nconversation showed that you reviewed the removal, rather with regret\r\nthan with pleasure.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this obedience to your wishes may be too late to answer the\r\noriginal object of them. But I could not omit such an opportunity of\r\ntestifying the esteem and regard with which I am\r\n\r\n                                                Your obedient servant,\r\n                                                J. Madison, Jr.\r\n\r\nTo the Hon. Alexander Hamilton, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  Rocky Hill, October 18, 1783.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nI am favored with your two letters of the thirtieth of September.\r\n\r\nThe debate on Indian affairs, which, I believe, is got through,\r\nand that on the residence of Congress, which is yet in agitation,\r\nhave entirely thrown aside, for some time, the consideration of the\r\npeace establishment. When it is resumed, I will take care that your\r\napplication comes into view; and shall be happy if any thing in my\r\npower may contribute to its success; being, with great truth,\r\n\r\n                                             Dear Sir,\r\n                                             Your most obedient servant,\r\n                                             G. Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Colonel Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMcHENRY TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   Princeton, October 22, 1783.\r\n\r\nDear Hamilton:\r\n\r\nThe homilies you delivered in Congress are still recollected with\r\npleasure. The impressions they made are in favor of your integrity;\r\nand no one but believes you a man of honor and republican principles.\r\nWere you ten years older and twenty thousand pounds richer, there is\r\nno doubt but that you might obtain the suffrages of Congress for the\r\nhighest office in their gift. You are supposed to possess various\r\nknowledge, useful, substantial, and ornamental. Your very grave and\r\nyour cautious, your men who measure others by the standard of their\r\nown creeping politics, think you sometimes intemperate, but seldom\r\nvisionary: and that were you to pursue your object with as much cold\r\nperseverance as you do with ardor and argument, you would become\r\nirresistible. In a word, if you could submit to spend a whole life\r\nin dissecting a fly, you would be, in their opinion, one of the\r\ngreatest men in the world. Bold designs; measures calculated for their\r\nrapid execution; a wisdom that would convince from its own weight; a\r\nproject that would surprise the people into greater happiness, without\r\ngiving them an opportunity to view it and reject it; are not adapted\r\nto a council composed of discordant elements, or a people who have\r\nthirteen heads, each of which pay superstitious adorations to inferior\r\ndivinities.\r\n\r\nI have been deterred, from day to day, from sending you the extract you\r\ndesire, by a proclamation on the subject, which I expected would have\r\npassed. It is still _in dubio_. I have reported on Fleury’s case, on\r\nthe principle you recommend. I fear his half-pay will not be granted.\r\n\r\nCongress, some time ago, determined to fix their Federal town on the\r\nDelaware, near Trenton. Yesterday they determined to erect a second\r\nFederal town on the Potomac, near Georgetown; and to reside equal\r\nperiods (not exceeding one year) at Annapolis and Trenton, till the\r\nbuildings are completed. We adjourn the twelfth of next month, to meet\r\nat Annapolis the twenty-sixth.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my dear friend; and in the days of your happiness drop a line to\r\nyours.\r\n\r\n                                                 James McHenry.\r\n\r\nP.S. Our exemplification of the Treaty has passed, and will be\r\ntransmitted to the State officially.\r\n\r\n                                                        J. McH.\r\n\r\nTo the Hon. Alexander Hamilton, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  Rocky Hill, November 6, 1783.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nThe inclosed is a letter which I had written, and was about to dispatch\r\nat the date of it; but, upon second thoughts, determined to postpone\r\nit, and try, if, from the importance of the matter, I could not bring\r\nforward the peace establishment previously.\r\n\r\nI have tried in vain. Congress, after resolving, on the ---- of last\r\nmonth, to adjourn upon the twelfth of this, did, equally unexpectedly\r\nand surprisingly to me, finish their session at this place the day\r\nbefore yesterday; without bringing the peace establishment, or any of\r\nthe many other pressing matters, to a decision.\r\n\r\nFinding this was likely to be the case, I showed your letter to some\r\nof your particular friends; and consulted with them on the propriety\r\nof making known your wishes with my testimonial of your services to\r\nCongress; but they advised me to decline it, under a full persuasion\r\nthat no discrimination would, or indeed, could, be made at this late\r\nhour, as every other officer, from the highest to the lowest grades\r\n(not in actual command), were retiring without the retention of rank;\r\nand that the remainder, upon a peace establishment (if a Continental\r\none should ever take place), would come in upon the new system, under\r\nfresh appointments; so that unless you wished to come into actual\r\ncommand again (which none supposed), they saw no way by which you could\r\npreserve your rank.\r\n\r\nI have the pleasure to inclose you a brevet, giving you the rank of\r\nfull Colonel.\r\n\r\n                                             I am, dear Sir,\r\n                                             Your most obedient servant,\r\n                                             G. Washington.\r\n\r\nTo Colonel Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    New-York, December 8, 1783.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nBeing concerned as counsel for a number of persons who have been,\r\nsince the annunciation of the provisional treaty, indicted under the\r\nconfiscation laws of this State, for the part they are supposed to have\r\ntaken in the late war, we are induced, at the desire of our clients,\r\nand in their behalf, to apply to Congress, through your Excellency, for\r\nan exemplification of the definitive treaty. We take it for granted,\r\nthat ere this it will have been         direction of the United States.\r\nWe have found a great strictness in the Courts in this State. It will,\r\nwe apprehend, be necessary to be able to produce an exemplification\r\nof the treaty under the seal of the United States. In a matter so\r\ninteresting to a great number of individuals, for it does not belong\r\nto us to urge considerations of national honor, we hope we shall be\r\nexcused when we observe, that there appears to be no probability that\r\nthe legislature of this State will interpose its authority to put\r\na stop to prosecutions, till the definitive treaty is announced in\r\nform. In the mean time, a period is limited for the appearance of the\r\nindicted persons to plead to their indictments, and if they neglect\r\nto appear, judgment by default will be entered against them. It is\r\ntherefore of great consequence to them, that we should have in our\r\npossession, as speedily as possible, an authentic document of the\r\ntreaty, and of its ratification by Congress; and we, on this account,\r\npray an exemplification of both.\r\n\r\nWe persuade ourselves that the justice and liberality of Congress will\r\ninduce a ready compliance with our prayer, which will conduce to the\r\nsecurity of a great number of individuals who derive their hopes of\r\nsafety from the national faith.\r\n\r\n                           We have the honor to be with perfect respect,\r\n                           Your Excellency’s\r\n                           Most obedient and humble servants,\r\n                           A. Hamilton & others.\r\n\r\n  His Excellency\r\n  The President of Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO J. B. CHURCH.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      New-York, March 10, 1784.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir:\r\n\r\nIn my last to you I informed you that a project for a land bank had\r\nbeen set on foot by Mr. Sayre, as the ostensible parent; but that I\r\nhad reason to suspect the Chancellor was the true father. The fact has\r\nturned out as I supposed, and the Chancellor, with a number of others,\r\nhave since petitioned the Legislature for an exclusive charter for the\r\nproposed bank. I thought it necessary, not only with a view to your\r\nproject, but for the sake of the commercial interests of the State, to\r\nstart an opposition to this scheme; and took occasion to point out its\r\nabsurdity and inconvenience to some of the most intelligent merchants,\r\nwho presently saw the matter in a proper light, and began to take\r\nmeasures to defeat the plan.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor had taken so much pains with the country members,\r\nthat they all began to be persuaded that the land bank was the true\r\nPhilosopher’s stone that was to turn all their rocks and trees into\r\ngold; and there was great reason to apprehend a majority of the\r\nLegislature would have adopted his views. It became necessary to\r\nconvince the projectors themselves of the impracticability of their\r\nscheme; and to counteract the impressions they had made by a direct\r\napplication to the Legislature. Some of the merchants, to effect these\r\npurposes, set on foot a subscription for a money bank, and called upon\r\nme to subscribe. I was a little embarrassed how to act, but upon the\r\nwhole I concluded it best to fall in with them, and endeavor to induce\r\nthem to put the business upon such a footing as might enable you, with\r\nadvantage, to combine your interests with theirs; for since the thing\r\nhad been taken up upon the broad footing of the whole body of the\r\nmerchants, it appeared to me that it never would be your interest to\r\npursue a distinct project in opposition to theirs; but that you would\r\nprefer, so far as you might choose to employ money in this way, to\r\nbecome purchasers in the general bank. The object, on this supposition,\r\nwas to have the bank founded on such principles as would give you a\r\nproper weight in the direction. Unluckily, for this purpose, I entered\r\nrather late into the measure: proposals had been agreed upon, in which,\r\namong other things, it was settled that no stockholder, to whatever\r\namount, should have more than seven votes, which was the number to\r\nwhich a holder of ten shares was to be entitled. At an after meeting\r\nof some of the most influential characters, I engaged them so far to\r\ndepart from this ground, as to allow a vote for every five shares above\r\nten.\r\n\r\nThe stockholders have since thought proper to appoint me one of the\r\ndirectors. I shall hold it till Wadsworth and you come out, and, if you\r\nchoose to become parties to this bank, I shall make a vacancy for one\r\nof you. I inclose you the constitution, and the names of the President,\r\nDirectors, and Cashier.\r\n\r\nAn application for a charter has been made to the Legislature, with\r\na petition against granting an exclusive one to the land bank. The\r\nmeasures which have been taken appear to have had their effect upon the\r\nminds of the partisans of the land bank.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of the bank in Pennsylvania appear to be in some\r\nconfusion. They have stopped discounts; but I have no apprehension that\r\nthere is any thing more in the matter than temporary embarrassment from\r\nhaving a little overshot their mark in their issues of paper, and from\r\nthe opposition which the attempt to establish a new bank had produced.\r\n\r\n                                                   Yours affectionately,\r\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nJ. B. Church, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO FITZSIMMONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      New-York, March 21, 1784.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nPermit me to introduce to your acquaintance and attention Mr.\r\nSeton, Cashier of the Bank of New-York. He is just setting out for\r\nPhiladelphia to procure materials and information in the forms of\r\nbusiness. I recommend him to you, because I am persuaded you will with\r\npleasure facilitate his object. Personally, I dare say you will be\r\npleased with him.\r\n\r\nHe will tell you of our embarrassments and prospects. I hope an\r\nincorporation of the two banks, which is evidently the interest of\r\nboth, has put an end to differences in Philadelphia. Here a wild and\r\nimpracticable scheme of a land bank stands in our way; the projectors\r\nof it persevering in spite of the experience they have, that all the\r\nmercantile and moneyed influence is against it.\r\n\r\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM SETON TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  Philadelphia, 27 March, 1784.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nYou will observe by my letter of this day to our President, that I have\r\nbeen requested to postpone my visit to the bank until they shall be\r\nwell informed that the Bank of New-York has, or actually will, obtain\r\na charter. Although I am confident this is only an ostensible reason\r\nfor not wishing to see me at the bank, it will be highly necessary I\r\nshould be regularly informed of what is doing in this respect, that I\r\nmay be able to speak fully and with firmness to the subject; therefore,\r\nexclusive of any letter the director may write to me, I trust you will\r\ncommunicate to me whatever may appear to you essential for me to know.\r\n\r\nThe fact is (and which cannot be communicated to the many, and\r\ntherefore not mentioned in my official letter), their motive for not\r\nwishing to see me at the bank just now, arises from their being at\r\npresent in very great confusion--the opposition of the new bank began\r\nit, and being pressed so hard by this opposition, they were obliged\r\nto lay themselves so open, that it evidently appeared, if carried\r\nfurther, it would strike too fatal a blow. Therefore, for the safety\r\nof the community at large, it became absolutely necessary to drop the\r\nidea of a new bank, and to join hand in hand to relieve the old bank\r\nfrom the shock it had received. Gold and silver had been extracted in\r\nsuch amounts that discounting was stopped, and for this fortnight past\r\nnot any business has been done at the bank in this way. The distress\r\nit has occasioned to those dependent on circulation and engaged in\r\nlarge speculations, is severe; and, as if their cup of misery must\r\noverflow, by the last arrival from Europe, intelligence is received\r\nthat no less a sum than £60,000 sterling of Mr. Morris’s bills, drawn\r\nfor the Dutch loan, are under protest. It is well known that the bank,\r\nby some means or other, must provide for this sum. The child must not\r\ndesert its parent in distress, and, such is their connection, that\r\nwhatever is fatal to the one must be so to the other. However, the man\r\nwho has more than once, by his consummate abilities, saved the American\r\nEmpire from ruin, will no doubt be found equal to overcome these\r\ntemporary inconveniences, and to restore universal confidence and good\r\norder. I trust you will be guarded in your conversation with others\r\non this subject, lest it might recoil on me, and not only place me in\r\na disagreeable situation, but defeat the purposes of my coming there.\r\nI have had several interviews with our friend Gov. Morris; he is for\r\nmaking the bank of New-York a branch of the bank of North America, but\r\nwe differ widely in our ideas of the benefit that would result from\r\nsuch a connection.\r\n\r\nIf it will not be intruding too much upon your time and goodness, may\r\nI request that you will now and then inform me what is doing by our\r\nLegislature, and permit me to assure you, that it will ever give me\r\nsingular pleasure to have it in my power to evince the respect and\r\nesteem with which\r\n\r\n                                       I am, dear Sir,\r\n                                       Your ob’t and very humble serv’t,\r\n                                       Wm. Seton.\r\n\r\nAlexander Hamilton, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       New-York, April 4, 1784.\r\n\r\nPardon me, my dear sir, for not sooner having obeyed your orders with\r\nrespect to the inclosed. I part with it reluctantly; for wit is so\r\nrare an article, that when we get so much of it in so small a compass,\r\nwe cannot easily consent to be dispossessed of it. I am very happy to\r\nhear of the union of your two Banks; for you will believe me when I\r\ntell you, that, on more deliberate consideration, I was led to view\r\nthe competition in a different light from that in which it at first\r\nstruck me. I had no doubt that it was against the interests of the\r\nproprietors; but, on a superficial view, I perceived benefits to the\r\ncommunity, which, on a more close inspection, I found were not real.\r\n\r\nYou will call our proceedings here _strange doings_. If some folks were\r\npaid to counteract the prosperity of the State, they could not take\r\nmore effectual measures than they do. But it is in vain to attempt to\r\nkick against the pricks.\r\n\r\nDiscrimination bills; partial taxes; schemes to engross public property\r\nin the hands of those who have present power; to banish the real\r\nwealth of the State, and to substitute paper bubbles; are the only\r\ndishes that suit the public palate at this time.\r\n\r\nPermit me to ask your opinion on a point of importance to the New-York\r\nBank--the best mode of receiving and paying out gold. I am aware of the\r\nevils of that which has been practised upon in Philadelphia--_weighing\r\nin quantities_; but I cannot satisfy myself about a substitute, unless\r\nthere could be a coinage.\r\n\r\nFavor me with your sentiments on this subject as soon as you can.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, with equal warmth and sincerity,\r\n\r\n                                                   Yours,\r\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nTo Gouverneur Morris, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO DE CHASTELLUX.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       New-York, June 14, 1784.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Le Chevalier:\r\n\r\nColonel Clarkeson, who will have the honor of delivering you this,\r\nbeing already known to you, I give him this letter more for the sake\r\nof renewing to you the assurances of my attachment and esteem, than\r\nfrom a supposition that he will stand in need of any new title to\r\nyour attention. I will therefore only say of him, that his excellent\r\nqualities cannot be known without interesting those to whom they are\r\nknown, and that from a personal and warm regard for him, I should be\r\nhappy, if any thing I could say, could be an additional motive for your\r\ncountenance and civilities to him.\r\n\r\nI speak of him in the light of a friend. As the messenger of Science,\r\nhe cannot fail to acquire the patronage of one of her favorite\r\nministers. He combines with the views of private satisfaction, which a\r\nvoyage to Europe cannot but afford, an undertaking for the benefit of\r\na Seminary of learning, lately instituted in this State. Learning is\r\nthe common concern of mankind; and why may not poor republicans, who\r\ncan do little more than wish her well, send abroad to solicit the favor\r\nof her patrons and friends? Her ambassador will tell you his errand.\r\nI leave it to your mistress to _command_ and to the trustees of the\r\ninstitution to _ask_ your interest in promoting his mission.\r\n\r\nPermit me only to add, that if there is any thing in this country by\r\nwhich I can contribute to your satisfaction, nothing will make me\r\nhappier at all times, than that your commands may enable me to give you\r\nproofs of the respectful and affectionate attachment with which\r\n\r\n                                       I have the honor to be,\r\n                                       Monsieur Le Chevalier,\r\n                                       Your most ob’t and humble serv’t,\r\n                                       A. H.\r\n\r\nLe Chevalier De Chastellux.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOUVERNEUR MORRIS TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   Philadelphia, June 30, 1784.\r\n\r\nDear Hamilton:\r\n\r\nThis is rather a late period to acknowledge yours of the seventh of\r\nApril. I have lived in the constant intention to answer it, and I\r\nnow execute my purpose. But why not sooner? “Procrastination is the\r\nthief of time,” says Dr. Young. I meant to have written fully on the\r\nsubject of the gold. But I waited some informations from Annapolis on\r\nthe probability of a Mint. I afterwards intended a long letter upon\r\na subject I mentioned to Mr. Seton, namely, a coalition between your\r\nBank and the National Bank. I do not find either party inclined to it.\r\nAnd yet both would be the better for it. You, I believe, will soon be\r\nout of blast unless it should take place. I could say a great deal\r\non this subject, but it would be very useless. When you find your\r\ncash diminish very fast, remind Seton of my predictions, and let him\r\ntell you what they were. If the Legislature should attempt to force\r\npaper money down your throats, it would be a good thing to be somewhat\r\nindependent of them. But I must check myself, or I shall go too far\r\ninto a business which would plague us both to no purpose. It shall be\r\nleft, therefore, until we meet.\r\n\r\n                                              Very affectionately yours,\r\n                                              Gouv. Morris.\r\n\r\nAlexander Hamilton, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLA FAYETTE TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                          Albany, Oct. 8, 1784.\r\n\r\nDear Hamilton:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSeveral delays have retarded the opening of the Treaty; and when I\r\nwas upon the ground, it has been found that my influence with the\r\nIndians, both friendly and hostile tribes, was much greater than the\r\nCommissioners, and even myself, had conceived; so that I was requested,\r\neven by every one of the tribes there, to speak to those nations. There\r\nwere some, more or less, from each tribe. I stayed as long as the\r\nCommissioners thought I could do them some good; and that has rather\r\ncramped my private plans of visits.\r\n\r\nNow, my dear friend, I am going to Hartford, Boston, Newport; from\r\nthence, by water, to Virginia, in order to save time; and about the\r\ntwentieth of next month I hope to be again with you in New-York: but\r\nbefore that time will write you from Newport.\r\n\r\n                                         Adieu, my dear Hamilton.\r\n                                         Most affectionately I am yours,\r\n                                         La Fayette.\r\n\r\nP.S. I am told Mr. Jay is not determined upon accepting. I much wish he\r\nmay consent to it; the more so, as his probable successor does not hit\r\nmy fancy. Indeed, I very much wish Mr. Jay may accept the office.\r\n\r\nTo Colonel Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLA FAYETTE TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                         Boston, Oct. 22, 1784.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Hamilton:\r\n\r\nEvery step I move, there comes upon me a happy necessity to change my\r\nplans. The reception I met with in Boston no words can describe; at\r\nleast it is impossible to express what I have felt. Gratitude as well\r\nas propriety conspired with all other inducements to keep me here some\r\ntime longer. Rhode Island and New Hampshire I must visit, and intend\r\nembarking by the first or second day of next month for Virginia, in\r\nthe Nymph frigate, which has been sent on my account. In less than\r\nfour weeks’ time from this day, I hope to be with Congress; and when\r\nmy business there is concluded, will come to New-York, where I hope we\r\nwill spend some days together. My stay in your city has been too short,\r\nfar inadequate to the feelings of my gratitude, and to the marks of\r\ngoodness bestowed upon me; but this time I will be some days longer\r\nwith my New-York friends.\r\n\r\nUpon reflecting on my situation, my circumstances, my love for America,\r\nand yet the motives that might render it improper for her to employ me\r\nin a public capacity, I have confined myself to a plan which, at the\r\nsame time that it gratifies my attachment and serves the United States,\r\ncannot have any shadow of inconvenience. After having told me they\r\nknow my zeal, I wish Congress to add, they want me to continue those\r\nfriendly, and, I might say, patriotic exertions; that in consequence\r\nof it, their ministers at home, and their ministers abroad, will have\r\na standing order to look to me as one whose information and exertions\r\nwill ever be employed to the service of the United States; and when\r\nthey think it is wanted, to communicate with me upon the affairs of\r\nAmerica; that Congress will, whenever I think it proper, be glad of my\r\ncorrespondence.\r\n\r\nUpon that general scale, every minister may conceal from me what he\r\npleases, may write to me only when he pleases; and should he ever think\r\nmy assistance is wanting, he has a title to ask, I have one to give\r\nit; and my connection with America is for ever kept, without giving\r\njealousy, upon such a footing as will remain at the disposition of each\r\npublic servant of Congress.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me, my dear friend, this idea already met with your\r\napprobation. In case it does, do promote it with your delegates and\r\nothers. If it does not, write it to me by the bearer whom I send by\r\nland to apologize to the General for my delays.\r\n\r\nOur friend Knox has been most affectionate and kind to me.\r\n\r\n                                                    Yours for ever,\r\n                                                    La Fayette.\r\n\r\nP.S. I have written to Wadsworth, and spoken to Bostonians respecting\r\nthe Baron’s affairs. I will do the same in Virginia, Maryland, and\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nTo Alexander Hamilton, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLA FAYETTE TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                         Paris, April 13, 1785.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Hamilton:\r\n\r\nAlthough I have just now written to McHenry, requesting him to impart\r\nmy Gazette to you, a very barren one indeed, I feel within myself a\r\nwant to tell you, I love you tenderly. Your brother Church has sailed\r\nfor America, since which I had a letter from his lady, who is in very\r\ngood health. By an old letter from our friend Greene, I have been\r\ndelighted to find he consents to send his son to be educated with mine;\r\nthe idea makes me very happy. I wish, dear Hamilton, you would honor\r\nme with the same mark of your friendship and confidence. As there is\r\nno fear of a war, I intend visiting the Prussian and Austrian troops.\r\nIn one of your New-York Gazettes, I find an association against the\r\nslavery of negroes, which seems to me worded in such a way as to give\r\nno offence to the moderate men in the southern States. As I ever have\r\nbeen partial to my brethren of that color, I wish, if you are one in\r\nthe society, you would move, in your own name, for my being admitted on\r\nthe list. My best respects wait on Mrs. Hamilton. Adieu.\r\n\r\n                                               Your affectionate friend,\r\n                                               La Fayette.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Grosvenor-Square, London, Oct. 19, 1785.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nAt the instance of Mr. Hartley, in behalf of his friend, Mr. Francis\r\nUpton, I advised Mr. Upton to apply to some counsellor in New-York,\r\nand particularly to Mr. Hamilton, whose reputation was known to me,\r\nalthough his person was not.\r\n\r\nMr. Hartley now requests for Mr. Upton a letter of introduction. As a\r\ntotal stranger, but by character, it would be very difficult to find a\r\npretence to excuse the liberty I take in presenting Mr. Upton to you,\r\nand recommending his case to your attention. But, as we say at the bar,\r\nwhere I wish I was, _valeat quantum valere potest._ With much esteem,\r\n\r\n                             I have the honor to be, Sir,\r\n                             Your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n                             John Adams.\r\n\r\nMr. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO WILKES.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                      November, 8, 1785.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nThe message which you sent me yesterday, and your letter to-day,\r\nwere conceived in terms to which I am little accustomed. Were I to\r\nconsult my feelings only upon the occasion, I should return an\r\nanswer very different from that which I have, in justice to my own\r\nconduct, resolved upon. But in whatever light we are to view each\r\nother hereafter, and however harsh and indelicate I may think the\r\nmethod you have taken to obtain an explanation to be, I shall, for\r\nmy own part, leave no room to suppose that I intentionally gave you\r\nany cause to complain. I shall, therefore, explicitly declare, that\r\nwhatever inattention may have appeared towards you, was solely owing\r\nto the continual hurry in which my engagements, for a long time past,\r\nhave kept me; and that, so far from its having been occasioned by\r\nany designed neglect, it was what, under the circumstances, might\r\nhave happened to my best friend. Indeed, much of what you mention to\r\nhave been done by you, I am a stranger to. The frequent callings, by\r\nyourself and by your servant, did not, that I recollect, come to my\r\nknowledge. It is possible some of them might have been mentioned to\r\nme, and, in the hurry of my mind, forgotten. Once, I remember, I saw\r\nyour servant just as I was going out on some urgent business. I sent\r\na verbal message, promising that I would see you; which I intended\r\nto do, as soon as I had made up my resolution on the business of the\r\ninterview. When I received your note I was about sending you an answer\r\nin writing; but, upon inquiring for your servant, and finding him gone,\r\nI omitted it, with an intention to see you personally.\r\n\r\nYou say it is near six months since you first applied to me on the\r\nbusiness in question. A great part of the time I gave you all the\r\nanswer I could give you; to wit, that I had written to Mr. Macaulay,\r\nand only waited his answer. About two months since, I received it. I\r\nhave been the greater part of the time out of town on indispensable\r\nbusiness. In the intervals I have been occupied about objects of\r\nimmediate and absolute necessity, which could not have been delayed\r\nwithout letting my business run into utter confusion. Mr. Macaulay’s\r\nconcerns have been hanging upon my spirits. I have been promising\r\nmyself, from day to day, to bring them to a conclusion; but more\r\npressing objects have unavoidably postponed it. I thought the delay\r\nrequired some apology to Mr. Macaulay, but I never dreamt of having\r\ngiven occasion of offence to you.\r\n\r\nI will not, however, deny, upon a review of what has passed, that there\r\nhave been, through hurry and inadvertency on my part, appearances\r\nof neglect towards you; but between gentlemen and men of business,\r\nunfavorable conclusions ought not to be drawn before explanations are\r\nasked. Allowances ought to be made for the situations of parties; and\r\nthe omissions of men, deeply involved in business, ought rather to be\r\nascribed to that cause than to ill intentions.\r\n\r\nHad you, in the first instance, expressed to me (in such a manner\r\nas respect for yourself and delicacy to me dictated) your sense of\r\nthese appearances, I should have taken pains to satisfy you that\r\nnothing improper towards you was intended by me. But to make one of\r\nmy clerks the instrument of communication, and the bearer to me of a\r\nharsh accusation, was ill-judged and ungenteel. To take it for granted\r\nthat you had received an injury from me, without first giving me an\r\nopportunity of an explanation, and to couch your sense of it in terms\r\nso offensive as some of those used in your letter, is an additional\r\ninstance of precipitation and rudeness.\r\n\r\nInadvertencies susceptible of misapprehension, I may commit; but I\r\nam incapable of intending to wound or injure any man who has given\r\nme no cause for it; and I am incapable of doing any thing, sir, of\r\nwhich I need be ashamed. The intimation, on your part, is unmerited\r\nand unwarrantable. After thus having explained my own conduct to\r\nyou, and given you my ideas of yours, it will depend on yourself how\r\nfar I shall be indifferent, or not, to your future sentiments of my\r\ncharacter. I shall only add, that to-morrow you shall receive from me\r\nmy determination on the matter of business between us.\r\n\r\n                                      I am, with due consideration, Sir,\r\n                                      Your most obedient servant,\r\n                                      A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo John Wilkes, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILKES TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       November 9, 1785.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nThe moment I received yours, I perceived the precipitancy of my own\r\nconduct, and was very sorry I had so far mistaken both our characters\r\nto act in the manner I have done. I flatter myself, that the same\r\ncandor which has dictated yours, will be exerted towards mine, and\r\nthat you will only view it as the act of a man who conceived himself\r\ninjured. As you have never experienced the cruel reverses of fortune,\r\nyou can scarcely judge how the least insinuations to their prejudice\r\nwill affect those persons who have; or how much more suspicious they\r\nare of the behavior of mankind towards them.\r\n\r\nThe morning I left the message for you, I had been called upon by one\r\nof the creditors of Mr. Heart, who thought it very strange no dividend\r\nwas made; and he insinuated, some party must be interested in the\r\ndelay. It is the first money transaction I have engaged in since my\r\nrelease. I felt the insinuation as alluding to me, and with a force,\r\nwhich, perhaps, I should not. However, that moment I went to your\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, when I saw your note to Mr. Atkinson, and found\r\nmyself totally set aside in a business where I had, most undoubtedly,\r\nbeen originally neglected, I felt myself very much agitated; and in\r\nthat frame of mind I wrote my last to you.\r\n\r\nSo much I thought it necessary to add in explanation.\r\n\r\nI am convinced, now, I have been too hasty; and I am sorry for it. It\r\nwill put me on my guard in future, and I make no doubt prove beneficial\r\nto me, provided it has not been the means of hurting me in your\r\nestimation, which I am now more desirous than ever of obtaining.\r\n\r\n                                              I am, Sir, with respect,\r\n                                              Your much obliged,\r\n                                              And most obedient servant,\r\n                                              John Wilkes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Colonel Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                      November 23, 1785.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nMajor Fairly is just setting out on a visit to you, I believe on some\r\nbusiness relating to the Cincinnati. The society of this State met some\r\nshort time since, and took into consideration the proposed alterations\r\nin the original frame of the Institution: some were strenuous for\r\nadhering to the old Constitution, a few for adopting the new, and many\r\nfor a middle line. This disagreement of opinion, and the consideration\r\nthat the different State societies pursuing different courses--some\r\nadopting the alterations entire; others rejecting them in the same way;\r\nothers adopting in part and rejecting in part--might beget confusion\r\nand defeat good purposes, induced a proposal, which was unanimously\r\nagreed to, that a committee should be appointed to prepare and lay\r\nbefore the society, a circular letter, expressive of the sense of\r\nthe society on the different alterations proposed, and recommending\r\nthe giving powers to a general meeting of the Cincinnati, to make\r\nsuch alterations as might be thought advisable, to obviate objections\r\nand promote the interests of the society. I believe there will be no\r\ndifficulty in agreeing to change the present mode of continuing the\r\nsociety; but it appears to be the wish of our members, that some other\r\nmode may be defined and substituted, and that it might not be left to\r\nthe uncertainty of legislative provision. We object, too, to putting\r\nthe funds under legislative direction. Indeed, it appears to us, the\r\nLegislatures will not, at present, be inclined to give us any sanction.\r\n\r\nI am of the committee: and I cannot but flatter myself, that when the\r\nobject is better digested, and more fully explained, it will meet your\r\napprobation.\r\n\r\nThe poor _Baron_ is still soliciting Congress, and has every prospect\r\nof indigence before him. He has his imprudences; but, upon the whole,\r\nhe has rendered valuable services; and his merits and the reputation of\r\nthe country, alike, demand that he should not be left to suffer want.\r\n\r\nIf there could be any mode by which your influence could be employed in\r\nhis favor, by writing to your friends in Congress, or otherwise, the\r\nBaron and his friends would be under great obligations to you.\r\n\r\n                                            I have the honor to be,\r\n                                            With sincere esteem,\r\n                                            Your ob’t and humble serv’t,\r\n                                            Alex. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nTo His Excellency General Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Mount Vernon, December 11, 1785.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nI have been favored with your letter of the twenty-third of November,\r\nby Major Fairly.\r\n\r\nSincerely do I wish that the several State societies had, or would\r\nadopt the alterations that were recommended by the general meeting, in\r\nMay, seventeen hundred and eighty-four. I then thought, and have had no\r\ncause since to change my opinion, that if the society of the Cincinnati\r\nmean to live in peace with the rest of their fellow-citizens, they must\r\nsubscribe to the alterations which were at that time adopted.\r\n\r\nThat the jealousies of, and prejudices against, this society, were\r\ncarried to an unwarrantable length, I will readily grant; and that\r\n_less_ than was done, _ought_ to have removed the fears which had been\r\nimbibed, I am as clear in, as I am that it would not have done it.\r\nBut it is a matter of little moment, whether the alarm which seized\r\nthe public mind was the result of foresight, envy, and jealousy, or\r\na disordered imagination: the effect of perseverance would have been\r\nthe same. Wherein, then, would have been found an equivalent for the\r\nseparation of interests which (from my best information, not from one\r\nState only, but many) would inevitably have taken place?\r\n\r\nThe fears of the people are not yet removed; they only sleep; and a\r\nvery little matter will set them afloat again. Had it not been for\r\nthe predicament we stood in with respect to the foreign officers and\r\nthe charitable part of the Institution, I should, on that occasion,\r\nas far as my voice would have gone, have endeavored to convince the\r\nnarrow-minded part of our countrymen, that the _amor patriæ_ was much\r\nstronger in our breasts than theirs, and that our conduct, through\r\nthe whole of the business, was actuated by nobler and more generous\r\nsentiments than were apprehended, by abolishing the society at once,\r\nwith a declaration of the causes, and the purity of its intention. But\r\nthe latter may be interesting to many, and the former is an insuperable\r\nbar to such a step.\r\n\r\nI am sincerely concerned to find, by your letter, that the Baron is\r\nagain in straitened circumstances. I am much disinclined to ask favors\r\nof Congress; but if I knew what the object of his wishes are, I should\r\nhave much pleasure in rendering him any service in my power, with such\r\nmembers of that body as I now and then correspond with. I had flattered\r\nmyself, from what was told me some time ago, that Congress had made a\r\nfinal settlement with the Baron much to his satisfaction.\r\n\r\n                                      I am, dear Sir,\r\n                                      Your most obedient humble servant,\r\n                                      G. Washington.\r\n\r\nTo Alex. Hamilton, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO NATHANIEL HAZARD.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                         April 24, 1786.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nYour letter of the twenty-first was only delivered me this morning. The\r\ngood opinion of liberal men I hold in too high estimation not to be\r\nflattered by that part of your letter which relates to me personally.\r\nThe other part I have communicated to General Schuyler, and he assures\r\nme he will see all his friends this afternoon upon the subject; so that\r\nI have no doubt, as far as his influence extends, it will be employed\r\nin favor of the success of the bill in the Assembly, as it has already\r\nbeen in the Senate.\r\n\r\nIn taking this step, however, I would not be understood to declare\r\nany opinion concerning the principles of the bill, with which I am\r\nnot sufficiently acquainted to form a decided opinion. I have merely\r\nmade your letter the occasion of introducing the subject to General\r\nSchuyler, whose sentiments are as favorable to your wishes as you could\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\nI make this observation from that spirit of candor which I hope will\r\nalways direct my conduct. I am aware that I have been represented as\r\nan enemy to the wishes of what you call your corps. If by this has\r\nbeen meant that I do not feel as much as any man, not immediately\r\ninterested, for the distresses of those merchants who have been in\r\na great measure the victims of the Revolution, the supposition does\r\nnot do justice either to my head or my heart. But if it means that I\r\nhave always viewed the mode of relieving them as a matter of peculiar\r\ndelicacy and difficulty, it is well founded.\r\n\r\nI should have thought it unnecessary to enter into this explanation,\r\nwere it not that I am held up as a candidate at the ensuing election;\r\nand I would not wish that the step I have taken, in respect to your\r\nletter, should be considered as implying more than it does; for I would\r\nnever wish to conciliate at the expense of candor. On the other hand,\r\nI confide in your liberality not to infer more than I intend from the\r\nexplanation I have given; and hope you will believe me to be, with\r\ngreat cordiality and esteem,\r\n\r\n                                                  Dear Sir,\r\n                                                  Your obedient servant,\r\n                                                  A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Hazard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCUSHING, DANA, AND BRECK TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      New-York, Sept. 10, 1786.\r\n\r\nGentlemen:\r\n\r\nUnderstanding, on our arrival in this city last Friday evening, that\r\nyou had gone on for the Convention at Annapolis the week past, we\r\ntake the liberty to acquaint you, and beg you to communicate to the\r\nConvention, if it should be opened before we arrive there, that we\r\nshall set off from this place to-morrow to join them, as Commissioners\r\nfrom the State of Massachusetts, which we hope to do in the course of\r\nthis week. The Commissioners from Philadelphia were to sail from thence\r\nfor this city, on the seventh instant, so that they may be expected\r\nsoon after us.\r\n\r\n                                     With great respect,\r\n                                     Your most obedient humble servants,\r\n                                     Thomas Cushing.\r\n                                     F. T. H. Dana.\r\n                                     Saml. Breck.\r\n\r\n  The Gentlemen\r\n  Commissioners for New-York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLA FAYETTE TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                         Paris, April 12, 1787.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Hamilton:\r\n\r\nIt is an age since I heard from you. Of you I hear by some of our\r\nfriends, and in the newspapers. But although I have a right to\r\ncomplain, I want to let you know the proceedings of our Assembly,\r\nwhich, as it is unusual in France, may raise your curiosity.\r\n\r\nOur Constitution is pretty much what it was in England before it had\r\nbeen fairly written down and minutely preserved; so that we have great\r\nclaims to freedom, to a National Representation, to the denial of\r\ntaxes, &c., &c. But disposition on one hand, and levity on the other\r\nhave manœuvred us out of almost every privilege. They will still\r\nsubsist, however, more or less, in some provinces, and particularly in\r\nthose of Bretagne.\r\n\r\nNow that the follies of Courts had obliged Government to saddle us with\r\nnew taxes, and the opposition of our magistrates did present itself\r\nas an obstacle to the ministers, they have thought proper to call an\r\nAssembly of Notables, chosen by the king, but taken among the first\r\npeople in _each_ order, and to begin with granting them what is more\r\nwished for by the nation, an Assembly in each Province.\r\n\r\nThe last Assembly of Notables, in 1626, had been obedient to the\r\nministers. This one came at a more enlightened period. It happened\r\nunder a minister, who, although he has parts, is not equal to some of\r\nthe members--men of fine abilities. We are backed by the nation, and\r\nalthough not her representatives, have behaved as her interpreters, and\r\nwe have formed a great majority in favor of popular measures.\r\n\r\nThe speeches from the throne, those of M. de Calonne, have been\r\nprinted: the last one contains many falsehoods. The first measure\r\nwe took was for the clergy to declare they were ready to pay in the\r\nsame proportion with other people, for the Noblesse to make the same\r\ndeclaration, and reject a pecuniary privilege that was offered, in lieu\r\nof the other that is taken off.\r\n\r\nWe have gratefully accepted the provincial elective assemblies, but\r\nhave united on such alterations as will invigorate them. M. de Calonne\r\nhad made a mixture of democracy and despotism which did annihilate\r\nthose checks and gradations that are necessary evils, wherever there is\r\na king. But I think the provincial assemblies, as they are proposed by\r\nus, may lay a foundation for a good building.\r\n\r\nSeveral plans for the removal of internal Custom offices, for the\r\nfree exportation of corn, for the change in the salt tax, for the\r\nannihilation of some duties, and now for the disposal of the king’s\r\ndomanial possessions, have been examined, and underwent several\r\nalterations. To some we have only left the titles of the chapters, but\r\nchanged them, in my opinion, much for the better.\r\n\r\nThe idea of a general tax in kind, was proposed by the government,\r\nbut we said it was not practicable. As to any new imposition, we have\r\nanswered, it is impossible to form an opinion before we know the return\r\nof the exports of the two last years, and the plans of economy that\r\nare intended. We have not, it is true, any powers from the nation,\r\nbut our opinion is asked, and in a measure has become necessary, and\r\na majority of us do not think their opinion can be given, until those\r\npreliminaries are fulfilled.\r\n\r\nThere is a very interesting contrast between the king’s power at\r\nVersailles, and the opposition of that Assembly which is held there,\r\nand divided in seven committees of twenty, or twenty-two each, presided\r\nby a prince of the blood. Hitherto we have not voted in a General\r\nAssembly, although we had some to hear the Minister. But the opinions\r\nof the committees only are now taken, and in the end each vote will be\r\npronounced in the whole house, beginning from the last up to the first\r\nin rank. You know that we have the Clergy, Magistracy, Noblesse, and\r\nTiers Etat.\r\n\r\nAt the last meeting we had before the recess of these holidays, I had\r\na personal battle of some importance. The king’s domanial property has\r\nbeen a pretence to lavish money on the princes of the blood, favorites,\r\nand the powerful people of the country. I had the day before moved for\r\nan examination of those bargains, wherein more than fifty millions have\r\nbeen thrown away. The great people being afraid of being found out,\r\nand particularly M. de Calonne, who is guilty of the most indecent\r\ndepredation, thought they must intimidate me and the Bishop of Langres,\r\nM. de la Luzerne’s brother, who had seconded my motion. They, in\r\nconsequence of it, persuaded the king to have us told by his brother,\r\nour president, that such motions ought to be signed. Upon which, we\r\nsigned the inclosed paper; and the bishop said, that after the rents,\r\nhe would bring in some accounts, signed by him, of the bargain of\r\nsinecure, made by M. de Calonne. The king was very angry with me; M.\r\nde Calonne, who had his confidence, intended signal revenge. I was\r\npreparing to support what I had said, when we suddenly heard that M. de\r\nCalonne had been dismissed. The keeper of the seal was also sent off.\r\nI am glad we got rid of M. de Calonne; and with his successor, who,\r\nunfortunately, is an old broken man, may improve the opportunity of\r\nthis Assembly, and let us make useful arrangements.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my dear Hamilton; my best respects wait on Mrs. Hamilton.\r\nRemember me to Gen. Knox, Wadsworth--all our friends, and particularly\r\nthe good doctor.\r\n\r\n                                              Most affectionately yours,\r\n                                              La Fayette.\r\n\r\nP. S. Don’t tell the French Chargé d’Affairs that you have this paper\r\nfrom me, except that there is nothing in it, for topics have spread\r\nevery _where_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        New-York, July 3, 1787.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nIn my passage through the Jerseys, and since my arrival here, I have\r\ntaken particular pains to discover the public sentiment, and I am\r\nmore and more convinced that this is the critical opportunity for\r\nestablishing the prosperity of this country on a solid foundation. I\r\nhave conversed with men of information, not only of this city, but from\r\ndifferent parts of the State; and they agree that there has been an\r\nastonishing revolution for the better in the minds of the people.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing apprehension among thinking men is, that the Convention,\r\nfrom the fear of shocking the popular opinion, will not go far enough.\r\nThey seem to be convinced, that a strong, well-mounted government will\r\nbetter suit the popular palate, than one of a different complexion.\r\nMen in office are, indeed, taking all possible pains to give an\r\nunfavorable impression of the Convention; but the current seems to be\r\nmoving strongly the other way.\r\n\r\nA plain, but sensible man, in a conversation I had with him yesterday,\r\nexpressed himself nearly in this manner:--The people begin to be\r\nconvinced that “their excellent form of government,” as they have been\r\nused to call it, will not answer their purpose, and that they must\r\nsubstitute something not very remote from that which they have lately\r\nquitted.\r\n\r\nThese appearances, though they will not warrant a conclusion that\r\nthe people are yet ripe for such a plan as I advocate, yet serve to\r\nprove that there is no reason to despair of their adopting one equally\r\nenergetic, if the Convention should think proper to propose it. They\r\nserve to prove that we ought not to allow too much weight to objections\r\ndrawn from the supposed repugnance of the people to an efficient\r\nconstitution. I confess, I am more and more inclined to believe, that\r\nformer habits of thinking are regaining their influence with more\r\nrapidity than is generally imagined.\r\n\r\nNot having compared ideas with you, sir, I cannot judge how far our\r\nsentiments agree; but, as I persuade myself, the genuineness of my\r\nrepresentations will receive credit with you. My anxiety for the\r\nevent of the deliberations of the Convention, induces me to make this\r\ncommunication of what appears to be the tendency of the public mind.\r\n\r\nI own to you, sir, that I am seriously and deeply distressed at the\r\naspect of the counsels which prevailed when I left Philadelphia. I fear\r\nthat we shall let slip the golden opportunity of rescuing the American\r\nEmpire from disunion, anarchy, and misery.\r\n\r\nNo motley or feeble measure can answer the end, or will finally receive\r\nthe public support. Decision is true wisdom, and will be not less\r\nreputable to the Convention, than salutary to the community.\r\n\r\nI shall of necessity remain here ten or twelve days. If I have reason\r\nto believe that my attendance at Philadelphia will not be mere waste of\r\ntime, I shall, after that period, rejoin the Convention.\r\n\r\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Philadelphia, 10th July, 1787.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nI thank you for your communication of the 3d. When I refer you to the\r\nstate of the councils which prevailed at the period you left this city,\r\nand add that they are now, if possible, in a worse train than ever; you\r\nwill find but little ground on which the hope of a good establishment\r\ncan be formed. In a word, I _almost_ despair of seeing a favorable\r\nissue to the proceedings of the Convention, and do, therefore, repent\r\nhaving any agency in the business.\r\n\r\nThe men who oppose a strong and energetic government are in my opinion\r\nnarrow-minded politicians, or are under the influence of local views.\r\nThe apprehension expressed by them, that the _people_ will not accede\r\nto the form proposed, is the _ostensible_, not the _real_, cause of\r\nthe opposition; but admitting that the _present_ sentiment is as they\r\nprognosticate, the question ought nevertheless to be, is it or is it\r\nnot the best form? If the former, recommend it, and it will assuredly\r\nobtain, maugre opposition.\r\n\r\nI am sorry you went away; I wish you were back. The crisis is equally\r\nimportant and alarming, and no opposition under such circumstances\r\nshould discourage exertions, till the signature is fixed. I will not at\r\nthis time trouble you with more than my best wishes and sincere regards.\r\n\r\n                                                 I am, dear Sir,\r\n                                                 Your obedient servant,\r\n                                                 G. Washington.\r\n\r\nAlexander Hamilton, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO ----\r\n\r\n\r\n                                          New-York, ----, 1787.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nAgreeably to what passed between us, I have had an interview with Mr.\r\nAuldjo, and I flatter myself if there is (as I doubt not there will\r\nbe) as much moderation on the part of Major Peirce as there appears\r\nto be on that of Mr. Auldjo, that the affair between them may yet be\r\namicably terminated.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Auldjo observes, I confess in my opinion with propriety, that\r\nhe ought to know with some precision the matters which have given\r\noffence to Major Peirce, before he can enter into explanations; which\r\nhe declares himself to be very ready to do with coolness and candor,\r\nthe moment he shall be enabled to do it by a specification of the\r\nsubjects of complaint. If a personal interview is for any reason\r\ndisagreeable to Major Peirce, I entreat you, my dear sir, to obtain\r\nfrom him, and to communicate to me by letter, the substance of what has\r\noccasioned his dissatisfaction, with so much particularity only as will\r\nput it in the power of Mr. Auldjo to give an explicit answer. Major\r\nPeirce will, I hope, have no scruples about this, for as the door of\r\nexplanation has been opened by Mr. Auldjo, there is no punctilio which\r\nstands in his way; and I trust he will feel the force of a sentiment\r\nwhich prudence and humanity equally dictate, that extremities ought\r\nthen only to ensue when, after a fair experiment, accommodation has\r\nbeen found impracticable. An attention to this principle interests the\r\ncharacters of both the gentlemen concerned, and with them our own; and\r\nfrom every other consideration, as well as that of personal friendship\r\nto the parties, I sincerely wish to give it its full operation. I am\r\nconvinced you are not less anxious to effect this than myself; and I\r\ntrust our joint endeavors will not prove unsuccessful.\r\n\r\n                                        I remain with sincere regard,\r\n                                        Dear Sir, your obedient servant,\r\n                                        Alex. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nI cannot, however, conclude without making one remark. Though Mr.\r\nAuldjo has expressed and still entertains a desire of explanation,\r\nit would ill become him to solicit it. Whatever, therefore, in my\r\nexpressions may seem to urge such an explanation with the earnestness\r\nof entreaty, must be ascribed to my own feelings, and to that\r\ninclination which every man of sensibility must feel, not to see\r\nextremities take place if it be in his power to prevent them, or until\r\nthey become an absolutely necessary sacrifice to public opinion.\r\n\r\n                                        I remain with sincere regard,\r\n                                        Dear Sir, your obedient servant,\r\n                                        A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO AULDJO.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       New-York, July 26, 1787.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nI have delivered the paper you committed to me, as it stood altered, to\r\nMajor Peirce, from whose conduct I am to conclude the affair between\r\nyou is at an end. He informs me that he is shortly to set out on a\r\njaunt up the North River.\r\n\r\nAs you intimate a wish to have my sentiments in writing on the\r\ntransaction, I shall with pleasure declare that the steps you have\r\ntaken in consequence of Mr. Peirce’s challenge have been altogether\r\nin conformity to my opinion of what would be prudent, proper, and\r\nhonorable on your part. They seem to have satisfied Mr. Peirce’s\r\nscruples arising from what he apprehended in some particulars to have\r\nbeen your conduct to him, and I presume we are to hear nothing further\r\nof the matter.\r\n\r\n                                       I remain with great esteem, Sir,\r\n                                       Your obedient and humble servant,\r\n                                       Alex.

I will also be obliged to you to let me know when\r\nyour conclusion is at hand, for I would choose to be present at that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO WADSWORTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                        August 20, 1787.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir:\r\n\r\nThe inclosed is said to be the copy of a letter circulating in your\r\nState. The history of its appearance among us is, that it was sent\r\nby one _Whitmore_ of Stratford, formerly in the Paymaster General’s\r\noffice, to one James Reynolds of this city.\r\n\r\nI am at a loss clearly to understand its object, and have some\r\nsuspicion, that it has been fabricated to excite jealousy against the\r\nConvention, with a view to an opposition to their recommendations. At\r\nall events, I wish, if possible, to trace its source, and send it to\r\nyou for that purpose.\r\n\r\nWhitmore must of course say where he got it, and by pursuing the\r\ninformation we may at last come at the author. Let me know the\r\npolitical connections of this man, and the complexion of the people\r\nmost active in the circulation of the letter. Be so good as to attend\r\nto this inquiry somewhat particularly, as I have different reasons of\r\nsome moment for setting it on foot.\r\n\r\n                                                   I remain, &c.\r\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nTo Jeremiah Wadsworth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOL. WADSWORTH TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     Hartford, August 26, 1787.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir:\r\n\r\nI received your favor this day, with the inclosed copy of a letter,\r\nsaid to be circulating in this State. Some time since a paragraph\r\nin the New Haven papers hinted at such a letter, and appeared to be\r\nwritten to secure the Anti-federal party or alarm them. And I believed\r\nit was well intended, as it seemed to be meant to prepare them to\r\ncomply with the doings of the Convention, lest worse befell them; but\r\nthe close of the letter appears to be calculated for other purposes.\r\nWetmore has always associated with men who wished well to America, and\r\na good Government. He is half-brother to the spirited Federal writer\r\nin our papers, who signs himself Cato; and if he has really written\r\nor circulated the letter in question, I am quite at a loss to know\r\nhis intentions. I have communicated this matter to Col. Humphreys, in\r\nconfidence, who is on his way to New Haven, where Wetmore lives, though\r\nformerly of Hartford. He will inquire carefully into the matter, and\r\nwrite you. He has lived in the same town with Wetmore, and can easily\r\nfathom him. Wetmore is naturally sanguine, has some talents, and I\r\nbelieve, is enterprising, but fickle. Who the active people in this\r\nbusiness are, I have yet to learn, as it certainly has not circulated\r\nhereabouts. But from Humphreys you may expect to know all that is\r\ntrue, in Wetmore’s neighborhood. I have always been Humphreys’ friend,\r\nbut a nearer acquaintance with him convinces me he is a man of great\r\nintegrity, and such talents as would wear well in any employment of\r\nconfidence. If he comes to New-York I wish you to be more acquainted\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\n                                               I am, dear Sir,\r\n                                               Your very humble servant,\r\n                                               Jerh. Wadsworth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO RUFUS KING.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     New-York, August 28, 1787.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nI wrote you, some days since, to request you to inform me when there\r\nwas a prospect of your finishing, as I intended to be with you, for\r\ncertain reasons, before the conclusion. It is whispered here, that some\r\nlate changes in your scheme have taken place, which give it a higher\r\ntone. Is this the case? I leave town to-day to attend a circuit in a\r\nneighboring county, from which I shall return the last of the week, and\r\nshall be glad to find a line from you, explanatory of the period of the\r\nprobable termination of your business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLONEL HUMPHREYS TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     New Haven, Sept. 16, 1787.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir:\r\n\r\nOur friend Col. Wadsworth has communicated to me a letter, in which\r\nyou made inquiries respecting a political letter that has lately\r\ncirculated in this State. I arrived in this town yesterday, and have\r\nsince conversed with several intelligent persons on the subject. It\r\nappears to have been printed in a Fairfield paper as long ago as the\r\n25th of July. I have not been able to trace it to its source. Mr.\r\nWetmore informs me, that when he first saw this letter it was in the\r\nhands of one Jared Mansfield, who, I believe, has formerly been reputed\r\na Loyalist. Indeed it seems to have been received and circulated with\r\navidity by that class of people, whether it was fabricated by them or\r\nnot. I think, however, there is little doubt that it was manufactured\r\nin this State. I demanded of Mr. Wetmore what he thought were the\r\nwishes and objects of the writer of that letter. He said, he believed\r\nit might be written principally for the amusement of the author, and\r\nperhaps with some view to learn whether the people were not absolutely\r\nindifferent to all government and dead to all political sentiment.\r\n\r\nBefore I saw the letter in question, a paragraph had been published\r\nby Mr. Meigs, giving an account of it, and attempting to excite the\r\napprehensions of the Anti-federalists, with an idea, that the most\r\ndisastrous consequences are to be expected, unless we shall accept the\r\nproceedings of the Convention. Some think this was the real design of\r\nthe fictitious performance, but others, with more reason, that it was\r\nintended to feel the public pulse, and to discover whether the public\r\nmind would be startled with propositions of Royalty. The quondam tories\r\nhave undoubtedly conceived hopes of a future union with Great Britain,\r\nfrom the inefficacy of our Government, and the tumults which prevailed\r\nin Massachusetts during the last winter. I saw a letter, written at\r\nthat period, by a Clergyman of considerable reputation in Nova Scotia,\r\nto a person of eminence in this State, stating the impossibility of our\r\nbeing happy under our present Constitution, and proposing (now we could\r\nthink and argue calmly on all the consequences) that the efforts of the\r\nmoderate, the virtuous, and the brave, should be exerted to effect a\r\nreunion with the parent State. He mentioned, among other things, how\r\ninstrumental the Cincinnati might be, and how much it would redound to\r\ntheir emolument. It seems, by a conversation I have had here, that the\r\nultimate practicability of introducing the Bishop of Osnaburgh is not a\r\nnovel idea among those who were formerly termed Loyalists. Ever since\r\nthe peace it has been occasionally talked of and wished for. Yesterday,\r\nwhere I dined, half jest--half earnest--he was given as the first toast.\r\n\r\nI leave you now, my dear friend, to reflect how ripe we are for the\r\nmost mad and ruinous project that can be suggested, especially when,\r\nin addition to this view, we take into consideration how thoroughly\r\nthe patriotic part of the community--the friends of an efficient\r\nGovernment, are discouraged with the present system, and irritated at\r\nthe popular demagogues who are determined to keep themselves in office,\r\nat the risk of every thing. Thence apprehensions are formed, that\r\nthough the measures proposed by the Convention, may not be equal to the\r\nwishes of the most enlightened and virtuous, yet that they will be too\r\nhigh-toned to be adopted by our popular assemblies. Should that happen,\r\nour political ship will be left afloat on a sea of chance, without a\r\nrudder as well as without a pilot.\r\n\r\nI am happy to see you have (some of you) had the honest boldness\r\nto attack in a public paper, the Anti-federal dogmas of a great\r\npersonage in your State. Go on and prosper. Were the men of talents\r\nand honesty, throughout the Continent, properly combined into one\r\nphalanx, I am confident they would be competent to hew their way\r\nthrough all opposition. Were there no little jealousies, bickerings\r\nand unworthy sinister views, to divert them from their object, they\r\nmight by perseverance, establish a Government calculated to promote the\r\nhappiness of mankind, and to make the Revolution a blessing instead of\r\na curse.\r\n\r\nI think it is probable that I shall soon go to the southward; in the\r\nmean time, I beg you to be persuaded that I am, with sentiments of\r\nsincere friendship and esteem,\r\n\r\n                              My dear Hamilton,\r\n                              Your most obedient and most humble serv’t,\r\n                              D. Humphreys.\r\n\r\nCol. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                   1787.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nYou probably saw, some time since, some animadversions on certain\r\nexpressions of Governor Clinton, respecting the Convention. You may\r\nhave seen a piece, signed “A Republican,” attempting to bring the fact\r\ninto question, and endeavoring to controvert the conclusions drawn from\r\nit, if true. My answer you will find in the inclosed. I trouble you\r\nwith it merely from that anxiety, which is natural to every man, to\r\nhave his veracity at least stand in a fair light. The matter seems to\r\nbe given up by the Governor, and the fact, with the inferences from it,\r\nstand against him in full force, and operate as they ought to do.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, of some importance to the party to diminish whatever\r\ncredit or influence I may possess, and to effect this, they stick at\r\nnothing. Among many contemptible artifices practised by them, they\r\nhave had recourse to an insinuation, that I _palmed_ myself upon you,\r\nand that you _dismissed_ me from your family. This I confess hurts my\r\nfeelings, and if it obtains credit, will require a contradiction. You,\r\nsir, will undoubtedly recollect the manner in which I came into your\r\nfamily, and went out of it; and know how destitute of foundation such\r\ninsinuations are. My confidence in your justice will not permit me to\r\ndoubt your readiness to put the matter in its true light in your answer\r\nto this letter. It cannot be my wish to give any complexion to the\r\naffair which might excite the least scruple in you; but I confess it\r\nwould mortify me to lie under the imputation, either of having obtruded\r\nmyself into the family of a General, or of having been turned out of it.\r\n\r\nThe new Constitution is as popular in this city as it is possible\r\nfor any thing to be, and the prospect thus far is favorable to it\r\nthroughout the State. But there is no saying what turn things may take\r\nwhen the full flood of official influence is let loose against it. This\r\nis to be expected; for though the Governor has not publicly declared\r\nhimself, his particular connections and confidential friends are loud\r\nagainst it.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hamilton joins in respectful compliments to Mrs. Washington.\r\n\r\n                                     I remain with perfect esteem,\r\n                                     Your Excellency’s obedient servant,\r\n                                     A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLA FAYETTE TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       Paris, October 15, 1787.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Hamilton:\r\n\r\nWhile you have been attending your most important Convention, debates\r\nwere also going on in France respecting the constitutional rights, and\r\nmatters of that kind. Grave reforms are taking place at court. The\r\nparliaments are remonstrating, and our provincial assemblies begin to\r\npop out. Amidst many things that were not much to the purpose, some\r\ngood principles have been laid out; and, although our affairs have\r\na proper arrangement, the nation will not in the last be the loser.\r\nThe prime minister is a man of candor, honesty, and abilities. But\r\nnow the rumor of war sets us a-going. Not that France is wishing for\r\nit, and Great Britain ought to be satisfied with an advantageous\r\ntreaty of commerce, and the profit of hers and Prussia’s treachery in\r\nHolland. But, while I consider the madness of the Turks, the movements\r\nof the Imperial Court, the folly of his Prussian Majesty, the late\r\ncatastrophe in Holland, and the cry of England for war, I hardly think\r\nthat the peaceful dispositions of this ministry--and, they say, of\r\nMr. Pitt--will be able to extinguish a fire that is catching in every\r\ncorner of Europe. It would be consistent with my inclination and best\r\nviews that America be engaged in an active co-operation. But as I do\r\nnot think it consistent with her interest, I have taken the liberty\r\nto express my ideas in an official letter to Mr. Jay, to whom I refer\r\nyou. It seems to me, that a friendly, helping neutrality, would be\r\nuseful to France, profitable to the United States, and perfectly safe\r\non the footing of the treaties. Should America be forced to war, I wish\r\nit would be for the last campaign--time enough to occupy Canada and\r\nNewfoundland. But I see no inconvenience in privateering with French\r\nletters of marque.\r\n\r\nInclosed is the journal of a preliminary assembly in Auvergne. I am\r\nreturning there as soon as we have done some arrangements respecting\r\nAmerican commerce, which will result on as good footing in this kingdom\r\nas it is for the moment possible. The ministry are more favorably\r\ndisposed.\r\n\r\nI hope you will be satisfied with Count de Maurice and the Countess\r\nde Brehan, his sister-in-law. I beg leave to introduce them both to\r\nyou and Mrs. Hamilton, to whom I offer my most affectionate regards.\r\nRemember me to the rest of the family and all friends. My best\r\ncompliments wait on Gen. Schuyler and the doctor. Adieu, my good\r\nfriend. The post is going to town. I have only time to tell that I am\r\never\r\n\r\n                                          Your most affectionate friend,\r\n                                          La Fayette.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Mount Vernon, October 18, 1787.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nYour favor, without date, came to my hand by the last post. It is\r\nwith unfeigned concern I perceive that a political dispute has arisen\r\nbetween Gov. Clinton and yourself. For both of you I have the highest\r\nesteem and regard. But as you say it is insinuated by some of your\r\npolitical adversaries, and may obtain credit, “that you _palmed_\r\nyourself upon me and was _dismissed_ from my family,” and call upon\r\nme to do you justice by a recital of the facts; I do, therefore,\r\nexplicitly declare, that both charges are entirely unfounded. With\r\nrespect to the first, I have no cause to believe that you took a\r\nsingle step to accomplish, or had the most distant idea of receiving\r\nan appointment in my family till you were invited thereto. And with\r\nrespect to the second, that your quitting it was altogether the effect\r\nof your own choice.\r\n\r\nWhen the situation of this country calls loudly for unanimity and\r\nvigor, it is to be lamented that gentlemen of talent and character\r\nshould disagree in their sentiments for promoting the public weal; but\r\nunfortunately this ever has been, and more than probable ever will be,\r\nthe case in the affairs of man.\r\n\r\nHaving scarcely been from home since my return from Philadelphia, I can\r\ngive but little information with respect to the _general_ reception of\r\nthe new constitution in _this_ State. In Alexandria, however, and some\r\nof the adjacent counties, it has been embraced with an enthusiastic\r\nwarmth of which I had no conception. I expect, notwithstanding, violent\r\nopposition will be given to it by _some_ characters of weight and\r\ninfluence in the State.\r\n\r\nMrs. Washington unites with me in sending her best wishes for Mrs.\r\nHamilton and yourself.\r\n\r\n                             I am, dear Sir,\r\n                             Your most obedient and affectionate friend,\r\n                             G. Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       October 30, 1787.\r\n\r\nI am much obliged to your Excellency for the explicit manner in which\r\nyou contradict the insinuations mentioned in my last letter. The only\r\nuse I shall make of your answer will be to put it into the hands of a\r\nfew friends.\r\n\r\nThe constitution proposed has in this State warm friends, and warm\r\nenemies. The first impressions every where are in its favor; but the\r\nartillery of its opponents makes some impression. The event cannot yet\r\nbe foreseen. The inclosed is the first number of a series of papers to\r\nbe written in its defence.\r\n\r\nI send you also, at the request of the Baron De Steuben, a printed\r\npamphlet, containing the grounds of an application lately made to\r\nCongress. He tells me there is some reference to you, the object of\r\nwhich he does not himself seem clearly to understand; but imagines it\r\nmay be in your power to be of service to him.\r\n\r\nThere are public considerations that induce me to be somewhat anxious\r\nfor his success. He is fortified with materials, which, in Europe,\r\ncould not fail to establish the belief of the contract he alleges. The\r\ndocuments of service he possesses are of a nature to convey an exalted\r\nidea of them. The compensations he has received, though considerable,\r\nif compared with those which have been received by American officers,\r\nwill, according to European ideas, be very scanty in application to\r\na stranger who is acknowledged to have rendered essential services.\r\nOur reputation abroad is not at present too high. To dismiss an old\r\nsoldier empty and hungry, to seek the bounty of those on whom he has\r\nno claims, and to complain of unkind returns and violated engagements,\r\nwill certainly not tend to raise it. I confess, too, there is something\r\nin my feelings which would incline me in this case to go farther than\r\nmight be strictly necessary, rather than drive a man, at the Baron’s\r\ntime of life, who has been a faithful servant, to extremities. And\r\nthis is unavoidable if he does not succeed in his present attempt. What\r\nhe asks would, all calculations made, terminate in this, an allowance\r\nof his five hundred and eighty guineas a year. He only wishes a\r\nrecognition of the contract. He knows that until affairs mend no money\r\ncan be produced. I do not know how far it may be in your power to do\r\nhim any good; but I shall be mistaken if the considerations I have\r\nmentioned do not appear to your Excellency to have some weight.\r\n\r\n                                I remain, with great respect and esteem,\r\n                                Your Excellency’s obedient servant,\r\n                                A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency General Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Mount Vernon, November 10, 1787.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nI thank you for the pamphlet, and for the Gazette, contained in your\r\nletter of the 30th ult. For the remaining numbers of Publius, I shall\r\nacknowledge myself obliged, as I am persuaded the subject will be well\r\nhandled by the author.\r\n\r\nThe new constitution has, as the public prints will have informed\r\nyou, been handed to the people of this State by a unanimous vote\r\nof the Assembly, but it is not to be inferred from hence that its\r\nopponents are silenced. On the contrary there are many, and some\r\npowerful ones--some of whom, it is said, by _overshooting_ the mark,\r\nhave lessened their weight; be this as it may, their assiduity stands\r\nunrivalled, whilst the friends to the constitution content themselves\r\nwith barely avowing their approbation of it. Thus stands the matter\r\nwith us at present, yet my opinion is that the major voice is favorable.\r\n\r\nApplication has been made to me by Mr. Secretary Thompson (by order\r\nof Congress), for a copy of the report of a committee, which was\r\nappointed to confer with the Baron De Steuben, on his first arrival\r\nin this country, forwarded to me by Mr. President Laurens. This I\r\nhave accordingly sent. It throws no other light on the subject than\r\nsuch as is to be derived from the disinterested conduct of the Baron.\r\nNo terms are made by him, “nor will he accept of any thing but with\r\ngeneral approbation.” I have, however, in my letter inclosing this\r\nreport to the Secretary, taken occasion to express an unequivocal wish\r\nthat Congress would reward the Baron for his services, sacrifices,\r\nand merits, to his entire satisfaction. It is the only way in which I\r\ncould bring my sentiments before that honorable body, as it has been an\r\nestablished principle with me, to ask nothing from it.\r\n\r\n                                      With very great esteem and regard,\r\n                                      I am, dear Sir,\r\n                                      Your most obedient servant,\r\n                                      G. Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO JAMES MADISON, JUNR.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       New-York, April 3, 1788.\r\n\r\nI have been very delinquent, my dear sir, in not thanking you for your\r\nletter from Philadelphia. The remarks you made on a certain subject are\r\nimportant, and will be attended to.\r\n\r\nThere is truly much embarrassment in the case.\r\n\r\nI think, however, the principles we have talked of, are not only just,\r\nbut will apply to the other departments. Nor will the consequences\r\nappear so disagreeable as they may seem at first sight, when we attend\r\nto the true import of the rule established. The States _retain_ all\r\nthe authorities they were before possessed of, not alienated in the\r\nthree modes pointed out; but this does not include cases which are\r\nthe creatures of the new Constitution. For instance, the crime of\r\ntreason against the United States _immediately_ is a crime known only\r\nto the new Constitution. There of course _was_ no power in the State\r\nconstitutions to pardon that crime. There will therefore be none under\r\nthe new, &c. This is something like, it seems to me, to afford the\r\nbest solution of the difficulty. I send you the Federalist from the\r\nbeginning to the conclusion of the commentary on the Executive Branch.\r\nIf our suspicions of the author be right, he must be too much engaged\r\nto make a rapid progress in what remains. The Court of Chancery and a\r\nCircuit Court are now sitting.\r\n\r\nWe are told that your election has succeeded, with which we all\r\nfelicitate ourselves. I will thank you for an account of the result\r\ngenerally. In this State our prospects are much as you left them. A\r\nmoot point which side will prevail. Our friends to the northward are\r\nactive.\r\n\r\n                                     I remain,\r\n                                     Your affectionate obedient servant,\r\n                                     A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                            May 4, 1788.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir:\r\n\r\nI believe I am in your debt a letter or two, which is owing to my\r\noccupation in relation to the elections, &c.\r\n\r\nThese are now over in this State, but the result is not known. All\r\ndepends upon Albany, where both sides claim the victory. Our doubts\r\nwill not be removed till the latter end of the month. I hope your\r\nexpectations of Virginia have not diminished.\r\n\r\nRespecting the first volume of Publius I have executed your commands.\r\nThe books have been sent addressed to the care of Governor Randolph.\r\nThe second, we are informed, will be out in the course of a week, and\r\nan equal number shall be forwarded. Inclosed is a letter, committed to\r\nmy care by Mr. Vanderkemp, which I forward with pleasure.\r\n\r\n                                      Believe me, with great attachment,\r\n                                      Yours,\r\n                                      A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        New-York, May 19, 1788.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir:\r\n\r\nI acknowledge my delinquency in not thanking you before for your\r\nobliging letter from Richmond. But the truth is, that I have been so\r\noverwhelmed in avocations of one kind or another, that I have scarcely\r\nhad a moment to spare to a friend. You, I trust, will be the less\r\ndisposed to be inexorable, as I hope you will believe there is no one\r\nfor whom I have more inclination than yourself--I mean of the _male_\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nYour account of the situation of Virginia was interesting, and the\r\npresent appearances, as represented here, justify your conjectures. It\r\ndoes not, however, appear that the adoption of the constitution can be\r\nconsidered as out of doubt in that State. Its conduct upon the occasion\r\nwill certainly be of critical importance.\r\n\r\nIn this State, as far as we can judge, the elections have gone wrong.\r\nThe event, however, will not certainly be known till the end of the\r\nmonth. Violence, rather than moderation, is to be looked for from the\r\nopposite party. Obstinacy seems the prevailing trait in the character\r\nof its leader. The language is, that if all the other States adopt,\r\nthis is to persist in refusing the constitution. It is reduced to a\r\ncertainty, that Clinton has in several conversations declared the\r\n_Union_ unnecessary; though I have the information through channels\r\nwhich do not permit a public use to be made of it.\r\n\r\nWe have, notwithstanding this unfavorable complexion of things, two\r\nsources of hope--one, the chance of a ratification by nine States,\r\nbefore we decide, and the influence of this upon the firmness of the\r\n_followers_; the other, the probability of a change of sentiment in the\r\npeople, auspicious to the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe current has been for some time running towards it; though the whole\r\nflood of official influence, accelerated by a torrent of falsehood,\r\nearly gave the public opinion so violent a direction in a wrong\r\nchannel, that it was not possible suddenly to alter its course. This\r\nis a mighty stiff simile; but you know what I mean; and after having\r\nstarted it, I did not choose to give up the chase.\r\n\r\n                                                 Adieu. Yours sincerely,\r\n                                                 A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Convention in this city, by a majority of nine or\r\nten to one, will be:--John Jay, Robert R. Livingston, Richard Morris,\r\nJohn Sloss Hobart, James Duane, Isaac Rosevelt, Richard Harrison,\r\nNicholas Low, Alexander Hamilton.\r\n\r\nG. Morris, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        New-York, May 19, 1788.\r\n\r\nSome days since, I wrote to you, my dear sir, inclosing a letter from a\r\nMr. Vanderkemp, &c.\r\n\r\nI then mentioned to you that the question of a majority for or against\r\nthe Constitution, would depend upon the County of Albany. By the later\r\naccounts from that quarter, I fear much that the issue there has been\r\nagainst us.\r\n\r\nAs Clinton is truly the leader of his party, and is inflexibly\r\nobstinate, I count little on overcoming opposition by reason. Our only\r\nchances will be the previous ratification by nine States, which may\r\nshake the firmness of his followers; and a change in the sentiments\r\nof the people, which have, for some time, been travelling towards the\r\nConstitution, though the first impressions, made by every species of\r\ninfluence and artifice, were too strong to be eradicated in time to\r\ngive a decisive turn to the elections. We shall leave nothing undone to\r\ncultivate a favorable disposition in the citizens at large.\r\n\r\nThe language of the Anti-federalists is, that if all the other States\r\nadopt, New-York ought still to hold out. I have the most direct\r\nintelligence, but in a manner which forbids a public use being made\r\nof it, that Clinton has, in several conversations, declared his\r\nopinion of the _inutility_ of the Union. It is an unhappy\r\nreflection, that the friends to it should, by quarrelling for straws\r\namong themselves, promote the designs of its adversaries. We think here\r\nthat the situation of your State is critical. Let me know what you\r\nnow think of it. I believe you meet nearly at the time we do. It will\r\nbe of vast importance that an exact communication should be kept up\r\nbetween us at that period; and the moment _any decisive_ question is\r\ntaken, if favorable, I request you to dispatch an express to me with\r\npointed orders to make all possible diligence, by changing horses, &c.\r\nAll expense shall be thankfully and liberally paid. I executed your\r\ncommands respecting the first volume of the Federalist. I sent forty of\r\nthe common copies and twelve of the finer ones, addressed to the care\r\nof Governor Randolph. The printer announces the second volume in a day\r\nor two, when an equal number of the two kinds shall also be forwarded.\r\nHe informs that the Judicial Department--Trial by Jury--Bill of Rights,\r\n&c., is discussed in some additional papers which have not yet appeared\r\nin the Gazettes.\r\n\r\n                                    I remain,\r\n                                    With great sincerity and attachment,\r\n                                    Yours,\r\n                                    A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nJames Madison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        New-York, June 8, 1788.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir:\r\n\r\nIn my last, I think, I informed you that the elections had turned out,\r\nbeyond expectation, favorable to the Anti-federal party. They have a\r\nmajority of two-thirds in the Convention, and, according to the best\r\nestimate I can form, of about four-sevenths in the community. The\r\nviews of the leaders in this city are pretty well ascertained to be\r\nturned towards a _long_ adjournment; say, till next spring or summer.\r\nTheir incautious ones observe, that this will give an opportunity to\r\nthe State to _see how_ the government works, and to act according to\r\n_circumstances_.\r\n\r\nMy reasonings on the fact are to this effect: The leaders of the\r\nparty hostile to the Constitution are equally hostile to the Union.\r\nThey are, however, afraid to reject the Constitution at once, because\r\nthat step would bring matters to a crisis between this State and the\r\nStates which had adopted the Constitution, and between the parties\r\nin the State. A separation of the Southern District from the other\r\nparts of the State, it is perceived, would become the object of the\r\nFederalists, and of the neighboring States. They therefore resolve upon\r\na long adjournment, as the safest and most artful course to effect\r\ntheir final purpose. They suppose, that when the Government gets into\r\noperation, it will be obliged to take some steps in respect to revenue,\r\n&c., which will furnish topics of declamation to its enemies in the\r\nseveral States, and will strengthen the minorities. If any considerable\r\ndiscontent should show itself, they will stand ready to head the\r\nopposition. If, on the contrary, the thing should go on smoothly, and\r\nthe sentiments of our own people should change, they can elect to come\r\ninto the Union. They at all events take the chances of time and the\r\nchapter of accidents.\r\n\r\nHow far their friends in the country will go with them, I am not able\r\nto say, but, as they have always been found very obsequious, we have\r\nlittle reason to calculate upon an uncompliant temper in the present\r\ninstance. For my own part, the more I can penetrate the views of the\r\nAnti-federal party in this State, the more I dread the consequences of\r\nthe non-adoption of the Constitution by any of the other States--the\r\nmore I fear an eventual disunion, and civil war. God grant that\r\nVirginia may accede. The example will have a vast influence on our\r\npolitics. New Hampshire, all accounts give us to expect, will be an\r\nassenting State.\r\n\r\nThe number of the volumes of the Federalist which you desired, have\r\nbeen forwarded, as well the second as the first, to the care of\r\nGovernor Randolph. It was impossible to correct a certain error.\r\n\r\nIn a former letter, I requested you to communicate to me, by express,\r\nthe event of any decisive question in favor of the Constitution,\r\nauthorizing changes of horses, &c., with an assurance to the person\r\nthat he will be liberally paid for his diligence.\r\n\r\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Madison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMADISON TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        Richmond, June 9, 1788.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nThe heat of the weather, &c., has laid me up with a bilious attack: I\r\nam not able, therefore, to say more than a few words.\r\n\r\nNo material indications have taken place since my last. The chance at\r\npresent seems to be in our favor. But it is possible things may take\r\nanother turn. Oswald of Philadelphia came here on Saturday; and has\r\ncloset interviews with the leaders of the opposition.\r\n\r\n                                                  Yours, affectionately,\r\n                                                  J. Madison.\r\n\r\nAlex. Hamilton, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRUFUS KING TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                         Boston, June 12, 1788.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nI have made an arrangement to forward by express the result of the\r\nConvention of New Hampshire to Springfield, in this State, from which\r\nplace Gen. Knox has engaged a conveyance to you at Poughkeepsie.\r\nThose who are best informed of the situation of the question, in New\r\nHampshire, are positive that the decision will be such as we wish, and\r\nfrom the particular parts which I have heard, I can entertain no fear\r\nof a disappointment from that quarter. The accession of New Hampshire\r\nwill present the subject to your Convention in a new, and indeed, an\r\nextraordinary light. I think your opponents, powerful as they may be,\r\nwill be greatly perplexed, although they may outnumber you, and a small\r\nmajority of the people of the State may be on their side, yet I cannot\r\nthink they will have the hardiness to negative the question.\r\n\r\nYou may pronounce, with the utmost confidence, that the decision of\r\nour Convention has proved entirely satisfactory to our people. I have\r\nmade a business of conversing with men from all parts of the State,\r\nand am completely satisfied that the Constitution is highly popular;\r\nthat its opponents are now very few, and those few hourly diminishing.\r\nBe assured that the organization of the Government (by _nine States_,\r\nis considered as certain), although a subject of delicacy, is most\r\nearnestly desired, and from the conversation of both yeoman and\r\npolitician, I am persuaded, that the people of Massachusetts are\r\nsufficiently mature and firm, to execute, so far as depends on them,\r\nwhat shall be proper as good subjects of the new Government.\r\n\r\n                                                    Farewell.\r\n                                                    Yours, &c.,\r\n                                                    Rufus King.\r\n\r\nCol. A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nPray mention to Knox that I should have written to him had I not\r\nsupposed him on his way here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMADISON TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       Richmond, June 16, 1788.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nYours of the 8th has just come to hand. I mentioned in my last that\r\nOswald had been here in consultation with the Anti-federal leaders.\r\nThe contents of your letter confirm the idea that a requisition for\r\ndelay is on foot between the opposition here and with you. We have\r\nconjectured for some days, that the policy is to spin out the session,\r\nin order to receive overtures from your Convention; or, if that cannot\r\nbe, to weary the members into an adjournment, without taking any\r\ndecision. It is presumed, at the same time, that they do not despair of\r\ncarrying the point of previous amendments, which is preferable game.\r\nThe parties continue to be nearly balanced. If we have a majority at\r\nall, it does not exceed three or four. If we lose it, Kentucke will be\r\nthe cause; they are generally, if not unanimously against us.\r\n\r\nI have been partially recovered since my last, but to-day have a sort\r\nof relapse. My health is not good, and the business is wearisome beyond\r\nexpression. I wish you every happiness, and\r\n\r\n                                                Am yours,\r\n                                                J. Madison, Jr.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nH. LEE TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                   1788.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir:\r\n\r\nGod bless you and your efforts to save me from the manifold ----\r\nmisfortunes which have and continue to oppress me, whenever I attempt\r\nto aid human nature. You will do what you think best, and whatever you\r\ndo I will confirm. * * * * has acted the part of a decided rascal, and\r\nif I fail in my right, I may not in personal revenge.\r\n\r\nOur Convention is in full debate on the great business of the Federal\r\nConstitution. We possess, as yet, in defiance of great overtures, a\r\nmajority, but very small indeed.\r\n\r\nA correspondence has certainly been opened through a Mr. O. of\r\nPhiladelphia, from the malcontents of P. and N. Y. to us. It has its\r\noperation, but I believe we are still safe, unless the question of\r\nadjournment be introduced, and love of home may induce some of our\r\nfriends to abandon their principles.\r\n\r\n                                                        Adieu,\r\n                                                        H. Lee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMADISON TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       Richmond, June 20, 1788.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nOur debates have advanced as far as the judiciary department, against\r\nwhich a great effort is making. The appellate cognizance of fact,\r\nand an extension of the power to causes between citizens of different\r\nStates, with some lesser objections, are the topics chiefly dwelt on.\r\nThe retrospection to cases antecedent to the Constitution, such as\r\nBritish debts, and an apprehended revival of the Fairfax, Indiana,\r\nVandalia, &c., claims, are also brought into view in all the terrific\r\ncolors which imagination can give them. A few days more will probably\r\nproduce a decision, though it is surmised, that something is expected\r\nfrom your Convention in consequence of the mission formerly suggested\r\nto you. Delay and an adjournment will be tried, if the adverse party\r\nfind their numbers inferior, and can prevail on themselves to remain\r\nhere till the other side can be wearied into that mode of relieving\r\nthemselves. At present, it is calculated, that we still retain a\r\nmajority of three or four; and if we can weather the storm against\r\nthe part under consideration, I shall hold the danger to be pretty\r\nwell over. There is nevertheless a very disagreeable uncertainty in\r\nthe case; and the more so, as there is a possibility that our present\r\nstrength may be miscalculated.\r\n\r\n                                                Yours, affectionately,\r\n                                                J. Madison, Jr.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      Poughkeepsie, June, 1788.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 20th came to hand two days since. I regret that your\r\nprospects are not yet reduced to greater certainty. There is more and\r\nmore reason to believe that our conduct will be influenced by yours.\r\n\r\nOur discussions have not yet travelled beyond the power of taxation.\r\nTo-day we shall probably quit this ground to pass to another. Our\r\narguments confound, but do not convince. Some of the leaders, however,\r\nappear to be convinced by _circumstances_, and to be desirous of a\r\nretreat. This does not apply to the chief, who wishes to establish\r\nClintonism on the basis of Anti-federalism.\r\n\r\n                                          I remain affectionately yours,\r\n                                          A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   Poughkeepsie, June 21, 1788.\r\n\r\nYesterday, my dear sir, the Convention made a House. That day and\r\nthis have been spent in preliminary arrangements. To-morrow, we go\r\ninto a committee of the whole on the Constitution. There is every\r\nappearance that a full discussion will take place, which will keep us\r\ntogether at least a fortnight. It is not easy to conjecture what will\r\nbe the result. Our adversaries greatly outnumber us. The leaders gave\r\nindications of a pretty desperate disposition in private conversations\r\nprevious to the meeting; but I imagine the minor partisans have their\r\nscruples, and an air of moderation is now assumed. So far the thing\r\nis not despaired of. A happy issue with you must have considerable\r\ninfluence upon us. I have time to add nothing more than the assurances\r\nof my sincere attachment.\r\n\r\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   Poughkeepsie, June 21, 1788.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir:\r\n\r\nI thank you for your letter of the 9th instant, and am glad to learn\r\nthat you think the chance is in your favor. I hope no disagreeable\r\nchange may appear. Yet, I own I fear something from your indisposition.\r\n\r\nOur debate here began on the clause respecting the proportion of\r\nrepresentation, &c., which has taken up two days. To-morrow, I imagine,\r\nwe shall talk about the power over elections. The only good information\r\nI can give you is, that we shall be some time together, and take the\r\nchance of events.\r\n\r\nThe object of the party at present is undoubtedly conditional\r\namendments. What effect events may have cannot precisely be foreseen. I\r\nbelieve the adoption by New Hampshire is certain.\r\n\r\n                                                  Yours, affectionately,\r\n                                                  A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMADISON TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       Richmond, June 22, 1788.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nThe Judiciary Department has been on the anvil for several days,\r\nand I presume will still be a further subject of disquisition. The\r\nattacks on it have apparently made less impression than was feared.\r\nBut they may be secretly felt by particular interests that could\r\nnot make the acknowledgment, and we choose to ground their vote\r\nagainst the Constitution in other motives. In the course of this\r\nweek we hope for a close of the business in some form or other. The\r\nopponents will probably bring forward a bill of rights, with sundry\r\nother amendments, as conditions of ratification. Should these fail,\r\nor be despaired of, an adjournment will, I think, be attempted. And\r\nin case of disappointment here also, some predict a secession. I do\r\nnot myself concur in the last apprehension, though I have thought\r\nit prudent to withhold, by a studied fairness in every step on the\r\nside of the Constitution, every pretext for rash experiments. The\r\nplan meditated by the friends of the Constitution is to preface the\r\nratification with some plain and general truths that cannot affect\r\nthe validity of the act, and to subjoin a recommendation, which may\r\nhold up amendments as objects to be pursued in the constitutional\r\nmode. These expedients are rendered prudent by the nice balance of\r\nnumbers, and the scruples entertained by some who are in general well\r\naffected. Whether they will secure us a majority, I dare not positively\r\nto declare. Our calculations promise us success by three or four, or\r\npossibly five or six votes. But were there no possibility of mistaking\r\nthe opinions of some, in reviewing those of so many, the smallness\r\nof the majority suggests the danger from ordinary casualties, which\r\nmay vary the result. It unluckily happens that our legislature, which\r\nmeets at this place to-morrow, consists of a considerable majority of\r\nAnti-federal members. This is another circumstance that ought to check\r\nour confidence. As individuals they may have some influence; and, as\r\ncoming immediately from the people at large, they can give any color\r\nthey please to the popular sentiments at this moment, and may in that\r\nmode throw a bias on the representatives of the people in Convention.\r\n\r\n                                                Yours, affectionately,\r\n                                                J. Madison, Jr.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Poughkeepsie, Friday morning, June 27, 1788.\r\n\r\nA day or two ago, General Schuyler, at my request, sent forward to you\r\nan express with an account of the adoption of the Constitution by New\r\nHampshire. We eagerly wait for further intelligence from you, as our\r\nchance of success depends upon you. There are some slight symptoms of\r\nrelaxation in some of the leaders, which authorizes a gleam of hope, if\r\nyou do well, but certainly I think not otherwise.\r\n\r\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nTo Hon. James Madison, Jr.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMADISON TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       Richmond, June 27, 1788.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir:\r\n\r\nThis day put an end to the existence of our Convention. The inclosed\r\nis a copy of the Act of Ratification. It has been followed by a number\r\nof recommendatory alterations, many of them highly objectionable. One\r\nof the most so is an article prohibiting direct taxes where effectual\r\nlaws shall be passed by the States for the purpose. It was impossible\r\nto prevent this error. The minority will sign an address to the people.\r\nThe genius of it is unknown to me. It is announced as an exhortation\r\nto acquiesce in the result of the Convention. Notwithstanding the\r\nfair propositions made by some, I am so uncharitable as to suspect,\r\nthat the ill-will to the Constitution will produce every peaceable\r\neffort to disgrace and destroy it. Mr. Henry declared, previous to the\r\nfinal question, that although he should submit as a quiet citizen, he\r\nshould wait with impatience for the favorable moment of regaining,\r\nin a _constitutional way_, the lost liberties of his country. My\r\nconjecture is, that exertions will be made to engage two-thirds of the\r\nlegislatures in the task of regularly undermining the Government. This\r\nhint may not be unworthy of your attention.\r\n\r\n                                                Yours, affectionately,\r\n                                                J. Madison, Jr.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMADISON TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                        June 31, 1788.\r\n\r\nInclosed is the final result of our conventional deliberations. The\r\nintended address of the minority proved to be of a nature apprehended\r\nby me. It was rejected by the party themselves, when proposed to them,\r\nand produced an auspicious conclusion to the business. As I shall set\r\nout in a few days for New-York, I postpone further explanations. I have\r\nthis instant the communications from New Hampshire via Poughkeepsie;\r\nalso, your two favors of the 19th and 20th.\r\n\r\n                                                Yours, affectionately,\r\n                                                J. Madison, Jr.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           July 8, 1788.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir:\r\n\r\nI felicitate you sincerely on the event in Virginia, but my\r\nsatisfaction will be allayed if I discover too much facility in the\r\nbusiness of amendment-making. I fear the system will be wounded in\r\nsome of its vital parts by too general a concurrence in some very\r\ninjudicious recommendations. I allude more particularly to the power of\r\ntaxation. The more I consider _requisition_ in any shape, the more I\r\nam out of humor with it. We yesterday passed through the Constitution.\r\nTo-day some definitive proposition is to be brought forward, but\r\nwhat we are at a loss to judge. We have good reason to believe that\r\nour opponents are not agreed, and this affords some ground of hope.\r\nDifferent things are thought of--_conditions precedent_, or previous\r\namendments; _conditions subsequent_, or the proposition of amendments,\r\nupon condition that if they are not adopted within a limited time,\r\nthe State shall be at liberty to _withdraw_ from the Union; and\r\nlastly, _recommendatory amendments_. In either case, _constructive\r\ndeclarations_ will be carried as far as possible. We will go as\r\nfar as we can in the latter without invalidating the act, and will\r\nconcur in rational recommendations. The rest for our opponents. We\r\nare informed there has been a disturbance in the city of Albany, on\r\nthe 4th of July, which has occasioned bloodshed. The Anti-federalists\r\nwere the aggressors, and the Federalists the victors. Thus stand our\r\naccounts at present. We trust, however, the matter has passed over, and\r\ntranquillity been restored.\r\n\r\n                                                  Yours, affectionately,\r\n                                                  A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Poughkeepsie, Saturday, July, 1788.\r\n\r\nI thank you, my dear sir, for yours by the post. Yesterday, I\r\ncommunicated to Duer our situation, which I presume he will have\r\ncommunicated to you. It remains exactly the same. No further question\r\nhaving been taken, I fear the footing I mentioned to Duer is the\r\nbest upon which it can be placed; but every thing possible will yet\r\nbe attempted to bring the party from that stand to an unqualified\r\nratification. Let me know your idea upon the possibility of our being\r\nreceived on that plan. You will understand that the only qualification\r\nwill be the _reservation_ of a right to recede, in case our amendments\r\nhave not been decided upon in one of the modes pointed out by the\r\nConstitution within a certain number of years, perhaps five or seven.\r\nIf this can in the first instance be admitted as a ratification, I do\r\nnot fear any further consequences. Congress will, I presume, recommend\r\ncertain amendments to render the _structure_ of the Government more\r\nsecure. This will satisfy the more considerate and honest opposers of\r\nthe Constitution, and with the aid of them will break up the party.\r\n\r\n                                                  Yours, affectionately,\r\n                                                  A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMADISON TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      New-York, Sunday evening.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir:\r\n\r\nYours, of yesterday, is this instant come to hand, and I have but a\r\nfew minutes to answer it. I am sorry that your situation obliges you\r\nto listen to propositions of the nature you describe. My opinion is,\r\nthat a reservation of a right to withdraw, if amendments be not decided\r\non under the form of the Constitution within a certain time, is a\r\n_conditional_ ratification; that it does not make New-York a member of\r\nthe new Union, and consequently that she could not be received on that\r\nplan. Compacts must be reciprocal--this principle would not in such a\r\ncase be preserved. The Constitution requires an adoption _in toto_ and\r\n_for ever_. It has been so adopted by the other States. An adoption\r\nfor a limited time would be as defective as an adoption of some of the\r\narticles only. In short, any _condition_ whatever must vitiate the\r\nratification. What the new Congress, by virtue of the power to admit\r\nnew States, may be _able_ and disposed to do in such case, I do not\r\ninquire, as I suppose that is not the material point at present. I\r\nhave not a moment to add more than my fervent wishes for your success\r\nand happiness. The idea of reserving a right to withdraw was started\r\nat Richmond, and considered as a conditional ratification, which was\r\nitself abandoned as worse than a rejection.\r\n\r\n                                             Yours,\r\n                                             James Madison, Jr.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIPMAN TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       Tinmouth, July 14, 1788.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nYour character as a federalist has induced me, although, personally\r\nunknown to you, to address you on a subject of very great importance\r\nto the State of Vermont, of which I am a citizen, and from which I\r\nthink may be derived a considerable advantage to the federal cause. Ten\r\nStates have now adopted the new federal plan of government. That it\r\nwill now succeed is beyond a doubt; what disputes the other States may\r\noccasion I know not. The people of this State, could certain obstacles\r\nbe removed, I believe, might be induced almost unanimously to throw\r\nthemselves into the federal scale. You are not unacquainted with the\r\nsituation of a considerable part of our landed property. Many grants\r\nwere formerly made by the government of New-York, of lands within\r\nthis territory while under that jurisdiction. On the assumption of\r\ngovernment by the people of this State, the same lands, partly, it is\r\nsaid, for want of information respecting the true situation of these\r\ngrants, and partly from the opinion prevailing with our then leaders,\r\nthat the New-York grants within this territory were of no validity,\r\nhave been granted to others under the authority of this State.\r\n\r\nIt is now generally believed that, should we be received into the\r\nUnion, the New-York grants would, in the federal courts, be preferred\r\nto those of Vermont. The Legislature of this State have in some\r\ninstances made a compensation to the grantees under New-York, and I\r\nam persuaded, were it in their power, would gladly do the same for\r\nothers, but they are possessed of no more land for that purpose.\r\nFor these reasons, I presume no others, the Governor and some few\r\ngentlemen deeply interested in those lands under Vermont, have\r\nexpressed themselves somewhat bitterly against the new federal plan of\r\ngovernment. Indeed, were we to be admitted unconditionally it would\r\nintroduce much confusion. Now, sir, permit me to ask whether you do not\r\nthink it probable that the federal legislature, when formed, might, on\r\nour accession, be induced on some terms to make a compensation to the\r\nNew-York grantees out of their western land? And whether those grantees\r\nmight not be induced to accept of such compensation? Let me further\r\nsuggest whether it might be favorable for Vermont to make some of those\r\namendments, which have been proposed by several States, and which, I\r\nthink, are generally within the power of the federal legislature, the\r\nbasis of her admission. Could the difficulties I have mentioned be\r\nremoved, all interest in opposition could here be reconciled. The idea\r\nof procuring justice to be done those whom we had perhaps injured by\r\nour too precipitate measures, and of being connected with a Government\r\nwhich promises to be efficient, permanent, and honorable, would, I am\r\npersuaded, produce the greatest unanimity on the subject. If you think\r\nthese matters worthy the attention of the friends of the Confederacy,\r\nbe good enough to write me by my brother, who will be the bearer of\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nOur Legislature will meet in October, when these matters will be taken\r\nup seriously. Several gentlemen of my acquaintance, who are men of\r\ninfluence, and will be members of the Legislature, have requested me to\r\nprocure all the information in my power on this subject. Any thing you\r\nmay communicate to me in confidence will be sacredly attended to, of\r\nwhich Mr. Kelly, who writes by the same opportunity, will give you the\r\nfullest assurance.\r\n\r\n                                   I am, Sir, with sentiments of esteem,\r\n                                   Your most obedient servant,\r\n                                   Nathaniel Chipman.\r\n\r\nAlex. Hamilton, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO CHIPMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   Poughkeepsie, July 22, 1788.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nYour brother delivered me your favor, which I received with pleasure,\r\nas the basis of a correspondence that may be productive of public\r\ngood. The accession of Vermont to the Confederacy is, doubtless, an\r\nobject of great importance to the whole; and it appears to me that this\r\nis the favorable moment for effecting it upon the best terms for all\r\nconcerned. Besides more general reasons, there are circumstances of\r\nthe moment which will forward a proper arrangement. One of the first\r\nsubjects of deliberation with the new Congress will be the independence\r\nof Kentucky, for which the Southern States will be anxious. The\r\nNorthern will be glad to send a counterpoise in Vermont. These mutual\r\ninterests and inclinations will facilitate a proper result.\r\n\r\nI see nothing that can stand in your way but the interfering claims\r\nunder the grants of New-York. As to taxation, the natural operation of\r\nthe new system will place you exactly where you might wish to be. The\r\npublic debt, as far as it can prudently be provided for, will be by the\r\nWestern lands and the appropriation of some general fund. _There will\r\nbe no distribution of it to particular parts of the community._ The\r\nfund will be sought for in indirect taxation; as for a number of years,\r\nand except in time of war, direct taxes would be an impolitic measure.\r\nHence, as you can have no objection to your proportion of contribution\r\nas consumers, you can fear nothing from the article of taxation.\r\n\r\nI readily conceive that it will hardly be practicable to you to come\r\ninto the Union unless you are secured from claims under New-York\r\ngrants. Upon the whole, therefore, I think it will be expedient for\r\nyou, as early as possible, to ratify the Constitution, “upon condition\r\nthat Congress shall provide for the extinguishment of all existing\r\nclaims to land under grants of the State of New-York, which may\r\ninterfere with claims under the grants of the State of Vermont.” You\r\nwill do well to conform your boundary to that heretofore marked out by\r\nCongress, otherwise insuperable difficulties would be likely to arise\r\nwith this State.\r\n\r\nI should think it altogether unadvisable to annex any other conditions\r\nto your ratification; for there is scarcely any of the amendments\r\nproposed that will not have a party opposed to it, and there are\r\nseveral that will meet with a very strong opposition; and it would,\r\ntherefore, be highly inexpedient for you to embarrass your main object\r\nby any collateral difficulties.\r\n\r\nAs I write in Convention, I have it not in my power to enlarge. You\r\nwill perceive my general ideas on the subject. I will only add, that it\r\nwill be wise to lay as little impediment as possible in the way of your\r\nreception into the Union.\r\n\r\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   Poughkeepsie, July 22, 1788.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir:\r\n\r\nI wrote to you by the last post, since which nothing material has\r\nturned up here. We are debating on amendments without having decided\r\nwhat is to be done with them. There is so great a diversity in the\r\nviews of our opponents that it is impossible to predict any thing. Upon\r\nthe whole, however, our fears diminish.\r\n\r\n                                                   Yours affectionately,\r\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nJames Madison, jr., New-York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO SAMUEL BROOME.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        New-York, Aug. 6, 1788.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir:\r\n\r\nI have this moment received your letter of the thirteenth ultimo, and\r\nam sorry that the rules of propriety in respect to my situation, as a\r\nmember of Congress, will not permit my acting in the capacity you wish.\r\n\r\nMy situation for some time past has prevented my acknowledging one or\r\ntwo of your favors, which have been duly handed to me. I recollect\r\nthat one of them contains an inquiry concerning your son, to which you\r\nwill naturally desire an answer. My public avocations, for some time\r\npast, have put it out of my power to ascertain the progress he has\r\nmade; though I expect, when I shall be enough disengaged to examine, to\r\nfind it a good one. It cannot fail to be so, if his diligence has been\r\nequal to his capacity. I shall shortly write you further on the subject.\r\n\r\n                                                  With great esteem,\r\n                                                  I remain, Sir,\r\n                                                  Your obedient servant,\r\n                                                  A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nMr. Samuel Broome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     New-York, August 18, 1788.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nCaptain Cochran of the British navy has requested my aid in recovering\r\na family watch in the possession of ----. In compliance with his\r\nrequest, I have written the letter herewith (to ---- ----), which\r\nI take the liberty to convey through you, in hope that if you see\r\nno impropriety in it, you would add your influence to the endeavor\r\nto gratify Captain Cochran. It is one of those things in which the\r\naffections are apt to be interested beyond the value of the object, and\r\nin which one naturally feels an inclination to oblige.\r\n\r\nI have delivered to Mr. Madison, to be forwarded to you, a set of\r\nthe papers under the signature of Publius, neatly enough bound to be\r\nhonored with a place in your library. I presume you have understood\r\nthat the writers of these papers are chiefly Mr. Madison and myself,\r\nwith some aid from Mr. Jay.\r\n\r\nI take it for granted, sir, you have concluded to comply with what will\r\nno doubt be the general call of your country in relation to the new\r\nGovernment. You will permit me to say that it is indispensable you\r\nshould lend yourself to its first operations. It is of little purpose\r\nto have _introduced_ a system, if the weightiest influence is not given\r\nto its firm _establishment_ in the outset.\r\n\r\n                                      I remain with the greatest esteem,\r\n                                      Your obedient and humble servant,\r\n                                      A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nGeneral Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO GOVERNOR LIVINGSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     New-York, August 29, 1788.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nWe are informed here, that there is some probability that your\r\nLegislature will instruct your delegates to vote for Philadelphia\r\nas the place of the meeting of the first Congress under the new\r\nGovernment. I presume this information can hardly be well founded,\r\nas upon my calculations, there is not a State in the Union so much\r\ninterested in having the temporary residence at New-York, as New Jersey.\r\n\r\nAs between Philadelphia and New-York, I am mistaken if a greater\r\nproportion of your State will not be benefited by having the seat of\r\ngovernment at the latter than the former place.\r\n\r\nIf at the latter, too, its exposed and eccentric position will\r\nnecessitate the early establishment of a permanent seat, and in passing\r\nsouth, it is highly probable the Government would light upon the\r\nDelaware in New Jersey. The Northern States do not wish to increase\r\nPennsylvania, by an accession of all the wealth and population of the\r\nFederal City. Pennsylvania, herself, when not seduced by _immediate\r\npossession_, will be glad to concur in a situation on the Jersey side\r\nof the Delaware. Here are at once a majority of the States; but place\r\nthe Government once down in Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania will, of course,\r\nhold fast; the State of Delaware will do the same.\r\n\r\nAll the States south, looking forward to the time, when the balance\r\nof population will enable them to carry the Government further south\r\n(say to the Potomac), and being accommodated in the mean time as well\r\nas they wish, will concur in no change. The Government, from the delay,\r\nwill take root in Philadelphia, and Jersey will lose all prospect of\r\nthe Federal City within her limits.\r\n\r\nThese appear to me calculations so obvious, that I cannot persuade\r\nmyself New Jersey will so much _oversee_ her interest as to fall, in\r\nthe present instance, into the snares of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n                                  With the sincerest respect and regard,\r\n                                  I remain, dear Sir,\r\n                                  Your obedient servant,\r\n                                  A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIPMAN TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        Newfane, Sept. 6, 1788.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nI have received by Capt. Ville, your favor of the 22d of July. Since I\r\nwrote you, I have had an opportunity of conversing with his Excellency,\r\nthe Governor, and most of the council, on the subject of Vermont’s\r\naccession to the Confederacy. They generally agree, that the terms\r\nsuggested are good; that it will be highly the interest of Vermont to\r\naccede; and that the present is likely to be a favorable crisis. But it\r\nis a question whether we ought to make any propositions to the present\r\nCongress, or prepare matters, and wait the new arrangement. Vermont\r\nwill not make a point of introducing any amendments. We shall not be\r\nthe first to feel the inconveniences, if any should arise, from the\r\nexercise of the new federal powers. For myself, I readily conceive,\r\nthat direct taxation, under the new system, will be very inconsiderable\r\nduring the continuance of peace; yet I find an exemption from the\r\nexpenses of the late war will have with the citizens of this State a\r\nvery powerful effect in producing unanimity on the subject of a Union.\r\n\r\nBut I hope this matter will in some way be compromised. If, sir, you\r\nhave any thing to suggest on this subject, that may promote the public\r\ngood, I should be very happy in the communication, previous to the\r\nsession of Assembly in October next. The choice of representatives,\r\nwhich was on Tuesday last, has, as far as I have heard, succeeded\r\nfavorably. Mr. Kelly, who is so obliging as to take charge of this\r\nletter, will be able to give you a more particular account than can\r\nbe done in this way, as he has conversed largely with the Governor,\r\nCouncil, and other persons of influence, with whom he has great weight.\r\n\r\n                                           I am, Sir,\r\n                                           With much esteem and respect,\r\n                                           Your most obedient servant,\r\n                                           Nathl. Chipman.\r\n\r\nA. Hamilton, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     New-York, September, 1788.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nYour Excellency’s friendly and obliging letter of the 28th ultimo,\r\ncame safely to hand. I thank you for your assurance of seconding my\r\napplication to General ----. The truth of that affair is, that he\r\npurchased the watch for a trifle of a British soldier, who plundered\r\nMajor Cochran, at the moment of his fall, at Yorktown.\r\n\r\nI should be deeply pained, my dear sir, if your scruples in regard to\r\na certain station, should be matured into a resolution to decline it;\r\nthough I am neither surprised at their existence, nor can I but agree\r\nin opinion, that the caution you observe, in deferring an ultimate\r\ndetermination, is prudent. I have, however, reflected maturely on the\r\nsubject, and have come to a conclusion (in which I feel no hesitation),\r\nthat every public and personal consideration will demand from you an\r\nacquiescence in what will _certainly_ be the unanimous wish of your\r\ncountry. The absolute retreat which you meditated at the close of\r\nthe late war was natural, and proper. Had the Government produced by\r\nthe revolution, gone on in a _tolerable_ train, it would have been\r\nmost advisable to have persisted in that retreat. But I am clearly of\r\nopinion, that the crisis which brought you again into public view,\r\nleft you no alternative but to comply; and I am equally clear in\r\nthe opinion, that you are by that act _pledged_ to take a part in\r\nthe execution of the Government. I am not less convinced, that the\r\nimpression of this necessity of your filling the station in question,\r\nis so universal, that you run no risk of any uncandid imputation by\r\nsubmitting to it. But even if this were not the case, a regard to your\r\nown reputation, as well as to the public good, calls upon you in the\r\nstrongest manner, to run that risk.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be considered as a compliment to say, that on your acceptance\r\nof the office of President, the success of the new Government, in its\r\ncommencement, may materially depend. Your agency and influence will\r\nbe not less important in preserving it from the future attacks of its\r\nenemies, than they have been in recommending it in the first instance,\r\nto the adoption of the people. Independent of all considerations drawn\r\nfrom this source, the point of light in which you stand at home and\r\nabroad, will make an infinite difference in the respectability with\r\nwhich the Government will begin its operations, in the alternative\r\nof your being or not being at the head of it. I forbear to urge\r\nconsiderations which might have a more personal application. What I\r\nhave said will suffice for the inferences I mean to draw.\r\n\r\nFirst. In a matter so essential to the well-being of society, as the\r\nprosperity of a newly instituted government, a citizen of so much\r\nconsequence as yourself to its success, has no option but to lend his\r\nservices if called for. Permit me to say, it would be inglorious, in\r\nsuch a situation, not to hazard the glory, however great, which he\r\nmight have previously acquired.\r\n\r\nSecondly. Your signature to the proposed system, pledges your judgment\r\nfor its being such an one as, upon the whole, was worthy of the public\r\napprobation. If it should miscarry (as men commonly decide from\r\nsuccess, or the want of it), the blame will, in all probability, be\r\nlaid on the system itself; and the framers of it will have to encounter\r\nthe disrepute of having brought about a revolution in government,\r\nwithout substituting any thing that was worthy of the effort. They\r\npulled down one Utopia, it will be said, to build up another. This view\r\nof the subject, if I mistake not, my dear sir, will suggest to your\r\nmind greater hazard to that fame, which must be and ought to be dear\r\nto you, in refusing your future aid to the system, than in affording\r\nit. I will only add, that in my estimate of the matter, that aid is\r\nindispensable.\r\n\r\nI have taken the liberty to express these sentiments, and to lay before\r\nyou my view of the subject. I doubt not the considerations mentioned,\r\nhave fully occurred to you, and I trust they will finally produce in\r\nyour mind the same result which exists in mine. I flatter myself, the\r\nfrankness with which I have delivered myself will not be displeasing to\r\nyou. It has been prompted by motives which you would not disapprove.\r\n\r\n                                  I remain, my dear Sir,\r\n                                  With the sincerest respect and regard,\r\n                                  Your obedient and humble servant,\r\n                                  A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEUBEN TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     Le 5 de Sept. 1788.\r\n\r\nMonsieur,\r\n\r\nLa lettre c’y joint de Mr. R. Peters, contienne une preuve, non\r\néquivoque, que dans mes premières applications et immédiatement après\r\nla paix, j’ai appuyé mes prétentions aux E. U. sur une stipulation ou\r\ncontract fait en entrant dans leur service.\r\n\r\nComme vous étiez de cette même committée à Philadelphie, je m’en\r\nrapporte à votre mémoire. Dans tous les committées subséquentes j’ai\r\ntoujours appuyé sur ce même contract, et je me rapporte à tous les\r\nMessieurs qui successivement furent des committées sur ce sujet. Comme\r\nvous étes de la presente Congrès, je vous prie de communiquer la\r\nreporte de Mr. Peters à cette committée.\r\n\r\n                                   J’ai l’honneur d’ètre avec affection,\r\n                                   Monsieur,\r\n                                   Votre très humble,\r\n                                   Steuben.\r\n\r\nAlexander Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO THEODORE SEDGEWICK.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        New-York, Oct. 9, 1788.\r\n\r\nYour last letter but one met me at Albany attending court, whence I\r\nam just returned. I am sorry for the schism you hint at among the\r\nFederalists, but I have so much confidence in the good management of\r\nthe fast friends of the Constitution, that I hope no ill consequences\r\nwill ensue from that disagreement. It will, however, be worthy of great\r\ncare to avoid suffering a difference of opinion on collateral points,\r\nto produce any serious division between those who have hitherto drawn\r\ntogether on the great national question. Permit me to add, that I do\r\nnot think you should allow any line to be run between those who wish\r\nto trust alterations to future experience, and those who are desirous\r\nof them at the present juncture. The rage for amendments is, in my\r\nopinion, rather to be parried by address than encountered with open\r\nforce; and I should therefore be loth to learn that your parties had\r\nbeen arrayed professedly upon the distinction I have mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe mode in which amendments may best be made, and twenty other\r\nmatters, may come as pretexts for avoiding the evil, and securing the\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n                                                   Yours,\r\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO CHIPMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                   1788.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nYour favor of the 6th of September has been duly handed to me, and I\r\nreceive great pleasure from the hopes you appear to entertain of a\r\nfavorable turn of affairs in Vermont in regard to the new Government.\r\nIt is certainly an object of mutual importance to yourselves, and to\r\nthe Union, and well deserves the best endeavors of every discerning and\r\ngood man.\r\n\r\nI observe with satisfaction your opinion that Vermont will not make\r\na point of introducing amendments. I mean as a condition of her\r\naccession. That ground would be the most hazardous which she could\r\nventure upon, as it is very probable that such amendments as might\r\nbe popular with you would be deemed inadmissible by the friends of\r\nthe system, who will doubtless be the most influential persons in the\r\nnational councils; and who would rather submit to the inconvenience\r\nof your being out of the Union, till circumstances should alter, than\r\nconsent to any thing that might impair the energy of the Government.\r\nThe article of taxation is, above all, the most delicate thing to\r\nmeddle with; for as _plenary_ power in that respect must ever be\r\nconsidered as the vital principle of government, no abridgment\r\nor constitutional suspension of that power can ever, upon mature\r\nconsideration, be countenanced by the intelligent friends of an\r\neffective National Government. You must, as I remarked in my former\r\nletter, rely upon the natural course of things, which I am satisfied\r\nwill exempt you in ordinary times from direct taxation, on account\r\nof the difficulty of exercising it in so extensive a country, so\r\npeculiarly situated, with advantage to the revenue or satisfaction to\r\nthe people. Though this difficulty will be gradually diminished from\r\nvarious causes, a considerable time must first elapse; and, in the\r\ninterim, you will have nothing to apprehend on this score.\r\n\r\nAs far as indirect taxation is concerned, it will be impossible to\r\nexempt you from sharing in the burthen, nor can it be desired by your\r\ncitizens. I repeat these ideas to impress you the more strongly with\r\nmy sense of the danger of touching this chord, and of the impolicy\r\nof perplexing the main object with any such collateral experiments,\r\nwhile I am glad to perceive that you do not think your people will be\r\ntenacious on the point.\r\n\r\nIt will be useless for you to have any view in your act to the\r\npresent Congress. They can of course do nothing in the matter. All\r\nyou will have to do, will be to pass an act of accession to the new\r\nConstitution, on the conditions upon which you mean to rely. It will\r\nthen be for the new Government, when met, to declare whether you can be\r\nreceived on your terms or not.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to find that the affair of boundary is likely to create\r\nsome embarrassment. Men’s minds, every where out of your State, are\r\nmade up upon and reconciled to that which has been delineated by\r\nCongress. Any departure from it must beget new discussions, in which\r\nall the passions will have their usual scope, and may occasion greater\r\nimpediments than the real importance of the thing would justify. If,\r\nhowever, the further claims you state cannot be gotten over with you,\r\nI would still wish to see the experiment made, though with this clog,\r\nbecause I have it very much at heart that you should become a member\r\nof the Confederacy. It is, however, not to be inferred that the same\r\ndisposition will actuate every body. In this State, the pride of\r\ncertain individuals has too long triumphed over the public interest;\r\nand in several of the Southern States a jealousy of Northern influence\r\nwill prevent any great zeal for increasing in the national councils the\r\nnumber of Northern votes.\r\n\r\nI mention these circumstances (though I dare say they will have\r\noccurred to you), to show you the necessity of moderation and caution\r\non your part, and the error of any sanguine calculation upon a\r\ndisposition to receive you at any rate. A supposition of this nature\r\nmight lead to fatal mistakes.\r\n\r\nIn the event of an extension of your boundary beyond the Congressional\r\nline, would it be impracticable for you to have commissioners appointed\r\nto adjust any differences which might arise? I presume the principal\r\nobject with you in the extension of your boundary would be to cover\r\nsome private interests. This might be matter of negotiation. There is\r\none thing which I think it proper to mention to you, about which I have\r\nsome doubt; that is, whether a legislative accession would be deemed\r\nvalid. It is the policy of the system to lay its foundations in the\r\n_immediate_ consent of the people. You will best judge how far it is\r\nsafe or practicable to have recourse to a convention. Whatever you do,\r\nno time ought to be lost. The present moment is undoubtedly critically\r\nfavorable. Let it by all means be improved. I remain, with esteem, Sir,\r\n\r\n                                       Your obedient and humble servant,\r\n                                       A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nNathaniel Chipman, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Mount Vernon, October 3, 1788.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nIn acknowledging the receipt of your candid and friendly letter of\r\n---- by the last post, little more is incumbent on me than to thank\r\nyou sincerely for the frankness with which you communicated your\r\nsentiments; and to assure you that the same manly tone of intercourse\r\nwill always be more than barely welcome. Indeed, it will be highly\r\nacceptable to me. I am particularly glad, in the present instance, you\r\nhave dealt thus freely and like a friend.\r\n\r\nAlthough I could not help observing from several publications and\r\nletters, that my name had been sometimes spoken of, and that it was\r\npossible the _contingency_ which is the subject of your letter might\r\nhappen; yet I thought it best to maintain a guarded silence and to back\r\nthe _counsel_ of my best friends (which I certainly hold in the highest\r\nestimation), rather than to hazard an imputation unfriendly to the\r\ndelicacy of my feelings. For, situated as I am, I could hardly bring\r\nthe question into the slightest discussion, or ask an opinion, even\r\nin the most confidential manner, without betraying, in my judgment,\r\nsome impropriety of conduct, or without feeling an apprehension that\r\na premature display of anxiety might be construed into a vain-glorious\r\ndesire of pushing myself into notice as a candidate. Now, if I am not\r\ngrossly deceived in myself, I should unfeignedly rejoice in case the\r\nElectors, by giving their votes in favor of some other person, would\r\nsave me from the disagreeable dilemma of being forced to accept or\r\nrefuse. If that may not be, I am in the next place earnestly desirous\r\nof searching out the truth, and of knowing whether there does not\r\nexist a probability that the Government would be just as happily and\r\neffectually carried into execution without my aid as with it. I am\r\n_truly_ solicitous to obtain all the previous information, which the\r\ncircumstances will afford, and to determine (when the determination can\r\nwith propriety be no longer postponed) according to the principles of\r\nright reason and the dictates of a clear conscience, without too great\r\na reference to the unforeseen consequences which may affect my person\r\nor reputation. Until that period, I may fairly hold myself open to\r\nconviction, though I allow your sentiments to have weight in them; and\r\nI shall not pass by your arguments without giving them as dispassionate\r\na consideration as I can possibly bestow on them.\r\n\r\nIn taking a survey of the subject in whatever point of light I have\r\nbeen able to place it, I will not suppress the acknowledgment, my dear\r\nsir, that I have always felt a kind of gloom upon my mind as often as\r\nI have been taught to expect I might, and perhaps must, ere long be\r\ncalled to make a decision. You will, I am well assured, believe the\r\nassertion (though I have little expectation it would gain credit from\r\nthose who are less acquainted with me), that if I should receive and\r\nact under the appointment, the acceptance would be attended with more\r\ndiffidence and reluctance than ever I experienced before in my life.\r\nIt would be, however, with a fixed and sole determination of lending\r\nwhatever assistance might be in my power to promote the public weal, in\r\nhopes that, at a convenient and an early period, my services might be\r\ndispensed with, and that I might be permitted once more to retire, to\r\npass an unclouded evening after the stormy day of life, in the bosom\r\nof domestic tranquillity. But why these anticipations? If the friends\r\nof the Constitution conceive that my administering the Government will\r\nbe the means of its acceleration and strength, is it not probable\r\nthat the adversaries thereof may entertain the same ideas, and of\r\ncourse make it an object of opposition? That many of this description\r\nwill be amongst the Electors, I have no more doubt than I have of\r\nthe part they will act at the election, which will be adverse to the\r\nchoice of any character who, from whatever cause, would be likely to\r\nthwart their views. It might be impolitic perhaps in them to make\r\nthis declaration _previous_ to the election, but I shall be out in my\r\nconjectures if they do not act conformably thereto at it, and prove\r\nthat all the _seeming_ moderation by which their present conduct is\r\nmarked, is calculated to lull and deceive. Their plan of opposition is\r\nsystematized, and a regular intercourse between the leaders of it in\r\nthe several States (I have much reason to believe) is formed to render\r\nit more effectual.\r\n\r\n                           With sentiments of sincere regard and esteem,\r\n                           I am, dear Sir,\r\n                           Your most obedient humble servant,\r\n                           George Washington.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Alexander Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO THEODORE SEDGEWICK.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     New-York, October 9, 1788.\r\n\r\nI thank you, my dear sir, for your obliging congratulations on the\r\nevent towards effecting which your aid as a joint laborer was so\r\nessential. I hope experience may show that, while it promotes the\r\ninterest of this place, it will not be incompatible with public good.\r\nWe are making efforts to prepare handsome accommodations for the\r\nsession of the new Congress.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of Vice-President, my ideas have concurred with\r\nyours, and I believe Mr. Adams will have the votes of this State.\r\nHe will certainly, I think, be preferred to the other gentleman.\r\nYet _certainly_ is perhaps too strong a word. I can conceive that\r\nthe other, who is supposed to be a more pliable man, may command\r\nanti-federal influence.\r\n\r\nThe only hesitation in my mind with regard to Mr. Adams has arisen\r\nwithin a day or two, from a suggestion by a particular gentleman that\r\nhe is unfriendly in his sentiments to General Washington. Richard H.\r\nLee, who will probably, as rumor now runs, come from Virginia, is also\r\nin this style. The Lees and Adams’s have been in the habit of uniting,\r\nand hence may spring up a cabal very embarrassing to the Executive,\r\nand of course to the administration of the government. Consider\r\nthis,--sound the reality of it, and let me hear from you.\r\n\r\nWhat think you of Lincoln or Knox? This is a flying thought.\r\n\r\n                                             Yours, with sincere regard,\r\n                                             A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nMr. Sedgewick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEDGEWICK TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    Stockbridge, Oct. 16, 1788.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir:\r\n\r\nYour favor of the 9th I have this moment received, and detain the post\r\na while that I may make a very few observations on a subject I conceive\r\nhighly interesting to the efficient operations of the future Government.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams was formerly infinitely more democratical than at present,\r\nand possessing that jealousy which always accompanied such a\r\ncharacter, he was averse to repose such unlimited confidence in the\r\nCommander-in-chief as then was the disposition of Congress.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams is not among the number of my particular friends, but, as a\r\nman of unconquerable intrepidity, and of incorruptible integrity, as\r\ngreatly experienced in the interests and character of this country, he\r\npossesses my highest esteem.\r\n\r\nHis writings show that he deserves the confidence of those who wish\r\nenergy in government, for although those writings are too tedious\r\nand unpleasant in perusal, yet they are evidently the result of deep\r\nreflection, and as they encounter popular prejudices are an evidence of\r\nan erect and independent spirit.\r\n\r\nLincoln and Knox I love, their characters, too, I respect, but it is\r\nnow too late to push in this State the interests of either. The minds\r\nof all men here seem to be fixed either on Adams or Hancock.\r\n\r\nOur Legislature meet on the 29th. From Boston I will early write you on\r\nthe subject, and am with sincere respect,\r\n\r\n                                            Yours, affectionately,\r\n                                            Theodore Sedgewick.\r\n\r\nHon. Mr. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEDGEWICK TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                          Boston, Nov. 2, 1788.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir:\r\n\r\nIn my last hasty letter I engaged to write to you soon after my arrival\r\nin this town. Various questions will be agitated in the Legislature\r\n(of considerable magnitude) which respect the organization of the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThere is a party of Federalists who are of opinion, that the Electors\r\nshould be chosen by the people, and the Representatives not in\r\ndistricts, but at large. These will be joined by all the antis\r\nprobably. I yet hope they will not succeed. We yesterday committed to a\r\ncommittee of both Houses the circular letter from your Convention. The\r\nevent is uncertain, but a considerable number of Federalists have been\r\nbrought over to the amendment system. The prospect is, notwithstanding,\r\nthat the real friends of the Constitution will prevail. Every thing\r\ndepends upon it, and the exertion will be proportionate to the\r\nmagnitude of the object.\r\n\r\nShould the Electors be chosen by the Legislature, Mr. Adams will\r\nprobably combine all the votes of Massachusetts. I am very certain,\r\nthat the suggestion that he is unfriendly to General Washington, is\r\nentirely unfounded. Mr. Hancock has been very explicit in patronizing\r\nthe doctrine of Amendment. The other gentleman is for postponing the\r\nconduct of that business until it shall be understood from experience.\r\n* * * *\r\n\r\n                                            I am, dear Sir,\r\n                                            Your most obedient servant,\r\n                                            Theodore Sedgewick.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Mr. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOL. OLNEY TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     Providence, 3d Nov., 1788.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nYour favor of 6th ulto., was duly received. I thought proper to\r\npostpone replying to it till after the session of the General Assembly\r\nshould be over, which terminated on Saturday night last, in order that\r\nI might have it in my power to give you, with more certainty, the\r\nproceedings of the Legislature, on the subject of the New Constitution.\r\nThe minority, both in     of the House, took unwearied pains during the\r\nsession, to procure a Convention in the legal mode pointed out for\r\nconsidering the New Constitution; but, sir, it proved, as heretofore,\r\nan unsuccessful attempt; for Mr. Hazard, who is an implacable and\r\npowerful enemy to the new system, and the leading character in all\r\nthe vile politics carrying on in this _devoted_ State, had so well\r\nprepared the majority, that when the question was put, whether this\r\nState should appoint a Convention or not, the question was lost nearly\r\nthree to one; fifteen in favor of the motion and forty-four against it.\r\nAfter which (late on Saturday night) Mr. Hazard moved that a vote be\r\npassed, for printing copies of the circular letter from the Convention\r\nof New-York, to be distributed throughout this State, and submitting\r\nto the people at large, the propriety of appointing delegates to\r\nmeet a _proposed_ Convention, for considering amendments, agreeably\r\nto the recommendations of said circular letter. The vote being put,\r\nafter much debate, it was carried in favor of the measure by three to\r\none, notwithstanding every exertion of the minority, to prevent the\r\nadoption of so novel and unprecedented a proceeding. It was urged,\r\nand with truth, that should a Convention finally meet for the purpose\r\nof amending the Constitution, that it would be composed entirely of\r\nthe adopting States; and, as such, this State could not, upon any\r\nprinciples of right, expect to be admitted to a seat in that Honorable\r\nBody, as we so obstinately (and with our eyes open) have refused,\r\nand still neglect to accede to the new system. But, sir, reason and\r\nargument will avail nothing with those wicked and designing opposers\r\nto a just and honorable Federal Government. The Assembly have made an\r\nadjournment to the last Monday in December next, in an expectation\r\nto hear the report from the respective towns. Mr. Hazard, and a Col.\r\nJohn Gardener (who is entirely under the influence of Mr. Hazard’s\r\npolitics), are ordered by the Assembly to go on from this State, and\r\ntake their seats in Congress, as soon as they can leave home; so that\r\nin a short time you will have those two antis to deal with.\r\n\r\n                                            I am, with sincere esteem,\r\n                                            Sir,\r\n                                            Your obedient humble serv’t,\r\n                                            Jeremiah Olney.\r\n\r\nCol. Alexander Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    Mount Vernon, Nov. 6, 1788.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nThe Count de Moustier affording a very favorable conveyance for Capt.\r\nCochran’s watch, I have requested the favor of him to take charge of\r\nit; and he will deliver it to you, accordingly, with Mrs. Washington’s\r\nand my best wishes for you and Mrs. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n                                  I am, dear Sir,\r\n                                  Your obedient and affectionate serv’t,\r\n                                  G. Washington.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Alexander Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO SEDGEWICK.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        New-York, Nov. 9, 1788.\r\n\r\nYour last letter but one met me at Albany, attending court, from whence\r\nI am but just returned. Yours of the 2d instant is this moment handed\r\nme.\r\n\r\nI am very sorry for the schism you hint at among the Federalists, but\r\nI have so much confidence in the good management of the fast friends\r\nof the Constitution, that I hope no ill consequences will ensue from\r\nthat disagreement. It will, however, be worthy of great care to avoid\r\nsuffering a difference of opinion on collateral points, to produce any\r\nserious division between those who have hitherto drawn together on the\r\ngreat national question.\r\n\r\nPermit me to add, that I do not think you should allow any line to be\r\nrun between those who wish to trust alterations to future experience,\r\nand those who are desirous of them at the present juncture. The rage\r\nfor amendments is, in my _opinion_, rather to be parried by address\r\nthan encountered with open force. And I shall, therefore, be loth\r\nto learn that your parties have been arranged professedly upon the\r\ndistinction I have mentioned. The _mode_ in which amendments may best\r\nbe made, and twenty other matters, may serve as pretexts for avoiding\r\nthe evil and securing the good.\r\n\r\nOn the question between Mr. H. and Mr. A., Mr. King will probably have\r\ninformed you that I have, upon the whole, concluded that the latter\r\nought to be supported. My measures will be taken accordingly. I had but\r\none scruple, but after mature consideration I have relinquished it. Mr.\r\nAdams, to a sound understanding, has always appeared to me to add an\r\nardent love for the public good; and as his further knowledge of the\r\nworld seems to have corrected those jealousies which he is represented\r\nto have been once influenced by, I trust nothing of the kind suggested\r\nin my former letter will disturb the harmony of administration. Let me\r\ncontinue to hear from you, and believe me to be, with very great esteem\r\nand regard,\r\n\r\n                                                Your friend and servant,\r\n                                                A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nT. Sedgewick, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                      November 18, 1788.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nYour last two letters have duly come to hand, and the Count de Moustier\r\nhas delivered me the watch you committed to his charge. Your obliging\r\nattention to this matter claims my particular acknowledgments. I will\r\nmake no apology for asking you to take the additional trouble of\r\nforwarding the inclosed to the General. I take the liberty of passing\r\nit through you, that you may, by perusing the contents, know the\r\nsituation of the business.\r\n\r\nThe demand of fifty guineas is to me quite unexpected. I am sorry to\r\nadd, that there is too good evidence that it cost a mere trifle to the\r\nGeneral. This, however, I mention in confidence. Nor shall I give you\r\nany further trouble on the subject. Whatever may be proper will be done.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hamilton requests her affectionate remembrances to Mrs.\r\nWashington, and joins me in the best wishes for you both.\r\n\r\n                                        I remain, dear Sir,\r\n                                        Your affectionate humble serv’t,\r\n                                        A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nP. S. Your last letter, on a certain subject, I have received. I\r\nfeel a conviction that you will finally see your acceptance to be\r\nindispensable. It is no compliment to say, that no other man can\r\nsufficiently unite the public opinion, or can give the requisite\r\nweight to the office, in the commencement of the Government. These\r\nconsiderations appear to me of themselves decisive. I am not sure that\r\nyour refusal would not throw every thing into confusion. I am sure that\r\nit would have the worst effect imaginable. Indeed, as I hinted in a\r\nformer letter, I think circumstances leave no option.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       New-York, Nov. 23, 1788.\r\n\r\nI thank you, my dear sir, for yours of the 20th. The only part of it\r\nwhich surprises me, is what you mention respecting Clinton. I cannot,\r\nhowever, believe that the plan will succeed. Nor, indeed, do I think,\r\nthat Clinton would be disposed to exchange his present appointment\r\nfor that office, or risk his popularity by holding both. At the same\r\ntime, the attempt merits attention, and ought not to be neglected as\r\nchimerical or impracticable.\r\n\r\nIn Massachusetts the Electors will, I understand, be appointed by the\r\nLegislature, and will be all Federal, and ’tis probable will be, for\r\nthe most part, in favor of Adams. It is said, the same thing will\r\nhappen in New Hampshire, and I have reason to believe, will be the\r\ncase in Connecticut. In this State it is difficult to form any certain\r\ncalculation. A large majority of the _Assembly_ was doubtless of an\r\nAnti-federal complexion, but the schism in the party which has been\r\noccasioned by the falling off of some of its leaders in the Convention,\r\nleaves me not without hope, that if matters are well managed, we may\r\nprocure a majority for some pretty equal compromise. In the Senate\r\nwe have the superiority by one. In New Jersey there seems to be no\r\nquestion, but that the complexion of the electors will be Federal;\r\nand I suppose, if thought expedient, they may be united in favor of\r\nAdams. Pennsylvania you can best judge of. From Delaware, Maryland, and\r\nSouth Carolina, I presume, we may count with tolerable assurance on\r\nFederal men; and I should imagine, if pains are taken, the danger of an\r\nAnti-federal Vice-President might itself be rendered the instrument of\r\nUnion. At any rate, their weight will not be thrown into the scale of\r\nClinton, and I do not see from what quarter numbers can be marshalled\r\nin his favor, equal to those who will advocate Adams, supposing even a\r\ndivision in the Federal votes.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, I have concluded to support Adams, though I am not\r\nwithout apprehensions on the score we have conversed about. My\r\nprincipal reasons are these: First--He is a declared partisan of\r\ndeferring to future experience the expediency of amendments in the\r\nsystem, and (although I do not altogether _adopt_ this sentiment) it\r\nis much nearer my own than certain other doctrines. Secondly--He is\r\ncertainly a character of importance in the Eastern States; if he is\r\nnot Vice-President, one of two worse things will be likely to happen.\r\nEither he must be nominated to some important office, for which he is\r\nless proper, or will become a malcontent, and give additional weight to\r\nthe opposition to the Government. As to Knox, I cannot persuade myself\r\nthat he will incline to the appointment. He must _sacrifice_ emolument\r\nby it, which must be of _necessity_ a primary object with him.\r\n\r\nIf it should be thought expedient to endeavor to unite in a particular\r\ncharacter, there is a danger of a different kind to which we must\r\nnot be inattentive--the possibility of rendering it doubtful who is\r\nappointed President. You know the Constitution has not provided the\r\nmeans of distinguishing in certain cases, and it would be disagreeable\r\neven to have a man treading close upon the heels of the person we\r\nwish as President. May not the malignity of the opposition be, in\r\nsome instances, exhibited even against him? Of all this we shall best\r\njudge, when we know who are our Electors; and we must, in our different\r\ncircles, take our measures accordingly.\r\n\r\nI could console myself for what you mention respecting yourself,\r\nfrom a desire to see you in one of the executive departments, did I\r\nnot perceive the representation will be defective in characters of a\r\ncertain description. Wilson is evidently out of the question. King\r\ntells me he does not believe he will be elected into either House. Mr.\r\nGouverneur Morris set out to-day for France, by way of Philadelphia. If\r\nyou are not in one of the branches, the Government may sincerely feel\r\nthe want of men who unite to zeal all the requisite qualifications for\r\nparrying the machinations of its enemies. Might I advise, it would be,\r\nthat you bent your course to Virginia.\r\n\r\n                                                   Affectionately yours,\r\n                                                   A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nMr. J. Madison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        Monday morning, January 4, 1789.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nI feel myself very much obliged by what you sent me yesterday.\r\nThe letter from Governor Johnston I return, much pleased to find\r\nso authentic an account of the adoption by North Carolina of the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\n                                    Yours, sincerely and affectionately,\r\n                                    G. Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON TO SEDGEWICK.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       New-York, Jan. 29, 1789.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir:\r\n\r\nI thank you for your two letters of the 4th and 7th instant, which\r\narrived here during my absence at Albany, from which place I have but\r\nrecently returned. I believe you may be perfectly tranquil on the\r\nsubject of Mr. Adams’s election. It seems to be certain that all the\r\nMiddle States will vote for him to Delaware inclusively, and probably\r\nMaryland. In the South, there are no candidates thought of but Rutledge\r\nand Clinton. The latter will have the votes of Virginia, and it is\r\n_possible_ some in South Carolina. Maryland will certainly not vote for\r\nClinton, and New-York, from our Legislature having by their contentions\r\nlet slip the day, will not vote at all. For the last circumstance, I\r\nam not sorry, as the most we could hope would be to balance accounts\r\nand do no harm. The Anti-federalists incline to an appointment\r\nnotwithstanding, but I discourage it with the Federalists. Under these\r\ncircumstances, I see not how any person can come near Mr. Adams; that\r\nis, taking it for granted that he will unite the votes in New Hampshire\r\nand Massachusetts. I expect that the Federal votes in Virginia, if any,\r\nwill be in favor of Adams.\r\n\r\nYou will probably have heard that our Legislature has passed a bill\r\nfor electing Representatives. The houses continue to disagree about\r\nSenators, and I fear a compromise will be impracticable. I do not,\r\nhowever, entirely lose hope. In this situation, you will perceive\r\nthat we have much to apprehend respecting the seat of Government.\r\nThe Pennsylvanians are endeavoring to bring their forces early in\r\nthe field. I hope our friends in the North will not be behindhand.\r\nOn many accounts, indeed, it appears to be important that there be\r\nan appearance of zeal and punctuality in coming forward to set the\r\nGovernment in motion.\r\n\r\nI shall learn with infinite pleasure that you are a Representative. As\r\nto me, this will not be the case--I believe, from my own disinclination\r\nto the thing. We shall, however, I flatter myself, have a couple of\r\nFederalists.\r\n\r\n                                I remain your affectionate and obedient,\r\n                                A. Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWADSWORTH TO HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      Hartford, February, 1789.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir:\r\n\r\nYour favor of the 25th January came in good time. Our votes were given\r\nagreeably to your wishes--Washington, 7; Adams, 5; Governor Huntington,\r\n2. By letters from Carrington, I learn that Clinton is the Anti-federal\r\nVice-president; but I think we have nothing to fear. I believe New\r\nHampshire will give Adams 4; Massachusetts, 6; Georgia, 6--as letters\r\nfrom Georgia say he will have at least so many--which, with ours,\r\nmakes 21, which is more than Clinton can get, and we may certainly\r\nreckon on three more for Adams in South Carolina, Maryland, Delaware,\r\nPennsylvania, and New Jersey. We waived an answer to your State, and to\r\nVirginia. As you did not get my letter in season to answer me on that\r\nsubject, I feared we should not do any good by an answer; and as the\r\nAnti-federalists did not move it, I thought we had best let it sleep.\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n                                            I am, dear sir,\r\n                                            Your affectionate friend,\r\n                                            Jeremiah Wadsworth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL.
