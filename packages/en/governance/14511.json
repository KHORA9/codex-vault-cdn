An \"eviction\"\r\nis to be made to-morrow on the Glenbehy[1] estate of Mr. Winn, an uncle\r\nof Lord Headley, so upon the invitation of Colonel Turner, who has come\r\nto see that all is done decently and in order, I left Ennis with him at\r\n7.40 A.M. for Limerick; the \"city of the Liberator\" for \"the city of the\r\nBroken Treaty.\" There we breakfasted at the Artillery Barracks.\r\n\r\nThe officers showed us there the new twelve-pounder gun with its\r\nelaborately scientific machinery, its Scotch sight, and its four-mile\r\nrange. I compared notes about the Trafalgar Square riots of February\r\n1886 with an Irish officer who happened to have been on the opposite\r\nside of Pall Mall from me at the moment when the mob, getting out of the\r\nhand of my socialistic friend Mr. Hyndman, and advancing towards St.\r\nJames' Street and Piccadilly was broken by a skilful and very spirited\r\ncharge of the police. He gave a most humorous account of his own\r\nsensations when he first came into contact with the multitude after\r\nemerging from St. Paul's, where, as he put it, he had left the people\r\n\"all singing away like devils.\" But I found he quite agreed with me in\r\nthinking that there was a visible nucleus of something like military\r\norganisation in the mob of that day, which was overborne and, as it\r\nwere, smothered by the mere mob element before it came to trying\r\nconclusions with the police.\r\n\r\nOn our way to Limerick, Colonel Turner caught sight, at a station, of\r\nFather Little, the parish priest of Six Mile Bridge, in County Clare,\r\nand jumping out of the carriage invited him to get in and pursue his\r\njourney with us, which he very politely did. Father Little is a tall\r\nfine-looking man of a Saxon rather than a Celtic type, and I daresay\r\ncomes of the Cromwellian stock. He is a staunch and outspoken\r\nNationalist, and has been made rather prominent of late by his\r\nchampionship of certain of his parishioners in their contest with their\r\nlandlord, Mr. H.V. D'Esterre, who lives chiefly at Bournemouth in\r\nEngland, but owns 2833 acres in County Clare at Rosmanagher, valued at\r\n£1625 a year. More than a year ago one of Father Little's parishioners,\r\nMr. Frost, successfully resisted a large force of the constabulary bent\r\non executing a process of ejectment against him obtained by Mr.\r\nD'Esterre.\r\n\r\nFrost's holding was of 33 Irish, or, in round numbers, about 50 English,\r\nacres, at a rental of £117, 10s., on which he had asked but had not\r\nobtained an abatement. The Poor-Law valuation of the holding was £78,\r\nand Frost estimated the value of his and his father's improvements,\r\nincluding the homestead and the offices, or in other words his\r\ntenant-right, at £400. The authorities sent a stronger body of\r\nconstables and ejected Frost. But as soon as they had left the place\r\nFrost came back with his family, on the 28th Jan. 1887, and reoccupied\r\nit. Of course proceedings were taken against him immediately, and a\r\nsmall war was waged over the Frost farm until the 5th of September last,\r\nwhen an expedition was sent against it, and it was finally captured, and\r\nFrost evicted with his family. Upon this last occasion Father Little\r\n(who gave me a very temperate but vigorous account of the whole affair)\r\ndistinguished himself by a most ingenious and original attempt to \"hold\r\nthe fort.\" He chained himself to the main doorway, and stretching the\r\nchains right and left secured them to two other doors. It was of this\r\nrefreshing touch of humour that I heard the other day at Abbeyleix as\r\nhappening not in Clare but in Kerry.\r\n\r\nSince his eviction Frost has been living, Father Little tells me, in a\r\nwooden hut put up for him on the lands of a kinsman of the same name,\r\nwho is also a tenant of Mr. D'Esterre, and who has since been served by\r\nhis landlord with a notice of ejectment for arrears, although he had\r\npaid up six months' dues two months only before the service. Father\r\nLittle charged the landlord in this case with prevarication and other\r\nevasive proceedings in the course of his negotiations with the tenants;\r\nand Colonel Turner did not contest the statements made by him in support\r\nof his contention that the Rosmanagher difficulty might have been\r\navoided had the tenants been more fairly and more considerately dealt\r\nwith. It is strong presumptive evidence against the landlord that a\r\nkinsman, Mr. Robert D'Esterre, is one of the subscribers to a fund\r\nraised by Father Little in aid of the evicted man Frost. On the other\r\nhand, as illustrating the condition of the tenants, it is noteworthy\r\nthat the Post-Office Savings Bank's deposits at Six-Mile Bridge rose\r\nfrom £382, 17s. 10d. in 1880 to £934, 13s. 4d. in 1887.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast we took a car and drove rapidly about the city for an\r\nhour. With its noble river flowing through the very heart of the place,\r\nand broadening soon into an estuary of the Atlantic, Limerick ought long\r\nago to have taken its place in the front rank of British ports dealing\r\nwith the New World. In the seventeenth century it was the fourth city of\r\nIreland, Boate putting it then next after Dublin, Galway, and Waterford.\r\nBelfast at that time, he describes as a place hardly comparable \"to a\r\nsmall market-town in England.\" To-day Limerick has a population of some\r\nforty thousand, and Belfast a population of more than two hundred\r\nthousand souls. This change cannot be attributed solely, if at all, to\r\nthe \"Protestant ascendency,\" nor yet to the alleged superiority of the\r\nNorthern over the Southern Irish in energy and thrift, For in the\r\nseventeenth century Limerick was more important than Cork, whereas it\r\nhad so far fallen behind its Southern competitor in the eighteenth\r\ncentury that it contained in 1781 but 3859 houses, while Cork contained\r\n5295. To-day its population is about half as large as that of Cork. It\r\nis a very well built city, its main thoroughfare, George Street, being\r\nat least a mile in length, and a picturesque city also, thanks to the\r\nisland site of its most ancient quarter, the English Town, and to the\r\nhills of Clare and Killaloe, which close the prospect of the surrounding\r\ncountry. But the streets, though many of them are handsome, have a\r\nneglected look, as have also the quays and bridges. One of my\r\ncompanions, to whom I spoke of this, replied, \"if they look neglected,\r\nit's because they are neglected. Politics are the death of the place,\r\nand the life of its publics.\"[2]\r\n\r\nAs we approached the shores of the Atlantic from Limerick, the scenery\r\nbecame very grand and beautiful. On the right of the railway the country\r\nrolled and undulated away towards the Stacks, amid the spurs and slopes\r\nof which, in the wood of Clonlish, Sanders, the Nuncio sent over to\r\norganise Catholic Ireland against Elizabeth, miserably perished of want\r\nand disease six years before the advent of the great Armada. To the\r\nsouth-west rose the grand outlines of the Macgillicuddy's Reeks, the\r\nhighest points, I believe, in the South of Ireland. We established\r\nourselves at the County Kerry Club on our arrival in Tralee, which I\r\nfound to be a brisk prosperous-looking town, and quite well built. A\r\nNationalist member once gave me a gloomy notion of Tralee, by telling\r\nme, when I asked him whether he looked forward with longing to a seat in\r\nthe Parliament of Ireland, that \"when he was in Dublin now he always\r\nthought of London, just as when he used to be in Tralee he always\r\nthought of Dublin.\" But he did less than justice to the town upon the\r\nLee. We left it at half-past four in the train for Killorglin. The\r\nlittle station there was full of policemen and soldiers, and knots of\r\ncountry people stood about the platform discussing the morrow. There had\r\nbeen some notion that the car-drivers at Killorglin might \"boycott\" the\r\nauthorities. But they were only anxious to turn an honest penny by\r\nbringing us on to this lonely but extremely neat and comfortable\r\nhostelry in the hills.\r\n\r\nWe left the Sheriff and the escort to find their way as best they could\r\nafter us.\r\n\r\nMrs. Shee, the landlady here, ushered us into a very pretty room hung\r\nwith little landscapes of the country, and made cheery by a roaring\r\nfire. Two or three officers of the soldiers sent on here to prevent any\r\nserious uproar to-morrow dined with us.\r\n\r\nThe constabulary are in force, but in great good humour. They have no\r\nbelief that there will be any trouble, though all sorts of wild tales\r\nwere flying about Tralee before we left, of English members of\r\nParliament coming down to denounce the \"Coercion\" law, and of risings in\r\nthe hills, and I know not what besides. The agent of the Winn property,\r\nor of Mr. Head of Reigate in Surrey, the mortgagee of the estate, who\r\nholds a power of attorney from Mr. Winn, is here, a quiet, intelligent\r\nyoung man, who has given me the case in a nut-shell.\r\n\r\nThe tenant to be evicted, James Griffin, is the son and heir of one Mrs.\r\nGriffin, who on the 5th of April 1854 took a lease of the lands known as\r\nWest Lettur from the then Lord Headley and the Hon. R. Winn, at the\r\nannual rent of £32, 10s. This rent has since been reduced by a judicial\r\nprocess to £26. In 1883 James Griffin, who was then, as he is now, an\r\nactive member of the local branch of the National League, and who was\r\nimprisoned under Mr. Gladstone's Act of 1881 as a \"suspect,\" was\r\nevicted, being then several years in arrears. He re-entered unlawfully\r\nimmediately afterwards, and has remained in West Lettur unlawfully ever\r\nsince, actively deterring and discouraging other tenants from paying\r\ntheir rents. He took a great part in promoting the refusal to pay which\r\nled to the famous evictions of last year. As to these, it seems the\r\ntenants had agreed, in 1886, to accept a proposition from Mr. Head,\r\nremitting four-fifths of all their arrears upon payment of one year's\r\nrent and costs. Mr. Sheehan, M.P., a hotel-keeper in Killarney,\r\nintervened, advising the tenants that the Dublin Parliament would soon\r\nbe established, and would abolish \"landlordism,\" whereupon they refused\r\nto keep their agreement.[3] Sir Redvers Buller, who then filled the post\r\nnow held by Sir West Ridgway, seeing this alarming deadlock, urged Mr.\r\nHead to go further, and offer to take a half-year's rent and costs. If\r\nthe tenants refused this Sir Redvers advised Mr. Head to destroy all\r\nhouses occupied by mere trespassers, such as Griffin, who, if they could\r\nhold a place for twelve years, would acquire a title under the Statute\r\nof Limitations. A negotiation conducted by Sir Redvers and Father\r\nQuilter, P.P., followed, and Father Quilter, for the tenants, finally,\r\nin writing, accepted Mr. Head's offer, under which, by the payment of\r\n£865, they would be rid of a legal liability for £6177. The League again\r\nintervened with bribes and threats, and Father Quilter found himself\r\nobliged to write to Colonel Turner a letter in which he said, \"Only\r\nseventeen of the seventy tenants have sent on their rents to Mr. Roe\r\n(the agent). Though promising that they would accept the terms, they\r\nhave withdrawn at the last moment from fulfilment.... I shall never\r\nagain during my time in Glenbehy interfere between a landlord and his\r\ntenants. I have poor slaves who will not keep their word. Now let Mr.\r\nRoe or any other agent in future deal with Glenbeighans as he likes.\"\r\nThe farms lie at a distance even from this inn, and very far therefore\r\nfrom Killorglin, and the agent, knowing that the tenants would be\r\nencouraged by Griffin and by Mr. Harrington, M.P., and others, to come\r\nback into their holdings as soon as the officers withdrew, ordered the\r\nwoodwork of several cottages to be burned in order to prevent this. This\r\nburning of the cottages, which were the lawful property of the\r\nmortgagee, made a great figure in the newspaper reports, and\r\n\"scandalised the civilised world.\" The present agent thinks it was\r\nimpolitic on that account, but he has no doubt it was a good thing\r\nfinancially for the evicted tenants. \"You will see the shells of the\r\ncottages to-morrow,\" he said, \"and you will judge for yourself what they\r\nwere worth.\" But the sympathy excited by the illustrations of the cruel\r\nconflagration and the heartrending descriptions of the reporters,\r\nresulted in a very handsome subscription for the benefit of the tenants\r\nof Glenbehy. General Sir William Butler, whose name came so prominently\r\nbefore the public in connection with his failure to appear and give\r\nevidence in a recent _cause célèbre_, and whose brother is a Resident\r\nMagistrate in Kerry, was one of the subscribers. The fund thus raised\r\nhas been since administered by two trustees, Father Quilter, P.P., and\r\nMr. Shee, a son of our brisk little landlady here, who maintain out of\r\nit very comfortably the evicted tenants. Not long ago a man in Tralee\r\ntried to bribe the agent into having him evicted, that he might make a\r\nclaim on this fund! At Killorglin the Post-Office Savings Bank deposits,\r\nwhich stood at £282, 15s. 9d. in 1880, rose in 1887 to £1299, 2s. 6d.\r\nJames Griffin, despite, or because, of the two evictions through which\r\nhe has passed, is very well off. He owns a very good horse and cart, and\r\nseven or eight head of cattle. His arrears now amount to about £240, and\r\non being urged yesterday to make a proposition which might avoid an\r\neviction, he gravely offered to pay £8 of the current half-year's rent\r\nin cash, and the remaining £5 in June, the landlord taking on himself\r\nall the costs and giving him a clean receipt! This liberal proposition\r\nwas declined. The zeal of her son in behalf of the evicted tenants does\r\nnot seem to affect the amiable anxiety of our trim and energetic hostess\r\nto make things agreeable here to the minions of the alien despotism. The\r\nofficers both of the police and of the military appear to be on the best\r\nof terms with the whole household, and everything is going as merrily as\r\nmarriage bells on this eve of an eviction.\r\n\r\nTRALEE, _Wednesday evening, Feb. 22._--We rose early at Mrs. Shee's,\r\nmade a good breakfast, and set out for the scene of the day's work. It\r\nwas a glorious morning for Washington's birthday, and I could not help\r\nimagining the amazement with which that stern old Virginian landlord\r\nwould have regarded the elaborate preparations thought necessary here in\r\nIreland in the year of our Lord 1888, to eject a tenant who owes two\r\nhundred and forty pounds of arrears on a holding at twenty-six pounds a\r\nyear, and offers to settle the little unpleasantness by paying thirteen\r\npounds in two instalments!\r\n\r\nWe had a five miles' march of it through a singularly wild and\r\npicturesque region, the hills which lead up to the Macgillicuddy's Reeks\r\non our left, and on the right the lower hills trending to the salt water\r\nof Dingle Bay. Our start had been delayed by the non-appearance of the\r\nSheriff, in aid of whom all this parade of power was made; but it turned\r\nout afterwards that he had gone on without stopping to let Colonel\r\nTurner know it.\r\n\r\nThe air was so bracing and the scenery so fine that we walked most of\r\nthe way. Two or three cars drove past us, the police and the troops\r\nmaking way for them very civilly, though some of the officers thought\r\nthey were taking some Nationalist leaders and some English\r\n\"sympathisers\" to Glenbehy. One of the officers, when I commented upon\r\nthis, told me they never had much trouble with the Irish members. \"Some\r\nof them,\" he said, \"talk more than is necessary, and flourish about; but\r\nthey have sense enough to let us go about our work without foolishly\r\ntrying to bother us. The English are not always like that.\" And he then\r\ntold me a story of a scene in which an English M.P., we will call Mr.\r\nGargoyle, was a conspicuous actor. Mr. Gargoyle being present either at\r\nan eviction or a prohibited meeting, I didn't note which, with two or\r\nthree Irish members, all of them were politely requested to step on one\r\nside and let the police march past. The Irish members touched their hats\r\nin return to the salute of the officer, and drew to one side of the\r\nroad. But Mr. Gargoyle defiantly planted himself in the middle of the\r\nroad. The police, marching four abreast, hesitated for a moment, and\r\nthen suddenly dividing into two columns marched on. The right-hand man\r\nof the first double file, as he went by, just touched the M.P. with his\r\nshoulder, and thereby sent him up against the left-hand man of the\r\ncorresponding double file, who promptly returned the attention. And in\r\nthis manner the distinguished visitor went gyrating through the whole\r\nlength of the column, to emerge at the end of it breathless, hatless,\r\nand bewildered, to the intense and ill-suppressed delight of his Irish\r\ncolleagues.\r\n\r\nOur hostess's son, the trustee of the Eviction Fund, was on one of the\r\ncars which passed us, with two or three companions, who proved to be\r\n\"gentlemen of the Press.\" We passed a number of cottages and some larger\r\nhouses on the way, the inmates of which seemed to be minding their own\r\nbusiness and taking but a slight interest in the great event of the day.\r\nWe made a little detour at one of the finest points on the road to visit\r\n\"Winn's Folly,\" a modern mediæval castle of considerable size, upon a\r\nmost enchanting site, with noble views on every side, quite impossible\r\nto be seen through its narrow loopholed and latticed windows. The castle\r\nis extremely well built, of a fine stone from the neighbourhood, and\r\nwith a very small expenditure might be made immediately habitable. But\r\nno one has ever lived in it. It has only been occupied as a temporary\r\nbarrack by the police when sent here, and the largest rooms are now\r\nlittered with straw for the use of the force. At the beginning of the\r\ncentury, and for many years afterwards, Lord and Lady Headley lived on\r\nthe estate, and kept a liberal house. Their residence was on a fine\r\npoint running out into the bay, but, I am told, the sea has now invaded\r\nit, and eaten it away. In 1809 the acreage of this Glenbehy property was\r\n8915 Irish acres or 14,442 English acres, set down under Bath's\r\nvaluation at £2299, 17s. 6d. Between 1830 and 1860 the rental averaged\r\n£5000 a year, and between these years £17,898, 14s. 5d. were expended by\r\nthe landlord in improvements upon the property. This castle, which we\r\nvisited, must have involved since then an outlay of at least £10,000 in\r\nthe place.\r\n\r\nThe present Lord Headley, only a year or two ago, went through the\r\nBankruptcy Court, and the Hon. Rowland Winn, his uncle, the titular\r\nowner of Glenbehy, is set down among the Irish landlords as owning\r\n13,932 Irish acres at a rental of £1382.\r\n\r\nAfter we passed the castle we began to hear the blowing of rude horns\r\nfrom time to time on the distant hills. These were signals to the people\r\nof our approach, and gave quite the air of an invasion to our\r\nexpedition. We passed the burned cottages of last year just before\r\nreaching Mr. Griffin's house at West Lettur. They were certainly not\r\nlarge cottages, and I saw but three of them. We found the Sheriff at\r\nWest Lettur. The police and the soldiers drew a cordon around the place,\r\nwithin which no admittance was to be had except on business; and the\r\nmyrmidons of the law going into the house with the agent held a final\r\nconference with the tenant, of which nothing came but a renewal of his\r\nprevious offer. Then the work of eviction began. There was no attempt at\r\na resistance, and but for the martial aspect of the forces, and an\r\noccasional blast of a horn from the hills, or the curious noises made\r\nfrom time to time by a small concourse of people, chiefly women,\r\nassembled on the slope of an adjoining tenancy, the proceedings were as\r\ndull as a parish meeting. What most struck me about the affair was the\r\npatience and good-nature of the officers. In the two hours and a half\r\nwhich we spent at West Lettur a New York Sheriff's deputies would have\r\nput fifty tenants with all their bags and baggage out of as many houses\r\ninto the street. In fact it is very likely that at least that number of\r\nNew York tenants were actually so ousted from their houses during this\r\nvery time.\r\n\r\nThe evicted Mr. Griffin was a stout, stalwart man of middle age,\r\ncomfortably dressed, with the air rather of a citizen than of a farmer,\r\nwho took the whole thing most coolly, as did also his women-kind. All of\r\nthem were well dressed, and they superintended the removal and piling up\r\nof their household goods as composedly as if they were simply moving out\r\nof one house into another. The house itself was a large comfortable\r\nhouse of the country, and it was amply furnished.\r\n\r\nI commented on Griffin's indifference to the bailiff, a quiet,\r\ngood-natured man.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he's quite familiar,\" was the reply; \"it's the third time he's been\r\nevicted! I believe's going to America.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! he will do very well,\" said a gentleman who had joined the\r\nexpedition like myself to see the scene. \"He is a shrewd chap, and not\r\ntroubled by bashfulness. He sat on a Board of Guardians with a man I\r\nknew four years ago, and one day he read out his own name, 'James\r\nGriffin,' among a list of applicants for relief at Cahirciveen. The\r\nchairman looked up, and said, 'Surely that is not your name you are\r\nreading, is it?' 'It is, indeed,' replied Griffin, 'and I am as much in\r\nneed of relief as any one!' Perhaps you'll be surprised to hear he\r\ndidn't get it. This is a good holding he had, and he used to do pretty\r\nwell with it--not in his mother's time only of the flush prices, but in\r\nhis own. It was the going to Kilmainham that spoiled him.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did that spoil him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it made a great man of him, being locked up. He was too well\r\ntreated there. He got a liking for sherry and bitters, and he's never\r\nbeen able to make his dinner since without a nip of them. Mrs. Shee\r\nknows that well.\"\r\n\r\nTo make an eviction complete and legal here, everything belonging to the\r\ntenant, and every live creature must be taken out of the house. A cat\r\nmay save a house as a cat may save a derelict ship. Then the Sheriff\r\nmust \"walk\" over the whole holding. All this takes time. There was an\r\nunobtrusive search for arms too going on all the time. Three ramrods\r\nwere found hidden in a straw-bed--two of which showed signs of recent\r\nuse. But the guns had vanished. An officer told me that not long ago two\r\nrevolvers were found in a corner of the thatch of a house; but the\r\ncartridges for them were only some time afterwards discovered neatly\r\npacked away in the top of a bedroom wall. It is not the ownership of\r\nthese arms, it is the careful concealment of them which indicates\r\nsinister intent. One of the constables brought out three \"Moonlighters'\r\nswords\" found hidden away in the house. One of these Colonel Turner\r\nshowed me. It was a reversal of the Scriptural injunction, being a\r\nploughshare beaten into a weapon, and a very nasty weapon of offence,\r\none end of it sharpened for an ugly thrust, the other fashioned into\r\nquite a fair grip. While I was examining this trophy there was a stir,\r\nand presently two of the gentlemen who had passed us on Mr. Shee's car\r\ncame rather suddenly out of the house in company with two or three\r\nconstables.\r\n\r\nThey were representatives, they said, of the Press, and as such desired\r\nto be allowed to remain. Colonel Turner replied that this could not be,\r\nand, in fact, no one had been suffered to enter the house except the\r\nlaw-officers, the agent, and the constables. So the representatives of\r\nthe Press were obliged to pass outside of the lines, one of the\r\nconstables declaring that they had got into the house through a hole in\r\nthe back wall!\r\n\r\nShortly after this incident there arose a considerable noise of groaning\r\nand shouting from the hill-side beyond the highway, and presently a\r\nnumber of people, women and children predominating, appeared coming down\r\ntowards the precincts of the house. They were following a person in a\r\nclerical dress, who proved to be Father Quilter, the parish priest, who\r\nhad denounced his people to Colonel Turner as \"poor slaves\" of the\r\nLeague! A colloquy followed between Father Quilter and the policemen of\r\nthe cordon. This was brought to a close by Mr. Roche, the resident\r\nmagistrate, who went forward, and finding that Father Quilter wished to\r\npass the cordon, politely but firmly informed him that this could not be\r\ndone. \"Not if I am the bearer of a telegram for the lawyer?\" asked\r\nFather Quilter, in a loud and not entirely amiable tone. \"Not on any\r\nterms whatever,\" responded the magistrate. Father Quilter still\r\nmaintaining his ground, the women crowded in around and behind him, the\r\nmen bringing up the rear at a respectable distance, and the small boys\r\nshouting loudly. For a moment faint hopes arose within me that I was\r\nabout to witness one of the .exciting scenes of which I have more than\r\nonce read. But only for a moment. The magistrate ordered the police to\r\nadvance. As they drew near the wall with an evident intention of going\r\nover it into the highway, Father Quilter and the women fell back, the\r\nboys and men retreated up the opposite hill, and the brief battle of\r\nGlenbehy was over.\r\n\r\nA small messenger bearing a telegram then emerged from the crowd, and\r\nshowing his telegram, was permitted to pass. Father Quilter, in a loud\r\nvoice, commented upon this, crying out, \"See now your consistency! You\r\nsaid no one should pass, and you let the messenger come in!\" To this\r\nsally no reply was returned. After a little the priest, followed by most\r\nof the people, went up the hill to the holding of another tenant, and\r\nthere, as the police came in and reported, held a meeting. From time to\r\ntime cries were heard in the distance, and ever and anon the blast of a\r\nhorn came from some outlying hill.\r\n\r\nBut no notice was taken of these things by the police, and when the\r\ntedious formalities of the law had all been gone through with, a squad\r\nof men were put in charge of the house and the holding, the rest of the\r\narmy re-formed for the march back, our cars came up, and we left West\r\nLettur. Seeing a number of men come down the hill, as the column\r\nprepared to move, Mr. Roche, making his voice tremendous, after the\r\nfashion of a Greek chorus, commanded the police to arrest and handcuff\r\nany riotous person making provocative noises. This had the desired\r\neffect, and the march back began in silence. When the column was fairly\r\nin the road, \"boos\" and groans went up from knots of men higher up the\r\nhill, but no heed was taken of these, and no further incident occurred.\r\nI shall be curious to see whether the story of this affair can possibly\r\nbe worked up into a thrilling narrative.\r\n\r\nWe lunched at Mrs. Shee's, where no sort of curiosity was manifested\r\nabout the proceedings at West Lettur, and I came back here with Colonel\r\nTurner by another road, which led us past one of the loveliest lakes I\r\nhave ever seen--Lough Caragh. Less known to fame than the much larger\r\nLake of Killarney, it is in its way quite worthy of comparison with any\r\nof the lesser lakes of Europe. It is not indeed set in a coronal of\r\nmountains like Orta, but its shores are well wooded, picturesque, and\r\nenlivened by charming seats--now, for the most part, alas!--abandoned by\r\ntheir owners. We had a pleasant club dinner here this evening, after\r\nwhich came in to see me Mr. Hussey, to whom I had sent a letter from Mr.\r\nFroude. Few men, I imagine, know this whole region better than Mr.\r\nHussey. Some gentlemen of the country joined in the conversation, and\r\ncurious stories were told of the difficulty of getting evidence in\r\ncriminal cases. What Froude says of the effect of the prohibitive and\r\nprotection policy in Ireland upon the morals of the people as to\r\nsmuggling must be said, I fear, of the effect of the Penal Laws against\r\nCatholics upon their morals as to perjury. It is not surprising that the\r\npeasants should have been educated into the state of mind of the\r\nIrishman in the old American story, who, being solicited to promise his\r\nvote when he landed in New York, asked whether the party which sought it\r\nwas for the Government or against it. Against it, he was told, \"Then\r\nbegorra you shall have my vote, for I'm agin the Government whatever it\r\nis.\" One shocking case was told of a notorious and terrible murder here\r\nin Kerry. An old man and his son, so poor that they lay naked in their\r\nbeds, were taken out and shot by a party of Moonlighters for breaking a\r\nboycott. They were left for dead, and their bodies thrown upon a\r\ndunghill. The boy, however, was still alive when they were found, and it\r\nwas thought he might recover. The magistrates questioned him as to his\r\nknowledge of the murderers. The boy's mother stood behind the\r\nmagistrate, and when the question was put, held up her finger in a\r\nwarning manner at the poor lad. She didn't wish him to \"peach,\" as, if\r\nhe lived, the friends of the murderers would make it impossible for them\r\nto keep their holding and live on it. The lad lied, and died with the\r\nlie on his lips. Who shall sit in judgment on that wretched mother and\r\nher son? But what rule can possibly be too stern to crush out the\r\nterrorism which makes such things possible?\r\n\r\nAnd what right have Englishmen to expect their dominion to stand in\r\nIreland when their party leaders for party ends shake hands with men who\r\nwink at and use this terrorism? It has so wrought upon the population\r\nhere, that in another case, in which the truth needed by justice and the\r\nfears of a poor family trembling for their substance and their lives\r\ncame thus into collision, an Irish Judge did not hesitate to warn the\r\njury against allowing themselves to be influenced by \"the usual family\r\nlie\"!\r\n\r\nA magistrate told us a curious story, which recalls a case noted by Sir\r\nWalter Scott, about the detection of a murderer, who lay long in wait\r\nfor a certain police sergeant, obnoxious to the \"Moonlighters,\" and\r\nfinally shot him dead in the public street of Loughrea, after dark on a\r\nrainy night, as he was returning from the Post-Office on one side of the\r\nstreet to the Police Barracks on the other. The town and the\r\nneighbouring country were all agog about the matter, but no trace could\r\nbe got until the Dublin detectives came down three days after the\r\nmurder. It had rained more or less every one of these days, and the\r\npools of water were still standing in the street, as on the night of the\r\nmurder. One of the Dublin officers closely examining the highway saw a\r\nheavy footprint in the coarse mud at the bottom of one of these pools.\r\nHe had the water drawn off, and made out clearly, from the print in the\r\nmud, that the brogan worn by the foot which made it had a broken\r\nsole-piece turned over under the foot. By this the murderer was\r\neventually traced, captured, tried, and found guilty.\r\n\r\nMr. Morphy, I find, is coming down from Dublin to conduct the\r\nprosecution in the case of the Crown against the murderers of\r\nFitzmaurice, the old man, so brutally slain the other day near Lixnaw,\r\nin the presence of his daughter, for taking and farming a farm given up\r\nby his thriftless brother. \"He will find,\" said one of the company,\r\n\"the mischief done in this instance also by prematurely pressing for\r\nevidence. The girl Honora, who saw her father murdered, never ought to\r\nhave been subjected to any inquiry at first by any one, least of all by\r\nthe local priest. Her first thought inevitably was that if she intimated\r\nwho the men were, they would be screened, and she would suffer. Now she\r\nis recovering her self-possession and coming round, and she will tell\r\nthe truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile,\" said a magistrate, \"the girl and her family are all\r\n'boycotted,' and that, mark you, by the priest, as well as by the\r\npeople. The girl's life would be in peril were not these scoundrels\r\ncowards as well as bullies. Two staunch policemen--Irishmen and\r\nCatholics both of them--are in constant attendance, with orders to\r\nprevent any one from trying to intimidate or to tamper with her. A\r\npolice hut is putting up close to the Fitzmaurice house. The Nationalist\r\npapers haven't a word to say for this poor girl or her murdered father.\r\nBut they are always putting in some sly word in behalf of Moriarty and\r\nHayes, the men accused of the murder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Furthermore,\" said another guest, \"these two men are regularly supplied\r\nwhile in prison with special meals by Mrs. Tangney. Who foots the bills?\r\nThat is what she won't tell, nor has the Head-Constable so far been able\r\naccurately to ascertain. All we know is that the friends of the\r\nprisoners haven't the money to do it.\"\r\n\r\nLate in the evening came in a tall fine-looking Kerry squire, who told\r\nus, _à propos_ of the Fitzmaurice murder, that only a day or two ago a\r\nvery decent tenant of his, who had taken over a holding from a\r\ndisreputable kinsman, intending to manage it for the benefit of this\r\nkinsman's family, came to him and said he must give it up, as the\r\nMoonlighters had threatened him if he continued to hold it.\r\n\r\nA man of substance in Tralee gave me some startling facts as to the\r\nlocal administration here. In Tralee Union, he said, there were in 1879\r\neighty-seven persons receiving outdoor relief, at a cost to the Union of\r\n£30, 17s. 11d., being an average per head of 7s. 1d., and 1879 was a\r\nvery bad year, the worst since the great famine year, 1847. A\r\nNationalist Board was elected in 1880, and a Nationalist chairman in\r\n1884. 1884 was a very good year, but in that year no fewer than 3434\r\npersons received outdoor relief, at a cost of £2534, 13s. 10d., making\r\nan average per head of 14s. 9d.! And at the present time £5000 nominal\r\nworth of dishonoured cheques of the authorities were flying all over the\r\ncounty!\r\n\r\n\"On whom,\" I asked, \"does the burden fall of these levies and\r\nextravagances?\"\r\n\r\n\"On the landlords, not on the tenants,\" he promptly replied. \"The\r\nlandlord pays the whole of the rates on all holdings of less than £4 a\r\nyear, and on all land which is either really or technically in his own\r\npossession. He also pays one-half of the rates on all the rest of his\r\nproperty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, in a case like that of Griffin's, evicted at Glenbehy, with\r\narrears going back to 1883, who would pay the rates?\"\r\n\r\n\"The landlord of course!\"[4]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORK, _Thursday, Feb. 23d._--We left Tralee this morning. It was\r\ndifficult to recognise the events yesterday witnessed by us at Glenbehy\r\nin the accounts which we read of them to-day when we got the newspapers.\r\n\r\nAs these accounts are obviously intended to be read, not in Ireland,\r\nwhere nobody seems to take the least interest in Irish affairs beyond\r\nhis own bailiwick, but in England and America, it is only natural, I\r\nsuppose, that they should be coloured to suit the taste of the market\r\nfor which they are destined. It is astonishing how little interest the\r\npeople generally show in the newspapers. The Irish make good journalists\r\nas they make good soldiers; but most of the journalists who now\r\nrepresent Irish constituencies at Westminster find their chief field of\r\nactivity, I am told, not in Irish but in British or in American\r\njournals. Mr. Roche, R.M., who travelled with us as far as Castle\r\nIsland, where we left him, was much less moved by the grotesque accounts\r\ngiven in the local journals of his conduct yesterday than by Mr.\r\nGladstone's \"retractation\" of the extraordinary attack which he made the\r\nother day upon Mr. Roche himself, and four other magistrates by name.\r\n\r\n\"The retractation aggravates the attack,\" he said.\r\n\r\nWhen one sees what a magistrate now represents in Ireland, it certainly\r\nis not easy to reconcile an inconsiderate attack upon the character and\r\nconduct of such an officer with the most elementary ideas of good\r\ncitizenship.\r\n\r\nAfter Mr. Roche left us, a gentleman in the carriage, who is interested\r\nin some Castle Island property, told us that nothing could be worse than\r\nthe state of that region. Open defiance of the moral authority of the\r\nclergy is as rife there, he says, as open defiance of the civil\r\nauthorities. The church was not long ago broken into, and the sacred\r\nvestments were defiled; and, but the other day, a young girl of the\r\nplace came to a magistrate and asked him to give her a summons against\r\nthe parish priest \"for assaulting her.\" The magistrate, a Protestant,\r\nbut a personal friend of the priest, esteeming him for his fidelity to\r\nhis duties, asked the girl what on earth she meant. She proceeded with\r\nperfect coolness to say that the priest had impertinently interfered\r\nwith her, \"assaulted her,\" and told her to \"go home,\" when he found her\r\nsitting in a lonely part of the road with her young man, rather late at\r\nnight! For this, the girl, professing to be a Catholic, actually wanted\r\nthe Protestant magistrate to have her parish priest brought into his\r\ncourt! He told the girl plainly what he thought of her conduct,\r\nwhereupon she went away, very angry, and vowing vengeance both against\r\nthe priest and against him.\r\n\r\nThis same gentleman said that at the Bodyke evictions, of which so much\r\nhas been heard, the girls and women swarmed about the police using\r\nlanguage so revoltingly obscene that the policemen blushed--such\r\nlanguage, he said, as was never heard from decent Irishwomen in the days\r\nof his youth.\r\n\r\nOf this business of evictions, he said, the greatest imaginable\r\nmisrepresentations are made in the press and by public speakers. \"You\r\nhave just seen one eviction yourself,\" he said, \"and you can judge for\r\nyourself whether that can be truly described in Mr. Gladstone's language\r\nas a 'sentence of death.' The people that were put out of these burned\r\nhouses you saw, houses that never would have needed to be burned, had\r\nHarrington and the other Leaguers allowed the people to keep their\r\npledges given Sir Redvers Buller, those very people are better off now\r\nthan they were before they were evicted, in so far as this, that they\r\nget their food and drink and shelter without working for it, and I'm\r\nsorry to say that the Government and the League, between them, have been\r\nsoliciting half of Ireland for the last six or eight years to think that\r\nsort of thing a heaven upon earth. An eviction in Ireland in these days\r\ngenerally means just this, that the fight between a landlord and the\r\nLeague has come to a head. If the tenant wants to be rid of his holding,\r\nor if he is more afraid of the League than of the law, why, out he goes,\r\nand then he is a victim of heartless oppression; but if he is\r\nwell-to-do, and if he thinks he will be protected, he takes the eviction\r\nproceedings just for a notice to stop palavering and make a settlement,\r\nand a settlement is made. The ordinary Irish tenant don't think anything\r\nmore of an eviction than Irish gentlemen used to think of a duel; but\r\nyou can never get English people to understand the one any more than the\r\nother!\"\r\n\r\nThe fine broad streets which Cork owes to the filling up and bridging\r\nover of the canals which in the last century made her a kind of Irish\r\nVenice, give the city a comely and even stately aspect. But they are not\r\nmuch better kept and looked after than the streets of New York. And they\r\nare certainly less busy and animated than when I last was here, five\r\nyears ago. All the canals, however, are not filled up or bridged over.\r\nFrom my windows, in a neat comfortable little private hotel on\r\nMorrison's Quay, I look down upon the deck of a small barque, moored\r\nwell up among the houses. The hospitable and dignified County Club is\r\nwithin two minutes' walk of my hostelry, and the equally hospitable and\r\nmore bustling City Club, but a little farther off, at the end of the\r\nSouth Mall. At luncheon to-day a gentleman who was at Kilkenny with Mr.\r\nGladstone on the occasion of his visit to that city told me a story too\r\ngood to be lost. The party were eight in number, and on their return to\r\nAbbeyleix they naturally looked out for an empty railway carriage. The\r\ntrain was rather full, but in one compartment my informant descried a\r\ndignitary, whom he knew, of the Protestant Church of Ireland, its only\r\noccupant. He went up and saluted the Dean, and, pointing to his\r\ncompanions, asked if he would object to changing his place in the train,\r\nwhich would give them a compartment to themselves. The Dean courteously,\r\nand indeed briskly, assented, when he saw that Mr. Gladstone was one of\r\nthe party.\r\n\r\nAfter the train moved off, Mr. Gladstone said, \"Was not that gentleman\r\nwho so kindly vacated his place for us a clergyman?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\" \"I hope he won't think I have disestablished him again!\"\r\n\r\nAt the next station, my informant getting out for a moment to thank the\r\nDean again for his civility, and chat with him, repeated Mr. Gladstone's\r\nremark.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" said the Dean; \"you may tell him I don't mind his disestablishing\r\nme again; for he didn't disendow me; he didn't confiscate my ticket!\"\r\n\r\nWith this gentleman was another from Kerry, who tells me there is a\r\ndistinct change for the better already visible in that county, which he\r\nattributes to the steady action of the Dublin authorities in enforcing\r\nthe law.\r\n\r\n\"The League Courts,\" he said, \"are ceasing to be the terror they used to\r\nbe.\"\r\n\r\nI asked what he meant by the \"League Courts,\" when he expressed his\r\nastonishment at my not knowing that it was the practice of the League to\r\nhold regular Courts, before which the tenants are summoned, as if by a\r\nprocess of the law, to explain their conduct, when they are charged with\r\npaying their rents without the permission of the Local League. In his\r\npart of Kerry, he tells me, these Courts used not very long ago to sit\r\nregularly every Sunday. The idea, he says, is as old as the time of the\r\nUnited Irishmen, who used to terrorise the country just in the same way.\r\nA man whom he named, a blacksmith, acted as a kind of \"Law Lord,\" and to\r\nhim the chairmen of the different local \"Courts\" used to refer cases\r\nheard before them![5]\r\n\r\nAll this was testified to openly two years ago, before Lord Cowper's\r\nCommission, but no decisive action has ever been taken by the Government\r\nto put a stop to the scandal, and relieve the tenants from this open\r\ntyranny. These Courts enforced, and still enforce, their decrees by\r\nvarious forms of outrage, ranging \"from the boycott,\" in its simplest\r\nforms up to direct outrages upon property and the person.\r\n\r\n\"This dual Government business,\" he said, \"can only end in a duel\r\nbetween the two Governments, and it must be a duel to the death of one\r\nor the other.\"\r\n\r\nTo-night at dinner I had a most interesting conversation with Mr.\r\nColomb, Assistant Inspector-General of the Constabulary, who is here\r\nengaged with Mr. Cameron of Belfast, and Colonel Turner, in\r\ninvestigating the affair at Mitchelstown. Mr. Colomb was at Killarney at\r\nthe time of the Fenian rising under \"General O'Connor\" in 1867--a rising\r\nwhich was undoubtedly an indirect consequence of our own Civil War in\r\nAmerica. Warning came to two magistrates, of impending trouble from\r\nCahirciveen. Upon this Mr. Colomb immediately ordered the arrest of all\r\npassengers to arrive that day at Killarney by the \"stage-car\" from that\r\nplace. When the car came in at night, it brought only one person--\"an\r\nawful-looking ruffian he was,\" said Mr. Colomb, \"whom, by his\r\nsquare-toed shoes, we knew to be just arrived from your side of the\r\nwater.\"\r\n\r\nHe was examined, and said he was a commercial traveller, and that he had\r\nonly one letter about him, a business letter, addressed to \"J. D.\r\nSheehan.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you any objection to show us that letter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not,\" he replied very coolly, and, taking it out of his\r\npocket, he walked toward a table on which stood a candle, as if to read\r\nit. A gentleman who was closely watching him, caught him by the wrist,\r\njust as he was putting the letter to the flame, and saved it. It was\r\naddressed to J. D. Sheehan, Esq., Killarney [Present], and ran as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n   \"_Feb. 12th, Morning_.\r\n\r\n   \"MY DEAR SHEEHAN,--I have the honour to introduce to you Captain\r\n    Mortimer Moriarty. He will be of great assistance to you, and I\r\n    have told him all that is to be done until I get to your place. The\r\n    Private _Spys_ are very active this morning. Unless they smell a\r\n    rat all will be done without any trouble.\r\n\r\n   \"Success to you. Hoping to meet soon,--Yours as ever.\r\n\r\n   \"(Signed) JOHN J. O'CONNOR.\"[6]\r\n\r\nDespatches were at once sent off to the authorities at different points.\r\nThey were all transmitted, except to Cahirciveen, the wires to which\r\nplace were found to have been cut. Mr. Colomb--who had a force of but\r\nseventeen men in the town of Killarney--saw the uselessness of trying to\r\ncommunicate with the officer at Cahirciveen, but was so strongly urged\r\nby the magistrates that he unwillingly consented to endeavour to do so,\r\nand a mounted orderly was sent. Just after this unfortunate officer had\r\npassed Glenbehy (the scene of the eviction I have just witnessed) he was\r\nshot by some of O'Connor's party, whom he tried to pass in the dark, and\r\nwho were marching on Killarney, and fell from his horse, which galloped\r\noff. He managed to crawl to a neighbouring cottage, where he was not\r\nlong after found by \"General O'Connor\" and some of his followers. The\r\nwounded man was kindly treated by O'Connor, who had him examined for\r\ndespatches, but prevented one of his men from shooting him dead, as he\r\nlay on the ground, and had his wounds as well attended to as was\r\npossible. There was no response in the country to the Kerry rising, such\r\nas it was, because the intended seizure of Chester Castle by the Fenians\r\nfailed, but O'Connor was not captured, though great efforts were made to\r\nseize him. How he escaped is not known to this day.\r\n\r\nAt that time, as always in emergencies, Mr. Colomh says the Constabulary\r\nbehaved with exemplary coolness, courage, and fidelity. His position\r\ngives him a very thorough knowledge of the force, which is almost\r\nentirely recruited from the body of the Irish people. Of late years not\r\na few men of family, reduced in fortune, have taken service in it. Among\r\nthese has been mentioned to me a young Irishman of title, and of an\r\nancient race, who is a sergeant in the force, and who recently declined\r\nto accept a commission, as his increased expenses would make it harder\r\nfor him to support his two sisters. Another constable in the ranks\r\nrepresents a family illustrious in the annals of England four centuries\r\nago.\r\n\r\nAs to the _morale_ of the force, he cites one eloquent fact. Out of a\r\ntotal of more than 13,000 men, the cases of drunkenness, proved or\r\nadmitted, average no more than fourteen a week! On many days absolutely\r\nno such cases occur. This is really amazing when one thinks how many of\r\nthe men are isolated on lonely posts all over the island, exposed to all\r\nsorts of weather, and cut off from the ordinary resources and amusements\r\nof social life.\r\n\r\nCORK, _Friday, Feb. 24th._--This morning after breakfast I met in the\r\nSouth Mall a charming ecclesiastic, whose acquaintance I made in Rome\r\nwhile I was attending the great celebration there in 1867 of St. Peter's\r\nDay. Father Burke introduced me to him after the Pontifical Mass at San\r\nPaolo fuori le Mure; and we had a delightful symposium that afternoon. I\r\nwalked with him to his lodgings, talking over those \"days long\r\nvanished,\" and the friend whose genius made them, like the suppers of\r\nPlato, \"a joy for ever.\" He is sorely troubled now by the attitude of a\r\nportion of the clergy in his part of Ireland, which is one almost of\r\nopen hostility, he says, to the moral authority of the Church, and\r\nindicates the development of a class of priests moving in the direction\r\nof the \"conventional priests,\" by whom the Church was disgraced during\r\nthe darkest days of the French Revolution of 1793.\r\n\r\nAlmost more mischievous than these men, he thinks, who must eventually\r\ngo the way of their kind in times past, are the timid priests, for the\r\nmost part parish priests, who go in fear of their violent curates, and\r\nof the politicians who tyrannise their flocks. He showed me a letter\r\nwritten to him last week by one of these, whose parish is just now in a\r\ntempest over the Plan of Campaign. Certainly a most remarkable letter.\r\nIn it the writer frankly says, \"There is no justification for the Plan\r\nof Campaign on this property.\r\n\r\n\"I assented to putting it in force here,\" he goes on, \"because I did not\r\nat the time know the facts of the case, and took them on trust from\r\npersons who, I find, have practised upon my confidence. What am I to do?\r\nI am made to appear as a consenting party now, and, indeed, an assisting\r\nagent in action, which I certainly was led to believe right and\r\nnecessary, but which upon the facts I now see involves much injustice\r\nto ---- (naming the landlord), and I fear positive ruin to worthy men and\r\nfamilies of my people. I shall be grateful and glad of your counsel in\r\nthese most distressing circumstances.\"\r\n\r\n\"What can any one do to help such a man?\" said my friend. \"The\r\nrebellious and unruly in the Church, be they priests or laymen, can only\r\nin the end damage themselves. _Tu es Petrus_; and revolt, like schism,\r\nis a devil which only carries away those of whom it gets possession out\r\nof the Church and into the sea. But a weak sentinel on the wall or at\r\nthe gate who drops his musket to wipe his eyes, that is a thing for\r\ntears!\"\r\n\r\nHe asked me to come and see him if possible in his own county, and he\r\nhas promised to send me letters to-day for priests who will he glad to\r\ntell me what they know only too well of the pressure put upon the better\r\nsort of the people by the organised idlers and mischief-makers in Clare\r\nand Kerry.\r\n\r\nTo-day at the City Club, I made the acquaintance of the Town-Clerk of\r\nCork, Mr. Alexander M'Carthy, a staunch Nationalist and Home Ruler, who\r\nholds his office almost by a sort of hereditary tenure, having been\r\nappointed to it in 1859 in succession to his father. He gave me many\r\ninteresting particulars as to the municipal history and administration\r\nof Cork, and showed me some of the responses he is receiving to a kind\r\nof circular letter sent by the municipality to the town governments of\r\nEngland, touching the recent proceedings against the Mayor. So far these\r\nresponses have not been very sympathetic. He invited me to lunch here\r\nwith him to-morrow, and visit some of the most interesting points in and\r\naround the city. Here, too, I met Colonel Spaight, Inspector of the\r\nLocal Government Board, who gives me a startling account of the increase\r\nof the public burdens. Twenty years ago there were no persons whatever\r\nseeking outdoor relief in Cork. This year, out of a total population of\r\n145,216, there are 3775 persons here receiving indoor relief, and 4337\r\nreceiving outdoor relief, making in all 8112, or nearly 6 per cent. of\r\nthe inhabitants. This proportion is swelled by the influx of people from\r\nother regions seeking occupation here, which they do not find, or simply\r\ncoming here because they are sure of relief. This state of things\r\nillustrates not so much the decay of industry in Cork as the development\r\nof a spirit of mendicancy throughout Ireland. In the opinion of many\r\nthoughtful people, this began with the Duchess of Marlborough's Fund,\r\nand with the Mansion House Fund. Colonel Spaight remembers that in\r\nStrokestown Union, Roscommon, when the guardians there received a supply\r\nof one hundred tons of seed potatoes, they distributed eighty tons, and\r\nwere then completely at a loss what to do with the remaining twenty\r\ntons. Mr. Parnell and Mr. O'Kelly, however, came to Roscommon, and the\r\nlatter made a speech out of the hotel window to the people, advising\r\nthem to apply for more, and take all they could get. \"With a stroke of a\r\npen,\" he said, \"we'll wipe out the seed rate!\" Whereupon the\r\napplications for seed rose to six hundred tons!\r\n\r\nThe Labourers Act, passed by the British Parliament for the benefit of\r\nthe Irish labourers, who get but scant recognition of their wants and\r\nwishes from the tenant farmers, is not producing the good results\r\nexpected from it, mainly because it is perverted to all sorts of\r\njobbery. Only last week Colonel Spaight had to hand in to the Local\r\nGovernment Board a report on certain schemes of expenditure under this\r\nAct, prepared by the Board of Guardians of Tralee. These schemes\r\ncontemplated the erection of 196 cottages in 135 electoral divisions of\r\nthe Union. This meant, of course, so much money of the ratepayers to be\r\nturned over to local contractors. Colonel Spaight on inspection found\r\nthat of the 196 proposed cottages, the erection of 61 had been forbidden\r\nby the sanitary authorities, the notices for the erection of 23 had been\r\nwrongly served, 20 were proposed to be erected on sites not adjoining a\r\npublic road, and no necessity had been shown for erecting 40 of the\r\nothers. He accordingly recommended that only 32 be allowed to be\r\nerected! For a small town like Tralee this proposition to put up 196\r\nbuildings at the public expense where only 32 were needed is not bad. It\r\nhas the right old Tammany Ring smack, and would have commanded, I am\r\nsure, the patronising approval of the late Mr. Tweed.\r\n\r\nI mentioned it to-night at the County Club, when a gentleman said that\r\nthis morning at Macroom a serious \"row\" had occurred between the local\r\nBoard of Guardians there and a great crowd of labourers. The labourers\r\nthronged the Board-room, demanding the half-acre plots of land which had\r\nbeen promised them. The Guardians put them off, promising to attend to\r\nthem when the regular business of the meeting was over. So the poor\r\nfellows were kept waiting for three mortal hours, at the end of which\r\ntime they espied the elected Nationalist members of the Board subtly\r\nfiling out of the place. This angered them. They stopped the fugitives,\r\nblockaded the Board-room, and forced the Guardians to appoint a\r\ncommittee to act upon their demands.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly a curious fact that, so far, in Ireland I have seen no\r\ndecent cottages for labourers, excepting those put up at their own\r\nexpense on their own property by landlords.\r\n\r\nI dined to-night at the County Club with Captain Plunkett, a most\r\nenergetic, spirited, and well-informed resident magistrate, a brother of\r\nthe late Lord Louth,--still remembered, I dare say, at the New York\r\nHotel as the only Briton who ever really mastered the mystery of\r\nconcocting a \"cocktail,\"--and an uncle of the present peer. We had a\r\nvery cheery dinner, and a very clever lawyer, Mr. Shannon, gave us an\r\nirresistible reproduction of a charge delivered by an Irish judge famous\r\nfor shooting over the heads of juries, who sent twelve worthy citizens\r\nof Galway out of their minds by bidding them remember, in a case of\r\nlarceny, that they could not find the prisoner guilty unless they were\r\nquite sure \"as to the _animus furandi_ and the _asportavit_.\"\r\n\r\n_Saturday, Feb. 25._--I had an interesting talk this morning at the\r\nCounty Club with a gentleman from Limerick on the subject of\r\n\"boycotting.\" I told him what I had seen at Edenvale of the practice as\r\napplied to a forlorn and helpless old woman, for the crime of standing\r\nby her \"boycotted\" son. \"You think this an extreme case,\" he said, \"but\r\nyou are quite mistaken. It is a typical case certainly, but it gives you\r\nonly an inadequate idea of the scope given to this infernal machinery.\r\nThe 'boycott' is now used in Ireland as the Inquisition was used in\r\nSpain,--to stifle freedom of thought and action. It is to-day the chief\r\nreliance of the National League for keeping up its membership, and\r\nsqueezing subscriptions out of the people. If you want proof of this,\"\r\nhe added, \"ask any Nationalist you know whether members of the League in\r\nthe country allow farmers who are not members to associate with them in\r\nany way. I can cite you a case at Ballingarry, in my county, where last\r\nsummer a resolution of the League was published and put on the Chapel\r\ndoor, that members of the National League were thenceforth to have no\r\ndealings or communication with any person not a member. This I saw with\r\nmy own eyes, and it was matter of public notoriety.\"\r\n\r\nI lunched at the City Club with Mr. M'Carthy. Sir Daniel O'Sullivan,\r\nformerly Mayor of Cork, whose views of Home Rule seem to differ widely\r\nfrom those of his successor, now incarcerated here, was one of the\r\ncompany. In the course of an animated but perfectly good-natured\r\ndiscussion of the Land Law question between two other gentlemen present,\r\none of them, a strong Nationalist, smote his Unionist opponent very\r\nneatly under the fifth rib. The latter contending that it was monstrous\r\nto interfere by law with the principle of freedom of contract, the\r\nNationalist responded, \"That cannot be; it must be right and legitimate\r\nto do it, for the Imperial Parliament has done it four times within\r\nseventeen years!\"\r\n\r\nI walked with Mr. M'Carthy to his apartments, where he showed me many\r\ncurious papers and volumes bearing on municipal law and municipal\r\nhistory in Ireland. Among these, two most elaborate and interesting\r\nvolumes, being the Council Books of Cork, Youghal, and Kinsale, from\r\n1610 to 1659, 1666 to 1687, and 1690 to 1800. The records for the years\r\nnot enumerated have perished, that is, for the first five or six years\r\nafter the Restoration, and for the years just preceding and just\r\nfollowing the fall of James II. These volumes take one back to the\r\ncondition of Southern Ireland immediately after English greed and\r\nintrigue had sapped the foundations of the peace which followed the\r\nsubmission of the great Earl of Tyrone, and brought about the flight to\r\nthe Continent of that chieftain, and of his friend and ally, the Earl of\r\nTyrconnell.\r\n\r\nThey give us no picture, unfortunately, of the closing years of\r\nElizabeth's long struggle to establish the English power, or of the\r\noccupation of Kinsale by the Spanish in the name of the Pope. But there\r\nis abundant evidence in them of the theological hatred which so\r\nembittered the conflict of races in Ireland during the seventeenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nIt was a relief to turn from these to a solemn controversy waged in our\r\nown times between Cork and Limerick over a question of municipal\r\nprecedence, in which Mr. M'Carthy did battle for the City of the Galley\r\nand the Towers[7] against the City of the Gateway and Cathedral dome.\r\nThe truth seems to be that King John gave charters to both cities, but\r\nto Cork twelve years earlier than to Limerick. Speaking of this contest,\r\nby the way, with a loyalist of Cork to-night, I observed that it was\r\nalmost as odd to find such a question hotly disputed between two\r\nNationalist cities as to see the champions of Irish independence\r\nmarching under the banner of the harp, which was invented for Ireland by\r\nHenry VIII.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know why you call Cork a Nationalist city,\" he replied, \"for\r\nParnell and Maurice Healy were returned for it by a clear minority of\r\nthe voters. If all the voters had gone to the polls, they would both\r\nhave been beaten.\"\r\n\r\nA curious statement certainly, and worth looking into. Mr. M'Carthy gave\r\nme also much information as to the working of the municipal system here,\r\nand a copy of the rules which govern the debates of the Town Council.\r\nOne of these might be adopted with advantage in other assemblies, to\r\nwit, \"that no member be permitted to occupy the time of the Council for\r\nmore than ten minutes.\"\r\n\r\nThere is an important difference between the parliamentary and the\r\nmunicipal constituencies of Cork. The former constituency comprises all\r\nresidents within the borough boundaries occupying premises of the\r\nrateable value of £10 a year. The municipal constituency consists of no\r\nmore than 1800 voters, divided among the seven wards which make up the\r\ncity under the \"3d and 4th Victoria,\" and which contain about 13,000 of\r\nthe 15,116 Parliamentary voters of the borough. The same thing is true\r\nin the main of nine out of the eleven municipal boroughs of Ireland\r\nincluding Dublin. The 3d and 4th Victoria was amended for Dublin in\r\n1849, so as to give that city the municipal franchise then existing in\r\nEngland, but no move in that direction was made for Cork, Waterford,\r\nLimerick, or any other municipal borough. The Nationalists have taken no\r\ninterest in the question. Perhaps they have good reason for this, as in\r\nBelfast, where the municipal franchise has been widely extended since\r\nthe present Government came into power, the democratic electorate has\r\nput the whole municipal government into the hands of the Unionists. The\r\nday being cool, though fine, Mr. M'Carthy got an \"inside car,\" and we\r\nwent off for a drive about the city. The environs of Cork are very\r\nattractive. We visited the new cemetery grounds which are very neatly\r\nand tastefully laid out. There was a conflict over them, the owners of\r\nfamily vaults staunchly standing out against the \"levelling\" tendency of\r\na harmonious city of the dead. But all is well that ends well, and now\r\ntwo handsome stone chapels, one Catholic and one Protestant, keep watch\r\nand ward over the silent sleepers, standing face to face near the grand\r\nentrance, and exactly alike in their architecture. A very pretty drive\r\ntook us to the water-works, which are extensive, well planned, and\r\nexceedingly well kept. They are awaiting now the arrival from America of\r\nsome great turbine wheels, but the engines are of English make. In the\r\ncity we visited the new Protestant cathedral of St. Finbar, a very fine\r\nchurch, which advantageously replaces a \"spacious structure of the Doric\r\norder,\" built here in the reign of George II., with the proceeds of a\r\nparliamentary tax on coals. Despite his name, I imagine that admirable\r\nprelate, Dr. England, the first Catholic bishop of my native city in\r\nAmerica, must have been a Corkonian, for he it was, I believe, who put\r\nthe cathedral of Charleston under the invocation of St. Finbar, the\r\nfirst bishop of Cork. The church stands charmingly amid fine trees on a\r\nsouthern branch of the river Lea. We visited also two fine Catholic\r\nchurches, one of St. Vincent de Paul, and the other the Church of St.\r\nPeter and St. Paul, a grandly proportioned and imposing edifice.\r\n\r\nIt was at vespers that we entered it, and found it filled with the\r\nkneeling people. This noble church is rather ignobly hidden away behind\r\ncrowded houses and shops, and the contrast was very striking when we\r\nemerged from its dim religious space and silence into the thronged and\r\nrather noisy streets. There is a statue here of Father Mathew; but what\r\nI have seen to-night makes me doubt whether the present generation of\r\nCorkonians would have erected it.\r\n\r\nAt dinner a gentleman gave us a most interesting account of the\r\npicturesque home which a man of taste, and a lover of natural history,\r\nhas made for himself at the remote seaside village of Belmullet, in\r\nMayo, the seat of the Mayo quarries, in which Mr. Davitt takes so much\r\ninterest. The sea brings in there all sorts of wreckage, and the house\r\nis beautifully finished with mahogany and other rare woods, just as I\r\nremember finding in a noble mansion in South Wales, near a dangerous\r\nhead-land, some magnificent doors and wainscotings made of that most\r\nbeautiful of the Central American woods, nogarote, which I never saw in\r\nthe United States, excepting in a superb specimen of it sent home by\r\nmyself from Corinto. This colonist of Mayo employs all the people he can\r\nget in the fisheries there, which are very rich; and the ducks and wild\r\ngeese are so numerous that he sometimes sends as far as to Wicklow for\r\nmen to capture and sell them for him. He was once fortunate enough to\r\ntrap a pair of the snow geese of the Arctic region, but Belmullet, in\r\nother respects a primeval paradise, is cursed with the small boy of\r\ncivilisation; and one of these pests of society slew the goose with a\r\nstone. The widowed gander consoled himself by contracting family ties\r\nwith the common domestic goose of the parish, and all his progeny, in\r\nother particulars indistinguishable from that familiar bird, bear the\r\nblack marks distinctive of the Arctic tribe.\r\n\r\nBelmullet, this gentleman tells me, boasts a very good little inn, kept\r\nby a Mrs. Deehan, which was honoured by a visit from Lord Carnarvon with\r\nhis wife and daughters during the Earl's Viceroyalty. This was in the\r\ncourse of a private and personal, not official tour, during which, Lord\r\nCarnarvon says, he was everywhere received with the greatest courtesy by\r\nall sorts and conditions of the people. It is an interesting\r\nillustration of the temper in which certain priests in Ireland deal with\r\nmatters of State, that when Lord Carnarvon politely invited the parish\r\npriest of Belmullet to come to see him, that functionary declined to do\r\nso. Upon this the placable Viceroy sent to know whether the priest would\r\nreceive the visit he refused to pay. The priest replied that he never\r\ndeclined to receive any gentleman who wished to see him; and the Viceroy\r\naccordingly called upon him, to the edification of the people, who\r\nafterwards listened very respectfully to a little speech which His\r\nExcellency made to them from a car. It is rather surprising that these\r\nincidents have never been adduced in proof of Lord Carnarvon's\r\ndetermination to take the Home Rule wind out of the sails of the\r\nLiberals!\r\n\r\n\r\nCORK, _Sunday, Feb. 26._--I went out to-day with Mr. Cameron to see\r\nBlarney Castle and St. Anne's Hill. Nothing can be lovelier than the\r\ncountry around Cork and the valley of the Lea. A \"light railway,\" of the\r\nsort authorised by the Act of 1883, takes you out quickly enough to\r\nBlarney, and the train was well filled. The construction of these\r\nrailways is found fault with as aggravating instead of relieving those\r\ndefects in the organisation and management of the Irish railways, which\r\nare so thoroughly and intelligently exposed in the Public Works Report\r\nof Sir James Allport and his fellow-commissioners. A morning paper\r\nto-day points this out sharply.\r\n\r\nIn the days of King William III. Blarney Castle must have been a\r\nmagnificent stronghold. It stands very finely on a well-wooded height,\r\nand dominates the land for miles around. But it held out against the\r\nvictor of the Boyne so long that, when he captured it, he thought it\r\nbest, in the expressive phrase of the Commonwealth, to \"slight\" it,\r\nlittle now remaining of it but the gigantic keep, the walls of which are\r\nsome six yards thick, and a range of ruined outworks stretching along\r\nand above a line of caverns, probably the work of the quarrymen who got\r\nout the stone for the Castle ages ago. The legend of the Blarney Stone\r\ndoes not seem to be a hundred years old, but the stone itself is one of\r\nthe front battlements of the grand old tower, which has more than once\r\nfallen to the ground from the giddy height at which it was originally\r\nset. It is now made fast there by iron clamps, in such a position that\r\nto kiss it one should be a Japanese acrobat, or a volunteer rifleman\r\nshooting for the championship of the world. There are many and very fine\r\ntrees in the grounds about the Castle, and there is a charming garden,\r\nnow closed against the casual tourist, as it has been leased with the\r\nmodern house to a tenant who lives here. In the leafy summer the place\r\nmust be a dream of beauty. An avenue of stately trees quite overarching\r\nthe highway leads from Blarney to St. Anne's Hill, the site of which, at\r\nleast, is that of an ideal sanatorium. We walked thither over hill and\r\ndale. The panorama commanded by the buildings of the sanatorium is one\r\nof the widest and finest imaginable, worthy to be compared with the\r\nprospect from the Star and Garter at Richmond, or with that from the\r\nterrace at St. Germain.\r\n\r\nSeveral handsome lodges or cottages have been built about the extensive\r\ngrounds. These are comfortably furnished and leased to people who prefer\r\nto bring their households here rather than take up their abode in the\r\nhotel, which, however, seems to be a very well kept and comfortable sort\r\nof place, with billiard and music rooms, a small theatre, and all kinds\r\nof contrivances for making the country almost as tedious as the town.\r\nThe establishment is directed now by a German resident physician, but\r\nbelongs to an Irish gentleman, Mr. Barter, who lives here himself, and\r\nhere manages what I am told is one of the finest dairy farms and dairies\r\nin Ireland. Our return trip to Cork on the \"light railway,\" with a warm\r\nred sunset lighting up the river Lea, and throwing its glamour over the\r\nvaried and picturesque scenery through which we ran, was not the least\r\ndelightful part of a very delightful excursion.\r\n\r\nAfter we got back I spent half-an-hour with a gentleman who knows the\r\ncountry about Youghal, which I propose to visit to-morrow, and who saw\r\nsomething of the recent troubles there arising out of the Plan of\r\nCampaign, as put into effect on the Ponsonby property.\r\n\r\nHe is of the opinion that the Nationalists were misled into this contest\r\nby bad information as to Mr. Ponsonby's resources and relations. They\r\nexpected to drive him to the wall, but they will fail to do this, and\r\nfailing to do this they will be left in the vocative. He showed me a\r\ncurious souvenir of the day of the evictions, in the shape of a\r\nquatrain, written by the young wife of an evicted tenant. This young\r\nwoman, Mrs. Mahoney, was observed by one of the officers, as the\r\neviction went on, to go apart to a window, where she stood for a while\r\napparently writing something on a wooden panel of the shutter. After the\r\neviction was over the officer remembered this, and going up to the\r\nwindow found these lines pencilled upon the panel:--\r\n\r\n    \"We are evicted from this house,\r\n        Me and my loving man;\r\n    We're homeless now upon the world!\r\n        May the divil take 'the Plan'!\"\r\n\r\nCORK, _Monday, Feb. 27._--A most interesting day. I left alone and early\r\nby the train for Youghal, having sent before me a letter of introduction\r\nto Canon Keller, the parish priest, who has recently become a\r\nconspicuous person through his refusal to give evidence about matters,\r\nhis knowledge of which he conceives to be \"privileged,\" as acquired in\r\nhis capacity as a priest.\r\n\r\nI had many fine views of the shore and the sea as we ran along, and the\r\nsite of Youghal itself is very fine. It is an old seaport town, and once\r\nwas a place of considerable trade, especially in wool.\r\n\r\nOliver dwelt here for a while, and from Youghal he embarked on his\r\nvictorious return to England. He seems to have done his work while he\r\nwas here \"not negligently,\" like Harrison at Naseby Field, for when he\r\ndeparted he left Youghal a citadel of Protestant intolerance. Even under\r\nCharles II they maintained an ordinance forbidding \"any Papist to buy or\r\nbarter anything in the public markets,\" which may be taken as a piece of\r\ncold-blooded and statutory \"boycotting.\" Then there was no parish priest\r\nin Youghal; now it may almost be said there is nobody in Youghal but the\r\nparish priest! So does \"the whirligig of time bring in his revenges\"!\r\n\r\nAt Youghal station a very civil young man came up, calling me by name,\r\nand said Father Keller had sent him with a car to meet me. We drove up\r\npast some beautiful grounds into the main street. A picturesque\r\nwaterside town, little lanes and narrow streets leading out of the main\r\nartery down to the bay, and a savour of the sea in the place, grateful\r\ndoubtless to the souls of Raleigh and the west country folk he brought\r\nover here when he became lord of the land, just three hundred years ago.\r\nEdmund Spenser came here in those days to see him, and talk over the\r\nevents of that senseless rising of the Desmonds, which gave the poet of\r\nthe \"Faerie Queen\" his awful pictures of the desolation of Ireland, and\r\nmade the planter of Virginia master of more than forty thousand acres of\r\nIrish land.\r\n\r\nWe turned suddenly into a little narrow wynd, and pulled up, the driver\r\nsaying, \"There is the Father, yer honour!\" In a moment up came a tall,\r\nvery fine-looking ecclesiastic, quite the best dressed and most\r\ndistinguished-looking priest I have yet seen in Ireland, with features\r\nof a fine Teutonic type, and the erect bearing of a soldier. I jumped\r\ndown to greet him, and he proposed that we should walk together to his\r\nhouse near by. An extremely good house I found it to be, well placed in\r\nthe most interesting quarter of the town. Having it in my mind to drive\r\non from Youghal to Lismore, there to make an early dinner, see the\r\ncastle of the Duke of Devonshire, and return to Cork by an evening\r\ntrain, I had to decline Father Keller's cordial hospitalities, but he\r\ngave me a most interesting hour with him in his comfortable study.\r\nFather Keller stands firmly by the position which earned for him a\r\nsentence of imprisonment last year, when he refused to testify before a\r\ncourt of justice in a bankruptcy case, on the ground that it might\r\n\"drift him into answers which would disclose secrets he was bound in\r\nhonour not to disclose.\" He does not accept the view taken of his\r\nconduct, however, by Lord Selborne, that, in the circumstances, his\r\nrefusal is to be regarded as the act of his ecclesiastical superiors\r\nrather than his own. He maintains it as his own view of the sworn duty\r\nof a priest, and not unnaturally therefore he looks upon his sentence as\r\na blow levelled at the clergy; nor, as I understood him, has he\r\nabandoned his original contention, that the Court had no right to summon\r\nhim as a witness. It was impossible to listen to him on this subject,\r\nand doubt his entire good faith, nor do I see that he ought to be held\r\nresponsible for the interpretation put by Mr. Lane, M.P., and others\r\nupon his attitude as a priest, in a sense going to make him merely a\r\n\"martyr\" of Home Rule. I did not gather from what he said that, in his\r\nmind, the question of his relations with the Nationalists or the Plan of\r\nCampaign entered into that affair at all, but simply that he believed\r\nthe right and the duty of a priest to protect, no matter at what cost to\r\nhimself, secrets confided to him as a priest, was really involved in his\r\nconsent or refusal to answer, when he was asked whether he was or was\r\nnot on a certain day at the \"Mall House\" in Youghal. Of course from the\r\nconnection of this refusal in this particular case with the Nationalist\r\nmovement, Nationalists would easily glide into the idea that he refused\r\nto testify in order to serve their cause.\r\n\r\nAs to the troubles on the Ponsonby estate, Father Keller spoke very\r\nfreely. He divided the responsibility for them between the\r\nuntractableness of the agent, and the absenteeism of the owner. It was\r\nonly since the troubles began, he said, that he had ever seen Mr.\r\nPonsonby, who lived in Hampshire, and was therefore out of touch with\r\nthe condition and the feelings of the people here. In a personal\r\ninterview with him he had found Mr. Ponsonby a kindly disposed\r\nEnglishman, but the estate is heavily encumbered, and the agent who has\r\nhad complete control of it forced the tenants, by his hard and fast\r\nrefusal of a reasonable reduction more than two years ago, into an\r\ninitial combination to defend themselves by \"clubbing\" their rents. That\r\nwas before Mr. Dillon announced the Plan of Campaign at all.\r\n\r\n\"It was not till the autumn of 1886,\" said Father Keller, \"that any\r\nquestion arose of the Plan of Campaign here,[8] and it was by the\r\ntenants themselves that the determination was taken to adopt it. My part\r\nhas been that of a peace-maker throughout, and we should have had peace\r\nif Mr. Ponsonby would have listened to me; we should have had peace, and\r\nhe would have received a reasonable rental for his property. Instead of\r\nthis, look at the law costs arising out of bankruptcy proceedings and\r\nsheriff's sales and writs and processes, and the whole district thrown\r\ninto disorder and confusion, and the industrious people now put out of\r\ntheir holdings, and forced into idleness.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the recent evictions which had taken place, Father Keller said\r\nthey had taken him as well as the people by surprise, and had thus led\r\nto greater agitation and excitement. \"But the unfortunate incident of\r\nthe loss of Hanlon's life,\" he said, \"would never have occurred had I\r\nbeen duly apprised of what was going on in the town. I had come home\r\ninto my house, having quieted the people, and left all in order, as I\r\nthought, when that charge of the police, for which there was no\r\noccasion, and which led to the killing of Hanlon, was ordered. I made my\r\nway rapidly to the people, and when I appeared they were brought to\r\npatience and to good order with astonishing ease, despite all that had\r\noccurred.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the present outlook, it was his opinion that Mr. Ponsonby, even\r\nwith the Cork Defence Union behind him, could not hold out. \"The Land\r\nCorporation were taking over some parts of the estate, and putting\r\nEmergency men on them--a set of desperate men, a kind of _enfants\r\nperdus_,\" he said, \"to work and manage the land;\" but he did not believe\r\nthe operation could be successfully carried out. Meanwhile he\r\nconfidently counted upon seeing \"the present Tory Government give way,\r\nand go out, when it would become necessary for the landlords to do\r\njustice to the rack-rented people. Pray understand,\" said Father Keller,\r\n\"that I do not say all landlords stand at all where Mr. Ponsonby has\r\nbeen put by his agent, for that is not the case; but the action of many\r\nlandlords in the county Cork in sustaining Mr. Ponsonby, whose estate is\r\nand has been as badly rack-rented an estate as can be found, is, in my\r\njudgment, most unwise, and threatening to the peace and happiness of\r\nIreland.\"[9]\r\n\r\nI asked whether, in his opinion, it would be possible for the Ponsonby\r\ntenants to live and prosper here on this estate, could they become\r\npeasant proprietors of it under Lord Ashbourne's Act, provided they\r\nincreased in numbers, as in that event might be expected. This he\r\nthought very doubtful so far as a few of the tenants are concerned.\r\n\r\n\"Would you seek a remedy, then,\" I asked, \"in emigration?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not in emigration,\" he replied, \"but in migration.\"\r\n\r\nI begged him to explain the difference.\r\n\r\n\"What I mean,\" he said, \"is, that the people should migrate, not out of\r\nIreland, but from those parts of Ireland which cannot support them into\r\nparts of Ireland which can support them. There is room in Meath, for\r\nexample, for the people of many congested districts.\"\r\n\r\n\"You would, then, turn the great cattle farms of Meath,\" I said, \"into\r\npeasant holdings?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly.\"\r\n\r\n\"But would not that involve the expropriation of many people now\r\nestablished in Meath, and the disturbance or destruction of a great\r\ncattle industry for which Ireland has especial advantages?\"\r\n\r\nTo this Father Keller replied that he did not wish to see Ireland\r\nexporting her cattle, any more than to see Ireland exporting her sons\r\nand daughters. \"I mean,\" he said, quite earnestly, \"when they are forced\r\nto export them to pay exorbitant rents, and thus deprive themselves of\r\ntheir capital or of a fair share of the comforts of life. I should be\r\nglad to see the Irish people sufficient to themselves by the domestic\r\nexchange of their own industries and products.\" At the same time he\r\nbegged me to understand that he had no wish to see this development\r\nattended by any estrangement or hostile feeling between Ireland and\r\nGreat Britain. \"On the contrary,\" he said, \"I have seen with the\r\ngreatest satisfaction the growth of such good feeling towards England as\r\nI never expected to witness, as the result of the visits here of English\r\npublic men, sympathising with the Irish tenants. I believe their visits\r\nare opening the way to a real union of the Democracies of the two\r\ncountries, and to an alliance between them against the aristocratic\r\nclasses which depress both peoples.\" This alliance Father Keller\r\nbelieved would be a sufficient guarantee against any religious contest\r\nbetween the Catholics of Ireland and the Protestants of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n\"I was much astounded,\" he said, \"the other day, to hear from an English\r\ngentleman that he had met a Protestant clergyman who told him he really\r\nbelieved that a persecution of the Protestants would follow the\r\nestablishment of Home Rule in Ireland. I begged him to consider that Mr.\r\nParnell was a Protestant, and I assured him Protestants would have\r\nabsolutely nothing to fear from Home Rule.\"\r\n\r\nReverting to his idea of re-distributing the Irish population through\r\nIreland, under changed conditions, social and economical, I asked him\r\nhow in Meath, for example, he would meet the difficulty of stocking with\r\ncattle the peasant holdings of a new set of proprietors not owning\r\nstock. He thought it would be easily met by advances of money from the\r\nTreasury to the peasant proprietors, these advances to be repaid, with\r\ninterest, as in the case of Lady Burdett Coutts, and the advances made\r\nby her to the fishermen now under the direction of Father Davis at\r\nBaltimore.\r\n\r\nI was struck by the resemblance of these views to the Irish policy\r\nsketched for me by my Nationalist fellow-traveller of the other night\r\nfrom London. \"The evil that men do lives after them\"--and when one\r\nremembers how only a hundred years ago, and just after the establishment\r\nof American Independence ought to have taught England a lesson, the\r\nIrish House of Commons had to deal with the persistent determination of\r\nthe English manufacturers to fight the bogey of Irish competition by\r\nprotective duties in England against imports from Ireland, it is not\r\nsurprising that Irishmen who allow sentiment to get the upper hand of\r\nsense should now think of playing a return game. England went in fear\r\nthen not only of Irish beasts and Irish butter, but of Irish woollens,\r\nIrish cottons, Irish leather, Irish glass. Nay, absurd as it may now\r\nseem, English ironmasters no longer ago than in 1785 testified before a\r\nParliamentary Committee that unless a duty was clapped on Irish\r\nmanufactures of iron, the Irish ironmasters had such advantages through\r\ncheaper labour and through the discrimination in their favour under the\r\nthen existing relations with the new Republic of the United States that\r\nthey would \"ruin the ironmasters of England.\"\r\n\r\nIn Ireland, as in America, the benign spirit of Free Trade is thwarted\r\nand intercepted at every turn by the abominable ghost of British\r\nProtection. What a blessing it would have been if the meddlesome\r\npalaverers of the Cobden Club, American as well as English, could ever\r\nhave been made to understand the essentially insular character of\r\nProtection and the essentially continental character of Free Trade!\r\n\r\nIt should never be forgotten, and it is almost never remembered, that\r\nwhen the Treaty of Versailles was making in 1783 the American\r\nCommissioners offered complete free trade between the United States and\r\nall parts of the British Dominions save the territories of the East\r\nIndia Company. The British Commissioner, David Hartley, saw the value of\r\nthis proposition, and submitted it at London. But King George III. would\r\nnot entertain it.\r\n\r\nWhen I rose to leave him Father Keller courteously insisted on showing\r\nme the \"lions\" of Youghal. A most accomplished cicerone he proved to be.\r\nAs we left his house we met in the street two or three of the \"evicted\"\r\ntenants, whom he introduced to me. One of these, Mr. Loughlin, was the\r\nholder of farms representing a rental of £94. A stalwart, hearty,\r\nrotund, and rubicund farmer he was, and in reply to my query how long\r\nthe holdings he had lost had been in his family, he answered, \"not far\r\nfrom two hundred years.\" Certainly some one must have blundered as badly\r\nas at Balaklava to make it necessary for a tenant with such a past\r\nbehind him to go out of his holdings on arrears of a twelvemonth. Father\r\nKeller gave me, as we left Mr. Loughlin and his friend, a leaflet in\r\nwhich he has printed the story of \"the struggle for life on the Ponsonby\r\nestate,\" as he understands it.\r\n\r\nA minute's walk brought us to Sir Walter Raleigh's house, now the\r\nproperty of Sir John Pope Hennessey. It was probably built by Sir Walter\r\nwhile he lived here in 1588-89, during the time of the great Armada; for\r\nit is a typical Elizabethan house, quaintly gabled, with charming Tudor\r\nwindows, and delightfully wainscoted with richly carved black oak. A\r\nchimney-piece in the library where Sir John's aged mother received us\r\nmost kindly and hospitably is a marvel of Elizabethan woodwork. The\r\nshelves are filled with a quaint and miscellaneous collection of old and\r\nrare books. I opened at random one fine old quarto, and found it to\r\ncontain, among other curious tracts, models of typography, a Latin\r\ncritical disquisition by Raphael Regini on the first edition of\r\nPlutarch's Life of Cicero, \"_nuper inventâ diu desideraiâ _\"--a\r\ndisquisition quite aglow with the cinquecento delight in discovery and\r\nadventure. In the grounds of this charming house stand four very fine\r\nIrish yews forming a little hollow square, within which, according to a\r\nlocal legend, Sir Walter sat enjoying the first pipe of tobacco ever\r\nlighted in Ireland, when his terrified serving-maid espying the smoke\r\nthat curled about her master's head hastily ran up and emptied a pail of\r\nwater over him. In the garden here, too, we are told, was first planted\r\nthe esculent which better deserves to be called the Curse of Ireland\r\nthan does the Nine of Diamonds to be known as the Curse of Scotland. The\r\nIrish yew must have been indigenous here, for the name of Youghal,\r\nFather Keller tells me, in Irish signifies \"the wood of yew-trees.\" A\r\nsubterranean passage is said to lead from Sir Walter's dining-room into\r\nthe church, but we preferred the light of day.\r\n\r\nThe precincts of the church adjoin the grounds and garden, and with\r\nthese make up a most fascinating poem in architecture. The churches of\r\nSt. Mary of Youghal and St. Nicholas of Galway have always been cited to\r\nme as the two most interesting churches in Ireland. Certainly this\r\nchurch of St. Mary, as now restored, is worth a journey to see. Its\r\nmassive tower, with walls eight feet thick, its battlemented chancel,\r\nthe pointed arches of its nave and aisles, a curious and, so far as I\r\nknow, unique arch in the north transept, drawn at an obtuse angle and\r\ndemarcating a quaint little side-chapel, and the interesting monuments\r\nit contains, all were pointed out to me with as much zest and\r\nintelligent delight by Father Keller as if the edifice were still\r\ndedicated to the faith which originally called it into existence. It\r\ncontains a fine Jacobean tomb of Richard, the \"great Earl of Cork,\" who\r\ndied here in September 1643. On this monument, which is in admirable\r\ncondition, the effigy of the earl appears between those of his two\r\nwives, while below them kneel his five sons and seven daughters, their\r\nnames and those of their partners in marriage inscribed upon the marble.\r\nIt was of this earl that Oliver said: \"Had there been an Earl of Cork in\r\nevery province, there had been no rebellion in Ireland.\" Several Earls\r\nof Desmond are also buried here, including the founder of the church,\r\nand under a monumental effigy in one of the transepts lies the wonderful\r\nold Countess of Desmond, who having danced in her youth with Richard\r\nIII. lived through the Tudor dynasty \"to the age of a hundred and ten,\"\r\nand, as the old distich tells us, \"died by a fall from a cherry-tree\r\nthen.\"\r\n\r\nIn the churchyard is a hillock, bare of grass, about a tomb. There lies\r\nburied, according to tradition, a public functionary who attested a\r\nstatement by exclaiming, \"If I speak falsely, may grass never grow on my\r\ngrave.\" One of his descendants is doubtless now an M.P. Mr. Cameron had\r\nkindly written from Cork to the officer in charge of the constabulary\r\nhere asking him to get me a good car for Lismore. So Father Keller very\r\nkindly walked with me through the town to the \"Devonshire Arms,\" a very\r\nneat and considerable hotel, in quest of him. On the way he pointed out\r\nto me what remains of a house which is supposed to have served as the\r\nheadquarters of Cromwell while he was here, and a small chapel also in\r\nwhich the Protector worshipped after his sort. Off the main street is a\r\nlane called Windmill Lane, where probably stood the windmill from which\r\nin 1580 a Franciscan friar, Father David O'Neilan, was hung by the feet\r\nand shot to death by the soldiers of Elizabeth because he refused to\r\nacknowledge the spiritual supremacy of the Queen. He had been dragged\r\nthrough the main street at the tail of a horse to the place of\r\nexecution. His name is one of many names of confessors of that time\r\nabout to be submitted at Rome for canonisation. We could not find the\r\nofficer I sought at the hotel, but Father Keller took me to a livery-man\r\nin the main street, who very promptly got out a car with \"his best\r\nhorse,\" and a jarvey who would \"surely take me over to Lismore inside of\r\ntwo hours and a half.\" He was as good as his master's word, and a\r\ndelightful drive it was, following the course of Spenser's river, the\r\nAwniduffe, \"which by the Englishman is called Blackwater.\" Nobody now\r\ncalls it anything else. The view of Youghal Harbour, as we made a great\r\ncircuit by the bridge on leaving the town, was exceedingly fine. Lying\r\nas it does within easy reach of Cork, this might be made a very pleasant\r\nsummer halting-place for Americans landing at Queenstown, who now go\r\nfurther and probably fare worse. One Western wanderer, with his family,\r\nFather Keller told me, did last year establish himself here, a Catholic\r\nfrom Boston, to whom a son was born, and who begged the Father to give\r\nthe lad a local name in baptism, \"the oldest he could think of.\"\r\n\r\nI should have thought St. Declan would have been \"old\" enough, or St.\r\nNessan of \"Ireland's Eye,\" or Saint Cartagh, who made Lismore a holy\r\ncity, \"into the half of which no woman durst enter,\" sufficiently\r\n\"local,\" but Father Keller found in the Calendar a more satisfactory\r\nsaint still in St. Goran or \"Curran,\" known also as St. Mochicaroen _de\r\nNona_, from a change he made in the recitation of that part of the Holy\r\nOffice.\r\n\r\nThe drive from Youghal to Lismore along the Blackwater, begins,\r\ncontinues, and ends in beauty. In the summer a steamer makes the trip by\r\nthe river, and it must be as charming in its way as the ascent of the\r\nDart from Dartmouth to Totness, or of the Eance from Dinard to St.\r\nSuliac. My jarvey was rather a taciturn fellow, but by no means\r\ninsensible to the charms of his native region. About the Ponsonby estate\r\nand its troubles he said very little, but that little was not entirely\r\nin keeping with what I had heard at Youghal. \"It was an old place, and\r\nthere was no grand house on it. But the landlord was a kind-man.\"\r\n\"Father Keller was a good man too. It was a great pity the people\r\ncouldn't be on their farms; and there was land that was taken on the\r\nhills. It was a great pity. The people came from all parts to see the\r\nBlackwater and Lismore; and there was money going.\" \"Yes, he would be\r\nglad to see it all quiet again. Ah yes! that was a most beautiful place\r\nthere just running out into the Blackwater. It was a gentleman owned it;\r\nhe lived there a good deal, and he fished. Ah! there's no such river in\r\nthe whole world for salmon as the Blackwater; indeed, there is not!\r\nEverything was better when he was a lad. There was more money going, and\r\nless talking. Father Keller was a very good man; but he was a new man,\r\nand came to Youghal from Queenstown.\"\r\n\r\nWe passed on our way the ruins of Dromaneen Castle, the birthplace of\r\nthe lively old Countess of Desmond, who lies buried at Youghal. Here,\r\ntoo, according to a local tradition, she met her death, having climbed\r\ntoo high into a famous cherry-tree at Affane, near Dromaneen, planted\r\nthere by Sir Walter Raleigh, who first introduced this fruit, as well as\r\nthe tobacco plant and the potato, into Ireland. At Cappoquin, which\r\nstands beautifully on the river, I should have been glad to halt for the\r\nnight, in order to visit the Trappist Monastery there, an offshoot of La\r\nMeilleraye, planted, I think, by some monks from Santa Susanna, of\r\nLulworth, after Charles X. took refuge in the secluded and beautiful\r\nhome of the Welds. The schools of this monastery have been a benediction\r\nto all this part of Ireland for more than half a century.\r\n\r\nLismore has nothing now to show of its ancient importance save its\r\ncastle and its cathedral, both of them absolutely modern! A hundred\r\nyears ago the castle was simply a ruin overhanging the river. It then\r\nbelonged to the fifth Duke of Devonshire, who had inherited it from his\r\nmother, the only child and heiress of the friend of Pope, Richard,\r\nfourth Earl of Cork, and third Earl of Burlington. It had come into the\r\nhands of the Boyles by purchase from Sir Walter Ealeigh, to whom\r\nElizabeth had granted it, with all its appendages and appurtenances. The\r\nfifth Duke of Devonshire, who was the husband of Coleridge's \"lady\r\nnursed in pomp and pleasure,\" did little or nothing, I believe, to\r\nrestore the vanished glories of Lismore; and the castle, as it now\r\nexists, is the creation of his son, the artistic bachelor Duke, to whom\r\nEngland owes the Crystal Palace and all the other outcomes of Sir Joseph\r\nPaxton's industry and enterprise. His kinsman and successor, the present\r\nDuke, used to visit Lismore regularly down to the time of the atrocious\r\nmurder of Lord Frederick Cavendish, and many of the beautiful walks and\r\ngroves which make the place lovely are due, I believe, to his taste and\r\nhis appreciation of the natural charms of Lismore. I dismissed my car at\r\nthe \"Devonshire Arms,\" an admirable little hotel near the river, and\r\nhaving ordered my dinner there, walked down to the castle, almost within\r\nthe grounds of which the hotel stands. It is impossible to imagine a\r\nmore picturesque site for a great inland mansion. The views up and down\r\nthe Blackwater from the drawing-room windows are simply the perfection\r\nof river landscape. The grounds are beautifully laid out, one secluded\r\ngarden-walk, in particular, taking you back to the inimitable Italian\r\ngarden-walks of the seventeenth century. In the vestibule is the sword\r\nof state of the Corporation of Youghal, a carved wooden cradle for which\r\nstill stands in the church at that place, and over the great gateway are\r\nthe arms of the great Earl of Cork, but these are almost the only\r\noutward and visible signs of the historic past about the castle. Seen\r\nfrom the graceful stone bridge which spans the river, its grey towers\r\nand turrets quite excuse the youthful enthusiasm with which the Duke of\r\nConnaught, who made a visit here when he was Prince Arthur, is said to\r\nhave written to his mother, that Lismore was \"a beautiful place, very\r\nlike Windsor Castle, only much finer.\"\r\n\r\nLismore Cathedral was almost entirely rebuilt by the second Earl of Cork\r\nthree or four years after the Restoration, and has a handsome marble\r\nspire, but there is little in it to recall the Catholic times in which\r\nLismore was a city of churches and a centre of Irish devotion.\r\n\r\nThe hostess of the \"Devonshire Arms\" gave me some excellent salmon,\r\nfresh from the river, and a very good dinner. She bewailed the evil days\r\non which she has fallen, and the loss to Lismore of all that the Castle\r\nused to mean to the people. Lady Edward Cavendish had spent a short time\r\nhere some little time ago, she said, and the people were delighted to\r\nhave her come there. \"It would be a great thing for the country if all\r\nthe uproar and quarrelling could be put an end to. It did nobody any\r\ngood, least of all the poor people.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Lismore I came back by the railway through Fermoy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORTUMNA, GALWAY, _Feb. 28._--I left Cork by an early train to-day, and\r\npassing through the counties of Cork, Limerick, Tipperary, Queen's, and\r\nKing's, reached this place after dark on a car from Parsonstown. The day\r\nwas delightfully cool and bright. I had the carriage to myself almost\r\nall the way, and gave up all the time I could snatch from the constantly\r\nvarying and often very beautiful scenery to reading a curious pamphlet\r\nwhich I picked up in Dublin entitled _Pour I'Irlande._ It purports to\r\nhave been written by a \"Canadian priest\" living at Lurgan in Ireland,\r\nand to be a reply to M. de Mandat Grancey's volume, _Chez Paddy._ It is\r\nadorned with a frontispiece representing a monster of the Cerberus type\r\non a monument, with three heads and three collars labelled respectively\r\n\"Flattery,\" \"Famine,\" and \"Coercion.\" On the pedestal is the\r\ninscription--\"1800 to 1887. Erected by the grateful Irish to the English\r\nGovernment.\" The text is in keeping with the frontispiece. In a passage\r\ndevoted to the \"atrocious evictions\" of Glenbehy in 1887, the agent of\r\nthe property is represented as \"setting fire with petroleum\" to the\r\nhouses of two helpless men, and turning out \"eighteen human beings into\r\nthe highway in the depth of winter.\" Not a word is said of the agent's\r\nflat denial of these charges, nor a word of the advice given to the\r\nagent by Sir Redvers Buller that the mortgagee ought to level the\r\ncottages occupied by trespassers, nor a word about Father Quilter's\r\nletter to Colonel Turner, branding his flock as \"poor slaves\" of the\r\nLeague, and turning them over to \"Mr. Roe or any other agent\" to do as\r\nhe liked with them, since they could not, or would not, keep their\r\nplighted faith given through their own priest.\r\n\r\nThis sort of ostrich fury is common enough among the regular drumbeaters\r\nof the Irish agitation. But it is not creditable to a \"Canadian priest.\"\r\nStill less creditable is his direct arraignment of M. de Mandat\r\nGrancey's good faith and veracity upon the strength of what he describes\r\nas M. de Mandat Grancey's amplification and distortion of a story told\r\nby himself. This was a tale of a priest called out to confess one of his\r\nparishioners. The penitent accused himself of killing one man, and\r\ntrying to kill several others. The priest, as the dreadful tale went on,\r\nmade a tally on his sleeve, with chalk, of the crimes recited. \"Good\r\nheavens! my son,\" he cried at last, \"what had all these men done to you\r\nthat you tried to send them all into eternity? Who were they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Father, they were all bailiffs or tax-collectors!\"\r\n\r\n\"You idiot!\" exclaimed the confessor, angrily rubbing at his sleeve,\r\n\"why didn't ye tell me that before instead of letting me spoil my best\r\ncassock?\"\r\n\r\nAs I happened to have the book of M. de Mandat Grancey in my\r\ndespatch-box, I compared it with the attack made upon it. The results\r\nwere edifying. In the first place, M. de Mandat Grancey does not\r\nindicate the Canadian priest as his authority. He says that he heard the\r\nstory, apparently at a dinner-table in France, from a _curé Irlandais_,\r\nwho was endeavouring to impress upon his hearers \"the sympathy of the\r\nclergy with the Land League.\" The \"Canadian priest\" now comes forward\r\nand makes it a count in his indictment against M. de Mandat Grancey that\r\nhe is described as an \"Irish curate,\" when he is in fact neither an\r\nIrishman nor a curate. What was more natural than that an ecclesiastic,\r\nclaiming to live in Ireland, and telling stories in France about the\r\nsympathy of the Irish clergy with the Land League, should be taken by\r\none of his auditors to be an Irish _curé_, particularly as the French\r\n_curé_ is, I believe, the equivalent of the Irish \"parish priest\"?\r\n\r\nIn the next place, the \"Canadian priest\" declares that the story \"is as\r\nold as the Round Towers of Ireland,\" and that M. de Mandat Grancey\r\nrepresents him as making himself the hero of the tale. As a matter of\r\nfact, M. de Mandat Grancey does nothing of the kind. On the contrary, he\r\nexpressly says that the _curé Irlandais_, who told the story, gave it to\r\nhis hearers as having occurred not to himself at all, but \"to one of his\r\ncolleagues.\" Furthermore he is at the pains to add (_Chez Paddy_, p. 43)\r\nthat the story, which was not to the taste of some of the French\r\necclesiastics who heard it, was related \"as a simple pleasantry.\"\r\n\"But,\" he adds, and this I suspect is the sting which has so exasperated\r\nthe \"Canadian priest,\" \"he gave us to understand at the same time that\r\nthis pleasantry struck the keynote of the state of mind of many Irish\r\npriests, and, he said, that he was himself the President of the League\r\nin his district.\"\r\n\r\nIn connection with Colonel Turner's statements as to the conduct of\r\nFather White at Milltown Malbay, and with the accounts given me of the\r\nconduct of Father Sheehan at Lixnaw, this side-light upon the relations\r\nof a certain class of the Irish clergy with the most violent henchmen of\r\nthe League, is certainly noteworthy. I happen to have had some\r\ncorrespondence with friends of mine in Paris, who are friends also of M.\r\nde Mandat Grarncey, about his visit to Ireland before he made it, and I\r\nam quite certain that he went there, to put the case mildly, with no\r\nprejudices in favour of the English Government or against the\r\nNationalists. Perhaps the extreme bitterness shown in the pamphlet of\r\nthe \"Canadian priest\" may have been born of his disgust at finding that\r\nthe sympathy of French Catholics with Catholic Ireland draws the line at\r\npriests who regard the assassination of \"bailiffs and tax-collectors\" as\r\na pardonable, if not positively amusing, excess of patriotic zeal.\r\n\r\nIt was late when I reached Parsonstown, known of old in Irish story as\r\nBirr, from St. Brendan's Abbey of Biorra, and now a clean prosperous\r\nplace, carefully looked after by the chief landlord of the region, the\r\nEarl of Rosse, who, while he inherits the astronomical tastes and the\r\nmathematical ability of his father, is not so absorbed in star-gazing as\r\nto be indifferent to his terrestrial duties and obligations. I have\r\nheard nothing but good of him, and of his management of his estates,\r\nfrom men of the most diverse political views. But I think it more\r\nimportant to get a look at the Clanricarde property, about which I have\r\nheard little but evil from anybody. The strongest point I have heard\r\nmade in favour of the owner is, that he is habitually described by that\r\ndumb organ of a down-trodden people, _United Ireland_, as \"the most vile\r\nClanricarde.\"\r\n\r\nI found a good car at the railway station, and set off at once for\r\nPortumna. Parsonstown was called by Sir William Petty, in his _Survey of\r\nIreland_, the _umbilicus Hiberniæ_. It is the centre of Ireland, as a\r\npoint near Newnham Paddox is of England, and the famous or infamous \"Bog\r\nof Allan\" stretches hence to Athlone. Our way fortunately took us\r\nwestward. A light railway was laid down some years ago from Parsonstown\r\nto Portumna, but it did not pay, and it has now been abandoned.\r\n\r\n\"What has become of the road?\" I asked my jarvey.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! they just take up the rails when they like, the people do.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what do they do with them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it what they do with them? Oh; they make fences of them for the\r\nbeasts.\"\r\n\r\nHe was a dry, shrewd old fellow, not very amiably disposed, I was sorry\r\nto find, towards my own country.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! it's America, sorr, that's been the ruin of us entirely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray, how is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's the storms they send; and then the grain; and now they tell me\r\nit's the American beasts that's spoiling the market altogether for\r\nIreland.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that what your member tells you?\"\r\n\r\n\"The member, sorr? which member?\"\r\n\r\n\"The member of Parliament for your district, I mean. What is his name?\"\r\n\r\n\"His name? Well, I'm not sure; and I don't know that I know the man at\r\nall. But I believe his name is Mulloy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does he live in Portumna?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no, not at all. I don't know at all where he lives, but I believe\r\nit's in Tullamore. But what would he know about America? Sure, any one\r\ncan see it's the storms and the grain that is the death of us in\r\nIreland.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I thought it was the landlords and the rents?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's in Woodford and Loughrea; not here at all. There'll be no\r\ngood till we get a war.\"\r\n\r\n\"Get a war? with whom? What do you want a war for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! it was the good time when we had the Crimean war--with the wheat\r\nall about Portumna. I'll show you the great store there was built. It's\r\nno use now. But we'll have a war. My son, he's a soldier now. He went\r\nout to America. But he didn't like it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he didn't like it. He could get no work, but to be a porter, and it\r\nwas too hard. So he came back in three months' time, and then he 'listed\r\nfor a soldier. He's over in England now. He likes it very well. He's\r\ngetting very good pay. They pay the soldiers well. There's a troop of\r\nHussars here now. They bring a power of money to the place.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do they do with the wheat lands now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, they're for sheep; they do very well. Were you ever in Australia,\r\nsorr?\" pointing to a place we were passing. \"There was a man came here\r\nfrom Australia with a pot of money, and he bought that place; but he\r\nthought he was a bigger man than he was, and now he's found himself out.\r\nI think he would have done as well to stay in Australia where he was.\"\r\n\r\nIn quite a different vein he spoke of the landlord of another large\r\nseat, and of the way in which the people, some of them, had\r\nmisbehaved--breaking open the graves of the family on the place, \"and\r\ntossing the coffins and the bones about, and all for what?\"\r\n\r\nThe view as we crossed the long and very fine bridge over the Shannon\r\nafter dusk was very striking. It was not too dark to make out the course\r\nof the broad gleaming river, and the lights of the town made it seem\r\nlarger, I daresay, than it really is. As we drove up the main street I\r\ntold my jarvey to take me to the Castle.\r\n\r\n\"To the Castle, is it?\" he replied, looking around at me with an\r\nastonished air.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"I am going to see Mr. Tener, the agent, who lives there,\r\ndoesn't he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, the new agent? Oh yes; I believe he's a very good man.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't expect to be 'boycotted' for going to the Castle, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"And why should I be? But I haven't been inside of the Castle gates for\r\ntwenty years. And--here they are!\" he cried out suddenly, pulling up his\r\nhorse just in time to avoid driving him up against a pair of iron gates\r\ninhospitably closed. It was by this time pitch dark. Not a light could\r\nwe see within the enclosure. But presently a couple of shadowy forms\r\nappeared behind the iron gates; the iron gates creaked on their hinges,\r\na masculine voice bade us drive in, and a policeman with a lantern\r\nadvanced from a thicket of trees. All this had a fine martial and\r\nadventurous aspect, and my jarvey seemed to enjoy it as much as I.\r\n\r\nWe got directions from the friendly policeman as to the roads and the\r\nlandmarks, and after once nearly running into a clump of trees found\r\nourselves at last in an open courtyard, where men appeared and took\r\ncharge of the car, the horse, and my luggage. We were in a quadrangle of\r\nthe out-buildings attached to the old residence of the Clanricardes,\r\nwhich had escaped the fire of 1826. The late Marquis for a long time\r\nhesitated whether to reconstruct the castle on the old site (the walls\r\nare still standing), or to build an entirely new house on another site.\r\nHe finally chose the latter alternative, chiefly, I am told, under the\r\nadvice of his oldest son, the late Lord Dunkellin, one of the most\r\ncharming and deservedly popular men of his time. He was a great friend\r\nand admirer of Father Burke, whom he used to claim as a Galway cousin,\r\nand with whom I met him in Rome not long before his death in the summer\r\nof 1867. His brother, the present Marquis, I have never met, but Mr.\r\nTener, his present agent here, who passed some time in America several\r\nyears ago, learning from him that I wished to see this place, very\r\ncourteously wrote to me asking me to make his house my headquarters. I\r\nfound my way through queer passages to a cheery little hall where my\r\nhost met me, and taking me into a pleasant little parlour, enlivened by\r\nflowers, and a merrily blazing fire, presented me to Mrs. Tener.\r\n\r\nMr. Tener is an Ulster man from the County Cavan. He went with his wife\r\non their bridal trip to America, and what he there saw of the peremptory\r\nfashion in which the authorities deal with conspiracies to resist the\r\nlaw seems not unnaturally to have made him a little impatient of the\r\ndilatory, not to say dawdling, processes of the law in his own country.\r\nHe gave me a very interesting account after dinner this evening of the\r\nsituation in which he found affairs on this property, an account very\r\ndifferent from those which I have seen in print. He is himself the owner\r\nof a small landed property in Cavan, and he has had a good deal of\r\nexperience as an agent for other properties. \"I have a very simple\r\nrule,\" he said to me, \"in dealing with Irish tenants, and that is\r\nneither to do an injustice nor to submit to one.\" It was only, he said,\r\nafter convincing himself that the Clanricarde tenants had no legitimate\r\nground of complaint against the management of the estate, not removable\r\nupon a fair and candid discussion of all the issues involved between\r\nthem and himself, that he consented to take charge of the property. That\r\nto do this was to run a certain personal risk, in the present state of\r\nthe country, he was quite aware.\r\n\r\nBut he takes this part of the contract very coolly, telling me that the\r\nonly real danger, he thinks, is incurred when he makes a journey of\r\nwhich he has to send a notice by telegraph--a remark which recalled to\r\nme the curious advice given me in Dublin to seal my letters, as a\r\nprotection against \"the Nationalist clerks in the post-offices.\" The\r\npark of Portumua Castle, which is very extensive, is patrolled by armed\r\npolicemen, and whenever Mr. Tener drives out he is followed by a police\r\ncar carrying two armed men.\r\n\r\n\"Against whom are all these precautions necessary?\" I asked. \"Against\r\nthe evicted tenants, or against the local agents of the League?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all against the tenants,\" he replied, \"as you can satisfy\r\nyourself by talking with them. The trouble comes not from the tenants at\r\nall, nor from the people here at Portumna, but from mischievous and\r\ndangerous persons at Loughrea and Woodford. Woodford, mind you, not\r\nbeing Lord Clanricarde's place at all, though all the country has been\r\nroused about the cruel Clanricarde and his wicked Woodford evictions.\r\nWoodford was simply the headquarters of the agitation against Lord\r\nClanricarde and my predecessor, Mr. Joyce, and it has got the name of\r\nthe 'cockpit of Ireland,' because it was there that Mr. Dillon, in\r\nOctober 1886, opened the 'war against the landlords' with the 'Plan of\r\nCampaign.' It is an odd circumstance, by the way, worth noting, that\r\nwhen these apostles of Irish agitation went to Lord Clanricarde's\r\nproperty nearer the city of Gralway, and tried to stir the people up,\r\nthey failed dismally, because the people there could understand no\r\nEnglish, and the Irish agitators could speak no Irish! Nobody has ever\r\nhad the face to pretend that the Clanricarde estates were 'rack-rented.'\r\nThere have been many personal attacks made upon Mr. Joyce and upon Lord\r\nClanricarde, and Mr. Joyce has brought that well-known action against\r\nthe Marquis for libel, and all this answers with the general public as\r\nan argument to show that the tenants on the Clanricarde property must\r\nhave had great grievances, and must have been cruelly ground down and\r\nunable to pay their way. I will introduce you, if you will allow me, to\r\nthe Catholic Bishop here, and to the resident Protestant clergyman, and\r\nto the manager of the bank, and they can help you to form your own\r\njudgment as to the state of the tenants. You will find that whatever\r\nquarrels they may have had with their landlord or his agent, they are\r\nnow, and always have been, quite able to pay their rents, and I need not\r\ntell you that it is no longer in the power of a landlord or an agent to\r\nsay what these rents shall be.\"[10]\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Dillon in that speech of his at Woodford (I have it here as\r\npublished in _United Ireland_), you will see, openly advised, or rather\r\nordered, the tenants here to club their rents, or, in plain English, the\r\nmoney due to their landlord, with the deliberate intent to confiscate to\r\ntheir own use, or, in their own jargon, 'grab,' the money of any one of\r\ntheir number who, after going into this dishonest combination, might\r\nfind it working badly and wish to get out of it. Here is his own\r\nlanguage:\"--\r\n\r\nI took the speech as reported in the _United Ireland_ of October 23rd,\r\n1886, and therein found Mr. Dillon, M.P., using these words:--\"If you\r\nmean to fight really, you must put the money aside for two\r\nreasons--first of all because you want the means to support the men who\r\nare hit first; and, secondly, because you want to prohibit traitors\r\ngoing behind your back. There is no way to deal with a traitor except to\r\nget his money under lock and key, and if you find that he pays his rent,\r\nand betrays the organisation, what will you do with him? I will tell you\r\nwhat to do with him. _Close upon his money, and use it for the\r\norganisation_. I have always opposed outrages. _This is a legal plan,\r\nand it is ten times more effective_.\"\r\n\r\nNot a word here as to the morality of the proceeding thus recommended;\r\nbut almost in the same breath in which he bade his ignorant hearers\r\nregard his plan as \"legal,\" Mr. Dillon said to them, \"_this must be done\r\nprivately, and you must not inform the public where the money is\r\nplaced_!\"\r\n\r\nWhy not, if the plan was \"legal\"? Mr. Dillon, I believe, is not a\r\nlawyer, but he can hardly have deluded himself into thinking his plan of\r\ncampaign \"legal\" in the face of the particular pains taken by his\r\nleader, Mr. Parnell, to disclaim all participation in any such plans. A\r\nyear before Mr. Dillon made this curious speech, Mr. Parnell, I\r\nremember, on the 11th of October 1885, speaking at Kildare, declared\r\nthat he had \"in no case during the last few years advised any\r\ncombination among tenants against even rack-rents,\" and insisted that\r\nany combination of the sort which might exist should be regarded as an\r\n\"isolated\" combination, \"confined to the tenants of individual estates,\r\nwho, of their own accord, without any incitement from us, on the\r\ncontrary, kept back by us, without any urging on our part, without any\r\nadvice on our part, but stung by necessity, and the terrible realities\r\nof their position, may have formed such a combination among themselves\r\nto secure such a reduction of rent as will enable them to live in their\r\nown homes.\" From this language of Mr. Parnell in October 1885 to Mr.\r\nDillon's speech in October 1886, urging and advising the tenants to\r\norganise, exact contributions from every member of the organisation, and\r\nput these contributions under the control of third parties determined to\r\nconfiscate the money subscribed by any member who might not find the\r\norganisation working to his advantage, is a rather long step! It covers\r\nall the distance between a cunning defensive evasion of the law, and an\r\nopen aggressive violation of the law--not of the land only, but of\r\ncommon honesty. One of two things is clear: either these combinations\r\nare voluntary and \"isolated,\" and intended, as Mr. Parnell asserts, to\r\nsecure such a reduction of rents as will enable the tenants, and each of\r\nthem, to live peacefully and comfortably at home, and in that case any\r\nmember of the combination who finds that he can attain his object better\r\nby leaving it has an absolute right to do this, and to demand the return\r\nof his money; or they are part of a system imposed upon the tenants by a\r\nmoral coercion inconsistent with the most elementary ideas of private\r\nright and personal freedom. This makes the importance of Mr. Dillon's\r\nspeech, that by his denunciation of any member who wishes to withdraw\r\nfrom this \"voluntary\" combination as a \"traitor,\" and by his order to\r\n\"close upon the money\" of any such member, \"and use it for the\r\norganisation,\" he brands the \"organisation\" as a subterranean despotism\r\nof a very cheap and nasty kind. The Government which tolerates the\r\ncreation of such a Houndsditch tyranny as this within its dominions\r\nrichly deserves to be overthrown. As for the people who submit\r\nthemselves to it, I do not wonder that in his more lucid moments a\r\nCatholic priest like Father Quilter feels himself moved to denounce them\r\nas \"poor slaves.\" Of course with a benevolent neutral like myself, the\r\nquestion always recurs, Who trained them to submit to this sort of\r\nthing? But I really am at a loss to see why a parcel of conspirators\r\nshould be encouraged in the nineteenth century to bully Irish farmers\r\nout of their manhood and their money, because in the seventeenth century\r\nit pleased the stupid rulers of England, as the great Duke of Ormond\r\nindignantly said, to \"put so general a discountenance upon the\r\nimprovement of Ireland, as if it were resolved that to keep it low is to\r\nkeep it safe.\"\r\n\r\nOn going back to the little drawing-room after dinner we found Mrs.\r\nTener among her flowers, busy with some literary work. It is not a gay\r\nlife here, she admits, her nearest visiting acquaintance living some\r\nseven or eight miles away--but she takes long walks with a couple of\r\nstalwart dogs in her company, and has little fear of being molested.\r\n\"The tenants are in more danger,\" she thinks, \"than the landlords or the\r\nagents\"--nor do I see any reason to doubt this, remembering the Connells\r\nwhom I saw at Edenvale, and the story of the \"boycotted\" Fitzmaurice\r\nbrutally murdered in the presence of his daughter at Lixnaw on the 31st\r\nof January, as if by way of welcome to Lord Ripon and Mr. Morley on\r\ntheir arrival at Dublin.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORTUMNA, _Feb. 29th._--Early this morning two of the \"evicted\" tenants,\r\nand an ex-bailiff of the property here, came by appointment to discuss\r\nthe situation with Mr. Tener. He asked me to attend the conference, and\r\nupon learning that I was an American, they expressed their perfect\r\nwillingness that I should do so. The tenants were quiet, sturdy,\r\nintelligent-looking men. I asked one of them if he objected to telling\r\nme whether he thought the rent he had refused to pay excessive, or\r\nwhether he was simply unable to pay it.\r\n\r\n\"I had the money, sir, to pay the rent,\" he replied, \"and I wanted to\r\npay the rent--only I wouldn't be let.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who wouldn't let you?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"The people that were in with the League.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was your holding worth anything to you?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"It was indeed. Two or three years ago I could have sold my right for a\r\nmatter of three hundred pounds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\" interrupted the other tenant, \"and a bit before that for six\r\nhundred pounds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it not worth three hundred pounds to you now?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Mr. Tener, \"for he has lost it by refusing the settlement I\r\noffered to make, and driving us into proceedings against him, and\r\nallowing his six months' equity of redemption to lapse.\"\r\n\r\n\"And sure, if we had it, no one would be let to buy it now, sir,\" said\r\nthe tenant. \"But it's we that hope Mr. Tener here will let us come back\r\non the holdings--that is, if we'd be protected coming back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, do you see,\" said Mr. Tener, \"what it is you ask me to do? You ask\r\nme to make you a present outright of the property you chose foolishly to\r\nthrow away, and to do this after you have put the estate to endless\r\ntrouble and expense; don't you think that is asking me to do a good\r\ndeal?\"\r\n\r\nThe tenants looked at one another, at Mr. Tener, and at me, and the\r\nex-bailiff smiled.\r\n\r\n\"You must see this,\" said Mr. Tener, \"but I am perfectly willing now to\r\nsay to you, in the presence of this gentleman, that in spite of all, I\r\nam quite willing to do what you ask, and to let you come back into the\r\ntitles you have forfeited, for I would rather have you back on the\r\nproperty than strangers--\"\r\n\r\n\"And, indeed, we're sure you would.\"\r\n\r\n\"But understand, you must pay down a year's rent and the costs you have\r\nput us to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! sure you wouldn't have us to pay the costs?\"\r\n\r\n\"But indeed I will,\" responded Mr. Tener; \"you mustn't for a moment\r\nsuppose I will have any question about that. You brought all this\r\ntrouble on yourselves, and on us; and while I am ready and willing to\r\ndeal more than fairly, to deal liberally with you about the arrears--and\r\nto give you time--the costs you must pay.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what would they be, the costs?\" queried one of the tenants\r\nanxiously.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that I can't tell you, for I don't know,\" said Mr. Tener, \"but they\r\nshall not be anything beyond the strict necessary costs.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if we come back would we be protected?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course you will have protection. But why do you want protection?\r\nHere you are, a couple of strong grown men, with men-folk of your\r\nfamilies. See here! why don't you go to such an one, and such an one,\"\r\nnaming other tenants; \"you know them well. Go to them quietly and sound\r\nthem to see if they will come back on the same terms with you; form a\r\ncombination to be honest and to stand by your rights, and defy and break\r\nup the other dishonest combination you go in fear of! Is it not a shame\r\nfor men like you to lie down and let those fellows walk over you, and\r\ndrive you out of your livelihood and your homes?\"\r\n\r\nThe tenants looked at each other, and at the rest of us. \"I think,\" said\r\none of them at last, \"I think ---- and ----,\" naming two men, \"would come\r\nwith us. Of course,\" turning to Mr. Tener, \"you wouldn't discover on us,\r\nsir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Discover on you! Certainly not,\" said Mr. Tener. \"But why don't you\r\nmake up your minds to be men, and 'discover' on yourselves, and defy\r\nthese fellows?\"\r\n\r\n\"And the cattle, sir? would we get protection for the cattle? They'd be\r\nmurdered else entirely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" said Mr. Tener, \"the police would endeavour to protect the\r\ncattle.\"\r\n\r\nThen, turning to me, he said, \"That is a very reasonable question. These\r\nscoundrels, when they are afraid to tackle the men put under their ban,\r\ngo about at night, and mutilate and torture and kill the poor beasts. I\r\nremember a case,\" he went on, \"in Roscommon, where several head of\r\ncattle mysteriously disappeared. They could be found nowhere. No trace\r\nof them could be got. But long weeks after they vanished, some lads in a\r\nfield several miles away saw numbers of crows hovering over a particular\r\npoint. They went there, and there at the bottom of an abandoned\r\ncoal-shaft lay the shattered remains of these lost cattle. The poor\r\nbeasts had been driven blindfold over the fields and down into this pit,\r\nwhere, with broken limbs, and maimed, they all miserably died of\r\nhunger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said one of the tenants, \"and our cattle'd be driven into the\r\nShannon, and drownded, and washed away.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must understand,\" interposed Mr. Tener \"that when cattle are thus\r\nmaliciously destroyed the owners can recover nothing unless the remains\r\nof the poor beasts are found and identified within three days.\"\r\n\r\nThe disgust which I felt and expressed at these revelations seemed to\r\nencourage the tenants. One of them said that before the evictions came\r\noff certain of the National Leaguers visited him, and told him he must\r\nresist the officers. \"I consulted my sister,\" he said, \"and she said,\r\n'Don't you be such a fool as to be doing that; we'll all be ruined\r\nentirely by those rascals and rogues of the League.' And I didn't\r\nresist. But only the other day I went to a priest in the trouble we are\r\nin, and what do you think he said to me? He said, 'Why didn't you do as\r\nyou were bid? then you would be helped,' and he would do nothing for us!\r\nWould you think that right, sir, in your country?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think in my country,\" I replied, \"that a priest who behaved in\r\nthat way ought to be unfrocked.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you pay over all your rent into the hands of the trustees of the\r\nLeague?\" I asked of one of these tenants.\r\n\r\n\"I paid over money to them, sir,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"but did you pay over all the amount of the rent, or how\r\nmuch of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! I paid as much as I thought they would think I ought to pay!\" he\r\nresponded, with that sly twinkle of the peasant's eye one sees so often\r\nin rural France.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! I understand,\" I said, laughing. \"But if you come to terms now with\r\nMr. Tener here, will you get that money back again?\"\r\n\r\n\"Divil a penny of it!\" he replied, with much emphasis.\r\n\r\nFinally they got up together to take their leave, after a long whispered\r\nconversation together.\r\n\r\n\"And if we made it half the costs?\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" said Mr. Tener good-naturedly but firmly; \"not a penny off the\r\ncosts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we'll see the men, sir, just quietly, and we'll let you know what\r\ncan be done\"; and with that they wished us, most civilly, good-morning,\r\nand went their way.\r\n\r\nWe walked in the park for some time, and a wild, beautiful park it is,\r\nnot the less beautiful for being given up, as it is, very much to the\r\nDryads to deal with it as they list. It is as unlike a trim English park\r\nas possible; but it contains many very fine trees, and grand open sweeps\r\nof landscape. In a tangled copse are the ruins of an ancient Franciscan\r\nabbey, in one corner of which lie buried together, under a monumental\r\nmound of brickwork, the late Marquis of Clanricarde and his wife. The\r\nwalls of the Castle, burned in 1826, are still standing, and so perfect\r\nthat the building might easily enough have been restored. A keen-eyed,\r\nwiry old household servant, still here, told us the house was burned in\r\nthe afternoon of January 6, 1826. There were three women-servants in the\r\nhouse--\"Anna and Mary Meehan, and Mrs. Underwood, the housekeeper\"; and\r\nthey were getting the Castle ready for his Lordship's arrival, so little\r\nof an \"absentee\" was the late Lord Clanricarde, then only one year\r\nmarried to the daughter of George Canning. The fires were laid on in the\r\nupper rooms, and Mrs. Underwood went off upon an errand. When she came\r\nback all was in flames.\r\n\r\nThe deer-park is full of deer, now become quite wild. We heard them\r\ncrashing through the undergrowth on all sides. There must be capital\r\nfishing, too, in the lake, and in the river of which it is an expansion.\r\n\r\nWhile they were getting the cars ready for a drive, came up another son\r\nof the soil. This man I found had only a small interest in the battle on\r\nthe Clanricarde estates, holding his homestead of another landlord. But\r\nhe admitted he had gone in a manner into the \"combination,\" in that he\r\nhad paid a certain, not very large, sum, which he named, to the\r\ntrustees, \"just for peace and quiet.\" He considered it gone, past\r\nrecovery; and he named another man with a small holding, but doing a\r\nconsiderable business in other ways, who had \"paid £10 or more just not\r\nto be bothered.\" Upon this Mr. Tener told me of a shopkeeper at Loughrea\r\nin a large way of business, a man with seven or eight thousand pounds,\r\nwho, finding his goods about to be seized after the agent had turned a\r\nsharp strategic corner on him, and unexpectedly got into his shop, was\r\nabout to own up to his defeat, and make a fair settlement, when the\r\nsecretary of the League appeared, and requested a private talk with him.\r\nIn a quarter of an hour the tradesman reappeared looking rather sullen\r\nand crestfallen. He said he couldn't pay, and must let the goods be\r\ntaken. So taken they were, and duly put up under the process and sold.\r\nHe bought them in himself, paying all the costs.\r\n\r\nPresently two cars appeared. We got upon one, Mr. Tener driving a\r\nspirited nag, and taking on the seat with him a loaded carbine-rifle.\r\nTwo armed policeman followed us upon the other, keeping at such a\r\ndistance as would enable them easily to cover any one approaching from\r\neither side of the roadway. It quite took me back to the delightful days\r\nof 1866 in Mexico, when we used to ride out to picnics at the Rincon at\r\nOrizaba armed to the teeth, and ready at a moment's notice to throw the\r\nfour-in-hand mule-wagons into a hollow square, and prepare to receive\r\ncavalry. As it seems to be perfectly well understood that the regular\r\nprice paid for shooting a designated person (they call it \"knocking\" him\r\nin these parts) is the ridiculously small sum of four pounds, and that\r\ntwo persons who divide this sum are always detailed by the organisers of\r\noutrage to \"knock\" an objectionable individual, it is obvious that too\r\nmuch care can hardly be taken by prudent people in coming and going\r\nthrough such a country. Fortunately for the people most directly\r\nconcerned to avoid these unpleasantnesses a systematic leakage seems to\r\nexist in the machinery of mischief. The places where the oaths of this\r\nlocal \"Mafia\" are administered, for instance, are well known. A roadside\r\nnear a chapel is frequently selected--and this for two or three obvious\r\nreasons. The sanctity of the spot may be supposed to impress the\r\nneophyte; and if the police or any other undesirable people should\r\nsuddenly come upon the officiating adepts and the expectant acolyte, a\r\ngroup on the roadside is not necessarily a criminal gathering--though I\r\ndo not see why, in such times, our old American college definition of a\r\n\"group\" as a gathering of \"three or more persons\" should not be adopted\r\nby the authorities, and held to make such a gathering liable to\r\ndispersion by the police, as our \"groups\" used to be subject to\r\nproctorial punishment. Mills are another favourite resort of the\r\nlaw-breakers. Mr. Tener tells me that a large mill between this place\r\nand Loughrea is a great centre of trouble, not wholly to the\r\ndisadvantage of the astute miller, who finds it not only brings grist to\r\nhis mill, but takes away grist from another mill belonging to a couple\r\nof worthy ladies, and once quite prosperous. It is no uncommon thing, it\r\nappears, for the same person to be put through the ceremony of swearing\r\nfidelity more than once, and at more than one place, with the not\r\nunnatural result, however, of diminishing the pressure of the oath upon\r\nhis conscience or his fears, and also of alienating his affections, as\r\nhe is expected to pay down two shillings on each occasion. Once a\r\nmember, he contributes a penny a week to the general fund. It seems also\r\nto be an open secret who the disbursing treasurers are of this fund,\r\nfrom whom the members, detailed to do the dark bidding of the\r\n\"organisation,\" receive their wage. \"A stout gentleman with sandy hair\r\nand wearing glasses\" was the description given to me of one such\r\nfunctionary. When so much is known of the methods and the men, why is it\r\nthat so many crimes are committed with virtual impunity? For two\r\nsufficient reasons. Witnesses cannot be got to testify, or trusted, if\r\nthey do testify, to speak the truth; and it is idle to expect juries of\r\nthe vicinage in nine cases out of ten will do their duty. Political\r\ncowardice having made it impossible to transfer the venue in cases of\r\nIrish crime, as to which all the authorities were agreed about these\r\npoints, from Ireland into Great Britain, it is found that even to\r\ntransfer the trial of \"Moonlighters\" from Clare or Kerry into Wicklow,\r\nfor example, has a most instructive effect, opening the eyes of the\r\npeople of Wicklow to a state of things in their own island, of which\r\nhappily for themselves they were previously as ignorant as the people of\r\nSurrey or of Middlesex. This explains the indignant wish expressed to me\r\nsome time ago in a letter from a priest in another part of Ireland, that\r\n\"martial law\" might be proclaimed in Clare and Kerry to \"stamp out the\r\nMoonlighters, those pests of society.\" That in Clare and Kerry priests\r\nshould be found not only disposed to wink at and condone the proceedings\r\nof these \"pests of society,\" but openly to co-operate with them under\r\nthe pretext of a \"national\" movement, is surely a thing equally\r\nintolerable by the Church and dangerous to the cause of Irish autonomy.\r\nThis I am glad to say is strongly felt, and has been on more than one\r\noccasion very vigorously stated by one of the most eminent and estimable\r\nof Irish ecclesiastics, the Bishop-Coadjutor of Clonfert, upon whom I\r\ncalled this morning. Dr. Healy, who is a senator of the Royal University\r\nof Ireland, and a member of the Royal Irish Academy, presides over that\r\npart of the diocese of Clonfort which includes Portumna and Woodford. He\r\nlives in a handsome and commodious, but simple and unpretentious house,\r\nset in ample grounds well-planted, and commanding a wide view of a most\r\nagreeable country. We were ushered into a well-furnished study, and the\r\nbishop came in at once to greet us with the most cordial courtesy. He is\r\na frank, dignified, unaffected man, and in his becoming episcopal\r\npurple, with the gold chain and cross, looked every inch a bishop. I was\r\nparticularly anxious to see Dr. Healy, as a type of the high-minded and\r\ncourageous ecclesiastics who, in Ireland, have resolutely refused to\r\nsubordinate their duties and their authority as ecclesiastics to the\r\nconvenience and the policy of an organisation absolutely controlled by\r\nMr. Parnell, who not only is not a Catholic, but who is an open ally and\r\nassociate of the bitterest enemies of the Catholic Church in France and\r\nin England. Protestant historians affirm that Pope Innocent was one of\r\nthe financial backers of William of Orange when he set sail from Holland\r\nto crush the Catholic faith in Great Britain and Ireland, and drive the\r\nCatholic house of Stuart into exile. But it was reserved for the\r\nnineteenth century to witness the strange spectacle of men, calling\r\nthemselves Irishmen and Catholics, deliberately slandering and assailing\r\nin concord with a non-Catholic political leader the consecrated pastors\r\nand masters of the Church in Ireland. When in order to explain what they\r\nthemselves concede to be \"the absence from the popular ranks of the best\r\nof the priesthood,\" Nationalist writers find it necessary to denounce\r\nCardinal Cullen and Cardinal M'Cabe as \"anti-Irish \"; and to sneer at\r\nmen like Dr. Healy as \"Castle Bishops,\" it is impossible not to be\r\nreminded of the three \"patriotic\" tailors of Tooley Street.\r\n\r\nBishop Healy looks upon the systematic development of a substantial\r\npeasant proprietary throughout Ireland as the economic hope of the\r\ncountry, and he regards therefore the actual \"campaigning\" of the\r\nself-styled \"Nationalists\" as essentially anti-national, inasmuch as its\r\nmethods are demoralising the people of Ireland, and destroying that\r\nrespect for law and for private rights which lies at the foundation of\r\ncivil order and of property. In his opinion, \"Home Rule,\" to the people\r\nin general, means simply ownership of the land which they are to live\r\non, and to live by. How that ownership shall be brought about peaceably,\r\nfairly, and without wrong or outrage to any man or class of men is a\r\nproblem of politics to be worked out by politicians, and by public men.\r\nThat men, calling themselves Catholics, should be led on to attempt to\r\nbring this or any other object about by immoral and criminal means is\r\nquite another matter, and a matter falling within the domain, not of the\r\nState primarily, but of the Church.\r\n\r\nAs to this, Bishop Healy, who was in Rome not very long ago, and who,\r\nwhile in Rome, had more than one audience of His Holiness by command,\r\nhas no doubt whatever that the Vatican will insist upon the abandonment\r\nand repudiation by Catholics of boycotting, and \"plans of campaign,\" and\r\nall such devices of evil. Nor has the Bishop any doubt that whenever the\r\nHoly Father speaks the priests and the people of Ireland will obey.\r\n\r\nTo say this, of course, is only to say that the Bishop believes the\r\npriests of Ireland to be honest priests, and the people of Ireland to be\r\ngood Catholics.\r\n\r\nIf he is mistaken in this it will be a doleful thing, not for the\r\nChurch, but for the Irish priests, and for the Irish people. No Irishman\r\nwho witnessed the magnificent display made at Rome this year, of the\r\nscope and power of the Catholic Church, can labour under any delusions\r\non that point.\r\n\r\nFrom the Bishop's residence we went to call upon the Protestant rector\r\nof Portumna, Mr. Crawford. The handsome Anglican church stands within an\r\nangle of the park, and the parsonage is a very substantial mansion. Mr.\r\nCrawford, the present rector, who is a man of substance, holds a fine\r\nfarm of the Clanricarde estate, at a peppercorn rent, and he is tenant\r\nalso of another holding at £118 a year, as to which he has brought the\r\nagent into Court, with the object, as he avers, of setting an example to\r\nthe other tenants, and inducing them, like himself, to fight under the\r\nlaw instead of against it. He is not, however, in arrears, and in that\r\nrespect sets a better example, I am sorry to say, than the Catholic\r\npriest, Father Coen, who made himself so conspicuous here on the\r\noccasion of the much bewritten Woodford evictions. The case of Father\r\nCoen is most instructive, and most unpleasant. He occupies an excellent\r\nhouse on a holding of twenty-three acres of good laud, with a garden--in\r\nshort, a handsome country residence, which was provided by the late Lord\r\nClanricarde, expressly for the accommodation of whoever might be the\r\nCatholic priest in that part of his estate. For all this the rent is\r\nfixed at the absurd and nominal sum of two guineas a year! Yet Father\r\nCoen, who now enjoys the mansion, and has a substantial income from the\r\nparish, is actually two years and a half in arrears with this rent! This\r\nfact Mr. Tener mentioned to the Bishop, whose countenance naturally\r\ndarkened. \"What am I to do in such a case, my lord?\" asked Mr. Tener.\r\n\"Do?\" said the Bishop, \"do your plain duty, and proceed against him\r\naccording to law.\" But suppose he were proceeded against and evicted, as\r\nin America he certainly would be, who can doubt that he would instantly\r\nbe paraded, before the world, on both sides of the Atlantic as a\r\n\"martyr,\" suffering for the holy cause of an oppressed and down-trodden\r\npeople, at the hands of a \"most vile\" Marquis, and of a remorse-less and\r\nblood-thirsty agent?[11] Mr. Crawford, a tall, fine-looking man, talked\r\nvery fully and freely about the situation here. He came to Portumna\r\nabout eight years ago; one of his reasons for accepting the position\r\nhere offered him being that he wished to take over a piece of property\r\nnear Woodford from his brother-in-law, who found he could not manage it.\r\nAs a practical farmer, and a straightforward capable man of business, he\r\nhas gradually acquired the general confidence of the tenants here. That\r\nthey are, as a rule, quite able to pay the rents which they have been\r\n\"coerced\" into refusing to pay, he fully believes. He told me of cases\r\nin which Catholic tenants of Lord Clanricarde came to him when the\r\nagitation began about the Plan of Campaign, and begged him privately to\r\ntake the money for their rents, and hold it for them till the time\r\nshould come for a settlement.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this was that they did not wish to be obliged to give\r\nover the money into the \"Trust\" created by the Campaigners, and wanted\r\nit to be safely put beyond the reach of these obliging \"friends.\" One\r\nvery shrewd tenant came to him and begged him to buy some beasts, in\r\norder that he might pay his rent out of the proceeds. The man owed £15\r\nto the Clanricarde property. Mr. Crawford did not particularly want to\r\nbuy his beasts, but eventually agreed to do so, and gave him £50 for\r\nthem. The man went off with the money, but he never paid the rent! Mr.\r\nCrawford discovering this called him to account, and refused to grant\r\nhim some further favour which he asked. The result is that the\r\n\"distressed tenant\" now cuts Mr. Crawford when he meets him, and is the\r\nprosperous owner of quite a small herd of cattle.\r\n\r\nMr. Crawford's opinion of the mischief done by the methods and spirit of\r\nthe National League in this place is quite in accord with the opinions\r\nof the Bishop-Coadjutor. Power without responsibility, which made the\r\nCæesars madmen, easily turns the heads of village tyrants, and there is\r\nsomething positively grotesque in the excesses of this subterranean\r\n\"Home Rule.\" Mr. Crawford told me of a case here, in which a tenant\r\nfarmer, whom he named, came to him in great wrath, not unmingled with\r\nterror, to say that the League had ordered him, on pain of being\r\nboycotted, to give up his holding to the heirs of a woman from whom,\r\ntwenty years ago, he had bought, for £100 in cash, the tenant-right of\r\nher deceased husband! There was no question of refunding the £100. He\r\nwas merely to consider himself a \"land-grabber,\" and evict himself for\r\nthe benefit of those heirs who had never done a stroke of work on the\r\nproperty for twenty years, and who had no shadow of a legal or moral\r\nclaim on it, except that the oldest of them was an active member of the\r\nlocal League!\r\n\r\nNor was this unique.\r\n\r\nIn another case, the children of a tenant, who died forty years ago,\r\ncame forward and called upon the League to boycott an old man who had\r\nbeen in possession of the holding during nearly half a century. In a\r\nthird case, a tenant-farmer, some ten years ago, had in his employ as\r\nherd a man who fell ill and died. He put into the vacant place an\r\nhonest, capable young fellow, who still holds it, and has faithfully and\r\nefficiently served him. Only the other day this tenant-farmer was warned\r\nby the League to expect trouble, unless he dismissed this herd, and put\r\ninto his place the son, now grown to man's estate, of the herd who died\r\nten years ago!\r\n\r\nIt is amusing, if not instructive, to find the hereditary principle,\r\njust now threatened in its application to the British Senate, cropping\r\nout afresh as an element in the regeneration of Irish agriculture and\r\nthe land tenure of Ireland!\r\n\r\nOn our way back to the Castle we called on Mr. Place, the manager of the\r\nPortumna Branch of the Hibernian Bank, who lives in the town. He was\r\namusing himself, after the labour of the day in the bank, with some\r\namateur work as a carpenter, but received us very cordially. He said\r\nthere was no doubt that the deposits in the bank had increased\r\nconsiderably since the adoption of the Plan of Campaign on the\r\nClanricarde property. Money was paid into the bank continually by\r\npersons who wished the fact of their payments kept secret; and he knew\r\nof more than one case in which tenants, whose stock had been seized by\r\nthe agent for the rents, were much delighted at the seizure, since it\r\nhad paid off their rents, and so enabled them to retain their holdings\r\nand keep out of the grasp of the League, even though to do this they had\r\nundergone a forced sale and been muleted in costs.\r\n\r\nIt was his opinion that the tenants on the Clanricarde property, who are\r\nnot in arrears, would gladly accept a twenty-five per cent. reduction,\r\nand do very well by accepting it. But they are constrained into a\r\nhostile attitude by the tenants who are in arrears, some of them for\r\nseveral years (as, for example, Father Coen), although I find, to my\r\nastonishment, that in Ireland the landlord has no power to distrain for\r\nmore than a twelvemonth's rent, no matter how far back the arrears may\r\nrun.\r\n\r\nMr. Place seems to think it would be well to put all the creditors of\r\nthe tenants on one footing with the landlords. The shopkeepers and other\r\ncreditors, he thinks, in that event would see many things in quite a new\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nWhat is called the new Castle of Portumna is a large and handsome\r\nbuilding of the Mansard type, standing on an eminence in the park, at\r\nsome distance from the original seat. The building was finished not long\r\nbefore the death of his father, the late Marquis. It has never been\r\noccupied, save by a large force of police quartered in it not very long\r\nago by Mr. Tener in readiness for an expedition against the Castle of\r\nCloondadauv, to the scene of which he promises to drive me to-morrow on\r\nmy way back to Dublin. It is thoroughly well built, and might easily be\r\nmade a most delightful residence. The views which it commands of the\r\nShannon are magnificent, and there are many fine trees about it.\r\n\r\nThe old man who has charge of it is a typical Galway retainer of the old\r\nschool. The \"boys,\" he says, once tried to \"boycott\" him because he was\r\nthe pound-master; but he showed fight, and they let him alone. He\r\npointed out to me from the top of the house, in the distance, the\r\nresidences of Colonel Hickie, and of the young Lord Avonmore, who lately\r\nsucceeded on the death of his brother in the recent Egyptian expedition.\r\nThe place is now shut up, and the owners live in France.\r\n\r\nWe visited too the Portumna Union before driving home. The buildings of\r\nthis Union are extensive for the place, and well built, and it seems to\r\nbe well-ordered and neatly kept--thanks, in no small degree, I suspect,\r\nto the influence of the Sisters who have charge of the hospital, but\r\nwhose benign spirit shows itself not only in the flower-garden which\r\nthey have called into being, but in many details of the administration\r\nbeyond their special control.\r\n\r\nThe contrast was very striking between the atmosphere of this\r\nunpretending refuge of the helpless and that of certain of the\r\n\"laicised\" hospitals of France, which I not long ago visited, from which\r\nthe devoted nuns have been expelled to make way for hired nurses. I made\r\na remark to this effect to the clerk of the Union, Mr. Lavan, whom we\r\nfound in his office.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" he said, \"I have no doubt of that. We owe more than I can say\r\nto the Sisters, but I don't know how long we should have them here if\r\nthe local guardians could have their way.\"\r\n\r\nIn explanation of this, he went on to tell me that these local\r\nguardians, who are elected, are hostile to the whole administration,\r\nbecause of its relations with the Local Government Board at Dublin,\r\nwhich controls their generous tendency to expend the money of the\r\nratepayers. By way of expressing their feelings, therefore, they have\r\nbeen trying to cut down, not only the salary of the clerk, but that of\r\nthe Catholic chaplain of the Union; and as there is a good deal of\r\nirreligious feeling among the agitators here, it is his impression that\r\nthey would make things disagreeable for the Sisters also were they in\r\nany way to get the management into their own hands. That there cannot be\r\nmuch real distress in this neighbourhood appears from two facts. There\r\nare now but 130 inmates of this Union, out of a population of 12,900,\r\nand the outlay for out-of-door relief averages between eight and ten\r\npounds a week.\r\n\r\nIn the quiet, neat chapel two or three of the inmates were kneeling at\r\nprayers; and others whom we saw in the kitchen and about the offices had\r\nnothing of the \"workhouse\" look which is so painful in the ordinary\r\ninmates of an English or American almshouse.\r\n\r\n\"The trouble with the place,\" said Mr. Lavan, \"is that they like it too\r\nwell. It takes an eviction almost to get them out of it.\"\r\n\r\nWe sat down with Mr. Lavan in his office, and had an interesting talk\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nHe is the agent of Mr. Mathews, who lives between Woodford and Portumna.\r\nMr. Mathews is a resident landlord, he says, who has constantly employed\r\nand has lived on friendly terms with his tenants, numbering twenty, who\r\nhold now under judicial rents. On these judicial rents two years ago\r\nthey were allowed a further reduction of 15 per cent. Last year they\r\nwere allowed 20 per cent. This year he offered them a reduction of 25\r\nper cent., which they rejected, demanding 35 per cent.\r\n\r\nThis demand Mr. Lavan considers to be unreasonable in the extreme, and\r\nhe attributes it to the influence of the National Leaguers here, whose\r\nrepresentatives among the local guardians constantly vote away the money\r\nof the ratepayers in \"relief to evicted tenants who have ample means and\r\ncan in no respect be called destitute.\" In his opinion the effect of the\r\nNationalist agitation here has been to upset all ideas of right and\r\nwrong in the minds of the people where any question arises between\r\ntenants and landlords. He told a story, confirmed by Mr. Tener, of a\r\nbailiff, whom he named, on the Clanricarde property here, who was\r\ncompelled two years ago to resign his place in order to prevent the\r\n\"boycotting\" of his mother who keeps a shop on the farm. He was\r\nfamiliar, too, with the details of a story told me by one of the\r\nClanricarde tenants, a farmer near Loughrea who holds a farm at £90 a\r\nyear. This man was forced to subscribe to the Plan of Campaign. The\r\nagent proceeded against him for the rent due, and he incurred costs of\r\n£10. His sheep and crop were then seized.\r\n\r\nHe begged the local leaders to \"permit\" him to pay his rent, as he was\r\nable to do it _without drawing out the funds in their hands_! They\r\nrefused, and so compelled him to allow his property to be publicly sold,\r\nand to incur further costs of £10. \"His farm lies so near the town that\r\nhe did not dare to risk the vengeance of the local ruffians.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lavan gave me the name also of another man who is now actually under\r\na \"boycott,\" because he has ventured to resist the modest demand made by\r\nthe son of a man whose tenant-right he bought, paying him £100 for it,\r\ntwenty years ago, that he shall give up his farm without being\r\nreimbursed for his outlay made to purchase it! In other words, after\r\ntwenty years' peaceable possession of a piece of property, bought and\r\npaid for, this tenant-farmer is treated as a \"land-grabber\" by the\r\nself-installed \"Nationalist\" government of Ireland, because he will not\r\nsubmit to be robbed both of the money which he paid for his\r\ntenant-right, and of his tenant-right!\r\n\r\nObviously in such a case as this the \"war against landlordism\" is simply\r\na war against property and against private rights. Priests of the\r\nCatholic Church who not only countenance but aid and abet such\r\nproceedings certainly go even beyond Dr. M'Glynn. Dr. M'Glynn, so far as\r\nI know, stops at the confiscation of all private property in rent by the\r\nState for the State. But here is simply a confiscation of the property\r\nof A for the benefit of B, such as might happen if B, being armed and\r\nmeeting A unarmed in a forest, should confiscate the watch and chain of\r\nA, bought by A of B's lamented but unthrifty father twenty years before!\r\n\r\nAfter dinner to-night Mr. Tener gave me some interesting and edifying\r\naccounts of his experience in other parts of Ireland.\r\n\r\nSome time ago, before the Plan of Campaign was adopted, one of his\r\ntenants in Cavan came to him with a doleful story of the bad times and\r\nthe low prices, and wound up by saying he could pay no more than half a\r\nyear's rent.\r\n\r\n\"Now his rent had been reduced under the Land Act,\" said Mr, Tener, \"and\r\nI had voluntarily thrown off a lot of arrears, so I looked at him\r\nquietly and said, 'Mickey, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. You have\r\nbeen very well treated, and you can perfectly well pay your rent. Your\r\nwife would be ashamed of you if she knew you were trying to get out of\r\nit.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah no, your honour!\" he briskly replied; \"indade she would approve it.\r\nIf you won't discover on me, I'll tell you the truth. It was the wife\r\nherself, she's a great schollard, and reads the papers, that tould me\r\nnot to pay you more than half the rent--for she says there's a new Act\r\ncoming to wipe it all out. Will you take the half-year?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I will not. Don't be afraid of your wife, but pay what you owe,\r\nlike a man. You've got the money there in your pocket.\"\r\n\r\nThis was a good shot. Mickey couldn't resist it, and his countenance\r\nbroke into a broad smile.\r\n\r\n\"Ah no! I've got it in two pockets. Begorra, it was the wife herself\r\nmade up the money in two parcels, and she put one into each pocket, to\r\nbe sure--and I wasn't to give your honour but one, if you would take it.\r\nBut there's the money, and I daresay it's all for the best.\"\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, when he was collecting the rents of a property in\r\nthe county of Longford, one tenant came forward as the spokesman of the\r\nrest, admitted that the rents had been accepted fairly after a reduction\r\nunder the Land Act, expressed the general wish of the tenants to meet\r\ntheir obligations, and wound up by asking a further abatement, \"the\r\ntimes were so bad, and the money couldn't be got, it couldn't indeed!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Tener listened patiently--to listen patiently is the most essential\r\nquality of an agent in Ireland--and finally said:--\r\n\r\n\"Very well, if you haven't got the money to pay in full, pay\r\nthree-quarters of it, and I'll give you time for the rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank your honour!\" said Pat, \"and that'll be thirty pounds--and here\r\nit is in one pound notes, and hard enough to get they are, these times!\"\r\n\r\nSo Mr. Tener took the money, counted the notes twice over, and then,\r\nwriting out a receipt, handed it to the tenant.\r\n\r\n\"All right, Pat, there's your receipt for thirty-nine pounds, and I'm\r\nglad to see ten-pound notes going about the country in these hard\r\ntimes!\"\r\n\r\nBy mistake the \"distressful\" orator had put one ten-pound note into his\r\nparcel! He took his receipt, and went off without a word. But the\r\ncombination to get an \"abatement\" broke down then and there, and the\r\nother tenants came forward and put down their money.\r\n\r\nThese incidents occurred to Mr. Tener himself. Not less amusing and\r\ninstructive was a similar mistake on a larger scale made by an\r\nover-crafty tenant in dealing with one of Mr. Tener's friends a few\r\nyears ago in the county of Leitrim. This tenant, whom we will call\r\nDenis, was the fugleman also of a combination. He was a cattle dealer as\r\nwell as a farmer, and having spent a couple of hours in idly eloquent\r\nattempts to bring about a general abatement of the rents, he lost his\r\npatience.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, well, your honour!\" he said, \"I can't stay here all day talking\r\nlike these men, I must go to the fair at Boyle. Will you take a\r\ndeposit-receipt of the bank for ten pounds and give me the pound change?\r\nthat'll just be the nine pounds for the half-year's rent. But all the\r\nsame, yer honour, those men are all farmers, and it's not out of the\r\nfarm at all I made the ten pounds, it's out of the dealing!\"\r\n\r\n\"But you couldn't deal without a farm, Denis, for the stock,\" said the\r\nagent, as he glanced at the receipt. He hastily turned it over, and went\r\non, \"Just indorse the receipt, and I'll consider your proposition.\"\r\n\r\nThe receipt was indorsed, and at once taken off by the agent's clerk to\r\nthe bank to bring back pound-notes for it, while the agent quietly\r\nproceeded to fill out the regular form of receipt for a full year's\r\nrent, eighteen pounds. Denis noted what he supposed of course to be the\r\nagent's blunder, but like an astute person held his peace. The clerk\r\ncame back with the notes. Denis took up his receipt, and the agent\r\nquietly began handing him note after note across the table.\r\n\r\n\"But, your honour!\" exclaimed Denis, \"what on earth are ye giving me all\r\nthis money for?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's your change,\" said the agent, quite imperturbably. \"You gave me a\r\nbank receipt for one hundred pounds. I have given you a receipt for your\r\nfull year's rent, and here are eighty-two pounds in notes, and with it\r\neighteen shillings in silver--that's five per cent. reduction. I would\r\nhave made it ten per cent., only you were so very sharp, first about not\r\nhaving the money, and then about the full receipt!\"\r\n\r\nIn an instant all eyes were fastened upon Denis. Ichabod! the glory had\r\ndeparted. The chorus went up from his disenchanted followers:--\r\n\r\n\"Ah, glory be to God, you were not bright enough for the agent, Denis!\"\r\n\r\nAnd so that day the agent made a very full and handsome collection--and\r\nthere was a slight reduction in the deposit-accounts of the local bank!\r\n\r\nIn the evening Mr. Tener gave me the details of some cases of direct\r\nintimidation with the names of the tenants concerned. One man, whose\r\nfarm he visited, told him he had paid his rent not long before to the\r\nprevious agent. \"Well,\" said Mr. Tener, \"show me your receipt!\" On this\r\nthe tenant said that he dare not keep the receipt about him, nor even in\r\nthe house, lest it should be demanded by the emissaries of the League,\r\nwho went round to keep the tenants up to the \"Plan of Campaign,\" and\r\nthat it was hidden in his stable. And he went out to the stable and\r\nbrought it in.\r\n\r\nThis, he had reason to believe, was not an uncommon case.[12] The same\r\nman, wishing to take a grass farm which the people hoped the agent would\r\nconsent to have \"cut up\" was asked to give two names on a\r\npromissory-note to pay the rent. He demurred to this, and after a parley\r\nsaid, \"Would a certificate do?\" upon which he pulled out an old\r\ntobacco-box, and carefully unfolded from it a bank certificate of\r\ndeposit for a hundred pounds sterling! This tenant held eleven Irish, or\r\nmore than seventeen English, acres, and his yearly rent was £11, 16s.\r\n6d.\r\n\r\nThe people before this agitation began were generally quiet, thrifty,\r\nand industrious. They were great sheep-raisers. An old law of the Irish\r\nParliament had exempted sheep, but not cattle or crops, from distraint,\r\nwith an eye to encouraging the woollen interest in Ireland.\r\n\r\nAs to the sale of tenant-right in Ireland, he told me a curious story.\r\nOne woman, a widow, whom he named, owed two year' rent on a holding in\r\nUlster at £4 a year. She was abundantly able to pay, but for her own\r\nreasons preferred to be evicted, and, finally, by an understanding with\r\nhim, offered her tenant-right for sale. A man who had made money in\r\niron-mines in the County of Durham was a bidder, and finally offered\r\n£240 for the holding. It was knocked down to him. He then saw the agent,\r\nwho told him he had paid too much. The woman was then appealed to, and\r\nshe admitted that the agent was right. But it was shown that others had\r\noffered £200, and the woman finally agreed to take, and received, that\r\namount in gold, being fifty years' purchase!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUBLIN, _Thursday, March 1._--This has been a crowded day. I left\r\nPortumna very early on a car with Mr. Tener, intending to visit the\r\nscene of his latest collision with the \"National\" government of Ireland,\r\non my way to Loughrea. It was a bright spring morning, more like April\r\nin Italy than like March in America, and the country is full of natural\r\nbeauty. We made our first halt at the derelict house of Martin Kenny,\r\none of the \"victims\" of the famous \"Woodford evictions,\" so called, as I\r\nhave said, because Woodford is the nearest town.[13] The eviction here\r\ntook place October 21st, 1887. The house has been dismantled by the\r\nneighbours since that time, each man carrying off a door, or a shutter,\r\nor whatever best suited him. One of the constables who followed us as\r\nMr. Tener's body-guard had been present at the eviction. He came into\r\nthe house with us, and very graphically described the performance. The\r\nhouse was still full of heavy stones taken into it, partly to block the\r\nentrances, and partly as ammunition; and trunks of trees used as\r\n_chevaux defrise_ still protruded through the door and the window. These\r\ntrees had been cut down by the garrison in the woodlands here and there\r\nall over the property. I asked if the law in Ireland punished\r\ndepredations of this sort, and was informed that trees planted by\r\ntenants, if registered by them within a certain time, are the property\r\nof the tenants. This would astonish our landlords in America, where the\r\ntenant who sticks so much as a sunflower into his garden-patch makes a\r\npresent of it to his landlord.[14]\r\n\r\nI asked if the place made a long defence. Mr. Tener and the constable\r\nboth laughed, and the former told me that when the storming party\r\narrived shortly after daybreak, they found the house garrisoned only by\r\nsome small boys, who had been left there to keep watch. The men were\r\nfast asleep at some other place. The small boys ran away as fast as\r\npossible to give the alarm, but the police went in, and in a jiffey\r\npulled to pieces the elaborate defences prepared to repel them. Father\r\nCoen, the constable said, got to Kenny's house an hour after it was all\r\nover, with a mob of people howling and groaning. But the work had been\r\ndone, and other work also at the Castle of Cloondadauv, to which we next\r\ndrove.\r\n\r\nThis place takes its truly awe-inspiring name from a ruined Norman tower\r\nstanding on a picturesque promontory of no great height, which juts out\r\ninto the lovely lake here made by the Shannon. At no great expense this\r\ntower might be so restored as to make an ideal fishing-box. It now\r\nsimply adorns the holding formerly occupied by Mr. John Stanislaus\r\nBurke, a former tenant of Lord Clanricarde. The story of its capture on\r\nthe 17th of September is worth telling.\r\n\r\nSome days before the evictions were to come off, a meeting was held at\r\nWoodford or Loughrea, at which one of the speakers, the patriotic Dr.\r\nTully, rather incautiously and exultingly told his hearers that the\r\ndefence in 1886 of the tenant's house known as \"Fort Saunders\" had been\r\na grand and gallant affair indeed, but that next time \"the exterminators\r\nwould have to storm a castle\"!\r\n\r\nThis put Mr. Tener at once on the alert, and as Mr. Burke of Cloondadauv\r\nwas set down for eviction, it didn't require much cogitation to fix upon\r\nthe fortress destined to be \"stormed.\" So he set about the campaign. The\r\nCounty Inspector of the constabulary, who had made a secret\r\nreconnaissance, reported that he found the place too strong to be taken\r\nif defended, except \"by artillery.\" So it was determined to take it by\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\nWhen the previous evictions were made, the agent and the public forces\r\nhad marched from Portumna by the highway to Woodford, so that, of\r\ncourse, their advent was announced by the scouts and sentinels of the\r\nLeague from hill to hill long before they reached the scene of action,\r\nand abundant time was given to the agitators for organising a\r\n\"reception.\" Mr. Tener profited by the experience of his predecessors.\r\nHe contrived to get his force of constabulary through the town of\r\nPortumna without attracting any popular attention. And as early rising\r\nis not a popular virtue here, he resolved to steal a march on the\r\ndefenders of Cloondadauv.\r\n\r\nHe had brought up certain large boats to Portumna, and put them on the\r\nlake. Rousing his men before dawn, he soon had them all embarked, and on\r\ntheir way swiftly and silently by the river and the lake to Cloondadauv.\r\nThey reached the promontory by daybreak, and as soon as the hour of\r\nlegal action had arrived they were landed, and surrounded the \"castle.\"\r\nThe ancient portal was found to be blocked with heavy stones and trunks\r\nof trees, nor did any adit appear to be available, till a young\r\ngentleman who had accompanied the party as a volunteer, discovered in\r\none wall of the tower, at some little height from the ground, the vent\r\nof one of those conduits not infrequently found running down through the\r\nwalls of old castles, which were used sometimes as waste-ways for\r\nrubbish from above, and sometimes to receive water-pipes from below.\r\nLooking up into this vent, he saw a rope hanging free within it. Upon\r\nthis he hauled resolutely, and finding it firmly attached above, came to\r\nthe conclusion that it must have been fixed there by the garrison as a\r\nmeans of access to the interior.\r\n\r\nLike an adventurous young tar, he bade his comrades stand by, and nimbly\r\n\"swarmed\" up the rope, without thought or care of what might await him\r\nat the top. In a few moments his shouts from above proclaimed the\r\ncapture of the stronghold. It was absolutely deserted; the garrison,\r\nconfident that no attack would that day be made, had gone off to the\r\nnearest village. The interior of the castle was found filled with\r\nmunitions of war, in the shape of huge beams and piles of stones\r\nlaboriously carried up the winding stairs, and heaped on all the\r\nlanding-places in readiness for use. On the flat roof of the castle was\r\nestablished a sort of furnace for heating water or oil, to be poured\r\ndown upon the besiegers; and crowbars lay there in readiness to loosen\r\nout and dislodge the battlements, and topple them over upon the\r\nassailants.\r\n\r\nThe officers soon made their way all over the building, and thence\r\nproceeded to the residence of Mr. Burke near by, a large and very\r\ncommodious house. All the formalities were gone through with, a\r\ndetachment of policemen was put in charge, and the rest of the forces\r\nset out on their return to Portumna, before the organised \"defenders\" of\r\nCloondadauv, hastily called out of their comfortable beds or from their\r\nbreakfast-tables had realised the situation, and got the populace into\r\nmotion. A mass meeting was held in the neighbourhood, and many speeches\r\nwere made. But the castle and the farm-house and the holding all remain\r\nin the hands of a cool, quiet, determined-looking young Ulsterman, who\r\ntells me that he is getting on very well, and feels quite able with his\r\npolice-guard to protect himself. \"Once in a while,\" he said, \"they come\r\nhere from Loughrea with English Parliament-men, and stand outside of the\r\ngate, and call me 'Clanricarde's dog,' and make like speeches at me; but\r\nI don't mind them, and they see it, and go away again.\"\r\n\r\nOf Mr. Burke, the evicted tenant here, Mr. Crawford, the Protestant\r\nclergyman at Portumna, told me that he was abundantly able to pay his\r\nrent. The whole debt for which Burke was evicted was £115; and Mr.\r\nCrawford said he had himself offered Burke £300 for the holding. Burke\r\nwould have gladly taken this, but \"the League wouldn't let him.\" When\r\nhis right was put up for sale at Galway for £5, he did not dare to buy\r\nit in, and he is now living with his wife and children on the League\r\nfunds. Lord Clanricarde's agent offered to take him back and restore his\r\nright if he would pay what he owed; but he dared not accept. This farm\r\ncomprises over one hundred and ten English acres, which Burke held at a\r\nrent--fixed by the Land Court--of £77, the valuation for taxes being\r\n£83.\r\n\r\nTo call the eviction of such a tenant in such circumstances from such a\r\nholding a \"sentence of death,\" is making ducks and drakes of the English\r\nlanguage. Mr. Crawford's opinion, founded upon a thorough personal\r\nknowledge of the region, is that there is no exceptional distress in\r\nthis part of Ireland, and that over-renting has nothing to do with such\r\ndistress as does exist here. The case of a man named Egan, one of the\r\n\"victims\" of the Woodford evictions of 1886, certainly bears out this\r\nview of the matter. Egan, who was a tenant, not at all of Lord\r\nClanricarde, but of a certain Mrs. Lewis, had occupied for twenty years\r\na holding of about sixteen Irish acres, or more than twenty English\r\nacres. This he held at a yearly rental of £8, 15s., being 9d. over the\r\nvaluation.\r\n\r\nIn August 1886 he was evicted for refusing to pay one year's rent then\r\ndue. At that time the crops standing on the land were valued by him at\r\n£60, 13s. He also owned six beasts. In other words, this man, when he\r\nwas called upon to pay a debt of £8, 15s. had in his own possession,\r\nbeside the valuable tenant-right of his holding, more than a hundred\r\npounds sterling of merchantable assets. He refused to pay, and he was\r\nevicted.\r\n\r\nThis was in August 1886. But such are the ideas now current in Ireland\r\nas to the relations of landlord and tenant, that immediately after his\r\neviction Egan sent his daughter to gather some cabbages off the farm as\r\nif nothing had happened. The Emergency men in charge actually objected,\r\nand sent the damsel away. Thereupon Egan, on the 6th of September,\r\nserved a legal notice on Mrs. Lewis, his landlady, requiring her either\r\nto let him take all the crops on the farm, or to pay him their value,\r\nestimated by him, as I have said, at £60, 13s. Two days after this, on\r\nthe 8th of September, more than a hundred men came to the place by night\r\nand removed the greater portion of the crops. Not wishing a return of\r\nthese visitors, Mrs. Lewis, on the 16th of September, sent word to Egan\r\nto come and take away what was left of the crops; one of the horses\r\nemployed in the nocturnal harvest of September 8th having been seized by\r\nthe police and identified as belonging to Egan. Egan did not respond;\r\nbut in July 1887 he brought an action against his landlady to recover\r\n£100 sterling for her \"detention of his goods,\" and her \"conversion of\r\nthe same to her own use \"!\r\n\r\nThe case was heard by the Recorder at Kilmainham, and the facts which I\r\nhave briefly recited were established by the evidence. The daughter of\r\nthis extraordinary \"victim\" Egan appeared as a witness, so \"fashionably\r\ndressed\" as to attract a remark on the subject from the defendant's\r\ncounsel. To this she replied that \"her brothers in America sent her\r\nmoney.\"\r\n\r\n\"If your brothers in America sent you money for such purposes,\" not\r\nunnaturally observed the Recorder, \"why did they allow your father to\r\nsacrifice crops worth £60 for the non-payment of £8, 15s.?\"\r\n\r\n\"They were tired of that,\" said the young lady airily; \"the land wasn't\r\nworth the rent!\"\r\n\r\nThat is to say, a farm which yielded a crop of £60, and pastured several\r\nhead of cattle, was not worth £8, 15s. a year. Certainly it was not\r\nworth £8, 15s. a year if the tenant under the operation of the existing\r\nor the impending laws of Great Britain in Ireland could get, or hope to\r\nget it for the half of that rent, or for no rent at all.\r\n\r\nBut this being thus, on what grounds are the rest of mankind invited to\r\nregard this excellent man as a \"victim\" worthy of sympathy and of\r\nmaterial aid? How had he come to be in arrears of a year in August 1886?\r\nThe proceedings at Kilmainham tell us this.\r\n\r\nIn November 1885 he had demanded, with other tenants of Mrs. Lewis, a\r\nreduction of 50 per cent. This would have given him his holding at a\r\nrental of £4, 7s. 6d. Mrs. Lewis refused the concession, and a month\r\nafterwards an attempt was made to blow up her son's house with dynamite.\r\nBetween that time and August 1886, all the efforts of her son, who was\r\nalso her agent, to collect her dues by seizing beasts, were defeated by\r\nthe driving away of the cattle, so that no remedy but an eviction was\r\nleft to her. I take it for granted that Mrs. Lewis had a family to\r\nmaintain, and debts of one sort and another to pay, as well as Mr.\r\nEgan--but I observe this material difference between her position and\r\nhis during the whole of this period of \"strained relations\" between\r\nherself and her tenant, that whereas she lay completely out of the\r\nenjoyment of the rent due her, being the interest on her capital,\r\nrepresented in her title to the land, Mr. Egan remained in the complete\r\nenjoyment and use of the land. Clearly the tenant was in a better\r\nposition than the landlord, and as we are dealing not with the history\r\nof Ireland in the past, but with the condition of Ireland at present, it\r\nappears to me to be quite beside the purpose to ask my sympathies for\r\nMr. Egan on the ground that a century or half a century ago the\r\nancestors of Mr. Egan may have been at the mercy of the ancestors of\r\nMrs. Lewis. However that may have been, Mr. Egan seems to me now to have\r\nhad legally much the advantage of Mrs. Lewis. Not only this. Both\r\nlegally and materially Mr. Egan, the tenant-farmer at Woodford, seems to\r\nme to have had much the advantage of thousands of his countrymen living\r\nand earning their livelihood by their daily labour in such a typical\r\nAmerican commonwealth, for example, as Massachusetts. I have here with\r\nme the Seventh Annual Report of the Bureau of Statistics of\r\nMassachusetts. From this I learn that in 1876 the average yearly wages\r\nearned by workmen in Massachusetts were $482.72, or in round numbers\r\nsomething over £96. Out of this amount the Massachusetts workman had to\r\nfeed, clothe, and house himself, and those dependent on him.\r\n\r\nHis outlay for rent alone was on the average $109.07, or in round\r\nnumbers rather less than £22, making 22-1/2 per cent, of his earnings.\r\n\r\nHow was it with Mr. Egan? Out of his labour on his holding he got\r\nmerchantable crops worth £60 sterling, or in round numbers $300, besides\r\nproducing in the shape of vegetables and dairy stuff, pigs and poultry,\r\ncertainly a very large proportion of the food necessary for his\r\nhousehold, and raising and fattening beasts, worth at a low estimate £20\r\nor $100 more. And while thus engaged, his outlay for rent, which\r\nincluded not only the house in which he lived, but the land out of which\r\nhe got the returns of his labour expended upon it, was £8, 15s., or\r\nconsiderably less than one-half the outlay of the Massachusetts workman\r\nupon the rent of nothing more than a roof to shelter himself and his\r\nfamily. Furthermore, the money thus paid out by the Massachusetts\r\nworkman for rent was simply a tribute paid for accommodation had and\r\nenjoyed, while out of every pound sterling paid as rent by the Irish\r\ntenant there reverted to his credit, so long as he continued to fulfil\r\nhis legal obligations, a certain proportion, calculable, valuable, and\r\nsaleable, in the form of his tenant-right.\r\n\r\nI am not surprised to learn that the Recorder dismissed the suit brought\r\nby Mr. Egan, and gave costs against him. But the mere fact that in such\r\ncircumstances it was possible for Egan to bring such a suit, and get a\r\nhearing for it, makes it quite clear that Americans of a sympathetic\r\nturn of mind can very easily find much more meritorious objects of\r\nsympathy than the Irish tenant-farmers of Galway without crossing the\r\nAtlantic in quest of them.\r\n\r\nFrom Cloondadauv to Loughrea we had a long but very interesting drive,\r\npassing on the way, and at no great distance from each other, Father\r\nCoen's neat, prosperous-looking presbytery of Ballinakill, and the shop\r\nand house of a local boat-builder named Tully, who is pleasantly known\r\nin the neighbourhood as \"Dr. Tully,\" by reason of his recommendation of\r\na very particular sort of \"pills for landlords.\" The presbytery is now\r\noccupied by Father Coen, who finds it becoming his position as the moral\r\nteacher and guide of his people to be in arrears of two and a half years\r\nwith the rent of his holding, and who is said to have entertained Mr.\r\nBlunt and other sympathising statesmen very handsomely on their visit to\r\nLoughrea and Woodford,[15] \"Dr.\" Tully being one of the guests invited\r\nto meet them.[16] Not far from this presbytery, Mr. Tener showed me the\r\nscene of one of the most cowardly murders which have disgraced this\r\nregion. Of Loughrea, the objective of our drive this morning, Sir George\r\nTrevelyan, I am told, during his brief rule in Ireland, found it\r\nnecessary to say that murder had there become an institution. Woodford,\r\npreviously a dull and law-abiding spot, was illuminated by a lurid light\r\nof modern progress about three years ago, upon the transfer thither in\r\nthe summer of 1885 of a priest from Loughrea, familiarly known as \"the\r\nfirebrand priest.\"\r\n\r\nIn November of that year, as I have already related, Mr. Egan and other\r\ntenants of Mrs. Lewis of Woodford made their demand for a 50 per cent.\r\nreduction of their rents, upon the refusal of which an attempt was made\r\nwith dynamite on the 18th December to blow up the house of Mrs. Lewis's\r\nson and agent. All the bailiffs in the region round about were warned to\r\ngive up serving processes, and many of them were cowed into doing so.\r\nOne man, however, was not cowed. This was a gallant Irish soldier,\r\ndischarged with honour after the Crimean war, and known in the country\r\nas \"Balaklava,\" because he was one of the \"noble six hundred,\" who there\r\nrode \"into the jaws of death, into the valley of hell.\" His name was\r\nFinlay, and he was a Catholic. At a meeting in Woodford, Father Coen\r\n(the priest now in arrears), it is said, looked significantly at Finlay,\r\nand said, \"no process-server will be got to serve processes for Sir\r\nHenry Burke of Marble Hill.\" The words and the look were thrown away on\r\nthe veteran who had faced the roar and the crash of the Russian guns,\r\nand later on, in December 1885, Finlay did his duty, and served the\r\nprocesses given to him. From that moment he and his wife were\r\n\"boycotted.\" His own kinsfolk dared not speak to him. His house was\r\nattacked by night. He was a doomed man. On the 3d March 1886, about 2\r\no'clock P.M., he left his house--which Mr. Tener pointed out to me--to\r\ncut fuel in a wood belonging to Sir Henry Burke, at no great distance.\r\nTwice he made the journey between his house and the wood. The third time\r\nhe went and returned no more. His wife growing uneasy at his prolonged\r\nabsence went out to look for him. She found his body riddled with\r\nbullets lying lifeless in the highway. The police who went into Woodford\r\nwith the tale report the people as laughing and jeering at the agony of\r\nthe widowed woman. She was with them, and, maddened by the savage\r\nconduct of these wretched creatures, she knelt down over-against the\r\nhouse of Father Egan, and called down the curse of God upon him.\r\n\r\nOn the next day things were worse. No one could be found to supply a\r\ncoffin for the murdered man.[17] When the police called upon the priests\r\nto exert their influence and enforce some semblance at least of\r\nChristian and Catholic decency upon the people confided to their charge,\r\nthe priests not only refused to do their duty, but floutingly referred\r\nthe police to Lady Mary Burke. \"He did her work,\" they said, \"let her\r\nsend a hearse now to bury him.\" The lady thus insolently spoken of is\r\none of the best of the Catholic women of Ireland. At her summons Father\r\nBurke, a few years only before his death, I remember, made a long winter\r\njourney, though in very bad health, from Dublin to Marble Hill to soothe\r\nthe last hours and attend the death-bed of her husband.\r\n\r\nNo one who knew and loved him can wish him to have lived to hear from\r\nher lips such a tale of the degradation of Catholic priests in his own\r\nland of Galway.\r\n\r\nMr. Tener pointed out to me, at another place on the road, near\r\nBallinagar, the deserted burying-ground in which, after much trouble, a\r\ngrave was found for the brave old soldier who had escaped the Russian\r\ncannon-balls to be so foully done to death by felons of his own race.\r\nThere the last rites were performed by Father Callaghy, a priest who was\r\nhimself \"boycotted\" for resigning the presidency of the League in his\r\nparish, and for the still graver offence of paying his rent. For weeks\r\nit was necessary to guard the grave![18]\r\n\r\nFrom that day to this no one has been brought to justice for this crime,\r\ncommitted in broad daylight, and within sight of the highway. Mr. Place,\r\nwhom I saw at Portumna, told me that he believed the police had no moral\r\ndoubt as to the murderer of Finlay, but that it was useless to think of\r\ngetting legal evidence to convict him.\r\n\r\nMr. Tener tells me that when Mr. Wilfrid Blunt came to Woodford he went\r\nwith Father Egan, and accompanied by the police, to see the widow of\r\nthis murdered man, heard from her own lips the sickening story, and took\r\nnotes of it. But when Mr. Rowlands, M.P., an English \"friend of Home\r\nRule,\" was examined the other day during the trial of Mr. Blunt, he was\r\nobliged to confess that though he had visited Woodford more than once,\r\nand conversed freely with Mr. Blunt about it, he had \"never heard of the\r\nmurder of Finlay.\"\r\n\r\nSuch an incident is apparently of little interest to politicians at\r\nWestminster. Fortunately for Ireland, it is of a nature to command more\r\nattention at the Vatican.\r\n\r\nNature has sketched the scenery of this part of Ireland with a free,\r\nbold hand. It is not so grand or so wild as the scenery of Western\r\nDonegal, but it has both a wildness and a grandeur of its own. Sir Henry\r\nBurke's seat of Marble Hill, as seen in the distance from the road,\r\nstands superbly, high up on a lofty range of wooded hills, from which it\r\ncommands the country for miles. And no town I have seen in Ireland is\r\nmore picturesquely placed than Loughrea. It has an almost Italian aspect\r\nas you approach it from Woodford. But no lake in Lombardy or Piedmont is\r\nso peculiarly and exquisitely tinted as the lough on which it stands.\r\nThe delicate grey-green of the sparkling waters reminded me of the\r\nsingular and well-defined belts and stretches of chrysoprase upon which\r\nyou sometimes come in sailing through the dark azure of the Southern\r\nSeas. I have never before seen precisely such a hue in any body of fresh\r\nwater. The lake is incorrectly described, Mr. Tener tells me, in the\r\nguide-books, as being one of the many curious developments of the Lower\r\nShannon. It is fed by springs, but if, like the river-lakes, it was\r\nformed by a solution of the limestone, this fact may have some chemical\r\nrelation with its very peculiar colour. It contains three picturesque\r\nislands. No stream flows into it, but two streams issue from it. The\r\ntown of Loughrea is an ancient holding of the De Burghs, and the\r\nestate-office of Lord Clanricarde is here in one wing of a great\r\nbarrack, standing, as I understood Mr. Tener to say, on the site of a\r\nformer fortress of the family. Lord Clanricarde's property here is put\r\ndown by Mr. Hussey de Burgh at 49,025 acres in County Galway, valued at\r\n£19,634, and at 3576 acres in the county of the City of Galway, valued\r\nat £1202. These, I believe, are statute acres, and in estimating the\r\nrelation of Irish rentals to Irish land this fact must be always\r\nascertained. Of the so-called \"Woodford\" property the present rental is\r\nno more than £1900, payable by 260 tenants. The Poor-Law valuation for\r\ntaxes is £2400. There was a revision of the whole Galway property made\r\nby the father of the present Marquis. Of the 260 Woodford holdings only\r\ntwelve were increased, in no case more than 6-1/4 per cent, over the\r\nvaluation. In 1882 six of these twelve tenants applied to the Land\r\nCourt. The rents were in no case restored to the figures before 1872,\r\nbut about 7 per cent. was taken off the increased rental. The assertion\r\nrepeatedly made that in 1882 rents were reduced by the Land Court 50 per\r\ncent. on the Clanricarde estates, Mr. Tener tells me, is absolutely\r\nfalse. In the first year of the Court no reduction went beyond 10 per\r\ncent., and in later years, even under the panic of low prices, the\r\naverage has not exceeded 20 per cent.\r\n\r\nAfter making arrangements for a car to take me on to Woodlawn, where I\r\nwas to catch the Dublin train, I went out with Mr. Tener to look at the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nMy drive from Loughrea to Woodlawn was delightful. It took me over a\r\nlong stretch of the best hunting country of Galway, and my jarvey was a\r\nGalwegian of the type dear to the heart of Lever. He was a \"Nationalist\"\r\nafter his fashion, but he did not hesitate to come rattling up through\r\nthe town to the Estate Office to take me up; and after we got fairly off\r\nupon the highway, he spoke with more freedom than respect of all sorts\r\nand conditions of men in and about Loughrea.\r\n\r\n\"He's a sharp little man, that Mr. Tener,\" he said, \"and he gave the\r\nboys a most beautiful beating at Burke's place.\"\r\n\r\nThis was said with genuine gusto, and not at all in the querulous spirit\r\nof the delightful member of Parliament who complained at Westminster\r\nwith unconscious humour that the agent and the police in that case had\r\n\"dishonourably\" stolen a march on the defenders of Cloondadauv!\r\n\r\n\"But we've beaten them entirely,\" he said, with equal zest, \"at Marble\r\nHill. Sir Henry has agreed to pay all the costs, and the living expenses\r\ntoo, of the poor men that were put out.[19] I didn't ever think we'd get\r\nthat; but ye see the truth is,\" he added confidentially, \"he must have\r\nthe money, Sir Henry--he's lying out of a deal, and then there's heavy\r\ncharges on the property. A fine property it is indeed!\"\r\n\r\n\"In fact,\" I said, \"you put Sir Henry to the wall. Is that it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's like that. But we shan't get that out of Clanricarde, I'm\r\nthinking. He's got a power o' money they tell me; and he's that of the\r\nould Burke blood, he won't mind fighting just as long as you like!\"\r\n\r\nAs we drove along, he pointed out to me several fine stretches of\r\nhunting country, and, to my surprise, informed me that only the other\r\nday \"there was as fine a meet as ever you saw, more than a hundred\r\nladies and gentlemen--a grand sight it was.\"\r\n\r\nI asked if the hunting had not been \"put down by the League.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, now then, sir, who'd be wanting to put down the hunting here in\r\nGalway?--and Ballinasloe? Were you ever at Ballinasloe? just the\r\ngrandest horse fair there is in the whole wide world!\"\r\n\r\nI insisted that I had always heard a great deal about the opposition of\r\nthe League to hunting.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that'll be some little lawyer fellow,\" he replied, \"like that\r\nHealy, that can't sit on a horse! It's the grandest country in all the\r\nworld for riding over. What for wouldn't they ride over it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Were there many went out to America from about Loughrea?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes; they were always coming and going. But as many came back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, they didn't like the country. It wasn't as good a country, was it,\r\nas old Ireland? And they had to work too hard; and then some of them got\r\nmoney, and they'd like to spend it in the old place.\"\r\n\r\nThe country about Woodlawn is very picturesque and well wooded, and for\r\na long distance we followed the neatly-kept stone walls of the large and\r\nhandsome park of Lord Ashtown.\r\n\r\n\"The most beautiful and biggest trees in all Ireland, sorr,\" said the\r\njarvey, \"and it's a great pity, it is, ye can't stay to let me drive you\r\nall over it, for the finest part of the park is just what you can't see\r\nfrom this road. Oh, her ladyship would never object to any gentleman\r\ndriving about to see the beauties of the place. She is a very good\r\nwoman, is her ladyship. She gave work the last Christmas to thirty-two\r\nmen, and there wasn't another house in the country there that had work\r\nfor more than ten or twelve. A very good woman she is, indeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that is a very handsome church, it is indeed. It is the Protestant\r\nChurch. Lord Ashtown built it; he was a very good man too, and did a\r\npower of good--building and making roads, and giving work to the people.\r\nHe was buried there in that Castle, over the station--Trench's Castle,\r\nthey called it.\"\r\n\r\n\"All that lumber there by the station?\"\r\n\r\n\"That came out of the Ashtown woods. They were always cutting down the\r\ntrees; there was so many of them you might be cutting for years--you\r\nwould never get to the end of them.\"\r\n\r\nWoodlawn Station is one of the neatest and prettiest railway stations I\r\nhave seen in Ireland--more like a picturesque stone cottage, green and\r\ngay with flowers, than like a station. The station-master's family of\r\ncheery well-dressed lads and lasses went and came about the bright fire\r\nin the waiting-room in a friendly unobtrusive fashion, chatting with the\r\npoliceman and the porter and the passengers. It was hard to believe\r\none's-self within an easy drive of the \"cockpit of Ireland.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nBORRIS, _Friday, March 2d._--This is the land of the Kavanaghs, and a\r\nlovely, picturesque, richly-wooded land it is. I left Dublin with Mr.\r\nGyles by an afternoon train; the weather almost like June. We ran from\r\nthe County of Dublin into Kildare, and from Kildare into Carlow, through\r\nhills; rural scenery quite unlike anything I have hitherto seen in\r\nIreland. At Bagnalstown, a very pretty place, with a spire which takes\r\nthe eye, our host joined us, and came on with us to this still more\r\nattractive spot. Borris has been the seat of his family for many\r\ncenturies. The MacMorroghs of Leinster, whom the Kavanaghs lineally\r\nrepresent, dwelt here long before Dermot MacMorrogh, finding his\r\nelective throne in Leinster too hot to hold him, went off into\r\nAquitaine, to get that famous \"letter of marque\" from Henry II. of\r\nEngland, with the help of which this king without a kingdom induced\r\nRichard de Clare, an earl without an earldom, to lend him a hand and\r\nbring the Normans into Ireland. Many of this race lie buried in the\r\nruins of St. Mullen's Abbey, on the Barrow, in this county. But none of\r\nthem, I opine, ever did such credit to the name as its present\r\nrepresentative, Arthur MacMorrogh Kavanagh.\r\n\r\nI had some correspondence with Mr. Kavanagh several years ago, when he\r\nsent me, through my correspondent for publication in New York, a very\r\nstriking statement of his views on the then condition of Irish\r\naffairs--views since abundantly vindicated; and like most people who\r\nhave paid any attention to the recent history of Ireland, I knew how\r\nwonderful an illustration his whole career has been of what philosophers\r\ncall the superiority of man to his accidents, and plain people the power\r\nof the will. But I knew this only imperfectly. His servant brought him\r\nup to the carriage and placed him in it. This it was impossible not to\r\nsee. But I had not talked with him for five minutes before it quite\r\npassed out of my mind. Never was there such a justification of the\r\nparadoxical title which Wilkinson gave to his once famous book, _The\r\nHuman Body, and its Connexion with Man_,--never such a living refutation\r\nof the theory that it is the thumb which differentiates man from the\r\nlower animals. Twenty times this evening I have been reminded of the\r\nretort I heard made the other day at Cork by a lawyer, who knows Mr.\r\nKavanagh well, to a priest of \"Nationalist\" proclivities, who knows him\r\nnot at all. Some allusion having been made to Borris, the lawyer said to\r\nme, \"You will see at Borris the best and ablest Irishman alive.\" On this\r\nthe priest testily and tartly broke in, \"Do you mean the man without\r\nhands or feet?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean,\" replied the lawyer, very quietly, \"the man in whom all that\r\nhas gone in you or me to arms and legs has gone to heart and head!\"\r\n\r\nBorris House stands high in the heart of an extensive and nobly wooded\r\npark, and commands one of the finest landscapes I have seen in Ireland.\r\nAs we stood and gazed upon it from the hall door, the distant hills were\r\ntouched with a soft purple light such as transfigures the Apennines at\r\nsunset.\r\n\r\n\"You should see this view in June,\" said Mrs, Kavanagh, \"we are all\r\nbrown and bare now.\"\r\n\r\nBrown and bare, like most other terms, are relative. To the eye of an\r\nAmerican this whole region now seems a sea of verdure, less clear and\r\nfresh, I can easily suppose, than it may be in the early summer, but\r\nverdure still. And one must get into the Adirondacks, or up among the\r\nmountains of Western Virginia, to find on our Atlantic slope such trees\r\nas I have this evening seen. One grand ilex near the house could hardly\r\nbe matched in the Villa d'Este.\r\n\r\nThe house is stately and commodious, and more ancient than it appears to\r\nbe,--so many additions have been made to it at different times. It has\r\npassed through more than one siege, and in the '98 Mr. Kavanagh tells me\r\nthe townspeople of Borris came up here and sought refuge. There are vast\r\ncaverns under the house and grounds, doubtless made by taking out from\r\nthe hill the stone used in building this house, and the fortresses which\r\nstood here before it. In these all sorts of stores were kept, and many\r\nof the people found shelter.\r\n\r\nI need not say that there is a banshee at Borris--though no living\r\nwitness, I believe, has heard its warning wail. But as we sat in the\r\nbeautiful library, and watched the dying light of day, a lady present\r\ntold us a tale more gruesome than many of those in which the \"psychical\"\r\ninquirers delight. She was sitting, she said, in an upper room of an\r\nancient mansion here in Carlow, in which she lives, when, from the lawn\r\nbelow, there came up to her a low, sad, shrill cry--the croon of a\r\nwoman, such as one hears from the mourners sitting among the turbaned\r\ntombstones of the hill of Eyoub at Constantinople. It startled her, and\r\nshe held her breath and listened. She was alone, as she knew, in that\r\npart of the house, and the hall door below was unlocked, as is the\r\nfashion still in Ireland, despite all the troubles and turmoils. Again\r\nthe sound came, and this time nearer to the house. Could it be the\r\nbanshee? Again and again it rose and died away, each time nearer and\r\nnearer. Then, as she listened, all her nerves strung to the keenest\r\nsensibility, it came again, and now, beyond a doubt, within the hall\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nWith an effort she rose from her chair, opened a door leading into a\r\ncorridor running aside from the main stairway, and fled at full speed\r\ntowards the wing in which she knew that she would find some of the\r\nmaids. As she sped along she heard the cry again and again far behind\r\nher, as from a creature slowly and steadily mounting the grand stairway\r\ntowards the room which she had just quitted.\r\n\r\nShe found the maids, who fell into a terrible fright when she told her\r\nstory and dared not budge. So the bells were violently rung till the\r\nbutler and footman appeared. To the first she said simply, \"There is a\r\nmad woman in this house--go and find her!\"\r\n\r\n\"The man looked at me,\" she said, \"as I spoke with a curious expression\r\nin his face as of one who thought, 'yes, there is a mad woman in the\r\nhouse, and she is not far to seek!'\"\r\n\r\nBut the lady insisted, and the men finally went off on their quest. In\r\nthe course of half an hour it was rewarded. The mad woman--a dangerous\r\ncreature--who had wandered away from an asylum in the neighbourhood, was\r\nfound curled up and fast asleep in the lady's own bed!\r\n\r\nFancy a delicate woman going alone into her bedroom at midnight to be\r\nsuddenly confronted by an apparition of that sort!\r\n\r\n\r\nBORRIS, _March 3d._--After a stroll on the lawn this morning, the wide\r\nand glorious prospect bathed in the light of a really soft spring day, I\r\nhad a conversation with Mr. Kavanagh about the Land Corporation, of\r\nwhich he is the guiding spirit. This is a defensive organisation of the\r\nIrish landlords against the Land League. When a landlord has been driven\r\ninto evicting his tenants, the next step, in the \"war against\r\nlandlordism,\" is to prevent other tenants from taking the vacated lands\r\nand cultivating them. This is accomplished by \"boycotting\" any man who\r\ndoes this as a \"land-grabber.\"\r\n\r\nThe ultimate sanction of the \"boycott\" being \"murder,\" derelict farms\r\nincreased under this system very rapidly; and the Eleventh Commandment\r\nof the League, \"Thou shalt not pay the rent which thy neighbour hath\r\nrefused to pay,\" was in a fair way to dethrone the Ten Commandments of\r\nSinai throughout Ireland, even before the formal adoption in 1886 of the\r\n\"Plan of Campaign.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone would perhaps have hit the facts more accurately, if,\r\ninstead of calling an eviction in Ireland a \"sentence of death,\" he had\r\ncalled the taking of a tenancy a sentence of death. Mr. Hussey at Lixnaw\r\nhad two tenants, Edmond and James Fitzmaurice. Edmond Fitzmaurice was\r\n\"evicted\" in May 1887; but he was taken into the house of a neighbour,\r\nmade very comfortable, and still lives. James Fitzmaurice took, for the\r\nsake of the family, the land from which Edmond was evicted, and for this\r\nhe was denounced as a \"land-grabber,\" boycotted, and finally shot dead\r\nin the presence of his daughter.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting in Dublin in the autumn of 1885, a parish priest, the Rev.\r\nMr. Cantwell, described it as a \"cardinal virtue\" that \"no one should\r\ntake a farm from which another had been evicted,\" and called upon the\r\npeople who heard him to \"pass any such man by unnoticed, and treat him\r\nas an enemy in their midst.\" Public opinion and the law, if not the\r\nauthorities of his church would make short work of any priest who talked\r\nin this fashion in New York. But in Ireland, and under the British\r\nGovernment, it seems they order things differently. So it occurred one\r\nday to the landlords thus assailed, as it did to the sea-lions of the\r\nCape of Good Hope when the French sailors attacked them, that they might\r\ndefend themselves.\r\n\r\nTo this end the Land Corporation was instituted, with a considerable\r\ncapital at its back, and Mr. Kavanagh at its head. The \"plan of\r\ncampaign\" of this Corporation is to take over from the landlords\r\nderelict lands and cultivate them, stocking them where that is\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nIt is in this way that the derelict lands on the Ponsonby property at\r\nYoughal are now worked. But Mr. Kavanagh tells me that the men employed\r\nby the Corporation, of whom Father Keller spoke as a set of desperadoes\r\nor \"_enfants perdus_,\" are really a body of resolute and capable working\r\nmen farmers. Many, but by no means all of them, are Protestants and\r\nUlstermen; and that they are up to their work would seem to be shown by\r\nthe fact stated to me, that in no case so far have any of them been\r\ndeterred and driven off from the holdings confided to them. A great part\r\nof the Luggacurren property of Lord Lansdowne is now worked by the\r\nCorporation; and Mr. Kavanagh was kind enough to let me see the\r\naccounts, which indicate a good business result for the current year on\r\nthat property. This is all very interesting. But what a picture it\r\npresents of social demoralisation! And what is to be the end of it all?\r\nCan a country be called civilised in which a farmer with a family to\r\nmaintain, having the capital and the experience necessary to manage\r\nsuccessfully a small farm, is absolutely forbidden, on pain of social\r\nostracism, and eventually on pain of death, by a conspiracy of his\r\nneighbours, to take that farm of its lawful owner at what he considers\r\nto be a fair rent? And how long can any civilisation of our complex\r\nmodern type endure in a country in which such a state of things\r\ntolerated by the alleged Government of that country has to be met, and\r\nmore or less partially mitigated, by deviating to the cultivation of\r\nfarms rendered in this way derelict large amounts of capital which might\r\nbe, and ought to be, far more profitably employed in other ways?\r\n\r\nMr. Kavanagh, after serving the office of High Sheriff thirty years ago,\r\nfirst for Kilkenny, and then for Carlow, sat in Parliament for fourteen\r\nyears, from 1866 to 1880, as an Irish county member. He has a very large\r\nproperty here in Carlow, and property also in Wexford, and in Kilkenny,\r\nand was sworn into the Privy Council two years ago. If the personal\r\ninterests and the family traditions of any man alive can be said to be\r\nrooted in the Irish soil, this is certainly true of his interests and\r\nhis traditions. How can the peace and prosperity of Ireland be served by\r\na state of things which condemns an Irishman of such ties and such\r\ntraining to expend his energies and his ability in defending the\r\nelementary right of Paddy O'Rourke to take stock and work a ten-acre\r\nfarm on terms that suit himself and his landlord?\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon we took a delightful walk through the woods, Mr.\r\nKavanagh going with us on horseback. Every hill and clump of trees on\r\nthis large domain he knows, and he led us like a master of woodcraft\r\nthrough all manner of leafy byways to the finest points of view. The\r\nBarrow flows past Borris, making pictures at every turn, and the banks\r\non both sides are densely and beautifully wooded. We came in one place\r\nupon a sawmill at work in the forest, and Mr. Kavanagh showed us with\r\npride the piles of excellent timber which he turns out here. But he took\r\na greater pride in a group, sacred from the axe, of really magnificent\r\nScotch firs, such as I had certainly not expected to find in Ireland.\r\nNearer the mansion are some remarkable Irish yews. The gardens are of\r\nall sorts and very extensive, but we found the head-gardener bitterly\r\nlamenting the destruction by a fire in one of the conservatories of more\r\nthan six thousand plants just prepared for setting out.\r\n\r\nThere are many curious old books and papers here, and a student of early\r\nIrish history might find matter to keep him well employed for a long\r\ntime in this region. It was from this region and the race which ruled\r\nit, of which race Mr. Kavanagh is the actual representative, that the\r\ninitiative came of the first Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland. Strongbow\r\nmade what, from the Anglo-Norman point of view, was a perfectly\r\nlegitimate bargain, with a dispossessed prince to help him to the\r\nrecovery of his rights on the understanding that these rights, when\r\nrecovered, should pass in succession to himself through the only\r\ndaughter of the prince, whom he proposed to marry. It does not appear\r\nthat Strongbow knew, or that Dermot MacMorrogh cared to tell him, how\r\nutterly unlike the rights of an Anglo-Norman prince were those of the\r\nelective life-tenant of an Irish principality. FitzStephen, the son by\r\nher second marriage of Nesta, the Welsh royal mistress of Henry\r\nBeauclerk, and his cousin, Maurice Fitzgerald, the leaders into Ireland\r\nof the Geraldines, were no more clear in their minds about this than\r\nStrongbow, and it is to the original muddle thus created that Professor\r\nRichey doubtless rightly refers the worst and most troublesome\r\ncomplications of the land question in Ireland. The distinction between\r\nthe King's lieges and the \"mere Irish,\" for example, is unquestionably a\r\nlegal distinction, though it is continually and most mischievously used\r\nas if it were a proof of the race-hatred borne by the Normans and Saxons\r\nin Ireland from the first against the Celts. The O'Briens, the O'Neills,\r\nthe O'Mullaghlins, the O'Connors, and the M'Morroghs, \"the five bloods,\"\r\nas they are called, were certainly Celts, but whether in virtue of their\r\nbeing, or claiming to be, the royal races respectively of Minister, of\r\nUlster, of Meath, of Connaught, and of Leinster, or from whatever other\r\nreason, these races were \"within the king's law,\" and were never \"mere\r\nIrish\" from the first planting of the Anglo-Norman power in Ireland. The\r\ncase of a priest, Shan O'Kerry, \"an Irish enemy of the king,\" presented\r\n\"contrary to the form of statute\" to the vicarage of Lusk, in the reign\r\nof Edward IV. (1465), illustrates this. An Act of Parliament was passed\r\nto declare the aforesaid \"Shan O'Kerry,\" or \"John of Kevernon,\" to be\r\n\"English born, and of English nation,\" and that he might \"hold and enjoy\r\nthe said benefice.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a genealogy here of the M'Morroghs and Kavanaghs, most\r\ngorgeously and elaborately gotten up many years ago for Mr. Kavanagh's\r\ngrandfather, which shows how soon the Norman and the native strains of\r\nblood become commingled. When one remembers how much Norman blood must\r\nhave gone even into far-off Connaught when King John, in the early part\r\nof the thirteenth century, coolly gave away that realm of the O'Connors\r\nto the De Burgos, and how continually the English of the Pale fled from\r\nthe exactions inflicted upon them by their own people, and sought refuge\r\n\"among the savage and mere Irish,\" one cannot help thinking that the\"\r\nRace Question\" has been \"worked for at least all it is worth\" by\r\nphilosophers bent on unravelling the 'snarl' of Irish affairs. If this\r\ngenealogy may be trusted, there was little to choose between the ages\r\nwhich immediately preceded and the ages which followed the Anglo-Norman\r\ninvasion in the matter of respect for human life. Celtic chiefs and\r\nNorman knights \"died in their boots\" as regularly as frontiersmen in\r\nTexas. One personage is designated in the genealogy as \"the murderer,\"\r\nfor the truly Hibernian reason, so far as appears, that he was himself\r\nmurdered while quite a youth, and before he had had a chance to murder\r\nmore than three or four of his immediate relatives. It was as if the son\r\nof Geoffrey Plantagenet and the Lady Constance should be branded in\r\nhistory as \"Arthur, the Assassin.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBORRIS, _March 4th._--This is a staunch Protestant house, and Mr.\r\nKavanagh himself reads a Protestant service every morning. But there is\r\nlittle or nothing apparently in this part of Ireland of the bitter\r\nfeeling about and against the Catholics which exists in the North. A\r\nvery lively and pleasant Catholic gentleman came in to-day informally\r\nand joined the house party at luncheon. We all walked out over the\r\nproperty afterwards, visiting quite a different region from that which\r\nwe saw yesterday--different but equally beautiful and striking, and this\r\nCatholic gentleman cited several cases which had fallen within his own\r\nknowledge of priests who begin to feel their moral control of the people\r\nslipping away from them through the operation of the \"Plan of Campaign.\"\r\nI told him what I had heard in regard to one such priest from my\r\necclesiastical friend in Cork. \"It does not surprise me at all,\" he\r\nsaid, \"and, indeed, I not very long ago read precisely such another\r\nletter from a priest in a somewhat similar position. I read it with pain\r\nand shame as a Catholic,\" he continued, \"for it was simply a complete\r\nadmission that the priest, although entirely convinced that his\r\nparishioners were making most unfair demands upon their landlord to whom\r\nthe letter was addressed, felt himself entirely powerless to bring them\r\nto a sense of their misconduct.\" \"Had this priest given in his adhesion\r\nto the Plan of Campaign?\" I asked. \"Yes,\" was the reply, \"and it was\r\nthis fact which had broken his hold on the people when he tried to bring\r\nthem to abandon their attitude under the Plan. His letter was really\r\nnothing more nor less than an appeal to the landlord, and that landlord\r\na Protestant, to help him to get out of the hole into which he had put\r\nhimself.\"\r\n\r\nOf the tenants and their relation to the village despots who administer\r\nthe Plan of Campaign, this gentleman had many stories also to tell of\r\nthe same tenor with all that I have hitherto heard on this subject.\r\nEverywhere it is the same thing. The well-to-do and well-disposed\r\ntenants are coerced by the thriftless and shiftless. \"I have the\r\nagencies of several properties,\" he said, \"and in some of the best parts\r\nof Ireland. I have had little or no trouble on any of them, for I have\r\none uniform method. I treat every tenant as if he were the only man I\r\nhad to deal with, study his personal ways and character, humour him, and\r\nget him on my side against himself. You can always do this with an\r\nIrishman if you will take the trouble to do it. Within the past years I\r\nhave had tenants come and tell me they were in fear the Plan of Campaign\r\nwould be brought upon them, just as if it were a kind of potato disease,\r\nand beg me to agree to take the rent from them in that case, and just\r\nnot discover on them that they had paid it before it was due!\"\r\n\r\nThis gentleman is a pessimist as to the future. \"I am a youngish man\r\nstill,\" he said, \"and a single man, and I am glad of it. I don't believe\r\nthe English will ever learn how to govern this country, and I am sure it\r\ncan never govern itself. Would your people make a State of it?\"\r\n\r\nTo this I replied that with Cuba and Canada and Mexico, all still to be\r\ndigested and assimilated, I thought the deglutition of Ireland by the\r\ngreat Republic must be remitted to a future much too remote to interest\r\neither of us.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose so,\" he said in a humorously despondent tone; \"and so I see\r\nnothing for people who think as I do, but Australia or New Zealand!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Kavanagh sees the future, I think, in colouring not quite so dark.\r\nAs a public man, familiar for years with the method and ways of British\r\nParliaments, he seems to regard the possible future legislation of\r\nWestminster with more anxiety and alarm than the past or present\r\nagitations in Ireland. The business of banishing political economy to\r\nJupiter and Saturn, however delightful it may be to the people who make\r\nlaws, is a dangerous one to the people for whom the laws are made. While\r\nhe has very positive opinions as to the wisdom of the concession made in\r\nthe successive Land Acts for Ireland, which have been passed since 1870,\r\nhe is much less disquieted, I think, by those concessions, than by the\r\nspirit by which the legislation granting them has been guided. He thinks\r\ngreat good has been already done by Mr. Balfour, and that much more good\r\nwill be done by him if the Irish people are made to feel that clamorous\r\nresistance to the law will no longer be regarded at Westminster as a\r\nsufficient reason for changing the law. That is as much as to say that\r\nparty spirit in Great Britain is the chief peril of Ireland to-day. And\r\nhow can any Irishman, no matter what his state in his own country may\r\nbe, or his knowledge of Irish affairs, or his patriotic earnestness and\r\ndesire for Irish prosperity, hope to control the tides of party spirit\r\nin England or Scotland?\r\n\r\nOf the influence upon the people in Ireland of the spirit of recent\r\nlegislation for Ireland, the story of the troubles on the O'Grady\r\nestate, as Mr. Kavanagh tells it to me, is a most striking illustration.\r\n\"The O'Grady of Kilballyowen,\" as his title shows, is the direct\r\nrepresentative, not of any Norman invader, but of an ancient Irish race.\r\nThe O'Gradys were the heads of a sept of the \"mere Irish\"; and if there\r\nbe such a thing--past, present, or future--as an \"Irish nation,\" the\r\nplace of the O'Gradys in that nation ought to be assumed. Mr. Thomas De\r\nCourcy O'Grady, who now wears the historic designation, owns and lives\r\non an estate of a little more than 1000 acres, in the Golden Vein of\r\nIreland, at Killmallock, in the county of Limerick. The land is\r\nexcellent, and for the last half-century certainly it has been let to\r\nthe tenants at rents which must be considered fair, since they have\r\nnever been raised. In 1845, two years before the great famine, the\r\nrental was £2142. This rental was paid throughout the famine years\r\nwithout difficulty; and in 1881 the rental stood at £2108.\r\n\r\nThere has never been an eviction on the estate until last year, when six\r\ntenants were evicted. All of these lived in good comfortable houses, and\r\nwere prosperous dairy-farmers. Why were they evicted?\r\n\r\nIn October 1886, during the candidacy at New York of the Land Reformer,\r\nMr. George, Mr. Dillon, M.P., propounded the \"Plan of Campaign\" at\r\nPortumna in Galway. The March rents being then due on the estate of The\r\nO'Grady in Limerick, his agent, Mr. Shine, was directed to continue the\r\nabatements of 15 per cent, on the judicial rents, and of 25 per cent, on\r\nall other rents, which had been cheerfully accepted in 1885. But there\r\nwas a priest at Kilballyowen, Father Ryan, who wrought upon the tenants\r\nuntil they demanded a general abatement of 40 per cent. This being\r\nrefused, they asked for 30 per cent. on the judicial rents, and 40 per\r\ncent. on the others. This also being refused, Father Ryan had his way,\r\nand the \"Plan of Campaign\" was adopted. The O'Grady's writs issued\r\nagainst several of the tenants were met by a \"Plan of Campaign\" auction\r\nof cattle at Herbertstown in December 1886, the returns of which were\r\npaid into \"the Fund.\" For this, one of the tenants, Thomas Moroney, who\r\nheld, besides a a farm of 37 Irish acres, a \"public,\" and five small\r\nhouses, at Herbertstown, and the right to the tolls on cattle at the\r\nHerbertstown farm, valued at from £50 to £60 a year, and who held all\r\nthese at a yearly rent of £85, was proceeded against. Judge Boyd\r\npronounced him a bankrupt.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1887, after The O'Grady had been put to great costs and\r\ntrouble, the tenants made a move. They offered to accept a general\r\nabatement of 17-1/2 per cent., \"The O'Grady to pay all the costs.\"\r\n\r\nHere is the same story again of the small solicitors behind the \"Plan of\r\nCampaign\" promoting the strife, and counting on the landlords to defray\r\nthe charges of battle!\r\n\r\nThe O'Grady responded with the following circular:--\r\n\r\n    KlLLBALLYOWEN, BRUFF, CO. LlMERICK,\r\n\r\n    _13th August 1877_.\r\n\r\n    To my Tenants on Kilballyowen and Herbertstown Estate, Co.\r\n    Limerick.\r\n\r\n    MY FRIENDS,--Pending the evictions by the Sheriff on my estate,\r\n    caused by your refusal to pay judicial rents on offers of liberal\r\n    abatements, I desire to remind you of the following facts:--\r\n\r\n    I am a resident landlord; my ancestors have dwelt amongst you for\r\n    over 400 years; every tenant is personally known to me, and the\r\n    most friendly relations have always existed between us.\r\n\r\n    I am not aware of there ever having been an eviction by the Sheriff\r\n    on my estate.\r\n\r\n    Farming myself over 400 acres, and my late agent (Mr. Shine), a\r\n    tenant farmer living within four miles of my property, I have every\r\n    opportunity of realising and knowing your wants.\r\n\r\n    On the passing of the Land Act of 1881, I desired you to have any\r\n    benefit it could afford you, and as you nearly all held under\r\n    lease--which precluded you from going into court--I intimated to\r\n    you my wish, and offered you to allow your lands to be valued at my\r\n    expense, or to let you go into court and get your rents fixed by\r\n    the sub-commissioners.\r\n\r\n    You elected to have a valuation made, and Mr. Edmond Moroney was\r\n    agreed on as a land-valuer, possessing the confidence of tenants\r\n    and landlord.\r\n\r\n    I may mention, up to then I had not known Mr. Moroney personally.\r\n\r\n    In 1883 Mr. Moroney valued your holdings, and, as a result, his\r\n    valuation was accepted (except in three or four cases), and\r\n    judicial agreements signed by you, at rents ascertained by Mr.\r\n    Moroney's valuation.\r\n\r\n    The late Patrick Hogan objected to Mr. Moroney's valuation of his\r\n    farm, and went into court, and had his rent fixed by the County\r\n    Court Judge.\r\n\r\n    Thomas Moroney would not allow Mr. Edmond Moroney to value his\r\n    holding, nor would he go into court, his reason no doubt being he\r\n    should disclose the receipts of the amount of the tolls of the\r\n    fairs.\r\n\r\n    The rents were subsequently paid on Mr. Moroney's valuation with\r\n    punctuality.\r\n\r\n    In 1885, recognising the fall in prices of stock and produce, and\r\n    at the request of my late agent, Mr. Shine, I directed him to allow\r\n    you 15 per cent. on all judicial rents, or rents abated on Mr.\r\n    Moroney's valuation, and 25 per cent. on all other rents, when you\r\n    paid punctually and with thanks.\r\n\r\n    In October last, when calling in the March 1886 rents, at the\r\n    instance of Mr. Shine, I agreed to continue the abatement of 15 per\r\n    cent, and 25 per cent., which, when intimated to you, were refused,\r\n    and a meeting held, demanding an all-round abatement of 40 per\r\n    cent.\r\n\r\n    This I considered unreasonable and unjust, and I refused to give\r\n    it.\r\n\r\n    The Plan of Campaign was then most unjustly adopted on the estate,\r\n    and you refused to pay your rents.\r\n\r\n    Thomas Moroney was elected as a test case to try the legality of\r\n    the sale and removal of your property to avoid payment of your\r\n    rent. His tenancy was a mixed holding of house property in the\r\n    village of Herbertstown, the tolls of the fairs, and 37 acres of\r\n    land, at a rent of £85, and a Poor-Law valuation of £73, 5s., made\r\n    as follows:--\r\n\r\n    Land valued                  at £42 5 0\r\n    Tolls of fair                at  17 0 0\r\n    Public house and yard        at  11 0 0\r\n    Five small houses and forge  at   3 0 0\r\n                                   --------\r\n                                    £73 5 0\r\n\r\n    I always was led to believe the tolls of the fair averaged from £50\r\n    to £60 a year, there being four fairs in the year; and I believe\r\n    his reason for refusing to allow Mr. E. Moroney to value his\r\n    holding, or to go into court, was that he should disclose the\r\n    amount of the tolls, and in consequence I never considered he was\r\n    entitled to any abatement; but still I gave it to him, and was\r\n    prepared to do so. The result of his case was that his conduct in\r\n    making away with his property was unjustifiable, and his farm and\r\n    holding was sold out for the benefit of his creditors, and he is no\r\n    longer a tenant on the estate.\r\n\r\n    I subsequently took proceedings against six other tenants, who\r\n    refused payment of rent, and removed their cattle off the land to\r\n    avoid payment, and having got judgment against them, the Sheriff\r\n    sold out four of their farms, and writs of possession on the title\r\n    were taken out against them, and are now lodged with the Sheriff\r\n    for execution. I have also got judgments for possession against two\r\n    other tenants for non-payment of rent, also lodged with the\r\n    Sheriff. One the widow of Patrick Hogan, who got his rent fixed in\r\n    the County Court, and the other Mrs. Denis Ryan, whose farm on her\r\n    marriage I assented to be put in settlement for her protection, Mr.\r\n    Shine, my agent, consenting to act as one of her trustees, whose\r\n    name, with his co-trustee, Mr. Thomas FitzGerald, appear as\r\n    defendants, they having signed her judicial agreement.\r\n\r\n    The following are the names of the above tenants, the extent of\r\n    their holdings, the rent, the Poor-Law valuation, and the average\r\n    rent per Irish acre:--\r\n\r\n   +------------------+------------+-------------+---------+-----------+\r\n   |                  | Acreage in |  Judicial   |  Rent   |           |\r\n   |     TENANT.      |   Irish    | Rent Less 20|  per    | Poor Law  |\r\n   |                  |  Measure.  |   per cent. |  acre[A]| Valuation |\r\n   +------------------+------------+-------------+---------+-----------+\r\n   |                  |  A.

Whom has all this advantaged? The\r\ntenants?--Certainly not. The O'Grady?--Certainly not. The peace and\r\norder of Ireland?--Certainly not. But it has given the National League\r\nanother appeal to the intelligent \"sympathies\" of England and America.\r\nIt has strengthened the revolutionary element in Irish society. It has\r\n\"driven another nail into the coffin\" of Irish landlordism and of the\r\nprivate ownership of land throughout Great Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch at least is the opinion of Mr. Kavanagh. If I were an Englishman or\r\na Scotchman, I should be strongly inclined to take very serious account\r\nof this opinion in forecasting the future of landed property in England\r\nor Scotland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREENANE HOUSE, THOMASTOWN, _March 5th._--The breakfast-room at Borris\r\nthis morning was gay with pink coats. A meet was to come off at a place\r\nbetween Borris and Thomastown, and bidding fare-well to my cordial host\r\nand hostess, I set out at 11 o'clock for a flying visit to this quaint\r\nand charming house of Mr. Seigne, one of the best known and most highly\r\nesteemed agents in this part of Ireland.\r\n\r\nMy jarvey from Borris had an unusually neat and well-balanced car. When\r\nI praised it he told me it was \"built by an American,\" not an Irish\r\nAmerican, I understood him to say, but a genuine Yankee, who, for some\r\nmysterious reason, has established himself in this region, where he has\r\nprospered as a cart and car builder ever since. \"Just the best cars in\r\nall Ireland he builds, your honour!\" Why don't he naturalise them in\r\nAmerica?\r\n\r\nAll the way was charming, the day very bright, and even warm, and the\r\nhill scenery picturesque at every turn. We looked out sharply for the\r\nhunt, but in vain. My jarvey, who knew the whole country, said they must\r\nhave broken cover somewhere on the upper road, and we should miss them\r\nentirely. And so we did.\r\n\r\nThe silting up of the river Nore has reduced Thomastown or\r\nBallymacanton, which was its Irish name, from its former importance as\r\nan emporium for the country about Kilkenny. The river now is not\r\nnavigable above Inistiogue. But two martial square towers, one at either\r\nend of a fine bridge which spans the stream here, speak of the good old\r\ntimes when the masters of Thomastown took toll and tribute of traders\r\nand travellers. The lands about the place then belonged to the great\r\nmonastery of Jerpoint, the ruins of which are still the most interesting\r\nof their kind in this part of Ireland. They have long made a part of the\r\nestate of the Butlers. We rattled rapidly through the quiet little town,\r\nand whisking out of a small public square into a sort of wynd between\r\ntwo houses, suddenly found ourselves in the precincts of Grenane House.\r\nThe house takes its name from the old castle of Grenane, an Irish\r\nfortress established here by some native despot long before Thomas\r\nFitz-Anthony the Norman came into the land. The ruins of this castle\r\nstill stand some half a mile away. \"We call the place Candahar,\" said\r\nMr. Seigne, as he came up with two ladies from the meadows below the\r\nhouse, \"because you come into it so suddenly, just as you do into that\r\nOriental town.\" But what a charming occidental place it is! It stands\r\nwell above the river, the slope adorned with many fine old trees, some\r\nof which grow, and grow prosperously, in the queerest and most\r\nimprobable forms, bent double, twisted, but still most green and\r\nvigorous. They have no business under any known theory of arboriculture\r\nto be beautiful, but beautiful they are. The views of the bridge, of the\r\ntowers, and of the river, from this slope would make the fortune of the\r\nplace in a land of peace and order.\r\n\r\nA most original and delightful lady of the country lunched with\r\nus,--such a character as Miss Edgeworth or Miss Austen might have drawn.\r\nShrewd, humorous, sensible, fearless, and ready with impartial hand to\r\nbox the ears alike of Trojan and of Tyrian. She not only sees both sides\r\nof the question in Ireland as between the landlords and the tenants, but\r\ntakes both sides of the question. She holds lands by inheritance, which\r\nmake her keenly alive to the wrongs of the landlords, and she holds\r\nfarms as a tenant, which make her implacably critical as to their\r\nclaims. She mercilessly demolished in one capacity whatever she advanced\r\nin the other, and all with the most perfect nonchalance and good faith.\r\nThis curiously dual attitude reminded me of the confederate General,\r\nBraxton Bragg, of whom his comrades in the old army of the United States\r\nused to say that he once had a very sharp official correspondence with\r\nhimself. He happened to hold a staff appointment, being also a line\r\nofficer. So in his quality of a staff officer, he found fault with\r\nhimself in his capacity as a line officer, reprimanded himself sharply,\r\nreplied defiantly to the reprimand, and eventually reported himself to\r\nhimself for discipline at head-quarters. She told an excellent story of\r\na near kinsman of hers who, holding a very good living in the Protestant\r\nIrish Church, came rather unexpectedly by inheritance into a baronetcy,\r\nupon which his women-folk insisted that it would be derogatory to a\r\nbaronet to be a parson. \"Would you believe it, the poor man was silly\r\nenough to listen to their cackle, and resign seven hundred a year!\"\r\n\r\n\"That didn't clear him,\" I said, \"of the cloth, did it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit, of course, poor foolish man. He was just as much a parson as\r\never, only without a parsonage. Men are fools enough of themselves,\r\ndon't you think, without needing to listen to women?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Seigne comes of a French Protestant stock long ago planted in\r\nIreland, and his Gallic blood doubtless helps him to handle the\r\npractical problems daily submitted in these days to an Irish\r\nland-agent--problems very different, as he thinks, from those with which\r\nan Irish agent had to deal in the days before 1870. The Irish tenant has\r\na vantage-ground now in his relations with his landlord which he never\r\nhad in the olden time, and this makes it more important than it ever was\r\nthat the agent should have what may be called a diplomatic taste for\r\ntreating with individuals, finding out the bent of mind of this man and\r\nof that, and negotiating over particulars, instead of insisting, in the\r\nEnglish fashion, on general rules, without regard to special cases. I\r\nhave met no one who has seemed to me so cool and precise as Mr. Seigne\r\nin his study of the phenomena of the present situation. I asked him\r\nwhether he could now say, as Mr. Senior did a quarter of century ago,\r\nthat the Irish tenants were less improvident, and more averse from\r\nrunning into debt than the English.\r\n\r\n\"I think not,\" he replied; \"on the contrary, in some parts of Ireland\r\nnow the shopkeepers are kept on the verge of bankruptcy by the\r\nrecklessness with which the tenants incurred debts immediately after the\r\npassing of the Land Act of 1870--a time when shopkeepers, and bankers\r\nalso, almost forced credit upon the farmers, and made thereby 'bad\r\ndebts' innumerable. Farmers rarely keep anything like an account of\r\ntheir receipts and expenses. I know only one tenant-farmer in this\r\nneighbourhood who keeps what can be called an account, showing what he\r\ntakes from his labour and spends on his living.\"[20] \"They save a great\r\ndeal of money often,\" he says, \"but almost never in any systematic way.\r\nThey spend much less on clothes and furniture, and the outward show of\r\nthings, than English people of the same condition do, and they do not\r\nstint themselves in meat and drink as the French peasants do. In fact,\r\nunder the operation of existing circumstances, they are getting into the\r\nway of improving their condition, not so much by sacrifices and savings,\r\nas by an insistence on rent being fixed low enough to leave full margin\r\nfor improved living.\"\r\n\r\n\"I had a very frank statement on this point,\" said Mr. Seigne, \"not long\r\nago from a Tipperary man. When I tried to show him that his father had\r\npaid a good many years ago the very same rent which he declares himself\r\nunable to pay now, he admitted this at once. But it was a confession and\r\navoidance. 'My father could pay the rent, and did pay the rent,' he\r\nsaid, 'because he was content to live so that he could pay it. He sat on\r\na boss of straw, and ate out of a bowl. He lived in a way in which I\r\ndon't intend to live, and so he could pay the rent. Now, I must have,\r\nand I mean to have, out of the land, before I pay the rent, the means of\r\nliving as I wish to live; and if I can't have it, I'll sell out and go\r\naway; but I'll be--if I don't fight before I do that same!'\"\r\n\r\n\"What could you reply to that?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" I said, \"'that's square and straightforward. Only just let me know\r\nthe point at which you mean to fight, and then we'll see if we can agree\r\nabout something.'\"\r\n\r\n\"The truth is,\" said Mr. Seigne, \"that there is a pressure upward now\r\nfrom below. The labourers don't want to live any longer as the farmers\r\nhave always made them live; and so the farmers, having to consider the\r\ngrowing demands of the labourers, and meaning to live better themselves,\r\npush up against the landlord, and insist that the means of the\r\nimprovement shall come out of him.\"\r\n\r\nHe then told me an instructive story of his calling upon a\r\ntenant-farmer, at whose place he found the labourers sitting about their\r\nmeal of pork and green vegetables. The farmer asked him into another\r\nroom, where he saw the farmer's family making their meal of stirabout\r\nand milk and potatoes.\r\n\r\n\"I asked you in here,\" said the farmer, \"because we keep in here to\r\nourselves. I don't want those fellows to see that we can't afford to\r\ngive ourselves what we have to give them,\"--this with strong language\r\nindicating that he must himself be given a way to advance equally with\r\nthe progressive labourer, or he would know the reason why!\r\n\r\nThis afternoon Mr. Seigne drove me over through a beautiful country to\r\nWoodstock, near Inistiogue, the seat of the late Colonel Tighe, the head\r\nof the family of which the authoress of \"Psyche\" was an ornament.\r\n\r\nIt is the finest place in this part of Ireland, and one of the finest I\r\nhave seen in the three kingdoms, a much more picturesque and more nobly\r\nplanted place indeed than its namesake in England. The mansion has no\r\narchitectural pretensions, being simply a very large and, I should\r\nthink, extremely comfortable house of the beginning of this century. The\r\nlibrary is very rich, and there are some good pictures, as well as\r\ncertain statues in the vestibule, which would have no interest for the\r\nWeissnichtwo professor of _Sartor Resartus_, but are regarded with some\r\nawe by the good people of Inistiogue.\r\n\r\nThe park would do no discredit to a palace, and if the vague project of\r\nestablishing a royal residence in Ireland for one of the British Princes\r\nshould ever take shape, it would not be easy, I should say, to find a\r\ndemesne more befitting the home of a prince than this of the Tighes. At\r\npresent it serves the State at least as usefully, being the \"pleasaunce\"\r\nof the people for miles around, who come here freely to walk and drive.\r\n\r\nIt stretches for miles along the Nore, and is crowned by a gloriously\r\nwooded hill nearly a thousand feet in height. The late Colonel Tighe, a\r\nmost accomplished man, and a passionate lover of trees, made it a kind\r\nof private Kew Gardens. He planted long avenues of the rarest and finest\r\ntrees, araucarias, Scotch firs, oaks, beeches, cedars of Lebanon; laid\r\nout miles of the most varied and delightful drives, and built the most\r\nextensive conservatories in Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe turfed and terraced walks among those conservatories are\r\nindescribably lovely, and the whole place to-day was vocal with\r\ninnumerable birds. Picturesque little cottages and arbours are to be\r\nfound in unexpected nooks all through the woodlands, each commanding\r\nsome green vista of forest aisles, or some wide view of hill and\r\nchampaign, enlivened by the winding river. From one of those to-day we\r\nlooked out over a landscape to which Turner alone or Claude could have\r\ndone justice, the river, spanned by a fine bridge, in the middle\r\ndistance, and all the region wooded as in the days of which Edmund\r\nSpenser sings, when Ireland\r\n\r\n                      \"Flourished in fame,\r\n    Of wealth and goodnesse far above the rest\r\n    Of all that bears the British Islands' name.\"\r\n\r\nOver the whole place broods an indefinable charm. You feel that this was\r\nthe home at once and the work of a refined and thoughtful spirit. And so\r\nindeed it was. Here for the greater part of the current century the\r\nowner lived, making the development of the estate and of this demesne\r\nhis constant care and chief pleasure. And here still lives his widow,\r\nwith whom we took tea in a stately quiet drawing-room. Lady Louisa Tighe\r\nwas in Brussels with her mother, the Duchess of Richmond, on the eve of\r\nWaterloo. She was a child then of ten years old, and her mother bade\r\nthem bring her down into the historic ball-room before the Duke of\r\nWellington left it. The duke took up his sword. \"Let Louisa buckle it\r\nfor you,\" said her mother, and when the little girl had girded it on,\r\nthe great captain stooped, took her up in his arms, and kissed her. \"One\r\nnever knows what may happen, child,\" he said good-naturedly; and taking\r\nhis small gold watch out of his fob, he bade her keep it for him.\r\n\r\nShe keeps it still. For more than sixty years it has measured out in\r\nthis beautiful Irish home the hours of a life given to good works and\r\ngracious usefulness. To-day, with all the vivacity of interest in the\r\npeople and the place which one might look for in a woman of twenty, this\r\ncharming old lady of eighty-three, showing barely threescore years in\r\nher carriage, her countenance, and her voice, entertained us with minute\r\nand most interesting accounts of the local industries which flourish\r\nhere mainly through her sympathetic and intelligent supervision. We\r\nseemed to be in another world from the Ireland of Chicago or\r\nWestminster!\r\n\r\nMr. Seigne drove me back here by a most picturesque road leading along\r\nthe banks of the Nore, quite overhung with trees, which in places dip\r\ntheir branches almost into the swift deep stream. \"This is the favourite\r\ndrive of all the lovers hereabouts,\" he said, \"and there is a spice of\r\ndanger in it which makes it more romantic. Once, not very long ago, a\r\ncouple of young people, too absorbed in their love-making to watch their\r\nhorse, drove off the bank. Luckily for them they fell into the branches\r\nof one of these overhanging trees, while the horse and car went plunging\r\ninto the water. There they swung, holding each other hand in hand,\r\nmaking a pretty and pathetic tableau, till their cries brought some\r\nanglers in a boat on the river to the rescue.\"\r\n\r\nWe spoke of Lady Louisa, and of the watch of Waterloo. \"That watch had a\r\nwonderful escape a few years ago,\" said Mr. Seigne.\r\n\r\nLady Louisa, it seems, had a confidential butler whom she most\r\nimplicitly trusted. One day it was found that a burglary had apparently\r\nbeen committed at Woodstock, and that with a quantity of jewelry the\r\npriceless watch had vanished. The butler was very active about the\r\nmatter, and as no trace could be found leading out of the house, he\r\nintimated a suspicion that the affair might possibly have some\r\nconnection with a guest not long before at the house. This angered Lady\r\nLouisa, who thereupon consulted the agent, who employed a capable\r\ndetective from Dublin. The detective came down to Inistiogue as a\r\ncommercial traveller, wandered about, made the acquaintance of Lady\r\nLouisa's maid, of the butler, and of other people about the house, and\r\nformed his own conclusions. Two or three days after his arrival he\r\nwalked into the shop of a small jeweller in a neighbouring town, and\r\naffecting a confidential manner, told the jeweller he wanted to buy\r\n\"some of those things from Woodstock.\" The man was taken by surprise,\r\nand going into a backshop produced one very fine diamond, and a number\r\nof pieces of silver plate, of the disappearance of which the butler had\r\nsaid nothing to his mistress. This led to the arrest of the butler, and\r\nto the discovery that for a long time he had been purloining property\r\nfrom the house and selling it. Many cases of excellent claret had found\r\ntheir way in this fashion to a public-house which had acquired quite a\r\nreputation for its Bordeaux with the officers quartered in its\r\nneighbourhood. The wine-bins at Woodstock were found full of bottles of\r\nwater. Much of the capital port left by Colonel Tighe had gone--but the\r\nhock was untouched. \"Probably the butler didn't care for hock,\" said Mr.\r\nSeigne. The Waterloo watch was recovered from a very decent fellow, a\r\ntravelling dealer, to whom it had been sold: and many pieces of jewelry\r\nwere traced up to London. But Lady Louisa could not be induced to go up\r\nto London to identify them or testify.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUBLIN, _Tuesday, March 6._--It is a curious fact, which I learned\r\nto-day from the Registrar-General, that the deposits in the Post-office\r\nSavings Banks have never diminished in Ireland since these banks were\r\nestablished.[21] These deposits are chiefly made, I understand, by the\r\nsmall tenants, who are less represented by the deposits in the General\r\nSavings Banks than are the shopkeepers and the cattle-drovers. In the\r\nGeneral Savings Banks the deposit line fluctuates more; though on the\r\nwhole there has been a steady increase in these deposits also throughout\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nOf the details of the dealings of the private banks it is very hard to\r\nget an accurate account. One gentleman, the manager of a branch of one\r\nimportant bank, tells me that a great deal of money is made by usurers\r\nout of the tenants, by backing their small bills. This practice goes\r\nback to the first establishment of banks in Ireland. Formerly it was not\r\nan uncommon thing for a landlord to offer his tenants a reduction, say,\r\nof twenty per cent., on condition of their paying the rent when it fell\r\ndue. Such were the relations then between landlord and tenants, and so\r\nlittle was punctuality expected in such payments that this might be\r\nregarded as a sort of discount arrangement. The tenant who wished to\r\navail himself of such an offer would go to some friendly local usurer\r\nand ask for a loan that he might avail himself of it. \"One of these\r\nusurers, whom I knew very well,\" said the manager, \"told me long ago\r\nthat he found these operations very profitable. His method of procedure\r\nwas to agree to advance the rent to the tenant at ten per cent., payable\r\nat a near and certain date. This would reduce the landlord's reduction\r\nat once, of course, for the tenant, to ten per cent., but that was not\r\nto be disdained; and so the bargain would be struck. If the money was\r\nrepaid at the fixed date, it was not a bad thing for the usurer. But it\r\nwas almost never so repaid; and with repeated renewals the usurer, by\r\nhis own showing, used to receive eventually twenty, fifty, and, in some\r\ncases, nearly a hundred per cent, for his loan.\"\r\n\r\nIt is the opinion of this gentleman that, under the \"Plan of Campaign,\"\r\na good deal of money-making is done in a quiet way by some of the\r\n\"trustees,\" who turn over at good interest, with the help of friendly\r\nfinanciers, the funds lodged with them, being held to account to the\r\ntenants only for the principal. \"Of course,\" he said, \"all this is\r\ndoubtless at least as legitimate as any other part of the 'Plan,' and I\r\ndaresay it all goes for 'the good of the cause.' But neither the tenants\r\nnor the landlords get much by it!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUBLIN, _Thursday, March 8._--At eight o'clock this morning I left the\r\nHarcourt Street station for Inch, to take a look at the scene of the\r\nCoolgreany evictions of last summer. These evictions came of the\r\nadoption of the Plan of Campaign, under the direction of Mr. Dillon,\r\nM.P., on the Wexford property of Mr. George Brooke of Dublin. The agent\r\nof Mr. Brooke's estate, Captain Hamilton, is the honorary director of\r\nthe Property Defence Association, so that we have here obviously a\r\ngrapple between the National League doing the work, consciously or\r\nunconsciously, of the agrarian revolutionists, and a combination of\r\nlanded proprietors fighting for the rights of property as they\r\nunderstand them.\r\n\r\nWe ran through a beautiful country for the greater part of the way. At\r\nBray, which is a favourite Irish watering-place, the sea broke upon us\r\nbright and full of life; and the station itself was more like a\r\nconsiderable English station than any I have seen. Thence we passed into\r\na richly-wooded region, with neat, well-kept hedges, as far as Rathdrum\r\nand the \"Sweet Vale of Avoca.\" The hills about Shillelagh are\r\nparticularly well forested, though, as the name suggests, they must have\r\nbeen cut for cudgels pretty extensively for now a great many years. We\r\ncame again on the sea at the fishing port of Arklow, where the stone\r\nwalls about the station were populous with small ragamuffins, and at the\r\nstation of Inch I found a car waiting for me with Mr. Holmes, a young\r\nEnglish Catholic officer, who had most obligingly offered to show me the\r\nplace and the people. We had hardly got into the roadway when we\r\novertook a most intelligent-looking, energetic young priest, walking\r\nbriskly on in the direction of our course. This was Dr. Dillon, the\r\ncurate of Arklow. We pulled up at once, and Mr. Holmes, introducing me\r\nto him, we begged him to take a seat with us. He excused himself as\r\nhaving to join another priest with whom he was going to a function at\r\nInch; but he was good enough to walk a little way with us, and gave me\r\nan appointment for 2 P.M. at his own town of Arklow, where I could catch\r\nthe train back to Dublin. We drove on rapidly and called on Father\r\nO'Neill, the parish priest. We found him in full canonicals, as he was\r\nto officiate at the function this morning, and with him were Father\r\nDunphy, the parish priest of Arklow, and two or three more robed\r\npriests.\r\n\r\nFather O'Neill, whose face and manner are those of the higher order of\r\nthe continental clergy, briefly set forth to me his view of the\r\ntransactions at Coolgreany. He said that before the Plan of Campaign was\r\nadopted by the tenants, Mr. William O'Brien, M.P., had written to him\r\nexplaining what the effect of the Plan would be, and urging him to take\r\nwhatever steps he could to obviate the necessity of adopting it, as it\r\nmight eventually result to the disadvantage of the tenants. \"To that\r\nend,\" said Father O'Neill, \"I called upon Captain Hamilton, the agent,\r\nwith Dr. Dillon of Arklow, but he positively refused to listen to us,\r\nand in fact ordered us, not very civilly, to leave his office.\"\r\n\r\nIt was after this he said that he felt bound to let the tenants take\r\ntheir own way. Eighty of them joined in the \"Plan of Campaign\" and paid\r\nthe amount of the rent due, less a reduction of 30 per cent., which they\r\ndemanded of the agent, into the hands of Sir Thomas Esmonde, M.P., Sir\r\nThomas being a resident in the country, and Mr. Mayne, M.P. Writs of\r\nejectment were obtained against them afterwards, and in July last\r\nsixty-seven of them were evicted, who are now living in \"Laud League\r\nhuts,\" put up on the holdings of three small tenants who were exempted\r\nfrom the Plan of Campaign, and allowed to pay their rents subject to a\r\nsmaller reduction made by the agent, in order that they might retain\r\ntheir land as a refuge for the rest.\r\n\r\nAll this Father O'Neill told us very quietly, in a gentle,\r\nundemonstrative way, but he was much interested when I told him I had\r\nrecently come from Rome, where these proceedings, I was sure, were\r\nexciting a good deal of serious attention. \"Yes,\" he said, \"and Father\r\nDunphy who is here in the other room, has just got back from Rome, where\r\nhe had two audiences of the Holy Father.\"\r\n\r\n\"Doubtless, then,\" I said, \"he will have given his Holiness full\r\nparticulars of all that took place here.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt,\" responded Father O'Neill, \"and he tells me the Holy Father\r\nlistened with great attention to all he had to say--though of course, he\r\nexpressed no opinion about it to Father Dunphy.\"\r\n\r\nAs the time fixed for the function was at hand, we were obliged to leave\r\nwithout seeing Father Dunphy.\r\n\r\nFrom the Presbytery we drove to the scene of the evictions. These\r\nevictions were in July. Mr. Holmes witnessed them, and gave me a lively\r\naccount of the affair. The \"battle\" was not a very tough one. Mr.\r\nDavitt, who was present, stood under a tree very quietly watching it\r\nall. \"He looked very picturesque,\" said Mr. Holmes, \"in a light grey\r\nsuit, with a broad white beaver shading his dark Spanish face; and\r\nsmoked his cigar very composedly.\" After it was over, Dr. Dillon brought\r\nup one of the tenants, and presented him to Mr. Davitt as \"the man who\r\nhad resisted this unjust eviction.\" Mr. Davitt took his cigar from his\r\nlips, and in the hearing of all who stood about sarcastically said,\r\n\"Well, if he couldn't make a better resistance than that he ought to go\r\nup for six months!\" The first house we came upon was derelict--all\r\nbattered and despoiled, the people in the neighbourhood here, as\r\nelsewhere, regarding such houses as free spoil, and carrying off from\r\ntime to time whatever they happen to fancy. Near this house we met an\r\nemergency man, named Bolton, an alert, energetic-looking native of\r\nWicklow. He has four brothers; and is now at work on one of the\r\n\"evicted\" holdings.\r\n\r\nI asked if he was \"boycotted,\" and what his relations were with the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nHe laughed in a shrewd, good-natured way. \"Oh, I'm boycotted, of\r\ncourse,\" he said; \"but I don't care a button for any of these people,\r\nand I'd rather they wouldn't speak to me. They know I can take care of\r\nmyself, and they give me a good wide berth. All I have to object to is\r\nthat they set fire to an outhouse of mine, and cut the ears of one of my\r\nheifers, and for that I want damages. Otherwise I'm getting on very\r\nwell; and I think this will be a good year, if the law is enforced, and\r\nthese fellows are made to behave themselves.\"\r\n\r\nNear Bolton's farm we passed the holding of a tenant named Kavanagh, one\r\nof the three who were \"allowed\" to pay their rents. Several Land League\r\nhuts are on his place, and the evicted people who occupy them put their\r\ncattle with his. He is a quiet, cautious man, and very reticent. But it\r\nseemed to me that he was not entirely satisfied with the \"squatters\" who\r\nhave been quartered upon him. And it appears that he has taken another\r\nholding in Carlow. From his place we drove to Ballyfad, where a large\r\nhouse, at the end of a good avenue of trees, once the mansion of a\r\nsquire, but now much dilapidated, is occupied as headquarters by the\r\npolice. Here we found Mr. George Freeman, the bailiff of the Coolgreany\r\nproperty, a strong, sturdy man, much disgusted at finding it necessary\r\nto go about protected by two policemen. That this was necessary,\r\nhowever, he admitted, pointing out to us the place where one Kinsella\r\nwas killed not very long ago. The son of this man Kinsella was formerly\r\none of Mr. Brooke's gamekeepers, and is now, Mr. Freeman thinks, in\r\nconcert with another man named Ryan, the chief stay of the League in\r\nkeeping up its dominion over the evicted tenants.\r\n\r\nMany of these tenants, he believes, would gladly pay their rents now,\r\nand come back if they dared.\r\n\r\n\"Every man, sir,\" he said, \"that has anything to lose, would be glad to\r\ncome back next Monday if he thought his life would be safe. But all the\r\nlazy and thriftless ones are better off now than they ever were; they\r\nget from £4 to £6 a month, with nothing to do, and so they're in clover,\r\nand they naturally don't like to have the industrious, well-to-do\r\ntenants spoil their fun by making a general settlement.\"\r\n\r\n\"Besides that,\" he added, \"that man Kinsella and his comrade Ryan are\r\nthe terror of the whole of them. Kinsella always was a curious, silent,\r\nmoody fellow. He knows every inch of the country, going over it all the\r\ntime by night and day as a gamekeeper, and I am quite sure the\r\nParnellite men and the Land Leaguers are just as much afraid of him and\r\nRyan as the tenants are. He don't care a bit for them; and they've no\r\ncontrol of him at all.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Freeman said he remembered very well the occasion referred to by\r\nFather O'Neill, when Captain Hamilton refused to confer with Dr. Dillon\r\nand himself.\r\n\r\n\"Did Father O'Neill tell you, sir,\" he said, \"that Captain Hamilton was\r\nquite willing to talk with him and Father O'Donel, the parish priests,\r\nand with the Coolgreany people, but he would have nothing to say to any\r\none who was not their priest, and had no business to be meddling with\r\nthe matter at all?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; he did not tell me that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! well, sir, that made all the difference. Father Dunphy, who was\r\nthere, is a high-tempered man, and he said he had just as much right to\r\nrepresent the tenants as Captain Hamilton to represent the landlord, and\r\nthat Captain Hamilton wouldn't allow. It was the outside people made all\r\nthe trouble. In June of last year there was a conference at my house,\r\nand all that time there was a Committee sitting at Coolgreany, and the\r\ntenants would not be allowed to do anything without the Committee.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who made the Committee?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, they made themselves, I suppose, sir. There was Sir Thomas\r\nEsmonde--he was a convert, you know, of Father O'Neill--and Mr. Mayne\r\nand Mr. John Dillon. And Dr. Dillon of Arklow, he was as busy as he\r\ncould be till the evictions were made in July. And then he was in\r\nretreat. And I believe, sir, it is quite true that he wanted the Bishop\r\nto let him come out of the retreat just to have a hand in the business.\"\r\n\r\nThe police sergeant, a very cool, sensible man, quite agreed with the\r\nbailiff as to the influence upon the present situation of the\r\nex-gamekeeper Kinsella, and his friend Eyan. \"If they were two\r\nInvincibles, sir,\" he said, \"these member fellows of the League couldn't\r\nbe in greater fear of them than they are. They say nothing, and do just\r\nas they please. That Kinsella, when Mr. John Dillon was down here, just\r\ntold him before a lot of people that he 'wanted no words and no advice\r\nfrom him,' and he's just in that surly way with all the people about.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the Brooke estate, I am told here it was bought more than twenty\r\nyears ago with a Landed Estates Court title from Colonel Forde, by the\r\ngrandfather of Mr. Brooke. He paid about £75,000 sterling for it. His\r\nson died young, and the present owner came into it as a child, Mr. Vesey\r\nbeing then the agent, who, during the minority, spent a great deal on\r\nimproving the property. Captain Hamilton came in as agent only a few\r\nyears ago. While the Act of 1881 was impending, an abatement was granted\r\nof more than twenty per cent. In 1882 the tenants all paid except\r\neleven, who went into Court and got their rents cut down by the\r\nSub-Commissioners. There were appeals; and in 1885, after Court\r\nvaluations, the rents cut down by the Sub-Commissioners were restored in\r\nseveral cases. There never was any rack-renting on the estate at all.\r\nThere are upon it in all more than a hundred tenants, twelve of whom are\r\nProtestants, holding a little less in all than one-fourth of the\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nThere are fifteen judicial tenants, twenty-one lease-holders, and\r\nseventy-seven hold from year to year.\r\n\r\nThe gross rental is a little over £2000 a year of which one-half goes to\r\nMr. Brooke's mother. Mr. Brooke himself is a wealthy man, at the head of\r\nthe most important firm of wine-merchants in Ireland, and he has\r\nrepeatedly spent on the property more than he took out of it.\r\n\r\nThe house of Sir Thomas Esmonde, M.P., was pointed out to me from the\r\nroad. \"Sir Thomas is to marry an heiress, sir, isn't he, in America?\"\r\nasked an ingenuous inquirer. I avowed my ignorance on this point. \"Oh,\r\nwell, they say so, for anyway the old house is being put in order for\r\nnow the first time in forty years.\"\r\n\r\nWe reached Arklow in time for luncheon, and drove to the large police\r\nbarracks there. These were formerly the quarters of the troops. Arklow\r\nwas one of the earliest settlements of the Anglo-Normans in Ireland\r\nunder Henry II., and once rejoiced in a castle and a monastery both now\r\nobliterated; though a bit of an old tower here is said to have been\r\nerected in his time. The town lives by fishing, and by shipping copper\r\nand lead ore to South Wales. The houses are rather neat and well kept;\r\nbut the street was full of little ragged, merry mendicants.\r\n\r\nWe went into a small branch of the Bank of Ireland, and asked where we\r\nshould find the hotel. We were very civilly directed to \"The Register's\r\nOffice over the way.\" This seemed odd enough. But reaching it we were\r\nfurther puzzled to see the sign over the doorway of a \"coach-builder\"!\r\nHowever, we rang the bell, and presently a maid-servant appeared, who\r\nassured us that this was really the hotel, and that we could have\r\n\"whatever we liked\" for luncheon. We liked what we found we could\r\nget--chops, potatoes, and parsnips; and without too much delay these\r\nwere neatly served to us in a most remarkable room, ablaze with mural\r\nornaments and decorations, upon which every imaginable pigment of the\r\nmodern palette seemed to have been lavished, from a Nile-water-green\r\ndado to a scarlet and silver frieze. There were five times as many\r\npotatoes served to us as two men could possibly eat, and not one of them\r\nwas half-boiled. But otherwise the meal was well enough, and the service\r\nexcellent. Beer could be got for us, but the house had no licence, Lord\r\nCarysfort, the owner of the property, thinking, so our hostess said,\r\nthat \"there were too many licences in the town already.\" Lord Carysfort\r\nis probably right; but it is not every owner of a house, or even of a\r\nlease in Ireland, I fear, who would take such a view and act on it to\r\nthe detriment of his own property.\r\n\r\nDr. Dillon lives in the main square of Arklow in a very neat house. He\r\nwas absent at a funeral in the handsome Catholic church near by when we\r\ncalled, but we were shown into his study, and he presently came in.\r\n\r\nHis study was that of a man of letters and of politics. Blue-books and\r\nstatistical works lay about in all directions, and on the table were the\r\nMarch numbers of the _Nineteenth Century_, and the _Contemporary\r\nReview_.\r\n\r\n\"You are abreast of the times, I see,\" I said to him, pointing to these\r\nperiodicals.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he replied, \"they have just come in; and there is a capital paper\r\nby Mr. John Morley in this _Nineteenth Century_.\"\r\n\r\nNothing could be livelier than Dr. Dillon's interest in all that is\r\ngoing on on both sides of the Atlantic, more positive than his opinions,\r\nor more terse and clear than his way of putting them. He agreed entirely\r\nwith Father O'Neill as to the pressure put upon the Coolgreany tenants,\r\nnot so much by Mr. Brooke as by the agent, Captain Hamilton; but he\r\nthought Mr. Brooke also to blame for his treatment of them.\r\n\r\n\"Two of the most respectable of them,\" said Dr. Dillon, \"went to see Mr.\r\nBrooke in Dublin, and he wouldn't listen to them. On the contrary, he\r\nabsolutely put them out of his office without hearing a word they had to\r\nsay.\"[22]\r\n\r\nI found Dr. Dillon a strong disciple of Mr. Henry George, and a firm\r\nbeliever in the doctrine of the \"nationalisation of the land.\" \"It is\r\ncertain to come,\" he said, \"as certain to come in Great Britain as in\r\nIreland, and the sooner the better. The movement about the sewerage\r\nrates in London,\" he added, \"is the first symptom of the land war in\r\nLondon. It is the thin edge of the wedge to break down landlordism in\r\nthe British metropolis.\"\r\n\r\nHe is watching American politics, too, very closely, and inclines to\r\nsympathise with President Cleveland. Archbishop Ryan of Philadelphia, he\r\ntells me, in his passage through Ireland the other day, did not hesitate\r\nto express his conviction that President Cleveland would be re-elected.\r\n\r\nDr. Dillon was so earnest and so interesting that the time slipped by\r\nvery fast, until a casual glance at my watch showed me that we must make\r\ngreat haste to catch the Dublin train.\r\n\r\nWe left therefore rather hurriedly, but before reaching the station we\r\nsaw the Dublin train go careering by, its white pennon of smoke and\r\nvapour curling away along the valley.\r\n\r\nI made the best of it, however, and letting Mr. Holmes depart by a train\r\nwhich took him home, I found a smart jarvey with a car, and drove out to\r\nGlenart Castle, the beautiful house of the Earl of Carysfort. This is a\r\nvery handsome modern house, built in a castellated style of a very good\r\nwhitish grey marble, with extensive and extremely well-kept terraced\r\ngardens and conservatories.\r\n\r\nIt stands very well on one high bank of the river, a residence of the\r\nEarl of Wicklow occupying the other bank. My jarvey called my attention\r\nto the excellence of the roads, on which he said Lord Carysfort has\r\nspent \"a deal of money,\" as well as upon the gardens of the new Castle.\r\nThe head-gardener, an Englishman, told me he found the native labourers\r\nvery intelligent and willing both to learn and to work. Evidently here\r\nis another centre of useful and civilising influences, not managed by an\r\n\"absentee.\"[23]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUBLIN, _Friday, March 9th._--At 7.40 this morning I took the train for\r\nAthy to visit the Luggacurren estates of Lord Lansdowne. Mr. Lynch, a\r\nresident magistrate here, some time ago kindly offered to show me over\r\nthe place, but I thought it as well to take my chance with the people of\r\nAthy who are reported to have been very hot over the whole matter here,\r\nand so wrote to Mr. Lynch that I would find him at the Lodge, which is\r\nthe headquarters of the property.\r\n\r\nAthy is a neat, well-built little town, famous of old as a frontier\r\nfortress of Kildare. An embattled tower, flanked by small square\r\nturrets, guards a picturesque old bridge here over the Barrow, the\r\nbridge being known in the country as \"Crom-a-boo,\" from the old war-cry\r\nof the Fitz-Geralds. It is a busy place now; and there was quite a\r\nbustle at the very pretty little station. I asked a friendly old porter\r\nwhich was the best hotel in the town. \"The best? Ah! there's only one,\r\nand it's not the best--but there are worse--and it's Kavanagh's.\" I\r\nfound it easily enough, and was ushered by a civil man, who emerged from\r\nthe shop which occupies part of it, into a sort of reading-room with a\r\ngreen table. A rather slatternly but very active girl soon converted\r\nthis into a neat breakfast-table, and gave me an excellent breakfast.\r\nThe landlord found me a good car, and off I set for the residence of\r\nFather Maher, the curate of whom I had heard as one of the most fiery\r\nand intractable of the National League priests in this part of Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy jarvey was rather taciturn at first, but turned out to be something\r\nof a politician. He wanted Home Rule, one of his reasons being that then\r\nthey \"wouldn't let the Americans come and ruin them altogether, driving\r\nout the grain from the markets.\" About this he was very clear and\r\npositive. \"Oh, it doesn't matter now whether the land is good or bad,\r\nAmerica has just ruined the farmers entirely.\"\r\n\r\nI told him I had always heard this achievement attributed to England.\r\n\"Oh! that was quite a mistake! What the English did was to punish the\r\nmen that stood up for Ireland. There was Mr. O'Brien. But for him there\r\nwasn't a man of Lord Lansdowne's people would have had the heart to\r\nstand up. He did it all; and now, what were they doing to him? They were\r\nputting him on a cold plank-bed on a stone floor in a damp cell!\"\r\n\r\n\"But the English put all their prisoners in those cells, don't they?\" I\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\"And what of it, sir?\" he retorted. \"They're good enough for most of\r\nthem, but not for a gentleman like Mr. O'Brien, that would spill the\r\nlast drop of his heart's blood for Ireland!\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" I said, \"they're doing just the same thing with Mr. Gilhooly, I\r\nhear.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who is Mr. Gilhooly, now? And it's not for the likes of him to\r\ncomplain and be putting on airs as if he was Mr. O'Brien!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is a fine country for hunting!\"\r\n\r\n\"Was it ever put down here, the hunting?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed! Sure, the people wouldn't let it be!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not if Mr. O'Brien told them they must?\" I queried.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. O'Brien; ah, he wouldn't think of such a thing! It brings money all\r\nthe time to Athy, and sells the horses.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the troubles at Luggacurren, he was not very clear. \"It was a\r\nbeautiful place, Mr. Dunne's; we'd see it presently. And Mr. Dunne, he\r\nwas a good one for sport. It was that, your honour, that got him into\r\nthe trouble\"--\r\n\r\n\"And Mr. Kilbride?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Mr. Kilbride's place was a very good place too, but not like Mr.\r\nDunne's. And he was doing very well, Mr. Kilbride. He was getting a good\r\nliving from the League, and he was a Member of Parliament. Oh, yes, he\r\nwasn't the only one of the tenants that was doing good to himself. There\r\nwas more of them that was getting more than ever they made out of the\r\nland.\"[24]\r\n\r\n\"Was the land so bad, then?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"No, there was as good land at Luggacurren as any there was in all\r\nIreland; but,\" and here he pointed off to the crests of the hills in the\r\ndistance, \"there was a deal of land there of the estate on the hills,\r\nand it was very poor land, but the tenants had to pay as much for that\r\nas for the good property of Dunne and Kilbride.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know Mr. Lynch, the magistrate?\" I asked. \"If you do, look out\r\nfor him, as he has promised to join me and show me the place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no, sorr!\" the jarvey exclaimed at once; \"don't mind about him. Hell\r\nhave his own car, and your honour won't want to take him on ours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" I persisted, \"there's plenty of room.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! but indeed, sir, if it wasn't that you were going to the priest's,\r\nFather Maher, you wouldn't get a car at Athy--no, not under ten pounds!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not under ten pounds,\" I replied. \"Would I get one then for ten\r\npounds?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a deal of money, ten pounds, sorr, and you wouldn't have a poor\r\nman throw away ten pounds?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not, nor ten shillings either. Is it a question of principle,\r\nor a question of price?\"\r\n\r\nThe man looked around at me with a droll glimmer in his eye: \"Ah, to be\r\nsure, your honour's a great lawyer; but he'll come pounding along with\r\nhis big horse in his own car, Mr. Lynch; and sure it'll be quicker for\r\nyour honour just driving to Father Maher's.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no resisting this, so I laughed and bade him drive on.\r\n\r\n\"Whose house is that?\" I asked, as we passed a house surrounded with\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! that's the priest, Father Keogh--a very good man, but not so much\r\nfor the people as Father Maher, who has everything to look after about\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nWe came presently within sight of a handsome residence, Lansdowne Lodge,\r\nthe headquarters of the estate. Many fine cattle were grazing in the\r\nfields about it.\r\n\r\n\"They are Lord Lansdowne's beasts,\" said my jarvey; \"and it's the\r\nemergency men are looking after them.\"\r\n\r\nNearly opposite were the Land League huts erected on the holding of an\r\nunevicted tenant--a small village of neat wooden \"shanties.\" On the\r\nroadway in front of these half-a-dozen men were lounging about. They\r\nwatched us with much curiosity as we drove up, and whispered eagerly\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\"They're some of the evicted men, your honour,\" said my jarvey, with a\r\ntwinkle in his eye; and then under his breath, \"They'll be thinking your\r\nhonour's came down to arrange it all. They think everybody that comes is\r\ncome about an arrangement.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, then, they all want it arranged!\"\r\n\r\n\"No; not all, but many of them do. Some of them like it well enough\r\ngoing about like gentlemen with nothing to do, only their hands in their\r\npockets.\"\r\n\r\nWe turned out of the highway here and passed some very pretty cottages.\r\n\r\n\"No, they're not for labourers, your honour,\" said my jarvey; \"the\r\nestate built them for mechanics. It's the tenants look after the\r\nlabourers, and little it is they do for them.\"\r\n\r\nThen, pointing to a ridge of hills beyond us, he said: \"It was\r\nKilbride's father, sir, evicted seventeen tenants on these hills--poor\r\nlabouring men, with their families, many years ago,--and now he's\r\nevicted himself, and a Member of Parliament!\"\r\n\r\nFather Maher's house stands well off from the highway. He was not at\r\nhome, being \"away at a service in the hills,\" but would be back before\r\ntwo o'clock. I left my name for him, with a memorandum of my purpose in\r\ncalling, and we drove on to see the bailiff of the estate, Mr. Hind. On\r\nthe way we met Father Norris, a curate of the parish, in a smart trap\r\nwith a good horse, and had a brief colloquy with him. Mr. Hind we found\r\nbusy afield; a quiet, staunch sort of man. He spoke of the situation\r\nvery coolly and dispassionately. \"The tenants in the main were a good\r\nset of men--as they had reason to be, Lord Lansdowne having been not\r\nonly a fair landlord, but a liberal and enterprising promoter of local\r\nimprovements.\" I had been told in Dublin that Lord Lansdowne had offered\r\na subscription of £200 towards establishing creameries, and providing\r\nhigh-class bulls for this estate. Similar offers had been cordially met\r\nby Lord Lansdowne's tenants in Kerry, and with excellent results. But\r\nhere they were rejected almost scornfully, though accompanied by offers\r\nof abatement on the rents, which, in the case of Mr. Kilbride, for\r\nexample, amounted to 20 per cent.\r\n\r\n\"How did this happen, the tenants being good men as you say?\" I asked of\r\nMr. Hind.\r\n\r\n\"Because they were unable to resist the pressure put on them by the two\r\nchief tenants, Kilbride and Dunne, with the help of the League. Kilbride\r\nand Dunne both lived very well.\" My information at Dublin was that Mr.\r\nKilbride had a fine house built by Lord Lansdowne, and a farm of seven\r\nhundred acres, at a rent of £760, 10s. Mr. Dunne, who co-operated with\r\nhim, held four town lands comprising 1304 acres, at a yearly rent of\r\n£1348, 15s. Upon this property Lord Lansdowne had expended in drainage\r\nand works £1993, 11s. 9d., and in buildings £631, 15s. 4d., or in all\r\nvery nearly two years' rental. On Mr. Kilbride's holdings Lord Lansdowne\r\nhad expended in drainage works £1931, 6s. 3d., and in buildings £1247,\r\n19s. 5d., or in all more than four years' rental. Mr. Kilbride held his\r\nlands on life leases. Mr. Dunne held his smallest holding of 84 acres on\r\na yearly tenure; his two largest holdings, one on a lease for 31 years\r\nfrom 1874, and the other on a life lease, and his fourth holding of 172\r\nacres on a life lease.\r\n\r\nWhere does the hardship appear in all this to Mr. Dunne or Mr. Kilbride?\r\n\r\nOn Mr. Kilbride's holdings, for instance, Lord Lansdowne expended over\r\n£3000, for which he added to the rent £130 a year, or about 4 per cent.,\r\nwhile he himself stood to pay 6-1/2 per cent, on the loans he made from\r\nthe Board of Works for the expenditure. In the same way it was with Mr.\r\nDunne's farms. They were mostly in grass, and Lord Lansdowne laid out\r\nmore than £2500 on them, borrowed at the same rate from the Board, for\r\nwhich he added to the rent only £66 a year, or about 2-1/2 per cent. Mr.\r\nKilbride was a Poor-Law Guardian, and Mr. Dunne a Justice of the Peace.\r\nThe leases in both of these cases, and in those of other large tenants,\r\nseem to have been made at the instance of the tenants themselves, and\r\nafforded security against any advance in the rental during a time of\r\nhigh agricultural prices. And it would appear that for the last quarter\r\nof a century there has been no important advance in the rental. In 1887\r\nthe rental was only £300 higher than in 1862, though during the interval\r\nthe landlord had laid out £20,000 on improvements in the shape of\r\ndrainage, roads, labourers' cottages, and other permanent works.\r\nMoreover, in fifteen years only one tenant has been evicted for\r\nnon-payment of rent.\r\n\r\n\"Was there any ill-feeling towards the Marquis among the tenants?\" I\r\nasked of Mr. Hind.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not, and no reason for any. They were a good set of men, and\r\nthey would never have gone into this fight, only for a few who were in\r\ntrouble, and I'm sure that to-day most of them would be thankful if they\r\ncould settle and get back. The best of them had money enough, and didn't\r\nlike the fight at all.\"\r\n\r\nAll the trouble here seems to have originated with the adoption of the\r\nPlan of Campaign.\r\n\r\nLord Lansdowne, besides this estate in Queen's County, owns property in\r\na wild, mountainous part of the county of Kerry. On this property the\r\ntenants occupy, for the most part, small holdings, the average rental\r\nbeing about £10, and many of the rentals much lower. They are not\r\ncapitalist farmers at all, and few of them are able to average the\r\nprofits of their industry, setting the gains of a good, against the\r\nlosses of a bad, season. In October 1886, while Mr. Dillon was\r\norganising his Plan of Campaign, Lord Lansdowne visited his Kerry\r\nproperty to look into the condition of the people. The local Bank had\r\njust failed, and the shopkeepers and money-lenders were refusing credit\r\nand calling in loans. The pressure they put upon these small farmers,\r\ntogether with the fall in the price of dairy produce and of young stock\r\nat that time, caused real distress, and Lord Lansdowne, after looking\r\ninto the situation, offered, of his own motion, abatements varying from\r\n25 to 35 per cent, to all of them whose rents had not been judicially\r\nfixed under the Act of 1881, for a term of fifteen years.\r\n\r\nAs to these, Lord Lansdowne wrote a letter on the 21st of October 1886\r\n(four days after the promulgation of the Plan of Campaign at Portumna on\r\nthe Clanricarde property), to his agent, Mr. Townsend Trench. This\r\nletter was published. I have a copy of it given to me in Dublin, and it\r\nstates the case as between the landlords and the tenants under judicial\r\nrents most clearly and temperately.\r\n\r\n\"It might, I think,\" says the Marquis, \"be very fairly argued, that the\r\nState having imposed the terms of a contract on landlord and tenant,\r\nthat contract should not be interfered with except by the State.\r\n\r\n\"The punctual payment of the 'judicial rent' was the one advantage to\r\nwhich the landlords were desired to look when, in 1881, they were\r\ndeprived of many of the most valuable attributes of ownership.\r\n\r\n\"It was distinctly stipulated that the enormous privileges which were\r\nsuddenly and unexpectedly conferred upon the tenants were to be enjoyed\r\nby them conditionally upon the fulfilment on their part of the statutory\r\nobligations specified in the Act. Of those, by far the most important\r\nwas the punctual payment of the rent fixed by the Court for the judicial\r\nterm.\r\n\r\n\"This obligation being unfulfilled, the landlord might reasonably claim\r\nthat he should be free to exercise his own discretion in determining\r\nwhether any given tenancy should or should not be perpetuated.\r\n\r\n\"In many cases [such cases are probably not so numerous on my estate as\r\nupon many others] the resumption of the holding, and the consolidation\r\nof adjoining farms, would be clearly advantageous to the whole\r\ncommunity. In the congested districts the consolidation of farms is the\r\nonly solution that I have seen suggested for meeting a chronic\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\n\"I have no reason to believe that the Judicial Rents in force on my\r\nestate are such that, upon an average of the yield and prices of\r\nagricultural produce, my tenants would find it difficult to pay them.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of all these considerations Lord Lansdowne instructed Mr.\r\nTrench to grant to these tenants under judicial leases an abatement of\r\n20 per cent. on the November gale of 1886. This abatement, freely\r\noffered, was gladly accepted. There had been no outrages or disturbances\r\non the Kerry properties, and the relations of the landlord with his\r\ntenants, before and after this visit of Lord Lansdowne to Kerry, and\r\nthese reductions which followed it, had been, and continued to be,\r\nexcellent.\r\n\r\nBut the tale of Kerry reached Luggacurren; and certain of the tenants on\r\nthe latter estate were moved by it to demand for the Queen's County\r\nproperty identical treatment with that accorded to the very differently\r\nsituated property in Kerry.\r\n\r\nThe leaders of the Luggacurren movement, I gather from Mr. Hind, never\r\npretended inability to pay their rents. They simply demanded abatements\r\nof 35 per cent. on non-judicial, and 25 per cent. on judicial, rents as\r\ntheir due, on the ground that they should be treated like the tenants in\r\nKerry: and the Plan of Campaign being by this time in full operation in\r\nmore than one part of Ireland, they threatened to resort to it if their\r\ndemand was refused. Lord Lansdowne at once declared that he would not\r\nrepeat at Luggacurren his concession made in Kerry as to the rents\r\njudicially fixed; but he offered on a fair consideration of the\r\nnon-judicial rents to make abatements on them ranging from 15 to 25 per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nThe offer was refused, and the war began. On the 23d of March 1887 Mr.\r\nKilbride was evicted. One week afterwards, on the 29th of March, he got\r\nup in the rooms of the National League in Dublin, and openly declared\r\nthat \"the Luggacurren evictions differed from most other evictions in\r\nthis, that they were able to pay the rent. It was a fight,\" he\r\nexultingly exclaimed, \"of intelligence against intelligence; it was\r\ndiamond cut diamond!\" In other words, it was a struggle, not for\r\njustice, but for victory.\r\n\r\nOn all these points, and others furnished to me at Dublin touching this\r\nestate, much light was thrown by the bailiff, who had not been concerned\r\nin the evictions. He told me what he knew, and then very obligingly\r\noffered to conduct me to the lodge, where we should find Mr. Hutchins,\r\nwho has charge now of the properties taken up by Mr. Kavanagh's Land\r\nCorporation. My patriotic jarvey from Athy made no objection to my\r\ngiving the bailiff a lift, and we drove off to the lodge. On the way the\r\njarvey good-naturedly exclaimed, \"Ah! there comes Mr. Lynch,\" and even\r\noffered to pull up that the magistrate might overtake us.\r\n\r\nWe found Mr. Hutchins at home, a cool, quiet, energetic, northern man,\r\nwho seems to be handling the difficult situation here with great\r\nfirmness and prudence. Mrs. Hutchins, who has lived here now for nearly\r\na year--a life not unlike that of the wife of an American officer on the\r\nFar Western frontier--very amicably asked me to lunch, and Mr. Hutchins\r\noffered to show me the holdings of Mr. Dunne and Mr. Kilbride. Mr. Lynch\r\nproposed that we should all go on my car, but I remembered the protest\r\nof the jarvey, and sending him to await me at Father Maher's, I drove\r\noff with Mr. Hutchins. As we drove along, he confirmed the jarvey's hint\r\nas to the difference between the views and conduct of the parish priest\r\nand the views and conduct of his more fiery curate. This is a very\r\ncommon state of affairs, I find, all over Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe house of Mr. Dunne is that of a large gentleman farmer. It is very\r\nwell fitted up, but it was plain that the tenants had done little or\r\nnothing to make or keep it a \"house beautiful.\" The walls had never been\r\npapered, and the wood-work showed no recent traces of the brush. \"He\r\nspent more money on horse-racing than on housekeeping,\" said a shrewd\r\nold man who was in the house. In fact, Mr. Dunne, I am told, entered a\r\nhorse for the races at the Curragh after he had undergone what Mr.\r\nGladstone calls \"the sentence of death\" of an eviction!\r\n\r\nSome of the doors bore marks of the crowbar but no great mischief had\r\nbeen done to them or to the large fine windows. The only serious damage\r\ndone during the eviction was the cutting of a hole through the roof. An\r\nupper room had been provisioned to stand a siege, and so scientifically\r\nbarricaded with logs and trunks of trees that after several vain\r\nattempts to break through the door the assailants climbed to the roof,\r\nand in twenty minutes cut their way in from without. The dining and\r\ndrawing rooms were those of a gentleman's residence, and one of the\r\nparty remembered attending here a social festivity got up with much\r\ndisplay.\r\n\r\nA large cattle-yard has been established on this place, with an\r\noriginal, and, as I was assured, most successful weighing-machine by the\r\nLand Corporation. We found it full of very fine-looking cattle, and Mr.\r\nHutchins seems to think the operation of managing the estate as a kind\r\nof \"ranch\" decidedly promising. \"I am not a bit sorry for Mr. Dunne,\" he\r\nsaid, \"but I am very sorry for other quiet, good tenants who have been\r\ndeluded or driven into giving up valuable holdings to keep him and Mr.\r\nKilbride company, and give colour to the vapourings of Mr. William\r\nO'Brien.\"\r\n\r\nThe cases of some of these tenants were instructive. One poor man,\r\nKnowles, had gone out to America, and regularly sent home money to his\r\nfamily to pay the rent. They found other uses for it, and when the storm\r\ncame he was two years and a half in arrears. In another instance, two\r\nbrothers held contiguous holdings, and were in a manner partners. One\r\nwas fonder of Athy than of agriculture; the other a steady husbandman.\r\nFour years' arrears had grown up against the one; only a half-year's\r\ngale against the other. Clearly this difference originated outside of\r\nthe fall of prices! In a third case, a tenant wrote to Mr. Trench\r\nbegging to have something done, as he had the money to pay, and wanted\r\nto pay, but \"didn't dare.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Mr. Dunne's we drove to Mr. Kilbride's, another ample, very\r\ncomfortable house--not so thoroughly well fitted up with bathroom and\r\nother modern appurtenances as Mr. Dunne's perhaps--but still a very good\r\nhouse. It stands on a large green knoll, rather bare of trees, and\r\ncommands a fine sweep of landscape.\r\n\r\nMr. Hutchins drove me to the little road which leads up past the \"Land\r\nLeague village\" to the house of Father Maher, and there set me down.\r\n\r\nI walked up and found the curate at home--a tall, slender, well-made\r\nyoung priest, with a keen, intelligent face. He received me very\r\npolitely, and, when I showed him the card of an eminent dignitary of the\r\nChurch, with cordiality.\r\n\r\nI found him full of sympathy with the people of his parish, but neither\r\nvehement nor unfair. He did not deny that there were tenants on Lord\r\nLansdowne's estate who were amply able to pay their rents; but he did\r\nmost emphatically assert that there were not a few of them who really\r\ncould not pay their rents.\r\n\r\n\"I assure you,\" he said, \"there are some of them who cannot even pay\r\ntheir dues to their priest, and when I say that, you will know how\r\npinched and driven they must indeed be.\" It was in view of these tenants\r\nthat he seemed to justify the course of Mr. Dunne and Mr. Kilbride.\r\n\"They must all stand or fall together.\" He had nothing to say to the\r\ndiscredit of Lord Lansdowne; but he spoke with some bitterness of the\r\nagent, Mr. Townsend Trench, as having protested against Lord Lansdowne's\r\nmaking reductions here while he had himself made the same reductions on\r\nthe neighbouring estate of Mrs. Adair.\r\n\r\n\"In truth,\" he said, \"Mr. Trench has made all this trouble worse all\r\nalong. He is too much of a Napoleon\"--and with a humorous twinkle in his\r\neye as he spoke--\"too much of a Napoleon the Third.\r\n\r\n\"I was just reading his father's book when you came in. Here it is,\" and\r\nhe handed me a copy of Trench's _Realities of Irish Life_.\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever read it? This Mr. Trench, the father, was a kind of\r\nNapoleon among agents in his own time, and the son, you see, thinks it\r\nought to be understood that he is quite as great a man as his father.\r\nDid you never hear how he found a lot of his father's manuscripts once,\r\nand threw them all in the fire, calling out as he did so, 'There goes\r\nsome more of my father's vanity?'\"\r\n\r\nAbout his people, and with his people, Father Maher said he \"felt most\r\nstrongly.\" How could he help it? He was himself the son of an evicted\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, Father Maher,\" I said, \"you will understand that I wish to\r\nget at both sides of this question and of all questions here. Pray tell\r\nme then, where I shall find the story of the Luggacurren property most\r\nfully and fairly set forth in print?\"\r\n\r\nWithout a moment's hesitation he replied, \"By far the best and fairest\r\naccount of the whole matter you will get in the Irish correspondence of\r\nthe London _Times_.\"\r\n\r\nHow the conflict would end he could not say. But he was at a loss to see\r\nhow it could pay Lord Lansdowne to maintain it.\r\n\r\nHe very civilly pressed me to stay and lunch with him, but when I told\r\nhim I had already accepted an invitation from Mr. Hutchins, he very\r\nkindly bestirred himself to find my jarvey.\r\n\r\nI hastened back to the lodge, where I found a very pleasant little\r\ncompany. They were all rather astonished, I thought, by the few words I\r\nhad to say of Father Maher, and especially by his frank and sensible\r\nrecommendation of the reports in the London _Times_ as the best account\r\nI could find of the Luggacurren difficulty. To this they could not\r\ndemur, but things have got, or are getting, in Ireland, I fear, to a\r\npoint at which candour, on one side or the other of the burning\r\nquestions here debated, is regarded with at least as much suspicion as\r\nthe most deliberate misrepresentation. As to Mr. Town send Trench, what\r\nFather Maher failed to tell me, I was here told: That down to the time\r\nof the actual evictions he offered to take six months' rent from the\r\ntenants, give them a clean book, and pay all the costs. To refuse this\r\ncertainly looks like a \"war measure.\"\r\n\r\nBut for the loneliness of her life here, Mrs. Hutchins tells me she\r\nwould find it delightful. The country is exceedingly lovely in the\r\nsummer and autumn months.\r\n\r\nWhen my car came out to take me back to Athy, I found my jarvey in\r\nexcellent spirits, and quite friendly even with Mr. Hutchins himself. He\r\nkept up a running fire of lively commentaries upon the residents whose\r\nestates we passed.\r\n\r\n\"Would you think now, your honour,\" he said, pointing with his whip to\r\none large mansion standing well among good trees, \"that that's the\r\nsnuggest man there is about Athy? But he is; and it's no wonder! Would\r\nyou believe it, he never buys a newspaper, but he walks all the way into\r\nAthy, and goes about from the bank to the shops till he finds one, and\r\npicks it up and reads it. He's mighty fond of the news, but he's fonder,\r\nyou see, of a penny!\r\n\r\n\"There now, your honour, just look at that house! It's a magistrate he\r\nis that lives there; and why? Why, just to be called 'your honour,' and\r\nhave the people tip their hats to him. Oh! he delights in that, he does.\r\nWhy, you might knock a man, or put him in the water, you might, indeed,\r\nbut if you came before Mr.----, and you just called him 'your honour'\r\noften enough, and made up to him, you'd be all right! You've just to go\r\nup to him with your hat in your hand, looking up at him, and to say,\r\n'Ah! now, your honour'\" (imitating the wheedling tone to perfection),\r\n\"and indeed you'd get anything out of him--barring a sixpence, that is,\r\nor a penny!\r\n\r\n\"Ah! he's a snug one, too!\" And with that he launched a sharp thwack of\r\nthe whip at the grey mare, and we went rattling on apace.\r\n\r\nAt the very pretty station of Athy we parted the best of friends. \"Wish\r\nyou safe home, your honour.\" The kindly railway porter, also, who had\r\nrecommended Kavanagh's Hotel, was anxious to know how I found it, and so\r\nbusied himself to get me a good carriage when the train came in, that I\r\nfeel bound to exempt Athy from the judgment passed by Sir James\r\nAllport's committee against the \"amenities of railway travelling in\r\nIreland.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDUBLIN, _Saturday, March 10._--I called by appointment to-day upon Mr.\r\nBrooke, the owner of the Coolgreany estate, at his counting-house in\r\nGardiner's Row. It is one of the spacious old last-century houses of\r\nDublin; the counting-room is installed with dark, old-fashioned mahogany\r\nfittings, in what once was, and might easily again be made, a\r\ndrawing-room. Pictures hang on the walls, and the atmosphere of the\r\nwhole place is one of courtesy and culture rather than of mere modern\r\ncommerce. One of the portraits here is that of Mr. Brooke's\r\ngranduncle--a handsome, full-blooded, rather testy-looking old warrior,\r\nin the close-fitting scarlet uniform of the Prince Regent's time.\r\n\r\n\"He ought to have been called Lord Baltimore,\" said Mr. Brooke\r\ngood-naturedly; \"for he fought against your people for that city at\r\nBladensburg with Ross.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was the battle,\" I said, \"in which, according to a popular\r\ntradition in my country, the Americans took so little interest that they\r\nleft the field almost as soon as it began.\"\r\n\r\nAnother portrait is of a kinsman who was murdered in the highway here in\r\nIreland many years ago, under peculiarly atrocious circumstances, and\r\nwith no sort of provocation or excuse.\r\n\r\nMr. Brooke confirmed Dr. Dillon's statement that he had ordered out of\r\nhis counting-house two tenants who came into it with a peculiarly brazen\r\nproposition, of which I must presume Dr. Dillon was ignorant when he\r\ncited the fact as a count against the landlord of Coolgreany. I give the\r\nstory as Mr Brooke tells it. \"The Rent Audit,\" he says, \"at which my\r\ntenants were idiots enough to join the Plan of Campaign occurred about\r\nthe 12th December 1886, when, as you know, I refused to accept the terms\r\nwhich they proposed to me. I heard nothing more from them till about the\r\nmiddle of February 1887, when coming to my office one day I found two\r\ntenants waiting for me. One was Stephen Maher, a mountain man, and the\r\nother Patrick Kehoe. 'What do you want?' I asked. Whereupon they both\r\narose, and Pat Kehoe pointed to Maher. Maher fumbled at his clothes, and\r\nrubbed himself softly for a bit, and then produced a scrap of paper.\r\n'It's a bit of paper from the tenants, sir,' he said. A queer bit of\r\npaper it was to look at--ruled paper, with a composition written upon it\r\nwhich might have been the work of a village schoolmaster. It was neither\r\nsigned nor addressed! The pith of it was in these words,--'in\r\nconsequence of the manner in which we have been harassed, our cattle\r\ndriven throughout the country, and our crops not sown, we shall be\r\nunable to pay the half-year's rent due in March, in addition to the\r\nreduction already claimed!' I own I rather lost my temper at this!\r\nRemember I had already plainly refused to give 'the reduction already\r\nclaimed,' and had told them not once, but twenty times, that I would\r\nnever surrender to the 'Plan of Campaign'! I am afraid my language was\r\nPagan rather than Parliamentary--but I told them plainly, at least, that\r\nif they did not break from the Plan of Campaign, and pay their debts,\r\nthey might be sure I would turn the whole of them out! I gave them back\r\ntheir precious bit of paper and sent them packing.\r\n\r\n\"One of them, I have told you, was a mountain man, Stephen Maher. He is\r\ncommonly known among the people as 'the old fox of the mountain,' and he\r\nis very proud of it!\r\n\r\n\"This old Stephen Maher,\" said Mr. Brooke, \"is renowned in connection\r\nwith a trial for murder, at which he was summoned as a witness. When he\r\nwas cross-examined by Mr. Molloy, Q.C., he fenced and dodged about with\r\nthat distinguished counsellor for a long time, until getting vexed by\r\nthe lawyer's persistency, he exclaimed, 'Now thin, Mr. Molloy, I'd have\r\nye to know that I had a cliverer man nor iver you was, Mr. Molloy, at\r\nme, and I had to shtan' up to him for three hours before the Crowner,\r\nan' he was onable to git the throoth out of me, so he was! so he was!'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNeither did Dr. Dillon mention the fact that one of the demands made of\r\nCaptain Hamilton, Mr. Brooke's agent, in December 1886, was that a\r\nProtestant tenant named Webster should be evicted by Mr. Brooke from a\r\nfarm for which he had paid his rent, to make room for the return thither\r\nof a Roman Catholic tenant named Lenahan, previously evicted for\r\nnon-payment of his rent.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Brooke's grandfather bought the Coolgreany property in 1864, he\r\nadopted a system of betterments, which has been ever since kept up on\r\nthe estate. Nearly every tenant's house on the property has been slated,\r\nand otherwise repaired by the landlord, nor has one penny ever been\r\nadded on that account to the rents.\r\n\r\nIn the village of Coolgreany all the houses on one side of the main\r\nstreet were built in this way by the landlord, and the same thing was\r\ndone in the village of Croghan, where twenty tenants have a grazing\r\nright of three sheep for every acre held on the Croghan Mountain,\r\npronounced by the valuers of the Land Court to be one of the best\r\ngrazing mountains in Ireland.\r\n\r\nCaptain Hamilton became the agent of the property in 1879, on the death\r\nof Mr. Vesey. One of his earliest acts was to advise Mr. Brooke to grant\r\nan abatement of 25 per cent. in June 1881, while the Land Act was\r\npassing. At the same time, he cautioned the tenants that this was only a\r\ntemporary reduction, and advised them to get judicial rents fixed.\r\n\r\nThe League advised them not to do this, but to demand 25 per cent.\r\nreduction again in December 1881. This demand was rejected, and forty\r\nwrits were issued. The tenants thereupon in January 1882 came in and\r\npaid the full rent, with the costs.\r\n\r\nEleven tenants after this went into Court, and in 1883 the\r\nSub-Commissioners cut down their rents. In five cases Mr. Brooke\r\nappealed. What was the result before the Chief Commissioner? The rent of\r\nMary Green, which had been £43, and had been cut down by the\r\nSub-Commissioners to £39, was restored to £43; the rent of Mr. Kavanagh,\r\ncut down from £57 to £52, was restored to £55; the rent of Pat Kehoe\r\n(one of the two tenants \"ejected\" from Mr. Brooke's office as already\r\nstated), cut down from £81 to £70, was restored to £81; the rent of\r\nGraham, cut down from £38 to £32, 10s., was restored to £38. Other\r\nreductions were maintained.\r\n\r\nThis appears to be the record of \"rack-renting\" on the Coolgreany\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nThere are 114 tenants, of whom 15 hold under judicial rents; 22 are\r\nleaseholders, and 77 are non-judicial yearly tenants. There are 12\r\nProtestants holding in all a little more than 1200 acres. All the rest\r\nare Catholics, 14 of these being cottier tenants. The estate consists of\r\n5165 acres. The average is about £24, and the average rental about £26,\r\n10s. The gross rental is £2614, of which £1000 go to the jointure of Mr.\r\nBrooke's mother, and £800 are absorbed by the tithe charges, half\r\npoor-rates and other taxes. During the year 1886, in which this war was\r\ndeclared against him, Mr. Brooke spent £714 in improvements upon the\r\nproperty: so in that year his income from Coolgreany was practically\r\n_nil_.\r\n\r\nWhat in these circumstances would have been the position of this\r\nlandlord had he not possessed ample means not invested in this\r\nparticular estate? And what has been the result to the tenants of this\r\nconflict into which it seems clear that they were led, less to protect\r\nany direct interest of their own than to jeopardise their homes and\r\ntheir livelihood for the promotion of a general agrarian agitation? It\r\nis not clear that they are absolutely so far out of pocket, for I find\r\nthat the Post-Office Savings Bank deposits at Inch and Gorey rose from\r\n£3699, 5s. 4d. in 1880 to £5308, 13s. in 1887, showing an increase of\r\n£1609, 7s. 8d. But they are out of house and home and work, entered\r\npupils in that school of idleness and iniquity which has been kept by\r\none Preceptor from the beginning of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.[25]\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * *--Mrs. Kavanagh was quite right when she told me at Borris in\r\nMarch that this country should be seen in June! The drive to this lovely\r\nplace this morning was one long enchantment of verdure and hawthorn\r\nblossoms and fragrance.\r\n\r\nI came over from London to bring to a head some inquiries which have too\r\nlong delayed the publication of this diary. My intention had been to go\r\ndirectly to Thurles, but a telegram which I received from the Archbishop\r\nof Cashel just before I left telling me that he could not be at home for\r\nthe last three days of the week, I came directly here. Nothing can be\r\nmore utterly unlike the popular notions of Ireland and of Irish life\r\nthan the aspect of this most smiling and beautiful region: nothing more\r\nthoroughly Irish than its people.\r\n\r\n* * * who is one of the most active and energetic of Irish landlords,\r\nlives part of the year abroad, but keeps up his Irish property with\r\ncare, at the expense, I suspect, of his estates elsewhere.\r\n\r\nFrom a noble avenue of trees, making the highway like the main road of a\r\nprivate park, we turned into a literal paradise of gardens. The air was\r\nbalmy with their wealth of odours. \"Oh! yes, sir,\" said the coachman,\r\nwith an air of sympathetic pride, \"our lady is just the greatest lady in\r\nall this land for flowers!\"\r\n\r\nAnd for ivy, he might have added. We drove between green walls of ivy up\r\nto a house which seemed itself to be built of ivy, like that wonderful\r\nold mansion of Castle Leod in Scotland. Here, plainly, is another centre\r\nof \"sweetness and light,\" the abolition of which must make, not this\r\nregion alone, but Ireland poorer in that precise form of wealth, which,\r\nas Laboulaye has shown in one of the best of his lectures, is absolutely\r\nidentical with civilisation. It is such places as this, which, in the\r\ninterest of the people, justify the exemption from redistribution and\r\nresettlement, made in one of a series of remarkable articles on Ireland\r\nrecently published in the _Birmingham Post_, of lands, the \"breaking up\r\nof which would interfere with the amenity of a residence.\"\r\n\r\n* * * relations with all classes of the people here are so cordial and\r\nstraightforward that he has been easily able to give me to-day, what I\r\nhave sought in vain elsewhere in Ireland, an opportunity of conversing\r\nfrankly and freely with several labouring men. For obvious reasons these\r\nmen, as a rule, shrink from any expression of their real feelings. Their\r\nposition is apparently one of absolute dependence either upon the\r\nfarmers or the landlords, there being no other local market for their\r\nlabour, which is their only stock-in-trade. As one of them said to me\r\nto-day, \"The farmers will work a man just as long as they can't help it,\r\nand then they throw him away.\"\r\n\r\nI asked if there were no regular farm-labourers hired at fixed rates by\r\nthe year?\r\n\r\n\"Oh! very few--less now than ever; and there'll be fewer before there'll\r\nbe more. The farmers don't want to pay the labourers or to pay the\r\nlandlords; they want the land and the work for nothing, sir,--they do\r\nindeed!\"\r\n\r\n\"What does a farm-hand get,\" I asked, \"if he is hired for a long time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, permanent men, they'll get 6s. a week with breakfast and dinner,\r\nor 7s. maybe, with one meal; and a servant-boy, sir, he'll get 2s. a\r\nweek or may be 3s. with his board; but it's seldom he gets it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what has he for his board?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, stirabout; and then twice a week coorse Russian or American meat,\r\nwhat they call the 'kitchen,' and they like it better than good meat,\r\nsir, because it feeds the pot more.\"\r\n\r\nBy this I found he meant that the \"coorse meat\" gave out more\r\n\"unctuosity\" in the boiling--the meat being always served up boiled in a\r\npot with vegetables, like the \"bacon and greens\" of the \"crackers\" in\r\nthe South.\r\n\r\n\"And nothing else?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; buttermilk and potatoes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And these wages are the highest?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I know a boy got 5s., but by living in his father's house, and\r\nworking out it was he got it. And then they go over to England to work.\"\r\n\r\n\"What wages do they get there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it differs, but they do well; 9s. a week, I think, and their board,\r\nand straw to sleep on in the stables.\"\r\n\r\n\"But doesn't it cost them a good deal to go and come?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no; they get cheap rates. They send them from Galway to Dublin like\r\ncattle, at £2, 5s. a car, and that makes about 1s. 6d. a head; and then\r\nthey are taken over on the steamers very cheap. Often the graziers that\r\ndo large business with the companies, will have a right to send over a\r\nnumber of men free; and they stowaway too; and then on the railways in\r\nEngland they get passes free often from cattle-dealers, specially when\r\nthey are coming back, and the dealers don't want their passes. They do\r\nvery well. They'll bring back £7 and £10. I was on a boat once, and\r\nthere was a man; he was drunk; he was from Galway somewhere, and they\r\ntook away and kept for him £18, all in good golden sovereigns; that was\r\nthe most I ever saw. And he was drunk, or who'd ever have known he had\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do the farmers build houses for the labourers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Build houses, is it! Glory be to God! who ever heard of such a thing?\r\nThe farmers are a poor proud lot. They'd let a labourer die in the\r\nditch!\"\r\n\r\nAll that this poor man said was corroborated by another man of a higher\r\nclass, very familiar with the conditions of life and labour here, and\r\nindeed one of the most interesting men I have met in Ireland. Born the\r\nson of a labouring man, he was educated by a priest and educated\r\nhimself, till he fitted himself for the charge of a small school, which\r\nhe kept to such good purpose that in eighteen years he saved £1100, with\r\nwhich capital he resolved to begin life as a small farmer and\r\nshopkeeper. He had studied all the agricultural works he could get, and\r\nbefore he went fairly into the business, he travelled on the Continent,\r\nlooking carefully into the methods of culture and manner of life of the\r\npeople, especially in Italy and in Belgium. The Belgian farming gave him\r\nnew ideas of what might be done in Ireland, and those ideas he has put\r\ninto practice, with the best results.\r\n\r\n\"On the same land with my neighbours,\" he said, \"I double their\r\nproduction. Where they get two tons of hay I get four or four and a\r\nhalf, where they get forty-five barrels of potatoes I get a hundred.\r\nOnly the other day I got £20 for a bullock I had taken pains with to\r\nfatten him up scientifically. Of course I had a small capital to start\r\nwith: but where did I get that? Not from the Government. I earned and\r\nsaved it myself; and then I wasn't above learning how best to use it.\"\r\n\r\nHe thinks the people here--though by no means what they might be with\r\nmore thrift and knowledge--much better off than the same class in many\r\nother parts of Ireland. There are no \"Gombeen men\" here, he says, and no\r\nusurious shopkeepers. \"The people back each other in a friendly way when\r\nthey need help.\" Many of the labourers, he says, are in debt to him, but\r\nhe never presses them, and they are very patient with each other. They\r\nwould do much better if any pains were taken to teach them. It is his\r\nbelief that agricultural schools and model farms would do more than\r\nalmost any measure that could be devised for bringing up the standard of\r\ncomfort and prosperity here, and making the country quiet.\r\n\r\nIt is the opinion of this man that the people of this place have been\r\nled to regard the Papal Decree as a kind of attack on their liberties,\r\nand that they are quite as likely to resist as to obey it. For his own\r\npart, he thinks Ireland ought to have her own parliament, and make her\r\nown laws. He is not satisfied with the laws actually made, though he\r\nadmits they are better than the older laws were. \"The tenants get their\r\nown improvements now,\" he said, \"and in old times the more a man\r\nimproved the worse it was for him, the agent all the while putting up\r\nthe rents.\"\r\n\r\nBut he does not want Irish independence. \"The people that talk that\r\nway,\" he said, \"have never travelled. They don't see how idle it is for\r\nIreland to talk about supporting herself. She just can't do it.\"\r\n\r\nNot less interesting was my talk to-day with quite a different person.\r\nThis was a keen-eyed, hawk-billed, wiry veteran of the '48. As a youth\r\nhe had been out with \"Meagher of the Sword,\" and his eyes glowed when he\r\nfound that I had known that champion of Erin. \"I was out at Ballinagar,\"\r\nhe said; \"there were five hundred men with guns, and five hundred\r\npikemen.\" It struck me he would like to be going \"out\" again in the same\r\nfashion, but he had little respect for the \"Nationalists.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's too many lawyers among them,\" he said, \"too many lawyers and\r\ntoo many dealers. The lawyers are doing well, thanks to the League. Oh\r\nyes!\" with a knowing chuckle, and a light of mischief in his eye; \"the\r\nlawyers are doing very well! There's one little bit of a solicitor not\r\nfar from here was of no good at all four years ago, and now they tell me\r\nhe's made four thousand pounds in three years' time, good money, and got\r\nit all in hand! And there's another, I hear, has made six thousand. The\r\nlawyers that call themselves Nationalists, they just keep mischief\r\nagoing to further themselves. What do they care for the labourers? Why,\r\nno more than the farmers do--and what would become of the poor men! * *\r\n* * here, he is making * * * * * * * and he keeps more poor men going\r\nthan all the lawyers and all the farmers in the place a good part of the\r\nyear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are the labourers,\" I asked, \"Nationalists?\"\r\n\r\n\"They don't know what they are,\" he answered. \"They hate the farmers,\r\nbut they love Ireland, and they all stand together for the counthry!\"\r\n\r\n\"How is it with the Plan of Campaign and the Boycotting?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now what use have the labourers got for the Plan of Campaign? No more\r\nthan for the moon! And for the Boycotting, I never liked it--but I was\r\nnever afraid of it--and there's not been much of it here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will the Papal Decree put a stop to what there is of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't mind the Pope's Decree no more than that door!\" he exclaimed\r\nindignantly. \"Hasn't he enough, sure, to mind in Rome? Why didn't he\r\ndefend his own country, not bothering about Ireland!\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you not a Catholic, then?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, I'm a Catholic, but I wouldn't mind the Decree. Only remember,\"\r\nhe added, after a pause, \"just this: it don't trouble me, for I've\r\nnothing to do with the Plan of Campaign--only I don't want the Pope to\r\nbe meddlin' in matters that don't concern him.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's out of respect, then, for the Pope that you wouldn't mind the\r\nDecree?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just that, intirely! It was some of them Englishmen wheedled it out of\r\nhim, you may be sure, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am told you went out to America once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I went there in '48, and I came back in '51.\"\r\n\r\n\"What made you go?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Is it what made me go?\" he replied, with a sudden fierceness in his\r\nvoice. \"It was the evictions made me go; that we was put out of the good\r\nholding my father had, and his father before him; and I can never\r\nforgive it, never! But I came back; and it was * * * father that was the\r\ngood man to me and to mine, else where would I be?\"\r\n\r\nI afterwards learned from * * * * that the evictions of which the old\r\nman spoke with so much bitterness were made in carrying out important\r\nimprovements, and that it was quite true that his father had greatly\r\nbefriended the emigrant when he got enough of the New World and came\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nIt was curious to see the old grudge fresh and fierce in the old man's\r\nheart, but side by side with it the lion lying down with the lamb--a\r\nwarm and genuine recognition of the kindness and help bestowed on\r\nhimself. His resentment against the landlord's action in one generation\r\ndid not in the least interfere with his recognition of the landlord's\r\nusefulness and liberality in the next generation.\r\n\r\n\"You didn't like America?\" I said. \"Where did you live there?\"\r\n\r\n\"I lived at North Brookfield in Massachusetts, a year or two,\" he\r\nreplied, \"with Governor Amasa Walker. Did you know him? He was a good\r\nman; he was fond of the people, but he thought too much of the nagurs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I answered; \"I know all about him, and he was, as you say, a very\r\ngood man, even if he was an abolitionist. But why didn't you stay in\r\nNorth Brookfield?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it was a poor country indeed! A blast of wind would blow all the\r\nground away there was! It does no good to the people, going to America,\"\r\nhe said; \"they come back worse than they went!\"\r\n\r\nHe is at work now in some quarries here.\r\n\r\n\"The quarrymen get six shillings a week,\" he said, \"with bread and tea\r\nand butter and meat three times a week. With nine shillings a week and\r\nboard, a man'll make himself bigger than * * *!\"\r\n\r\n\"Was the country quiet now?\"\r\n\r\n\"This country here? Oh! it's very quiet; with potatoes at 3s. 6d. a\r\nbarrel, it's a good year for the people. They're a very quiet\r\npeople,\"--in corroboration apparently of which statement he told me a\r\nstory of a coroner's jury called to sit on the body of a man found on\r\nthe highway shot through the head, which returned an unanimous verdict\r\nof \"Died by the visitation of God.\"\r\n\r\nThis country is dominated by the Rocky Hills climbing up to Cullenagh,\r\nwhich divides the Barrow valley from the Nore. We drove this afternoon\r\nto * a most lovely place. The mansion there is now shut up and\r\ndismantled, but the park and the grounds are very beautiful, with a\r\nbeauty rather enhanced than diminished by the somewhat unkempt\r\nluxuriance of the vegetation. We passed a now well-grown tree planted by\r\nthe Prince of Wales * * * * * * and drove over many miles of excellent\r\nroad made by * * * * * * * * employs * * * * * * * * regularly, * * *\r\nmen as labourers, cartmen and masons, to whom he pays out annually the\r\nsum of * * Mr. * * who, by the way, rather resented my asking him if he\r\ncame of one of the Cromwellian English families so numerous here, and\r\ninformed me that his people came over with Strongbow--assures me that\r\nbut for these works of * * * * these men under him would be literally\r\nwithout occupation. In addition to these there are about a dozen more\r\nmen employed * * as gamekeepers and plantation-men. At the * * places\r\nbelonging to * * * * * * * * * * above eighty men find constant\r\nemployment, and receive regular wages amounting to over £4000. Were * *\r\n* * dispossessed or driven out of Ireland, all this outlay would come to\r\nan end, and with what result to these working-men? As things now are,\r\nwhile * * * working-men receive a regular wage of five shillings, the\r\nsame men, as farmers' labourers, would receive, now and then, five\r\nshillings a week, and that without food! I saw enough in the course of\r\nour afternoon's drive to satisfy me that my informant of the morning had\r\nprobably not overstated matters when he told me that for at least\r\nseventy per cent. of the work done by the labourers here, from November\r\nto May, they have to look to the landlords. On the property of * * as\r\nwell as on the neighbouring properties * * * * * * * the houses have\r\nbeen generally put up by the landlords. We called in the course of the\r\nafternoon upon a labouring man who lives with his wife in a very neat,\r\ncozy, and quite new house, built recently for him by * *. These good\r\npeople have been living on this property for now nearly half a century.\r\nTheir new house having been built for them, * * has had an agreement\r\nprepared, under which it may be secured to them. The terms have all been\r\ndiscussed and found satisfactory, but the old labourer now hesitates\r\nabout signing the agreement. He gives, and can be got to give, no reason\r\nfor this; but when we drove up he came out to greet us in the most\r\nfriendly manner. We went in and found his wife, a shrewd, sharp-eyed,\r\nlittle old dame, with whom * * * * fell into a confabulation, while I\r\nwent into the next room with the labourer himself. The house was neatly\r\nfurnished--with little ornaments and photographs on the mantel-shelf,\r\nand nothing of the happy-go-lucky look so common about the houses of the\r\nworking people in Ireland, as well as about the houses of the lesser\r\nsquires.\r\n\r\nI paid him a compliment on the appearance of his house and grounds.\r\n\"Yes, sir!\" he answered: \"it's a very good place it is, and * * * * has\r\nbuilt it just to please us.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I am told you want to leave it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, no, that is not so, sir, indeed at all! We've three children you\r\nsee, sir, in America--two girls and a boy we have.\"\r\n\r\n\"And where are they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, the girls they're not in any factory at all. They're like leddies,\r\nliving out in a place they call * * in Massachusetts; and the lad, he\r\nwas on a farm there. But we don't know where he is nor his sisters any\r\nmore just now. And the wife, she thinks she would like to go out to\r\nAmerica and see the children.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you hear from them regularly?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's only a few pounds they send, but they're doing very well.\r\nDomestics they are, quite like leddies; there's their pictures on the\r\nshelf.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what would you do there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! we'd have lodgings, the wife says, sir. But I like the ould place\r\nmyself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you are quite right there,\" I replied. \"And do you get work\r\nhere from the farmers as the labourers do in my country?\"\r\n\r\n\"Work from the farmers, sir?\" he answered, rather sharply. \"What they\r\ncan't help we get, but no more! If the farmers in America is like them,\r\nit's not I would be going there! The farmers! For the farmers, a\r\nlabourer, sir, is not of the race of Adam! They think any place good\r\nenough for a labourer--any place and any food! Is the farmers that way\r\nin America?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't know that they are so very much more liberal than your\r\nfarmers are,\" I replied; \"but I think they'd have to treat you as being\r\nof the race of Adam! But are not the farmers here, or the Guardians,\r\nobliged to build houses for the labourers? I thought there was an Act of\r\nParliament about that?\"\r\n\r\n\"And so there is but what's the good of it? It's just to get the\r\nlabourers' votes, and then they fool the labourers, just making them\r\nquarrel about where the cottages shall be, what they call the 'sites';\r\nand then there's no cottages built at all, at all. It's the lawyers, you\r\nsee, sir, gets in with the farmers--the strongest farmers--and then they\r\njust make fools of the labourers as if there was no Act of Parliament at\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if the labourers want to go away, to emigrate,\" I said, \"as you\r\nwant to do, to America, don't the farmers, or the Government, or the\r\nlandlords, help them to get away and make a start?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit of it, sir,\" he replied; \"not a bit of it. I believe,\r\nthough,\" he added after a moment; \"I believe they do get some help to go\r\nto Australia. But they're mostly no good that goes that way. The best is\r\nthem that go for themselves, or their friends help them. But there's not\r\nso many going this year.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we drove away I asked * * if he had made any progress towards a\r\nsignature of the agreement with the labourer's wife.\r\n\r\n\"No; she couldn't be got to say yes or no. I asked her,\" said * * \"what\r\nreason they had for imagining that after all these years I would try to\r\ndo them an injury? She protested they never thought of such a thing; but\r\nshe couldn't be brought to say she wished her husband to sign the paper.\r\nIt's very odd, indeed.\"\r\n\r\nI couldn't help suspecting that the _materfamilias_ was at the bottom of\r\nit all, and that she was bent upon going out to America to participate\r\nin the prosperity of her two daughters, who were living \"like leddies\"\r\nat * * in Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nThe incident recalled to me something which happened years ago when I\r\nwas returning with the Storys from Rome to Boston. Our Cunarder, in the\r\nmiddle of the night, off the Irish coast, ran down and instantly sank a\r\nsmall schooner.\r\n\r\nIn a wonderfully short time we had come-to, and a boat's crew had\r\nsucceeded in picking up and bringing all the poor people on board. Among\r\nthem was a wizened old woman, upon whom all sorts of kind attentions\r\nwere naturally lavished by the ship's company. She could not be\r\npersuaded to go into a cabin after she had recovered from the shock and\r\nthe fright of the accident, but, comforted and clothed with new and dry\r\ngarments, she took refuge under one of the companion-ways, and there,\r\nsitting huddled up, with her arms about her knees, she crooned and\r\nmoaned to herself, \"I was near being in a wetter and a warmer place; I\r\nwas near being in a wetter and a warmer place!\" by the half hour\r\ntogether. We found that the poor old soul had been to Liverpool to see\r\nher son off on a sailing ship as an emigrant to America. So a\r\nsubscription was soon made up to send her on our arrival to New York\r\nthere to await her son. We had some trouble in making her understand\r\nwhat was to be done with her, but when she finally got it fairly into\r\nher head, gleams of mingled surprise and delight came over her withered\r\nface, and she finally broke out, \"Oh, then, glory be to God! it's a\r\nmercy that I was drownded! glory be to God! and it's the proud boy\r\nTerence will be when he gets out to America to find his poor ould mother\r\nwaiting for him there that he left behind him in Liverpool, and quite\r\nthe leddy with all this good gold money in her hand, glory be to God!\"\r\n\r\nOn our way back to * * we passed through * * a very neat\r\nprosperous-looking town, which * * tells me is growing up on the heels\r\nof * *. * * * was one of the few places at which the \"no rent\"\r\nmanifesto, issued by Mr. Parnell and his colleagues from their prison in\r\nKilmainham, during the confinement of Mr. Davitt at Portland, and\r\nwithout concert with him, was taken up by a village curate and commended\r\nto the people. He was arrested for it by Mr. Gladstone's Government, and\r\nlocked up for six weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUBLIN, _Saturday, June 23d._--I left * * * yesterday morning early on\r\nan \"outside car,\" with one of my fellow-guests in that \"bower of\r\nbeauty,\" who was bent on killing a salmon somewhere in the Nore * * We\r\ndrove through a most varied and picturesque country, viewing on the way\r\nthe seats of Mr. Hamilton Stubber and Mr. Robert Staples, both finely\r\nsituated in well-wooded parks. Mr. Stubber was formerly master of the\r\nQueen's County hounds, a famous pack, which, as our jarvey put it,\r\n\"brought a power of money into the county, and made it aisy for a poor\r\nman.\" But the local agitations wore out his patience, and he put the\r\npack down some years ago. Not far from his house is an astonishing\r\nmodern \"tumulus,\" or mound of hewn and squared stones. These it seems\r\nwere quarried and brought here by him, with the intention of building a\r\nnew and handsome residence. This intention he abandoned under the same\r\nannoyance.\r\n\r\n\"They call it Mr. Stubber's Cairn,\" said the jarvey; \"and a sorrowful\r\nsight it is, to think of the work it would have given the people,\r\nbuilding the big house that'll never be built now, I'm thinking.\" If Mr.\r\nStubber should become an \"absentee,\" he can hardly, I think, be blamed\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nHis property marches with that of Mr. Robert Staples, who comes of a\r\nGloucestershire family planted in Ireland under Charles I.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Staples is farming his own lands,\" said our jarvey, when I\r\ncommented on the fine appearance of some fields as we drove by; \"and\r\nhe'll be doing very well this year. Ah! he comes and goes, but he's here\r\na great deal, and he looks after everything himself; that's the reason\r\nthe fields is good.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a property of some 1500 statute acres. Only last March the\r\nlandlord took over from one tenant, who was in arrears of two years and\r\na half and owed him some £300, a farm of 90 acres, giving the man fifty\r\npounds to boot, and bidding him go in peace. I wonder whether this\r\nproceeding would make the landlord a \"land-grabber,\" and expose him to\r\nthe pains and penalties of \"boycotting\"?\r\n\r\nOn this place, too, it seems that Mr. Staples's grandfather put up many\r\nhouses for the tenants; a thing worth noting, as one of not a few\r\ninstances I have come upon to show that it will not do to accept without\r\nexamination the sweeping statements so familiar to us in America, that\r\nimprovements have never been made by the landlord upon Irish estates.\r\n\r\nMy companion had meant to put me down at the railway station of\r\nAttanagh, there to catch a good train to Kilkenny.\r\n\r\nBut we had a capital nag, and reached Attanagh so early that we\r\ndetermined to drive on to Ballyragget.\r\n\r\nFrom Attanagh to Ballyragget the road ran along a plateau which\r\ncommanded the most beautiful views of the valley of the Nore and of the\r\nfinely wooded country beyond. Ballyragget itself is a brisk little\r\nmarket town, the American influence showing itself here, as in so many\r\nother places, in such trifles as the signs on the shops which describe\r\nthem as \"stores.\" My salmon-fishing companion put me down at the station\r\nand went off to the river, which flows through the town, and is here a\r\nswift and not inconsiderable stream.\r\n\r\nAn hour in the train took me to Kilkenny, where I met by appointment\r\nseveral persons whom I had been unable to see during my previous visit\r\nin March.\r\n\r\nThese gentlemen, experienced agents, gave me a good deal of information\r\nas to the effect of the present state of things upon the \"_moral_\" of\r\nthe tenantry in different parts of Ireland. On one estate, for example,\r\nin the county of Longford, a tenant has been doing battle for the cause\r\nof Ireland in the following extraordinary fashion.\r\n\r\nHe held certain lands at a rental of £23, 4s. Being, to use the\r\npicturesque language of the agent, a \"little good for tenant,\" he fell\r\ninto arrears, and on the 1st of May 1885 owed nearly three years' rent,\r\nor £63, 12s., in addition to a sum of £150 which he had borrowed of his\r\namiable landlord three or four years before to enable him to work his\r\nfarm. Of this total sum of £213, 12s. he positively refused to pay one\r\npenny. Proceedings were accordingly taken against him, and he was\r\nevicted. By this eviction his title to the tenancy was broken. The\r\nlandlord nevertheless, for the sake of peace and quiet, offered to allow\r\nhim to sell, to a man who wished to take the place, any interest he\r\nmight have had in the holding, and to forgive both the arrears of the\r\nrent and the £150 which had been borrowed by him. The ex-tenant flatly\r\nrefused to accept this offer, became a weekly pensioner upon the\r\nNational League, and declared war. The landlord was forced to get a\r\ncaretaker for the place from the Property Defence Association at a cost\r\nof £1 per week, to provide a house for a police protection party, and to\r\ndefray the expenses of that party upon fuel and lights. Nor was this\r\nall. The landlord found himself further obliged to employ men from the\r\nsame Property Defence Association to cut and save the hay-crop on the\r\nland, and when this had been done no one could be found to buy the crop.\r\nThe crop and the lands were \"boycotted.\" It was only in May last that a\r\npurchaser could be found for the hay cut and saved two years ago--this\r\npurchaser being himself a \"boycotted\" man on an adjoining property. He\r\nbought the hay, paying for it a price which did not quite cover one-half\r\nthe cost of sowing it!\r\n\r\n\"No one denies for a moment,\" said the agent, \"that the tenant in all\r\nthis business has been more than fairly, even generously, treated by the\r\nestate; yet no one seems to think it anything but natural and reasonable\r\nthat he should demand, as he now demands, to be put back into the\r\npossession of his forfeited tenancy at a certain rent fixed by himself,\"\r\nwhich he will obligingly agree to pay, \"provided that the hay cut and\r\nsaved on the property two years ago is accounted for to him by the\r\nestate!\"\r\n\r\nIn another case an agent, Mr. Ivough, had to deal with a body of five\r\nhundred tenants on a considerable estate. Of these tenants, two hundred\r\nsettled their rents with the landlord before the passing of the Land Act\r\nof 1881, and valuations made by the landlord's valuer, with their full\r\nassent. There was no business for the lawyers, so far as they were\r\nconcerned, and no compulsion of any sort was put on them. Among them was\r\na man who had married the daughter of an old tenant on the estate, and\r\nso came into a holding of 12 Irish, or more than 20 statute, acres, at a\r\nrental of £18 a year. The valuer reduced this to £14, 10s., which\r\nsatisfied the tenant, and as the agent agreed to make this reduced\r\nvaluation retroactive, all went as smoothly as possible for two years,\r\nwhen the tenant began to fall into arrears. When the Sub-Commissioners,\r\nbetween 1885 and 1887, took to making sweeping reductions, the tenants\r\nwho had settled freely under the recent valuation grumbled bitterly. As\r\none of them tersely put it to the agent, \"We were a parcel of bloody\r\nfools, and you ought to have told us these Sub-Commissioners were\r\ncoming!\" Mr. Sweeney, the tenant by marriage already mentioned, was not\r\ncontent to express his particular dissatisfaction in idle words, but\r\nkept on going into arrears. In May 1888 things came to a crisis. The\r\nagent refused to accept a settlement which included the payment by him\r\nof the costs of the proceedings forced upon him by his tenant. \"You have\r\nhad a good holding,\" said the agent, \"with plenty of water and good\r\nland. In this current year two acres of your wheat will pay the whole\r\nrent. You have broken up and sold bit by bit a mill that was on the\r\nplace; and above all, when Mr. Gladstone made us accept the judicial\r\nrents, he told us we might be sure, if we did this, of punctual payment.\r\nThat was the one consideration held out to us. And we are entitled to\r\nthat!\"\r\n\r\nThe tenant being out of his holding, the agent wishes to put another\r\ntenant into it. But the holding is \"boycotted.\" Several tenants are\r\nanxious for it, and would gladly take it, but they dare not The great\r\nevicted will neither sell any tenant-right he may have, nor pay his\r\narrears and costs, nor give up the place to another tenant. To put\r\nProperty Defence men on the holding would cost the landlord £2, 10s. a\r\nweek, and do him no great good, as the evicted man \"holds the fort,\"\r\nbeing established in a house which he occupies on an adjoining property,\r\nand for which presumably he pays his rent. It seems as if Mr. Sweeney\r\nwere inspired by the example of another tenant, named Barry, who, before\r\nthe passing of the Land Act of 1881, gave up freely a holding of 20\r\nacres, on a property managed by Mr. Kough; but as he was on such good\r\nterms with the agent that he could borrow money of him, he begged the\r\nagent to let him retain at a low rent a piece of this surrendered land\r\ndirectly adjoining his house. He asked this in the name of his eight or\r\nnine children, and it was granted him. The agent afterwards found that\r\nthe piece of land in question was by far the best of the surrendered\r\nholding. But that is a mere detail. This ingenious tenant Barry, living\r\nnow on another estate just outside the grasp of the agent, has\r\nsystematically \"boycotted\" for the last nine years the land which he\r\ngave up, feeding his own cattle upon it freely meanwhile, and keeping\r\nall would-be tenants at a distance! \"He is now,\" said the agent, \"quite\r\na wealthy man in his way, jobbing cattle at all the great markets!\"\r\n\r\n\"When the eviction of Sweeney took place,\" said the agent, \"I was\r\npresent in person, as I thought I ought to be, and the result is that I\r\nhave been held up to the execration of mankind as a monster for putting\r\nout a child in a cradle into a storm. As a matter of fact,\" he said,\r\n\"there was a cradle in the way, which the sheriff-Officer gently took\r\nup, and by direction of the tenant's wife removed. I made no remark\r\nabout it at all, but a local paper published a lying story, which the\r\npublisher had to retract, that I had said 'Throw out the child!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Two priests,\" he said, \"came quite uninvited and certainly without\r\nprovocation, to see me, and one of them shouted out, 'Ah! we know you'll\r\nbe making another Coolgreany,' which was as much as to say there 'would\r\nbe bloodshed.' This was the more intolerable,\" he added, \"that, as I\r\nafterwards found, I had already done for the sake of the tenants\r\nprecisely what these ecclesiastics professed that they had come to ask\r\nme to do!\r\n\r\n\"For thirty years,\" said this gentleman, \"I have lived in the midst of\r\nthese people--and in all that time I have never had so much as a\r\nthreatening letter. But after this story was published of my throwing\r\nout a cradle with a child in it, I was insulted in the street by a woman\r\nwhom I had never seen before. Two girls, too, called out at the\r\neviction, 'You've bad pluck; why didn't you tell us you were coming down\r\nthe day?' and another woman made me laugh by crying after me, 'You've\r\ntwo good-looking daughters, but you're a bad man yourself.'\"\r\n\r\nQuite as instructive is the story given me on this occasion of the\r\nTyaquin estate in the county of Galway. This estate is managed by an\r\nagent, Mr. Eichardson of Castle Coiner, in this county of Kilkenny.\r\n\r\nThe rents on this Galway estate, as Mr. Richardson assures me, have been\r\nunaltered for between thirty and forty years, and some of them for even\r\na longer period. For the last twenty-five years certainty, during which\r\nMr. Richardson has been the agent of the estate, and probably, he\r\nthinks, for many years previous, there has never been a case of the\r\nnon-payment of rent, except in recent years when rents were withheld for\r\na time for political reasons.\r\n\r\nLarge sums of money have been laid out in various useful improvements.\r\nConstant occupation was given to those requiring it, until the agrarian\r\nagitation became fully developed. On the demesne and the home farms the\r\nbest systems of reclaiming waste lands and the best systems of\r\nagriculture were practically exhibited, so that the estate was an\r\nagricultural free school for all who cared to learn.\r\n\r\nWhen the Land Act of 1881 was passed, almost all the tenants applied,\r\nand had judicial rents fixed, many of them by consent of the agent.\r\n\r\nIn 1887 the tenants were called on as usual to pay these judicial rents.\r\nA large minority refused to do so except on certain terms, which were\r\nrefused. The dispute continued for many months, but as the charges on\r\nthe estate had to be met, the agent was obliged to give way, and allow\r\nan abatement of four shillings in the pound on these judicial rents.\r\nSome of these charges, to meet which the agent gave way, were for money\r\nborrowed from the Commissioners of Public Works to _improve the holdings\r\nof the tenants_. For these improvements thus thrown entirely upon the\r\nfunds of the estate no increase of rent or charge of any kind had been\r\nlaid upon the tenants.\r\n\r\nWhen a settlement was agreed on, those of the tenants who had adopted\r\nthe Plan came in a body to pay their rents on 3d January 1888. They\r\nstated that they were unable to pay more than the rent due up to\r\nNovember 1886, and that they would never have adopted the Plan had they\r\nnot been driven into it by _sheer distress_. After which they handed Mr.\r\nRichardson a cheque drawn by John T. Dillon, Esq., M.P., for the amount\r\nbanked with the National League.\r\n\r\nAn article appeared shortly afterwards in a League newspaper, loudly\r\nboasting of the great victory won by Mr. Dillon, M.P., for the starving\r\nand poverty-stricken tenants. Two of these tenants (brothers) were under\r\na yearly rent of £7, 10s. They declared they could only pay £3, 15s., or\r\na half-year's rent, and this only if they got an abatement of 15s. Yet\r\nthese same tenants were then paying Mr. Richardson £50 a year for a\r\ngrass farm, and about £12 for meadows, as well as £30 a year more for a\r\ngrass farm to an adjoining landlord.\r\n\r\nAnother tenant who held a farm at £13, 5s. a year declared he could only\r\npay £6, 12s. 6d., or a half-year's rent, if he got an abatement of £1,\r\n6s. 6d. A very short time before, this tenant had taken a grass farm\r\nfrom an adjoining landlord, and he was so anxious to get it that he\r\nshowed the landlord a bundle of large notes, amounting to rather more\r\nthan £300 sterling, in order to prove his solvency! The same tenant has\r\nsince written a letter to Mr. Richardson offering £50 a year for a grass\r\nfarm!\r\n\r\nAll these campaigners, Mr. Richardson says, \"with one noble exception,\r\nthe wife of a tenant who was ill, declined to pay a penny of rent beyond\r\nNovember 1st, 1886,\" stating that they were \"absolutely unable\" to do\r\nmore. So they all left the May 1887 rent unpaid, and the hanging gale to\r\nNovember 1887, which, however, they were not even asked to pay.\r\n\r\nThe morning after the settlement many of the tenants who, when they were\r\nall present in a body on the previous evening, had declared their\r\n\"inability\" to pay the half-year's rent due down to May 1887,\r\nindividually came to Mr. Richardson unasked, and paid it, some saying\r\nthey had \"borrowed the money that night,\" but others frankly declaring\r\nthat they dared not break the rule publicly, having been ordered by the\r\nLeague only to pay to November 1886, for fear of the consequences. These\r\nwould have been injury to their cattle, or the burning of their hay, or\r\npossibly murder.\r\n\r\nOf the country about Kilkenny, I am told, as of the country about\r\nCarlow, that nearly or quite seventy per cent, of the labourers are\r\ndependent upon the landlords from November to May for such employment as\r\nthey get.\r\n\r\nThe shopkeepers, too, are in a bad way, being in many cases reduced to\r\nthe condition of mere agents of the great wholesale houses elsewhere,\r\nand kept going by these houses mainly in the hope of recovering old\r\ndebts. There is a severe pressure of usury, too, upon the farmers. \"If a\r\nfarmer,\" said one resident to me, \"wants to borrow a small sum of the\r\nLoan Fund Bank, he must have two securities--one of them a substantial\r\nman good for the debt. These two indorsers must be 'treated' by the\r\nborrower whom they back; and he must pay them a weekly sum for the\r\ncountenance they have given him, which not seldom amounts, before he\r\ngets through with the matter, to a hundred per cent, on the original\r\nloan.\"\r\n\r\nI am assured too that the consumption of spirits all through this region\r\nhas greatly increased of late years. \"The official reports will show\r\nyou,\" said one gentleman, \"that the annual outlay upon whisky in Ireland\r\nequals the sum saved to the tenants by the reductions in rent.\" This is\r\na proposition so remarkable that I simply record it for future\r\nverification, as having been made by a very quiet, cool, and methodical\r\nperson, whose information on other points I have found to be correct. He\r\ntells me too, as of his own knowledge, that in going over some financial\r\nmatters with a small farmer in his neighbourhood, he ascertained, beyond\r\na peradventure, that this farmer annually spent in whisky, for the use\r\nof his family, consisting of himself, his wife and three adult children,\r\nnearly, or quite, _seventy pounds a year_! \"You won't believe this,\" he\r\nsaid to me; \"and if you print the statement nobody else will believe it;\r\nbut for all that it is the simple unexaggerated truth.\"\r\n\r\nFalstaff's reckoning at Dame Quickly's becomes a moderate score in\r\ncomparison with this!\r\n\r\nI spent half an hour again in the muniment-room at Kilkenny Castle,\r\nwhere, in the Expense-Book of the second Duke of Ormond, I found a\r\nsupper _menu_ worthy of record, as illustrating what people meant by\r\n\"keeping open house\" in the great families of the time of Queen\r\nAnne.[Note L.]\r\n\r\nTaking a train early in the afternoon, I came on here in time to dine\r\nlast night with Mr. Rolleston of Delgany, an uncompromising Protestant\r\n\"Home Ruler\"--as Protestant and as uncompromising as John Mitchel--whose\r\nrecent pamphlet on \"Boycotting\" has deservedly attracted so much\r\nattention on both sides of the Irish Sea.\r\n\r\nI was first led into a correspondence with Mr. Rolleston by a remarkable\r\narticle of his published in the _Dublin University Review_ for February\r\n1886, on \"The Archbishop in Politics.\" In that article, Mr. Rolleston,\r\nwhile avowing himself to be robust enough to digest without much\r\ndifficulty the _ex officio_ franchise conferred upon the Catholic clergy\r\nby Mr. Parnell to secure the acceptance of his candidates at\r\nParliamentary conventions, made a very firm and fearless protest against\r\nthe attempt of the Archbishops of Dublin and Cashel to \"boycott\"\r\nCatholic criticism of the National League and its methods, by declaring\r\nsuch criticism to be \"a public insult\" offered, not to the Archbishops\r\nof Cashel and Dublin personally, or as political supporters of the\r\nNational League, but to the Archbishops as dignitaries of the Catholic\r\nChurch, and to their Archiepiscopal office. The \"boycotting,\" by\r\nclerical machinery, of independent lay opinion in civil matters, is to\r\nthe body politic of a Catholic country what the germ of cancer is to the\r\nphysical body. And though Mr. Rolleston, in this article, avowed himself\r\nto be a hearty supporter of the \"political programme of the National\r\nLeague,\" and went so far even as to maintain that the social boycotting,\r\n\"which makes the League technically an illegal conspiracy against law\r\nand individual liberty,\" might be \"in many cases justified by the\r\nmagnitude of the legalised crime against which it was directed,\" it was\r\nobvious to me that he could not long remain blind to the true drift of\r\nthings in an organisation condemned, by the conditions it has created\r\nfor itself, to deal with the thinkers of Ireland as it deals with the\r\ntenants of Ireland. His recent pamphlet on \"Boycotting\" proves that I\r\nwas right. What he said to me the other day in a letter about the\r\npamphlet may be said as truly of the article. It was \"a shaft sunk into\r\nthe obscure depths of Irish opinion, to bring to light and turn to\r\nservice whatever there may be in those depths of sound and healthy;\" and\r\none of my special objects in this present visit to Ireland was to get a\r\npersonal touch of the intellectual movement which is throwing such\r\nthinkers as Mr. Rolleston to the front.\r\n\r\nWe were five at table, Mr. Rolleston's other guests being Mr. John\r\nO'Leary, whose name is held in honour for his courage and honesty by all\r\nwho know anything of the story of Ireland in our times, and who was sent\r\na quarter of a century ago as a Fenian patriot--not into seclusion with\r\nsherry and bitters, at Kilmainham, like Mr. Gladstone's \"suspects\" of\r\n1881--but like Michael Davitt, into the stern reality of penal\r\nservitude; Dr. Sigerson, Dean of the Faculty of Science of the Boyal\r\nUniversity, and an authority upon the complicated question of Irish Land\r\nTenures; and Mr. John F. Taylor, a leading barrister of Dublin, an ally\r\non the Land Question of Mr. Davitt, and an outspoken Repealer of the\r\nUnion of 1800.\r\n\r\nI have long wished to meet Mr. O'Leary, who sent me, through a\r\ncorrespondent of mine, two years ago, one of the most thoughtful and\r\nwell-considered papers I have ever read on the possibilities and\r\nimpossibilities of Home Rule for Ireland; and it was a great pleasure to\r\nfind in the man the elevation of tone, the breadth of view, and the\r\nrefined philosophic perception of the strong and weak points in the\r\nIrish case, which had charmed me in. the paper. Now that \"Conservative\"\r\nEnglishmen have come to treat the main points of Chartism almost as\r\ncommonplaces in politics, it is surely time for them to recognise the\r\nhonesty and integrity of the spirit which revolted in the Ireland of\r\n1848 against the then seemingly hopeless condition of that country. Of\r\nthat spirit Mr. O'Leary is a living, earnest, and most interesting\r\nincarnation. He strikes one at once as a much younger man in all that\r\nmakes the youth of the intellect and the emotions than any Nationalist\r\nM.P. of half his years whom I have ever met. No Irishman living has\r\ndealt stronger or more open blows than he against the English dominion\r\nin Ireland. Born in Tipperary, where he inherited a small property in\r\nhouses, he was sent to Trinity College in Dublin, and while a student\r\nthere was drawn into the \"Young Ireland\" party mainly by the poems of\r\nThomas Davis. Late in the electrical year of the \"battle summer,\" 1848,\r\nhe was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in a plot to rescue\r\nSmith O'Brien and other state prisoners. The suspicion was well founded,\r\nbut could not be established, and after a day or two he was liberated.\r\nFrom Trinity, after this, he went to the Queen's College in Cork, where\r\nhe took his degree, and studied medicine. When the Fenian movement\r\nbecame serious, after the close of our American Civil War, O'Leary threw\r\nhimself into it with Stephens, Luby, and Charles Kickham. Stephens\r\nappointed him one of the chief organisers of the I.E.B. with Luby and\r\nKickham, and he took charge of the _Irish People_--the organ of the\r\nFenians of 1865. It was as a subordinate contributor to this journal\r\nthat Sir William Harcourt's familiar Irish bogy, O'Donovan Rossa[26],\r\nwas arrested together with his chief, Mr. O'Leary, and with Kickham in\r\n1865, and found guilty, with them, after a trial before Mr. Justice\r\nKeogh, of treason-felony. The speech then delivered by Mr. O'Leary in\r\nthe dock made a profound impression upon the public mind in America. It\r\nwas the speech, not of a conspirator, but of a patriot. The indignation\r\nwith which he repelled for himself and for his associate Luby the\r\ncharges levelled at them both, without a particle of supporting\r\nevidence, by the prosecuting counsel, of aiming at massacre and plunder,\r\nwas its most salient feature. The terrible sentence passed upon him, of\r\npenal servitude for twenty years, Mr. O'Leary accepted with a calm\r\ndignity, which I am glad, for the sake of Irish manhood, to find that\r\nhis friends here now recall with pride, when their ears are vexed by the\r\nshrill and clamorous complaints of more recent \"patriots,\" under the\r\ncomparatively trivial punishments which they invite.\r\n\r\nIn 1870, Mr. O'Leary and his companions were released and pardoned on\r\ncondition of remaining beyond the British dominions until the expiration\r\nof their sentences. Mr. O'Leary fixed his residence for a time in Paris,\r\nand thence went to America, where he and Kickham were regarded as the\r\nleaders of the American branch of the I. R. B. He returned to Ireland in\r\n1885, his term of sentence having then expired, and it was shortly after\r\nhis return that he gave to my correspondent the letter upon Irish\r\naffairs to which I have already referred. He had been chosen President\r\nof the \"Young Ireland Society\" of Dublin before he returned, and in that\r\ncapacity delivered at the Rotunda, in the Irish capital, before a vast\r\ncrowd assembled to welcome him back, an address which showed how\r\nthoughtfully and calmly he had devoted himself during his long years of\r\nimprisonment and exile to the cause of Ireland. Mr. William O'Brien,\r\nM.P., and Mr. Redmond, M.P., took part in this reception, but their\r\nsubsequent course shows that they can hardly have relished Mr. O'Leary's\r\nfearless and outspoken protests against the intolerance and injustice of\r\nthe agrarian organisation which controls their action. In England, as\r\nwell as well as in Ireland, Mr. O'Leary spoke to great multitudes of his\r\ncountrymen, and always in the same sense. Mr. Rolleston tells me that\r\nMr. O'Leary's denunciations of \"the dynamite section of the Irish\r\npeople,\" to use the euphemism of an American journal, \"are the only ones\r\never uttered by an Irish leader, lay or clerical.\" The day must come, if\r\nit be not already close at hand, when the Irish leader of whom this can\r\nbe truly said, must be felt by his own people to be the one man worthy\r\nof their trust. The thing that has been shall be, and there is nothing\r\nnew under the sun. The Marats and the Robespierres, the Barères and the\r\nCollots, are the pallbearers, not the standard-bearers of liberty.\r\n\r\nTowards the National League, as at present administered on the lines of\r\nthe agrarian agitation, Mr. O'Leary has so far preserved an attitude of\r\nneutrality, though he has never for a moment hesitated either in public\r\nor in private most vehemently to condemn such sworn Fenians as have\r\naccepted seats in the British Parliament, speaking his mind freely and\r\nfirmly of them as \"double-oathed men\" playing a constitutional part with\r\none hand, and a treasonable part with the other.\r\n\r\nYet he is not at one with the extreme and fanatical Fenians who oppose\r\nconstitutional agitation simply because it is constitutional. His\r\nobjection to the existing Nationalism was exactly put, Mr. Rolleston\r\ntells me, by a clever writer in the Dublin _Mail_, who said that\r\nO'Connell having tried \"moral force\" and failed, and the Fenians having\r\ntried \"physical force\" and failed, the Leaguers were now trying to\r\nsucceed by the use of \"immoral force.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Sigerson, who, as a man of science, must necessarily revolt from the\r\ncoarse and clumsy methods of the blunderers who have done so much since\r\n1885 to discredit the cause of Ireland, evidently clings to the hope\r\nthat something may still be saved from the visible wreck of what has\r\ncome, even in Ireland, to be called \"Parnellism,\" and he good-naturedly\r\npersisted in speaking of our host last night and of his friends as\r\n\"mugwumps.\" For the \"mugwumps\" of my own country I have no particular\r\nadmiration, being rather inclined, with my friend Senator Conkling (now\r\ngone to his rest from the racket of American politics), to regard them\r\nas \"Madonnas who wish it to be distinctly understood that they might\r\nhave been Magdalens.\" But these Irish \"mugwumps\" seem to me to earn\r\ntheir title by simply refusing to believe that two and two, which make\r\nfour in France or China, can be bullied into making five in Ireland.\r\n\"What certain 'Parnellites' object to,\" said one of the company, \"is\r\nthat we can't be made to go out gathering grapes of thorns or figs of\r\nthistles. Some of them expect to found an Irish republic on robbery, and\r\nto administer it by falsehood. We don't.\"[27] This is precisely the\r\nspirit in which Mr. Rolleston wrote to me not long before I left England\r\nthis week. \"I have been slowly forced,\" he wrote, \"to the conclusion\r\nthat the National League is a body which deserves nothing but\r\nreprobation from all who wish well to Ireland. It has plunged this\r\ncountry into a state of moral degradation, from which it will take us at\r\nleast a generation to recover. It is teaching the people that no law of\r\njustice, of candour, of honour, or of humanity can be allowed to\r\ninterfere with the political ends of the moment. It is, in fact,\r\nabsolutely divorcing morality from politics. The mendacity of some of\r\nits leaders is shameless and sickening, and still more sickening is the\r\ncomplete indifference with which this mendacity is regarded in Ireland.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is the spirit, too, of a letter which I received not long ago from\r\nthe west of Ireland, in which my correspondent quoted the bearer of one\r\nof the most distinguished of Irish names, and a strong \"Home Ruler,\" as\r\nsaying to him, \"These Nationalists are stripping Irishmen as bare of\r\nmoral sense as the Bushmen of South Africa.\"\r\n\r\nThis very day I find in one of the leading Nationalist journals here\r\nletters from Mr. Davitt, Mr. O'Leary, and Mr. Taylor himself, which\r\nconvict that journal of making last week a statement about Mr. Taylor\r\nabsolutely untrue, and, so far as appears, absolutely without the shadow\r\nof a foundation. These letters throw such a curious light on passing\r\nevents here at this moment that I shall preserve them.[28] The statement\r\nto which they refer was thus put in the journal which made it: \"We have\r\nabsolute reason to know that when the last Coercion Act was in full\r\nswing this pure-souled and disinterested patriot (Mr. John F. Taylor)\r\nbegged for, received, and accepted a very petty Crown Prosecutorship\r\nunder a Coercion Government. As was wittily said at the time, He sold\r\nhis principles, not for a mess of pottage, but for the stick that\r\nstirred the mess.\" This is no assertion \"upon hearsay\"--no publication of\r\na rumour or report. It is an assertion made, not upon belief even, but\r\nupon a claim of \"absolute knowledge.\"\r\n\r\nYet to-day, in the same journal, I find Mr. Taylor declaring this\r\nstatement, made upon a claim of \"absolute knowledge,\" to be \"absolutely\r\nuntrue,\" and appealing in support of this declaration to Mr. Walker, the\r\nhost of Lord Riand Mr. Morley, and to The M'Dermot, Q.C., a conspicuous\r\nHome Ruler; to which Mr. Davitt adds: \"Mr. Taylor, on my advice,\r\ndeclined the Crown Prosecutorship for King's County, a post afterwards\r\napplied for by, and granted to, a near relative of one of the most\r\nprominent members of the Irish Party,\"--meaning Mr. Luke Dillon, a\r\ncousin of Mr. John Dillon, M.P.!\r\n\r\nWe had much interesting conversation last night about the relations of\r\nthe Irish leaders here with public and party questions in America, as to\r\nwhich I find Mr. O'Leary unusually well and accurately informed.\r\n\r\nI am sorry that I must get off to-morrow into Mayo to see Lord Lucan's\r\ncountry there, for I should have been particularly pleased to look more\r\nclosely with Mr. Rolleston into the intellectual revolt against\r\n\"Parnellism\" and its methods, of which his attitude and that of his\r\nfriends here is an unmistakable symptom. As he tersely puts it, he sees\r\n\"no hope in Irish politics, except a reformation of the League, a return\r\nto the principles of Thomas Davis.\"\r\n\r\nThe lines for a reformation or transformation of the League, as it now\r\nexists, appear to have been laid down in the original constitution of\r\nthe body. Under that constitution, it seems, the League was meant to be\r\ncontrolled by a representative committee chosen annually, open to public\r\ncriticism, and liable to removal by a new election. As things now are,\r\nthe officers of this alleged democratic organisation are absolutely\r\nself-elected, and wield the wide and indefinite power they possess over\r\nthe people of Ireland in a perfectly unauthorised, irresponsible way. It\r\nis a curious illustration of the autocratic or bureaucratic system under\r\nwhich the Irish movement is now conducted, that Mr. Davitt, who does not\r\npretend to be a Parliamentarian, and owes indeed much of his authority\r\nto his refusal to enter Parliament and take oaths of allegiance, does\r\nnot hesitate for a moment to discipline any Irish member of Parliament\r\nwho incurs his disapprobation. Sir Thomas Esmonde, for example, was\r\nseverely taken to task by him the other day in the public prints for\r\nventuring to put a question, in his place at Westminster, to the\r\nGovernment about a man-of-war stationed in Kingstown harbour. Mr. Davitt\r\nvery peremptorily ordered Sir Thomas to remember that he is not sent to\r\nWestminster to recognise the British Government, or concern himself\r\nabout British regiments or ships, and Sir Thomas accepts the rebuke in\r\nsilence. Whom does such a member of Parliament represent--the\r\nconstituents who nominally elect him, or the leader who cracks the whip\r\nover him so sharply?\r\n\r\nI have to-day been looking through a small and beautifully-printed\r\nvolume of poems just issued here by Gill and Son, Nationalist\r\npublishers, I take it, who have the courage of their convictions, since\r\ntheir books bear the imprint of \"O'Connell,\" and not of Sackville\r\nStreet. This little book of the _Poems and Ballads of Young Ireland _is\r\na symptom too. It is dedicated in a few brief but vigorous stanzas to\r\nJohn O'Leary, as one who\r\n\r\n                 \"Hated all things base,\r\n    And held his country's honour high.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the spirit of all the poems it contains is the spirit of '48, or of\r\nthat earlier Ireland of Robert Emmet, celebrated in some charming verses\r\nby \"Rose Kavanagh\" on \"St. Michan's Churchyard,\" where the\r\n\r\n                \"sunbeam went and came\r\n    Above the stone which waits the name\r\n    His land must write with freedom's flame.\"\r\n\r\nIt interests an American to find among these poems and ballads a\r\nstriking threnody called \"The Exile's Return,\" signed with the name of\r\n\"Patrick Henry\"; and it is noteworthy, for more reasons than one, that\r\nthe volume winds up with a \"Marching Song of the Gaelic Athletes,\"\r\nsigned \"An Chraoibhin Aoibbinn.\" These Athletes are numbered now, I am\r\nassured, not by thousands, but by myriads, and their organisation covers\r\nall parts of Ireland. If the spirit of '48 and of '98 is really moving\r\namong them, I should say they are likely to be at least as troublesome\r\nin the end to the \"uncrowned king\" as to the crowned Queen of Ireland.\r\n\r\nAs for the literary merit of these _Poems and Ballads of Young Ireland_,\r\nit strikes one key with their political quality. One exquisite ballad of\r\n\"The Stolen Child,\" by W. B. Yeats, might have been sung in the\r\nmoonlight on a sylvan lake by the spirit of Heinrich Heine.\r\n\r\nI spent an hour or two this morning most agreeably in the libraries of\r\nthe Law Courts and of Trinity College: the latter one of the stateliest\r\nmost academic \"halls of peace\" I have ever seen; and this afternoon I\r\ncalled upon Dr. Sigerson, a most patriotic Irishman, of obviously Danish\r\nblood, who has his own ideas as to Clontarf and Brian Boru; and who gave\r\nme very kindly a copy of his valuable report on that Irish Crisis of\r\n1879-80, out of which Michael Davitt so skilfully developed the agrarian\r\nmovement whereof \"Parnellism\" down to this time has been the not very\r\nwell adjusted instrument. The report was drawn up after a thorough\r\ninspection by Dr. Sigerson and his associate, Dr. Kenny, visiting\r\nphysicians to the North Dublin Union, of some of the most distressed\r\ndistricts of Mayo, Sligo, and Galway; and a more interesting,\r\nintelligent, and impressive picture of the worst phases of the social\r\nconditions of Ireland ten years ago is not to be found. I have just been\r\nreading it over carefully in conjunction with my memoranda made from the\r\nEmigration and Seed Potato Fund Reports, which Mr. Tuke gave me some\r\ntime ago, and it strongly reinforces the evidence imbedded in those\r\nreports, which goes to show that agitation for political objects in\r\nIreland has perhaps done as much as all other causes put together to\r\ndepress the condition of the poor in Ireland, by driving and keeping\r\ncapital out of the country. The worst districts visited in 1879 by Dr.\r\nSigerson and Dr. Kenny do not appear to have been so completely cut off\r\nfrom civilisation as was the region about Gweedore before the purchase\r\nof his property there by Lord George Hill, and the remedies suggested by\r\nDr. Sigerson for the suffering in these districts are all in the\r\ndirection of the remedies applied by Lord George Hill to the condition\r\nin which he found Gweedore. After giving full value to the stock\r\nexplanations of Irish distress in the congested districts, such as\r\nexcessive rents, penal laws, born of religious or \"racial\" animosity,\r\nand a defective system of land tenure, it seems to be clear that the\r\nmain difficulties have arisen from the isolation of these districts, and\r\nfrom the lack of varied industries. Political agitation has checked any\r\nflow of capital into these districts, and a flow of capital into them\r\nwould surely have given them better communications and more varied\r\nindustries. Dr. Sigerson states that some of the worst of these regions\r\nin the west of Ireland are as well adapted to flax-culture as Ulster,\r\nand Napoleon III. showed what could be done for such wastes as La\r\nSologne and the desert of the Landes by the intelligent study of a\r\ncountry and the judicious development of such values as are inherent in\r\nit. The loss of population in Ireland is not unprecedented. The State of\r\nNew Hampshire, in America, one of the original thirteen colonies which\r\nestablished the American Union, has twice shown an actual loss in\r\npopulation during the past century. The population of the State declined\r\nduring the decade between 1810 and 1820, and again during the decade\r\nbetween 1860 and 1870. This phenomenon, unique in American history, is\r\nto be explained only by three causes, all active in the case of\r\ncongested Ireland,--a decaying agriculture, lack of communications, and\r\nthe absence of varied industries. During the decade from 1860 to 1870\r\nthe great Civil War was fought out. Yet, despite the terrible waste of\r\nlife and capital in that war, especially at the South, the Northern\r\nState of New Hampshire, peopled by the energetic English adventurers who\r\nfounded New England, was actually the only State which came out of the\r\ncontest with a positive decline in population. Virginia (including West\r\nVirginia, which seceded from that Commonwealth in 1861) rose from\r\n1,596,318 inhabitants in 1860 to 1,667,177 in 1870. South Carolina,\r\nwhich was ravaged by the war more severely than any State except\r\nVirginia, and upon which the Republican majority at Washington pressed\r\nwith such revengeful hostility after the downfall of the Confederacy,\r\nshowed in 1870 a positive increase in population, as compared with 1860,\r\nfrom 703,708 to 705,606. But New Hampshire, lying hundreds of miles\r\nbeyond the area of the conflict, showed a positive decrease from 326,073\r\nto 318,300. During my college days at Cambridge the mountain regions of\r\nNew Hampshire were favourite \"stamping grounds\" in the vacations, and I\r\nexaggerate nothing when I say that in the secluded nooks and corners of\r\nthe State, the people cut off from communication with the rest of New\r\nEngland, and scratching out of a rocky land an inadequate subsistence,\r\nwere not much, if at all, in advance of the least prosperous dwellers in\r\nthe most remote parts of Ireland which I have visited. They furnished\r\ntheir full contingent to that strange American exodus, which, about a\r\nquarter of a century ago, was led out of New England by one Adams to the\r\nHoly Land, in anticipation of the Second Advent, a real modern crusade\r\nof superstitious land speculators, there to perish, for the most part,\r\nmiserably about Jaffa--leaving houses and allotments to pass into the\r\ncontrol of a more practical colony of Teutons, which I found\r\nestablishing itself there in 1869.\r\n\r\nSince 1870 a change has come over New Hampshire. The population has\r\nrisen to 346,984. In places waste and fallen twenty years ago brisk and\r\nsmiling villages have sprung up along lines of communication established\r\nto carry on the business of thriving factories.\r\n\r\nWhat reason can there be in the nature of things to prevent the\r\ndevelopment of analogous results, through the application of analogous\r\nforces, in the case of \"congested\" Ireland? A Nationalist friend, to\r\nwhom I put this question this afternoon, answers it by alleging that so\r\nlong as fiscal laws for Ireland are made at Westminster, British capital\r\ninvested in Great Britain will prevent the application of these\r\nanalogous forces to \"congested\" Ireland. His notion is that were Ireland\r\nas independent of Great Britain, for example, in fiscal matters as is\r\nCanada, Ireland might seek and secure a fiscal union with the United\r\nStates, such as was partially secured to Canada under the Reciprocity\r\nTreaty denounced by Mr. Seward.\r\n\r\n\"Give us this,\" he said, \"and take us into your system of American\r\nfree-trade as between the different States of your American Union, and\r\nno end of capital will soon be coming into Ireland, not only from your\r\nenormously rich and growing Republic, but from Great Britain too. Give\r\nus the American market, putting Great Britain on a less-favoured\r\nfooting, just as Mr. Blake and his party wish to do in the case of\r\nCanada, and between India doing her own manufacturing on the one side,\r\nand Ireland becoming a manufacturing centre on the other, and a mart in\r\nEurope for American goods, we'll get our revenge on Elizabeth and\r\nCromwell in a fashion John Bull has never dreamt of in these times,\r\nthough he used to be in a mortal funk of it a hundred years ago, when\r\nthere wasn't nearly as much danger of it!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDUBLIN, _Sunday, June 24._--\"Put not your faith in porters!\" I had\r\nexpected to pass this day at Castlebar, on the estate of Lord Lucan, and\r\nI exchanged telegrams to that effect yesterday with Mr. Harding, the\r\nEarl's grandson, who, in the absence of his wonderfully energetic\r\ngrandsire, is administering there what Lord Lucan, with pardonable\r\npride, declares to be the finest and most successful dairy-farm in all\r\nIreland. I asked the porter to find the earliest morning train; and\r\nafter a careful search he assured me that by leaving Dublin just after 7\r\nA.M. I could reach Castlebar a little after noon.\r\n\r\nUpon this I determined to dine with Mr. Colomb, and spend the night in\r\nDublin. But when I reached the station a couple of hours ago, it was to\r\ndiscover that my excellent porter had confounded 7 A.M. with 7 P.M.\r\n\r\nThere is no morning train to Castlebar! So here I am with no recourse,\r\nmy time being short, but to give up the glimpse I had promised myself of\r\nMayo, and go on this afternoon to Belfast on my way back to London.\r\n\r\nAt dinner last night Mr. Colomb gave me further and very interesting\r\nlight upon the events of 1867, of which he had already spoken with me at\r\nCork, as well as upon the critical period of Mr. Gladstone's experiments\r\nof 1881-82 at \"Coercion\" in Ireland.\r\n\r\nMr. Colomb lives in a remarkably bright and pleasant suburb of Dublin,\r\nwhich not only is called a \"park,\" as suburbs are apt to be, but really\r\nis a park, as suburbs are less apt to be. His house is set near some\r\nvery fine old trees, shading a beautiful expanse of turf. He is an\r\namateur artist of much more than ordinary skill. His walls are gay, and\r\nhis portfolios filled, with charming water-colours, sketches, and\r\nstudies made from Nature all over the United Kingdom. The grand\r\ncoast-scenery of Cornwall and of Western Ireland, the lovely lake\r\nlandscapes of Killarney, sylvan homes and storied towers, all have been\r\nlaid under contribution by an eye quick to seize and a hand prompt to\r\nreproduce these most subtle and transient atmospheric effects of light\r\nand colour which are the legitimate domain of the true water-colourist.\r\nWith all these pictures about us--and with Mr. Colomb's workshop fitted\r\nup with Armstrong lathes and all manner of tools wherein he varies the\r\nroutine of official life by making all manner of instruments, and\r\nwreaking his ingenuity upon all kinds of inventions--and with the\r\npleasant company of Mr. Davies, the agreeable and accomplished official\r\nsecretary of Sir West Ridgway, the evening wore quickly away. In the\r\ncourse of conversation the question of the average income of the Irish\r\npriests arose, and I mentioned the fact that Lord Lucan, whose knowledge\r\nof the smallest details of Irish life is amazingly thorough, puts it\r\ndown at about ten shillings a year per house in the average Irish\r\nparish.\r\n\r\nHe rated Father M'Fadden and his curate of Gweedore, for example,\r\nwithout a moment's hesitation, at a thousand pounds a year in the whole,\r\nor very nearly the amount stated to me by Sergeant Mahony at Baron's\r\nCourt. This brought from Mr. Davies a curious account of the proceedings\r\nin a recent case of a contested will before Judge Warren here in Dublin.\r\nThe will in question was made by the late Father M'Garvey of Milford, a\r\nlittle village near Mulroy Bay in Donegal, notable chiefly as the scene\r\nof the murder of the late Earl of Leitrim. Father M'Garvey, who died in\r\nMarch last, left by this will to religious and charitable uses the whole\r\nof his property, save £800 bequeathed in it to his niece, Mrs. O'Connor.\r\nIt was found that he died possessed not only of a farm at Ardara, but of\r\ncash on deposit in the Northern Bank to the very respectable amount of\r\n£23,711. Mrs. O'Connor contested the will. The Archbishop of Armagh, and\r\nFather Sheridan, C.C. of Letterkenny, instituted an action against her\r\nto establish the will. Father M'Fadden of Gweedore, lying in Londonderry\r\njail as a first-class misdemeanant, was brought from Londonderry as a\r\nwitness for the niece. But on the trial of the case it appeared that\r\nthere was actually no evidence to sustain the plea of the niece that\r\n\"undue influence\" had been exerted upon her uncle by the Archbishop, who\r\nat the time of the making of the will was Bishop of Raphoe, or by\r\nanybody else; so the judge instructed the jury to find on all the issues\r\nfor the plaintiffs, which was done. The judge declared the conduct of\r\nthe defendant in advancing a charge of \"undue influence\" in such\r\ncircumstances against ecclesiastics to be most reprehensible; but the\r\nArchbishop very graciously intimated through his lawyer his intention of\r\npaying the costs of the niece who had given him all this trouble,\r\nbecause she was a poor woman who had been led into her course by\r\ndisappointment at receiving so small a part of so large an inheritance.\r\nHad the priest's property come to him in any other way than through his\r\noffice as a priest her claim might have been more worthy of\r\nconsideration, but Mr. M'Dermot, Q.C., who represented the Archbishop,\r\ntook pains to make it clear that as an ecclesiastic his client, who had\r\nnothing to do with the making of the will, was bound to regard it \"as\r\nproper and in accordance with the fitness of things that what had been\r\nreceived from the poor should be given back to the poor.\"\r\n\r\nI see no adequate answer to this contention of the Archbishop. But it\r\ncertainly goes to confirm the estimates given me by Sergeant Mahony of\r\nFather M'Fadden's receipts at Gweedore, and the opinion expressed to me\r\nby Lord Lucan as to the average returns of an average Catholic parish,\r\nthat the priest of Milford, a place hardly so considerable as Gweedore,\r\nshould have acquired so handsome a property in the exercise there of his\r\nparochial functions.\r\n\r\nOne form in which the priests in many parts of Ireland collect dues is\r\ncertainly unknown to the practice of the Church elsewhere, I believe,\r\nand it must tend to swell the incomes of the priests at the expense,\r\nperhaps, of their legitimate influence. This is the custom of personal\r\ncollections by the priests. In many parishes the priest stands by the\r\nchurch-door, or walks about the church--not with a bag in his hand, as\r\nis sometimes done in France on great occasions when a _quéle_ is made by\r\nthe _curé_ for some special object,--but with an open plate in which the\r\npeople put their offerings. I have heard of parishes in which the priest\r\nsits by a table near the church-door, takes the offerings from the\r\nparishioners as they pass, and comments freely upon the ratio of the\r\ngift to the known or presumed financial ability of the giver.\r\n\r\nWe had some curious stories, too, from a gentleman present of the\r\nrelation of the priests in wild, out-of-the-way corners of Ireland to\r\nthe people, stories which take one back to days long before Lever. One,\r\nfor example, of a delightful and stalwart old parish priest of eighty,\r\nupon whom an airy young patriot called to propose that he should accept\r\nthe presidency of a local Land League. The veteran, whose only idea of\r\nthe Land League was that it had used bad language about Cardinal Cullen,\r\nno sooner caught the drift of the youth than he snatched up a huge\r\nblackthorn, fell upon him, and \"boycotted\" him head-foremost out of a\r\nwindow. Luckily it was on the ground floor.\r\n\r\nAnother strenuous spiritual shepherd came down during the distribution\r\nof potato-seed to the little port in which it was going on, and took up\r\nhis station on board of the distributing ship. One of his parishioners,\r\nhaving received his due quota, made his way back again unobserved on\r\nboard of the ship. As he came up to receive a second dole, the good\r\nfather spied him, and staying not \"to parley or dissemble,\" simply\r\nfetched him a whack over the sconce with a stick, which tumbled him out\r\nof the ship, head-foremost, into the hooker riding beside her! Quite of\r\nanother drift was a much more astonishing tale of certain proceedings\r\nhad here in February last before the Lord Chief-Justice. These took\r\nplace in connection with a motion to quash the verdict of a coroner's\r\njury, held in August 1887, on the body of a child named Ellen Gaffney,\r\nat Philipstown, in King's County, which preserves the memory of the\r\nSpanish sovereign of England, as Maryborough in Queen's preserves the\r\nmemory of his Tudor consort. Cervantes never imagined an Alcalde of the\r\nquality of the \"Crowner\"' who figures in this story. Were it not that\r\nhis antics cost a poor woman her liberty from August 1887 till December\r\nof that year, when the happy chance of a winter assizes set her free,\r\nand might have cost her her life, the story of this ideal magistrate\r\nwould be extremely diverting.\r\n\r\nA child was born to Mrs. Gaffney at Philipstown on the 23d of July, and\r\ndied there on the 25th of August 1887, Mrs. Gaffney being the wife of a\r\n\"boycotted\" man.\r\n\r\nA local doctor named Clarke came to the police and asked the Sergeant to\r\ninspect the body of the child, and call for an inquest. The sergeant\r\ninspected the body, and saw no reason to doubt that the child had died a\r\nnatural death. This did not please the doctor, so the Coroner was sent\r\nfor. He came to Philipstown the next day, conferred there with the\r\ndoctor, and with a priest, Father Bergin, and proceeded to hold an\r\ninquest on the child in a public-house, \"a most appropriate place,\" said\r\nSir Michael Morris from the bench, \"for the transactions which\r\nsubsequently occurred.\" Strong depositions were afterwards made by the\r\nwoman Mrs. Gaffney, by her husband, and by the police authorities, as to\r\nthe conduct of this \"inquest.\" She and her husband were arrested on a\r\nverbal order of the Coroner on the day when the inquest was held, August\r\n27th, and the woman was kept in prison from that time till the assizes\r\nin December. The \"inquest\" was not completed on the 27th of August, and\r\nafter the Coroner adjourned it, two priests drove away on a car from the\r\n\"public-house\" in which it had been held. That night, or the next day, a\r\nman came to a magistrate with a bundle of papers which he had found in\r\nthe road near Philipstown. The magistrate examined them, and finding\r\nthem to be the depositions taken before the Coroner in the case of Ellen\r\nGaffney, handed them to the police. How did they come to be in the road?\r\nOn the 1st of September the Coroner resumed his inquest, this time in\r\nthe Court-House at Philipstown, and one of the police, with the\r\ndepositions in his pocket, went to hear the proceedings. Great was his\r\namazement to see certain papers produced, and calmly read, as being the\r\nvery original depositions which at that moment were in his own custody!\r\nHe held his peace, and let the inquest go on. A letter was read from the\r\nCoroner, to the effect that he saw no ground for detaining the husband,\r\nGaffney--but the woman was taken before a justice of the peace, and\r\ncommitted to prison on this finding by the Coroner's jury: \"That Mary\r\nAnne Gaffney came by her death; and that the mother of the child, Ellen\r\nGaffney, is guilty of wilful neglect by not supplying the necessary food\r\nand care to sustain the life of this child \"!\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely credible, but it is true, that upon this extraordinary\r\nfinding the Coroner issued a warrant for \"murder\" against this poor\r\nwoman, on which she was actually locked up for more than three months!\r\nThe jury which made this unique finding consisted of nineteen persons,\r\nand it was in evidence that their foreman reported thirteen of the jury\r\nto be for finding one way and six for finding another, whereupon a\r\ncertain Mr. Whyte, who came into the case as the representative of\r\nFather Bergin, President of the local branch of the National\r\nLeague--nobody can quite see on what colourable pretext--was allowed by\r\nthe Coroner to write down the finding I have quoted, and hand it to the\r\nCoroner. The Coroner read it over. He and Mr. Whyte then put six of the\r\njury in one place, and thirteen in another; the Coroner read the finding\r\naloud to the thirteen, and said to them, \"Is that what you agree to?\"\r\nand so the inquest was closed, and the warrant issued--for murder--and\r\nthe woman, this poor peasant mother sent off to jail with the brand upon\r\nher of infanticide.[29]\r\n\r\nWhere would that poor woman be now were there no \"Coercion\" in Ireland\r\nto protect her against \"Crowner's quest law\" thus administered? And what\r\nis to be thought of educated and responsible public men in England who,\r\nas recent events have shown, are not ashamed to go to \"Crowner's quest\r\nCourts\" of this sort for weapons of attack, not upon the administration\r\nonly of their own Government, but upon the character and the motives of\r\ntheir political opponents?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nBELFAST, _Monday, June 25._--I left Dublin yesterday at 4 P.M., in a\r\ntrain which went off at high pressure as an \"express,\" but came into\r\nBelfast panting and dilatory as an \"excursion.\" The day was fine, and\r\nthe line passes through what is reputed to be the most prosperous part\r\nof Ireland. In this part of Ireland, too, the fate of the island has\r\nbeen more than once settled by the arbitrament of arms; and if\r\nParliamentary England throws up the sponge in the wrestle with the\r\nLeague, it is probable enough that the old story will come to be told\r\nover again here.\r\n\r\nAt Dundalk the Irish monarchy of the Braces was made and unmade. The\r\nplantation of Ulster under James I. clinched the grasp not so much of\r\nEngland as of Scotland upon Ireland, and determined the course of events\r\nhere through the Great Rebellion. The landing of the Duke of Schomberg\r\nat Carrickfergus opened the way for the subjugation of Jacobite Ireland\r\nby William of Orange. The successful descent of the French upon the same\r\nplace in February 1760, after the close of \"the Great Year,\" in which\r\nWalpole tells us he came to expect a new victory every morning with the\r\nrolls for breakfast, and after Hawke had broken the strength of the\r\ngreat French Armada off Belleisle, and done for England the service\r\nwhich Nelson did for her again off Trafalgar in 1805, shows what might\r\nhave happened had Thurot commanded the fleet of Conflans. In this same\r\nregion, too, the rout of Munro by Nugent at Ballinahinch practically\r\nended the insurrection of 1798.\r\n\r\nThere are good reasons in the physical geography of the British Islands\r\nfor this controlling influence of Ulster over the affairs of Ireland,\r\nwhich it seems to me a serious mistake to overlook.\r\n\r\nThe author of a brief but very hard-headed and practical letter on the\r\npacification of Ireland, which appeared in the _Times_ newspaper in\r\n1886, while the air was thrilling with rumours of Mr. Gladstone's\r\nimpending appearance as the champion of \"Home Rule,\" carried, I\r\nremember, to the account of St. George's Channel \"nine-tenths of the\r\ntroubles, religious, political, and social, under which Ireland has\r\nlaboured for seven centuries.\" I cannot help thinking he hit the nail on\r\nthe head; and St. George's Channel does not divide Ulster from Scotland.\r\nFrom Donaghadee, which has an excellent harbour, the houses on the\r\nScottish coast can easily be made out in clear weather. A chain is no\r\nstronger than its weakest link, and it is as hard to see how, even with\r\nthe consent of Ulster, the independence of Ireland could be maintained\r\nagainst the interests and the will of Scotland, as it is easy to see why\r\nLeinster, Munster, and Connaught have been so difficult of control and\r\nassimilation by England. To dream of establishing the independence of\r\nIreland against the will of Ulster appears to me to be little short of\r\nmadness.\r\n\r\nAt Moira, which stands very prettily above the Ulster Canal, a small\r\narmy of people returning from a day in the country to Belfast came upon\r\nus and trebled the length of our train. We picked up more at Lisburn,\r\nwhere stands the Cathedral Church of Jeremy Taylor, the \"Shakespeare of\r\ndivines.\" Here my only companion in the compartment from Dublin left me,\r\na most kindly, intelligent Ulster man, who had very positive views as to\r\nthe political situation. He much commended the recent discourse in\r\nScotland of a Presbyterian minister, who spoke of the Papal Decree as\r\n\"pouring water on a drowned mouse,\" a remark which led me to elicit the\r\nfact that he had never seen either Clare or Kerry; and he was very warm\r\nin his admiration of Mr. Chamberlain. He told me, what I had heard from\r\nmany other men of Ulster, that the North had armed itself thoroughly\r\nwhen the Home Rule business began with Mr. Gladstone. \"I am a Unionist,\"\r\nhe said, \"but I think the Union is worth as much to England as it is to\r\nIreland, and if England means to break it up it is not the part of\r\nIrishmen who think and feel as I do to let her choose her own time for\r\ndoing it, and stand still while she robs us of our property and turns us\r\nout defenceless to be trampled under foot by the most worthless\r\nvagabonds in our own island.\" He thinks the National League has had its\r\ndeath-blow. \"What I fear now,\" he said, \"is that we are running straight\r\ninto a social war, and that will never be a war against the landlords in\r\nIreland; it'll be a war against the Protestants and all the decent\r\npeople there are among the Catholics.\"\r\n\r\nHe was very cordial when he found I was an American, and with that\r\noffhand hospitality which seems to know no distinctions of race or\r\nreligion in Ireland urged me to come and make him a visit at a place he\r\nhas nearer the sea-coast. \"I'll show you Downpatrick,\" he said, \"where\r\nthe tombs of St. Patrick and St. Bridget and St. Columb are, the saints\r\nsleeping quite at their ease, with a fine prosperous Presbyterian town\r\nall about them. And I'll drive you to Tullymore, where you'll see the\r\nmost beautiful park, and the finest views from it all the way to the\r\nIsle of Man, that are to be seen in all Ireland.\" He was very much\r\ninterested in the curious story of the sequestration of the remains of\r\nMr. Stewart of New York, who was born, he tells me, at Lisburn, where\r\nthe wildest fabrications on the subject seem to have got currency. That\r\nthis feat of body-snatching is supposed to have been performed by a\r\nlittle syndicate of Italians, afterwards broken up by the firmness of\r\nLady Crawford in resisting the ghastly pressure to which the widow and\r\nthe executors of Mr. Stewart are believed to have succumbed, was quite a\r\nnew idea to him.\r\n\r\nFrom Moira to Belfast the scenery along the line grows in beauty\r\nsteadily. If Belfast were not the busiest and most thriving city in\r\nIreland, it would still be well worth a visit for the picturesque charms\r\nof its situation and of the scenery which surrounds it. At some future\r\nday I hope to get a better notion both of its activity and of its\r\nattractions than it would be possible for me to attempt to get in this\r\nflying visit, made solely to take the touch of the atmosphere of the\r\nplace at this season of the year; for we are on the very eve of the\r\nbattle month of the Boyne.\r\n\r\nMr. Cameron, the Town Inspector of the Royal Irish Constabulary, met me\r\nat the station, in accordance with a promise which he kindly made when I\r\nsaw him several weeks ago at Cork; and this morning he took me all over\r\nthe city. It is very well laid out, in the new quarters especially, with\r\nbroad avenues and spacious squares. In fact, as a local wag said to me\r\nto-day at the Ulster Club, \"You can drive through Belfast without once\r\ngoing into a street\"--most of the thoroughfares which are not called\r\n\"avenues\" or \"places\" being known as \"roads.\" It is, of course, an\r\nessentially modern city. When Boate made his survey of Ireland two\r\ncenturies ago, Belfast was so small a place that he took small note of\r\nit, though it had been incorporated by James I. in 1613 in favour of the\r\nChichester family, still represented here. In a very careful _Tour in\r\nIreland_, published at Dublin in 1780, the author says of Belfast, \"I\r\ncould not help remarking the great number of Scots who reside in this\r\nplace, and who carry on a good trade with Scotland.\" It seems then to\r\nhave had a population of less than 20,000 souls, as it only touched that\r\nnumber at the beginning of this century. It has since then advanced by\r\n\"leaps and bounds,\" after an almost American fashion, till it has now\r\nbecome the second, and bids fair at no distant day to become the first,\r\ncity in Ireland. Few of the American cities which are its true\r\ncontemporaries can be compared with Belfast in beauty. The quarter in\r\nwhich my host lives was reclaimed from the sea marshes not quite so long\r\nago, I believe, as was the Commonwealth Avenue quarter of Boston, and\r\nthough it does not show so many costly private houses perhaps as that\r\nquarter of the New England capital, its \"roads\" and \"avenues\" are on the\r\nwhole better built, and there is no public building in Boston so\r\nimposing as the Queen's College, with its Tudor front six hundred feet\r\nin length, and its graceful central tower. The Botanic Gardens near by\r\nare much prettier and much better equipped for the pleasure and\r\ninstruction of the people than any public gardens in either Boston or\r\nNew York. These American comparisons make themselves, all the conditions\r\nof Belfast being rather of the New World than of the Old. The oldest\r\nbuilding pointed out to me to-day is the whilom mansion of the Marquis\r\nof Donegal, now used as offices, and still called the Castle.\r\n\r\nThis stands near Donegal Square, a fine site, disfigured by a quadrangle\r\nof commonplace brick buildings, occupied as a sort of Linen Exchange,\r\nconcerning which a controversy rages, I am told. They are erected on\r\nland granted by Lord Donegal to encourage the linen trade, and the\r\nbuildings used to be leased at a rental of £1 per window. The present\r\nholders receive £10 per window, and are naturally loath to part with so\r\ngood a thing, though there is an earnest desire in the city to see these\r\nunsightly structures removed, and their place taken by stately municipal\r\nbuildings more in key with the really remarkable and monumental private\r\nwarehouses which already adorn this Square. Mr. Robinson, one of the\r\npartners of a firm which has just completed one of these warehouses, was\r\ngood enough to show us over it. It is built of a warm grey stone, which\r\nlends itself easily to the chisel, and it is decorated with a wealth of\r\ncarving and of architectural ornaments such as the great burghers of\r\nFlanders lavished on their public buildings. The interior arrangements\r\nare worthy of the external stateliness of the warehouse. Pneumatic tubes\r\nfor the delivery of cash--a Scottish invention--electric lights, steam\r\nlifts, a kitchen at the top of the lofty edifice heated by steam from\r\nthe great engine-room in the cellars, and furnishing meals to the\r\nemployees, attest the energy and enterprise of the firm. The most\r\ndelicate of the linen fabrics sold here are made, I was informed, all\r\nover the north country. The looms, three or four of which are kept going\r\nhere in a great room to show the intricacy and perfection of the\r\nprocesses, are supplied by the firm to the hand-workers on a system\r\nwhich enables them, while earning good wages from week to week, to\r\nacquire the eventual ownership of the machines. The building is crowned\r\nby a sort of observatory, from which we enjoyed a noble prospect\r\noverlooking the whole city and miles of the beautiful country around. A\r\nhaze on the horizon hid the coast of Scotland, which is quite visible\r\nunder a clear sky. The Queen's Bridge over the Lagan, built in 1842\r\nbetween Antrim and Down, was a conspicuous feature in the panorama. Its\r\nfive great arches of hewn granite span the distance formerly traversed\r\nby an older bridge of twenty-one arches 840 feet in length, which was\r\nbegun in 1682, and finished just in time to welcome Schomberg and King\r\nWilliam.\r\n\r\nThe not less imposing warehouse of Richardson and Co., built of a\r\nsingularly beautiful brown stone, and decorated with equal taste and\r\nliberality, adjoins that of Robinson and Cleaver. The banks, the public\r\noffices, the clubs, the city library, the museum, the Presbyterian\r\ncollege, the principal churches, all of them modern, all alike bear\r\nwitness to the public spirit and pride in their town of the good people\r\nof Belfast. With more time at my disposal I would have been very glad to\r\nvisit some of the flax-mills called into being by the great impulse\r\nwhich the cotton famine resulting from our Civil War gave to the linen\r\nmanufactures of Northern Ireland, and the famous shipyards of the Woolfs\r\non Queen's Island, As things are, it was more to my purpose to see some\r\nof the representative men of this great Protestant stronghold.\r\n\r\nI passed a very interesting hour with the Rev. Dr. Hanna, who is reputed\r\nto be a sort of clerical \"Lion of the North,\" and whom I found to be in\r\nalmost all respects a complete antitype of Father M'Fadden of Gweedore.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Hanna is not unjustly proud of being at the head of the most\r\nextensive Sunday-school organisation in Ireland, if not in the world;\r\nand I find that the anniversary parade of his pupils, appointed for\r\nSaturday, June 30th, is looked forward to with some anxiety by the\r\nauthorities here. He tells me that he expects to put two thousand\r\nchildren that day into motion for a grand excursion to Moira; but\r\nalthough he speaks very plainly as to the ill-will with which a certain\r\nclass of the Catholics here regard both himself and his organisation, he\r\ndoes not anticipate any attack from them. With what seems to me very\r\ncommendable prudence, he has resolved this year to put this procession\r\ninto the streets without banners and bands, so that no charge of\r\nprovocation may be even colourably advanced against it. This is no\r\nslight concession from a man so determined and so outspoken, not to say\r\naggressive, in his Protestantism as Dr. Hanna; and the Nationalist\r\nCatholics will be very ill-advised, it strikes me, if they misinterpret\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHe spoke respectfully of the Papal decree against Boycotting and the\r\nPlan of Campaign; but he seems to think it will not command the respect\r\nof the masses of the Catholic population, nor be really enforced by the\r\nclergy. Like most of the Ulstermen I have met, he has a firm faith, not\r\nonly in the power of the Protestant North to protect itself, but in its\r\ndetermination to protect itself against the consequences which the\r\nnorthern Protestants believe must inevitably follow any attempt to\r\nestablish an Irish nationality. Dr. Hanna is neither an Orangeman nor a\r\nTory. He says there are but three known Orangemen among the clerical\r\nmembers of the General Assembly of the Irish Presbyterian Church, which\r\nunanimously pronounced against Mr. Gladstone's scheme of Home Rule, and\r\nnot more than a dozen Tories. Of the 550 members of the Assembly, 538,\r\nhe says, were followers of Mr. Gladstone before he adopted the politics\r\nof Mr. Parnell; and only three out of the whole number have given him\r\ntheir support. In the country at large, Dr. Hanna puts down the\r\nUnionists at two millions, of whom 1,200,000 are Protestants, and\r\n800,000 Catholics; and he maintains that if the Parliamentary\r\nrepresentatives were chosen by a general vote, the Parnellite 80 would\r\nbe cut down to 62; while the Unionists would number 44. He regards the\r\nParnellite policy as \"an organised imposture,\" and firmly believes that\r\nan Irish Parliament in Dublin would now mean civil war in Ireland. He\r\nhad a visit here last week, he says, from an American Presbyterian\r\nminister, who came out to Ireland a month ago a \"Home Ruler\"; but, as\r\nthe result of a trip through North-Western Ireland, is going back to\r\ndenounce the Home Rule movement as a mischievous fraud.\r\n\r\nWhen I asked him what remedy he would propose for the discontent stirred\r\nup by the agitation of Home Rule, this Presbyterian clergyman replied\r\nemphatically, \"Balfour, Balfour, and more Balfour!\"\r\n\r\nThis on the ground, as I understood, that Mr. Balfour's administration\r\nof the law has been the firmest, least wavering, and most equitable\r\nknown in Ireland for many a day.\r\n\r\nLater in the day I had the pleasure of a conversation with the Rev. Dr.\r\nKane, the Grand Master of the Orangemen at Belfast. Dr. Kane is a tall,\r\nfine-looking, frank, and resolute man, who obviously has the courage of\r\nhis opinions. He thinks there will be no disturbances this year on the\r\n12th of July, but that the Orange demonstrations will be on a greater\r\nscale and more imposing than ever. He derides the notion that\r\n\"Parnellism\" is making any progress in Ulster. On the contrary, the\r\nconcurrence this year of the anniversary of the defeat of the Great\r\nArmada with the anniversary of the Revolution of 1688 has aroused the\r\nstrongest feelings of enthusiasm among the Protestants of the North, and\r\nthey were never so determined as they now are not to tolerate anything\r\nremotely looking to the constitution of a separate and separatist\r\nGovernment at Dublin.\r\n\r\nBELFAST, _Tuesday, June 26._--Sir John Preston, the head of one of the\r\ngreat Belfast houses, and a former Mayor of the city, dined with us last\r\nnight, and in the evening Sir James Haslett, the actual Mayor, came in.\r\n\r\nI find that in Belfast the office of Mayor is served without a salary,\r\nand is consequently filled as a rule by citizens of \"weight and\r\ninstance.\" In Dublin the Lord Mayor receives £3000 a year, with a\r\ncontingent fund of £1500, and the office is becoming a distinctly\r\npolitical post. The face of Belfast is so firmly set against the\r\ntendency to subordinate municipal interests to general party exigencies,\r\nthat the Corporation compelled Mr. Cobain, M.P., who sits at Westminster\r\nnow for this constituency, to resign the post which he held as treasurer\r\nand cashier of the Corporation when he became a candidate for a seat in\r\nParliament. I am not surprised, therefore, to learn that the city rates\r\nand taxes are much lower in the commercial than they are in the\r\npolitical capital of Ireland.\r\n\r\nBoth Sir John Preston and Sir James Haslett have visited America. Sir\r\nJohn went there to represent the linen industries of Ireland, and to\r\nurge upon Congress the propriety of reducing our import duties upon\r\nfabrics which the American climate makes it practically imposssible to\r\nmanufacture on our side of the water. Senator Sherman, who twenty years\r\nago had the candour to admit that the wit of man could not devise a\r\ntariff so adjusted as to raise the revenue necessary for the Government\r\nwhich should not afford adequate incidental protection to all legitimate\r\nAmerican industries, gave Sir John reason to hope that something might\r\nbe done in the direction of a more liberal treatment of the linen\r\nindustries. But nothing practical came of it. Sir John ought to have\r\nknown that our typical American Protectionist, the late Horace Greeley,\r\nreally persuaded himself, and tried to persuade other people, that with\r\nduties enough clapped on the Asiatic production, excellent tea might be\r\ngrown on the uplands of South Carolina!\r\n\r\nIn former years Sir John Preston used to visit Gweedore every year for\r\nsport and recreation. He knew Lord George Hill very well, \"as true and\r\nnoble a man as ever lived, who stinted himself to improve the state of\r\nhis tenants.\" He threw an odd light on the dreamy desire which had so\r\nmuch amused me of the \"beauty of Gweedore\" to become \"a dressmaker at\r\nDerry,\" by telling me that long ago the gossips there used to tell\r\nwonderful stories of a Gweedore girl who had made her fortune as a\r\nmilliner in the \"Maiden City.\"\r\n\r\nThis morning Mr. Cameron, who as Town Inspector of the Royal Irish\r\nConstabulary will be responsible for public peace and order here during\r\nthe next critical fortnight, held a review of his men on a common beyond\r\nthe Theological College. About two hundred and fifty of the force were\r\nparaded, with about twenty mounted policemen, and for an hour and a\r\nhalf, under a tolerably warm sun, they were put through a regular\r\nmilitary drill. A finer body of men cannot be seen, and in point of\r\ndiscipline and training they can hold their own, I should say, with the\r\nbest of her Majesty's regiments. Without such discipline and training it\r\nwould not be easy for any such body of men to pass with composure\r\nthrough the ordeal of insults and abuse to which the testimony of\r\ntrustworthy eye-witnesses compels me to believe they are habitually\r\nsubjected in the more disturbed districts of Ireland. As to the\r\nimmediate outlook here, Mr. Cameron seems quite at his ease. Even if\r\nill-disposed persons should set about provoking a collision between \"the\r\nvictors and the vanquished of the Boyne\" his arrangements are so made,\r\nhe says, as to prevent the development of anything like the outbreaks of\r\nformer years.\r\n\r\nOn the advice of Sir John Preston I shall take the Fleetwood route on my\r\nreturn to London to-night.\r\n\r\nThis secures one a comfortable night on board of a very good and\r\nwell-equipped boat, from which you go ashore, he tells me, into an\r\nexcellent station of the London and North-Western Railway at Fleetwood,\r\non the mouth of the Wyre on the Lancashire coast. Twenty years ago this\r\nwas a small bathing resort called into existence chiefly by the\r\nenterprise of a local baronet whose name it bears. Its present\r\nprosperity and prospective importance are another illustration of the\r\nvigour and vitality of the North of Ireland, which is connected through\r\nFleetwood with the great manufacturing regions of middle and northern\r\nEngland, as it is through Larne with the heart of Scotland.\r\n\r\nWhile it is as true now of the predominantly Catholic south of Ireland\r\nas it was when Sir Robert Peel made the remark forty years ago, that it\r\nstands \"with its back to England and its face to the West,\" this\r\nProtestant Ireland of the North faces both ways, drawing Canada and the\r\nUnited States to itself through Moville and Derry and Belfast, and\r\nholding fast at the same time upon the resources of Great Britain\r\nthrough Glasgow and Liverpool. One of the best informed bankers in\r\nLondon told me not long ago, that pretty nearly all the securities of\r\nthe great company which has recently taken over the business of the\r\nGuinnesses have already found their way into the North of Ireland and\r\nare held here. With such resources in its wealth and industry, better\r\neducated, better equipped, and holding a practically impregnable\r\nposition in the North of Ireland, with Scotland and the sea at its back,\r\nUlster is very much stronger relatively to the rest of Ireland than La\r\nVendée was relatively to the rest of the French Republic in the last\r\ncentury. In a struggle for independence against the rest of Ireland it\r\nwould have nothing to fear from the United States, where any attempt to\r\norganise hostilities against it would put the Irish-American population\r\nin serious peril, not only from the American Government, but from\r\npopular feeling, and force home upon the attention of the\r\nquickest-witted people in the world the significant fact that while the\r\nchief contributions, so far, of America to Southern Ireland, have been\r\nalms and agitation, the chief contributions of Scotland to Northern\r\nIreland have been skilled agriculture and successful activity. It is\r\nsurely not without meaning that the only steamers of Irish build which\r\nnow traverse the Atlantic come from the dockyards, not of Galway nor of\r\nCork, the natural gateways of Ireland to the west, but of Belfast, the\r\nnatural gateway of Ireland to the north.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEPILOGUE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot once, but a hundred times, during the visits to Ireland recorded in\r\nthis book, I have been reminded of the state of feeling and opinion\r\nwhich existed in the Border States, as they were called, of the American\r\nUnion, after the invasion of Virginia by a piratical band under John\r\nBrown, and before the long-pending issues between the South, insisting\r\nupon its constitutional rights, and the North, restive under its\r\nconstitutional obligations, were brought to a head by the election of\r\nPresident Lincoln.\r\n\r\nAll analogies, I know, are deceptive, and I do not insist upon this\r\nanalogy. But it has a certain value here. For to-day in Ireland, as then\r\nin America, we find a grave question of politics, in itself not\r\nunmanageable, perhaps, by a race trained to self-government, seriously\r\ncomplicated and aggravated, not only by considerations of moral right\r\nand moral wrong, but by a profound perturbation of the material\r\ninterests of the community.\r\n\r\nI well remember that after a careful study of the situation in America\r\nat the time of which I speak, Mr. Nassau Senior, a most careful and\r\ncompetent observer, frankly told me that he saw no possible way in which\r\nthe problem could be worked out peacefully. The event justified this\r\ngloomy forecast.\r\n\r\nIt would be presumptuous in me to say as much of the actual situation in\r\nIreland; but it would be uncandid not to say that the optimists of\r\nMaryland, Virginia, Kentucky, Missouri, and Tennessee had greater\r\napparent odds in their favour in 1861 than the optimists of Ireland seem\r\nto me to have in 1888.\r\n\r\nIreland stands to-day between Great Britain and the millions of the\r\nIrish race in America and Australia very much as the Border States of\r\nthe American Union stood in 1861 between the North and the South. There\r\nwas little either in the Tariff question or in the Slavery question to\r\nshake the foundations of law and order in the Border States, could they\r\nhave been left to themselves; and the Border States enjoyed all the\r\nadvantages and immunities of \"Home Rule\" to an extent and under\r\nguarantees never yet openly demanded for Ireland by any responsible\r\nlegislator within the walls of the British Parliament. But so powerful\r\nwas the leverage upon them of conflicting passions and interests beyond\r\ntheir own borders that these sovereign states, well organised,\r\nhomogeneous, prosperous communities, much more populous and richer in\r\nthe aggregate in 1861 than Ireland is to-day, practically lost the\r\ncontrol of their own affairs, and were swept helplessly into a terrific\r\nconflict, which they had the greatest imaginable interest in avoiding,\r\nand no interest whatever in promoting.\r\n\r\nI have seen and heard nothing in Ireland to warrant the very common\r\nimpression that the country, as a whole, is either misgoverned or\r\nungovernable; nothing to justify me in regarding the difficulties which\r\nthere impede the maintenance of law and order as really indigenous and\r\nspontaneous. The \"agitated\" Ireland of 1888 appears to me to be almost\r\nas clearly and demonstrably the creation of forces not generated in, but\r\nacting upon, a country, as was the \"bleeding Kansas\" of 1856. But the\r\n\"bleeding Kansas\" of 1856 brought the great American Union to the verge\r\nof disruption, and the \"agitated Ireland\" of 1888 may do as much, or\r\nworse, for the British Empire. There is, no doubt, a great deal of\r\ndistress in one or another part of Ireland, though it has not been my\r\nfortune to come upon any outward and visible signs of such grinding\r\nmisery as forces itself upon you in certain of the richest provinces of\r\nthat independent, busy, prosperous, Roman Catholic kingdom of Belgium,\r\nwhich on a territory little more than one-third as large as the\r\nterritory of Ireland, maintains nearly a million more inhabitants, and\r\nadds to its population, on an average, in round numbers, as many people\r\nin four years as Ireland loses in five.\r\n\r\nI have seen peasant proprietors in Flanders and Brabant who could give\r\nthe ideal Irish agent of the Nationalist newspapers lessons in\r\nrack-renting, though I am not at all sure that they might not get a hint\r\nor two themselves from some of the small farmers who came in my way in\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nLike all countries, mainly agricultural, too, Ireland has suffered a\r\ngreat deal of late years from the fall in prices following upon a period\r\nof intoxicating prosperity. Whether she has suffered more relatively\r\nthan we should have suffered from the same cause in America, had we been\r\nfoolish enough to imitate the monometallic policy of Germany in 1873, is\r\nhowever open to question; and I have an impression, which it will\r\nrequire evidence to remove, that the actual organisation known as the\r\nNational Land League could never have been called into being had the\r\nBritish Government devoted to action upon the Currency Question, before\r\n1879, the time and energy which it has expended before and since that\r\ndate in unsettling the principles of free contract, and tinkering at the\r\nrelations of landlord and tenant in Ireland.\r\n\r\nBut I am trenching upon inquiries here beyond the province of this book.\r\n\r\nFortunately it is not necessary to my object in printing these volumes\r\nthat I should either form or formulate any positive opinions as to the\r\norigin of the existing crisis in Ireland. Nor need I volunteer any\r\nsuggestions of my own as to the methods by which order may best be\r\nmaintained and civil government carried on in Ireland. It suffices for\r\nme that I close this self-imposed survey of men and things in that\r\ncountry with a conviction, as positive as it is melancholy, that the\r\nwork which Mr. Redmond, M.P., informed us at Chicago that he and his\r\nNationalist colleagues had undertaken, of \"making the government of\r\nIreland by England impossible,\" has been so far achieved, and by such\r\nmethods as to make it extremely doubtful whether Ireland can be governed\r\nby anybody at all in accordance with any of the systems of government\r\nhitherto recognised in or adopted for that country. I certainly can see\r\nnothing in the organisation and conduct, down to this time, of the party\r\nknown as the party of the Irish Nationalists, I will not say to\r\nencourage, but even to excuse, a belief that Ireland could be governed\r\nas a civilised country were it turned over to-morrow to their control. A\r\ngreat deal has been done by them to propagate throughout Christendom a\r\ngeneral impression that England has dismally failed to govern Ireland in\r\nthe past, and is unlikely hereafter to succeed in governing Ireland. But\r\neven granting this impression to be absolutely well founded, it by no\r\nmeans follows that Ireland is any more capable of governing herself than\r\nEngland is of governing her. The Russians have not made a brilliant\r\nsuccess of their administration in Poland, but the Poles certainly\r\nadministered Poland no better than the Russians have done. With an Irish\r\nrepresentation in an Imperial British Parliament at Westminster,\r\nIreland, under Mr. Gladstone's \"base and blackguard\" Union of 1800, has\r\nat least succeeded in shaking off some of the weightiest of the burdens\r\nby which, in the days of Swift, of Grattan, and of O'Connell, she most\r\nloudly declared herself to be oppressed. Whether with a Parliament at\r\nDublin she would have fared as well in this respect since 1800 must be a\r\nmatter of conjecture merely--and it must be equally a matter of\r\nconjecture also whether she would fare any better in this respect with a\r\nParliament at Dublin hereafter. I am in no position to pronounce upon\r\nthis--but it is quite certain that nothing is more uncommon than to find\r\nan educated and intelligent man, not an active partisan, in Ireland\r\nto-day, who looks forward to the reestablishment, in existing\r\ncircumstances, of a Parliament at Dublin with confidence or hope.\r\n\r\nHow the establishment of such a Parliament would affect the position of\r\nGreat Britain as a power in Europe, and how it would affect the fiscal\r\npolicy, and with the fiscal policy the well-being of the British people,\r\nare questions for British subjects to consider, not for me.\r\n\r\nThat the processes employed during the past decade, and now employed to\r\nbring about the establishment of such a Parliament, have been, and are\r\nin their nature, essentially revolutionary, subversive of all sound and\r\nhealthy relations between man and man, inconsistent with social\r\nstability, and therefore with social progress and with social peace,\r\nwhat I have seen and heard in Ireland during the past six months compels\r\nme to feel. Of the \"Coercion,\" under which the Nationalist speakers and\r\nwriters ask us in America to believe that the island groans and\r\ntravails, I have seen literally nothing.\r\n\r\nNowhere in the world is the press more absolutely free than to-day in\r\nIreland. Nowhere in the world are the actions of men in authority more\r\nbitterly and unsparingly criticised. If public men or private citizens\r\nare sent to prison in Ireland, they are sent there, not as they were in\r\nAmerica during the civil war, or in Ireland under the \"Coercion Act\" of\r\n1881, on suspicion of something they may have done, or may have intended\r\nto do, but after being tried for doing, and convicted of having done,\r\ncertain things made offences against the law by a Parliament in which\r\nthey are represented, and of which, in some cases, they are members.\r\n\r\nTo call this \"Coercion\" is, from the American point of view, simply\r\nludicrous. What it may be from the British or the Irish point of view is\r\nanother affair, and does not concern me. I may be permitted, however, I\r\nhope without incivility, to say that if this be \"Coercion\" from the\r\nBritish or the Irish point of view, I am well content to be an American\r\ncitizen. Ours is essentially a government not of emotions, but of\r\nstatutes, and most Americans, I think, will agree with me that the sage\r\nwas right who declared it to be better to live where nothing is lawful\r\nthan where all things are lawful.\r\n\r\nThe \"Coercion\" which I have found established in Ireland, and which I\r\nrecognise in the title of this book, is the \"Coercion,\" not of a\r\ngovernment, but of a combination to make a particular government\r\nimpossible. It is a \"Coercion\" applied not to men who break a public\r\nlaw, or offend against any recognised code of morals, but to men who\r\nrefuse to be bound in their personal relations and their business\r\ntransactions by the will of other men, their equals only, clothed with\r\nno legal authority over them. It is a \"Coercion\" administered not by\r\npublic and responsible functionaries, but by secret tribunals. Its\r\nsanctions are not the law and honest public opinion, but the base\r\ninstinct of personal cowardice, and the instinct, not less base, of\r\npersonal greed. Whether anything more than a steady, firm administration\r\nof the law is needed to abolish this \"Coercion\" is a matter as to which\r\nauthorities differ. I should be glad to believe with Colonel Saunderson\r\nthat \"the Leaguers would not hold up the 'land-grabber' to execration,\r\nand denounce him as they do, unless they knew in fact that the moment\r\nthe law is made supreme in Ireland the tenants would become just as\r\namenable to it as any other subjects of the Queen.\" But some recent\r\nevents suggest a doubt whether these \"other subjects of the Queen\" are\r\nas amenable to the law as my own countrymen are.\r\n\r\nThat the Church to which the great majority of the Irish people have for\r\nso many ages, and through so many tribulations, borne steadfast\r\nallegiance, has been shaken in its hold upon the conscience of Ireland\r\nby the machinery of this odious and ignoble \"Coercion,\" appears to me to\r\nbe unquestionable. That the head of that Church, being compelled by\r\nevidence to believe this, has found it necessary to intervene for the\r\nrestoration of the just spiritual authority of the Church over the Irish\r\npeople all the world now knows--nor can I think that his intervention\r\nhas come a day or an hour too soon, to arrest the progress in Ireland of\r\na social disease which threatens, not the political interests of the\r\nempire of which Ireland is a part alone, but the character of the Irish\r\npeople themselves, and the very existence among them of the elementary\r\nconditions of a Christian civilisation.\r\n\r\nIt would be unjust to the Irish people to forget that this demoralising\r\n\"Coercion\" against which the Head of the Catholic Church has declared\r\nwar, seems to me to have been seriously reinforced by the Land\r\nLegislation of the Imperial Parliament.\r\n\r\nNo one denies that great reforms and readjustments of the Land Tenure in\r\nIreland needed to be made long before any serious attempt was made to\r\nmake them.\r\n\r\nBut that such reforms and readjustments might have been made without\r\ncutting completely loose from the moorings of political economy, appears\r\npretty clearly, not only from examples on the continent of Europe, and\r\nin my own country, but from the Rent and Tenancy Acts carried out in\r\nIndia under the viceroyalty of Lord Dufferin since 1885. The conditions\r\nof these measures were different, of course, in each of the cases of\r\nOudh, Bengal, and the Punjab, and in none of these cases were they\r\nnearly identical with the conditions of any practicable land measure for\r\nIreland. But two great characteristics seem to me to mark the Indian\r\nlegislation, which are not conspicuous in the legislation for Ireland.\r\n\r\nThese are a spirit of equity as between the landlords and the tenants,\r\nand finality. I do not see how it can be questioned that the landlords\r\nof Ireland have been dealt with by recent British legislation as if they\r\nwere offenders to be mulcted, and that the tenants in Ireland have been\r\nencouraged by recent British legislation to anticipate an eventual\r\ntransfer to them, on steadily improving terms, of the land-ownership of\r\nthe island. Mr. Davitt is perhaps the most popular Irishman living, and\r\nI believe him to be sincerely convinced that the ownership of the land\r\nof Ireland (and of all other countries) ought to be vested in the State.\r\nBut if the independence of Ireland were acknowledged by Great Britain\r\nto-morrow, and all the actual landlords of Ireland were compelled\r\nto-morrow to part with their ownership, such as it is, of the land, I\r\nbelieve Mr. Davitt would be further from the recognition and triumph of\r\nhis principle of State-ownership than he is to-day with a British\r\nParliament hostile to \"Home Rule,\" but apparently not altogether\r\nunwilling to make the landlords of Ireland an acceptable burnt-offering\r\nupon the altar of imperial unity. Probably he sees this himself, and the\r\nexisting state of things may not be wholly displeasing to him, as\r\nholding out a hope that the flame which he has been helped by British\r\nlegislation to kindle in Ireland may already be taking hold upon the\r\nsubstructions and outworks of the edifice of property in Great Britain\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nOne thing at least is clear.\r\n\r\nThe two antagonistic principles which confront each other in Ireland\r\nto-day are the principles of the Agrarian Revolution represented by Mr.\r\nDavitt, and the principle of Authority, represented in the domain of\r\npolitics by the British Government, and in the domain of morals by the\r\nVatican. With one or the other of these principles the victory must\r\nrest. If the Irish people of all classes who live in Ireland could be\r\npolled to-day, it is likely enough that a decisive majority of them\r\nwould declare for the principle of Authority in the State and in the\r\nChurch, could that over-riding issue be made perfectly plain and\r\nintelligible to them. But how is that possible? In what country of the\r\nworld, and in what age of the world, has it ever been possible to get\r\nsuch an issue made perfectly plain and intelligible to any people?\r\n\r\nIn the domain of morals the principle of Authority, so far as concerns\r\nCatholic Ireland, rests with a power which is not likely to waver or\r\ngive way. The Papal Decree has gone forth. Those who profess to accept\r\nit will be compelled to obey it. Those who reject it, whatever their\r\nplace in the hierarchy of the Church may be, must sooner or later find\r\nthemselves where Dr. M'Glynn of New York now is. Catholic Ireland can\r\nonly continue to be Catholic on the condition of obedience, not formal\r\nbut real, not in matters indifferent, but in matters vital and\r\nimportant, to the Head of the Catholic Church.\r\n\r\nIn the domain of politics the principle of Authority rests with an\r\nAdministration which is at the mercy of the intelligence or the\r\nignorance, the constancy or the fickleness, the weakness or the\r\nstrength, of constituencies in Great Britain, not necessarily familiar\r\nwith the facts of the situation in Ireland, not necessarily enlightened\r\nas to the real interests either of Great Britain or of Ireland, nor even\r\nnecessarily awake, with Cardinal Manning, to the truth that upon the\r\nfuture of Ireland hangs the future of the British Empire.\r\n\r\nWith two, three, four, or five years of a steady and cool administration\r\nof the laws in Ireland, by an executive officer such as Mr. Balfour\r\nseems to me to have shown himself to be--with a judicious abstinence of\r\nthe British Legislature from feverish and fussy legislation about\r\nIreland, with a prudent and persistent development of the material\r\nresources of Ireland, and with a genuine co-operation of the people who\r\nown land in Ireland with the people who wish to own land in Ireland, for\r\nthe readjustment of land-ownership, the principle of Authority in the\r\ndomain of politics may doubtless win in the conflict with the principle\r\nof the Agrarian revolution.\r\n\r\nBut how many contingencies are here involved! Meanwhile the influences\r\nwhich imperil in Ireland the principle of Authority, in the domains\r\nalike of politics and of morals, are at work incessantly, to undermine\r\nand deteriorate the character of the Irish people, to take the vigour\r\nand the manhood out of them, to unfit them day by day, not only for good\r\ncitizenship in the British Empire or the United States, but for good\r\ncitizenship in any possible Ireland under any possible form of\r\ngovernment. To arrest these influences before they bring on in Ireland a\r\nsocial crash, the effects of which must be felt far beyond the\r\nboundaries of that country, is a matter of primary importance,\r\ndoubtless, to the British people. It is a matter, too, of hardly less\r\nthan primary importance to the people of my own country. Unfortunately\r\nit does not rest with us to devise or to apply an efficient check to\r\nthese influences.\r\n\r\nThat rests with the people of Great Britain, so long as they insist that\r\nIreland shall remain an integral portion of the British dominions. I do\r\nnot see how they can acquit themselves of this responsibility, or escape\r\nthe consequences of evading it, solely by devising the most ingenious\r\nmachinery of local administration for Ireland, or the most liberal\r\nschemes for fostering the material interests of the Irish people. Such\r\nthings, of course, must in due time be attended to. But the first duty\r\nof a government is to govern; and I believe that Earl Grey has summed up\r\nthe situation in Ireland more concisely and more courageously than any\r\nother British statesman in his outspoken declaration, that \"in order to\r\navert the wreck of the nation, it is absolutely necessary that some\r\nmeans or other should be found for securing to Ireland during the\r\npresent crisis a wiser and more stable administration of its affairs\r\nthan can be looked for under its existing institutions.\"\r\n\r\nI have heard and read a good deal in the past of the \"Three F's\" thought\r\na panacea for Irish discontent. Three other F's seem to me quite as\r\nimportant to the future of Irish content and public order. These are,\r\nFair Dealing towards Landlords as well as Tenants; Finality of Agrarian\r\nLegislation at Westminster; and last and most essential of all, Fixity\r\nof Executive Tenure.\r\n\r\nThe words I have just quoted of Earl Grey, show it to be the conviction\r\nof the oldest living leader of English Liberalism that this last is the\r\nvital point, the key of the situation. Let me bracket with his words,\r\nand leave to the consideration of my readers, the following pregnant\r\npassage from a letter written to me by an Irish correspondent who is as\r\ndevoted to Irish independence as is Earl Grey to imperial unity:--\r\n\r\n\"If the present Nationalist movement succeeds, it will have the effect\r\nof putting the worst elements of the Irish nation in power, and keeping\r\nthem there irremoveably. We are to have an Executive at the mercy of a\r\nHouse of Representatives, and the result will be a government, or series\r\nof governments, as weak and vicious as those of France, with this\r\ndifference, that here all purifying changes such as seem imminent in\r\nFrance will be absolutely prevented by the irresistible power of\r\nEngland. The true model for us would be a constitution like yours in the\r\nUnited States, with an Executive responsible to the nation at large, and\r\nirremoveable for a term of years. But this we shall never get from\r\nEngland. Shall we make use of Home Rule to take it for ourselves?\r\n\r\n\"Many earnest and active Irish Unionists now say that if any bill\r\nresembling Mr. Gladstone's passes, they will make separation, their\r\ndefinite policy. If Home Rule comes without the landlords having been\r\nbought out on reasonable terms, a class will be created in Ireland full\r\nof bitter and most just hatred of England--a class which may very likely\r\none day play the part here which the persecuted Irish Presbyterians who\r\nfled from the tyranny of the English Church in Ireland played in your\r\nown Revolution beyond the Atlantic.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><hr /></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\nNOTE F.\r\n\r\nTHE \"MOONLIGHTERS\" AND \"HOME RULE.\"\r\n\r\n(Vol. ii. p. 38.)\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the 1st of February 1886, the _Irish Times_ published the\r\nfollowing story from Tralee, near the scene of the \"boycotting,\"\r\ntemporal and spiritual, of the unfortunate daughters of Mr. Jeremiah\r\nCurtin, murdered in his own house by \"moonlighters\":--\r\n\r\n   \"TRALEE, _Sunday_.\r\n\r\n   \"It was stated that the bishop had ordered Mass to be celebrated\r\n    for them--the Curtins--but this did not take place. At the village\r\n    of Firies a number of people had assembled. They stopped loitering\r\n    about the place in the forenoon, waiting for a meeting of the\r\n    National League, which was subsequently held. A threatening notice\r\n    was discovered posted up on the door of a house formerly used as a\r\n    forge. It ran as follows:--\r\n\r\n   \"'NOTICE.--If we are honoured by the presence of the bloodthirsty\r\n    perjurers at Mass on any of the forthcoming Sundays, take good care\r\n    you'll stand up very politely and walk out.

Canon Keller gave me of \"The Struggle for\r\nLife on the Ponsonby Estate,\" in a tract bearing that title, and\r\nauthorised by him to be published by the National League, is so\r\ncircumstantial and elaborate that, after reading it carefully, I took\r\nunusual pains to obtain some reply to it from the representatives of the\r\nlandlord implicated. These finally led to a visit from Mr. Ponsonby\r\nhimself, who was so kind as to call upon me in London on the 15th of\r\nMay, with papers and documents. I give in the following colloquy the\r\nresults of this interview, putting together with the allegations of\r\nCanon Keller the answers of Mr. Ponsonby, and leave the matter in this\r\nform to the judgment of my readers.\r\n\r\n_Q_. Canon Keller, I see, describes you, Mr. Ponsonby, as \"a retired\r\nnavy officer, and an absentee Irish landlord.\" He says your estate is\r\nnow \"universally known as the famous Ponsonby Estate,\" and that it is\r\noccupied \"by from 300 to 400 tenants, holding farms varying in extent\r\nfrom an acre and a half to over two hundred acres.\" Are these statements\r\ncorrect?\r\n\r\n_A_. I am a retired navy officer certainly, and perhaps I may be called\r\nan \"absentee Irish landlord.\" I lived on my property for some time, and\r\nI have always attended to it. I succeeded to the estate in 1868, and\r\nalmost my first act was to borrow £2000 of the Board of Works for\r\ndrainage purposes--the tenants agreeing to pay half the interest. As a\r\nmatter of fact some never paid at all, and I afterwards wiped out the\r\nclaims against them. There are about 300 tenants on the property, and\r\nthe average holdings are of about 36 acres, at an average rental of £30\r\na holding. There are, however, not a few large farms.\r\n\r\n_Q_. Canon Keller says that \"in the memory of living witnesses, and far\r\nbeyond it, the Ponsonby tenants have been notoriously rack-rented and\r\noppressed\"; and that they have been committed to the \"tender mercies of\r\nagents, seeing little or nothing of their landlord, and experiencing no\r\npractical sympathy from that quarter.\" How is this?\r\n\r\n_A_. I wish to believe Canon Keller truthful when he knows the truth. He\r\ncertainly does not know the truth here. He is a newcomer at Youghal,\r\nhaving come there in November 1885, and hardly so much of an authority\r\nabout \"the memory of living witnesses and far beyond it\" as the tenants\r\non the estate, who, when I went there first with my wife, presented to\r\nme, May 25, 1868, an address of welcome, referring in very different\r\nterms to the history of the estate and of my family connection with it.\r\nHere is the original address, and a copy of it--the latter being quite\r\nat your service.\r\n\r\nThis original address is very handsomely engrossed, and is signed by\r\nfifty tenants. Among the names I observed those of Martin Loughlin,\r\nPeter McDonough, Michael Gould, William Forrest, and John Heaphey, all\r\nof whom are cited by Canon Keller in his tract as conspicuous victims of\r\nthe oppression and rack-renting which he says have prevailed upon the\r\nPonsonby estates time out of mind. It was rather surprising, therefore,\r\nto find them joining with more than forty other tenants to sign an\r\naddress, of which I here print the text:--\r\n\r\n    To C.W. TALBOT PONSONBY, Esq.\r\n\r\n    Honoured Sir,--The Tenantry of your Estates near Youghal have heard\r\n    with extreme pleasure of the arrival of yourself and lady in the\r\n    neighbourhood, and have deputed us to address you on their behalf.\r\n\r\n    Through us they bid you and Mrs. Ponsonby welcome, and respectfully\r\n    congratulate you on your accession to the Estates.\r\n\r\n    The name of Ponsonby is traditionally revered in this part of the\r\n    country, being associated in the recollections and impressions of\r\n    the people with all that is exalted, honourable, and generous. It\r\n    has been matter of regret that the heads of the family have not\r\n    (probably from uncontrollable causes) visited these Estates for\r\n    many years, but the tenantry have never wavered in their sentiments\r\n    of respect towards them.\r\n\r\n    We will not disguise from you the conviction generally entertained\r\n    that the improvement of landed property, and the condition of its\r\n    occupiers, is best promoted under the personal observation and\r\n    supervision of the proprietor, and your tenantry on that account\r\n    hail with satisfaction the promise your presence affords of future\r\n    intercourse between you and them.\r\n\r\n    Again, on the part of your Tenants and all connected with your\r\n    Estates, tendering you and your lady a most hearty welcome, and\r\n    sincerely wishing you and her a long and happy career--We subscribe\r\n    ourselves, Honoured Sir, Respectfully yours,\r\n\r\n    YOUGHAL, _May_ 1868.\r\n\r\n_Q_. Did Canon Keller ever see this address, may I ask, Mr. Ponsonby?\r\n\r\n_A_. I believe not; and I may as well say at once that I suppose he has\r\ntaken for gospel all the stories which any of the tenants under the\r\nterrorism which has been established on the place think it best to pour\r\ninto his listening ear. As I have said, he is quite a new man at\r\nYoughal, and when he first came there he was a quiet and not at all\r\nrevolutionary priest. You saw him, and saw how good his manners are, and\r\nthat he is a well-educated man. But on Sunday, November 7, 1886, a great\r\nmeeting was held at Youghal. It was a queer meeting for a Sunday, being\r\nopenly a political meeting, with banners and bands, to hear speeches\r\nfrom Mr. Lane, M.P., Mr. Flynn, M.P., and others. The Rev. Mr. Keller\r\npresided, and a priest from America, Father Hayes of Georgetown, Iowa,\r\nin the United States, was present. It was ostensibly a Home Rule\r\nmeeting, but the burden of the speeches was agrarian. Mr. Lane, M.P.,\r\nmade a bitter personal attack on another Nationalist member, Sir Joseph\r\nM'Kenna of Killeagh, calling him a \"heartless and inhuman landlord;\" and\r\nmy property was also attended to by Mr. Lane, who advised my tenants\r\nopenly not to accept my offer of 20 per cent. reduction, but to demand\r\n40 per cent. Father Hayes in his speech bade \"every man stand to his\r\nguns,\" and wound up by declaring that if England and the landlords\r\nbehaved in America as they behaved in Ireland, the Americans \"would pelt\r\nthem not only with dynamite, but with the lightnings of Heaven and the\r\nfires of hell, till every British bull-dog, whelp, and cur would be\r\npulverised and made top-dressing for the soil.\" Canon Keller afterwards\r\nexpressed disapproval of this speech of Hayes, and this coming to the\r\nknowledge of Hayes in America, Hayes denounced Keller for not daring to\r\ndo this at the time in his presence. Since then Canon Keller has been\r\nmuch more violent in tone.\r\n\r\n_Q_. I don't want to carry you through a long examination, Mr. Ponsonby,\r\nbut I see typical cases here, about which I should like to ask a\r\nquestion or two. Here, is Callaghan Flavin, for instance, described by\r\nCanon Keller as one of eight tenants who \"had to retreat before the\r\ncrowbar brigade,\" and who \"deserved a better fate.\" Canon Keller says he\r\nis assured by a competent judge that Flavin's improvements, \"full value\r\nfor £341, 10s.,\" are now \"the landlord's property.\" What are the facts\r\nabout Mr. Flavin?\r\n\r\n_A_. Mr. Flavin's farm was held by his cousin, Ellen Flavin of Gilmore,\r\nwho, on the 7th of February 1872, surrendered it to the landlord on\r\nreceiving from me a sum of £172, 10s. 6d. I obtained a charging order\r\nunder section 27 of the Land Act, entitling me to an annuity of £8, 12s.\r\n6d. for thirty-five years from July 3, 1872. It was let to Callaghan\r\nFlavin in preference to other applicants, July 3, 1872; and in 1873, at\r\nhis request, I obtained a loan from the Board of Works for the thorough\r\ndraining of a portion of the farm. Thirteen acres were drained at a cost\r\nof £84, 6s. 3d., for which the tenant promised to pay 5 per cent.\r\ninterest, which I eventually forgave him. There was no house on the\r\nfarm. He took it without one, and I did not want one there. He built a\r\nhouse himself without consulting my agent, and then wanted me to make\r\nhim an allowance for it. I told him he had thirty-one years to enjoy it\r\nin, and must be content with that. About the same time he took another\r\nfarm of mine at a rent of £35. Since I came into my property in 1868 I\r\nhave laid out upon it in drainage, buildings, and planting--here are the\r\naccounts, which you may look at--over £15,000, including about £8000 of\r\nloans from the Board of Works. In the drainage the tenants got work for\r\nwhich they were paid. I gave them slates for the buildings, with timber\r\nand stone from the estate, and they supplied the labour. There is no\r\ncase in which the outlays for improvements came from the tenants--not a\r\nsingle one. I repeat it, Canon Keller's tract is a tissue of fictions.\r\n\r\nWhat nonsense it is to talk about the \"traditional rack-renting\" of a\r\nproperty held by the Ponsonbys for two hundred years, the tenants on\r\nwhich could welcome me when I came into it with the language of the\r\naddress you have here seen!\r\n\r\nI never evicted tenants for less than three years' arrears, till what\r\nCanon Keller calls the \"crowbar brigade,\" by which he means the officers\r\nof the law, had to be put into action to meet the \"Plan of Campaign\" in\r\nMay last. I did not proceed against the tenants because they could not\r\npay. I selected the tenants who could pay, and who were led, or, I\r\nbelieve in most cases, \"coerced,\" into refusing to pay by agitators with\r\nMr. Lane, M.P., to inspire them, and Canon Keller, P.P., to glorify them\r\nin a tract.\r\n\r\n_Q_. What were your personal relations with the tenants when you were at\r\nInchiquin?\r\n\r\n_A_. Always most friendly; and even the other day when I was there,\r\nwhile none of them would speak to me when they were all together, those\r\nI met individually touched their hats, and were as civil as ever. I\r\nbelieve they would all be thankful to have things as they were, and I\r\nhave never refused to meet and treat with them on fair individual terms.\r\n\r\nIn November 1885 my offer of an abatement of 15 per cent. being refused,\r\na few tenants, I believe, clubbed their rents, and for the sake of peace\r\nI then offered 20 per cent., which they accepted and paid. In October\r\n1886 I hoped to prevent trouble by making the same offer of 20 per cent.\r\nabatement on non-judicial and 10 per cent. on judicial rents. One man\r\ntook the latter abatement and paid. Then another tenant demanded 40 per\r\ncent. My agent said he would give them time, and also take money on\r\naccount, the effect of which would be to put me out of court, and\r\nprevent my getting an order of ejectment if I wanted to for the balance.\r\nI thought this fair, and approved it, but I refused to make a 40 per\r\ncent. all-round abatement, authorising my agent, however, to make what\r\nabatements he liked in special cases. My words were, \"I don't limit you\r\non the amount of abatement you give, or as to the number of tenants you\r\nmay choose so to treat.\" If this was not a fair free hand, what would\r\nbe? My agent afterwards told me he had no chance to make this known. The\r\nfact is they meant to force the Plan on the tenants and me, and to\r\nprevent any settlement but a \"victory for the League!\"\r\n\r\nIn my original notes of my conversation with Father Keller at Youghal, I\r\nfound the name of one tenant whom he introduced to me, and who certainly\r\ntold me that his holdings amounted to some £300 a year, and that they\r\nhad been in his family for \"two hundred years,\" set down as Doyle--I so\r\nprinted it with the statements made. But Father Keller, to whom I\r\nsubmitted my proofs, and who was so good as to revise them, struck out\r\nthe name of Doyle, and inserted that of Loughlin, putting the rental\r\ndown at £94 (vol. ii. p. 71). Of course I accept this correction. But on\r\nmy mentioning the matter to Mr. Ponsonby by letter, he replies to me\r\n(July 27th) as follows:--\r\n\r\n   \"Maurice Doyle is a son of Richard Doyle, who died in 1876, leaving\r\n    his widow to carry on his farm of 74 acres 1 rood, in the townland\r\n    of Ballykitty, which he held in 1858 at a rental of £50, 11s. In\r\n    1868 this was reduced to £48, 11s. In September 1871 he took in\r\n    addition a farm of 159 acres 2 roods at £130, in Burgen and\r\n    Ballykitty. He afterwards got a lease for thirty-one years of this\r\n    larger farm, with a portion of his earlier holding, for £155. This\r\n    left him to pay £21, 11s. for the residue of the earlier holding as\r\n    in 1858. But at his request, in 1876, the year of his death, I\r\n    reduced this to £17.\r\n\r\n   \"In March 1879, by the death of Mr. Henry Hall, in whose family it\r\n    had been for certainly a century, the Inchiquin farm of 213 acres,\r\n    valued at £258, 10s., came on my hands. This farm was valued in\r\n    1873 by one valuer at £384, 10s., and by another at £390, 10s. In\r\n    an old lease I find that this farm was let at £3 an acre. Mr. Henry\r\n    Hall to the day of his death held it at £306, 7s. 6d., under a\r\n    lease which I made a lease for life. For this farm Mrs. Richard\r\n    Doyle applied, agreeing to take it on a 31 years' lease, at £370 a\r\n    year. I let it to her, and she became the lease-holder, putting in\r\n    her son Maurice Doyle to take charge of it, though not as the\r\n    tenant. He was an active Land Leaguer from the moment he got into\r\n    the place, and in 1886 he was a leader in promoting the Plan of\r\n    Campaign. Proceedings had to be taken against his mother in order\r\n    to eject him, as she was the tenant, not he. I objected to this,\r\n    for I always have had the greatest regard for her. Had she been let\r\n    alone she would have paid her rent as she had always done. But Mr.\r\n    Lane and his allies saw it would never do to let Maurice Doyle\r\n    retain his place on his mother's holding. All this will show you\r\n    that Maurice Doyle did not inherit the Inchiquin farm. The only\r\n    inherited holding of his mother is the farm of 74 acres 1 rood in\r\n    the townland of Ballykitty, held by his father in 1858. I have no\r\n    doubt you saw Doyle at Youghal, by the description you gave me, and\r\n    you remembered his name at once. He was a thickset heavy-looking\r\n    man, florid, with a military moustache, the last time I saw him.\r\n    His mother is one of the 'rack-rented' tenants you hear of, having\r\n    been able in ten years to increase her acreage from 74 acres to 376\r\n    acres, and her rental from £48, 11s. to £542!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to the general effect of all this business upon the tenants, and upon\r\nhimself, Mr. Ponsonby spoke most feelingly. \"The tenants are ruined\r\nwhere they might have been thriving. My means of being useful to them or\r\nto myself are taken away. My charges, though, all remain. I have to pay\r\ntithes for Protestant Church service, of which I can't have the benefit,\r\nthe churches being closed; and the other day I had a notice that any\r\nproperty I had in England would be held liable for quit-rents to the\r\nCrown on my property in Ireland, of which the Government denies me\r\npractically any control or use!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE G2.\r\n\r\nTHE GLENBEHY EVICTION FUND.\r\n\r\n(Vol. ii. p. 12.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the _London Times_ of September 15 appears the following letter from\r\nthe Land Agent whom I saw at Glenbehy, setting forth the effect of this\r\n\"Glenbehy Eviction Fund\" upon the morals of the tenants and the peace of\r\nthe place:--\r\n\r\n    _To the Editor of the Times._\r\n\r\n   \"Sir,--Although nearly eighteen months have elapsed since the\r\n    evictions on the Glenbehy estate, after which the above-named fund\r\n    was started and largely subscribed to by the sympathetic British\r\n    public, I think it only fair to throw a little light on the manner\r\n    in which this fund has been expended, and the effects which are\r\n    still felt in consequence of the money not yet being exhausted.\r\n\r\n   \"It was generally supposed that the tenants then evicted were in\r\n    such poor circumstances as to be unable to settle, whereas, as a\r\n    matter of fact, they were, and are, with a few exceptions, the most\r\n    well-to-do on the estate, having, for the most part, from five to\r\n    fifteen head of cattle, in addition to sheep, pigs, etc.\r\n\r\n   \"Among the tenants evicted at that time many had not paid rents\r\n    since 1879, and had been in illegal occupation since 1884, from\r\n    which latter date the landlord was responsible for taxes, provided\r\n    it is proved that sufficient distress cannot be made of the lands.\r\n    These tenants were offered a clear receipt to May 1, 1886, if they\r\n    paid half a year's rent, which would scarcely have paid the cost of\r\n    proceedings, and the landlord would therefore have been put to\r\n    actual loss. These people, though well able to settle, are given to\r\n    understand that as soon as they do so their participation in the\r\n    eviction fund will cease, and thus it will be seen that a direct\r\n    premium is being paid to dishonesty.\r\n\r\n   \"In one case a widow woman was summoned for being on the farm from\r\n    which she was at that time evicted. Finding out that one of her\r\n    children was ill, I applied to the magistrate at the hearing of the\r\n    case only to impose a nominal fine. In consequence she was fined\r\n    one penny, but sooner than pay this she went to gaol, though she\r\n    had several head of cattle and, prior to her eviction, a very nice\r\n    farm. The case of this woman fairly illustrates the combination\r\n    which has existed to avoid the fulfilment of obligations.\r\n\r\n   \"The amount of fines paid for similar offences comes, in several\r\n    instances, to nearly what I require to effect a settlement. Some of\r\n    the tenants actually wrote to the late agent on this estate begging\r\n    him to evict them in order that they might come in for a share of\r\n    the money raised for the relief of distress, and this clearly shows\r\n    beyond dispute that the well-meaning subscribers to the fund will\r\n    be more or less responsible for any further evictions to which it\r\n    may be necessary to resort. I may mention that the parish priest is\r\n    one of the trustees for the money which is thus being used for the\r\n    purpose of preventing settlements and keeping the place in a\r\n    continual state of turmoil.\r\n\r\n   \"Judge Currane, at the January sessions held at Killarney this\r\n    year, ruled in about fifty ejectment cases on this estate that\r\n    tenants owing one and a half to nine years' rent should pay half a\r\n    year's rent and costs within a week, a quarter of a year's rent by\r\n    June 1, and a quarter of a year's rent by October 1; arrears to be\r\n    cancelled. Some of these, owing to non-compliance with the Judge's\r\n    ruling, may have to be evicted, and their eviction will be what is\r\n    termed the unrooting of peasants' houses and the ejectment of\r\n    overburdened tenants for not paying impossible rents.\r\n\r\n   \"I confess I am at a loss to understand how Mr. Parnell's Arrears\r\n    Act would have improved matters or have averted what one of your\r\n    contemporaries calls a \"painful scandal.\"--I am, Sirs, yours, &c.,\r\n\r\n   \"D.

But a\r\nlittle more than three years ago, for example, the following circular\r\nwas issued by the Bishop of Ossory, and affixed to the door of the\r\nchurches in his diocese. Who can wonder that it should have been\r\nregarded by Protestants in that diocese as a direct stirring up of\r\nbitter religious animosities against them? Or that, emanating directly\r\nas it did from a bishop of the Church, it should be represented as\r\nemanating indirectly from the Head of the Church himself at Rome?\r\n\r\n    \"_Kilkenny, April 16th, 1885._\r\n\r\n    \"REV.

Many\r\n    _evil-disposed_ persons, utterly unmindful of the prohibitions of\r\n    the Church, and regardless of the dreadful consequences they bring\r\n    on themselves, have not hesitated to enter into those _unholy\r\n    matrimonial alliances_ called \"Mixed Marriages,\" which the Catholic\r\n    Church has always _hated and detested_. Those misguided Catholics,\r\n    who do not deserve the name, have not blushed to go, in some\r\n    instances, before the Protestant Minister, in other instances,\r\n    before the Public Registrar, to ask them to assist at their marriage\r\n    with a Protestant. By contracting marriage in this way, they run a\r\n    great risk of bringing on themselves and on their children, should\r\n    they have any, the _maledictions_ of Heaven instead of the blessings\r\n    of religion. In order to put a stop to this growing abuse, and to\r\n    prevent it from spreading like a contagion to other parts of the\r\n    Diocese, we beg to remind the faithful of certain regulations which,\r\n    for the future, shall have force in the Diocese of Ossory in\r\n    reference to the Catholics, who so far forget themselves as to\r\n    contract such marriages.\r\n\r\n    \"1. In the first place, any one who contracts a \"Mixed Marriage\"\r\n    without a dispensation from the Holy See and before a Protestant\r\n    Minister or a Registrar is, by the very fact, guilty of a most\r\n    grievous mortal sin by violating a solemn law of the Church in a\r\n    most grave matter.\r\n\r\n    \"2. The Catholic who assists as witness at such marriage also\r\n    commits a most grievous sin by co-operating in an unlawful act.\r\n\r\n    \"3. Both the Catholic party contracting the marriage and the\r\n    Catholic witnesses to it cannot be absolved by any priest in the\r\n    Diocese of Ossory, unless by the Bishop or by those to whom he\r\n    grants special faculties.\r\n\r\n    \"4. In order more effectually to deter people from entering into\r\n    _those detestable marriages_, the penalty of _Excommunication_\r\n    is hereby attached to that sin both for the Catholic _contracting_\r\n    party as also for the Catholic _witnesses_ to such marriage.\r\n\r\n    \"5. The notice which the Protestant Rector or the Registrar is\r\n    legally bound in such cases to send to the Parish Priest of the\r\n    Catholic party, will be read from the Altar for three consecutive\r\n    Sundays, and thus the _crime_ of the offending party brought out\r\n    into open light before his or her fellow-parishioners.\r\n\r\n    \"6. For the rest, we hope the sense of decency and religion of the\r\n    Catholic people and their Pastors shall be no more hurt by any\r\n    Catholic entering into those marriages, so full of, misery and evil\r\n    of every kind for themselves, their children, and society at\r\n    large.--Yours faithfully in Christ,\r\n\r\n    [Image: Cross] ABRAHAM, Bishop of Ossory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE H.\r\n\r\nTULLY AND THE WOODFORD EVICTIONS.\r\n\r\n(Vol. ii. p. 149.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the first edition of this book was published certain \"evictions\"\r\nmentioned in it as impending on the Clanricarde estates have been\r\ncarried out. I have no reason to suppose that there was more or less\r\nreason for carrying out these evictions than there usually is, not in\r\nIreland only, but all over the civilised world, for a resort by the\r\nlegal owners of property to legal means of recovering the possession of\r\nit from persons who fail to comply with the terms on which it was put\r\ninto their keeping. Whether this failure results from dishonesty or from\r\nmisfortune is a consideration not often allowed, I think, to affect the\r\nright of the legal owner of the property concerned to his legal remedy\r\nin any other country but Ireland, nor even in Ireland in the case of any\r\nproperty other than property in land. But as what I learned on the spot\r\ntouching the general condition of the Clanricarde tenants, and touching\r\nthe conduct and character of Lord Clanricarde's agent, Mr. Tener, led me\r\nto take a special interest in these evictions, I asked him to send me\r\nsome account of them. In reply he gave me a number of interesting\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\nThe only serious attempt at resisting the execution of the law was made\r\nby \"Dr.\" Tully, one of the leading local \"agitators,\" to the tendency of\r\nwhose harangues judicial reference was made during the investigation\r\ninto the case of Mr. Wilfrid Blunt. Tully had a holding of seventeen\r\nacres at a rent of £2, 10s., the Government valuation being £4. He\r\nearned a good livelihood as a boat-builder, and he had put up a slated\r\nhouse on his holding. But in November 1884 he chose to stop paying the\r\nvery low rent at which he held his place, and he has paid no rent since\r\nthat time. As is stated in a footnote on page 153, vol. ii. of this\r\nbook, a decree was granted against Tully by Judge Henn for three years'\r\nrent due in May 1887, and his equity of redemption having expired July\r\n9, 1888, this recourse was had to the law against him.\r\n\r\nAs the leading spirit of the agitation, Tully had put a garrison into\r\nhis house of twelve men and two women. He had dug a ditch around it,\r\ntaken out the window-sashes, filled up the casements and the doorways\r\nwith stones and trunks of trees. Portholes had been pierced under the\r\nroof, through which the defenders might thrust red-hot pikes,\r\npitchforks, and other weapons, and empty pails of boiling water upon the\r\nassailants. A brief parley took place. Tully refused to make any offer\r\nof a settlement unless the agent would agree to reinstate all the\r\nevicted tenants, to which Mr. Tener replied that he would recognise no\r\n\"combination,\" but was ready to deal with every tenant fairly and\r\nindividually. Finally the Sheriff ordered his men to take the place.\r\nLadders were planted, and while some of the constables, under the\r\nprotection of a shield covered with zinc, a sort of Roman _testudo_,\r\nworked at removing the earthern ramparts, others nimbly climbed to the\r\nroof and began to break in from above. In their excitement the garrison\r\nhelped this forward by breaking holes through the roof themselves to get\r\nat the attacking party, and in about twenty minutes the fortress was\r\ncaptured, and the inmates were prisoners. Two constables were burned by\r\nthe red-hot pikes, the gun of another was broken to pieces by a huge\r\nstone, and a fourth was slightly wounded by a fork. One of the defenders\r\ngot a sword-cut; and Tully was brought forth as one too severely wounded\r\nto walk. Upon investigation, however, the surgeon refused to certify\r\nthat he was unable to undergo the ordinary imprisonment in such cases\r\nmade and provided.\r\n\r\nThe collapse of the resistance at this central point was followed by a\r\ngeneral surrender.\r\n\r\nAfter the capture of Tully's house, Mr. Tener writes to me, \"I found it\r\nbeing gutted by his family, who would have carried it away piecemeal.\r\nThey had already taken away the flooring of one of the rooms.\" Thereupon\r\nMr. Tener had the house pulled down, with the result of seeing a\r\nstatement made in a leading Nationalist paper that he was \"evicting the\r\ntenants and pulling down their houses.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday,\" Mr. Tener writes to me on the 9th of September, \"I walked\r\ntwenty-five miles, visiting thirty farms about Portumna. Except in two\r\nor three cases, the tenants have ample means, and part of the live stock\r\nalone on the farms, exclusive of the crops, would suffice to pay all the\r\nrents I had demanded. On the farms recently 'evicted,' I found treble\r\nthe amount of the rent due in live stock alone.\"\r\n\r\nAs to one case of these recent evictions, I found it stated in an Irish\r\njournal that a young man, who had been ill of consumption for two years,\r\nthe son of a tenant, was removed from the house, the local physician\r\nrefusing to certify that he was unfit for removal, and that he died a\r\nfew days afterwards. The implication was obvious, and I asked Mr. Tener\r\nfor the facts.\r\n\r\nHe replied, \"This young man, John Fahey, was in consumption, but did not\r\nappear to be in any danger. Dr. Carte, an Army surgeon, examined him,\r\nand said there was no immediate danger. The day was fine and he walked\r\nabout wrapped in a comfortable coat, and talked with me and others. His\r\nfather, a respectable man, made no attempt to defend his house; and at\r\nhis request, after the crowd had gone away, my man in charge permitted\r\nthe invalid and the family to reoccupy the house temporarily because of\r\nhis illness. There was no inquest, and no need of any, after his death.\r\nHis father, Patrick Fahey, had means to pay, but told me he 'could not,'\r\nwhich meant he 'dared not.' I went to him personally twice, and sent him\r\nmany messages. But the terror of the League was upon the poor man.\r\n\r\n\"An interesting case is that of Michael Fahey, of Dooras. In 1883 his\r\nrent was judicially reduced about 5 per cent., from £33 to £31, 5s. His\r\nhouse and all about it is substantial and comfortable. His father, about\r\nthirty years ago, fought for a whole night and bravely beat off a party\r\nof 'Terry-Alts,' the 'Moonlighters' of that day. For his courage the\r\nGovernment presented him with a gun, of which the son is very proud.\r\nPity he did not inherit the pluck with the gun of his parent!\r\n\r\n\"I had been privately told that this tenant would pay; but that he would\r\nfirst produce a doctor's certificate that his old mother could not be\r\nmoved. He did give the Sheriff a carefully worded document to show this,\r\nbut it was so vague that I objected to its being received by the\r\nSheriff. Upon this (not before! mark the craft of even a well-disposed\r\nIrish tenant in those evil days), I was asked to go into the house. I\r\nwent in and entered the parlour. There the tenant told me he would pay\r\nthe year's rent and the costs, amounting to £50. He had risen from his\r\nseat to fetch the money, when, lo! Father Egan (the priest upon whose\r\nhead the widow of the murdered Finlay called down the curse of God in\r\nthe open street of Woodford) appeared in the doorway. He had come in on\r\na pretence of seeing the old mother of the tenant, who had (for that\r\noccasion) taken to her bed. The bedroom lay beyond the parlour, and was\r\nentered from it. The tenant actually shook with fear as Father Egan\r\npassed through, and I thought all hope of a settlement gone, when\r\nsuddenly the officer of the police came in, passed into the bedroom, and\r\ntold Father Egan he must withdraw. This Father Egan refused to do,\r\nwhereupon the officer said very quietly, 'I shall remove you forthwith\r\nif you do not go out quietly.' Upon this Father Egan hastily left. The\r\ntenant then went into the bedroom and soon reappeared with the £50 in\r\nbank-notes, which he paid me. All this was dramatic enough. But the\r\ncomedy was next performed in front of the house, where all could see it,\r\nof handing to the Sheriff the alleged doctor's certificate, and of my\r\nsaying aloud that 'in the circumstances' I had no objection to his\r\nreceiving it! After this all the forces proceeded to take their luncheon\r\non the green bank sloping down to the Shannon in front of the\r\nfarm-house. There is a fine orchard on the place, and it recalled to me\r\nsome of the farms I saw in Virginia.\r\n\r\n\"I had gone into the house again, and was standing near the fire in the\r\nkitchen, where some of my escort were taking their luncheon. It is a\r\nlarge kitchen, and perhaps a dozen people were in it, when in came\r\nFather Egan again and called to the tenant Fahey, 'Put out those\r\npolicemen, and do not suffer one of them to remain.'\r\n\r\n\"The sergeant instantly said, 'We are here on duty, Father Egan, and if\r\nyou dare to try to intimidate this tenant, I shall either put you out or\r\narrest you.'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes,' I interposed, looking at the sergeant, 'you are certainly here\r\non duty, and in the name of the law, and it is sad to see a clergyman\r\nhere in the interest of an illegal, criminal, and rebellious movement,\r\nand of the immoral Plan of Campaign.'\r\n\r\n\"'Oh!' exclaimed Father Egan, 'the opinion of the agent of the Marquis\r\nof Clanricarde is valuable, truly!'\r\n\r\n\"'I give you,' I said, 'not my opinion, but the opinion of Dr. Healy and\r\nDr. O'Dwyer, bishops of your Church, and men worthy of all respect and\r\nreverence. And I am sorry to know that some ecclesiastics deserve no\r\nrespect, but that at their doors lies the main responsibility for the\r\nmisery and the crime which afflict our unhappy country. I feel sure a\r\njust God will punish them in due time.'\r\n\r\n\"Father Egan made no reply, but paused a moment, and then walked out of\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\n\"At the next house, that of Dennis Fahey, we found a still better\r\ndwelling. Here we had another mock certificate, but we received the rent\r\nwith the costs.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE H2.\r\n\r\nBOYCOTTING THE DEAD.\r\n\r\n(Vol. ii. p. 151.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following official account sent to me (July 24) of an affair in\r\nDonegal, the result of the gospel of \"Boycotting\" taught in that region,\r\nneeds and will bear no comment.\r\n\r\nPatrick Cavanagh came to reside at Clonmany, County Donegal, about two\r\nmonths ago, as caretaker on some evicted farms. He died on Wednesday\r\nevening, June 20th, having received the full rites of the Roman Catholic\r\nChurch. The people had displayed no ill-will towards him during his\r\nbrief residence at Clonmany, and on the evening of his death his body\r\nwas washed and laid out by some women. On Thursday two townsmen dug his\r\ngrave, where pointed out by Father Doherty, P.P.\r\n\r\nThe first symptom of change of feeling was that on Thursday every\r\ncarpenter applied to had some excuse for not making a coffin for the\r\nbody of deceased. On Friday morning the grave was found to be filled\r\nwith stones, and a deputation waited on Father Doherty to protest\r\nagainst Cavanagh's burial in the chapel graveyard. He told them to go\r\nhome and mind their business. About 10.30 A.M. on Friday the chapel bell\r\nwas rung--not tolled or rung as for service, but faster. The local\r\nsergeant of police went to the cemetery; when he arrived there the\r\ntolling ceased. He then went to Father Doherty, who told those present\r\nthat their conduct was such as to render them unfit for residence\r\nanywhere but in a savage country. He told them to go to their homes, and\r\nadvised them to allow the corpse to be buried in the grave he had marked\r\nout. After Father Doherty had left, the people condemned his\r\ninterference, and said they would not allow any stranger to be buried in\r\nthe graveyard. When Constable Brady put it to those present that their\r\nreal objection did not lie in the fact that Cavanagh had been a\r\nstranger, he was not contradicted.\r\n\r\nThe body was ultimately buried at Carndonagh on Saturday, several people\r\nremaining in the graveyard at Clonmany all through the night (Friday)\r\ntill the body was taken to Carndonagh for burial.\r\n\r\nAt Carndonagh Petty Sessions, on the 18th July 1888, Con. Doherty and\r\nOwen Doherty, with five others, were prosecuted for unlawful assembly on\r\nthe occasion above referred to. The first two named, who were the\r\nringleaders, were convicted, and sentenced to six weeks' imprisonment\r\neach with hard labour; the charges against the remainder were dismissed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE I.\r\n\r\nPOST-OFFICE SAVINGS BANKS.\r\n\r\n(Vol. i. p. 117; vol. ii. pp. 5, 12, 66, 95, 200, 248.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the Post-Office Savings Banks represent the smaller depositors, and\r\ncommand special confidence among them even in the disturbed districts, I\r\nprint here an official statement showing the balances due to depositors\r\nin the undermentioned offices, situated in certain of the most disturbed\r\nregions I visited, on the 31st December of the years 1880 and 1887\r\nrespectively:--\r\n\r\n    +-----------------+-----------------+---------------+\r\n    |    OFFICE.      |      1880.      |     1887.     |\r\n    +-----------------+-----------------+---------------+\r\n    |                 |      £   s. d.  |    £   s. d.  |\r\n    |  Bunbeg,        |    1,270  6  7  |  1,206 18  2  |\r\n    |  Falcarragh,    |       62 15 10  |    494 10  8  |\r\n    |  Gorey,         |    3,690 14  4  |  5,099  5  7  |\r\n    |  Inch,          |[A]     8 11  0  |    209  7  5  |\r\n    |  Killorglin,    |      282 15  9  |  1,299  2  6  |\r\n    |  Loughrea,      |    5,500 19  9  |  6,311  4 11  |\r\n    |  Mitchelstown,  |    1,387 13  2  |  2,846  9  3  |\r\n    |  Portumna,      |    2,539 10 11  |  3,376  5  4  |\r\n    |  Sixmilebridge, |      382 17 10  |    934 13  4  |\r\n    |  Stradbally,    |    1,812 14  8  |  2,178 18  2  |\r\n    |  Woodford,      |      259 14  6  |  1,350 17 11  |\r\n    |  Youghal,       |    3,031  0  7  |  7,038  7  2  |\r\n    +-----------------+-----------------+---------------+\r\n    [A] This Office was not opened for Savings Bank\r\n        business until the year 1881, the amount shown\r\n        being balance due on the 31st December 1882.\r\n\r\nIt appears from this table that the deposits in these Savings Banks\r\nincreased in the aggregate from £20,329, 15s. 11d. in 1880 to £32,347,\r\n9s. 7d. in 1887, or almost 60 per cent, in seven years.

P. O'Neill in the chair,\r\nwas held at Coolgreany on the Sunday previous to the 15th December 1886,\r\nthe date on which the \"Plan of Campaign\" was adopted on the estate, at\r\nwhich it was resolved that if I refused the terms offered they would\r\njoin the \"Plan.\"\r\n\r\nI had no conference at Freeman's house or anywhere else at any time with\r\ntwo parish priests. On the 15th December 1886, when seated in Freeman's\r\nhouse waiting to receive the rents, four priests, a reporter of the\r\n_Freeman's Journal_, some local reporters, and four of the tenants\r\nrushed into the room; and the priests in the rudest possible manner (the\r\nRev. P. Farrelly, one of them, calling me \"Francy Hyne's hangman,\" and\r\nother terms of abuse) informed me that unless I re-instated a former\r\nRoman Catholic tenant in a farm which he had previously held, and which\r\nwas then let to a Protestant, and gave an abatement of 30 per cent., no\r\nrent would be paid _me_ that day. Dr. Dillon, C.C., was not present on\r\nthis occasion, or, if so, I do not remember seeing him.\r\n\r\nOn my asking if I had no alternative but to concede to their demand, the\r\nRev. Mr. Dunphy, parish priest, replied, \"None other; do not think, sir,\r\nwe have come here to-day to do honour to you.\"\r\n\r\nThe Rev. P. O'Neill spoke as he always does, in a more gentlemanly and\r\nconciliatory manner, and I therefore, as the confusion in the room was\r\ngreat, offered to discuss the matter with him, the Rev. O'Donel, C.C.,\r\nand the tenants, if the other priests, who were strangers to me, and the\r\nreporters would leave the room. This the Rev. Mr. Dunphy declared they\r\nwould not do, and I accordingly refused further to discuss the matter.\r\n\r\nAfter they left the house, one of the tenants, Mick Darcy, stepped\r\nforward and said, \"Settle with us, Captain.\" I replied, \"Certainly, if\r\nyou come back with me into the house.\" The Rev. Mr. Dunphy took him by\r\nthe collar of his coat and threw him against the wall of the house, then\r\nturning to me with his hand raised said, \"You shall not do so; we, who\r\nclaim the temporal as well as spiritual power over _you_ as well as\r\nthese poor creatures, will settle this matter with you.\"\r\n\r\nThe tenants were then taken down to the League rooms, where two M.P.s,\r\nSir Thomas Esmonde and Mr. Mayne, were waiting to receive the rents,\r\nwhich, one by one, they were ordered in to pay into the war-chest of the\r\n\"Plan of Campaign.\"\r\n\r\nI have I fear written too much of this commencement of the war on the\r\nestate which has since led to over seventy of the tenants and their\r\nfamilies being ejected, and has brought ruin on nearly all who joined\r\nit. I have considerable experience as a land agent, but I know of no\r\nestate where the tenants were more respectable, better housed, or, as a\r\nbody, in better circumstances than on the Brooke estate. They had a\r\nkind, indulgent landlord, and they knew it; and nothing but the belief\r\nthat, led by their clergy, they were foremost in a battle fighting for\r\ntheir country and religion, would have induced them to put up with the\r\ngreat hardships and loss they have undoubtedly had to suffer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE L.\r\n\r\nA DUCAL SUPPER IN IRELAND IN 1711.\r\n\r\n(Vol. ii. p. 283.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following entry I take from the Expense-Book of the Duke of Ormond,\r\nunder date of August 23, 1711:--\r\n\r\nHis Grace came to Kilkenny, half an hour after 10 at night.\r\n\r\nHIS GRACE'S TABLE.\r\n\r\nPottage.

O'LEARY.\r\n\r\n(Vol. ii. p. 291.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the first edition of this book I credited Mr. O'Leary with making\r\nthis pungent remark about figs and grapes, because I found it jotted\r\ndown in my original memoranda as coming from him. In a private note he\r\nassures me that he does not think it was made by him, and though this\r\ndoes not agree with my own recollection, I defer, of course, to his\r\nimpression. And this I do the more readily that it affords me an\r\nopportunity for printing the following very characteristic and\r\ninteresting letter sent to me by him for publication should I think fit\r\nto use it.\r\n\r\nAs the most important support given by the Irish in America to the\r\nNationalists is solicited by their agents on the express ground that\r\nthey are really labouring to establish an Irish Republic, this outspoken\r\ndeclaration of Mr. O'Leary, that he does not believe they \"expect or\r\ndesire\" the establishment of an Irish Republic, will be of interest on\r\nmy side of the water:--\r\n\r\n   \"DUBLIN, _Sept._ 9, '88.\r\n\r\n   \"My Dear Sir,--I am giving more bother about what you make me say\r\n    in your book than the thing is probably worth, especially seeing\r\n    that what you say about me and my present attitude towards men and\r\n    things here is almost entirely correct.\r\n\r\n   \"It is proverbially hard to prove a negative, and my main reason\r\n    for believing I did not say the thing about figs and grapes is that\r\n    I never could remember the whole of any proverb in conversation;\r\n    but I am absolutely certain I never said that 'some of them (the\r\n    National Leaguers) expect to found an Irish republic on robbery,\r\n    and to administer it by falsehood. We don't.' Most certainly I do\r\n    not expect to found anything on robbery, or administer anything by\r\n    falsehood, but I do not in the least believe that the National\r\n    League either expects or desires to found an Irish republic at all!\r\n    Neither do I believe that the Leaguers will long retain the\r\n    administration of such small measure of Home Rule, as I now (since\r\n    the late utterances of Mr. Parnell and Mr. Gladstone) believe we\r\n    are going to get. My fault with the present people is not that they\r\n    are looking, or mean to look, for too much, but that they may be\r\n    induced, by pressure from their English Radical allies, to be\r\n    content with too little. It is only a large and liberal measure of\r\n    Home Rule which will ever satisfy the Irish people, and I fear\r\n    that, if the smaller fry of Radical M.P.'s are allowed to have a\r\n    strong voice in a matter of which they know next to nothing, the\r\n    settlement of the Irish question will be indefinitely postponed.--I\r\n    remain, faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n   \"JOHN O'LEARY.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE N\r\n\r\nBOYCOTTING PRIVATE OPINION.\r\n\r\n(Vol. ii. p. 293.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis case of Mr. Taylor is worth preserving _in extenso_ as an\r\nillustration of that spirit in the Irish journalism of the day, against\r\nwhich Mr. Rolleston and his friends protest as fatal to independence,\r\nmanliness, and truth. I simply cite the original attack made upon Mr.\r\nTaylor, the replies made by himself and his friends, and the comments\r\nmade upon those replies by the journal which assailed him. They all tell\r\ntheir own story.\r\n\r\n    (_UNITED IRELAND_, JUNE 16.)\r\n\r\n    Mr. John F. Taylor owes everything he has or is to the Irish\r\n    National Party; nor is he slow to confess it where the\r\n    acknowledgment will serve his personal interests. His sneers are\r\n    all anonymous, and, like Mr. Fagg, the grateful and deferential\r\n    valet in _The Rivals_, \"it hurts his conscience to be found out.\"\r\n    There is no honesty or sincerity in the man. His covert gibes are\r\n    the spiteful emanation of personal disappointment; his lofty\r\n    morality is a cloak for unscrupulous self-seeking. He has always\r\n    shown himself ready to say anything or do anything that may serve\r\n    his own interests. In the general election of 1885 he made frantic\r\n    efforts to get into Parliament as a member of the Irish Party. He\r\n    ghosted every member of the party whose influence he thought might\r\n    help him--notably the two men, Mr. Dillon and Mr. O'Brien, at whom\r\n    he now sneers, as he fondly believes, in the safe seclusion of an\r\n    anonymous letter of an English newspaper. During the period of\r\n    probation his hand was incessant on Mr. Dillon's door-knocker. The\r\n    most earnest supplications were not spared. All in vain. Either his\r\n    character or his ability failed to satisfy the Irish leader, and\r\n    his claim was summarily rejected. Since then his wounded vanity has\r\n    found vent in spiteful calumny of almost every member of the Irish\r\n    Party--whenever he found malice a luxury that could be safely\r\n    indulged in.\r\n\r\n   \"His next step was a startling one. We have absolute reason to\r\n    know, when the last Coercion Act was in full swing, this\r\n    pure-souled and disinterested patriot begged for, received, and\r\n    accepted a very petty Crown Prosecutorship under a Coercion\r\n    Government. As was wittily said at the time, he sold his\r\n    principles, not for a mess of pottage, but for the stick that\r\n    stirred the mess. Strong pressure was brought to bear on him, and\r\n    he was induced for his own sake, after many protests and with much\r\n    reluctance, to publicly refuse the office he had already privately\r\n    accepted. Mr. Taylor professes to model himself on Robert Emmet and\r\n    Thomas Davis; it is hard to realise Thomas Davis or Robert Emmet as\r\n    a Coercion Crown Prosecutor in the pay of Dublin Castle. Since then\r\n    there has been no more persistent caviller at the Irish policy and\r\n    the Irish Party in company where he believed such cavilling paid.\r\n    When Home Rule was proposed by Mr. Gladstone, he had a thousand\r\n    foolish sneers for the measure and its author. When the Bill was\r\n    defeated, he elected Mr. Chamberlain, Mr. Goschen, and Mr. T.W.\r\n    Russell as the gods of his idolatry. Such a nature needs a patron,\r\n    and Mr. Webb, Q.C., the Tory County Court Judge who doubled the\r\n    sentence on Father M'Fadden, was the patron to be selected. It is\r\n    shrewdly suspected that he supplied most of the misguiding\r\n    information for Dr. Webb's coercion pamphlet, and it is probable\r\n    that Dr. Webb gives him a lift with his weekly letter to the\r\n    _Manchester Guardian._\r\n\r\n\r\n    (_UNITED IRELAND_, JUNE 23.)\r\n\r\n    MR. JOHN F. TAYLOR.\r\n\r\n    _To the Editor of \"United Ireland.\"_\r\n\r\n    Sir,--You would not, I am sure, allow intentional misstatements to\r\n    appear in your columns, and I ask you to allow me space to correct\r\n    three erroneous observations made about myself in your current\r\n    issue--\r\n\r\n    1. The first statement is to the effect that I owe everything I\r\n    have, or that I am, to the Irish National Party. I owe absolutely\r\n    nothing to the Irish Party, except an attempt to boycott me on my\r\n    circuit, which, fortunately for me, has failed.\r\n\r\n    2. The second is to the effect that I made \"frantic efforts\" (these\r\n    are the words, I think) to enter Parliament, and besieged Mr.\r\n    Dillon's house during the time when candidates were being chosen. I\r\n    saw Mr. Dillon exactly twice, both occasions at Mr. Davitt's\r\n    request. Mr. Davitt urged me to allow my name to go forward as a\r\n    candidate, and it was at his wish and solicitation that I saw Mr.\r\n    Dillon.\r\n\r\n    3. It is further said that I begged a Crown Prosecutorship.\r\n    Fortunately, Mr. Walker and The M'Dermot are living men, and they\r\n    know this to be absolutely untrue. I was offered such an\r\n    appointment, and, contrary to my own judgment, I allowed myself to\r\n    be guided by Mr. Davitt, who thought the matter would be\r\n    misunderstood in the state of things then existing. I believe I am\r\n    the only person that ever declined such an offer.\r\n\r\n    As to general statements, these are of no importance, and I shall\r\n    not trouble you about them.--Yours very truly,\r\n\r\n    JOHN F. TAYLOR.\r\n\r\n    _P.S._--The introduction of Dr. Webb's name was a gratuitous\r\n    outrage, Dr. Webb and I never assisted each other in anything\r\n    except in the defence of P.N. Fitzgerald. J.F.T.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To the Editor of \"United Ireland.\"_\r\n\r\n    Dear Sir,--As my name has been introduced into the controversy\r\n    between yourself and Mr. Taylor, I feel called upon to substantiate\r\n    the two statements wherein my name occurs in Mr. Taylor's letter of\r\n    last week. It was at my request that he called upon Mr. John\r\n    Dillon, M.P. I think I accompanied him on the occasion, and unless\r\n    my memory is very much at fault, Mr. Dillon was not unfriendly to\r\n    Mr. Taylor's proposed candidature. This visit occurred some three\r\n    months after Mr. Taylor had, on my advice, declined the Crown\r\n    Prosecutorship for King's County, a post afterwards applied for by\r\n    and granted to a near relative of one of the most prominent members\r\n    of the Irish Party. With Mr. Taylor's general views on the present\r\n    situation, or opinions upon parties or men, I have no concern. But,\r\n    in so far as the circumstances related above are dealt with in your\r\n    issue of last week, I think an unjust imputation has been made\r\n    against him, and in the interests of truth and fair play I feel\r\n    called upon to adduce the testimony of facts as they\r\n    occurred.--Yours truly,\r\n\r\n    MICHAEL DAVITT.\r\n\r\n    Ballybrack, Co. Dublin,\r\n\r\n    June 19, 1888.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To the Editor of \"United Ireland.\"_\r\n\r\n    Sir,--As this is, I believe, the first time I have sought to\r\n    intrude upon your columns, I hope you will allow me some slight\r\n    space in the interests of fair-play and freedom of speech. Those\r\n    interests seem to me to have been quite set at naught in the\r\n    attack, or rather series of attacks, upon Mr. Taylor in your last\r\n    issue. Mr. Taylor's views upon many matters are not mine. He is far\r\n    more democratic in his opinions than I see any sufficient reason\r\n    for being, and he is very much more of what is called a land\r\n    reformer than I am; but on an acquaintance of some years I have\r\n    ever found him an honourable and high-minded gentleman, and as good\r\n    a Nationalist, from my point of view, as most of the members of the\r\n    Irish Parliamentary Party whom I either know or know of. Of some of\r\n    the charges made against Mr. Taylor, such as the seeking for Crown\r\n    Prosecutorships and the like, I am in no position to speak, save\r\n    from my knowledge of his character, but I understand Mr. Davitt\r\n    knows all about these things, and I suppose he will tell what he\r\n    knows. But of the main matter, and I think the chief cause of your\r\n    ire, I am quite in a position to speak. I have read at least a\r\n    score of Mr. Taylor's letters to the _Manchester Guardian_, and I\r\n    have always found them very intelligently written, and invariably\r\n    characterised by a spirit of fairness and moderation; indeed, the\r\n    chief fault I found with them was that they took too favourable a\r\n    view of the motives, if not the acts, of many of our public men,\r\n    but notably of Messrs. Dillon and O'Brien. You may, of course,\r\n    fairly say that I am not the best judge of either the acts or the\r\n    motives of these gentlemen, and I freely grant you that I may not,\r\n    for my way of looking upon the Irish question is quite other than\r\n    theirs; but what I must be excused for holding is that both I and\r\n    Mr. Taylor have quite as good a right to our opinions as either of\r\n    these gentlemen, or as any other member of the Irish Parliamentary\r\n    Party. But this is the very last right that people are inclined to\r\n    grant to each other in Ireland just now. Personally I care very\r\n    little for this, but for Ireland's sake I care much. Some twenty\r\n    years ago or so I was sent into penal servitude with the almost\r\n    entire approval, expressed or implied, of the Irish Press. Some\r\n    short time after the same Press found out that I and my friends had\r\n    not sinned so grievously in striving to free Ireland. But men and\r\n    times and things may change again, and, though I am growing old, I\r\n    hope still to live long enough to be forgiven for my imperfect\r\n    appreciation of the blessings of Boycotting, and the Plan of\r\n    Campaign, and many similar blessings. It matters little indeed how\r\n    or when I die, so that Ireland lives, but her life can only be a\r\n    living death if Irishmen are not free to say what they believe, and\r\n    to act as they deem right.--Your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n    JOHN O'LEARY.\r\n\r\n    June 18, 1888.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To the Editor of \"United Ireland.\"_\r\n\r\n    Dear Sir,--I observe that in your last issue, amongst other things,\r\n    you state that Mr. Taylor accepted a Crown Prosecutorship in 1885.\r\n    I happen to know the precise facts. Mr. Taylor was offered the\r\n    Crown Prosecutorship of the King's County, and some of us strongly\r\n    advised him to accept it. There were no political prosecutions\r\n    impending at the time, and it seemed to me that a Nationalist who\r\n    would do his work honestly in prosecuting offenders against the\r\n    ordinary law might strike a blow against tyranny by refusing to\r\n    accept a brief, if offered, against men accused of political\r\n    offences or prosecuted under a Coercion Act. I know that a similar\r\n    view was entertained by the late Very Rev. Dr. Kavanagh of Kildare,\r\n    and many others. However, we failed to influence Mr. Taylor further\r\n    than to make him say that he would do nothing in the matter until\r\n    Mr. Davitt was consulted. I, for one, called on Mr. Davitt, and\r\n    pressed my views upon him; but he was decided that no Nationalist\r\n    could identify himself in the smallest way with Castle rule in\r\n    Ireland. This settled the question, and Mr. Taylor declined the\r\n    post, which was subsequently applied for by Mr. Luke Dillon, who\r\n    now holds it.--Faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n    JAMES A. POOLE.\r\n\r\n    29 Harcourt Street.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    EDITORIAL NOTE.\r\n\r\n    _\"United Ireland,\" June 23._\r\n\r\n    We devote a large portion of our space to-day to the apparently\r\n    organised defence of Mr. J.F. Taylor and his friends, and we are\r\n    quite content to rest upon their letters the justification for our\r\n    comments. When a gentleman who avows himself a disappointed\r\n    aspirant for Parliamentary honours, and who owns his regret that he\r\n    did not become a petty Castle placeman, is discovered writing in an\r\n    important English Liberal paper, venomous little innuendos at the\r\n    expense of sorely attacked Irish leaders which excite the\r\n    enthusiasm of the _Liarish Times_, it was high time to intimate to\r\n    the _Manchester Guardian_ the source from which its Irish\r\n    information is derived. The case against Mr. Taylor as a\r\n    criticaster is clinched by the fact that his cause is espoused by\r\n    Mr. John O'Leary. The Irish public are a little weary of Mr.\r\n    O'Leary's querulous complaints as an _homme incompris_. So far as\r\n    we are aware, the only ground he himself has for complaining of\r\n    want of toleration is that he possibly considers the good-humoured\r\n    toleration for years invariably extended to his opinions on men and\r\n    things savours of neglect. His idea of toleration with respect to\r\n    others seems to be toleration for everybody except the unhappy\r\n    wretches who may happen to be for the moment doing any practicable\r\n    service in the Irish cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE O.\r\n\r\nBOYCOTTING BY \"CROWNER'S QUEST LAW.\"\r\n\r\n(Vol. ii. p. 312.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following circumstantial account of this deplorable case of Ellen\r\nGaffney preserved here, as I find it printed in the _Irish Times_ of\r\nFebruary 27, 1888.\r\n\r\n\"In the Court of Queen's Bench, on Saturday, the Lord Chief-Justice (Sir\r\nMichael Morris, Bart.), Mr. Justice O'Brien, Mr. Justice Murphy, and Mr.\r\nJustice Gibson presiding, judgment was delivered in the case of Ellen\r\nGaffney. The original motion was to quash the verdict of a coroner's\r\njury held at Philipstown on August 27th and September 1st last, on the\r\nbody of a child named Mary Anne Gaffney.\r\n\r\n\"The Lord Chief-Justice said it appeared that Mary Anne Gaffney, the\r\nchild on whose body the inquest was held, was born on the 23d July, and\r\nthat she died on the 25th August, 1887. A Dr. Clarke, who had been very\r\nmuch referred to in the course of the proceedings, called upon the local\r\nsergeant of the police, and directed his attention to the body, but the\r\nsergeant having inspected the body, came to the conclusion that there\r\nwas no need for an inquest. The doctor considered differently, and the\r\nsergeant communicated with the Coroner on the 26th August, and on the\r\nnext day that gentleman arrived in Philipstown. He had a conference\r\nthere with Dr. Clarke and with a reverend gentleman named Father Bergin,\r\nand subsequently proceeded to hold an inquest upon the child in a\r\npublic-house--a most appropriate place apparently for the transactions\r\nwhich afterwards occurred there. The investigation, if it might be so\r\ncalled, was proceeded with upon that 27th of August. Very strong\r\naffidavits had been made on the part of Mrs. Gaffney--who applied to\r\nhave the inquisition quashed--her husband, and some of the constabulary\r\nauthorities as to the line of conduct pursued upon that occasion. Ellen\r\nGaffney and her husband were taken into custody on the day the inquest\r\nopened by the verbal direction of the Coroner, who refused to complete\r\nthe depositions given by the former on the ground that she was not\r\nsworn. That did not take him out of the difficulty, for if she was not\r\nsworn she had a right to be sworn, and the Coroner had no right to\r\nprevent her. The inquest was resumed on the 1st September in the\r\ncourt-house at Philipstown--the proper place--and a curious letter was\r\nread from the Coroner, the effect of which was that he did not consider\r\nthat there was any ground for detaining the man Gaffney in custody, but\r\nthe woman was brought before a justice of the peace and committed for\r\ntrial. She was in prison from August 27th until the month of December,\r\nwhen the lucky accident of a winter assize occurred, else she might be\r\nthere still. At the adjourned inquest the Coroner proceeded to read over\r\nthe depositions taken on the former day, and it was sworn by four\r\nwitnesses, whom he (the Lord Chief-Justice) entirely credited, that the\r\nCoroner read these depositions as if they were originals, whereas an\r\nunprecedented transaction had occurred. The Coroner had given the\r\noriginal depositions out of his own custody, and given them to a\r\nreverend gentleman who was rather careless of them, as was shown by the\r\nevidence of a witness named Greene, who deposed that he saw a car on the\r\nroad upon which sat two clergymen, and he found on the road the original\r\ndepositions which, presumably, one of the clergymen had dropped. The\r\ndepositions were handed to a magistrate and afterwards returned to the\r\npolice at Philipstown, who had possession of them on the resumption of\r\nthe inquest. If the case stood alone there it was difficult to\r\nunderstand how a Coroner could come into court and appear by counsel to\r\nresist the quashing of an inquisition in regard to which at the very\r\ndoor such gross personal misconduct was demonstrated. No doubt, he said,\r\nhe did not read them as originals but as copies, and it was strange,\r\nthat being so, that he did not inform the jury of what had become of\r\nthem, and he complained now of not being told by the police of their\r\nrecovery--not told of his own misconduct. On the 1st September, Ellen\r\nGaffney applied by a solicitor--Mr. Disdall, and as a set-off the\r\nCoroner permitted a gentleman named O'Kearney Whyte to appear--for whom?\r\nWas it for the constituted authorities or for the next-of-kin? No, but\r\nfor the Rev. Father Bergin, who was described as president of the local\r\nbranch of the National League, and the Coroner (Mr. Gowing) alleged as\r\nthe reason why he allowed him to appear and cross-examine the witnesses\r\nand address the jury and give him the right of reply like Crown counsel\r\nwas, that Ellen Gaffney stated that she had been so much annoyed by\r\nFather Bergin that she attributed the loss of her child to him--that it\r\nwas he who had murdered the child. It was asserted that Father Bergin\r\nsat on the bench with the Coroner and interfered during the conduct of\r\nthe inquest, and having to give some explanation of that Mr. Gowing's\r\nversion was certainly a most amusing one. He said it was the habit to\r\ninvite to a seat on the bench people of a respectable position in\r\nlife--which, of course, a clergyman should be in--and that he asked\r\nFather Bergin to sit beside him in that capacity. But see the dilemma\r\nthe Coroner put himself in. According to his own statement he had\r\npreviously allowed this reverend gentleman to interfere, and to be\r\nrepresented by a solicitor because he was incriminated, inculpated, or\r\naccused, and it certainly was not customary to invite any one so\r\nsituated to occupy a seat on the bench. He (the Lord Chief Baron) did\r\nnot believe that Father Bergin was incriminated in any way, but that was\r\nthe Coroner's allegation, and such was his peculiar action thereafter.\r\nThe Coroner further stated that no matter whether he read the originals\r\nor the copies of the first day's depositions, it was on the evidence of\r\nSeptember 1st that the jury acted. If that was so he placed himself in a\r\nfurther dilemma, for there was no evidence before the jury at all on the\r\nsecond day upon which they could bring a verdict against Ellen Gaffney.\r\nIn regard to the recording and announcing of the verdict it appeared\r\nthat the jury were 19 in number, and after their deliberations the\r\nforeman declared that 13 were for finding a verdict one way and 6 for\r\nanother; that Mr. Whyte dictated the verdict to the Coroner, and the\r\nCoroner asked the 13 men if that was what they agreed to. Mr. Whyte's\r\nstatement was that the jury, through the foreman, stated what their\r\nverdict was; that he wrote it down, and that the Coroner asked him for\r\nwhat he had written, and used it himself. But in addition to that, when\r\nthe jury came in the Coroner and Mr. Whyte divided them--placed them\r\napart while the verdict was being written--and then said to the 13 men,\r\n\"Is that what you agree to?\" Such apparent misconduct it was hardly\r\npossible to conceive in anybody occupying a judicial position as did the\r\nCoroner, and especially a Coroner who had an inquisition quashed before.\r\nWhat he had mentioned was sufficient to call forth the emphatic decision\r\nof the court quashing the proceedings, which, however, were also\r\nimpeached on the grounds of its insufficiency and irregularity, and of\r\nthe character of the finding itself. It was not until the Coroner had\r\nbeen threatened with the consequences of his contempt that he made a\r\nreturn to the visit of _certiorari_, and it was then found that out of\r\nten so-called depositions only one contained any signature--that of Dr.\r\nClarke's, which was one of those lost by the clergyman, and not before\r\nthe jury on the 1st September. He (the Lord Chief-Justice) had tried to\r\nread the documents, but in vain--they were of such a scrawling and\r\nscribbling character, but, as he had said, all were incomplete and\r\nutterly worthless except the one which was not properly before the jury.\r\nThen, what was the finding on this inquisition, which should have been\r\nsubstantially as perfect as an indictment? \"That Mary Anne Gaffney came\r\nby her death, and that the mother of this child, Ellen Gaffney, is\r\nguilty of wilful neglect by not supplying the necessary food and care to\r\nsustain the life of this child.\" Upon what charge could the woman have\r\nbeen implicated on that vague finding? He (his Lordship) could\r\nunderstand its being contended that that amounted argumentatively to a\r\nverdict of manslaughter; but the Coroner issued his warrant and sent\r\nthis woman to prison as being guilty of murder, and she remained in\r\ncustody, as he had already remarked, until discharged by the learned\r\njudge who went the Winter Assizes in December. Upon all of these grounds\r\nthey were clearly of opinion that this inquisition should be quashed,\r\nand Mr. Coroner Gowing having had the self-possession to come there to\r\nshow cause against the conditional order, under such circumstances, must\r\nbear the costs of that argument.\r\n\r\nMr. Fred. Moorhead, who, instructed by Mr. O'Kearney Whyte, appeared for\r\nthe Coroner, asked whether the Court would require, as was usual when\r\ncosts were awarded against a magistrate, an undertaking from the other\r\nside--\r\n\r\nThe Lord Chief-Justice.--That is not to bring an action against the\r\nCoroner, you mean?\r\n\r\nMr. Moorhead.--Yes, my Lord. I think it is a usual undertaking when\r\ncosts are awarded in such a case. I think you ought--\r\n\r\nThe Lord Chief-Justice.--Well, I don't know that we ought, but we most\r\ncertainly will not. (Laughter.)\r\n\r\nMr. David Sherlock, who (instructed by Mr. Archibald W. Disdall)\r\nappeared for Ellen Gaffney.--Rest assured, we certainly will bring an\r\naction.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] I have the authority of Mr. Hennessey, \"the best living\r\nIrish scholar, and a Kerryman to boot,\" for this spelling. I am quite\r\nright, he says, in stating that the people there pronounce the names of\r\nGlenbeigh and Rossbeigh as Glenbéhy and Rossbéhy in three syllables.\r\n\"Bethe,\" pronounced \"behy,\" is the genitive of \"beith,\" the birch, of\r\nwhich there were formerly large woods in Ireland. Glenbehy and Rossbehy\r\nmean the \"Glen,\" and the \"Ross\" or \"wooded point\" of the birch.\r\n\r\n[2] A letter received by me from a Protestant Irish gentleman,\r\nlong an ardent Nationalist, seems to confirm this.

The result is that\r\n    the labourers are masters of the situation, and when they catch a\r\n    vessel with a cargo which it is imperative to land quickly, they\r\n    wait till the work is half done, and then strike for 8s. a day! If\r\n    other labourers are imported, they are boycotted for 'grabbing\r\n    work,' and any one who sells provisions to them is boycotted.\"\r\n\r\n[3] An interesting account of this gentleman, and of his\r\nconnection with the earlier developments of the Irish agitation, given\r\nto me by Mr. Colomb of the R.I.C., will be found at p.38, and in the\r\nAppendix, Note F.\r\n\r\n[4] See Appendix, Note F.\r\n\r\n[5] The name of this blacksmith's son learned in the Law of the\r\nLeague is given in Lord Cowper's Report (2. 18,370) as Michael Healy.\r\nWhile these pages are in the printer's hands the London papers chronicle\r\n(May 25, 1888) the arrest of a person described to me as this\r\nmagistrate's brother, Jeremiah Healy, on a charge of robbing and setting\r\nfire to the Protestant church at Killarney!\r\n\r\n[6] Mr. Colomb sends me, June 30, the following interesting\r\nnote:--The letter of which I gave you a copy was produced in evidence at\r\nKerry Summer Assizes, 1867. J. D. Sheehan, Esq., M.P., is the same man\r\nwho was arrested on the 12th February 1867, and to whom the foregoing\r\nletter, ordering the rising in Killarney, is addressed. He was kept in\r\ncustody for some time, and eventually released, it is believed, on the\r\nunderstanding that he was to keep out of Ireland. He came back in 1873\r\nor 1874 and married the proprietress of a Hotel at Killarney. His\r\nconnection with the Glenbehy evictions is referred to on page 10, and in\r\nNote F of the Appendix I give an interesting account, furnished me by\r\nMr. Colomb, of his activity in connection with the case of the Misses\r\nCurtin at Firies.\r\n\r\n[7] In the time of Henry VIII. these cities waged actual war\r\nwith each other, like Florence and Pisa, by sea and land. Limerick was\r\nthen called \"Little London.\"\r\n\r\n[8] It was on the 17th October 1886 that Mr. Dillon first\r\npromulgated the Plan of Campaign at all at Portumna.\r\n\r\n[9] Mr. Ponsonby's account of this affair will be found in the\r\nAppendix, Note G. The Post-Office Savings Bank deposits at Youghal,\r\nwhich were £3031, 0s. 7d. in 1880, rose to £7038, 7s. 2d. in 1887.\r\n\r\n[10] As to the ability of these tenants to pay their way, one\r\nfact which I have since ascertained sufficiently supports Mr. Tener's\r\ncontention. The deposits in the Postal Savings Banks of the three purely\r\nagricultural towns of Portumna, Woodford, and Loughrea, which in 1880,\r\nthrowing off the shillings and pence, were respectively, £2539, £259,\r\nand £5500, rose in 1887 to £3376, £1350, and £6311, an increase of\r\nnearly £3000.\r\n\r\n[11] Mr. Tener, to whom I sent proofs of these pages, writes to\r\nme (July 18): \"I shall soon execute the decree of the County-Court Judge\r\nHenn against Father Coen for £5, 5s., being two and a half year's\r\nrent.\"\r\n\r\n[12] At a hearing of cases before Judge Henn some time after I\r\nleft Portumna, the Judge was reported in the papers as \"severely\"\r\ncommenting upon the carelessness with which the estate-books were kept,\r\ntenants who were proceeded against for arrears producing \"receipts\" in\r\ncourt. I wrote to Mr. Tener on this subject. Under date of June 5th he\r\nreplied to me: \"Judge Henn did not use the severe language reported.\r\nThere was no reporter present but a local man, and I have reason to\r\nbelieve the report in the _Freeman's Journal_ came from the lawyer of\r\nthe tenants, who is on the staff of that journal. But the tenants are\r\ndrilled not to show the receipts they hold, and to take advantage of\r\nevery little error which they might at once get corrected by calling at\r\nthe estate office. In no case, however, did any wrong occur to any\r\ntenant.\"\r\n\r\n[13] The town and estate proper of Woodford belong to Sir Henry\r\nBurke, Bart. The nearest point to Woodford of Lord Clamicarde's property\r\nis distant one mile from the town. And on the so-called Woodford estate\r\nthere are not \"316 tenants,\" as stated in publications I have seen, but\r\n260.\r\n\r\n[14] Martin Kenny, the \"victim\" of this eviction, is the tenant\r\nto whom the Rev. Mr. Crawford (_vide_ page 118) gave £50 for certain\r\ncattle, in order that he (Kenny) might pay his rent But, although he got\r\nthe £50, he nevertheless suffered himself to be evicted; no doubt\r\nfearing the vengeance of the League should he pay.\r\n\r\n[15] The valuation for taxes of this holding is £7, 15s. for\r\nthe land, and £5 for the presbytery house. The church is exempt.\r\n\r\n[16] Of \"Dr.\" Tully Mr. Tener wrote to me (July 18):\r\n\r\n    \"Tully has the holding at £2, 10s. a year, being 50 per cent, under\r\n    the valuation of the land for taxes, which is £3, 15s. As the total\r\n    valuation with the house (built by him) is only £4, he pays no\r\n    poor-rates. He was in arrears May 1, 1887, of three years for £7,\r\n    10s. Lord Clanricarde offered him, with others, 20 per cent,\r\n    abatement, making for him 70 per cent, under the valuation--and he\r\n    refused!\"\r\n\r\nSince then (on Saturday Sept. 1), Tully has been evicted after a\r\ndramatic \"resistance,\" of which, with instructive incidents attending\r\nit, Mr. Tener sends me an account, to be found in the Appendix, Note H.\r\n\r\n[17] Note H2.\r\n\r\n[18] Mr. Tener writes to me (July 18):\r\n\r\n    \"At Allendarragh, near the scene of Finlay's murder, Thomas Noonan,\r\n    who lately was brave enough to accept the post of process-server\r\n    vacated by that murder, was shot at on the 13th instant. It was on\r\n    the highway. He heard a heavy stone fall from a wall on the road and\r\n    turned to see what caused it. He distinctly saw two men behind the\r\n    wall with guns, and saw them fire. One shot struck a stone in the\r\n    road very near him--the other went wide. His idea is that one gun\r\n    dislodged the stone on which it had been laid for an aim, and that\r\n    its fall disturbed the aim and saved him. He fully identifies one of\r\n    the men as Henry Bowles, a nephew of 'Dr.' Tully, who lives with\r\n    Tully, and Bowles, after being arrested and examined at Woodford,\r\n    has been remanded, bail being refused, to Galway Jail. Before this\r\n    shooting Noonan had served a notice from me upon Tully, against whom\r\n    I have Judge Henn's decree for three years' rent, and whose equity\r\n    of redemption expired July 9th.\"\r\n\r\n[19] I have since learned that my jarvey was well informed. Sir\r\nHenry Burke actually paid Mr. Dillon £160 for the maintenance of his\r\ntenants while out of their farms. This, two other landlords, Lords\r\nDunsandle and Westmeath, refused to do, but, like Sir Henry, they both\r\npaid all the costs, and accepted a \"League\" reduction of 5s. 6d. and 6s.\r\nin the pound (June 9, 1888).\r\n\r\n[20] Down to the date at which I write this note (June 9), Mr.\r\nSeigne has kindly, but without results, endeavoured to get for me some\r\nauthentic return made by a small tenant-farmer of his incomings and\r\noutgoings.\r\n\r\n[21] Note I.\r\n\r\n[22] Note K.\r\n\r\n[23] While these pages are going through the press a Scottish\r\nfriend sends me the following extract from a letter published in the\r\n_Scotsman_ of July 25:--\r\n\r\n    \"In the same way I, in August last, when in Wicklow, ascertained as\r\n    carefully as I could the facts as to the Bodyke evictions; and being\r\n    desirous to learn now if that estate was still out of cultivation,\r\n    as I had found it in August, I wrote the gentleman I have referred\r\n    to above. His reply is as follows:--\r\n\r\n       \"'I can answer your question as far as the Brooke estate is\r\n       concerned. None of the tenants are back in their farms, nor\r\n       are they likely to be. The landlord has the land partly\r\n       stocked with cattle; but I may say the land is nearly waste;\r\n       the gates, fences, and farmsteads partly destroyed. I was at\r\n       the fair of Coolgreany about three weeks ago, and the country\r\n       looked quite changed; the weeds predominating in the land\r\n       that the tenantry had under cultivation when they were\r\n       evicted from their farms. The landlord has done nothing to\r\n       lay the land down with grass seed, consequently the land is\r\n       waste. The village of Coolgreany is on the property, and\r\n       there was a good monthly fair held there, but it is very much\r\n       gone down since the disagreement between the landlord and\r\n       tenant. The tenants, speaking generally, in allowing\r\n       themselves to be evicted and not redeeming before six months,\r\n       are giving up all their improvements to the landlord, no\r\n       matter what they may be worth. I have got quite tired of the\r\n       vexed question, and may say I have given up reading about\r\n       evictions, and pity the tenant who is foolish enough to allow\r\n       any party to advise him so badly as to allow himself to be\r\n       evicted.'\r\n\r\n    \"Those who read this testimony of a candid witness, and remember the\r\n    cordial footing on which Mr. Brooke stood with his tenantry in\r\n    Bodyke before Mr. Billon appeared amongst them, may well ask what\r\n    good his interference did to the now impoverished tenantry of\r\n    Bodyke, or to the district now deserted or laid waste.--I am, etc.,\r\n\r\n    A RADICAL UNIONIST.\"\r\n\r\n[24] In curious confirmation of this opinion expressed to me by\r\na man of the country in March, I find in the _Dublin Express_ of July\r\n19th this official news from the Athy Vice-Guardians:\r\n\r\n    \"At the meeting of the Vice-Guardians of the Athy Union yesterday, a\r\n    letter was read from Mr. G. Finlay, Auditor, in which he stated that\r\n    the two sureties of Collector Kealy, of the Luggacurren district,\r\n    had been evicted from their holdings by Lord Lansdowne, and were not\r\n    now in possession of any lands there. They were allowed outdoor\r\n    relief to the extent of £1 a week each on the ground of destitution.\r\n    The Auditor continued: 'The Collector tells me that they both\r\n    possess other lands, and have money in bank. The Collector is\r\n    satisfied that they are as good, if not better, securities for the\r\n    amount of his bond now than at the time they became sureties for\r\n    him. The Clerk of the Union concurs in this opinion.'\r\n\r\n    \"It was ordered to bring the matter under the notice of the Board.\"\r\n\r\n[25] _Explanatory Note attached to First Edition._--After this\r\nchapter had actually gone to press, I received a letter from the friend\r\nwho had put me into communication with the labourers referred to in it,\r\nbegging me to strike out all direct indications of their whereabouts, on\r\nthe ground that these might lead to grave annoyance and trouble for\r\nthese poor men from the local tyrants.\r\n\r\nI do not know that I ought to regret the annoyance thus caused to my\r\npublisher and to me, as no words of mine could emphasise so clearly the\r\nnature and the scope of the odious, illegal, or anti-legal \"coercion\"\r\nestablished in certain parts of Ireland as the asterisks which mark my\r\ncompliance with my friend's request. What can be said for the freedom of\r\na country in which a man of character and position honestly believes it\r\nto be \"dangerous\" for poor men to say the things recorded in the text of\r\nthis chapter about their own feelings, wishes, opinions, and interests?\r\n\r\n[26] It may be well to say here that whatever prominence Mr.\r\nO'Donovan Rossa has had among the Irish in America has been largely, if\r\nnot chiefly, due to the curious persistency of Sir William Harcourt,\r\nwhen a Minister, in making him the ideal Irish-American leader. In and\r\nout of Parliament, Sir William Harcourt continually spoke of Mr. Rossa\r\nas of a kind of Irish Jupiter Tonans, wielding all the terrors of\r\ndynamite from beyond the Atlantic. This was a source of equal amusement\r\nto the Irish-American organisers in America and satisfaction to Mr.\r\nRossa himself. I remember that when a question arose of excluding Mr.\r\nRossa from an important Irish-American convention at Philadelphia, as\r\nnot being the delegate of any recognised Irish-American body, Mr.\r\nSullivan told me that he should recommend the admission of Mr. Rossa to\r\nthe floor without a right to deliberative action, expressly because his\r\npresence, when reported, would be a cause of terror to Sir William\r\nHarcourt.\r\n\r\n[27] See Appendix, Note M.\r\n\r\n[28] Note N.\r\n\r\n[29] Note O.",
